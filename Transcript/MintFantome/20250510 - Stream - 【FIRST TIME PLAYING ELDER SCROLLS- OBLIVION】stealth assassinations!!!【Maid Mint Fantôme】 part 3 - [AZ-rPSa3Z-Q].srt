1
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,980
Cha-cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha...

2
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,850
Hello everybody!

3
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,130
Welcome back to Oblivion...

4
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,230
Cha, cha, cha, cha, howdy doody.

5
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,170
Hello.

6
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,470
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

7
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:33,270
If I sound a little different, it's because... Oh, wait, I just pressed something weird.

8
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:34,310
Wait, no.

9
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,590
It's because I got a new mic.

10
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,330
So I might sound a little different.

11
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:58,290
And if it sounds like a... Like a... Like a... If it sounds like a peak sometimes or something... That might be... That might be why.

12
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,230
I'm still messing with the settings, so... Yes.

13
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,150
But... Check, check, check.

14
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,590
Mic, check.

15
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,430
One, two.

16
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,990
Mintus, sexitus.

17
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,510
No.

18
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:18,990
No.

19
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,450
Pretty good mic.

20
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,730
I'd say so.

21
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,150
It cost me enough that it should be pretty good.

22
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,630
What kind of mic?

23
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,750
It's my first ever big girl mic.

24
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,230
I got it so that... Oh my god.

25
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,410
I can't hear myself talk.

26
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,630
I got it.

27
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,290
Because I have lots of things to record.

28
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,110
And I wanted it to be... I don't have time to go to a studio.

29
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:55,090
So I was like, well, if I get a big girl mic... Then I can just record at home and it will sound good.

30
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,470
I don't know about studio quality.

31
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,870
But... It's a nice mic.

32
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,370
I looked up what mic Taylor Swift uses.

33
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,170
Her mic is...

34
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,570
$10,000.

35
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,850
I did not buy that.

36
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,710
Good news.

37
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,930
My Minto mug has shipped.

38
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,090
Yippee!

39
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,830
I saw... I saw one person post theirs on Twitter, so...

40
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,470
Mint is a Swifty.

41
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,370
No!

42
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:36,530
I, uh... Googled... I don't remember what I Googled, but you know how sometimes it will say, like, uh... It will give you, like, a little... A little... Not the AI.

43
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,130
Not the AI overview, but it will give you the drop-down of, like, I guess, frequently asked questions.

44
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,870
And one of them was, what mic does Taylor Swift use?

45
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,270
And I was like, oh, I'm kind of curious.

46
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,870
And I didn't even see the name of it.

47
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,890
I just saw the price.

48
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,390
My eyes turned into money, money signs, and I was like, wow!

49
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,210
Um...

50
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,430
My mug and pushpins arrived a couple days ago.

51
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,030
Thank you for getting them!

52
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,230
But my mic...

53
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,970
Uh...

54
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,890
Is the Newman...

55
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,950
TLM-103.

56
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,050
And you might also gasp at the price, because it's, uh...

57
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,030
Yeah.

58
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,330
But I was like, I want that studio quality, baby!

59
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,330
So...

60
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,210
Maybe it sounds sturdy or quality.

61
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,270
New man.

62
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,930
New man!

63
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,830
I suppose I can contribute to the peasant ghost's mic fun.

64
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,730
Since she did rid our fair city of that bothersome wood elf.

65
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,730
No, today we're gonna go...

66
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,490
We're gonna go murder some people.

67
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,430
Wishing a happy May Day.

68
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,730
Thank you!

69
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,090
A Minto streamed during mental breakdown.

70
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,410
Oh!

71
00:06:59,610 --> 00:06:59,950
Oh!

72
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,030
Um...

73
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,690
Be okay.

74
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,630
Down!

75
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,690
Thank you so much for the 20th!

76
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,450
Thank you!

77
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:08,830
Yeah!

78
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,010
Today we murder!

79
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,590
Today...

80
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,090
I murder!

81
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,550
I murder!

82
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,510
I'm for self murder!

83
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,750
I'm for self murder!

84
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,250
I'm for self murder!

85
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,830
Do you think if they made a million dollar, Mike Taylor Swift would use it?

86
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,230
Probably!

87
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:27,870
Probably!

88
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,410
Probably, huh?

89
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,590
Yeah, today we're gonna murder...

90
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,210
Murder...

91
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:33,990
And...

92
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,570
Um...

93
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,610
Mordor...

94
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,290
And...

95
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:40,650
I don't know!

96
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,230
I guess we'll get my horse back!

97
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,810
I missed the plush in the mug!

98
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,750
Oh!

99
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,970
The mug was restocked!

100
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,370
So...

101
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,450
Um...

102
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,230
Calamity...

103
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,350
If you missed it...

104
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,750
And you...

105
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,270
I probably should've posted it on YouTube...

106
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,730
My bad...

107
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,010
I only posted the restock on...

108
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,310
Twitter...

109
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,990
But it...

110
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,990
Oh!

111
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,270
It sold out again!

112
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,310
Oh!

113
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,030
Oh!

114
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,490
Oh!

115
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,790
I did not know...

116
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,590
Oh my gosh!

117
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:26,730
Oh my gosh!

118
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,250
But it was a...

119
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,150
It was a small quantity...

120
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,250
Of restock!

121
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,790
Like, it wasn't...

122
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,290
Crazy!

123
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:34,990
So...

124
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,590
Thank you so much!

125
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,770
Holy moly!

126
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,170
Oh my gosh!

127
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,150
Kanye East!

128
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,110
Thank you for the...

129
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,170
Thank you so much for the...

130
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:42,230
Thank you so much for the...

131
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,490
I'll become a channel member as soon...

132
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,510
As well as soon...

133
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,290
Once I figure out how to...

134
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,010
LOL iOS problems...

135
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,450
Is that a problem on there?

136
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,610
Also...

137
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,600
ClArthur's gonna defeat the gang stalker...

138
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,210
What is that?

139
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,130
Skin grad...

140
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,890
Hiya Mito!

141
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,870
It's mine and Kermit's birthday today!

142
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,810
Could I get a happy birthday?

143
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,530
Happy birthday!

144
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,910
Enter name here!

145
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,230
And also...

146
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,690
Kermit!

147
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,490
Wait, like...

148
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,150
Kermit the frog?

149
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,770
No way...

150
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,540
No way it's that guy's birthday...

151
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,850
Don't do it on mobile...

152
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,580
It costs more...

153
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,140
For membership?

154
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,360
It does?

155
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,540
No way!

156
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,120
Seriously?

157
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,900
It costs more?

158
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,000
iOS tax...

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,280
Oh!

160
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,600
I try to keep my memberships low anyway...

161
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Cause I'm like...

162
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,680
I know probably so many people wanna have memberships for...

163
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,680
For other...

164
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,600
Uh... VTubers...

165
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,700
I don't do so many...

166
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,980
Membership streams anyway...

167
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,700
I don't really have much to post...

168
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,200
So...

169
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,120
I was like...

170
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,500
I'll try and keep it cheap...

171
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,680
So that...

172
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,660
Um...

173
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,820
So that...

174
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,880
You can feel like...

175
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,740
You're not spending so much on it...

176
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,540
Uh...

177
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,480
Thank you so much for the...

178
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,400
Thank you!

179
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,400
Effect yourself!

180
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:08,900
Oh my gosh!

181
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,540
Thank you for the...

182
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,140
Thank you so much!

183
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,720
Thank you!

184
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,340
Oh my gosh!

185
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,420
Thank you for the...

186
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,380
Squid!

187
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,240
Welcome to membership!

188
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:16,980
Thank you!

189
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,720
Thank you!

190
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,360
Thank you!

191
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,920
It's a bargain!

192
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,360
Why?

193
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,300
Well, like I said...

194
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,040
You get the emotes...

195
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,780
I don't...

196
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:23,960
I...

197
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,320
I...

198
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,260
I did a membership stream yesterday...

199
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,050
Uh...

200
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,760
Uh...

201
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,320
I...

202
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,800
Yeah...

203
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,420
I do...

204
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,720
I'm kind of whenever...

205
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:33,920
Thank you!

206
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,380
Thank you!

207
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,520
Thank you!

208
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,540
Thank you for the gift of...

209
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,090
I feel like you could charge more...

210
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,500
No!

211
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,040
It's okay!

212
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,780
Like I said...

213
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,960
I...

214
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,660
I...

215
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,540
I...

216
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:49,980
I...

217
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,200
I am so comfortable...

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,540
I...

219
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,000
I...

220
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,240
I don't need to charge more...

221
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
I think it would be...

222
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,540
Way too much...

223
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,540
Probably...

224
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,420
Hmm...

225
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,640
But yeah...

226
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,160
But yeah...

227
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,280
Well...

228
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,330
Oh gosh!

229
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:15,690
No!

230
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,770
This is not the...

231
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,270
Send us...

232
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,990
Not the gifting membership time!

233
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,170
Well...

234
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,070
Thank you so much for the...

235
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,130
Thank you so much for the...

236
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,290
Thank you guys!

237
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,190
Thank you!

238
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,090
What about a higher tier that does nothing?

239
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:28,550
No!

240
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,370
Did you see the new look...

241
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,830
Look up...

242
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:33,850
Look up...

243
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,110
Shiroko and Hoshino figures...

244
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,750
Oh yes!

245
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,290
I did!

246
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,590
But yeah...

247
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,050
Sadly...

248
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,450
No Koharu...

249
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,090
My girl is always shafted...

250
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,550
Happy May Day!

251
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,790
Happy May Day!

252
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,170
Wee!

253
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,950
Alfredo!

254
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,730
Thank you so much for the...

255
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,050
Tag gifted Deku!

256
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,790
Gotta super to balance out the cheap memberships...

257
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,290
No...

258
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,250
Guys, I'll be honest...

259
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,630
Today I had kind of a poopy day...

260
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,810
So I'm feeling a little...

261
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,850
Feeling a little...

262
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,150
So I'm gonna take out my anger...

263
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,690
On these three guys...

264
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,150
I'm gonna murder them...

265
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,710
I'm gonna murder them...

266
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,150
But hopefully it was a good day for you...

267
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,030
Maybe after this...

268
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,850
I'll get some pizza...

269
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,670
Fra...

270
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,850
It's Friday...

271
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,850
Friday pizza...

272
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,850
Friday pizza time...

273
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:29,990
Okay...

274
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,610
Been so long...

275
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,050
No regrets!

276
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,010
Thank you!

277
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,630
Thank you!

278
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:33,990
Thank you!

279
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,650
T-G-I-F, baby!

280
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,170
T-G-I-F!

281
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,570
I just ate some pizza!

282
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,150
Let's go!

283
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,890
Thanks for being you!

284
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,530
Thanks...

285
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,250
Me...

286
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,250
For being me!

287
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,590
So let's get into the game...

288
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,510
Last time...

289
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,590
I got arrested...

290
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,990
And...

291
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,390
Today we're going to...

292
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,490
Skingrad...

293
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,190
And we're gonna...

294
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,670
We were gonna...

295
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:06,910
We...

296
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,810
Okay, last time...

297
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,130
We saw what happened...

298
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,850
If you...

299
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,430
Snitch on...

300
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,470
Glarthor...

301
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,690
But this time...

302
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,850
I think I kinda wanna indulge him...

303
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,970
And murder all the people...

304
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,490
Have you seen that I'm yours to command, sir knight?

305
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,750
I have...

306
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,970
I don't think I have...

307
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,410
Could you take out...

308
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,290
My anger too?

309
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,310
I got so tired at the gym earlier...

310
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,450
That I saw the mirror...

311
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,070
I have dark bags into my eyes...

312
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,130
Like I've been in a fight...

313
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,190
Oh gosh...

314
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,170
If you're at the gym...

315
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,690
You should...

316
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,410
Go to one of the punching bags...

317
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,070
And punch it...

318
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,410
And pretend that it's a real person...

319
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,170
Show your...

320
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,170
Show me your kittens...

321
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,690
Thank you for the...

322
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,190
Thank you...

323
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,070
Thank you...

324
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,350
Thank you...

325
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,030
Thank you...

326
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:48,970
Alright...

327
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,690
Let's try this...

328
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,970
Sure you want to load this game?

329
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:53,690
Yes...

330
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,750
So we're not gonna rat him out...

331
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,330
We're gonna...

332
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:03,810
See...

333
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,730
But I need this guy to leave...

334
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,230
Cause...

335
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,930
Uh...

336
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,350
So basically...

337
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,330
Basically...

338
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:10,770
Oh...

339
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,390
This is E-Tina...

340
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,510
This is E-Tina...

341
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,670
Definitely not E-T in a wig...

342
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,610
As an Italian trained chef...

343
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,950
And recently ranked head chef...

344
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,850
Let me make you that pizza...

345
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,430
Whoa...

346
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,390
Oh...

347
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:29,790
Oh...

348
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,750
Mamma mia...

349
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,350
Real-a pizza...

350
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,350
I'm sorry...

351
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,210
But hey...

352
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,850
We have an American Pope now...

353
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,130
So...

354
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,690
I can say that...

355
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,650
Mamma mia...

356
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,830
Real-a pizza...

357
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,850
Mhahaha...

358
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,630
Deep dish...

359
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,830
Mhahaha...

360
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,810
I don't think that's true...

361
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,950
Mhahaha...

362
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,630
Maybe...

363
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,010
Mhahaha...

364
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:58,490
Mhahaha...

365
00:14:59,390 --> 00:14:59,690
Um...

366
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,650
So we got this...

367
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,750
Cool little note from Glarthur...

368
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,790
And it says...

369
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:04,870
List of death...

370
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,190
And it says...

371
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,830
That these people must be killed...

372
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,310
Which is...

373
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,750
Bernadette...

374
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,090
Penelis...

375
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,070
Tudius...

376
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,050
Sextius...

377
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,650
And...

378
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,950
David...

379
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,080
Cerulier...

380
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,120
I don't actually know where that guy is...

381
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,000
It says kill him first...

382
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,130
Where do I find him?

383
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,870
I actually don't know where he is...

384
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,910
I'm guessing by the...

385
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,330
Look at...

386
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,690
There's Glarthur over there...

387
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,710
I wish I could...

388
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,930
Emote at him...

389
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,270
Hahahaha...

390
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,890
Uh...

391
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,450
It's 1am...

392
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,750
In his home...

393
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,570
Probably...

394
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:45,970
Yeah...

395
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,330
But like...

396
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:46,930
Where is it?

397
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:49,970
Slash dance...

398
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,350
I could go into the other places...

399
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,690
What if I killed all three of them?

400
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,790
In this...

401
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,590
Like...

402
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,170
Like...

403
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,690
In the span of tonight...

404
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:57,970
Like...

405
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,550
So...

406
00:15:59,370 --> 00:15:59,930
Sneakily...

407
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,970
Nobody cares that I'm wandering around...

408
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,970
At night...

409
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,970
I'm such a mis...

410
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,260
I'm a mysterious creature of the night...

411
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,450
I think...

412
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,240
Sextius is...

413
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,110
Actually...

414
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,040
This city is so...

415
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,670
I don't know where anything is actually...

416
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,280
I have to go outside for the vineyard...

417
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,650
All the city are pretty mazy...

418
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:36,470
Are they?

419
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,950
Oh, this is Sextius' house!

420
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,330
I do remember...

421
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,030
Yes, see, see...

422
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,570
I knew, I knew...

423
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,070
Well...

424
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,570
Tutius Sextius...

425
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,530
Tutius Sextius...

426
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,420
Alright...

427
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,880
What a name...

428
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,620
I know...

429
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,860
Wow...

430
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,760
It's a beautiful night...

431
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,320
Um...

432
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,540
I went on the wrong side...

433
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,860
That's okay...

434
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,700
I think it's the other side...

435
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,920
Is the vineyard...

436
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,340
The west gate...

437
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,720
Skingrad...

438
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,920
This place is cursed...

439
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,920
You got Tutius Sextius...

440
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,020
Uh...

441
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,700
If you...

442
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,920
It's called Skingrad...

443
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,920
You got Glarthur...

444
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,500
Greetings!

445
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,820
I think this city...

446
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,500
Just needs to...

447
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,880
It...

448
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,580
It can...

449
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,000
It...

450
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,260
It...

451
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,080
Doesn't need...

452
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,500
It...

453
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,040
Can...

454
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,240
Wait, am I going the right way?

455
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,160
Look at this!

456
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,740
There's a little...

457
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,560
There's a...

458
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,840
Training...

459
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,240
Archery...

460
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,080
Needs to burn?

461
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:44,960
Yeah...

462
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,180
Hello from Akiva!

463
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,560
I went to Deer Stage...

464
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,660
But they were fully booked up...

465
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,220
I told...

466
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,060
Them about...

467
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,320
Wait...

468
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,540
I told them a VTuber recommended it...

469
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,000
And they asked if it was you...

470
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,620
There were some other Wisps...

471
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,220
And they let me join their table...

472
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,720
Everyone there is so nice!

473
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,000
Wait, I think I saw your pictures...

474
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,340
You guys are so cute...

475
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,140
Also...

476
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,520
I saw...

477
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,200
I saw comments about...

478
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,220
I tried to fix some of the graphics of the game...

479
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,980
So hopefully...

480
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,780
It looks fine on my end...

481
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,400
But if it looks a little wonky...

482
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,800
On your guys' end...

483
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,980
Just let me know, okay?

484
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,220
I'll try and fix some more...

485
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,680
But yeah...

486
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
I think I saw your pictures...

487
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,700
And you guys saw my Oshi ID...

488
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,860
She's so stinking cute...

489
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:27,900
Wait...

490
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,100
I'm back at the church...

491
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh shoot...

492
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,780
I went in a big old circle...

493
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,240
Looks fine?

494
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:34,780
Looks good?

495
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,340
Oh, good, good...

496
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,260
I tried...

497
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,500
I tried taking...

498
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,800
I saw comments...

499
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,300
And I was like...

500
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,440
I will follow...

501
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,300
The recommendations...

502
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,340
So thank you...

503
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,980
All who gave...

504
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,420
The recommendations...

505
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,640
Wait...

506
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:48,780
I'm...

507
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,300
Oh, this is the West Gate...

508
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:51,880
Ugh...

509
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,300
Here we go...

510
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,380
Okay...

511
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,300
Let's go kill David...

512
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,220
David...

513
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,720
David...

514
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,640
David...

515
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,420
Do you think he's...

516
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,500
Oh...

517
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,270
Sorry, my...

518
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,430
My computer just acted weird...

519
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,170
David...

520
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,270
David...

521
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,350
If I were David...

522
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,630
Where would my house be?

523
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,110
He's not in the stables...

524
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,610
He's in the vineyard...

525
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,510
But where is his house?

526
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,250
Oh gosh...

527
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,450
My computer's acting really weird...

528
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,430
Okay, hold on...

529
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,930
Give me a second...

530
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,890
I don't know why I was fine last time...

531
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,610
Let's do this...

532
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,190
Okay...

533
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,430
Should be fine though...

534
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,030
They're at the red markers?

535
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,130
No...

536
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,030
I don't think so...

537
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,850
Oh wait...

538
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,910
Maybe...

539
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,670
Wait...

540
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,030
Whose house is that?

541
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,650
Can we be for sure?

542
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,230
The house was in town...

543
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,790
You saw it before...

544
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,010
I did?

545
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,610
Hello...

546
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,020
Oh wait...

547
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,580
Okay...

548
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,560
So we have three houses...

549
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,980
Oh...

550
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,320
Oh...

551
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,840
I see...

552
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,760
Okay...

553
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,280
So this must lead to...

554
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,120
David...

555
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
Probably...

556
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,000
Greetings...

557
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,660
Is it here?

558
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,460
Yes...

559
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,140
Oh, they're brothers...

560
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,240
Okay...

561
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,600
Do you think anybody will notice...

562
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:23,960
If I...

563
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,240
Oh wait...

564
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,820
It's a hard one...

565
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,960
Okay...

566
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,000
Talk Mr. M...

567
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,020
Thank you for the five guests...

568
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,680
Thank you...

569
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,840
Okay...

570
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,180
Okay...

571
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,000
I remember how to do this...

572
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,040
Oh...

573
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,300
Like so?

574
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,200
You should probably save first...

575
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,900
Oh, it's okay...

576
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,480
We still have a...

577
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,740
We're right by next to the church...

578
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,060
I think...

579
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,380
So...

580
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,260
I have my other save...

581
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,200
It's like a rhythm game...

582
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,300
It's like a rhythm game...

583
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,960
Oh...

584
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,100
Oh...

585
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,960
Whoa...

586
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
Whoa...

587
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,680
Whoa...

588
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,530
Okay...

589
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,490
After...

590
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,510
After last time...

591
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,110
I was like...

592
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,150
I will not be bested by these locks again...

593
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,190
Oh...

594
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,510
First try, baby...

595
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,170
First try...

596
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,490
Hey...

597
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:39,550
Hey...

598
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,470
Okay...

599
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,780
I got my fists...

600
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,860
Wait...

601
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,800
Let's get my...

602
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,160
Uh...

603
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,360
My bow and arrow...

604
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,000
Ooh...

605
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
They should be asleep...

606
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,120
No?

607
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,760
Your honor...

608
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,100
She's cracked...

609
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,560
If I were a brother...

610
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,120
I'd be upstairs...

611
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,100
Sleeping...

612
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,620
Oh...

613
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,820
That's the basement...

614
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,800
Don't care...

615
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,100
Let's go upstairs...

616
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,320
I'm scared...

617
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,040
Yeah, I heard the root...

618
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,880
I heard it...

619
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,220
Wait...

620
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:19,740
What?

621
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,160
Wait...

622
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,220
What?

623
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,740
Hm...

624
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,140
Wait, what?

625
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,640
Wait...

626
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,440
Where did I...

627
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,560
Huh?

628
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,540
Wait...

629
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,020
No...

630
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,480
No...

631
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,280
No...

632
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,140
No...

633
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,210
Heard somebody...

634
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,030
It was...

635
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,170
This...

636
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,550
Oh my gosh...

637
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,130
Wait...

638
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,790
Do you think that guy will notice?

639
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,710
Do you think that guy will care?

640
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,020
Wait...

641
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,400
Where's their...

642
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,020
Where...

643
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,800
Their house is...

644
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,580
What?

645
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,880
What?

646
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,300
Oh, is it...

647
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,220
I literally...

648
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,620
Did not read...

649
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,440
Are they in the basement?

650
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,110
First try...

651
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,970
Stairs to the left?

652
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,570
Oh...

653
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,810
Wait...

654
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,910
Hold on...

655
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,690
Okay...

656
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,170
Stairs to the left?

657
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,290
I'm blind...

658
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:36,950
No...

659
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,380
I'm so blind...

660
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,250
Oh...

661
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,460
Alright...

662
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,290
I'm sneaking...

663
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,240
I'm sneaking...

664
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,090
I hear the root...

665
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,950
My sneak has increased...

666
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,200
Equip arrows?

667
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,420
Wait...

668
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:07,920
What do you mean?

669
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,400
Doesn't it...

670
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,680
Doesn't it do that by itself?

671
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,080
Oh no...

672
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,140
Steel arrow...

673
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,740
There we go...

674
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,700
Thank you...

675
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,410
Okay...

676
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,310
Hold on...

677
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,470
I'm gonna make a hard save...

678
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,910
Save game...

679
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,150
Wait...

680
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:30,970
What time is it anyway?

681
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,630
Let's...

682
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,550
Save game...

683
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,490
New save...

684
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,120
Who are you?

685
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
I found him!

686
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,140
I can pick his pockets...

687
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,140
He got 10 gold...

688
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,460
I'm gonna take his house key...

689
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,120
What do you think you're doing?

690
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,720
Oh my god...

691
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,260
How are you alive?

692
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,760
Or...

693
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,180
How are you awake?

694
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,340
By the Nine Divines...

695
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:54,640
Assault!

696
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,320
Assault!

697
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,700
Assault!

698
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,060
Assault!

699
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,260
Assault!

700
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,480
I have killed David...

701
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,100
Davide...

702
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,760
Davide...

703
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,960
As Glarthur requested...

704
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:12,840
Oh...

705
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,660
When I have killed everyone on Glarthur's list...

706
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,820
I should meet him at midnight...

707
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,960
Behind the great chapel for my payment...

708
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,980
Let's go...

709
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,160
And take the route...

710
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,340
How did he feel his pockets getting stolen from?

711
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:25,940
Um...

712
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,540
I'm leaving...

713
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,140
So nobody knows I was ever here...

714
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,060
Or I could...

715
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,620
Let's see...

716
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,400
What else is in here?

717
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:34,860
Oh!

718
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,300
This is a door to Skingrod...

719
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,520
I'm stupid...

720
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,460
Oh my god...

721
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,900
How cute!

722
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,520
They got a little balcony...

723
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,840
Aww...

724
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,900
Two sisters...

725
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,360
Lodge!

726
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,840
I just killed a brother...

727
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,960
I just killed one brother...

728
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,840
Wait a second...

729
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,400
I got the key!

730
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:57,880
Did I not?

731
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Why do I have to...

732
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
Why do I have to use this?

733
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,150
Two sisters...

734
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,270
One brother...

735
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,170
Somebody sees me...

736
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,250
Wait, who?

737
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,030
Oh, you're right...

738
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,510
Whomst?

739
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,010
Who is seeing me?

740
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:15,770
Oh, wait...

741
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,610
Where?

742
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:17,770
Where?

743
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:18,830
How?

744
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,930
Not anymore...

745
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,610
That's weird...

746
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,430
He didn't get it...

747
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,370
Because he woke up...

748
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,210
Seriously?

749
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,770
Wait...

750
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm so good at this now...

751
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,620
I'm too good at this scam...

752
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,840
Wait, who sees me?

753
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,580
Oh my god...

754
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,240
Stop right there...

755
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,580
Nobody breaks the law on my watch...

756
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,040
Oh...

757
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,940
I'm confiscating your stolen goods...

758
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,420
Now pay your fine...

759
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,590
Or it's off to jail...

760
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,330
Um...

761
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,790
Maybe I should reload...

762
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,400
Maybe I should reload...

763
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,740
Then pay with your blood!

764
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,280
Load game...

765
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,400
This one...

766
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,600
Yes...

767
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,160
Was it because...

768
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,900
Did he hear him?

769
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,840
So I have to kill him first...

770
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,660
I have to kill him in his sleep...

771
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,700
I have to kill him in his sleep...

772
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:47,980
I have to kill him in his sleep...

773
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,260
By the Nine Divines...

774
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:49,620
Assault!

775
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,260
Assault!

776
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,100
He's fine...

777
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,430
Who opened the door?

778
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,200
Oh...

779
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,120
Oh...

780
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,700
Um...

781
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,380
Wait...

782
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,340
Um...

783
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,940
I...

784
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,720
I don't know what to do...

785
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,580
I think I should kill him...

786
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,820
By the Nine Divines...

787
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,140
Assault!

788
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,820
Assault!

789
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,120
Stop!

790
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,000
What?!

791
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,900
You violated the law!

792
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,440
Pay the court a fine...

793
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,500
Or serve your sentence!

794
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,540
Your stolen goods are now...

795
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,100
Forfeit!

796
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,240
No!

797
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,460
Where did you come from?

798
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,120
Oh...

799
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,460
That was a sting operation...

800
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,320
He's like peeking through the door!

801
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,300
Oh...

802
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,520
How much is the fine?

803
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,480
80 gold, that's it!

804
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,300
I think we have that...

805
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,280
Well, obviously we have that...

806
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,860
Because I can...

807
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,680
Um...

808
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,440
What if I...

809
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,480
That's too bad!

810
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,880
I was hoping you'd resist arrest...

811
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,320
Here's Johnny!

812
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,180
Okay...

813
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,500
Here's the procedure...

814
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:31,960
Okay...

815
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,300
We go to the castle...

816
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,920
First, we search you...

817
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,280
Confiscate any stolen goods...

818
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,140
I didn't take anything!

819
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,940
Then you pay your fine...

820
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,880
And we release you...

821
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,500
Oh!

822
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,060
Oh!

823
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:42,920
Oh!

824
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,840
Wait, wait, wait!

825
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,120
No!

826
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,760
No!

827
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,320
Um...

828
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,500
Wait a second...

829
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,340
My game...

830
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,480
My game...

831
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,500
I'm reloading...

832
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,260
The Nirn rule...

833
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,060
I didn't take that!

834
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,700
Let's see...

835
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,380
How can I kill him...

836
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,460
In one...

837
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,300
Swoop!

838
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,320
I think the...

839
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,720
Sword would be better...

840
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,600
Maybe with the dagger...

841
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,700
Can I use the blade of woe?

842
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,620
The blade of woe!

843
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,480
Daggers do more stealth damage if you have one...

844
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,020
Is that...

845
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,640
Is this a dagger?

846
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,480
Oh, it looks like a dagger...

847
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,640
Blade of woe!

848
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,590
Let's try it...

849
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,430
She's too good...

850
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,240
Okay, this is my first time stabbing a person...

851
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,800
Shut up!

852
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,780
I stole...

853
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,350
Okay, here I go...

854
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,980
No!

855
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,920
Assault!

856
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,020
Am I supposed to be impressed?

857
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,280
Uh...

858
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,220
That didn't work...

859
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,800
Okay, hold on...

860
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,840
We're gonna get this!

861
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,520
We're gonna...

862
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,400
We're gonna get this!

863
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,780
Do I have to shut the door?

864
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,620
Will that make it so that...

865
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:32,980
They don't...

866
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,340
Don't...

867
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,380
Use a power attack?

868
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,140
What's that?

869
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,840
Wait, what's a power attack?

870
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,500
Use a gun!

871
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,040
Okay...

872
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,100
Shut up!

873
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,280
Shut up!

874
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,440
Hold the attack button down...

875
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,840
Okay...

876
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,160
Alright, we're just...

877
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,880
Chillin' in this guy's room...

878
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
Oh, wait...

879
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
No, no, no...

880
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,480
Uh...

881
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,060
You...

882
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,900
Blade of Woe...

883
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,060
Blade of Keanu Reeves...

884
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,320
Whoa...

885
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,880
Alright...

886
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,880
Hold the click...

887
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,580
Oh...

888
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,920
I think somebody...

889
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,860
Oh...

890
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,360
No, no...

891
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,920
Die you...

892
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,360
Die you...

893
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,020
Wait...

894
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,920
How are you still alive?

895
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,540
How are you still alive?

896
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:38,800
Oh...

897
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,980
How are you still alive?

898
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,660
Whoa!

899
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:44,920
Oh...

900
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,360
I think he just died...

901
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,650
A little bit of privacy?

902
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,610
Is that what you wanted?

903
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,430
Oh...

904
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,420
By the nine divines!

905
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:04,940
Assault!

906
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,620
Assault!

907
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,920
Oh my god!

908
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,580
He knows magic!

909
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:09,980
Ah...

910
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,540
Ah...

911
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,620
Oh...

912
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,720
He decided to peek out from under the bed...

913
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,220
Now run...

914
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,000
Run...

915
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,560
Ah...

916
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,380
There's no way I can do this!

917
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,360
Guys, I think I need to come back to this...

918
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,220
I think I need to come back to this quest once I'm stronger...

919
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,360
Maybe...

920
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,580
Maybe once I can...

921
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,020
Once I...

922
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,800
Once I...

923
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,640
Once I...

924
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,200
Am...

925
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,740
Uh...

926
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,980
Hmm...

927
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,820
Once I can...

928
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,060
One shot him...

929
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,280
You know?

930
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,900
You are only level two?

931
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,440
Yeah...

932
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,940
I'm only level two...

933
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,920
Uh...

934
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,520
Yeah...

935
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,940
Then pay with your blood!

936
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,460
Then pay with your blood!

937
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,920
Oh, I think he poisoned me...

938
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,080
You elves are all the same!

939
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:06,640
Oh, shoot!

940
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,360
All flash and no fury!

941
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,180
I'm...

942
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,560
Oh gosh, this guy is tough!

943
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,060
Okay...

944
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,600
Let's load the game...

945
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,060
I'm gonna leave...

946
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,000
We're gonna leave the brother's house...

947
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,180
Can you headshot?

948
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,840
I tried!

949
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,380
I did try!

950
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,340
I don't think it...

951
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,580
I don't think it did much...

952
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:23,820
Okay...

953
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,040
Let's leave...

954
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,180
See you later...

955
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,220
I will be back...

956
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,260
But...

957
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,660
I am going to...

958
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,260
Ransack your...

959
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,860
Other...

960
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,160
Oh...

961
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,420
This is a door to outside...

962
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,280
I'm so stupid...

963
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,780
Oh no...

964
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,580
Wait...

965
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,680
Wait...

966
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,380
Nobody see me?

967
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,160
I'm an idiot...

968
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,940
I thought it was a place to loot...

969
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,480
Oh shoot...

970
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,320
In my...

971
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,640
In my...

972
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,730
Just jump down...

973
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,620
They'll see me...

974
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,050
I think...

975
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,500
No?

976
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,840
Wait a second...

977
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,090
I can loot these though...

978
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,180
Nothing...

979
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,200
Any money?

980
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,320
You're a success...

981
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,680
Oh...

982
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,480
Repair Hammer...

983
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,720
You're a successful...

984
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,720
You're a successful...

985
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,920
Vineyard...

986
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,680
No...

987
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,970
You should have so much money...

988
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,720
Oh...

989
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,280
Gold...

990
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,740
I see...

991
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,520
Two gold...

992
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,430
Rob them...

993
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,050
Of all they're worth...

994
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,410
Okay...

995
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,610
So not that door...

996
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:40,830
Obviously...

997
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,790
Reinforced door...

998
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,070
Where does it go to?

999
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,510
Okay...

1000
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,530
Alright...

1001
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,130
You got...

1002
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:51,910
An urd?

1003
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,410
Who's in that?

1004
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,100
It's like I wasn't even here...

1005
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,980
It's like I wasn't even here...

1006
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,980
Let's go steal from their basement...

1007
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,610
If you have poison in inventory...

1008
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,230
You could apply it to the arrow...

1009
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,930
Yeah...

1010
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,930
I saw some people saying that I should...

1011
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,040
Try a poison arrow...

1012
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,580
I do want to...

1013
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,220
I...

1014
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:19,580
I...

1015
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,300
Am curious...

1016
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,780
Will the people...

1017
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,020
Oh my gosh...

1018
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,280
It's actual wine...

1019
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,080
I know there's level scaling in this game...

1020
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,500
Do the people also scale with the levels...

1021
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,960
Or is it just like the...

1022
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,200
The big baddies...

1023
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,000
Okay...

1024
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,540
They have a whole lot of nothing...

1025
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:48,720
Wait...

1026
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,060
What's this?

1027
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,840
Upper...

1028
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,200
House...

1029
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,140
House...

1030
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,940
Upper wall hangings...

1031
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,560
This entitles the bearer...

1032
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,620
To various wall hangings...

1033
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,540
That will promptly...

1034
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,900
That will be promptly...

1035
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,640
Delivered to your home...

1036
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,700
In Skingrad...

1037
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,680
Six tapestries...

1038
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,520
Five paintings...

1039
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:08,980
Oh...

1040
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,360
Okay...

1041
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,480
It's so...

1042
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,580
It's worth so much...

1043
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,580
Happy May Day...

1044
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,540
It's also my birthday today...

1045
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,800
Happy birthday...

1046
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,060
Shadow of yore...

1047
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,720
Happy birthday...

1048
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,780
Yay...

1049
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,340
Alright...

1050
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,720
Let's leave...

1051
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,040
What is that green?

1052
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,880
Steal it?

1053
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,220
Wait...

1054
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,140
I already went in here...

1055
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,460
What?

1056
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,620
I have to unlock...

1057
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,400
I have to do it again?

1058
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,100
No!

1059
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,220
I've already done this!

1060
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,440
I'm too good...

1061
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,140
I didn't realize that if I stole it...

1062
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:03,620
Okay...

1063
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,200
Wait...

1064
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,720
So...

1065
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,300
Take...

1066
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,640
I've really improved with my lockpicking, huh?

1067
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,620
Oh...

1068
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,800
And nobody saw...

1069
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,140
Oh...

1070
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,700
Oh...

1071
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,380
Hi Gunther...

1072
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,260
I tried...

1073
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,500
I really did...

1074
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,380
Can I break into...

1075
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,100
Glarthur...

1076
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,340
Sorry...

1077
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,600
Your name's not Gunther...

1078
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,700
Where's your house?

1079
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,220
I'd like to break into there...

1080
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:30,920
What time is it?

1081
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,980
Oh no...

1082
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,620
It's almost 6am...

1083
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,500
It's almost 6am...

1084
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,090
So people are gonna start waking up...

1085
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,480
Okay...

1086
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,180
I'm not talking to you...

1087
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:42,620
Short...

1088
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,720
Shorty...

1089
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,150
Get out of my face...

1090
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,940
Okay...

1091
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,420
We should...

1092
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,720
Nothing...

1093
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,620
I'm almost...

1094
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,480
Wondering...

1095
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,780
I wonder if I get more money...

1096
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,180
By...

1097
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,240
By...

1098
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,280
Killing Glarthur...

1099
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,660
Or if I get more money...

1100
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,740
By killing the three people...

1101
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,220
Um...

1102
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:17,130
Why not both?

1103
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,670
You can cash in both?

1104
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,490
No way...

1105
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,670
Seriously?

1106
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,880
I do wanna see...

1107
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,350
You can grab 800...

1108
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,230
800 dollars...

1109
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,410
800 from his home...

1110
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:34,490
If you turn him in...

1111
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,410
How much do I get...

1112
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,150
If I...

1113
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,310
Greetings to you...

1114
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,430
Greetings...

1115
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:40,850
Well...

1116
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,690
How much do I get...

1117
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,390
If I kill the people?

1118
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,750
Isn't it a thousand or something?

1119
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,110
800 bucks...

1120
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,050
Let's see...

1121
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:48,470
Okay...

1122
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,930
Um...

1123
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,330
I want to go...

1124
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,810
Find my horse...

1125
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,070
So I think we'll do that for now...

1126
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,850
What is it now?

1127
00:39:59,230 --> 00:39:59,790
Uh...

1128
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,990
But it was...

1129
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:01,810
Oh golly...

1130
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,210
1000 if you kill them...

1131
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,450
Kill first, get paid...

1132
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,330
Then take the 800...

1133
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,470
I think that's what we'll do...

1134
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:08,570
Huh?

1135
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,090
We'll blame it all on him...

1136
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,650
Wouldn't that be the best option?

1137
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,560
We...

1138
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,280
Got locked up at...

1139
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,880
Kvatch...

1140
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,500
So let's journey that way...

1141
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,260
I get you're trying to sneak around...

1142
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,500
But the guards keep getting alerted...

1143
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,000
Oh, I'm on the wrong...

1144
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,620
The wrong way...

1145
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,040
Yeah...

1146
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,400
Yeah...

1147
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,500
We can just blame him...

1148
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,640
It's the perfect crime...

1149
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,980
I just have to get stronger...

1150
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,640
Hello lady...

1151
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,560
Lady who's doing necromancy...

1152
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,640
She's kind of a freak...

1153
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,080
Have pity...

1154
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,600
Beautiful lady...

1155
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,140
What?

1156
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,280
Did he just...

1157
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,260
Call me a beautiful lady?

1158
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,220
Uh...

1159
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,300
Okay...

1160
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,660
Um...

1161
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,460
Hail...

1162
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,720
Oh, he said hail...

1163
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,640
Have a pity...

1164
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,640
Beautiful lady...

1165
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,320
Poor sucker doesn't know I'm E.T.

1166
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:22,890
in a wig...

1167
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,640
Alright, let's go get my horse back...

1168
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,080
We gotta go to...

1169
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,140
Kvatch...

1170
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm on the right path, right?

1171
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:35,780
Yes...

1172
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,400
Just follow the path...

1173
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,380
And we might see...

1174
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,640
Some fun things along the way...

1175
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,920
We're just gonna run there...

1176
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,520
I know...

1177
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,320
I know...

1178
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,400
I know...

1179
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,920
I can fast travel...

1180
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,640
But I like running...

1181
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,920
I like seeing all the sights...

1182
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,780
And all the...

1183
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,880
Sorry, I'm lagging...

1184
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,240
Even...

1185
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,000
Why was I not lagging last time...

1186
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And I'm lagging this time?

1187
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,280
Is that guy a friend or...

1188
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,040
Oh...

1189
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,720
Absolutely not...

1190
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,760
Hmm...

1191
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,520
I think maybe I was...

1192
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,000
Because of the settings I changed...

1193
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Maybe that's why I'm lagging...

1194
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,040
I'll take that...

1195
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,220
And I'll take my arrow back...

1196
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,720
I guess I will...

1197
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,220
Wait a second...

1198
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,500
No, nevermind...

1199
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,000
Dagger is nothing...

1200
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,630
Cursed mine...

1201
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,150
We could level up in here...

1202
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,390
Probably...

1203
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,470
Nice shootin'...

1204
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,790
Rootin' tootin'...

1205
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,490
You can level now...

1206
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,210
Oh, that's right!

1207
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,590
I can level up because of the...

1208
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,690
Thing in the corner...

1209
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,150
Maybe we can sleep in here...

1210
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,140
Abandon...

1211
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,700
Steal arrow...

1212
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,420
Oh, that's mine...

1213
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,580
I'm so stupid...

1214
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,640
How do you do...

1215
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,400
I'm hearing...

1216
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,540
Someone's talking...

1217
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,320
She's just...

1218
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,540
They're like...

1219
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,900
Oh, they're in there...

1220
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:34,120
Oh!

1221
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,100
Oh!

1222
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,600
Oh!

1223
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,540
You got this...

1224
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:40,740
Stupid...

1225
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,940
Stupid doesn't know how to open the door...

1226
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,660
Just push it!

1227
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,800
I was trying to listen to their conversation...

1228
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:47,960
What?

1229
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,360
Was I not sneaky enough?

1230
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,940
Can I get you through the door?

1231
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,940
Dang...

1232
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,010
That's a shame...

1233
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,520
Uh...

1234
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,940
I don't wanna open it...

1235
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,020
But...

1236
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:01,360
Um...

1237
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,940
Let me try here...

1238
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,620
Perfect!

1239
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,200
Oh, shoot...

1240
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:11,420
Oh...

1241
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:12,820
You're good...

1242
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,940
You got this...

1243
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:16,780
What the...

1244
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,090
My aim is terrible...

1245
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,940
Take my arrows back...

1246
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,330
Thread the needle...

1247
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,560
Thread the needle...

1248
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,700
Swing my sword...

1249
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,560
Let's try it...

1250
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,580
Jump on my sword while you can...

1251
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,320
Wait...

1252
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:37,780
Is this...

1253
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,260
Is that on her?

1254
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,420
Or is that the door?

1255
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,220
Uh-oh, wait...

1256
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:42,700
I don't know...

1257
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,540
Actually...

1258
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,080
Wait...

1259
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,900
That's the door!

1260
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:45,920
No?

1261
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,840
Try in first person...

1262
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,760
Oh, true, right?

1263
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,930
I don't know if it'll make a difference...

1264
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:56,750
Let's try...

1265
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:58,810
Hmm...

1266
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,310
I'm leaving...

1267
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,180
Is that ET?

1268
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,660
Who's at...

1269
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,560
Depends who's asking...

1270
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,480
How does shooting through the gap even work?

1271
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,960
Oh, there's a dog here!

1272
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,900
Oh my god...

1273
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,340
I hope to be your friend...

1274
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:31,410
If only Glarther thought bandits were stalking him...

1275
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,010
I know, right?

1276
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,510
I also found Ayami's new book...

1277
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:34,830
Yes!

1278
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:36,970
You know what's so funny?

1279
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:38,870
I still haven't even seen that book...

1280
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:39,190
So...

1281
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,090
We'll come back...

1282
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,610
And let's go sleep somewhere...

1283
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:43,630
So that I can level up...

1284
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:48,350
Pet the good boy...

1285
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,690
I think he was after me...

1286
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:50,810
I don't think he was a good boy...

1287
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,270
Okay...

1288
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:54,670
Okay...

1289
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:55,710
It's loading...

1290
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,670
And so...

1291
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,910
I too...

1292
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,170
Am loading...

1293
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,930
I will be a little...

1294
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:05,090
You need a hand, buddy...

1295
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,990
I think I go this way...

1296
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:12,770
Yes...

1297
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,090
Three frame minto...

1298
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,550
What's that over there?

1299
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,770
It's glowing...

1300
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,710
Oh my gosh!

1301
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:23,890
Ouch!

1302
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,170
Oh my god!

1303
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,130
I'm getting ambushed?

1304
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:27,490
Right now?

1305
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:28,450
Uh...

1306
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,010
Uh-oh...

1307
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:29,370
Uh-oh...

1308
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:29,990
Uh-oh...

1309
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,930
Wait, this is bad...

1310
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,190
This is bad, bad...

1311
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,050
This is bad, bad...

1312
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:37,870
How did I miss?

1313
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:38,750
Wait!

1314
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,450
How am I missing?

1315
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,550
This is...

1316
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:40,710
What?

1317
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,910
There we go...

1318
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:46,470
Ouchah!

1319
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,370
Ouchah!

1320
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:54,590
Third person's whack?

1321
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,430
Okay...

1322
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:55,770
Maybe...

1323
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,590
Oh my gosh...

1324
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:59,590
Okay...

1325
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,950
Maybe I start fighting in...

1326
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:02,530
In...

1327
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:02,810
What the?

1328
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,810
This is better than mine?

1329
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,850
Maybe I start fighting in...

1330
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:07,730
First person...

1331
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,690
I didn't realize that a person was over... Oh, Steel.

1332
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:10,530
No.

1333
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,630
They came out and they came after me!

1334
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,330
You sons of bitches.

1335
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,470
Yeah, Steel is better.

1336
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:26,030
Where'd that other guy go that I killed?

1337
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:26,930
I think he's over here.

1338
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,910
Sorry, I just like the third person so much.

1339
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,630
But for combat, I can switch.

1340
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:37,790
Is that him?

1341
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,290
No, that's a rock.

1342
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:44,070
Oh my gosh, I'm five frames per second.

1343
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,010
It's fine, as long as the game looks good.

1344
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,750
Is the game lagging for you guys?

1345
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,810
I don't mind if I lag as long as the game looks good.

1346
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,650
The game looks good?

1347
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:00,010
Okay.

1348
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,150
Don't mind me then, it's fine.

1349
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:04,650
It's just...

1350
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,950
Being a VTuber is hefty hefty.

1351
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,450
Where is he?

1352
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,550
I don't know where I killed him.

1353
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:13,530
I killed a man and I can't even remember where.

1354
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,890
Oh well.

1355
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,280
It was...

1356
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,820
Oh, wait, there he is.

1357
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,680
He was here the whole time.

1358
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,420
Should I take the dagger?

1359
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,960
I feel like I could probably buy a better one.

1360
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,350
Hefty hefty hefty.

1361
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,490
Buy a better one?

1362
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:43,770
Yeah.

1363
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,090
Hefty hefty hefty.

1364
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:49,450
What's this?

1365
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:49,910
Oh.

1366
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,930
You draw power from the well.

1367
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,170
Okay, I could have used that, maybe.

1368
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:59,230
Five seconds ago.

1369
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:02,830
That's not a friend either, probably.

1370
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,410
Why is everybody hate...

1371
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,890
Why is everybody camp and hate me?

1372
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,740
Stop running.

1373
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,900
I can't aim with you, doing that.

1374
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,140
Oh my gosh.

1375
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,040
Oh my gosh, you're a wizard.

1376
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,880
You're a wizard bandit.

1377
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:19,980
Oh, shoot.

1378
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,620
That's right.

1379
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:23,760
Oh!

1380
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,280
Oh!

1381
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,800
Oh my god, he seems so close though.

1382
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,060
You're scaring me!

1383
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,060
You're scaring me!

1384
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,440
Did you just parry that?

1385
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,640
Take them all.

1386
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,020
Ugh.

1387
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,980
You all right, Etina?

1388
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,520
Everybody's out to get you all the time.

1389
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,090
Fat Ramp Camp.

1390
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,750
Fat Ramp Camp.

1391
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,990
I could sleep here.

1392
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:07,390
Let's try it.

1393
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:10,530
We'll sleep for one hour.

1394
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,590
Honk shu.

1395
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,210
And we've reached level three!

1396
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:16,970
Okay.

1397
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,070
Let's see.

1398
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,580
Let's see.

1399
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,040
What's the stuff that's good for...

1400
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,760
A...

1401
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,800
Stealth again.

1402
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,160
More agility.

1403
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,200
Oh, I can do plus five.

1404
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,540
Agility will help with bow and dagger damage.

1405
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,280
Perfect.

1406
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:38,940
Okay, yeah.

1407
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,060
Agility, agility.

1408
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:40,820
Agility.

1409
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,020
I'll even do some more speed.

1410
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,560
What's willpower do again?

1411
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,900
I wish I could read it.

1412
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,840
Oh, show details.

1413
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,260
Magicka.

1414
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,020
We don't need that.

1415
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,440
Magicka.

1416
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:54,340
Maximum health?

1417
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,240
That might be good too.

1418
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,280
Wait, I can't do any more?

1419
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,620
I can only pick three things.

1420
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:09,290
Okay.

1421
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:13,330
Oh, this also is a maximum.

1422
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,190
So maybe we'll do the endurance instead.

1423
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,780
Well, if I can only...

1424
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,460
Oh, okay.

1425
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,620
That might be good.

1426
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,520
Strength lets you carry more loot.

1427
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,700
More loot is good.

1428
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:38,940
No.

1429
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,260
Strength is better earlier IMO.

1430
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,790
Drop speed.

1431
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,510
Wait, so maybe we do strength.

1432
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,470
Oops.

1433
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:58,770
And endurance?

1434
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,090
Like so.

1435
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,330
Let's try that instead.

1436
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,870
That'll give us a lot more HP too.

1437
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:10,530
Okay.

1438
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,310
Back to lag.

1439
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:15,810
Okay.

1440
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,570
Thank you, guys.

1441
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,250
Let's continue onwards.

1442
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,760
We're just...

1443
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,500
I don't even know what the...

1444
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,300
Well gave me.

1445
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,260
Wow, what a pretty path.

1446
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,620
Wait, I see the...

1447
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,120
I see the kingdom all the way from here.

1448
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,380
I see some...

1449
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,400
Oh, those are not birds.

1450
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,480
I was gonna say, I see some birds.

1451
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,400
Oh, they're guarding a cave.

1452
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,520
See that?

1453
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,260
Wait.

1454
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,020
Is this like a village or something?

1455
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:57,680
Or...

1456
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,320
Is there a...

1457
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,000
House there?

1458
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,120
Is this like an imp village?

1459
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,760
Ultimate snipe?

1460
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,520
I should've...

1461
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:12,780
Oh God.

1462
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:13,460
Oh wait.

1463
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,280
He's coming.

1464
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,660
Wait, he's taking the pathway?

1465
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,900
He's so kind.

1466
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,500
He's taking the path.

1467
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,140
Hit!

1468
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:23,880
Oh God.

1469
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:24,840
Just...

1470
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,400
Just...

1471
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:25,960
Just...

1472
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,660
I got him.

1473
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,020
Give me my arrows back.

1474
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,900
For now, I want to take back all my steel arrows.

1475
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,740
Look at his tiny little butt.

1476
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,870
He looks like an action figure.

1477
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,750
That other guy didn't even notice.

1478
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,430
Wait, what does...

1479
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,610
What are these houses then?

1480
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,670
I don't know what happened to my other arrow.

1481
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:56,610
So sad.

1482
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,720
He looks like a little action figure.

1483
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,760
Fire light cave.

1484
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,380
Okay.

1485
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,300
Before we...

1486
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:08,400
Alright.

1487
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,620
But, but, but.

1488
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,940
Just like that guys, but.

1489
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,720
We're going...

1490
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:16,940
This way.

1491
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,340
We're following the path.

1492
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,160
This game has so many things to distract you.

1493
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:34,600
I know!

1494
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,980
I don't...

1495
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,800
I...

1496
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,040
I...

1497
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,880
It's not like I dislike the...

1498
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,800
Thought Chibi would have freed up enough resources to not need FSR frame gen.

1499
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,060
If it's too choppy for you, it's fine to turn it back on.

1500
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,040
Oh, the game is fine for me.

1501
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,080
It's really a matter of if you guys are bothered by the Chibi or not.

1502
00:54:59,320 --> 00:54:59,760
Um...

1503
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,060
You know the character...

1504
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,180
Your character looks like a Dark Crystal Gelfling.

1505
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:05,700
Like...

1506
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,500
That movie, Dark Crystal.

1507
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,360
Not at all?

1508
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,480
Okay, that's fine.

1509
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:14,700
Oh.

1510
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:23,830
Oh, I think I killed him.

1511
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:24,990
What's that?

1512
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:25,370
Oh.

1513
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:26,890
Who's there?

1514
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:31,930
Where?

1515
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,490
Somebody that...

1516
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:35,250
I killed him, but somebody else is here.

1517
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:36,750
What's that?

1518
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:37,690
Nothing.

1519
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,390
Oh, there he is.

1520
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:40,550
Oh, shoot.

1521
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:42,610
Sorry, I killed your friend.

1522
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:43,470
Sorry, I killed your friend.

1523
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,450
Sorry, I killed your friend.

1524
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,080
How much you got?

1525
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:54,840
He's got...

1526
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:56,580
Laced...

1527
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,680
I'm sorry, what do these look like on you?

1528
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,620
The laced...

1529
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:00,380
The laced...

1530
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:00,440
Oh.

1531
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,280
They're not lacy at all.

1532
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:02,780
Wait.

1533
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,000
I like the...

1534
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,200
The cheetah pattern.

1535
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,780
I'm a big fan.

1536
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,620
What do you got?

1537
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,100
Lockpick.

1538
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:13,740
I'll take that.

1539
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,020
Weak poison.

1540
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:20,440
So, I got to figure out how to make...

1541
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,120
Um...

1542
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,420
How to make poison arrows, then.

1543
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,240
We'll take it.

1544
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,940
Brief history of the empire.

1545
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,400
Nine pages!

1546
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,140
Oh my gosh, no way I leveled up again.

1547
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,120
Oh my gosh, no way I leveled up again.

1548
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,340
Woohoo!

1549
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,920
Mucho texto.

1550
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,820
Buff toga feed!

1551
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,760
Thank you so much for the five gifted!

1552
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,600
Thank you.

1553
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,860
I found a book earlier that had 67 pages!

1554
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,900
I adored Chibimito, something about her character Popsicle energy that pumps my brain with good vibes.

1555
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,920
I felt like this game was good.

1556
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,360
But even if I have to use a Chibimito for this game, I felt like...

1557
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,120
The game is goofy enough that it suits...

1558
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,820
That it fits the vibe.

1559
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,140
OMG, you're ET.

1560
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,240
Yeah, I'm ET-ing.

1561
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:27,380
Nah.

1562
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,820
Let's see.

1563
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,460
What should we...

1564
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,020
Should we do the same as before?

1565
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:36,640
Agility.

1566
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:37,820
Max.

1567
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,700
Speed.

1568
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:40,700
No, not speed.

1569
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,660
Endurance.

1570
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,580
And strength.

1571
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,280
Maybe.

1572
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,520
Would be good again.

1573
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,110
Let's do it.

1574
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,430
We slept an hour.

1575
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,910
I don't think there was anything else around here.

1576
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,140
Okay.

1577
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,940
Chibimito's head is kind of shaped like ET-na's.

1578
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:22,660
Oh!

1579
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,500
Who killed that dog?

1580
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:29,860
It wasn't me, was it?

1581
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:30,820
Last time.

1582
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,040
Actually, I don't remember.

1583
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,700
Was it me?

1584
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,520
Free kill.

1585
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,660
Hello, sir.

1586
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,440
I must stash you a question.

1587
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,860
He's ignoring me.

1588
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,920
My horse is gonna be over here.

1589
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,760
That's not my horse.

1590
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,500
My horse...

1591
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,980
We're gonna get up to the gates of Kvatch and we're gonna say...

1592
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,240
That's my horse!

1593
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,260
It's right there!

1594
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,840
Why did I go to jail again?

1595
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,460
Oh, I think because I was already...

1596
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,460
I was a bad girl.

1597
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,760
Oops.

1598
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,300
That was a bad shot.

1599
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,070
Oh my gosh.

1600
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:18,610
Fast.

1601
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:19,330
Fast.

1602
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:20,290
Oh, fast.

1603
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:21,230
Fast dog.

1604
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:21,630
Fast.

1605
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:23,250
Oh!

1606
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:23,910
Oh!

1607
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:25,270
Dog is fast.

1608
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,670
There we go.

1609
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:26,870
Don't.

1610
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:34,380
You stole a horse and killed a guard.

1611
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,420
I borrowed...

1612
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,300
I borrowed...

1613
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,820
...a horse...

1614
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,660
...and killed a guard after he mistook my intentions.

1615
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,960
But it was self-defense.

1616
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,220
Okay, Kvatch is...

1617
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,520
Wait, is that a guy over there too?

1618
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,320
Oh, I see.

1619
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:58,600
Oh!

1620
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,180
I just saw someone running over there!

1621
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:05,430
Um...

1622
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:08,650
I saw...

1623
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:09,590
...a...

1624
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:10,930
This...

1625
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:11,490
Or rather...

1626
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:11,630
Wait.

1627
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,170
We...

1628
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,130
...came here because...

1629
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:21,950
Why am I here again?

1630
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:30,550
The priest...

1631
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:32,510
...in the chapel of Akatosh.

1632
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,220
Yeah, I get sniped, bozo.

1633
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:49,250
Thank you!

1634
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,150
Even the notives are...

1635
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:54,730
There it is.

1636
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:59,310
Why isn't the guard doing anything about these guys, huh?

1637
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,350
I saw somebody running over there.

1638
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:02,750
I did!

1639
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,370
I saw someone running around.

1640
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:19,710
You think there's a guy here?

1641
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,730
There's so many camps.

1642
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,280
Oh, I see him.

1643
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:33,640
Who saw me?

1644
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:35,900
Oh.

1645
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,300
Huh?

1646
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:38,920
Huh?

1647
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,160
What do you mean, huh?

1648
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:48,730
Huh?

1649
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,150
Where are you?

1650
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:56,510
Huh.

1651
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:58,590
So silly.

1652
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:00,990
This stupid bandit.

1653
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:02,750
We're all stupid.

1654
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:03,990
What you got?

1655
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,370
Just some wolf pelt?

1656
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:06,270
Come on!

1657
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:10,590
If you're gonna be a bandit, at least be good at your job.

1658
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:13,250
Why aren't you doing anything about these bandits?

1659
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,250
Why aren't they doing anything?

1660
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:18,230
There's bandits everywhere.

1661
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,250
I'm the one cleaning up the streets here.

1662
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:30,770
Best way to make gold, I found, is to go north...

1663
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:44,770
Go to north of Anvil and...

1664
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:46,090
Here, I'll read that later.

1665
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,870
Actually, if you could...

1666
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:49,330
If you could leave that as a comment...

1667
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:52,390
After stream, that would be so helpful.

1668
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,210
The horse is back!

1669
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:57,790
We're so back, baby.

1670
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:02,210
We are so back, baby.

1671
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,200
Did I even make it to the city before?

1672
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,240
I don't think I did.

1673
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,220
Oh...

1674
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:11,800
Okay, hold on.

1675
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,700
Give me a second, you guys.

1676
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,300
I'm gonna change the...

1677
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,480
Graphics back.

1678
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,680
To what I had them last time.

1679
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,960
What I tried before...

1680
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:23,640
Unfortunately...

1681
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,580
Is not working out.

1682
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,060
That's okay.

1683
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,240
That should be...

1684
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,100
That should...

1685
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,040
Uh-huh.

1686
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:52,620
See?

1687
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,380
So, sorry if the graphics are not as great.

1688
01:03:59,080 --> 01:03:59,560
But...

1689
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,760
For the sake of it just lagging less in general...

1690
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,720
I think it would be better.

1691
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:04,860
As I...

1692
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:05,600
As it lags.

1693
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,660
But also, there's gotta be some times that it loads in, you know?

1694
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,220
Glaim all the plants for the frames.

1695
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,900
We should burn down...

1696
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,460
We should burn down the forest.

1697
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:23,740
Is this a house?

1698
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,860
A sec...

1699
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,100
More.

1700
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:31,780
Uh...

1701
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,600
More like...

1702
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:32,780
Less.

1703
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,780
There's nothing here.

1704
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:38,140
It's empty.

1705
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,260
Oh, wait.

1706
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:41,240
Oh!

1707
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,140
Oh my gosh.

1708
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,220
There's gonna be so many dungeons.

1709
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,380
We're gonna have to go through a dungeon crawl.

1710
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,100
Oh wait.

1711
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,140
At some point.

1712
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,020
Old wooden door.

1713
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,050
Let's see what's in.

1714
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,510
Let's just...

1715
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:01,930
Let's just see what's in.

1716
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:02,610
Is that guy naked?

1717
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,160
The game just auto-saved.

1718
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:22,940
Oh!

1719
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,560
Oh, it's real spooky in here.

1720
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:27,920
What the...

1721
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,880
Oh, it's a giant rat.

1722
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:36,570
What do you...

1723
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:39,170
What do you mean one times damage?

1724
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,360
Rat.

1725
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,420
Why is the rat carrying gold?

1726
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,380
I've...

1727
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,200
I judged you, rat.

1728
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,720
I judged you.

1729
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,120
I misjudged you, rat.

1730
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,120
This place is spooky scary.

1731
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:09,610
Oh, I think...

1732
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:10,050
I...

1733
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:11,830
Thought I heard something, but I think it was the fire.

1734
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:15,610
Oh!

1735
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:16,450
Nope.

1736
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:17,270
Definitely heard something.

1737
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:18,330
What was that?

1738
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:24,720
Okay.

1739
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,200
Very...

1740
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,520
Very sneaky of you.

1741
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,360
Eat, Tina.

1742
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,820
He eats coins.

1743
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,720
What is in here?

1744
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,860
I will...

1745
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,520
Wait.

1746
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,720
I will...

1747
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,340
Save.

1748
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,380
New safe.

1749
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,440
What am I hearing?

1750
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,060
What am I hearing?

1751
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,820
Oh my gosh.

1752
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:07,860
First person, please.

1753
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:15,890
What is that?

1754
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:17,210
That's not your tummy!

1755
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,250
Oh!

1756
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,790
Sounds like footsteps, but I...

1757
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,240
I don't like it!

1758
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,520
Let's go this way.

1759
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:40,900
Yeah, we're so close!

1760
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,380
I think this is just up here.

1761
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:51,650
Maybe I see it from here.

1762
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:54,650
It sounds like...

1763
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,360
I can't tell if they're footsteps or like...

1764
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,450
Like a...

1765
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:02,790
Something like banging at a door, you know?

1766
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:07,950
Oh!

1767
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:09,330
So scary!

1768
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,670
I'm scared.

1769
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,570
I'm not brave at all.

1770
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:13,590
I'm scared.

1771
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:15,750
I'm scared.

1772
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,250
I'm not being brave.

1773
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:18,350
I'm being scared.

1774
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:19,350
I'm being scaredy cat.

1775
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,490
Is that a trap or...

1776
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:30,330
Uh...

1777
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:32,230
Yes.

1778
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:35,550
There's a person!

1779
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:36,750
Oh my god.

1780
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,030
There's only just people in here.

1781
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,130
That's way less scary.

1782
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:03,410
It's an invisible wall?!

1783
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:06,270
No kidding.

1784
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,000
Um...

1785
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,780
Where are all my arrows at?

1786
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:14,940
That I wasted?

1787
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,660
Okay, let's try again.

1788
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,380
Oh!

1789
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:28,940
Wait, I did kill them, right?

1790
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,720
My arrows?

1791
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,700
My arrows?

1792
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:44,910
Look, he's just sleeping.

1793
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:53,550
The floor ate them.

1794
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:57,450
How unfortunate.

1795
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,280
Mail bodge.

1796
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,120
Ew.

1797
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,500
I'm still sneaking through?

1798
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,620
I'm still sneaking around?

1799
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,040
Okay.

1800
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,580
So if I hit this...

1801
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,680
Will these hurt me?

1802
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,060
No.

1803
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,260
Ugh.

1804
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,060
You're stupid traps.

1805
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,560
Oh my gosh.

1806
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,000
Oh shoot.

1807
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:38,180
Oh!

1808
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:38,920
There's many!

1809
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,200
Oh!

1810
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:40,700
There's many!

1811
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,140
Oh my gosh.

1812
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:42,700
Wait, I'm trapped.

1813
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:44,580
Uh...

1814
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,040
Yeah.

1815
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:46,900
Take you down.

1816
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,920
Yeah, take you down.

1817
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:49,540
Ooh!

1818
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,220
Ouch!

1819
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,900
No, you will know pain.

1820
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:55,680
Oh shoot.

1821
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:58,280
You will know pain.

1822
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,680
Give me my arrows back.

1823
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,760
Why don't you guys have any...

1824
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,120
What's a Marauder?

1825
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,580
Why don't you guys carry any loot?

1826
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:17,070
I know I got the wall at one point.

1827
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:20,910
Iron Claymore.

1828
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:23,230
This...

1829
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:23,630
It's...

1830
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:24,610
It's a bandit basically.

1831
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:25,230
Oh.

1832
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:27,950
They just got a fancy name.

1833
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:30,710
I don't need iron arrows.

1834
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:33,190
I don't need your stinky arrows.

1835
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,290
Your lesser arrows.

1836
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:40,710
Ugh.

1837
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:48,110
Surely, if anyone else was in here, they would have heard all the commotion though.

1838
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,880
Tier 2 bandit.

1839
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,180
Uh...

1840
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:56,520
Not at all.

1841
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,260
Not at all though.

1842
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,060
Because they're...

1843
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:06,460
There's...

1844
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:06,620
Oh!

1845
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,180
They got 14 gold!

1846
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:08,640
Okay.

1847
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:09,980
Okay.

1848
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:10,780
Okay.

1849
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,720
Okay.

1850
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,180
I see her again.

1851
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:16,840
Hehehehe.

1852
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,280
Okay.

1853
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:19,880
Okay.

1854
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,300
14 gold.

1855
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,400
Sounds like a win to me.

1856
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,200
Average.

1857
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,540
Average.

1858
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:34,900
Average, eh?

1859
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,640
I can't tell if I'm getting better or if like...

1860
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,580
Because I'm leveling up.

1861
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,440
That's increasing...

1862
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:52,220
The easiness.

1863
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:53,120
You know?

1864
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,900
The tombs!

1865
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:02,590
Both, I believe.

1866
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:03,490
Oh, okay, okay.

1867
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:05,830
The levels make it easy.

1868
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,600
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1869
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:13,780
Oh!

1870
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:15,420
Ah!

1871
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1872
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,220
Urgh!

1873
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:23,740
Ah!

1874
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:27,640
There are skellies in here.

1875
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:42,670
Why am I going through this?

1876
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:44,550
Why am I in here?

1877
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,510
Why am I going through this?

1878
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:48,690
Why did...

1879
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,530
I said I did not want to go...

1880
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:50,630
What?

1881
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:54,770
Well, that sounded like someone's tummy.

1882
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:59,290
I said I didn't want to go through a cavern.

1883
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,290
Here I am.

1884
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:02,370
For fun.

1885
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,630
Okay, let's try and get him again.

1886
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:10,600
Oh!

1887
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,120
Come on.

1888
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:14,500
Guy!

1889
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,520
I hear the skelly.

1890
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,040
I hear him.

1891
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,740
Can you come back?

1892
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,320
Potential loot.

1893
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:29,380
Shoken desu.

1894
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:30,460
Arigatou gozaimasu!

1895
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,540
Zuppa-chan, arigatou gozaimasu!

1896
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,940
Come back, please.

1897
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,240
Can I activate the gate but not shumairo?

1898
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,060
The gate is opened elsewhere.

1899
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:51,580
Oh, okay.

1900
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:00,940
Very good.

1901
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,500
Nobody heard that.

1902
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:03,840
I guess.

1903
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,940
I hear everything.

1904
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,160
Wait, I think that's a skelly.

1905
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,400
All the way- Do you see that?

1906
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:12,780
Do you see that shadow?

1907
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:15,980
I wonder...

1908
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:18,880
If I could like, do the best aim ever.

1909
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:22,980
Oh, that totally would have hit him, but you know.

1910
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,900
The game hates me.

1911
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,760
It's a bone, ma'am.

1912
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:34,200
No, it's a zombie!

1913
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,020
It's a zombie!

1914
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,540
I see another one, I think.

1915
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,260
Yeah, yeah.

1916
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,320
Oh, even scarier.

1917
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,300
Shup!

1918
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:52,280
Oops.

1919
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:54,360
A little too high.

1920
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:56,980
Shup!

1921
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,940
We doing stealth, archer?

1922
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,420
It's all I know.

1923
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,460
He's got some gold on him, though.

1924
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,140
He didn't die poor.

1925
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,480
Hehehehe.

1926
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:17,280
What is this?

1927
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,320
A coffin?

1928
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,920
It's so creepy in here.

1929
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,380
I don't like the whispers.

1930
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:32,260
I don't like all the whispers and the bugs.

1931
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:37,130
Hot dog!

1932
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:38,990
15 gold!

1933
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,420
What whispers?

1934
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,220
Don't say that!

1935
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:46,540
Got it!

1936
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,800
18 gold!

1937
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,060
We're grave robbin'.

1938
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:01,600
Hehehehe.

1939
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,440
He he he.

1940
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,820
They're not gonna miss it.

1941
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:06,460
Except, don't grave rob me.

1942
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,760
Cause, uh...

1943
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,660
I would miss mine.

1944
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,440
I do need it.

1945
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,640
What is it?

1946
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:15,460
F5 is a quick save, right?

1947
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:16,800
F5?

1948
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:22,170
Yes.

1949
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:23,830
Thank you.

1950
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:25,690
I didn't want to accidentally quick load.

1951
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:26,950
That would have been unfortunate.

1952
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:27,990
Hehehehe.

1953
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:31,070
I wonder where that bandit is.

1954
01:17:31,170 --> 01:17:31,650
Is this him?

1955
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:32,530
Wait.

1956
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:34,350
Hehehehe.

1957
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:37,620
Hehehehe.

1958
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:37,860
Hehehehe.

1959
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,360
Oh, stupid.

1960
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:42,780
Hehehehe.

1961
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,200
Okay, let's go.

1962
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,560
He, like, went down this way and then disappeared.

1963
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,180
Oh!

1964
01:17:59,360 --> 01:17:59,800
Nevermind.

1965
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:00,800
He did not disappear!

1966
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,480
What are you still doing here?

1967
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,260
All your friends are dead.

1968
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,180
Okay.

1969
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,200
One shot, baby.

1970
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,480
Oh, I could've.

1971
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,980
I could've taken them down from here.

1972
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,960
Well, maybe we can take them down from here.

1973
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:34,740
Right?

1974
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:35,040
One giant rat.

1975
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,020
Oh.

1976
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,260
Another giant rat.

1977
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,380
I like how I only do one time damage.

1978
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,640
No, don't move.

1979
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,180
I don't see any zombies.

1980
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:52,560
Okay.

1981
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:02,210
Rat.

1982
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,590
Big ol' rat.

1983
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:08,910
This place doesn't seem so big.

1984
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:09,990
Or...

1985
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:11,470
Maybe I'm crazy.

1986
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:12,870
I feel like we...

1987
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:14,250
We went into the tomb.

1988
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:15,990
Um...

1989
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:16,650
We're re...

1990
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:18,190
I don't see any other doors.

1991
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,970
More gold, though.

1992
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:24,670
I will take all the gold.

1993
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:27,110
I will take all the gold.

1994
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:29,350
More steel arrows!

1995
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:43,280
Is Mint's grave mostly filled with checkies and snake figures?

1996
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,680
Who's it to you?

1997
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:48,740
Who's asking?

1998
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,100
Uh...

1999
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:50,420
If...

2000
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:52,860
If it is, um...

2001
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:54,560
It's...

2002
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,740
It's filled with...

2003
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,540
None of those things.

2004
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,060
Because those would be really cool.

2005
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:02,080
And then I would have all the grave robbers for real.

2006
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,820
Okay, there's really...

2007
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:04,700
Oh wait, I missed a chest.

2008
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,220
Oh my gosh.

2009
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,500
We got that one.

2010
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:10,240
Okay!

2011
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,640
We're done in here.

2012
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,090
Skeleton.

2013
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,630
Steel War Axe.

2014
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:22,990
What...

2015
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:25,430
When you guys play these games, what's your favorite...

2016
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:28,570
What's your favorite...

2017
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:30,830
Weapon to use?

2018
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,400
Oh wait, where did I come from?

2019
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,520
Oh, I remember.

2020
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,720
How do you like to play?

2021
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,000
Bow and magic.

2022
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,940
Maybe I should start learning magic.

2023
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:50,400
Magic.

2024
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,440
Magic and melee.

2025
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,400
Stealth Archer.

2026
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:54,720
So like me.

2027
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,440
Bow and dagger.

2028
01:20:58,680 --> 01:20:59,280
Oh!

2029
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:00,800
I was about to be like...

2030
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,680
Oh my gosh!

2031
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:02,760
This guy!

2032
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,320
No, we killed him.

2033
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,640
Did I go through here?

2034
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:09,100
No.

2035
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,560
Magic is super OP and oblivion.

2036
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:25,990
Maybe I should learn more magic then.

2037
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:26,010
Maybe I should learn more magic then.

2038
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,030
But I've put like...

2039
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:33,290
I've put like no...

2040
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,830
Points towards it.

2041
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:43,960
Whoa!

2042
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,020
Was this the room?

2043
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:49,360
No.

2044
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,300
This is a different room.

2045
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:52,200
Hmm.

2046
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:55,900
Where'd my bow go?

2047
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:56,900
I mean my arrow go.

2048
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:00,340
Lost.

2049
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:01,980
Lost forever.

2050
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:05,880
Some basic spells.

2051
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,220
How do you do magic?

2052
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,520
Is it like pressing...

2053
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,040
Is it like pressing...

2054
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,060
1, 2, 3?

2055
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,440
On the keyboard?

2056
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,080
Or...

2057
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,820
Wait, am I going back upstairs?

2058
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:18,140
Where the heck am I?

2059
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:22,160
I'm lost.

2060
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:23,820
Oh!

2061
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,020
I went in a circle!

2062
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,060
I see.

2063
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:28,680
I see.

2064
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,000
I see.

2065
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:31,080
I know we haven't finished...

2066
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:32,660
I don't like that.

2067
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:35,440
I know we haven't finished this area, but...

2068
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,840
I think I want to get to...

2069
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,800
The city now.

2070
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:42,580
Wait.

2071
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,720
This is the rat I killed.

2072
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:45,520
Oh.

2073
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,120
So then up here.

2074
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,340
We can come back.

2075
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:56,280
C will cast your equip spells so you can bind spells...

2076
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,780
Or items to the 1, 2, 3, etc keys.

2077
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,000
I see.

2078
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:00,380
Oh!

2079
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,540
I see.

2080
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,860
I see, I see.

2081
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:19,370
Maybe next time we'll learn magic then.

2082
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,250
Next time I play.

2083
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:22,810
I'll focus...

2084
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:26,230
I'll focus on magic next time.

2085
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:30,590
You see?

2086
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:32,270
I...

2087
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:33,970
Shoot.

2088
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,280
Gosh, you guys are a pain in my side.

2089
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,340
Oh.

2090
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,180
I don't have my arrows.

2091
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:44,860
Wait.

2092
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:45,340
There it is.

2093
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,920
At least he's not...

2094
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,940
Touching my horse!

2095
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:50,540
Oh my gosh.

2096
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:55,440
Gosh!

2097
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,840
I got him at point blank range!

2098
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:00,780
He is tough.

2099
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:03,060
Break stuff came on the radio this morning.

2100
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:07,780
I got genuine whiplash when I heard Fred Durr singing and not the code of my ghosty OC.

2101
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,480
Your horse has a lot of enemies.

2102
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,080
I know, melee archer for real.

2103
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:18,740
You okay, horse?

2104
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:19,820
Yeah.

2105
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,240
He's like, I've seen stuff while you were gone.

2106
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,200
I've seen stuff, Mito.

2107
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,900
I killed your friend and you are next.

2108
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,760
You will die in this lovely camp.

2109
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:37,440
Wow.

2110
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:37,940
Wait.

2111
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,840
There's gotta be more guys here, no?

2112
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,680
There's so many...

2113
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:42,380
Tents.

2114
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,980
Nobody else?

2115
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,520
Nobody else?

2116
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:49,500
Nobody?

2117
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,210
There's a big camp, yeah.

2118
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:55,790
Whoa!

2119
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:58,230
You see that?

2120
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:00,590
Wow, what's that over there?

2121
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,150
What's that down there?

2122
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,570
I'm discovering everything.

2123
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:10,450
And also nothing.

2124
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,720
Go touch that.

2125
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:18,360
Yeah?

2126
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:18,940
Yeah?

2127
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,060
You don't have to tell me twice.

2128
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,200
These bandits are so bad at their job.

2129
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,540
They don't...

2130
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:34,760
They don't...

2131
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,700
Band anything.

2132
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,600
Wait, what was that?

2133
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,460
I guess it was the bed.

2134
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,680
They all suck.

2135
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,420
It's a glowy rock.

2136
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,060
Okay, we're going.

2137
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,960
The gold curse.

2138
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,320
California girls.

2139
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:03,520
We're undeniable.

2140
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:09,310
Wait, what is that thing?

2141
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:10,670
It's standing there.

2142
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:14,190
Is that a thing standing there?

2143
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:16,670
Well, maybe not.

2144
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,610
Are there more bandits here?

2145
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:22,490
I thought it was like a tree person, that thing.

2146
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:26,990
You can travel the world.

2147
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:36,870
It's just a leaf.

2148
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:38,650
Jodestone.

2149
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:43,510
The hero's fate is known when the hero's fame has grown.

2150
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:47,030
Everybody is saying I don't have enough.

2151
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:49,110
I'm too lame.

2152
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:51,530
I'm too lame to buy a house.

2153
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:54,450
I'm too lame to touch a stone.

2154
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,900
I moved to California.

2155
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:03,080
I moved to California.

2156
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:03,620
And...

2157
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,020
I can't even...

2158
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,800
Okay, you good ET now?

2159
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:08,820
You good girl?

2160
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:10,780
I moved all the way here.

2161
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:11,940
And what was the point?

2162
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,300
They said no clout.

2163
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:15,480
Yeah, actually.

2164
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:23,860
What?

2165
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,360
What is that?

2166
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,600
Wait, where's my horse?

2167
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,560
Wait, there's so much stuff around.

2168
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:33,600
What the heck?

2169
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,480
There's just a portal to hell.

2170
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:37,260
Wait, horse?

2171
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:39,940
Where's my horse?

2172
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:40,900
Where'd the camp go?

2173
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:41,680
Wait.

2174
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:43,360
Okay.

2175
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:44,380
Okay, we followed that.

2176
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:47,460
It was like from over.

2177
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,340
Wait, that's a dog.

2178
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,330
Aw, man.

2179
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,880
Ah, that's my horse again.

2180
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:08,760
Horse!

2181
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,100
Uh...

2182
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:19,440
I can hear him.

2183
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:20,580
I think that's him.

2184
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:25,240
I don't know where he is.

2185
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:25,860
He's got...

2186
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:26,480
I think he's over here.

2187
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,300
Oh, I see him down there.

2188
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,200
Silly horse.

2189
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,200
Oh!

2190
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:39,880
Hello.

2191
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,560
Were you protecting my horse?

2192
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:43,860
Thank you, sir.

2193
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,520
Oh.

2194
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:47,760
Or you...

2195
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,120
Wait.

2196
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:50,160
Did I do that?

2197
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:53,960
Yes.

2198
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,080
Um, any rumors?

2199
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:58,660
That's right.

2200
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,360
We gotta go there.

2201
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:02,740
Murdered.

2202
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:06,920
Okay.

2203
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,500
What do I do there?

2204
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:14,560
Okay.

2205
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:15,120
So we...

2206
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,240
We did this.

2207
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:19,000
I think this is what I saw from up there.

2208
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:20,020
I was like, oh my gosh.

2209
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:21,500
There's another camp.

2210
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:22,980
But no, it was this one.

2211
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,020
Look at...

2212
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:24,860
What is that?

2213
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:26,660
Oh, no!

2214
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:28,380
Wait, there's another camp.

2215
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:29,140
Okay, hold on.

2216
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:30,600
Let's go kill some more people.

2217
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:32,500
I wanna go to...

2218
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:34,640
Um...

2219
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,640
The place where Grey Fox is at.

2220
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:37,540
Obviously.

2221
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:38,980
Uh-oh.

2222
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,340
Uh...

2223
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,140
Come on!

2224
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:49,880
Run while there's still time!

2225
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,040
He almost killed you!

2226
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:51,600
God still holds the road.

2227
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:54,100
But it's only a matter of time before they're overwhelmed!

2228
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,620
I almost killed you!

2229
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:02,640
I literally just released my button when he came up.

2230
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:02,900
God's blood?

2231
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,380
You don't know, do you?

2232
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:04,840
What?

2233
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,220
Deidre overran Kvatch last night.

2234
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:10,560
There were glowing portals outside the walls.

2235
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:12,740
Gates to oblivion itself.

2236
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,580
There was a huge creature.

2237
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,380
Something out of a nightmare.

2238
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:18,060
Title drop.

2239
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:19,480
Came right over the walls.

2240
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,020
Blasting fire that swarmed around it.

2241
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:23,900
Killing.

2242
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:25,100
Killing.

2243
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,120
The whole city can't be destroyed.

2244
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:28,600
Go and see for yourself.

2245
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,940
Kvatch is a smoking ruin.

2246
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,900
We're all that's left, do you understand me?

2247
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:36,260
Everyone else is dead!

2248
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,380
Sorry, the delivery is too funny.

2249
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:40,420
How did you escape?

2250
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,560
It was Savly and Mattias.

2251
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,240
Some of the other guards helped some of us escape.

2252
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,540
They cut their way out, right through the city gates.

2253
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:51,440
Savly and says they can hold the road.

2254
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:52,340
No.

2255
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:53,140
No!

2256
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,540
I don't believe him!

2257
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:56,460
Nothing can stop them!

2258
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,980
If you'd seen it, you'd know!

2259
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,560
I'm getting out of here before it's too late.

2260
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:03,080
The toad?

2261
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,840
They'll be here any minute, I'm telling you!

2262
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,480
Run when you can!

2263
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,320
That does not match the face.

2264
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,080
Wait, so these are...

2265
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:15,980
Oh, we're in Kvatch.

2266
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,740
No, we're in the Gold Coast.

2267
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,320
Oh, who are you?

2268
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:32,240
Bolden.

2269
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,340
What do you want?

2270
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:36,460
What happened here?

2271
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:37,360
Late at night.

2272
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:41,240
While we were all asleep, the door to oblivion opened.

2273
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,880
Deidre came out and set fire to the town.

2274
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,840
Many people died, but some got out alive.

2275
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:51,420
I didn't murder any refugees.

2276
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,800
They all said bandits.

2277
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,100
You mean the priest.

2278
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,080
I don't think he made it out of the city.

2279
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,200
Very few of us did.

2280
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:57,740
Oh, no.

2281
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,840
But Savly and Mattias might know more.

2282
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,160
He's in charge of the city guard that are defending the camp.

2283
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:03,860
Okay.

2284
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:07,140
You'll find him at the barricade at the top of the road.

2285
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:10,300
He's still trying to hold what's left of the guard together.

2286
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:11,760
Cool.

2287
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,860
Savly and Mattias.

2288
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:19,340
Well, I'm eating some...

2289
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:20,740
Sorry, I'm eating you.

2290
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,480
I'm eating some cashews.

2291
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:29,300
Stop talking.

2292
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,120
I'm just saying, I'm...

2293
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:31,940
Okay.

2294
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,380
I'm going in the tent.

2295
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:44,460
Oh.

2296
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:45,060
Oh.

2297
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:46,540
Oh.

2298
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:46,780
Oh my god.

2299
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:47,820
I thought it was a turnip.

2300
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,080
Weed him.

2301
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,140
We've been hit hard.

2302
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,040
But we'll come back.

2303
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,260
It looks bad.

2304
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,820
It is bad.

2305
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,380
But we're tough.

2306
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:03,700
We'll rebuild.

2307
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,160
The guards have to clear the ruins first.

2308
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,360
That won't be easy.

2309
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,140
But I'll be here.

2310
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,460
This is my town.

2311
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,320
Nothing is driving me out of here.

2312
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:17,680
Weed him, yeah?

2313
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:19,580
Weed him, yeah?

2314
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:20,560
Leave me alone.

2315
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,320
Oh my god.

2316
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:22,280
You know what?

2317
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,180
To be fair, I did wake her up.

2318
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,540
So she has the right to say that.

2319
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:28,720
How do I get out?

2320
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:30,880
Oh, the doors.

2321
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:32,600
Oh, the walls look like doors.

2322
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,780
And the doors look like walls.

2323
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:36,200
Weed him, yeah?

2324
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:41,120
Who's in here?

2325
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,500
So it must be up there.

2326
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:44,940
Wow.

2327
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:45,500
Oh my gosh.

2328
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,120
So that is a portal to Oblivion.

2329
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:50,200
Do we get to go to Oblivion?

2330
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:02,660
Says I can't open the chest, but...

2331
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:03,100
Wait, what's that?

2332
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,160
Oh, just a...

2333
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:06,920
Kvatch shield and sword.

2334
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:07,840
Wait.

2335
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,260
I'm not allowed to take those.

2336
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,540
What if I'm here to help out?

2337
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,000
I could probably...

2338
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,460
I could probably just peek.

2339
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:17,580
See, there's nothing in there that I would want anyway.

2340
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,620
You'll be going to Oblivion a lot.

2341
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,720
Is it like the nether?

2342
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:30,850
Who's in here?

2343
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:33,470
Not good enough to steal.

2344
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:42,030
There was nobody in here, right?

2345
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:45,490
My bad.

2346
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:47,030
What's that?

2347
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:48,130
Fur boots!

2348
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:52,230
Oh, I thought that was a big block of cheese.

2349
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:55,250
Mixed unit tactics.

2350
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:00,290
Codis colonis.

2351
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:10,690
The legions could learn from the unconventional tactics used by the Khajiit in the Five Years' War against Valonwood.

2352
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:12,070
I do my own thing.

2353
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:13,750
I don't need to learn any of your tactics.

2354
01:35:14,430 --> 01:35:14,910
Who are you?

2355
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:15,850
Arth...

2356
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:16,670
Athrelor?

2357
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:17,610
Welcome to Kvatch.

2358
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:20,410
We've had a spot of trouble, as you can see.

2359
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:22,090
But I'm open for business.

2360
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:22,710
Oh!

2361
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:23,950
Oh, oh.

2362
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:25,130
Are you?

2363
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:26,890
I really can't tell you what happened.

2364
01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:28,930
I'm just lucky to be alive.

2365
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:30,490
I was in my basement.

2366
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:32,770
Suddenly there was a lot of noise and heat.

2367
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:33,450
I couldn't tell you what happened.

2368
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:34,190
I stepped outside.

2369
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:34,530
Oh.

2370
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:36,370
The whole town was on fire.

2371
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:36,870
Smoke.

2372
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:37,870
Everywhere.

2373
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:39,730
I ran for the gate.

2374
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:41,250
I got through the gate.

2375
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,670
I kept running through the woods by the light of the fires.

2376
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:44,330
I couldn't tell you what happened.

2377
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:45,990
But here's what happened.

2378
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:48,570
I came back in the morning and Kvatch was gone.

2379
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:49,370
Oh my god.

2380
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:50,350
There was nothing I could do.

2381
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:52,150
I just ran.

2382
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:54,870
If I hadn't, I'd be dead.

2383
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:56,190
Wow.

2384
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:58,170
Wait, why can't I...

2385
01:35:58,170 --> 01:35:59,370
You said you're open for business.

2386
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:00,790
You're not letting me sell to you.

2387
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:01,990
Farewell.

2388
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:02,950
Yep, goodnight.

2389
01:36:03,790 --> 01:36:04,410
Tucks him in.

2390
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:05,510
I'm gonna tuck you in.

2391
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:09,550
Um...

2392
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:10,290
Yep, you're never...

2393
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:11,890
You're never getting that lockpick back, buddy.

2394
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:14,810
Oh, in the daytime!

2395
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:16,230
I see, I see.

2396
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:22,860
What the...

2397
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,520
They took the valuables.

2398
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:26,880
Clearly.

2399
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:28,220
Oh!

2400
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:31,820
Give this lady a proper tent!

2401
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:34,480
She's crawling out.

2402
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:36,960
You picked a bad time to visit Kvatch.

2403
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:41,020
She's so tired she could barely keep her eyes open.

2404
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:42,420
Go look for yourself.

2405
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,320
The town is gone.

2406
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,500
And most of its people.

2407
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:47,340
Wake up, lady.

2408
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:50,280
The Daedra came out of the gate in the middle of the night.

2409
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:52,640
People who fought, died.

2410
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:56,360
People who ran, they at least had a chance.

2411
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,260
Go back to sleep.

2412
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:58,300
Go back to sleep.

2413
01:36:58,340 --> 01:36:59,560
I'm so sorry for disturbing you.

2414
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,020
Bye!

2415
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:01,680
Bye!

2416
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:07,620
Oh, did I go in here?

2417
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,260
Yes.

2418
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:10,200
Alright.

2419
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:10,320
Perfect.

2420
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,480
I believe we've looked through all of these now.

2421
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,920
That one guy really booked it, huh?

2422
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,100
Kvatch is finished.

2423
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:21,980
There's nothing left.

2424
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:23,220
He looks like he's gonna cry!

2425
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:23,700
Oh!

2426
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:24,440
Nevermind.

2427
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:26,680
Oh!

2428
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,320
Hello.

2429
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:27,420
Come on.

2430
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:28,540
I just can't sleep.

2431
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:32,400
I lie down and close my eyes, but I can't stop thinking about it.

2432
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:33,940
What?

2433
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:34,720
What?

2434
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:36,720
I'm just...

2435
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:38,820
A gate opened and Daedra poured out.

2436
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,120
Everybody ran.

2437
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,120
Or they died.

2438
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:45,500
I don't know how the fire started, but it burned Kvatch to the ground.

2439
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,080
Good day.

2440
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,560
Nah, I think it's actually a pretty bad day for you guys.

2441
01:37:58,900 --> 01:37:59,460
Okay.

2442
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,900
Let's go up there and check it out.

2443
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:06,150
Wait!

2444
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:08,430
Hope is gone.

2445
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:10,510
The Imperial line is dead.

2446
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:10,790
No, my eyes!

2447
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:12,030
My eyes!

2448
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:12,630
Oh my god!

2449
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:13,590
Get that out of my face!

2450
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:18,510
The Imperial line is dead.

2451
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:20,570
And the gods have forsaken us.

2452
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,330
Where is our blessing?

2453
01:38:22,810 --> 01:38:24,090
Where is our protection?

2454
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:26,150
Where are our gods?

2455
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:28,530
The enemy triumphs.

2456
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:30,130
And we die alone.

2457
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:32,870
He's trying to... he's trying to take me down with him.

2458
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:35,150
Lord Dagon is the enemy.

2459
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:35,710
Dagon?

2460
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:37,370
He is the Prince of Destruction.

2461
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:40,050
And the Daedra are his servants.

2462
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:42,010
The chapel is cast down.

2463
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:45,890
And the faithful, my friends, all dead.

2464
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:47,290
The enemy has won.

2465
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:49,390
And we are destroyed.

2466
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:50,390
Uh-oh.

2467
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:51,090
What?

2468
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:55,650
He seems to be different than your usual self-proclaimed holy man.

2469
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:57,550
Maybe what he says is true.

2470
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:58,230
Prophet?

2471
01:38:58,410 --> 01:38:58,730
Who is that?

2472
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:00,410
Wait, I'm asking about something I don't even know.

2473
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:02,890
The attack on the chapel develops just the beginning of an assault on the church itself.

2474
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:06,610
Leave me alone!

2475
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:07,730
Okay.

2476
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:11,050
They're so aggressive.

2477
01:39:12,050 --> 01:39:12,530
Whoa.

2478
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:14,250
Okay, let's keep going up.

2479
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:15,490
Wait.

2480
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:17,130
Never mind.

2481
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:19,750
The gold cursed.

2482
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:23,070
Once you party with Minto.

2483
01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:26,970
Are we gonna get attacked by some Daedra?

2484
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:27,930
Let's see.

2485
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:30,450
Everyone's so aggro.

2486
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:31,090
I know.

2487
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:33,630
Whoa!

2488
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:37,350
Oh, it looks kinda yummy.

2489
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,950
Guys, I wish I could eat lava.

2490
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:45,150
I love a burnt...

2491
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:46,430
Marshmallow.

2492
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:47,730
And it's just...

2493
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:49,310
The most...

2494
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:49,550
Whoa!

2495
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:52,510
It's just the most burnt.

2496
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:56,390
What's happening?

2497
01:39:59,510 --> 01:40:00,350
Who are you fighting?

2498
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:00,670
Oh.

2499
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:03,070
Stand back, civilian.

2500
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:03,850
Oh, okay.

2501
01:40:04,010 --> 01:40:05,310
This is no place for you.

2502
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:07,330
Get back to the encampment at once.

2503
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:08,150
Rawr!

2504
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:09,850
Uh, what happened here?

2505
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:11,550
We lost the damned city.

2506
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:12,630
That's what happened!

2507
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:13,090
Okay!

2508
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:14,450
It was too much.

2509
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:15,670
Too fast.

2510
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:17,470
We were overwhelmed.

2511
01:40:18,010 --> 01:40:18,410
Rawr!

2512
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:19,590
Couldn't even get everyone out.

2513
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:21,430
There are still people trapped in there.

2514
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:21,850
Oh no!

2515
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:23,350
Some made it to the chapel.

2516
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:23,910
Oh.

2517
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,890
But others were just...

2518
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:26,530
Run down in the streets.

2519
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:29,830
The Count and his men are still holed up in the castle.

2520
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:33,070
And now we can't even get back into the city to help them.

2521
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:36,890
That damned Oblivion gate blocking the way.

2522
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:38,950
That's inconvenient.

2523
01:40:39,370 --> 01:40:39,930
What do we do now?

2524
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:41,410
The only thing we can do.

2525
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:43,230
We'll try to hold our ground.

2526
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:44,030
That's what.

2527
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:45,490
You are three men here!

2528
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:50,330
If we can't hold this barricade, those beasts could march right down and overrun the encampment.

2529
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:51,290
There's the...

2530
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:51,610
There's...

2531
01:40:52,270 --> 01:40:54,150
How many people were in this city?

2532
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:54,830
And protect the use of civilians that are left.

2533
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,150
It's all I can do now.

2534
01:40:56,590 --> 01:40:58,650
How many people were in this city?

2535
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:02,190
If there's only like five people down there.

2536
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:05,730
And three people guarding up here.

2537
01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:07,150
You want to help?

2538
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:08,990
You're kidding, right?

2539
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:09,630
Hmm.

2540
01:41:10,150 --> 01:41:12,450
If you're serious, maybe I can put you to use.

2541
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:14,590
It'll likely mean your death, though.

2542
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:15,690
City of 20.

2543
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:16,090
Are you sure?

2544
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:19,530
Uh...

2545
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:19,830
Oh.

2546
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:21,750
Oh, quest.

2547
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:22,630
Uh, sure.

2548
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:24,950
I don't know how to close this gate.

2549
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:25,270
But it must be possible.

2550
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:26,850
Don't get your sweatband in a twist.

2551
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:29,890
Because the enemy closed the ones they opened during the initial attack.

2552
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:33,010
You can see the marks on the ground where they were.

2553
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:35,450
With the great gate right in the middle.

2554
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:39,090
I sent men into the gate to see if they could find a way to shut it.

2555
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:41,470
They haven't come back.

2556
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:42,070
Oh.

2557
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:44,830
If you can get in there, find out what happened to them.

2558
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:45,890
I'm just a civilian.

2559
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:47,830
If they're alive, help them finish the job.

2560
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:50,650
If not, see what you can do on your own.

2561
01:41:50,910 --> 01:41:51,350
Okay.

2562
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:53,110
The best I can say is good luck.

2563
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:56,070
If you make it back alive, we'll be waiting for you.

2564
01:41:58,890 --> 01:41:59,330
Martin.

2565
01:41:59,850 --> 01:42:00,790
You mean the priest?

2566
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:01,870
Yeah.

2567
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:06,110
Last I saw him, he was leading a group towards the chapel of Akatosh.

2568
01:42:06,270 --> 01:42:06,490
Okay.

2569
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:09,850
If he's lucky, he's trapped in there with the rest of them.

2570
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:11,110
At least...

2571
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:11,650
We need that man!

2572
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:14,010
No, we're going to the nether!

2573
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:15,650
Are we going in?

2574
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:16,130
Oh my gosh.

2575
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:17,190
My home!

2576
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:19,950
My god damn home in flames!

2577
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:23,550
It kills me that I can't get in there and do something!

2578
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:24,390
Why are we here?

2579
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:26,350
We couldn't have been any less prepared for this.

2580
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:28,210
Seems like they came out of nowhere.

2581
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:30,630
There were just so many of them.

2582
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:33,770
If only I had a way to strike back at the enemy.

2583
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:37,850
But we can't leave the barricade until that oblivion gate is closed.

2584
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:42,070
He had such like...

2585
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:45,210
Played us like a god damn fiddle energy!

2586
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:47,990
Some kind of portal to oblivion.

2587
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:50,130
The enemy used them to attack the city.

2588
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:53,150
They appeared outside the walls and Daedra poured out.

2589
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:54,010
Oh my gosh.

2590
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:55,930
They opened one right in front of the city gates.

2591
01:42:56,410 --> 01:42:59,210
Until that gate is closed, the best I can do is try to hold these barricades.

2592
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:00,410
Every night I can feel my leg.

2593
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:03,490
Cool.

2594
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:04,210
Good luck.

2595
01:43:04,530 --> 01:43:06,230
It's a brave thing you're doing.

2596
01:43:06,650 --> 01:43:08,510
Let's get this over here!

2597
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:09,450
This ends here!

2598
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:10,330
Oh.

2599
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:12,310
They killed it.

2600
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:13,330
Good job, everybody.

2601
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:17,130
A stunted scap?

2602
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:20,210
Oh my gosh.

2603
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:22,450
Will you guys hold them off while I go in?

2604
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:24,070
Oh, wow.

2605
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:24,970
Whoa!

2606
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:26,310
Oh.

2607
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:27,810
Oh, my eyes!

2608
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:29,850
Wait, this place kind of sucks.

2609
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:33,750
Oh, my eyes.

2610
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:34,790
Oh, it burns!

2611
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:37,910
It's like I'm staring directly- Look at you, Tina!

2612
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:40,030
Staring directly into the sun!

2613
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:54,770
Here we go!

2614
01:43:55,690 --> 01:43:56,170
Eeeh!

2615
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:56,390
Oh.

2616
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:06,310
All you gotta do is walk through it.

2617
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:09,090
Oh,

2618
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:23,900
I see a bunch of things around here, though.

2619
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:26,320
Oh, he's scampering.

2620
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,860
Oh, that was way too high.

2621
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:35,200
I saw one over here, too.

2622
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:35,820
Ooh!

2623
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,880
Am I at the wrong place, or...?

2624
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:48,410
I don't even care.

2625
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:49,290
They don't even notice.

2626
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:53,290
I don't even notice.

2627
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:56,050
Just a bit.

2628
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:56,570
Oh.

2629
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:58,190
But, like...

2630
01:44:58,190 --> 01:44:59,830
All I had to do was go inside.

2631
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:00,350
Uh-oh.

2632
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:04,470
All I had to do was go inside!

2633
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:15,770
I'm not breaking anything?

2634
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:16,390
Okay.

2635
01:45:20,150 --> 01:45:22,430
This place is pretty beat up, though.

2636
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:26,470
This must be the Temple of Akatosh, no?

2637
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:31,010
We can go see Martin.

2638
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:33,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2639
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:34,210
The Chapel of Akatosh.

2640
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:35,130
Okay.

2641
01:45:37,530 --> 01:45:38,410
What the...

2642
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:38,790
Oh.

2643
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:41,110
Oh, my God!

2644
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:43,350
We were beginning to fear we were the only survivors.

2645
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:44,870
Yeah, I thought you were gonna draw...

2646
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:46,010
You drew your sword on me!

2647
01:45:46,770 --> 01:45:46,910
It...

2648
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:48,870
It all happened so fast.

2649
01:45:49,290 --> 01:45:53,130
It was all we could do to round up the survivors and try to get them to safety.

2650
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:55,410
We failed them miserably.

2651
01:45:56,530 --> 01:45:56,970
Ah...

2652
01:45:56,970 --> 01:45:57,910
Martin, is he here?

2653
01:45:57,910 --> 01:45:58,590
Brother Martin?

2654
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,110
Yes, he's right over there.

2655
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:03,210
He led a group of us here during the confusion of the attack.

2656
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:05,230
We owe him our lives.

2657
01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:08,390
Be seeing you.

2658
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,560
Over here!

2659
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,600
Oh, I can open these.

2660
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:17,400
What you got in here?

2661
01:46:18,340 --> 01:46:18,920
Food?

2662
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:19,660
Hmm.

2663
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:21,640
Hmm.

2664
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,160
I just can't sleep.

2665
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,800
I lie down and close my eyes, but...

2666
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:27,300
I...

2667
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:28,020
Can't...

2668
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:29,320
Stop thinking about it.

2669
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:30,380
Oh, it's okay.

2670
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:31,240
How did you get in here?

2671
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,820
What are you doing here?

2672
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,620
I'm here for Martin.

2673
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:36,480
Martin?

2674
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:39,820
He's back there, looking after the other survivors.

2675
01:46:42,380 --> 01:46:42,920
Kvatch.

2676
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:44,500
You've seen it.

2677
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,040
Kvatch doesn't exist anymore.

2678
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,600
They're expressions are so funny.

2679
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:51,060
You too.

2680
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:52,200
You too.

2681
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:54,780
I didn't say have a good day.

2682
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:57,900
Repair hammer.

2683
01:46:58,140 --> 01:46:59,440
Actually, how is my bow?

2684
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:00,520
Now that I think about it.

2685
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:03,080
54.

2686
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:06,520
I want to try using a repair hammer on it.

2687
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:08,600
But I'm not.

2688
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:09,220
Oh, let's see.

2689
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,420
Wait, what's this?

2690
01:47:10,940 --> 01:47:11,760
What's that mean?

2691
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:15,480
Enjoy your food.

2692
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,400
You too.

2693
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:20,140
Oh, stolen.

2694
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,760
It means it's stolen?

2695
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:26,220
Wait, if I use it then.

2696
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,620
On my bow.

2697
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:33,440
There we go.

2698
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:34,740
I did it.

2699
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:43,020
Oh, I have so.

2700
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:43,520
One left.

2701
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:46,100
Yay.

2702
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:50,300
Wait.

2703
01:47:58,790 --> 01:48:00,210
They can be used more than once.

2704
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:01,030
Oh.

2705
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:03,130
Oh, I see.

2706
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:03,950
I see how it works.

2707
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:12,790
There it is.

2708
01:48:13,010 --> 01:48:13,770
Oh, okay.

2709
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:14,050
Okay.

2710
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:15,510
Interesting.

2711
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:16,070
Cool.

2712
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:17,310
I learned.

2713
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:17,670
Oh.

2714
01:48:19,310 --> 01:48:21,150
I don't want to activate these just yet.

2715
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:21,630
Unless.

2716
01:48:22,190 --> 01:48:22,890
There's no.

2717
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:25,070
Bad reason for doing so.

2718
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:27,890
Dang.

2719
01:48:28,050 --> 01:48:29,210
I thought we were gonna go here.

2720
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,850
And be like, wow.

2721
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:32,930
This is such a bustling city.

2722
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:36,610
So many great things.

2723
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:37,610
What are tongs for?

2724
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:38,990
Oh, hello.

2725
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:39,010
Hello.

2726
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:40,550
Greetings, traveler.

2727
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:41,930
What do you seek?

2728
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:43,770
Nothing.

2729
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:45,210
You too.

2730
01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:46,670
You too.

2731
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:50,210
Lenka.

2732
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:51,970
I'm sorry.

2733
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:54,190
I don't think I'm gonna be much help.

2734
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:55,750
They're junk.

2735
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:56,170
Oh.

2736
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:56,670
Haha.

2737
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:57,610
Yes.

2738
01:48:57,930 --> 01:48:59,350
I followed the priest here.

2739
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:01,570
I'll be safe here, won't I?

2740
01:49:02,210 --> 01:49:04,410
They can't come on holy ground, can they?

2741
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,290
Yeah.

2742
01:49:08,170 --> 01:49:08,570
Good day.

2743
01:49:08,770 --> 01:49:09,190
Yeah.

2744
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:09,870
Yeah.

2745
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:10,550
Yeah.

2746
01:49:10,990 --> 01:49:11,850
Martin, where'd he go?

2747
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:12,870
Wait, where'd he go?

2748
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:13,990
Oh, there he is.

2749
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:16,210
Have you brought help?

2750
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:19,610
We've been trapped here since the Daedra over around the city.

2751
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:20,770
How long have they been...

2752
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:21,110
Oh, wait.

2753
01:49:21,110 --> 01:49:24,290
How long have they been stuck here?

2754
01:49:24,490 --> 01:49:25,110
Cause like...

2755
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:30,450
Cause...

2756
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:32,130
Cause...

2757
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:33,790
I've just been like...

2758
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:36,450
I've just been looking for my horse and...

2759
01:49:36,790 --> 01:49:38,470
Almost assassinating people.

2760
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:39,890
I was just like...

2761
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:42,350
I was goofing around in...

2762
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:43,090
Skingrad.

2763
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:47,190
And uh...

2764
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:51,690
Who is Sean Bean?

2765
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:53,270
Who's that?

2766
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:54,950
Sean Bond.

2767
01:49:55,610 --> 01:49:56,910
Of course I'm in danger.

2768
01:49:57,210 --> 01:49:58,550
But I'm needed here.

2769
01:49:58,710 --> 01:49:59,450
I can't leave.

2770
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:03,570
I assume you didn't risk your own life to come here to tell me something I already know.

2771
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:05,550
Who are you and what do you want?

2772
01:50:05,930 --> 01:50:06,450
Boromir.

2773
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:08,910
Big actor?

2774
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:11,210
Wait, is that the voice actor or Boromir?

2775
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:13,990
Hold on, I Google?

2776
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:23,540
Hello!

2777
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:27,400
It's this guy!

2778
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:29,640
Wait...

2779
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:32,720
I see it!

2780
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:42,070
This is the...

2781
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:43,810
This is literally that meme guy.

2782
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:45,830
One does not simply...

2783
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:47,830
Uh...

2784
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:49,670
Pickpocket.

2785
01:50:53,190 --> 01:50:54,990
One does not simply...

2786
01:50:56,010 --> 01:50:56,490
Assassinate...

2787
01:50:56,490 --> 01:50:58,270
Twin brothers in the night.

2788
01:51:04,710 --> 01:51:06,370
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2789
01:51:07,170 --> 01:51:08,450
You're Martin, right?

2790
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:09,190
Yes.

2791
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:10,710
I'm a priest.

2792
01:51:11,310 --> 01:51:12,610
Do you need a priest?

2793
01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:14,650
I don't think I'll be much help to you.

2794
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:15,350
It's his voice too?

2795
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:15,990
That's crazy.

2796
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:18,570
I'm having trouble understanding the gods right now.

2797
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:19,570
How did they get such a...

2798
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:21,130
If all this is part of a divine plan.

2799
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:22,250
Star-studded cast.

2800
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:24,810
I'm not sure I want to have anything to do with it.

2801
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:28,730
Hmm...

2802
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:29,390
There's a plan.

2803
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:30,390
We're part of it.

2804
01:51:30,610 --> 01:51:31,190
What plan?

2805
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:32,630
What are you talking about?

2806
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:33,470
Actually...

2807
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:35,130
I don't even know what the plan is.

2808
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:38,690
One does not simply walk into oblivion.

2809
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:39,610
Yeah, I walk through it.

2810
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,950
What do you possibly know that would help me make sense of this?

2811
01:51:42,110 --> 01:51:43,190
Todd the God.

2812
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:44,170
Todd the God.

2813
01:51:45,290 --> 01:51:46,170
Oh, I...

2814
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:48,470
I forgot that this is a Todd Howard game.

2815
01:51:50,990 --> 01:51:51,530
Well...

2816
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:54,070
You are Uriel Septon's son.

2817
01:51:54,410 --> 01:51:55,950
Emperor Uriel Septon.

2818
01:51:56,310 --> 01:51:58,290
You think the Emperor is my father?

2819
01:51:58,410 --> 01:51:59,390
I don't think I know.

2820
01:51:59,390 --> 01:52:00,150
I am a priest of Akatosh.

2821
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:01,710
I am a priest of Akatosh.

2822
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:03,850
My father was a farmer.

2823
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,460
The Emperor knew you were in danger.

2824
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:11,840
You spoke to the Emperor before he died?

2825
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:13,920
And he told you to find me?

2826
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:17,780
Sorry, I'm grabbing more...

2827
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,480
...cattle shoes.

2828
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,460
Why would I lie to you?

2829
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:20,340
I don't know.

2830
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:21,260
It's strange.

2831
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:21,760
I...

2832
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:24,740
I think you might actually be telling the truth.

2833
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:26,200
What does this mean?

2834
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,180
What do you want from me?

2835
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:27,400
I'm a truther.

2836
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:30,980
Come with me to Wayne and Priory.

2837
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:31,560
No.

2838
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:36,140
I'm sorry, but even if what you say is true, I won't abandon these people to their fate.

2839
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:38,860
I'll go with you when we can all leave here together.

2840
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:40,120
I cleared the entrance!

2841
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:43,700
We can all leave!

2842
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,100
I...

2843
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:51,520
I...

2844
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:51,980
I...

2845
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:53,520
Nobody's here anymore!

2846
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:58,580
We have to go through the gate?

2847
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:02,280
No kidding.

2848
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:04,680
Need the key.

2849
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,460
Block cannot be ticked.

2850
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:11,300
Am I stealing from the church?

2851
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:14,440
Maybe.

2852
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:16,520
But...

2853
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,660
But...

2854
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,820
Honestly, I deserve the money.

2855
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:24,520
I'm helping them out.

2856
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:32,470
Call it my...

2857
01:53:33,210 --> 01:53:33,810
My...

2858
01:53:33,810 --> 01:53:34,970
Save the world tax.

2859
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:41,980
Okay, maybe they do need the money.

2860
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:43,760
They can't even afford a bed.

2861
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:46,340
They can't even afford proper beds.

2862
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:47,980
Hmm.

2863
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:50,140
Uh...

2864
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:51,960
I still don't feel guilty though.

2865
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:57,670
Oh, never mind.

2866
01:53:57,670 --> 01:53:57,910
See?

2867
01:53:58,030 --> 01:53:59,290
They have two proper beds.

2868
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:05,230
They're fine.

2869
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:16,610
Oh, I was gonna say I like how just randomly the rain comes through, but...

2870
01:54:16,610 --> 01:54:18,490
There's actually a hole in the ceiling.

2871
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:19,450
That's crazy.

2872
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:22,350
Okay.

2873
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:23,510
I'll go, uh...

2874
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:25,650
Back outside.

2875
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:27,190
If that's what you want me to do.

2876
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:29,530
You're sending me back out there with the demons.

2877
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:31,330
Yeah?

2878
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:32,890
Okay.

2879
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:35,010
No one...

2880
01:54:35,010 --> 01:54:36,530
No one's gonna help or...

2881
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:38,170
Alright.

2882
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:41,530
Let's go into the nether.

2883
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:52,270
I gotta get my arrows back.

2884
01:54:58,510 --> 01:55:00,050
What is this thing?

2885
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:00,490
I...

2886
01:55:00,490 --> 01:55:01,230
What is this?

2887
01:55:03,550 --> 01:55:04,150
How?

2888
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:08,830
Oh my god, it's kinda cute.

2889
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:10,570
It's just a lizard.

2890
01:55:13,170 --> 01:55:14,230
Real dinosaur.

2891
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:17,890
Oh!

2892
01:55:17,890 --> 01:55:18,410
Oh, hi.

2893
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:19,290
That was a nice girl.

2894
01:55:20,190 --> 01:55:21,010
They got gold.

2895
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:25,420
Who else got gold?

2896
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:27,940
I don't know why do people keep gold in their barrels.

2897
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:32,600
The good old days of...

2898
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:34,560
Keeping gold...

2899
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,720
Oh, oh, this is the top of the chapel.

2900
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:37,940
That's crazy.

2901
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:41,780
Wait.

2902
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:45,520
Okay.

2903
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:47,200
To the nether!

2904
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:52,780
You don't...

2905
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:54,240
I keep my gold in my barrels.

2906
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:54,820
That's what I'm saying.

2907
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,460
Not enough people are keeping their gold in their barrels anymore.

2908
01:56:02,490 --> 01:56:02,890
Okay.

2909
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:05,710
Let's go.

2910
01:56:09,610 --> 01:56:10,410
Into oblivion.

2911
01:56:10,570 --> 01:56:12,130
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

2912
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:13,870
My first time here!

2913
01:56:16,030 --> 01:56:17,590
Oh, they already brought...

2914
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:19,230
The hospitality team.

2915
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:20,450
Uh-oh.

2916
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:25,530
Woo!

2917
01:56:27,170 --> 01:56:28,370
In those fire!

2918
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:33,130
Is that a friend or...

2919
01:56:33,130 --> 01:56:34,490
I think that's a friend.

2920
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:35,950
You're human!

2921
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:37,730
What if it was a...

2922
01:56:37,730 --> 01:56:38,670
That's a bandit?

2923
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:39,710
Thank the nine.

2924
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:42,490
I never thought I'd see another friendly face.

2925
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:43,570
The others...

2926
01:56:44,410 --> 01:56:44,930
Taken...

2927
01:56:44,930 --> 01:56:46,630
They were taken to the tower.

2928
01:56:46,810 --> 01:56:48,090
The tower...

2929
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:48,670
It's alright.

2930
01:56:49,010 --> 01:56:49,770
What's going on?

2931
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:52,250
Captain Matthias sent us in to try and close the gate.

2932
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:55,690
We were ambushed, trapped, and picked off.

2933
01:56:55,850 --> 01:56:56,690
How... where were you?

2934
01:56:56,690 --> 01:56:57,370
They managed to escape.

2935
01:56:57,590 --> 01:56:59,410
But the others are strewn across the bridge.

2936
01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:01,630
They took Minion off to the big tower.

2937
01:57:01,850 --> 01:57:02,730
You've got to save him.

2938
01:57:03,210 --> 01:57:04,150
I'm getting out of here.

2939
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:05,970
No, no, no.

2940
01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:06,790
Hold on.

2941
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:07,290
Yeah, yeah.

2942
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:07,870
You're right.

2943
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:08,870
You're right.

2944
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:11,870
I can't just leave poor Minion to his fate.

2945
01:57:12,250 --> 01:57:12,650
Minion.

2946
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:15,010
If he's still alive, we've got to try to save him.

2947
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:15,690
Or I'll be the way.

2948
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:17,230
Yeah, you are gonna abandon your friend.

2949
01:57:19,530 --> 01:57:21,450
Let's find Minion and get out of here.

2950
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:22,030
So true.

2951
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:28,160
Nice.

2952
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:29,660
Okay.

2953
01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:31,020
We're gonna find that guy.

2954
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:33,620
Let me get my arrows back.

2955
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:38,080
My steel arrows.

2956
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,360
They're worth a lot.

2957
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:43,380
Uh...

2958
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:44,620
The bridge?

2959
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:46,960
How do I open it up?

2960
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:49,940
Oh, it's sick.

2961
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,240
I should make this an interactive quest.

2962
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:53,640
You know what?

2963
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:54,100
You're right.

2964
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:57,100
We still have the Paranoid.

2965
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:00,840
Uh...

2966
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,240
Break the siege.

2967
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:05,360
Wait.

2968
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:06,280
No, this one.

2969
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:07,940
Breaking the siege of Kvatch.

2970
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:08,480
There we go.

2971
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:14,460
Where did that guy come from?

2972
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,260
Why are you helping me out?

2973
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:21,780
Where were you hiding?

2974
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:25,900
Any guys over here?

2975
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:26,340
No?

2976
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:31,640
Whoa!

2977
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:34,940
It's a body on fire.

2978
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,680
I'm just taking it all in.

2979
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:39,760
Touch that plant.

2980
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:40,880
What plant?

2981
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:46,600
I don't see any plant.

2982
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:46,840
Hang on.

2983
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:48,460
This plant?

2984
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:49,320
Oh, blood grass.

2985
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:54,300
I don't know if I want to take that.

2986
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:58,840
I don't know if...

2987
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:02,480
Oh, always gather lots of materials in oblivion.

2988
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,420
I've harvested the blood grass.

2989
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:14,470
Nice.

2990
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:15,450
Wait, hold on.

2991
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:17,830
I want to get a good shot of E-Tina here.

2992
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:22,020
Oh, she looks evil!

2993
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:25,750
Oh, no.

2994
01:59:25,890 --> 01:59:26,050
Sorry.

2995
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:28,250
I thought that was a fiery imp behind her.

2996
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:29,510
I feel like...

2997
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:30,710
Tina, behind you!

2998
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:36,730
Evil E-T.

2999
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:41,650
Okay, I'm one in front of the gate, too.

3000
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:41,990
I feel...

3001
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:45,230
Oh, my God!

3002
01:59:45,550 --> 01:59:47,530
Oh, she looks so evil!

3003
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:52,450
Okay.

3004
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:54,610
Across the bridge we go!

3005
01:59:55,370 --> 01:59:56,790
To the bridge we go!

3006
01:59:57,610 --> 01:59:59,270
Across the bridge we go!

3007
02:00:00,650 --> 02:00:01,770
Activate the gate...

3008
02:00:02,370 --> 02:00:03,930
Oh, uh...

3009
02:00:03,930 --> 02:00:04,590
Uh...

3010
02:00:04,590 --> 02:00:06,790
Can I help a ghost out?

3011
02:00:07,590 --> 02:00:09,750
Where is the gate opening?

3012
02:00:10,830 --> 02:00:12,490
How do we open the gate?

3013
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:13,550
Is it this?

3014
02:00:14,670 --> 02:00:15,150
Huh?

3015
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:16,110
Oh!

3016
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:22,060
What the?

3017
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:23,860
How did I miss you?

3018
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:29,340
Wait!

3019
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:30,840
Oh!

3020
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:32,220
Uh, good job!

3021
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:35,820
Good job!

3022
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:45,660
Ooh, Dad.

3023
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:47,620
This is my buddy.

3024
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:49,700
Uh...

3025
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:50,360
Illand.

3026
02:00:52,820 --> 02:00:54,000
Where is the...

3027
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,140
I'm just gonna keep looking...

3028
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:55,920
Wait, what is that?

3029
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:57,880
Is that a...

3030
02:00:58,580 --> 02:00:58,840
Uh...

3031
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:00,600
I don't like the looks of that thing.

3032
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:02,060
I'm gonna shoot it down?

3033
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:05,060
Never mind.

3034
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:06,940
But I see a little...

3035
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:08,860
A little scallywag there.

3036
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:13,100
Oh.

3037
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:14,040
Let's stick together!

3038
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:15,640
Oh my god.

3039
02:01:24,590 --> 02:01:25,710
I don't...

3040
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:26,270
What?

3041
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:28,930
Is it not a...

3042
02:01:28,930 --> 02:01:29,990
Seed?

3043
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:33,890
Oh, the crouch for sneak bonus.

3044
02:01:34,050 --> 02:01:34,550
You're so right!

3045
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:35,450
How could I forget?

3046
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:38,450
You're right, you're right.

3047
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:41,510
Cause that's how I get my three times, baby.

3048
02:01:42,930 --> 02:01:43,610
Ew!

3049
02:01:44,110 --> 02:01:45,710
I'll take the stinky...

3050
02:01:45,710 --> 02:01:46,730
The stinky...

3051
02:01:47,190 --> 02:01:47,530
Grass?

3052
02:01:53,070 --> 02:01:54,130
Oh my gosh!

3053
02:01:54,150 --> 02:01:55,650
All of our friends are over there!

3054
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:56,510
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3055
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:58,350
Touch the sack.

3056
02:01:59,330 --> 02:02:00,130
Fleshy pod!

3057
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:01,870
Oh!

3058
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:09,360
It was actually stacked.

3059
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,460
Can you unsuccessfully...

3060
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:17,320
Harvest things?

3061
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:20,720
The sacks have loot.

3062
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:22,480
Good to know.

3063
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:29,060
L-l-l-lava!

3064
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:40,920
Maybe up in here?

3065
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,040
Oh.

3066
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:48,200
This is not an entrance.

3067
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:50,540
Don't follow me.

3068
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:54,340
Me too.

3069
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:02,340
Guys...

3070
02:03:02,340 --> 02:03:03,080
Am I blind?

3071
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:07,680
Am I blind?

3072
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:09,760
Where is the...

3073
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:12,080
How do you activate the entrance?

3074
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:16,840
How did you guys do it?

3075
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:17,640
I'm gonna ask him.

3076
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:18,260
What's the plan?

3077
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:21,700
Follow me.

3078
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:29,590
Let's go this way, I suppose.

3079
02:03:30,410 --> 02:03:32,930
I wanna go see what that burning body is anyway.

3080
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:36,230
I hear something...

3081
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:38,070
That sounds like...

3082
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:38,870
It's all like...

3083
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:41,970
Oh, what?

3084
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:43,690
Is that it right there?

3085
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:52,310
Just follow the path.

3086
02:03:54,630 --> 02:03:55,330
Oh!

3087
02:04:00,370 --> 02:04:01,350
Are you okay?

3088
02:04:02,590 --> 02:04:03,290
Pickpockets.

3089
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:07,370
Yes!

3090
02:04:07,370 --> 02:04:08,190
Must have been the way...

3091
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:08,650
Wow!

3092
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:12,590
Cirque du Soleil.

3093
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,880
Can I die in the lava?

3094
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:24,260
Oh!

3095
02:04:29,310 --> 02:04:29,920
There we go.

3096
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:30,780
Yes!

3097
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:31,160
Oh!

3098
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:37,640
Oh!

3099
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:37,760
Oh!

3100
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:37,880
Oh!

3101
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:38,100
Oh my god!

3102
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:39,280
Wow!

3103
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:40,020
That was fast!

3104
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:43,320
Yo, Kaitina!

3105
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:47,760
Why is she looking at him like that?

3106
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,040
What?

3107
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:52,140
I think they have chemistry.

3108
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,260
Are you guys seeing it too?

3109
02:04:57,680 --> 02:04:58,920
Look at the way they just...

3110
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:00,900
stare at each other.

3111
02:05:06,350 --> 02:05:07,890
I think they have chemistry.

3112
02:05:10,610 --> 02:05:11,090
Alright.

3113
02:05:12,090 --> 02:05:12,870
Onward.

3114
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:21,140
Another flesh pod.

3115
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:32,420
We're being very sneaky.

3116
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:40,250
We're being very sneaky.

3117
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:46,430
I think I hear something there.

3118
02:05:50,030 --> 02:05:51,710
It sounds like something walking.

3119
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:55,110
Huh?

3120
02:05:57,950 --> 02:05:58,790
What is...

3121
02:05:58,790 --> 02:05:59,330
What is it?

3122
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:04,770
It's gone now.

3123
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:05,390
Did you hear that?

3124
02:06:08,450 --> 02:06:09,550
Oh my god.

3125
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:10,770
Oh my god!

3126
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:12,470
These...

3127
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,800
These stones are made of...

3128
02:06:19,940 --> 02:06:20,580
Of...

3129
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:21,460
Of...

3130
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,300
Foam or something.

3131
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:23,980
Oh shoot.

3132
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:28,680
Is that their idea of a trap?

3133
02:06:28,900 --> 02:06:29,260
Or...

3134
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:29,720
Oh nice.

3135
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:34,660
Oh!

3136
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:35,860
I wasted it!

3137
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:37,040
No!

3138
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:44,750
Shoot the rocks.

3139
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:59,220
Now that arrow is now...

3140
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:00,240
That arrow went...

3141
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:00,560
Oh...

3142
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:01,340
Oh...

3143
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:03,300
It went back through the portal.

3144
02:07:05,740 --> 02:07:07,700
I'll wait for that guy to show back up.

3145
02:07:08,480 --> 02:07:09,720
I'll be able to get him.

3146
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:10,620
I can get him.

3147
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:14,420
Maybe.

3148
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:19,200
Oh!

3149
02:07:19,460 --> 02:07:20,380
Flesh pods.

3150
02:07:26,860 --> 02:07:27,500
Nice.

3151
02:07:30,580 --> 02:07:31,220
Ooh!

3152
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:32,620
Bound boots.

3153
02:07:37,330 --> 02:07:38,410
My speed!

3154
02:07:38,410 --> 02:07:38,650
Oh!

3155
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:40,010
They drained my speed!

3156
02:07:40,430 --> 02:07:40,750
Oh!

3157
02:07:40,890 --> 02:07:41,130
Hello.

3158
02:07:42,510 --> 02:07:45,590
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3159
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:48,720
I still got him.

3160
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:53,140
I thought he said...

3161
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:53,720
Fuck him up!

3162
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:54,380
Fuck!

3163
02:08:02,080 --> 02:08:02,480
Nice.

3164
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:02,760
Nice.

3165
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:13,240
Oh my god!

3166
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:16,300
This place really is the nether.

3167
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:19,000
Watch out.

3168
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,240
Oh my god!

3169
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:23,000
Watch out.

3170
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:23,740
Watch out.

3171
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:25,180
Don't let the trees touch you.

3172
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:27,040
Everything's evil here.

3173
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:29,400
There was a guy up here.

3174
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:30,100
I know there was.

3175
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:31,980
Can I kill these?

3176
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:33,200
Or...

3177
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:35,580
Let's try.

3178
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:37,560
No.

3179
02:08:38,180 --> 02:08:39,900
I think I just lost an arrow.

3180
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:41,700
Okay.

3181
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,680
It was a good experiment.

3182
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:45,160
You can harvest them?

3183
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:46,900
Shut up.

3184
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:47,700
Oh!

3185
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,060
I can't take the whole thing though.

3186
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:54,880
My sneak has increased.

3187
02:09:03,390 --> 02:09:04,190
Looking around.

3188
02:09:04,330 --> 02:09:05,860
Making sure I don't get attacked.

3189
02:09:06,930 --> 02:09:07,150
And...

3190
02:09:08,270 --> 02:09:10,270
The hat looks like it should be like...

3191
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:12,030
Like a secret entrance or something.

3192
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:12,670
You know what I mean?

3193
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:14,550
The hat looks like it's blow...

3194
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:15,470
Like you can blow it up.

3195
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:22,310
I know there was a guy up there.

3196
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:23,650
Wait, what is this?

3197
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:24,430
Nothing.

3198
02:09:25,950 --> 02:09:26,430
Um...

3199
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:27,590
Okay, we're heading the right way.

3200
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:29,670
We are, we are.

3201
02:09:32,450 --> 02:09:33,630
Where are you?

3202
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:34,270
Whoa.

3203
02:09:35,890 --> 02:09:36,990
Oh, where are I...

3204
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:37,930
That's a great question.

3205
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:44,230
But the...

3206
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:46,090
The red arrow goes to here.

3207
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:47,730
So we're just gonna keep going that way.

3208
02:09:52,940 --> 02:09:54,940
Looking around for any...

3209
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:57,100
Critters, creatures.

3210
02:09:58,640 --> 02:09:59,480
Daedra.

3211
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:01,260
As they are called.

3212
02:10:06,350 --> 02:10:07,190
Like...

3213
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:07,610
So.

3214
02:10:08,730 --> 02:10:09,150
Oops.

3215
02:10:09,630 --> 02:10:10,070
Hiya.

3216
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:14,090
I wish I could...

3217
02:10:14,090 --> 02:10:15,910
Maybe if I like put my bow away.

3218
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:21,640
What is that?

3219
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:27,830
What?

3220
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:28,870
Did you...

3221
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:29,490
Where?

3222
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:32,210
It does work?

3223
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:33,270
Oh, okay, okay.

3224
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:35,930
How can you see the land mines?

3225
02:10:36,150 --> 02:10:36,910
Oh my gosh.

3226
02:10:38,110 --> 02:10:40,050
This guy is just casually on fire.

3227
02:10:41,570 --> 02:10:42,050
Nice!

3228
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:57,200
Those mines hurt?

3229
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:57,940
Okay, okay.

3230
02:10:58,480 --> 02:10:58,980
We gotta...

3231
02:10:58,980 --> 02:10:59,700
We gotta be careful.

3232
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:01,960
But look!

3233
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:02,540
There's a door!

3234
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:06,440
And the symbol of the game.

3235
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:08,820
Oblivion.

3236
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:10,970
Oblivion.

3237
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:16,930
Looking for any mines.

3238
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:19,450
And any guys.

3239
02:11:21,990 --> 02:11:25,550
I don't see anything, so let's go onwards.

3240
02:11:26,430 --> 02:11:27,070
There you are, buddy.

3241
02:11:27,270 --> 02:11:27,630
Let's go.

3242
02:11:29,010 --> 02:11:29,670
Inside.

3243
02:11:31,990 --> 02:11:32,650
Oh god.

3244
02:11:32,650 --> 02:11:33,170
Oh yeah!

3245
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:37,010
Oh no!

3246
02:11:38,570 --> 02:11:38,900
Uh...

3247
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:40,770
That's kinda crazy.

3248
02:11:42,810 --> 02:11:44,030
I'll take that.

3249
02:11:44,410 --> 02:11:45,390
I'll take that.

3250
02:11:46,230 --> 02:11:47,590
We don't want them...

3251
02:11:47,590 --> 02:11:48,790
We wanna take their...

3252
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:52,010
We wanna rob them of whatever they're worth, you know?

3253
02:11:53,470 --> 02:11:54,390
Oops.

3254
02:11:59,210 --> 02:11:59,810
I'm cut.

3255
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:03,530
What the...

3256
02:12:03,530 --> 02:12:04,930
Where'd my arrows go?

3257
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:07,650
He stole them!

3258
02:12:11,770 --> 02:12:12,230
What?

3259
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:13,790
Oh my god!

3260
02:12:14,590 --> 02:12:15,050
Ouch!

3261
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:17,110
Good job, buddy.

3262
02:12:17,110 --> 02:12:18,770
I didn't even see that thing.

3263
02:12:23,530 --> 02:12:24,890
It consumed...

3264
02:12:24,890 --> 02:12:25,090
Okay.

3265
02:12:25,410 --> 02:12:26,230
We gotta go this way.

3266
02:12:27,150 --> 02:12:29,210
We're following that red arrow.

3267
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:31,690
We're doing the quest, everybody.

3268
02:12:32,150 --> 02:12:33,350
We're doing it!

3269
02:12:33,610 --> 02:12:34,750
We're doing it!

3270
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,320
This is quite...

3271
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:46,960
The location.

3272
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:53,120
This is a trapler!

3273
02:12:55,480 --> 02:12:56,080
Dekor!

3274
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:56,420
Okay, no.

3275
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:57,880
Just Dekor.

3276
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,220
Trap or Dekor.

3277
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:00,320
Oh.

3278
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:01,940
Friend?

3279
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:04,660
Fuck.

3280
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:14,280
Deidre Har!

3281
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:16,900
Wait, it kinda sells for a pretty penny.

3282
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:18,120
What's my...

3283
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:18,960
What's my...

3284
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,780
Let's see, my weight at...

3285
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:21,480
Oh wow!

3286
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:23,080
We actually improved so much.

3287
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:25,040
Not friend.

3288
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:26,860
It was like such a cool entrance, though.

3289
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:29,380
I thought that maybe...

3290
02:13:29,380 --> 02:13:30,080
I don't know.

3291
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:30,940
I don't know what I was thinking.

3292
02:13:34,220 --> 02:13:34,680
Oops.

3293
02:13:44,150 --> 02:13:45,470
Sheath thy sword.

3294
02:13:46,430 --> 02:13:47,310
Illend.

3295
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:51,430
I have sneak bonus.

3296
02:14:00,130 --> 02:14:01,050
That's...

3297
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:02,290
Blood fountain?

3298
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:09,180
I don't know what that did, but I feel powerful.

3299
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:10,440
Wait.

3300
02:14:13,620 --> 02:14:14,180
Fifteen.

3301
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:16,260
Aha!

3302
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:20,680
Door to the blood feast!

3303
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,480
Wait, where do these go then?

3304
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:25,620
If that's the blood feast...

3305
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:26,280
Blood feast?

3306
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:28,720
Just the hall?

3307
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:29,200
Boo!

3308
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:32,640
We don't want to go to some boring hall.

3309
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:34,100
We want to go to the blood feast.

3310
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:35,540
Hahaha!

3311
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:37,720
Blood for the blood feast.

3312
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:42,420
Oh, it's just this room again.

3313
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:44,300
Oh my gosh, my eyes.

3314
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:49,640
Oh, it really is like just staring directly into the sun.

3315
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:52,480
We gotta go around it.

3316
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:56,600
What?

3317
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:58,780
I don't know why they said specifically that door.

3318
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:04,730
This one.

3319
02:15:06,150 --> 02:15:08,050
Corridors of dark salvation!

3320
02:15:08,490 --> 02:15:08,930
Hahaha!

3321
02:15:09,930 --> 02:15:11,130
Who's naming these?

3322
02:15:11,510 --> 02:15:11,970
Hahaha!

3323
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:14,630
Who's naming these?

3324
02:15:14,770 --> 02:15:17,250
I hope the bitrate is a bit better...

3325
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:19,150
This time playing.

3326
02:15:20,350 --> 02:15:23,290
I upped the bitrate as well, so...

3327
02:15:32,990 --> 02:15:34,290
We must go up.

3328
02:15:35,230 --> 02:15:36,350
But what's over here?

3329
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:37,650
I'm just curious.

3330
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:38,730
See, look!

3331
02:15:38,890 --> 02:15:40,090
That looks like you could break it!

3332
02:15:40,210 --> 02:15:40,330
No!

3333
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:45,290
My sneak is going crazy in here.

3334
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:00,360
Hello?

3335
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:02,140
Arrow?

3336
02:16:02,540 --> 02:16:03,060
Arrow.

3337
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:04,320
Arrow.

3338
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:04,960
What the?

3339
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:07,820
Why isn't it aiming?

3340
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:09,260
Why?

3341
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:09,980
What the?

3342
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:12,140
Is it...

3343
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:13,780
No, there's no way I'm out...

3344
02:16:13,780 --> 02:16:13,880
Wait.

3345
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:15,580
There's no way I'm out of arrows.

3346
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:17,200
Wait, why aren't they equipped though?

3347
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:23,420
No way!

3348
02:16:23,420 --> 02:16:24,580
I'm almost out of arrows?

3349
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:26,040
Out of steel arrows?

3350
02:16:30,420 --> 02:16:33,960
I have a lot of iron ones, but I've been using the steel ones because they're better.

3351
02:16:35,740 --> 02:16:36,580
Just use the...

3352
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:38,360
I think an iron might be good for now.

3353
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:40,240
I've been...

3354
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:42,600
It's been eating my steel arrows like crazy!

3355
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:45,740
And now I'm almost out.

3356
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:46,720
That sucks.

3357
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:51,020
That sucks so bad.

3358
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:53,520
Hey, other guy.

3359
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:54,140
Where are you?

3360
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:54,880
Oh, there you are.

3361
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:57,540
You don't see me.

3362
02:16:58,680 --> 02:16:59,360
Where'd you go?

3363
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:00,800
Oh, there you are.

3364
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:03,800
Ah!

3365
02:17:04,660 --> 02:17:06,460
No more fancy arrows.

3366
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:08,640
It's okay.

3367
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:09,640
We don't need them.

3368
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:11,040
We're too good.

3369
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:15,000
We don't need no stinking arrows.

3370
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:16,320
Stinking...

3371
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:16,660
Well, no.

3372
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:17,220
That's a lie.

3373
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:18,460
We need arrows.

3374
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:21,080
We don't need no stinking...

3375
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:23,020
fancy arrows.

3376
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:27,800
But I still...

3377
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:29,320
I feel like I've been...

3378
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:30,300
Worship.

3379
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:31,480
We could just...

3380
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:32,620
Chill at the bench.

3381
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:34,800
Um...

3382
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:36,380
I feel like I've been picking them up.

3383
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:37,060
No.

3384
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:39,660
It's kind of crazy that I'm almost out.

3385
02:17:45,270 --> 02:17:46,730
Would you like to join me?

3386
02:17:54,270 --> 02:17:54,790
Nah.

3387
02:17:55,650 --> 02:17:56,650
You look so happy.

3388
02:17:58,970 --> 02:18:00,190
Looks like my cat.

3389
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:03,430
Whenever I pet paws, she makes this face.

3390
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:07,790
I love seeing I see her little bottom teeth.

3391
02:18:08,810 --> 02:18:09,090
Yeah.

3392
02:18:09,150 --> 02:18:10,070
Looks like my cat.

3393
02:18:10,910 --> 02:18:11,350
Wait.

3394
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:14,790
This way.

3395
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:17,990
We almost went...

3396
02:18:18,510 --> 02:18:19,850
We almost went to the citadel.

3397
02:18:20,010 --> 02:18:20,730
No, no, no.

3398
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:23,150
Oh, it needs a key anyway.

3399
02:18:23,650 --> 02:18:24,030
No, no.

3400
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:24,910
Oh.

3401
02:18:25,610 --> 02:18:26,090
Oh.

3402
02:18:26,650 --> 02:18:26,970
Oh, no.

3403
02:18:27,070 --> 02:18:28,510
This guy fell for his own trap.

3404
02:18:32,390 --> 02:18:34,070
What the heck is this place?

3405
02:18:34,550 --> 02:18:36,370
They kill their own friendly fire.

3406
02:18:38,210 --> 02:18:39,290
We need to go here.

3407
02:18:42,090 --> 02:18:43,190
What a bozo.

3408
02:18:46,250 --> 02:18:46,770
Whoa.

3409
02:18:50,350 --> 02:18:52,850
Look, I can see even guys from here.

3410
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:55,230
I can see my house from here.

3411
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:56,590
Wow.

3412
02:18:57,810 --> 02:18:59,150
Oh my gosh.

3413
02:18:59,150 --> 02:19:00,210
This is crazy.

3414
02:19:05,250 --> 02:19:06,990
Look at that view.

3415
02:19:09,110 --> 02:19:10,690
I missed a guy.

3416
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:11,670
I saw him walking.

3417
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:21,780
Reaper's sprawl.

3418
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:25,700
Wait, you don't have a hat.

3419
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:27,080
Oh.

3420
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:27,920
Oh.

3421
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,120
Is that...

3422
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:29,820
Is that our guy?

3423
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:30,620
Oh, sorry.

3424
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:31,760
Uh, where?

3425
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:32,900
Quickly.

3426
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:33,640
I'm coming.

3427
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:35,380
Sorry.

3428
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:36,280
I just...

3429
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:36,880
I got distracted.

3430
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:41,340
Oh my god.

3431
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:41,960
Oh my god.

3432
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:43,860
I don't know how my...

3433
02:19:46,380 --> 02:19:47,000
I don't know how my...

3434
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:47,400
Oh.

3435
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:49,260
You got him.

3436
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:50,420
Over here.

3437
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:51,100
Quickly.

3438
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:56,170
I don't know what just happened with my...

3439
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:58,720
With my bow.

3440
02:19:58,960 --> 02:19:59,320
Again.

3441
02:20:00,480 --> 02:20:01,700
We got all our stuff.

3442
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:07,200
They took your clothes!

3443
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:07,720
Quickly.

3444
02:20:08,020 --> 02:20:08,360
Quickly.

3445
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,060
There's no time.

3446
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:11,640
You must get to the top of the large tower.

3447
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,100
The sigil keep, they call it.

3448
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:15,740
That's what keeps the oblivion gate open.

3449
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:19,820
Find the sigil stone, remove it, and the gate will close.

3450
02:20:20,140 --> 02:20:20,460
Hurry.

3451
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:22,000
The keeper has the key.

3452
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:23,360
You must get the key.

3453
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:24,400
Minion.

3454
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:25,900
I got the key.

3455
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:26,380
Take the key.

3456
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:27,640
Get to the sigil keep.

3457
02:20:27,820 --> 02:20:28,960
And find the sigil stone.

3458
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:29,900
It's the only way.

3459
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:31,540
Don't worry about me.

3460
02:20:31,780 --> 02:20:32,520
There is no time.

3461
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:33,320
Get moving!

3462
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:35,000
He's so selfless.

3463
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:37,020
Actually, he probably feels safer in here, huh?

3464
02:20:37,820 --> 02:20:39,560
That guy doesn't have to do any work now.

3465
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:41,360
Okay.

3466
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:42,320
We're going.

3467
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:46,440
Wait, what's down here?

3468
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:47,560
Oh.

3469
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:48,580
I didn't mean to do that.

3470
02:20:49,940 --> 02:20:50,940
What's down here?

3471
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,320
I'm checking it out real quick.

3472
02:20:57,960 --> 02:20:59,900
I'm checking it out real quick.

3473
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:02,700
I'm checking it out real quick.

3474
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:05,620
It's kind of, it's kind of deep.

3475
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:06,360
Wait.

3476
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:06,820
Oh.

3477
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:08,820
I was going to say, where's my friend?

3478
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,640
What are you doing up there?

3479
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:17,860
He is practicing his witchcraft, I think.

3480
02:21:25,650 --> 02:21:27,790
We'll just let him...

3481
02:21:28,930 --> 02:21:30,630
I don't know.

3482
02:21:35,790 --> 02:21:36,650
No!

3483
02:21:52,270 --> 02:21:53,970
There is no way.

3484
02:21:56,430 --> 02:21:58,090
There is no way.

3485
02:21:58,090 --> 02:21:58,150
Wait.

3486
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:04,290
Oh.

3487
02:22:06,850 --> 02:22:10,530
As soon as I saw that they had a connection, I should have known.

3488
02:22:14,890 --> 02:22:17,250
I don't know what this does, but...

3489
02:22:17,250 --> 02:22:18,350
Oh my god.

3490
02:22:18,350 --> 02:22:18,930
His body is gonna...

3491
02:22:18,930 --> 02:22:20,630
His body is gonna...

3492
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:29,920
43.

3493
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:33,520
Where are we going?

3494
02:22:37,790 --> 02:22:38,890
Free armor?

3495
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:41,930
Oh wait, it's not so heavy at all, actually.

3496
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:45,970
Take his clothes.

3497
02:22:47,410 --> 02:22:48,330
Should I be here?

3498
02:22:48,890 --> 02:22:49,030
Wait.

3499
02:23:00,210 --> 02:23:02,170
I don't know where I need to go, actually.

3500
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:02,830
Quests.

3501
02:23:04,950 --> 02:23:07,270
Let's reach the sigil stone.

3502
02:23:08,430 --> 02:23:11,690
Yeah, we want to go up, but it didn't go...

3503
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:12,950
It can't go up.

3504
02:23:12,950 --> 02:23:13,870
Hmm.

3505
02:23:15,390 --> 02:23:17,070
Yeah, I think we gotta go back out the way we...

3506
02:23:17,070 --> 02:23:18,110
It just works.

3507
02:23:20,870 --> 02:23:22,410
I hear something screaming.

3508
02:23:22,810 --> 02:23:23,010
Okay.

3509
02:23:23,290 --> 02:23:24,750
Well, rip our friend, I guess.

3510
02:23:25,370 --> 02:23:26,930
I was so sad for him.

3511
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:30,210
He was such a good help, though.

3512
02:23:31,390 --> 02:23:34,170
He really found the guys when I couldn't see them.

3513
02:23:34,610 --> 02:23:36,030
Oh, man.

3514
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:41,620
No, he wasn't.

3515
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:42,720
Yes, he was.

3516
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:43,220
He was.

3517
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:45,190
Yes, he was.

3518
02:23:45,820 --> 02:23:46,800
He was a good help.

3519
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:51,300
Okay.

3520
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:53,320
We got that key.

3521
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:55,820
So I imagine it's to...

3522
02:23:55,820 --> 02:23:57,040
This door.

3523
02:23:57,540 --> 02:23:58,580
Yes, sir...

3524
02:23:58,580 --> 02:23:58,860
Nope.

3525
02:24:01,420 --> 02:24:02,960
Yes, siree.

3526
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:06,260
Sigil keep key.

3527
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:16,000
I'm sneaky.

3528
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:16,620
I'm sneaky.

3529
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:17,180
I'm sneaky.

3530
02:24:20,680 --> 02:24:21,120
I'm sneaky.

3531
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:22,540
I'm sneaky.

3532
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:24,480
Oh my god.

3533
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:29,940
Can I ever loot this guy?

3534
02:24:30,580 --> 02:24:31,740
Oh, it says empty.

3535
02:24:31,740 --> 02:24:32,440
I'm so stupid.

3536
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:41,340
Okay, in there, but what's over here?

3537
02:24:43,060 --> 02:24:44,440
Just a little tad...

3538
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:45,680
A tad bit of exploration.

3539
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:50,800
Oh.

3540
02:24:51,960 --> 02:24:52,500
Yes.

3541
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:59,060
Why are all these guys dead to their own traps?

3542
02:24:59,060 --> 02:24:59,200
Yes.

3543
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:04,460
Door to the blood feast.

3544
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:08,620
I still miss my three legion chads from the Kavaj siege.

3545
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:14,500
Oh gosh, I can't see anything in this room.

3546
02:25:18,830 --> 02:25:20,650
I could be ambushed at any moment.

3547
02:25:20,650 --> 02:25:20,670
What?

3548
02:25:23,730 --> 02:25:25,330
That looks like a human though.

3549
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:27,130
Oops.

3550
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:31,520
Oh shoot.

3551
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:36,230
Oh, he just summoned something.

3552
02:25:39,090 --> 02:25:39,650
Oh.

3553
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,960
They placed the traps very well.

3554
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:46,760
Oh yeah, they did.

3555
02:25:48,220 --> 02:25:49,240
Let's take that.

3556
02:25:49,860 --> 02:25:51,280
We'll just take all the potions.

3557
02:25:52,060 --> 02:25:53,300
I'm gonna take the heart.

3558
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:54,340
Oh, restores health.

3559
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:55,640
That's nice.

3560
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:59,240
Summon the gentle gust.

3561
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:03,500
So we got some toughies in here, huh?

3562
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:07,220
Ruined portal to the blood feast.

3563
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:13,860
Wait.

3564
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:15,780
Oh, this is where I need to go.

3565
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:16,220
No?

3566
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:18,880
Oh, what is?

3567
02:26:19,300 --> 02:26:19,780
Oh.

3568
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:21,260
Okay.

3569
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:22,960
Let's go.

3570
02:26:28,660 --> 02:26:29,800
It's quiet.

3571
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:31,740
Oh my gosh.

3572
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:34,700
Fleshy pod.

3573
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:36,060
Is this thing alive?

3574
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:36,880
Or...

3575
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:38,760
It's got little chains on it.

3576
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:39,300
There we go.

3577
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:43,160
Um...

3578
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:45,920
We gotta go this way, but...

3579
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:48,180
The punished.

3580
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:57,660
Ew.

3581
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:02,680
Well, if the gate closes...

3582
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:04,660
And I'm in here...

3583
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:08,800
Um...

3584
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:10,920
How do we get...

3585
02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:12,140
Home?

3586
02:27:17,330 --> 02:27:18,090
Punished.

3587
02:27:18,330 --> 02:27:18,770
Venom.

3588
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:21,890
How do the daedra hearts taste like?

3589
02:27:22,990 --> 02:27:24,350
Like a...

3590
02:27:24,350 --> 02:27:26,430
Like a big ol' raspberry.

3591
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:27,730
Delicious.

3592
02:27:31,290 --> 02:27:32,970
I'll take some more.

3593
02:27:33,330 --> 02:27:34,690
Wait, I can...

3594
02:27:34,690 --> 02:27:36,030
I can pick this.

3595
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:39,970
This doesn't require a key.

3596
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:42,970
Oh.

3597
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:44,390
Dang it.

3598
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:49,960
Aw, man.

3599
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:53,180
I thought I was gonna do like the cool thing.

3600
02:27:57,020 --> 02:27:58,100
What is this anyway?

3601
02:28:10,330 --> 02:28:11,310
Okay, let's go back.

3602
02:28:12,090 --> 02:28:12,690
Get in.

3603
02:28:15,130 --> 02:28:16,670
You pick the lock with the key.

3604
02:28:18,930 --> 02:28:20,450
They never saw it coming.

3605
02:28:21,210 --> 02:28:22,770
They never saw it coming.

3606
02:28:23,090 --> 02:28:23,770
They were like, what?

3607
02:28:24,150 --> 02:28:25,990
How did he get in with such ease?

3608
02:28:27,250 --> 02:28:27,650
Such...

3609
02:28:27,650 --> 02:28:28,590
Oh, oh, oh.

3610
02:28:28,750 --> 02:28:29,330
Oh my gosh.

3611
02:28:35,110 --> 02:28:36,190
Ow, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3612
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:38,550
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3613
02:28:44,030 --> 02:28:44,430
Oof.

3614
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:49,740
I gotta be careful with those guys.

3615
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:50,280
They're tough.

3616
02:28:53,580 --> 02:28:54,600
Almost there.

3617
02:28:55,360 --> 02:28:55,900
Wait.

3618
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:56,300
Eh?

3619
02:28:56,740 --> 02:28:57,020
Ah?

3620
02:28:58,620 --> 02:28:58,920
Wait.

3621
02:28:59,560 --> 02:28:59,640
Eh?

3622
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:00,820
Ah?

3623
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:01,540
Wait.

3624
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:03,500
Wait.

3625
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:08,720
Dagoth, you're welcome to the heart chamber here in Red Mountain.

3626
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:11,780
Wait, go here?

3627
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:16,860
Both doors lead to the same place.

3628
02:29:16,860 --> 02:29:17,680
Oh, no kidding?

3629
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:23,220
I used the key?

3630
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:32,760
Was it a loop?

3631
02:29:37,090 --> 02:29:37,570
Oh!

3632
02:29:41,240 --> 02:29:42,500
It was just a loop.

3633
02:29:42,660 --> 02:29:43,680
Oh my gosh, I was here.

3634
02:29:43,880 --> 02:29:43,920
Oh!

3635
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:44,960
Sneakery!

3636
02:29:45,660 --> 02:29:46,140
Sneakery!

3637
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:48,880
Sneak mastery increase!

3638
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:02,740
Nice!

3639
02:30:08,020 --> 02:30:09,220
Nice!

3640
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:09,640
Nice!

3641
02:30:09,700 --> 02:30:09,920
Nice!

3642
02:30:13,140 --> 02:30:16,700
Is this like the... the... the sigil?

3643
02:30:17,620 --> 02:30:19,220
Do I go on the meatball?

3644
02:30:23,060 --> 02:30:23,500
Nasty.

3645
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:24,820
There's nobody in here, I think.

3646
02:30:24,980 --> 02:30:25,120
Wait.

3647
02:30:26,940 --> 02:30:27,600
On this?

3648
02:30:30,140 --> 02:30:31,720
I didn't even realize this is a staircase.

3649
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:33,840
Wow!

3650
02:30:34,340 --> 02:30:35,460
Poco, thank you for the raid!

3651
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:37,920
Thank you, thank you.

3652
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:39,780
Oh, we can level up too.

3653
02:30:39,780 --> 02:30:41,700
Raymack, thank you so much for the 5 gift of thank you!

3654
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:44,360
Oh, I do need to go into here.

3655
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:44,940
Just kidding.

3656
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:50,780
Thank you for the... gift of thank you!

3657
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:57,000
Oh, I think I need to go up for it.

3658
02:30:58,100 --> 02:30:59,260
It's at the top, yeah.

3659
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:05,360
And if you're wondering why I'm still sneaking around...

3660
02:31:05,360 --> 02:31:06,900
Because I want that sneak bonus.

3661
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:09,200
Wait.

3662
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:12,380
Somebody saw me, but...

3663
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:15,920
I don't know from where or whom's or where.

3664
02:31:20,790 --> 02:31:22,610
Somebody's... trying to attack me.

3665
02:31:28,750 --> 02:31:29,410
Um...

3666
02:31:29,410 --> 02:31:30,250
They're on the staircase?

3667
02:31:30,630 --> 02:31:31,210
They are?

3668
02:31:36,830 --> 02:31:37,350
No?

3669
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:41,360
Oh?

3670
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:41,740
Ah!

3671
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:46,160
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

3672
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:46,820
I'm gonna die.

3673
02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:47,680
I'm gonna die.

3674
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:48,100
Hey!

3675
02:31:53,750 --> 02:31:55,190
Where did he come from?

3676
02:31:56,610 --> 02:31:58,870
Oh, I must have been really blind to him.

3677
02:31:59,050 --> 02:31:59,890
Holy moly.

3678
02:32:00,730 --> 02:32:02,990
I must have been so blind to him!

3679
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:08,440
Wait.

3680
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:11,700
Actually, we should put on our new... armor, right?

3681
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:14,220
What did we get from... chainmail boots?

3682
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:18,140
Aww, say goodbye to our... Oh, everybody who came in!

3683
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:19,940
This is E.T.na.

3684
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:21,840
Definitely not E.T.

3685
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:22,460
in a wig.

3686
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:27,320
Ooh!

3687
02:32:28,120 --> 02:32:28,640
Ooh!

3688
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:30,360
She's looking good!

3689
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:31,240
What else did we get?

3690
02:32:31,900 --> 02:32:32,720
This thing.

3691
02:32:38,620 --> 02:32:39,840
Thanks for being you.

3692
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:40,540
You rock!

3693
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:41,340
Thank you!

3694
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:45,820
But I don't like to put on hats because it ruins her hair.

3695
02:32:47,140 --> 02:32:49,960
And we got our... Oh, we changed our boots.

3696
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:51,820
We were wearing the gold trim shoes.

3697
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,100
Probably better to wear actual armor, huh?

3698
02:32:58,460 --> 02:32:59,520
Oh, I see that guy.

3699
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:00,460
I see that guy over there.

3700
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:01,560
In the shadows.

3701
02:33:07,990 --> 02:33:08,430
Wait.

3702
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:09,750
Can I kill you first?

3703
02:33:12,270 --> 02:33:12,710
Nice!

3704
02:33:16,970 --> 02:33:18,590
Take that chest piece to sell.

3705
02:33:20,990 --> 02:33:21,390
Wait.

3706
02:33:21,590 --> 02:33:22,770
The one that the guy had?

3707
02:33:23,550 --> 02:33:27,850
I wonder if I would be over-encumbered with a... This guy?

3708
02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:29,750
Oh, wait.

3709
02:33:29,890 --> 02:33:30,490
He doesn't have anything.

3710
02:33:31,330 --> 02:33:32,230
Oh, in here, maybe?

3711
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:34,410
This one?

3712
02:33:34,570 --> 02:33:34,890
Wow!

3713
02:33:34,990 --> 02:33:37,010
It is worth a lot, but it's also pretty heavy.

3714
02:33:37,550 --> 02:33:38,510
Am I over-encumbered?

3715
02:33:40,410 --> 02:33:40,810
Close!

3716
02:33:40,810 --> 02:33:41,030
Close!

3717
02:33:42,510 --> 02:33:44,370
This is the way we all play Oblivion.

3718
02:33:45,210 --> 02:33:46,470
Is it really?

3719
02:33:46,810 --> 02:33:48,050
Or are you just saying that?

3720
02:33:49,670 --> 02:33:53,970
If you save the castle in this town's mission, you get a special enchanted version of the armor.

3721
02:33:56,730 --> 02:33:57,190
Really?

3722
02:33:57,990 --> 02:34:00,030
E.T.na kind of looks like you with a suntan.

3723
02:34:01,090 --> 02:34:02,050
I don't tan.

3724
02:34:03,830 --> 02:34:05,610
My ectoplasm burns.

3725
02:34:06,670 --> 02:34:07,930
I don't tan.

3726
02:34:07,930 --> 02:34:08,010
Oh, man.

3727
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:12,840
Okay.

3728
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:15,600
We're gonna go up in just a moment.

3729
02:34:20,940 --> 02:34:24,700
Honestly, my sneak is, like, going crazy right now.

3730
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:35,790
Everybody, wear your sunscreen, okay?

3731
02:34:38,450 --> 02:34:39,930
Wear your sunscreen.

3732
02:34:41,270 --> 02:34:42,730
You mortals.

3733
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:43,990
Oh!

3734
02:34:44,830 --> 02:34:45,370
Oh!

3735
02:34:48,810 --> 02:34:49,410
Wait.

3736
02:34:50,810 --> 02:34:52,490
I kind of want this, though.

3737
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:01,780
Drop some random junk.

3738
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:07,620
What can we... It's only... It's literally one.

3739
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:11,920
This thing is so heavy.

3740
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:13,360
I can get rid of these, huh?

3741
02:35:15,420 --> 02:35:19,980
Uh... Left ship.

3742
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:24,560
That's so heavy.

3743
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:25,100
Sword by weight.

3744
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:25,440
True.

3745
02:35:27,400 --> 02:35:29,040
My long sword...

3746
02:35:32,660 --> 02:35:34,860
Is this better than the long sword?

3747
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:36,660
No.

3748
02:35:37,460 --> 02:35:39,520
But I think I'm okay now if I take it.

3749
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:41,700
Whoa!

3750
02:35:42,140 --> 02:35:43,000
No, I'm not okay.

3751
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:45,980
I'm over-encumbered.

3752
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:47,500
Let's see.

3753
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:53,320
A lot of hearts.

3754
02:35:53,800 --> 02:35:54,980
I took a vase.

3755
02:35:55,380 --> 02:35:57,500
It only sells for 3 gold.

3756
02:36:05,210 --> 02:36:06,750
I'm a cucumber.

3757
02:36:07,570 --> 02:36:08,310
Cucumbered.

3758
02:36:09,510 --> 02:36:10,150
Hmm.

3759
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:12,110
Hmm.

3760
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:18,870
I got some raw... Oh, some rat meat I can get rid of.

3761
02:36:23,450 --> 02:36:25,630
Um... I got a lot of potions.

3762
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:27,250
But they're really way nothing.

3763
02:36:33,380 --> 02:36:34,400
You know what?

3764
02:36:34,640 --> 02:36:36,220
I could get rid of the swords.

3765
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:37,480
Switch out the swords.

3766
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:39,780
Maybe...

3767
02:36:41,480 --> 02:36:43,200
I can get rid of my shoes.

3768
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:48,060
I'll get rid of my shoes.

3769
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:51,300
Click on the snowball tome.

3770
02:36:59,040 --> 02:36:59,520
Yes.

3771
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,560
Like, can I get rid of it now?

3772
02:37:06,980 --> 02:37:08,020
The dogs are out.

3773
02:37:08,140 --> 02:37:10,640
No, we're wearing some new steelies.

3774
02:37:11,720 --> 02:37:12,940
Oh, I can get rid of it.

3775
02:37:13,060 --> 02:37:13,220
Okay.

3776
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:15,120
But I could sell it.

3777
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:16,620
For 21 gold.

3778
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:19,580
It's good to think about the weight value ratio.

3779
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:24,260
Lots of low weight items with high value are better than a few heavy items.

3780
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:25,300
Yeah, I know.

3781
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:28,940
Drop the ale?

3782
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:29,840
Oh, so true!

3783
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:38,080
Oh, I already took it.

3784
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:38,440
That's right.

3785
02:37:39,800 --> 02:37:40,400
That's right.

3786
02:37:41,660 --> 02:37:42,660
Here we go!

3787
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:46,320
Woohoo!

3788
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:48,260
Is it timed?

3789
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:48,900
I'm scared.

3790
02:37:49,500 --> 02:37:49,620
Whoa.

3791
02:37:51,020 --> 02:37:51,460
Whoa!

3792
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:53,620
Am I over encumbered?

3793
02:37:53,620 --> 02:37:53,900
Oh.

3794
02:37:54,340 --> 02:37:54,440
Oh.

3795
02:37:55,240 --> 02:37:55,520
Oh.

3796
02:37:55,900 --> 02:37:56,360
Oh.

3797
02:37:57,060 --> 02:37:57,520
Oh.

3798
02:37:57,520 --> 02:37:57,620
Oh.

3799
02:37:58,200 --> 02:37:58,260
Oh.

3800
02:38:05,780 --> 02:38:05,920
Oh.

3801
02:38:06,460 --> 02:38:07,860
Close an oblivion gate.

3802
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:08,160
Oh!

3803
02:38:09,160 --> 02:38:12,740
I have closed the gate by taking the sigil stone that anchors it within oblivion.

3804
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:16,620
I should tell Salvian Mathias that the way into Kvatch is now open.

3805
02:38:19,320 --> 02:38:20,620
Uh, I'm sorry.

3806
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:20,800
I'm sorry.

3807
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:21,780
No one else made it.

3808
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:22,540
Hahaha!

3809
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:23,800
Um.

3810
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:25,860
It wasn't my fault.

3811
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,140
Like, actually, for once.

3812
02:38:29,420 --> 02:38:30,260
Oh, nice.

3813
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:31,400
Some more steel arrows.

3814
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:36,740
How much is the stone worth?

3815
02:38:38,940 --> 02:38:40,060
What?

3816
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:41,980
Priceless.

3817
02:38:45,820 --> 02:38:47,180
I just saved it.

3818
02:38:47,340 --> 02:38:47,680
Shut up.

3819
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:50,480
Hahaha!

3820
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:51,000
You can do it.

3821
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:53,200
This is our chance to launch a counter-attack.

3822
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:55,140
I need you to come with us.

3823
02:38:55,500 --> 02:38:58,160
You've got far more combat experience than these men.

3824
02:38:58,620 --> 02:38:59,940
How- how is that possible?

3825
02:39:00,620 --> 02:39:02,380
I can wait, but not for long.

3826
02:39:02,680 --> 02:39:06,820
We've got to move quickly before they have a chance to barricade the city gate.

3827
02:39:07,240 --> 02:39:07,720
Okay.

3828
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:09,520
I'm ready.

3829
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:11,200
For Kvatch!

3830
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:13,660
Oh, we're running?

3831
02:39:14,260 --> 02:39:14,760
Uh, we're running?

3832
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:17,480
Hahaha!

3833
02:39:17,820 --> 02:39:18,900
This guy's...

3834
02:39:18,900 --> 02:39:19,640
Hahaha!

3835
02:39:19,640 --> 02:39:19,920
Hahaha!

3836
02:39:22,730 --> 02:39:23,910
We're fine, guys.

3837
02:39:24,210 --> 02:39:24,930
We got this.

3838
02:39:27,810 --> 02:39:28,990
We got this.

3839
02:39:29,150 --> 02:39:30,870
Sigil stones can be used to enchant items.

3840
02:39:31,430 --> 02:39:32,850
Each one has a unique effect.

3841
02:39:33,310 --> 02:39:33,490
Oh.

3842
02:39:34,070 --> 02:39:38,290
I have entered the ruined city of Kvatch with Savlian, Matias, and his men.

3843
02:39:38,390 --> 02:39:41,630
We must clear the southern plaza before the survivors in the chapel can be rescued.

3844
02:39:42,570 --> 02:39:44,190
Oh, they all respawn.

3845
02:39:44,410 --> 02:39:44,990
That sucks.

3846
02:39:46,490 --> 02:39:46,970
Oh.

3847
02:39:47,210 --> 02:39:47,710
Oh my gosh.

3848
02:39:54,010 --> 02:39:54,970
I'm not okay.

3849
02:39:55,230 --> 02:39:55,930
I'm not fine.

3850
02:39:57,210 --> 02:39:58,130
I lied.

3851
02:39:58,330 --> 02:39:58,750
I lied.

3852
02:39:58,870 --> 02:39:59,650
I said I'd be fine.

3853
02:40:00,230 --> 02:40:01,190
I lied.

3854
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:01,690
I lied.

3855
02:40:01,790 --> 02:40:02,770
Oops.

3856
02:40:07,950 --> 02:40:09,650
We did it!

3857
02:40:12,750 --> 02:40:20,430
We're never going to take me to drop.

3858
02:40:23,510 --> 02:40:24,870
Oh, oh, my bad.

3859
02:40:25,730 --> 02:40:27,270
Ooh, her hair was... yep.

3860
02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:37,150
Seal helmet.

3861
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:40,350
Well, it's worth a pretty penny, huh?

3862
02:40:43,630 --> 02:40:47,410
Um... I didn't even do anything.

3863
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:50,890
Mainly because I got scared.

3864
02:40:56,440 --> 02:40:58,500
Good value helmet, yeah.

3865
02:41:00,580 --> 02:41:01,900
We'll want to go back for that.

3866
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:03,100
For sure.

3867
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:06,840
If I jump in these places, can I get out?

3868
02:41:08,620 --> 02:41:09,900
Wait, can I go up here?

3869
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:10,280
I can.

3870
02:41:13,660 --> 02:41:18,420
There was only four little lizards and then... nothing else in this whole place?

3871
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:20,300
This is the whole city?

3872
02:41:20,660 --> 02:41:22,320
This is the entire city.

3873
02:41:22,600 --> 02:41:23,460
You're telling me.

3874
02:41:31,540 --> 02:41:31,940
Whoa!

3875
02:41:34,580 --> 02:41:35,480
Somebody's head.

3876
02:41:43,610 --> 02:41:45,230
We wiped the bastards out.

3877
02:41:45,790 --> 02:41:47,830
It's safe to pull those people out of the chapel.

3878
02:41:48,030 --> 02:41:49,930
Let's get in there and make sure they're all right.

3879
02:41:50,150 --> 02:41:51,470
Yeah, they're probably fine.

3880
02:41:51,570 --> 02:41:53,410
This is only the beginning of the battle for Kabach.

3881
02:41:53,710 --> 02:41:54,030
Oh, oh, really?

3882
02:41:54,250 --> 02:41:54,410
Oh.

3883
02:41:54,490 --> 02:41:56,530
We can discuss the next phase once the civilians are safe.

3884
02:41:56,650 --> 02:41:57,050
Oh, okay.

3885
02:41:58,070 --> 02:41:59,930
Yes, only... oh, there's more?

3886
02:42:04,030 --> 02:42:04,870
Oh, okay.

3887
02:42:06,650 --> 02:42:07,510
Hello, everybody.

3888
02:42:07,510 --> 02:42:09,150
Report, soldier.

3889
02:42:09,650 --> 02:42:11,450
Sir, we're all that's left.

3890
02:42:12,030 --> 02:42:15,070
Barak Indian, myself, and these civilians.

3891
02:42:15,970 --> 02:42:16,730
That's it?

3892
02:42:17,630 --> 02:42:18,910
There's no one else?

3893
02:42:19,310 --> 02:42:22,530
There were others, sir, but they refused to stay put.

3894
02:42:22,770 --> 02:42:26,230
We tried to convince them it was dangerous, but they left anyway.

3895
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:28,270
I guess they didn't make it.

3896
02:42:28,270 --> 02:42:28,790
Oh.

3897
02:42:29,190 --> 02:42:29,530
Very well.

3898
02:42:29,850 --> 02:42:34,250
The area outside the chapel has been cleared, and these people need to be taken to safety.

3899
02:42:34,890 --> 02:42:36,970
Escort them to the camp south of here at once.

3900
02:42:37,530 --> 02:42:40,110
But, sir, I want to help fight.

3901
02:42:40,870 --> 02:42:41,670
You will, soldier.

3902
02:42:42,250 --> 02:42:44,330
Once they're secure, get back here immediately.

3903
02:42:44,910 --> 02:42:49,430
We'll need every available blade, and there'll be plenty of fighting to go around.

3904
02:42:50,230 --> 02:42:51,370
Sir, yes, sir.

3905
02:42:52,130 --> 02:42:54,050
Civilians, it's time to move out.

3906
02:42:54,250 --> 02:42:54,710
Let's go.

3907
02:42:56,950 --> 02:42:57,770
Civilians.

3908
02:42:58,570 --> 02:42:59,810
Let's go see them.

3909
02:43:04,010 --> 02:43:05,290
Who's this guy?

3910
02:43:05,750 --> 02:43:06,990
Where did you come from?

3911
02:43:08,530 --> 02:43:11,510
Where's the priest?

3912
02:43:12,870 --> 02:43:14,470
Wait, where's the priest?

3913
02:43:15,530 --> 02:43:16,190
Hello?

3914
02:43:17,930 --> 02:43:18,750
Future?

3915
02:43:21,310 --> 02:43:23,490
I'm just lucky to be alive.

3916
02:43:26,910 --> 02:43:30,210
You know, your friend did that before he fell to his death.

3917
02:43:30,970 --> 02:43:32,430
Get back on the ground.

3918
02:43:32,610 --> 02:43:33,690
Stay grounded, soldier.

3919
02:43:35,270 --> 02:43:35,970
Now what?

3920
02:43:36,130 --> 02:43:36,710
We've done it.

3921
02:43:37,730 --> 02:43:39,010
I can't believe it.

3922
02:43:39,030 --> 02:43:39,630
His face.

3923
02:43:39,790 --> 02:43:41,390
I didn't really think this would work.

3924
02:43:42,430 --> 02:43:44,630
Maybe we do have a fighting chance.

3925
02:43:45,190 --> 02:43:46,090
Oh, yes.

3926
02:43:46,330 --> 02:43:47,110
We're not done.

3927
02:43:47,210 --> 02:43:48,030
Not even close.

3928
02:43:48,390 --> 02:43:50,350
This was only the first step.

3929
02:43:50,610 --> 02:43:54,190
If this town is to be ours again, we'll need to get inside the castle.

3930
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:56,650
You've come this far with us.

3931
02:43:56,710 --> 02:43:57,190
We've done it.

3932
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:58,770
Will you go further?

3933
02:43:59,310 --> 02:44:03,230
If we're truly going to succeed, I'll need much more of your help.

3934
02:44:03,290 --> 02:44:04,010
We've done it.

3935
02:44:04,010 --> 02:44:04,770
I warn you, though.

3936
02:44:04,930 --> 02:44:09,770
What we've seen so far is nothing compared to the battle that likely awaits us.

3937
02:44:09,970 --> 02:44:10,330
Oh, really?

3938
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:12,890
Take a few moments to catch your breath and think it over.

3939
02:44:12,890 --> 02:44:15,970
When you're ready, let me know and we'll get underway.

3940
02:44:16,570 --> 02:44:17,010
Okay.

3941
02:44:17,590 --> 02:44:18,650
I gotta go sleep.

3942
02:44:20,670 --> 02:44:22,170
All I need is one hour.

3943
02:44:23,650 --> 02:44:24,370
Don't mind me.

3944
02:44:24,530 --> 02:44:25,090
Look at him.

3945
02:44:25,210 --> 02:44:26,930
Look at him with his special eyes.

3946
02:44:29,670 --> 02:44:31,150
I left all the doors open.

3947
02:44:31,370 --> 02:44:34,150
They probably don't know that I robbed the place, though.

3948
02:44:34,250 --> 02:44:34,310
No?

3949
02:44:37,330 --> 02:44:38,590
Level five!

3950
02:44:39,290 --> 02:44:39,570
Woohoo!

3951
02:44:42,210 --> 02:44:43,070
Let's see.

3952
02:44:43,430 --> 02:44:45,110
Let's keep doing our agility.

3953
02:44:45,690 --> 02:44:47,430
That's important for us.

3954
02:44:49,870 --> 02:44:51,210
Why do I only have...

3955
02:44:51,210 --> 02:44:52,190
That's gonna bother me.

3956
02:45:00,690 --> 02:45:02,370
Strength is carrying capacity.

3957
02:45:02,690 --> 02:45:03,290
Yeah, I know.

3958
02:45:04,330 --> 02:45:05,370
I know, I know.

3959
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:08,430
I don't think I'll do strength right now, though.

3960
02:45:10,110 --> 02:45:10,870
Hold on.

3961
02:45:12,170 --> 02:45:12,430
Whoop.

3962
02:45:14,030 --> 02:45:14,950
Determines how quickly...

3963
02:45:14,950 --> 02:45:15,590
Oh, the magicka.

3964
02:45:15,690 --> 02:45:16,010
That's right.

3965
02:45:18,030 --> 02:45:18,470
Endurance...

3966
02:45:18,470 --> 02:45:20,810
Is our health, which is good.

3967
02:45:30,030 --> 02:45:31,750
You need the strength to collect that helm.

3968
02:45:31,930 --> 02:45:32,310
True!

3969
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:33,350
Oh my gosh.

3970
02:45:33,930 --> 02:45:36,610
Maybe I should go sell my stuff before we talk to him.

3971
02:45:37,750 --> 02:45:38,370
You know?

3972
02:45:39,690 --> 02:45:40,170
Maybe...

3973
02:45:40,170 --> 02:45:40,870
We'll do the...

3974
02:45:40,870 --> 02:45:41,030
Wait.

3975
02:45:41,270 --> 02:45:42,530
Let's do like...

3976
02:45:43,930 --> 02:45:44,950
Let's do like that.

3977
02:45:54,140 --> 02:45:54,620
Yeah.

3978
02:45:55,440 --> 02:45:56,300
And then...

3979
02:45:56,300 --> 02:45:57,440
We'll go sell our stuff.

3980
02:45:58,020 --> 02:45:59,440
And then we'll talk to him.

3981
02:46:04,690 --> 02:46:05,590
Let's go...

3982
02:46:05,590 --> 02:46:05,750
Wait.

3983
02:46:05,950 --> 02:46:06,650
What time is it?

3984
02:46:08,610 --> 02:46:09,570
Let's wait...

3985
02:46:09,570 --> 02:46:11,050
For what...

3986
02:46:11,050 --> 02:46:11,910
Let's actually...

3987
02:46:11,910 --> 02:46:13,150
I think we can just run there.

3988
02:46:13,330 --> 02:46:14,290
And then we'll wait...

3989
02:46:14,290 --> 02:46:14,830
While we're there.

3990
02:46:17,030 --> 02:46:17,510
Yeah.

3991
02:46:21,180 --> 02:46:22,060
Oh my gosh.

3992
02:46:22,120 --> 02:46:22,900
You scared me.

3993
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:26,000
Just follow the captain's orders.

3994
02:46:26,420 --> 02:46:26,700
Okay.

3995
02:46:28,460 --> 02:46:29,640
Let's get this.

3996
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:31,300
And then we're gonna sell it.

3997
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:32,720
Wait.

3998
02:46:33,100 --> 02:46:34,020
Oh my god!

3999
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:36,160
Where...

4000
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:37,440
Where the heck did you come from?

4001
02:46:41,300 --> 02:46:41,900
Wait.

4002
02:46:41,900 --> 02:46:43,080
I could sell this.

4003
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:45,100
Am I over-encumbered?

4004
02:46:45,300 --> 02:46:45,900
Yeah.

4005
02:46:45,900 --> 02:46:46,180
Yeah.

4006
02:46:46,980 --> 02:46:47,500
Oh.

4007
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:48,780
Like a lot?

4008
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:49,900
Like a lot?

4009
02:46:49,900 --> 02:46:50,760
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

4010
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:51,400
Uh.

4011
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:54,080
Ugh.

4012
02:46:55,180 --> 02:46:55,840
Ugh.

4013
02:46:57,100 --> 02:46:57,700
Ugh.

4014
02:46:59,060 --> 02:46:59,780
Ugh.

4015
02:46:59,940 --> 02:47:01,320
I just need the helmet.

4016
02:47:03,960 --> 02:47:05,560
I just need the helmet.

4017
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:07,380
Ha ha ha.

4018
02:47:13,030 --> 02:47:13,750
Ugh.

4019
02:47:14,870 --> 02:47:15,290
Okay.

4020
02:47:15,490 --> 02:47:16,710
I can't do this.

4021
02:47:16,930 --> 02:47:17,810
Where is it?

4022
02:47:21,170 --> 02:47:23,350
It'll take us five years to get to the camp.

4023
02:47:32,320 --> 02:47:35,060
Wait, did these ha... Oh, I already looted these things, didn't I?

4024
02:47:37,320 --> 02:47:37,720
Yeah,

4025
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:42,860
my noodle legs.

4026
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:47,400
What?

4027
02:47:47,540 --> 02:47:48,420
What do you mean, top?

4028
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:49,780
What were you guys saying at the top?

4029
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:52,440
Oh, who are you guys?

4030
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:56,720
What do you seek?

4031
02:47:57,100 --> 02:47:57,760
What are you doing?

4032
02:47:58,540 --> 02:47:59,720
I'll never forget him.

4033
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:02,580
He saved as many as he could that terrible night.

4034
02:48:03,060 --> 02:48:05,760
If only they'd listen and stay with us in the chapel.

4035
02:48:08,140 --> 02:48:08,940
Take care.

4036
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:09,600
Bye-bye.

4037
02:48:13,160 --> 02:48:14,520
Talking about the list, you're fine.

4038
02:48:14,660 --> 02:48:16,000
Oh, oh, I get what you mean.

4039
02:48:16,500 --> 02:48:18,620
The mace was at the top of the list.

4040
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:19,840
Oh, thank you, guys.

4041
02:48:20,580 --> 02:48:20,980
Heh heh heh.

4042
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:23,440
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.

4043
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:25,240
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

4044
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:27,600
Heh heh heh heh heh.

4045
02:48:28,120 --> 02:48:28,700
Hee hee.

4046
02:48:29,620 --> 02:48:30,500
Heh heh heh heh.

4047
02:48:31,340 --> 02:48:35,460
T-tot-tot-tuh, t-tot-tot.

4048
02:48:38,990 --> 02:48:40,030
Look at us go.

4049
02:48:40,770 --> 02:48:41,490
We're running.

4050
02:48:41,590 --> 02:48:42,810
I'm gonna invest in speed.

4051
02:48:43,610 --> 02:48:44,070
Eventually.

4052
02:48:44,730 --> 02:48:45,790
Wait, where's the camp?

4053
02:48:46,110 --> 02:48:46,870
Oh, a little bit.

4054
02:48:46,970 --> 02:48:47,770
Okay, I don't remember this.

4055
02:48:49,110 --> 02:48:50,010
Wee, woohoo!

4056
02:49:01,220 --> 02:49:01,700
What?

4057
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:05,240
Oh, they're all down here now!

4058
02:49:17,820 --> 02:49:20,120
Oh, this guy, right?

4059
02:49:23,160 --> 02:49:25,620
That's so cute that they're all in the little village now.

4060
02:49:26,240 --> 02:49:26,720
Hello!

4061
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:35,200
Am I more famous, popular now?

4062
02:49:36,700 --> 02:49:38,120
When's your store open?

4063
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:38,440
Bye.

4064
02:49:39,500 --> 02:49:41,260
Well, let me sell things, please.

4065
02:49:43,640 --> 02:49:47,280
Honestly, I should be able to steal whatever the heck I want right now and...

4066
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:48,740
get away with it.

4067
02:49:51,180 --> 02:49:53,040
It's the smell, really.

4068
02:49:53,580 --> 02:49:55,040
Smoke and fire.

4069
02:49:55,760 --> 02:49:57,060
Something worse.

4070
02:49:57,680 --> 02:49:58,700
In the ruins.

4071
02:49:59,540 --> 02:49:59,920
Gods.

4072
02:50:01,360 --> 02:50:02,060
Okay.

4073
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:04,220
Maybe I'm gonna wait...

4074
02:50:04,220 --> 02:50:05,600
one hour.

4075
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:07,980
Okay.

4076
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:10,100
Most stores open at eight.

4077
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:12,560
I just can't sleep.

4078
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:14,520
I lie down and close my eyes.

4079
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:14,740
It's the smell, really.

4080
02:50:14,840 --> 02:50:16,480
Everybody's talking about the smell.

4081
02:50:17,720 --> 02:50:18,820
Imagine the smell.

4082
02:50:19,320 --> 02:50:21,100
You've done us a great service, stranger.

4083
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:22,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

4084
02:50:22,060 --> 02:50:22,920
We are all grateful.

4085
02:50:23,180 --> 02:50:24,360
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

4086
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:25,400
Oh my god, still!

4087
02:50:25,800 --> 02:50:26,440
Be seeing you.

4088
02:50:26,740 --> 02:50:27,700
Yeah, you will.

4089
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:29,060
In one hour, exactly.

4090
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:30,580
They open at eight.

4091
02:50:30,580 --> 02:50:30,900
Okay.

4092
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:35,740
Imagine the smell.

4093
02:50:36,380 --> 02:50:37,200
The boss is finished.

4094
02:50:37,540 --> 02:50:38,540
It's the smell, really.

4095
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:40,500
Smoke and fire.

4096
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:42,460
Something worse.

4097
02:50:43,440 --> 02:50:44,300
In the ruins.

4098
02:50:44,840 --> 02:50:45,480
Gods.

4099
02:50:46,220 --> 02:50:47,560
I don't even notice anymore.

4100
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:49,900
I guess you can get used to anything.

4101
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:52,360
I'm just lucky to be alive.

4102
02:50:56,300 --> 02:50:58,100
Oh, they're so funny.

4103
02:50:59,320 --> 02:50:59,880
Okay.

4104
02:51:02,280 --> 02:51:03,320
The smell.

4105
02:51:03,560 --> 02:51:05,000
You think they're going to talk about the smell again?

4106
02:51:06,940 --> 02:51:08,500
Anybody got that smell?

4107
02:51:09,900 --> 02:51:11,560
Anybody got that smell?

4108
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:12,560
The boss is finished.

4109
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:13,620
There's nothing.

4110
02:51:16,840 --> 02:51:18,460
Happy to finally catch you live.

4111
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:19,020
Have fun, Mito.

4112
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:19,680
Thank you!

4113
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:20,980
Wait.

4114
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:22,520
Where is he?

4115
02:51:23,380 --> 02:51:24,760
Oh my god.

4116
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:27,940
He left the tent!

4117
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:32,140
I'm just lucky to be alive.

4118
02:51:32,140 --> 02:51:32,600
Oh, there you are.

4119
02:51:33,320 --> 02:51:35,520
You've done us a great service, stranger.

4120
02:51:35,940 --> 02:51:37,240
We are all grateful.

4121
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:38,940
Yeah, now let me...

4122
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:41,580
I thought you were...

4123
02:51:41,580 --> 02:51:43,160
I thought you were...

4124
02:51:43,740 --> 02:51:44,000
Why?

4125
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:51,920
Oh, you don't like me even though I just saved your ass?

4126
02:51:55,440 --> 02:51:56,420
I'm angry.

4127
02:51:56,740 --> 02:51:58,100
I wanna stay angry.

4128
02:51:58,760 --> 02:51:59,000
Take care.

4129
02:51:59,020 --> 02:52:00,200
That anger keeps me going.

4130
02:52:01,100 --> 02:52:01,660
This...

4131
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:03,420
Try the oraker?

4132
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:05,000
You closed the gate.

4133
02:52:05,740 --> 02:52:08,540
That's the first good news in a long time.

4134
02:52:10,140 --> 02:52:10,740
Oh!

4135
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:11,980
Bartering!

4136
02:52:12,140 --> 02:52:12,960
Oh my gosh, thank you guys.

4137
02:52:13,180 --> 02:52:14,420
What can I interest you in?

4138
02:52:15,060 --> 02:52:16,180
Wait, what's our...

4139
02:52:16,180 --> 02:52:17,300
What's our disposition at?

4140
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:18,680
11!

4141
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:20,400
Okay.

4142
02:52:21,780 --> 02:52:22,340
Um...

4143
02:52:22,340 --> 02:52:23,720
Hello, Batool.

4144
02:52:24,380 --> 02:52:24,820
What?

4145
02:52:25,260 --> 02:52:26,800
She only has 200 gold.

4146
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:29,120
It's okay.

4147
02:52:29,360 --> 02:52:30,960
We gotta get rid of some stuff, you know?

4148
02:52:35,330 --> 02:52:36,790
She likes a good joke.

4149
02:52:37,390 --> 02:52:39,130
You can't scare me.

4150
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:44,260
Don't make me laugh.

4151
02:52:44,500 --> 02:52:45,380
I have to remember how to do this.

4152
02:52:45,400 --> 02:52:45,860
I like that.

4153
02:52:46,020 --> 02:52:46,660
A lot.

4154
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:47,900
Yeah.

4155
02:52:48,360 --> 02:52:49,200
Oh, shoot.

4156
02:52:49,440 --> 02:52:50,260
I messed up.

4157
02:52:50,260 --> 02:52:51,060
Oh, wait.

4158
02:52:51,200 --> 02:52:51,740
No, she likes this.

4159
02:52:51,860 --> 02:52:52,620
It's good of you to say so.

4160
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:54,060
Nice.

4161
02:52:55,180 --> 02:52:55,540
Okay.

4162
02:52:56,600 --> 02:52:56,960
Cool.

4163
02:52:57,200 --> 02:52:58,660
We got her up quite a bit.

4164
02:52:59,700 --> 02:53:00,060
Uh...

4165
02:53:00,060 --> 02:53:00,640
Let's do it again.

4166
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:03,020
Blah, blah, blah.

4167
02:53:03,180 --> 02:53:04,000
What up, boar?

4168
02:53:04,120 --> 02:53:05,080
Blah, blah, blah.

4169
02:53:07,220 --> 02:53:07,580
Uh...

4170
02:53:07,580 --> 02:53:08,940
Oh, that's great.

4171
02:53:09,140 --> 02:53:09,400
Oh, no!

4172
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:10,880
Wait, I messed up.

4173
02:53:11,240 --> 02:53:12,460
You can't scare...

4174
02:53:13,460 --> 02:53:14,420
Okay, let's try again.

4175
02:53:16,420 --> 02:53:16,780
Oh...

4176
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:17,680
Where, where, where, where?

4177
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:19,820
You're a big, fat liar.

4178
02:53:20,760 --> 02:53:21,400
Oh...

4179
02:53:21,400 --> 02:53:21,940
Thank you.

4180
02:53:22,320 --> 02:53:22,960
Oh...

4181
02:53:23,420 --> 02:53:23,840
Oh, okay.

4182
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:26,240
Okay, we got some more.

4183
02:53:26,480 --> 02:53:26,760
How's it going again?

4184
02:53:27,340 --> 02:53:28,400
You're doing fine?

4185
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:29,040
Thank you.

4186
02:53:30,040 --> 02:53:30,500
Okay.

4187
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:32,640
You can't scare me.

4188
02:53:33,020 --> 02:53:34,900
It's not the best, but...

4189
02:53:34,900 --> 02:53:35,080
Oh, no.

4190
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:36,240
That's really...

4191
02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:37,320
You're a big, fat liar.

4192
02:53:37,400 --> 02:53:38,060
Oh, my gosh.

4193
02:53:38,140 --> 02:53:39,420
We were at 70.

4194
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,660
You're a big phony.

4195
02:53:42,460 --> 02:53:43,960
You're a big phony.

4196
02:53:43,960 --> 02:53:46,300
You're a big, fat liar.

4197
02:53:46,620 --> 02:53:47,480
How nice.

4198
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:49,460
How nice.

4199
02:53:49,460 --> 02:53:49,980
Is that...

4200
02:53:49,980 --> 02:53:50,560
That's real.

4201
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:52,020
Oh, so close!

4202
02:53:52,580 --> 02:53:54,100
So stinking close.

4203
02:53:55,220 --> 02:53:56,020
Oh, oh, oh.

4204
02:53:56,160 --> 02:53:56,820
Okay, okay, okay.

4205
02:53:57,860 --> 02:53:58,840
Uh, shoot.

4206
02:53:59,160 --> 02:53:59,980
That's correct!

4207
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:01,180
Don't make me laugh.

4208
02:54:01,800 --> 02:54:03,340
You're wasting your...

4209
02:54:03,340 --> 02:54:04,100
You're too kind.

4210
02:54:04,100 --> 02:54:04,620
Woo-hoo!

4211
02:54:06,880 --> 02:54:07,740
All right.

4212
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:08,580
I get it.

4213
02:54:09,820 --> 02:54:10,900
We did it!

4214
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:13,400
Nice.

4215
02:54:14,060 --> 02:54:14,580
Okay.

4216
02:54:15,240 --> 02:54:15,620
Okay.

4217
02:54:16,500 --> 02:54:17,440
Let's, uh...

4218
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:18,020
Let's ask her.

4219
02:54:18,180 --> 02:54:19,000
I don't like to talk about it.

4220
02:54:19,140 --> 02:54:20,520
I don't remember much.

4221
02:54:20,720 --> 02:54:22,700
I woke to screaming and fire.

4222
02:54:22,940 --> 02:54:23,520
I ran.

4223
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:25,280
I was lucky.

4224
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:26,200
I survived.

4225
02:54:26,780 --> 02:54:27,920
I survived.

4226
02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:29,520
My friends weren't so lucky.

4227
02:54:29,780 --> 02:54:30,060
Aww.

4228
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:33,120
Anyway, uh, how much money you got?

4229
02:54:33,220 --> 02:54:34,140
Now look at my wares.

4230
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:36,020
I'm sure there's something to suit you.

4231
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:36,560
Yes.

4232
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:37,880
I'm sure.

4233
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:39,020
All right.

4234
02:54:39,100 --> 02:54:40,240
Let's sell like this.

4235
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:41,220
Wait.

4236
02:54:41,380 --> 02:54:42,660
Oh, haggle, haggle, haggle.

4237
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:48,140
What if I did...

4238
02:54:48,140 --> 02:54:50,820
What if I did 60% of value?

4239
02:54:56,620 --> 02:54:58,320
I can't do that.

4240
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:01,740
55.

4241
02:55:02,420 --> 02:55:03,520
Final offer.

4242
02:55:04,860 --> 02:55:06,980
I can't afford to do that.

4243
02:55:08,580 --> 02:55:09,380
50.

4244
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:11,520
Final offer.

4245
02:55:11,520 --> 02:55:14,720
You've gotta be kidding.

4246
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:17,140
Uh...

4247
02:55:17,140 --> 02:55:17,670
F...

4248
02:55:18,160 --> 02:55:18,340
45.

4249
02:55:19,580 --> 02:55:21,200
Final offer.

4250
02:55:24,620 --> 02:55:25,220
Final offer.

4251
02:55:25,220 --> 02:55:27,400
You don't expect me to make that deal, do you?

4252
02:55:30,950 --> 02:55:31,480
40.

4253
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:34,840
Our disposition went down.

4254
02:55:35,440 --> 02:55:36,680
Final offer.

4255
02:55:38,060 --> 02:55:40,120
You need to make a better offer.

4256
02:55:42,660 --> 02:55:44,500
I appreciate your business.

4257
02:55:44,740 --> 02:55:45,360
I don't.

4258
02:55:46,820 --> 02:55:47,380
Please.

4259
02:55:47,860 --> 02:55:48,360
Go on.

4260
02:55:50,440 --> 02:55:51,560
Oh, please.

4261
02:55:52,180 --> 02:55:53,320
You're too kind.

4262
02:55:53,540 --> 02:55:54,360
I like that.

4263
02:55:54,560 --> 02:55:55,880
You're full of it.

4264
02:55:56,060 --> 02:55:57,140
You're full of it.

4265
02:55:57,140 --> 02:55:57,540
I see.

4266
02:55:58,180 --> 02:55:58,740
Okay.

4267
02:55:59,660 --> 02:56:00,240
All right.

4268
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:00,880
Yeah, yeah.

4269
02:56:01,560 --> 02:56:02,280
Yeah, yeah.

4270
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:02,600
Okay.

4271
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:03,080
More...

4272
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:04,440
More bartering, please.

4273
02:56:04,780 --> 02:56:05,660
Have a look around.

4274
02:56:05,860 --> 02:56:08,440
You won't find better prices in old town.

4275
02:56:09,260 --> 02:56:10,580
Thank you.

4276
02:56:11,320 --> 02:56:11,760
Okay.

4277
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:14,120
38.

4278
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:16,940
Final offer.

4279
02:56:20,910 --> 02:56:23,060
You're trying to drive me out of business.

4280
02:56:28,700 --> 02:56:29,600
35.

4281
02:56:34,170 --> 02:56:35,730
Final offer.

4282
02:56:37,530 --> 02:56:39,090
Oh, my God.

4283
02:56:39,090 --> 02:56:39,610
It worked.

4284
02:56:43,310 --> 02:56:45,390
Wait, let's just get rid of some of the...

4285
02:56:45,390 --> 02:56:46,070
Oh, gosh.

4286
02:56:46,930 --> 02:56:48,330
Resist poison on self.

4287
02:56:48,350 --> 02:56:49,210
It's so heavy.

4288
02:56:49,330 --> 02:56:50,270
I just want to get rid of it.

4289
02:56:53,050 --> 02:56:54,270
That's a fair deal.

4290
02:56:55,330 --> 02:56:56,010
Is it?

4291
02:56:56,330 --> 02:56:56,890
Is it?

4292
02:57:00,510 --> 02:57:03,110
I just noticed I have two steel long swords.

4293
02:57:03,250 --> 02:57:04,290
When did I get a second one?

4294
02:57:05,790 --> 02:57:07,610
Why is this one so much more heavy?

4295
02:57:10,470 --> 02:57:12,130
That seems a fair price.

4296
02:57:14,390 --> 02:57:16,370
Oh, long sword, short sword.

4297
02:57:16,630 --> 02:57:17,290
Oh, I can't read.

4298
02:57:20,290 --> 02:57:21,670
Just dump them on her.

4299
02:57:22,230 --> 02:57:23,730
We'll keep the short sword.

4300
02:57:30,780 --> 02:57:31,280
Okay.

4301
02:57:32,920 --> 02:57:34,140
We should be...

4302
02:57:34,140 --> 02:57:34,580
Oh, wait.

4303
02:57:34,660 --> 02:57:35,840
Here's some nuggets.

4304
02:57:35,840 --> 02:57:35,920
What?

4305
02:57:36,500 --> 02:57:38,400
That's more than I'd usually pay.

4306
02:57:40,040 --> 02:57:41,080
Is it now?

4307
02:57:41,300 --> 02:57:41,720
Okay.

4308
02:57:42,160 --> 02:57:43,880
Oh, she must really like ice, huh?

4309
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:45,980
The claymore is heavy.

4310
02:57:46,100 --> 02:57:47,540
It is, but...

4311
02:57:48,520 --> 02:57:51,480
I feel like I could get a better price for it, no?

4312
02:57:55,400 --> 02:57:56,440
Short damage...

4313
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:58,540
Short damage determined by agility.

4314
02:57:58,920 --> 02:58:00,200
Long damage determined by strength.

4315
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:00,640
So, yeah.

4316
02:58:00,820 --> 02:58:01,740
Keeping the short...

4317
02:58:01,740 --> 02:58:03,320
Sword would be much better for me.

4318
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:06,160
You have a lot of money.

4319
02:58:06,500 --> 02:58:06,940
What?

4320
02:58:07,560 --> 02:58:09,360
I have pennies.

4321
02:58:09,700 --> 02:58:11,360
I gotta be able to buy a house.

4322
02:58:13,060 --> 02:58:13,940
Just sell it.

4323
02:58:14,060 --> 02:58:14,500
Okay.

4324
02:58:17,500 --> 02:58:17,940
Okay.

4325
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:20,160
Come back and see me again.

4326
02:58:20,160 --> 02:58:20,580
Wait.

4327
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:22,660
What was it that I was wanting to...

4328
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:23,340
Buy?

4329
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:25,280
Have a look around.

4330
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:28,460
You won't find better prices in all Tamriel.

4331
02:58:31,900 --> 02:58:33,100
Maybe nothing.

4332
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:36,940
Steel arrows.

4333
02:58:37,260 --> 02:58:38,160
Yeah, but...

4334
02:58:39,400 --> 02:58:40,660
She's got none.

4335
02:58:40,660 --> 02:58:41,900
We see.

4336
02:58:43,460 --> 02:58:43,920
Thank you.

4337
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:46,800
I've looked everywhere.

4338
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:48,780
Perhaps she's still in Kavach.

4339
02:58:49,140 --> 02:58:49,760
In a basement.

4340
02:58:49,980 --> 02:58:50,340
Hiding?

4341
02:58:50,620 --> 02:58:51,400
It's possible.

4342
02:58:51,860 --> 02:58:54,280
Or maybe she got out and she's looking for you too.

4343
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:56,060
Kavach is finished.

4344
02:58:56,400 --> 02:58:57,500
There's nothing left.

4345
02:58:58,260 --> 02:58:59,960
Everybody is such a downer.

4346
02:59:04,520 --> 02:59:05,100
Okay.

4347
02:59:09,010 --> 02:59:10,210
Alrighty, guys.

4348
02:59:13,110 --> 02:59:14,370
Alrighty, guys.

4349
02:59:14,370 --> 02:59:15,450
We go back up.

4350
02:59:28,560 --> 02:59:29,080
Hello.

4351
02:59:33,380 --> 02:59:35,340
They literally lost their homes.

4352
02:59:36,620 --> 02:59:38,080
Yeah, and like all...

4353
02:59:38,900 --> 02:59:42,020
All 20 people that were living in this kingdom.

4354
02:59:42,940 --> 02:59:44,340
Does this count as a kingdom?

4355
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:45,820
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

4356
02:59:48,620 --> 02:59:51,120
And now we get to see the city in the daylight.

4357
02:59:51,300 --> 02:59:51,820
So that's fine.

4358
02:59:54,680 --> 02:59:55,680
Ooh, it's...

4359
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:56,600
Dusty.

4360
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:01,240
It's dusty in here.

4361
03:00:02,360 --> 03:00:04,360
Can we go in...

4362
03:00:04,360 --> 03:00:04,780
Woah.

4363
03:00:06,860 --> 03:00:07,980
Alright.

4364
03:00:08,640 --> 03:00:09,180
Alright.

4365
03:00:13,210 --> 03:00:14,390
It's a county.

4366
03:00:17,170 --> 03:00:19,050
I also wonder the smell.

4367
03:00:19,650 --> 03:00:20,910
Are you ready to go?

4368
03:00:21,170 --> 03:00:21,610
Are you ready to go?

4369
03:00:21,610 --> 03:00:24,490
We need your help getting to the castle, but we need to move soon.

4370
03:00:26,170 --> 03:00:26,650
Uh...

4371
03:00:26,650 --> 03:00:27,330
Yeah.

4372
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:30,630
I knew you'd be up to it.

4373
03:00:31,090 --> 03:00:33,090
Our goal is the castle gate.

4374
03:00:33,290 --> 03:00:33,470
Okay.

4375
03:00:33,790 --> 03:00:38,030
We should be able to use this door to get out to the plaza in front of the castle gatehouse.

4376
03:00:38,170 --> 03:00:38,410
Okay.

4377
03:00:38,810 --> 03:00:39,630
You know the drill.

4378
03:00:39,950 --> 03:00:41,870
Stick close and keep your eyes open.

4379
03:00:42,430 --> 03:00:43,370
Let's move out!

4380
03:00:43,750 --> 03:00:44,230
Autobots!

4381
03:00:44,570 --> 03:00:45,050
Okay.

4382
03:00:45,870 --> 03:00:48,230
I'm gonna sneak, cause it gives me more damage.

4383
03:00:50,830 --> 03:00:51,150
Okay.

4384
03:00:55,690 --> 03:00:57,130
I think he sees me.

4385
03:00:59,510 --> 03:01:00,150
Snipe!

4386
03:01:01,330 --> 03:01:01,970
Oh.

4387
03:01:02,830 --> 03:01:03,150
Uh...

4388
03:01:03,150 --> 03:01:03,890
Snipe!

4389
03:01:05,850 --> 03:01:06,810
Oh, I did get him.

4390
03:01:07,150 --> 03:01:07,870
Holy cow!

4391
03:01:10,390 --> 03:01:11,030
Oh!

4392
03:01:11,410 --> 03:01:12,830
Who just shot that at me?

4393
03:01:13,970 --> 03:01:15,090
What's that at me?

4394
03:01:15,530 --> 03:01:16,550
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

4395
03:01:17,770 --> 03:01:18,510
Did we...

4396
03:01:18,510 --> 03:01:19,270
Clear it?

4397
03:01:19,570 --> 03:01:20,430
Is it cleared?

4398
03:01:20,850 --> 03:01:21,550
Clear!

4399
03:01:22,050 --> 03:01:22,790
Hold.

4400
03:01:24,970 --> 03:01:26,070
Take that.

4401
03:01:27,450 --> 03:01:28,490
The hearts sell.

4402
03:01:29,510 --> 03:01:30,790
For good amount.

4403
03:01:38,450 --> 03:01:39,190
Um...

4404
03:01:39,190 --> 03:01:40,670
I'm checking the area?

4405
03:01:40,910 --> 03:01:41,790
The surrounding area?

4406
03:01:46,240 --> 03:01:47,150
Just in case?

4407
03:01:47,150 --> 03:01:48,290
I think it's clear.

4408
03:01:49,650 --> 03:01:50,690
They're tasty too.

4409
03:01:50,870 --> 03:01:51,110
I know.

4410
03:01:51,290 --> 03:01:52,070
They taste like raspberry.

4411
03:01:55,310 --> 03:01:56,110
I know.

4412
03:01:59,650 --> 03:02:00,610
I think you're good.

4413
03:02:00,890 --> 03:02:01,270
I think...

4414
03:02:01,270 --> 03:02:01,350
Oh!

4415
03:02:01,550 --> 03:02:01,790
Wait.

4416
03:02:01,970 --> 03:02:02,670
What are they doing?

4417
03:02:03,230 --> 03:02:03,630
Wait.

4418
03:02:03,870 --> 03:02:04,370
What are they doing?

4419
03:02:04,790 --> 03:02:05,090
Wait.

4420
03:02:05,190 --> 03:02:05,710
Where did they go?

4421
03:02:05,710 --> 03:02:07,530
I just saw him run into here?

4422
03:02:07,970 --> 03:02:08,850
Where is he?

4423
03:02:09,330 --> 03:02:10,130
Where did he go?

4424
03:02:10,450 --> 03:02:11,650
Where did that man go?

4425
03:02:12,130 --> 03:02:12,670
Where...

4426
03:02:12,670 --> 03:02:13,570
Where is he?

4427
03:02:14,730 --> 03:02:16,110
Where did he go?

4428
03:02:17,090 --> 03:02:18,490
Where's the rest of the men?

4429
03:02:25,820 --> 03:02:27,040
Why did that happen?

4430
03:02:30,360 --> 03:02:31,880
Where did he go?

4431
03:02:39,160 --> 03:02:39,960
Oh!

4432
03:02:39,960 --> 03:02:40,740
I hope the...

4433
03:02:40,740 --> 03:02:43,340
Rain isn't destroying the bitrate too much.

4434
03:02:47,740 --> 03:02:50,760
Leathered laced pants just sounds way too sexy.

4435
03:02:56,180 --> 03:02:56,980
Oh!

4436
03:02:57,200 --> 03:02:57,940
There he is!

4437
03:02:59,780 --> 03:03:00,180
Oh!

4438
03:03:01,820 --> 03:03:02,720
We're not good.

4439
03:03:03,980 --> 03:03:04,800
Where are you...

4440
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:05,020
Oh!

4441
03:03:06,600 --> 03:03:07,700
There's someone...

4442
03:03:07,700 --> 03:03:09,260
Firing fireballs from above.

4443
03:03:10,060 --> 03:03:10,920
I think?

4444
03:03:12,180 --> 03:03:12,820
Or...

4445
03:03:12,820 --> 03:03:13,440
From...

4446
03:03:13,440 --> 03:03:14,120
From somewhere?

4447
03:03:14,380 --> 03:03:14,560
Oh!

4448
03:03:15,900 --> 03:03:17,100
Boss, get there.

4449
03:03:17,480 --> 03:03:19,180
That's an enemy gunship.

4450
03:03:19,320 --> 03:03:19,920
Wait, where...

4451
03:03:20,820 --> 03:03:22,020
You're alive, right?

4452
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:25,100
Where is it?

4453
03:03:25,320 --> 03:03:25,820
Am I...

4454
03:03:25,820 --> 03:03:26,600
I'm so blind.

4455
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:28,040
I can't see anything in this game.

4456
03:03:34,700 --> 03:03:35,340
Oh, wait.

4457
03:03:38,720 --> 03:03:39,780
Oh, I saw him!

4458
03:03:40,020 --> 03:03:41,160
He just walked past.

4459
03:03:45,360 --> 03:03:46,400
You saw him too?

4460
03:03:46,700 --> 03:03:48,120
Oh, wait, wait, I see him?

4461
03:03:48,400 --> 03:03:49,560
I'm just gonna go for it.

4462
03:03:52,640 --> 03:03:53,080
Oops.

4463
03:03:57,220 --> 03:03:58,080
Just a little bit.

4464
03:04:00,060 --> 03:04:01,020
Oh, come on.

4465
03:04:02,500 --> 03:04:03,640
Okay, I'm just gonna talk to him.

4466
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:04,020
Damn it!

4467
03:04:04,320 --> 03:04:05,400
This is no good!

4468
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,160
The gates are locked.

4469
03:04:07,300 --> 03:04:10,220
And the only way to open them is from within the gatehouse.

4470
03:04:10,380 --> 03:04:10,780
Oh.

4471
03:04:12,860 --> 03:04:14,740
We can't open that gate from out here.

4472
03:04:14,900 --> 03:04:17,820
The only mechanism for raising it is inside the gatehouse.

4473
03:04:17,820 --> 03:04:18,720
Where's the gatehouse?

4474
03:04:18,860 --> 03:04:24,060
And the only way to get into the gatehouse now would be through the passage at the north guardhouse.

4475
03:04:24,240 --> 03:04:25,880
But that's always kept locked.

4476
03:04:26,040 --> 03:04:27,260
Oh, well, you're talking to him.

4477
03:04:27,380 --> 03:04:28,440
Hurry and find Baruch Inion.

4478
03:04:28,580 --> 03:04:28,880
Who?

4479
03:04:28,960 --> 03:04:30,240
He should be back in the chapel.

4480
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:33,240
And should still have the key to the guardhouse.

4481
03:04:33,440 --> 03:04:36,140
Well, I was gonna say, you're talking to a master lockpick.

4482
03:04:36,460 --> 03:04:36,660
Once you've got it, get to the guardhouse.

4483
03:04:36,680 --> 03:04:39,100
Find the passage and open that gate.

4484
03:04:39,560 --> 03:04:42,220
Then we can get inside the castle and secure it.

4485
03:04:42,460 --> 03:04:42,900
Okay.

4486
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:44,160
Oh, wait.

4487
03:04:44,340 --> 03:04:44,540
Get moving!

4488
03:04:44,840 --> 03:04:47,160
We can't do a thing until you get those gates open!

4489
03:04:47,300 --> 03:04:47,620
Okay!

4490
03:04:48,340 --> 03:04:48,560
Okay!

4491
03:04:48,780 --> 03:04:49,080
Okay!

4492
03:04:49,380 --> 03:04:49,580
Okay!

4493
03:04:50,240 --> 03:04:50,780
I'm going!

4494
03:04:50,980 --> 03:04:51,320
I'm going!

4495
03:04:51,320 --> 03:04:54,840
It's already night time again.

4496
03:04:55,040 --> 03:04:55,320
Crazy.

4497
03:04:58,100 --> 03:04:59,720
Get moving!

4498
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:01,340
I...

4499
03:05:01,340 --> 03:05:03,360
I'm a lockpicking champion!

4500
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:11,280
Uh, follow me!

4501
03:05:12,100 --> 03:05:13,260
Okay.

4502
03:05:13,820 --> 03:05:14,240
Cool.

4503
03:05:15,140 --> 03:05:16,400
Are you...

4504
03:05:16,820 --> 03:05:17,400
Wait.

4505
03:05:19,180 --> 03:05:20,320
Oh, you, you, you.

4506
03:05:20,820 --> 03:05:23,540
I'm just waiting for Captain Mattias to give the order.

4507
03:05:24,140 --> 03:05:24,620
Finally.

4508
03:05:25,180 --> 03:05:26,300
A chance to fight them!

4509
03:05:26,320 --> 03:05:27,340
The Chads came in.

4510
03:05:28,160 --> 03:05:29,280
Yes, I have it.

4511
03:05:29,440 --> 03:05:29,840
Why?

4512
03:05:30,100 --> 03:05:30,640
Give it to me!

4513
03:05:31,920 --> 03:05:33,360
I needed to get to the...

4514
03:05:33,360 --> 03:05:34,300
Oh, yeah, his orders.

4515
03:05:34,900 --> 03:05:39,980
You do the guard one little favor and suddenly you think you're Mattias' best friend.

4516
03:05:39,980 --> 03:05:42,740
You probably couldn't find it on your own.

4517
03:05:43,060 --> 03:05:44,180
I'm coming with you.

4518
03:05:44,380 --> 03:05:46,720
If we make it, I'll open the door for you.

4519
03:05:46,820 --> 03:05:47,480
Oh, he's jealous.

4520
03:05:48,080 --> 03:05:50,000
I've still got some fight left in me!

4521
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:51,460
Oh!

4522
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:51,840
Oh!

4523
03:05:55,180 --> 03:05:55,640
Okay.

4524
03:05:55,980 --> 03:05:56,700
Is it this one?

4525
03:06:00,080 --> 03:06:01,020
Where did he go?

4526
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:01,800
Wait.

4527
03:06:01,960 --> 03:06:02,600
Where did he go?

4528
03:06:03,380 --> 03:06:04,100
Oh, here.

4529
03:06:04,300 --> 03:06:04,440
Okay.

4530
03:06:07,880 --> 03:06:09,060
He's a little jealous.

4531
03:06:10,180 --> 03:06:11,160
Oh my gosh.

4532
03:06:14,320 --> 03:06:15,580
Oh, yoy, yoy, yoy!

4533
03:06:19,130 --> 03:06:20,230
Remember me!

4534
03:06:25,320 --> 03:06:26,640
Do your worst!

4535
03:06:28,740 --> 03:06:29,840
Hey, hey, hey!

4536
03:06:30,140 --> 03:06:31,560
Watch where you're swinging that thing.

4537
03:06:32,420 --> 03:06:32,860
Gosh.

4538
03:06:34,800 --> 03:06:36,940
You might wanna switch to short sword.

4539
03:06:38,380 --> 03:06:38,980
Maybe.

4540
03:06:40,040 --> 03:06:41,000
Maybe not.

4541
03:06:41,480 --> 03:06:42,100
I don't know.

4542
03:06:43,960 --> 03:06:44,420
Empty.

4543
03:06:44,660 --> 03:06:44,740
Empty.

4544
03:06:44,740 --> 03:06:45,240
It says empty.

4545
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:46,180
I don't know why I click.

4546
03:06:50,040 --> 03:06:50,500
Okay.

4547
03:06:52,760 --> 03:06:54,140
Got your arrows out?

4548
03:06:54,260 --> 03:06:55,000
Yeah, he's ready.

4549
03:06:55,480 --> 03:06:56,600
Okay, so we go...

4550
03:06:57,070 --> 03:06:57,300
This!

4551
03:06:57,900 --> 03:06:58,640
This way.

4552
03:06:59,120 --> 03:06:59,620
Hold on.

4553
03:06:59,740 --> 03:07:01,120
This is my first time coming down here.

4554
03:07:03,800 --> 03:07:04,860
Are those bones?

4555
03:07:05,740 --> 03:07:06,880
I think they're rocks.

4556
03:07:08,760 --> 03:07:10,560
I thought you had some fight left in you, buddy.

4557
03:07:12,720 --> 03:07:14,280
Yeah, who needs a short sword?

4558
03:07:18,260 --> 03:07:18,660
Oh!

4559
03:07:19,400 --> 03:07:22,860
This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death!

4560
03:07:23,220 --> 03:07:24,480
That the best you can do?

4561
03:07:24,640 --> 03:07:24,840
Oops.

4562
03:07:25,320 --> 03:07:25,700
Oh, gosh.

4563
03:07:25,900 --> 03:07:26,360
Oh, golly.

4564
03:07:27,160 --> 03:07:28,620
They can't see me at all.

4565
03:07:28,860 --> 03:07:29,140
Hahaha!

4566
03:07:30,520 --> 03:07:33,080
I thought mud crabs were fearsome than you.

4567
03:07:33,280 --> 03:07:35,820
I thought mud crabs were fearsome.

4568
03:07:35,920 --> 03:07:37,020
I love that I'm...

4569
03:07:37,020 --> 03:07:39,460
I'm crouched, so I'm like...

4570
03:07:40,060 --> 03:07:41,260
Giving more damage.

4571
03:07:41,580 --> 03:07:41,780
Wait.

4572
03:07:42,040 --> 03:07:42,600
Oh, my gosh.

4573
03:07:42,700 --> 03:07:43,280
I can't...

4574
03:07:43,280 --> 03:07:44,540
I literally can't hit anything.

4575
03:07:45,040 --> 03:07:46,640
I'm so bad at this.

4576
03:07:47,400 --> 03:07:47,880
Hahaha!

4577
03:07:48,960 --> 03:07:51,120
I'm so stealthy, they run away from...

4578
03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:52,480
They just run around me.

4579
03:07:53,720 --> 03:07:54,280
More?

4580
03:07:54,280 --> 03:07:54,320
More?

4581
03:07:57,420 --> 03:07:58,320
You got him?

4582
03:07:58,520 --> 03:07:59,260
Oh, no you don't.

4583
03:08:05,860 --> 03:08:06,660
You okay?

4584
03:08:10,240 --> 03:08:11,180
Just a...

4585
03:08:11,180 --> 03:08:12,380
Just a little bit of a burn.

4586
03:08:18,440 --> 03:08:20,380
I'm trying to get the arrows back.

4587
03:08:20,820 --> 03:08:22,700
This guy dropped steel arrows.

4588
03:08:22,720 --> 03:08:23,340
He's great.

4589
03:08:24,680 --> 03:08:25,480
Iron arrow.

4590
03:08:25,640 --> 03:08:26,560
You know who hit that one.

4591
03:08:26,720 --> 03:08:27,080
Hahaha!

4592
03:08:29,480 --> 03:08:31,080
You know who hit that one.

4593
03:08:31,320 --> 03:08:31,540
Okay.

4594
03:08:31,960 --> 03:08:32,540
Let's go.

4595
03:08:34,220 --> 03:08:35,440
For the emperor!

4596
03:08:36,740 --> 03:08:40,160
But I kinda wanna, like, take the stuff from the homes, you know?

4597
03:08:43,960 --> 03:08:44,460
Okay.

4598
03:08:44,800 --> 03:08:45,400
Okay, he's okay.

4599
03:08:47,060 --> 03:08:48,500
He's ignoring us completely.

4600
03:08:50,100 --> 03:08:50,500
Oh.

4601
03:08:50,700 --> 03:08:51,180
I said empty.

4602
03:08:51,380 --> 03:08:51,620
My bad.

4603
03:08:54,480 --> 03:08:54,880
For...

4604
03:08:55,380 --> 03:08:55,940
Hold on.

4605
03:08:56,040 --> 03:08:56,480
Let me get it.

4606
03:08:58,660 --> 03:08:59,060
Oh.

4607
03:08:59,240 --> 03:08:59,600
Oopsie!

4608
03:08:59,840 --> 03:09:00,240
Sorry!

4609
03:09:04,530 --> 03:09:04,930
Sorry!

4610
03:09:05,850 --> 03:09:06,530
Oh, my God.

4611
03:09:11,890 --> 03:09:13,650
I accidentally hit...

4612
03:09:13,650 --> 03:09:14,810
Uh, friendly fire.

4613
03:09:15,190 --> 03:09:15,810
Are you okay?

4614
03:09:17,670 --> 03:09:19,490
I accidentally friendly fired him.

4615
03:09:20,890 --> 03:09:21,290
But...

4616
03:09:22,050 --> 03:09:23,010
Let's take all of it.

4617
03:09:23,070 --> 03:09:23,690
I actually...

4618
03:09:23,690 --> 03:09:25,150
Maybe I should let them do all the work.

4619
03:09:25,270 --> 03:09:27,150
Because then I can take all their steel arrows.

4620
03:09:29,130 --> 03:09:30,330
Free arrows, baby.

4621
03:09:32,130 --> 03:09:32,810
Oh.

4622
03:09:36,610 --> 03:09:37,290
Whoa!

4623
03:09:56,760 --> 03:09:58,120
Hey, team?

4624
03:09:58,780 --> 03:10:00,580
Aren't we just such a good team?

4625
03:10:02,260 --> 03:10:03,660
Deidre running away.

4626
03:10:03,940 --> 03:10:05,900
I know, they're such cowardly...

4627
03:10:06,640 --> 03:10:07,220
Oh, wow.

4628
03:10:07,220 --> 03:10:07,220
Oh!

4629
03:10:08,380 --> 03:10:09,860
Flawless Pearl!

4630
03:10:13,180 --> 03:10:15,360
I've got so many potions.

4631
03:10:15,360 --> 03:10:20,620
I should use... I should... I should use them... eventually.

4632
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:23,140
At some point.

4633
03:10:25,820 --> 03:10:27,680
How much further is it?

4634
03:10:27,740 --> 03:10:28,320
Oh, it's over here?

4635
03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:32,200
This is it?

4636
03:10:32,520 --> 03:10:33,320
That it?

4637
03:10:33,860 --> 03:10:35,220
The passageway?

4638
03:10:38,840 --> 03:10:39,880
Potion seller.

4639
03:10:41,020 --> 03:10:43,480
I'm gonna become the potion seller at this point.

4640
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:48,580
Hold on, hold on.

4641
03:10:48,780 --> 03:10:49,840
I wanna see what's over here.

4642
03:10:53,080 --> 03:10:53,720
Oh.

4643
03:10:54,120 --> 03:10:55,300
Wait, over...

4644
03:10:56,040 --> 03:10:56,540
Oh!

4645
03:10:59,100 --> 03:11:01,320
Oh, I forgot to...

4646
03:11:01,320 --> 03:11:02,360
Thank you!

4647
03:11:04,200 --> 03:11:05,480
I forgot to crouch.

4648
03:11:07,440 --> 03:11:08,560
Was this...

4649
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:10,020
Where I wanted to go see?

4650
03:11:10,180 --> 03:11:11,160
Actually, I'm so lost.

4651
03:11:13,180 --> 03:11:14,320
Guys, I'm lost.

4652
03:11:16,540 --> 03:11:17,780
Wait, we can...

4653
03:11:18,540 --> 03:11:19,420
You know what?

4654
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:21,020
Let's... go.

4655
03:11:21,240 --> 03:11:21,980
Let's go in.

4656
03:11:22,320 --> 03:11:23,420
Let's... let's just...

4657
03:11:25,560 --> 03:11:26,080
Uh...

4658
03:11:26,080 --> 03:11:27,600
We came from...

4659
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:28,600
This way.

4660
03:11:28,960 --> 03:11:31,220
Yeah, so this is where I wanted to...

4661
03:11:31,220 --> 03:11:31,480
Look.

4662
03:11:31,720 --> 03:11:32,480
And I looked.

4663
03:11:32,900 --> 03:11:34,380
Now we can go down the hatch.

4664
03:11:37,420 --> 03:11:37,940
Oh.

4665
03:11:38,260 --> 03:11:38,780
Hello?

4666
03:11:39,100 --> 03:11:39,560
This is it.

4667
03:11:39,760 --> 03:11:41,640
The entrance to the passage is right here.

4668
03:11:41,920 --> 03:11:42,940
I'll unlock it for you.

4669
03:11:42,940 --> 03:11:44,300
Best of luck.

4670
03:11:44,300 --> 03:11:44,860
Bag for him.

4671
03:11:46,780 --> 03:11:47,580
You got it?

4672
03:11:47,800 --> 03:11:48,260
Oh, thank you.

4673
03:11:51,180 --> 03:11:52,220
Down the hatch.

4674
03:11:52,720 --> 03:11:52,740
Oh.

4675
03:11:53,540 --> 03:11:55,200
I found the tunnel entrance in Kvatch.

4676
03:11:55,340 --> 03:11:59,440
I need to follow it to the gatehouse so I can raise the gates and let the guards into the castle port yard.

4677
03:12:01,100 --> 03:12:02,780
Oh, all my friends are still here though.

4678
03:12:03,560 --> 03:12:04,000
Awesome.

4679
03:12:05,420 --> 03:12:06,500
Alright, guys.

4680
03:12:06,940 --> 03:12:07,620
What is this?

4681
03:12:09,180 --> 03:12:09,940
Oh, okay.

4682
03:12:10,760 --> 03:12:12,140
It's a little smoky.

4683
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:13,820
Don't fall into the fire.

4684
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:14,780
Please.

4685
03:12:15,100 --> 03:12:16,760
Actually, don't fall into the fire.

4686
03:12:17,080 --> 03:12:17,820
Don't do that.

4687
03:12:23,230 --> 03:12:23,830
Okay.

4688
03:12:24,350 --> 03:12:25,730
So far, so good.

4689
03:12:31,310 --> 03:12:32,070
That's it?

4690
03:12:32,770 --> 03:12:33,190
Wait.

4691
03:12:33,790 --> 03:12:34,390
Ah!

4692
03:12:34,630 --> 03:12:34,890
Oh!

4693
03:12:35,050 --> 03:12:35,530
That's it?

4694
03:12:36,870 --> 03:12:37,670
We good?

4695
03:12:37,830 --> 03:12:38,030
Okay.

4696
03:12:41,660 --> 03:12:42,480
Let's go.

4697
03:12:43,140 --> 03:12:43,620
Why?

4698
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:44,500
You get the loot.

4699
03:12:44,640 --> 03:12:45,600
If they die!

4700
03:12:48,300 --> 03:12:49,560
They're my buddies now.

4701
03:12:49,760 --> 03:12:50,800
It's not just about...

4702
03:12:50,800 --> 03:12:51,040
Oh.

4703
03:12:52,220 --> 03:12:53,980
It's not just about...

4704
03:12:53,980 --> 03:12:54,360
Oh.

4705
03:12:54,560 --> 03:12:54,840
Oh.

4706
03:12:55,080 --> 03:12:55,360
Oh.

4707
03:12:55,920 --> 03:12:56,260
Oh!

4708
03:12:56,300 --> 03:12:57,100
Hello, friends.

4709
03:12:59,080 --> 03:13:00,380
I'll let them handle it.

4710
03:13:11,890 --> 03:13:12,790
Oh, I got him.

4711
03:13:12,870 --> 03:13:13,250
I got him.

4712
03:13:14,070 --> 03:13:14,950
Oh, my God.

4713
03:13:15,730 --> 03:13:16,630
Oh, my God.

4714
03:13:19,720 --> 03:13:21,140
It's a lizard galore.

4715
03:13:21,140 --> 03:13:22,100
Oh!

4716
03:13:25,220 --> 03:13:25,820
Oh, uh...

4717
03:13:25,820 --> 03:13:27,080
That's the best you can do!

4718
03:13:33,120 --> 03:13:33,300
Oh!

4719
03:13:33,560 --> 03:13:34,060
Hello.

4720
03:13:39,020 --> 03:13:40,000
No, I got him.

4721
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:40,820
Oh!

4722
03:13:41,020 --> 03:13:41,280
Oh!

4723
03:13:51,080 --> 03:13:52,460
How many people died?

4724
03:13:58,160 --> 03:13:59,020
Oh, no!

4725
03:13:59,600 --> 03:14:00,120
Jessen!

4726
03:14:01,420 --> 03:14:02,460
Oh, Jessen!

4727
03:14:02,900 --> 03:14:04,420
Oh, Jessen!

4728
03:14:04,740 --> 03:14:04,900
Oh, Jessen!

4729
03:14:04,900 --> 03:14:05,420
Jessen, no!

4730
03:14:07,480 --> 03:14:08,000
Oh!

4731
03:14:09,300 --> 03:14:11,120
I told you guys.

4732
03:14:12,200 --> 03:14:12,920
Oh!

4733
03:14:12,920 --> 03:14:13,180
I told you guys.

4734
03:14:15,080 --> 03:14:16,460
I told you guys.

4735
03:14:16,720 --> 03:14:17,980
It was a death flash.

4736
03:14:25,980 --> 03:14:27,420
Oh, buddy.

4737
03:14:28,160 --> 03:14:29,260
Oh, my gosh.

4738
03:14:29,780 --> 03:14:31,360
So many fallen.

4739
03:14:32,020 --> 03:14:32,120
Oh!

4740
03:14:33,160 --> 03:14:33,500
Yes!

4741
03:14:33,500 --> 03:14:37,160
Thank you, but it's not in vain.

4742
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:39,720
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, ew.

4743
03:14:40,440 --> 03:14:40,840
Yeah, yeah.

4744
03:14:41,720 --> 03:14:43,060
Oh, oh, it's empty.

4745
03:14:45,080 --> 03:14:47,500
Oh, your sacrifice is not in vain.

4746
03:14:49,760 --> 03:14:53,480
Yes, yes, thank you, thank you.

4747
03:14:59,530 --> 03:15:00,050
Oh,

4748
03:15:12,620 --> 03:15:13,580
I'll take that.

4749
03:15:16,280 --> 03:15:17,200
Okay.

4750
03:15:18,120 --> 03:15:19,220
Let's go talk.

4751
03:15:25,540 --> 03:15:26,960
Yes, we did.

4752
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:33,660
Is this not the courtyard, or...

4753
03:15:34,200 --> 03:15:35,220
Oh, great hall.

4754
03:15:39,060 --> 03:15:39,980
Okay.

4755
03:15:40,480 --> 03:15:41,400
Uh...

4756
03:15:42,920 --> 03:15:43,840
Uh...

4757
03:15:45,100 --> 03:15:46,480
This part's a bit bugged.

4758
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:47,840
Just enter the castle and get the...

4759
03:15:47,840 --> 03:15:48,600
Oh, get the ring?

4760
03:15:48,800 --> 03:15:49,120
Okay.

4761
03:15:49,800 --> 03:15:50,600
It's bugged.

4762
03:15:50,700 --> 03:15:51,720
Go in and get a ring.

4763
03:15:51,860 --> 03:15:52,020
Okay.

4764
03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:04,740
What the heck is that...

4765
03:16:05,520 --> 03:16:06,720
That thing up there?

4766
03:16:10,580 --> 03:16:12,120
Oh, at least my friend's in here, though.

4767
03:16:12,980 --> 03:16:13,300
Nice.

4768
03:16:17,720 --> 03:16:18,360
Spicy lady.

4769
03:16:20,220 --> 03:16:20,840
Wait, hold on.

4770
03:16:20,860 --> 03:16:21,540
I heard something.

4771
03:16:21,660 --> 03:16:22,160
Oh, here it is.

4772
03:16:23,100 --> 03:16:23,260
Oh!

4773
03:16:26,400 --> 03:16:27,460
Yeah, get his ass.

4774
03:16:29,380 --> 03:16:31,120
Uh-oh, I think my friend is about to die.

4775
03:16:33,560 --> 03:16:34,680
Oh, nice.

4776
03:16:35,860 --> 03:16:36,880
Good job, friend.

4777
03:16:37,780 --> 03:16:40,680
I'm going to switch out for steel arrows.

4778
03:16:43,580 --> 03:16:45,100
Hot lady up ahead.

4779
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:48,780
Should I, like, try and snipe her, or...

4780
03:16:48,780 --> 03:16:49,740
Should we...

4781
03:16:56,270 --> 03:16:57,730
Go talk to her.

4782
03:16:59,670 --> 03:17:01,010
Oh, there's another one!

4783
03:17:08,620 --> 03:17:09,320
Oh, my God.

4784
03:17:10,240 --> 03:17:11,580
I don't think she wants to talk.

4785
03:17:13,960 --> 03:17:14,400
Nice!

4786
03:17:16,500 --> 03:17:17,300
Too hot.

4787
03:17:19,060 --> 03:17:20,260
Go have a chat.

4788
03:17:21,140 --> 03:17:22,440
All right, let's go have a chat.

4789
03:17:23,900 --> 03:17:24,780
Oh, madam!

4790
03:17:24,900 --> 03:17:27,020
Your fair hair is so...

4791
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:29,220
Oh, damn, she is...

4792
03:17:29,220 --> 03:17:29,700
Oh, my God!

4793
03:17:29,740 --> 03:17:30,440
Where did you come from?

4794
03:17:32,440 --> 03:17:32,920
He's...

4795
03:17:32,920 --> 03:17:34,080
He's scampering.

4796
03:17:34,900 --> 03:17:35,520
Uh-oh.

4797
03:17:36,040 --> 03:17:36,940
Oh, no!

4798
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:38,020
He's literally a scamp!

4799
03:17:43,320 --> 03:17:44,740
It's literally in his name!

4800
03:17:53,660 --> 03:17:54,820
He's like, No, m'lady!

4801
03:17:55,120 --> 03:17:55,660
Oh, my God.

4802
03:17:55,700 --> 03:17:56,260
She's so beautiful.

4803
03:17:58,920 --> 03:17:59,720
What's she got?

4804
03:17:59,860 --> 03:18:00,620
Fire salts.

4805
03:18:01,060 --> 03:18:01,240
Okay.

4806
03:18:05,560 --> 03:18:06,640
Nah, take it on.

4807
03:18:08,580 --> 03:18:09,860
Aw, my buddy!

4808
03:18:12,260 --> 03:18:13,820
We lost him, my buddy.

4809
03:18:26,310 --> 03:18:27,770
It's all so heavy, though.

4810
03:18:30,290 --> 03:18:31,690
I don't think...

4811
03:18:31,690 --> 03:18:33,670
Anybody is alive in here.

4812
03:18:34,870 --> 03:18:37,230
I think it's not doing so good.

4813
03:18:37,550 --> 03:18:40,230
I think if anybody was still in here...

4814
03:18:40,230 --> 03:18:41,710
It's kind of...

4815
03:18:41,710 --> 03:18:42,570
Looking rough.

4816
03:18:45,290 --> 03:18:46,730
I think it's looking...

4817
03:18:46,730 --> 03:18:46,810
Oh.

4818
03:18:49,050 --> 03:18:50,330
It's my...

4819
03:18:50,330 --> 03:18:51,970
My castle now!

4820
03:18:54,090 --> 03:18:56,050
This place has seen better days.

4821
03:18:56,050 --> 03:18:56,630
Absolutely.

4822
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:03,980
They didn't even barricade the door.

4823
03:19:04,720 --> 03:19:05,440
Oh, my God.

4824
03:19:06,400 --> 03:19:07,100
Shoot.

4825
03:19:07,480 --> 03:19:08,380
Wait, where's my...

4826
03:19:08,380 --> 03:19:08,860
There it is.

4827
03:19:10,580 --> 03:19:11,970
Oh, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

4828
03:19:15,220 --> 03:19:15,760
Ugh.

4829
03:19:16,480 --> 03:19:17,020
Please.

4830
03:19:20,970 --> 03:19:21,710
Oh, yeah.

4831
03:19:22,330 --> 03:19:23,290
Nobody's alive here.

4832
03:19:26,130 --> 03:19:27,870
He ate some of my arrows.

4833
03:19:29,630 --> 03:19:31,450
He ate some of my arrows.

4834
03:19:33,610 --> 03:19:35,870
He ate some of my arrows.

4835
03:19:36,290 --> 03:19:36,690
Silver.

4836
03:19:36,690 --> 03:19:36,750
Silver.

4837
03:19:40,780 --> 03:19:41,760
Anyone else in here?

4838
03:19:43,880 --> 03:19:44,640
Most likely.

4839
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:46,900
Okay, so I'm looking for a ring.

4840
03:19:49,380 --> 03:19:49,780
Pumpkin.

4841
03:19:51,100 --> 03:19:52,180
I'm looking for a ring.

4842
03:19:58,270 --> 03:19:58,930
Oh, my gosh.

4843
03:20:02,430 --> 03:20:04,410
Dang it, I was supposed to be stealthy!

4844
03:20:05,610 --> 03:20:06,010
Oops.

4845
03:20:10,260 --> 03:20:11,060
Ugh.

4846
03:20:13,660 --> 03:20:14,460
Please.

4847
03:20:14,760 --> 03:20:15,500
Die.

4848
03:20:17,100 --> 03:20:18,600
Furthest back room.

4849
03:20:18,920 --> 03:20:19,220
Okay.

4850
03:20:21,620 --> 03:20:23,360
I don't want his skin.

4851
03:20:31,680 --> 03:20:33,020
Oh, come on!

4852
03:20:39,340 --> 03:20:40,140
Stink.

4853
03:20:41,500 --> 03:20:42,300
Stink.

4854
03:20:44,560 --> 03:20:45,800
Fun streamer.

4855
03:20:46,060 --> 03:20:48,580
I really want to see the assassination, though.

4856
03:20:48,760 --> 03:20:49,420
Hopefully soon.

4857
03:20:49,420 --> 03:20:49,800
Oh.

4858
03:20:50,700 --> 03:20:51,380
Uh.

4859
03:20:52,420 --> 03:20:55,420
I mean, I'm a higher level now, so...

4860
03:20:58,060 --> 03:20:59,800
We might be able to.

4861
03:21:00,620 --> 03:21:01,300
Really?

4862
03:21:02,820 --> 03:21:03,500
Oh.

4863
03:21:03,840 --> 03:21:04,960
Sexy lady.

4864
03:21:05,700 --> 03:21:06,600
Don't leave.

4865
03:21:06,860 --> 03:21:07,180
No.

4866
03:21:07,920 --> 03:21:09,840
Why do the sexy ones always leave?

4867
03:21:12,160 --> 03:21:13,180
Okay, hold on.

4868
03:21:14,500 --> 03:21:16,800
Am I actually probably strong enough, you think?

4869
03:21:17,640 --> 03:21:18,920
Sexy lady.

4870
03:21:19,680 --> 03:21:20,820
If I...

4871
03:21:20,820 --> 03:21:21,300
If I...

4872
03:21:21,300 --> 03:21:22,680
Serenade you...

4873
03:21:22,680 --> 03:21:23,000
Will you...

4874
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:23,740
Look at my hands.

4875
03:21:23,920 --> 03:21:25,020
Itina is shaking.

4876
03:21:25,560 --> 03:21:26,820
She's so terrified.

4877
03:21:27,520 --> 03:21:27,640
Oh!

4878
03:21:29,440 --> 03:21:30,540
Like that.

4879
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:39,240
Shaking like a little leaf.

4880
03:21:47,480 --> 03:21:47,920
Oh, no.

4881
03:21:49,340 --> 03:21:50,680
Not the art.

4882
03:21:52,880 --> 03:21:54,440
Okay, nothing over here.

4883
03:21:56,560 --> 03:21:58,500
Oh, hail Queen Minto.

4884
03:22:01,560 --> 03:22:03,240
Oh my gosh, she's really gone.

4885
03:22:04,060 --> 03:22:05,980
A less rude song.

4886
03:22:06,440 --> 03:22:07,720
Fundaments of Alchemy.

4887
03:22:08,500 --> 03:22:09,900
Galarian the Mystic.

4888
03:22:11,480 --> 03:22:12,360
Okay, guys.

4889
03:22:12,440 --> 03:22:13,220
I think she's gone.

4890
03:22:27,540 --> 03:22:29,980
She's not gone, but you know what I mean.

4891
03:22:30,920 --> 03:22:32,480
I don't think she's coming back.

4892
03:22:32,780 --> 03:22:33,860
Is what I mean.

4893
03:22:35,780 --> 03:22:36,340
Damn it!

4894
03:22:36,920 --> 03:22:37,120
No!

4895
03:22:39,640 --> 03:22:40,200
Leave!

4896
03:22:40,980 --> 03:22:41,280
Ouch.

4897
03:22:46,660 --> 03:22:48,140
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

4898
03:22:49,240 --> 03:22:51,160
One more, one more, one more.

4899
03:22:52,360 --> 03:22:53,440
We're too good.

4900
03:22:56,960 --> 03:22:58,020
We're too good.

4901
03:23:02,290 --> 03:23:03,430
What's in the cupboard?

4902
03:23:04,330 --> 03:23:05,290
Ooh, lots of wine.

4903
03:23:05,490 --> 03:23:06,770
You think they got that from...

4904
03:23:08,410 --> 03:23:09,490
From, uh...

4905
03:23:09,490 --> 03:23:10,310
The vineyards?

4906
03:23:14,650 --> 03:23:15,190
Alright.

4907
03:23:15,630 --> 03:23:17,810
I don't think anybody's alive in here.

4908
03:23:18,750 --> 03:23:19,290
Maybe...

4909
03:23:19,290 --> 03:23:19,870
An imp.

4910
03:23:20,230 --> 03:23:20,350
Yep.

4911
03:23:24,490 --> 03:23:25,250
Oh my gosh.

4912
03:23:25,350 --> 03:23:25,990
I can't see!

4913
03:23:26,210 --> 03:23:26,640
I can't...

4914
03:23:38,130 --> 03:23:39,690
I need a break.

4915
03:23:39,690 --> 03:23:41,250
I'm-a-tire.

4916
03:23:43,090 --> 03:23:44,470
What's in the drawers?

4917
03:23:44,910 --> 03:23:46,570
Okay, you're telling me this is a king?

4918
03:23:48,070 --> 03:23:50,150
And he has nothing...

4919
03:23:50,150 --> 03:23:51,650
Nothing of value in here?

4920
03:23:52,110 --> 03:23:52,790
Oranges?

4921
03:23:53,270 --> 03:23:53,930
Quills?

4922
03:23:54,510 --> 03:23:55,730
What is this?

4923
03:23:56,810 --> 03:23:57,190
Ooh.

4924
03:23:59,030 --> 03:24:01,670
I found the body of Count Goldwine.

4925
03:24:02,370 --> 03:24:03,050
Goldwine!

4926
03:24:03,330 --> 03:24:07,090
I should deliver his signet ring to Salvian.

4927
03:24:07,990 --> 03:24:08,470
Yeah.

4928
03:24:09,690 --> 03:24:10,650
Wait, what was that?

4929
03:24:11,350 --> 03:24:12,430
Wait, what just happened?

4930
03:24:12,630 --> 03:24:13,090
Oh, yes.

4931
03:24:16,090 --> 03:24:17,390
I could take his outfit.

4932
03:24:17,770 --> 03:24:19,230
Why is his outfit worth nothing?

4933
03:24:20,110 --> 03:24:22,970
They don't want the clothes of a king?

4934
03:24:25,590 --> 03:24:26,030
Scampi.

4935
03:24:28,990 --> 03:24:30,010
That was...

4936
03:24:30,010 --> 03:24:31,190
Oh, I pressed R!

4937
03:24:31,510 --> 03:24:31,670
Ow!

4938
03:24:32,070 --> 03:24:33,510
I forgot that this was a thing.

4939
03:24:33,770 --> 03:24:34,590
Oh my gosh.

4940
03:24:35,010 --> 03:24:36,610
I feel like I have to redo the tutorial.

4941
03:24:37,590 --> 03:24:40,270
I'll take that, and that, and that.

4942
03:24:44,430 --> 03:24:45,970
He keeps his little gold...

4943
03:24:47,270 --> 03:24:48,270
Just around.

4944
03:24:48,890 --> 03:24:50,530
I could sleep here.

4945
03:24:51,230 --> 03:24:52,310
Might be a little...

4946
03:24:53,990 --> 03:24:55,530
A little, uh...

4947
03:24:55,530 --> 03:24:56,630
I think I would...

4948
03:24:56,630 --> 03:24:57,370
Maybe...

4949
03:24:57,370 --> 03:24:58,610
The smoke inhalation...

4950
03:24:58,610 --> 03:24:59,890
Actually, the smoke inhalation?

4951
03:25:00,050 --> 03:25:01,570
How have we not died from that?

4952
03:25:03,350 --> 03:25:04,750
Now that I think about it.

4953
03:25:05,630 --> 03:25:07,030
There's so much in here.

4954
03:25:12,760 --> 03:25:13,300
Hold on.

4955
03:25:13,520 --> 03:25:14,460
Let's check the other area.

4956
03:25:14,600 --> 03:25:14,880
Oh, wait.

4957
03:25:14,960 --> 03:25:15,920
I think this is a dead end.

4958
03:25:23,320 --> 03:25:25,120
I think we've searched everything.

4959
03:25:25,780 --> 03:25:26,760
Eee, Tina.

4960
03:25:31,230 --> 03:25:32,610
She's too powerful.

4961
03:25:37,480 --> 03:25:38,000
Hup.

4962
03:25:38,720 --> 03:25:39,320
Hup.

4963
03:25:42,800 --> 03:25:43,520
Nice.

4964
03:25:48,940 --> 03:25:50,040
I'm sorry.

4965
03:25:50,660 --> 03:25:51,400
Where is the count?

4966
03:25:51,700 --> 03:25:53,140
Why is he not with you?

4967
03:25:54,880 --> 03:25:55,600
Uh...

4968
03:25:55,600 --> 03:25:58,640
Lying face down in a pool of blood!

4969
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:00,000
I'm sorry.

4970
03:26:00,640 --> 03:26:01,980
Yeah, I'll be dramatic about it.

4971
03:26:02,360 --> 03:26:03,600
How dare you mock him?

4972
03:26:03,680 --> 03:26:03,840
Oh!

4973
03:26:04,080 --> 03:26:04,680
Even in death!

4974
03:26:04,900 --> 03:26:05,140
Sorry.

4975
03:26:05,360 --> 03:26:10,000
Had you not been instrumental in getting this far, I'd put you down where you stand.

4976
03:26:10,600 --> 03:26:11,960
Where is the count's ring?

4977
03:26:12,160 --> 03:26:13,000
Do you have it?

4978
03:26:13,180 --> 03:26:13,600
Sorry.

4979
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:16,900
Yeah, yeah.

4980
03:26:17,280 --> 03:26:18,760
At least, this is safe.

4981
03:26:19,640 --> 03:26:20,280
Thank you.

4982
03:26:20,520 --> 03:26:22,020
I shall make sure it is protected.

4983
03:26:22,400 --> 03:26:25,320
For the time when a new count is crowned.

4984
03:26:25,740 --> 03:26:26,060
Here.

4985
03:26:26,780 --> 03:26:27,560
Take this.

4986
03:26:28,040 --> 03:26:29,400
I have no use for it.

4987
03:26:29,920 --> 03:26:31,160
I'm tired of fighting.

4988
03:26:32,040 --> 03:26:33,720
It may serve you well and base the count.

4989
03:26:33,720 --> 03:26:34,700
Damn, Minto is so insensitive.

4990
03:26:35,660 --> 03:26:35,740
Oh!

4991
03:26:36,040 --> 03:26:36,640
I took it.

4992
03:26:36,720 --> 03:26:38,660
He gave me his clothes.

4993
03:26:39,420 --> 03:26:40,740
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4994
03:26:42,320 --> 03:26:42,700
Thanks!

4995
03:26:43,440 --> 03:26:44,920
He should be around the camp somewhere.

4996
03:26:45,240 --> 03:26:48,720
He was with the survivors we rescued from the Chapel of Akatosh.

4997
03:26:50,080 --> 03:26:52,800
He literally gave me the clothes off his back.

4998
03:26:53,380 --> 03:26:53,680
Goodbye.

4999
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:53,740
Goodbye.

5000
03:26:55,680 --> 03:26:56,940
We did it!

5001
03:26:57,400 --> 03:26:58,120
We did it!

5002
03:26:58,740 --> 03:26:59,380
Mirandil.

5003
03:26:59,620 --> 03:27:00,320
It's my pleasure.

5004
03:27:00,560 --> 03:27:01,500
Please continue.

5005
03:27:02,720 --> 03:27:03,320
Yes.

5006
03:27:03,660 --> 03:27:04,980
Actually, it's your pleasure.

5007
03:27:05,180 --> 03:27:05,860
What's our...

5008
03:27:05,860 --> 03:27:06,540
81!

5009
03:27:06,540 --> 03:27:07,960
He really likes me.

5010
03:27:08,280 --> 03:27:08,840
Take care.

5011
03:27:09,080 --> 03:27:09,640
Yeah, you too.

5012
03:27:09,940 --> 03:27:10,240
Bye!

5013
03:27:13,320 --> 03:27:15,240
We took back the city!

5014
03:27:16,320 --> 03:27:16,960
Woohoo!

5015
03:27:18,920 --> 03:27:20,280
And, uh...

5016
03:27:20,280 --> 03:27:22,200
Can I go this way, or...

5017
03:27:22,200 --> 03:27:23,540
Which...

5018
03:27:25,380 --> 03:27:26,060
Uh...

5019
03:27:28,540 --> 03:27:29,220
Uh...

5020
03:27:29,220 --> 03:27:30,680
Or was it...

5021
03:27:30,680 --> 03:27:31,620
Uh, this way?

5022
03:27:34,440 --> 03:27:35,320
Oh, yes.

5023
03:27:35,320 --> 03:27:36,000
It was this one.

5024
03:27:37,800 --> 03:27:39,900
The hero of Kvatch.

5025
03:27:40,920 --> 03:27:41,840
That's me.

5026
03:27:45,060 --> 03:27:46,380
That's me, all right.

5027
03:27:46,740 --> 03:27:47,560
I did it.

5028
03:27:48,040 --> 03:27:48,540
Good day.

5029
03:27:49,340 --> 03:27:50,540
Yeah, I did it.

5030
03:27:50,920 --> 03:27:51,820
Never mind, you don't care.

5031
03:27:52,020 --> 03:27:52,620
Good day.

5032
03:27:52,880 --> 03:27:53,380
Ha ha ha!

5033
03:27:53,820 --> 03:27:54,600
Good day.

5034
03:27:55,540 --> 03:27:56,500
Good day.

5035
03:27:57,620 --> 03:27:58,580
Good day.

5036
03:27:59,500 --> 03:28:00,200
Good day.

5037
03:28:00,300 --> 03:28:01,100
Try on his armor.

5038
03:28:01,320 --> 03:28:01,640
Oh, yeah.

5039
03:28:01,800 --> 03:28:02,100
We got him.

5040
03:28:04,260 --> 03:28:05,580
It smells just like him.

5041
03:28:08,060 --> 03:28:08,780
This one?

5042
03:28:10,040 --> 03:28:10,520
Oh!

5043
03:28:10,520 --> 03:28:12,820
Oh, it's enchanted with...

5044
03:28:14,340 --> 03:28:15,060
Mystery!

5045
03:28:15,760 --> 03:28:16,720
Ha ha ha!

5046
03:28:18,520 --> 03:28:19,680
Good day.

5047
03:28:20,460 --> 03:28:21,560
Good day.

5048
03:28:26,080 --> 03:28:27,340
Look at the value.

5049
03:28:27,480 --> 03:28:28,520
Wait, I didn't look at the value.

5050
03:28:29,040 --> 03:28:30,580
Oh, H for details.

5051
03:28:30,800 --> 03:28:31,280
Thank you, guys.

5052
03:28:33,080 --> 03:28:33,760
Heetails.

5053
03:28:40,640 --> 03:28:41,360
Enchanted...

5054
03:28:42,740 --> 03:28:43,460
With...

5055
03:28:46,250 --> 03:28:46,970
Uh...

5056
03:28:48,510 --> 03:28:51,590
Fortify endurance on self.

5057
03:28:52,170 --> 03:28:54,450
Fortify strength on self.

5058
03:28:58,300 --> 03:28:59,180
Very cool.

5059
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:02,780
Light armor you'll wear degrades at a normal rate.

5060
03:29:03,020 --> 03:29:03,160
Oh.

5061
03:29:03,620 --> 03:29:04,480
Aw, man.

5062
03:29:09,440 --> 03:29:12,600
All right, let's go talk the more time.

5063
03:29:14,360 --> 03:29:15,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5064
03:29:17,740 --> 03:29:18,380
Oh, God.

5065
03:29:18,500 --> 03:29:19,100
I'm getting impaled.

5066
03:29:19,380 --> 03:29:20,040
Okay, we're fine.

5067
03:29:20,700 --> 03:29:20,880
No.

5068
03:29:22,820 --> 03:29:23,300
Ha ha ha ha!

5069
03:29:23,300 --> 03:29:24,160
Some good armor.

5070
03:29:24,800 --> 03:29:26,760
Yeah, we can get rid of the other one.

5071
03:29:28,540 --> 03:29:29,080
We can...

5072
03:29:29,080 --> 03:29:32,400
We can give it to someone else and they can impersonate, uh...

5073
03:29:32,400 --> 03:29:33,400
A, uh...

5074
03:29:34,460 --> 03:29:35,200
A soldier.

5075
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:39,220
My athletics.

5076
03:29:39,460 --> 03:29:40,040
Let's go, baby.

5077
03:29:45,040 --> 03:29:46,900
I think they'll be fine.

5078
03:29:53,010 --> 03:29:54,090
There he is.

5079
03:29:54,270 --> 03:29:54,970
There he is.

5080
03:29:55,150 --> 03:29:56,630
Are they angry with us?

5081
03:29:57,250 --> 03:29:57,830
Hello.

5082
03:29:58,470 --> 03:29:58,590
Hello.

5083
03:30:00,410 --> 03:30:03,070
Let me talk to you.

5084
03:30:08,270 --> 03:30:11,270
Come with me to Wainan Priory.

5085
03:30:12,930 --> 03:30:13,970
Yes!

5086
03:30:14,850 --> 03:30:15,230
Yes!

5087
03:30:17,030 --> 03:30:17,770
Yes!

5088
03:30:18,290 --> 03:30:18,290
Yes!

5089
03:30:19,010 --> 03:30:19,230
Yes!

5090
03:30:19,230 --> 03:30:19,230
Yes!

5091
03:30:19,230 --> 03:30:19,230
Yes!

5092
03:30:23,710 --> 03:30:25,470
Where's my horse?

5093
03:30:25,470 --> 03:30:27,910
What could we have done to deserve this?

5094
03:30:27,930 --> 03:30:29,050
Wait, is he just gonna follow me?

5095
03:30:29,230 --> 03:30:29,850
Oh, nice!

5096
03:30:32,610 --> 03:30:33,050
Um...

5097
03:30:33,050 --> 03:30:34,250
Okay, I have a horse?

5098
03:30:34,270 --> 03:30:35,790
Like, somewhere around here.

5099
03:30:37,590 --> 03:30:38,470
Uh... Oh!

5100
03:30:39,310 --> 03:30:41,110
My horse is so loyal!

5101
03:30:43,370 --> 03:30:44,930
Exactly where we left him!

5102
03:30:45,050 --> 03:30:45,450
Here, here, here.

5103
03:30:46,090 --> 03:30:46,810
Okay, come here.

5104
03:30:47,250 --> 03:30:49,230
This is my horse, my steed.

5105
03:30:49,550 --> 03:30:50,970
My golden steed.

5106
03:30:51,930 --> 03:30:52,730
Now, get on.

5107
03:30:55,270 --> 03:30:55,710
Or...

5108
03:30:55,710 --> 03:30:56,010
Keep up.

5109
03:31:03,130 --> 03:31:04,030
He'll be fine.

5110
03:31:04,430 --> 03:31:05,130
Alright, where are we going?

5111
03:31:05,370 --> 03:31:07,690
Oh, let's make this quest my...

5112
03:31:07,690 --> 03:31:07,910
Uh...

5113
03:31:08,270 --> 03:31:08,730
Oh, it is.

5114
03:31:08,810 --> 03:31:08,930
Okay.

5115
03:31:11,110 --> 03:31:12,750
We are going...

5116
03:31:21,380 --> 03:31:21,820
Uh...

5117
03:31:29,650 --> 03:31:30,090
Coral?

5118
03:31:30,270 --> 03:31:31,290
Oh, yes, a coral.

5119
03:31:33,650 --> 03:31:35,130
There it is!

5120
03:31:35,910 --> 03:31:38,530
Oh my gosh, you guys, it's so...

5121
03:31:38,530 --> 03:31:40,560
It's so far.

5122
03:31:47,830 --> 03:31:49,190
Da-da-da-da!

5123
03:31:50,010 --> 03:31:52,110
With my ghostly powers!

5124
03:31:52,110 --> 03:31:55,570
This is what athletics level 34 gets you.

5125
03:31:56,570 --> 03:31:57,090
Uh-oh.

5126
03:31:57,490 --> 03:31:58,250
Wait, what's happening here?

5127
03:31:59,970 --> 03:32:00,530
Um...

5128
03:32:00,530 --> 03:32:00,810
Oh!

5129
03:32:01,150 --> 03:32:02,210
You must help!

5130
03:32:02,410 --> 03:32:04,670
They're killing everyone at Wayne on Priory!

5131
03:32:05,070 --> 03:32:05,630
What?!

5132
03:32:06,350 --> 03:32:07,730
Hold on, tell me what happened!

5133
03:32:08,210 --> 03:32:08,930
I don't know!

5134
03:32:09,130 --> 03:32:10,350
The guy's right behind you!

5135
03:32:11,030 --> 03:32:12,290
Prior Maberel is dead!

5136
03:32:20,170 --> 03:32:21,910
No kidding, I think they are too!

5137
03:32:22,830 --> 03:32:23,450
I think they're...

5138
03:32:23,450 --> 03:32:25,050
I think they're right behind!

5139
03:32:28,930 --> 03:32:31,010
I was in the sheepfold when they attacked.

5140
03:32:31,250 --> 03:32:33,290
I heard the prior talking to someone.

5141
03:32:33,450 --> 03:32:33,830
Uh-oh.

5142
03:32:34,070 --> 03:32:36,110
Looked around the corner to see who it was.

5143
03:32:36,510 --> 03:32:37,850
They looked like travelers.

5144
03:32:38,330 --> 03:32:38,810
Ordinary.

5145
03:32:39,570 --> 03:32:44,270
Suddenly, weapons appeared in their hands, and they cut the prior down before he could move.

5146
03:32:44,390 --> 03:32:44,990
Oh my god!

5147
03:32:44,990 --> 03:32:47,010
They saw me watching, and I ran.

5148
03:32:47,130 --> 03:32:47,310
Wait!

5149
03:32:47,450 --> 03:32:47,890
He's dead?

5150
03:32:48,690 --> 03:32:49,650
Where's Joffre?

5151
03:32:49,790 --> 03:32:49,890
Yeah.

5152
03:32:50,830 --> 03:32:51,370
I don't know.

5153
03:32:51,630 --> 03:32:53,210
In the chapel, praying, I think.

5154
03:32:53,490 --> 03:32:54,670
You must help us!

5155
03:32:55,390 --> 03:32:55,850
Okay!

5156
03:32:56,230 --> 03:32:56,750
Oh!

5157
03:32:57,190 --> 03:32:57,430
Oh!

5158
03:32:58,750 --> 03:32:59,390
What?

5159
03:33:00,270 --> 03:33:00,910
What?

5160
03:33:00,910 --> 03:33:02,350
What is he saying?!

5161
03:33:02,350 --> 03:33:02,670
Ah!

5162
03:33:05,070 --> 03:33:06,510
Mythic Dawn Agent.

5163
03:33:07,990 --> 03:33:08,630
God!

5164
03:33:09,230 --> 03:33:09,410
God!

5165
03:33:19,350 --> 03:33:20,130
I'm helping!

5166
03:33:21,590 --> 03:33:21,910
God!

5167
03:33:23,830 --> 03:33:24,470
God!

5168
03:33:25,370 --> 03:33:39,690

5169
03:33:40,030 --> 03:33:41,870
Have you seen Grandmaster Joffrey?

5170
03:33:42,210 --> 03:33:42,350
No.

5171
03:33:44,630 --> 03:33:47,210
Uh, Ero Noir said he was in the chapel.

5172
03:33:47,490 --> 03:33:47,710
Quick!

5173
03:33:47,990 --> 03:33:49,350
He may need our help.

5174
03:33:52,630 --> 03:33:54,130
Where is that guy, anyway?

5175
03:33:57,350 --> 03:33:59,090
I thought that was his body for a second.

5176
03:33:59,470 --> 03:34:00,210
Where is he?

5177
03:34:00,430 --> 03:34:01,150
Did he escape?

5178
03:34:06,380 --> 03:34:07,340
Take your gold.

5179
03:34:09,700 --> 03:34:11,780
No, I'm looking for Ero Noir.

5180
03:34:12,700 --> 03:34:14,600
The guy that was going, Quap, quap.

5181
03:34:18,230 --> 03:34:19,490
I can't find him.

5182
03:34:19,770 --> 03:34:20,490
He'll come back later.

5183
03:34:20,670 --> 03:34:20,830
Okay.

5184
03:34:21,190 --> 03:34:21,490
Maybe?

5185
03:34:21,690 --> 03:34:22,390
He ran off.

5186
03:34:22,570 --> 03:34:22,690
Okay.

5187
03:34:23,290 --> 03:34:25,070
That is so funny.

5188
03:34:25,310 --> 03:34:26,290
Your timing is excellent.

5189
03:34:26,570 --> 03:34:27,690
I'll take the one on the right.

5190
03:34:28,170 --> 03:34:28,470
Okay.

5191
03:34:29,010 --> 03:34:30,770
Long burn the dragon fire.

5192
03:34:30,890 --> 03:34:33,070
The time of cleansing is almost here.

5193
03:34:33,250 --> 03:34:33,850
A little closer.

5194
03:34:34,110 --> 03:34:34,390
Oops.

5195
03:34:34,910 --> 03:34:36,390
Wow, I have a great aim.

5196
03:34:36,390 --> 03:34:37,350
Bleed to death.

5197
03:34:38,670 --> 03:34:39,550
Paradise awaits.

5198
03:34:40,450 --> 03:34:41,030
The dark...

5199
03:34:41,030 --> 03:34:41,270
Oh.

5200
03:34:41,570 --> 03:34:41,950
My bad.

5201
03:34:43,530 --> 03:34:44,550
I was a help, too.

5202
03:34:44,710 --> 03:34:46,630
Your back sank, Talos.

5203
03:34:46,750 --> 03:34:48,450
I shot the flower vase.

5204
03:34:48,810 --> 03:34:51,390
I was praying in the chapel when I heard Priam Abarel shout.

5205
03:34:51,630 --> 03:34:53,510
I had just time to arm myself.

5206
03:34:54,070 --> 03:34:55,190
The amulet of kings.

5207
03:34:55,650 --> 03:34:57,670
I fear that was the target of this attack.

5208
03:34:58,110 --> 03:35:00,430
I kept it in a secret room in Wenon House.

5209
03:35:00,810 --> 03:35:02,490
We need to go see if it is safe.

5210
03:35:02,790 --> 03:35:03,230
Okay.

5211
03:35:03,690 --> 03:35:04,830
I'll go check on the amulet.

5212
03:35:04,870 --> 03:35:05,030
Oh, me?

5213
03:35:05,030 --> 03:35:05,650
We'll go together.

5214
03:35:05,830 --> 03:35:06,190
Yes.

5215
03:35:06,370 --> 03:35:07,470
But I fear the worst.

5216
03:35:07,690 --> 03:35:08,050
Oh, no.

5217
03:35:08,510 --> 03:35:09,590
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

5218
03:35:09,690 --> 03:35:10,950
Let me click my...

5219
03:35:10,950 --> 03:35:11,930
I didn't...

5220
03:35:11,930 --> 03:35:13,130
I barely hit anybody.

5221
03:35:15,790 --> 03:35:17,510
Gop, gop, gop, gop, gop.

5222
03:35:23,080 --> 03:35:23,740
You good?

5223
03:35:23,940 --> 03:35:24,300
Let's go.

5224
03:35:25,000 --> 03:35:25,260
Wait.

5225
03:35:38,190 --> 03:35:40,850
I fear the enemy came here for the amulet of kings.

5226
03:35:41,150 --> 03:35:41,410
Oh.

5227
03:35:42,090 --> 03:35:43,830
Look at you with your katana.

5228
03:35:43,830 --> 03:35:43,910
Yeah.

5229
03:35:44,230 --> 03:35:45,690
He's studying the blade.

5230
03:35:48,950 --> 03:35:49,590
He's

5231
03:35:56,720 --> 03:35:56,720
studying the blade.

5232
03:35:56,720 --> 03:35:57,640
Uh-oh.

5233
03:35:58,420 --> 03:36:00,220
I fear we've lost the father.

5234
03:36:00,580 --> 03:36:00,820
Wait.

5235
03:36:01,320 --> 03:36:01,960
Um...

5236
03:36:01,960 --> 03:36:03,960
He came up here and then...

5237
03:36:03,960 --> 03:36:05,180
Oh, he's in here!

5238
03:36:05,620 --> 03:36:05,800
Oh.

5239
03:36:05,800 --> 03:36:06,000
Pull.

5240
03:36:07,920 --> 03:36:08,860
They've taken it!

5241
03:36:08,980 --> 03:36:10,560
The amulet of kings is gone.

5242
03:36:10,780 --> 03:36:12,860
The enemy has defeated us at every turn.

5243
03:36:13,080 --> 03:36:13,380
Ah.

5244
03:36:14,260 --> 03:36:15,440
I found Martin.

5245
03:36:16,060 --> 03:36:17,800
So it has not all gone against us.

5246
03:36:18,260 --> 03:36:19,180
Thank Talos for that.

5247
03:36:19,620 --> 03:36:22,760
We gained Uriel's heir and lost the amulet of kings.

5248
03:36:23,640 --> 03:36:24,900
Martin cannot stay here.

5249
03:36:25,280 --> 03:36:28,500
We have driven them off, but they will be back once they learn of Martin's...

5250
03:36:28,500 --> 03:36:30,160
He really actually has a katana!

5251
03:36:30,360 --> 03:36:30,800
Look at it!

5252
03:36:31,820 --> 03:36:33,300
Where will Martin be safe?

5253
03:36:34,080 --> 03:36:36,920
Nowhere is truly safe against the power arrayed against us.

5254
03:36:37,140 --> 03:36:39,480
But we must play for time at least.

5255
03:36:39,820 --> 03:36:41,300
Cloud Ruler Temple, I think.

5256
03:36:41,940 --> 03:36:43,200
The hidden fortress of the bridge in the mountains.

5257
03:36:43,200 --> 03:36:44,420
Cloud Ruler Temple.

5258
03:36:44,900 --> 03:36:45,000
Okay.

5259
03:36:45,000 --> 03:36:47,020
A few men can hold it against an army.

5260
03:36:47,420 --> 03:36:48,680
We should leave at once.

5261
03:36:50,640 --> 03:36:51,160
We should leave at once.

5262
03:36:51,680 --> 03:36:52,200
Okay.

5263
03:36:52,340 --> 03:36:53,440
Before we do this...

5264
03:36:53,440 --> 03:36:53,960
We should get moving.

5265
03:36:54,220 --> 03:36:57,360
I won't rest easy until Martin is safe at Cloud Ruler Temple.

5266
03:36:57,360 --> 03:36:57,740
Oh no!

5267
03:36:58,140 --> 03:36:58,940
It's empty!

5268
03:37:00,060 --> 03:37:01,400
Oh, are we leaving leaving?

5269
03:37:02,220 --> 03:37:02,740
Cuz...

5270
03:37:02,740 --> 03:37:05,020
He's got a Book of Daedra.

5271
03:37:06,580 --> 03:37:07,660
I'm not stealing.

5272
03:37:07,960 --> 03:37:08,580
I'm just licking.

5273
03:37:12,620 --> 03:37:13,140
Um...

5274
03:37:16,060 --> 03:37:19,000
Why is the bone glitching out?

5275
03:37:20,540 --> 03:37:22,780
I suggest horse riding to the temple.

5276
03:37:22,980 --> 03:37:23,540
It's scenic.

5277
03:37:24,560 --> 03:37:27,160
I think we're gonna do it next time.

5278
03:37:28,380 --> 03:37:30,520
But also, I wanna go back.

5279
03:37:30,680 --> 03:37:31,480
I wanna do...

5280
03:37:31,480 --> 03:37:34,100
Okay, if I just leave these guys here...

5281
03:37:34,100 --> 03:37:36,140
Can I go back to...

5282
03:37:39,320 --> 03:37:41,580
Can I go back to...

5283
03:37:43,600 --> 03:37:45,200
Skingrad and murder those men?

5284
03:37:50,770 --> 03:37:52,190
They will follow you.

5285
03:37:53,050 --> 03:37:55,130
If I tell them to wait here...

5286
03:37:55,130 --> 03:37:55,890
Maybe.

5287
03:37:56,190 --> 03:37:57,230
You gotta tell them to wait.

5288
03:37:57,470 --> 03:37:57,670
Okay.

5289
03:38:02,390 --> 03:38:04,010
Let's continue on to Cloud...

5290
03:38:04,010 --> 03:38:04,530
No, no, no.

5291
03:38:04,630 --> 03:38:05,030
Wait here.

5292
03:38:05,170 --> 03:38:07,290
I was looking forward to reaching Cloud Ruler Temple.

5293
03:38:07,570 --> 03:38:08,230
Don't be long.

5294
03:38:09,370 --> 03:38:11,130
You just heard about it right now.

5295
03:38:11,130 --> 03:38:12,850
My place is at Martin's side.

5296
03:38:13,050 --> 03:38:14,230
Okay, you stay here.

5297
03:38:15,250 --> 03:38:16,350
Oh, I think he's safe.

5298
03:38:16,730 --> 03:38:17,390
We should get moving.

5299
03:38:18,050 --> 03:38:20,850
I won't rest easy until Martin is safe with Cloud Ruler Temple.

5300
03:38:21,450 --> 03:38:22,490
Yeah, he's not...

5301
03:38:22,490 --> 03:38:23,070
He's not moving.

5302
03:38:33,730 --> 03:38:35,390
I don't know where the other guy went.

5303
03:38:36,150 --> 03:38:38,130
The other priest, but...

5304
03:38:38,130 --> 03:38:38,670
I think we're okay.

5305
03:38:43,530 --> 03:38:44,190
Okay.

5306
03:38:44,190 --> 03:38:44,250
Yeah.

5307
03:38:44,790 --> 03:38:46,650
The square goes into the square hole.

5308
03:38:47,190 --> 03:38:48,300
And the sheep...

5309
03:38:48,690 --> 03:38:50,310
Goes into the sheep hole.

5310
03:38:55,600 --> 03:38:56,260
Okay.

5311
03:39:04,860 --> 03:39:07,100
Actually, I think I'm gonna do it next time.

5312
03:39:07,600 --> 03:39:10,120
Okay, what I'll do is...

5313
03:39:10,120 --> 03:39:11,860
I'll get to the temple.

5314
03:39:12,340 --> 03:39:13,360
Wherever the heck that is.

5315
03:39:15,420 --> 03:39:16,520
There's a temple.

5316
03:39:17,120 --> 03:39:17,780
Somewhere.

5317
03:39:18,920 --> 03:39:19,900
We'll get there.

5318
03:39:20,940 --> 03:39:21,320
Somewhere.

5319
03:39:22,340 --> 03:39:22,980
Breville.

5320
03:39:23,940 --> 03:39:25,360
Come to Breville!

5321
03:39:26,720 --> 03:39:28,500
We should make that a sound alert.

5322
03:39:28,880 --> 03:39:30,600
Coop, coop, coop, coop.

5323
03:39:31,560 --> 03:39:33,160
Oh, north, north.

5324
03:39:33,660 --> 03:39:34,100
Oh!

5325
03:39:34,620 --> 03:39:35,940
I see it, I see it.

5326
03:39:37,840 --> 03:39:38,480
Skyrim?

5327
03:39:40,800 --> 03:39:41,860
No way.

5328
03:39:42,120 --> 03:39:42,980
Are they connected?

5329
03:39:42,980 --> 03:39:43,240
I did.

5330
03:39:44,760 --> 03:39:45,720
Please stop.

5331
03:39:51,680 --> 03:39:53,740
I think what we'll do is...

5332
03:39:53,740 --> 03:39:54,760
We'll take him there.

5333
03:39:54,940 --> 03:39:56,780
And then I can go and do the murder.

5334
03:39:57,440 --> 03:39:58,280
Next time.

5335
03:39:59,200 --> 03:40:02,260
Because I feel like I don't want to just stop in the middle of this quest.

5336
03:40:02,260 --> 03:40:03,900
Even though it's like the main quest.

5337
03:40:04,060 --> 03:40:04,100
Even though it's like the main quest.

5338
03:40:04,100 --> 03:40:05,400
And there's always gonna be something.

5339
03:40:05,540 --> 03:40:06,060
But I wanna...

5340
03:40:06,060 --> 03:40:07,260
I wanna be able to...

5341
03:40:08,660 --> 03:40:09,660
Oh, um...

5342
03:40:09,660 --> 03:40:10,060
So...

5343
03:40:10,060 --> 03:40:10,520
Sunday.

5344
03:40:10,880 --> 03:40:12,140
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

5345
03:40:13,420 --> 03:40:15,700
Is when we will pick up and we'll murder!

5346
03:40:16,040 --> 03:40:17,720
And we will...

5347
03:40:18,640 --> 03:40:19,140
Um...

5348
03:40:19,700 --> 03:40:20,540
Carry on.

5349
03:40:22,260 --> 03:40:22,660
Yeah.

5350
03:40:23,460 --> 03:40:24,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5351
03:40:24,440 --> 03:40:25,260
Sounds like a plan.

5352
03:40:26,980 --> 03:40:29,600
Basically, it gives you a pause once you drop Martin at the temple.

5353
03:40:29,720 --> 03:40:31,020
Yeah, I saw some people saying that.

5354
03:40:31,120 --> 03:40:32,320
So I think it'll be good to...

5355
03:40:32,320 --> 03:40:33,260
To do it.

5356
03:40:33,380 --> 03:40:34,540
And then we can, um...

5357
03:40:36,080 --> 03:40:36,880
Continue onwards.

5358
03:40:37,040 --> 03:40:38,280
Plus, I'm getting a little sleepy.

5359
03:40:38,500 --> 03:40:39,680
And I...

5360
03:40:39,680 --> 03:40:41,880
Don't know how long the murders will take.

5361
03:40:43,760 --> 03:40:44,560
Skyrim is...

5362
03:40:45,900 --> 03:40:46,700
Cyrodiil's Canada.

5363
03:40:46,700 --> 03:40:47,700
And, uh...

5364
03:40:48,540 --> 03:40:50,160
Hail to the hero of Kvatch!

5365
03:40:50,420 --> 03:40:51,560
You've done really good so far.

5366
03:40:51,660 --> 03:40:52,920
You've picked up this game so fast.

5367
03:40:53,040 --> 03:40:53,680
Thank you!

5368
03:40:54,480 --> 03:40:56,720
I'm having so much fun, so...

5369
03:40:56,720 --> 03:40:58,160
Sunday is psychopath day.

5370
03:40:58,820 --> 03:40:59,160
Yeah!

5371
03:41:02,500 --> 03:41:02,900
Yeah!

5372
03:41:06,240 --> 03:41:07,400
This game is hilarious.

5373
03:41:07,700 --> 03:41:08,360
I'm not gonna...

5374
03:41:08,360 --> 03:41:09,240
I'm not over...

5375
03:41:12,300 --> 03:41:16,320
I can't wait for someone to timestamp it so that I can click back to it.

5376
03:41:16,700 --> 03:41:18,380
Maybe I will make it a sound alert.

5377
03:41:19,040 --> 03:41:20,540
Gop, gop, gop, gop!

5378
03:41:25,680 --> 03:41:26,340
This is...

5379
03:41:26,340 --> 03:41:29,620
That's exactly the kind of content I wanted from this game.

5380
03:41:29,880 --> 03:41:31,820
So I'm having the most fun.

5381
03:41:33,440 --> 03:41:34,320
Wait until you...

5382
03:41:34,320 --> 03:41:34,620
Hi!

5383
03:41:34,780 --> 03:41:35,240
Oh my gosh!

5384
03:41:35,360 --> 03:41:36,480
I want to meet the...

5385
03:41:38,000 --> 03:41:38,880
So bad!

5386
03:41:39,380 --> 03:41:40,580
I want to meet them.

5387
03:41:43,760 --> 03:41:44,840
Thanks for the fun stream.

5388
03:41:45,100 --> 03:41:46,820
Gop, gop, gop, gop, gop!

5389
03:41:46,820 --> 03:41:50,600
What's up everybody!

5390
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:52,200
Thank you so, so much!

5391
03:41:53,360 --> 03:41:53,840
And...

5392
03:41:53,840 --> 03:41:54,600
Hopefully...

5393
03:41:54,600 --> 03:41:56,580
The game has looked okay while streaming.

5394
03:41:57,840 --> 03:41:59,120
With bit rate and...

5395
03:41:59,580 --> 03:42:00,760
If I have to...

5396
03:42:00,760 --> 03:42:04,240
If I have to turn down some of the plants and stuff, I can do that too.

5397
03:42:05,400 --> 03:42:05,880
But...

5398
03:42:06,980 --> 03:42:08,640
Just so it looks better on stream.

5399
03:42:10,600 --> 03:42:10,880
Oh!

5400
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:11,160
Oh!

5401
03:42:11,160 --> 03:42:12,340
Thank you for the fun.

5402
03:42:12,440 --> 03:42:13,140
Thank you!

5403
03:42:14,140 --> 03:42:15,100
That was totally fine?

5404
03:42:15,440 --> 03:42:15,760
Oh, okay.

5405
03:42:15,840 --> 03:42:16,340
Good, good, good.

5406
03:42:16,960 --> 03:42:17,760
Thank you guys!

5407
03:42:18,360 --> 03:42:18,880
Thank you guys!

5408
03:42:19,040 --> 03:42:19,520
Thank you, thank you!

5409
03:42:20,560 --> 03:42:21,520
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

5410
03:42:21,680 --> 03:42:23,480
I will see you guys when I see you next time!

5411
03:42:24,060 --> 03:42:24,160
Yeah!

5412
03:42:24,160 --> 03:42:25,160
Bye bye!

5413
03:42:26,420 --> 03:42:26,700
Bye bye!

5414
03:42:27,420 --> 03:42:27,820
Bye bye!

5415
03:42:27,820 --> 03:42:28,020
Bye bye!

5416
03:42:28,380 --> 03:42:28,960
Bye bye!

5417
03:42:29,100 --> 03:42:29,460
Bye bye!

5418
03:42:30,200 --> 03:42:30,900
Have a good day!

5419
03:42:31,020 --> 03:42:31,300
Have a good night!

5420
03:42:31,520 --> 03:42:32,680
Bye bye!

5421
03:42:32,880 --> 03:42:33,420
Bye bye!

5422
03:42:35,020 --> 03:42:35,460
Oh!

5423
03:42:47,290 --> 03:42:47,870
Oh wait!

5424
03:42:47,970 --> 03:42:48,510
You can hear me!

5425
03:42:48,730 --> 03:42:49,010
Ah!

5426
03:42:55,180 --> 03:42:56,420
You can hear me too!

5427
03:42:56,640 --> 03:42:56,860
Oops!

5428
03:42:57,120 --> 03:42:59,300
Sorry, if you can hear the BG, I'm also doubling.

5429
03:42:59,300 --> 03:42:59,380
Bye bye!

5430
03:42:59,380 --> 03:42:59,500
So long!

5431
03:42:59,720 --> 03:43:00,240
Hahaha!

5432
03:43:03,420 --> 03:43:04,160
Uh...
