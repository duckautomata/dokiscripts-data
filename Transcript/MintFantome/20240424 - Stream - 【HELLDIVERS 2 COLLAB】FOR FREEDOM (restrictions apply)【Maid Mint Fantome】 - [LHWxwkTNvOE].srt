1
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,900
Whoopsie, whoopsie-boopsie.

2
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,060
I said... I said...

3
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,300
Man...

4
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,280
I missed my joke.

5
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,960
Okay, hold on.

6
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,660
Redo, redo, redo, redo.

7
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,100
Okay.

8
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,540
That

9
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,060
was...

10
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,260
that was it.

11
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,500
But I don't think it worked so well the second time.

12
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,150
Goodwin?

13
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,830
You guys hate it!

14
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,670
You hate it!

15
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,770
You guys hate it!

16
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,690
I know!

17
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,130
I know!

18
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,890
You hate it!

19
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,450
You guys aren't booing at all!

20
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,070
You hate it.

21
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,670
I get it.

22
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,330
I get it.

23
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:29,730
I get it.

24
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,270
You hate it.

25
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:30,490
Okay?

26
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,610
You're not booing at all.

27
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,950
I get it.

28
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,710
This was a good joke.

29
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,860
Boo?

30
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,160
Boo for real?

31
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,480
Boo for real?

32
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,040
Yay!

33
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,080
I was saying boo.

34
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,940
Yay!

35
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,560
You guys like it!

36
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,060
And there it goes.

37
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,880
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

38
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,760
Hello everybody.

39
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,280
Welcome to Helldivers.

40
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,160
Today I will be playing with... with Matora, with Haruka, and...

41
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:03,980
And...

42
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:05,980
And...

43
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,480
And...

44
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,260
And...

45
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,960
And...

46
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,940
And...

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
And...

48
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
And...

49
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,940
And...

50
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,220
And...

51
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,260
And...

52
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,800
And...

53
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,460
And...

54
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,160
And...

55
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,940
And...

56
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:24,720
And...

57
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,580
And...

58
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
And...

59
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:26,820
And...

60
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,640
And...

61
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,600
And...

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:29,680
And...

63
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,120
And...

64
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,480
And...

65
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,660
I just like a normal amount.

66
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:36,860
Probably.

67
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,700
But it'll be fine.

68
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,280
It'll be okay.

69
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,880
If you're wondering where are those funny people at...

70
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,360
I'll tell you.

71
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
I'm playing the tutorial first.

72
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,060
And people wanted to see a video.

73
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,360
But it starts as soon as I open the game.

74
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,300
So I was like, close the game.

75
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
So now I'm going to start the game.

76
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,640
Play.

77
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,760
That's why we've been on a black screen this whole time.

78
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,640
I hope it'll capture.

79
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,200
It'll capture, right?

80
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,600
Oh yes.

81
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,140
Oh no!

82
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,840
Can't, can't, can't, can't capture!

83
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,300
It's there, it's there.

84
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,800
Okay.

85
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,340
Super Earth Ministry of Truth.

86
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,320
Semp.

87
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,020
Super Earth.

88
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,300
Whoa.

89
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,980
Super Earth.

90
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,600
Am I lagging?

91
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,460
A tiny bit.

92
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,040
Prosperity.

93
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,080
Liberty.

94
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,940
Liberty.

95
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,540
Hi there.

96
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,800
Oh my god, neighborhood.

97
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,820
Democracy.

98
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,820
Oh!

99
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,960
Democracy!

100
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,280
Our way of life.

101
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:01,820
Oh.

102
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,480
Hello.

103
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,360
Oh, we're a happy family.

104
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,980
Oh, oh, oh!

105
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,820
Sweet liberty!

106
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,020
No!

107
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,160
No, not the liberty!

108
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,200
Invasion.

109
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,600
Look familiar?

110
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,840
Oh my god, he's in grief.

111
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,060
Scenes like these are happening all over the galaxy right now.

112
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,060
He's in so much grief, he's hallucinating his family.

113
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,100
You could be next.

114
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:26,840
Me?

115
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,400
That is, unless you make the most important decision of your life.

116
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:31,720
What's that?

117
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,960
Shaved my head?

118
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,060
Prove to yourself that you have the strength and the courage to be free.

119
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,340
Oh, I'm free!

120
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,840
I'm free!

121
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,400
Join the Helldivers!

122
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,820
Become part of an elite peace-keeping force!

123
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,400
These suits are so sexy!

124
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,360
Yeah!

125
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,560
See exotic new life forms?

126
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,440
Oh my god, I love him!

127
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,100
And spread managed democracy throughout the galaxy.

128
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,980
Become a hero.

129
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,860
Become a legend.

130
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,340
What?

131
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,040
What?

132
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,640
Wow, that should be me in that plane.

133
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,080
Become a Helldiver.

134
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,960
A Helldiver.

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,860
Mm-hmm!

136
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,740
That's us today, that's us four.

137
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,140
Sorry that I'm lagging a little bit.

138
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm going to fix some settings once it lets me.

139
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,880
Top secret!

140
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,460
Age?

141
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,440
Oh my gosh!

142
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,660
That's...

143
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,160
Wait, oh, average age, maybe?

144
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,780
The game is too high quality.

145
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,020
The game is too high quality.

146
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,960
I can't believe we're actually going to become Helldivers.

147
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,860
Oh my god, me and you, girlfriend.

148
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,360
Project Hellsink.

149
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080
Liberating the galaxy.

150
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,920
Stomping bugs.

151
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,920
They're bugs.

152
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,760
Every kid's dream.

153
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,620
I'm...

154
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,740
What kind of psychopath kid are you?

155
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
Good luck out there.

156
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,700
Thank you.

157
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,600
I'll see you on the front lines.

158
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,120
Okay!

159
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,680
Earn your cake.

160
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,300
You're on your own from here, recruit.

161
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:07,940
Whoa!

162
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,340
Bye, Pequod!

163
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,240
Okay, hold on.

164
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,800
Let's see.

165
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,760
Oh, that's me!

166
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,220
Okay, hold on.

167
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,740
Let's see.

168
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,040
Display.

169
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:24,980
Let's see.

170
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,040
Not ultra quality.

171
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,560
Maybe just regular quality.

172
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,760
Let's see.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,980
Frame rate limit.

174
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,020
Let's just...

175
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,000
Why won't it let me...

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,060
Oh, frame rate limit on.

177
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay.

178
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,960
Let's do like 60.

179
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,280
I don't think...

180
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,860
I don't think anymore will do anything on...

181
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,500
On YouTube anyway.

182
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Is the Vsync on?

183
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,140
Well, no.

184
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,380
Wait.

185
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,720
I can never remember.

186
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,300
Is it on?

187
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,720
Wait.

188
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,320
Oh, gosh.

189
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
I'm lagging still.

190
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,200
269.

191
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,760
Stop, you guys!

192
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,160
Stop!

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,560
Hmm.

194
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,200
Okay.

195
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,840
Okay.

196
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:07,860
Okay.

197
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,940
Vsync usually off.

198
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,800
Wait.

199
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,280
Off if you are lagging.

200
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,540
Okay.

201
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,600
Let's apply this.

202
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,880
Oh!

203
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,780
Would you look at that?

204
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,400
Already fixed.

205
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,860
Is there a motion blur or anything like that?

206
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,540
Oh, motion blur?

207
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,320
Oh.

208
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,400
Maybe we can take...

209
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,660
Turn it like a little bit on.

210
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,380
Like 50%.

211
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:35,960
Yeah.

212
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,860
Zero?

213
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:37,940
Okay.

214
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,080
Zero?

215
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,060
Zero motion blur?

216
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,160
You sure?

217
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,640
You sure?

218
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:44,820
Okay.

219
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,640
I'll turn it off.

220
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,680
I'll turn it off.

221
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,320
I'll turn it off.

222
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:49,820
Okay.

223
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,160
Let's see how this works now.

224
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,340
Quickly as possible.

225
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,860
Thank you.

226
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,180
Have a good day.

227
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,500
Good.

228
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,200
Thank you.

229
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,380
Oh, where do I go?

230
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,920
Tab to view the map.

231
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,020
I need to go that way?

232
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,940
Hold on.

233
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,980
Hold right-click while map is open.

234
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,300
Oh.

235
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,960
Oh, neat.

236
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,060
I got to get my cake.

237
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay.

238
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,300
Welcome to hell diver training.

239
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,780
Your instructor is waiting for you up ahead.

240
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,640
Please proceed.

241
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,760
Uh, how do I do anything?

242
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,580
Hmmm.

243
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,180
See you on the other side.

244
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,820
See ya.

245
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,740
Huh!

246
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:35,900
Hup!

247
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,220
I'm General Brash!

248
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,840
Super Earth's oldest and most grizzled war hero.

249
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,480
And I'm not easy to impress.

250
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,720
Helldiver training is the toughest test in the galaxy.

251
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,020
But I can tell that doesn't scare you.

252
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,740
Impressive.

253
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,180
Now, enough jib jab.

254
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,360
The upcoming obstacles will take everything your exceptional physique can muster.

255
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,180
This is it.

256
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,580
The real deal.

257
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,320
Get to it, soldier.

258
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,000
Whoa!

259
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,360
Okay.

260
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,620
Let's see the crouch.

261
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,140
Easy.

262
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,400
Space.

263
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,780
Space.

264
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,000
Or sprint.

265
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,640
Okay, nice.

266
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,680
Okay, I'm earning this cape with flying colors.

267
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,380
Traverse obstacles.

268
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,800
Easy.

269
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,620
In all my years I've never...

270
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:30,840
Dent?

271
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,140
Danger?

272
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,100
Dive?

273
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,340
Okay.

274
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,120
Dive.

275
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,560
Alt?

276
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,180
Wait.

277
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,720
Alt.

278
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,680
Oh.

279
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,120
Oh.

280
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,100
What did I just press?

281
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,720
Dive!

282
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,480
Hello?

283
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:50,860
Oh!

284
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,340
I was pressing X on accident.

285
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,840
Hahaha.

286
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,020
Okay.

287
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,040
Do I have to...

288
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,200
This is fine, everybody.

289
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,760
I dove...

290
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,280
Okay.

291
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,540
Hold on.

292
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,700
Okay.

293
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,300
Dive here.

294
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,230
The aliens have guns?

295
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,330
Oh.

296
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,130
Oh.

297
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,490
Battlefield Injury Simulator.

298
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,150
Battlefield Injury Simulator?

299
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,070
Beep boop.

300
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,990
Oh!

301
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,570
That's not a simulator.

302
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,330
I think... I think I'm actually dying.

303
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:50,970
Nice.

304
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:51,530
Oh.

305
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,370
Use this thing.

306
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:54,950
That's me!

307
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,670
I said that!

308
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,110
Freedom never sleeps!

309
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,430
You're about to encounter democracy's sworn enemy, recruit!

310
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,290
Alright.

311
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,510
Where am I at?

312
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:06,730
What?

313
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,950
Oh.

314
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,490
Um...

315
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,510
There it is.

316
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,270
The terminate.

317
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,050
The scourge of liberty.

318
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,790
Ewww.

319
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,070
Arm yourself and show that bug the true meaning of freedom.

320
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:19,990
Yeah!

321
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,990
Now, use the grenade to close up that bug hole.

322
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:25,550
Oh.

323
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:25,830
Okay.

324
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,750
Otherwise, they'll just keep coming.

325
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,450
Grenade!

326
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:29,970
Uh.

327
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,270
G to quick throw a grenade.

328
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,350
Uh.

329
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,050
How do I throw?

330
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,490
Oh.

331
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,490
What a catapult of an arm!

332
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,710
On to the next section.

333
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,270
Okay.

334
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,670
Um.

335
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,410
No diving.

336
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,790
No diving.

337
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,490
Look up in the sky, recruit.

338
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,750
Up there is a super destroyer.

339
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,730
And it's all powerful stratagems of yours to command.

340
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:53,570
Control?

341
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,370
Use the stratagem now to take care of those bugs.

342
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,110
Is it nearly combat?

343
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,990
Just make sure you take a few steps back.

344
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,030
Um.

345
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,050
To dial.

346
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,470
Oh.

347
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,370
Beep boop.

348
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,370
Oh.

349
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,250
I see it up there.

350
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,890
I see it up there.

351
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,270
And...

352
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,170
Fire.

353
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,350
Wait.

354
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:12,730
I think...

355
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,950
Did I throw it too far?

356
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,290
Uh.

357
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:19,370
Okay.

358
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:19,650
Hold on.

359
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,330
Oh.

360
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,930
Don't come here.

361
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,370
Don't come here.

362
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,270
Oh.

363
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:28,700
Easy.

364
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:29,900
Oh.

365
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,560
I

366
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:41,930
don't have enough.

367
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,350
Okay.

368
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:43,550
Beep beep boop.

369
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,570
One more.

370
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,150
To here.

371
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,830
Look it.

372
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,250
They're hungry.

373
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,850
Who am I to...

374
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,510
Who am I to blow these guys up?

375
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,530
They're just trying to live.

376
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:55,950
Right?

377
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,350
The will of democracy.

378
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,470
Oh.

379
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,150
For democracy.

380
00:15:59,330 --> 00:15:59,750
That's why.

381
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,530
Next lesson.

382
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,050
Helldivers fight in squads.

383
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,770
Meet your new squad member.

384
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,050
I love cardboard man.

385
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,730
What a fine soldier.

386
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,670
Your brother in arms.

387
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,430
My brother.

388
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,370
A battle forged bond that could never be replaced.

389
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,630
Until now.

390
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,990
Here's your real lesson soldier.

391
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,590
Squad mates can and will perish tragically all the time.

392
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,370
Now.

393
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,250
No cardboard.

394
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,230
Use the reinforcement stratagem to have another helldiver take their place.

395
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,470
Oh.

396
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,150
What the?

397
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,230
Putting in the Konami code up in here.

398
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:32,490
Oh.

399
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,430
A ball.

400
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,730
Here.

401
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,290
Oh.

402
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,990
What?

403
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,890
Oh my god.

404
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,410
It's like he never left.

405
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,730
How do I know which one I'm selecting though?

406
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,730
This is the real deal.

407
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,290
It's just you.

408
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,750
The gun in your hands.

409
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,230
And two thousand megatons of explosives in close orbit.

410
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,050
That's it.

411
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:02,790
Wait.

412
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,010
Okay.

413
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,370
So.

414
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,070
How do I know which one I'm selecting?

415
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,630
Okay.

416
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,210
Wait.

417
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,670
Hard reload.

418
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,890
What's three?

419
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,510
Piece of advice.

420
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,350
Moving around makes it hard to aim.

421
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,190
For A-list accuracy.

422
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,610
I'm scared.

423
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,330
Stay still while you shoot.

424
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,150
Oh.

425
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,090
Stay still?

426
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,310
Do you want me to die?

427
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,370
Oh my god.

428
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,250
Oh my god.

429
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,270
I'm gonna die.

430
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,050
I'm gonna die.

431
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,350
Oh.

432
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,670
Wait.

433
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,710
How do I switch to the grenade?

434
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:38,890
Oh.

435
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,630
That's not a grenade.

436
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,390
Oh.

437
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,430
Oh.

438
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,850
Oh.

439
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,830
There they go.

440
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,150
Oh, man.

441
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,710
Three?

442
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,470
Where's the...

443
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,340
Oh gee.

444
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,580
Uh oh.

445
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,340
Reload.

446
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,240
Oh g...

447
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,040
Oh, Omg.

448
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,580
I'm gonna...

449
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,280
Don't, don't...

450
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,060
Velazquez.

451
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,500
Jay.

452
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,800
A genius.

453
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,840
Can I keep going?

454
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,620
Let's go.

455
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,960
Watch out for falling...

456
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,540
Hellpots.

457
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,700
What's the big gun?

458
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,040
Active hitting.

459
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,100
You are literally title card.

460
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,060
Literally invincible.

461
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,840
Oh, uh... throw down...

462
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,620
Hello?

463
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,500
Hello?

464
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,880
Where's my gun?

465
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,080
I did it wrong!

466
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,020
Oh, okay.

467
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,800
Well, it looked like it was kind of busy up in here, you know?

468
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,640
Okay, there.

469
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,500
Get me...

470
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,560
Wow...

471
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,780
Oh my god.

472
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,360
That's the stuff?

473
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,160
Now, use a resupply strategy to get yourself some more ammo.

474
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:23,840
Okay.

475
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,200
Uh, how do I know what I'm...

476
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,420
Oh, I see, I see.

477
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,700
So you put in the code for whichever one that you want.

478
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,680
So if I want to summon a person, I put in that up, up, down, down.

479
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:38,860
Hello?

480
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,480
Um, I'm gonna die here if you don't hurry.

481
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,080
The DDR codes?

482
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,800
Yeah.

483
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,180
Load up, soldier.

484
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
Because playtime's over.

485
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,700
You've reached your final test.

486
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,140
Oh no.

487
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,740
This is the real deal.

488
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,380
Get to it!

489
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,340
Okay.

490
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,340
I'm scared.

491
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,440
This area is in dire need of liberation from the Terminid Scourge.

492
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,040
Activate that terminal!

493
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,300
I'm activating.

494
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
I'm activated.

495
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,520
Oh.

496
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,680
DDR!

497
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,960
I'm going!

498
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,290
Liberation.

499
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,100
I've never seen that.

500
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,180
I've never seen such flawless terminal activation.

501
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,720
Thank you, sir.

502
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,000
Now, somewhere around here is the flag of Super Earth.

503
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,720
Super Earth.

504
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,680
Find it and plant it where all can see its democratic glory.

505
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,220
This?

506
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,700
That's the flag of Super Earth, recruit.

507
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,140
Yep.

508
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,180
Plant it in the designated area.

509
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,460
Here?

510
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,520
We own this place now.

511
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,000
Make sure you show it the proper respect.

512
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,100
Salute the...

513
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,600
Yeah!

514
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,800
Oh my

515
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,220
god.

516
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,180
Where are the babies?

517
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,760
Oh!

518
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,140
Oh!

519
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,620
Oh!

520
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,360
Oh!

521
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,460
Why are you still alive?

522
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,010
More prosperity!

523
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,030
Oh.

524
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,110
We did it.

525
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,580
Already, you've advanced the cause of debauchery I've ever seen.

526
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,140
Oh my god.

527
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,900
You've proved your worth.

528
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,900
You're ready to don your cape.

529
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,660
That's me.

530
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,140
That's me.

531
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,920
Oh.

532
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,460
Contract.

533
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,000
Wait.

534
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,840
I thought this was a wall of like...

535
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:30,900
Oh.

536
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,880
Superhero.

537
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,440
Best people.

538
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,420
Wait.

539
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,780
Wait.

540
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,400
There's a contract?

541
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,560
Wait.

542
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:36,820
Wait.

543
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,060
Wait.

544
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,800
Termination?

545
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,300
Hold on.

546
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:49,200
This agreement will be governed by the laws of Super Earth and shall be terminated in the event that the enlisted is mortally wounded such that medical attention shall not be physically or finan...

547
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,480
Finan...

548
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,260
Financially...

549
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,040
What do you mean?

550
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,420
My...

551
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
My health is not financially justifiable.

552
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,100
Justifiable.

553
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,700
Don't read this?

554
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,700
Don't read it?

555
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,300
Don't read it?

556
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,080
They care about me.

557
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,380
They gave me a cape you guys.

558
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,400
There's more?

559
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,200
Wait.

560
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,040
Wait.

561
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,360
There's...

562
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,420
There's actually more.

563
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,660
Oh.

564
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:11,780
Wait.

565
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:11,980
Wait.

566
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,140
Wait.

567
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,360
Okay.

568
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,080
It's kind of the same.

569
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:15,980
Okay.

570
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,080
I'm gonna do like a slow walk.

571
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,760
Okay.

572
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
This is the slowest I can go I think.

573
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,580
Get me my cape.

574
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,720
Reading the contract is a vile...

575
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,140
Oh.

576
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,380
Oh.

577
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,680
Oh.

578
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,200
You are a hell diver.

579
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,020
You remind me of a younger me.

580
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
I wish I could jump.

581
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,280
... and vulnerable and seven feet tall.

582
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,060
You're finally ready for the realest deal of them all.

583
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,940
The Galactic War.

584
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,460
I'm ready.

585
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:44,860
I'm ready.

586
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,320
Democracy.

587
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,720
Justice.

588
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,680
They're in your hands now.

589
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,180
General Brush over and out.

590
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,380
Over and out.

591
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,140
She crouching.

592
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,620
Is it a requirement?

593
00:22:59,620 --> 00:22:59,680
Oh.

594
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,780
Is the environment to be seven feet tall, or...

595
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,240
How long do you think all these guys had to wait in these pods for?

596
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,740
They were like, God, I hope this guy finishes soon.

597
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,420
Mint Fright Dom Level 1 Cadet!

598
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,040
They're frozen, don't worry.

599
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,880
Just like my desert dinner.

600
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,040
Yippee!

601
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,400
Mars!

602
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,180
Of Destruction!

603
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,300
It's the best anime ever.

604
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,740
Name your super destroyer ship.

605
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,980
Let's see.

606
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,880
Oh no, you guys, what should we name it?

607
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,680
What should we name it?

608
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,000
Dream of Battle.

609
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,180
Let's see what else we got on here.

610
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,140
Democracy.

611
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,300
It's a big one.

612
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,000
It's a cool one.

613
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,560
I bet they're waiting on me, so I don't want to take so long.

614
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,840
Independence.

615
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,860
Iron!

616
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,880
Law, Liberty.

617
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,020
Patriotism!

618
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,120
Pride.

619
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,380
Science.

620
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,940
Oh my gosh, this is too much pressure.

621
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,060
This is too much pressure.

622
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,900
Judge of Judgment.

623
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,480
Fist of War.

624
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:40,960
Here.

625
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,120
Maybe I just...

626
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,660
Founding Father of War.

627
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,420
Wait, was there Patriot?

628
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,520
Patriot.

629
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:55,860
Panther.

630
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,280
Ombudsman?

631
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,540
Patriot?

632
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,480
Where is...

633
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:00,860
These are sons?

634
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,320
Patriot...

635
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,840
Someone said family, right?

636
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,220
Patriot of family values.

637
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,240
Patriot of...

638
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,700
Patriot of Patriotism.

639
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,140
That's even better.

640
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,880
I'm the Patriot of Patriotism.

641
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,920
The most patriotic you could ever get.

642
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,440
Patriot.

643
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,440
Patriot.

644
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,420
Of Patriotism.

645
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,780
It's written right there.

646
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,420
Oh my gosh, that was awesome.

647
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:36,720
Okay.

648
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,560
Oh!

649
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,140
There's even more, wow.

650
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,540
Congratulations on completing training, Helldiver.

651
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:41,980
Thank you.

652
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,460
You're in charge of this vessel now.

653
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:43,880
Me?

654
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,820
The democracy officer awaits you on the bridge.

655
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,580
Welcome to the Galactic War.

656
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,400
Thanks.

657
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,240
All right.

658
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:52,960
Wow!

659
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,940
Oh my gosh, these uniforms are so sexy though, right?

660
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,100
Look how cool we look.

661
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:00,960
Wow!

662
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,280
Nice.

663
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,580
Okay, guys.

664
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,240
I'm glad that we could warm up with you.

665
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,960
Or I could warm up with you guys because I...

666
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,180
I'm so nervous.

667
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:12,800
Oh!

668
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,920
I am so nervous to collab with Enya.

669
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,300
But we're gonna have fun, okay?

670
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,820
The lalilulelo of lalilulelo-ism.

671
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:22,940
I'm so nervous.

672
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,440
You get to meet Irohoshi today.

673
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,080
I know.

674
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,680
It's, you know, because I collabed with Haruka before.

675
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,080
A couple years ago actually.

676
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,560
I mean, well, I haven't streamed for a couple years, but we played Among Us together.

677
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,160
I believe it was Among Us.

678
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,000
And of course, Matara.

679
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,540
Mom's spaghetti!

680
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,780
That's me!

681
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,220
Oh god, my tummy hurts.

682
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,140
Okay, let me let them know that I'm ready.

683
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm... I'm ready now!

684
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,100
We're all waiting.

685
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,380
Hello?

686
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,560
Hi!

687
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,120
You're huge!

688
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,920
I thought you were a bug!

689
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,760
I gotta shoot you!

690
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,840
Wait, hello?

691
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,420
Hello?

692
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
I can hear you back on your...

693
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,700
I think all my... hold on, all my settings are messed up because I moved my computer yesterday.

694
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,480
Give me one second.

695
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,280
You're messed up.

696
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,020
Hello!

697
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,520
Hania, she's fixing her...

698
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,030
Hi!

699
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,020
It's a nice weather, isn't it today?

700
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,900
It's good weather!

701
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,120
Hello?

702
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,980
Sorry, I disconnected.

703
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,000
It was really weird.

704
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,460
Are you okay?

705
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,740
Is everything okay with you?

706
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,640
Wait, why are you throwing up after you're talking to me?

707
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,880
You said you enjoyed the comics!

708
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,530
I enjoyed it too much!

709
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,230
Why are you throwing up?

710
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,610
Why are you throwing up, Dayo?

711
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,960
Hi, Haru.

712
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,120
Oh, did I join it?

713
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,580
Hi!

714
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,760
They're already arguing.

715
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,060
It's been forever!

716
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,380
It's been forever!

717
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,000
Yay!

718
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,800
Yay!

719
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
It's been forever!

720
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,900
The only time we collabed is when you graduated, now you're back!

721
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,480
I was just saying that!

722
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,660
I was like, it's been a long time since I...

723
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,680
It's been three years!

724
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,460
I know!

725
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Three years!

726
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,220
We were mutuals and everything.

727
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,580
We were too shy to talk to each other and now we're here.

728
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,540
Now we're here.

729
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,280
Yay!

730
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,340
Sorry, Mr. TooBuzz.

731
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,640
I tried many things.

732
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,540
I'll boot up the game.

733
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,440
I'm so happy to collab with you guys!

734
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,800
Thanks for having me!

735
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:56,980
Yeah!

736
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,100
I was so excited!

737
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:58,920
Yeah!

738
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,180
I'm eating an egg sandwich, so I hope you don't mind my food.

739
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,820
I had an egg sandwich!

740
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,900
Oh my god, they're the same person.

741
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,980
Is it from Tim Hortons?

742
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
No, I got it from a store.

743
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,300
They have an egg sandwich.

744
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,240
A store?

745
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,780
Yeah, they have an everything sandwich.

746
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,460
Hold on, let me turn you guys... you're all not very loud.

747
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,580
I think you're very loud for me.

748
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,280
I'm always very loud.

749
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,780
I had a collab and every streamer was like yelling in it.

750
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,120
And now I have all the quiet girls.

751
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,440
It's ironic considering I shot all the time, but you always seem to catch me when I just woke up.

752
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,240
Every time I collab with Haru, she just wakes up.

753
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:37,460
Good morning!

754
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:37,640
Ohayo!

755
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,640
Ohayo!

756
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,220
Ohayo!

757
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,000
Alright, I'm gonna open the game.

758
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,100
Min, do I have you at it?

759
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,440
Because you can jump off of me to get into the game.

760
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,520
Oh yes, I have you.

761
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,360
How do I jump off of you?

762
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,240
You're gonna open my name and then you're just gonna do a join game from there.

763
00:30:59,380 --> 00:30:59,640
Okay.

764
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,040
It's pretty easy.

765
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,000
You can figure it out, my love.

766
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,420
Hi!

767
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,200
I believe in you.

768
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:05,980
Yeah!

769
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,840
I'm so excited!

770
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,040
Thank you for joining me.

771
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,240
Basically, we got... Henya and I are fairly new to the game.

772
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,280
Mint, this is gonna be your first time.

773
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,920
My first time.

774
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,240
But Haruka is a pro.

775
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,140
Yeah, she's a pro at gaming.

776
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,860
She is like... she'll be doing all the stuff.

777
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,700
She'll be explaining how to do stuff while the three of us will probably just run around yelling.

778
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,740
Yeah, Haruka carry dayo!

779
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,600
Haruka carry dayo!

780
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,260
Haruka carry dayo!

781
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,400
Yay!

782
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,060
It's true.

783
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,460
Oh my god.

784
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,980
It's true.

785
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,220
It's true.

786
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:39,740
Oh my god, this dayo.

787
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,600
I'm looking... I see you.

788
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,780
Yeah.

789
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,020
Wait.

790
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,060
Play... wait.

791
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,980
I click... wait.

792
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,680
Join.

793
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,380
Hold on.

794
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,620
I have to get in the game first.

795
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:53,940
Okay.

796
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,160
And then you can get in.

797
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,180
Okay.

798
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,460
Have some patience, Mint.

799
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,840
I don't even see where I say to join.

800
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,680
You'll see it once I'm in the game and like... yeah.

801
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,160
Okay.

802
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:07,700
I'll try it now.

803
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,060
Ba ba ba.

804
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,640
Oh, join get... you're so smart.

805
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,840
Oh, it's so beautiful.

806
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,740
It's so humble.

807
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,580
Yippee.

808
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,960
Is there an in-game chat or...

809
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,420
Yeah, you can type.

810
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,820
But we're going to be in Discord and talking to one another.

811
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,200
Okay.

812
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,160
How... what would you say is your experience, Mint Fulton, with shooting games?

813
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,860
I'm really good.

814
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,840
Uh-huh.

815
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:37,980
Oh.

816
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,120
Oh, Minto.

817
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:39,980
Yeah?

818
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,000
You want to... hold on.

819
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,020
I have food in my mouth.

820
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,620
If you want to turn off your microphone...

821
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,160
Oh.

822
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,420
Press escape.

823
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,060
Uh-huh.

824
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,580
Go to options.

825
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,180
Uh-huh.

826
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,660
Go to audio.

827
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,320
Uh-huh.

828
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:53,860
Uh-huh.

829
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,700
And there's voice chat.

830
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,440
Oh.

831
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,020
Because I think you have broadcast microphone so I could hear myself and you and everyone at the same time.

832
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,040
Oh.

833
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

834
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,040
No, no, no.

835
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,660
Yeah, she had it.

836
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,340
Is that better?

837
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,020
It's okay, guys.

838
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,540
Oh, yeah, yeah.

839
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,100
Okay.

840
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,340
She's new to streaming.

841
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,120
She hasn't...

842
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,960
I'm new to streaming.

843
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,300
Yeah.

844
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,580
She's new to streaming.

845
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,660
She's got to learn.

846
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,240
She's rusty, I should say.

847
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,100
I'm rusty.

848
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,640
She hasn't streamed in three years.

849
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,580
Yeah.

850
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,360
Exactly.

851
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,160
Be nice to me.

852
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,400
Exactly.

853
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:19,840
Exactly.

854
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,160
You know what?

855
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,340
Fuck you.

856
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,000
I love you.

857
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,600
There you go.

858
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,460
Oh, boy.

859
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:26,840
All right.

860
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,100
Now this is how you know we're friends.

861
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,220
Yeah.

862
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,620
Exactly.

863
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,120
Yay.

864
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,400
Friend.

865
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,180
We've been...

866
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,080
Technically, we've been friends for almost four years, if you really think about it.

867
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,680
Yeah.

868
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,080
That's kind of crazy.

869
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,420
Isn't that crazy?

870
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,680
That is kind of crazy.

871
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:41,840
Yeah.

872
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,180
Will you defend it?

873
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,400
Wow.

874
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,640
I still remember when you first debuted, you were this cute little ghosty ghost.

875
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,160
Stop.

876
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,920
Stop talking about me like that, Mom.

877
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,120
You're embarrassing me.

878
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,980
And now she's old.

879
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,240
I know you're old.

880
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,140
I still remember when you debuted as this model, too.

881
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,080
And I...

882
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,100
Oh, my God.

883
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,840
I was so emotional.

884
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,800
I was like, oh, my God.

885
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,220
There's my baby little mint.

886
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,060
Aw.

887
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,680
Aw.

888
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,040
Ew.

889
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:05,720
Ew.

890
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,120
Ew.

891
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,160
Ew.

892
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,540
Ew.

893
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:07,900
Ew.

894
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:08,900
Ew.

895
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:08,920
Ew.

896
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,360
Ew.

897
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:11,660
Ew.

898
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:11,840
Ew.

899
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:12,560
Ew.

900
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,360
Ew.

901
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,280
We'll ramp it up if Mint is comfy.

902
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,120
Okay.

903
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,140
But basically, Mint, you have to fight either the bugs, my cousins, or you gotta fight the robots.

904
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:22,740
Okay.

905
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,160
I say, at the start, the bugs are much easier, because the robots jump back at you.

906
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,200
Oh, yeah.

907
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,660
That's bad.

908
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,680
If you have any questions, please ask ahead.

909
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,000
Right?

910
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,980
This is one of those...

911
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,900
Do you get the weapons...

912
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,580
Are they...

913
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,020
Are the weapons OSP?

914
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,060
What's an OSP?

915
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,180
Are they...

916
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,280
Do you get them...

917
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,720
Do you bring them with you?

918
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,900
Or do you get them, like, there?

919
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,100
You bring them with you, but you have to summon them.

920
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,700
It's called strategy.

921
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,160
Ask us anything.

922
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:53,880
Honestly.

923
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,820
Ask us anything.

924
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,280
Feel free.

925
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:55,900
Okay.

926
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,960
We'll yap at you.

927
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,520
We'll teach you.

928
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,360
I'm gonna run around.

929
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,880
I'm gonna look at my cape.

930
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,840
It's really flowy.

931
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,720
I recommend sticking with the buddy.

932
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,120
I recommend you stick with Henya.

933
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,100
And I'll be with you guys often.

934
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,820
Is this Henya?

935
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,220
Henya?

936
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,360
Henya?

937
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:13,700
Henya?

938
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,340
No, that's not Henya.

939
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,500
That's our commander.

940
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,240
Oh, God.

941
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,640
Yeah, that's me, Henya Dayo.

942
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,880
She's talking to the wrong person.

943
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,560
I love it.

944
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,380
He's a big, muscular man.

945
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,500
Henya, you're so...

946
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,940
Your muscles are so big.

947
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,000
Your brain is so large.

948
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,340
Oh, yeah.

949
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,680
I have been working on Dayo.

950
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,300
Thank you.

951
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,740
Where do I go?

952
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,000
Do I go into a little...

953
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,580
Go to the help pod.

954
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,120
At the end of the ship, there's, like, a little pod and you go into it.

955
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,460
Oh, here.

956
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,900
My very own help pod.

957
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,840
Yeah.

958
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,420
So, basically, like, you choose...

959
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:43,700
What am I doing?

960
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,640
The person who started.

961
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,260
What am I here?

962
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,040
What am I here?

963
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,300
And then you here pick, like, your stuff.

964
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,180
As you gain more levels, you'll be able to have more stratagems and, you know, you have more of them.

965
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:53,920
Okay.

966
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,240
Do I just click anything?

967
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,840
For now, you'll have very few.

968
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,200
Oh.

969
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:57,780
Oh.

970
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,600
Oh.

971
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,080
Oh.

972
00:35:59,380 --> 00:35:59,880
What's this?

973
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,340
Oh.

974
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:00,840
Oh.

975
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,760
Yeah.

976
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,760
Just add anything and then play around with it.

977
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,440
See how you like it.

978
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,020
Okay.

979
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,080
Help pod.

980
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,800
Holy fuck.

981
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,600
Ooh.

982
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,920
Let's go this one.

983
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,880
Oh, I can't even...

984
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,340
Wow.

985
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,800
You guys look so cool.

986
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,220
Thank you.

987
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,820
I got it from eBay.

988
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,900
Oh, wow.

989
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:18,980
Ooh.

990
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,180
Ooh.

991
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,620
eBay.

992
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,060
I bought $500 on eBay.

993
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:21,920
What?

994
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,440
There's even eBay on Super Earth?

995
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,800
Yeah.

996
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,020
Always.

997
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,120
Always.

998
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,860
And then my mom confiscated my credit card.

999
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,480
Oh.

1000
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,880
So I can't buy any more.

1001
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,340
All right.

1002
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,960
It's because you bought those Roblox.

1003
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,060
I did.

1004
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,980
Oh, the Roblox.

1005
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,180
I don't know what it is, but I did buy it.

1006
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,660
The Fortnite money.

1007
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,700
The Fortnite money.

1008
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:41,840
Oh, this one.

1009
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,000
Oh, wait.

1010
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,880
Extra pod.

1011
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,140
Wait, can I equip it?

1012
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,240
Why won't it let me equip?

1013
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,580
Yeah.

1014
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,080
Usually you can...

1015
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I think if you press R, you'll be able to equip in the equipments.

1016
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,460
Yeah.

1017
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:51,780
This one.

1018
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,320
Oh, wait.

1019
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,900
How do I get it?

1020
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,320
Oh, ready?

1021
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:53,520
Yeah.

1022
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:53,720
Sorry.

1023
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,260
I'm ready.

1024
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:54,740
I think.

1025
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,180
Oh, don't worry.

1026
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:55,960
You'll see.

1027
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,160
As you get into the game, it's a lot at first to kind of...

1028
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,160
But now the best part is coming, Min.

1029
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,620
Are you ready?

1030
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,360
Oh, yeah.

1031
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,160
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

1032
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,960
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

1033
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:10,780
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

1034
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,620
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

1035
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:11,640
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

1036
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,560
You know what's really funny?

1037
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,420
What?

1038
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,320
I have the comfiest music playing right now.

1039
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,820
You have what?

1040
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,720
You're doing what?

1041
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,080
Yeah.

1042
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,520
I have the comfiest music playing in my ears right now.

1043
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,880
Are you listening to Shalalala?

1044
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,220
Shalalala.

1045
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:24,560
Oh, shit.

1046
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,160
Shalalala.

1047
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,320
Oh, my God.

1048
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,880
I should be singing Shalala.

1049
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:28,940
Yay.

1050
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,520
But the...

1051
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,600
If anybody saw the Bishojo concert, it's the Hanya and Haruka duo song.

1052
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:37,780
Shalalala.

1053
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,160
Na, na, na, na.

1054
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,840
Na, na, na, na.

1055
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,660
Na, na, na, na.

1056
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,680
Na, na, na, na.

1057
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,120
Oh, and there's a fire, by the way.

1058
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,120
Oh, thank you.

1059
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,440
Thank you.

1060
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:44,660
Oh.

1061
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,060
Oh.

1062
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,320
You have to...

1063
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,660
Nice.

1064
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,420
I'm alive.

1065
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,620
There's a little jellyfish.

1066
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,620
Do you know how to summon your items?

1067
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,460
Control, right?

1068
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,500
Yeah.

1069
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:55,860
And then...

1070
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,660
Which...

1071
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:56,980
What is it?

1072
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,400
You play DDR.

1073
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,740
Is it resupply?

1074
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,200
No.

1075
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,540
No.

1076
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:00,640
Just kidding.

1077
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,320
It's your weapon.

1078
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,920
You have like a little gun that you can order.

1079
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1080
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,140
I just clicked the resupply.

1081
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,160
Yep, yep.

1082
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,340
Oh.

1083
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,040
Wait.

1084
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,700
Nice resupply.

1085
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,240
Yep.

1086
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,880
Nice resupply.

1087
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,500
You have a machine gun, right?

1088
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,200
Mm-hmm.

1089
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,520
Yeah.

1090
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,280
Oh, you have a machine gun.

1091
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:15,500
And then Tab is your...

1092
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,020
Tab is your map.

1093
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:19,660
Tab is open.

1094
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:19,680
Yeah.

1095
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,780
He opens up your map.

1096
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,760
I'm gonna grab...

1097
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:21,860
Oh, yeah.

1098
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,980
Well, there's...

1099
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,360
Oh!

1100
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,500
So, basically, if you run out of ammo, we always like to get a resupply over here.

1101
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,480
Okay.

1102
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,380
Also, where is she?

1103
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,580
F is punch.

1104
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,680
F?

1105
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,840
You bitch!

1106
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,800
You bitch!

1107
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,240
V is your...

1108
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,620
V is your...

1109
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,180
What is it called?

1110
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,740
Stim.

1111
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,620
Oh.

1112
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:43,960
Oh.

1113
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,520
Okay.

1114
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,300
Yeah.

1115
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,100
And then you have your gun number one.

1116
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,760
Gun number two.

1117
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,160
Two.

1118
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,060
Also scroll wheel.

1119
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,540
Yeah.

1120
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,880
Oh, you can also scroll wheel it?

1121
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,040
You got it.

1122
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,140
Yeah.

1123
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1124
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,020
Right?

1125
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,920
You can scroll wheel the gun.

1126
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,220
Oh, wait.

1127
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,400
No.

1128
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,480
You can't scroll wheel the gun.

1129
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:58,880
I don't think so.

1130
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,320
My bad.

1131
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,780
Wrong game.

1132
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,180
Wrong game.

1133
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,740
Can I pick these up?

1134
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,220
Which ones?

1135
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,280
Oh, see?

1136
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,380
There's little bugs coming up.

1137
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,040
So, these little guys right here.

1138
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,180
I have no idea how to play this game.

1139
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,780
After bugs.

1140
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,540
After guys.

1141
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,960
You got to shoot them.

1142
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,580
It's been a while.

1143
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:15,940
It's been a while.

1144
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,420
You see that orange thing on the ground?

1145
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,480
That means it's a bug breach.

1146
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,920
So, they're coming up to attack us.

1147
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,380
Okay.

1148
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,120
That red thing is I'm summoning...

1149
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,340
Be careful.

1150
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,080
Stay away from that.

1151
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,460
Oh.

1152
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,540
I'm fine.

1153
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,200
Yeah.

1154
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,160
So, you'll see.

1155
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,720
You'll get there.

1156
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,320
It's a lot of fruit.

1157
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,660
Are we going to the orange thing?

1158
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Orange is the main mission.

1159
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,860
Usually, Haru and I like to like run around and do random stuff.

1160
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,800
Oh, nice.

1161
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,360
So, you guys can go to the orange thing.

1162
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,660
Oh.

1163
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,300
Tab.

1164
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:41,860
Okay.

1165
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,340
I see it.

1166
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,380
Tab.

1167
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,220
I know it's a little stressful at first.

1168
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,200
Feel free to ask anything.

1169
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,140
That's why...

1170
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,940
Yeah.

1171
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,220
Okay.

1172
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,600
What is a jellyfish?

1173
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,280
It's so cute.

1174
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,720
Yeah.

1175
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,880
There's different planets which do different stuff.

1176
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,600
Oh, we got super credits.

1177
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:55,980
Nice.

1178
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,460
Yeah.

1179
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,060
I got us some.

1180
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,900
I got you, bae.

1181
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,620
Whoa.

1182
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,220
Thank you.

1183
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,100
Got you super credits.

1184
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,720
Wow.

1185
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:01,740
Wow.

1186
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,060
Wow.

1187
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,460
That's a rock.

1188
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,140
The red...

1189
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,180
If you look at the map, there's like big red kind of...

1190
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:06,500
Yeah.

1191
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:06,780
Yeah.

1192
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,120
... stuff.

1193
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,040
Those are outposts.

1194
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,000
That's usually an enemy nest.

1195
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:09,860
Yeah.

1196
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,280
I blew up something and it exploded on me.

1197
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,480
Good.

1198
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,040
Good.

1199
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,720
Oh, don't worry.

1200
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,380
That's a...

1201
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,640
That means it likes you.

1202
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,940
... these weird little onion-looking...

1203
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,300
Yeah.

1204
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:19,500
Yeah.

1205
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:19,960
Those things.

1206
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
... nipply things.

1207
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,360
They look like onions to me.

1208
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,420
Yeah.

1209
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:22,720
Nipply, nipply.

1210
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,420
So, if you run into them, they create like this fog.

1211
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,080
And I think they help with avoiding the bugs because bugs rely on...

1212
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,460
Oh.

1213
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,320
Oh, they actually help you?

1214
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,080
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1215
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,320
I'm getting them except...

1216
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,440
The robots rely on sight.

1217
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,100
Bugs do not.

1218
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,540
Oh.

1219
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,840
Yeah.

1220
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,020
But also, I think it's like it slows the bugs down a little bit.

1221
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,480
Doesn't it?

1222
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,260
I do not know.

1223
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,960
I think it slows you down.

1224
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,460
I thought it slowed them down a little tiny bit.

1225
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,700
I forget.

1226
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,100
The big orange thing.

1227
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:47,900
Where do you aim?

1228
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,420
At the face?

1229
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,160
Or...

1230
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,040
You aim at his ass.

1231
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,620
No.

1232
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,320
Not the charger.

1233
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,160
The thick orange one that...

1234
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,740
Get his ass.

1235
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,460
Oh, his face.

1236
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,120
Get his ass.

1237
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,700
His face?

1238
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,500
Yeah.

1239
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,320
You aim...

1240
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,220
Oh, that guy over there.

1241
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,700
Minto, do you see this thing?

1242
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,080
Shoot him.

1243
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,640
Shoot him.

1244
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,800
Shoot him.

1245
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:07,940
Shoot him.

1246
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,280
Get him.

1247
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,700
Kill him.

1248
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,400
That thing over there?

1249
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,620
Shoot him.

1250
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,040
Shoot him.

1251
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,720
You see this thing?

1252
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,640
Do not shoot him.

1253
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,720
It's a hell bomb.

1254
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,580
Oh, okay.

1255
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,120
Shoot it.

1256
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,720
All right.

1257
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,260
So if I back up...

1258
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,720
Shoot him, Mint.

1259
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,700
Now you shoot at it.

1260
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,100
Let the demons win.

1261
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,780
This one?

1262
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,780
Now watch what happens.

1263
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,200
Oh.

1264
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:20,800
Yay.

1265
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:21,920
Woohoo.

1266
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,160
Yay.

1267
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,280
Yeah.

1268
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,120
Yeah.

1269
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:26,320
Yeah.

1270
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,580
That's really good for hordes.

1271
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,720
Oh, yeah.

1272
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,200
Democracy.

1273
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,580
Democracy.

1274
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,300
We love explosions.

1275
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,540
We love explosions.

1276
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,660
My samples.

1277
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,240
My samples.

1278
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,540
Samples is like what you take to upgrade your ship slowly.

1279
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,660
You're always going to need common samples forever.

1280
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,460
Where do you get the items?

1281
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,380
Where are you finding these?

1282
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,360
It's on the ground.

1283
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:50,900
Oh.

1284
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,160
Oh, do not go in there, Henya.

1285
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,720
Don't worry.

1286
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,260
You'll get better at spotting them, my love.

1287
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,020
Okay.

1288
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,100
Let's go.

1289
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,440
Woohoo.

1290
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,660
It, like, trust me, even me sometimes I have a hard time, like, running around and figuring out where I'm going.

1291
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,500
I got you.

1292
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,640
I got you.

1293
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:04,800
I got you.

1294
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:04,940
Oh, I got it.

1295
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,700
Nice!

1296
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,320
I got it.

1297
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,440
Nice!

1298
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,540
I dropped a grenade!

1299
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,380
My grenade!

1300
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,800
Did you guys see that sick throw that I didn't fuck up twice?

1301
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,620
How are you all the way over there?

1302
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,100
Who?

1303
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,060
Matara, you.

1304
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,640
I saw it.

1305
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:17,860
I saw it.

1306
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,660
I saw you throw two grenades over there.

1307
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:20,820
I saw you throw two grenades over there.

1308
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,280
Oh my God.

1309
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,140
You know what, Henya?

1310
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,000
No, no .

1311
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,120
Oh.

1312
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,840
Oh!

1313
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,260
Oh!

1314
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,300
I misplayed so bad!

1315
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,220
She's dead!

1316
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,860
So this is what you can do.

1317
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,200
So you can reinforce, Mint.

1318
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,300
Yeah, okay.

1319
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, try it, try it!

1320
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,520
What do I do?

1321
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,480
Nice saving my life.

1322
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,480
Control, and then you go up, down, right, left, up.

1323
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,140
Oh, up, down, right, up.

1324
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,480
What a gamer.

1325
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,680
I know, that was gaming.

1326
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,160
And then you yeet that to the fucking sky.

1327
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,880
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

1328
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,520
There you go!

1329
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,420
Come on!

1330
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,620
Come in!

1331
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,800
Come in!

1332
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,980
Watch out, you might dive into the helipod!

1333
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,880
I'm coming!

1334
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:55,940
Meow!

1335
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,980
Oh, there you are.

1336
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,920
This is meowing.

1337
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,800
Bug breach detected.

1338
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,720
So, Mint, you know how you, like, are low on supplies?

1339
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,680
Since I have a supply pack, I can give you a refill.

1340
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,620
Oh, okay, thanks!

1341
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,780
Wait, how do you know I'm low on supplies?

1342
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,860
Because the little diamond on your chest is glowing, it says give refill.

1343
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,520
It does?

1344
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,200
Yep, yep, yep.

1345
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,820
Oh, watch out!

1346
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,580
Watch out, watch out!

1347
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,400
Your chest revealed your secrets.

1348
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,020
Ahhh!

1349
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,820
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1350
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,880
I forgot I have the impact grenade.

1351
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,080
It's kind of harder to hit stuff.

1352
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,540
Oh, I think I'm dead?

1353
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,720
Okay, one second.

1354
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,580
She's dead, she's dead.

1355
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,660
I was killed by myself.

1356
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,220
I'll reinforce you in a minute.

1357
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,400
Take my eagle!

1358
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,380
Wait, where did he go?

1359
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,600
I have the impact grenade.

1360
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,700
Oh, I should have used the machine gun.

1361
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,140
You were right.

1362
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,240
One more, one more, one more.

1363
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,100
Take my grenade!

1364
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,580
Oh, wait, no!

1365
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,180
Get her, Hanya!

1366
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,080
Oh, shit!

1367
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:48,860
I'm right here!

1368
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,260
I'm right here!

1369
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,780
Good job!

1370
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:53,940
Nice!

1371
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,700
Alright, so over here, Min, you'll be a natural in no time, Min.

1372
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,280
Don't even sweat it.

1373
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,960
This is one of the missions.

1374
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,840
So if you open up your map, you see how it's orange?

1375
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,520
Yeah.

1376
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,380
That's one of the main missions.

1377
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:06,640
Oh!

1378
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,680
So this one is upload data, so basically do the stratagem thing, but you just see how it's going.

1379
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, I see it.

1380
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,060
And then you just basically stand here and protect the area.

1381
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:17,620
Oh, okay.

1382
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,560
I can do that.

1383
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,140
Until it uploads all the corn into that thing.

1384
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:21,340
Yep.

1385
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:21,600
Corn?

1386
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah, corn.

1387
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,340
What?

1388
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,180
Corn.

1389
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,640
No, no, no, no, no.

1390
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:28,740
Corn!

1391
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,460
This is the corn, the glowing pieces, right?

1392
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:31,840
Corn!

1393
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,240
Oh, Hanya, what's the word you learned the other day?

1394
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:36,820
I love corn.

1395
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,440
Canto!

1396
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,320
Wait, what?

1397
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,580
I'm serving canto!

1398
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,480
I tried to tell her not to, but...

1399
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,680
Oh, you're serving canto?

1400
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,720
I'm so proud of you, Hanya!

1401
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:47,920
Yay!

1402
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,040
Thank you!

1403
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,280
This is my day four serving canto!

1404
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,540
Can you jump?

1405
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:55,980
Canto!

1406
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
No, no, no, no, no.

1407
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,700
If you really want to emphasize that, you gotta say cant without the to.

1408
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,020
Canto!

1409
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,080
Yeah!

1410
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,580
That's what I'm talking about!

1411
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,440
Say hi to my wife!

1412
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,200
Both of my oshis are always serving.

1413
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,180
Wait, both?

1414
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,300
Who's your other oshi?

1415
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,340
Kiwawa!

1416
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,140
Oh, Kiwawa!

1417
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,420
Oh, it's true, she does!

1418
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,360
She's serving canto!

1419
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,260
Oh, there's throwing up on us!

1420
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,240
Shoot him at the face, bitch!

1421
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,460
I'm trying to run away!

1422
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,900
Wait, how do I get to my machine gun, you guys?

1423
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,260
You can see on your map if you maybe dropped it.

1424
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,400
Oh, I dropped it?

1425
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,920
Also, don't be afraid to use to use to jump out of attacks.

1426
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,880
If you notice that the monsters are coming in or they're shooting you or anything.

1427
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,020
Also, reload is like you should not do the reload until your ammo runs out too.

1428
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,520
Oh, okay.

1429
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,560
You know in some games, here if you have a little bit of ammo and you use it, it loses the full ammo pack.

1430
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, really?

1431
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,120
I know it feels overwhelming at first, baby, but don't worry.

1432
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,640
You'll get the hang of it real quick.

1433
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,140
I'm just shooting.

1434
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,180
I'm running and shooting.

1435
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Good, good, good.

1436
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,120
Running and shooting.

1437
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:16,720
That's my girl.

1438
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,680
Running and shooting.

1439
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,200
Running and shooting.

1440
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,940
Actually, I can give you a shield that's gonna help you.

1441
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,900
Yeah, let's do a...

1442
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,980
Haru, do you want to do the blue mission or show them?

1443
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,360
Oh, yeah.

1444
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,160
Let's get...

1445
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:39,560
Well, once you're done with the mission, the longer the mission goes, the harder it gets because there's more bugs that spawn.

1446
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,020
And at the end, the more bugs on the map come to you.

1447
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,580
But if you have extra time, you should always try to do side missions.

1448
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,180
So the blue on the map, if you open tab, you see a little blue thing?

1449
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,720
That's a side mission.

1450
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,460
So it's gonna give us a little bit more.

1451
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,360
You should come get your stuff over here, Mint, where I'm at.

1452
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,420
Wait, where are you?

1453
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,020
Yeah, exclamation mark, Mint.

1454
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,600
I see people in chat are wondering who Mint is.

1455
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,400
Exclamation mark, Mint.

1456
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,880
Hi, it's me!

1457
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,840
She's my pod gal.

1458
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,680
It's me, Mint!

1459
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,500
Come on, Mint!

1460
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,620
It's a Mint!

1461
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,300
Oh, shit!

1462
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,420
She's out here flaming!

1463
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:19,940
Wait, okay.

1464
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,420
I already have one, I think.

1465
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,780
Wait, how do I change?

1466
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,740
Okay, there we go.

1467
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,100
We're good.

1468
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,580
We're gonna make Mint do the mission.

1469
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,400
I wanna watch her suffer.

1470
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:30,860
Me?

1471
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,340
Yeah, it's not actually suffering, the mission.

1472
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,100
You're so cruel.

1473
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:36,960
Always, baby.

1474
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,360
I got you.

1475
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,040
I'm joking.

1476
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,460
I got you, baby girl.

1477
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,320
Mint, I don't think you heard me about this.

1478
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,220
What, am I here?

1479
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,160
I'm ready for this?

1480
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,320
This way, this way, this way.

1481
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,400
Go to this terminal.

1482
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:54,960
I'm here.

1483
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,540
I'm ready.

1484
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,640
I'm at the terminal.

1485
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,040
Touch that terminal!

1486
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,700
Put in the Kodami code once it shows up!

1487
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,960
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1488
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,280
Kodami code.

1489
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:06,820
Do it.

1490
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,340
Wait, what it is?

1491
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,440
Press E again.

1492
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,380
And then you press up.

1493
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,600
There you go.

1494
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,220
I hate always getting behind this little guy.

1495
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,480
Oh my god, this is me.

1496
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,660
I'm spreading lies on the internet.

1497
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,280
Stop spreading.

1498
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,660
I'm uploading lies.

1499
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,500
This one's a turning the tower.

1500
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,880
So do you see this thing rising up?

1501
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,280
Yes, I see it.

1502
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,420
Usually, this is a two-person mission.

1503
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:41,380
Because all you have to do is spin this thing and if you hear the beep on the terminal, then that means you have successfully aligned it.

1504
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,380
So Hennye will turn it and you can go back to the terminal and you can tell her which direction to turn it.

1505
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,320
I'll turn it, I'll turn it.

1506
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:49,820
Wait, how do I?

1507
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,520
Which way?

1508
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,700
You can go to the terminal, Mint.

1509
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,340
And then you can tell Hennye where to turn.

1510
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1511
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,200
I got this, I got this.

1512
00:48:59,420 --> 00:48:59,740
Um...

1513
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:01,820
You...

1514
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,780
The line is in between the dotted lines and this little colored area.

1515
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,340
That way.

1516
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,620
Wait, what?

1517
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:12,860
Um...

1518
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,140
There's a guy coming.

1519
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,860
I think I'm gonna die here.

1520
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,960
I think I'm gonna die here.

1521
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,360
I am yelling.

1522
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:21,940
Um...

1523
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,480
Would you forgive me if I summon a resupply?

1524
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:26,900
I would.

1525
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,660
I'm okay!

1526
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:30,900
I can't die.

1527
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,540
How far should I keep going?

1528
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,560
Um... I don't know.

1529
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,740
Wait!

1530
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,440
You're the one who's supposed to know about this!

1531
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,200
Right there.

1532
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,140
Wait.

1533
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,160
So you see how that was a colored area?

1534
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,100
That's where you have to put the...

1535
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,800
the tower in between.

1536
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,920
I don't know what I just did.

1537
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:51,760
But I did something.

1538
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,640
You did great!

1539
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,920
That's all you need to know!

1540
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,740
You did amazing!

1541
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,120
Yippee!

1542
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:57,900
Yippee!

1543
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,680
So if you open up your map and zoom out, you can see all those diamond shit.

1544
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,880
And all the things that we can clear.

1545
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,860
We can get all of them.

1546
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,080
Diamond shit!

1547
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,040
I'm gonna collect diamond shit!

1548
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,560
Tanya loves the treasures.

1549
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,300
Oh, watch out!

1550
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,300
I might need a...

1551
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,240
Wait, why can't I... Oh, reload.

1552
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,180
You might be out of ammo.

1553
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,000
Which is why I'm here!

1554
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,340
To give you resupply.

1555
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:29,780
Thanks.

1556
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,060
And now I'm out of my backpack.

1557
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:32,760
Uh-oh.

1558
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,640
Let's go get a diamond!

1559
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,740
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine!

1560
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,060
Are you sure you're good?

1561
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,560
Oh, I see I'm exploding things!

1562
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,700
Diving time!

1563
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,080
I am living my best life.

1564
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,120
It looks like you're in trouble, my friend.

1565
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,980
I'm here to help.

1566
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:50,780
Ow!

1567
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,720
I am shining bright like a diamond.

1568
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:55,620
I can't see shit.

1569
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,160
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1570
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,460
Where's the resupply?

1571
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,100
There's a supply over here.

1572
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,180
I don't think you can really see it because...

1573
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,220
Where's the resupply?

1574
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,240
Did I not summon it?

1575
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,360
There's a diamond over here.

1576
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,800
You guys, did I forget to summon the resupply?

1577
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,520
Did I screw it up?

1578
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,660
Oh, that's a thing.

1579
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,400
I just took the air strike.

1580
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,100
Is it on cooldown?

1581
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,020
I can't move with the fire!

1582
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,000
Here, I can summon it.

1583
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,700
Okay, yeah, perfect.

1584
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,720
I had forgotten to summon the resupply, my bad.

1585
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,460
I got your back.

1586
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,020
I think I'm dead!

1587
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:37,910
I got you, I got you!

1588
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:38,990
You're alive, you're alive.

1589
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:40,430
Thank you.

1590
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:42,090
No!

1591
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,010
Wait, wait, I'll call...

1592
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,100
I already called, I already called, no worries.

1593
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,680
I got a stim.

1594
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,580
Can I get another resupply?

1595
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,880
I got up to six damage.

1596
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:01,920
Hold on.

1597
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,500
Feed mommy.

1598
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,480
Wait, wait.

1599
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,080
Here you go.

1600
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:07,240
Okay.

1601
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:07,740
Give me.

1602
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,300
Thanks, baby.

1603
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:08,800
Did it work?

1604
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,440
Yeah, it did work!

1605
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,140
Thank you!

1606
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:12,980
Okay!

1607
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,440
You're doing great, Mint.

1608
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,400
You're doing really good, Mint.

1609
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,260
I didn't do anything.

1610
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:23,360
At first, you just gotta get used to the positioning and stuff like that, right?

1611
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,040
I'm gonna go get the stuff that you dropped back here.

1612
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,580
All the white icons?

1613
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,440
Yeah!

1614
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,380
Oh, I'll come with.

1615
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,600
Oh yeah, Mint, Mint, Mint.

1616
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,800
Next game, I'm gonna summon a shield for you.

1617
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,880
It's gonna help you a bit with getting hurt.

1618
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,960
It's gonna do a little bit more damage and then it respawns.

1619
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,420
It's cause she's far now.

1620
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,380
Oh, woah.

1621
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,080
Woah, woah, woah.

1622
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,440
Oh no!

1623
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,640
Have fun!

1624
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,980
This is level three!

1625
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:54,500
This is level three!

1626
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,160
So sometimes when we get into big bug fights, like when the bug breach happened or anything, we, usually what we do is like we alternate using our big abilities.

1627
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:02,980
Oh my god!

1628
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:03,800
Yeah?

1629
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,660
I'm listening.

1630
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,640
Which is like when you fall in from the ship.

1631
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,600
That really helps.

1632
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,200
I died.

1633
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,860
Who wants to reinforce her?

1634
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:12,900
I'm busy!

1635
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,860
I'm far from you guys.

1636
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:16,400
I got it!

1637
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:16,860
I got it!

1638
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:18,920
Oh wait.

1639
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,780
I got it!

1640
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,940
I did it!

1641
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:23,280
I did it!

1642
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,360
Are my egos forever?

1643
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,260
Cause I feel like I've had so many of them.

1644
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,460
Egos are unlimited.

1645
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,060
Oh, I didn't realize.

1646
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,480
There's a lot of guys.

1647
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,700
Oh yeah, that's why I'm always...

1648
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,320
I love egos.

1649
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,620
It's so good for the...

1650
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,860
Yeah, for clearing the nests.

1651
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,120
Looking for the samples while I'm here.

1652
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah!

1653
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,120
I hate spears.

1654
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:45,820
Reinforcement!

1655
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,160
Where's my samples?

1656
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,480
You guys see them?

1657
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,780
Oh no!

1658
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,420
Oh shoot.

1659
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:53,880
Oh shoot.

1660
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,740
I think I'm in trouble.

1661
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:55,640
I think I'm in trouble!

1662
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,220
You're fine.

1663
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,900
You're fine.

1664
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,380
Take my ego!

1665
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,580
Take my ego!

1666
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,400
Oh my god.

1667
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,600
Oh I'm dead.

1668
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,220
I'm so dead!

1669
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:04,780
Hahaha!

1670
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,020
Did I kill you?

1671
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,340
Sorry, baby!

1672
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,520
Oh, I think you'll rearm.

1673
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,200
Penga, that's really soft!

1674
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,700
Well, I summoned you, okay?

1675
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,180
That's really soft!

1676
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,480
I'm the one who summoned you, Penga.

1677
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:20,900
No!

1678
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,940
It's called mistakes, you know?

1679
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,540
Mistakes were made.

1680
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,260
Is there a good way to see where I dropped my stuff?

1681
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,020
Mistakes were made.

1682
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,820
Yeah, if you look at your map, it's gonna show you where your stuff was.

1683
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,300
What does it look like?

1684
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,520
Maybe that?

1685
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,440
It looks like a gun!

1686
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,940
It looks like the icons of your stratagems, for example.

1687
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,860
It looks like a gun.

1688
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,180
I love that.

1689
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,300
No, I think I helped.

1690
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,320
The yellow symbol.

1691
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,200
Oh, yeah!

1692
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,700
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.

1693
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,420
Yeah, trust me.

1694
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,340
Even I completely lose myself in this game.

1695
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:56,740
What's this?

1696
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,580
I play it quite a bit.

1697
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,800
Oh, someone's machine gun.

1698
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,740
Oh my god, the stupid impact grenades!

1699
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,700
Is it mine?

1700
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,760
Oh my god, I missed every single shot that I took.

1701
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,240
It was mine.

1702
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,000
I cannot believe this.

1703
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,920
This is my gun.

1704
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,680
Mata, do you require assistance?

1705
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,380
I have one big impact grenade left!

1706
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,300
And I missed it.

1707
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,700
Sweet liberty!

1708
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,240
Liberty, liberty!

1709
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,360
Come here for a second, actually.

1710
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,540
This actually works out.

1711
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,040
This here is called a friendship door.

1712
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,380
I'm coming.

1713
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,360
I have a minute and a half left before my other stuff pops up.

1714
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,740
It's fine.

1715
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,820
What's this thing?

1716
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,780
Go to that yellow thing.

1717
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,740
And you and Hennia hit it at the same time.

1718
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,200
You don't have to count down, but Hennia can hit it.

1719
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:41,820
Where is it?

1720
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,000
Come here, man.

1721
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,480
This way, this way.

1722
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,180
We're teaching men how to play this game.

1723
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:49,940
Down there.

1724
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1725
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,580
Ready?

1726
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:55,700
Nice!

1727
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,360
Now you can get the shit in there.

1728
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,360
It's the shit!

1729
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,720
Yeah, what Hennia said.

1730
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,540
It's the shit!

1731
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,640
What's in there?

1732
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:07,800
Shit!

1733
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,580
Well, there's grenades in here.

1734
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,100
Oh, we got breakfast system slips, which is really nice, too.

1735
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:13,220
Oh, I forgot.

1736
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,240
I have to use my grenades.

1737
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,580
You can shoot the cylinders that sparks.

1738
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,740
Oh, thank you.

1739
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,380
I had no idea.

1740
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,500
There's... oh, no.

1741
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,240
Oh, there's little buddies that are dead here.

1742
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:24,820
Hi, guys.

1743
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,480
33 seconds.

1744
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,700
He's fine.

1745
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:27,840
He's fine.

1746
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,100
Oh, no!

1747
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:31,820
Oh!

1748
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,320
Oh, the other cylinders.

1749
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,400
Thank you.

1750
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,220
Alright, 20 seconds.

1751
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,860
Hey, Mint?

1752
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,480
Yeah?

1753
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,280
Can you come here for a second?

1754
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,140
What if I throw my arc thrower in there?

1755
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,860
This is going to be a weird request.

1756
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,460
Can you punch me?

1757
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,820
Do you think that's going to work?

1758
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,340
I'm stuck.

1759
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,100
There you go.

1760
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,600
Thank you.

1761
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:54,640
Thanks.

1762
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,100
Yeah.

1763
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,000
I don't think it worked.

1764
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,000
I don't have a good punch.

1765
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,440
Only bloodied a little bit.

1766
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,340
I might have broken two of my ankles.

1767
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,300
This might be a dumb question, but will I die in the fire?

1768
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,340
Yes.

1769
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,240
I'm missing a grenade, so I can't...

1770
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,200
Okay, there we go.

1771
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,500
Never mind.

1772
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,300
Thank you.

1773
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,240
I'm sorry.

1774
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,980
I had already summoned the eagle when she came in.

1775
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,180
Oh, yeah.

1776
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,160
I'm going to summon you a shield.

1777
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:27,540
Okay?

1778
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,280
Where are you?

1779
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,280
I'm here.

1780
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:29,520
I'm here.

1781
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,240
Yeah, you'll see the little shield.

1782
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,120
This?

1783
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:34,800
Wait, wait, wait.

1784
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,300
Let it drop.

1785
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:35,680
Let it drop.

1786
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,480
Don't stand under it.

1787
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,880
I should have let you stand under it.

1788
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,540
I was like, wow, that's a cool looking shield.

1789
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,220
Wow.

1790
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:50,180
See, like right now, I have to apply to you, but it's touching the shield instead of you.

1791
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,940
So you can handle it.

1792
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,140
Oh, by the way, this is a bug breach.

1793
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:53,940
Do you see it right there?

1794
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:54,900
It's a bug breach, baby.

1795
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,220
What's a bug breach?

1796
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,740
So usually the bugs, it's like little patrols that they send.

1797
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,720
So when you see that, that means you're getting attacked by like a group of bugs, which is fine.

1798
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,740
It happens quite often.

1799
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,860
It happens, you know.

1800
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,080
I'm going to go get the shinies.

1801
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:08,700
It's just life.

1802
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,420
It's my cousin.

1803
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,840
He's shiny.

1804
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,020
I'm going to go get the shinies, too.

1805
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,540
Bata, you have to protect Mindanaar behind.

1806
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,420
Is it...

1807
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,160
Oh, my God.

1808
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:20,660
I'm going to die.

1809
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,360
I'm going to die.

1810
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:22,640
Just run.

1811
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,080
Just run.

1812
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,500
If you're like outnumbered, just run.

1813
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,460
I'm trying to run.

1814
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,300
Just keep running.

1815
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:27,680
Keep running.

1816
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,580
You have a friendship door that I need to...

1817
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,480
Run and then turn back in front of it.

1818
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,460
That's usually the way.

1819
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,220
You run and gun into us and then we run and gun and help.

1820
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,920
I have a Harunya door to open.

1821
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,820
It is what it is.

1822
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,240
And now I'm here for Harunya!

1823
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,900
I think Harunya is cute, but I think Hentara is better.

1824
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,400
That's my favorite ship, Hentara.

1825
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,320
I think that's...

1826
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,100
I think you're wise.

1827
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,140
Bata, I thought you were trying to get my visa.

1828
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,680
Yeah, you're trying to get our visa.

1829
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,120
Yeah, my visa.

1830
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:09,940
My precious visa.

1831
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,920
You got good shit in there, Harunya.

1832
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,660
I mean...

1833
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,700
You know.

1834
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,740
If one doesn't help the other, I can think you're very cute.

1835
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,640
Come here.

1836
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,760
Shoot this explosive barrel right here.

1837
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,460
I'm gonna go over here and shoot it.

1838
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:26,540
Where?

1839
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,560
This red one?

1840
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,220
This one?

1841
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,220
I'm gonna make our way down.

1842
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,380
Where are we going, Nagin?

1843
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,040
I would run away if I were you.

1844
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,400
Oh, we got some stuff though.

1845
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:39,780
What's that?

1846
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,300
Oh, the blue one!

1847
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,220
Hey, that's my stuff!

1848
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,300
Don't touch my stuff!

1849
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,740
This is some cool stuff!

1850
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,000
Wow!

1851
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,420
Nice!

1852
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,700
Yeah, I'm gonna just...

1853
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,820
Stop touching my stuff!

1854
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,260
I think it's just ammo.

1855
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:55,800
Time to go.

1856
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:03,240
Also, get into the habit if somebody dies in front of you just to resummon them right away.

1857
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,740
Extraction is available.

1858
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,160
It would be a good habit.

1859
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,920
Wait, how do I use your gun?

1860
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,020
I took your gun and I know how to use it!

1861
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:15,440
It doesn't have bullets, so you can shoot it and then you have to let it cool down.

1862
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,880
Like it gets red because it's an energy gun.

1863
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,340
Oh!

1864
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,280
But it's good because you don't have bullets.

1865
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,040
Can I get summoned back, please?

1866
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,300
Oh, Mint, you got this.

1867
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,300
I think I'm gonna die.

1868
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,100
I think I'm in trouble.

1869
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,460
I think I'm in trouble a little bit.

1870
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:30,720
You got this, Mint.

1871
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,460
I believe in you.

1872
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,120
I have no gun.

1873
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,620
Wait, maybe this one.

1874
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:37,940
Oh, this one.

1875
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,360
I'm sorry, I just found the penis clock and I'm excited.

1876
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,660
Don't call it that.

1877
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,020
We're in polite society.

1878
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,800
We're in polite society.

1879
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,660
That doesn't look like it!

1880
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,040
That doesn't look like it!

1881
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,300
Don't call it that, Mint, please.

1882
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,640
She's gonna get embarrassed.

1883
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,700
That person needs to go to the hospital!

1884
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,600
How's that any different?

1885
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,500
What's happening?

1886
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,600
That means slay!

1887
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,980
Mouse told me about it!

1888
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,060
Slay!

1889
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,100
Don't say it to your father.

1890
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,840
She was asking if she could say that to her dad.

1891
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,680
What about if I already did?

1892
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,360
Then what did he say?

1893
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,920
Oh, he was laughing about it.

1894
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,840
Who told you that?

1895
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,800
I told my dad and I said mouse.

1896
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,980
He was like, oh, is that the one girl who played Fortnite?

1897
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:22,980
And she's fine.

1898
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:23,800
She's cool.

1899
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,040
Because he loves Fortnite.

1900
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,420
Oh, he's not like other dads.

1901
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,120
He's a cool dad.

1902
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,620
I'm sorry, I dropped your stuff.

1903
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,300
It's fine, it's fine.

1904
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,360
You guys want to go to the extraction zone?

1905
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,020
He was claiming himself GigaChad.

1906
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,160
He's a GigaChad?

1907
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,840
Alright, I'm gonna start...

1908
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,860
Okay, uh...

1909
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,540
Mint and Henya, come with me.

1910
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,160
Once you're done with the main mission, do you see the blue light on your map?

1911
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,460
You can also find it on your map, but that's where we gotta go.

1912
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:55,560
We gotta defend that zone for about two minutes.

1913
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:56,980
I don't see a blue light.

1914
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,880
Do you see, like right in front of you, do you see there's a blue light going up to the sky?

1915
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,440
Oh, that one!

1916
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1917
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,860
So we're gonna run to it, because there's no...

1918
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,020
Once you've collected mostly everything, there's not really a use.

1919
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:10,940
I'm getting the other two.

1920
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,900
What do you think?

1921
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,220
I'm getting the other two.

1922
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,540
Also, Mint, when I first played, all I did was run after people.

1923
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,780
So don't worry if it takes you a little moment to, like, get used to the game.

1924
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,700
I've been shooting...

1925
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,860
That's what I still do.

1926
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,860
I still run after people.

1927
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:30,840
Yeah.

1928
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,620
Yeah, I was full of people, because I don't know where to go.

1929
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,400
This is why I invited Haruka.

1930
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,360
Because I'm okay with doing missions, but I needed somebody who's, like, good with doing missions.

1931
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:41,680
Hi!

1932
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:42,920
I'm Fisa.

1933
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,320
You're great.

1934
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,300
I'm not your god gamer.

1935
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,960
She's a god gamer.

1936
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,020
When we play on high difficulty, Haruka's soloing.

1937
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,260
She's doing crazy stuff.

1938
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,700
Get him, Mint.

1939
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,660
I'm mowing him down!

1940
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,520
Mowing him down!

1941
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,140
Okay, kill the one with the orange.

1942
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:02,960
He's summoning more.

1943
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,020
Oh, this guy?

1944
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,400
But it's okay.

1945
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,300
When you see him, like, poop orange into the air, it's because he's summoning guys.

1946
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:13,740
Don't worry.

1947
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,380
I'm fine.

1948
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,180
I just think it just went down the wrong tube.

1949
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:19,620
You okay?

1950
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:21,380
It happened.

1951
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,800
So I don't want to scare you girls, but we're about to get a lot of bugs.

1952
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:30,960
They're all about to come to us, which is why you should always try to finish the missions not super late on high difficulty.

1953
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:33,360
Don't spit on me!

1954
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,900
I think we'll be fine on level 3.

1955
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,360
Oh yeah, we'll be more than fine.

1956
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,520
I was gonna say, I think we should turn it up a bit.

1957
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:39,780
Oh!

1958
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,500
Oh god, I think that'd be super funny.

1959
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,400
Let's try 4 and then we'll see how it goes.

1960
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:48,380
RELOAD!

1961
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:49,900
OUCH!

1962
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:50,600
OUCH!

1963
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,660
I wish I had my machine gun!

1964
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:57,440
Eagle!

1965
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,040
You can summon another one.

1966
01:03:59,220 --> 01:03:59,880
Oh my god.

1967
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,700
They go on cooldown.

1968
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,560
They go on cooldown.

1969
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:05,900
Summon the one you want.

1970
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,340
I'm getting tackled by this guy.

1971
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,080
Run towards us.

1972
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:17,780
If you're in a situation where you're getting attacked a lot, run towards your allies because they will be able to shoot the bugs off.

1973
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:18,640
Yeah, you're right.

1974
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:19,220
You're so right.

1975
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,420
And sometimes a grenade is faster than other stuff.

1976
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:24,300
True!

1977
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,520
I keep forgetting to throw my grenades.

1978
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:27,900
That's okay.

1979
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,860
Trust me, it's pretty overwhelming the first time.

1980
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,200
But you're doing really good.

1981
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,380
Oh, by the way, don't worry about the timer.

1982
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,780
It's just letting us know how much time we have left to use the stratagem.

1983
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,740
I'll be honest, I didn't even see a timer.

1984
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,440
Now I feel stressed.

1985
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,240
No, I'm just kidding.

1986
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:53,180
Now I feel stress and anxiety.

1987
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,500
Yeah, I could have lived without that knowledge.

1988
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:58,400
That information.

1989
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:03,360
I can't believe you would be this insensitive to my feelings.

1990
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,780
Sorry, it's just the Canadian in me.

1991
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:07,780
Sorry.

1992
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,260
Sorry.

1993
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,480
It's just the Canadian that's coming out.

1994
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,280
Is it too late now to say sorry?

1995
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:16,800
Probably.

1996
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,000
It's funny because that guy is smaller than just your body.

1997
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,020
I'm missing your clear landing zone.

1998
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,680
They're very delicious.

1999
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,120
I think we cleared it.

2000
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:35,820
Yeah, I was gonna say, I think level 3 might be a little too easy.

2001
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,260
I had to get ready for a bunch of bugs and it was kind of mid.

2002
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,820
Okay, girl, we'll put you on 5.

2003
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,860
We'll put you on 5.

2004
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:44,600
Mid Tara.

2005
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,220
I am pretty mid, I'm not gonna lie.

2006
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,780
I am the equivalent of mid.

2007
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,940
I am the equivalent of mid.

2008
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,280
I was like, it's here!

2009
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,900
If people ever want to call me something, like make fun of my name, they can call me mid to mid.

2010
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:02,700
Press C.

2011
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,460
Then just go in.

2012
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:05,280
Nice!

2013
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:07,360
Look at you crawl!

2014
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,780
I noticed she was stuck, so...

2015
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,100
Makes first mission!

2016
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:13,880
Yay!

2017
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,300
We survived!

2018
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:16,960
Yahoo!

2019
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:30,900
I am impressed because when my first time didn't kill me like 100 times on my first play and nobody kill each other.

2020
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,080
This is amazing!

2021
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,180
This is amazing!

2022
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,760
The night is young, Henya.

2023
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,860
I'm full of dangers.

2024
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,100
Uh oh.

2025
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,780
We got 3 stars, we did everything.

2026
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:43,840
Yippee!

2027
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:44,680
Yippee!

2028
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,880
That's true, Mint, you did kill me.

2029
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,280
Henya, Mint killed me.

2030
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,600
I did?

2031
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,220
Remember when you shot the barrel and I died?

2032
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:56,940
That was really cool.

2033
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,600
That was me?

2034
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:58,940
Yeah!

2035
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,340
You shot the barrel, Mint.

2036
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,380
You told me to.

2037
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,420
I was just being a good listener.

2038
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,260
Who knew that Helldivers is so much easier when we're not playing with Zentreya?

2039
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,560
Because she kills us all the time, Mint.

2040
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:19,380
I remember they kill me every single time and so many times.

2041
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,780
I'm not even bloody.

2042
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,080
But just a little bit bloody.

2043
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,820
I've seen some things in my time.

2044
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,540
Okay, Mint with a 71% accuracy.

2045
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,360
You have the highest accuracy of all of us, Mint.

2046
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:33,860
Let's go!

2047
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,880
199 friendly damage.

2048
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,520
See, I told you I was good at gun game.

2049
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,120
Pew pew.

2050
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,920
Pew pew, okay.

2051
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,460
You don't have it.

2052
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,400
I know, I know, I know.

2053
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,120
I have the most accuracy.

2054
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,940
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

2055
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,700
I was immediately gunned for it.

2056
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,540
I was so used to it.

2057
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,500
I was like, oh it's that thing.

2058
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:01,920
I'm not here anymore.

2059
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,400
Do I just return to ship?

2060
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,300
Oh yeah, I'm about to pick a harder mission.

2061
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:07,980
You stay here, Mint.

2062
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:11,660
Oh, we'll give you a fun mission.

2063
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,820
Wait, how do I do emote again?

2064
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,240
Don't return to ship.

2065
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,320
Oh yeah, it's alright.

2066
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,080
I got confuzzled.

2067
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,380
You're still on 3?

2068
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,340
We're about to change it.

2069
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,720
Try her on 9?

2070
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,800
I don't even enjoy 9.

2071
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:28,160
I think I'm ready.

2072
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,420
Mint, Mint, look, look, look.

2073
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:32,700
Your friends put me on level 9.

2074
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,940
I have now PTSD.

2075
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2076
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:38,600
Can I not change the difficulty in here?

2077
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,200
Nope.

2078
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,300
You have to leave the world.

2079
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,400
And then be able to change it.

2080
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,160
Oh my god, are you good?

2081
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,920
It's okay, I want your blood on me.

2082
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,140
You know, you can go back to the ice planet.

2083
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:49,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2084
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,560
Yay, blood!

2085
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,840
Nice, nice, thank you.

2086
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,100
How do you emote?

2087
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:01,520
B.

2088
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:02,820
B?

2089
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,360
B for bitches.

2090
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,160
I just do this.

2091
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,380
I do like a fist.

2092
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,320
So do you see the acquisitions on your top?

2093
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:20,780
So you press R and it shows you the different battle passes, but they're permanent so you can always get them.

2094
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,860
So this is where you get your guns and emote and stuff like that.

2095
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,880
So that's where we get most of our gear and stuff.

2096
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:28,580
Like this one.

2097
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:36,000
And you'll be able, as you keep playing with us, that's why I was doing all the side missions while you guys were running around.

2098
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,720
So that way we have more money to spend.

2099
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,020
Yay, nice.

2100
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,820
Money, money, money.

2101
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,440
Money, money, money.

2102
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:47,960
Money, money, money.

2103
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:51,410
Nah,

2104
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,730
I like my impact grenades.

2105
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,750
I don't want to switch them off.

2106
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,030
Yeah, I like them a lot too.

2107
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:00,170
This one is different.

2108
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,230
So this one is a 15 minute mission.

2109
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:04,510
Oh, it says clicking.

2110
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:07,510
Usually when people get into that screen, people like to be like, let's drop here.

2111
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:08,770
And then they just spam everything.

2112
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,250
It's just to be annoying.

2113
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:10,970
I don't even know.

2114
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:14,670
I've been doing that since the beginning and then I infected all my friends with it.

2115
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,310
She's been a little annoying since the beginning.

2116
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:17,970
That's her Haru.

2117
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:20,130
Big kiss.

2118
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:22,370
Big kiss.

2119
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,470
We can try robots after two minutes.

2120
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:31,250
Oh no, it's a robot.

2121
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:31,870
Uh oh.

2122
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,010
Are we killing?

2123
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:37,650
I'm ready to kill.

2124
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,050
I've never done this mission before, I think.

2125
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,450
How do you see what the mission is?

2126
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:42,610
Press Q.

2127
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:45,770
Press Q and then you'll see.

2128
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:46,830
Retrieve essential personnel.

2129
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:52,330
The Terminate Advance has swarmed across this region leaving one of our top secret research stations surrounded by the enemy.

2130
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:57,950
Use your clearance to unlock the emergency bunker doors and defend the facility staff as they enter to the evacuation shuttle.

2131
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:00,670
Oh, is this the one where you print scientists?

2132
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:02,710
We create people?

2133
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:03,810
Yeah.

2134
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:06,950
You basically, like, you click a button and then the people come out.

2135
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:07,950
So you just gotta print them.

2136
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:10,010
It's great.

2137
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:15,550
This is the Clone Wars after all, my love.

2138
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:18,590
Here we go.

2139
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,410
Am I a clone?

2140
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:22,990
Yeah!

2141
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,910
You're a clone of yourself!

2142
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,980
How do I use stims on people?

2143
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,720
Ah, so you go to them and it says use stims.

2144
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,740
Oh wow, that's handy.

2145
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:55,780
But only when they're low health.

2146
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:03,420
Oh yeah, speaking of stims, even if you have like, even like if you tripped on a rock and have like the minimal, like...

2147
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,400
Why am I slowed?

2148
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:04,980
Why am I slowed?

2149
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:05,040
Why am I slowed?

2150
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:10,160
Like for example, if you trip and have like a little damage done to you, I always recommend stimming.

2151
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,340
It's always important to have...

2152
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,060
I'm always out here stimming, Haruka.

2153
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:16,740
Me too!

2154
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:17,580
I'm fine.

2155
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:26,600
But it's always good to use your stim because it gives you once you stim, you have like a few seconds of immunity as well.

2156
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:32,720
So I always stim even though if I tripped on a rock and I'm like I have a boo-boo, I just stim that shit.

2157
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,120
That's better.

2158
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,580
Boo-boo!

2159
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,720
Fire in the hole!

2160
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:41,520
Fire in the hole!

2161
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,240
I didn't know you were an Overwatch gamer.

2162
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,100
I hate it here.

2163
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:49,080
I didn't know she was Junkrat.

2164
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,140
Honestly, Mint and Junkrat do have a lot of similarities.

2165
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:54,080
What's that?

2166
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,520
Junkrat is the character in Overwatch that says Fire in the hole!

2167
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,700
And that's just like me?

2168
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:02,880
Yeah.

2169
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,540
He's an annoying little Australian...

2170
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:07,660
Rat.

2171
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:14,300
I never played I scuttle around and I'm like That's like a PvP game, right?

2172
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:15,760
Yup.

2173
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,160
Overwatch is a PvP game.

2174
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:23,580
I used to like Overwatch and Overwatch 1, but now I despise Overwatch.

2175
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:24,620
Why?

2176
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:25,420
What happened?

2177
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,740
Oh my god, that's so dramatic.

2178
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,560
No, I'm being honest.

2179
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:30,980
Overwatch 1 was heaps better.

2180
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:35,180
Overwatch 2 just completely... what really pissed me off was Overwatch 2.

2181
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,660
Entire premise of its existence was to do PvE, story-based.

2182
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,860
Then they cancelled that shit.

2183
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:49,400
And then all they did is it's basically the same game, but like we're gonna remove one slot, so instead of six it's five people to play.

2184
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:53,700
Like, the changes they've done to Overwatch 2 pisses me the fuck off.

2185
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,940
I hate Overwatch.

2186
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,400
I used to play Overwatch every day!

2187
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:59,680
I used to laugh over it.

2188
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,380
Guys, I'm sorry, we...

2189
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,280
This is it.

2190
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:08,840
Howard, if you're listening, I would love to get sponsored to watch the Fallout series.

2191
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:12,080
Please do not take Haruka's words into your heart.

2192
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,960
No, the Fallout TV series is great.

2193
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:15,940
I've been watching a few.

2194
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:17,460
I finished it!

2195
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,160
I finished it!

2196
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:18,780
I watched it!

2197
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,780
It was so good!

2198
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,560
I haven't seen it yet.

2199
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,280
You watched it?

2200
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,200
Henya, did you play Fallout?

2201
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,160
The thing is, you can watch the...

2202
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,560
I heard it's real good.

2203
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,500
Yeah, I love it.

2204
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,840
What do you watch it on?

2205
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,460
It's on Amazon.

2206
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:35,780
Amazon Prime!

2207
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,320
You can what?

2208
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,900
You can watch the TV shows without knowing anything about Overwatch.

2209
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,080
Oh yeah, that is true!

2210
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:44,880
You enjoy it a lot.

2211
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,140
Fallout!

2212
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:53,140
I meant Fallout!

2213
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,000
Fallout, Fallout, Fallout!

2214
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,200
Lots of Fallout!

2215
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,680
In a radioactive world!

2216
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:04,060
But yeah, that's why I don't like Overwatch.

2217
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,600
I'm so sorry if you like it.

2218
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,840
That's just my opinion.

2219
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:11,540
How dare you have a different opinion than me.

2220
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,540
I'm gonna throw a grenade.

2221
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,380
Also, I mean, everything you said is valid.

2222
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,200
You pressed G.

2223
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,000
I don't think it works.

2224
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,980
Oh, check your grenades at the bottom left.

2225
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,700
Do you have 0 out of 4 grenades?

2226
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,760
Did you use all your grenades?

2227
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:26,420
No, I have 3.

2228
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,880
Oh my goodness, there's a lot going on here.

2229
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,540
Oh wait guys, I forgot this is only a 15 minute mission.

2230
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:32,760
Oopsies, I'll come to you.

2231
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,920
I was out here running around, but it's a 15 minute mission.

2232
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:36,200
Me too.

2233
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:38,280
What are we supposed to be doing?

2234
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,800
We have to go to the orange thing.

2235
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:40,860
Orange thing.

2236
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,220
I completely forgot.

2237
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,100
I'll meet you guys there.

2238
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:44,720
Are you okay?

2239
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,960
I got you, I got you!

2240
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:50,800
Grenade!

2241
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:52,760
Grenade!

2242
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,460
I keep throwing in like terrible...

2243
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:57,480
I thought you could aim it, so I was like...

2244
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,260
Yeah, I'm sort of...

2245
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,300
You'll get the hang of it.

2246
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,600
And then some grenades explode in a little bit.

2247
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:04,760
Whoa!

2248
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:06,640
Nice!

2249
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:07,960
Ow!

2250
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,040
My body!

2251
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,520
What just happened?

2252
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,980
What just happened?

2253
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,140
We have to escort 35 people.

2254
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,500
I don't know what... I think the game lied to me.

2255
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,720
It said I was killed by Henya.

2256
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,040
Wait, what?

2257
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,520
No way.

2258
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,980
I think the game lied.

2259
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,980
There's no way that Henya would kill me.

2260
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,700
I think the game is bugged.

2261
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,840
The game is bugged.

2262
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,300
Don't worry.

2263
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:35,100
I think that's called copium.

2264
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:37,920
No, it's not.

2265
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,300
Isn't getting killed by your urchin kind of precious, though?

2266
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,260
People would pay a lot of money for that.

2267
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:43,300
Exactly what I've always wanted.

2268
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:44,780
Yeah, there we go.

2269
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:46,500
Yeah, not gonna lie.

2270
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,640
Alright, I've never seen this mission before.

2271
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:49,640
Where's my gun?

2272
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,800
Over there, Mata, there will be like...

2273
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,540
I will teach you the ways, Mata.

2274
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,000
Yeah, I've never seen this mission before.

2275
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,240
I think we just skipped past the 7 pretty quickly.

2276
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,100
So over here...

2277
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,040
Oh, at the bottom, right?

2278
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:01,420
The computer?

2279
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,240
Yeah, there's this little button.

2280
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,900
You press it and three people come out.

2281
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,220
It's the printing button.

2282
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,520
I'll just start pressing.

2283
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:10,340
I'm coming.

2284
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:13,920
Do not shoot the little people walking, by the way, you guys.

2285
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Don't shoot the little people.

2286
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,200
Shoot him!

2287
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,360
I'm gonna shoot him!

2288
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,440
Kill them all!

2289
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,080
Democracy!

2290
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:22,920
Democracy!

2291
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,460
I think that's communism.

2292
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,400
That's not very democratic of you.

2293
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,680
Oh, uh, Haru?

2294
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:34,500
Yes?

2295
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,080
Where are you?

2296
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,860
Because one of us needs to be on the end.

2297
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:38,580
You're where?

2298
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,300
I'm on the other computer.

2299
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,060
The bugs are coming from here.

2300
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:44,720
What's this?

2301
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,680
Okay, girls, girls, come here, both of you.

2302
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,760
Girls, girls, girls.

2303
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,380
You're gonna press this button every time it's available.

2304
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,540
One of you presses the button.

2305
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,900
One of you defends near it.

2306
01:17:56,460 --> 01:17:57,540
Oh my god, little people!

2307
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,280
Where's the button?

2308
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,060
Oh, this button, this button.

2309
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2310
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,340
How do you know when it's available?

2311
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,080
Lights up?

2312
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,200
It'll blow.

2313
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:11,520
Look at him running around.

2314
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,080
These stupid little people.

2315
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:19,320
They don't know how to play with a bug.

2316
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,940
They're dumb little clones.

2317
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:22,580
Fuck you.

2318
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,660
Just any time you have the button, just press it.

2319
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,120
Okay.

2320
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:26,860
Just any time you can.

2321
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,220
Oh, it's ready!

2322
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,140
Push the button!

2323
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,420
Create people!

2324
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,140
My children!

2325
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,080
My children!

2326
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:36,640
Yeah, you're a mother now.

2327
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:37,120
Congrats.

2328
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,860
Oh, I'm not ready for this responsibility.

2329
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:40,820
It only created three.

2330
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna keep creating three.

2331
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,040
So just keep...

2332
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,980
And Haru and I are gonna defend on each side.

2333
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,880
You guys can shit out six people at a time.

2334
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:50,460
Yeah.

2335
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,120
Wait, there's another computer?

2336
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:52,820
Six people!

2337
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:53,900
Well, no, no.

2338
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:54,900
You stay at the one you're at.

2339
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:55,400
Okay.

2340
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,280
You keep doing at the one you're at.

2341
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,240
Oh, I see the other one.

2342
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,240
Wait, should I go to it?

2343
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:01,740
No, I got it.

2344
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,020
Yeah, I'm doing the other one.

2345
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:08,300
La la la.

2346
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:09,480
More people.

2347
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,080
Come out, little scientist.

2348
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:11,900
It's the helldivers!

2349
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,500
Why do you run like that?

2350
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:13,960
Come on.

2351
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,400
Come on.

2352
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,260
Get in shape.

2353
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:18,260
Get in shape.

2354
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:18,840
Come on, diet.

2355
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,620
How many people do we need?

2356
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:22,960
A lot.

2357
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,460
18 out of 35.

2358
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:26,520
18 out of 35.

2359
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,340
That's all right.

2360
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:28,780
We got this.

2361
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,340
Come on, citizen.

2362
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,880
I'm gonna get a diet freedom.

2363
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:33,880
I haven't put down my strategies yet.

2364
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:34,320
What am I doing?

2365
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,840
I would love a little sip of freedom.

2366
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,020
Do you have the Dr. Pepper?

2367
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,120
That's a very freedom, democratic drink.

2368
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,920
No, it's just diet freedom.

2369
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,260
It is?

2370
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:49,900
Can I get a Nuka-Cola?

2371
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,500
Real helldivers!

2372
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,180
Real helldivers!

2373
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:55,520
Go.

2374
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,820
Stop oogling.

2375
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,180
My man is stuck.

2376
01:19:59,480 --> 01:19:59,820
Never mind.

2377
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:03,740
My favorite thing is that they go on top of the rock just to get to where they are.

2378
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:09,060
How do you like the taste of freedom?

2379
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:10,520
Freedom!

2380
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:10,800
I'm not even doing anything.

2381
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,460
I hope you guys are...

2382
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,760
We're almost... keep printing, keep touching, keep doing.

2383
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,300
I'm waiting.

2384
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:17,780
I'm waiting.

2385
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,260
Almost there, almost there, almost there.

2386
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:20,900
Patience.

2387
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,500
It's a virtue I do not have.

2388
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:26,380
We know.

2389
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,120
Oh, my machine gun.

2390
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,120
Oh, wow.

2391
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,040
That's a lot of things.

2392
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:35,680
Oh, my God.

2393
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,680
I'm right in front of the door.

2394
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:37,000
Shit.

2395
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:39,040
Run!

2396
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:40,240
It's okay.

2397
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,120
Run, run, run, little man.

2398
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:41,680
Just run through.

2399
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:43,180
Run, little man, run!

2400
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,220
I'm printing more men.

2401
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:47,880
Printing more men.

2402
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,280
Come on.

2403
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:49,840
The mother of men.

2404
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:50,540
Printing men.

2405
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:51,280
Printing men.

2406
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:53,460
Run, my clones.

2407
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,140
The mother of men.

2408
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,440
Sons of the patriots.

2409
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,060
Genome soldiers.

2410
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,580
Three more people coming now.

2411
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:58,940
They really are your genomes.

2412
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:00,200
Run, my little genome soldiers.

2413
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:03,900
Oh, my God.

2414
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,860
Is that a Metal Gear reference?

2415
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,040
Oh, my God.

2416
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:09,160
I can't believe you just made a Metal Gear reference.

2417
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,500
That's crazy.

2418
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,360
I feel like I'm not doing enough.

2419
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,280
Yeah, you're doing great.

2420
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,680
You're doing the most important job of all.

2421
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:18,200
Now we get the fuck out of here.

2422
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,100
You're printing the little men.

2423
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:19,500
Yay!

2424
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:20,300
We did it!

2425
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:25,200
Have you done the...

2426
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,140
You can start this up over here, Mint.

2427
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:28,240
Which one?

2428
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:28,740
Where am I?

2429
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:29,800
Over here.

2430
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,700
I regret picking it.

2431
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,440
Do you see my little white arrow thingy?

2432
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,140
Come to it.

2433
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,040
It's time for you to input the Konami code.

2434
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,040
Oh, here.

2435
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,200
Interact.

2436
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:44,960
You got this.

2437
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,680
Got it.

2438
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,340
You're basically a soldier now.

2439
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,520
Oh, my God.

2440
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:56,060
You have now evolved to a super citizen.

2441
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,300
Super citizen?

2442
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,580
Does that mean I have to pay super taxes?

2443
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:02,080
Yeah, you do.

2444
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,540
Unfortunately, I cannot disclose this information.

2445
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:06,640
But good luck.

2446
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:08,560
Whoa, these are so awesome.

2447
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:09,540
These are like turrets.

2448
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,040
Yeah, it's my turret.

2449
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:13,760
Be careful, though.

2450
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,480
It can still kill you even though it's her turret.

2451
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:16,020
Oh, just kidding.

2452
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:17,140
I'll run away.

2453
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:17,820
Yup, be careful.

2454
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,000
Also, I'm sorry, girls.

2455
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:21,500
I can't mute.

2456
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:22,400
Thank you for the gifted.

2457
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:24,140
Yay!

2458
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:27,820
What's an anti-tank?

2459
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:29,140
I really appreciate it.

2460
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:30,100
Oh, wow.

2461
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,460
It's a turret that hates tanks.

2462
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:31,960
I'm joking.

2463
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:32,860
Yeah, it hates it.

2464
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,680
I think I just acquired it.

2465
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,440
Don't shoot us with it.

2466
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:39,420
Are you sure?

2467
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:40,760
I think you should shoot us with it.

2468
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,240
Are you sure?

2469
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,800
Do it.

2470
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:43,580
Do it.

2471
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,540
I'm sure.

2472
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,900
I had a shield.

2473
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,200
You sucker.

2474
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,360
I had a shield, Mint.

2475
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,140
I had a shield.

2476
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:57,820
My...

2477
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,860
You know what?

2478
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,520
I'm gonna drop my help pod right on your head.

2479
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:02,120
Where are you?

2480
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,360
I dropped on my dead body, actually.

2481
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,300
You can grab the shield if you want, Mint.

2482
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,100
No, no, no.

2483
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:10,300
It's okay.

2484
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,920
I should have given it to you sooner.

2485
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:13,540
No, no, no.

2486
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,280
Don't worry about it.

2487
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,080
I'll worry about it.

2488
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,240
Don't worry about it.

2489
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:18,720
Get it, Twisted.

2490
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,980
Okay, these chargers, you see them?

2491
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,600
The big guy with the big pouch on his butt.

2492
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,700
You gotta pop the little pouch on his butt.

2493
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,440
He charges on you.

2494
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:28,860
I don't see what you're talking about.

2495
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:30,920
He's at the bottom there.

2496
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:32,980
Penia's attacking him.

2497
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:34,920
I'm attacking something.

2498
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,880
It's a bug with a big thick butt.

2499
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,220
Got a big fat butt.

2500
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:42,800
Gotta hit his butt.

2501
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,920
I'm just shooting.

2502
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:48,180
Hit the butt!

2503
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:49,220
Oh, this guy!

2504
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:50,580
Yeah, you see?

2505
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:51,400
He's got a big butt.

2506
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,580
Once you blow up the little ball on his butt, he dies like three seconds after.

2507
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,540
Weak.

2508
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,000
Weak.

2509
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:01,540
Why would you die once you're...

2510
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:04,820
Oh, someone shot me and launched me into the fray.

2511
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:05,920
Wait, what?

2512
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,120
It wasn't me for real.

2513
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:09,580
Be careful.

2514
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:10,680
You might die.

2515
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,240
Yeah, um, I'm okay.

2516
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,480
Okay, guys, the ship is here if you want to go in.

2517
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,000
There we go.

2518
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:20,560
I'm trying to get up.

2519
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,340
My murder is girls.

2520
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:24,740
It's time.

2521
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,600
I can't believe I lived.

2522
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:28,120
How did I survive that?

2523
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,280
I don't know.

2524
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:30,980
Oh, whoops.

2525
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,520
I somehow got it.

2526
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,780
How did I live?

2527
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:39,560
You're just too good at the game.

2528
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,760
You're just a cracked gamer.

2529
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,120
You're a natural.

2530
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,280
I got blown up by the bugs and I flew to the bugs and then I...

2531
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,020
There was rain of spiders and everything.

2532
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:49,920
It's crazy.

2533
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,380
You fell into the ring of spiders?

2534
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,600
We survived.

2535
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,160
How you liking it so far?

2536
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:01,120
It's so fun.

2537
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:07,800
We, at one point, Haruka and I played this until like 8 in the morning.

2538
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:11,820
Because what happens is somebody will drop out and then another person will come in.

2539
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,840
The lobby changes every time and we just played until 8 in the morning.

2540
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,100
Outstanding patriotism.

2541
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:20,420
That's the title of my ship.

2542
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,480
It's the patriotism of patriotism.

2543
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:24,800
I like that.

2544
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,560
I think I'm the mother of battle.

2545
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:28,220
The mother of battle.

2546
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,380
My ship is called the Dawn of Eternity.

2547
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:31,260
Oooh.

2548
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:32,940
That's cute.

2549
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:35,520
You should be badass.

2550
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,520
That's cute.

2551
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:39,760
I swear to God, man.

2552
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,220
I'm happy you're back but fuck you.

2553
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,080
Yeah, frick you too.

2554
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,540
I can't believe this man SMH'd my head.

2555
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:55,340
Whoa.

2556
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:57,880
I'm green.

2557
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,940
No I'm not.

2558
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,240
I was looking at you.

2559
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,360
Wait, why are you guys all green?

2560
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,480
You would die.

2561
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:07,420
I haven't showered in two days.

2562
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:09,340
I'm clean.

2563
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,260
This is another stupid defend mission.

2564
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,300
I'm getting worse.

2565
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:16,360
You've always been worse.

2566
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:18,060
I'm getting worse though.

2567
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,080
Can I get much worse than how I already am?

2568
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:23,880
Get it twisted, Min.

2569
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,480
I'm twisted.

2570
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,580
My brain is twisted.

2571
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:27,800
She twisted.

2572
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:33,980
Every time I look at you it makes me want to have mint chocolate and I hate mint chocolate and this is all your fault.

2573
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:38,620
See, that's where it's like a brainwashing.

2574
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,560
Are you trying to brainwash me to like something that I hate?

2575
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:42,020
Yeah.

2576
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:43,840
Wait, you hate it?

2577
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,220
Yeah, I don't like mint chocolate.

2578
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,360
Bad taste.

2579
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:49,640
You never liked the chocolate mint?

2580
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:51,820
Never ever ever?

2581
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,000
It just feels too strong in my mouth.

2582
01:26:55,340 --> 01:27:01,200
I think when I was a kid I liked it but as I grew up I just enjoyed different tastes.

2583
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:02,860
I don't hate it I guess.

2584
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,380
That's my girl.

2585
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,740
I like peppermint but you know what?

2586
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,320
Maybe I should try mint chocolate now.

2587
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:10,880
Yeah.

2588
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,280
I tried them.

2589
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:13,340
What's it called?

2590
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:24,740
The ones that that have the dark chocolate and the white chocolate or not white chocolate the white mint inside.

2591
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:27,140
I think it's after 8.

2592
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,540
Oh, the peppermint patties.

2593
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,680
Oh, never mind.

2594
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:33,180
It's so good.

2595
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:34,320
They are?

2596
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:36,340
Peppermint patties?

2597
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,180
Yeah, they're so yummy.

2598
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,740
Isn't that girl scout ones?

2599
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,060
No.

2600
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,400
Oh, these things.

2601
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,260
I don't think I've ever had them.

2602
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:49,760
Those are mints.

2603
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:51,200
Gosh.

2604
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,540
Matara, those are mints.

2605
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,700
The girl scout ones.

2606
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:58,180
Oh, I'm ready.

2607
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:58,440
Sorry.

2608
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:58,600
No.

2609
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,780
I like mints.

2610
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,640
Maybe I should try these three one day.

2611
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,380
And I'll message you going, they are still shit mint.

2612
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:11,160
They're still really shit but I did it for you.

2613
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,760
They still suck.

2614
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,120
Yes, please report back to me.

2615
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:22,440
Every year you should set a date for April 23rd where you try them and then you message mint and go, still sucks.

2616
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:24,040
April 23rd?

2617
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:26,040
That's not...

2618
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:26,420
Wait.

2619
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,260
Oh, I was thinking of 33rd.

2620
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,760
I was like, there's no...

2621
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,720
There is no 23rd.

2622
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:37,520
What if I just make an entire documentary of me trying out mint chocolate just for you.

2623
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:39,120
Be like, hi guys.

2624
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:41,720
We're gonna get you...

2625
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:46,100
I'm gonna send you a bunch of mint chocolates and then you can just try them all and you can decide.

2626
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:46,400
Oh, wait.

2627
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:46,920
Mint.

2628
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:47,820
Grab the backpack.

2629
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:50,940
I'm actually so down to do this.

2630
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:51,860
I'll leave the backpack for you.

2631
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:52,860
Where?

2632
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:56,820
Give me all your favorite mint chocolates and that would be a fun collab to do actually.

2633
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,440
Holy shit.

2634
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,340
I'm so down to do this.

2635
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:00,460
Wait.

2636
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:05,760
Do they have a matcha flavor in the ice cream or is that only a Japan thing?

2637
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,220
We do a little bit.

2638
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:07,880
A little bit.

2639
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,080
But it's not as popular here.

2640
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:11,940
It's way more popular in Japan.

2641
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,140
And the matcha in Japan is so good.

2642
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,640
I never left my house.

2643
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,620
I don't know what that's like.

2644
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:21,620
Well, you and Henya are a little two hikikomoris.

2645
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,920
Yeah, we never go outside.

2646
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,160
Which is ironic considering my background.

2647
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:29,420
Yeah, outside is overrated, babe.

2648
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:30,300
Outside is scary.

2649
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,280
Don't go outside.

2650
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:33,040
What were you saying, Finn?

2651
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:33,600
What were you asking?

2652
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,700
I don't remember.

2653
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,400
Welcome to the team.

2654
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:43,600
Welcome to hell, my friend.

2655
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:44,780
Oh, they're gone.

2656
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:48,460
Oh, this is the one where you have to load the little Seath missiles.

2657
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,480
Alright, let's do this.

2658
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,440
Let's not throw a grenade for this one.

2659
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:54,620
Cause we'll get more points if we don't actually do it.

2660
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,100
What do you mean more points?

2661
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,600
We get more points for stars.

2662
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,000
Oh, that's a big one.

2663
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:00,020
Oh, that's his butt.

2664
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:00,840
That's his butt.

2665
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:01,220
Stars?

2666
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:02,740
Wait, how do I get your butt?

2667
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:04,120
Get your butt.

2668
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:04,680
Get your butt.

2669
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,820
That was where the thingy went in, no?

2670
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,260
No, I want to see your butt.

2671
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:12,920
Give me your butt.

2672
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:13,500
Give me your butt.

2673
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,640
There it is.

2674
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:14,840
Oh.

2675
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,400
She's staying suspiciously.

2676
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:18,000
Oh my god.

2677
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:18,680
Oh my god.

2678
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,740
I got killed

2679
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:28,870
by Henya.

2680
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:30,270
I think the game glitched again.

2681
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:32,330
I got killed by Henya again.

2682
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:35,210
Mata, can you revive all of us?

2683
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:35,550
All three?

2684
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:41,570
Alright, girls.

2685
01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:42,570
Make yourselves useful.

2686
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:46,950
Grab an artillery missile and load them in.

2687
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:47,510
I'm going back.

2688
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:49,350
You can't tell me what to do.

2689
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:51,790
I'm bringing back my stuff.

2690
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,170
Go get your stuff.

2691
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,010
You can see it on the map.

2692
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:58,630
It's just that I was the only one alive.

2693
01:30:58,630 --> 01:31:00,510
So I'm the only one that can summon you guys back.

2694
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:00,810
Yeah.

2695
01:31:02,110 --> 01:31:03,210
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

2696
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:05,530
Yeah, you can go get your stuff.

2697
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:06,970
You can see it on the map.

2698
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:07,690
You can follow them.

2699
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:11,010
These bugs are pissing me off, you sons of bitches.

2700
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:12,810
These bugs were made for walking.

2701
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:15,210
And that's just what they...

2702
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:15,330
Oh!

2703
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:15,830
Oh!

2704
01:31:15,890 --> 01:31:16,330
Oh!

2705
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:17,810
That's just what they do.

2706
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:19,670
The drop method is just how you...

2707
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:23,910
How is that actually faster?

2708
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:24,990
What the heck?

2709
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:26,090
Where is my stuff?

2710
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:28,930
Where is my stuff?

2711
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:29,610
Is that my stuff?

2712
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:31,570
Is that my stuff?

2713
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:34,630
This is like...

2714
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:36,710
This is speedrunner strat.

2715
01:31:38,110 --> 01:31:38,990
She's speedrunning?

2716
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:43,350
It's cause... I didn't know how to speedrun a mission, but that's cause I never do the missions.

2717
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:45,530
I always bring Haruka who always does the missions.

2718
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:51,630
Where do I put it?

2719
01:31:51,950 --> 01:31:52,730
Are you okay?

2720
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:53,870
You're okay!

2721
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:55,650
No!

2722
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:56,110
You're okay!

2723
01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:58,470
Watch this, Min.

2724
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:58,930
Watch this.

2725
01:31:59,130 --> 01:31:59,570
Uh-huh.

2726
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,510
Dead.

2727
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:04,690
Is this the bug guy?

2728
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:05,450
Or am I crazy?

2729
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:06,590
Yeah, that's bug guy.

2730
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:08,550
But if you have...

2731
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:09,250
Charger!

2732
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:09,730
Charger!

2733
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:12,010
So your weapon...

2734
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:13,990
If you shoot at it...

2735
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:15,810
Do you see these sparks coming out of it?

2736
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:18,750
That means your IMO is not penetrating.

2737
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:19,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2738
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:21,170
I noticed that.

2739
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:23,690
So you have to hit his ass.

2740
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:24,890
But for me, who has...

2741
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:26,530
What I like to call the croissant cannon.

2742
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:31,130
If I shoot his face at the right angle, I can one-shot him and kill him instantly.

2743
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:31,730
Croissant!

2744
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:33,230
Croissant!

2745
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:36,730
It's called the croissart cannon, but I call it the croissant cannon.

2746
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:38,250
Oh, my stuff is over here.

2747
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:40,450
Oh, my stuff is over there.

2748
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:41,570
You know what?

2749
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:42,390
Let's just leave it alone.

2750
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:44,350
No, go get your stuff!

2751
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:45,210
Go get your shield pack.

2752
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:47,190
There's a lot of guys over there.

2753
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:48,310
They'll help you.

2754
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:49,150
You got your friend.

2755
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:50,950
No, they're dead.

2756
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:52,850
All the guys are dead.

2757
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:54,550
It's a woman's only game.

2758
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:55,930
No men here.

2759
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:58,850
I actually don't even know where my stuff is.

2760
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:00,430
Oh, right here.

2761
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:00,910
You're right.

2762
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:02,030
Thanks!

2763
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:06,390
My shield is back!

2764
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:09,010
Now you won't die!

2765
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:10,730
I'm coming back!

2766
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:12,710
I died before though.

2767
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:14,550
It's kind of crazy how that works.

2768
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:18,050
So Henya's eagle also broke the illegal...

2769
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:20,490
transmitter tower thingy.

2770
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:21,030
Which is funny.

2771
01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:25,190
But if you actually do it legitimately, you get more points.

2772
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:27,210
So I was gonna see if that was the case.

2773
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:29,290
Oh, so Henya did it illegitimately.

2774
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:30,850
Yeah, but it's okay.

2775
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:32,490
I didn't realize I was so far on the map.

2776
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:34,450
Wait, did I fuck up?

2777
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:35,910
No!

2778
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:39,390
We just get less points, but that's it.

2779
01:33:40,230 --> 01:33:41,190
We just get less points, but that's it.

2780
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:41,650
Oh, ow!

2781
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:43,710
Nice, I got rid of the nest.

2782
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,350
Good job, girlies.

2783
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:47,850
The bug nest, by the way, you'll see them in the future.

2784
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:49,490
You gotta throw little grenades in them.

2785
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:54,470
It's a tutorial, but they look different, so I don't know what they look like in the real world.

2786
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:55,790
Yeah, because I keep killing them before.

2787
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:59,030
I only know them in the mission.

2788
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:00,510
The tutorial.

2789
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:02,870
They haven't trained me for the real world.

2790
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:06,350
I'll stop giving help from now on.

2791
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,850
If you have questions, feel free to ask.

2792
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:14,070
It's just that at first, when I first played, nobody explained anything to me and I had a really hard time streaming and following along.

2793
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:15,470
No, you're good.

2794
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,350
Did I do a bad job explaining to you?

2795
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:19,110
My first game wasn't with you, baby.

2796
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:23,670
And again, it's absolutely not, you know, a criticism.

2797
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:26,210
I played with some lovely people who were great.

2798
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:27,750
Yes?

2799
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:29,930
Oh, you need some help?

2800
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:31,290
I got you, baby girl.

2801
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:31,750
Run.

2802
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:33,190
I'm trying to run.

2803
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:34,450
Oh, I'm running.

2804
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:35,810
It sounds like a song.

2805
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:37,130
I'm trying to run.

2806
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:38,550
I'm trying to run.

2807
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:40,550
I'm trying to run.

2808
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:41,410
I'm trying to run.

2809
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:44,590
I'm trying to run.

2810
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:48,450
Oh, I need to reload.

2811
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:52,350
I need to reload.

2812
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:53,570
I need to reload.

2813
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:54,910
I need to run.

2814
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:57,010
I need to run.

2815
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:58,970
It's crazy, this beam.

2816
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:00,270
I know.

2817
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:01,670
You get it at level 20.

2818
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:03,810
I was so happy when I finally got mine.

2819
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:06,830
It's like a badge of honor.

2820
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:08,090
It is.

2821
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:11,290
It does take a little while, even if you play the game a lot.

2822
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,440
I'd say still tell her about holding R.

2823
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:26,440
Oh, yeah, if you are zoomed in on your gun, and you press middle button, it gives you like the extra scope, which I didn't find out until like two weeks ago.

2824
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:26,960
Wait, what?

2825
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:27,820
I didn't know about it.

2826
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,060
I didn't find out until two weeks ago.

2827
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,440
I didn't know about it.

2828
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,420
Wait, how do you shoot with what?

2829
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,740
Let's say you're shooting your gun, right?

2830
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,540
You're aiming with right mouse and then click middle mouse.

2831
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:39,960
Isn't that crazy?

2832
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,400
You can do that with every gun.

2833
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:43,640
Oh, my God.

2834
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,680
I didn't know that.

2835
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,800
Also, another one.

2836
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,380
Hold R, you can change the speed.

2837
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:51,540
What?

2838
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:53,120
What?

2839
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,220
Hold R.

2840
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:57,000
On your gun.

2841
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,420
And then what?

2842
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:05,140
I believe, I can't exactly remember how to switch between the two, but like for my sickle, I'm shooting 100 M per minute.

2843
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,800
100 bullets per minute.

2844
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:09,920
Is that the fastest?

2845
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:11,920
Because I only want to shoot faster, not slower.

2846
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:13,280
Yeah.

2847
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:15,400
The higher the number, the faster it is.

2848
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,780
And how do you get the number up?

2849
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:20,440
It depends if it's sideways.

2850
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:21,760
I think you use your scroll wheel.

2851
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:25,220
Oh, it's the sideways that means it's going to go faster.

2852
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:26,760
I don't know which way I like more.

2853
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,640
I'm trying to remember the patrols.

2854
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,740
No, it's fine.

2855
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:32,520
Don't worry about it.

2856
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:33,780
Explosive barrel.

2857
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:35,560
I got you, queen.

2858
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,060
Oh.

2859
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:40,100
Oh, there are guys over there.

2860
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,140
Oh, there are guys over there.

2861
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:43,000
Oh, there are guys over there.

2862
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:47,960
Oh, there are guys over there.

2863
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:49,780
What's this?

2864
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:51,760
Note.

2865
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:52,600
Oh.

2866
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:54,920
Good job.

2867
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:56,720
Wait.

2868
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,780
I have like no bullets at all.

2869
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:00,280
Uh-oh.

2870
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,620
Wait, I can do a resupply.

2871
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:05,860
Yeah, resupply.

2872
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:07,020
You can resupply?

2873
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:07,320
Yeah.

2874
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:11,640
And then if you see these...

2875
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:13,040
Wait, wait, don't open it, H4.

2876
01:37:13,780 --> 01:37:17,940
Once Mick gets here, I want her to see this and open it so that she sees what it looks like.

2877
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:18,880
Okay.

2878
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,000
May I take the stim?

2879
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,540
Yeah, you can take the stim.

2880
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:23,680
Thank you.

2881
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,340
Is it the friendship door?

2882
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,440
No, I want her to see what it's like when you...

2883
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,440
when there's the little glowy stuff on the map.

2884
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:35,860
So, Mint, come towards me.

2885
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,080
Do you see... come here.

2886
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,920
Do you see this big glowy thing where I'm here?

2887
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:39,780
Where are you?

2888
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,800
This can sometimes have extra guns or it can have like super credits.

2889
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:46,860
Whoa!

2890
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:50,460
What is that?

2891
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:51,100
Reposition clips.

2892
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:53,720
That's the stuff that you need to level up.

2893
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:58,360
If you see a shiny spot, it's like a little treasure.

2894
01:37:58,520 --> 01:37:58,780
Yeah.

2895
01:37:58,780 --> 01:37:59,400
Always try to pick it up.

2896
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:02,360
Charger!

2897
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,280
A charger?

2898
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:06,600
Wait, is that a charger?

2899
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,380
Left 4 Dead.

2900
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:10,280
Charger!

2901
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:12,280
Left 4 Dead 2.

2902
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,980
I want to play that game again.

2903
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:14,340
Yeah!

2904
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,040
What about Harvest Plate one day?

2905
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:18,280
Well, yeah!

2906
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:22,990
I don't think I've...

2907
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:24,790
I played it, I think, only once.

2908
01:38:24,910 --> 01:38:25,890
Like a year ago.

2909
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:29,810
Wait, am I okay?

2910
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:30,970
Oh, no, I'm not okay.

2911
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:32,690
I would avoid his...

2912
01:38:33,370 --> 01:38:34,250
His everything?

2913
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:37,910
Yeah, you can like press off to get out of his attack.

2914
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:41,050
Oh, I definitely did.

2915
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:41,870
Yeah, I did that.

2916
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:42,830
Oh, nice.

2917
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:47,830
The shield also will absorb, I think, like one damage from him.

2918
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:48,990
But I'm not sure if it's like a full.

2919
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,650
I shot you with the shield.

2920
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:55,750
I got him.

2921
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:56,910
Good job!

2922
01:38:57,850 --> 01:38:58,190
Nice!

2923
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:05,880
We have for some guns, if you hold R, you can change the speed a bit.

2924
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:06,560
And I can't...

2925
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,400
Oh, here we go.

2926
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,080
That's crazy.

2927
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:12,680
So if the bar is up on the gun, you scroll your wheel up to change it.

2928
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,180
What the hell is this?

2929
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:17,100
So now I'm used to seeing like one little bug nest.

2930
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:19,160
Oh, wait, there's a bug nest.

2931
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,160
Oh, yeah, Mint, Mint, Mint, I'll let you come.

2932
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,340
Mint, you have to shoot your grenade inside the hole.

2933
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:23,840
Okay.

2934
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:24,460
Your grenade.

2935
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:24,940
Come here.

2936
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:25,640
Stand here.

2937
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,240
But like you have to shoot it in...

2938
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:29,660
Good job!

2939
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,600
I did shoot it in!

2940
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:35,300
I'm using the grenades that explode immediately.

2941
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:39,000
So I forget that like regular grenades take a while to pop up.

2942
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:41,100
Sorry.

2943
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,620
No, you're okay.

2944
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:43,960
No, you're okay.

2945
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,100
Mine pops like right away.

2946
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:47,640
This is great.

2947
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:50,120
Oh my God, he was so cute right in my face.

2948
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,160
I can do that, by the way.

2949
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:54,360
I have the same flaws.

2950
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:59,120
Here, now that I'm not being chased by 40,000 dogs, I can teach you what I was trying to teach you, Matta.

2951
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:00,240
Sorry?

2952
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,020
I can teach you what I was trying to teach you without being chased.

2953
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,880
So stop moving and then hold R.

2954
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,020
Yeah, yeah, no, I saw what it looks like.

2955
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:07,360
Thank you.

2956
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:07,580
Thank you.

2957
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,500
It's like you hold R and then it like switches.

2958
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,940
You just move your scroll wheel up to change your speed.

2959
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:14,220
Wait, uh-oh.

2960
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,040
I'm changing things and I don't know what I'm doing.

2961
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,880
So 100 means faster, right?

2962
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:18,480
Yes.

2963
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,240
And you move your scroll wheel just up to change the speed.

2964
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:23,600
So right now you see how...

2965
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,980
Oh, I see, I see it.

2966
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,860
So my default is I was just shooting slow?

2967
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,880
No, 100 is the fastest.

2968
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,240
People are saying that's range.

2969
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,200
Oh, that's the scope of the gun?

2970
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,580
Oh, it depends on some guns.

2971
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:39,520
Oh, right click.

2972
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,920
My chap said right click is speed.

2973
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:44,400
Oh, I have a...

2974
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,560
Oh, there's a flashlight.

2975
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:46,520
Oh.

2976
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:49,580
That's the scope.

2977
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:51,900
Okay, so every gun is a little different apparently.

2978
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:52,560
Okay.

2979
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,480
Mom, what are you doing?

2980
01:40:54,480 --> 01:41:01,060
I genuinely didn't know.

2981
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,540
What the heck?

2982
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:05,120
I genuinely didn't know.

2983
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,200
I've never...

2984
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,560
I genuinely had no idea.

2985
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:10,880
I'm so sorry.

2986
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:13,900
Oh my god.

2987
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:16,480
I'm gonna request reinforcement.

2988
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,540
I'm gonna request reinforcement.

2989
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:21,100
I'm so sorry everything go down.

2990
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:23,900
I'm so sorry.

2991
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,640
So for some guns, holding R changes the scope.

2992
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:29,480
And some guns, like the machine gun, changes the speed of how you shoot.

2993
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:32,540
And some guns, like the machine gun, changes the speed of how you shoot.

2994
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:34,000
Democracy is landing.

2995
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,420
Wait, where's our stuff?

2996
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:39,480
You can see it on the map.

2997
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:42,060
That was so fucking funny though.

2998
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,220
I'm so sorry.

2999
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,480
The backpack is there if you want it, yeah.

3000
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:45,940
That's true.

3001
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:46,800
Some guns are different.

3002
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:49,080
Just holding R changes your settings.

3003
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:50,040
This is yours.

3004
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:50,580
This is yours.

3005
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:50,860
Yeah?

3006
01:41:52,660 --> 01:41:53,880
I'm going the wrong way.

3007
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:56,400
Helldiver.

3008
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,520
I have one right here too.

3009
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,280
Your machine gun.

3010
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,560
Oh, my machine gun.

3011
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:00,840
Thank you.

3012
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:03,440
You guys are so cute.

3013
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:04,300
Kawaii.

3014
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:05,520
No, you.

3015
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,620
Tomodachi Kawaii.

3016
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:09,620
I'm your friend.

3017
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,700
Oh, no, no, big guy.

3018
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:15,780
I guess it would be like Oshidachi or Tomooshi.

3019
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:16,960
Tomoshi.

3020
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:18,460
Tomodachi.

3021
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:19,820
Tomodachi.

3022
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:22,940
We're taking your combat zone.

3023
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:24,620
Wait, wait.

3024
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,180
We're taking your combat zone.

3025
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,560
Oh, no.

3026
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:28,620
Are you a traitor?

3027
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:29,780
Wait, I'm a traitor.

3028
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:30,560
Are you a filthy traitor?

3029
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,280
Wait, wait.

3030
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,460
Don't get out of the combat zone.

3031
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,500
How do I get back to the...

3032
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,280
How do I get back to the combat zone?

3033
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:39,440
You have to run back to the combat zone.

3034
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:40,740
That's the way.

3035
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,780
I'm not a traitor.

3036
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:45,040
I'm not a traitor.

3037
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:47,020
I'm not a traitor.

3038
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:47,980
I'm not a traitor.

3039
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,400
I cannot believe...

3040
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,780
I think the game glitched again.

3041
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:53,400
I said I was killed by Hanya.

3042
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,180
Wait, what?

3043
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:57,420
I didn't tell you.

3044
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,420
We didn't glitch it.

3045
01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:02,360
I think the game is glitched.

3046
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:04,540
We didn't glitch.

3047
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,260
You're hoping.

3048
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,320
Wait, I didn't kill her this time.

3049
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:11,100
I didn't kill her this time.

3050
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,800
Hanya, you're a murderer.

3051
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:16,000
Hanya is a tiny little baby murderer.

3052
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:17,020
Hanya is a tiny little baby murderer.

3053
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:19,760
I was going to do the shark song, but you're on the YouTube.

3054
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:21,980
So we're going to be careful not to say that.

3055
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:23,100
What song?

3056
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,940
I was going to say baby murderer.

3057
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:27,360
I think it's okay.

3058
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:29,800
It's going to be like...

3059
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:31,480
Oh, that definitely can't be the original.

3060
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:33,380
Sounds like an old hag singing it.

3061
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:34,180
He looks a little different.

3062
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,340
Also, so this isn't just an ignorant question, my friend.

3063
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:42,140
So you can't like do a little humming of songs or a little singing of songs on YouTube.

3064
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:43,000
Wait, not even the humming?

3065
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:44,340
No, you can, I think.

3066
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,420
I think it's...

3067
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:45,680
Oh, okay.

3068
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:48,140
Is it weird that the Charger looks different than before?

3069
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:51,100
It does look a little different.

3070
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:51,980
He does, I think.

3071
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:53,180
You never played it before!

3072
01:43:53,740 --> 01:43:54,300
This guy?

3073
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,240
Oh, is he not the Buttman?

3074
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:59,040
Yeah, he's the Buttman, but he looks a little different.

3075
01:43:59,100 --> 01:43:59,980
He looks more armored.

3076
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:01,020
He also is taking a...

3077
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:02,060
Oh, it is a different variant.

3078
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:03,660
He's taking a ton of them.

3079
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,660
Yeah, it's like a boss.

3080
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:05,720
He's a boss.

3081
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:06,680
He's not...

3082
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,640
He's not a Buttman, he's a boss man.

3083
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,700
He's a boss man.

3084
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,380
Mr. Buttman!

3085
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:12,140
Gun dancer!

3086
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,220
Bring me a dream!

3087
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:14,780
Buttman!

3088
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:20,200
He's still alive!

3089
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:22,560
Die already!

3090
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,500
How is he alive without his butt?

3091
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:25,480
Die already!

3092
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,000
I've never seen him before.

3093
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,000
Stop camping!

3094
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:29,320
He's obsessed with me!

3095
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:31,060
I know why, but I can't...

3096
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:31,680
He's alive!

3097
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,480
He's still crawling, what the heck?

3098
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:35,320
I've never seen one last so long.

3099
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:40,850
Oh, he's dead.

3100
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:41,710
Nice!

3101
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:43,050
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

3102
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:45,650
Guys, I have a bad feeling.

3103
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:46,810
Yup, we're gonna get bugged.

3104
01:44:46,950 --> 01:44:47,310
Sorry.

3105
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:48,210
We're gonna get bugged?

3106
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:48,830
I let them call it.

3107
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:51,130
I let them call it.

3108
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:51,450
My bad.

3109
01:44:52,770 --> 01:44:54,450
Watch out, I'm gonna throw an eagle at it.

3110
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:56,090
I already threw one.

3111
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:59,590
I'm gonna go all the way over here, Dayo.

3112
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:02,290
All the way over here?

3113
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:02,910
Oh!

3114
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:03,830
Uh-huh.

3115
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:04,810
Or I just pinged.

3116
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:05,230
Oh.

3117
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:05,970
Okay.

3118
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:06,790
Oh, nice.

3119
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:07,250
Uh-huh.

3120
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:09,070
Because this looks like an escort citizen's mission.

3121
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:09,510
Okay.

3122
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:10,770
I need to go get the...

3123
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:11,410
I'm going to, I'm going to.

3124
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:12,830
Which planet is this?

3125
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:13,930
This is the defense planet.

3126
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:15,310
The one that we have in the mission.

3127
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:15,710
I am coming.

3128
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:17,670
I'm coming too.

3129
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:19,890
Help.

3130
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:20,450
Help.

3131
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:21,570
Help.

3132
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:23,170
Help.

3133
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:24,030
Help.

3134
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:24,610
Help.

3135
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:28,130
Help.

3136
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:29,710
Help.

3137
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:32,610
It's okay.

3138
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:33,230
I had my shield.

3139
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:36,170
Yeah, the robot, the little robot doesn't discriminate.

3140
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:39,310
The little robot does not discriminate.

3141
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:40,550
It's true.

3142
01:45:40,630 --> 01:45:41,310
He kills anybody.

3143
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:42,750
I'm running.

3144
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:44,610
Nice use of the little eagles.

3145
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:45,850
Was that you, Mint?

3146
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:45,930
Thank you.

3147
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:48,250
No, I don't, I don't have eagles.

3148
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:50,350
Oh, you haven't unlocked them yet.

3149
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,030
I'll show you where to unlock them after this game.

3150
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:53,110
Can you guys remind me?

3151
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:54,210
Yep.

3152
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:55,790
What?

3153
01:45:55,930 --> 01:45:58,910
Hey, Ma, make sure you tell Mint about the eagles stratagems.

3154
01:45:59,150 --> 01:45:59,550
Oh.

3155
01:45:59,570 --> 01:45:59,690
Oh.

3156
01:45:59,690 --> 01:46:00,350
Oh, yeah, I will.

3157
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:02,350
Yeah, don't forget about it, though.

3158
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:03,910
Actually, Haruka, you can tell her about them.

3159
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:04,350
Don't forget about it.

3160
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:06,810
Because you can probably teach her how to aim better than I can aim.

3161
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:07,970
Yeah, I'll help you.

3162
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:09,110
I'll be with you.

3163
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:10,270
I'll be your buddy, Matara.

3164
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:10,870
No.

3165
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:13,150
I just kind of say, fuck it, we ball and hope for the best sometimes.

3166
01:46:13,330 --> 01:46:13,730
Yeah, come.

3167
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:15,250
I'm here.

3168
01:46:16,310 --> 01:46:17,690
Haruka, we're in polite society.

3169
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:20,110
Mint is a polite little one.

3170
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:20,310
This is...

3171
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:20,730
She's on YouTube.

3172
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:22,510
We can't be swearing like this.

3173
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:23,010
Oh.

3174
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:24,210
What?

3175
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:24,770
Haruka.

3176
01:46:24,990 --> 01:46:27,690
I'm part of a freedom society, actually.

3177
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:29,570
Um, a manager.

3178
01:46:29,610 --> 01:46:29,670
Oh.

3179
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:30,610
I'm part of a rich democratic society.

3180
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:31,030
Can I say fuck, then?

3181
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:32,650
Can I say fuck, Mint?

3182
01:46:32,910 --> 01:46:34,530
If anything, you're unmanaged.

3183
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:38,250
Wait, Mint, so does that mean I can say fuck now?

3184
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:39,610
Oh, goddamn.

3185
01:46:40,090 --> 01:46:40,410
Yay!

3186
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:41,610
She's going in.

3187
01:46:41,690 --> 01:46:42,390
She's going in.

3188
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:44,110
She's going in.

3189
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:45,410
Thank you, Mint.

3190
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:46,930
I can say fuck now.

3191
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:47,950
No, don't say thanks to Mint.

3192
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:49,790
Say thanks to Neil.

3193
01:46:50,510 --> 01:46:50,910
Huh?

3194
01:46:51,130 --> 01:46:51,690
Thank you.

3195
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:54,870
Always make sure to resupply, since you have a gun with bullets.

3196
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:55,190
Yeah.

3197
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:56,470
If you ever see bullets on the ground.

3198
01:46:56,690 --> 01:46:57,710
Have a gun with bullets.

3199
01:46:58,290 --> 01:46:59,350
Well, it's because mine...

3200
01:46:59,350 --> 01:46:59,650
Mine has bullets.

3201
01:46:59,650 --> 01:47:00,710
Mine all don't have bullets.

3202
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,190
Look at you, fancy pants.

3203
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:03,950
That's why.

3204
01:47:03,950 --> 01:47:04,390
I know.

3205
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:05,690
I did it because...

3206
01:47:05,690 --> 01:47:06,590
Okay, see the one...

3207
01:47:06,590 --> 01:47:08,310
One of them is, like, spitting something.

3208
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:09,550
He's, like, farting into the...

3209
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:10,050
Oh, too late.

3210
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:11,190
I didn't see.

3211
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:11,510
It's all right.

3212
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:12,410
It's all right.

3213
01:47:12,410 --> 01:47:12,970
We fart together.

3214
01:47:13,330 --> 01:47:13,350
I don't have to specialize.

3215
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:15,690
Realize.

3216
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:16,650
Realize.

3217
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:19,130
She believes.

3218
01:47:20,290 --> 01:47:20,830
My calories.

3219
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:22,730
She lies.

3220
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:22,850
Oh, no.

3221
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:24,110
I hate the butt man.

3222
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:24,330
It's okay.

3223
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:24,890
I got him.

3224
01:47:24,910 --> 01:47:25,110
I got him.

3225
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:25,310
I got him.

3226
01:47:25,310 --> 01:47:25,690
Um...

3227
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:27,590
Oh, and they're always obsessed with me.

3228
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:28,890
Oh, my God.

3229
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:29,630
It's because you're smart.

3230
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:30,750
You smell so minty.

3231
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:31,470
So cute.

3232
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:33,110
Let me kill the little bugs and they'll come help you.

3233
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:35,190
This always happens at picnics.

3234
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:36,850
The bugs come after me most.

3235
01:47:36,970 --> 01:47:37,390
Really?

3236
01:47:37,690 --> 01:47:38,670
Oh, you're gonna hate me.

3237
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:39,630
They never come after me.

3238
01:47:41,230 --> 01:47:42,150
Oh, hello.

3239
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:43,270
I...

3240
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:44,750
The little guys are so annoying.

3241
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:46,470
Like, they think they're a big deal, but they...

3242
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:46,690
Yeah.

3243
01:47:46,690 --> 01:47:47,210
They just suck.

3244
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:48,310
They're like two walls.

3245
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:50,530
Little bugs in big numbers.

3246
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:53,310
Little bugs, big adventures.

3247
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:54,910
Hell, hell, hell divers.

3248
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:57,910
Hell divers.

3249
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:58,770
Who?

3250
01:47:58,930 --> 01:47:59,170
Who?

3251
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:00,270
Who are you gonna call?

3252
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:01,470
Help.

3253
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:01,590
Help.

3254
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:02,170
Divers.

3255
01:48:02,490 --> 01:48:03,370
My mom.

3256
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:04,470
Beedity-bee-dee.

3257
01:48:04,690 --> 01:48:07,090
Your butt's real good.

3258
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:08,030
Wait.

3259
01:48:08,070 --> 01:48:09,070
You have no hair.

3260
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:13,370
Bustin'.

3261
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:13,950
Bustin'.

3262
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:14,490
Bustin'.

3263
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:14,910
Bustin'.

3264
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:15,430
Bustin'.

3265
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:15,870
Bustin.

3266
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:16,370
Bustin.

3267
01:48:16,370 --> 01:48:16,650
Bustin.

3268
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:17,050
Bustin.

3269
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:30,170
Bustin.

3270
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:37,670
You always feel like you run out of bullets until you kind of start learning where to look for bullets and grenades.

3271
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,370
Nades here.

3272
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:41,970
Nades here.

3273
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:42,910
Hold on.

3274
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:46,690
This is SSD drive.

3275
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:47,270
I'll give you a shield.

3276
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:49,290
Oh, thanks.

3277
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:50,470
I'm sorry.

3278
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:51,990
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

3279
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:55,790
Can Mint get 20 gifted too?

3280
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:57,110
I can't be the one winning.

3281
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:59,410
How about 21 gifted?

3282
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:02,450
Can anybody has 21 gifted for Mint going once?

3283
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:03,590
Wait, I forgot!

3284
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:05,610
YouTube's doing the gifted thing now!

3285
01:49:05,870 --> 01:49:06,170
Yeah!

3286
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:08,570
Yeah, it's been for a while.

3287
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:10,610
I remember when YouTube didn't do that.

3288
01:49:10,990 --> 01:49:12,210
Okay, she's an original.

3289
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:14,410
Thank you so much for the 20.

3290
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:15,830
Pepperidge Farm remembers.

3291
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:17,870
Pepperidge Farm remembers.

3292
01:49:18,490 --> 01:49:21,810
Oh, put that SSD into the thingy, hadn't ya?

3293
01:49:22,730 --> 01:49:23,810
They're doing the main quest, yeah.

3294
01:49:23,950 --> 01:49:24,430
Into this one?

3295
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:24,690
Into the hole.

3296
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:28,770
I'm just following you.

3297
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:30,550
I see you have full grenades.

3298
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:31,770
If not, pick up these grenades.

3299
01:49:31,910 --> 01:49:34,030
No, I'm full on grenades.

3300
01:49:34,630 --> 01:49:36,210
And then these are samples, by the way.

3301
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:36,790
You see here?

3302
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:38,770
Oh, we also gotta kill him.

3303
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:41,210
Pick it up.

3304
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:41,710
You pick it up.

3305
01:49:44,270 --> 01:49:45,730
There's usually more than one.

3306
01:49:45,810 --> 01:49:47,450
There's usually like two or three samples.

3307
01:49:47,670 --> 01:49:48,990
Couple samples, okay.

3308
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:51,470
But I think here there was only one.

3309
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:54,390
Henya is busting good.

3310
01:49:54,870 --> 01:49:55,510
She's busted.

3311
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:57,830
Busting, busting.

3312
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:05,070
Sometimes, you know, she'll come here and say stuff and I'm like, ah, gotta let her live her best life.

3313
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:06,570
I love that one.

3314
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:08,490
I'm happy.

3315
01:50:08,610 --> 01:50:08,790
Yay!

3316
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:13,550
Oh my gosh, thank you for the gifts and you guys, thank you.

3317
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:15,850
The Game Master does not like how fast we're progressing.

3318
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:18,910
22 gifted subs going once?

3319
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:20,430
We're fine, we're fine.

3320
01:50:21,290 --> 01:50:23,170
22 gifted subs going twice.

3321
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:23,530
We're fine.

3322
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:25,530
I hate this.

3323
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:28,790
I hate this.

3324
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:32,750
Yeah, and then this final mission is like right near where we're extracting.

3325
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:34,050
But no.

3326
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:35,750
Let's see what's up here.

3327
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:38,710
Up here?

3328
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:40,590
I'm following you, sorry.

3329
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:44,170
Yay, I'm always trying to like double check around because I'm always looking for samples and stuff.

3330
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:46,830
There's an extra gun here too if you have.

3331
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:48,810
Another gun?

3332
01:50:49,330 --> 01:50:50,050
There we go.

3333
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:51,610
But you already have a machine gun, I think.

3334
01:50:51,650 --> 01:50:52,170
Yeah, I do.

3335
01:50:54,150 --> 01:50:57,210
When you summon things, dude, doesn't it cost money?

3336
01:50:58,510 --> 01:50:59,310
Summon what things?

3337
01:50:59,470 --> 01:50:59,750
What do you mean?

3338
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:02,610
Like if I have to summon ammo and stuff, does it cost money?

3339
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:02,890
Nope.

3340
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:03,650
No, no, no, no, no.

3341
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:08,130
It's just that we all share a pool of some- so you have like- you see the stratagems that I used there, the eagles?

3342
01:51:08,650 --> 01:51:10,070
That'll have a limited amount of those.

3343
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:12,410
So then the resupplies, they go on cooldown.

3344
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:13,350
Same for your gun.

3345
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:15,390
Like your gun is free, but it has a cooldown.

3346
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:18,430
You can only summon it like three or four times in a game.

3347
01:51:19,090 --> 01:51:22,550
Which is why when you die, it's nice to go back to your old gun and pick it up.

3348
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:23,030
Yeah.

3349
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:25,450
Okay, that makes sense.

3350
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:26,890
Is that like 300 gifted?

3351
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:28,150
Why not 400, huh?

3352
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:29,450
We gotta go back.

3353
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:32,370
Evacuate the winter citizen people.

3354
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:33,650
Go back where?

3355
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:36,770
I could stay here and do the bug nest and then activate the...

3356
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:40,310
I'll stay.

3357
01:51:41,590 --> 01:51:42,190
You know what?

3358
01:51:42,210 --> 01:51:42,610
You go.

3359
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:44,970
I'll go by myself!

3360
01:51:45,930 --> 01:51:47,090
Yeah, I'm going too!

3361
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:48,450
I'll stay.

3362
01:51:48,450 --> 01:51:48,990
I'll stay.

3363
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:51,850
I was gonna go, but if we're... You can do whatever.

3364
01:51:52,230 --> 01:51:52,910
You can do whatever.

3365
01:51:53,110 --> 01:51:55,310
I just want to clear the little bug nest so we get more experience.

3366
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:55,490
Yeah!

3367
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:56,490
At least Hanya's coming with me.

3368
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:57,630
Okay, then I'll come with you.

3369
01:51:57,850 --> 01:51:58,510
I'm coming!

3370
01:51:59,210 --> 01:51:59,770
We're coming!

3371
01:52:00,310 --> 01:52:01,830
I'm gonna... I'm a little slow.

3372
01:52:02,450 --> 01:52:03,330
But I'm alright.

3373
01:52:03,330 --> 01:52:04,070
Oh, you're coming with us, Nick?

3374
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:04,530
Yeah.

3375
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:06,150
Okay, I'll wait.

3376
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:06,670
I'll get you.

3377
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:07,950
No, no, no, you don't have to wait.

3378
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:08,810
I'm waiting.

3379
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:10,690
We're waiting.

3380
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:11,170
Oh no!

3381
01:52:11,490 --> 01:52:11,590
Wait!

3382
01:52:11,610 --> 01:52:12,190
Shoot him!

3383
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:12,670
No!

3384
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:15,150
Oh my god, I activated a bug breach.

3385
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:20,010
We're getting comfortable here.

3386
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:20,850
Hey, Mint!

3387
01:52:21,110 --> 01:52:21,670
Oh, wow!

3388
01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:22,090
Hello!

3389
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:24,270
We've been waiting for you.

3390
01:52:24,570 --> 01:52:25,870
Sorry, it took so long.

3391
01:52:26,110 --> 01:52:26,870
Kept you waiting.

3392
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:28,510
Kept you waiting.

3393
01:52:28,690 --> 01:52:29,010
Hold on.

3394
01:52:29,010 --> 01:52:29,470
There we go.

3395
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:30,830
Oh, oh!

3396
01:52:31,090 --> 01:52:32,690
It's a dog pile now!

3397
01:52:32,910 --> 01:52:34,830
Well, we haven't seen each other for three years.

3398
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:37,590
We're gonna go up to close all the same.

3399
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:42,010
Well, what's a better way to get back to knowing each other than, you know...

3400
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:43,970
Collaborating!

3401
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:44,550
Democracy!

3402
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:45,190
Yay!

3403
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:45,610
Democracy!

3404
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:47,430
Great liberty!

3405
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:49,730
I love liberty.

3406
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:50,810
Sweet liberty!

3407
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:52,450
Sweet liberty!

3408
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:58,970
Alright, I'm gonna give myself a resupply so I can fill up my pack pack.

3409
01:53:01,270 --> 01:53:02,370
I'm gonna climb this rock.

3410
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:05,310
Maybe you shouldn't climb up that rock.

3411
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:06,670
You're really close to that pen.

3412
01:53:06,710 --> 01:53:08,770
I feel like you might accidentally kill yourself.

3413
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:10,590
I gotta run!

3414
01:53:11,170 --> 01:53:11,750
I'm okay!

3415
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:12,270
Now watch this.

3416
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:12,810
Boop, boop, boop.

3417
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:14,650
Boop, boop, boop.

3418
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:15,250
Nice!

3419
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:16,090
Nice!

3420
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:17,150
Oh, come here!

3421
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:17,370
Come here!

3422
01:53:17,370 --> 01:53:17,490
Come here!

3423
01:53:19,110 --> 01:53:19,850
Here you go.

3424
01:53:20,230 --> 01:53:21,430
Oh, thank you, Haru!

3425
01:53:22,050 --> 01:53:22,570
There you go.

3426
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:23,690
Now everyone is beat up!

3427
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:23,790
Thank you, thank you!

3428
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:27,930
Ready to go!

3429
01:53:28,850 --> 01:53:34,430
I have the music turned off in this game, and my music's not playing, so this is a very, very relaxing stroll for me.

3430
01:53:35,890 --> 01:53:39,090
It's all quiet and shit, and I'm just like, oh, this is so peaceful.

3431
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:43,150
And, you know, hanging out with my friends, and Mata might be dying, but it's okay.

3432
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:43,690
No, no, no, no, no.

3433
01:53:43,690 --> 01:53:44,810
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

3434
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:45,110
How are you doing, Matar?

3435
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:45,550
Are you good?

3436
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:46,570
I'm doing great.

3437
01:53:46,610 --> 01:53:47,510
You got it, you got it, Matar!

3438
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:49,130
You activated the bug nest, and now I'm running back.

3439
01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:49,230
I'm taking a swim.

3440
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:52,090
Taking a dive?

3441
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:53,710
Oh, you got rid of the outpost.

3442
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:53,970
Be careful not to drown.

3443
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:55,610
Genuinely.

3444
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:56,270
Can you actually?

3445
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:57,470
Yeah, you can.

3446
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:57,730
Probably.

3447
01:53:57,730 --> 01:54:02,250
Because, basically, your armor in the lore is really heavy, so you'll drown.

3448
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:02,690
Oh!

3449
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:04,230
Yep, you'll die.

3450
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:05,670
I die so many times.

3451
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:06,890
Oh, I'm sorry.

3452
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:07,130
Oh, Tenya.

3453
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:09,070
Have you been to Fuji-Q?

3454
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:11,110
Yeah, I have!

3455
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:15,890
What's your favorite, favorite um, rollercoaster thing to do there?

3456
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:16,970
It's great!

3457
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:18,450
It's great!

3458
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:19,790
It's crazy!

3459
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:21,330
Eigo!

3460
01:54:21,330 --> 01:54:21,730
Eigo!

3461
01:54:21,930 --> 01:54:22,230
Eigo!

3462
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:23,870
What's the name of it, though?

3463
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:24,050
Eigo?

3464
01:54:24,810 --> 01:54:25,210
Yeah!

3465
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:26,690
So what is it, what does it do?

3466
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:29,090
What is the attraction?

3467
01:54:29,770 --> 01:54:34,750
So usually, when you go on the rollercoaster, you have a place to put your feet, right?

3468
01:54:34,990 --> 01:54:35,450
Uh-huh.

3469
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:46,810
But on that one, it's like you're in the mid-air, so you have to take off your shoes, and you're flying around in the mid-air, and then there's the spinning, 30-60 degree, and a lot of stuff.

3470
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:48,730
Oh wait, that's the stuff I don't like.

3471
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:49,890
The seats spin, too.

3472
01:54:50,190 --> 01:54:51,470
It's really crazy.

3473
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:54,330
I also like Fujiyama, too.

3474
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:56,750
Nah, it's gonna be fine.

3475
01:54:57,430 --> 01:54:58,810
And what's Fujiyama like?

3476
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:02,370
Fujiyama is, I think it's the tallest one in Japan.

3477
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:05,050
Oh, is it like the proper rollercoaster?

3478
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:06,010
You go up, you go down?

3479
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:06,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3480
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:11,550
There's one, there's one at the top, you get to see, like, a good view of Mount Fuji.

3481
01:55:12,850 --> 01:55:14,690
Oh, I like that, I like that.

3482
01:55:15,410 --> 01:55:18,070
If you're wearing glasses, you have to take it off.

3483
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:19,870
Food?

3484
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:20,950
Food?

3485
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:23,110
It's fine, it's fine.

3486
01:55:25,570 --> 01:55:28,130
I think they have like a little...

3487
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:38,970
I don't know if they have a restaurant, because I've never been to, but they got a little like a market thingy going on outside, so you can just get some cheap food for 100 yen or 100 yen.

3488
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:40,530
I feel like they have that everywhere, right?

3489
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:41,130
Yeah, it's a little street.

3490
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:42,550
Oh, that sounds so good.

3491
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:44,290
That's not good.

3492
01:55:45,890 --> 01:55:47,210
Or they got the konbini.

3493
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:53,110
It's really cool, so we just go konbini and get some stuff, and we're just ready to go back on the rollercoaster.

3494
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:55,030
That's what I do.

3495
01:55:55,890 --> 01:56:02,450
It's because in, not in Japan, in like other countries, usually the whenever you go into the amusement park, you can't come out.

3496
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:06,010
So they make you curious that you order expensive food.

3497
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:06,370
What?

3498
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:07,810
I've always been able to... You can?

3499
01:56:07,810 --> 01:56:08,630
You can go back out.

3500
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:09,690
Really?

3501
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:10,250
Yeah.

3502
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:15,770
I guess maybe just like Canadian things.

3503
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:16,650
Because they...

3504
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:17,410
Oh my goodness.

3505
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:20,950
There's usually no food near it, so you basically have to eat over there.

3506
01:56:22,290 --> 01:56:22,870
Wait, really?

3507
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:23,790
Yeah.

3508
01:56:23,950 --> 01:56:27,770
But they let you leave, because they'll sometimes stamp your thing, right?

3509
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:30,730
Yeah, they give you a little stamp on your body.

3510
01:56:30,910 --> 01:56:31,890
Oh yeah, that's true.

3511
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:34,170
For a lot, there's no food.

3512
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:39,650
There's usually no food nearby, so that way you kind of have to buy food there, which is pretty expensive, right?

3513
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:39,830
Yeah, yeah.

3514
01:56:39,830 --> 01:56:40,770
Oh, there's a little man.

3515
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:41,470
There's a little man.

3516
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:44,090
Got a moosh, got a moosh.

3517
01:56:44,890 --> 01:56:45,710
Moosh, moosh, moosh.

3518
01:56:46,310 --> 01:56:47,970
I think it's a... Yeah, there you go.

3519
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:48,930
Hi, man!

3520
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:50,050
Hi, man!

3521
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:51,310
Can I punch the man?

3522
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:52,010
These are my clothes!

3523
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:53,150
I punched the man.

3524
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:55,390
Don't punch my people!

3525
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:57,010
Come here, little guy.

3526
01:56:58,550 --> 01:57:00,410
Give me your lunch money, idiot.

3527
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:02,410
Oh my god!

3528
01:57:02,870 --> 01:57:06,550
Wow, Mint, you've changed ever since you came back from your graduation.

3529
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:07,330
You've changed.

3530
01:57:07,330 --> 01:57:08,290
Oh my, oh my!

3531
01:57:08,290 --> 01:57:09,670
They're going after the little man!

3532
01:57:10,530 --> 01:57:11,090
Oh no!

3533
01:57:11,530 --> 01:57:12,530
Not the little man!

3534
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:14,970
Imagine being a little man in the world.

3535
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:19,570
The bugs are coming after you, the little ghosts are coming after you, everyone's coming after you.

3536
01:57:20,850 --> 01:57:21,710
Stop it!

3537
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:23,330
Stop it!

3538
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:24,910
Stop attacking me, you stupid little guy.

3539
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:26,370
Uh oh.

3540
01:57:26,490 --> 01:57:27,650
I can't get your butt.

3541
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:30,850
Oh, I almost... Oh, I killed him!

3542
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:32,230
Good job.

3543
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:33,330
You almost got me.

3544
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:34,150
Watch this.

3545
01:57:34,430 --> 01:57:34,970
Oh, yeah.

3546
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:35,470
I'm watching.

3547
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:36,710
Watch this.

3548
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:38,010
Watch out for the little man.

3549
01:57:39,630 --> 01:57:41,170
I kind of stood in front of him.

3550
01:57:41,390 --> 01:57:42,390
What's going on?

3551
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:43,550
What's going on?

3552
01:57:45,230 --> 01:57:45,850
I'm okay.

3553
01:57:45,970 --> 01:57:46,450
You're doing amazing.

3554
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:48,390
Oh, that was...

3555
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:49,510
How's he live?

3556
01:57:49,890 --> 01:57:52,510
I'm gonna go create more men.

3557
01:57:52,730 --> 01:57:54,070
Oh, we lost three.

3558
01:57:55,510 --> 01:57:56,450
Oh, no!

3559
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:57,490
Create more men.

3560
01:57:58,690 --> 01:58:00,470
I require more vestine.

3561
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:01,990
Watch out, Mint.

3562
01:58:02,530 --> 01:58:03,150
I'm watching.

3563
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:04,870
Oh, last reload.

3564
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:05,530
What's that mean?

3565
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:08,710
It means that's your last reload, baby.

3566
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:11,910
It's a fire one.

3567
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:15,610
Oh, I have to switch.

3568
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:17,630
He's gonna die right now.

3569
01:58:19,290 --> 01:58:20,330
Final reload.

3570
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:28,810
Uh oh.

3571
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:30,710
Don't worry.

3572
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:36,310
We only got ten minutes to save the world.

3573
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:41,290
As soon as you guys are done, I'll start activating the teleporter back home.

3574
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:42,210
Watch out, little man.

3575
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:42,970
Keep running.

3576
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:44,610
Watch out, Steve.

3577
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:47,270
Matata has the same bug build as me.

3578
01:58:47,430 --> 01:58:49,950
Are you also big-breasted and big-hipped?

3579
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:51,310
And six-clawed?

3580
01:58:51,810 --> 01:58:52,350
Let's go.

3581
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:55,830
I like how you did mention the big-breasted part.

3582
01:58:56,090 --> 01:58:57,690
Yeah, you know what, Matata?

3583
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:59,850
I went to your Twitter to see, like...

3584
01:58:59,850 --> 01:59:00,550
Yeah, big breasts?

3585
01:59:00,670 --> 01:59:03,450
Yeah, I saw big breasts on your fucking Twitter page.

3586
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:04,290
Uh-huh.

3587
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:04,630
Go on.

3588
01:59:05,150 --> 01:59:05,810
What do you mean?

3589
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:07,950
I don't know what that was all about.

3590
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:09,530
Now you got Mint's attention.

3591
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:13,210
You just have to mention big breasts.

3592
01:59:13,210 --> 01:59:13,830
You just have to mention big breasts.

3593
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:16,970
I gotta be polite when she's over here Googling about it.

3594
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:18,110
Sorry, Haruka, for interrupting.

3595
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:18,790
What were you saying?

3596
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:20,490
So you went to see big breasts and...

3597
01:59:20,490 --> 01:59:21,550
On your Twitter banner.

3598
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:23,170
I wanna know what the hell...

3599
01:59:23,730 --> 01:59:24,350
You like them?

3600
01:59:24,970 --> 01:59:26,110
We need to add Henya.

3601
01:59:26,210 --> 01:59:27,410
That initial Twitter banner.

3602
01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:29,250
It should be, like, Mies and Treya and Henya.

3603
01:59:29,970 --> 01:59:31,790
Wait, are you talking about that picture?

3604
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:32,410
Yup.

3605
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:35,450
You know exactly what picture I'm talking about.

3606
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:37,510
What the heck, Niall?

3607
01:59:38,990 --> 01:59:40,090
What the heck, Niall?

3608
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:41,790
Do we need more men?

3609
01:59:43,090 --> 01:59:43,710
No, we're all good.

3610
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:44,550
We just need to go home now.

3611
01:59:44,730 --> 01:59:45,150
Oh, okay.

3612
01:59:47,070 --> 01:59:49,130
I'm allergic to men now, so I'm going home.

3613
01:59:50,230 --> 01:59:50,630
I'm allergic to men now, so I'm going home.

3614
01:59:50,630 --> 01:59:52,790
What does the go home look like?

3615
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:54,450
It's where I am.

3616
01:59:54,510 --> 01:59:55,110
It's where I am.

3617
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:55,670
Come to where...

3618
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:58,350
Oh, yes, that's right.

3619
01:59:58,390 --> 01:59:58,770
That one.

3620
01:59:59,110 --> 01:59:59,970
Yeah, that one.

3621
01:59:59,970 --> 02:00:03,610
You can also press tab and you see that orange icon that has an arrow going up.

3622
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:04,150
Yeah.

3623
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:06,190
That's the extraction point.

3624
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:10,330
I can't start it right now because I got too many bugs around me, but I'll start it in just a minute.

3625
02:00:10,690 --> 02:00:11,450
Oh, hey, guys.

3626
02:00:12,150 --> 02:00:13,450
I found a friendship door.

3627
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,230
A friendship door?

3628
02:00:16,190 --> 02:00:17,730
Mint, do you want to come open this door with me?

3629
02:00:19,610 --> 02:00:20,870
I'd be honored.

3630
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:24,730
I'd be honored if you opened it with me.

3631
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:27,090
Oh, gosh, I'm out of stamina.

3632
02:00:28,290 --> 02:00:28,830
Tomodachi.

3633
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:29,430
I'm coming.

3634
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:32,630
This is the ritual to be like, welcome back.

3635
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:33,490
Friendship door.

3636
02:00:34,650 --> 02:00:35,970
Alright, here we go.

3637
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:37,370
Yay!

3638
02:00:40,090 --> 02:00:40,930
Oh, shit.

3639
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:42,230
We might have got some cool stuff.

3640
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:43,230
Oh, yeah.

3641
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:44,550
Oh, yeah.

3642
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:47,850
What did we get?

3643
02:00:48,210 --> 02:00:50,710
We got a sample and...

3644
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:51,570
What's that?

3645
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:53,550
A star wall.

3646
02:00:53,910 --> 02:00:55,010
And some stims.

3647
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:57,650
That's a gun.

3648
02:00:57,650 --> 02:01:00,510
Can I please get a little bit of help soon, please?

3649
02:01:01,090 --> 02:01:02,070
You're a gamer.

3650
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:02,850
You've got this.

3651
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:03,570
We'll take our time.

3652
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:04,890
I'm just going to take a leisurely stroll.

3653
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:08,610
I don't think I have any...

3654
02:01:08,610 --> 02:01:09,650
I have like zero stims.

3655
02:01:09,650 --> 02:01:10,270
You got it.

3656
02:01:13,530 --> 02:01:15,330
My boba don't have stim packs.

3657
02:01:15,530 --> 02:01:16,810
They're filled with momos.

3658
02:01:17,490 --> 02:01:19,050
That's where I hide my momos before I eat them.

3659
02:01:19,050 --> 02:01:21,030
I'm pretty sure you hide some stim packs inside.

3660
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:21,770
You got this.

3661
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:23,890
No, I hide my momos before I eat them.

3662
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:25,010
How do I get the other packs?

3663
02:01:27,090 --> 02:01:27,490
Samples.

3664
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:29,250
Samples!

3665
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:32,590
Wait, how do I get around there?

3666
02:01:32,810 --> 02:01:33,190
Uh-oh.

3667
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:35,030
He's over here.

3668
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:38,450
I got you, fam.

3669
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:39,950
Thanks, fam.

3670
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:41,190
Love you.

3671
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:43,790
I thought you were gay.

3672
02:01:44,730 --> 02:01:46,130
Take my ego!

3673
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:47,090
Yay!

3674
02:01:48,210 --> 02:01:49,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Henya!

3675
02:01:52,830 --> 02:01:56,550
I would think that was personal if I didn't know you a little better, Henya.

3676
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:58,570
No, you didn't die.

3677
02:01:58,650 --> 02:01:59,410
You're fine.

3678
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:02,030
I didn't die yet.

3679
02:02:02,070 --> 02:02:03,230
The night is young, Henya.

3680
02:02:04,330 --> 02:02:06,250
Anything can happen in full of boba.

3681
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:07,350
You didn't die.

3682
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:08,090
That's important.

3683
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:11,330
I mean, Min, we can just watch this from afar if you want.

3684
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,170
I like to get bloody.

3685
02:02:13,450 --> 02:02:13,590
The night is young and filled with boba.

3686
02:02:14,230 --> 02:02:14,850
Oh, okay.

3687
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:15,350
There you go.

3688
02:02:16,290 --> 02:02:17,850
She's a little...

3689
02:02:17,850 --> 02:02:19,110
Watch out for your right...

3690
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:19,870
Freak!

3691
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:21,050
I'm a little freak!

3692
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:22,210
Yeah, you are.

3693
02:02:22,350 --> 02:02:23,210
I want your blood on me!

3694
02:02:24,790 --> 02:02:25,230
Yep.

3695
02:02:25,330 --> 02:02:27,050
The smaller they are, the more...

3696
02:02:27,810 --> 02:02:27,990
Freak!

3697
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:30,030
The closer they are to hell.

3698
02:02:30,450 --> 02:02:31,190
Yeah, there we go.

3699
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:33,070
Oh, that's definitely not me then.

3700
02:02:35,730 --> 02:02:36,170
Freak!

3701
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:38,510
Oh, Henya, you're pretty small and pretty crazy.

3702
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:40,870
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

3703
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:43,870
Henya, I think you're fucked up like the rest of us.

3704
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:47,990
Not as much as you!

3705
02:02:48,730 --> 02:02:49,950
Um, what do you mean?

3706
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,990
Nah, not as much as you!

3707
02:02:53,610 --> 02:02:55,010
I don't know, I might have...

3708
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:57,190
killed a few things in my day.

3709
02:02:58,110 --> 02:02:58,550
That's in Nepal.

3710
02:02:58,550 --> 02:03:01,450
Haru, you're the most toxic Canadian I ever see it.

3711
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:01,790
Yes.

3712
02:03:02,290 --> 02:03:03,710
It's not gonna hit us, you know.

3713
02:03:03,790 --> 02:03:04,370
I know.

3714
02:03:04,450 --> 02:03:05,830
I put it over there, though.

3715
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:07,690
Haru, Haru, Haru!

3716
02:03:07,890 --> 02:03:10,650
You're the most toxic Canadian I've ever seen it before.

3717
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:12,890
That's an honor.

3718
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:15,570
Because there's not a lot of us in this world anymore.

3719
02:03:16,930 --> 02:03:18,550
We Canadians are going extinct.

3720
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:19,970
Canadians are going extinct.

3721
02:03:21,050 --> 02:03:22,290
There's barely any Canadians left.

3722
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:24,610
Every time Americans I meet online, I see one Canadian.

3723
02:03:24,610 --> 02:03:27,330
And we all go feral because we never meet a Canadian online.

3724
02:03:27,630 --> 02:03:28,250
It's true.

3725
02:03:28,370 --> 02:03:31,010
I feel like there's so many Canadian VTubers.

3726
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:32,210
There are.

3727
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:34,110
Yeah, there are so many.

3728
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:36,770
Yeah, but for us Canadians, we can't...

3729
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:37,270
Okay.

3730
02:03:37,890 --> 02:03:41,090
I don't know how to explain for us Canadians, we don't see each other ever.

3731
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:41,750
Uh oh.

3732
02:03:41,850 --> 02:03:44,630
Wait, wait, can you tell by their... how they talk?

3733
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:46,410
Can you tell they're Canadian or American?

3734
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:47,230
No!

3735
02:03:47,230 --> 02:03:48,230
Can you tell?

3736
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:50,730
Uh, no.

3737
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:51,830
Oh.

3738
02:03:52,230 --> 02:03:57,130
Because we've been so critically online that our accent gets hidden away.

3739
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:58,190
It does.

3740
02:03:59,290 --> 02:04:00,770
I see it.

3741
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:04,070
It only happens with some words like sorry, bag, tag, leg.

3742
02:04:04,330 --> 02:04:04,930
Bagel.

3743
02:04:04,930 --> 02:04:06,190
And bagel.

3744
02:04:06,210 --> 02:04:06,890
I say bagel.

3745
02:04:07,610 --> 02:04:08,210
Bagel.

3746
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:11,450
What is the Canadian way of saying bagel?

3747
02:04:12,030 --> 02:04:12,630
Bagel.

3748
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:13,470
Bagel?

3749
02:04:13,470 --> 02:04:14,110
No, it's bagel.

3750
02:04:14,190 --> 02:04:14,770
It's bagel.

3751
02:04:16,710 --> 02:04:17,230
Bagel.

3752
02:04:19,470 --> 02:04:20,510
Sweet liberty!

3753
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:22,210
My leg!

3754
02:04:22,610 --> 02:04:23,530
My leg!

3755
02:04:23,970 --> 02:04:26,830
I feel really patriotic right now.

3756
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:27,490
I feel really patriotic right now.

3757
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:28,250
Right?

3758
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:30,210
This game just brings out the patriotism.

3759
02:04:30,230 --> 02:04:34,090
My guy has survived three missions and it's so fucking dirty.

3760
02:04:34,270 --> 02:04:35,430
Holy shit, he needs a bath.

3761
02:04:36,410 --> 02:04:38,230
I am so covered by blood.

3762
02:04:38,730 --> 02:04:38,870
I am so covered by blood.

3763
02:04:39,970 --> 02:04:43,230
Haru, can you show her where to buy stratagems and stuff?

3764
02:04:44,110 --> 02:04:44,550
Minto!

3765
02:04:44,690 --> 02:04:45,650
And where to buy everything.

3766
02:04:45,870 --> 02:04:46,510
I have to pee.

3767
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:48,170
I trust you guys.

3768
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:50,670
Minto!

3769
02:04:51,730 --> 02:04:53,490
It's this computer thing.

3770
02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:54,790
You press E to ship management.

3771
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:57,330
And then you see...

3772
02:04:57,330 --> 02:04:58,530
Go to stratagems.

3773
02:04:59,390 --> 02:05:00,590
And then ship module.

3774
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:01,650
This is where you get...

3775
02:05:02,510 --> 02:05:09,070
So on the top, this is where you see all your samples, all your requisition slips, and then the blue icon is your super samples.

3776
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:09,710
Right?

3777
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:13,210
And so this is where you get all your stratagems.

3778
02:05:14,030 --> 02:05:16,330
Which you need all the requisition slips for.

3779
02:05:17,070 --> 02:05:24,010
But the ship module, if you go here, this is where you can unlock things for your ship which helps enhance your stratagems that you use.

3780
02:05:25,630 --> 02:05:27,090
I can't get anything.

3781
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:27,770
But that's okay.

3782
02:05:30,210 --> 02:05:35,610
If you play this game a lot, we'll be grinding and get you so many samples and your ship will be fucking clogging.

3783
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:36,530
Yeah!

3784
02:05:38,290 --> 02:05:38,690
Yeah!

3785
02:05:39,390 --> 02:05:39,790
Yeah!

3786
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:40,570
Yay!

3787
02:05:41,530 --> 02:05:42,650
Well yeah, that's that.

3788
02:05:42,830 --> 02:05:45,350
Thank you for watching my tutorial.

3789
02:05:45,650 --> 02:05:46,990
Make sure to like and subscribe.

3790
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:47,830
Wait, so I can buy...

3791
02:05:47,830 --> 02:05:49,790
I can get a sniper rifle?

3792
02:05:50,530 --> 02:05:51,130
Yeah!

3793
02:05:53,530 --> 02:05:55,630
Wait, against light vehicle armor.

3794
02:05:55,730 --> 02:05:57,310
So not the butts.

3795
02:05:58,310 --> 02:06:02,710
I mean you could do for bugs, but it's more so if they have penetration armor on them.

3796
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:04,050
I said the butts.

3797
02:06:05,870 --> 02:06:07,070
The butt.

3798
02:06:08,270 --> 02:06:09,330
Oh there's...

3799
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:11,490
The anti-tank.

3800
02:06:11,490 --> 02:06:13,210
That's the thing that will blow up the butt.

3801
02:06:13,810 --> 02:06:14,250
Yeah!

3802
02:06:15,850 --> 02:06:16,910
Blow up the butt.

3803
02:06:18,430 --> 02:06:19,090
What is this?

3804
02:06:19,130 --> 02:06:19,830
Finding Nemo?

3805
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:22,830
I kinda want the rifle though.

3806
02:06:24,370 --> 02:06:25,390
It's up to you.

3807
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:26,750
I like being a sniper.

3808
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:28,370
Sniper?

3809
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:30,010
I love being a sniper too.

3810
02:06:30,070 --> 02:06:30,570
It's one of my favorites.

3811
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:33,830
I think I haven't tried it yet.

3812
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:36,910
But I'm shit at the sniper at every game, so...

3813
02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:38,090
I try.

3814
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:40,390
If you scroll...

3815
02:06:40,390 --> 02:06:40,970
Oh there is!

3816
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:42,890
Oh the...

3817
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,090
The eagle...

3818
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:48,010
Strike and die.

3819
02:06:52,930 --> 02:06:55,050
Do you guys do the eagles?

3820
02:06:55,970 --> 02:06:57,510
Yeah, I use the eagles a lot.

3821
02:06:57,630 --> 02:06:58,630
I use the eagle air strike.

3822
02:06:58,930 --> 02:07:00,130
It's the one that I use.

3823
02:07:00,130 --> 02:07:00,450
Me too!

3824
02:07:01,770 --> 02:07:05,110
But I got the 5 kilogram ton bomb.

3825
02:07:06,230 --> 02:07:07,350
Yeah, you have that one.

3826
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:08,950
And I think you also use the cluster bomb.

3827
02:07:09,450 --> 02:07:10,550
The cluster bomb?

3828
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:14,070
Yeah, it's when you throw and it's a cluster.

3829
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:17,150
And while your air strike goes in a straight line.

3830
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:18,050
Where you throw.

3831
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:20,470
Yeah!

3832
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:22,310
So cute!

3833
02:07:22,870 --> 02:07:23,790
What's that thing?

3834
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:25,570
The eagle air strike.

3835
02:07:26,050 --> 02:07:27,510
An eagle never misses.

3836
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:29,990
Eagle never misses.

3837
02:07:30,270 --> 02:07:31,370
But it misses.

3838
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:32,930
But it never misses!

3839
02:07:32,930 --> 02:07:33,830
Yeah, it never misses.

3840
02:07:35,430 --> 02:07:37,490
It's not them missing, it's us missing.

3841
02:07:38,030 --> 02:07:39,370
Okay, hold on.

3842
02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:40,930
What's worse?

3843
02:07:41,010 --> 02:07:41,810
Them or us?

3844
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:44,710
Us.

3845
02:07:45,650 --> 02:07:46,950
Because we're...

3846
02:07:47,730 --> 02:07:48,450
Wrong!

3847
02:07:48,450 --> 02:07:49,970
No eagle misses!

3848
02:07:51,310 --> 02:07:52,030
Yeah!

3849
02:07:52,510 --> 02:07:53,010
Yeah!

3850
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:57,150
If it misses, it's the government's fault!

3851
02:07:57,790 --> 02:07:58,510
Yeah!

3852
02:07:58,630 --> 02:07:59,350
Government!

3853
02:08:00,030 --> 02:08:00,750
Yeah!

3854
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:06,710
You can get the eagle if you want.

3855
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:07,310
I like the eagle.

3856
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:08,770
I don't know.

3857
02:08:08,810 --> 02:08:09,550
I like eagle too!

3858
02:08:09,630 --> 02:08:12,590
I have like a bomb thing but I haven't used it.

3859
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:15,270
Because I'm bad about remembering to use it.

3860
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:16,670
Well...

3861
02:08:16,670 --> 02:08:18,110
You'll get used to it.

3862
02:08:18,270 --> 02:08:20,310
Maybe I will get the rifle though.

3863
02:08:22,670 --> 02:08:23,490
It's up to you.

3864
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:26,010
The best part is experimenting and having fun.

3865
02:08:26,690 --> 02:08:27,130
It's up to you.

3866
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:27,130
The best part is experimenting and having fun.

3867
02:08:27,210 --> 02:08:27,650
Whip.

3868
02:08:29,050 --> 02:08:30,650
Get the sniper then be disappointed?

3869
02:08:31,110 --> 02:08:32,410
Why is it disappointment?

3870
02:08:32,930 --> 02:08:35,190
Well, it's a shitty gun.

3871
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:36,870
Well, it's a shitty gun.

3872
02:08:37,510 --> 02:08:38,650
I see.

3873
02:08:38,830 --> 02:08:40,270
The material rifle.

3874
02:08:40,530 --> 02:08:41,450
I'm looking at your stream.

3875
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:42,170
The material rifle.

3876
02:08:42,510 --> 02:08:43,130
Yeah.

3877
02:08:44,050 --> 02:08:45,170
It's a shit gun.

3878
02:08:46,070 --> 02:08:48,710
Wait, the sniper is good now?

3879
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:50,130
Oh, it's good now?

3880
02:08:50,570 --> 02:08:51,190
Hi!

3881
02:08:51,350 --> 02:08:54,350
Oh, it's for bots.

3882
02:08:54,810 --> 02:08:55,430
I'm back.

3883
02:08:56,250 --> 02:08:57,490
Welcome back.

3884
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:00,490
Welcome back.

3885
02:09:00,490 --> 02:09:00,850
Welcome back, master.

3886
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:02,690
Master.

3887
02:09:03,450 --> 02:09:06,090
Welcome back, master.

3888
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:08,170
Welcome back, master.

3889
02:09:08,170 --> 02:09:08,890
Welcome back, master.

3890
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:09,310
Welcome back, master.

3891
02:09:11,570 --> 02:09:13,170
It's a fire gun.

3892
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:15,210
Fire gun.

3893
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,350
Oh, Henya.

3894
02:09:18,470 --> 02:09:19,930
I need your advice.

3895
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:21,890
What is it?

3896
02:09:21,890 --> 02:09:23,670
A friend and I disagree on this.

3897
02:09:24,210 --> 02:09:30,930
When I go to maid cafes with this friend, I will say I love you to the maids.

3898
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:31,810
And they love it.

3899
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:33,410
And my friend says it's embarrassing.

3900
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:34,370
What do you think?

3901
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:37,130
Well, the thing is I never really go outside.

3902
02:09:37,230 --> 02:09:38,410
I never went to the maid cafes.

3903
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:40,090
I don't know how to interact with them.

3904
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:44,510
But do you think it is embarrassing if I say...

3905
02:09:44,510 --> 02:09:44,590
Nah!

3906
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:47,090
Nah, people love it.

3907
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:48,650
They love it.

3908
02:09:48,650 --> 02:09:50,030
I'm telling you they love it.

3909
02:09:50,030 --> 02:09:52,270
They light up or they're too polite to say otherwise.

3910
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:53,010
But they love it.

3911
02:09:54,450 --> 02:09:56,370
I'll tell my friend what you said.

3912
02:09:56,630 --> 02:09:58,190
I'll make sure to tell my friend.

3913
02:09:58,230 --> 02:09:59,030
I'll let her know.

3914
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:00,770
She's wrong.

3915
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:02,450
Can I tell her?

3916
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:04,030
She's stinky and wrong.

3917
02:10:05,490 --> 02:10:10,150
Why do I have a feeling that the friend you're talking about is in this call right now?

3918
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:10,870
Why do I have a feeling that the friend you're talking about is in this call right now?

3919
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:11,590
That's crazy, Haruka.

3920
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:13,150
No, no way.

3921
02:10:13,150 --> 02:10:15,430
That friend is here.

3922
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:16,390
No, not at all.

3923
02:10:16,610 --> 02:10:18,310
That would be so awful.

3924
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:20,130
Yeah, I know.

3925
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:23,670
I need to get into the mission.

3926
02:10:24,150 --> 02:10:25,470
I need to get into the mission.

3927
02:10:27,710 --> 02:10:28,630
I did it.

3928
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:39,810
Yeah, they probably suck.

3929
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:42,790
I'm just looking at Mint's face.

3930
02:10:42,990 --> 02:10:44,890
She has a smile like eyes are gone.

3931
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:49,230
Why are you looking at my face, Haruka?

3932
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:50,870
You want to kiss it or something?

3933
02:10:51,070 --> 02:10:51,590
What do you want?

3934
02:10:52,270 --> 02:10:52,490
I want to kiss it.

3935
02:10:52,510 --> 02:10:53,830
It's been, what, three years?

3936
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:56,910
I haven't seen your face for three years.

3937
02:10:57,250 --> 02:10:58,070
I'm lonely.

3938
02:10:59,130 --> 02:11:02,530
Honestly, I could have gone a bit more time without seeing your face.

3939
02:11:02,650 --> 02:11:03,190
But here we are.

3940
02:11:04,210 --> 02:11:05,770
It's your fault I'm here.

3941
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:12,470
I don't even understand where I screwed up in my summoning ritual.

3942
02:11:13,130 --> 02:11:14,310
I have no idea.

3943
02:11:14,490 --> 02:11:15,750
It is your fault.

3944
02:11:16,030 --> 02:11:17,570
It's because you were you.

3945
02:11:17,790 --> 02:11:20,310
It's because you just did your own thing.

3946
02:11:20,310 --> 02:11:21,050
You're a screw-up.

3947
02:11:21,130 --> 02:11:22,590
That's just the natural part.

3948
02:11:23,910 --> 02:11:26,190
You sound just like my mom.

3949
02:11:28,690 --> 02:11:29,430
Oh, sorry.

3950
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:31,630
My Okasan says the same thing.

3951
02:11:31,910 --> 02:11:32,970
My Okan.

3952
02:11:33,530 --> 02:11:33,930
Mama.

3953
02:11:40,690 --> 02:11:42,230
I love that song.

3954
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:53,210
The song they were singing earlier.

3955
02:11:53,450 --> 02:11:54,310
Bohemian Rhapsody?

3956
02:11:54,910 --> 02:11:55,490
Yes.

3957
02:11:56,190 --> 02:11:56,690
It is.

3958
02:11:57,450 --> 02:12:00,210
Okay, so I have not played this before.

3959
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:01,030
What?

3960
02:12:01,170 --> 02:12:02,030
Oh, is it a siege?

3961
02:12:02,690 --> 02:12:05,410
Okay, we have to go in and we have to defend the siege.

3962
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:08,210
Defend the siege.

3963
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:10,530
Siege.

3964
02:12:10,530 --> 02:12:10,730
Come here.

3965
02:12:10,890 --> 02:12:12,150
Is Mint not streaming on Twitch?

3966
02:12:12,190 --> 02:12:15,190
Press exclamation mark Mint, it'll get you to her YouTube channel.

3967
02:12:15,370 --> 02:12:17,050
Sorry, I only stream on YouTube.

3968
02:12:18,150 --> 02:12:20,830
But if you ever watch YouTube streamers, I don't care.

3969
02:12:21,570 --> 02:12:22,630
How do we get into this building?

3970
02:12:23,370 --> 02:12:24,390
I'm going over here.

3971
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:25,230
I'm here.

3972
02:12:26,190 --> 02:12:27,050
How do I get in?

3973
02:12:28,390 --> 02:12:30,470
We have to go in up top.

3974
02:12:30,670 --> 02:12:31,130
Okay.

3975
02:12:31,930 --> 02:12:32,910
I'm following you.

3976
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:35,530
I'm not even sure I'm going the right way.

3977
02:12:35,630 --> 02:12:37,270
There should be an opening around there.

3978
02:12:37,410 --> 02:12:38,210
If you look in the map.

3979
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:39,990
I think we went.

3980
02:12:40,070 --> 02:12:40,890
I'm so sorry.

3981
02:12:40,970 --> 02:12:43,410
I dropped us at the completely wrong place.

3982
02:12:44,190 --> 02:12:44,790
It's okay.

3983
02:12:46,210 --> 02:12:47,270
I'm so sorry.

3984
02:12:47,410 --> 02:12:48,870
I can't believe you would do this.

3985
02:12:48,990 --> 02:12:50,550
How dare you.

3986
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:52,750
How dare you.

3987
02:12:53,770 --> 02:12:55,290
Mint, where...

3988
02:12:55,290 --> 02:12:57,070
The mission is going to start.

3989
02:12:57,190 --> 02:12:57,930
Blah, blah, blah.

3990
02:12:58,970 --> 02:13:04,010
Also, in the main missions, you just have to complete the main mission.

3991
02:13:04,090 --> 02:13:09,130
Even if everybody dies and the timer runs out, as long as you complete the main mission, you'll still get the score.

3992
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:10,810
Come in, come in.

3993
02:13:11,290 --> 02:13:13,050
I have some doors to close.

3994
02:13:13,410 --> 02:13:14,690
Okay, wait.

3995
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:15,190
I'm sorry.

3996
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:16,050
We're still running.

3997
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:19,510
I'm out of stamina.

3998
02:13:20,090 --> 02:13:21,110
Just keep running.

3999
02:13:21,290 --> 02:13:21,750
Just keep running.

4000
02:13:21,910 --> 02:13:22,070
Okay.

4001
02:13:22,970 --> 02:13:23,910
There's a bug breach.

4002
02:13:24,190 --> 02:13:26,390
Yeah, there is a bug breach.

4003
02:13:28,790 --> 02:13:30,070
You know what I'm going to do?

4004
02:13:30,150 --> 02:13:32,890
I'm going to put a gatling cannon there.

4005
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:33,950
Careful.

4006
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:34,350
Just run.

4007
02:13:34,390 --> 02:13:34,870
Just run, Mint.

4008
02:13:34,890 --> 02:13:35,230
Just run.

4009
02:13:35,310 --> 02:13:35,770
I'm running.

4010
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:38,810
Just run and then we're going to...

4011
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:40,290
I'm running.

4012
02:13:40,490 --> 02:13:41,550
And then where do we close the door?

4013
02:13:41,610 --> 02:13:42,470
Is this where we close the door?

4014
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:45,150
Yeah, just go in first and close the door.

4015
02:13:45,650 --> 02:13:47,150
We run in first and then close it?

4016
02:13:47,830 --> 02:13:48,190
Yeah.

4017
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:49,150
Okay.

4018
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:50,230
Are you in this?

4019
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:51,290
I think they're coming in.

4020
02:13:52,850 --> 02:13:53,190
Oh!

4021
02:13:54,110 --> 02:13:54,650
Oh, don't worry.

4022
02:13:54,690 --> 02:13:55,010
I got this one.

4023
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:57,130
And now they're going to attack the door, so we got to...

4024
02:13:57,870 --> 02:13:58,210
Okay.

4025
02:13:58,370 --> 02:13:59,950
Oh, it's like a defense tower, right?

4026
02:14:00,290 --> 02:14:01,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4027
02:14:01,150 --> 02:14:02,890
It's a new mission mode that they added.

4028
02:14:03,230 --> 02:14:03,930
Oh, okay.

4029
02:14:04,190 --> 02:14:04,650
All right.

4030
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:05,930
Mata, go down here.

4031
02:14:06,050 --> 02:14:06,270
Oh, yeah.

4032
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:08,010
I'm going to close this other door too.

4033
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:10,370
Oh, hello.

4034
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:12,710
And then we shoot them from up top.

4035
02:14:12,890 --> 02:14:13,030
Nice!

4036
02:14:13,970 --> 02:14:16,050
If you guys want to come in over here, you guys can.

4037
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:16,590
Okay.

4038
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:19,450
I'm throwing the bomb.

4039
02:14:19,530 --> 02:14:20,170
I'm throwing the bomb.

4040
02:14:20,430 --> 02:14:20,850
Do it.

4041
02:14:20,870 --> 02:14:21,050
Do it.

4042
02:14:21,050 --> 02:14:21,210
Do it.

4043
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:24,730
Where's a good place to...

4044
02:14:24,730 --> 02:14:26,970
Oh, they broke the door because we weren't defending it.

4045
02:14:27,230 --> 02:14:27,590
Oh.

4046
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:28,650
Oh, be careful.

4047
02:14:29,190 --> 02:14:29,970
Oh, my goodness.

4048
02:14:30,190 --> 02:14:31,130
How do I use this thing?

4049
02:14:32,570 --> 02:14:32,930
It's okay.

4050
02:14:33,030 --> 02:14:33,210
It's okay.

4051
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:33,350
It's okay.

4052
02:14:33,390 --> 02:14:33,850
We'll be fine.

4053
02:14:33,930 --> 02:14:34,270
We'll be fine.

4054
02:14:34,910 --> 02:14:35,530
Oh, my bad.

4055
02:14:37,270 --> 02:14:39,090
One of you summoned me.

4056
02:14:39,610 --> 02:14:39,970
Sorry.

4057
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:40,830
I summoned you.

4058
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:41,450
I got you.

4059
02:14:41,530 --> 02:14:41,550
I got you.

4060
02:14:41,550 --> 02:14:42,530
I'm shooting a bug.

4061
02:14:44,050 --> 02:14:45,890
I really did summon onto the wrong place.

4062
02:14:45,930 --> 02:14:46,350
My bad.

4063
02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:46,790
Sweet.

4064
02:14:46,910 --> 02:14:47,750
Reliver key down.

4065
02:14:47,850 --> 02:14:48,090
No.

4066
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:48,810
It's out of bullets.

4067
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:49,930
How do I get out of this thing?

4068
02:14:50,350 --> 02:14:50,750
Wait.

4069
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:52,750
Oh, no.

4070
02:14:52,850 --> 02:14:53,250
Wait.

4071
02:14:53,350 --> 02:14:53,750
I'm stuck.

4072
02:14:53,810 --> 02:14:54,250
Okay, guys.

4073
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:55,790
We have to launch the rockets.

4074
02:14:55,910 --> 02:14:56,290
It looks like.

4075
02:14:56,670 --> 02:14:57,310
Uh-oh.

4076
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:57,990
Uh-oh.

4077
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:58,150
Uh-oh.

4078
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:00,510
How do I get out of the way?

4079
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:01,570
E?

4080
02:15:06,290 --> 02:15:06,990
Oh, E.

4081
02:15:07,190 --> 02:15:07,590
Thanks.

4082
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:08,550
Thanks, chat.

4083
02:15:08,990 --> 02:15:10,790
We can also fall back, by the way.

4084
02:15:10,810 --> 02:15:12,730
If some of these are open, we can fall back.

4085
02:15:13,390 --> 02:15:15,210
Matara killed me, so...

4086
02:15:15,850 --> 02:15:17,150
I don't know what she's talking about.

4087
02:15:17,150 --> 02:15:19,350
Uh, I have the... I have the...

4088
02:15:19,350 --> 02:15:20,290
I have the facts.

4089
02:15:20,590 --> 02:15:21,570
Oh, it doesn't automatically.

4090
02:15:21,930 --> 02:15:22,630
Okay, okay, okay.

4091
02:15:23,310 --> 02:15:24,650
Don't know what she's talking about.

4092
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:25,010
It doesn't automatically.

4093
02:15:25,550 --> 02:15:26,590
Just protect the place.

4094
02:15:26,590 --> 02:15:28,050
Oh, I spawn inside of a man.

4095
02:15:29,390 --> 02:15:30,190
Holding doors.

4096
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:30,590
Holding doors.

4097
02:15:30,590 --> 02:15:30,730
Oh my god.

4098
02:15:30,730 --> 02:15:31,650
You're just like my momos.

4099
02:15:31,930 --> 02:15:32,890
That's how they are born.

4100
02:15:35,110 --> 02:15:36,150
Oh, I should have brought shirts.

4101
02:15:36,490 --> 02:15:38,130
I actually do not know what mission this is.

4102
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:38,670
Oh, hello.

4103
02:15:43,230 --> 02:15:44,730
Oh, they closed the door on us.

4104
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:45,270
But it's okay.

4105
02:15:45,390 --> 02:15:45,890
It's okay.

4106
02:15:45,950 --> 02:15:46,910
They don't love us.

4107
02:15:47,150 --> 02:15:47,330
It's fine.

4108
02:15:47,810 --> 02:15:48,390
It's fine.

4109
02:15:48,470 --> 02:15:50,270
Hey, I wouldn't need her if I was them.

4110
02:15:51,570 --> 02:15:52,850
Yeah, then come back here.

4111
02:15:52,950 --> 02:15:54,190
I don't want to see your face anymore.

4112
02:15:54,970 --> 02:15:56,750
We can also open it from our side.

4113
02:15:56,910 --> 02:15:57,270
Tascado!

4114
02:15:58,370 --> 02:15:59,790
How does that feel, Mint?

4115
02:15:59,790 --> 02:16:01,930
You love this, right?

4116
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:02,730
I absolutely love it!

4117
02:16:03,490 --> 02:16:04,290
What the fuck?

4118
02:16:05,370 --> 02:16:05,770
Yeah!

4119
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:06,770
Call me gross!

4120
02:16:07,730 --> 02:16:08,650
Call me gross!

4121
02:16:11,170 --> 02:16:13,450
Call me stinky, gross, and disgusting.

4122
02:16:14,170 --> 02:16:15,910
Mint, I don't know you're a masochist.

4123
02:16:16,530 --> 02:16:18,950
Yeah, that's one of my, you know, the M in Mint.

4124
02:16:19,650 --> 02:16:23,310
M, M, M, M, S, S, S.

4125
02:16:23,570 --> 02:16:23,710
M, M, M, M, S, S, S.

4126
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:25,350
Okay.

4127
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:27,730
I am doing a gatling.

4128
02:16:27,730 --> 02:16:28,930
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

4129
02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:30,450
I put my gatling turd now.

4130
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:31,910
Oh,

4131
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:36,960
good eagle.

4132
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:39,080
I hope my gatling is activated.

4133
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:39,920
Watch out!

4134
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:41,600
Ooh!

4135
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:43,820
Did I screw it up?

4136
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:44,880
Did I screw up my gatling?

4137
02:16:45,380 --> 02:16:46,520
I think it died.

4138
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:47,800
I think it got exploded.

4139
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:49,200
Yeah, I accidentally screwed it up.

4140
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:50,420
It had no bullets, though.

4141
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:51,160
It had no bullets.

4142
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:52,660
What?

4143
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:54,760
I need more bullets!

4144
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:56,280
More bullets!

4145
02:16:56,380 --> 02:16:57,160
I need more bullets!

4146
02:16:57,300 --> 02:16:57,320
More bullets!

4147
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:00,900
I'm gonna go up here and I'm gonna fight.

4148
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:02,580
Watch out for my laser, Fanta.

4149
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:03,480
Good job, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4150
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:05,860
Ooh!

4151
02:17:08,460 --> 02:17:10,180
Wow, it's just like...

4152
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:12,480
Oh, wait, I can also use laze.

4153
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:13,080
Or not laze.

4154
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:14,480
I have an eagle.

4155
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:18,180
Wait until they start coming.

4156
02:17:18,340 --> 02:17:19,440
Wait until you see like that.

4157
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:22,020
Look at you, you're an original.

4158
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:22,840
I mean, a natural.

4159
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:23,920
I'm an original.

4160
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:28,320
Oh, that is smart.

4161
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:29,160
Look at you.

4162
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:31,380
So, if I...

4163
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:34,500
You're a big natural.

4164
02:17:34,820 --> 02:17:35,060
Oh, oh, oh.

4165
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:37,420
You're a large natural.

4166
02:17:37,820 --> 02:17:38,380
I'm a natural?

4167
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:39,880
You're a big natural.

4168
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:43,480
Then I throw it.

4169
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:44,640
Yeah.

4170
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:48,960
Say hello to Granati.

4171
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:52,140
The way you're facing is the way you're like going down the line, basically.

4172
02:17:52,340 --> 02:17:53,580
Think of like your...

4173
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:55,480
It's like a basketball.

4174
02:17:55,900 --> 02:17:56,580
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

4175
02:17:57,260 --> 02:17:57,660
Let's see.

4176
02:17:58,600 --> 02:17:59,760
Come here, I have ammo.

4177
02:18:00,140 --> 02:18:00,700
You do?

4178
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:05,540
Oh, there's ammo right here.

4179
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:07,720
Oh, you guys, I just had a connection error.

4180
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:08,120
Oh, wait.

4181
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:09,920
You can come back.

4182
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:12,080
You can jump back on me from the game.

4183
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:12,700
I can?

4184
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:14,800
You can jump back from Steam, yeah.

4185
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:15,560
Okay, okay.

4186
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:16,940
I don't know what just happened.

4187
02:18:16,980 --> 02:18:17,880
Oh, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

4188
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:19,260
Sorry, it was not me, it was Mint.

4189
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:21,520
No, I know, but I can still give you a refill.

4190
02:18:21,980 --> 02:18:22,500
Oh, thank you.

4191
02:18:22,620 --> 02:18:23,880
That's so nice, you can rejoin.

4192
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,500
Wait, so, how do I... I just from Steam?

4193
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:29,340
You just right-click on Michael, Steve, and then click on join.

4194
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:30,180
Okay, okay, okay.

4195
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:33,260
Join the game.

4196
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:35,560
And then, I don't...

4197
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:36,820
Do you think your turret's gonna...

4198
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:39,440
What?

4199
02:18:39,440 --> 02:18:40,060
What?

4200
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:42,780
How do you go, like, really far?

4201
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:43,460
We can hear you.

4202
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:47,840
Oh, I was gonna say, do you think your turret's gonna chance kill me at some point?

4203
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:48,240
I don't know.

4204
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:51,900
No, no, it's not going to.

4205
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:54,180
Are the bugs coming from the other side, you guys?

4206
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:55,020
By the way?

4207
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:56,080
By any chance?

4208
02:18:56,140 --> 02:18:58,100
This is the only way?

4209
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:00,620
I'm coming in!

4210
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:01,900
I'm coming in hot!

4211
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:05,440
I'm coming in spicy.

4212
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:07,740
Come back in spicy hot.

4213
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:08,180
Maybe that's a good thing.

4214
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,960
I wonder if there's, like, a server network connection.

4215
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:13,540
I wonder if there's, like, a server network connection.

4216
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:14,660
Papa!

4217
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:17,960
Mint, you just destroyed Henya's Gatling gun!

4218
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:20,040
My Gatling gun?

4219
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:20,340
No!

4220
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:21,780
My Gatling gun?

4221
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:21,780
No!

4222
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:23,860
I had the best aim ever!

4223
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:25,940
I had the best aim ever!

4224
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:28,840
You see this pad right here, Mint?

4225
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,480
That was her Gatling gun right there.

4226
02:19:30,540 --> 02:19:30,800
You see this pad right here, Mint?

4227
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:30,800
That was her Gatling gun right there.

4228
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:31,960
Guys, I think the mission glitched.

4229
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:33,040
You know what?

4230
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:33,740
I'm fine with this.

4231
02:19:33,740 --> 02:19:37,400
Okay, uh, guys, they said the mission glitch is after somebody DCs.

4232
02:19:37,540 --> 02:19:38,500
So should we...

4233
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:40,480
So we can launch the rockets.

4234
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:42,280
We'll just wait it out.

4235
02:19:42,420 --> 02:19:43,460
How do we wait it out?

4236
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:45,140
What's gonna happen?

4237
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:46,100
Will any more bugs come?

4238
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:48,660
I think the rocket will explode.

4239
02:19:49,260 --> 02:19:49,700
Right?

4240
02:19:49,820 --> 02:19:50,540
It'll just go.

4241
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:51,640
Right?

4242
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:54,500
It says rocket launch in progress, but I don't think it's launching.

4243
02:19:55,360 --> 02:19:56,580
How do they think it's progressing?

4244
02:19:56,940 --> 02:19:58,560
It doesn't automatically.

4245
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:01,800
There's a bug breach, though.

4246
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:04,080
The rockets shoot every two minutes.

4247
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:05,640
Oh, okay.

4248
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:07,420
Okay, so maybe we should be finding...

4249
02:20:07,420 --> 02:20:07,760
What's 612?

4250
02:20:08,580 --> 02:20:09,080
Okay, yeah.

4251
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:11,020
Okay, will this kill me?

4252
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:12,660
Yeah, they're right.

4253
02:20:12,740 --> 02:20:14,700
Listen, listen, there's one on the map.

4254
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:18,220
Look, look, look, they're gonna launch it again.

4255
02:20:18,220 --> 02:20:19,280
Do you want to see what it looks like?

4256
02:20:19,380 --> 02:20:20,740
I could die in front of you.

4257
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:22,240
Oh, I saw it.

4258
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:23,160
I saw it from third person.

4259
02:20:23,260 --> 02:20:23,280
Oh, you did?

4260
02:20:23,380 --> 02:20:23,860
Good, good, good.

4261
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:27,220
Do you hear that starting up sound?

4262
02:20:28,180 --> 02:20:28,820
Yeah, yeah.

4263
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:30,040
It's about to go up.

4264
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:31,800
Where are the enemies?

4265
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:34,100
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4266
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:34,340
You know what?

4267
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:35,220
We don't need enemies.

4268
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:37,040
You know what?

4269
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:39,120
We don't need enemies when it's all of us.

4270
02:20:39,220 --> 02:20:40,260
We can just do it.

4271
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:41,720
We could be each other's enemies.

4272
02:20:42,120 --> 02:20:43,420
We could be each other's enemies.

4273
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:47,460
What the heck?

4274
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:49,180
We could be each other's enemies.

4275
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:54,980
That is so fucked up.

4276
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:55,620
Yeah.

4277
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:59,080
Oh, wait, I was resummoning them.

4278
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:02,060
Oh, no.

4279
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:03,240
Yeah.

4280
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:06,800
Only in the head.

4281
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:08,200
Only in all the wrong ways.

4282
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:10,540
Only in the head.

4283
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:10,680
Only all the wrong ways.

4284
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:13,260
Oh, but at least my suit are now clean.

4285
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:14,360
Oh, but at least my suit are now clean.

4286
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:15,100
Hello.

4287
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:16,260
Oh, thank you.

4288
02:21:16,380 --> 02:21:16,660
Hello?

4289
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:19,560
Hanya, be careful!

4290
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:22,860
That wasn't me!

4291
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:24,800
That wasn't Hanya, that was me!

4292
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:25,300
That wasn't me!

4293
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:25,300
That wasn't Hanya, that was me!

4294
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:26,660
No, I didn't do anything!

4295
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:29,260
Kata, you killed me!

4296
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:32,420
Hanya, be careful!

4297
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:33,740
What the fuck?

4298
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:42,680
Guys, I think we need to restart.

4299
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:44,000
I don't think the rocket is going off.

4300
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:45,340
I don't think so either.

4301
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:52,040
It's an honor to kill my Oshii.

4302
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:55,720
It's an honor.

4303
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:56,380
It's an honor.

4304
02:21:58,720 --> 02:21:59,700
You killed me!

4305
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:01,700
You killed me!

4306
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:01,780
Me!

4307
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:02,960
Me!

4308
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:04,280
Yeah, Mint.

4309
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,320
Why did you kill her?

4310
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:06,960
I kill everybody.

4311
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:09,160
That's really fucked up.

4312
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,940
I leave no prisoners.

4313
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:14,020
Shaking my head, Mint.

4314
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:16,580
Shaking my head, Daioh.

4315
02:22:16,820 --> 02:22:17,820
Shaking my head, Mint from Independent.

4316
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:19,740
Shaking my head, Mint.

4317
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:20,900
Mint Phantom.

4318
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:22,500
It's because we have a joke.

4319
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:25,660
It's usually, Shaking my head, Zen from Bishoujo.

4320
02:22:25,820 --> 02:22:28,040
So here it would be like, Shaking my head, Mint from Independent.

4321
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:29,840
Shaking my head.

4322
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:32,860
What I like to say is, Mint from Mint Fatome.

4323
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:34,720
Fatome.

4324
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:35,180
Fatome.

4325
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:37,300
Sounds so fancy.

4326
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:40,980
Or SMH Mint from Made Mint Channel.

4327
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:41,660
Made Mint.

4328
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:43,700
Don't!

4329
02:22:43,820 --> 02:22:44,820
That's my full name!

4330
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:46,360
Only my mom can say that.

4331
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:49,720
Made Mint Channel!

4332
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:52,000
You're supposed to do all your homework!

4333
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:52,660
No!

4334
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:54,320
I want to play Pokemon more!

4335
02:22:55,220 --> 02:22:56,540
You better do your homework!

4336
02:22:56,900 --> 02:22:57,060
No!

4337
02:22:58,700 --> 02:23:00,080
You can't make me!

4338
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:02,700
Oh, Mint!

4339
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:04,260
You're going to love this one!

4340
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:04,780
Why?

4341
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:06,280
It's my cousin.

4342
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:09,240
We're going to fight my cousin.

4343
02:23:10,140 --> 02:23:11,680
You're okay with killing your family?

4344
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:12,800
Oh yeah!

4345
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:13,860
Oh yeah!

4346
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:19,860
If it was good enough for the kings in Europe, it's good enough for me.

4347
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:21,380
Oh yeah!

4348
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:23,260
I was so excited!

4349
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:24,120
Oh yeah!

4350
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:24,800
Oh yeah!

4351
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:29,460
This is really fucked up!

4352
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:30,260
Oh yeah!

4353
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:31,860
Oh yeah!

4354
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:34,480
Why is it all farting in this planet?

4355
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:35,580
It's all farting!

4356
02:23:37,100 --> 02:23:38,280
Thank you, planet!

4357
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:38,820
Thank you!

4358
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:41,920
It's because it's the planet.

4359
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:44,220
The planet's farting!

4360
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:47,400
Yeah, the planet is making a lot of gas.

4361
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:48,860
Making shit hard for us to see.

4362
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:53,920
Smell.

4363
02:23:55,180 --> 02:23:57,060
Oh, it's not giving me a drop point.

4364
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:57,820
At all.

4365
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:58,800
That was really weird.

4366
02:23:59,940 --> 02:24:01,460
Oh, is it because of the spore towers?

4367
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:02,080
Oof.

4368
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:05,420
No, not the spore towers.

4369
02:24:05,460 --> 02:24:07,360
The spore towers can only do so much.

4370
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:08,940
It's not like letting me see anything.

4371
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,480
Can I get water real quick?

4372
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:11,300
No, that's the planet.

4373
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:12,700
It's a gas planet.

4374
02:24:12,900 --> 02:24:14,120
So that's how it's supposed to be.

4375
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:14,300
I'm ready.

4376
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:15,900
I'll be right back.

4377
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:17,700
No, no, no, you can't.

4378
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:20,500
You can't pause the game, mom.

4379
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:22,900
Just guard my body.

4380
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:24,040
No, no, no, you go ahead.

4381
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:24,680
We'll wait.

4382
02:24:24,940 --> 02:24:25,620
It's no stress.

4383
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:28,160
I gotta go do some job.

4384
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:29,320
Go, go, go!

4385
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:32,460
Well, well...

4386
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:33,300
Did Henya mute us?

4387
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:34,640
Nope.

4388
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:36,620
Mint hasn't either.

4389
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,020
Hey, everybody.

4390
02:24:38,480 --> 02:24:40,500
Do you love your oshi?

4391
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:46,840
Consider gifting five gifted subs right now to them.

4392
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:47,660
Do it.

4393
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:49,660
Show your love while they're gone.

4394
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:52,380
It's more fun to spoil them when they're not here.

4395
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:55,580
That way you can't get yelled at for spoiling them.

4396
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:58,640
Unless you like being yelled at for spoiling them, then spoil them when they're back.

4397
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:01,440
I mean, Mint likes being yelled at.

4398
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:04,260
You know who clearly doesn't love being spoiled enough?

4399
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:04,760
Haruka.

4400
02:25:04,900 --> 02:25:06,460
Because you never freaking stream.

4401
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:10,400
I literally streamed on on Sunday.

4402
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:12,400
What about before that?

4403
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:14,140
I had... Remember?

4404
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:15,560
I streamed for our new member.

4405
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:16,600
I don't remember.

4406
02:25:17,660 --> 02:25:18,180
Bukkwa!

4407
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:20,920
Liam!

4408
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:23,260
I streamed on Saturday!

4409
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:24,240
Oh, oh, wait.

4410
02:25:24,380 --> 02:25:25,480
I think I made a mistake.

4411
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:26,260
I'm getting gifted.

4412
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:29,520
Please gift to Henya and Mint and Haruka.

4413
02:25:29,660 --> 02:25:34,720
I think you should give this sub to Mantara Khan for bringing us together for this collab.

4414
02:25:34,980 --> 02:25:37,580
And she's a wonderful human being.

4415
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:39,080
And I'm so happy for her.

4416
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:39,680
I mean, I'm not a human.

4417
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:40,200
I'm a bug.

4418
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:42,840
And every Monday, this is for Mint as well, her podcast.

4419
02:25:43,020 --> 02:25:43,700
I'm pretty bad.

4420
02:25:44,120 --> 02:25:44,960
It's really cool.

4421
02:25:45,140 --> 02:25:46,460
You all should watch her podcast.

4422
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:47,400
It's so cool.

4423
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:48,380
Have you?

4424
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:51,180
Yeah, I watched the first episode.

4425
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:52,500
I gotta watch the second and third.

4426
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:54,020
And fourth, by the way.

4427
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:54,380
You're behind.

4428
02:25:54,620 --> 02:25:55,000
I know.

4429
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:55,460
I'm really behind.

4430
02:25:57,260 --> 02:25:57,340
I'm not kidding.

4431
02:25:57,460 --> 02:25:58,380
You don't have to do it.

4432
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:00,420
I like to watch my friends' shit!

4433
02:26:02,400 --> 02:26:03,140
I love you.

4434
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:05,620
You are still my friend even if you don't watch every episode.

4435
02:26:05,780 --> 02:26:07,080
Okay, I actually have to mute now.

4436
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:07,780
Damn you all!

4437
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:09,660
Now I have to mute.

4438
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:10,340
You've done it.

4439
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:11,520
You're welcome.

4440
02:26:11,740 --> 02:26:12,540
Have fun muting!

4441
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:14,840
Well, well.

4442
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:19,920
I have now successfully dominated all three channels at once.

4443
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:24,020
Mata may have me muted, but she didn't deafen me.

4444
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:27,100
So everyone can hear me.

4445
02:26:28,640 --> 02:26:29,180
Oh, yeah.

4446
02:26:29,460 --> 02:26:30,300
Hello, guys.

4447
02:26:30,380 --> 02:26:31,260
You guys having fun?

4448
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:33,900
You having a good time?

4449
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:35,580
MinceChat?

4450
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:36,480
Hi, MinceChat!

4451
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:37,440
I see you!

4452
02:26:37,740 --> 02:26:38,140
Hello!

4453
02:26:38,780 --> 02:26:39,220
Hello!

4454
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,140
Oh, she's back.

4455
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:43,060
You know how to come?

4456
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:46,040
You not streaming will not stop me.

4457
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:48,420
Um, yeah.

4458
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:51,800
You not streaming cannot stop me.

4459
02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:52,200
Welcome back!

4460
02:26:52,440 --> 02:26:53,660
Who the fuck are you?

4461
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:54,040
I'm joking.

4462
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:55,940
Your chat went crazy, Henya.

4463
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:56,580
I'm sorry.

4464
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:57,180
I don't know.

4465
02:26:57,180 --> 02:26:58,000
They always do this.

4466
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:00,000
Welcome back, Henya!

4467
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:00,920
Welcome back!

4468
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:03,720
What the heck?

4469
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:05,260
Why are there so many gifs of?

4470
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:06,220
I don't know!

4471
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:07,660
It's Haruka's fault!

4472
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:08,380
She did that!

4473
02:27:10,140 --> 02:27:10,860
It's her fault!

4474
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:13,160
Also, Haruka also has a hype frame.

4475
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:14,360
Wait, what?

4476
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:16,200
It's Haruka's fault.

4477
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:16,960
What?

4478
02:27:17,020 --> 02:27:17,540
Wait a minute.

4479
02:27:17,660 --> 02:27:17,820
What?

4480
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:19,540
I got an egg sandwich.

4481
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:19,820
I'm streaming!

4482
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:22,400
Describe taste.

4483
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:23,820
A game?

4484
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:24,700
What?

4485
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:26,720
The fuck?

4486
02:27:28,460 --> 02:27:30,220
I'm typing my own offline chat.

4487
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:31,620
Get out of here, guys!

4488
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:33,420
Go to the people who are streaming!

4489
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:35,540
Yeah, sorry.

4490
02:27:35,900 --> 02:27:37,060
Haruka said this thing.

4491
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:39,680
Haruka said spoil your Oshi by gifting five gifted.

4492
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:41,640
So that's why you probably got a lot of them.

4493
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:43,060
I'm gonna let you know right now.

4494
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:44,820
I don't say Oshi often.

4495
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:47,300
Well, she said favorite streamer.

4496
02:27:47,460 --> 02:27:49,520
She doesn't say it often, but she did that once.

4497
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:52,180
Wow, your impersonation is so bad.

4498
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:54,400
It's true.

4499
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:56,660
I hate it here.

4500
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:58,600
Do you want to eat it a bit before we start?

4501
02:27:58,880 --> 02:27:59,720
I can let you.

4502
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:00,600
I can let you finish.

4503
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:01,380
I'm generous.

4504
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:02,460
No, I'm good.

4505
02:28:03,060 --> 02:28:03,700
You sure?

4506
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:05,240
I'm good!

4507
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:07,460
Might be the only time.

4508
02:28:08,900 --> 02:28:09,920
Yeah, don't worry about it.

4509
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:11,440
Cool.

4510
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:13,460
I care about my friend.

4511
02:28:13,660 --> 02:28:15,740
For every bug I kill, I'm gonna take a bite.

4512
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:19,520
She's gonna snipe you.

4513
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:20,500
She's gonna snipe me the moment we land.

4514
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:25,360
I mean, you did every bug and you didn't specify what kind of bug.

4515
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:26,380
So you're kinda fucked.

4516
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:27,240
Yeah.

4517
02:28:29,580 --> 02:28:31,920
I like the fucking mischievous Glint.

4518
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:32,620
When he said that.

4519
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:36,160
Yeah, you're done-zo.

4520
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:38,580
You're done-zo.

4521
02:28:38,980 --> 02:28:39,900
You're done.

4522
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:41,260
Done-zo.

4523
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:43,180
Done-zo.

4524
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:45,840
Hello everyone, this is the Zentrea planet.

4525
02:28:45,960 --> 02:28:46,180
Welcome.

4526
02:28:46,180 --> 02:28:47,640
I hope you enjoy your stay.

4527
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:49,620
Oh, no wonder it's stinky though.

4528
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:52,240
She's not even here.

4529
02:28:52,820 --> 02:28:55,040
That's why we can't even see the planet.

4530
02:28:55,480 --> 02:28:55,500
That's why we can't even see the planet.

4531
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:57,020
Oh no, Zen!

4532
02:28:57,820 --> 02:29:00,820
Aw, Zen from the show, Jo.

4533
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:01,600
Aw, Zen from the show, Jo.

4534
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:02,520
Zen from Zentrea.

4535
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:05,140
Zen from Zentrea.

4536
02:29:06,260 --> 02:29:07,960
Haruka, just so you're aware.

4537
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:10,760
Things are happening in your stream even though you're not there.

4538
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:11,620
They're still happening.

4539
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:14,960
I've literally told them to fuck off to those channels.

4540
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:15,360
I've literally told them to fuck off to those channels.

4541
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:18,220
Mint, how do you feel about flying bugs?

4542
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:20,600
Oh, I like those ones.

4543
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:22,980
Do you like them if they're trying to kill you?

4544
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:24,060
Maybe.

4545
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:26,420
I've never experienced- Nice.

4546
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:28,140
Oh my god, I did that.

4547
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:30,580
I'm so proud of myself.

4548
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:32,980
What just got me?

4549
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:35,540
Was it a flying bug?

4550
02:29:35,960 --> 02:29:37,900
I don't see any bugs in the air.

4551
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:39,000
Oh, you know what it could be?

4552
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:40,060
Mint, look at the floor.

4553
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:41,160
Do you see those yellow things?

4554
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:42,940
If you step on them.

4555
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:44,160
Oh fuck.

4556
02:29:46,180 --> 02:29:46,720
What's going on?

4557
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:47,820
Sorry if I hit you.

4558
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:51,240
Sorry, not sorry.

4559
02:29:52,900 --> 02:29:54,220
Oh my god, my aim.

4560
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:55,240
Not sorry.

4561
02:29:55,660 --> 02:29:57,900
But this thing is a Charizard, right?

4562
02:29:58,060 --> 02:29:58,980
Charizard, are you?

4563
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:01,420
Do you see them flying in the air?

4564
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:02,240
Oh yeah, I do.

4565
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:02,820
I see them now.

4566
02:30:03,460 --> 02:30:05,660
We have to kill those little mushrooms.

4567
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:07,580
That is not a bug.

4568
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:08,740
That is a dinosaur.

4569
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:11,680
Actually, it's a...

4570
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:12,380
Oh, what the?

4571
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:12,780
What?

4572
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:14,520
Um...

4573
02:30:16,860 --> 02:30:17,800
I think...

4574
02:30:17,800 --> 02:30:18,560
Chris?

4575
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:19,520
Yeah?

4576
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:22,380
Do you want to talk about it?

4577
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:22,820
Oh my god.

4578
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:25,080
I think I'm dead.

4579
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:27,020
You're alive.

4580
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:27,280
You're fine.

4581
02:30:28,220 --> 02:30:29,160
It's a flesh wound.

4582
02:30:29,460 --> 02:30:30,620
I just started shooting.

4583
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:33,900
I can resurrect you, baby.

4584
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:35,420
Oh no, you've been resurrected.

4585
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:38,540
I got you.

4586
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:39,880
I'm not dead yet.

4587
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:41,500
I'm not dead yet.

4588
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:45,600
I'm dead.

4589
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:45,760
I'm dead.

4590
02:30:47,540 --> 02:30:48,580
Who was it?

4591
02:30:48,660 --> 02:30:49,400
Thank you, Mata.

4592
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:50,660
You're welcome, baby.

4593
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:51,640
I got you.

4594
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:55,140
For the birds, they're going to lean down.

4595
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,000
When they lean down, try to avoid them.

4596
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:58,120
Because that's when they damage you.

4597
02:30:58,680 --> 02:30:59,640
Wait, two of you died.

4598
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:00,080
Sorry.

4599
02:31:03,900 --> 02:31:04,980
Wake me up.

4600
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:07,460
Wake me up inside.

4601
02:31:08,100 --> 02:31:09,100
I can't wake up.

4602
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:13,960
If one of you comes back, and you have a stratagem, please use it.

4603
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:16,500
Oh my god.

4604
02:31:17,080 --> 02:31:17,320
Okay.

4605
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:19,960
These bugs are crazy.

4606
02:31:20,360 --> 02:31:21,360
I'm on fire.

4607
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:23,860
If anybody has a stratagem, please.

4608
02:31:23,940 --> 02:31:25,540
I gotta wait for a minute.

4609
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:28,880
There's three chargers, by the way.

4610
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:32,440
There's a flying one, too?

4611
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:34,320
Yeah, there's everything.

4612
02:31:34,780 --> 02:31:35,620
Oh no.

4613
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:37,820
Did I gain glitch again?

4614
02:31:38,020 --> 02:31:39,100
It said I was killed by Hanya.

4615
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:41,800
That is a crazy glitch.

4616
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:43,860
Every single time.

4617
02:31:46,340 --> 02:31:47,620
Every single time.

4618
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:50,060
This game is trying to set me up.

4619
02:31:51,100 --> 02:31:52,980
Oh my god.

4620
02:31:53,220 --> 02:31:54,400
Hanya, I think you're a murderer.

4621
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:55,620
I don't know.

4622
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:58,260
Hanya, I think you're out for blood.

4623
02:31:58,480 --> 02:31:59,780
Do you have murderistic tendencies?

4624
02:32:00,220 --> 02:32:02,500
Do you think that you want to murder?

4625
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:06,040
When you see a person, do you think, I want to kill?

4626
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:07,500
Oh yeah, she does.

4627
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:11,240
Have you not heard her go like, kill, kill, kill.

4628
02:32:11,240 --> 02:32:13,380
You might be a murderer.

4629
02:32:13,900 --> 02:32:14,740
She is.

4630
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:15,980
No, she does.

4631
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:17,020
In game, in game.

4632
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:18,940
Kill, kill, kill.

4633
02:32:21,020 --> 02:32:22,000
Where am I supposed to go?

4634
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:24,840
Oh my god.

4635
02:32:25,700 --> 02:32:27,780
I think I'm gonna get got by a laser.

4636
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:29,880
She gonna get got.

4637
02:32:29,900 --> 02:32:31,100
Sorry, that's my laser.

4638
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:32,280
That's my laser.

4639
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:35,500
Whoa, don't say that on my channel.

4640
02:32:35,660 --> 02:32:37,440
My viewers take that personally.

4641
02:32:38,060 --> 02:32:39,280
When you say my laser?

4642
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:40,700
I'm so fucking sorry.

4643
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:41,340
My laser?

4644
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:43,740
Is it like...

4645
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:45,120
I'm sorry.

4646
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:46,900
I'm so sorry.

4647
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:51,340
Is that better?

4648
02:32:51,580 --> 02:32:52,580
Yeah, so much better.

4649
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:53,060
Thank you.

4650
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:55,580
You know, thanks for understanding.

4651
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:59,180
Wait, so I can't say the other P word?

4652
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:00,640
E-N-I-S as well?

4653
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:03,220
I don't know how they feel about that one, to be honest.

4654
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:03,720
PP?

4655
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:05,180
PP!

4656
02:33:06,460 --> 02:33:06,900
PP!

4657
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:11,500
We can say PP, but we can't say penis?

4658
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:13,020
PP!

4659
02:33:13,180 --> 02:33:13,740
PP!

4660
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:15,500
Well, Haru!

4661
02:33:19,570 --> 02:33:20,770
I'm gonna get complaints.

4662
02:33:21,150 --> 02:33:22,030
I'm gonna get complaints.

4663
02:33:22,950 --> 02:33:25,490
From people being like, You're ruining Mint.

4664
02:33:26,470 --> 02:33:27,850
You've ruined her.

4665
02:33:29,210 --> 02:33:31,270
It is your fault, Haru.

4666
02:33:31,370 --> 02:33:33,510
I can't believe Haruku would say that.

4667
02:33:33,890 --> 02:33:36,110
But they're gonna somehow blame me, Haruko.

4668
02:33:36,310 --> 02:33:38,510
Haru, that's so fucked up that you...

4669
02:33:38,510 --> 02:33:40,030
I'll get blamed for this somehow.

4670
02:33:40,210 --> 02:33:40,610
I'll get blamed for this somehow.

4671
02:33:41,130 --> 02:33:42,110
We'll get blamed together.

4672
02:33:42,310 --> 02:33:45,870
I can't believe Haruka for Bishoujo cannot read the room.

4673
02:33:46,270 --> 02:33:46,910
It's unbelievable.

4674
02:33:47,290 --> 02:33:53,370
I can't believe Haruka would do this to my Mint from May Channel.

4675
02:33:54,310 --> 02:33:57,670
I can't believe Haruka would do this to her.

4676
02:33:57,790 --> 02:33:59,050
I can't believe it.

4677
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:02,590
Dora, we can get blamed together.

4678
02:34:02,750 --> 02:34:05,370
I don't know why we're blaming people.

4679
02:34:05,470 --> 02:34:06,010
What's going on?

4680
02:34:06,730 --> 02:34:07,770
I'm shooting bugs.

4681
02:34:08,970 --> 02:34:10,190
Shoot them better!

4682
02:34:11,510 --> 02:34:12,670
I'm doing it!

4683
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:13,870
We are the same.

4684
02:34:13,910 --> 02:34:17,210
I need a resupply.

4685
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:19,010
I got you.

4686
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:19,750
What?

4687
02:34:20,430 --> 02:34:21,370
How are you so fast?

4688
02:34:22,810 --> 02:34:23,850
It's coming down here.

4689
02:34:24,270 --> 02:34:25,350
Mint from toothpaste.

4690
02:34:26,370 --> 02:34:27,590
I stole that from chat.

4691
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:31,090
I love reading chat's funny words and then stealing them.

4692
02:34:31,730 --> 02:34:33,410
I'm making two girls giggle.

4693
02:34:33,950 --> 02:34:34,430
These are biotines.

4694
02:34:34,430 --> 02:34:35,430
Yeah, they're biotines.

4695
02:34:36,290 --> 02:34:37,710
Mint, I want you to see it.

4696
02:34:37,890 --> 02:34:38,230
What's that?

4697
02:34:38,890 --> 02:34:40,230
Let me try and summon him.

4698
02:34:41,510 --> 02:34:41,950
Biotines!

4699
02:34:42,130 --> 02:34:44,410
Come here, biotines!

4700
02:34:44,510 --> 02:34:46,150
I stole your joke and they laughed.

4701
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:46,810
How does it feel?

4702
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:48,050
Biotines!

4703
02:34:49,570 --> 02:34:50,450
Mr. Biotines!

4704
02:34:51,070 --> 02:34:52,370
Where art thou?

4705
02:34:52,750 --> 02:34:53,410
Where are you?

4706
02:34:53,430 --> 02:34:54,430
I'm so excited to see him.

4707
02:34:54,450 --> 02:34:55,310
Where art thou?

4708
02:34:56,490 --> 02:34:56,930
Bioliet.

4709
02:34:57,470 --> 02:34:57,910
Bioliet.

4710
02:35:00,750 --> 02:35:01,990
Oh, there he is!

4711
02:35:02,650 --> 02:35:03,710
Oh, wow!

4712
02:35:04,210 --> 02:35:05,110
Do you see him?

4713
02:35:05,230 --> 02:35:05,930
Zoom into him.

4714
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:07,430
How do I zoom in?

4715
02:35:08,150 --> 02:35:09,850
Use the little scope on your gun.

4716
02:35:10,030 --> 02:35:10,370
Oh, yeah.

4717
02:35:11,610 --> 02:35:12,750
Don't look too shy.

4718
02:35:13,870 --> 02:35:15,630
Whoa, what do I aim for?

4719
02:35:16,210 --> 02:35:17,150
Oh, hello.

4720
02:35:19,090 --> 02:35:19,610
Hello.

4721
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:20,190
Hello.

4722
02:35:20,210 --> 02:35:20,730
Hello.

4723
02:35:25,050 --> 02:35:27,050
I just like to tank it.

4724
02:35:27,650 --> 02:35:28,410
I don't...

4725
02:35:28,410 --> 02:35:30,590
I like to tank it, tank it.

4726
02:35:30,690 --> 02:35:32,350
I like to tank it.

4727
02:35:33,450 --> 02:35:34,330
I like to tank it.

4728
02:35:34,330 --> 02:35:35,750
There are so many biotines.

4729
02:35:36,010 --> 02:35:36,750
I mean, not biotines.

4730
02:35:36,810 --> 02:35:37,630
Chargers on this map.

4731
02:35:37,850 --> 02:35:38,170
I know.

4732
02:35:40,850 --> 02:35:42,770
There are so many of them.

4733
02:35:42,950 --> 02:35:43,330
There are so many of them.

4734
02:35:43,910 --> 02:35:44,490
Mags empty.

4735
02:35:45,090 --> 02:35:46,150
Mags empty.

4736
02:35:48,030 --> 02:35:48,670
Mags empty.

4737
02:35:52,110 --> 02:35:53,310
Stinky, stinky, stinky.

4738
02:35:53,910 --> 02:35:55,710
Hey, don't call me that.

4739
02:35:56,130 --> 02:35:57,830
I told you that in confidence.

4740
02:35:58,050 --> 02:35:58,790
I'm sorry.

4741
02:35:59,470 --> 02:36:00,850
I can't help, you know.

4742
02:36:01,470 --> 02:36:03,850
You know what, I wanna speak to this.

4743
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:05,650
Your stench is just really...

4744
02:36:05,650 --> 02:36:06,330
Charger.

4745
02:36:06,430 --> 02:36:07,930
Your stench, I'm sorry.

4746
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:10,070
I think you guys are smelly.

4747
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:13,010
I'm inside the butt bug.

4748
02:36:13,210 --> 02:36:15,110
I know you said that I shouldn't say it in public, but...

4749
02:36:15,110 --> 02:36:17,070
I can't hold it back anymore.

4750
02:36:17,070 --> 02:36:18,070
When did you last shower?

4751
02:36:19,510 --> 02:36:20,370
Last night.

4752
02:36:20,910 --> 02:36:21,350
Okay.

4753
02:36:22,010 --> 02:36:23,270
What about you, mother?

4754
02:36:24,230 --> 02:36:25,010
This morning.

4755
02:36:26,610 --> 02:36:27,510
I don't believe you.

4756
02:36:27,510 --> 02:36:28,150
I know, I'm sad.

4757
02:36:28,210 --> 02:36:28,990
I want it to be stinky.

4758
02:36:29,130 --> 02:36:30,150
I went for a quick run.

4759
02:36:31,370 --> 02:36:32,670
So you were stinky.

4760
02:36:33,590 --> 02:36:35,450
Yeah, and then I showered after my run.

4761
02:36:35,530 --> 02:36:37,370
Why do you have to be stinky?

4762
02:36:37,850 --> 02:36:40,410
I like when there's a little stinky, you know?

4763
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:41,150
Why?

4764
02:36:41,610 --> 02:36:42,210
I'm slowed.

4765
02:36:42,550 --> 02:36:42,990
Oh no.

4766
02:36:43,230 --> 02:36:44,350
A little stinky is good.

4767
02:36:44,390 --> 02:36:46,730
Sometimes when you're slowed and you took damage, you can stim yourself.

4768
02:36:46,890 --> 02:36:47,490
Oh, you can?

4769
02:36:47,950 --> 02:36:49,610
It's a little boost of speed.

4770
02:36:49,810 --> 02:36:52,370
It saves you from the snare or whatever it is.

4771
02:36:52,370 --> 02:36:52,450
Oh, okay.

4772
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,060
Also, next time I'm next to you, I can give you a shield.

4773
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:01,000
If you want.

4774
02:37:01,900 --> 02:37:02,640
If you want.

4775
02:37:02,660 --> 02:37:03,860
But only if you want it.

4776
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:06,620
It's not like you want it or anything.

4777
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:07,520
I don't want your stinky shield or anything.

4778
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:08,880
Fine.

4779
02:37:11,720 --> 02:37:12,380
You know what?

4780
02:37:12,440 --> 02:37:12,800
Fine.

4781
02:37:13,980 --> 02:37:15,580
You don't deserve my big shield.

4782
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:15,900
Yeah.

4783
02:37:16,380 --> 02:37:19,800
What is up with you and referencing Gyo and Yokio?

4784
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:22,600
I think I'm going to watch that for the Patreon.

4785
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:26,820
You've been referencing it like crazy recently.

4786
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:28,720
I'm only referencing that one sentence.

4787
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:31,660
Because I need to rewatch it to reference the other one.

4788
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:33,640
What were you referencing?

4789
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:34,620
Gyo and Yokio.

4790
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:36,900
Gido, anime...

4791
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:38,540
Huang Junxin...

4792
02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:42,800
I'm dead.

4793
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:44,860
I'm down...

4794
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:45,760
I'm deee....

4795
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:46,920
DIE!

4796
02:37:51,880 --> 02:37:55,520
Oh yeah, she's never coming back to life.

4797
02:38:01,460 --> 02:38:02,300
That's so smart.

4798
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:03,400
It's just like an ACR.

4799
02:38:08,230 --> 02:38:11,170
Oh my god.

4800
02:38:13,180 --> 02:38:15,020
We have a lot of chargers here.

4801
02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:17,500
This is... this seems like now you're in the thick of it.

4802
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:19,760
Yeah, there's so many of them.

4803
02:38:20,060 --> 02:38:22,440
You basically have to stick with it.

4804
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:23,240
Oh my god.

4805
02:38:23,440 --> 02:38:23,680
Oh.

4806
02:38:23,780 --> 02:38:24,460
I was...

4807
02:38:24,460 --> 02:38:24,980
In the thick of it!

4808
02:38:25,220 --> 02:38:26,260
In the thick of it!

4809
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:27,620
Yeah!

4810
02:38:27,780 --> 02:38:29,060
You know what I'm referencing!

4811
02:38:29,960 --> 02:38:31,240
I died again.

4812
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:32,040
I'm so sorry.

4813
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:32,740
I got you.

4814
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:33,000
I got you.

4815
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:33,920
I'm already summoning you back.

4816
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:36,580
Oh my god, man.

4817
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:38,180
Oh, I broke the rock.

4818
02:38:38,340 --> 02:38:40,700
Wasn't that a meme, like, long ago?

4819
02:38:40,840 --> 02:38:41,980
It was on the TikToks.

4820
02:38:41,980 --> 02:38:42,820
It was a while ago.

4821
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:43,200
Yeah.

4822
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:43,640
Okay, guys.

4823
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:45,320
I think we need to get out of here.

4824
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:47,620
It's all chargers.

4825
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:48,560
There's like three of them.

4826
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:50,500
I think we just have to run to the next Vile Titan.

4827
02:38:51,380 --> 02:38:52,240
M3, come with me.

4828
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:53,100
What?

4829
02:38:53,260 --> 02:38:53,900
Oh, did I see you?

4830
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:55,320
Yeah, just run.

4831
02:38:55,380 --> 02:38:57,100
Just like keep running away from here.

4832
02:38:57,160 --> 02:38:57,400
Oh no.

4833
02:38:57,840 --> 02:38:59,020
I'm getting the run out.

4834
02:38:59,040 --> 02:38:59,360
No!

4835
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:00,480
Yeah, yeah.

4836
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:01,100
I'm trying.

4837
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:01,620
I'm doing that.

4838
02:39:02,740 --> 02:39:03,180
Oh, wait.

4839
02:39:03,180 --> 02:39:03,900
So actually, you know what?

4840
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:04,260
No, no, no.

4841
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:04,700
Stay there.

4842
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:05,380
I'll revive you.

4843
02:39:05,700 --> 02:39:06,480
Why did you kill me, Matara?

4844
02:39:06,740 --> 02:39:07,680
Why did you kill me?

4845
02:39:07,800 --> 02:39:10,500
Because I'll just revive you in the next spot.

4846
02:39:10,860 --> 02:39:11,580
No way.

4847
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:12,720
Away from there.

4848
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:14,440
Matara!

4849
02:39:14,440 --> 02:39:16,340
Matara, reinforce with me now!

4850
02:39:17,540 --> 02:39:18,920
Reinforce me right now!

4851
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:19,640
This is safer.

4852
02:39:19,640 --> 02:39:21,680
You reinforced to call in dead teammates.

4853
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:22,960
This is safer this way.

4854
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:23,480
Trust me.

4855
02:39:24,140 --> 02:39:25,180
Source, trust me.

4856
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:28,300
See, I'm carrying you in my pocket like a Pokemon.

4857
02:39:29,640 --> 02:39:31,720
I'm carrying you in my pocket like a little Pokemon.

4858
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:32,700
Trust me.

4859
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:35,400
I don't want to be... I was caught illegally.

4860
02:39:35,700 --> 02:39:38,980
I was like... I was... I was taken against my will.

4861
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:40,400
No!

4862
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:43,300
Oh, no.

4863
02:39:43,400 --> 02:39:44,100
I'm in the water.

4864
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:44,640
I'm in the water.

4865
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:45,700
She used a Master Ball.

4866
02:39:45,780 --> 02:39:46,560
I didn't even have a choice.

4867
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:49,000
I am drowning under the water.

4868
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:52,380
You can't die.

4869
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:53,420
You have to res me.

4870
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:55,840
Oh, she already res you, didn't she?

4871
02:39:55,980 --> 02:39:57,680
No, I'm still not res.

4872
02:40:00,460 --> 02:40:01,340
Please, boy.

4873
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:05,540
I was waiting for it to be safer.

4874
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:08,900
I thought they resummoned you.

4875
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:13,380
Be careful.

4876
02:40:13,460 --> 02:40:14,440
They will be coming soon.

4877
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:15,480
Nice!

4878
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:18,600
Oh, there they are.

4879
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:21,940
Wait, so...

4880
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:25,520
Here we go.

4881
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:27,000
Yeah, there's a lot of bugs here.

4882
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:27,780
We need... Oh, shit.

4883
02:40:27,820 --> 02:40:28,400
Oh, good one.

4884
02:40:29,940 --> 02:40:31,320
Oh, shit.

4885
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:31,320
Oh, good one.

4886
02:40:31,340 --> 02:40:34,940
But, Tara from Fishojo, did you kill a maid ...

4887
02:40:34,940 --> 02:40:38,220
No, she launched the rocket onto herself.

4888
02:40:38,740 --> 02:40:39,780
Oh my ...

4889
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:40,980
How did you see this shit?

4890
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,000
I did it!

4891
02:40:43,020 --> 02:40:45,520
Why did our own friend from our own agency...

4892
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:46,720
Mint, run from the laser.

4893
02:40:47,900 --> 02:40:48,780
...tell me.

4894
02:40:49,100 --> 02:40:50,620
Run from the laser.

4895
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:52,660
I don't know what the laser is, but I'm running.

4896
02:40:52,780 --> 02:40:54,000
You can see it.

4897
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:55,260
If you look back, you'll see it.

4898
02:40:55,280 --> 02:40:55,700
You'll know.

4899
02:40:58,460 --> 02:41:00,340
Wait, can you guys use the Command...

4900
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:06,440
I can't use it.

4901
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:08,580
Maybe it's on cooldown?

4902
02:41:09,700 --> 02:41:11,600
No, I can't even see them.

4903
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:13,640
Oh my god.

4904
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:21,780
Why are there so many bugs on this map compared to the other ones?

4905
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:23,560
Did I accidentally put a... I don't think I have a clue.

4906
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:25,840
We are on hard mode or what is going on?

4907
02:41:26,220 --> 02:41:28,640
We were on 5 for the last 3 missions.

4908
02:41:30,340 --> 02:41:30,860
I saw that.

4909
02:41:31,720 --> 02:41:34,500
Min, just keep running.

4910
02:41:34,980 --> 02:41:35,860
Okay, I'm running.

4911
02:41:36,680 --> 02:41:38,000
I'm gonna run towards everybody.

4912
02:41:38,280 --> 02:41:39,320
Oh no, he's catching up to me.

4913
02:41:39,320 --> 02:41:39,960
Run towards him.

4914
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:44,320
When he comes at you, you can jump to the side when he's real close to you.

4915
02:41:44,620 --> 02:41:46,320
When you're running, try to look back a bit.

4916
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:50,700
You can outrun most bugs.

4917
02:41:51,100 --> 02:41:51,380
You can?

4918
02:41:52,140 --> 02:41:53,480
Yeah, except the little white ones.

4919
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:56,560
If they're in a group, you usually should have to turn around to kill the little white ones.

4920
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:57,000
Oh god, just run.

4921
02:41:57,620 --> 02:41:58,500
Yeah, just run.

4922
02:41:58,640 --> 02:41:59,480
You're doing great.

4923
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:02,220
Oh boy.

4924
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:02,660
Oh gosh.

4925
02:42:02,740 --> 02:42:02,940
Oh boy.

4926
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:04,480
Just run towards them.

4927
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:06,180
And they'll be able to assist us.

4928
02:42:06,180 --> 02:42:08,420
Wow, I still jumped out of his way, but he...

4929
02:42:08,420 --> 02:42:09,340
I got you.

4930
02:42:09,400 --> 02:42:09,560
I got you.

4931
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:10,980
Thank you.

4932
02:42:11,020 --> 02:42:11,420
Thank you.

4933
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:12,140
I'm running.

4934
02:42:12,220 --> 02:42:12,540
I'm running.

4935
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:13,040
I'm running.

4936
02:42:13,160 --> 02:42:13,760
Oh, he's right...

4937
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:14,840
You're gonna be able to assist us.

4938
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:15,620
Friendship door here.

4939
02:42:15,860 --> 02:42:17,020
Oh, there's a guy in front.

4940
02:42:17,240 --> 02:42:17,460
Nice.

4941
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:18,920
There's a guy in front.

4942
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:19,320
Nice.

4943
02:42:19,580 --> 02:42:20,860
Okay, there's a guy behind too.

4944
02:42:22,220 --> 02:42:22,760
Careful, Min.

4945
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:23,520
There's a guy behind you.

4946
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:23,840
Yeah.

4947
02:42:24,100 --> 02:42:24,460
Oh.

4948
02:42:24,820 --> 02:42:25,180
What?

4949
02:42:27,820 --> 02:42:28,200
Okay.

4950
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:29,340
Woo!

4951
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:32,740
See, like sometimes it's easy and then you get into a difficulty and you're like, oh my god.

4952
02:42:32,940 --> 02:42:34,140
Oh my god, indeed.

4953
02:42:35,020 --> 02:42:35,400
Okay.

4954
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:36,720
That blew up, yes.

4955
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:37,300
Okay.

4956
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:38,260
Now for the other ones.

4957
02:42:38,280 --> 02:42:38,500
Okay.

4958
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:40,820
These little white ones that you usually cannot run.

4959
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:42,020
Oh, they're fast?

4960
02:42:42,140 --> 02:42:42,280
Yeah.

4961
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:44,820
If they're in a group, yeah, they'll jump on you and stagger you.

4962
02:42:45,640 --> 02:42:46,240
Oh shoot.

4963
02:42:46,820 --> 02:42:49,000
But the rest of them, you can outrun them.

4964
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:51,880
Oh my god, reloading is gonna kill me.

4965
02:42:55,410 --> 02:42:57,170
I just like to take a breathe.

4966
02:42:57,210 --> 02:42:57,310
Oh my god.

4967
02:42:57,310 --> 02:42:57,970
Freedom.

4968
02:42:57,970 --> 02:42:59,750
They taste like mint, I think.

4969
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:01,090
What?

4970
02:43:01,150 --> 02:43:01,950
Freedom tastes like mint?

4971
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:03,070
Yeah.

4972
02:43:03,910 --> 02:43:04,770
And toothpaste.

4973
02:43:06,270 --> 02:43:07,230
To the best!

4974
02:43:08,590 --> 02:43:09,110
For prosperity!

4975
02:43:09,110 --> 02:43:10,290
For prosperity!

4976
02:43:10,850 --> 02:43:11,330
Uh-oh.

4977
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:16,350
Prosperity awaits in the care of magnets.

4978
02:43:17,990 --> 02:43:18,510
Honestly.

4979
02:43:18,510 --> 02:43:19,210
What the?

4980
02:43:19,350 --> 02:43:20,950
Did you not read the company policy?

4981
02:43:21,030 --> 02:43:21,950
Thank you, Daniel!

4982
02:43:22,190 --> 02:43:22,750
I didn't know!

4983
02:43:22,790 --> 02:43:24,790
Now wave as you stay in autonomy.

4984
02:43:24,790 --> 02:43:28,870
I just threw something and I'm not sure what.

4985
02:43:29,250 --> 02:43:30,610
Don't worry, Hany, I got you back.

4986
02:43:31,150 --> 02:43:31,510
Sorry.

4987
02:43:31,810 --> 02:43:33,410
I think I know what you just threw.

4988
02:43:33,550 --> 02:43:34,370
I don't think that was me.

4989
02:43:35,170 --> 02:43:35,750
Uh-huh.

4990
02:43:35,930 --> 02:43:36,710
I don't think so.

4991
02:43:37,130 --> 02:43:37,670
Hold on.

4992
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:38,230
Samples.

4993
02:43:38,830 --> 02:43:39,190
Samples.

4994
02:43:40,070 --> 02:43:40,430
Democracy.

4995
02:43:41,230 --> 02:43:41,570
Let's go.

4996
02:43:42,310 --> 02:43:42,670
Nice!

4997
02:43:42,710 --> 02:43:44,030
Do you have, um...

4998
02:43:44,030 --> 02:43:45,030
Oh, I'll just use this gun.

4999
02:43:45,570 --> 02:43:46,190
Let's do more.

5000
02:43:51,430 --> 02:43:53,170
Should we go towards them?

5001
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:54,490
Yeah, go towards them.

5002
02:43:54,510 --> 02:43:54,770
I'm just gonna...

5003
02:43:54,790 --> 02:43:56,150
I'm just gonna kill this guy so he doesn't follow us.

5004
02:43:56,250 --> 02:43:56,610
Oh!

5005
02:43:56,830 --> 02:43:57,430
Oh, okay.

5006
02:43:57,510 --> 02:43:58,270
I got this set.

5007
02:43:58,310 --> 02:43:58,730
I'm running.

5008
02:43:59,030 --> 02:43:59,390
Oh, wait.

5009
02:43:59,410 --> 02:43:59,750
Hold on.

5010
02:44:00,470 --> 02:44:01,490
I'll let you know when it beeps.

5011
02:44:01,530 --> 02:44:01,650
Yes!

5012
02:44:01,650 --> 02:44:02,290
I'm running.

5013
02:44:02,810 --> 02:44:03,170
Okay.

5014
02:44:04,190 --> 02:44:05,030
Running, running.

5015
02:44:05,150 --> 02:44:05,830
Oh, careful.

5016
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:07,330
Men to your left are bugs.

5017
02:44:07,510 --> 02:44:07,710
Stop!

5018
02:44:09,690 --> 02:44:10,330
Is that good?

5019
02:44:10,650 --> 02:44:13,250
Yeah, if you heard the beep sound, it means that it's in line.

5020
02:44:13,390 --> 02:44:14,590
Maybe they're at your other left?

5021
02:44:14,810 --> 02:44:15,010
Yeah.

5022
02:44:15,590 --> 02:44:16,630
I'm killing some.

5023
02:44:16,630 --> 02:44:17,430
Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.

5024
02:44:18,730 --> 02:44:19,090
Stop!

5025
02:44:19,250 --> 02:44:19,530
Okay.

5026
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:21,470
Yeah, so if you hear the beep...

5027
02:44:21,470 --> 02:44:25,030
Yeah, getting a lot of chargers is hard when you don't have, like, the items to kill them.

5028
02:44:25,030 --> 02:44:29,110
So, Hany, there's, like, a distinct beep sound coming from the terminal that lets you know that, um, you aligned it perfectly.

5029
02:44:29,630 --> 02:44:30,290
Oh, really?

5030
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:33,770
Yeah, so that's why sometimes it's easy to do this on your own if you can.

5031
02:44:33,870 --> 02:44:34,670
Here they come.

5032
02:44:34,790 --> 02:44:35,130
Oh!

5033
02:44:35,130 --> 02:44:35,550
I see.

5034
02:44:35,570 --> 02:44:35,910
Thank you.

5035
02:44:35,990 --> 02:44:36,350
Oh, I see.

5036
02:44:36,350 --> 02:44:36,650
Oh, yeah.

5037
02:44:36,650 --> 02:44:36,750
How's that?

5038
02:44:36,990 --> 02:44:37,350
Refill.

5039
02:44:38,970 --> 02:44:39,570
That's empty.

5040
02:44:39,730 --> 02:44:39,970
Yeah!

5041
02:44:40,650 --> 02:44:41,330
All right, girls.

5042
02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:42,950
I will awaken...

5043
02:44:43,710 --> 02:44:44,330
The beast?

5044
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:45,690
The beast within.

5045
02:44:46,470 --> 02:44:47,690
The beast within.

5046
02:44:51,650 --> 02:44:53,270
I will awaken the beast within.

5047
02:44:54,070 --> 02:44:55,770
Are you gonna wake a state... or a bomb?

5048
02:44:55,810 --> 02:44:56,250
Oh, my God.

5049
02:44:56,910 --> 02:44:59,610
I don't have a laser, but I'm gonna do what I can.

5050
02:44:59,830 --> 02:45:00,430
Oh, my God.

5051
02:45:00,450 --> 02:45:01,650
Don't tell me that I'm gonna miss him.

5052
02:45:01,870 --> 02:45:02,710
Okay, it still hit him.

5053
02:45:02,770 --> 02:45:03,170
Thank God.

5054
02:45:04,290 --> 02:45:05,430
I'm in my own world, you guys.

5055
02:45:05,550 --> 02:45:05,670
Oh, shit.

5056
02:45:05,690 --> 02:45:06,550
Oh, that's him again.

5057
02:45:07,290 --> 02:45:07,930
Uh-oh.

5058
02:45:08,350 --> 02:45:09,470
Oh, he's throwing up!

5059
02:45:10,410 --> 02:45:11,610
We're in the middle of two...

5060
02:45:11,610 --> 02:45:13,430
We're in the middle of two bug breaches.

5061
02:45:13,790 --> 02:45:14,370
Uh-oh.

5062
02:45:14,950 --> 02:45:15,270
Yeah.

5063
02:45:15,370 --> 02:45:15,670
Oh, shit.

5064
02:45:15,670 --> 02:45:16,270
Oh, shit.

5065
02:45:16,270 --> 02:45:17,330
So we gotta go back towards them?

5066
02:45:17,430 --> 02:45:18,330
Or yeah, you're towards them.

5067
02:45:18,350 --> 02:45:18,510
Perfect.

5068
02:45:18,770 --> 02:45:20,330
I was in the middle of two bug breaches.

5069
02:45:20,510 --> 02:45:21,530
Nick was doing great.

5070
02:45:23,150 --> 02:45:23,550
No!

5071
02:45:24,870 --> 02:45:25,650
I got you, Hanya.

5072
02:45:26,390 --> 02:45:27,190
I got you.

5073
02:45:28,750 --> 02:45:29,970
No, I got her.

5074
02:45:30,090 --> 02:45:30,770
I got her.

5075
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:31,350
Throw.

5076
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:32,330
I got her.

5077
02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:33,830
Oh, God.

5078
02:45:33,970 --> 02:45:34,730
I'm sorry.

5079
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:36,590
I put you in a pretty bad spot.

5080
02:45:37,350 --> 02:45:37,910
I'm okay.

5081
02:45:39,190 --> 02:45:40,530
My dad didn't kill me.

5082
02:45:41,590 --> 02:45:42,930
I almost had him killed.

5083
02:45:43,010 --> 02:45:45,350
I just needed to do one more Kusar cannon and he's dead.

5084
02:45:45,470 --> 02:45:45,650
Yeah.

5085
02:45:45,670 --> 02:45:46,670
I need ammo.

5086
02:45:48,910 --> 02:45:49,370
There we go.

5087
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,670
Good job.

5088
02:45:50,950 --> 02:45:51,750
Beautifully done.

5089
02:45:52,650 --> 02:45:55,670
I don't think I shot out of my Haruka from Bishoujo.

5090
02:45:56,430 --> 02:45:57,590
That's my gamer girl.

5091
02:45:58,290 --> 02:45:59,390
That's my Canadian moose.

5092
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:03,790
That's my girl.

5093
02:46:04,350 --> 02:46:04,810
What?

5094
02:46:04,870 --> 02:46:05,510
You're gonna burn me?

5095
02:46:06,230 --> 02:46:08,510
Run, run, run.

5096
02:46:08,730 --> 02:46:11,970
I will burn myself to a crisp.

5097
02:46:12,090 --> 02:46:12,430
Thank you.

5098
02:46:12,510 --> 02:46:13,790
Oh, my God.

5099
02:46:13,970 --> 02:46:14,870
Oh, my God.

5100
02:46:14,890 --> 02:46:15,470
I got you.

5101
02:46:15,570 --> 02:46:15,650
Oh, my God.

5102
02:46:15,790 --> 02:46:16,450
Thank you.

5103
02:46:16,470 --> 02:46:17,270
Thank you.

5104
02:46:17,730 --> 02:46:18,090
Nice.

5105
02:46:18,690 --> 02:46:19,050
Oh.

5106
02:46:19,150 --> 02:46:19,550
Never mind.

5107
02:46:20,030 --> 02:46:20,770
I fucking suck.

5108
02:46:20,770 --> 02:46:21,890
You can go back and pull back.

5109
02:46:27,310 --> 02:46:28,010
Being in the sand.

5110
02:46:28,010 --> 02:46:28,550
Oh, he's dead now.

5111
02:46:29,110 --> 02:46:29,630
You know what?

5112
02:46:29,670 --> 02:46:30,750
I can still see the control.

5113
02:46:31,050 --> 02:46:31,930
God dang it.

5114
02:46:32,270 --> 02:46:33,310
You still can't see the...

5115
02:46:33,310 --> 02:46:33,410
Oh.

5116
02:46:33,630 --> 02:46:34,650
I've done that before.

5117
02:46:34,730 --> 02:46:35,030
Wait.

5118
02:46:35,650 --> 02:46:36,170
Oh, really?

5119
02:46:36,970 --> 02:46:37,330
Yeah.

5120
02:46:37,430 --> 02:46:39,090
I don't know how I turned it back.

5121
02:46:40,390 --> 02:46:41,550
Is anybody in your chat?

5122
02:46:41,650 --> 02:46:42,830
I feel like they have to see it.

5123
02:46:42,850 --> 02:46:43,730
I know I've done that before.

5124
02:46:43,790 --> 02:46:44,950
I know the bug you're talking about.

5125
02:46:45,170 --> 02:46:45,590
I need that too.

5126
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:47,110
I think it's usually when you have your map open.

5127
02:46:47,330 --> 02:46:47,690
Oh, my God.

5128
02:46:48,310 --> 02:46:50,310
When you have your map open, you like can't...

5129
02:46:50,730 --> 02:46:51,050
Yeah.

5130
02:46:51,090 --> 02:46:52,010
Press tab again.

5131
02:46:53,710 --> 02:46:54,490
Oh, I did.

5132
02:46:54,650 --> 02:46:55,570
But it still doesn't work.

5133
02:46:55,670 --> 02:46:55,750
Don't do that.

5134
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:55,950
Don't do that.

5135
02:46:56,970 --> 02:46:57,610
Oh, shit.

5136
02:46:58,090 --> 02:46:58,410
Man.

5137
02:46:59,050 --> 02:46:59,370
What?

5138
02:46:59,470 --> 02:47:00,890
Why didn't you tell me you were so...

5139
02:47:00,890 --> 02:47:02,490
Maybe if I finish the mission, it'll be fine.

5140
02:47:04,250 --> 02:47:05,250
Why do you need to know?

5141
02:47:05,890 --> 02:47:06,390
It's my fault.

5142
02:47:06,390 --> 02:47:07,010
So, what are you trying to do?

5143
02:47:07,130 --> 02:47:08,750
Are you trying to open up your stratagem, Senya?

5144
02:47:09,030 --> 02:47:09,350
Huh?

5145
02:47:09,810 --> 02:47:11,090
If I walked into it, it was going to kill me.

5146
02:47:11,090 --> 02:47:11,810
So, what are you trying to do?

5147
02:47:11,850 --> 02:47:12,770
I'm looking at your stream now.

5148
02:47:12,850 --> 02:47:13,350
Are you trying to open your...

5149
02:47:13,350 --> 02:47:13,690
Pay attention.

5150
02:47:13,950 --> 02:47:14,310
Oh, I'm trying to...

5151
02:47:14,310 --> 02:47:15,690
I'm pressing the control right now.

5152
02:47:15,690 --> 02:47:16,990
But it doesn't see like...

5153
02:47:16,990 --> 02:47:19,030
Usually, they show me the like a stuff, right?

5154
02:47:19,090 --> 02:47:19,690
The arrow stuff.

5155
02:47:19,890 --> 02:47:20,890
But I can't see it.

5156
02:47:21,370 --> 02:47:21,690
Hmm.

5157
02:47:22,110 --> 02:47:22,430
Rare...

5158
02:47:22,430 --> 02:47:22,790
Oh.

5159
02:47:23,430 --> 02:47:23,770
Oh, no.

5160
02:47:23,770 --> 02:47:24,030
Let's eat.

5161
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:25,030
I'm going to turn around.

5162
02:47:25,030 --> 02:47:25,270
That is weird.

5163
02:47:25,310 --> 02:47:25,930
I think that's okay.

5164
02:47:25,990 --> 02:47:26,090
No.

5165
02:47:26,190 --> 02:47:26,610
We got him.

5166
02:47:26,650 --> 02:47:26,930
We got him.

5167
02:47:27,530 --> 02:47:27,850
Okay.

5168
02:47:28,530 --> 02:47:30,970
If you can see the bait, I can get him with this gun.

5169
02:47:31,150 --> 02:47:32,590
If I am the bait, you said?

5170
02:47:32,690 --> 02:47:32,910
Yeah.

5171
02:47:33,230 --> 02:47:33,550
Okay.

5172
02:47:34,050 --> 02:47:34,770
I'm good at that.

5173
02:47:34,830 --> 02:47:36,390
I think you'll be fine if we leave this mission, maybe?

5174
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:37,190
Yeah.

5175
02:47:37,210 --> 02:47:37,370
Yeah.

5176
02:47:37,730 --> 02:47:38,530
I think that's it.

5177
02:47:38,590 --> 02:47:38,770
See?

5178
02:47:38,770 --> 02:47:38,950
He's dead.

5179
02:47:39,030 --> 02:47:40,270
Maybe just in this mission.

5180
02:47:40,330 --> 02:47:40,670
Oh, nice.

5181
02:47:40,890 --> 02:47:41,430
Good job.

5182
02:47:41,430 --> 02:47:42,570
I didn't do anything.

5183
02:47:42,770 --> 02:47:43,210
You're the bait.

5184
02:47:43,290 --> 02:47:43,870
I know.

5185
02:47:43,870 --> 02:47:44,090
I know.

5186
02:47:44,090 --> 02:47:45,030
But you still helped.

5187
02:47:45,070 --> 02:47:45,650
You were the bait.

5188
02:47:45,810 --> 02:47:46,230
I'm going to survive.

5189
02:47:46,310 --> 02:47:47,850
You had a very important job.

5190
02:47:48,090 --> 02:47:48,710
That's true.

5191
02:47:48,830 --> 02:47:49,030
You were the bait.

5192
02:47:49,830 --> 02:47:50,690
I was delicious.

5193
02:47:50,930 --> 02:47:51,770
Minty freshness.

5194
02:47:52,390 --> 02:47:53,070
Over here.

5195
02:47:53,290 --> 02:47:54,270
You want a little bite of a...

5196
02:47:54,270 --> 02:47:54,530
Oh, gee.

5197
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:55,110
You mind?

5198
02:47:55,170 --> 02:47:55,790
Maybe that'll work.

5199
02:47:55,870 --> 02:47:56,310
Minty girl.

5200
02:47:56,310 --> 02:47:56,970
A little bite of a what?

5201
02:47:57,310 --> 02:47:57,990
Minty girl.

5202
02:47:58,610 --> 02:48:00,330
Hey there, big bug.

5203
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:02,690
You want a little bite?

5204
02:48:03,590 --> 02:48:04,190
What's this?

5205
02:48:04,890 --> 02:48:05,790
Can I open it?

5206
02:48:06,850 --> 02:48:07,630
There's a chair.

5207
02:48:08,370 --> 02:48:09,330
Anyone want to sit?

5208
02:48:09,890 --> 02:48:10,650
You can try.

5209
02:48:10,750 --> 02:48:11,110
Okay.

5210
02:48:11,270 --> 02:48:11,410
Okay.

5211
02:48:11,950 --> 02:48:12,850
I got you.

5212
02:48:12,950 --> 02:48:13,630
It ain't working.

5213
02:48:13,730 --> 02:48:14,430
It ain't working.

5214
02:48:14,590 --> 02:48:15,030
I'm trying.

5215
02:48:15,670 --> 02:48:16,190
Oh.

5216
02:48:16,310 --> 02:48:17,030
She did it.

5217
02:48:17,050 --> 02:48:17,870
She fixed your problem.

5218
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:19,630
I love her.

5219
02:48:19,890 --> 02:48:20,870
I probably should reload.

5220
02:48:22,330 --> 02:48:22,850
And...

5221
02:48:24,310 --> 02:48:25,130
What?

5222
02:48:25,830 --> 02:48:27,170
Are you going to kill us, Mint?

5223
02:48:27,590 --> 02:48:29,670
I'm talking to the little guys.

5224
02:48:30,010 --> 02:48:30,530
Wait.

5225
02:48:30,650 --> 02:48:34,090
I thought we fought over this democracy thing all along.

5226
02:48:34,190 --> 02:48:36,090
I'm killing the little guys.

5227
02:48:36,090 --> 02:48:37,330
I don't want to...

5228
02:48:37,330 --> 02:48:40,010
If you're a little guy, run.

5229
02:48:40,210 --> 02:48:42,870
Run because you are in trouble right now.

5230
02:48:42,890 --> 02:48:44,210
Uh-oh.

5231
02:48:44,210 --> 02:48:45,210
She will kill you.

5232
02:48:45,690 --> 02:48:46,130
Oh.

5233
02:48:46,190 --> 02:48:46,630
Oh.

5234
02:48:46,770 --> 02:48:47,210
Yeah.

5235
02:48:47,270 --> 02:48:48,730
Let my red thing go and then...

5236
02:48:48,730 --> 02:48:48,890
Oh.

5237
02:48:50,150 --> 02:48:50,590
Sorry.

5238
02:48:51,290 --> 02:48:51,730
Matara.

5239
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:52,150
Um.

5240
02:48:52,250 --> 02:48:55,710
Why did you not tell me that you were launching some missiles?

5241
02:48:55,950 --> 02:48:56,390
Matara.

5242
02:48:56,510 --> 02:48:57,050
I died.

5243
02:48:57,070 --> 02:48:57,510
Honestly.

5244
02:48:57,830 --> 02:48:59,870
To be completely honest with you, it's my fault.

5245
02:48:59,950 --> 02:49:02,230
I just thought you saw the big red thing in front of you.

5246
02:49:02,250 --> 02:49:02,590
My bad.

5247
02:49:03,090 --> 02:49:03,530
Matara.

5248
02:49:03,650 --> 02:49:07,870
You really overestimated how good my vision is.

5249
02:49:07,870 --> 02:49:08,050
Okay?

5250
02:49:08,110 --> 02:49:08,650
You're right.

5251
02:49:09,490 --> 02:49:11,110
I too am blind and old.

5252
02:49:12,430 --> 02:49:12,870
You're right.

5253
02:49:12,870 --> 02:49:14,030
Well, you're not old, but you're blind.

5254
02:49:14,230 --> 02:49:15,350
Definitely the blind part.

5255
02:49:15,590 --> 02:49:15,710
Yeah.

5256
02:49:17,570 --> 02:49:18,010
All

5257
02:49:24,470 --> 02:49:24,630
right.

5258
02:49:24,650 --> 02:49:25,330
I'm coming in.

5259
02:49:25,370 --> 02:49:25,870
I'm coming in.

5260
02:49:27,030 --> 02:49:27,470
I

5261
02:49:31,330 --> 02:49:31,810
guess so.

5262
02:49:33,650 --> 02:49:35,470
It was so like matter of fact.

5263
02:49:35,490 --> 02:49:36,030
Like, yup.

5264
02:49:36,090 --> 02:49:36,590
That's it.

5265
02:49:37,170 --> 02:49:37,610
That's it.

5266
02:49:37,690 --> 02:49:38,030
That's it?

5267
02:49:38,030 --> 02:49:38,270
Yeah.

5268
02:49:39,190 --> 02:49:39,870
We're just...

5269
02:49:39,870 --> 02:49:40,530
Yup.

5270
02:49:40,850 --> 02:49:42,410
We're gaming, Haruka.

5271
02:49:42,450 --> 02:49:43,050
We're gaming.

5272
02:49:44,330 --> 02:49:44,990
We are.

5273
02:49:45,270 --> 02:49:45,830
We can't...

5274
02:49:45,830 --> 02:49:47,230
Minch, have you been to Little Seas?

5275
02:49:47,230 --> 02:49:48,130
We're gaming right now.

5276
02:49:48,150 --> 02:49:49,150
We were talking about that earlier.

5277
02:49:49,150 --> 02:49:49,370
Yeah.

5278
02:49:49,390 --> 02:49:49,850
I have been to...

5279
02:49:49,850 --> 02:49:50,410
I used to...

5280
02:49:50,410 --> 02:49:50,590
Yeah.

5281
02:49:50,690 --> 02:49:50,870
Yeah.

5282
02:49:51,050 --> 02:49:51,490
I...

5283
02:49:51,490 --> 02:49:52,470
You used to what?

5284
02:49:52,730 --> 02:49:53,170
No.

5285
02:49:53,170 --> 02:49:53,370
Nothing.

5286
02:49:54,150 --> 02:49:54,870
Oh, okay.

5287
02:49:54,930 --> 02:49:55,090
Okay.

5288
02:49:55,090 --> 02:49:55,310
Never mind.

5289
02:49:55,410 --> 02:49:55,630
Oh.

5290
02:49:57,330 --> 02:49:58,190
Well, I would...

5291
02:49:58,190 --> 02:49:59,690
So, I would go with friends.

5292
02:50:00,290 --> 02:50:00,950
Uh-huh.

5293
02:50:01,410 --> 02:50:01,850
But...

5294
02:50:02,690 --> 02:50:03,130
Okay.

5295
02:50:03,250 --> 02:50:04,030
She's bragging.

5296
02:50:04,030 --> 02:50:04,810
She has friends.

5297
02:50:04,890 --> 02:50:04,990
Yeah.

5298
02:50:04,990 --> 02:50:05,390
I have friends.

5299
02:50:05,990 --> 02:50:07,450
I don't have any friends.

5300
02:50:07,550 --> 02:50:08,450
What the fuck?

5301
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:12,940
You too.

5302
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:14,000
What the fuck?

5303
02:50:14,300 --> 02:50:17,220
Minch, back out.

5304
02:50:17,260 --> 02:50:17,960
Minch, back up.

5305
02:50:18,100 --> 02:50:18,860
You were too.

5306
02:50:18,980 --> 02:50:20,500
You didn't want me fast enough.

5307
02:50:20,900 --> 02:50:21,780
What the fuck?

5308
02:50:22,360 --> 02:50:23,100
What the fuck?

5309
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:25,480
What the fuck?

5310
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:27,040
You got a point.

5311
02:50:27,100 --> 02:50:27,600
You got a point.

5312
02:50:27,720 --> 02:50:27,740
I'm...

5313
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:28,880
I'm slow.

5314
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:31,760
You got a point.

5315
02:50:31,800 --> 02:50:32,220
You got a point.

5316
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:33,440
I'm gonna go right on top of you.

5317
02:50:33,500 --> 02:50:34,520
She just got something recently, okay?

5318
02:50:34,820 --> 02:50:36,820
She's trying to get everything back.

5319
02:50:37,180 --> 02:50:37,480
Yeah.

5320
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:38,040
God.

5321
02:50:38,140 --> 02:50:38,500
Get everything.

5322
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:39,480
Get back.

5323
02:50:39,480 --> 02:50:40,080
Oh, my God.

5324
02:50:40,520 --> 02:50:43,000
I can't even get my stuff back because you killed me.

5325
02:50:43,120 --> 02:50:43,460
Yeah, you can.

5326
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:44,240
Yeah, you can.

5327
02:50:44,340 --> 02:50:45,140
Where is it?

5328
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:46,060
I'm stuck.

5329
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:49,300
Let us go to the charger and then you're gonna go get your stuff, okay?

5330
02:50:49,360 --> 02:50:49,620
Okay.

5331
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:50,220
I'm gonna get...

5332
02:50:51,220 --> 02:50:52,800
I'm gonna get hit by the charger.

5333
02:50:53,020 --> 02:50:53,200
Oh.

5334
02:50:53,260 --> 02:50:53,700
Oh, wait.

5335
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:54,480
I'm actually stuck.

5336
02:50:54,740 --> 02:50:55,480
Oh, no, no, no.

5337
02:50:55,480 --> 02:50:55,900
Wait.

5338
02:50:55,920 --> 02:50:56,780
I'm actually stuck.

5339
02:50:57,260 --> 02:50:58,300
Oh, no, no, no, no.

5340
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:02,260
It's a good thing you didn't get your stuff then because then you'll die again and you'll get your stuff after.

5341
02:51:02,300 --> 02:51:02,440
No.

5342
02:51:02,480 --> 02:51:03,580
He's just staring at me.

5343
02:51:05,860 --> 02:51:06,620
I got him.

5344
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:07,080
I got his butt.

5345
02:51:07,160 --> 02:51:07,620
I got his butt.

5346
02:51:07,720 --> 02:51:07,980
Okay.

5347
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:09,200
Okay.

5348
02:51:09,220 --> 02:51:09,540
Let me...

5349
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:10,540
Oh, people are saying dive.

5350
02:51:11,300 --> 02:51:11,620
Oh.

5351
02:51:11,940 --> 02:51:12,260
Okay.

5352
02:51:12,760 --> 02:51:13,380
Get up now.

5353
02:51:13,620 --> 02:51:14,060
No, run.

5354
02:51:14,480 --> 02:51:14,640
Oh.

5355
02:51:15,100 --> 02:51:15,700
Thanks, guys.

5356
02:51:15,800 --> 02:51:16,060
Run.

5357
02:51:16,600 --> 02:51:16,920
Thanks.

5358
02:51:16,980 --> 02:51:17,880
I was safer.

5359
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:20,060
I was safer being there to be honest.

5360
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:21,580
I think so too because I was shooting his butt.

5361
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:21,920
Yeah.

5362
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:23,080
I was distracting him.

5363
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:23,320
Yeah.

5364
02:51:23,320 --> 02:51:24,020
We're pretty good.

5365
02:51:24,460 --> 02:51:24,940
We're gaming now.

5366
02:51:24,940 --> 02:51:25,260
We're pretty good.

5367
02:51:25,260 --> 02:51:26,280
I wonder what those two are up to.

5368
02:51:26,480 --> 02:51:27,180
I think they're fine.

5369
02:51:27,220 --> 02:51:27,580
Yeah.

5370
02:51:27,580 --> 02:51:27,960
We're gaming.

5371
02:51:27,960 --> 02:51:28,580
We're doing good.

5372
02:51:28,580 --> 02:51:29,120
We're gaming.

5373
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:29,260
Yeah.

5374
02:51:29,260 --> 02:51:30,180
Are you still alive?

5375
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:30,780
Yep.

5376
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:31,540
I'm still alive.

5377
02:51:33,400 --> 02:51:33,760
Oh.

5378
02:51:34,100 --> 02:51:34,460
Oh.

5379
02:51:34,500 --> 02:51:34,700
Hey.

5380
02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:35,840
I got you.

5381
02:51:35,960 --> 02:51:36,420
I got you.

5382
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:37,100
Thank you.

5383
02:51:37,140 --> 02:51:37,680
Thank you.

5384
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:38,140
You're alive.

5385
02:51:38,500 --> 02:51:38,640
Here.

5386
02:51:38,640 --> 02:51:38,920
Come here.

5387
02:51:38,960 --> 02:51:39,080
Come here.

5388
02:51:39,100 --> 02:51:39,440
Come here.

5389
02:51:39,440 --> 02:51:42,140
I don't know how long I'll be alive for, to be honest.

5390
02:51:42,280 --> 02:51:42,960
You're alive forever.

5391
02:51:43,280 --> 02:51:44,180
Don't worry, baby girl.

5392
02:51:45,080 --> 02:51:47,540
I got to make sure my bitch, Henya, stays alive.

5393
02:51:48,400 --> 02:51:50,760
I got to make sure my bitch, Henya, stays alive.

5394
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:51,240
I got to make sure my bitch, Henya, stays alive.

5395
02:51:51,240 --> 02:51:51,400
Oh, sorry.

5396
02:51:51,460 --> 02:51:53,000
I got to make sure my tongue, Henya, stays alive.

5397
02:51:56,160 --> 02:51:57,340
You're getting acquainted.

5398
02:51:59,000 --> 02:51:59,460
I'm learning.

5399
02:52:00,240 --> 02:52:01,260
I'm learning a lot.

5400
02:52:01,340 --> 02:52:02,360
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

5401
02:52:02,620 --> 02:52:02,920
Uh-oh.

5402
02:52:04,040 --> 02:52:05,460
Do you have a second gun?

5403
02:52:05,540 --> 02:52:06,280
Press number two?

5404
02:52:06,420 --> 02:52:07,580
Yeah, but it's not good.

5405
02:52:07,640 --> 02:52:07,940
Not yet.

5406
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:08,260
Okay.

5407
02:52:08,260 --> 02:52:08,500
Got it.

5408
02:52:08,680 --> 02:52:09,420
It's better than mine.

5409
02:52:09,420 --> 02:52:09,600
Okay.

5410
02:52:13,480 --> 02:52:14,200
All right.

5411
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:15,160
Let's go towards them, then.

5412
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:16,220
Actually, no.

5413
02:52:16,220 --> 02:52:17,100
This is where we evacuate.

5414
02:52:17,660 --> 02:52:18,120
Oh, yeah.

5415
02:52:18,140 --> 02:52:18,280
No.

5416
02:52:18,360 --> 02:52:19,120
Let's go towards them.

5417
02:52:19,140 --> 02:52:19,560
That's where we...

5418
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:19,940
Just run.

5419
02:52:19,960 --> 02:52:20,800
Why am I so slow?

5420
02:52:21,020 --> 02:52:22,080
Why am I so slow?

5421
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:25,220
I think I'm going to die.

5422
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:25,760
I think I'm...

5423
02:52:26,840 --> 02:52:27,400
Just run.

5424
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:27,700
Just run.

5425
02:52:27,720 --> 02:52:27,940
Just run.

5426
02:52:28,060 --> 02:52:28,380
I'm...

5427
02:52:28,380 --> 02:52:29,320
I am...

5428
02:52:29,320 --> 02:52:30,680
I'm doing the best that I...

5429
02:52:30,680 --> 02:52:30,740
Oh.

5430
02:52:32,680 --> 02:52:34,160
The little bitch that could...

5431
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:35,000
Why am I so fucking close to the bitch?

5432
02:52:35,540 --> 02:52:35,900
Yeah.

5433
02:52:35,900 --> 02:52:36,240
Yeah.

5434
02:52:36,880 --> 02:52:37,240
Yeah.

5435
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:38,040
Yeah.

5436
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:38,180
Yeah.

5437
02:52:39,420 --> 02:52:39,560
Oh.

5438
02:52:39,740 --> 02:52:40,100
Hey.

5439
02:52:40,240 --> 02:52:40,600
Hey.

5440
02:52:40,940 --> 02:52:42,900
Get out of my bag.

5441
02:52:43,160 --> 02:52:44,160
Get out of my bag.

5442
02:52:44,180 --> 02:52:45,100
Oh, it's the little...

5443
02:52:45,100 --> 02:52:46,320
A white one's done.

5444
02:52:46,500 --> 02:52:46,640
Yeah.

5445
02:52:46,840 --> 02:52:47,900
There are so many of us.

5446
02:52:47,960 --> 02:52:48,400
Oh, my gosh.

5447
02:52:50,380 --> 02:52:51,100
I am...

5448
02:52:51,100 --> 02:52:52,600
Min can come to us closer now.

5449
02:52:52,700 --> 02:52:54,140
I had no more stims, you guys.

5450
02:52:54,180 --> 02:52:55,180
I had no more stims.

5451
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:55,460
Run.

5452
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:56,100
Run to them.

5453
02:52:56,160 --> 02:52:57,740
I'm going to clear the little box.

5454
02:52:57,760 --> 02:52:57,820
No.

5455
02:52:57,880 --> 02:52:58,360
I'm dead.

5456
02:52:58,500 --> 02:52:58,720
Oh.

5457
02:52:58,780 --> 02:52:59,100
Oh.

5458
02:52:59,100 --> 02:52:59,360
Okay.

5459
02:52:59,540 --> 02:52:59,900
No.

5460
02:53:00,300 --> 02:53:00,660
No.

5461
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:02,140
Maka, the ship is down already.

5462
02:53:02,220 --> 02:53:03,640
We're waiting for everyone to come here.

5463
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:03,680
Yeah.

5464
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:04,680
We're waiting for you guys to come.

5465
02:53:04,680 --> 02:53:05,060
Well, yeah.

5466
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:05,840
We're trying.

5467
02:53:09,500 --> 02:53:09,980
We're trying.

5468
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:11,960
We're trying.

5469
02:53:11,960 --> 02:53:12,700
Oh, this is water.

5470
02:53:12,780 --> 02:53:13,500
This is water.

5471
02:53:13,580 --> 02:53:14,060
No comment.

5472
02:53:14,100 --> 02:53:14,400
Sorry.

5473
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:17,640
This is water.

5474
02:53:18,220 --> 02:53:19,760
You guys are over there.

5475
02:53:19,840 --> 02:53:22,720
In case of making out, we're hanging out with the victims of democracy.

5476
02:53:23,360 --> 02:53:24,300
I got you.

5477
02:53:24,320 --> 02:53:26,080
Now we have only seven reinforcements.

5478
02:53:27,420 --> 02:53:28,360
I think we're here.

5479
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:30,720
I think we're doing a really good job.

5480
02:53:30,720 --> 02:53:31,160
Right, Mata?

5481
02:53:31,680 --> 02:53:32,800
I think we are too.

5482
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:33,240
Keep going.

5483
02:53:33,360 --> 02:53:34,060
We're gaming.

5484
02:53:34,060 --> 02:53:34,720
And then to the left?

5485
02:53:34,880 --> 02:53:35,400
And then...

5486
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:35,940
Oh, to the left.

5487
02:53:36,020 --> 02:53:36,140
Oh.

5488
02:53:36,140 --> 02:53:36,800
No, to the left.

5489
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:38,080
Oh, my God.

5490
02:53:38,680 --> 02:53:39,400
What is this?

5491
02:53:39,400 --> 02:53:39,760
Oh, my God.

5492
02:53:39,760 --> 02:53:40,080
Was that you?

5493
02:53:40,740 --> 02:53:41,100
No.

5494
02:53:41,540 --> 02:53:43,420
Guys, you should summon her next to you.

5495
02:53:43,660 --> 02:53:44,640
Summon her where you are.

5496
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:46,260
And I'll run.

5497
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:48,020
Cut my head off.

5498
02:53:48,040 --> 02:53:48,680
Oh, God.

5499
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:48,980
Oh, God.

5500
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:49,220
Oh, God.

5501
02:53:49,240 --> 02:53:49,460
Oh, God.

5502
02:53:49,460 --> 02:53:49,660
Oh, God.

5503
02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:52,180
Cut my head in two pieces.

5504
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:53,020
I can't read his voice.

5505
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:54,060
I can't read his voice.

5506
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:55,200
My game is off.

5507
02:53:55,280 --> 02:53:55,600
Yeah.

5508
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:57,900
I think she meant the other left, you guys.

5509
02:53:59,500 --> 02:53:59,860
Oh.

5510
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:02,240
Here I come.

5511
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:02,760
I'm coming.

5512
02:54:02,780 --> 02:54:03,040
I'm coming.

5513
02:54:03,100 --> 02:54:03,460
I'm coming.

5514
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:05,220
Wait for me.

5515
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:07,400
Wait for me.

5516
02:54:07,560 --> 02:54:07,600
Wait for me.

5517
02:54:07,600 --> 02:54:07,880
Wait for me.

5518
02:54:08,580 --> 02:54:09,220
Wait for me.

5519
02:54:09,220 --> 02:54:10,660
Guys, just get in the car.

5520
02:54:11,320 --> 02:54:12,940
No, no, because then it'll leave.

5521
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:18,840
Now you guys can leave.

5522
02:54:18,900 --> 02:54:20,640
I think it lowers our experience.

5523
02:54:21,240 --> 02:54:21,760
Wait!

5524
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:24,940
It lowers our experience, but it's fine.

5525
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:27,240
My samples!

5526
02:54:30,240 --> 02:54:32,160
Sorry, Haru.

5527
02:54:32,280 --> 02:54:35,840
Sometimes I just start killing the bugs and not looking at the mission.

5528
02:54:36,120 --> 02:54:36,660
I'm reloading.

5529
02:54:36,700 --> 02:54:38,820
So you guys should've just been like, oh guys, we're at the end.

5530
02:54:38,900 --> 02:54:41,640
We're doing the... because we were just having fun.

5531
02:54:43,220 --> 02:54:46,060
Do you see why I invited Haruka to this collab?

5532
02:54:46,300 --> 02:54:47,960
Because she actually gets the shit done.

5533
02:54:49,660 --> 02:54:51,440
I... wait, it bugged?

5534
02:54:51,440 --> 02:54:52,620
Wait, some people said you died.

5535
02:54:53,240 --> 02:54:53,680
No, it didn't.

5536
02:54:53,680 --> 02:54:54,320
It didn't bug.

5537
02:54:54,500 --> 02:54:57,860
No, no, Kenya had the stratagem glitch, so she couldn't put down any stratagems.

5538
02:54:58,040 --> 02:54:58,440
Oh, yeah, wait.

5539
02:54:58,720 --> 02:55:01,040
Oh, I made it!

5540
02:55:01,060 --> 02:55:01,380
Yippee!

5541
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:02,900
Wait, why did I...

5542
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:03,900
How are you the only one?

5543
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:04,380
I don't know.

5544
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:05,440
Huh?

5545
02:55:06,100 --> 02:55:07,060
I left them behind.

5546
02:55:07,160 --> 02:55:08,160
Did you get into the ship?

5547
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:09,860
Did you actually run into the ship?

5548
02:55:10,100 --> 02:55:11,920
Maybe on accident, but I don't know.

5549
02:55:13,860 --> 02:55:14,300
Mince.

5550
02:55:14,300 --> 02:55:15,720
Honestly, pretty bait.

5551
02:55:15,980 --> 02:55:17,080
Shaking my head.

5552
02:55:17,580 --> 02:55:18,360
Shaking my head.

5553
02:55:18,360 --> 02:55:20,620
Hey, this is my first time playing this game, okay?

5554
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:22,760
Shaking my head.

5555
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:24,540
Oh, the ship got damaged?

5556
02:55:24,740 --> 02:55:26,100
The shuttle extraction bug?

5557
02:55:26,740 --> 02:55:27,180
Oh...

5558
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:30,700
Wait, if the ship get damaged, they will start the ship?

5559
02:55:31,260 --> 02:55:34,480
I think I was trying to get away from a bug and I dove into the ship.

5560
02:55:35,320 --> 02:55:36,280
That's pretty bait.

5561
02:55:37,940 --> 02:55:39,160
Dun dun dun dun.

5562
02:55:41,580 --> 02:55:42,060
Yippee!

5563
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:43,200
I cannot believe it, Mince.

5564
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:44,500
You ruined everything.

5565
02:55:44,520 --> 02:55:45,760
I got to the ship!

5566
02:55:45,880 --> 02:55:46,820
I made it alive!

5567
02:55:47,280 --> 02:55:48,760
You ruined everything.

5568
02:55:51,280 --> 02:55:52,080
I did it.

5569
02:55:52,080 --> 02:55:54,560
Everything I ever loved, everything I ever worked for.

5570
02:55:55,280 --> 02:55:58,460
How the fuck did Matora Khan not die a single time?

5571
02:55:58,520 --> 02:55:58,980
That's crazy.

5572
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:00,380
Yo, it's called gaming.

5573
02:56:01,300 --> 02:56:02,300
He didn't die a single time?

5574
02:56:02,460 --> 02:56:04,300
Bada bam, bada bing, bada boom.

5575
02:56:04,300 --> 02:56:05,240
Bada boom.

5576
02:56:05,920 --> 02:56:06,720
Bada boom.

5577
02:56:09,360 --> 02:56:13,520
I thought you're not supposed to have capes.

5578
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:17,500
Um, Mince, we are hell divers.

5579
02:56:17,700 --> 02:56:19,880
It's a requirement to have a cape.

5580
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:21,000
I'm sorry, yeah.

5581
02:56:21,780 --> 02:56:24,980
It's not that we're superheroes we're not supposed to have a cape.

5582
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:29,440
Listen, Mince, not wearing a cape is the most least democratic thing we can do.

5583
02:56:30,080 --> 02:56:31,300
Oh, true, true, true.

5584
02:56:31,300 --> 02:56:32,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5585
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:34,180
True, true, true.

5586
02:56:34,820 --> 02:56:35,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5587
02:56:36,680 --> 02:56:38,520
Are we not superheroes, you guys?

5588
02:56:38,660 --> 02:56:40,960
It's a superhero rule, but are we not superheroes?

5589
02:56:41,380 --> 02:56:43,900
We are protecting, we are bringing democracy.

5590
02:56:43,980 --> 02:56:45,480
Is that not a superhero thing?

5591
02:56:48,980 --> 02:56:50,520
Bada bing, bada boom.

5592
02:56:51,380 --> 02:56:52,620
My headphones cut out.

5593
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:53,960
Can you re-say that whole thing?

5594
02:56:54,140 --> 02:56:55,360
I said bada bing, bada bam.

5595
02:56:55,580 --> 02:56:56,360
Bam, bam, bam.

5596
02:56:56,480 --> 02:56:57,460
Bada bang, bam, bing.

5597
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:00,120
Bada bing, bada boom.

5598
02:57:00,140 --> 02:57:01,140
Bada bing, bada boom.

5599
02:57:01,840 --> 02:57:02,800
Bing, bing, bong.

5600
02:57:02,820 --> 02:57:04,560
Bing, bing, bing, bong, bing, bong, bing, bong.

5601
02:57:04,780 --> 02:57:05,900
Bing, bong, bing, bong, bing, bong.

5602
02:57:06,460 --> 02:57:08,840
Here, I'll translate for you.

5603
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:10,360
Mince, say your thing.

5604
02:57:10,440 --> 02:57:10,960
I'll translate.

5605
02:57:11,240 --> 02:57:13,040
Bada bam, bing, bong, bing, bing, bong.

5606
02:57:13,620 --> 02:57:18,480
So she said that are we not superheroes because we're spreading democracy because we have kids?

5607
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:19,280
Are we not superheroes?

5608
02:57:19,820 --> 02:57:21,040
That's basically what she said.

5609
02:57:21,180 --> 02:57:21,440
Yeah.

5610
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:22,300
Yeah.

5611
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:23,640
Yeah.

5612
02:57:29,940 --> 02:57:31,920
I think we're going crazy.

5613
02:57:31,980 --> 02:57:32,900
I think so, too.

5614
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:34,040
I don't know what's happening.

5615
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:39,820
I blame him, yeah.

5616
02:57:40,440 --> 02:57:42,260
I'm speaking my truth.

5617
02:57:42,820 --> 02:57:43,760
Wah, wah, wah.

5618
02:57:43,980 --> 02:57:44,500
Wah, wah, wah.

5619
02:57:45,060 --> 02:57:46,560
Say it from your chest.

5620
02:57:47,580 --> 02:57:49,080
Wah, wah, wah.

5621
02:57:49,080 --> 02:57:50,300
Wah, wah, wah.

5622
02:57:52,720 --> 02:57:54,160
Say it with your balls, Mint.

5623
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:55,380
What am I saying?

5624
02:57:56,180 --> 02:57:57,000
Your truth.

5625
02:57:57,200 --> 02:57:58,780
Bing, bing, bong, bing.

5626
02:57:59,800 --> 02:58:01,520
Bing, bing, bong.

5627
02:58:01,620 --> 02:58:03,040
Bing, bing, bong, bing, bong.

5628
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:04,620
Bing, bing, bong, bing, bong.

5629
02:58:07,260 --> 02:58:09,460
Bing, bing, bong, bing, bong.

5630
02:58:09,460 --> 02:58:11,180
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bong.

5631
02:58:11,580 --> 02:58:12,180
Bing, bing, bong, bing, bong.

5632
02:58:12,920 --> 02:58:15,300
Bing, bing, bong, bing, bong.

5633
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:18,960
Bing, bing, bong, bing, bong.

5634
02:58:21,220 --> 02:58:22,060
You know what?

5635
02:58:22,080 --> 02:58:25,260
It's very rare when the second season of an anime is better than the first one.

5636
02:58:25,260 --> 02:58:27,020
Wait, guys, I'm going to re-join the game.

5637
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:28,040
My game is still glitched.

5638
02:58:28,480 --> 02:58:29,440
Oh wait, why did I?

5639
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:31,200
Oh no, I spawned in the worst place.

5640
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:32,120
Oh god.

5641
02:58:34,700 --> 02:58:36,580
But why did you already?

5642
02:58:40,620 --> 02:58:45,780
It's not very often that the second season of an anime's OP is better than the first one, really.

5643
02:58:45,980 --> 02:58:46,400
What is that from?

5644
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:47,780
I just know the song.

5645
02:58:47,780 --> 02:58:49,380
It's from Mastral.

5646
02:58:49,800 --> 02:58:51,020
Yeah, Machiru, Machiru.

5647
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:54,700
It's really funny.

5648
02:58:56,280 --> 02:58:59,680
It's basically if one punch man goes to a wizard school.

5649
02:59:02,040 --> 02:59:07,200
So basically, he's born without any magic and he has to punch his way.

5650
02:59:07,480 --> 02:59:11,740
And people are like, oh my god, that was his magical power!

5651
02:59:12,440 --> 02:59:13,920
It's really fucking funny.

5652
02:59:13,940 --> 02:59:14,500
It's just punching?

5653
02:59:14,920 --> 02:59:16,100
I like that.

5654
02:59:16,120 --> 02:59:16,940
That is pretty magic.

5655
02:59:17,020 --> 02:59:17,760
I don't want to spoil that.

5656
02:59:17,780 --> 02:59:19,240
I don't want to spoil the first episode because it's really fucking funny.

5657
02:59:19,360 --> 02:59:20,640
So please watch Mastral.

5658
02:59:20,720 --> 02:59:21,100
No spoilers!

5659
02:59:21,240 --> 02:59:22,020
I watched the first episode!

5660
02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:23,620
It was fun!

5661
02:59:23,880 --> 02:59:24,280
Yes!

5662
02:59:24,720 --> 02:59:26,280
I need to finish season 2.

5663
02:59:26,360 --> 02:59:27,640
That is not a person.

5664
02:59:27,660 --> 02:59:28,080
I don't like it.

5665
02:59:28,120 --> 02:59:29,420
I don't like it.

5666
02:59:31,720 --> 02:59:32,260
I'm okay.

5667
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:33,280
I'm alright.

5668
02:59:33,300 --> 02:59:35,960
Also, Mint, this is not your eyes.

5669
02:59:36,160 --> 02:59:37,140
This is just...

5670
02:59:37,720 --> 02:59:40,040
I feel like I'm playing Metal Gear Solid 3 right now.

5671
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:42,980
Oh no, this is what it's going to look like?

5672
02:59:43,520 --> 02:59:44,600
Yeah, it's just...

5673
02:59:49,560 --> 02:59:51,200
It's because there's a spore spawner.

5674
02:59:51,280 --> 02:59:52,000
Oh, I died.

5675
02:59:54,200 --> 02:59:54,940
Not anymore.

5676
02:59:55,160 --> 02:59:55,620
Come back.

5677
02:59:56,100 --> 02:59:57,260
War never ends.

5678
02:59:57,360 --> 02:59:57,620
Rise!

5679
02:59:57,820 --> 02:59:58,920
Summon me again!

5680
03:00:00,260 --> 03:00:01,300
MATARO KON!

5681
03:00:02,320 --> 03:00:04,940
Out of the atmosphere, I gotta disappear.

5682
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:06,520
Fuck.

5683
03:00:06,680 --> 03:00:07,360
I'm stuck.

5684
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:09,800
There's a spore mushroom that I see.

5685
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:12,360
Oh my god, these guys in the sky?

5686
03:00:13,100 --> 03:00:13,940
Oh, what?

5687
03:00:13,940 --> 03:00:14,780
They're not dead yet?

5688
03:00:14,780 --> 03:00:15,960
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a guy.

5689
03:00:16,260 --> 03:00:17,560
Oh, jeez.

5690
03:00:17,600 --> 03:00:18,120
There's...

5691
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:19,020
How...

5692
03:00:20,080 --> 03:00:21,500
How the hell...

5693
03:00:24,300 --> 03:00:24,980
There we go.

5694
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:25,920
Oh, good job, Haruka.

5695
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:27,420
See, this is why I brought Haruka.

5696
03:00:28,100 --> 03:00:29,300
We needed a gamer.

5697
03:00:30,860 --> 03:00:31,340
Gamer!

5698
03:00:33,980 --> 03:00:35,440
You are so annoying!

5699
03:00:35,740 --> 03:00:37,120
I just played a game.

5700
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:38,460
Oh my god.

5701
03:00:38,480 --> 03:00:38,760
No.

5702
03:00:38,960 --> 03:00:39,360
Oh, you just played?

5703
03:00:41,820 --> 03:00:42,300
God!

5704
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:44,040
Oh god!

5705
03:00:44,180 --> 03:00:44,880
Oh god!

5706
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:45,680
Oh gosh.

5707
03:00:45,860 --> 03:00:46,480
Oh gosh.

5708
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:48,960
Why are there so many of them?

5709
03:00:51,240 --> 03:00:51,780
Wrong way!

5710
03:00:52,720 --> 03:00:53,860
Oh, there you go.

5711
03:00:53,860 --> 03:00:54,340
It's fixed.

5712
03:00:54,500 --> 03:00:54,900
Nice.

5713
03:00:55,820 --> 03:00:56,700
Good job.

5714
03:00:57,500 --> 03:00:58,100
Alright.

5715
03:00:59,580 --> 03:01:00,520
Haruka carry.

5716
03:01:00,940 --> 03:01:01,980
That's our girl.

5717
03:01:02,280 --> 03:01:03,300
Where is everybody?

5718
03:01:04,820 --> 03:01:05,820
Hiding from you.

5719
03:01:06,460 --> 03:01:07,460
I get that.

5720
03:01:08,280 --> 03:01:11,220
Hiding my way from you.

5721
03:01:11,740 --> 03:01:12,340
No.

5722
03:01:12,480 --> 03:01:13,420
Don't turn your back.

5723
03:01:13,500 --> 03:01:13,660
No.

5724
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:16,320
Wanna be a professional.

5725
03:01:16,680 --> 03:01:18,140
I'm so into you.

5726
03:01:19,080 --> 03:01:20,120
Oh my god.

5727
03:01:21,200 --> 03:01:22,220
Let me take...

5728
03:01:22,220 --> 03:01:22,780
Oh my god.

5729
03:01:22,780 --> 03:01:23,980
I cannot aim for these birds.

5730
03:01:24,260 --> 03:01:25,040
I know.

5731
03:01:25,060 --> 03:01:25,520
They suck.

5732
03:01:27,260 --> 03:01:28,460
The one sucks.

5733
03:01:28,880 --> 03:01:29,720
He's nuts.

5734
03:01:30,240 --> 03:01:30,800
Yeah!

5735
03:01:36,450 --> 03:01:37,630
Oh my gosh.

5736
03:01:37,630 --> 03:01:38,150
Little guy.

5737
03:01:38,210 --> 03:01:39,110
I will now graduate.

5738
03:01:39,210 --> 03:01:41,590
This is the only peak humor I can do.

5739
03:01:41,870 --> 03:01:43,010
My ears bleeding.

5740
03:01:46,150 --> 03:01:46,990
From the...

5741
03:01:46,990 --> 03:01:47,410
From the...

5742
03:01:47,410 --> 03:01:48,470
From the joke or the what?

5743
03:01:49,850 --> 03:01:51,770
It's a gift, Tenya, from me to you.

5744
03:01:53,430 --> 03:01:55,070
Thank you for the gift, Tenya.

5745
03:01:56,990 --> 03:01:57,510
Bullshit!

5746
03:01:57,750 --> 03:01:58,170
You're welcome.

5747
03:01:58,710 --> 03:01:59,570
Oh my gosh.

5748
03:02:00,290 --> 03:02:01,590
Freedom never sleeps!

5749
03:02:01,910 --> 03:02:07,030
So I did not mean to say shit on your stream, Mint, but fuck, I am about to die.

5750
03:02:07,350 --> 03:02:08,010
That's okay.

5751
03:02:09,110 --> 03:02:09,850
That's okay.

5752
03:02:10,510 --> 03:02:13,770
I say... I accidentally say bad things too sometimes.

5753
03:02:14,930 --> 03:02:16,910
Mint casually bites the center nose.

5754
03:02:16,910 --> 03:02:18,770
Haruka is about to...

5755
03:02:20,170 --> 03:02:21,770
...breathe her last breath today.

5756
03:02:23,590 --> 03:02:24,310
Oh shit.

5757
03:02:24,890 --> 03:02:26,470
Oh, I see I said it too on accident.

5758
03:02:28,510 --> 03:02:30,530
Oh, I'm out of ammo on everything.

5759
03:02:30,730 --> 03:02:31,470
You said those words?

5760
03:02:32,030 --> 03:02:32,690
It's okay, Mint.

5761
03:02:32,730 --> 03:02:33,110
I got you.

5762
03:02:33,450 --> 03:02:33,850
You do?

5763
03:02:34,070 --> 03:02:34,690
Death note?

5764
03:02:34,790 --> 03:02:35,170
Where are you?

5765
03:02:35,210 --> 03:02:36,490
Well, I mean, I got the charger.

5766
03:02:36,890 --> 03:02:37,290
Oh.

5767
03:02:37,310 --> 03:02:38,510
Well, there was another charger.

5768
03:02:38,590 --> 03:02:38,830
Oh!

5769
03:02:39,750 --> 03:02:40,410
I got the guy!

5770
03:02:41,190 --> 03:02:42,230
I got the guy!

5771
03:02:42,270 --> 03:02:43,590
What the fuck are you...

5772
03:02:43,590 --> 03:02:45,090
I like how you said that.

5773
03:02:45,170 --> 03:02:46,050
That was actually very cute.

5774
03:02:46,670 --> 03:02:47,690
Not that I can.

5775
03:02:48,030 --> 03:02:48,990
Not that I can!

5776
03:02:49,130 --> 03:02:49,270
That was very cute.

5777
03:02:49,470 --> 03:02:50,230
I kinda liked it.

5778
03:02:50,530 --> 03:02:51,810
Oh yeah, I gotta get...

5779
03:02:51,810 --> 03:02:52,290
Oh, wait.

5780
03:02:52,350 --> 03:02:53,290
I was angry.

5781
03:02:53,510 --> 03:02:57,210
I have this gun that like, shoots lasers.

5782
03:02:57,890 --> 03:03:01,950
But if friendly people are in the line of fire, it...

5783
03:03:01,950 --> 03:03:03,770
Also, shoots the friendly people.

5784
03:03:04,010 --> 03:03:04,470
Yeah.

5785
03:03:04,490 --> 03:03:06,710
That's a funny thing that is.

5786
03:03:06,710 --> 03:03:07,170
It's very fun.

5787
03:03:07,250 --> 03:03:08,070
That's why I use it.

5788
03:03:09,210 --> 03:03:11,070
That's fucked up, LaTara!

5789
03:03:11,510 --> 03:03:12,910
There's everybody here.

5790
03:03:12,930 --> 03:03:13,350
Oh!

5791
03:03:15,710 --> 03:03:16,510
Not me.

5792
03:03:19,760 --> 03:03:21,500
They have a taste of democracy.

5793
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:23,580
Wait, is that the ARC gun?

5794
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:25,220
Yeah, the ARC rifle.

5795
03:03:25,320 --> 03:03:25,720
I love it.

5796
03:03:26,840 --> 03:03:27,640
I'm reloading.

5797
03:03:28,140 --> 03:03:30,280
Don't reload it when the bugs are right by you.

5798
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:33,880
I didn't realize that it was going to be that kind of reload.

5799
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:35,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5800
03:03:36,540 --> 03:03:38,140
Oh yeah, the machine gun has that.

5801
03:03:38,400 --> 03:03:39,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5802
03:03:39,560 --> 03:03:40,380
I didn't realize.

5803
03:03:41,140 --> 03:03:42,680
Alright, let's go do the side mission.

5804
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:43,620
We're here.

5805
03:03:43,900 --> 03:03:44,420
Let's do it.

5806
03:03:44,580 --> 03:03:45,060
Okay!

5807
03:03:46,100 --> 03:03:46,580
For science!

5808
03:03:48,320 --> 03:03:49,280
For science!

5809
03:03:49,700 --> 03:03:51,640
I don't think I've done this one before.

5810
03:03:51,840 --> 03:03:52,900
I don't even know where to go.

5811
03:03:52,900 --> 03:03:53,600
What are we doing?

5812
03:03:53,760 --> 03:03:56,880
What are we doing?

5813
03:03:58,780 --> 03:03:59,520
I don't know.

5814
03:03:59,740 --> 03:04:01,080
I'm trying to find it.

5815
03:04:01,440 --> 03:04:01,920
Science!

5816
03:04:01,980 --> 03:04:03,440
We should look for a computer.

5817
03:04:03,880 --> 03:04:04,320
A computer!

5818
03:04:04,820 --> 03:04:05,060
Okay.

5819
03:04:05,220 --> 03:04:06,300
But I don't see a computer.

5820
03:04:06,940 --> 03:04:08,200
I'm going to go destroy X.

5821
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:09,900
Good girl.

5822
03:04:10,540 --> 03:04:11,000
X.

5823
03:04:11,300 --> 03:04:12,820
Oh, it's the hell bomb.

5824
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:14,020
Hell bomb?

5825
03:04:14,340 --> 03:04:15,560
We don't have the hell bomb though.

5826
03:04:16,900 --> 03:04:19,660
You have to call in a hell bomb near the grey building.

5827
03:04:19,980 --> 03:04:22,540
You sent us on a wild goose chase.

5828
03:04:23,820 --> 03:04:24,980
We're already here.

5829
03:04:25,420 --> 03:04:26,320
Oh, I see it.

5830
03:04:26,360 --> 03:04:26,700
Okay, mint?

5831
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:27,340
Yeah.

5832
03:04:28,780 --> 03:04:29,240
Run.

5833
03:04:31,320 --> 03:04:32,080
Run far.

5834
03:04:32,940 --> 03:04:34,780
Oh hey, you're here with me, Dayo.

5835
03:04:34,940 --> 03:04:36,520
Yeah, I'm here, Dayo.

5836
03:04:36,660 --> 03:04:37,360
I came here.

5837
03:04:38,620 --> 03:04:39,300
For you.

5838
03:04:39,300 --> 03:04:41,520
You're like, I'm just getting killed by Matara two times.

5839
03:04:41,620 --> 03:04:42,140
I'm here.

5840
03:04:42,460 --> 03:04:43,120
What did you do?

5841
03:04:43,700 --> 03:04:44,680
Why did you do that?

5842
03:04:45,380 --> 03:04:45,700
Sorry.

5843
03:04:48,220 --> 03:04:49,880
To be honest, I didn't think you were going to die.

5844
03:04:49,900 --> 03:04:50,100
My bad.

5845
03:04:51,060 --> 03:04:52,000
Watch out, Hanyang.

5846
03:04:52,040 --> 03:04:52,920
Did I mess up the hell bomb?

5847
03:04:53,400 --> 03:04:54,040
Okay, okay.

5848
03:04:54,180 --> 03:04:54,580
I'm leaving.

5849
03:04:54,580 --> 03:04:55,460
Yeah, you deserve that.

5850
03:04:55,500 --> 03:04:56,740
You deserve to mess it up.

5851
03:04:57,320 --> 03:04:58,060
Where are you?

5852
03:04:58,100 --> 03:04:59,160
I'm going to land right on your head.

5853
03:04:59,160 --> 03:04:59,580
Did I mess up the hell bomb?

5854
03:05:00,120 --> 03:05:01,800
You messed up everything, Matara!

5855
03:05:02,640 --> 03:05:03,560
What's going on there?

5856
03:05:04,840 --> 03:05:07,120
Oh, I had to punch in the code in the hell bomb.

5857
03:05:07,360 --> 03:05:07,680
Fudge.

5858
03:05:07,780 --> 03:05:08,540
Okay, I'm sorry, mint.

5859
03:05:08,540 --> 03:05:10,700
This is why I brought Haruka, because I don't know how to do anything.

5860
03:05:11,360 --> 03:05:12,220
Yeah, I can tell.

5861
03:05:15,340 --> 03:05:16,080
Where's the bomb?

5862
03:05:16,320 --> 03:05:18,400
So you have to go back inside and...

5863
03:05:18,400 --> 03:05:21,040
Yeah, I think I have to like activate the code on it.

5864
03:05:21,060 --> 03:05:21,700
Hanyang, be careful.

5865
03:05:21,740 --> 03:05:22,400
I'm going to throw it.

5866
03:05:22,520 --> 03:05:23,040
I'm going to throw it.

5867
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:23,740
Okay.

5868
03:05:24,200 --> 03:05:24,800
I'm running.

5869
03:05:24,860 --> 03:05:25,000
What?

5870
03:05:25,240 --> 03:05:28,260
I just have to find where I put it.

5871
03:05:29,440 --> 03:05:30,240
Where did I...

5872
03:05:30,240 --> 03:05:31,920
Guys, do you know where I summoned the bomb?

5873
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:33,360
I'm going to run the other way.

5874
03:05:33,740 --> 03:05:34,620
Oh, you missed.

5875
03:05:35,280 --> 03:05:36,180
Oh, I missed.

5876
03:05:36,560 --> 03:05:37,760
Did you throw it?

5877
03:05:38,820 --> 03:05:39,840
Oh, thank you.

5878
03:05:39,860 --> 03:05:40,400
Did you do it?

5879
03:05:41,460 --> 03:05:43,180
I'm about to do it.

5880
03:05:43,360 --> 03:05:46,460
I think I'm going to go to where Hanyang and Haruka are.

5881
03:05:46,680 --> 03:05:47,000
Sounds good.

5882
03:05:47,820 --> 03:05:49,060
I think we should do that.

5883
03:05:50,080 --> 03:05:50,860
Nice, we did it.

5884
03:05:50,860 --> 03:05:52,560
There's a bug nest here if you want to do it.

5885
03:05:52,580 --> 03:05:53,420
Nice teamwork.

5886
03:05:53,420 --> 03:05:55,120
I don't want to do anything with you.

5887
03:05:56,140 --> 03:05:57,120
Oh my god.

5888
03:05:57,220 --> 03:05:58,340
Oh my god.

5889
03:06:00,160 --> 03:06:01,960
I'm not there to win this game.

5890
03:06:01,960 --> 03:06:02,500
What the fuck?

5891
03:06:02,600 --> 03:06:04,720
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

5892
03:06:04,940 --> 03:06:05,760
Yee-haw.

5893
03:06:06,380 --> 03:06:06,900
Let's go.

5894
03:06:09,160 --> 03:06:11,540
I'm going to refill my supply pack.

5895
03:06:12,800 --> 03:06:14,600
Don't be anywhere near the bomb.

5896
03:06:14,720 --> 03:06:16,060
Oh, you put the bomb?

5897
03:06:16,500 --> 03:06:16,980
Yeah.

5898
03:06:18,760 --> 03:06:20,560
I put the bomb all right.

5899
03:06:20,880 --> 03:06:21,240
Oh.

5900
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:22,480
Yippee.

5901
03:06:22,880 --> 03:06:24,360
Oh my god, there's a corner right there.

5902
03:06:24,900 --> 03:06:25,600
Where'd she go?

5903
03:06:25,820 --> 03:06:26,300
Oh, here.

5904
03:06:26,500 --> 03:06:27,020
Uh-oh.

5905
03:06:27,600 --> 03:06:29,420
Oh, fuck.

5906
03:06:29,540 --> 03:06:29,760
Oh, wait.

5907
03:06:34,580 --> 03:06:35,520
I love you.

5908
03:06:36,320 --> 03:06:37,160
Not today.

5909
03:06:37,160 --> 03:06:38,360
I'm sorry, but you got to be careful.

5910
03:06:38,360 --> 03:06:39,380
I'm going to use my laser right now.

5911
03:06:39,380 --> 03:06:39,960
What did I...

5912
03:06:39,960 --> 03:06:40,740
What did I miss?

5913
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:42,260
What is it that I missed?

5914
03:06:43,080 --> 03:06:44,300
So, I put...

5915
03:06:44,300 --> 03:06:44,800
I'm sorry.

5916
03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:46,340
I didn't realize you were very close to me.

5917
03:06:46,440 --> 03:06:46,820
Uh-huh.

5918
03:06:46,820 --> 03:06:46,940
I killed myself.

5919
03:06:46,940 --> 03:06:49,460
So, I had summoned, like, my rock.

5920
03:06:49,660 --> 03:06:50,460
Oh, my god.

5921
03:06:50,580 --> 03:06:51,440
I'm about to die.

5922
03:06:51,460 --> 03:06:52,040
I'm about to die.

5923
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:53,900
I was trying to kill the nest with my rock.

5924
03:06:53,900 --> 03:06:54,120
It's my fault.

5925
03:06:54,320 --> 03:06:55,060
Let me give you a shield.

5926
03:06:55,140 --> 03:06:55,580
It's going to help.

5927
03:06:55,620 --> 03:06:55,760
No.

5928
03:06:56,200 --> 03:06:56,460
No.

5929
03:06:57,160 --> 03:06:57,560
What?

5930
03:06:57,560 --> 03:06:57,800
What?

5931
03:06:58,940 --> 03:06:59,580
I'm sorry.

5932
03:06:59,960 --> 03:07:01,060
What was she doing?

5933
03:07:01,060 --> 03:07:02,440
What was she doing?

5934
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:03,000
What?

5935
03:07:03,560 --> 03:07:05,140
I thought you were going to kill me.

5936
03:07:05,140 --> 03:07:05,860
You're not supposed to...

5937
03:07:05,860 --> 03:07:08,760
I thought you were going to kill me.

5938
03:07:08,760 --> 03:07:09,360
You're not supposed to...

5939
03:07:09,360 --> 03:07:09,600
I'm going to resummon you.

5940
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:09,720
Okay.

5941
03:07:10,780 --> 03:07:11,400
We just...

5942
03:07:11,400 --> 03:07:11,880
I killed it.

5943
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:12,440
Oh, okay.

5944
03:07:12,500 --> 03:07:13,640
What the fuck now?

5945
03:07:13,800 --> 03:07:14,200
Thanks.

5946
03:07:15,060 --> 03:07:15,660
Oh, shit.

5947
03:07:15,740 --> 03:07:16,100
You're fucked.

5948
03:07:16,100 --> 03:07:16,160
All right.

5949
03:07:16,160 --> 03:07:16,980
Let's go towards...

5950
03:07:16,980 --> 03:07:18,520
Big red laser equals splat.

5951
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:18,920
Oh.

5952
03:07:18,920 --> 03:07:19,520
Oh, fuck.

5953
03:07:19,580 --> 03:07:19,820
Oh, fuck.

5954
03:07:19,820 --> 03:07:20,260
Oh, fuck.

5955
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:20,360
Oh, fuck.

5956
03:07:20,360 --> 03:07:20,420
Oh, fuck.

5957
03:07:20,420 --> 03:07:20,980
Oh, fuck.

5958
03:07:20,980 --> 03:07:21,400
Oh, fuck.

5959
03:07:21,580 --> 03:07:21,960
Oh, fuck.

5960
03:07:22,060 --> 03:07:22,860
Oh, fuck.

5961
03:07:23,300 --> 03:07:38,180
Oh, fuck.

5962
03:07:38,180 --> 03:07:38,300
Okay.

5963
03:07:38,300 --> 03:07:38,780
I can still remember back.

5964
03:07:38,860 --> 03:07:39,120
It's okay.

5965
03:07:39,220 --> 03:07:39,520
Okay.

5966
03:07:39,780 --> 03:07:40,440
I got this.

5967
03:07:40,500 --> 03:07:41,040
I just got this.

5968
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:41,060
Thank you.

5969
03:07:41,320 --> 03:07:41,460
Thank you.

5970
03:07:41,460 --> 03:07:41,640
Thank you.

5971
03:07:41,840 --> 03:07:42,600
I'm here now.

5972
03:07:43,400 --> 03:07:44,140
You got this.

5973
03:07:44,140 --> 03:07:45,180
I believe in you.

5974
03:07:45,340 --> 03:07:45,760
We're here.

5975
03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:47,460
We're close-ish.

5976
03:07:47,740 --> 03:07:47,860
Oh.

5977
03:07:48,300 --> 03:07:49,080
We're kind of close.

5978
03:07:49,180 --> 03:07:50,540
We're pretty far, but it's fine.

5979
03:07:50,580 --> 03:07:50,960
It's fun to run.

5980
03:07:50,960 --> 03:07:50,980
No.

5981
03:07:50,980 --> 03:07:51,880
I can see them fighting.

5982
03:07:52,840 --> 03:07:53,220
Thank you.

5983
03:07:54,380 --> 03:07:55,540
The girls are fighting.

5984
03:07:55,740 --> 03:07:56,880
The girls are fighting.

5985
03:07:58,140 --> 03:07:59,840
The bitches are shitting.

5986
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:00,960
Yay.

5987
03:08:01,640 --> 03:08:02,100
Oh, yeah.

5988
03:08:02,160 --> 03:08:03,080
Have you ever heard of that one?

5989
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:05,000
Are you a girl that poops or a bitch that shits?

5990
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:06,160
Are you a bitch that shits?

5991
03:08:06,200 --> 03:08:06,380
What?

5992
03:08:06,380 --> 03:08:08,740
It's like, are you a girl failure or a girl boss kind of vibe?

5993
03:08:08,840 --> 03:08:10,420
I am a bitch that shits.

5994
03:08:10,420 --> 03:08:14,540
I think I'm a girl boss, but my chat thinks I think is a girl failure.

5995
03:08:15,340 --> 03:08:15,840
You know what?

5996
03:08:16,020 --> 03:08:18,260
I'm inclined to agree, to an extent.

5997
03:08:18,280 --> 03:08:19,300
I think you're a little girl failure.

5998
03:08:19,880 --> 03:08:21,240
What do you mean by that, Haruka?

5999
03:08:21,300 --> 03:08:21,820
What do you mean by that?

6000
03:08:22,680 --> 03:08:23,280
Yeah, Haruka.

6001
03:08:23,580 --> 03:08:24,260
What do you mean by that?

6002
03:08:24,760 --> 03:08:26,320
You still look kind of suggestive.

6003
03:08:26,340 --> 03:08:31,120
I think someone should hold your hand sometimes, like right now.

6004
03:08:31,220 --> 03:08:32,900
I think she wants to hold your hand, Min.

6005
03:08:32,980 --> 03:08:34,520
I want to hold yours.

6006
03:08:34,620 --> 03:08:34,980
I want to hold yours.

6007
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:35,540
Awww.

6008
03:08:40,500 --> 03:08:42,600
I don't want to be an American.

6009
03:08:47,100 --> 03:08:48,220
And freeze.

6010
03:08:50,600 --> 03:08:52,920
I need you to take care of the butt man.

6011
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:58,960
What about if I died?

6012
03:08:59,740 --> 03:09:00,440
It's okay.

6013
03:09:00,540 --> 03:09:02,620
You didn't die because I fresh-bent.

6014
03:09:03,360 --> 03:09:05,020
Oh thank you.

6015
03:09:06,160 --> 03:09:07,620
I'm on his butt.

6016
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:09,300
I'm ready.

6017
03:09:09,580 --> 03:09:11,200
To distract him.

6018
03:09:13,620 --> 03:09:15,520
I don't want to be an American idiot.

6019
03:09:16,160 --> 03:09:17,380
Oh that's awkward.

6020
03:09:18,240 --> 03:09:19,160
That's awkward.

6021
03:09:20,300 --> 03:09:21,500
Oh that's weird.

6022
03:09:26,340 --> 03:09:27,300
Shut up.

6023
03:09:30,300 --> 03:09:31,020
It's okay.

6024
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:33,640
I'm okay.

6025
03:09:33,760 --> 03:09:35,100
You're okay.

6026
03:09:35,240 --> 03:09:35,620
You're fine.

6027
03:09:36,080 --> 03:09:37,440
There's some guys behind you.

6028
03:09:37,740 --> 03:09:38,340
Yeah I see.

6029
03:09:38,440 --> 03:09:39,600
Let me get the little guys behind you.

6030
03:09:39,680 --> 03:09:40,580
You just keep running away girl.

6031
03:09:40,780 --> 03:09:42,780
Oh there's a bug breed.

6032
03:09:42,980 --> 03:09:44,080
We should actually just run to them.

6033
03:09:45,520 --> 03:09:47,000
Let's run to them.

6034
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:48,320
Run to them.

6035
03:09:49,440 --> 03:09:50,880
He's like missing a leg.

6036
03:09:51,560 --> 03:09:52,220
Oh my god.

6037
03:09:52,240 --> 03:09:52,440
Please.

6038
03:09:52,620 --> 03:09:52,780
Please.

6039
03:09:57,360 --> 03:09:57,760
Idiot.

6040
03:09:57,760 --> 03:09:58,160
Dummy.

6041
03:09:58,360 --> 03:09:58,760
Stupid.

6042
03:09:59,200 --> 03:09:59,600
Stinky.

6043
03:09:59,600 --> 03:09:59,680
Stinky.

6044
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:05,640
Did I go too far?

6045
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:06,560
Did I go too far again?

6046
03:10:06,560 --> 03:10:07,340
I think you're doing fine.

6047
03:10:07,380 --> 03:10:08,340
Go towards them.

6048
03:10:08,920 --> 03:10:09,720
I'm really sorry.

6049
03:10:09,860 --> 03:10:10,440
I didn't mean to.

6050
03:10:10,560 --> 03:10:11,980
I take it back.

6051
03:10:12,040 --> 03:10:13,740
I regret my words and actions.

6052
03:10:14,100 --> 03:10:15,000
What did she say?

6053
03:10:15,840 --> 03:10:17,060
She said that you stink.

6054
03:10:23,100 --> 03:10:23,980
Hi guys.

6055
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:25,820
I'm here.

6056
03:10:26,460 --> 03:10:27,100
I'm here.

6057
03:10:27,280 --> 03:10:27,700
Yes.

6058
03:10:31,840 --> 03:10:32,500
I'm here.

6059
03:10:32,600 --> 03:10:34,540
By the way, we haven't done the main mission yet.

6060
03:10:34,660 --> 03:10:37,240
We've just been running around being little silly goofy girls.

6061
03:10:37,340 --> 03:10:39,220
I've been doing the main mission.

6062
03:10:39,520 --> 03:10:41,880
Have you done any of the main mission?

6063
03:10:42,180 --> 03:10:43,080
I don't think so.

6064
03:10:43,120 --> 03:10:43,800
I've done a ton.

6065
03:10:46,740 --> 03:10:47,900
We're getting together.

6066
03:10:48,600 --> 03:10:48,960
Yeah.

6067
03:10:49,460 --> 03:10:50,800
I also was here.

6068
03:10:50,920 --> 03:10:52,260
I came in like a little later.

6069
03:10:53,940 --> 03:10:55,880
You were here for the emotional support.

6070
03:10:56,240 --> 03:10:56,680
Yeah.

6071
03:10:58,260 --> 03:10:58,800
I was.

6072
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:00,640
I showed up.

6073
03:11:00,900 --> 03:11:01,500
I killed an egg.

6074
03:11:01,520 --> 03:11:01,620
I helped.

6075
03:11:03,800 --> 03:11:04,920
I killed an egg.

6076
03:11:04,980 --> 03:11:05,300
I helped.

6077
03:11:06,800 --> 03:11:07,520
I helped.

6078
03:11:07,960 --> 03:11:08,680
Shit, shit, shit.

6079
03:11:08,940 --> 03:11:09,780
You see that eagle?

6080
03:11:09,880 --> 03:11:10,320
Run, run, run.

6081
03:11:10,720 --> 03:11:12,040
I think you should go towards it.

6082
03:11:14,540 --> 03:11:15,180
Henya, you tried.

6083
03:11:15,400 --> 03:11:15,740
Surprise!

6084
03:11:17,120 --> 03:11:17,840
Happy birthday!

6085
03:11:19,860 --> 03:11:20,780
Oh, it was Henya.

6086
03:11:21,120 --> 03:11:22,420
Oh, she eagled you.

6087
03:11:23,200 --> 03:11:24,120
I didn't get eagled.

6088
03:11:25,140 --> 03:11:26,580
I mean, she tried to kill you.

6089
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:28,480
I'm happy about it.

6090
03:11:28,560 --> 03:11:30,220
See, I told you.

6091
03:11:31,220 --> 03:11:32,460
We're on difficulty five.

6092
03:11:32,480 --> 03:11:34,580
I think you underestimate my degeneracy.

6093
03:11:34,580 --> 03:11:37,200
I think you underestimate my degeneracy.

6094
03:11:37,940 --> 03:11:39,540
Oh, I definitely don't.

6095
03:11:39,600 --> 03:11:40,860
I'm gonna get the bug nest.

6096
03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:46,040
Actually, Haru, I might need assistance.

6097
03:11:46,240 --> 03:11:46,720
Actually, Haru, I might need assistance.

6098
03:11:47,120 --> 03:11:47,720
Actually, Haru, I might need assistance.

6099
03:11:47,720 --> 03:11:49,900
I only have a few grenades.

6100
03:11:50,100 --> 03:11:51,240
This is a really big one.

6101
03:11:52,340 --> 03:11:53,440
I have one grenade.

6102
03:11:53,560 --> 03:11:54,380
Oh, no, no, no.

6103
03:11:54,380 --> 03:11:57,520
I'm getting my resupplies real quick.

6104
03:11:58,100 --> 03:11:59,840
You already summoned the resupplies?

6105
03:11:59,980 --> 03:12:00,340
Are you okay?

6106
03:12:00,620 --> 03:12:00,860
I did.

6107
03:12:01,040 --> 03:12:02,380
Can somebody punch me?

6108
03:12:02,760 --> 03:12:05,600
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

6109
03:12:05,620 --> 03:12:06,640
What the heck?

6110
03:12:06,700 --> 03:12:07,900
This is a big bug nest.

6111
03:12:07,940 --> 03:12:09,000
Like, it's good experience.

6112
03:12:09,580 --> 03:12:10,520
I didn't know!

6113
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:12,860
Wait, you're inside the rock?

6114
03:12:13,420 --> 03:12:14,380
What the fuck?

6115
03:12:14,380 --> 03:12:15,940
Oh, yeah, it's a bug.

6116
03:12:17,420 --> 03:12:18,600
I'll blow up the rock.

6117
03:12:21,220 --> 03:12:21,800
Do it, do it, do it.

6118
03:12:21,800 --> 03:12:22,420
Okay, okay.

6119
03:12:24,020 --> 03:12:25,120
Wait, how do I...

6120
03:12:25,120 --> 03:12:25,560
Okay, hold on.

6121
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:28,040
I gotta make sure I don't die.

6122
03:12:29,560 --> 03:12:31,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't die, don't die.

6123
03:12:31,800 --> 03:12:32,460
You're in the rock.

6124
03:12:33,220 --> 03:12:34,900
Yeah, there's no way we can get you out of there.

6125
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:35,880
Blow up the rock!

6126
03:12:39,040 --> 03:12:40,320
That's one way to save her.

6127
03:12:41,160 --> 03:12:42,340
What the fuck, my bug?

6128
03:12:42,940 --> 03:12:44,240
Haru, Haru, Haru, come, come, come.

6129
03:12:44,760 --> 03:12:46,580
There's a big bug nest, but I don't have any grenades.

6130
03:12:47,820 --> 03:12:48,840
I have grenades.

6131
03:12:50,260 --> 03:12:51,380
There's a huge bug nest.

6132
03:12:52,200 --> 03:12:53,900
Like, eight holes left.

6133
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:57,360
Yeah, but this is two and there's like eight holes left, I think.

6134
03:12:57,540 --> 03:12:58,260
Well, you know what?

6135
03:12:58,580 --> 03:12:59,740
I'm good at filling holes.

6136
03:12:59,740 --> 03:13:00,460
I need your help.

6137
03:13:00,840 --> 03:13:02,680
Where is it?

6138
03:13:03,640 --> 03:13:04,340
You'll see, you'll see.

6139
03:13:04,420 --> 03:13:04,800
We're going to...

6140
03:13:04,800 --> 03:13:06,540
Where the bugs are coming from is where it is.

6141
03:13:06,600 --> 03:13:07,400
Oh, oh my goodness.

6142
03:13:10,040 --> 03:13:15,660
Oh my god, you speak Momo?

6143
03:13:16,500 --> 03:13:17,680
Does that how Momo speak?

6144
03:13:18,740 --> 03:13:19,680
That's Momo speak.

6145
03:13:19,780 --> 03:13:20,400
You speak Momo.

6146
03:13:22,500 --> 03:13:23,680
Fire in the hole!

6147
03:13:24,080 --> 03:13:24,720
You know what?

6148
03:13:24,840 --> 03:13:25,820
I can't aim!

6149
03:13:25,820 --> 03:13:26,340
I quit!

6150
03:13:27,180 --> 03:13:28,080
Oh my goodness.

6151
03:13:28,400 --> 03:13:28,760
Oh my goodness.

6152
03:13:31,560 --> 03:13:32,760
It's all Min's fault.

6153
03:13:32,860 --> 03:13:34,860
It's my fault?

6154
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:36,220
Yeah, it's all your fault.

6155
03:13:37,590 --> 03:13:38,220
You bitch.

6156
03:13:40,800 --> 03:13:42,300
She's happy to be the little villain.

6157
03:13:43,360 --> 03:13:43,940
She's happy to be the little villain.

6158
03:13:44,220 --> 03:13:48,200
Yeah, Min speaks your language.

6159
03:13:48,220 --> 03:13:49,280
That is so cute.

6160
03:13:49,280 --> 03:13:49,620
That is so cute.

6161
03:13:51,020 --> 03:13:52,660
That is so cute.

6162
03:13:53,740 --> 03:13:54,520
Is that it?

6163
03:13:54,560 --> 03:13:55,040
Oh, I see it.

6164
03:13:55,120 --> 03:13:56,600
The steam's coming up.

6165
03:13:57,340 --> 03:13:59,140
Yep, that's the hole you need to get rid of.

6166
03:13:59,800 --> 03:14:01,780
If I throw it from here, you think it'll reach?

6167
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:04,300
What's the worst that can happen?

6168
03:14:04,840 --> 03:14:05,540
You missed?

6169
03:14:05,840 --> 03:14:06,980
I think I missed.

6170
03:14:07,700 --> 03:14:08,300
Hold on.

6171
03:14:08,980 --> 03:14:09,640
Oh, Min.

6172
03:14:09,960 --> 03:14:11,140
You got this, Min.

6173
03:14:11,220 --> 03:14:11,740
I believe in you.

6174
03:14:11,740 --> 03:14:12,060
I got it!

6175
03:14:12,580 --> 03:14:13,500
Good job, Min!

6176
03:14:16,040 --> 03:14:17,120
Good job, girlies.

6177
03:14:17,120 --> 03:14:18,900
We have 23 minutes left.

6178
03:14:19,020 --> 03:14:19,680
Let's, uh...

6179
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:23,320
Let's remove...

6180
03:14:23,960 --> 03:14:26,940
as my grandparents used to say.

6181
03:14:27,300 --> 03:14:29,020
How do I tag the map again?

6182
03:14:29,180 --> 03:14:30,180
Can you remind me, Haruka?

6183
03:14:30,880 --> 03:14:32,580
Hold tab, and then you hold right click.

6184
03:14:33,100 --> 03:14:34,260
Oh, it's hold right click.

6185
03:14:34,300 --> 03:14:34,680
There we go.

6186
03:14:34,900 --> 03:14:36,800
You hold right click to move your mouse.

6187
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:37,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6188
03:14:37,980 --> 03:14:40,740
I'm gonna get some more ammo.

6189
03:14:41,560 --> 03:14:42,000
Oh, yeah?

6190
03:14:42,100 --> 03:14:42,380
Okay.

6191
03:14:42,440 --> 03:14:42,900
I'm coming.

6192
03:14:43,860 --> 03:14:44,300
Yeah.

6193
03:14:44,680 --> 03:14:45,120
Haru?

6194
03:14:47,580 --> 03:14:48,840
Can we get the ammo?

6195
03:14:49,180 --> 03:14:51,300
Oh, I already called it.

6196
03:14:51,420 --> 03:14:52,220
You already used all of it?

6197
03:14:53,220 --> 03:14:53,580
Me?

6198
03:14:53,720 --> 03:14:53,900
Oh.

6199
03:14:54,540 --> 03:14:56,260
Or you mean it didn't come down yet?

6200
03:14:56,440 --> 03:14:58,000
No, I just called it.

6201
03:14:58,980 --> 03:15:01,900
Haru, if you have your backpack, if she gets it, then we get one more.

6202
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:03,560
It's a little hack.

6203
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:04,820
It's a little gamer trick.

6204
03:15:04,820 --> 03:15:05,220
Oh, my gosh.

6205
03:15:05,300 --> 03:15:06,300
Why am I always climbing?

6206
03:15:07,240 --> 03:15:07,860
Oh, my God.

6207
03:15:10,240 --> 03:15:11,060
Leave me alone.

6208
03:15:12,100 --> 03:15:12,920
Yeah, I dropped it.

6209
03:15:12,920 --> 03:15:13,500
They're down here.

6210
03:15:13,540 --> 03:15:16,960
You see them?

6211
03:15:18,100 --> 03:15:18,900
Are you far?

6212
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:19,720
Is there a ping?

6213
03:15:19,840 --> 03:15:20,980
How do you ping in this game?

6214
03:15:21,400 --> 03:15:21,620
Q.

6215
03:15:21,700 --> 03:15:22,120
Q.

6216
03:15:24,680 --> 03:15:26,100
You're a cutie.

6217
03:15:26,860 --> 03:15:28,660
Oh, my God.

6218
03:15:29,160 --> 03:15:31,100
You need to stop it right now.

6219
03:15:31,100 --> 03:15:31,860
Let's run to the other eggs.

6220
03:15:32,080 --> 03:15:33,200
I have the Riz.

6221
03:15:33,680 --> 03:15:34,760
He is the Riz.

6222
03:15:35,800 --> 03:15:36,240
Riz.

6223
03:15:37,640 --> 03:15:39,120
Do you have any Riz mint?

6224
03:15:41,820 --> 03:15:42,920
Some would say yeah.

6225
03:15:43,740 --> 03:15:46,420
I like how Mata literally calls you out by laughing like that.

6226
03:15:47,120 --> 03:15:47,880
I would say yes.

6227
03:15:48,660 --> 03:15:49,780
My mom?

6228
03:15:49,940 --> 03:15:51,180
What are you talking about?

6229
03:15:51,580 --> 03:15:53,360
Why are you flirting with your mom?

6230
03:15:53,620 --> 03:15:54,720
Okay, Oedipus.

6231
03:15:55,560 --> 03:15:56,120
Oedipus?

6232
03:15:59,040 --> 03:16:01,300
I don't know how to say his name.

6233
03:16:01,360 --> 03:16:01,840
Oedipus.

6234
03:16:02,560 --> 03:16:03,120
Oedipus.

6235
03:16:06,400 --> 03:16:10,340
Why do you think making fun of somebody whose native language is in English is funny?

6236
03:16:10,620 --> 03:16:11,980
It's not even English.

6237
03:16:15,360 --> 03:16:15,920
Sorry.

6238
03:16:15,920 --> 03:16:16,620
You're getting cancelled.

6239
03:16:16,740 --> 03:16:18,300
I'm writing my tweet right now.

6240
03:16:20,180 --> 03:16:20,980
One second.

6241
03:16:21,400 --> 03:16:22,760
I'm writing my cancellation.

6242
03:16:23,620 --> 03:16:25,260
I'm writing my cancellation right now.

6243
03:16:25,640 --> 03:16:26,300
It's Greek.

6244
03:16:26,460 --> 03:16:26,820
I know.

6245
03:16:28,240 --> 03:16:28,920
Hold on.

6246
03:16:31,520 --> 03:16:32,120
Wait a minute.

6247
03:16:32,180 --> 03:16:33,000
I have to do this to me.

6248
03:16:34,020 --> 03:16:34,420
Mint.

6249
03:16:35,640 --> 03:16:38,920
Come over here and look at this and tell me what it looks like.

6250
03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:40,660
It looks like a little onion.

6251
03:16:41,400 --> 03:16:43,020
It looks like a bunch of onions.

6252
03:16:43,020 --> 03:16:43,560
Yeah.

6253
03:16:46,180 --> 03:16:46,580
Onions.

6254
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:48,840
A bunch of big onions.

6255
03:16:49,780 --> 03:16:50,440
Aw, shit.

6256
03:16:50,700 --> 03:16:51,280
The bugs are coming.

6257
03:16:51,740 --> 03:16:52,280
Oh, shit.

6258
03:16:52,380 --> 03:16:52,940
Oh, he missed me.

6259
03:16:53,740 --> 03:16:54,520
You know what, Mint?

6260
03:16:54,540 --> 03:16:55,980
This is me writing out my tweet longer right now.

6261
03:16:56,600 --> 03:16:57,300
I can't even.

6262
03:16:57,320 --> 03:16:57,940
What are you doing?

6263
03:16:57,940 --> 03:16:58,440
Where are you?

6264
03:16:58,640 --> 03:17:07,160
I can't even hear you over the bugs.

6265
03:17:07,500 --> 03:17:08,280
I can't even hear you over the bugs.

6266
03:17:08,300 --> 03:17:09,420
I can't even hear you over the bugs.

6267
03:17:09,420 --> 03:17:09,680
I can't even hear you over the bugs.

6268
03:17:09,920 --> 03:17:11,700
I'll wipe water for you.

6269
03:17:11,920 --> 03:17:12,320
I'll wipe water for you.

6270
03:17:13,020 --> 03:17:16,160
I can't believe we do something like this.

6271
03:17:16,580 --> 03:17:17,180
Unbelievable.

6272
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:20,460
What a terrible person and tweet.

6273
03:17:20,800 --> 03:17:21,020
What the fuck?

6274
03:17:22,600 --> 03:17:23,480
Oh, thank you.

6275
03:17:25,760 --> 03:17:27,200
We should run though.

6276
03:17:27,260 --> 03:17:28,160
There's a few chargers.

6277
03:17:28,520 --> 03:17:30,720
And charge these nuts.

6278
03:17:33,100 --> 03:17:34,580
You said it.

6279
03:17:34,580 --> 03:17:35,580
You said it.

6280
03:17:36,040 --> 03:17:39,360
Where did I die?

6281
03:17:40,500 --> 03:17:41,320
Over there.

6282
03:17:41,500 --> 03:17:43,000
You died like right over there.

6283
03:17:43,020 --> 03:17:44,100
You can see it on your map.

6284
03:17:44,220 --> 03:17:44,900
No, I know.

6285
03:17:45,100 --> 03:17:46,660
I just always say it out loud.

6286
03:17:46,940 --> 03:17:47,880
Oh, smart.

6287
03:17:48,440 --> 03:17:51,280
You know in puzzle games when you're like, what would I do if I was this?

6288
03:17:51,400 --> 03:17:52,520
And then somebody gives you the solution.

6289
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:54,160
You're like, no, no, I'm just thinking out loud.

6290
03:17:54,500 --> 03:17:55,920
Oh, wait, that's my body.

6291
03:17:57,180 --> 03:17:58,260
No, I totally get it.

6292
03:17:58,320 --> 03:18:01,100
I'm like, hey chat, here's the signal for you to ask questions.

6293
03:18:01,760 --> 03:18:03,100
I'm like, hey chat, blah, blah, blah.

6294
03:18:03,420 --> 03:18:03,780
Yeah.

6295
03:18:05,640 --> 03:18:06,900
It doesn't work though.

6296
03:18:07,240 --> 03:18:08,080
It doesn't work?

6297
03:18:08,720 --> 03:18:09,800
They never read.

6298
03:18:10,660 --> 03:18:12,480
You can have like no spoilers.

6299
03:18:13,020 --> 03:18:14,920
They never read what I'm speaking out of my mouth.

6300
03:18:15,080 --> 03:18:16,280
They won't listen.

6301
03:18:17,200 --> 03:18:19,940
They can't read my lips.

6302
03:18:20,360 --> 03:18:22,000
They can't read my lips.

6303
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:23,840
Read my lips.

6304
03:18:23,940 --> 03:18:25,240
Read my lips.

6305
03:18:25,480 --> 03:18:26,860
Words are hard.

6306
03:18:27,180 --> 03:18:28,240
Listening is harder.

6307
03:18:28,840 --> 03:18:29,640
I don't know.

6308
03:18:29,740 --> 03:18:31,540
I think the wisps are pretty good.

6309
03:18:32,720 --> 03:18:33,360
Oh yeah?

6310
03:18:34,280 --> 03:18:35,320
We'll see about that.

6311
03:18:35,480 --> 03:18:36,340
Play a puzzle game.

6312
03:18:36,380 --> 03:18:36,760
I dare you.

6313
03:18:36,960 --> 03:18:37,400
I have.

6314
03:18:38,780 --> 03:18:40,020
We played Doom Beans.

6315
03:18:40,040 --> 03:18:40,920
You know what you should do?

6316
03:18:41,060 --> 03:18:44,220
I play a game with my friend called Escape Room Similar.

6317
03:18:45,120 --> 03:18:46,580
Oh yeah, I've heard of that one.

6318
03:18:46,580 --> 03:18:47,760
Oh, I heard about that before.

6319
03:18:47,860 --> 03:18:48,620
I heard about that.

6320
03:18:48,920 --> 03:18:52,140
That's a great puzzler if you want to put your brain to the test.

6321
03:18:52,140 --> 03:18:53,160
Oh, that's a puzzle game.

6322
03:18:53,800 --> 03:18:55,840
Yeah, because it's like you're trying to escape from the room.

6323
03:18:55,900 --> 03:18:57,300
There's a bunch of puzzles for you to solve.

6324
03:18:57,440 --> 03:18:58,940
And I don't know why I can't go through.

6325
03:18:59,620 --> 03:19:00,340
Where are we going?

6326
03:19:00,540 --> 03:19:01,640
Giga and I played one of those.

6327
03:19:01,680 --> 03:19:02,760
It was so funny.

6328
03:19:03,440 --> 03:19:04,060
Oh, really?

6329
03:19:04,060 --> 03:19:08,000
Like those whatever, like we were here together type of vibes.

6330
03:19:08,060 --> 03:19:08,760
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

6331
03:19:09,100 --> 03:19:10,360
Oh my god, the bugs are here.

6332
03:19:10,420 --> 03:19:11,140
Oh, we are here.

6333
03:19:11,220 --> 03:19:12,100
I love that game.

6334
03:19:12,300 --> 03:19:14,420
The bugs are here.

6335
03:19:16,060 --> 03:19:17,300
Where are the bugs?

6336
03:19:18,780 --> 03:19:19,720
Oh, hello.

6337
03:19:19,960 --> 03:19:20,360
Hello.

6338
03:19:21,020 --> 03:19:21,460
Hello.

6339
03:19:23,540 --> 03:19:23,980
Hi.

6340
03:19:26,800 --> 03:19:29,840
I don't know why these bugs remind me of my cat.

6341
03:19:31,040 --> 03:19:31,480
Why?

6342
03:19:31,580 --> 03:19:32,120
I don't know.

6343
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:34,040
The way they crawl at me reminds me of my cat.

6344
03:19:34,060 --> 03:19:34,600
I think.

6345
03:19:34,720 --> 03:19:38,760
Are you saying your cat is a fucking demon from the hells?

6346
03:19:38,760 --> 03:19:39,120
Maybe.

6347
03:19:39,160 --> 03:19:41,220
Well, like cat like owner.

6348
03:19:41,540 --> 03:19:42,120
You know?

6349
03:19:42,780 --> 03:19:44,080
Are you a demon?

6350
03:19:44,140 --> 03:19:45,800
That means I raised him well.

6351
03:19:47,180 --> 03:19:49,980
You know they have those pictures of dogs that start looking like their owners?

6352
03:19:50,640 --> 03:19:51,360
Oh yeah.

6353
03:19:52,360 --> 03:19:55,660
If Mint's cat is misbehaving, you know why.

6354
03:19:56,040 --> 03:19:56,900
Hey everyone.

6355
03:19:57,180 --> 03:19:59,460
I'm going to open the extraction point.

6356
03:19:59,760 --> 03:20:00,760
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

6357
03:20:01,260 --> 03:20:02,640
Yeah, let's run to the extraction.

6358
03:20:04,840 --> 03:20:05,960
Mint, run towards me.

6359
03:20:06,040 --> 03:20:07,120
Run towards me, I can help.

6360
03:20:07,620 --> 03:20:08,480
Where is it?

6361
03:20:09,460 --> 03:20:10,120
It's behind you.

6362
03:20:10,960 --> 03:20:12,000
It's at the opposite side.

6363
03:20:12,120 --> 03:20:14,040
You can re-summon your stuff at the extraction point.

6364
03:20:14,440 --> 03:20:15,240
Oh, he killed himself.

6365
03:20:18,160 --> 03:20:19,580
They have a cooldown, right?

6366
03:20:20,820 --> 03:20:21,220
Thank you, thank you.

6367
03:20:21,220 --> 03:20:22,660
If you look right now, your stuff is going to have a cooldown.

6368
03:20:23,800 --> 03:20:25,240
Oh yeah, I can call them.

6369
03:20:25,480 --> 03:20:26,480
Yeah, you can call them again.

6370
03:20:26,580 --> 03:20:29,660
Usually what we do, as soon as you get to the...

6371
03:20:31,440 --> 03:20:32,160
Oh my god.

6372
03:20:32,160 --> 03:20:33,820
Not only playing Risk of Rain 2.

6373
03:20:34,480 --> 03:20:35,960
Of course he is.

6374
03:20:36,140 --> 03:20:37,500
Go to the blue.

6375
03:20:37,800 --> 03:20:39,400
And go to the blue.

6376
03:20:40,260 --> 03:20:41,440
My drone.

6377
03:20:41,880 --> 03:20:42,780
Blue, blue, blue.

6378
03:20:43,180 --> 03:20:44,880
We're going to the blue.

6379
03:20:45,520 --> 03:20:46,160
Do that!

6380
03:20:47,720 --> 03:20:49,120
Bienvenido, yummy, yummy.

6381
03:20:50,720 --> 03:20:51,740
Yummy, yummy.

6382
03:20:52,080 --> 03:20:53,020
Yummy, yummy.

6383
03:20:53,260 --> 03:20:54,160
Thank you, thank you.

6384
03:20:55,840 --> 03:20:57,040
Yummy, yummy.

6385
03:20:57,440 --> 03:20:58,580
Yummy, yummy.

6386
03:20:58,580 --> 03:20:59,360
Yummy, yummy.

6387
03:21:05,580 --> 03:21:06,800
One minute, one minute.

6388
03:21:06,920 --> 03:21:07,340
One minute.

6389
03:21:07,560 --> 03:21:08,520
Doing good, doing good.

6390
03:21:09,160 --> 03:21:10,740
Yeah, he just kind of looks like my cat.

6391
03:21:11,480 --> 03:21:12,440
When he does that.

6392
03:21:13,760 --> 03:21:15,800
I cannot wait to be the judge of that.

6393
03:21:16,480 --> 03:21:17,280
That's your...

6394
03:21:17,280 --> 03:21:19,440
Wait, that's your cat attack you like that?

6395
03:21:19,960 --> 03:21:20,360
No.

6396
03:21:22,460 --> 03:21:23,060
Why not?

6397
03:21:24,060 --> 03:21:24,580
Forkway, no.

6398
03:21:25,220 --> 03:21:26,480
I mean, sometimes.

6399
03:21:26,580 --> 03:21:29,200
I like how you've been saying Forkway because of me all the time.

6400
03:21:29,260 --> 03:21:31,960
I feel like I stole that one from you, yeah.

6401
03:21:32,540 --> 03:21:33,260
Yeah, that was Forkway.

6402
03:21:34,180 --> 03:21:36,340
But Fajitas de Polo was mine.

6403
03:21:36,740 --> 03:21:38,000
I've had that one.

6404
03:21:38,040 --> 03:21:39,480
That's been mine since forever.

6405
03:21:41,020 --> 03:21:41,880
Oh, uh-oh.

6406
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:43,000
Uh-oh.

6407
03:21:45,060 --> 03:21:45,760
Forkway, no.

6408
03:21:45,980 --> 03:21:48,020
Fajitas de Polo is mine and only mine.

6409
03:21:49,400 --> 03:21:50,580
I'm the only person...

6410
03:21:50,580 --> 03:21:51,040
Whoa!

6411
03:21:52,320 --> 03:21:53,540
Oh, nice kill!

6412
03:21:54,120 --> 03:21:54,560
Ah!

6413
03:21:55,920 --> 03:21:57,060
Hey, oh, sorry, man.

6414
03:21:57,100 --> 03:21:58,360
I should have warned you that was Flying Eagle.

6415
03:21:58,520 --> 03:21:59,140
That's okay.

6416
03:21:59,540 --> 03:22:01,320
I'm used to it by now because I'm a...

6417
03:22:02,540 --> 03:22:03,140
Oh, because of what?

6418
03:22:03,880 --> 03:22:06,040
Yeah, you heard me.

6419
03:22:06,520 --> 03:22:08,100
Because I'm a Tarakhan!

6420
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:09,780
Yeah, you heard me.

6421
03:22:09,800 --> 03:22:10,080
Uh-oh.

6422
03:22:10,080 --> 03:22:11,860
Yeah, you heard me.

6423
03:22:13,920 --> 03:22:14,880
I'm landing!

6424
03:22:15,440 --> 03:22:15,860
Uh-oh.

6425
03:22:15,860 --> 03:22:16,300
Uh-oh.

6426
03:22:20,620 --> 03:22:22,600
Can everybody get to the shuttle?

6427
03:22:22,680 --> 03:22:23,160
Which is fine?

6428
03:22:24,220 --> 03:22:25,820
I'm on my way!

6429
03:22:26,320 --> 03:22:26,900
Ouch!

6430
03:22:28,520 --> 03:22:29,640
I'm on my way!

6431
03:22:29,640 --> 03:22:30,660
Oh, uh...

6432
03:22:32,980 --> 03:22:33,860
Uh-oh.

6433
03:22:34,920 --> 03:22:35,360
Uh...

6434
03:22:35,940 --> 03:22:36,380
Uh...

6435
03:22:38,460 --> 03:22:38,900
Uh...

6436
03:22:38,900 --> 03:22:40,120
Anyone wanna res me?

6437
03:22:41,600 --> 03:22:41,800
Uh...

6438
03:22:41,800 --> 03:22:42,160
No!

6439
03:22:44,080 --> 03:22:48,200
No, I mean, I've got your samples, which is more important than your life, but that's all right!

6440
03:22:48,220 --> 03:22:51,420
Oh, actually, I was concerned about the samples, so, you know...

6441
03:22:51,420 --> 03:22:51,780
Oh, actually, I was concerned about the samples, so, you know...

6442
03:22:51,780 --> 03:22:53,120
Yeah, I got the samples.

6443
03:22:53,200 --> 03:22:54,280
Samples, everything.

6444
03:22:57,500 --> 03:22:59,620
It's okay because I left you guys last time.

6445
03:23:00,420 --> 03:23:02,220
Yeah, you kinda ditched us.

6446
03:23:02,400 --> 03:23:03,400
Now it's, uh...

6447
03:23:03,400 --> 03:23:04,500
Now it's...

6448
03:23:04,500 --> 03:23:05,520
It's even.

6449
03:23:06,800 --> 03:23:09,780
And we're all best buddies for it, you know?

6450
03:23:09,820 --> 03:23:11,740
I got you guys!

6451
03:23:11,740 --> 03:23:12,560
You guys got me!

6452
03:23:12,780 --> 03:23:13,760
No, no, no.

6453
03:23:13,900 --> 03:23:14,580
Who are you?

6454
03:23:17,220 --> 03:23:19,040
Oh my gosh, I love you guys!

6455
03:23:19,180 --> 03:23:19,940
Oh my gosh!

6456
03:23:21,060 --> 03:23:21,660
Oh my gosh!

6457
03:23:22,280 --> 03:23:24,240
I'm sorry, Mint, we have to kick you out.

6458
03:23:24,500 --> 03:23:27,320
I think Maus is coming online, so we want to make it...

6459
03:23:27,320 --> 03:23:27,540
Yeah, I'm sorry.

6460
03:23:32,120 --> 03:23:33,980
Do you know this Mint person?

6461
03:23:34,460 --> 03:23:35,480
No, no.

6462
03:23:35,980 --> 03:23:36,920
She's been, like...

6463
03:23:37,560 --> 03:23:39,580
following me around ever since I summoned her.

6464
03:23:39,740 --> 03:23:40,880
No, I mean, like...

6465
03:23:41,600 --> 03:23:43,100
I mean, like...

6466
03:23:43,620 --> 03:23:44,580
I mean...

6467
03:23:44,580 --> 03:23:45,420
Yeah.

6468
03:23:46,220 --> 03:23:49,240
This is so great, we're just one big happy family, you know?

6469
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:53,160
You're not a part of this family.

6470
03:23:53,160 --> 03:23:54,940
Look, I'm also in this picture!

6471
03:23:55,140 --> 03:23:56,320
There's also me too!

6472
03:23:57,460 --> 03:23:59,060
Your hand's popping out!

6473
03:24:00,280 --> 03:24:00,700
That's so funny!

6474
03:24:02,240 --> 03:24:03,300
That's so funny!

6475
03:24:03,380 --> 03:24:05,480
Haru, did you teach her how to buy guns and stuff?

6476
03:24:05,740 --> 03:24:06,080
Yeah.

6477
03:24:06,240 --> 03:24:07,840
Should we teach her so she tries different guns?

6478
03:24:07,980 --> 03:24:09,380
No, I can't afford them.

6479
03:24:09,660 --> 03:24:10,820
What about stratagems?

6480
03:24:11,380 --> 03:24:12,920
If you come where I am?

6481
03:24:13,400 --> 03:24:14,060
No, I know.

6482
03:24:14,380 --> 03:24:16,560
I bought the eagle.

6483
03:24:17,180 --> 03:24:17,580
No, I know.

6484
03:24:17,580 --> 03:24:17,580
I bought the eagle.

6485
03:24:17,580 --> 03:24:18,540
Okay, you can buy more stuff.

6486
03:24:18,800 --> 03:24:19,640
I don't have enough money!

6487
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:21,420
Oh wait, yes I do now.

6488
03:24:21,700 --> 03:24:24,140
You have enough money for chicken nuggets.

6489
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:27,500
Holy shit, I kinda want chicken nuggets.

6490
03:24:29,120 --> 03:24:31,620
Is the stalwart good?

6491
03:24:32,740 --> 03:24:34,440
Buy everything and then try them out.

6492
03:24:34,600 --> 03:24:35,300
Try every gun?

6493
03:24:35,540 --> 03:24:37,040
I only have 9000.

6494
03:24:37,780 --> 03:24:39,800
Oh yeah, you'll get more as we keep playing.

6495
03:24:40,200 --> 03:24:40,720
Okay.

6496
03:24:41,500 --> 03:24:45,220
My wife asked me to stop singing Wonderwall to her.

6497
03:24:45,320 --> 03:24:46,160
The stalwart is good?

6498
03:24:46,440 --> 03:24:46,900
I said, maybe.

6499
03:24:47,580 --> 03:24:47,880
Okay.

6500
03:24:48,560 --> 03:24:49,460
I like that.

6501
03:24:49,880 --> 03:24:50,660
Arc time!

6502
03:24:52,400 --> 03:24:53,880
Henya's about to be out for murder.

6503
03:24:54,600 --> 03:24:56,380
Yeah, I'm going for Arc Dio.

6504
03:24:57,180 --> 03:24:57,980
Arc Dio.

6505
03:24:58,840 --> 03:25:00,620
Oh, this is a 12 minute mission.

6506
03:25:00,780 --> 03:25:02,140
So this one we gotta go fast.

6507
03:25:03,360 --> 03:25:04,000
Yeah, Mata.

6508
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:05,400
You don't think she knows about the R menu?

6509
03:25:05,640 --> 03:25:05,660
Make sure we gotta go fast.

6510
03:25:07,520 --> 03:25:10,060
Mintzchat, has she been using R to buy guns?

6511
03:25:10,540 --> 03:25:12,340
What do you mean R to buy guns?

6512
03:25:13,080 --> 03:25:14,140
If you go into R.

6513
03:25:14,320 --> 03:25:15,400
Oh yeah, what do you mean R?

6514
03:25:15,400 --> 03:25:17,240
And then you go into Warbon, you see R?

6515
03:25:17,380 --> 03:25:17,860
Press R.

6516
03:25:18,240 --> 03:25:18,640
R.

6517
03:25:19,740 --> 03:25:21,360
Do you see it says Helldivers, mobilize.

6518
03:25:21,740 --> 03:25:22,280
Do you see that?

6519
03:25:22,480 --> 03:25:22,820
Yeah.

6520
03:25:23,880 --> 03:25:25,800
Okay, and now you can buy the guns in there.

6521
03:25:26,580 --> 03:25:27,820
Yeah, don't forget that!

6522
03:25:29,600 --> 03:25:34,340
I think if you keep going down, the gun that I'm using, it's on page 5 out of 8, it's called the Sight.

6523
03:25:34,500 --> 03:25:35,260
What did I get?

6524
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:36,160
I really like it.

6525
03:25:37,100 --> 03:25:41,220
I usually try to get the guns, the grenade, and the super credit.

6526
03:25:41,440 --> 03:25:44,760
Oh wait, I think I bought something on accident when I meant to... wait.

6527
03:25:45,280 --> 03:25:45,780
That's fine.

6528
03:25:46,900 --> 03:25:47,620
I thought...

6529
03:25:48,780 --> 03:25:54,600
So it's a battle pass, so basically you have to unlock some of the pages when you move down a page.

6530
03:25:55,100 --> 03:25:55,540
Basically.

6531
03:25:57,300 --> 03:26:01,020
So you didn't technically fuck off, you have to unlock the other things.

6532
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:03,200
Oh, I see, okay, I thought I was redeeming...

6533
03:26:03,200 --> 03:26:04,520
Oh my god, this is...

6534
03:26:04,520 --> 03:26:05,820
What's this thing?

6535
03:26:05,960 --> 03:26:06,760
A super credit?

6536
03:26:06,920 --> 03:26:07,800
I can't see... oh.

6537
03:26:08,020 --> 03:26:14,700
So super credits is like in-game currency, but you can find that shit in the overworld and get them from the battle pass too.

6538
03:26:14,900 --> 03:26:17,960
So it's super free to play friendly.

6539
03:26:18,420 --> 03:26:18,860
Nice!

6540
03:26:18,940 --> 03:26:20,740
Yeah, you just have to play a lot.

6541
03:26:21,480 --> 03:26:22,280
What's this one?

6542
03:26:22,800 --> 03:26:24,160
Yeah, it's not like...

6543
03:26:25,460 --> 03:26:26,780
141 hours of this game.

6544
03:26:27,480 --> 03:26:28,360
What's the...

6545
03:26:28,360 --> 03:26:31,040
What's the grenade that launches immediately?

6546
03:26:31,960 --> 03:26:35,440
Oh, that's called the high impact grenade and that's in several pages down.

6547
03:26:35,640 --> 03:26:38,660
I think I got the grenade.

6548
03:26:42,200 --> 03:26:43,340
I believe in you.

6549
03:26:47,480 --> 03:26:48,520
Oh, wait.

6550
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:50,120
The game is always free to play.

6551
03:26:50,740 --> 03:26:52,580
You can even collect super credits in-game.

6552
03:26:52,820 --> 03:26:55,240
Like, if you play a lot of hours, you don't have to spend money.

6553
03:26:56,260 --> 03:27:00,340
I mean, yeah, you spend money to buy the game for sure, but buying like the...

6554
03:27:00,340 --> 03:27:01,060
Yeah, yeah.

6555
03:27:02,900 --> 03:27:03,440
Come on.

6556
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:06,240
Gotta spend money for games.

6557
03:27:06,260 --> 03:27:06,760
How do I...

6558
03:27:07,220 --> 03:27:09,040
Oh, that's what you meant.

6559
03:27:09,180 --> 03:27:10,180
You have to buy the game.

6560
03:27:10,260 --> 03:27:10,620
Okay, okay.

6561
03:27:11,620 --> 03:27:15,980
Sometimes I've seen people come in chat be like, oh, is the game free on random games?

6562
03:27:16,100 --> 03:27:19,440
I'm like, why do you think it would be free?

6563
03:27:20,200 --> 03:27:20,720
Why do you think it would be free?

6564
03:27:20,740 --> 03:27:20,860
It could be.

6565
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:21,600
I don't know.

6566
03:27:21,700 --> 03:27:22,640
It could be, but why?

6567
03:27:23,040 --> 03:27:24,380
Wait, how do I change my...

6568
03:27:24,800 --> 03:27:26,340
How do I change my weapon and stuff?

6569
03:27:27,780 --> 03:27:28,620
Oh, we have to...

6570
03:27:29,200 --> 03:27:30,880
Oh, okay.

6571
03:27:32,520 --> 03:27:33,200
Come here.

6572
03:27:33,620 --> 03:27:39,800
Actually, you can change it during the mission, but if you come to this computer right here, and then you go into...

6573
03:27:39,800 --> 03:27:43,340
Two is armory, and then character, booster, you can like see everything.

6574
03:27:43,480 --> 03:27:46,040
So you can go into armory and then change your armor, change your stuff.

6575
03:27:46,040 --> 03:27:47,360
Oh, oh.

6576
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:48,460
Try this one.

6577
03:27:48,600 --> 03:27:49,420
Is it equipped?

6578
03:27:49,780 --> 03:27:51,520
You know what else you can change?

6579
03:27:52,660 --> 03:27:53,140
Everything.

6580
03:27:53,500 --> 03:27:53,980
Deez nuts.

6581
03:27:57,880 --> 03:27:58,520
She's gone.

6582
03:27:58,560 --> 03:27:59,200
We lost her.

6583
03:27:59,320 --> 03:28:00,280
We lost her.

6584
03:28:02,160 --> 03:28:05,020
Wait, but this one...

6585
03:28:05,020 --> 03:28:08,120
Oh, I guess this one has a longer fuse time.

6586
03:28:09,520 --> 03:28:10,000
Okay.

6587
03:28:12,360 --> 03:28:13,660
I kind of look like a bug.

6588
03:28:14,500 --> 03:28:14,820
Ooh.

6589
03:28:16,440 --> 03:28:16,760
Ooh.

6590
03:28:16,880 --> 03:28:18,960
Oh my god, my face.

6591
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:20,680
Oh yeah, Haru, what time did you go to sleep today?

6592
03:28:21,540 --> 03:28:23,040
I don't think you really want to know.

6593
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:23,840
Yeah, I do.

6594
03:28:23,900 --> 03:28:24,560
Is it 4pm?

6595
03:28:24,780 --> 03:28:26,140
Wait, where's the other gun that I got?

6596
03:28:26,420 --> 03:28:28,220
No, it was 1pm.

6597
03:28:28,760 --> 03:28:30,040
Do I have to order that one?

6598
03:28:30,140 --> 03:28:31,960
Some of the other guns, you have to order, like...

6599
03:28:31,960 --> 03:28:35,420
You know in game when you can put a gun to use, that you summon from the big crates?

6600
03:28:35,460 --> 03:28:37,160
Some of the guns you summon from the big crates.

6601
03:28:37,280 --> 03:28:40,500
So there's your primary weapon, which is like your regular gun.

6602
03:28:41,020 --> 03:28:43,040
Secondary weapon, which is like a little revolver.

6603
03:28:43,820 --> 03:28:45,400
And then you summon special guns.

6604
03:28:45,680 --> 03:28:47,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I figured the special gun.

6605
03:28:47,580 --> 03:28:48,120
I figured, yeah.

6606
03:28:48,600 --> 03:28:51,860
So the special guns, it just depends what you like to do.

6607
03:28:52,020 --> 03:28:52,200
Okay.

6608
03:28:52,320 --> 03:28:55,420
For me, I hate ammo, so I always try to get guns that don't use ammo.

6609
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:01,560
Wait, where's my other emote?

6610
03:29:01,980 --> 03:29:02,900
Oh wait, here we go.

6611
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:03,560
I ate it.

6612
03:29:10,340 --> 03:29:13,160
That's the most evil laugh I've ever heard from you, and I'm terrified for my life.

6613
03:29:13,560 --> 03:29:15,020
No, I've heard more emote.

6614
03:29:16,920 --> 03:29:21,280
But I go to bed tonight, and if I have a sleep paralysis, and I hear that evil laughter, I know it's too late.

6615
03:29:21,280 --> 03:29:22,600
I'm the sleep paralysis demon!

6616
03:29:23,060 --> 03:29:23,960
Coming to visit you.

6617
03:29:25,260 --> 03:29:25,620
Rah!

6618
03:29:26,380 --> 03:29:28,000
Wait, so are you a demon now or are you a ghost?

6619
03:29:28,000 --> 03:29:30,320
My sleep paralysis ghost can't be back to you.

6620
03:29:30,440 --> 03:29:32,480
No, I'm a ghost, I'm a ghost.

6621
03:29:33,400 --> 03:29:33,760
What?

6622
03:29:34,320 --> 03:29:35,340
Yeah, I was very confused.

6623
03:29:37,580 --> 03:29:39,820
Mata, your ritual was disturbing.

6624
03:29:40,540 --> 03:29:43,260
I don't know what I messed up in it, genuinely.

6625
03:29:44,460 --> 03:29:45,580
I don't know what I messed up in it, genuinely.

6626
03:29:48,880 --> 03:29:50,900
Okay, this mission is fast.

6627
03:29:51,560 --> 03:29:52,280
12 minutes.

6628
03:29:52,380 --> 03:29:54,080
We go in, we kill, we get out.

6629
03:29:54,620 --> 03:29:56,920
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

6630
03:29:57,900 --> 03:29:58,300
Boom.

6631
03:29:58,620 --> 03:29:59,400
I already forgot.

6632
03:29:59,680 --> 03:30:02,120
I already put the microwave on fire.

6633
03:30:02,200 --> 03:30:02,580
What are we doing?

6634
03:30:03,080 --> 03:30:04,460
We all scratched at once.

6635
03:30:07,180 --> 03:30:07,780
Instructions unclear.

6636
03:30:07,960 --> 03:30:09,040
I already blew up the house.

6637
03:30:11,900 --> 03:30:12,900
What do these do?

6638
03:30:16,480 --> 03:30:17,420
I don't know.

6639
03:30:17,520 --> 03:30:18,440
I don't know why that reminded me of that song.

6640
03:30:24,600 --> 03:30:27,020
I still have this game audio turned off.

6641
03:30:46,500 --> 03:30:47,780
Mint, you're getting it.

6642
03:30:47,860 --> 03:30:48,620
You get the vibe.

6643
03:30:49,400 --> 03:30:50,680
I think, I don't know.

6644
03:30:52,140 --> 03:30:53,160
It's still fun though.

6645
03:30:55,900 --> 03:30:56,720
Here we go.

6646
03:30:57,420 --> 03:30:59,220
Oh, yeah.

6647
03:31:00,520 --> 03:31:01,920
You get it, you get it.

6648
03:31:01,960 --> 03:31:02,620
That's our girl.

6649
03:31:03,620 --> 03:31:07,120
Run towards the red stuff, because that's where the holes are.

6650
03:31:07,440 --> 03:31:09,000
Close as many holes as you can.

6651
03:31:09,220 --> 03:31:09,520
Okay.

6652
03:31:10,720 --> 03:31:12,540
You know what else we can close the hole with?

6653
03:31:13,020 --> 03:31:13,700
A gun.

6654
03:31:15,040 --> 03:31:15,480
What?

6655
03:31:15,700 --> 03:31:17,520
You thought I was going to say these stuff.

6656
03:31:18,180 --> 03:31:20,500
No, I was not.

6657
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:22,440
I can't believe you thought.

6658
03:31:22,660 --> 03:31:23,100
What?

6659
03:31:23,160 --> 03:31:24,600
I don't even see red on the map.

6660
03:31:25,280 --> 03:31:25,980
I don't see it too.

6661
03:31:25,980 --> 03:31:27,180
Yeah, because it's sort of blocked off.

6662
03:31:28,600 --> 03:31:30,340
So the shitty thing about this gas.

6663
03:31:30,520 --> 03:31:32,800
It covers up the compass.

6664
03:31:32,900 --> 03:31:34,920
So we don't get to see anything.

6665
03:31:35,380 --> 03:31:37,200
So just run until you find a bus hole.

6666
03:31:37,200 --> 03:31:38,320
There's a friend by ourselves.

6667
03:31:40,260 --> 03:31:40,860
He's asleep.

6668
03:31:42,940 --> 03:31:44,000
Don't let him wake up.

6669
03:31:45,520 --> 03:31:46,500
Don't let him wake up.

6670
03:31:49,600 --> 03:31:50,740
Yeah, take that.

6671
03:31:53,140 --> 03:31:54,140
With the green bugs.

6672
03:31:54,300 --> 03:31:56,140
What's their place to shoot them in?

6673
03:31:56,380 --> 03:31:57,420
The face as well.

6674
03:31:59,060 --> 03:32:01,220
Because they're armored nursing stores.

6675
03:32:01,700 --> 03:32:02,580
Oh, they explode.

6676
03:32:03,020 --> 03:32:03,640
So they're more annoying.

6677
03:32:04,880 --> 03:32:06,020
You got to hit him in the face.

6678
03:32:08,800 --> 03:32:09,620
Oh my god.

6679
03:32:09,640 --> 03:32:10,400
Are you kidding me?

6680
03:32:10,700 --> 03:32:10,900
No.

6681
03:32:12,600 --> 03:32:13,480
Are you kidding?

6682
03:32:13,620 --> 03:32:15,240
No, I'm not joking around.

6683
03:32:16,760 --> 03:32:18,100
It is indeed a thing.

6684
03:32:19,320 --> 03:32:20,880
I can't tell if I'm hitting him or not.

6685
03:32:21,920 --> 03:32:22,560
Maybe I was.

6686
03:32:22,620 --> 03:32:24,300
This is the thing that exploded last time, right?

6687
03:32:24,420 --> 03:32:24,660
Yeah.

6688
03:32:27,760 --> 03:32:28,200
Beautiful.

6689
03:32:28,840 --> 03:32:29,720
Cover girl.

6690
03:32:31,540 --> 03:32:32,660
Give me the stupid sample.

6691
03:32:33,340 --> 03:32:34,060
Oh my god.

6692
03:32:34,100 --> 03:32:35,520
This is the stupidest sample ever.

6693
03:32:35,860 --> 03:32:36,700
What's the sample?

6694
03:32:36,840 --> 03:32:38,800
I like using the high impact grenade on them.

6695
03:32:38,960 --> 03:32:39,860
This pure...

6696
03:32:41,400 --> 03:32:42,660
They died in one hit.

6697
03:32:45,340 --> 03:32:47,520
10 minutes remaining already?

6698
03:32:47,660 --> 03:32:49,020
Yeah, this is a fast mission.

6699
03:32:49,160 --> 03:32:49,800
You just got to run.

6700
03:32:50,320 --> 03:32:51,680
I haven't found it yet.

6701
03:32:52,620 --> 03:32:54,400
Oh, I found one.

6702
03:32:55,140 --> 03:32:56,180
There's one there.

6703
03:32:59,060 --> 03:32:59,980
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

6704
03:33:01,880 --> 03:33:02,860
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

6705
03:33:03,640 --> 03:33:05,320
I found some hoes.

6706
03:33:08,640 --> 03:33:09,680
I'm putting down an eagle.

6707
03:33:09,700 --> 03:33:10,440
Did not come in here.

6708
03:33:10,660 --> 03:33:11,520
Oh, wait.

6709
03:33:11,640 --> 03:33:12,280
Putting down what?

6710
03:33:12,340 --> 03:33:14,180
I'm in somewhere.

6711
03:33:14,980 --> 03:33:15,620
Oh, okay.

6712
03:33:15,740 --> 03:33:16,480
I missed it.

6713
03:33:19,520 --> 03:33:20,380
There's a stalker.

6714
03:33:20,380 --> 03:33:21,260
He's invisible.

6715
03:33:21,440 --> 03:33:22,020
He's invisible.

6716
03:33:22,660 --> 03:33:24,820
That's a stalker.

6717
03:33:24,820 --> 03:33:25,400
I got it.

6718
03:33:25,400 --> 03:33:26,560
Those are annoying stalkers.

6719
03:33:26,660 --> 03:33:27,180
Oh, no.

6720
03:33:27,340 --> 03:33:29,340
I thought the stalkers come on harder difficulties.

6721
03:33:29,920 --> 03:33:31,320
Oh, is that the invisible one?

6722
03:33:31,660 --> 03:33:31,980
Yeah.

6723
03:33:32,740 --> 03:33:34,780
We just need three holes and we're done.

6724
03:33:34,940 --> 03:33:36,060
Wait, is this one over here?

6725
03:33:37,620 --> 03:33:39,140
Yeah, you see the stalkers coming out over here?

6726
03:33:39,280 --> 03:33:40,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6727
03:33:40,220 --> 03:33:41,220
I see, I see, I see.

6728
03:33:42,760 --> 03:33:43,480
Wow, you're right.

6729
03:33:43,560 --> 03:33:45,320
One impact grenade really does kill them.

6730
03:33:45,360 --> 03:33:45,820
That's crazy.

6731
03:33:46,320 --> 03:33:46,860
Oh my god.

6732
03:33:46,900 --> 03:33:47,360
Oh my god.

6733
03:33:47,360 --> 03:33:47,980
Oh my god.

6734
03:33:49,240 --> 03:33:50,280
We're doing amazing, Mint.

6735
03:33:51,200 --> 03:33:51,900
I'm so sorry, Mint.

6736
03:33:53,100 --> 03:33:54,000
She's not sorry.

6737
03:33:54,040 --> 03:33:55,060
She's doing it on purpose.

6738
03:33:55,140 --> 03:33:56,480
It's because you haunt her at night.

6739
03:33:56,900 --> 03:33:58,600
Oh my god.

6740
03:33:58,780 --> 03:33:59,780
Wait, where is it?

6741
03:33:59,860 --> 03:34:00,620
Where is the hole?

6742
03:34:01,080 --> 03:34:01,680
Oh my god.

6743
03:34:04,660 --> 03:34:05,920
Oh, I'm right next to it.

6744
03:34:06,020 --> 03:34:06,340
I'm right next to it.

6745
03:34:08,080 --> 03:34:08,620
I'm trying.

6746
03:34:09,280 --> 03:34:09,680
Oh.

6747
03:34:10,880 --> 03:34:11,460
Got it.

6748
03:34:12,100 --> 03:34:12,500
Alright.

6749
03:34:12,660 --> 03:34:15,940
Can someone reinforce me?

6750
03:34:16,180 --> 03:34:16,580
Okay.

6751
03:34:17,800 --> 03:34:19,380
Yeah, it's like a big white guy.

6752
03:34:19,460 --> 03:34:20,840
He's really, really scary.

6753
03:34:21,900 --> 03:34:22,960
Guys, you cannot outrun.

6754
03:34:23,080 --> 03:34:25,200
They will chase you to the end of the fucking map.

6755
03:34:25,660 --> 03:34:26,180
Oh no.

6756
03:34:27,420 --> 03:34:29,160
They're like obsessed with that.

6757
03:34:29,280 --> 03:34:29,660
Oh my god.

6758
03:34:31,600 --> 03:34:32,400
Uh oh.

6759
03:34:32,520 --> 03:34:32,760
Uh oh.

6760
03:34:33,720 --> 03:34:34,500
Hold on.

6761
03:34:37,160 --> 03:34:38,120
There we go.

6762
03:34:40,880 --> 03:34:42,240
I love impact grenades.

6763
03:34:42,360 --> 03:34:43,760
That's why I never want to switch them.

6764
03:34:44,100 --> 03:34:46,720
Oh man, I'm so far from my job.

6765
03:34:47,680 --> 03:34:48,080
Where?

6766
03:34:49,000 --> 03:34:50,560
We're just looking for...

6767
03:34:51,900 --> 03:34:52,620
Three more holes.

6768
03:34:54,480 --> 03:34:54,840
Yeah.

6769
03:34:54,840 --> 03:34:56,080
I clogged the first five.

6770
03:34:56,660 --> 03:34:57,180
Wait, no.

6771
03:34:57,260 --> 03:34:57,960
We need only one more.

6772
03:34:58,820 --> 03:34:59,260
Oh, yeah.

6773
03:34:59,340 --> 03:35:00,480
So we only need one more.

6774
03:35:00,500 --> 03:35:00,600
Oh, my bad.

6775
03:35:01,220 --> 03:35:01,740
Is that me?

6776
03:35:03,040 --> 03:35:03,660
Found something.

6777
03:35:04,900 --> 03:35:05,620
A sample.

6778
03:35:06,200 --> 03:35:07,780
How do you know what the combat is?

6779
03:35:09,300 --> 03:35:10,480
Oh, if you look at the map.

6780
03:35:10,540 --> 03:35:12,120
It's basically when you like get out of the map.

6781
03:35:12,620 --> 03:35:12,980
Ow.

6782
03:35:13,120 --> 03:35:13,440
Ow.

6783
03:35:13,760 --> 03:35:15,300
Is when you leave the combat zone.

6784
03:35:16,620 --> 03:35:17,140
What's this?

6785
03:35:17,740 --> 03:35:18,680
Is this a sample?

6786
03:35:19,180 --> 03:35:21,060
Arthios, you just have to type exclamation mark mint.

6787
03:35:21,200 --> 03:35:21,580
Not mint.

6788
03:35:23,480 --> 03:35:24,600
Just exclamation mark mint.

6789
03:35:24,900 --> 03:35:25,260
Me.

6790
03:35:25,340 --> 03:35:25,780
That's me.

6791
03:35:26,780 --> 03:35:27,500
Yeah, that's her.

6792
03:35:28,800 --> 03:35:29,780
Oh, that's not a bug hole.

6793
03:35:29,960 --> 03:35:30,320
That's a...

6794
03:35:30,320 --> 03:35:30,940
A mint.

6795
03:35:31,560 --> 03:35:32,160
A mint.

6796
03:35:32,720 --> 03:35:33,680
You got him, right, Haru?

6797
03:35:33,740 --> 03:35:34,180
Yeah, you got him.

6798
03:35:34,260 --> 03:35:34,620
A mint.

6799
03:35:35,420 --> 03:35:36,040
That's not me.

6800
03:35:36,100 --> 03:35:36,460
That's Henya.

6801
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:37,600
You got him, Henya.

6802
03:35:38,320 --> 03:35:39,020
I'm age two.

6803
03:35:39,060 --> 03:35:39,620
She's age four.

6804
03:35:40,680 --> 03:35:41,620
Yeah, I'm age four.

6805
03:35:41,620 --> 03:35:42,340
Not age two.

6806
03:35:42,400 --> 03:35:43,020
Nothing to worry about.

6807
03:35:43,020 --> 03:35:44,060
No, I'm age two.

6808
03:35:44,140 --> 03:35:44,720
She's age four.

6809
03:35:44,960 --> 03:35:46,760
Yeah, she's age two and I'm age four.

6810
03:35:47,720 --> 03:35:49,640
Yeah, I'm age two and she's age four.

6811
03:35:49,660 --> 03:35:51,860
Wait, oh, is that why we're M1 and M2?

6812
03:35:52,380 --> 03:35:53,420
Yeah, I'm age two and she's age four.

6813
03:35:53,480 --> 03:35:54,340
M1 reporting for duty.

6814
03:35:54,800 --> 03:35:56,260
Oh, I got a rare sample.

6815
03:35:57,380 --> 03:35:58,280
M1 and M3.

6816
03:35:58,940 --> 03:35:59,260
Yeah.

6817
03:36:00,340 --> 03:36:01,480
Oh, I see the other holes.

6818
03:36:01,560 --> 03:36:01,960
I see them.

6819
03:36:02,040 --> 03:36:02,320
I see them.

6820
03:36:02,320 --> 03:36:02,620
I see them.

6821
03:36:03,080 --> 03:36:04,220
I'm following you then.

6822
03:36:05,540 --> 03:36:05,860
M1.

6823
03:36:07,540 --> 03:36:08,380
M1 to M3, come with me.

6824
03:36:08,380 --> 03:36:08,880
Oh, I see it.

6825
03:36:08,900 --> 03:36:09,200
I see it.

6826
03:36:09,200 --> 03:36:09,780
I see it.

6827
03:36:09,800 --> 03:36:10,300
I see it.

6828
03:36:10,600 --> 03:36:12,560
Oh my god, there's three of them.

6829
03:36:14,020 --> 03:36:14,860
M1 to M3?

6830
03:36:15,880 --> 03:36:16,240
Yeah.

6831
03:36:16,920 --> 03:36:18,000
I'm going towards it.

6832
03:36:18,020 --> 03:36:18,780
I'm going to it.

6833
03:36:18,800 --> 03:36:19,260
I'm going to it.

6834
03:36:19,440 --> 03:36:21,140
No, don't go too close to it.

6835
03:36:21,200 --> 03:36:22,140
I sent a bomb.

6836
03:36:23,140 --> 03:36:23,500
Yeah.

6837
03:36:24,260 --> 03:36:26,280
Well, you could have said that like first night.

6838
03:36:26,920 --> 03:36:28,300
I said it.

6839
03:36:28,400 --> 03:36:30,060
No, you just said don't go close.

6840
03:36:31,500 --> 03:36:32,720
Well, I mean...

6841
03:36:32,720 --> 03:36:34,980
What do you think I would do when I first find the hole?

6842
03:36:35,340 --> 03:36:35,860
I don't know.

6843
03:36:35,900 --> 03:36:36,800
I would block it.

6844
03:36:36,940 --> 03:36:37,140
Uh oh.

6845
03:36:37,180 --> 03:36:37,840
Uh oh.

6846
03:36:38,320 --> 03:36:38,800
Uh oh.

6847
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:39,200
Uh oh.

6848
03:36:41,380 --> 03:36:42,380
Please let me out.

6849
03:36:42,480 --> 03:36:42,940
Let me out.

6850
03:36:42,960 --> 03:36:43,000
Please let me out.

6851
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:43,000
Let me out.

6852
03:36:43,660 --> 03:36:44,400
Let me out.

6853
03:36:44,700 --> 03:36:46,100
It's like the opposite of let me in.

6854
03:36:46,160 --> 03:36:46,700
Let me out.

6855
03:36:46,900 --> 03:36:47,560
Oh my god.

6856
03:36:47,580 --> 03:36:48,160
I'm going to die.

6857
03:36:48,300 --> 03:36:48,940
I'm going to die.

6858
03:36:50,100 --> 03:36:50,680
No, you won't.

6859
03:36:50,720 --> 03:36:51,060
You're going to live.

6860
03:36:53,160 --> 03:36:53,720
Oh my god.

6861
03:36:54,180 --> 03:36:55,620
You said I would live, you liar.

6862
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:56,780
I lied.

6863
03:36:57,040 --> 03:36:57,340
Fuck.

6864
03:36:57,420 --> 03:36:58,420
I accidentally got...

6865
03:36:58,900 --> 03:37:00,660
I accidentally took your gun and I...

6866
03:37:03,080 --> 03:37:03,800
My gun?

6867
03:37:04,000 --> 03:37:04,940
Can you revive them, Henya?

6868
03:37:05,760 --> 03:37:06,580
Okay, okay, okay.

6869
03:37:06,580 --> 03:37:06,940
Hold on.

6870
03:37:07,920 --> 03:37:11,000
Yeah, I accidentally picked up a different gun and then I couldn't switch.

6871
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:11,980
Help me.

6872
03:37:18,160 --> 03:37:19,320
Henya, no pressure.

6873
03:37:20,560 --> 03:37:21,900
Well, I already killed it.

6874
03:37:22,040 --> 03:37:22,780
Good girl.

6875
03:37:23,900 --> 03:37:26,300
I meant no pressure, like hurry up.

6876
03:37:27,720 --> 03:37:28,240
Oh.

6877
03:37:28,920 --> 03:37:30,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6878
03:37:30,640 --> 03:37:31,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6879
03:37:31,500 --> 03:37:33,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6880
03:37:34,040 --> 03:37:35,820
There's a lot of bugs.

6881
03:37:36,120 --> 03:37:36,520
Oh gosh.

6882
03:37:36,640 --> 03:37:37,060
Oh god.

6883
03:37:37,120 --> 03:37:38,340
Oh, I'm going to die again.

6884
03:37:38,740 --> 03:37:38,980
Okay.

6885
03:37:41,000 --> 03:37:41,680
Don't die.

6886
03:37:42,880 --> 03:37:44,300
I was killed by nothing.

6887
03:37:44,540 --> 03:37:45,260
I just died.

6888
03:37:47,380 --> 03:37:48,400
That's what they all say.

6889
03:37:49,520 --> 03:37:50,000
Nice.

6890
03:37:50,160 --> 03:37:52,160
It just said killed by blank.

6891
03:37:53,700 --> 03:37:55,140
Oh, maybe that's a weird bug.

6892
03:37:55,720 --> 03:37:57,240
Killed by blank.

6893
03:37:57,260 --> 03:37:58,440
I don't think I've seen that before.

6894
03:37:59,320 --> 03:38:00,420
I've seen it a few times.

6895
03:38:01,060 --> 03:38:02,060
How did I miss?

6896
03:38:02,320 --> 03:38:03,140
Oh my god.

6897
03:38:03,200 --> 03:38:04,340
How could you miss that?

6898
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:05,920
How could you miss that?

6899
03:38:05,980 --> 03:38:07,160
It was right in front of you.

6900
03:38:07,300 --> 03:38:09,740
It was right in front of you.

6901
03:38:09,740 --> 03:38:11,300
How did you miss?

6902
03:38:11,840 --> 03:38:12,420
How did you miss?

6903
03:38:12,420 --> 03:38:15,740
I have performance anxiety when everybody's looking.

6904
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:16,840
I feel weird.

6905
03:38:17,360 --> 03:38:18,020
I felt that.

6906
03:38:18,080 --> 03:38:19,820
I'm getting deja vu.

6907
03:38:19,840 --> 03:38:22,320
You said this shit to me a month ago.

6908
03:38:22,820 --> 03:38:23,720
Which one?

6909
03:38:24,380 --> 03:38:25,580
That performance anxiety.

6910
03:38:26,240 --> 03:38:28,440
I told you everyone's watching you do the arrow game.

6911
03:38:28,520 --> 03:38:29,560
They're like, no, stop.

6912
03:38:29,660 --> 03:38:30,380
I have performance anxiety.

6913
03:38:30,840 --> 03:38:31,240
I do.

6914
03:38:31,340 --> 03:38:31,780
It's true.

6915
03:38:32,300 --> 03:38:33,720
Please turn the lights off.

6916
03:38:36,440 --> 03:38:37,660
I'm dead, by the way.

6917
03:38:38,500 --> 03:38:41,400
I thought you were already dead because you're a ghost and everything.

6918
03:38:41,640 --> 03:38:42,900
I thought you were already dead because you're a ghost and everything.

6919
03:38:42,900 --> 03:38:43,500
I'm so fine.

6920
03:38:43,500 --> 03:38:46,740
By the way, you should try not dying in this game so that you can do damage.

6921
03:38:47,060 --> 03:38:47,220
By the way, you should try not dying in this game so that you can do damage.

6922
03:38:47,220 --> 03:38:48,500
Yeah, that's a good plan.

6923
03:38:50,120 --> 03:38:50,920
I'll try that.

6924
03:38:50,980 --> 03:38:51,580
That's like a subtle diss.

6925
03:38:53,020 --> 03:38:54,320
I don't think it's subtle.

6926
03:38:54,480 --> 03:38:55,480
I don't think it's a subtle diss.

6927
03:38:55,660 --> 03:38:57,660
That was very subtle.

6928
03:38:59,820 --> 03:39:01,420
Where is the extraction?

6929
03:39:01,680 --> 03:39:02,300
Oh, I see the extraction.

6930
03:39:02,620 --> 03:39:03,920
Okay, let's run to the extraction.

6931
03:39:04,300 --> 03:39:06,380
I say let's run.

6932
03:39:06,420 --> 03:39:07,640
Meanwhile, you guys are already there.

6933
03:39:08,900 --> 03:39:11,060
She told me to run, but I was already there.

6934
03:39:11,680 --> 03:39:12,920
I'm on my way.

6935
03:39:13,580 --> 03:39:15,560
You're closer to me.

6936
03:39:16,460 --> 03:39:16,900
Friendship door.

6937
03:39:17,860 --> 03:39:18,720
Oh, friendship door.

6938
03:39:18,820 --> 03:39:19,180
Where are you?

6939
03:39:19,220 --> 03:39:19,580
I'm calling.

6940
03:39:19,880 --> 03:39:20,440
I'm calling.

6941
03:39:21,940 --> 03:39:22,940
Baby can't see.

6942
03:39:23,880 --> 03:39:27,000
Did someone get my rare sample that I dropped?

6943
03:39:27,500 --> 03:39:27,580
Did someone get my rare sample that I dropped?

6944
03:39:27,760 --> 03:39:28,460
I got them.

6945
03:39:28,540 --> 03:39:28,800
Don't worry.

6946
03:39:28,880 --> 03:39:29,360
I picked them up.

6947
03:39:29,480 --> 03:39:30,260
Okay, thank you.

6948
03:39:30,580 --> 03:39:32,340
I got you, bitch.

6949
03:39:33,040 --> 03:39:33,700
Thank you.

6950
03:39:35,200 --> 03:39:37,260
Do you want to do friendship with Haruka?

6951
03:39:37,980 --> 03:39:39,000
I've done it before.

6952
03:39:39,400 --> 03:39:40,420
Yeah, I meant that I've already done it.

6953
03:39:40,500 --> 03:39:41,720
Friendship ended with Haruka.

6954
03:39:43,320 --> 03:39:45,240
Everything ended with Haruka.

6955
03:39:45,340 --> 03:39:46,120
No, I've got it.

6956
03:39:48,000 --> 03:39:49,820
The friendship has been rekindled.

6957
03:39:49,820 --> 03:39:51,260
The friendship has been rekindled.

6958
03:39:52,140 --> 03:39:52,840
Okay, hit it.

6959
03:39:52,880 --> 03:39:53,520
They really did it.

6960
03:39:54,480 --> 03:39:54,880
Yeah!

6961
03:39:55,140 --> 03:39:56,420
And now I'll proceed to push you.

6962
03:39:56,520 --> 03:39:57,080
Oh, thanks.

6963
03:39:57,720 --> 03:39:59,280
What was that?

6964
03:40:01,100 --> 03:40:05,100
Guys, I don't know how to tell you this, but we should probably help Hanya.

6965
03:40:05,100 --> 03:40:06,880
Yeah, could you?

6966
03:40:07,160 --> 03:40:07,980
No.

6967
03:40:10,080 --> 03:40:12,320
I think Hanya's got this.

6968
03:40:13,080 --> 03:40:13,900
Guys!

6969
03:40:14,620 --> 03:40:15,440
Guys!

6970
03:40:17,400 --> 03:40:17,680
Help!

6971
03:40:18,790 --> 03:40:19,820
I got you, Hanya.

6972
03:40:20,040 --> 03:40:20,320
I got you.

6973
03:40:20,320 --> 03:40:21,300
What's the big explosion?

6974
03:40:21,700 --> 03:40:22,420
Run.

6975
03:40:23,480 --> 03:40:25,700
I got you, baby girl.

6976
03:40:25,840 --> 03:40:26,800
I'm running.

6977
03:40:27,720 --> 03:40:28,540
No!

6978
03:40:29,640 --> 03:40:33,300
I came to your rescue.

6979
03:40:33,300 --> 03:40:35,340
M has come to...

6980
03:40:37,280 --> 03:40:38,260
The rescue.

6981
03:40:40,060 --> 03:40:40,620
Oh!

6982
03:40:41,100 --> 03:40:45,420
I tried to dodge, but I just did it silly.

6983
03:40:45,420 --> 03:40:45,500
It's okay.

6984
03:40:46,320 --> 03:40:47,880
One day you'll learn how to dodge.

6985
03:40:48,160 --> 03:40:49,540
And I'll be really proud.

6986
03:40:49,720 --> 03:40:50,380
I'm offense.

6987
03:40:50,480 --> 03:40:51,300
I'm not defense.

6988
03:40:53,260 --> 03:40:54,520
You know what they say.

6989
03:40:55,780 --> 03:40:57,120
Offense is the best defense.

6990
03:40:57,120 --> 03:40:57,900
Best defense!

6991
03:40:58,140 --> 03:40:58,620
Yeah!

6992
03:41:01,160 --> 03:41:01,720
Oh!

6993
03:41:03,300 --> 03:41:03,480
What the?

6994
03:41:03,660 --> 03:41:04,760
Where did he come from?

6995
03:41:05,420 --> 03:41:06,680
Where did he come from?

6996
03:41:06,680 --> 03:41:07,400
Where did he go?

6997
03:41:07,560 --> 03:41:08,700
Where did he come from?

6998
03:41:09,480 --> 03:41:10,520
Hanya killed me.

6999
03:41:10,740 --> 03:41:11,900
She's been married a long time ago.

7000
03:41:12,320 --> 03:41:14,940
Must be game glitch.

7001
03:41:14,940 --> 03:41:15,900
Oh, game glitch.

7002
03:41:15,980 --> 03:41:16,480
Game glitch.

7003
03:41:16,620 --> 03:41:17,320
Must be.

7004
03:41:17,340 --> 03:41:17,760
Must be.

7005
03:41:21,200 --> 03:41:22,080
Ten seconds.

7006
03:41:22,120 --> 03:41:22,560
Ten seconds.

7007
03:41:24,820 --> 03:41:25,900
Let me in.

7008
03:41:26,580 --> 03:41:27,020
Let me in.

7009
03:41:27,020 --> 03:41:28,060
Don't leave without me.

7010
03:41:28,840 --> 03:41:29,720
Let me in.

7011
03:41:30,580 --> 03:41:31,020
Hi.

7012
03:41:34,180 --> 03:41:35,000
Let me in.

7013
03:41:36,620 --> 03:41:37,560
Preparing for touchdown.

7014
03:41:37,940 --> 03:41:38,900
Preparing for touchdown.

7015
03:41:40,520 --> 03:41:41,540
Arriving at LZ.

7016
03:41:42,880 --> 03:41:49,420
So, Mint, every time I play with Zen, when we're all running into the ship, she just punches me as I'm about to run into the ship.

7017
03:41:49,500 --> 03:41:50,380
Every time.

7018
03:41:51,260 --> 03:41:52,460
Yep, she does that.

7019
03:41:52,500 --> 03:41:53,800
Every single time.

7020
03:41:53,880 --> 03:41:54,460
That's for Zen.

7021
03:41:54,680 --> 03:41:55,260
She what?

7022
03:41:57,160 --> 03:41:57,760
It's fine.

7023
03:41:58,200 --> 03:41:58,720
It's fine.

7024
03:41:58,720 --> 03:41:59,740
I deserve it.

7025
03:42:03,080 --> 03:42:05,960
Were you about to push somebody off the ship?

7026
03:42:06,100 --> 03:42:08,480
When you were telling that story?

7027
03:42:08,880 --> 03:42:09,340
Yes.

7028
03:42:10,160 --> 03:42:11,320
What about my story?

7029
03:42:11,900 --> 03:42:14,060
What did I do?

7030
03:42:14,360 --> 03:42:16,460
You were about to push somebody off the ship, weren't you?

7031
03:42:16,480 --> 03:42:17,460
When you were telling that story.

7032
03:42:17,740 --> 03:42:19,220
I deserved it.

7033
03:42:19,300 --> 03:42:22,240
I deserved it because I died.

7034
03:42:22,660 --> 03:42:23,560
What happened?

7035
03:42:23,860 --> 03:42:25,200
You deserved it because you died?

7036
03:42:25,200 --> 03:42:28,180
You only deserved it because you were about to do something.

7037
03:42:29,260 --> 03:42:30,060
You only deserved it because you were about to do something.

7038
03:42:30,060 --> 03:42:30,580
Troll me, weren't you?

7039
03:42:31,880 --> 03:42:32,920
Troll me?

7040
03:42:32,940 --> 03:42:34,900
If I wanted to troll, I wouldn't explain.

7041
03:42:35,160 --> 03:42:36,040
Troll Kana Kahn?

7042
03:42:36,580 --> 03:42:37,460
Troll Kana.

7043
03:42:37,740 --> 03:42:39,200
Troll Tara Kahn.

7044
03:42:42,620 --> 03:42:44,980
Or as Hanya would say, Kuntaram.

7045
03:42:46,280 --> 03:42:46,800
Kuntaram.

7046
03:42:49,880 --> 03:42:50,900
Mint's like, stop.

7047
03:42:50,980 --> 03:42:52,640
You're ruining my whole sheet.

7048
03:42:54,120 --> 03:42:54,960
My channel.

7049
03:42:55,200 --> 03:42:58,160
All my streams get demonetized anyway.

7050
03:42:59,600 --> 03:43:01,400
All my streams get demonetized anyway.

7051
03:43:01,400 --> 03:43:02,100
All of them?

7052
03:43:02,220 --> 03:43:02,980
On YouTube?

7053
03:43:03,120 --> 03:43:03,460
For real?

7054
03:43:03,660 --> 03:43:06,140
A good bit have been recently, yeah.

7055
03:43:06,260 --> 03:43:07,060
What have you been saying?

7056
03:43:07,200 --> 03:43:08,220
What kind of shenanigans?

7057
03:43:09,260 --> 03:43:11,840
It's like a music stuff that happens.

7058
03:43:13,440 --> 03:43:14,260
It's like a music stuff that happens.

7059
03:43:14,260 --> 03:43:14,560
So stupid.

7060
03:43:15,020 --> 03:43:17,540
Have you considered not playing copyrighted music?

7061
03:43:17,940 --> 03:43:26,320
No, it's because channels will upload music from games No, it's because channels will upload music from games and then even though they're not the actual owner of the music and then even though they're not the actual owner of the music and then they'll claim my videos.

7062
03:43:26,820 --> 03:43:28,540
Oh yeah, that happened.

7063
03:43:28,780 --> 03:43:30,180
I had that happen too.

7064
03:43:30,400 --> 03:43:31,900
One time I put like Bach.

7065
03:43:32,180 --> 03:43:38,740
I actually looked up classical like no copyright music and I got like 15 or something claims for that.

7066
03:43:38,800 --> 03:43:39,520
And I said no more.

7067
03:43:39,620 --> 03:43:41,920
You guys are getting BGM and nothing else.

7068
03:43:42,540 --> 03:43:43,840
Yeah, it's so awful.

7069
03:43:44,340 --> 03:43:45,320
It happens.

7070
03:43:45,420 --> 03:43:47,320
That's why I like to use video game music a lot.

7071
03:43:48,260 --> 03:43:52,300
You have to be careful because sometimes like what she just said that channels will...

7072
03:43:52,300 --> 03:43:52,480
Yeah.

7073
03:43:55,380 --> 03:44:01,400
Maybe because I stream on Twitch and I know that playing games with the BGM music seems fine.

7074
03:44:03,660 --> 03:44:10,160
That was my point saying if it's okay to play the game with the BGM then it should be okay.

7075
03:44:11,420 --> 03:44:12,900
That is really dumb.

7076
03:44:13,460 --> 03:44:14,280
It's silly.

7077
03:44:15,640 --> 03:44:16,600
It happens.

7078
03:44:18,360 --> 03:44:21,240
How do y'all feel about that being the last game?

7079
03:44:22,680 --> 03:44:24,600
You want more?

7080
03:44:25,280 --> 03:44:28,720
Because I've been streaming for 8 and a half hours and I have a big day tomorrow.

7081
03:44:29,040 --> 03:44:32,360
I also have to eat my lunch so I think that's a good time.

7082
03:44:32,420 --> 03:44:32,660
Yeah.

7083
03:44:33,940 --> 03:44:34,780
Lunch time.

7084
03:44:35,220 --> 03:44:36,380
What are you going to eat, Penia?

7085
03:44:37,480 --> 03:44:38,120
Sandwich today?

7086
03:44:38,940 --> 03:44:39,620
I don't know.

7087
03:44:39,720 --> 03:44:40,860
Maybe onigiri I guess.

7088
03:44:41,260 --> 03:44:41,680
Okay.

7089
03:44:42,220 --> 03:44:44,180
And you're not fucking sharing with the class.

7090
03:44:45,560 --> 03:44:46,280
What was it?

7091
03:44:47,300 --> 03:44:48,720
You're not going to share this with the class.

7092
03:44:49,060 --> 03:44:49,480
Yes.

7093
03:44:50,840 --> 03:44:51,260
No.

7094
03:44:52,520 --> 03:44:59,920
After all the deaths that we've died and all the people, all the books that we've killed and stuff.

7095
03:45:00,160 --> 03:45:01,000
You're not going to share it?

7096
03:45:01,960 --> 03:45:02,400
Okay.

7097
03:45:02,400 --> 03:45:03,120
I understand.

7098
03:45:03,680 --> 03:45:04,560
Have a nice day.

7099
03:45:04,800 --> 03:45:07,100
This is me posing with my Oshii.

7100
03:45:08,920 --> 03:45:11,620
Well let me just run through and ruin it.

7101
03:45:11,640 --> 03:45:11,860
Hey!

7102
03:45:11,860 --> 03:45:13,140
Stop ruining my picture!

7103
03:45:13,220 --> 03:45:15,620
Get out of my picture!

7104
03:45:15,720 --> 03:45:16,840
Get out of my picture!

7105
03:45:16,840 --> 03:45:17,500
My photo!

7106
03:45:18,820 --> 03:45:20,460
My photo is not even!

7107
03:45:20,580 --> 03:45:22,040
My photo is not even!

7108
03:45:24,340 --> 03:45:25,280
I'm in the middle!

7109
03:45:25,400 --> 03:45:25,880
I'm in the middle!

7110
03:45:25,960 --> 03:45:26,120
Me!

7111
03:45:26,180 --> 03:45:26,560
Me!

7112
03:45:26,560 --> 03:45:26,840
Me!

7113
03:45:26,840 --> 03:45:27,000
No!

7114
03:45:27,840 --> 03:45:28,380
Me!

7115
03:45:28,480 --> 03:45:28,900
Me!

7116
03:45:28,900 --> 03:45:29,180
Me!

7117
03:45:34,840 --> 03:45:39,300
She loves me.

7118
03:45:43,240 --> 03:45:46,780
You'll never have another You'll never have another hug again.

7119
03:45:48,340 --> 03:45:49,120
Anya, can I have one?

7120
03:45:49,700 --> 03:45:50,880
Gonna dance again.

7121
03:45:56,300 --> 03:45:57,600
I'm too slow.

7122
03:45:58,980 --> 03:46:00,500
That was so much fun though.

7123
03:46:00,940 --> 03:46:01,160
Yeah.

7124
03:46:01,320 --> 03:46:03,240
It was so nice to catch up again, Min.

7125
03:46:04,640 --> 03:46:05,040
Yeah.

7126
03:46:05,040 --> 03:46:06,280
Thank you for today.

7127
03:46:07,160 --> 03:46:07,560
Yeah.

7128
03:46:08,640 --> 03:46:09,700
I had a lot of fun.

7129
03:46:09,760 --> 03:46:10,740
I hope you learned a lot, Min.

7130
03:46:10,820 --> 03:46:12,360
If you ever want to play again, let us know.

7131
03:46:12,360 --> 03:46:14,300
You might now at least know how to play the game.

7132
03:46:14,780 --> 03:46:15,180
Yeah.

7133
03:46:15,260 --> 03:46:16,220
This game is really fun.

7134
03:46:16,260 --> 03:46:17,100
I like it a lot.

7135
03:46:18,120 --> 03:46:20,060
It was so nice to catch up with you, Min.

7136
03:46:20,560 --> 03:46:20,960
Yeah!

7137
03:46:23,060 --> 03:46:24,480
Let's play again soon.

7138
03:46:25,160 --> 03:46:25,560
Yeah!

7139
03:46:25,560 --> 03:46:26,420
I'm so down.

7140
03:46:26,660 --> 03:46:29,460
I want to play I forgot the name.

7141
03:46:29,500 --> 03:46:32,020
The zombie shooting one that we were talking about earlier.

7142
03:46:32,140 --> 03:46:32,640
Left 4 Dead?

7143
03:46:32,640 --> 03:46:33,240
Left 4 Dead 2.

7144
03:46:33,560 --> 03:46:33,960
Yeah!

7145
03:46:34,020 --> 03:46:35,360
I want to play that one too.

7146
03:46:36,060 --> 03:46:37,340
I'm so down for Left 4 Dead.

7147
03:46:37,460 --> 03:46:38,580
That was really fun.

7148
03:46:38,820 --> 03:46:39,660
That'll be fun.

7149
03:46:39,700 --> 03:46:40,320
That'll be fun.

7150
03:46:40,660 --> 03:46:41,480
We get all the mods.

7151
03:46:42,760 --> 03:46:43,640
I'm always around.

7152
03:46:43,980 --> 03:46:46,220
But if you also want to invite other people, I'm cool.

7153
03:46:46,500 --> 03:46:47,800
I got a busy time.

7154
03:46:48,000 --> 03:46:49,680
So keep me in mind.

7155
03:46:50,100 --> 03:46:50,540
Yeah.

7156
03:46:50,720 --> 03:46:51,020
Whatever.

7157
03:46:51,440 --> 03:46:53,440
I never think about you.

7158
03:46:54,080 --> 03:46:54,520
Okay.

7159
03:46:54,520 --> 03:46:56,080
We're recording tomorrow, I think.

7160
03:46:58,680 --> 03:46:59,980
In case you forgot about me.

7161
03:46:59,980 --> 03:47:01,720
We have to keep up the action.

7162
03:47:02,360 --> 03:47:02,900
Oh yeah.

7163
03:47:02,920 --> 03:47:03,360
You're right.

7164
03:47:03,400 --> 03:47:04,540
I hate you.

7165
03:47:04,800 --> 03:47:05,240
Yeah.

7166
03:47:05,240 --> 03:47:05,620
I hate you.

7167
03:47:06,060 --> 03:47:06,720
Bye guys!

7168
03:47:06,980 --> 03:47:07,940
Thanks for gaming!

7169
03:47:08,160 --> 03:47:08,620
Bye bye!

7170
03:47:09,580 --> 03:47:11,020
Have a good game!

7171
03:47:12,360 --> 03:47:12,700
Bye!

7172
03:47:13,900 --> 03:47:14,860
Good night!

7173
03:47:15,860 --> 03:47:16,960
Good night!

7174
03:47:18,060 --> 03:47:18,960
See you later!

7175
03:47:20,600 --> 03:47:21,200
Bye bye!

7176
03:47:23,040 --> 03:47:23,640
Wow.

7177
03:47:25,260 --> 03:47:25,860
What?

7178
03:47:26,600 --> 03:47:27,140
Who's still here?

7179
03:47:27,560 --> 03:47:28,460
It's just me.

7180
03:47:28,840 --> 03:47:29,680
It's just us?

7181
03:47:30,080 --> 03:47:33,720
I usually like to be the person that opens the door for everyone to leave first.

7182
03:47:34,520 --> 03:47:39,220
I just didn't open Discord quickly enough.

7183
03:47:39,220 --> 03:47:39,380
No.

7184
03:47:40,320 --> 03:47:40,940
It's okay.

7185
03:47:41,280 --> 03:47:45,480
It was so nice to see you again, Min.

7186
03:47:45,660 --> 03:47:46,020
Yeah!

7187
03:47:48,140 --> 03:47:49,160
Let's play again soon.

7188
03:47:49,940 --> 03:47:50,520
Hell yeah.

7189
03:47:50,920 --> 03:47:52,060
I'll leave the door first.

7190
03:47:52,160 --> 03:47:53,020
You can hold the door this time.

7191
03:47:53,140 --> 03:47:53,380
Okay.

7192
03:47:53,420 --> 03:47:54,560
I'm holding it for you, madam.

7193
03:47:55,540 --> 03:47:56,260
Thank you.

7194
03:47:56,340 --> 03:47:57,120
I love you, Min.

7195
03:47:57,160 --> 03:47:57,560
Love you!

7196
03:47:57,760 --> 03:47:58,340
Bye bye!

7197
03:47:58,980 --> 03:47:59,540
Bye bye!

7198
03:47:59,980 --> 03:48:00,700
By the way, you smell.

7199
03:48:03,260 --> 03:48:04,540
She ain't wrong.

7200
03:48:05,680 --> 03:48:06,260
I don't know.

7201
03:48:06,260 --> 03:48:06,440
Maybe.

7202
03:48:08,040 --> 03:48:09,000
Oh my gosh.

7203
03:48:09,120 --> 03:48:10,480
My brain is so...

7204
03:48:15,200 --> 03:48:16,240
I'm so tired.

7205
03:48:16,720 --> 03:48:17,380
Hello, madam.

7206
03:48:17,560 --> 03:48:21,800
If you see this message, that means that the gifted train has subsided.

7207
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:24,000
I hope you're having fun gaming.

7208
03:48:26,000 --> 03:48:26,940
Oh my gosh.

7209
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:27,600
I just realized.

7210
03:48:27,720 --> 03:48:28,300
Was there like...

7211
03:48:28,300 --> 03:48:31,420
Was there like notifications popping up the whole time?

7212
03:48:31,800 --> 03:48:33,760
Big Boss has become a member!

7213
03:48:34,880 --> 03:48:35,760
Welcome back!

7214
03:48:39,260 --> 03:48:41,280
You forgot to kill robots.

7215
03:48:41,540 --> 03:48:43,040
Oh, we didn't get to kill the robots.

7216
03:48:45,680 --> 03:48:47,760
Actually, I have no idea how many members...

7217
03:48:49,400 --> 03:48:50,680
Holy moly!

7218
03:48:55,690 --> 03:48:56,970
Holy moly!

7219
03:48:59,010 --> 03:49:01,470
Why are there so many?

7220
03:49:02,010 --> 03:49:02,650
Why are there so many?

7221
03:49:07,160 --> 03:49:08,200
Why are there so many?

7222
03:49:08,220 --> 03:49:08,520
What the...

7223
03:49:10,020 --> 03:49:10,800
Like 20.

7224
03:49:13,080 --> 03:49:14,540
Why did there be so...

7225
03:49:14,540 --> 03:49:16,840
Why did the membership bomb?

7226
03:49:17,960 --> 03:49:19,760
Sorry if I was so bad at the game.

7227
03:49:19,880 --> 03:49:21,580
But, you know, first time playing.

7228
03:49:21,740 --> 03:49:22,440
But it was a lot of fun.

7229
03:49:22,600 --> 03:49:24,440
Matar was so helpful trying to like...

7230
03:49:24,440 --> 03:49:25,180
I mean, sometimes.

7231
03:49:26,520 --> 03:49:34,580
But there's like so much of the game that even I think if you like explain as much as you can, you are gonna forget something.

7232
03:49:34,700 --> 03:49:35,280
You know what I mean?

7233
03:49:35,320 --> 03:49:35,920
Like you're gonna...

7234
03:49:36,660 --> 03:49:38,200
You're gonna be like, oh, I forgot.

7235
03:49:38,220 --> 03:49:41,600
Oh, I should've... I should've talked about this or I should've mentioned this.

7236
03:49:42,180 --> 03:49:42,840
Who's this?

7237
03:49:46,940 --> 03:49:48,920
What a rush indeed.

7238
03:49:51,300 --> 03:49:51,840
You...

7239
03:49:57,560 --> 03:49:59,980
Yes, thank you.

7240
03:50:01,480 --> 03:50:02,560
Manage democracy...

7241
03:50:02,560 --> 03:50:03,340
Wait, to our enemies?

7242
03:50:03,720 --> 03:50:04,600
Wait a second.

7243
03:50:06,160 --> 03:50:07,480
What do you mean by that?

7244
03:50:08,220 --> 03:50:09,640
Welcome to the bridge, Helldiver.

7245
03:50:09,920 --> 03:50:10,540
Thank you.

7246
03:50:11,640 --> 03:50:12,660
La la la.

7247
03:50:14,920 --> 03:50:15,280
Wow.

7248
03:50:16,900 --> 03:50:18,420
This game is pretty though.

7249
03:50:18,580 --> 03:50:19,360
It's actually very pretty.

7250
03:50:20,020 --> 03:50:21,640
When I say that, I hope you're doing well.

7251
03:50:21,700 --> 03:50:23,100
I've not been able to super chat in a bit.

7252
03:50:23,180 --> 03:50:23,920
I wanna give you some money.

7253
03:50:25,500 --> 03:50:28,460
That's a-okay if you have not been able to super chat.

7254
03:50:28,560 --> 03:50:29,900
Please don't ever feel bad.

7255
03:50:30,160 --> 03:50:30,360
Okay?

7256
03:50:30,440 --> 03:50:31,260
Please, please, please.

7257
03:50:32,460 --> 03:50:35,100
What a cool way to watch you play Doom today.

7258
03:50:39,630 --> 03:50:40,370
Oh my gosh.

7259
03:50:40,650 --> 03:50:41,130
You know what?

7260
03:50:41,130 --> 03:50:43,370
I can see Doom guy in this a little bit.

7261
03:50:43,830 --> 03:50:45,330
Oh my gosh, look how cool- wait.

7262
03:50:47,390 --> 03:50:50,090
I'm trying to get a good angle like on the other- here we go.

7263
03:50:50,570 --> 03:50:50,930
Wait.

7264
03:50:51,690 --> 03:50:52,210
Stop, stop.

7265
03:50:53,590 --> 03:50:54,650
Like look how pretty.

7266
03:50:55,750 --> 03:50:56,250
Hold on.

7267
03:50:57,590 --> 03:50:59,190
I'm gonna get rid of all of us.

7268
03:51:04,450 --> 03:51:05,170
Even me.

7269
03:51:06,510 --> 03:51:07,610
It's so pretty.

7270
03:51:09,470 --> 03:51:12,510
I feel like a Doom collab with this game though would be perfect.

7271
03:51:12,690 --> 03:51:13,850
Like you have- Oh my gosh.

7272
03:51:14,150 --> 03:51:24,370
Can you imagine running from the Coco Demon and like um having like the guys and stuff.

7273
03:51:24,850 --> 03:51:25,790
That'd be awesome.

7274
03:51:25,910 --> 03:51:27,650
Actually I feel like- oh my god.

7275
03:51:27,790 --> 03:51:29,050
That would be so awesome.

7276
03:51:30,910 --> 03:51:33,050
This is a very Doom Eternal screenshot.

7277
03:51:36,230 --> 03:51:36,830
Hold on.

7278
03:51:36,870 --> 03:51:38,210
Actually I can be next to him.

7279
03:51:40,050 --> 03:51:41,090
What am I doing?

7280
03:51:42,690 --> 03:51:45,430
Stopping myself from...

7281
03:51:45,430 --> 03:51:46,210
Oh.

7282
03:51:46,350 --> 03:51:46,810
Oh.

7283
03:51:50,810 --> 03:51:51,270
Uh...

7284
03:51:51,270 --> 03:51:52,550
I have to do this.

7285
03:51:57,410 --> 03:52:00,250
I don't know how tall- He said seven foot so...

7286
03:52:01,490 --> 03:52:04,490
How tall would I be next to someone who's seven foot?

7287
03:52:16,070 --> 03:52:16,530
Lower?

7288
03:52:16,990 --> 03:52:17,450
Lower.

7289
03:52:17,730 --> 03:52:18,090
Lower?

7290
03:52:20,370 --> 03:52:21,070
Like here?

7291
03:52:21,550 --> 03:52:21,910
No.

7292
03:52:22,030 --> 03:52:23,070
I think like here.

7293
03:52:26,170 --> 03:52:27,030
Did you like the game?

7294
03:52:27,090 --> 03:52:27,310
Yes!

7295
03:52:27,370 --> 03:52:28,430
I had so much fun!

7296
03:52:29,210 --> 03:52:29,870
It's a lot.

7297
03:52:29,990 --> 03:52:31,210
It's definitely like...

7298
03:52:31,890 --> 03:52:32,550
What's the word?

7299
03:52:34,370 --> 03:52:44,230
It's not a game that I think I could play for like- I mean I played for four hours almost today but it's not a game I think I could do for so much just because it's like everything overload.

7300
03:52:44,630 --> 03:52:47,650
Like it's like there's this guy coming over here.

7301
03:52:47,750 --> 03:52:52,310
You know it's just a little bit of a battery overload in a bit of way but um...

7302
03:52:53,550 --> 03:52:55,050
You would be at his waist?

7303
03:52:55,230 --> 03:52:55,950
No I would not!

7304
03:52:57,150 --> 03:52:58,250
No I would not.

7305
03:52:58,890 --> 03:53:00,510
You guys I'm not that small.

7306
03:53:01,550 --> 03:53:03,330
Yeah it's a tense game for sure.

7307
03:53:03,630 --> 03:53:04,630
But it's so fun.

7308
03:53:05,630 --> 03:53:06,730
It's nice with friends.

7309
03:53:06,930 --> 03:53:07,110
Yeah!

7310
03:53:07,430 --> 03:53:08,050
I can see.

7311
03:53:08,310 --> 03:53:12,010
I think by myself I would be like um...

7312
03:53:12,010 --> 03:53:18,090
You know I would get a little I mean I already got overwhelmed but um...it's still a lot of fun.

7313
03:53:22,570 --> 03:53:24,110
Around the tummy and chest.

7314
03:53:24,370 --> 03:53:24,910
Wait, so...

7315
03:53:27,450 --> 03:53:28,250
Like this.

7316
03:53:30,470 --> 03:53:31,290
This is me.

7317
03:53:31,890 --> 03:53:34,050
Don't talk to me or my son ever again.

7318
03:53:34,390 --> 03:53:36,370
Let me also bring out my other arm.

7319
03:53:37,070 --> 03:53:39,310
I only have one arm up.

7320
03:53:41,190 --> 03:53:41,910
There we go.

7321
03:53:45,790 --> 03:53:46,790
Is it great today?

7322
03:53:46,930 --> 03:53:49,970
Just do image training of venom snake diving away from enemies.

7323
03:53:50,090 --> 03:53:50,370
Yeah!

7324
03:53:50,450 --> 03:53:51,330
That's the one thing.

7325
03:53:51,450 --> 03:53:52,030
It was the diving.

7326
03:53:52,410 --> 03:53:53,310
It's because it's alt.

7327
03:53:53,390 --> 03:53:54,790
I might rebind it to be honest.

7328
03:53:54,830 --> 03:53:56,030
To be like space or something.

7329
03:53:56,310 --> 03:53:57,930
Cause you don't use space for anything.

7330
03:53:58,790 --> 03:53:59,230
Right?

7331
03:54:00,110 --> 03:54:01,210
Not that I know of.

7332
03:54:01,810 --> 03:54:05,550
But it being alt just like messes up my fingers.

7333
03:54:10,830 --> 03:54:12,270
I put it on shift.

7334
03:54:14,290 --> 03:54:16,290
Oh, well you use it for climbing.

7335
03:54:16,670 --> 03:54:17,890
Unless you're running.

7336
03:54:17,930 --> 03:54:18,530
That's true.

7337
03:54:18,770 --> 03:54:19,410
Yes, yes.

7338
03:54:19,490 --> 03:54:19,870
That's true.

7339
03:54:19,910 --> 03:54:20,250
That's true.

7340
03:54:21,210 --> 03:54:21,650
Yeah.

7341
03:54:21,870 --> 03:54:22,630
Vaulting is space.

7342
03:54:24,530 --> 03:54:26,570
Then I'll figure it out.

7343
03:54:26,610 --> 03:54:28,650
I'll rebind it to something that isn't so...

7344
03:54:29,550 --> 03:54:31,110
I use extra mouse buttons.

7345
03:54:31,210 --> 03:54:32,270
That's a good idea too.

7346
03:54:32,450 --> 03:54:34,010
Like the side ones.

7347
03:54:36,870 --> 03:54:37,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7348
03:54:39,030 --> 03:54:41,690
Mouse wheel for climbing?

7349
03:54:43,210 --> 03:54:43,750
What?

7350
03:54:43,750 --> 03:54:44,290
Really?

7351
03:54:47,350 --> 03:54:48,670
Is that normal?

7352
03:54:54,010 --> 03:54:54,930
Is that normal?

7353
03:54:58,420 --> 03:54:59,980
Seems... I don't know if I like that.

7354
03:55:03,400 --> 03:55:05,720
I do dive more than vaulting.

7355
03:55:05,800 --> 03:55:06,500
That's true.

7356
03:55:07,120 --> 03:55:09,800
I need something that I can like click really quickly, you know?

7357
03:55:09,820 --> 03:55:13,240
To get up and dive and get up and dive and get up and dive.

7358
03:55:14,460 --> 03:55:15,780
This game has stealth?

7359
03:55:16,200 --> 03:55:16,680
What?

7360
03:55:16,720 --> 03:55:17,180
When you crawl?

7361
03:55:20,320 --> 03:55:21,440
That would make sense.

7362
03:55:21,520 --> 03:55:23,400
Cause there is crawling and stuff.

7363
03:55:26,480 --> 03:55:27,100
But yeah.

7364
03:55:27,180 --> 03:55:30,060
Hopefully you guys have fun watching our chaos.

7365
03:55:30,960 --> 03:55:34,100
We had a bit of friendly banter.

7366
03:55:35,020 --> 03:55:40,020
You know, like I said, just a big happy family blowing each other up.

7367
03:55:41,100 --> 03:55:46,620
You know, when she calls me a bitch, it's like... I know it's out of love.

7368
03:55:47,080 --> 03:55:49,480
When I shoot her in the head, it's out of love.

7369
03:55:49,480 --> 03:55:52,900
Thank you for the five gifts and thank you.

7370
03:55:53,560 --> 03:55:54,880
A lot of screaming.

7371
03:55:55,660 --> 03:55:55,920
Yeah.

7372
03:55:55,980 --> 03:55:56,400
Oh my gosh.

7373
03:55:56,420 --> 03:55:57,360
It's almost midnight for me.

7374
03:56:01,360 --> 03:56:02,660
You're pretty good.

7375
03:56:03,000 --> 03:56:04,140
Yeah, it was fun though.

7376
03:56:04,220 --> 03:56:04,920
It was lots of fun.

7377
03:56:06,320 --> 03:56:08,580
Would like to... Oh, I'm lagging.

7378
03:56:08,680 --> 03:56:10,320
Would like to play again sometime.

7379
03:56:10,720 --> 03:56:12,040
But tomorrow...

7380
03:56:13,140 --> 03:56:16,340
Tomorrow is sexy time.

7381
03:56:17,740 --> 03:56:18,580
Oh my gosh.

7382
03:56:18,620 --> 03:56:20,680
I can't wait to play the bunny girls.

7383
03:56:20,760 --> 03:56:22,640
I'm a big fan of curate games.

7384
03:56:24,040 --> 03:56:30,320
So, when I saw that this was coming out... Rather, when I saw that it came out, I was like, oh, I should definitely play it.

7385
03:56:31,300 --> 03:56:37,420
But then I saw it getting so popular and I was like, now I have even more reason to play it.

7386
03:56:38,920 --> 03:56:40,900
I love curate games though.

7387
03:56:40,940 --> 03:56:41,920
They're so awesome.

7388
03:56:42,460 --> 03:56:43,920
Time for limited monetization.

7389
03:56:44,380 --> 03:56:45,060
That's okay.

7390
03:56:45,320 --> 03:56:46,680
Did you ever play Dream C Club?

7391
03:56:47,160 --> 03:56:47,880
Oh my god.

7392
03:56:49,620 --> 03:56:52,780
When I saw this, I was like, this game is Dream C Club.

7393
03:56:53,160 --> 03:56:54,300
I saw... Oh my gosh.

7394
03:56:54,860 --> 03:56:56,700
It is so funny that you mentioned that.

7395
03:56:56,780 --> 03:57:00,020
I was like... Because, yes, I have played Dream C Club.

7396
03:57:00,760 --> 03:57:04,020
And I'm like, someone else... Oh my gosh.

7397
03:57:04,160 --> 03:57:04,520
Sorry.

7398
03:57:04,680 --> 03:57:05,180
I'm so...

7399
03:57:09,580 --> 03:57:12,960
I saw it... When I saw this game, I was just like, it's just Dream C Club.

7400
03:57:13,160 --> 03:57:15,220
But like... But, you know...

7401
03:57:15,220 --> 03:57:16,340
Oh my god.

7402
03:57:19,680 --> 03:57:20,800
Thank you.

7403
03:57:20,940 --> 03:57:21,920
That made my night.

7404
03:57:26,140 --> 03:57:30,960
Oh my gosh.

7405
03:57:31,000 --> 03:57:33,580
I played so much Dream C Club.

7406
03:57:35,520 --> 03:57:36,440
So, yes.

7407
03:57:36,480 --> 03:57:38,380
When I saw this game, I was very excited.

7408
03:57:38,380 --> 03:57:39,100
Yeah.

7409
03:57:41,040 --> 03:57:43,320
My reaction to Zoombini's... Yeah.

7410
03:57:43,400 --> 03:57:44,180
Me too though.

7411
03:57:44,260 --> 03:57:44,660
Me too.

7412
03:57:48,660 --> 03:57:50,840
But... I've played most of Maid of the Dead.

7413
03:57:52,200 --> 03:57:54,080
I think you'd have fun with that one too.

7414
03:57:54,220 --> 03:57:55,520
I do want to play that one too.

7415
03:57:55,660 --> 03:57:56,680
I want to play Maid of the Dead.

7416
03:57:57,880 --> 03:58:03,960
I know Trouble Days went popular... went kind of mainstream.

7417
03:58:03,960 --> 03:58:04,400
Mainstream?

7418
03:58:04,600 --> 03:58:05,020
Not mainstream.

7419
03:58:05,360 --> 03:58:08,300
It was popular amongst VTubers some time ago.

7420
03:58:09,300 --> 03:58:16,020
I was thinking of playing maybe Prison Princess because it's kind of like a hidden objects game, but not really.

7421
03:58:16,460 --> 03:58:17,560
It's like a point and click.

7422
03:58:17,800 --> 03:58:18,960
I don't know.

7423
03:58:19,580 --> 03:58:20,680
Curate Marathon.

7424
03:58:21,340 --> 03:58:21,860
Yeah.

7425
03:58:24,440 --> 03:58:26,660
This game really reminded me of Left 4 Dead though.

7426
03:58:26,880 --> 03:58:27,300
Really?

7427
03:58:30,680 --> 03:58:32,400
Doki Doki Literature Club.

7428
03:58:32,540 --> 03:58:33,240
I played that.

7429
03:58:33,240 --> 03:58:35,040
Just the VOD is...

7430
03:58:38,220 --> 03:58:38,920
privated.

7431
03:58:38,920 --> 03:58:41,000
It went Maidstream.

7432
03:58:41,280 --> 03:58:47,100
Speaking of Maids, I started watching Akiba Maid Wars.

7433
03:58:47,760 --> 03:58:49,380
I've been watching that.

7434
03:58:49,640 --> 03:58:52,020
I watched the first three episodes of that.

7435
03:58:52,120 --> 03:58:56,280
I've been watching the Konosuba anime season 3.

7436
03:58:57,400 --> 03:59:00,920
I've been watching Blue Archive.

7437
03:59:01,820 --> 03:59:02,520
Um...

7438
03:59:03,380 --> 03:59:03,880
So...

7439
03:59:05,660 --> 03:59:07,240
That show is wild.

7440
03:59:07,400 --> 03:59:07,620
Yeah!

7441
03:59:07,760 --> 03:59:08,920
It feels like...

7442
03:59:09,840 --> 03:59:11,240
It feels like...

7443
03:59:12,840 --> 03:59:14,400
Maids meets Kakegurui.

7444
03:59:17,660 --> 03:59:19,100
Or something like that.

7445
03:59:19,360 --> 03:59:20,740
Are you watching Dungeon Meshi?

7446
03:59:20,840 --> 03:59:21,260
No!

7447
03:59:21,320 --> 03:59:22,680
I want to start that one too though.

7448
03:59:22,920 --> 03:59:24,000
I want to start that one too.

7449
03:59:28,060 --> 03:59:29,600
Blue Archive Mahjong.

7450
03:59:29,600 --> 03:59:30,160
Let's go!

7451
03:59:30,720 --> 03:59:32,200
It's the only reason...

7452
03:59:32,200 --> 03:59:35,600
It's the only reason I'm playing so I can maybe pull...

7453
03:59:37,020 --> 03:59:38,320
Who all is in?

7454
03:59:38,400 --> 03:59:39,380
Actually, let me check.

7455
03:59:39,520 --> 03:59:42,080
I saw that Shiroko was in it.

7456
03:59:44,500 --> 03:59:46,800
Blue Archive Mahjong.

7457
03:59:49,400 --> 03:59:49,860
So...

7458
03:59:49,860 --> 03:59:50,760
Uh...

7459
03:59:51,360 --> 03:59:51,820
Brrrrrr...

7460
03:59:54,220 --> 03:59:54,680
Um...

7461
03:59:57,060 --> 03:59:58,280
Mutsuki Aru...

7462
03:59:59,280 --> 04:00:00,920
Shiroko, Hoshino, Aru, Mutsuki.

7463
04:00:01,800 --> 04:00:02,640
Just those four?

7464
04:00:04,200 --> 04:00:05,320
I like Hoshino.

7465
04:00:05,340 --> 04:00:06,020
I like Shiroko.

7466
04:00:06,220 --> 04:00:06,420
I like Hoshino.

7467
04:00:06,420 --> 04:00:06,420
I like Shiroko.

7468
04:00:11,530 --> 04:00:13,390
Do they talk in the game?

7469
04:00:14,810 --> 04:00:15,670
Do they talk in the game?

7470
04:00:16,150 --> 04:00:18,430
Like... Do you hear their VAs?

7471
04:00:23,360 --> 04:00:23,880
Ugh...

7472
04:00:24,440 --> 04:00:29,060
The Doki Doki Literature Club streams are my favorite, second to the Yomawari streams.

7473
04:00:29,500 --> 04:00:30,000
are my favorite, second to the Yomawari streams.

7474
04:00:30,640 --> 04:00:34,420
The Yomawari streams where I literally lose my brain, my mind.

7475
04:00:35,940 --> 04:00:37,800
I wonder if I've gotten better.

7476
04:00:37,940 --> 04:00:38,020
I wonder if I've gotten better.

7477
04:00:39,260 --> 04:00:41,960
If I try and go back and play it now, if I...

7478
04:00:42,760 --> 04:00:43,160
Um...

7479
04:00:44,380 --> 04:00:45,360
If I'd be better.

7480
04:00:45,640 --> 04:00:47,020
I have Shiroko and Hoshino.

7481
04:00:47,460 --> 04:00:47,860
Nice!

7482
04:00:48,300 --> 04:00:48,820
My two!

7483
04:00:52,960 --> 04:00:56,060
I love the reaction when Hennia said she's serving her country.

7484
04:00:59,060 --> 04:01:01,980
You get more voice lines for them if you level up their bonding game.

7485
04:01:02,140 --> 04:01:02,900
You guys don't understand.

7486
04:01:03,520 --> 04:01:08,180
If Ogura Yui voices something, I either have to play it, I have to watch it, I have to do anything with it.

7487
04:01:08,640 --> 04:01:09,280
...

7488
04:01:11,200 --> 04:01:13,160
I'm always down for a redemption arc.

7489
04:01:15,240 --> 04:01:17,540
The Yomawari final boss fight.

7490
04:01:19,580 --> 04:01:21,840
It still haunts me to this day.

7491
04:01:22,140 --> 04:01:25,400
If you didn't know if a ghost could get haunted or not...

7492
04:01:26,380 --> 04:01:27,800
It haunts me to this day.

7493
04:01:33,560 --> 04:01:35,460
What's the first anime I watched?

7494
04:01:36,360 --> 04:01:38,180
It's hard to say because...

7495
04:01:39,440 --> 04:01:45,220
I watched anime before I knew of anime as a genre.

7496
04:01:45,440 --> 04:01:47,540
If you can call it that.

7497
04:01:47,680 --> 04:01:49,800
A medium, rather.

7498
04:01:50,120 --> 04:01:53,320
I watched Pokemon, Sailor Moon, and Dragon Ball.

7499
04:01:54,800 --> 04:01:56,100
A lot of those.

7500
04:01:56,960 --> 04:01:57,940
And then...

7501
04:01:58,500 --> 04:02:01,380
I think the first that I...

7502
04:02:01,380 --> 04:02:07,440
My sister's friend was like, Oh, do you watch anime?

7503
04:02:07,780 --> 04:02:08,880
And I was like, I don't know what that is.

7504
04:02:09,000 --> 04:02:12,000
And she showed me Inuyasha.

7505
04:02:14,460 --> 04:02:14,940
So...

7506
04:02:15,500 --> 04:02:19,420
And then from there I kind of watched Conan.

7507
04:02:19,660 --> 04:02:20,340
I got into Conan.

7508
04:02:20,780 --> 04:02:22,720
I got into Cowboy Bebop.

7509
04:02:22,960 --> 04:02:25,780
You know, I watched all those shows that were FLCL.

7510
04:02:25,980 --> 04:02:28,140
All the shows that were on Cartoon Network.

7511
04:02:31,080 --> 04:02:31,560
And...

7512
04:02:34,000 --> 04:02:36,280
My sister would show me shows too.

7513
04:02:36,420 --> 04:02:37,760
She showed me Elfen Lied.

7514
04:02:38,640 --> 04:02:39,900
I don't know why she showed that to me.

7515
04:02:40,000 --> 04:02:41,020
Why do I keep lagging?

7516
04:02:41,540 --> 04:02:43,280
I think the game is too beefy.

7517
04:02:47,060 --> 04:02:50,340
My Neuroquirk ReZero Season 3 airs in October.

7518
04:02:56,690 --> 04:02:57,390
Oh my gosh!

7519
04:02:57,510 --> 04:02:59,150
Yes, I also watched Cardcaptors!

7520
04:02:59,550 --> 04:03:03,610
I was cleaning... I moved some stuff around in my maid cafe recently.

7521
04:03:05,370 --> 04:03:06,170
And so...

7522
04:03:06,710 --> 04:03:09,010
When I was doing that, I was going through some old books.

7523
04:03:09,150 --> 04:03:12,390
And I found this old Cardcaptors book.

7524
04:03:12,670 --> 04:03:15,250
That I have had since I was a kid.

7525
04:03:15,390 --> 04:03:18,510
I even still have the Cloud Cards that I've had since I was a kid.

7526
04:03:18,970 --> 04:03:20,490
And like... it's just like...

7527
04:03:22,050 --> 04:03:24,110
Here's Sakura's friend, Madison!

7528
04:03:27,370 --> 04:03:28,870
So I watched that too.

7529
04:03:29,050 --> 04:03:31,450
I never... I don't think I ever watched Tokyo Mew Mew.

7530
04:03:31,550 --> 04:03:33,130
I watched a little bit of Sgt.

7531
04:03:33,190 --> 04:03:33,470
Frog.

7532
04:03:33,470 --> 04:03:33,470
Sgt.

7533
04:03:33,470 --> 04:03:33,850
Frog...

7534
04:03:36,030 --> 04:03:36,630
Sgt.

7535
04:03:36,630 --> 04:03:37,230
Frog...

7536
04:03:37,230 --> 04:03:38,150
Sgt.

7537
04:03:38,390 --> 04:03:38,990
Frog...

7538
04:03:40,690 --> 04:03:43,970
A mystic adventure, Cardcaptors!

7539
04:03:44,130 --> 04:03:44,190
A mystic adventure, Cardcaptors!

7540
04:03:45,950 --> 04:03:47,710
Do you know Sora no Aozora?

7541
04:03:47,750 --> 04:03:48,230
Do you know Sora no Aozora?

7542
04:03:48,350 --> 04:03:49,510
From Denpugumi Inc.

7543
04:03:52,490 --> 04:03:53,690
Oh Nan...

7544
04:03:53,690 --> 04:03:55,210
Oh Nan...

7545
04:03:55,210 --> 04:03:57,570
I absolutely know Sora no Aozora.

7546
04:03:57,810 --> 04:03:57,890
I absolutely know Sora no Aozora.

7547
04:03:58,330 --> 04:04:00,010
She retired... No!

7548
04:04:00,210 --> 04:04:01,530
Nan, she's in another group!

7549
04:04:01,630 --> 04:04:02,650
It's called Arcana Project.

7550
04:04:03,470 --> 04:04:04,310
She left...

7551
04:04:04,310 --> 04:04:06,610
She left Denpugumi.

7552
04:04:06,950 --> 04:04:09,130
But she is now in Arcana Project.

7553
04:04:10,750 --> 04:04:12,150
So you can still listen to her.

7554
04:04:14,910 --> 04:04:15,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7555
04:04:16,890 --> 04:04:18,690
Oh, I watched a little bit of Hamtaro.

7556
04:04:18,890 --> 04:04:21,910
I think I only remember watching so much of Hamtaro...

7557
04:04:21,910 --> 04:04:30,630
You know, Hamtaro because of the You know, they always say like When they run around and stuff.

7558
04:04:30,990 --> 04:04:32,790
That's my first impression of Hennya.

7559
04:04:33,470 --> 04:04:34,110
What do you mean?

7560
04:04:34,350 --> 04:04:35,530
She's absolutely perfect.

7561
04:04:35,790 --> 04:04:36,650
She's my Oshi.

7562
04:04:37,490 --> 04:04:39,810
There's nothing else that I can say about her.

7563
04:04:39,830 --> 04:04:40,270
She's perfect.

7564
04:04:40,730 --> 04:04:41,630
She's a genius.

7565
04:04:41,990 --> 04:04:45,270
Everything that comes out of her mouth is gold.

7566
04:04:45,470 --> 04:04:45,990
It's genius.

7567
04:04:49,970 --> 04:04:50,750
She's her.

7568
04:04:51,050 --> 04:04:51,590
Yeah!

7569
04:04:51,710 --> 04:04:52,570
She is...

7570
04:04:52,570 --> 04:04:53,570
She is her!

7571
04:04:58,300 --> 04:04:58,860
Yeah.

7572
04:04:59,220 --> 04:05:00,380
My Oshi.

7573
04:05:03,340 --> 04:05:05,660
I'm starting to get tired though.

7574
04:05:07,080 --> 04:05:08,480
I'm starting to get tired.

7575
04:05:08,700 --> 04:05:09,620
I had a...

7576
04:05:09,620 --> 04:05:13,900
I've been busy cleaning and doing some other stuff.

7577
04:05:15,380 --> 04:05:16,100
So...

7578
04:05:18,980 --> 04:05:21,800
I should probably go to sleep.

7579
04:05:27,630 --> 04:05:29,110
Oh god, no.

7580
04:05:29,190 --> 04:05:30,490
I actually...

7581
04:05:30,490 --> 04:05:32,450
I can't stop yawning.

7582
04:05:32,450 --> 04:05:35,150
Thank you guys for hanging out with us.

7583
04:05:35,990 --> 04:05:36,990
I hope you had fun.

7584
04:05:37,070 --> 04:05:38,670
Hopefully it wasn't so chaotic.

7585
04:05:38,950 --> 04:05:40,070
Chaos craziness.

7586
04:05:42,890 --> 04:05:43,490
That

7587
04:05:46,780 --> 04:05:48,120
was so fun.

7588
04:05:49,160 --> 04:05:50,220
Thank you guys.

7589
04:05:50,980 --> 04:05:52,600
My brain is mush.

7590
04:05:55,340 --> 04:05:57,020
My brain is mush.

7591
04:05:58,420 --> 04:05:59,020
My brain is mush.

7592
04:05:59,020 --> 04:05:59,140
My brain is mush.

7593
04:05:59,140 --> 04:05:59,800
Mush, mush, mush.

7594
04:06:05,400 --> 04:06:06,520
We love chaos.

7595
04:06:06,900 --> 04:06:08,400
Tomorrow will be a little less chaos.

7596
04:06:08,680 --> 04:06:09,040
Tomorrow will be a little less chaos.

7597
04:06:09,220 --> 04:06:10,040
Sexy chaos.

7598
04:06:10,560 --> 04:06:11,260
Sexy chaos!

7599
04:06:11,440 --> 04:06:12,620
Just came from Henya's stream.

7600
04:06:12,820 --> 04:06:14,000
More collabs!

7601
04:06:15,580 --> 04:06:16,780
Thanks for dropping by!

7602
04:06:17,080 --> 04:06:17,840
Thank you!

7603
04:06:20,260 --> 04:06:20,860
I see.

7604
04:06:20,940 --> 04:06:23,620
Also recommend look up this video if you want to see her play Ace Combat 7.

7605
04:06:23,740 --> 04:06:25,100
She did PvP with one of the devs.

7606
04:06:25,620 --> 04:06:26,420
Thank you!

7607
04:06:26,520 --> 04:06:27,500
I will watch it.

7608
04:06:28,000 --> 04:06:28,600
I will.

7609
04:06:28,640 --> 04:06:29,940
She also really loves Gundam.

7610
04:06:30,580 --> 04:06:31,020
So...

7611
04:06:32,000 --> 04:06:34,700
Actually, I forgot to tell her the last...

7612
04:06:34,700 --> 04:06:38,660
Because the last time I saw her, I wanted to tell her to play Metal Gear.

7613
04:06:38,840 --> 04:06:39,200
Because the last time I saw her, I wanted to tell her to play Metal Gear.

7614
04:06:40,480 --> 04:06:43,820
I think she would really like Metal Gear, so I want to tell her to play it.

7615
04:06:43,880 --> 04:06:44,540
If she hasn't already.

7616
04:06:45,480 --> 04:06:48,420
It's not Mecha, but it's kind of...

7617
04:06:48,420 --> 04:06:49,140
I mean...

7618
04:06:49,140 --> 04:06:51,000
I mean, Ace Combat is not Mecha either.

7619
04:06:51,180 --> 04:06:51,620
But you know.

7620
04:06:51,980 --> 04:06:54,160
She's also like a Gundam ambassador though.

7621
04:06:54,260 --> 04:06:55,200
So she's so awesome.

7622
04:06:55,540 --> 04:06:57,520
She's so perfect.

7623
04:06:57,760 --> 04:06:58,300
She's so cute.

7624
04:06:58,620 --> 04:07:00,360
I love my Oshis.

7625
04:07:03,960 --> 04:07:06,640
The gift subs sure do clog up the dono notice.

7626
04:07:06,720 --> 04:07:07,200
They do.

7627
04:07:08,120 --> 04:07:08,560
Hahaha.

7628
04:07:09,480 --> 04:07:11,040
I don't think I can turn them...

7629
04:07:11,040 --> 04:07:12,860
I don't know if I can turn them off, to be honest.

7630
04:07:16,750 --> 04:07:17,190
But...

7631
04:07:17,190 --> 04:07:17,590
You know.

7632
04:07:20,670 --> 04:07:21,110
Yup.

7633
04:07:21,510 --> 04:07:22,170
Okie dokie.

7634
04:07:22,270 --> 04:07:23,270
I'm going to bed now.

7635
04:07:23,950 --> 04:07:24,730
Thank you guys!

7636
04:07:24,990 --> 04:07:26,750
Oh, I see your streamlabs, Riko.

7637
04:07:28,390 --> 04:07:33,050
Consider investing in the Laser Guard, Dog Rover, and the Mortar Sentry.

7638
04:07:33,390 --> 04:07:36,350
They make everything much easier by clearing a lot of the trash for you.

7639
04:07:36,750 --> 04:07:37,910
We'll look into it.

7640
04:07:37,910 --> 04:07:38,450
Thank you!

7641
04:07:41,230 --> 04:07:42,470
Oh, my chat just disconnected.

7642
04:07:43,910 --> 04:07:45,970
I wonder if there's a way that I can turn off.

7643
04:07:46,130 --> 04:07:48,170
Because, you know, we don't need to see every...

7644
04:07:48,170 --> 04:07:48,330
Oh!

7645
04:07:49,450 --> 04:07:49,810
Huh?

7646
04:07:51,650 --> 04:07:52,150
Uh oh.

7647
04:07:54,270 --> 04:07:54,630
Uh...

7648
04:07:54,630 --> 04:07:55,310
Uh oh.

7649
04:07:55,750 --> 04:07:57,090
Wait, am I... I'm still stream...

7650
04:07:57,090 --> 04:07:57,410
Uh oh.

7651
04:08:01,380 --> 04:08:02,020
Uh oh.

7652
04:08:05,000 --> 04:08:05,540
Uh oh.

7653
04:08:14,060 --> 04:08:14,880
Thank you, Seymour!

7654
04:08:16,680 --> 04:08:17,040
Uh...

7655
04:08:17,900 --> 04:08:18,500
So...

7656
04:08:19,860 --> 04:08:22,320
I don't know if I can end the stream.

7657
04:08:22,640 --> 04:08:24,640
Because I don't remember my password.

7658
04:08:26,900 --> 04:08:27,500
Uh...

7659
04:08:27,500 --> 04:08:29,900
It's asking me to verify my account.

7660
04:08:29,980 --> 04:08:31,000
I don't remember my password.

7661
04:08:32,780 --> 04:08:33,080
Um...

7662
04:08:35,680 --> 04:08:36,280
Hmm...

7663
04:08:39,130 --> 04:08:39,730
Hmm...

7664
04:08:42,890 --> 04:08:44,090
Ah, hmm...

7665
04:08:44,090 --> 04:08:44,790
Hmm...

7666
04:08:44,790 --> 04:08:45,190
Hmm...

7667
04:08:51,890 --> 04:08:53,210
Hmm...

7668
04:08:53,210 --> 04:08:54,110
Hmm...

7669
04:08:56,440 --> 04:08:57,580
Wait...

7670
04:08:58,780 --> 04:09:00,180
Uh...

7671
04:09:05,500 --> 04:09:09,560
Their password was changed 21 days ago.

7672
04:09:14,720 --> 04:09:16,040
Uh...

7673
04:09:25,170 --> 04:09:27,070
Deleting system...

7674
04:09:27,070 --> 04:09:28,110
Deleting system...

7675
04:09:29,170 --> 04:09:29,970
Uh...

7676
04:09:36,830 --> 04:09:38,150
Um...

7677
04:09:38,150 --> 04:09:38,450
Um...

7678
04:09:39,990 --> 04:09:41,250
Forgot password.

7679
04:09:47,230 --> 04:09:49,690
Text means recovery number.

7680
04:09:55,360 --> 04:09:56,310
Oh, there it is.

7681
04:09:59,290 --> 04:10:01,210
Um, this is awkward, isn't it?

7682
04:10:02,930 --> 04:10:04,490
This sure is awkward.

7683
04:10:05,690 --> 04:10:06,510
Uh...

7684
04:10:07,990 --> 04:10:08,810
Uh...

7685
04:10:08,810 --> 04:10:11,210
Oh, yeah, I can get the code.

7686
04:10:11,930 --> 04:10:12,750
Um...

7687
04:10:12,750 --> 04:10:14,710
Anyway... Um...

7688
04:10:15,130 --> 04:10:17,010
Would you, uh...

7689
04:10:17,010 --> 04:10:17,810
Um...

7690
04:10:17,810 --> 04:10:19,890
Would you guys eat for dinner?
