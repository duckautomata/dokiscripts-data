1
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,240
Oh my

2
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:18,870
gosh.

3
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,170
Thank you for the welcome.

4
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,190
Super thank you!

5
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,450
Here is Day Old Red Envelope.

6
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,250
Happy Lunar New Year!

7
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,510
Thank you so much.

8
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,530
Thank you!

9
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,150
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

10
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,150
Welcome to Norowareta DigiCamp!

11
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,170
The Cursed DigiCamp.

12
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,910
Does anybody call it a DigiCamp?

13
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,130
They just call it a camera, right?

14
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,610
Why isn't it just called the Cursed Camera?

15
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,350
I don't know.

16
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,870
Lampy, thanks for the gift dude!

17
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,650
Your best side, you're my best view.

18
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,310
Bye Roblox!

19
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,630
Thank you for the welcome.

20
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,370
Happy Lunar New Year!

21
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,910
Happy Lunar New Year.

22
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,670
Oh my gosh.

23
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,890
My best side...

24
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,310
My best side I would say is this side.

25
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,770
Actually I don't know.

26
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,450
Maybe this side.

27
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,190
I don't know.

28
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,690
Which side?

29
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,230
I think you see more of my cheeks on this side.

30
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,590
You know what?

31
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,030
I like the view.

32
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,610
You're my best view.

33
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,530
I might be quoting that a lot tonight.

34
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,550
To keep myself sane.

35
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,470
I'm scared!

36
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,910
Notification didn't go off.

37
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,730
Now I'm late.

38
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,310
You're just in time.

39
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,210
We just started.

40
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,050
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

41
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,230
Andreyko, thanks for the 20!

42
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,630
DigiCamp makes me think of Marpat, Digital Camo.

43
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,410
Did you get tricked into playing Metal Gear?

44
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,570
I wish!

45
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,590
I wish this was Metal Gear.

46
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,870
My best friend thinks I'm addicted to you.

47
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,510
Yeah, he's not trying hard enough.

48
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,070
So true.

49
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,130
I don't know.

50
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,850
How do you convince someone to watch someone?

51
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:50,870
I don't know.

52
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,550
I'm not everybody's taste probably.

53
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,830
Probably like she's a little too freaky.

54
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,270
She's a little... She gets a little too wackadoodle out there I'd say.

55
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,450
It's my friend Mon's birthday!

56
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,490
They really love you.

57
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,210
I mean it a lot.

58
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,150
If you could sing them happy birthday.

59
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:08,950
Have fun, Minto!

60
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,390
Pure randomness, you're such a good friend!

61
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,890
I will sing happy birthday to Mon!

62
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,830
Happy birthday to you.

63
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,030
Happy birthday to you.

64
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,450
Happy birthday dear Mon!

65
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,470
Happy birthday to you!

66
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,450
Happy birthday!

67
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,230
So this is the new Chilla's Art Game, right?

68
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,230
I guess it's the newest.

69
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,150
It's been out for a little bit.

70
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:53,430
I watched some clips of Oli from Hello ID freaking out about some stuff.

71
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,710
About the game.

72
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,390
It seems kind of scary.

73
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:05,690
It seems so much more... It looks much better than usual Chilla's Art Game.

74
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,550
I don't know so much about it though.

75
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,890
Hello baby girl.

76
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,570
I hope you've been well and freaky.

77
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,550
I'm always freaky.

78
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,670
Saku!

79
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,190
Oh my gosh it's been a while.

80
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,250
Did you see they uploaded the Netflix DMC?

81
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,310
I did!

82
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,330
I did!

83
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,090
Did you guys see the new Devil May Cry opening?

84
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,510
Oh my gosh it's Limp Bizkit!

85
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,570
I can't believe it!

86
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,810
Oh my gosh.

87
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,290
I was like...

88
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,820
I was like no way.

89
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,300
I think this is made for me.

90
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
No way!

91
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:58,180
Yeah, you're going to have to watch the new... It's such a cool looking opening too.

92
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,340
It actually feels so Devil May Cry.

93
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,340
Best OP choice ever.

94
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,460
I did not expect it at all.

95
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,020
In fact I didn't really catch the song, what the song was until the chorus.

96
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,160
Then I was like, I haven't heard this song in so long!

97
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,540
I remember it so vividly to like Katamari.

98
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,720
Like seeing AMVs of that song to Katamari so long ago.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,040
I got my bachelors degree this week!

100
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,080
Nashi!

101
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,240
Congratulations!

102
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,240
I don't know...

103
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,420
Little Minky is up to give you lots of courage today.

104
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:46,880
Thank you!

105
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,540
I need it!

106
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,360
I need it!

107
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,960
You're pretty good.

108
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,260
Thanks Micmac.

109
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,860
Why isn't the emoji working?

110
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,880
Why didn't it work?

111
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,020
In the super chat.

112
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,740
YouTube, what the heck.

113
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,560
Lulugaming, thank you for 9 months!

114
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,300
Throwing out there that the new Netflix Devil May Cry anime OP release.

115
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,240
Yeah!

116
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,220
Oh my gosh.

117
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,080
I'm excited to watch it.

118
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,280
And I saw ladies in the opening too.

119
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,580
Ducky, thanks for the 5k!

120
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,600
Live streams look weird on YouTube now.

121
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,400
How do they look?

122
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,220
Do they?

123
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,520
Do they look weird?

124
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,520
Maybe you're being... Oh my gosh.

125
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,380
I thought my Twitter was broken.

126
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,160
And instead I got specially selected for one of the UI updates.

127
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,560
And so now everything looks terrible.

128
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,900
I don't want to be selected.

129
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,020
I want to be opted out please.

130
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
Albaro, welcome to membership!

131
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,080
Thank you!

132
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,520
So, yeah.

133
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,660
Opt out of Twitter.

134
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,660
I wish.

135
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,140
I wish I could.

136
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,640
I have too many idols.

137
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,040
Everything is there.

138
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,280
It's hard for me to just opt out.

139
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,080
Thank you for being a super wonderful freaky self.

140
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,600
Thank you!

141
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,060
Tiss himself, thanks for the 5 gifted.

142
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,960
Paperbacks, thanks for the 5 gifted.

143
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,020
I guess I should get it.

144
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,620
I guess I should just play this now.

145
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,040
It looks so scary.

146
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,220
It looks so scary.

147
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,660
Okay, I will be brave.

148
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,300
I will be brave.

149
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,740
I will be brave.

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,740
I will be brave.

151
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,980
I might be... I think there is like a bootleg Mickey Mouse in this.

152
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,980
I gotta make some jokes to get me through.

153
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,620
Hi, thanks for the 5 gifted.

154
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,300
I know I'm a ghost too, but like...

155
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,560
You see me in the maid cafe.

156
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,620
You don't see me haunting a little creepy playground.

157
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,200
That's weird.

158
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,920
I don't mess with those kinds of ghosts.

159
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,940
We don't mess with the Mickey Mouse ghost.

160
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,620
That's the legally distinct Mickey Mouse.

161
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,120
I'm in a maid cafe.

162
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,520
I'm that kind of freak.

163
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,300
I'm not a freak in the children's... the playground.

164
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,620
No, that's not my freak.

165
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,780
And I don't mess with the freak.

166
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,760
Steamboat willy.

167
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,700
That's just what it's called.

168
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,160
The Inky and the Minky Machine.

169
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,340
Wait, what was that game called?

170
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,930
Dottie Blot and the...

171
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
And the Inky World.

172
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,480
What was it called?

173
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,290
Bendy and the... No, it's not a Minky.

174
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,010
Bendy and the Inky Machine.

175
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,290
Yes, thank you.

176
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,970
Yeah, Bendy... Stop saying Minky.

177
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,670
Bendy and the Inky Machine.

178
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,710
That one.

179
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,230
That's the ghosty Steamboat Willy.

180
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,590
The OP borrowed things from DMC3 manga.

181
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,310
There's a manga even?

182
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,890
Why didn't Metal Gear get a manga?

183
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,750
When is Metal Gear getting an anime?

184
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,230
I know people will be upset about it though, because they're going to be like, it's going to suck.

185
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,750
People will be upset about everything.

186
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,490
Welcome to membership.

187
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,590
Thank you.

188
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,130
Metal Gear got novels, true.

189
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,890
They'd ruin it.

190
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,590
I don't know.

191
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,550
I don't know if they'd ruin it.

192
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,250
I feel though that maybe it wouldn't translate well.

193
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,210
Like in terms of art style.

194
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,670
MGS live action, which will never happen.

195
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,430
It will never happen.

196
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,850
OK, new game!

197
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,760
Can I move?

198
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,080
No.

199
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,540
How's the audio?

200
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,280
It's my right ear.

201
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,360
Start!

202
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,030
My daughter died in our local park.

203
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,920
I cannot sleep since then.

204
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,980
She torments me every day and night.

205
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,580
Wait, is she missing or did she die?

206
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,310
She is still bound to this world.

207
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,170
I must free her.

208
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,290
Oh my god, she's just like me for real for real.

209
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,570
Look at this picture on the left of her going down the slide.

210
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,390
Get her a bigger jacket she can't raise her arms up.

211
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,110
She's outgrown it.

212
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,610
It looks so forced.

213
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,490
She is no longer here with me.

214
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,010
Lost spirit liberation method.

215
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,590
Try not to get scared.

216
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,850
Scariest stories.

217
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,350
My daughter died in the local park.

218
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,170
It was the daughter killing park.

219
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,240
Lost spirit liberation method actually sounds like a Metal Gear mission though, I'm not gonna lie.

220
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,480
This is one of those games I've been avoiding on other Vtubers to watch you play specifically.

221
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,220
Do your worst.

222
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,240
Oh gosh, OK.

223
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,760
Is this actually fatal frame?

224
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,700
If it is, I will be scared.

225
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,480
After some searching, I found a website perfect for my needs.

226
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,320
Is this my house?

227
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,660
What is this?

228
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,940
A website that allows a lingering spirit to be liberated.

229
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,140
Me?

230
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,980
Actually me?

231
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:48,820
Maybe?

232
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,440
Sorry, should I put my arm down?

233
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:57,300
I wonder if it will get in the way of the subtitles.

234
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:07,940
The website states, take pictures of your deceased loved one with a camera made by a medium and upload 15 photos.

235
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,560
OK.

236
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,000
You guys don't try this though.

237
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,720
On me I mean.

238
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,680
It has to be of a loved one.

239
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,320
He will then receive a message from the spirit.

240
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,060
I don't know if I can really trust this, but it's the only way.

241
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,440
Oh.

242
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,420
I was one of the lucky few who got a hold of this special camera.

243
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,060
And I was relieved to know that my girl could finally rest in peace.

244
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,420
My girl.

245
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,800
OK.

246
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,680
We got the actual...what's the...camera obscura.

247
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,560
We got the camera obscura.

248
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,000
Why did we wake up face down in the toilet?

249
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,020
What?

250
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,560
I'm sure it will work if I try on you.

251
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,420
No, it won't.

252
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,880
Why did we wake up here?

253
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,220
Long night dad, huh?

254
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,280
I'm assuming we're dead.

255
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,360
I don't know.

256
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,040
Mom?

257
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,680
Dad?

258
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,800
Parent?

259
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,620
Parental figure?

260
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,560
OK.

261
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,580
I don't like the ship to run.

262
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,780
But it's fine.

263
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,080
Take a picture.

264
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,540
Check your photos.

265
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,120
Oh, nothing.

266
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,500
Oh, space party.

267
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,300
OK.

268
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,220
So we're like taking...

269
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,780
I found one.

270
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,340
Guardian, yeah.

271
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,660
MK, welcome to the membership.

272
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,420
Look right there.

273
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,980
Don't like that.

274
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,700
I found one already.

275
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,700
I'm a...wait, close.

276
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,360
Oh my gosh.

277
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,040
I'm a natural, honestly.

278
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,150
OK.

279
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,890
Anything else in here?

280
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,130
Oh, I don't like that you can like pull up the camera and not have the camera.

281
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,910
I just don't like it.

282
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,530
I'm also a vampire.

283
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,550
The paranormal runs in the family apparently.

284
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,250
Oh, it's a nice little park though.

285
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,670
3,

286
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,220
2, 1, 0.

287
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,700
Hello?

288
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Oh no!

289
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,920
Oh, there is a father!

290
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,320
Is this our dead daughter or is this another daughter?

291
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,400
I understand.

292
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,400
Wait, does that mean she's on the phone?

293
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,560
No.

294
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,040
Mickey Mouse!

295
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,220
Mickey Mouse!

296
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,580
Michael Moose?

297
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,160
Yeah, that's definitely Mickey Mouse there.

298
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,380
That doesn't even look like a mouse.

299
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,140
Wow,

300
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,800
we're in the game.

301
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,620
We're looking around.

302
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,480
We're looking for spirits of the park.

303
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,380
Couldn't we do this?

304
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,460
Oh, there's children over there.

305
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,300
Couldn't we do this on like a sunnier, nicer day?

306
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,380
Whose boots are these?

307
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,500
Your camera is blocking the subtitles.

308
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,060
I'll move my arm.

309
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:14,780
No worries.

310
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,900
No worries, no worries.

311
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,580
Oh, wait, hold on.

312
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,240
I'll be armless today.

313
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,170
There we go.

314
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,570
Camera on the head.

315
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,470
That's like my GoPro.

316
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,370
Hello, fellow kids.

317
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,930
I bet there's like a ghost anime in between you two.

318
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,370
Oh my god, there's a ghost!

319
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,750
Oh my god, he's...

320
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,030
Doesn't your back hurt?

321
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,470
He's literally performing...

322
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,710
He's like part of...

323
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,330
He's part of WWE.

324
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,430
He's gonna pull you down.

325
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,750
I don't know if I should be taking pictures of random children.

326
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,450
That's Chicky Chinchilla.

327
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,030
Oh, he's gone.

328
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,750
Is he gonna pop up when I...

329
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,470
Okay, alright.

330
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,710
That's two down.

331
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,310
Two out of fifteen.

332
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,490
Yeah, two out of fifteen.

333
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,890
Nice.

334
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,330
So I guess we should just be looking anywhere, right?

335
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,210
For any sort of paranormal activity.

336
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,290
In the puddle.

337
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,950
In the trees.

338
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,950
Ew, I don't like that place.

339
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,330
In the...

340
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,490
I feel safer without the camera.

341
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,290
I feel safer without it.

342
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,750
Okay, let's go look at those boots, because they were mighty suspicious.

343
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,010
Look!

344
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,950
Oh, it's running.

345
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,950
By itself.

346
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,250
That's suspicious.

347
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:09,730
Right?

348
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,450
Okay, nevermind.

349
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,030
It's just an artsy photo.

350
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,870
Wait, shouldn't it not be running by itself?

351
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,490
7022... What are the numbers?

352
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,210
The numbers, what do they mean?

353
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,250
Yeah, why is it black water?

354
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,970
It's disgusting.

355
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,150
Children are supposed to drink that.

356
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,030
Okay, let's check out these boots.

357
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,070
These boots are haunted for sure.

358
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:34,950
Okay.

359
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,990
There's numbers everywhere.

360
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,090
42?

361
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,310
53?

362
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,700
This swing's gotta be haunted.

363
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,300
Am I bad at this?

364
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,960
Why is there no ghosts?

365
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,980
Maybe I should be thankful?

366
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,440
We could just go home.

367
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,320
We could leave.

368
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,280
That would be a really great other...

369
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,120
Oh, Nico!

370
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,400
Thank you for the raid.

371
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,040
Hello, hello.

372
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,680
Chief.

373
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,740
What do we got here?

374
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,700
Mocari sweat.

375
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,000
Strawberry milk.

376
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,020
PPC.

377
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,640
Wow, you can actually read these so clearly.

378
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,140
Never been done before.

379
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,220
Wow, invisible boost!

380
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,000
Thank you so much for the 50.

381
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,040
Give the thank you!

382
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,000
Suspicious bag.

383
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,810
Guys, I think I'm bad at this game.

384
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:43,950
Tires.

385
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,530
Can you crouch or anything?

386
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,410
No.

387
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:51,990
Do you guys see anything?

388
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,090
There's numbers everywhere.

389
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,990
Trees.

390
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,810
You also walk so slowly when the camera is up.

391
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,380
Oh my god.

392
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,920
Where did that come from?

393
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,680
A literal tree hugger.

394
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,480
God.

395
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,940
Am I lagging sometimes?

396
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,680
I think the game is a little...

397
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,830
Oh, my daughter.

398
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,410
Okay, 6pm.

399
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,350
Bing bong, bing bong.

400
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,010
That kid has been at it for a while.

401
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,110
Really been scratching...

402
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,350
How do we know the ghost we are taking is of my kid?

403
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,810
I guess we are just assuming that.

404
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,110
This is still going.

405
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,470
I feel it must be haunted.

406
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,270
Oh my god!

407
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,590
Are you my...

408
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,550
Are you my daughter?

409
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,730
It was haunted after all.

410
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,870
How did I miss that?

411
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,990
Okay, cool.

412
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,270
How many have we got now?

413
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,990
We can get rid of this one.

414
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,290
1, 2, 3, 4.

415
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,810
4 out of 15.

416
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,230
Good job, team.

417
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,570
Haunted bench.

418
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,520
Sorry, I thought I heard like a crying or something.

419
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,720
As long as those kids are there, I feel safer.

420
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,140
I'm not gonna lie.

421
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,500
I'm like, yeah.

422
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,600
Oh, cute!

423
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,660
Not cute.

424
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,560
Hello, daughter.

425
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,020
Oh god, that looks so haunted in there.

426
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,640
This could have been an email.

427
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,260
Kind of announcement.

428
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,020
Sorry, I've been very busy.

429
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,000
You think her face would appear?

430
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,320
Wait, why are there rocks surrounding it?

431
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,650
Atmosphere is getting to me a little bit.

432
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,410
It's pretty spooky, you guys.

433
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,490
There's numbers everywhere!

434
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,470
Wait, that was last year.

435
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,650
Is this every...

436
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,410
Every year a child is taken?

437
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,510
Is the numbers...

438
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,970
Wait, what was another number?

439
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,270
There was one out here.

440
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:22,890
Wait, it's...

441
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:28,570
Gosh.

442
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,190
They will be important.

443
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,830
Oh no, this is another bathroom.

444
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,270
I can't go in here though.

445
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,630
This is that boy's bathroom.

446
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,270
That's gross.

447
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,650
There was number...

448
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,270
Is the smiley still there?

449
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:47,830
It is.

450
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,870
This is the thumbnail.

451
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,090
Oh, CC.

452
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,570
Oh wait, 4000...

453
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,170
Okay, never mind.

454
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,930
Never mind.

455
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,770
Is this supposed to be a panda or...

456
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,130
This one looks like a koala.

457
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,810
This one looks like a dog.

458
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,770
Maybe a...

459
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,070
A tanuki?

460
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,370
RIP future child.

461
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,630
It's like a... What was that movie?

462
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,710
Where he goes, let me in now.

463
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,150
And it will be nice.

464
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,650
I come back every...

465
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,050
Couple hundred years...

466
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,610
Not one...

467
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,410
Long legs.

468
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,290
See?

469
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,670
24, 26.

470
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,850
Someone... Oh, maybe there's like someone...

471
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:43,930
Someone will be taken.

472
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,910
I don't see any...

473
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,650
Okay, never mind.

474
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,070
Okay, what about in here?

475
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,270
I see a soccer ball.

476
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:55,890
No.

477
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,210
Oh, no, no.

478
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,250
It looked like it had a face on it for a second.

479
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,890
I'm too afraid to take out the camera, you guys.

480
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,430
In the tree.

481
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,770
The ghost of a monkey?

482
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,030
Just got off my first day on my new part-time job.

483
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,630
Alright, let's go into the boys' bathroom.

484
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,490
I'm scared.

485
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,350
Oh wait, there's a light on up there.

486
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,910
Can I zoom?

487
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,010
Sorry, I didn't mean to take a picture of your house.

488
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,480
It would have really sucked if there was a lady changing in the window, huh?

489
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,720
Bugred?

490
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,260
Barry!

491
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
What the...

492
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,140
Oh, is that me?

493
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,120
Oh, that's my floating camera.

494
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,160
My floating ghost camera.

495
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,820
Look at it.

496
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:56,920
Spooky!

497
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,680
Take off!

498
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,640
Thanks for the gifted, Andrew!

499
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Thanks for the five gifted!

500
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,040
Thank you, guys.

501
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,380
I do enjoy this ghost.

502
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,760
Have you played this game before?

503
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,480
Oh, we can go up the slide.

504
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,010
Wait, this is a perfect vantage point.

505
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,950
Where we can see all ghosts.

506
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,510
Have you played this game before?

507
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,510
It's kind of scary.

508
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,950
I mean, nothing has happened, but...

509
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,890
Oh my god!

510
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,430
Why did I close my eyes to go down the slide?

511
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,950
Are you a baby?

512
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,370
Just himself.

513
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,910
Thanks for the gifted!

514
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,250
Alright, let's go into the boys' bathroom.

515
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,130
Barry, if I call you...

516
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,270
Do you want to be on call with me?

517
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,130
I'm scared.

518
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,810
I don't mind, really!

519
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:06,470
Would you?

520
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:08,370
Is it okay?

521
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,570
Is it okay, you guys?

522
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,300
Barry messaged me.

523
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,790
I'm scared, you guys!

524
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,990
Are we calling Barry Bug?

525
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,810
Barry Bug, help me!

526
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,210
Are you sure?

527
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,890
I'm telling her no pressure.

528
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,390
She doesn't want to join.

529
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,350
I'm scared!

530
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,010
Ravenel, happy birthday!

531
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,690
Happy birthday to you!

532
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,330
Happy birthday to you!

533
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,550
Happy birthday, Ravenel!

534
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,170
Happy birthday to you!

535
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,910
Happy birthday!

536
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,270
Okay, I'm gonna call Barry now.

537
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,770
I have to set it up real quick.

538
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,990
Okay, I'll call.

539
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,550
Hello?

540
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,330
Hello?

541
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,190
Hello?

542
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,190
Hello?

543
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,030
Is my thing broken?

544
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,290
Hold on, let me check my...

545
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,690
Oh wait.

546
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,530
Hold on!

547
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,810
I hear you!

548
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,870
Sorry, my mic was...

549
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,990
My mic is destroying itself.

550
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,550
Oh no, I think it was me.

551
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,570
No, it was on me.

552
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,710
I fixed something.

553
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,170
Okay, let me put your foogie.

554
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,890
Oh no, I have to log in the Discord.

555
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:09,530
Hold on.

556
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,790
Let's not do that.

557
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,950
I'll just do this instead.

558
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,870
Hold on, let me make sure my foogie isn't something weird either.

559
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,370
No, I'm not gonna do the foogie.

560
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,650
Oh wait, I can't do this.

561
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,450
It's only servers.

562
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,350
Oh, this sucks.

563
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,550
Oh, it's over.

564
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,770
It's so over.

565
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,770
Wait, okay, I'm gonna log in the foogie.

566
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,150
Dang it, I have to... What's my email password?

567
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:30,810
I don't know.

568
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,250
Oh, I got it!

569
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,450
Yay!

570
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,650
Everybody say hi to Berry!

571
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,370
Oh no.

572
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:47,750
Hello.

573
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,210
Why are you dying?

574
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,750
Sorry to crash your stream.

575
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:58,190
No!

576
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,490
I'm sorry to ask you to come on because I'm too baby to play this game.

577
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,350
No, I totally understand.

578
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,050
How is Berry's audio, everybody?

579
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,480
Oh.

580
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,880
It's good?

581
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,280
Okay.

582
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,600
Do you want me to stream the game to you?

583
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,420
Yeah.

584
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,940
Wait, I mean, how scary is... Wait, you only started like 30 minutes ago.

585
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,300
Is it like super scary?

586
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,260
It's... Nothing's happened.

587
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,740
No, I totally get it though.

588
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,020
I totally get it though.

589
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,600
Do you?

590
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,720
Do you?

591
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,420
Okay, I'm streaming the game to you.

592
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,340
The biggest thing about horror games is just like you psych yourself out, man.

593
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,620
The atmosphere is killing me.

594
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,760
Oh man.

595
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,980
Okay, are you ready?

596
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,000
Alright, let's play.

597
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,020
Are we going into the boys bathroom first?

598
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,700
Wait, sorry.

599
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,080
We're in the boys... Okay, so basically we have... Look at Mickey Mouse.

600
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,740
No, what do we call him?

601
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,820
Chunky Chinchilla?

602
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,820
Chunky Chinchilla?

603
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,420
Yeah.

604
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,640
Pickle Mouse?

605
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,120
Pickle Mouse?

606
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,940
Michael Mouse?

607
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,500
Oh, Michael?

608
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,160
And so we have our camera and we're trying to take pictures of our dead daughter.

609
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,680
She could be anywhere.

610
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,880
Oh, see!

611
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,720
She's up there!

612
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,640
She's chilling!

613
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,740
Is she moving?

614
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,320
Wait, this game is fucked up.

615
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:28,800
What the hell?

616
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,300
I know.

617
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,320
It's kind of messed up.

618
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,280
What just happened?

619
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,600
Get out.

620
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,060
Get out.

621
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:35,540
Get out.

622
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
What happened?

623
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,340
What happened?

624
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,380
Why is the music so scary?

625
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,400
What's happening?

626
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Barry, what did you do?

627
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,960
She's coming.

628
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,640
Don't say that!

629
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,460
Barry, you cursed the stream!

630
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,580
It's over.

631
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,040
I gotta head out you guys.

632
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Please don't leave me.

633
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,760
I don't think we can crouch in this game so I guess we just gotta crawl in here with our whole ass body.

634
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,120
Oh look, there's a heart!

635
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,540
I hate like semi-realistic games like this too.

636
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,040
Oh wait, there's kids nearby.

637
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,880
I know, I took a picture of them.

638
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,580
Is that allowed?

639
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,500
I don't know.

640
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,720
Apparently.

641
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,300
Okay, let's see what's this.

642
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,220
Oh, this is a backpack.

643
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,420
Oh, that's kind of messed up.

644
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,140
No, she's just hanging out.

645
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,880
Why is her head in the bag?

646
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,500
She's just hanging out everybody.

647
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,540
Wouldn't it be so fucked up if like...

648
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,380
Sorry.

649
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,740
What were you gonna...

650
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,320
You did this!

651
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,940
No, I didn't do anything!

652
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,780
I'm just here as your emotional support.

653
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,640
Chinchilla!

654
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,440
Oh no, I hate this!

655
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,900
Wait, this is terrible.

656
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,140
Wait, was I supposed to take a picture of them?

657
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,640
I can return home.

658
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,320
I could.

659
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,320
It keeps giving me the option and it's really tempting every time.

660
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,120
Wow, you're so brave.

661
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,940
Wait, but you're a ghost so shouldn't you be like...

662
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,800
This is your alley.

663
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,540
This is your home ground.

664
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,720
You would think...

665
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,460
I just don't deal with these kinds of ghosts, you know?

666
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,500
I deal with...

667
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,020
I hear something.

668
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,300
I'm imagining it in my...

669
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,600
I'm lagging so bad.

670
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,840
Maybe you should stop streaming to me.

671
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,980
It's ok.

672
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,000
I'll watch the stream.

673
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,620
Are you sure?

674
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

675
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,100
I'm hearing lots of noises.

676
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,860
There's a lot going on here.

677
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,400
Ok, I'm gonna stop streaming to you.

678
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,720
Sorry.

679
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,240
No, it's ok.

680
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,520
You're like...

681
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:03,880
Dude, I started playing... I tried playing Cabin Factory because you were playing it and I was like...

682
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,080
If Mint played it, maybe I can play it.

683
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,580
No, I couldn't play that game.

684
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,560
I seriously couldn't.

685
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:09,940
Why?

686
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:10,980
Where's the ghost?

687
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,120
Hello?

688
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,720
Oh god, why is it so loud?

689
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,240
Ok, I just... I have to imagine it in my mind's eye where...

690
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,820
Where you have very messy hair, you have mascara running down your face and that's like spooky.

691
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,140
And then once you have that outfit...

692
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,420
You'll be so brave.

693
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,880
What are you rambling about?

694
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,940
Sorry, I got caught up in my own fantasy, I think.

695
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,600
There's gotta be something haunted in this house.

696
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,800
I was so right.

697
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,560
How many more do I need?

698
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,120
You have that sense.

699
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,340
I do.

700
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,520
Well, it was red.

701
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,240
It just seemed like, you know...

702
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,400
Wait, how did your kid die?

703
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,320
He didn't say!

704
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,260
Why'd the ambiance stop?

705
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,960
Oh, ok, nevermind, it started again.

706
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,400
Oh, this is a chill as art game?

707
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,280
It looks so different, right?

708
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,940
Yeah, what the heck?

709
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,560
So we need 15 photos.

710
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

711
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,220
Find my pages.

712
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,100
I have to be strong.

713
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,600
If I'm more scared, then Mint will hug you for comfort.

714
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

715
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,800
Hold on a minute.

716
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:02,740
Are you the type of person that if someone's more scared, you will level up and be awesome?

717
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,800
I'm like...

718
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,100
Are you?

719
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,960
I don't know.

720
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,100
I feel...

721
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,200
I feel...

722
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,080
Already safer that you're here.

723
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,960
Wow, what the...

724
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,060
She doesn't know that I'm hacking her game so it's more scary.

725
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,240
Don't say that.

726
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,900
Ever since you've gotten here, it's become scarier and scarier.

727
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,540
There's gotta be a ghost here.

728
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,100
What the heck?

729
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,680
This is us using the slide.

730
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,640
Why is it raining in the slide?

731
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,200
Oh my god, I think our daughter drowned.

732
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,560
Because there's been a lot of stuff of her in the water.

733
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,380
Wow, this is just a sequel to Heavy Rain and we just didn't know.

734
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,220
What was your daughter's name?

735
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,180
What was her... It started with an M.

736
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,240
I'm not sure.

737
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,640
Jason.

738
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,280
Wait, is Jason or Sean Heavy Rain?

739
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,020
It's both.

740
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,740
Do you think there's something in here now?

741
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,200
I'm too scared.

742
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,560
I believe in you.

743
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,340
It's just a hole.

744
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,220
That hole was made for you.

745
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,360
It was definitely not.

746
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,720
Let's see.

747
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,860
I haven't really been over here.

748
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,160
There's a bunch of papers over there.

749
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,820
I'm too afraid to explore.

750
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,700
Oh, this is now stinky.

751
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,560
I like your delayed reaction.

752
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:02,920
I don't like the chunky chinchilla guy that's around.

753
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,400
That's actually scary.

754
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,340
I don't like him either.

755
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,420
Oh, I'm lagging again.

756
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,020
Sorry, everybody.

757
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,420
The game's not lagging.

758
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:10,880
Just me.

759
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,460
Okay, guys.

760
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,540
Optimization is a lost art.

761
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,600
Oh, we have another... I know, right?

762
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:24,740
I only feel safe now playing games that are on consoles.

763
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,000
Because I know that they won't lag.

764
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,300
Have you been playing Indiana Jones on consoles?

765
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,900
Yeah.

766
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,360
I started it on my computer and it was so bad that I had to switch to my Xbox.

767
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,370
I'm an everybody gamer.

768
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,970
I think I start lagging every time I'm near a ghost.

769
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,010
It's like an interference, you know?

770
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,290
See, I get better once the ghost is gone.

771
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,430
Damn, the ghost is like a bazillion polygons.

772
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,410
Oh, sweet.

773
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,550
The ghost just hacked the vending machine and gave us a bunch of free drinks.

774
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,710
Oh!

775
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,330
Okay, let's go.

776
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,410
What did we get?

777
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:18,990
We got all these golden ones.

778
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,570
Oh no, my daughter, she was a caffeine addict.

779
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,850
All she drank was coffee.

780
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:32,410
I'm afraid we're about to get jumped by this mouse.

781
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,210
No, not for real.

782
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,450
I don't like it.

783
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,100
How many more do we need, Barry?

784
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,040
Aren't you at the beginning of the game?

785
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,240
We only need 15.

786
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:54,520
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12!

787
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,840
Oh my god, that's... how many more is that?

788
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:01,840
Twelve.

789
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:03,800
Three more.

790
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,280
Okay, everybody start telling me when I'm lagging and then we'll know that we're by a ghost.

791
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,020
I'm hacking.

792
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,080
I feel it.

793
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,900
Where did the ambiance go?

794
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,160
Okay, it's back.

795
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,340
There hasn't been anything with these guys.

796
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,170
Wait a second.

797
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,110
He has a shadow and then he doesn't have a shadow!

798
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:36,810
Look at that!

799
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,470
Oh my god, the game is haunted!

800
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,790
I can't tell if that's a glitch or not.

801
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,650
I think it is a glitch.

802
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:48,870
Wait.

803
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,030
Oh no.

804
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,650
Barry, Barry, Barry...

805
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,370
It wasn't a glitch?

806
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:52,910
It wasn't a glitch?

807
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,390
Barry, Barry, Barry...

808
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,410
No, no, no.

809
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:58,830
Calm down.

810
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,690
Red is the color of love.

811
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:04,830
I'm glitching.

812
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:05,490
I'm glitching.

813
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,100
But I don't want to see Chunky Chinchilla.

814
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,420
I don't want to see him.

815
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,720
Look at him in the eye.

816
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,820
He's more scared of you than you are of him.

817
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,920
I don't think that's true.

818
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,100
I think there's something in here but I don't want to see it.

819
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,000
What are they?

820
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,060
Oh my gosh, it's a bunch of drawings of the Chinchilla.

821
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,440
I think... What if he murdered my daughter?

822
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,020
Oh,

823
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,040
I'm glitching again.

824
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,820
There must be something.

825
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,480
I'm checking.

826
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,620
In the trees.

827
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,260
Oh my gosh, I'm too scared to look around.

828
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,460
Okay, anybody tell me if you see something.

829
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,360
It could be a ground ghost.

830
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,160
I don't know.

831
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,540
That's true.

832
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,320
That's true.

833
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,560
Worms could have ghosts.

834
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,940
The origami killer.

835
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,320
The origami killer.

836
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,980
These games are so fun.

837
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,240
When is that guy going to make a new game?

838
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,620
Wait, that's not the same guy that made Detroit become human, right?

839
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:37,800
It is.

840
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,240
It is.

841
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,200
Okay, when is he going to make another one?

842
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,040
You gotta go... Have you ever played Fahrenheit?

843
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,500
Indigo Prophecy.

844
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,020
That one's actually so funny.

845
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,480
You have to play that one.

846
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,480
Fahrenheit.

847
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,420
What's that one about?

848
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,240
It's about a guy who gets possessed.

849
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,600
Sorry.

850
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,700
What happened?

851
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,720
Oh, I see him.

852
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,260
I see him.

853
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,720
Oh, come on.

854
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,620
I got a better picture than that.

855
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,260
He's kind of cute.

856
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,480
Like, in a fucked up way.

857
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,100
This is actual cursed photography.

858
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,120
I don't want that anymore.

859
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,520
I don't even remember what it had.

860
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,920
I just remember laughing so hard.

861
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:30,760
You need to play it.

862
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,360
Okay.

863
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,700
I believe you.

864
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,700
There's gotta be something with these boots.

865
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,060
Maybe you have to look above?

866
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,320
So, maybe they're like...

867
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,920
Oh, you're so big-brained.

868
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,900
And you were wrong.

869
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,780
Your brain means nothing.

870
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,700
Well, I'm trying, okay?

871
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:53,880
I'm trying.

872
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,260
I am too.

873
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,720
I'm trying and I'm crying.

874
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,540
I wanna return home.

875
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,300
It's so tempting.

876
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,640
You get the bad ending then?

877
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,880
If you return home?

878
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,120
I have no idea.

879
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,080
I feel like it's a waste if you go home now.

880
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,080
True.

881
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,310
You're so close.

882
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,220
I know.

883
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,380
We only have two left.

884
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:17,860
Anything here?

885
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,700
Am I lagging?

886
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:20,760
No?

887
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,400
Full proof Vtuber plan.

888
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,100
If you lag, then there's a ghost around.

889
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,080
If you were a chinchilla, where would you be hiding?

890
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:34,880
A chinchilla?

891
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,880
Yeah, like the chinchilla guy?

892
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,900
Don't the chinchillas stay in the trees?

893
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,800
I don't actually know.

894
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,380
Where do chinchillas...

895
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,980
Where do they live?

896
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,800
Like they are... I know they have to be in dust.

897
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,880
But other than that...

898
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,680
Okay, we got that area.

899
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,560
I don't know.

900
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,280
Maybe something with the tires.

901
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,640
Oh wait!

902
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,580
Is that a body part?

903
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,720
What's that sound?

904
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,260
I hear something.

905
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,900
Barry, I'm too afraid to turn around.

906
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,060
He's right behind me.

907
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,060
Don't say that!

908
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,400
Oh, Ashton!

909
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,400
Hi, Ashton.

910
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,380
I'm sorry, we don't know anything about chinchillas.

911
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,580
Yeah, sorry, Ashton.

912
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,060
Maybe you could educate us...

913
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,840
on your cleaning habits.

914
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,540
Maybe this bench or...

915
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,160
You're not supposed to go to the red area.

916
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,280
I went to the red area, right?

917
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,280
Oh, I thought it got more concentrated.

918
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,120
I don't think so.

919
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,420
Oh god, my eyes.

920
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,460
I think it's because we stand here, our eyes get adjusted to it.

921
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:06,920
Maybe?

922
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,060
I don't know.

923
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,720
I think we just get our... How many photos is that now, guys?

924
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:17,560
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14!

925
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,080
Just one more!

926
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,760
Okay, okay, okay, lock in, lock in!

927
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,680
Lock in!

928
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:27,960
Uh...

929
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,300
If I were a ghost, I would be in a tunnel.

930
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,840
But I got a picture of the tunnel earlier.

931
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,360
Okay!

932
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,080
Boogers, I'm a ghost in the tunnel!

933
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,700
It's just a ball?

934
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,620
Tell me it's just a ball!

935
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,540
Tell me it's just a ball!

936
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,060
The delay is...

937
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:06,280
Sorry everybody, I can't cast to bury because...

938
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,360
It makes me lag even more.

939
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,760
Unoptimized game, please understand.

940
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,680
It's a delayed punch, man.

941
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,360
I know.

942
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,860
But you'll know that something's coming.

943
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,000
Thank you for being my shield.

944
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:23,900
Yeah, you're welcome.

945
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,440
Maybe the bench?

946
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,020
Any chinchillas here?

947
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,180
I can't tell if I'm supposed to be taking pictures of him or not.

948
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,980
I don't think it counts.

949
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,320
I think he's just there to mess you up.

950
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,100
I think so too.

951
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,460
They're here to throw off my groove.

952
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:39,660
Yeah.

953
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,440
He's about to cease and desist you.

954
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,020
Actual Disney.

955
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,320
He's coming!

956
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,040
I don't know where...

957
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,240
I think I'm just in mud.

958
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,320
More numbers!

959
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,220
5, 9, 6, 4...

960
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,160
I'm in a soup.

961
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,380
5, 9, 6, 4...

962
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,300
What could it mean?

963
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,960
That was such a bore.

964
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,560
I saw...

965
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,760
I saw earlier that someone was...

966
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,700
It was like a clip that was like, Barry gets tricked into playing P.T.

967
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:23,940
No!

968
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,400
Oh my god, I don't want to ever play P.T.

969
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,380
But the amount of times that people just reference it in other games is insane.

970
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,000
Have you played P.T.?

971
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,520
No!

972
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,060
Play it!

973
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,020
I saw you and Matara were playing it.

974
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,400
I was like, oh my god.

975
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,540
You're like forcing Matara like Clockwork Orange style to play it.

976
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,020
Yeah!

977
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,060
Clockwork Orange style.

978
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,300
Yeah, come over, you can play it.

979
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,080
No!

980
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,080
I can come over for other reasons too, right?

981
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:58,900
No.

982
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,600
Do you think I can call the number at the...

983
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,760
5, 9, 6, 4...

984
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,720
Okay, she's kind of smart with it.

985
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,400
Because this doesn't...

986
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,700
Oh, you can!

987
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,320
This little bitch.

988
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,860
That was the last one!

989
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,560
I'm gonna drown.

990
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,200
Game over.

991
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,420
No, no, no, Harry Houdini can get out.

992
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,240
You can get out too.

993
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,860
Harry Houdini is dead!

994
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,320
No, but he died for other reasons.

995
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,540
Oh, it's raining!

996
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,940
Oh gosh, it's really hard to see.

997
00:53:54,260 --> 00:54:03,880
Okay, the darkness is taking over the playground, so I think I'm gonna leave.

998
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:05,720
Bye!

999
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:05,860
Bye!

1000
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,280
You will not be able to return...

1001
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,660
Oh, thank God, we will not...

1002
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,540
Oh my God, game over!

1003
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,920
I think we did it.

1004
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,680
You got a game over?

1005
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,480
We go back home, that's a game over, right?

1006
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,520
But, did you do it?

1007
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,460
Did you solve the mystery?

1008
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,060
So now we have to take our photos and we have to upload them to the dark web.

1009
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,260
Yeah.

1010
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,740
So we auto-select all of them.

1011
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,540
This warning feels kind of ominous.

1012
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,840
The photos must be taken within 13 days after the death.

1013
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,180
What if she died before?

1014
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,780
Well, I guess it's over then, huh?

1015
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,620
Maybe.

1016
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,680
Hold on, I'm gonna get rid of this spammer.

1017
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,320
Go away!

1018
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,860
How long ago did she die?

1019
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,980
I don't...

1020
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,500
They said she went missing.

1021
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,340
It's over.

1022
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,380
I don't remember.

1023
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,840
It was like yesterday.

1024
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:30,700
Larry?

1025
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,560
Oh my gosh, do you know Offline?

1026
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:35,640
No?

1027
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,740
Okay, you don't know Larry.

1028
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,660
I don't know Larry, I'm sorry.

1029
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,840
You don't know scariest stories, try not to be scared.

1030
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
No, I don't know anything, man.

1031
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,840
Okay, I'm gonna send you all the videos after this.

1032
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,720
Okay, thank you.

1033
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:57,820
You don't know the meat worm, you don't know Larry, you don't know...

1034
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,460
I know the creatures, wait, like the YouTube group?

1035
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:02,780
No, who?

1036
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,640
Oh, wait, shit, nevermind.

1037
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,620
Who's the YouTube group?

1038
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,820
There's a YouTube group called the Creatures, but I don't know if we're on the same...

1039
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,240
Ashton just fucking sent me a crotch... a pants grab, what the hell?

1040
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,280
Ashton, I hate you.

1041
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,760
Like, vulgin?

1042
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,520
Vulgin?

1043
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she just vulgined me.

1044
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,160
Okay, I upload these pictures now.

1045
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,740
You upload, you upload.

1046
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,380
I'm uploading?

1047
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,840
Woah, we're on old-school internet.

1048
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,000
Holy...

1049
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,360
It's gonna take one minute, 40, 30, 20 seconds, 21... fastest internet ever.

1050
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,880
Ew, why do I have a foot... what is this?

1051
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,820
Oh, this is like the Slenderman...

1052
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,740
Wait, I didn't know you were taking video.

1053
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,040
We didn't take video.

1054
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,840
Why is this Jaws music?

1055
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,640
Oh, it's before.

1056
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,320
You were having so much fun...

1057
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,680
Why would you take a video of your kid going to the bathroom?

1058
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,500
What is wrong with my game?

1059
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,220
I think it's glitched.

1060
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,880
Oh, there's a person in my apartment.

1061
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,540
Yeah, you, right?

1062
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,540
Guys, this doesn't seem normal.

1063
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,000
This doesn't seem like it should be happening.

1064
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:36,540
What do you mean?

1065
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,360
The iconic black goop.

1066
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,740
Wait, yeah, I think your game is kind of...

1067
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,540
I think my game is broken.

1068
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,560
Sorry for bugging out, you guys.

1069
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,500
Ew, look, there's literally bugs in my apartment.

1070
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,340
Get out of it, Taricon.

1071
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,320
What are you talking about?

1072
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,860
That bug is climbing up the air.

1073
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,380
Okay, I...

1074
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,640
This is sick and twisted.

1075
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,140
I see, I see...

1076
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,220
Oh my god, he's coming towards us.

1077
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,640
I see how you feel now.

1078
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:11,600
It's okay.

1079
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,280
Squash.

1080
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,380
Squish-squash.

1081
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,900
Okay, well, I'm just gonna try and get through the darkness, everybody.

1082
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,860
What am I supposed to do here?

1083
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,460
Oh my god.

1084
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,900
Okay, this black goo is kind of intense.

1085
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,420
I know, it's hard.

1086
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,560
It says she's still here.

1087
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:33,420
Do I go through here?

1088
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,960
Okay, it doesn't open.

1089
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,620
Do I go through this?

1090
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:45,440
Look on OBS preview.

1091
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,300
Don't look at your game.

1092
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,740
Yeah, true, true, true.

1093
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,640
Should I reload?

1094
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,080
If I quit though, will I have to start the game over?

1095
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,100
I don't... Yeah, I don't know.

1096
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,620
I don't know if it's saved.

1097
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,440
I don't know either.

1098
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:00,860
Try the camera.

1099
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,020
Well, thank you, Mint, for playing this game and letting me join it.

1100
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,920
Now I don't have to play this game myself.

1101
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:10,360
Yippee!

1102
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,520
Yeah, you're welcome!

1103
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,160
Is there a ghost in there?

1104
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,000
Oh, that's my daughter!

1105
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:21,360
What's going on?

1106
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,240
I don't like this.

1107
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,040
I don't like this.

1108
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,140
I don't like it.

1109
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,020
I don't like it.

1110
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,540
I don't like it.

1111
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,820
They're telling you to turn off your graphics AI settings.

1112
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,160
But I don't know what the...

1113
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,400
Graphics AI settings.

1114
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,360
Where do I find that?

1115
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,900
I had to put everything on high.

1116
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,600
Because I was like... Oh, maybe the shadow maps.

1117
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,000
Disable black fog.

1118
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,140
That's not even an option.

1119
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,500
I don't know what to put it on.

1120
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,500
Well, obviously the guy...

1121
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,680
You guys are liars!

1122
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,840
The Wisps are liars!

1123
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:02,540
They're liars!

1124
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,640
What else is new?

1125
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,660
I don't know.

1126
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,080
I'm gonna turn off the shadow maps.

1127
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,600
See if that helps.

1128
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:18,740
Maybe?

1129
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,300
No.

1130
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,660
It's still pretty intense.

1131
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,520
That's just your roommate.

1132
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,480
He has like a lot of aura.

1133
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,420
Yeah, we got that.

1134
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,600
Yeah, he's got that real energy.

1135
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,300
You can feel it.

1136
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:41,720
Yeah.

1137
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,120
Upscaling?

1138
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,000
Oh, turn off upscaling?

1139
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,740
Oh, like this.

1140
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,080
Let's try.

1141
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:52,860
Did it work?

1142
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,000
No.

1143
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:01,100
Well, we gave it a chance.

1144
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,560
I can go inside now.

1145
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,960
Damn, did you live like this?

1146
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,320
Welcome to my house.

1147
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,960
You can stay anywhere.

1148
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,960
Oh, I thought that was a stain, but thank...

1149
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,680
I hear a sound.

1150
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,960
Get out of the air!

1151
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,820
No wonder it's stinky in here.

1152
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,420
Hiding bodies in the air.

1153
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,960
What am I supposed to do with...

1154
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,360
Oh, there's numbers here too!

1155
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,780
Okay, so I'm having to take 15 more photos?

1156
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:47,860
4209.

1157
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,940
I just heard someone flush the toilet.

1158
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:55,220
Maybe this is your job, you just go to these places and take photos and then go home and then...

1159
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:55,860
I don't know.

1160
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:56,980
I don't know.

1161
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,840
I thought it was about your daughter dying.

1162
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,820
He's got some long, long arms.

1163
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,180
Some teeny tiny hands.

1164
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,200
Little T-Rex over here.

1165
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,020
Don't make fun of his hands.

1166
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,160
Sorry, it was kind of...

1167
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,620
Was that there before?

1168
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,700
Oh, it wasn't.

1169
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,580
Did you ever do that?

1170
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,300
Hell yeah!

1171
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,980
See, this game isn't scary.

1172
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:44,160
There's a fan, there's a...

1173
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,040
Use your Wii points!

1174
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:46,760
Use your Wii points!

1175
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,300
Oh wait, there's another number.

1176
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,560
Yeah, there's this number and this number.

1177
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,340
I hear something.

1178
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,380
Like crackling.

1179
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,360
Maybe here?

1180
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,180
Oh, it's just this bug.

1181
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:03,860
Why'd you say it like that?

1182
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,360
I don't know.

1183
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,840
Oh, the stream is like stuttering a little bit.

1184
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,280
No way!

1185
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,940
This game is so cursed in more ways than one!

1186
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,700
I swear, this is my last ever Chilla's Art game.

1187
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,820
I can't do this anymore.

1188
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,320
You're just exposing your potato PC.

1189
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,400
What?

1190
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,800
I just got this PC!

1191
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,260
I literally just bought every new part.

1192
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,560
It's completely new.

1193
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,180
It's not good enough for Chilla's Art!

1194
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,140
Trill.

1195
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,660
Triple A Gaming over here.

1196
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:39,440
Oh god.

1197
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,260
I'm hearing bugs everywhere.

1198
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,360
What the hell?

1199
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,180
Can you stop saying that?

1200
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,440
That's hurting my feelings.

1201
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,000
Sorry.

1202
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,660
I'm hearing someone flush the toilet!

1203
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,740
Sorry, that was me.

1204
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,860
Then don't flush it, Batuu!

1205
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,440
Oh.

1206
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,160
Oh.

1207
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,320
I just...

1208
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,720
I just leave it?

1209
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:08,850
At least they're clean.

1210
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:12,170
Is there someone in here?

1211
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:13,050
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

1212
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,750
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1213
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,610
But someone's flushing the toilet!

1214
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,090
You're so brave!

1215
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:20,370
You're so brave and awesome!

1216
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,990
You're so beautiful and brave and awesome!

1217
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:25,130
And your brain is so green and so wrinkly!

1218
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:25,790
Okay, no one's in there.

1219
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,530
Someone in the mirror?

1220
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:30,090
No one.

1221
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,280
Oh, it's my daughter's room.

1222
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:36,920
Mitsuka.

1223
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,360
I'm hearing...

1224
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,940
I'm hearing flies.

1225
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,860
Is the body still in there?

1226
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,360
There's bodies everywhere.

1227
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,000
Oh my gosh, those shadows are scaring the heck out of me.

1228
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,480
Someone said keep looking at the toilet.

1229
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,320
What?

1230
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,520
Oh, see?

1231
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,080
It flushed, it flushed, it flushed!

1232
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,140
Oh, it flushed?

1233
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,920
Did you know...

1234
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,900
Did you know all mammals take around 21 seconds to pee?

1235
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:17,660
Really?

1236
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,080
Yeah, so next time you go to the bathroom, you should time it.

1237
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,340
And send it to me.

1238
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:24,220
Okay.

1239
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,860
Yeah, I'll do that.

1240
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,120
I'll get the stopwatch out even.

1241
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,260
I'll give you the most accurate numbers.

1242
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,820
Down to the millisecond.

1243
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,520
Yeah, yeah.

1244
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,240
You should keep a log.

1245
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,360
The toilet is supposed to be a safe...

1246
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,580
Oh, I see a ghost up there.

1247
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,180
Did you see her?

1248
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,040
Oh shit, I did, I did, I am, I am right now.

1249
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,400
Oh, she's just chilling.

1250
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:58,880
Did you guys see it?

1251
01:05:58,920 --> 01:05:59,620
She was up in the corridor.

1252
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,740
I'm gonna take a picture of her and I'm gonna close my eyes.

1253
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,440
Stay strong, stay strong.

1254
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,080
She looks real freaky.

1255
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:08,720
Why?

1256
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,620
That's not my dot.

1257
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,880
Oh, what happened to her?

1258
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,800
Oh, maybe she's camera shy.

1259
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:14,640
Oh god.

1260
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:16,280
Maybe.

1261
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:18,340
What?

1262
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,640
The toilet's still going.

1263
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:21,600
Ghost?

1264
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:22,900
You look like ghosts to you?

1265
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:29,770
The toilet ghost.

1266
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,690
Actually, there's a song about that.

1267
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:32,690
Oh yeah?

1268
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:35,910
It's about a toilet kamisama.

1269
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,310
And it's about... check the door.

1270
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:40,070
That's the ghost I just...

1271
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:46,050
She's literally opening it up and flushing the toilet.

1272
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:47,130
Holy shit.

1273
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:53,750
Wait, isn't that just like the really technologically advanced automatic toilets?

1274
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,310
Yeah.

1275
01:06:54,450 --> 01:06:55,470
I think that's just how they work.

1276
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,730
Actually, I think that's literally just how they work.

1277
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:00,170
It's not automatic at all.

1278
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:03,390
It's just someone living inside the toilet that reaches out.

1279
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:08,910
Don't look behind the curtain, everybody.

1280
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:11,630
There's always a man behind the magic.

1281
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,390
How many photos do I need?

1282
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:18,650
1, 2, 3, 4... I have 6.

1283
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:21,490
Do I need 15 again?

1284
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,690
It looks like maybe?

1285
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:28,370
Oh, what's in here?

1286
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,790
Okay, we can't go in there.

1287
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:34,690
Oh my gosh, I just hear creepy crawlies everywhere.

1288
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,230
Can I leave?

1289
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,950
Let's go into my daughter's room.

1290
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:46,130
Okay, I can't.

1291
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,260
Into the kitchen?

1292
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,620
This is actually such a nice place.

1293
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,440
Uh, there?

1294
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:09,580
Oh, little toes.

1295
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:14,200
She thinks we can't see her.

1296
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,080
What a dumbass.

1297
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:15,760
I know.

1298
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,880
World's worst hide-and-seek champion right there.

1299
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,440
I'm scared to look around.

1300
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,060
Okay, it's okay.

1301
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,080
I don't think there's any jumpscares here.

1302
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,960
So I don't think this is a jumpscare game.

1303
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,020
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1304
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,500
I feel like it should be though.

1305
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,440
I feel like it's luring us into a false sense of...

1306
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:41,940
security.

1307
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,960
No, no, no, you just gotta believe.

1308
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,080
Also, that's a lot of beer.

1309
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,060
Oh, this is beer.

1310
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,180
I thought it was the coffee.

1311
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,600
From the vending machine.

1312
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,720
I think it's beer, isn't it?

1313
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:55,940
Asahi Super.

1314
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,380
Yeah, we get that Asahi Dry.

1315
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:03,380
What else?

1316
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,140
In the fridge?

1317
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,940
Why can't I see anything?

1318
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,620
Dude, that's my gripe with a lot of these games.

1319
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:14,240
I don't have a good dark vision, so I'm just legitimately blind.

1320
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:16,160
For so much of it.

1321
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:16,720
Yeah.

1322
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,500
I even turned up the brightness.

1323
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:19,680
Oh, goodness.

1324
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:25,280
Turn the brightness up.

1325
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:28,740
Maybe we do a little bit more because we have the...

1326
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,280
The... what's it called?

1327
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,900
Let's try 3.1.

1328
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,000
That didn't do much, I think.

1329
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,120
Who's the fredman?

1330
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,960
My name is Matara Khan.

1331
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,200
Yeah, I'm a bug.

1332
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:48,980
Yeah.

1333
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,860
Thanks, Matara, for being here.

1334
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,480
You're the much more tolerable...

1335
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,740
Tolerable Matara Khan.

1336
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,780
Wait, don't say that.

1337
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,020
She's actually gonna kill me.

1338
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,720
Oh, you think maybe the TV.

1339
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,520
That would be kind of spooky.

1340
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:05,580
Anything?

1341
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:06,540
No?

1342
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:07,040
Okay.

1343
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,320
Nothing outside, really?

1344
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,560
I knew it.

1345
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,660
Yeah, I guess you just have to think about like...

1346
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,480
Stereotypical places, maybe?

1347
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,140
Stereotypical what?

1348
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,740
Ghost places?

1349
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,460
Like where they would usually be, maybe?

1350
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:31,860
Yeah.

1351
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,520
Oh, let's try...

1352
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,220
I didn't... Oh, gosh.

1353
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:36,740
There's a lady!

1354
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,480
There's just a regular lady!

1355
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,360
That's just a regular lady!

1356
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,620
That's just a regular lady!

1357
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:43,880
I don't have the camera!

1358
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:46,780
Pina?

1359
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,000
Pina.

1360
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,480
Should I take a picture of her?

1361
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,480
I knew I thought you said your camera was...

1362
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,260
Oh my god.

1363
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:19,700
Why is she...

1364
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,680
Ma'am, I think you're too old for that uniform.

1365
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,980
She says you're never too old to cosplay.

1366
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,460
Yep, eternally 18.

1367
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,480
She's actually such an iconic queen.

1368
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,140
She's just a normal person.

1369
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,380
I think she's maybe...

1370
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:46,260
I think that's even worse that there's just a normal person in my house.

1371
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,740
Maybe you left the door open.

1372
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,680
Oh god, I'm so embarrassed.

1373
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,180
It's so smelly in here.

1374
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,900
And we have like a massive shadow problem.

1375
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:58,780
This is so...

1376
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,780
Wait, that's true.

1377
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,720
Oh my gosh, she's gonna see how shadowy and terrible my house is.

1378
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,200
It's not normally like this.

1379
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,420
Oh god.

1380
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,680
Yeah, I just let myself go this weekend.

1381
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,260
It's just, you know, I played a lot of Kingdom Hearts.

1382
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,820
The darkness is coming in.

1383
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,780
Okay, should I walk to her?

1384
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:20,080
I think you have to, right?

1385
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,300
Okay, I'm gonna close my eyes and I'm gonna run.

1386
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,000
What's happening?

1387
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:33,840
I don't know.

1388
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,940
That scared me.

1389
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,900
Oh, she came at me really slowly.

1390
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,240
It's like she was approaching a small animal.

1391
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:46,080
Don't worry.

1392
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,440
It was really like that.

1393
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,960
Maybe they really are more afraid of us than I am of them.

1394
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:51,960
Yeah.

1395
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,980
You're the real ghost here.

1396
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:55,760
True.

1397
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,340
Why is the music getting weird all of a sudden?

1398
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,560
I wanna try and put in one of these numbers.

1399
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,160
We have 4209 everybody.

1400
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,180
But I'm scared what if that lady comes back?

1401
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,520
It'll be okay.

1402
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,420
Who is she?

1403
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,200
Oh, yeah.

1404
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,720
Oh, the phone was there.

1405
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,760
Make sure you close the door from the kitchen to the hallway.

1406
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,560
Kitchen to the hallway.

1407
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:37,660
Oh my god.

1408
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,500
The door just shut by itself.

1409
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:40,780
Why?

1410
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,800
No, it's okay.

1411
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:48,380
That was just me.

1412
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:48,800
That was me.

1413
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,560
I'm your roommate.

1414
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,040
That was me.

1415
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:50,820
Sorry.

1416
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,180
Okay.

1417
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,320
The kitchen to the hallway.

1418
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:54,820
This one?

1419
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,000
It's like little hints.

1420
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,460
There it is.

1421
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,100
Neat.

1422
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,740
Wait, so then, does that number then go away?

1423
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:15,860
It's gone.

1424
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:17,680
Oh my god.

1425
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:18,700
Okay, okay.

1426
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,400
So the numbers that are left are just...

1427
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,200
Okay, okay.

1428
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:23,980
The numbers that are left are pictures I haven't taken of yet.

1429
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,740
Was the one on the picture frame still there?

1430
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,040
Picture frame?

1431
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,000
This one?

1432
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:31,300
Oh, yeah.

1433
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:32,240
3617.

1434
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:33,940
Okay.

1435
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:35,720
We're gonna do it.

1436
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,200
Wow, the ghosts are so helpful.

1437
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,000
I know, right?

1438
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:39,500
3...

1439
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:40,800
6...

1440
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,440
1...

1441
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:42,540
1...

1442
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:42,980
7.

1443
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,880
The bugs behind the fridge are disgusting.

1444
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,020
Where did they even come from?

1445
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,680
I noticed there was more bugs than normal there.

1446
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,840
You're cheating on me.

1447
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,080
Look at all these bugs.

1448
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,740
They're all inhabiting my home.

1449
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:00,720
Like here?

1450
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,540
You're a bug magnet.

1451
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,080
Oh my god.

1452
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,080
Her texture is a little broken, but that's okay.

1453
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,520
She's still spooky.

1454
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,360
Oh, I see.

1455
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,260
Yeah, it was broken.

1456
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:16,420
Yeah.

1457
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,820
How many more?

1458
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:21,980
9...

1459
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,580
10...

1460
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:22,900
11.

1461
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:23,760
Oh, we're close!

1462
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,540
I don't remember seeing any other numbers, you guys.

1463
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,240
Uh...

1464
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:35,540
I think someone said to check the closet before, but I don't know if that's still like...

1465
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:36,660
The closet.

1466
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:37,480
This one?

1467
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:38,400
Closet.

1468
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:39,540
It's kind of...

1469
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,160
I don't know.

1470
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,700
Maybe the one that's like the doorway?

1471
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,080
Like the walk-in one?

1472
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,140
This one over here?

1473
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,300
Hold on, I'm loading.

1474
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:54,140
Someone said there's one on the couch.

1475
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,020
Couch.

1476
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:00,280
Couch.

1477
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:06,060
Okay, next person to lie in chat will get their hair...

1478
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:07,100
Bad luck for 7 years.

1479
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,420
Yeah, yeah.

1480
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,760
I was gonna say I'm gonna rip their hair off, but yeah.

1481
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,920
You can choose your preference.

1482
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:17,380
Oh,

1483
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,360
on the wall?

1484
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,160
Where on the wall?

1485
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:24,980
There's like...

1486
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,720
We're in a house, there's walls everywhere.

1487
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:27,860
Here?

1488
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:28,920
That's true.

1489
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:30,780
There's no ghost.

1490
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,620
I can't tell what's a ghost and what's a shadow.

1491
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,520
I know, everything is a shadow.

1492
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:39,960
Oh, this closet.

1493
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,640
Oh, it's kind of cracked open, right?

1494
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,440
Oh gosh, I'm scared of this.

1495
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,660
Oh, there's a number.

1496
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:52,960
Oh, 6834.

1497
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,560
Wait, is there anything in this corner?

1498
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,720
Is that a ghost or...

1499
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,420
Oh, what is that?

1500
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,780
Something shiny in there.

1501
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,400
I'll take a picture.

1502
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,000
Wait, once it shows...

1503
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,300
No, I think it's just a texture thing.

1504
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,660
What was the number?

1505
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:14,640
Six...

1506
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,080
Sorry.

1507
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,520
Oh, 6834.

1508
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,440
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1509
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,400
Did you get that from chat or did you...

1510
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:24,900
No.

1511
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,740
Why do they keep shutting the door?

1512
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:28,820
Stop it.

1513
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,240
I am very helpful, guys.

1514
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:33,880
Six...

1515
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,080
Eight...

1516
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:35,800
Three...

1517
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,780
Four...

1518
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:38,640
The inside of the table is warm.

1519
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:41,300
Okay, the kotatsu.

1520
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,160
Yeah.

1521
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,420
Or this table.

1522
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:45,680
I don't know.

1523
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,300
I don't think it's that one.

1524
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:50,640
Oh, maybe here.

1525
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,080
Oh god.

1526
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:58,120
I don't know.

1527
01:17:59,240 --> 01:17:59,860
Where?

1528
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:03,500
Kotatsu?

1529
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,420
I can't crouch or anything, so...

1530
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:06,900
Oh.

1531
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,400
What was that?

1532
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,700
Just my kid being a freaking weirdo.

1533
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,160
What was that?

1534
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:29,880
What's that sound?

1535
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:35,270
What's that sound?

1536
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:40,270
It's me.

1537
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:46,450
What is that sound?

1538
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:48,090
I don't know.

1539
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:51,530
I've been stream muted, sorry.

1540
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:52,230
What?

1541
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,650
I don't wanna hear it.

1542
01:18:56,670 --> 01:18:58,050
I think someone's doing my dishes.

1543
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,650
Oh, I can't get my camera out anymore.

1544
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:03,590
Wait, why not?

1545
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:06,850
Is the lady at the front door again?

1546
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:07,690
Oh no, no.

1547
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:08,610
I can't get the camera.

1548
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:09,430
I don't know.

1549
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:13,410
Maybe it's in my daughter's room.

1550
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:21,790
It's like a...

1551
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:23,650
Here, just listen.

1552
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,120
Oh, I do hear it.

1553
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,420
It's like an earthquake type.

1554
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,720
Everything is going crazy.

1555
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,700
Everything is going crazy in this.

1556
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,560
My whole house is haunted.

1557
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,740
Yeah, you're in it.

1558
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,180
Ehhh!

1559
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:43,440
Cutscene!

1560
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,860
Oh my god!

1561
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,160
Chunky Chinchillas in my house!

1562
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:48,700
Sorry.

1563
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:53,640
I don't like mascot stuff like that.

1564
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:54,780
What happened?

1565
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:05,640
You're so brave.

1566
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:06,800
You're so brave, Mint.

1567
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,520
You're so brave.

1568
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,300
You're so brave and awesome.

1569
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,160
You can do this.

1570
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:12,900
You can do this.

1571
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,160
One foot.

1572
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:15,680
One foot.

1573
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:20,540
Oh,

1574
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:30,830
is it like Fatal Frame?

1575
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:33,850
Are you like pushing him back with the camera?

1576
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:35,070
I think so.

1577
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:36,590
Oh no!

1578
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:37,590
Come on!

1579
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:38,590
I'm stuck in a corner.

1580
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:39,290
This is perfect.

1581
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:40,310
Come at me!

1582
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,030
Come at me, Chunky!

1583
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:44,310
Chungus!

1584
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:45,090
Chinchilla!

1585
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:46,650
Chungus!

1586
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:47,470
Ashton!

1587
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,890
Don't call Ashton that.

1588
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:53,870
Ashton Martin!

1589
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:59,530
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

1590
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:01,230
I don't know...

1591
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,110
Maybe you're supposed to like walk around.

1592
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:07,450
How am I supposed to walk around with this freakazoid coming at me?

1593
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,190
I wonder what happens if he touches me.

1594
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,970
Is the game over?

1595
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:11,390
Maybe.

1596
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:15,730
Uncanny.

1597
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:17,910
Chingu!

1598
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:18,710
Chingu!

1599
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:26,550
I hear...

1600
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:29,530
He was running!

1601
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:30,770
I heard him go...

1602
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:32,090
I heard his little feet!

1603
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:33,330
I heard his little feet!

1604
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,510
He's running at me again.

1605
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:37,930
I hear him.

1606
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:38,830
I hear him.

1607
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:39,410
Come on.

1608
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,110
It's like thunder and lightning.

1609
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:41,530
Come here!

1610
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:42,370
Come here!

1611
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:47,950
I'm not moving from this corner.

1612
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:49,310
You can't make me!

1613
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:52,490
I can't tell if I'm doing this right.

1614
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:54,710
Wait, should I look up a guide?

1615
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:55,310
I don't know.

1616
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:55,970
I don't know.

1617
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:57,530
Wait, hold on.

1618
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:58,950
I hear him.

1619
01:21:59,010 --> 01:21:59,810
He's running again.

1620
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,810
I can't...I can't do this.

1621
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:12,530
He's got a chainsaw!

1622
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:14,490
Hold on.

1623
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:14,810
Hold on.

1624
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:15,130
Hold on.

1625
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,690
He's got a chainsaw!

1626
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:20,950
Just get in your ass and run!

1627
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,990
I don't know if I can keep going this way.

1628
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:25,830
I just might.

1629
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:26,950
Where is he?

1630
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:32,380
Oh my god.

1631
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,340
He's not wearing pants, Barry!

1632
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,200
He's not wearing pants!

1633
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:41,880
I hear him.

1634
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,800
This is the boss fight, I think.

1635
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,280
It is?

1636
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,280
With his...

1637
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,200
Oh my god, I think he's running at me again.

1638
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,320
I don't know.

1639
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:51,960
Maybe it is the boss fight.

1640
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,460
I got an achievement!

1641
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,280
Finish the boss fight without dying!

1642
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:56,640
Oh, you did it!

1643
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,480
Wait, so you were...

1644
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,840
I didn't know you were a gamer like that.

1645
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,620
I gamed.

1646
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:03,860
I gamed.

1647
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:04,480
I gamed.

1648
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,320
You're a gamer.

1649
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:07,240
Oh my god.

1650
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,820
Wait, he's doing my strat.

1651
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:09,740
He's sitting in the corner.

1652
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,080
The AI learns from you.

1653
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,040
No, no.

1654
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:21,900
I can't move.

1655
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,060
I can't move even.

1656
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:34,330
Oh, hello.

1657
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,930
What's happening?

1658
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,210
What's happened?

1659
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:41,350
Why is there blood all in my room?

1660
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,230
I mean my daughter's room.

1661
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:44,830
She's a weirdo.

1662
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:46,990
She's got anime girls all over her wall.

1663
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:48,670
She's just like me.

1664
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:50,330
I know.

1665
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,110
We beheaded him.

1666
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:56,790
We beheaded the Chungus.

1667
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:59,550
Take that Chungus chinchilla.

1668
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:00,930
That was scripted though, right?

1669
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:01,590
I think so.

1670
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:02,130
I think so.

1671
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:02,650
I think so.

1672
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:07,270
Oh, I don't have my camera anymore.

1673
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:09,630
Oh, it's Henya.

1674
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:12,850
Oh, it's the supporters, right?

1675
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:13,290
Yeah.

1676
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:20,290
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1677
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:23,290
I remember seeing people saying there's Doki.

1678
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:26,290
Oh, there she is.

1679
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:26,710
Yeah.

1680
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:31,650
Oh, I do like... Oh, that's why it was like crayon.

1681
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:31,950
What?

1682
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:33,070
Because it's your daughter's room.

1683
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,050
Perry, you didn't tell me you were in the game.

1684
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:40,630
Dog, I've never... Don't ever call me for help again.

1685
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,030
I can't believe this.

1686
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,850
Wait, what is this then?

1687
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:54,370
Damn, sexy lady.

1688
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:58,010
Is that my daughter?

1689
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,370
Oh, she really liked the Chungus man.

1690
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:08,470
And then she hated him.

1691
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,230
Yeah, we killed him.

1692
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:13,990
Yeah, we killed him with the power of...

1693
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:16,870
Friendship.

1694
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:19,670
Friendship?

1695
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:20,950
I don't know about that.

1696
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:22,990
Do I leave or...

1697
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:25,250
Oh, yeah, I guess this is the end.

1698
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,870
I said final boss.

1699
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:29,150
Yeah.

1700
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:32,270
And I don't have a camera anymore.

1701
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,450
I don't have my camera, you guys.

1702
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:41,270
Where's the...

1703
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:48,340
But...

1704
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:53,060
I don't have my camera and also I said I beat the final boss, so where's the ending of the game?

1705
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,000
No, no, no.

1706
01:25:54,400 --> 01:26:00,160
You're playing as your daughter and you probably woke up in the middle of the night and now it's time to watch Inuyasha on Adult Swim.

1707
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,780
You're so right.

1708
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:15,960
Here we go.

1709
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,140
We're playing on the computer in the darkness.

1710
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,680
We're full gamer mode.

1711
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,200
Upload a ghost photo.

1712
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:37,600
What?

1713
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,120
There's more?

1714
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,720
No, no, no.

1715
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,840
These are not the photos I took.

1716
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:53,690
Oh, you gotta help your daughter find her way back to the spirit world.

1717
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,740
If they made that into a plushie, would you get it?

1718
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:05,620
Oh, no.

1719
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,320
You're crazy.

1720
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,020
You sure?

1721
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,680
You said you kind of liked him.

1722
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,700
No, I never said that.

1723
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,800
What are you talking about?

1724
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,980
You're putting words in my mouth.

1725
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:26,320
You want me to blatantly lie on the internet?

1726
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:27,960
What the heck?

1727
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,040
I thought the photos looked different.

1728
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:32,480
Yeah, these are not the photos we took.

1729
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,080
We must really like this one photo of our daughter.

1730
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:37,300
Yeah.

1731
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,820
It's divisible by 5.

1732
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,660
I like 15 as a number, you know?

1733
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,020
Press the camera icon.

1734
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:00,780
You can't.

1735
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,880
You like 15 as a number?

1736
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:06,400
Yeah, 15 is a pretty good number, right?

1737
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,660
Do you just say anything?

1738
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:11,540
Who says that?

1739
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:14,600
That's a good number.

1740
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:16,840
What the heck?

1741
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,380
You're so judgmental.

1742
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:21,520
What the heck?

1743
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,180
Nah, I like 14.

1744
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:24,780
Okay.

1745
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,940
Okay, I'm uploading this to the internet.

1746
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:34,740
2015 is when Metal Gear Solid 5 came out, so what if I like it because of that, huh?

1747
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:38,220
Valid.

1748
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:41,120
Valid.

1749
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,520
So, actually, so real.

1750
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:43,880
I'm a believer now.

1751
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:44,940
You convinced me.

1752
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,160
Yeah, 15 is a good number.

1753
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,320
Violation.

1754
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:54,860
Damn,

1755
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,320
we procrastinated too much.

1756
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,560
I hate these damn... You can't go on any site anymore.

1757
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:11,720
If you have an adblocker, the internet... If you don't have an adblocker, the internet is literally impossible.

1758
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:13,020
Yeah.

1759
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,900
This is like you go to any news website.

1760
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,360
It's just like boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1761
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,380
Man.

1762
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,000
Man.

1763
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:26,460
That's why we're sponsored by Minto Explorer.

1764
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,900
There's an adblocker.

1765
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:32,100
Oh, another video.

1766
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:37,820
Someone's walking from the bedroom.

1767
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,080
Hello, daughter.

1768
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,360
She's really slow.

1769
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:48,820
Also, where is dad's room?

1770
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:49,900
Where do we sleep?

1771
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,420
Can I move?

1772
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,240
No, I can't move around.

1773
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,780
On the couch, yeah, I guess so.

1774
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:03,360
Oh my god, she's like sliding backwards a little bit.

1775
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,100
She was moonwalking to the...

1776
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:07,800
She's a big fan of Michael Jackson.

1777
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:09,960
Wait, what?

1778
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,960
Oh my god, she accidentally touched the phone of death.

1779
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,840
It's the phone that kills you.

1780
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:17,920
Don't do it, Mitsuka.

1781
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,360
What?

1782
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:24,940
She took the phone and played the brown note immediately.

1783
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:26,300
Oh no.

1784
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,800
Oh, that's...

1785
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,080
What happened?

1786
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,560
She just died?

1787
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:33,960
Wait, what just happened actually?

1788
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,800
Yeah, we never should have installed the phone that kills you.

1789
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:37,580
I know.

1790
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:41,980
What?

1791
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:44,280
What?

1792
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,940
Why is there more?

1793
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,400
Why is there more?

1794
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,320
No!

1795
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,120
I don't have my camera.

1796
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:56,380
Are you sure it said final boss on the achievement?

1797
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:56,980
It did!

1798
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,240
It said final... Oh, our fan is gone.

1799
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,700
Why is that the part that we clean up?

1800
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,500
I'm so confused.

1801
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:08,880
Wait, all the... Oh no, I was gonna say all the trash is gone.

1802
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:10,780
No...

1803
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:11,400
Hello?

1804
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:14,040
Hello?

1805
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:25,180
Who do you think it is?

1806
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:30,600
Yeah, it's... Pizza?

1807
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:31,600
Pizza?

1808
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:39,000
Oh my gosh, that's like the other... There's another Chilla's art game where you play as a pizza person.

1809
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,220
Oh, right.

1810
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:41,860
Imagine if they were connected.

1811
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,740
That'd be insane.

1812
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,600
Yeah, it might be.

1813
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,300
The Chilla's art extended universe.

1814
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,840
Oh god, I'm scared.

1815
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:56,100
No, it's just a book.

1816
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,520
No, it's a missing poster.

1817
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,200
Oh no, it's just a book.

1818
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:02,680
It's not a book.

1819
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:03,900
Oh god.

1820
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,980
Manami Kodan?

1821
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:08,420
What?

1822
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,600
That's not our daughter.

1823
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,000
That's not our daughter?

1824
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,240
What the...

1825
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,500
They really want to hammer it home that that's not your daughter's name.

1826
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,360
What's going on?

1827
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:29,820
Oh god.

1828
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,840
Can I leave?

1829
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,140
What's going on?

1830
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,260
I don't have my camera.

1831
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,160
Where do I go?

1832
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:53,600
Go to the door.

1833
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:54,880
This one?

1834
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,140
The supporters.

1835
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,060
The supporters will help me.

1836
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:04,160
Keep looking at Henya.

1837
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,780
Oh, the phone's ringing.

1838
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,320
Yeah, keep looking at Henya.

1839
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:14,070
Hello?

1840
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:17,830
Hello?

1841
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:20,950
Wait, it's the phone that kills you.

1842
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:21,670
Don't do it dad!

1843
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:29,230
You were

1844
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:38,890
watching when she said this earlier, right?

1845
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:41,370
Oh no.

1846
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:44,410
She said that there was a phone call in the park earlier.

1847
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:46,290
It was the same conversation.

1848
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:48,370
I see.

1849
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,450
Bloody bathroom.

1850
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,330
You know what I will say?

1851
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,430
I feel like Japan has such nice...

1852
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:04,050
Or like most places...

1853
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:05,970
Because Japan likes the really big tubs.

1854
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,110
I love that.

1855
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:09,470
Oh yeah, the camera now.

1856
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:12,950
I don't think I want the camera.

1857
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:17,490
So that's the missing girl that's not our daughter?

1858
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:22,930
So you have a different kid?

1859
01:34:24,630 --> 01:34:28,210
Wait, I think we murdered the other girl.

1860
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:31,750
We killed her in the bathtub.

1861
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:37,570
But also, Japan does not have big bathtubs.

1862
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:38,810
They kind of suck actually.

1863
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:39,690
Really?

1864
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:39,810
Really?

1865
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:41,530
I feel like...

1866
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:45,570
Maybe I have a skewed opinion because all I do... I'm just a weeb.

1867
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:48,390
I think it really depends on what kind of place you get.

1868
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:51,190
Wait, what the hell?

1869
01:34:51,410 --> 01:34:52,250
That's my daughter!

1870
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,110
Wait, what?

1871
01:34:58,590 --> 01:34:59,110
I

1872
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,460
think I'm frozen here.

1873
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:07,800
I'm frozen in fear.

1874
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:09,460
Hug your daughter!

1875
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:15,560
I love you daughter and your polka dot pyjamas.

1876
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:16,820
We

1877
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:23,160
eat hamburgers in the tub.

1878
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,120
How many times do I have to tell you?

1879
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:30,220
Oh, are we going to watch her die?

1880
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:32,620
She's calling...

1881
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,080
Oh, the police.

1882
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:38,780
The police?

1883
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,460
Yeah, the girl was killed by...

1884
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,760
Berry, we were the bad guy.

1885
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,320
We were the bad guy all along!

1886
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,480
Wait, why are you saying we?

1887
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,040
Hey, I'm not...

1888
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,100
Berry, we were the bad guy.

1889
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,460
No, wait, hold on.

1890
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,900
I didn't do anything though.

1891
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,000
Berry, you are complicit in this.

1892
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:16,140
Me?

1893
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:18,640
Yeah, you were here the whole time.

1894
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:20,480
No.

1895
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,840
I like how it was just like, hey, you want to get through the ending?

1896
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:29,420
No, no, no, don't speed up.

1897
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:31,880
Oh, that's fast.

1898
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:33,000
Oh, I hear the police.

1899
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,420
Okay, so what?

1900
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:39,840
We killed the girl and then our daughter snitched us.

1901
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:40,360
Yeah.

1902
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,740
So we killed our daughter?

1903
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:44,800
I think that's it.

1904
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,380
But then why were we trying to bring her back?

1905
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,600
Oh, wait, true.

1906
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:53,380
Well, maybe we were haunted by...

1907
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:58,620
I can't tell if we killed her because she was on the phone and then just collapsed.

1908
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:00,880
And then we came in and were like, what's wrong?

1909
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:06,280
Maybe that's how we got her.

1910
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:07,900
Maybe.

1911
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,080
Oh, we can look in here.

1912
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,800
Oh my god, it's so loud.

1913
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:17,930
Sorry guys, it's so loud.

1914
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:20,890
I'm confused a little bit.

1915
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:27,790
Her daughter had a concussion from playing in the park with her friend.

1916
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:29,770
Wait, what?

1917
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:31,350
Wait.

1918
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:35,090
Is that confirmed knowledge?

1919
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:37,570
Well, because she said her head was like...

1920
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:39,090
Oh, it was hurting, yeah.

1921
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:45,590
Oh, the daughter had an accident in the park while playing with her friend and the dad blamed that friend.

1922
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:51,810
You'll never take me alive!

1923
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:58,770
I'm gonna go into the toilet that Isekai-zu.

1924
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:02,210
Yes, yes.

1925
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:03,430
Do I have to answer the door?

1926
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:04,970
Do I have a gun?

1927
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:06,270
You gotta turn yourself in.

1928
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:06,630
Ah, it's Japan.

1929
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:07,750
You gotta turn yourself in.

1930
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:09,570
It's only right.

1931
01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:11,650
Minto, it's only right.

1932
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:12,830
Ah, man.

1933
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:16,850
No more Inuyasha for you.

1934
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:18,630
You gotta go to jail.

1935
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:21,790
One more episode, mom, please!

1936
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:26,150
I want to change the world!

1937
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:30,410
One ending.

1938
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:31,710
There's only one ending.

1939
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:33,470
That's what the achievement I just got.

1940
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:35,470
Oh, wait.

1941
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:36,450
I'm running for it.

1942
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:39,410
Oh, you mean to dash for it?

1943
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:40,030
Oh, damn!

1944
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,370
I really am just a coward.

1945
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:43,290
Oh my god!

1946
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:47,070
Oh, nevermind.

1947
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:48,010
Oh, bye!

1948
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:49,810
It keeps going.

1949
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:58,510
He did a flip.

1950
01:38:59,010 --> 01:38:59,910
Oh, so did she.

1951
01:39:00,490 --> 01:39:01,730
She was so stiff.

1952
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:02,170
Oh, wait.

1953
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:03,950
What the... Wait, what's going on?

1954
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:08,730
Oh my god, I think Chungus and Chilla just picked up the...

1955
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:10,290
Wait, do you think we were the...

1956
01:39:10,290 --> 01:39:14,470
What did the Chilla... What did that guy have to do with it?

1957
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:16,610
What's going on?

1958
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:21,670
Oh, this was made in Unreal.

1959
01:39:22,010 --> 01:39:23,330
No wonder it's like a little...

1960
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:25,050
Oh, man.

1961
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:31,590
Me when Metal Gear Solid Delta was announced for Unreal.

1962
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:39,010
Wow, we did it!

1963
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:44,940
Oh, spooky, scary game.

1964
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,940
But who was Phone?

1965
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,120
Who was Phone?

1966
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:50,380
Chinchilla.

1967
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,000
Who was the old lady?

1968
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:53,680
Oh, wait.

1969
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,640
You're right.

1970
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:57,260
Who was that?

1971
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,740
It's just some random ass lady.

1972
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:04,580
I guess it was really the landlord.

1973
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:07,200
But who was lady?

1974
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:09,400
Hand or hook car?

1975
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:14,400
The landlord saw us like tweaking out and she was just like, okay, I'm out.

1976
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,740
I'll come back another time.

1977
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,800
Who was that?

1978
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:27,580
Clearly, yeah, it was MataraCon.

1979
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,980
Coming to try and join in on the game club.

1980
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,300
Yeah.

1981
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:34,820
Well, that was fun.

1982
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:35,760
Thank you for having me.

1983
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:37,920
No, I don't think I would have been able to beat the game.

1984
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,280
I wouldn't have been able to do this without you, Perry.

1985
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:41,900
Wow.

1986
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,240
Wow, we're in love with each other.

1987
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:45,760
Wow.

1988
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:47,860
You're in love with me.

1989
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:48,720
Don't say anything.

1990
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:49,420
Let's not go so far.

1991
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,940
Don't say anything, please.

1992
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,220
Thank you for having me.

1993
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:00,880
I'm sorry to barge in.

1994
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,820
No, I asked you to come.

1995
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:07,980
Yeah, but any wisps that are angry at me, you could send an email to me.

1996
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:14,100
No one would be because I'm just a baby with these games.

1997
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:20,600
With the cabin place, I couldn't even listen to it with headphones.

1998
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:21,500
I had to take out my headphones.

1999
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,280
Oh, you don't watch that, Vaude.

2000
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:23,980
No, you don't.

2001
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,040
Did you call for the jump scare thing?

2002
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:27,720
Which one?

2003
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:32,160
The one that was like in the settings, the jump scare on and off thing.

2004
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:33,400
What?

2005
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:40,640
In cabin factory, in the settings, there's like a setting for jump scares on and off and it's on off.

2006
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:44,540
And if you turn it on, it like just immediately jump scares you.

2007
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:46,780
No way!

2008
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:49,080
Did you not get caught?

2009
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:49,500
Wait.

2010
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,000
Nobody told me.

2011
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:53,860
You didn't do that?

2012
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:54,980
Nobody told me.

2013
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:55,860
What?

2014
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,520
Wait, you guys are slacking.

2015
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,360
What the heck?

2016
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,840
Maybe they do love me.

2017
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:04,780
No, you guys.

2018
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,080
Maybe they do love me.

2019
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:12,900
You guys are so sweet.

2020
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,860
My chat like told me to do that almost immediately.

2021
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:25,120
Why would you be like, oh yeah guys, I'll turn the jump scares on.

2022
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,100
That sounds like a better way to play the game.

2023
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:31,880
They were like calling me a coward for having it off and I was like, I didn't even turn it on.

2024
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,260
I can't believe this.

2025
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:39,000
I was literally shivering in my booties though.

2026
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,740
I couldn't do anything in that game.

2027
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,480
I was so scared.

2028
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,000
I gotta watch it then.

2029
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:45,720
No, you don't.

2030
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:47,020
No, don't worry.

2031
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,940
No, you don't.

2032
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:53,560
It was like right before the concert too, so I was already nervous.

2033
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,160
Like the one in Atlanta, so I was just like...

2034
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,800
You were jittering.

2035
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:01,500
I was.

2036
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:03,440
And then I saw you.

2037
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,140
You did.

2038
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,260
We saw each other.

2039
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:08,140
We did.

2040
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:09,400
Wow.

2041
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,660
I totally don't remember what happened.

2042
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,660
I'm just so like...

2043
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:16,120
It's out of my brain now.

2044
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:21,200
Was that good of an experience?

2045
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:24,080
It was awesome.

2046
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,400
It was freaking awesome.

2047
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:27,220
Freaking awesome.

2048
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:29,260
It was freaking epic!

2049
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:37,120
Thank you for having me.

2050
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:38,300
Bye everybody!

2051
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:38,880
Bye!

2052
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:40,160
Thanks Mary!

2053
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:50,100
Freaking epic!

2054
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:54,900
Thanks Mary!

2055
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:59,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2056
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:02,600
Oh my gosh.

2057
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:05,000
Sorry, thank you Mary for being here.

2058
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:10,080
I seriously wouldn't have been able to complete the game, I think, without you being here.

2059
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,060
So I really appreciate you.

2060
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,340
I'll update the title and everything.

2061
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:20,700
And have her socials and stuff for everybody who's like, who dat?

2062
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,680
That's just my friend.

2063
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:27,060
I think this is our first ever quote-unquote collab.

2064
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:29,060
Well no, on my channel at least.

2065
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:34,900
We collabed before on Ashton's channel and we talked about theme parks and stuff.

2066
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:37,220
Uncursing funds.

2067
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:40,320
Yeah, the Disney collab.

2068
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:46,160
She multi-streams on YouTube?

2069
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,040
She does?

2070
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,420
Oh, I didn't know that.

2071
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:50,800
Mary totally says awesomesauce.

2072
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:54,200
I should ask.

2073
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:55,980
Did you say awesomesauce?

2074
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,840
That one was spooky.

2075
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:04,420
That one, I like the...

2076
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:06,420
The what's it called?

2077
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:08,380
I like the atmosphere of this one.

2078
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:10,420
Try Princess?

2079
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:11,280
Thank you!

2080
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:14,200
I like the atmosphere of this one.

2081
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,000
Henya, I didn't know.

2082
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:21,320
What if I became a supporter too and then they put our pictures right next to each other.

2083
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,440
Oh wait, supporter of Henya.

2084
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,580
Wait, this isn't actually Henya?

2085
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:28,480
Henya squad.

2086
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:34,380
Look, this one, this literally could have been me in our papers.

2087
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,360
Could have been touching.

2088
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:37,420
Get away plague daddy!

2089
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,620
Plague mommy, that's me!

2090
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,360
Not Henya, hentai.

2091
01:45:49,620 --> 01:45:50,600
Yeah, it's the hentai.

2092
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:52,700
Helsing game?

2093
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,120
I think I remember seeing this person before.

2094
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:04,400
Don't worry guys, for Delta I'll probably not be playing it on my PC.

2095
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:14,300
So, I'll play it on console so that we can not have any lagging issues.

2096
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,060
Don't worry.

2097
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,040
Yeah, Doki is here too.

2098
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:18,300
We saw her earlier.

2099
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:19,600
Doki bird.

2100
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:21,220
I'm actually gonna update her.

2101
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:23,800
She's the same, but flipped.

2102
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:24,980
She's number three!

2103
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:26,980
Wait, which number is Henya?

2104
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:29,780
Number one!

2105
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:33,120
No, I'll never be next to her!

2106
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,720
This is so funny.

2107
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:40,840
Oh, I like everybody who puts their cats.

2108
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:43,320
Damn.

2109
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:44,920
Okay.

2110
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,160
Okay, Nako.

2111
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:49,440
Some good advertising there.

2112
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,460
I like how it's just this lady.

2113
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:58,600
I like the little tiny stickers too.

2114
01:46:58,700 --> 01:46:59,180
They're fun.

2115
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:02,420
They're fun too.

2116
01:47:03,180 --> 01:47:04,680
Oh, it doesn't...

2117
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:07,340
Oh, you can try to open it, but it doesn't open.

2118
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,520
That's kinda freaky actually.

2119
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:09,740
Can I open the door?

2120
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:10,840
No.

2121
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:14,320
We're just in the lonesome...

2122
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,820
This is such a sad...

2123
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,400
Sad room for a little kid.

2124
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:30,760
Oh, here you're wearing pants, but for me you're like, this is a special occasion.

2125
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,120
Pants off, baby.

2126
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:36,040
Ollie is here.

2127
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:37,700
Ollie?

2128
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:42,120
That's not Ollie.

2129
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:43,960
Ollie.

2130
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:45,980
Ollie.

2131
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:47,940
Ollie.

2132
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:49,600
Ollie.

2133
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,060
Ollie?

2134
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:54,480
I missed her!

2135
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:56,280
Cute!

2136
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:56,720
Cute!

2137
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,700
Went by Google.

2138
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:05,740
Cute!

2139
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:17,820
I like how it's cute when it's a fan that puts their favorite in the game.

2140
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:19,540
So you have a henya.

2141
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:24,580
RIP Google.

2142
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:36,610
It was so dark and messed up even for Chilla's game.

2143
01:48:36,670 --> 01:48:37,930
My theory could be...

2144
01:48:37,930 --> 01:48:39,590
Is Mickey...

2145
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:39,970
Wait.

2146
01:48:40,870 --> 01:48:43,170
Is Mickey the manifestation of your guilt?

2147
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:44,750
I could be completely wrong.

2148
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:48,030
Could be, because she really likes him.

2149
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:49,130
Right?

2150
01:48:50,510 --> 01:48:52,110
He passed away last year.

2151
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:56,010
This was the last gift from Google for Ollie.

2152
01:48:57,850 --> 01:48:58,450
This?

2153
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:01,610
Google was a fan of Ollie that passed away.

2154
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:04,590
That's so sad.

2155
01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:08,070
That's so sweet.

2156
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:10,230
And Ollie played.

2157
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:14,550
I'm sure she saw.

2158
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:18,610
That's so sweet.

2159
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:26,530
That makes me so emotional.

2160
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:26,890
No, no!

2161
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:29,990
And then...

2162
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:32,990
That was probably such a shock to see too.

2163
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:36,190
Ollie cried.

2164
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:37,230
I would too!

2165
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:40,150
She was a big Zomrad.

2166
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,580
I remember seeing Ollie in the other games too.

2167
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:51,100
Was it the same person?

2168
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:54,660
Was it the same Google person?

2169
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,060
Is it loyal to her?

2170
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,640
To her dying breath?

2171
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:08,520
It was the same.

2172
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,520
She's been doing it for a long time then.

2173
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,420
Oh my gosh.

2174
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:19,820
That's so sad.

2175
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:20,960
What a nice memory.

2176
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:23,360
Always have...

2177
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:26,120
Always have them in the game.

2178
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,060
I don't know how to...

2179
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:33,600
I don't know how to...

2180
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:34,860
The mood.

2181
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:39,380
If I die I'm not leaving you anything.

2182
01:50:39,620 --> 01:50:39,920
Okay.

2183
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:40,940
Go to hell.

2184
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,080
See you there.

2185
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:54,260
See you there.

2186
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:01,090
Quit.

2187
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:05,650
That was actually much faster than I expected too.

2188
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:13,170
You can have my cool socks.

2189
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:17,710
I like what they tried to do with the game.

2190
01:51:17,850 --> 01:51:22,990
I honestly prefer horror like this where it's a little more subtle.

2191
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:24,930
And it's more of a build up of atmosphere.

2192
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:29,090
Maybe I could see why people would think this is more boring.

2193
01:51:29,810 --> 01:51:34,690
But I liked walking around and you would sometimes see Chungus Mouse.

2194
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:37,610
And other than that $2.

2195
01:51:37,610 --> 01:51:42,190
If I die you can have my body if you want to.

2196
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:44,370
What would I do with it?

2197
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:45,970
I can't even possess it.

2198
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:50,850
Subtle Chungus.

2199
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:55,850
Yeah, actually there was not really any jump scares in this.

2200
01:51:56,250 --> 01:52:01,110
I felt that I kind of cheesed the final boss fight.

2201
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:02,610
But maybe due to fear.

2202
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:12,770
I didn't realize that I could just stand in the corner and be fine.

2203
01:52:16,950 --> 01:52:17,550
Yippee!

2204
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:18,930
A win's a win.

2205
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:19,970
So true.

2206
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:21,410
Almost everyone cheeses it.

2207
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:22,230
Okay, good.

2208
01:52:25,590 --> 01:52:29,730
I like horror games with subtle lore breadcrumbs like this.

2209
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:36,330
The ending didn't seem so impossible to put together.

2210
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:41,890
At first I was confused but then it was just like, oh, she had a headache.

2211
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:48,290
Her head hurt and then she collapsed because she had the head injury.

2212
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:57,890
And then you kind of find out that maybe the dad lured...

2213
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:02,750
Well, not maybe, I mean the daughter literally said my dad killed my friend.

2214
01:53:03,070 --> 01:53:05,090
And then, yeah, head hurted.

2215
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:08,690
And then...

2216
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:11,470
I actually didn't totally dislike this one.

2217
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:16,110
The game puts you in the corner at the beginning of the fight.

2218
01:53:16,210 --> 01:53:17,650
I think they wanted it to be that way.

2219
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:22,550
Possibly, but I was like, I just don't want to walk around the house in the dark.

2220
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:23,470
It was too scary.

2221
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:26,830
Yeah, head hurted.

2222
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:28,590
Do you have any ibuprofen?

2223
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:32,330
But no, we never found out who that lady was.

2224
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:34,010
Maybe our wife?

2225
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:36,650
But we never even mentioned a wife.

2226
01:53:37,110 --> 01:53:38,430
I don't think we had a wife.

2227
01:53:39,330 --> 01:53:41,170
I don't know who that lady was.

2228
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,610
It's almost like you were cowering in the corner.

2229
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:47,750
That's exactly what it was.

2230
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:48,830
Minto, you cowered?

2231
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:50,130
Yeah, and I'm proud.

2232
01:53:50,650 --> 01:53:52,830
Because I didn't...

2233
01:53:54,130 --> 01:53:55,850
I'm a coward and I'm proud.

2234
01:53:58,330 --> 01:53:59,770
Did I get all the achievements?

2235
01:54:00,230 --> 01:54:01,110
Oh no, I didn't.

2236
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:03,270
Find all mascot.

2237
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:07,330
And then ghost hunter night park.

2238
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:09,170
Take all ghost photos in the park at night time.

2239
01:54:09,310 --> 01:54:10,630
So there's more.

2240
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:13,530
And then there's take all ghost photos at the park in the evening.

2241
01:54:14,510 --> 01:54:16,590
And then take all ghost photos in the apartment.

2242
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:19,230
We missed actually a lot.

2243
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:22,290
I only got two achievements.

2244
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:30,390
Wait, so we didn't even see all the ghost photos.

2245
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:31,870
That's kind of fun.

2246
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:34,530
That's kind of fun.

2247
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:38,030
Proud of you coward.

2248
01:54:39,370 --> 01:54:40,790
Yeah, cowards live.

2249
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:42,210
Cowards live.

2250
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:45,290
Even though I'm already dead.

2251
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:47,150
The phones have a little extra lore.

2252
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:50,650
Like when you call the numbers for the hints.

2253
01:54:51,790 --> 01:54:52,390
Interesting.

2254
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:03,290
But I don't want to go back to the spooky park.

2255
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:10,250
In fact, if you would like to see the rest of the ghosts.

2256
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:19,310
You can watch someone or play it yourself.

2257
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:23,150
Yeah, we'd have to call Barry again.

2258
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:25,810
Let me also thank her.

2259
01:55:26,830 --> 01:55:28,270
Thank you Barry.

2260
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:32,230
It's my birthday, Peregrine!

2261
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:33,590
Happy birthday!

2262
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:37,830
Happy birthday to you.

2263
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:40,650
Happy birthday to you.

2264
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:44,370
Happy birthday dear Peregrine.

2265
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:48,830
Happy birthday to you.

2266
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:53,440
Happy birthday...

2267
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,780
I think I could do the daytime one, but I don't think I could definitely do the nighttime one.

2268
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:07,860
I could maybe do the daytime one, but the nighttime one would be impossible for me.

2269
01:56:08,620 --> 01:56:11,260
Too much in the house?

2270
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:13,360
Not with that lady?

2271
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,280
What happens if she touches you?

2272
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:16,980
I'm so curious.

2273
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:19,020
She came at me.

2274
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:25,460
I'm so like Fatal Frame Brain that if there's a ghost, I take a picture.

2275
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,480
It's my birthday, Raptor!

2276
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:30,460
One more time!

2277
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:33,900
Happy birthday to you.

2278
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:40,760
Happy birthday, Raptor-senpai.

2279
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:45,760
Happy birthday to you.

2280
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:48,700
Happy birthday!

2281
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:52,600
And I'm glad you named your plant after me.

2282
01:56:53,980 --> 01:56:59,180
What kind of a ghost am I to be afraid of other ghosts?

2283
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:00,820
Okay, it's like how you guys...

2284
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:03,520
Humans are afraid of other humans, right?

2285
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:06,580
You guys are probably more afraid of other humans than ghosts.

2286
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,620
You know, I hear that quite often.

2287
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:11,600
Humans are scarier than ghosts, right?

2288
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:14,000
So for me, it's kind of the same.

2289
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:19,700
Where it's just like, I'm more afraid of ghosts because I'm not afraid of humans.

2290
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,240
Makes sense.

2291
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:25,280
Exactly.

2292
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:26,140
Fair.

2293
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:29,840
See?

2294
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,660
You're scared of girls?

2295
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:33,140
That's a personal problem.

2296
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,600
I don't think I can help you with that one.

2297
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:41,540
So...

2298
01:57:41,540 --> 01:57:43,400
But you're actually getting over your fear.

2299
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,720
Maybe I am...

2300
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,480
What's that therapy?

2301
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:48,840
Like immersion therapy?

2302
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:50,640
Exposure therapy?

2303
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:53,560
I'm exposing myself to you.

2304
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:56,220
You're exposing yourself to me.

2305
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:58,200
No, don't do that.

2306
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:09,400
I didn't think that one through.

2307
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:11,280
I'm afraid of no ghosts.

2308
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:14,060
Right.

2309
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,980
What should we bust in tonight?

2310
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:20,580
We just did a ghost.

2311
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:23,900
We just did a spooky stream.

2312
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:24,800
Let's bust in.

2313
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:27,420
Let's bust in.

2314
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,640
It's been a long, long time.

2315
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:31,060
First bust in of the new year.

2316
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,140
Before we end the stream.

2317
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:37,620
My trip to Japan in June now...

2318
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:39,840
Consists of three lives in a row.

2319
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:42,480
With Hashino Sora, Liela and Awkwards.

2320
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:42,980
Oh my god.

2321
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:44,580
I can't wait to destroy my voice.

2322
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,880
What a stacked lineup.

2323
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:49,580
Oh my gosh.

2324
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:51,680
Okay.

2325
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:52,840
Bust in.

2326
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,460
Bust in makes me feel good.

2327
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,500
It's loading?

2328
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:04,220
Why is it taking...

2329
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:13,980
Can you mix this better?

2330
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:15,820
Let

2331
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:28,780
me tell you something.

2332
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:33,300
There is something weird about sleeping in your bed.

2333
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:35,300
Let me tell you something.

2334
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,640
Bust in makes me feel good.

2335
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:42,720
Thank you guys for the stream.

2336
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,300
Bust in!

2337
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:43,720
Bust in!

2338
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:44,380
Bust in!

2339
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:44,900
Bust in!

2340
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:45,400
Bust in!

2341
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:55,680
Bust in!

2342
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:03,800
Torahin, Rintou, Seri, Yamashita, Bust in!

2343
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:13,200
Invisible man.

2344
02:00:13,740 --> 02:00:15,120
Sleeping in your bed.

2345
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:18,120
Let me tell you something...

2346
02:00:21,620 --> 02:00:22,100
Bust in!

2347
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:22,580
Bust in!

2348
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:23,120
Bust in!

2349
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:23,620
Bust in!

2350
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:24,160
Bust in!

2351
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:24,660
Bust in!

2352
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:29,720
Bust in makes me feel good.

2353
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:39,340
Bust in!

2354
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:39,900
Bust in!

2355
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:40,440
Bust in!

2356
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,440
Bust in!

2357
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:45,080
Bust in!

2358
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,620
Feel good!

2359
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:47,620
Feel good!

2360
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:48,620
Feel good!

2361
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,620
Feel good!

2362
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:51,680
Feel good!

2363
02:00:51,780 --> 02:00:53,580
Happy Lunar New Year!

2364
02:00:56,740 --> 02:00:58,100
Freaky Ghostmade!

2365
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:02,600
Freaky Ghostman!

2366
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:06,460
Freaky man, baby!

2367
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:09,040
Thanks, Fakeny!

02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:14,120
If you're all alone, let me sleep in your bed.

2369
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,300
Let me tell you something.

2370
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:23,380
Sleeping makes me feel good!

2371
02:01:26,770 --> 02:01:28,880
I ain't afraid of no sleep.

2372
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:31,360
I ain't afraid of no bed.

2373
02:01:35,370 --> 02:01:37,050
An invisible bed.

2374
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:40,030
Freaky Ghostbed!

2379
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:03,640
Busted!

2380
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:04,060
Busted!

2381
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:05,640
Busted!

2382
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:15,480
