1
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,200
Fireworks!

2
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,060
Oh my god!

3
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:50,940
Fireworks!

4
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,840
Right

5
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,720
in front of me!

6
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,720
What are you talking about?

7
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,900
What are you talking about?

8
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,680
They are right there!

9
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,340
We are looking at the fireworks together.

10
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,060
Look!

11
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,300
Wait,

12
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,560
hold on.

13
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,920
I forgot to change the settings.

14
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,740
There we go.

15
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,980
Anyways, guys!

16
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,180
Hello!

17
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,500
Today, you are getting all my back.

18
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,660
You got my back, right guys?

19
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,000
You've got my back!

20
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,440
You've got my back!

21
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,760
You've got my back!

22
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,660
Today is my back.

23
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,100
Meet those back!

24
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,680
Can I snap the straps like a middle school... No!

25
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,740
Minky3D, hi!

26
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,660
I felt like, I don't know, I wanna look at the fireworks.

27
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,940
But I wanted to look at them properly, so I had to be facing the fireworks.

28
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,140
There's gonna be a lot of stuff.

29
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,740
So...

30
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,820
I don't know, it's just for fun.

31
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,800
Don't feel like I'm gonna do this a lot or anything.

32
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,360
Until maybe I get my real 3D.

33
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,380
But for now, you know.

34
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,580
There's gonna be a little bit of stuff.

35
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,820
A little teensy, teensy bit.

36
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,220
You can't really see my hands, because my sleeves are so big.

37
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,380
You can kinda... Look at that!

38
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,620
Look, I'm typing!

39
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,220
I'm hacking.

40
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,240
Petal, petal, meet those back.

41
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,340
No, no, no, no, no, no.

42
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,080
Don't make me come over there.

43
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,400
Your neck, your back, and then a couple of other things.

44
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,280
You're gonna break... Step on a crack, break Minto's back.

45
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,140
Don't do that, don't do that.

46
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:08,840
So yeah, today we'll be playing Fireworks Mania with Doki, with Snuffy, with Limu!

47
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,440
They're all set up, they're all waiting for me.

48
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:20,020
I said I wanted to talk to you guys first.

49
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,460
Sorry, my arms are gonna be quite scuffed, but they kinda work a little bit.

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you like my hat?

51
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,440
Fireworks!

52
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,680
And it's gonna be totally normal, it's gonna be totally chill fireworks time.

53
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,660
Don't worry about it.

54
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,520
Tickly fingers.

55
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,000
The game title makes me think it was a spiritual successor to an old PopCap game.

56
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,180
What's that?

57
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,220
PopCap, which one is that?

58
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,720
Quick while she's looking away, MitoQ.

59
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,900
No, I can see, I can see, I can see!

60
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,880
Would you show the wisp your middle finger?

61
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,120
That's it.

62
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,280
That's my middle finger.

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,280
This is my index finger.

64
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,980
This is my middle finger.

65
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,360
I don't know why...

66
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,680
It's so small, it's like a worm.

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,060
How high can you raise your arms by the way?

68
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,980
Not...

69
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,220
Don't look!

70
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,240
Oh my gosh, higher than I thought.

71
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,200
Wait.

72
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,140
What if I... Wait, hold on.

73
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,320
Wait, my arm, my... Hold on.

74
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,600
Okay, okay.

75
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,880
Wait, but my arm is...

76
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,320
My arm is... My arm is blocking it.

77
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,380
So we'll just have it like this.

78
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,080
Fireworks with a Mito blush.

79
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,900
With Mito and with three other people and all of you guys.

80
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,280
So let's... I'm gonna jump into the call and we're just gonna have fun with it.

81
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,120
I've never played this game before, but it recently got multiplayer.

82
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,640
And it seems a little chaotic, so yeah.

83
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,540
She hates us so much she won't even look back at a shot.

84
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,300
Okay.

85
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,920
Okie dokie!

86
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,260
I'm coming in!

87
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,080
Nice timing.

88
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,560
What happened?

89
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,780
Hey gang, hey!

90
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,520
Hi!

91
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,500
My audio is all out of whack.

92
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,300
You have to... Wait, like on stream or like on the in-game?

93
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,640
On stream.

94
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,720
Okay, yeah, I was gonna say the audio for the game is like, you have to change the input.

95
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,340
Oh wait, is it in-game audio?

96
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,840
Oh yeah, there is in-game audio.

97
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,780
Okay, we'll do that then.

98
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,000
Probably, right?

99
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,440
Yeah.

100
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,980
Oh that's great, I can eat and you guys won't hear me.

101
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,680
Oh shit.

102
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,920
My chat will hear me, they'll judge me.

103
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,180
I just spilled my tea!

104
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,840
Did you get the link?

105
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,620
Did you click the link?

106
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,220
Let me... clicky clicky link.

107
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,160
I see it now.

108
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,580
Join session.

109
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,680
Snuffy, do you still talk to AI Laimu?

110
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,700
No dude, she was nothing in comparison to the real thing.

111
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,780
Comment AIL.

112
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,060
Pathetic.

113
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,580
Twisted feet.

114
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
We're in!

115
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,340
I see them, I see them in their chats.

116
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,440
Alright, now Snuffy's chat can expose Laimu.

117
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,660
Expose Snuffy to Laimu.

118
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,740
She does talk to AI.

119
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,160
Hell yeah.

120
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,240
Laimu chat knows how freaky I am.

121
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,800
They'll worry.

122
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,820
Chat, behave!

123
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,840
Be nice!

124
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,120
Get along with other chat.

125
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,860
Wait, you guys can combine chats?

126
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
They're always super nice.

127
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,660
Yeah, they're kissing right now.

128
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,080
Yeah, on Twitch you can combine, if you're collabing, you can combine your streams together.

129
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,340
So the numbers are also combined as well as the chat.

130
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,700
It's like a proper co-op.

131
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,000
We're gaming the system.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,260
Yes, we're gaming the system.

133
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,640
They're gonna be the number one streamers for Fireworks Media.

134
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,680
It's a very competitive field, I'll have you know.

135
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
We need this boost, okay?

136
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,740
There's gonna be two people streaming Fireworks Media.

137
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,080
There's someone streaming Fireworks Media!

138
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,340
It's us, it's us!

139
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,260
We have to dominate Fireworks Media.

140
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,000
Sorry, Batman.

141
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,820
Sorry, Batman.

142
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,100
We're like the Joker coming in.

143
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,280
I hope this will get people interested in the game and they'll browse by category and realize there's only one person.

144
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,380
All interested in the game category will go straight towards Batman.

145
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,680
Not only is he Batman, he's German Batman.

146
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,100
Nice.

147
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,280
Okay, just ignore that, that's fine.

148
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,480
I don't know what that means in German, I'm not German.

149
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm gonna pretend I know what you said.

150
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,600
I won't tell you then.

151
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,140
Mint, you don't even have a placeholder Twitch, do you?

152
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,880
Do you have a placeholder Twitch I can put in my title?

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
Oh, I do.

154
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,440
People think it's fake.

155
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,500
I don't remember it, hold on.

156
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,120
It could be fake.

157
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,120
It's made mint underscore channel.

158
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,040
Oh wait, CH, not channel.

159
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,740
CH.

160
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,300
Made mint underscore CH.

161
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,260
Oh, the power move with no display picture or anything fantastic.

162
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,800
Oh my god, how did these 492 people found your channel?

163
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,760
I've used it to chat before, but I usually get timed out in people's chat.

164
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,080
They're just like, that's not real.

165
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,240
Well, look at this faker pretending to be mint that's fucked up.

166
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,980
Let me just VIP you so if you ever do show up, my mods don't kill you.

167
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,840
There's like a lot of German servers in the map for this game.

168
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,580
The Germans really love this game.

169
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,360
I see like literally 1, 2, 3, 4 German servers.

170
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,260
Oh my god.

171
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:22,420
By the way, there's not a lot of servers, but there's like 1 third of this is German.

172
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
What in the multiplayer?

173
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,700
Yeah, in the multiplayer, you look in there and you see...

174
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,200
Oh, German.

175
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,540
There's like a German town.

176
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,260
There's like...

177
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:46,820
There's Thomas, Tom, Emil, there's Dad, there's... I'm pretty sure it was MaxterGal, that has to be German, right?

178
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,560
I love German, like with the exclamation points.

179
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,880
No wonder German Batman was there.

180
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,560
Oh my gosh, someone in my chat just said Batman stream gained 30 viewers.

181
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,840
Hell yeah.

182
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,760
We're doing it.

183
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,960
It's like all 30 German people watching us are like, oh, okay, I'm gonna go watch in my native language.

184
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,420
Yeah, I can't understand what they're saying.

185
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,900
At least I can relate to him.

186
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,720
I do like the one that's like, yo, I have hundreds of mods and you can set off like 10 million fireworks, you're freaking wild.

187
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,540
That's my favorite.

188
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,600
Oh, if only...

189
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,500
Is that something in Batman stream?

190
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,760
Yeah, Batman stream... No, Batman just gained lots of viewers because we mentioned him.

191
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,600
Shout out to Batman.

192
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,840
Shout out to Batman.

193
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,720
Shout out to German Batman.

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,720
I hope he's saving Germany right now.

195
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,960
People are gifting your channel subs to us.

196
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,860
Yeah, thanks for getting a sub to Mint.

197
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,380
Oh, thank you!

198
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,840
I didn't realize that this game feels like there's a lot of people talking about mods.

199
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,620
I'm assuming people mod the shit out of this game.

200
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,280
I guess so.

201
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,700
I mean, literally, it's like...

202
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,340
Firework mods.

203
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,620
This server... I know you're the first servers in your life.

204
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:08,120
This server is 125 mods and a limit of... what the f... a hundred... a million fireworks?

205
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,780
So join and play?

206
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,800
If only there was four spots we could join them.

207
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,740
I'm gonna leave you guys for this server.

208
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,040
Wait, I'm refreshing.

209
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,180
It's full.

210
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Too bad for you.

211
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:26,900
I'm

212
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,420
the only one that's not streaming, so I'm gonna say, hey guys, look at this cool ass...

213
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
Wait, another German server just popped up.

214
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,420
It is a server with cool mods, apparently.

215
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,260
Are the mods, like, local then?

216
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,660
Because that seems kind of dangerous.

217
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,760
Like, you join a server and it's just like a load of swinging dicks or something.

218
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:57,900
I swear to God, if our fans suddenly bought fireworks because I mentioned this server...

219
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,060
I swear to God, guys.

220
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,200
How dare you take my cool server.

221
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,700
They could.

222
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,140
It's on sale.

223
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
Steam sale right now.

224
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,060
I think that'd be so cool.

225
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,520
People could mod, like, our emotes as fireworks.

226
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,500
What is the resolution on this game?

227
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,600
What is the resolution?

228
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,860
Wait, are you guys serious?

229
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,860
I'm not on a server.

230
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,320
I'm just sitting on the menu waiting and watching the German servers.

231
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,800
What the heck is this default resolution?

232
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,380
It's like...

233
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,220
What is it?

234
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,940
I'm not asking.

235
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,320
4000x500.

236
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,000
It's horizontal.

237
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,200
It starts so...

238
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,260
Mine is fine.

239
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,260
No, I'm looking...

240
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,140
Yeah, mine's fine.

241
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,660
This is the regular version.

242
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,520
Like, this is it by default.

243
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,760
I screenshotted it.

244
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,300
This is what it looks like.

245
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,180
I can't...

246
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,220
I don't...

247
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,320
Let me see.

248
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,700
Let me see how to...

249
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,060
Do you have, like, an extra long monitor?

250
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,660
No.

251
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,160
No.

252
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,700
It's very horizontal.

253
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,000
Why does it look like that?

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,400
It wasn't like that at all.

255
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,640
What was that?

256
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
Now it went back when I tabbed into it.

257
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,580
I'll show you guys.

258
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,160
YouTube.

259
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,200
YouTube.

260
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,480
Hello, YouTube.

261
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,780
We're streaming on the YouTube.

262
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,840
Hold on.

263
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,140
I'm gonna become a part of your stream now.

264
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,700
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,340
I'm part of stuff.

266
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,580
We're streaming streams.

267
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
Fireworks radio.

268
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,180
That's me over there.

269
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,600
Looking good.

270
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,080
Oh, you know what?

271
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,340
I do want to open your stream.

272
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,000
I want to see how your 3D looks.

273
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
How's your 3D?

274
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,580
I'm touching your face right now.

275
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,620
I'm gonna go look at it.

276
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,340
Let's all go watch it.

277
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,900
I can sense the phantom touch.

278
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,120
It's extra strong.

279
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,500
No fear.

280
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,360
Cause she's a phantom.

281
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,360
She's a phantom.

282
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,920
You're caressing her.

283
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,480
I see.

284
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,340
Oh, wait.

285
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,340
Oh, Snuffy.

286
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,180
Oh, Snuffy.

287
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,880
Oh, Snuffy.

288
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,980
To be blessed with amazement.

289
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,180
Oh, Snuffy.

290
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,700
Oh, Snuffy.

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
Hey, what's going on?

292
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,860
Picking your nose, Snuffy.

293
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,620
Digging for gold.

294
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,840
Yeah, up in there.

295
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,620
Don't pick her nose.

296
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,680
I see what you're doing.

297
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,960
You're flying.

298
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,740
I got your nose.

299
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,200
Doki, do you want to make this server since you're not streaming?

300
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,620
Wait, why am I making?

301
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,880
Cause you're not streaming.

302
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,340
Ok, ok.

303
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,800
Yeah, that's true.

304
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,360
That's true.

305
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,240
Clap, clap.

306
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,700
Snap, snap.

307
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:44,920
Come on.

308
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,680
Come on.

309
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,540
Your computer has all the resources to spare for this incredibly intensive firework server.

310
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,780
Yeah, and give us a million mods.

311
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:55,940
Alright.

312
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,740
I don't even think I can do mods.

313
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
I have to download it from the fucking work.

314
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,740
How do you do it?

315
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, is that how you do it?

316
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,540
I'm really looking at it.

317
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,360
They don't have Germantown.

318
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
I think that's a mod.

319
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,320
I was gonna do Germantown.

320
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,980
I was looking at, wait, there was one, the ski resort.

321
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,620
What's that one?

322
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,880
That one might be Christmas-y.

323
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,980
Wait, do they have a workshop or is it like externally hosted mods?

324
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,200
Cause I don't see a workshop page.

325
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,660
Oh, you don't?

326
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
I don't either actually.

327
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,440
No.

328
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,440
Mod.io.

329
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,020
Ok.

330
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,040
Alright, I'm making sure it's four players.

331
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,380
Oh, I can make it a join code.

332
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,360
Max allow spawn props per player.

334
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,280
Let's make it 50.

335
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,240
Wait, it says, oh, it says workshop on the left on the main screen.

336
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,580
Yeah, I know, but I don't want to download.

337
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,620
Oh, yeah, ok, mod.io.

338
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,460
Ok.

339
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,660
Literally, Limu said that.

340
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,560
50.

341
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,320
Ok.

342
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,860
I was on like the main page.

343
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,600
I didn't see it.

344
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,680
Alright.

345
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,440
Oh, yeah.

346
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,360
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,300
Read terms of use.

348
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,100
I don't actually want to read.

349
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,660
Oh, Jesus.

350
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,980
Alright, let's see.

351
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,920
How do I invite?

352
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,040
Where the fuck is the code?

353
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,160
Where?

354
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,580
Literally, most of the mods are just like adding so many types of fireworks.

355
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,660
Alright, here we go.

356
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,730
You sent it?

357
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,110
Yeah, I did.

358
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,710
Ok.

359
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,530
I cannot get out of the fucking mod page.

360
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,190
Ok, there we go.

361
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,830
Multiplayer.

362
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,010
Got join code.

363
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,330
Wait, is it gonna show?

364
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:46,990
Does it show it?

365
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,370
It does, so don't capture until you do.

366
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:50,890
Ok, ok.

367
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,930
Oh God, I'm in the sky.

368
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,930
Am I a firework?

369
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,370
No, I'm no longer a firework.

370
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,350
There we go.

371
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:55,730
Good boy.

372
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,070
No mods will be loaded.

373
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,630
Ok, join.

374
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,510
Wait, accept terms of use.

375
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,830
Why do I have to accept the terms of use?

376
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,570
We don't even have mods, do we?

377
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,030
No.

378
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,770
No, I can't do a mods right now.

379
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,270
I have to accept the terms of use for the workshop, even if we don't have them.

380
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,810
That's funny.

381
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,250
I'm here.

382
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,470
Ok, I'm coming in.

383
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,570
Wait.

384
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,090
Oh, I'm in the sky, dude.

385
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,050
Oh my God, my sensitivity is so high in this game.

386
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,540
The footsteps are so loud.

387
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:47,600
Oh.

388
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,080
Wait, I set one off on the floor.

389
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,420
How do you guys set it off?

390
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,100
Am I just spawning it in?

391
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,160
This looks like a legal activity.

392
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,720
No, I'm pretty sure fireworks are illegal in America, isn't it?

393
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,120
No.

394
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,700
What the heck?

395
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,040
We have 4th of July.

396
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,160
What are you talking about?

397
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,480
But, like, not on 4th of July.

398
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,810
Depends on the area.

399
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,470
I don't know if you know this, but you are muted.

400
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,710
Yeah.

401
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,270
Wait, wait, wait, guys.

402
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,470
I'll be right back real quick.

403
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,910
I gotta make a work call.

404
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,510
Hello.

405
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,210
I don't know since...

406
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:41,470
What?

407
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,270
Since this is touching you.

408
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,610
I realized you were super quiet.

409
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,510
Guys, I'll be back in like 5 minutes.

410
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,030
I have a super important work call I forgot about.

411
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:51,810
Okay.

412
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:01,430
Wait, can the rest of us spawn fireworks or are we now just cursed to wander this town without fireworks?

413
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,490
There has to be more.

414
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,290
There's gotta be more somewhere.

415
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,570
I have so many good one-liners.

416
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:08,950
Wait, what?

417
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,170
Wait, wait, did you just think we were ignoring your wit or something?

418
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,030
You just thought we hated you or something?

419
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,790
No, I would never think that.

420
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,810
I'm usually quiet, so I just... I don't think anything.

421
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,790
That's okay.

422
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,630
I'll get it next time.

423
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,230
Wait, I can speed the time.

424
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,070
How do I do that?

425
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,850
Speed time.

426
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,850
Flashlight on.

427
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,110
Oh.

428
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,450
Speed time.

429
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,470
I was just gonna say that it was funny.

430
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,730
We're a bunch of dudes in hoodies, like, lighting off fireworks with lighters in the corner.

431
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,030
I know.

432
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,590
It looks so illegal.

433
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,710
We're causing a disturbance in a civilian neighborhood.

434
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,430
How'd you get that?

435
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,550
We're a bunch of ruffians.

436
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,650
Amazing granny.

437
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,910
Hit tab for the...

438
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,170
I found America-themed fireworks.

439
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,310
Wait, how do I let go of the fireworks?

440
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,010
I'm gonna explode.

441
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,690
Oh god, how do I let go of the fire...

442
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,530
How do I let go of the fireworks?

443
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,950
Ooh, ah...

444
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,050
Oh!

445
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,870
Did you just kill me?

446
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,830
I think I just killed Toki.

447
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,150
What?

448
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,190
How do I light this box?

449
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,230
Oh, Jesus!

450
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,050
Oh, my gosh!

451
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,030
Oh, my gosh!

452
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,230
Oh, my gosh!

453
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,950
Oh, where'd you guys go?

454
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:28,430
It's a slammer!

455
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,430
Wait, I'm lighting the slammer.

456
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,530
How do I light the messenger?

457
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,490
It's not lighting.

458
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,630
I think it's lighting!

459
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:54,530
I don't think we're very good at firework safety.

460
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,170
Oh my god, you can't light it and hold yourself in it.

461
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,130
You'll fly away.

462
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,570
You'll fly away.

463
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,130
Fly away now.

464
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,110
You'll just fly.

465
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,170
Fly away.

466
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,030
How do I just grab this?

467
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,070
How do you get the more fireworks?

468
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,050
What did you do?

469
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,250
What?

470
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,790
Hit tab.

471
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,750
Hit tab and then you can light the box.

472
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,850
Oh, thick billy.

473
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,210
Thick billy!

474
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:17,830
There he goes.

475
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,910
He made fireworks, I just wanna talk.

476
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,570
More billies.

477
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,730
Oh, I spawned too many.

478
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,290
I'm across town now.

479
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,990
I'll start walking back.

480
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:28,570
Oh my god!

481
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,830
I'm gonna explode Doki.

482
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,710
Okay, hold on.

483
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,790
There's a gas station.

484
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,990
I'm gonna light a fire.

485
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,890
How do I get it?

486
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,430
Someone's computer is gonna crash.

487
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,730
Jesus Christ.

488
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,610
Oh my goodness.

489
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,430
Alright, here we go.

490
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,150
Come on Doki.

491
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,550
Wait, did you guys... I don't see you anymore.

492
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,950
How do I plant this shit in the floor?

493
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,070
I don't know, I was trying to figure that too.

494
00:24:59,310 --> 00:24:59,750
Maybe...

495
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,670
Wait, connect fireworks with different types of fuses.

496
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,330
Hold the fucking phone.

497
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,790
What?

498
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,210
Let's go Minecraft redstone.

499
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,310
Wait, I'm connecting all the thick billies.

500
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,030
Give me a minute.

501
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,170
Throw, rotate, hold.

502
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,190
The gas station is immune.

503
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,230
Actually no, I did blow it up though.

504
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,710
Alright, here we go Doki.

505
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,610
We're going together.

506
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,670
I made a ring of thick billies.

507
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,350
Here we go Doki.

508
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,330
Wait, can I make her shoot off the map?

509
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,630
This is my homework now.

510
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,030
This is what I want to do.

511
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,810
Oh my god!

512
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,530
Ok, you should definitely link them together.

513
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,270
It's really funny.

514
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,110
Oh my god, oh my god.

515
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,010
Wait, how do you link?

516
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:55,730
How do you link things?

517
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,550
So, the third one and then you like...

518
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,890
You find where the connection point is and you click them together.

519
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,790
Ok, let's see.

520
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,130
Wait, you what?

521
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,230
What?

522
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,250
So hit three and you'll see it has like a little stick.

523
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,230
And then you see on each firework there's like a little connection point.

524
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,770
Click between them.

525
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,890
And now they're linked.

526
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,430
Right click to stop.

527
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,770
I found a tube.

528
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,510
I don't know what the tube is for.

529
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,670
Oh my god!

530
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,260
Alright then.

531
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,440
Oh my god, is this fireworks?

532
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,880
I don't know.

533
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,600
I think these are for holding them up.

534
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,760
Oh, maybe.

535
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,160
Because the ones that are just shooting across are like...

536
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,100
The ones that are supposed to be in the ground are just shooting away.

537
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,420
Yeah, I don't know how to do it though.

538
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,240
Ok, drop.

539
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:04,960
What are you guys doing?

540
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,560
We figured out how to link fireworks together, which is very nice.

541
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,600
You gotta put the fireworks in first, Oxcapper.

542
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,360
I got a cake.

543
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,420
What the heck?

544
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, happy birthday!

545
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,300
A cake?

546
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,140
It's 2022, let's go!

547
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,420
Happy 2022, happy new year!

548
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,520
Here we go!

549
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,580
Do you like this?

550
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,100
Wait, I think I'll get candles.

551
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,440
Minecraft!

552
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,900
This is so cool!

553
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, I thought they were just blocks.

554
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,340
Minecraft.

555
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,560
I'm making a thing.

556
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,200
Why is a gingerbread man here?

557
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,260
That's me, bro.

558
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,000
That's me, yo!

559
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,700
Merry freaking Christmas!

560
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,900
Am I blue Santa?

561
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,420
Yeah, you're blue Santa!

562
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm blue Santa!

563
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,620
Oh my god, Santa!

564
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,140
Wait, let's blow it up.

565
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,060
Santa.

566
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,320
Wait, can you blow up Santa?

567
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,320
Where are you, Santa?

568
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,060
I looked away for two seconds to link my fireworks.

569
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,540
Why am I not Santa?

570
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,500
I like how this is...

571
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,860
It's literally almost Christmas, what do you mean?

572
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,540
It's like five days till Christmas!

573
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,680
Merry Christmas!

574
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,720
Senpai!

575
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,980
Senpai, I'm late for school!

576
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:22,920
Oh no.

577
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,480
Oh my god.

578
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,120
I might die, actually.

579
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,460
Novelty.

580
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,820
Oh my god.

581
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,060
What exactly did they update?

582
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,980
What do you mean?

583
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,820
They updated stuff, so what exactly did they update?

584
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,680
Have you played this game before?

585
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Mint said they updated this game, that's why we're playing it.

586
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,360
What?

587
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,100
They added multiplayer.

588
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,640
Multiplayer?

589
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,440
Oh my god!

590
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,640
Merry Christmas!

591
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,980
Merry Christmas!

592
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,560
Oh my god, there's so much stuff.

593
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,980
How do I become a different character?

594
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,620
Click the avatar when you hit TAB.

595
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,720
Mac supplier.

596
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,660
I can teleport, I can kick you guys because I'm a server leader.

597
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,020
No, don't do it!

598
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,640
Wait, we can be fast food girls again.

599
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,280
That's fantastic.

600
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,120
Yeah, that's fine.

601
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,100
Here we go, everybody!

602
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,060
I am the sky.

603
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,880
I have a present for you guys.

604
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,880
What's this?

605
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,820
It's my present.

606
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,880
Mr. Beats.

607
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,340
Guys, Merry Christmas!

608
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,720
What is it?

609
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,440
What is it?

610
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,980
It's nothing, it's just a box.

611
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,080
I'm gonna put this...

612
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,640
It's not the best present of them all, it's just a box.

613
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,980
Wait, oh my god!

614
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,340
Why are you so squeamish?

615
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,680
Oh my god, that's what happens when you crouch?

616
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,960
Yeah, that's what happens when you crouch!

617
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,780
This is how crouching works!

618
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,140
Oh wait, I can stand on top of you!

619
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,160
What?

620
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,220
Snuffy crouch, snuffy crouch, I wanna see what crouching is.

621
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,020
Control, left control.

622
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,880
Why does this look like a cigarette?

623
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,940
What the fuck is a pollutant?

624
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,980
Stop stabbing me with it.

625
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,240
It's just a chill guy.

626
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,320
Oh, is it?

627
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,080
Is it the devil's lettuce?

628
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,840
Is this the devil's lettuce?

629
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,100
No, it's not.

630
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,740
What is that?

631
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,120
Is that like a fire?

632
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,700
Snuffy, why are you laughing about it then?

633
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,360
Well, I was the cigarette guy, I just said he's a chill guy.

634
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,540
We can't stand the Christmas trees back up, they're just stuck here now.

635
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,800
No you can't, you press 4 and then you click on it.

636
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,120
I wanna make a really fast...

637
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,200
We should have like a competition, like who makes the most festive looking...

638
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:02,620
You want me to do something other than spawn in stupid amounts of things and then link it all together and try and crash my own computer?

639
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,540
That sounds dumb, I'm not sure about that idea.

640
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,940
It's the best idea.

641
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,820
How do you put stuff in the ground?

642
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,040
How do I make funny shapes?

643
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,260
That's when I spawned them and it said spawn static and it seemed to work.

644
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,020
Why is this one locked?

645
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,180
Fear of the dark.

646
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,620
I like how you can hold the rockets as they're going off, this seems very dangerous.

647
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,040
Oh, there we go.

648
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,340
Yeah, I know, right?

649
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,220
Let's light them up.

650
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,500
Wait, I'm gonna connect them.

651
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,760
No, wait!

652
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,760
Oh my god, wake up, rocket jump!

653
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,980
I don't know where they go!

654
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,020
We were all dead at the end, you get...

655
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh my god, y'all got blown away.

656
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,120
I'm on the other side of town!

657
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,440
What happened to the gas station?

658
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,060
Why is the pump all fucked up?

659
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,460
I blew it up.

660
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,660
You blew it up?

661
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,860
You can blow up houses and stuff?

662
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,340
Wait, can you actually?

663
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,220
I think I need to framerate cap this game.

664
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,120
Dude, I'm on top of the Everest!

665
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,440
Oh my god, I stink!

666
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:31,800
Did you guys hear about how Mount Everest is getting too stinky because people are just leaving their poop on the mountain?

667
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,900
Also, they're leaving their dead bodies up there.

668
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:45,100
Apparently, Mount Everest became such a tourist destination for people that there's a conga line to climb the mountain.

669
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,600
I feel like that's...

670
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,340
The scariest thing about Everest is the line that you get of just like, try not to freeze to death while you wait in line.

671
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,060
No, but then...

672
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:05,660
The government has literally made a PSA to be like, please carry your poop back down the mountain.

673
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,840
Because the mountain is getting really fucking stinky now.

674
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,560
We need you to carry it down.

675
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,660
Is that a thing?

676
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,580
Do you have to like, pack it up somewhere?

677
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,640
I don't know professional hiking.

678
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,680
Yeah, because if you leave it on the mountain, it's there forever.

679
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,960
Yeah, but that's just living.

680
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,420
You can poop on the outside and that should be okay.

681
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,340
What happens if you set fireworks off inside of this house?

682
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,980
That's what I'm about to do, baby.

683
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,520
Well, actually, I'm smoking these people out of their house.

684
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,840
Oh my god, there's a pizza on the roof!

685
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,620
Wait, this is the freaking bat house!

686
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,320
I'm literally at the freaking bat house!

687
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,140
There's a pizza on the roof!

688
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,880
Look, look where I am, guys!

689
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,420
Smoke bomb!

690
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,600
Ninja!

691
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,440
Warrior!

692
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,940
Oh wait, you're right in this house.

693
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,180
Jesus Christ!

694
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,500
Oh wait, you're in this house!

695
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,580
What the fuck?

696
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,320
Oh my god!

697
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,100
Oh my god!

698
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Oh my god!

699
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,540
Oh my god!

700
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,020
Oh my god!

701
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,220
Oh my god!

702
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,500
Oh my god!

703
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:21,520
Oh my god!

704
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,420
Are you alive?

705
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,480
Are you alive?

706
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,360
I'm okay!

707
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,980
What happened?

708
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,520
I actually threw down the house!

709
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,060
What did you do?

710
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,640
I threw down the firework store, you guys!

711
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,380
You blew up the firework store?

712
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,540
There's nothing left?

713
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,000
There's literally nothing left?

714
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,300
You live with yourself after that.

715
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,500
The sign is over here!

716
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,900
It's the only thing that's left!

717
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,240
Holy shit, God!

718
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,160
Oh my god!

719
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,420
My eyes!

720
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,400
I can't see!

721
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,500
It was so bright!

722
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,200
I didn't realize you could burn stuff down!

723
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,660
Snuffy, you know what was amazing?

724
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:08,820
I rounded the corner and there was just this gingerbread man illuminated by the fire with only fucking destruction.

725
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,120
It was so hard.

726
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:18,600
It was like that meme of that little girl looking back after she left that pretty house.

727
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,400
I didn't think it would work but they just started catching each other.

728
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,240
Oh my god!

729
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,280
I want to try it now.

730
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,260
I'm going to the church.

731
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,040
Oh my god!

732
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,480
I did wonder, because you were silent for a while.

733
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,680
I was like, what is she doing?

734
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,400
It would have taken a long time to build this.

735
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,280
I was like, you guys were like, I'm going to blow up a house so I was like, yeah, let me walk into one of these places and see what they got.

736
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,640
And I was like, oh, a fire restore.

737
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,780
Can I actually light up the display fire?

738
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,720
Wait, do you have a propane tank?

739
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,200
Can you actually light something and hit the propane tank and have it explode?

740
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,080
The fireworks came, but instead we just started lighting propane tanks inside people's houses.

741
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,580
This is much more interesting.

742
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,820
Mint, mint.

743
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,240
Yeah?

744
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,420
Are you committing arson in the church?

745
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,860
My wedding is not ready yet.

746
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,080
Would you like some help?

747
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,320
I can add some stuff.

748
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,140
I'm going to make sure.

749
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,400
I want to see if it lights the propane tank.

750
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,080
It warns us when you spawn so many items in a short period of time.

751
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,540
It's like, by the way, Joki just spawned 10 items within 3 seconds.

752
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,920
I know.

753
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,120
Joki, it says that only you can access blueprints.

754
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,520
I don't know if it's something fun, but it says you can do blueprints.

755
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,660
Can you?

756
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,700
It sounds like a war.

757
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,700
Guys, you can light a propane tank, by the way.

758
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,320
It exploded in front of me.

759
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,240
It's all gone.

760
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,540
Are we going to have a...

761
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,340
Are you guys performing the nativity scene?

762
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,200
A scene, yeah.

763
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,660
I made Mary out of doom booms.

764
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,860
Where are you guys?

765
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,340
Come to the church!

766
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,960
There's a church?

767
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,980
Yeah, well, there won't be him anymore.

768
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,780
What does a church look like?

769
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,660
Why are there shells?

770
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,000
Are these shotgun shells?

771
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,900
What do these do?

772
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,640
Oh, I see.

773
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,480
I see the church.

774
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,980
I can't tell if they're going to blow up each other because they're in proximity.

775
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,240
Is that what happened with you, Snuffy?

776
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,980
Yeah, I just lit up a few in the whole building.

777
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,500
I just got a slowdown notification.

778
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,240
Alright, guys.

779
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,320
Slowdown notification.

780
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,220
Baby fireworks.

781
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,580
This is so real.

782
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,340
Oh my god!

783
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,180
Are these real propane tanks?

784
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,420
I've reached the limit of how many fireworks I can spawn in the game.

785
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,760
It was 50.

786
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,660
I gave you guys 50.

787
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,700
Well, I've reached that limit!

788
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,260
Alright, I'm ready.

789
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,860
I'm throwing some in here.

790
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,980
What makes a lot of fun?

791
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,260
Mail toes.

792
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,080
Mail toes?

793
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,620
Mail toes and some lady fingers?

794
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,880
Oh, I get it.

795
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,460
Lady fingers and mail toes.

796
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,380
Wait, give me the lady fingers.

797
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,440
Oh, I reached my limit too.

798
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,080
Alright.

799
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,560
Let me do some rockets.

800
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,220
We'll do some strobolicious.

801
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,880
I got it.

802
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,600
I reached my limit.

803
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,380
Wait, did you spawn in these tanks?

804
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,940
Wait, you can just spawn in propane tanks.

805
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,160
Yeah, you can.

806
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,400
That's what I did.

807
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,020
I literally just spawned in propane tanks.

808
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,620
It's a novelty.

809
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,620
It's not even included in the fireworks.

810
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,000
I can spawn more than I can fireworks.

811
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,600
Yeah, because it's a prop.

812
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,920
I don't know why they add propane tanks in a prop category.

813
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:24,020
I enjoy the fact that we played a fireworks game and it took us less than 30 minutes for us to just put 500 propane tanks If you think about it, propane tank is like a bigger firework.

814
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,660
If you think about it.

815
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,640
We're going for the movie scene.

816
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,740
It's like a firework on the ground.

817
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,120
Alright, are we ready to light it up?

818
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,900
Alright, Mint, give us a sermon.

819
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,900
What the fuck is this?

820
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:51,620
We're gathered here to give thanks to the lord of explosions because we surely do love them.

821
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,600
It's going to be like the fucking kingdom scene right here.

822
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:54,860
Amen!

823
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,620
Can I get a hallelujah?

824
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,070
Hallelujah!

825
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:07,770
Hallelujah!

826
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,090
You don't get to survive this.

827
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,550
Light it up!

828
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,870
I'm stuck behind the mountains.

829
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,490
I ended up on the top of the mountain.

830
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,650
I can see you.

831
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:46,910
Hallelujah!

832
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,710
Hallelujah!

833
00:40:53,490 --> 00:41:00,050
I heard there was a sacred horn that David played and it pleased the lord.

834
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,470
Praise the lord!

835
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:04,850
Praise thee!

836
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,710
Oh my god.

837
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:09,950
What is this?

838
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,610
There's just so much smoke too.

839
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,410
They really encapsulate that smoke that lingers.

840
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,230
I know.

841
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,710
Oh my god.

842
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:23,730
The church is still standing somehow.

843
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,890
The inside is kind of fogged.

844
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:32,710
They didn't add any physics to the front part.

845
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,710
We blew it up so hard the pool next door lost all the water.

846
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,470
Oh my god.

847
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,350
Oh my god.

848
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,270
I like how the fireworks...

849
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,150
Can you hear the objects colliding?

850
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:46,950
No.

851
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:51,050
Oh, I can hear it, yeah.

852
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,890
I'm unlocked.

853
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,350
Wait, you can unlock items.

854
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,310
What'd you unlock?

855
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,050
Wait, there's some level of physics.

856
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,330
If I throw this wood at the church, the pieces of it move.

857
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,570
Oh, not that one though.

858
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,790
Not the windows.

859
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,090
The windows stayed.

860
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,790
Pick up.

861
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,290
That is real.

862
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,570
The windows are still there.

863
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,090
Pick up.

864
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,790
Why can't I pick up?

865
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,110
You press 2.

866
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,830
It's telling me E.

867
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,730
How do I unlock things?

868
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,530
Press 2.

869
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,210
Oh, like...

870
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

871
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,060
Are you okay?

872
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,960
She's being transformed.

873
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,360
Oh my god.

874
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,420
Smoke.

875
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,280
How do I unlock stuff?

876
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,380
You see this dog house?

877
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,280
There's a question mark in there.

878
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:51,580
Oh.

879
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,360
I...

880
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,780
Ninja transformed in the smoke.

881
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,380
Why is it moving?

882
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,900
I just picked it up.

883
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,340
I just decided to throw it.

884
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,100
No unlock for you.

885
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,560
I don't need any of this.

886
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:08,560
Screw it.

887
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,400
There was a question mark in that dog house and I unlocked a new firework.

888
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,720
I got this french fry for you.

889
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,480
Oh, so we gotta go find other fireworks.

890
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,600
Wait, I wanna see if Germantown is still available.

891
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,080
Oh, maybe us exploding buildings is good because maybe there's secrets inside them.

892
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:24,720
Yeah, exactly.

893
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,980
So we should spawn more propainting.

894
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,720
Someone should check if Germantown of 125 mods is free now.

895
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,520
No!

896
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,620
What are we gonna boot?

897
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,180
Are we booting up 125 Germantown mods?

898
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,860
They have 125 mods!

899
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,580
I can't even imagine what kind of mods...

900
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,340
You guys join first just in case half the mods are dicks.

901
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:44,760
Yeah.

902
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,960
I'm the host, I can't leave.

903
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,040
I'm just gonna blow up this house.

904
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,820
Yeah, I was gonna say, I'm just gonna start blowing up the houses.

905
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,180
I wanna see what's in the house.

906
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,540
They didn't let me in.

907
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:57,660
Oh!

908
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,340
What happened?

909
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,160
You good?

910
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,540
Are you okay over there?

911
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,140
What did you use?

912
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,140
What on earth did you do?

913
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,560
What did you do?

914
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,180
Propain.

915
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,140
Where do you find the propain at?

916
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:16,940
Oh, I see it.

917
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,160
Yeah, baby.

918
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,040
Where's the secret fireworks, guys?

919
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,020
What do we need?

920
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:29,880
Secret fireworks.

921
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,600
I was promised secret fireworks.

922
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,660
Here we go.

923
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,420
What are you guys doing?

924
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,520
Let's blow it up.

925
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,620
I reached the limit.

926
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,620
No more?

927
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,440
No more already?

928
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,500
I can't spawn anymore propain?

929
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,000
You gotta light it up.

930
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,340
You have to light it up to get rid of it.

931
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,180
There isn't any.

932
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,920
How is the house still standing?

933
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,000
Other than like maybe a bunch of them just got...

934
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,080
Oh wait, did they get knocked out into the world?

935
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:04,980
Wait, oh my god.

936
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,980
There's just lingering propain.

937
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,040
Oh yeah, maybe half the fireworks you spawned at first are in the mountains now.

938
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,180
I'm gonna clear all the props out.

939
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:13,660
The feds are here.

940
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,500
Oh my god, it's you.

941
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,400
What are you doing, lady?

942
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,420
You committing crime?

943
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:23,880
No.

944
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,700
Are you guys trying to commit some crime?

945
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,820
Excuse me, Mr. Ginger.

946
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,620
No officer, I would never...

947
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,880
No officer.

948
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,300
No officer.

949
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,080
I heard some noise.

950
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,200
I got calls about a noise complaint here, ladies.

951
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:39,640
No.

952
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,080
You happen to be responsible.

953
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,540
What are all of these?

954
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,480
This is my inhaler.

955
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,380
My inhaler.

956
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,800
One non-propane, maybe, to blow it all up.

957
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,980
The disturbance of peace.

958
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:56,920
Let's do the cakes.

959
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,920
What other avatars do they have?

960
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,220
There's an avatar that's literally called City Gamer Girl.

961
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,920
I know, it's so funny.

962
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,140
I think it's like that Twitch...

963
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,700
The Twitch actress.

964
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,680
Twitch Purple.

965
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,700
Yeah, it's the Twitch Purple.

966
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,440
Hey, I gotta get my propane to explode.

967
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,000
Why will it not?

968
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,340
I don't know.

969
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,800
You just light it.

970
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,800
You have to light it up.

971
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,640
You hold it and then you light it up.

972
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,640
Goodbye, gas station.

973
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,980
Oh, I think it worked.

974
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,900
Oh my God.

975
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,300
Oh my God!

976
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,320
I know exactly where you guys are.

977
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,700
There's like...

978
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,220
Sequential, there's just house after house.

979
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:50,420
I took out the gas station.

980
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,220
Why don't my places catch on fire?

981
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,380
I don't know.

982
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,920
We can see what you're doing.

983
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,000
Maybe we gotta see what you're doing wrong.

984
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:04,500
Yeah.

985
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,580
I'm not a good pyromaniac.

986
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,380
Show us your method.

987
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,460
Okay, let's go blow up the grocery store.

988
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,000
Choose your house.

989
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,580
A grocery store?

990
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,700
Yeah, there's a grocery store.

991
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,460
Wait, wait, wait.

992
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,400
Should we restart the map and then specifically put a bunch of propane in the fireworks display?

993
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,840
Because that was big by itself.

994
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,000
So if we then dump...

995
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,660
Everyone puts propane in the fireworks display.

996
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,120
Oh, what is that?

997
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,960
Wait, what?

998
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,340
What is this?

999
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,320
What happened?

1000
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,520
I don't know, I found it on the side.

1001
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,780
This is the mascot for the fireworks store.

1002
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,000
I'm really tiny now, by the way.

1003
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,160
You're so tiny.

1004
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,300
I'll have to restart the server.

1005
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,600
Why are you so small?

1006
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,240
Then we can drop 200 propane tanks in the fireworks place.

1007
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,400
Okay.

1008
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,460
I'm gonna take a whiz break really quick.

1009
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,160
Okay.

1010
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,980
Oh my god, another German server.

1011
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,180
What map was that, Ducky?

1012
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,760
Oh, there's a Norway server now!

1013
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,740
Hell yeah.

1014
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,860
Okay, that was the city town.

1015
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,700
Oh, okay.

1016
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,200
Alright, do we want the same map?

1017
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,120
We want the same map, right?

1018
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,400
I think we specifically want to blow up that damn map.

1019
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1020
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,260
Alright, I'll put 150 fireworks limit now.

1021
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,480
Oh god, 150 each?

1022
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,520
In the fireworks?

1023
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,060
Yeah!

1024
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,820
Yeah!

1025
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:40,340
I like how this was supposed to be a fireworks sim, but instead we just found the propane tanks.

1026
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,260
And we're using them to explode buildings?

1027
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,440
That's much more important.

1028
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,960
I like to sprinkle in some fireworks for show.

1029
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:53,020
Yeah, cause it has a nice little halo above it as you blow up a building.

1030
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,960
Yeah, it's like a big...

1031
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,520
Alright, let's see...

1032
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,520
It's king of the hill sim.

1033
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,880
Alright, where is it?

1034
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,220
Where's the place?

1035
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,080
It was where the smoldering fireball was earlier, so it's over this way.

1036
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:10,840
Oh, you sent a new one.

1037
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,440
I think it's over this way.

1039
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,160
Sorry guys, I'm now looking.

1040
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,140
Also, you're... Wait, there's a server called Doki and Mint Kissing.

1041
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,880
Ok, I did not...

1042
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,580
That's actually a new server, cause I nearly did not see that server in my list.

1043
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,380
Alright.

1044
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,000
Ok, I'm back.

1045
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,300
I am propaining.

1046
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:44,960
Dang it.

1047
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,080
I hope I didn't miss anything.

1048
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,380
No, you're good, you're good.

1049
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,240
Yeah, put the server code.

1050
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,420
Wait, where is the fireworks store?

1051
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,660
You guys blew it up before I could see what it looked like.

1052
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,700
Wait, it's not...

1053
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,600
Do you remember where the smoldering fireball was the first time Snuffy blew something up?

1054
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,060
It's there.

1055
00:49:59,120 --> 00:49:59,980
Oh, I found it.

1056
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,480
Yeah, oh, Cody's fireworks.

1057
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,420
Wait, that side was...

1058
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,520
That was the sign that's on the house.

1059
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,020
Yeah.

1060
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,280
I thought it was like a welcome board on the ground.

1061
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,740
I feel like if we all do this, we might actually crush the server and it's gonna be glorious.

1062
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,520
Yeah, crush the server!

1063
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,100
I'm gonna fall over and die.

1064
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,000
I got the red propane.

1065
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,220
Also, the red looks like it's scarier.

1066
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,180
Oh my god.

1067
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,900
Oh my god, I just saw like a tiny, tiny Snuffy running through the...

1068
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,880
I like how it says props, but it's...

1069
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,120
Who left this child here?

1070
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,740
I'll do some rockets.

1071
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,780
This is what you get for being on the naughty list.

1072
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,320
Let me make it a little bit patriotic as well.

1073
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,420
Oh my god, it's so...

1074
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:51,980
Wait, we should...

1075
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,480
Guys, we have 150 props and 150 fireworks, so you can add more fireworks later.

1076
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,560
Make sure when you specifically light the propane tanks, because when I lit a firework near the propane tank, it didn't work.

1077
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,520
Yeah, you have to light the propane tank itself.

1078
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,120
Yeah, propane tank itself.

1079
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,560
We should save this too, and then if we want to spawn...

1080
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,820
I can barely walk, there's so many propane tanks.

1081
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,980
You need to spawn in it instead.

1082
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,000
This is like we're filling up a fish enclosure.

1083
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,760
We're just like the pebbles.

1084
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,680
Viper, viper.

1085
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,180
I haven't reached the limit yet.

1086
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:24,880
Me neither.

1087
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,500
Propane tank yet.

1088
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,240
You know what, I'm just gonna spam, spam, spam...

1089
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,800
Spam, spam, spam...

1090
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,460
Oh, slow tank.

1091
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,540
Yeah, I got the slow tank.

1092
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,480
Wait, wait, wait.

1093
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,940
But now I can fill it up.

1094
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,080
Now I can fill it up with fireworks.

1095
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:38,500
There's still 50.

1096
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,960
Wait, why is there just this one corner with nothing in it?

1097
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,320
Yeah, there's this one corner with nothing.

1098
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,660
Oh, here, I'll come get it.

1099
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,300
We got this area filled with fireworks.

1100
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:49,960
Fill it up, fill it up.

1101
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,840
We got strobolicious.

1102
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,820
Strobolicious fireworks.

1103
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,680
I can still spawn in propane.

1104
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,400
Guys, this is...

1105
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,680
Oh, propane and fireworks are separate, so...

1106
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,840
Yeah, you need 50 fireworks and 150 props, dude.

1107
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,900
We're layering this like a sandwich.

1108
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,620
Oh, I've reached the limit, I've reached the limit.

1109
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,640
I'm in the corner.

1110
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:08,880
Okay.

1111
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,300
Oh my God, I can't even go through this area anymore.

1112
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,320
I'm stuck.

1113
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,700
Do we wanna be inside or do we wanna be outside?

1114
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,460
Do we want someone to have the outside perspective?

1115
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:20,760
Okay, I call...

1116
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,920
For the sake of my PC, I'm gonna be outside.

1117
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:24,540
Okay.

1118
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,860
But you're not even streaming.

1119
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,580
Chat, which do you want?

1120
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,460
Oh, wait, you're outside perspective.

1121
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,700
Do you wanna be inside or outside, chat?

1122
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,440
Which do you want?

1123
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,060
I'll be outside because I was already inside for this explosion one time.

1124
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,480
Okay, I'll stay inside then.

1125
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,060
I'll sit on this lovely chair and you guys go ahead and just...

1126
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,380
I see a lot of outsides, okay.

1127
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,340
I found a fairly isolated propane tank.

1128
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,460
Do you want me to light this one?

1129
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,400
Yeah.

1130
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,520
Okay.

1131
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,360
Okay, we ready?

1132
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,500
No, no, wait, I'm adding a little bit.

1133
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,080
I'm adding Thick Billy in here.

1134
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,660
Okay.

1135
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,300
Who is that?

1136
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,100
Who is this?

1137
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,260
What is this?

1138
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,060
You can add a person?

1139
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,300
No, no, it's a name of a fire.

1140
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,960
Oh my god, we can just add a man in the middle.

1141
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,640
Wait, we can put the snowman.

1142
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,760
We can put the snowman.

1143
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,260
And then one Christmas tree.

1144
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,780
I'm stuck, I'm stuck again.

1145
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,860
One flamingo.

1146
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,320
Do not barricade yourselves in.

1147
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,620
Are you ready?

1148
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,080
I need to clean this up a little bit.

1149
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,920
Oh my god, I'm lagging already.

1150
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,180
I think being inside is pretty epic.

1151
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:42,900
It's... okay.

1152
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,520
If I can get inside...

1153
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,360
Mint, you can blow up with me if you want.

1154
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,740
Alright, I'll light one too.

1155
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,680
Let me know when you're ready.

1156
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,080
Alright, I'm ready.

1157
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,800
Who will stay inside?

1158
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,300
It's been nice knowing you all.

1159
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,220
Why do you have a stopwatch with you?

1160
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,620
It's a countdown timer.

1161
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,540
Alright, let's hope this works.

1162
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,140
I'm going to light this thing now.

1163
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,020
Godspeed everybody.

1164
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,020
Here we go!

1165
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,040
Oh my god!

1166
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:28,780
It's so beautiful!

1167
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:37,820
Oh my god!

1168
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,240
The second wing!

1169
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,100
The second wing!

1170
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,680
The second wing!

1171
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,080
Oh my god!

1172
00:54:53,320 --> 00:55:00,800
I like how half of them went off on the corner of town because all the fireworks got blown the fuck out there.

1173
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,480
Don't worry, there's still more.

1174
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,320
There's still more!

1175
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,700
The slowdown!

1176
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,420
There was like a slowdown.

1177
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,420
They all started coming at me like an action movie.

1178
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,480
It was so awesome.

1179
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,400
I'm going to be sick.

1180
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,360
Merry Christmas everybody!

1181
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,620
Where did everybody end up?

1182
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,800
There are a lot of buildings on fire.

1183
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,980
I think it's over.

1184
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,880
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

1185
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,660
I think it's over.

1186
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,340
It's so smoky.

1187
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,440
I can't even see.

1188
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,620
Honestly, the game handled that pretty well.

1189
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,980
I think I did pretty well.

1190
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:09,680
What the fuck?

1191
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,840
I heard a noise.

1192
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,160
I heard there was a disturbance in the area.

1193
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,880
Come and see what I found.

1194
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,720
Wait, where are you?

1195
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,500
I'm behind the fireworks store.

1196
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:28,420
Half the propane tanks seem to merge into a gigantic caterpillar.

1197
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,260
Do you see it here?

1198
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,460
No, I don't see it.

1199
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,220
It's a giant propane caterpillar!

1200
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,120
I see your snowman.

1201
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,380
Let me take a screenshot.

1202
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,660
Shall I see if they're still real?

1203
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,640
I could blow them up.

1204
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1205
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,000
What the fuck?

1206
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:47,600
What?

1207
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,280
Are they real?

1208
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:52,640
I don't think they're real.

1209
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,400
Oh my god!

1210
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,500
It looks like a big...

1211
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,760
That's long.

1212
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,440
No, they're not real.

1213
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,840
Can I pick one up?

1214
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,980
No, I can't even pick one up.

1215
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,520
They're not real.

1216
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,760
Let me show you guys.

1217
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,300
Wait, I mean...

1218
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,560
I have Limoon chat, so you guys can probably see it.

1219
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,540
But in case you can't, this is Limoon's.

1220
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,060
Hey look, the snowman survived, guys.

1221
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,360
Where did the Christmas tree go?

1222
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,160
Where did the snowman...

1223
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,400
Oh, it's over there.

1224
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,040
I see it.

1225
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,220
It's all the way over there.

1226
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,160
Where are you?

1227
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,300
I'm where we were...

1228
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,980
Where we found the centipede.

1229
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,500
I was just there.

1230
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,040
There's a Christmas tree right there.

1231
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,740
Yes, see it?

1232
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,200
Oh no, I think maybe the objects have all gotten fucked up.

1233
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:35,940
I think so too.

1234
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,940
Because I'm like...

1235
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,600
I don't see anything.

1236
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,100
Sorry guys, I didn't take my meds today.

1237
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:42,580
Sorry.

1238
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,140
Don't take my meds.

1239
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,740
Everywhere I look, I see the Christmas tree.

1240
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,160
It's like it follows, but...

1241
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,680
It's a Christmas tree.

1242
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,460
Wait, I found another hidden thing.

1243
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,420
If we want to get it.

1244
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,560
Another unlockable.

1245
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,600
Oh, yes please.

1246
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,760
It's at the tree house.

1247
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,200
You know where the tree house is?

1248
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,160
Yeah, I'm at the tree house.

1249
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,040
No, you're not.

1250
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,900
You're running on a fence.

1251
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,500
We're at a tree house right here.

1252
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,140
Definitely not real.

1253
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,920
There must be multiple tree houses.

1254
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,800
No, I see it.

1255
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,960
I don't see any of you at the tree house.

1256
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,760
What the fuck?

1257
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,260
We're not at the tree house.

1258
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,040
We're at Doki running on a fence.

1259
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,340
Doki is like lagging out.

1260
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,140
I think we actually did break the server.

1261
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,880
She's got the burden on her shoulders.

1262
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,080
She's like, I'm at the tree house.

1263
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:41,720
Wait, wait, you guys.

1264
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,580
It's like I died and I'm a ghost right now.

1265
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,840
You have to open up some of the stream.

1266
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,460
Because you're literally... you won't move.

1267
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,540
You're just running in place on a fence right now.

1268
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,180
I'm like a ghost right now.

1269
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,020
Is it just me or does this cop avatar have a really bad case of lordosis?

1270
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,700
What is lordosis?

1271
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,380
It's where his back is curved and then his ass is sticking out.

1272
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,660
He's dead, bro.

1273
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,420
He's got that curve-alicious.

1274
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,460
I'm a ghost looking at what happened to what my life was gonna be like after I died.

1275
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,300
Why are you so small, Mint?

1276
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,800
Why are you both so small?

1277
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:18,700
There's a baby.

1278
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,500
We're the baby version.

1279
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,820
Yeah, yeah, be the girl and boy rather than woman and man.

1280
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,360
There you go.

1281
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:33,020
You're so freaking scary and I'm dating you.

1282
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:36,520
You're so fucked up.

1283
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,180
Am I a gingerbread man at least?

1284
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,800
Yeah, you're a gingerbread man.

1285
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,880
But I'm still running in place.

1286
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,820
Stop spawning this Christmas tree.

1287
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,760
This Christmas tree has a dick now.

1288
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,680
How do we get into the treehouse?

1289
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,960
I don't know how.

1290
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,140
It's really high up.

1291
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,600
What if we just blow it up?

1292
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,520
Okay, let's do it.

1293
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,960
It's the only thing we know how to do.

1294
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,840
Wait, guys, I think we can parkour it.

1295
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,720
You wanna parkour?

1296
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,980
Instead of just exploding it?

1297
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,900
Where's your sense of adventure?

1298
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,240
Where's your sense of adventure?

1299
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,220
Parkouring is more adventurous than blowing something up.

1300
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,180
What do you mean?

1301
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,440
They're presents under the Christmas tree.

1302
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,400
You are being very strategic about this.

1303
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:25,260
I appreciate that.

1304
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,300
There, look, see?

1305
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,200
Parkour.

1306
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,840
They're presents under the Christmas tree.

1307
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,680
I'll add some presents.

1308
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,400
Yeah, because your game is glitched.

1309
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,560
You're not here.

1310
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,360
I'm trying to fix her.

1311
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,740
Insert them into the tree a little bit.

1312
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,160
This is the tree of life and propane.

1313
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,420
Oh, great propane tree.

1314
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,160
Wait, wait.

1315
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,440
I'm gonna add some...

1316
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,300
You can parkour up using propane tanks.

1317
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,320
No way!

1318
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,600
I think so.

1319
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,760
Oh my god, you're doing it!

1320
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,960
We need to strategically place them.

1321
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,240
Or we can still blow it up.

1322
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,220
We could still blow it up.

1323
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,200
Let's just blow it up.

1324
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,800
I liked your strategy, Limu, but...

1325
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,800
Wait, there's one called Amazing Granny.

1326
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,300
Wait, wait, wait.

1327
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,300
It's literally Matara.

1328
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,500
Except the amazing part.

1329
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,080
Guys, you know we can spawn in a little box, guys?

1330
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,440
Like, we could...

1331
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:29,340
I love that Doki can just spawn stuff in, but I can't even see her, so she's just like literal God being like...

1332
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:30,420
A box for you, Matara.

1333
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,780
I've given my kids a box.

1334
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:45,450
What happened?

1335
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:47,270
I just got sent to space.

1336
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:51,450
It looks like the tree is explosion-proof, maybe?

1337
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,710
I can't fucking see, it's so smoky in here.

1338
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:54,290
I can't see, it's so smoky.

1339
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:56,850
Guys, I got it!

1340
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:57,430
Oh no.

1341
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,390
Oh wait, your box has survived.

1342
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:02,430
I told you.

1343
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,270
I told you the box strat works.

1344
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,710
Are you transform-icing this right now?

1345
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,210
Doki's our shaman, let's go.

1346
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:10,930
How did you get in?

1347
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,330
I just parkoured.

1348
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:15,050
Jesus Christ, you are so good at this game.

1349
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:17,430
Okay, it's only a smoke bomb yellow.

1350
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:24,150
I get bounced off of the branch to the left.

1351
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:25,190
When I try.

1352
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:27,750
Yeah, I get bounced off.

1353
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,290
I can freeze it.

1354
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:32,830
When you get up there, you have to crouch to walk in.

1355
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:34,450
I can freeze the box.

1356
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:36,510
Wait, wait, wait.

1357
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,690
I can give you an elevator.

1358
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:39,630
Stand on the box.

1359
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,350
Stand on top of one of the boxes.

1360
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:44,110
I'm on one.

1361
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:49,170
You're not, you're floating for me.

1362
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,450
Where are you?

1363
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,130
Are you still on the...

1364
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:55,110
You're floating on... oh, there, there, there.

1365
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,530
Did you use the elevator?

1366
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,370
Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1367
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:01,290
Doki's acting like she's one of the team.

1368
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,450
Santa's not real.

1369
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,230
There's no Santa here.

1370
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,750
Bro thinks he's part of the team.

1371
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:24,550
Are you still here?

1372
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:27,090
Can we blow you up, maybe?

1373
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,150
Let's try blowing you up.

1374
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:31,030
I think she makes this fence invincible.

1375
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:34,210
Because I couldn't blow it up when she was here.

1376
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:36,850
Maybe you're just not trying hard enough.

1377
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:37,910
Merry Christmas!

1378
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,950
Merry freaking Christmas, Santa Claus.

1379
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,470
Merry freaking Christmas.

1380
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:46,390
God, it's like a wonderful life.

1381
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,430
Guys, please, I'm alive!

1382
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,630
This will free her.

1383
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:52,910
You'll be free after this.

1384
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:55,470
I can't pick a single thing to...

1385
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,630
Goodbye, cruel world.

1386
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:04,590
I don't know about you guys, but my cramping tanks are now like spawning.

1387
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,990
They're fixed in position.

1388
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:08,970
They no longer have physics, they just kind of spawn in the air.

1389
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:09,730
Oh yeah, mine too.

1390
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,350
I think the server's way broken.

1391
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:14,530
She's still there.

1392
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,890
Should we try a different town then?

1393
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,990
Yeah, Donkey, you're stuck.

1394
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:28,370
Different map.

1395
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:32,250
We can be a whole different town.

1396
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:33,370
Exciting.

1397
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,650
New things to blow up.

1398
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:37,670
New fireworks stars to find.

1399
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:42,950
Oh my god, wait, there's so many new mods.

1400
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:47,610
Okay, don't join the 195 mod team.

1401
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:53,010
Did you guys ever have a pyromania phase?

1402
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:57,230
I heard that's very popular for people to go through a phase when you're growing up.

1403
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,850
Is that you become like a pyromaniac for a little bit.

1404
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:01,250
What?

1405
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,810
Okay, tell us your story.

1406
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:05,050
What?

1407
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,870
Is that not a thing?

1408
01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:10,230
I don't think that's a phase, right?

1409
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:16,590
I swear, it's a phase that you're like, yeah.

1410
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:23,350
We can set up a roleplay server and have money so somebody can buy fireworks.

1411
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:25,490
How do you do that?

1412
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:27,650
It's in the workshop.

1413
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,950
I'm downloading mods.

1414
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,330
Oh, we're getting mods?

1415
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:31,130
Oh my god.

1416
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,130
Yeah, we're getting mods.

1417
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,650
I got the Xmas mod.

1418
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,590
There's a German village.

1419
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:38,790
Do we have to subscribe too?

1420
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,110
Presumably not.

1421
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:45,710
Yeah, I think we can just download them as we go in like a Garry's Mod server or something.

1422
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:48,790
Christmas characters, do the Christmas characters.

1423
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:50,630
Okay, yeah, I did it.

1424
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:51,630
There's Olaf in there.

1425
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:54,290
And the creepy gnome.

1426
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:58,310
Okay, I added something.

1427
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:01,550
I added a mod in there.

1428
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,530
This looks so fun.

1429
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,730
Oh, there's the ski resort.

1430
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,310
Wait, there's a Minecraft mod?

1431
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:11,890
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.

1432
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:12,830
Yeah, I added it.

1433
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:13,970
I subscribed to it.

1434
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,830
There's a lot of shit in here.

1435
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,990
Fireworks store props, oh no.

1436
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,710
There's literally 65.

1437
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:24,810
I'm not gonna look through 65 pages.

1438
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:25,890
That's way too many.

1439
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,950
Wait, wait, there's like pop by popular.

1440
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,870
I'm gonna get the update popularity.

1441
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,670
What is the most popular one?

1442
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,230
That's what I was looking at.

1443
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:42,570
Doki, apparently there's an iconic character pack and you can be Shrek.

1444
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:45,590
That was the one I literally subscribed to.

1445
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:46,010
I was like...

1446
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:49,470
Hell yeah, hell yeah.

1447
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:55,910
People are making like actual fireworks and not like memes and stuff.

1448
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:56,610
It's kind of impressive.

1449
01:06:56,610 --> 01:07:00,050
I've downloaded maybe five different nuke mods.

1450
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:07,070
I'm just gonna let you guys pick whatever.

1451
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,250
Okay, I got it.

1452
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:12,370
I even added real... I added money into the mod too.

1453
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,410
Wait, so we're gonna have to pay for stuff?

1454
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,290
Yeah, I'll be the clerk.

1455
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,970
Welcome to capitalism.

1456
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:21,610
I'm gonna reproduce capitalism into this game.

1457
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:25,610
Wait, can you get the realistic nuke mod?

1458
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,190
Oh, there's a Wild West one too.

1459
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:31,770
How cute.

1460
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,730
I got something really funny.

1461
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:39,850
Okay, let me get the code.

1462
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:41,710
Boo.

1463
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,370
What the fuck?

1464
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,250
There's a statue of Liberty here.

1465
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:51,350
I'm joining.

1466
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:53,730
It's like low FPS?

1467
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:56,570
Yeah, but I don't think lowering the quality is gonna help.

1468
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:58,910
I think it's just that we fucking nuked this area.

1469
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:02,470
Yeah, we're trying to blow this game up, literally.

1470
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:06,170
It's about blowing things up, but we're trying to push this limit.

1471
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:09,370
We're just a bunch of girls, you know.

1472
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:12,950
We just can't help ourselves with spawning in 500 per minute.

1473
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,650
The feminine urge to spawn in 200 per minute.

1474
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,030
Loading Minecraft mod map.

1475
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:20,670
Let's go!

1476
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:21,390
Loading mods!

1477
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:23,790
Oh, look at all the mods loading!

1478
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,890
What have I got here?

1479
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:27,810
What have I got here?

1480
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:28,830
Oh my god!

1481
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:33,450
Scooby Doo!

1482
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:33,970
Gross!

1483
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,730
Oh my god, it's Benjamin Babbitt!

1484
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,650
He's here!

1485
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:41,110
I heard you guys were a fan.

1486
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,890
Wow, there's so many!

1487
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:45,350
Oh my god, I'm Olaf.

1488
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:49,150
Look at the statue of Liberty!

1489
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:52,190
There's literally a fucking statue of Liberty!

1490
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:56,490
Ew, why does Scooby look like that?

1491
01:08:56,490 --> 01:09:03,590
Why is there a statue of Liberty?

1492
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:06,810
Why is there a statue of Liberty?

1493
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,670
Oh my god!

1494
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,970
Wait, I'm not seeing them.

1495
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:14,790
Oh, I see them now.

1496
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:15,490
They're like...

1497
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,230
Oh shit, it's Otto!

1498
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:24,510
Oh my god!

1499
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:26,810
Guys, we're in GTA, guys!

1500
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:31,730
Oh shit, here we go again!

1501
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:35,630
Oh my god, I wish there was emote dances and stuff.

1502
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:39,610
There probably is like 195 plus monsters.

1503
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,410
Oh god, why is the Shrek so textured?

1504
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,730
I'm moving really slowly as well.

1505
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:46,410
Holy shit.

1506
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:47,890
Oh my god!

1507
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,010
Oh my god, I can do it!

1508
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:49,710
I'm stomping!

1509
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:51,070
Oh my god!

1510
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,090
Why is it raining money?

1511
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:54,850
Why is it raining money?

1512
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:55,890
It's for me!

1513
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:04,670
I told you the money was like...

1514
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:05,890
I just bought a bunch of dollars.

1515
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:08,270
Oh my god, there's 500 euros!

1516
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:09,810
I got the big bucks, yeah!

1517
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,410
500 euros, baby!

1518
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:16,030
I'm picking it all up.

1519
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:19,890
Eat it on the floor, eat it on the floor.

1520
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:21,610
And lick it up.

1521
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:23,090
Lick it up!

1522
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:26,470
Wait, can you guys tell which one is the real one?

1523
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:27,630
Can you guys tell?

1524
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:30,590
Yeah, the one with the...

1525
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:31,830
Yeah, that one's Herobrine.

1526
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:35,630
That one's literally Herobrine, isn't it?

1527
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,450
Unless that's the pupils.

1528
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:39,190
Yeah, it's just guys...

1529
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:40,650
Oh yeah, it's just brown eyes.

1530
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,950
Wow.

1531
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,330
I'm gonna blow up Minecraft.

1532
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:48,950
Oh my god, you're gonna blow up Minecraft?

1533
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:49,950
You're gonna be a creeper.

1534
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:51,130
Wait, where's the creeper?

1535
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,230
Wait, do you think we could be creepers?

1536
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:56,530
Oh, I have to go back and pick this.

1537
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:00,710
I'm going to go through a bunch of propane at the base of the Statue of Liberty.

1538
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,270
Yeah, I was about to literally...

1539
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,170
Wow, that was beautiful.

1540
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:09,190
That was beautiful.

1541
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:11,750
Now make 50 more of them.

1542
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:12,730
It looks very well structured.

1543
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:13,570
Is it gonna work?

1544
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,550
It'll work.

1545
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:15,430
It'll work.

1546
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:16,730
I'm inside.

1547
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:17,210
Oh god.

1548
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,790
This is too much like Minecraft.

1549
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,750
I'm stuck in the...

1550
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,030
I cannot get up these steps with Shrek.

1551
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:25,390
I'm stuck in the Minecraft.

1552
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:26,690
Oh no.

1553
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:29,010
Where are you?

1554
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,290
Because I'm stuck in the Minecraft.

1555
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:31,930
Oh there we go.

1556
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:36,730
Are you guys gonna blow up the Statue of Liberty?

1557
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:37,130
Yeah.

1558
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,090
Here we are.

1559
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:42,550
Sounds like a Nicolas Cage problem.

1560
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,610
The Declaration of Independence.

1561
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,650
We're gonna steal it to stop them from stealing it.

1562
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:51,370
Oh gosh, getting up these steps.

1563
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,330
They're not automatic.

1564
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:53,050
Oh my god.

1565
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,910
No, I was like jumping them.

1566
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:55,970
I was striking, it was awful.

1567
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,170
Serious, my worst enemy.

1568
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:01,630
Alright, time to put them all at the base.

1569
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:04,130
Well, it goes all the way up, Mint.

1570
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:06,930
I don't know if you wanna put them like in this room here.

1571
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:08,690
I don't feel like you can blow...

1572
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:12,570
I think it's aesthetic so you can see the fireworks next to the Statue of Liberty.

1573
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:16,130
Yeah, I'm not sure this is going to explode and that makes me very sad.

1574
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:17,850
Wait, how do you...

1575
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,850
Oh, there's stairs out here.

1576
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,150
Oh my god, there's more stairs?

1577
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:22,910
Yeah.

1578
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:29,390
Oh my god.

1579
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:35,190
This game feels cathartic, honestly.

1580
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:37,670
This is so nice.

1581
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:40,210
This is like axe throwing but for my brain.

1582
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,630
Do any of the...

1583
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:46,950
Oh, we got Christmas lights now.

1584
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:47,470
That's cute.

1585
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:48,930
I love the names of fireworks.

1586
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:50,610
Do any of the Minecraft buildings blow up?

1587
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:53,510
Wait, this map is so big.

1588
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:55,810
There's more behind the village.

1589
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:56,570
Oh, hello.

1590
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:59,630
There's more stuff behind the village, guys.

1591
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:00,590
This is actually crazy.

1592
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:01,250
Is this as far as it goes?

1593
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,390
Like towards the...

1594
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:06,290
Yeah, if you go behind...

1595
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:09,290
If you go like the opposite side from the Statue of Liberty...

1596
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,570
There's like an entire like...

1597
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:12,170
Terrain up here.

1598
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:14,610
Let's just try, Lime.

1599
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:15,450
All we can do.

1600
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:17,190
I'm spreading propane tanks.

1601
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:24,210
Wait, where are you guys?

1602
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:26,630
How long do I just keep running and like...

1603
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:29,170
Getting lost in Minecraft...

1604
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,430
Before I find you guys.

1605
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:33,470
Yeah, go to the Statue of Liberty.

1606
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:37,190
Oh my god, I was going the opposite way.

1607
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:40,030
I like how we said...

1608
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:42,030
We're gonna blow up the Statue of Liberty and you're like...

1609
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,310
I wonder where they could be.

1610
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:44,590
You guys are a genius.

1611
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,870
Oh, we can use the boxes to go up.

1612
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:48,270
Oh.

1613
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:51,850
Yeah.

1614
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:54,990
I'm going to rock the foundations though.

1615
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:55,770
I'm building.

1616
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:59,090
I don't expect it to work.

1617
01:13:59,550 --> 01:13:59,910
Yeah.

1618
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:01,490
I don't expect it to work.

1619
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:04,890
I feel like...

1620
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:05,970
It's very...

1621
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:08,850
We all know in Minecraft...

1622
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:10,590
The structures are very...

1623
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:11,610
Strong in Minecraft.

1624
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:14,870
I'm trying to...

1625
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,970
I'm trying to do this.

1626
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:19,410
It's like all made out of bedrock or some shit.

1627
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:20,090
Don't mind me.

1628
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:21,550
I'm trying to build.

1629
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:24,130
Don't mind me.

1630
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:25,890
Don't mind me.

1631
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:29,450
I like how there's just a trail of propane tanks.

1632
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:34,790
Follow the trail of propane tanks, guys.

1633
01:14:35,330 --> 01:14:35,850
Follow the trail.

1634
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:37,950
All the arsonists are here, are they?

1635
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:39,910
I'm going to use the bathroom while...

1636
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:42,290
I know you guys are going to take a while putting all these propane tanks.

1637
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:43,230
I'm going to use the bathroom.

1638
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:45,090
This is going to be the greatest...

1639
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,510
The greatest heist ever known to man.

1640
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:50,590
Which is the biggest firework?

1641
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:50,970
OK.

1642
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:52,690
I made it to the base.

1643
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,710
It looks like a bunch of corn dogs.

1644
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:01,850
Oh my god.

1645
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:03,770
I don't have a nuke.

1646
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,110
I literally don't have one called nuke.

1647
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,750
Wait, where is hyper-realistic nuke?

1648
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,670
I downloaded like five of those mods.

1649
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:13,130
Oh, I think maybe because Doki...

1650
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:16,010
Doki didn't download a singular bomb?

1651
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,070
Wow.

1652
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:19,110
There's now a box called fuck you.

1653
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,730
What?

1654
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,490
I'm going to put fuck you in here.

1655
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,130
Where do you see that?

1656
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:26,790
It's under...

1657
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:28,450
Cakes?

1658
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:29,250
Yeah, it's under cakes.

1659
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:29,970
Cakes.

1660
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:32,550
Oh wow, look at these.

1661
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,710
Wow, bloody Mary.

1662
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,150
Painted sky.

1663
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:38,970
Like the smooth criminals.

1664
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:40,870
This one's called wrap.

1665
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,570
Oh, it's so tiny.

1666
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,910
Yeah, fuck you's kinda small.

1667
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,870
Sam's gone.

1668
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:51,210
This one's called gladiator 60 italian style.

1669
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:52,430
This one's got bears on it.

1670
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:53,590
Oh, it's really small too.

1671
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:56,350
Donder slag.

1672
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:57,350
What?

1673
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:59,970
I like donder slag.

1674
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:01,910
Donder slag extra.

1675
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:04,650
This is why all the German people play it.

1676
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:05,950
Yeah.

1677
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:08,870
Maybe they have a lot of fireworks.

1678
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:10,730
We're adding all the fireworks in.

1679
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:12,890
My framerate is already suffering.

1680
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:13,770
I know, me too.

1681
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,630
Funky honey badger.

1682
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:18,010
Funky honey badger.

1683
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:19,250
Honey badger.

1684
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,510
I'm going to add some more propane tanks.

1685
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,550
Actually, I'll do 2024, even though it's almost 2025.

1686
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,390
Happy 2024, everybody.

1687
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:28,130
Oh yeah.

1688
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:30,610
Happy new year.

1689
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:35,150
I like how the italian style firework just looks like a cigar that you spawn.

1690
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:43,430
I'm going to add a world stopper because it sounds intense.

1691
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:44,490
Monster?

1692
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:46,390
Yeah, I've been spawning a bunch of those.

1693
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,150
What is that?

1694
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:49,890
What about this one?

1695
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:51,030
This one's called sphinx.

1696
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,150
Yeah, sphinx looks pretty cool.

1697
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,810
It's a fountain though, so I don't think it'll blow up.

1698
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:58,130
It'll just swoosh a little bit.

1699
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:01,430
It's okay, I'll add more tanks.

1700
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:03,190
I'll do some tall sphinx.

1701
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:03,830
This one's called NATO.

1702
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:04,810
I'm spawning it.

1703
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:09,110
Yeah.

1704
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,970
Yeah.

1705
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:11,990
More.

1706
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:15,090
Limelicious currently has 100 spawned fireworks in the game.

1707
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:17,050
Stop fucking... you snitch.

1708
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:19,430
Calling you out.

1709
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:23,730
I'm down to 40 frames if I accidentally nudge a physics object.

1710
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:31,350
There's like so many tiny objects and stuff he has put in the air that I'm colliding with every single one of them.

1711
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,910
Those are the fireworks.

1712
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,650
Did you just put them down?

1713
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:43,590
So what if I put down 500 different iterations of Gladiator 60 Italian style cigar?

1714
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:46,730
I'm letting propane fall from the heavens too.

1715
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:51,510
I have noticed a few things have come down and almost hit me on the head.

1716
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:52,130
Oh, sorry.

1717
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,750
That's me.

1718
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:53,470
Okay.

1719
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:56,030
Alright, I hit my limit.

1720
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:58,050
I have not yet hit my limit.

1721
01:17:58,150 --> 01:17:59,710
When Stokey's back we can do it.

1722
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:02,490
Oh, this one's called Strobilicious.

1723
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:05,390
I feel like I'm contractually obliged to actually spawn that one.

1724
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:07,310
Strobilicious for Mimelicious.

1725
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:08,450
Hell yeah.

1726
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:11,410
Wait, the map is so big and beautiful from up here.

1727
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,130
Like a voluptuous woman.

1728
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,230
Now light her up.

1729
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:17,890
Love those.

1730
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:19,590
Give her the lighter.

1731
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:22,850
I think we're waiting for Doki.

1732
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,230
Yeah, wait for Doki.

1733
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:26,030
A big reveal.

1734
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:29,590
I don't think the statue is going to blow up.

1735
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:39,350
I feel like I should sit like a movie with an unlit cigarette in my mouth but I'm standing just close enough to the explosion that it will light it just by the sparks flying.

1736
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:41,150
Yeah.

1737
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:41,970
So badass.

1738
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:43,790
What is this material?

1739
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:45,190
I think it's wool.

1740
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:48,690
Why would you make the Statue of Liberty out of wool and not diamonds?

1741
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,330
Because she's soft on the outside.

1742
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,650
Oh my god.

1743
01:18:57,930 --> 01:18:58,870
She's soft.

1744
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:00,270
See, I told you.

1745
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:02,770
She's a beautiful woman.

1746
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:10,310
She's made of copper which is a very...

1747
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,350
It's not as beautiful.

1748
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:14,330
You okay?

1749
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:14,990
I'm okay.

1750
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:20,270
Doki, I want to light these fireworks now.

1751
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:21,530
Yeah, Doki, hurry up.

1752
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,170
Doki!

1753
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:26,290
The pyromaniacs are suffering!

1754
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:30,770
There's hundreds of explosives rigged up to blow and I have to stand here.

1755
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:31,190
Lime, do you see me?

1756
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:32,890
Yes, I see you.

1757
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,810
Are you up on the top up there?

1758
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:35,530
Yeah.

1759
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:38,670
I'm up here.

1760
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:41,850
I've got the zoom out.

1761
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:42,870
The zoom out?

1762
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:43,770
Wait, what do you mean?

1763
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:46,730
I want to see it.

1764
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:47,830
Oh, I see you!

1765
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:48,650
Oh, I see you!

1766
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:53,270
Let me become the bigger...

1767
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,330
Oh, I'm Olaf.

1768
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:58,170
I'm like Olaf with his mouth just like...

1769
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:58,950
gaping open.

1770
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:02,050
That's kind of terrifying.

1771
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,970
Seeing you in the middle of the forest like that.

1772
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:05,570
Scooby's nose.

1773
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,390
I hate that.

1774
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:08,510
It's so scary.

1775
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:16,210
Can you imagine it's dark at night and you look across the field and that's just fucking scary?

1776
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:18,230
I have a picture like that.

1777
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:27,310
In Akiba, there's like this one little alleyway and there's a Olaf, like full-size Olaf costume that has been there for years.

1778
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,330
This is so terrifying.

1779
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:31,810
I have a picture.

1780
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:33,710
Oh, God.

1781
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,230
Not the two...

1782
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:38,710
like the old and overly loved...

1783
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:38,710
Yeah!

1784
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:39,930
Let's explode it!

1785
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:40,630
Blow it up!

1786
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,610
We're gonna blow it up!

1787
01:20:42,610 --> 01:20:44,410
We're gonna blow it up!

1788
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:46,610
I'm still inside the building.

1789
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:49,070
Light it up!

1790
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:50,370
Here we go!

1791
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:53,950
Goodbye, Statue of Liberty!

1792
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:57,990
What?

1793
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:02,590
Oh, no!

1794
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:15,390
I blew up the map.

1795
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,470
I'm in the void.

1796
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:17,390
No!

1797
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:26,620
And our flag was still there.

1798
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:33,870
She's indestructible, everybody!

1799
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:33,990
I'm tiny!

1800
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,970
This is what I saw.

1801
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:42,810
Where are you in the void?

1802
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:45,710
I have no perspective anymore.

1803
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:47,510
I've fallen so far I can't see the map.

1804
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:48,630
I'm still falling.

1805
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:51,050
Look at the chat, guys.

1806
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:56,050
How did you guys get tiny?

1807
01:21:57,190 --> 01:21:58,410
Look at the chat.

1808
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,550
This is what I saw.

1809
01:21:59,550 --> 01:21:59,950
Tiny!

1810
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:02,750
Let me see.

1811
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:07,730
It's beautiful.

1812
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,190
It's kind of poetic, honestly.

1813
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:14,410
Just love watching it all burn.

1814
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:18,870
He's tired.

1815
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:20,830
No more winter.

1816
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:25,730
Is there an unstuck button?

1817
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:26,650
I don't think there is.

1818
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:27,910
I don't think I'm going to do it today.

1819
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,550
I'm coming to get you, Lime!

1820
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:32,470
Yeah, let's rescue Lime!

1821
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,550
Fireworks for you in the abyss!

1822
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:45,690
Can you spawn shit in the abyss?

1823
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:49,550
I can spawn stuff in the abyss!

1824
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:50,370
Where are you?

1825
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:55,210
I'm signaling to you with my flame.

1826
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,390
My flame is lit!

1827
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:58,690
Wait, do you see my flame too?

1828
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,090
I'm in the void with you!

1829
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:08,530
There's a respawn button.

1830
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:17,010
I see a flame flickering in and out.

1831
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:21,310
Let me spin around in circles.

1832
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:24,310
It's beautiful.

1833
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:29,150
I'm sorry, I did not know that.

1834
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:30,710
How do you respawn?

1835
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:34,490
I love Christmas!

1836
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:45,110
I'm giving you Christmas.

1837
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:46,910
I want single bells.

1838
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,670
Jingle bells!

1839
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:59,710
We should play this while we light up the statue.

1840
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,010
I'm kind of disappointed it didn't blow up though.

1841
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:07,390
Can we spawn only green and red?

1842
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:09,630
And see if we can do like...

1843
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:11,210
Hundreds of Christmas...

1844
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:12,690
Mail toes?

1845
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:17,370
Wait, can we blow this guy up?

1846
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:18,510
He's a mapper green.

1847
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:19,930
No, you can't blow him up.

1848
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,610
I don't think anything in this world is destructible.

1849
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:23,770
What is this though?

1850
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:25,070
This guy got blown up.

1851
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:26,670
Oh my god, he did!

1852
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:28,310
He's in pieces!

1853
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:31,550
He's fully intact for me.

1854
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:36,030
Oh yeah, this guy too.

1855
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:37,490
No you can't!

1856
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:39,690
We committed murder today.

1857
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:41,750
Who did we kill?

1858
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:44,530
We killed a Minecraft villager.

1859
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:46,530
Look over here!

1860
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:49,490
Come here!

1861
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:51,710
I can't even kill the...

1862
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:52,890
I can't kill the zombie.

1863
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:55,430
This guy is definitely alive.

1864
01:24:56,110 --> 01:24:57,030
Is he alive on your screen?

1865
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:57,810
What about this one?

1866
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:03,950
I don't know about this guy.

1867
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,190
I think he's...

1868
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,870
Yeah, I think he's a god.

1869
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:10,910
Do we have a doctor in the house?

1870
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:12,350
Do we have a doctor in Minecraft?

1871
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:17,290
Why is the music so loud?

1872
01:25:24,230 --> 01:25:26,530
This map is huge!

1873
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:31,870
Merry Christmas!

1874
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,130
Merry Christmas everybody!

1875
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:35,750
Happy Holidays!

1876
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:37,410
You guys want me to download another map?

1877
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:39,150
Yes!

1878
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,010
Yeah, give us some realistic nukes!

1879
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:45,950
I'm watching the server guys!

1880
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:50,670
I wanna get realistic nukes!

1881
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:53,190
Alright, where is the realistic nuke?

1882
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:54,970
I have like five of them.

1883
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:56,510
Do you want me to load the server?

1884
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,490
Oh, I found it!

1885
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:01,190
Is that it?

1886
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:04,450
Yeah, give us the Breaking Bad characters too.

1887
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,310
I thought I downloaded it.

1888
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:08,330
I'm pretty sure I did, but...

1889
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,730
There's realistic humans?

1890
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:12,350
There's like traffic codes.

1891
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:13,330
Oh, this is snow!

1892
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:15,090
We can do snow weather.

1893
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:20,390
Did I not download Breaking Bad?

1894
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:21,290
Oh, I did it!

1895
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:22,390
Okay, I got Breaking Bad.

1896
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:25,590
There's 7.6k people that downloaded Breaking Bad.

1897
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:27,310
Probably good then.

1898
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:30,170
What's pre-loaded packings?

1899
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:31,470
Is it all together?

1900
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:35,650
What is this?

1901
01:26:36,370 --> 01:26:37,350
What is the fucking...

1902
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:39,870
Oh, can you get the Spray Mania?

1903
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:41,150
Can you get the Spray Mania?

1904
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:42,810
Spray Mania?

1905
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:43,370
Yeah, sure.

1906
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:45,630
I'll download that too.

1907
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:47,990
Oh, color explodes!

1908
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:48,910
Yeah, looks cool.

1909
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:50,690
That looks cool.

1910
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:52,870
Okay, I got the Breaking Bad characters.

1911
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:56,650
Let's see...

1912
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:58,350
I like how...

1913
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,970
I like how...

1914
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:02,130
German city district...

1915
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:03,870
Has 9.3k...

1916
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,870
1000 people...

1917
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:07,250
What the fuck?

1918
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:09,690
Why is it all German?

1919
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:11,990
I don't understand.

1920
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:15,570
Why is it so popular in Germany?

1921
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:18,170
Alright, let's see...

1922
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:19,830
Maybe fireworks are banned there.

1923
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,310
So this is all they got.

1924
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,850
They have Rick and Morty garage map.

1925
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:25,750
Cloudsdale for my little pony!

1926
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,030
Cloudsdale!

1927
01:27:27,190 --> 01:27:28,250
Oh my god, do it, please!

1928
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:29,990
Please!

1929
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:33,430
It's the newest mods, I'm scared.

1930
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:36,830
Mint's out here like, I wanna blow up my little pony!

1931
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:42,870
There's a Rick and Morty garage map!

1932
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:44,890
Rick and Morty!

1933
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:46,070
Oh my god.

1934
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:49,310
They have one called Winter Kingdom.

1935
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:51,590
There's the moon!

1936
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:52,770
Let's blow up the moon!

1937
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:54,850
I'd subscribe to Cloudsdale.

1938
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:55,750
Nice!

1939
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:56,890
Oh god!

1940
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,450
Oh, there's some sort of...

1941
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:02,350
Tomorrow Mania is like a circus one.

1942
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:04,530
And there's Wild West.

1943
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:07,050
I like how there's literally a green screen.

1944
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:10,490
There's a green screen map!

1945
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:14,870
Yeah, this is actually my side hustle.

1946
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:21,530
I go and record a bunch of HD pictures of green screen fireworks and then sell them individually as graphics.

1947
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:24,690
For those who need to use it for their videos Ew!

1948
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:29,190
There's a fast food mod but the picture is horrible.

1949
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:31,070
What is this?

1950
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:33,890
It's like spaghetti croquet.

1951
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:35,430
What is that?

1952
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:36,910
Ew!

1953
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:40,470
Oh, I saw Cloudsdale.

1954
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:41,310
Oh my god, please.

1955
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:45,270
Don't worry guys, I downloaded the Gamer Girls mod for you guys.

1956
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:46,890
Just for you guys.

1957
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:47,630
Yeah.

1958
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:50,570
Oh my god.

1959
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:52,690
Wait, there's a Simpsons map.

1960
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:54,110
There is, yeah.

1961
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:55,010
But it's hidden run.

1962
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:57,390
Yeah, yeah.

1963
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:59,990
I don't know if it's a good map because it's hidden run.

1964
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:01,270
I don't know if there's like inside.

1965
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:04,250
Because the hidden run is mostly just outside.

1966
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:05,050
Right, right.

1967
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:06,250
That's fair.

1968
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:08,410
Alright, let's see.

1969
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:11,930
Is there anything else you want me to download?

1970
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:13,470
There's just Arizona.

1971
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:17,470
Those are...

1972
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:18,890
They miss Arizona.

1973
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,090
They just really miss Arizona.

1974
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:24,490
I really specifically want to set fireworks off in Arizona.

1975
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:25,330
I don't know why.

1976
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:27,590
It's just something I've wanted to do my entire life.

1977
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:30,270
There's a Predators pack?

1978
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,710
The fuck?

1979
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:33,910
Oh, it's just a firework company named Predators.

1980
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:35,870
I was like, the fuck is a Predators pack?

1981
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:37,710
There's a moon map.

1982
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:40,710
Yeah, yeah, that's what I was saying.

1983
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:41,930
We could blow up the moon.

1984
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:45,450
I downloaded the fast food mod.

1985
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:46,970
You see it, right?

1986
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,790
What is that?

1987
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:50,890
It's literally a picture of a fast food.

1988
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:55,770
Wait, there's an abandoned asylum.

1989
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:57,710
I think this is a phasmophobia asylum.

1990
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:00,790
Alright, I'm setting up this.

1991
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:02,530
I'm going to create the server.

1992
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:05,170
Alright, do we want Cloudsdale?

1993
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:06,650
Rick and Morty Garage?

1994
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:09,330
That's the two I downloaded.

1995
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:12,130
That's the two I downloaded.

1996
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:14,530
Cloudsdale, right?

1997
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:16,250
We want to blow up Cloudsdale.

1998
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:17,730
Did you download Poopsmoke?

1999
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:21,330
Okay, why do you want Poopsmoke?

2000
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:24,130
Why wouldn't you want Poopsmoke?

2001
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:28,350
Why do you want that?

2002
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:30,070
Why wouldn't you want Poopsmoke?

2003
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:33,130
Alright, I downloaded Poopsmoke just for you.

2004
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:34,670
Just because you asked for it.

2005
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:36,710
Okay, come back.

2006
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:37,810
I ran out of toilet paper.

2007
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:41,170
Oh, I guess Duffy wanted it too.

2008
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:41,930
What?

2009
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:44,010
What do I want?

2010
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:45,950
Are you okay?

2011
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,870
You're out of breath, girl.

2012
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:49,730
I had to run all the way downstairs.

2013
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:52,410
Because literally my two upstairs bathrooms don't have any toilet paper.

2014
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:54,950
So I was literally just running around being like...

2015
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:58,010
You know where the Poopsmoke came from.

2016
01:30:58,510 --> 01:31:01,190
Yeah, you know where the Poopsmoke came from.

2017
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:01,870
Hey!

2018
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,430
That was a piss only kind of run.

2019
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,130
That was piss speed.

2020
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:11,150
Okay, I don't know if we want to upset the mouse, but there is a Disney castle mod.

2021
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:12,830
So...

2022
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:14,850
Oh yeah, I downloaded it.

2023
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:17,770
They laid off fireworks all the time.

2024
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:18,650
True!

2025
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:21,650
I like how we started this game...

2026
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:23,170
We started this game and we were like...

2027
01:31:23,170 --> 01:31:24,530
Man, people mod this game?

2028
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:25,230
That seems weird.

2029
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:26,530
And now we're sitting here like...

2030
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:28,130
No, we have this mod and this mod.

2031
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:30,690
Guys, add us in this game.

2032
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:33,110
Oh, that would be so cool.

2033
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:34,130
I know, right?

2034
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:35,090
Add us to the game.

2035
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:36,050
Make us blow up.

2036
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:38,730
Make us blow up.

2037
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:41,570
Don't add us as avatars, add us as fireworks.

2038
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:42,550
So you can let them fire.

2039
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,090
Oh my god, guys.

2040
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,610
This map is taking...

2041
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:52,490
Cloudsdale, for some reason, is taking a very long time to load.

2042
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:54,830
It just sounds like Gmod style.

2043
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:57,230
I'm not even sure what it might be.

2044
01:31:57,630 --> 01:31:59,370
We don't even know what it looks like.

2045
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:00,270
Okay, there we go.

2046
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:03,350
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

2047
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:04,030
Give me the code.

2048
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:10,930
This is a weird map.

2049
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:13,770
Wait, no.

2050
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:15,070
I think Cloudsdale is broken.

2051
01:32:15,650 --> 01:32:16,930
It doesn't matter, it's fine.

2052
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:18,890
Are we getting the...

2053
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:21,210
Counter-strike source texture here?

2054
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:22,550
No, Cloudsdale is mega broken.

2055
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:23,830
Like, what did I load?

2056
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:26,410
It's literally just...

2057
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,320
I want to see!

2058
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,700
No, it's not exciting.

2059
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:33,980
No, I want to see!

2060
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:37,040
It's not exciting.

2061
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,760
It's called Cloudsdale.

2062
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,400
Of course you're in the clouds.

2063
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,980
Okay, but there usually is a city.

2064
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,100
A city in Cloudsdale.

2065
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,420
No, there's not.

2066
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,580
I see the city.

2067
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:48,460
Give me the code.

2068
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,680
Okay, I'm coming in.

2069
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,260
I'm downloading.

2070
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,800
Okay, so you're gonna be like...

2071
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,840
Where the fuck am I?

2072
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,880
And then I found the actual city part.

2073
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,760
Okay, okay.

2074
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,500
See, you doubted it.

2075
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,560
You doubted it and you almost made us miss out.

2076
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:06,760
No, it's still not very impressive.

2077
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:09,300
Doubted the majesty of Cloudsdale, what the fuck.

2078
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,320
No, it's still not impressive.

2079
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,080
What are you eating?

2080
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:15,340
Oh, my game just...

2081
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,420
What the hell?

2082
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,280
It's in your mouth.

2083
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:19,080
It's a cake.

2084
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:21,060
I'm eating a dessert.

2085
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:25,260
You got a matcha cake.

2086
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,180
Awfully sweet.

2087
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:30,560
Why do you have clouds?

2088
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:32,300
I'm gonna be Batman in Cloudsdale.

2089
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,420
Cloudsdale is taking a while to load.

2090
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:36,100
Cloudsdale is huge.

2091
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,340
I told you.

2092
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,520
It's like huge.

2093
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:41,000
It's like Cloudsdale.

2094
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,140
Actually, I can be Jesse Pinkman.

2095
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:44,660
I'm almost there.

2096
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,360
I'm loading in.

2097
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:47,320
I'm dropping.

2098
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:50,820
I'm gonna be Scooby-Doo because he's the only other one that would be on all fours.

2099
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:52,740
No, he's not.

2100
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:55,020
He's not on all fours.

2101
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,780
Where's our pony avatar?

2102
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,200
You are a skeleton.

2103
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,000
A spooky, scary skeleton.

2104
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:05,180
Send shivers down my spine.

2105
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:06,140
Send shivers down my spine.

2106
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:07,980
What else can I be?

2107
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,840
I can be hot, though.

2108
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,380
Here we go.

2109
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,040
Me too.

2110
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:14,700
Mine loaded at the exact same time.

2111
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,220
When you load in, you're like, what is this?

2112
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:23,060
When you load in, you're like, how is this Cloudsdale?

2113
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:24,760
Oh my god.

2114
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:26,100
Oh my god.

2115
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:28,860
It's clouds.

2116
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:29,700
Where do we go?

2117
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,060
Why are we so small?

2118
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:33,040
What is this?

2119
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:34,300
You go this way.

2120
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:38,100
You go this way and you're like, that's where the city is right here.

2121
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,640
Guys, guys, right here.

2122
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:01,060
Look what I am.

2123
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,740
Can I light the hamburger?

2124
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,180
This is a Fortnite skin.

2125
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:20,380
I'm gonna be a gamer, girl.

2126
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,340
Guys, come over here.

2127
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:24,380
We gotta get to Cloudsdale, guys.

2128
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:27,660
Cloudsdale.

2129
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,540
We gotta get to Cloudsdale, everybody.

2130
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:31,940
This is cool.

2131
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:35,200
I thought I was gonna fall through.

2132
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:39,240
Why is Cloudsdale having such an overcast day?

2133
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:43,440
We're gonna make it to Cloudsdale.

2134
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,440
I'm stuck.

2135
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,620
I'm stuck.

2136
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,180
I'm not gonna make it to Cloudsdale.

2137
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:49,260
I just followed you, Lime.

2138
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:49,880
Oh god.

2139
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:51,420
No.

2140
01:35:53,100 --> 01:35:53,780
We're stuck.

2141
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,700
I'm too sexy to die here.

2142
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,740
Buy yourself some rope with your bathwater funds.

2143
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:02,560
Oh, I made it up.

2144
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,160
See ya, Lime.

2145
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:03,500
No.

2146
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,120
What the fuck?

2147
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,660
Guys, get there.

2148
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:08,440
Guys, what if we fucked up at Cloudsdale?

2149
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:13,880
I think there's a road and Doki took us through the clouds, but there's an actual road.

2150
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:17,480
Why use the road when we have the clouds?

2151
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,840
Don't worry.

2152
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:21,500
The cloud is faster.

2153
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:22,900
No, it's not.

2154
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:24,660
Yes, it is.

2155
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:27,240
Oh, did you find the road too, Snuffy?

2156
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:27,920
Here we go.

2157
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:30,680
Rainbow road.

2158
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,000
How'd you get up to the road?

2159
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,320
I just respawned.

2160
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:35,720
Oh, that's better.

2161
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,800
I saw that.

2162
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,200
I fell through Cloudsdale.

2163
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,960
I fell through Cloudsdale.

2164
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:45,180
I hear them.

2165
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:47,940
Can you guys see me?

2166
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:52,500
You guys are so close.

2167
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:53,300
Hi, Doki.

2168
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,980
As a host, I can TP.

2169
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:56,980
Oh, wow.

2170
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,260
Min is so far.

2171
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:01,980
There's no way she'll be able to, like, overcome a nice TP.

2172
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,920
Is that a Peter Burger?

2173
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,880
Why don't the fries do anything?

2174
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,780
Wait, I have an important question.

2175
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:15,000
If we spawn in 50 Peter Burgers and launch them all at the same time through the link...

2176
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,740
I'm already doing it.

2177
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:20,980
There you go.

2178
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:22,940
Let me launch some Peter Burgers with you.

2179
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:24,440
Oh, no!

2180
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:36,820
I'm respawning.

2181
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,340
I'm taking them down.

2182
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:39,960
Where's the road?

2183
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,040
Wait,

2184
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,680
Doki, can you TP me?

2185
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,540
Just keep going down the road.

2186
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:51,280
I can't.

2187
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,340
Where's the road?

2188
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:53,600
I can't.

2189
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:55,040
I actually can't TP.

2190
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,880
I can teleport to you and be like, hey, then teleport back.

2191
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:01,640
Oh, I found it.

2192
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:02,880
Hey, Min.

2193
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:06,460
Hey, what is...

2194
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:08,220
What is Ethereal Haven?

2195
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:24,240
Celestial Sanctuary, inspired by the grace and freedom of Pegasus, offers panoramic views of the sky and feelings of floating amidst the heavens with billowing clouds as backdrops.

2196
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:27,180
Ethereal Haven provides...

2197
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:41,540
I see the aftermath of all of it.

2198
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:43,540
I'm sorry.

2199
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:50,480
You were trying to have like a discussion over something and we just petered all over it by then.

2200
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:56,440
No, it's just that whoever created this world has like lore.

2201
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:59,240
Wait, there's a nuclear bomb, guys.

2202
01:38:59,280 --> 01:38:59,960
I found it.

2203
01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:31,470
Oh my god.

2204
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:34,210
Oh my god, all the progress I made trying to get to you guys.

2205
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:42,410
I was basically standing on top of it when it went off.

2206
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:43,190
Holy shit.

2207
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:45,810
The rumbling is still happening.

2208
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:47,970
I feel like I have actual hearing loss.

2209
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:52,930
Oh my god.

2210
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:55,630
Where are you guys?

2211
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:56,430
Oh, I see you.

2212
01:39:58,930 --> 01:40:01,130
I'm below the road.

2213
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:01,730
Just let go.

2214
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:06,680
Wait,

2215
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:11,100
who do I see over there?

2216
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:11,800
Who's the skeleton?

2217
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,800
Oh my god.

2218
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:22,220
The thing about the nuke is that you don't even have to light it up.

2219
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,400
You just click it.

2220
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:29,380
You bring it out and it just automatically explodes.

2221
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,380
Look at the nuke.

2222
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,580
Oh god, it's so good.

2223
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,620
Everything hurts.

2224
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:44,360
Holy shit.

2225
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:52,240
I was not supposed to know you don't detonate a nuke.

2226
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:58,660
Oh god.

2227
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,100
Look what I found, guys.

2228
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,860
Oh, what was that?

2229
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:09,140
I was called Angry Badger.

2230
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:11,120
Oh, it didn't do anything.

2231
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:12,140
It just exploded.

2232
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,800
It was just an angry guy.

2233
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,160
Just an angry little guy.

2234
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:20,320
Oh!

2235
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,160
What?

2236
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:27,100
I'm trying all the other different beam ones.

2237
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,340
They're spray mania cannons.

2238
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,020
Yeah, I wanted the spray ones.

2239
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:34,280
Ok, so nuclear bomb, you just place it, right?

2240
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:37,240
Let me stay away from doing it again.

2241
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,440
No, no, no.

2242
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:41,240
This is the sphinx.

2243
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,300
Wow, wow, wow.

2244
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:47,700
Wow, wow, wow.

2245
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:50,440
It's so joyful and small and...

2246
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,360
It's so modest.

2247
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:55,140
So modest.

2248
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:58,280
Oh, whoa.

2249
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,680
What did I just press?

2250
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:00,240
Oh god.

2251
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:04,540
My chat's right.

2252
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:12,540
We downloaded a bunch of mods and we ended up with Peter Griffin, a small kaboom thunder noise and then literally a world ending nuke.

2253
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,120
And I wouldn't have it any other way.

2254
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,160
Hey Mint, what you doing over there?

2255
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:23,020
Whoa.

2256
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:24,600
Whoa!

2257
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:26,740
Whoa!

2258
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,020
Is it me?

2259
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:34,880
Whoa!

2260
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,280
Whoa!

2261
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:41,540
These like realistic fire effects are killing me.

2262
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,660
This is what you've always wanted.

2263
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:44,220
What?

2264
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,240
Oh, here we go, here we go.

2265
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:52,340
Light the boom, light the boom.

2266
01:42:54,940 --> 01:43:02,080
Ok, so if we spawn a ton of those in, we can have the world's largest firebat MP3.

2267
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,400
Delete button, I'm getting out the delete button.

2268
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:06,700
The what?

2269
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,420
That doesn't exist, that doesn't exist.

2270
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,460
What is the wand of wizards?

2271
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:19,840
I'm off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz.

2272
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,240
I've enshrouded myself in a shield.

2273
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,600
Oh my god.

2274
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:24,560
Oh.

2275
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,760
Oh, poop.

2276
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,220
Poop.

2277
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:30,900
Wingardium Leviosa.

2278
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:33,560
Oh my god.

2279
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,760
Wingardium Leviosa.

2280
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:36,440
This was very normal.

2281
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:39,460
Shrouded in poops.

2282
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:41,340
I need help.

2283
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:42,960
This is my protection.

2284
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,240
Are you having...

2285
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:46,720
I don't think anyone would want to go in there.

2286
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,160
I don't think anyone would want to go in there after that.

2287
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,680
I need to light them all up.

2288
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,740
I helped you with that.

2289
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,500
Oh god, I'm seeing colors.

2290
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:14,360
Like, what's happening?

2291
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:19,420
Why is some of the poop dropping off from the poop sphere?

2292
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:22,060
Can you get out?

2293
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:23,200
Can you get out of there?

2294
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:25,860
Some of them lit, not all of them.

2295
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,180
I got a little yellow.

2296
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:31,360
Maybe if you put post-paint take in the middle, it'll light everything up.

2297
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,920
Yeah, I usually drop propane if I want everything to go off.

2298
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,460
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2299
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,320
This is like the kind of thing you do to your neighbors you don't mind.

2300
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:46,800
You regularly light poop on the neighbors and you're just like...

2301
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,820
Oh, they didn't...

2302
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:50,500
I think actually they went off.

2303
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,600
It's just that they did the thing where they don't despawn.

2304
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,800
My poop shield is...

2305
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:58,060
gone.

2306
01:44:58,300 --> 01:44:59,500
The evil has been defeated.

2307
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:02,200
We never even made it to Cloudsdale.

2308
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:04,460
I know, we never even got there.

2309
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:06,600
We never made it.

2310
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:11,940
The nuke dropped and we never...

2311
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:13,860
Oh my god, I get the 300k!

2312
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:14,900
Yay, let's go!

2313
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:20,280
Wait, hold on.

2314
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:22,720
Yay!

2315
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:26,600
Here, I'll celebrate.

2316
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,080
I wasn't gonna show my face.

2317
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:28,720
No!

2318
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,380
Yay, yay, yay, yay!

2319
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:36,040
Yay, yay, yay, yay!

2320
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,300
Yay, yay, yay, yay!

2321
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:37,500
Thank you guys!

2322
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:40,420
Thank you guys!

2323
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:41,860
Yeah, this is Cloudsdale.

2324
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:44,220
What's the lore of Cloudsdale?

2325
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:45,820
What's the lore of the weather factory?

2326
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:51,440
Thank you guys!

2327
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:56,900
Yay!

2328
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:01,440
I mean, three!

2329
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,220
I got stuck, hold on.

2330
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:07,500
Three!

2331
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:09,980
Three!

2332
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,140
What?

2333
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:12,380
What did you press?

2334
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:15,720
Thank you guys!

2335
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:16,920
Thank you!

2336
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:29,300
Oh my god, it's insane!

2337
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:31,060
It's insane!

2338
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:35,160
Yours did an instant detonate!

2339
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:39,880
I literally put it on the floor and it just...

2340
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:43,280
Mine had the bomb noise going.

2341
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,520
The way this makes my audio sound is so funny.

2342
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,880
My eardrums are rumbling.

2343
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:50,160
Like, oh my god.

2344
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:54,640
Goodbye, Cloudsdale.

2345
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:55,880
Goodbye, Cloudsdale.

2346
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:57,540
You guys wanna do a new map?

2347
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:58,560
You wanna do one last map?

2348
01:46:58,860 --> 01:46:59,300
Yay!

2349
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:07,980
I set off like a wave of peters at the same time as the nuke and I thought for a second the peters had broken the fucking server.

2350
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:12,820
We spawned one too many peters.

2351
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:15,880
That's what I wanna do.

2352
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,020
I wanna do the biggest peter explosion we can.

2353
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:21,020
Where do we...

2354
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:22,460
Okay, I'm looking at the maps.

2355
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:25,840
Let's take us to the German village!

2356
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,820
It all started!

2357
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:28,920
We have to go!

2358
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:30,380
We have to go.

2359
01:47:30,380 --> 01:47:35,040
We wanna do the German village to download custom German village map.

2360
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:38,260
German village...

2361
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:40,700
Is there any other mods that we want, guys?

2362
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,840
Any specific...

2363
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,620
My game crashed.

2364
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,460
No way!

2365
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:48,820
You're not even in the game yet and it crashed.

2366
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:54,880
We downloaded German village and they're like, alright, that's enough.

2367
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:56,740
You're not German enough.

2368
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:59,180
Dude, I'm German for this.

2369
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:00,180
Wait, there's one.

2370
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:01,420
The welcome to hell mod.

2371
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:02,040
What is that?

2372
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:08,940
Yeah, I saw that but I think it's just more more firework stuff.

2373
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:12,900
There's like random Oh wait, there's ambience mod.

2374
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:13,220
What the fuck is ambience?

2375
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:27,780
If you had all the patience in the world on that original map, you could do like a trail of propane tanks and fireworks that surround the entirety of the town and then go off on like a time delay by doing it with a connection thing.

2376
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:32,000
Take us to Arizona.

2377
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,760
Are we going to Arizona instead of Germany?

2378
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:40,840
And then the description says the mod have added a horse that go kaboom.

2379
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:42,160
Wait, what?

2380
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:43,080
What is it called?

2381
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:44,540
The horse go boom.

2382
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:45,960
The horse go boom.

2383
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,200
Where are you finding these?

2384
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:50,800
And it says the mod have added a horse that go kaboom.

2385
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,840
The picture is so ominous.

2386
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:09,980
I kind of want to know also what happens if you spawn in like a ton of peter burgers and then everyone spawns a nuke at the same time.

2387
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:11,980
Oh my god, yeah.

2388
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:13,800
That's our finale.

2389
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:15,360
Yeah, that's right.

2390
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,740
Finalize the stream by crashing the shit out of the game.

2391
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,680
Are we doing Arizona or German village, guys?

2392
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,060
Whichever.

2393
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,080
Pick wisely.

2394
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:26,580
Germany.

2395
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:28,580
Germany.

2396
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:31,480
Yeah, Arizona is literally a desert.

2397
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,460
I just looked at it.

2398
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:35,040
It's just a desert.

2399
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:38,440
Alright, I have a lot of mods now on it.

2400
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:41,340
Yes, 100 plus mods.

2401
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:42,840
Germantown.

2402
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,520
We're going to be the 125.

2403
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:53,890
Oh my god, it's going so fast.

2404
01:49:54,050 --> 01:49:58,570
Oh my god, we're in the fucking train station.

2405
01:49:58,730 --> 01:50:00,610
We're in the subway.

2406
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:02,250
Let us in.

2407
01:50:02,570 --> 01:50:03,250
Give us a car.

2408
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:07,290
I'm going to attach explosive to the railway.

2409
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:10,470
What the hell?

2410
01:50:11,690 --> 01:50:13,670
I'm going to rescue a beautiful damsel.

2411
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:15,830
I think the FBI is watching us.

2412
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:20,470
Why are there so much fewer servers now?

2413
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:21,130
I don't know what happened.

2414
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:22,970
All our friends left.

2415
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:25,650
I think it's because people are going to sleep in EU.

2416
01:50:27,810 --> 01:50:30,790
The Europeans are heading to bed right now.

2417
01:50:31,010 --> 01:50:33,910
Before they go to bed, they light up a couple of fireworks.

2418
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:39,650
I got my fireworks that night before I head to bed.

2419
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:45,090
Nothing gets me settled to sleep than lighting up a couple of peter burgers.

2420
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:52,170
My duty as an American.

2421
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:55,330
Right, I guess I should be European for that.

2422
01:50:55,610 --> 01:50:56,870
What the fuck?

2423
01:50:56,970 --> 01:50:58,590
You can light up a fucking cat?

2424
01:50:59,210 --> 01:50:59,510
What?

2425
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:00,670
Wow!

2426
01:51:02,270 --> 01:51:02,810
No!

2427
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:05,990
How's it going, Angelina?

2428
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:06,950
Don't do the cat.

2429
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:09,730
Here we go.

2430
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:12,030
Oh my god!

2431
01:51:13,230 --> 01:51:14,830
We're going to light up a cat!

2432
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:19,270
Oh my god, look at them fly!

2433
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:24,510
Oh my god!

2434
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:27,370
What's this horror movie?

2435
01:51:28,190 --> 01:51:29,610
Let's get out of this subway.

2436
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:30,870
Let's go see the world.

2437
01:51:31,290 --> 01:51:33,310
The world!

2438
01:51:35,290 --> 01:51:36,550
How do we get out of here?

2439
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:37,670
Doki?

2440
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:40,130
This is actually really scary looking.

2441
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:42,850
I don't like how long this show is.

2442
01:51:42,850 --> 01:51:43,750
Why is it so...

2443
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:51,670
Why is it so red outside?

2444
01:51:53,010 --> 01:51:53,650
What's happening?

2445
01:51:53,810 --> 01:51:55,630
What are these?

2446
01:51:56,090 --> 01:51:58,190
Oh my god, there's so many of them already.

2447
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:00,450
Wait, I have an idea.

2448
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:02,870
What if I set off a crowd of peter burgers on the back of a big one?

2449
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:03,630
I want a peter burger.

2450
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:06,030
Let's put that down here.

2451
01:52:06,770 --> 01:52:07,730
And then put a bunch of peter burgers on it.

2452
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:09,670
She's off to see the moon!

2453
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:10,670
Wait, the horse!

2454
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:12,510
Oh my god, guess what?

2455
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:15,730
This is the horse.

2456
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:16,730
What is that?

2457
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,830
This is the horse.

2458
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:22,190
Peter, the horse is here.

2459
01:52:23,490 --> 01:52:24,010
That's it?

2460
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:26,950
The horse is underwhelming.

2461
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:29,530
The horse sucks, no wonder it didn't have a good run.

2462
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:31,730
Oh my god, what is this?

2463
01:52:32,030 --> 01:52:33,070
What is this creation?

2464
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:35,590
This just makes me know that I have to...

2465
01:52:35,590 --> 01:52:37,690
We can ask first people to put us in the game.

2466
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:41,310
If the horse can exist, somebody can light me on fire and shoot me in the head.

2467
01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:42,430
It's literally the workshop.

2468
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:45,010
Anybody can put anything in there.

2469
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:48,530
This is going to become as big as Left 4 Dead 2.

2470
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:49,170
I swear.

2471
01:52:52,870 --> 01:52:55,150
Do we have to also put nukes?

2472
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:56,530
Should we all put a nuke together?

2473
01:52:57,470 --> 01:52:57,950
Oh god.

2474
01:52:58,210 --> 01:53:00,210
Oh no, they're going off.

2475
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:04,270
Oh my god, someone took a picture of the actual cat!

2476
01:53:04,330 --> 01:53:05,070
It's a firework!

2477
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:06,490
That's Maxwell!

2478
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:08,790
Who doesn't know Maxwell?

2479
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:09,650
What, Doki?

2480
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:13,230
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

2481
01:53:27,650 --> 01:53:32,850
Oh god, my game is literally frozen.

2482
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:34,490
My game is frozen!

2483
01:53:35,490 --> 01:53:41,890
I am frozen.

2484
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:43,230
I think it might have...

2485
01:53:43,230 --> 01:53:45,070
Everything is white.

2486
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:48,890
Don't go to the light!

2487
01:53:57,930 --> 01:53:59,370
I'm back.

2488
01:53:59,450 --> 01:54:00,170
What's up everybody?

2489
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:04,090
What was that?

2490
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:05,910
Was that the other nuke?

2491
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:08,650
That was the nuke with the pita burger.

2492
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:11,590
I don't think we should combine the pita burgers with the nuke anymore.

2493
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:13,890
We should do it with the actual nuke.

2494
01:54:14,110 --> 01:54:16,170
We should do it with the regular nuke one.

2495
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:17,910
With the RGB blaster.

2496
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:20,710
I got a TNT, guys.

2497
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:22,210
Don't make me do it.

2498
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:23,130
You got what?

2499
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:26,470
What's that under?

2500
01:54:26,530 --> 01:54:27,210
Oh my god!

2501
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:28,770
It's huge!

2502
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:33,450
It's so big!

2503
01:54:42,510 --> 01:54:44,650
Wait, what's the skeleton one?

2504
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:46,110
Spooky scary skeleton.

2505
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:47,230
It was nothing.

2506
01:54:47,390 --> 01:54:49,550
It's just literally normal fireworks.

2507
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:55,250
I want to set off this bomb without it being attached to a bunch of stuff.

2508
01:54:55,650 --> 01:54:58,890
I'm going to set this bomb up.

2509
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:00,290
I just want to see what it does.

2510
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:02,690
That's the one that broke the game!

2511
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:05,010
No, it was the pita burgers that did it.

2512
01:55:12,850 --> 01:55:14,150
That's so beautiful!

2513
01:55:16,570 --> 01:55:17,050
Pretty!

2514
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:20,050
Oh my god!

2515
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:23,410
See, when you don't decorate it with pita burgers it doesn't break the game.

2516
01:55:24,190 --> 01:55:25,370
Mobstone spawn, guys.

2517
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:28,130
Make sure to light it up to mobstone spawn.

2518
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:33,250
Spooky scary skeleton.

2519
01:55:35,370 --> 01:55:36,290
That thing's got a cool rhythm.

2520
01:55:36,830 --> 01:55:38,750
Where did you get the Minecraft stuff?

2521
01:55:39,930 --> 01:55:41,190
Oh, I found it.

2522
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:46,350
Wait, I want to see Maxwell without the nuke going off.

2523
01:55:47,590 --> 01:55:49,430
Go, my Christmas rockets, go!

2524
01:55:52,370 --> 01:55:53,510
There he goes!

2525
01:55:53,690 --> 01:55:54,810
Go Maxwell, go!

2526
01:55:55,690 --> 01:55:56,990
There he goes.

2527
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:59,510
Go Maxwell, go!

2528
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:02,030
He's getting in there, guys.

2529
01:56:02,980 --> 01:56:05,050
Oh, Maxwell, no!

2530
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:09,450
Oh, he was so chill.

2531
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:10,390
What happened?

2532
01:56:10,450 --> 01:56:11,170
What's going on?

2533
01:56:12,330 --> 01:56:13,770
Snuffy found Christmas rockets.

2534
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:14,810
Christmas!

2535
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:17,930
Oh no, they're just actual rocks.

2536
01:56:19,970 --> 01:56:22,290
Guys, I can actually build a house.

2537
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:28,490
Guys, I'm going to play Minecraft now.

2538
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:30,410
Yes, Minecraft!

2539
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:35,670
The nuclear bomb is actually a firecracker?

2540
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:41,910
Wait, you have actual Minecraft blocks.

2541
01:56:44,510 --> 01:56:46,490
Doki, is this a different bomb?

2542
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:48,310
What is?

2543
01:56:48,730 --> 01:56:49,130
Look!

2544
01:56:50,110 --> 01:56:51,990
Wait, what the...

2545
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,750
I found this.

2546
01:56:54,190 --> 01:56:55,590
This is different.

2547
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:56,030
Uh-oh.

2548
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:56,930
Wait a second.

2549
01:56:57,170 --> 01:56:57,610
Uh-oh.

2550
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:23,720
Why is it close to the firecracker?

2551
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:24,540
Holy shit.

2552
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:29,820
I tried to blow up Doki's house with the...

2553
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:33,080
Oh my god.

2554
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,000
It looks like hell on earth.

2555
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:38,040
Welcome to Germany.

2556
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:40,500
Oh wow, there's a little ferris wheel.

2557
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:41,040
How cute!

2558
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:44,020
Where did you guys end up?

2559
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,340
Oh no, not again.

2560
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:46,940
Snuffy!

2561
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:52,260
Where are you guys?

2562
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:53,920
I haven't found you yet!

2563
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:08,520
I can't!

2564
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,980
I just keep bouncing in the air for the whole time.

2565
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,860
I turned around and saw how many there were.

2566
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:34,020
That was like three of them, by the way.

2567
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:37,400
They look like ten.

2568
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,840
It could be ten.

2569
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:49,140
I can't believe German engineering has made these structures so strong.

2570
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:50,700
How about we play hide and seek?

2571
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:54,980
Someone plants a bomb and then lights it and you have to find it in time.

2572
01:58:55,940 --> 01:58:59,260
You have to dismantle the bomb.

2573
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:02,120
I feel like I'm hearing noises weird now.

2574
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:03,460
Everything sounds weird.

2575
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:08,360
It's like the top exploding game.

2576
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:12,460
We played that, it was fun.

2577
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:13,260
Wasn't it, Snuffy?

2578
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,400
Where did everybody go?

2579
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,840
I'm by visual imagination.

2580
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:22,760
Oh, hello!

2581
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:27,680
Look, look, come here.

2582
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:31,160
I found this.

2583
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:34,800
Where are you guys?

2584
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:36,100
You did, you did find that.

2585
01:59:36,140 --> 01:59:36,900
What are you going to do with it?

2586
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:38,100
I'm going to add more.

2587
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:38,980
Where are you guys?

2588
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:44,180
They're hiding, they don't want us to spawn nukes where they are.

2589
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:50,520
Why are there so many nukes?

2590
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:56,240
Be careful of this area.

2591
01:59:58,200 --> 01:59:59,400
Wait, where is everybody?

2592
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,800
Snuffy, you'll know.

2593
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:04,560
Toki, don't do it!

2594
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,840
I'm lowering the volume.

2595
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,280
07 everyone.

2596
02:00:18,580 --> 02:00:20,200
I found Snuffy!

2597
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:26,760
I found Snuffy!

2598
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:34,000
Oh my god!

2599
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:43,800
This is the world's most resilient town.

2600
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:45,580
Anyone want some hot dogs?

2601
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:58,680
That one, it was all one giant explosion, but when Snuffy did it before I could see each cloud forming in the air.

2602
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:02,680
I think it's because we're all bunched up together, so you put him like...

2603
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:06,400
We don't need to do that again, guys.

2604
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:13,460
This one's just called Kitty Poop.

2605
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:15,760
Yeah, this one is the little cat.

2606
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:20,520
I just blew up a Galaxy Note 7.

2607
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:26,280
Wait, I wanted to see the Kitty Poop!

2608
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:28,080
Now I'm stuck in a back alleyway.

2609
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:29,720
I'm actually stuck in here.

2610
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:33,100
Wait, no!

2611
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:37,460
Ok guys, drastic times ask for drastic measures.

2612
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:38,100
I'm sorry.

2613
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,720
I need to get out of here.

2614
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:46,240
Sorry, I have to get out of here.

2615
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:48,080
Oh my god, it's over.

2616
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,460
Sorry, I got out of bounds.

2617
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:52,500
Sorry.

2618
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:52,820
Hello?

2619
02:01:53,380 --> 02:01:54,100
Is somebody calling?

2620
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:55,200
Hi Snuffy!

2621
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,380
Did you see the fucking beaters?

2622
02:02:12,580 --> 02:02:13,480
The beaters!

2623
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:15,980
The random beaters!

2624
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:20,240
Oh my god, I'm out in the road.

2625
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:30,780
For a minute, I thought that was the fucking Galaxy Notes because they went off at the same fucking time.

2626
02:02:30,980 --> 02:02:34,300
I like how the timing of Snuffy being like, is somebody calling?

2627
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:39,400
Did you see the Galaxy 7?

2628
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,460
Oh yeah, the Galaxy.

2629
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:45,080
Galaxy 7, look.

2630
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:45,800
Right here.

2631
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:47,340
Right here.

2632
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:50,360
Galaxy 7, light it up.

2633
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:51,600
Blow it up?

2634
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:52,940
Light it up.

2635
02:02:55,740 --> 02:02:56,560
Mushy mushy!

2636
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:03,200
How many fingers do you think we have right now?

2637
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:04,360
Do you think we lost them all?

2638
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:07,800
We have all sorts of radiation.

2639
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:10,180
No, no!

2640
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:18,240
Why are the beaters such a problem?

2641
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:19,000
Holy shit.

2642
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:26,100
I'm trying to fill up all my props with just the beater spawns.

2643
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:27,040
I want to hear them.

2644
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,200
I will help you.

2645
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:30,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2646
02:03:30,600 --> 02:03:31,220
Grand finale, I will help you.

2647
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:32,300
Grand finale, beaters.

2648
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,180
More beaters.

2649
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:35,060
Beaters for everyone.

2650
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:36,860
Send me off, launch me.

2651
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:41,620
Wait, I want to see what the pause is on Snuffy with beaters and propane tanks.

2652
02:03:41,640 --> 02:03:43,440
I'll go far away, I'll go far away.

2653
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:45,600
I want to see what the pause is.

2654
02:03:47,700 --> 02:03:49,440
You can see it from over here.

2655
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:56,100
As many beaters as I can withstand.

2656
02:03:56,240 --> 02:03:57,540
It's like a beaternado.

2657
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:01,160
Yeah, this is like my, this is my little shelf.

2658
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:06,740
I mean Snuffy, do you want them set up with a propane tank or do you want me to shove a nuke in the middle?

2659
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:08,100
I think nukes.

2660
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:14,660
I think we should just admit that we really want to put as many nukes as we possibly can and just accept that.

2661
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:16,740
That's something we should do.

2662
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:20,740
Oh, that was loud.

2663
02:04:20,940 --> 02:04:21,780
That was so loud.

2664
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:22,540
It was horrible.

2665
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:25,800
I'm spiraling outwards.

2666
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:27,860
It looks like a hat.

2667
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:29,340
It looks like a hat.

2668
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:37,640
Okay, I can't put anything else down.

2669
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:39,040
If you guys have more nukes.

2670
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:40,040
I'm done for fireworks.

2671
02:04:40,220 --> 02:04:42,040
Can someone who still has a slot put the nuke in there?

2672
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,900
Oh my god, the Christmas trees.

2673
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:46,960
Do we put a nuke in the middle?

2674
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:48,620
Yeah, put a nuke in the middle.

2675
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:49,560
Maybe remove a Christmas tree.

2676
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:49,960
Nuke in the middle.

2677
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:51,020
Okay, okay, okay.

2678
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,200
You got it?

2679
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:52,880
You got the nuke?

2680
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:53,120
Okay.

2681
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:54,780
I'm gonna put a little kitty in there.

2682
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:56,460
I can have the nuke in there.

2683
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,600
Who's doing the nuke?

2684
02:04:58,060 --> 02:04:59,200
Oh, I can do the nuke.

2685
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,460
I can do the nuke.

2686
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:00,840
Oh, yeah.

2687
02:05:00,940 --> 02:05:01,680
Where is it?

2688
02:05:01,940 --> 02:05:02,880
Oh, here we go.

2689
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:04,100
Excuse me.

2690
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:05,080
Excuse me.

2691
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:06,600
And then we'll put the Christmas tree on top.

2692
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:07,800
Oh, uh, okay.

2693
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:10,260
If my stream crashes, I'll miss all of you.

2694
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:13,060
Before we light it up, let's put a Christmas tree at the top.

2695
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:13,840
Okay.

2696
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:14,280
Yeah, yeah.

2697
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:15,480
For the holiday season.

2698
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:17,060
You think it'll like...

2699
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:19,040
I'll put a little bit of propane there for fun.

2700
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:20,100
Hold on, let me...

2701
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:20,980
I've got plenty of propane.

2702
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:22,140
For the holiday season.

2703
02:05:22,300 --> 02:05:22,800
Put Maxwell?

2704
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:23,840
Yeah, I'll put Maxwell.

2705
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:27,000
I'll put one American dollar on the nuke.

2706
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:30,180
Uh...

2707
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:35,600
Oh, wait, before we do, let's put Christmas rock in here.

2708
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:38,440
Oh, you wanted to go off singing?

2709
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:39,040
That's fair.

2710
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:39,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2711
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:40,220
Oh, yeah.

2712
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:41,900
Yay.

2713
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:46,060
Oh, oh, wait, there's two nukes.

2714
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:51,640
Alright, well, light it up.

2715
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:57,460
Yes!

2716
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:03,900
I hear them, I hear them!

2717
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:05,340
I hear the Peters!

2718
02:06:11,420 --> 02:06:13,760
Merry Christmas, everybody!

2719
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:25,960
Oh my god, it's beautiful.

2720
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:28,360
Happy New Year!

2721
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:33,000
I still hear the music.

2722
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:33,980
How do I hear it?

2723
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:37,320
I can't hear the music anymore, I got blown too far away.

2724
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:47,480
Merry Christmas, everybody, and a Happy New Year!

2725
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,520
Happy New Year!

2726
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:49,320
Merry Christmas!

2727
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:51,000
Happy New Year!

2728
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:51,820
Yeah!

2729
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:56,520
Wait,

2730
02:07:00,100 --> 02:07:00,920
why'd it stop playing?

2731
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,660
I think the song ended.

2732
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:04,040
Oh.

2733
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:05,920
Damn, the show's over.

2734
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:06,860
Go home.

2735
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:08,320
It's Jingle Bells time.

2736
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:10,360
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.

2737
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:12,620
Closing time!

2738
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:16,600
I got blown up so far.

2739
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:18,320
Yeah, gang, yeah, woo, yeah!

2740
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:19,340
Woo, gang, woo!

2741
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:24,140
Merry Christmas!

2742
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:25,340
Yeah!

2743
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:27,720
Merry Christmas, everyone!

2744
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:28,660
Merry Christmas!

2745
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:29,800
Merry Christmas!

2746
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:30,140
Merry Christmas!

2747
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,500
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...

2748
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,540
I see that Peter Burger.

2749
02:07:36,980 --> 02:07:38,340
Just one, just one, just one.

2750
02:07:39,460 --> 02:07:40,260
It's beautiful.

2751
02:07:45,860 --> 02:07:47,340
This was so fun!

2752
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:50,460
Oh my gosh, this was a good pick for game.

2753
02:07:51,820 --> 02:07:52,460
Thank you!

2754
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:53,520
Thank you, guys.

2755
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:54,980
Good job, everybody.

2756
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:56,000
Thank you, guys.

2757
02:07:57,720 --> 02:07:59,010
Just some good old...

2758
02:07:59,010 --> 02:07:59,610
Merry Christmas!

2759
02:08:00,110 --> 02:08:01,170
Merry Christmas!

2760
02:08:01,650 --> 02:08:01,890
Merry Christmas!

2761
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:02,850
It was so fun, guys!

2762
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:04,130
Oh, I should be a Santa too.

2763
02:08:04,370 --> 02:08:05,190
Tee -tees, everybody!

2764
02:08:06,030 --> 02:08:06,090
Tee -tee!

2765
02:08:06,470 --> 02:08:07,330
Tee-tee!

2766
02:08:07,790 --> 02:08:10,250
It was a good game for the holiday season.

2767
02:08:10,510 --> 02:08:10,790
Yeah.

2768
02:08:11,730 --> 02:08:13,910
Very happily, we ended in German Village.

2769
02:08:14,070 --> 02:08:16,090
Oh, I've been a sexy girl this whole time.

2770
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:16,970
Oh my god.

2771
02:08:17,630 --> 02:08:19,030
I'm gonna be the OG Santa.

2772
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:22,930
No, nobody crashed.

2773
02:08:23,070 --> 02:08:23,690
We're too powerful.

2774
02:08:24,210 --> 02:08:25,050
Or I'll be the...

2775
02:08:25,790 --> 02:08:27,350
Wait, Odoki crashed on the menu.

2776
02:08:27,630 --> 02:08:27,910
Yeah!

2777
02:08:27,910 --> 02:08:30,270
That's the only crash we had.

2778
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:31,710
Yeah.

2779
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:33,710
Okay.

2780
02:08:34,910 --> 02:08:36,790
Touch the flames, touch the flames.

2781
02:08:36,870 --> 02:08:37,910
Wait, we can all be...

2782
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:39,110
Touch the flames.

2783
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:40,990
Yeah, be your most effective Santa.

2784
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:43,470
Touch the flames.

2785
02:08:43,650 --> 02:08:45,230
Wait, I can't...

2786
02:08:45,230 --> 02:08:47,210
Hold on, I'm gonna switch Santa.

2787
02:08:47,330 --> 02:08:48,370
I can't see any...

2788
02:08:48,370 --> 02:08:49,070
Wait, which one?

2789
02:08:49,650 --> 02:08:51,370
You gotta be Red Santa.

2790
02:08:51,570 --> 02:08:52,110
Oh, Red Santa?

2791
02:08:52,270 --> 02:08:52,390
Okay.

2792
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:53,610
Yeah, yeah.

2793
02:08:53,730 --> 02:08:54,570
All different Santas.

2794
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:57,450
Just rub the tips together a little bit.

2795
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:58,290
Just a little.

2796
02:08:59,010 --> 02:09:01,070
Me and my homies just touching tips.

2797
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:01,670
Yeah.

2798
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:07,430
This is a Santa ritual.

2799
02:09:07,610 --> 02:09:09,150
All of mall Santas do this.

2800
02:09:09,170 --> 02:09:10,110
All the Santas get...

2801
02:09:10,110 --> 02:09:11,530
This is how we deliver the presents.

2802
02:09:11,630 --> 02:09:12,770
We're lighting up the Christmas tree.

2803
02:09:16,410 --> 02:09:18,110
Before the Christmas Eve.

2804
02:09:18,110 --> 02:09:20,250

02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:55,830
Beautiful.

2824
02:10:01,570 --> 02:10:03,410
Wait, are we the only ones here?

2825
02:10:04,270 --> 02:10:05,890
Yeah, it's just you and me.

2826
02:10:10,090 --> 02:10:10,690
Snuffy.

2827
02:10:11,710 --> 02:10:12,310
Snuffy.

2828
02:10:17,550 --> 02:10:18,750
Blue Santa.

2829
02:10:19,650 --> 02:10:21,490
Oh, you're Santa Prime.

2830
02:10:22,170 --> 02:10:23,150
No, no.

2831
02:10:23,810 --> 02:10:25,690
You're the Santa I've always wanted to be.

2832
02:10:26,710 --> 02:10:28,130
I'm Proto Santa.

2833
02:10:28,770 --> 02:10:31,330
They found out red was a more popular color.

2834
02:10:32,890 --> 02:10:37,050
Now I'm gonna have to end you just like Shadow the Hedgehog.

2835
02:10:39,690 --> 02:10:41,570
It's all them pita burgers.

2836
02:10:42,490 --> 02:10:44,570
Oh, I should take another one.

2837
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:47,270
What is Doki doing over there?

2838
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:56,360
What?

2839
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:59,460
I can't even imagine leaving this game on and not thinking what could happen.

2840
02:10:59,620 --> 02:10:59,980
Right?

2841
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,480
We could do anything.

2842
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:04,880
We could do anything.

2843
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:11,040
Oh god.

2844
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:15,320
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

2845
02:11:43,940 --> 02:11:45,900
It never gets old, dude.

2846
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,640
It doesn't, it's so good.

2847
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:58,440
Bye bye!

2848
02:12:04,810 --> 02:12:05,930
That was so good.

2849
02:12:07,470 --> 02:12:08,610
That was so good, guys.

2850
02:12:08,670 --> 02:12:10,390
Before I leave, before we leave...

2851
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:12,590
Oh my gosh, I can add all the mods we want.

2852
02:12:12,990 --> 02:12:14,330
Let's go to our own place.

2853
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:17,570
I'm gonna get to Arizona.

2854
02:12:20,130 --> 02:12:20,570
Arizona.

2855
02:12:21,690 --> 02:12:22,810
I'm gonna subscribe.

2856
02:12:23,250 --> 02:12:23,490
Alright.

2857
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:25,350
Alright, Arizona.

2858
02:12:26,390 --> 02:12:27,290
Where is it?

2859
02:12:28,050 --> 02:12:28,870
Where is Arizona?

2860
02:12:29,650 --> 02:12:30,110
Arizona.

2861
02:12:31,190 --> 02:12:31,750
Oh, ok.

2862
02:12:31,990 --> 02:12:32,510
Let's go.

2863
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:36,470
Let's just, let's just...

2864
02:12:36,470 --> 02:12:39,650
Before 300k, let's watch our own fireworks.

2865
02:12:40,530 --> 02:12:41,590
Oh, I'm still Santa.

2866
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:43,410
Ew, what is this piss filter?

2867
02:12:43,990 --> 02:12:45,010
Oh my god.

2868
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:46,970
Oh, the cactus scared me.

2869
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:47,910
I thought they were people.

2870
02:12:49,230 --> 02:12:51,870
Let's just do our own fireworks.

2871
02:12:52,330 --> 02:12:54,130
Just us, you know.

2872
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:58,230
Just hanging out and being, you know.

2873
02:12:58,390 --> 02:12:59,490
Let's see, what do we want?

2874
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:01,410
I'm gonna get a bunch of really cool ones, ok?

2875
02:13:01,970 --> 02:13:03,750
Let's just do one of each or something.

2876
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:05,350
Let's just, you know.

2877
02:13:06,170 --> 02:13:06,690
Viper.

2878
02:13:07,450 --> 02:13:08,190
Viper 2.

2879
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:09,270
Viper 2.

2880
02:13:09,870 --> 02:13:10,910
Magic Sky.

2881
02:13:11,890 --> 02:13:12,630
I mean, hello!

2882
02:13:13,550 --> 02:13:14,290
Hello, hello!

2883
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:15,770
Fried potato.

2884
02:13:16,890 --> 02:13:17,410
Hamburger.

2885
02:13:19,090 --> 02:13:19,850
Cluster.

2886
02:13:21,230 --> 02:13:22,650
Christmas rocket.

2887
02:13:23,610 --> 02:13:24,470
Wait, I already did the magic.

2888
02:13:24,570 --> 02:13:25,030
RGB.

2889
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:27,710
Whatever this says.

2890
02:13:28,210 --> 02:13:29,610
World stopper.

2891
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:31,450
Wait, I think I did that one too.

2892
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:32,750
Amazing granny.

2893
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:35,110
Amazing granny 2.

2894
02:13:37,030 --> 02:13:41,410
Ok, and some cakes.

2895
02:13:41,850 --> 02:13:42,450
Some cakes.

2896
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:45,490
We'll do the fat bill because that sounds big.

2897
02:13:45,490 --> 02:13:46,410
Let's do...

2898
02:13:47,450 --> 02:13:48,490
Let's do wrap.

2899
02:13:49,030 --> 02:13:49,770
Oh, so tiny.

2900
02:13:50,350 --> 02:13:52,430
Let's do...

2901
02:13:52,430 --> 02:13:53,750
Low ride.

2902
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:54,910
Oh, so tiny.

2903
02:13:55,590 --> 02:13:56,990
Let's do the messenger.

2904
02:13:58,010 --> 02:13:59,590
Let's do beehive.

2905
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:01,090
Wait, how do I rotate these?

2906
02:14:01,370 --> 02:14:02,290
I don't remember.

2907
02:14:02,410 --> 02:14:02,790
It's fine.

2908
02:14:04,650 --> 02:14:05,590
Let's Nautilus.

2909
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:08,070
Let's do 2024.

2910
02:14:08,070 --> 02:14:08,350
2024.

2911
02:14:14,550 --> 02:14:15,730
Dragon battery.

2912
02:14:17,750 --> 02:14:21,130
Oh, there is Nautilus.

2913
02:14:22,450 --> 02:14:22,830
Alrighty.

2914
02:14:24,590 --> 02:14:27,230
If I do one of these, will it do them all?

2915
02:14:28,150 --> 02:14:28,870
Let's do kitty.

2916
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:32,670
Let's do where is Maxwell in the novelty, right?

2917
02:14:34,450 --> 02:14:34,950
How do I...

2918
02:14:34,950 --> 02:14:36,610
You can make them bigger?

2919
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:38,310
No way.

2920
02:14:42,830 --> 02:14:45,010
You can make them big...

2921
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:45,630
Oh my god.

2922
02:14:45,890 --> 02:14:47,110
You can make them bigger...

2923
02:14:47,110 --> 02:14:48,230
Oh, I think it's far...

2924
02:14:48,230 --> 02:14:50,930
I don't think it's bigness.

2925
02:14:51,010 --> 02:14:51,730
I think it's...

2926
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:53,850
I think it's how far away it is from you.

2927
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:55,530
What is alpha lupus?

2928
02:14:55,690 --> 02:14:55,810
Ok.

2929
02:14:56,370 --> 02:14:56,690
Alright.

2930
02:14:57,570 --> 02:14:58,870
Sounds like a...

2931
02:14:58,870 --> 02:15:00,310
Like a joke, you know?

2932
02:15:01,270 --> 02:15:01,790
Ok!

2933
02:15:02,650 --> 02:15:03,170
300k!

2934
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:06,010
Maybe I should...

2935
02:15:07,250 --> 02:15:08,010
Oh, whoops.

2936
02:15:08,230 --> 02:15:09,630
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

2937
02:15:11,910 --> 02:15:12,390
No.

2938
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:14,190
Oh gosh.

2939
02:15:16,930 --> 02:15:17,890
Oh no.

2940
02:15:22,270 --> 02:15:25,450
Anyway, I meant to do this one.

2941
02:15:28,090 --> 02:15:28,570
Wait.

2942
02:15:32,750 --> 02:15:33,390
Oh gosh.

2943
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:34,330
I think it was buried.

2944
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:36,110
Oh, Senpai!

2945
02:15:36,350 --> 02:15:37,030
Thank you!

2946
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:38,150
Congrats on 300k.

2947
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:39,910
Thank you so much!

2948
02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:40,390
Thank you!

2949
02:15:40,590 --> 02:15:40,690
Thank you!

2950
02:15:40,690 --> 02:15:40,990
Thank you!

2951
02:15:40,990 --> 02:15:41,290
Thank you!

2952
02:15:41,330 --> 02:15:42,090
Thank you!

2953
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:43,590
Thank you!

2954
02:15:44,230 --> 02:15:46,450
I just wanna see some pretty fireworks.

2955
02:15:46,690 --> 02:15:48,830
Just, you know, just us guys, you know?

2956
02:15:49,830 --> 02:15:50,410
Thank you.

2957
02:15:50,450 --> 02:15:52,450
I had to turn the volume way down low.

2958
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:53,910
So...

2959
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:54,850
Because of, you know...

2960
02:15:54,850 --> 02:15:55,950
Oh wait, maybe I do this...

2961
02:15:56,490 --> 02:15:58,070
Oh, well, I'm not gonna do it last.

2962
02:15:58,170 --> 02:15:59,570
Because I already pressed it.

2963
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:01,870
We'll do Peter Griffin last.

2964
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:03,750
Ok!

2965
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:21,110
Happy 300k!

2966
02:16:23,490 --> 02:16:25,470
Oh, that was literally just an explosion.

2967
02:16:28,010 --> 02:16:28,410
Wow!

2968
02:16:29,310 --> 02:16:30,650
That went so cool!

2969
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:31,310
That went up there.

2970
02:16:31,850 --> 02:16:33,670
Wow, that went, that went, that went.

2971
02:16:35,170 --> 02:16:35,570
Thank

2972
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:43,740
you guys!

2973
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:44,140
Wait.

2974
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:47,720
Wait, before, before, before, before, before...

2975
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:49,140
Hold on, I'm gonna disappear for a second.

2976
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:54,200
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna appear to you in 2D.

2977
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:55,100
I hope you guys don't mind.

2978
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:57,800
I'm gonna appear to you in 2D.

2979
02:16:58,220 --> 02:16:59,100
Real quick.

2980
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:01,420
I hope you guys don't mind.

2981
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:03,480
Appear in 3...

2982
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:04,180
Oh, not 3D.

2983
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:04,820
2D.

2984
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:07,160
One second.

2985
02:17:07,580 --> 02:17:09,700
So I can properly say hello.

2986
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:11,280
Properly say hello.

2987
02:17:12,640 --> 02:17:13,700
Oh, whoops.

2988
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:18,040
And properly say thank you.

2989
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:25,060
2D.

2990
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:27,700
Let me put on some music.

2991
02:17:28,140 --> 02:17:29,040
Because it's really quiet.

2992
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:40,560
Oh yeah, I'll do this one.

2993
02:17:48,910 --> 02:17:50,170
Oh, there we go.

2994
02:17:50,390 --> 02:17:51,270
I was like, what the heck?

2995
02:17:51,470 --> 02:17:52,190
I'm not moving.

2996
02:17:53,690 --> 02:17:54,010
Yay!

2997
02:17:55,330 --> 02:17:56,290
Minto jump scare.

2998
02:17:58,690 --> 02:17:59,330
Yay!

2999
02:18:00,150 --> 02:18:00,390
Yes,

3000
02:18:04,170 --> 02:18:06,030
thank you for 300k!

3001
02:18:10,850 --> 02:18:12,130
I really appreciate it!

3002
02:18:12,470 --> 02:18:14,450
I hope you guys like the fireworks today.

3003
02:18:15,430 --> 02:18:15,970
And...

3004
02:18:15,970 --> 02:18:16,250
Yeah!

3005
02:18:17,010 --> 02:18:19,090
Keep working hard to...

3006
02:18:19,610 --> 02:18:21,230
To get even more!

3007
02:18:23,310 --> 02:18:25,490
And then hopefully that leads to more opportunities.

3008
02:18:26,210 --> 02:18:27,610
And cool stuff for...

3009
02:18:28,590 --> 02:18:28,710
For...

3010
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:30,670
For all of us to do.

3011
02:18:31,390 --> 02:18:31,650
Yeah!

3012
02:18:32,250 --> 02:18:32,990
Thank you!

3013
02:18:33,970 --> 02:18:36,490
What a stream to hit 300k on, right?

3014
02:18:38,890 --> 02:18:39,770
What a stream.

3015
02:18:40,630 --> 02:18:41,530
This is so fun!

3016
02:18:41,630 --> 02:18:42,430
I'm glad I picked it.

3017
02:18:43,490 --> 02:18:47,090
I saw that it was just a thing with multiplayer and I was like...

3018
02:18:47,090 --> 02:18:47,950
This looks goofy.

3019
02:18:48,490 --> 02:18:50,230
Oh, the mods made it so much better.

3020
02:18:51,730 --> 02:18:53,150
The first explosion...

3021
02:18:53,150 --> 02:18:56,910
The first snuffy fireworks explosion was so good.

3022
02:18:58,770 --> 02:19:00,410
Thank you for all the congratulations!

3023
02:19:01,150 --> 02:19:01,890
Thank you!

3024
02:19:01,890 --> 02:19:03,210
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3025
02:19:04,470 --> 02:19:04,890
Happy!

3026
02:19:06,930 --> 02:19:07,550
Happy!

3027
02:19:08,390 --> 02:19:08,960
I honestly...

3028
02:19:10,430 --> 02:19:12,100
I honestly was like...

3029
02:19:12,410 --> 02:19:12,810
You know...

3030
02:19:12,810 --> 02:19:13,890
It's kind of like...

3031
02:19:15,810 --> 02:19:16,990
It's kind of...

3032
02:19:16,990 --> 02:19:19,270
You know, I didn't think that it would be...

3033
02:19:19,270 --> 02:19:19,890
You know...

3034
02:19:21,090 --> 02:19:22,330
Maybe possible...

3035
02:19:22,330 --> 02:19:23,270
Like on my own.

3036
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:26,130
So...

3037
02:19:26,130 --> 02:19:27,070
You know...

3038
02:19:27,070 --> 02:19:29,750
Things like this can be...

3039
02:19:30,930 --> 02:19:32,570
Uphill challenge for me usually.

3040
02:19:33,010 --> 02:19:33,690
I'm kind of...

3041
02:19:33,690 --> 02:19:35,750
You know, I'm kind of used to like being...

3042
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:40,810
How do I say?

3043
02:19:42,050 --> 02:19:42,530
Like...

3044
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:43,890
I don't want to say an afterthought.

3045
02:19:45,890 --> 02:19:46,370
Like...

3046
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:46,770
You know...

3047
02:20:09,750 --> 02:20:10,230
But...

3048
02:20:12,270 --> 02:20:12,750
Okay!

3049
02:20:13,150 --> 02:20:14,130
I'm gonna go now.

3050
02:20:15,050 --> 02:20:15,530
So...

3051
02:20:15,530 --> 02:20:16,730
Have a good night!

3052
02:20:16,810 --> 02:20:17,390
Have a good day!

3053
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:18,390
And I'll see you guys...

3054
02:20:19,090 --> 02:20:19,510
What's...

3055
02:20:19,510 --> 02:20:20,590
Tomorrow is Saturday, right?

3056
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:22,550
I have a...

3057
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:23,410
DMC!

3058
02:20:23,570 --> 02:20:23,790
Yeah!

3059
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:25,290
Otsumito!

3060
02:20:26,050 --> 02:20:26,610
Otsumito!

3061
02:20:26,770 --> 02:20:27,090
Otsumito!

3062
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:27,650
Otsumito!

3063
02:20:29,310 --> 02:20:30,430
Bye bye!

3064
02:20:31,530 --> 02:20:31,710
