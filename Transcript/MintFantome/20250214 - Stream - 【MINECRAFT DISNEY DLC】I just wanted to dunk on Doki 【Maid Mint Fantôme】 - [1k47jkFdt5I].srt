1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,340
2, 1, swap!

2
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,160
Wait,

3
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,220
we have to sing the better one.

4
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,380
We have to sing the better one.

5
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,820
I always wanted a brother.

6
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,860
I always wanted a brother.

7
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:47,580
I always wanted a brother.

8
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,340
I always wanted a brother.

9
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,420
I always wanted a brother.

10
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,540
I always wanted a brother.

11
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,720
Just like you.

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,340
What did you say about my brother?

13
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,500
That's how straight up my brother.

14
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,820
For those who don't know what skin I'm on.

15
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,940
I don't know, what was the thing that changes your POV?

16
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,100
F5.

17
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,940
F5?

18
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,240
I'm not allowed.

19
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,080
I always wanted a brother.

20
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,200
It's not as straight as my brother.

21
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,940
It's my brother.

22
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,740
Just like you.

23
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,280
So guys, today we're here to explore.

24
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,880
Look at this.

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,020
We're going to become Disney.

26
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,200
Explore world's adventures.

27
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,320
We know where we wanna go.

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,260
Oh yeah.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,140
We were originally gonna do the Disney world one.

30
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,220
And then I was looking up Minecraft DLC.

31
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,680
I saw this.

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,580
So we switched.

33
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,320
I was like, oh my god.

34
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,860
But what do you mean adventure mode?

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,020
Wait, there's quests?

36
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,940
Yeah, there's quests to unlock more worlds.

37
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,980
So I guess we go sandbox.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,640
We can go straight to Simba.

39
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,300
But we do adventure with the explore all the worlds.

40
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,780
I was gonna say, I don't wanna.

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,140
I mean, we can try one maybe.

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,300
But I don't wanna like...

43
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,520
If it's bad, we'll just go straight to the one we really wanna go to.

44
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,100
We can do that.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,040
Yeah, so...

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,080
I always have to go to...

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,940
Guys, if you're wondering why I have to tap the dressing room.

49
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,340
For some reason for me.

50
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,300
If I tap out, it kicks me out of the lobby.

51
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,980
So, this is my solution to that.

52
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,460
Alright, sound guy.

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,220
Let me know if everything is okay for us.

54
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,060
For me and Mint.

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
Hello, hello, hello.

56
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,320
Hello, hello, hello.

57
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,420
Hello, everybody.

58
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,980
But yes, if we finish this, we'll go to Disney World.

59
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,560
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,500
It's like our reward.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,080
Oh, did you buy that one?

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,160
No, I didn't.

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,500
Me neither.

64
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,840
But I feel like we should both buy it just for the skin pack.

65
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,080
Unless you wanna be a furry to Disney World.

66
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,200
Alright, here we go.

67
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm pressing the button.

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
I'm pressing it.

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,100
Woah.

70
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,080
Oh my god, that's scary.

71
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,600
Where are we?

72
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,920
Wait, we're in Alice in Wonderland.

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,740
Is this Alice?

74
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,420
No.

75
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,300
Wait, no.

76
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:13,940
Where are we?

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,580
I don't know.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm gonna jump.

79
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm gonna jump.

80
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,420
Oh my god, she's swimming, Naya.

81
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,640
Naya!

82
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,680
You can't contain me.

83
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,500
Can you feel the love tonight?

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,940
What the hell did I just grab?

85
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,400
Oh, how odd.

86
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,100
A visitor.

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,540
Seems you found this little refugee.

88
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,480
It's been a while since anyone else has shown up.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,780
It's quite exciting.

90
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm sure you feel the same.

91
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,060
But anyway, you must be wondering about all this.

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,440
Lucky for you, you're speaking to me.

93
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,560
While I lack an awakeness, I make up for it with knowledge.

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,820
To fill you in, this is the Dream Pavilion and it can lead you to all sorts of magical places.

95
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,920
You may or may not have seen before.

96
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,440
I hear they sometimes appear in our most treasured dreams.

97
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,320
The Dream Pavilion is a place of connection and records.

98
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,680
From here, you can always see what's happening.

99
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,320
You just need to know where to look.

100
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,580
However, if there's anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask.

101
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,400
Oh my god, where am I?

102
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,420
Movie bar in.

103
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,080
What is that?

104
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,780
Wait.

105
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,400
Wait, I didn't want to use this.

106
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,420
What's going on?

107
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,680
There's a library here.

108
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,200
What's happening?

109
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,100
The record book of dreams.

110
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,440
It will automatically journal all sorts of information.

111
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,920
Just flip through.

112
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,640
In addition to the pavilion and the side rooms, this realm has some places to explore as well.

113
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,660
You can find some goodies around, I think.

114
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,260
Not that.

115
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,700
There's gems.

116
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,260
Gem shards.

117
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,740
Collecting them will store them here.

118
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,480
They will grant certain powers.

119
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,740
What is happening?

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,320
Oh, okay.

121
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
We have a compass.

122
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,200
This is the gem wand.

123
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,160
It'll get you back here.

124
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,140
This is so elaborate.

125
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,280
This is so elaborate.

126
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,140
But it needs to be powered up first with a handy map.

127
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,880
And this is the crystal compass.

128
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,360
It's a peculiar device with many different powers.

129
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,060
But it runs on gem shards, so you'll need to collect some first before you can use any of them.

130
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,200
That should be it.

131
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,720
Do take care of it, but I'm sure you can handle it.

132
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,360
You forgot the yawn.

133
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,340
Okay, I got the quest.

134
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,260
I have a gem wand.

135
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
I already have a key.

136
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,760
There's mini games.

137
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,080
I'm gonna unlock something.

138
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,680
The wand, like, transports us to places.

139
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,140
Yeah, it said, like, do you want to return to the hub?

140
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,680
Okay, we got Aerial World.

141
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,920
Oh my god, look at our map.

142
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,780
Snow White.

143
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,240
We got Alice in Wonderland.

144
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,800
Aladdin.

145
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,440
Activate to detect...

146
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,420
What the fuck?

147
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,480
I can cross wide gaps to get temporary speed boost.

148
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,400
Now push heavy boxes.

149
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,740
Oh, we are too stupid for this.

150
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,940
Where do you think?

151
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,340
Who are you?

152
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,400
You too.

153
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,640
Who is that?

154
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,840
Is that some kind of ostrich?

155
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,980
Zazu keeps going on about Nala and I being betrothed.

156
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
I can't marry her.

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,760
She's my best friend.

158
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,520
Wait,

159
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,840
it better not be the water hole again.

160
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,960
No, it's not.

161
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,760
Uncle Scar told me about it.

162
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,320
Like, he told you about the elephant graveyard and we almost got eaten by hyenas?

163
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,020
That is different.

164
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,640
No one said it's forbidden.

165
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,920
Oh, he's a bad boy.

166
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,780
Maybe we should ask Zazu.

167
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,060
Fine, let's go to Pride Rock.

168
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,440
You coming, new friend?

169
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,440
Oh my god, look.

170
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,500
It's right over here.

171
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,980
Oh my god, there's Pride Rock!

172
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,440
It looks a lot smaller than I imagined.

173
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,700
Where's the rest of the animals?

174
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,440
Oh yeah, it's just because they ate them all.

175
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,040
It's like extinction here.

176
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,520
Isn't that the forbidden graveyard over there?

177
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,340
I think so.

178
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,860
We gotta get the gems too.

179
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,320
Oh my god!

180
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,860
Oh wait, three gems nearby before they disappear.

181
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,540
Wait, what do you mean by that?

182
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,640
Before they disappear again?

183
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,660
Oh my god, it's time?

184
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,180
I think so.

185
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,520
I see them, I see them.

186
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,160
Where, where?

187
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,780
It's a blue gem.

188
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,720
I think.

189
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,340
Can I hit you?

190
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,500
I thought I turned PvP on.

191
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,580
You turned PvP on!

192
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,880
I tried!

193
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,020
Oh my, Disney won't let us commit violence.

194
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,140
Yeah, we tried to turn PvP on, you guys.

195
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,040
I tried to turn PvP on.

196
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,120
Oh my god, it's Abras!

197
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,440
Eat it, eat it!

198
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,520
There's only like four of each animal.

199
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,700
They've really done numbered.

200
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,980
It's Noah's Ark!

201
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,340
They've done numbers.

202
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,200
The lions are too hungry.

203
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,380
I'm so hungry.

204
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,180
Wait, what's this?

205
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,340
Oh my gosh, it's an elephant!

206
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,980
Oh my god, wait, is there also only four elephants?

207
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,640
They're so tiny.

208
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,780
They're really small.

209
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,460
I think so.

210
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,480
They're really tiny elephants.

211
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,460
Wait, there's Scar!

212
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,360
Wait, where?

213
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,580
Oh my god, my hero!

214
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,960
Wait, oh my god!

215
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,840
There he is!

216
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,860
What is he saying?

217
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,840
Read it.

218
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,380
I'm reading.

219
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,380
I wonder when my brother will next descend from on high to mingle with the commoners.

220
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,620
Oh, that's it?

221
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,800
That's all he's got to say?

222
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,660
That's where the comedy is?

223
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,200
How dare you?

224
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,420
My dad said I'll be king next.

225
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,380
Everybody look left.

226
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,440
Everybody look right.

227
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,160
Everybody look up.

228
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,300
Standing in the spotlight.

229
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,040
Not yet.

230
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,040
Yeah, I am a Nepo baby.

231
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,160
Oh my god, this elephant's climbing a tree.

232
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,520
I should turn down my music.

233
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,940
Yeah, how's the audio, everybody?

234
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,140
Actual, like, original music, too, for this game.

235
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,700
I know!

236
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,080
That's crazy.

237
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,300
It's looking Minecraft.

238
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,580
It's like Minecraft version of...

239
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,620
What the hell is this?

240
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,140
Oh, it's a wildebeest.

241
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,240
That's gonna kill my dad.

242
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,480
Oh my god, yeah.

243
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,140
That's the dad killer.

244
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,200
That's gonna kill my dad.

245
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,520
This is where I'm almost dying.

246
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,900
It looks like it needs to eat.

247
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,720
It's so skinny.

248
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,640
It's so starving.

249
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,180
How hungry are you?

250
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,820
Oh my gosh, wait.

251
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,640
Timon and Pumbaa gotta be in there.

252
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,580
Oh, Timon and Pumbaa's here.

253
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

254
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,940
Well, I gotta change my clothes real quick.

255
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,580
Oh, me too.

256
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,640
Alright, we're changing, everybody.

257
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,080
We're changing.

258
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,480
Yes.

259
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,280
Where are you?

260
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,640
I'm changing.

261
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,880
You're changing?

262
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh, don't look, guys.

263
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,480
Don't look.

264
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,960
She's changing right now.

265
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,040
Where are you?

266
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,780
Where'd you go?

267
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,640
I'm in front of you.

268
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,420
Do you not see me?

269
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,380
Oh, I'm bloated.

270
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,780
Wait, let me...

271
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,680
Where are you?

272
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,240
Do you see it?

273
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,500
Turn around, turn around.

274
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,480
I don't see it.

275
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,200
Do you not see me?

276
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm in front of you.

277
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,200
Where are you?

278
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,220
Hakuna Matata.

279
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,780
What a wonderful friend.

280
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,560
Where are you?

281
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,340
Oh my gosh, the wildebeest is really freaking out behind me.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm right beside you.

283
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,400
Where are you?

284
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,340
Wait, do you actually...

285
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,580
Wait, let me change.

286
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,860
I'll change my skin.

287
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,820
I'll be sass for a little bit.

288
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,620
So, do you see me?

289
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, I see you.

290
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,400
Do you see sass?

291
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,360
Okay, okay, do you see me now?

292
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,380
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

293
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

294
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,060
Hakuna Matata.

295
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,880
What a wonderful friend.

296
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,420
I wonder how big these worlds are.

297
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,880
Wait, wait, wait.

298
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,420
Look at me.

299
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,480
Look at me real quick.

300
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,520
Oh, are you gonna dab or something?

301
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm gonna...

302
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,400
Wait, what's... Oh, wait, here we go.

303
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,260
It's Hakuna Matata!

304
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,220
Let's go.

305
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,060
We should've been doing quests, but we're just out here.

306
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,540
We're just out here exploring.

307
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,160
Wait, there's a pathway over here.

308
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,840
Oh, we might be able to find an actual Timon and Pumbaa.

309
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,300
Yeah.

310
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,680
And then we'll kill them and take their...

311
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,200
Yeah, what?

312
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,620
We'll take their rolls.

313
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,160
We're skinwalkers.

314
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,800
Oh, I see them!

315
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,720
You see them?

316
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,820
Oh, my God.

317
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,820
Wait, he's so tiny.

318
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,480
Oh, my God, he's so small.

319
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,580
He's so tiny.

320
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,620
Oh, he's freaking out.

321
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
He's like, what the fuck?

322
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,340
Oh, do you remember the old Lion King CD-ROM games?

323
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,000
Did you play them?

324
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,620
No, I didn't.

325
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,500
Oh, my God.

326
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,580
I think that it has to be.

327
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,880
Hey, Timon, come here.

328
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,500
I found...

329
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,180
You know, you think it's a really juicy book grub?

330
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,860
Pumbaa, are you nuts?

331
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,400
That's obviously a big two-legged aardvark.

332
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,760
Oh, they're talking about us.

333
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,560
Look how small he is.

334
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,720
An aardvark?

335
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,160
Yeah, everyone knows aardvarks only eat bugs, so they're not dangerous.

336
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,820
Here, wait.

337
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,340
You voice Pumbaa, I'll voice Timon.

338
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,220
Okay, okay.

339
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,160
All right, come on.

340
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,860
Let's approach.

341
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,520
Slowly.

342
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,680
Okay, I'll be quiet.

343
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
I'm not burping.

344
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,700
You have to!

345
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,860
You can't burp on command!

346
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,140
You have to!

347
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,720
Sorry.

348
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:58,980
Sigh.

349
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,120
And they've spotted us.

350
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,680
Oh, my God.

351
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,440
He's got attitude.

352
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,080
Wow, they look really brave and strong.

353
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,480
Oh, Timon, you don't think?

354
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,500
I guess he does.

355
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,360
What does that mean?

356
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,960
If this is really the protector we were hoping for, we can't be too obvious.

357
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,680
First, we make friends.

358
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,140
With games?

359
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,800
Exactly.

360
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,680
Say, brave warrior, might you be up for some friendly competition?

361
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,860
Yeah, wanna catch some grub?

362
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,260
Are we in?

363
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:38,920
Should we do it?

364
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,600
Yeah, let's get in.

365
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,920
I'm gonna look at instructions first.

366
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,620
I looked at the instructions.

367
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,820
Whoa, there's a cutscene.

368
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,080
Sorry.

369
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,740
Wait, did you go in?

370
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,160
Yeah.

371
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,240
Oh.

372
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,460
Operator's gonna search the part of the jungle to catch as many grub as they can.

373
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,940
But grubs can be tricky.

374
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,380
They may hide under these logs, so you'll need to rustle them out.

375
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,040
Don't forget...

376
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,800
Oh, my God.

377
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, it's a competition.

378
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,860
Wait, are you fighting?

379
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,820
Wait, I see you!

380
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,820
That's not me!

381
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,020
I'm not even...

382
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,260
Oh, okay.

383
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,360
Oh, okay.

384
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,600
Oh, my God.

385
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,180
I'm inside you.

386
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Oh, my God.

387
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,780
There's so...

388
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,160
Oh, my God.

389
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,500
Where are you?

390
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,540
There's so many taboos!

391
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,020
What is this?

392
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,080
Where are the bugs?

393
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:17,580
How do I pick them up?

394
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,240
Oh, I can't leave.

395
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,480
How do I pick them up?

396
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,420
Wait, I don't...

397
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,860
Oh, my God.

398
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,720
You just ate them!

399
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,380
No, no, no!

400
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,060
That's mine!

401
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,160
How do you pick them up?

402
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,680
That's mine!

403
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,240
That's mine!

404
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,260
I didn't read!

405
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,960
You bitch!

406
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,840
The instructions didn't say how to pick them up!

407
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,180
I don't know.

408
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,280
Oh, you just run into it.

409
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,780
They're just eating.

410
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,100
I think.

411
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,620
Oh, wait.

412
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,040
No, you don't.

413
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,800
I don't know.

414
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,820
I don't know!

415
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,240
I got it!

416
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,050
We got five points!

417
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,650
We did it!

418
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,060
I think we're the worst version of Timon and Fumba.

419
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,960
How do we...

420
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,980
They had like five Timons, though.

421
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,540
Like, what the hell?

422
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,880
Why are there five?

423
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,220
Okay, let's read the instructions.

424
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,800
Okay, okay, okay.

425
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,140
Instructions.

426
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,380
Instructions.

427
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,280
Here are the rules.

428
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,660
You just click on the...

429
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,320
Like, the hitbox is so fun.

430
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,460
I tried clicking!

431
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,880
Me too!

432
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,960
They just run up and get them.

433
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,780
This is messed up.

434
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,160
Yeah, this is not fair.

435
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,060
There's like five.

436
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,940
Why are there five Timons?

437
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,020
I don't know.

438
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,700
Okay, okay.

439
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,360
They're multiplying.

440
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,940
Also, didn't they want our help?

441
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,300
Why are they beating us?

442
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,380
Yeah!

443
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,260
Okay, okay.

444
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,560
Okay, I'm trying my best.

445
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,460
How did we get five points before?

446
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,380
I don't know, actually.

447
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,720
I don't know how we got five points there.

448
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,900
How did we grab it?

449
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,820
I grabbed them one time!

450
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,460
It's not letting me!

451
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,720
Oh, it's right click!

452
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,480
It's right click!

453
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,380
It's right click.

454
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,140
Oh my god, I was...

455
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,500
Oh my god.

456
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,160
I got it, I got it.

457
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,840
Oh my god, I got him, I got him.

458
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,980
Wait, there was a guy here.

459
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,640
Oh, I got him.

460
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,420
Yeah.

461
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,420
I like the actual Minecraft music that's happening now.

462
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,860
We can do this!

463
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,960
We can beat them!

464
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,540
We can beat them!

465
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,700
Where are they?

466
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,980
We're better, we're better.

467
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,860
The moment we beat them, we become Timon and Pumbaa.

468
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,840
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna...

469
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,480
Oh, okay.

470
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,780
No, no, no, we almost got it.

471
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,420
We figured it out.

472
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,280
We did it, we did it!

473
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,140
We got 40, I mean, we got 50 points.

474
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,340
We got 50, we did it!

475
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,140
That's right, we're Timon and Pumbaa now.

476
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,780
Yeah!

477
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,420
We're taking your skin now.

478
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,540
I did try right click earlier.

479
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,860
I don't know, probably the hitbox.

480
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,740
Yeah, probably the hitbox.

481
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,600
It's okay, we won.

482
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,220
We won.

483
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,460
We won.

484
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,600
Oh no, no more, please.

485
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,500
You guys can go die now, so we'll be the new Timon and Pumbaa.

486
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,400
We're better.

487
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,720
We stand on two legs.

488
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,800
Wait, what did they want us to do?

489
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
They didn't say congratulations or anything.

490
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,820
Oh, no, they did.

491
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,640
They said it to me.

492
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,180
Oh.

493
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,940
What the hell?

494
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,820
Also, my music died.

495
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,720
It was playing Minecraft music for a little bit, and then it just died.

496
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,900
Wait, I have other emotes?

497
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,120
Oh my god, what are emotes?

498
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,760
Oh my god, I want...

499
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,800
Wait, no, I have to pay for this, nevermind.

500
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,440
Yeah.

501
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,760
Wait, did you pay for your...

502
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,580
Did you pay for your dancing emotes?

503
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,580
I don't think so.

504
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,120
I don't know how I have this.

505
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,320
Wait, how do you have...

506
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,480
I just have a wave.

507
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,780
What's this?

508
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,360
You guys can see it in the top left corner.

509
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,640
I have...

510
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,020
I like the kick part.

511
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,080
It's so good.

512
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,620
Wait, hold on.

513
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I want to see if you do it again.

514
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,940
Wait, no, not that.

515
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,320
Why do I have just regular Minecraft music playing?

516
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,920
Again!

517
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,740
Again!

518
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:16,100
It looks like the Megan dance.

519
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,500
Oh my god, look at him go!

520
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,640
This is not fair, all I could do is clap.

521
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,580
This is not fair.

522
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,040
This has like a skill issue.

523
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,620
It's not fair.

524
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,800
I can't either pay for it or...

525
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
The clouds.

526
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,520
Just notice them.

527
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,000
Wait, there's transformers emotes?

528
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,820
Wait, what the fuck is the transformer emote?

529
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,620
What do you mean by that?

530
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,220
There's like...

531
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,140
How do you find them?

532
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,920
Wait, okay, wait, I'm gonna find them.

533
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,900
Wait, where?

534
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,420
I want to see!

535
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,800
Wait, I'll find them and then I'll show you.

536
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh my gosh, I'm back to normal.

537
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,000
Okay, okay, okay, wait.

538
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,720
How do I...

539
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,120
How do I clip this?

540
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,060
Clip...

541
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,020
No, you gotta...

542
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,220
There's a whole transformer still, see?

543
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,720
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

544
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,360
Watch this.

545
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,960
Watch this, okay.

546
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,660
Okay, okay.

547
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,800
Okay, okay.

548
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,300
He's like, I need to see this too.

549
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,900
Okay, watch this.

550
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,590
It was worth it.

551
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,690
Roll up, transformers.

552
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,190
More than meets the eye.

553
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,810
Wait, look, did you see the lady?

554
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,570
Yeah!

555
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,590
Where do you get the emotes?

556
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,930
Wait, I'm gonna just search.

557
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,870
Transformers.

558
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,130
You know when you press to change emotes...

559
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,950
and you scroll down, there's a transformer icon.

560
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,050
Wait, I don't even remember how I changed it.

561
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,590
There's a...

562
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,770
Oh my God!

563
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,710
Oh my God!

564
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,030
There's a Tetris one.

565
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,670
There's Mega Man?

566
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,790
Oh my God.

567
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,150
Oh, I see, I see.

568
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,610
You see the transformer icon?

569
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,530
Optimus kick.

570
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,790
Wait, you're...

571
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,370
Yeah, mine's the...

572
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,450
For Devotee, you can still see his tail.

573
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,850
What the hell is this?

574
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,750
Oh my God!

575
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,610
What the hell is this?

576
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,870
Wait, there's an angry bird?

577
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,690
Angry bird!

578
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,730
There's Halo.

579
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,730
Anger management, this is so lame.

580
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,870
Wait, there's Spongebob.

581
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,450
Wait, there is?

582
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,170
Oh my God, there's Halo too.

583
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:58,730
Yeah.

584
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,410
Oh, there's Disney, what's this one?

585
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,070
Oh, superhero.

586
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,450
Wait, there's...

587
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,270
Oh my God, wait!

588
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,090
Wait, I just have enough!

589
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,350
I just have enough for this!

590
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,470
Okay, okay, okay.

591
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,930
What's happening here?

592
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,530
Oh my God!

593
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,470
Okay, okay, watch this.

594
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,350
Are you looking?

595
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,290
Hold on, hold on.

596
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,570
I'm looking at my own emotes.

597
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,150
Okay, hold on.

598
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:22,530
Okay, okay.

599
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,390
Do it, do it, do it.

600
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,330
Okay, are you looking?

601
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,270
Yeah, yeah.

602
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,870
No!

603
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,610
Oh wait, you're Sonic ready!

604
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,230
Gotta go fast!

605
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,190
Gotta go faster, faster, faster!

606
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,450
Does it actually make you run faster?

607
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:36,870
Try it.

608
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,890
No, I can't.

609
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,470
I can't move while emoting.

610
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,110
So you just run in place!

611
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,190
Hold on, I'm gonna buy one too.

612
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,390
Wait, not that.

613
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:51,690
Okay.

614
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,990
Guys, which one should I get?

615
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,650
There's so many.

616
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,030
There's so many!

617
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,130
What the hell is this?

618
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,270
Obama the Hedgehog.

619
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,130
Oh my God.

620
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,490
How does this one work?

621
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,450
Oh my God, oh my God!

622
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,970
I like how we're spending money in Minecraft.

623
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,630
I got these points for free, okay?

624
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,050
I'm sure you did.

625
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,090
Wait, there's an actual anime run.

626
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,730
Let's just...

627
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,110
There's actual Naruto.

628
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,510
Oh my God.

629
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,990
They have...

630
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,330
They have Ben 10.

631
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,970
That's how she created it.

632
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,450
There's so many.

633
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,370
There's so many.

634
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,590
Why the fuck do we play Java?

635
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,690
Right!

636
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,890
There's Batman.

637
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,250
We could've had this.

638
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,770
Oh my God, there is anime.

639
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,590
Okay, but I prefer Sonic 1 more.

640
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,290
I don't understand.

641
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,470
What's the squirrel one?

642
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,510
The squirrel one?

643
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,790
Is that from Playing Dead?

644
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,330
What the fuck kind of show is this?

645
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,130
I don't know.

646
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,570
Wait, there's more pages?

647
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,610
Oh my God.

648
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,450
No, the second page is just a little bit.

649
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,930
Oh, there's How to Train Your Dragon here.

650
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,790
What does Ben 10 do?

651
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,290
Going hero.

652
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,090
Oh, it's Ice Age!

653
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,950
The squirrel is Ice Age.

654
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,650
Posing like a hero.

655
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,470
What is this?

656
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,090
Dancing like...

657
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,170
Hakuna Matata.

658
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,010
Oh, there's Hakuna Matata here.

659
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,510
There's just a T-pose.

660
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,050
Wait, why are there two different types of T-poses?

661
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,950
And one is more expensive than the other one.

662
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,470
Wait, what?

663
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,810
I think there's like common versions and then there's rare versions.

664
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,430
But this is literally the same thing.

665
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,810
Yeah, it's the same emote.

666
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,070
What's the difference?

667
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,970
I like the Tetris one.

668
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,830
There is a dab one.

669
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,050
Oh, there's Tetris one.

670
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:03,450
Oh my God.

671
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,990
There's a drop one?

672
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,250
Yeah!

673
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:17,130
What is going on here?

674
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,670
Tetris dance?

675
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,030
That's a good one.

676
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,970
I sort of want to buy this, but it's spent five dollars.

677
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,190
I sort of want to be Tetris.

678
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,270
This is so good.

679
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,090
Oh my God.

680
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,430
There's like some really random ones.

681
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,670
Oh, I see the dab.

682
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,530
I see the dab.

683
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,110
Oh my God, I can make Puma do a dab.

684
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,870
It's his legacy.

685
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,090
Wait, bouncy ball.

686
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,850
Oh my God.

687
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,150
Yeah, he turns into a ball.

688
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,070
I saw that, yeah.

689
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,890
There's one rare.

690
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,810
Wait, maybe there's the ones that we want, but cheaper.

691
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,270
Like, try and find ones that you want, but as a common.

692
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:04,890
You know the gray ones?

693
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,750
I don't think I can find the Tetris one that's cheaper.

694
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:07,930
That's true.

695
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,290
The Tetris one is kind of insane.

696
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:18,030
Why doesn't Java... I know Java, you can have a mod where you can add emotes and stuff.

697
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,890
But like, this is just better.

698
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,750
I think maybe free emotes would be better than this.

699
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,690
But like, can I be a transformer?

700
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,930
What the hell is this?

701
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,170
Okay.

702
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,490
Autobots, roll out.

703
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,890
Oh my God, it's dark.

704
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,210
Wait, what emote did you buy?

705
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,550
I didn't buy one.

706
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,990
Wait, I thought you were going to buy one with your free coins.

707
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,850
Okay, I'll buy one with my free coin.

708
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do it.

709
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,170
Oh, somebody, thank you Cas for the super chat for Tetris.

710
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,770
Thank you, it's worth it.

711
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,030
Wow.

712
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,770
Okay, guys.

713
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,650
That's the only thing I want.

714
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,250
The Tetris one was the only one I want.

715
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,710
Okay, let me buy this.

716
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,290
Don't worry, it's worth it.

717
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,270
Alright, I bought it.

718
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,430
I tabbed out to buy Tetris.

719
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,770
Okay, give me a sec, I'm buying my Tetris emote.

720
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:18,910
No, no, watch me.

721
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,630
Thank you guys for enabling me.

722
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,010
I really appreciate it.

723
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,510
I'm purchasing in progress.

724
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,890
Thanks for the super chat.

725
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,550
Thank you everybody.

726
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,590
Let's do it together, are you ready?

727
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,270
Okay, yeah, yeah.

728
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,830
3, 2, 1, go.

729
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,610
Go.

730
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,700
One more time, one more time.

731
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,840
3, 2, 1, go.

732
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,260
Oh.

733
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,100
Okay, we should progress the world.

734
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,420
Yeah, let's go do the world things now.

735
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,200
Wait, are we doing the quest or do we just want to explore?

736
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,180
I think we could talk to them because they might have stuff for us.

737
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,840
Oh, Simba and Nala?

738
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
We'll be like, sorry, we're too busy Tetrising.

739
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,700
We're definitely Timon and Pumbaa.

740
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,080
Yeah, we're your friends.

741
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,560
Wait, I'm collecting the gems.

742
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,000
What a wonderful phrase.

743
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,700
Do you think we can go to the little crevice that Simba died at?

744
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,780
Yeah, where Simba's dad died?

745
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,720
I think it's here.

746
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,760
I think so too.

747
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,780
I think it's literally here.

748
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,220
Oh my god!

749
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,700
Wait, we can recreate it!

750
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,300
Oh my god, we can recreate it!

751
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,320
Simba...

752
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,660
Wait, there's something over there, do you see it?

753
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,040
Oh my gosh, that's probably his soul.

754
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,420
Oh my god, is that dad?

755
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,840
You're not him anymore.

756
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,780
The gorge.

757
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,680
Oh, what's this?

758
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,400
You collected one collectible of this world.

759
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,560
Oh, is that my dad?

760
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,460
My dad's dead body?

761
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,640
Dad's dead body.

762
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,260
What is that?

763
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,580
What's that?

764
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,200
I can sense gem shards behind...

765
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,300
If only you could jump such a distance.

766
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,740
Oh, it's just to get gem shards.

767
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,780
Yeah, but those unlock things.

768
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,000
It's like my dad's soul, I collected him.

769
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,140
He's just a collectible.

770
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,480
Wait, what if I jump here?

771
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,420
Oh, shit.

772
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,600
Oh, this is where we have to be able to jump.

773
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,700
Wait, I see something else!

774
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,480
Magic wand.

775
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,260
Oh wait, I don't want to return to hub.

776
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,660
How do I...

777
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,840
What the hell is that?

778
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,800
Where are you?

779
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,240
Wait, is that another collectible?

780
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,560
That's what I thought, but it's actually a person.

781
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,300
Oh, it's the hyena!

782
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,460
Yeah, you gotta go up from here.

783
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Alright, what does he say?

784
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,620
Oh, he was a collectible!

785
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh my god, we collected the hyena!

786
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,420
He's ours now.

787
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,960
He's our pet now.

788
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,780
Oh shit, I was so close.

789
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,040
I got it.

790
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,220
Oh, parkour!

791
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,800
Okay, now I don't know what to do.

792
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,560
Jump again?

793
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,800
Okay, now I can't do the jump here.

794
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,460
I think we should...

795
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,040
I thought we were talking to Simba and Nala.

796
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,000
We're going, we're going.

797
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,860
Alright, alright.

798
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,100
Am I looking at the map?

799
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,460
Oh, it's on the other side.

800
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,840
Can you feel the love tonight, Timon?

801
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,200
I can see what's happening.

802
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,560
Some... I don't know.

803
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,360
Oh, there they are.

804
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,480
Oh, there they are.

805
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,100
They fell in love and they're lying.

806
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,020
You can talk to him.

807
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,620
Alright, this is our home.

808
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,400
Pride Rock.

809
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,980
And I'm gonna be the king someday.

810
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,740
Let's hurry up and find Zazu.

811
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,900
Where could he be?

812
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:27,920
Zazu?

813
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,380
Where's Zazu?

814
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,100
Oh god, they're gone.

815
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,460
Oh, okay.

816
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,080
Oh, goodbye.

817
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,780
Okay, we have to find Zazu.

818
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,200
Oh, Zazu.

819
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,380
Like, I'm looking at the map.

820
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,980
Zazu should be like right here.

821
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,380
He's up here.

822
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,540
He's up here.

823
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,160
Wait, he's on Pride Rock?

824
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:45,720
Yeah.

825
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,580
Zazu, what are you doing up here?

826
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,440
That's for the monkey.

827
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,920
Oh my gosh, there's lions in here.

828
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,640
Wait, I wanna see.

829
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,440
Oh, it's Mufasa.

830
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,060
Look, I've never seen a creature like this around here.

831
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,340
Neither have I, Zazu.

832
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,400
But they don't look like trouble.

833
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,140
We're Timon and Pumba.

834
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,140
Hello, I'm Mufasa.

835
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,920
Welcome to- Wait, he's alive!

836
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,120
He hasn't died yet!

837
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,120
Are we gonna recreate their deaths?

838
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,680
Oh my god.

839
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,800
We're gonna recreate their deaths.

840
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,700
Let's go!

841
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,900
I must ask, did my son bring you here?

842
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,380
He has a knack for surprises.

843
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,100
Speaking of your son, sire, I'd better have a look at what he and Nala are up to.

844
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,540
I don't have a good feeling about it.

845
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,080
You never do, Zazu.

846
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,340
We can find Simba outside Pride Rock.

847
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,040
Oh hey, is that mom?

848
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,760
Oh, they don't wanna talk to us.

849
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,040
No, but they have a collectible!

850
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,760
Oh, there's Rafiki!

851
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,200
Rafiki is that thing.

852
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,340
Alright, where is...

853
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,220
It's like over there.

854
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,000
Oh, do we go to the Elephant Graveyard?

855
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,140
Oh, there they are!

856
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:57,940
Where?

857
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,580
I see them.

858
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,400
Right here.

859
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,540
Alright, my turn.

860
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,240
There you are, Zazu.

861
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,500
Can we go to the jungle, please?

862
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,080
The jungle?

863
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,160
Don't be ridiculous.

864
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,160
You have any idea how dangerous that would be?

865
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,700
It's outside the Pride Lands.

866
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,680
Where are more lions?

867
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,100
But Uncle Scar said there's nothing a lion would have to be afraid of there.

868
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,220
Yeah.

869
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,980
A grown lion, perhaps, but a cub?

870
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,560
I'm not so sure.

871
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,680
Come on, Zazu.

872
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,880
It'll be fun.

873
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,260
Besides, what could happen while you're with us?

874
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,700
I'm really not.

875
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,540
Hey, don't you dare run off!

876
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,340
Come back!

877
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,840
Sire, you're here!

878
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,540
Simba...

879
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,320
Mufasa just shows up, pops out, like...

880
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,520
Nala, where do you think you're going?

881
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,600
I told you leaving the Pride Lands would be dangerous.

882
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,200
What is he gonna say?

883
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,040
Everything the sun touches is ours.

884
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,520
And you try to drag Zazu along with you?

885
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,060
I'm sorry, Dad.

886
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,560
I just thought it'd be fun.

887
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,300
It's only the jungle.

888
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,650
Simba...

889
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,770
You're too...

890
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,230
You're too young.

891
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,810
And someday, you will be king.

892
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:26,950
That is a very big responsibility, requiring you to be responsible.

893
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,290
I know, Dad.

894
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,250
I'm really sorry.

895
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,470
Well, I'm glad I caught you before anyone was hurt.

896
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,730
Now we're going home.

897
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,310
Sorry, we can't show you the jungle.

898
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,610
I bet it's really cool.

899
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,070
We can't show them, but maybe they can tell us what it's like.

900
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,850
What do you... Oh my God, they talk so much.

901
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,910
It's already the sun's out already.

902
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,250
Think about it.

903
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,150
They're not forbidden from leaving the Pride Lands.

904
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,030
They can go there and tell us about it.

905
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,270
Oh yeah!

906
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,210
Then we'll see how fun it'll be when we get there.

907
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,570
Of course, that'll be a long time when we're grown.

908
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,150
Then it's a plan.

909
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,830
Will you go to the jungle on a scouting mission for us?

910
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:10,810
You will?

911
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,630
Awesome!

912
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,490
We already went to the jungle.

913
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,570
Let's do it again.

914
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,450
Let me show you something.

915
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,230
Come over here.

916
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,030
Okay.

917
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,010
Come over here.

918
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:47,910
Follow me.

919
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,450
Simba, follow me.

920
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,530
Oh, we gotta get the other three gems.

921
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,530
Collect two gems before they disappear again.

922
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,210
The baobab tree.

923
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,730
Oh, is this where Rafiki lives?

924
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,590
Oh my God, this is a tall-ass fucking tree.

925
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,450
Oh, there he is!

926
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,510
The weather is very particular, don't you think?

927
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,070
Peculiar.

928
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,510
Wait, he said something else.

929
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:19,730
What did he say?

930
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,410
I tried to...

931
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,010
Something else popped up.

932
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,830
Did you guys see it?

933
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,390
Okay, we talked to him.

934
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,130
No, it didn't show up again after.

935
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,330
Maybe I clicked on you.

936
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:32,790
No?

937
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,790
I know who you are, but it's... Oh, he knows who we are.

938
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,350
What?

939
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,670
He knows who we are.

940
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,630
Oh, he's dancing!

941
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,570
Watch out, Rafiki!

942
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,510
Watch out!

943
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:49,630
Watch out!

944
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,950
You're gonna get Tetris!

945
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,230
I just want to recreate Mufasa's death.

946
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,750
Maybe that's the end of the story.

947
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,570
If he dies.

948
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,710
We're just gonna see him die?

949
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,050
I thought he was gonna...

950
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,050
I thought someone was gonna grow up.

951
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,170
I mean, we have to go to the jungle.

952
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,730
Yeah, we gotta go to the jungle first.

953
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,530
Let's see if we can recreate his death first.

954
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,150
But usually they, like, disappear.

955
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,610
Let's go to the jungle and see if there's anything over there now.

956
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,150
Where did you go?

957
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,070
Towards the jungle.

958
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,090
Where are you?

959
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:19,770
Where are you?

960
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,590
I'm going to the jungle.

961
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,750
I'm following the pathway.

962
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,210
I see Scar.

963
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,250
I went the other way.

964
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,530
I was in front of Pride Rock.

965
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,890
Oh, okay.

966
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,850
So, I'm going...

967
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,690
I'm looking at my map.

968
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,330
I have a map.

969
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:33,790
You know, we all have that map now.

970
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,350
I don't need a map.

971
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,550
I wonder if we can change the timeline.

972
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,050
Save him?

973
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,350
We can save Mufasa?

974
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,170
Save Mufasa!

975
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,090
We just killed Scar right now.

976
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,050
Where are you?

977
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,050
I'm heading to the jungle.

978
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,590
I'm literally in the jungle.

979
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,490
So am I.

980
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,970
The mighty jungle.

981
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,590
The lion sleeps tonight.

982
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,770
I'm already here.

983
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,630
Me too!

984
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,790
No, you're not.

985
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,150
Yes, I am.

986
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,150
Somebody is a snow poke.

987
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,490
I'm in the jungle.

988
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,570
Yeah, I'm next to them.

989
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,270
I don't think we need to talk to them again.

990
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,390
Yes, we do.

991
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,710
It's literally on the map.

992
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,570
It is?

993
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,870
Wait, is it?

994
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,130
Oh wait, no, you're right.

995
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:26,890
Quest log.

996
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,470
What's the point of going here?

997
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,510
Wait, let's see.

998
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,670
I don't think there is anything else we need to do.

999
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,470
Ok, we have to find all the wild gems.

1000
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,590
Yeah, these are collectibles.

1001
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,070
Yeah, but then why the fuck did...

1002
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,430
I'm eating my book right now.

1003
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,230
Can you see?

1004
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,830
Who needs a ring?

1005
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,110
Ring is for losers.

1006
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,870
Yeah, for nerds.

1007
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,870
We ain't no nerds.

1008
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,150
Do we just have to talk to them again?

1009
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:08,110
Talk to Simba again?

1010
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:09,970
Simba, hurry up.

1011
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,070
We want to kill your dad.

1012
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,350
What if we already did everything we need to do?

1013
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,690
Except we have to find the collectibles and stuff.

1014
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,790
There's no way Simba is supposed to grow up.

1015
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,030
I'm pretty sure he's supposed to grow up.

1016
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,490
We've explored the jungle.

1017
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,850
No, we haven't actually.

1018
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,590
We gotta find the hidden hyenas.

1019
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,350
Oh my god, this is kind of crazy.

1020
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,330
I'm talking to Simba.

1021
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,070
Oh no, there's a stuck zebra.

1022
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,350
There's a zebra.

1023
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,710
I'm talking to them.

1024
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:38,890
Let him die.

1025
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:39,870
It's the circle of life.

1026
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:40,530
Ok.

1027
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:44,590
It also keeps going on about Nala and I being betrothed.

1028
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,430
I can't marry her.

1029
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,470
She's my best friend.

1030
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,130
Yeah, I said that earlier.

1031
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,670
Yeah.

1032
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,490
Wait, what the fuck?

1033
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,350
Is that not the jungle that we went through?

1034
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,030
That has to be the jungle, right?

1035
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,650
It is, but I think there's way more of the jungle.

1036
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,190
I'm already...

1037
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,950
I've explored all the jungle already.

1038
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,390
Oh my god, all of it?

1039
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,990
I hear the wild whispers of a dazzling leap.

1040
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:13,950
I'm in the jungle.

1041
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,910
Whispers of a leap?

1042
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,290
What the hell are you talking about?

1043
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,550
Do you think if we do the minigame again, it unlocks the jungle?

1044
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,110
Oh, maybe.

1045
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,570
Wait, hold on before you do.

1046
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,290
How do I do this?

1047
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,690
I'm in the jungle too.

1048
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,030
Oh, I'm in the...

1049
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,530
Wait, where's the famous water area for the jungle?

1050
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,570
Oh, I found a famous tree!

1051
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,890
What famous?

1052
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,390
Are you in the famous Lion King tree?

1053
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,150
There's no famous tree.

1054
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,490
No, if you don't know, Hakuna Matata was...

1055
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,650
Oh my god, you're in the gorge.

1056
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:56,390
Do you need me to start the game so you can get out of there?

1057
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,490
I don't know how to get out of here.

1058
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,950
I don't know how to use the power-ups.

1059
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,610
Use your wand!

1060
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,430
Wait, really?

1061
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,170
Wait, no, I think that takes you out.

1062
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:12,090
Wait, if you left-click it though, you get other stuff.

1063
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,090
Oh.

1064
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,430
Wait, no you don't.

1065
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,370
It teleports to the mini-game.

1066
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,130
Wait, it's the jungle!

1067
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,330
I teleported to the jungle!

1068
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,710
Oh, I can do that too!

1069
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,870
Yeah, use your magic wand!

1070
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,130
Alright, let's catch some grub.

1071
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,650
Alright, we got this.

1072
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,790
We're so much better now.

1073
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,270
Right-click, right-click.

1074
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:35,890
Interact with them.

1075
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,530
Alright, we're better than them.

1076
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,750
Yeah, that's mine.

1077
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,790
That's mine.

1078
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,110
That's mine.

1079
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,690
Oh, I got Minecraft music again.

1080
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,710
No, no, no!

1081
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:47,230
Bitch!

1082
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,570
We're a team, what do you mean bitch?

1083
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,810
I wasn't talking to you!

1084
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,670
I was talking to actual Pumba!

1085
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,270
I am actual Pumba, what do you mean?

1086
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,850
I am him.

1087
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,010
Oh no, he took...

1088
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,470
Oh, there's a beetle.

1089
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,870
That's right, we're faster than you.

1090
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,850
I'm getting so many points.

1091
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,410
Me too, we have 60...

1092
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,890
Oh my god, we're 65, we're literally gonna starve to death.

1093
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,470
We are sweeping, we are sweeping.

1094
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:14,290
No, Pumba!

1095
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,710
Three times a charm.

1096
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,370
They're gonna starve.

1097
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:22,270
We're gonna eliminate the entire bug population.

1098
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,610
Yeah, they'll have nothing.

1099
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,310
They'll have nothing.

1100
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,610
Come on, let me get that one.

1101
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,790
Slimy yet satisfying.

1102
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,010
Oh my god, we're at 103!

1103
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,610
Alright, we did it.

1104
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,830
We've explored the jungle.

1105
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,570
We got outgrubbed by the rookie.

1106
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,810
That's right!

1107
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,170
Get outgrubbed!

1108
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,950
Yeah, this is what I have to say about that.

1109
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,170
Transformers, roll out.

1110
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,770
You become the size of Timon when you do that.

1111
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,810
Final boss, roll out.

1112
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,190
Well, that didn't do anything.

1113
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,750
Wait, follow me though, follow me.

1114
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,090
Oh, I'm following you?

1115
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,510
Oh wait, do you wanna go talk to them?

1116
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,550
And I'll try and get the other stuff in the jungle.

1117
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,510
No, you just TP.

1118
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,810
No, there's more back here.

1119
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,490
There's more back here?

1120
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,970
Yeah, why do you think I fell into the gorge?

1121
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,150
But what does that mean?

1122
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:30,090
It's not gonna progress the story.

1123
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,450
I don't know, let me go talk to them.

1124
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,030
Oh see, it's the famous bridge.

1125
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,710
It's the Lion King bridge.

1126
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,150
Oh, this is when they go...

1127
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,750
No, it's Hakuna Matata.

1128
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,510
Wait, you wanna see something really dramatic?

1129
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:49,330
Yeah.

1130
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:51,270
No!

1131
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:54,390
Simba.

1132
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,410
Remember who you are.

1133
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,670
Wait, can I die in here?

1134
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,210
I wonder.

1135
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,370
I'm gonna try and drown myself.

1136
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,090
You're gonna drown?

1137
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,330
Let's see what happens.

1138
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,730
Remember who you are.

1139
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,650
Wait, before we die.

1140
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,170
I'm dying and I'm...

1141
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,690
I'm dying while I emote.

1142
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,790
Wait, I'm healing at the same time though.

1143
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,150
Oh, you're right.

1144
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:31,710
Oh, I think we're on...

1145
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,150
No, no, we can out-damage them.

1146
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:37,170
I died!

1147
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:41,130
Oh!

1148
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,970
We're back at the jungle.

1149
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,330
Oh, we're back in the jungle.

1150
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:46,290
Hello.

1151
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:47,670
Back home.

1152
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,810
I don't wanna live here.

1153
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,270
It's not my home.

1154
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,310
I don't understand.

1155
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,550
Why won't it let us get out?

1156
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,910
Wait, there's more to the jungle.

1157
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:58,370
That's weird.

1158
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,530
Have you been listening to anything I've been saying?

1159
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,350
And look, there's the famous Lion King bridge.

1160
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,490
Oh, I'm a fucking groundhog today.

1161
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,090
Yeah, we're restarting today because we died.

1162
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,210
I'm like going deep in the jungle.

1163
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:28,630
I think I don't wanna live in Pride Rock anymore.

1164
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:32,690
Wait, I'm hitting the invisible wall though!

1165
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:33,910
No!

1166
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,090
I don't understand.

1167
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,990
Oh, is it because we talked to Timon and Pumbaa too fast?

1168
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:44,230
The game was like, you're not supposed to talk to them yet.

1169
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,470
Is this the jungle?

1170
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:48,290
No, go talk to...

1171
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:49,430
Wait, there's a black zebra!

1172
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,410
Oh, it's just a gazelle.

1173
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,770
Wait, aren't zebras originally black with white stripes?

1174
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:03,430
I don't remember.

1175
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:12,350
They shade the zebra and the white stripes are the fur.

1176
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,210
Why are you laughing?

1177
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,010
It's true!

1178
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:17,730
What?

1179
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:18,810
It's true!

1180
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,310
They are!

1181
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,210
Why are you laughing?

1182
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,130
Wait, I'm stuck behind an invisible wall.

1183
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,590
I think I'm trapped for real.

1184
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:34,810
Just use your magic wand.

1185
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,850
Okay, I'm out.

1186
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,310
Are you gonna go talk to...

1187
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,590
Yeah, I'll talk to them again.

1188
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:41,930
I think we broke the game.

1189
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,170
I think we're never gonna see Mufasa die.

1190
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:44,370
What?

1191
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,550
They don't think children will sequence break?

1192
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:47,470
Like, come on.

1193
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,790
We'll never see Mufasa die.

1194
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,450
That's fine.

1195
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,170
It's literally the only thing I asked for.

1196
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,250
That's okay.

1197
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,430
I always wanted a brother.

1198
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,570
Just like you.

1199
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:06,690
No!

1200
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,370
It's because we sequence break!

1201
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:10,490
Wait, seriously?

1202
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,770
I think so.

1203
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,290
We're never gonna see Mufasa die.

1204
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,210
I don't think they probably have him die.

1205
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,430
I'm pretty sure we could have seen him die.

1206
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,750
Like, why would he?

1207
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,310
Why would he let you?

1208
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,790
He would like dissolve into little Minecraft dust particles.

1209
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,170
You know like the...

1210
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,130
Minecraft story where the pig just...

1211
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,170
What?

1212
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,470
Have you ever seen a Minecraft...

1213
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,610
Infamous Minecraft story from Telltale's game?

1214
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,130
Where like the pig...

1215
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,950
It was like an emotional moment and then the pig just fucking dies.

1216
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,250
And turns into pork.

1217
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,270
Wait, you've never seen that video?

1218
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:44,450
Okay, wait.

1219
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,110
I'm gonna kidnap a hyena real quick.

1220
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,350
Oh, where'd you find one?

1221
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,970
I'm in the hyena territory.

1222
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:51,790
You know like...

1223
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,870
The light doesn't touch us, don't go there.

1224
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,190
Wait guys, how do you use this?

1225
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:56,730
Do you know?

1226
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,050
I can't believe you've never seen that video before.

1227
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:01,930
It's so good.

1228
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,530
I don't consume Minecraft content.

1229
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,410
I'm kidnapping this hyena.

1230
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,350
You're mine now.

1231
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,150
Wait, what the fuck is this?

1232
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,450
Why would the compass work?

1233
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:12,230
Oh!

1234
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:14,830
I found another thing.

1235
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,010
Oh my god, I found the hyenas!

1236
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,390
I found where they live.

1237
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,210
It's an ability you don't have yet.

1238
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,090
Oh, oh!

1239
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,130
The hyena doesn't want to talk to me.

1240
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,530
She's too good for me.

1241
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,510
Oh, they're all like...

1242
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,530
There's this ability we don't have yet.

1243
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,330
I'm gonna send you the...

1244
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,990
Oh, am I out of the game?

1245
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,590
Did your game crash?

1246
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:44,790
No, I remember what I said every time I tabbed out.

1247
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:46,450
Oh my god.

1248
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:47,310
I see.

1249
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,710
Okay, okay, okay.

1250
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,310
I'm in the dressing room so I can show you.

1251
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:53,910
Minecraft story pig.

1252
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,530
I can't believe you've never seen this before.

1253
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,870
Minecraft story pig.

1254
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,370
Minecraft story pig.

1255
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,050
Minecraft story pig.

1256
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,610
Minecraft story pig.

1257
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:10,710
It's so good.

1258
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,410
It better be.

1259
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,550
It better be really, really good.

1260
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:15,510
It's actually...

1261
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,610
It's so good.

1262
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:20,370
It's one of the best scenes ever.

1263
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:21,550
I'm kidnapping a hyena.

1264
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,370
Are you kidnapping a hyena?

1265
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:26,250
Oh my god, why is it four minutes long?

1266
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,050
Why?

1267
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,290
It's four minutes long!

1268
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,110
We only have two more hyenas to kidnap.

1269
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,990
Okay, I need to find...

1270
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,830
I need to find the shortest video.

1271
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,890
I can't...

1272
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:39,970
Let's do Markiplier React.

1273
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:40,250
Yeah.

1274
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,490
Markiplier React.

1275
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,270
I'm gonna kidnap another hyena.

1276
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,530
What the hell is that?

1277
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,030
Are you in the realm?

1278
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:57,790
Oh my god.

1279
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:58,630
God damn it.

1280
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:00,650
Okay, I'm back in.

1281
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:03,870
Where are you?

1282
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,530
I'm in the realm.

1283
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,250
I'm with the hyenas.

1284
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:07,930
Me too.

1285
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,390
I just saw you.

1286
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:11,350
Wait, you're Steve again?

1287
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:13,690
God damn it.

1288
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:14,590
Don't worry.

1289
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,430
I'll be Sans.

1290
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:20,010
And then...

1291
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,610
Yeah, you're Sans.

1292
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,230
And then I'll be...

1293
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:27,530
Oh wait, there's hyenas we can talk to down here.

1294
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,910
No, they don't talk to you.

1295
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:29,830
They don't acknowledge you.

1296
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:32,490
Bastard.

1297
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,270
You don't...

1298
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:34,930
Hello?

1299
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,850
Well, well, Banzai.

1300
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,050
What have we got here?

1301
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,630
I don't know, Shenzi.

1302
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,730
But I'd say it's trespassers.

1303
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,130
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

1304
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,450
We'd love you to stick around for dinner.

1305
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,130
Yeah, maybe we could get those...

1306
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,310
Well, you know...

1307
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:52,950
Maybe you need to be more personable.

1308
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:54,470
Oh my god.

1309
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:55,550
I'm Pumbaa.

1310
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,630
How much more personable can I be?

1311
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,430
I'm rizzing them.

1312
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,170
Maybe we could get those little lion cubs we saw to join us.

1313
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:04,990
Except they're lying around.

1314
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:06,810
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1315
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:07,750
I got one, I got one.

1316
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,630
Make mine a cub sandwich.

1317
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:11,810
What do you think?

1318
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,890
I think I'm hungry.

1319
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,210
All this talk of food has me starving.

1320
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,350
Oh, me too.

1321
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,210
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1322
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:21,310
Dinner!

1323
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:24,190
Is that it?

1324
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:25,710
That's all they say?

1325
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,290
Ed doesn't say anything.

1326
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,470
That's not fair.

1327
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:31,010
Oh, wait.

1328
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,550
Oh, I just had to talk to her.

1329
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:33,890
And then she talked.

1330
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,830
You're Steve again.

1331
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:36,330
I'm Steve again?

1332
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,850
Yeah, I got kicked out.

1333
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,350
Yeah, I tabbed out.

1334
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,530
Guys, now I know why people don't play bedrock.

1335
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,430
Ed doesn't do anything for me.

1336
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:48,910
Alright, you know what?

1337
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:49,930
Wait, should we do...

1338
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,310
Let's try to go creative mode.

1339
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:52,490
How do you do that?

1340
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,270
Return to the hub.

1341
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,370
What's the mode?

1342
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,290
Create a mode.

1343
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:02,490
No, I think I remember when you make this...

1344
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,350
It doesn't allow you to add cheats.

1345
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,010
Wait, really?

1346
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:07,130
Yeah, because I tried to add them.

1347
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:09,790
No, wait.

1348
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,050
Oh, I can.

1349
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,490
Oh, you can?

1350
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,710
I have to be the operator, right?

1351
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:16,130
What is it?

1352
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:17,450
Mode...

1353
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,190
Game mode...

1354
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:21,530
Game mode...

1355
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,130
Game mode...

1356
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,410
I don't know how it is on bedrock.

1357
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:28,570
Wait, what is it?

1358
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:29,890
Slash game mode.

1359
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:31,850
Cheats are allowed.

1360
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:32,290
No!

1361
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,270
Wait, I should be allowed to...

1362
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:37,790
I think Disney is like...

1363
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:40,410
Disney is like, no, no, no, you aren't gonna cheat.

1364
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,190
No, no, no.

1365
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,170
Why are you cheating?

1366
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,670
No, no, no.

1367
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:45,390
No, no.

1368
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,450
You know what?

1369
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,230
I'm gonna...

1370
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,790
I'm gonna teleport to...

1371
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:52,770
I'm gonna go to...

1372
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,650
Cheats are fine and played on me.

1373
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,630
Wait, I'm back in the hub.

1374
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,430
Where did you go?

1375
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,050
I'm in Lion King.

1376
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:00,770
You're still there?

1377
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,870
Yeah.

1378
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:04,870
I'm here now.

1379
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:05,990
Ok, I'll leave.

1380
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,310
Is there nothing else to do here?

1381
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,250
Oh wait, I can activate cheats?

1382
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:11,730
How?

1383
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,290
Wait, I think if we go into sandbox mode, maybe?

1384
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,050
Wait, ok.

1385
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:17,670
Oh, I activated friendly fire.

1386
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:18,890
Oh, you did?

1387
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,950
Wait, I found the last Aida!

1388
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:22,990
I activated cheats.

1389
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,030
Ok, uh...

1390
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,890
Game mode...

1391
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,190
Creative...

1392
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:32,630
Your game mode has been successfully updated.

1393
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:33,210
I'm flying.

1394
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:33,790
What?

1395
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:34,890
How do you do it?

1396
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,890
In the jungle, the mighty jungle...

1397
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,210
A lion sleeps tonight.

1398
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,250
Where are you?

1399
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,970
In the jungle...

1400
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,390
The mighty...

1401
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,990
Remember who you are...

1402
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,710
Where are you?

1403
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,570
Are you looking at me?

1404
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:56,350
Oh wait, I see you.

1405
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,890
Remember who you are...

1406
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,830
Ok, game mode...

1407
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,270
I'm gonna give you...

1408
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,330
Let's see if I can give you...

1409
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,670
Wait, where are you though?

1410
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,110
Just go down.

1411
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,030
Where are you?

1412
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,290
I don't see you.

1413
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:20,930
Turn around.

1414
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:23,990
In the jungle...

1415
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,090
I can't hurt you!

1416
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:36,690
Yes!

1417
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:36,950
Yes!

1418
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:37,630
Wait,

1419
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:44,130
what happened?

1420
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:45,470
Where did you go?

1421
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,550
Wait, no, I'm still in the jungle.

1422
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,090
Where did you...

1423
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,290
We're trying to kill Mufasa.

1424
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:00,550
Wait, can you?

1425
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,710
I'll kill him now.

1426
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:07,950
Wait...

1427
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,230
Can you push him?

1428
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,270
No, I'm doing something better.

1429
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:15,690
In the jungle...

1430
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,870
Long live the...

1431
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:23,350
Look, he's begging for it.

1432
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:29,430
He's breaking his neck to get it.

1433
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:35,410
Long live the king...

1434
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:36,390
Do it already!

1435
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,950
Oh my god, he's...

1436
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:42,450
He's invincible!

1437
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:47,270
Wait, with this we might actually be able to push him to the...

1438
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:53,330
To the gorge and then we can have him actually fall down and die.

1439
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,830
Oh yeah, I definitely can get hurt from that.

1440
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,930
How do we push him?

1441
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,250
With the water.

1442
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,570
Oh, with the water?

1443
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,270
Ok, we gotta make a tunnel to it.

1444
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,550
Where's the gorge?

1445
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,770
It's over this way, I think.

1446
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:15,230
Put him in a boat.

1447
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:16,430
Oh yeah, a boat!

1448
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,910
Can he like...

1449
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,130
Ok, let me get the boat.

1450
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,570
Mufasa, we're gonna recreate history.

1451
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,370
It's not over there, something's glowing.

1452
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,430
What is that, guys?

1453
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:29,410
It's not glowing.

1454
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:30,950
Oh my god, it's on the boat!

1455
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,030
Wait, wait, wait.

1456
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:36,410
Get rid of the...

1457
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:38,070
What the heck?

1458
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,610
Oh my god, I gotta get rid of this lava.

1459
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,650
Use the bucket, use the bucket.

1460
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,410
Oh, this is what this thing...

1461
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,830
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1462
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,730
I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

1463
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,250
Wait, wait, no, no, no.

1464
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,130
Stop, stop!

1465
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,010
Where did you go?

1466
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,950
Oh god, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

1467
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,090
Use your magic wand, use your magic wand.

1468
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,730
I'm trying not to use it.

1469
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:03,650
Ok, I'm fine.

1470
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,370
Are you ok?

1471
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:06,370
I don't think you're fine.

1472
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:08,690
I'm fine, everything's good.

1473
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,090
Alright, I'm ok too.

1474
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,330
Get in the boat, Mufasa.

1475
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:16,990
Get in the boat.

1476
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,470
Oh my god, I think I fucked it up.

1477
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:21,390
No, use water to push him in.

1478
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:24,070
He's not getting on the boat, look at all the boats I have.

1479
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:25,350
He's not getting in.

1480
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:28,570
He's in, he's in, he's in, he's in!

1481
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,490
And all it took was for me to show up.

1482
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,330
Wait, can I get in the boat?

1483
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:37,910
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

1484
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,660
Come on Mufasa!

1485
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:52,820
Let's go!

1486
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,280
Let's go Mufasa, let's go!

1487
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,840
Come on Mufasa, we're going to the gorge!

1488
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,800
Come on Mufasa!

1489
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,040
Let's go!

1490
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,040
We've kidnapped the king!

1491
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,780
We're gonna finish the job.

1492
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,580
Do something Scar can never do.

1493
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,720
Should we bring Scar?

1494
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,220
No, he's too far I think.

1495
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,500
We might bring Simba.

1496
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,760
To watch his dad die.

1497
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,160
Watch your dad die Simba, it's time.

1498
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,880
Wait, I wanna be a pyre.

1499
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,560
Don't worry, I'm coming over too.

1500
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,100
How can we get him up to the top of the gorge?

1501
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,040
Oh the water, I can bring water over.

1502
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,980
Oh yeah, bring some water and I'll float up it.

1503
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,060
Okay, okay.

1504
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,920
Alright, here we go.

1505
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,040
It's like in my face.

1506
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,060
Don't worry, I'm bringing Simba too.

1507
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,180
Simba.

1508
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,340
I see you very slowly.

1509
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,320
Wait, I can leash the boat.

1510
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,040
Wait, I can?

1511
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:07,500
Leash.

1512
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,800
Wait, can I actually?

1513
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,160
Simba.

1514
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,880
Can I leash you up?

1515
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,720
Oh, but you went inside one of these paths.

1516
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,660
You can't go in here.

1517
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,740
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1518
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,460
It's time.

1519
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:23,820
You row, I pour water.

1520
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:25,780
Okay.

1521
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,100
Okay.

1522
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:29,960
Oh, okay, there we go.

1523
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,180
Wait, let's try the leash now.

1524
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:32,740
Maybe it'll work.

1525
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,880
Okay, maybe, yeah.

1526
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,080
Does it work?

1527
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,740
How do I leash him?

1528
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,560
I think you leash the boat.

1529
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,580
I don't think it works.

1530
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,480
No, no, no, no.

1531
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,580
You row, I water.

1532
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:47,680
Okay, okay.

1533
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,580
Wait, I want to go up higher.

1534
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,580
It's time to watch your dad die, Simba.

1535
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,620
Go to the top of that hill.

1536
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:04,840
Up here.

1537
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,340
And let the water run down.

1538
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,840
And see if we can get up here.

1539
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,320
Here?

1540
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1541
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,360
Alright, come on, Mufasa.

1542
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,760
Let's try going up.

1543
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,880
Uh-oh.

1544
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,720
Oh, no, Mufasa!

1545
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,320
Mufasa!

1546
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,080
Mufasa, too soon!

1547
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,140
Too soon, Mufasa!

1548
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,340
Stop!

1549
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:39,900
Stop sending water!

1550
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:41,440
Stop sending water!

1551
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,320
No,

1552
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,880
Mufasa, no!

1553
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,560
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

1554
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,520
I want him to fall from the absolute tallest spot.

1555
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,280
I'm trying!

1556
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:01,320
I'm trying!

1557
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,400
No more water!

1558
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,400
No more water.

1559
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,580
Okay, here we go, here we go.

1560
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,960
Oh gosh, I was so close.

1561
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,060
At least it didn't work, you guys.

1562
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,460
I'm close, I'm close, I'm close.

1563
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,900
Is he still with me?

1564
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:24,260
No.

1565
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,560
Get rid of some of the water!

1566
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,020
Get rid of some of the water!

1567
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1568
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,060
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

1569
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,280
Why am I going down with him?

1570
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,850
You see that, Simba?

1571
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,610
You see that?

1572
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,330
You see that, Simba?

1573
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:38,570
Remember these faces, Timon and Pumbaa, who killed your dad!

1574
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:42,250
We killed your dad, so now you can be your gay husband!

1575
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:43,190
Oh my god!

1576
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:47,210
Someone just said try TNT on...

1577
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:47,610
What?

1578
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:55,030
That's right, we killed your dad so we can adopt you.

1579
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:57,790
That's right.

1580
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,710
Get the TNT, get the TNT and blow him up.

1581
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:03,030
Goodbye, Mufasa.

1582
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:09,070
He looks like so desperate with his big teeth.

1583
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:10,350
He looks like such a bozo.

1584
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,930
I'm done saving you, Mufasa.

1585
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:17,330
No!

1586
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:29,250
Wait, wait, wait, can I go to the other side?

1587
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:30,710
Hold on, I want to save him from the tower.

1588
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:31,510
Pure cinema?

1589
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:32,990
Yeah, pure cinema.

1590
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:36,310
Alright, we'll know now.

1591
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,370
I'll tell you when I'm there.

1592
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:39,250
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1593
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:40,150
Let me get to the top.

1594
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,250
I'm slow, I'm slow.

1595
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:45,110
It's all the water, it's all the water.

1596
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:46,850
It's all the water.

1597
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:52,710
This movie is different from what I remember.

1598
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,250
Okay.

1599
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,070
Doing what Scar couldn't.

1600
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:58,670
Okay.

1601
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:01,470
Light her up.

1602
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:03,110
I lit it up.

1603
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,250
He lives!

1604
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,430
He lives!

1605
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:11,730
Oh my god, he lives!

1606
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,970
I thought it would like shoot him up into the air.

1607
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:16,990
Yeah, me too, I thought so too.

1608
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:20,210
Oh my god.

1609
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:21,270
Well, that was great.

1610
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,650
It was great visiting Lion King.

1611
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:24,190
Yeah.

1612
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,050
Oh, shit.

1613
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:29,990
Wait, there's water.

1614
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,010
There's water.

1615
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:32,410
Wait, where's the water?

1616
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,430
I'm pruning Africa down.

1617
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,570
Goodbye, players.

1618
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:40,950
Goodbye, players.

1619
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:44,710
Oh my god, they're just walking right through it.

1620
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:46,970
Goodbye.

1621
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:49,410
Wait, these aren't even real trees.

1622
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,710
They don't even light up.

1623
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:55,610
Wait, they're not even real trees.

1624
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:56,670
Where are we?

1625
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:59,370
Oh yeah, this is apparently a dream.

1626
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:00,710
This is Disney magic.

1627
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:01,490
That's what it is.

1628
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,570
We're in Simba's nightmare right now.

1629
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:13,590
This is what he plays except when he remembers his dad dying, but it also includes fire all around.

1630
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,890
Fire and Timon and Pumba.

1631
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:21,770
Wait, I can reset the world so we can do creative one versus the other ones.

1632
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:22,250
Okay.

1633
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:24,390
Alright, let me reset the world.

1634
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:26,290
It's like nothing happened.

1635
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,770
It's like we didn't terrorize the planes.

1636
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,810
Yeah, we're in the Truman Show.

1637
01:05:39,630 --> 01:05:40,630
I'll reset the world.

1638
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,030
I'll reset it.

1639
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,010
Are you enjoying Minecraft?

1640
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,810
Wait, so like, leave, leave?

1641
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,090
Yeah, leave, leave and I'll reset it.

1642
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:52,990
Let's see, how do I destroy this?

1643
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,930
Okay, manage realm.

1644
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,470
Oh my god, we have to wait.

1645
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:02,210
Guys, this is my first time going through this.

1646
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,070
Yeah, this is Kingdom Hearts 4.

1647
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:10,890
Alright, let's see.

1648
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:17,390
How do I destroy this world as if nothing happened?

1649
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,930
As if we didn't kill everything.

1650
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:23,410
Wait, can you just make a new realm?

1651
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:25,010
Yeah, I could, yeah.

1652
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,050
I want to destroy this realm though.

1653
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:29,590
I don't want this realm anymore.

1654
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,290
Oh wait, it's here!

1655
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,870
You discovered the Badlands.

1656
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:37,290
I assumed that was...

1657
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:39,490
I assumed that one was like...

1658
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:40,570
Yeah, that one's our realm.

1659
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:41,630
How do I destroy you?

1660
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,870
I want to destroy.

1661
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:45,810
Edit world.

1662
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:47,550
Fetching realm.

1663
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:50,370
Uh...

1664
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,210
Oh, I can restore the world!

1665
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:55,690
To what it was like.

1666
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:56,850
I don't want to restore.

1667
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:57,990
I want to destroy it.

1668
01:06:59,290 --> 01:06:59,970
Fetching realm.

1669
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:00,370
Do something!

1670
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:03,450
I'm trying to figure it out!

1671
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:07,130
Why doesn't it let me destroy you?

1672
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,450
Okay, creating new.

1673
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:12,110
Okay, play on realms.

1674
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:13,450
Uh...

1675
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:13,750
Here.

1676
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:15,930
I did it.

1677
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:18,350
I'm destroying the realm as if it never happened.

1678
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,090
What we did...

1679
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:22,250
It's like we never terrorized this area.

1680
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:22,950
Delete the VOD.

1681
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,970
Yeah, we didn't try to kill Mufasa.

1682
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:27,090
We didn't.

1683
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,430
I'm gonna change.

1684
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:35,070
No one will know my crime.

1685
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,390
I'm a solid creeper.

1686
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:42,270
No one will know my crime.

1687
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:45,650
I don't know why I have these.

1688
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:48,290
I didn't buy them, so I don't know why I have them.

1689
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:49,670
Oh, solid creeper?

1690
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,930
Yeah, I recreated it.

1691
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:53,050
Alright.

1692
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:53,430
Oh, you did?

1693
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,930
Yeah, yeah.

1694
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:57,970
Add realm members.

1695
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,070
Invite.

1696
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:01,450
Did you get it?

1697
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:02,870
Let me see.

1698
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:05,750
Alright.

1699
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:08,690
It's like...

1700
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,270
We didn't destroy this realm.

1701
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:13,050
Wait, I love...

1702
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,010
I'm gonna be a new skin.

1703
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:20,850
You're gonna be a new skin?

1704
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:24,990
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

1705
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:26,930
It is with great pride.

1706
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,890
Do the Tetris.

1707
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:29,770
Do the Tetris.

1708
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:41,910
It's like...

1709
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:46,090
I wanna be Disney too.

1710
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:47,230
Let's see.

1711
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:49,930
It is with great pleasure.

1712
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,970
Oh, wait, I can change the set.

1713
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:53,930
Wait, let me add...

1714
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,050
What is it?

1715
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:56,150
Friendly fire.

1716
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:58,730
Okay.

1717
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,370
Oh, did I not save it?

1718
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:03,630
Do you see me?

1719
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:04,430
Friendly fire.

1720
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:10,790
Beast!

1721
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,310
Oh my god, it's a beast!

1722
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,370
Unlock all worlds, alright.

1723
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:17,090
Unlock all worlds.

1724
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,710
Oh my god.

1725
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,550
Oh my god, she's going beast mode!

1726
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:26,080
What just happened?

1727
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,680
Oh my god, we unlocked everything.

1728
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:29,640
Aladdin!

1729
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,360
This is the record book.

1730
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:41,300
Do you have that successfully executed six function entries?

1731
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:42,260
No.

1732
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:45,560
Why does it show up on my side?

1733
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,560
Oh my god, what does that mean?

1734
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,620
What does that mean?

1735
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,080
This is a successfully...

1736
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,320
Where does it show up?

1737
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,200
On my chat.

1738
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,300
I thought it was cause like...

1739
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,340
Oh, function six is clocking someone in the face?

1740
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,980
Oh, it's cause I hit you.

1741
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,060
That's why I have it.

1742
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:08,000
You hit me, I hit you too much.

1743
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,080
Wait, how do you...

1744
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,880
Oh, I have all the game info on?

1745
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,960
How do I turn that off?

1746
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,720
Wait, they're not all unlocked?

1747
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,400
Wait, but they are.

1748
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,560
But they are not.

1749
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:25,380
That's weird.

1750
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:26,660
They should be.

1751
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,300
Yes.

1752
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,160
Oh shit, sorry.

1753
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,060
Where are we?

1754
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,220
Where are we?

1755
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,420
Oh, we're in Snow White!

1756
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:36,920
The beast!

1757
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,520
Oh my god, it's Gaston!

1758
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,100
Oh, game.

1759
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,760
Oh, it's cause I had this.

1760
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,200
Game rule.

1761
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:53,040
It's cause I had that.

1762
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,480
Oh my god, what did I do?

1763
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:02,440
There goes the beast ravaging the village.

1764
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,260
Oh my god.

1765
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:08,460
Every morning it's the same.

1766
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,620
It's the morning that she came.

1767
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,180
Poor girl Belle.

1768
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,080
Oh my god.

1769
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,300
I broke my game.

1770
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,420
What did you do?

1771
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,340
I broke my game.

1772
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,160
I'm trying to fix my game right now.

1773
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:29,780
No!

1774
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:30,760
Stop!

1775
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,620
I broke my game!

1776
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,160
If you die, you might be back to normal.

1777
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,360
No!

1778
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,960
That's not how it works!

1779
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:38,780
No!

1780
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,460
I broke my game!

1781
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:43,080
Lumiere!

1782
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:43,880
Lumiere!

1783
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:44,640
Lumiere!

1784
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:47,200
No!

1785
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:49,500
Stop!

1786
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,280
Are you dying at all?

1787
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,440
No, I don't know.

1788
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,800
I'm trying to fix my game.

1789
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:55,820
Right now!

1790
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,940
No, I still can't get out.

1791
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,740
Somebody fix my chat!

1792
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:05,540
What are you talking about?

1793
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,000
My chat!

1794
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,500
It's broken!

1795
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,020
Somebody fix my chat!

1796
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,800
All I see is the game rules!

1797
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:23,020
Oh my god.

1798
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,440
What did I do?

1799
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,180
How did this happen to me?

1800
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,460
I'm going to kill you!

1801
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,640
Don't worry!

1802
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,420
I'm going to kill you!

1803
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:34,860
Don't worry!

1804
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,480
You'll die!

1805
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,680
You'll die and then you'll be reborn!

1806
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:38,420
It's fine!

1807
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,460
Don't worry!

1808
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:41,200
I'll kill you!

1809
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,080
Did it work?

1810
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:48,620
Did it work?

1811
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,760
You saw nothing.

1812
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,380
No!

1813
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,240
The beast!

1814
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,540
It didn't work.

1815
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,280
I don't know what's going on.

1816
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,660
All I see is my chat.

1817
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,180
My chat commands.

1818
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,220
That's all I see.

1819
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,240
Did you try escape?

1820
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,680
Did I try escape?

1821
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,280
There you are.

1822
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:12,240
You look capable.

1823
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,320
Join me.

1824
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,240
We're going to storm the castle and slay the hideous beast.

1825
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,820
Did he actually say that?

1826
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:18,220
Yeah!

1827
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:20,580
You're the beast.

1828
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:25,620
So we can rescue the girl who's going to be my wife.

1829
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,080
The most beautiful bell.

1830
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,520
It will be your honor.

1831
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,140
A mighty honor, I'd say.

1832
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,480
Yes, LeFou.

1833
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:34,420
Very mighty.

1834
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,660
Meet me at the edge of the village.

1835
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,140
We'll set out from there.

1836
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:38,800
Onward!

1837
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,400
Onward!

1838
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:41,900
Did we get to kill Gaston?

1839
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,280
Are we going to kill him?

1840
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,720
Bye, Gaston.

1841
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,260
Bye.

1842
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,400
Wait, what if I restart my game?

1843
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,120
Restart your game.

1844
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,580
What I see is like...

1845
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:57,000
I can't see half my screen.

1846
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:57,740
Oh my god.

1847
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,880
She goes again.

1848
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:03,220
I don't know when I broke the game.

1849
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,420
I thought this was blood.

1850
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,940
I thought this was blood spots.

1851
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:15,820
Bonjour!

1852
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,080
Bonjour, bonjour!

1853
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,900
I need six eggs!

1854
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,180
That's too expensive!

1855
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:25,340
It must be more than this provincial life.

1856
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,280
That's why I'm going to make Belle my wife.

1857
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:31,780
That didn't work.

1858
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,900
Oh there's our dad!

1859
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,900
What the fuck was that?

1860
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,380
Maurice!

1861
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,580
Oh there he is.

1862
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:40,140
Oh my god.

1863
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,400
He looks like Goddamn.

1864
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:42,260
Where are you?

1865
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,580
I'm at the edge of the village.

1866
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,380
Oh, I'm heading over there.

1867
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:47,580
He looks like...

1868
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,700
Herobrine over there.

1869
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,600
What?

1870
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,060
I'm gonna go into Belle's rooms and sniff her sheets.

1871
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,620
You're gonna what?

1872
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,360
What are you gonna do?

1873
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,400
Where are you?

1874
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,580
I'm trying to fix my game.

1875
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:06,200
Still?

1876
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,900
I don't understand.

1877
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,740
She's the most beautiful girl.

1878
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:11,480
Bella, you have to.

1879
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:13,980
You only get one chance to do that.

1880
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,840
Can I ride the horse?

1881
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:17,360
Please.

1882
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,900
Please, somebody.

1883
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,260
Freebie!

1884
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:22,960
Freebie!

1885
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:29,020
Here, once you're good, I have a...

1886
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:32,060
I have a ride for us.

1887
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,940
Wait, are you in Belle's house?

1888
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:36,760
Are you in here?

1889
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,000
I'm heading over to Belle's house right now.

1890
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,660
I see Belle's dad.

1891
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,440
Wait, is that Belle's dad?

1892
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,300
Yeah, that's Belle's dad.

1893
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,320
Wait, where are you?

1894
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,480
I do not see you.

1895
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,440
Wait, I got a collectible.

1896
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,100
I do too.

1897
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:50,460
I already got that.

1898
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,360
Wait, where are you?

1899
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,380
I'm right in front of Belle's house.

1900
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,900
Wait, they got another...

1901
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,440
manual for me to travel.

1902
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,460
Why is this so scuffed?

1903
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:04,340
No, you have to see what I have to go through.

1904
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,400
Your game is cursed.

1905
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,320
Wait, I think it's fixed.

1906
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,220
No, it's not.

1907
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,680
I still don't see you.

1908
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,160
No, it's not.

1909
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:15,960
I fixed it!

1910
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:16,960
We

1911
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,990
figured it out.

1912
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:24,090
I'm on a horse right now.

1913
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:24,650
Me too!

1914
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:26,230
Wait, where are you?

1915
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:27,250
Where are you?

1916
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:29,370
I'm in front of Belle's house.

1917
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:31,710
I'm in front of Belle's house too.

1918
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,750
Hello?

1919
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:38,010
Where are you?

1920
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:38,790
You're here.

1921
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:41,610
The beast?

1922
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:43,630
Did you see Belle's dad?

1923
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:45,650
I'm at the village farm.

1924
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:46,890
Sorry, I'm not at her house.

1925
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:49,770
I'm at the village farm.

1926
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:50,690
Oh shit!

1927
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,230
Oh my god, you're so far!

1928
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,470
Where are you?

1929
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:55,550
I'm gonna head over to Belle.

1930
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:57,210
Okay, head over to Belle's dad.

1931
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:59,090
Belle's dad?

1932
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:00,890
Yeah, we gotta go talk to Gaston.

1933
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:02,590
Oh, I see him!

1934
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:05,830
Hello, Steve.

1935
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:06,270
Hello.

1936
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,290
Where am I, Steve?

1937
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:09,430
Yeah.

1938
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:13,450
Don't worry, the sign's gonna be here for a sec.

1939
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:14,190
One sec.

1940
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:16,330
And then...

1941
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:17,710
There we go.

1942
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:18,450
Bonjour.

1943
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:22,710
Bonjour, bonjour, bonjour.

1944
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:24,450
What does Belle's dad say?

1945
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:26,230
I don't know, I didn't talk to him.

1946
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:28,150
Oh no!

1947
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:29,510
How on earth did that happen?

1948
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,670
I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk.

1949
01:17:32,130 --> 01:17:34,270
I'll never get this boneheaded contraption to work.

1950
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:35,970
That's all he says.

1951
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:37,550
What did you change into?

1952
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:40,510
Of course, Lumiere.

1953
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,430
Look, this time we're not gonna sequence break.

1954
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:45,530
So we're gonna experience the story.

1955
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:46,430
I'll be LeFou.

1956
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:46,890
Okay.

1957
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:49,510
Oh, we can't leave just yet.

1958
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,130
First I must go take care of old Maurice.

1959
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:54,110
You go ahead and scout for us.

1960
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:57,610
And then soon I will have Belle for my wife.

1961
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:58,510
Make no mistake.

1962
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,250
Oh, you don't get any lines.

1963
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,210
I don't get lines.

1964
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,410
Just like the real Maurice.

1965
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:04,850
Let's take the horse.

1966
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:08,430
But I can't ride the horse with you.

1967
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:08,990
You can't?

1968
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:10,170
Can I?

1969
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:10,910
No, I can't.

1970
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:11,670
We gotta get another horse.

1971
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,010
There's another horse over there.

1972
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:14,330
I saw another horse that we can steal.

1973
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:17,630
This is the way to the castle.

1974
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:19,370
Oh yeah, I see your horse.

1975
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:21,050
Yeah, that's my horse.

1976
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:23,490
You thought this was her dad?

1977
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,290
Yeah, I thought that was her dad.

1978
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:28,130
I was like, there's the dad.

1979
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:30,790
With beautiful, red, luscious hair.

1980
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:35,250
Totally what Belle is known for.

1981
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:36,830
Her red, luscious hair.

1982
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:38,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1983
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:41,530
She got the brown hair from the mom, right?

1984
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,470
Wow, there's so many...

1985
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,810
Wait, I'm going the right way, right?

1986
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:46,590
Where are we?

1987
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:48,130
I don't know, I'm looking at the map right now.

1988
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:49,070
We're at the forest hills.

1989
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:50,650
Oh, here we go, here we go.

1990
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:52,750
Oh, there it is!

1991
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:53,590
The castle!

1992
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:58,810
Oh, daddy's home.

1993
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:09,650
Why are you in the ground?

1994
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:14,270
The beast castle.

1995
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,250
Alright.

1996
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:17,890
There's Belle over there!

1997
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,820
We did it, Gaston!

1998
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,440
We killed the beast!

1999
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,000
We did it!

2000
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,780
The beast is down!

2001
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,960
Can you give me creative for a second?

2002
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,260
Just use your magic wand!

2003
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:35,860
Right click!

2004
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,000
Do you want to return to the hub?

2005
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,400
I have to go all the way back.

2006
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,140
No, left click, left click.

2007
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:42,320
Just TP to Belle.

2008
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,000
To the castle kitchen?

2009
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,380
No, I don't want to...

2010
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,080
Wait, hold on, I'll be there.

2011
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:51,540
Oh my god, there's me!

2012
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:53,020
Wait, hold on!

2013
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,040
Wait for me!

2014
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,480
We did it, everybody!

2015
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,100
We killed the beast!

2016
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:01,960
Kill the beast!

2017
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,440
Kill the beast!

2018
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,220
No, not me!

2019
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,540
You got the wrong guy!

2020
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,240
I'm his brother!

2021
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,540
Can you bring your horse back?

2022
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,160
So I have a horse to...

2023
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,460
I have to ride the horse back to you?

2024
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:27,340
And then what do I do?

2025
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:31,360
There's gotta be like a third horse.

2026
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,240
Just get over here.

2027
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:36,360
I'm trying.

2028
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,160
Am I going the right way?

2029
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,280
I think there might be another way.

2030
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:43,380
Wait, could I have gone this way?

2031
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,200
Just open your map.

2032
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,700
I'm going towards a mysterious path.

2033
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,220
What the fuck do you mean a mysterious path?

2034
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,000
Literally, the next thing is Belle.

2035
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:01,900
Couldn't Disney have paid for properly looping music in this game?

2036
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,340
I don't understand.

2037
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,760
They literally just made like Minecraft music of the soundtrack.

2038
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,240
I see your name.

2039
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:15,360
I see you too.

2040
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:21,200
This is like copyrighted Minecraft Beauty and the Beast music.

2041
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,660
Yeah, it's like just legally distinct.

2042
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,880
I just got someone with a really interesting name super chatting me.

2043
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,340
And I want you to confirm or deny.

2044
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,200
What is it?

2045
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,840
Eating Doki Bird's ass.

2046
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:42,480
They gave you money and not me?

2047
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,500
They're too busy eating your ass.

2048
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:52,480
I'm going to stand next to you and you won't know who's who.

2049
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:56,960
Oh wait, I actually thought you were...

2050
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,160
Wait,

2051
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,500
can I ride that?

2052
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,480
What do you mean, can I ride that?

2053
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,460
Oh my God, there's a dresser.

2054
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,280
You're Sonic running?

2055
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:17,580
He can't ride the style.

2056
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:20,020
I'll be Lumiere.

2057
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:24,040
Gasp, do my eyes deceive me or do we have a guest?

2058
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,680
Oh, you must be soaked to the bone.

2059
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,880
Please, please come in.

2060
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,920
You're me Cosworth.

2061
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,560
Lumiere, what are you doing?

2062
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:40,380
We can't let them go back out there.

2063
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,820
Please, you must stay.

2064
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:43,560
Be our guest.

2065
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:45,420
He said the thing.

2066
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,800
No, no, no.

2067
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,100
The master won't like this at all.

2068
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,040
Oh, Cosworth.

2069
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,220
Have a heart.

2070
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,620
Of course, they are welcome here.

2071
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:03,880
Now, let us introduce you to our other esteemed guest.

2072
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:05,780
Mademoiselle Belle.

2073
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,760
She is just over there.

2074
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:08,580
Where?

2075
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,560
What does that mean?

2076
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:09,900
Where?

2077
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,600
She's under there.

2078
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,460
Over here.

2079
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,080
Wait, I think she's at the kitchen.

2080
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:19,200
Oh, wow.

2081
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,560
They put the woman in the kitchen?

2082
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:22,420
Oh my God.

2083
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,880
She's flexing on us.

2084
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,220
Oh, it's a mini game.

2085
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2086
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:30,600
Be our guest.

2087
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,620
Be our guest.

2088
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:32,960
Oh my God.

2089
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,560
I bet you'd like a nice spot of tea.

2090
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,700
It'll warm you up in no time.

2091
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:41,660
Oh, that's it.

2092
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,420
That's all she says.

2093
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,640
Hey, wanna see me do a trick?

2094
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,600
That's what he says?

2095
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,460
Yeah, yeah, that's what he says.

2096
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,260
And he does a flip.

2097
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,000
What are you talking about, mama?

2098
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:51,460
What's going on?

2099
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,200
That might not be a cool trick, but can you do this?

2100
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,360
I'm gonna talk to Belle.

2101
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:04,240
I'm gonna talk to Belle.

2102
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:05,940
Oh, hello.

2103
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,040
It's very nice to meet you.

2104
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,880
Are you a guest here as well?

2105
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,900
Oh, I see.

2106
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,920
Gaston has sent you to rescue me, has he?

2107
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,540
Of course he'd never ask me what I want.

2108
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:19,940
Well, you can tell him.

2109
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:21,520
I'm not in any danger.

2110
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,220
Though I doubt he'd listen.

2111
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,020
Oh, you can be me, Belle.

2112
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:30,500
I don't think we can finish your surprise dinner in time.

2113
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:32,760
Our ideas may have been a bit ground.

2114
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,960
We would need more help in the kitchen.

2115
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:38,240
Oh, and do we have another guest?

2116
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,100
Yes, I'd hope they'd join us.

2117
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,440
Oh, but you're right.

2118
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:45,280
It is getting awfully late.

2119
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:48,300
Hmm...

2120
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,480
I think I have an idea.

2121
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,040
What if I help as well?

2122
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,460
I've read through the recipe book after all.

2123
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,660
Oh my god.

2124
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,140
Perhaps you could help us too.

2125
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,700
We could really use another pair of hands.

2126
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,840
I could read out the instructions while you help with the preparations.

2127
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,180
Oh boy, we're good at that.

2128
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,120
Oh yeah, we're so good at reading instructions.

2129
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,300
It's not like we just sequence break the last one.

2130
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,760
The horse just walked in.

2131
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:13,420
He just walked in.

2132
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:15,880
From like the corner of my eye.

2133
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,880
He's like, I'm hungry.

2134
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:25,040
Oh my god.

2135
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,900
How hungry.

2136
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,520
Alright, yeah, let's cook a meal.

2137
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,580
Wonderful, let's get started.

2138
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,180
Okay, Belle will tell you what to cook.

2139
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,760
Why does she keep flexing on us?

2140
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,260
I know, what is she doing?

2141
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,680
She's styling on us.

2142
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,420
I'll tell you which ingredients.

2143
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,560
Go and take the recipe, then you can prepare them and place them.

2144
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,060
On the dishes.

2145
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,200
Use ingredients on cooking.

2146
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,820
What the hell, is this overcooked?

2147
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:54,700
Yeah, I was thinking too.

2148
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,220
Lumiere will be waiting to take the plates to the dining room.

2149
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:01,940
Oh my god.

2150
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:02,960
Oh my god.

2151
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:06,780
Do they need to eat their inanimate objects?

2152
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,640
Yeah, but Belle needs to eat.

2153
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,700
Oh no, first, shall we...

2154
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,000
This calls for baked cheese.

2155
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,040
Where's cheese?

2156
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,860
Okay, and put it in the oven.

2157
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,140
Why does the master have to make food?

2158
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:20,840
Wait, what do I do?

2159
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:21,580
Put it in the oven?

2160
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,400
Yeah, that's the oven, right?

2161
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:24,680
That looks like an oven.

2162
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,660
Oh my god, it's actually playing the song!

2163
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,140
Wait, is it?

2164
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:35,460
Oh, it is!

2165
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,060
What is the...

2166
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:39,460
Wait, I think it shows us up here.

2167
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:43,460
Oh, we're supposed to...

2168
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,400
She makes...

2169
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,440
This is fun!

2170
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,860
What do I do?

2171
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:01,120
Oh, I have some cheese for you!

2172
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,240
I did it!

2173
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,720
Oh my god!

2174
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,860
Grab an apple and combine it with the wheat.

2175
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,500
I'm already doing it!

2176
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:17,300
Oh wait, we each...

2177
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,800
Wait, we do our own things.

2178
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,380
Are we competing?

2179
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,280
Oh my god!

2180
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,760
No, you took my wheat!

2181
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,220
I thought we were working together!

2182
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,740
I thought we were working together too!

2183
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:34,680
Oh my god!

2184
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,360
Oh my god, there's voices!

2185
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:36,940
I'm too distracted!

2186
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,720
Oh, nevermind.

2187
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,080
Oh, ok.

2188
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:54,860
Did that work?

2189
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:58,600
Uh...

2190
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:00,060
Pot...

2191
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:00,860
Pitcher...

2192
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:01,980
That's a person.

2193
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,560
Oh my god, that's messed up.

2194
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,480
Wait, where's the pitcher?

2195
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,280
Oh, there it is.

2196
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:08,640
Wait, huh?

2197
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:09,280
Huh?

2198
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:11,700
Where's the... Oh, here.

2199
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,040
Oh, and this.

2200
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:27,620
What's the other thing that I'm getting?

2201
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,100
Oh, spices.

2202
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,680
Ok, I got it.

2203
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,820
I figured it out.

2204
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,760
Wait, you already did it?

2205
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:36,680
Oh my god.

2206
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,160
Is that me?

2207
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:41,960
What is that?

2208
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:48,660
There I say!

2209
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:50,360
That was magical!

2210
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,820
It was rather fun.

2211
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,280
And we must thank our new friend for the help...

2212
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:56,420
Friend?

2213
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,520
Oh my god, look at her hips.

2214
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:04,320
Holy shit.

2215
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,260
I can't believe they actually started singing.

2216
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:10,220
It's because you don't have real plates.

2217
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:11,540
And you only use paper plates.

2218
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,880
I don't think we could have done it without you.

2219
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:18,960
What?

2220
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:21,540
It still keeps going.

2221
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,360
Bella keeps talking.

2222
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,780
Oh, now it's time for dinner.

2223
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:28,600
But if you'd like to help us practice these recipes again, just let us know.

2224
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:32,780
What is all this?

2225
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:34,760
And what are they doing here?

2226
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:35,600
Bella?

2227
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:37,820
It's alright.

2228
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:39,540
There's no need to worry.

2229
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,580
Our new friends...

2230
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:44,060
Helped us prepare this feast.

2231
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:45,160
For you.

2232
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:47,200
A feast?

2233
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:48,800
For me?

2234
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,040
Yes.

2235
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,420
I wanted to thank you for helping me escape from those wolves.

2236
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,200
It was my pleasure.

2237
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,520
I was worried about how to invite you to dinner.

2238
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:07,460
But I graciously accept.

2239
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:08,620
Shall we eat?

2240
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,020
Alright, let's go eat.

2241
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,200
Let's go eat.

2242
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,540
Oh my god, wait, they're in here.

2243
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:16,380
Oh my god, what is this dress?

2244
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:18,500
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2245
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,120
Hey, brother!

2246
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,860
He's so much bigger than you!

2247
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,640
Who's the real beast?

2248
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:27,840
Who's the real beast?

2249
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,540
Who could it be?

2250
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:43,700
I want to do something special for Bella.

2251
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:46,260
I've never felt this way about anyone before.

2252
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,500
Girl, what are you doing?

2253
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:53,600
What do we do next here?

2254
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:54,720
Do we just talk to them?

2255
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,240
I think this game might have been a scam.

2256
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,360
Is that it?

2257
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,860
There has to be... Is that it?

2258
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,320
Does it not...

2259
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,120
When do we kill the beast?

2260
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:07,600
That doesn't actually happen in the story.

2261
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:09,160
I want to kill the...

2262
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:09,900
Oh, there's the horse.

2263
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:09,940
Oh, there's the horse.

2264
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,380
Our horse went here.

2265
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:16,760
I want to know when we can kill the beast.

2266
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,060
Kill the beast.

2267
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,380
Kill the beast.

2268
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:25,840
Does the game part end when we get to the mini game?

2269
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:29,060
Yeah, I think there's like two dialogues and that's it.

2270
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:32,520
Oh my god, we'll never kill the beast.

2271
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,580
Where is the horse?

2272
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,760
Oh, he's in the library.

2273
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,160
There's a library?

2274
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,120
Oh my god.

2275
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,720
He wants to get educated.

2276
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:42,940
Oh, I see you.

2277
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,540
Wait, there's more here?

2278
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,420
Where does this go?

2279
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:51,640
I want to find the beast's room and then destroy his rose.

2280
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,580
Yeah, we got to destroy the rose.

2281
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,700
Destroy the... I found it!

2282
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:56,460
Wait, wait, wait.

2283
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:57,400
I want to see it.

2284
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:58,520
I found it.

2285
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:00,100
Is it up more?

2286
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,340
Yeah, it's up here.

2287
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:03,180
Watch, I'll do something crazy.

2288
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:05,500
No, I see you.

2289
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,620
Hold on.

2290
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:09,740
Oh shit.

2291
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:11,380
Watch.

2292
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,460
Do you see this rose?

2293
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:13,920
Yeah.

2294
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:15,660
Wait.

2295
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:17,640
Oh.

2296
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,620
There's a watermelon under here!

2297
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:24,560
It's gone now.

2298
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,140
There's a watermelon under here!

2299
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:29,040
What?

2300
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,960
And thus the beast shall die.

2301
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,360
Why is it melon?

2302
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,120
Oh my god.

2303
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,040
This place is full of cobwebs.

2304
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,140
I mean, it's old.

2305
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:43,860
Look, the rose is gone.

2306
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:44,760
I did it.

2307
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,240
Whoa.

2308
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,240
Yeah, you did it.

2309
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:48,740
I'm proud of you.

2310
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,360
I did it.

2311
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:50,320
We did it.

2312
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:51,760
We destroyed the beast's home.

2313
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,180
Land on that...

2314
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,020
Did you say hole?

2315
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,320
Home.

2316
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,340
And thus my job here...

2317
01:32:58,340 --> 01:32:58,880
Wait, wait, wait.

2318
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,480
Look at me.

2319
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:01,120
Where are you?

2320
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:01,700
Look, I'm here.

2321
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:02,800
I'm proud of you.

2322
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:04,420
My job here is done.

2323
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,200
I thought you were gonna jump off.

2324
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:15,300
Wait, I wonder...

2325
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,160
Oh my god.

2326
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:18,980
It's your brother.

2327
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,340
Wait, I'm gonna be a gargoyle?

2328
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:23,340
My job here is done.

2329
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:24,780
Do I look good?

2330
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:25,840
Oh my god.

2331
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:28,100
Oh yeah.

2332
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,940
Oh my god.

2333
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,840
You look just like him.

2334
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,080
Which one's the real gargoyle?

2335
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,340
Which one's the real gargoyle?

2336
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,640
Wait, there's a...

2337
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:37,700
There's a garden in the back.

2338
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:38,800
Wait, is there?

2339
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:40,420
You wanna be creative mode?

2340
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,500
Okay, okay, okay.

2341
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,920
Game mode, creative...

2342
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,720
Wait, what's your...

2343
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:49,040
What's your full name?

2344
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,620
Made Mint Phantom, I think.

2345
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,880
Made Mint Phantom creative.

2346
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:54,320
Did you get it?

2347
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,160
Oh, I didn't.

2348
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:57,500
Wait, how do I give you creative?

2349
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,240
Uh, slash...

2350
01:33:59,240 --> 01:33:59,660
What is it?

2351
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:00,920
Game mode?

2352
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:02,900
Uh...

2353
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:05,320
Creative...

2354
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:06,340
Made...

2355
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,580
Oh, here you go.

2356
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:08,600
Yeah!

2357
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:11,300
Yeah!

2358
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,580
Now we can zoom everywhere.

2359
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:15,180
What's this?

2360
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:15,640
A book?

2361
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:17,760
That is a collectible.

2362
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:21,020
You know, silly Belle, leaving her stuff around.

2363
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,220
I'm gonna destroy this castle.

2364
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,700
Kill the beast!

2365
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:30,300
Kill the beast!

2366
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:30,800
Kill the beast!

2367
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,660
I know he's got treasure in the basement!

2368
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,080
He's gotta have treasure in the basement!

2369
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,280
Oh, the melons are back!

2370
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,740
Why is there melons in his home?

2371
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,020
Oh, it's like the tiles.

2372
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,760
It's the green tiles.

2373
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,660
They used melon for it.

2374
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:48,960
Oh...

2375
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,040
Alright, I'm going.

2376
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:52,020
Kill the beast!

2377
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:52,620
Kill the beast!

2378
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,920
I'm going into the basement.

2379
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,880
Are we bad people?

2380
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,280
No...

2381
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,120
I'm trying to get into this hole.

2382
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,240
Maybe they'll have like...

2383
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:20,700
Prisoners down there.

2384
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:21,480
Let's see.

2385
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,600
I'm gonna kill Gaston.

2386
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:24,460
Just for the sake of it.

2387
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:27,280
Where are you, Gaston?

2388
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:28,380
I can't believe it.

2389
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,800
We don't actually get to kill the beast.

2390
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:30,840
What's the point?

2391
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,400
Come on, guys.

2392
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:34,540
Torch.

2393
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:36,020
There we go.

2394
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:42,060
We're more villainous than Disney villains.

2395
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,060
Where are you, Gaston?

2396
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:48,420
Oh my god, you're still down there?

2397
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:52,200
Where did you dig to?

2398
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:53,800
Where are you?

2399
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:59,560
Surely there's treasure down here.

2400
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,120
Oh my god.

2401
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:13,000
Here we go.

2402
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,560
Into the void.

2403
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:15,940
Into the unknown.

2404
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:19,340
Yeah, where's Frozen World?

2405
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
I found the basement.

2406
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,560
Nothing but the abyss.

2407
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,060
Into the unknown.

2408
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,500
That's where they send the prisoners.

2409
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,700
Right here, sir.

2410
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,080
This is where they are.

2411
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:42,780
Oh my god, where am I?

2412
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:43,920
Oh, there I am.

2413
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,320
Can I save my horse now?

2414
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,060
I don't know.

2415
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:51,000
I don't know where your horse is.

2416
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:51,420
He's down here.

2417
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,440
He's a bit further than before.

2418
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:59,540
I wonder what the collectible is here.

2419
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,040
Explore all areas.

2420
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:03,640
Find the hidden books.

2421
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,060
Assist Belle.

2422
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,400
Oh yeah, we got most of everything.

2423
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,780
Yeah, we got everything.

2424
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,440
We basically finished this world.

2425
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,520
I'm going back to the hub.

2426
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,880
I'm just exploring a little bit.

2427
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,380
I don't think there's anywhere to explore.

2428
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,220
This is where like...

2429
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:19,920
This is the edge of the world.

2430
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:21,560
Who the hell is this farmer?

2431
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:22,700
I'm gonna burn the village.

2432
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:26,940
Burn Gaston.

2433
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,540
Upcoming fact.

2434
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:32,000
What the hell?

2435
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,920
I'm Alter Lumiere.

2436
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:36,760
I'm here to burn the village.

2437
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,780
You try to kill the beast.

2438
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,460
I'll kill the world.

2439
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:41,020
Hold on.

2440
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:42,940
I can send him.

2441
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:43,520
Please.

2442
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,440
Oh shit.

2443
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,760
I know how to kill Gaston.

2444
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,500
Wait, what?

2445
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,080
Wait, what happened?

2446
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:53,740
What are you doing?

2447
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:54,660
Wait,

2448
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:03,060
he has a task for us.

2449
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,500
Why does he have an excavation point?

2450
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,340
No, he doesn't.

2451
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:07,980
It was just going to the beast.

2452
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:11,860
We know how to kill Gaston.

2453
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,060
Wait, I can't see anything.

2454
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,340
Oh shit, where is he?

2455
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,700
We know what to do now.

2456
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:23,940
We know what to do now.

2457
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,760
I'll go down first.

2458
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,360
And then, I believe you're here.

2459
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,320
And I'll dig up with you.

2460
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:36,840
Okay.

2461
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:38,400
Oh shit.

2462
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,120
Goodbye, Gaston.

2463
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,480
Goodbye, Gaston.

2464
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,720
Goodbye, Gaston.

2465
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,300
He's so dreamy.

2466
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:48,380
Gaston.

2467
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:49,920
Rest in peace.

2468
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:54,400
I went down your hole.

2469
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,760
I picked the wrong hole.

2470
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,060
There he goes.

2471
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:02,560
Goodbye, Gaston.

2472
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,900
There he goes.

2473
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:11,240
Goodbye, Gaston.

2474
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:15,460
We could send the whole village down here.

2475
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,560
Can you do this?

2476
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:26,160
What are you doing?

2477
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:28,400
Can we TP all?

2478
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,000
TP all?

2479
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,980
TP all NPCs?

2480
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,820
Is that TP...

2481
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:34,540
Oh, it doesn't work.

2482
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:36,420
Oh, we gotta try.

2483
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:41,060
This is where he went.

2484
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:44,180
TP...

2485
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:46,920
TP...

2486
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:50,200
TP...

2487
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,040
Oh my god, I know there's one where you can...

2488
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,320
Oh, at all entities.

2489
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,340
Oh my god!

2490
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,740
You're gonna break the game for real!

2491
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:01,540
But...

2492
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:02,680
Will he kill him?

2493
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:03,200
Oh no.

2494
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:08,820
Oh my god!

2495
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,240
Did I do it?

2496
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:12,740
Did I break the game?

2497
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,040
Where are you?

2498
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:21,100
What happened?

2499
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:22,500
Did I break the game?

2500
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:24,520
Oh wait, wait, wait!

2501
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:47,050
I'm here too!

2502
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:47,950
Where are you?

2503
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:50,070
I

2504
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,380
don't know what happened!

2505
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:08,310
The beast is no more.

2506
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:09,570
The beast is no more!

2507
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:11,310
What is that?

2508
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:11,970
Oh hello.

2509
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:14,050
Let me change my clothes.

2510
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:16,930
We gotta dress for the occasion.

2511
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:19,290
I'm dressing for the occasion.

2512
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:19,970
Me too!

2513
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:22,490
Which one are you gonna be?

2514
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:23,810
Don't wear my same outfit.

2515
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:31,310
Alright, I'm turning around.

2516
01:41:33,930 --> 01:41:34,530
Where are you?

2517
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:43,380
Where are you?

2518
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:04,220
Alright, let's go commit some wishes.

2519
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:09,280
Why is this world's volume so much louder?

2520
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:12,420
Wait, we can go get all the treasure!

2521
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:13,940
Oh true!

2522
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,060
Oh my god, let's free ourselves!

2523
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,080
We don't need Aladdin!

2524
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,020
We don't need Aladdin!

2525
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:23,660
We can free ourselves!

2526
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:26,180
Alright, let's go.

2527
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,140
We have what we call creative mode.

2528
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:33,120
We're rich!

2529
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:34,920
We're rich!

2530
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,240
Abu, don't touch it!

2531
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,260
Don't touch the stuff.

2532
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,160
Don't touch it, Abu.

2533
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:43,880
Oh my god.

2534
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:45,960
We can be Aladdin.

2535
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:53,500
Oops, I didn't mean to grab this.

2536
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,220
Yeah, break that.

2537
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:55,620
Oh, I can't.

2538
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:56,520
You can't break it.

2539
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,260
We can send it to the...

2540
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:01,020
Into the unknown!

2541
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:02,440
Into the unknown!

2542
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,720
Can your friend do this?

2543
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,920
Can your friend do...

2544
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,460
Can your friend do that?

2545
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:10,920
Can your friend do...

2546
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:12,180
Can your friend do this?

2547
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,440
That's the same thing!

2548
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,640
Why can't we go into the hole?

2549
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:22,500
There we go.

2550
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,000
Alright, here we go!

2551
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:27,020
Into the unknown!

2552
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:30,420
Oh my god.

2553
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:31,620
How fast have you dug?

2554
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:33,520
I've already dug.

2555
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:35,020
We're free!

2556
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:39,000
We don't need Aladdin.

2557
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:40,700
Aladdin will never get this down.

2558
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,580
That's right.

2559
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:45,420
We're not chained to nobody.

2560
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,240
We're free genies now.

2561
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,740
We're free genies.

2562
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,400
You're so stupid.

2563
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,920
I'm breaking out of here.

2564
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,100
I'm digging up.

2565
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:07,360
I'm not going to be trapped here.

2566
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,920
I don't know where I ended up.

2567
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:11,460
I'm outside of bounds.

2568
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:13,080
Don't dig up.

2569
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,860
I'm right here.

2570
01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:18,400
There's an invisible wall.

2571
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:23,960
I broke it.

2572
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,040
That's right.

2573
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,180
Nothing can block us.

2574
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:28,500
Nothing can block us.

2575
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,720
We're invincible now.

2576
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,720
Powerful genies!

2577
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:40,580
Where's the sultan?

2578
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:41,580
I'm going to kidnap the sultan.

2579
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:48,040
Give us the throne.

2580
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:49,080
Give us the throne.

2581
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,420
Or we'll send you to the void.

2582
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:52,800
He's crying.

2583
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:54,620
He's crying.

2584
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:56,940
Yeah, look at him.

2585
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,960
Look, look, look.

2586
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,880
He's like, that's right, be afraid.

2587
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:05,620
Wait, what if I do this?

2588
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:07,300
Watch this.

2589
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:11,680
Give us the throne or I'm going to shoot you.

2590
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:14,720
Why can't...

2591
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,040
That's right.

2592
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,900
Give us the throne or I'll shoot.

2593
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:29,230
Alright, sultan.

2594
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:31,690
What are you doing?

2595
01:45:34,930 --> 01:45:36,030
What are you doing?

2596
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:39,850
I'm poisoning him.

2597
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:42,550
Oh my God.

2598
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:45,470
I'm poisoning the throne.

2599
01:45:45,690 --> 01:45:46,950
Wait, go out of creative.

2600
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:48,510
Okay, okay.

2601
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:49,650
See if it works.

2602
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:52,230
Game mode adventure.

2603
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:53,510
Okay.

2604
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:56,330
I'm okay.

2605
01:45:56,830 --> 01:45:57,890
Oh, it doesn't work?

2606
01:45:58,330 --> 01:45:59,850
What the hell?

2607
01:46:00,330 --> 01:46:01,690
No, you didn't poison me.

2608
01:46:01,810 --> 01:46:02,070
No!

2609
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:04,490
I've been lied to.

2610
01:46:06,330 --> 01:46:08,410
Oh, you know, like, one thing I'm...

2611
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:11,990
One thing I pride myself on, I'm an excellent judge of character.

2612
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:14,110
Somebody said?

2613
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:17,870
That's right.

2614
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:18,290
Go inside.

2615
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:23,290
Where did you go?

2616
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:24,290
I'm looking for Jafar.

2617
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:26,590
I wonder if we...

2618
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:30,710
What is the tiger's name?

2619
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:32,450
I forgot.

2620
01:46:33,490 --> 01:46:34,890
Wait, where did you go?

2621
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:36,010
I'm outside.

2622
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:38,550
Are you with Jasmine?

2623
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:40,730
No, I think she's at the beginning.

2624
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:42,450
No, she's right here.

2625
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:42,970
Where?

2626
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:46,430
Wait, there's a magic carpet.

2627
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:48,610
Are you in her room?

2628
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:50,070
No, no, no.

2629
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:51,470
I'm right here.

2630
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:53,170
Where's the tiger?

2631
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:54,490
Over here.

2632
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:55,830
Someone says Raja.

2633
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:58,530
Oh, there he is!

2634
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:59,870
There he is!

2635
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:02,470
Oh my God, he's so cute!

2636
01:47:05,690 --> 01:47:06,690
Hello, Raja.

2637
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:07,970
Alright, show me Jasmine.

2638
01:47:08,710 --> 01:47:11,550
Okay, she's like...

2639
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:12,690
Call me Gelatin.

2640
01:47:13,210 --> 01:47:13,690
Gelatin?

2641
01:47:13,690 --> 01:47:16,270
Have you ever seen that song?

2642
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:16,810
No!

2643
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:21,370
That's Aladdin and Jasmine.

2644
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:24,530
Let me break this invisible wall.

2645
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:26,430
Wait, how do we...

2646
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:27,530
Why is there an invisible wall?

2647
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:30,190
I guess we're not allowed to fly.

2648
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:31,610
Wait, how do we access this?

2649
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:34,030
I think we have to talk to Jasmine back there.

2650
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:35,110
To access this.

2651
01:47:35,630 --> 01:47:36,370
Let me talk to her.

2652
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:40,190
Alright, Jasmine, we need you to head over there...

2653
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:41,550
so we can activate your game.

2654
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:42,110
Yeah.

2655
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:45,190
Oh, there he is, yeah.

2656
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:46,550
Where's Aladdin?

2657
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:50,190
Welcome to Agrabah, my name is Jasmine.

2658
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:51,070
It's probably in a town.

2659
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:52,210
Aladdin, right?

2660
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:55,410
The magic carpet droops down sadly.

2661
01:47:57,810 --> 01:47:59,590
Magic carpet ride.

2662
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:00,470
Alright, let's go.

2663
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:01,770
Oh, I see her, I see her.

2664
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:02,450
She's already here.

2665
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:05,110
A whole new world!

2666
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:07,990
I'm gonna stay in Adventure.

2667
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:09,310
Where is Aladdin?

2668
01:48:09,310 --> 01:48:10,330
Activate the game.

2669
01:48:12,670 --> 01:48:13,750
Where is Aladdin?

2670
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:17,990
That guy is blonde with blue eyes.

2671
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:19,570
I don't think he belongs here.

2672
01:48:22,190 --> 01:48:23,610
Are you lost, buddy?

2673
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:27,790
Alright, I'm talking to Jasmine.

2674
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:28,810
Okay.

2675
01:48:30,010 --> 01:48:31,130
Alright, hey you scoundrel.

2676
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:32,070
Did you steal that apple?

2677
01:48:32,210 --> 01:48:33,730
Of course not, we're only talking.

2678
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:35,510
The scoundrel probably ate it.

2679
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:36,670
No one steals from my cart.

2680
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:37,350
Thief!

2681
01:48:37,870 --> 01:48:38,290
Thief!

2682
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:38,690
Alright.

2683
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:41,630
Okay.

2684
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:45,430
Ride on the magic carpet to escape from the angry shopkeepers.

2685
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:48,110
You need to steer in the right direction.

2686
01:48:48,350 --> 01:48:50,030
Wait, are we both on the magic carpet?

2687
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:50,590
No.

2688
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,230
I just... wait.

2689
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:53,970
I think it's a one person game.

2690
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:55,750
Wait, is this a one person?

2691
01:48:55,850 --> 01:48:57,050
Reach the end to win?

2692
01:48:57,170 --> 01:48:58,250
Wait, are you racing?

2693
01:48:59,110 --> 01:48:59,490
I don't think...

2694
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:00,310
You see this instruction?

2695
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:02,250
I only...

2696
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:03,970
I had to...

2697
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:05,450
Zoom through the text.

2698
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:08,110
Oh no, I think...

2699
01:49:08,110 --> 01:49:09,410
Wait, I'm stuck in the loading screen.

2700
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:10,110
Yeah, me too.

2701
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:15,170
I think we broke the game.

2702
01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:15,750
Yes!

2703
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:30,130
Is our Disney tour over?

2704
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:34,150
Is it because we didn't properly load into this world?

2705
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:35,750
I think so.

2706
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:38,550
I think it's because we deleted the pizza.

2707
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:41,050
We deleted the castle.

2708
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:45,870
Move!

2709
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:54,870
I want to ride the magic carpet.

2710
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:58,250
No, I want it to be a whole new world.

2711
01:49:58,930 --> 01:49:59,670
Let's quit.

2712
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:00,230
I'm going to quit.

2713
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:03,050
And I'm going to join again.

2714
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:03,950
Yeah, me too.

2715
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:06,750
We just want to go to a whole new world.

2716
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:07,950
I want to ride the magic carpet.

2717
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:09,250
We can at least do all the minigames.

2718
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:09,790
I'm back!

2719
01:50:10,830 --> 01:50:13,530
I got the obstacle.

2720
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:15,810
Do we just go?

2721
01:50:15,810 --> 01:50:16,230
Wait.

2722
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:19,170
Okay, I'm in game mode.

2723
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:21,910
Maybe we have to be on adventure, both of us.

2724
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:23,350
I'll give it to you.

2725
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:24,190
Wait, there's Abu!

2726
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:26,490
Are you in the minigame?

2727
01:50:27,930 --> 01:50:29,090
No, I'm in.

2728
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:31,190
Are you in the lobby?

2729
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:32,990
I just discovered a secret room.

2730
01:50:33,930 --> 01:50:35,430
Wait, where are you?

2731
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:37,890
Oh, you just dropped me!

2732
01:50:37,890 --> 01:50:41,630
I can't get out.

2733
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:45,590
I was a spectator.

2734
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,120
Far beneath the ground.

2735
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:54,560
Okay, I'm good.

2736
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:56,540
Okay, where are you?

2737
01:50:56,580 --> 01:50:57,780
Is that you?

2738
01:50:58,820 --> 01:50:59,420
Where are you?

2739
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:00,620
Are you holding a book?

2740
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:01,900
Yeah, I'm holding a book.

2741
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,660
You are invisible to me.

2742
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:06,120
Look!

2743
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:16,200
Wait, can you go into spectator mode?

2744
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:18,580
Can you put us both in spectator?

2745
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:22,600
I need to show you.

2746
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:25,340
I need to show you where I went.

2747
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:30,940
Why are we invisible?

2748
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,940
It's like a magic trick.

2749
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:35,780
Okay, now go below...

2750
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:37,880
Do you see the two hidden rooms?

2751
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:44,580
Why is there red in the fucking room?

2752
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:47,640
And I was trapped in here.

2753
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:49,940
I was trapped in here.

2754
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,940
It was literally my grave.

2755
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,820
Thank you for the red.

2756
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:57,620
Thank you so much.

2757
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:58,640
Good.

2758
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:01,760
Wait, I see the blonde man.

2759
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:02,920
Where is he?

2760
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:05,260
I don't think the game is any better.

2761
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:06,660
I think it's still messed up.

2762
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,140
I think we messed up.

2763
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,440
Wait, put us back to adventure.

2764
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,580
And then we'll...

2765
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,720
Put us back to adventure and we can just...

2766
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:19,720
Take us back to the hub.

2767
01:52:20,140 --> 01:52:20,700
Okay, okay.

2768
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:23,060
Adventure.

2769
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,960
I didn't see Aladdin.

2770
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,500
I don't know what happened to him.

2771
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:29,740
He just disappeared.

2772
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:30,680
Disappeared.

2773
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:33,140
Where did you go?

2774
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:35,520
Are you going back to the hub?

2775
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:36,780
Yeah, I want to go back to the hub.

2776
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,660
Wait, you cannot tell...

2777
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:40,340
We're stuck in the game.

2778
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,240
I'm starting the game.

2779
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,520
Wait, how do you start the game?

2780
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,400
We broke the game.

2781
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:54,380
We actually broke the game.

2782
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:56,800
We were never supposed to be here.

2783
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,800
Wait, is that you?

2784
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:06,060
I see a magical path.

2785
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:06,860
I don't know what that is.

2786
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:07,780
We broke the game.

2787
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:10,920
We were supposed to ride on the magic carpet.

2788
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:15,040
It didn't give us a magic carpet.

2789
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:16,220
But they did.

2790
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,400
I've been slowed.

2791
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:20,360
What do you mean you've been slowed?

2792
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:22,840
Apparently, if you hit a wall, you get slowed.

2793
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,020
How did you get a magic carpet?

2794
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:26,260
I don't know.

2795
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:27,420
I'm running the course.

2796
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:32,140
No!

2797
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:33,660
Wait, what's happening?

2798
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:35,440
I can't move.

2799
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,420
Wait, I'm starting the race!

2800
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:40,300
We're starting the race!

2801
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:43,760
Guards arrived?

2802
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:44,640
What does that mean?

2803
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:51,980
Are we on a carpet?

2804
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:54,960
I think we're just running.

2805
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,180
I think we're just running.

2806
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:01,920
I think we're just running.

2807
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:03,820
I think we're just running.

2808
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:09,380
I think we're just running.

2809
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:16,950
Oh no, how am I going to get over there?

2810
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:17,550
No!

2811
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:20,670
I have to restart because I...

2812
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:22,830
I broke...

2813
01:54:22,830 --> 01:54:23,650
Be careful!

2814
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:25,210
I made it!

2815
01:54:25,750 --> 01:54:29,830
I ran through the one hole I dug.

2816
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:34,450
I ran through the one hole I dug.

2817
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:41,050
No, no, no!

2818
01:54:41,230 --> 01:54:42,470
That's not what happened.

2819
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:43,770
I

2820
01:54:49,650 --> 01:54:50,790
can have the carpet.

2821
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:53,330
Wait, are you on the carpet?

2822
01:54:56,770 --> 01:54:59,070
I hit the right click, the carpet!

2823
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:06,290
I just watched you.

2824
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:08,590
I didn't realize.

2825
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:10,290
It's so unfair.

2826
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:11,930
I'm doing this again.

2827
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:14,270
I'm doing...

2828
01:55:14,270 --> 01:55:16,470
I literally watched you...

2829
01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:19,370
I literally watched you drop the carpet.

2830
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:20,670
And you kept going.

2831
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:28,690
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

2832
01:55:29,230 --> 01:55:30,430
I'm in tears.

2833
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,790
What?

2834
01:55:40,890 --> 01:55:42,530
It's so slow!

2835
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:45,510
It's so slow!

2836
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:48,970
I don't think you can touch anything with it.

2837
01:55:49,070 --> 01:55:52,450
Or rather, you can't press space or...

2838
01:55:52,450 --> 01:55:54,350
Bro, why am I so slow?

2839
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:56,870
Oh god.

2840
01:55:57,150 --> 01:55:58,190
I'm crying.

2841
01:55:58,930 --> 01:56:01,630
I can't see the track between my tears.

2842
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:06,270
I don't know.

2843
01:56:14,890 --> 01:56:22,150
Oh my god.

2844
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:24,470
Oh my god.

2845
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:27,090
Oh my god, we did it.

2846
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:29,370
Oh my god.

2847
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:36,470
Oh my god.

2848
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:37,130
Oh my god.

2849
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:38,250
We can talk to the carpet.

2850
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:40,130
Yeah, he just restarts the world.

2851
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:42,350
Where's Aladdin in all of this?

2852
01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:44,510
I don't know, we saw his monkey, we saw a bull.

2853
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:47,210
We saw a bull, we saw...

2854
01:56:47,210 --> 01:56:49,390
We didn't see Jafar though, but like...

2855
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:50,570
Where the fuck is...

2856
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:51,830
Where the fuck...

2857
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:53,910
In Agrabah, there's no Aladdin?

2858
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:00,110
What the hell?

2859
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:02,570
What the fuck, where are we?

2860
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:04,050
We're on the racetrack.

2861
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:05,390
Arabian Nights.

2862
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:09,590
Arabian Nights.

2863
01:57:24,290 --> 01:57:26,370
I think we actually destroyed...

2864
01:57:26,370 --> 01:57:28,430
Wait, I'm gonna check if Belle's world is still back.

2865
01:57:28,570 --> 01:57:30,470
I'm TP back, I need to know.

2866
01:57:30,910 --> 01:57:32,730
Oh, I broke all the portals.

2867
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:34,870
Wait, what do you mean you broke all the portals?

2868
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:38,090
Wait, come back.

2869
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:39,570
None of the portals.

2870
01:57:52,730 --> 01:57:57,690
Wait, what if we use the staff to teleport to one of the minigames?

2871
01:57:58,650 --> 01:57:59,830
Let's go to...

2872
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:01,870
Let's go to Maze Chase.

2873
01:58:02,070 --> 01:58:04,910
They kicked us out, I think they closed the portals.

2874
01:58:07,090 --> 01:58:09,010
They can't stop us.

2875
01:58:10,330 --> 01:58:12,130
Oh, I've been to Alice in Wonderland.

2876
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:12,830
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2877
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:14,050
So this works?

2878
01:58:15,070 --> 01:58:16,370
Oh yeah, we gotta change worlds.

2879
01:58:16,370 --> 01:58:18,810
The borders will stop us.

2880
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:28,370
They really think you can't stop us from coming here.

2881
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:33,430
We'll always find a way.

2882
01:58:35,890 --> 01:58:40,330
You fucked it in two hours, but Organization 13 couldn't do.

2883
01:58:40,330 --> 01:58:40,350
You fucked it in two hours, but Organization 13 couldn't do.

2884
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:49,590
You just get us in, Kingdom Hearts will finish.

2885
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:53,690
We won't even have Kingdom Hearts 4, the game will finish in Kingdom Hearts 1.

2886
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:55,250
You will kill Sora.

2887
01:58:56,370 --> 01:58:57,270
Where are you?

2888
01:58:57,650 --> 01:58:59,090
I'm right behind you.

2889
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:00,410
You're invisible to me.

2890
01:59:00,570 --> 01:59:02,350
Oh no, you're not invisible.

2891
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:04,350
Maybe if I change skins.

2892
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:07,210
Oh, I just hit you.

2893
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:08,290
Oh yeah, I see you.

2894
01:59:12,370 --> 01:59:12,790
Alright.

2895
01:59:14,210 --> 01:59:15,530
Okay, there we go.

2896
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:17,830
Oh wait, Autobot, Autobot.

2897
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:19,130
Oh wait, Autobot, you're right.

2898
01:59:19,470 --> 01:59:21,990
Alright, do you like my bow?

2899
01:59:23,070 --> 01:59:23,510
Yeah.

2900
01:59:24,330 --> 01:59:26,030
You're a shark cat with a gun.

2901
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:35,950
This feels on brand for the Mad Hatter.

2902
01:59:36,270 --> 01:59:37,430
Yeah, it does actually.

2903
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:41,330
A very unbirthday to you.

2904
01:59:41,330 --> 01:59:42,050
To you.

2905
01:59:42,430 --> 01:59:45,670
So, when I was in grade school...

2906
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:46,750
No, middle school.

2907
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:49,990
Also, why is the music in here so intense?

2908
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:56,750
But when I was in middle school, I wanted to be the Mad Hatter for my school's Halloween.

2909
01:59:57,610 --> 01:59:57,910
Yeah.

2910
01:59:58,310 --> 01:59:59,230
Why'd you leave?

2911
01:59:59,670 --> 02:00:00,870
Oh wait, I tabbed out.

2912
02:00:03,650 --> 02:00:08,810
So my mom got me a costume, but it was one of those sexy costumes that said like...

2913
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:10,030
Oh my God!

2914
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:12,630
His hat said 69 over 420.

2915
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:14,070
Oh my God!

2916
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:17,470
Am I a shark cat or am I Steve?

2917
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:18,170
You're Steve.

2918
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:21,430
Okay, I gotta re-wear my clothes again.

2919
02:00:22,370 --> 02:00:28,190
I didn't know what it meant until my mom, or not my mom, my teacher told me what it meant.

2920
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:29,430
Oh.

2921
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:34,230
Wait, if it's a sexy costume, then like, wouldn't it be like, sexy?

2922
02:00:34,790 --> 02:00:39,610
I wore like, a tank top and stuff underneath it so nothing would show.

2923
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:42,450
Alright, ever since I arrived...

2924
02:00:42,450 --> 02:00:43,450
Okay, you can be Alice.

2925
02:00:44,090 --> 02:00:45,370
Hello, I'm Alice.

2926
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:47,970
I do hope you're someone who is sensical.

2927
02:00:48,430 --> 02:00:51,090
Ever since I arrived here, so much has been nonsense.

2928
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:56,850
Oh, but you do seem as though you are what you are rather than being not what you are not.

2929
02:00:57,510 --> 02:00:58,690
Perhaps you might help me.

2930
02:00:59,730 --> 02:01:01,990
I fear I may have angered the Queen.

2931
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:05,470
You see, she sent her playing card guards...

2932
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:09,190
Oh my gosh, that is so hard to say, playing card guards.

2933
02:01:10,670 --> 02:01:12,410
To chase me through this maze.

2934
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:14,710
Would you help me find a way out?

2935
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:16,230
Oh, thank you.

2936
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:18,010
Quick, we must find an exit.

2937
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:20,950
Alright, what do we do?

2938
02:01:21,010 --> 02:01:21,930
We collect paint.

2939
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:24,830
Wait, the leaves are disappearing.

2940
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:26,090
Yeah, I know, the leaves...

2941
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:28,570
Wait, how are we gonna do the maze if the leaves are disappearing?

2942
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:30,910
We paint the roses to unlock the path.

2943
02:01:31,530 --> 02:01:33,550
Avoid the card soldiers, okay?

2944
02:01:34,190 --> 02:01:35,110
Wait, this is scary.

2945
02:01:35,870 --> 02:01:36,670
Yeah, this is scary.

2946
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:37,990
What if they jump scare us?

2947
02:01:38,010 --> 02:01:39,010
Get to the end to win...

2948
02:01:39,010 --> 02:01:40,290
Why are the leaves disappearing?

2949
02:01:41,530 --> 02:01:43,410
Did somebody paint the roses already?

2950
02:01:43,990 --> 02:01:44,350
Oh, oh, oh.

2951
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:45,090
Oh god.

2952
02:01:48,050 --> 02:01:49,110
Oh, we're competing!

2953
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:54,350
Sin Wonderland...

2954
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:55,670
Wait, oh, did I not get the paint?

2955
02:01:55,750 --> 02:01:56,950
Oh, you have to right click the paint.

2956
02:01:59,670 --> 02:02:03,390
How do you get to Wonderland?

2957
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:09,260
Do you just have to...

2958
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:10,000
Oh my god, they're coming.

2959
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:14,520
We're not competing.

2960
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:16,360
Yes, we are.

2961
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:17,420
How do you know?

2962
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:19,260
We have the same score.

2963
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:22,280
Because we haven't found the exit yet.

2964
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:24,680
Wait, where am I?

2965
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,080
Where am I?

2966
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:29,080
I know where you are, so I...

2967
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:36,820
Do you just paint any rose?

2968
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:37,580
I'm so confused.

2969
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:38,480
I guess so.

2970
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:39,440
This is kind of weird.

2971
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:41,260
I don't know where I am.

2972
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,040
There's no more paint.

2973
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:48,700
They're only chasing after me.

2974
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:50,220
This is messed up.

2975
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:53,440
I beat the game.

2976
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:55,340
Sin Wonderland...

2977
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:55,700
Wait, what?

2978
02:02:57,300 --> 02:02:58,640
Where are you?

2979
02:02:58,780 --> 02:02:59,340
Where am I?

2980
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:01,960
Oh, there's more paint.

2981
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:03,660
Where did I go?

2982
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:04,940
I don't know.

2983
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:13,000
I broke the game.

2984
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:16,340
No, you didn't.

2985
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,760
Oh, I made it out.

2986
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:22,060
I actually made it out.

2987
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:23,520
I'll give you a creative move.

2988
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:24,740
I'll show you where I went.

2989
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:25,380
Okay, okay.

2990
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:28,580
I was like, how did I get here?

2991
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:31,840
I actually...

2992
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,780
I actually won the game.

2993
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:36,940
Okay, follow me.

2994
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,040
Follow me.

2995
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:39,700
I'm breaking this wall.

2996
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:41,260
Break it, break it.

2997
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:42,920
Break the wall.

2998
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,820
Okay, so I...

2999
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:48,340
I ran this way.

3000
02:03:48,460 --> 02:03:50,680
So obviously we have to go here, right?

3001
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:51,940
This is where we have to go.

3002
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:53,780
But like, I went...

3003
02:03:53,780 --> 02:03:54,360
Watch, follow me.

3004
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:55,720
I went this way.

3005
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:58,680
And then there was a hole right here.

3006
02:03:59,460 --> 02:03:59,700
And...

3007
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:01,200
You went through here.

3008
02:04:01,580 --> 02:04:03,420
And then I was like...

3009
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:06,080
And then I went all the way.

3010
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:07,180
Follow me.

3011
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:09,380
I went all the way.

3012
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:13,340
I was like...

3013
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:13,440
What?

3014
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:14,020
Wait.

3015
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:19,200
Oh my god.

3016
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:20,260
I was like, I did it.

3017
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:22,000
And I was like, wait, this is a secret.

3018
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:25,800
Why would they even let you in here?

3019
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:27,080
I don't know.

3020
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:30,740
I literally was like running through these black maze.

3021
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:32,680
And I was like, oh my god, I did it.

3022
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,160
The music here is so crazy.

3023
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:38,660
Why did it go black?

3024
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:40,280
I was so confused.

3025
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:41,500
Let me in.

3026
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:46,040
I was so confused.

3027
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:48,460
I didn't realize...

3028
02:04:48,460 --> 02:04:50,260
I was not even in the game.

3029
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,860
Why is it so intense?

3030
02:04:58,500 --> 02:04:59,280
Oh, cute.

3031
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,420
Wait, the flower area is so cute.

3032
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:05,640
Oh, yeah, it is.

3033
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:07,300
You can talk to the flowers.

3034
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:11,620
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers.

3035
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:14,880
Or especially in the month of June.

3036
02:05:25,310 --> 02:05:26,090
Where are you?

3037
02:05:26,530 --> 02:05:27,950
We're like, I'm in the garden.

3038
02:05:28,130 --> 02:05:28,830
I'm trapped.

3039
02:05:29,050 --> 02:05:30,730
Wait, where are the flowers?

3040
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:31,730
I want to talk to the flowers.

3041
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:33,790
Go into the flower forest.

3042
02:05:33,950 --> 02:05:34,590
Oh, there they are.

3043
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:38,130
Oh, there they are.

3044
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:39,130
Look at them.

3045
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:41,970
Oh, where is the Mad Hatter place?

3046
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:43,270
Oh, you're right.

3047
02:05:45,110 --> 02:05:46,150
Oh, there's Alice.

3048
02:05:47,050 --> 02:05:47,310
Alice.

3049
02:05:48,090 --> 02:05:48,930
Did I find them?

3050
02:05:49,190 --> 02:05:49,670
Oh, I found it.

3051
02:05:51,670 --> 02:05:52,190
Where?

3052
02:05:53,690 --> 02:05:54,430
I found it.

3053
02:05:54,810 --> 02:05:55,690
It's a tea party.

3054
02:05:55,930 --> 02:05:57,050
It's next to the gardens.

3055
02:05:57,890 --> 02:05:59,470
What the hell is the gardens?

3056
02:06:00,190 --> 02:06:01,590
It's next to the flowers.

3057
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:02,710
Look up.

3058
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:03,730
Up?

3059
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:06,590
Look at me.

3060
02:06:09,310 --> 02:06:11,370
Do you remember?

3061
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:12,110
I remember.

3062
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:16,810
Okay, I need to talk.

3063
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:19,870
I don't know what you're going to say.

3064
02:06:20,290 --> 02:06:21,390
Holy shit.

3065
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:22,610
Sorry.

3066
02:06:30,530 --> 02:06:39,840
I didn't think the whole table would slip.

3067
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:40,760
Oh my god.

3068
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:42,460
You ruined their party.

3069
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:43,880
I ruined their party.

3070
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:44,820
I'm sorry.

3071
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:49,360
It's a low-rise table.

3072
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:49,960
It's fine.

3073
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:56,380
I'm so excited.

3074
02:06:56,620 --> 02:06:57,800
You must have a couple of these.

3075
02:06:58,260 --> 02:06:59,080
Clean cup.

3076
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:00,100
Move down.

3077
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:01,800
Move down.

3078
02:07:03,620 --> 02:07:04,560
Oh my god.

3079
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:05,680
That poor door mouse.

3080
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:07,600
Where is the door mouse?

3081
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:09,520
Oh my god.

3082
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:10,760
I didn't even see him in there.

3083
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:13,260
You ruined their unbirthday.

3084
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:14,660
It's his grave now.

3085
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:19,740
You don't even see him anymore.

3086
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:22,980
Goodbye, door mouse.

3087
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:25,200
Goodbye.

3088
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:25,940
We're sorry.

3089
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:27,360
Menace.

3090
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,240
I can't control my strength.

3091
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:32,660
I can't control my strength.

3092
02:07:32,660 --> 02:07:33,100
I can't control my strength.

3093
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,360
This is why...

3094
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:37,420
They closed the borders.

3095
02:07:37,880 --> 02:07:39,960
They didn't want us to come back.

3096
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:43,720
The other world heard about us.

3097
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:45,700
What's his name?

3098
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:47,660
Yeah, with the seashell people.

3099
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,700
We're the little children that he enslaved.

3100
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,000
Okay.

3101
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,140
Look.

3102
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:56,900
Oh wait, nevermind.

3103
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:58,720
Wait, there's the door.

3104
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,820
Wait, is this the door?

3105
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:00,580
What door?

3106
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:02,780
Oh, I'm late!

3107
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:05,340
I'm so late.

3108
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:07,020
Oh my god, I broke the door.

3109
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:09,700
Where are you?

3110
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:11,440
Where are you?

3111
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:13,460
I'm still by the tea house.

3112
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:14,480
Float up.

3113
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:16,220
Floating up.

3114
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:18,980
Float up.

3115
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:23,500
Go to the green forest.

3116
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:26,660
Where are you?

3117
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:28,220
Green forest.

3118
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:29,360
Oh, I see you.

3119
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:31,220
Right here.

3120
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:35,320
Come here.

3121
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:36,140
There's a rabbit.

3122
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:38,020
Oh, he's late for a very important date.

3123
02:08:38,020 --> 02:08:40,840
So this was originally like...

3124
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,440
Blocked up and I just...

3125
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:44,400
Fucking destroyed it.

3126
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:47,900
I was like...

3127
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:49,660
It's my world now.

3128
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:51,520
We can float on everything.

3129
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:53,940
I think that's how you start the world.

3130
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:54,460
Probably.

3131
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:57,260
Yeah, I think we fall down here.

3132
02:08:57,380 --> 02:08:59,080
And then we're gonna be like...

3133
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:00,920
Before they close the borders...

3134
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,560
I'm sorry.

3135
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:08,700
That's right.

3136
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:11,620
We're here to invade your land.

3137
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:14,820
They're like, oh god, don't give me...

3138
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:16,160
Shut it out!

3139
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:17,260
Shut everything down!

3140
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:20,060
I heard they snatched...

3141
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:22,380
The peace world out of existence.

3142
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:26,280
Wait, if you go back...

3143
02:09:26,280 --> 02:09:27,520
To the beast world, is there anything?

3144
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:29,560
Wait, how do we...

3145
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:30,480
Let's try...

3146
02:09:32,700 --> 02:09:33,500
Castle kitchen.

3147
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:35,340
Oh!

3148
02:09:36,340 --> 02:09:36,860
I'm here!

3149
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:38,360
Does it still exist?

3150
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,360
Everybody's gone though.

3151
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:43,260
There's no people.

3152
02:09:48,140 --> 02:09:49,440
Wait, they might be in the void!

3153
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:50,720
They might be in the void!

3154
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:51,580
I'm gonna go down!

3155
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:54,720
They might be in the void!

3156
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:56,720
I'm gonna go down!

3157
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:04,850
I think we killed them all!

3158
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:09,070
I think we killed them!

3159
02:10:09,410 --> 02:10:09,610
No!

3160
02:10:10,030 --> 02:10:11,450
Go to the village!

3161
02:10:12,410 --> 02:10:15,560
The gargoyles left!

3162
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:23,820
Now I know why they killed them.

3163
02:10:23,820 --> 02:10:25,960
Now I know...

3164
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:27,560
Oh my god, we're the beast!

3165
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:29,420
Oh my god, nobody's here!

3166
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:31,800
Nothing is here!

3167
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:36,060
Wait, horse fell out of the world!

3168
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:39,080
Wait, people are falling out of the world!

3169
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:44,280
Everybody got Thanos!

3170
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:48,800
Why is this door open?

3171
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:50,880
I don't know...

3172
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,300
I don't think it would...

3173
02:10:52,300 --> 02:10:53,340
I'm breaking it!

3174
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:57,460
Oh my god, it's so empty!

3175
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:58,800
Everybody's dead!

3176
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:02,820
I say bonjour, but no one says bonjour back!

3177
02:11:04,490 --> 02:11:04,920
Bonjour!

3178
02:11:06,770 --> 02:11:07,200
Bonjour!

3179
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:09,680
Bonjour!

3180
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:12,480
Bonjour!

3181
02:11:16,650 --> 02:11:18,730
It's a ghost village!

3182
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:20,770
It's a ghost village!

3183
02:11:20,770 --> 02:11:21,270
Wait for me!

3184
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:26,590
I'm gonna drown myself here for my sins!

3185
02:11:28,490 --> 02:11:31,210
Now I know why they closed the border!

3186
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:34,370
Oh, did you set the village on fire?

3187
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:39,010
Hide the evidence!

3188
02:11:40,390 --> 02:11:43,010
We gotta burn down the village!

3189
02:11:45,190 --> 02:11:49,550
50,000 people used to live here, now it's a ghost town!

3190
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:51,790
Why doesn't it work?

3191
02:11:53,050 --> 02:11:55,470
Oh, I don't think you can burn this part of the village.

3192
02:11:56,770 --> 02:11:58,310
You know, that's a good way to end.

3193
02:11:58,930 --> 02:12:01,230
You know, I think this is a good way to...

3194
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:02,930
To call it a year.

3195
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:03,910
Yeah, I think so.

3196
02:12:04,490 --> 02:12:06,150
You know, we should go to Disney World next.

3197
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:07,530
We won't break Disney World.

3198
02:12:14,410 --> 02:12:16,150
We'll do Disney World next time.

3199
02:12:16,170 --> 02:12:17,650
Yeah, we'll do Disney World next.

3200
02:12:17,650 --> 02:12:19,870
Yeah, we'll do Disney World next time, guys.

3201
02:12:20,010 --> 02:12:23,150
What a wonderful Disney adventure, everybody.

3202
02:12:25,390 --> 02:12:27,190
We wiped out...

3203
02:12:27,190 --> 02:12:29,750
We did what Kingdom Hearts couldn't.

3204
02:12:30,110 --> 02:12:34,850
We wiped all darkness away.

3205
02:12:35,650 --> 02:12:38,410
We wiped out the Disney World.

3206
02:12:38,770 --> 02:12:40,570
I can't believe that everybody's dead.

3207
02:12:41,950 --> 02:12:45,010
It's a wonder we got kicked out to Agrabah.

3208
02:12:45,010 --> 02:12:46,690
I know.

3209
02:12:47,530 --> 02:12:51,330
They deported us to Agrabah after what we did.

3210
02:12:52,390 --> 02:12:54,030
They're like, they'll die in the desert.

3211
02:12:58,010 --> 02:12:59,470
We did it.

3212
02:13:00,050 --> 02:13:01,190
We did it.

3213
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:02,370
We killed them all.

3214
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:03,370
We killed Belle.

3215
02:13:04,190 --> 02:13:05,870
And the Beast.

3216
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:07,490
That's right, Gaston.

3217
02:13:07,590 --> 02:13:08,490
We did it.

3218
02:13:09,150 --> 02:13:10,770
Put me in adventurer mode.

3219
02:13:11,470 --> 02:13:13,590
Alright, it's time we do it together.

3220
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:14,150
Yeah.

3221
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:16,510
For our sins.

3222
02:13:16,790 --> 02:13:17,630
For our sins.

3223
02:13:20,330 --> 02:13:22,170
Remember what we did, Mint.

3224
02:13:22,710 --> 02:13:23,490
I remember.

3225
02:13:24,450 --> 02:13:25,390
Do you remember?

3226
02:13:26,210 --> 02:13:27,350
I'll never forget.

3227
02:13:28,670 --> 02:13:29,930
I'm gonna do a flip.

3228
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:32,430
Do the Tetris dance.

3229
02:13:32,950 --> 02:13:34,770
Wait, can I Tetris Evo?

3230
02:13:38,610 --> 02:13:43,880
I think you did it.

3231
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:46,600
I think you did the Tetris Evo while we fell.

3232
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,920
You go first.

3233
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:56,100
I didn't fall very far.

3234
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:57,180
Me too.

3235
02:13:57,260 --> 02:13:58,520
We should've done it in the void.

3236
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:00,120
You know what?

3237
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:01,180
We can go to the void.

3238
02:14:01,420 --> 02:14:02,580
We actually can.

3239
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:04,180
Wait, I'm not dying.

3240
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:07,280
We can only die in the void.

3241
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:08,620
Okay, let's go die.

3242
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:09,740
I think it's this way.

3243
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:14,280
I think it's this way.

3244
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:23,420
This is how I wanna go.

3245
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:25,800
We're going all the way down.

3246
02:14:26,780 --> 02:14:28,100
Wait, is that not...

3247
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:29,840
I think we have to go down to go up.

3248
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:31,160
No, I see it.

3249
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:31,820
I found it.

3250
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:33,100
Alright.

3251
02:14:33,380 --> 02:14:34,640
I remember the hole you dug.

3252
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:36,940
I remember your sins.

3253
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:41,260
I was just trying to protect the village from Gaston.

3254
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:43,880
Wait, I wanna go to Gaston's hole.

3255
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:46,040
You go to this hole, I go to Gaston's hole.

3256
02:14:46,180 --> 02:14:48,880
And then we'll jump at the same time.

3257
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:50,200
Okay, I believe in us.

3258
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:51,000
Hold on, give me a second.

3259
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:51,720
I gotta run there.

3260
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:55,220
What a way to end it.

3261
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:00,580
We saw the horses die.

3262
02:15:00,820 --> 02:15:03,440
It said on the side they died out of the world.

3263
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:05,600
So I guess everybody else did too.

3264
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:07,360
I think...

3265
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:10,700
Alright, I'm ready.

3266
02:15:10,940 --> 02:15:11,640
I'm almost there.

3267
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:14,960
I'm almost there.

3268
02:15:14,980 --> 02:15:15,880
What a way to go.

3269
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:17,620
I'm almost there.

3270
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:19,200
I'm waiting.

3271
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:20,000
I'm waiting.

3272
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:23,380
Okay.

3273
02:15:24,140 --> 02:15:24,540
Ready?

3274
02:15:24,860 --> 02:15:29,600
3, 2, 1...

3275
02:15:38,510 --> 02:15:40,590
Do you see the minigame?

3276
02:15:41,330 --> 02:15:42,370
Wait, what?

3277
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:49,470
Respawn.

3278
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:51,410
Wait, wait, wait.

3279
02:15:51,650 --> 02:15:52,670
Come to my hole.

3280
02:15:56,890 --> 02:15:58,970
I think I found everybody.

3281
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:04,010
We have to go in creative mode.

3282
02:16:04,110 --> 02:16:05,190
We have to go in creative mode.

3283
02:16:07,770 --> 02:16:09,670
Are they all in the...

3284
02:16:09,670 --> 02:16:10,810
Come, come, come.

3285
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:15,590
Okay, alright, come on.

3286
02:16:16,850 --> 02:16:17,870
Oh my god.

3287
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:19,090
No way.

3288
02:16:19,590 --> 02:16:20,610
No way.

3289
02:16:23,550 --> 02:16:25,210
Can I just drop?

3290
02:16:28,030 --> 02:16:29,190
Oh my god.

3291
02:16:31,290 --> 02:16:33,010
What is this?

3292
02:16:36,550 --> 02:16:37,810
It's a party!

3293
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:39,250
I think...

3294
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:53,380
Because there is a book from the beginning.

3295
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:09,360
Wait, you are in the portal?

3296
02:17:09,580 --> 02:17:10,140
Oh my god.

3297
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:13,060
Where did you end up?

3298
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:15,500
It's just back in the town.

3299
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:16,760
No, I'm in Snow White.

3300
02:17:24,380 --> 02:17:26,060
She wants a hug.

3301
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,020
Oh my god.

3302
02:17:28,020 --> 02:17:28,160
Oh my god.

3303
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:30,580
I went to Snow White.

3304
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:34,240
Wow, what a great...

3305
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:35,860
What a way to end the collab.

3306
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:39,100
Well, we found out why it broke.

3307
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:42,480
We found out how we broke the game.

3308
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:50,980
Next time we'll go to Disneyland.

3309
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:52,100
Yay!

3310
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:55,920
Oh man, that was fun.

3311
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:57,320
Yeah, it was fun.

3312
02:17:58,060 --> 02:17:59,400
I hope you guys had fun too.

3313
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:03,180
I was like, this is where all the Disney characters go when they die.

3314
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:09,080
Don't let Mentor Jokey find you.

3315
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:16,920
You'll be sent to the Shadow Realm every time.

3316
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,420
We'll send you to the Shadow Realm.

3317
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:22,100
We'll send you to where the Heartless go.

3318
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:27,620
Oh my god.

3319
02:18:27,620 --> 02:18:31,500
Someone in super chat is like, I'm going to tell my kids that this was the real Kingdom Hearts.

3320
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:37,740
Yeah, this is the real Kingdom Hearts.

3321
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:40,540
This is how you only make one game for Kingdom Hearts.

3322
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:45,560
We get the job done.

3323
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:46,500
Yeah.

3324
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:48,800
We really did do a good job.

3325
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,180
GG's meant GG's.

3326
02:18:52,180 --> 02:18:54,360
Next time we'll do Disney World.

3327
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:56,300
Yeah, you can ride the rides in Disney.

3328
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:57,540
Yeah, I saw that.

3329
02:18:57,640 --> 02:18:59,460
And play the games at the rides too.

3330
02:18:59,540 --> 02:18:59,940
Yeah.

3331
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:02,620
We explored all the worlds.

3332
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:05,400
There's Snow White and Little Mermaid, right?

3333
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,780
Yeah, there's still Little Mermaid.

3334
02:19:08,140 --> 02:19:08,940
I forgot about that one.

3335
02:19:09,960 --> 02:19:13,200
To be fair, we got the fun ones.

3336
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:15,660
I think we did a pretty good job.

3337
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:19,540
Who cares about Snow White or Little Mermaid anyway?

3338
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:20,740
Who cares about them?

3339
02:19:21,140 --> 02:19:22,920
The water levels always suck.

3340
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:25,160
Because Snow White is a dumb bitch.

3341
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:28,600
What do you have against Snow White?

3342
02:19:29,140 --> 02:19:30,400
What did she do to you?

3343
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:32,040
Her movies are boring.

3344
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:33,540
Movies?

3345
02:19:33,780 --> 02:19:34,580
She has one!

3346
02:19:37,140 --> 02:19:39,560
Sorry, the next movie I can already tell.

3347
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:41,800
There's a live action.

3348
02:19:42,660 --> 02:19:44,280
To be fair, did you hear that line?

3349
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:46,360
The live action made a lot of movies.

3350
02:19:46,900 --> 02:19:47,820
Made a lot of money.

3351
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:50,120
The Brother one?

3352
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:50,540
Sonic.

3353
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:54,700
They made more money than Sonic.

3354
02:19:54,820 --> 02:19:55,040
No!

3355
02:19:56,920 --> 02:19:59,900
It's only because it's Disney.

3356
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:01,540
That's so true.

3357
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:02,700
No!

3358
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:04,260
I found the hole.

3359
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:06,520
I found the Gaston hole.

3360
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:10,540
Come see what you teleport to.

3361
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:12,160
It's a gacha.

3362
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:14,000
It's like a little gacha that we play.

3363
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:15,760
There it is.

3364
02:20:15,980 --> 02:20:17,960
Alright, where am I gonna go now?

3365
02:20:17,960 --> 02:20:19,820
Where's the evil queen?

3366
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,500
It's not teleporting me.

3367
02:20:24,660 --> 02:20:26,260
I'm in Snow White?

3368
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:28,640
Am I Snow White?

3369
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:29,960
Oh, I am in Snow White.

3370
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:33,840
There's the birds.

3371
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:36,980
I see the dark forest.

3372
02:20:37,920 --> 02:20:39,380
There's no evil queen.

3373
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:42,320
And there's no place where Snow White dies.

3374
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:46,720
To be fair, there wasn't even a place for Mufasa to die.

3375
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,260
No, they had the gorge!

3376
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:49,800
They had the gorge.

3377
02:20:50,180 --> 02:20:51,880
We had to create our own destiny.

3378
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:55,180
I see you, I see you.

3379
02:20:55,220 --> 02:20:55,620
I'm behind you.

3380
02:20:55,640 --> 02:20:56,880
I found the queen's castle.

3381
02:20:57,340 --> 02:20:58,520
Yeah, but she's not in here.

3382
02:20:58,540 --> 02:21:01,200
Maybe she's somewhere where she's making the potion.

3383
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:03,640
Oh, the evil area.

3384
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:05,280
Yeah, the evil lair.

3385
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:07,900
Maybe.

3386
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:13,060
We'll never know.

3387
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:14,240
I'm doing spectator mode.

3388
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:19,040
I'm finding the evil queen.

3389
02:21:19,140 --> 02:21:19,400
Okay.

3390
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:23,260
Game mode, spectator...

3391
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,660
There we go.

3392
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:30,140
Where are you?

3393
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:30,920
Wait, there's a dungeon!

3394
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:32,440
There's a dungeon?

3395
02:21:34,660 --> 02:21:36,160
Is she down here?

3396
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,720
No, she's not.

3397
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:39,300
How do you get in here?

3398
02:21:39,300 --> 02:21:40,880
I don't know, I just...

3399
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:41,720
I just zoomed.

3400
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:44,760
Oh wait, there's a little staircase.

3401
02:21:45,740 --> 02:21:46,800
Oh, there is.

3402
02:21:47,580 --> 02:21:48,520
X-ray on...

3403
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:49,040
I found her!

3404
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:51,280
She's here!

3405
02:21:53,140 --> 02:21:53,560
Look.

3406
02:21:54,580 --> 02:21:56,260
Oh my god!

3407
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:58,100
She's with the mirror!

3408
02:21:58,740 --> 02:22:01,620
Yeah, the mirror on the wall.

3409
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:03,460
Who's the dumbest of them all?

3410
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:05,820
He's looking at you.

3411
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:07,760
Ducky bird.

3412
02:22:17,380 --> 02:22:19,200
Okay, GG for real.

3413
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:22,100
Disney adventure that we had.

3414
02:22:22,380 --> 02:22:23,500
This was truly an adventure.

3415
02:22:23,980 --> 02:22:26,760
Truly an adventure that will tell our children...

3416
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:28,300
and our children's children...

3417
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:31,100
and Dragoon's children's children...

3418
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:31,380
What the hell, there's turtles?

3419
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:34,180
Yeah, this is the real Disney experience.

3420
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:36,140
This is the real Disney experience.

3421
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:38,020
This is the real Kingdom Hearts right here.

3422
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:40,720
Yeah, this is how I remember it, actually.

3423
02:22:41,100 --> 02:22:41,820
I know, me too.

3424
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:43,920
A flower forest?

3425
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:46,300
Where did Snow White die?

3426
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:48,740
Um...

3427
02:22:48,740 --> 02:22:49,860
She died...

3428
02:22:49,860 --> 02:22:52,320
Well, she like, eats the apple...

3429
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:54,560
and then I think she falls off the cliff...

3430
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:56,400
and then she's put in the glass case.

3431
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:58,400
Oh, I found the mines.

3432
02:22:58,980 --> 02:22:59,340
Hi-ho!

3433
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:00,600
Hi-ho!

3434
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:01,160
Hi-ho!

3435
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:08,460
There's words there?

3436
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:09,740
No.

3437
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:13,400
That's how I remember it.

3438
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:16,700
Wait, why don't they use...

3439
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:18,600
actual Minecraft, like...

3440
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:20,060
Ores.

3441
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:20,840
Where's diamonds?

3442
02:23:21,380 --> 02:23:22,480
Where the fuck is diamonds?

3443
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:24,020
They're not making any money.

3444
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:26,500
I like how the little...

3445
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:28,600
gemmies in this world look like the...

3446
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:29,940
thing from The Sims.

3447
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:32,900
Oh my God, there they are.

3448
02:23:33,400 --> 02:23:35,380
Oh my God, they're huge!

3449
02:23:36,380 --> 02:23:37,800
I found the dwarves!

3450
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:40,380
Why are the dwarves as big as Snow White?

3451
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:41,180
Where are they?

3452
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:42,860
Go to the...

3453
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:44,280
slash TP.

3454
02:23:44,780 --> 02:23:47,620
There, look.

3455
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:50,200
They're just as big...

3456
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:52,900
They're just as big as Snow White.

3457
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:53,380
Holy...

3458
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:55,900
Oh my God, the bird's trying to escape out of fear.

3459
02:23:55,900 --> 02:23:57,900
They're like...

3460
02:23:58,480 --> 02:23:58,900
Let me out!

3461
02:23:59,100 --> 02:23:59,500
Let me out!

3462
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:01,900
Wait, that means...

3463
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:04,240
I was like, why is his nose doing that?

3464
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:08,120
Oh my God, they have different lengths of noses.

3465
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:10,200
Look, it's not about...

3466
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:12,340
the size of the nose, it's how you use it.

3467
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:13,960
Which one's the real one?

3468
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:17,700
Wait, he's bigger than you.

3469
02:24:17,860 --> 02:24:19,780
This is the first time he's bigger.

3470
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:21,240
Oh my God!

3471
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:24,240
Yeah, why are the dwarves bigger?

3472
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:26,120
Is it because I'm in the ground?

3473
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:27,660
No, you're...

3474
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:30,500
No, they're still bigger than you.

3475
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:31,100
Where are you?

3476
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:32,900
I'm here.

3477
02:24:33,460 --> 02:24:36,060
You're invisible to me.

3478
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:38,640
Oh no.

3479
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:41,140
Are you in the house?

3480
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:42,080
Yeah.

3481
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:45,520
Oh well.

3482
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:48,280
The bird just opened the door and flew inside.

3483
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:51,100
Oh, that's you?

3484
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:51,940
Yeah.

3485
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:53,800
You're the bird?

3486
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:56,860
No, I opened the door and the bird came in.

3487
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,480
It looked like the bird opened it.

3488
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:05,060
I thought you turned into a bird.

3489
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:07,400
Oh my God, Morty.

3490
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:08,820
Look, I turned into a bird.

3491
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:12,140
I'm Doki Bird!

3492
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:13,480
I'm Doki Bird!

3493
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:15,340
Look Morty!

3494
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:17,340
The funniest shit in the world!

3495
02:25:17,900 --> 02:25:19,280
I'm Doki Bird!

3496
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:21,740
Okay, I'm gonna...

3497
02:25:21,740 --> 02:25:22,660
I guess that's it then.

3498
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:24,680
GG.

3499
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:26,260
GG's, man.

3500
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:27,460
Have a great time.

3501
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:29,680
Next time, let's do this again soon.

3502
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:30,020
Yeah.

3503
02:25:30,060 --> 02:25:30,880
And go to Disney World.

3504
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:34,580
Yeah, and let's not destroy Disney World.

3505
02:25:34,780 --> 02:25:36,020
I mean, we could.

3506
02:25:36,480 --> 02:25:37,880
We could destroy it.

3507
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:38,740
You know, at the end.

3508
02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:41,580
Oh yeah!

3509
02:25:42,580 --> 02:25:45,600
We should go into creative when the fireworks are about to go off.

3510
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:47,460
And then put a lot of TNT everywhere.

3511
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:55,060
If we go underground, you think we'll see Walt Disney Frozen?

3512
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:56,620
Oh my God, you're right!

3513
02:25:56,840 --> 02:25:58,640
We'll see Walt Disney Frozen.

3514
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:01,660
Cryogenic Chamber.

3515
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:02,060
Yeah!

3516
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:04,700
We'll see his head down there.

3517
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:13,180
GG's, man.

3518
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:14,060
GG's.

3519
02:26:14,060 --> 02:26:15,240
I'll see you next week.

3520
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:16,680
Next week?

3521
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:19,100
Oh yeah, that's right.

3522
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:20,220
Surprise!

3523
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:22,780
Next week we have another collab.

3524
02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:23,420
Another collab!

3525
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:25,580
With the Sloppy Sisters.

3526
02:26:28,040 --> 02:26:29,940
See you next week, man.

3527
02:26:30,140 --> 02:26:31,160
Okay, see you next week!

3528
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:33,040
Bye bye, GG!

3529
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:34,500
Bye bye, GG!

3530
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:38,580
Oh wait.

3531
02:26:39,020 --> 02:26:40,420
Are you gonna go talk to your chat?

3532
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:41,280
I'm still on screen.

3533
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,840
Just really fast.

3534
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:44,740
Just gonna say bye.

3535
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:47,180
Oh, you're gonna talk to your chat?

3536
02:26:47,380 --> 02:26:48,460
Yeah, just fast.

3537
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:50,680
GG's, bye bye!

3538
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:56,500
Oh, she sent me that video.

3539
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:59,180
Markiplier reacts to Ruben's death.

3540
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:00,780
Is this the pig you were talking about?

3541
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:06,380
Oh, there's Doki.

3542
02:27:13,610 --> 02:27:19,650
I can't emote in spectator.

3543
02:27:23,450 --> 02:27:24,710
Let me emote!

3544
02:27:25,490 --> 02:27:26,730
Let me emote!

3545
02:27:27,010 --> 02:27:28,010
Let me emote!

3546
02:27:28,290 --> 02:27:29,470
Oh, okay, cool.

3547
02:27:55,710 --> 02:27:56,790
Of course!

3548
02:27:57,290 --> 02:27:58,290
Get out of the way!

3549
02:27:59,450 --> 02:28:01,910
Oh my gosh, we lost all our items!

3550
02:28:02,570 --> 02:28:03,570
Wait, so...

3551
02:28:03,570 --> 02:28:05,130
Wait, wait...

3552
02:28:05,130 --> 02:28:07,410
Did you also lose...

3553
02:28:07,410 --> 02:28:08,330
all your items?

3554
02:28:11,670 --> 02:28:13,120
This is why it's so stucky.

3555
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:17,370
Wait, are we actually stuck here?

3556
02:28:23,830 --> 02:28:24,590
Juan...

3557
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:25,190
Yeah?

3558
02:28:27,690 --> 02:28:28,450
We...

3559
02:28:28,810 --> 02:28:30,990
can't go back to the hub.

3560
02:28:35,050 --> 02:28:36,710
How'd she leave the realm?

3561
02:28:37,110 --> 02:28:38,130
Oh, she left the realm.

3562
02:28:38,130 --> 02:28:38,190
The realm.

3563
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:43,490
Wait a second.

3564
02:28:45,170 --> 02:28:45,970
Wasn't the...

3565
02:28:46,430 --> 02:28:48,070
The entrance was...

3566
02:28:48,070 --> 02:28:48,870
Oh, here, here, here.

3567
02:28:48,970 --> 02:28:49,950
Maybe we can go back.

3568
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:51,590
Is this the entrance?

3569
02:28:53,570 --> 02:28:54,930
Oh, Mr. Cute Jaguar.

3570
02:28:55,850 --> 02:28:56,670
Also, thank you, maid.

3571
02:28:57,110 --> 02:28:57,510
What?

3572
02:28:58,810 --> 02:28:59,210
Maid.

3573
02:28:59,590 --> 02:29:00,430
Thank you, maid.

3574
02:29:00,930 --> 02:29:01,630
Oh, hey Doki.

3575
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:03,570
I went back.

3576
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:11,010
Why'd she keep joining and leaving?

3577
02:29:11,730 --> 02:29:13,690
I just wanted to look around just a little bit more.

3578
02:29:14,850 --> 02:29:16,390
This world is actually...

3579
02:29:16,390 --> 02:29:17,570
Even though we...

3580
02:29:17,570 --> 02:29:19,170
broke all of it, it's actually...

3581
02:29:19,170 --> 02:29:20,150
Come on, seriously?

3582
02:29:20,270 --> 02:29:21,230
You won't let us go in here?

3583
02:29:23,430 --> 02:29:26,390
Only YouTube can break a world that was designed for kids.

3584
02:29:26,610 --> 02:29:27,870
Makes it a fun stream.

3585
02:29:28,190 --> 02:29:29,450
I hope you guys had fun!

3586
02:29:31,370 --> 02:29:32,230
Oh my god.

3587
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:33,790
What's going on over here?

3588
02:29:34,650 --> 02:29:36,150
What's going on over here?

3589
02:29:36,150 --> 02:29:37,350
Oh, okay.

3590
02:29:37,430 --> 02:29:38,230
It just didn't load in.

3591
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:40,390
I was like, what else did we break?

3592
02:29:41,530 --> 02:29:43,310
I hope you guys had fun!

3593
02:29:44,810 --> 02:29:45,370
And...

3594
02:29:45,370 --> 02:29:47,230
Oh, there's silly antics.

3595
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:49,010
Truly...

3596
02:29:49,010 --> 02:29:51,510
Truly a Doki Mint adventure.

3597
02:29:52,930 --> 02:29:54,050
A genuine...

3598
02:29:54,050 --> 02:29:56,570
Genuine bonafide adventure.

3599
02:29:58,350 --> 02:30:01,030
I'm going to call you guys Organization 2.

3600
02:30:06,150 --> 02:30:08,530
I was... I cried so much from this.

3601
02:30:08,650 --> 02:30:09,310
Not gonna lie.

3602
02:30:09,530 --> 02:30:11,550
I was literally in tears.

3603
02:30:12,270 --> 02:30:12,590
Laughing.

3604
02:30:13,290 --> 02:30:15,570
Especially at the...

3605
02:30:15,910 --> 02:30:18,270
Especially with the magic carpet ride.

3606
02:30:20,650 --> 02:30:22,230
Glad for all your adventures.

3607
02:30:23,790 --> 02:30:25,210
Thank you guys!

3608
02:30:25,770 --> 02:30:27,890
And enjoy the rest of your...

3609
02:30:27,890 --> 02:30:30,130
Night, evening, whatever time it is for you.

3610
02:30:30,330 --> 02:30:30,810
Tomorrow!

3611
02:30:32,010 --> 02:30:32,930
Is Valentine's Day.

3612
02:30:32,930 --> 02:30:35,870
And I'm not done with my...

3613
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:36,810
Making my stream yet.

3614
02:30:36,910 --> 02:30:37,590
I'm nervous.

3615
02:30:38,950 --> 02:30:40,290
Because I still have to...

3616
02:30:40,290 --> 02:30:42,590
I have literally everything to record.

3617
02:30:42,930 --> 02:30:44,610
I forgot to record that one thing today.

3618
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:45,670
Oh no.

3619
02:30:46,590 --> 02:30:48,510
Maybe I'll have time to do it tomorrow.

3620
02:30:48,750 --> 02:30:49,390
Oh my gosh.

3621
02:30:52,450 --> 02:30:53,870
Just a little disclaimer.

3622
02:30:57,090 --> 02:30:58,930
It might be a little...

3623
02:30:58,930 --> 02:31:00,330
Spookier than...

3624
02:31:02,930 --> 02:31:03,390
People anticipate.

3625
02:31:04,110 --> 02:31:05,610
I even put like a disclaimer.

3626
02:31:05,810 --> 02:31:08,750
Because I feel like the last time I did a spooky stream...

3627
02:31:08,750 --> 02:31:09,930
People were like...

3628
02:31:09,930 --> 02:31:11,250
It's kind of scary.

3629
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:14,510
So I was just like...

3630
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:15,810
You know, just in case.

3631
02:31:17,550 --> 02:31:19,090
There's no jump scares or anything.

3632
02:31:19,710 --> 02:31:20,870
But it might be a little...

3633
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:22,010
Spookier for some people.

3634
02:31:25,010 --> 02:31:25,450
So...

3635
02:31:25,450 --> 02:31:27,410
It's summoning a ghost after all, right?

3636
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:29,850
But yeah.

3637
02:31:29,850 --> 02:31:30,370
Okay.

3638
02:31:31,930 --> 02:31:32,530
Wow.

3639
02:31:33,050 --> 02:31:36,150
Oh my gosh, this is just like the library of everything...

3640
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:38,010
Of the world that sent us to hell.

3641
02:31:38,890 --> 02:31:40,810
Where it all went wrong.

3642
02:31:43,850 --> 02:31:45,450
Oh god, I'm Dumbo.

3643
02:31:45,810 --> 02:31:46,510
What's his name?

3644
02:31:47,450 --> 02:31:48,050
Daffy.

3645
02:31:49,710 --> 02:31:51,050
What's this guy's name?

3646
02:31:52,430 --> 02:31:53,030
Silly?

3647
02:31:54,850 --> 02:31:55,450
Dopey.

3648
02:31:55,450 --> 02:31:55,870
What are you doing?

3649
02:31:58,690 --> 02:31:59,170
Doki?

3650
02:32:02,150 --> 02:32:02,630
Dumpy.

3651
02:32:04,910 --> 02:32:05,810
Where are you?

3652
02:32:06,090 --> 02:32:07,630
When are you beating Minecraft Hardcore...

3653
02:32:08,090 --> 02:32:08,770
Into modem mode?

3654
02:32:09,010 --> 02:32:09,590
Oh my gosh, dude.

3655
02:32:11,010 --> 02:32:13,670
His favorite struggle part of this collab...

3656
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:14,790
Was you two...

3657
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:17,790
