1
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,330
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

2
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,910
Welcome to Shashingo!

3
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,350
What's the pun?

4
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,390
On... Shashin?

5
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,050
On Nihongo.

6
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,030
Shashingo.

7
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,040
Or if it's Shashingo, wouldn't it be like photography language?

8
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,220
Teach us Nihongo!

9
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,820
Today...

10
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,980
Today, I would like to play a game to learn Japanese!

11
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,080
In this game, you take pictures of people.

12
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,800
And you learn Japanese.

13
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,700
Let's all be weebs together.

14
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,860
Nihongo Jouzu.

15
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,300
Mito-chan, Nihongo Jouzu.

16
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,800
That's not true.

17
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,640
Thank you very much.

18
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,700
The weather is nice, isn't it?

19
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,860
Wow, you're really good.

20
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,960
No, no, not yet.

21
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
No, no, no.

22
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,500
Nani?

23
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,800
My Nihongo is very sugoi.

24
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,740
I believe you.

25
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,240
I believe you.

26
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,900
Actually, yesterday...

27
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,940
Was it yesterday?

28
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,180
Yes.

29
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,120
Yesterday, Matara and I, we both bought our...

30
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,280
Our...

31
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,620
Oh, sorry.

32
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,960
Something fell on my desk.

33
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,760
Our tickets to Japan!

34
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,420
So before...

35
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,580
Oh, I can read Kanji.

36
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,920
Sugoi.

37
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,720
Kanji...

38
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,740
I can't read Kanji.

39
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,500
No, no, no, no.

40
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,620
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

41
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,860
Ore no Nihongo!

42
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,800
Yeah, we bought our tickets to Japan.

43
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,980
So now it feels so much more real.

44
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,080
But...

45
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,860
Oh my gosh, this music is going to put me to sleep.

46
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:42,960
Um...

47
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,600
Um...

48
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,960
Um...

49
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,940
Uh...

50
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,680
What was I going to say?

51
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,360
It was so funny when we were buying them.

52
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,380
We were buying them together.

53
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,360
And I bought mine.

54
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,380
I ended up like...

55
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:55,980
Fin...

56
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,680
Like I ended up putting in all of my information first.

57
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,920
And buying my ticket first.

58
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,340
And then she goes to buy hers.

59
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,340
And we got ours separately.

60
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,640
But...

61
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,180
Um...

62
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,060
We put our seats next to each other.

63
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,360
And...

64
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,900
Um...

65
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,140
And...

66
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,540
Uh...

67
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,240
When she went to go buy hers, it said that it was sold out.

68
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,380
So I was like...

69
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,580
I didn't take it.

70
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,320
I didn't take it.

71
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,320
I didn't take...

72
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,860
Um...

73
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,660
But in the end, it worked out.

74
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,600
It was pretty...

75
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
It was too slow.

76
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,200
And I took her seat.

77
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,940
Japan is so hot.

78
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,600
Well...

79
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,640
It's hot here too.

80
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,400
It's hot in Mint too.

81
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,760
Oh!

82
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,020
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

83
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,640
I like the lo-fi of this.

84
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,480
I really wanted like a kind of chill game.

85
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,400
And uh...

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,460
Um...

87
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,940
Something that...

88
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:00,980
Uh...

89
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,800
Uh...

90
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:02,940
Uh...

91
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
Do you know Riiiguma?

92
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,560
Riiiguma!

93
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,360
Riiiguma!

94
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,360
Riiiiguma!

95
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,500
Ummm...

96
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,760
Ummmm...

97
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,440
What's his name?

98
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:15,900
Oh no.

99
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,100
Uhhh...

100
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,020
Uhhhh...

101
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,140
Ummm...

102
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,540
Oh!

103
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
Steve Jobs!

104
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,080
Who's this?

105
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,200
Riiiguma is...

106
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,740
an English meme.

107
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,420
It's an English meme.

108
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,060
Don't worry about it.

109
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:38,940
Please.

110
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,260
Who is Steve Jobs?

111
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,160
We can study...

112
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,000
Your Japanese is really good.

113
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,940
Thank you.

114
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,700
Today is actually my birthday so I can ask for a happy birthday from Porsche Red.

115
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,260
Oh my gosh, happy birthday!

116
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,280
Happy birthday to you.

117
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,460
Oh, happy birthday to you.

118
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,880
Happy birthday, David Titanium PP.

119
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,400
Happy birthday...

120
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,840
to you.

121
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,420
You little...

122
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,340
peasant.

123
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,210
Your Japanese is good.

124
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,010
Thank you.

125
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,570
I'm looking forward to a photo tour with Mint.

126
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,370
Thank you.

127
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,150
Hi Mint.

128
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:07,670
Hello.

129
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,930
Hi ViviCore.

130
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,210
Posh voice Jozu.

131
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,550
Everything is Jozu.

132
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,750
And not everything can be Jozu.

133
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,750
Not everything can be Jozu.

134
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,850
Let's do it again.

135
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,390
Japan has over five mil...

136
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:27,670
Oh.

137
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,730
Oh my god, it's so loud.

138
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,390
It's raining!

139
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,470
Welcome to Shashingo.

140
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,490
Here you'll use your camera to create unique photo flashcards for learning Japanese.

141
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,390
You're free to explore your surroundings and study at your own pace without any pressure.

142
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,650
Oh, in-world translations.

143
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,770
Besides learning new vocabulary with your camera, you'll also come across Japanese text in various places while exploring.

144
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,950
Interacting with the text will allow you to view the original Japanese text along with the translation.

145
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,210
Oh my gosh!

146
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,990
I can't hear you over the sounds of Japan.

147
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,390
Five million what?

148
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,890
Five million!

149
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,650
Five million!

150
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,290
I'm looking forward to Shashingo.

151
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,490
Also, I can read the kanji.

152
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,310
A little bit.

153
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,250
I can read it.

154
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,790
I'll give you this joke.

155
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,110
Wait, I'll give this joke one more try before retiring.

156
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,470
How do Japanese pirates apologize?

157
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,230
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,160
What?

159
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,580
What?

160
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:45,960
Wait.

161
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,880
Huh?

162
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
Oh my gosh, it's so quiet because...

163
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,680
Hold on.

164
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm gonna get through...

165
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,500
Let me get through this real quick and then I'll turn the sound down.

166
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,160
Open your camera when you're ready.

167
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,040
Learn how to use it.

168
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,800
Okay, hold on.

169
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:12,700
Made...

170
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,620
Made dreaming!

171
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,220
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,120
Made melody.

173
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,860
Okay, audio.

174
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,480
There we go.

175
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,920
Oh my god, peace.

176
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,400
This is like going to real Japan.

177
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,300
This is like real...

178
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,920
This is like going to real...

179
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,820
Wow, the first thing we see is a main campaign.

180
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Oh my gosh.

181
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,180
Made...

182
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,360
Made melody.

183
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Made melody.

184
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,640
Oh my gosh.

185
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,540
Very good.

186
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,700
Where are we?

187
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,700
I wonder.

188
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,760
I wonder where we are.

189
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Oh wait, how do I...

190
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,620
Oh, right click is...

191
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,920
Watashitachi no natsu no yoru.

192
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,440
Rainbow team.

193
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,020
Hey, that's not Nihongo.

194
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,780
That's not Nihongo.

195
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,640
Let's see.

196
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,880
What do we...

197
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,260
Let's take a picture of the maids.

198
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,360
Oh, operating the camera.

199
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,200
Operating the camera is easy and there are only a few buttons to remember.

200
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,440
To take a photo, simply frame your subject by adjusting your position, angle and zoom.

201
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,360
Then press the shutter button when you're ready.

202
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,520
Oh, I'm so excited.

203
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,740
Oh, there's filters.

204
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,440
Oh, wow.

205
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,080
Tsuki ga kirei desu ne.

206
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,880
Oh my gosh.

207
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,320
You'll get kicked out if you take a picture of the maids.

208
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,800
You're so right.

209
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,600
Don't take pictures of the maids, you guys.

210
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,180
While it's not mandatory, holding the shutter button allows you to lock up...

211
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,980
Lock on.

212
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,660
I'm lock...

213
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,540
Lock on.

214
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,380
You can adjust the composition even more freely.

215
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,800
Release the shutter button.

216
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,500
Okay.

217
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,560
Oh, releasing the shutter button will then take the picture.

218
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,460
Framing the subject correctly.

219
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh, look at that.

220
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,940
You can make it look so much better.

221
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,080
Your subject needs to fill a good portion of the frame to be recognized by the camera.

222
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,100
Genji!

223
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,200
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

224
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,720
Thank you.

225
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,020
As long as the viewfinder displays...

226
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,800
Or Japanese word, you can freely take a photo.

227
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:23,940
Okay.

228
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay.

229
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,800
Well, this one.

230
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,100
Let's see.

231
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,540
What is maid melody?

232
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:33,820
Kasha!

233
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,480
Kanban.

234
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:36,740
Kanban!

235
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,680
Oh my gosh!

236
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,840
They're not maids at all!

237
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,860
They're a signboard!

238
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:40,860
Oh my gosh.

239
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,380
I recognize all of this from Irastoya.

240
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,140
Kanban!

241
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,500
Nice photo!

242
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,360
You just made your first photo flashcard.

243
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,200
As you can see, the subject of the photo was written on it in Japanese along with the translation.

244
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,520
Flipping it will also reveal an additional related message.

245
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,540
I don't know what they have to do with the kanban but...

246
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,800
Kanban!

247
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,920
We have a photo album.

248
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,940
We can get star stickers.

249
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,380
As you master words, they'll also receive star stickers.

250
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,900
Marking your favorite.

251
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,340
In-game lessons?

252
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:42,700
Wow!

253
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh!

254
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,700
Whoa!

255
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,540
It's night time!

256
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,300
Uh-oh, I hope no creepers come out.

257
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,120
Let's see this one.

258
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,660
Let's see this one.

259
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,020
What do you guys think this is?

260
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,520
Don't say it.

261
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,360
This is Sakurai Station.

262
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,660
The moon's out?

263
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,300
Wait, how do I get out of camera mode?

264
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,080
Oh, you're right!

265
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,600
Zoom.

266
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,820
Lock on!

267
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,280
Moon!

268
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,940
Moon!

269
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,820
What's the...

270
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
Night.

271
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,780
Night.

272
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,000
Cold weather.

273
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,800
Yeah.

274
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,240
You don't eat something and say it's cold.

275
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,080
You say it's cold.

276
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,860
Karaoke.

277
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,300
Wait, why is the question mark here?

278
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,140
Oh!

279
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,920
It's the whole karaoke?

280
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,460
Karaoke.

281
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,720
Karaoke.

282
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,320
Karaoke.

283
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:53,640
Sing!

284
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:55,780
Wow!

285
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm happy!

286
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,440
Got to see my best friend.

287
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,720
Got offered a new job.

288
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,600
I have been streaming...

289
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,160
Oh, my birthday!

290
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,340
Cooper!

291
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,720
Happy birthday!

292
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,020
Happy birthday to you!

293
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,820
Happy birthday to you!

294
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,540
Happy birthday Cooper White!

295
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,120
Happy birthday to you!

296
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,280
Happy birthday to you!

297
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,880
Woooooooo!

298
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,540
Happy birthday!

299
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,860
Oh, testing your memory.

300
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,240
Find mode puts your memory to the test to reinforce your vocabulary knowledge.

301
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,060
You'll be given one of the Japanese words from your photo flashcards and tasked with photographer...

302
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,000
Photography-ing...

303
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,760
Photo...

304
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,460
Photographing!

305
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,100
Photographing it in the game world!

306
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:52,780
Hahaha...

307
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,920
Cool...

308
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,660
Word mastery...

309
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,440
And we can get new fi- Oh my gosh, there's gacha too.

310
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,720
Oh, heck yeah.

311
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,520
Students are 10% off.

312
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,360
What's this?

313
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,140
Advertisement.

314
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,840
Advertisement!

315
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:15,980
Advertisement.

316
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,820
Poster.

317
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,340
Chigaimasu.

318
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:19,900
Oh!

319
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,540
Sendensuru.

320
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,840
To advertise.

321
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,320
Yuko.

322
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,180
Effective.

323
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,240
Miryokuteki.

324
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,220
Appealing.

325
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,200
Oh my gosh.

326
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,500
When you see...

327
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,180
When you see a mint channel, you're like...

328
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:37,280
Oh!

329
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,140
Wow, miryokutekina channel.

330
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,600
Oh, I should douroku right now.

331
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,580
Oh, I can't do these though.

332
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,380
Thank you!

333
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,340
Thank you!

334
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,580
Tsuki ga kirei desu ne.

335
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,640
Oh wait, Joshua, I missed yours too.

336
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,040
I'm so sorry.

337
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,940
Good day to you, mint.

338
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,340
I hope you are having a wonderful day.

339
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,660
Wonderful minty day.

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,720
Thank you!

341
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,160
Have you ever watched any films in the gai- gaiyou genre?

342
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,180
I don't know if I have.

343
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,460
I hope I said it right.

344
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,220
Hahaha...

345
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,660
Oh...

346
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,320
Uh...

347
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,340
Shashinto kawaii obake...

348
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,060
Maido...

349
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,660
Oh, meido.

350
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,740
Wait, wait.

351
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,900
Maido?

352
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,800
Mai...

353
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,080
Wait.

354
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,520
Oh, is it meido?

355
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,240
How was my broken nihongo sensei?

356
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,120
It's good.

357
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,900
Don't worry about it.

358
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,540
Let's take his picture.

359
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,380
Oh!

360
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,480
Which one do we...

361
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,500
Do I hear someone singing in here?

362
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,200
Hold on.

363
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,320
There's voice lines?

364
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,520
I think I hear a ghost in here.

365
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,880
Oh!

366
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,360
You hear it?

367
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,620
What are they singing?

368
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,610
It was a lady singing before.

369
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,430
She was like...

370
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,630
Shashin ghost.

371
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,430
That's why...

372
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,410
My...

373
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,770
It was my art tag.

374
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,990
But my general tag is...

375
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,090
Shinrei shashin.

376
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,890
Which means like spirit photography.

377
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,170
Hahaha...

378
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,610
Interesting.

379
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,810
Oh my god.

380
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,010
Sorry.

381
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,590
I'm so sorry.

382
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,440
Konnichiwa.

383
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:52,980
Konnichiwa.

384
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Wait, what did you say?

385
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,420
Do you watch anime desu ka?

386
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,760
Na sugoi desu.

387
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,140
Watashi wa I'm learning Japanese.

388
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,400
Through all the anime watashi watches desu.

389
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,380
Watashi love talking about anime.

390
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,360
X3.

391
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,480
X3.

392
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,060
Na so uu.

393
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,300
Have a konbanwa!

394
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,720
Have a konbanwa.

395
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,660
Everybody.

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
Wow, we stayed up all night in front of this karaoke place.

397
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,140
Is this...

398
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,750
Is this shizen?

399
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,550
Oh, gosh.

400
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,210
My kanji.

401
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,770
Mira yo.

402
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:34,670
tsuku...

403
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,390
Is it tsukui suru no wa?

404
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:43,190
This is just... I don't know... I can't read it.

405
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,070
It's just a mecha.

406
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,890
I'm going back to nature.

407
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,030
To watch.

408
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:09,730
Engidu.

409
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,090
To perform.

410
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,490
Kando teki.

411
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,610
Moving.

412
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,430
It was my birthday yesterday.

413
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,450
I had a fun, low quality, high latency discord karaoke session with my friends and watched Dune 2.

414
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,270
Is that the one with the...

415
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,950
Is that the one... Oh, she didn't tell me.

416
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,810
Is that the one with the popcorn?

417
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,150
To Chonky.

418
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,550
Also, happy birthday!

419
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,230
Happy birthday to you.

420
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,310
Happy birthday to you.

421
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,790
Happy birthday to Chonky.

422
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,610
Happy birthday to you.

423
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,490
Wait, do I just click it?

424
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:49,670
Oh!

425
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,830
The only way to save the future is to live.

426
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,250
Only one mecha.

427
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,230
Live.

428
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,610
Live.

429
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,850
Only one mech can save the future.

430
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,330
Future world.

431
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,110
Future... Oh, I didn't even see the three.

432
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,450
Future world three.

433
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,630
Shizen ni modoru.

434
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,670
Return to nature.

435
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,730
Happy Eiga.

436
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,770
Rainbow team.

437
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,230
Rescue... Oh, it does say rescue mission.

438
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,510
I was like, it just says rainbow team, rainbow team.

439
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,970
Space.

440
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,870
Komanda.

441
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,610
Kinta?

442
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:43,710
Kinda?

443
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,450
Oh, Kaneda- Kaneda-kun.

444
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,290
Oh shit, this is just going to make me look so stupid.

445
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,330
I'm really bad with kanji, you guys.

446
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
Kaneda-kun.

447
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,180
Kanjin, doushite?

448
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,640
Onyomi-kun yomi muzukashisukeru yomenai.

449
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,560
Pinku no sora no shitade.

450
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,080
Under a pink sky.

451
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,900
Under a pink sky.

452
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,240
This is the iriguchi.

453
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,780
Your entrance.

454
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,240
Oh, I can't read the... Okay.

455
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,300
I can read the Eiga-kan.

456
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,040
Is it raku?

457
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,060
Something...

458
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,560
Raku...

459
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,600
Go-raku?

460
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,720
Entertainment cinema.

461
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,720
Oh, go-raku ega-kan.

462
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,160
Go-raku, go-raku, go-raku.

463
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,720
Go-raku, go-raku, go-raku.

464
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,480
Whoa!

465
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,760
Oh my gosh!

466
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,760
Guitar star!

467
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,640
Boo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

468
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,240
Boo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

469
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,200
Boo-doo-doo-doo.

470
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,680
She's got a smile that seems to me.

471
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,840
Reminds me of childhood memories.

472
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,460
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky.

473
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,360
Guitar star.

474
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,860
Wow, I feel like this is actually so helpful because it like...

475
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,360
Actually kind of shows you things like...

476
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,520
That you would really see in like...

477
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,300
In a context that you would see it.

478
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,600
Hanabi taikai!

479
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,300
Wait, can you read that?

480
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,740
Maybe you have to zoom in.

481
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,570
Sora.

482
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,470
That's the skin.

483
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:38,990
No!

484
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,770
No!

485
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:43,750
Sora.

486
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,030
Akarue.

487
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,490
Kaze.

488
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,310
Kumori.

489
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,090
Beautiful.

490
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,530
Wait, so if I take a picture of...

491
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,770
Oh, whoa, this is big.

492
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,390
Is it just ega-kan?

493
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,270
Ega-kan.

494
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,970
Ega-kan, everybody.

495
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,050
Miru.

496
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,370
I'm going for a date?

497
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,690
Did someone say the door detectors?

498
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,390
D-d-d-date?

499
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,580
Haku-ryoku.

500
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,400
Impact.

501
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,420
Date.

502
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,680
Good thing you'll never need to know that.

503
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,620
I wonder how big this map is.

504
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,980
I know what it says.

505
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,100
It lasts 48 hours.

506
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,880
Natural scent that lasts 48 hours.

507
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,800
I can't read it though.

508
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,540
That's the thing about kanji that I do like sometimes.

509
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,320
This is like the kanji for tsuzukeru.

510
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,780
And the kanji for... Sorry, my brain.

511
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,180
But I can't read them together.

512
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,120
But I know what they are separately.

513
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:23,080
So it already means... I can already make an educated guess.

514
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,960
I've already dated all your oshiminto.

515
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,600
Who?

516
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,860
Who have you dated?

517
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,880
Tell me right now.

518
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,080
Tell me the date.

519
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,200
Tell me the time.

520
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,340
Tell me everything that you did.

521
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,800
Tell me their natural scent.

522
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,100
Tell me what they wore.

523
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,500
Tell me how they did their hair.

524
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,940
Tell me the color of their eyes.

525
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,100
Tell me what they said.

526
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,760
The first thing that they said when they saw you.

527
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Tell me everything.

528
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,390
That's what I thought.

529
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,150
That's what I thought.

530
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,830
Have it on her desk by Monday.

531
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,770
Look at her with her natural kaori.

532
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,340
I have no money.

533
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,560
It's all the filters though.

534
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,140
Okay, I should be taking more photos.

535
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,180
That's the point of the game, right?

536
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,760
Oh, what's this?

537
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:22,800
Wait.

538
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,780
It lit up.

539
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,280
It lit up.

540
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,660
It lit up.

541
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,920
Oh, wait.

542
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,940
It's Koraku again.

543
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,260
Wait, but what else lit up then?

544
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,040
I saw it.

545
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,580
We saw it, right?

546
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,220
Oh.

547
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,440
Oh, it was just reminding me.

548
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,140
It was like, dummy, you already took a picture of this one.

549
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,000
Idiot.

550
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,300
God.

551
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,580
What about this?

552
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,540
What do you think this is called, everybody?

553
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,420
Gamer laptop.

554
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,680
Gamer.

555
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,800
Gamer laptop.

556
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Note-o-pacocon.

557
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,780
Happy streaming on my birthday.

558
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,340
Why is it everybody's birthday today?

559
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,880
This game is a surprisingly good way to learn Kana for beginners.

560
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,940
Oh, nice.

561
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,600
Crazy person, happy birthday.

562
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,220
Happy birthday to you.

563
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,900
Happy birthday to you.

564
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,140
Happy birthday, dear crazy person.

565
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,920
Happy birthday to you.

566
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,420
Happy birthday.

567
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,840
How much you want to bet one of the synonyms or like the related words is Takai?

568
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,020
What a scowl to use.

569
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,840
Let's get it.

570
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,520
To turn on.

571
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,080
Download.

572
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,640
To download.

573
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,720
Gosh, you have to pay.

574
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,320
You have to pay so much more just to get the RGB.

575
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,260
What do you think?

576
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,960
Oh, my favorite show.

577
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,600
Ah, no.

578
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,160
I missed it.

579
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,860
I missed it.

580
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,440
I missed it.

581
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,380
Oh, my gosh.

582
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,580
She's so loud.

583
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,140
To watch.

584
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,240
To turn on.

585
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,180
To turn off.

586
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,540
Is that mine?

587
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,000
Why is there just a phone in this box?

588
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,940
It's not my birthday.

589
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,700
It's not your birthday as well?

590
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,620
Well, here's some money for non-birthday-haver Minty Ghost.

591
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,980
This is a cute game.

592
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,780
Thank you for the non-birthday money.

593
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:36,700
What about the phone?

594
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,160
Sumaho.

595
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,400
Sumaho!

596
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,400
Kakeru.

597
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,340
Juuden suru.

598
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,700
That's an important one, isn't it?

599
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,280
Denwa bango.

600
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,920
Very good.

601
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,560
Sumaho.

602
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,280
Sumaho.

603
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,800
What you call me?

604
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,260
Yeah, I called you...

605
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,240
Oh, make 10 photo flashcards.

606
00:30:59,480 --> 00:30:59,880
Nice.

607
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,120
Oh!

608
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,580
Oh.

609
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,800
Wait, how do I... Oh, kyu.

610
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,080
Oh, this one's mysterious.

611
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,240
Okay, hold on.

612
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,760
Reizouko.

613
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,000
Reizouko!

614
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:24,500
I always... Not always, but sometimes I confuse this word, Reizouko, with the word for candle.

615
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:25,880
Hahaha.

616
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,820
Hahaha.

617
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,340
Hahaha.

618
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,220
Sometimes I'll instead say candle, which is... I can't remember right now.

619
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,080
Yes, Rousoku.

620
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,900
Yes, sometimes I confuse the Reizouko.

621
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,980
But I always think of the Re part because it's like the cold, you know?

622
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,740
Rousoku.

623
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,680
Why candle?

624
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,780
It's a bit similar.

625
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,160
Oh.

626
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,820
It's similar to be.

627
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,220
Oh!

628
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,900
Wow, this is a nice camera.

629
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,180
Denshirenji.

630
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,920
I'm gonna turn down the ladies' voice.

631
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,460
It's so loud.

632
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,100
Denshirenji.

633
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,580
Denshirenji.

634
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,780
I'm...

635
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,320
Oh...

636
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,100
Oh, maybe the voice lines.

637
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,340
That's what we're...

638
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,120
There we go.

639
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,620
Apply.

640
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,700
Danshirenji hype.

641
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,520
What's this thing?

642
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,480
Okay, you put it in the game.

643
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,540
It's important enough.

644
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,760
What is it?

645
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,720
Is it a storage cabinet?

646
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,620
What's in here?

647
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,140
A power box?

648
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,020
I have no idea.

649
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,680
It's important enough to be in the game.

650
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,760
Just a box.

651
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,880
What about this thing?

652
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,360
Oh my gosh, cute!

653
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,180
It even has the kanji for learning.

654
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,220
Manhole.

655
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,160
Manhole.

656
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,680
What are the...

657
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,400
Oh, metal.

658
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,440
Metal.

659
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,560
Do you guys know that bird that they'll be like, Hey, what's this made of?

660
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,740
And he goes, metal.

661
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,140
Or, rock.

662
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,520
Or he goes, shrek.

663
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,920
Because of that bird, I can't not say it as...

664
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,480
Metal.

665
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,380
Apollo!

666
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,600
Yes, yes, yes.

667
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,680
Ana.

668
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,840
Marui.

669
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,460
Round.

670
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,600
Ana.

671
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,160
Hole.

672
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,780
Is that a...

673
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,620
Do it.

674
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,060
Do it.

675
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,620
Oh, they're so respectful actually.

676
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,240
Sorry.

677
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,100
Is this...

678
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,340
Um...

679
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,020
Baby days?

680
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,080
Could I please know what that is?

681
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,940
Baby days?

682
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,680
Do you want to get isekai'd?

683
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,200
Maybe.

684
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,840
Atelier...

685
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:22,980
Elise.

686
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,500
Okonomiyaki.

687
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:28,780
Nice.

688
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,540
Oh, I keep forgetting that we've got this one.

689
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,480
But I kind of want to keep the baby days.

690
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,500
Let's keep the baby days.

691
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,760
Oh my gosh, you could really take a picture of so many things in this game.

692
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,400
Sankaku code!

693
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,440
It's a triangle code!

694
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:54,980
Sankaku code!

695
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,000
No way!

696
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,480
The Sankaku code!

697
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,380
Watching your stream at work makes my days so much better.

698
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,840
So have the tip some dude just gave you.

699
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,080
No!

700
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,420
Keep your own tip.

701
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,280
You deserve that.

702
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,400
Tongatta.

703
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,700
Pointy.

704
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,700
Koji.

705
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,700
Construction.

706
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,180
Oku.

707
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,080
To place.

708
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,180
Oh!

709
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,000
Neko Cafe!

710
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,080
Neko Cafe!

711
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,660
Neko Cafe!

712
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:33,270
Skateboard.

713
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:34,510
Skateboard!

714
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,990
Gosh, we're so good at Japanese now.

715
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,550
Skateboard.

716
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,230
Sugoi!

717
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:40,630
Abunai!

718
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,750
Noru.

719
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,350
Whoa!

720
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,110
Skateboard sugoi!

721
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,710
Skateboard abunai!

722
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,210
Skateboard noru.

723
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,930
Who's littering here, huh?

724
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,330
Oh my gosh, it's making a little smiley face though.

725
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,350
Kouhi!

726
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,370
Kouhi!

727
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,330
Kouhi nomu.

728
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,910
Kouhi atsui.

729
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,390
Kouhi okiru.

730
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,290
Wake up, coffee.

731
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,170
You're good at Japanese, aren't you?

732
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,710
Arigato gozaimasu.

733
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,290
Arigato gozaimasu.

734
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,130
Kouhi atsui!

735
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,590
But, if you drink it, you're just like, ah!

736
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,910
Atatakai kouhi.

737
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,690
Oh, atatakai.

738
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,010
Or if it's too hot, ah!

739
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,110
Itta!

740
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,120
Oh, I thought that was a ghost for a second.

741
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,060
Where am I going?

742
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,640
I'm, I'm, I'm rising up!

743
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,700
I'm breaking, I'm gonna break the map.

744
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,520
Oh, oh.

745
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,800
I wish I could go inside stores.

746
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,620
Let's see what else we got.

747
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,520
We got a, um, grocery store here.

748
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,540
Oh, sorry, mini-bini.

749
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,700
Let's see what else we got.

750
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:01,760
Oh!

751
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,220
Sakura.

752
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,200
The sakura.

753
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,400
Sakura.

754
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,840
Under this beautiful night.

755
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,980
First mintsupa ever.

756
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,300
Cause I just got a fat work check.

757
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,880
Ironically, we both learned a bit of Japanese at the same time.

758
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,860
I just took a year-long class and I just finished.

759
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,520
Passed after struggling, but we got a W.

760
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,640
Let's go, nutu!

761
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,320
Thank you!

762
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Thank you so much.

00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,420

764
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,020
Let's go!

765
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,540
Saku.

766
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,660
What's that one song?

767
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,520
Hana wa hana wa hana wa saku.

768
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,120
Kirei.

769
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,060
Not the tsuki.

770
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,660
Not the tsuki is kirei.

771
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,760
But the hana.

772
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,600
And hanami!

773
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,140
I wanted to do hanami this year.

774
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,880
The sakura bloomed right as I was leaving.

775
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,940
So I didn't get to really do hanami or anything.

776
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,500
Oh my gosh.

777
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,460

778
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,920
Oh no.

779
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,540
This is a ti- This is a si- A ti- A ti- It's not a titty.

00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,140
It's a city.

781
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,960
I was gonna say it's a town.

782
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,160
But I also said it was a city.

783
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,660
So I then said it was a titty.

784
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Fuji akishi.

785
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,560

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,220
I didn't see anything!

790
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,520
I said it.

791
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,640
Oh, what's your name?

792
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,640

She's like, I'm gonna cry.

00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,540
I'm gonna punch that guy in the face.

800

Heavy, heavy.

888
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:12,590
I think this would be good also for like Japanese learners wanting to know English, you know?

889
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,330
Because it's just like, how do I say this in English?

Oh, wait.

893
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,650
But they don't say the English pronunciation, so maybe it's kind of hard.

894
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,650
But you could be like, akarui means bright.

895
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,670
Or tsukeru means turn on.

896
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,090
Or kesu means turn off.

897
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:32,870
You know?

00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,970
Labor day was nine months ago.

899
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,110

00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,330
Yeah, exactly.

901
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,890

Wait.

953
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,980
Were you here before?

954
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,810
Why are you giving me that look for?

955
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,850
I like that one too.

956
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:44,650
Okay.

957
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:45,950
I was going to read this.

958
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,590
Fujiyaki.

959
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:48,350
Fujiyaki.

960
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:48,890
Fujiyaki.

961
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:50,310
Fujiyaki.

962
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:50,930
Fujiyaki.

963
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:51,470
Fujiyaki.

964
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:51,730
Fujiyaki.

965
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:51,750
Fujiyaki.

966
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,830
Fujiyaki.

967
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,790
Thanks for the cat, Fake-me.

968
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:54,590
Oh wait.

969
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,250
If we do this, is it like a tree?

970
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:59,070
Oh, yeah.

971
00:44:59,550 --> 00:44:59,950
It's a tree.

972
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,450
Oh, this one's also Sakura.

973
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,210
Can you see me?

974
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,730
Or am I a ghost?

975
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,150
For real?

976
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,470
Am I a ghost for real?

977
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,840
I'm a ghost.

978
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,020
Or a vampire, yeah.

979
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,360
If it weren't raining, this would be pretty aesthetic, wouldn't it?

980
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,300
見る 悪 自分

981
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:42,130

985
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,550
Can we get there?

986
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:00,070
No!

987
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:03,970
The game hates us.

988
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,610
Oh, I guess... Okay, run is a toggle.

989
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,870
I've been like trying to...

990
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,770
Oh, we got the Ginko ATM.

991
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,850
Wow, Fujisan looks so beautiful.

992
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,570
What about this?

993
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,550
Is this like a castle?

994
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:23,330
Oh, yeah.

995
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,870
城 城 Nice.

996
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,430

Make 25 photo flashcards.

1002
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,630
Let's take a picture of our casa.

1003
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,570

I don't know how many times I've forgotten.

1009
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,810
My umbrella in Japan.

1010
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,490
三笠 It's...

1011
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:13,990

00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:19,930
Look at it, a little smiley.

1019
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:34,670
No, it's not.

1020
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,250

Wait, are those the train stations that they say in Metal Gear?

1033
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,620
You should not just have this out.

1034
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,360
That's...

1035
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,100
Oh my god.

1036
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,120

I can't read kanji.

1059
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,480
Look at this cow.

1060
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,320
Why can't I read you?

1061
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,160
Oh my god.

I know why.

1063
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,060
I know it's the parts of the cow.

1064
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,880
But like...

1065
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,340
Tomato.

1066
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:19,860

They are round.

1077
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,450
Round little eggies.

1078
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,630
320 yen for 15?

1079
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:49,740
One star!

1080
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:50,580
You're so expensive!

1081
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:51,680
Every time...

1082
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,100
In the past.

1083
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,620
So expensive.

1084
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,200
Okay!

1085
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,140

What is a Genki-cha?

1088
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,620
You could have a super sport!

1089
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,980
So you can drink?

1090
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,580
You can drink?

1091
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,480
No no.

1092
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,960
I have the lemon mizu, probably.

1093
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,600
Give me some mizu!

1094
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,340

1100
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,280
Pour where?

1101
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,260
Inside my mouth.

1102
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,400
Oh, spaghetti!

1103
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,160

Chigau!

1109
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,040
Do they have any nikku?

1110
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,700
One of the few kanji I actually know.

1111
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:03,800
Nikku!

1112
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,720
Let's see.

1113
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,660
Oh wait, I wonder what it will say.

1114
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,560
Nikku.

1115
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,220

Umai nikku!

1122
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:33,840
Tomare!

1123
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,820
I guess we can't take a picture of that.

1124
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,560
Oh, it does say, I was gonna say, or we can't read it either, but it does say tomare.

1125
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:44,780
Kowa.

1126
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,080

1127
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,480
Oh, let's make an offering.

1128
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,180
And take a picture.

1129
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,060
Jinja.

1130
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,260
Jinja!

1131
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,000

1138
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,440
Yeah!

1139
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,000
Prophet daichi!

1140
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,120
Akarui.

1141
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,320
Takai.

1142
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:23,740
Dekishiteki.

1143
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:32,660
Yeah, I guess it's like very, you know, very Japanese, so I guess you would say historical, right?

1144
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,300
Why is it always raining?

1145
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,800
Oh my god.

1146
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,380
Tori.

1147
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,320
Tori!

1148
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,480
Tori.

1149
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,860
Dentouteki.

1150
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,840
Yeah, but maybe dentouteki would be like more better to say than historical.

1151
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,240
Right?

1152
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,420
Kourai.

1153
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,800
Kuguru.

1154
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,580
Onion pan.

1155
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:14,870
Konkari to karamel iro ni yakiageta.

1156
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:20,750
Onion bread baked to a golden caramel color.

1157
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,920
Onion pan.

1158
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,880
Onion pan.

1159
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,000
Toten no pan wa subete kokuu.

1160
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,480
Oh, no.

1161
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,400
Kokusan komugi.

1162
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:46,980
Oh, komugi!

1163
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,000
I know that one.

1164
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,180
Hyaku pasento shiyoushite imasu.

1165
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,780
All of our bread is made from 100% domestic wheat.

1166
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:55,920
Komugi.

1167
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,120
Irastoya.

1168
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,380
I think this whole game is Irastoya, to be honest.

1169
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,360
Look at her.

1170
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,100
Mainichi oishii.

1171
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,980
Let's take a picture of her.

1172
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:11,820
Tanya.

1173
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:12,480
Tanya!

1174
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,240
Shumonsuru.

1175
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,060
Herabu.

1176
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,720
Yaku.

1177
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,440
Look at all this.

1178
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,460
Anpan is my favorite.

1179
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,480
I love, love, love anpan.

1180
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,240
Which is the red bean...

1181
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,500
Red bean...

1182
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:28,800
Pan.

1183
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,060
Red bean bread.

1184
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,880
I learned a lot.

1185
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,840
What's your favorite though?

1186
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:46,980
Tax included?

1187
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,780
Actually, a lot of places in Japan do tax included.

1188
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,240
I feel like most places do.

1189
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,200
Or at least they'll show the price and then they'll show the price with tax included.

1190
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,680
So you can at least...

1191
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,600
You don't have to do the math on your calculator.

1192
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,920
You can at least just have the tax and...

1193
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,060
It's so awesome.

1194
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,080
Zeikomi.

1195
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,260
So great.

1196
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,400
It's so much easier.

1197
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,720
Also, it's so inexpensive.

1198
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,420
Shokopan.

1199
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,660
Fluffy milk bread.

1200
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,140
Yummy.

1201
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,660
Three cheese.

1202
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,320
Sanchi cheese pan.

1203
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,060
French bread.

1204
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,260
French bread.

1205
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,800
French bread.

1206
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,740
French bread.

1207
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,040
French bread.

1208
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,200
Melon bread.

1209
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,340
Melon bread.

1210
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,740
Melon bread.

1211
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,280
Melon bread.

1212
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:42,360
Melon bread.

1213
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:42,640
Melon bread.

1214
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:43,840
Chococorone.

1215
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,420
Yummy.

1216
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,220
Pita bread.

1217
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,540
Oh, it's like a pita bread.

1218
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,240
Delicious pita bread is from the...

1219
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,160
I can't read.

1220
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,660
Just watch...

1221
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,220
I'm being loved.

1222
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,880
Oh, pita bread.

1223
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,240
Why would the bread store be selling pita bread, guys?

1224
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,020
Why would the bread store...

1225
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,000
That's kinda messed up.

1226
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,660
I like pita bread though.

1227
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,140
Tofu.

1228
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:33,560
Tough times.

1229
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,500
Tough times, nevertheless.

1230
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,240
Peter, the horse is here.

1231
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,000
Delicious pita bread is love through the ages.

1232
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,420
Why would they write that though?

1233
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,520
What?

1234
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,400
Children eat for free?

1235
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,660
Oh my god.

1236
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:09,780
But all... wait, you need to have a... I mean, I'm a child at heart, so like...

1237
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,000
Mama Maria.

1238
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,320
Everybody go to Mama Maria, apparently.

1239
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,920
Oko-sama lunch.

1240
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,640
Yes, Oko-sama lunch.

1241
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,460
But sometimes they have Otona no Oko-sama lunch.

1242
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,420
Where if you want... so it's like the child's... the children's menu, right?

1243
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,080
But sometimes they have a children's menu.

1244
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,880
So that if you're just like...

1245
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,160
I...

1246
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,100
Gomi.

1247
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,500
I took a picture of you!

1248
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,660
So that if you want the stuff on the children's menu, you can have it.

1249
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,700
This is the most annoying thing.

1250
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,140
Separate?

1251
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:02,320
Ok.

1252
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,320
Oh my gosh, one of the most annoying things to like throw away in Japan...

1253
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,280
Was my...

1254
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:10,680
Makeup.

1255
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,860
Because, ok...

1256
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,660
Imagine you get a...

1257
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,700
Oh my god!

1258
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,440
Eating Mike Tyson's ass!

1259
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,640
Thanks for the five, captain!

1260
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,040
Thank you so much!

1261
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,420
Thank you, thank you.

1262
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:28,420
Imagine you get a waterproof like...

1263
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,660
You know, something.

1264
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,860
Like a waterproof concealer, right?

1265
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,100
And then...

1266
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,420
In Japan, you have to like rinse out all your stuff.

1267
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,220
And like...

1268
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,960
It was so annoying because it's waterproof!

1269
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,020
So I'm like...

1270
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,980
Trying to get the water inside the little tube.

1271
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,940
And then trying to get it to come out.

1272
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,860
And it was just so...

1273
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,340
It was so...

1274
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:53,620
Annoying.

1275
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,660
It was so awful.

1276
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,600
Oh my gosh, our picture together.

1277
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:00,600
Well, not together.

1278
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,260
Hoki.

1279
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,020
Hoki.

1280
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,160
Soji suru.

1281
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:08,960
Haku.

1282
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,400
Nagai.

1283
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,500
Oh, look at this!

1284
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,020
What is this?

1285
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:18,660
Fun!

1286
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:19,640
Gumi!

1287
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,640
Okashi.

1288
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,540
Okashi.

1289
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:25,940
Amai.

1290
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:26,860
Oishi.

1291
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,220
Wakeru.

1292
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,420
No, I'm not dividing anything.

1293
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,280
I'm not dividing...

1294
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,860
I'm eating this whole bag myself.

1295
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,780
Oh, good morning.

1296
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,680
Good morning, world!

1297
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,660
Oh, we're back here!

1298
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,500
Wait, what's this?

1299
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,520
Egao Dori?

1300
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,140
What's on the Egao street over here?

1301
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,080
Hold on.

1302
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,740
We're going down there.

1303
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,040
We're gonna go see.

1304
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,560
Oh, wait.

1305
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,340
We can get Reiko-chan!

1306
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:05,880
Reiko-chan!

1307
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:10,720
Reiko-chan!

1308
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:10,880
Figures!

1309
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,620
Figures!

1310
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:13,780
Figures!

1311
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:14,560
Atsumeru.

1312
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:15,960
Otaku!!

1313
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:17,700
Otaku!

1314
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,040
Shumi.

1315
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,120
Watashi no shumi wa...

1316
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,080
Idol...

1317
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,300
Wait, what is this thing?

1318
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,900
What is this thing?

1319
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:37,420
Nuigurumi.

1320
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,440
Well, yeah, but what kind of nuigurumi?

1321
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,780
Fuwa fuwa.

1322
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,400
Takishimeru.

1323
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:44,620
Ageru.

1324
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:44,900
Come here.

1325
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:46,660
I'm gonna give you something.

1326
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,280
What is that?

1327
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,940
It's a whale?

1328
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:50,980
Perhaps?

1329
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,160
Look at her.

1330
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,320
My wife.

1331
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,300
What if I took a picture of something and it said wife?

1332
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:08,820
My wife.

1333
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,680
It's a business hour.

1334
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,820
That's also probably important kanji to know.

1335
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,290
Thank you for the 10 gift.

1336
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,010
Thank you.

1337
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:30,710
Thank you.

1338
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,610
This isn't just in my head.

1339
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,270
This isn't just... This is real.

1340
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,250
This is not just my chunibyo delusions.

1341
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,550
This is real.

1342
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,580
I like this.

1343
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,620
I like this.

1344
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,280
Cute!

1345
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,140

1347
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,220
She must be so popular.

01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,120
Popular idol.

1349
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,320
She must be so popular.

01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:22,320
Popular idol.

1351
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,800
I love that there's a clip art for chunigirl.

1352
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,500
Irastoya is amazing.

1353
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,020
They have so many awesome...

1354
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:44,150
Promenition of love.

1355
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,290
They have so many different illustrations.

1356
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:49,770
You would be surprised.

Taisen kakudo.

1361
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,100
You got the...

1362
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:00,100
You got the...

1363
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:00,100
You got the...

1364
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,500
You got the fighting game floor.

1365
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,800
You got the ongaku game floor.

1366
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,360
Oto- I mean, sorry.

1367
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,440
Oto-ge.

1368
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:07,940

1369
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:09,760

1374
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,420
What's down this way?

1375
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:22,990
Look how cute.

1376
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:27,790
Did someone just leave their purse and their food?

1377
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,250
I'll take that.

1378
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:33,830
Tame-mono.

1379
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:34,710

1384
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:43,590
What's this one?

1385
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,630
Look at how fancy you can make these.

1386
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:48,030
Look.

1387
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:48,990
Look at this.

1388
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,170
Look at the bouquet and everything.

Welcome to membership.

1392
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,630
Thank you!

1393
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:58,550
Can we go?

1394
01:04:58,690 --> 01:04:59,030
Can we?

1395
01:04:59,110 --> 01:04:59,510
Banana!

1396
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,100
Orubako!

1397
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,840
Yes, danboru.

1398
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,040
I know that because of...

1399
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,540
Because of...

1400
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,780
The girl with the... Yotsuba!

1401
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,620
Just a box.

1402
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,100

1403
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,220

1406
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:38,630
Just a box.

1407
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,330
Just a box.

1408
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:45,750
Can I go upstairs?

1409
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:50,270
No!

1410
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:52,070
Why would you deny me?

1411
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,130
What's the point?

1412
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:55,830
Oh.

1413
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:57,710
Egaodori.

1414
01:05:58,050 --> 01:05:59,070

1415
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:00,690
Man.

1416
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:03,910
I was so excited.

1417
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:07,310
Take a picture of the door to darkness?

1418
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:08,610
No?

1419
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:09,310
Okay.

1420
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:12,030
Wow.

1421
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,830
I guess it's a pretty small map, isn't it?

1422
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,370
Otakuma.

1423
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:25,850
Get it?

1424
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:27,890
Because it's otaku and kuma.

1425
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:28,910
Kuma is bear.

1426
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,150
And then otaku.

1427
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,130
Otaku.

1428
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:31,750
Kuma.

1429
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,830
Did someone mention the door to darkness?

1430
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:38,410
That's the bear.

1431
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:42,210
Hey, a maid cafe?

1432
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,790
Yes!

1433
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,610
It's based off of Maid Dreamin'.

1434
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,970
Actually, the sign is pretty close.

1435
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:49,610
And the logo.

1436
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:52,270
Maid Dreamin'.

1437
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,490
Maid Melody.

1438
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:54,750
Let's play in the land of dreams.

1439
01:06:59,290 --> 01:06:59,970
Oh.

1440
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:03,570
Demon King's life.

1441
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,850
Demon King's life.

1442
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,850
Access denied, though.

1443
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:10,330
They banned me.

1444
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:12,130
I've been banned from the maid cafe.

1445
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:14,690
I've been banned.

1446
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,000
Wait.

1447
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,440
Guitar girls?

1448
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,040
Nijukan Hatsu.

1449
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:28,860
Oh, wait.

1450
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,480
Nijukan Hatsubaichu.

1451
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:32,880
Hatsubaichu.

1452
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:35,500
It's another one you hear all the time.

1453
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,900
On sale now!

1454
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,780
Have you guys ever heard of guitar girls?

1455
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,980
It's probably like...

1456
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,000
Lifetime ban!

1457
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,520
No.

1458
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,000
No.

1459
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,200
They wouldn't ever.

1460
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:53,320
I mean, they kicked me out by my butt and said, If we ever see you again here, we're calling the cops!

1461
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,580
But I don't think they mean that for a lifetime.

1462
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,840
I don't think they mean that for that long.

1463
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:01,660
Probably until like next week, you know?

1464
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,720
They kicked me to the curb right on my poor, poor bottom.

1465
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:10,820
And they said, You better not step another foot inside this establishment, or we're calling the cops!

1466
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,180
But I don't think they meant that for life.

1467
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,560
If they meant it for life, they should have said, In our whole life!

1468
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:22,400
But also, I'm dead.

1469
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,480
So...

1470
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,860
That's kind of discriminatory to me.

1471
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,180
I don't...

1472
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,440
My afterlife never ends.

1473
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:31,540
They're just being tsune?

1474
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,820
Yeah, I hope so.

1475
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,320
Fusen!

1476
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:36,780
Fukuramashu.

1477
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:39,300
Waru.

1478
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,620
Pan!

1479
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:42,920
Pan!

1480
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:43,540
Pan!

1481
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:44,580
Pan!

1482
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:44,880
Oh no!

1483
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,100
Oh no!

1484
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,440
Why is it making this face?

1485
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,380
Oh no!

1486
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:49,720
Pan!

1487
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,360
Pan!

1488
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:50,940
Pan!

1489
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:51,500
Pan!

1490
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:52,960
Eien da!

1491
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,660
No, no, no, no.

1492
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,340
No, no, no.

1493
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,340
Wait, can we go down here?

1494
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,440
Fujiaki Dendetsu.

1495
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,900
Fujiaki Electric Railway.

1496
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,240
Sakurai.

1497
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:11,660
Sakurai Station.

1498
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,700
Sakurai Station.

1499
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,120
Oh my gosh, I wanna go see Shizen ni Modoru.

1500
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,200
Is he gonna...

1501
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:18,820
Wait a second.

1502
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,800
Why is the chef...

1503
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,740
Why is the chef around all these edible animals?

1504
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,140
Also, what a movie to release.

1505
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,240
Okay, is this a romance?

1506
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,140
It's being released on Valentine's Day.

1507
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:32,580
Wait.

1508
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,000
Wait.

1509
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:45,070
What is he intending to do with them?

1510
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:49,210
Return to nature?

1511
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:50,890
Like, return them to nature?

1512
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:52,730
Or...

1513
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:53,970
Whoa!

1514
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:57,690
Can I get...

1515
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:57,810
Oh.

1516
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:00,550
Looks like that plane had some panties on.

1517
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:03,450
Wait.

1518
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:04,830
Where did it go?

1519
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:07,310
Huh?

1520
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,210
Ghost plane?

1521
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,990
Where did it go?

1522
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:14,170
There's another cat.

1523
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,080
Cat.

1524
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:21,460
Cat.

1525
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,540
This is such a beautiful scenery.

1526
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,700
Oh wow, I actually got something.

1527
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:44,540
Leight.

1528
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,120
Light.

1529
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:46,820
High.

1530
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:47,920
Legible.

1531
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:56,020
Okay, I want a picture of him with the leaf falling in the background.

1532
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,580
Really artsy, you know?

1533
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,200
How was Paz today?

1534
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,520
Oh my god.

1535
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,940
She is such a troublemaker.

1536
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,700
She is such a little troublemaker.

1537
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,740
She is so...

1538
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,480
Wait, no.

1539
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,660
I wanted it behind it.

1540
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:16,020
Hold on.

1541
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,020
Let's try another one.

1542
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:17,360
Oh!

1543
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:18,420
No!

1544
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:19,560
I was too late.

1545
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,840
She... Okay, so I have from my time in Japan when I went to high school.

1546
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:32,680
I have a thousand paper cranes that my classmates created for me.

1547
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,520
And I've kept it all this time.

1548
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:40,120
And guess what has holes in it now because she can't stop biting it.

1549
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:42,460
She's like...

1550
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,780
All the time.

1551
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,820
And then there's also a box that I have.

1552
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,300
Filled with letters that were sent to me.

1553
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,340
And she keeps trying to knock it over.

1554
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,560
There's too many letters that I don't know what to do with them yet.

1555
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,980
I might have to get like a really really really big scrapbook or something.

1556
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:00,880
But I don't know what to do with it yet.

1557
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,700
And she keeps trying to knock over the box.

1558
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,320
She is such a menace.

1559
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,360
And so she'll go from the box to the cranes.

1560
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,520
Back to the box to the cranes.

1561
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:14,860
And then she'll try and chew on every cord that I have.

1562
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,660
Which, you know, by my computer.

1563
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:17,680
I have quite a few.

1564
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,160
So she's just such a troublemaker.

1565
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,100
She's such a...

1566
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:29,200
Why did your classmates make a thousand cranes for you?

1567
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:30,480
Oh, because I was leaving.

1568
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,260
I was going home and so they were like...

1569
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,880
Minto-chan, we had so much fun with you here.

1570
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,860
We'll miss you so much.

1571
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,360
Yeah, I was leaving.

1572
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,220
So sad.

1573
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:52,420
Not because you died.

1574
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,140
Why would they make that for me?

1575
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:54,700
Because I died.

1576
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,800
Where are the leaves?

1577
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,360
It looks like it's on his head!

1578
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,300
Old.

1579
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,560
History.

1580
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,000
History.

1581
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:10,380
History.

1582
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:11,540
History.

1583
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,200
When you...

1584
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,040
Basically the thousand cranes is like you make a wish.

1585
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:21,380
So...

1586
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,100
Murphy, thanks.

1587
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:23,900
Crazy.

1588
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,420
It's like people like you or something.

1589
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:26,720
That'd be...

1590
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:27,440
Why?

1591
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:28,640
Huh?

1592
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:29,680
No.

1593
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,240
Why?

1594
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,360
What is the top one so we can tell Matara?

1595
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:38,340
Furui.

1596
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,560
Furui.

1597
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,020
I think...

1598
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:43,680
I feel like...

1599
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,840
Rekishiteki would be like a sick insult.

1600
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:46,740
You know?

1601
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,880
Instead of like...

1602
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,900
Instead of calling someone just old, you call them historical.

1603
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,380
You're just like...

1604
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:55,100
Damn, girl.

1605
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:55,740
You're not just old.

1606
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,340
Like, you are historical.

1607
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,260
Like...

1608
01:13:58,260 --> 01:13:59,180
Whoa.

1609
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:00,680
Rekishiteki.

1610
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,860
It's like ancient.

1611
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:05,840
But like...

1612
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,480
It's like a sophisticated insult.

1613
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,740
Knowing her though, she'd take it as a compliment.

1614
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,240
Can I take a picture of the rock?

1615
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:18,760
Iwa?

1616
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:19,220
Iwa!

1617
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:21,880
Wait, what's the difference between rock and rock?

1618
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:22,820
What's the difference between Iwa and ishi?

1619
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,220
Are ishi smaller?

1620
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,220
Ooki.

1621
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:27,240
Omori.

1622
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:28,260
Katai.

1623
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,260
What about this?

1624
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:35,580
Shokubutsu.

1625
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:36,620
Shokubutsu.

1626
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,080
Ueru.

1627
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,540
Shizen.

1628
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:43,600
Ha.

1629
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,260
Oh!

1630
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,120
This is Akihabara.

1631
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:48,940
Ha.

1632
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:49,780
Ha.

1633
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:50,780
Ha.

1634
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,040
Ha.

1635
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:51,140
Ha.

1636
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:51,260
Ha.

1637
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:51,420
Ha.

1638
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:51,740
Ha.

1639
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,740
Wait.

1640
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:53,620
Wait, wait, wait.

1641
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,040
I gotta tell it a joke.

1642
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:57,140
I gotta say a joke.

1643
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:58,860
Your mom.

1644
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,120
Ha.

1645
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:00,460
Ha.

1646
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:00,820
Ha.

1647
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,180
Ha.

1648
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:02,400
Ha.

1649
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:03,680
Ha.

1650
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:04,500
Ha.

1651
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:04,780
Ha.

1652
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:04,920
Ha.

1653
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:21,900
It's here.

1654
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:24,560
I should be able to take a picture of everything.

1655
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:30,300
Oh, the cat!

1656
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:32,760
No, this is a different cat.

1657
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:35,940
Litter!

1658
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:36,460
Litter!

1659
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:36,820
Litter!

1660
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,820
Oh, just nomimono.

1661
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,540
Why don't you call it Mizu?

1662
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,200
You're right, your mom is haha.

1663
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:48,840
See?

1664
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,860
It's a pretty sophisticated joke, is it not?

1665
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:57,560
It's a pretty sophisticated joke, is it not?

1666
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,700
Oh, hats, coats, accessories.

1667
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:05,460
I love this.

1668
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,820
Everything is a borrowed word except Boshi.

1669
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:10,060
Which...

1670
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,020
Is that...

1671
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:19,560
Is that a Chinese-taken word, I wonder?

1672
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,420
If anybody knows.

1673
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:28,800
But it's so funny, everything else is a borrowed word.

1674
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,480
Boshi the Rock.

1675
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:35,850
Wait, why can't I read it?

1676
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,650
No, why can't I read it?

1677
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:40,190
I can't read!

1678
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:41,810
Double row!

1679
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:42,610
Double!

1680
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:44,570
Single!

1681
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,910
No, no, no.

1682
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:46,910
No, no, no.

1683
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:48,310
No, no.

1684
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:53,490
I can't read it.

1685
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:54,410
toisletto peipa.

1686
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:55,230
Toilet paper!

1687
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:58,010
They're a taco!

1688
01:16:58,190 --> 01:16:59,490
Thank you for the purl opera choppy you!

1689
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:01,650
Thank you so much.

1690
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:02,150
Thank you.

1691
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:04,070
Arigato.

1692
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:13,990
So one thing I had to learn.

1693
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,810
Or rather, you learn kind of quickly.

1694
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:19,030
Is...

1695
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:21,190
Is when you say...

1696
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:28,250
So you'd say like, you know, when you're at a restaurant, you get something on your mouth or whatever, you use a napkin.

1697
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:31,970
But in Japanese, napkin has a totally different meaning.

1698
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:37,210
ナプキン ナプキン Don't go to a restaurant... well, you could.

1699
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:39,890
You could go to a restaurant and ask for a napkin.

1700
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:42,730
But um...

1701
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,350
But uh...

1702
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:49,450
You might um...

1703
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,970
What does it mean though?

1704
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,510
It means...

1705
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:58,990
It means a sanitary pad.

1706
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:01,330
Things that...

1707
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:03,830
You know...

1708
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:06,470
When you're on your period.

1709
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:13,370
So if you go to a restaurant and say, Hey, can I get a pad with my meal?

1710
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:17,130
People might be like...

1711
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:22,430
Uh oh, we have a freaky...

1712
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:23,710
Unless you're at...

1713
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:24,490
Wait...

1714
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:27,570
Did...

1715
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:32,020
Did that...

1716
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,980
Did that podcast episode go up about...

1717
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,440
The jail?

1718
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,540
I think it did though, right?

1719
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,480
Oh wait, no, it wasn't the podcast.

1720
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,540
It was with Giri.

1721
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,040
The collab with Giri.

1722
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,160
The collab with Giri.

1723
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:48,580
Where...

1724
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:51,440
I went to a prison themed restaurant.

1725
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,240
And um...

1726
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,920
And what restaurant would that possibly be normal?

1727
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,460
Exactly what I'm saying!

1728
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,960
There was...

1729
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,420
There was...

1730
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,020
There was a...

1731
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:04,500
A jail themed restaurant.

1732
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,080
And they would serve like um...

1733
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:14,180
They would serve like a strawberry jam type stuff on a sanitary napkin.

1734
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:18,720
It wasn't menstruation themed cafe.

1735
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,240
They just had...

1736
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,080
I think it was just that one thing that was.

1737
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:22,980
Which...

1738
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,600
I would hope there's nothing more.

1739
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,320
It's soft.

1740
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:27,960
It sits.

1741
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:29,360
It's round.

1742
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,310
A clinic.

1743
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,670
But this by itself is a medicine.

1744
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,900
And this...

1745
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,000
The...

1746
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,340
The...

1747
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:46,780
This one.

1748
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:47,240
The...

1749
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,280
The kyouku.

1750
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:49,240
The kyouku part.

1751
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,860
The kyouku part is um...

1752
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:53,500
Kind of means like a...

1753
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,400
Type of...

1754
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,380
How do you say?

1755
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,560
Like a building?

1756
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,500
Not a build...

1757
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,240
Like a...

1758
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,980
How would you say?

1759
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,320
If the okyaku-sama asks for a napkin, the okyaku-sama shall have a napkin.

1760
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,980
That's the Japanese service I expect.

1761
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:10,700
Oh can we go...

1762
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:10,900
No!

1763
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:13,500
No!

1764
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,900
This is an important kanji right here.

1765
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:17,920
This.

1766
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:21,320
This is an important kanji.

1767
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:22,500
Tabet.

1768
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,380
Taberu is to eat, right?

1769
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,200
Tabe.

1770
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,060
Houdai.

1771
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,440
Sometimes you will say nomi in front of this.

1772
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:32,020
Nomi.

1773
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,320
Houdai.

1774
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:33,960
Tabe.

1775
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:35,240
Houdai.

1776
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,180
All you can eat, baby!

1777
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,080
All you can eat.

1778
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,180
3,200 yen.

1779
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,440
Wow, that's not so bad for all you can eat.

1780
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,100
All you can eat, baby.

1781
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:50,540
Yeah, and then nomi houdai.

1782
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:51,500
All you can drink.

1783
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,340
All you can drink.

1784
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,160
All you can drink.

1785
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,720
This is an important Japanese.

1786
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,660
I think it's an important Japanese.

1787
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,140
How much is that in America?

1788
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,500
Nowadays, maybe like 25 dollars.

1789
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,460
Maybe like 25 dollars.

1790
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,580
Oh sushi.

1791
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,320
Hayashi sushi.

1792
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,200
Hayashi sushi-ten.

1793
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,120
Yummi.

1794
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:25,980
More like 20?

1795
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,880
Wait, is it that bad?

1796
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,760
More like 20 bucks a current.

1797
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,140
See, I thought I was being generous with 25.

1798
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:37,400
Oh my gosh.

1799
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,520
Oh, I should order some yen.

1800
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,840
I've been trying to like order yen.

1801
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,660
I typically have been using my card as much as I can while in Japan.

1802
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,760
Stonks.

1803
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:08,780
Stonks.

1804
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,800
Stonks, stonks, stonks.

1805
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,620
Will it go back?

1806
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,600
I don't know.

1807
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:30,200
Have you done Snake Eater?

1808
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,700
I think that would be a good one.

1809
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:41,720
Yen and Cat are around the same, so I guess that's 30 bucks.

1810
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,920
No, I think that's too much.

1811
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:46,940
Okay, hold on.

1812
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:47,880
I'm gonna look it up.

1813
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:48,800
Yen...

1814
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:52,850
Wait, oh!

1815
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,750
Wait, is this from today?

1816
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:57,810
Oh my gosh, I have an AmiAmi payment request.

1817
01:22:58,430 --> 01:22:59,870
Oh, okay, it's not so expensive.

1818
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:03,630
That's for a free rent thing that I got.

1819
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:04,990
Okay, um...

1820
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,630
I just noticed it though.

1821
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:08,670
Oh my gosh, okay.

1822
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:11,130
USD to Yen.

1823
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:14,270
Okay, Yen...

1824
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,050
3,200.

1825
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:18,450
It's 20 dollars!

1826
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:21,470
Oh my gosh, you guys were right.

1827
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:23,450
Pyrobug, thank you for the 10.

1828
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:24,930
Thank you for the 10 memberships.

1829
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:25,390
Thank you!

1830
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,890
Also, Shabu Shabu.

1831
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:32,250
Shabu Shabu.

1832
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:33,470
I want to eat it.

1833
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:34,830
It's delicious.

1834
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,070
I love Shabu Shabu.

1835
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:40,010
Hmm...

1836
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:42,070
Have I gotten a picture of a car yet?

1837
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,470
Car!

1838
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:47,710
Drive!

1839
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:48,990
Fast!

1840
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:50,290
Slow!

1841
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:55,700
Can I go down here?

1842
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:59,920
Oh wait, there's another entrance for Sakurai Station.

1843
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,260
Sakurai Station.

1844
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,220
But what line is it?

1845
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:04,320
Hmm...

1846
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,600
I wonder.

1847
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,960
Shabu Shabu is the best.

1848
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,600
Oh no!

1849
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,740
People are leaving their stuff everywhere!

1850
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:13,860
Bag!

1851
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,560
What is that?

1852
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,560
I don't know why it's in...

1853
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,640
I've always wondered why it's in...

1854
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:20,720
Katakana.

1855
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,260
Is it a borrowed word?

1856
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:25,100
If so, where is it borrowed from?

1857
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:26,760
Ireru!

1858
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:27,660
Dasu!

1859
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:28,960
Hakobu!

1860
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,440
Kaban-chan.

1861
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,260
There is a kanji for it.

1862
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:39,560
Kaban.

1863
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,720
Why in Katakana though?

1864
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:43,800
Kaban.

1865
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,680
Are they leaving their suitcase here?

1866
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,260
Can I take a picture of the graffiti?

1867
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:51,660
Oh my god, I can!

1868
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:52,980
Raccoon City.

1869
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:54,540
Rakugaki.

1870
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:55,540
Rakugaki!

1871
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,920
The first one!

1872
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:03,660
Iho!

1873
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:05,960
Illegal!

1874
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,400
Kaku!

1875
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:08,880
Colorful!

1876
01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:13,670
Oh my god.

1877
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:16,030
Not the...

1878
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:17,090
Illegal!

1879
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:20,310
Oh wait, here!

1880
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:21,150
Shashingo!

1881
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:23,650
Shashingo, you're doing illegal activities.

1882
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:25,190
Oops.

1883
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:27,450
Rakugaki.

1884
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:28,250
Rakugaki.

1885
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:31,910
You're doing illegal activities.

1886
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,060
What have we missed?

1887
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:45,840
I think there was an area to the left down here that we didn't go to.

1888
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,420
And of course, Fuji-san.

1889
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,260

1890
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:55,200

My favorite flowers!

1897
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:08,840
Hana.

1898
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,740
These are ajisai!

1899
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,360
They're my favorite!

1900
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,760
I dreamed of love.

1901
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,540
I love ajisai.

1902
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:19,900

Hydrangea.

1906
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,320
Can I crouch in this game?

1907
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:29,720
Oh nice.

1908
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:37,140
So I can get like a really aesthetic nice photo of the hydrangea.

1909
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,320
Hana.

1910
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,040
Wait, no, no.

1911
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,240
Hana.

1912
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:44,580
There we go.

1913
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,500
That's better.

1914
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:47,220
Hana.

1915
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,600
What are you doing here?

1916
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:53,520
What are you doing here?

1917
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,300
Neko.

1918
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,040
Neko.

1919
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,480
What are you doing there little cat?

1920
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,500
This is how...

1921
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,360
This is how my cat looks at me.

1922
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,480
Toilets.

1923
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,580
Can I not take a picture of the toilets?

1924
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,160
Oh.

1925
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,000
Kinyan!

1926
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:25,800
Smoking is prohibited.

1927
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:27,940
No smoking.

1928
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,080
This says toilets.

1929
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,920
In case you couldn't figure it out.

1930
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:33,540
Wait.

1931
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,260
Why is it like this?

1932
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:36,860
Wait.

1933
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:39,360
What is this?

1934
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:40,180
Oh okay.

1935
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,500
So this is for like the...

1936
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,620
You know, the bigger ones.

1937
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,320
And the ones for like families and stuff.

1938
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:47,560
This is the...

1939
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,520
Ladies room but...

1940
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,960
Why is there also a man sign right there?

1941
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:02,140
Hmm.

1942
01:28:07,180 --> 01:28:08,720
Why do the doors have windows?

1943
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:10,420
I don't think there...

1944
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,740
I think this is only the one that's one person.

1945
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,140
But you can't see inside.

1946
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,740
Because it has the lock thing down here.

1947
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:18,300
That.

1948
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:21,720
And it's occupied.

1949
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:24,900
I gotta pee.

1950
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:27,020

1951
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:28,140

01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,040
Let me in.

1953
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:31,500
Please.

1954
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,640
Oh my god.

1955
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,660
I'm not gonna make it.

1956
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,780
I'm not gonna make it.

1957
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:45,680
There's so many.

1958
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:49,420
There's so many magazines.

1959
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,440
Oh there's our guitar girls.

1960
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,160
What is this one?

1961
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:57,840
Oh!

1962
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:58,000
Oh!

1963
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:01,520
Before you go home...

1964
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,160
Give me a kiss.

1965
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:04,240

1966
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,560

1969
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:19,460
...

1970
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,400
What is it?

1971
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,100
The ways in which you talk to me.

1972
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,340
Satoru.

1973
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,300
Make me wish that I was gone.

1974
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:33,980
Satoru.

1975
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:37,240
Wait, no, I said his name two times in a row.

1976
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:39,520
Wait.

1977
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:46,300

1978
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,660
They're both named Satoru!

1979
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,260
They are?

1980
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,160
Really?

1981
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,240
Oh.

1982
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,420
Can I read the titles?

1983
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,260
Rosebend.

1984
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,680

1985
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:16,600

1986
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:18,500

1993
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:34,200
No.

1994
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,260
This is a fashion magazine.

1995
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,100
I don't care.

1996
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,280

Suma hold it down.

2003
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:57,640
No, don't.

2004
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,280
They keep the steamy stuff inside.

2005
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:02,640
I want...

2006
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,700
I once stayed at a...

2007
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:09,600
At a hotel that was across the street from a...

2008
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:14,100
I guess a publishing company, but they published like a ton of...

2009
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,400
Like...

2010
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:17,020
Um...

2011
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,080
Uh...

2012
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:18,700
The...

2013
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,360
It was like...

2014
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,900
Not Shonen Jump.

2015
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,940
But one of the magazines that has like the steamier...

2016
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,600
The steamier...

2017
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,340
The more...

2018
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,100
The more...

2019
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:31,340
Ooh la la...

2020
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:33,500
Mangas and stuff like that.

2021
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:36,520
And so they just had them out on display...

2022
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,420
I wonder if I have a picture.

2023
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:38,800
Hold on, I'm gonna look.

2024
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:41,820
Because...

2025
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:43,600
I was so like...

2026
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,880
It was so funny to see it every time I would...

2027
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,300
Let's see.

2028
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,100
When did I go?

2029
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:52,080
When did I stay?

2030
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,300
Maybe this trip.

2031
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:01,280
Hmm...

2032
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:02,360
No...

2033
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,000
Wait.

2034
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:06,800
Maybe it was this trip.

2035
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:08,060
No...

2036
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:11,690
I'm looking at my phone right now.

2037
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:12,670
If you couldn't tell.

2038
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:14,790
Does it say Nenmanga?

2039
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:17,630
I guess maybe technically.

2040
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:19,090
But it was like...

2041
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:20,630
So sexy.

2042
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:21,990
It was so sexy.

2043
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:24,030
And like they also...

2044
01:32:24,030 --> 01:32:25,070
Like you know how...

2045
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:25,350
Um...

2046
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:26,470
Like...

2047
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:28,030
They'll have the...

2048
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:30,710
The grab your models on the front and everything.

2049
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:32,870
And I would like go and get food.

2050
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:35,090
And then every time I would pass this...

2051
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:36,250
This...

2052
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:36,830
Like...

2053
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:38,350
Sign of...

2054
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:40,490
Sexy girls.

2055
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:42,370
It was kind of awesome.

2056
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:44,630
Hmm...

2057
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:47,150
Hmm...

2058
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:49,210
No...

2059
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:49,950
Oh wait.

2060
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:51,970
Was it this one?

2061
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:54,310
No...

2062
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:55,710
When did I stay?

2063
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,070
When did I stay there?

2064
01:32:57,390 --> 01:32:59,350
I can't remember at all.

2065
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:01,710
Hmm...

2066
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:05,190
I'm staying at too many hotels all the time.

2067
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:06,050
Hmm...

2068
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:06,230
Hmm...

2069
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:08,250
This is...

2070
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,670
This is...

2071
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:10,410
Is it this one?

2072
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:15,090
Is it this?

2073
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:19,010
No...

2074
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:19,530
Ah!

2075
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:22,470
If I can find it later, I'll show you guys.

2076
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:26,770
It was a really nice hotel though.

2077
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:30,310
It was a very nice hotel and it wasn't very expensive.

2078
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:31,510
Um...

2079
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:32,510
And it was a good location.

2080
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:34,290
So...

2081
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:35,330
Um...

2082
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:38,330
I'd recommend it to you guys if I could remember.

2083
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:43,410
I never gonna remember when I stayed there.

2084
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:44,370
I have no idea.

2085
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:45,790
Hmm...

2086
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,050
My memory is going.

2087
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:51,690
Wait.

2088
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:52,350
Is it this one?

2089
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:53,870
It's gonna bother me now.

2090
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:54,530
I'm so sorry.

2091
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:56,270
I know I'm just like looking for it.

2092
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:58,210
But it's really gonna bother me if I don't...

2093
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,270
If I don't look...

2094
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:00,610
If I don't look at least a little bit.

2095
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:04,920
If I don't...

2096
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:05,280
Wait.

2097
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,420
I'm under camera, right?

2098
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:06,840
Yeah.

2099
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:07,060
Yeah.

2100
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,300
Under camera.

2101
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,960
It was definitely with this camera.

2102
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,440
But it wasn't here.

2103
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,200
Not there.

2104
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:16,560
Not that.

2105
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:22,920
Who knows?

2106
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,400
You can find it, Mint.

2107
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:26,200
I can't.

2108
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:27,020
Oh.

2109
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,820
I can't find it.

2110
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,420
I wanna play Guitar Star.

2111
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:39,400
I feel like this is such a good game actually to...

2112
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,500
Like learn so much.

2113
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:41,900
Yeah.

2114
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:42,340
Yeah.

2115
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,840
We got our menu.

2116
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:48,680
What's your favorite kind of ramen?

2117
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,160
I think for me, my favorite is shoyu ramen.

2118
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,100
Which is...

2119
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,640
Like the soy sauce.

2120
01:34:59,340 --> 01:34:59,840
Tonkatsu.

2121
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:01,300
Tonkatsu.

2122
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:01,680
Wow.

2123
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,940
Lots of people saying tonkatsu.

2124
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:04,460
Really?

2125
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,200
Classic tonkatsu.

2126
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,420
Tonkatsu.

2127
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:08,820
See you.

2128
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:11,980
Tonkatsu.

2129
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:12,160
Wow.

2130
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:12,320
Sorry.

2131
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,820
So many people push tonkatsu.

2132
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:14,920
Wow.

2133
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:18,780
Karaage.

2134
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:20,260
Miso.

2135
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:23,460
You so what?

2136
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,020
You so hum.

2137
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,920
You so what?

2138
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:35,440
I think I've only ever had Mr. Noodle.

2139
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,880
What's a Mr. Noodle?

2140
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:42,060
Boo.

2141
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:42,940
Boo.

2142
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:44,340
You guys love it.

2143
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:44,780
Thank you.

2144
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:44,840
Boo.

2145
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:47,220
You guys are too kind.

2146
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:48,680
You guys are too kind.

2147
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,140
Black garlic tonkatsu.

2148
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:51,400
Okay.

2149
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,520
I like anything with garlic in it too.

2150
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,440
Oh my gosh.

2151
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,760
When they're just like toppings, I'm like, give me that garlic.

2152
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:01,980
Put as much garlic as you want.

2153
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:04,820
Moyashi is what?

2154
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,280
Moyashi is...

2155
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:06,700
Oh.

2156
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,900
Moyashi is the beans.

2157
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,560
Not the beans.

2158
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,840
I keep wanting to say soy sauce.

2159
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:16,060
I mean, I think it's a stream bean, but it's not that.

2160
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:18,200
It's bean sprouts.

2161
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:18,780
Thank you.

2162
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:19,420
Bean sprouts.

2163
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:20,960
I don't like a Moyashi.

2164
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,900
I always get no Moyashi.

2165
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:24,680
I don't like Moyashi.

2166
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:27,840
Don't like it.

2167
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:30,460
Yeah.

2168
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,880
It's not my favorite.

2169
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:37,960
But they add crunch.

2170
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,180
I don't like it though.

2171
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:40,940
I don't like bean sprouts.

2172
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:41,400
Eww.

2173
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:42,160
Yeah.

2174
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:43,780
See?

2175
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,980
Every good person does that.

2176
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:59,540
I also... like Japan loves cabbage.

2177
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:05,540
And I don't mind cooked cabbage, but like, raw cabbage is so...

2178
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:12,560
They'll just have a pile of raw cabbage and I'm like, the taste is so strong, it's so bitter.

2179
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:14,360
I'm not a big fan.

2180
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,320
I'm not a big fan.

2181
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,480
Mmm, cabbage.

2182
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:26,380
I like it though if it's... cooked.

2183
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,560
Cooked cabbage is awesome.

2184
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:33,540
I prefer raw to cooked cabbage?

2185
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:34,020
Why?

2186
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,180
Why?

2187
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,020
Can we read this?

2188
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:39,960
No.

2189
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,380
There it is.

2190
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:46,460
Tonkotsu ramen.

2191
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:49,140
There you guys go.

2192
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,020
Pork broth ramen.

2193
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,490
700 yen for a full stomach.

2194
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:01,310
For 700 yen, you will be full.

2195
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:03,350
Full stomach for 700 yen.

2196
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:09,390
Tonkotsu ramen.

2197
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,370
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

2198
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:14,810
Curry.

2199
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:16,690
Wait, I cannot even...

2200
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:19,010
Who puts white text on top of yellow?

2201
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:20,150
I can't even read it.

2202
01:38:23,590 --> 01:38:25,130
I can't even...

2203
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:27,230
What is a curry retort?

2204
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:28,510
Curry and curry.

2205
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:31,310
If you're a student, you can't read it.

2206
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:34,870
Oh, I can't read it.

2207
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:37,310
Oh my gosh, it's so hard to read.

2208
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:41,090
I can't even read it.

2209
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:43,090
Oh, no pets.

2210
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:45,110
Pet kinshi.

2211
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:50,710
Bojoken douhan ka.

2212
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:54,090
Oh my gosh.

2213
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:57,170
Kinen.

2214
01:38:57,170 --> 01:38:58,010
Kinen.

2215
01:38:59,290 --> 01:39:00,130
Shashinkin.

2216
01:39:00,150 --> 01:39:00,670
Oh, sorry.

2217
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:01,630
Satsuki kinshi.

2218
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:06,210
Helmet chakuyo no de.

2219
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:08,390
I can't read anymore.

2220
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:11,070
Helmet chakuyo de.

2221
01:39:12,370 --> 01:39:13,570
Yuten kiji.

2222
01:39:14,470 --> 01:39:16,610
So you can't wear your helmet inside?

2223
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,510
It's kind of a weird request, right?

2224
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:22,710
Wow.

2225
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:25,790
Chusen de.

2226
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:28,770
Oh, chusen is like an evil word, right?

2227
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:29,410
It's a lottery.

2228
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:31,130
Chusen de.

2229
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:34,450
Hachiman mei sama muryo onigiri.

2230
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:37,810
Do a lot of people still smoke in Japan?

2231
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:39,270
Yeah, they do.

2232
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:40,290
I think so.

2233
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:43,290
They do.

2234
01:39:44,370 --> 01:39:47,210
What's the difference between kinen and kinshi?

2235
01:39:47,670 --> 01:39:49,570
Kinen is specifically for smoking.

2236
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,530
And kinshi is just like...

2237
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:53,470
For... like...

2238
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,990
Not allowing you to do something else.

2239
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:57,430
So it can be like...

2240
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:58,890
Tachiri kinshi.

2241
01:39:58,970 --> 01:39:59,730
Do not enter.

2242
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:03,590
Daily reminder, love you men.

2243
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:05,950
Inyamae, thank you!

2244
01:40:08,110 --> 01:40:09,030
Oh, thank you.

2245
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:09,810
Yeah, no problem.

2246
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:15,190
So for that, petto kinshi is...

2247
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:15,930
No pets.

2248
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:22,550
Tabacco.

2249
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:23,690
Osake.

2250
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:25,770
Oden!

2251
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:28,270
Ginko ATM.

2252
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:30,150
What does this say?

2253
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:32,050
Bōhan kamera.

2254
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:34,150
Sado chu.

2255
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:36,470
CCTV camera.

2256
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:39,130
Bōhan kamera.

2257
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:40,590
Wow.

2258
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:42,950
Wait, can I take a picture of this?

2259
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:45,010
No.

2260
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,470
They don't want me to take a picture of the sign.

2261
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:50,050
What else have I gotten?

2262
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:50,430
Oh!

2263
01:40:54,630 --> 01:40:55,890
Where's the moeru?

2264
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:57,370
Oh, moyaseru.

2265
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:58,270
Moyaseru gomin.

2266
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:00,690
No, I like it when they say moeru.

2267
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:01,730
Because it's kind of like...

2268
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:02,150
Moe.

2269
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:03,810
Sometimes like...

2270
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:05,950
I've seen places...

2271
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:06,730
It's funny.

2272
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:08,870
I think it's specifically like...

2273
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:09,870
I've seen them in Akihabara.

2274
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:12,610
But like they'll kind of make a joke about like...

2275
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:13,990
Moe.

2276
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:15,610
You know, moe being like...

2277
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:16,830
Moe moe kyun.

2278
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:17,730
That kind of moe.

2279
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:19,510
But also moeru means like...

2280
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:20,710
To burn, right?

2281
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:23,970
Moeru gomin is like...

2282
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:24,790
Burnable garbage.

2283
01:41:25,810 --> 01:41:26,450
So...

2284
01:41:27,470 --> 01:41:28,110
Moeru.

2285
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:28,870
Moeru.

2286
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:30,730
Moeru gomin.

2287
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:34,990
What does moeru gomin mean?

2288
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:36,850
I don't know.

2289
01:41:39,570 --> 01:41:40,210
Moeru.

2290
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:41,710
Moeru.

2291
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:42,690
Moeru.

2292
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,710
No moeru.

2293
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:46,690
Oh.

2294
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:47,590
Gomi bako.

2295
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:48,390
Gomi bako.

2296
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:50,570
Kitanaai.

2297
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:51,730
Ippai.

2298
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:54,230
Recycle suru.

2299
01:41:56,430 --> 01:41:59,710
May I put your beans and your cans and your pet bottles?

2300
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:05,800
Oh my gosh, it's your bowl, you guys!

2301
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:08,120
Food bowl.

2302
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,000
Food bowl.

2303
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:11,240
Ippai.

2304
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:12,340
Aku.

2305
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:13,820
Kitanaai.

2306
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:15,560
Okay.

2307
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:15,720
Okay.

2308
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:16,080
Eat up!

2309
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:16,520
Eat up!

2310
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:18,940
Eat up!

2311
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:19,340
Eat up!

2312
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:19,680
Eat up!

2313
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:35,730
There's no food.

2314
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:40,260
Sad.

2315
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:48,800
We'll do it in black and white because it's depressing that there's none.

2316
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:51,900
Kaido no Aki no...

2317
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:58,340
It's like... Okay, so flavor and then remember.

2318
01:42:58,660 --> 01:42:59,660
So it's like...

2319
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,460
So is it saying like, remember the flavor of Hokkaido...

2320
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:04,960
Hokkaido...

2321
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:06,420
Fall?

2322
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,120
I love a kabocha so much.

2323
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:10,300
Oh.

2324
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:11,840
Autumn taste?

2325
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,160
Wait.

2326
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:14,140
Mikaku!

2327
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:17,540
Hokkaido no Aki no Mikaku.

2328
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:19,240
Kabocha croquette.

2329
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:20,280
Inume!

2330
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:20,880
Thank you!

2331
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:23,980
Mikaku!

2332
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:24,900
Mikaku!

2333
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:29,730
Mikaku!

2334
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:30,290
Mikaku!

2335
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:33,590
Bet she would feed us nothing but raw cabbage.

2336
01:43:33,690 --> 01:43:34,010
What?

2337
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:36,390
No, I care about you guys more than that.

2338
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:39,670
Or, if we go someplace...

2339
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:43,470
I would give you my raw cabbage that I don't want to eat.

2340
01:43:46,650 --> 01:43:47,130
Rice!

2341
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:48,230
Welcome to Menboship.

2342
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:48,770
Thank you!

2343
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:53,310
I love a kabocha pumpkin.

2344
01:43:55,050 --> 01:43:56,010
So good.

2345
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:59,210
Kabocha croquette.

2346
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:01,890
I love croquette too.

2347
01:44:03,110 --> 01:44:04,230
Do we go over here?

2348
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:06,570
Udon.

2349
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:10,230
Teuchi udon.

2350
01:44:11,290 --> 01:44:11,810
Shinosuke.

2351
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:13,190
Handmade noodles.

2352
01:44:13,690 --> 01:44:14,210
Shinosuke.

2353
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:19,810
Wow.

2354
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:22,070
Wait, are these like the samples?

2355
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:24,710
Are they gonna say... Oh, they do say tabemono.

2356
01:44:24,910 --> 01:44:26,310
But this isn't tabemono.

2357
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:29,390
So, actually, one thing that's really fun...

2358
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:31,510
I don't know if you... I did it through school.

2359
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:33,010
So I don't know...

2360
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:35,610
I don't know how easy it would be for foreigners to book an appointment.

2361
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:40,230
But you know how, like, in Japanese restaurants, they'll have the sample foods that, like...

2362
01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:41,590
Like, exactly like this.

2363
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:45,150
They sit outside and show you what kind of stuff that they...

2364
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:47,150
The ultra-realistic plastic models.

2365
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,630
Exactly!

2366
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:48,010
Exactly!

2367
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:51,650
I went to... I went to a factory.

2368
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:53,870
I don't know if you call it a factory.

2369
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:55,650
But I went to the place that makes them.

2370
01:44:55,770 --> 01:44:58,630
They actually do have a gift store in the front too.

2371
01:44:58,830 --> 01:45:01,910
That you can... I think anybody can go to...

2372
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:02,930
Open to the public.

2373
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:07,450
And buy some kits that you can make your own.

2374
01:45:08,590 --> 01:45:09,390
But also...

2375
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:14,310
I think it would be really fun if you ever go to Japan and you're wanting something to do that's kind of unique.

2376
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:18,510
They do have, like, workshops where you can create your own.

2377
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:20,330
And then they show you the process.

2378
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:21,670
I think we made, like, tempura.

2379
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:24,250
And then you get to take it home too.

2380
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:25,870
So...

2381
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:27,910
It's really cool!

2382
01:45:27,970 --> 01:45:28,710
It's really fun!

2383
01:45:29,050 --> 01:45:29,850
And they have...

2384
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:30,970
They... I wonder if...

2385
01:45:30,970 --> 01:45:31,970
Let me see if I can find it.

2386
01:45:32,070 --> 01:45:32,330
Let's see.

2387
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:33,330
Sample...

2388
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:36,710
Japan food sample...

2389
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:37,330
Workshop?

2390
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:38,730
I don't even know what to search.

2391
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:41,390
Food sample making workshop in Tokyo.

2392
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:41,990
Oh my gosh!

2393
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:44,110
Wait, it just took...

2394
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:45,590
It was so easy to search.

2395
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:48,970
I don't know if this is the exact place that I did it at, but...

2396
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:54,410
Is that some place in Ikebukuro?

2397
01:45:56,370 --> 01:45:57,970
I don't remember where I went to.

2398
01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:01,590
Maybe this is it.

2399
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:03,150
Hmm.

2400
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:05,630
But yeah.

2401
01:46:05,830 --> 01:46:07,470
I guess you can book it as a...

2402
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:09,130
And then they also have the gift shop.

2403
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:10,010
So if you're just like...

2404
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:12,830
Oh, we made this thing, but I want to make this at home.

2405
01:46:12,910 --> 01:46:15,690
Like, I bought a melon soda one.

2406
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:16,290
So...

2407
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:18,410
Yeah.

2408
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:24,750
I recommend that kind of experience.

2409
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:25,590
It's so fun!

2410
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:26,450
It's so fun!

2411
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:32,190
It's so fun!

2412
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:32,730
It's my...

2413
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:34,010
Osusume.

2414
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:35,890
Remember?

2415
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:37,050
We said Osusume?

2416
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:38,890
What is this?

2417
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:42,010
There's no menu there, so...

2418
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:43,230
Icicle here.

2419
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:45,910
These...

2420
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:48,610
These places always have this specific ice cream cone.

2421
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:51,210
Gosh.

2422
01:46:52,570 --> 01:46:54,650
Just leaving their sumaho outside.

2423
01:46:57,470 --> 01:47:01,350
How do I get coins?

2424
01:47:02,470 --> 01:47:03,190
Oh, sticker.

2425
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:05,350
Sticker.

2426
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:06,010
Sticker.

2427
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:07,950
Soft cream.

2428
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:10,070
Soft cream.

2429
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:12,510
What flavor do you like?

2430
01:47:15,070 --> 01:47:15,870
Haru.

2431
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:17,650
Hagashu.

2432
01:47:18,290 --> 01:47:19,090
Chisai.

2433
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:22,950
Try a different mode.

2434
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,790
Oh, these are all our pictures!

2435
01:47:28,010 --> 01:47:28,630
Numbers!

2436
01:47:28,810 --> 01:47:29,730
Cute!

2437
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:32,470
Oh, wow!

2438
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:35,490
Here's all your hiragana and katakana.

2439
01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:37,230
Hiragana dakuten.

2440
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:38,210
Katakana dakuten.

2441
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:39,510
Wow!

2442
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:40,970
Numbers!

2443
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:42,510
Oh!

2444
01:47:43,610 --> 01:47:44,530

That's important.

2493
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:59,630
Cause shumatsu is awesome, baby.

2494
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:01,670
Complicated kanji.

2495
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:02,630

2502
01:49:11,550 --> 01:49:14,530
Very informal way of saying you and sounds very rude.

2503
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:17,370
Omae.

2504
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:20,770

Sounds pretty genki to me.

2522
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:02,280
Play it up a little bit more samu.

2523
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:06,600
Hana-chan wa doko desu ka?

2524
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,420
Hana-chan wa doko desu ka?

2525
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:09,700

Oh, sorry.

I just heard a dog bark.

2534
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,840
Did I imagine that?

2535
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,040
Did a dog...

2536
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,760

2547
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:01,940
Please, do not feed me.

2548
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:05,580

Oh, it says right.

Pay the exact amount.

2564
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:39,980
You got their gummies.

2565
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:41,000
It's just...

2566
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:41,400
It's a...

2567
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,100
It's a pun on tobacco.

2568
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,940
It's even like the same...

2569
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:48,360
Same kind of font that they use in Japan all the time.

2570
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:49,880
Thanks for the coin.

2571
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,300

Murphy, thanks for the coin.

2574
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,980
Doggo can't do math.

2575
01:51:57,980 --> 01:51:59,080
No, doggo...

2576
01:51:59,080 --> 01:51:59,900
Wait, who...

2577
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:00,540
Ok.

2578
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:01,820
I'm sorry.

2579
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:04,800
Who spent 1,500 yen?

2580
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,040
How much would that be now?

2581
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,300
How much would that be now?

2582
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:17,140
130 dollars?

2583
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:20,240
110 dollars?

2584
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:25,860
Well, who spent over 100 dollars on snacks?

2585
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:28,760
I would too though.

2586
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:29,820
He's a good boy.

2587
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:31,420
He's such a good boy.

2588
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:35,380
He's such a good boy, they do.

2589
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:37,220
They do.

2590
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:37,940
Sorry.

2591
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,980
What was I doing though?

2592
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:47,540
I was doing something and then I got distracted.

2593
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:54,280
Was I still looking at the samples?

2594
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:56,360
No, I closed out of that.

2595
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:01,240
I don't remember what I was doing.

2596
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,600
Sunny is atashi, so isn't the dog a girl?

2597
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,240
Oh, you're probably right!

2598
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:15,440
Oh, someone's... Oh yes, that's right!

2599
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:16,260
We were going through here!

2600
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:17,040
I was like...

2601
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:18,660
Thank you!

2602
01:53:23,770 --> 01:53:24,570
Where is Yuki-chan?

2603
01:53:24,570 --> 01:53:24,610
Where is Yuki -chan?

2605
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:36,000
I want Yuki to become a Vtuber, she's so cute!

2606
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:44,040
Oh, we have some vocabulary.

2607
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:57,560
Making sentences...

2608
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:00,800

2609
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:05,220

Wait, I think I need to turn the... Oh my god.

2616
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:23,030
Sorry, the voices are so low.

2617
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:26,570
Let's turn it up just a little bit.

2618
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:30,850
There we go.

2619
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:36,750
Wait, is that a voice changer?

2620
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:44,430
She's so cute!

01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:13,300
You are the photographer.

01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:16,260
Yeah, I'm Mito.

Yeah, it's amazing!

2629
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:29,720
What's scary?

2630
01:55:30,740 --> 01:55:32,400
Why is she scary?

2631
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:35,500
Yuki is scary, but Mito is scary!

2632
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:45,360
Wow!

2633
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:45,620
Wow!

2634
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:49,040
The photographer is cool, isn't he?

2635
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:52,000
Wow!

2636
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,500
Wow!

2637
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:13,060
The photographer is cool, isn't he?

2638
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,700
I am Yuki.

2639
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:17,500
I am 5 years old.

2640
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:18,400
Oh, no.

2641
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:21,540
I am stealing her identity.

2642
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:26,660
I am Mint.

Wow!

2652
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:58,440
The photographer is cool, isn't he?

2653
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:00,060

01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,640

2656
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:04,760
I am a robot.

01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:12,560
I am 5 years old.

2659
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:14,980
I am Yuki.

2660
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:19,420
Mint isn't just a child at heart anymore?

2661
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,300
Makingッa All right.

2662
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:28,400
can't miss this scene.

2663
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:30,660
Nice to meet you.

2664
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:31,400
I am Tom.

2665
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:32,960
I am a photographer.

2666
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,400
Please allow me to be your photographer.

2667
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,580
All right, all right.

2668
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:40,920
I'm done.

2669
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:41,320
I'm done.

2670
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,620
I'm done.

2671
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:44,660
I'm done.

2672
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:46,280
Oh, no!

2673
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:46,980
There's some more!

2674
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:49,180
Everyone.

2675
01:57:49,420 --> 01:57:50,420
I have prepared dinner.

2676
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:55,100
Sam, do you like curry rice?

2677
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:57,800
Yes, I like it.

2678
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:59,660
Yes, I like it.

2679
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:01,340
Wow, he sounded...

2680
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:03,920
Yes, I like it.

2681
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:07,420
Oh my gosh, I don't think he was saying that about the curry.

2682
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,540
That sounded more like...

2683
01:58:09,540 --> 01:58:11,180
Yes, I like it.

2684
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:12,720
Like...

2685
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:16,180
That sounded like a confession to me, right?

2686
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:18,100
Yes, I like it.

2687
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,540
I think he likes Hana.

2688
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:22,200
It's my favorite food.

2689
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,260
It's my favorite food.

2690
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:25,780
It's my favorite food.

2691
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:27,100
Then, itadakimasu.

2692
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:28,740
Itadakimasu.

2693
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,980
It's delicious.

2694
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:32,440
Yes, it's delicious.

2695
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:34,860
Gochisousamadeshita.

2696
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:36,800
Gochisousamadeshita.

2697
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:40,160
Yes, I like it.

2698
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,680
Oh my god, I'm gonna be listening to this just like...

2699
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:45,980
I feel a little bit lonely.

2700
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:47,520
Samusan, do you...

2701
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,320
What do you think about me?

2702
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:51,180
Yes, I like you.

2703
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:54,920
Oh my god, Samusan.

2704
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:57,200
It's too early, we just met today.

2705
01:59:07,190 --> 01:59:09,050
Samusan, konichiwa, konichiwa.

2706
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:11,190
Isho ni nanika shimasenka?

2707
01:59:12,170 --> 01:59:13,650
He's asking her on a date.

2708
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:15,690
Isho ni nanika shimasenka?

2709
01:59:16,030 --> 01:59:17,470
Kyou wa hima desu.

2710
01:59:18,230 --> 01:59:19,330
Watashi mo desu.

2711
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:21,750
Atarashii hon wo kaitai desu.

2712
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:22,030
Oh.

2713
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:25,050
Chikaku ni honyasan wa arimasu ka?

2714
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:26,230
Un.

2715
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:28,730
Koko kara jyūgo fun kurai desu.

2716
01:59:29,070 --> 01:59:30,570
Wow, there's so...

2717
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:31,610
We're on page 24.

2718
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:35,130
Let's buy a book.

2719
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:41,210
Are you gonna buy this book?

2720
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:42,230
Un, kau.

2721
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:46,570
Oh, oh.

2722
01:59:46,650 --> 01:59:47,930
Rival, rival, rival.

2723
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:51,030
Wait, oh no, that's the tei-in-san.

2724
01:59:52,190 --> 01:59:53,290
The tei-in-san.

2725
01:59:58,610 --> 02:00:03,770
We can't see the rival?

2726
02:00:03,950 --> 02:00:04,510
There he is.

2727
02:00:05,610 --> 02:00:06,830
There he is, there he is.

2728
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:09,290
What, is my head too big or something?

2729
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17,110
Oh my gosh.

2730
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:19,950
Oh my gosh, this is actually so helpful.

2731
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:21,730
Oh my gosh, this is actually so helpful.

2732
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:22,070
Wow.

2733
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:23,870
Oh, and then it stops there.

2734
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:26,330
But that's a lot.

2735
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:31,370
That's a lot of stuff that they...

2736
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:34,750
That they include in this.

2737
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:37,670
I'm actually so impressed.

2738
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:41,110
Bye bye ritsu.

2739
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:41,590
Bye bye.

2740
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:46,270
Wow, beautiful.

2741
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:48,770
Oh wait.

2742
02:00:48,770 --> 02:00:51,130
There we go.

2743
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:51,330
Cho.

2744
02:00:51,690 --> 02:00:52,270
Cho.

2745
02:00:53,990 --> 02:00:55,290
Capture a butterfly.

2746
02:00:55,850 --> 02:00:57,650
Oh, there's an achievement for it.

2747
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:58,450
Wait, what's this?

2748
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,550
Oh.

2749
02:01:02,330 --> 02:01:02,910
Tegami.

2750
02:01:03,610 --> 02:01:04,190
Tegami.

2751
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:08,410
Kaku.

2752
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:09,170
Okuru.

2753
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:10,330
Shiteki.

2754
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:17,120
Gotta answer the point card question with daijoubu desu.

2755
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:18,520
So you skip the next question.

2756
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:19,560
Wait.

2757
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:23,580
If they say do you have a point card, you can't say daijoubu desu.

2758
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:26,400
Just say...

2759
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:30,520
Are you saying like, oh they're gonna ask you if you wanna make one?

2760
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:31,920
Right?

2761
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:38,820
Daijoubu desu.

2762
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,700
Why are you spying on other people's mail?

2763
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:48,060
Because I'm a snoop.

2764
02:01:49,020 --> 02:01:50,320
I gotta get all these pictures.

2765
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,840
I have all these pictures to take.

2766
02:01:57,030 --> 02:02:00,410
Though I answered daijoubu desu to probably 99% of them.

2767
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:01,530
I answered daijoubu desu to probably 99% of them.

2768
02:02:01,530 --> 02:02:02,570
I answered daijoubu desu to probably 99% of them.

2769
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:07,110
Oh my god.

2770
02:02:07,150 --> 02:02:08,290
Square watermelon.

2771
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:10,270
Suika.

2772
02:02:12,090 --> 02:02:12,650
Kudamono.

2773
02:02:13,930 --> 02:02:14,490
Chokusuru.

2774
02:02:15,230 --> 02:02:15,790
Dekai.

2775
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:18,530
Look how expensive it is though.

2776
02:02:18,530 --> 02:02:20,390
Oh my gosh.

2777
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:22,770
It's so dang expensive.

2778
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:29,590
Carrots.

2779
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:32,210
You guys, I ate a whole bag of carrots.

2780
02:02:32,850 --> 02:02:33,430
Recently.

2781
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:35,370
Ninjin.

2782
02:02:35,490 --> 02:02:37,150
I ate all of them in one day.

2783
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:39,530
I love carrots.

2784
02:02:40,630 --> 02:02:41,210
Yasai.

2785
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:42,990
Kenkouteki.

2786
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:46,090
I ate them all because they're kenkouteki.

2787
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:47,230
They're healthy.

2788
02:02:48,450 --> 02:02:50,150
Can you see in the dark now?

2789
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:52,930
Can you see in the dark now?

2790
02:02:52,930 --> 02:02:53,570
Just carrots?

2791
02:02:53,890 --> 02:02:54,010
Just carrots?

2792
02:02:56,050 --> 02:02:57,910
Some with hummus.

2793
02:02:57,970 --> 02:02:58,170
Some with hummus.

2794
02:02:58,310 --> 02:03:00,110
But mostly just by themselves.

2795
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:03,610
Saibaisuru.

2796
02:03:03,850 --> 02:03:03,890
Saibaisuru.

2797
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:07,310
Hoya da daikon.

2798
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:10,810
Hoya da daikon.

2799
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:11,350
Daikon.

2800
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:13,770
That's a nice radish.

2801
02:03:15,310 --> 02:03:16,810
That's a nice radish.

2802
02:03:16,810 --> 02:03:17,490
Harukiru.

2803
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:21,090
Mikan.

2804
02:03:22,570 --> 02:03:24,190
I love a mikan too.

2805
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:29,310
Mikan.

2806
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:33,610
Kudamono amai.

2807
02:03:33,690 --> 02:03:34,330
Marui.

2808
02:03:34,470 --> 02:03:37,370
I can also eat a whole bag of these in one day.

2809
02:03:38,610 --> 02:03:40,370
But then my stomach hurts.

2810
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:42,950
So I don't do it.

2811
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:44,690
Not often.

2812
02:03:44,730 --> 02:03:45,730
Only sometimes.

2813
02:03:46,810 --> 02:03:47,810
What about the choco chips?

2814
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:49,250
Okashi.

2815
02:03:50,770 --> 02:03:51,950
I'll get this one too.

2816
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:55,690
Arubaito osagashite...

2817
02:03:57,190 --> 02:03:58,130

2818
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:00,070
Arubaito.

2819
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:01,430
Osagashi.

2820
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:01,990
This is me.

2821
02:04:03,330 --> 02:04:04,990
I'm gonna go work at the grocery store.

2822
02:04:06,730 --> 02:04:09,430
Are you looking for a part-time job?

2823
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:13,010
A whole bag?

2824
02:04:13,010 --> 02:04:15,650
Yeah, I can eat a whole bag.

2825
02:04:17,910 --> 02:04:19,890
Bonsho chuu desu.

2826
02:04:19,890 --> 02:04:20,050

02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,120
Mabashi Burando.

2828
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:30,680
Horse.

2829
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:33,730
Horse.

2830
02:04:35,740 --> 02:04:36,680
Horse.

2831
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:44,720
Horse.

2832
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:49,200
Horse.

2833
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:49,320
Horse.

2834
02:04:49,620 --> 02:04:50,560
Horse.

2835
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:50,860
Horse.

2836
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:56,960
What is this one?

2837
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:00,740
Something something chui.

2838
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:02,160
Go...

2839
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:04,680
Go kata?

2840
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:06,320
Goho?

2841
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:07,560
Chui?

2842
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:09,080
I don't know.

2843
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:10,840
Koho...

2844
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:13,200
Koho janai no.

2845
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,240
Koho chui.

2846
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:16,900
Oh my god.

2847
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,240
I'm nothing jozu.

2848
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:22,740
I'm nothing jozu.

2849
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:25,420
I'm nothing jozu.

2850
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:26,260
Nothing jozu at all.

2851
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:27,940
Nothing jozu about it.

2852
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,260
Wait, actually...

2853
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:32,060
Can I get a picture of the ajisai in the...

2854
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:32,960
in the rain?

2855
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:34,400
Oh my gosh...

2856
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:40,180
Why did it have to turn dark?

2857
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:48,620
Wait...

2858
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:50,800
Oh, I want a picture of the train too.

2859
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:53,340
Guess we'll wait for it to come back.

2860
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:53,820
Guess we'll wait for it to come back.

2861
02:05:55,380 --> 02:05:56,420
Sorry everybody.

2862
02:05:57,100 --> 02:05:57,640
I gotta get my shot.

2863
02:05:59,620 --> 02:06:00,500
Sorry everybody.

2864
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:01,740
I gotta get my shot.

2865
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:04,000
I want the moon in it also.

2866
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:06,800
I gotta get my shot.

2867
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:14,540
Pachinko!

2868
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:15,980
Sora.

2869
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,260
No, no, no, no.

2870
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:23,300
Delete, delete.

2871
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:24,860
It doesn't pause.

2872
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:32,840
Densha.

2873
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,040
What a terrible photo.

2874
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:39,560
What the...

2875
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:40,160
Oh!

2876
02:06:40,940 --> 02:06:41,580
Sora.

2877
02:06:47,350 --> 02:06:47,990
Densha.

2878
02:06:48,110 --> 02:06:50,310
Yeah, we got the pachinko in the background.

2879
02:06:50,490 --> 02:06:50,890
Nice.

2880
02:06:52,710 --> 02:06:53,970
Nice, nice, nice.

2881
02:06:54,470 --> 02:06:55,390
Is that lighting?

2882
02:06:55,630 --> 02:06:57,470
I don't know what that was, to be honest.

2883
02:06:57,970 --> 02:06:58,430
Noru.

2884
02:06:59,010 --> 02:06:59,650
Oriru.

2885
02:07:01,130 --> 02:07:01,770
Hayai.

2886
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:06,890
Pachinko.

2887
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:09,670
Pachinko.

2888
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:10,730
Kanban.

2889
02:07:12,770 --> 02:07:13,410
Dang.

2890
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:15,050
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2891
02:07:16,110 --> 02:07:17,290
Hikouki, hikouki.

2892
02:07:18,190 --> 02:07:19,470
Hikouki, hikou.

2893
02:07:21,910 --> 02:07:22,550
Hikouki.

2894
02:07:23,850 --> 02:07:24,490
Hikouki.

2895
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:25,310
Hikouki.

2896
02:07:25,370 --> 02:07:25,450
Hikouki.

2897
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:26,810
Tooi.

2898
02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:27,710
Toubu.

2899
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:29,430
Ryokou ni iku.

2900
02:07:32,250 --> 02:07:34,410
Remember the rule of thirds.

2901
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:36,650
Remember the rule of thirds.

2902
02:07:36,650 --> 02:07:37,710
Didn't it highlight the sky?

2903
02:07:37,710 --> 02:07:40,130
Oh, I've already taken a picture of the sky.

2904
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:42,050
You can see it.

2905
02:07:42,130 --> 02:07:42,930
It's hard to tell.

2906
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:44,170
I can't show my mouse on it.

2907
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:44,830
But it says Sora.

2908
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:47,630
Uh-oh.

2909
02:07:47,870 --> 02:07:51,030
We're causing a pile up here.

2910
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:52,430
Sorry, everybody.

2911
02:07:52,650 --> 02:07:52,970
Go ahead.

2912
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:55,570
I'm not sorry.

2913
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:57,290
I'm not sorry.

2914
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:00,410
Right?

2915
02:08:00,530 --> 02:08:01,990
We're not sorry at all.

2916
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:05,750
We're ready to cause chaos.

2917
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:08,050
In this little town.

2918
02:08:09,710 --> 02:08:10,950
Can we go downstairs?

2919
02:08:12,490 --> 02:08:13,010
No.

2920
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:14,710
Oh, yes.

2921
02:08:14,730 --> 02:08:15,450
This is where the...

2922
02:08:16,270 --> 02:08:17,250
Okosama no...

2923
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:19,310
The, um...

2924
02:08:19,310 --> 02:08:21,710
Their meal is free for the kids.

2925
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:23,410
Okosama menu.

2926
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,460
Do you guys feel really Nihongo jozu now?

2927
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:34,180
Do you guys feel like you've learned so much?

2928
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:36,240
I think I might actually call it here.

2929
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:37,820
I know it's like super duper...

2930
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:39,980
super duper short stream.

2931
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:42,540
But my throat is hurting...

2932
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:43,360
quite a bit.

2933
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:45,440
So...

2934
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:46,340
Sure do.

2935
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:48,940
Wait, hold on.

2936
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:52,180
Let's get the perfect photo of Fujisan first.

2937
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:53,140
Excuse me!

2938
02:08:53,780 --> 02:08:55,200
You are hindering my photo.

2939
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:05,540
Let it be a little...

2940
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:07,640
bit lighter.

2941
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,440
See, it's kind of...

2942
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:10,940
twilight.

2943
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:12,780
Fujisan.

2944
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,240
Slightly more jozu.

2945
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:19,460
Fujisan.

2946
02:09:24,140 --> 02:09:25,640
Nihongo peko peko desu.

2947
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:28,680
Anzen daichi.

2948
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:29,900
Anzen daisan!

2949
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:32,940
Hello?

2950
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:33,880
Is it gonna...

2951
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:36,380
become daytime?

2952
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:41,220
Yama.

2953
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:42,820
Oh yeah, see?

2954
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:43,700
Before it was raining.

2955
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:51,100
Fujiyama dekaiyama.

2956
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:52,820
Dekaiyama!

2957
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,180
Dai san.

2958
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:00,860
Shanshin daichi.

2959
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:03,180
Satsuei daichi.

2960
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:06,000
Anzen daisan.

2961
02:10:06,260 --> 02:10:07,920
Dai nii wa...

2962
02:10:10,140 --> 02:10:11,760
What is dai nii?

2963
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:13,720
Dai nii wa...

2964
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:22,280
Dai nii wa moe.

2965
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:26,100
Sugoi dekai Fujisan.

2966
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:26,560
Oh!

2967
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:28,520
Yama.

2968
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:33,760
Yeah, baby!

2969
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,440
We got the ultimate photo.

2970
02:10:40,540 --> 02:10:41,180
Yama.

2971
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:42,500
No, let me see it.

2972
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:42,900
Yama.

2973
02:10:43,240 --> 02:10:44,680
I'm gonna heart the Yama.

2974
02:10:46,240 --> 02:10:46,980
Hmm hmm.

2975
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:50,100
Maruku nai?

2976
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:53,620
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm.

2977
02:10:53,620 --> 02:10:53,840
Wow.

2978
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:57,360
It's so beautiful.

2979
02:10:58,520 --> 02:10:59,560
Utsukushi keshiki.

2980
02:11:00,980 --> 02:11:01,500
Arigato!

2981
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:04,180
This was a comfy stream game.

2982
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:07,180
Honestly, it looks more useful than the Green Owl app for learning Nihongo.

2983
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:07,880
Have a good rest.

2984
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:08,720
Thank you!

2985
02:11:09,180 --> 02:11:10,040
Aka Fuji!

2986
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:14,840
Look at that little cat.

2987
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:15,400
So cute.

2988
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:18,480
Yeah, I'm actually so shocked at how...

2989
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:21,160
I feel like how effective this is.

2990
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,100
Oh my gosh!

2991
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:25,060
Do you see it?

2992
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:27,200
Even the kanji is in the...

2993
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:31,540
Look how cool that is!

2994
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:33,620
Wow, what a beautiful picture.

2995
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:36,320
Oh, I missed the shot.

2996
02:11:39,740 --> 02:11:40,840
I missed the shot.

2997
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:42,640
I want another car to...

2998
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:44,100
Wait, what am I highlighting?

2999
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:45,680
Super!

3000
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:45,760
Super!

3001
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:54,600
I'd love to see this game grow.

3002
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:55,060
Me too!

3003
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:56,860
Me too, honestly.

3004
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:02,880
I think it'd be great for like, especially kind of the kanji you see in everyday Japan.

3005
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:05,120
I think.

3006
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:09,460
Super duper helpful.

3007
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:17,940
Come on car.

3008
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:18,400
Go!

3009
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:20,420
Turn, turn, turn, turn!

3010
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:22,300
Turn down the streetcar.

3011
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:24,540
Someone turn down the street.

3012
02:12:24,640 --> 02:12:24,840
Go home.

3013
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,240
Did someone say super?

3014
02:12:26,500 --> 02:12:27,140
Super?

3015
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:27,640
No!

3016
02:12:28,740 --> 02:12:29,960
Wrong super!

3017
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:31,960
Wrong word.

3018
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:33,140
Oh!

3019
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:35,780
Oh my god.

3020
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:37,480
Kuruma.

3021
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:38,720
There.

3022
02:12:38,980 --> 02:12:40,760
A very like...

3023
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:44,280
Japanese-like picture.

3024
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,480
So Japanese.

3025
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:46,560
Japanese.

3026
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,860
They need an N2 version of the game.

3027
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:52,180
Yeah.

3028
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:53,500
Yeah.

3029
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:54,840
It's a...

3030
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,660
Yeah, just like having...

3031
02:13:03,940 --> 02:13:04,380
Everything...

3032
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:06,680
I don't know even what N2 would be like though.

3033
02:13:06,700 --> 02:13:08,980
It would be so intensive, right?

3034
02:13:09,100 --> 02:13:13,380
It would be like every individual thing, right?

3035
02:13:14,860 --> 02:13:15,300
Hmm...

3036
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:19,640
But it looks like almost that they want to add more maps.

3037
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:21,340
You know, because...

3038
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:23,380
I mean, they have this area...

3039
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:24,340
Oh wait, can you get the fish?

3040
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:26,880
Fish!

3041
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:27,300
Fish!

3042
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:30,960
Swim.

3043
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:32,020
Swim.

3044
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:33,360
In the water.

3045
02:13:38,120 --> 02:13:39,620
It's kind of a bad picture, but it's okay.

3046
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:42,280
Pretty much hence the invisible wall.

3047
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:43,700
Fish!

3048
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:47,060
Vocab is pretty good, Ayamo.

3049
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:47,640
I think so too!

3050
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:49,760
I think it's really, really good.

3051
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:50,740
Yeah.

3052
02:13:55,120 --> 02:13:56,060
Oh my god, wait!

3053
02:13:58,360 --> 02:13:59,300
So cute!

3054
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:02,340
Wait, is this the cat from over here?

3055
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:03,020
No!

3056
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:04,780
There's just cats everywhere.

3057
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:14,800
Now focus on the cat.

3058
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:19,900
Wait, I don't...

3059
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:22,240
I wish I could lift it up a little bit more.

3060
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:24,300
But it goes out of...

3061
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:25,960
There we go.

3062
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:27,400
Oh no!

3063
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:29,420
I clicked the wrong thing.

3064
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:35,060
Okay, once more Sakura fall and then we'll be...

3065
02:14:35,060 --> 02:14:35,840
Nyanco.

3066
02:14:37,740 --> 02:14:38,300
Nyanchan.

3067
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:40,200
What's the cat doing?

3068
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:40,760
He's...

3069
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:41,960
He's...

3070
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:47,480
He's contemplating his life choices.

3071
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:48,660
Don't do it, cat!

3072
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:50,720
Don't do it, cat!

3073
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:50,800
Don't do it, cat!

3074
02:14:55,580 --> 02:14:58,020
I pressed left click but it didn't work.

3075
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:02,180
Yeah, he's Hanami right now.

3076
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:04,040
Hanami.

3077
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:05,340
No!

3078
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:07,920
Wait.

3079
02:15:08,180 --> 02:15:11,560
Oh, it's not letting me take a picture because I'm not focused on something.

3080
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:12,080
Wait.

3081
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:15,540
Oh, that's a terrible picture.

3082
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:18,260
That's a terrible picture.

3083
02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:20,420
Kawa.

3084
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:24,360
Kawa.

3085
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:25,480
Kawa.

3086
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:28,280
Kawa.

3087
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:29,020
Can I get this one too?

3088
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:30,440
Is this a bridge actually?

3089
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:30,960
I can't tell.

3090
02:15:31,480 --> 02:15:32,340
I guess not.

3091
02:15:33,540 --> 02:15:36,400
I was hoping it would let me take a picture of the bridge but...

3092
02:15:38,380 --> 02:15:38,780
Hmm.

3093
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:39,560
Okay.

3094
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:43,320
Yeah, I'm really sorry for the super duper short stream today.

3095
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:44,420
Yeah, I'm really sorry for the super duper short stream today.

3096
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:55,000
But I just really wanted something kind of chill that we could explore around a little bit and learn some Nihongo and hang out for just a bit.

3097
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,780
And hopefully you learned something.

3098
02:15:58,500 --> 02:15:58,980
Hopefully.

3099
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:01,880
Thanks for the chill stream.

3100
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:03,040
Of course, of course.

3101
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:09,120
If you're wanting to learn Japanese, I actually recommend this so much because look at this.

3102
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:15,100
You can go to a sign and you can be like, this looks like something that you would see totally normally.

3103
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:22,580
And so if you're just like, uh, uh, uh, uh, like, uh, what does this mean?

3104
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,020
You know?

3105
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:29,380
It's, uh, super duper helpful.

3106
02:16:30,240 --> 02:16:30,760
Hmm.

3107
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,660
It was fun and educational.

3108
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:33,920
Yes.

3109
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:35,640
Educational.

3110
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:36,140
Yes.

3111
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:37,560
Yes.

3112
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:42,720
I want to play this game so bad and I'm N3.

3113
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,100
Do it!

3114
02:16:44,180 --> 02:16:47,820
Anyway, I think I mean, there were even some words that I was like, oh.

3115
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:50,780
And then for me, kanji is so bad that it helps me a lot.

3116
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:54,160
I learned today that mint is kawaii.

3117
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:56,860
That word wasn't in the game.

3118
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:58,500
Thanks for the chill stream.

3119
02:16:58,560 --> 02:17:00,160
Of course, of course, of course.

3120
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:03,580
Arigato, Minto-sensei.

3121
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:06,840
I'm not the sensei.

3122
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:07,360
Don't worry.

3123
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:09,620
This game is sensei.

3124
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:11,560
Wow, thanks for the fine gift and membership.

3125
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:12,480
Thank you.

3126
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:14,360
Oh!

3127
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:18,120
We almost died.

3128
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:21,460
We almost died.

3129
02:17:21,620 --> 02:17:22,780
We almost died again.

3130
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:23,360
Whoa!

3131
02:17:27,660 --> 02:17:29,200
I want to watch that.

3132
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:34,540
Spankenheim!

3133
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:36,680
Thanks for the 10.

3134
02:17:37,560 --> 02:17:38,780
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

3135
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:41,760
Thank you so much.

3136
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:43,180
April 26, baby.

3137
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:47,580
I do hope that they, there is like DLC for this game, but it's only for filters.

3138
02:17:48,700 --> 02:18:06,580
So hopefully they add more maps and I don't think I'll stream it again, obviously, because, you know, it's just, it seems more like a good way to study on your own and have an interactive way to study if you're more of that kind of person who like learns better by like being like,

3139
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:06,920
oh!

3140
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:08,040
Kutsu!

3141
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:10,460
Kutsu.

3142
02:18:10,460 --> 02:18:13,420
Like that, you know, then it could be really good.

3143
02:18:14,420 --> 02:18:14,860
Hakku.

3144
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:15,800
Hashiru.

3145
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:16,720
Usubu.

3146
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:19,080
Arigatou gozaimasu.

3147
02:18:19,140 --> 02:18:19,600
This was fun.

3148
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:20,140
Thank you, guys!

3149
02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:21,160
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3150
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:23,860
With more advanced Japanese words on certain maps.

3151
02:18:24,980 --> 02:18:26,300
I think it would be good.

3152
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:29,760
Still have to eat that, by the way.

3153
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:29,940
Oh!

3154
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:30,980
Look at the time!

3155
02:18:31,480 --> 02:18:32,180
Okay, everybody!

3156
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:33,520
Otsu mitou!

3157
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:34,720
Thank you.

3158
02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:39,680
Itterasai, everybody!

3159
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:41,840
Thank you for watching!

3160
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:43,300
Thank you for watching!

3161
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:46,000
That's all for today!

3162
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:58,820
Dodododo Dodododo Hotaru no Hikari Wado no yuuki Otsu mitou!

3163
02:18:58,940 --> 02:19:00,920
Otsu, Otsu mitou!

3164
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:04,960
The moon is beautiful, isn't it?

3165
02:19:05,480 --> 02:19:06,620
Bye bye!

3166
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:08,920
Bye bye bye bye bye bye Bye bye!

3167
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:10,160
Have a good night!

3168
02:19:10,340 --> 02:19:11,140
Bye bye!
