1
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,780
Andrego said you, wait, I didn't even recognize you.

3
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,120
Oh my gosh.

4
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,900
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted, and I will thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

5
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,200
What's happening?

6
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,500
What's happening?

7
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,120
I look at the chat.

8
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,460
I look away from the chat, I look back, and suddenly it's just all gifted.

9
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
Hello everybody!

10
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,100
Hi, hi, welcome in, welcome in.

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,980
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,300
Clover Pit!

14
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,020
Fake news!

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,580
Thank you so much for the time, Captain!

16
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,880

19
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,000

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,560
Hope you had a good weekend.

21
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,560
I had a great weekend.

22
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,360
I hope you guys had a good weekend too.

23
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,460
It's Monday.

24
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,820
Oh my gosh.

25
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,460

27
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,880

Thank you.

29
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,180
Congrats on hitting 420!

30
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,480
Thank you!

31
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,900
Now you're a green V2 for a more wisdom one.

32
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,800
Whoa.

33
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,720
Maybe I should have done a...

34
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:28,180

Wait, you went from...

37
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,400
You went from Shupogaki to the cutest picture ever.

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,020
You can't change it ever, ever, ever.

39
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,280
Yeah.

40
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:42,900
But we...

41
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,560
Why are there so many gifted?

42
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,220
I'm trying to talk to you guys.

43
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,260
And I'm just, thank you so much for the five gifted.

44
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,680
Thank you.

45
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,180
Thank you.

46
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,900
What about spicy fan art?

47
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,860
Okay, that's like...

48
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,660
That's like different, though.

49
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,800
Today's my birthday, Jesse!

50
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,800
Happy birthday!

51
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,300
Happy birthday.

52
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,460
Happy, happy birthday!

53
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,120
Happy, happy birthday!

54
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,480
Wow, we... What a start to the week, huh?

55
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,500
With gambling all my... All my afterlife savings away.

56
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,680
We're... Okay, today, guys, I'm determined.

57
00:07:26,860 --> 00:08:23,040
going to we are going to what's the word oh escape the room i really want to escape the room somehow i've been having some terrible luck in this game i've been having such bad luck i've been trying to test out like different different um how do you say like methods like i've been like you know i can't go maybe I can't go all in on lemons or all in on interest maybe I have to try some spicier combinations such as yeah different builds different builds such as like trying for like a full six six six demon build but I cannot ever figure it out I think I'm stupid or I just I don't pull what I need to.

58
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,740
I don't know.

59
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,580
We might have to try some different methods tonight.

60
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,800
Yeah.

61
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,720
I think there are a few build guides on stream.

62
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,940
I'm sure.

63
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,460
Or steam.

64
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,400
What did you say?

65
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
On steam.

66
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,080
I was like, not my stream.

67
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,140
Probably.

68
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,620
I think plain Wi-Fi might be too spotty for stream.

69
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,480
Murphy!

70
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Have a safe flight!

71
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,400
have a safe flight.

72
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,080
You're on the plane?

73
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,160
Wait, you can watch me on the plane?

74
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,660
Whoa.

75
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,000
Whoa.

76
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,640
You probably need a couple unlocks to make builds work.

77
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,540
I have many unlocks.

78
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,260
First of all, though, I wanted to... I actually...

79
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,140
Whoa, my mouse... Do you see that?

80
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,680
Or it's like not... Oh, there it is.

81
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:11,860
Okay.

82
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,420
My mouse...

83
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,820
No.

84
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,640
Sorry.

85
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,440
My mouse was disconnected.

86
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,380
But...

87
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:26,420
got the unlock all the cards I think this was the one

88
00:09:32,680 --> 00:10:00,280
of these this one was the last one I needed Joshua happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday but maybe we can just get lucky if you get the 666 you get the bones so maybe we can just get the bones early and grab the key and skedaddle.

89
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,260
Maybe.

90
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,900
We'll see.

91
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,920
Right.

92
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:04,860
Maybe.

93
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,140
I don't know.

94
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,480
So, I guess since we're just starting off, let's just do a normal card.

95
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,160
Wait, hold on one second.

96
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,500
I forgot to check something too.

97
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,280
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

98
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:50,020
I'm ready to gamble my money away and i'm ready to get hit it big today and i'm ready to escape this place and i'm ready to become the richest ghost in the afterworld let's go gambling hoi okay we see we already got

99
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,280
we already got an arm Let's see.

100
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
I'm thinking of grabbing that green pepper.

101
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,200
I'm thinking of grabbing it.

102
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,220
Gambling.

103
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,260
Hmm.

104
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,280
What a beautiful song.

105
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,500
Thank you.

106
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,760
D4.

107
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,300
This is pretty good.

108
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,140
I'm not gonna lie.

109
00:11:25,200 --> 00:12:33,700
So I've also... I've tried a couple I've tried a couple builds I've tried like I've gotten builds before where I was like my green tickets my clover tickets were in like the hundreds I was like I was collecting tickets like a mad woman it was crazy I think though I think um either pepper or the d4 would be good to start with this thing this thing always it will sabotage you do not get disc C it's not worth it gambling time especially if it's like you have the thing where it's you i've so many times i'll have gotten a a jackpot and then it will override it and then it will take away my my jackpot and it's so mean it's so rude thank you so much for the free direct thank you thank you thank you if you want you can just buy more charms and toss in the drawers then reset for full bones wait what no

111
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,100
Rude!

112
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,410
Beep, beep, beep.

113
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,350
Again?

114
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,810
When life gives elevens, you gamble them away.

115
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,330
Not much bust, huh?

116
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,950
I swear, one day they'll make a bust of me.

117
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,850
I'll have my own bust.

118
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:01,950
And then you'll regret your words and your deeds.

119
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,670
I'll have my bust.

120
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,310
I'll have my bust.

121
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,090
I don't know if I should equip this or not.

122
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,390
I'll think about it.

123
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,340
Wait, did I...

124
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,160
Oh, so...

125
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,700
We basically made enough.

126
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,820
They'll call it a statue.

127
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,400
No, no, no, no, no, no.

128
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,760
to Minto.

129
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,100
It's November?

130
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
I don't believe in no nut November.

131
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,800
That goes against my principles.

132
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,020
Don't lose it all in one place, kiddo.

133
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,820
I'm gonna get a lollipop.

134
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,700
Thank you!

135
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,560
Non-stop nut November.

136
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,800
Something wrong with being medium premium.

137
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,320
Don't get mad at me.

138
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,500
Don't get mad at me.

139
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:27,360

140
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,700
Mint's bust finds.

141
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,920
No noise, November.

142
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,140
Can everybody shut up?

143
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,680
My neighbor got a dog.

144
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,640
I think that they think like, you know, the mid-cafe is abandoned.

145
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:53,040
So, they got a new dog, and the dog just is barking.

146
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,440
The dog is not trained.

147
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,560
And for the past like two hours, it has been nonstop barking.

148
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:08,060
And I don't think they do anything about it because again, they think that nobody lives here, except I am, I mean, they're technically right.

149
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,020
I'm not living, but I am existing here.

150
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,380
And the other annoying thing that they do is they leave.

151
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:24,080
So the dog is inside, but they leave their door, like they have like a, like a deck, you know, they leave the door open.

152
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:34,040
So I just hear the dog at full volume for so stinking long.

153
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,900
Just all

154
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:50,810
for, seriously, I'm not even exaggerating when I say it was today, it's been, it was about like two, two and a half hours of just non-stop barking.

155
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,910
It was so horrible.

156
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,090
Woof, woof, woof, woof.

157
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,790
I'm like, have a dog, that's fine, but just train them.

158
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,450
What do you guys think?

159
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,450
You think we should take him?

160
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,980
I don't think we should.

161
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,720
The barking is for me, sorry.

162
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,780
I believe that.

163
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,020
Should we take him or should we hold off?

164
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,340
Did your cats relax?

165
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,760
No, not really.

166
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,320
I did have my own door open, too, because I was like, It's fall weather.

167
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,000
It's a nice, I want the fall breeze.

168
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,020
And everything.

169
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,900
I had to shut my door because the dog was so loud.

170
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,120
Reset till you get full bones.

171
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,280
Really?

172
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,780
What?

173
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,880
Take the dog.

174
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,420
I don't want the dog.

175
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,300
Find you cute and funny.

176
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,700
So here's some money.

177
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,360
Do you mean to rhyme?

178
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,540
That's so silly.

179
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,340
Thank you.

180
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,540
Thank you so much.

181
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,140
Bones suck without the skull.

182
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,270
Okay, I'll hold off.

183
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,170
I'll hold off, I'll hold off.

184
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,890
Yeah, I heard it.

185
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,310
No neglect November.

186
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,830
Get Minky's neighbor to train their damn dogs.

187
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,370
So, so true!

188
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,870
Wow, wait, these are kind of great.

189
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,950
Okay.

190
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,010
I have no tickets though.

191
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,370
Maybe this one.

192
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,790
Let's get some more tickets in.

193
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,030
Way to have no tickets.

194
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,070
Well shoot, early megaphone.

195
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,290

00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,490
Very north.

207
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,410
Mimi.

208
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,870
Hi, Mimi.

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,830
I think so.

211
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,810
Is it my winning?

212
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,150
You think?

213
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,210

214
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,690

215
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,370

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,330
This is...

218
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,870
We're getting, we're getting literal pennies.

219
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:22,710
Whoa!

220
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,730

221
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,550
Oh my gosh, it was so close.

222
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,790
It was just a...

223
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,310
It's okay, you don't have to explain.

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:58,890

228
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:48,870
Oh, come on.

229
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,230
Sometimes the dice is useless.

230
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,550
Like, what are you doing?

231
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,710
What are we doing here?

232
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,950
I guess it's better to have a chance.

233
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,490
I could get the clicker.

234
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,650
I don't even know what kind of build I want to do.

235
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,550
Guys, I don't know.

236
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,370
Money.

237
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:36,090

239
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,530
I think I want to do another round, though.

240
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,050
Got you, girl?

241
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,810
I'm broke.

242
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,550
Me too.

243
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,130
Come on, Pepper.

244
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:01,850
Oh!

245
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,650
Pepper pulled through!

246
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,850
I love the sound of a jackpot!

247
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,470
Yippee!

248
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,310
Natasha broke.

249
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,710
I'm betting it all.

250
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,510
I mean, you are betting in the right place.

251
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,770
Bink, bink.

252
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:28,770
Stupid.

253
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,590
Bink, bink.

254
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,070
Deadline time.

255
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,750
Deadline time.

256
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,250
Guys, more often than not, it's really pathetic.

257
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:45,310
Like, I am very often just...

258
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,010
I'm very often losing in like the first two rounds.

259
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,950
It's pretty bad.

260
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,910
Like it's actually really terrible.

261
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,210
Let's see what we got.

262
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,810
Well, we'll grab this for some free tickets.

263
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,050
Actually, wait.

264
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,330
None of this was...

265
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,910
Well, that's fine.

266
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,530
It's by design, don't sweat it.

267
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,550
What's this one do?

268
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,770
Well, I think this guy would probably be good then, the toy train.

269
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,590
You hit the jackpot, I did, I did!

270
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,710
Symbol multiplier.

271
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,580
I still don't know what kind of build I want to go for.

272
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,820
I guess, yeah, the train doesn't synergize well with the D4.

273
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,960
That is true.

274
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,640
Oh, we could reroll, actually.

275
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,560
I have so much.

276
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,900
Let's re- wait.

277
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,240
Hmm.

278
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,680
What I might do is reroll.

279
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,100
We get something good.

280
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,360
Then I could deposit all my money that I could.

281
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,940
And then do this one.

282
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,280
That's what I'm thinking.

283
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,200
The Skull!

284
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,340
I actually like this guy a lot.

285
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,600
Especially at him with one of the discs.

286
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,800
Wait, what's this one?

287
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,840
666% chance.

288
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,660
Wait, no.

289
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,060
666 chance percent three.

290
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,600
I like that one.

291
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,840
Plus...

292
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,940
This one plus either like the coin...

293
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,960
Is good too.

294
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,720
Yeah, it is Jimbo.

295
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,920
It's good old Jimbo.

296
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,560
Zimbo.

297
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,460
Patterns multiplier.

298
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,320
Sevens manifest more often.

299
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,360
Hmm.

300
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,990
I could get the hamster.

301
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:02,370
Okay.

302
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,690
I'm gonna go with my plan then.

303
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,210
What I said.

304
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,110
So I'll deposit all my money.

305
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,270
And then...

306
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:09,790
Oh wait.

307
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,370
Set my coins to zero though.

308
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,930
Wait, I wouldn't be able to do a roll.

309
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,130
Um.

310
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,170
Home.

311
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,290
Okay.

312
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,180
you get one free spin if you have no money yeah i know you get the one free spin

313
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:43,890
i mean i think i'm like i would what have 400 i would just have to get 200 more

314
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:58,850
hmm no how do i want to do this i mean i could also always just go for the the base of the clover and the bell but lay

315
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:21,030

316
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:34,600

317
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,340
snail's pace this is literally when it is time.

318
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,140
No!

319
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,140
My pepper!

320
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,280
My pepper.

321
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,900
That was scary.

322
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,360
My pepper.

323
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,940
Beep, beep.

324
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,910
What happened to the pepper?

325
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,610
You can only use it a certain number of times.

326
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,230
Okay, what was I doing?

327
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,890
Oh, okay, I'm depositing my money.

328
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:15,910
Okay, hold on.

329
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,870
Order of operations.

330
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,510
We're gonna deposit all the money.

331
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,730
Set to get the double tickets.

332
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,090
Okay, all right, all right.

333
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:26,970
Deposit.

334
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,070
Oh, this is scary.

335
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,850
It's scary depositing it all.

336
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,070
Not enough cards.

337
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:34,390
Okay.

338
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,310
Double.

339
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,310
I always trusted your boss.

340
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,070
Minto losing.

341
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,630
Gambling is mathematically impossible.

342
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,570
Oh, Minto winning.

343
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,530
I always trusted you.

344
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,210
Minto losing.

345
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,910
Gambling is mathematically impossible to win.

346
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,170
So true!

347
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,670
It's never my fault!

348
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,890
It's never my fault!

349
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,410
It's never my fault!

350
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,150
It couldn't be!

351
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,450
The odds are always against us.

352
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,530
The odds are never in our favor!

353
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,270
Okay.

354
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,990
Let's go gambling!

355
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,930
It's always rigged, except when I win.

356
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,270
And then, it's just me being the lucky one.

357
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,470
duck out there.

358
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,170
This sucks!

359
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,510
Wait!

360
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,290
This is not good!

361
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:44,150
I want to

362
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,500
reroll, but I'm scared.

363
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,520
I won't have enough money.

364
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:53,740
Whoops.

365
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,360
You know what I mean?

366
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,140
Grab Jimbo?

367
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,820
Is it even... well, no.

368
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,620
The patterns multiplier maybe is pretty good, but...

369
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,100
I think I gotta risk it for the biscuit.

370
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,560
Don't reroll, resist the temptation.

371
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,740
I think I gotta risk it for the biscuit.

372
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,200
No!

373
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,260
I have to get, like, 150, you guys.

374
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,880
Okay, wait.

375
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,640
What do we have here?

376
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Oh!

377
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,020
Well, okay, okay, okay.

378
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,280
This one might be...

379
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,000
Wait.

380
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,120
Maybe I'll mushroom.

381
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,600
If we can even get to...

382
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,300
But this one has every last pattern triggered one more time, which might be good because we have the ham, so...

383
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,820
I don't know if we'll get another option at the telephone.

384
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,640
I don't know if we'll get it!

385
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:56,860
But...

386
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Let's just try.

387
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,950
I can only do what I can do!

388
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,730
I can only do what...

389
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,530
Am I getting a six?

390
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:07,570
Okay.

391
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,010
Okay, okay.

392
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,310
Guys, this might be bad.

393
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,850
This might be bad.

394
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:20,970
This might be bad.

395
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,230
This might be bad.

396
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,030
The game hates me.

397
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,440
Oh, lemons!

398
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,970
We didn't make it to another.

399
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,570
Okay, this is what I do in times of hardship.

400
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,270
Anka!

401
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,410
No, I need one more!

402
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:06,870
No!

403
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,390
No!

404
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,880
Oh, I should have put everything in the drawers.

405
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,640
You're so right.

406
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,160
I forgot.

407
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,120
Shoot.

408
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,940
Oh, well.

409
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:49,180
it's we'll lose another one for sure for sure we will lose one do we want to try a card i've tried some of them before but i'm also like a hoarder and i get scared i'm like i'm like oh no if i use it it disappears but this this one wait okay if i lose and stash everything in the drawers

410
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,340
Which I don't know what that is, but I want it.

411
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,680
I want whatever that golden knob is.

412
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,180
It says, for the rest of the run, the debt to reach is two times bigger.

413
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,420
If you manage to open the door, you'll get a golden knob.

414
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,100
I'm assuming.

415
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,560
I actually don't know if the skull key is to open the door.

416
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,260
So I don't know.

417
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,560
Yeah, I only have one try.

418
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:14,980
Exactly.

419
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,960
That's why it's scary.

420
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,340
I want the golden knob.

421
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,720
You have five of the golden...

422
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,500
That's true, this one.

423
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,220
This one's like so harmless.

424
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,820
Many memories, many lives!

425
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,540
Will we be able to get the door key?

426
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,620
Is it this?

427
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,760
You can spoil.

428
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,700
Is this the door key or is this the death key?

429
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,040
Let me out!

430
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,460
Oh, it is?

431
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,220
Okay.

432
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,720
That's the door key.

433
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,640
Look, this would be perfect if I had done, if I had, if I had stashed everything.

434
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,300
This would be the perfect run.

435
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,940
Wait, this would have been perfect.

436
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,180
If I had full, dang it.

437
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,820
It is if you don't use it to open a drawer.

438
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,040
But I have opened all the drawers, so.

439
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,680
That's the door key.

440
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,280
Bottom right is the door key.

441
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,740
Oh shut up!

442
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,560
I see something dorky in the bottom right.

443
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,780
Why are you guys so mean to me?

444
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,940
Um, actually...

445
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,600
What I'm gonna grab is... We'll grab the green pepper and then I'll grab wood.

446
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,460
I love wood.

447
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,350
They mean spooky.

448
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:01,730
True?

449
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,350
I love getting the multiplier.

450
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,430
That's why.

451
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,770
Yippee!

452
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,530
Just call me a beaver.

453
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,350
I'll be chomping on that wood.

454
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,700
Planks and boards?

455
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,300
Yeah?

456
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,200
Oh wow, wait, actually that was pretty good.

457
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,200
Maybe I'll do one more and then we can skip the rest.

458
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,240
Let's go gambling.

459
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,260
I like bells runs because they have a lot of good charms.

460
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,760
They do.

461
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,620
They really do.

462
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:08,080
I feel like I feel like fruit runs are fine until like you'll be like getting so good.

463
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:17,160
Like such good cash money and then suddenly the rate goes up so high that it's like impossible.

464
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,280
Why are we so mean to you?

465
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,760
The answer is obvious.

466
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,500
Cute aggression.

467
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,960
I forget that.

468
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,140
Sometimes I grab my cat's face and I shake it a little bit.

469
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,280
I think I'll skip so I can get the...

470
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,900
The extra...

471
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,500
Extra tickets.

472
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,500
Oh!

473
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,100
Wait a second.

474
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:49,980
Wait.

475
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,510
Um.

476
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:57,130
Wait.

477
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,650
Oh, I don't...

478
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,510
I don't know.

479
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,020
This compobulates affectionately.

480
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,900
Yeah, exactly.

481
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,880
The middle.

482
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,620
Oh, which one?

483
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,540
Oh, I'm so sorry.

484
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,280
I just realized.

485
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,180
You guys can't see.

486
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,800
I'll, like, go here or something.

487
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,400
Um...

488
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,860
This one's tough.

489
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,240
It's like, on the one hand, you don't need this in the very beginning.

490
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,160
You know?

491
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,920
The one hand, like, the increased charm space by one permanently is, like, great later on.

492
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,840
But at the beginning, it's kind of like...

493
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,940
It's an investment.

494
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,760
It's an investment.

495
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,320
But this one...

496
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,940
Let's see, hold on.

497
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,340
What lucky charms do we have?

498
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,280
Because I would probably grab this one.

499
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,180
And I would grab that one.

500
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,200
And then maybe this one?

501
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,280
Because then we could get the plus two tickets.

502
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,100
They are rare, yeah.

503
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,200
They are rare.

504
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,570
Little so that we can get the megaphone for extra charm space.

505
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,770
Do you see the megaphone here?

506
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,550
Because then I would be able to get multiple things, you know.

507
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:48,980
briefcase then re-roll i guess that's possible yeah oh yeah horizontal this is is like you know you have all these patterns so horizontal excel would be all the way across kind of like like all in the middle like that

508
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:59,030
megaphone will come okay i'm gonna buy this And then I'm gonna reroll.

509
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,310
And next will be the megaphone.

510
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,070
Trust, trust, trust.

511
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,970
Oh, more money!

512
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,290
Wait, okay, I'm gonna...

513
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,610
Wait, but then I won't...

514
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,310
Okay, I'm gonna buy this.

515
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,010
What?

516
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,630
I want the money.

517
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,410
Oh, wait.

518
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,870
We're pretty good, though.

519
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,390
I'm not gonna buy it.

520
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,210
I'm not gonna buy it.

521
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,730
I'm gonna re-roll.

522
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,710
Oh, disc B.

523
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,590
Disc B, my beloved.

524
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,320
Tickets more important than money, though.

525
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,260
I don't know if you know this, but I die if I don't have enough money.

526
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,440
Save up for the six.

527
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,860
I've never used this one before.

528
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,640
The crystal sphere.

529
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,560
Is it that good?

530
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,260
I guess, well, because I never go for diamonds and...

531
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,560
Diamonds and treasures and sevens.

532
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,220
What if I got the treasures manifest more often?

533
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,940
And then I got that.

534
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,020
But then if I discount it by two, I will be able to get it.

535
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,260
I think I should do the discount by two.

536
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,200
But if I get this...

537
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,900
I think I should... I know, I think I should do the treasures manifest more often.

538
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:33,860
Because, wait.

539
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,840
I will get three.

540
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,520
I will get three if I play all three rounds.

541
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,280
But then I could also get the luck seven.

542
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,980
I'd go with the one that controls odds more.

543
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,860
I think that's the better...

544
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,440
That's honestly a safer play.

545
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:54,620
Okay.

546
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,680
Okay, we do that.

547
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,460
Oh, don't buy that.

548
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,300
Don't buy that.

549
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,320
Okay.

550
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,740
I just have to be good.

551
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,140
Oh, I forgot to...

552
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,140
I forgot to deposit.

553
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:09,720
My bad.

554
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:17,940
Okay.

555
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,280
We're...

556
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,640
We're brain-edit-up.

557
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,400
The sound effects in this game are really nice.

558
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,980
They're so, like...

559
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,700
So close!

560
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,320
They're so punchy.

561
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,740
Like, it sounds so good.

562
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,220
I agree.

563
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,460
Oh my gosh.

564
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,000
So close to jackpot.

565
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,030
Biting.

566
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:49,350
In fact, I know for sure we can, yeah, but we'll do all three, obviously, so we can get the crystal ball.

567
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:55,750
Oh my gosh, this is gonna be my first time aiming for, for like, well, not my first time.

568
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,750
I have tried, like, other builds with, like, I've tried Clovers before.

569
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:11,590
But I think it's my first time with, I mean, it is my first time with the crystal ball.

570
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,050
Wow, that sucks.

571
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,030
Okay.

572
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,110
Okay.

573
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,930
This is how I feed my inexistent gambling.

574
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,150
I don't think it's...

575
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:26,970
It's exist...

576
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:27,870
It's existent.

577
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,170
Oh, wait.

578
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:29,630
Hold on.

579
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,430
One second, you guys.

580
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:30,790
I'm sorry.

581
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,750
Let me...

582
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,770
It's so hard finding a place to put my head here in this...

583
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,830
I'll just move...

584
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,790
I'll just be ahead right...

585
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,330
Actually, hold on.

586
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,770
Hold on.

587
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,270
I'm going to cut myself like this.

588
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,490
I'm going to chop off my body.

589
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,650
There we go.

590
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,810
Chop it off.

591
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:55,930
Chop it off.

592
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:56,790
Chop it off.

593
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,670
Oof with her body.

594
00:42:59,590 --> 00:42:59,730
Okay.

595
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:00,510
Okay.

596
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,970
Oh, oh, nice.

597
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,430
Oh,

598
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,100
this is kind of paying off.

599
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:25,200
off let's go oh my god she's gaming

600
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,800

602
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:30,420
But we could put all of our charms into the drawers and then do that if we're going for the other...

603
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,660
If we're going for the...

604
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,500
Treasures and diamonds and things.

605
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,980
Um, we could do the make two random charms store free.

606
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,080
Let's see.

607
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,300
What do we have?

608
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,640
Ancient coin.

609
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,840
Stain.

610
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,180
Hmm.

611
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,020
Manifesting jackpaws.

612
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:57,380
Let's go.

613
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,280
Thank you.

614
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,900
Got a great head on your shoulder.

615
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,420
I still have shoulders.

616
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,960
You can see it.

617
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,360
You can simply not take the red phone calls for the good ending.

618
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:13,620
What?

619
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,560
Huh?

620
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,100
Wait.

621
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,600
Wait.

622
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,520
Spoilers?

623
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,580
Sometimes I wish we could have Minto head bounce around screen like a DVD logo.

624
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,020
Yeah, that'll be fine.

625
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,860
Don't worry about it.

626
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,240
Wait, so if I skip three?

627
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,180
I do like how the voice on the phone goes, He he, he, he, welcome back.

628
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,380
Skip three?

629
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,040
back!

630
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,380
Be right back!

631
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,280
I also need to hit 666 three times.

632
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:11,760
What?

633
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:12,820
And one thing?

634
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,480
Oh.

635
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,020
But I have...

636
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,440
Honestly, my brain is so like...

637
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:27,240
The issue with these types of games is you can get pulled everywhere because you're just like, what should I go for?

638
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:27,580
You know?

639
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,420
Do I go for this?

640
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,440
Do I go for this?

641
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,640
Do I go... Do I go for the phone?

642
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,920
Do I go for the 666?

643
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,720
I go for the bodies.

644
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,880
What do I do?

645
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,840
You know, it's always just kind of like...

646
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:49,240
It's like you can have something that you want to try, but if you don't get the right pulls, then you're just like, ah, what do I do?

647
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,480
I just pull the lever.

648
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,560
So real.

649
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,160
So real.

650
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,060
So real.

651
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,440
Me too, though.

652
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,420
This is like one of those types of games.

653
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:13,640
that I truly will just have I'll just like play it and I kind of turn off my brain even though it's a very much of a brainy type of game

654
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,720
it's very much a brainy type of game but I just don't take

655
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:36,060
I just don't think or oh brand off gun by eye Exactly, exactly.

656
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,680
Trying to think if I want to re-roll the store.

657
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,860
We're little over halfway.

658
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,470
That's true that I have no tickets, but if we...

659
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:01,150
That's what I was looking for this one.

660
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:02,750
The middle one.

661
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,250
Even if it is random.

662
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:09,910
I'm thinking.

663
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:10,850
I'm thinking.

664
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,790
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

665
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,930
Okay, let's just...

666
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:17,270
I'll think.

667
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,890
I'll think while I pull the lever.

668
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,550
Thinking pull the lever.

669
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,360
So lame.

670
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,660
Goodbye, Pepper.

671
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,720
It's only Deadline 3 and my brain is already so like...

672
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,020
I'm curious what to do.

673
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:20,450
I'm gonna reroll once.

674
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:21,890
Whoa.

675
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:23,290
Soup.

676
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:29,070
Whatever five plus patterns you're doing, it's gonna double the value of all the symbols until the end of the round.

677
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,430
There's the seven.

678
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,950
more sevens and ace of diamonds.

679
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:40,550
Thank you for all here.

680
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:41,490
Thank you!

681
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,530
Thank you so much!

682
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,530
No thank only Paul.

683
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,610
Vinny soup.

684
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:54,430
Ew.

685
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:57,190
Wait hold on.

686
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,790
I might...

687
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,950
Go for the random lucky charm.

688
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:13,570
Free.

689
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,930
Oh wait, I have one currently.

690
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:17,230
One ticket.

691
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,110
I can't use it.

692
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,470
The Minto bust happened sooner than I thought.

693
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,050
See, I told you!

694
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,010
I told you all!

695
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:31,910
You would!

696
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,470
Regret your words!

697
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,630
You'll have two next round.

698
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,010
Yeah!

699
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,130
But there are so many of these cost a lot of money.

700
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,570
I think I will just...

701
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:49,970
I'm doing it!

702
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:55,160
Are you sure?

703
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,080
Why are you...

704
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,960
Oh, wait.

705
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,580
This might be okay.

706
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,660
They work out.

707
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,420
Dang, I wanted this one.

708
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,120
Oh, well.

709
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,260
Yes, boss.

710
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:09,780
Okay.

711
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,120
We can do this.

712
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,620
Let's go gambling.

713
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,380
Okay.

714
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,040
We're a bit of a snail's pace.

715
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,380
Can you call them back and ask for a refund?

716
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,620
I don't think they're not so kind.

717
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,820
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

718
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:36,860
Uh-oh.

719
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,580
Guys, I don't think we're...

720
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:41,820
Oh.

721
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:42,040
Oh.

722
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,500
Wait, I still have one round!

723
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,400
Oh my gosh, I thought that was it for me.

724
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,820
Wait, oh, I still have one more round!

725
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,240
I thought it was over!

726
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,380
I thought it was over!

727
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,320
It might be.

728
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,960
It might still be.

729
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,320
Oh yeah, six!

730
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,110
I...

731
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,770
It might be over for me.

732
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,680
Six!

733
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,480
Wait!

734
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,530
My interest!

735
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,170
My interest saved the-

736
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,050
I'm gonna have- I'm gonna be left with like a single coin.

737
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:04,610
20...

738
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,870
There's no way this is happening.

739
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:08,770
Sadly.

740
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:12,750
Bells manifest.

741
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,170
Wait, what is this one for?

742
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,490
Is it bells and whistles?

743
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,930
No, there's no bells.

744
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,030
Increase charm, space by one permanently.

745
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:23,850
Oh, sorry.

746
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,510
I'm still blocking it.

747
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,530
I give up.

748
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:32,710
I give up.

749
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,740
What if I just sit like this?

750
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,640
The whole time.

751
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,300
I'll just...

752
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,060
I'll be...

753
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,960
It's like I'm literally drowning in debt.

754
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,500
Bottom left.

755
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,580
Like this.

756
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,840
Guys, what do you think I should pick?

757
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:58,760
Okay.

758
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,900
Sit up, girl!

759
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,120
I can't!

760
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,300
I can't even stand up for myself.

761
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,480
Wait, hold on.

762
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,480
I'm gonna fix it.

763
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,300
I'm gonna do this real quick.

764
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,240
I'm gonna fix my setup.

765
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,020
There we go, okay.

766
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,720
There we go.

767
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,570
Perfect.

768
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:24,190
Okay.

769
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,570
The booster seat.

770
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,190
I don't think we'll make it.

771
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,450
So I'm just gonna increase our...

772
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,210
Actually, I'm...

773
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:34,490
Well, if...

774
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:34,610
Wait.

775
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,310
I have no idea.

776
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,490
I could do the value of the patterns.

777
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,150
Hmm.

778
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,820
I'll do this one because I think we need...

779
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,520
Even though I want more space, I think we need more luck.

780
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,060
I think we need everything else.

781
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,260
Let's go gambling.

782
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:14,350
Okay!

783
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:20,650
Four!

784
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:23,230
Uh-oh.

785
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:29,870
Uh-oh.

786
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:40,770
Four!

787
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,850
It was so nice knowing you all.

788
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:53,710
It was so nice knowing you all.

789
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,740
A captain always goes down with his ship.

790
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,700
Freak Phantasm.

791
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,580
Hope you have a great stream that you reached those 50 games by the end of the year.

792
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:08,880
Thank you!

793
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:09,700
Thank you.

794
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,540
I think we'll knock out a couple this week.

795
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,360
So...

796
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,560
What did that do?

797
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:25,250
Wee-wee...

798
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,090
What the money for?

799
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,450
Wee-wee-wee Please!

800
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:33,550
Ah!

801
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,810
Six!

802
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,750
Wee-wee-wee-wee Wee-wee

803
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:59,030
Wee-wee Oh, it's really terrible when you do a round and you can only deposit one time.

804
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:04,610
Wait, I should have...

805
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:07,790
I should have gotten this for the...

806
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,630
I don't think we're gonna make it, though.

807
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:11,850
Let's do...

808
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,030
Wait.

809
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,570
Yeah, I remember to store your stuff.

810
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,970
Yeah, I'm thinking, what if I do it right now?

811
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,690
I think I should just do it right now.

812
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:32,290
Buy some charms and store them.

813
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:33,770
Move aside, left side, Minto.

814
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,630
My new Ocee is left side, accurate size Minto.

815
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,390
Pass them on to the next Minto.

816
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,920
Well, I have enough time to do it.

817
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,180
I don't think I will have enough time to put all, what, two more in?

818
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,780
I don't think so.

819
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,640
I almost want to, like, keep this out just in case, you know.

820
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,780
You shouldn't?

821
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,260
It's just two, right?

822
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,220
So, does this count?

823
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,180
Has something in the drawers?

824
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,420
I'm feeling lucky.

825
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,120
I'm feeling lucky.

826
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:36,880
I wish this book was the one that when you get the 666 it makes your luck really big afterwards.

827
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,460
Oh my god, we haven't pulled a single thing.

828
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,080
I earned 10 coins, everybody.

829
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,200
Okay.

830
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,100
Let me deposit, please.

831
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,400
Put the drawer.

832
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:02,980
Put the drawer.

833
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,660
Okay, we should be good then.

834
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:15,860
Maybe we...

835
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,060
Oh, man.

836
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,680
Oh, man.

837
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,900
I'm not in control.

838
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,620
Oh, love.

839
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:37,760
My cat was sleeping in a sunbeam, and then she started growling and woke up.

840
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,300
How do you plan to take responsibility?

841
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:40,020
What?

842
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:40,580
Me?

843
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,940
I haven't been able to watch much because super busy work day.

844
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,860
What do I go?

845
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,220
He said, don't overlook at her.

846
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,480
Luck on this ramp plus a...

847
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,460
A safety loop to stay afloat.

848
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,820
But everyone's soul.

849
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,660
This is the one.

850
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,280
I'll just do normal.

851
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,260
Look at that.

852
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,360
Look at that, everybody.

853
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,680
What's it called?

854
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,500
I couldn't remember.

855
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,900
The safety loop.

856
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,980
Wait, what's it called again?

857
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,000
One arm.

858
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:29,820
A leg?

859
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:30,720
What is that?

860
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,220
Two arms.

861
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,020
A leg.

862
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,740
Life raft!

863
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,700
Life saver!

864
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,740
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

865
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:41,600
Yeah.

866
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,520
I wouldn't know the name.

867
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,400
I've got no life to save.

868
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,660
Life preserver.

869
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,620
Okay, so what I'm gonna do...

870
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:58,140
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna re-roll and hope for a skull.

871
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,620
And if we get to school...

872
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,820
I can just leave, right?

873
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,820
Charming top left is so good.

874
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,480
Earn one ticket for every three you own.

875
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,820
I own none.

876
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,420
Media Exodia.

877
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,300
Disc B!

878
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,160
I love Disc B.

879
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,400
Disc B is the best because it has this plus seven lock.

880
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,500
I've gotten...

881
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,900
I've gotten many a jackpot with this baby.

882
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:29,500
Amazing early.

883
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,180
Yes, it really is.

884
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,700
Just wait and then re-roll.

885
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,120
Okay, okay.

886
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,260
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.

887
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:36,380
One!

888
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,920
We got this skewer!

889
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,010
Okay, here we go.

890
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:52,410
One.

891
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,870
Does it make a little man?

892
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:57,830
Two.

893
01:01:58,810 --> 01:01:59,990
I'm so excited.

894
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:01,890
Oh!

895
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,330
Four!

896
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,060
This is going to be fun.

897
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,800
It's red.

898
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,400
That's your final reward.

899
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,340
I still haven't decided...

900
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,560
Wait, what do you mean?

901
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:21,900
No, play!

902
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,000
Wait!

903
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,240
Oh no!

904
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:32,640
Wait, so I have to make the...

905
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,120
Oh no.

906
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,600
I still have to play.

907
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,340
I have to make the minimum.

908
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,400
We're so burned.

909
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,760
You still need 250k.

910
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:45,620
Whoa!

911
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,760
Okay, guys.

912
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,560
I believe in us.

913
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,320
I believe, I believe, I believe.

914
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,600
Let's go get the way.

915
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,860
I believe.

916
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,420
Look at

917
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:07,680
this.

918
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,660
We're hitting every...

919
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,380
Every time.

920
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,340
Every time!

921
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,680
Sure, it's just once.

922
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,760
Sometimes not at all.

923
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,740
Do you think they were gonna give you the key?

924
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,060
Yeah.

925
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,220
Yeah, I thought they were just gonna be like, Oh, you collected them all.

926
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,320
Here you go.

927
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:34,700
I thought...

928
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:34,840
Oh.

929
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,180
My machine is so dirty.

930
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:43,920
Whoa!

931
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,800
You should not become a professional gambler.

932
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:54,020
I can count cards on my fingers.

933
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,900
Never give up gambling.

934
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,480
I can count!

935
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,120
Three measly coins.

936
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:12,400
Yeah, one round.

937
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:12,840
I get it.

938
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:26,300
got it now 25% that is insane oh my god oh my god oh my god maybe I should have waited

939
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:42,420
maybe I should have waited because it's pretty easy to to get it's fine you

940
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,800
have to pick it up.

941
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,600
No, I mean the skull.

942
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:54,560
Like, I could have gotten all the other ones, and then get the skull last.

943
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,840
Cherry, cherry, cherry.

944
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,340
Alright.

945
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,640
Wait, is this enough?

946
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,040
Was that the last round?

947
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,680
Okay, good.

948
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,460
Imagine dying on Deadline 1.

949
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,940
Couldn't be me!

950
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,320
Um...

951
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,560
Hmm...

952
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,360
I'm wondering if I should pick up one of these.

953
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,820
I'm thinking maybe the...

954
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,860
the P... the P bottle.

955
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,460
And then hoping for...

956
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,260
Maybe like a fruit basket.

957
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,460
And then...

958
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,400
D4 is better long term.

959
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,020
But D4 like...

960
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,340
I think...

961
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:02,960
What?

962
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:05,300
What is... What are you guys saying?

963
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,960
T4 is more sanitary.

964
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,340
What it, like, doesn't always work.

965
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,680
Pre-charms and drawers at next deadline because of the corpse parts.

966
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,560
Oh, wait, really?

967
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,000
Wait, I didn't know that.

968
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:42,120
I need to have a big percentage number for a certain symbol for the for the P. That's true.

969
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,660
Okay, we'll go with the D4.

970
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,740
Or I could wait and see what shows up in my drawer.

971
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,080
Well, I'll go for D4.

972
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,360
I'm going to have like one coin left.

973
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:58,640
Two.

974
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,560
Two coins!

975
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:03,740
Oh,

976
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:15,900
I should have.

977
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:17,960
Oh, I should have.

978
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,980
Oh, hi-oh.

979
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,420
Oh, hi-oh.

980
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:22,220
Oh, hi-oh.

981
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:26,580
Oh, hi-oh.

982
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:32,660
I could do the thing where I don't.

983
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,520
Let's see what else we got.

984
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:41,680
Red pepper!

985
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,440
Horseshoe!

986
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,480
The clover pot!

987
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,420
Peppa, Peppa.

988
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:56,620
I could have double Peppa.

989
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,960
Wait, I can't have double Peppa.

990
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:58,740
I have no money.

991
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,560
Perfect to pair with a D4.

992
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,060
Yeah.

993
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,160
Yeah.

994
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,640
Horseshoe and D4 are fantastic together.

995
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:08,040
Yeah.

996
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,900
I don't think I want disc C.

997
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,380
I think I'm gonna get rid of it.

998
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:12,520
It scares me.

999
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,740
What if I have a jackpot and it gets completely ruined?

1000
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,200
I think I'll throw it away.

1001
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:23,560
It scares me.

1002
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,970
I have a question for the phone ending.

1003
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:35,070
Will that overwrite the ending I'm currently trying to do?

1004
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,900
Got my money.

1005
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:46,940
Thank you.

1006
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,480
You should get the normal ending first.

1007
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,680
White options.

1008
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,000
Not red for good ending.

1009
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,840
So the ones that add like the devious.

1010
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,440
The...

1011
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:10,280
Okay.

1012
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:11,820
We'll ignore...

1013
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:16,160
Since we are already at something that I've never tried before, we'll just ignore the phone.

1014
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:17,260
Or rather...

1015
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:17,480
No.

1016
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,420
I will keep getting options from the phone.

1017
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:24,320
But I will, you know, I'll just ignore the phone ending for now.

1018
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,360
You might die before the ending without the phone.

1019
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,280
So...

1020
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,360
Okay, hold on.

1021
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,440
What do we have here?

1022
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,570
I want the other pepper.

1023
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,270
Oh, wait.

1024
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,050
This is the one with the cherries.

1025
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:46,470
Have...

1026
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:47,530
Oh, sorry.

1027
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,310
Oh, you guys, I forgot to tell you.

1028
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:52,110
Not hot dog!

1029
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,270
No, this is serious!

1030
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:58,890
My cat started cleaning himself, and then the other cat came and started cleaning him too.

1031
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:01,070
You've done an amazing job, thank you.

1032
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:03,470
That's so cute.

1033
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,350
I love when my cats clean each other.

1034
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:11,450
But I think they both are on, like, a power trip, so they don't want to clean each other, you know?

1035
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:16,010
Because he's just like, I'm not going to be the one getting licked.

1036
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:19,250
I'm going to do the licking.

1037
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:20,290
I'm going to dominate you.

1038
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:51,050
but um i'm on a time limit a little bit i realized i wanted to there was a place i need to go to tonight and i thought they closed at nine and they closed at eight so i i have three hours so probably i don't know how long today will be i know it's so early i was like why is it so early.

1039
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,490
Freaky cats, just like their owner.

1040
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:55,710
I think that's normal cat behavior.

1041
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:58,050
God, I beat the push recently on Halloween.

1042
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:00,050
Oh my gosh, they're bad.

1043
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:00,770
Thank you.

1044
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:01,710
I moved.

1045
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,510
I'm glad you still got it then.

1046
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:06,270
Oh my gosh.

1047
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:12,690
Yeah, I don't want to be the customer that shows up five minutes to close, but I don't have a lot that I need to get.

1048
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:13,890
Wait.

1049
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:14,830
What was I doing?

1050
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:15,550
Okay.

1051
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:21,850
Honestly, I don't like all three.

1052
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:22,450
of these.

1053
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:26,170
They're kind of tough to work with right now.

1054
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:28,370
I'm gonna hold off for a second.

1055
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:33,670
ATM money.

1056
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:34,890
Wait, did I not?

1057
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,010
Wait, what do you mean?

1058
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:38,050
Get ATM money?

1059
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:38,870
I already did.

1060
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,530
Oh, hey!

1061
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:47,090
Oh!

1062
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:50,850
Tch!

1063
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:04,210
Ah!

1064
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,730
I almost want to get the green pepper.

1065
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:11,250
I feel like luck, we need the luck on our side right now, you know?

1066
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:18,550
Bell's phone and iron trust.

1067
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:19,830
Oh, true!

1068
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,310
Oh my gosh, wait, I forgot!

1069
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:23,270
I can't hold it.

1070
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,570
Actually, I think that's a good idea.

1071
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:30,070
Or...

1072
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:32,930
It's hard.

1073
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,010
It's tough.

1074
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:55,850
one is how much luck plus five i think because we have the horseshoe honestly getting the other peppered like if we get double peppers if we just keep getting jackpots then it'll be okay maybe you know what i mean so bells

1075
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:05,990
and iron is better because you can still buy the pepper next round wait why how will i be able to buy the pepper next round

1076
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:15,560
re-roll jackpots just roll Or roll jackpots, yeah.

1077
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,000
Just get more jackpots!

1078
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:17,540
Forehead?

1079
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,460
You'll get tickets from the iron.

1080
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,420
Yeah, but if it's not in the thing, then I will...

1081
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,220
Oh, I get what you mean!

1082
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:30,200
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1083
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,360
So if I did bell...

1084
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:35,720
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

1085
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:36,560
I get the...

1086
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:41,060
I hopefully get bells to get tickets to buy the green pepper.

1087
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1088
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,660
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1089
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,120
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1090
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:49,520
I understand.

1091
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,860
We only have...

1092
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,340
We have two rounds.

1093
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,460
Double pepper.

1094
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:58,820
Double pepper, double pepper.

1095
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,400
Okay!

1096
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,380
Eight.

1097
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,800
How much do I need?

1098
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:12,240
Oh.

1099
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:16,260
Guys...

1100
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,860
I'm not sure.

1101
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,360
We got many...

1102
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,280
many tickets.

1103
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,480
Double pepper, double pepper.

1104
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:34,740
Beep, beep.

1105
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,840
That wasn't so great.

1106
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:37,860
But maybe.

1107
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:39,980
Just maybe.

1108
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,560
Maybe.

1109
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,560
Maybe!

1110
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1111
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,380
One pepper.

1112
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,820
Oh, come on!

1113
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:17,320
So many tickets!

1114
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:18,100
Wow!

1115
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:25,760
Oh, guys, it wasn't a jackpot!

1116
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,270
There's no way.

1117
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,540
Let's go back on the ground.

1118
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:07,380
Wee!

1119
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:07,880
Wee!

1120
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:08,840
Wee!

1121
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:09,220
Wee!

1122
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:10,360
Wee!

1123
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:10,600
Wee!

1124
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:30,270
This is okay.

1125
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:34,070
Z4 Shine.

1126
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:35,010
Thank you so much for the...

1127
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:35,550
Thank you!

1128
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:37,650
Thank you!

1129
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,890
Guys, when will the streamer look?

1130
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:43,390
When will it hit?

1131
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:52,770
Okay, here we go.

1132
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,010
We're equipping them.

1133
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:56,010
We're equipping them.

1134
01:16:57,590 --> 01:17:00,070
I'm gonna do the same thing as before where...

1135
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:01,730
I might buy the bricks.

1136
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:37,330
Logs and hamsa These are bricks, not logs On everyone's soul This is the run Guys, I gotta get out I gotta get out of here I gotta get out of here This run trust I wanna get the bricks And then I wanna re-roll for the skull But Do I need a full set to get the full to get full drawers

1137
01:17:41,650 --> 01:18:04,830
multitasking were those the anguish cries of victory absolutely whenever I win something I go God no God why did this happen to me why me why why did this terrible thing in my afterlife why of all people why did it choose me I said that every time I win Hot dog.

1138
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:06,210
Hot dog indeed.

1139
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:09,570
Minto of great luck.

1140
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:12,510
Please bestow me your blessings.

1141
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:22,170
You will find a quarter on the street face up.

1142
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,050
And it will bring you great luck.

1143
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:29,450
Comment.

1144
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,630
I found a quarter for good luck.

1145
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:33,410
I'm so glad.

1146
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:36,670
I found a quarter.

1147
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:40,310
Maybe I should, though.

1148
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:46,210
I always feel like having the modifier for the interest is good is extra money.

1149
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:52,950
But we'll get a pepper.

1150
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:57,470
Lucky Charms at the store costs one less.

1151
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:58,870
I like that.

1152
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:00,590
I found a quarter.

1153
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:01,650
I found a quarter.

1154
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:03,770
Wait, I could...

1155
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:04,010
Well...

1156
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,170
How much is it?

1157
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:05,950
Seven, right?

1158
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:07,690
Yeah.

1159
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,800
Let's go gambling!

1160
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:17,120
Hoi!

1161
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:22,450
No!

1162
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:31,620
Yippee!

1163
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:34,400
No!

1164
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:37,760
Guys, this game hates me.

1165
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:41,920
I think this game hates me for real.

1166
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,620
Aw, dang it.

1167
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,000
Aw, dang it, real.

1168
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:46,960
Aw, dang it, moment.

1169
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,880
Aw, dang it.

1170
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:49,940
I

1171
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,160
wish it were.

1172
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:00,140
Wait, if everything costs one less, then things that are one should be free, no?

1173
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:04,700
Right?

1174
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:06,780
Yeah.

1175
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,660
Oh, the honeymoon phase is over.

1176
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,780
I almost want to restock one more time.

1177
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,020
See if we can get this skull.

1178
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:23,050
Okay, hold on.

1179
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:28,110
I get the pepper.

1180
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,970
I restock.

1181
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:37,430
Clicker.

1182
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:38,910
I won't be able to get it, though.

1183
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,070
Sucks.

1184
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:43,590
Well, I tried.

1185
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:54,810
This is the run.

1186
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:55,510
You think so?

1187
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:57,950
Don't jinx me now.

1188
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,210
I'm counting on you all.

1189
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:03,770
Beep-deep.

1190
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:08,920
No.

1191
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,500
Yeah, say no.

1192
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,560
I know, I know.

1193
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:19,340
Don't scare me like that.

1194
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,100
I'm trying to decide if I want the extra tickets or not.

1195
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,220
What do you guys think?

1196
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:42,980
Extra tickets?

1197
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,300
Four more tickets?

1198
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:47,640
Yeah, four tickets?

1199
01:21:49,220 --> 01:22:23,740
get the I usually like do the deadline bonus in the beginnings because it's good to like catch you up you know 240 what we got here okay oh oh the professional not professional the personal trainer let's see let's see Let's see...

1200
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,160
3% of my interest.

1201
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,900
If we're...

1202
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:33,000
Because I have the modifier, it might be good to go with interest.

1203
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,760
You don't have to get all the limbs at the very beginning.

1204
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,940
You can keep them in the drawers until the end of the deadline.

1205
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,660
So you do your spin, see how good you're doing, and get some limbs.

1206
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:47,800
I guess that's true.

1207
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,560
I'll get the rest later from 666s.

1208
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:50,960
Yeah, that's true.

1209
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,440
true oh

1210
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:22,070
yes yes thank you put my pepper away first before because if it gives it to the pepper thank you that's funny how it's like this one has to do with my interest and it has extra interest on it yes yes yes i think also the stain would be well i don't really get like four plus symbols During a spin right now?

1211
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:28,630
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1212
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,540
That's a coward move.

1213
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,600
But yeah, if you get a 666, you do, if your drawer...

1214
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,800
I don't, actually, I don't...

1215
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,020
I think it's only if your drawers are empty, you'll get an extra limb.

1216
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:56,060
I would know, I've gotten many a 666.

1217
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:58,520
This pepper?

1218
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:06,320
But it's whenever three plus patterns triggered during a spin, increase the bonus by three.

1219
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,920
So it would be luck plus three.

1220
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,540
Yeah, interest is very weak early game, it's true.

1221
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,360
I've never tried the rotten pepper.

1222
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,480
I'll try it.

1223
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:32,140
I also kind of want to get the personal trainer, but I feel like it won't be so good.

1224
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:39,240
we're at right now you know and it sucks that he has to be discarded later unless well

1225
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,540
okay we have the personal trainer right

1226
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:10,200
oh whoa guys imagine if this were a jackpot it would have been crazy Oh my god, it would have been a mega!

1227
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:16,350
What?

1228
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,890
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1229
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,550
Wowee!

1230
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:24,350
When life gives you lemons!

1231
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:28,630
I know what happens to me all the time.

1232
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:29,730
It's so frustrating.

1233
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:36,760
Yippee!

1234
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,520
Nice.

1235
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:45,380
Maybe?

1236
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:46,480
No.

1237
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,360
Lame, so lame, so lame.

1238
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:51,640
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1239
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:54,640
What that?

1240
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,860
Look at that, we have two rounds left.

1241
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,060
And we're swimming in cash.

1242
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,220
Maybe it was worth it.

1243
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,720
Should we try for the skull?

1244
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:17,110
Wee!

1245
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,330
I got it.

1246
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:24,770
are putting some effort into it.

1247
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:26,670
I have to recognize that.

1248
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:29,870
But how much more?

1249
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:31,130
Oh, it didn't go up anymore.

1250
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,970
Or guess it did.

1251
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:35,710
Yes, it did.

1252
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:37,130
Yeah.

1253
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,610
I'm gonna keep rolling.

1254
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:43,370
Maybe I will do one.

1255
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:45,150
We'll see where we're at.

1256
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:47,350
I like to be a little comfortable, you know.

1257
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,830
Yeah, I did a wee bit.

1258

Oh!

1266
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,560
Aussie man, happy early birthday!

1267
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,460
Break the machine!

1268
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:18,740
Break the machine!

1269
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:21,720
Yippee!

1270
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:30,660
What'd we get?

1271
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,360
What'd we get?

1272
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:37,140
Oh, I should have done the card where we get the free... where we get the extra roll.

1273
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,120
He's gonna get mad at me.

1274
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,200
He's gonna be like, Things are going too well.

1275
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,360
I'm gonna...

1276
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:50,620
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

1277
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:51,600
Do it.

1278
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,640
I'm gonna...

1279
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,920
I'm gonna make it so that you'll lose all your money, idiot.

1280
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,440
That's a spicy jackpot.

1281
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:07,370
What is this?

1282
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:08,450
Ritual bell.

1283
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:09,270
Oh.

1284
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:13,450
Wait, how many...

1285
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:15,310
Okay, I have two slots that I can choose.

1286
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:19,290
Okay, this one's not bad.

1287
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:21,230
Maybe.

1288
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:23,790
Sometimes this one has also screwed me over before, though.

1289
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:28,190
Okay.

1290
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:29,790
Let's see.

1291
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:33,570
I definitely want to get the...

1292
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:35,330
The capitalist.

1293
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:37,010
The raging capitalist.

1294
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:42,050
Could toss the stone.

1295
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:42,350
Yeah?

1296
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:43,970
We could toss this.

1297
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:47,450
Actually...

1298
01:30:47,450 --> 01:30:49,490
Oh, this one's...

1299
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:52,550
Is there any of them?

1300
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:55,690
Okay, this one will equip, obviously.

1301
01:30:56,730 --> 01:30:57,790
We'll sell this one.

1302
01:30:58,890 --> 01:30:59,890
We'll sell the star.

1303
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:03,590
We'll get this one.

1304
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:06,730
And then I guess we could get him.

1305
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:12,470
Pip-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup.

1306
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:13,690
Let's see.

1307
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:15,710
Double your clover tickets, set your...

1308
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:16,870
No, no, no, no, no.

1309
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:20,510
What do I have currently?

1310
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:21,970
That's like...

1311
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:26,490
I guess we want more lemons, technically, is the only thing I've got going on.

1312
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:31,930
We're cooking?

1313
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:33,970
I have to decide this too.

1314
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:40,470
Wait, I need 800 though.

1315
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:43,130
I'll be left with...

1316
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:52,730
I'll be left with, like, 200-ish or something?

1317
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:55,350
Don't skip?

1318
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:56,010
You think so?

1319
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:03,130
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1320
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:03,890
Ah!

1321
01:32:05,090 --> 01:32:06,710
Oh, I can't get out of it!

1322
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,720
If I say no, then I lose the chance of...

1323
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,480
I guess I don't need the memory pack.

1324
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:23,380
Okay, dang it.

1325
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:27,700
Dang, dang it.

1326
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:28,240
Well, it's okay.

1327
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,040
Yeah, I just say no.

1328
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:33,700
I think it's probably more difficult if you start skipping, though.

1329
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:35,060
Okay, let's see.

1330
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,240
Yeah, we're trying to leave.

1331
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:52,800
I really just have to decide which ones I want to get rid of, like, the diamonds, treasure sevens, or the clovers and bells.

1332
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,830
Not sure which boosts lemons more.

1333
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:10,590
If this one decreases the chances of three, so technically maybe it would boost 11s more.

1334
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:16,910
But then these ones are more common, you know.

1335
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:19,590
They're percentages.

1336
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:26,070
Here, let me start the deposit my money before I forget.

1337
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:33,450
But bells and clovers are more frequent.

1338
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:34,150
That's true.

1339
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:34,770
Exactly.

1340
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:38,110
So probably either one works.

1341
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:42,670
I'm gonna go for this one because...

1342
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:46,890
I'm gonna go for the middle one because sometimes you can get some really good items for like clovers and bells.

1343
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:54,940
So...

1344
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:55,360
Okay.

1345
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:57,100
Let's go gambling!

1346
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:57,500
What?

1347
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:01,640
Whoa!

1348
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,020
There were like...

1349
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:08,160
More bells?

1350
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:08,900
Okay.

1351
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:10,900
You'll get more bells!

1352
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:11,760
Whoa!

1353
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,080
Crazy first pull.

1354
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,940
More bells, they said.

1355
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:25,280
Good start, for real.

1356
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:27,200
Uh-oh.

1357
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:40,120
Yeah!

1358
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:49,070
Jackpot!

1359
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:04,010
You gotta risk it all to gain it all!

1360
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:04,330
Whoa!

1361
01:35:05,290 --> 01:35:05,570
Yeah!

1362
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:12,100
Me!

1363
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,820
Let's go.

1364
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,780
Always gamble.

1365
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,180
Always gamble!

1366
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:24,660
He's gonna get mad at me.

1367
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,060
He's gonna say, you have too much money!

1368
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:30,020
23 tickets!

1369
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,240
Oh, close.

1370
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:40,730
Wisps always right.

1371
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:45,690
Wait, wisps always quit before, right before they hit me.

1372
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,710
I was just saying you guys are always right.

1373
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:51,230
Jackpot!

1374
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:56,250
Yippee!

1375
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:59,810
Give me them sweet, sweet tickets.

1376
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:03,370
Oh, he's really gonna get mad at me.

1377
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:04,750
He's gonna get so mad at me.

1378
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:06,230
He's gonna get mad at me.

1379
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:10,810
At least I don't lose the tickets.

1380
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:12,250
Gosh.

1381
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,340
This is like...

1382
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,720
A completely vanilla jackpot!

1383
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,100
Nothing special about it.

1384
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,260
Oh, he's gonna hate me.

1385
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,160
He's gonna say, things are going too well.

1386
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:33,380
No!

1387
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:34,460
My trainer!

1388
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,420
He's gonna...

1389
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:39,660
Oh.

1390
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:41,920
I'm gonna get this one.

1391
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:43,320
We'll get the three.

1392
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,500
free restocks.

1393
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:45,680
Why not?

1394
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,820
Or rather...

1395
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,880
Oh yeah, I forgot every time I buy something.

1396
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:02,240
I'll...

1397
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,760
I still have one round left.

1398
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:08,040
But...

1399
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,560
Oh, the triggers randomly.

1400
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:12,920
This one?

1401
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,100
We can get the clover pot.

1402
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:17,360
Okay.

1403
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:19,880
This one is also extra luck.

1404
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:23,420
Empty your drawers.

1405
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,240
Oh, true, true.

1406
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:24,720
Thank you.

1407
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:26,240
I don't think I wore...

1408
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,240
This one.

1409
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:28,200
I think I'm okay.

1410
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:28,860
We'll throw it away.

1411
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,580
I don't think it's really conducive for what I've got going on.

1412
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:33,560
And this one, as well.

1413
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:34,060
Throw away.

1414
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,680
The horse shield.

1415
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,540
I think the horse shield would be good.

1416
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:50,520
Thank you.

1417
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:56,390
Cloverpot and horseshoe together.

1418
01:37:57,930 --> 01:37:58,450
Let's see.

1419
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:01,970
This one only has two left.

1420
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:03,690
Oh, I keep forgetting that one goes away.

1421
01:38:04,190 --> 01:38:06,710
This one only has two left, so...

1422
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,870
Wait, what about my purse, too?

1423
01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:10,790
9%.

1424
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:11,090
Okay.

1425
01:38:12,910 --> 01:38:15,550
Yeah, the horseshoe will trigger the peppers more often.

1426
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:18,870
I do want the Cloverpot.

1427
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:21,470
Because it will be crazy.

1428
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:26,750
How many tickets we will be able to get, but...

1429
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:31,210
I still have time.

1430
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:34,970
Let's go gambling!

1431
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:46,130
We might even lose one of the peppers this round if it like, you know, activates twice for whatever reason.

1432
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:48,170
Oh no!

1433
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:49,010
Ah!

1434
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:52,870
See?

1435
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:55,310
I told you, I told you.

1436
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:04,590
That was close.

1437
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:05,790
That was scary.

1438
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:08,690
Jackpot!

1439
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:11,450
Jackpot!

1440
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:19,610
Yippee!

1441
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:27,810
Jackpot!

1442
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:32,010
Yippee!

1443
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:33,870
Another vanilla jackpot.

1444
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:37,770
It's kind of depressing, honestly, seeing the total you get when you're just like, oh.

1445
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:39,310
That's it.

1446
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:44,170
Okay, okay.

1447
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:50,210
A couple weeks ago, I went to a casino for the first time I saw how fancy slot machines have gotten.

1448
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:52,990
I remember thinking, whoa, this is just like Cloverpit.

1449
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:56,510
He's gonna get mad at me.

1450
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:58,250
He's gonna get mad at me.

1451
01:39:59,830 --> 01:40:00,670
Holy cow.

1452
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:02,610
Holy cow.

1453
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:06,270
Don't get mad at me, please!

1454
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:08,170
Please, uh, please!

1455
01:40:08,590 --> 01:40:09,110
What do we get?

1456
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:11,570
We got a golden diamond.

1457
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:15,570
We've got the naughty dealer!

1458
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:20,110
Wait, if I get this guy...

1459
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:22,990
I could get rid of...

1460
01:40:22,990 --> 01:40:24,110
Well, but our interest...

1461
01:40:28,510 --> 01:40:29,630
More bells!

1462
01:40:29,950 --> 01:40:30,810
More bells!

1463
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:36,290
Wait, what did I...

1464
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:39,170
Wait, did I go for bells more before?

1465
01:40:41,690 --> 01:40:42,890
Ew, Necronobicon.

1466
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:45,570
Pattern multiplier boost 2.

1467
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:48,470
Ew, it's twitching like that.

1468
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:50,770
And more pepper.

1469
01:40:52,810 --> 01:40:54,450
Oh, that was the previous run.

1470
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:56,490
Okay, okay.

1471
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:59,050
Oh, yeah.

1472
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:03,890
Take the cross charm first.

1473
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:05,210
This one?

1474
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:06,610
Oh, that's wrong.

1475
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:09,290
Whenever you pick a phone ability, ban it.

1476
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:12,670
When you discard, unban it and trigger it again.

1477
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:16,790
So we could get it.

1478
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:19,670
I'd have to get rid of something.

1479
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:20,850
Get rid of you.

1480
01:41:20,990 --> 01:41:21,310
Throw away.

1481
01:41:23,730 --> 01:41:25,210
I'd have to get rid of two things, actually.

1482
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:26,990
Throw away.

1483
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:30,030
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1484
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:31,590
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1485
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:32,150
So.

1486
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:35,050
I want you.

1487
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:38,790
I need you.

1488
01:41:40,370 --> 01:41:42,230
I love you.

1489
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:48,810
And then I could do more bells.

1490
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:50,950
Are we going for a bells run?

1491
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:55,770
I guess it doesn't really matter what we go for.

1492
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:00,590
Heavy rotation.

1493
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,670
Re-roll the phone.

1494
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:11,170
You think so?

1495
01:42:11,190 --> 01:42:12,350
So why, though?

1496
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:14,030
How much longer did the peppers last?

1497
01:42:14,510 --> 01:42:15,910
This guy lasts three.

1498
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:19,170
You're always such a killer!

1499
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:23,150
I'm a killer now!

1500
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:31,290
You can actually stick the clover in the drawer until deadline.

1501
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:32,050
That's true!

1502
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:33,410
Actually, we don't need it.

1503
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:36,010
That's so true.

1504
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:36,870
Put it in the drawer.

1505
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:38,990
That is very true.

1506
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:41,090
Okay, equip you.

1507
01:42:47,850 --> 01:43:13,170
stop beeping at me I don't know hold on I'm trying to think everything's beeping at me get this I will I will I'm just I think I will go for bells honestly I think it doesn't matter well I mean it does matter we need like we need like charms that affect the thing that we're aiming to be our highest symbol is what I'm trying to say but

1508
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:20,130
oh But...

1509
01:43:20,130 --> 01:43:21,350
Bells get a lot of good charms.

1510
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:23,970
Yeah, it's just a matter of me pulling them is the thing.

1511
01:43:25,130 --> 01:43:26,850
So what I'm gonna do...

1512
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:28,250
Wait, I do have to put you away.

1513
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:28,930
I'm so sorry.

1514
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:31,350
Put in the drawer.

1515
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:32,470
Put you away.

1516
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:35,830
Alright, whenever you pick a phone ability, ban it.

1517
01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:39,210
When you discard, unban it.

1518
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:42,710
So basically, I would buy this.

1519
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:46,670
Activate the bells, then sell this.

1520
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:47,170
Right?

1521
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:51,710
the order of operations.

1522
01:43:55,410 --> 01:43:59,370
Oh, look, see, this is also a symbol multiplier for every five.

1523
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:03,210
Yes, okay, okay.

1524
01:44:07,030 --> 01:44:07,990
Manifest bells.

1525
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:13,730
Clover pet is so good, too?

1526
01:44:13,950 --> 01:44:14,190
Yeah.

1527
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:16,290
I mean, I have...

1528
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:18,250
Okay, so now, sorry, I sell you.

1529
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:22,670
It's kind of intense.

1530
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:27,150
Clover Pet is great with Capitalist.

1531
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:30,950
I have to get rid of some stuff, though.

1532
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:33,530
I still will buy it.

1533
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,130
I still will buy it.

1534
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:39,870
Because also, yeah, we'll use him, and we get more charms, and...

1535
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:40,490
Wait, what are we at?

1536
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:43,870
We're at 8% chance.

1537
01:44:43,990 --> 01:44:46,010
Okay, we need to buy, buy, buy, baby.

1538
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:47,490
The purse?

1539
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:49,210
It's not sick.

1540
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:50,510
6%.

1541
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:53,090
Yeah, I won't go for much longer.

1542
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:54,070
I'll throw it away.

1543
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:55,950
I'll throw it away.

1544
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:56,330
Goodbye!

1545
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:02,490
I'm gonna hold on to the bricks just for now, for a little bit longer.

1546
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:07,930
Okay.

1547
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:09,010
I'll quit.

1548
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:11,730
Oh yeah, that's right.

1549
01:45:12,130 --> 01:45:13,530
I'm not gonna skip, you guys.

1550
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:14,510
I'm not gonna skip.

1551
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:16,870
I'm not gonna accept.

1552
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:17,190
No.

1553
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:18,530
Okay.

1554
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:20,910
It didn't get mad at me.

1555
01:45:25,030 --> 01:45:25,230
All right.

1556
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:26,370
It didn't get mad at me.

1557
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:31,630
Hopefully we can get a more pattern or more...

1558
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:32,950
More charm slot.

1559
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:39,330
We need golden bells for scaling.

1560
01:45:42,150 --> 01:45:42,590
Yeah.

1561
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:48,430
Okay.

1562
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:51,110
Ah, goodbye pepper.

1563
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:51,970
Goodbye pepper.

1564
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:54,010
It's okay.

1565
01:45:54,010 --> 01:46:05,490
we got another pepper to add now we're going for the bone key oh my gosh so many bells but only one ticket

1566
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:27,560
yippee nice I wish I wish we had like a repeater you know that was the personal trainer wasn't it so lame Okay, so now I can add you.

1567
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:28,140
Equip.

1568
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:30,760
I still have a re-roll.

1569
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:32,360
I mean...

1570
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:35,580
But it's okay.

1571
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:36,680
I still...

1572
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:37,880
Let's just try for now.

1573
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:40,420
Let's go gambling.

1574
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:40,740
Hoi!

1575
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:46,500
I can't put my coins in because it'll end around.

1576
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:49,400
Oh!

1577
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:51,700
Oh, it's okay.

1578
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:52,360
That's right.

1579
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:53,320
I don't have the...

1580
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,460
Flaming 666.

1581
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,760
Yeah, hold off on the re-roll as long as possible.

1582
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:05,900
Because we have the other pepper, we want to hold off.

1583
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:08,820
We want to always be...

1584
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:17,520
We don't want to skip so many deadlines because we got this guy who accumulates luck throughout it.

1585
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:18,620
So...

1586
01:47:18,620 --> 01:47:21,820
There are deadlines skippable, right?

1587
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:25,380
Howie!

1588
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,320
Guys,

1589
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:41,900
this might actually...

1590
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:43,000
This might...

1591
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,860
Oh, might be the run.

1592
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,720
I don't want to jinx it, though.

1593
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:47,960
I think I just jinxed it.

1594
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:53,960
I think I just jinxed it, but that's okay.

1595
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:55,100
We're fine.

1596
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,090
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

1597
01:48:05,350 --> 01:48:06,610
Let's go, gambling.

1598
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:14,610
Come on.

1599
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:16,450
Yeah, baby.

1600
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:19,230
More tickets.

1601
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:22,910
What is this one, right?

1602
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:25,670
The more tickets we have, the more symbol multiplier.

1603
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:28,750
I just gotta be hoarding tickets, I guess.

1604
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:32,450
Oh!

1605
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:34,250
Oh!

1606
01:48:36,530 --> 01:48:38,570
That's music to my ears.

1611
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:58,940
This does trigger randomly.

1612
01:49:59,160 --> 01:49:59,600
I'm a liar.

1613
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:00,820
I'm an absolute liar.

1614
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:02,460
We will re-equip this, though.

1615
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:03,680
Oh, wait.

1616
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,020
Oh, I lost... I forgot.

1617
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:05,520
Wait a second.

1618
01:50:06,740 --> 01:50:07,840
I forgot I lost something.

1619
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:08,360
Never mind.

1620
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:10,400
Just kidding.

1621
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:11,400
I forgot the pepper.

1622
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,560
Yeah, we do need it.

1623
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,340
We do need it.

1624
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,380
I'm a liar.

1625
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:18,980
I'm a big ol' liar.

1626
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:22,580
Okay, he's not mad at me.

1627
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:23,600
He's not mad at me.

1628
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,040
What have we got?

1629
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,720
Clover Field!

1630
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:30,600
Uh, we're okay with it.

1631
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:35,100
Bar-barath-barath-barath-barath-rum.

1632
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,620
Bar-barathrum.

1633
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:42,580
We got it back!

1634
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,400
Wait, what do we have?

1635
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:49,060
Let's- Huge!

1636
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:50,580
Huge, huge, huge!

1637
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:52,400
Wait!

1638
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:55,320
Wait, so we can get two!

1639
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:56,880
Oh my god, wait!

1640
01:50:57,460 --> 01:50:59,500
Yo, wait, that's huge!

1641
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:01,620
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of this.

1642
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,260
Oh my gosh.

1643
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:07,220
Oh my gosh.

1644
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,020
I think I can get rid of that.

1645
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,200
I think I could get rid of all three of these, honestly.

1646
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:21,930
Fish for megaphone?

1647
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:23,370
What does a megaphone do?

1648
01:51:24,390 --> 01:51:26,030
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of all three of these.

1649
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:28,310
Because we have nothing with a button anyway.

1650
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:35,860
Okay.

1651
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,700
And then put you away.

1652
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:42,640
Grab you.

1653
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:43,260
Equip.

1654
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:44,960
Grab you.

1655
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:46,040
Increase.

1656
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:47,600
Thank you.

1657
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,360
And then.

1658
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:53,380
Throw away.

1659
01:51:58,240 --> 01:51:58,520
Whoa!

1660
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:01,360
Wait, what do you mean, though?

1661
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:02,500
Hmm?

1662
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:05,440
What?

1663
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,740
What do you mean, though?

1664
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,760
That's what we said we were gonna do.

1665
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:11,300
Huh?

1666
01:52:17,460 --> 01:52:18,080
Wait, I'm confused.

1667
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:23,540
They say megaphone- oh, was megaphone- wait.

1668
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:27,880
Oh, was megaphone one of the charm things?

1669
01:52:30,780 --> 01:52:33,800
Megaphone is for before you choose phones- wait what?

1670
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:37,240
Huh?

1671
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:41,990
Oh my god, shut up!

1672
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:48,380
You're good?

1673
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,200
It's okay?

1674
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:51,880
Megaphone is rare, so it's fine.

1675
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:56,680
Oh, oh, Megaphone also double- Oh, that's- oh, I got what you guys mean.

1676
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,060
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1677
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:02,220
Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.

1678
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:05,480
Oh, I think it's okay though.

1679
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:08,440
That would have been like...

1680
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:09,320
I think it's okay still.

1681
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:13,540
I think it's okay.

1682
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:15,240
If I die, whatever.

1683
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:16,920
It's just a game.

1684
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,060
okay.

1685
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:28,680
I don't think I need the batteries because I have nothing that is for...

1686
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:30,060
Okay, equip you again.

1687
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:34,080
Plus 7 lock.

1688
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:39,320
I just wanted extra gamba.

1689
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:40,140
It's okay.

1690
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:40,520
Watch.

1691
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,260
Imagine if I reroll and I had the megaphone.

1692
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,120
You guys might actually strangle me.

1693
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:48,780
Hmm.

1694
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,000
No, dear!

1695
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,160
Okay, good.

1696
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:57,790
It feels good finally depositing my money.

1697
01:54:00,510 --> 01:54:01,430
Okay, okay.

1698
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:03,810
Seven.

1699
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,830
I'm gonna...

1700
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:07,330
Wait!

1701
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:08,390
The bell ticket.

1702
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:09,630
To have the ticket.

1703
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:10,230
Bell.

1704
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:12,890
Wait, the bell is to have a ticket modifier.

1705
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:14,670
Do I need that, though?

1706
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:21,680
Do I grab it?

1707
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:28,740
Do I watch this?

1708
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:29,460
Yeah.

1709
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,680
Yeah, I do have space.

1710
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:34,080
I think I might grab this.

1711
01:54:35,060 --> 01:54:37,000
And I can...

1712
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,760
I want to re-roll, but...

1713
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:40,880
I just did it anyway.

1714
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:41,960
I did whatever I want.

1715
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:43,420
Oh!

1716
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:45,380
More bells!

1717
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:46,540
More bells!

1718
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:49,780
What do I want to get rid of?

1719
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:59,640
Sell the disc.

1720
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:00,560
Yeah.

1721
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:03,940
Oh, drawer, clover.

1722
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:04,600
So true.

1723
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:05,500
Thank you.

1724
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:06,840
Yeah, put in drawer.

1725
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:07,960
Yes.

1726
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:09,660
Okay.

1727
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:12,240
Okay, we're good for now.

1728
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:14,120
Let's go, gambling.

1729
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:15,140
Hoi!

1730
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:21,620
Holy moly!

1731
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:31,760
So many bells.

1732
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:35,840
insanity.

1733
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:39,340
Aw.

1734
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:45,220
No.

1735
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,100
Don't do it to me.

1736
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:51,640
Don't do that to me.

1737
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:53,660
We need my...

1738
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,300
We need this luck to go up more.

1739
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:57,460
Only plus six for them.

1740
01:55:59,640 --> 01:55:59,880
Okay.

1741
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,220
So scary!

1742
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:11,740
Oh, whoa!

1743
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:16,340
You bastard!

1744
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:22,260
You stole my jackpot from me!

1745
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:27,980
Damn, freaking me out.

1746
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:31,320
It's freaking me out right now.

1747
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:33,120
Why'd you do that?

1748
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:37,980
Let's go gambling!

1749
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:39,440
Hooray!

1750
01:56:48,170 --> 01:56:48,650
Nois.

1751
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:56,340
Halloween and over.

1752
01:56:57,880 --> 01:56:59,760
We're getting so many tickets.

1753
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:04,520
I love having lots of tickets.

1754
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:08,380
Nois.

1755
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:10,640
Yeah.

1756
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,340
Yeah?

1757
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:16,040
So close.

1758
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:19,300
Close, but not.

1759
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,300
Does she have the book that gives you extra spins after 666?

1760
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:25,900
No, I do not.

1761
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,360
Yeah, there is an item that scales with tickets.

1762
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:30,920
There are.

1763
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:31,860
There's a couple, I think.

1764
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:32,280
Pretty sure.

1765
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:38,500
Oh, no, no, no.

1766
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:39,180
We keep going.

1767
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:39,860
We keep going.

1768
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:43,400
Let's go, gambling.

1769
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:43,880
What?

1770
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:55,370
Yes?

1771
01:57:56,230 --> 01:57:56,910
Yes!

1772
01:57:58,530 --> 01:58:03,770
If only I had the repeater though.

1773
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:16,110
So

1774
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:22,790
many tickets.

1775
01:58:26,570 --> 01:58:29,910
Yeah, we have the bell picture, so...

1776
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:36,310
Getting away, having a way to reset them would be good.

1777
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:39,810
Because that requires the button.

1778
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:43,670
Time to deposit!

1779
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:46,390
Alright guys.

1780
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:49,690
Oh my gosh, we still!

1781
01:58:52,810 --> 01:58:53,110
Oops!

1782
01:58:53,990 --> 01:58:54,390
I forgot.

1783
01:58:56,670 --> 01:58:57,330
I forgot.

1784
01:58:58,390 --> 01:58:58,810
My bad.

1785
01:58:59,210 --> 01:59:02,050
I completely forgot about my clover pot.

1786
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:05,410
I could have gotten an extra 49!

1787
01:59:06,290 --> 01:59:07,910
Oh, well.

1788
01:59:09,630 --> 01:59:10,870
The wallet!

1789
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:17,440
No deal!

1790
01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:29,110
Number two.

1791
01:59:30,490 --> 01:59:31,790
What do we have here?

1792
01:59:33,330 --> 01:59:34,730
Oh, restore all charms!

1793
01:59:35,570 --> 01:59:36,490
Clovers manifest.

1794
01:59:36,650 --> 01:59:39,310
I think we can restore...

1795
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:41,710
the charms.

1796
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:44,290
Well, it's only one left, but...

1797
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:45,990
Yeah, we'll go with wallet.

1798
01:59:46,230 --> 01:59:48,170
And it even gives me more tickets.

1799
01:59:50,090 --> 01:59:51,230
Rewrall the phone.

1800
01:59:53,070 --> 01:59:53,650
Oh, true.

1801
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:54,890
I forgot.

1802
01:59:56,310 --> 02:00:00,470
I forgot that I have so many tickets I can just re-roll easily.

1803
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:06,290
We could do...

1804
02:00:06,290 --> 02:00:07,390
Oh, what's in the drawer?

1805
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:08,070
Good question.

1806
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:09,730
Oh, the clover pot.

1807
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:11,970
We've got pee.

1808
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:14,230
We've got pee.

1809
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,310
We've got Ace of Spades.

1810
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:32,760
I think I might get rid of the disc.

1811
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:36,440
Oh, no way.

1812
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:38,420
I might get rid of the bricks.

1813
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:42,480
Yeah, mostly trash.

1814
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:51,110
The bricks are...

1815
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:52,790
Oh, well, yeah, that's true, I guess.

1816
02:00:52,790 --> 02:00:53,650
It is a lot of money.

1817
02:00:55,310 --> 02:00:56,730
The speculative is big.

1818
02:00:58,610 --> 02:01:00,870
Yeah, I don't know what to get rid of.

1819
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:04,850
Why did we get bricks?

1820
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:06,590
Because it was the beginning of the game.

1821
02:01:08,910 --> 02:01:11,990
It was the beginning of the game, and I needed it.

1822
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:19,100
I think I'll get rid of the record.

1823
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:21,780
Goodbye.

1824
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,060
And then.

1825
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:28,980
The wallet is for sure we need.

1826
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:31,760
Okay.

1827
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:35,660
What is our guy looking at right now?

1828
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:36,400
12%?

1829
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:38,320
Okay.

1830
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:41,160
Re-roll phone for bell chance?

1831
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:41,680
Okay!

1832
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:46,340
Well, doubles the values of clovers and bells.

1833
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:51,760
I could do double jackpot value.

1834
02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:02,800
Does double jackpot even that good?

1835
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:07,920
Double jackpot?

1836
02:02:13,950 --> 02:02:15,770
I do kill a lot of jackpots.

1837
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:16,510
I guess that's true.

1838
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:22,860
It falls off.

1839
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:24,980
We'll get it for now.

1840
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:26,500
It might be good to have at least.

1841
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:28,620
Let me trash.

1842
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:29,500
Throw away you.

1843
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,240
Throw away you.

1844
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:46,020
Hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum, hum.

1845
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,320
We'll keep you for now.

1846
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:49,800
Free restocks.

1847
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:50,940
Oh, let's get that.

1848
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:53,180
It doesn't take up space.

1849
02:02:55,280 --> 02:03:01,600
I almost want to restock for like maybe a better bell thing, but...

1850
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:17,840
This might actually be good because we have the lemons too.

1851
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:19,520
You know?

1852
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,760
Because we have the lemons with the modifiers.

1853
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:28,280
Having them trigger an additional time would be pretty good, I think.

1854
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,860
Well, you got a lot of tickets and no ticket scaling items.

1855
02:03:33,020 --> 02:03:34,100
I have...

1856
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:36,680
Just... I have this.

1857
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:39,660
And I thought I got one other thing.

1858
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,000
This, I got this.

1859
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,620
Yeah, and the wallet.

1860
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:49,760
So we have two.

1861
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,660
Is there anything that you guys know of that I should be aiming for?

1862
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:59,300
Like any sort of item that will do with the ticket scaling.

1863
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:02,660
So many.

1864
02:04:02,940 --> 02:04:03,260
I know.

1865
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:05,680
You need to recharge it.

1866
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:06,400
Yeah, exactly.

1867
02:04:06,540 --> 02:04:08,300
If I do the P, I need to recharge.

1868
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:14,940
Yeah, most of the ones I could think of.

1869
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:16,660
Reroll for Charm Space.

1870
02:04:16,740 --> 02:04:17,220
Oh, true!

1871
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:18,500
Let's do that.

1872
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:21,080
Oh my god!

1873
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:22,760
How lucky you!

1874
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:24,140
Oh my gosh!

1875
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:28,500
Insane!

1876
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:30,860
Oh my god!

1877
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:34,000
Holy cow!

1878
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:37,120
I guess I could just equip it, huh?

1879
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:45,980
um equipment for now all right why not let's go 10 out of 10

1880
02:04:49,080 --> 02:05:10,160
wow oh we're still at oh sorry just hit my mic we're still at three rounds so let's let's go in wait there we go let's go let's go get my eye the sphere oh oops I forgot to...

1881
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:11,480
Oops, I forgot to press a button.

1882
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:12,200
We're fine now.

1883
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:14,100
It wouldn't have mattered.

1884
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:14,940
It wouldn't have mattered.

1885
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:16,940
It wouldn't have mattered.

1886
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:34,380
I guess maybe it was dumb to use it without having used the...

1887
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:37,000
But the thing is, is they're disproportionate.

1888
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:41,120
I'll show you.

1889
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:44,840
Or am I a liar?

1890
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:48,460
Oh no, see, because this one's 5 and this one's 4.

1891
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:52,040
be the same.

1892
02:05:52,820 --> 02:05:53,740
Always look for a battery.

1893
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:55,340
Yeah, I could look for a battery.

1894
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:58,040
This one is for... Okay, it's not for bells.

1895
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:59,360
Okay, I'm gonna reroll.

1896
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:02,640
No!

1897
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:07,790
I like stuff with luck.

1898
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:12,150
Gold star.

1899
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:13,830
No, I don't think we need that.

1900
02:06:15,310 --> 02:06:15,990
One more.

1901
02:06:16,170 --> 02:06:16,510
One more.

1902
02:06:17,990 --> 02:06:18,650
What's this?

1903
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:21,310
Maybe you discard a Charbon for the Table Banit.

1904
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:25,470
When you discard Virago, And then that charm respawn it and equip it immediately.

1905
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:38,600
It's a refresh type of item.

1906
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:47,460
It's complicated.

1907
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:49,300
Yeah, I'm kind of like, huh?

1908
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:54,340
So, forces you, the item so you can have more in your max base.

1909
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:55,940
Ah, okay, okay.

1910
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:57,780
So it would be like 11 out of 10.

1911
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:00,080
Got it, got it, got it.

1912
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:01,420
Okay, okay.

1913
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:03,640
I'm gonna reroll one more time.

1914
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:06,120
Oh, wait.

1915
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:06,920
It's only a thousand.

1916
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:07,780
It's so cheap.

1917
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,980
I could go for interest again.

1918
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:23,020
Vine soup.

1919
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:30,360
I honestly, I don't even have enough space.

1920
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:32,620
I'm like, should I even...

1921
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,240
Both interest and...

1922
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:43,540
Yeah, not Clovers.

1923
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:44,220
Bell.

1924
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:45,540
Or you mean the tickets.

1925
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:46,060
Yeah, yeah.

1926
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:48,340
I'm kind of doing like interest and tickets right now.

1927
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:49,140
Yeah.

1928
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1929
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:54,660
Oh, more interest.

1930
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:05,900
I can't...

1931
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:09,860
I don't feel like I can replace the bricks until I have another thing with the modifier.

1932
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:11,360
To be honest.

1933
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,920
Like a thing with the bells for the modifier.

1934
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:15,540
Something else with the modifier.

1935
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:18,780
The modifier is big money at the moment.

1936
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:21,620
Replace the iron.

1937
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:25,540
too because we have this guy.

1938
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:39,220
I feel like the modifier is like good to have, but like the iron is okay to have, but it's not necessary.

1939
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:41,620
I'll put it in the drawer for now.

1940
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:45,860
And I might do more house.

1941
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:53,480
Part of me is like oh my gosh, I want to do more interest, but I want more stuff for my tickets.

1942
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:56,760
I don't

1943
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,000
know, I'm just gonna go rollin.

1944
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:04,060
I'm gonna go.

1945
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:06,140
I'm gonna go rollin.

1946
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:10,890
Let's go.

1947
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:13,370
Well,

1948
02:09:17,940 --> 02:09:19,880
true, the Clover Pot will give us a lot of tickets.

1949
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:21,100
That's so true!

1950
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:23,100
You're so right, actually.

1951
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:26,240
Yeah.

1952
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:32,480
Is this still triggered or no?

1953
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,380
Oh, during the round.

1954
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:36,360
Oh, lame.

1955
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,300
Um, I'll hold...

1956
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:40,660
Wait, I didn't even grab my money.

1957
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:45,530
I'm my buddy!

1958
02:09:45,930 --> 02:09:47,110
I'm so out of it.

1959
02:09:47,830 --> 02:09:48,470
They'll sync up.

1960
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:49,370
Now they will, true.

1961
02:09:49,450 --> 02:09:50,270
They'll sync up now.

1962
02:09:56,060 --> 02:09:59,020
If we are getting more tickets from...

1963
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:01,820
No, okay, okay, okay.

1964
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:05,300
I know.

1965
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:07,320
I'm so...

1966
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:08,000
I'm so...

1967
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:14,160
Rich, I don't even need the petty change that comes from the machine.

1968
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:16,040
Don't pity me.

1969
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:19,160
Wait, where did this modify?

1970
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:21,580
Is it you?

1971
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:26,120
Oh, I do have a token modifier.

1972
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:30,500
Wait, then I guess I don't need the bricks.

1973
02:10:31,120 --> 02:10:31,980
Okay, just kidding.

1974
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:41,100
Oh, you nasty lemon you.

1975
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:44,320
I completely forgot.

1976
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:47,020
Okay.

1977
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:50,700
We can get rid of the bricks.

1978
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:52,900
Goodbye bricks.

1979
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:56,740
That's so funny.

1980
02:10:58,160 --> 02:10:58,980
Thank you.

1981
02:10:59,460 --> 02:10:59,660
Okay.

1982
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,520
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1983
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:03,120
Alright.

1984
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:05,260
What I'm gonna do is get rid of the bricks.

1985
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:06,920
Oh, goodbye, my interest.

1986
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:09,260
Goodbye, my interest.

1987
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:17,680
I am hesitant on the iron.

1988
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:20,520
I'll put it in the drawer for now.

1989
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:21,760
We have two spots.

1990
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,440
I'm going to grab the pepper because...

1991
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:25,320
Hell yeah, pepper.

1992
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:28,620
And...

1993
02:11:28,620 --> 02:11:30,220
The clover pet...

1994
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:33,460
Well, clover pet, we can equip now, I suppose.

1995
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:34,340
I guess it's fine.

1996
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:36,880
Clover pot.

1997
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,660
Because I have one more round still.

1998
02:11:40,780 --> 02:11:42,540
I just have to deposit it.

1999
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:48,320
I'm gonna reroll one more time.

2000
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:49,460
Another pepper!

2001
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:52,540
I'll grab it.

2002
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:54,820
More luck, baby.

2003
02:11:55,020 --> 02:11:55,600
More luck.

2004
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:00,100
Let's go, gambling.

2005
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:00,520
Wait!

2006
02:12:10,940 --> 02:12:13,280
Didn't think this game would click with me this much?

2007
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:15,580
Um...

2008
02:12:15,580 --> 02:12:17,260
Me neither, to be honest.

2009
02:12:19,860 --> 02:12:20,820
Me neither.

2010
02:12:21,580 --> 02:12:23,240
I think it's because I...

2011
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:24,040
I don't know.

2012
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:24,880
There's like...

2013
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:32,240
Usually games like this where there's so many options kind of stress me out because I'm like, I can do everything in the world.

2014
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:39,900
But there's also an aspect of just letting it happen, which I kind of like.

2015
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:44,920
Just putting your heart in the cards.

2016
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:47,420
Jackpot!

2017
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:01,760
You also don't have to play completely perfectly.

2018
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:02,780
Yeah, exactly.

2019
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:08,620
I like that, you know, Sometimes you might have something in mind that you want.

2020
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:14,780
But you have to get creative and go with other methods or something.

2021
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:20,240
It's just kind of fun.

2022
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:22,800
What is...

2023
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:23,580
Oh, the iron.

2024
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:27,100
I'm throwing it away, guys.

2025
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:28,140
I'm throwing away the iron.

2026
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:29,940
I think we did pretty well without it.

2027
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:33,780
Two, thank you!

2028
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:37,640
If you escaped, would that count as a game?

2029
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:46,960
completed i will leave that up to you guys i got the clever pot yes i did okay

2030
02:13:50,880 --> 02:14:04,700
yahoo not yahoo no he got mad at me it's an ending okay we'll count it then no

2031
02:14:14,150 --> 02:14:15,330
No deal.

2032
02:14:16,510 --> 02:14:17,090
No deal.

2033
02:14:19,370 --> 02:14:21,190
Oh, we got the battery guy.

2034
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:24,850
Oh, wait.

2035
02:14:25,010 --> 02:14:26,460
I gotta check the drawers first.

2036
02:14:27,970 --> 02:14:29,310
Golden bell.

2037
02:14:34,310 --> 02:14:35,410
Electricity meter.

2038
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:37,630
Every time you restock the store, recharge one.

2039
02:14:38,230 --> 02:14:39,790
Oh, meh.

2040
02:14:40,690 --> 02:14:41,430
The bell.

2041
02:14:42,050 --> 02:14:42,650
Red the purple.

2042
02:14:44,290 --> 02:14:44,710
Fortunately.

2043
02:14:44,770 --> 02:14:45,330
tell her.

2044
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:01,270
You guys once?

2045
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:16,690
Once I had the thing that was like double your Clover tickets and set your coins to zero and then I had to double your money and set your tickets to zero and then I had to activate the other current phone abilities and I was like well maybe it will double everything.

2046
02:15:17,050 --> 02:15:17,230
No.

2047
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:26,290
It set everything and it set It set everything to zero.

2048
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:35,460
It set everything to zero.

2049
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:39,860
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

2050
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:45,960
Calling John Faith to ward away the sixes.

2051
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:47,000
Thank you.

2052
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:47,780
Thank you.

2053
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:51,600
You guys said don't do the red ones, right?

2054
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:53,600
Oh.

2055
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:54,880
Uh-oh.

2056
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:06,160
Oh, I can?

2057
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:06,560
It's okay?

2058
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:08,260
Oh, okay, thank you.

2059
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:10,560
Then why did I...

2060
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:11,440
Oh,

2061
02:16:16,820 --> 02:16:17,520
I did one already.

2062
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:17,840
Oh!

2063
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:19,480
Okay, got it.

2064
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:21,060
I'm gonna do half the base.

2065
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:23,140
Yeah, I'm gonna do that one.

2066
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:25,680
Okay.

2067
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:27,120
Okay.

2068
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:28,500
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

2069
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:31,020
So many noises, I'm gonna say...

2070
02:16:31,020 --> 02:16:31,300
Wait.

2071
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:32,700
I'm gonna say no.

2072
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:34,920
No, thank you.

2073
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:35,460
Sorry.

2074
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:36,240
Sorry.

2075
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:40,700
Okay, 2000.

2076
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,040
Um, wait.

2077
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:50,140
Let's get rid of...

2078
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:51,720
This is, like, a legendary one.

2079
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,500
I feel, though, how many times...

2080
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:57,580
I don't have, like, any restock things.

2081
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:01,020
So, I'm, like, you know, I don't have anything...

2082
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:04,060
Any items that would add restocks to my...

2083
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:06,560
To my...

2084
02:17:07,740 --> 02:17:10,720
Store, so I think I'm just gonna throw it away.

2085
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:13,520
It's when you re-roll.

2086
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:14,500
Yeah, yeah.

2087
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:17,020
Yeah, exactly.

2088
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:26,560
Whenever you re-roll, it restores.

2089
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:31,180
I know, but what I'm saying is, there's sometimes items that you have, like, the restock.

2090
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,960
That adds, like, free restocks, and I don't have that.

2091
02:17:37,380 --> 02:17:40,620
So, I'm thinking, like, I wouldn't need this.

2092
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:44,360
So I'm throwing it away.

2093
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:49,860
And then we have the fortune tell.

2094
02:17:50,220 --> 02:17:52,500
Okay, let me store you.

2095
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:54,720
Put in your bar.

2096
02:17:56,900 --> 02:17:58,860
You have eight left.

2097
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:03,700
Yeah, see like the shopping cart where it's every...

2098
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:05,360
Simple multiple.

2099
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:06,880
For every free stock.

2100
02:18:07,980 --> 02:18:09,420
And then you earn a restock.

2101
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,480
Things like that.

2102
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:13,980
Fortune teller is huge, is it?

2103
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:18,560
Don't have many deadlines left.

2104
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:19,940
I guess that's fair.

2105
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:22,940
There's this little guy.

2106
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:24,840
I'll put you.

2107
02:18:26,060 --> 02:18:27,100
We'll keep the red pepper.

2108
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:32,180
I guess I don't really need this bell, do I?

2109
02:18:32,540 --> 02:18:36,680
It doesn't give me more chance of a bell, so I think I'm gonna get rid of it.

2110
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:39,320
Am I sinking in quicksand?

2111
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:41,420
Yep, I'm drowning in debt, baby.

2112
02:18:42,060 --> 02:18:43,280
So throw away.

2113
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:46,800
It's good if you have a jackpot.

2114
02:18:46,940 --> 02:18:49,660
I guess that's fair, but...

2115
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:52,540
I think we can get it again.

2116
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:54,860
I feel like the treasures are pretty common.

2117
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:58,260
I will reroll once!

2118
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:05,020
Let's go gambling!

2119
02:19:10,380 --> 02:19:10,940
Pepper.

2120
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:12,600
Oh no.

2121
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:33,780
Oh my money!

2122
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:37,440
Oh, my mind.

2123
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:52,630
Easy come?

2124
02:19:52,830 --> 02:19:57,750
I don't know if the easy come part is real, but definitely easy go.

2125
02:20:00,150 --> 02:20:01,630
Oh, that really hurt.

2126
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:03,090
Oh, that was painful.

2127
02:20:13,650 --> 02:20:14,210
Wait?

2128
02:20:14,210 --> 02:20:14,770
Jackpot?

2129
02:20:15,150 --> 02:20:15,510
No.

2130
02:20:19,810 --> 02:20:20,930
I have...

2131
02:20:20,930 --> 02:20:23,110
Pledge defeat from the jaws of victory.

2132
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:29,330
Well, I made it all back.

2133
02:20:31,730 --> 02:20:33,610
I got it all back at least.

2134
02:20:33,910 --> 02:20:35,970
Oh, but I don't want to deposit it!

2135
02:20:36,990 --> 02:20:38,490
Don't ruin my round!

2136
02:20:45,630 --> 02:20:46,850
Let's go gambling.

2137
02:20:47,070 --> 02:20:47,250
What?

2138
02:20:51,300 --> 02:20:52,760
Definitely a setback.

2139
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:55,500
Yes, but we push forward.

2140
02:20:56,420 --> 02:20:56,920
Push, push!

2141
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:02,920
Good luck, thank you!

2142
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:05,140
Why'd you guys say six?

2143
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:08,600
Oh, you're trying to manifest a six, six, six?

2144
02:21:11,300 --> 02:21:12,220
Quit it.

2145
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:19,380
Oh!

2146
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:20,020
Ooh!

2147
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:26,050
Music to my ears.

2148
02:21:26,590 --> 02:21:27,590
Why does the game hate me?

2149
02:21:27,690 --> 02:21:28,950
Why does it make me have fire?

2150
02:21:29,630 --> 02:21:30,990
666Y, why do you hate me?

2151
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:45,440
Big money!

2152
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:49,720
I think I have to wait, though.

2153
02:21:50,460 --> 02:21:51,840
I won't press the button.

2154
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:54,720
I won't press the button.

2155
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:55,580
Oh, wait.

2156
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:56,100
No, no.

2157
02:21:56,340 --> 02:21:56,500
What?

2158
02:21:56,580 --> 02:21:58,140
I don't want to... I'm scared!

2159
02:21:58,380 --> 02:21:59,160
I think...

2160
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:02,420
I think I'm gonna...

2161
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:04,640
I'll wait that moment.

2162
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:09,980
I think I should... I think I should deposit it.

2163
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:11,340
The clover pot.

2164
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:11,920
Oh, thank you guys.

2165
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:12,340
Thank you.

2166
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:14,160
Yes, yes, yes.

2167
02:22:14,860 --> 02:22:15,500
Let's... wait.

2168
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:16,180
Just get it.

2169
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:17,000
Or...

2170
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:19,900
Put it in drawer.

2171
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:24,080
Equip.

2172
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:26,240
Interest will save you.

2173
02:22:26,980 --> 02:22:28,000
It's not that much!

2174
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:32,380
I mean, yes, I could lose it all and still win, but...

2175
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:32,900
I'm scared!

2176
02:22:36,950 --> 02:22:37,470
Wait.

2177
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:40,030
Wait, I can just win.

2178
02:22:40,890 --> 02:22:41,410
Wait!

2179
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:44,010
Guys, did we do it?

2180
02:22:45,710 --> 02:22:46,510
It's enough!

2181
02:22:48,310 --> 02:22:49,630
Oh my gosh, no way.

2182
02:22:53,010 --> 02:22:55,510
No way, no way, no way!

2183
02:22:56,730 --> 02:22:59,030
Oh, that's mine.

2184
02:22:59,630 --> 02:23:00,890
Oh, hello, coin.

2185
02:23:04,550 --> 02:23:10,050
Getting three free restocks at the store whenever you score both Clovers and Bells in a single spin.

2186
02:23:19,590 --> 02:23:21,550
Oh, I think I already have that in there.

2187
02:23:21,690 --> 02:23:22,550
Cherry, throw it.

2188
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:28,690
Mm-hmm.

2189
02:23:31,050 --> 02:23:32,370
What are my lucky charms?

2190
02:23:33,230 --> 02:23:33,410
Oh.

2191
02:23:36,690 --> 02:23:37,150
Ah!

2192
02:23:39,730 --> 02:23:41,250
Take the money and run.

2193
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:44,290
Take the deal?

2194
02:23:45,130 --> 02:23:46,750
Okay, I'll take the deal.

2195
02:23:47,090 --> 02:23:47,750
Hold on.

2196
02:23:48,550 --> 02:23:50,270
Um, I'm gonna take this one.

2197
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:51,070
Why not?

2198
02:23:51,350 --> 02:23:52,670
We'll just add some more...

2199
02:23:54,350 --> 02:23:57,870
We'll add more... more tickets.

2200
02:23:59,050 --> 02:23:59,470
I suppose.

2201
02:24:00,670 --> 02:24:02,930
Here we go.

2202
02:24:03,450 --> 02:24:04,330
I'm taking the deal.

2203
02:24:06,890 --> 02:24:09,330
The banker offers you a key to win the game.

2204
02:24:10,690 --> 02:24:11,570
Or no deal?

2205
02:24:12,770 --> 02:24:13,530
Deal?

2206
02:24:23,790 --> 02:24:24,730
Or no deal?

2207
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:26,970
I say...

2208
02:24:26,990 --> 02:24:28,090
Damn!

2209
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:33,660
Whoa.

2210
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:37,840
What'd we get?

2211
02:24:39,740 --> 02:24:40,580
Okay.

2212
02:24:43,640 --> 02:24:44,140
Whoa.

2213
02:24:48,660 --> 02:24:51,180
Are you sure you really want that?

2214
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:54,440
Give me all my tickets?

2215
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:59,000
Guys, we did it.

2216
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:00,240
We did it!

2217
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:03,580
Ah!

2218
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:06,560
You asshole.

2219
02:25:06,980 --> 02:25:08,260
Why would you give me that now?

2220
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:15,240
Wait, but this run was so good!

2221
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:20,520
This run was so good!

2222
02:25:20,980 --> 02:25:23,600
Oh my gosh!

2223
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:24,620
Oh my gosh!

2224
02:25:25,940 --> 02:25:27,400
Because of work has been insane!

2225
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:29,840
God, I'm so sorry work has been crazy!

2226
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:32,440
Thank you so much, thank you.

2227
02:25:34,260 --> 02:25:35,060
You can keep playing.

2228
02:25:35,380 --> 02:25:35,820
Wait, okay.

2229
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:39,000
If I...

2230
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:44,260
If I lose, if I don't have enough money in a run...

2231
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:48,180
You can keep going and just open the door if you can't meet the deadline.

2232
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:49,320
So I can, right?

2233
02:25:49,400 --> 02:25:51,680
I could just be like, okay, I'm dipping and leave.

2234
02:25:53,940 --> 02:25:55,400
Just leave before the floor drops.

2235
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:55,720
Okay!

2236
02:25:58,580 --> 02:25:59,720
Sounds good to me?

2237
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:00,900
What do we got?

2238
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:01,980
Oh, bells.

2239
02:26:02,660 --> 02:26:03,320
Bells, bells.

2240
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:04,240
We need more bells.

2241
02:26:04,260 --> 02:26:08,100
Oh, what do we have here?

2242
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:09,700
Horseshoe.

2243
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:11,820
Clover picture.

2244
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:12,760
Throw away.

2245
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:18,180
Cherry picture.

2246
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:20,040
Throw away.

2247
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:25,460
Obsessive.

2248
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:27,640
Every last pattern triggers one more time.

2249
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:29,120
That would be huge.

2250
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:30,500
Could be good.

2251
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:32,700
Store you.

2252
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:35,460
And what do we have?

2253
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:36,920
The horseshoe equipment.

2254
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:39,200
And then...

2255
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:40,080
How many do you have left?

2256
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:40,740
Three?

2257
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:43,760
Okay.

2258
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:48,210
Oh, I don't have enough money.

2259
02:26:48,390 --> 02:26:49,070
I just realized.

2260
02:26:52,530 --> 02:26:54,110
The store is closing soon.

2261
02:26:54,290 --> 02:26:56,270
No, I have an hour and a half.

2262
02:26:56,430 --> 02:26:56,750
I'm okay.

2263
02:26:57,370 --> 02:26:57,910
Thank you, though.

2264
02:26:58,150 --> 02:26:59,190
I really appreciate it.

2265
02:27:00,330 --> 02:27:02,470
You really don't know when to stop!

2266
02:27:03,570 --> 02:27:04,010
Let's...

2267
02:27:04,010 --> 02:27:04,210
Wait.

2268
02:27:06,210 --> 02:27:07,450
Let's go gambling!

2269
02:27:07,630 --> 02:27:07,990
Hi!

2270
02:27:18,220 --> 02:27:18,820
Crazy!

2271
02:27:27,090 --> 02:27:28,910
Whoa, I got something new!

2272
02:27:29,590 --> 02:27:30,250
Look at that, V.

2273
02:27:31,230 --> 02:27:31,810
Exciting?

2274
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:38,840
Guys, I think we

2275
02:27:53,220 --> 02:27:55,220
We hit, we hit it.

2276
02:28:00,310 --> 02:28:01,550
Doop doop.

2277
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:05,840
And again!

2278
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:07,360
Spin, spin, spin!

2279
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:15,680
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again.

2280
02:28:20,850 --> 02:28:21,490
Alrighty.

2281
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:24,530
Take that.

2282
02:28:24,610 --> 02:28:25,190
What did we get?

2283
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:26,510
Wait!

2284
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:36,780
20% chance for any bell to have the token modifier.

2285
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:39,920
Nah, well, thank you so much for the love.

2286
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:40,800
Thank you.

2287
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:45,440
Thank you so much.

2288
02:28:46,120 --> 02:28:47,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2289
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:51,700
Okay.

2290
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:56,600
Deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit.

2291
02:28:58,620 --> 02:28:59,980
I could lose it all.

2292
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:03,800
I could lose it all today.

2293
02:29:04,900 --> 02:29:05,540
What's that one?

2294
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:06,280
What's that one?

2295
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:07,340
That video.

2296
02:29:08,940 --> 02:29:10,820
The earth is dying.

2297
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:13,960
The animals can't talk to us.

2298
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:16,560
The aliens won't talk to us.

2299
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:20,760
The people are sad.

2300
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:22,820
We're all alone.

2301
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:27,100
But do you really need anyone else?

2302
02:29:28,740 --> 02:29:29,900
Oh, come on.

2303
02:29:29,940 --> 02:29:31,160
I was supposed to get a jackpot.

2304
02:29:44,010 --> 02:29:46,250

02:29:53,760 --> 02:30:18,500

My number is definitely money is going up.

2308
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:34,980
Oh, oops, sorry.

2309
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:38,000
I clicked extra.

2310
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:40,000
Getting lucky.

2311
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:41,860
I think we are.

2312
02:30:42,420 --> 02:30:42,900
Truly.

2313
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:44,460
What is this at?

2314
02:30:46,180 --> 02:30:47,680
Five percent left.

2315
02:30:47,820 --> 02:31:20,600

2316
02:31:30,920 --> 02:31:32,800
Fake coin could be good.

2317
02:31:43,070 --> 02:31:44,410
For PT or calculator.

2318
02:31:45,370 --> 02:31:46,050
What is a PT?

2319
02:31:46,410 --> 02:31:47,310
Oh, the personal trainer.

2320
02:31:50,130 --> 02:31:51,770
Let the number go, Puvio!

2321
02:31:51,990 --> 02:31:52,570
Thank you!

2322
02:31:53,350 --> 02:31:54,830

Thank you, Joaquin, thank you so much for the 50.

Ew, yes, I quit.

2330

Okay.

2331
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:31,220
Can't break me down.

2332
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:34,300
Bury me, bury me!

2333
02:32:35,140 --> 02:32:36,120
Yippee!

02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:41,450
How do I make it go faster?

2350
02:33:41,930 --> 02:33:42,990
Do I just hold down the screen?

2351
02:33:44,810 --> 02:33:45,110
Oh!

02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:50,080

02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:52,520
I don't know.

2355
02:33:53,340 --> 02:33:54,840
Oh, it's a setting.

2356
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:56,900

2419
02:38:07,510 --> 02:38:10,170
How often, like, I feel like...

2420
02:38:12,050 --> 02:38:13,190
What a thrill.

2421
02:38:13,430 --> 02:38:14,690
It truly is the thrill.

2422
02:38:16,170 --> 02:38:16,350
Oh!

2423
02:38:17,330 --> 02:38:18,070
Oh, wait.

2424
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:18,590
I forgot.

2425
02:38:19,030 --> 02:38:19,830
It's a new round.

2426
02:38:21,670 --> 02:38:23,090
You always have an out.

2427
02:38:23,810 --> 02:38:25,210
One more try!

2428
02:38:26,210 --> 02:38:27,410
We do always have an out.

2429
02:38:33,870 --> 02:38:36,170
It doesn't feel like... I feel like it's lying.

2430
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:38,410
The machine lying to us?

2431
02:38:39,570 --> 02:38:39,970
No.

2432
02:38:39,970 --> 02:38:41,510
No possible way.

2433
02:38:43,030 --> 02:38:44,830
Oh, I used up all my... Okay, hold on.

2434
02:38:44,910 --> 02:38:45,830
I'm gonna equip this.

2435
02:38:47,410 --> 02:38:48,430
Because what if it charges?

2436
02:38:49,170 --> 02:38:49,870
That'd be crazy.

2437
02:38:50,070 --> 02:38:51,230
Oh wait, they are charged.

2438
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:13,820
Is that a jar of piss?

2439
02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:15,000
It is actually.

2440
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,880
The dynamo is pretty good with my horseshoe.

2441
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,040
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

2442
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:21,900
That was... That's what I was thinking too.

2443
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:24,700
Let's just go for it.

2444
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:26,120
Let's go gambling.

2445
02:39:26,660 --> 02:39:27,500
Okay, hold on.

2446
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:30,800
If it's...

2447
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:33,040
40% chance is really good too.

2448
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:38,740
So, if I do that, you know, it's...

2449
02:39:38,740 --> 02:39:39,120
Uh oh.

2450
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,140
It might be pretty good.

2451
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:46,400
So now it's 80%.

2452
02:39:46,400 --> 02:39:49,480
Yeah, so we could just constantly be pressing the button.

2453
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:52,260
You know?

2454
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:57,140
so scary it's so stinking scary

2455
02:40:12,300 --> 02:40:18,540
what's my bell percentage 58 58 no no biggie

2456
02:40:25,780 --> 02:40:36,640
i'm kind of shocked at how little wait is this like something i need to activate oh oh at the end of each round okay okay at the end i was like why is it not happening.

2457
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:37,500
Uh-oh.

2458
02:40:41,900 --> 02:40:42,840
You're gonna make me sick.

2459
02:40:42,940 --> 02:40:44,240
This game is gonna make me sick.

2460
02:40:49,660 --> 02:40:52,500
I was last in line, so they were all kept you waiting, huh?

2461
02:40:53,420 --> 02:40:54,860
That's so fun!

2462
02:40:55,180 --> 02:40:59,980
Part of me is like kicking myself or not going, but honestly I really couldn't.

2463
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:07,440
But it looked amazing.

2464
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:08,600
I'm glad you had fun.

2465
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:10,080
Oh!

2466
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:10,940
Oh dang.

2467
02:41:11,220 --> 02:41:12,540
I thought this was gonna be a jackpot.

2468
02:41:12,900 --> 02:41:19,090
Come to America, please!

2469
02:41:19,690 --> 02:41:23,370
Please, I know the US gets so much all the time, but I'm greedy.

2470
02:41:25,490 --> 02:41:27,130
I'm greedy, please!

2471
02:41:30,090 --> 02:41:33,430
Just a little Metal Gear in concert as a treat!

2472
02:41:37,250 --> 02:41:44,470
Did it not do it?

2473
02:41:47,290 --> 02:41:49,250
Her greed sickens me.

2474
02:41:50,330 --> 02:41:51,970
Please, I'm greedy, I'm greedy.

2475
02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:56,470
Oh my gosh, I just realized how much money we have compared to the deadline.

2476
02:41:57,050 --> 02:41:58,470
I could lose it all right now.

2477
02:42:00,230 --> 02:42:01,610
I could, I could lose it all.

2478
02:42:05,110 --> 02:42:07,470
And that's part of the game, baby!

2479
02:42:19,230 --> 02:42:21,470
Next deadline is 144 million.

2480
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:22,350
Okay, you're right.

2481
02:42:24,110 --> 02:42:26,370
Wait, did I forget to press the button?

2482
02:42:26,690 --> 02:42:27,010
Oops.

2483
02:42:29,770 --> 02:42:30,390
What is that?

2484
02:42:30,730 --> 02:42:31,670
Whoa, what is that?

2485
02:42:35,510 --> 02:42:35,950
Um...

2486
02:42:35,950 --> 02:42:39,250
This is only for a round, so I guess I could still do it.

2487
02:42:42,270 --> 02:42:43,150
Big pepper.

2488
02:42:45,330 --> 02:42:45,950
Big pepper.

2489
02:42:56,460 --> 02:42:57,340
Spicy run?

2490
02:42:57,800 --> 02:42:59,020
He says spicy pepper.

2491
02:42:59,740 --> 02:43:01,060
I want to see what it is, though.

2492
02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:04,180
Oh my god, jackpot!

2493
02:43:06,760 --> 02:43:12,960
If you really want this run to take off, get a red phone call, call two time ticket option with the megaphone.

2494
02:43:14,820 --> 02:43:17,340
I mean, I have to get super lucky.

2495
02:43:20,760 --> 02:43:23,780
And it'll be again, again!

2496
02:43:24,660 --> 02:43:25,640
Super jackpot!

2497
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:27,980
Yay!

2498
02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:32,020
I love the applause.

2499
02:43:34,520 --> 02:43:36,620
Applause, applause, applause, uh oh.

2500
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:40,680
Another funny applause, applause,

02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:45,480

2502
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:50,480
I love having a luck buff.

2503
02:43:54,380 --> 02:43:56,160
She let me like, you guys have concerts?

2504
02:43:56,400 --> 02:43:57,420
I know, I know!

2505
02:43:58,020 --> 02:43:59,840
The US gets so much, I'm sorry!

2506
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:01,300
I'm greedy!

2507
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:01,780
Uh oh.

2508
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:05,520
Holy cow, can you imagine losing it all?

2509
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:10,640
in the losing it all in the final spin

2510
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:47,240

2511
02:44:52,760 --> 02:44:59,600

02:45:01,300 --> 02:45:12,560
it's way more than we thought i forgot the i forgot the pot again i'm sorry i forgot the That clover pot again, everybody.

2513
02:45:15,360 --> 02:45:17,140
That is my fault.

2514
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:22,600
I got a red pepper.

2515
02:45:24,060 --> 02:45:25,940
We often say you deserve the world.

2516
02:45:26,380 --> 02:45:27,460
Why shouldn't you get everything?

2517
02:45:27,660 --> 02:45:28,880
I can't see the reason.

2518
02:45:29,580 --> 02:45:32,500
Why does it keep giving me this dang ritual, though?

2519
02:45:33,140 --> 02:45:34,880
Get out of my afterlife.

2520
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:37,900
Rip, like, 200 tickets.

2521
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:38,840
Yeah, actually.

2522
02:45:39,820 --> 02:45:40,760
244 tickets.

2523
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:47,440
Uh, electrician is so much better than the- I- I- honestly this thing has been useless.

2524
02:45:49,400 --> 02:46:00,200
How bad is the rate if I- If I don't even- like it's supposed to be 80%, but it's not recharging anything at all.

2525
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:02,500
Goodbye.

2526
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:09,780
Equip that little guy.

2527
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:12,400
I like how this thing is on fire.

2528
02:46:16,380 --> 02:46:17,220
I'll take that.

2529
02:46:17,320 --> 02:46:18,160
Oh, wait, the calculator!

2530
02:46:21,240 --> 02:46:24,780
Wait, is there a difference between broken calculator and calculator?

2531
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:30,840
I live for these applause, applause.

2532
02:46:31,020 --> 02:46:32,220
Yeah, the calculator is great.

2533
02:46:32,340 --> 02:46:33,580
Exactly, that's what I'm thinking.

2534
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:35,000
Oh.

2535
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:39,480
We'll put this guy away for now.

2536
02:46:39,700 --> 02:46:40,240
We'll buy that.

2537
02:46:41,560 --> 02:46:42,440
One is broken.

2538
02:46:43,660 --> 02:46:44,180
Is there...

2539
02:46:44,180 --> 02:46:46,300
No, what I meant is...

2540
02:46:47,340 --> 02:46:51,420
What I meant is...

2541
02:46:56,020 --> 02:46:56,520
Is...

2542
02:46:57,760 --> 02:46:58,760
Is...

2543
02:46:58,760 --> 02:47:00,660
They're a regular calculator.

2544
02:47:02,720 --> 02:47:05,600
Oh my gosh, a speculative trade!

2545
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:09,220
Don't mind if I do.

2546
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:11,020
Hold on though.

2547
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:21,400
Should be fine.

2548
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:24,920
Yay!

2549
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:28,720
You wanted a scientific calculator instead?

2550
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:30,920
Well, someone earlier was like, you should get the calculator.

2551
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:32,380
I was like, okay.

2552
02:47:34,720 --> 02:47:35,120
But...

2553
02:47:37,730 --> 02:47:39,630
No, this pepper is good, you guys.

2554
02:47:40,130 --> 02:47:41,270
This pepper doesn't disappear.

2555
02:47:41,830 --> 02:47:42,570
This is good pepper.

2556
02:47:43,250 --> 02:47:44,490
We got it on the PS.

2557
02:47:46,990 --> 02:47:47,370
PS.

2558
02:47:52,890 --> 02:47:53,290
Wow.

2559
02:47:53,890 --> 02:47:54,630
Do you think you guys...

2560
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:55,630
Do you guys think we'll make it?

2561
02:47:56,390 --> 02:47:58,510
Oh my gosh, that's how many subscribers I have.

2562
02:47:59,350 --> 02:48:00,870
Let's go, gambling, hoi!

2563
02:48:09,210 --> 02:48:10,730
You will make it.

2564
02:48:10,850 --> 02:48:11,950
You think so!

2565
02:48:13,370 --> 02:48:14,150
You really think so?

2566
02:48:14,490 --> 02:48:17,990
The Mint who can't sell the world because she spent all her money on gambling problems.

2567
02:48:25,540 --> 02:48:26,620
Again, again!

2568
02:48:32,190 --> 02:48:36,490
Oh my gosh, this is the most tickets I've ever had ever, ever in my afterlife.

2569
02:48:38,370 --> 02:48:40,470
This is why I love playing with you guys.

2570
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:47,360
What a great run.

2571
02:48:56,720 --> 02:49:01,740
In this house we say Gambling Solution.

2572
02:49:04,960 --> 02:49:06,680
Whispering good luck.

2573
02:49:06,980 --> 02:49:08,000
It's so true.

2574
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:11,480
You guys are my lucky charm.

2575
02:49:12,340 --> 02:49:13,280
Aw, so close.

2576
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:24,260
We literally kind of I have to grow my nose like three times maybe not like five times as big

2577
02:49:29,940 --> 02:49:40,780
I think we'll make it you guys I think we'll make it I think we'll make it I think we'll make it Small nose ten times okay

2578
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:53,340
Oh jackpot jackpot Music to my ears.

2579
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:59,260
I already made it.

2580
02:50:05,740 --> 02:50:07,020
Mamma mia.

2581
02:50:11,460 --> 02:50:12,080
Oh, again?

2582
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:14,040
Oh, jackpot!

2583
02:50:15,100 --> 02:50:16,600
Mamma mia!

2584
02:50:18,700 --> 02:50:21,240
Oh, once that was a whine!

2585
02:50:23,020 --> 02:50:24,740
Oh my gosh.

2586
02:50:27,620 --> 02:50:28,160
Again.

2587
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:29,220
Again, again, again!

2588
02:50:41,810 --> 02:50:42,330
That...

2589
02:50:42,330 --> 02:50:44,550
The little guy, though, is, like, giving us nothing.

2590
02:50:46,270 --> 02:50:49,550
Why am I having such bad luck with these recharges, I wonder?

2591
02:50:51,230 --> 02:50:51,730
Oh, wait!

2592
02:50:52,250 --> 02:50:53,290
I didn't equip him.

2593
02:50:55,670 --> 02:50:58,210
I forgot to equip him.

2594
02:51:00,210 --> 02:51:00,570
Oops.

2595
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,460
That would be why.

2596
02:51:11,880 --> 02:51:13,320
I could lose it all.

2597
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:20,880
The winner takes it all.

2598
02:51:22,240 --> 02:51:25,020
The loser has to fall.

2599
02:51:31,960 --> 02:51:33,400
Don't forget the pot, yeah.

2600
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:37,840
The minke takes it all.

2601
02:51:41,060 --> 02:51:42,720
I wonder if I should activate it, though.

2602
02:51:48,060 --> 02:51:49,920
With interest, you can't lose, true.

2603
02:51:52,520 --> 02:51:52,880
Oh.

2604
02:51:53,940 --> 02:51:54,880
Oh, a battery.

2605
02:51:58,480 --> 02:51:59,180
Jack-Full!

2606
02:52:04,510 --> 02:52:07,170
The Minky takes it off!

2607
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:13,030
So the Minky takes it off.

2608
02:52:13,850 --> 02:52:14,870
And the...

2609
02:52:17,630 --> 02:52:20,230
I love this nice, cozy, and chill stream.

2610
02:52:20,650 --> 02:52:21,510
Without any worries.

2611
02:52:21,910 --> 02:52:23,170
No worries.

2612
02:52:25,250 --> 02:52:26,850
No worries at all.

2613
02:52:28,690 --> 02:52:30,690
No fear, no fear.

2614
02:52:32,330 --> 02:52:34,690
We're too big to fail.

2615
02:52:36,730 --> 02:52:37,870
We're...

2616
02:52:37,870 --> 02:52:39,370
Until we're not.

2617
02:52:40,270 --> 02:52:40,390
Ah!

2618
02:52:42,570 --> 02:52:44,670
Wow, sevens.

2619
02:52:45,330 --> 02:52:46,170
Those are rare.

2620
02:52:49,590 --> 02:52:50,270
Beep, beep, beep.

2621
02:52:51,130 --> 02:52:51,710
Calculator.

2622
02:52:59,540 --> 02:53:00,110
Chuck!

2623
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:01,260
Puppy!

2624
02:53:08,860 --> 02:53:10,020
We've almost...

2625
02:53:10,020 --> 02:53:10,420
Is this...

2626
02:53:10,420 --> 02:53:11,560
Wait, will we hit E?

2627
02:53:15,870 --> 02:53:17,130
No, not yet.

2628
02:53:17,330 --> 02:53:18,190
No E yet.

2629
02:53:19,490 --> 02:53:20,250
No E yet.

2630
02:53:25,450 --> 02:53:27,590
Oh, we still have a round.

2631
02:53:28,330 --> 02:53:28,810
Wait.

2632
02:53:30,510 --> 02:53:32,550
We still have another round.

2633
02:53:34,630 --> 02:53:35,230
Ah!

2634
02:53:39,460 --> 02:53:40,340
I still don't.

2635
02:53:40,360 --> 02:53:41,720
I still don't understand EU, guys.

2636
02:53:41,900 --> 02:53:42,720
I seriously don't.

2637
02:53:49,140 --> 02:53:50,520
Gotta get to the trillions.

2638
02:53:51,080 --> 02:53:52,320
Yeah, we're only at a billions.

2639
02:53:58,880 --> 02:54:01,020
I still don't understand it, though.

2640
02:54:02,940 --> 02:54:04,500
I think we'll just keep going.

2641
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:05,560
As is.

2642
02:54:08,660 --> 02:54:09,140
Oh, no.

2643
02:54:13,480 --> 02:54:16,180
Thank you for always making me smile.

2644
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:16,960
I remember my day.

2645
02:54:17,080 --> 02:54:17,420
What the heck?

2646
02:54:17,660 --> 02:54:17,900
No!

2647
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:18,340
Hi!

2648
02:54:18,900 --> 02:54:20,180
Thank you!

2649
02:54:20,740 --> 02:54:22,420
Looking forward to receiving your 3D live version.

2650
02:54:22,580 --> 02:54:23,500
Thank you!

2651
02:54:24,820 --> 02:54:27,100
E10 is basically number of zero.

2652
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:30,260
I know, you guys have been trying to explain it to me so many times.

2653
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:33,120
I'm just too dumb to understand it.

2654
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:36,780
I'm really too dumb to get it, I think.

2655
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:43,500
My head, like, physically just can't wrap my brain around it.

2656
02:54:43,660 --> 02:54:44,720
It's too many numbers!

2657
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,300
Wait, did we get the charge?

2658
02:54:47,900 --> 02:54:48,760
Oh, we did get the charge.

2659
02:54:49,080 --> 02:54:49,200
Nice.

2660
02:54:52,420 --> 02:54:54,140
Maybe I'll look it up one day.

2661
02:54:57,400 --> 02:54:58,400
Oh, we got the charge!

2662
02:54:58,680 --> 02:54:59,020
Nice.

2663
02:55:03,440 --> 02:55:03,960
Yeah.

2664
02:55:12,340 --> 02:55:13,380
Jackball time.

2665
02:55:14,260 --> 02:55:16,380
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2666
02:55:16,620 --> 02:55:19,920
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

2667
02:55:19,940 --> 02:55:21,280
Money, money, money, money.

2668
02:55:23,820 --> 02:55:25,900
You know how to multiply by 10?

2669
02:55:27,460 --> 02:55:28,180
Yeah.

2670
02:55:28,980 --> 02:55:29,160
Yeah.

2671
02:55:30,020 --> 02:55:30,400
Yeah.

2672
02:55:30,780 --> 02:55:32,960
Everybody knows how to multiply by 10!

2673
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:49,600
What else do we have in here?

2674
02:55:49,720 --> 02:55:50,880
I have a pepper!

2675
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:51,980
Since when?

2676
02:55:55,160 --> 02:55:57,120
So the winner.

2677
02:55:58,780 --> 02:56:00,080
Takes it all.

2678
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:01,420
Oh, what are you at left?

2679
02:56:01,860 --> 02:56:02,920
3% left.

2680
02:56:03,520 --> 02:56:05,140
So we have three more turns?

2681
02:56:05,360 --> 02:56:07,540
Three more rounds with it.

2682
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:17,660
I'm trying.

2683
02:56:17,800 --> 02:56:22,140
I want to get as I want to get as many as we can, you know?

2684
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:23,840
I might even get rid of the pepper.

2685
02:56:26,420 --> 02:56:29,520
We could go for a plus seven luck pepper.

2686
02:56:41,080 --> 02:56:42,380
I think he did his job.

2687
02:56:42,740 --> 02:56:43,220
I think it's okay.

2688
02:56:49,350 --> 02:56:49,870
Uh...

2689
02:56:49,870 --> 02:56:50,650
Yes, okay.

2690
02:56:51,330 --> 02:56:51,330
Alright.

2691
02:56:53,190 --> 02:56:54,010
Beep, beep.

2692
02:57:00,780 --> 02:57:01,860
Oh, look at that!

2693
02:57:02,340 --> 02:57:03,340
Plus seven luck.

2694
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:09,520
At the end of each round, replace all lucky charms inside of drawers with new RAN OD20.

2695
02:57:10,980 --> 02:57:11,980
Throw away.

2696
02:57:12,380 --> 02:57:13,480
We don't need the wheelbarrow.

2697
02:57:14,740 --> 02:57:15,720
1k ticket!

2698
02:57:21,490 --> 02:57:22,430
Wait a second.

2699
02:57:27,150 --> 02:57:34,050
Wait, raise clovers and bells by their base value permanently for every three tickets you spend and 3% interest.

2700
02:57:34,550 --> 02:57:35,190
Wait, wait, wait.

2701
02:57:35,910 --> 02:57:37,190
I have so many tickets.

2702
02:57:42,700 --> 02:57:43,880
You need to buy a lot.

2703
02:57:44,140 --> 02:57:44,960
I would have to really...

2704
02:57:44,960 --> 02:57:47,700
This would be a really great early game, I think.

2705
02:57:50,220 --> 02:57:51,320
Good with the cigarettes.

2706
02:57:51,580 --> 02:57:52,160
Oh, yeah?

2707
02:57:53,900 --> 02:57:57,680
Yeah, true, because you could just keep buying the cigarettes and buying and buying and buying and buying.

2708
02:57:57,860 --> 02:57:58,040
Yeah.

2709
02:57:59,340 --> 02:57:59,980
Ah.

2710
02:58:02,900 --> 02:58:03,540
Takizo!

2711
02:58:03,880 --> 02:58:05,180
Thank you for the five!

2712
02:58:05,980 --> 02:58:06,800
Thank you!

2713
02:58:07,360 --> 02:58:08,580
Thank you, thank you.

2714
02:58:09,160 --> 02:58:10,820
Yeah, huge if you get the cigarettes.

2715
02:58:11,200 --> 02:58:11,860
So true.

2716
02:58:14,280 --> 02:58:18,320
E just multiplies by 10, so move the decimal one spot to the right.

2717
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:20,300
So I think E3 is a thousand.

2718
02:58:20,460 --> 02:58:21,240
One E3.

2719
02:58:22,540 --> 02:58:22,980
Oh!

2720
02:58:28,870 --> 02:58:30,610
One is 1.000.

2721
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:35,760
Okay.

2722
02:58:39,120 --> 02:58:39,600
Okay.

2723
02:58:40,660 --> 02:58:43,620
No, I don't mind you guys trying to explain it to me every time.

2724
02:58:43,800 --> 02:58:46,960
I really, because I seriously say I don't get it every single time.

2725
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:52,940
I seriously am saying like, I really don't get it every single time.

2726
02:58:53,440 --> 02:58:55,480
So I really don't mind that you guys keep trying.

2727
02:58:56,200 --> 02:58:56,680
Bells!

2728
02:58:56,920 --> 02:58:57,400
Bells!

2729
02:58:57,540 --> 02:58:58,020
Bells!

2730
02:58:58,020 --> 02:58:58,440
Bells!

2731
02:58:59,200 --> 02:58:59,680
Oh!

2732
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:01,960
Oh!

2733
02:59:01,980 --> 02:59:04,280
Bells, bells, we need more bells.

2734
02:59:05,080 --> 02:59:06,840
54% bells, baby.

2735
02:59:11,180 --> 02:59:13,160
And, uh, put you away.

2736
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:18,440
We can hold on to this, obviously.

2737
02:59:18,680 --> 02:59:20,440
I don't have to deal with it.

2738
02:59:20,600 --> 02:59:21,740
Let's throw this away.

2739
02:59:22,460 --> 02:59:23,940
It would be kind of crazy, though.

2740
02:59:25,400 --> 02:59:27,020
And we'll equip you for now.

2741
02:59:28,920 --> 02:59:29,480
Wait a second.

2742
02:59:32,960 --> 02:59:35,140
No, I think I'm gonna get rid of it.

2743
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:36,960
I think I'm gonna throw it away.

2744
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:39,300
I think I'm gonna throw it away.

2745
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:47,420
Symbols multiplier.

2746
02:59:51,780 --> 02:59:53,360
Next deadline, you're cooked.

2747
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:54,620
Am I?

2748
02:59:56,380 --> 02:59:57,540
I might be.

2749
02:59:58,760 --> 03:00:00,340
I think so, maybe.

2750
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:04,840
No pop quiz.

2751
03:00:05,080 --> 03:00:06,040
Oh, no, no!

2752
03:00:08,280 --> 03:00:08,740
Hmm.

2753
03:00:09,400 --> 03:00:10,080
It's okay.

2754
03:00:11,060 --> 03:00:14,140
Actually, I have to get going soon anyway, so let's just get into it.

2755
03:00:17,900 --> 03:00:18,100
Oh!

2756
03:00:18,480 --> 03:00:18,920
Wait.

2757
03:00:19,360 --> 03:00:19,960
I think I just lost.

2758
03:00:21,880 --> 03:00:24,560
Bring a symbol's chances to 60% or more.

2759
03:00:25,080 --> 03:00:25,760
Oh, nice.

2760
03:00:25,860 --> 03:00:27,080
This was the achievement I just got.

2761
03:00:33,850 --> 03:00:37,030
I have to get going anyway, because the store closes in an hour for me.

2762
03:00:43,570 --> 03:00:45,310
bells we need more bells

2763
03:00:52,400 --> 03:01:31,620
what store I'm going to the makeup store there was something that I saw that I want to try and get it's like a thing it's from this brand called the ordinary and I saw like a review on it and I was like wait I kind of want to try that it's like this how do you say it's like a lip I don't have to go today you know yubi but it's like a lip exfoliator so if you and I tend to get really dry lips around this time of the year and so it's to help with that game never ends when you need to go I know

2764
03:01:42,620 --> 03:01:45,620
hippie again again

2765
03:01:51,740 --> 03:01:59,680
it doesn't matter if I'm cooked if it feels good that's all that matters you know what I mean What?

2766
03:02:00,540 --> 03:02:01,420
Nice sub count.

2767
03:02:01,580 --> 03:02:03,040
Say, whispery, thank you.

2768
03:02:03,160 --> 03:02:04,340
Stay away from my wife.

2769
03:02:04,920 --> 03:02:06,060
No promises.

2770
03:02:09,780 --> 03:02:16,000
As long as it's a satisfying feeling like this, it feels good, you know?

2771
03:02:18,540 --> 03:02:19,580
I don't care.

2772
03:02:20,040 --> 03:02:21,620
I don't care if I'm done so.

2773
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:24,700
Uh-oh.

2774
03:02:27,160 --> 03:02:28,940
We were about to lose it all, everybody.

2775
03:02:31,360 --> 03:02:39,080
hide your kids hide your wife what year is it pulling that out in 2025

2776
03:02:47,190 --> 03:02:55,750
that's an oldie well i'm gonna get a cough drop real quick hide your kids hide your wife

2777
03:02:59,870 --> 03:03:02,690
equals d is not thank you

2778
03:03:05,770 --> 03:03:08,470
Thanks for the math lesson, Sensei.

2779
03:03:11,230 --> 03:03:15,670
Music to my ears.

2780
03:03:25,480 --> 03:03:26,120
Again!

2781
03:03:27,640 --> 03:03:28,280
Okay.

2782
03:03:30,380 --> 03:03:33,300
It's the one thing about the coin that scares me.

2783
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:38,040
But I guess since the 666 takes away all my money, it doesn't really matter.

2784
03:03:45,910 --> 03:03:46,390
Yay!

2785
03:03:48,690 --> 03:03:50,770
You ain't making it to the store?

2786
03:03:50,910 --> 03:03:51,930
I think I will!

2787
03:03:53,350 --> 03:03:54,850
Because I'm not gonna...

2788
03:03:54,850 --> 03:03:55,910
I'm not gonna live.

2789
03:03:57,110 --> 03:03:57,870
I'm not gonna live.

2790
03:03:58,210 --> 03:04:01,190
Actually, I'll just take care of it right now.

2791
03:04:03,370 --> 03:04:04,370
Let's just handle it.

2792
03:04:04,530 --> 03:04:05,370
We'll handle it.

2793
03:04:15,640 --> 03:04:16,660
I'm not even close!

2794
03:04:17,700 --> 03:04:18,660
I messed up.

2795
03:04:22,700 --> 03:04:23,860
I thought I was there!

2796
03:04:23,880 --> 03:04:25,740
I messed up.

2797
03:04:25,820 --> 03:04:26,770
I messed up.

2798
03:04:27,980 --> 03:04:28,530
I messed up.

2799
03:04:29,320 --> 03:04:30,480
Guys, I made a grave...

2800
03:04:30,480 --> 03:04:31,860
I made a grave error.

2801
03:04:34,580 --> 03:04:35,420
Let's go.

2802
03:04:36,040 --> 03:04:39,760
Okay, now I might really not make it.

2803
03:04:49,370 --> 03:04:54,150
Something about minke peeking above the bottom right corner is really scratching the right part of my brain.

2804
03:04:57,570 --> 03:04:58,110
Really?

2805
03:05:05,130 --> 03:05:05,670
Oh!

2806
03:05:05,930 --> 03:05:06,310
Whoa!

2807
03:05:07,870 --> 03:05:08,570
Tuck!

2808
03:05:13,560 --> 03:05:15,140
Throwing for cosmetics.

2809
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:16,700
I really want it.

2810
03:05:18,540 --> 03:05:19,730
I really want it!

2811
03:05:32,260 --> 03:05:33,720
Use the key!

2812
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:35,660
I will when I die!

2813
03:05:36,400 --> 03:05:38,220
You gotta...

2814
03:05:39,120 --> 03:05:41,820
You gotta pry it from my dead hands!

2815
03:05:42,980 --> 03:05:44,220
Oh no, again, again?

2816
03:05:50,590 --> 03:05:52,890
How do I get the little mint to show up and say hot dog?

2817
03:05:53,490 --> 03:05:55,430
I could say it for you right now!

2818
03:05:57,010 --> 03:05:58,250
Hat, that- uh-oh.

2819
03:06:00,790 --> 03:06:01,190
Evil.

2820
03:06:02,010 --> 03:06:07,370
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, be gone!

2821
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:19,600
Uh-oh.

2822
03:06:22,020 --> 03:06:23,660
I say it every time!

2823
03:06:23,820 --> 03:06:25,160
I'm literally like, uh-oh.

2824
03:06:25,740 --> 03:06:26,220
Uh-oh.

2825
03:06:26,920 --> 03:06:27,960
Uh-oh.

2826
03:06:30,440 --> 03:06:30,960
Again!

2827
03:06:33,060 --> 03:06:35,140
Let me die, please.

2828
03:06:35,320 --> 03:06:36,580
Put me out of my misery!

2829
03:06:44,220 --> 03:06:44,740
Again!

2830
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:49,200
I think this is a jackpot, baby.

2831
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:01,180
Again, again, again, again.

2832
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:10,360
The game heard you were trying to leave.

2833
03:07:11,020 --> 03:07:12,880
You're like, don't forget you're here forever!

2834
03:07:22,580 --> 03:07:26,680
I forgot this

2835
03:07:31,700 --> 03:07:32,360
time!

2836
03:07:36,250 --> 03:07:39,630
I remembered last time I forgot to this time!

2837
03:07:39,990 --> 03:07:40,310
I got it.

2838
03:07:40,310 --> 03:07:40,670
It's fine.

2839
03:07:40,750 --> 03:07:42,650
We're about to die, so...

2840
03:07:43,950 --> 03:07:44,610
It's fine.

2841
03:07:45,530 --> 03:07:46,770
It's fine, everybody.

2842
03:07:47,750 --> 03:07:48,890
Ew, the collector.

2843
03:07:49,530 --> 03:07:49,710
Wait.

2844
03:07:50,150 --> 03:07:53,050
Pattern multiplier plus one for every charm with a trait you have equipped.

2845
03:07:56,910 --> 03:07:57,790
That's two.

2846
03:08:37,630 --> 03:08:40,050
If you leave, you get an extra game win.

2847
03:08:40,290 --> 03:08:41,170
I know, I know.

2848
03:08:43,310 --> 03:08:44,730
The game is begging me not to win.

2849
03:08:44,830 --> 03:08:46,330
Oh my gosh, you guys, I have to go.

2850
03:08:48,210 --> 03:08:49,310
I don't have to.

2851
03:08:49,550 --> 03:08:50,510
I could go tomorrow.

2852
03:08:51,910 --> 03:08:52,610
I'll go tomorrow.

2853
03:08:53,310 --> 03:08:53,690
It's okay.

2854
03:08:54,530 --> 03:08:55,010
It's okay.

2855
03:08:57,850 --> 03:08:58,730
Double jackfight.

2856
03:08:59,450 --> 03:09:02,730
Now you want me to get the double jackpot, is that right?

2857
03:09:06,390 --> 03:09:06,870
No!

2858
03:09:10,230 --> 03:09:12,170
Now you want me to get it, huh?

2859
03:09:27,030 --> 03:09:31,550
Wait, do I have to keep it equipped for it to work?

2860
03:09:33,570 --> 03:09:35,210
Or can I put it away?

2861
03:09:39,130 --> 03:09:39,970
No, okay.

2862
03:09:51,370 --> 03:09:52,910
We can put it back.

2863
03:09:55,590 --> 03:09:55,890
Free.

2864
03:09:56,530 --> 03:09:58,210
Free to a good home.

2865
03:10:00,090 --> 03:10:00,530
Oh.

2866
03:10:02,610 --> 03:10:09,010
Guys, we might be cooked, but then we are cooked together.

2867
03:10:09,850 --> 03:10:11,110
Got to go before I do spooky.

2868
03:10:11,290 --> 03:10:13,490
4.444E1 for you.

2869
03:10:13,630 --> 03:10:14,270
Thank you.

2870
03:10:17,050 --> 03:10:18,250
Oh my gosh.

2871
03:10:18,330 --> 03:10:19,470
This is so rude.

2872
03:10:21,690 --> 03:10:23,870
This is a fun run.

2873
03:10:24,030 --> 03:10:24,670
It is fine.

2874
03:10:24,830 --> 03:10:25,770
It's definitely fine.

2875
03:10:26,430 --> 03:10:27,590
We're potentially cooked.

2876
03:10:28,230 --> 03:10:30,570
I don't think it's a potential anymore, guys.

2877
03:10:40,720 --> 03:10:43,840
I think it's the real hard truth.

2878
03:10:45,420 --> 03:10:47,720
A real falcon blues.

2879
03:10:49,560 --> 03:10:51,980
We're gonna die.

2880
03:10:55,740 --> 03:10:57,820
I will get another jackpot, though.

2881
03:10:58,640 --> 03:10:59,260
Just you wait.

2882
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:00,640
It will happen.

2883
03:11:07,190 --> 03:11:09,990
I'm learning so much of stuff like how to do this, though.

2884
03:11:10,790 --> 03:11:11,690
It's kind of awesome.

2885
03:11:14,810 --> 03:11:17,450
Of, like, different strats you guys have helped me.

2886
03:11:17,590 --> 03:11:18,310
Thank you!

2887
03:11:22,450 --> 03:11:24,610
That's exactly how I remember that song.

2888
03:11:25,410 --> 03:11:26,430
I wrote the lyrics.

2889
03:11:27,310 --> 03:11:29,990
Usually what you just heard were the original lyrics.

2890
03:11:30,430 --> 03:11:34,250
And then they said, this doesn't really fit the theme.

2891
03:11:35,130 --> 03:11:36,390
I was like, what are you talking about?

2892
03:11:36,470 --> 03:11:37,130
It's a metaphor!

2893
03:11:40,130 --> 03:11:42,230
It fits the theme, it fits the theme!

2894
03:11:42,670 --> 03:11:43,150
Jackpot!

2895
03:11:46,890 --> 03:11:48,590
Again, again, again, again!

2896
03:11:58,010 --> 03:11:59,630
Metaphor for everything!

2897
03:12:00,570 --> 03:12:04,310
Sometimes you hit jackpot and sometimes you hit jackpot and you still die.

2898
03:12:07,310 --> 03:12:09,330
It's just how it goes.

2899
03:12:12,510 --> 03:12:13,210
Evil.

2900
03:12:14,490 --> 03:12:15,250
Evil.

2901
03:12:20,490 --> 03:12:23,090
Yo-ko-kai no, I didn't realize you were into slides.

2902
03:12:24,830 --> 03:12:25,950
They're Japanese!

2903
03:12:26,470 --> 03:12:27,230
Pachinko!

2904
03:12:31,270 --> 03:12:32,870
A single six.

2905
03:12:34,050 --> 03:12:36,010
I wonder what our multipliers are at.

2906
03:12:36,170 --> 03:12:36,890
I'm crazy.

2907
03:12:37,570 --> 03:12:39,850
We get the zig, but we don't get the zag so often.

2908
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:46,540
Oh, I was like, what the hell is making that noise?

2909
03:12:48,680 --> 03:12:50,600
We gotta wait for the piss, though.

2910
03:12:51,920 --> 03:12:52,920
Oh, we are so...

2911
03:12:52,920 --> 03:12:53,700
It's so over.

2912
03:12:56,400 --> 03:12:57,700
It's so over.

2913
03:12:57,880 --> 03:12:59,680
Let's just keep going until I die.

2914
03:13:01,220 --> 03:13:02,340
Let's go, go, Billy.

2915
03:13:02,420 --> 03:13:02,620
Hoi!

2916
03:13:17,220 --> 03:13:18,540
I can't leave.

2917
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:19,640
That is true.

2918
03:13:20,060 --> 03:13:20,840
I could just leave.

2919
03:13:24,120 --> 03:13:26,740
But it's so fun watching numbers still go up, you know?

2920
03:13:34,060 --> 03:13:35,760
That's a lot of money.

2921
03:13:42,490 --> 03:13:43,630
Stay if you want to.

2922
03:13:44,710 --> 03:13:49,210
Well, maybe I like you guys, and I'm having fun, and maybe I want to hang out with you guys.

2923
03:13:50,390 --> 03:13:52,090
I don't know!

2924
03:13:54,050 --> 03:13:55,150
I don't know.

2925
03:13:55,530 --> 03:13:56,110
Maybe it's fun.

2926
03:13:58,330 --> 03:13:59,450
Getting that with you guys.

2927
03:14:00,090 --> 03:14:01,130
I'm getting jackpots.

2928
03:14:01,770 --> 03:14:04,110
I'm making number go up.

2929
03:14:04,570 --> 03:14:11,720
She likes us?

2930
03:14:14,500 --> 03:14:15,940
Yeah, I like you.

2931
03:14:21,880 --> 03:14:22,980
There, I said it.

2932
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:23,880
Are you happy now?

2933
03:14:26,460 --> 03:14:30,440
One more, one more, one more, one more!

2934
03:14:31,500 --> 03:14:32,100
Jackpot!

2935
03:14:33,820 --> 03:14:35,520
The jackpot sound is so pretty.

2936
03:14:36,940 --> 03:14:38,960
It's like addicting to listen to.

2937
03:14:43,460 --> 03:14:45,400
Do you like us more than gambling though?

2938
03:14:46,380 --> 03:14:47,980
Absolutely not!

2939
03:14:48,780 --> 03:14:49,400
Jackpot!

2940
03:14:50,440 --> 03:14:51,240
Jackpot!

2941
03:14:58,760 --> 03:14:59,380
I

2942
03:15:08,810 --> 03:15:11,510
love- Guys, we hit E!

2943
03:15:12,750 --> 03:15:13,410
Uh-oh, wait.

2944
03:15:14,730 --> 03:15:15,610
Am I stuck here?

2945
03:15:17,330 --> 03:15:19,430
No, I need to get to 2E.

2946
03:15:22,230 --> 03:15:23,770
I need to get to 2E.

2947
03:15:26,390 --> 03:15:26,810
2E!

2948
03:15:32,070 --> 03:15:33,910
You're genuinely having fun.

2949
03:15:34,350 --> 03:15:35,510
Of course I am!

2950
03:15:39,270 --> 03:15:41,290
Are you... is that bad?

2951
03:15:49,070 --> 03:15:49,850
I... what?

2952
03:15:50,030 --> 03:15:51,110
I don't know.

2953
03:15:54,230 --> 03:15:56,830
I still don't think it's gonna happen, but...

2954
03:15:57,890 --> 03:15:58,710
She's addicted.

2955
03:15:59,790 --> 03:16:02,330
But I do have a button press now, so...

2956
03:16:03,310 --> 03:16:04,770
Hard to say, honestly.

2957
03:16:05,470 --> 03:16:09,490
I'm shocked we've gotten to E with all the bones, though.

2958
03:16:10,050 --> 03:16:11,570
Like, crazy run.

2959
03:16:13,590 --> 03:16:15,130
Like, it's actually crazy.

2960
03:16:15,410 --> 03:16:16,870
I'm actually so proud of us.

2961
03:16:25,590 --> 03:16:26,150
Yata.

2962
03:16:31,840 --> 03:16:33,880
Yeah, get ready to go out the door.

2963
03:16:34,140 --> 03:16:34,820
I am.

2964
03:16:40,850 --> 03:16:41,310
Again.

2965
03:16:42,170 --> 03:16:42,710
And again.

2966
03:16:43,630 --> 03:16:44,070
And again.

2967
03:16:44,390 --> 03:16:44,790
And again.

2968
03:16:45,070 --> 03:16:45,510
And again.

2969
03:16:46,050 --> 03:16:46,930
Yata-y.

2970
03:16:47,310 --> 03:16:49,530
We have fun when you have fun.

2971
03:16:50,710 --> 03:16:51,870
I always have fun with you.

2972
03:16:51,890 --> 03:17:18,750

2974
03:17:39,330 --> 03:17:40,810
You need E13.

2975
03:17:43,570 --> 03:17:43,970
Okay.

2976
03:17:45,350 --> 03:17:45,810
E13.

2977
03:17:46,170 --> 03:17:46,310
Okay.

2978
03:17:47,290 --> 03:17:48,530
We're not in the clear, everybody.

2979
03:17:48,750 --> 03:17:49,810
We might be now, though.

2980
03:17:52,850 --> 03:17:53,570
We'll see.

2981
03:17:55,290 --> 03:17:56,330
Oh, actually, no.

2982
03:17:56,450 --> 03:17:57,330
This isn't gonna double.

2983
03:18:03,460 --> 03:18:04,960
I don't think we're in the clear.

2984
03:18:05,960 --> 03:18:06,640
No, no.

2985
03:18:07,020 --> 03:18:08,280
We're not in the clear.

2986
03:18:09,360 --> 03:18:09,680
Ooh.

2987
03:18:09,980 --> 03:18:10,520
Nothing.

2988
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:11,580
It's hairy.

2989
03:18:19,050 --> 03:18:21,470
We are possibly cooked.

2990
03:18:22,630 --> 03:18:26,210
I think there's still one round though after this.

2991
03:18:33,860 --> 03:18:34,620
Oh!

2992
03:18:35,440 --> 03:18:36,000
Never mind.

2993
03:18:36,180 --> 03:18:37,220
There was no rounds left.

2994
03:18:38,100 --> 03:18:38,400
Bye!

2995
03:18:39,800 --> 03:18:41,000
Are you really ready?

2996
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:46,800
You are out.

2997
03:18:48,940 --> 03:18:49,940
Don't close the game.

2998
03:18:51,580 --> 03:18:52,100
Okay.

2999
03:18:57,400 --> 03:18:58,840
Do I press anything?

3000
03:19:00,420 --> 03:19:01,500
What do I do?

3001
03:19:09,280 --> 03:19:10,120
Click.

3002
03:19:14,090 --> 03:19:14,490
Whoa!

3003
03:19:21,070 --> 03:19:22,250
What is this?

3004
03:19:23,150 --> 03:19:23,450
Whoa!

3005
03:19:27,940 --> 03:19:28,360
Zero.

3006
03:19:32,590 --> 03:19:32,770
Whoa!

3007
03:19:33,330 --> 03:19:34,730
There's more over there.

3008
03:19:37,270 --> 03:19:37,650
Three.

3009
03:19:48,910 --> 03:19:49,990
Let's go gambling!

3010
03:19:50,250 --> 03:19:51,270

Doesn't matter if I was gonna die!

3018

It's okay to have setbacks.

3031
03:21:29,490 --> 03:21:30,770
It's okay to fall.

3032
03:21:34,070 --> 03:21:34,910
That's it.

3033
03:21:37,190 --> 03:21:38,530
Get out of the room.

3034
03:21:45,670 --> 03:21:47,470
Oh, yippee!

3035
03:21:50,760 --> 03:21:52,580
I wanted the golden knob.

3036
03:21:53,440 --> 03:21:55,320
I don't know.

3037
03:21:55,440 --> 03:21:56,720
I knew you would have...

3038
03:21:56,720 --> 03:21:58,300
I knew you would come back.

3039
03:21:58,500 --> 03:22:00,440
It looks like we really aren't done with you then.

3040
03:22:01,920 --> 03:22:03,440
I got a golden nose.

3041
03:22:03,560 --> 03:22:04,420
Oh, I got eyeballs.

3042
03:22:05,060 --> 03:22:06,940

Peridore.

3054
03:22:26,180 --> 03:22:28,860
Oh, isn't that like the fear of...

3055
03:22:28,860 --> 03:22:29,780
Or it's like something...

3056
03:22:29,780 --> 03:22:31,080
They're always watching you?

3057
03:22:31,940 --> 03:22:32,380
Depression!

3058
03:22:33,480 --> 03:22:34,560

3059
03:22:35,160 --> 03:22:36,440

Diesel locomotive?

3061
03:22:38,720 --> 03:22:40,080
Steam locomotive.

3062
03:22:40,900 --> 03:22:42,460
Oh, that's the seeing faces!

3063
03:22:42,780 --> 03:22:43,680
That's right, that's right.

3064
03:22:44,440 --> 03:22:45,280
Potato battery.

3065
03:22:45,860 --> 03:22:46,760
Music tape.

3066
03:22:48,320 --> 03:22:50,480
Immediately gain one extra round for this deadline.

3067
03:22:50,760 --> 03:22:51,180
Huge.

3068
03:22:52,920 --> 03:22:54,900
Whenever two spins...

3069
03:22:55,580 --> 03:22:57,100
Well, these are all from opening the door.

3070
03:22:57,340 --> 03:22:59,420
Whenever two spins in a row have no reward, recharge.

3071
03:22:59,900 --> 03:23:00,880
Okay, that's nice.

3072
03:23:01,760 --> 03:23:05,100
Increase all symbols by their base value permanently if the previous three spins had no reward.

3073
03:23:06,760 --> 03:23:09,800
Increase all patterns by their base value permanently if the previous three spins had no reward.

3074
03:23:10,400 --> 03:23:10,680
Okay.

3075
03:23:11,400 --> 03:23:13,040
The slot machine loses its spark.

3076
03:23:13,360 --> 03:23:16,520
Spontaneous luck at the slot machine is flattened to zero.

3077
03:23:17,460 --> 03:23:19,520
Lucky charms can still grant luck.

3078
03:23:20,380 --> 03:23:20,860
I...

3079
03:23:20,860 --> 03:23:21,160
Huh?

3080
03:23:21,340 --> 03:23:22,280
I don't understand?

3081
03:23:24,940 --> 03:23:25,420
Okay.

3082
03:23:25,440 --> 03:23:31,940
Whenever you see the eye and no other patterns during a spin, double the value of all patterns permanently.

3083
03:23:33,320 --> 03:23:39,720
For every three consecutive spins where you score either our diamonds, treasures, or sevens, you'll have the eye pattern.

3084
03:23:42,400 --> 03:23:44,960
I don't understand this one at all.

3085
03:23:51,090 --> 03:23:51,650
Interesting.

3086
03:23:54,050 --> 03:23:56,430
Depression build is the new meta somehow.

3087
03:23:57,430 --> 03:23:58,630
But thank you guys!

3088
03:23:59,110 --> 03:24:09,330

3089
03:24:12,650 --> 03:24:29,730

3090
03:24:29,930 --> 03:24:32,090
I'm tired of holding myself down.

3091
03:24:34,810 --> 03:24:36,330
Update us if you try.

3092
03:24:36,550 --> 03:24:37,370
Oh yeah, I will.

3093
03:24:37,510 --> 03:24:38,670
Or we could try on stream.

3094
03:24:40,610 --> 03:24:41,550
Alright, Princess.

3095
03:24:41,850 --> 03:24:42,590
Thank you!

3096
03:24:43,150 --> 03:24:44,230
Thank you guys.

3097
03:24:44,630 --> 03:24:45,970
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3098
03:24:46,170 --> 03:24:47,250
Thanks for hanging out with us.

3099
03:24:47,290 --> 03:24:49,610
No, thank you for hanging out with me.

3100
03:24:50,970 --> 03:24:54,010
As they say, thank you to everybody who played.

3101
03:24:54,170 --> 03:24:55,670
And to- wait, no.

3102
03:24:55,890 --> 03:24:56,310
Thank you.

3103
03:24:56,730 --> 03:24:58,750
Thank you to everybody who made the game.

3104
03:24:59,330 --> 03:25:02,370
And also, to players like you.

3105
03:25:03,050 --> 03:25:05,190
I'm looking directly at you right now.

3106
03:25:07,010 --> 03:25:08,190
Oh, you're looking good today.

3107
03:25:08,610 --> 03:25:09,050
Wow.

3108
03:25:09,290 --> 03:25:09,810
Oh my gosh.

3109
03:25:09,930 --> 03:25:10,210
Wait.

3110
03:25:10,910 --> 03:25:14,570
You're looking- I'm getting embarrassed looking at you.

3111
03:25:14,730 --> 03:25:15,430
Oh my gosh.

3112
03:25:17,050 --> 03:25:17,570
Wow.

3113
03:25:17,570 --> 03:25:19,030
You look so good.

3114
03:25:19,610 --> 03:25:20,490
Oh, wow.

3115
03:25:21,290 --> 03:25:23,250
Well, oh my gosh.

3116
03:25:23,470 --> 03:25:26,670
I'm gonna go- Oh my god!

3117
03:25:27,790 --> 03:25:28,290
Hi!

3118
03:25:28,770 --> 03:25:30,170
Okay, well I'm gonna go...

3119
03:25:30,910 --> 03:25:32,410
Yeah, it's you, Mimi.

3120
03:25:35,890 --> 03:25:36,970
It's you, Mimi.

3121
03:25:38,170 --> 03:25:40,170
I'm gonna go...

3122
03:25:41,030 --> 03:25:42,170
But like...

3123
03:25:43,250 --> 03:25:43,910
Don't change.

3124
03:25:45,230 --> 03:25:45,710
Bye bye!

3125
03:25:45,910 --> 03:25:46,750
Otomi-bye!

3126
03:25:46,750 --> 03:25:47,430
Bye-bye!

3127
03:25:48,990 --> 03:25:50,110
Bye-bye!
