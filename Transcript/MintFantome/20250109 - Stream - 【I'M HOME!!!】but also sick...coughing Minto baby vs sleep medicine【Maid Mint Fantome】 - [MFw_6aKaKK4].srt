1
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,240
There we go.

2
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,520
Welcome back, Master and Ma'am!

3
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,740
Hello!

4
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,080
Hello!

5
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,820
Hello, hello.

6
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,100
I'm supposed to be tired, but thank you for doing the live.

7
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,800
No, no, no.

8
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,480
Hello!

10
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,220
Hello!

11
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,720
Hello, everybody.

12
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,780
I sound maybe a little bit better today.

13
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,880
Maybe.

14
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,720
Maybe.

15
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,320
Maybe I sound a little bit better.

16
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,320
I think.

17
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,720
Sick.

18
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,980
Sick.

19
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,520
Sick.

20
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,740
Sick.

21
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,880
Hello.

22
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,940
Did I sound much better than yesterday?

23
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:24,660
Yeah!

24
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,060
Yippee!

25
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,260
Sick.

26
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,880
Sick in the head.

27
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,500
Sick in the mind.

28
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,180
Sick in the spirit.

29
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,440
You guys sick in the body.

30
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,420
Probably.

31
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:39,500
Probably.

32
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,920
Thank you again for singing Happy Birthday for my daughter.

33
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,900
I'll put a recording of it.

34
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,080
Sorry, I don't usually do like the...

35
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,260
Wait.

36
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,240
Wait, hold on.

37
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,400
My head is messed up.

38
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,340
Wait, hold on.

39
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,460
Not just my head being messed up.

40
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Hold on.

41
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,560
I'm actually messed up.

42
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,580
There we go.

43
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,900
I'm messed up in the head.

44
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,160
I'm not used to... I don't usually do like the interchanging BGM, so it threw me off.

45
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,140
But yeah, of course.

46
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,420
Actually, I have some birthdays that I missed yesterday.

47
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,220
Since I was doing the stream.

48
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:48,880
Good morning.

49
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,940
Good morning!

50
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,980
Chi Papa, I don't understand the reference.

51
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,040
I have not played the Monster Girl Quest with Paradox, the new one.

52
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,200
So, I don't understand.

53
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,940
I saw someone super chat earlier.

54
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,540
They were like, return to Hora Hora.

55
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,660
My friend's toddler is watching.

56
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,800
She loves you so much.

57
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,340
Can you say...

58
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,900
Hi Riley!

59
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,300
Hello, hello!

60
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,280
Hi Riley, hi!

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
I like how so much of the pre-chat became talking about Monster Girl Quest.

62
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,380
Just all because of my thumbnail.

63
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,700
That's so funny.

64
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,340
It really became like such a conversation.

65
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,880
Hi Jack!

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,740
Oh coughing medicated Minto baby, can you give us your best coughing baby impression?

67
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,020
Welcome back for real for real Minto.

68
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:49,920
Okay.

69
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,690
Best coughing baby impression.

70
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,990
And you have to get like the...

71
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,330
You have to do like the mouth, you know.

72
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,230
Chi Papa is from the OG game, that's what Sylph says.

73
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,590
Oh, I don't remember.

74
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,470
Oh my gosh.

75
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,950
Okay, wait.

76
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,210
We're gonna talk Monster Girl Quest in a minute, okay?

77
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,170
We're gonna talk it in a minute.

78
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,450
Okay, hold on.

79
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,890
Okay.

80
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,750
That's my coughing baby.

81
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,590
That's not me actually coughing, but...

82
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,380
You know how like babies, like when they...

83
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,400
They're like...

84
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,180
They like...

85
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,600
They like release it from their soul.

86
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,420
They release it from their soul.

87
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,540
That's me actually coughing.

88
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,500
Oh gosh.

89
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,460
Minto, you're all soul.

90
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,060
I know!

91
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,000
I know.

92
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:22,910
But...

93
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,090
Yeah, Monster Girl Quest.

94
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,970
Okay, it's been a really long time...

95
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,390
Since I've played Monster Girl Quest.

96
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,590
Minto Doki came in today.

97
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:33,830
Yippee!

98
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,750
Thank you.

99
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,810
I honestly wanna play it on stream.

100
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,990
Because it's been so long.

101
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,590
And I also have not played Chapter 3.

102
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,970
So I'm like...

103
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,310
Because when I played it, Chapter 3 was not out yet.

104
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,970
So I'm just like...

105
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,250
I've been...

106
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,310
Is there a stream friendly version?

107
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,170
No.

108
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,050
But...

109
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,010
But...

110
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,170
I have...

111
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,170
I have...

112
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,790
I looked at the game earlier.

113
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,850
And...

114
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,390
I can export all of the CGs from it.

115
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,770
Like all of the images from it.

116
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,790
And if I manually censor...

117
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,790
Each and every single one...

118
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,590
If I manually censor each and every single one...

119
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,790
And then re-import it...

120
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,790
Into the game...

121
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,530
lol I think...

122
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,910
I think I could do it.

123
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,050
Probably.

124
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,670
Everybody is playing HuniePop right now.

125
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,270
So I'm just like...

126
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,690
What's the difference, you know?

127
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,790
Don't miss any.

128
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,450
I know, right?

129
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,370
That would be terrifying.

130
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,550
That's dedication.

131
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,990
Yeah, but I really wanna play.

132
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,510
I've been talking about playing Chapter 3 for so long.

133
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,650
And honestly, it's just kind of...

134
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,670
Thanks for the art.

135
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,130
Thanks for the 5%!

136
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,870
If I...

137
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,750
If I...

138
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,710
I have to get back...

139
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,510
It's been so long since I've played the first two.

140
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,810
So I would have to play those.

141
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,510
I remember the story.

142
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,090
But I don't remember like specific parts of it.

143
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,670
You know what I mean?

144
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,010
And...

145
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,790
lol What about spoilers?

146
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,730
I guess I would have to get someone to help me with part 3.

147
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,190
Probably.

148
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,270
But I've played 1 and 2.

149
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,430
So I totally...

150
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,950
You know, I'm not...

151
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,450
I'd be fine, I think.

152
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,570
Ew, drippy nose.

153
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,430
I'm like that Pokemon.

154
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,190
The one that you want to beat up.

155
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,190
I always want to beat up that nasty little bear.

156
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,870
Lunch for Tissue.

157
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,570
Thank you.

158
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,190
Cup Chew.

159
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,390
I'm thirsty, let me drink from that.

161
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,150
I'm not gonna read that.

162
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,410
Mr. Kaigai, happy birthday!

163
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,230
Kaigai Nikki.

164
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,330
Happy birthday to you.

165
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,830
Happy birthday to you.

166
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,570
Happy birthday, Mr. Kaigai Nikki.

167
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,010
Happy birthday to you.

168
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,130
Wait.

169
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,270
Wait, I have two more from yesterday.

170
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,770
But I couldn't sing.

171
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,210
So these are two from yesterday.

172
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,030
One more time!

173
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,590
Happy birthday to you.

174
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,030
Happy birthday to you.

175
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,690
Happy birthday, Dice Bag Games.

176
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,250
Happy birthday to you.

177
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,570
One more time!

178
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,850
Happy birthday to you.

179
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,130
Happy birthday to you.

180
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,890
Happy birthday, Koyuki.

181
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,290
Happy birthday to you.

182
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,690
Okay, I think I'm caught up.

183
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,790
I wrote this down earlier, because I saw them yesterday.

184
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,310
But I was doing sponsor streams, so I was like...

185
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,550
I can't just interrupt the stream for it.

186
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,410
So sorry, that's a little late.

187
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,750
I just started my adventuring in Tokyo in order to get your BGM.

188
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:03,670
Hope you feel better.

189
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,530
Thank you!

190
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,330
Thank you, thank you.

191
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,870
I'm sick too, sisters.

192
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,170
Sicky sisters.

193
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,690
Can you tell us about your comic yet?

194
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,510
Yeah, I have a lot I want to talk about.

195
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,170
I wrote things down so I wouldn't forget.

196
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,630
Will you play Rance 2?

197
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,810
Was this the beginning of my Edoge arc on my stream?

198
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,190
On my channel?

199
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,730
I don't think I can get away with...

200
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,290
I wonder what's the limit I can get away with.

201
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,170
Thank you for the 50 gifts!

202
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,930
Thank you!

203
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,070
Thank you so much!

204
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,630
Hi!

205
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,590
Oh gosh.

206
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,430
Sorry, I didn't take all of the sleepy time medicine.

207
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,190
So I only took half.

208
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,530
Because it tasted bad.

209
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,510
But...

210
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,410
Just ask Kei-san.

211
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,130
Hey, she's on Twitch.

212
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,550
I don't do Twitch here.

213
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,290
She got banned.

214
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:30,950
Yeah, I know.

215
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,830
On Twitch.

216
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,230
On Twitch.

217
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,430
That's what I'm saying.

218
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,650
She got banned on Twitch.

219
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,230
She didn't get banned on YouTube.

220
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,390
But I'm wondering, like, for some of the HCNs...

221
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:46,730
If...

222
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,230
Thank you for the 50 gifts!

223
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,350
Thank you!

224
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,650
If I would get in trouble for, like, the sounds.

225
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,170
If I would think it's like an ASMR, you know.

226
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,230
You know how some people get age...

227
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,130
Age restricted because of Kei...

228
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,710
Sorry, I read Kei-san.

229
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,490
Not Kei-san.

230
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,350
Because of ASMR...

231
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,730
Streams, even though the ASMR is, like, fine.

232
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,700
Thank you for the 2747 karaoke stream.

233
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,760
That made my cross-country holiday excursion more fun.

234
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,520
Sorry, you probably had to hear repeats, though.

235
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,880
But I'm glad you liked it.

236
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,500
Thank you.

237
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,920
Happy New Year, Kero-san.

238
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,700
Thank you!

239
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,520
Now, so...

240
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,880
Recovering from COVID.

241
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,340
No!

242
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,360
Looking forward to the Eroge arc.

243
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,560
We'll see, though.

244
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,240
We can try...

245
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,820
You watch a VTuber play with all the sussy sounds intact?

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Still up?

247
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,460
Not sure if monetized.

248
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,160
I don't really care about the monetization, I'll be honest.

249
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,280
As long as I don't get, like, my YouTube...

250
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,960
Whatever partnership, I guess, is what it's called, taken away.

251
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,700
But I don't mind if, like, a stream gets demonetized.

252
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,620
I don't know.

253
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,080
But we'll see.

254
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,140
Maybe we'll run with, like, the first game.

255
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,760
And then see from there.

256
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,180
I know that Monster Girl.

257
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,660
But I've been a big fan of Monster Girl Quest for a long time, for those who don't know.

258
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,760
Someone asked earlier what my favorite Monster Girl is.

259
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,940
I mean, it's probably basic, but I do love Alice a whole lot.

260
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,960
Like, she is peak design for me.

261
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,960
And it's been a long time since I played, so it's kind of hard for me to say...

262
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,100
From who I remember.

263
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,520
Of course I remember, like, Touch Fluffy Tail and all that.

264
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,740
Actually...

265
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,220
Before Matara debuted in Bishoujo...

266
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,960
I was the one who was just like...

267
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,460
Hey, girl.

268
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,280
You should contact Kenko Cross.

269
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,880
That was me.

270
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,880
I was like, if you want, you know...

271
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,860
If you want peak design, just ask.

272
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,160
I love Monster Girl.

273
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,480
Very much.

274
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,880
I have, like...

275
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,760
Actually, do I?

276
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,980
I don't know if I'm current current.

277
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,080
I have Mangos 1 through 17 of Monster Musume.

278
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,060
Is that current current?

279
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,200
I don't collect Mango very much, but...

280
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,010
When I do...

281
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,010
18 just came out.

282
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,810
I have to pick it up.

283
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:25,730
Yeah.

284
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,570
Yeah.

285
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,650
I'm struggling not to say something unwise about the thumbnail art today.

286
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,690
It's okay.

287
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,090
It made me feel unwise too.

288
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,550
So maybe one day... Maybe one day...

289
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,490
I was just like, oh man, if I could, like...

290
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,310
Censor them really quickly, the pictures.

291
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,750
I was like, I'll play it next week, but...

292
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,710
I...

293
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,030
Don't think I can in time.

294
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,590
It might be a while.

295
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,450
Wow, Jay, thanks for the peak!

296
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,530
Hope you get well soon, but stay freaky.

297
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,290
Thank you!

298
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,190
Oh yeah, Ashes, I saw your dono earlier.

299
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,070
Sorry, I was talking.

300
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,590
Mint vs the Hat Man.

301
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,710
Who would win?

302
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,150
Betting on the Hat Man.

303
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,790
Who is the Hat Man?

304
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,100
Hat Man.

305
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,050
She doesn't know.

306
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,130
Huh?

307
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,690
Hat Man is a Benadryl hallucination.

308
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,570
What?

309
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,390
I'm on the TL team.

310
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,610
Do you want me to whip you up a mild censor for...

311
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:49,850
No!

312
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,870
Wait, what?

313
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,770
No way!

314
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,710
Of like...

315
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,410
Original Monster Girl Quest?

316
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,450
No, it's okay though.

317
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,190
I don't want you to go through that trouble though.

318
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,190
It's okay.

319
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:08,930
Is she sick?

320
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,550
I'm sick in the head.

321
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,950
Dona Dona has an NSFW toggle for sayings and vowels.

322
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,790
No way!

323
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,530
I didn't know that.

324
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,510
Why would you turn it off?

325
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,970
Why?

326
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,370
Why would you turn it off?

327
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,310
Reminded me.

328
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,890
Reminded you of me.

329
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,350
Sick freaks.

330
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,490
For the story.

331
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,350
Okay though, but with Monster Girl Quest...

332
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,470
I kind of want to play it because like...

333
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,810
Like on stream rather is because...

334
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:58,570
Because...

335
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,710
Sorry.

336
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,310
Oh god.

337
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,750
Is because the story is actually so good.

338
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,570
It's literally one of those things.

339
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,750
I came for the plot and I stayed for the plot.

340
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,910
Type of...

341
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,030
Type of stories.

342
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:15,730
You know what I mean?

343
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,970
It's actually so good.

344
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:20,670
Like...

345
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,570
Like unironically, it's so so good.

346
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,190
Favorite interspecies reviewers character.

347
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,410
Oh, I only watched a couple episodes of that.

348
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,650
Because I was actually watching it on...

349
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,470
Oh gosh, I don't remember what...

350
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,810
Platform it was on.

351
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,930
I don't have that anymore.

352
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,070
HiDive or whatever.

353
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,450
And then they took it off because they're stupid.

354
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,070
Funimation?

355
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:53,910
Was it Funimation?

356
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,110
It was so disappointing.

357
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,390
So I never actually finished it.

358
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:06,970
Because I sometimes get lazy when it comes to finding other ways.

359
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,630
It was just a couple episodes that I watched.

360
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,150
It was good though.

361
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,230
It was good from what I watched, yeah.

362
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,630
Couldn't handle the freak.

363
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,030
So sad.

364
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,090
So sad.

365
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,210
But I'll finish it someday.

366
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,210
I'll finish it someday.

367
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,270
Show was peak.

368
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,090
What about for Paradox?

369
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,210
I want to finish the original story first though.

370
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,230
I think.

371
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,410
Before I go into Paradox.

372
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,770
Since Paradox is...

373
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,490
It's like...

374
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,730
From what I understand, it's an alt story but also the gameplay is different too, right?

375
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,610
It's a side project.

376
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,870
No, it's okay.

377
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,810
Don't worry about it.

378
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:14,370
Thank you though.

379
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,370
I really appreciate it.

380
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,750
Paradox is very long.

381
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,370
Is it now?

382
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,450
Finish the original first Paradox.

383
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,770
Might spoil the early one.

384
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:34,050
I gotta finish all the stuff with the angels in the third chapter.

385
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,610
TL site sponsor win.

386
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,050
lol

387
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,170
What the heck?

388
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,670
Why are there so many translator team people here?

389
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,690
I want to...

390
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,310
Like I said, it's been so long since I played it.

391
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,610
That I...

392
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,890
That I want to...

393
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,350
Want to go back through it for the first two games.

394
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,450
Freaks assemble.

395
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,390
Freaks assemble.

396
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,050
I guess the thumbnail really did wonders, huh?

397
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,610
The thumbnail really...

398
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,430
It was not clickbait.

399
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,010
We're talking about Monster Girl Quest.

400
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,950
Maybe I should have saved it for when I stream Monster Girl Quest.

401
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,230
lol

402
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,910
Reporting for duty.

403
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,970
Did you draw the thumbnail?

404
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,150
No, no, no.

405
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,970
The thumbnail artist is in the description.

406
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,090
MapleSides.

407
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,510
Thumbnail game too strong.

408
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,670
Should I get that as an outfit?

409
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,070
YouTube would really hate me, I think.

410
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,630
Maybe.

411
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,490
Sometimes they're like that with...

412
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,190
With...

413
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,890
Too much skin.

414
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,110
If I were blue, maybe it'd be okay.

415
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,660
Did the artist know or is it Quinten?

416
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,180
I've talked about liking Monster Girl Quest before.

417
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,740
And it's Hero of the Snake.

418
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,900
It's perfect.

419
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,320
Perfect.

420
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,820
I actually did a game review speech in high school on...

421
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,040
Wait.

422
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,320
I did a game review speech in high school.

423
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,790
Paradox is indeed a full sequel.

424
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,490
In high school.

425
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,290
I'm pretty sure that's when I played it too.

426
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,090
It's our secret.

427
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,580
Monster and ghost girls are indeed the best.

428
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,640
Technically, I am a monster girl.

429
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,680
I'm in the Monster Girl encyclopedia.

430
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,680
Logan, thank you for the 10 gift.

431
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,520
Thank you.

432
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,980
Guys, I think I'm really weak.

433
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,840
I already feel my head getting so dizzy.

434
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,980
I'm gonna google the hat, man.

435
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,500
I'm scared.

436
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,760
Hat, man.

437
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,020
Scary.

438
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,280
Does he look like the guy from Curious George?

439
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,400
Don't push yourself.

440
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,300
I'm all good.

441
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,420
Don't worry.

442
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,060
Don't worry.

443
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,420
I just didn't think it would hit so fast.

444
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,660
Actually, I might go get some dinner.

445
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,140
Pretty good.

446
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,620
Thank you for the aqua soup.

447
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,060
Welcome back, Mito.

448
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,740
And congrats on this great Touhou cover.

449
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,020
Thank you.

450
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
I really, really appreciate it.

451
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,320
Thank you.

452
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,580
Thank you.

453
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,200
Thank you.

454
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,180
For only three 570 energy drinks.

455
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,420
From 2026.

456
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,730
I didn't have dinner yet, but easy.

457
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,550
I will.

458
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:57,790
Don't worry.

459
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,930
I went and bought some pre-made sushi.

460
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,970
Why would you take sleep medicine and not sleep?

461
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,190
Well, I didn't sleep so much last night because of the jet lag.

462
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,070
And I was like, I gotta force myself today.

463
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,310
I'll give you a small tip on stream lives, Mito.

464
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,410
Love your singing.

465
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,230
Congrats on the collab.

466
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,350
Thank you.

467
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,150
Good playlist.

468
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,230
Thank you for the aqua soup.

469
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,230
But why would you...

470
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,390
Why would you send...

471
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,330
Stream lives, sorry.

472
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,350
I think it's backed up because of some of the gifting.

473
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,230
But why would you send...

474
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,730
Why would you send stream lives?

475
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:38,130
Don't know.

476
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,310
And then aqua... Don't know.

477
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:40,890
Stop it.

478
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,860
It's small.

479
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,200
What do you mean by that?

480
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,220
Hold on.

481
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,820
I'm gonna go look prematurely.

482
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm gonna look at the ones that haven't come through yet.

483
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,020
They have a titanium.

484
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,680
Thank you.

485
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,920
Mito's back.

486
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,400
Yippee.

487
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,400
I just discovered a new face I can make, you guys.

488
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,180
Look at this.

489
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,200
I got sick the same time as you.

490
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,980
I think you haunted me.

491
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,940
I might have.

492
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,940
I'm really sorry.

493
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,500
Don't worry, man.

494
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,620
I'll take sleep meds and we'll fight the hat man so you can sleep in peace.

495
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,120
Please fight the hat man for me.

496
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,040
My mouth is so small!

497
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,490
Did you guys watch the cover?

498
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,250
Did you guys listen to it?

499
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,430
I'm actually so...

500
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,790
I'm actually so...

501
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:22,930
Uh...

502
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,150
Uh, what's the word?

503
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,870
Self-conscious of it.

504
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,810
It was awesome.

505
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,110
Today at work, too.

506
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,870
Oh, there it is.

507
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,650
I think they're coming through now.

508
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,090
You should put it on Spotify.

509
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,010
I don't think that's up to me, though.

510
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,570
I think that's up to them.

511
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,410
Listen to the cover on repeat for an hour while shoveling snow.

512
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,810
You're gonna get sick of it if you do it like that.

513
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,610
I heard you're sick with strong.

514
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,770
Let me fight it.

515
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,590
The only cover I know is your one of Santa Baby.

516
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,270
So many people have been talking about the Santa Baby.

517
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,090
Santa Baby.

518
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,150
We...

519
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,330
Shoveled snow yesterday, got a cold.

520
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:19,730
No!

521
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,910
Everybody's getting sick, huh?

522
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:25,950
Everybody, huh?

523
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,650
Trying to be healthier for 2025.

524
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,690
And the cover is perfect for running PGM.

525
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,730
Oh, let's go.

526
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,590
Didn't miss the...

527
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,810
Transformers 1 discussion.

528
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:39,210
No!

529
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,710
Guys, we...

530
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:40,930
Okay.

531
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,570
ViviCore, thank you so much.

532
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,430
I get to thank you.

533
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,930
You guys didn't tell me that Transformers 1 was...

534
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,130
Was animated.

535
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,210
I thought it was gonna be...

536
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,030
Like, I think actually Michael Bay produced it.

537
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,990
But I didn't realize that it was going to be...

538
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:05,070
I thought it was going to be like a live action, you know, like another one of those.

539
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,070
Is it animated?

540
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,170
Yes!

541
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,990
And it's so good!

542
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,770
It's so good!

543
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,930
I thought it was going to be like Michael Bay's slop, you know, but...

544
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,910
What's the Santa, baby?

545
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,570
He was like, you're so cute.

546
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,170
Thank you.

547
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,240
I'm pretty sure though...

548
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,900
Pretty sure Michael Bay helped produce this one.

549
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,480
And then also Steven Spielberg.

550
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,980
And also...

551
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,520
Rise up!

552
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,580
Sorry, I didn't tell you.

553
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,200
I failed you.

554
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:49,960
It's okay.

555
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,400
I didn't watch any trailers or anything, so I guess it's on me too.

556
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,860
The part that sucks though is that it was advertised like it was a kid's film.

557
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,400
I...

558
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,660
See it.

559
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,760
Why it, like, would be advertised that way.

560
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,500
It's very...

561
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,480
I think it's like one of those types of movies that's like all ages.

562
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,260
You know what I mean?

563
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,920
Anyone can enjoy it.

564
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,960
Badassatron.

565
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,160
Badassatron.

566
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,680
I...

567
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,920
But because Megatron...

568
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,940
Because they kept calling him D...

569
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,120
In my brain, I kept calling him DD Megadoodoo.

570
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,240
Because, you know, Megatron.

571
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,840
But I was like, oh, DD Megadoodoo.

572
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,580
You guys know that video.

573
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,580
You guys know that clip of like the...

574
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,580
It's like a...

575
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:51,960
No?

576
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,120
Okay, hold on.

577
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,020
Let me pull it up.

578
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,040
Hold on, let me pull it up.

579
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,340
It's super duper short.

580
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,280
DD Megadoodoo.

581
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,100
DD Megadoodoo.

582
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,420
It's like the shortest thing ever.

583
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,840
Okay, hold on.

584
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,280
Hold on.

585
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,440
Hold on.

586
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,280
Hold on.

587
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,600
DD Megadoodoo.

588
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,820
Did you see both end credit scenes?

589
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:28,860
I...

590
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,660
I saw the one of like the Decepticons.

591
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,520
And I saw the one where B...

592
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,800
Kills his friend or whatever.

593
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,660
Both of them.

594
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,440
Is that the ones you're talking about?

595
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,100
Like, come on man, Happy New Year.

596
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,160
Happy New Year!

597
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,580
Okay, hold on.

598
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,360
Let's watch DD Megadoodoo real quick.

599
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,840
Real quick, real quick.

600
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,660
Oh, sorry.

601
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,800
I cropped it kind of weird.

602
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,700
But that's fine.

603
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,000
I'll just crop it on this side too.

604
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,760
There we go.

605
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,260
Okay, DD Megadoodoo.

606
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,190
Oh my god, I just realized this.

607
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,250
I was like, wow, this BGM is going for so long.

608
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,230
It's because it's a two hour version.

609
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,470
When the hell did I download that?

610
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,970
Okay.

611
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:30,290
Final goodbyes to this fallen Louisville police officer.

612
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,230
DD Megadoodoo.

613
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,730
I'm sorry.

614
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,620
Mangudoo.

615
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,360
Final goodbyes to this fallen Louisville police officer.

616
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,000
DD Megadoodoo.

617
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,840
I'm sorry.

618
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,960
Mangudoo.

619
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,580
It's so messed up.

620
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,620
DD Megadoodoo.

621
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,400
I'm sorry.

622
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,340
It's so bad.

623
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:30,810
I don't envy being a newscaster like that at all.

624
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,570
I think I would be like...

625
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:37,210
You know how I mispronounce stuff all the time already.

626
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,570
Where I say things wrong or...

627
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,170
I type things weird.

628
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,530
316 is actually a reference to Megatron's original toy in the Takara Transformers line.

629
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,990
It was his collection number.

630
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,110
No way, I had no idea about that.

631
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,190
Transformers 1 mention.

632
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,210
Must send money.

633
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,150
Seriously, the story I've been wanting to see.

634
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,410
Animated for years.

635
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,390
And the fact that it got slipped on kills me.

636
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,390
It was a love letter to the franchise I love.

637
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,150
Glad my Kamiya-shi liked it.

638
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,070
I loved it.

639
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:10,790
It was so good.

640
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,470
DD Megadoodoo.

641
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,470
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

642
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,810
It was just so good.

643
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,830
Did you see Nosferatu yet?

644
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,870
No, I haven't seen that one actually.

645
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,930
Most of the things that I knew...

646
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,370
Well, I didn't know anything about Transformers 1.

647
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,510
But anything that I knew about it...

648
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,130
About it being a good movie...

649
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,470
Was from that one Transformers hype guy on Twitter.

650
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:55,890
So...

651
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,850
I...

652
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,130
Wearing TF shirt and mintos and all these...

653
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,070
I'm talking about TF1.

654
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,730
I want to see Nosferatu though.

655
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,510
I heard that he's uncircumcised.

656
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,430
Is that true?

657
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,310
No.

658
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,070
Oh, I saw also that with the...

659
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,830
Yes, actually.

660
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,930
I saw that also for Transformers.

661
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,190
That...

662
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,210
That...

663
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,230
Lucasfilms also helped with the animation.

664
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:48,730
Craziness.

665
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,970
And then there's like Scarlett Johansson.

666
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,010
Johansson?

667
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,470
Scarlett Jo...

668
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,230
Jo-mama?

669
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,330
What's her name?

670
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,910
She's in it too.

671
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,290
I meant to hope you had a good day.

672
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,050
I heard you got sick so...

673
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,190
Also happy 30th Ace Combat Anniversary New Year.

674
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,510
Happy 30th Ace Combat Anniversary New Year.

675
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,250
Sorry you're under the weather.

676
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,730
Here's hoping your cold is as short as...

677
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,390
Stop!

678
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,990
I had it right?

679
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,090
Scarlett Megadoodoo.

680
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,290
Does the new Linkin Park singer transform...

681
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:32,790
Wait, what?

682
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,570
Trash Dracula.

683
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,090
Yeah, Scarlett voices Elita Wan.

684
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,250
I'll forever say Scarlett Jo-mama from now on.

685
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,710
Scar...

686
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:52,770
Scarlett Megadoodoo.

687
00:39:55,050 --> 00:40:00,590
Hypothetically, if I did a Gingerbread Minto cosplay in the style of Phantom of the Opera...

688
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,350
What has gotten you on your Phantom of the Opera kick?

689
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:11,390
What hypothetical color scheme for a three-piece men's suit would Mint hypothetically recommend?

690
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,590
It has to be mint though, right?

691
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,470
Mint and gold.

692
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,870
Brown highlights?

693
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:20,530
I don't know.

694
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,170
Get creative with it.

695
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,730
Welcome back, Mint.

696
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,870
Resident Lurker here.

697
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,590
There's a lot I want to say about...

698
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,270
Oh.

699
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,250
Good playlist.

700
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,370
Oh my god!

701
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,430
That's way too much, please.

702
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,630
Thank you.

703
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,520
Thank you so much.

704
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,860
Holy moly, no, it's way too much though.

705
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,080
Puskai, Kazem, thank you so much for the first ever Super Chat.

706
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,980
Good luck with... Oh wait, I was going to say good luck with college, but you graduated!

707
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,700
Congrats!

708
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,180
I always wondered, but never asked.

709
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,420
Do you have control on the character limit on membership supers?

710
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,700
They only get 50, not sure if on purpose.

711
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,200
I don't think I have control over that.

712
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,580
If I do, I've never seen a way to change it.

713
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,760
Oh, thanks for the...

714
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,000
Thank you.

715
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,900
I have lots of fun in Japan.

716
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,120
I have Japan stories to talk about too.

717
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,860
I think it's because of $2 membership.

718
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,620
FeelBetterMental, thank you!

719
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,560
Interesting, I never knew that that was...

720
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,560
That that had a direct...

721
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,560
Had a direct...

722
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:37,940
Impact.

723
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,780
Sorry, I won't make any higher tiers.

724
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,780
I have no plans of making higher tier memberships.

725
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,180
I would like to keep it pretty affordable.

726
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,760
But also, I'm sometimes bad with...

727
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,040
Doing like...

728
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,540
The...

729
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,740
You know.

730
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,560
Membership streams.

731
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,640
John Nuclear, thanks for the 10 gift card!

732
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,780
Mento, you reminded me of...

733
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,420
The criminal who was caught a few years ago.

734
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,860
Who legally changed his name to Beezow Doodoo.

735
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:26,940
What?

736
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,080
Honestly, if I became a criminal...

737
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,180
Which I already am...

738
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,480
I might change my name to that.

739
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,220
I couldn't get a plushie in time, so I settled for the Doki.

740
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,240
Wait, Zack, I think the plushies are still up though.

741
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,660
They're just still on the second patch.

742
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,280
Wish I knew what I was getting it before I bought it.

743
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:45,920
What do you mean?

744
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,140
You bought it without even knowing it!

745
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,640
VTuber doesn't want our money.

746
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,580
No.

747
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,740
Made Megadoodoo.

748
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,380
Minky Megadoodoo.

749
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,180
Why does a Minky Megadoodoo work?

750
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,880
Minky Megadoodoo.

751
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,940
It works!

752
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,620
It works.

753
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,120
Let me spend more money on you.

754
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,740
Minky Megadoodoo.

755
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,960
Give Mint more money while it's in.

756
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,940
Are the plushies being delivered already?

757
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,240
No, I think they're gonna start.

758
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,080
End of this month, maybe?

759
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,100
Beginning of next month?

760
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,320
New Eroge channel name.

761
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,760
That's where I have to stream all the Eroge stuff just in case this one gets taken down.

762
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,020
I just got a new job.

763
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,180
Saltycat, congrats!

764
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,580
Congrats!

765
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,240
Good thing we like being hated.

766
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,920
Vector Tom, thanks for the thank you.

767
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,440
Thank you guys for all the superchats, I really appreciate it.

768
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,140
Appreciate it so much.

769
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,080
Apey, a little bit.

770
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,440
There's some other stuff I want to talk about my Japan trip today.

771
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,380
I also want to talk about my 2025 goals.

772
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,580
Let's come up with a goal list.

773
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,340
I have some.

774
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,420
But I want to come up with a proper list of goals and things.

775
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,700
For paying my Minky Megadoodoo tax.

776
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,780
I want to come up with a proper goal list, right?

777
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,620
Nippon.

778
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,960
I keep a ferret!

779
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,060
Welcome to membership.

780
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,600
Sounds like my favorite kind of ferret.

781
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,140
We're three.

782
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:14,960
It's coming!

783
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,580
It's coming, don't worry.

784
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,100
She hates us for superchatting.

785
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,200
I hate you, always.

786
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,200
$100 a month membership.

787
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,840
That's an actual scam.

788
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,900
I would call it a scam.

789
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:41,960
I want to go back to Japan.

790
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,760
I

791
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,060
miss you, everyone.

792
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,600
No way.

793
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,620
I just got back.

794
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,040
I went to Komiket.

795
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,940
And I...

796
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,960
I also went to my favorite VTuber's...

797
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,540
No, sorry.

798
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,300
Not VTuber.

799
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:06,920
Oh gosh.

800
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,640
I think the medicine is kicking in.

801
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,460
My favorite idol's disbanding live concert.

802
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,280
Saw your TF1 tweet.

803
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,860
Eight times in theaters.

804
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:34,780
I...

805
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:40,270
It's great you got to see them last time.

806
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,150
I...

807
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:49,330
For Transformers...

808
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,470
I don't...

809
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,950
Why was it so BL?

810
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:00,070
Squishes mean those puffs puffs.

811
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,450
What does that mean?

812
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:03,550
Stop!

813
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,150
Don't touch there.

814
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,360
It was always BL.

815
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,380
Was it really?

816
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,240
It's just so...

817
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,700
Did I just hear you complain about BL?

818
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,660
No, no, no.

819
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,020
I think it was a good thing.

820
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,740
Trust, trust.

821
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,200
I think it was great.

822
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,320
I just was like...

823
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,580
You know, when people were like...

824
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,120
I didn't expect it to be.

825
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,140
Starscream, Skyfire for life.

826
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,140
I'll be honest.

827
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,700
My knowledge of Transformers is a bit limited.

828
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,800
Because I...

829
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,480
Watched...

830
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,380
I watched...

831
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,880
Beast Wars.

832
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,200
Which is not exactly...

833
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,200
Not exactly the same.

834
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:11,900
Beasties.

835
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,280
So...

836
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,800
But you know, it was really exciting too to be like...

837
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,420
Oh my god!

838
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,080
There's Starscream!

839
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,280
You know, stuff like that.

840
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,160
In this movie too.

841
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,640
And like...

842
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,440
Arach... Arach...

843
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:30,820
What's her name?

844
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,720
Glad to see you back in the meantime.

845
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,640
I really miss you.

846
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,780
Thank you, Katie.

847
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,380
Katie?

848
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,400
Thank you.

849
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,140
One of my favorite Vtubers.

850
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,920
I'm so happy, thank you.

851
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:42,640
Arachnid.

852
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:43,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

853
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,500
Arach...

854
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,560
Black Arachnia.

855
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,040
But what...

856
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,340
I'm trying not to make a stake her for...

857
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,880
The one in Beast Wars.

858
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,560
Anything after Beast Wars is in canon.

859
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,740
I will not be taking questions.

860
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,680
And I will offer no explanations.

861
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,700
Air Arachnid.

862
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,400
Yeah, yeah.

863
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,640
Air Doodoo.

864
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:17,220
Oh,

865
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:22,600
it's...

866
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,360
I...

867
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:24,920
I...

868
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,720
How do you say it?

869
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,440
Air Arachnid or Eye Arachnid?

870
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:31,680
Mmm.

871
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:43,620
Transformer fact, the original Skyfire Jetfire toy was repackaged VF-1 Valkyrie from Hot Cross.

872
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,240
No way!

873
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,360
Air, like Air Jordan.

874
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,600
Or you know, just... Air.

875
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,620
Air.

876
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:52,760
Air.

877
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,860
Air Arachnid because she's a flying vehicle.

878
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,780
Oh, that's so cool!

879
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,940
Oh, I didn't realize that's why she was called it.

880
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,280
I really liked her though.

881
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,500
Yeah, she turned into like the drone looking thing.

882
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:11,720
That's so cool.

883
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,000
Hola, Minto.

884
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:13,580
Hola!

885
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,660
The atmosphere with the 24-7 VOD stream chat has been incredible.

886
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,540
Did you stop by to check it out from time to time?

887
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,340
Very few, very few.

888
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,120
Yeah, I liked her a lot.

889
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,760
And...

890
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,100
You're a soup.

891
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,760
You're a soup.

892
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,180
Thank you, Jed.

893
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,680
Tell your sickness that you need to be healthy.

894
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,100
The stream has your request.

895
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,320
True.

896
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,320
Finally, Mint Snake.

897
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:57,860
Finally.

898
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,000
Actually, it really sucked because...

899
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,460
Some people were like, oh wow, Mint's voice is so dead because she was screaming so much at the concert.

900
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,440
But no.

901
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,120
My voice was like this before the concert.

902
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:19,700
And that made screaming at the concert not very easy.

903
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,600
So I was so sad.

904
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,080
I wanted to scream my heart out.

905
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,020
I've got about 200 Transformers figures.

906
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,940
And 32.

907
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,100
Oh, those are Optimus Primes.

908
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,900
Thumbnail doesn't awake something dark?

909
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,060
What if I wanted to awaken something dark?

910
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,500
Kingdom Hearts?

911
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,280
I've already played Kingdom Hearts before.

912
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,860
Something that would you rather maximize or terrorize?

913
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,940
Can I maximize my terror?

914
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,740
Terrorization.

915
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,300
Can I terrorize to the maximum degree?

916
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,760
lol

917
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,410
Hot dog.

918
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:30,630
Hot dog.

919
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:32,610
Sick in bed?

920
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:33,890
Why is everybody sick?

921
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:35,870
I'm home.

922
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:37,850
Feel better, Triforce?

923
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,190
You've been secretly infected with Fox- Koyuki!

924
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,090
Did you say I wished you a happy birthday earlier?

925
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,490
Sorry, I missed it yesterday.

926
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,090
Fox...

927
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:57,810
Died.

928
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:00,030
She died.

929
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,710
But I really did like Transformers so much.

930
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:11,430
And...

931
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,290
Oh gosh, I feel it kicking in.

932
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:17,610
Hold on.

933
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,410
I'm gonna go get my food real quick.

934
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,550
Sorry, I know it's pretty early in the stream for me to go get some food.

935
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,390
But I'll be really fast.

936
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,110
Like I said, it's already mid.

937
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,190
VRB is super duper fast.

938
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,170
Okay?

939
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,930
VRB is super duper fast.

940
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,160
I told you I'd be fast.

941
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,060
I don't know actually how fast that was.

942
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,140
I stood up in the world's span.

943
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,400
It was spinning, baby.

944
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,600
The world is spinning, baby.

945
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,340
From the medicine.

946
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,540
From the medicine.

947
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,340
It's been 30 minutes?

948
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,360
Don't lie to me.

949
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,520
I'm not that...

950
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,700
I'm not...

951
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,520
I'm not that hungover.

952
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,820
It does feel like...

953
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,260
I've never had a hangover before.

954
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,640
But when you take medicine like this, it does feel like you have a hangover, doesn't it?

955
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,680
Go to sleep?

956
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:39,000
I actually have a meeting in two hours, so...

957
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,360
You guys are gonna make sure I don't fall asleep.

958
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,040
So I can get to my meeting.

959
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,120
Okay?

960
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,770
Why do you take sleep medicine?

961
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,550
So I can sleep.

962
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:12,910
Dummy.

963
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,170
Megatron, wake up.

964
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,040
That guy is so silly.

965
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,360
He's like...

966
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,160
Megatron is so stupid.

967
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,520
He's like...

968
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,840
He gets betrayed once and is just like...

969
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,740
I'm not gonna let this happen to me again.

970
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,780
That guy is so stupid.

971
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,940
You took sleep medicine before a meeting?

972
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,780
What do you think of the Snake Eater remake?

973
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,760
I'm excited for it.

974
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:32,030
Is Oshie still mad at you?

975
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:32,730
Is Oshie still mad at you?

976
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:32,770
I think

977
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,880
I...

978
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,700
My only gripe is I wish that they had like...

979
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,800
I wish they had a...

980
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,540
Like I understand that they were miner guys.

981
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,900
Little miner bots.

982
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,940
And that they were always there.

983
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:04,140
But like, I wish there was something a little bit more to making Megatron switch.

984
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:09,440
Because he's like... He's like... Oh gosh, what's his name?

985
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,320
Sussy Prime?

986
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:17,720
He's not really... Sus... Sus... Suspicious Prime.

987
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,420
What's his name?

988
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,280
I can't remember.

989
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,200
Sentinel Prime!

990
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,800
I knew I started with an S.

991
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,560
I couldn't remember.

992
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,000
Sentinel Prime.

993
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,130
Sentinel Prime.

994
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,150
He's like, Sentinel Prime took everything from me.

995
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:51,650
But I'm like, you're no different from Optimus Prime, you know?

996
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:55,090
Everybody lost something.

997
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:58,330
So I wish there was a little bit more of a oomph.

998
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:02,690
Megatron just basically went F everything.

999
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:03,370
I know!

1000
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,410
He got burned once and was just like...

1001
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:09,850
That's all it took.

1002
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:11,210
That's all it took.

1003
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,860
Part of D16's downfall into Megatron is that Megatron was always inside him.

1004
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,450
He's just a sensitive guy.

1005
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,080
He's just a sensitive baby.

1006
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,900
He was always an angry person, he just hid it well.

1007
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:52,180
If you rewatch it, you can notice the subtleties of how he acts.

1008
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,500
Well, he did always kind of like, you know...

1009
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:04,500
Optimus would be like... Sorry, I can't remember Optimus's...

1010
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:07,840
Not Optimus's name.

1011
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,520
But he would be like, yeah, I'm gonna do this thing!

1012
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,820
Orion Pax, you guys are so good at remembering things.

1013
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,420
Thank you.

1014
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,100
Orion would be like, yeah, let's do the thing!

1015
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,780
And D would be like, no!

1016
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,260
What the hell is wrong with you?

1017
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,260
But he should have trusted... He should have had faith in his friend.

1018
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,600
He should have had faith in his friend.

1019
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,700
His comrade.

1020
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:55,610
His brother.

1021
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:57,910
I always wanted to...

1022
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:01,810
I always wanted to...

1023
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:09,810
I always wanted to...

1024
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:16,850
I love how much that's picking up on Twitter and stuff.

1025
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,170
Everyone's talking about the brother.

1026
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,610
I always wanted a brother.

1027
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,090
I always wanted a brother.

1028
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,260
Did you know that's actually Scar singing and not Mufasa?

1029
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,880
I didn't know that actually.

1030
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,740
I kind of know the story for Mufasa.

1031
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,360
Kind of.

1032
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,600
I always wanted a brother.

1033
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,180
A guy who's post went viral.

1034
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,280
I ended up listening to it so much he likes it now.

1035
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,360
That's Stockholm Syndrome, baby!

1036
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,080
That's...that's...that's...stereo...that's...that's...case...case...casebook...

1037
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:08,420
No.

1038
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:09,520
Case.

1039
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,760
That's a textbook.

1040
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,400
That's a textbook.

1041
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,620
Casebook.

1042
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,260
Stockholm Syndrome.

1043
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,540
The comics which inspired the movie did it better.

1044
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,520
Megatron started out as a pacifist and political activist.

1045
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:40,120
He tried to peacefully overturn the system, but after the senate tried to have him beaten to death, he broke.

1046
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:40,620
What?

1047
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,600
Have you tried Project Wingman?

1048
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,540
I haven't yet, but I have it.

1049
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,140
I own it.

1050
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:49,980
I own it.

1051
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:52,620
Brother.

1052
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,860
I always wanted a brother.

1053
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,200
I always wanted a brother.

1054
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:59,140
I always wanted a brother.

1055
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,300
What was I going to say?

1056
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,740
I don't remember.

1057
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,560
How was A Yummy Mama on Kamiket?

1058
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:15,920
So great!

1059
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,860
Um, actually, okay, gosh, my trip was just jam-packed.

1060
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:27,680
From day one, I arrived...I arrived at, uh, in Japan.

1061
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:32,500
And, um, actually, there's another artist I like named Pannomimi.

1062
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,700
And she had a collaboration cafe.

1063
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:44,080
That was until...it was ending the first day of Kamiket.

1064
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:51,140
And so I was like, well, I'll be at Kamiket, so I can't go.

1065
01:04:52,060 --> 01:05:00,760
So I got...I landed and then immediately went to...went to the cafe.

1066
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,720
What a culture thumbnail.

1067
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:05,780
Thank you!

1068
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,080
And so I went to...I actually got some footage of that.

1069
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:16,320
I might make, like, a little YouTube short about it or something.

1070
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,500
Did you get merch for it?

1071
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,060
Oh my gosh, I was so upset!

1072
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:29,800
Because I was...later...I was there later, they closed the merch stuff, so I couldn't get any merch.

1073
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:31,740
So sad.

1074
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,600
But, um...

1075
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,120
Uh...

1076
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,640
They let you film?

1077
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:39,080
Yeah!

1078
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,560
So, it was nothing.

1079
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,260
Usually they let you film in places like that.

1080
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,160
But yeah, so that was day one.

1081
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,660
And then...

1082
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,820
I met up with someone.

1083
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,440
Before I went to the cafe.

1084
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:11,600
The cafe.

1085
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,140
Who was it?

1086
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,980
Well, Kiara and I didn't get to meet up, unfortunately.

1087
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,460
We tried, we did.

1088
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:37,600
Wait, why is my...hold on, my thing keeps getting all messed up.

1089
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:45,680
Kojima.

1090
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,480
Oh yeah, totally.

1091
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,960
Scarlet Megadodo!

1092
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:54,900
Hello, Minky Megadodo from Scarlet Megadodo.

1093
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,540
Thank you, Scarlet Megadodo!

1094
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,340
I met up with someone.

1095
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,060
Oh my god, I'm the worst.

1096
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,400
Sorry to whoever I met up with.

1097
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,940
It's truly the sicky brain.

1098
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,160
I promise.

1099
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:26,630
It might have been Kojima.

1100
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,790
Yeah, you know what?

1101
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:33,570
I met up with Hideo Kojima.

1102
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:41,610
I don't know who I met up with.

1103
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:43,830
Is it Pia?

1104
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:48,190
No, I hung out with Pia after the first day of Comiket.

1105
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:51,690
I hung out...actually, I met up with Ayami Mama.

1106
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:55,050
We didn't really hang out.

1107
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:58,990
She basically came to my hotel to give me...

1108
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,190
She gave me...

1109
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,190
She gave me tickets for Comiket.

1110
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:08,090
So...

1111
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,530
And I gave her Baja Blast.

1112
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:15,870
Ayami, who's Ayami?

1113
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:18,550
Ayami is my mama.

1114
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:20,290
Ayami drew me.

1115
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,050
Made me look like this.

1116
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,150
And I gave her Baja Blast.

1117
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,890
And she was like, you brought all of...

1118
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:30,790
It was like a six pack of Baja Blast.

1119
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:37,170
She was like, you brought all of this with you?

1120
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:40,650
My suitcase was very heavy because I brought that.

1121
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:44,530
And then I brought a bunch of stuff, like old anime merch that I was selling.

1122
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:47,810
And I took it to Mandarake and I sold it.

1123
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:53,090
So like, actually my suitcase was so full.

1124
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:57,290
Baja Blast.

1125
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:02,650
I don't know, what does a Baja Blast taste like?

1126
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,450
Yeah, American water.

1127
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:13,670
How much did you get?

1128
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,510
Like 300 yen?

1129
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:21,550
Minto fluid.

1130
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:22,490
I don't believe you.

1131
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:27,290
Sweet limey.

1132
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:30,450
Oh,

1133
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,500
what does Mountain Dew taste like?

1134
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,680
Never had it.

1135
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,180
It's not that I don't like carbonated drinks, I can't have them.

1136
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,120
Battery acid.

1137
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,260
It's mostly orange juice?

1138
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:58,880
What?

1139
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,260
No way.

1140
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,320
Still not over the thumbnail.

1141
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,660
Glad you like it.

1142
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:08,760
Liar.

1143
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:24,030
It's not orange juice.

1144
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,330
It said it's mostly orange juice.

1145
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:28,130
Are you calling them a liar?

1146
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,490
Are you calling them a liar?

1147
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:33,030
They sound like a liar.

1148
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,810
That's how I learned that Minto Matara never went to Taco Bell to get tacos and Baja Blast.

1149
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,390
No, we actually did not do that.

1150
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:48,390
I was not supposed to take her through a car wash.

1151
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,350
We didn't do that either.

1152
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:52,490
Just informed that...

1153
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:54,390
What else?

1154
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:00,850
I was just informed what else Puff Puffs could mean.

1155
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,130
I mean their puffy cheeks.

1156
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:05,810
When you're doing your new face, I'd make it Dogeza, of course.

1157
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:05,830
What?

1158
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,750
I forgive you.

1159
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,970
We're not calling you a truther.

1160
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:36,830
I'm okay.

1161
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:43,870
When you play Monster Girl Quest, you'll do all the voices right.

1162
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,050
Isn't that a game voiced?

1163
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,950
A lot of it.

1164
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:51,290
Sorry for coughing in your ears, by the way.

1165
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,010
Coughing baby.

1166
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,670
What was the weather like in your home?

1167
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,310
It was dry.

1168
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:09,510
It was cold.

1169
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:17,370
But because I got the tickets for Miami Mama, I didn't have to wait super long for...

1170
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:22,370
You know how people get their first train for Comiket and everything like that?

1171
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:24,530
I didn't have to do any of that, which was really nice.

1172
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:29,990
I was super grateful about that.

1173
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:31,530
So I could...

1174
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:34,650
The second day...

1175
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,570
The second day, I just got to line up early.

1176
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:48,830
I went for some of the VTuber mamas and papas.

1177
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,850
So I...

1178
01:12:53,650 --> 01:12:55,010
Can feel the babu.

1179
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,830
I got to get a lot of stuff that I did truly want.

1180
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:03,290
Only one thing.

1181
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:07,250
One thing sold out, and that was one of the books by Minyom.

1182
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:08,830
Minyom.

1183
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:10,650
It was one of the Tummy books.

1184
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:17,690
Just any cute cosplayers.

1185
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:18,510
Oh my gosh, I did!

1186
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:19,850
Oh my god.

1187
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:20,630
You guys!

1188
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,630
I was so...

1189
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:27,890
I saw a group of Metal Gear cosplayers.

1190
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:29,590
And I was like...

1191
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:33,630
I must get a picture of the Metal Gear cosplayers.

1192
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:35,390
I was like...

1193
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:37,910
I will get the picture of the Metal Gear cosplayers.

1194
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:41,110
And I'm like sitting there, and they're all like kind of...

1195
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:42,810
In their... They're like...

1196
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:44,190
In a circle basically.

1197
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,670
You can kind of tell they're a bit of a tight knit group.

1198
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:50,610
Probably because there's not very many Metal Gear cosplayers.

1199
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,170
But they were all kind of like just standing there.

1200
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:57,290
And I was standing waiting for them to kind of finish their conversation.

1201
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:58,730
I was like...

1202
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:01,190
I took out like a little snake.

1203
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:03,350
I took out my little snake, and I was like...

1204
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,970
I'm going to get them to take a picture with this.

1205
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,750
Because it was like a Kaz...

1206
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,290
An Ocelot...

1207
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:10,810
A Christmas boss.

1208
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,910
Like he had like a red outfit and everything.

1209
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:14,570
It was so cute.

1210
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:16,450
Hold on.

1211
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:18,250
I got a sneaky shot of them.

1212
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:20,070
Let me find it.

1213
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:25,090
Hold on.

1214
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:26,730
I got a... I took a sneak shot.

1215
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:29,910
A snake shot if you will.

1216
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:36,270
Where did I put it?

1217
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,610
Oh here.

1218
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:41,830
I can check the picture... I can check the video.

1219
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,080
I'm looking.

1220
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:51,620
I'm waiting.

1221
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,760
Oh yeah.

1222
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,600
There was like...

1223
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,540
One guy was like just a regular soldier guy.

1224
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:08,080
There was two Metal Gear Solid 5 Ocelots.

1225
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,180
And one Metal Gear Solid 3 Ocelot.

1226
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,420
And I was like just sitting there waiting.

1227
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,640
And I was like...

1228
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:26,700
And they were like not noticing me at all.

1229
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,140
Maybe because they don't have a sixth sense.

1230
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:29,800
I don't know.

1231
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,740
And so I was just like okay well I'm gonna move over.

1232
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:37,080
And I'm gonna... There was a cute Marine cosplayer.

1233
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,540
So I was like I'll just take a video of her.

1234
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,700
And I took a video of her and it's really cute.

1235
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:48,500
And then I was like okay I did that.

1236
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,760
And she was like right next to them so I was like okay.

1237
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,860
Well now that I'm done with her I'll just go back to them.

1238
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:57,700
And I was like...

1239
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,760
They never noticed me.

1240
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,780
The entire time.

1241
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,700
I was like...

1242
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,360
I just want a picture of you.

1243
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,280
Stealth master, maybe.

1244
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,680
Camo index too high.

1245
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,340
PSA, don't just take out your little snake.

1246
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,180
No I have to.

1247
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,780
I thought they would notice, right?

1248
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:44,240
At a US con recently I was walking by a doujin booth.

1249
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,300
Don't really care about them but I caught Mignon's book in the corner of my eye.

1250
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,180
And said here is my card, please sir.

1251
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:55,660
Understandable.

1252
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,460
Weird, when I take out my little snake at big events I get escorted from the premises.

1253
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:43,960
I was with those snake cosplayers the second day with my mint phantom cardboard box.

1254
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:44,780
What?

1255
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,060
What do you mean mint phantom cardboard box?

1256
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,520
I did not see that.

1257
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,440
I did not see either.

1258
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,620
You should nonchalantly play the exclamation point song.

1259
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:02,400
Is that right?

1260
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,780
Yeah, I was kind of bummed about it.

1261
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,200
I was like I really want a picture of these guys.

1262
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:09,940
But they were deep in their conversation.

1263
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,940
I was like okay, I'll just leave.

1264
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,200
And then I took a creep shot from the escalator.

1265
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,020
It's on Twitter, did you tag me?

1266
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,320
Did you tag me?

1267
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,760
Did you tag me?

1268
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:34,840
But...

1269
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:43,200
The thing about Comiket was it was just way too crowded.

1270
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:48,940
Oh my gosh, I love being in the Blue Archive, but I hate being in the Blue Archive area.

1271
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,400
Because it was just so...

1272
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,600
Oh my god, it was craziness.

1273
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,080
Sometimes there would be a table I would want to go to.

1274
01:18:58,960 --> 01:18:59,480
And...

1275
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,780
Let's just Comiket in general.

1276
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:03,760
No...

1277
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:05,620
No...

1278
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:07,380
This was other level.

1279
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,740
This was absolutely other level.

1280
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,480
And...

1281
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:18,420
I would want to go to a table and I would never be able to get to it.

1282
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:20,480
Because I'd be like...

1283
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,260
I could never reach it.

1284
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:30,370
You think being into the popular thing would be great?

1285
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:31,270
It is great!

1286
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,450
I got to get so much stuff!

1287
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:35,210
It was so awesome!

1288
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:39,030
I went last year, worse than that.

1289
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:42,190
Did I go last year?

1290
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,910
I don't think I went last year.

1291
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:51,230
Just like when Conquolet was big.

1292
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,990
But...

1293
01:19:56,990 --> 01:20:03,070
I still think I got a decent amount of stuff.

1294
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:08,510
Enough that my backpack was heavy and hurting me.

1295
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:10,610
So, you know...

1296
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:13,570
I guess I can't complain too much.

1297
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:16,510
I got everything for Blue Archive that I wanted.

1298
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:19,310
Comiket looks cool but scary?

1299
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,130
No, don't be scared at all.

1300
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:23,270
It's very actually...

1301
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:28,550
You know, it's a lot of people but it's quite streamlined.

1302
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:29,950
It's actually not so bad.

1303
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,720
Like, lines are very organized.

1304
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,060
I'd say it's better to...

1305
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,100
To go...

1306
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,720
Have... Especially if it's your first time.

1307
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,540
Go with no expectations.

1308
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,100
You know?

1309
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,980
You could be like, oh...

1310
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:02,620
Did I see this?

1311
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:03,980
Like, you know...

1312
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,700
You can have some artists you want to see.

1313
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,420
But...

1314
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,360
Especially if you're like, you know, have...

1315
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,560
So basically the popular artists are the wall tables.

1316
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:16,680
So...

1317
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,640
They are...

1318
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:22,600
The lines are usually like outside and everything.

1319
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,600
And it's a much longer wait.

1320
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,320
So if you're like...

1321
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,320
If you try to hit up like...

1322
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,600
If you're like, oh, my favorite artists are wall tables...

1323
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,420
You're gonna probably have a bad time.

1324
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,100
You're probably gonna have a bad time.

1325
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:41,580
And you...

1326
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:44,540
And if you get in any later than the very beginning...

1327
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:45,600
You might not...

1328
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,700
They might sell out.

1329
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:51,220
I miss when Comiket was free though.

1330
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,120
I don't think I...

1331
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,120
I never went when it was free.

1332
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,040
Welcome back, Minto.

1333
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:00,720
Thank you!

1334
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,800
And honestly...

1335
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,640
There's so many great tables that aren't just wall tables.

1336
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:13,600
Like, so many...

1337
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,780
Underrated artists.

1338
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:16,860
One of my favorite things is like...

1339
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:19,440
Walking around and just being like, oh my god, that's so cute.

1340
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:20,780
And just buying it.

1341
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,340
Which is what I really wanted to do with Blue Archive.

1342
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:27,140
Obviously, I had some artists that I wanted to pick up from.

1343
01:22:27,260 --> 01:22:27,700
And I did.

1344
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:29,820
But...

1345
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:32,400
For some of them, I was just like...

1346
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,300
It's just too crowded.

1347
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:39,700
The longest line I waited in was about an hour and a half.

1348
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,460
I'd say.

1349
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:48,460
And that was for an artist that is...

1350
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,580
That is an official Blue Archive artist, so...

1351
01:22:57,410 --> 01:23:00,110
Maybe the second longest line I waited in was Mignon.

1352
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:04,210
Probably.

1353
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:11,490
I got lost trying to find Ikomochi, Fumoko's papa.

1354
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:14,710
So...

1355
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:16,790
That one was a bit of a line too.

1356
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:17,950
But...

1357
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:19,710
If you get in early, it's...

1358
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:20,670
It's, you know...

1359
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:22,370
And...

1360
01:23:22,370 --> 01:23:24,270
The thing is, is like...

1361
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:26,750
They do run out of stock sometimes.

1362
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,070
But...

1363
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:34,690
It's usually like around the afternoon time that things really start selling out from the popular people.

1364
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:35,870
So...

1365
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,730
You're usually good.

1366
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:38,630
You're usually good to like...

1367
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:39,890
Until like 12 PM.

1368
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:44,830
So...

1369
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:45,590
Hope you get better soon.

1370
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:46,370
Thank you!

1371
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:48,430
Yeah...

1372
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:50,330
But I think I got sick of Kamikaze.

1373
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:51,510
So...

1374
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:52,430
When does it start?

1375
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:56,390
1030...

1376
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:58,490
Gonna share your haul or too explicit?

1377
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:00,030
Oh, I posted it on Twitter.

1378
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:00,910
I can share.

1379
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:03,750
I can share.

1380
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:05,470
Wait, my chat just froze.

1381
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:07,570
Thank you, YouTube.

1382
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,670
Thank you.

1383
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,230
Hold on, let me grab it.

1384
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:13,730
Let me grab...

1385
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:15,110
My...

1386
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:16,350
My haul.

1387
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:18,410
Let me grab my haul.

1388
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:27,030
Oh...

1389
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:28,190
Oh...

1390
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:31,960
Okay, so...

1391
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,340
I have day 1...

1392
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:37,120
And day 2.

1393
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,500
Okie dokie.

1394
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,840
So day 1 I got basically all Blue Archive.

1395
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,840
Day 1...

1396
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,520
Was basically...

1397
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,480
All Blue Archive!

1398
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:56,460
So...

1399
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:56,960
Yippee!

1400
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,420
Very cute.

1401
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,880
My favorite thing was the Koharu stuff on the right side.

1402
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:09,560
I was very, very happy to find that.

1403
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:20,870
Double Ayami.

1404
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,170
I know, I feel like I need to give one away.

1405
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,390
Because they're both the same.

1406
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:33,350
I never bought from Ayami.

1407
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:35,010
Actually, from Ayami Mama at...

1408
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:35,370
At...

1409
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:38,650
At Comiket.

1410
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:40,870
Because she won't let me pay!

1411
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:44,370
And I was like...

1412
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:46,450
She told me she was going to...

1413
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,050
Get me...

1414
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:51,670
She was going to gift me one of her books.

1415
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:52,510
Because I'm in it.

1416
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:54,110
I was like...

1417
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:54,530
Yippee!

1418
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:56,690
But I'll just buy the rest.

1419
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,120
Like on, you know...

1420
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:03,190
On...

1421
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:04,210
What's the word?

1422
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:05,390
Booth.

1423
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:09,470
And then...

1424
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,330
And then...

1425
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,130
I see her the day I'm leaving.

1426
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:14,310
She gives me everything!

1427
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:15,290
And I was like...

1428
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:15,850
No!

1429
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:16,550
Mama!

1430
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:19,670
Please, no!

1431
01:26:19,990 --> 01:26:23,310
So, that's why there was no Ayami stuff in the haul pictures.

1432
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:24,510
Because...

1433
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:25,110
I was like...

1434
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:25,810
I'm not gonna...

1435
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:26,970
I don't...

1436
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,550
I want to pay you for it!

1437
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,350
She's so sweet.

1438
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:34,170
I love Ayami Mama.

1439
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:46,260
Hmm...

1440
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:47,460
I get her mental.

1441
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,620
Give up and accept it.

1442
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:48,880
No!

1443
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,500
She used to give stuff back.

1444
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:55,280
Also, welcome back.

1445
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:55,940
Thank you!

1446
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,040
Yeah, I do!

1447
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:57,880
I give her...

1448
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,080
I give her like...

1449
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,380
The Baha Blast.

1450
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,160
I didn't just have her...

1451
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,540
Give her Baha Blast, though.

1452
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,060
I gave her other stuff, too.

1453
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,740
I gave her some...

1454
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:11,180
Some...

1455
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,560
Snackies and things.

1456
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:13,660
Yeah.

1457
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,380
And then, day 2 haul...

1458
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:19,440
Was...

1459
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:19,760
Ta-da!

1460
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:23,580
I find myself more and more loving...

1461
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:24,280
You know...

1462
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,240
Original characters.

1463
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,180
Besides, like, a Blue Archive...

1464
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:28,720
Situation.

1465
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,780
I find myself really loving original characters.

1466
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:37,060
So...

1467
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,220
This is...

1468
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,620
This is...

1469
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,280
Day 2!

1470
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:51,980
And...

1471
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,380
Day 2 was like...

1472
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:54,700
Bunch of...

1473
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,700
OC...

1474
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:56,100
Stuff.

1475
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:00,220
And also VTubers, so...

1476
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:00,820
Yeah, yeah.

1477
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:02,740
I see Baobao.

1478
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,060
Yeah!

1479
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,540
I lined up for Ikomochi.

1480
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,760
I see Minion art.

1481
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,200
Good.

1482
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,780
Oh my gosh.

1483
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:13,890
Minion is just...

1484
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,980
Was all that merch heavy?

1485
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,880
It was very heavy!

1486
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,040
In fact, it was heavier day 2 than day 1.

1487
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,240
I don't ever learn my lesson.

1488
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,480
I like...

1489
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,020
Want to...

1490
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:30,200
Bring a...

1491
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,300
Like a suitcase.

1492
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,660
A rolly suitcase next time I go or something.

1493
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:34,920
But I never learn my lesson.

1494
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,360
No.

1495
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,500
Bottom left is...

1496
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,560
This is actually like...

1497
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,120
I saw this artist on Twitter.

1498
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:50,860
Before...

1499
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:51,380
Comiket.

1500
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,380
And it's like a...

1501
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:54,460
It's like a...

1502
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:57,780
White out version of Reimu, Miku and Haruhi.

1503
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,020
So...

1504
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:03,740
Yeah, yeah.

1505
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:07,180
I didn't know this artist.

1506
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,220
I just popped up in my timeline one day.

1507
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:10,500
And...

1508
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,580
I thought it was so cute.

1509
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,650
And then I saw that the book was going to be at...

1510
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:14,820
Comiket.

1511
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,300
So I was like...

1512
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,260
I'm gonna go buy it.

1513
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,800
But I didn't realize they're the artist for like...

1514
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,000
A lot of the AmiAmi...

1515
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:23,200
Like postcards and things too.

1516
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:26,400
So I was like...

1517
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:26,700
Wow!

1518
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:31,400
I really wanted to get this Riko stuff up at the top.

1519
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,900
Especially the acrylic.

1520
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,600
Mizugi acrylic.

1521
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,700
They got Kedama milk.

1522
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,600
Some of these were also just artists that I like...

1523
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,160
Happened to stumble upon.

1524
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:48,180
I...

1525
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:49,700
It's funny.

1526
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:50,840
For this one...

1527
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,780
For this CD...

1528
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:53,800
I was waiting to talk to Mosaic Wave.

1529
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:57,260
Because they have a booth at Comiket.

1530
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:58,560
And...

1531
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,700
I was waiting to...

1532
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:02,980
To talk to them.

1533
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:04,680
And...

1534
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,220
But some guy was talking to them.

1535
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,400
So I was just like...

1536
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,000
Hanging out.

1537
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,980
And the table next to Mosaic Wave was like...

1538
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:14,060
Hey, by the way, do you know Touhou?

1539
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:14,900
I was like...

1540
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:15,900
Yeah, I love Touhou.

1541
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,680
They were like, listen to our album.

1542
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:18,920
It was an album.

1543
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,100
It was like a best of album.

1544
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,000
That was like...

1545
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,380
EDM and jazz.

1546
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,080
I was like...

1547
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,960
Do you have one that's just jazz?

1548
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,960
They were like, yeah, this is my recommendation.

1549
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,480
And so...

1550
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,220
I got...

1551
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:35,000
You like jazz?

1552
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,560
I got the CD of Touhou Jazz.

1553
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:50,810
And then some of you might recognize this artist.

1554
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:51,810
It's Rosary.

1555
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:56,410
So...

1556
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:58,250
Those are my hauls.

1557
01:30:58,690 --> 01:30:59,610
Those are my hauls.

1558
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,310
Those are my hauls.

1559
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:02,870
From Comiket.

1560
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:09,710
You can get any genre you like with Touhou music.

1561
01:31:09,710 --> 01:31:11,410
I know, it's so great, right?

1562
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:14,550
So awesome.

1563
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:15,910
Hold on, I'm sick of this song.

1564
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:17,710
I'm gonna delete it from...

1565
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:21,070
There we go.

1566
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:25,630
Yeah.

1567
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:27,970
So, Comiket was good.

1568
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:32,010
First day, I went out afterwards with Piappi.

1569
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:33,270
And we...

1570
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:36,550
She took me to a...

1571
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:38,270
Like, it's called the Starbucks...

1572
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,430
Roastery, I think is what it is.

1573
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:43,190
And...

1574
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:47,450
You didn't find the Sayori Nekopara doujin?

1575
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:50,270
There was a booth for...

1576
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:53,750
Nekopara, but when I got there, it was all sold out.

1577
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:55,390
Thank you for the food!

1578
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,090
Thank you for the food!

1579
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:57,150
Thank you!

1580
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:00,430
And it also wasn't in, like, the actual...

1581
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:03,270
It wasn't in the...

1582
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:06,010
Like, doujin halls.

1583
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:07,330
It was in the...

1584
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:08,810
There's a...

1585
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:11,590
So basically, the way Comiket is divided is...

1586
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:12,870
There's east and west halls.

1587
01:32:13,230 --> 01:32:14,870
Which are, like, all the doujin stuff.

1588
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:17,290
And then there's a corporate area.

1589
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:19,470
And, um...

1590
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:20,270
That's where...

1591
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,210
That's where...

1592
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:24,450
Like, Yostar was there.

1593
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,090
Nekopara stuff was there.

1594
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:36,110
Lots of stuff.

1595
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,420
So, uh...

1596
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,100
It's just like that one episode of Lucky Star.

1597
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:44,520
Yeah!

1598
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:48,940
So, um...

1599
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,020
Check out Heaven Burns Red.

1600
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,120
I didn't see the booth!

1601
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:58,260
I didn't see it.

1602
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:01,720
So...

1603
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,040
What the hell is happening?

1604
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,520
Why is my camera acting all weird?

1605
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,440
I got a new iPhone and the tracking on it is being very strange.

1606
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,020
Oh, there we go.

1607
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,020
I can turn.

1608
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,860
Maybe it's my glasses.

1609
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:25,190
But yeah, so...

1610
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:26,010
And then...

1611
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:29,950
In east and west hall, you'll have different...

1612
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:30,530
Or...

1613
01:33:30,530 --> 01:33:32,530
Yeah, east and west sides, you'll have different halls.

1614
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:33,350
So it'll be like...

1615
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:36,870
Hall 1 through 7 or something like that.

1616
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:38,130
So, um...

1617
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:44,090
There's so much to explore.

1618
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:46,950
So, so, so much to explore.

1619
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:50,950
And it's very easy to miss things if you don't have, like...

1620
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:53,910
Specific places you're trying to...

1621
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:55,910
Trying to find.

1622
01:33:56,170 --> 01:33:57,730
You know, trying to see yourself.

1623
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:02,110
Did you ever have a chance to visit Comiket when ZUN was there selling a new game?

1624
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:04,110
No, this time I've never...

1625
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,810
Honestly, I haven't been to Comiket very much.

1626
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,250
I think this is my third time.

1627
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,150
Third time only.

1628
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:11,470
Having gone, so...

1629
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,250
It wasn't actually that...

1630
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,250
I've never actually been that much because...

1631
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:18,470
You know...

1632
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:22,150
It's very expensive traveling to Japan in this season.

1633
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:23,590
And I won't...

1634
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,770
You won't catch me at summer Comiket either.

1635
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:28,270
But it's very expensive.

1636
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:33,490
The tickets are like massive amount because everybody's traveling for New Year's.

1637
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:35,210
So...

1638
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:36,590
You know...

1639
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:43,590
I only was able to go once before I started VTubing.

1640
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:48,810
I wish I could go someday.

1641
01:34:48,970 --> 01:34:49,910
Oh, we can too!

1642
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:51,010
I hope we can.

1643
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:52,670
Yeah.

1644
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:02,150
Did you do anything for New Year's Eve or did you just hang out at your hotel?

1645
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:03,850
Actually, for New Year's Eve...

1646
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:06,210
I mean, my mom and I were supposed to go get unagi.

1647
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:09,290
But my throat was...

1648
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:11,350
killing me that night.

1649
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:12,030
Oh my gosh.

1650
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:13,410
I went out like...

1651
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:15,530
I feel like I did nothing this trip.

1652
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:18,370
I went out shopping for clothes.

1653
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:19,850
I was just like, okay, I'm gonna go...

1654
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:21,430
I'm gonna go grab some clothes, whatever.

1655
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:24,010
And...

1656
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:27,470
Praise me because I did not buy very many clothes.

1657
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:29,350
I bought like...

1658
01:35:31,330 --> 01:35:33,290
I bought like two, three things.

1659
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:37,850
I saved money.

1660
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:39,830
Well, I spent it all at Comiket.

1661
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:47,650
But...

1662
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:50,890
Sorry,

1663
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:55,770
what was I saying?

1664
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:59,950
Yeah, I went out to buy clothes because I was just like, okay.

1665
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:02,250
And then that evening, I was like, okay...

1666
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:05,990
I'm gonna go eat unagi with Ayami mama.

1667
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:07,190
And...

1668
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:09,410
Not sick, she's a sicko.

1669
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:10,770
She's a sicko.

1670
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:13,870
So...

1671
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:16,050
But then my throat hurt so bad.

1672
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:18,890
I was like, I don't think I can swallow anything.

1673
01:36:20,370 --> 01:36:20,930
So...

1674
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:21,930
I stayed...

1675
01:36:21,930 --> 01:36:22,990
I stayed...

1676
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:23,970
Home.

1677
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:26,670
And then...

1678
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:28,570
The day after, I was like, oh no.

1679
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:31,690
I'm sick, sick.

1680
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:32,230
No.

1681
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:36,650
And so on New Year's, I stayed in the entire day.

1682
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:39,110
I stayed in my hotel room the entire day.

1683
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:42,330
It was kind of a bummer.

1684
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:48,490
I did go to Kandamyojin the day after.

1685
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:51,890
So on the second, I went to...

1686
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:54,410
Which is the shrine in Harajuku.

1687
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:56,110
Went to Kandamyojin.

1688
01:36:58,390 --> 01:36:59,530
No, sorry.

1689
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:00,370
I'm a liar.

1690
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:01,110
Meiji Jingu.

1691
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:03,030
I went to Kandamyojin later.

1692
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:03,610
Sorry.

1693
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:04,750
Meiji Jingu.

1694
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:06,410
I went to...

1695
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:09,930
On the second.

1696
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:11,770
I'm a liar.

1697
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:13,150
I'm a liar.

1698
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:18,610
But I learned that Meiji Jingu...

1699
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:19,570
Does not do...

1700
01:37:19,570 --> 01:37:22,450
You know how you get the fortunes that are like...

1701
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:25,130
Big fortune.

1702
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:26,230
No fortune.

1703
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:27,770
They don't do those.

1704
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:31,010
So...

1705
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:33,130
I got...

1706
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:35,570
It was just like...

1707
01:37:35,570 --> 01:37:36,650
Hold on.

1708
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:37,990
I have it around here somewhere.

1709
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:41,290
Where did I put it?

1710
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:46,470
I might have put it in a clear file already.

1711
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:47,550
Filed it away.

1712
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:53,510
So I...

1713
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:56,810
It was just something like...

1714
01:37:56,810 --> 01:37:57,550
Hold on.

1715
01:37:57,550 --> 01:37:58,770
I want to find it now.

1716
01:37:58,850 --> 01:37:59,390
Hold on.

1717
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:02,710
I think it's right over here.

1718
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:04,750
I think it's right over here.

1719
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:12,990
I had it.

1720
01:38:13,010 --> 01:38:13,470
I swear.

1721
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,150
I had it like just earlier.

1722
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:18,130
I had it just earlier.

1723
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:40,070
I can't find it.

1724
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:41,410
I give up.

1725
01:38:43,070 --> 01:38:44,030
I give up.

1726
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:45,010
I give up so easily.

1727
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:46,970
I give up.

1728
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:56,830
And so...

1729
01:38:57,570 --> 01:38:58,870
It was like...

1730
01:38:58,870 --> 01:39:00,290
It was like...

1731
01:39:01,610 --> 01:39:02,170
Basically...

1732
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:04,230
Be determined or something.

1733
01:39:04,690 --> 01:39:06,130
So I was like, this sucks.

1734
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:07,730
So...

1735
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:09,570
The day after...

1736
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:12,710
Kandamyojin, I went to...

1737
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:13,970
Why do I keep saying it?

1738
01:39:14,090 --> 01:39:15,790
Meiji Jingu, the one in Harajuku.

1739
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:19,510
I went to Kandamyojin, which is the shrine in Akihabara.

1740
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:21,990
And both were just insane.

1741
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:23,010
Crazy busy.

1742
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:25,270
And I pulled my fortune there.

1743
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:26,610
And I got...

1744
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:29,530
So basically there is this one...

1745
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:31,050
There is a fortune...

1746
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:32,830
That's like above bad luck.

1747
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:34,710
Which is like, your luck is coming.

1748
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,570
And I pulled that last year too.

1749
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:43,170
I pulled that last year too.

1750
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,630
When is my luck gonna come?

1751
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:48,770
When will my luck be here?

1752
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:53,970
Director Wada.

1753
01:39:54,730 --> 01:39:55,950
Thank you for the firecracker.

1754
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:57,330
Thank you so much.

1755
01:39:58,850 --> 01:39:59,410
Luck.

1756
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:02,170
It means things are looking up.

1757
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:02,590
Maybe.

1758
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:04,590
But they're always looking up.

1759
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:05,490
They're never up though.

1760
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:06,810
They're just looking up.

1761
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:08,070
Just never up.

1762
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:09,250
But!

1763
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:14,490
So the reason I went to Japan in the first place, this trip, was...

1764
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:17,070
For my favorite idol group.

1765
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:18,810
Tempugumi Inc.

1766
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:22,370
They announced that they were disbanding.

1767
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:23,350
They're ending.

1768
01:40:23,870 --> 01:40:25,450
They were ending their story.

1769
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:27,990
They announced that.

1770
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:31,390
And so I was like, I must go see them.

1771
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:33,150
One last time.

1772
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:36,570
And what was so cute is...

1773
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:40,970
You know, things you don't really see if you don't get to go to the venue.

1774
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:44,850
Which is like, outside the...

1775
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:47,390
It was at Makuhari Messe, which is pretty big.

1776
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:50,450
But what I love about that venue the most is that...

1777
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:53,370
It's big, but the inside is very small.

1778
01:40:53,370 --> 01:40:55,950
So no seat is a bad seat.

1779
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:57,870
Like, it's so easy to see.

1780
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:59,370
And the stage is very high.

1781
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:01,370
It's very easy to...

1782
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:05,230
Thanks for all the 07s.

1783
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:07,750
It's very easy to see.

1784
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:10,710
And so, it was the clearest...

1785
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:14,270
Well, it was like one of the clearest concerts I've ever seen.

1786
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:15,150
It was so great.

1787
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:19,270
But some of the fun things you don't get to see is like...

1788
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:22,510
Outside, they had like a big...

1789
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:24,010
It felt like a festival.

1790
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:28,050
Like, they had a shooting game where you can shoot and get prizes.

1791
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:30,470
And they had like...

1792
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:34,410
One where you pull a string and get prizes.

1793
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:39,850
Just awesome.

1794
01:41:43,010 --> 01:41:45,310
It felt really cool to see.

1795
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:47,330
And they also had omikuji.

1796
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:49,230
They also had fortune readings there too.

1797
01:41:49,230 --> 01:41:51,970
And so, I...

1798
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:52,850
Pulled it.

1799
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:56,250
Should've gone to the Furude Shrine in Hinamizawa.

1800
01:41:57,330 --> 01:41:58,710
That would've cured my sickness.

1801
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:09,530
I pulled my fortune there.

1802
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:13,410
And instead, I got normal luck!

1803
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:15,710
I got normal luck.

1804
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:18,170
So...

1805
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:19,170
I...

1806
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,370
I replaced my...

1807
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:23,590
My coming luck with the normal luck.

1808
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:25,590
Because my oshi...

1809
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:27,970
My oshi said I have normal luck.

1810
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:35,850
Kitty.

1811
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:44,170
Thank you for the Pettikitten!

1812
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,440
Welcome back.

1813
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,000
Thank you!

1814
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,600
But yeah, the concert itself was so, so great.

1815
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,380
I was really...

1816
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:07,440
I'm really glad because both days I had...

1817
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:10,400
Really nice seats and...

1818
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:14,820
I wasn't like close to the front or anything, but sometimes it's like...

1819
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:16,400
Really nice not being...

1820
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:19,540
So close to the front of a...

1821
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:23,480
To...

1822
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,660
The stage, because you kind of get to...

1823
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:28,400
Have the atmosphere...

1824
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,340
Of the stadium, you know?

1825
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:32,440
And everything like that.

1826
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,940
This time we welcome back the main, not the other way around.

1827
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:43,400
So, it's kind of...

1828
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:46,360
Fun to be like in the middle of it all and get to see...

1829
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:47,520
Because I...

1830
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,780
I honestly have not been to very many like...

1831
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:51,980
Big, big concerts.

1832
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:55,280
Many of the concerts that I've been to have been like...

1833
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,500
You know, I follow a lot of smaller idols.

1834
01:43:59,280 --> 01:43:59,680
Or...

1835
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:01,400
You know, I just couldn't...

1836
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:03,480
Until like...

1837
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,600
Until COVID.

1838
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:07,420
Until I became a Vtuber, I couldn't really afford it.

1839
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:08,540
And so...

1840
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:13,540
Like, the Japan travels and everything.

1841
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:19,260
So then obviously during COVID, I couldn't go because there was no way to go.

1842
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:20,480
And so...

1843
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:22,820
You know.

1844
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:29,820
Normal person, thank you for the 50 gifted, thank you.

1845
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,640
Thank you so much.

1846
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:38,500
Thank you.

1847
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:39,940
Thank you, thank you.

1848
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:45,620
You performed in a few big concerts, but nothing like, you know...

1849
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:46,700
Like a...

1850
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,600
Stadium size or anything like that.

1851
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,480
Event hall size.

1852
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:56,380
So...

1853
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:59,760
Yeah, it's just...

1854
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:09,340
I haven't really... I guess I haven't really processed it, I think.

1855
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:12,760
Because I...

1856
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:14,040
I don't know.

1857
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,100
I'm waiting for my breakdown moment.

1858
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:23,060
Because I cried a lot during the show, but...

1859
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:27,180
Obviously, I didn't want to break down crying because I...

1860
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:29,060
Didn't want to like, just miss...

1861
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,080
What was going on.

1862
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:34,860
It was so fun, it was still in the moment.

1863
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:40,060
And then every time I wanted to cry, I would be like...

1864
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:46,040
Like in a car or on a train in front of people.

1865
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:46,220
It was so cool.

1866
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:53,440
It'll hit you when you least expect it, maybe.

1867
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:57,220
And it was just a lot, because it was like...

1868
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:00,060
I watched...

1869
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,040
I watched...

1870
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:05,620
Fana's graduation.

1871
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,040
The same morning of...

1872
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:12,040
So I was like...

1873
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:12,900
It was a...

1874
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:17,420
Very...

1875
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:19,720
Emotional time for me.

1876
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:24,700
The combo sounds rough.

1877
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:29,560
I think I'm... I think I'm feeling a little numb about it right now.

1878
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:35,100
Just, it's one of those like, defense mechanisms, maybe.

1879
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:40,720
The Narissa call-in was rough.

1880
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:42,540
But...

1881
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:51,580
I worry for people, because...

1882
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:55,180
You know, I don't want people to be like...

1883
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:58,580
I don't want to be into VTubers anymore, because...

1884
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:02,580
You know, it's kind of similar with idols, it's just like they just...

1885
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,360
I get too invested and then they're gone.

1886
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,690
But it's still...

1887
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,580
You should still...

1888
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:12,600
Still...

1889
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,660
Have fun with it while you can, you know.

1890
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:23,340
You know.

1891
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,100
Everything in life goes away.

1892
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,280
So true.

1893
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,540
After life too, apparently.

1894
01:47:36,620 --> 01:47:39,480
Since my idol groups, my idols are leaving me also.

1895
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:50,030
But...

1896
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:50,830
But...

1897
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:52,290
Yeah, the concert was just so-so.

1898
01:47:52,430 --> 01:47:55,550
I'm really... I'm just really grateful that...

1899
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:57,510
I was able to go at all, so...

1900
01:47:57,510 --> 01:48:02,050
And I'm only really able... I was only really able to go because of you guys, so...

1901
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:04,410
Thank you, I do really, really appreciate it.

1902
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:09,630
That I was able to experience that moment.

1903
01:48:10,470 --> 01:48:12,350
Because of you guys, so thank you.

1904
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:19,150
You can cry now, man.

1905
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:21,690
You just want to hear me cry, right, you freak?

1906
01:48:22,150 --> 01:48:23,430
You just want to hear me cry.

1907
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:31,700
I don't want to cry right now.

1908
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,600
Cry, cry, cry.

1909
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,240
Cry, Vtuber, cry.

1910
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:45,680
But other than that, the show, the live was two days.

1911
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:49,500
I didn't really do much.

1912
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:56,000
I really didn't do much, because I was like...

1913
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,120
I got sick.

1914
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:03,900
I didn't want to go so many places, because it was cold and I was sick.

1915
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:07,960
And I was just trying to rest up for...

1916
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:09,680
For the concert.

1917
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:13,540
And the concert happened in two days, and then I went home.

1918
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:19,940
My friend is a sapling.

1919
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:24,240
I dealt with the graduation last year, so I tried to help him as best as I could.

1920
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,460
Aww, you're a good friend.

1921
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:32,720
It's like times like this when...

1922
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:36,140
Everybody is here for each other, you know.

1923
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:39,220
We've had a heck of a 2025.

1924
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:42,240
Already, I know, we're only eight days in.

1925
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:45,320
Nine for some of you, maybe.

1926
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,920
We're only a week in.

1927
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:50,320
And I've already...

1928
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,800
I've already... I'm at my limit.

1929
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:58,660
I'm at my limit.

1930
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:02,680
It's okay, you watched TF1.

1931
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:03,600
That's what counts.

1932
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:07,200
I'm so glad that... I'm so happy my plane had it.

1933
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:09,260
I watched that.

1934
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,580
I watched a movie called The Fall Guy.

1935
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:14,940
Which had Ryan Reynolds in it.

1936
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:19,180
It was about... I don't know, it was just like, fall guys.

1937
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:24,580
But it was about a guy that does stunt...

1938
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:27,520
Gosling!

1939
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:29,140
Oh my god!

1940
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:36,420
Ryan Gosling in it!

1941
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:56,750
Wait, what do you mean they gaslit me hard?

1942
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:59,350
Wait, am I... Hold on, I'm gonna look it up.

1943
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:00,670
Wait, it is...

1944
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,140
Are you guys gaslighting me?

1945
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:11,000
Was Ryan Reynolds actually all along?

1946
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:14,100
It's Reynolds.

1947
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:14,420
Wait.

1948
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,040
Hold on, I'm gonna look it up.

1949
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:18,680
The Fall Guy.

1950
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:24,600
Guy.

1951
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:26,280
I put the fall gut.

1952
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:30,360
What?

1953
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:32,100
Gosling!

1954
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:33,900
See, I was right!

1955
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:35,880
I was right!

1956
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,460
Gosh, you guys gaslighting me.

1957
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:45,960
You guys said... The other one.

1958
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:52,340
No, you said Reynolds.

1959
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:53,760
No, you're gaslighting me.

1960
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:54,540
You're gaslighting me.

1961
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:55,380
You're gaslighting me.

1962
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:57,580
Who said Reynolds first?

1963
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,640
Oh wait, yeah I did.

1964
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:04,240
And then you guys said it was...

1965
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:05,180
Wait,

1966
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:13,560
I said it was Gosling and then you guys said it was Reynolds.

1967
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:14,220
No, sorry.

1968
01:52:14,380 --> 01:52:14,600
Hold on.

1969
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:19,280
I said it was Gosling.

1970
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:19,780
No!

1971
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,620
I said it was Reynolds and you said it was Gosling.

1972
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:37,370
Gosling.

1973
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:41,170
I wonder if I could get a shoutout for my dog, Mr. Sweaters.

1974
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:43,390
Mr. Sweaters!

1975
01:52:44,370 --> 01:52:46,310
I mean to hear you give a proper goodbye.

1976
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:50,170
Sorry about your dog, Rodrigo.

1977
01:52:50,810 --> 01:52:56,530
No, Mr. Sweaters sounds such a cute name.

1978
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:00,190
That's such a cute name.

1979
01:53:00,230 --> 01:53:00,950
Oh my gosh.

1980
01:53:02,530 --> 01:53:04,030
Thank you for another 50.

1981
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:04,890
Thank you!

1982
01:53:06,030 --> 01:53:07,190
Thank you so much.

1983
01:53:09,490 --> 01:53:11,530
I really appreciate it.

1984
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:17,910
Mr. Sweaters.

1985
01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:21,530
Oh no, this music is kind of...

1986
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,240
Wait, what do you mean?

1987
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:30,980
Fall guy has Gosling, free guy has 2021.

1988
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:33,800
Wait, free guy 2021 has Reynolds.

1989
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:35,800
Why did they do this to me?

1990
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:37,640
We all mix up names.

1991
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:39,860
Don't feel too bad about it, Enya.

1992
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:44,360
Thank you for another 50, you horrible person.

1993
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:45,260
What the hell?

1994
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:46,820
Thank you so much.

1995
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,440
Another 50?

1996
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:52,940
Are you okay?

1997
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:16,580
Thank you.

1998
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,040
Thank you so much.

1999
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,220
Okay, so thank you for the thank you.

2000
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,380
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2001
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:37,980
But yeah, I watched the fall guy.

2002
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:39,900
That was cute.

2003
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:41,180
I liked it.

2004
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:42,020
I thought it was pretty cute.

2005
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,560
And then I watched Transformers.

2006
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:49,000
I literally, I started Joker 2.

2007
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:53,800
I think I got like 5 minutes into it.

2008
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:56,500
I was like...

2009
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:04,220
I don't know.

2010
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:07,540
I didn't watch it.

2011
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:11,080
I feel like there was something else I watched and I don't remember what it was.

2012
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:13,920
Joker.

2013
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:16,800
The correct choice.

2014
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,820
But the juggler.

2015
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:21,860
It's kind of wack to be honest.

2016
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:28,480
I heard that like the guy who made the original Joker really doesn't like the original Joker.

2017
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:32,060
And so Joker 2 kind of retcons a bunch of stuff.

2018
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,560
From what I've heard.

2019
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:41,380
I don't know if that's like a true thing.

2020
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:47,720
He's mad that people idolize the Joker.

2021
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:49,240
I don't know.

2022
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:56,580
He doesn't like Joker fans.

2023
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:00,900
That's so silly.

2024
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,840
Thank you!

2025
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,620
He killed it for the fans.

2026
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:21,510
Blue Destiny, why are all your O's?

2027
01:56:21,670 --> 01:56:22,890
Did your O key break?

2028
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:32,510
I liked the first Joker though.

2029
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:35,470
I think that...

2030
01:56:39,130 --> 01:56:39,690
Like...

2031
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:41,930
I think he was a very...

2032
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:43,890
You know, sympathetic character.

2033
01:56:47,890 --> 01:56:50,930
Kind of like one of those movies where it's just like...

2034
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:57,390
Some people are born bad, but when they're pushed to their limits, you know.

2035
01:56:59,290 --> 01:56:59,750
Situations.

2036
01:57:01,890 --> 01:57:04,830
If Mint has become the Joker, does that mean the director hates us also?

2037
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:09,510
I'm not the Joker yet.

2038
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:11,010
I'm not the Joker yet.

2039
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:13,190
I will become the Joker one day.

2040
01:57:13,190 --> 01:57:13,330
Thank you.

2041
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:17,930
You know who is also a sympathetic character?

2042
01:57:18,290 --> 01:57:18,850
Megatron.

2043
01:57:20,990 --> 01:57:22,030
Less so!

2044
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:23,370
Less so!

2045
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:25,270
That guy kind of turned into an asshole.

2046
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:27,350
Did I like it?

2047
01:57:27,670 --> 01:57:27,950
Yeah.

2048
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:29,630
Did I like him as an asshole?

2049
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:30,970
Obviously.

2050
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:35,950
But...

2051
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:38,190
That guy...

2052
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:43,690
Literally, it just... Someone needed to tell him to chill out.

2053
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:50,940
But he was kind of awesome.

2054
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:56,560
He was the only one who stood up against Suspicious Prime.

2055
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:04,010
He was like, I'm gonna get my ass whooped for this, but I don't care.

2056
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:15,460
Orion told him to chill out at the Noah.

2057
01:58:24,610 --> 01:58:25,610
What's the thumbnail?

2058
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:28,610
It's Ear of the Snake, baby!

2059
01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:35,230
Still need to watch Transformers 1.

2060
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:36,090
It's so good.

2061
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:39,510
I didn't know it was animated.

2062
01:58:40,270 --> 01:58:42,010
I thought it was a live action.

2063
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:43,570
Stupid silly.

2064
01:58:44,090 --> 01:58:45,970
But it's animated so well.

2065
01:58:46,050 --> 01:58:47,030
It looks so good.

2066
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:50,610
It looks so good and the characters are very fun and lovable.

2067
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:53,350
And...

2068
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:56,210
All around, I think it's really good.

2069
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:03,530
TF1 watch-along?

2070
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:04,650
Maybe.

2071
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:08,130
I saw a comment recently.

2072
01:59:08,330 --> 01:59:11,090
I'm not getting one guide or anything, but I did see a comment from someone.

2073
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:17,550
I was like, I wish Minto would do watch-alongs of things she hasn't seen before.

2074
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:21,910
Since I, you know, I think I did Indiana Jones before.

2075
01:59:22,910 --> 01:59:26,270
And then I, you know, I've already seen those movies.

2076
01:59:27,890 --> 01:59:28,450
So...

2077
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:35,170
That got me thinking maybe I should do more that are things that I haven't seen.

2078
01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:38,790
Thumbnail of Phantom Namia.

2079
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,000
Goonies next?

2080
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:49,480
I have not seen the Goonies.

2081
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:52,180
Twilight, I've seen Twilight though.

2082
01:59:54,780 --> 01:59:56,880
Ignore that guy, I want Beast Wars watch-along.

2083
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:03,400
Okay, but it's been a long enough time from Beast Wars that I think if I watch it now...

2084
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:05,140
Like I remember certain things.

2085
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:20,070
Typically, it's like I remember a storyline of something, but I can't remember such specific parts.

2086
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:21,450
So it would still be like...

2087
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:23,350
To me, you know what I mean?

2088
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:25,970
I haven't watched Sonic 3 yet.

2089
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:28,110
I haven't even watched Sonic 2 yet.

2090
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:31,870
No, you guys can have my...

2091
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:33,030
You can come for my throat!

2092
02:00:34,790 --> 02:00:35,490
Take it!

2093
02:00:43,610 --> 02:00:44,690
No, you're sick?

2094
02:00:44,890 --> 02:00:45,170
Okay.

2095
02:00:57,540 --> 02:00:59,420
I don't want your ghost germs.

2096
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:04,060
Hold on, coughing baby.

2097
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:09,340
Spider-Man watch-along.

2098
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:12,760
Wait, I kind of want to watch original Spider-Man though.

2099
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:15,700
Well, you know, like...

2100
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:18,540
Peter Park...

2101
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:22,500
What's his name?

2102
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:23,660
Tobey Maguire!

2103
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:27,680
You know what I really love?

2104
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:29,400
Quoting is...

2105
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:32,580
That one in Spider-Man 3 when he's like...

2106
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:34,340
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2107
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:38,860
Have you guys seen that edit where it's only him going...

2108
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:40,940
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2109
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:46,640
I love that edit so much!

2110
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,020
Why are you writing Orion Gosling?

2111
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:53,220
Mint is suffering from Lumbago.

2112
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:54,500
What's that?

2113
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:58,240
Bully Maguire.

2114
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:01,300
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2115
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:06,920
My only problem with watch-along is that I'm at work unless it's Thursday or Sunday.

2116
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:08,400
So I have to VOD them.

2117
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:10,740
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2118
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:19,360
That does sound like your problem.

2119
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:19,540
My problem.

2120
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:30,540
Wait, do you guys know what I'm talking about?

2121
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:31,040
Seriously.

2122
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:32,900
Do I have to pull up this clip?

2123
02:02:40,310 --> 02:02:40,730
No?

2124
02:02:41,010 --> 02:02:41,430
Okay, okay.

2125
02:02:43,150 --> 02:02:44,190
Can I watch it anyway?

2126
02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:47,130
Can we watch it anyway?

2127
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:55,310
Can we watch it again?

2128
02:02:57,050 --> 02:02:57,790
Who am I?

2129
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:00,890
Wait!

2130
02:03:02,510 --> 02:03:03,470
You guys, did you hear?

2131
02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:04,730
I got a new keyboard.

2132
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:07,310
Okay, are you ready for...

2133
02:03:07,310 --> 02:03:12,230
Are you ready for real creamy keyboard action?

2134
02:03:12,850 --> 02:03:13,770
Are you ready for this?

2135
02:03:15,250 --> 02:03:18,710
I'm just gonna write... I miss the part where that's my problem.

2136
02:03:21,110 --> 02:03:22,270
I'm moving my mic.

2137
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:20,850
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2138
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:24,990
Stop playing with rocks.

2139
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:28,350
Mr. Krabwalking sound effect.

2140
02:04:29,890 --> 02:04:31,270
Maybe that's a good thing.

2141
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:32,290
Can that be your tissue?

2142
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:33,330
Snake!

2143
02:04:33,730 --> 02:04:34,910
You can always be my tissue.

2144
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:36,690
Here, let me blow my nose.

2145
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:54,240
Only one of my nostrils is...

2146
02:04:58,520 --> 02:04:59,980
is stuffy right now.

2147
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:05,400
Okay, let's watch the part where that's my problem.

2148
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,480
I love this video.

2149
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:10,240
I love this video, it's so funny.

2150
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,400
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2151
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:33,270
That should be good.

2152
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:36,090
Oh, I think I missed a little bit off the top.

2153
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:39,090
There we go.

2154
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:40,590
Okay, okay.

2155
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:41,830
Let's watch.

2156
02:05:57,350 --> 02:06:01,630
Yeah, whatever.

2157
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:11,050
Okay.

2158
02:06:22,390 --> 02:06:23,870
He's such an asshole.

2159
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:37,470
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2160
02:06:39,090 --> 02:06:39,730
Great power.

2161
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:47,390
It's so sad.

2162
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,660
It's not even there.

2163
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:01,620
In spite of everything you've done for them.

2164
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:04,320
Eventually they will hate you, my father.

2165
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:07,580
Because I miss the part where that's my problem.

2166
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,260
Wrong answer!

2167
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:10,840
See ya, chump.

2168
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:17,340
Oh my god, this is seven minutes long!

2169
02:07:19,380 --> 02:07:21,200
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2170
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:29,120
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2171
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:44,140
I have your little girlfriend and some children here.

2172
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:45,960
Save them if you can.

2173
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:47,820
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2174
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:52,260
He's such an asshole.

2175
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:56,400
Peter Parker if he stayed in his own way.

2176
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,440
It's so good.

2177
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:09,440
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2178
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:15,180
All the times you miss the part where that's your problem...

2179
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:15,900
make me sad.

2180
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:19,240
I thought you'd learn the meaning of responsibility.

2181
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:27,520
All the parts where you miss the part where that's your problem...

2182
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:29,400
make me sad.

2183
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:35,060
Bully McGuire strikes again.

2184
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:37,560
Oh gosh!

2185
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:41,640
That's so funny.

2186
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:44,520
Such a good edit.

2187
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:50,200
Just look up Spider-Man Trilogy but he always missed the part where that's his problem.

2188
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:51,740
You'll find the video.

2189
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:53,120
It's so funny.

2190
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:56,080
Can you play it again?

2191
02:08:56,240 --> 02:08:58,480
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2192
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:01,620
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2193
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:06,440
That's good.

2194
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:08,360
That's good.

2195
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:11,680
That's good.

2196
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:14,640
That's so good.

2197
02:09:15,460 --> 02:09:17,200
I miss the part where that's my problem.

2198
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:22,500
Okay guys.

2199
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:33,020
There's one more thing I wanted to do tonight.

2200
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:36,200
And that's what I want to do is...

2201
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:39,560
I want to make my 2025...

2202
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:42,640
Why do I say it like that?

2203
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:48,140
My 2025 resolutions.

2204
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:54,160
If you hold your breath until your brain goes into panic mode, you can temporarily force your sinuses to clear themselves.

2205
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:57,960
I don't...

2206
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,960
I don't think that's healthy.

2207
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:09,840
Don't think you should do that.

2208
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:12,460
I mean, I don't have to breathe.

2209
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:13,080
I'm a ghost.

2210
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:15,840
I just do it to sound more natural.

2211
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:17,820
You know, to not freak you guys out.

2212
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:19,240
Like this.

2213
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:24,080
That's all, you know, sound like I was...

2214
02:10:24,660 --> 02:10:26,040
Can someone reverse that?

2215
02:10:26,100 --> 02:10:27,080
What did I say in reverse?

2216
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:33,480
Can someone...

2217
02:10:33,480 --> 02:10:35,840
It sounded like I just talked in reverse.

2218
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:36,020
I just...

2219
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:43,680
I missed the part where that's my problem.

2220
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:50,520
Gives yourself a panic attack to fix a minor inconvenience.

2221
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:01,180
What did I just say just then?

2222
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:12,420
Something dirty.

2223
02:11:13,940 --> 02:11:14,500
Dirty.

2224
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:23,800
Oh wait, let's see if I can actually say I missed the part where that's my problem.

2225
02:11:23,940 --> 02:11:24,540
Okay, hold on.

2226
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:26,320
Let me type it out.

2227
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:30,120
I missed the part where that's my problem.

2228
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:56,640
M-E-L-B-O-R-B M-Y-S-T-A-H-T E-R-E-H-W T-R-A-P E-H-T D-E-S-S-I-M I.

2229
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,080
Okay.

2230
02:11:57,680 --> 02:11:58,400
Okay.

2231
02:11:58,920 --> 02:11:59,240
Okay.

2232
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:01,620
Someone play this back forward, okay?

2233
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,420
Someone play this back forward.

2234
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:17,440
M-E-L-B-O-R-B S-T-A-T-B-E-R-O T-R-A-P-E-P-T Wait, hold on.

2235
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:18,160
Redo!

2236
02:12:23,550 --> 02:12:24,190
Redo!

2237
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:30,530
Redo!

2238
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:42,510
Okay, hold on.

2239
02:12:42,650 --> 02:12:42,870
Hold on.

2240
02:12:43,050 --> 02:12:44,470
Let me get, like, the T-H.

2241
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,020
Okay, let me put, like, the T-H's.

2242
02:12:56,110 --> 02:12:56,470
Okay.

2243
02:12:58,150 --> 02:12:58,750
Okay, alright.

2244
02:12:58,790 --> 02:12:59,330
Let's try again.

2245
02:12:59,410 --> 02:12:59,830
Let's try again.

2246
02:13:00,370 --> 02:13:00,570
Okay.

2247
02:13:02,170 --> 02:13:14,030
M-E-L-B-O-R-B S-T-A-T-B-E-R-O T-R-A-P-E-P-T D-E-S-S-I-M-I Okay.

2248
02:13:15,890 --> 02:13:17,550
Okay, you have it.

2249
02:13:17,890 --> 02:13:18,710
You have it.

2250
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:20,430
Tell me what I said.

2251
02:13:22,590 --> 02:13:24,310
Tell me what I said.

2252
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:29,080
Tell me if I got it right.

2253
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:35,080
What?

2254
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:45,000
Okay.

2255
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:47,200
Alright.

2256
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:56,840
I can't.

2257
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:57,320
I can't.

2258
02:13:57,380 --> 02:13:58,340
I love it, though.

2259
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:01,000
Strange New Year's Resolution.

2260
02:14:01,140 --> 02:14:01,380
No!

2261
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:02,420
A New Year's Resolution!

2262
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:05,480
2025 goals!

2263
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:21,360
I missed the clip where that's Mint's problem.

2264
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:26,760
Okay.

2265
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:28,020
I think...

2266
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:30,280
I'm on the first one.

2267
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:34,320
Would an OG song be a good goal?

2268
02:14:34,440 --> 02:14:37,640
That's actually what I have written literally right here.

2269
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:41,720
Release an original song.

2270
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:44,760
I want to do that this year.

2271
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:46,780
What's in my face?

2272
02:14:49,340 --> 02:14:52,100
I want to release an original song this year.

2273
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,640
I want to.

2274
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:58,060
I want to.

2275
02:14:58,240 --> 02:14:58,900
You have one.

2276
02:14:59,660 --> 02:14:59,900
No.

2277
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:01,420
No.

2278
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:03,560
Not yet.

2279
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:04,980
But I will.

2280
02:15:05,680 --> 02:15:06,280
I will.

2281
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:06,820
I will.

2282
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:09,760
Yeah.

2283
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:14,260
I actually have been in the talks with a...

2284
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:16,100
With a...

2285
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:16,600
Someone.

2286
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:21,040
About an original song.

2287
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:25,100
So...

2288
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:26,740
Maybe.

2289
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:28,140
Sooner than you think.

2290
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:30,480
Perhaps.

2291
02:15:32,300 --> 02:15:32,740
Maybe.

2292
02:15:39,710 --> 02:15:40,690
Yes.

2293
02:15:41,650 --> 02:15:42,870
Secret, secret.

2294
02:15:43,330 --> 02:15:44,930
Going along with that though.

2295
02:15:45,970 --> 02:15:47,850
Going along with this though.

2296
02:15:49,630 --> 02:15:52,190
I also want to finally get voice lessons.

2297
02:15:52,790 --> 02:15:54,410
I've been talking about it!

2298
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:56,310
For as...

2299
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:58,010
For so long.

2300
02:15:58,790 --> 02:16:00,910
I want to finally...

2301
02:16:00,910 --> 02:16:03,790
Go do voice lessons and like...

2302
02:16:03,790 --> 02:16:06,310
Properly retrain my voice and everything.

2303
02:16:07,330 --> 02:16:09,230
I'm really determined about that.

2304
02:16:09,230 --> 02:16:11,210
I have to find a good voice teacher.

2305
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:15,950
Let me know.

2306
02:16:16,050 --> 02:16:17,690
I hope all your 2025 dreams come true.

2307
02:16:18,030 --> 02:16:18,850
Thank you!

2308
02:16:20,010 --> 02:16:21,170
You have something on your nose?

2309
02:16:23,190 --> 02:16:23,670
Where?

2310
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:27,490
Oh, now you acknowledge my nose, huh?

2311
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:29,870
Now you acknowledge my nose, huh?

2312
02:16:31,570 --> 02:16:34,870
You never wanted to acknowledge my nose before, but now...

2313
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:36,550
Oh, now it's fine.

2314
02:16:56,750 --> 02:17:00,650
Problem, that's my that's where part the mist eye.

2315
02:17:06,230 --> 02:17:10,510
My, oh my gosh, I got a new camera, but I don't think it's very good.

2316
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:12,950
I keep like...

2317
02:17:12,950 --> 02:17:14,750
Can we get a close up nose pic?

2318
02:17:15,130 --> 02:17:15,510
Sure.

2319
02:17:23,810 --> 02:17:24,290
Nose!

2320
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:24,890
Nose!

2321
02:17:26,570 --> 02:17:30,770
Oh my gosh, if you only see the arrow, it looks like I'm Avatar the Last Airbender.

2322
02:17:32,390 --> 02:17:34,130
I'm Avatar the Last Airbender.

2323
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:43,800
Thank god one guy didn't believe he had a nose.

2324
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:44,160
No!

2325
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:48,080
I was, you guys, I was right.

2326
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:49,320
You were right.

2327
02:17:50,100 --> 02:17:50,980
About Ryan.

2328
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:52,420
And Ryan.

2329
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:56,240
Mr. Ryan.

2330
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:59,380
2025 Mint performs at Budokan.

2331
02:18:00,860 --> 02:18:05,620
Okay, let's aim for some realistic stuff here now, okay?

2332
02:18:07,540 --> 02:18:11,580
Let's aim for things that are doable.

2333
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:12,740
Maybe.

2334
02:18:14,940 --> 02:18:15,800
Perhaps.

2335
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:25,420
Wait, they have hearts in their eyes.

2336
02:18:26,420 --> 02:18:28,400
This is how my eyes have always looked.

2337
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:38,320
They like?

2338
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:55,430
Can wisps get jetpacks?

2339
02:18:55,570 --> 02:18:57,070
You guys don't need them though.

2340
02:18:57,910 --> 02:18:58,770
My hat!

2341
02:19:04,310 --> 02:19:06,450
You guys don't need jetpacks.

2342
02:19:06,670 --> 02:19:08,870
Literally, wisps are like floating around.

2343
02:19:10,730 --> 02:19:12,670
You have a built-in jetpack.

2344
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:19,020
It's funny though, because...

2345
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:23,820
I know your name, like you guys are wisps and all, but I never think of you as dead.

2346
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:26,360
I don't think you guys are dead, truly.

2347
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:30,560
Because...

2348
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:34,500
I don't want you guys to...

2349
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:39,980
I don't want you guys to become spirits.

2350
02:19:40,660 --> 02:19:42,740
I don't want you guys to become ghosts.

2351
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:50,700
You only become a ghost when you have regret, you know?

2352
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:55,380
I want you guys to have a very happy and fulfilling life.

2353
02:19:57,140 --> 02:19:59,180
So you don't have to become a ghost.

2354
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:01,220
You don't have to become a wisp.

2355
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:08,040
So...

2356
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:11,880
So I never think of you guys as dead.

2357
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:15,420
She's ghost keeping.

2358
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:23,620
We didn't have to die.

2359
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:26,320
Well, that's what a wisp is.

2360
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:29,640
Minto, you have to let us go.

2361
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:30,360
Blah blah blah.

2362
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:31,240
Accident blah.

2363
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:32,520
Ten years ago blah blah blah.

2364
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:33,040
Blah blah blah.

2365
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:42,900
How could we go see a ghost in a cafe if we're not dead?

2366
02:20:43,360 --> 02:20:44,840
You have a sixth sense.

2367
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,560
I see dead people.

2368
02:20:50,700 --> 02:20:53,600
But you're not that guy because he sucks.

2369
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:03,160
I regret not going to your concert.

2370
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:04,120
Can I be a ghost now?

2371
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:04,560
No!

2372
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:08,840
Nope.

2373
02:21:11,620 --> 02:21:12,980
Sixth sense?

2374
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:15,600
You have enough to buy a gumball.

2375
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:18,480
Neither alive nor truly dead.

2376
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,240
I regret not having a jetpack.

2377
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:28,920
Why did you...

2378
02:21:34,150 --> 02:21:36,510
Will that be what makes you happy?

2379
02:21:37,050 --> 02:21:37,930
A jetpack?

2380
02:21:39,130 --> 02:21:41,370
Will that truly solve all your problems?

2381
02:21:42,270 --> 02:21:45,610
After Minto returned, wisps were taken from the battle.

2382
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:48,530
Neither truly alive nor truly dead.

2383
02:21:48,930 --> 02:21:51,410
Undying shadows and a world of lights.

2384
02:21:51,750 --> 02:21:54,250
Now in front of you, I can finally die.

2385
02:21:55,570 --> 02:21:57,370
Not all, but some.

2386
02:21:58,310 --> 02:21:59,850
Coast keep girl boss.

2387
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:12,150
I think if you get a jetpack you'll actually become a wisp.

2388
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:15,810
I don't trust you guys.

2389
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:24,350
I don't think I trust you guys with one.

2390
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:27,570
First you have to go to jetpack training school.

2391
02:22:28,030 --> 02:22:31,090
Show me your certificate and then you can get a jetpack, okay?

2392
02:22:34,330 --> 02:22:37,430
I was always trying to show my friend your singing, but he AFKed.

2393
02:22:38,170 --> 02:22:40,850
But he'd be AFK at the good parts.

2394
02:22:41,330 --> 02:22:44,130
But then he caught your concert at Anime North and loved it.

2395
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:45,370
Anime North?

2396
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:46,610
Wait, that's a truck, right?

2397
02:22:47,530 --> 02:22:47,930
Yay!

2398
02:22:48,350 --> 02:22:49,370
I'm glad he liked it.

2399
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:53,330
Thank you.

2400
02:22:57,790 --> 02:22:59,010
The parking lot one.

2401
02:23:02,330 --> 02:23:03,030
Jetpack school?

2402
02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:04,850
I missed the part where that was my problem.

2403
02:23:08,030 --> 02:23:09,350
You want a jetpack?

2404
02:23:09,530 --> 02:23:10,710
Two can play that game.

2405
02:23:10,970 --> 02:23:11,710
You want a jetpack?

2406
02:23:12,010 --> 02:23:13,490
I missed the part where that was my problem.

2407
02:23:20,290 --> 02:23:21,030
Let's see.

2408
02:23:22,270 --> 02:23:29,930
My third goal for 2025 is to organize a big event.

2409
02:23:32,150 --> 02:23:32,670
Event.

2410
02:23:33,130 --> 02:23:34,270
Maybe more than one.

2411
02:23:34,270 --> 02:23:35,330
I want to at least do one.

2412
02:23:37,210 --> 02:23:44,070
Maybe like a big tournament or a karaoke thing.

2413
02:23:46,690 --> 02:23:48,130
Or something.

2414
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:50,030
I want to organize a big event.

2415
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:55,430
Some sort of thing involving a bunch of other Vtubers.

2416
02:23:58,510 --> 02:24:00,970
I was thinking about it earlier.

2417
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:03,170
I was just like...

2418
02:24:03,790 --> 02:24:05,190
You know, like...

2419
02:24:06,830 --> 02:24:12,710
I'm not into Marvel Rivals, which is the hot stuff right now.

2420
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:15,870
And it makes me sad because I want to collab with people.

2421
02:24:16,050 --> 02:24:19,010
But everyone's playing it and I have no interest.

2422
02:24:19,910 --> 02:24:24,290
And I kind of hope that hopefully soon there will be a new game.

2423
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:27,450
Like a new Among Us or a new Lethal Company.

2424
02:24:27,730 --> 02:24:28,410
That comes out.

2425
02:24:28,450 --> 02:24:29,730
I was watching...

2426
02:24:29,730 --> 02:24:30,690
Sorry.

2427
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:33,790
Just earlier I was watching someone play...

2428
02:24:33,790 --> 02:24:38,390
I think it was an old, old VOD from years ago of someone playing Among Us.

2429
02:24:38,430 --> 02:24:40,790
And I was just like...

2430
02:24:41,510 --> 02:24:42,570
I'll miss this.

2431
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:51,630
Lockdown protocol.

2432
02:24:51,850 --> 02:24:54,130
But even then I think...

2433
02:24:54,130 --> 02:24:56,030
It's not as popular anymore.

2434
02:24:56,030 --> 02:24:57,410
You know.

2435
02:25:08,670 --> 02:25:10,050
Wipes your nose, milady.

2436
02:25:10,170 --> 02:25:11,030
Oh, thank you, Indy.

2437
02:25:14,090 --> 02:25:15,990
Some people are getting back into Lethal.

2438
02:25:16,390 --> 02:25:17,510
Maybe, hopefully.

2439
02:25:18,690 --> 02:25:22,050
I was like, man, I want to have games like this again.

2440
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:22,410
They're fun.

2441
02:25:22,490 --> 02:25:25,150
But also it's hard for me to ask people for collabs.

2442
02:25:25,150 --> 02:25:28,230
So it's Fortnite, Miku collab.

2443
02:25:28,530 --> 02:25:29,810
Oh boy, baby.

2444
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:37,430
So...

2445
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:42,180
I don't know.

2446
02:25:43,080 --> 02:25:44,640
But I want to organize something big.

2447
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:47,520
I've been brainstorming.

2448
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:48,240
Something.

2449
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:49,740
Something, maybe.

2450
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:53,260
Something, something.

2451
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:55,480
Yeah.

2452
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:57,320
My next goal...

2453
02:25:57,320 --> 02:25:59,540
This one might... I don't know if this one will be possible.

2454
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,200
I know we just reached 300k.

2455
02:26:05,180 --> 02:26:09,260
But I want to reach 444... 444...

2456
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:10,780
K.

2457
02:26:11,080 --> 02:26:11,980
Wait, not K.

2458
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:13,260
Wait, get to 4...

2459
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:18,820
Get to 4444 subscribers.

2460
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,360
Subscribers.

2461
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:24,920
Speaking of...

2462
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:29,560
444...

2463
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:32,200
Wait, how much do I have?

2464
02:26:32,920 --> 02:26:34,000
It's a 3, right?

2465
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:36,140
If I added one more, it would be a million.

2466
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:42,020
444... 444...

2467
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:44,060
I don't know if it will be possible.

2468
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:45,300
It might be, you know...

2469
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:46,780
But we can aim for it.

2470
02:26:46,980 --> 02:26:47,820
I'll do my best.

2471
02:26:50,060 --> 02:26:50,620
Alright.

2472
02:26:55,660 --> 02:26:56,220
44444444444...

2473
02:26:56,220 --> 02:26:58,980
Clatka is a pretty fun Lethal Company-like game.

2474
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:00,820
It's in early access right now.

2475
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:02,300
Let me type that up.

2476
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:03,240
Let me look it up later.

2477
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:04,580
Thank you.

2478
02:27:08,540 --> 02:27:10,820
444... Why did I reach 666666?

2479
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:15,380
Because I don't think that's possible in 2025.

2480
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:53,160
I will work hard to be more fun.

2481
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:59,120
And have more people want to subscribe to me.

2482
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:10,080
They just have to hate us even more.

2483
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:13,020
Even more than I already do?

2484
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:14,840
I don't know if that's possible.

2485
02:28:21,380 --> 02:28:23,420
Wait, have more fun.

2486
02:28:23,580 --> 02:28:25,180
I'm having fun!

2487
02:28:26,060 --> 02:28:29,120
What I say is I have a ball around my ankle.

2488
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:31,380
I'm having fun.

2489
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:37,140
You can't see the gun being pointed at me from behind the screen.

2490
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:40,620
I'm having fun.

2491
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,980
I'm having fun.

2492
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:47,940
Oh, this is so fun.

2493
02:28:50,980 --> 02:28:52,120
I'm having fun.

2494
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:57,480
I love being ridiculed online every day.

2495
02:28:58,020 --> 02:29:00,160
Please, I'm having so much fun.

2496
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:03,040
Please call me sick more.

2497
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:04,920
Please call me a freak even more.

2498
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:06,380
I'm having so much fun.

2499
02:29:13,430 --> 02:29:14,830
Hurt me more.

2500
02:29:14,830 --> 02:29:16,950
She despises and she loathes us.

2501
02:29:17,390 --> 02:29:18,610
She curses our houses.

2502
02:29:24,530 --> 02:29:26,070
That's the curse.

2503
02:29:39,670 --> 02:29:41,950
Marrying Mike Tyson's ass!

2504
02:29:42,510 --> 02:29:44,070
Thank you for the gift.

2505
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:45,450
Thank you!

2506
02:29:47,610 --> 02:29:48,670
Thank you, thank you.

2507
02:29:49,070 --> 02:29:55,570
I missed the part where that's my problem in reverse.

2508
02:29:55,710 --> 02:29:56,490
No, it wasn't.

2509
02:29:56,530 --> 02:29:57,590
It was the first time.

2510
02:29:58,070 --> 02:29:59,650
Has anyone flipped it back yet?

2511
02:29:59,950 --> 02:30:01,070
I'm gonna go check Twitter.

2512
02:30:02,430 --> 02:30:04,270
I'm so curious if it sounds good.

2513
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:06,470
I really wanna hear it.

2514
02:30:08,030 --> 02:30:09,770
Has anyone flipped it back yet?

2515
02:30:13,850 --> 02:30:14,450
Wait!

2516
02:30:15,210 --> 02:30:16,250
Is this it?

2517
02:30:17,790 --> 02:30:18,870
Is this it?

2518
02:30:19,150 --> 02:30:20,110
Wait, I wanna hear it.

2519
02:30:23,290 --> 02:30:27,050
Okay, it's gonna be stream-ception for a second.

2520
02:30:30,750 --> 02:30:33,970
No, you have to flip it!

2521
02:30:33,970 --> 02:30:37,290
This is my...

2522
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:47,280
I'm having so much fun.

2523
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:52,660
Hurt me more.

2524
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:57,580
That's my problem in reverse.

2525
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:03,300
I'm so curious if this is the first time.

2526
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:05,760
Has anyone flipped

2527
02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:29,110
it back yet?

2528
02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:29,630
I'm so curious if this is the first time.

2529
02:31:30,630 --> 02:31:43,810
I missed the part where that's my problem in reverse.

2530
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:09,780
I can't believe it.

2531
02:32:34,410 --> 02:32:36,850
I can't believe it worked!

2532
02:32:45,100 --> 02:32:46,580
I'm such a genius!

2533
02:32:49,380 --> 02:32:51,340
I'm such a genius!

2534
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:51,740
Yes!

2535
02:32:52,540 --> 02:32:53,500
Oh gosh.

2536
02:32:54,180 --> 02:32:55,240
Okay.

2537
02:32:55,820 --> 02:32:58,840
Oh sorry, I keep dabbing my eyes.

2538
02:32:59,480 --> 02:33:00,380
Oh gosh.

2539
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:04,540
Oh gosh.

2540
02:33:12,230 --> 02:33:15,910
It sounds so good.

2541
02:33:20,160 --> 02:33:21,320
Okay.

2542
02:33:23,100 --> 02:33:24,340
Oh gosh, okay.

2543
02:33:24,340 --> 02:33:27,340
Oh yeah, I do have my meeting soon-ish.

2544
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:28,720
In about 20 minutes.

2545
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:33,120
Okay, my fifth goal for this year.

2546
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:39,620
I want to finish 50 games.

2547
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:43,300
I want to finish so many games.

2548
02:33:43,620 --> 02:33:45,600
50 games, that might be kind of crazy.

2549
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:48,320
I don't know how many games I finish normally.

2550
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:53,300
But I want to finish 50 games.

2551
02:33:55,960 --> 02:33:57,080
Oh gosh.

2552
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:03,740
It's like a game a week?

2553
02:34:03,820 --> 02:34:04,880
That's totally doable.

2554
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:08,620
We're about to finish two games.

2555
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:14,420
We're going to finish Indiana Jones soon and we're going to finish Devil May Cry.

2556
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:21,080
And I count also games that are one shot games too.

2557
02:34:23,540 --> 02:34:25,540
So we'll have a bunch of games.

2558
02:34:27,380 --> 02:34:29,880
That we can play.

2559
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:36,180
50 games baby.

2560
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:38,240
50 games baby.

2561
02:34:40,700 --> 02:34:41,840
We got this.

2562
02:34:44,540 --> 02:34:45,560
This next one.

2563
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:47,880
I wrote these down.

2564
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:49,200
This is all I wrote down though.

2565
02:34:49,620 --> 02:34:52,620
So I want to come up with at least 10 goals.

2566
02:34:52,620 --> 02:34:54,560
So I wrote down this one.

2567
02:34:54,880 --> 02:34:58,880
I want to have a 3D debut.

2568
02:35:03,300 --> 02:35:05,740
I think the podcast will make a comeback this year.

2569
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:09,940
I'm not sure, to be honest.

2570
02:35:12,600 --> 02:35:16,620
Later on I got to S rank in Tetriol listening to Karaoke Relay.

2571
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:20,280
I checked that off my list of my M and M summer list.

2572
02:35:21,180 --> 02:35:21,740
Congrats!

2573
02:35:23,180 --> 02:35:24,180
Oh my god.

2574
02:35:25,260 --> 02:35:26,260
That's cool.

2575
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:27,920
3D Minto.

2576
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:32,100
I know I have 3D now, but I want to have a proper 3D debut.

2577
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:41,120
And I want to have it with the new model that I've been getting.

2578
02:35:42,860 --> 02:35:44,500
I look forward to that.

2579
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:46,720
It might be a little bit longer.

2580
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:49,200
Can you beat Minesweeper?

2581
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:58,320
Yeah, probably.

2582
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:07,460
Probably.

2583
02:36:11,060 --> 02:36:13,160
Okay guys.

2584
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:16,100
Number 7, beat Minesweeper.

2585
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:17,720
Number 7.

2586
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:22,540
Beat Minesweeper.

2587
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:28,200
That's number 7 of my goals for 2025.

2588
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:31,680
Feel better soon, me and Tom, Minto Appi arrive.

2589
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:33,240
Thanks for ordering it.

2590
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:35,000
Splinter Cell series playthrough.

2591
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:36,340
Maybe.

2592
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:37,480
We'll see.

2593
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:39,840
Maybe.

2594
02:36:42,600 --> 02:36:45,600
I have so many other games I got to get through too.

2595
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:49,020
What should number 8 be?

2596
02:36:50,960 --> 02:36:52,440
New outfit maybe?

2597
02:36:57,270 --> 02:36:58,810
That's a given though, right?

2598
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:08,160
More collabs with friends?

2599
02:37:09,800 --> 02:37:11,160
Yeah, I think that's a good one.

2600
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:14,440
More collabs with friends.

2601
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:16,280
I think that's a good one.

2602
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:20,940
I don't reach out very much to people.

2603
02:37:23,060 --> 02:37:25,760
I don't reach out very much to people, I think.

2604
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:29,600
Desert bus in one sitting.

2605
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:32,240
How else would you do it if not one sitting?

2606
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:38,840
I'm going to combine this one.

2607
02:37:39,700 --> 02:37:41,480
To collab with friends.

2608
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:44,960
Slash, make more friends.

2609
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:47,300
Yeah, I'm going to put it like...

2610
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:50,560
Slash, make more friends.

2611
02:37:55,260 --> 02:37:58,440
I think if I make more friends I can collab with them.

2612
02:37:58,440 --> 02:37:59,540
Probably.

2613
02:38:00,840 --> 02:38:03,660
Get sponsored by something related to Metal Gear.

2614
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:07,100
I could try.

2615
02:38:08,820 --> 02:38:10,440
I could try putting that.

2616
02:38:10,600 --> 02:38:11,960
I'm scared to put that though.

2617
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:15,480
I'm scared to put that though.

2618
02:38:20,980 --> 02:38:22,260
Maybe like...

2619
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:24,560
Get a cool sponsorship.

2620
02:38:25,740 --> 02:38:26,660
Like that.

2621
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:30,200
Maybe.

2622
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:33,740
That's something like I really, really love.

2623
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:37,700
Have you played Squirrel with a Gun?

2624
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:41,840
It's a short semi-Kusoge with a lot of Metal Gear references.

2625
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:42,800
I have not.

2626
02:38:45,660 --> 02:38:47,460
Didn't you literally fulfill that yesterday?

2627
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:51,520
True.

2628
02:38:54,200 --> 02:38:55,720
It is 2585.

2629
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,080
Go fulfilled.

2630
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:05,140
Yeah, get more.

2631
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:09,160
Cool sponsorships.

2632
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:14,060
There we go.

2633
02:39:16,180 --> 02:39:17,080
There we go.

2634
02:39:22,710 --> 02:39:25,770
More cool sponsorships.

2635
02:39:25,770 --> 02:39:26,930
Ships.

2636
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:29,630
Okay.

2637
02:39:31,930 --> 02:39:33,250
Get a Nendoroid figure?

2638
02:39:33,430 --> 02:39:35,650
Oh yeah, that would be good too.

2639
02:39:41,150 --> 02:39:41,870
Maybe...

2640
02:39:45,510 --> 02:39:47,430
How do I want to put it?

2641
02:39:57,780 --> 02:39:58,500
Lambda!

2642
02:39:58,500 --> 02:39:58,720
Lambda!

2643
02:40:07,420 --> 02:40:09,380
I'm doing my best.

2644
02:40:12,660 --> 02:40:15,500
I would, you know...

2645
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:18,120
I'm already dead, but I would die again.

2646
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:23,720
Inscription.

2647
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:29,260
I've seen people play it, but I get really intimidated by playing card games on stream, I'll be honest.

2648
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:32,540
Sound like that without voice lessons?

2649
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:33,320
Screw Nendos.

2650
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:34,000
Get a Figma?

2651
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:37,740
I didn't say Nendoroid, I don't know.

2652
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:44,560
Maybe get more Minto merch?

2653
02:40:45,060 --> 02:40:45,700
Maybe.

2654
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:51,240
Get cool Minto merch.

2655
02:40:51,960 --> 02:40:52,680
Maybe like that.

2656
02:40:54,540 --> 02:40:59,440
I know some people are like, Nendoroid, listen to that.

2657
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:01,960
But...

2658
02:41:04,400 --> 02:41:05,600
I think...

2659
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:08,820
I think maybe I need to grow a little bit more.

2660
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,140
To get those kinds of opportunities.

2661
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:20,060
I'd buy lame Minto merch too.

2662
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:24,660
Any merch I put out has to be cool, right?

2663
02:41:32,540 --> 02:41:33,060
So...

2664
02:41:40,820 --> 02:41:43,920
Maybe this is a good amount.

2665
02:41:44,540 --> 02:41:44,860
Maybe.

2666
02:41:45,720 --> 02:41:49,220
10 things that I want to try and do this year.

2667
02:41:50,380 --> 02:41:53,880
Maybe then at the end of the year we can...

2668
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:56,460
We can see if we hit any of these.

2669
02:41:58,200 --> 02:41:59,080
We'll see.

2670
02:41:59,360 --> 02:42:02,580
I'm really curious to see how many games I'll be finished.

2671
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:03,520
New outfit?

2672
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:04,560
I think that's a given.

2673
02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:07,820
It's not really a goal of mine.

2674
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:11,900
Because it's already a given.

2675
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:21,320
But I think these are things that it's like...

2676
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:22,900
If I...

2677
02:42:23,900 --> 02:42:26,440
Can accomplish it, then it'll be pretty cool.

2678
02:42:29,380 --> 02:42:32,020
Official Minto literal cardboard box merch.

2679
02:42:33,500 --> 02:42:36,820
Pack all your stuff into your official... Are you moving?

2680
02:42:37,300 --> 02:42:41,060
Pack all your things into the official cardboard box.

2681
02:42:42,180 --> 02:42:44,040
Perfect for hiding it too.

2682
02:42:48,310 --> 02:42:51,030
What's the current completed game count?

2683
02:42:51,670 --> 02:42:52,670
I have no idea.

2684
02:42:54,350 --> 02:42:58,450
I have no idea because I have not kept track.

2685
02:42:58,630 --> 02:43:00,830
So starting now.

2686
02:43:01,650 --> 02:43:04,850
Starting now I'll be keeping track every time I beat a game.

2687
02:43:11,780 --> 02:43:13,200
Now we gotta keep track.

2688
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:14,440
Starting now.

2689
02:43:14,900 --> 02:43:15,560
Starting now.

2690
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:16,140
Now.

2691
02:43:16,420 --> 02:43:16,680
Now.

2692
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:17,100
Now.

2693
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:17,480
Now.

2694
02:43:17,620 --> 02:43:17,800
Now.

2695
02:43:17,980 --> 02:43:18,180
Now.

2696
02:43:18,360 --> 02:43:18,460
Now.

2697
02:43:18,460 --> 02:43:19,220
This literal second.

2698
02:43:19,620 --> 02:43:20,660
This literal second.

2699
02:43:23,940 --> 02:43:25,240
We'll also keep track for you.

2700
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:26,760
If you can help, that'd be great.

2701
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:28,820
But I'm also gonna make like a spreadsheet too.

2702
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:30,780
I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.

2703
02:43:35,270 --> 02:43:36,670
Will there be a breath hole?

2704
02:43:37,430 --> 02:43:37,830
No.

2705
02:43:39,210 --> 02:43:42,750
What if Minto merch packed in a custom-designed cardboard box?

2706
02:43:42,750 --> 02:43:50,330
What about something crazy like official streaming host of a cool non-vtuber, non-anime event?

2707
02:43:52,230 --> 02:43:52,950
Wait...

2708
02:43:52,950 --> 02:43:55,010
What do you mean, wait?

2709
02:43:56,590 --> 02:43:58,450
Beat the Metal Gear Pachinko machine?

2710
02:43:58,610 --> 02:43:59,270
Oh god!

2711
02:44:01,830 --> 02:44:03,550
Oh, MGS Con!

2712
02:44:10,870 --> 02:44:12,690
MGS Con, MGS Con.

2713
02:44:14,970 --> 02:44:16,430
True, I forgot.

2714
02:44:17,330 --> 02:44:18,050
Oh gosh.

2715
02:44:18,470 --> 02:44:19,750
Well, I didn't...

2716
02:44:19,750 --> 02:44:21,290
There's been a lot going on, okay?

2717
02:44:21,370 --> 02:44:23,390
And I also have sick jet lag brain.

2718
02:44:23,850 --> 02:44:24,870
Give me a break!

2719
02:44:30,410 --> 02:44:32,130
Number 11, stay healthy.

2720
02:44:32,530 --> 02:44:36,190
Yeah, I think this is a good 10.

2721
02:44:38,110 --> 02:44:39,930
I've completed 43 games.

2722
02:44:40,730 --> 02:44:43,090
Oh no, she's referring back to her know-how.

2723
02:44:43,670 --> 02:44:45,230
43 games, like last year?

2724
02:44:47,610 --> 02:44:49,150
I did 43 last year.

2725
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:53,810
Well then, 50 is completely doable.

2726
02:44:58,420 --> 02:44:59,660
50 is like...

2727
02:44:59,660 --> 02:45:01,780
Yeah, and I came back in April, exactly.

2728
02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:04,420
So...

2729
02:45:04,420 --> 02:45:05,980
50 is totally doable.

2730
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:09,940
Hmm...

2731
02:45:10,620 --> 02:45:14,540
I just want to share, I proposed to my girlfriend on New Year's and she said yes!

2732
02:45:15,580 --> 02:45:18,120
I showed her your streams and she became an instant wisp.

2733
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:19,280
We both missed you.

2734
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:21,320
Nevermore!

2735
02:45:23,580 --> 02:45:26,280
I mean, our girlfriend.

2736
02:45:28,740 --> 02:45:29,940
Our fiancé.

2737
02:45:30,860 --> 02:45:33,340
Congratulations to our...

2738
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:33,980
Engagement!

2739
02:45:38,030 --> 02:45:40,690
Congratulations to our engagement!

2740
02:45:46,150 --> 02:45:48,190
But seriously, I'm happy for you!

2741
02:45:48,290 --> 02:45:49,230
Congratulations!

2742
02:45:51,590 --> 02:45:52,170
Wow.

2743
02:45:53,450 --> 02:45:53,790
Nice.

2744
02:45:56,930 --> 02:45:58,910
Imagine getting a marriage proposal.

2745
02:46:03,050 --> 02:46:04,170
Wow.

2746
02:46:04,170 --> 02:46:04,410
Wow.

2747
02:46:06,850 --> 02:46:08,050
I'm happy for you.

2748
02:46:13,710 --> 02:46:16,550
Things Minto will never get.

2749
02:46:22,950 --> 02:46:24,770
She's so parasocial.

2750
02:46:24,930 --> 02:46:25,170
Stop!

2751
02:46:25,170 --> 02:46:25,430
Stop!

2752
02:46:32,710 --> 02:46:35,470
Is there a penalty for not completing this list?

2753
02:46:37,870 --> 02:46:40,150
Okay, but some of this stuff I can't help.

2754
02:46:41,010 --> 02:46:44,650
I can't help if people don't want to hire me for sponsorships.

2755
02:46:45,710 --> 02:46:51,270
And I can't help it if I don't make it to the amount of subscribers.

2756
02:46:56,030 --> 02:46:57,510
That's not up to me.

2757
02:47:02,390 --> 02:47:04,050
Just be more marketable.

2758
02:47:11,810 --> 02:47:14,690
I mean, there's something that gets to me, you know.

2759
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:17,290
I know I'm not very marketable, I guess.

2760
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:06,140
That's okay, I'll do my best.

2761
02:48:09,220 --> 02:48:12,600
I think they clearly meant a penalty for Wisps, not Minto.

2762
02:48:13,380 --> 02:48:15,400
Why would there be a penalty for you guys?

2763
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:17,040
What if I just didn't do it then?

2764
02:48:17,560 --> 02:48:19,800
I could do it so I could watch you get punished.

2765
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:24,940
Watch you get punished.

2766
02:48:25,380 --> 02:48:26,240
Punished Wisps.

2767
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:31,080
I would like to wear some Minto shirts, please.

2768
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:33,100
Shirts, you say?

2769
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:36,240
I will consider it.

2770
02:48:37,420 --> 02:48:39,940
My plushie on pre-order says that you're very marketable.

2771
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:13,200
Don't judge what I don't judge.

2772
02:49:21,250 --> 02:49:23,020
A very special marketable.

2773
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:30,180
Hmm...

2774
02:49:30,180 --> 02:49:31,760
But,

2775
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:43,080
you know.

2776
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:49,720
More so than the...

2777
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:53,360
Than the... What's it called?

2778
02:49:55,940 --> 02:49:57,620
Than the...

2779
02:49:57,620 --> 02:49:59,280
Whatever's the...

2780
02:50:00,460 --> 02:50:01,300
Opportunities.

2781
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:03,980
I still have a lot of fun, so...

2782
02:50:05,720 --> 02:50:08,960
If anything, I think that's worth much more.

2783
02:50:09,440 --> 02:50:10,300
I think I would...

2784
02:50:10,300 --> 02:50:13,060
Imagine, you know, you could get every opportunity in the world.

2785
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:16,980
But if, you know, it's in a crappy situation...

2786
02:50:19,500 --> 02:50:19,940
Then...

2787
02:50:19,940 --> 02:50:23,120
Or if you're not having fun, you're not enjoying it, then...

2788
02:50:23,120 --> 02:50:25,360
I think that would be...

2789
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:30,020
Be worse than, you know, if you never got any opportunities at all.

2790
02:50:31,700 --> 02:50:32,140
So...

2791
02:50:34,300 --> 02:50:35,840
Thank you Carlamel!

2792
02:50:35,980 --> 02:50:36,640
Thank you for the icon!

2793
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:40,160
I hear couples channels are pretty marketable.

2794
02:50:53,690 --> 02:50:54,990
Is that true?

2795
02:50:56,470 --> 02:50:59,030
Do people watch couples channels?

2796
02:51:00,430 --> 02:51:02,290
What, do you want to become a family channel?

2797
02:51:07,260 --> 02:51:07,900
Yeah?

2798
02:51:08,300 --> 02:51:08,920
Wait, really?

2799
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:09,040
Really?

2800
02:51:19,270 --> 02:51:20,310
I volunteer.

2801
02:51:22,250 --> 02:51:23,430
Does Fuwamuko count?

2802
02:51:24,350 --> 02:51:24,990
I don't...

2803
02:51:24,990 --> 02:51:27,250
Well, they are definitely...

2804
02:51:27,250 --> 02:51:28,790
They are a pair.

2805
02:51:28,930 --> 02:51:30,210
I would not say a couple, maybe.

2806
02:51:32,070 --> 02:51:34,690
I don't know if I would call it a...

2807
02:51:34,690 --> 02:51:36,950
They are truly a family channel.

2808
02:51:37,470 --> 02:51:39,070
In that they are family.

2809
02:51:46,170 --> 02:51:47,550
Don't tell that to Fuwawa.

2810
02:51:52,610 --> 02:51:55,970
I know their... I know their...

2811
02:51:55,970 --> 02:51:57,250
Their tastes.

2812
02:51:58,510 --> 02:51:59,970
I know their tastes.

2813
02:52:06,870 --> 02:52:09,610
Their sweet home Alabama tastes.

2814
02:52:13,090 --> 02:52:14,870
Thank you for the pink!

2815
02:52:15,430 --> 02:52:16,310
So punny.

2816
02:52:16,730 --> 02:52:20,870
My mom called me to tell you that she loves your streams and to let you know that you are very marketable.

2817
02:52:21,550 --> 02:52:22,430
No way!

2818
02:52:22,710 --> 02:52:25,290
She subscribed as craftmom1.

2819
02:52:25,510 --> 02:52:25,950
What?

2820
02:52:26,090 --> 02:52:27,150
That's so cute!

2821
02:52:28,450 --> 02:52:30,870
No way did she call you to be like...

2822
02:52:33,690 --> 02:52:35,670
No way she calls you to say that.

2823
02:52:40,760 --> 02:52:41,860
You want a cute girl?

2824
02:52:41,980 --> 02:52:43,040
Meant to pick me instead.

2825
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:50,200
Would you love me even with my snotty nose?

2826
02:52:52,040 --> 02:52:56,140
Would you love me even if my nose was dripping down my face the entire stream?

2827
02:52:58,540 --> 02:52:59,280
Stuffed Sharky!

2828
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:00,940
Thank you for the 20 gupter!

2829
02:53:01,160 --> 02:53:01,920
Thank you!

2830
02:53:12,100 --> 02:53:13,440
Snot makes me extra cute.

2831
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:15,000
What if I make it extra big?

2832
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:16,600
Oh shoot, my meeting.

2833
02:53:21,080 --> 02:53:22,320
Is soon.

2834
02:53:24,220 --> 02:53:25,400
Happy New Year!

2835
02:53:27,720 --> 02:53:29,420
Allow me to make it big.

2836
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:37,640
Now it's even bigger.

2837
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:45,940
Guys, I think I'm sick.

2838
02:53:46,660 --> 02:53:48,000
Guys, I think I'm...

2839
02:53:52,580 --> 02:53:53,980
Guys, I think I'm...

2840
02:53:53,980 --> 02:53:55,760
I think I'm sick in the head.

2841
02:53:56,180 --> 02:53:57,560
I'm leaking ectoplasm.

2842
02:53:58,020 --> 02:53:59,200
Big ectoplasm drip.

2843
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:08,320
Minto beanie, hoodie, gloves, cards, stickers, decals, air fresheners, bags, even a pen.

2844
02:54:09,100 --> 02:54:11,140
You want a bunch of practical stuff.

2845
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:13,400
I appreciate it.

2846
02:54:14,660 --> 02:54:16,360
Couples content is so last year.

2847
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:18,060
Come fist fight me behind a Wal-Mart.

2848
02:54:18,140 --> 02:54:19,680
Wal-Mart or Denny's?

2849
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:21,680
What about the Waffle House?

2850
02:54:21,800 --> 02:54:24,140
Isn't that where everybody fights, is the Waffle House?

2851
02:54:28,740 --> 02:54:34,240
But yeah, let's do our best, you guys, with achieving all of these goals for 2025.

2852
02:54:34,960 --> 02:54:36,760
I had a lot of fun in 2024.

2853
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:41,720
I know I came back and everything.

2854
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:46,460
So, I'll do my best for 2025.

2855
02:54:53,720 --> 02:54:55,940
I can't think anymore.

2856
02:54:57,440 --> 02:54:58,920
I can't think anymore.

2857
02:55:00,260 --> 02:55:02,940
I think I've leaked my brain out.

2858
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:06,360
How about releasing voice packs?

2859
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:09,060
You might just have to wait.

2860
02:55:10,300 --> 02:55:11,260
And see.

2861
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:17,060
Actually, part of my meeting is about merchandise, so...

2862
02:55:20,220 --> 02:55:21,780
I don't think these went through.

2863
02:55:23,260 --> 02:55:26,340
Superliminal, thank you for the stream lives.

2864
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:29,520
Best of luck achieving your 2025 goals and more.

2865
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:30,520
Thank you!

2866
02:55:31,120 --> 02:55:32,800
Alrighty, thank you!

2867
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:36,680
We'll keep pushing you until you can achieve everything you want to, Minto.

2868
02:55:37,020 --> 02:55:37,800
Thank you!

2869
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:40,840
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2870
02:55:41,180 --> 02:55:46,180
Glad I heard my cat.

2871
02:55:47,620 --> 02:55:50,380
Okay, I'm going to go rest now.

2872
02:55:50,980 --> 02:55:52,360
So I will see you guys...

2873
02:55:53,740 --> 02:55:56,980
Well, I have my meeting and then I'm going to drink the rest of this.

2874
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:05,480
Sleep medicine.

2875
02:56:06,220 --> 02:56:06,800
Yeah!

2876
02:56:08,060 --> 02:56:09,100
Meeting with your bed.

2877
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:13,840
After.

2878
02:56:15,160 --> 02:56:15,740
Otsumito!

2879
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:20,700
It's been a while since I did just a chat stream.

2880
02:56:21,620 --> 02:56:23,160
So I hope you guys had fun.

2881
02:56:23,220 --> 02:56:25,020
I hope you guys liked it.

2882
02:56:26,250 --> 02:56:30,940
I didn't say so much about Japan, because honestly so much didn't happen.

2883
02:56:30,940 --> 02:56:36,680
But I'm glad we could talk still about lots of fun stuff.

2884
02:56:37,460 --> 02:56:39,840
Also I missed the part where that's my problem.

2885
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:40,680
Otsumito!

2886
02:56:41,540 --> 02:56:42,400
Bye bye!

2887
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:43,580
Bye bye!

2888
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:44,340
Good night!

2889
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:45,620
Bye bye!
