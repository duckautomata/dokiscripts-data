1
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:37,180
Gamers, are you ready to discover the mysteries of the Druids?

2
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,860
I

3
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,180
shared a tattoo of you.

4
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
Wait, what?!

5
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,660
You don't find it, Dusko retweeted it.

6
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,040
What?

7
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,000
What?

8
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm not a wizard, I'm a druid!

9
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,540
Please, don't insult me.

10
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,040
I ate the human meat.

11
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,200
And then I ate it twice.

12
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,940
Just like Hal again.

13
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,140
Why is the music so cute here?

14
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,460
Oh!

15
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,220
Oh!

16
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,100
Was it tasty?

17
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,000
If it weren't, would I have gone back for seconds?

18
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,540
Druids have hoods though.

19
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,960
Not Neo-Druids.

20
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,700
So, yesterday we decided that we would all wear wizard hats.

21
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,920
I mean druid hats.

22
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,740
What are you guys talking about?

23
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,100
Oh, heyo!

24
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,240
Koyu!

25
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,580
Shuki, Shuki, Shuki.

26
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,380
Shuki, shuki, shuko, shuko.

27
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,020
Hold on.

28
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,420
My chair is too far away.

29
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
I put on my robe and druid hat.

30
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,360
Yeah.

31
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,220
Are neo-druids just wizards?

32
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,040
How would be?

33
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,320
No.

34
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,500
You're looking very unskeletonized today, Mito-wo, thank you.

35
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,540
That would be pretty crazy if I were skeletonized because I don't think I have bones.

36
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,920
Well, maybe like ectoplasmy.

37
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,920
Bones.

38
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,940
Can't wait to see Hal again perform more morally questionable and outright illegal acts.

39
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,400
Well, guys, we're going to the past.

40
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:35,900
Wait.

41
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,560
How's that song go?

42
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,040
One step at a time.

43
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,940
To the past.

44
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,020
Nah, well, thank you so much for the...

45
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,540
For the 10 gifts of...

46
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:50,960
Thank you.

47
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,580
We're back here.

48
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:20,520

49
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
17 years of Minto.

50
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,260
We're going to go unalive, not, not, well, I was going to say unalive a baby.

51
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,040
Unbirth a, well, baby, the babies, okay, wait.

52
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,560
The babies are birthed, but do we kill the babies?

53
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,060
Is that going to be our crime today?

54
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,060
Hmm.

55
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,100
I was on back order for your plushie.

56
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,960
I got it today.

57
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,360
Minto!

58
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,420
Thank you.

59
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,660
Thank you.

60
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,840
Unbirth.

61
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,180
Are we going to...

62
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:49,860
murder babies today because the babies are the descendants so did you have to say unbirth well I don't know what else to call it I'm not quite we're not birthing the babies that's for sure let's see what our girlfriend has to say Brent it's about that conversation we had what is it Brent more questions you're really curious wait do you guys hear an echo or is it mean oh wait can I ask you wait how can we get to the oh can I ask you something personal okay I mean where we might die here so might as well but the whole new meaning on baby food Can I ask you something personal?

63
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,440
That depends on just how personal it is, Brent.

64
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,740
Are you married?

65
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,380
What did you think of me when I first came to your museum?

66
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,420
Do we be direct?

67
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,800
Or do we kind of ask for...

68
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,500
We get a little bit of a...

69
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,120
Let's be direct.

70
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,860
Are you married?

71
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,920
Oh, well, um...

72
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,500
Was that too private a question?

73
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,060
Yes.

74
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,960
No.

75
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,340
Oh, I don't.

76
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,640
know you don't have to answer it's all right brent i was married i got married as soon as i was 18.

77
00:10:25,840 --> 00:11:17,160
you know you know my father dragged one of his younger colleagues round to our house every weekend a real high flyer with money an expensive car and a golf club membership he was called peter peter what do you mean you were don't act so offended and elegant Peter not Peter wait and you married him hmm I mean does he not know what a divorce is what do you mean you were married after our wedding Peter soon changed you know at the beginning he was sort of charming sort of then he became different unpredictable tempered violent he hit you yes it started with a box around the ears.

78
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,600
And then it happened all the time.

79
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,980
You put up with that?

80
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,120
For some time, I did.

81
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,540
I thought, well, that's what it's like to be married.

82
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,380
How long did that go on for?

83
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,260
About two years.

84
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,000
Then I divorced him when I found out that he'd been unfaithful to me with some girls from the golf club all the time.

85
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,620
The golf club.

86
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,940
The golf club.

87
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,020
And did you start studying immediately after getting divorced?

88
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,440
What did your father say to all this?

89
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,900
That must have been a difficult... We could be there for her, and then she would be like, wow, he's so nice.

90
00:11:45,020 --> 00:12:47,140
Thank you for telling me that, okay this is we're shooting our shot we're being considerate and compassionate we're being empathetic we are that must have been a difficult time for you it was hell I was alone broke and I'd had enough of men I can imagine that oh so I have heard from this Peter guy since then after the divorce he behaved like a lunatic for months what he called all the time or he appeared drunk in front of the house and screamed abuse in the middle of the night he even waited for me in the museum and swore at me i had to call the police oh my god god what a psychopath you know what he's doing could it be me yes now and then i read about him in the papers he's a director of the anthropological society now one of the bigwigs he seems to have achieved what he always wanted and as far as i know he's married again but i'm not really that interested in his life all things over for me now i'm just glad to be left in peace are you being empathetic without the Oh,

91
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Melanie, I forgot to tell you my previous name.

92
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,040
Was Peter.

93
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,100
Oh my gosh.

94
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:54,980
Did you start?

95
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,540
And did you start studying all the tea on Melanie?

96
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,260
Yes, I started working and financed my studies myself.

97
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,920
I wanted to be independent at last, from my father, my husband, from everything that had restricted me before.

98
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,760
I studied like mad.

99
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,240
Like mad.

100
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,640
I spent the nights in the library.

101
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,920
And you were successful.

102
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,180
I didn't have anything left apart from my career.

103
00:13:16,700 --> 00:14:17,260
so I thought make the best of it oh my goodness and it worked yep what did your father what did your father say to all this poor girl right my father wasn't delighted with the divorce he saw how I suffered all the time but he didn't want to believe it oh my god after all the whole this is so out of left field can I just say that I wanted to split up his first concern was that it might harm his research contacts Wow what about your mother I lost my mother a long time ago she had cancer and died very early when I was only nine do you get on well with your father after splitting up with Peter we lost touch for a number of years my father just couldn't understand why I wouldn't do what he wanted anymore he couldn't understand how I could deprive him of his allegedly gorgeous gorgeous son-in-law and I was disappointed in him it was only when I got my degree and we became colleagues so to speak that our relationship Wow.

104
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,560
You have a business relationship with your dad.

105
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,000
Thank you for telling me that, Melanie.

106
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,660
I don't usually talk that much about myself, Brent.

107
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,720
But meanwhile, you've become almost like a friend.

108
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,100
Wait!

109
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,980
Oh, we're almost...

110
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,300
Wait, you guys, we're almost friend-zoned.

111
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,470
We're not friend-zoned yet.

112
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,870
We're almost friend-zoned.

113
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,670
I think that's worse.

114
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,530
It's about that conversation we had.

115
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,330
What is it, Brent?

116
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,550
More questions?

117
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,430
You're really curious.

118
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,670
Could I ask you, wait?

119
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,470
Can you see what's over there on the rocky island?

120
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,570
You mean the tower?

121
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,070
No, I mean the thing in front of the tower.

122
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:05,470
What?

123
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,930
No idea.

124
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,130
Looks like scales or scaffolding.

125
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,130
What purpose could that serve?

126
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,090
If we stay here, we'll never know.

127
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,670
Acquaintance zone.

128
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,370
How do we get, I guess we just, I don't know why I'm asking this.

129
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,970
I want the dialogue.

130
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,910
Bridges don't look very inviting to me.

131
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,690
Yeah, there's bridges.

132
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,630
Yes, I can see what you mean.

133
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,910
A lot of them have cracks as well.

134
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,310
Nah, it's fine.

135
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,490
It's probably too much of a risk.

136
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:27,970
Oh, no.

137
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,330
They will collapse one after the other.

138
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:29,570
What?

139
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,050
No, they're strong.

140
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,110
But we can't just stay here and hope for a miracle either.

141
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,730
We have to do something.

142
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,250
We summon the power of the Druids.

143
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,910
Do you think we could really time travel?

144
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,810
Oh, my God, there's so much.

145
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,730
Did Blake say anything else that could help us?

146
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,150
Oh, Blake!

147
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:45,990
I don't think so.

148
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,630
Not while I was there, anyway.

149
00:15:48,430 --> 00:16:45,390
were the one who talked to him he only told me that there had been a place of worship at this location for millennia that doesn't help me now that's crazy that's crazy crazy do you think you can really time travel from here scientifically I'd say it's impossible but like you said it's our only chance if this doesn't get us anywhere we're finished we should try everything what what what do you think why was it built like I don't know I'm an anthropologist not an architect our house we will find a way of getting over there i hope so let's go over there let's go over there anything let's go read the sign whoa shrek why did i wait okay oh my god all right good

150
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,630
Why did I take those?

151
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,590
Wait, where are they?

152
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,950
What?

153
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,030
What?

154
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:55,930
Wait, what?

155
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:57,790
What?

156
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,450
You guys- It won't work like that.

157
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,270
My screen is... Hold on.

158
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,910
Wait, there's actually something wrong with my screen because I can't see my full inventory.

159
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,090
I was wondering why the subtitles were cut off.

160
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,510
Wait a second.

161
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,250
Why is it different though?

162
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, that's so strange.

163
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,320
Wait.

164
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,000
This is so bizarre.

165
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,680
Is it showing up normal for you guys?

166
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,780
No.

167
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,140
I didn't change anything.

168
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,720
That's why I'm so confused.

169
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,880
Hold on.

170
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,600
One moment, please.

171
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,620
I'm so sorry.

172
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,480
Huh.

173
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,740
Why did the resolution change?

174
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,700
What?

175
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,300
Why did it change?

176
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,860
Look, this is normal.

177
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,840
Huh.

178
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,040
Did Lego Indy screw up your resolution?

179
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,220
I don't think so.

180
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,460
Oh, no.

181
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,660
Because I used a different capture for last stream.

182
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,640
This is so weird.

183
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,500
It looks wider than usual.

184
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,580
Yeah, it is wider than usual.

185
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,240
I'm not gonna lie.

186
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm extremely confused right now.

187
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,500
Why it suddenly went to widescreen.

188
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,800
I wonder if it's maybe this part of the game for some reason.

189
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,400
Well, now I need to move myself a little bit, I think.

190
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,880
Let's let's do that.

191
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,240
Huh.

192
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,400
You could say it's a mystery of the druid.

193
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,060
I'm actually so confused right now.

194
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,460
Well, I'm sorry.

195
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:56,740
I started.

196
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:19,380
up the game with with it not being a widescreen but I didn't know so I've been playing and the game has been fine this whole time okay so we got boards of the danger sign the boards of the danger sign okay this is very strange he's

197
00:19:23,530 --> 00:20:04,580
walking so slowly and like at varying intervals of hello is he ever gonna reach it as a professional computer I can tell you the reason this happened is because computers are haunted I'll invoice you later um no no no no no this haunting is is spoken for you stay out this is my territory arched bridges must be ancient wait no no I want to talk to her I good place for me to be.

198
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,900
I'm like blacking everything.

199
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,700
It's about that conversation we had.

200
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,520
What is it, Brent?

201
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,740
More questions?

202
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,620
You're really curious.

203
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,320
Okay, I think, uh, okay, this is all the stuff we asked before.

204
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,600
Um, there's these arched bridges must be ancient.

205
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,440
Must be ancient.

206
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,260
There's a rather strange building over there.

207
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,860
Mm-hmm.

208
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,840
Arched bridges.

209
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,840
That must be ancient, I think.

210
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,880
Wait, so how do we, get over there.

211
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,300
Just walk.

212
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,440
Like, this one looks completely safe.

213
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,520
Oh, yeah, there we go.

214
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,080
Awesome.

215
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
Now I hear the echo.

216
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,120
Yeah, okay, run.

217
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,100
Don't walk.

218
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,400
Run.

219
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,140
Nice.

220
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,120
Oh, yeah, we can totally make it.

221
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,350
Oh, my God.

222
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,850
Don't stand so close to me.

223
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:01,970
Hello?

224
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,070
Is there something that I'm supposed to notice here?

225
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,710
Melanie?

226
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,270
Brent?

227
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:07,590
Brent?

228
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,110
Oh my god, no!

229
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,130
What is it, Brent?

230
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,350
More questions?

231
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,030
You're really curious.

232
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,070
He's too curious!

233
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,210
He's too curious!

234
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,490
Which one?

235
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,570
Let's see, I'm searching for anything.

236
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,830
Do you use the boards for something?

237
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,450
That would make maybe too much sense.

238
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,870
I should think about it again.

239
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,910
Hmm.

240
00:21:40,770 --> 00:22:10,950
so about your divorce how much did you cry do you need an arm do you need a shoulder to cry on okay what am I supposed to do here hmm guys I think I'm gonna sorry I'm so confused about why the game is suddenly big so I'm going to make it smaller I'm so sorry I don't know why it's like this Wait,

241
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:11,470
can I?

242
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,510
Oh, yeah, I can.

243
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,990
What the?

244
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,950
Is that...

245
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,890
This is awkward.

246
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,110
Is it too weird looking?

247
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,950
I'm so annoyed right now.

248
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,230
Yeah, see?

249
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,570
She's cut off.

250
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:28,790
Why?

251
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,770
Why?

252
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:32,670
Why?

253
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,060
So bizarre.

254
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,940
How bizarre?

255
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,960
How bizarre?

256
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,620
I don't understand.

257
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,100
I'm sorry.

258
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,720
I'm actually, like, so confused.

259
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,520
But that's okay.

260
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,480
We're here.

261
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,940
And I'm going to figure out what to do.

262
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,980
We're searching.

263
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,260
We're searching.

264
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,280
It's so quiet.

265
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,880
The music does not loop for some reason.

266
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,560
Melanie, does your divorce have anything to do with these bridges?

267
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,160
widescreen.

268
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,080
Yeah, exactly.

269
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,980
Can you squeeze it to 4-3 and OBS?

270
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,220
That's what, that's what, that's what this is.

271
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,260
This is my 4-3.

272
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,440
But, it like, does, it, for some reason it's cutting off now.

273
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,780
That's so mysterious.

274
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
I can't get over it.

275
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,000
And the weirder thing is, it doesn't look...

276
00:23:44,780 --> 00:24:19,420
like stretched out maybe it doesn't look but it's so weird sorry okay i'm fine we're fine everything's fine i think the game switched the widescreen i think so too maybe for a mysterious effect maybe okay walk walk over it oh what the heck am i supposed to do here read the runes read them go back go back

277
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:36,780
I tried the wood planks nothing happened unless I didn't put it in the right spot but this is like the only place I can go unless there's something over here

278
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:52,080
hmm unless I miss like a side area over here or something oh Oh my god, there's nobody even going back.

279
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,100
Like, this is it.

280
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,820
This is it.

281
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,920
There's nowhere to go from here.

282
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:01,990
Hmm.

283
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,570
The true mystery of the druids was widescreen.

284
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,970
Maybe, like, they're the first to ever do widescreen.

285
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,450
And they're, like, showing it off.

286
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,570
They're like, well, this is it.

287
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,330
We're the first.

288
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,190
Okay, so it's definitely something right here.

289
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,050
With the planks.

290
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,390
Unless we're pixel hunting.

291
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,250
so ahead of there that

292
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:52,020
looks even more dangerous why are you just standing there this looks way more dangerous than anything else

293
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:36,580
no way this is way less sturdy than just using the bridge good heavens that was close oh my god are you okay yes I'm all right you've got a nerve Brent Halligan how dare you upset me like that what I do you could have got killed it's all right Melanie I'm still alive don't you ever do that again do you hear me hey all right He didn't cause the bridge to...

294
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,300
Wait, how is she gonna get over here now?

295
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,360
Wait a second.

296
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,120
Wait.

297
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,120
Wait.

298
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,280
Halligan, we're just leaving her.

299
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,060
Wait, how is that Melanie supposed to cross?

300
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,610
Okay, I'm going one plank at a time.

301
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:56,330
Very slowly.

302
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,490
Caution, danger indeed.

303
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,390
This is so dumb.

304
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:01,550
Oh.

305
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,030
Okay, Melanie, good luck.

306
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,570
Melanie?

307
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:08,230
Melanie?

308
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,090
I made it.

309
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,550
I'm on the other side.

310
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,330
Great, Brent.

311
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,990
What's it like over there?

312
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,170
Interesting.

313
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,490
There's a rather strange tower with some sort of scales in front of it.

314
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,330
No idea what it's used for.

315
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,750
Come here and see for yourself.

316
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,410
I can't, Brent.

317
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,970
You've got both boards on your side.

318
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,030
Yeah, idiot.

319
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,150
Oh, damn.

320
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,530
That's true.

321
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,890
Brent, how much do you weigh?

322
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:36,950
What?

323
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,270
How much do you weigh?

324
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,490
Your weight.

325
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,530
About 160 pounds.

326
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,830
Why do you want to know?

327
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,650
A hundred and...

328
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:46,850
A hundred and...

329
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,850
A hundred and sixty pounds?

330
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,370
I'm coming over now?

331
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,790
Melanie, don't...

332
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,110
Stop at once.

333
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,130
The bridge will collapse.

334
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,230
Oh my god, no, Melanie, don't do it!

335
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,470
Melanie, no!

336
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,230
No, Melanie!

337
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:02,650
No, Melanie!

338
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,250
Oh my god, wait.

339
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,990
Oh my god, wait.

340
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,530
Oh my god, no sense of urgency.

341
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,710
She just walked like she was in a fashion show.

342
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:15,930
Melanie.

343
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,700
Okay, that was fine.

344
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:26,800
Good job.

345
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,340
Melanie, how dare you do that?

346
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,980
Here we are.

347
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,480
What shall we do now?

348
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,160
She slayed.

349
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,840
I'd say we have to get into the tower.

350
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,180
Oh gosh, more personal questions.

351
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,040
Could I ask you something personal?

352
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,560
That depends on just how personal it is, Brenna.

353
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,060
What did you think of me?

354
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,580
What did you think of me when I first came to your museum?

355
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,920
It's average for a shorter guy.

356
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,280
Oh, yeah?

357
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,760
Do I really have to tell you?

358
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,560
Of course you don't have to.

359
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,240
But I'd like to know.

360
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,360
I'll tell you, but only if you promise not to be angry with me.

361
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,740
Uh-oh.

362
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,440
Oh, God.

363
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,400
Is it that bad?

364
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,380
Well, do you promise?

365
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,000
Uh-oh.

366
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,660
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,960
Lay it on me.

368
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,680
Be honest.

369
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,200
Okay.

370
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,140
I promise.

371
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,000
I thought this unshaven bloke's wearing a totally unfashionable coat.

372
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,640
What?

373
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:28,780
what that's what you thought yes and was that all you thought you asked a lot of questions brent i think that's enough for a start perhaps we can chat a bit more later now we've got other problems as well don't you think sure more than enough i would say

374
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:45,020
oh this guy i it was uh that all you thought what is this oh Slicking his hair back.

375
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,220
That looks like scales.

376
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,940
But what are they used for?

377
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,200
What do you mean scales?

378
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,720
Is this not like brick?

379
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,080
Why do they keep calling it scales?

380
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,400
Or do they mean like the vines growing up?

381
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,340
The door is completely flat.

382
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,980
No handle, no lock.

383
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,720
Nothing.

384
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,060
Just like me, for real, for real.

385
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,680
Really strange this building.

386
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,500
How?

387
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,640
Did you think there was something of a handsome...

388
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,160
man under the cup.

389
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,340
That looks like scales, but what are they used for?

390
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,800
Oh, like a waking scale.

391
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,620
I'm thinking like a dragon.

392
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,510
I was like, what do you mean?

393
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,110
Scale.

394
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,010
English is hard, you guys, please.

395
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,820
I'm crying.

396
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:52,940
No.

397
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,070
Oh, gosh.

398
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,990
Oh, man.

399
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:24,130
Wait, can we climb in here get in there or wait maybe I can put in the amulet wait does this actually work oh oh my

400
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:42,590
gosh I'm maybe I'm thinking like a druid for real it's that how heavy is it I know right okay let's go in that's too dangerous wait Why?

401
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,130
That's too dangerous.

402
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,490
I got it open.

403
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,030
There's a wheel up there.

404
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,430
I opened it.

405
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,890
Why is it too dangerous?

406
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,710
Maybe...

407
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,450
Oh!

408
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,390
That's too dangerous.

409
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:02,870
Still?

410
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,530
Um...

411
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,030
Never change, Vito Brun.

412
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:09,150
Yeah.

413
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,600
Is there something else I can add to it?

414
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,280
Nothing's happening.

415
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,720
It might need the amulet.

416
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,660
You think so?

417
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,520
Maybe we put something else in there instead.

418
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,560
Grab this.

419
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,080
Oh, wait!

420
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
If we take it and then it closes...

421
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,020
Aha!

422
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,820
Okay.

423
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,200
Now we can enter!

424
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,100
The case file.

425
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,980
Always the case file.

426
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,870
Oh, we've faded into the...

427
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,460
Elaborate floor ornaments.

428
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:04,940
Goodbye.

429
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,360
Weren't there similar symbols in Sinclair's house?

430
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,520
Yes, it was...

431
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,700
Campfire to the right.

432
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,220
That's all I remember.

433
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:44,410
another tub empty again oh wait put it in that's futile as well why it worked before no better not not a good idea oh okay oh god um elaborate floor ornaments

435
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,750
Anything else?

436
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,210
Little window.

437
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,070
The arrow slits are exactly in the direction of the bridges.

438
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,990
It was possible to defend this building perfectly.

439
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:37,690
Oh.

440
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,750
Wait, can I put them like in here?

441
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,270
No, not in the slots, no.

442
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,550
I thought it wouldn't work like that.

443
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,090
Oh, okay.

444
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,250
Then why'd you try?

445
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,830
Why'd you try?

446
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,470
I thought it wouldn't work like that.

447
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:52,830
Oh.

448
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,010
Melanie speak!

449
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,350
What's wrong with you?

450
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,130
She's possessed!

451
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,390
Oh my god!

452
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,290
Possessed Melanie!

453
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:02,930
Oh, ouch.

454
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,150
Oh, sorry if you heard that.

455
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,160
Wouldn't... No, it wouldn't be this one.

456
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,060
I can't tell which... I can't see the other ones in the back.

457
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,880
And then...

458
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
We also can't see this one down here.

459
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,440
How are we supposed to know what it looks like?

460
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,750
Hmm.

461
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,270
in Sinclair's house.

462
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,530
I mean, similar symbols in Sinclair's.

463
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:42,730
Why are there similar symbols in Sinclair's house?

464
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,800
Has Halligan been holding on to a painting frame this entire time?

465
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,580
Yes, he has.

466
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,460
Actually, I don't...

467
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,660
That won't get me any further.

468
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,360
I don't know why we have it.

469
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,960
We've also been holding on to broken scissors two pairs.

470
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:32,960
the bone the bone this guy's fishing rod that we stole this crazy alcoholic apple juice fingerprint dust pocket sand can you imagine um elaborate floor ornaments wait but they're like different angles now that i look at it than what

471
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,640
Why do I... what am I supposed to do here?

472
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,820
Maybe I give the bone.

473
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,100
Eat up!

474
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,360
No, not a chance.

475
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,660
I'm more sure...

476
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, wait!

477
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,780
No way.

478
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,980
Oh, okay.

479
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,720
What about here?

480
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,780
Hmm.

481
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,240
That doesn't work.

482
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,240
There?

483
00:36:59,600 --> 00:36:59,960
Hmm.

484
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,240
Nothing's happening.

485
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:01,960
Root fullers?

486
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,780
No way.

487
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,180
No way.

488
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,860
I should think up something else.

489
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,220
Okay, just kidding.

490
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,020
What's this pole?

491
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,500
I just don't get why the tub was screwed to the metal bar.

492
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,440
Yeah, me neither.

493
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,060
Oh?

494
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,020
There's no point in that.

495
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,620
Oh, dang it, I thought it was to the bar.

496
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,960
They all have the burger icon pointing to the bar.

497
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,420
the center.

498
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,280
This one?

499
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,680
Which means, oh, you're right.

500
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,480
So this is all at the top.

501
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,900
This one and this one have the campfire on the correct side.

502
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,200
So does this one.

503
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,000
Are they all the same?

504
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,900
Wait a second, they're all the same.

505
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,500
Now I look.

506
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,860
Wait, they're all the same.

507
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,660
It's not like a pick the correct one.

508
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,920
Oh, my gosh.

509
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,720
I just...

510
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,160
What?

511
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,520
But it's different from the one that was at Sinclair's.

512
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,680
Um...

513
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,840
Hmm.

514
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,000
Doesn't fit.

515
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,320
Would have surprised me anyway.

516
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,780
Can you get in here?

517
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,800
Get in the tub.

518
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,000
And give us a show.

519
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,560
How again?

520
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,300
Another tub.

521
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,040
Empty again.

522
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,280
What else can I put in here?

523
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,680
No.

524
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,200
I would have...

525
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,260
only scratch everything.

526
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,020
Oh my god, he's still concerned about scratching everything with the needle.

527
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,980
And there's nowhere else for me to go.

528
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,820
Melanie, why won't you say anything?

529
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
I'm lost!

530
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,200
Random item into the tub.

531
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,280
We start from the case files.

532
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,600
That won't get me any further.

533
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,720
Think first, Brent.

534
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm trying.

535
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,260
No.

536
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:40,100
better not that is no important evidence I'm sure about that won't feel different with gloves either that won't get me any further oh it's got to be the fishing rod that won't help either think Brent think no better not better not I should think about it again I don't think it's anything you were on the right track to put the amulet in the tub I got a pixel hunt no way but like it's That would be stupid.

537
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,000
I should think up.

538
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,580
That does like.

539
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,000
There's no.

540
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,860
I can't think.

541
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,000
Looks like no way.

542
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,540
I don't want.

543
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,280
I should think.

544
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:46,700
No.

545
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,460
I thought that won't get me any further.

546
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,240
Think first, Brent.

547
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,380
Not a good idea.

548
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:52,880
That won't.

549
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,260
Hmm.

550
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,580
No.

551
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,220
I should think.

552
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,480
Looks like that won't work.

553
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,260
I don't want that.

554
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,800
I did look outside.

555
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,740
There was really nothing.

556
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:05,660
Hmm.

557
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,380
It would have surprised me if it had worked like that.

558
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,840
It wouldn't have surprised me.

559
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,060
That doesn't work.

560
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,340
That won't get me in no way.

561
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,240
I'd rather think that won't.

562
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:16,780
It won't work.

563
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,760
No, of course.

564
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,360
It can't work like that.

565
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,820
I'll have to grab the...

566
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,300
Wait.

567
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,680
Will it let me?

568
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,660
No, it won't let me grab the...

569
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,480
Wait, do I...

570
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,040
Oh, wait, or this board over here.

571
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,200
Wait, I can't...

572
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,180
I can't grab this board.

573
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,820
Um, am I getting one guide?

574
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,440
I can't tell.

575
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,720
Imagine being Melanie standing there listening to Brent talk, pass talk through.

576
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,160
Is that what work up?

577
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,630
Melanie followed.

578
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,670
Really strange this building?

579
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,070
There's, wait, no.

580
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,630
Really strange this building.

581
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,410
I'm talking about the building.

582
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,370
There's really nothing else over here.

583
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,510
Like out around here.

584
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,750
That looks like scales.

585
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,390
But what are they used for?

586
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,690
I keep thinking dragon skills.

587
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,370
I like how we like fade from existence when we...

588
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,310
Yeah, it won't let me pick up the board that's in front of the door.

589
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,330
So, maybe I got one guide.

590
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,610
I'm gonna look up a walkthrough.

591
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:53,040
The mystery of the druids walkthrough.

592
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,580
Oh, do we need help?

593
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,200
That's why I'm looking it up.

594
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,660
All good.

595
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,800
Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay.

596
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:13,980
Part four.

597
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,880
Wait, no, not part four.

598
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,660
We're at part...

599
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,510
Wait, huh?

600
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,190
Oh, wait.

601
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,250
Part 2.

602
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,430
Okay, part 3.

603
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,330
What?

604
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,300
Where does it start?

605
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,020
Oh, we're not at part 3 yet.

606
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,420
Okay.

607
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,680
Two planks.

608
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,540
Put the...

609
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,740
Put the amulet...

610
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,660
In the bucket.

611
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,140
Use the board to keep the door.

612
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:48,660
Yeah, yeah.

613
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,540
Oh, go!

614
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,200
Oh!

615
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:50,720
I have to go!

616
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,260
Go to the bucket.

617
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,800
Unscrew the screw outside of the left side of the bucket.

618
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,440
Oh my god.

619
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,780
Oh my god.

620
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,420
Wait.

621
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,600
This one?

622
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,660
It's so slow and it sounds horrible.

623
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,460
Hurry up!

624
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,780
And get the hook and screw.

625
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:20,640
Okay.

626
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,740
I also have to get the hook.

627
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,380
Okay, we got it.

628
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,800
Definitely knew that I...

629
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,960
If they needed this for their contraption, why did they not keep it in the room?

630
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,310
Squeak, squeak, squeak!

631
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,770
Click the board near the door to close the door.

632
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,270
It won't let me, though.

633
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,270
It really won't.

634
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:46,350
Oh, wait.

635
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:46,750
Wait.

636
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:47,730
This.

637
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,600
Hey, look at that.

638
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,480
This building.

639
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,680
is really something.

640
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,680
An hourglass.

641
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,680
This building is a card?

642
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Is that what the subtitles just said?

643
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,380
Wait!

644
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,160
Is this the time travel?

645
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,280
Oh my god.

646
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:07,860
Okay.

647
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,840
Alright, so I'm gonna not look at the walkthrough anymore until I need help.

648
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,300
I think probably I put this in here.

649
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,100
No?

650
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:15,700
Just kidding.

651
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,200
I put this in here.

652
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:18,520
No?

653
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:19,260
Okay, just kidding.

654
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,880
What do I do?

655
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,740
Wait a sec.

656
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,960
Eel?

657
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:46,920
I said I would not look until I need more help we're fine wait there's got to be more that I can look at no okay

658
00:44:50,680 --> 00:45:01,020
oh whoa why whoa it's like changes perspectives whoa whoa whoa What's this?

659
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,120
Does this let me leave?

660
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,980
Oh, oh, okay, it's telling me different directions.

661
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,800
Maybe I put the emulate in this side.

662
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,480
So what did I need these for?

663
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,690
The runes.

664
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,060
So there's two different sides.

665
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:38,720
Oh, I thought

666
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,180
Amulet.

667
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,880
And clicking on it.

668
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,080
Oh, he doesn't say anything.

669
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:55,490
Oh,

670
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,600
back to square one.

671
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,240
Oh.

672
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,530
Hold on.

673
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,420
It allows me to do something here.

674
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,740
So maybe we have to hook something in here.

675
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,560
Screw it, maybe?

676
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,220
What can I unscrew it with?

677
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:31,820
The nail.

678
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,020
Why doesn't he say anything?

679
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:34,800
I don't...

680
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:35,840
Ah!

681
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:40,350
Ah!

682
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,390
I can't see a key for the door of the tower room in Sinclair's villa.

683
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:45,730
Ew.

684
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,670
What the heck?

685
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:49,610
Oh, my gosh.

686
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:50,650
Wait.

687
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,270
Oh, wait.

688
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,090
Can I combine these?

689
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:53,930
Some phrase?

690
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,450
No way.

691
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,130
Why?

692
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:55,630
A hook.

693
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,090
What do you mean?

694
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,030
Why no way?

695
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:58,330
There's no point.

696
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:58,650
There's no point.

697
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,490
I don't want that.

698
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,110
Why no way?

699
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:06,790
way as if like this is totally I can't do that out of the question as if that's not how we just found them

Oh my god, Brent!

707

Brent!

708
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,580
I

709
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,960
think we're traveling through time

710
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:07,750
I had to take a second to to catch their breath, you know?

711
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:18,090
Good morning, Melanie Good morning, Brento

712
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,160
Why did that work?

713
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,400
We haven't moved even a single inch from where we started, have we?

714
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,860
Look, the bridge is a hole again.

715
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,160
If you ask me, the bridges are still hole.

716
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,660
We've landed in a time when this whole place was still completely intact.

717
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,320
They've gone to the cinema with me, we've traveled back in time.

718
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,560
Do you really think so?

719
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,160
Uh-oh, here comes company.

720
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:47,800
Oh.

721
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,020
Hello.

722
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,800
They look like soldiers.

723
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,640
Oh, panic.

724
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,420
Let's find out what they want.

725
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,400
Oh, I

726
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,280
must have fainted.

727
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,360
Where are we now?

728
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,260
What do you mean, fainted?

729
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,080
Friend, are you there?

730
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,620
Damn, where am I?

731
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,820
Looks like a kitchen.

732
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:21,660
Oh, my gosh.

733
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,300
She's just thinking everything all at once very quickly.

734
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,200
Oh, it looks like scales.

735
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:28,880
Like a dragon.

736
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:30,380
They're broken.

737
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,060
Oh, my gosh.

738
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,260
Does she not remember getting punched by...

739
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,420
A large cauldron.

740
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,860
There's some liquid in it.

741
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,660
What's in there?

742
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,320
Oh, the music is funky.

743
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,040
What's over here?

744
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,280
Oh, I got something?

745
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:45,980
What is this?

746
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:46,580
A weed.

747
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,980
Or maybe a herb.

748
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:49,900
It smells of menthol.

749
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,300
A weed!

750
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,560
These jugs smell good.

751
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,140
There must be dried leaves.

752
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,600
I don't know which plant they come from.

753
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,940
I'm grabbing everything.

754
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:01,500
Okay.

755
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,480
Uh, oh.

756
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,180
What we got?

757
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,240
I should concentrate.

758
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:12,980
Sorry, sorry.

759
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,440
This weed feels strange.

760
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,360
Almost like a sponge.

761
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,080
That smells of aniseed.

762
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,020
Those leaves are sort of fleshy.

763
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,780
Maybe they come from a herbaceous plant.

764
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,620
This herb smells of cinnamon.

765
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,240
Dried leaves.

766
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,320
Interesting.

767
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,540
We're gonna cook.

768
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,460
Did they put her in the kitchen because she's a lady?

769
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,080
They were like, who's this guy?

770
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:35,840
I don't know.

771
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,640
Take the female to the kitchen.

772
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,480
She'll finish supper.

773
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,240
Okay, we got a bowl.

774
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,560
Okay, we've got so much going on here.

775
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,400
Oh, what's this here?

776
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,660
What the hell?

777
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,960
We're just gonna ignore this drip?

778
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,760
What is that?

779
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,700
It is the past, after all.

780
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,620
That's what I'm saying.

781
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,080
There's no sense of organization here.

782
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,560
Maybe we make them a sleepy stew.

783
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,440
What is this?

784
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,460
Oh, okay.

785
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,860
What did I grab?

786
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,740
The medieval book of recipes.

787
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,720
Let's see what it says.

788
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,180
To make a good drink.

789
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,180
Wait.

790
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,760
To make a strange...

791
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,300
Slipping drink.

792
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,560
Wait, should we make them...

793
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,320
The sleeping drink or the meat or the good drink?

794
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,380
Minky.

795
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,260
That's me.

796
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,640
Maybe the sleeping drink.

797
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,960
What is a pate of fish?

798
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,640
When was the last day?

799
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,920
Great question.

800
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,160
Great question.

801
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,480
Let's save.

802
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,640
My game is so stretched now.

803
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,060
Minto 19.

804
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,540
Uh-oh.

805
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,280
Hopefully there's not a crazy strain of it.

806
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:04,980
Okay, hold on.

807
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,880
The medieval book of recipes.

808
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,880
Let's see what it says.

809
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:10,960
Fisk is fish?

810
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,100
Oh, it is?

811
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,400
Forever 19!

812
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,340
Let's see, let's try the sleeping one.

813
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:23,480
To make a strang slapping drank, tack 12 ounces of crimson and an ounce of the golden.

814
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,120
Mix 12 ounces of the green fram and... Oh, what the hell is this?

815
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,820
Wait, what?

816
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,080
Wait, what?

817
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,840
2 ounces of the crimson and an ounce of the golden.

818
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,000
Two ounce of the green fram, an ounce, and an ounce.

819
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,940
What does this mean?

820
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:55,700
No.

821
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,580
No, no, no, no, no, no.

822
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,500
Oh no, I didn't mean to press that.

823
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,080
Fish, fish scarring, skiering them.

824
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,800
Ooh, well, we don't have fish.

825
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,320
Oh my gosh, wait.

826
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,500
Okay, get me out of here, please.

827
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,520
What's...

828
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,740
Maybe I could start cooking.

829
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,660
I say this is water.

830
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,260
Oh, it's water, okay.

831
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,060
Two ounce of the golden?

832
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:30,300
This herb smells of cinnamon, dried leaves.

833
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,800
I don't know which plant they come from.

834
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,080
A weed, or maybe a herb.

835
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,140
This weed feels strange.

836
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,500
That smells of aniseed.

837
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,200
I don't... I don't know.

838
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,070
Is that blood on the ground?

839
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,510
Oh, oh.

840
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,030
Looks like there's been a feast here recently.

841
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:52,850
Wow.

842
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:54,770
Can I have some?

843
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:55,890
Hello.

844
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,650
What have we here then?

845
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:02,650
Look, John, the Danish whores woken up.

846
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:02,970
Oh,

847
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:06,510
point one.

848
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,150
Point one, I'm not a whore.

849
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,070
Point two, I'm not Danish.

850
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,390
Do you hear that?

851
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,710
She's got a sharp tongue in her head.

852
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:19,030
If you're not Danish, what are you?

853
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,230
That's none of your business.

854
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,630
That's none of your business.

855
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,510
Oh, isn't it?

856
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:36,850
You and your friend just come strolling into our kingdom right from the forbidden place, and it's none of our business to know who you are.

857
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:37,650
Danish pastry.

858
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:40,190
You have no right to hold us here.

859
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:41,870
We're just harmless travellers.

860
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:42,990
Let us go.

861
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,730
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

862
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:49,370
You two are staying right here until you've told us what your mission is.

863
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:52,630
when the invasion is due to begin.

864
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:53,130
Invasion?

865
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:54,790
What invasion?

866
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,330
What invasion, damn it!

867
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:59,470
I know nothing of an invasion, and neither does Brent.

868
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,590
You know very well what I'm talking about.

869
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:04,270
The next Danish invasion.

870
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,830
But I promise you this.

871
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:10,590
This time, King Ethel Red will be ready.

872
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,670
We will slaughter you the moment you set foot on English soil.

873
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:18,990
Um, I'm Dr. Melanie Turner.

874
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,110
Uh, I don't think he'll care about that.

875
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,030
My friend and I don't belong here.

876
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:25,790
We...

877
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:26,710
There you are.

878
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,090
A confession at last.

879
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,210
No, no.

880
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,650
What I mean is we don't belong to this time.

881
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,430
My God, is there no way I can get you to understand?

882
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:38,690
This is madness.

883
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,450
We're not Danish.

884
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,950
We're English.

885
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,850
We're English!

886
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:43,870
You are, are you?

887
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,190
Then tell me this.

888
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:46,230
Uh-oh.

889
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,950
Where in England did Edward the most...

890
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,210
martyr rule.

891
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:51,570
Who?

892
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,950
Damn it, how should I know?

893
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,410
I've never been interested in medieval history.

894
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:59,530
After all, all that ended over a thousand years ago.

895
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,870
Why is she acting like...

896
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:02,890
Is she stupid?

897
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,270
She's mad.

898
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,810
This woman's completely mad.

899
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,470
She's having us on.

900
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,070
Stop talking nonsense.

901
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,050
Was that in the books?

902
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,430
Tidy up and see you got something to drink.

903
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,690
He's not gonna care.

904
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:16,390
He's not gonna care.

905
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:17,770
What about this guy?

906
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,930
What are you staring at me for?

907
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,330
Never seen a woman before.

908
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:22,930
What's she mean, Thomas?

909
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,510
She means you're a fool, John.

910
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,290
What's she mean, Thomas?

911
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:33,690
I've never seen a lady before.

912
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:36,010
If I try to leave, will they kill me?

913
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,170
These lads seem to be pretty violent.

914
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:38,970
Hey!

915
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:39,250
Oh!

916
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:40,050
Stop!

917
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:42,190
You've no business going down there.

918
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:43,070
Do you hear?

919
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,490
You violated the law.

920
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,650
Yeah, isn't she an anthropologist?

921
00:57:49,970 --> 00:58:50,350

922
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:52,580
what's that?

923
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:57,070
Oh, a love potion.

924
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,930
Why would it...

925
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,110
A love potion?

926
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:00,750
Why would you say that?

927
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,610
I'm my own recipe.

928
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:07,890
Oh, well, that doesn't sound too vain.

929
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:08,770
Is he lonely?

930
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:12,530
You're not so much of a cow as I thought you were.

931
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:13,690
Is this not witchcraft?

932
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:18,850
To be honest, I've always had a soft spot for men who know what they want.

933
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:23,210
Hey, I like that.

934
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:28,870
Why don't you just come a little closer?

935
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:29,810
All right.

936
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,390
What'd you make of that, John?

937
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:35,270
It's quite tame, really.

938
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,870
What wonderful equipment you have, soldier.

939
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,630
Yes, isn't it just...

940
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:41,190
What's happening?

941
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:45,330
And it's all been christened with the blood of my enemies.

942
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:49,950
Take a good look, if you like, and then bring the...

943
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:54,810
that potion you were talking about you'll have to be patient i must brew it first

944
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:28,780

945
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,380
I've always found pictures of wars revolting.

946
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,740
This is so tame.

947
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,200
I like this guy's little club.

948
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,020
It's nice.

949
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,740
What's in here?

950
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:38,960
I might have guessed.

951
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,240
The door's locked.

952
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,000
Is that bread?

953
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,540
Looks like there's been a feast here recently.

954
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:45,520
Okay.

955
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,520
Yeah, they're dragon scales.

956
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:51,140
Finally.

957
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,780
Okay, so we need to fix this.

958
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,160
Oh, wait.

No?

966

Okay.

Okay, hold on.

Oh my god!

980
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:51,850
Well, my little dove, how's my potion give?

981
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:52,530
My little dove.

982
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:53,570
It's nearly ready.

983
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:55,470
I'll bring it along in a minute.

984
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:56,830
Okay, wait.

985
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,730
I have to get that money, though.

986
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:00,490
Is it this?

987
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:07,210
Thank you very much.

988
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:11,330
How many did I grab?

989
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:14,330
An old English coin weighing one ounce exactly.

990
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:16,390
But I need two ounces.

991
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:53,050
wait can I get another one wait hold on let's try no dang okay let's not talk to him because he might realize his his money's gone okay yes um all right let's look at this recipe one more time medieval book of recipes medieval what it says medieval slap and drank okay all right Alright guys,

992
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,250
let's put our brains together.

993
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:58,290
Two ounce of crimson, ounce of the golden.

994
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:01,490
Me...

995
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,330
It's...

996
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,730
What's a green fram?

997
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:04,830
That's the one thing.

998
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:06,710
I think the crimson...

999
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:09,770
Uh?

1000
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,060
This weed feels strange.

1001
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,800
Almost like a sponge.

1002
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,860
It doesn't help that they all look so similar.

1003
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,520
I don't know which plant they come from.

1004
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,620
Maybe this is golden, you know?

1005
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:38,260
it looks kind of gold right

1006
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,960
that's exactly one ounce of the herb okay

1007
01:06:52,140 --> 01:08:36,120
screw it we're gonna try the cinnamon as the Christmas of cinnamon we're gonna try the cinnamon as the crimson okay cinnamon right that's exactly one ounce of the herb okay one more okay I will save before I give this to them by the way don't worry right that's exactly one ounce of the herb okay the medieval book of recipes let's see what it says okay if Fram is from okay we got the two ounces of cinnamon and ounce of the golden mix the two of the green from an ounce and an ounce wait what wait what an ounce and an ounce do I mix them in here I should try and think of something else oh maybe this this cup what if you actually make a love potion I know okay we're just gonna stick that in my pocket this hot water this weed makes the water turn red okay but what what was that okay wait this is good now it's turned into a brown slop that's probably um that's probably the gold would turn it a little more right

1008
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,700
Yeah, slop!

1009
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,040
Give me more slop!

1010
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,200
Oh, oopsie.

1011
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:45,300
I just pressed the wrong thing.

1012
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,340
One moment, please.

1013
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,760
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1014
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,120
Okay, now I save.

1015
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,260
Save game.

1016
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,120
Me until 20.

1017
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:14,220
You guys are watching me grow up in real time.

1018
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:21,720
Wait, the brown slop is both correct and incorrect at once.

1019
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,040
The failure state for the puzzle looks exactly the same as the success.

1020
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,120
Well, here's hoping.

1021
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:33,950
Here you are, gentlemen.

1022
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,270
What's this revolting liquid?

1023
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,390
It looks like latrine water.

1024
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:39,990
Are you trying to poison us?

1025
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:40,530
No.

1026
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:56,090
he'll drink it here you are gentlemen what's this revolting liquid it looks like latrine water are you trying to poison us keep it i

1027
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:50,300
think this is probably a place to dump it yep that's what i figured okay okay let's see let's okay now though we know that we can test the herbs and see what color they make them so what we can do is well obviously i just want to see what color this was you know we gotta find the gold okay it's so slow though it's so slow all right exactly one ounce of the herb now the water is completely yellow is that not gold wait

1028
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,130
But it's not right.

1029
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:03,750
What the heck?

1030
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,450
Can I get rid of this?

1031
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:11,010
I wish I could so that I don't have to like...

1032
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:12,270
Then what about...

1033
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:14,030
This one?

1034
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,300
Read the recipe again.

1035
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:22,640
Why?

1036
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:31,260
Wait, when you do the mixing, you will have the brown color, but keep mixing and you get the correct potion.

1037
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:41,080
there's no point in that wait what the medieval book of recipes let's see what it says

1038
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:57,080
okay take two ounce of the crimson ounce of the golden mixing ounce uh

1039
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:08,320
I didn't say I needed to add more than two wait what wait

1040
01:12:15,560 --> 01:13:03,280
you only had two ounce in total you need three oh no what do you what do you mean I had two ounce of the I made the two ounce of the of the cinnamon I think from my understanding of this it's saying two ounces of the cinnamon two ounces of the golden and then mix the two ounces wait of the green what wait we just learned something to make it green though wait what what turned green what turned green was it this one the

1041
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:10,990
water in the bowl is absolutely clear okay Thank you.

1042
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:14,830
Okay, well, we know the red.

1043
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,230
Those leaves are sort of flat.

1044
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:18,770
This herb smells of cinnamon.

1045
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:21,130
Okay, so cinnamon is the other gold one.

1046
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:24,850
So, perhaps...

1047
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:33,790
Okay, what I'm going to do is add this immediately, because maybe it didn't count it as a second ounce as well, as what I was thinking, too.

1048
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:34,070
Right.

1049
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,890
That's exactly one ounce of the herb.

1050
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:38,070
So if I put it in now...

1051
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:39,990
This weed makes the water turn red.

1052
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:41,070
And now we do it again.

1053
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,590
This herb smells of cinnamon.

1054
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,330
So we do this.

1055
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,210
Oh, wait.

1056
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:49,610
I don't know which one turned green.

1057
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:54,830
Uh, that's fine.

1058
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:57,170
That's exactly one ounce of the herb.

1059
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,690
Okay, now I mix two.

1060
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,240
Combine.

1061
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:18,360
Okay, I'm looking it up.

1062
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:24,970
Cinnamon two ounces of weight.

1063
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:25,810
I have to do...

1064
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:29,570
Two ounces of the dried leaves, and then one ounce of aniseed.

1065
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:30,190
Was it this one?

1066
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:31,770
Those leaves are sort of flesh.

1067
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,010
That smells of aniseed.

1068
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:36,470
I remember I picked either this one or this one to just randomly throw into the bowl.

1069
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,910
Okay, so this is the...

1070
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:43,870
One ounce of this, and then we need two ounces of green.

1071
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:49,050
Spooky, welcome back!

1072
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:49,870
Thank you!

1073
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:50,970
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1074
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:53,630
That's exactly one ounce of the herb.

1075
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:54,010
Okay.

1076
01:14:56,150 --> 01:15:26,950

1077
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:34,150
Now I need two ounces of this, according to walkthrough Sama.

1078
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:39,870
That's exactly one ounce of the herb.

1079
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:54,920
According to the powers that have bestowed this knowledge upon me.

1080
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:55,460
Right.

1081
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:56,420
This is...

1082
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:57,380
That's exactly one...

1083
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,780
The water in the bowl is absolutely clear.

1084
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:05,060
did that nope that's not how that should uh color theory

1085
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:32,140

1086
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:33,920
Very tired.

1087
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,300
Sipi Han?

1088
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,760
Well, they're still drinking it.

1089
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,620
If I leave and go back, will they be asleep?

1090
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:43,700
No?

1091
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,860
Well, is it working yet?

1092
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,520
I can't feel anything yet.

1093
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:54,000
In fact, I'm still dog tired.

1094
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,640
Get us another one!

1095
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,220
I have to make it again!

1096
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,820
No, kid.

1097
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,540
Are you serious right now?

1098
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:03,840
No!

1099
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:10,570
Are you serious?

1100
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:13,430
Okay.

1101
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,650
Oh my gosh.

1102
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,430
This herb smells of cinnamon.

1103
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:20,930
Oh my god.

1104
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:22,950
Oh my god.

1105
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:24,210
Weeks of fun.

1106
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:25,410
Weeks of fun.

1107
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:28,370
Everybody, aren't you having just so much fun.

1108
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:32,450
Weeks and weeks and weeks of potion after potion.

1109
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:36,050
That's exactly one ounce of the This weed makes the water turn red.

1110
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:38,250
This herb smells of cinnamon.

1111
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:40,190
Weeks of fun!

1112
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:40,930
Weeks of fun!

1113
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:45,890
All his brain cells cooking!

1114
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:48,150
You'll never...

1115
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:51,270
You'll never want to play anything else!

1116
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,670
That's exactly one ounce of the herb.

1117
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,510
That smells of aniseed.

1118
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:05,810
Right.

1119
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:08,750
That's exactly one ounce of the herb.

1120
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:11,590
Weeks of fun!

1121
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,510
Weeks of fun!

1122
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:16,630
Devs considered this recipe really important.

1123
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:19,390
I guess we really just got it.

1124
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,450
We got to make sure they're knocked out.

1125
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:25,270
Oh, if only we were...

1126
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:27,430
That's exactly one ounce of the herb.

1127
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:32,310
If only we were Brent, we would give them the apple drink.

1128
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:38,770
My potions are too weak for me, traveler.

1129
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:40,090
Right.

1130
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:42,550
That's exactly one ounce of the herb.

1131
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:51,730
her the water in the bowl is absolute okay please fall asleep now that should do it sweet dreams my friends

1132
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:01,360
that should do it sweet dreams my friends

1133
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:20,670
why did I make a second one Brent Melanie at last I'm here over here over here at last wasn't I quick enough for you.

1134
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,890
This really is one hell of a rat's nest.

1135
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:24,090
Where are we anyway?

1136
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:26,630
I think this is an outpost of the British Army.

1137
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:30,350
It seems a number of wars were fought in this area a thousand years ago.

1138
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:31,110
Great.

1139
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:33,130
That's simply wonderful, isn't it?

1140
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:35,950
Maybe we should have read a few history books before we came here.

1141
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,210
Where are the soldiers now?

1142
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:38,210
Why are you getting so sniffy?

1143
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,770
Wait, his ears are totally intact.

1144
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:41,710
I made them a drink that seems to have had the desired effect.

1145
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:42,890
He has his... Well done, Melanie.

1146
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:44,270
Now let's get out of here.

1147
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:45,730
Unlock the door.

1148
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:47,790
Oh, I haven't.

1149
01:19:47,850 --> 01:19:48,210
The key.

1150
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:48,950
Oh.

1151
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:50,790
I haven't got the key.

1152
01:19:51,930 --> 01:19:52,830
Oh, great.

1153
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:54,670
You'd better look for it then.

1154
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:56,170
It must be around here somewhere.

1155
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:58,470
I'm really fed up with sitting in this hole.

1156
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,990
All right, all right.

1157
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:01,150
Calm down, will you?

1158
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:01,990
I'm looking.

1159
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,310
I'll be right back.

1160
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:04,030
Be quick.

1161
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:05,830
He's such a jerk!

1162
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:08,210
I would understand if he was like in...

1163
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:10,010
He certainly have enough weapons around here.

1164
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:11,030
If he was in pain, you know?

1165
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,150
He's well prepared for an invasion.

1166
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:14,650
Not that it's any of my business.

1167
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:18,110
But very clearly, they did nothing to his ears.

1168
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:20,650
They're empty.

1169
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:22,010
They're empty.

1170
01:20:22,210 --> 01:20:22,790
They're empty.

1171
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:25,770
What's in here?

1172
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,690
Wait, before I do this, I'm going to save.

1173
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:30,970
Save the game.

1174
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,450
I think we're 21 now.

1175
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,230
Oh my gosh.

1176
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:38,310
Oh!

1177
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:38,830
Oh!

1178
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:39,770
I saw a rat!

1179
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:42,070
I can't open it.

1180
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:43,430
Um.

1181
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:45,910
What about with...

1182
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:46,750
Okay, I have nothing.

1183
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:49,610
Okay.

1184
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:52,970
Uh...

1185
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:53,890
Grab that.

1186
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:55,970
Grab this.

1187
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:57,410
Grab this.

1188
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:59,090
To pry it open?

1189
01:20:59,210 --> 01:20:59,430
No?

1190
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:00,710
None of those are good ideas?

1191
01:21:01,450 --> 01:21:03,130
It's just hangry because there's no pizza.

1192
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:05,170
No pizza!

1193
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:08,050
Um...

1194
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:10,330
Anything here that could pry it open?

1195
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:10,790
This?

1196
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:12,750
I should try and think of something else.

1197
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:13,470
Weapons.

1198
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:15,010
Oh...

1199
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:16,110
Uh...

1200
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:18,890
What about this?

1201
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:20,110
No?

1202
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:23,970
Pizza.

1203
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:25,570
Pizza.

1204
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:27,630
This one?

1205
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:28,470
No?

1206
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:31,770
Ew.

1207
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:33,590
I might have guessed.

1208
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:34,870
The door's locked.

1209
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:38,530
Oh, I don't think the guards have the key.

1210
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,610
I think they want us to open that.

1211
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:43,270
I don't think I saw anything in here.

1212
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:44,850
Little ladle do?

1213
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:49,570
This thing?

1214
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:50,590
No, what?

1215
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:52,630
That looks perfect for opening a crate?

1216
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:58,570
At least we know there's no vampires in here.

1217
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,790
They certainly have enough weapons around here.

1218
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:10,070
Looks like they're empty.

1219
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:15,030
Nothing on this side, it seems.

1220
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,020
I can't open it.

1221
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,080
Okay.

1222
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,640
Door opening potion.

1223
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:28,980
Uh...

1224
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:31,140
Just...

1225
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:33,480
How you doing in there?

1226
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,740
Well, have you found the key?

1227
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:35,820
Not yet, Brent.

1228
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:36,820
But I will.

1229
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:37,160
I will.

1230
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:37,880
I hope so.

1231
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,020
We could use it to bust down the door.

1232
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:44,200
We could use it to open the bust down...

1233
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,060
I don't know.

1234
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,180
I don't know.

1235
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:47,860
Wait, oh wait!

1236
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:52,280
Oh, I keep thinking of items that Brent has.

1237
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,400
Ah, because I was like, oh, scissors.

1238
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,060
I don't know.

1239
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,040
Look at the little ragu.

1240
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,840
Can you search the men?

1241
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:01,820
I didn't see anything.

1242
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,480
Now let me search them.

1243
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,080
That should do it.

1244
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,240
Sweet dreams, my that should do it.

1245
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,000
Sweet dreams, my friends.

1246
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:16,740
Bones?

1247
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:18,820
Looks like there's been a feast here recently.

1248
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:28,160
Looks like there's been a feast here recently.

1249
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,920
Why can't you grab this?

1250
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:30,500
Weapon.

1251
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,720
It won't work like that.

1252
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,420
Why not?

1253
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,200
Why not?

1254
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:35,340
Why not?

1255
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,780
Is that a key right here?

1256
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,600
Looks like there's been a feast here recently.

1257
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:45,900
No, unfortunately.

1258
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:47,040
Good eye though.

1259
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,560
I saw your vision.

1260
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:59,540
And I have like, I only have herbs in my inventory, so there's nothing.

1261
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,300
Nothing that I can...

1262
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,140
Like, use the knife or something.

1263
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:12,680
Love potion on Brent, I wish.

1264
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,620
Guy loves himself too much.

1265
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:18,800
Well, already.

1266
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:26,010
Sorry, I had to wake up early today, and I'm a little sleepy.

1267
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:26,870
They're empty.

1268
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:28,050
They're empty.

1269
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:32,290
Okay, walk through.

1270
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:34,650
Tell me what you got.

1271
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,560
Wait, I do have to click...

1272
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,960
Wait, he does have the key?

1273
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:57,460
but where i did click on him what is it what is this what i did oh my god

1274
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:20,500
into the oh la la am i just like clicking the wrong things oh what just happened uh one second oh oh oh my bad

1275
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:26,350
My bud.

1276
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:27,410
We're fine.

1277
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:29,630
Oh, my game crashed!

1278
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:34,650
One second.

1279
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:40,890
Oops.

1280
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:44,070
No, no, no, no.

1281
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:47,230
Um, wouldn't this be so funny?

1282
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:50,490
No.

1283
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:53,250
Load game.

1284
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:55,350
21.

1285
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:07,920
weeks of fun no we're fine we're fine we have music again

1286
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:33,700
we're back where we were I accidentally pressed windows and every time you go out you tab out of the game it crashes the game guys I've had a bajillion and one problem setting up this game okay I can't open it.

1287
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,140
Maybe I have to get him out first.

1288
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:44,040
Maybe I do get him out and then I figure out what to do.

1289
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:50,000
But it was so worth it.

1290
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,220
I'm so happy to play this game.

1291
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,900
Okay, now how do we get out of here?

1292
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,180
The door's upstairs.

1293
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,400
Wait here.

1294
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,140
I'll go and see whether the key fits the other door.

1295
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,580
Look at him go- Oh, look how cute he is!

1296
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:08,560
Bing bong, bong.

1297
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,640
Feels a little laggy, but...

1298
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,240
Uh, this door?

1299
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,900
Wait, this door...

1300
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:18,660
This one?

1301
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,680
Here we go.

1302
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,480
It won't work like that, I don't think.

1303
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,160
You literally just said you would check.

1304
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:27,320
Don't bullshit me, Melanie.

1305
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,460
There's no other door.

1306
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:32,660
What do you mean?

1307
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,540
It won't work like that, I think.

1308
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,240
I'm gonna push you down these stairs.

1309
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:44,720
Okay, I'm just gonna say what I saw in the walkthrough.

1310
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,780
Give me a hand with this crate, Brent.

1311
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,500
It's too heavy for me to shift on my own.

1312
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:57,130
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

1313
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:58,810
Ah, just as I thought.

1314
01:27:58,950 --> 01:27:59,310
What?

1315
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:00,270
You can look at this, Brent.

1316
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:01,710
As you thought?

1317
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:03,270
I thought there must be more than just one way out of here.

1318
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:05,130
Looks like a secret passage.

1319
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:07,870
Just as I thought.

1320
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:09,230
Don't...

1321
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:30,970
pretty dark down there isn't it are you scared scared nonsense come on let's go there were torches upstairs we can we can we can go to oh oh we have to decide left or right you guys left or right left

1322
01:28:34,670 --> 01:29:15,690
Brent I'm here I can hardly see a thing neither can I maybe we ought to go back think rubbish there's no one here don't worry we'll find the way out left or right left or right maybe I should have saved before doing this left there's not a glimmer of light here anywhere Brent oh what was that are you still there Brent Brent this isn't funny hello is that you Brent oh wait was that a one wait what just happened

1323
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,440
damn it huh now where am i

1324
01:29:30,460 --> 01:30:45,320
oh no we're gonna get skeletonized this is all so familiar my head into that thank you very much this is all so familiar this is no use to an empty plate oh no i'd break my neck climbing down there storehouse and workshop the inner courtyard my arms aren't and work my arms aren't long enough my arms aren't long enough oh my god hello so you are the stranger who came to us through the gate of the world we meet at last i am very pleased to see he knows oh yes i can't say the feeling's mutual i want to get out of here this minute who are you anyway hush be calm nothing will happen to you here i am your friend my friend that's a lie i can do happened in there we need you you are the one all our hopes are hanging on what's that you've been expecting me that's impossible i came here from the year 2000 you can't even know i exist you came to us through the gate of the world not much has changed but we live underwater the course of history and your great great great grandson is eating humans

1325
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:51,560
right now i don't even know where i You are in a monastery, the final refuge of the last Druids of Britain.

1326
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,620
You have come to us in our greatest hour of need.

1327
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:55,980
We got to kill all you guys.

1328
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,800
Our order is facing extinction.

1329
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:02,740
For thousands of years, we have been handing our knowledge down from generation to generation.

1330
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:09,920
Every pupil was instructed by his mentor for 20 years, until he was worthy of being taught all the secrets of the Druids.

1331
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,140
And finally, he would become a mentor himself.

1332
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,160
I see.

1333
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:14,860
And?

1334
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,460
good or evil.

1335
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:22,440
The mentor's teaching alone determines which side will prevail.

1336
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,880
A pupil without a mentor is left to his own devices.

1337
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:32,320
He acts without wisdom or knowledge and thus becomes hungry for power and evil.

1338
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:35,460
Such a lust for power and evil.

1339
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,860
Okay that's old news so far.

1340
01:31:40,200 --> 01:32:09,560
Our Grand Master Sirsten killed his mentor and became evil yet he succeeded in becoming the leader he became evil he is now preparing a ritual mightier than any that has ever been performed he wishes to transfer the entire brotherhood's power he does look like five infants that guy just like the power of the druids will live on these infants will be stronger than any druid the world has ever seen a true descendant without a mentor.

1341
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,460
They are destined for evil.

1342
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,660
They will be tyrants.

1343
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:17,020
Mighty, immortal, invincible.

1344
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,020
Sounds familiar.

1345
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,660
Together, we can prevent this from happening.

1346
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:27,240
A small circle of brothers have united under my leadership with the intention of stopping Sursden.

1347
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:32,500
Alligat is a pupil without a mentor.

1348
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,620
His crimes make sense.

1349
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,020
But?

1350
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,920
Sursden seems to suspect something is going on.

1351
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:45,920
Ever since Since we occupied this monastery, he has been building fortifications to prevent anyone but himself from entering the places of worship.

1352
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:49,120
We know there is a secret room where he keeps a crystal ball.

1353
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,400
We also know that Searston has had our temples close to the river altered.

1354
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,860
With your help, we will get past its fortifications.

1355
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,720
Why do you need my help for that?

1356
01:32:58,900 --> 01:32:59,680
We are few.

1357
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,040
And Searston is having us watched.

1358
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,560
We need somebody of equal power to him.

1359
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:05,700
And you think that's me?

1360
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:10,500
Your journey here has given you the power to alter the course of history.

1361
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:10,740
True, true.

1362
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,540
That is more than any of us would be capable of doing.

1363
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,880
Find the room that harbors the crystal ball.

1364
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:22,820
I have arranged for you to be allowed to move freely within the monastery until the day of your execution.

1365
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:23,720
Execution?

1366
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,560
The day of my execution?

1367
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:32,900
Oh, great.

1368
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,400
Now you tell me.

1369
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,000
I must leave you now.

1370
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:38,500
I bid you good luck.

1371
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:39,900
Hey, where will I find you?

1372
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:40,960
Thank you, Naomi Hunter.

1373
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,060
I am called Maglore.

1374
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:44,020
Maglore.

1375
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:45,380
Oh, great.

1376
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:46,600
Naomi Hunter!

1377
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,540
That is, if I ever get to tell him.

1378
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:50,700
And Melanie will...

1379
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:51,140
Hold on.

1380
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:52,280
Where did she get to?

1381
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:53,360
Melanie!

1382
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,800
Oh my gosh.

1383
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:57,040
Can I take a nap?

1384
01:33:59,080 --> 01:33:59,940
What am I doing?

1385
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:01,620
Oh, just stuffing that in my pocket.

1386
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,400
A bed hard as rock.

1387
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:47,410
oh what is that a bird's nest that little fellow can fly I can't I'll never get there like this the Naomi hunter's first descendant there's a bird's nest on the chimney can we call the bird I'd have to go down there to do anything it's too far away there are vegetables growing over there look at that island too far away the sea the sea the sea is quite calm why it said it's silent as a grave but the subtitle the sea is quite calm i think they started getting a little lazy towards the end of the game well he said that i can leave so

1388
01:34:53,530 --> 01:35:06,780
melanie oh magle maglore is that your name when i'm when you are there you are i've been looking for you have you discovered anything yet i have to learn how to find my way around here first.

1389
01:35:07,060 --> 01:35:09,040
Don't you think you might be able to show me around the monastery?

1390
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,260
Out of the question.

1391
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:12,240
We should not be seen together.

1392
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:15,700
We will make sure that Sirstan's spies do not bother you.

1393
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:18,480
Everything else is up to you.

1394
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:19,780
How long do I have?

1395
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:21,400
What have you done with Melanie Turner?

1396
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,960
What have you done with Melanie Turner?

1397
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:23,860
She is safe.

1398
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:24,380
She is true.

1399
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:25,120
It's magic.

1400
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,180
What do you mean for the moment?

1401
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,820
What do you mean for the moment?

1402
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:32,940
The day of her execution is the same day when your life will end.

1403
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:34,680
That sounds really encouraging.

1404
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,160
A double execution.

1405
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:36,940
so to speak.

1406
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:37,920
And when will that be?

1407
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:42,220
Serstan has decreed that the day of the ritual shall be the day you both die.

1408
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:42,680
Oh.

1409
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,700
Where's Melanie now?

1410
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:45,000
Yeah.

1411
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:47,000
She may move freely within the monastery.

1412
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,500
Okay, okay.

1413
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:48,340
Just like you.

1414
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,780
I have been to see her and told her everything.

1415
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:52,520
I do not know where she is now.

1416
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:53,760
Oh, so she's just wandering around too?

1417
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,560
I believe she wanted to take a look around the library.

1418
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:56,360
The library?

1419
01:35:56,780 --> 01:36:00,100
We are sentenced to death and Melanie Turner goes to look at the library?

1420
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:00,920
Okay.

1421
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:02,560
I'm sure I'll find her.

1422
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:04,060
See you later.

1423
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:04,800
I'll see you later.

1424
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:38,280

1425
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,220
Oh my gosh, this place is huge.

1426
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:46,200
What is this?

1427
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,060
Not a pretty sight.

1428
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:49,720
No.

1429
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:50,860
What is it?

1430
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:51,200
That?

1431
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:52,880
What is- What is- what is this?

1432
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,360
This place isn't- Crates.

1433
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,420
Perfectly ordinary crates.

1434
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:59,800
This place isn't infested with rats.

1435
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,480
It's too high up.

1436
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,740
It's too high up.

1437
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:05,700
It's too high up.

1438
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:07,180
Anyway, it's- Oh my god, another one!

1439
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:08,380
Oh my god.

1440
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:08,380
Another one!

1441
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,020
Okay, let's check...

1442
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:17,500
Wait, oh, before...

1443
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:18,000
Turn around?

1444
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,860
Wait, I want to look at the paintings, too.

1445
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:23,000
This wouldn't make my room look much better.

1446
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:25,860
A medieval scene?

1447
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,840
Quite the commentary this guy has.

1448
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:35,660
A musical presentation.

1449
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,300
This wouldn't make my room look much better.

1450
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:39,640
What does that mean?

1451
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:45,500
Um...

1452
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:49,570
Oh...

1453
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:52,750
What is this over here?

1454
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:55,610
Wow.

1455
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,030
These are solid iron.

1456
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:00,350
These are solid iron.

1457
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:01,450
Okay.

1458
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:03,770
Spooky room.

1459
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:06,030
All right.

1460
01:38:06,190 --> 01:38:06,650
What about this?

1461
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:08,390
Oh, can't go in there.

1462
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:09,190
What about here?

1463
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:12,830
Solid.

1464
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:16,410
Can I take this sheet too?

1465
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:17,530
I'm not the least bit tired.

1466
01:38:17,710 --> 01:38:18,190
It's a bed.

1467
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:18,810
It's a bed.

1468
01:38:18,890 --> 01:38:19,730
But why is it like...

1469
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,610
I can't light it.

1470
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:22,270
I'd need wood.

1471
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:22,670
It's kind of red.

1472
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:25,430
Am I the only one seeing that?

1473
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:26,390
It's too high up.

1474
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:27,730
Anyway, it's barred.

1475
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:28,670
Okay.

1476
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:29,970
What are these?

1477
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:31,130
Ah, books.

1478
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:33,670
Too bad I wouldn't be able to understand a word of them.

1479
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:34,130
Ah!

1480
01:38:34,570 --> 01:38:36,390
Oh, Halligan can't read!

1481
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:39,950
Ah, books!

1482
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:41,370
Oh!

1483
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,440
You there!

1484
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,540
You think that was a spy spying on me?

1485
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:02,740
I think that was a spy.

1486
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:34,200
suspicious they just get in my way they're just stones why would they get in my way why would they get in your way they just get in my way why oh my gosh this place looks very much like a workshop the music is okay hold on I don't want to go outside just yet let's finish inside maybe it's Ricky Martin okay there's this door here and then there's even more?

1487
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:36,580
Oh my gosh, okay.

1488
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:37,360
Ah!

1489
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,020
Oh.

1490
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,660
Okay, no, he wasn't a bad guy, guys.

1491
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:42,360
He's fine.

1492
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:03,030
It's only just days before execution.

1493
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:08,530
I'm sure sitting on that would be considered a serious offense.

1494
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:10,690
I don't think I ought to do it.

1495
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:14,150
What?

1496
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,820
I'd better leave that here.

1497
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,420
Oh, the tonal whiplash.

1498
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:29,680
Does this like make shit?

1499
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:34,400
No, I was going to say shadows or something, but it doesn't seem to.

1500
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:36,040
I actually have no idea.

1501
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,480
Is this a...

1502
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:37,620
Wait.

1503
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:41,080
Oh, I messed up.

1504
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,180
Wait, is that where it's supposed to go?

1505
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:46,640
I sure hope so.

1506
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,120
The abacus, that's what I was thinking of.

1507
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:53,220
What's in here?

1508
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,160
An old library.

1509
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:57,640
Oh!

1510
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,420
Filled with the typical smell of old leatherbound books.

1511
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:03,720
Hi, Melanie.

1512
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:06,060
I'll be back.

1513
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:10,320
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1514
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:12,940
Back to spooky.

1515
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:14,920
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1516
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,440
Why is the library...

1517
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,840

Oh.

1521
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:38,410
Not very easy to handle.

1522
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:40,030
I'd better leave them here.

1523
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:42,350
They are spears.

1524
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:44,150
No, I'm trying to talk to the man!

1525
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:46,430
A dining tea.

1526
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:48,150
It's big.

1527
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:51,370
That's a lot of crockery.

1528
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:52,910

01:42:52,910 --> 01:42:55,750

1535
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:10,930
This is just, that's just a guy with a voice changer.

01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:16,770
Come to offer you a deal.

1537
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:17,270

Wait, I can't, I can't leave.

No, I wanted to save.

1540
01:44:20,850 --> 01:44:21,990
Oh gosh, I should have saved.

1541
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:23,410
What are you planning to do to us?

1542
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:29,870
When the great day has come and the ritual has been perfected, your lives will end.

1543
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,870
Why don't you just kill us right now?

And then you will die.

1547
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:13,530
A great honor will be bestowed upon you.

1548
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:18,850
You will be the last sacrifices of the old world.

1549
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:23,830
You're mad, completely insane.

1550
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:28,510

01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:33,170
Wait, can I leave, please?

1552
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:36,870

01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:38,910
I've come to offer you a deal.

A deal?

1556
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:43,350
You are offering me a deal?

1557
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:45,630
You overrate your importance.

1558
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:48,350
I will not do deals with you.

1559
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:48,990
Dang.

1560
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:52,670
I know something that you can't know.

1561
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:55,850
I know something that you can't know.

1562
01:45:56,170 --> 01:45:57,270
What might that be?

1563
01:45:57,470 --> 01:46:01,470
I won't tell you until you give me your word that you will let me and my friend go.

1564
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,150

1566
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:36,620
good.

1567
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,440
Well, we've done a lot of exploring.

1568
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,700
It would really suck to accidentally crash the game.

1569
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:42,340
Oh, okay.

1570
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,620
What are these, marbles on the ground?

1571
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:47,980
Someone's losing their marbles.

1572
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:49,200
Can I take your blanket?

1573
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,000
A druid's bed.

1574
01:46:51,580 --> 01:46:51,640
Huh.

1575
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:53,680
It's a druid's bed.

1576
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,140
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1577
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:57,280
It's locked.

1578
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:57,880
Dang it.

1579
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:58,660
Bad luck.

1580
01:46:59,060 --> 01:46:59,360
A crate.

1581
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:00,560
Bad luck.

1582
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:04,760
Dude's talking like a MF Doom sample.

1583
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:15,420
This place is nonsensical.

1584
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:19,600
Do these guys, like, not vacuum?

1585
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:21,620
Take it.

1586
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:22,960
A basket?

1587
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:24,420
That's empty.

1588
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:29,120
I like when the music is spooky.

1589
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:30,280
It really sets the tone.

1590
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:31,740
And then it's...

1591
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:35,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1592
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:39,540
Gosh.

1593
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:43,620
It wraps around.

1594
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:44,300
Okay.

1595
01:47:44,300 --> 01:48:47,300
all right so we can go talk to Melanie what if I go back in there we can go talk to Melanie and we can go outside those are our two options now what you want oh are you so eager to die your death will come soon enough now get out one moment please just one short moment may I ask you one more question you do not need to ask questions it would be a waste of time answering you you would not understand the answers anyway i'll chance that you must think you're very clever just like all fools you will soon understand just how pointless each of your actions sentences and thoughts have you seen very soon now my power will be multiplied and i will continue to exist within it it will make me immortal and you will be no more than a pile of dust that the wind will carry out to sea.

1596
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:51,420
Um.

1597
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:53,960
What was I getting?

1598
01:48:54,020 --> 01:49:04,800
Oh, it's like in Colombo when the person that did it gets really upset by Colombo just being an annoying little guy.

1599
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:07,900
And that's what we're doing here.

1600
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:12,080
I've heard your order is facing its downfall.

1601
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:49,080
that from whom from a fool like yourself our order is not facing its downfall but a great new beginning even if some of my brothers disliked the idea or did you think I did not know of the ridiculous conspiracy that some of my misguided brothers have set up they have told you of it haven't they I do not expect you to betray them but they are greatly mistaken where their abilities and they underestimate me.

1602
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:53,020
I will soon find out which of my brothers are betraying me.

1603
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:57,340
And I will destroy them without even lifting a finger.

1604
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,780
The path I have determined cannot be altered.

1605
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,480
Our fate is sealed.

1606
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,080
Now get out of my sight.

1607
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:06,520
You bore me.

1608
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:08,540
You don't even let me get a...

1609
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:11,700
I bore you because you don't let me get a sentence in.

1610
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:14,820
Um, okay.

1611
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:18,600
This one was the kitchen.

1612
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:20,840
Okay, here is where Melanie is.

1613
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:21,780
Ready for music?

1614
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:27,680
It sounds like Sims shopping music or something.

1615
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,600
Hello, Melanie.

1616
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:36,460
How's it going?

1617
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:38,320
I found a few more chronicles.

1618
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:42,480
One of them describes all the details of the heathen practices in this region.

1619
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:46,560
The monks kept an eye on them because the heathens were their competition, you might say.

1620
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:48,380
What were these heathen practices?

1621
01:50:48,940 --> 01:51:45,740
think i ought to tell you you wouldn't be too pleased oh right i get it thanks for being so considerate i think i've heard enough stories of cannibalism to last me a few years thank you very much how are you getting on i need a bit more time the monastery is rather large and it's hard not to get lost also i keep finding some druid or other following me around we don't have much time brent what can i do i haven't found the room with the crystal ball yet let alone a way out of here it's probably behind that spooky room we found anything about the druids why is the music so like it's so sad it's so heartfelt it's making me feel things have you found anything about the druids in these books nothing we didn't already know it talks a lot about the transformation of the four elements Mr. Blake told you all about that,

1622
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:46,200
didn't he?

1623
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:47,260
Yes, that's right.

1624
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:48,640
You've got to hand it to him.

1625
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:50,200
He'd done his homework all right.

1626
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:54,860
I've found everything he said about the four elements in the Christian monk's original texts.

1627
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:57,700
I don't see how the elements are going to be of any help to us.

1628
01:51:57,860 --> 01:51:59,300
Anything can be useful, Brent.

1629
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:00,860
I just thought I'd mention it.

1630
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:02,500
Do you remember what Blake told you?

1631
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:02,580
Yeah.

1632
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:03,260
Peeping music.

1633
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:05,780
Oh.

1634
01:52:05,780 --> 01:52:06,480
Remind me.

1635
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:07,960
Now what was it?

1636
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:09,420
Remind me.

1637
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:13,440
The Druids believed that the four elements were the stuff that made up the world.

1638
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,520
I might have stopped listening to Mr. Blake.

1639
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:17,180
The three basic elements.

1640
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:21,480
Fire's only purpose was to transfer one element into the state of another.

1641
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:21,760
Okay.

1642
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,360
Which means?

1643
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:25,400
Fire will turn solids or liquids into gas.

1644
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:25,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1645
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,560
Fire can turn a gas into a liquid.

1646
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:30,980
Take a combination of oxygen and hydrogen, for instance.

1647
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:33,080
Fire stands for transformation.

1648
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:36,480
The transfer of material into a new state.

1649
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,240
It's not that difficult, is it?

1650
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:39,860
Oh.

1651
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:43,060
Could I ask you something personal?

1652
01:52:44,740 --> 01:52:47,980
Melanie, could I ask you something personal?

1653
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,600
Do you really think this is the right time?

1654
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,360
No, probably not.

1655
01:52:52,740 --> 01:52:55,040
But who knows if I'll ever get another chance to ask you.

1656
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:56,100
Well, what is it?

1657
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:56,880
I'm curious.

1658
01:52:58,620 --> 01:52:59,380
Oh, no.

1659
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:00,620
Oh, no.

1660
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,560
No, we're going to do...

1661
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:03,380
No, never mind.

1662
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:04,900
Forget it.

1663
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,240
I'm so dark and mysterious.

1664
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:08,660
If we ever get out of here alive...

1665
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:09,340
No way.

1666
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:10,020
Wait.

1667
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:11,660
Which one do I do?

1668
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,080
No, you wouldn't.

1669
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:18,040
Do we play hard to get or do we play pathetic?

1670
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,500
Riz her?

1671
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:23,740
If we ever get out of here alive...

1672
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:23,860
Yes.

1673
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:25,200
Would you...

1674
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:27,520
I mean, could you ever bring yourself to...

1675
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:28,280
The cinema.

1676
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,240
Go to Al's Pizza Palace for a pizza with you?

1677
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,700
Yes, I think I'd like that.

1678
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:33,600
Hey, how did you guess?

1679
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:35,120
Do you know Al's Pizza Palace?

1680
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:36,840
I've never been there, Brent.

1681
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:41,240
But when I went to Scotland Yard to look for you, I took a look at your office.

1682
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,920
I couldn't miss the boxes.

1683
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:43,340
No.

1684
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,760
Oh, I see.

1685
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:46,800
A bit untidy in there, isn't it?

1686
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:48,280
You could say that.

1687
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:49,080
Yes.

1688
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:51,680
I should try and tidy up in there sometime.

1689
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:53,120
But you'd come with me?

1690
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:54,580
I told you, yes.

1691
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:55,200
Right.

1692
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:56,360
It's a deal.

1693
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:57,740
I'll remind you about it.

1694
01:53:57,980 --> 01:53:58,820
Okay, Brent.

1695
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,280
I'm looking forward to it.

1696
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:03,820
But it might be an idea if we try to get out of here alive first.

1697
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:04,700
What do you think?

1698
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:05,000
What do you think?

1699
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:05,920
Of course.

1700
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:06,980
I'm sure we will.

1701
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:08,960
Oh, my God.

1702
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:09,420
Oh, my God.

1703
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:10,040
Okay, Melanie.

1704
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:11,020
I'll go on looking.

1705
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:11,680
Good luck.

1706
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:12,160
It worked.

1707
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:12,760
It worked.

1708
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:13,320
It worked.

1709
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:16,420
We're gonna go get Alice Pizza Palace with Melody!

1710
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:20,500
Oh, I can't believe she saw...

1711
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,440
She saw...

1712
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,860
Oh, I forgot about the music.

1713
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,440
She saw our mess of an office and still agreed.

1714
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,400
Do you think she knows that I think it's a date?

1715
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:38,780
Do you think she knows that?

1716
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:40,360
I'm thinking it's a date.

1717
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:43,080
I'll have to go a bit closer to do anything there.

1718
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:43,420
Oh, here we go.

1719
01:54:43,440 --> 01:55:17,730
though a water oh no making Melanie pay is 275 pounds yeah I don't think they want me back there Melanie salad salad I hate salad I hate Salad.

1720
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:21,090
Sorry, it totally caught me off guard!

1721
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:22,990
The inner courtyard is bigger than I thought.

1722
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:26,310
Oh my god!

1723
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:28,030
I hate salad.

1724
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:29,390
Salad.

1725
01:55:30,050 --> 01:55:31,330
Simple wooden buckets.

1726
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:32,550
They're all empty.

1727
01:55:32,850 --> 01:55:36,870
Oh gosh, this game is so something.

1728
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:38,430
These could be the stables.

1729
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:40,070
What a special game.

1730
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:43,150
Of some melons.

1731
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:45,630
I hate melons.

1732
01:55:47,230 --> 01:56:16,990
that's just not my style what does that even mean it's a pitchfork what do you what do you mean it's not your style oh my gosh i feel like i'm missing so much oh anyone in there i don't have a key the door's bolted not a chance okay what's what is oh is this like the water reservoir for the garden okay i'm guessing i don't see anything unusual down there okay uh

1733
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:37,090
it's not it's like a whole head of cabbage or lettuce or whatever and he's like i hate salad what's this there's a definite smell of stables here uh

1737
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:10,100
Halligan definitely gets sardines What did they do to you ten lashes of the whip?

1738
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:11,700
My bare back.

1739
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:14,660
Oh my god I've lied down for three weeks.

1740
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:17,580
I've given up asking questions since then.

1741
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:19,600
I can't hear you over the whimsical music

1742
01:59:23,700 --> 02:00:28,620
but they are powerful and cruel I have to finish my work by tomorrow or else I'll be punished in some horrible way tell me about the druids I don't know much about them anyway I'm not allowed to tell you anything ah that's interesting look stranger I don't know about you but I'm quite attached to my head I don't fancy being slaughtered because you're so nosy oh my goodness oh my goodness then why is it so urgent why is your work so urgent i don't really know myself why they need this stuff so quickly is it for the ritual helping to prepare some big ceremony affairs anyway they keep strengthening their fortifications to make it so he can't do his job have you noticed anything unusual around here lately unusual no not really except that it's extremely quiet in the monastery oh hang on yeah yeah there was I heard children crying two days ago.

1743
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:30,360
It was after dark.

1744
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:36,260
I couldn't see much, but I think the crying was coming from one of those private rooms.

1745
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:38,400
Did it sound like babies crying?

1746
02:00:39,260 --> 02:00:40,200
Yeah, it did.

1747
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,360
Just like that.

1748
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,120
Interesting.

1749
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:43,680
Did you notice anything else?

1750
02:00:44,060 --> 02:00:44,220
No.

1751
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:45,540
No, nothing.

1752
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:46,740
Why do you ask?

1753
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:48,440
Just asking.

1754
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:50,100
A ceremony.

1755
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:51,400
A ceremony?

1756
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:52,000
Yeah.

1757
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,840
of some sort.

1758
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:55,540
Don't ask me what it's all about.

1759
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,240
I don't know anything about their heathen religions.

1760
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,920
I was brought up a Christian.

1761
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:03,200
There's hardly any Druids left in Britain these days anyway.

1762
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:04,160
Except here.

1763
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:06,280
Except here is all of them.

1764
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:11,000
I already asked about anything unusual, so...

1765
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,400
I'll have a look around if you don't mind.

1766
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:12,980
All right.

1767
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:14,220
Go ahead.

1768
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:17,940
So...

1769
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:21,380
Do we want to help him or do we want to sabotage them?

1770
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,820
Oh, look at this.

1771
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:24,700
Is this blood?

1772
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:27,140
I don't have anything that I need to die.

1773
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:29,140
Looks like a tub of dye.

1774
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:31,320
They're too far away.

1775
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,240
I don't want to get into trouble.

1776
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:33,820
Uh-huh.

1777
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:37,160
I... Oh!

1778
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:39,500
Oh, yes.

1779
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:40,640
This looks familiar.

1780
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:41,580
It's the symbol.

1781
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:43,680
I wonder what this symbol stands for.

1782
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:46,160
It's... it's... it's the campfire!

1783
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:49,480
Okay, how do I get out of here, actually?

1784
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:54,440
Uh, which, oh, this way.

1785
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:58,240
Let's continue searching around.

1786
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:00,780
We were going this way.

1787
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:03,380
These must be the stores.

1788
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:04,640
There's a lot of stuff here.

1789
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:05,700
The stores.

1790
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:08,580
Oh, what did I just take?

1791
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:10,080
Oh, just some wood.

1792
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:11,360
A little piece of wood.

1793
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:15,000
We're just gonna take that and put it in my pocket for...

1794
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:18,140
Unknown reason.

1795
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:21,980
Other things he's...

1796
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:54,140
like nah this cramps my style they're just empty crates but no this little piece of wood i like it they are just empty crates well you could bring it back and be like look at this this is wood from from thousands of years ago and it looks brand new and they'd be like oh you got it you're right looks a bit too creepy for my liking i think i'll steer clear of the shed but it could have things that we need to know about in there they are just empty Okay,

1797
02:02:54,940 --> 02:02:54,940
stupid.

1798
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:55,720
This guy.

1799
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:57,280
Just a box.

1800
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:01,360
Yeah, what if we have our back turned and it starts moving around?

1801
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:15,280
Um, so, uh, like I said earlier, I'm going to consult the walkthrough because we've just been introduced to at least 20 rooms.

1802
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:22,500
So, um, yeah, wait a second.

1803
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:23,640
In the candle room.

1804
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:46,760
pixel hunting get some candles okay so we missed candles I got the roots in the black bucket goodness gracious he wants to do it is this a piece of wood in your pocket no what was a candle room there was a candle room

1805
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:58,120
wait I'm gonna do a new save sorry just in case for whatever reason

1806
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:03,700
Candle room.

1807
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:10,910
Will you be streaming Silent Hill?

1808
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:11,690
Yeah, tomorrow.

1809
02:04:14,170 --> 02:04:15,330
Is this a candle room?

1810
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:17,010
This room has candles.

1811
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:19,250
Wait, no, this is your room.

1812
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:20,770
Just kidding.

1813
02:04:21,790 --> 02:04:23,410
This was where I came from.

1814
02:04:24,090 --> 02:04:25,470
What was the candle room?

1815
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:34,260
Not candle room.

1816
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:45,560
I don't think that's a candle room.

1817
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:51,060
I don't think this is the candle room.

1818
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:53,800
This is probably the blue room.

1819
02:04:56,720 --> 02:04:57,160
I think.

1820
02:04:58,100 --> 02:04:59,140
Candle room.

1821
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:01,220
What room was this?

1822
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:02,360
Wait, what's this one?

1823
02:05:09,790 --> 02:05:10,490
Is it?

1824
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:13,250
Oh, oh, we didn't even go in here.

1825
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:14,070
No one will notice they're missing.

1826
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:18,710
No wonder I didn't know what a candle room was.

1827
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:19,970
Very efficient weapons.

1828
02:05:22,270 --> 02:05:23,510
of candles in here.

1829
02:05:24,290 --> 02:05:24,730
Good grief.

1830
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:26,090
Why is that an issue?

1831
02:05:26,450 --> 02:05:26,850
Good grief.

1832
02:05:27,490 --> 02:05:29,190
There must be hundreds of candles in here.

1833
02:05:29,570 --> 02:05:32,290
Okay, so we got candles and we've got...

1834
02:05:32,290 --> 02:05:33,690
Okay, candles and the wood.

1835
02:05:36,430 --> 02:05:39,250
Outside near the crops is where we need to go.

1836
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:40,690
Okay.

1837
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:43,010
Minto.

1838
02:05:43,550 --> 02:05:44,370
That's me!

1839
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:47,490
That's me.

1840
02:05:47,670 --> 02:05:48,710
That's my name.

1841
02:05:49,730 --> 02:05:50,510
Don't wear it.

1842
02:05:50,570 --> 02:05:52,150
How did I miss that room?

1843
02:05:52,270 --> 02:06:26,470

1844
02:06:30,040 --> 02:07:16,130

1845

1846
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:43,700
Worms.

1847
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,200
What?

1848
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:51,440
It's a druid's biggest weakness.

1849
02:07:51,860 --> 02:07:53,020
I'd better turn it off again.

1850
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:53,960
Wait, what?

1851
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:58,240
Are they poisonous worms?

1852
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:01,220
Are we gonna make poison worm soup?

1853
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:07,140
And they will all Um, what?

1854
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:10,600
Oh,

1855
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:18,790
grab those worms.

1856
02:08:21,970 --> 02:08:22,730
Huh.

1857
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:26,250
Why did I get those?

1858
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:37,060
Okay, okay.

1859
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:38,000
I've...

1860
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:38,760
Oh, I...

1861
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:38,940
Okay.

1862
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:42,820
Remember, we saw that bird's nest.

1863
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:45,780
The bird might want worms.

1864
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:50,660
Apparently the bird is up here.

1865
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:52,780
But how do I...

1866
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:53,600
Wait, okay, hold on.

1867
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:56,440
Use the worms on the bird's nest.

1868
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:00,980
But they're so far up.

1869
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:06,540
Right click on the right side of the roof.

1870
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:08,620
Wait, maybe I'm from this side.

1871
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:12,280
Aha!

1872
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:14,820
There's a bird's nest up on the chimney.

1873
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:48,370
I'll never be able to reach it from here of the worms i can think of better ways of using the worms i can't what are you talking about i can think of better ways of using the worms here's the worms on the roof away from the nest oh here i can think of better ways of using the worms um if you think a guy is fine you're trying to cram weeks of fun into a few streams after all so true maybe this side

1874
02:09:56,750 --> 02:10:12,050
the walkthrough says use the worms click the right hand side of the roof use worms on the roof away from the nest so the birds has to leave the nest huh

1875
02:10:15,750 --> 02:11:26,230
it did say though that I have to exhaust all the dialogue with this guy maybe I didn't I'd like to ask you a few more things concerning our talk well keep it short um it's pretty hazy in here it's pretty smoky in here do you know that of course i know a damn fire keeps going out ever seen a smith who could work without the fire what's the matter does the rain get in oh what do i know oh maybe the birds are always problems with the fire in here nothing works but everything's supposed to be finished the bird's nest is ruining the fire that's why scotland yard's not Scotland yard where's that and Scotland no no let's just say it's a place it takes a long time to get to mmm all I know is the settlements on the other side of the river and I curse the day I left them to come here I should have stayed in the village okay I'd be better off in London what village what village east of the river I was born there and I lived there until I came here asking for work that was a big mistake I thought

1876
02:11:26,230 --> 02:11:32,590
I could earn some money here to feed my family what happened I became a slave to those druids

1877
02:11:36,010 --> 02:11:45,670
you think you'll be able to get me I think you might be able to help me get out of here I'd have to be pretty stupid to try that I had to pledge loyalty to Sirsten when I came here.

1878
02:11:46,070 --> 02:11:46,470
Sirsten!

1879
02:11:46,890 --> 02:11:48,130
That guy's silly.

1880
02:11:48,670 --> 02:11:49,670
Come and go.

1881
02:11:51,190 --> 02:11:51,590
Okay.

1882
02:11:51,790 --> 02:11:52,250
I see.

1883
02:11:54,050 --> 02:11:57,710
Oh well, looks like there's nothing I can do for you or that you can do for me.

1884
02:11:58,010 --> 02:11:59,610
I'm really sorry, stranger.

1885
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:00,190
Aww.

1886
02:12:00,190 --> 02:12:02,870
I have enough problems here, isn't it?

1887
02:12:02,870 --> 02:12:03,550
He's a good guy, maybe.

1888
02:12:03,810 --> 02:12:05,490
I really can't do with any more.

1889
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:06,350
I think he's good.

1890
02:12:06,490 --> 02:12:06,670
Okay.

1891
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:08,510
I'll have a look around if you don't mind.

1892
02:12:08,690 --> 02:12:09,050
All right.

1893
02:12:09,550 --> 02:12:10,250
Go ahead.

1894
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:13,310
All right, let me try one more time and see if there's anything else.

1895
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:47,810
ask you a few more things concerning our talk well keep it short then what did i ask oh what exactly do you do here anyway i worked the forge for my masters isn't that obvious pipes weapons rocks keys a lot not right now of course since the maybe he'll like me and he'll make me weapons for the war you mean the war against the danes a key or something you know wars come and go My masters don't get involved.

1896
02:12:48,150 --> 02:12:49,610
They are a secretive lot.

1897
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:53,150
Okay, I think we talked to him here.

1898
02:12:53,490 --> 02:12:54,590
Okay, so let's leave.

1899
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:58,010
Okay, maybe now.

1900
02:13:00,690 --> 02:13:01,550
Maybe now.

1901
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:06,290
There's a bird's nest up on the chimney.

1902
02:13:07,650 --> 02:13:09,310
I'll never be able to reach it from here.

1903
02:13:09,510 --> 02:13:11,350
Well, how do I get it then?

1904
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:12,550
Actually.

1905
02:13:13,030 --> 02:13:13,230
Hmm.

1906
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:22,340
Oh, there was an arrow up.

1907
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:22,820
There was.

1908
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:25,240
Wait, there was.

1909
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:28,100
Can you climb so...

1910
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:29,480
Oh, you're right.

1911
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:30,200
Unless...

1912
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:31,900
Oh, I thought that went inside.

1913
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:33,220
Oh, you're right.

1914
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:36,080
We could talk to the bird.

1915
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:37,260
Well, are you quite comfortable?

1916
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:39,240
It's a bird.

1917
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:41,060
A crow, I think.

1918
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,920
Doop, doop, doop, doop, doop.

1919
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:56,800
okay we're he moves away and we destroy his nest and all of his life's work and all of his babies and everything

1922
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:52,480
which I vaguely remember.

1923
02:14:56,620 --> 02:14:58,640
I think it was, like, over here.

1924
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,140
Now we check every room.

1925
02:15:08,940 --> 02:15:10,400
It was that here.

1926
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:12,640
Maybe going the wrong way.

1927
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:13,940
I could be.

1928
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:18,820
Oh, this place is such a maze.

1929
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:21,380
Yeah, it was one of the Druid's rooms, yeah.

1930
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:24,420
But the fire was lit, and I do remember it.

1931
02:15:27,140 --> 02:15:28,580
I just don't remember where.

1932
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:29,800
I think that's...

1933
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:30,400
What's his name?

1934
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:31,620
Sussie's room.

1935
02:15:34,860 --> 02:15:35,900
Oh, oh, okay.

1936
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:37,040
So, sorry.

1937
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:37,540
Walk through.

1938
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:38,960
Explain to me again.

1939
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:42,900
Uh, use the iron bucket on the fire and place the candles in.

1940
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:43,600
Okay.

1941
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:44,940
I can do that.

1942
02:15:50,090 --> 02:15:51,310
You're not sorry for committing crimes.

1943
02:15:51,330 --> 02:15:51,330
Right.

1944
02:15:51,650 --> 02:15:53,050
Now the crucibles in the fireplace.

1945
02:15:55,010 --> 02:16:27,890
yes and then we melt our candlesticks oh it looks like boobs again the candles have melted now I've got a block of wax ominous wax I'm sorry guys I know that I'm like just going through the walkthrough, but

1946
02:16:31,410 --> 02:16:34,970
I have to go back to his office, but it wouldn't let me pixel hunt.

1947
02:16:36,850 --> 02:16:43,150
The guy, uh, Sissy, Sussy, Sissy, Sirsten, S-Sister?

1948
02:16:43,410 --> 02:16:45,410
Have you not been listening to me?

1949
02:16:45,610 --> 02:16:46,530
Get out!

1950
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:49,570
I'd like to watch you.

1951
02:16:50,090 --> 02:16:51,610
I'd like to stay and watch you.

1952
02:16:51,810 --> 02:16:52,530
I understand.

1953
02:16:53,530 --> 02:16:57,450
You wish to see for your what lies in store for you.

1954
02:16:57,530 --> 02:16:58,690
I can't get over his voice.

1955
02:16:59,050 --> 02:17:03,010
Many doomed men are fascinated by their executioners.

1956
02:17:04,130 --> 02:17:07,250
Man's curiosity is greater than his fear.

1957
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:11,950
Curiosity brought you here and curiosity will kill you.

1958
02:17:12,090 --> 02:17:12,910
Then you don't mind?

1959
02:17:13,110 --> 02:17:14,210
Ha ha ha ha.

1960
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:17,790
Be my guest if it abuses you.

1961
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:21,150
Watch me preparing for your final hour.

1962
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:22,210
I love this guy.

1963
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:27,810
As long as you do not touch any I can't even know you're here.

1964
02:17:28,270 --> 02:17:28,910
Thank you.

1965
02:17:28,930 --> 02:17:30,410
I appreciate it.

1966
02:17:33,090 --> 02:17:34,670
You appreciate it.

1967
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:37,630
You are a pathetic creature.

1968
02:17:38,010 --> 02:17:38,850
Ah, he called me.

1969
02:17:39,010 --> 02:17:40,490
He clocked me so fast.

1970
02:17:42,870 --> 02:17:44,170
Minto 24.

1971
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:48,590
Okay, so what is this?

1972
02:17:48,690 --> 02:17:50,090
I noticed this while he was talking.

1973
02:17:51,170 --> 02:17:54,370
This secret compartment is empty.

1974
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:54,970
Wait.

1975
02:17:55,010 --> 02:17:56,630
Oh, we do still have the amulet.

1976
02:17:57,290 --> 02:17:57,370
No.

1977
02:17:57,990 --> 02:17:58,130
What?

1978
02:17:59,250 --> 02:18:00,430
Is this the wax?

1979
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:01,990
A block of candle wax.

1980
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:03,470
Just got to stick that in there.

1981
02:18:13,350 --> 02:18:14,230
Oh, okay.

1982
02:18:15,310 --> 02:18:17,230
I use this wood in here.

1983
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:21,910
Oh, I can take it back out if I want to.

1984
02:18:22,050 --> 02:18:23,230
No, we put that in there.

1985
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:24,530
Interesting.

1986
02:18:25,130 --> 02:18:26,570
What's your paintings, mister?

1987
02:18:27,790 --> 02:18:29,090
This should remain here.

1988
02:18:29,410 --> 02:18:29,730
Wait!

1989
02:18:29,930 --> 02:18:32,970
This was in this was in their house too.

1990
02:18:33,470 --> 02:18:41,690
Wait, so was this one, but I don't recognize this one Might be the guy on the box Oh wait, no this one wait.

1991
02:18:41,810 --> 02:18:58,070
They kept all these images all these paintings Until modern time Wow That's crazy Okay, so apparently now we got to go talk to our favorite Malgam

1992
02:19:01,350 --> 02:19:02,770
Mark, that guy.

1993
02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:07,610
His room was, uh, this one?

1994
02:19:11,470 --> 02:19:12,530
Magmar, yeah.

1995
02:19:13,090 --> 02:19:15,210
Didn't I tell you not to speak to me?

1996
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:15,690
Sorry.

1997
02:19:16,410 --> 02:19:17,710
It'll only take a minute.

1998
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:19,010
It'll only take a moment.

1999
02:19:19,250 --> 02:19:19,750
What is it?

2000
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:22,410
Have you found the room that harbors the crystal ball?

2001
02:19:22,510 --> 02:19:23,070
Not yet.

2002
02:19:24,470 --> 02:19:25,590
I have found...

2003
02:19:25,590 --> 02:19:26,890
No, of course not.

2004
02:19:27,150 --> 02:19:28,870
If you don't know where it is, how should I?

2005
02:19:29,930 --> 02:20:02,670
find out until then do not put us in jeopardy no okay bye very well see you later well didn't i tell you not to speak to me okay we have to tell him about something oh ask him to get you undisturbed access to sirs sirsden i saw sirsden did you make a try yeah he said he will have us killed that's what oh by the way i also heard that it was actually your idea to have us executed on the day of the ritual.

2006
02:20:02,930 --> 02:20:04,390
Do not believe his lies.

2007
02:20:04,690 --> 02:20:06,130
I suggested nothing of the sword.

2008
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:08,250
Don't believe Sir Sten's lies.

2009
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:10,590
How do I know you're not in this with him?

2010
02:20:10,870 --> 02:20:12,790
There is no cause for you to doubt my words.

2011
02:20:12,890 --> 02:20:14,170
He could be one of the spies!

2012
02:20:14,910 --> 02:20:16,110
Who are the other conspirators?

2013
02:20:16,130 --> 02:20:17,530
Who are the other conspirators?

2014
02:20:17,870 --> 02:20:19,170
Won't you introduce me to them?

2015
02:20:19,290 --> 02:20:20,570
Are you out of your mind?

2016
02:20:20,790 --> 02:20:22,550
How can you speak so openly here?

2017
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:23,930
Do you want to betray us?

2018
02:20:24,390 --> 02:20:26,110
Sir Sten's spies are everywhere.

2019
02:20:26,230 --> 02:20:27,130
You are one of them!

2020
02:20:27,770 --> 02:20:27,850
Maybe.

2021
02:20:27,850 --> 02:20:28,970
I must leave at once.

2022
02:20:29,190 --> 02:20:29,910
They will have heard.

2023
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:30,170
us.

2024
02:20:30,550 --> 02:20:34,710
But I'm sure it will be a great help to me to know who's a friend around here and who isn't.

2025
02:20:35,070 --> 02:20:37,050
Just look upon everyone as your enemy.

2026
02:20:37,390 --> 02:20:38,570
That is the safest way.

2027
02:20:38,690 --> 02:20:40,870
I don't find that thought very comforting.

2028
02:20:41,190 --> 02:20:42,910
I will not betray my brothers to you.

2029
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:43,770
Why not?

2030
02:20:44,130 --> 02:20:47,430
If you fail, it will be better that you do not know their names.

2031
02:20:47,670 --> 02:20:49,090
Who says you're a friend anyway?

2032
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:49,650
Yeah, exactly.

2033
02:20:49,650 --> 02:20:51,830
I can do no more than give you my word.

2034
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:55,450
I don't know whether to believe you or not.

2035
02:20:55,550 --> 02:20:55,970
Be honest.

2036
02:20:56,530 --> 02:21:29,930
I don't know whether to believe lying to you who knows maybe you're just keeping me here so that i won't be alive in 1 000 years time so sinclair can just perform this ritual without anybody wait who will work at this at the police station you must make up your own mind whether or not to trust me if i'm not there do i have any choice in the matter none of us who will set the bush on fire okay we have to ask him to well see you later somehow get me access to his didn't i tell you not to speak to me Oh,

2037
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:31,610
here it is.

2038
02:21:31,750 --> 02:21:32,730
I need undisturbed access.

2039
02:21:32,970 --> 02:21:36,570
I need undisturbed access to one of the rooms in the monastery.

2040
02:21:36,990 --> 02:21:37,190
Hmm.

2041
02:21:37,870 --> 02:21:38,590
Which room?

2042
02:21:40,010 --> 02:21:42,070
Who will steal Lowry's scissors?

2043
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:44,670
Serstan's room.

2044
02:21:45,470 --> 02:21:46,090
Is that possible?

2045
02:21:46,350 --> 02:21:47,170
Out of the question.

2046
02:21:47,590 --> 02:21:51,970
Whenever Serstan leaves his room, he locks the door and never lets the key out of his sight.

2047
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:52,510
I see.

2048
02:21:56,350 --> 02:21:57,970
That settles that, then, doesn't it?

2049
02:21:58,290 --> 02:22:00,630
Or is there some way he could be lured away?

2050
02:22:01,390 --> 02:22:19,390
him out of his room on some pretext just long enough for me to take a look around undisturbed the way he like oh pretty please pretty please if i go on my tippy toes okay wait wait did he do it

2051
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:33,520
are we getting in there hold on i'm gonna save ringto 25.

2052
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:39,720
Is he gone?

2053
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:41,140
Maglore did it.

2054
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:43,580
Now I can take a good look around in peace.

2055
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:46,100
Oh, the fire is on his desk.

2056
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:47,600
Serston's writing desk.

2057
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:50,080
This is here again.

2058
02:22:53,030 --> 02:22:53,410
Ah!

2059
02:22:53,910 --> 02:22:54,430
What is this?

2060
02:22:54,510 --> 02:22:56,170
I don't feel I should be doing this.

2061
02:22:57,650 --> 02:22:58,650
I do.

2062
02:22:59,130 --> 02:23:02,010
If I push that stone in there, I'll never get it out again.

2063
02:23:02,750 --> 02:23:04,670
And I'll never get the casket back in.

2064
02:23:06,170 --> 02:23:10,490
Well, um, what do you want to do with it?

2065
02:23:13,710 --> 02:23:17,150
Wow, what a lovely view.

2066
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:19,370
I like the view.

2067
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:21,910
You're my best view.

2068
02:23:23,610 --> 02:23:25,790
This is a pretty jagged stretch of the coastline.

2069
02:23:27,830 --> 02:23:29,490
Maybe actually it would be good to have the brick.

2070
02:23:29,650 --> 02:23:30,730
We could throw it at his head.

2071
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:31,250
Oh.

2072
02:23:31,310 --> 02:23:33,510
He's bound to notice at once that the key's missing.

2073
02:23:33,850 --> 02:23:34,710
What the key?

2074
02:23:35,590 --> 02:23:36,730
How do I open this?

2075
02:23:37,970 --> 02:23:38,610
Oh, wait.

2076
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:39,310
Here?

2077
02:23:39,310 --> 02:24:19,280
It would have surprised me if it worked like that how do i open it where whoa he watched me gather worms maybe wow it's sparkling it's too far away could i throw it into here that doesn't work dang it can i i thought it would throw it into the hay and he would have noticed that it was in there because hay is for horses not for not for for little chests beautiful view bottom right

2078
02:24:23,150 --> 02:24:47,130
got any wax could we stick it in there now a block of candle wax wait what about this one wait I can't see any connection there you but it's a there's a key and a key with and with a thing that needs a key okay what Wait!

2079
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:47,850
What?

2080
02:24:48,910 --> 02:24:51,270
Could I not put it in here?

2081
02:24:51,470 --> 02:24:52,010
No way.

2082
02:24:52,750 --> 02:24:53,290
Why not?

2083
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:54,590
A block of candle wax.

2084
02:24:54,930 --> 02:24:55,630
That doesn't work.

2085
02:24:56,050 --> 02:24:57,530
Why is it in a no way?

2086
02:24:58,470 --> 02:25:01,030
We could get the imprint of the key, right?

2087
02:25:02,990 --> 02:25:04,730
Use the worms!

2088
02:25:06,170 --> 02:25:06,690
Wait!

2089
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:14,950
Take it out, get the...

2090
02:25:15,690 --> 02:25:17,410
Place it on the small table.

2091
02:25:17,550 --> 02:25:19,590
Oh, so I have to put it here to work on it.

2092
02:25:19,610 --> 02:25:20,750
Oh, okay, okay.

2093
02:25:21,930 --> 02:25:23,450
Now we can mess with it.

2094
02:25:23,630 --> 02:25:25,230
Aha, there's the key.

2095
02:25:25,490 --> 02:25:26,890
It's just open?

2096
02:25:27,890 --> 02:25:29,850
It'll be too dangerous to take them with me.

2097
02:25:30,630 --> 02:25:32,130
I couldn't make head or tail of them anyway.

2098
02:25:32,310 --> 02:25:32,670
Okay.

2099
02:25:32,710 --> 02:25:33,810
These are scrolls.

2100
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:36,790
Sirstan seems to be working on documents.

2101
02:25:37,350 --> 02:25:43,710
Okay, so now we can use the key and this.

2102
02:25:44,270 --> 02:25:45,390
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

2103
02:25:46,830 --> 02:25:48,430
Do I put it all back, though?

2104
02:25:48,470 --> 02:25:49,050
What about...

2105
02:25:49,610 --> 02:26:03,490
first now there's an imprint of the key in the wax block okay good now we put it back would have surprised me if it had worked like that we don't that's the key from sir stan's casket wait did we not put it back or

2106
02:26:08,250 --> 02:26:10,130
because he's gonna notice it's missing

2107
02:26:16,150 --> 02:26:30,510
huh but we need to put it back right that won't get me there's no point in that yeah i want to take this to the to the blacksmith, but I think we need to put it back, no?

2108
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:33,510
I can't.

2109
02:26:33,590 --> 02:26:34,550
Thank you so much for membership.

2110
02:26:34,890 --> 02:26:35,050
Thank you.

2111
02:26:35,050 --> 02:26:35,470
Oh my gosh.

2112
02:26:35,570 --> 02:26:36,250
Thank you for 20 gifts.

2113
02:26:36,410 --> 02:26:36,650
Thank you.

2114
02:26:36,890 --> 02:26:37,090
Thank you.

2115
02:26:37,930 --> 02:26:43,010
Oh, I gotta put it back on the stool and then put it back in and then put it back in.

2116
02:26:43,390 --> 02:26:43,390
Okay.

2117
02:26:44,090 --> 02:26:44,430
Gosh.

2118
02:26:44,650 --> 02:26:45,610
Order of operations.

2119
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:47,010
Order of operations, everybody.

2120
02:26:47,910 --> 02:26:48,070
Okay.

2121
02:26:48,750 --> 02:26:49,170
All right.

2122
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:52,230
There we go.

2123
02:26:53,010 --> 02:26:54,050
And then back in.

2124
02:26:54,070 --> 02:26:55,090
Into the hole it goes.

2125
02:26:58,490 --> 02:26:58,670
No?

2126
02:26:59,690 --> 02:27:00,330
Uh.

2127
02:27:02,850 --> 02:27:03,490
Uh.

2128
02:27:04,770 --> 02:27:04,910
Hmm?

2129
02:27:07,130 --> 02:27:07,510
But.

2130
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,580
Maybe it's pixel perfect?

2131
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:18,040
Did I miss something?

2132
02:27:21,300 --> 02:27:23,000
Oh, do I have to do it like this?

2133
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:24,600
Oh my gosh.

2134
02:27:26,300 --> 02:27:26,940
Oh.

2135
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:59,320
now we may leave somehow I don't think I put everything back as I found it no I think we did wait what do you mean what did I miss place what did I miss place maybe I have to take um the wood out I don't feel I should be doing this maybe I I need to do this.

2136
02:28:07,650 --> 02:28:09,530
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2137
02:28:10,170 --> 02:28:12,710
No evidence left at all.

2138
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:15,090
The perfect crime.

2139
02:28:17,250 --> 02:28:18,650
Alligan gets away with it again!

2140
02:28:21,710 --> 02:28:23,510
And then we gotta go outside.

2141
02:28:24,610 --> 02:28:26,130
Which, which, which way was that?

2142
02:28:28,070 --> 02:28:29,090
Which, which way?

2143
02:28:32,130 --> 02:28:35,030
Okay, now to...

2144
02:28:36,070 --> 02:28:36,950
The blacksmith.

2145
02:28:39,130 --> 02:28:40,650
She's a master of stealth.

2146
02:28:41,710 --> 02:28:42,250
Hello, sir.

2147
02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:43,930
Can you help me with this?

2148
02:28:46,870 --> 02:28:47,750
I need your help.

2149
02:28:48,370 --> 02:28:49,410
Could you take a look at this?

2150
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:56,160
That's the impression of a key.

2151
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:56,980
So what?

2152
02:28:57,320 --> 02:28:58,180
I've helped you.

2153
02:28:58,320 --> 02:28:59,780
Now I'm asking you to help me.

2154
02:29:00,580 --> 02:29:01,720
Make a key like this one.

2155
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:02,640
It'll take you two seconds.

2156
02:29:02,940 --> 02:29:02,980
What?

2157
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:03,480
Impossible.

2158
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:05,100
Sorry, stranger.

2159
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:05,840
Why not?

2160
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:07,340
I'll tell you.

2161
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:09,300
They'd kill us both.

2162
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:10,580
You owe me something.

2163
02:29:10,740 --> 02:29:11,060
Yeah, you owe me.

2164
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:13,320
If it hadn't been for me, they'd have punished you tomorrow anyway.

2165
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:14,860
You said so yourself.

2166
02:29:15,320 --> 02:29:17,020
Oh, God help me.

2167
02:29:18,060 --> 02:29:19,320
I must be going crazy.

2168
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:20,140
All right.

2169
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:22,680
Crazy in love for me, huh?

2170
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:23,180
I'll make you a key.

2171
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:24,520
It'll take a while, though.

2172
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:25,220
No problem.

2173
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:27,160
I'll come back later to pick it up.

2174
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:27,740
Yeah.

2175
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:29,620
Oh, there he goes.

2176
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:31,200
He's working on it.

2177
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:34,020
And I'm just shuffling along.

2178
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:36,350
I'm just shuffling around behind him.

2179
02:29:38,460 --> 02:29:40,140
Nice, nice, nice.

2180
02:29:43,820 --> 02:29:45,300
Go to the throne room.

2181
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:47,800
Look at the beads without touching them.

2182
02:29:48,640 --> 02:29:49,740
I touched them, though.

2183
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:53,540
Not sure how I feel about Halegan's historical crime spree.

2184
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:55,720
I have this.

2185
02:29:56,740 --> 02:30:03,200
This guy is probably causing all sorts of time paradoxes, but that's fine.

2186
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:13,770
was this the throne room whimsical music incoming

2187
02:30:22,630 --> 02:31:15,290
oh good god Brent you made me just say hello sorry you were so sorry you were so wrapped up in your books yes this one's really interesting yeah it's hard to make out though it deals with transformation rituals have you ever heard of a magical top no magical tops set objects in motion every druid carries one round she found the yaoi fanfic what's it good for it's a symbol of what of the earth's rotation and the cycle of the elements the druids believe that all natural phenomena are based on a transformation cycle fire transforms the elements the magical top is a symbol of this cycle the cycle of life you see sounds interesting yes i have to go on revealing.

2188
02:31:15,850 --> 02:31:20,210
I may even find a clue as to how Sirstan plans to perform his ritual.

2189
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:22,070
Could you leave me for a while, please?

2190
02:31:25,490 --> 02:31:26,050
Certainly.

2191
02:31:26,790 --> 02:31:27,110
Certainly.

2192
02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:28,270
I'll come back later.

2193
02:31:29,390 --> 02:31:32,930
The magical top is part of the circle of life, you guys.

2194
02:31:33,730 --> 02:31:35,270
And this very...

2195
02:31:38,670 --> 02:31:40,190
She's talking about Beyblades.

2196
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:42,050
Yeah, it's very revealing.

2197
02:31:42,050 --> 02:31:44,390
in this...

2198
02:31:44,390 --> 02:31:46,410

2199
02:31:47,930 --> 02:31:49,450

2200
02:31:54,390 --> 02:31:57,610
Go to the creepy dimly lit inner sanctum.

02:31:58,550 --> 02:32:00,610

2202

Alright, let's go to the creepy room, the creepy room.

02:33:13,780 --> 02:33:15,460
This way might be faster.

2218
02:33:16,980 --> 02:33:18,100

02:34:38,160 --> 02:34:38,620
uh-oh.

2227
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:40,040
The guide does not work.

2228
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:40,740
Oh, shoot.

2229
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:42,820
Guys, I already messed up.

2230
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:43,520
Okay, hold on.

2231
02:34:43,880 --> 02:34:44,620
We'll reload.

2232
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:47,920
We'll reload the game.

2233
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:51,260
Oh, no.

2234
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:52,320
Oh, no.

2235
02:34:52,540 --> 02:34:52,800
Okay.

2236
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:54,860
I learned my lesson.

2237
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:57,920
It's so fine.

2238
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:59,960
It's fine because we get to see this cutscene again.

2239
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:11,850
I can't believe that going back does not oh my gosh that does seem miserable okay we saved ourselves a headache for sure

2240
02:35:19,170 --> 02:35:22,010
oh okay the guide here

2241
02:35:25,630 --> 02:35:37,690
it is recommended you save here because if you get the order muddled up you can load fresh here all right go through the doorways in the correct order It is the right door.

2242
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:39,670
Unless they mean Halligan's right.

2243
02:35:39,970 --> 02:35:41,010
Probably not, right?

2244
02:35:51,740 --> 02:35:52,660
And then we go middle.

2245
02:35:59,670 --> 02:35:59,930
Okay.

2246
02:36:05,650 --> 02:36:07,850
And then we go furthest right.

2247
02:36:13,190 --> 02:36:15,810
Imagine if everyone agreed to not make a guide for this part.

2248
02:36:16,030 --> 02:36:16,390
Evil.

2249
02:36:17,010 --> 02:36:18,290
Then we go right again.

2250
02:36:20,350 --> 02:36:20,910
Okay.

2251
02:36:20,930 --> 02:36:22,030
Weeks of fun!

2252
02:36:22,330 --> 02:36:23,130
Weeks of fun!

2253
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:27,730
Okay, now we backtrack.

2254
02:36:30,910 --> 02:36:32,210
He should say, oh no.

2255
02:36:33,610 --> 02:36:37,190
Oh, oh, this looks like it might prove a little difficult.

2256
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:39,790
Furthest left.

2257
02:36:41,210 --> 02:36:42,090
Weeks of fun!

2258
02:36:42,370 --> 02:36:43,030
Weeks of fun!

2259
02:36:47,070 --> 02:36:47,670
Backtrack.

2260
02:36:50,230 --> 02:36:50,910
Oh, this is...

2261
02:36:50,930 --> 02:36:51,950
This is way too long.

2262
02:36:52,050 --> 02:36:52,550
I'm sorry.

2263
02:36:52,790 --> 02:36:53,410
What the hell?

2264
02:36:55,830 --> 02:36:56,830
Oh my god.

2265
02:36:58,130 --> 02:36:58,810
Okay, middle.

2266
02:37:06,910 --> 02:37:07,790
Furthest left.

2267
02:37:09,030 --> 02:37:10,270
This is so evil.

2268
02:37:10,570 --> 02:37:13,530
This is actually... This is so evil.

2269
02:37:14,690 --> 02:37:16,190
And then in the very end...

2270
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:17,170
What do you think, you guys?

2271
02:37:17,310 --> 02:37:18,130
What do you think we do?

2272
02:37:18,530 --> 02:37:19,730
You think you go left or right?

2273
02:37:20,130 --> 02:37:20,630
No, no.

2274
02:37:20,850 --> 02:37:22,350
You go... You backtrack.

2275
02:37:23,870 --> 02:37:25,550
What the actual hell?

2276
02:37:26,430 --> 02:37:30,000
We did it!

2277
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:32,200
Weeks of fun.

2278
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:37,340
Weeks of fun!

2279
02:37:37,560 --> 02:37:38,240
Weeks of fun!

2280
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:41,080
Weeks of fun!

2281
02:37:43,420 --> 02:37:44,860
Oh, you can...

2282
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:46,220
Okay, at the bottom of...

2283
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:46,540
Okay.

2284
02:37:47,540 --> 02:37:49,420
Let's just, uh...

2285
02:37:49,420 --> 02:37:49,900
Let's go.

2286
02:37:50,840 --> 02:37:52,560
Let's go explore ourselves.

2287
02:37:55,780 --> 02:37:56,100
Wow.

2288
02:37:57,060 --> 02:37:57,680
Wow.

2289
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:07,520
it was worth coming here I don't think he'd be so impressed

2290
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:35,100
a young tree a branch a sapling a fully grown tree an old tree I think this is an hourglass yes so the hourglass takes you to the past or the present or the future impressive yeah wait

2291
02:38:39,440 --> 02:38:47,460
it says close the doors behind you got to close the doors impressive oh here we go

2292
02:38:58,200 --> 02:39:00,960
oh it's freaky

2293
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:11,180
It's another maze!

2294
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:12,320
Imagine?

2295
02:39:17,980 --> 02:39:20,800
Sometimes just scampers around so much.

2296
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:23,340
Oh no.

2297
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:29,460
I'm taking a photo of this.

2298
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:35,440
Okay, I took a picture.

2299
02:39:36,300 --> 02:39:37,900
Get ready to par, God.

2300
02:39:39,880 --> 02:39:40,560
Okay.

2301
02:39:41,420 --> 02:39:44,700
So that's for the big tree.

2302
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:46,560
And the small tree.

2303
02:39:50,460 --> 02:39:51,400
Oh no!

2304
02:39:55,140 --> 02:39:56,260
It's all broke.

2305
02:39:58,180 --> 02:39:59,280
I took another picture.

2306
02:40:04,110 --> 02:40:05,530
But it might be messed up.

2307
02:40:06,450 --> 02:40:08,530
Well, they seem pretty in place still.

2308
02:40:09,190 --> 02:40:09,410
Maybe.

2309
02:40:10,710 --> 02:40:12,450
And now let's go ponder the orb.

2310
02:40:14,170 --> 02:40:16,870
One you need a photo of was the one you played with upstairs.

2311
02:40:18,650 --> 02:40:19,050
No?

2312
02:40:19,370 --> 02:40:20,090
Wait, really?

2313
02:40:20,870 --> 02:40:21,230
No?

2314
02:40:24,830 --> 02:40:26,630
That shouldn't be the case.

2315
02:40:29,820 --> 02:40:30,600
Okay.

2316
02:40:36,220 --> 02:40:37,480
I'm pondering the order.

2317
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:38,460
Wow.

2318
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:42,360
Stonehenge!

2319
02:40:43,540 --> 02:40:43,960
Wow.

2320
02:40:44,640 --> 02:40:45,860
That was Stonehenge.

2321
02:40:46,380 --> 02:40:47,420
Completely destroyed.

2322
02:40:47,740 --> 02:40:49,020
That was Stonehenge.

2323
02:40:50,460 --> 02:40:52,080
Yeah, how bizarre.

2324
02:40:53,720 --> 02:40:54,100
Okay.

2325
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:56,120
Hold on.

2326
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,180
Wait, what?

2327
02:41:06,320 --> 02:41:15,760
the guide is telling me the answer but I don't quite understand do I just solve this here oh

2328
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:45,180
I do wait oh my gosh wait so it's not this puzzle oh it's not this one that I needed to take a picture of it was the one upstairs that is the thing that I'm copying are you kidding me right now I had already messed it up.

2329
02:41:49,780 --> 02:41:50,720
Well, it's a good thing.

2330
02:41:51,580 --> 02:41:53,340
How was I supposed to know?

2331
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:56,320
How are you today, Vinto?

2332
02:41:56,780 --> 02:41:58,080
I'm great.

2333
02:41:58,740 --> 02:41:59,720
How are you?

2334
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:03,360
Thank you so much for the super chat.

2335
02:42:03,900 --> 02:42:05,220
How was I supposed to know?

2336
02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:08,280
I just started playing with the balls.

2337
02:42:09,580 --> 02:42:10,620
Oh, man.

2338
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:14,320
Wait, this should be it.

2339
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:19,760
Okay, this should be it.

2340
02:42:27,220 --> 02:42:29,900
And now...

2341
02:42:29,900 --> 02:42:31,700
Point and clicks be like those sometimes.

2342
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:33,560
Literally soft locked me in.

2343
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:40,640
The stick.

2344
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:42,820
What was that?

2345
02:42:42,980 --> 02:42:45,260
It's absolutely diabolical they let you play.

2346
02:42:46,500 --> 02:42:47,060
Why?

2347
02:42:47,880 --> 02:42:53,480
It's diabolical they let you play with the one upstairs because it should just be able to be left alone.

2348
02:42:59,020 --> 02:43:00,020
All right.

2349
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:07,400
Guys, I think we're nearing the end because we're on part four of the walkthrough.

2350
02:43:09,540 --> 02:43:10,160
Oh my gosh.

2351
02:43:10,280 --> 02:43:11,420
That's the final part.

2352
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:14,940
I think we're nearing the end.

2353
02:43:17,360 --> 02:43:18,900
It's already been almost three hours.

2354
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:19,740
I can't believe this.

2355
02:43:21,260 --> 02:43:22,660
I'm so into this game.

2356
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,900
We must go tell me.

2357
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:27,260
How do we get home?

2358
02:43:27,260 --> 02:43:27,940
How do we get home?

2359
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:38,330
Easy!

2360
02:43:38,670 --> 02:43:39,310
Okay, great.

2361
02:43:40,410 --> 02:43:41,780
And we're just gonna leave the doors open.

2362
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:53,100
I wonder actually how long this would take me without a walkthrough.

2363
02:43:53,400 --> 02:43:54,380
And without you guys helping.

2364
02:43:56,460 --> 02:43:57,120
Oh, he's not here.

2365
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:00,380
My co-workers came to work sick earlier this week.

2366
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:01,720
I've been feeling worse all day.

2367
02:44:02,280 --> 02:44:02,740
No!

2368
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:03,320
Road!

2369
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:05,240
I'm so sorry.

2370
02:44:05,620 --> 02:44:06,720
I'm so sorry.

2371
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:11,160
Aw, get well soon!

2372
02:44:16,770 --> 02:44:18,810
Oh, for many people using...

2373
02:44:18,810 --> 02:44:23,750
Oh, for people using this walkthrough out of order, this part starts immediately after have you looked into the crystal ball.

2374
02:44:24,250 --> 02:44:27,570
Okay, yeah, I have parts 1, 2, 3?

2375
02:44:29,310 --> 02:44:34,730
You may want to glance over parts 1, 2, and 3 and make sure you have the underlying items from those parts.

2376
02:44:35,050 --> 02:44:36,450
I sure hope so.

2377
02:44:38,750 --> 02:44:41,430
I don't think I can go back to parts 1 and 2.

2378
02:44:41,450 --> 02:45:42,130
I think we would be really really messed up then I think we're okay though go to my chamber okay Maglar's in here so we're not going on a wild goose chase looking in every room for this guy hello oh what maglo there you are I have been looking for you everywhere what a strut I figured it in the room where the crystal ball is hidden really is a calendar it works just like the one in the assembly chamber but with an additional day and night cycle and an hour schedule i entered the time of the ritual we figured that out how and sestan appeared in the crystal what what was he doing he was holding a staff decorated with runes which suddenly began to glow then he picked up a golden sickle a staff he used a bewitched staff to summon the power if we find that staff Yeah,

2379
02:45:42,390 --> 02:45:42,710
we do all of that.

2380
02:45:42,710 --> 02:45:43,590
Where could he be keeping it?

2381
02:45:43,810 --> 02:45:46,090
I've searched the whole monastery and found nothing.

2382
02:45:46,490 --> 02:45:46,910
The temples!

2383
02:45:47,430 --> 02:45:47,730
The temples!

2384
02:45:48,250 --> 02:45:48,590
The temples!

2385
02:45:48,630 --> 02:45:49,030
The temples!

2386
02:45:49,090 --> 02:45:49,830
How do we get there?

2387
02:45:50,450 --> 02:45:51,590
I haven't seen any exit.

2388
02:45:51,790 --> 02:45:56,750
The Christian monks built this monastery in such a way that it is only accessible through a secret tunnel.

2389
02:45:56,870 --> 02:45:57,550
Oh, that's how we got here.

2390
02:45:57,570 --> 02:46:00,930
Serston uses that to his advantage, as it allows him to control us.

2391
02:46:01,270 --> 02:46:06,010
Anyone wishing to leave the monastery is blindfolded and guided by Serston himself.

2392
02:46:06,710 --> 02:46:08,770
Nobody can leave here without Serston.

2393
02:46:08,950 --> 02:46:09,890
Where are they?

2394
02:46:09,990 --> 02:46:11,190
Bring them to me!

2395
02:46:11,450 --> 02:46:12,270
Did you hear that?

2396
02:46:12,590 --> 02:46:12,910
Hear what?

2397
02:46:13,250 --> 02:46:13,770
Out there.

2398
02:46:14,170 --> 02:46:15,690
I think I heard Serstan's voice.

2399
02:46:16,070 --> 02:46:17,170
He's looking for us.

2400
02:46:17,210 --> 02:46:17,850
Damn it.

2401
02:46:17,930 --> 02:46:18,910
That's all we need.

2402
02:46:19,370 --> 02:46:19,890
Lock the door.

2403
02:46:20,170 --> 02:46:21,830
And then let's get the hell out of here.

2404
02:46:24,290 --> 02:46:24,790
Okay.

2405
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:30,360
Uh...

2406
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:34,220
Maybe here?

2407
02:46:35,860 --> 02:46:36,460
Um...

2408
02:46:36,460 --> 02:46:36,920
Hmm.

2409
02:46:37,260 --> 02:46:38,160
Nothing's happening.

2410
02:46:38,440 --> 02:46:39,300
Yeah, no...

2411
02:46:39,300 --> 02:46:39,960
No kidding.

2412
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:41,180
Like, maybe...

2413
02:46:41,180 --> 02:46:41,700
What?

2414
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:44,840
I figured it'd be...

2415
02:46:44,860 --> 02:46:52,140
When we got this sheet, I was like, maybe it's so that we can, like, create a little rope to drop down, but I guess not.

2416
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:53,140
I don't want that.

2417
02:46:53,420 --> 02:46:54,020
Oh, we don't?

2418
02:46:54,160 --> 02:46:54,400
Okay.

2419
02:46:55,400 --> 02:46:56,960
Unless we do it like this.

2420
02:46:58,460 --> 02:46:58,900
No.

2421
02:47:01,220 --> 02:47:02,580
How do we get out of here?

2422
02:47:02,860 --> 02:47:03,980
How do we get out now?

2423
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:05,300
I don't know.

2424
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:06,940
Open up, traitors.

2425
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:09,280
The door won't hold him up for very long.

2426
02:47:10,500 --> 02:47:10,940
Okay.

2427
02:47:13,390 --> 02:47:14,790
Uh, hold on.

2428
02:47:15,710 --> 02:47:18,660
Hold on.

2429
02:47:18,840 --> 02:47:21,160
Take the sheet from the bed and use it on the candle.

2430
02:47:23,420 --> 02:47:24,480
What candle?

2431
02:47:25,940 --> 02:47:26,480
Oh, this?

2432
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:30,340
Are you...

2433
02:47:30,340 --> 02:47:30,700
Why?

2434
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:31,820
What?

2435
02:47:38,540 --> 02:47:38,940
Why?

2436
02:47:42,040 --> 02:47:44,440
Hi, Mint.

2437
02:47:44,540 --> 02:47:44,920
Hi.

2438
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:46,340
Huh?

2439
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:48,720
No?

2440
02:47:49,080 --> 02:47:49,360
No?

2441
02:47:49,360 --> 02:47:50,680
I should think up something else.

2442
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:51,900
Wait.

2443
02:47:52,480 --> 02:47:52,900
Huh?

2444
02:47:58,500 --> 02:48:00,100
Just wait and see.

2445
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:02,920
That...

2446
02:48:02,920 --> 02:48:04,100
It won't work like that.

2447
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,380
It's at the left window.

2448
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:08,480
But I don't.

2449
02:48:09,420 --> 02:48:11,500
Maybe it's my other left.

2450
02:48:12,740 --> 02:48:13,460
You know?

2451
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:16,480
Uh...

2452
02:48:19,350 --> 02:48:20,070
Uh...

2453
02:48:20,070 --> 02:48:20,970
Uh...

2454
02:48:22,230 --> 02:48:22,950
Yes.

2455
02:48:24,430 --> 02:48:29,090
Maybe it's a pixel perfect thing.

2456
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:40,220
Um, look out the window on the left and use the sheet on it.

2457
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:43,460
On what?

2458
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:45,320
I'd rather think about it again.

2459
02:48:47,260 --> 02:48:47,560
What?

2460
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:50,120
The chain?

2461
02:48:50,580 --> 02:48:51,780
It won't work like that.

2462
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:53,880
Now there's a hole in the sheet.

2463
02:48:55,640 --> 02:48:57,460
Why did you do that?

2464
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:01,760
Oh!

2465
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:02,400
Oh!

2466
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:04,100
Right, let's get out of here.

2467
02:49:05,180 --> 02:49:05,420
What?

2468
02:49:05,800 --> 02:49:07,360
Oh my gosh, it was pixel perfect.

2469
02:49:08,620 --> 02:49:09,140
Parachute?

2470
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:10,300
Parachute?

2471
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:12,440
Huh?

2472
02:49:13,300 --> 02:49:15,320
Wait, this will not hold to people.

2473
02:49:17,020 --> 02:49:17,340
What?

2474
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:18,060
Wait!

2475
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:21,600
We will fall to our death.

2476
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:23,320
Not with our parachute.

2477
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:24,980
We've got no alternative but to jump.

2478
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:25,880
Now hold on.

2479
02:49:31,280 --> 02:49:31,800
What?

2480
02:49:31,860 --> 02:49:32,040
What?

2481
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:37,120
Fireball!

2482
02:49:39,300 --> 02:49:40,740
Oh my gosh!

2483
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:41,520
What is it?

2484
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:42,840
It's homing!

2485
02:50:00,700 --> 02:50:02,960
Phew, that was close.

2486
02:50:03,140 --> 02:50:06,360
Um, are we not gonna talk about Maglord?

2487
02:50:10,850 --> 02:50:12,730
Oh, no, no, no, 28.

2488
02:50:15,170 --> 02:50:19,820
Are we just not gonna talk about...

2489
02:50:20,360 --> 02:50:22,460
of human shield, Maglore.

2490
02:50:24,480 --> 02:50:24,980
Let's go get him.

2491
02:50:25,100 --> 02:50:26,040
Let's go get our buddy.

2492
02:50:27,440 --> 02:50:28,340
Maglore, Maglore!

2493
02:50:28,940 --> 02:50:29,780
Where are you?

2494
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:31,500
Can you hear me?

2495
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:34,680
That was close for me.

2496
02:50:36,060 --> 02:50:37,020
Wait, there he is.

2497
02:50:37,280 --> 02:50:38,640
Maglore, are you hurt?

2498
02:50:40,920 --> 02:50:42,040
Are you hurt?

2499
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:43,640
That's the first thing you ask?

2500
02:50:43,900 --> 02:50:45,660
He hit me in the back.

2501
02:50:45,980 --> 02:50:49,080
You are on your own.

2502
02:50:49,640 --> 02:50:50,020
Now.

2503
02:50:50,860 --> 02:51:22,620

2504
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:23,520
Okay, okay.

2505
02:51:23,560 --> 02:51:24,060
Why doesn't he know?

2506
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:24,580
Don't give up.

2507
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:25,540
I'll be back in a second.

2508
02:51:25,560 --> 02:51:26,920
How does he know I'll recognize it?

2509
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:29,240
Okay, don't give up.

2510
02:51:29,540 --> 02:51:30,080
Don't give up.

2511
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:32,440
We're going to get the mistletoe for you.

2512
02:51:34,760 --> 02:51:35,360
Is this it?

2513
02:51:35,380 --> 02:51:37,040
I won't touch them with my bare hands.

2514
02:51:37,240 --> 02:51:38,100
I still have gloves.

2515
02:51:39,100 --> 02:51:40,900
What if we give him poison ivy instead?

2516
02:51:46,430 --> 02:51:47,530
What about Melanie?

2517
02:51:47,750 --> 02:51:47,910
Oh!

2518
02:51:51,190 --> 02:51:52,370
What about Melanie?

2519
02:51:54,550 --> 02:51:54,990
Oh!

2520
02:51:55,010 --> 02:51:55,590
Don't give up.

2521
02:51:55,890 --> 02:51:56,890
I'll be back in a second.

2522
02:51:57,690 --> 02:51:58,230
I got you!

2523
02:51:58,310 --> 02:51:59,030
Your mistletoe!

2524
02:52:01,270 --> 02:52:02,870
The healing mistletoe.

2525
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:05,070
The healing mistletoe.

2526
02:52:06,530 --> 02:52:07,010
Uh...

2527
02:52:07,010 --> 02:52:08,310
It's pixel perfect.

2528
02:52:08,590 --> 02:52:09,270
I had it there, just.

2529
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:10,190
I've got the mistletoe.

2530
02:52:10,610 --> 02:52:11,730
What do I have to do now?

2531
02:52:11,930 --> 02:52:12,270
Maglore?

2532
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:13,090
Maglore!

2533
02:52:13,350 --> 02:52:13,910
Damn it!

2534
02:52:16,770 --> 02:52:17,250
Uh...

2535
02:52:18,130 --> 02:52:18,610
Uh...

2536
02:52:19,090 --> 02:52:19,570
Maglore!

2537
02:52:21,670 --> 02:52:22,150
Maglore!

2538
02:52:22,730 --> 02:52:23,210
Uh...

2539
02:52:26,110 --> 02:52:27,150
Do you...

2540
02:52:27,150 --> 02:52:28,470
You need mistletoe?

2541
02:52:28,530 --> 02:52:30,030
How is that right above us?

2542
02:52:30,450 --> 02:52:31,170
Wait, is he dead?

2543
02:52:33,210 --> 02:52:33,590
Oh.

2544
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:35,490
Oh.

2545
02:52:40,620 --> 02:52:42,620
Oh, am I taking...

2546
02:52:42,620 --> 02:52:44,260
You won't recognize it.

2547
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:46,760
I took a...

2548
02:52:46,760 --> 02:52:48,580
I took the power top!

2549
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:49,580
Wait, what was it called?

2550
02:52:49,740 --> 02:52:50,380
That's a top.

2551
02:53:02,500 --> 02:53:03,020
It's

2552
02:53:07,360 --> 02:53:08,720
a magical top.

2553
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:09,300
We got it.

2554
02:53:09,320 --> 02:53:09,940
We got it.

2555
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:15,260
Okay, sorry, I know I'm safe scubbing a little bit, but I don't want to...

2556
02:53:15,260 --> 02:53:17,340
I thought I was pretty fast with that mistletoe.

2557
02:53:17,500 --> 02:53:18,220
I'm not gonna lie.

2558
02:53:20,780 --> 02:53:22,720
It's fast with getting that, I think.

2559
02:53:23,700 --> 02:53:24,580
What is this, anyway?

2560
02:53:26,140 --> 02:53:27,600
Okay, no description.

2561
02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:30,460
Who are we...

2562
02:53:30,460 --> 02:53:35,040
Wait, do we keep the mistletoe for, like, kissing Melanie later, you think?

2563
02:53:36,340 --> 02:53:39,120
You think that's what we're gonna do with her?

2564
02:53:41,400 --> 02:53:42,460
You think so?

2565
02:53:44,380 --> 02:53:45,600
Be like it, Melanie.

2566
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:48,260
Merry Christmas.

2567
02:53:53,410 --> 02:53:56,310
Whoa, why is there a staircase behind here?

2568
02:53:56,950 --> 02:53:57,950
I can't open this.

2569
02:53:58,430 --> 02:53:59,070
Open what?

2570
02:53:59,430 --> 02:54:01,790
I can see strange rooms behind these walls.

2571
02:54:02,270 --> 02:54:02,950
Yeah, cool.

2572
02:54:04,210 --> 02:54:05,030
The nail!

2573
02:54:06,090 --> 02:54:07,790
Finally, we can scratch it!

2574
02:54:12,180 --> 02:54:14,000
Whoa, he actually has nothing to say.

2575
02:54:14,260 --> 02:54:15,300
A strange table.

2576
02:54:27,670 --> 02:54:29,830
It scratches from the top.

2577
02:54:35,840 --> 02:54:38,430
I am the magical top.

2578
02:54:38,890 --> 02:54:41,590
Bayblade let her rip.

2579
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:47,400
Whoa.

2580
02:54:48,320 --> 02:54:50,600
So Melanie, before asking her to pay the tab.

2581
02:54:52,340 --> 02:54:52,960
Take that.

2582
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:54,240
Take that.

2583
02:54:54,480 --> 02:54:55,240
Okay, just kidding.

2584
02:54:56,680 --> 02:54:57,360
Okay.

2585
02:55:00,440 --> 02:55:01,000
Whoa!

2586
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:07,100
Um, I don't think this room was worth it.

2587
02:55:07,200 --> 02:55:08,400
Oh, oops.

2588
02:55:13,490 --> 02:55:14,190
What is this?

2589
02:55:15,330 --> 02:55:17,270
Ah, they look like switches.

2590
02:55:20,610 --> 02:55:22,790
Nope, it doesn't work anymore.

2591
02:55:24,730 --> 02:55:26,410
Nope, it doesn't work anymore.

2592
02:55:27,390 --> 02:55:29,730
Am I trying to get them all in?

2593
02:55:30,690 --> 02:55:31,170
Nope.

2594
02:55:31,170 --> 02:55:32,650
This switch is broken.

2595
02:55:34,050 --> 02:55:34,310
Nope.

2596
02:55:34,790 --> 02:55:35,830
It doesn't work anymore.

2597
02:55:36,130 --> 02:55:36,730
Oh, it's...

2598
02:55:36,730 --> 02:55:36,850
Wait.

2599
02:55:39,190 --> 02:55:39,750
Okay.

2600
02:55:43,290 --> 02:55:43,830
I...

2601
02:55:43,830 --> 02:55:45,330
But is it supposed to be all...

2602
02:55:46,070 --> 02:55:46,630
All...

2603
02:55:46,630 --> 02:55:48,170
In or all...

2604
02:55:48,730 --> 02:55:49,210
Ow!

2605
02:55:49,890 --> 02:55:51,870
Maybe it's supposed to be like alternating.

2606
02:55:52,830 --> 02:55:53,550
Wait, that one...

2607
02:55:53,550 --> 02:55:56,070
Oh, because it'll be up and up in.

2608
02:55:56,170 --> 02:55:56,330
Oh.

2609
02:55:58,130 --> 02:55:58,410
Nope.

2610
02:55:59,070 --> 02:55:59,910
It doesn't work anymore.

2611
02:56:09,330 --> 02:56:16,370
nope it doesn't work nope it doesn't work anymore he pisses me off oh

2612
02:56:33,100 --> 02:56:51,280
it just says click the middle one and then go back in okay so this also switches things around interesting oh what is this what is that that's a flint oh and steel

2613
02:56:57,240 --> 02:56:58,460
Flint and steel.

2614
02:57:04,310 --> 02:57:05,430
Chicken Jackie.

2615
02:57:06,050 --> 02:57:06,250
Soup!

2616
02:57:07,750 --> 02:57:09,070
Okay, I got a ladle.

2617
02:57:09,310 --> 02:57:09,590
A ladle.

2618
02:57:09,990 --> 02:57:10,210
Yeah.

2619
02:57:11,150 --> 02:57:11,670
Alright.

2620
02:57:14,250 --> 02:57:16,050
Enter the spinning chamber again and again.

2621
02:57:17,570 --> 02:57:19,010
Go up the stairs and get this shovel.

2622
02:57:19,110 --> 02:57:21,870
Okay, we gotta keep going around and around, baby.

2623
02:57:30,300 --> 02:57:31,420
Nothing here.

2624
02:57:34,440 --> 02:57:35,820
Oh, what is this?

2625
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:37,640
A bagpipe?

2626
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:38,740
I can't take it.

2627
02:57:38,940 --> 02:57:41,700
There seems to be some kind of invisible barrier over the bowl.

2628
02:57:42,020 --> 02:57:43,700
Oh my gosh!

2629
02:57:43,820 --> 02:57:44,760
Well, what's up here?

2630
02:57:45,360 --> 02:57:46,740
Oh, this is the air!

2631
02:57:47,440 --> 02:57:47,760
Okay.

2632
02:57:49,800 --> 02:57:50,280
Alright.

2633
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:51,840
Maybe I can take it now.

2634
02:57:55,240 --> 02:57:56,300
I can't take it.

2635
02:57:56,900 --> 02:57:57,380
Okay.

2636
02:58:01,540 --> 02:58:02,500
And then...

2637
02:58:02,500 --> 02:58:04,800
Hold on, I'm just glancing at the...

2638
02:58:12,340 --> 02:58:16,840
Okay, we just got to keep getting the little altar items.

2639
02:58:19,980 --> 02:58:20,980
I'm getting dizzy.

2640
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:23,080
Wait, is this my top still here?

2641
02:58:23,580 --> 02:58:24,540
Okay, I'll take it still.

2642
02:58:26,540 --> 02:58:28,780
Uh, we gotta get...

2643
02:58:28,780 --> 02:58:30,680
We gotta keep going through, I guess.

2644
02:58:34,360 --> 02:58:35,160
What is this one?

2645
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:36,020
Oh, this is the water.

2646
02:58:36,300 --> 02:58:38,300
For some reason I'm not able to get at it.

2647
02:58:38,360 --> 02:58:40,560
There seems to be some kind of invisible barrier.

2648
02:58:40,600 --> 02:58:51,600
over the bowl okay we just got to keep going in circles this is really bizarre what this game bizarre that's a flint oh we got another flint

Okay, this is fire.

2652
02:59:56,220 --> 02:59:56,220
Nothing.

2653
02:59:56,640 --> 02:59:57,400
Okay, keep going.

2654
02:59:57,560 --> 02:59:58,080
Keep going.

2655
02:59:58,260 --> 02:59:58,940
Keep going.

2656
02:59:59,900 --> 03:00:00,920
We grab air.

2657
03:00:02,380 --> 03:00:02,400
Wait.

2658
03:00:04,280 --> 03:00:05,420
We grab the air.

2659
03:00:12,020 --> 03:00:12,640
Nice.

2660
03:00:16,820 --> 03:00:17,700
And then back.

2661
03:00:18,800 --> 03:00:21,360
And then we get the water.

2662
03:00:23,100 --> 03:00:25,540
Oh my gosh, I'm going to have to go all the way through this again.

2663
03:00:26,500 --> 03:00:28,080
Oh my gosh, okay.

2664
03:00:28,780 --> 03:00:29,360
The water.

2665
03:00:29,480 --> 03:00:30,700
Oh, I did that again.

2666
03:00:32,800 --> 03:00:36,820
And bring back the ancient air to present times.

2667
03:00:39,820 --> 03:00:40,380
Okay.

2668
03:00:42,760 --> 03:00:43,320
Okay.

2669
03:00:47,280 --> 03:00:48,980
Use the shovel on the soil.

2670
03:00:49,180 --> 03:00:50,640
Enter the...

2671
03:00:50,640 --> 03:00:51,560
Use the...

2672
03:00:53,020 --> 03:00:53,580
Okay.

2673
03:00:54,660 --> 03:00:56,660
Now we can...

2674
03:00:58,980 --> 03:01:00,620
Go back to the chamber.

2675
03:01:01,900 --> 03:01:03,140
Should be able to exit.

2676
03:01:04,120 --> 03:01:05,740
Hopefully we can exit soon.

2677
03:01:08,620 --> 03:01:09,960
Oh my gosh.

2678
03:01:12,800 --> 03:01:14,320
What the?

2679
03:01:14,620 --> 03:01:16,160
Oh, I didn't press that.

2680
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:18,300
Okay.

2681
03:01:22,980 --> 03:01:23,740
Okay.

2682
03:01:27,860 --> 03:01:28,340
Okay.

2683
03:01:33,970 --> 03:01:34,930
Oh my god.

2684
03:01:35,190 --> 03:01:35,930
When does it end?

2685
03:01:37,430 --> 03:01:38,650
When does it end?

2686
03:01:40,010 --> 03:01:42,310
Let me out of this hellhole!

2687
03:01:44,250 --> 03:01:45,250
Oh, we're out!

2688
03:01:45,390 --> 03:01:46,450
Okay, we can leave now.

2689
03:01:47,750 --> 03:01:48,430
Oh, thank goodness.

2690
03:01:48,990 --> 03:01:50,130
No, no, okay, good, good.

2691
03:01:50,510 --> 03:01:50,750
All right.

2692
03:01:51,130 --> 03:01:52,510
First of all, hold on.

2693
03:01:52,850 --> 03:01:53,510
We save.

2694
03:01:55,750 --> 03:01:56,710
Mito 29.

2695
03:01:57,090 --> 03:01:59,070
I'm about to hit the big three-oh.

2696
03:02:00,590 --> 03:02:05,150
I hope this game reveals the mystery of why the druids bothered with all this complicated nonsense.

2697
03:02:05,750 --> 03:02:07,730
It's because only they would understand.

2698
03:02:08,290 --> 03:02:08,790
Wait, what is this?

2699
03:02:08,870 --> 03:02:09,170
As a megalith.

2700
03:02:09,530 --> 03:02:10,410
A megalith.

2701
03:02:11,190 --> 03:02:14,470
Only they would understand, and then...

2702
03:02:14,470 --> 03:02:17,370
No one else would be able to do their rituals.

2703
03:02:17,650 --> 03:02:18,510
Except me.

2704
03:02:21,450 --> 03:02:23,970
Brent Halligan from the Scotland Yard.

2705
03:02:27,570 --> 03:02:28,110
Oh.

2706
03:02:34,110 --> 03:02:36,490
I think we're gonna do some mixing in there.

2707
03:02:37,570 --> 03:02:38,050
Not yet.

2708
03:02:42,570 --> 03:02:43,110
Oh.

2709
03:02:43,770 --> 03:02:44,810
Where did I come from?

2710
03:02:45,710 --> 03:02:45,850
Oh.

2711
03:02:49,640 --> 03:02:50,340
A key.

2712
03:02:51,020 --> 03:02:51,780
Can I get this key?

2713
03:02:51,900 --> 03:02:52,720
It looks like it's guarded.

2714
03:02:53,400 --> 03:02:53,460
Oh.

2715
03:02:53,900 --> 03:02:54,820
I can't.

2716
03:02:54,940 --> 03:02:57,740
I don't know why, but I can't take anything from the altar.

2717
03:02:58,080 --> 03:02:58,620
Okay.

2718
03:03:05,900 --> 03:03:07,180
How do we know?

2719
03:03:07,340 --> 03:03:52,140

2721
03:04:49,870 --> 03:04:51,410
Why suddenly do I hear France?

2722
03:04:54,030 --> 03:04:54,790
Wait, what?

2723
03:04:55,430 --> 03:04:56,670
Did you guys hear that?

2724
03:05:07,080 --> 03:05:09,820
Why did I hear, why did I hear France all of a sudden?

2725
03:05:10,220 --> 03:05:11,100
Oh, this is earth.

2726
03:05:11,240 --> 03:05:14,160
Okay, we put the, we put the dirt in here.

2727
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:15,280
Weep.

2728
03:05:15,300 --> 03:05:16,060
Weep, weep, weep.

2729
03:05:17,800 --> 03:05:18,520
Weep, weep.

2730
03:05:19,100 --> 03:05:21,820
It really looks like pot, like poo poo.

2731
03:05:22,180 --> 03:05:23,400
It's like it looks.

2732
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:26,080
Do I...

2733
03:05:26,080 --> 03:05:27,520
I'd rather think about it again.

2734
03:05:27,740 --> 03:05:29,360
Okay, we just shut it, and it's fine.

2735
03:05:31,360 --> 03:05:32,680
Was that all I needed to do?

2736
03:05:32,760 --> 03:05:34,160
Hold on, I'm gonna double check.

2737
03:05:35,320 --> 03:05:36,720
Dirt in quotations.

2738
03:05:42,090 --> 03:05:45,150
Use the torch to open the grate underneath the orb.

2739
03:05:46,650 --> 03:05:47,610
What torch?

2740
03:05:49,130 --> 03:05:49,570
Weep.

2741
03:05:50,310 --> 03:05:50,730
Weep.

2742
03:05:50,990 --> 03:05:50,990
Weep.

2743
03:05:51,810 --> 03:05:52,770
What torch?

2744
03:05:57,500 --> 03:05:58,540
I hear...

2745
03:06:01,660 --> 03:06:02,680
Uh, hold on.

2746
03:06:06,300 --> 03:06:10,260
Oh, and use the light to...

2747
03:06:10,260 --> 03:06:10,920
Okay, okay.

2748
03:06:11,040 --> 03:06:18,860
I did see that there was a torch in the previous room that was not lit up, and we're supposed to do that.

2749
03:06:19,240 --> 03:06:22,440
We're supposed to use the fire to light it up.

2750
03:06:22,540 --> 03:06:23,520
Okay, perfect.

2751
03:06:27,980 --> 03:06:31,540
Did we really have weeks of fun just to rip off the end of...

2752
03:06:32,260 --> 03:06:33,580
Don't say that!

2753
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:37,180
I noticed this guy up here.

2754
03:06:37,340 --> 03:06:37,580
Aha!

2755
03:06:38,120 --> 03:06:38,460
Okay.

2756
03:06:42,380 --> 03:06:47,140
Nothing is ever not a coincidence in this game, I suppose.

2757
03:06:49,540 --> 03:06:51,100
What other music will play?

2758
03:06:51,720 --> 03:06:53,120
And the other ones, I wonder.

2759
03:06:54,240 --> 03:06:54,400
Bing.

2760
03:06:55,160 --> 03:06:56,040
Bing, Bing, Bing.

2761
03:06:57,420 --> 03:06:58,040
Bing, Bing, Bing.

2762
03:06:59,560 --> 03:07:00,880
Was this the Earth?

2763
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:02,640
Yes.

2764
03:07:08,760 --> 03:07:10,500
We're performing the ritual.

2765
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:14,180
We're cooking the poo.

2766
03:07:19,500 --> 03:07:19,820
Okay.

2767
03:07:20,720 --> 03:07:21,220
Very nice.

2768
03:07:21,960 --> 03:07:22,620
To the next one.

2769
03:07:28,060 --> 03:07:31,440
I don't know why these doors exist if I can't just go in them.

2770
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:35,740
Okay, this is...

2771
03:07:43,820 --> 03:07:45,420
This gotta be water, right?

2772
03:07:46,520 --> 03:07:49,820
The other one, and then the other one, the wispy one is the wind.

2773
03:07:51,300 --> 03:07:51,760
Aha!

2774
03:07:55,100 --> 03:07:56,100
That's not a lie.

2775
03:07:56,240 --> 03:07:58,260
I think maybe we should have gotten two ladles full.

2776
03:08:00,400 --> 03:08:01,700
The magic soup.

2777
03:08:02,300 --> 03:08:03,460
This is our love potion.

2778
03:08:13,510 --> 03:08:13,970
Okay!

2779
03:08:16,910 --> 03:08:17,370
Hooray!

2780
03:08:23,710 --> 03:08:24,610
Over here.

2781
03:08:25,810 --> 03:08:27,250
Over here.

2782
03:08:29,310 --> 03:08:30,750
In here.

2783
03:08:31,770 --> 03:08:31,950
Yep.

2784
03:08:33,510 --> 03:08:34,530
We're just pump.

2785
03:08:34,790 --> 03:08:36,350
We're just going to put some air in there.

2786
03:08:41,610 --> 03:08:44,070
I hope it doesn't get out.

2787
03:08:45,590 --> 03:08:48,370
This is how magic air works, you guys.

2788
03:08:50,010 --> 03:08:52,230
Mouth to mouth.

2789
03:08:56,880 --> 03:08:57,600
Yippee!

2790
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:02,100
Good thing it doesn't escape.

2791
03:09:02,720 --> 03:09:04,280
Yeah, good thing.

2792
03:09:05,160 --> 03:09:05,960
Goodness gracious.

2793
03:09:07,240 --> 03:09:10,340
Wait, we didn't get any other music for the video.

2794
03:09:25,950 --> 03:09:26,210
Hey.

2795
03:09:26,850 --> 03:09:28,790
Alright, I like that we just leave the door.

2796
03:09:29,970 --> 03:09:31,250
The door open.

2797
03:09:31,970 --> 03:09:34,050
They could be like, where does he, where could he be at?

2798
03:09:44,440 --> 03:09:45,360
Bum, bum, bum.

2799
03:09:46,540 --> 03:09:48,800
Okay, sorry, I'm saving again because I don't want to do...

2800
03:09:48,800 --> 03:09:51,280
I don't want to, like, repeat processes, you know what I mean?

2801
03:09:51,520 --> 03:09:52,400
Here we go!

2802
03:09:52,660 --> 03:09:54,580
Into the layer.

2803
03:09:55,220 --> 03:09:56,440
Is this where the babies are?

2804
03:09:58,120 --> 03:09:59,220
Oh my god.

2805
03:10:01,660 --> 03:10:03,640
He's in a big rush now.

2806
03:10:04,500 --> 03:10:05,280
He's like, pizza!

2807
03:10:05,760 --> 03:10:06,500
Pizza, pizza!

2808
03:10:07,320 --> 03:10:09,140
I gotta go on my pizza date!

2809
03:10:10,960 --> 03:10:13,180
Oh shoot, there's things I should be looking at.

2810
03:10:16,790 --> 03:10:17,890
A stone plate.

2811
03:10:18,250 --> 03:10:19,170
There's a symbol on it.

2812
03:10:19,290 --> 03:10:21,890
So you carried a ladle full of water in your pocket?

2813
03:10:23,850 --> 03:10:24,690
Okay, hold on.

2814
03:10:24,810 --> 03:10:25,990
I gotta go back up the stairs.

2815
03:10:26,790 --> 03:10:28,230
I wasn't paying attention.

2816
03:10:28,430 --> 03:10:28,810
No, no.

2817
03:10:30,790 --> 03:10:31,270
Okay.

2818
03:10:33,230 --> 03:10:34,950
I was so excited for pizza.

2819
03:10:36,670 --> 03:10:37,750
That was Earth.

2820
03:10:41,250 --> 03:10:42,890
I need some water soon.

2821
03:10:44,930 --> 03:10:45,970
Oh, maybe there's... Okay.

2822
03:10:46,810 --> 03:10:47,670
Those were the first two.

2823
03:10:48,330 --> 03:10:50,230
Okay, so Earth Fire.

2824
03:10:52,450 --> 03:10:56,070
I don't know if we have to remember the order for this but it was earth fire

2825
03:11:00,030 --> 03:11:15,590
hmm I am captain planet captain planet he's a hero gonna take pollution down to zero more

2826
03:11:20,510 --> 03:11:32,210
fire wait uh oh wait what what was the what was the one I just grabbed oh a stone plate there's a symbol on it can I put these back let me check that too okay I can not.

2827
03:11:32,350 --> 03:11:33,270
I can only take them.

2828
03:11:50,610 --> 03:11:53,010
I, yeah, I can only takeeth, I may not giveeth.

2829
03:11:54,170 --> 03:11:57,690
Are we going to be conducting like science down here?

2830
03:11:59,490 --> 03:12:00,790
Equations, perhaps?

2831
03:12:01,910 --> 03:12:03,470
I don't want to do equations.

2832
03:12:18,040 --> 03:12:19,440
Oh, wow, we do!

2833
03:12:19,660 --> 03:12:20,940
We have to do equations!

2834
03:12:27,730 --> 03:12:28,790
Did I miss some?

2835
03:12:29,430 --> 03:12:29,870
Heck.

2836
03:12:34,060 --> 03:12:36,420
Oh, sorry, my big head's blocking it, but it's the stick.

2837
03:12:36,620 --> 03:12:37,160
It won't work.

2838
03:12:37,540 --> 03:12:42,580
Something is preventing me from taking the staff okay

2839
03:12:47,310 --> 03:12:52,370
there has to be a way of knowing what i'm combining though right

2840
03:12:56,650 --> 03:12:58,290
like what's the clue

2841
03:13:03,920 --> 03:13:05,960
walkthrough so true

2842
03:13:14,270 --> 03:13:28,970
okay basically the walkthrough is just like okay we need to get eight plates one two three i have six i missed two plates we gotta go back It doesn't matter which one we do first, I gotta go back.

2843
03:13:29,670 --> 03:13:30,330
Is it over here?

2844
03:13:32,450 --> 03:13:34,030
Uh, other side?

2845
03:13:35,410 --> 03:13:36,810
Maid, mint, phantom.

2846
03:13:37,110 --> 03:13:37,490
That's me!

2847
03:13:40,750 --> 03:13:43,070
I'm mint phantom and I'm a maid.

2848
03:13:43,910 --> 03:13:44,570
Where were they?

2849
03:13:46,630 --> 03:13:47,830
Am I blind?

2850
03:13:51,750 --> 03:13:53,070
We need two more.

2851
03:13:53,530 --> 03:13:56,510
Where are they?

2852
03:13:58,470 --> 03:13:59,710
Top two?

2853
03:14:05,680 --> 03:14:05,780
Hmm?

2854
03:14:06,620 --> 03:14:07,440
Near the...

2855
03:14:09,220 --> 03:14:10,540
Near the top?

2856
03:14:11,160 --> 03:14:13,020
Of the whole staircase?

2857
03:14:16,610 --> 03:14:17,110
Oh, wait.

2858
03:14:18,010 --> 03:14:18,010
Wait.

2859
03:14:21,510 --> 03:14:22,750
Oh, I didn't see this one.

2860
03:14:24,750 --> 03:14:25,330
Obviously.

2861
03:14:27,330 --> 03:14:27,850
Ah!

2862
03:14:29,710 --> 03:14:31,510
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2863
03:14:34,910 --> 03:14:35,710
Thank you, guys.

2864
03:14:39,210 --> 03:14:41,390
Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza!

2865
03:14:43,330 --> 03:14:45,010
You think he's in the pits?

2866
03:14:45,230 --> 03:14:45,570
Armpits?

2867
03:14:48,150 --> 03:14:49,390
Sneaky, sneaky!

2868
03:14:49,810 --> 03:14:50,890
Ah, they were so sneaky.

2869
03:14:53,250 --> 03:14:53,870
Alright.

2870
03:14:55,490 --> 03:14:56,050
Alright.

2871
03:14:56,790 --> 03:14:57,010
Alright.

2872
03:14:57,310 --> 03:14:59,230
The guide basically is like...

2873
03:14:59,230 --> 03:15:01,770
The guide says I'm not explaining this puzzle.

2874
03:15:02,870 --> 03:15:05,050
Because the orientation is hard to grasp.

2875
03:15:05,390 --> 03:15:06,330
Here's some pictures.

2876
03:15:09,870 --> 03:15:11,450
So first we go into here.

2877
03:15:17,880 --> 03:15:18,860
Oh, what a thrill.

2878
03:15:19,380 --> 03:15:20,320
Ancient staircase addition.

2879
03:15:25,180 --> 03:15:27,280
Showing you the angle and the plates to use.

2880
03:15:27,560 --> 03:15:31,060
So this is the earth on the top.

2881
03:15:32,600 --> 03:15:35,100
I'm guessing this is what he means by top slot.

2882
03:15:35,900 --> 03:15:41,380
So earth and air.

2883
03:15:44,420 --> 03:15:53,200
how am i supposed to know this just trial and error like how the hell

2884
03:16:01,770 --> 03:16:48,530
oh sorry sorry you guys are so right i did okay what confused me okay you're right this is this is water yes thank you guys thank you so much what got me was um they drew like the zigzags the guide and that's i was like oh zigzaggies okay weeks weeks of fun okay next room is uh maybe this one and this is water on the top and air on the bottom.

2885
03:16:51,270 --> 03:16:52,610
What's the speed run for?

2886
03:16:52,770 --> 03:16:54,630
What's the time for this game?

2887
03:16:58,160 --> 03:16:59,340
Okay, next.

2888
03:17:02,690 --> 03:17:03,630
This one.

2889
03:17:04,710 --> 03:17:06,670
Thank you guys for letting me use the walkthrough.

2890
03:17:06,910 --> 03:17:08,290
I really appreciate it.

2891
03:17:09,050 --> 03:17:09,310
Air.

2892
03:17:14,860 --> 03:17:16,180
And water.

2893
03:17:18,200 --> 03:17:39,350
Obviously, you would magically know by doing the following consider your current situation is it like what they were paired with upstairs I don't think so I don't think these these they were paired like this on the stairs and last but not least this room which is fire

2894
03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:53,980
fire you just keep trying until you can try no holy cow oh my gosh imagine all the pieces of paper people just like Okay, I tried this one.

2895
03:17:54,400 --> 03:17:55,000
Oh, my gosh.

2896
03:17:55,180 --> 03:17:57,620
I can't even imagine how long this would take.

2897
03:17:58,780 --> 03:17:59,360
I can't.

2898
03:18:00,460 --> 03:18:01,440
Fire, fire.

2899
03:18:01,680 --> 03:18:02,400
Like the fire.

2900
03:18:03,620 --> 03:18:05,840
I can't even imagine how long this would take.

2901
03:18:17,040 --> 03:18:18,220
Let's hit 30, baby.

2902
03:18:19,100 --> 03:18:20,260
The big three-hole.

2903
03:18:24,640 --> 03:18:27,900
I just saw the rest of the walkthrough, and I'm very excited.

2904
03:18:31,120 --> 03:18:31,600
Yahoo!

2905
03:18:31,740 --> 03:18:32,680
What are you doing?

2906
03:18:32,920 --> 03:18:33,260
Melanie.

2907
03:18:33,980 --> 03:18:34,320
Brent.

2908
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:34,620
Oh.

2909
03:18:34,640 --> 03:19:58,760

2910
03:20:05,780 --> 03:20:08,180
Oh my god, we're fading!

2911
03:20:10,280 --> 03:20:11,360
He lied!

2912
03:20:12,040 --> 03:20:13,080
Wait, what happened to us?

2913
03:20:18,920 --> 03:20:20,400
Oh, we're back!

2914
03:20:22,800 --> 03:20:25,520
But we're gonna fall into the pit again.

2915
03:20:36,200 --> 03:20:37,800
Did we...

2916
03:20:40,710 --> 03:20:43,790
This is how Melanie came walking in.

2917
03:20:45,090 --> 03:20:45,470
Wait.

2918
03:20:48,760 --> 03:20:49,240
Rent?

2919
03:20:51,400 --> 03:20:51,420
Yes?

2920
03:20:52,240 --> 03:20:52,280
Yes?

2921
03:20:52,620 --> 03:20:53,100
Yes?

2922
03:20:53,180 --> 03:20:54,300
I'm still alive.

2923
03:20:55,060 --> 03:20:56,140
It would appear so.

2924
03:20:56,240 --> 03:20:56,560
Where?

2925
03:20:57,380 --> 03:20:57,660
Where are we?

2926
03:20:57,720 --> 03:20:59,740
Did they, maybe because...

2927
03:20:59,740 --> 03:20:59,960
Wait.

2928
03:21:00,220 --> 03:21:01,720
We must be back in our own time.

2929
03:21:02,880 --> 03:21:03,840
My god, the ritual.

2930
03:21:04,140 --> 03:21:05,840
We must get to Stonehenge immediately.

2931
03:21:06,300 --> 03:21:07,780
Sinclair is going to complete the ritual.

2932
03:21:08,240 --> 03:21:10,540
Come on, Melanie, we've got to try to stop him.

2933
03:21:11,060 --> 03:21:13,840
Why didn't we stop him back then?

2934
03:21:14,080 --> 03:21:16,440
What was the point of going back in time?

2935
03:21:19,660 --> 03:21:20,800
What was the point?

2936
03:21:31,360 --> 03:21:32,200
For fun.

2937
03:21:32,660 --> 03:21:35,760
We could have broken the little stick and then it would have been fine.

2938
03:21:38,320 --> 03:21:39,440
To get the mistletoe.

2939
03:21:39,640 --> 03:21:40,340
It has to be.

2940
03:21:40,440 --> 03:21:41,020
It has to be.

2941
03:21:41,180 --> 03:21:41,560
It has to be.

2942
03:21:41,680 --> 03:21:42,200
It has to be.

2943
03:21:42,920 --> 03:21:43,120
Oh!

2944
03:21:48,810 --> 03:21:49,670
St. Clair!

2945
03:21:54,190 --> 03:21:59,150
Mr. Halligan, have you come to witness our finest hour?

2946
03:21:59,870 --> 03:22:01,230
Very well, my friend.

2947
03:22:01,610 --> 03:22:08,230

2948
03:22:11,700 --> 03:22:18,040

2949
03:22:21,840 --> 03:22:25,160

2951
03:22:41,230 --> 03:22:45,630
Shias ruined I don't know how I would know to do this

2952
03:23:05,030 --> 03:23:05,910
Oh what

2953
03:23:27,950 --> 03:23:31,030
It's because he said no harm would come to them.

2954
03:23:31,890 --> 03:23:33,530
I guess he didn't say until when.

2955
03:23:34,130 --> 03:23:35,250
This could be forever.

2956
03:23:37,250 --> 03:23:39,230
Why is everybody frozen?

2957
03:23:57,480 --> 03:23:58,200
Wait!

2958
03:24:00,080 --> 03:24:01,680
The healing mistletoe!

2959
03:24:03,080 --> 03:24:04,880
It's not just regular mistletoe!

2960
03:24:05,520 --> 03:24:07,980
Remember, guys, it's healing mistletoe.

2961
03:24:08,640 --> 03:24:10,520
Oh my god, oh my god!

2962
03:24:10,860 --> 03:24:13,780
Have they gone now?

2963
03:24:14,420 --> 03:24:15,900
Yes, yes, they've gone.

2964
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:16,800
Oh god, what a sight.

2965
03:24:16,840 --> 03:24:17,500
Everything will be okay.

2966
03:24:17,840 --> 03:24:18,700
Just lie still.

2967
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:22,400
Brent...

2968
03:24:22,400 --> 03:24:24,480
Brent, am I going to die?

2969
03:24:25,640 --> 03:24:26,120
Nonsense.

2970
03:24:26,960 --> 03:24:28,300
You're going to be just fine.

2971
03:24:28,340 --> 03:24:29,220
That's what you told Malgoy too.

2972
03:24:29,220 --> 03:24:30,500
Just lie completely still.

2973
03:24:30,660 --> 03:24:31,560
I'll go and get help.

2974
03:24:33,080 --> 03:24:34,860
Don't go and get help!

2975
03:24:36,360 --> 03:24:38,260
Brent, it's cold here.

2976
03:24:39,640 --> 03:24:40,560
I'm so cold.

2977
03:24:40,820 --> 03:24:41,380
Oh no!

2978
03:24:43,020 --> 03:24:43,020
Melanie!

2979
03:24:43,640 --> 03:24:43,860
Melanie!

2980
03:24:47,280 --> 03:24:49,300
Use the healing mistletoe!

2981
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:52,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2982
03:25:00,640 --> 03:25:02,380
Oh, you just put it on top?

2983
03:25:02,500 --> 03:25:03,460
Is that how that works?

2984
03:25:04,200 --> 03:25:05,540
Oh, it's magic.

2985
03:25:09,450 --> 03:25:10,270
Oh my god.

2986
03:25:10,790 --> 03:25:13,510
Not the way I thought we'd be using the mistletoe.

2987
03:25:15,050 --> 03:25:15,770
Melanie.

2988
03:25:17,930 --> 03:25:18,230
Brent.

2989
03:25:19,390 --> 03:25:20,250
What did you do?

2990
03:25:22,510 --> 03:25:24,290
I just practiced a bit of magic.

2991
03:25:24,730 --> 03:25:25,290
That's all.

2992
03:25:26,750 --> 03:25:28,050
Now we laugh together.

2993
03:25:30,870 --> 03:25:31,110
No.

2994
03:25:31,530 --> 03:25:31,610
Shh.

2995
03:25:43,640 --> 03:25:44,520
I

2996
03:25:52,900 --> 03:25:54,340
am milk.

2997
03:26:04,600 --> 03:26:06,980
I've been tears.

2998
03:26:12,660 --> 03:26:15,380
Who didn't die in this game?

2999
03:26:17,320 --> 03:26:19,020
Girl, he stabbed you.

3000
03:26:24,720 --> 03:26:26,940
Would that work on you?

3001
03:26:28,180 --> 03:26:28,880
I don't know.

3002
03:26:32,900 --> 03:26:47,680
I think it would be quite exciting to see, um, to see, uh, a druid cult die, uh, be evaporated, Thanos in front of my eyes.

3003
03:26:47,880 --> 03:26:48,720
So who knows?

3004
03:26:49,860 --> 03:26:53,200
You have to watch the mystery of the druids ending animation after the credits.

3005
03:26:53,460 --> 03:26:53,660
Okay.

3006
03:26:53,840 --> 03:26:54,840
There's an after credits?

3007
03:26:55,100 --> 03:26:55,640
Let's go.

3008
03:26:58,940 --> 03:27:07,520
The team wishes to thank all who supported us during the production, with patience and understanding, suggestions, and criticism, but also with warm meals and walks at Moonlight.

3009
03:27:08,880 --> 03:27:09,800
How romantic.

3010
03:27:12,180 --> 03:27:14,460
No wonder it was such a romantic ending.

3011
03:27:16,160 --> 03:27:16,500
Wow.

3012
03:27:18,620 --> 03:27:19,660
Oh, wow.

3013
03:27:25,440 --> 03:27:26,860
How's a piece of power?

3014
03:27:27,760 --> 03:27:28,720
Screams and Butler.

3015
03:27:28,860 --> 03:27:29,360
Oh, okay.

3016
03:27:30,300 --> 03:27:31,000
I see, I see.

3017
03:27:32,680 --> 03:27:33,920
Where's the explosions?

3018
03:27:37,120 --> 03:27:37,780
I guess we didn't.

3019
03:27:37,880 --> 03:27:38,100
We did.

3020
03:27:38,400 --> 03:27:40,440
Some endings don't go out with a bang.

3021
03:27:41,180 --> 03:27:42,860
Well, maybe they did.

3022
03:28:01,470 --> 03:28:02,830
The ending is...

3023
03:28:02,830 --> 03:28:04,010
The music is so quiet.

3024
03:28:07,250 --> 03:28:11,210
Al-Halligan could have sacrificed himself, but he had to be a psycho.

3025
03:28:11,690 --> 03:28:13,430
He has a lust for blood.

3026
03:28:13,430 --> 03:28:15,990
and in crimes.

3027
03:28:16,730 --> 03:28:17,850
He's like, I've gotten...

3028
03:28:17,850 --> 03:28:18,550
Oh my god.

3029
03:28:19,850 --> 03:28:21,930
He's like, I've gotten away with everything so far.

3030
03:28:22,070 --> 03:28:23,290
Can I get away with murder?

3031
03:28:37,040 --> 03:28:39,160
What a house of tales indeed.

3032
03:28:39,980 --> 03:28:42,340
What a story that was.

3033
03:28:43,920 --> 03:28:46,020
The Druid's ending animation is a fan production.

3034
03:28:46,520 --> 03:28:47,000
Oh, okay.

3035
03:28:47,100 --> 03:28:48,660
Oh, this is just...

3036
03:28:48,660 --> 03:28:50,840
Okay, this is just the opening of the game again.

3037
03:28:54,630 --> 03:28:57,150
Because there was no opening.

3038
03:29:00,850 --> 03:29:04,510
There was no title menu is what I meant to say.

3039
03:29:11,670 --> 03:29:13,530
Fan ending song.

3040
03:29:13,910 --> 03:29:16,370
What the hell are you guys telling me to look up here?

3041
03:29:18,930 --> 03:29:20,030
What am I looking up?

3042
03:29:22,150 --> 03:29:24,350
Mystery of the Druids.

3043
03:29:26,790 --> 03:29:27,270
Ending.

3044
03:29:28,750 --> 03:29:30,530
Is this gonna give me copyright strike?

3045
03:29:36,320 --> 03:29:37,880
Wait, which one is it?

3046
03:29:38,060 --> 03:29:39,300
I don't know.

3047
03:29:42,560 --> 03:29:43,040
Zillofenko?

3048
03:29:43,340 --> 03:29:43,520
Okay.

3049
03:29:44,480 --> 03:29:45,420
Give me one second.

3050
03:29:45,540 --> 03:29:49,080
Oh, now I get to watch the Mandalore game.

3051
03:29:49,120 --> 03:29:51,860
That's the video you guys were saying to watch, right?

3052
03:29:51,920 --> 03:29:55,160
After I beat the game was the Mandalore gaming?

3053
03:30:00,150 --> 03:30:00,950
It shouldn't?

3054
03:30:01,050 --> 03:30:01,570
Okay, cool.

3055
03:30:03,150 --> 03:30:04,610
Uh, let me do this.

3056
03:30:09,790 --> 03:30:11,150
One moment, please.

3057
03:30:11,430 --> 03:30:13,350
Oh, let me open the animation.

3058
03:30:14,730 --> 03:30:15,110
Oh, wait.

3059
03:30:15,530 --> 03:30:16,570
Oh, this works, actually.

3060
03:30:17,710 --> 03:30:18,810
Okay, give me a second.

3061
03:30:22,350 --> 03:30:23,850
Uh, window capture.

3062
03:30:28,190 --> 03:30:30,310
And, oh, oh, it already worked.

3063
03:30:30,510 --> 03:30:31,990
How handy duty is that?

3064
03:30:32,990 --> 03:30:35,630

Okay.

3068
03:31:47,320 --> 03:31:48,400
Let's watch.

3069
03:31:50,380 --> 03:31:54,900
Incognito, I don't know why, because it's called private browsing and Firefox.

3070
03:31:55,220 --> 03:31:56,260
I was like, what's the name again?

3071
03:31:56,400 --> 03:31:58,080
Okay, here we go.

3072
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:09,320
Oh.

3073
03:32:20,590 --> 03:32:21,990
Oh,

3074
03:32:34,200 --> 03:32:37,820
my gosh.

3075
03:32:50,820 --> 03:32:54,120
They all have an attitude.

3076
03:32:54,520 --> 03:32:55,540
Skeleton eyes!

3077
03:32:55,540 --> 03:32:55,880
The truth are coming.

3078
03:32:56,300 --> 03:32:57,400
The truth are scary.

3079
03:32:57,780 --> 03:33:00,440
The Scotland Yard is getting wary.

3080
03:33:00,780 --> 03:33:03,440
But Alakins coming to solve the quarrel.

3081
03:33:03,800 --> 03:33:03,800
Don't

3082
03:33:10,450 --> 03:33:11,630
have an attitude.

3083
03:33:12,490 --> 03:33:14,430
It's the mystery of the truth.

3084
03:33:14,530 --> 03:33:15,470
This is so cute.

3085
03:33:23,120 --> 03:33:23,860
No

3086
03:33:31,180 --> 03:33:32,600
time for women.

3087
03:33:41,580 --> 03:33:43,740
I wish we could have gone on a beach vacation.

3088
03:33:46,480 --> 03:33:47,000
Yeah!

3089
03:33:55,440 --> 03:33:55,960
Cute.

3090
03:33:57,640 --> 03:33:59,600
Is that why everybody calls it druids?

3091
03:34:00,100 --> 03:34:01,340
Mystery of the druids?

3092
03:34:03,400 --> 03:34:04,660
Instead of druids?

3093
03:34:05,040 --> 03:34:07,060
And that's why they all have an attitude?

3094
03:34:11,760 --> 03:34:12,280
Yes.

3095
03:34:12,540 --> 03:34:13,620
Oh, I've learned!

3096
03:34:13,740 --> 03:34:14,380
I've learned!

3097
03:34:15,260 --> 03:34:17,160
Some characters in the game says druids.

3098
03:34:17,280 --> 03:34:17,540
Really?

3099
03:34:17,660 --> 03:34:18,340
I didn't hear.

3100
03:34:18,720 --> 03:34:20,240
I tried looking out for it.

3101
03:34:24,700 --> 03:35:00,720
speaking of deadly premonition actually that's on my list of things to play so probably maybe like next month spooky month right try princess thank you thank you thank you thank you what a journey this was hmm sure was something Halligan stayed true to himself and was an awful human being until the very end and he still got the girl girl i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna have nightmares about him like brushing her lips like that what

3102
03:35:05,160 --> 03:35:08,000

3103
03:35:11,670 --> 03:35:12,790

03:35:21,990 --> 03:35:51,950

3106
03:36:08,830 --> 03:36:12,490
Oh, and she saw all the pizza boxes.

3107
03:36:13,430 --> 03:36:15,410
It must have been a moment of weakness for her.

3108
03:36:16,310 --> 03:36:18,130
I can't imagine they stay together.

3109
03:36:19,770 --> 03:36:21,530
It was a moment of weakness.

3110
03:36:23,550 --> 03:36:24,810
It must have been.

3111
03:36:28,710 --> 03:36:30,950
Because there's just no way.

3112
03:36:31,210 --> 03:36:45,850
She's like, oh yeah, like later on they're going to be like, he's going to be like, so about that pizza date she's gonna be like oh sorry about that pizza date she's gonna be like oh that date we never found out what happened to the royal family
