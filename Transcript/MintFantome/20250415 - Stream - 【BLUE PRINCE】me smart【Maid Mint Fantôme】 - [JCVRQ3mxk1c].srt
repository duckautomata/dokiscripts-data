00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,950
Welcome back, master and mistress!

2
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,150
Hello!

3
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,330
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

4
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:14,950
Hello to you, hello to you, hello to you, hello to you, hello to you, hello to you, hello to you, hello to you, hello to you!

5
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,190
And you, the viewer.

6
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,370
Ow.

7
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,950
And maybe the viewer as well.

8
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:23,910
Good morning!

9
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,710
Good morning!

10
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,110
Oh, me?

11
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,210
Yeah, you!

12
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,810
Minto Public Broadcasting.

13
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,570
Some people aren't at home.

14
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,430
Some people might be...

15
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,430
Some people are...

16
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,470
I was hoping to see a derp face like the thumbnail.

17
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,510
Oh, you know what?

18
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,250
I should have done Chibi Minto, huh?

19
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,510
No, the head would have been way too big.

20
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,130
She would have been...

21
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,090
She would have solved everything in two seconds.

22
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,190
The viewer at home, that's me!

23
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,890
What, you!

24
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,230
Thank you, Terry!

25
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,210
Thank you, Austin!

26
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,470
Thank you, Pentobopancho!

27
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,690
Thank you, guys!

28
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,070
My third bit stole me.

29
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,410
My Minto keychain was cute.

30
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,930
Glad you liked it.

31
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,010
Oh my gosh.

32
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,250
Good morning, Minto from Australia!

33
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,730
Australia!

34
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,050
G'day, mate.

35
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,710
Bloomin' Onion.

36
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,150
I wanna go to...

37
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,610
Outback Steakhouse.

38
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,770
You know, as funny as the first time I ever had the Bloomin' Onion...

39
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,050
at Outback Steakhouse was...

40
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,230
not in the United States of America, but in Japan.

41
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,410
I don't really go to Outback very much.

42
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,410
G'day, Minto.

43
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:03,970
G'day.

44
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,110
Oh gosh.

45
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,330
There was something that you would say that makes it sound like you're saying something...

46
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,250
with an Australian accent.

47
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,410
I can't remember.

48
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,910
Thank you for all the memberships, you guys.

49
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,890
Thank you, Jesse!

50
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,830
Thank you for the five gifts.

51
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,050
Welcome back!

52
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,250
Welcome back!

53
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,910
Welcome back!

54
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,010
Tentide.

55
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,430
Welcome back!

56
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,770
I have to read the katakana.

57
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:38,790
KFBSkitwinner.

58
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,350
Oh my gosh.

59
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,270
Welcome back!

60
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,910
Sendo, welcome back.

61
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,370
Cuddlyzombie, welcome back.

62
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,110
Oracle, welcome back.

63
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,350

Redfun, welcome back.

66
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,430
Oh my gosh, there's so many.

67
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:50,850
DerpyPuggyFamily.

68
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,890
PugFamily, welcome back.

69
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,690
12AB, welcome back.

70
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,490
Daner, welcome back.

71
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,390
There's too many!

72
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,550
Oh, right.

73
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,050
That's right.

74
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,250
RiseUpLight.

75
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,170
RiseUpLight.

76
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,990
Sounds like I'm saying razor blades.

77
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:05,910
Yeah, that's the one.

78
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,510
It's all green.

79
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,810
It's all green.

80
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,590
I'm on a plane with wifi.

81
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,770
Not quite strong enough for watching streams off to catch the VOD.

82
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,430
We call that the blue archive.

83
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,750
Have a safe flight, Tom!

84
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,710
CM Green, welcome back everybody.

85
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,930
Thank you so much.

86
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,870
Thank you!

87
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,350
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

88
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,370
Oh gosh, I don't even know if I can go through all of those, but thank you.

89
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,250
A whole year.

90
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,410
A whole year.

91
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,470
I know my moves.

92
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,430
So yeah, welcome back.

93
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,610
Where have I been?

94
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,490
It's green.

95
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,490
Thank you!

96
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,570
I'm happy.

97
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,070
Pugbug, thank you for the gifted.

98
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,430
Thank you.

99
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,550
Today, we must expand our brains.

100
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,930
I have paper here.

101
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,530
For notes.

102
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,190
I saw people saying that you should have pen and paper for notes for this game.

103
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,510
Don't eat it.

104
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,350
Well, now that you're telling me not to...

105
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,550
But this game, Blueprints, actually for...

106
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,910
I've had this on my list for like weeks now.

107
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,390
I've been seeing it so much.

108
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,390
I get like some game recommendations through TikTok.

109
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,450
And so I've been seeing it a lot on there.

110
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,550
People being like this, I can't, I don't know if they're paid or not.

111
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,290
Paid advertising.

112
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,970
But people have been like, this is like indie game of the year.

113
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,970
It's so cool.

114
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,990
It's like so...

115
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,130
It's so...

116
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,870
It's unique.

117
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,270
It's really fun.

118
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,510
So I've been very interested.

119
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,650
So basically, it's like a puzzle roguelike.

120
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,950
But you're trying to get through this house.

121
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:25,210
And only through unlocking more stuff can you actually get further into the house.

122
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,190
So...

123
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,790
It's roguelike Myst.

124
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,170
So...

126
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,890
Seems like maybe everybody's playthroughs will be a little bit different.

127
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,510
So if you like what you see too, you know, maybe try it out.

128
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,010
I don't know.

129
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,470
I don't know how it is.

130
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,050
I'm 16 hours in.

131
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,370
And it feels like I'm drowning in mystery.

132
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,650
No way.

133
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,190
Wow.

134
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,490
Love it.

135
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,010
You have a great day in stream.

136
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,810
Thank you.

137
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,810
I've loved this game a lot.

138
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,850
Played many hours myself.

139
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,170
Dozens left to go, I think.

140
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,490
I've got 10 pages full of handwriting notes at this point.

141
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,790
This game is insanely good.

142
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,090
Yeah.

143
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,370
I guess...

144
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,730
I guess there was like a...

145
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,870
What do you call?

146
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,490
Like a demo...

147
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,710
Out before this.

148
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,490
Because I heard some people already knew that this game was going to be really good.

149
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,070
And then the full game was released just a couple of days ago.

150
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,030
10 pages of home notes.

151
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,330
I'm into almost a year.

152
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:24,990
Awesome.

153
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,550
It's my birthday?

154
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,490
What?

155
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,170
Check.

156
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,770
What name do you want?

157
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,470
Aisling?

158
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,210
Which name do you want?

159
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:38,730
What?

160
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,740
Wow, bears!

161
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,560
Thank you for the 20!

162
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,660
Thank you!

163
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

164
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

165
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,340
Thank you, thank you.

166
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,180
Where's the text for the tonal?

167
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,400
I will lurk to avoid spoilers.

168
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,040
I don't think we'll probably get so much into it.

169
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
But I understand.

170
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,580
Might be one...

171
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,800
I saw...

172
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,260
On Steam it says...

173
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,720
For those who like...

174
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,300
Outer Wilds.

175
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,700
So I'm like...

176
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,780
That's extremely promising.

177
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,900
Sorry, I just went to the Steam page.

178
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,420
That's like super...

179
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:21,740
Right?

180
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,260
That's like so...

181
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,460
The real puzzle here is how Minto is so cute.

182
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,220
Oh, sorry.

183
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,080
You know, I'll go over just by your first one.

184
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,700
For the birthday.

185
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
Happy birthday to you.

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,020
Happy birthday to you.

187
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,520
Happy birthday, holo aneki.

188
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
Happy birthday to you.

189
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,800
Happy birthday!

190
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,120
Your name reminded me of a video I saw...

191
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,520
Recently.

192
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,310
About...

193
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,460
Like the origin...

194
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,110
You know how when you go to a Japanese...

195
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,180
Vtuber...

196
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,840
And they say like...

197
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,340
Outer Wilds.

198
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,980
And...

199
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,240
If you ever wondered what that word came from...

200
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,840
It actually is like...

201
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,120
What was it?

202
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,720
The full word is like niki niki.

203
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,800
I believe.

204
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,060
And it was like...

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,520
It was...

206
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,540
It basically is like a different way...

207
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,140
It's like a...

208
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,760
I think it was...

209
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,060
Hold on.

210
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,800
Now I'm trying to remember.

211
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,400
I think it was like a gender neutral way of saying like...

212
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,920
Aniki or aneki.

213
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,040
Right?

214
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,000
And so...

215
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,600
Outer Wilds is like...

216
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
A shortened way of saying like...

217
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,680
You know...

218
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
The aniki.

219
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,340
So it's literally actually overseas bros.

220
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,300
How so many people translate it.

221
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,700
Which is so funny.

222
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,620
I never knew.

223
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,720
I never knew.

224
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,660
I never knew the origin.

225
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,460
Yeah, me neither.

226
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,620
This game was on my horizon for a long while.

227
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,680
I've been enjoying it so much.

228
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,140
I need more games like this in my life.

229
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,360
Outer Wilds type stuff.

230
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,720
Good luck.

231
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,320
Thanks, Zelo!

232
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:05,920
Let's...

233
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,320
Shall we get started then?

234
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,140
Yeah, now you guys...

235
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,400
Now...

236
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,180
You guys...

237
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:12,880
No.

238
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,600
Take that over.

239
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,040
Gaijin.

240
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,980
It's actually...

241
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,140
Like a...

242
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,260
It's actually like a nicer way of saying...

243
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,000
Gaikokujin.

244
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,820
So yeah.

245
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,220
Vivi says...

246
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,100
Kaigainiki neki.

247
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,100
Only one I've heard to do that.

248
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,440
But yeah.

249
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,060
So I think it's been shortened.

250
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,600
You know, Japanese always is being shortened.

251
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,860
So kaigainiki.

252
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,160
Shortened to...

253
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,340
Kaigainiki neki.

254
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,760
When you're addicted to me too.

255
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,480
Thank you.

256
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,180
Stay addicted.

257
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,240
Stay addicted.

258
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm just kidding.

259
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,240
It's on my first paycheck.

260
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,920
Thank you.

261
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,560
You should've got something yummy with it.

262
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,700
You should've instead.

263
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,240
Hi.

264
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:03,840
Hi.

265
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:05,820
Hi.

266
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,940
Okay.

267
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,220
Alright.

268
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,920
Time to be brained.

269
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,920
Let's do this.

270
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:25,870
Don't go bomb.

271
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,190
Wow, Frank.

272
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,410
Welcome to membership of BigHandAnime.

273
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,590
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

274
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,810
In association with Raw Fury.

275
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,830
Thanks.

276
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,410
Welcome to membership.

277
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,090
So many membership things today.

278
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,610
I'm scared.

279
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,140
Sorry.

280
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,540
Don't jump at me like that, mister.

281
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:15,890
Codicils.

282
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,700
What's the P stand for?

283
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,120
Oh, it's just a jump scare.

284
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,550
Holy cannoli.

285
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,350
What oil mine did this man own?

286
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,580
Oh, is this

287
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,440
timed?

288
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,800
It's April.

289
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,100
Happy

290
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,570
birthday.

291
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,290
I'll say happy birthday once the curtain door blueprints.

292
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,330
It's so blue.

293
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,490
Is that...wait maybe the P stands for prince.

294
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,690
I wonder if you can like...

295
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,130
Speedrun this game.

296
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,690
Wait, what does it mean 50 in the...

297
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,650
I only have 49 steps left?

298
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,770
Wait, what do you mean by that?

299
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,710
Okay, hold on.

300
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,690
Let me sing happy birthday to you real quick, Daniel.

301
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,070
Happy birthday to you.

302
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,910
Happy birthday to you.

303
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,090
Happy birthday dear Daniel.

304
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,950
Happy birthday to you.

305
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:56,850
Okay,

306
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,600
wait I'm not losing him anymore.

307
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,680
What's this?

308
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,520
Exhausting.

309
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,060
Searching the estate can be exhausting.

310
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,300
Each time you enter a room you lose it.

311
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,440
Also because I stepped outside and then stepped back inside.

312
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,380
When you no longer have any feet left, you will be too tired to continue searching the manor and must call it a day.

313
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,760
Open only in the event of my death.

314
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,100
Simon, welcome to Mount Holly.

315
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:36,020
You may not remember, but I have fond memories of your many visits here as a young boy.

316
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:42,220
And I hope these rooms provide you with as much amusement as it did in those last summer days.

317
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:49,400
By the time you read this, I will assume you are fully aware of my last wishes and all the details of the bequest.

318
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,360
Please do not mistake my intentions in giving you this challenge as a lack of confidence.

319
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,500
I assure you, nothing could have been further from my mind when I chose you as my heir.

320
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,780
With that said, there are a few ground rules of this commission covered in the fine print of my will that I feel I should bring to your attention.

321
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,180
No fee.

322
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,840
No tools or items may be brought onto the estate from the outside.

323
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,580
Tools and items found on the estate may not be taken off the estate.

324
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,400
You may not stay overnight.

325
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,440
Is this place haunted?

326
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,520
What do you mean I can't stay overnight?

327
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:39,440
I don't suspect that any of these stipulations should prove an impediment for someone as resourceful as yourself, but it is very important to me that you start fresh each morning and not rely on the successes of the previous day.

328
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh my gosh, roguelike.

329
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Sneaky goose.

330
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,360
One final word of advice.

331
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,200
Do not assume the rooms you find today will be the same rooms you find tomorrow.

332
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,830
Imagine you like, you live here and you're just like, I'm so tired.

333
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,530
It's been such a long day at work.

334
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,350
And you have to find your bedroom every day.

335
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,130
It's in like a different spot.

336
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:19,030
These grounds have provided me a home for the last half century and even I am uncertain of which room lies beyond any particular door.

337
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,630
How do you live like this?

338
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,690
Your grandmother used to say, don't go where the path leads.

339
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,610
Abandon the path and go where you want it to lead.

340
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,750
Wow, such a non-beady lifestyle.

341
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,130
It must be nice never having to have...

342
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,290
Never having to be like, what if you're in a hurry?

343
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,730
What if you have to find the bathroom?

344
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,590
What do you do?

345
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,530
This reminds me of Rose Red.

346
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,950
Actually, I feel like I've mentioned Rose Red quite often.

347
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,430
Rose Red was one of my favorite Stephen King's...

348
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,810
I never read it.

349
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,270
It was one of my favorite Stephen King's stories though.

350
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,410
So I reference it a lot.

351
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,370
Hi Minky, have fun playing Blueprints.

352
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,010
I heard it was really fun and puzzling.

353
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,590
Whoa, Delta, are you okay?

354
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

355
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,630
Maybe your cat went on the...

356
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,650
Are you okay?

357
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,810
Maybe your cat is on the keyboard.

358
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,990
How many times do you have to change the layout of this house, old man?

359
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,190
Game gives me the Forgotten City vibes.

360
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:34,710
Have fun, Minto.

361
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,830
Thanks, Chucky.

362
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,100
Hope you enjoy, Minto.

363
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,040
I got some stuff to do.

364
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,680
I'll be in and out.

365
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,600
Good luck with whatever you got doing.

366
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,420
I take it this game is the happy version of Stephen King's Rose Red.

367
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,400
Right?

368
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,360
With all my love and wishes, best of luck.

369
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,300
Herbert.

370
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,140
Is that an... Oh, shoot.

371
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,280
What is that?

372
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,000
That's not an S, is it?

373
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,580
Oh, yeah, it is.

374
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,160
Sinclair.

375
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,580
Okay, Gramps.

376
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,340
Oh, we have our Blueprints.

377
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,040
Fancy ass.

378
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,720
Don't scream.

379
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,640
You may access the Blueprint menu by pressing TAB.

380
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,360
This will serve as a useful map and inventory log during your adventure.

381
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,040
Oh, antechamber.

382
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,840
Where we can call... Oh, I'm on top of it.

383
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,040
There's call it a day.

384
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,900
Inventory.

385
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,260
Okay, neat.

386
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,220
Where should we go first?

387
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,820
Oh, do these mean anything?

388
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,580
Wow, she's hot.

389
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,860
Why'd they make the Queen look so beautiful?

390
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,510
I don't understand.

391
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,090
Benevolent House of Leaves.

392
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,600
It is...

393
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,380
Why does the clock look so weird?

394
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,280
Why is it like...

395
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,840
It almost...

396
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,780
It almost looks like it would be AI generated.

397
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,400
You know what I mean?

398
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,320
Why does it look like that?

399
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,250
It's not my birthday.

400
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,270
Happy not birthday to you.

401
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,130
What is this?

402
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,070
850.

403
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,160
Select a room to draft.

404
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,640
Whenever you enter this room...

405
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,020
Wait, what?

406
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,400
Wait, you get to choose what room you go into.

407
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,220
So we can get items or we can gain more feet.

408
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,980
My wisp tags.

409
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,040
No tags.

410
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,320
Let's try the bedroom.

411
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,400
Feet!

412
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,220
Plus 2 feet.

413
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,140
What do we have here?

414
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,300
Greetings from Redington.

415
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,320
Nothing on the back?

416
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,000
Anything in here?

417
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,180
Oh, mama.

418
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,120
She's got a pretty necklace.

419
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,620
Okay.

420
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,820
Also, I want to clarify.

421
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,580
I wasn't accusing this game of using AI art.

422
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,600
I was just saying that...

423
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,380
That the clock looked wonky.

424
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,080
I don't want people to think like...

425
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,180
Everybody will just say...

426
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,620
Someone will choose an AI art these days.

427
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,040
Or a Garmin.

428
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,480
A boudoir?

429
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,280
Hallway.

430
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,240
Storeroom.

431
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,440
I feel...

432
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,940
Oh wait, you have...

433
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,920
You must select one...

434
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,820
Okay, I can't close out of this.

435
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,020
So I have to choose something.

436
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,180
Too late.

437
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,940
Getting cancelled on Twitter.

438
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,200
Goodbye, my career.

439
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,740
Let's try this.

440
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,700
Because we need a key, no?

441
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,140
We can unlock this if we get a key.

442
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,440
From in here.

443
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,660
Little coin.

444
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,180
I have one coin.

445
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,780
Okay.

446
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,260
And key.

447
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,460
One key and a diamond.

448
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,700
Oh look, diamond.

449
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,470
I don't know what these are for yet, but...

450
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,260
And now we'll get two more feet.

451
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,480
Use.

452
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,800
Let's try it.

453
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,180
Oh!

454
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,690
Wow, so many doubloons and dice.

455
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,850
Ivory dice.

456
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,530
While drafting, you may use the dice to roll new floor plans.

457
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:56,770
Interesting.

458
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,330
Five doubloons.

459
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,750
Let's go.

460
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,790
Let's see.

461
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,550
Which one should we take?

462
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,790
Hmm...

463
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,100
Money and rerolls.

464
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,240
Yeah, so cool.

465
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,040
Thank you so much for the 20 gift and thank you!

466
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,340
I guess we'll just go this way.

467
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,860
So a corridor is always left unlocked.

468
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,480
Pantry.

469
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,520
Or den.

470
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,880
Maybe the corridor would be good.

471
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,150
Unless we're hungry for a snack.

472
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,650
Oh, the den gives you more doors.

473
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,590
Today is my birthday!

474
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,210
Metal Raccoon, happy birthday!

475
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,690
Happy birthday to you!

476
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,770
Happy birthday!

477
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,370
Also, you guys are so right.

478
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,150
We should look at the...

479
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,870
See, a corridor would make sense.

480
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,710
Or see, the den we wouldn't be able to do because the storeroom doesn't have any...

481
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,910
So corridor or pantry both make sense.

482
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,310
I think we'll go with the corridor then.

483
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,370
Happy birthday to my husband, Pen.

484
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,950
We share a birthday.

485
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:53,630
Oh my god!

486
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,310
There are so many birthdays today.

487
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:57,510
Why?

488
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,390
Happy birthday to you!

489
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,370
Happy birthday to you!

490
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,610
Happy birthday Pen and Soro so much!

491
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,590
Happy birthday to you!

492
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,350
That's so cute you guys share a birthday.

493
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,150
I think I'm going to go with the corridor.

494
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,070
This is our first run.

495
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,150
We can...

496
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,210
We can experiment.

497
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,130
What's in here?

498
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,950
I don't know what it means that it's never locked though.

499
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,150
Is this like... I can't tell if this game...

500
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,170
Like see, there are so many different types of paintings.

501
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,150
I can't tell if it's like a...

502
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,990
Atmospheric storytelling, like does this mean anything?

503
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,270
I don't know yet.

504
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,090
There's so much art.

505
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,270
Maybe we'll go with the hallway.

506
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,690
I don't know what the... What is the...

507
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,330
Are we trying to get to the antechamber?

508
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,670
Is that what the goal is?

509
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,890
Only one way... If it's not...

510
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:26,990
Significant...

511
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,650
Or rather if it is significant, there's just so much.

512
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,790
Doors in the west wing are more likely to be locked.

513
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,610
Interesting.

514
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:40,950
Thank you.

515
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,890
Doors in the west wing...

516
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,910
So like this side?

517
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,450
Anything over here?

518
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,610
Why is it... Why is it...

519
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,790
It's so quiet all of a sudden.

520
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,290
Plus 10!

521
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,790
It's a dead end!

522
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,410
We could do the... I think the den would be best.

523
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:14,850
Wait...

524
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,050
Lars, did you send superchat twice?

525
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,810
I think you accidentally did.

526
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,510
Or don't know, I mean.

527
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,470
The goal is to get to the antechamber.

528
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,370
The puzzles will give you aid towards the goals, but exploration is more important.

529
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:31,990
Understandable, understandable.

530
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,570
I want the 10 extra, but let's do the den.

531
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:40,490
I think it's more important to have a bunch of rooms, no?

532
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,030
What the hell is this?

533
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:53,890
Nahuel?

534
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,330
Nahuel?

535
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,030
I hope I said that right!

536
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,170
Thank you so much for the 10 gifts!

537
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,030
Thank you!

538
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,830
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

539
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,270
Really appreciate it.

540
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,870
Yummy.

541
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,690
And we have a trunk.

542
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,290
Oops, oops.

543
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:08,850
Here we go.

544
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,530
A trunk.

545
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:10,590
A trunk.

546
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,110
They really like clocks here.

547
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,790
Really?

548
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,350
They're a pretty big fan.

549
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,310
Of clocks.

550
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,910
Grandpa...

551
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,090
And locks.

552
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,370
Look, there's...

553
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,390
There's one, two, three, four...

554
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:47,410
Five, six, seven clocks in this room alone.

555
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,210
Damn, grandpa!

556
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,530
I think you need to hire an interior decorator.

557
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,710
Wait, this one is not moving anymore.

558
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,430
And it's also a different time.

559
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,770
Wait, it's...

560
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,070
10... wait.

561
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,630
Why is this one different?

562
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,650
Wait, they're all different.

563
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,510
Wait, no, these are... wait.

564
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,910
Am I wrong?

565
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,050
Wait, when did it become this time?

566
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,410
Wait, this one was still mov... wait.

567
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,550
I'm so confused.

568
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,850
Oh, now... no, nevermind, they are still...

569
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,130
Wow, they are actively moving.

570
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,190
Wait, so we started at 8.45 and now it's...

571
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,710
Not... it's nearly... wait.

572
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,590
Oh god, reading old clocks.

573
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,810
9.05.

574
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,610
Sorry, 10.05.

575
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,650
10.05, so it's been over an hour.

576
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,790
What is it?

577
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,690
What does this mean?

578
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,270
Okay, alright, let's go this way.

579
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,050
Analog, what did I say?

580
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,110
Gem requirement, I have that.

581
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,760
Drawing room might be good.

582
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,480
You may draw new floor plans while dra...

583
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,420
Or plus star...

584
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,840
Oh, old.

585
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,440
Am I wrong?

586
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,850
They like locks and clocks.

587
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,410
Are there socks somewhere in a box?

588
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,510
So mysterious.

589
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,110
Bochy the clock.

590
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,190
Bochy the lock.

591
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,070
Bochy the sock.

592
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,870
Bochy...

593
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,810
The glock.

594
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,250
I don't know what this means.

595
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,270
I'm sure this is, I guess, something else that you need to unlock things.

596
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,110
Let's try the drawing room, if we can get new...

597
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,670
What the hell?

598
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,430
Grandpa had one study.

599
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,330
Or, not one.

600
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,010
Just a...

601
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,470
Drawing floor plans.

602
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:27,250
Each time you click on a door, you will draw three floor plans, from which you must select one to draft.

603
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:32,830
However, there are some items and rooms that will allow you to redraw if you do not like the initial three options.

604
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:33,690
Yeah.

605
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,350
Oh my gosh, it's him!

606
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,510
How did you do that?

607
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,790
Did you draw yourself?

608
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,930
A self-portrait?

609
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,150
Before your death, grandpa?

610
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,310
Oh, wow!

611
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,690
What are these?

612
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,050
Why do they have these?

613
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,590
This is on the clock, too.

614
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,210
These, like, lines.

615
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,090
What is this, man?

616
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,290
Wait, I thought we'd be able to draw something.

617
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,730
Am I incorrect?

618
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,690
I thought we'd be able to create new types of rooms.

619
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,110
Nevermind.

620
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,230
Stride distance.

621
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,350
Yeah, scale chart.

622
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,070
The clock, remember?

623
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,050
I was wondering what it was on the clock, too.

624
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,830
Am I overthinking it?

625
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,510
I'm not sure.

626
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,650
I might be overthinking it.

627
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,830
Oh, you can reroll for free here, I guess.

628
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,630
Let's just... I'll just keep going up.

629
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,550
Oh, just kidding.

630
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,610
This way.

631
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:41,910
We have... Whoa!

632
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,550
Whenever you enter the chapel, lose a coin?

633
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,790
Hell no.

634
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,850
Wait, we can get ten...

635
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,550
We could get ten steps here and then go back to the...

636
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,290
To the hallway, I suppose, maybe.

637
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,230
Or I could re... Oh, wait, redraw.

638
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,050
Oh, I just get a free... Ah, I see.

639
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,590
Oh, it's a free one.

640
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,850
Okay.

641
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,430
Dang.

642
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,830
Maybe I should have done the bedroom.

643
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,390
I have to go back anyway.

644
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,950
Not much better.

645
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,310
I could re... I could do again.

646
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,630
I have two dice.

647
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,430
Items could be good.

648
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,770
True.

649
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,630
And it's not like...

650
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,550
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

651
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,250
So true.

652
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:51,950
Whoa!

653
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:53,850
What is this?

654
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,870
Commissure?

655
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,650
What is that?

656
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,670
Breaker box?

657
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,510
Or spare room.

658
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,870
It's a breaker box too.

659
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,050
Oh, commissary.

660
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:08,830
I can't read.

661
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,350
These ones are mysterious.

662
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,570
Items for sale.

663
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,650
Oh, that's why!

664
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,470
It's a shop.

665
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:28,510
Shop.

666
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,270
Yeah, sounds like we can buy stuff with our coins.

667
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,410
But I feel like it's a waste to...

668
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,410
It just goes straight into a dead end, no?

669
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,870
I wanna... I'm curious what the breaker box is for.

670
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,070
So I'm gonna have that.

671
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:45,790
What do you do?

672
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,210
Key card entry system.

673
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,480
Uh-huh.

674
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,720
So I guess if there was a room that needed a key card...

675
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,680
Wait, toggling the... Wait, I should read the danger first.

676
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,800
Toggling of breaker switches may result in unexpected loss of floor pad functionality.

677
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,180
Please call DC power if you require assistance.

678
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,080
What's a VAC indicator?

679
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,920
I don't know, but green should...

680
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,580
Wait, why is one blue?

681
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:49,590
Purple!

682
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,330
Wait, what if I do...

683
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,920
Wait, did I do green already?

684
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,100
Just turned it back to blue.

685
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,600
A mystery.

686
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,520
Indeed.

687
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,120
Indeed.

688
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,980
I don't know what this means.

689
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,120
But yeah, maybe if a room needed a key card...

690
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,000
Maybe that's unlocked now.

691
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,940
And then I turn... The gymnasium?

692
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
I think it was the one that...

693
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,040
The dark room... Maybe I should turn that back off since it's a dark room.

694
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,880
DOSUKA!

695
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,660
Bye bye!

696
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,920
I hope you are having a good day too!

697
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,860
Yeah, we don't know what the VAC indicator means yet, so I guess we'll come back to this.

698
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,620
I'll just leave it on for now.

699
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,780
And there's more drawings in here!

700
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,220
So we gotta go back.

701
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,340
Let's go through here now.

702
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,900
Security?

703
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,780
Security gives us also an empty...

704
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,280
Like this one we can't use, but security.

705
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,780
Let's try it.

706
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,590
Oh, cutscene.

707
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,410
Oh my god.

708
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,150
I'm a twink.

709
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,380
What's that?

710
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,040
What are we recording?

711
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,890
Grandpa... Are we about to play Five Nights at Freddy's?

712
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,430
Twinkie?

713
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,090
No, I've never had one of those.

714
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,910
The twinkie.

715
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,650
Are they any good?

716
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:39,230
No?

717
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,390
They're alright?

718
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,870
Never had one.

719
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,530
Think of sugar, but fluff.

720
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,010
I don't know.

721
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:51,830
Maybe.

722
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:57,050
That one's kind of creepy.

723
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,530
Oh my god, thank goodness there's no one behind us.

724
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,770
That would be so scary.

725
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,130
It me!

726
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,080
Wait, the me on the monitor is not moving.

727
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,880
Oh, yes I am.

728
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,610
Let's see what we got here.

729
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,070
Is that a pool?

730
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,290
Indoor pool.

731
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,270
Hi, dog.

732
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,590
That looks important.

733
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,770
Life sucks right now, thank goodness for a window door.

734
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,850
I'm sorry.

735
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,290
I hope everything's okay.

736
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,090
Oh no, our drink is just...

737
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,830
It's TV static.

738
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,890
Okay, we got some other stuff over here.

739
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,770
Let's see what we got here.

740
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:05,250
Microwave...

741
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,490
TV static coffee.

742
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,150
Static juice.

743
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,770
What do you mean staff notice?

744
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,490
We have a password.

745
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,950
I don't know when I should start writing things down.

746
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,110
I'm nervous.

747
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,710
I'm nervous.

748
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,110
You do not fail to clock in and out.

749
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,170
Doobly.

750
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,430
Doobly.

751
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:10,870
Do not further notice that antechamber has been unlocked and access levers are no longer required to grant entry.

752
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:17,850
Keycard access security doors are more likely to appear in the higher ranks of the estate.

753
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:29,790
Likewise, as the redundant security measure normal doors in the estate will also be more likely to be locked as you progress north.

754
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,830
Okay, so keys are probably going to be important.

755
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,430
So what?

756
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,150
Now I have to pay people too?

757
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,210
No!

758
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,170
Not hot dog!

759
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,870
What does this button do?

760
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,970
Mega, thank you so much for the dono.

761
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,590
I can't crouch or do anything else, I just realized.

762
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,010
Oh!

763
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,010
Blue memos equals true.

764
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,670
Red memos... wait.

765
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,270
Equals lie unless written by hand.

766
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,330
Okay, I am going to write this down then.

767
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,030
Wait!

768
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:21,190
Wait!

769
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,690
Remember we saw the red memo that said that the doors in the west are...

770
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:29,250
Okay, blue equals true.

771
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,890
Red equals lie.

772
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:39,570
Unless handwritten.

773
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,750
This one was blue, no?

774
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,530
This one is red!

775
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,110
Uh oh, so it's not unlocked.

776
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,990
But it looks unlocked in the video.

777
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:59,830
I mean it's wide open.

778
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,530
Oh wait, we don't know if that's the antechamber or not.

779
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,830
What else we got in here?

780
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,030
Hallways and storages and...

781
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,590
I'm scared, what if there is a baby?

782
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:18,410
I have a baby?

783
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,770
Oh wow, what is that?

784
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,790
Is that a tub?

785
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:24,990
A bathtub?

786
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,050
I can't tell.

787
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,470
Which way are we going?

788
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,130
We are going to the right.

789
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:37,430
Nursery!

790
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,910
Whenever you draft a bedroom, gain 5.

791
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,710
I can't do it though, I don't have any more jimmies.

792
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,270
But a nook would also be good because we get a key.

793
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,610
I think maybe the nook, no?

794
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,410
I think the nook would be more... because then we can also start heading up.

795
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,430
I'm grabbing the nook.

796
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,350
A journey noteworthy.

797
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:09,930
As you continue on your adventure, you may want to consider getting something to scribble down your notes and observations.

798
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:21,070
A pad, scrap of paper, or perhaps most fittingly, a journal, will prove to be an invaluable tool you will not regret having beside you on your journey.

799
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,290
Why is beside written like that?

800
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,090
Oddly forgotten!

801
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,310
Thank you so much for the 20 gunds, thank you!

802
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:29,130
Thank you, thank you.

803
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,530
Also, hi, are you German?

804
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,010
Hello, hello.

805
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,990
Why is it written like that?

806
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:37,210
I'm gonna write it down, beside.

807
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,610
Maybe they want me to write it.

808
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:56,430
Because they've mentioned... is there anything beside me?

809
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:58,830
Not a ghost, right?

810
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:00,550
Spooky.

811
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:02,310
Thank you, key.

812
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,700
Please don't be locked.

813
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,600
Ok.

814
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,640
What's... what's that?

815
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,520
No!

816
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,400
Everything's a dead end!

817
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,540
But I want to try the puzzle.

818
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,780
Well now that I have a key we can go back to the drawing room.

819
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:39,580
Or the hall... no, the hallway, I don't think I tried the other side.

820
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,360
Get the puzzle?

821
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,240
Let's try the puzzle.

822
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:46,920
Hello.

823
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:55,590
The statement on the white box is true.

824
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,290
Can we move to an oil rig altogether?

825
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,790
The only tax I have to pay is to you.

826
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:04,870
I wish.

827
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,950
I don't want to think about taxes, please.

828
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:09,890
I don't want to think about it.

829
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,470
There is a second wind-up key in this room.

830
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:15,570
Ok.

831
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:17,850
What's the first wind-up key?

832
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:21,630
The box... this box and the white box are both empty.

833
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,720
Wind-up key.

834
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,220
You found a rather curious wind-up key, a component of the parlor game.

835
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,580
And what does it say?

836
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,600
Dear Herbert, May the 2nd.

837
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,540
Too bad it's not May the 4th.

838
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,780
You need your writings beside you and not on top of your head?

839
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:48,560
Maybe.

840
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,800
Good playlist!

841
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,400
Thank you so much for the gifted, thank you!

842
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,660
A ViviCore, thank you for the gifted thing.

843
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,420
Your profile picture is scary, why do you keep changing it?

844
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,460
I don't like this one.

845
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,300
Change it!

846
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,060
Change it again!

847
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,820
May the 4th be with you.

848
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:16,720
It was a great honor receiving the invitation to dine at your estate with the old hams this past Thursday.

849
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:28,080
If I'm being frank, it had been quite a while since we had been seen in decent society, and we were beginning to worry that my wife's wit had lost its charm.

850
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,640
I have no delusions that my company is rival to hers.

851
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:33,740
A

852
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,820
ViviCore, thank you!

853
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,880
A Ducky, thank you for the gifted, thank you!

854
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:58,800
If I can refresh your memory, we both spent much of that evening discussing our mutual love of games and puzzles, and I had mentioned to you a rather singular parlor game I had played some years back involving three boxes of different colors.

855
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,700
You had pressed me to write with the particulars of this game when I found the time.

856
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:13,440
That I have included with this letter all the details you will need to share with guests should you be inclined to play this confounding game.

857
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,680
Always your friend, M.

858
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:16,580
Lowry.

859
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,820
There will always be at least one box which displays only true statements.

860
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,840
There will always be at least one box which displays only false statements.

861
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,540
Only one box has a prize within.

862
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,500
The other two are always empty.

863
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:40,900
Okay...

864
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,100
Well, what if this one's fake?

865
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,100
Wait, if this one's not... if this one's false...

866
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,240
Then... wait...

867
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,680
Check the sofa for money?

868
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,320
Move the pillows around.

869
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,460
Get your little fingers in there.

870
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,160
Wait...

871
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,300
There will always be at least one box which...

872
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,080
So, it could be two boxes that are false statements.

873
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,070
And that only one box has a prize within.

874
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,430
The other two are always empty.

875
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:19,890
And then, what did this one say?

876
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:23,350
This box and the white box are both empty.

877
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,090
But if...

878
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:32,190
If this one can't be false, I feel...

879
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:34,490
Because...

880
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:36,990
That would mean then there's two prizes.

881
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,790
But there's only one prize.

882
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,010
And then...

883
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,030
If this one's false, then there's not a second wind-up key.

884
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,370
And then...

885
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,490
Wait...

886
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,230
This one would be the one with the prize?

887
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:18,290
Not really, it just means both are empty.

888
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,830
One could have something and not the other.

889
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,870
Oh, I guess that's...

890
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,190
I guess that's fair.

891
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:23,910
It doesn't have to be...

892
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:27,950
A total annihilation.

893
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,670
I should've put on my glasses for this.

894
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,750
I don't think there's a second...

895
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,770
I like...

896
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,890
Would the wind-up key be in the box?

897
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,750
Wait a second, there's like little...

898
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,550
Little areas.

899
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:58,630
Explore.

900
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,050
Shando, welcome to membership.

901
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:02,830
Thank you.

902
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:10,590
It kinda doesn't help that I don't know what could possibly be in the boxes.

903
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:17,190
Like if it's only items to help you or if it also could be a wind-up key.

904
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,930
You know what I mean?

905
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,590
The second wind-up key in the box would be cheap.

906
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,810
That's how I feel, right?

907
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:33,250
So I feel like the white one would be false.

908
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,020
And then...

909
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,900
So that means the blue one is false as well.

910
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,460
It says in room, not in box.

911
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,060
True!

912
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,260
True, true, true.

913
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,460
Am I just like not...

914
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,560
There doesn't seem to be like anything I can move around or sift through.

915
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,100
And I can't crouch.

916
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,900
Gamers don't look up.

917
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,480
Nothing taped to the ceiling.

918
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,330
So black would be true.

919
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,210
But if they're all false...

920
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:17,350
Yes!

921
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,470
Adore!

922
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,610
Thank you so much for the 10 gift.

923
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,370
Thank you.

924
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,740
There's only one key.

925
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,340
So you're wrong.

926
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,100
There's a second wind-up key in this room.

927
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,000
There is not.

928
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,020
So you're also wrong.

929
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,860
And so you're right.

930
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,960
This box and the white box are both empty.

931
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,040
So then what if we try it on the blue box?

932
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,040
Number one is always true, yeah.

933
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,980
Let's try it!

934
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,280
Nice!

935
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,060
Nice!

936
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,480
Alright, let's go back to the drawing room.

937
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,060
Back to the drawing table.

938
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,640
I gotta watch my...

939
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,320
My steps though.

940
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,780
Isn't it usually a good thing if you're getting your steps in?

941
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,290
I wish I could see what that note was.

942
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,550
The note right here.

943
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:33,370
If it was handwritten or not.

944
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,810
Because if it's wrong and it...

945
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,410
Because it said that the west...

946
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,190
Estates...

947
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:44,150
The west estate is usually all locked.

948
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:47,410
But if it was lying to me...

949
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:50,890
Then...

950
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:53,810
Then...

951
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,510
It would be where we are at now.

952
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,590
Don't you have to go back to the hallway anyways?

953
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:05,830
Not necessarily because this door right here in front of us was locked.

954
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:07,030
And I just got a key.

955
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,830
So I could technically go forward.

956
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:11,870
Here.

957
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,710
Or we could try going over here.

958
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:18,110
We have two directions.

959
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,170
Wow, I kinda like just locked myself out of this corner.

960
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:22,850
But that's okay.

961
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,610
It was read and typed.

962
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,730
It was!

963
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:36,550
Let's go try it.

964
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,970
It's a lie!

965
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,990
It's a lie, it's a lie, it's a lie.

966
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,950
Let's go this way.

967
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:53,770
We could gain ten steps back.

968
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:55,670
I hate this.

969
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,370
Why does everything just go this way?

970
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,590
I'm not good at building my house apparently.

971
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:11,990
We could do the spare room, true.

972
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:15,310
You know what?

973
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:21,450
We need a door that goes like this.

974
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,270
Yeah, let's do the spare room.

975
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,970
Ten steps is always nice, true.

976
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,090
But I'm also... I don't know.

977
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:37,510
Like so!

978
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,670
Like so!

979
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:43,830
Oh my gosh, it's being so nice.

980
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:44,630
Food first.

981
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:45,650
Why do we need food?

982
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,420
What do we need food for?

983
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,460
Do we get more energy from that?

984
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:53,700
Let's try it.

985
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:56,680
Let's see what it means.

986
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,560
Hello, anybody here?

987
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,340
I'm curious about your wares.

988
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,680
The crow is true, but the boat is a lie.

989
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,660
Oh, today's menu.

990
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:12,560
The main... wait.

991
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,820
What did it say?

992
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,880
The main course is...

993
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,440
Oh yeah, banana!

994
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,180
Oh, I can't afford the club sandwich or the bacon and eggs.

995
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,460
Add morning room to today's draft pool.

996
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:33,370
Today's main course, lemon glazed salmon.

997
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,250
That sounds so good.

998
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,970
Thank you, Sammy!

999
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:49,430
Char broiled Cajun spiced salmon, lemon butter sauce served over spinach leaf.

1000
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,910
That's exactly... oh my gosh.

1001
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,670
If you just added rice, that's exactly...

1002
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:56,610
Well, maybe not the Cajun spice, but...

1003
00:58:57,690 --> 00:58:58,170
Lemon.

1004
00:58:58,650 --> 00:58:59,130
Lemon.

1005
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:02,430
Actually, my mom has like a great recipe for salmon.

1006
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,650
She puts like a type of...

1007
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:06,430
She like makes like a mayonnaise, something or other.

1008
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,090
And she puts that with some capers.

1009
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,710
I don't like the capers though.

1010
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:17,570
And she puts that on the salmon and then over rice with spinach and it's so good.

1011
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:19,950
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

1012
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,270
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

1013
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,450
Like a tartar sauce.

1014
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,250
I don't know.

1015
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,970
I'll have to ask her.

1016
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,530
I'll give you guys the recipe too.

1017
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:33,110
And you can have my childhood meal.

1018
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:42,530
Plus 20 feet, plus an additional 10 feet if you have an aquarium in your house.

1019
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:43,850
Wow.

1020
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:45,490
I don't have that.

1021
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:47,190
How do I get the main course?

1022
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,250
Oh, the main course is served only in the dining room.

1023
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:51,690
Let's get some banana.

1024
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,690
Plus three steps.

1025
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:55,850
Cool.

1026
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:57,130
Thanks.

1027
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:00,830
Now I'm hungry.

1028
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:01,870
A little bit.

1029
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,150
I don't know if I should have saved my coins, but whatever.

1030
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:10,470
Where are we going?

1031
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:12,790
Lava to...

1032
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,070
What's the...

1033
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,690
There's like nothing...

1034
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:18,800
I guess west...

1035
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:20,770
Oh wait, we can do the observatory.

1036
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,240
Ah...

1037
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,080
We need openings.

1038
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,260
Oh wait, west wing hall gives more.

1039
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:32,300
Sorry, I just noticed.

1040
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:33,800
Yeah, let's do that instead.

1041
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:39,510
Staff notice.

1042
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,250
June 15th, 1983.

1043
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:44,410
Out of respect for the late Lady Clara S.

1044
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:48,330
Epson, the west wing will be closed until further notice.

1045
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:58,330
While the floor plans associated with this wing have not been removed from the pool, we ask that staff members refrain from drafting them during this period of mourning.

1046
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:02,490
Likewise, any staff may draft...

1047
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,730
I'm in the west wing.

1048
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:13,370
Are we gonna get attacked?

1049
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,310
Look, even it's all boarded up.

1050
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:28,630
Nobody's been here.

1051
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:32,550
Nobody's been here for such a long time.

1052
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,390
Oh my gosh, what if the beast is here?

1053
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:35,570
Beauty and the Beast!

1054
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,020
Let's try going up first.

1055
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:57,690
Pantry.

1056
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:02,710
We can get four items.

1057
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,690
I still have a dice, I still have a key, I still have a gem.

1058
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,810
I would have to use my gem to get the items.

1059
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,090
It would be a dead end though, unfortunately.

1060
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:21,550
It would be a dead end.

1061
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:23,990
And I would like to...

1062
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:26,990
Go kind of like...

1063
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,490
But four items.

1064
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:35,590
You've got two routes.

1065
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,690
I guess it's true, we do have this one going up.

1066
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,810
You know what, so true, let's get the four items.

1067
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:42,910
I'm greedy!

1068
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:47,910
Smells like old lady in here.

1069
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:51,890
Another key!

1070
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:54,850
Is that a security card?

1071
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,810
Oh, an electronic keycard opens electronically powered security doors.

1072
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:01,470
Which...

1073
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:03,710
57188...

1074
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,050
Which I turned all those off.

1075
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:06,590
We got a diamond.

1076
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:08,910
We have a purse.

1077
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:09,890
Coin purse.

1078
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:13,250
Each time you collect three, earn an additional one coin.

1079
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,370
Pretty lady.

1080
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,810
Pretty lady.

1081
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:20,550
Look at that mold.

1082
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:22,950
Money baby, money baby.

1083
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:24,950
Anything else in here?

1084
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:28,770
This guy really likes drawing.

1085
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:28,830
Drawing.

1086
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,050
Alright, let's go.

1087
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,430
That might have been lady Clara, yeah.

1088
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:42,210
Now that we have two keys.

1089
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:45,030
Courtyard.

1090
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,590
Oh my gosh, the dining room!

1091
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:48,430
Wait, what?

1092
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:49,390
Oh, I'm only rank...

1093
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:53,570
Wait, each day a meal is served in the dining room after rank 8 has been reached.

1094
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,450
I'm rank 4 currently.

1095
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:01,850
I think that would be good because you get so...

1096
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:08,090
Wait, it was like you get an additional 10 if you have the aquarium, I believe it was.

1097
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:09,830
Dining room.

1098
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,430
I'm rank 5 now!

1099
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:24,770
Okay, we're just a few away.

1100
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:27,770
We could have mega...

1101
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:34,130
Oh, and I got an extra!

1102
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,830
Fancy!

1103
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,990
Oh my gosh, I'm hungry now.

1104
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:45,230
Anybody having salmon tonight that I could possess?

1105
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:49,890
Don't you want Mito in your body?

1106
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:51,710
Controlling your every movement?

1107
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:53,910
And eating your food?

1108
01:04:58,570 --> 01:04:59,450
I wish.

1109
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:00,310
Me too.

1110
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:04,070
Not salmon, but pork.

1111
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,770
I don't know.

1112
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,250
I've only had pho once and I didn't really like it.

1113
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:10,750
Let's try going this way.

1114
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,650
Why do I lose money going into the chapel?

1115
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:26,560
Oh, all of these are kind of bad.

1116
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,120
Oh, church donation.

1117
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:32,980
How do you say that?

1118
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:36,920
Titty.

1119
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,610
You are forgiven.

1120
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:00,390
Redraw, maybe.

1121
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,430
I only have one pair of dice.

1122
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,190
I mean, not pair.

1123
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:06,330
One die.

1124
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:07,770
Singular die left.

1125
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:12,150
I don't know what you do to get more rank.

1126
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:13,350
I guess that...Oh wait.

1127
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:16,010
So it would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1128
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,510
So this is what?

1129
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:19,310
6, 7, 8.

1130
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:24,370
Wait, I should have gone up instead.

1131
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:25,130
I'm an idiot.

1132
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:30,690
No!

1133
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,830
You can do the chapel and not go in.

1134
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:35,370
You're so right.

1135
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,670
Then we at least have this option here, no?

1136
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,950
Going to church to pay the big old...

1137
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:47,210
Tie.

1138
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:53,570
Yeah, the chapel does go north and it also...Wait, no.

1139
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,010
I looked wrong.

1140
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,250
For some reason I thought it went to the right as well.

1141
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:01,390
I think that would be...Or I could just re-roll.

1142
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:02,830
I'm gonna re-roll.

1143
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,910
I feel like we can get some better options in this.

1144
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:07,550
Oh, see?

1145
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:08,770
Like the cool...

1146
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:12,770
Locksmith?

1147
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,040
Keys for sale?

1148
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:36,130
What a fun shaped room.

1149
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:36,710
I know, right?

1150
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:37,890
It looks so fascinating.

1151
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:41,340
Why is this...I don't know why this is also giving me...

1152
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:45,640
Oh my gosh, do you guys remember that book series, A Series of Unfortunate Events?

1153
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,340
It's not really at all like that, but it's kind of giving me the vibe...

1154
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,540
of it.

1155
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,580
Just like because it's a little gothic, you know?

1156
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,180
And you're just in the...I don't know.

1157
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,980
There's just something about it.

1158
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,260
All the different types of areas you can go into.

1159
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,080
Oh, the aesthetic.

1160
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:07,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1161
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,500
Like the reptile house.

1162
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:10,100
Yeah, exactly!

1163
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,860
When I look at the courtyard, I think of that.

1164
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:16,980
I think I'm gonna go with the courtyard because it's kind of our best option out of the...

1165
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,300
out of the three.

1166
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,460
But, we will go north.

1167
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,630
And we can pantry.

1168
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,290
I can't get the observatory.

1169
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,270
We shall pantry.

1170
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,240
Okay.

1171
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,900
Is that a banana?

1172
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,480
Just here?

1173
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,240
Oh my god!

1174
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,100
Lucky, lucky!

1175
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:51,860
Wow!

1176
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:54,820
Nice.

1177
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:59,440
T-t-t-t-t-the Tithi in the Roaming Chapel.

1178
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:28,080
So if I go to other pantries, I can get more food?

1179
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,460
If I unlock more pantries?

1180
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:37,970
That was our first!

1181
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:44,980
And we got plus three.

1182
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:47,180
Nooooo!

1183
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,340
Wait a second.

1184
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,140
Oh, after rank 8 has been reached.

1185
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,780
Okay, I was about to say, because we went down to rank 5...

1186
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,760
And I was like, should I have made the dining room up here?

1187
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,720
But no, it says only after it's been reached, so we're okay.

1188
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,300
We are A-okay!

1189
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,320
What is this?

1190
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,340
I got a shovel.

1191
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,240
Looks like it could be useful for digging.

1192
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:23,840
Okay!

1193
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:25,920
What do we...

1194
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,800
Like this?

1195
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,720
A turnip!

1196
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:32,900
Plus six.

1197
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,260
Oh my gosh, let's go!

1198
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:37,810
Woah.

1199
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,530
Oh my gosh, I was about to be like...

1200
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:48,030
If it's locked, we're so screwed.

1201
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,090
Conference room.

1202
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:56,290
Whenever items would be spread throughout the house, they are placed in this room instead.

1203
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:00,350
Combine inventory to create new items?

1204
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,630
Wait, but conference room seems OP, no?

1205
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:07,990
Wait, you can dig more?

1206
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:08,990
Oh, whoops.

1207
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:12,910
I think

1208
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,940
you want conference room before workshop.

1209
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:25,340
Okay.

1210
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,480
Yeah, I think so too.

1211
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,220
Getting more stuff.

1212
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,560
Where do you see another place to dig?

1213
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:35,640
Ah, I missed it!

1214
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,260
Thank you guys.

1215
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,540
Coins!

1216
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:43,420
We're so stinking rich, baby.

1217
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:57,570
This is false.

1218
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:01,310
So I'm not even gonna write it down.

1219
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:09,600
Reminder, after meeting adjourns, take all conference notes and place them in the office safe.

1220
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:14,370
Okay.

1221
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,010
Wait, what?

1222
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:21,790
Huh?

1223
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:24,270
There's no items in here.

1224
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:30,170
Wait, some special rooms allow you to spread items throughout your house.

1225
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:34,810
When items are spread, they are immediately placed in several of the rooms currently on your estate.

1226
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:38,510
However, if you have a conference room, spread items are gathered in that room instead.

1227
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:56,870
I guess I should have spread my items.

1228
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:01,170
Ah, I see.

1229
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:02,250
I think.

1230
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:04,150
I see.

1231
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:06,790
No!

1232
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:17,990
Guys, we are almost at an impasse.

1233
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:22,190
If I can get back to the entrance hall, I can go this way.

1234
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:24,750
But...

1235
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:29,400
This one is locked.

1236
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,740
This one is locked and this one is locked.

1237
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:33,800
Uh-oh.

1238
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,540
We gotta go back all the way.

1239
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:41,190
Back.

1240
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:44,430
Locksmith, please.

1241
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,470
We gotta go all the way back.

1242
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:50,550
Yeah.

1243
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:53,930
This kinda sucks.

1244
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,630
This kinda sucks.

1245
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,010
Okay.

1246
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:11,620
Getting those steps in.

1247
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:19,250
Opportunity to URD and spread.

1248
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:26,630
Combine inventory and create new items.

1249
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:33,110
I might do the workshop just so we can then get another room.

1250
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:35,670
URD and spread.

1251
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:40,560
Yes.

1252
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,060
Yes.

1253
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,520
Yeah, I don't have any gems.

1254
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:49,000
So what can I combine, baby?

1255
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,080
Is there anything else?

1256
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:51,500
Maybe a key is in here.

1257
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:54,000
I've got a lock.

1258
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:57,420
A lockpick kit!

1259
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:58,900
What?

1260
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,220
I'm gonna combine my this.

1261
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:07,280
Combine my this.

1262
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,320
Combine my this.

1263
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,540
Combine this.

1264
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:13,680
I don't think any of this makes much sense.

1265
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,720
And a wheel.

1266
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,340
What is this?

1267
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,820
The true box does not always contain the prize.

1268
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,020
Good to know.

1269
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,180
Well, we learned that from the last time we got a puzzle.

1270
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,020
Okay.

1271
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:45,140
I think we have to risk it with the closet.

1272
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,880
There was a note next to the lockpick.

1273
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:48,380
Oh, was there?

1274
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,860
There's a note on the table.

1275
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,080
Okay, I'll go check.

1276
01:15:54,220 --> 01:16:00,100
I think the closet is better than the guest bedroom.

1277
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:13,730
Stones cut blank by hand, and letters rot blank.

1278
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:18,150
Do spell blank our secrets carved from thought.

1279
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:28,090
A message is often lost among the bold blank words spoken soft.

1280
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:30,570
The note is read, the letter is not blank.

1281
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:34,190
Well, those aren't blanks.

1282
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,920
Oh, they are blanks?

1283
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,300
I meant that sheet music.

1284
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,220
Yeah?

1285
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:50,500
I've never seen it elongated like that before though.

1286
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,180
They're like sustains.

1287
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:56,560
Oh.

1288
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:04,740
Got it.

1289
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:11,130
I can't sight read anymore.

1290
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,010
So I'm not even going to attempt.

1291
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,930
Stones cut by hand and letters rot.

1292
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:19,710
Do spell our secrets carved from thought.

1293
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:25,230
A message read is often lost among the bold words spoken soft.

1294
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,050
The note is read, the letter is not.

1295
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:30,590
Okay.

1296
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:35,390
This one's number eight.

1297
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,500
How do you screenshot on Steam again?

1298
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:42,540
Again?

1299
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:50,080
How do you... how do you... how do you screen... F12?

1300
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,420
Thank you.

1301
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,080
Alright.

1302
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:55,900
E.

1303
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:08,830
E.

1304
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:11,050
E.

1305
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,550
Wait, so that was... it said eight?

1306
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:14,110
Hold on.

1307
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:17,990
Sheet... I don't know if sheet music eight...

1308
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:21,370
means anything.

1309
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:24,170
But message was bolded.

1310
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:27,910
My pen is running out.

1311
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:31,990
And then E...

1312
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:36,030
in stone.

1313
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,810
Okay.

1314
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:46,090
Alright, let's go in here and hope and pray and wish.

1315
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:50,470
What is... oh it's a lucky... lucky tail!

1316
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:51,850
Foot!

1317
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:54,310
Greater chance of finding items.

1318
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:57,210
Thank you so much for the superchat.

1319
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:01,210
Well, I wish I had that...

1320
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:05,030
I wish I had that before!

1321
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:08,930
Okey-dokey.

1322
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,480
Let's try the drawing room.

1323
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:25,660
Maybe.

1324
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,540
No... wait, hold on.

1325
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1326
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,080
1, 2, 3, 4... you know what, it's just whatever.

1327
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,500
To the pantry.

1328
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,060
Wait a second.

1329
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,160
I have a lot of money!

1330
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,160
Yeah!

1331
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,040
I have money!

1332
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:00,560
I can buy... I can buy...

1333
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,700
And morning room.

1334
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,620
Let's try that.

1335
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,920
Wait, I should have done the plus 15.

1336
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:07,220
Oh well.

1337
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,600
It's fine.

1338
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,880
I want to know what the morning room is.

1339
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,860
If we even end up getting it.

1340
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:20,420
If we can get the glazed salmon...

1341
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:22,780
Lockpick.

1342
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:26,620
No!

1343
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:27,720
No!

1344
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:28,540
Wait!

1345
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:29,720
Reroll!

1346
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:30,060
Reroll!

1347
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,000
I have no... I have no jammies!

1348
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:33,580
I don't want the lavatory!

1349
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,080
Reroll!

1350
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,790
They are fancy.

1351
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:17,730
Their family crest is also fancy.

1352
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:19,850
Anything else in here?

1353
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,220
What's good?

1354
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,900
What good is this rabbit's foot?

1355
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,040
There is nothing in here.

1356
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,960
It smells like Batara.

1357
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,500
Dirt?

1358
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,700
Oh my gosh.

1359
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,600
You guys are so... Thank you.

1360
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:42,260
Turnip!

1361
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:43,880
Thank you guys.

1362
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:44,660
Thank you, thank you.

1363
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:49,850
Okay.

1364
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:54,150
Let's try and use our lockpick on this.

1365
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:06,170
My room!

1366
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:10,490
Oh, but it... You know what?

1367
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:11,810
That's fine.

1368
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:15,530
The drawing room can... It's fine.

1369
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:18,710
This room counts as two bedrooms.

1370
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:19,330
Interesting.

1371
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:23,230
Less likely to find items lying around in your house.

1372
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,110
Wait, that's not good.

1373
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,030
We don't want... Wait.

1374
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:33,710
Oh no!

1375
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,410
Yeah, that's bad.

1376
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:38,170
What is the only choice we've got?

1377
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:39,410
You know what?

1378
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:45,590
This run is over anyway.

1379
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:47,050
What do you mean it's not over?

1380
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:52,350
I still have... I still have... I'm still here!

1381
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:55,290
I'm still here, no?

1382
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:57,310
Woah, my family.

1383
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,150
This guy looks spooky.

1384
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,170
Eight people.

1385
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:35,410
Any staff who have an interest in attending services may contact Mrs. Babbage for details.

1386
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:41,330
In following the instructions left by the Baron himself, effective immediately, all work at Mount Holly is suspended.

1387
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:49,750
All live-in staff will have one month paid leave and must vacate the premises by Friday, November 6th.

1388
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:50,990
Mrs. Babbage.

1389
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,350
Okay, that's why nobody's here.

1390
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,740
This game is so eerie.

1391
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,780
This game is so creepy.

1392
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,200
This is the ugliest maid uniform.

1393
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,100
What actually is going on here?

1394
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,620
This is the worst maid uniform I've ever seen in my entire afterlife.

1395
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,060
What is happening?

1396
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,480
What did Picasso make this?

1397
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:20,220
Terrible.

1398
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,360
Repulsive.

1399
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,200
The worst I've ever seen.

1400
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:36,060
Damn the person who said this run was dead.

1401
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,040
Damn you!

1402
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,420
Damn you!

1403
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,400
The run is over.

1404
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,160
You know what?

1405
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:05,000
I never got to have my salmon.

1406
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:08,080
I never got to have it.

1407
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,560
It smells so good.

1408
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:15,680
I'm not gonna...

1409
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,940
I'm just gonna run out of...

1410
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:19,980
That scared me.

1411
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:20,880
I thought it was a mannequin.

1412
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,160
Wait, we have a pet?

1413
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,400
Is there a cat here?

1414
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,860
Looking for dirt?

1415
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:30,560
You know what?

1416
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:32,060
That's a good idea too.

1417
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,680
Let's search for dirt.

1418
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:38,300
It could be dirt that we completely... Wait, let's go outside.

1419
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,040
There

1420
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,060
might be dirt out here.

1421
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:50,830
Wait, can I just leave?

1422
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:54,750
Wait...

1423
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:58,510
Wait...

1424
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:00,450
Wow!

1425
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:23,950
Who is...

1426
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:24,730
The campsite.

1427
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:30,450
Due to the rules set forth in your great uncle's will, you are not allowed to stay in the estate overnight.

1428
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:36,410
Luckily, however, your scouting skills have been put to good use to fabricate a very respectable off-site sleeping quarters.

1429
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:52,810
Interesting.

1430
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,070
What is he making there?

1431
01:26:57,190 --> 01:26:57,370
Cider?

1432
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:07,430
I'm gonna do it.

1433
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:08,670
Sorry, Gramps.

1434
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:16,690
What else we got?

1435
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:17,990
There was something over here too.

1436
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:20,250
What the?

1437
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:22,510
Um...

1438
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:25,270
Okay.

1439
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,690
Gramps was ready for doomsday.

1440
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:30,030
Understandable.

1441
01:27:31,070 --> 01:27:31,870
Don't do it.

1442
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:33,070
I'm gonna do it.

1443
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,190
What if we just found a key out here?

1444
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:38,630
Wouldn't that be just... so... special?

1445
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,790
Wait, is there a front door mat?

1446
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:45,490
Grandpa...

1447
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,240
What's down there?

1448
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,840
Wait a second.

1449
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,220
There's so much around here.

1450
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,640
I'm gonna lose my jammies.

1451
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:00,620
Am I?

1452
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:01,500
I wonder.

1453
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:04,020
Make a wish?

1454
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:04,580
Wait.

1455
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:06,700
Oh, it's a bird.

1456
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:08,880
I can make a wish.

1457
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:10,620
I wish for a key.

1458
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:21,610
Grandpa...

1459
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:24,410
If you can hear me...

1460
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:27,490
I wish for a key.

1461
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:30,030
I'm not asking for much.

1462
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:31,070
All I need is one.

1463
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:38,410
Is this also locked or...

1464
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:40,190
Just jump, buddy.

1465
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:43,690
Just jump.

1466
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:46,410
It doesn't seem as locked for some reason though.

1467
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:47,150
I won't budge.

1468
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:50,170
Like it's not saying that I need a key for it.

1469
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:53,390
Ah...

1470
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:59,230
Oh wait, there's down here too.

1471
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,710
Woah!

1472
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:06,610
Woah!

1473
01:29:07,310 --> 01:29:10,830
Oh my gosh, remember I said, Grandpa, what mind do you have?

1474
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:18,570
What is up with that mountain?

1475
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:20,070
It's kinda freaky.

1476
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:23,450
What?

1477
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:24,110
What?

1478
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:26,010
Hole?

1479
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:27,190
Wait.

1480
01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:28,070
Wait.

1481
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:32,030
We have an underground society?

1482
01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:42,010
I think this game is a little more complex than I first imagined it to be.

1483
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:44,490
Wait, what if we find a key in here?

1484
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:45,310
Wait.

1485
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:49,250
Oh, this is really scary.

1486
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:52,630
And I don't have a lighter.

1487
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,320
This is kinda freaky.

1488
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:58,500
Let's get out of here.

1489
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,000
Can I go in there?

1490
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:01,300
No.

1491
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:07,120
Okay.

1492
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:10,560
I'm just gonna run out of steps.

1493
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,120
A haunted mansion episode of Over the Garden Wall?

1494
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:15,640
Yes!

1495
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:18,700
Yeah, it reminds me of that too.

1496
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Where they just kept building and building.

1497
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,740
It's so much like that.

1498
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,620
Oh, well good.

1499
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:27,300
We at least got to explore some.

1500
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,500
Grandpa liked birds.

1501
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:33,040
We at least got to explore a little bit.

1502
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,220
That's always nice.

1503
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,700
That's always good to do.

1504
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,080
Oh shoot, I just gained more.

1505
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:51,720
Wait, I just noticed these.

1506
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:52,540
What are those?

1507
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:56,180
Wait.

1508
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,680
Are these the little sparkles you get from the observatory?

1509
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:04,660
Perhaps.

1510
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:06,720
Twinkle dogs.

1511
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:10,360
Maybe?

1512
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,460
Oh man, I should have been...

1513
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:18,260
Every time that I got an observatory though, it wasn't the right time.

1514
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,500
Ah, I see, I see, I see.

1515
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,980
Hot queen of diamonds.

1516
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,020
I'll see you again soon.

1517
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:30,120
Maybe.

1518
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,260
Let's see if there's any more dirt to...

1519
01:31:36,230 --> 01:31:37,230
Oh, this too!

1520
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:41,090
Well, I wouldn't waste my key on it.

1521
01:31:42,770 --> 01:31:43,330
But...

1522
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:45,290
Any dirt in the security room?

1523
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:49,510
What does that say?

1524
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:51,450
Oh, B cam, A cam.

1525
01:31:57,410 --> 01:32:00,150
We got six rooms left, guys.

1526
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:03,390
What was it?

1527
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,520
Five.

1528
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,680
Four.

1529
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:11,580
Three.

1530
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:13,500
Two.

1531
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,280
One.

1532
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:18,980
Zero.

1533
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,120
Wow.

1534
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,280
Do I get to keep my gemmies?

1535
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:43,900
Because I earned those, I feel.

1536
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,040
Mount Holly.

1537
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:48,320
Mid-sized villa.

1538
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:53,740
Total rooms 24, rank reach 6, steps taken 86, items found 7.

1539
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:58,440
I feel like we were so close.

1540
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,560
Save and continue, of course.

1541
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:05,700
Yeah, mid-sized says who?

1542
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:10,060
Says who?

1543
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,000
Yeah, we did learn a lot.

1544
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,060
This game is so cool.

1545
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,240
This game is so cool.

1546
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,540
Good morning, Minto!

1547
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:26,300
Alrighty!

1548
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:31,760
She's here!

1549
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:33,840
Wait, are the flowers different?

1550
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:36,180
Or were they these flowers before?

1551
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:36,320
Four.

1552
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,580
Let's go forward!

1553
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,760
Wait, this bedroom actually has a...

1554
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:07,880
Good start.

1555
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:10,940
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.

1556
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,680
Straight into the lavatory.

1557
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:17,840
I haven't unlocked a lavatory before.

1558
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:19,720
Let's do the bedroom.

1559
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,520
Just like before.

1560
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:29,220
Wow, wait, it's the same exact bedroom.

1561
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:30,880
Oh, this is so trippy.

1562
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,040
This is so trippy.

1563
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:37,340
Oh, but...

1564
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:39,040
Oh my gosh.

1565
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:45,050
The storeroom might be nice.

1566
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:48,870
Oh wait, the nook would be good too.

1567
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:50,370
Let's do that.

1568
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,960
Oh my gosh, I feel like I'm going to get lost.

1569
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:01,300
Because I'm not going to remember.

1570
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:08,030
Oh, this one too!

1571
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:11,150
This too has four stars.

1572
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:13,210
Interesting, okay.

1573
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:18,450
So if I get four observatories, maybe we try coming back here.

1574
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:20,550
Lost in the sauce.

1575
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:21,350
I know.

1576
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:25,250
No, wait, can I go into debt in this game?

1577
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:28,390
Let's try it.

1578
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:29,670
Can I go into debt?

1579
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:34,190
I can't!

1580
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:35,910
Oh, yippee!

1581
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,630
One.

1582
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:44,910
There's no two.

1583
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,100
Oh, there it is.

1584
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,780
The pantry.

1585
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:01,980
The chef is two.

1586
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,240
Three is the farmer.

1587
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,900
Four is the chimney sweep.

1588
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,460
Five is the maid.

1589
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,080
Six is...

1590
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:20,840
What is that?

1591
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:21,600
Like a horse?

1592
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,380
I'm not quite sure.

1593
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,880
What are they?

1594
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:31,390
A jockey?

1595
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:34,910
Chicken jockey!

1596
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:43,980
Partner's birthday was yesterday and you're his Kamiyoshi.

1597
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,660
Can I get a happy birthday for NEP?

1598
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,780
Of course!

1599
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,360
NEP, happy birthday!

1600
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:53,340
Happy birthday to you.

1601
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:56,300
Happy birthday to you.

1602
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:59,460
Happy birthday dear NEP.

1603
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:04,260
Happy birthday to you.

1604
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:06,980
Happy birthday!

1605
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,160
Seven.

1606
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,180
Wait a second.

1607
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:22,780
Are these

1608
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:30,440
things that unlock when you get to that rank?

1609
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:36,680
Because I feel like we unlocked the... I feel like it was about rank five, no?

1610
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:38,840
That we unlocked the maid quarters.

1611
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:44,540
And...

1612
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,040
Two.

1613
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:51,950
Makes sense, yeah?

1614
01:37:52,810 --> 01:37:55,090
You can read room descriptions by clicking on them.

1615
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:57,470
Oh, neat.

1616
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:02,230
Oh!

1617
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:14,040
Bedrooms, hallways, green rooms, shops, red rooms.

1618
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:18,640
So red rooms are not good to have because they...

1619
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,080
Red rooms are bad.

1620
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,400
We want to get less of those.

1621
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:27,980
Let's try going this way.

1622
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:29,420
Yeah.

1623
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:35,860
Ow.

1624
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:39,860
I guess the den would be our best bet here.

1625
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:44,500
Red room, red room.

1626
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:57,630
Spare bedroom.

1627
01:38:58,590 --> 01:38:59,390
Drawing room.

1628
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:00,690
Why is nothing going up?

1629
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:02,410
Sucks.

1630
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:04,230
Let's go spare.

1631
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:06,350
I suppose.

1632
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:08,210
Oh wait!

1633
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:09,850
I just realized I got the gem.

1634
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:10,730
I'm such an idiot.

1635
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:11,510
No!

1636
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:12,430
I forgot.

1637
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:15,030
Let's try this one.

1638
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,940
Oh, the security room.

1639
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,240
Already.

1640
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,360
And west...

1641
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,920
View inventory... Oh wait.

1642
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:31,900
And of all items... Oh, I didn't realize.

1643
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:32,940
Okay, hold on.

1644
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:37,040
Hold on.

1645
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:38,760
View the items.

1646
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,080
How do I see that?

1647
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:42,220
Oh wait, this...

1648
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:44,860
What's that?

1649
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:51,490
How do you see the items?

1650
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:52,750
Am I stupid?

1651
01:39:58,650 --> 01:39:59,170
Enter.

1652
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:04,490
I didn't notice this was a thing.

1653
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:08,790
The following is a detailed list of items currently in the house that have yet to be collected.

1654
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:10,930
This list will be updated as new rooms are added.

1655
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:12,230
Okay.

1656
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:14,850
Main menu.

1657
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:16,230
Keycard system.

1658
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:18,550
Security doors are open within...

1659
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:20,450
The estate...

1660
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:21,470
Wait.

1661
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:26,770
You got any games on this thing?

1662
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:28,550
We got Snake on here.

1663
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:33,470
The keycard system is currently operational.

1664
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:35,230
Keycard system settings.

1665
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:37,310
Set security level...

1666
01:40:38,850 --> 01:40:39,650
To...

1667
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:40,130
Low.

1668
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:40,530
Wait.

1669
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:44,530
Security level determines the amount of keycard security doors that will be deployed in your estate.

1670
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:47,290
Example, you should expect to see one or two security doors with a low setting.

1671
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:49,410
Five to six with a high setting.

1672
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:52,530
I imagine though that...

1673
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,710
Let's just keep it as is.

1674
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:58,810
Because if we can get another security... We had the keycard before.

1675
01:40:59,610 --> 01:41:01,590
If we can get another one, we'll be Gucci.

1676
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:04,150
But...

1677
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:07,710
I imagine better things are behind...

1678
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:09,950
The security doors.

1679
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:10,270
No?

1680
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:12,990
So...

1681
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:14,690
Change offline mode.

1682
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:22,190
As a general rule of safety, offline should be set to unlocked if any staff are working on the estate.

1683
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:27,990
This mode determines the default setting to security doors will be set to if power is lost.

1684
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:31,230
During a blackout, for example.

1685
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:34,790
Unlocked.

1686
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:36,970
I think there's no harm in doing that.

1687
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:45,110
Yeah, you can raise it back once you get the keycard.

1688
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:45,430
You know what?

1689
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:45,790
That's true.

1690
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:50,310
I mean, we'd have to come all the way back here, but...

1691
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:53,570
Wow.

1692
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:55,930
Thank you.

1693
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:56,810
I did not notice.

1694
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:03,220
The security door is locked by an electronic keycard.

1695
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:04,900
Oh.

1696
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:05,280
Already?

1697
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:05,340
Already?

1698
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:08,220
Oh!

1699
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:14,060
Oh, there was a raid!

1700
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:14,600
Hello!

1701
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:15,820
Thank you!

1702
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:19,240
Sorry, I didn't see who raided me, but thank you!

1703
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:20,940
Hello, hello!

1704
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:22,740
Thank you so much for the raid!

1705
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,540
This game is a roguelike puzzle game.

1706
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:31,680
Where you explore a house.

1707
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,680
I'm selling it, probably.

1708
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:34,740
Wait a second.

1709
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:34,780
Wait a second.

1710
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,080
Okay, the spare room might be our only hope.

1711
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,860
You're our only hope.

1712
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:45,740
Corridor.

1713
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:52,420
So pretty.

1714
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:59,780
I do also want to unlock more different types of rooms, so I'm fine with trying some other things out, you know?

1715
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,300
Oh, we can do the... Oh!

1716
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,080
The parlor!

1717
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,120
Okay!

1718
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:17,700
Okay, one box will only display true.

1719
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:18,920
At least one will be true.

1720
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,520
At least one will be false.

1721
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:23,120
And there will be one prize, okay?

1722
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:24,740
Same as before.

1723
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,340
Let's go, baby!

1724
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:29,800
What do we got?

1725
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,740
This box is the white box.

1726
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:36,460
I don't think that's right.

1727
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:41,600
Dwarko, thank you so much for the 10 gilded.

1728
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,920
This box is the black box.

1729
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:48,900
This, the blue box, contains the gems.

1730
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:20,840
Today is my brother, Mediocre Monk's birthday.

1731
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:21,860
Could you sing happy birthday?

1732
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,200
Thank you, Fiddy!

1733
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:23,980
Thank you!

1734
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,500
Thank you for the super chat!

1735
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,240
Of course I can sing.

1736
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:29,300
Dear brother, happy birthday!

1737
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:31,820
This is the orange box.

1738
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:37,020
Happy birthday to you!

1739
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:40,060
Happy birthday to you!

1740
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:44,720
Happy birthday, Mediocre Monk!

1741
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,140
You're not so mediocre!

1742
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:50,440
Happy birthday to you!

1743
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,800
Happy birthday!

1744
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,800
Let's make our little...

1745
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:01,770
Oh wait.

1746
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:02,990
Oh no.

1747
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:06,450
Oh, well, we can do the breaker then.

1748
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:08,830
I think that would be good to have that available.

1749
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:14,630
Keycard off.

1750
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:18,750
Dark room.

1751
01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:23,010
And we still didn't learn what this is before either.

1752
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:37,790
So far we haven't gone super far, but...

1753
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:42,510
Wait, why is it so dark?

1754
01:45:44,710 --> 01:45:45,690
Where are we at?

1755
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:46,270
A closet?

1756
01:45:47,230 --> 01:45:48,810
West wing hall I think would be best.

1757
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:51,010
Trying to go up is...

1758
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:53,670
Now set security doors to high.

1759
01:45:59,010 --> 01:45:59,570
Neat.

1760
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:03,170
Okay, so that worked perfectly.

1761
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:05,850
Keycard system.

1762
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:08,610
System settings.

1763
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:12,890
Set security level to high.

1764
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:13,830
Confirm.

1765
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:17,790
Thanks for reminding me guys.

1766
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:19,870
Perfect, perfect.

1767
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:22,330
All according to Minky.

1768
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:27,710
My queen!

1769
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:33,070
Hmm...

1770
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:37,070
I'm just going to keep trying to go north.

1771
01:46:37,810 --> 01:46:39,550
Oh, well...

1772
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:40,210
Hold on.

1773
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:41,250
Is this one locked?

1774
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:45,630
Mug!

1775
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:49,070
Welcome to Batboy's ship.

1776
01:46:51,710 --> 01:46:54,470
Wow, this one is kind of fancy.

1777
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:56,910
Wait, but the pantry...

1778
01:46:58,650 --> 01:46:59,890
Pantry goes up.

1779
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:06,840
Marvelous monk.

1780
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,840
What would you guys say?

1781
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:12,680
The passageway requires...

1782
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:16,500
You know what pantries give you.

1783
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:16,880
True.

1784
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:19,260
Save your gems?

1785
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:19,660
Okay.

1786
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:23,380
I feel like using the passageway there is kind of a waste anyway, no?

1787
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:27,260
Okay, we got one apple.

1788
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:29,380
And more money.

1789
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,660
Unfortunately, if I want to go back to the spare room though, I have to give up some money for the chapel.

1790
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:42,860
But, so far we are doing alright.

1791
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,440
So far.

1792
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:49,320
The courtyard is pretty good.

1793
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:53,060
Oh, that might actually...

1794
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:54,480
Yes.

1795
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,540
And that will put us at...

1796
01:47:59,060 --> 01:47:59,940
I've read the note.

1797
01:48:01,540 --> 01:48:03,100
I'm pretty sure it's the same as before.

1798
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,000
Saying that there's like...

1799
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Yeah, five apples, five bananas, five oranges.

1800
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:11,940
So if we get more pantries unlocked, then we will...

1801
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:15,880
Oh, we don't get a shovel this time.

1802
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:19,540
We get a sledgehammer.

1803
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:23,640
Can shatter padlocks on locked trunks.

1804
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:25,780
Okay.

1805
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:28,840
I don't think we've seen a locked trunk though.

1806
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:30,300
I kind of wanted the shovel.

1807
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:31,880
Oh, sorry.

1808
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:32,480
No, no, no.

1809
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:33,040
We're all good.

1810
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:34,920
We might have not been here.

1811
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:35,420
It's all good.

1812
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:41,580
I guess that's kind of the interesting thing about this roguelike is some of the notes...

1813
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:45,300
I guess the further we get beyond, we will get more new stuff.

1814
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:46,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1815
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:49,700
I wish it would work.

1816
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:53,620
I was thinking the sledgehammer maybe would work on locked doors.

1817
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,100
Sadly, no.

1818
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:01,140
Hmm.

1819
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:10,640
Patio.

1820
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:13,560
Spread gems in each green room.

1821
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:15,040
Which I only have one.

1822
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:16,780
A garage.

1823
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:20,760
Or we can do a guest bedroom and get ten more stuppies.

1824
01:49:22,660 --> 01:49:24,380
You need an axe like the Shining.

1825
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:26,720
Here's Mickey.

1826
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,500
Oh, the garage gives you more keys.

1827
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:31,280
Oh my gosh.

1828
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:35,060
Garage is in the breaker room.

1829
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:35,480
Yes.

1830
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:36,500
Did I turn it on?

1831
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,440
Three keys is huge.

1832
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,180
I'm not going to lie.

1833
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:43,280
I did turn it on.

1834
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:43,940
Yay.

1835
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:46,560
I'm so smart.

1836
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:49,280
What is this?

1837
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:51,720
Oh.

1838
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:07,400
Oh.

1839
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:10,160
Oh.

1840
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:11,520
Wait.

1841
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:19,300
Christoph, this is the third time this month you and the car have been gone when your services were required.

1842
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:23,960
I don't care how long you have been driving for his lordship.

1843
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:25,580
His lordship.

1844
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:28,440
Your absences must be accounted for.

1845
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:29,820
Mrs. Babbage.

1846
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,720
The music in this game is so nice.

1847
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:38,520
Oh my gosh.

1848
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:41,540
The music in this game is so nice.

1849
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,420
Dobby is a free elf.

1850
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:08,360
And look.

1851
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,440
We made it past.

1852
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,500
This is the run everybody.

1853
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:20,060
Oh.

1854
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:28,460
Shelter protects you from the negative effects of the next three red rooms drafted.

1855
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:33,300
Rooms in your house will be more likely to contain dig spots today.

1856
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:35,040
Or tool shed.

1857
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:42,500
I don't feel like... I mean, I don't have a shovel so...

1858
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:46,320
This is freaking me out.

1859
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,000
Yeah, the radiation.

1860
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:53,890
The shed.

1861
01:51:56,830 --> 01:51:59,890
I'm curious what red...

1862
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:05,330
So the bathroom is... I'm sorry, the lavatory is a red room but like...

1863
01:52:05,330 --> 01:52:06,730
What's bad about it?

1864
01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:09,070
I guess it doesn't give you any...

1865
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:12,210
Any... anything?

1866
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:17,670
Chapel is red too.

1867
01:52:17,870 --> 01:52:18,070
Yeah.

1868
01:52:18,070 --> 01:52:21,210
The chapel, you lose one coin.

1869
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:26,390
Let's go tool shed.

1870
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:27,370
I'm thinking the same thing.

1871
01:52:28,110 --> 01:52:31,510
Because it wouldn't affect the... It says the next three drafted.

1872
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:35,290
And so, it would not apply, unfortunately.

1873
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:38,290
So let's do... I'm so curious.

1874
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:39,930
Look at the stairs and it goes down.

1875
01:52:40,370 --> 01:52:42,950
Let's do the tool shed for practicality, I believe.

1876
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:47,070
Oh yeah, the maid room too.

1877
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:52,150
We got ourselves a shovel!

1878
01:52:53,490 --> 01:52:54,030
Let's see.

1879
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:55,810
I figured that would happen.

1880
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:58,990
And a metal detector.

1881
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:01,610
Greater chance of finding keys and money!

1882
01:53:03,790 --> 01:53:05,290
Nice, and what's our third thing?

1883
01:53:06,190 --> 01:53:07,330
What's our third thing?

1884
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:09,050
It said three items, no?

1885
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:11,550
Wait, what's our... What's the third?

1886
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:12,330
Hello?

1887
01:53:13,210 --> 01:53:13,610
Wait.

1888
01:53:14,430 --> 01:53:15,990
Did it say three special items?

1889
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:17,130
Oh, just two.

1890
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:18,410
OK, I can't read.

1891
01:53:20,230 --> 01:53:22,810
Good find though, I'd say.

1892
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:25,370
I love this music.

1893
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:32,440
I wonder if the OST is on Steam.

1894
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:39,170
Oh, the gate.

1895
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:40,410
Thank you.

1896
01:53:53,950 --> 01:53:58,090
The west gate has been permanently unlocked!

1897
01:53:58,930 --> 01:54:00,470
That's huge!

1898
01:54:00,990 --> 01:54:03,150
Oh my gosh, that's huge!

1899
01:54:05,470 --> 01:54:05,970
Nice.

1900
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:12,120
So it kind of pays.

1901
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:17,120
I guess because we were on the west wing wall, we were able to unlock the garage.

1902
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:20,180
And it kind of led us out into this area.

1903
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:23,120
So, so cool.

1904
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:25,180
And then what's over here?

1905
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:33,290
So I wonder if we can unlock stuff on the east wing then.

1906
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:40,460
Very cool.

1907
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,080
And we can dig here.

1908
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:47,200
Dig, dig, dig.

1909
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:49,060
Turn up!

1910
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:50,440
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

1911
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:52,240
Hammer the trunk?

1912
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:53,140
Wait, did I miss a trunk?

1913
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:53,820
Wait.

1914
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,280
I don't think...

1915
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:58,820
It wouldn't let me... Oh wait!

1916
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:01,460
No, I... Wait, I think I just messed up.

1917
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,420
Because this one, it didn't give me an option to.

1918
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:07,040
Sorry, I already had the hammer at that point.

1919
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,080
Sorry, I messed up.

1920
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,180
I shouldn't have...

1921
01:55:09,180 --> 01:55:09,400
Ah!

1922
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:10,420
It's fine.

1923
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:11,800
It's fine.

1924
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:17,540
I'm gonna play this game more now.

1925
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:18,240
Have fun!

1926
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:21,700
Okay, anyway.

1927
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:22,580
It's fine.

1928
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:23,860
It's fine.

1929
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:26,480
I just lost a couple steps, but it's fine.

1930
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:32,200
Yeah, see?

1931
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:35,060
The lavatory doesn't... Maybe because it doesn't give you anything.

1932
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:36,940
But also this hallway!

1933
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,940
I do not have any gems, so I can't unlock the kitchen anyway, but this hallway is a pretty good...

1934
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:45,000
...other dig spot.

1935
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,360
Thank you, gaze.

1936
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:49,720
Thank you.

1937
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:52,580
More cards!

1938
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,900
Minto, while writing finals papers.

1939
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:56,760
Three pages left.

1940
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,840
Oh, Envero, you got this!

1941
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,200
You've got this, you've got this.

1942
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:06,640
Oh, my metal detector.

1943
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,720
Doors in the west... Okay, that's false.

1944
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:12,700
Most likely.

1945
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,060
Oh, my god!

1946
01:56:23,780 --> 01:56:24,980
It worked!

1947
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:29,560
Hey, I always forget that spot.

1948
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:31,480
My bad.

1949
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:33,240
Okay, drawing room.

1950
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:36,280
I don't... I can't... I can't... I can't afford it.

1951
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:37,320
No!

1952
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:42,720
And once you have drawn floor plans, you must select one.

1953
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:47,960
Maybe I should have gone to the right.

1954
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:53,840
I'm gonna do the guest bedroom.

1955
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:58,020
So that we can get ten more steps.

1956
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:02,920
I think so.

1957
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:05,880
I think right now...

1958
01:57:06,580 --> 01:57:11,300
Also, I haven't crafted this room before, so...

1959
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:15,880
I cheated you!

1960
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:19,720
So we can get new notes and stuff too.

1961
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:29,200
Sinclair, just wanted to write you a quick note thanking you for the weekend.

1962
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:37,440
I had a thrilling time on the hunt with Lord Evanson, whose peculiar personality somewhat made up for your own absence.

1963
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:42,160
I also got to appreciate your new game in the billiard room.

1964
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:45,000
It's been ages since I've seen the billiard room in the house.

1965
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:48,340
I was beginning to suspect you retired the floor plan.

1966
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:51,180
Is everyone just okay with the house being like this?

1967
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:52,440
Is this just like a...

1968
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:58,900
Is this just how everyone's like, yep, this is just the house.

1969
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:11,320
It was well worth the wait though, as I always enjoyed your mathematical puzzles and appreciated that I didn't need to know the rules of darts to play your variation.

1970
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:16,310
Okay, interesting.

1971
01:58:16,690 --> 01:58:18,610
So we have a dart puzzle perhaps, maybe.

1972
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:21,550
Hoping your health improves shortly.

1973
01:58:22,690 --> 01:58:23,250
KL?

1974
01:58:24,710 --> 01:58:25,670
Is that what that says?

1975
01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:30,670
Everyone's just fine with all of this happening.

1976
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:34,990
Aww, little pup.

1977
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:43,300
Okay, well that was kind of stinky, but...

1978
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:47,060
We can maybe save this.

1979
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:50,980
I

1980
01:59:01,090 --> 01:59:03,110
think I'm gonna go for the kitchen.

1981
01:59:16,370 --> 01:59:18,350
We still have one more.

1982
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:22,410
We still have this too.

1983
01:59:23,010 --> 01:59:24,570
And the spare room.

1984
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:26,410
And the entrance hall, I don't know.

1985
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:27,210
Do we have a couple?

1986
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:30,670
The food!

1987
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:34,250
Wait, the food here has not been eaten yet!

1988
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:36,090
And the water!

1989
01:59:36,350 --> 01:59:37,950
It was eaten in the last one.

1990
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:43,690
We have... we have a mice problem.

1991
01:59:44,690 --> 01:59:44,890
Maybe.

1992
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:47,830
What's today?

1993
01:59:48,170 --> 01:59:49,750
Porter House Steak!

1994
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:54,530
A delightfully expensive steak cut.

1995
01:59:56,110 --> 02:00:00,450
Bone-in and extra marbled for maximum tenderness.

1996
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:03,670
A perfect dish for those who love extravagance.

1997
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:05,590
You know what I had today?

1998
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,830
Popcorn chicken.

1999
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:15,150
Yeah, chef salad for every green room.

2000
02:00:15,690 --> 02:00:17,270
I think I only have one, no?

2001
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:21,170
Just one.

2002
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:26,990
Club sandwich, plus 15.

2003
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:28,910
Banana!

2004
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:32,770
I don't think I need it right now though.

2005
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:37,440
Ah!

2006
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:42,560
I kind of want to finish my... I didn't finish my popcorn chicken.

2007
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:45,800
What should we do?

2008
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,620
I do still have three keys left.

2009
02:01:02,300 --> 02:01:02,940
Use it?

2010
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:03,540
Yeah.

2011
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:04,980
Use.

2012
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:09,740
I was wondering if I should go all the way to the other place, but...

2013
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:12,960
Ah, commissary.

2014
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:13,600
No!

2015
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:17,420
I don't have a gem anymore.

2016
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:31,460
Okay, let's just hope for some good items.

2017
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:35,860
I haven't unlocked the bunk bedroom either before, so...

2018
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:37,700
We're unlocking new stuff at least.

2019
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:39,600
Oh my god!

2020
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:42,220
A gerbil!

2021
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:45,020
Oh, he's so cute!

2022
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:46,500
Oh my god, he's so cute!

2023
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:49,100
Wait, who's feeding you?

2024
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:51,040
I'm scared.

2025
02:01:56,830 --> 02:01:57,850
Is there more?

2026
02:01:59,430 --> 02:02:00,390
More money.

2027
02:02:02,870 --> 02:02:04,090
Okay, that's everything.

2028
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:06,570
No keys in this room?

2029
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:10,830
The turtles of Vera.

2030
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:15,330
Who is feeding you?

2031
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:19,450
Oh my gosh, what if you have to feed your gerbil and you can't find your room?

2032
02:02:22,570 --> 02:02:23,950
No key, no key.

2033
02:02:25,710 --> 02:02:30,330
Today is a good day because Simon is at camp and he is not as much fun as my friends.

2034
02:02:32,110 --> 02:02:36,730
I will not have to share my toys and will not have to share my room and I will not have to share my snacks.

2035
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:39,790
Having a younger brother is not as much fun as they told me it would be.

2036
02:02:40,050 --> 02:02:42,350
But today will be a good day because he is at camp.

2037
02:02:44,230 --> 02:02:44,750
Gerbil!

2038
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:46,090
Oh sorry, not gerbil.

2039
02:02:48,650 --> 02:02:53,850
Herbie is mean and really stupid and today is a good day because I threw away his airplane.

2040
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:05,890
P.S.

2041
02:03:05,890 --> 02:03:08,210
I wrote this in Herbie's blood, right?

2042
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:14,070
I also had more fun at camp than he has had in his entire life.

2043
02:03:16,990 --> 02:03:23,750
Today is a good day because I got my brother in trouble for reading my private journal without my permission and writing mean things in it too.

2044
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:32,370
Also he threw my model airplane in the bushes outside but I got it back and if he does it again he will not get to go to the park on Friday and I...

2045
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:37,090
Oh wait, and yeah, I will make sure he gets no presents for his birthday.

2046
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:39,770
They told him he wanted a brother.

2047
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:41,190
They lied.

2048
02:03:44,470 --> 02:03:50,670
I don't need any presents because I have my brother's book because he won't stop writing about me.

2049
02:03:50,770 --> 02:03:56,070
And today is a good day because I know he cries when he can't find his book even though he is older.

2050
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:57,810
He is a crybaby.

2051
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:00,350
Oh.

2052
02:04:01,290 --> 02:04:10,790
Today is a good day because today my brother returns from college and I get to finally return to him the book I took from him a long, long time ago.

2053
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:13,990
Hopefully you will find it as hilarious as I do.

2054
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:17,210
I honestly have no idea how we survived sharing a room.

2055
02:04:18,430 --> 02:04:24,030
All things being said, I still would rather have had a sister.

2056
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:28,610
Congrats on the diploma and welcome home, Simon.

2057
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:36,270
That's so sweet.

2058
02:04:37,610 --> 02:04:38,870
So cute.

2059
02:04:43,090 --> 02:04:45,450
Oh my god, please run.

2060
02:04:46,810 --> 02:04:48,350
Yeah, look at him.

2061
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:52,880
Wow, he is going really fast.

2062
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:53,660
Oh my god.

2063
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:55,120
Herbal.

2064
02:04:55,120 --> 02:04:59,640
My brother is calling me Herbie.

2065
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:00,820
Wait, what?

2066
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:04,680
And says all of this is really relatable.

2067
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:05,620
Should I be afraid?

2068
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,440
And why can't I find my paper airplane?

2069
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:17,150
Camp Colonel.

2070
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:24,540
The Trinsdale Mystery.

2071
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,340
They got games in their room.

2072
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,820
All we got was money though.

2073
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,860
I guess we can buy some stuff.

2074
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:37,320
Like we can buy some food.

2075
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:41,560
I could get the club sandwich.

2076
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:45,260
For some more steps.

2077
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:49,480
I guess it's worth it for now.

2078
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:53,420
Especially because this run is looking a little tough.

2079
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:57,380
I have to go back through the chapel.

2080
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:08,280
Wait, if I go into this, do I get plus ten every time?

2081
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:10,540
Or is it just the first time I go in?

2082
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:14,780
Oh, I can go outside.

2083
02:06:14,860 --> 02:06:15,300
You're right.

2084
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:16,740
Take the garage.

2085
02:06:16,840 --> 02:06:17,580
You're right, you're right.

2086
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:19,120
Just the first time.

2087
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:24,060
Wouldn't it be cool?

2088
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:26,960
I thought that maybe because he talked about...

2089
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:31,400
The plane being in the bushes.

2090
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:34,320
If maybe when we went out here we could find it.

2091
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:43,540
I thought I saw a coin.

2092
02:06:46,780 --> 02:06:47,300
Nice.

2093
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:51,560
Okay.

2094
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:53,980
To the spare room.

2095
02:06:55,700 --> 02:06:58,320
Wait, how do we... Oh, I do have to still go...

2096
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:58,480
What?

2097
02:06:58,720 --> 02:06:58,960
No.

2098
02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:03,160
I'm going to go to the right of the entrance hall instead.

2099
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:05,000
Make a wish.

2100
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:15,020
I wish that we can go around.

2101
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:22,200
We have to get insane luck here.

2102
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:24,100
Okay, drawing.

2103
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:28,580
Don't have any gems.

2104
02:07:47,490 --> 02:07:49,950
Old Clannad art toggle win.

2105
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:52,490
It's not even Clannad!

2106
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:56,850
This is not even Clannad!

2107
02:07:59,670 --> 02:08:01,770
Okay, to the spare room.

2108
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:03,310
Our only hope.

2109
02:08:04,370 --> 02:08:06,950
You're our only hope, spare room Kenobi.

2110
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:26,880
The runner is dead.

2111
02:08:31,940 --> 02:08:33,360
The runner is dead!

2112
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:42,960
We can craft some new rooms that we have not done before.

2113
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:48,080
I guess the boudoir sounds kind of fancy.

2114
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,120
We can at least go to other places.

2115
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:54,800
I have no idea what's going on, but Minkikyu...

2116
02:08:55,740 --> 02:08:56,300
Basically...

2117
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:59,720
Trying to go up here, but we're in a roguelike.

2118
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:03,680
She took off her shoes.

2119
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:06,240
Is there really nothing in here?

2120
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:08,200
Wait, what's this?

2121
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:10,620
Christmas!

2122
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:12,880
Interesting.

2123
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:16,220
Okay, someone got a safe for Christmas.

2124
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:18,740
Interesting, interesting.

2125
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:24,380
Why are there so many ladies shoes around here?

2126
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:29,420
Let's see, what do we want to get?

2127
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:33,160
This is just mocking me now.

2128
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:39,360
I want to try the lavatory since I've never gotten it, but...

2129
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:45,060
What are you picking up?

2130
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:46,980
Oh, some coins.

2131
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:54,760
Passageway?

2132
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,380
Conference room?

2133
02:09:58,840 --> 02:09:59,980
Dining room.

2134
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:01,080
Oh, these are lame.

2135
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:05,040
Minky is cute, pass it on.

2136
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:05,400
No!

2137
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:07,840
Let's just...

2138
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:11,760
I've unlocked both before, so...

2139
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:14,960
This one?

2140
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:18,780
Billiard room!

2141
02:10:19,380 --> 02:10:20,340
Mail room.

2142
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:23,880
A package will be delivered here on the day after drafting this room.

2143
02:10:26,100 --> 02:10:27,300
Wait, so...

2144
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:29,600
If I...

2145
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:32,820
Well, probably this would be better than the billiard then.

2146
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:34,640
Yeah, mail room for the next run.

2147
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:39,340
Order placed!

2148
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,060
That's so exciting.

2149
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:44,040
Simon P. Jones.

2150
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:45,140
Dad.

2151
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:50,220
Mount Holly Estate.

2152
02:10:52,380 --> 02:10:54,640
Hey buddy, how's it going up there in that big house?

2153
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:59,440
I think most people would be pretty scared being alone for this length of time, but I have a feeling you're doing just fine.

2154
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:08,120
I imagine you're happy as a clam, perfectly content on the estate, with the exploration and opportunities for adventure that present themselves each day.

2155
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:13,180
As I'm writing this, you're currently in the garage packing...

2156
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:15,440
Oh, in the garage packing the tent!

2157
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,540
I wanted to try to post this letter before we depart tomorrow so that it has a chance to arrive during your first few days on the estate.

2158
02:11:21,540 --> 02:11:25,600
But with all the preparations, I'm not sure that I'm going to find the time.

2159
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:31,180
There's so much I want to say, and I'm sure I'll forget to tell you Friday night.

2160
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:33,860
Sometimes it's easier for me to just jot this stuff down.

2161
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,760
You're yelling at me right now to come bring you a pillowcase.

2162
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:38,840
Hold on a second, I'll be right back.

2163
02:11:40,740 --> 02:11:46,040
I can tell you're really excited, but I think you might feel a little guilty about being so happy the day after the funeral.

2164
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,540
Believe me, I know how long Uncle Herbert...

2165
02:11:49,540 --> 02:11:50,520
Oh, Herbie!

2166
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:52,740
...worked on setting this up for you.

2167
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:57,400
And I know from our conversations just how much happiness this final project brought him.

2168
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:59,920
So do both of us a favor, be excited.

2169
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:02,960
This house really is amazing.

2170
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:10,380
I know it's been almost seven years since we were last up there, and I'm really curious to hear just how much you remember from those summer trips.

2171
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:17,960
You've always been smarter than me at this kind of thing, so I'm not sure how much guidance or inspiration I can offer before your trip...

2172
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:21,300
...that will actually be useful to you.

2173
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:29,640
Despite my best intentions, I'm sure that on Friday, I'll end up leaving you with a few of my overused cliché expressions when we say farewell.

2174
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:30,800
Later, alligator!

2175
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:31,780
Dad.

2176
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:32,640
P.S.

2177
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:36,420
Get some sleep each night and don't spend all your time each day planning...

2178
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:39,720
D-D-Dirigiblox?

2179
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:41,040
The hell is that?

2180
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:42,580
Is that supposed to be Minecraft?

2181
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:42,820
Minecraft?

2182
02:12:46,180 --> 02:12:47,760
I wanna play...

2183
02:12:49,720 --> 02:12:50,320
Dirigiblox.

2184
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:54,220
This room is so quiet.

2185
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:56,560
Royal mail?

2186
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:01,660
Wait, what's this?

2187
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:13,300
Utility room feels like more detailed instructions will be sent by electronic mail to the address the client has provided.

2188
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:15,140
Press any button to activate blue.

2189
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:18,160
Press the blue indicator next to red to activate purple.

2190
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:21,320
Five purple indicators are needed to activate the sixth.

2191
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:23,800
Aha!

2192
02:13:28,060 --> 02:13:28,340
Nice.

2193
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:33,300
Please return all correspondence and packages addressed to Denny Ravain to sender...

2194
02:13:34,200 --> 02:13:34,960
...as he is no longer...

2195
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,800
As he is no longer...

2196
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:37,000
Wait.

2197
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:39,740
As he no longer is employed with our staff.

2198
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:42,800
I wonder if he watched the Dirigiblox movie.

2199
02:13:44,380 --> 02:13:45,140
Wait.

2200
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:45,720
Wait.

2201
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:47,880
Oh god.

2202
02:13:48,340 --> 02:13:49,220
Can you read that?

2203
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:53,140
What?

2204
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:54,940
What does that say?

2205
02:14:00,340 --> 02:14:01,100
What?

2206
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,060
You need an item.

2207
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:11,940
Something about stealing the baron's mail.

2208
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:17,040
Beatrice's symbol from Umineko.

2209
02:14:21,310 --> 02:14:22,530
Closer to the screen.

2210
02:14:22,670 --> 02:14:23,710
I'm reading it.

2211
02:14:24,210 --> 02:14:24,290
Did...

2212
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:28,760
Did...

2213
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:32,060
Ever prove...

2214
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:36,520
He was the one that stole...

2215
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:38,440
The baron's mail.

2216
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:39,660
Did they ever prove?

2217
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:43,140
Did they ever prove that he was the one to steal the baron's mail?

2218
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:46,320
So, Denny is a menace.

2219
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:46,660
Hold on.

2220
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:47,540
I'm gonna write that down.

2221
02:14:47,540 --> 02:14:49,800
Denny sucks and steals mail.

2222
02:14:52,660 --> 02:14:53,460
Denny...

2223
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:56,580
Ravaine...

2224
02:14:56,580 --> 02:14:58,000
Just in case there is more than one.

2225
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:01,560
Sucks...

2226
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:03,540
And steals...

2227
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:07,580
Mail...

2228
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,200
Fired.

2229
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:17,640
I don't need an item.

2230
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:19,180
I just need my eyes.

2231
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:21,760
My eyes are the prize.

2232
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,060
My eyes are items.

2233
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:27,160
Cool.

2234
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:30,260
I think we could just...

2235
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,440
Go to sleep then.

2236
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:34,960
Since this is a dead run, officially.

2237
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:36,580
So sad.

2238
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,320
I can't make it past...

2239
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:41,380
I can't make it past here.

2240
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:42,980
Past six.

2241
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:45,480
Call it a day.

2242
02:15:47,060 --> 02:15:48,080
The fuse box?

2243
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:49,300
I don't think that would...

2244
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:50,560
Wait, try the breaker box.

2245
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:52,760
Wait, what do you mean, Maya?

2246
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:54,820
What do you mean the breaker box?

2247
02:15:57,420 --> 02:15:58,300
Check the boudoir?

2248
02:15:58,420 --> 02:15:58,740
Why?

2249
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:02,800
What did I miss in here?

2250
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:08,920
This...

2251
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:09,640
Lighting?

2252
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:15,400
Oh, I have the code!

2253
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:17,440
Oh, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

2254
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,420
I think the safe is in here.

2255
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:22,600
I didn't see it though.

2256
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:23,800
Well, let's just go back.

2257
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:26,760
I don't wanna waste another step.

2258
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:28,100
All my money!

2259
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:32,860
Security...

2260
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:35,920
Behind the screen.

2261
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:37,300
Oh, maybe I missed it then.

2262
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:38,920
Okay, I'll trust you guys.

2263
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:40,700
I'll trust you guys.

2264
02:16:45,900 --> 02:16:47,620
Okay, so for this...

2265
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:54,670
Wait.

2266
02:16:56,890 --> 02:16:57,990
Oh, wait, okay.

2267
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:06,280
Wait, what do I have to click?

2268
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:07,400
I had it before.

2269
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:09,040
Ah!

2270
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:21,600
Do I click this?

2271
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:23,440
Ah!

2272
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:29,060
You screenshotted it, right?

2273
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:31,960
How do I access Steam screenshots?

2274
02:17:36,890 --> 02:17:38,170
Yes.

2275
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:44,710
Tab.

2276
02:17:47,450 --> 02:17:48,650
My screenshots!

2277
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:49,870
Thank you!

2278
02:17:50,630 --> 02:17:51,370
Thank you, Rob.

2279
02:17:56,310 --> 02:17:56,950
Okay,

2280
02:18:00,350 --> 02:18:01,370
press the blue...

2281
02:18:02,550 --> 02:18:03,750
to make it purple.

2282
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:09,540
Uh-oh.

2283
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:13,640
There we go, okay.

2284
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:19,380
Why did it turn that one?

2285
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:23,860
Okay.

2286
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:46,680
I did it.

2287
02:18:56,310 --> 02:18:58,070
That's what it looks like in the screenshot.

2288
02:19:01,630 --> 02:19:03,130
One more click of the red one.

2289
02:19:04,310 --> 02:19:04,490
Oh!

2290
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:10,350
Uh...

2291
02:19:11,850 --> 02:19:12,410
Okay.

2292
02:19:16,660 --> 02:19:18,160
Maybe we'll go to the...

2293
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:20,160
Safe?

2294
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,640
Yeah, we need one more message for the e-mail.

2295
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:24,960
Yeah, I said that we would get another...

2296
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:27,480
We gotta get another e-mail message or something.

2297
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:29,380
Maybe it will be sent here.

2298
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:31,300
Did you play Myst?

2299
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:33,520
My dad played Myst.

2300
02:19:34,560 --> 02:19:36,160
And I attempted Myst.

2301
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:43,700
Any other game puzzles that make you simmer with rage at remembering them in any game?

2302
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:45,800
Nothing I can think of.

2303
02:19:47,880 --> 02:19:49,060
Okay, main menu.

2304
02:19:53,460 --> 02:19:55,780
Oh, I don't know the password.

2305
02:20:07,430 --> 02:20:11,530
Let's just try going back to the boudoir.

2306
02:20:13,510 --> 02:20:16,110
This is a pretty dead run anyway, so...

2307
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:28,880
Oh, I see it here.

2308
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:29,780
Ah!

2309
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:34,220
A-0-0-A-5.

2310
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:38,940
Okay.

2311
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:44,900
We don't have that yet.

2312
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:47,220
Dang it.

2313
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:51,240
It's not your safe.

2314
02:20:55,140 --> 02:20:58,160
I got a hint?

2315
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:00,280
Wait, want the hint?

2316
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:04,020
You can figure it out in this room.

2317
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:10,560
Is it 12-25?

2318
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:11,720
Christmas?

2319
02:21:17,250 --> 02:21:18,290
Or 25-12?

2320
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:29,370
Where were you?

2321
02:21:30,870 --> 02:21:31,710
Four.

2322
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:40,730
Herbert, I was distraught to learn that you have chosen to omit the details of our dear Marion's disappearance from the public record.

2323
02:21:41,170 --> 02:21:46,250
It is no surprise to me that the Royal Court would want this embarrassment kept as quiet as possible.

2324
02:21:46,690 --> 02:21:53,030
But I am shocked that you have so little regard for your niece that you would play this King's Skullion.

2325
02:21:55,370 --> 02:21:56,970
That was my birthday two days ago!

2326
02:21:57,130 --> 02:21:58,310
Janie, happy birthday!

2327
02:22:01,810 --> 02:22:04,710
Happy birthday to you!

2328
02:22:05,210 --> 02:22:07,870
Happy birthday to you!

2329
02:22:08,470 --> 02:22:11,970
Happy birthday, dear Janie!

2330
02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:13,850
Dobbs Marsh.

2331
02:22:15,430 --> 02:22:18,370
Happy birthday to you!

2332
02:22:19,410 --> 02:22:20,510
Happy birthday!

2333
02:22:23,860 --> 02:22:27,020
And stoop to kissing the foot that treads upon her memory.

2334
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:31,760
She gave up her family, her fortune, and her life, and all you can do is think of your name.

2335
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:40,800
Having never had a family name nor fortune of my own, I cannot personally condemn you for faltering in your commitment to make the same sacrifice as she did.

2336
02:22:41,100 --> 02:22:52,560
But for the love of God, do not buy that same display of weakness, clutch your petty assets so tightly that you undermine the cause that she forfeited everything to further.

2337
02:22:53,260 --> 02:23:02,460
Our countrymen must be made aware of the price she paid and must be made to see the color of the flag she flew as she rode into the darkness of a hundred nights.

2338
02:23:03,320 --> 02:23:06,380
To deny her story is to deny her life.

2339
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:08,480
Oh, Daniel.

2340
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:26,220
If through your silence you bless this betrayal, our son Simon, your heir will inherit a fortune of lies and will spit upon your grave when he learns of your cursed foolishness.

2341
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:30,420
Needless to say, we will not be coming for Christmas this year.

2342
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:31,440
Daniel.

2343
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:36,420
The handwriting changed?

2344
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:39,420
Oh, yeah, you're right.

2345
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:44,140
It did change.

2346
02:23:45,180 --> 02:23:46,300
Damn, Daniel.

2347
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:53,280
No, wait.

2348
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:54,780
No, it didn't.

2349
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:57,060
The H's are still the same.

2350
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:57,840
But

2351
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:07,420
it's like this has italics and this doesn't.

2352
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:11,560
Because you can see the H in the and the H here are both the same.

2353
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:13,820
It just has italics or not.

2354
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:16,700
The boss strikes again.

2355
02:24:17,240 --> 02:24:18,380
The slant changed.

2356
02:24:18,480 --> 02:24:19,160
Yeah, yeah.

2357
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:21,200
Look at the capitals.

2358
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:23,380
Yeah, it's just the slant.

2359
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:33,540
So this feels like I should write something down.

2360
02:24:33,540 --> 02:24:34,740
Like so Marion.

2361
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:36,660
I don't know who that is.

2362
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:39,440
Where'd my pen go?

2363
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:41,560
I lost it.

2364
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:42,280
Oh, just kidding.

2365
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:43,580
I have it.

2366
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:45,820
Marion.

2367
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:50,200
Disappeared.

2368
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:55,140
I feel like I need to draw like a family tree.

2369
02:24:57,480 --> 02:25:00,500
And then dad is Daniel.

2370
02:25:08,770 --> 02:25:09,540
But what?

2371
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:13,200
We don't know why she disappeared.

2372
02:25:14,550 --> 02:25:17,020
Or if she's... I don't understand.

2373
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:21,940
She got Isekai'd.

2374
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:22,320
Yeah.

2375
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:25,800
Our son.

2376
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:28,620
Simon.

2377
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:29,420
That's us.

2378
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:33,450
So...

2379
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,220
So our dad is Daniel.

2380
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:56,220
Okay.

2381
02:25:57,140 --> 02:25:58,380
I'm not good with names.

2382
02:25:58,480 --> 02:26:00,160
So I'm gonna be really...

2383
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:04,020
I'm gonna be really bad unless I write this down.

2384
02:26:05,660 --> 02:26:06,220
Okay.

2385
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:08,880
Okay.

2386
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:11,320
So we have a sister?

2387
02:26:12,220 --> 02:26:12,520
Maybe?

2388
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:15,960
Interesting.

2389
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:19,260
Alright.

2390
02:26:19,540 --> 02:26:21,360
Shall we call it a day?

2391
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:23,430
Thanks, guys, for the help with the...

2392
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:25,080
safe.

2393
02:26:25,220 --> 02:26:26,860
That was very...

2394
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:27,180
helpful.

2395
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:28,340
That was good.

2396
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:29,720
We got some...

2397
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:30,360
We got some...

2398
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:33,500
Some...

2399
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:35,220
Some information at least.

2400
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:36,160
So...

2401
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:37,100
Call it a day.

2402
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:38,280
Call it a day.

2403
02:26:40,060 --> 02:26:41,200
Not in the stream.

2404
02:26:41,540 --> 02:26:42,600
Just in the game.

2405
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:44,760
Actually...

2406
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:46,360
I might call it a day in the stream.

2407
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:49,540
It's been a little shorter, but I...

2408
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:54,840
I had a pretty long day, so...

2409
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:57,540
Yeah, we got the permanent unlock.

2410
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:58,780
That was huge!

2411
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:00,360
Maybe... Okay.

2412
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:01,360
Maybe I won't.

2413
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:02,740
Maybe I'll do one more day.

2414
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:03,560
I'll do one more day.

2415
02:27:04,260 --> 02:27:06,400
I really like this game, so I kind of want to keep going.

2416
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:08,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2417
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:09,820
We'll do one more day.

2418
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:10,280
One more day.

2419
02:27:10,340 --> 02:27:10,860
Don't leave yet!

2420
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:12,020
Don't leave yet!

2421
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:13,300
Don't leave!

2422
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:19,500
And a drink because of my spicy...

2423
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:22,240
I accidentally got spicy popcorn chicken.

2424
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:24,240
I didn't notice it was spicy.

2425
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:26,800
So give me a second.

2426
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:29,120
Wait, is there music at least?

2427
02:27:30,860 --> 02:27:31,140
Yeah.

2428
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:33,660
You can listen.

2429
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:34,480
I'll be right back.

2430
02:28:55,170 --> 02:28:56,110
I am back.

2431
02:28:56,470 --> 02:28:58,350
And with my dinner lunch.

2432
02:28:58,990 --> 02:28:59,290
Yay!

2433
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:02,950
Yay, yay, yay.

2434
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:09,730
Shall we continue?

2435
02:29:14,460 --> 02:29:14,860
Hmm.

2436
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,160
Hmm!

2437
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:18,780
Wait, what is this red letter here now?

2438
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:22,060
Dinner lunch at 10.

2439
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:24,820
Well, I had it for lunch and I didn't finish it, so now it's dinner.

2440
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:28,020
I didn't eat anything before this.

2441
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:30,580
I had a late lunch.

2442
02:29:30,860 --> 02:29:31,320
Was it late?

2443
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:31,760
No.

2444
02:29:33,580 --> 02:29:34,640
Hope you're doing well.

2445
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:35,280
Thank you!

2446
02:29:38,220 --> 02:29:40,080
Let's not go forward first.

2447
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:40,980
Let's go this way.

2448
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:48,310
Hmm.

2449
02:29:58,630 --> 02:30:00,610
Sorry, I was so spicy.

2450
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:10,710
I'm okay.

2451
02:30:12,990 --> 02:30:14,090
The shed.

2452
02:30:14,870 --> 02:30:15,370
Yes.

2453
02:30:15,710 --> 02:30:17,390
I'm gonna grab two items.

2454
02:30:18,030 --> 02:30:21,710
We might need a key for the shed, so maybe there's gonna be one in here.

2455
02:30:24,790 --> 02:30:26,930
Okay, dye is good.

2456
02:30:27,910 --> 02:30:29,290
And gemmy is good.

2457
02:30:30,010 --> 02:30:31,230
I like that.

2458
02:30:31,290 --> 02:30:32,210
Let's go back outside.

2459
02:30:41,390 --> 02:30:42,230
I'm okay.

2460
02:30:48,520 --> 02:30:49,780
Let's go check it out.

2461
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:50,400
The shed.

2462
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:56,720
Oh, we don't.

2463
02:30:59,080 --> 02:30:59,680
Hopeful?

2464
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:05,560
Special floor plans now cost additional feet instead of a gem.

2465
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:06,940
Wait.

2466
02:31:10,120 --> 02:31:12,140
Wait a second.

2467
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:14,980
That was our big...

2468
02:31:15,540 --> 02:31:19,080
That was our big problem last time.

2469
02:31:21,480 --> 02:31:25,640
I couldn't progress because I didn't have gemmies.

2470
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:25,840
Let's...

2471
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:36,900
We'll have to be careful of our feet, but I think this will be good.

2472
02:31:45,940 --> 02:31:49,640
Sorry, I'm eating this, but I'm drinking a lot of milk too.

2473
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:52,760
Good for the feet economy.

2474
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:55,580
Notice of termination.

2475
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:57,700
This is...

2476
02:31:58,520 --> 02:32:00,100
Denny, you suck, Denny.

2477
02:32:00,440 --> 02:32:01,600
Notice of termination.

2478
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:07,260
Dear Mr. Ravain, Your half-hearted dedication and maintenance of the grounds have been greatly appreciated.

2479
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:16,580
However, I regret to inform you that your services as the groundskeeper at Mount Holly will no longer be required.

2480
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:17,840
Effective immediately.

2481
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:19,780
So he was the groundskeeper.

2482
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:27,280
Hold on, I'm writing that down.

2483
02:32:34,700 --> 02:32:35,260
Groundskeeper.

2484
02:32:36,900 --> 02:32:46,220
This decision has been made after careful consideration and is based upon repeated observations and documented instances of neglect in the performance of your duties.

2485
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:56,640
The state of the green rooms in particular has deteriorated significantly over the last few months, which reflects poorly on the rest of the staff.

2486
02:32:56,640 --> 02:33:05,260
You are required to vacate the hovel by the 20th of March, ensuring all tools and equipment belonging to the estate are returned to the tool shed in good condition.

2487
02:33:05,660 --> 02:33:09,080
Your final wages will be settled promptly upon completion of these instructions.

2488
02:33:09,700 --> 02:33:13,340
We thank you for your time and service and wish you the best in your future endeavors.

2489
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:17,880
Anne Babbage, House Manager Yikes.

2490
02:33:20,220 --> 02:33:22,960
Oh my god, that's all he has for a bed?

2491
02:33:39,710 --> 02:33:42,150
He was cookin'.

2492
02:33:42,150 --> 02:33:43,550
Where is room 46?

2493
02:33:44,410 --> 02:33:47,310
Wait, was he trying to get my... he's trying to steal my inheritance!

2494
02:33:56,620 --> 02:33:57,140
Coincidence?

2495
02:34:05,180 --> 02:34:05,700
7590.

2496
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:07,200
Tested my full house theory.

2497
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:08,800
No luck, as expected.

2498
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:16,560
What do you mean two starting rooms?

2499
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:19,160
Does he count the outside as a starting room?

2500
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:24,220
I mean, you do lose steps when you...

2501
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:26,440
When you go outside.

2502
02:34:32,990 --> 02:34:33,550
Interesting.

2503
02:34:34,730 --> 02:34:35,290
Interesting.

2504
02:34:37,630 --> 02:34:38,670
The mystery.

2505
02:34:41,150 --> 02:34:43,030
This sad, sad bed.

2506
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:45,750
You know what, Denny, maybe you just... maybe...

2507
02:34:45,750 --> 02:34:51,470
Maybe it's for the best.

2508
02:34:58,800 --> 02:34:59,300
Oh?

2509
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:07,080
Oh, that's where that is?

2510
02:35:07,140 --> 02:35:08,400
Did I just help you solve a puzzle?

2511
02:35:10,460 --> 02:35:11,220
You're welcome.

2512
02:35:13,100 --> 02:35:14,220
I'm a bit of a genius.

2513
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:16,720
Okay.

2514
02:35:17,820 --> 02:35:18,320
Alright.

2515
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:22,360
So that...

2516
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:24,640
Was pretty good.

2517
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:28,860
I'm starting to think that the end goal...

2518
02:35:28,860 --> 02:35:31,440
Of this game is basically Clue, the board game.

2519
02:35:31,800 --> 02:35:32,880
Yeah, I know, right?

2520
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:36,160
Family drama edition and set up by grandpa.

2521
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:39,860
Maybe, yeah.

2522
02:35:40,580 --> 02:35:41,640
Wait, so if I...

2523
02:35:42,580 --> 02:35:45,200
Don't... Oh, I can't go this way because I don't have it.

2524
02:35:46,020 --> 02:35:46,240
Okay.

2525
02:35:49,860 --> 02:35:52,060
I'm three-fourths of the fires.

2526
02:35:52,240 --> 02:35:52,920
Oh no!

2527
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:55,440
You'll get it.

2528
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:57,260
Where did that light up anyway?

2529
02:35:57,460 --> 02:35:57,820
Like over...

2530
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:01,840
Oh, I can't make a wish yet.

2531
02:36:02,460 --> 02:36:03,020
Over here?

2532
02:36:05,140 --> 02:36:05,700
Yes.

2533
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:09,000
Exciting!

2534
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:11,420
Exciting, exciting, exciting.

2535
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:15,180
Let's go back in.

2536
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:24,120
So now anything that needs a gem is free.

2537
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:25,780
That's exciting.

2538
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:29,600
Or not free, but...

2539
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:35,240
Let's do the pantry.

2540
02:36:49,150 --> 02:36:49,330
Oh!

2541
02:36:49,630 --> 02:36:50,950
My package has been delivered!

2542
02:36:51,830 --> 02:36:54,390
Wait, but this is... This will... You know what?

2543
02:36:55,170 --> 02:36:56,050
It's fine.

2544
02:36:56,610 --> 02:36:58,070
Let's get the package.

2545
02:37:00,430 --> 02:37:01,470
Package delivered.

2546
02:37:01,730 --> 02:37:02,130
This one?

2547
02:37:04,810 --> 02:37:05,810
Packing slip.

2548
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:07,170
The Sinka Company.

2549
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:08,970
K.

2550
02:37:09,130 --> 02:37:09,570
Thompson.

2551
02:37:11,090 --> 02:37:12,310
Do we know a K.

2552
02:37:12,390 --> 02:37:12,990
Thompson yet?

2553
02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:21,520
Grass compass, two gems, two keys.

2554
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:22,420
Oh!

2555
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:24,920
Five, two, five, four.

2556
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:25,480
I'm gonna...

2557
02:37:26,500 --> 02:37:27,480
Just in case.

2558
02:37:33,240 --> 02:37:34,320
No way!

2559
02:37:34,460 --> 02:37:36,880
Draws floor plans leading north more frequently!

2560
02:37:37,900 --> 02:37:38,920
That's awesome.

2561
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:45,480
Oh yeah, that's good!

2562
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:47,020
Oh yeah, baby!

2563
02:37:48,860 --> 02:37:50,580
Oh yeah, baby!

2564
02:37:52,020 --> 02:37:54,180
Okay, I don't think there's anything else in here, so...

2565
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:59,120
Cooking now, for real.

2566
02:38:00,300 --> 02:38:02,420
So now if we try to... This is our only way.

2567
02:38:06,020 --> 02:38:07,020
The den.

2568
02:38:07,820 --> 02:38:08,600
We shall go.

2569
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:17,720
It sucks though, because a lot of these rooms were getting gemmies, but I guess... I wish I could sell them.

2570
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:19,120
You know?

2571
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:26,040
Wait!

2572
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:29,280
Do you think I should use it on this or no?

2573
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:30,720
I feel like if I have an excess...

2574
02:38:32,440 --> 02:38:35,260
It would be good, but...

2575
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:42,800
Maybe later.

2576
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:48,140
Yeah, I wouldn't personally... Yeah, I think so too.

2577
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:54,720
Check one item and retrieve it on another day.

2578
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:56,500
Interesting, okay.

2579
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:58,600
We have a hallway.

2580
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,080
We have a corridor.

2581
02:39:03,220 --> 02:39:06,700
I think we'll go with the hallway.

2582
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:10,220
Corridor?

2583
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:10,800
Why?

2584
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:11,740
Because it's always unlocked?

2585
02:39:13,340 --> 02:39:15,180
I don't know what that means yet though.

2586
02:39:15,220 --> 02:39:17,640
I haven't experienced anything being locked.

2587
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:23,300
Oh, do you mean because this door is always unlocked?

2588
02:39:31,180 --> 02:39:35,820
For some reason I was thinking like with the security keys or... You know, stuff like that.

2589
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:40,300
Or like if the power goes out, you know, the other doors lock.

2590
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:41,280
I don't know what I'm thinking, okay?

2591
02:39:51,780 --> 02:39:55,580
I feel we are too slow for it to be...

2592
02:39:56,080 --> 02:40:00,540
For it to be like a security door, but let's just go with the corridor then.

2593
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:03,040
Better later in the run, I see.

2594
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:08,620
What do we got?

2595
02:40:09,560 --> 02:40:10,380
Oh, wow.

2596
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:11,980
Oh my gosh, you guys were...

2597
02:40:13,120 --> 02:40:14,540
Everything is pointing north!

2598
02:40:19,420 --> 02:40:21,080
So this will require...

2599
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:26,760
Okay, the gemmy thing might kick us in the ass now because I have four gemmies!

2600
02:40:39,660 --> 02:40:42,480
Sorry, I'm eating and thinking at the same time.

2601
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:45,920
Could be pricey, it could.

2602
02:40:56,490 --> 02:41:00,770
But we unlocked that early game, so...

2603
02:41:03,730 --> 02:41:05,370
Let's just go for it, baby!

2604
02:41:08,690 --> 02:41:10,830
I almost want to get the commissary.

2605
02:41:14,920 --> 02:41:17,220
But I mean we could just keep going up.

2606
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:22,840
We could just keep going up, I mean...

2607
02:41:28,830 --> 02:41:29,830
Let's just, you know what?

2608
02:41:30,350 --> 02:41:30,630
Up.

2609
02:41:31,530 --> 02:41:32,690
Let's just keep going up.

2610
02:41:36,060 --> 02:41:37,580
Oh, this is the one that says...

2611
02:41:39,480 --> 02:41:40,280
Use the key.

2612
02:41:44,990 --> 02:41:47,470
Leads to a room color of your choice.

2613
02:41:49,190 --> 02:41:49,750
Wait...

2614
02:41:49,750 --> 02:41:51,910
Will the secret passage go up?

2615
02:41:55,510 --> 02:41:57,650
Does the secret passage go up?

2616
02:41:57,830 --> 02:41:58,450
I can't tell.

2617
02:42:00,570 --> 02:42:01,130
Yes?

2618
02:42:01,290 --> 02:42:01,570
No?

2619
02:42:02,570 --> 02:42:04,130
Looks like it goes up.

2620
02:42:04,370 --> 02:42:04,930
Potentially.

2621
02:42:09,700 --> 02:42:11,200
It does look like it, right?

2622
02:42:11,240 --> 02:42:11,660
Right here?

2623
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,800
I'm trying to get more steps.

2624
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:35,220
But...

2625
02:42:35,220 --> 02:42:38,580
The storeroom could be good and it's free, so...

2626
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:39,560
Let's go with the storeroom.

2627
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:42,440
Hey, Minky.

2628
02:42:42,820 --> 02:42:43,080
Hello!

2629
02:42:44,100 --> 02:42:44,620
Hello?

2630
02:42:44,960 --> 02:42:45,240
Hello?

2631
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:45,760
Hello!

2632
02:42:46,760 --> 02:42:47,420
And a gemmy.

2633
02:42:50,060 --> 02:42:52,560
This time it doesn't have the stars on it.

2634
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:56,260
So I feel if I get the four stars...

2635
02:42:57,540 --> 02:42:59,680
I have to find the painting with it.

2636
02:43:08,330 --> 02:43:09,730
Key to... Oh, here we go.

2637
02:43:10,970 --> 02:43:11,790
Can you imagine?

2638
02:43:12,030 --> 02:43:12,930
It's just like, I want a red...

2639
02:43:16,290 --> 02:43:16,690
Halls?

2640
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:17,950
Green thumb?

2641
02:43:18,950 --> 02:43:19,910
What's a gold room?

2642
02:43:19,950 --> 02:43:23,590
Oh, that's like the kitchen or the commissary.

2643
02:43:24,510 --> 02:43:25,970
I mean, I could just get a hallway.

2644
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:28,890
We could keep going up.

2645
02:43:40,290 --> 02:43:42,010
What if I get to the top and I have nothing?

2646
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:49,800
The north is stored in the halls.

2647
02:44:07,210 --> 02:44:09,470
Good thing we got another one.

2648
02:44:11,070 --> 02:44:13,110
Yeah, they say it's...

2649
02:44:15,030 --> 02:44:16,410
Wait, these are new!

2650
02:44:18,170 --> 02:44:20,310
Hallway doors are always unlocked.

2651
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:23,570
The aquarium!

2652
02:44:26,990 --> 02:44:29,090
Is every color of room.

2653
02:44:36,260 --> 02:44:36,740
Wow.

2654
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:41,060
Guys, this is the furthest we've been!

2655
02:44:41,160 --> 02:44:45,880
They do say that this is locked, so I might be just screwing myself over a little bit.

2656
02:44:48,020 --> 02:44:49,800
Wait, hopefully we get a beat.

2657
02:44:56,340 --> 02:44:58,080
I didn't even know you could get nothing.

2658
02:45:00,340 --> 02:45:00,820
Ouch.

2659
02:45:01,160 --> 02:45:01,600
OK.

2660
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:03,660
This one is locked.

2661
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:09,240
OK.

2662
02:45:14,300 --> 02:45:16,760
Now we are...

2663
02:45:18,260 --> 02:45:20,760
So we can go back to the drawing room.

2664
02:45:22,220 --> 02:45:23,800
And unlock over here.

2665
02:45:24,860 --> 02:45:26,040
North we go up?

2666
02:45:26,820 --> 02:45:27,840
You guys are insane.

2667
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:29,220
You guys...

2668
02:45:29,220 --> 02:45:30,420
You guys are insane!

2669
02:45:32,540 --> 02:45:33,420
North!

2670
02:45:36,930 --> 02:45:37,670
Uh-oh.

2671
02:45:40,030 --> 02:45:40,550
Redraw?

2672
02:45:44,590 --> 02:45:46,150
Let's just redraw this.

2673
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:53,440
That's what I'm talking about baby.

2674
02:46:00,950 --> 02:46:02,890
This is so liminal space.

2675
02:46:07,790 --> 02:46:08,550
Hey I'm here!

2676
02:46:08,650 --> 02:46:09,070
Let me in!

2677
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:20,670
You can't go in the water.

2678
02:46:24,470 --> 02:46:25,790
Well I think it's sealed.

2679
02:46:28,990 --> 02:46:30,050
What do we got here?

2680
02:46:36,700 --> 02:46:38,080
Guys, I don't have a lot of money.

2681
02:46:40,140 --> 02:46:40,620
Guys?

2682
02:46:43,440 --> 02:46:44,340
I'm kind of in trouble.

2683
02:46:51,690 --> 02:46:52,530
The bedroom?

2684
02:46:53,470 --> 02:46:54,430
Let's do the bedroom.

2685
02:46:54,590 --> 02:46:56,010
We can kind of...

2686
02:46:57,410 --> 02:46:58,270
Oh my gosh!

2687
02:46:58,310 --> 02:46:58,830
An apple!

2688
02:46:58,830 --> 02:47:02,190
A day keeps the doctor away!

2689
02:47:03,310 --> 02:47:03,870
Nice.

2690
02:47:04,670 --> 02:47:05,630
Nice, nice, nice.

2691
02:47:06,410 --> 02:47:07,830
We can at least farm some...

2692
02:47:08,970 --> 02:47:10,170
Some steps here.

2693
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:13,830
I'm going to start looking in between things because apparently...

2694
02:47:14,810 --> 02:47:17,070
There's like coins and stuff on the floor.

2695
02:47:17,870 --> 02:47:20,090
I should have been doing that earlier but...

2696
02:47:20,090 --> 02:47:23,310
I don't know if they only unlock once you...

2697
02:47:24,270 --> 02:47:27,910
Once you get the metal detector or not but I don't know.

2698
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:33,260
Oh.

2699
02:47:41,050 --> 02:47:41,850
Blue note?

2700
02:47:41,950 --> 02:47:42,930
Oh it's just a postcard.

2701
02:48:01,940 --> 02:48:03,220
Let's go back to the drawing room.

2702
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:07,620
It's not a dead run yet.

2703
02:48:12,870 --> 02:48:14,290
Drafting pool rules.

2704
02:48:14,430 --> 02:48:18,330
The draft pool is your deck of potential floor plans.

2705
02:48:18,770 --> 02:48:23,590
Each time you draft, three random floor plans are drawn from the draft pool for you to select from.

2706
02:48:24,050 --> 02:48:27,350
The odds of drawing a specific floor plan may differ depending on the room.

2707
02:48:27,750 --> 02:48:29,230
Some rooms are more rare than others.

2708
02:48:29,950 --> 02:48:33,930
Floor plans added to the draft pool are removed at the end of the day unless otherwise stated.

2709
02:48:34,090 --> 02:48:34,510
No running.

2710
02:48:36,830 --> 02:48:37,310
Okay.

2711
02:48:44,220 --> 02:48:47,340
Keep your eyes peeled for some dirt on the floor.

2712
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:48,860
By the way.

2713
02:48:49,860 --> 02:48:51,400
And money on the floor.

2714
02:48:53,660 --> 02:48:56,400
That was the store room.

2715
02:49:09,460 --> 02:49:11,740
I don't really know what to pick here.

2716
02:49:17,070 --> 02:49:18,350
Oh yeah we can redraw.

2717
02:49:18,490 --> 02:49:18,810
You're right.

2718
02:49:19,770 --> 02:49:20,270
Thank you.

2719
02:49:31,130 --> 02:49:33,550
I wish there was something that gave us more steps.

2720
02:49:36,670 --> 02:49:37,150
But...

2721
02:49:40,250 --> 02:49:43,690
Yeah I think I'll do the courtyard because I was thinking that too.

2722
02:49:44,730 --> 02:49:46,170
Because it will have...

2723
02:49:52,020 --> 02:49:53,860
Our first security door.

2724
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:56,380
Okay coin.

2725
02:49:56,380 --> 02:49:58,180
Single coin.

2726
02:49:59,400 --> 02:50:01,060
Turn up.

2727
02:50:08,820 --> 02:50:10,140
Sorry.

2728
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:13,000
Okay.

2729
02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:17,060
It also goes down.

2730
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:25,780
Bless you.

2731
02:50:25,860 --> 02:50:26,460
Thank you.

2732
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:29,680
Thank you.

2733
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:34,580
I still haven't gotten the outdoors door on the right side.

2734
02:50:51,540 --> 02:50:53,880
I think I want the key instead actually.

2735
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:55,100
Bless you.

2736
02:50:55,340 --> 02:50:55,480
Thank you.

2737
02:50:56,360 --> 02:51:02,320
You have to go all the way to the right to get those rooms.

2738
02:51:02,420 --> 02:51:02,840
Exactly.

2739
02:51:03,820 --> 02:51:05,120
You need a kitchen.

2740
02:51:05,980 --> 02:51:07,320
But I don't have a lot of money.

2741
02:51:08,380 --> 02:51:09,540
I only have 6 coins.

2742
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:15,880
Oh get the breaker.

2743
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:17,760
You can depower the security doors.

2744
02:51:18,780 --> 02:51:20,440
Maybe that would be...

2745
02:51:20,440 --> 02:51:23,120
Oh yeah I guess that would be better than the security room.

2746
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:27,980
Let's do the nook.

2747
02:51:28,840 --> 02:51:29,800
And get a key.

2748
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:33,620
Let's do the nook.

2749
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:39,000
Do the nook and get a key.

2750
02:51:41,860 --> 02:51:42,460
And...

2751
02:51:42,460 --> 02:51:43,580
Is this locked?

2752
02:51:44,340 --> 02:51:44,580
No.

2753
02:51:53,330 --> 02:51:55,210
Go to the parlor.

2754
02:51:55,510 --> 02:51:56,210
Bless you Puki.

2755
02:52:00,250 --> 02:52:04,150
Oh yeah, we can get the A rank meal now.

2756
02:52:04,210 --> 02:52:05,030
You're right!

2757
02:52:05,330 --> 02:52:09,470
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

2758
02:52:11,890 --> 02:52:12,890
Let's do the...

2759
02:52:14,130 --> 02:52:15,490
Let's do the parlor.

2760
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:23,960
Yeah, we got to ration our steps for real.

2761
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:27,980
It's a coin thing!

2762
02:52:28,700 --> 02:52:29,180
Nice!

2763
02:52:29,800 --> 02:52:32,160
Oh my gosh, now every time we collect 3 we get an extra.

2764
02:52:34,860 --> 02:52:36,140
Give me that.

2765
02:52:36,400 --> 02:52:37,320
Let's see what we got here.

2766
02:52:39,320 --> 02:52:40,980
Money, money, money.

2767
02:52:42,040 --> 02:52:43,380
This box is the...OK.

2768
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:45,960
This box is the blue box.

2769
02:52:46,600 --> 02:52:49,060
The box that claims to be black has the gems.

2770
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:50,700
Oh wait.

2771
02:52:51,900 --> 02:52:52,140
You!

2772
02:52:53,880 --> 02:52:54,900
This says blue?

2773
02:52:55,180 --> 02:52:55,420
Yeah.

2774
02:52:58,610 --> 02:52:59,930
It's always the blue.

2775
02:53:03,640 --> 02:53:06,860
I don't really need the gemmies anymore, but whatever.

2776
02:53:13,860 --> 02:53:14,300
Garages.

2777
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:15,440
3 more.

2778
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:23,500
Hold on.

2779
02:53:26,180 --> 02:53:27,960
And then we can go back outside.

2780
02:53:29,960 --> 02:53:32,580
We can get 3 more keys and then go back outside.

2781
02:53:33,140 --> 02:53:34,640
But it would be...

2782
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:37,140
We can go from the den maybe.

2783
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:38,740
Oh it's not powered!

2784
02:53:38,820 --> 02:53:39,340
You're right!

2785
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:40,580
It's not powered.

2786
02:53:41,580 --> 02:53:43,200
I didn't get the security room.

2787
02:53:50,370 --> 02:53:53,310
We were so blinded by going up, but...

2788
02:53:53,310 --> 02:53:55,550
We do have another...I can still get the keys.

2789
02:53:57,810 --> 02:53:59,430
Guys, I can still get the keys.

2790
02:54:00,230 --> 02:54:02,930
And this one was locked and this one was locked.

2791
02:54:03,430 --> 02:54:04,350
So let's do that.

2792
02:54:11,860 --> 02:54:12,380
See?

2793
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:14,760
We just can't open the garage door.

2794
02:54:17,280 --> 02:54:17,800
Kisses.

2795
02:54:24,280 --> 02:54:25,600
Will we make it?

2796
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:28,340
1, 2, 3, 4.

2797
02:54:36,600 --> 02:54:37,320
It's okay.

2798
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:40,660
Don't worry everybody.

2799
02:54:42,020 --> 02:54:42,940
Don't worry.

2800
02:54:44,360 --> 02:54:45,720
Don't worry.

2801
02:54:47,560 --> 02:54:49,600
We are getting 10 more steps.

2802
02:54:58,300 --> 02:54:59,380
There is something in here.

2803
02:55:00,080 --> 02:55:01,940
A magnifying glass.

2804
02:55:02,720 --> 02:55:04,580
Inspect documents of the estate more closely.

2805
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:06,860
Nice.

2806
02:55:10,100 --> 02:55:11,360
Have I gone in this room before?

2807
02:55:11,460 --> 02:55:12,540
Oh yeah, this is the guest one.

2808
02:55:12,620 --> 02:55:13,860
This is the guy who is just like...

2809
02:55:21,570 --> 02:55:21,930
Interesting.

2810
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:28,220
Now we go back to the bedroom.

2811
02:55:33,470 --> 02:55:34,190
No running.

2812
02:55:36,510 --> 02:55:37,450
And we gained 2.

2813
02:55:41,310 --> 02:55:41,950
Use?

2814
02:55:43,590 --> 02:55:44,530
The bedroom.

2815
02:55:44,770 --> 02:55:45,170
Got it.

2816
02:55:45,310 --> 02:55:47,090
Oh wait, not keys first.

2817
02:55:47,210 --> 02:55:48,870
These all suck.

2818
02:55:49,070 --> 02:55:49,390
Oh no.

2819
02:55:59,810 --> 02:56:00,450
Guys...

2820
02:56:10,620 --> 02:56:11,640
The chapel.

2821
02:56:33,370 --> 02:56:34,370
This is a pretty dead run.

2822
02:56:37,630 --> 02:56:38,470
Laboratory.

2823
02:56:40,870 --> 02:56:42,410
Experimental house features.

2824
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:57,080
This machine requires additional power.

2825
02:56:57,560 --> 02:57:00,040
Piped in from the boiler room.

2826
02:57:05,050 --> 02:57:05,790
I see.

2827
02:57:05,790 --> 02:57:05,850
I see.

2828
02:57:08,350 --> 02:57:14,970
I typically work over at Sinka Labs but got sent over here for a month to assist more with the new turbine tests.

2829
02:57:15,410 --> 02:57:16,370
I think I need some help.

2830
02:57:16,710 --> 02:57:21,850
For the past 3 days I have been unable to find the laboratory on the estate.

2831
02:57:22,310 --> 02:57:23,930
Today was the first success on that front.

2832
02:57:24,310 --> 02:57:26,230
Can anyone tell me if this is typical?

2833
02:57:26,490 --> 02:57:29,370
And if so, how do you get any work done?

2834
02:57:30,050 --> 02:57:32,170
Finally, someone who has stayed.

2835
02:57:32,910 --> 02:57:40,670
Before I arrived I was briefed on the way the doors worked but I must admit I did not expect to be excluded from my new workstation for the first week.

2836
02:57:41,190 --> 02:57:43,990
Any tips from my fellow technicians would be appreciated.

2837
02:57:44,250 --> 02:57:45,230
Kimberly Thompson.

2838
02:57:46,530 --> 02:57:49,490
Yes, Kimberly, finally a normal ass person.

2839
02:57:49,610 --> 02:57:51,210
That's a normal ass response.

2840
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:56,920
Eating and cooling curves.

2841
02:58:05,920 --> 02:58:07,960
Cooler is unaffected.

2842
02:58:12,320 --> 02:58:12,880
Okay.

2843
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:17,140
I don't get it.

2844
02:58:18,620 --> 02:58:20,160
I don't want to look at that.

2845
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:22,000
That actually hurts my brain.

2846
02:58:24,200 --> 02:58:24,980
Oh no.

2847
02:58:25,480 --> 02:58:27,280
Why do I need to look at this?

2848
02:58:28,820 --> 02:58:29,380
No.

2849
02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:31,600
No.

2850
02:58:31,800 --> 02:58:32,860
Is this re...

2851
02:58:35,530 --> 02:58:36,450
No thank you.

2852
02:58:39,440 --> 02:58:42,200
What does he have to do with it?

2853
02:58:42,500 --> 02:58:42,860
What?

2854
02:58:44,860 --> 02:58:47,400
Are they related?

2855
02:58:48,300 --> 02:58:50,340
Why are they connected?

2856
02:58:56,680 --> 02:58:59,220
Laboratory too scary.

2857
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:18,720
This one looks like probably one of those that you have to like, you know, you get just the right amount to get to like that line and all.

2858
02:59:19,140 --> 02:59:20,560
To figure out which levers.

2859
02:59:20,820 --> 02:59:21,560
That's what I imagine.

2860
02:59:22,200 --> 02:59:22,780
Check the computer.

2861
02:59:22,920 --> 02:59:24,460
I'm not there yet.

2862
02:59:26,020 --> 02:59:26,920
Effective immediately.

2863
02:59:27,080 --> 02:59:30,000
Electronic mail can only be accessed via the security terminal.

2864
02:59:30,420 --> 02:59:31,380
This is false.

2865
02:59:31,980 --> 02:59:33,220
Don't lie to me.

2866
02:59:33,220 --> 02:59:36,060
Wait, wasn't there an email that we were going to get?

2867
02:59:40,080 --> 02:59:48,540
In the laboratory, you are free to experiment by testing and combining different mechanics to create an original and unique house feature that will last until the end of the day.

2868
02:59:55,590 --> 02:59:59,150
Whenever you draw... Oh, next time you eat an apple.

2869
03:00:01,150 --> 03:00:02,890
Close ten steps.

2870
03:00:03,670 --> 03:00:05,010
Add three aquariums.

2871
03:00:05,130 --> 03:00:06,030
Okay, interesting.

2872
03:00:06,970 --> 03:00:08,230
That's just a cause and effect thing.

2873
03:00:08,270 --> 03:00:08,830
That's kind of fun.

2874
03:00:08,830 --> 03:00:10,810
No research log.

2875
03:00:10,850 --> 03:00:13,770
Research log will be available the day after an experiment has been performed.

2876
03:00:17,150 --> 03:00:17,590
Okay.

2877
03:00:18,150 --> 03:00:19,970
Yeah, useless for us today, pretty much.

2878
03:00:21,870 --> 03:00:26,650
Well, at least we got to see some of the new rooms, like the laboratory.

2879
03:00:27,050 --> 03:00:27,490
Laboratory.

2880
03:00:30,730 --> 03:00:31,610
Even though...

2881
03:00:32,250 --> 03:00:33,650
Wait, what do you mean by that?

2882
03:00:34,410 --> 03:00:35,290
What do you mean by that?

2883
03:00:36,970 --> 03:00:37,610
Three?

2884
03:00:42,020 --> 03:00:42,660
Oh.

2885
03:00:46,630 --> 03:00:47,610
Hold on.

2886
03:00:59,230 --> 03:01:00,390
Oh, it's a code.

2887
03:01:00,850 --> 03:01:01,530
Okay, H.

2888
03:01:02,230 --> 03:01:02,550
Wait.

2889
03:01:03,530 --> 03:01:05,070
One, two, H.

2890
03:01:10,240 --> 03:01:12,260
Okay, I'm going to try and figure this out.

2891
03:01:17,360 --> 03:01:18,240
Oh, cool.

2892
03:01:18,460 --> 03:01:19,220
Wait, twelve.

2893
03:01:23,560 --> 03:01:24,860
Let's do ten.

2894
03:01:30,220 --> 03:01:31,740
Ten was RN, right?

2895
03:01:41,060 --> 03:01:41,880
Is it...

2896
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:44,360
Is it... Wait.

2897
03:01:45,980 --> 03:01:50,040
It's not to this, because this goes to twelve, or to ten, and this is to twelve.

2898
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:53,680
This is not writing a sentence, I feel.

2899
03:01:56,380 --> 03:01:58,180
We'll do eight and twelve.

2900
03:02:01,380 --> 03:02:01,900
F.

2901
03:02:03,980 --> 03:02:04,840
And E.

2902
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:09,580
Oh, Sheena!

2903
03:02:09,960 --> 03:02:11,060
Thanks for the raid!

2904
03:02:11,380 --> 03:02:11,680
Hello!

2905
03:02:12,700 --> 03:02:13,580
Hello, everybody!

2906
03:02:17,500 --> 03:02:19,040
So many crabs.

2907
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:21,500
So cute, thank you!

2908
03:02:22,520 --> 03:02:25,100
Raymac, thanks for the gift, and for playing this game.

2909
03:02:25,220 --> 03:02:28,240
I'll have to be a really big brain for it, too.

2910
03:02:31,140 --> 03:02:31,740
S.

2911
03:02:35,940 --> 03:02:37,320
Mugmug, thanks for the gifting!

2912
03:02:39,420 --> 03:02:40,860
Mugmurabba, thanks for the five gifted.

2913
03:02:41,200 --> 03:02:45,280
Hello, Ducky, thanks for the gifting!

2914
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:46,780
Alright, hold on.

2915
03:02:46,820 --> 03:02:47,740
Let me do one.

2916
03:02:48,580 --> 03:02:50,220
What does the arrow mean, though?

2917
03:02:51,340 --> 03:02:53,880
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2918
03:02:58,220 --> 03:03:01,040
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2919
03:03:01,240 --> 03:03:01,520
Oh!

2920
03:03:02,360 --> 03:03:03,300
Okay, it says push!

2921
03:03:04,340 --> 03:03:04,780
Push?

2922
03:03:06,240 --> 03:03:08,940
Okay, so the first four is push.

2923
03:03:09,080 --> 03:03:09,740
Okay, four.

2924
03:03:14,580 --> 03:03:15,980
Four, seven.

2925
03:03:16,260 --> 03:03:17,440
I can do four, seven.

2926
03:03:19,140 --> 03:03:19,740
Push, push!

2927
03:03:21,540 --> 03:03:22,860
T.H.

2928
03:03:24,440 --> 03:03:26,860
Seven was P.A.

2929
03:03:28,700 --> 03:03:28,980
Okay.

2930
03:03:28,980 --> 03:03:29,200
Okay.

2931
03:03:29,800 --> 03:03:30,000
K.

2932
03:03:30,060 --> 03:03:31,020
Barney, thanks for the five gifted!

2933
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:31,880
T.

2934
03:03:31,960 --> 03:03:33,240
Dontcha, thanks for the five gifted!

2935
03:03:33,980 --> 03:03:35,040
Thank you, guys!

2936
03:03:35,960 --> 03:03:36,620
Push, push.

2937
03:03:37,400 --> 03:03:38,200
Um, what am I missing?

2938
03:03:38,640 --> 03:03:39,160
Five.

2939
03:03:41,220 --> 03:03:45,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2940
03:03:46,620 --> 03:03:47,140
Seven.

2941
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:53,860
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2942
03:03:54,580 --> 03:03:55,220
R.E.

2943
03:03:58,440 --> 03:03:59,300
R.E.

2944
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:04,320
I know I should probably just screen cap one of these.

2945
03:04:06,130 --> 03:04:08,180
Why did they... Seven also.

2946
03:04:11,320 --> 03:04:11,660
Yeah.

2947
03:04:14,580 --> 03:04:15,780
I did.

2948
03:04:15,940 --> 03:04:17,560
Yeah, well, whatever.

2949
03:04:18,900 --> 03:04:19,420
E.U.

2950
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:22,860
Push.

2951
03:04:24,060 --> 03:04:24,920
There.

2952
03:04:26,880 --> 03:04:27,340
Push.

2953
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:28,500
No.

2954
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,140
Push three up.

2955
03:04:31,620 --> 03:04:33,000
Push three up.

2956
03:04:36,530 --> 03:04:40,430
Ah, so nine is probably T.E., I imagine.

2957
03:04:42,930 --> 03:04:43,730
Oh!

2958
03:04:45,770 --> 03:04:48,650
Why'd they put those two numbers next to each other?

2959
03:04:49,170 --> 03:04:50,130
Yeah, T.E.

2960
03:04:51,030 --> 03:04:51,630
After.

2961
03:04:56,110 --> 03:04:57,630
After nine.

2962
03:04:57,630 --> 03:04:57,730
Nine.

2963
03:04:58,170 --> 03:05:01,150
Push three up after nine.

2964
03:05:01,610 --> 03:05:03,110
That's what it says!

2965
03:05:05,390 --> 03:05:06,810
I figured it out!

2966
03:05:14,530 --> 03:05:20,010
I could've probably just brute-forced the other one.

2967
03:05:21,970 --> 03:05:23,490
I fear...

2968
03:05:25,250 --> 03:05:27,110
I fear we could've brute-forced this.

2969
03:05:40,940 --> 03:05:43,820
But we don't have the power anyway, so...

2970
03:05:45,120 --> 03:05:46,680
What do we do now?

2971
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:49,720
I think we're locked.

2972
03:05:50,820 --> 03:05:52,360
Wait, can I make it back to the den?

2973
03:05:52,600 --> 03:05:57,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9!

2974
03:05:57,240 --> 03:05:57,600
No!

2975
03:06:06,040 --> 03:06:08,880
Don't tell Sheena, but she was streaming MGS3 before raiding.

2976
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:13,780
That's like my favorite game ever.

2977
03:06:14,580 --> 03:06:16,320
That's like my favorite game series ever!

2978
03:06:17,940 --> 03:06:19,520
I am out of gear.

2979
03:06:20,360 --> 03:06:22,320
A normal amount, probably.

2980
03:06:22,640 --> 03:06:23,920
Look at the size of this guy.

2981
03:06:26,020 --> 03:06:27,780
There's the little bedrooms.

2982
03:06:30,840 --> 03:06:32,320
This is a...

2983
03:06:33,180 --> 03:06:33,780
barbecue.

2984
03:06:36,060 --> 03:06:36,740
Therapist.

2985
03:06:40,040 --> 03:06:40,420
You do?

2986
03:06:40,540 --> 03:06:41,180
I had no idea.

2987
03:06:41,560 --> 03:06:43,580
Yeah, it's like my most well-kept secret.

2988
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:45,580
Ever.

2989
03:06:47,280 --> 03:06:50,360
I'm just that good at, you know...

2990
03:06:51,480 --> 03:06:52,780
keeping my mouth shut.

2991
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:55,240
Dang, this could've been the run.

2992
03:06:57,480 --> 03:07:00,500
We got so...

2993
03:07:00,500 --> 03:07:01,960
Oh wait, I got two more!

2994
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:03,960
Everything

2995
03:07:10,030 --> 03:07:13,070
I could've wanted is in here.

2996
03:07:15,090 --> 03:07:16,190
Yeah, for the bedroom.

2997
03:07:16,350 --> 03:07:16,970
That's right.

2998
03:07:25,410 --> 03:07:26,830
Also, that scene was hilarious.

2999
03:07:27,050 --> 03:07:27,870
That guy...

3000
03:07:27,870 --> 03:07:29,290
I can't bring him up around me.

3001
03:07:29,370 --> 03:07:30,290
I become unwell.

3002
03:07:30,590 --> 03:07:32,150
I'm already unwell because of him.

3003
03:07:34,230 --> 03:07:38,570
So for anybody who came in from the red and doesn't know, this is a roguelike puzzle game.

3004
03:07:41,410 --> 03:07:43,590
Our inheritance is in here, apparently.

3005
03:07:46,350 --> 03:07:46,790
But...

3006
03:07:46,790 --> 03:07:48,350
We have 50 steps a day.

3007
03:07:49,550 --> 03:07:50,150
Give or take.

3008
03:08:03,140 --> 03:08:06,100
Yeah, I'm eating spicy popcorn because it's all I have.

3009
03:08:11,500 --> 03:08:12,620
Is there a limited number of days?

3010
03:08:12,700 --> 03:08:13,660
I don't think so.

3011
03:08:14,500 --> 03:08:15,420
It didn't mention.

3012
03:08:18,660 --> 03:08:19,240
But...

3013
03:08:19,980 --> 03:08:23,980
Yeah, you have a limited number of days and...

3014
03:08:29,260 --> 03:08:29,840
And...

3015
03:08:30,820 --> 03:08:31,640
Hold on.

3016
03:08:32,080 --> 03:08:32,760
What was it?

3017
03:08:34,320 --> 03:08:37,540
Yeah, there are different rooms that do different things.

3018
03:08:37,720 --> 03:08:39,600
You can see all the items in the house.

3019
03:08:40,580 --> 03:08:42,140
This affects stuff too.

3020
03:08:42,560 --> 03:08:44,640
How do I access the e-mail?

3021
03:08:46,200 --> 03:08:48,520
Tells us how to... OK, I'm going to get the security.

3022
03:08:48,920 --> 03:08:49,480
No, I cannot.

3023
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:53,680
I was going to say, because there is an e-mail that's supposed to come through.

3024
03:08:54,620 --> 03:08:57,760
That will have us... I remember...

3025
03:09:00,200 --> 03:09:01,860
I remember, it said...

3026
03:09:05,780 --> 03:09:06,300
That...

3027
03:09:07,080 --> 03:09:13,840
In the mail room, it was like, oh, an e-mail will come through and it will show you more information about the breaker box.

3028
03:09:14,980 --> 03:09:17,320
We need the login password for the computer!

3029
03:09:19,320 --> 03:09:20,980
Oh my god.

3030
03:09:22,960 --> 03:09:24,240
How do we get that?

3031
03:09:24,860 --> 03:09:25,980
Try the boudoir.

3032
03:09:25,980 --> 03:09:26,140
Boudoir.

3033
03:09:26,700 --> 03:09:27,160
OK.

3034
03:09:31,550 --> 03:09:32,730
Sexy lady room.

3035
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:38,600
I imagine this is the same.

3036
03:09:39,060 --> 03:09:40,240
What if there is an apple in here?

3037
03:09:40,960 --> 03:09:41,380
25.

3038
03:09:49,360 --> 03:09:53,160
This run was so bad because we just kept losing steps and kept...

3039
03:09:53,160 --> 03:09:55,760
This is the one time I have so many jammies, you know?

3040
03:09:56,200 --> 03:09:57,000
Also four.

3041
03:10:01,630 --> 03:10:02,730
Damn, Daniel.

3042
03:10:07,840 --> 03:10:10,200
The one time I... What is this?

3043
03:10:12,200 --> 03:10:16,090
The first time you enter each bedroom with the sleep mask...

3044
03:10:17,100 --> 03:10:18,660
Gain 5 steps?

3045
03:10:22,910 --> 03:10:25,970
Wait, does that mean all of these rooms too?

3046
03:10:29,210 --> 03:10:30,790
Wait, are we so back?

3047
03:10:32,730 --> 03:10:34,050
Or is it bedroom?

3048
03:10:34,470 --> 03:10:35,450
What was it?

3049
03:10:36,370 --> 03:10:37,810
Oh, each bedroom.

3050
03:10:38,030 --> 03:10:38,290
OK.

3051
03:10:38,610 --> 03:10:39,890
Just kidding everybody.

3052
03:10:40,490 --> 03:10:41,410
Just kidding.

3053
03:10:43,030 --> 03:10:44,170
Just kidding.

3054
03:10:44,530 --> 03:10:44,890
Sauna?

3055
03:10:49,340 --> 03:10:52,420
Please, please, please let it work for me!

3056
03:10:52,800 --> 03:10:54,140
What is that?

3057
03:11:00,250 --> 03:11:04,570
What was the key for?

3058
03:11:04,570 --> 03:11:04,730
Four!

3059
03:11:11,050 --> 03:11:13,430
We literally passed out in the sauna.

3060
03:11:13,870 --> 03:11:14,870
We are going to die!

3061
03:11:25,360 --> 03:11:25,840
OK.

3062
03:11:27,360 --> 03:11:28,680
I am going to end it there though.

3063
03:11:28,900 --> 03:11:31,560
Thank you guys for...

3064
03:11:32,340 --> 03:11:33,300
For blueprints.

3065
03:11:33,400 --> 03:11:35,620
This was so interesting.

3066
03:11:37,360 --> 03:11:39,480
It's so... I want to keep playing.

3067
03:11:39,560 --> 03:11:40,260
I'm not going to lie.

3068
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:43,080
So, we will continue.

3069
03:11:44,560 --> 03:11:45,840
Possibly next week.

3070
03:11:47,540 --> 03:11:48,700
Thanks for the stream!

3071
03:11:48,940 --> 03:11:49,620
This game is so much fun.

3072
03:11:49,700 --> 03:11:51,220
I just want to say your voice sound is super good today.

3073
03:11:51,560 --> 03:11:52,280
Hope you're feeling great.

3074
03:11:52,380 --> 03:11:52,580
Thanks!

3075
03:11:54,300 --> 03:11:57,780
Yeah, my voice has been feeling much better lately.

3076
03:11:57,940 --> 03:11:59,220
So I'm very happy about that.

3077
03:11:59,460 --> 03:12:00,900
Yeah, I rested it for a bit.

3078
03:12:02,940 --> 03:12:04,120
It's getting there.

3079
03:12:04,320 --> 03:12:07,280
I actually had to record some stuff today too.

3080
03:12:07,280 --> 03:12:12,740
And I was like... I already had asked for an extension for this stuff to record.

3081
03:12:12,860 --> 03:12:16,160
So I was really happy about it.

3082
03:12:16,960 --> 03:12:18,120
What an interesting game.

3083
03:12:18,180 --> 03:12:18,780
Thanks for the fun stream.

3084
03:12:18,860 --> 03:12:20,460
Thanks, Hikneet!

3085
03:12:21,180 --> 03:12:22,800
Actually, I never heard of this game before today.

3086
03:12:22,840 --> 03:12:23,420
It was really fun.

3087
03:12:23,520 --> 03:12:24,320
Thank you!

3088
03:12:24,480 --> 03:12:24,720
Yeah.

3089
03:12:25,100 --> 03:12:30,600
I was really interested because of how much people were hyping it up.

3090
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:33,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3091
03:12:37,540 --> 03:12:43,160
It just came out though, so maybe you can try.

3092
03:12:43,260 --> 03:12:48,160
Again, since it's like a roguelike, everybody's games are going to be kind of different, which is always fun.

3093
03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:54,560
And I feel like I didn't write enough notes, maybe.

3094
03:12:54,740 --> 03:12:57,220
Everyone's like, I have 10 pages worth of notes.

3095
03:12:58,120 --> 03:13:00,100
I have a half page.

3096
03:13:01,640 --> 03:13:05,360
And a Microsoft notepad.

3097
03:13:10,620 --> 03:13:12,220
You're also using screenshots.

3098
03:13:12,760 --> 03:13:14,020
That's true too.

3099
03:13:16,560 --> 03:13:17,940
That's true too.

3100
03:13:18,100 --> 03:13:20,100
We only did, what, three run-throughs?

3101
03:13:21,280 --> 03:13:25,220
I mean, I got to rank nine.

3102
03:13:26,260 --> 03:13:28,800
I don't want to toot my own horn or anything, but...

3103
03:13:29,800 --> 03:13:32,800
I got to rank nine on my third run.

3104
03:13:37,260 --> 03:13:37,860
Yeah.

3105
03:13:38,880 --> 03:13:40,460
Lots of progress each run.

3106
03:13:40,560 --> 03:13:40,960
Yeah!

3107
03:13:41,720 --> 03:13:42,420
We did good.

3108
03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:44,260
We did good, everybody.

3109
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:45,740
We did good.

3110
03:13:48,020 --> 03:13:49,700
But yeah, I'm going to go.

3111
03:13:50,600 --> 03:13:57,020
And I will see you guys later.

3112
03:13:57,820 --> 03:13:58,140
Yeah.

3113
03:13:59,300 --> 03:14:02,320
There's only one true prince and that's the Prince of Bel-Air.

3114
03:14:03,680 --> 03:14:06,960
In West Philadelphia, born and raised.

3115
03:14:07,500 --> 03:14:10,680
I spent my days...

3116
03:14:11,460 --> 03:14:11,900
Feeble.

3117
03:14:16,510 --> 03:14:17,630
Thank you!

3118
03:14:17,970 --> 03:14:18,810
Have a good night!

3119
03:14:18,990 --> 03:14:19,810
Have a good day!

3120
03:14:20,650 --> 03:14:21,670
Bye bye!

3121
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:22,650
Thanks for watching!

3122
03:14:22,930 --> 03:14:23,610
Itterasshai!

3123
03:14:24,190 --> 03:14:24,810
Thank you!

3124
03:14:25,010 --> 03:14:25,310
Thank you!

3125
03:14:25,390 --> 03:14:25,790
Thank you!

3126
03:14:25,910 --> 03:14:26,430
Bye bye!
