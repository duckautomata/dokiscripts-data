00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,100
That's it, that's it.

00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,520
Okay, okay.

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,560
Hi!

4
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,480
Hello!

00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,580
Welcome back!

6
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,040
Is your throat okay?

7
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:26,920
It's okay.

8
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,340
I think your throat is gone.

9
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,320
It's gone.

10
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,680
Were you screaming today?

11
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,940
Yes, yesterday, every day.

12
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,900
Every day.

13
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,820
Every day.

14
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,680
Yeah, I understand.

Okay, one more time.

Okay, okay.

22
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,140
It's me, I'm Mint.

Okay, here we go.

25
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,040
Hi!

26
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,500

Oh yeah, thank you.

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,860
Please don't log out.

33
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,720
This is now Ayami channel.

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Yeah, sorry.

35
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,060
Okay.

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,040
Hello, I'm 100 years old illustrator and Vtuber and Mint Mama Ayami here.

37
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,620
Welcome!

38
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,260
I'm so sorry my Ayami moving last week.

39
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,360
And my internet so slow, sorry.

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,000
So sorry.

41
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,300
I'm really nervous today, but do our best.

42
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,320
Why nervous?

43
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,240
Because too slow internet.

44
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,660
No, I think it's okay, right?

45
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,180
Everybody?

46
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,240
It's okay?

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,540
Am I kind of surge buffering for you guys?

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,880
If it dies, don't say anything or you'll hurt Ayami Mama's feelings.

49
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,460
My internet, oh yeah.

50
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,000
It's okay.

51
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,780
How about my room?

52
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,780
So small and smelly?

53
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,520
No, smells good.

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,320

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,420

00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,220
I don't know favorites.

60
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,040
Oh, favorites.

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,700

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,040

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,960
I was wearing sandals today.

110
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,580
I'm really shocked.

111
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,880
It's fine in the afternoon.

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,660

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,900

141
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,940
Fashionable.

142
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,680
Fashionable...

143
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:21,760
No.

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,300
Fashionable.

145
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,520
No shoes.

146
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,600
At first.

147
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,540
I didn't know it was socks.

148
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,660
Oh, she didn't realize I was wearing socks.

149
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,840
And she thought I was just wearing, like, really fashionable shoes.

150
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,160
Shoes.

151
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,600

152
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,100
No, no, there is socks.

What are you doing?

154
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,600
Too cold.

155
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,820
She thought that it was so cold that I wouldn't be wearing...

156
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,680
Oh, my God.

157
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,980
Why you...

158
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,580
You guys, what are you doing?

159
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,980
Me too...

160
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,880
Too cold winter...

161
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,740
Winter no shoes.

162
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,660
It's Haru.

163
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,060
It's spring.

164
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,860
No, no, no, no, no.

165
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,500
Snowing, but Mint only wearing her socks.

166
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,200
Yeah, really was snowing.

167
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:07,600
Oh, no.

168
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,560
It was snowing so much.

169
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,900
Two days ago.

170
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,640
Yeah, I'm really got shock.

171
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,580
Oh, Mint.

172
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,260
I understand she's ghost and she cannot...

173
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,520
Feeling the weather?

174
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,280
The snow.

175
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,320
It's true.

176
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,840
Not true.

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,380
Not true.

178
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,360
Very cold.

179
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

180
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,780
Please wake up.

181
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,560
You ghost.

182
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,680
Wake up, Mint.

183
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,940
Please wake up.

184
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,520
Fashion is suffering.

185
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,860
Oh, yeah.

186
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,840
I know, yeah.

187
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:58,980
Yesterday in my stream, I'm told that three days ago, the snowing day, I'm asking to you, Mint, you want my North Face parka?

188
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,940
Mint saying, no.

189
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,380
Mint saying, really, really fast speed, no.

190
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,440
Really bad girl, bad daughter.

191
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,000
So you are saying, it's just how I talk.

192
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,240
Mint just wearing cute thing.

193
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,360
My North Face is...

194
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,820
My brain is ojisan.

195
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,260
Fashion is cute brain ojisan.

196
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
Wow, really.

197
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,700
Please buying.

198
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,720
I have.

199
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,540
No.

200
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,240
Yes.

201
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,160
But...

202
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,420
No.

203
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,940
To bring to Japan, so much room in my suitcase.

204
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,040
So...

205
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,260
I don't want to.

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,760
Also...

207
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,140
It's colder than I thought it would be.

208
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,180
I think ghosts don't need clothes, isn't it?

209
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,960
Naked is best.

210
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,840
I think naked is best for ghosts.

211
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,060
Next outfit.

212
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,220

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,580

Can I...

216
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,080
Can I...

217
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,680
No work.

218
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,600
No work.

219
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,460
No work.

220
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,860

221
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,400

226
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,360

227
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,220

229
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,420

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,920
Why you nervous?

265
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,800

266
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,680
Don't look at me!

267
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,920

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,040
Stinky.

300
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,240
How do you say that?

301
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,980
Under the sink?

302
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:36,860
Water.

303
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,880

She's having this issue with her new apartment that...

307
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,680
In her sink, like...

308
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,640
From the faucet, it's a weird smell.

309
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,740
Stinky.

310
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,320
Don't worry.

311
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
Mint not smelly.

312
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,100
It's okay.

313
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,380
I don't live here.

314
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,520
So scary, but...

315
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,440

Yeah, I know.

339
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,840
And everybody who is going...

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,280
Buy lots of stuff and then...

342
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,640

That is my dream.

353
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,900
I don't want to drink.

354
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,820
I don't want to drink.

355
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,360

393
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,080
Everybody wants to know.

394
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,720
What?

395
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,400
Do you know?

396
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,700
Will there be international shipping?

397
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,840
For the goods.

399
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,380
That's right.

400
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,040
From Asan.

401
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,940
Yes, yes.

402
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:35,700
That's right.

403
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,620
They'll do it.

404
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,280
That's right.

405
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,200
They'll do it.

406
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,780
They did it before.

407
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,620
Oh, really?

408
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,880
That's right.

409
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,660
But...

410
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,240
That's right.

411
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,700
It's like buying it at a booth.

412
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:48,740
Ah.

413
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,720
You can buy it there.

414
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,220
If you buy it at Asan's booth or website, you can send it to your country.

415
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,820
If you use that, you can do it.

416
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,700
I can do it.

417
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,260
I can do it.

418
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,740
I can do it.

419
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,060
So it's kind of like...

420
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,040
It's not booth, but I guess it's Asan's cafe.

421
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:08,960
It's not booth.

422
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,720
Asan has a website and a booth.

423
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,680
Oh, booth.

424
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,720
Oh, so they do have a booth.

425
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,280
So, they have a site and they also have a booth.

426
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,960
So there will be shipping for...

427
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,200
Yeah.

428
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,040
International goods!

429
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,300
You can get the goods!

430
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,960
Yay!

431
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,640
I'm glad.

432
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,380
Oh, I think everybody was so worried about that.

433
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,220
But I...

434
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,720
Sometimes my dream, I think about...

435
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,920
Oh, me too...

436
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,800
Made cafe in America.

437
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,520
Oh.

438
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,300
I think that is really good for you and for me.

439
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,800
I want open mint-made cafe, but...

440
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,580
America is too big.

441
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,340
Too big, yeah.

442
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,060
If...

443
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,240
If open New York, but...

444
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,760
Can not go in.

445
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,460
Can not go in.

446
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,420
Too far, huh?

447
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,220
It's too far.

448
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,300
Yeah, I realize...

449
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,820
Japan, America, not different.

450
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,940
Not so many different, isn't it?

451
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,140
Oh, too big country.

452
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,160
Oh, Europe.

453
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,380

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,120
This is just monitor.

512
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,620

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,540
I know, yeah.

587
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,420
It was like one hour of us signing these shikishi.

588
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

589
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,920
So...

590
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,520
You know.

591
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,220
There are many of them.

592
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,240
Many, many, many.

593
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,500
Your sign too cute.

594
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,220

595
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:20,860
No?

596
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,380
Yes.

597
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,740
Yes.

598
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,120
Why you...

599
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,280
Why you...

600
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,160
I'm saying something.

601
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,000
Me to say everything no.

602
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,860
Borrowing...

603
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,940

607
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,840
Before the stream, I say...

608
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,440
You need water?

609
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,240
You say no.

610
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,840
But you drinking...

611
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,500
You drinking water now?

612
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,040
What are you doing?

613
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,280
You...

614
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,400
Why you saying already no?

615
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,460
You hate me?

616
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,100
No.

617
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,540
Mint hates me.

618
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,320
Mint hates us.

619
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,140
Oh my god.

620
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:51,820
Mint hates us.

621
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,880
She hates us.

622
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,980
She hates us.

623
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,660
Yes, we know.

624
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,860
Mint hates us.

625
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,240
Yes.

626
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,460
That is true.

627
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,620
Ayami mama.

628
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,840
Mama doesn't matter.

629
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,840
She hates us.

630
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:03,660
Yes.

631
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,000
No, shut up everybody.

632
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,520
Shut up.

633
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,020
Shut up.

634
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,420
Shut up.

635
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,880
Go home.

636
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,840
Go home.

637
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,540

00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,240
You can see of the...

641
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,700
Hakuriru stand.

642
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,400
Cute.

643
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,560
Look it.

644
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,040

645
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,640
The...

646
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,340
The...

647
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:29,940
These...

648
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,380
These...

649
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,400
The...

650
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,880
The badges.

651
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,740
The badges.

652
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,040
These are actually in a gacha machine.

653
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:36,620
Yeah.

654
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,680
But...

655
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,580
But...

656
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,300
There is a special thing.

657
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:41,860
Because...

658
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,840
Some of them are signed.

659
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,920
There are even more signed things.

660
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,560
Right?

661
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,300
Right?

662
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,740
Can badges.

663
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,740
So those are also...

664
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,240
There is also winnings with those as well.

665
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,140
So...

666
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,660
You can also maybe get a special signed version.

667
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:57,700
Yeah.

668
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,400

00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,620

670
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,220

671
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,900
This is about 1 out of 3.

672
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,240
This amount is about 1 out of 3.

673
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,620
30% take pictures.

674
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,620
We have more and more signed.

675
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,380
Some are just me and some are both of us.

676
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:27,780
Yeah.

677
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,140

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,980

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,940
Cute.

680
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,400
It was so fun.

681
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,900
Look, look, look.

682
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,540

685
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay, everybody.

686
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,020
And then, of course, the Shikishi.

687
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,240
Signed Shikishi.

688
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,480
This is also really...

689
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,900
1 out of 3.

690
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,080
30% Really, really so...

691
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,520
We signed so many.

692
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,680
So many of them.

693
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,840
I'm a little nervous.

694
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,260
I was asking to A-san...

695
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:32,410
Yeah, just so many...

696
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,330
It's okay to have this many, honestly.

697
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,630
But we really many signed.

698
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,670
We did.

699
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,500
And please get our signed.

700
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,610
Yeah, yeah.

701
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,470
Your signed cute.

702
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,330
Your signed cute.

703
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,470
The marker was so thick.

704
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,470
It's difficult.

705
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,390
And she...

706
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,970
Mint a little late.

707
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,110
I mean, don't sign.

708
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,010
You are professional.

709
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:03,930
No, no, no.

710
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,770
You are professional.

711
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,870
I mean, don't sign.

712
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,250
But Mint left almost 5, 5 or 6.

713
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,690
I mean, waiting Mint.

714
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,470
I was a little...

715
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,310
You know, behind.

716
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,350
But she signs these all the time.

717
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,630
My sign is simple.

718
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:19,930
Me too.

719
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,830
Yes.

720
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:21,490
Yes.

721
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,090
But there is lots of these and they are all decorated very much.

722
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,130
So, I think the more I sign, the more I decorate.

723
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,410
So, first it was very simple and then...

724
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:35,950
Write more.

725
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,130
And then write more.

726
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,470
Purikura, purikura time.

727
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,190
Yes, yes, yes.

728
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,510

729
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,150
Everyone, please get it.

730
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:44,950
Everyone.

731
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,770
What else?

732
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:47,690
Oh, yes.

733
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:48,890

734
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,210
This one.

735
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,470
Yes.

736
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,510
There will be a...

737
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,470
Yes, it's Rakugaki-cho, but please write...

738
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,490
What is this in English?

739
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,190
What?

740
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,590
Like a...

741
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,330
What's it called?

742
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:03,850
Rolling paper.

743
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:04,470
What?

744
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,290
It's not rolling paper.

745
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,510
It's like a...

746
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,870

747
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,550

749
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,810

752
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,450
Guestbook.

753
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,070
Guestbook, guestbook, guestbook.

754
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:18,970
Yesterday...

755
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,610
Two days ago, I'm asking you...

756
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,310
What is this?

757
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:22,970
You...

758
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,070

759
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,350

Me too.

761
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,810
I couldn't remember for two days.

762
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,110
We talk about that.

763
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,190
Sunny side up.

764
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,650
Yeah, yeah.

765
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,350
I couldn't remember.

766
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,890
I did it.

767
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,630

774
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:47,950

775
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,930
This egg...

776
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,770

779
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,570

Come here.

781
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,090
I think she came to Japan.

782
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,870
She forgot English.

783
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,750
And Japanese.

784
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,370
What?

785
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,070
What?

786
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,430
She can say zero.

787
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:09,990
Zero, yeah.

788
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,570
Zero country.

789
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:11,810
And back to baby.

790
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,270
Oh, that's really cute.

791
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,570
Cute.

792
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,230
Oh,

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,350

794
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,230
No, I don't think so.

795
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,710
They're brushing.

796
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,650
You guys are too pure.

797
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,810
Stop it.

798
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,090
Stop it, everybody.

799
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,810

00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:48,450
We're checking.

803
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,630
We will write it.

804
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,250
Don't write anything weird.

805
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,630
Can I write something weird?

806
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,130
Mint boobs are small.

807
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,270
That's...

808
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,550
Mint pattern.

809
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,170
It's good.

810
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:06,790
Okay.

811
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,290
It's okay until mint pattern, right?

812
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,830
Derek, mint pattern.

813
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,370
Mint small boobs.

814
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,650
Mint...

815
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,450
Small.

816
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:14,970
You're saying too much.

817
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,510
Mint...

818
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,210
Nothing.

819
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,850
Mint has nothing.

820
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,110
Mint...

821
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,150
What else is there?

822
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,070
Mint cute.

823
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,070
Everybody will know, right?

824
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,550
Every page you write.

825
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,510
Mint pattern.

826
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,410
Mint pattern.

827
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,090
It was fun and delicious.

828
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,510
And mint pattern.

829
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,190
Every comment will be like, I had so much fun.

830
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:42,910
It was so yummy.

831
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,490
Also, mint is flat.

832
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:45,870
Finally...

833
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,070
Best part is mint pattern.

834
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,050
Derek is happy.

835
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,050
Please write many things.

836
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,230
Yes, please.

837
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,450
Please, please, please.

838
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,790
Okay.

839
00:27:59,210 --> 00:27:59,770
What else?

840
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,450
What is this?

841
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,170
I wrote this.

842
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,610
I wrote this.

843
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,790
We also wrote some other...

844
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:07,910
What?

845
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,270
Why is mine in the front?

846
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:10,950
This...

847
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,870
This...

848
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,710
I think it's better to put it in the front.

849
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:15,850
Really?

850
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,890
Oh my god.

You...

853
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,470
We made also some shikishu that will be hung up on the wall.

854
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,810
I was saying that...

855
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,890
Why did she hide?

856
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,670
No, you hide.

857
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,750
This is your hand.

858
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,450
Yeah, this is my hand.

859
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,450

Yeah.

870
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,330

00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,690
You can see how small you are next to us.

936
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:58,590
Because...

937
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,350
I think...

938
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,950
I mean, remember...

939
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,430
Mint?

940
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,490
Mint-chan was standing next to you.

941
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:09,130
Mint standing beside your standee.

942
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:10,990

943
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:11,470
Really?

944
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,410
Mint-chan was standing next to you.

945
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,330
And you were a little big.

946
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,270
Me?

947
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,170
Yeah, at first.

948
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,930
And Mint-chan was like, Oh, I'm big.

949
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,430
What should I do?

950
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,110
And she took off her shoes.

951
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,630
She took off her shoes.

952
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,890
And she was like, Oh, we're the same.

953
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,590
And when she took off her shoes, I was like, Oh, that's it.

954
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,650
Your shoes are 30cm.

955
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,090
30cm.

956
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,070
Mint shoes.

957
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,650
30cm higher.

958
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,970
I was standing next to my standee at first.

959
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,030
She was like, Oh, the mint is actually taller than it.

960
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:44,870
Than the standee.

961
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,570
And then I took off my shoes because they're kind of platforms.

962
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,550
And she was like, She's actually the same size.

963
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,570
That's good.

964
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,050
I'm really shocked.

965
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,270

00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,330
Thick.

970
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,630
Sometimes, some dangerous time, we can using the shoes.

971
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:13,970
Some dangerous time.

972
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:14,250

973
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:14,910

974
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,810
We can using weapon.

975
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:17,830
It's not that dangerous.

976
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,890
I think it's...

977
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:26,320
I think this is really good because this time, the print is really good.

978
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,370
I'm really happy.

979
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,250
It looks so good.

980
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,630
Happy.

981
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,350
Everybody take lots of photos with it.

982
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:35,610
Okay.

983
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,050
You're so cute.

984
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,270
You're so cute.

985
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,150
Oh, thank you.

986
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,010
Oh, thank you.

987
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:44,850
I'm drawing.

988
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,370
But this time, I'm really...

989
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,510
This time, really difficult.

990
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:57,700
When I drawing Mint and Ayami, collaboration, cafe, illustrations, that time...

991
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:06,530
Most difficult part is...

992
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,730
I think...

993
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,890
My image.

994
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:09,510
Mint.

995
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,390
My image of Mint and...

996
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,610
How can I say?

997
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,750
My fan's image of Mint.

998
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,210
I think it's a little different.

999
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,030
I wanted to draw Mint that my fan said it's cute.

1000
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:35,770
I want Mint's fan see my illustration and they are happy.

1001
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:40,770
But when I drawing time, just to focus...

1002
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,010
Love Mint.

1003
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,010
I cannot think of sometimes your fans.

1004
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,850
Just think about my feeling.

1005
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,710
My feeling.

1006
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,450
Love Mint.

1007
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,190
Love Mint.

1008
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,550
I love you.

1009
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,530
Love Mint.

1010
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,390
And drawing hard.

1011
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,940
Finish illustration.

1012
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,250
I'm a little...

1013
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,310
I mean...

1014
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,210
How can I say?

1015
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,090
Reflection.

1016
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,870
How can I say in English?

1017
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,850
I mean...

1018
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,450
I'm like that.

1019
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,050
After finishing work, I have to draw like this again.

1020
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,770
Oh, like...

1021
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,550
How can I say?

1022
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,550
English.

1023
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,410
English.

1024
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,530
English.

1025
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:30,050
Please look it up.

1026
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,630
I mean...

1027
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,050
I mean...

1028
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,050
I mean more...

1029
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,010
Drawing...

1030
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,230
For fans...

1031
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,290
Fans...

1032
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,330
Fans...

1033
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,750
Fans...

1034
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,190
English.

1035
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,230
Okay, so...

1036
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,530
Basically, when she's drawing sometimes, she's just like...

1037
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,410
She's not really thinking of your perception...

1038
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,030
Your opinions.

1039
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,650
She's thinking like...

1040
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,350
I want to...

1041
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:08,890
I just am thinking of drawing how much I love Mint.

1042
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,030
Yeah.

1043
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,210
And so...

1044
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,510
And so, I guess...

1045
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,690
How is it different though?

1046
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,250
But don't you...

1047
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:34,450
She doesn't want to just draw the Mint that she loves, but also the one that everybody loves.

1048
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,010
But...

1049
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,990
Well,

1050
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,930
sometimes I'm drawing ugly Mint.

1051
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,090
But that is my drawing.

1052
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,090
And I like my drawing.

1053
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,370
There's no ugly.

1054
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,110
There's no ugly.

1055
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,190
No, no, no.

1056
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,950
Sometimes, sometimes.

1057
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,490
I mean really...

1058
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,230
So many times...

1059
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,330
Drawing again...

1060
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,050
Surgery.

1061
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,410
Mint face surgery.

1062
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,630
Oh, I'm getting plastic surgery.

1063
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,610
Plastic surgery Mint.

1064
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,730
Mint more...

1065
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,150
Cute...

1066
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,470
Cute eyes Mint.

1067
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,830
I mean make Mint every time.

1068
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,330
That's funny.

1069
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,680
Yeah, she says that she has to like...

1070
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,050
Reflect on it.

1071
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,350
Kind of like...

1072
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,130
She has to really like...

1073
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:22,680
Kind of...

1074
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:23,870
Look back on it.

1075
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,490
Be like...

1076
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:29,630
This is so cute.

1077
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,270
Right, everybody?

1078
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,110
You think the...

1079
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,630
The illustrations...

1080
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,710
Oh, the illustrations for the cafe are so cute.

1081
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,070
Right?

1082
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,270
Look, look.

1083
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,050
But there is a twin tail.

1084
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,330
Oh, you can see here.

1085
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,230
Twin tail.

1086
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,710
Kawaii.

1087
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,490
Really kawaii.

1088
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:03,910
Really.

1089
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,350
Thank you.

1090
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,610
Thank you, Celia-san.

1091
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,770
Thank you, Celia-mama.

1092
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,670
Celia-papa.

1093
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,290
Celia-papa is really a genius.

1094
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,070
Yes, a genius.

1095
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,490
And...

1096
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,450
Oh, this too.

1097
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,830
Another preview of some of the food.

1098
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,150
Which one could be it?

1099
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,570
This is really delicious.

1100
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,790
This is...

1101
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,530
Yeah, this is actually so delicious, you guys.

1102
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,310
Really yummy.

1103
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:39,950
Really, really.

1104
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,270
It's actually so yummy.

1105
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,630
Wow, this is really fantastic.

1106
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,470
I really like this.

1107
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,890
This is my special omurice.

1108
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,290
I will make you curse though, so...

1109
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,710
They don't know this love.

1110
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,590
No, no, no.

1111
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:58,690
Wow.

1112
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,530
A little spoil.

1113
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,090
Okay.

1114
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:09,610
The first time Mint and I made a food idea, Mint sent me this omurice and compote.

1115
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,830
She drew it.

1116
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,390
At that time, I first saw that picture.

1117
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,150
I mean...

1118
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,090
First, my opinion...

1119
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,350
A little...

1120
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,030
Disgusting.

1121
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,930
Because it's not yellow.

1122
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,450
Almost everything is white.

1123
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,770
It's yellow.

1124
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:30,370
No, no.

1125
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:35,590
Omurice is yellow, but that compote is almost gray.

1126
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,510
Gray color, not yellow.

1127
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,910
I'm sorry.

1128
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,470
I mean, first time...

1129
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,210
Check that image.

1130
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,410
I'm really shocked.

1131
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,790
Got shocked, but...

1132
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,370
I cannot say because...

1133
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,470
She really thinks about menu and she loves...

1134
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,190
You should say!

1135
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:52,870
But...

1136
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,150
I mean, never...

1137
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,410
I have been...

1138
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,030
I've never eaten it.

1139
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,030
She's never tried it before.

1140
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:58,510
Oh, yeah.

1141
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,950
This omurice with compote.

1142
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,670
I cannot say anything.

1143
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,230
And I'm really nervous.

1144
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,550
Before the real food...

1145
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,770
I mean, met real food.

1146
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,570
Before the...

1147
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,850
But finally, finally...

1148
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,810
Asa made this.

1149
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:14,570
And I'm...

1150
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,210
Wow!

1151
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,990
This is it!

1152
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:17,710
What?

1153
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,310
What?

1154
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,510
This is really...

1155
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,650
Hot, hot.

1156
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,390
Really...

1157
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:23,970
Really good.

1158
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,890
Wow, amazing.

1159
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,310
Wow.

1160
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,490
Thank you, Asa.

1161
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,490
I'm so sorry.

1162
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,230
First time I saw...

1163
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,970
Your laugh and think about that.

1164
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:33,730
It's okay.

1165
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,510
It's okay.

1166
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,330
I really want to...

1167
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,310
Showing that...

1168
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,690
The laugh.

1169
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,270
It's my color.

1170
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,350
I didn't...

1171
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,310
I didn't choose yellow because...

1172
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,050
The omurice is yellow.

1173
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,410
Only yellow.

1174
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,350
That is really...

1175
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,830
White and gray.

1176
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:54,970
What did you do?

1177
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,030
Someone threw up?

1178
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,050
Omurice.

1179
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,270
Oh, wow.

1180
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,090
This is...

1181
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:00,890
What is this?

1182
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,090
If she write...

1183
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,330
The right...

1184
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,750
Text...

1185
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,510
That...

1186
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,050
Comportage.

1187
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:06,930
But...

1188
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,630
I cannot believe.

1189
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,630
Yeah.

1190
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,150
I even wrote that it's corn soup.

1191
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:11,910
But she...

1192
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,970
But I cannot...

1193
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:13,730
I cannot believe.

1194
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,470
Wow, this color is not corn soup.

1195
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,510
What is this?

1196
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,410
It's corn soup.

1197
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:18,930
No.

1198
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,270
But finally...

1199
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,030

1204
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:26,890
Yummy things.

1205
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,410
It's really good and it's big.

1206
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,590
Big, big.

1207
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,390
Really big for you.

1208
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,130
It's really big size.

1209
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,930
Please introduce my drawing.

1210
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:37,490
What is this?

1211
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,210
That...

1212
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,090
Food sheet.

1213
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:40,390
This?

1214
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:40,670
Yeah.

1215
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,950
So...

1216
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,510
Say that.

1217
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,150
Say it.

1218
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,830
I got a little busy.

1219
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,510
And...

1220
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,210
She broke me again.

1221
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:52,550
No.

1222
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,450
Wow.

1223
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,110
She broke me again.

1224
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,090
I think she...

1225
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,150
Block this code.

1226
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,010
And...

1227
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,150
She line...

1228
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,950
Block one day.

1229
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:01,390
No, no, no.

1230
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:01,930
Just one day.

1231
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,490
Block again.

1232
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,750
She was sending me the stuff to check.

1233
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:06,870
The...

1234
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,450
The...

1235
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,410
The...

1236
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,730
The...

1237
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,490
Sample food.

1238
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,690
That they first created.

1239
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,240
And...

1240
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,030
I said it's good.

1241
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:15,550
But...

1242
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,550
It's because...

1243
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,010
She had to draw the...

1244
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:19,350
The...

1245
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:19,850
So...

1246
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,990
But it looks exactly like...

1247
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,890
The original I drew.

1248
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1249
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,090
Because I mean...

1250
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,830
Oh, trace?

1251
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,410
Yeah.

1252
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,210
You're drawing to trace.

1253
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,750
Trace.

1254
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:33,450

1255
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,910
Just I mean drawing heart.

1256
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,890
She had to trace my drawing.

1257
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,270
Please don't block me.

1258
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,630
Please.

1259
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,950
One year...

1260
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,210

00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,210

00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,010
Really good drawing.

1344
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:23,510
I drew this on the train going back from Akihabara.

1345
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,350
And I drew it on my phone.

1346
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,070
So, everybody...

00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,750
Too many snow, too cold.

1353
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:41,770

00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,450
Okay,

00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,530
Please check time.

1395
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,870
Just don't go at like 9am.

1396
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:42,550
You won't.

1397
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,670
You can't be there unless you're lining up.

1398
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,350
Yeah, don't be, don't catch a cold.

1399
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:49,630
Yeah.

1400
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:57,070
Before the stream, we studied English time.

1401
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:02,650
I mean, I want to say, because my cat Poo caught a cold.

1402
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,610
But I mean, I want to say to Mint, Poo catch a cold.

1403
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,110
Catch cold, got cold.

1404
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,350
Something, something cold, Mint say.

1405
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,790
Caught, because the pest, pest thing, caught a cold.

1406
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,810
Okay, English.

1407

This is really simple.

1412
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,870
She liar, because she cannot say English.

1413
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:41,530
Yes, true.

1414
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:42,690
She teaching English?

1415
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:44,290
It's true.

1416
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:49,370
Okay, you're really really good teaching, because I understand.

1417
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:51,650
But that time, nobody learns anything.

1418
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,050
And when I teach them, they don't remember.

1419
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:54,930
Just talking.

1420
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:56,990
Just talking.

1421
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,390
I'm really surprised.

1422
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,330
Wow, wow, amazing.

1423
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:04,830

00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,270
Please check the map.

1426
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:11,730

1427
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:12,710
Yes.

1428
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,370
Is the sound okay?

1429
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:15,350
Is the sound loud?

1430
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:16,410
Is it okay?

1431
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,330
I guess we'll check it.

1432
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:21,850
So we have a little preview to show you guys.

1433
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,990
Of some stuff that we recorded.

1434
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,570
That will be playing inside the cafe.

1435
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:37,530
And we will play it and tell us if the audio is okay.

1436
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:39,590

00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,190

00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,210
Okay, so this is like the loading video.

00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,310
I'm just going to skip through it.

1454
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:03,550
Obviously...

1455
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,450
It's really long.

1456
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,110
Two minutes.

1457
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:08,190
Two minutes.

1458
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,210

1459
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:12,670

1460
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:13,630
Okay, we'll skip.

1461
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:14,870
Thank you.

1462
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:16,310
Good timing.

1463
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:18,890
Oh, you died.

1464
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,410

You can see the drinks, but my drink is messed up.

1467
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,650
Oh yeah, so you can see...

1468
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:30,410
That is syrup.

1469
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:31,130
Syrup?

1470
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,390
Oh, yeah.

1471
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,570
It's caramel latte.

1472
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:34,350
Yeah.

1473
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:34,910
Yeah, caramel.

1474
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,310
She first time drink no syrup.

1475
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:43,070
She push push syrup and she messed up my illustration.

1476
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:45,550
Really bad daughter.

1477
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:46,810
Sorry, sorry.

1478
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,010
Whatever, what does it look before?

1479
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:50,670
Yeah.

1480
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:50,930
See?

1481
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,170

1482
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,210

1483
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:00,650

1484
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:01,490
Still dead.

1485
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:02,250
Sorry.

1486
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:02,710
Still dead.

1487
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:03,290
Still dead.

1488
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:05,330
She looks like alive.

1489
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:12,910
Not ectoplasm.

1490
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:14,150
Oh, yes.

1491
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:27,130
Of course, melon soda is really good color for mint, but I'm really...

1492
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:28,110
You cannot drink.

1493
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:28,870
No.

1494
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,790
Yeah, but she make this menu.

1495
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,610
And I'm a little confused.

1496
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,830
But people can drink.

1497
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:38,290
Not me.

1498
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:38,930
It's okay.

1499
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,670
This time drink I'm everything.

1500
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:43,490

00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:46,970
So, yeah.

1502
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,290
It comes with udon.

1503
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:49,830
Yeah.

1504
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:54,970
Udon with... you can get the little cake and the dango and udon.

1505
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:55,550
Yeah.

1506
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:56,770
So it's a little set.

1507
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:57,710
My favorite.

1508
00:51:58,510 --> 00:51:59,110
Oh, really?

1509
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:00,550
What's next?

1510
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,610
Oh!

1511
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,650
I love, love, love.

1512
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:13,770
This is really...

1513
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,530
You can't hear it.

1514
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,310
I'm talking?

1515
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:18,850
Yeah.

1516
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,030
I'm talking.

1517
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,830
She doesn't have headphones on, so she can't hear.

1518
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,590
But I can hear it.

1519
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,590
We're talking about the...

1520
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,550
The mint flavor.

1521
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:34,410
This is not strong mint, really.

1522
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,270
No, it's not really strong mint.

1523
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,410
And really cute.

1524
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,230
The mint color and chocolate.

1525
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,450
It's more milky flavor than mint.

1526
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,510
So if you don't like... even if you don't like mint, maybe you should still try it.

1527
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,070
Yeah, please.

1528
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:50,210
Yeah.

1529
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:51,530
And this...

1530
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,890
Your drink.

1531
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,050
Yeah, my drink.

1532
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,210

00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:55,970

1534
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,150
Fuwa Fuwa love potion.

1535
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:05,170
This is lemon and grapefruit.

1536
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,410
And a little peach.

1537
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:07,550
A little peach.

1538
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:12,710
And this is really sweet and lovely and sexy taste.

1539
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,390
Please try it!

1540
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:16,870
It was delicious.

1541
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,430
Right?

1542
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,250
Yeah, but what the ame?

1543
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:24,790
Yeah, it's like a cocktail, but it has no alcohol in it.

1544
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,130
Ah, that's a mocktail.

1545
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:26,790
Ah, mocktail.

1546
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,110
Yeah, so it's like a cocktail, but it's a mocktail.

1547
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,490
It has no alcohol in it.

1548
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,130
Cotton candy.

1549
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,630
But you can still get litty.

1550
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,370
Got so many sugar.

1551
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,210
You can.

1552
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,450
Yeah, you'll get drunk off sugar.

1553
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:45,530
Dine.

1554
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:46,110
No.

1555
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:49,670
Yeah, so try it.

1556
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,210
Last drop of mint.

1557
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,450
You made a mess.

1558
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,330
Shut up!

1559
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,570
The worst!

1560
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:09,410
No!

1561
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:12,530
There it is.

1562
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,650
You ate it, but it's not cute.

1563
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,490
I want to show you the...

1564
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:17,710
Cute?

1565
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,990
Yeah, that's good.

1566
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,290
Not messed up.

1567
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,630
This is Napolitan.

1568
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,130
I like Napolitan.

1569
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,790
Some sauces.

1570
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,830
Guys, is this sunny side up?

1571
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,750
Yeah, this is sunny side up.

1572
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:36,490
This is sunny side up egg.

1573
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:39,090
This is sunny side up, correct?

1574
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,330
I think, right?

1575
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:40,870
Yes?

1576
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:42,710
No?

1577
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:43,210
Yes?

1578
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,450
Scary.

1579
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,650
Yeah, scary.

1580
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,670
So yummy.

1581
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,930
Napolitan is a little different from spaghetti.

1582
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,730
Because it's...

1583
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:57,110
Ketchup.

1584
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,190
Ketchup taste.

1585
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,870
Ketchup and sausage taste.

1586
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:03,250
But it's yummy.

1587
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,310
Good for health.

1588
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,610
I don't think so.

1589
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:06,630
Shut up!

1590
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,890
Don't bother my selling.

1591
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,270
Don't bother my business, okay?

1592
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,390
Shut up, meat.

1593
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,330
This is my business, okay?

1594
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,750
Please try this.

1595
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:19,270
Please.

1596
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,490
It's good for your health.

1597
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,090
She's 100 years old, she knows.

1598
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:26,110
Yeah, I think this is really good for health.

1599
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,710
Because of pi-mang.

1600
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:28,890
And belly...

1601
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:30,830
The green...

1602
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,010
Green pepper.

1603
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:33,350
Pepper.

1604
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,010
And tomato.

1605
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,970
How you know more English than me?

1606
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,310
I'm good English.

1607
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:39,790
Today.

1608
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,750
Just today.

1609
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:41,990
Really good today.

1610
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:44,930
And...

1611
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:47,990
I think this is really good healthy food, please.

1612
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:48,850
Try this.

1613
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:49,810
Yeah, try it.

1614
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:50,410
Try it.

1615
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,970
And then you saw my omurice.

1616
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:53,670
Really good.

1617
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,530
That's so pretty.

1618
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:54,990
Yeah.

1619
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,050
My drawing is really good.

1620
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:03,490
This was delicious.

1621
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,110
This is really yummy.

1622
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:05,770
Yeah.

1623
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:07,770
My doriya...

1624
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:08,710
Ura...

1625
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:09,790
Ura...

1626
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:10,130
Ura...

1627
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,070
Ura-meshiya.

1628
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:12,530
Doriya-meshiya.

1629
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,970
Doriya-meshiya.

1630
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:15,950
Doriya-meshiya.

1631
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:17,870
This is so good.

1632
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:23,390
It's got like tomatoes and sweet potato and broccoli and ham.

1633
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:24,770
And...

1634
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:25,430
Bacon, bacon.

1635
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:26,370
Bacon, just kidding.

1636
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:26,770
Rice.

1637
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:29,430
Wow.

1638
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,410
Just kidding.

1639
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,230
Using...

1640
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,750
Okay, okay.

1641
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:33,970
I like this.

1642
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,150
Okay, I understand.

1643
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:36,710
Studying English, okay?

1644
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,170
Okay, okay.

1645
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:38,930
What's the...

1646
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:40,770
Hanpen.

1647
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,250
Hanpen, it's like a fish cake.

1648
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,430
Yeah, but almost no taste.

1649
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:45,990
Yeah, yeah.

1650
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,070
It really doesn't have a taste.

1651
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,150
It's kind of like bread almost.

1652
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:54,010
Yeah, almost bread and less calorie.

1653
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:56,630
That is real healthy food.

1654
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:57,010
Yeah, see?

1655
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:00,330
I made something really healthy with lots of vegetables.

1656
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:00,770
Yeah.

1657
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,130
Fish cake.

1658
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:03,250
Hanpen.

1659
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,390
It's Hanpen.

1660
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:05,850
It's Hanpen.

1661
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:06,610
It's Hanpen.

1662
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:07,290
It's Hanpen.

1663
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,910
There is rice underneath.

1664
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:16,690
The cream sauce inside is really rich and creamy.

1665
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:19,350
Rich and creamy cream sauce.

1666
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,750
The sauce was really delicious.

1667
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,610
Really good sauce and hot.

1668
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:26,870
Really hot.

1669
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:29,690
I'm hungry.

1670
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,110
The sauce was so good.

1671
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,830
The cheese was so good.

1672
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:36,490
I think out of everything, I would want to eat this again.

1673
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:36,990
Oh, no.

1674
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,350
I want to eat this again.

1675
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:39,090
Yeah.

1676
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:40,490
I want to eat it.

1677
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,110
I want to eat it.

1678
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:42,450
No, no, no.

1679
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,950
Don't bother my business.

1680
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:45,850
Napolitan.

1681
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,830
Napolitan, try Napolitan.

1682
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:49,910
Napolitan.

1683
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,250
This is really yummy.

1684
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:54,070
Yeah, hot, hot, hot and yummy.

1685
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:54,530
Yeah.

1686
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:56,290
Fish head.

1687
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:57,010
Fish head.

1688
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,250
Healthy food.

1689
00:57:59,410 --> 00:57:59,530
Healthy food.

1690
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,530
This is really healthy.

1691
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,290
It's stringy.

1692
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1693
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:08,230
Nice.

1694
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:11,690
Sorry, sorry.

1695
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:15,130
I pressed the wrong button.

1696
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:16,750
Hey, hey, hey, Mint.

1697
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,630
Seriously, seriously.

1698
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,550
Hey, Mint.

1699
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:20,330
Hey, Mint.

1700
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:23,230
You've been streaming for a few years?

1701
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,970
I think you are a professional VTuber.

1702
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:28,570
I'm professional.

1703
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:29,510
Oh, yeah.

1704
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,830
This is a small mistake.

1705
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,410
Okay, dessert.

1706
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:37,450
We make together dessert.

1707
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:38,930
This is pancake.

1708
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:40,010
Pancake.

1709
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,350
But hot cake.

1710
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:42,690
Souffle hot cake.

1711
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,030
It's like different from a pancake.

1712
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:45,630
Souffle.

1713
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:46,230
Souffle?

1714
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,510
Oh, it's like a souffle?

1715
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,110
Souffle.

1716
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:48,830
English?

1717
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:50,510
Yeah, French.

1718
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,310
French?

1719
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:53,950
Mint Phantom.

1720
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:59,510
Yeah, I like Mint Phantom and souffle cake.

1721
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,790
This is really fluffy.

1722
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:02,290
Fluffy?

1723
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,370
Fluffy.

1724
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:04,730
Fluffy.

1725
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:05,970
Fluffy.

1726
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,570
Fluffy Oppa.

1727
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,790
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1728
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:09,780
Yeah, I like fluffy.

1729
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:16,150
And the cat face, Riff's face is make cream cheese.

1730
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:17,590
Yeah, the cream cheese.

1731
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:18,870
Yeah, and maple syrup.

1732
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:20,830
And fluffy bread.

1733
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,230
Yeah.

1734
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,850
And really good taste.

1735
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,330
It's so good.

1736
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,770
Overweight cat thing.

1737
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:30,350
Minna wakaru.

1738
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,170
Getting overweight.

1739
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:34,070
Sorry.

1740
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,370
Sorry guys.

1741
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:43,910
But this is so lovely one plate because strawberry is pink and mint chocolate is green as our color.

1742
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:44,370
Color.

1743
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,770
Yeah, and this is really, I think...

1744
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,330
The whipped cream.

1745
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:51,390
Like Fuji.

1746
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:52,370
Fuji-san.

1747
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:56,990
That pile of whipped cream is only whipped cream.

1748
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:59,990
Yeah, inside every, no empty place.

1749
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,290
Oh, yeah.

1750
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:02,250
All whipped cream.

1751
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:02,690
Oh, yeah.

1752
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,530
You guys almost dying, I think.

1753
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:07,870
Maybe.

1754
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,010
Real sugar.

1755
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:09,470
Yeah.

1756
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:14,990
But I think this you can eat and walk around Akihabara.

1757
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:15,930
Yeah.

1758
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:16,770
It's good.

1759
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:17,310
Yeah.

1760
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:18,870
No dying, don't worry.

1761
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:19,630
Yeah, don't worry.

1762
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:21,650
Don't worry.

1763
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:22,750
All cream is so delicious.

1764
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,890
It's okay, it's okay.

1765
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,030
It was delicious, right?

1766
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,530
Ice cream.

1767
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,350
Strawberry ice cream was really delicious.

1768
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,130
Strawberry ice cream is really...

1769
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,230
It was really like...

1770
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:33,770
Strong...

1771
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:34,210
Ichigo.

1772
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:35,530
Strong strawberry taste.

1773
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:36,410
Strong ichigo.

1774
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,310
Strong ichigo.

1775
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:41,030
Wow, she's English is something like...

1776
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,650
Yeah.

1777
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,390
She forget everything.

1778
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,950
Okay.

1779
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:48,970
Next.

1780
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,130
She's eating.

1781
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:51,190
She's eating.

1782
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:51,950
She's still eating.

1783
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:53,970
She's eating.

1784
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,010
She's eating.

1785
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:59,070
Your glove is okay.

1786
01:00:59,290 --> 01:00:59,790
It's okay.

1787
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,090
Your glove...

1788
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,350
I don't know your glove is okay or not.

1789
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:05,970
It's okay.

1790
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:07,270
Ta-da.

1791
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:10,010
This is the Nakayoshi parfait.

1792
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:11,430
It's not Nakayoshi.

1793
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:13,030
It's Nakayoshi.

1794
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,910
Good, really.

1795
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,110
Wow, this...

1796
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,350
This is really good.

1797
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,330
Inside matcha.

1798
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:21,690
Yeah.

1799
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:24,490
Green tea cream is...

1800
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,690
Yeah, it's like...

1801
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,790
Adult taste.

1802
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:35,590
Do we have that?

1803
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,210
I think so.

1804
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:39,790
It's more like...

1805
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,330
Full refined palate.

1806
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,930
Mature taste?

1807
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:47,610
Maybe, yeah.

1808
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,050
Oh, yeah.

1809
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,730
Really good taste.

1810
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,570
Not too much...

1811
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:53,230
Sweet.

1812
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:55,510
This is really...

1813
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:56,510
Bittersweet.

1814
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:57,950
So,

1815
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:01,150
yeah.

1816
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,130
It's very...

1817
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,690
Yeah, it's not super duper sweet.

1818
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:05,330
It's like...

1819
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,050
My gloves are so ugly.

1820
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:13,810
Your glove!

1821
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:14,970
Don't...

1822
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:16,450
Everybody don't laugh at them, okay?

1823
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:17,790
Your glove!

1824
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:18,770
But look at...

1825
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:21,830
And also, I thought it might be matcha ice cream.

1826
01:02:21,890 --> 01:02:23,170
But it's actually a matcha cream.

1827
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:23,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1828
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:26,310
But matcha ice cream small...

1829
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,750
And matcha cream mix, mix, mix.

1830
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:28,790
And inside.

1831
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,530
So, yeah.

1832
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,810
It's really nice.

1833
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,290
I'm getting hungry.

1834
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:33,910
I'm starving.

1835
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:34,490
It looks yummy.

1836
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:35,930
Your glove.

1837
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,390
They keep me warm.

1838
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:40,670
It's okay.

1839
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,230
It's okay.

1840
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:42,770
Cute.

1841
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:43,450
Yeah, yeah.

1842
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:44,690
Oishi.

1843
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:47,090
Oishi.

1844
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:47,670
Oishi.

1845
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:48,290
Oishi.

1846
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:50,770
And strawberries in there, too.

1847
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,030
And the cookie.

1848
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,410
And look, the whipped cream has the face.

1849
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:55,270
It's like a ghost.

1850
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:55,710
Yes.

1851
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,930
It looks like a ghost, right?

1852
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:57,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1853
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:59,650
Don't laugh at my dumb hole.

1854
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:00,530
Oh my god.

1855
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:03,070
It's so I can use my phone.

1856
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:14,930
You guys, what are you doing?

1857
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:17,270
Please buy some gloves for me.

1858
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:18,250
It's like a...

1859
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,670
The holes are on purpose.

1860
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:21,350
It's so that you can use it.

1861
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:22,750
You can put your finger out.

1862
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:23,270
No, no, this...

1863
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,450
That is just a whore.

1864
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:25,670
No, no, no, no.

1865
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:27,330
She's using so many.

1866
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:28,130
She...

1867
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,170
No, she...

1868
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:29,750
She's poor.

1869
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:30,590
Soy pobre.

1870
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:31,530
Soy pobre.

1871
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:32,510
I'm not poor.

1872
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:34,490
She's poor and...

1873
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:34,770
No.

1874
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:36,570
Oh, really...

1875
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:37,610
Really...

1876
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:38,410
Really...

1877
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:39,330
Oh, mint.

1878
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:39,890
Mint.

1879
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:43,930
Oh, yeah.

1880
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,110
Took the grass off.

1881
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,790
Yeah, grass.

1882
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:47,950
Oh, you can eat it.

1883
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:48,810
Oh, never mind.

1884
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:49,250
Just kidding.

1885
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,630
So we ate that.

1886
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:53,010
Wow.

1887
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:53,870
It was good.

1888
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:56,830
Is that everything?

1889
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:57,250
OK.

1890
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:58,610
Ending.

1891
01:03:59,390 --> 01:03:59,610
OK.

1892
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,350
She will go.

1893
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:15,430
So go and eat everything everybody.

1894
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,150
I will be there.

1895
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,070
Looks delicious.

1896
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:18,510
Good.

1897
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:19,530
It is delicious.

1898
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:21,990
What is this?

1899
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:22,970
That's right.

1900
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:24,790
Did you get it?

1901
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:25,870
The camera...

1902
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:28,190
The camera is behind you.

1903
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:28,810
Behind?

1904
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,350
The camera...

1905
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:30,610
This?

1906
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:33,810
We have a little thing today.

1907
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:34,150
Try it.

1908
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:37,490
It didn't come out.

1909
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:38,070
It didn't come out.

1910
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:44,750
You can't do it.

1911
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:49,410
Hold on.

1912
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:49,810
Hold on.

1913
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:53,610
We have maybe a little hand camera action real quick.

1914
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,750
One more time.

1915
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:02,530
One more time, OK.

1916
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:06,510
OK.

1917
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:12,710
OK.

01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:22,110
Sorry.

1920
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:30,350
You guys, I'm scared.

1921
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:30,930
I'm scared.

1922
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:34,410
Hold on.

1923
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,590
Was it this?

1924
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:36,330
No.

1925
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:37,910
The camera...

1926
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:39,690
The shape of the camera...

1927
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:40,550
The shape of the camera...

1928
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,530
Sorry, I said it in English.

1929
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:43,790
You can say it in English.

1930
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:45,650
You can't see it.

1931
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:46,050
Why?

1932
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:46,950

01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:12,010
I'm embarrassed.

1947
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:15,030
I put my gloves on too much earlier.

1948
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:16,130

01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,570
They're coming.

2109
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:01,430
She come in Japan and she brain melt, I think.

2110
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:05,050
This is wara natto.

2111
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,350
Kome no...

2112
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:10,650
Kome no kusa.

2113
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,450
It's like a...

2114
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:13,690
Rice.

2115
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:19,580
It's rice grass.

2116
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:20,310
Yeah.

2117
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:21,750
And this is...

2118
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,110
Focus, please.

2119
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:23,990
Natto.

2120
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:25,030
Wow.

2121
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:26,270
But...

2122
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:27,370
It's so smelly.

2123
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,010
It smells so bad.

2124
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:30,130
This is first time.

2125
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:31,010
Me too.

2126
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:31,710
Oh, really?

2127
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:33,630
I always...

2128
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:40,650
But this is by Isetan department store.

2129
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:42,590
It's fancy.

2130
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,970
Yeah, I have chopstick.

2131
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:46,150
Do we?

2132
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,610
You already throw up?

2133
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,000
Okay, okay.

2134
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,180
First, I may eat.

2135
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,020
Tell me.

2136
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,340
Don't worry, don't worry, everyone.

2137
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,060
This is not...

2138
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:13,880
It smells so bad.

2139
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,260
It smells so bad.

2140
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,300
Your feet smell.

2141
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:19,820
This is your feet.

2142
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,680
No, no, no.

2143
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,540
This is your armpit.

2144
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,860
It really does smell like feet.

2145
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,360
This is your armpit smell.

2146
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:24,660
Oh, my God.

2147
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,020
It smells so bad.

2148
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,160
Is it bad?

2149
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:35,980
No.

2150
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:36,500
No?

2151
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,420
Delicious.

2152
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,080
Oh, no, I don't believe.

2153
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,640
I don't believe it.

2154
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,640
This is amazing.

2155
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,100
She's putting soy sauce on it.

2156
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:45,380
Because...

2157
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:51,060
First time people need some soy sauce.

2158
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:51,700
Okay, okay.

2159
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,580
Oh, this is yummy.

2160
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,440
This is...

2161
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,900
If she will not do...

2162
01:13:59,400 --> 01:13:59,960
No!

2163
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,100
When I talk time...

2164
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:10,760
She can smell it.

2165
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:13,460
I'm Kusa.

2166
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,420
That's too much.

2167
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:15,280
Just one.

2168
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,300
Just one.

2169
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:17,880
Just one.

2170
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,420
Just one.

2171
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:19,600
Just one.

2172
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,820
Are you gonna feed it to me?

2173
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:23,300
Yeah.

2174
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,860
Because this is a little scary.

2175
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:26,580
It's scary.

2176
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,260
I'm scared.

2177
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,720
This is for me.

2178
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,400
Just one.

2179
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,460
Just one for me.

2180
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:30,980
Okay.

2181
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,500
You can do it.

2182
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,700
It's not bad.

2183
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:48,620
Oh, no.

2184
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,860
Drink is okay.

2185
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:54,920
Just drink...

2186
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,000
Just eat time is okay, but...

2187
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:57,880
Open...

2188
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,820
Open mouth...

2189
01:14:59,640 --> 01:14:59,880
Kusa.

2190
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,040
It was the aftertaste.

2191
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,040
Not taste.

2192
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,440
This is just smell, isn't it?

2193
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:07,960
No, no, no.

2194
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:08,240
Taste.

2195
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,860
Maybe it's mix.

2196
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,180
Because I smell bad.

2197
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,860
Because it smells bad and...

2198
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:16,960
Also, maybe...

2199
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,700
This is yummy.

2200
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,440
If you like Japan, you must eat this.

2201
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:23,440
No?

2202
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,740
You hate Japan?

2203
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,200
Already?

2204
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,200
I hate Japan.

2205
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,100
Oh, yeah.

2206
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:30,980
Okay.

2207
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,040
Okay.

2208
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:33,320
Okay.

2210
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:42,510

2211
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:46,090
Yeah, this is from Isetan.

2216
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:04,410
Not...

2217
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:04,890
What is that?

2218
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:08,350
The thing to do that.

2219
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:09,710
Mouthwash?

2220
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:10,810
Mouth...

2221
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:12,530
Mouthwash.

2222
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:13,610
Mouthwash.

2223
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:14,070
It's not bath.

2224
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,110
I mean prepare this for you mean.

2225
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:21,770

Oh my god.

2227
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:27,370
Natto after Ichigo is good.

2228
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:28,910
Yeah, palate cleanser.

I mean...

2235
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:45,930
Spending money buying fabric and buying Ichigo.

2236
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:48,010
Wow, just one.

2237
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:49,150
Just one piece?

2238
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:52,570
One piece is just...

2239
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:53,270
It's almost...

2240
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:54,790
It's like 8 dollars for one.

2241
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:56,090
Just one.

2242
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,430
This is cheap thing in there.

2243
01:16:58,830 --> 01:16:59,090
Really?

2244
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:00,290
This is really cheap.

2245
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:01,930
Expensive thing is...

2246
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:03,430
3,000 yen.

2247
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:05,550
3,000 yen?

2248
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:05,950
Yeah.

2249
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:06,590
For one.

2250
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:07,470
Just one.

2251
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:08,450
For one?

2252
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:09,530
It's expensive.

2253
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:11,090
Really expensive but...

2254
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:16,690
I mean can buy this for mint.

2255
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:19,050

Mint-chan is also in there.

2259
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,230
Mint-chan, thank you.

2260
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:26,950
Yes, yes.

2261
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:28,210
I'm also a fanbox member.

2262
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:31,150
I mean give to me too.

2263
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:32,910
It's so big.

2264
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:34,870
This is for you.

2265
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:35,890
Share?

2266
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:36,510
No.

2267
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:37,830
This is just one.

2268
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:38,770
For you.

2269
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:39,550
Are you sure?

2270
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:40,870
Because I have no money.

2271
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,810
I can buy just one.

2272
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:45,390
This is my life.

2273
01:17:45,690 --> 01:17:46,610
Don't worry everyone.

2274
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:47,850
I'm still alive.

2275
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,150
Please try this.

2276
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:55,970
Here everybody.

2277
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:57,170
I'll compare to my hand.

2278
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:59,390
You can see the size.

2279
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:01,510
Can I show it?

2280
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:02,230
It's fine.

2281
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:08,230
Your hand is so small.

2282
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:09,790
Your hand is so small.

2283
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,710
Your hand is so small.

2284
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:14,130
It smells good.

2285
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:15,590
It smells so good.

2286
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:20,430
It smells like natto.

2287
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,130
Natto smell.

2288
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,530
The natto smell is gone.

2289
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:27,890
Now it's Ichigo smell.

2290
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:28,830
Natto smell.

2291
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:30,290
It's really big.

2292
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:34,330
Yummy, yummy.

2293
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,070
She left and she started coughing.

2294
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:41,970
Probably because of the smell of the natto.

2295
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:42,870
Okay.

2296
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:43,810
Itadakimasu.

2297
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,050
It tastes like a strawberry.

2298
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:58,010
So yummy.

2299
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,790
Where did she go?

2300
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,190
I'm all by myself now.

2301
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:08,580
It's delicious.

2302
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,420
It's gone.

2303
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:20,660
She put it in the fridge.

2304
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:21,700
She put the natto in the fridge.

2305
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:22,520
Yeah, because...

2306
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,340
That is too...

2307
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:25,860
Expensive.

2308
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,060
It's very high quality.

2309
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,120
What are you showing this?

2310
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,420
Why are you showing this?

2311
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,180
Your...

2312
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,220
You're erotic.

2313
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:37,860
No!

2314
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,560
You're erotic.

2315
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,380
How is this not erotic?

2316
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:44,220
Everyone look at this and imagine something.

2317
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:45,500
What?

2318
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:47,080
Something weird things.

2319
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,240
What things are you imagining everybody?

2320
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,280
Yeah, I know.

2321
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,700
Everyone imagine something.

2322
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,300
Isn't it?

2323
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,680
Isn't it?

2324
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,260
Isn't it?

2325
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:57,840
No.

2326
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:58,960
No, yes.

2327
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,520
I know you guys.

2328
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,980
You guys think about something, something.

2329
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:04,560
I know.

2330
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,420
I don't think so.

2331
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:07,480
Okay.

2332
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,320
I want to share.

2333
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,360
Indirect kiss?

2334
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:16,980
Yeah.

2335
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:18,500
Can I?

2336
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,620
Can I everyone?

2337
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:20,640
Can I?

2338
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:23,780
You...

2339
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:25,160
You clean?

2340
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:25,920
Yeah.

2341
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:28,280
No, I just ate natto.

2342
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,260
You eat...

2343
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:30,440
Natto.

2344
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:30,920
I ate natto.

2345
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,080
You eat natto.

2346
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:32,460
I'm healthy.

2347
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:33,800
Healthy?

2348
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,660
No, you kusa.

2349
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:35,800
You kusa.

2350
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,460
You eat natto already.

2351
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:39,820
Itadakimasu.

2352
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,720
Everyone is jealous, right?

2353
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,020
No, no, no.

2354
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,100
I think you guys jealous.

2355
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,380
They don't care.

2356
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:47,940
They're jealous because they want to eat strawberry.

2357
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,680
Not indirect kiss?

2358
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:52,120
No, no, no.

2359
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,180
Itadakimasu.

2360
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:54,540
Ah.

2361
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:03,040
It's good.

2362
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:04,200
It's good, right?

2363
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:04,740
What is this?

2364
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,580
What is this?

2365
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:06,940
It's good.

2366
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:07,700
Eh?

2367
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,360
No way.

2368
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:11,280
Eh?

2369
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:12,520
What is this?

2370
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:13,460
It's good.

2371
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:13,940
Right?

2372
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,180
It's really...

2373
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:16,160
Refreshing?

2374
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,320
It's not sour.

2375
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:18,860
It's not sour.

2376
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:19,820
It's sweet.

2377
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,220
It's just a sweetie.

2378
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,080
It's like a...

2379
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,360
Yeah, very...

2380
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,620
Not very sour.

2381
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,220
It's very like...

2382
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:26,620
That...

2383
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:28,820
She ate it all.

2384
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:35,410
Yummy.

2385
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:41,010
I ate 900 yen.

2386
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:42,550
Because it's 100 yen.

2387
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:46,010
Just 100 yen eat meat.

2388
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:48,170
900 yen.

2389
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:49,190
Yeah, I am sorry.

2390
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:51,170
Yeah, the thing was 1000 yen.

2391
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:52,590
No, this is for you.

2392
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:53,650
Only for you.

2393
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:54,030
Yay, competition.

2394
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:57,190
Yeah, she ate...

2395
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:02,350
Of the 1000 yen that the strawberry cost, she ate 900 yen and I had 100 yen.

2396
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,230
So sorry, you guys.

2397
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:07,410
Oh my god.

2398
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:08,730
Was it worth?

2399
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:09,350
It was good.

2400
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:10,250
It was good.

2401
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:11,190
With this color...

2402
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:14,170
The price...

2403
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:15,630
But...

2404
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:18,350
Check price and...

2405
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,030
Brain...

2406
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,850
Brain...

2407
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:20,390
How should I say it?

2408
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:21,490
I feel like it's good.

2409
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:22,930
But it's good.

2410
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:23,350
Right?

2411
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:24,210
It's good.

2412
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:25,490
The texture is also good.

2413
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:26,170
It's crispy.

2414
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:27,510
It's good.

2415
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:31,850
It's good.

2416
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:34,550
I'm sorry I ate it all.

2417
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:38,070
I will eat natto later.

2418
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:41,610
After stream, we share natto again.

2419
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:44,750
I don't come back to Japan.

2420
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:48,290
I mean, put in Mint's bag.

2421
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:49,090
Natto.

2422
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,890
And she...

2423
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:53,210
Bag she saw that time train.

2424
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:53,950
Kusa.

2425
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:56,550
Subway, everyone.

2426
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:57,330
What's smell?

2427
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:57,850
What's smell?

2428
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:58,430
Her feet.

2429
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:00,510
Her feet.

2430
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:02,050
Kusa.

2431
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:02,670
Kusa.

2432
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:05,190
So sorry.

2433
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:05,630
Natto.

2434
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:06,530
I did my best.

2435
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:07,450
I did my best.

2436
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:08,150
How was it?

2437
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:09,890
You don't want to eat it again?

2438
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:11,790
Never try again?

2439
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:13,310
Maybe cheap.

2440
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:14,630
Maybe inexpensive.

2441
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:16,510
One.

2442
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:17,170
Maybe.

2443
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:19,150
Maybe natto roll.

2444
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:21,850
Natto roll is fine.

2445
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,130
I will make it now.

2446
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:26,730
I can make natto roll.

2447
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:27,190
No.

2448
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,350
Stop saying feet.

2449
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:34,590
Yes, so...

2450
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:47,050
So you really don't come back?

2451
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,430
Never come again?

2452
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:50,210
I don't think about it.

2453
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:51,210
Oh yeah, sorry.

2454
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:56,250
I mean, kill every natto in Japan.

2455
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:57,210
Don't worry.

2456
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:58,330
Please come again.

2457
01:23:58,330 --> 01:24:03,390
And everybody go to the cafe, there is no natto.

2458
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:05,310
So it smells good in there.

2459
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:06,490
Yeah, really good.

2460
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,670

Not third time in total.

Thank you everybody for coming to watch the stream.

2487
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,750
Maybe some of you are not in Japan.

2488
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:45,810
But thanks for watching anyway.

2489
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:52,450
And hopefully next time we can do another collaboration cafe together.

2490
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:55,570
And everybody else will be able to come again.

2491
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:56,310

01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:08,670
I have to go home.

2499
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,770
You go home?

2500
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:11,930
Oh, I'm lonely.

2507
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,150
Forgot was because I'm 100.

2508
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,590
I just want to say...

2509
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:44,650
Waiting mint a little longer.

2510
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,670
Mint back.
