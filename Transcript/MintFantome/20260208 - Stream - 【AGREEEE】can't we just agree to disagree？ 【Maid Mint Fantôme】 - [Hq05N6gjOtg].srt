1
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:24,960
Oh my gosh, doki, doki, action game!

2
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,080
I'm so excited!

3
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,420
It's Minky.

4
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,600
That's me!

5
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,560
Hi, Minto!

6
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,280
Hello!

7
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,380
Good luck, Minto!

8
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,660
Thank you!

9
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,440
Hello!

10
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,160
Hi, hi, hi!

11
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,920
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

12
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,560
The song is a jam, though.

13
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,380
Maybe by the end of this though, I will hate it.

14
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,180
Interesting to see how we incorporate cannibalism into this
game.

15
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,540
If I lose, I will eat my foot.

16
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,520
Is it cannibalism if you eat yourself?

17
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,000
Self-cannibalism.

18
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,300
Self-cannibalism.

19
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,660
I agreed to let Minto haunt me forever.

20
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,480
Thank you, thank you.

21
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,920
Hello, Minto, and I booze like you.

22
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,820
Okay, real talk.

23
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,000
Have you ever actually read the terms and conditions once?

24
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,640
Can't say I ever have, but mad respect to anyone who did.

25
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:33,740
I...

26
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,400
Auto-cannibalism is a thing, yes.

27
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,640
Oh, baby, oh, baby.

28
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,480
I did once.

29
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,360
I was really bored.

30
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,800
I think, okay, it depends, though.

31
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:58,800
the terms of terms of service for you know because like I
can't believe it's been 13 months already thank you about

32
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:09,240
snacks thank you like a gym membership okay I tried once for
Apple I gave up that's yeah see like some of them are like

33
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:21,700
not as long but some of them are gonna be like insanely long
no but you know I give major respect to anybody that does

34
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,920
read them and then reports about when there's something
strange in there.

35
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,620
You know what I mean?

36
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,420
Somebody has to do it.

37
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,320
Can we all agree that Minto is pretty neat?

38
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,020
Agree, agree, agree.

39
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,020
It's somebody's job to read through like the terms of
services that get put out and be like, hey, this doesn't

40
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,180
look so right, I think.

41
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,040
Oh yeah, I'm a full-grown Now big love!

42
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,020
Thank you!

43
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,020
Thank you, thank you!

44
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,480
A whole year.

45
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,440
Soon we'll be having people to two years.

46
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,220
And they will be rainbow.

47
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,880
It's so exciting.

48
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:03,900
Agree!

49
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,680
Agree!

50
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,140
Agree!

51
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,440
Thank you, pregnant!

52
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,560
Talk to her lawyer.

53
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,860
Talk to my lawyer.

54
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
How many...

55
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,140
I wonder how many of terms of services are being written by
like chat GPT nowadays though.

56
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,240
But they have to be checked over by like a lawyer usually,
no?

57
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Would have chat GPT put something in funny in there.

58
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:44,140
If you agree, you always have to do a silly dance on the
first Monday of every month at 2 p.m.

59
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,040
Oh, Tuesday, Victor, welcome back!

60
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:52,860
Hi, Victor.

61
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,300
I'm so glad I finally get to watch live again.

62
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,320
My new work schedule makes it impossible, usually.

63
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,380
Charitable!

64
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,680
Oh, my gosh!

65
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,400
Welcome back.

66
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,660
Thank you.

67
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,880
Oh, hi, Vince.

68
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,840
Oh, Steiner?

69
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,440
Just checking.

70
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,900
You did read the terms of agreement on our contract, right?

71
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,440
I read our contract.

72
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,600
Why are you super chatting me?

73
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,460
Stop that.

74
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,460
Stop that.

75
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,340
What the heck?

76
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,020
What are you doing?

77
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,800
Get out of here.

78
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,040
Did Steiner read it though?

79
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,660
Actually, I snuck that clause in.

80
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,460
I snuck that clause in before signing it.

81
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,980
I wrote, Steiner must dance on the first Monday of...

82
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,540
Steiner Monday must dance on the first Monday of the month
at 2 p.m.

83
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,460
Which 2 p.m.

84
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,120
is it?

85
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,580
All of them.

86
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,280
Hourly, you must dance at 2 p.m.

87
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,300
It's 2 p.m.

88
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:57,860
somewhere.

89
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:58,740
Dance.

90
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,460
Dance, manager, dance.

91
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,560
All of them.

92
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,280
All of them.

93
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,100
All of them.

94
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,660
You guys, when I first came up with my schedule, I didn't
realize that there was going to be a million things.

95
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:25,720
happening this saturday so today there's a lot of things
that i want to watch so i fear that today might be a shorter

96
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:35,680
stream but that's okay lots of things going on is exciting
though when april fools a company added to the customer

97
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,700
agreed to give their soul to them i think 70 something did
their company graciously relinquished their claim later oh

I know!

101
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,560
I will be playing out in Wake.

102
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,900
Yeah, Doki's stream...

103
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,120
She's in an hour, right?

104
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,180
Hold on, I'm double checking.

105
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,060
Oh, I guess more like 45 minutes now.

106
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,040
I would like to raid her.

107
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,000
Because she's doing like a celebration for her second
anniversary?

108
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,740
Yeah, in 45 minutes.

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,420
None of us read the terms and conditions, but we should.

110
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,580
Some companies have hidden cash prizes in their terms and
condition.

111
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,660
Cash, money, prize!

112
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,100
Yeah, I agree to allow Mint Phantom to possess me.

113
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:29,980
Thank you.

114
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,100
Actually, by subscribing, you already allow that.

115
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,100
No, I'm just kidding.

116
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,960
By viewing my profile, you allow me to possess your body.

117
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,040
You allow me to possess your body.

118
00:09:51,060 --> 00:10:01,880
mean how cash money of them so let's get into it oh you can
play the game after agreeing to all the terms of service oh

119
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:11,720
there's only 12 of them this is so easy user attitudes oh
there's also a timer users must devote themselves

120
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,720
wholeheartedly to the game and actively and passionately
enjoy it if a user forgets the original purpose of enjoying

121
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:27,000
the game they will automatically lose the game i'm having
fun i'm having fun if a user loses sight of how to enjoy the

122
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,140
game you guys just lost the game

123
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,090
in the pursuit of competition or results this will be
considered a deviation from the purpose of the game we

124
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,330
strongly recommend that users who find themselves

125
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:54,030
users who find themselves in such a situation take a break
from the game even if only of mine.

126
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:54,770
Like, I agree.

127
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,790
Oh, I got an achievement for that, for agreeing.

128
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,710
Oh, for mint!

129
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,410
Damn it!

130
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,840
Why are they shaking?

131
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,800
Are they scared?

132
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,220
Wait.

133
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,200
Warm comments from users such as, it was fun or it was
interesting, will bring warmth, like spring sunshine to the

134
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,940
hearts of developers who are facing unknown bugs and never
approaching deadlines and will help increase their

135
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,780
motivation to continue development.

136
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,660
Understand that developers are human too And will overlook
minor glitches and typos We'll sincerely admire the efforts

137
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:54,840
Aww, we love the devs Oh Oh, it disappeared Oh, oh, I got it
I mean, today is also the anniversary of the jazz karaoke

138
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,980
There was a before and after that stream Is it really?

139
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,700
Oh my gosh, I should do like another jazz karaoke karaoke
stream now, shouldn't I?

140
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,620
Of like, in a week or something.

141
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,300
Oh my gosh, Cat Captain!

142
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,020

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Yeah.

146
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,640
Oh, recognize how difficult it is to completely eliminate
bugs during the game.

147
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,880
Discover that bug in the game shall consider it to be a
hidden feature.

148
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,640
Ooh, oh.

149
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,680
Agree?

150
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,480
Okay.

151
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,360
What if you're colorblind?

152
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:47,980
line what is your colorblind though what is this well
sharing oh i don't need to read these do i shoot oh oh oh oh

154
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:03,920
Easy.

155
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,740
The Plinkado Board.

156
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,460
Addiction.

157
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,260
What does that say?

158
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,420
Oh, wait.

159
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,820
Both of you say disagree.

160
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,400
Wait a second.

161
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:17,960
Wait a second.

162
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,740
But they both say disagree.

163
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,380
Is there a degree somewhere?

164
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,300
Devote to loving the game.

165
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,360
What about the...

166
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:28,640
Agree.

167
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,000
Agree.

168
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,260
Somewhere.

169
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,320
Is it in here?

170
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,200
I strongly recommend finding out of the way to regain the
peace of mind.

171
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,620
Just to read the TOS carefully.

172
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,480
I am checky!

173
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,160
I am!

174
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,120
Oh!

175
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,420
Oh my god.

176
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,820
I thought it was going to be like behind it or something.

177
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,600
Agreed!

178
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,680
If you were colorblind it wouldn't... Oh yeah, you still
just click...

179
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
You still just click...

180
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,780
Agreed now, don't you?

181
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,500
Handling of personal information.

182
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,380
Oh, what is this?

183
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:27,860
Oh.

184
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:29,880
Oh.

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,520
Oh.

186
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:32,820
Whoop.

187
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,860
Oh, gosh, oh, gosh, oh, gosh, oh, gosh.

188
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,320
Whoop.

189
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,620
Okay.

190
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:39,860
Whoop.

191
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,160
Oh, my gosh.

192
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,780
It's like, it's like, uh, whoop.

193
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,940
It's like, uh, when they...

194
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,640
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

195
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,320
Oh my god.

196
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,840
Agreed.

197
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,720
When you have to take off a...

198
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,160
A...

199
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,580
A nugget.

200
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,120
A tablecloth.

201
00:14:59,600 --> 00:14:59,920
You know?

202
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,720
And you have to...

203
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,320
Like really fast.

204
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,980
And without letting all the...

205
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,160
Have you guys ever done that before?

206
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,120
I've never...

207
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,180
I want to try it in like a rage room.

208
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,260
I want to set up like a table with a bunch of glass.

209
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,040
Like a bunch of china and stuff.

210
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,840
Find china.

211
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,700
And set it all up.

212
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,960
really nicely on the table and then

213
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,440
who is SS FV?

214
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,420
Oh my god, cat captain!

215
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,760
Thank you so much for the ping!

216
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,420
Thank you!

217
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,480
Thank you!

218
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,660
Sorry, I missed it, I think.

219
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,540
I tried it.

220
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,720
It didn't go well.

221
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,380
I think I could do it.

222
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,780
But that's why I would have to be in a rage room.

223
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,780
Have you guys ever done a rage room before?

224
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,200
Will I need one after this?

225
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,740
Do it with plastic to practice?

226
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:55,020
But the plastic wouldn't be like the heaviness that it needs
to be, right?

227
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,260
I would love to try.

228
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,760
I've heard places that you get to put on your own song.

229
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,120
You know?

230
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,620
You get to put on like your own like raging song.

231
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,320
And I think break stuff is too...

232
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,560
Is too like obvious.

233
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,300
You know what I mean?

234
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,300
I feel like the winner takes it all.

235
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:32,220
like the winner takes it all and you're like and like really
cathartic or the um the frank sinatra song oh what is a man

236
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:42,040
you know like i can imagine just like really releasing all
the emotions in that but i think break stuff also works very

237
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,980
well too really depends on what kind of emotion you're going
for sometimes they don't like you throw things what what's

238
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,580
the point

239
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,300
I see the vision.

240
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,160
Totally good for slow-mo, though.

241
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,040
You could slow-mo.

242
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,560
Yeah, Bohemian Rhapsody.

243
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,680
Yeah, yeah, that's another good one.

244
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,460
That's another good one.

245
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,000
Taking a sledgehammer to some tables while MyWay is playing.

246
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,960
That's what I'm saying!

247
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,300
You see the vision, right?

248
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,440
You're feeling it?

249
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,600
Snake Eater!

250
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,480
Snake Eater would also be a really...

251
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,600
A rage room!

252
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,880
With Snake Eater playing!

253
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:37,140
I give my life Not for honor But for you Crash, crash, crash
Rolls of nature Oh, it's you can I feel like with a rage

254
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:44,620
room you either go for like the For obviously like the Pure
rage like with a metal song or something Or you go for like

255
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:52,540
the cathartic like Like Emotional like Ah I need to get out
my feelings.

256
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,940
Dramatic or angry.

257
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,880
That's a good way.

258
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,880
Don't Stop Me Now works really well, too.

259
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,640
I could say it.

260
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,640
Don't Stop Me Now.

261
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,980
Now I want to sing.

262
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,500
Oh, my bad.

263
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,060
Handling of game data.

264
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,060
What is this?

265
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,740
Ha!

266
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,220

Ha!

270
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,880
What is it?

271
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,920
What is happening?

272
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,500
Oh.

273
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,280

hit the obstacles instead of reverse trying to avoid them.

277
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,810
Farts out when you miss one.

278
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,990
Regarding fraud.

279
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,390
Cheating in this game is prohibited.

280
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,750
If you cheat, agree.

281
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:26,690
No!

282
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,170
He is tough from the beginning!

283
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,570
Oh no!

284
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,310

Easy.

304
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,210
Catch.

305
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:10,850

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,490
The one that I need to get.

307
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,870
Oh, it's not a release.

308
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,070

Release!

315
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,550
Addiction.

316
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,650
I have

317
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,460
to be careful not to press.

318
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,150
I have to be careful not to press disagree on action.

319
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,950
Where's your motivation?

320
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
We're good?

321
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,620
That was easy?

322
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,860
No worries.

323
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,040
No problem.

324
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,160
Chance to win a luxurious prizes.

325
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,560
You get the prize, your dart hits.

326
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:31,820
Oh, wait.

327
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,660
This is like...

328
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,680
This feels like...

329
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,440
Oh my gosh.

330
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,540
This feels like luck almost.

331
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,680
Oh my god.

332
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,240
It goes so fast.

333
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:41,680
Ha!

334
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,540
Okay.

335
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,100
I got a scrubbing brush!

336
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,880
That's not what I- oh, only two chances.

337
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,960
It's the run killer.

338
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,140
There's no way left to agree.

339
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,080
And?

340
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,250
What about it?

341
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,320
This is fine.

342
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,560
I am not a robot.

343
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,760
What is the most important thing to you?

344
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,120
If I were Mr. Crabs, I'd say money.

345
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
But I'll say love.

346
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,780
I would say love.

347
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,960
Oh, oh, it's this one again, right?

348
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,520
Oh, no, it's different this time.

349
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,720
Oh my god.

350
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,300
There she is.

351
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,600
Agree.

352
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,410
How's the music and stuff, by the way?

353
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,110
What is this now?

354
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,510
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

355
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,830
Oh, uh, open.

356
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,130
Oh, shoot.

357
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:12,810
Wait, I need you.

358
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:13,830
Oh.

359
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:15,890
Uh.

360
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,330
Oh, no.

361
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,330
I need a G.

362
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:22,830
I need a G.

363
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,050
Oh, no.

364
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,030
You have to spell it.

365
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,170
Arig!

366
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,030
Okay.

367
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,970
Wait, that makes it a little more difficult now, doesn't it?

368
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,370
Alright, hold on.

369
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,730
Uh, A.

370
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:48,730
G.

371
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,330
Oh, no, I could have used that R.

372
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:51,530
Oh, shoot.

373
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,050
Okay.

374
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,690
We still have time.

375
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,510
A gate?

376
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,730
What'd you call me?

377
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:06,910
A gate?

378
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,050
Oh, shoot.

379
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,430
I forgot that there's a timer.

380
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,550
A, G, R, R.

381
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,930
Oh no, I couldn't use that E.

382
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,810
Ah, yes, good, good, good.

383
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,470
E.

384
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,670
Yeah!

385
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,030
Why are you again?

386
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,550
Oh, it's this one again.

387
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:54,390
Hoi!

388
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,530
Agree.

389
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:57,830
Thank-y-o!

390
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,670
Oh, yes!

391
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,010
Yes!

392
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,450
No!

393
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:03,810
Yes!

394
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,070
Yes!

395
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:06,370
No!

396
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,450
Yes!

397
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:07,850
Yes!

398
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,710
Agree.

399
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:19,290
I can't just ask that in 2026.

400
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,730
Is this the one?

401
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,210
Disagree, disagree.

402
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:33,230
Oh!

403
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:35,210
There.

404
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,070
You give one shot?

405
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
That's so mean!

406
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,210
Scummy rage rooms charge per item slash hit.

407
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,450
Wait, no they don't.

408
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:01,670
What?

409
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,990
Better to pay a junkyard owner or buy stuff from Goodwill,
Amazon, and Kira.

410
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,170
Wait, they pay?

411
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,610
Or step on home?

412
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,390
No.

413
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,370
Does Minto make you go doki-doki?

414
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,650
Agree or agree?

415
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,630
Guys, a streamer even trying.

416
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,110
Oh, it's this one again.

417
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,630
Okay, okay.

418
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,970
Oh, here we go.

419
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,130
Oh.

420
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,250
Hint?

421
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:31,990
No.

422
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,830
No.

423
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,270
What do you mean, hint?

424
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
I don't trust the game.

425
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,780
For the hint.

426
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:46,760
You know?

427
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,910
I don't really trust it.

428
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,860
Disagree.

429
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,920
How big is this map?

430
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,820
No, no cheaters.

431
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,900
Oh, I almost clicked it.

432
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,420
Disagree.

433
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,600
Oh.

434
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,590
What?

435
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,770
Does one say agree?

436
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,450
But it's red?

437
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,970
Click hint.

438
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,360
Is below here.

439
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,120
Oh, okay.

440
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,060
That's like so...

441
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,420
Hint!

442
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,640
Left of here.

443
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,920
You saw it!

444
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,360
Did you?

445
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,220
Up?

446
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,380
Oh!

447
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,580
Oh gosh, I'm ready.

448
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,010
Where are you?

449
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,980
Where are you?

450
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,700
Oh, never mind.

451
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:09,960
Never mind.

452
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,440
I thought it was the one that was going to fly at me.

453
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,800
Oh, wait.

454
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,700
Was there one in there?

455
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,350
Oh, ah, I see it.

456
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:27,770
I see it.

457
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:28,650
Agree.

458
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,430
I saw it.

459
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,170
I saw it.

460
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:39,710
Oh, okay.

461
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,730
That one wasn't so bad.

462
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,170
That one wasn't so bad.

463
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,030
I haven't made it past...

464
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,310
Wait, no.

465
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,530
I think I've made it to six.

466
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,460
Oh,

467
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,440
shoot.

468
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,420
Oh, okay.

469
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,000
Oh, yeah.

470
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,340
Oh, sure.

471
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,180
Nice!

472
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,040
Kobe.

473
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,740
Ow!

474
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,160
Sorry, Kobe.

475
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,680
Kobe.

476
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,260
Yes, yes!

477
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,840
Kobe.

478
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,000
Oh, yeah!

479
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,380
That was so clean.

480
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,860
That was so clean.

481
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,790
Oh,

482
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,600
I almost pressed the disagree.

483
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,230
Maybe I got to 7 instead.

484
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,830
Because I didn't get another achievement.

485
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,710
Oh, no.

486
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,250
I was right above it!

487
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:11,990
No!

488
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,330
Is this the one where it jumps up?

489
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,990
I'm clicking around.

490
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,830
Uh, which one was this again?

491
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,400
You need faster reflexes.

492
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

493
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,180
Why don't you stream then if you have faster reflexes than
me, huh?

494
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,320
Yeah?

495
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,020
I'm afraid...

496
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,180
Oh!

497
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,460
Ah-ha!

498
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,100
What's this one?

499
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,340
Oh!

500
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh, I see it.

501
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,160
Oh, oops.

502
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,160
Is it the same one?

503
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,000
It's not the same one.

504
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,300
Oh, oh, here it is.

505
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:37,900
Agree.

506
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,220
Alright, I'm starting to learn.

507
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,670
Did you see that first though?

508
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,390
I clicked it and it didn't register.

509
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,890
want you all to see.

510
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,230
You all saw that, right?

511
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:53,810
I clicked it.

512
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,290
It showed the clicking animation and it did not register.

513
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,570
It did not register.

514
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,730
You saw that.

515
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,370
The game is sabotaging me.

516
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:02,510
It's cheating.

517
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,830
It's cheating.

518
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,070
Click stronger.

519
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,830
I'll testify in court.

520
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,790
Clicked it.

521
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,850
Oh, I clicked it.

522
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,530
What is this one now?

523
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:22,070
Confirm?

524
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,040
If your mouse is hard to see.

525
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,080
No, it's me.

526
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,800
I'm not going to change it.

527
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,880
That was mean.

528
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,080
Oh, is this the one where it jumps up in the air?

529
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:56,700
No!

530
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,840
It's flare.

531
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,060
It's like an anomaly game.

532
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,380
It's like an anomaly game.

533
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,100
Oh, there you are.

534
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,600
Where's Wilde?

535
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,820
There's so many.

536
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,040
Confirmed.

537
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,420
Agreed to all check boxes.

538
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,420
There's more?

539
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:31,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh my gosh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

540
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,540
no, no, no, no, no,

541
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,890
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

542
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,730
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

543
00:35:41,730 --> 00:36:02,490
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no Wait, no, no, no, no, God, no, please, it's gonna

544
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:02,910
zoom.

545
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,950
That's the run killer!

546
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,130
You were saying.

547
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,230
Agreed?

548
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,930
Oh, it's this one again, okay.

549
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,510
Why does it feel like there's way more this time than
before, huh?

550
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:46,250
I'm reading them just in case they don't just in case this
one of them says disagree you know

551
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:10,120
I know you're fast enough to catch a veto it's that darn
slide whistle it is never get tired of the sound effect of

552
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,380
the green button fly.

553
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,560
It's like it's mocking me.

554
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,300
Okay.

555
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:18,980
It's fine.

556
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,200
We were still in early game.

557
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,840
I would have never gotten it, you guys.

558
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,980
Great reading, Bito.

559
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,220
I would have never gotten that.

560
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,180
I would have never gotten that.

561
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,720
That one would definitely kill me.

562
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

563
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,600
You know what?

564
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,200
Maybe hints are not cheats.

565
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,400
Disagree.

566
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:54,980
Mm-mm.

567
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,180
It's only a 3x3.

568
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,360
You don't understand.

569
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,420
Have you reviewed?

570
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,340
Yes.

571
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,180
Did you really?

572
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,600
Yes.

573
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,980
They're really long.

574
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,240
Did you really read them in?

575
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,620
Yes.

576
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,320
Seems to me no truth.

577
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,280
Don't lie.

578
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,760
I...

579
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,060
It's not even that long!

580
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,380
Yes.

581
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,200
Yes.

582
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,260
Were there any parts of the terms you could not agree with?

583
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,440
No.

584
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,320
You understand that you fully agree.

585
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:32,900
Yes.

586
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,500
Really?

587
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,080
Yes.

588
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:34,760
Seriously?

589
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,180
Did you really?

590
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,580
Yes.

591
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,160
So this counts as your agreement?

592
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,520
Agree!

593
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,880
More like Higged, fried tom.

594
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,480
Psychin' me out!

595
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,780
Psychin' me out.

596
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,700
Oh.

599
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:19,020
before the game started yeah yeah yeah we just got a few
things left to agree to and we'll be Pimmed ass

600
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:42,220
Addition Subtraction 24 Minus 41 No

601
00:39:51,370 --> 00:40:10,550
Just left to right I thought it was addition and subtraction
You know what It's fine.

602
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,110
I didn't go to...

603
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,910
I didn't go to...

604
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,310
to basic math class.

605
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,070
That might be news to some people.

606
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,890
I didn't go to... I don't know math.

607
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,470
I didn't go to basic math class.

608
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,370
24 minus 3.

609
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,530
21.

610
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,070
Uh... 30.

611
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:35,870
Uh...

612
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,550
59?

613
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:42,930
...

614
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,280
...

615
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,170
You're thinking of multiplication for order of operations.

616
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:01,630
When do you use the PEMDAS when you do it, though?

617
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,250
I thought it was always.

618
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,070
You ever look at a word so long it stops looking like
something a human would say?

619
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,270
What is an agree?

620
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,250
Why did we make this a word?

621
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,290
It just sounds right, no?

622
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,310
Agree.

623
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:17,610
Agree.

624
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,670
It's when there's brackets.

625
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,510
Oh!

626
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,330
Oh, okay, okay.

627
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,030
Oh, okay, okay.

628
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,670
Thank you, everybody.

629
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,550
Antoa, thank you so much for the 10kettos.

630
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,460
Always, but wait.

631
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,140
Plus and minus are treated in the same order.

632
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,560
Meep, thank you so much for the 10kettos.

633
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,600
Thank you.

634
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,860
Wait.

635
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:06,860
So, so if it's just like that, then if there's
multiplication and division, would put those before but if

636
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:19,120
there's but if there's just addition subtraction it's
counted the same this is math class now envision the agree

637
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,920
button is a special edition r18 dogen of oselot and snake
there's a limited supply of them and you can only get one

638
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:32,380
chance to buy and now go click that agree button next time
we try them we thank you for this every time yes okay do you

639
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,080
agree that Yeah, there's even song about it, I heard.

640
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,980
P-E, parentheses, M-D, parentheses, A-S.

641
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,380
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

642
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,360
Duck boy, welcome to Mamboship, thank you!

643
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,400
Subtraction is just adding a negative number.

644
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,420
They're the same thing.

645
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,500
Sure.

646
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,360
Do anything in parentheses first.

647
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,380
Oh, then handle exponents.

648
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,800
that as a little like two a tiny two right

649
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:29,220
Andrew welcome to Mambusha thank you yes okay the parrot
number on your shoulder oh what am i a pirate oh

669
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:42,440
oh no i think this is the run killer no way there's no way

00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,610
Careful, careful, careful.

00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:00,070
I am closing with intent.

they're not solid until you let go.

742
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,590
I know, but it's difficult.

743
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,860
It's just difficult enough getting them to the green.

744
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,040
And then you have the bombs.

745
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,860
Sorry.

746
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,820
I wasn't paying attention.

747
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,580
I saw green.

748
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,780
Much like you guys, you see green women and you're like,

00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,900
Oh.

753
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,400

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,280
Agreed.

755
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,520

757
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,280
That one is the worst one?

758
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,680
You think so?

759
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,740
I am closing with intent!

760
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,780
I will make Sure, I do not press disagree.

761
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:23,380
Yeah, I am closing and making sure there is no red behind
the next door.

762
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:31,340
Ha, he, he, he, he, he, he, oh my gosh, they even put it on
the other side.

763
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,660
You don't gotta call me out like that green woman.

764
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:33,800
What?

765
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:38,640
What?

766
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:43,760
Where is your motivation?

Have you guys?

772
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,620
Every single time I've gotten a disagree on the first one
and an agree on the second one.

00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,360
It's kind of crazy.

774
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,200
That was close though.

775
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,320
That was close.

776
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:10,940

Oh my god.

901
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,260
I thought it was gonna be like a joke of a thing, you know
what I mean?

902
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:43,680
Like a joke.

903
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,100
That's why I tried all the items first.

904
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,100
Stamina.

905
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,600
My attack went up!

906
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,840
I should have done that first.

907
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:52,540
Holy cow.

908
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,860
Oh, no, my defense, though.

909
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
I think I need to do...

910
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,560
I need to heal.

911
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,220
He's gonna kill me.

912
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:04,520
Okay.

913
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,180
But my attack went up.

914
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:08,640
Oh!

915
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:09,980
Oh my god!

916
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,260
He's not... Oh gosh!

01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,100
Oh no!

918
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:12,540
Ah!

919
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,160
It's so over.

920
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,160
It's so over.

921
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,140
It's so over!

922
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,220
My defense!

923
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:42,620
11 damage We did it Holy cow Oh my god I think it would have
been over for us in the next turn Oh my god I think it would

924
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:47,080
have been over for us in the next one Holy cow Oh

925
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,460
We were so I

926
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:13,260
went through that whole arc just to miss the very slow
falling.

927
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,460
Oh my god!

928
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:25,370
Sorry guys, I fumbled that one.

929
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:29,930
I fumbled that one for real.

930
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,250
Oh my god!

931
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,420
Really keeps it on your toes, huh?

932
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,160
Oh my god, I'm sick of this one, I think.

933
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,540
Why'd you just stare at it?

934
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,220
I wasn't staring, I was clicking.

935
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,000
I was!

936
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,700
It just didn't look like I was, but I was.

937
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,100
It didn't look like it.

938
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,280
But I was.

939
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:10,940
I didn't...

940
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,420
I was like, no way there would be a second.

941
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,920
I think those reflexes are dead.

942
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,740
I mean, I am dead, so...

943
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:20,840
Oh.

944
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,340
Nope.

945
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:23,640
Nope.

946
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,140
Yes.

947
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:45,610
Oh.

948
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:46,470
Wait.

949
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:47,450
I don't

950
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,260
know how from here.

951
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,100
I don't know how.

952
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,360
I

953
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:13,550
don't like these.

954
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,030
I'm so bad at them.

955
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,030
I've never learned the trick on how to do them.

956
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,580
I'm just random clicking for real though.

957
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,720
Oh, okay, it's this one.

958
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,320
Oh, it's one of these types of puzzles.

959
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,220
Kind of.

960
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,240
Oh, shoot.

961
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:23,900
Oh.

962
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,380
Wait, why does that one uncheck?

963
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,860
What the hell?

964
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,060
You are not...

965
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,940
Wait, why are some of these unchecking?

966
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:39,730
What?

967
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:40,690
Why did you uncheck?

968
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,290
Why?

969
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,780
I think I had it.

970
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:52,600
No!

971
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:57,700
Uh...

972
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,340
Is this the one that zooms by?

973
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:00,920
Wait, what is this?

974
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,840
What is going on in this?

975
01:06:12,270 --> 01:06:12,870
Meow.

976
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:17,030
Whala de bemco.

977
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:28,210
Keep scrolling.

978
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:28,750
I did.

979
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:29,910
Alright, let's...

980
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:36,450
80?

981
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,250
Get the 80?

982
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:38,050
Get the 80?

983
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:38,510
No!

984
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:38,970
No!

985
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:40,090
Get the 80?

986
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:41,070
No!

987
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,620
We're not having such good luck here, guys.

988
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,420
Okay, we're at zero.

989
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:50,940
80!

990
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,200
30?

991
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:52,880
50?

992
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:53,580
Yes!

993
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,120
Okay.

994
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:59,460
60!

995
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:00,380
Oh!

996
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,080
60!

997
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:01,420
None!

998
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:03,260
Oh!

999
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,980
Wait, did that divide by two?

1000
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,380
Oh, maybe it divided by zero?

1001
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,140
Oh, no, you can't divide by zero.

1002
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:15,280
There's going to be some sort of weird paradox thing.

1003
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:15,820
I don't know.

1004
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,420
Oh, my gosh, we're so close.

1005
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:18,980
Please.

1006
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:21,960
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1007
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:22,720
No!

1008
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:37,940
Okay.

1009
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,700
Oh, I think we made it!

1010
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:43,960
Ah!

1011
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,880
We made it!

1012
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,660
We made it, we made it, we made it.

1013
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:52,600
Ah!

1014
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,900
Which one is this one?

1015
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:58,900
No!

1016
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:29,300
It's

1017
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:39,900
time!

1018
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,080
Okay, I got it, I got it.

1019
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,260
It's like right here, isn't it?

1020
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:43,740
It's like right down here?

1021
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:52,670
It is this one, right?

1022
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:52,790
Oh.

1023
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:55,070
Oh, oh.

1024
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:56,330
Wait a second.

1025
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:00,490
It's not.

1026
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:01,790
Oh!

1027
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:02,170
Oh!

1028
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:03,290
Oh, I see it.

1029
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,070
Dang.

1030
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,530
I was so certain.

1031
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:09,270
I was so ready.

1032
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:14,770
Love.

1033
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:21,030
Banana peel slipping ass sound effect.

1034
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:21,650
I know!

1035
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:22,590
I know!

1036
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:26,270
What is the name of the person you like?

1037
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:29,770
Can't tell you guys that!

1038
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:33,310
Hi, boo.

1039
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:48,840
Wait, do I push it into a corner or...

1040
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,460
There we go.

1041
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,500
It runs away from me because it likes me and it's nervous.

1042
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,560
Wait, what is this?

1043
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,640
No way.

1044
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,640
Is this...

1045
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,220
It's like a game!

1046
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,840
I never played that.

1047
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,620
Wait, I read a bit.

1048
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,260
carefully.

1049
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,000
I read it carefully.

1050
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:21,360
Uh.

1051
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,800
I read it carefully.

1052
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,140
I read it carefully.

1053
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,160
Oh my god.

1054
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,180
Sleek again.

1055
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,380
I never played this though.

1056
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,200
At least it gives you a lot of time, it seems.

1057
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:37,960
I read it carefully.

1058
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:38,880
Hooy!

1059
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,000
Oh!

1060
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:40,380
Oh!

1061
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,340
Nice, nice, nice.

1062
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,080
Okay, where are we at?

1063
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,160
Completely understood.

1064
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,500
Unconfirmed.

1065
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,960
Where's I read a bit?

1066
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,160
I read it carefully like here-ish.

1067
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,120
Oh no, I can't get to the unconfirmed.

1068
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,800
Oh no, I messed up.

1069
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,880
Oh no, I can't get to the I read a bit either.

1070
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,460
Oh no, I think I messed up.

1071
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,900
Oh no, oh, oh, nice, nice, nice.

1072
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,700
I read it carefully.

1073
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:09,920
I read a bit.

1074
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:11,840
I read a bit.

1075
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,080
I read a bit.

1076
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:18,900
Oh, shoot.

1077
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:19,880
I meant it.

1078
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,240
Okay.

1079
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,300
Maybe I could push it.

1080
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:23,900
Yeah.

1081
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,700
They're all so similar.

1082
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,740
It's really hard to...

1083
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,240
Come on, come on.

1084
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,700
No, please.

1085
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:36,720
Okay, unconfirmed.

1086
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:37,120
Over here.

1087
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:37,880
Push them.

1088
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:38,380
Yes!

1089
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,520
I kind of agree.

1090
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,640
We're close.

1091
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,430
I think...

1092
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:52,130
I need to do, I read a bit over here.

1093
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:56,570
Yes, so...

1094
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:56,890
Okay.

1095
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:58,590
Kind of agree.

1096
01:11:58,770 --> 01:11:59,530
We're so close.

1097
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:06,510
I wish I could just drop it my own.

1098
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:07,050
You know what I mean?

1099
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:08,750
Like, rather than it.

1100
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:10,770
Okay, read it carefully.

1101
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:14,030
No.

1102
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:15,890
It's so far.

1103
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:17,230
Read it carefully.

1104
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:18,730
Read it carefully.

1105
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:20,750
Read it carefully.

1106
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:28,090
Oh, I should have dropped it.

1107
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,230

Oh my god.

01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:33,550
There we go.

1204
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:36,590
And on a win!

1205
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:38,110
What is this one?

1206
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:39,890

1207
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:41,970

1212
01:21:59,440 --> 01:21:59,900
Yes, pillow.

1213
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:00,440
Yes, pillow.

1214
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:01,020
Yes, pillow.

1215
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:01,600
Yes, pillow.

1216
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,180
Yes, pillow.

1217
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:03,760
Yes, pillow.

1218
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,360
Yes, pillow.

1219

Woo!

1222
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,220
Is that a yes, no pillow?

1223
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,540
It absolutely is.

1224
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,860
Select all the body parts you like!

1225
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,340
You are not confirmed you are confirmed not to be a robot.

1226
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:08,580
Very human-like.

1227
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:09,660
Be honest, Minto.

1228
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:12,720
I am.

1229
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:15,360
I am honest.

1230
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:23,290
I am honest.

1231
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:23,950
Oh, no.

1232
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:25,350
Where are you coming?

1233
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,210
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1234
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:28,830
Oh, oh, oh.

1235
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:29,770
What is that?

1236
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:37,850
I wish, um...

1237
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:42,690
I wish on the menu that there was...

1238
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:45,110
That there was a...

1239
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:48,030
Like, you can choose which mini-game.

1240
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:52,830
Because I would go until I can get the zooming shot.

1241
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:53,950
Oh.

1242
01:23:59,200 --> 01:23:59,740
Oh no!

1243
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:02,100
Oh okay.

1244
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,460
Oh this is tricky.

1245
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,360
You can pick a game?

1246
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:08,680
Oh!

1247
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:10,160
There's a casual mode.

1248
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:15,440
After maybe once I lose I'll try it and go until I...

1249
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:17,960
We're so close.

1250
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:22,730
Here it is.

1251
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:23,170
The winner.

1252
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:24,290
The winner.

1253
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:25,330
The winner.

1254
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:28,150
The winner.

1255
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:29,790
The winner!

1256
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:32,150
Yippee!

1257
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:36,530
Oh, it's this one again.

1258
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:47,810
I think it's in the same spot that it was before.

1259
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:53,490
No!

1260
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:55,670
Oh, no, no, no.

1261
01:24:56,450 --> 01:24:57,310
No, no, no.

1262
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:00,370
Oh, shoot.

1263
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:13,910
Oh.

1264
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:19,380
Ow!

1265
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,460
That one is hard.

1266
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:25,460
That one is difficult.

1267
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:27,600
All right, casual mode.

1268
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,320
Wait.

1269
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:35,500
Is that...

1270
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:35,740
Wait.

1271
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,080
Retry penalty.

1272
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,140
Wait, return the title.

1273
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:45,640
Ah, I see.

1274
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,280
No, Brandon, you're totally fine.

1275
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:49,660
Thank you for the super chat.

1276
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:50,840
I hope you're feeling good.

1277
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,720
Snow was beautiful.

1278
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,320
Feeling better now, though.

1279
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:54,860
I hope you're well.

1280
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:55,380
You too.

1281
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:55,840
You too.

1282
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,560
Take it easy.

1283
01:25:59,280 --> 01:25:59,600
Wait.

1284
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:00,800
So...

1285
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,180
Ah, cool.

1286
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,380
No, I thought...

1287
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:08,800
What I mentioned is I wish there was an option to pick
whichever...

1288
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,340
Like the mini-game that you want to do, you know what I
mean?

1289
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:15,830
Hmm...

1290
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:16,510

1302
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,940
I wasn't saying that this one was going to be easy.

1303
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,200
Come on.

1304
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,250
It's literally hitting everything by it.

1305
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:14,680
Please.

1306
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,400
Can I hit it now?

1307
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:20,860
Oh, okay.

1308
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,100

01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:24,460
Nice flag you threw up there.

01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,680

01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,040
Streamer lock!

1315
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,340
More blue.

1316
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:50,270
I'd say that's pretty close.

1317
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,640
What?

1318
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,480
How close do they need to be?

1319
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:23,660
No, it's not more red.

1320
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:24,820
Definitely not more red.

1321
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,620
We had it.

1322
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,280
Within five minutes.

Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, this is how these games are in the
ads, too.

1333
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:11,570
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1334
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:15,630
Peel, peel, peel, peel, peel, peel, peel, peel, peel, peel,

01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:19,870
Oh, oh, guys, it's so over.

1336
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:21,370
It's so over for us.

1337
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:25,330
Oh my god.

1338
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:27,370
Oh my god.

1339
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:36,560
Oh, it's differing each time now, too.

1340
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:39,460
Hmm.

1341
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,420
The flood gate has opened.

1342
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:48,000
At least it doesn't multiply or anything.

1343
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:49,340
Wait, how?

1344
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,620
How do they want me to do this?

1345
01:31:52,620 --> 01:32:05,460
I was trying to open up that one but oh my god please this
is unfair how am I supposed to get the one if all of my

1346
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:19,280
things are avoiding it this is a tougher one it seems pretty
tough yeah because we're so slow our little attack oh my

1347
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:25,880
gosh oh there's the floodgates we're so we're so it's over
first Oh my gosh, on the other side too.

1348
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:26,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1349
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,620
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

Ouch, ouch.

01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:34,680
Ouch, ouch.

1352
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,120
Oh, it's over.

1353
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:37,120
This one's hard.

1354
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:38,180
I don't like this one.

1355
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,300
Shuffle retry.

1356
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,280
Shuffle retry.

1357
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,160
Oh, I see it.

1358
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:50,460
Oh my god.

1359
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,680
We can do this one.

1360
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:53,920
We can do this one.

1361
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:01,270
Re-try, retry, retry.

1362
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:02,110
We can do this one.

1363
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:04,030
Ouch.

1364
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:05,430
We can do this one.

1365
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:06,030
We try it.

1366
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:06,210
We try.

1367
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:07,250
We can do this one.

1368
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:08,810
We can do this.

1369
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:09,290
We can do this.

1370
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:09,970
We can do this.

1371
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:11,250
We can do this.

1372
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,650
We can do this.

1373
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:16,390
We can do this.

1374
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:16,710
Shot.

1375
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:20,530
What am I doing?

1376
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,620
Oh, she's stuck.

1377
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:54,510
No.

1378
01:33:55,570 --> 01:33:56,330
I like trying.

1379
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:56,510
No.

1380
01:33:56,510 --> 01:33:59,430
I like trying all the ways, though, to like, all the
different games are pretty fun.

1381
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:01,890
shuffle retry.

1382
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:03,750
Agreed.

1383
01:34:04,690 --> 01:34:06,570
The agreement program is infected with a virus.

1384
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:09,010
It's kind of dangerous, so please fix the program.

1385
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:12,510
Be careful that the agree button does not come into contact
with the surrounding agreement virus.

1386
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,780
Am I supposed to explode these?

1387
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:24,860
Oh!

1388
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:27,060
Wait, what?

1389
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,320
Actually, I'm confused.

1390
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:29,680
Hold on.

1391
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,040
Am I supposed to explode these or...

1392
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:33,840
Oh,

1393
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:40,800
like that!

1394
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:41,840
Okay, okay.

1395
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:42,920
Okay.

1396
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:51,170
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

1397
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:53,010
I was trapped!

1398
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:56,530
There is nothing I could have done!

1399
01:34:58,690 --> 01:34:59,970
There's nothing I could have done!

1400
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,490
This one seems doable.

1401
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:06,090
I just have to be really fast in the beginning.

1402
01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:08,990
Before they start coming in.

1403
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:10,090
Oh, oh.

1404
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:27,750
Oh, shoot.

1405
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,290
Oh, shoot.

1406
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:28,970
Oh, shoot.

1407
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:29,230
Oh, shoot.

1408
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:29,290
Oh, shoot.

1409
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:31,570
Okay, maybe it's okay.

1410
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:43,150
We're about to do it.

1411
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:49,090
The final boss.

1412
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:54,190
No way the final boss is this!

1413
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:58,050
My attack.

1414
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:05,110
My's turn.

1415
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:06,950
12 damage.

1416
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:13,890
Can I do... What was the... What made my defense go up?

1417
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:18,750
My naughty book made me hard.

1418
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:21,570
Yes, my body.

1419
01:36:21,870 --> 01:36:22,550
It's like hardened.

1420
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:23,370
You know?

1421
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:24,030
And Pokemon.

1422
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,740
I'm gonna throw my sword.

1423
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,460
Ultimate sword!

1424
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:48,620
Yeah!

1425
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,620
Oh gosh!

1426
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:53,680
Okay, hold on.

1427
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,760
16 HP!

1428
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,060
I'm gonna do...

1429
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:16,640
Medicine!

1430
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:20,720
Oh, that's my MP.

1431
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:21,280
I forgot.

1432
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:21,960
Oh, shoot.

1433
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,040
Oh, he's sleeping!

1434
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,320
Final Fantagree.

1435
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:29,940
I'm gonna...

1436
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,840
I'm gonna magic.

1437
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,440
I'm gonna heal.

1438
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:39,500
Okay, five damage.

1439
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,560
Okay, it's not bad.

1440
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:44,600
And...

1441
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:44,800
Oh!

1442
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:53,700
Space.

1443
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:54,360
Oh.

1444
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:00,450
Oh my god.

1445
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:02,710
This is also a rage game.

1446
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:03,590
Oh my god, no.

1447
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:05,610
I think this is also a rage game.

1448
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:07,510
I think this is also a rage game.

1449
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:08,750
No way.

1450
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,160
What's this S for?

1451
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,260
Shortcut to the goal!

1452
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:28,960
Oh, shut up.

1453
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:43,910
It

1454
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:57,890
took me 50 minutes.

1455
01:38:58,330 --> 01:38:58,630
No.

1456
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:00,970
It took us 50 minutes.

1457
01:39:05,290 --> 01:39:07,350
The music is so cute.

1458
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:23,860
Hey, actually, is it even possible to make it through the
jump, that part with the...

1459
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,400
I want to actually play it, you know what I mean?

1460
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:28,520
Like, I want to play this one.

1461
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,420
Oh, it is!

1462
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,800
Oh my gosh.

1463
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:37,920
It's like one of those crazy, like, Mario levels that people
make.

1464
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:39,580
No cannibalism either.

1465
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,480
Curse is broken for now.

1466
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:47,810
Just don't jump too high.

1467
01:39:48,330 --> 01:39:49,530
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1468
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:54,480
Yippee!

1469
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:58,490
Yeah, Mario levels.

1470
01:40:01,650 --> 01:40:02,170
Nice.

1471
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:04,430
Maybe one day I'll actually attempt it.

1472
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:05,970
But for now, die.

1473
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:07,290
Hot dog indeed.

1474
01:40:07,450 --> 01:40:08,130
I'm gonna call it here.

1475
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:09,150
Thank you so much, Dry Princess.

1476
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:09,710
Thank you.

1477
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:11,030
Thank you.

1478
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:13,470
I'm gonna call it here.

1479
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:18,730
We shall raid a dokey bird for her second year anniversary.

1480
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:21,370
No cannibalism, but we are hungry.

1481
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:24,330
Sorry it's a bit of a shorter stream today, but I had fun.

1482
01:40:24,450 --> 01:40:26,170
I hope you guys did too.

1483
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:40,780
Mission failed!

1484
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:41,200
Woo!

1485
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:41,900
We beat the game!

1486
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:46,300
Welcome back.

1487
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:47,100
Thank you.

1488
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:48,020
Thank you.

1489
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:50,300
Thank you.

1490
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,260
Death to Clarity.

1491
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,180
Thank you for the peek.

1492
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,060
Thank you so much.

1493
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:54,900
Thank you so much.

1494
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:55,820
Fish and Mail.

1495
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:56,400
Yeah.

1496
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:57,500
Fake me.

1497
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:58,160
Thank you.

1498
01:40:58,380 --> 01:40:59,860
Doki Doki, action ray.

1499
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:02,580
This is so goofy.

1500
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,440
I didn't even rage once.

1501
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:09,180
I still wish I could have gotten the Zoomy one, though.

1502
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,140
I wish I could have gotten it.

1503
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:14,520
One day I will have my revenge.

1504
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:15,940
day.

1505
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,140
I was hoping I would get that one in the replay thing.

1506
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:23,900
I should have just kept doing it until I, like, kept
shuffling until I got it.

1507
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:25,740
That's okay.

1508
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:33,670
I think I... Wait.

1509
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:36,890
Wait, am I on casual?

1510
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:42,390
Oh, hold on.

1511
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:44,230
Wait, oh, wait, hold on.

1512
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:45,590
Let me double check.

1513
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:47,670
Okay, shuffle retry.

1514
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:48,090
Here we go.

1515
01:41:53,270 --> 01:42:08,070
I think I'm addicted Oh it's this one Wait hold on Shuffle,
shuffle Shuffle Shuffle retry No No

1516
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:15,130

Where's the disagree?

1518
01:42:16,490 --> 01:42:22,230
We'll hit it on purpose Disagree I know you're in here Wait,
there is one in here, right?

1519
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:28,130
There it is, okay Wait, I could have just passed it at that
point Oh wait, this one's due?

1520
01:42:29,630 --> 01:42:30,990
What do you want to ask about?

1521
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:35,470
Why does my tummy rumble?

1522
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,360
I'm not really sure.

1523
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,980
Then choose a question from these.

1524
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:52,600
Can you freely draw on the oboe rice with ketchup?

1525
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:54,380
Oh.

1526
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:56,140
Anything else?

01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:56,700
No.

1528
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:57,780

01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:36,690

I read it wrong.

How to erase?

01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:46,130
