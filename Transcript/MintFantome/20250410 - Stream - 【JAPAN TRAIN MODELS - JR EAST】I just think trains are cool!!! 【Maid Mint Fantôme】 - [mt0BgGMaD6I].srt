1
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,980
The train is coming.

2
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,180
The train is coming and so am I.

3
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,870
I have my... I'm using my special camera today.

4
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,710
I'm using my special GoPro.

5
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:46,150
It's getting the up close and fancy sights.

6
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,370
And my reaction to the train.

7
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,270
Starrace, happy birthday!

8
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,930
Instead of a song, I'm gonna get a birthday rap.

9
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,390
I was gonna say, I'm holding off on songs for a minute.

10
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,970
Because of my voice.

11
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,290
But I can give you a rap.

12
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,370
Happy, happy birthday.

13
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,830
It's your birthday today.

14
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,250
Starrace, you're one year older and then you will have cake.

15
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,270
Yeah!

16
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,010
Happy birthday!

17
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,410
The train is coming and so have I.

18
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,750
I laughed last because you came to die.

19
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,030
Not the train!

20
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,070
Not the train!

21
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,190
Not the train!

22
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,710
You will have cake.

23
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,030
Yeah!

24
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,590
You will have cake!

25
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,890
Did I get a haircut?

26
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,680
I got a hair long.

27
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,080
That's what Mint looks like without the filter.

28
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:12,060
Starrace, you would still love me even if I were a 360 cam Vtuber, right?

29
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,200
Isn't that the camera that Francis uses?

30
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,190
This song is such a bop.

31
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,910
Anyway guys, welcome to Japan Train Models.

32
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,190
Which I think in the Japanese title is...

33
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,610
Densha Tetsudo?

34
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,970
Or Marugoto!

35
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,690
Marugoto!

36
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,830
Marugoto Tetsudo.

37
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,770
Foreigners like to manipulate images like this.

38
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,790
Except sometimes I do it myself.

39
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,630
Every aspect ratio.

40
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,790
This is me waiting for the train.

41
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,090
This is me waiting for the train.

42
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,670
Don't you want to see my reaction?

43
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,670
When the train comes?

44
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,350
I'm getting that British train spotter vibes.

45
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,140
I feel like I'm melting.

46
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,020
I feel like I've become... You know how people say cats are liquid?

47
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,440
That's how I feel.

48
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,060
Congrats on 350k?

49
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,340
Thank you!

50
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,700
Thank you so much!

51
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,880
This is the 350k stream.

52
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,720
I only know a little bit about this game.

53
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,900
I just wanted to hang out and play with some trains.

54
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,040
It's so good!

55
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,480
I'm turning 29 today.

56
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm still young, right?

57
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,920
Of course!

58
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,180
You need to rest your voice, but could you tell Chat that you're proud of us?

59
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,520
Chat...

60
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,340
Chat, I'm proud of you.

61
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,260
I'm proud of you, Chat.

62
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,620
I'm proud of you.

63
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,120
You're doing the thing.

64
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
And I'm proud of you for it.

65
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,370
Oh my god, I can make myself... Why is my cheek so...

66
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,470
I

67
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,220
have like a butt chin.

68
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,680
Oh

69
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,500
my...

70
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,820
Hold on, hold on.

71
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,480
Let me move over.

72
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,200
There we go.

73
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,980
I look like a hamster.

74
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,900
Now it looks like I have something stuck in my throat.

75
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,340
Potion seller.

76
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,380
No, I'm the guy that...

77
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,980
I'm the guy that watches the trains.

78
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
I'm the guy.

79
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,220
I'm the guy, you know?

80
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,020
The guy that does the train thing.

81
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,350
Show me your strongest potion.

82
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,170
No!

83
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,850
Masoken, happy birthday!

84
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,730
Happy, happy birthday.

85
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,290
Yeah, so this is probably gonna be not even the very long stream.

86
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:57,970
We'll see.

87
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:04,910
I might get into it, because there is like a creator part where you can like create your own train lines and stuff.

88
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,210
And I kinda just wanna take nice pictures and learn about trains, so I hope that's okay.

89
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,750
This is not like a... This is my own selfish kind of stream.

90
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,610
Thanks, Kaleidoscope Minky.

91
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,590
I

92
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,680
think pretty sure though this is a mobile game.

93
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,860
Oh my god.

94
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,020
Wow, look at it go!

95
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,060
Oh, the sound.

96
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,820
Oh wow, there's no like... Oh gosh, anybody who passes by is gonna die.

97
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,660
Dang, it's zooming.

98
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,420
The cherry blossoms!

99
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,900
Oh my gosh, that's such a nice... Oh my god.

100
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
Such a nice photo.

101
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,780
Okay, we're gonna get lots of good pictures.

102
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,280
So we have like... Look, we have encyclopedia where it tells you all about different trains.

103
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,300
Finish.

104
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,640
Wait, am I... Should I be playing this on controller?

105
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,620
Look, it tells you all about... Oh my gosh.

106
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,960
Wait, is this like the one with the green seats?

107
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,660
I've never sat in a green seat one because it costs extra.

108
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,020
What is this?

109
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,120
Okay, hold on.

110
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,550
On the 3D view... Oh my god, we can go inside!

111
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,370
Try observing the interior from the camera angle inside the vehicle.

112
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,870
Use the R... Okay, hold on.

113
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,550
Let me get my controller.

114
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,660
R stick to change the angle.

115
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Use the R button.

116
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,320
You never know what new discoveries you might make.

117
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,500
Wait, I can go in?

118
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, my bad.

119
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,300
Scroll up.

120
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,940
Scroll down.

121
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,260
Oh, it's talking about this.

122
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,720
Wait, how do I... How do I like...

123
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,620
Oh, there we go.

124
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,220
Camera move.

125
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,840
Okay, zoom out a little bit.

126
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,160
How do I go inside?

127
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,140
Maybe if I zoom in enough.

128
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,400
Enhance.

129
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,760
Take it.

130
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,780
Oh, train interior!

131
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,240
Oh my gosh.

132
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,910
This must be the green seats, no?

133
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,170
Wait.

134
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,630
Next camera.

135
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,070
There's the... There's the... Upstairs.

136
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,330
Oh my gosh, look how detailed this is.

137
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,150
Yes!

138
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,770
Green car ticket fair!

139
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,470
I've never been on this one because like as you can see, it costs more.

140
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,270
Like you have to get a separate ticket.

141
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,290
You can't just use your Suica or anything like that.

142
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,130
And then you can see...

143
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:25,630
If you go... If you go below 50 kilometers on weekdays, it's 1040 yen.

144
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,790
And on weekends and holidays, it's 840 yen.

145
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,090
Oh, that's kind of nice.

146
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,510
It's cheaper on weekends and holidays?

147
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,550
I feel like that's always the opposite, no?

148
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,950
You can tap Suica, but it's when you take the seat.

149
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,150
Okay, I see I've never done it before.

150
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,670
Thank you.

151
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,130
And then if you go over 51 kilometers, it's a little more pricey.

152
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,650
What's the... I can't read the stuff on this side though.

153
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,130
Oh.

154
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:51,950
Oh.

155
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:52,390
Oh.

156
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:52,850
Oh.

157
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,570
We enhanced too far.

158
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,480
I can't... I don't know.

159
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,100
I can't read it.

160
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,910
I don't think the train says that.

161
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,890
Please hold...

162
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,870
Please hold the handrail.

163
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,170
Please hold the handrail.

164
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,750
They got the harder one, security camera in operation.

165
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,030
That one I feel like is...

166
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,510
Is more difficult.

167
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,030
Hold my hand.

168
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,390
Don't do that.

169
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,870
Oh look, there's... Oh, the Mana Modo.

170
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,590
Oh yeah, these are all... Oh my gosh, these are all like legitimate signs that you see everywhere.

171
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,590
Instead of... Instead of like vibrate...

172
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,370
For phones, they call it Manor Mode.

173
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,170
Or not... Or like a silent mode, that's what I mean.

174
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,630
They call it... They call it Manor Mode.

175
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,190
Mana... Mana Modo.

176
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,010
Mana Modo.

177
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,730
That's why I'm like Manor Mode.

178
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,020
Watch for sudden stops.

179
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,200
I've never had a train stop suddenly before.

180
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,380
But I have been stuck on a train...

181
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,820
During a... What's the word?

182
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,620
During a earthquake.

183
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,620
Oh look at the tiny stabs.

184
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,720
Watch your step everybody.

185
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,220
Watch your step.

186
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,560
Please hold the handrail, okay?

187
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,610
Congrats on 315K, thank you!

188
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,530
My new model.

189
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,450
Wow, these seats look so comfy, no?

190
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,390
Wow, even the print on them.

191
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,830
Just... It's like not Leopard.

192
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,910
And they got the little tray tables.

193
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,530
It's like very much like a plane.

194
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,360
Green car.

195
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,420
What's next?

196
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,900
Oh, upstairs.

197
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,020
Oh these... Wow.

198
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,780
The colors are different.

199
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,900
Blue... Jaguar...

200
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,580
Leopard.

201
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,100
The handle is so strange.

202
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,540
Oh, this one has the little drink holder too.

203
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,600
It feels like we're... It feels like we're on the train, you guys.

204
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,500
Really feels like it.

205
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,120
Wait, I wanna go... Wait, where are we?

206
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,100
Is this a restroom?

207
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,480
Yup.

208
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,300
That's a wall.

209
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,620
I wanna get to the front, you know?

210
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,880
Wait, I think it's now repeating.

211
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,300
No, I wanted to see the front of the train!

212
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,360
Hold on.

213
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,520
Let's see.

214
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,120
Oh wait, maybe because...

215
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,120
It's only... Oh okay, this is just the passenger...

216
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,960
Car.

217
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,380
What does this do?

218
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,900
Oh, just kidding.

219
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,800
I think you need to switch cars.

220
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,460
I think so too.

221
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,760
Let's see, hold on.

222
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,480
Oh my gosh!

223
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,760
First year in service, 2008.

224
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,690
Does that mean he'll accept us even when we're freaky?

225
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,230
I don't know what this is in context to, but...

226
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,590
Yeah.

227
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,950
120 kilometers per hour.

228
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,250
These things are zooming.

229
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,770
These little trains.

230
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,930
Wait, what was the other one?

231
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,130
When was this in service from?

232
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,250
2008.

233
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,530
What's like the oldest one we've got here?

234
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,750
2008...2008...2008...2008...

235
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,200
2008...2008...

236
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,360
I think I've...Did I reset?

237
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,560
Actually, okay, I think I reset.

238
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,760
Yeah.

239
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,760
So there's only a few we got here.

240
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,440
Everything 2008.

241
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,540
Inside...

242
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:10,240
Oh no, these ones suck.

243
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,040
Wait, actually...

244
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,640
Oh, maybe...I don't think actually any of the JR...

245
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,900
The JR East...

246
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,200
I don't think any of these ones have the...

247
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,540
So some of them have like TV screens and some of them are just like the...

248
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,380
Like the scrolling text.

249
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,700
But this one looks like a TV screen.

250
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,160
Oh my gosh, all of these...All of these...

251
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,940
Are like the same exact signs you see...Oh my god!

252
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,580
It's the same exact signs!

253
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,340
I've never seen this before though.

254
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,320
Interesting.

255
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,960
Oh, Lumi!

256
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,600
Thank you for the raid!

257
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,540
Hi guys, we're looking at trains.

258
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,480
We built a deck.

259
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,000
We built a deck.

260
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,580
We built a deck.

261
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,160
Did you?

262
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,420
Is this the very model of a modern major train?

263
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,220
Yes, actually.

264
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,160
It's like the...

265
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,400
It's a door cock.

266
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,980
Yeah, and then, you know...

267
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,220
It might be like...

268
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,980
Oh, sometimes there's like no seats here for like strollers and all that.

269
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,920
Wheelchairs.

270
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,580
Emergency door opening.

271
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,530
What do you mean I'm extra freaky today?

272
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,950
I literally just read it.

273
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,070
That's what it says.

274
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,650
Door cock.

275
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,130
What?

276
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,450
But yeah, you know, sometimes you'll just be like minding your own business.

277
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:12,750
And then all the way right there, usually they are in the seats on the edge.

278
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,570
Because no one wants to be by them.

279
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:20,190
There'll just be some guy shitting and pissing and throwing up all over himself.

280
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,730
That Shibuya meltdown.

281
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,590
Wow, it makes it look so big.

282
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,810
Through my camera.

283
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:28,830
Wow.

284
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,490
It's just how it is.

285
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,230
Classic site.

286
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,470
Yeah, very classic.

287
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,210
Very classic!

288
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,570
What is this one?

289
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,010
Hold on.

290
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,970
Oh, okay, it's the same thing.

291
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,470
Just kidding.

292
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,430
Which one is your favorite?

293
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:57,910
Hold on.

294
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,790
Oh, there's the... there, there, there.

295
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,110
Hold on, hold on.

296
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,290
Do I have to like unlock more or...

297
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,770
Where am I?

298
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,430
I can't move!

299
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:16,930
Wait!

300
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,710
Oh my god, wait, wait!

301
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,410
Wait, wait!

302
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,750
Let me in!

303
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,070
Okay.

304
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,050
I wanna see!

305
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,310
I wanna see the controls!

306
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,930
I wanna be in the driver's seat!

307
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,690
I wanna be!

308
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,430
See, like, this screen looks really small...

309
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,850
To be...

310
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,090
To be a TV screen.

311
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,130
No, it looks thin.

312
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,170
Don't let her in.

313
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,070
Let me in.

314
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,910
Let me in.

315
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,250
I don't go on these ones very often.

316
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,410
The ones with these seats...

317
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:52,630
What?

318
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,150
What line is this on?

319
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,370
What line do you find these?

320
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,070
Gotta play Densha de GO!

321
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,050
I wanna play!

322
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,410
I wanna play Densha de GO.

323
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,060
What the heck?

324
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,680
What is over here?

325
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,220
This is so strange.

326
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,160
Tokaido line?

327
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,400
Tokaido line?

328
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,140
I think they are like this from Tokyo to Fuji-Q.

329
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:39,760
Really?

330
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,100
I've always taken the bus to Fuji-Q.

331
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,160
Do you not take a Shinkansen?

332
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,780
I guess that would be faster.

333
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,040
Shonan Shinjuku as well.

334
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,140
I can't see anything!

335
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,840
This is the worst camera angle ever!

336
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,360
I always like to wave at the guys when I look out the window though.

337
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,140
Shonan Shinjuku.

338
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,070
I want to see inside.

339
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,270
Maybe they are like, we can't show you.

340
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,430
It will give away our secrets.

341
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,530
How many trains for Fuji-Q?

342
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,130
It's like two expresses a day or something.

343
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,810
Oh, really?

344
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,810
There is no Shinkansen to Fuji-Q though.

345
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,130
No, you can take...

346
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,370
Well, it's not like two Fuji-Q trains.

347
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,510
But it's to the area.

348
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,470
Taking the bus to Fuji-Q.

349
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,550
YouTubers.

350
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,590
The YouTubers will break in.

351
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:45,530
No!

352
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,930
I wonder if you can see...

353
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,030
Oh, look at that.

354
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,710
Hold on.

355
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,290
These ones don't seem to have like the air conditioning under the...

356
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,330
In the winter time, the seats, they will have like a heat underneath.

357
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,630
And they make your legs toasty.

358
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,310
Uh-oh, is YouTube going down?

359
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,510
Lightbulb, Headed Minto, share your wisdom.

360
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,020
If you gotta go, then you should go.

361
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,860
It's fine now?

362
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,160
These like little privacy seats are so funny.

363
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,920
But you have so much less sitting room.

364
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,720
It kinda sucks.

365
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,920
Or maybe it's the same.

366
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,820
But I would feel awkward sitting and staring at someone like that.

367
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,180
I don't know how I would feel about that.

368
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,400
I already feel bad because if I'm sitting and like looking out the window...

369
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,920
But someone is across from me, they already think I'm looking at them.

370
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,160
Which one haven't we looked at?

371
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,000
We looked at this one.

372
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,280
E233.

373
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,010
It literally says Shonan Shinjuku Line.

374
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,330
You guys are so smart.

375
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,110
And Ueno Tokyo Line, etc.

376
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,130
Ah!

377
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,990
3000 series.

378
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,330
232.

379
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,810
Kuha?

380
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,050
Moha?

381
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,470
What's it say up there?

382
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,800
It's the local...

383
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,220
Takasaki desu.

384
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,840
Takasaki desu.

385
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,320
It's inverted controls.

386
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,800
This is...

387
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,580
Not the one we were just in.

388
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,720
But we were in this one before.

389
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,620
I wish they told us a little bit more about the cars.

390
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,590
You can see everything underneath too.

391
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,090
All the bits and parts.

392
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,150
Company secrets.

393
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,250
The doors on the right side will open.

394
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,630
They're trains.

395
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,270
You know what I mean.

396
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,870
The cars.

397
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,930
This is the car.

398
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,670
The train car.

399
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,680
Yeah, this is a car stream actually.

400
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,660
Hi, Vet.

401
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,580
Lumi4Face is very nice.

402
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,620
Thank you, your time.

403
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,340
Thank you, your super chat.

404
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,400
I wanna see, I wanna learn all the bits and pieces.

405
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,060
I've never seen this either.

406
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,300
I've never seen these buttons.

407
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,540
Oh gosh, it won't let me zoom up anymore.

408
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,580
But, there we go.

409
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,380
Ah, yes.

410
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,770
I guess, oh, it's just opening the door.

411
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,590
I've never seen these buttons before.

412
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,250
Push it.

413
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,910
They light up so nice, right?

414
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,330
I wonder where I could go to take this.

415
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,330
Is this also to Takasaki?

416
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:45,950
Yup.

417
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,710
I wonder where I could go.

418
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,890
I guess to Takasaki.

419
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,570
What is in Takasaki?

420
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,750
Let's see.

421
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:53,490
I'm gonna Google.

422
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,730
What is in Takasaki?

423
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,150
Japan, Takasaki.

424
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,500
The stream is truly built for me and my train's special interest.

425
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,080
Thank you, Vet.

426
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,560
Of course.

427
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,260
Also, Hero Juggler, I'm sorry I missed you.

428
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,100
Megamind, Minto defeats Chilly Minto.

429
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,260
And Rockin' and Gaming, thank you!

430
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,480
Oh, wait, Joshua.

431
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,400
StreamLive now forces my email, so I feel like I should note that.

432
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,140
Have you ever heard of Densha de GO?

433
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,960
I have!

434
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,080
Actually, my friend has a Densha de GO cab, so...

435
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,100
Hometown of Daruma Doll?

436
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,800
No way.

437
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,540
It's in Gunma.

438
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,860
Wait, maybe I'm looking up the wrong Takasaki.

439
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,840
It's telling...

440
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,820
Oh, wait, no, just kidding.

441
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,980
What is Takasaki, Japan, known for?

442
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,540
Close to Tokyo and Nagano, the city of Takasaki is best known for two things.

443
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,740
Steam, locomotives, and Daruma Dolls.

444
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,260
Oh my gosh, we can actually choo-choo.

445
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,780
We can actually chugga-chugga-choo-choo.

446
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,000
Show us the cab.

447
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,000
It's not mine, it's my friend's.

448
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,440
You guys, how many chuggas do you do?

449
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,320
I do 8 chuggas.

450
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,400
I saw some people in the pre-chat, they were like, I do 6 chuggas.

451
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,820
I do...

452
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,220
I do 15...

453
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,140
Or...

454
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,240
I do 8.

455
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,860
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo.

456
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,340
I think that just feels...

457
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,860
The best amount.

458
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,680
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo.

459
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,500
Why Minto Concave?

460
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,960
This is my special camera.

461
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,900
I try to be inconsistent.

462
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,700
4 feels right, I feel like that's too small.

463
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,120
No, you gotta have the build-up.

464
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,740
Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo.

465
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,300
I've been a fan and a follower since the good old Doom days.

466
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh my gosh, Francisco, thank you.

467
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,040
I actually got sad last year...

468
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,340
Because I thought I'll never hear you sing happy birthday which is today!

469
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,420
But now, here we are.

470
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,800
We're alive kind of, I'm making full.

471
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Well...

472
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,080
Francisco, I wasn't going to be singing birthday songs for a bit...

473
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,540
Because my throat was kind of messed up.

474
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,120
But since you've been waiting for so long...

475
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,740
Since Doom...

476
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,940
I will sing.

477
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,920
Happy birthday to you.

478
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,140
Happy birthday to you.

479
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,540
Happy birthday, dear Francisco.

480
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,780
Happy birthday to you.

481
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,520
Happy birthday!

482
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,480
Depends on the context.

483
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,800
Sometimes it's a small chugga.

484
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,280
Sometimes it's long, but like they say, length is not what's important.

485
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,520
I think it is.

486
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
In this context?

487
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,020
In what context would you not want a good chugga buildup?

488
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,460
I should be finishing packing for Japan.

489
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,620
But instead I'm watching a comfy stream about trains that I'll be riding later.

490
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,100
Oh my gosh, wait.

491
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,420
You're gonna literally be like...

492
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,720
You're gonna... Wait, how do I get inside?

493
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,200
Wait, let me in.

494
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,900
How do I get inside again?

495
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,280
How do I get inside again?

496
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,300
Why is it not letting me inside?

497
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,240
Hold on.

498
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,600
Oh, there's more!

499
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,660
Wait, we were just at this one!

500
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,780
Oh my gosh.

501
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,880
Oh, I pressed the back button.

502
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,300
My bad.

503
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,860
Wait, wait, wait.

504
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,580
I don't want to do puzzle mode yet.

505
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,920
Wait, back, back, back.

506
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,500
Back, back, back.

507
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,340
Encyclopedia.

508
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,560
Oh my gosh!

509
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,220
Wait, I think this... Yes!

510
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,580
I was gonna say this is the one that I'm most used to.

511
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,840
I'm so... Oh my gosh!

512
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,260
This face is iconic.

513
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,540
Oh my god!

514
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,600
It's the Yamanote-sen!

515
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:23,720
When?

516
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,180
It's iconic.

517
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,320
Since 2016.

518
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,080
Oh.

519
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,960
Hello, Butaro.

520
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,980
Are you tired of hearing me talk?

521
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,000
Are you tired of hearing me talk?

522
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,880
My cats are in here.

523
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,460
Both of them, they were sleeping together.

524
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,160
Oh!

525
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:47,820
Oh!

526
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,880
Oh my gosh!

527
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,000
This is how they do the announcements and...

528
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,060
Oh my gosh, I want to know everything!

529
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,560
I want to play Densha de GO!

530
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,300
I want to play!

531
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,780
Oh, I wish I could see outside!

532
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,080
Look, this one is red.

533
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,340
The other one was yellow.

534
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,720
I wonder if it gets... I read...

535
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,280
I wonder how stressful to comforting this job is, you know?

536
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,040
I love the creeper seats.

537
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,200
I love the creeper seats!

538
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh my gosh, this is like so...

539
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,120
See?

540
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:39,460
See?

541
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:39,600
See?

542
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:39,900
See?

543
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,000
This is what I meant by the screens and everything.

544
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,460
Yes!

545
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
These are the TV screens.

546
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,460
That's just a Minecraft creeper.

547
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,380
Oh my gosh, you can even see the butt imprint.

548
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,880
This is too realistic.

549
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,940
This is too realistic, I fear.

550
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,280
All those salarymen that have sat here...

551
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,220
Priority seat.

552
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,410
I'm pretty sure these all...

553
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,670
Wait, can I go inside?

554
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,350
Let me in, please.

555
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,770
Let me in, please.

556
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,170
I'm gonna just be a creeper from outdoors.

557
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:52,590
Yamagote.

558
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,670
Yamagote.

559
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,970
I don't know, I...

560
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,150
Personally...

561
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,250
I mean, I know that Yamagote is so convenient because it goes to so many places.

562
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,470
Also, it just gets so crowded.

563
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:17,820
Us?

564
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,740
Wait, where did that comment go?

565
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,960
Wait, hold on.

566
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,200
Oh.

567
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,760
Basically means unmotored trailer car.

568
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,240
Ah, I see, I see.

569
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,400
So then...

570
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,460
So then the kuha...

571
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,840
Would be if it's motored?

572
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,240
But then what's a moha?

573
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,920
Kuha means cat.

574
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,100
So you guys are teaching me more about this than the game.

575
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,960
Hold on, let me let my cat out.

576
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,100
Moha means mode.

577
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,820
That makes sense.

578
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,420
Wait, no, wait, oh.

579
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,230
Oh, wait, hold on.

580
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,280
This...

581
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,560
Then you can do funny stuff like a kumoha is a motored cat.

582
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,940
Why won't it let me inside?

583
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,740
Priority seating.

584
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,580
This is the one we went in before though.

585
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,800
Oh, I guess we can't go in this one.

586
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,760
Maybe they're just like it's the same exactly.

587
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,400
Can't say cause clash.

588
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,560
But dang, that's a big forehead.

589
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,100
Oh my gosh, wait, what if I do this?

590
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,530
It becomes a little concave.

591
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,450
It becomes a little concave.

592
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,170
Wait, hold on, now I wanna see.

593
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,320
So salo, I'm guessing is like the double decker ones then.

594
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,680
And the moha.

595
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,520
And you can see up here.

596
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,300
And then...

597
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,380
There's a translation there, it's supposed to be salo.

598
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:56,980
Oh my gosh.

599
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,140
Nasa Nyeru knows so much.

600
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,760
I'm learning so much, thank you.

601
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,380
This is so awesome.

602
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,260
So it's salo instead.

603
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,920
Well, I guess...

604
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,740
Salo, salo.

605
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,240
Trailer green car.

606
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,300
Okay, okay.

607
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,780
Maybe it's short for saloon.

608
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,500
I'm gonna look at that.

609
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:24,920
Hold on.

610
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,480
We're learning about trains today, everybody.

611
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,510
Wait, 3000 series, here we go.

612
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,540
I see it.

613
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,580
I see it.

614
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,560
That's cool.

615
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,960
Cool ha moha moha moha.

616
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,080
Oh, it's like showing me.

617
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,700
Wait, like the formation.

618
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,300
So it would be like kuha moha moha moha moha.

619
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,180
Salo, salo.

620
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,440
Moha moha kuha.

621
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,820
But wait, I wanna see what salo stands for.

622
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:41,950
I don't like it.

623
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:42,410
Row

624
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,560
is green car, ha is normal car.

625
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,190
I guess in this game, lol.

626
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,710
Lol.

627
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,170
Lol lol lol.

628
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,280
Tributing to the Abydos Trans Desert Railway.

629
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,500
Thank you.

630
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,840
Oh, it even says like what lines it does.

631
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm on Wikipedia.

632
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,100
Sorry, hold on.

633
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,360
Now I can't stop reading.

634
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,560
Okay, I need to stop reading.

635
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,180
Hold on.

636
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,860
We still have...

637
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,480
This series too.

638
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,100
You look a little different today.

639
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,640
Did you change your hair?

640
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,540
I wonder how it looks with twin tails.

641
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,180
Round.

642
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,920
Why does it look even more round like this?

643
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,820
Why does it look even more round?

644
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,540
Odoriko.

645
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,830
Why is it so bright in my eyes?

646
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,870
Oh, golly.

647
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,850
It's so stinking bright.

648
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,230
Oh my gosh.

649
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:23,710
Stop.

650
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,290
It's so cute.

651
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,450
I look like I belong in here.

652
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,070
Why is this so cute?

653
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:33,930
Kuha.

654
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,990
It even says Kuha here.

655
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,050
Oh my gosh.

656
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,990
It's so cute.

657
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,850
It's a mint color.

658
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,490
Not gonna lie, at first I thought that was like a...

659
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,310
Like a place to brew tea or coffee.

660
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,350
You got the little phone and then the little spinning...

661
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,050
Wait, let's see.

662
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,270
In here.

663
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:11,570
A little privacy before you go into the...

664
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,370
Main car.

665
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,000
Okay, so these are...

666
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,640
You don't... You can just sit wherever.

667
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,980
So, car...

668
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,960
Trains sometimes like this have assigned seating, but then there's also like...

669
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,920
It's like free seating, but it's also like first come, first serve.

670
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,330
You know, overtime is expected when there's a built-in espresso machine.

671
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:43,670
Yeah.

672
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,990
You should totally play Densha Dego.

673
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:51,930
I want to!

674
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,960
Wait, hold on.

675
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,820
185 series.

676
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,880
That can rock a rabbit!

677
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,980
Congrats on the 350K and one year reopening membership.

678
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,400
It's also my birthday!

679
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,820
Last year, my superchat got lost in a sea of new bamboos.

680
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,900
No need to strain your voice doing a slam poetry style MGSB day.

681
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,680
You can just tell me I'm...

682
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,420
Pretty old.

683
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,760
No, no!

684
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,480
Rock for rabbit!

685
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,700
I will sing you a happy birthday.

686
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,420
You waited since last year.

687
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,740
I'm sorry that I got lost.

688
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,600
I'm sorry!

689
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,420
Happy birthday to you.

690
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,980
Happy birthday to you.

691
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,460
Happy birthday, rock for rabbit.

692
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:04,500
Happy birthday, you're pretty old.

693
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,720
Sorry that I'm doing it in this song.

694
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,100
In this look.

695
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,060
Why is it so bright?

696
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:24,440
So then this one's also a green car.

697
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,480
Oh yeah, there's a symbol.

698
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,120
Oh my gosh, it's so bright.

699
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,960
Everything is like reflecting like crazy.

700
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,720
That's a sasato.

701
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,720
I learned.

702
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,200
I learned.

703
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:35,620
I learned.

704
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,100
I'm learned.

705
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:36,780
I learned.

706
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,680
I took what I learned and I'm applying it.

707
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,000
Moha!

708
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,180
So I'm just confirming... I know this is like...

709
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,200
This isn't like the motor part of the moha, is it?

710
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,980
Because I know it's like the electricity blah blah.

711
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,500
I actually don't know.

712
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,000
I know like...

713
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,640
My head is melting.

714
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,400
Yeah, a little bit.

715
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,940
Sometimes when you're going about your day, do you get the DuckTales theme song popping in your head?

716
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:12,500
Sometimes.

717
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,040
It's called a pentagraph.

718
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,520
Oh, it touches the wire.

719
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

720
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,040
Hold on, I'm gonna look it up.

721
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:31,710
On the train.

722
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:32,470
Transport.

723
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:33,050
Here we go.

724
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:40,630
Apparatus mounted onto the roof of an electric train, tram, or trolleybuses to collect power through contact with an overhead line.

725
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:43,530
Oh...

726
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:50,290
The term stems from the resemblance of some styles to the mechanical pentagraphs used for...

727
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:50,910
Oh!

728
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:52,830
Oh my gosh!

729
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,110
I see it!

730
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,910
That's cra... Oh my gosh!

731
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:58,530
Wait...

732
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:04,910
I saw... This is actually like kind of a trend kind of right now is...

733
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:12,150
Using like a pentagraph to... Well, it's not exactly a pentagraph.

734
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:16,430
It's a little different, but something similar to like...

735
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:23,490
Scratch images into graphite and... Or not... What was it?

736
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:24,230
It wasn't graphite.

737
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,650
It was granite.

738
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,390
But I saw it!

739
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,950
I saw like people trying to do it.

740
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:36,430
And like when you then...

741
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,470
When you then...

742
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,750
When you like move the...

743
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,670
It's not glass.

744
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:47,570
It was something.

745
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,610
Yeah, you like make a hologram basically.

746
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:52,610
It's really cool, actually.

747
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,370
I got an achievement!

748
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,490
Oh, for playing more than one hour!

749
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:18,950
What?

750
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,730
Wait... What are the achievements?

751
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,050
There's 13 achievements in this game.

752
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:37,190
Marutetsu Mini... Oh, I got the fan achievement.

753
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,130
Only 25% of players have this achievement.

754
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,300
Okay.

755
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,840
We will play the game.

756
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,180
I'm just so fascinated with like the models.

757
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:00,840
Sorry.

758
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,440
Sorry.

759
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,840
There's a game?

760
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,520
A little bit.

761
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,260
Yeah, actually.

762
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,040
Shall we go check it out?

763
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,160
Oh, wait.

764
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,440
Back.

765
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,760
So we did the 185 series.

766
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,100
We did the E2333000 series.

767
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,920
And we did the E235 series.

768
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,860
What is... Oh, this is I think the... You can build your own.

769
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,520
Let's go to puzzle.

770
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,600
So is it just a puzzle?

771
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,120
I can do... Futsu?

772
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,380
These are so cute.

773
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,320
It looks like a little model.

774
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,580
Actually, it's so cute with the little snippers and everything.

775
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,080
Oh my gosh.

776
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,040
Wait, let's try it.

777
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,720
Futsu... Futsu... Futsu... Normal... Normal...

778
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,110
There's so many.

779
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,130
Oh my gosh.

780
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:29,970
It's train Gunpla.

781
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:35,090
Wait, I'm gonna not use my controller for this.

782
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,290
No way.

783
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,530
The base of the model is shown at the top of the screen.

784
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,150
And the parts for the model are shown at the bottom.

785
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,610
Use the R L button to rotate.

786
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,050
Okay, maybe I do need to use my controller.

787
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:51,470
To rotate the base in 90 degree increments to find the correct angle and position, place the parts.

788
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,850
Select the part and move it to the spot where you think it fits.

789
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:03,850
On the left side of the screen, you will find a number of features that will come in handy while assembling models.

790
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:07,650
There is no limit to how many times they can be used, so try them out as much as you like.

791
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:09,030
So nice.

792
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:09,710
Masashi.

793
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:15,610
There's also a 2D model stage and a timer, so keep challenging yourself to achieve the fastest time possible.

794
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,130
Okay, so we're making this.

795
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,180
Why did it feel like it got louder?

796
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,280
This music is like so...

797
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,720
Okay, hold on.

798
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,220
So now I take you...

799
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,920
And I rotate it.

800
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,200
How?

801
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,040
Oh, I can do like that.

802
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,520
There we go.

803
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,020
Okay, okay.

804
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,880
So I rotate the full thing.

805
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,980
And then that was on the other side I saw.

806
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,340
Right here.

807
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,360
Okay.

808
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,520
Oh.

809
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,660
Oh my god.

810
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,900
Wait, zoom mode.

811
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,940
Oh, I see.

812
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,280
Okay.

813
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,380
Okay, okay.

814
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,180
We're making it.

815
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,700
Oh, that's so helpful.

816
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,680
I'm guessing...

817
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,540
Oh, no, no, no, no.

818
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:22,880
Sorry.

819
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,290
There we go.

820
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,090
Okay, confirm.

821
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,200
Well, it kind of like cheats, no?

822
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,960
It tells you where to place it.

823
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,100
It kind of tells you where to place it.

824
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,180
And then this, I imagine, goes there.

825
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,780
And then this on top.

826
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:54,490
Friendship ended with Gunpla, now Denpla is my new best friend.

827
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,810
I wonder how the hard one is then.

828
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:00,750
Like, do you... Does it not give you any hints?

829
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:01,850
Let's try.

830
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,770
We've already done this one, so we're in X.

831
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:12,210
It's even more... And look at that, it even tells you what part...

832
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,650
What each thing is.

833
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,970
So we're ma... Oh, wow, okay.

834
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:21,370
Oh, it still does kind of tell you though.

835
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,150
Like, if I just wander around enough...

836
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:25,970
Will it show me?

837
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,430
Maybe not.

838
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,270
Okay, okay, okay.

839
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,930
Oh, it's on the front there.

840
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,250
Oh, because you need to like rotate it.

841
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:39,710
So it's like not so obvious sometimes.

842
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:41,930
Aha!

843
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,470
Okay, okay, okay.

844
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,330
So this is like the thing we made earlier.

845
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:50,510
Well, I guess... Okay, hold on.

846
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,550
Well, this was like in the middle, no?

847
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,110
Place?

848
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:56,450
Place?

849
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:58,390
Place it?

850
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,010
Place it?

851
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:01,250
Places?

852
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,350
Place it?

853
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:03,630
Place it?

854
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:05,890
Congrats

855
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:12,950
on the new DK!

856
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,430
You can overtake all the other trains and win the train race.

857
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,470
Yippee!

858
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,130
See?

859
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:21,710
Oh, why would it want this first?

860
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:22,470
That's so interesting.

861
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:27,930
And then we know.

862
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,030
We know, we know.

863
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,310
Oh, we even have to assemble the...

864
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,010
The inside.

865
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:35,570
Aha.

866
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,310
So these are the...

867
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,550
Those are the doorway.

868
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:42,510
Wait, what's this one?

869
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:43,610
Oh, at the very end.

870
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:43,970
Okay.

871
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:47,430
Haha!

872
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:53,250
And then this is exactly... Wait, this is exactly as it was before.

873
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,890
But it's not letting me move for some reason.

874
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:57,310
Oh, there we go.

875
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,950
I wonder

876
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:08,830
what the difference is between those.

877
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,420
Hard mode.

878
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,600
Look how many pieces there are.

879
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,250
And then you... I'm sorry, how big is this?

880
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:33,650
Wow!

881
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,710
No way!

882
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,100
Wow!

883
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,500
It looks so nice.

884
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,000
I would love a model like this.

885
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,280
Like, not to like rag on the... Just the train models themselves, but like an actual...

886
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:04,000
You know, setting and everything like this would be so nice.

887
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,880
Like, yeah, like a whole diorama, exactly.

888
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,020
Where is Shirokane-Sando Bridge?

889
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,400
Shirokane-Sando Bashi, doko?

890
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,900
Shirokane-Sando Bridge.

891
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:28,310
It did say that maybe some locations are different due to privacy, but...

892
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,940
I think they wouldn't name it if it weren't...

893
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,020
It's in Shinagawa!

894
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,160
I'm gonna go!

895
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,620
How'd that one bookcase one go?

896
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,400
Oh, it's good!

897
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,400
I didn't finish it.

898
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,640
I did end up finishing it.

899
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,220
It's just hard to take a picture because it's kind of reflective.

900
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,700
I like trains.

901
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,080
I love... Actually, there's... Oh, wait.

902
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,500
I don't know if this...

903
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,560
I don't think it was trains now that I think about it.

904
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,180
It might have been cars.

905
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:14,540
There's a, like, little toy shop in Haneda Airport where you can race cars.

906
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,740
I don't think it was trains.

907
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,500
But there's also an airplane.

908
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,820
And it's not just, like, an airplane store.

909
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,740
It's, like, a fighter jet store in the Haneda Airport.

910
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:32,180
And it's... I don't know if it's run by the guy with the YouTube channel, but it's run by, like, an ex...

911
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,660
He was, like, part of... Oh, gosh.

912
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,140
Sorry, my brain is so...

913
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:42,090
But I saw him!

914
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:45,430
I saw him last time I was at the airport.

915
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,730
I was like, oh my gosh, that's the guy!

916
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,850
It's upstairs and to the left, right?

917
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:51,250
Yes!

918
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,390
Yes, yes, yes.

919
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:53,110
You're right, Todd.

920
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,290
It is, it is, it is.

921
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:54,970
Yeah.

922
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:56,890
So it's really cool, actually.

923
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:00,010
They sell, like, you know, actual...

924
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,340
Which one is it?

925
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,520
What is it?

926
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,120
What is it?

927
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,500
Haneda... Where's your store list?

928
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,460
And it's not like... It's not like, you know, like...

929
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,700
Passenger planes or commercial planes or anything like that.

930
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,840
It's like... It's like...

931
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,480
Like jets and, you know... It's fun.

932
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,760
I like to go in there and peruse.

933
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,800
I'll find it.

934
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,340
I'll find it.

935
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,760
Do they still have that udon place?

936
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,420
I'm pretty sure they still have an udon place in there.

937
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,680
Lots and lots of jets and planes.

938
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:14,780
And one of my favorite things about Haneda is the observatory deck that they have.

939
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:15,580
I'm crying.

940
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,040
Not the train guy for you.

941
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,960
Today, I'm here.

942
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,400
Wait, that's... That's not the guy.

943
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,680
I'm like... I'm like fusing the train guy, Francis, and...

944
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,380
What's his name?

945
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,260
Tom Scott.

946
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:46,580
Did you manage to fix your stream deck?

947
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,900
Yeah, I think it actually... It didn't do it today, so it's actually good.

948
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,820
He does look like Tom Scott, though.

949
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,660
And they're both British.

950
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,540
Osaka airport as a Kamen Rider-ish mascot?

951
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,040
Wait, I wanna see this.

952
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,480
I'm gonna look it up.

953
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:08,820
Hold on.

954
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,240
Osaka airport mascot.

955
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,420
Wait a second.

956
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,680
I don't think...

957
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,580
I think... Is he new?

958
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,680
Because this one is so...

959
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,680
This guy is so cute.

960
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:28,840
Wait a second.

961
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,060
How old is this?

962
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,840
Oh my gosh, he's so... Look at this guy!

963
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:35,860
Hold on.

964
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,660
This is like a... It looks like a Twitter post, but I'm just gonna show you guys anyway.

965
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:42,540
Because this is... The picture of him is so stinking cute.

966
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:43,900
Look at him!

967
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,030
He's Sorayan.

968
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,290
Sorayan is his name.

969
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:56,330
He's so cute.

970
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:59,930
Not that one.

971
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,070
I didn't think so.

972
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:02,870
But he's so cute.

973
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,660
Look at his little...

974
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,320
He's so cute.

975
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,060
Where is the Kamen Rider one?

976
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,120
It's not this guy, is it?

977
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,880
Is it this guy?

978
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,660
Miyaku Miyaku!

979
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,720
Is it Miyaku Miyaku?

980
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,820
Osaka's mascot with rolling eyeballs and sunflower-like head?

981
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,610
It's Miyaku Miyaku.

982
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:50,270
I can't find it.

983
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:52,090
Did they retire him?

984
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,950
I feel like there would be some pictures of him though.

985
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,070
If you know his name...

986
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:01,690
Dosei.

987
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:06,510
The Osaka Kamen Rider... Osaka Airport Kamen Rider mascot.

988
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:10,770
Rapid... Till Dyer.

989
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:11,950
That?

990
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,400
Oh my gosh!

991
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,280
The Japanese... Oh, it says spawn from a train.

992
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,400
Oh my gosh!

993
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:32,440
Oh my gosh!

994
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,560
Sorry, I'm saving things.

995
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,020
And I was like, do you want to re-save?

996
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,660
Look at that!

997
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,780
I was born to protect the peace of Osaka!

998
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,840
That's awesome!

999
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,180
Oh my god!

1000
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,840
What train is he?

1001
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,160
What train is he?

1002
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,040
Okay...

1003
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:11,940
Oh!

1004
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,180
Wait, you can see it!

1005
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,390
Oh, I mean it's behind him, but like...

1006
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,180
You can see it much better in this picture.

1007
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,460
It looks so much like him!

1008
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:26,900
Like, actually!

1009
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,580
It looks so good!

1010
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,420
Retro... Oh no, that's surprise.

1011
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,020
What is this?

1012
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:35,220
Okay.

1013
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:40,020
Ranger-esque superhero modeled after the Rapid train line in Osaka...

1014
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,940
Which runs between the Kansai International Airport and Namba Station.

1015
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,720
Oh, Rapid...

1016
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,000
Comes from the German word for rapid.

1017
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,380
They made the train look like Squidward.

1018
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,160
The resemblance is truly uncanny.

1019
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,620
That's so good!

1020
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:04,340
That's so good.

1021
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,940
I wonder what Easy is then.

1022
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,900
Oh, there's not even that many things we could build.

1023
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:09,900
Let's try this one.

1024
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,180
I want to see what this one is like, building on Easy.

1025
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,480
Oh.

1026
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,240
Wait, this is too easy.

1027
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,380
Wait a second!

1028
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,860
What do you think I am?

1029
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,420
Am I a joke to you?

1030
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,320
Actually, how do I get it in there?

1031
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,060
Oh, there it is.

1032
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,590
Wait.

1033
01:05:59,290 --> 01:05:59,690
Wait.

1034
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:00,450
Oh my gosh.

1035
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,770
Wait, this is like the best...

1036
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,520
Wait, frame me from here instead.

1037
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,730
Wait, I want to see the front.

1038
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:34,370
Wait, what is this?

1039
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:35,670
How cute.

1040
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,410
I want this diorama.

1041
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,610
I want this diorama.

1042
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,640
Oh my gosh, next time I go to Japan, I'm coming here.

1043
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,840
I'm going to come here.

1044
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:54,140
Wait.

1045
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,560
Hold on, hold on.

1046
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:08,620
Revert!

1047
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,480
Tease!

1048
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:33,220
Wait.

1049
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:35,500
Tease!

1050
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:36,940
Tease!

1051
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,620
I'm going to try to recreate this picture.

1052
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,120
I'm going to try to recreate this picture.

1053
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:45,360
You must be a conductor, the way you pilot my heart.

1054
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,540
Oh, I have a... hold on.

1055
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,360
I have a conductor hat.

1056
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:19,400
All aboard!

1057
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,640
Okay, if you guys ever go to... what was this bridge called?

1058
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:26,260
I don't remember.

1059
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,600
Hold on, I have it.

1060
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,580
Shirokane Sando Bashi.

1061
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:35,560
The Shirokane Sando Bridge.

1062
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,640
You must stand here with your minto to go plushie.

1063
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:41,160
And you must take a picture.

1064
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,600
Or if I ever have an acrylic stand or something.

1065
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,140
Look at me.

1066
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,860
I'm the conductor now.

1067
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,660
You must recreate this photo, okay?

1068
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:56,060
Here, I'll even write it on the screen for you.

1069
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:08,230
Shirokane Sando Bridge.

1070
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:20,630
Wait, why'd it get so small?

1071
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,580
One hand?

1072
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,740
Please hold.

1073
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,440
Here.

1074
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,160
There, there, there.

1075
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,360
I shall bring a full-size cardboard minto standee.

1076
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:49,980
Crazy.

1077
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,000
Did someone say sandwich?

1078
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,720
Yeah, the Shirokane Sandwich Bridge.

1079
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:02,560
Actually, there was a kanji, but I didn't see what the kanji was.

1080
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,960
Hold on, maybe we can see it.

1081
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:05,280
Hold on.

1082
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,640
It was over here, no?

1083
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,060
Shirokane...

1084
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:18,800
Oh gosh.

1085
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,560
It just says something.

1086
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,160
I can't read the middle one.

1087
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,480
Something way bridge.

1088
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:33,190
Sando.

1089
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:35,870
White gold.

1090
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,160
Kane as in money?

1091
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:42,880
Yep, yep.

1092
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,460
This is such a nice photo.

1093
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,640
Wait, I want to kind of like...

1094
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,100
This is so like...

1095
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,160
Oh, just my...

1096
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,440
Oh, it's like...

1097
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,040
I want kind of with like the everyday-isms too, you know?

1098
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,760
Like the signs and all that.

1099
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,440
Get everything in there.

1100
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,500
So scenic.

1101
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,040
So scenic!

1102
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,760
And then this one.

1103
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:49,840
Oh no!

1104
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,520
I followed the wrong road!

1105
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,260
Oh no!

1106
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,060
Oh no!

1107
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,360
Can't believe I get to watch Mito build the train.

1108
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,960
That goes to Gotanda.

1109
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,180
The doors on the right side will open.

1110
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,800
Please change here for...

1111
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:15,380
The Keihin-Tohoku line, the Ginza line and the... Wait, she says Keihin-Tohoku last, no?

1112
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,570
I'm pulling the lever.

1113
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:32,230
Stop the train!

1114
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:35,350
She's on that!

1115
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,550
She's down there!

1116
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,890
Look out behind you!

1117
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,090
Alright, there's one last thing I did want to do in this.

1118
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:54,410
Oh wait, that was just one... Oh my gosh, there's other...

1119
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:55,710
Nevermind, hold on.

1120
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:00,070
I want to see what the diagram...

1121
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:02,210
Stop!

1122
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:06,510
It's so nice!

1123
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:07,490
Oh my God!

1124
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:10,770
It's so nice!

1125
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,950
Wait, what is this supposed to look like?

1126
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:19,910
Oh my God!

1127
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,030
Oh, I see it now.

1128
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,980
It's not supposed to be turned a little bit.

1129
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,400
It's like... Are you seeing this?

1130
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,080
Oh, there we go.

1131
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:33,800
Yeah, that's right.

1132
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,020
And then all the rocks and the ocean!

1133
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:45,010
She sees the vision.

1134
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,580
It's so nice!

1135
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,620
Oh my God!

1136
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,660
Sorry, I'm obsessed.

1137
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,540
Wait!

1138
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,660
Oh my God, hold on.

1139
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,800
You're just walking along, living your little...

1140
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:13,660
So...

1141
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,180
I

1142
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,060
want this diorama!

1143
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,240
Oh wow!

1144
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,620
You're just walking along, living your little...

1145
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:26,920
Oh wait, we gotta be even smaller.

1146
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,300
How tall is it?

1147
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:29,740
Wow!

1148
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,540
Just living your little life.

1149
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,520
Well, I'm dead, but you know...

1150
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:40,800
Can't see it from here.

1151
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,300
Ooh!

1152
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:48,450
What is... What's the view from up here?

1153
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,500
Oh my God, I'm the conductor.

1154
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:10,500
Oh my God!

1155
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,860
I should have played this in 3D.

1156
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,380
I should have played this with my 3D model.

1157
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:24,940
Wow!

1158
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,020
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1159
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,660
I wish it was a little easier to move around.

1160
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:33,740
Yeah!

1161
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,380
Choo-choo!

1162
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:40,820
Cab ride.

1163
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,950
Empty.

1164
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:58,270
They're like, can I show you the toilet secrets?

1165
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:58,390
Nice.

1166
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,560
How many is it?

1167
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,040
Oh, four.

1168
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:09,380
Occupied!

1169
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,720
It's so detailed.

1170
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,200
Is this like to get in here?

1171
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,640
It's so nice!

1172
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,800
It's so stinking nice.

1173
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:43,320
A ghost train.

1174
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,660
Oh my God!

1175
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,080
Wow!

1176
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,320
Wait, hold on.

1177
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,600
I can see why people get into model train sets.

1178
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,220
From the park.

1179
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,560
You can probably see it from the top.

1180
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:05,760
Ah!

1181
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:06,900
Just barely.

1182
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:07,520
Oh!

1183
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:08,400
Oh my God.

1184
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,320
Yeah!

1185
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,980
Oh, that's the base of the diagram.

1186
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:15,880
Diorama.

1187
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,120
Not diagram, sorry.

1188
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,160
My brain is really slow today.

1189
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:22,800
Yes!

1190
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:24,140
Wait.

1191
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,740
Can we see it from the sea?

1192
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,060
No, not enough.

1193
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,320
Not enough.

1194
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:35,180
The tide must really come up here.

1195
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:35,520
I don't know.

1196
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,720
Oh my gosh!

1197
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,420
This is so... This is so nice!

1198
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:48,420
OK, let's go to the other one too.

1199
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:51,040
Let's go to the other one too.

1200
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:52,980
You.

1201
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:01,240
I'm sorry, I keep doing the easy ones because I like the... I like putting them together too, but the diagram is just...

1202
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,220
Sorry, diorama.

1203
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,020
It's just so nice.

1204
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:07,300
It's just... I like...

1205
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,560
It's so... It's so funny.

1206
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:15,930
There we go.

1207
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,140
I love diagrammas.

1208
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:26,160
Look at this.

1209
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:28,700
Beauty.

1210
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,120
Oh my gosh, and there's so many.

1211
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,060
Oh my gosh.

1212
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,360
Oh, it's so long.

1213
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,240
Is there a... Hold on.

1214
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,840
There's no like...

1215
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:51,680
I wish it had one of the cross... The train crosses, you know.

1216
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:05,850
I'm trying to find a good...

1217
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:10,670
Maybe like...

1218
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:14,290
Oh my gosh!

1219
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:14,510
Oh my gosh!

1220
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:18,390
All aboard the Phantom Train!

1221
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,110
Next stop, Akihabara Station!

1222
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,090
And then... Oh my gosh, wait.

1223
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:26,230
We can go in here?

1224
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:31,270
We can go in... And pretend we're looking out the window.

1225
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:36,800
Wait, hold on.

1226
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:37,840
We need the actual seat.

1227
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,540
Like this one.

1228
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,740
No, this view is better.

1229
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:42,560
Over here.

1230
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:46,560
Yeah!

1231
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,540
Oh, blue train seat's comfy.

1232
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:00,490
Okay.

1233
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:01,810
Okay.

1234
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:02,970
Okay.

1235
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:05,850
Now...

1236
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:07,610
It's time...

1237
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:09,950
For the layout.

1238
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:12,990
Guys...

1239
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:14,910
Which one?

1240
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:16,890
We gotta build our own railway.

1241
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,870
We got an elevated railway.

1242
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:23,890
Seaside with mount.

1243
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:25,170
Oh, that one sounds really nice.

1244
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:28,950
As someone who works at a train museum, I can confirm trains are cool.

1245
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:32,670
That's so cool!

1246
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:35,070
Number three, seaside.

1247
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:36,470
Okay, we'll go with seaside.

1248
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:38,030
Pre-created layout.

1249
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,070
I wonder how detailed we can get in here.

1250
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:43,430
What is auto?

1251
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:46,130
Oh, none of the trains go in.

1252
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:47,970
Edit!

1253
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:53,970
When editing your layout, you can freely arrange and edit railway vehicles and structures.

1254
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:55,290
Diorama parts.

1255
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:57,170
Vehicles.

1256
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:59,670
Place railway vehicles on your choice within your scene.

1257
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:04,770
Start by choosing the lead train car you wish to place then if there are any center cars.

1258
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:07,170
Oh my gosh, we can make the longest train ever.

1259
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,790
Congrats on 350k!

1260
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:11,550
Thank you!

1261
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:15,470
Last year has been so much better because you were here.

1262
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:16,350
Today is my birthday!

1263
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:20,210
Can I possibly get some birthday magic from my Kamehame... Mr. M?

1264
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:21,050
Of course!

1265
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,430
Happy Birthday!

1266
01:21:27,170 --> 01:21:28,210
Moe moe!

1267
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:29,590
Birthday!

1268
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:31,970
Magic!

1269
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:52,280
Obliterated.

1270
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:53,180
No!

1271
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:53,460
No!

1272
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,640
Happy Birthday!

1273
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,420
I'm sad I couldn't watch more of this stream due to work.

1274
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,500
No, guys!

1275
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:03,460
Have a good day with work.

1276
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,780
You can only form a train that consists of cars in the same series.

1277
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,500
Choose the structures you wish to use and place them in your scene.

1278
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,120
Environment.

1279
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,720
You can change the time of day to midday, evening or night.

1280
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:20,800
Oh my god.

1281
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,240
Wait, what kind of... People!

1282
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,960
Oh my gosh, the train otaku are out.

1283
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,880
Wait, there is so much here!

1284
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:31,800
Oh my god.

1285
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,800
I can put other vehicles too!

1286
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,560
And dogs and cats!

1287
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:51,670
Wait, wait, wait...

1288
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:57,470
Wait, wait, wait...

1289
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,960
Why does he look like he is pooping there?

1290
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:07,300
Shiba Inu lying down.

1291
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:20,910
There is a big old field of them.

1292
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:25,480
Oh no!

1293
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:26,480
Wrong one.

1294
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:28,060
What's the cats?

1295
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,200
They are so... This looks demonic a little bit.

1296
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,360
Oh!

1297
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,340
Plants, lard...

1298
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,860
Oh my goodness!

1299
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,540
Holy cow!

1300
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,600
Wait, this is perfect for a...

1301
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,520
You know?

1302
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,440
For a scene.

1303
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,520
I wish... Hold on.

1304
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,800
I'm gonna see if I can find a way to turn down here.

1305
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,040
Hold on.

1306
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,460
I'm pretty sure there is a way.

1307
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,000
Hold on.

1308
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:18,250
Sound effects.

1309
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:19,750
There we go.

1310
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:26,220
Oh, it's now too small.

1311
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:36,820
Volume large.

1312
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,420
Okay, perfect.

1313
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:41,980
We are editing.

1314
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:44,060
What's long distance?

1315
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:44,620
Oh!

1316
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,640
Congrats on 30,000 subs!

1317
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,420
Here is some more big subscriber milestone.

1318
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:57,260
Thank you, Sakura!

1319
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,680
Yes, this game is on Steam.

1320
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:01,880
This game is on Steam.

1321
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:03,000
That's where I got it.

1322
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:06,720
Someone in pre-chat was just like...

1323
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,020
Mint, how did you find this game?

1324
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,180
It has 6 reviews.

1325
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,860
Because I'm just looking up train games.

1326
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:16,660
Wow!

1327
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:16,980
Wow!

1328
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:39,070
I wanna make like a really pretty place, but I'm not good at that.

1329
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,400
Oh, wait.

1330
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,720
Circle 7?

1331
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:47,980
Wait, what's this one?

1332
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,320
Gmart.

1333
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:56,300
Wait, these are so... Oh, it kind of... I guess it's...

1334
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,140
This one has like the colors of 7-Eleven, but...

1335
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:01,300
How do I rotate it?

1336
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:02,460
Oh, here we go.

1337
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:06,960
Like that.

1338
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:10,720
But circle... Oh, no, that's circle T.

1339
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,320
Just kidding.

1340
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,400
I thought it was circle 7.

1341
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,960
Got little buildings.

1342
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,700
More buildings.

1343
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,620
Constructing buildings.

1344
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:23,220
Traditional buildings.

1345
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,440
Wow, this is so cool!

1346
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:27,900
Wow!

1347
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,460
Oh my gosh, there's so much!

1348
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,080
Hatsune Mike!

1349
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,600
Thank you so much!

1350
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:38,980
7-Eleven plus FamiMart.

1351
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,240
Yeah, yeah.

1352
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:41,580
Jevin.

1353
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:42,820
Jevin Eleven.

1354
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,780
These containers, I wanna fold them.

1355
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:54,680
Okay, so let's do our car.

1356
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:57,700
Which one should we do?

1357
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:00,740
I like the 185 series.

1358
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,780
So let's put... Oh, you?

1359
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:05,900
Down?

1360
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,210
Whoa, whoa!

1361
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:13,370
Wait, did I...

1362
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:15,910
Oh, cool!

1363
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:16,830
Okay, hold on.

1364
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,370
We'll do... We'll do the solo.

1365
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,470
We'll do like Moha solo.

1366
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:27,910
Any graveyards?

1367
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:29,010
I wish, right?

1368
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,500
Where'd it go?

1369
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:39,760
Hello?

1370
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:41,940
Oh, it's a... Oh!

1371
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,420
Do you see it going?

1372
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:55,620
Whoa, the sky turned red!

1373
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,260
Oh, this is kind of freaky.

1374
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:00,720
Oh my god, what kind of evening is this?

1375
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,600
This is the evening before everybody dies?

1376
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:06,060
This is an... This is like...

1377
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,620
Yeah, we're in terrain hell.

1378
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,280
This is the graveyard someone requested, yeah.

1379
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,180
Going through the tunnel!

1380
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:24,350
I wonder if they sound different, the trains.

1381
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,220
Evangelion moment reel.

1382
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:36,420
Oh, they're about to pass by the bugs!

1383
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:37,640
And the dogs!

1384
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:52,920
So pretty!

1385
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:02,510
This game is awesome.

1386
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:04,470
Are we able to ride the train?

1387
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:05,710
I'm trying to figure that out.

1388
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,020
Wait, I want to go to...

1389
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:19,820
I don't want to be...

1390
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,960
Oh, we can watch it like this too!

1391
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:27,860
I don't want to be the conductor though.

1392
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:30,800
I want to be like, sitting on the train and all.

1393
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,360
What's photographer?

1394
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:38,680
Oh, not a single cameraman has been assigned.

1395
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:39,300
Oh, my bad.

1396
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:39,560
Okay.

1397
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,240
Long distance.

1398
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,620
Okay, this is us just moving.

1399
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,780
And this is our photography.

1400
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,680
And then we can be inside.

1401
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,680
Nah, I want to be the Passover princess.

1402
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,900
Thank you for the super chat.

1403
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,220
Oh, wait!

1404
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:10,100
There's the bugs!

1405
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,280
And they're... Hold on, we're gonna pass all the dogs.

1406
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:16,460
There they are!

1407
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:26,000
Hold on, let's... Oh, whoops, my bad.

1408
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,360
Let's do...

1409
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,220
Maybe if we...

1410
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:34,800
Condorctor.

1411
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,460
I want to make like a really good place though.

1412
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,580
I just... Oh my gosh.

1413
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:46,100
What we can also do is, because I'm stupid with this kind of stuff, is...

1414
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:50,000
We can go to the pre-made place too.

1415
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,240
Wait, oh, wait.

1416
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:53,680
No, no, no.

1417
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:57,160
You move here.

1418
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:08,580
Jump?

1419
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,700
Oh my gosh, I'm controlling the photographer!

1420
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,180
Look at all these dogs.

1421
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:19,060
This is like a cursed site.

1422
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,460
The dog's lying in it.

1423
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:26,220
More dogs!

1424
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:30,460
I've possessed the camera lady!

1425
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:34,600
And you know what they say about cherry blossom trees, right?

1426
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,880
That there's dead bodies buried underneath... Or dead body underneath it.

1427
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,560
Look at that star, so bright.

1428
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,280
Oh, shot, shoot!

1429
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,940
I missed the shot.

1430
01:31:56,030 --> 01:31:56,630
What?

1431
01:31:56,930 --> 01:31:57,870
Yeah, that's true!

1432
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:01,290
Wait, what?

1433
01:32:01,370 --> 01:32:02,410
Yeah, that's true!

1434
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:04,870
Look it up.

1435
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:09,110
Look it up, look it up.

1436
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:10,690
This is so funny.

1437
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:13,990
Oh my goodness, this game is awesome.

1438
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:21,010
This game is so awesome!

1439
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:25,350
Streams like this make me happy, me too!

1440
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:33,970
Grab the shovel, let's find out.

1441
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:35,890
Look, the ocean.

1442
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:37,750
We can see the train.

1443
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:39,650
Oh wow, oh my gosh!

1444
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:45,210
OK,

1445
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:49,710
let's make some more stuff.

1446
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:54,550
Can the camera man go for a swim?

1447
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:57,230
You just want her to have a wet T-shirt, you perv.

1448
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:00,650
I don't know if she's wearing a white T-shirt though.

1449
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:02,510
Can she fall off the map?

1450
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:03,650
That's a better question.

1451
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:05,250
Oh, here we go!

1452
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:10,770
She made it!

1453
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:13,910
Shot!

1454
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,840
Dead bodies beneath the sakura, spawning zombie dog legions.

1455
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:25,940
Totally how it goes.

1456
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:30,340
This game is so fun!

1457
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,180
I don't know, could you even call this a game?

1458
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:32,720
It's a game.

1459
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,400
It's like a sandbox, no?

1460
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:38,620
This is good, this is good.

1461
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:50,600
Yeah, for sure.

1462
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,200
I like this thing.

1463
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,600
This is their god.

1464
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:02,820
And then this is Solid Snake.

1465
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,100
What else can we make?

1466
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,320
Gosh, there's so many things.

1467
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:13,780
Let's make some more buildings.

1468
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,960
Like this guy.

1469
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,700
Many windowed house.

1470
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:25,680
Wow, perfect for peeping in.

1471
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:31,160
Chinese stone bridge?

1472
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,020
I don't think so.

1473
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:38,160
Maritetsu cafeteria, yeah.

1474
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,780
Too many windows.

1475
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:45,700
Iguchi office.

1476
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:46,960
We'll put that over here.

1477
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,040
There's so many...

1478
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,260
Yeah, we need, I think, a building.

1479
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:56,680
A large building for...

1480
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,060
Wow!

1481
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,220
Oh my gosh!

1482
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:01,120
Oh god!

1483
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:04,060
I think there's a bit of a...

1484
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:09,180
You know, a pretty big gap between medium building and large building.

1485
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,620
Hello, baby girl.

1486
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,620
It's Pies.

1487
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,080
Come here, Pies.

1488
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:21,600
You want out?

1489
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,160
I can't let my cat out.

1490
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:52,780
My kitten.

1491
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:55,820
My little kitten.

1492
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:59,460
Let's see, where can we put the vibrant brick apartment building?

1493
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,180
It's so big.

1494
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,640
What if we put it at the top of the mountain?

1495
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,380
Wow, it works!

1496
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,120
Oh, what?

1497
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:18,280
High rise.

1498
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,380
Wow!

1499
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:24,940
A very scenic view of a giant apartment on a mountain.

1500
01:36:27,140 --> 01:36:30,200
Japan is living in 2077.

1501
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:34,660
With these architectural feats.

1502
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,980
Guys, I'm sorry if I sneeze.

1503
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:44,020
I feel one coming.

1504
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:46,920
Unlabeled gas tank.

1505
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:48,840
That does not make me feel very good.

1506
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,480
We'll put that in the ocean.

1507
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,300
This is what will spawn Godzilla.

1508
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:58,680
What is this?

1509
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,900
Oh, it's a watchtower.

1510
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:01,520
Interesting.

1511
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:04,040
Put this on top of the mountain too.

1512
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,060
Can I ride the watchtower?

1513
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:07,240
Of course.

1514
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,320
Bless you in advance.

1515
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,240
This pollen...

1516
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,020
Is making me sneeze.

1517
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:24,800
Okay, hold on.

1518
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:25,900
We're gonna go back.

1519
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,340
We're gonna go back because there is a pre-made place.

1520
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,300
And it probably looks much nicer than...

1521
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:33,420
Than what I've done.

1522
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:34,680
Look at that.

1523
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,860
It's so boring though, no?

1524
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,800
It's just a little loop.

1525
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,500
There's no...

1526
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,440
There's no depth or anything.

1527
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:52,870
We're zooming.

1528
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,140
Was that a dog?

1529
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:09,440
I hope nobody was trying to crash because...

1530
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,780
There's no like...

1531
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:14,220
No nothing to stop you.

1532
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:16,920
Those were people!

1533
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:17,020
Oh!

1534
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,180
Oh, it's a photographer!

1535
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:38,980
And a dog trying to poop in the front of the conbini.

1536
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:44,060
Another photog... Oh, I hope he got a good shot.

1537
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,940
Wait, which photographer am I?

1538
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,220
Oh, this looks so nice.

1539
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:55,700
Wait, this looks amazing!

1540
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,560
And there's a cat!

1541
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,340
Oops.

1542
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:05,600
I want it with... Wait, what did I just do?

1543
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,160
Hey, what's happening?

1544
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,140
That looks so good!

1545
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,240
You can teleport between tracks.

1546
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:25,760
I see!

1547
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,780
They physically won't let you get run over by the train.

1548
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:28,860
I see.

1549
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:35,640
They will not allow you to get run over by the train.

1550
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:36,780
They actually refuse.

1551
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:43,820
That's a good one.

1552
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,340
That's a good one!

1553
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,000
I came back to Conductor Minto, bless.

1554
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:57,140
Yeah, they're just like, no siree!

1555
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,860
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.

1556
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:04,930
Oh,

1557
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:08,590
yeah!

1558
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:10,730
I'm getting some really great shots!

1559
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:14,990
Is there any other photographers?

1560
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:16,850
Look how cute the city is!

1561
01:40:20,530 --> 01:40:21,810
Why am I huge?

1562
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:23,530
Wait, I think I'm a giant.

1563
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:28,940
Professional photographer.

1564
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,840
I want some pictures from over here too.

1565
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:32,660
Game center!

1566
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:45,960
Maybe from this side.

1567
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:47,000
Oh my gosh!

1568
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,700
The train on that side!

1569
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:50,720
Go pass it through!

1570
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:52,340
Looks so good.

1571
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:57,660
I'm a bit of a giantess.

1572
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:01,880
Is anyone into that?

1573
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:08,500
A train haiku.

1574
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:11,480
A dog tries to poop in front of the konbini.

1575
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,460
Mint Phantom likes trains.

1576
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:16,420
No comment.

1577
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:25,700
Cute!

1578
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:27,080
So cute.

1579
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,220
I love this game.

1580
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,860
I'm gonna try and build something really nice one day.

1581
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,920
I wanna build something really nice.

1582
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,060
So cozy core, right?

1583
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:48,880
Here it comes.

1584
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,300
I like the front of it.

1585
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:57,600
I like the front of the trains.

1586
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:00,200
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted!

1587
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:01,560
Thank you!

1588
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,400
I need to get to Osaka.

1589
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:07,320
Where is my train?

1590
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:12,140
Where is my train?

1591
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:20,700
It would rather me be impaled by a tree...

1592
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:24,480
Than be impaled by the train.

1593
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,760
JR is like, we will not have your blood on our hands.

1594
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:30,440
Even if it's just a video game.

1595
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:37,310
Wait, I want one from...

1596
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:42,030
No, I want one from up here.

1597
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:53,040
Because this is, you know, this is all official stuff.

1598
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:54,400
It's like an official...

1599
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,280
Will they ever come to my stop?

1600
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,320
Are they ever gonna stop for me?

1601
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:06,380
So this is like official, which is really cool, I think.

1602
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:07,640
Get one from the platform.

1603
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I want one.

1604
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:10,320
Wait, hold on.

1605
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,460
There we go, this is good.

1606
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:15,860
It's a little close, but...

1607
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:21,620
Ah!

1608
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:23,340
Happens if you jump in front of it.

1609
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:25,580
Let's try.

1610
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:35,900
Out of rice, please.

1611
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,660
We got teleported.

1612
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,020
Oh, yeah!

1613
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,440
Oh, no, no, no, I didn't mean to press back!

1614
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:51,220
Please!

1615
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:52,180
No!

1616
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,140
This town is pretty empty, though.

1617
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,400
There is just the one person.

1618
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,660
I gotta go take some allergy medicine, I think.

1619
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,200
And the dog.

1620
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:10,900
Wait, run to the playground, it might be so good.

1621
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:15,960
Photographer!

1622
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:18,680
Run to the playground.

1623
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:19,220
Oh.

1624
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:36,600
It's like I'm part-time worker town.

1625
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:39,480
Yeah.

1626
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:45,300
I have to buy tickets for my next Japan trip.

1627
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,520
But they are so expensive!

1628
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:50,000
Cats!

1629
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,620
Okay, from here might be good.

1630
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:04,030
Nice.

1631
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:07,710
I'm part-time worker!

1632
01:45:11,150 --> 01:45:11,670
Dude...

1633
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:15,370
It's like Pies and Butaro hanging out.

1634
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:19,590
What is this goofy-ass smile?

1635
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:20,170
Oh, God.

1636
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:21,690
He is the devil.

1637
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:35,690
At least this guy has like some life in his eyes.

1638
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:39,410
This guy... Oh my gosh, you can see his toe-beats!

1639
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,110
So freaky.

1640
01:45:46,690 --> 01:45:48,170
Yeah, he's got a little mustache.

1641
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:49,830
It's so cute.

1642
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:00,630
Hold on, one from on top of the slide.

1643
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:02,410
Oh, I keep pressing back.

1644
01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:02,810
No!

1645
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:06,950
Well guys, I might actually end it here.

1646
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:09,370
This is very cozy-comfy.

1647
01:46:09,970 --> 01:46:11,470
Very silly-goofy.

1648
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:14,250
Very train.

1649
01:46:15,070 --> 01:46:16,750
I learned a lot actually though.

1650
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:22,150
So thank you for everybody, all the real train otaku coming in and teaching me.

1651
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:26,430
I learned so much.

1652
01:46:26,770 --> 01:46:27,550
Very train.

1653
01:46:30,910 --> 01:46:33,170
We learned so much.

1654
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:38,390
I don't imagine I will stream this game again.

1655
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:44,730
But if I ever wanted something, maybe like a members building an actual town kind of thing would be fun.

1656
01:46:49,190 --> 01:46:50,070
Chug-a-choo!

1657
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:54,090
Not a Japan train otaku, but still enjoyed it.

1658
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:56,510
Are you an other place train otaku?

1659
01:46:57,970 --> 01:47:00,150
Because I know some people are like...

1660
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:02,170
Electric trains, not my style.

1661
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:03,910
Give me them locomotive.

1662
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:06,710
Give me those...

1663
01:47:06,710 --> 01:47:08,610
Chugging-chugging ones, you know.

1664
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:13,250
Mint-o-veal.

1665
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:16,210
From Singapore.

1666
01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:18,350
I see, I see.

1667
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:21,030
I'm not really into trains.

1668
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:23,470
But it's always fun to watch Mint-o excited about something.

1669
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:25,910
Thank you!

1670
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:29,190
Cole enjoyers here.

1671
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:33,270
Perhaps you would indeed enjoy Densha de GO!

1672
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:34,910
I do really want to play Densha de GO!

1673
01:47:37,030 --> 01:47:37,470
So...

1674
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:40,230
It has been on my list for quite a long time.

1675
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:45,750
Steam engines are romantic, electric are effective.

1676
01:47:47,290 --> 01:47:49,970
That is such a good way to put it.

1677
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:51,430
Yes!

1678
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:53,110
I understand completely!

1679
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:54,190
Yes!

1680
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:55,270
Yes!

1681
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:02,090
I think that's like the perfect way to say it.

1682
01:48:04,690 --> 01:48:07,450
Yeah, like the steam is romantic, it's aesthetic.

1683
01:48:09,010 --> 01:48:10,210
And then electric is like...

1684
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:13,130
All efficiency, baby.

1685
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:17,870
I have seen some like...

1686
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:20,050
Some...

1687
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:22,610
Train...

1688
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:24,610
Not really tours, but like...

1689
01:48:24,610 --> 01:48:26,590
I've seen some through like mountains and stuff.

1690
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:30,810
I think there was one like in California or Colorado that I watched recently.

1691
01:48:30,970 --> 01:48:32,610
That I was like, I wanna ride it!

1692
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:33,750
I wanna go.

1693
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:38,690
I visited the Kyoto Railway Museum at the end of my trip last month.

1694
01:48:38,690 --> 01:48:41,190
It was a lot of fun seeing the steam locomotives up close.

1695
01:48:42,490 --> 01:48:45,110
There was one I went to in Nagoya before.

1696
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:49,450
I can't remember the name of it, but I went to that train museum.

1697
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:54,890
Colorado has a steam train, yeah.

1698
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:01,570
I prefer electric for the daily commute for sure.

1699
01:49:02,970 --> 01:49:04,970
But anything that's like kind of like...

1700
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,410
I don't know.

1701
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:09,150
Like you said...

1702
01:49:10,030 --> 01:49:13,530
Even if they could like, you know, in the future, if they stopped...

1703
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:15,250
Like the steam...

1704
01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:17,010
Trains entirely.

1705
01:49:17,210 --> 01:49:19,950
If they could like recreate it with just like the aesthetic.

1706
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:22,450
I think that would still be nice too.

1707
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:27,210
Rocky Mountaineer is a beautiful trip.

1708
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:30,790
Have you ever ridden the metro in DC?

1709
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:31,530
I have!

1710
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:32,490
I have actually.

1711
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:40,940
Yeah, so...

1712
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:42,240
Like trains vaping.

1713
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,740
Don't say it like that!

1714
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:52,550
Don't say it like that!

1715
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:53,490
It's cursed.

1716
01:49:54,050 --> 01:49:54,950
It's too cursed.

1717
01:49:56,810 --> 01:49:57,290
Anyway,

1718
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:01,870
this was so fun!

1719
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:02,950
Thank you guys.

1720
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:05,490
I did mention it was gonna be a bit of a shorter stream.

1721
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:09,210
But if you wanna hang out some more later...

1722
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:10,770
I will be on Doki Bird's channel...

1723
01:50:11,610 --> 01:50:13,170
In a couple of hours.

1724
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:18,090
So she will be playing Visage and I will be...

1725
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:19,390
Helping her out.

1726
01:50:19,790 --> 01:50:22,150
And I think she might be...

1727
01:50:22,730 --> 01:50:22,990
Drunk?

1728
01:50:23,570 --> 01:50:24,050
Tipsy?

1729
01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:25,210
I don't know.

1730
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:25,950
I'm scared.

1731
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:32,990
Thanks for the super chill and educational stream!

1732
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:33,830
Thanks to Argo!

1733
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:35,250
Thank you!

1734
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:38,230
Former railroad employee here.

1735
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:40,990
We always call them railroad sexuals.

1736
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:42,950
Or train sexuals.

1737
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,130
Guys who take pictures of everything to rebuild it at home.

1738
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:51,850
I mean...

1739
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:54,850
But also we can just get like a nice train photo.

1740
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:56,010
It's so aesthetic, no?

1741
01:50:57,330 --> 01:50:58,210
I think.

1742
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:01,390
Same with like planes.

1743
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:04,830
I like to go to the...

1744
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:08,030
Haneda Airport Observatory and...

1745
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:10,490
Look at the planes taken off and try to get good pictures.

1746
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:12,610
There's always people there with like big old cameras.

1747
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:14,250
So fun.

1748
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:17,030
I don't know the...

1749
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:19,950
I think I prefer planes over trains.

1750
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:21,850
But in terms of photography...

1751
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:24,390
I prefer train photography over plane photography.

1752
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:27,410
Because with train photography...

1753
01:51:27,410 --> 01:51:29,210
You can, I feel...

1754
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:30,390
Get more variety.

1755
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:33,910
But with planes it's like...

1756
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:35,170
Oh, it's up in the sky again.

1757
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:39,770
But in terms of like...

1758
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:40,670
Tech and...

1759
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:44,830
Interest, I think planes take over trains for me.

1760
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:46,250
Sorry, every train otaku here.

1761
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:50,370
It's also hard to get close to planes.

1762
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:57,250
What if a train was up in the sky?

1763
01:51:59,430 --> 01:52:02,170
I think we'd have some...

1764
01:52:02,170 --> 01:52:03,790
Some big problems.

1765
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:09,490
Actually, this is so funny.

1766
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:11,470
Well, I wonder if I could say this.

1767
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:17,430
The last time I met Kiara in Japan...

1768
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:20,110
She wanted to do a little bit of a photo shoot.

1769
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:21,910
And so I have like...

1770
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:24,530
A ton of photos of her at a train station.

1771
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:26,230
And I'm like...

1772
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:27,230
First of all, it's Kiara.

1773
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:29,590
She's so stinking cute.

1774
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:32,570
And then it's Kiara at the train station.

1775
01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:34,330
So I'm just like...

1776
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:41,030
It's like my treasures, my treasures.

1777
01:52:46,930 --> 01:52:47,990
She's so cute.

1778
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:49,650
That's all in my phone.

1779
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:53,730
They look like stalker shots a little bit.

1780
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:54,370
But that's okay.

1781
01:52:55,610 --> 01:52:57,210
Printed all over your wall like Bocchi.

1782
01:52:57,210 --> 01:52:58,350
So true.

1783
01:52:58,990 --> 01:53:00,270
I could just stare up at the ceiling.

1784
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:09,480
Anyway...

1785
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:10,980
Thank you guys for today.

1786
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:13,300
We shall do more train things in the future.

1787
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,720
I want to become train educated.

1788
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:22,280
I will wear this hat with pride.

1789
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,080
And it will be...

1790
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,060
It will be...

1791
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:29,080
Something I earned.

1792
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:36,880
And also...

1793
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:46,960
Thank you!

1794
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:54,290
Otsumito!

1795
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:55,850
Thanks for watching!

1796
01:53:56,010 --> 01:53:57,050
Thanks for hanging out!

1797
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:02,710
Remember that maritime vessel?

1798
01:54:03,030 --> 01:54:04,050
Get out of here!

1799
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:04,830
Get out of here!

1800
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:07,770
Better than both planes and trains?

1801
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:09,030
Get out of here!

1802
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:10,910
Flying train.

1803
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:13,190
Astro train from Transformers.

1804
01:54:15,910 --> 01:54:16,470
Otsumito!

1805
01:54:17,010 --> 01:54:18,030
Thank you guys!

1806
01:54:18,270 --> 01:54:19,710
Train collab with the train operator.

1807
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:22,410
That would be fun!

1808
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:27,210
Bye bye!

1809
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:28,330
Otsumito!

1810
01:54:28,490 --> 01:54:28,730
Otsumito!

1811
01:54:29,190 --> 01:54:29,730
Bye bye!

1812
01:54:29,790 --> 01:54:30,050
Bye bye!

1813
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:30,510
Thank you!

1814
01:54:31,050 --> 01:54:32,030
Bye bye!
