1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
See you, Weasel.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:01,940
See you never.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,280
Five minutes.

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,220
I know!

5
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,500
The colonel and the rest are alright.

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,520
Good.

7
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,340
Let's go.

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,100
Sorry I had to speed through the ending like that.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,720
My goodness.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,760
Oh, Weasel.

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,120
Ah!

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,240
Weasel.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,260
I had nothing around me that I could believe in.

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,540
Not my parents, not anyone else.

15
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,220
That's why I joined the army.

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,520
It gave me a sense of right and wrong.

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,120
Lambda!

18
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:33,940
Thank you!

19
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,480
Of justice and purpose.

20
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,800
But that wasn't the right way.

21
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,720
Beliefs can't be borrowed.

22
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,800
They have to be looked for and thought about by yourself.

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,420
I have to face myself and start searching.

24
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,960
And I will find it.

25
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,340
That's good.

26
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,420
But if possible, maybe I could make that search with you at my side?

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,040
Yeah, I'd like that too.

28
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,560
Oh!

29
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,740
Really?

30
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:00,880
Really.

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,160
I came to Outer Heaven to settle a score with the past.

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,480
That was what I thought.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,360
But that wasn't the truth.

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,880
I realized that when I met you, what I really wanted was death.

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,280
Wait.

36
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,360
When I met you, I just wanted to die.

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,760
What I wanted after everything, had been decided was for someone to take my life.

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,340
I must have been afraid.

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,380
Of seeing what was left standing.

40
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,460
Of myself as I really was.

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,100
Is that how you still feel?

42
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,040
No.

43
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,140
I think I want to live.

44
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,100
Accept myself.

45
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,760
Accept myself.

46
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,820
Forgive myself.

47
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,200
Life is worth living.

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,460
Even if it hurts you.

49
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,700
Even if you hurt in it.

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,420
You taught me that.

51
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,740
You were my salvation.

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,260
Wow.

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,060
Snake.

54
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,180
That's why I've decided to go back.

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,060
Back?

56
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,020
To the States?

57
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,100
He was in Alaska.

58
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,220
He was still in the States.

59
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,060
Uh-huh.

60
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,220
Don't.

61
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,160
There's no way they'll let you go.

62
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,020
They'll be waiting for you.

63
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,580
And it's probably Foxhound.

64
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,900
I know that.

65
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,440
But I have to go back.

66
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,180
Why?

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,120
To understand.

68
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,740
Why we had to fight this fight.

69
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,840
What it was that I did.

70
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,060
And who Solid Snake was.

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm going to confront the faceless men who Play chess with people's lives and hearts in the shadows.

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,100
So that I can understand.

73
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,720
And they will confess.

74
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,080
Every conspiracy they move.

75
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,960
Every victim left on the trail of their private gain.

76
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,900
Everything.

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,740
It's the only thing I can do.

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,560
For the casualties of theirs.

79
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,880
And my dirty war.

80
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,240
Snake.

81
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,100
Unless I do that, there will be no forgiveness.

82
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,140
And nothing to find for me.

83
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,640
Is that the end?

84
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,220
Don't worry.

85
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,100
I'm going back so that I can live.

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,860
When I've made them pay, I'll be back.

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,060
Will you wait for me?

88
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,600
You can count on it.

89
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,660
And...

90
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,080
That's Ghost Babble!

91
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,930
Thank you!

92
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,070
For the Akasupa.

93
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,650
Metal Gear Ghost Babble.

94
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,150
Hell yeah!

95
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,650
You can check out Bakutai in Zone of the Enders.

96
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,190
Yeah, I do want to play Zone of the Enders real bad.

97
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,110
Thank you guys.

98
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,150
I'm not going to let the VOD disappear.

99
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,210
So I'm just going to give a quick goodbye.

100
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,590
As we drive into the sunset.

101
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,050
Thank you!

102
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,750
I have not heard that Luka song.

103
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,230
I'll look it up.

104
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,870
Thank you!

105
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,090
Otsumito everybody!

106
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,530
Oh gosh, that took way, way longer than I expected it to.

107
00:03:59,090 --> 00:03:59,830
But that's OK.

108
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,470
I still had a lot of fun.

109
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,850
And I hope you guys did as well.

110
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,070
Otsumito everyone, have a good night.

111
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,870
Have a good day.

112
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,610
And I'll see you guys when I see you next.

113
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,650
Bye bye!
