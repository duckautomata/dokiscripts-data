1
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,370
Oh my god!

2
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,410
You guys can't hear it!

3
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,210
Wait!

4
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:40,810
Wait!

5
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,610
Everything's messed up.

6
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,750
Hold on.

7
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,950
You guys can't hear it.

8
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,550
No.

9
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,250
Wait a second.

10
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,710
Wait a second.

11
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,350
One second.

12
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,610
Which one is it?

13
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,070
Oh no!

14
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,270
I'm gonna guess.

15
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,270
Oh, I found it.

16
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,390
I have to restart?

17
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:08,950
Restart now.

18
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,630
No!

19
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,430
Hold on.

20
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,410
Redo.

21
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,450
Redo.

22
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,440
Oh, it's loud.

23
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,920
Oh, it's loud in my ear.

24
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,540
Wait, I don't know the words.

25
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,940
Oh, it hasn't started yet.

26
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,400
How is the audio?

27
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,000
Why is all my stuff frozen?

28
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,020
Something strange?

29
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,020
Sleeping in your bed.

30
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,280
Who are you gonna call?

31
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,740
Ah!

32
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,240
Uh, nobody.

33
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,580
Uh, who are you gonna call?

34
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,380
I don't know the words!

35
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,340
I don't know the words!

36
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,760
The, the, the words!

37
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,580
Hold on!

38
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,340
Uh, I'm afraid of no ghost.

39
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,260
Oh, I got him.

40
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,520
I got him.

41
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:38,760
I got him.

42
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,960
I'm afraid of no ghost.

43
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,640
Ever seeing things.

44
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,820
Running through your head.

45
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,000
Who can you call?

46
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,660
Ghostbusters!

47
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,060
An invisible man?

48
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,180
Sleeping in your bed.

49
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,160
Ow!

50
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,540
Who are you gonna call?

51
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,260
Ghostbusters!

52
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,330
I'm afraid of no ghost.

53
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,730
I'm afraid of no ghost.

54
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,630
Oh, I keep hitting my ceiling fan.

55
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,770
Who are you gonna call?

56
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,470
If you're all alone.

57
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,670
Pick up the phone.

58
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,110
And call!

59
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,050
Ghostbusters!

60
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,730
Da, da, da!

61
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,350
Freaky Ghost Maid!

62
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,250
Ouch!

63
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,090
Freaky Ghost Man!

64
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,230
Freaky Man Baby!

65
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,770
Who are you gonna call?

66
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,290
Ghostbusters!

67
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,630
Maybe have a dose?

68
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,560
Freaky Ghost...

69
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:11,960
Ghostbusters!

70
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,480
Who is that?

71
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,740
Ghostbusters!

72
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,240
Uh,

73
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,690
my chat is frozen in now.

74
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,450
Oh gosh, let me tell you something.

75
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,670
Ghostbuster makes me feel good!

76
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,820
I'm afraid of no ghost.

77
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm afraid of no ghost.

78
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,100
No, no.

79
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,020
No, no.

80
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,460
Ghostbusters!

81
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,680
When it comes to your door.

82
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,980
Unless you want some more.

83
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,040
I think you better cough, cause I just feel good.

84
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
Ghostbusters.

85
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,380
Who you gonna call?

86
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,020
Ghostbusters.

87
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,520
Who you gonna call?

88
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,160
Ghostbusters.

89
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,620
I think you better call.

90
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,400
Ghostbusters.

91
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,360
I'm gonna fix the chat in like two seconds.

92
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,360
I can't see you guys.

93
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,060
Who you gonna call?

94
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,860
Ghostbusters.

95
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,880
Louder.

96
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,920
Ghostbusters.

97
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,380
Who you gonna call?

98
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,020
Ghostbusters.

99
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,860
Uh, he likes the girls too.

100
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,780
What the hell are these lyrics?

101
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,290
Who you gonna call?

102
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,590
Ghostbusters.

103
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,090
Who you gonna call?

104
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,040
Ghostbusters.

105
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,870
Who you gonna call?

106
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,550
Ghostbusters.

107
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,550
Who you gonna call?

108
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,390
Ghostbusters.

109
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,730
Finally, it's over.

110
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,210
Hold on, I'm fixing chat now.

111
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,570
Oh, you guys are so tiny.

112
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,630
There we go.

113
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,250
A never-ending song, for real.

114
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,130
Okay, hold on.

115
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,870
I think you guys like that.

116
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,290
And, uh, keep visible.

117
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,770
Perfect.

118
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:26,990
Hello!

119
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,430
Hello!

120
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,590
I'm gonna close out of this for a second.

121
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,150
Hello!

122
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,010
Hi.

123
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,150
Hey.

124
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,330
Hi.

125
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:38,670
Hi.

126
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,390
Hello.

127
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,450
Hi, Minto.

128
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,750
Hi!

129
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,470
Oh, I still have a reverb on.

130
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,770
Hold on.

131
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,470
I don't have it anymore.

132
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,270
Hi, boss.

133
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,510
Hi!

134
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,030
Hold on.

135
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,630
Cool.

136
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,710
Yay!

137
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,570
Hello!

138
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,430
Your third dimension is showing.

139
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,370
Don't look.

140
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,350
Oh my gosh.

141
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,650
Oh, thank you!

142
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,110
Wait.

143
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,650
Can I see donos?

144
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,970
I don't know if you... Can you guys hear them?

145
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,370
I don't know.

146
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,250
Is this me or is...

147
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,290
Using the inside of Mint's sleeve, consider... flashing.

148
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,270
What?

149
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,430
A big yaoi hand?

150
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,430
Ma'am, don't grab me like that.

151
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,730
And here it goes.

152
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,710
Thanks for the five gifted!

153
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,790
It's five.

154
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,210
Sorry.

155
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,770
Sorry, I can't...

156
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,070
The twenty gifted!

157
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,850
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,410
Thank you for the twenty gifted.

159
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,510
I owe you a one.

160
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,110
Owe!

161
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,270
Ha ha.

162
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,590
Woo!

163
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,110
Yikes.

164
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:58,750
Yikes.

165
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,070
What?

166
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,450
Did I change it to low latency?

167
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,210
Let me double check.

168
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,230
Not that I could fix it now.

169
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,470
I can't fix it now, you guys.

170
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,710
Anyway, welcome... Oh, I didn't.

171
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,350
Okay, it's fine.

172
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,990
Sorry, some of the messages seem a little delayed, but it might just be you.

173
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,090
You.

174
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,670
This might be your fault.

175
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,670
Oh, she can't count.

176
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,510
She broke her neck on stream.

177
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,310
Yeah, I can really do that.

178
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:23,650
Hold on.

179
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,130
You wanna see me break my neck?

180
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:42,980
Uh oh.

181
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,060
Hold on.

182
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,220
I think I gotta adjust something.

183
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,900
There we go.

184
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,080
So talented!

185
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,720
For some reason my feet are always in the floor.

186
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,920
Unless I try to touch my toes.

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,860
And then I just go sink back into the floor.

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
It's just a ghost thing.

189
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,600
I don't know where floors are.

190
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,500
Or what they are.

191
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,880
Here, let's go around my haunted abandoned abode.

192
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,820
Let's uh...

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
Let's go together.

194
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,840
I haven't actually explored this place.

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,340
So here, I'll go like here.

196
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,500
And you guys follow.

197
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,140
Wait a second.

198
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,480
Why is there a second window here?

199
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,440
Go away?

200
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:26,900
Okay.

201
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,020
Does anyone really know?

202
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,400
No.

203
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,820
Here we go.

204
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,000
This is where I was hiding.

205
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,380
Oh, there's another room over there.

206
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,720
Okay, freaky.

207
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,500
Let's go this way.

208
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,660
This is where I was hiding.

209
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,020
Right here.

210
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,360
Nice and comfy.

211
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,960
Yeah.

212
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,600
Looks like something will pop out at any second now.

213
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,780
Is this your house?

214
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,100
No!

215
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,000
This is my grandma's house.

216
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,280
There's some bad words on the ceiling.

217
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,480
Do not read.

218
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,780
Do not interact.

219
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,500
I like that guy though.

220
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,800
That one right there.

221
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,940
That one's pretty fun.

222
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,360
Your grandma lives like this?

223
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,780
Yep.

224
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,380
And we got some more stuff over here.

225
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,940
Wow.

226
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,780
Wow.

227
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:25,940
Wow.

228
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:26,900
Wow.

229
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,180
Wow.

230
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,700
Wow.

231
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,540
Let's go over here.

232
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,260
I actually have some fun.

233
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,400
This one looks like the dog from...

234
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:33,560
Wait.

235
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,180
Can you see it?

236
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,440
This one.

237
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,900
It looks like the dog from Adventure Time, does it not?

238
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,080
Jake.

239
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,580
Sasuga, the legendary grandma.

240
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,700
Yeah.

241
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,160
Jake.

242
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,560
Jake.

243
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,860
Jake.

244
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,420
We have another room.

245
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,040
Whoa.

246
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,360
Jam.

247
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,200
That's what we were doing.

248
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,080
We were...

249
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,800
Clearly, we should have been in this room and say...

250
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,680
Oh.

251
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,340
Oh.

252
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:57,500
Oh.

253
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,680
Oh.

254
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,080
Oh.

255
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,440
Oh.

256
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,460
Behind you.

257
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,400
Wait.

258
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,000
You guys guess...

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,540
Hold on.

260
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,440
Let me grab this.

261
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,840
Take a guess what is...

262
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,540
Take a guess what is behind you right now.

263
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,880
Take a guess.

264
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,500
Not behind me.

265
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,040
Don't look...

266
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,640
Don't look at that.

267
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,960
Behind you.

268
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,860
You.

269
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,620
You right now.

270
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,040
Me?

271
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,360
No.

272
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,800
I'm right here.

273
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,120
That'd be stupid.

274
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,740
Guess.

275
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,320
Guess.

276
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,820
Guess.

277
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,040
Guess.

278
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm not seeing any...

279
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,140
I'm not seeing any...

280
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,160
I'm not seeing any...

281
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,180
I'm not seeing any...

282
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,660
I'm not seeing any...

283
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,660
Correct answers.

284
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,000
That's fine.

285
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,820
That's fine.

286
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,180
In fact, I probably wouldn't have even been able to tell who it was if it wasn't for the hat.

287
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,600
Now, let me...

288
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Back up.

289
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,700
Let me show you.

290
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,200
Oh my god.

291
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,460
It's a Polari the...

292
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,140
Polari.

293
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,380
Not Polari.

294
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,280
It's a...

295
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,580
Polari the Blatter Boys.

296
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,420
Oh my god.

297
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,360
Oh my god.

298
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,420
Oh my god.

299
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,600
I didn't recognize you without your hat on, Polari the Blatter...

300
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,380
I give up.

301
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,280
Okay, let's keep going.

302
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,320
Let's keep going.

303
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,260
Let's keep going.

304
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,400
I did it twice.

305
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,600
Any other special cameos we can find?

306
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm going to try walking into this wall.

307
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,080
Wait.

308
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,320
There's more yonder.

309
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,240
Okay.

310
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,860
There's more yonder.

311
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,640
How do we get over there?

312
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,400
Here.

313
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,700
Hold on.

314
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
I'm going to try and back you up.

315
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,340
Can you see?

316
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,900
No.

317
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,260
Okay.

318
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,180
Over yonder.

319
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,040
How do I...

320
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,940
Hold on.

321
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,740
Back it up, Minto.

322
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,380
I don't think we're going to be able to go over there.

323
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,740
How do we get there?

324
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Thank you.

325
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:02,740
Thank you.

326
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,460
Thank you.

327
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,520
Thank you.

328
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:03,740
Thank you.

329
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:03,840
Two.

330
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,440
Two.

331
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,120
Thank you.

332
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,720
What's it say?

333
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,860
Is this what the maid cafe looks like behind the camera?

334
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,740
You know, actually, it's pretty funny.

335
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,720
What you see on my stream is actually just like a big old cardboard cutout.

336
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,440
What the?

337
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,720
There we go.

338
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,000
Let's go this way.

339
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,760
If we can't get over there, I guess that's it for us.

340
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,480
Yonder.

341
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,740
Yonder.

342
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,100
I want...

343
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,780
I wish to explore yonder.

344
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,520
This has to be the door.

345
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,220
I see right there.

346
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,200
You guys...

347
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,520
You guys can't see.

348
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,100
Hold on.

349
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,260
Let me see if I can grab you.

350
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,400
Hold on.

351
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,160
All right.

352
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,160
I'm going to try and grab you.

353
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,760
Oh, sorry.

354
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,520
You just see my hand.

355
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:52,880
There you go.

356
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,200
All right.

357
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,800
See?

358
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,500
Yonder.

359
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,680
We must go beyond.

360
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,780
How do we get over there?

361
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,740
How do we get over there?

362
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,300
To yonder.

363
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,580
Look over there.

364
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,440
That's the entrance.

365
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,500
That's where I came in actually because I remember the little text on the wall.

366
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,700
But we can't go through.

367
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,540
We can't go through.

368
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,180
Sad.

369
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,360
Oh well.

370
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,780
Oh well.

371
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,700
We tried.

372
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,300
There was an attempt.

373
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,640
There was an attempt.

374
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,980
I have a bunch of other worlds.

375
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,740
Oh.

376
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,760
I would like to take you guys to... pretty much all of them.

377
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,580
I haven't explored before.

378
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,480
I wanted to explore them with you guys.

379
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,080
And at each one, we'll do like a karaoke or something.

380
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,120
And we'll have some... some fun.

381
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,700
So this is what it's like when we forget to take our meds.

382
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,360
Forget your meds.

383
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,860
Don't take them.

384
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,860
Don't take your meds.

385
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,760
Forget them.

386
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,500
Don't do that.

387
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,660
Actually, don't do that.

388
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,720
Take your meds, okay?

389
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,640
Let's see.

390
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,860
I found a bunch and I put them all in my favorite... in my favorite place.

391
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,200
Like my favorites for VR chat.

392
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:21,460
Such as... Titanic Survival Experience.

393
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,860
Let's go to that one!

394
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,060
All you

395
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,380
see is black.

396
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,260
Oh, this is a hefty boy.

397
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,540
Okay.

398
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,840
We have to survive the Titanic, everybody.

399
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,640
Alright.

400
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,420
Are you guys ready?

401
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,600
And obviously, we know what song we need to sing here.

402
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,700
Clearly.

403
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,960
Don't let go...

404
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,400
Where are you guys?

405
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,940
Where are you guys?

406
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,700
Where are you guys?

407
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,000
Guys?

408
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,320
Oh!

409
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,260
There you are.

410
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,840
Welcome to the Titanic.

411
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,840
Every night in my...

412
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,140
Can't grab you.

413
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,280
There we go.

414
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:19,940
Sorry.

415
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm throwing you around.

416
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,040
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

417
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,520
Every night in my dreams...

418
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,100
What is this?

419
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,900
Oh, is this a game?

420
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,140
Wait a second.

421
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,700
This is not just a regular place.

422
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,300
This is like a game game.

423
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,560
There is currently a round playing right now.

424
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,760
Wait, what do you mean by that?

425
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,740
I'm the only person here.

426
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,180
What do you mean by that?

427
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,700
There's a... up there it says...

428
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,280
There is currently a round playing right now.

429
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,040
If you wish to experience this from the beginning to end, please wait until this text says...

430
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,920
The Titanic is not sinking.

431
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,720
No way.

432
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,700
Guys, we have to wait until the text says the Titanic is not sinking.

433
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,180
Approximately 30 minutes!

434
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,480
Who else is here?

435
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,360
But it's just me.

436
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,180
The room is haunted.

437
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,850
Are you interested in role play events?

438
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,230
We're role playing the Titanic!

439
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,370
No.

440
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,890
Things to remember, keep in mind.

441
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,920
Stay seated in the lifeboat.

442
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,980
Photos of the Titanic below the ocean.

443
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,960
Wait, wait, this is kind of cool.

444
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,460
Look, look, look.

445
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,280
Woah.

446
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,600
Wow.

447
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,240
Near... far...

448
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,700
It's split in two?

449
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,020
Wait, what do you mean?

450
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,500
What do you mean?

451
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,740
How do you know?

452
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,140
How do you know?

453
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,440
How do you know it's split in two?

454
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,110
We can spectate.

455
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,170
Actually, let's go spectate and see what we can see.

456
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,890
If someone is doing this.

457
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,810
Alright guys, hold on.

458
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,730
I'm gonna put you right...

459
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:09,550
Sorry.

460
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,650
I have to get used to VRChat once again.

461
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,650
We're gonna go spectate.

462
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,430
We're gonna go spectate.

463
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,020
Oh!

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,900
Oh my god!

465
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,380
Oh my god!

466
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,140
Do you see it down there?

467
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,460
Do you?

468
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,700
Oh my god!

469
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,340
How am I supposed to spectate?

470
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,580
They're so far away.

471
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,660
I can't see anything.

472
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,920
Oh my god.

473
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,020
Wait, it's not even... There's some boats down there.

474
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,280
You can barely see them though.

475
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,760
It's really dark.

476
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,320
It was night vision.

477
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,640
I can't get any closer I think.

478
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,140
This spectator mode is like outer space.

479
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,180
This is what the aliens saw when the Titanic was going down apparently.

480
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,240
Is it even sinking?

481
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,240
I don't know.

482
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,940
I think it's slowly turning sideways.

483
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,900
Maybe.

484
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,380
We're in creative mode right now.

485
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,780
We have just a black screen?

486
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,680
No, you don't.

487
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,440
Really?

488
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,400
Is it that dark?

489
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,120
Oh, it's like really dark.

490
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,540
Yeah, yeah.

491
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,660
It's really, really dark.

492
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,760
Yeah, it's slowly tilting.

493
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,860
It's slowly tilting.

494
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,940
Oh my gosh, this is kind of horrible.

495
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,780
This is what they saw during the Titanic for real.

496
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,860
It was actually like this pitch black, you know?

497
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,500
It was actually like this dark.

498
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,760
This is crazy.

499
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,300
Yeah, you can see the lights of the ship.

500
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,600
Oh my gosh, get out of there!

501
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,540
Get out of there!

502
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,180
Swim!

503
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,960
Actually, don't swim.

504
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,240
Oh my gosh, I'm going to pretend to be that one guy from the Titanic movie.

505
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,980
Who gets out because he says, I have a child.

506
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,540
That's what I'm going to do.

507
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,940
I'm going to steal a baby and then claim to have a child.

508
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,160
Relive the horror.

509
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,120
Oh my gosh, it's really starting to sink though.

510
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,080
It's really on its side.

511
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,580
Good thing we didn't do this.

512
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,800
You know what?

513
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,860
It's probably better that we stayed here and let all those guys do that, you know?

514
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,160
It's probably better that we're here and not over there.

515
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,320
Just saying.

516
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,980
All I see is Minto hair.

517
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,700
You can barely see the boat.

518
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,960
Oh my gosh, it's really starting to get sideways.

519
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,840
I see it actually moving, moving now.

520
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,200
Wow.

521
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,140
Can we get any closer?

522
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm trying to, but I don't seem to be able to.

523
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,880
I thought like spectate meant like go onto the ship and as like a ghost mode, you know?

524
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,780
Oh.

525
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,420
Oh wait, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

526
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,620
I feel like, can I even sing this here?

527
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,300
Titanic, Jack and Rose, Metal Gear.

528
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,340
The lights turned off, the lights turned off.

529
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,740
The lights turned off, the lights turned off.

530
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,620
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, it's going down.

531
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,100
I don't know if you'll be able to see it, but...

532
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,180
There's like little boats down there, you see them?

533
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,260
They're really hard to see.

534
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,340
There's little boats down there.

535
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,220
They're escaping.

536
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:22,880
Escaping.

537
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,960
Oh my gosh, it's so sideways.

538
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,440
Titanic!

539
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,840
Oh my god.

540
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,880
Oh my god.

541
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,960
I don't know what the boats are doing though.

542
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't know.

543
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,620
Or the rescue boats, if there's anybody on them.

544
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,000
Who was, who was here?

545
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,940
The brightness is through the roof.

546
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,260
Okay.

547
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,000
How do I, how do I get back to the main room?

548
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,060
I'm gonna, okay.

549
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,440
If you guys have a, like if you guys turned your brightness up, prepare your eyes.

550
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,280
We're about to go back into the lit room, okay?

551
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,000
We're about to go back into the lit room.

552
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,540
Three, two, one.

553
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,840
Woo!

554
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,920
You guys are there!

555
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,760
Oh my gosh, wait.

556
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,640
Oh my gosh.

557
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,920
Wait, you guys come back to me.

558
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,880
Okay, there we go.

559
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,830
They are at, let's see.

560
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,650
Second class staircase is flooded.

561
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,010
We can go on the stern maybe.

562
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,750
We can maybe go on the stern.

563
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,410
Let's see.

564
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:36,410
Oh!

565
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,850
Oh my god, we're on the ship!

566
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,090
Oh, guys.

567
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,070
Guys, I'm sorry.

568
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,860
Guys, I didn't make it!

569
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,980
You guys, I can't move.

570
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,280
You guys, I'm stuck.

571
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,420
I'm stuck.

572
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,180
You guys!

573
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,340
I can't respond.

574
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,020
Oh, I'm sinking more into the water.

575
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,380
Oh my god, I'm sinking into the water.

576
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:16,760
Guys!

577
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,860
Can you see me?

578
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,320
Wait, can you see me?

579
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,400
I can't see anything.

580
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,860
It's too dark.

581
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,800
Oh my god, guys, come back to me, come back to me.

582
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,520
Come back to me.

583
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,470
I can't see anything.

584
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,110
I'm falling!

585
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,570
Guys, help me!

586
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,770
You're way up there.

587
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,930
I'm so, I'm down in the...

588
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:50,500
Please, guys.

589
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,500
Okay, hold on.

590
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,180
Okay.

591
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,860
Hold on.

592
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,920
Could you see me?

593
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Can you see me?

594
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,880
Can you?

595
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

596
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,420
Wait, wait, guys.

597
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Can you see me?

598
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,260
I can't see you, guys.

599
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,900
I can't see anything.

600
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,520
You guys.

601
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,700
You guys, I think we didn't make it.

602
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,580
We're stuck in the darkness.

603
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,240
I can sometimes see...

604
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh!

605
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,520
Oh!

606
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,540
We're going up.

607
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,140
Somehow.

608
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:19,660
Hold on.

609
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,680
I'm gonna show you guys.

610
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,580
I'm gonna show you guys.

611
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:21,800
Look.

612
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,560
There's the ship!

613
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,800
Oh, wait.

614
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,020
No.

615
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,540
Never mind.

616
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,740
Can it work, please?

617
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,180
The ship?

618
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,320
Oh, I think we missed it.

619
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
The ship is down there.

620
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,880
And we're currently dying in the water.

621
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,720
I think we didn't make it.

622
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,960
So, I think we're gonna respawn.

623
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,700
It won't let me.

624
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,220
You guys were trapped in... Oh!

625
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,120
Oh, my God.

626
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,160
The Titanic has fully sank.

627
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,650
Well, that was something, wasn't it?

628
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,070
Hold on.

629
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:37,690
I gotta readjust in my room for a second.

630
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,550
I got a little overwhelmed.

631
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,710
You're okay?

632
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,950
Okay, there we go.

633
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,170
We're okay!

634
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,430
We're okay.

635
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,470
Let's... You know what?

636
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,290
After experiencing that, I don't feel so good singing My Heart Will Go On.

637
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,830
There were two other sister ships.

638
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,470
The Olympic and the Britannic.

639
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,830
Only one of them survived!

640
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,290
Let's restart.

641
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,530
No way.

642
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,050
You guys, I don't think we'll live.

643
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,940
Let's go to another world.

644
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,840
Let's go to this one.

645
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,640
This one will make us feel so good.

646
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,560
Okay, guys?

647
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,400
Okay.

648
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:22,940
Here we go!

649
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,640
That was really fast.

650
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,340
Now, this could either be super great or super terrible.

651
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,140
So, we'll see.

652
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,160
We'll see.

653
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,000
Excuse you.

654
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,600
Oh.

655
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,820
Hello?

656
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,680
Oh.

657
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,140
Whoa.

658
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,900
You guys are probably like, what's going on?

659
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:49,820
Hello.

660
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,800
Welcome to another world.

661
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,760
It seems like this one is a game, as you can see.

662
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,840
Touch and play.

663
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,020
But what are we playing?

664
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,220
That's a great question.

665
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,660
I love cubes.

666
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,420
Are we playing Snake?

667
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,240
No, no, no.

668
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,100
No, no, no.

669
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,000
No, no, no.

670
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,800
We're playing...

671
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,660
Worms.

672
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,100
Welcome to Slither.io!

673
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,740
Wait.

674
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,700
I can't let go of the camera.

675
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,640
Let go of the camera.

676
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
Welcome to...

677
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,410
Why is this so hard?

678
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:36,910
Slither.io!

679
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,350
Welcome!

680
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,530
Welcome!

681
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,370
Welcome!

682
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,390
Welcome to Slither.io!

683
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,370
Welcome to Slither.io!

684
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,530
We're playing Worms!

685
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,390
We're playing Worm City!

686
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:48,990
Okay.

687
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,730
Are you guys ready?

688
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,590
Hold on.

689
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,750
I gotta figure out how to make this so I don't touch it.

690
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,190
Sorry.

691
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,110
It's my chat window.

692
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,170
I keep moving it on accident and I don't want to.

693
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,910
Lock.

694
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,890
How do I lock you?

695
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:05,790
How do I lock you?

696
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,210
Maybe.

697
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:07,790
Let me try this.

698
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,910
Edit mode.

699
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:13,450
Oh.

700
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,910
There we go.

701
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:14,370
There we go.

702
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:14,630
There we go.

703
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,010
Okay.

704
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:15,670
We're good.

705
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,170
All right.

706
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,050
Okay.

707
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,370
Okay.

708
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,780
Thank you!

709
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,560
She became a worm for us.

710
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,100
She loves us.

711
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,740
All right.

712
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,360
Let's do...

713
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,240
Wait.

714
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,820
I'm gonna turn around.

715
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,320
And press jump to go faster.

716
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,940
We're gonna play.

717
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,560
Okay, guys?

718
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,340
All right.

719
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,520
Aim your mouse.

720
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,840
Oh.

721
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,280
Aim your mouse.

722
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,300
Right hand.

723
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,580
The snakes will follow it.

724
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,700
Push the button that you use.

725
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,340
Whoever has the longest snake is the most superior player.

726
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,780
All?

727
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,780
Touch to play.

728
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,440
Oh, God!

729
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,200
Oh, my God!

730
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:07,640
I'm...

731
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,060
Oh, my God!

732
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,380
I'm using my hand to control him.

733
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,040
You guys...

734
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,060
You guys...

735
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,520
This is so awesome!

736
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,620
I'm gonna be the biggest worm.

737
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,960
I'm gonna be the biggest worm.

738
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,060
Oh, my gosh.

739
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,140
This is kind of awesome.

740
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,840
This is kind of great.

741
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,720
This is kind of fantastic.

742
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,320
Oh, it says jump to go faster.

743
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,520
Oh, there we go.

744
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,060
There we go.

745
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,560
Oh, but I lose all my things.

746
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,480
Okay.

747
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,360
All right.

748
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,440
Don't jump to go faster.

749
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,100
Snake looks so...

750
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,920
He's doing his best.

751
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,320
Yay.

752
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,600
Guys, this is the optimal... most optimized way to watch Slither.io.

753
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,600
I'm just gonna say...

754
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,740
I'm just gonna say I think we did it.

755
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,840
I think we've done the greatest thing of VTuber... I think we've peaked.

756
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,220
We've peaked.

757
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,160
I'm just saying.

758
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,940
I could... I think I'll... I will be back here.

759
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,660
What should we sing while we play Slither.io?

760
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,460
What should we sing?

761
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,120
What should we sing?

762
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,980
What's some songs?

763
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,920
Snake Eater?

764
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,460
No, no, no.

765
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,220
I have that for later.

766
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,400
My heart will go on.

767
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,440
Okay.

768
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,280
I have to like twist my hand.

769
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,400
Wait, can I pause this?

770
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,520
Pause the game.

771
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,660
How do I win the game?

772
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,880
How do I stop the game?

773
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,140
Oh.

774
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,420
There.

775
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,300
There we go.

776
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,280
Are we okay?

777
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,740
Are we okay?

778
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,580
Are we okay?

779
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,020
Are we okay?

780
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,100
Are we okay?

781
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,280
I don't even know where you guys are.

782
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,660
Are we okay?

783
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,860
Are we okay?

784
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,500
There we go.

785
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,960
Are you?

786
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,580
Are you?

787
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,840
Alright, let's do free fall.

788
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,640
It's shut up.

789
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,540
Are you okay?

790
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:40,840
Yeah.

791
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,500
I'm fine, actually.

792
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,320
Let's see.

793
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,460
What song shall we sing?

794
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,860
Heart will go on.

795
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,220
And then we'll play.

796
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,440
Give me a second.

797
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,740
Let me set it up.

798
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,360
My heart will go on.

799
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,420
Don't mind my body, please.

800
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,460
Don't mind my body when I do that.

801
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,280
Can you hear it?

802
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,420
Every night in my dreams.

803
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,880
I see you.

804
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,900
I feel you.

805
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,080
That is how I know you.

806
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,280
Go on.

807
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,680
Far across the distance.

808
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,420
And spaces between us.

809
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,540
You have come to show you.

810
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,160
Go on.

811
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,680
Near.

812
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,320
Here.

813
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,520
Far.

814
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,500
Wherever you are.

815
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:29,100
I believe that the heart does go on.

816
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,040
Once more.

817
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,840
You open the door.

818
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,380
And you're here.

819
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,840
In my heart.

820
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,960
And my heart will go on.

821
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,360
And on.

822
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,740
There was room on that boat for two of them.

823
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,780
On the little door.

824
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,660
I know that's been said before, but...

825
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,720
Love can touch us one time.

826
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,340
And last for...

827
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,620
Ah!

828
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:09,840
Ah!

829
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,800
Never let go till we're gone.

830
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,180
Love was when I loved you.

831
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,620
One true time.

832
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,680
I hold you.

833
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:37,420
And my life will always go on.

834
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,700
Near.

835
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:43,980
Far.

836
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,760
Wherever you are.

837
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:56,520
I believe that the heart does go on.

838
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,280
Once more.

839
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,400
You open the door.

840
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,620
And you're here.

841
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,280
In my heart.

842
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:20,600
And my heart will go on and on.

843
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,440
And...

844
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:23,960
Where are you?

845
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,440
In the dark?

846
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,600
Don't I sound like Celine Dion?

847
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,160
It's my Celine Dion impression.

848
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,020
Are you impressed?

849
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,440
Please be impressed.

850
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,240
Please clap.

851
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,720
Okay here we go.

852
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,240
Here we go.

853
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,280
Well, the big...

854
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,340
You're here...

855
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,340
There's nothing I fear...

856
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,940
And I know...

857
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,500
No!

858
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,860
Please!

859
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,780
We'll stay...

860
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,480
Forever this way...

861
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,280
You are safe in my heart and...

862
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,720
My heart will...

863
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:21,100
Go on and on...

864
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,130
This one.

865
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,310
My chat froze again!

866
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,410
I'm just gonna die.

867
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,030
No!

868
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,430
Let me... let me fix you guys!

869
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,170
Let me...

870
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,490
Let me fix you guys!

871
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,390
I don't know why you keep breaking.

872
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,350
Usually it doesn't happen like this.

873
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,210
Let me try... is there a refresh?

874
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:04,950
No?

875
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,570
Let me just open you eyes up again.

876
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:07,950
Sorry.

877
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:12,490
I have a little way to read chat while I'm streaming in VR, so...

878
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,190
That one...

879
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,210
It went pretty well!

880
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,310
Lampy, thanks for the gifted!

881
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,890
Thank you so much!

882
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,210
Thank you everybody... thank you!

883
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,090
Let's go to another world, eh?

884
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,230
Shall we?

885
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,230
We are in the freezing ocean...

886
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,030
Oh, let me turn off the...

887
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,810
Uhm...

888
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:39,630
The...

889
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:40,690
The...

890
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,350
Blblblbl... Reverb...

891
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,270
There we go.

892
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:46,850
Okay.

893
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,130
I have another world that I would like to go to.

894
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,690
Thank you for the rose.

895
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,910
That was a good performance.

896
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,130
Thank you.

897
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,130
Thank you.

898
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,330
Thank you.

899
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,290
Thank you.

900
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,050
Miss Mel-chan, thanks for the five gifted!

901
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,250
Actual five.

902
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:01,970
I can read it.

903
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:03,830
I can read it.

904
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:05,850
Let's see.

905
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,070
Worlds.

906
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:08,930
Okay.

907
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,810
This one!

908
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:12,490
Okay.

909
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,490
This one!

910
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:14,010
This one!

911
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,430
This one!

912
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:14,790
This one!

913
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,090
This one!

914
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,370
I'm so excited for this one.

915
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:16,610
Hold on.

916
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,450
I can't see it because you guys are in the way.

917
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:19,850
One second.

918
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,530
Let me redo.

919
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,230
I'll do it this way.

920
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:25,710
I'll do it this way.

921
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:26,370
Okay.

922
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:26,970
This one!

923
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:28,890
Get ready.

924
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,770
Actually, I haven't been to any of these.

925
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:32,890
So...

926
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:34,870
Wait a second.

927
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,690
So I honestly don't know...

928
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,210
Karafun, get out of here please.

929
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,410
I don't know how many of them are.

930
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,710
But that's part of the fun, right?

931
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,070
This is Outer Heaven, isn't it?

932
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:48,690
No.

933
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,650
No.

934
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,710
Close, but no.

935
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,090
Okay.

936
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,610
Let's go.

937
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,510
Hopefully it's not too loud.

938
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,810
Oh, this one's hefty.

939
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:00,830
Hefty.

940
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,150
Hefty.

941
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:01,550
Hefty.

942
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,050
Screams made it more realistic.

943
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,450
Hopefully they're not too like...

944
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,250
Too like... for your ears.

945
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:10,530
You know?

946
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,650
Why is it keep...

947
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,510
Why do you guys keep freezing on me?

948
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,790
Oh my gosh.

949
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,450
Oh, there it is.

950
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:20,690
Okay.

951
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,050
What is this?

952
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,030
What do you guys see?

953
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,150
What is this?

954
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,410
What is this place?

955
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,470
Oh, hold on.

956
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,190
Wait, hold on.

957
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,720
Oh, hey there.

958
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,840
Oops, sorry.

959
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,880
Welcome back, soldier.

960
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,440
Welcome back, soldier.

961
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,640
It's time to fly.

962
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,120
It's time to dog fight.

963
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,020
It's time to...

964
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,660
Fly!

965
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,680
Oh, sorry.

966
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,400
Hold on.

967
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,500
Big reveal.

968
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,140
Big reveal.

969
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,160
Yeah!

970
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,140
This plane.

971
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:16,990
Yeah!

972
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,930
We're going to the danger zone, baby.

973
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:26,070
Highway to the danger zone.

974
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,950
Highway to the danger zone.

975
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:34,330
Highway to the danger zone.

976
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:34,690
Highway to the danger zone.

977
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:34,910
Highway to the danger zone.

978
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:34,930
Yeah.

979
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,950
Shoulder cam time?

980
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:36,530
Absolutely.

981
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,190
Alright.

982
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,950
Hold on.

983
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,050
Let me get in position.

984
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,210
We're actually going to fly it.

985
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,030
We're actually going to fly it.

986
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,890
It says... how to fly.

987
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,390
You can fly without an airplane.

988
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,970
In most flight worlds.

989
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,130
But this is useful for...

990
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,850
Eight pages.

991
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:54,290
Okay.

992
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,150
Jump...

993
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,410
Finally the jet hag.

994
00:42:58,770 --> 00:42:59,530
Shut up!

995
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,410
Jump whilst in the air.

996
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,330
Pull the left or right trigger.

997
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,190
Left trigger moves you out.

998
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,630
Right trigger moves you in the direction that you...

999
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,670
That's all I need to know, right?

1000
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:10,770
Wait a second!

1001
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,450
You guys, they have the Top Gun Maverick OST!

1002
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:14,450
No!

1003
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,990
No!

1004
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,350
No way!

1005
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,210
Goodness gracious!

1006
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,590
Great balls of fire!

1007
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,030
No way!

1008
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:22,930
Oh my gosh!

1009
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,250
No, no, no!

1010
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,310
Wait, you guys, look!

1011
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,310
They also have like a bunch of Gundam OSTs and stuff.

1012
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,370
What?

1013
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,390
Oh my God!

1014
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,970
Where is the... Oh, there's Ace Combat OST!

1015
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,310
Oh my God.

1016
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,150
Oh my God.

1017
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,050
No way!

1018
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,670
Oh my God!

1019
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,970
Oh my God!

1020
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,190
Is it playing?

1021
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,000
Is it playing?

1022
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,900
I don't hear it.

1023
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,180
Oh, wait!

1024
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,440
I think I turned off...

1025
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:11,920
World...

1026
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,270
Oh my God, you guys.

1027
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,090
Okay, let's go!

1028
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,570
Which plane should we take?

1029
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:33,990
DMCA time!

1030
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:34,950
No, no, no, no!

1031
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,070
It's like we're playing the game!

1032
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:37,610
Don't worry about it.

1033
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,350
Is it really loud?

1034
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,010
Hold on, let me check.

1035
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,770
Let me double check that it's not so loud that it's like...

1036
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:46,870
Okay, it's good enough, yeah.

1037
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good, it's good, it's good.

1038
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,750
Take the F-16.

1039
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:54,250
How do I get in?

1040
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:54,750
Oh!

1041
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:56,110
Oh my God!

1042
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,950
Oh my God, you guys!

1043
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,500
We're taking off!

1044
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:03,780
This is it.

1045
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:05,980
Oh my God.

1046
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,260
Oh my God, wait.

1047
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,840
Hold on, let me fix this real quick.

1048
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,140
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

1049
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:25,830
How do I go?

1050
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:27,730
I'm gonna go!

1051
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,130
I think?

1052
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,330
How do I start?

1053
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:32,710
How do I start?

1054
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,130
I'm in the wrong seat?

1055
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,170
Oh, you're so right.

1056
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,670
Wait, how do I get into the front seat?

1057
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:49,830
Oh!

1058
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:56,420
Oh my God, it's really loud.

1059
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,240
What?

1060
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,400
Grabbing the trigger!

1061
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,680
I can't hear anything!

1062
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,660
You guys, we're moving!

1063
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,080
I'm home!

1064
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:12,680
Uh...

1065
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,700
We stopped moving.

1066
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,300
Something happened.

1067
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,360
Hold on.

1068
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:19,520
I'm doing it!

1069
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:21,600
Uh...

1070
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,000
Uh...

1071
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,300
Um...

1072
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,330
Something's going on.

1073
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:35,750
Uh...

1074
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,830
Close the canopy?

1075
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,670
Oh, I have to do that.

1076
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,290
How do I do anything, though?

1077
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:43,990
Uh...

1078
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,210
It's so loud!

1079
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,060
Is it behind me or no?

1080
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,020
Oh my God.

1081
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,720
Should've read the instructions.

1082
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,180
No, no, we're okay.

1083
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,440
Equip?

1084
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,040
Equip what?

1085
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:03,720
What am I equipping?

1086
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,620
We're okay.

1087
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,840
Keep that up.

1088
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,420
I've launched enough Top Guns to know what's going on!

1089
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,640
I don't think my hands can reach the...

1090
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,060
I don't think my hands can reach the...

1091
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,140
I don't think my hands can reach the...

1092
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,500
The controls!

1093
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:30,930
I gotta put on my seatbelt, maybe!

1094
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:32,510
No?

1095
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,260
Um, that's the eject.

1096
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,080
Don't want that.

1097
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,520
We'll turn it down some.

1098
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,820
I can't reach this.

1099
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,450
Don't pull the yellow lever!

1100
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,450
I'm not trying to!

1101
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,650
This is what I'm not trying to!

1102
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,510
I'm just trying to touch anything!

1103
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,270
You guys, I wanna fly!

1104
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,770
Let's go read the instructions.

1105
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,710
Let's go read the instructions, right?

1106
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,800
I know why I can't fly the plane!

1107
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,380
I know why I can't fly the plane.

1108
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:39,510
It's because...

1109
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:43,870
I wasn't...

1110
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,670
It's because I wasn't in gear!

1111
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:51,930
It's because I wasn't...

1112
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,470
I wasn't looking the part.

1113
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,410
It's because I wasn't...

1114
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:55,870
Look at this.

1115
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,570
Look how cool I am!

1116
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:04,370
Oh my god!

1117
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,570
Okay, hold on.

1118
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,470
Follow me.

1119
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,310
Follow me.

1120
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:14,030
We're gonna have to go turn off the music.

1121
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:18,810
Wait a second, you guys!

1122
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,970
I'm on the leaderboard!

1123
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:22,490
That's me!

1124
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,130
Oh, Instance Master.

1125
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:29,510
Me?

1126
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:32,790
A master?

1127
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,010
No!

1128
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,450
I'm a maid!

1129
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,150
I'm a maid!

1130
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,290
I'm a maid!

1131
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,010
No!

1132
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,890
I serve the master!

1133
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,370
No!

1134
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:48,570
That's silly talk!

1135
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:49,950
Silly talk!

1136
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:52,750
Okay, let's read the rules.

1137
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:54,850
Okay.

1138
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:57,450
Entering a vehicle, stand next to a seat and point below the...

1139
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,170
That's what we did?

1140
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,550
Throttle control.

1141
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,210
Whilst in the pilot seat of the vehicle, you can control the throttle by...

1142
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:03,910
Grip...

1143
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,910
Grip button on the left controller.

1144
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,510
Any time you are holding the grip down, you are holding the throttle.

1145
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,240
Okay...

1146
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,260
What else is there?

1147
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:15,600
Oh!

1148
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,160
Wow, this is really detailed.

1149
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,200
Deaths won?

1150
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,140
Deaths won?

1151
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:24,900
No...

1152
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,200
It doesn't even say that...

1153
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,300
It doesn't even say that...

1154
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,600
Oh.

1155
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,900
I did... How did I die?

1156
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,540
I did... How did I die?

1157
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:38,880
What?

1158
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,340
This is incorrect!

1159
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,440
This is incorrect!

1160
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,840
Don't look at this part!

1161
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,020
Don't look at this part!

1162
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,000
That's not accurate.

1163
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,140
That's not accurate.

1164
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,900
I completely...

1165
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,540
I literally didn't even take off.

1166
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,780
How did I die?

1167
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,360
It knows.

1168
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,960
You're a ghost.

1169
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,480
Yeah, but in the game, I'm not a ghost.

1170
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,020
Okay?

1171
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,180
Uh...

1172
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,320
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

1173
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,980
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

1174
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,180
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

1175
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,780
Flight limits.

1176
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,700
Never even took off.

1177
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,580
Somehow died.

1178
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,980
I must drive on to the cab...

1179
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,140
I must drive on to the cab...

1180
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,240
Wow, there's like a thing up there.

1181
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,220
I see like a...

1182
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,820
A hot air balloon or something.

1183
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,380
I see other planes.

1184
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,180
They can do it.

1185
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:31,700
I can do it.

1186
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,360
If you die IRL, you die in the game.

1187
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,280
Oh no!

1188
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:36,500
Um...

1189
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:38,840
Flight...

1190
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,180
Limits.

1191
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:40,400
Okay.

1192
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,080
Then the cruise.

1193
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,200
Catapult.

1194
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,260
Wait, what was...

1195
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,660
This is all this stuff, right?

1196
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,060
Nope.

1197
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,160
Oh yeah.

1198
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,580
The HUD.

1199
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,560
Oh...

1200
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,660
We'll get it.

1201
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,420
We'll get it.

1202
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,640
Keyboard!

1203
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,000
See?

1204
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,200
This is supposed to be played on.

1205
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:03,840
Keyboard!

1206
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,800
Not my fault.

1207
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,960
Mucho texto.

1208
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,800
Refueling!

1209
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,290
Look at the way I run.

1210
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:26,800
Wow!

1211
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,160
Wait, there's other planes.

1212
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,280
Let's check them out.

1213
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,480
Skippa, skippa.

1214
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,480
Yeah, pretty much.

1215
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:34,720
Whoa...

1216
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,720
This place is kind of beefy.

1217
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,780
It like really lags.

1218
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,100
It's okay though.

1219
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:40,680
Looks good.

1220
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,240
Got that hunchback.

1221
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,720
Wow!

1222
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,320
YouTuber?

1223
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,460
Question mark?

1224
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,120
Let's...

1225
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,320
Guys, we're taking...

1226
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,260
Diamond dog!

1227
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,440
Diamond dog?

1228
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,300
At the top?

1229
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,000
I think we're taking this plane.

1230
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:11,780
Not...

1231
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,580
It's like... Diamond dog...

1232
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,620
Like...

1233
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,000
Bootleg diamond dog.

1234
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,420
Wow, anime.

1235
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,660
Let's take the Itasha plane!

1236
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:23,200
Hold on.

1237
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,440
Before we go though...

1238
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,620
Let's get some pictures in front of it, you guys.

1239
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,120
Okay?

1240
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,080
You can take some pictures of me in front of my plane.

1241
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,240
Oh wait, you need the anime in it.

1242
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:37,900
Hold on.

1243
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,820
Where did you guys go?

1244
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,060
There you go.

1245
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:52,760
Cheese.

1246
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,780
Cheese.

1247
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,320
Cheese.

1248
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,320
Cheese.

1249
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,520
Cheese.

1250
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,480
Cheese.

1251
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,080
You didn't hear my butt crack, did you?

1252
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,920
You didn't hear my butt crack, did you?

1253
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,520
Cheese.

1254
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,760
Cheese.

1255
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:15,400
Ow!

1256
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,960
Let me move away from my desk.

1257
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:20,500
Let me move away from my desk.

1258
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,720
Seeing in VR is dangerous.

1259
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,460
Did you guys hear the bonk?

1260
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,580
I'm okay.

1261
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,340
It was just my wrist.

1262
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:37,700
Okay.

1263
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,980
It was my wrist.

1264
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,340
What's another...

1265
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,220
Gimme a pose.

1266
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,680
Gimme a pose.

1267
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,160
Gimme a pose.

1268
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,360
Gimme a pose.

1269
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:45,860
Gimme a pose.

1270
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,560
Gimme a pose.

1271
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,720
Gimme a pose.

1272
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,440
Gimme a pose.

1273
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,540
Gimme a pose.

1274
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,160
Gimme a pose.

1275
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,060
Gimme a T pose.

1276
00:54:59,590 --> 00:54:59,950
Worm?

1277
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,750
Worm?

1278
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,260
Is this good?

1279
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,680
Jacko pose.

1280
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,760
Isn't that like...

1281
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,180
Like this?

1282
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,420
I don't know if I'm doing it right.

1283
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:21,750
This is like a dog.

1284
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:22,930
It's like this, right?

1285
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:25,330
I'm Jacko pose.

1286
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,110
Like that, right?

1287
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,070
Okay, I think we're good.

1288
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,850
I think we're ready.

1289
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:37,570
Oh, sorry.

1290
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:38,810
I didn't mean to leave you behind.

1291
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,170
Alright, guys.

1292
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,280
Okay, here we go.

1293
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,280
Go here?

1294
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,500
Why do we go and then we stop?

1295
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,020
Na na na na na...

1296
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,340
Na na na na na.....

1297
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,920
Na na....

1298
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,500
Na na na na...

1299
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,600
Na na na....

1300
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,840
Na na

1301
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,020
na...

1302
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:39,680
Na na na na na.....

1303
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,560
Na na na na na....

1304
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,460
Where -

1305
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,400
Why won't you stop the stamping?

1306
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,200
Na...

1307
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,020
Na...

1308
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,580
Na na na....

1309
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,500
Thumbstick?

1310
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,160
Thumbstick doesn't do anything.

1311
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,420
Oh, I'm shooting!

1312
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:16,970
Canopy!

1313
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:19,070
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1314
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:19,770
I did it.

1315
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:20,370
I did the canopy.

1316
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:20,930
I did the canopy.

1317
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:21,670
Cruise!

1318
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:24,990
Oh, sorry.

1319
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,630
It's so quiet now.

1320
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,430
Feels good.

1321
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,130
Are we okay down there?

1322
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:39,230
I think we're cleared for takeoff.

1323
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:42,350
Hey mom!

1324
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,590
Highway to the... hold the trigger.

1325
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,270
And move.

1326
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:53,530
Oh, my bad.

1327
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,850
Oh, not gun.

1328
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:56,930
BOMBS!

1329
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:57,970
Oh, I can do a bomb.

1330
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,030
But I'm not gonna do that.

1331
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:05,630
Hold on.

1332
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:13,600
Um...

1333
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:18,830
Canopy?

1334
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,090
Oh, nope.

1335
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:21,730
Oh my god!

1336
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:27,450
Guys, I think I'm gonna throw up.

1337
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:29,910
Guys, I think I'm gonna throw up!

1338
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:31,390
Guys, I think I'm gonna throw up!

1339
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,690
Guys, I think I'm gonna throw up!

1340
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:35,790
I'm gonna throw up!

1341
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,800
We're okay.

1342
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,770
I think this is a sitting activity.

1343
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:58,130
This is a sitting activity, I think.

1344
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,790
Wait, why am I... why are we sideways?

1345
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:03,450
Why are we sideways?

1346
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,940
Why are you guys sideways?

1347
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,000
Okay...

1348
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,100
We took off!

1349
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:19,960
We took off!

1350
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,380
You guys, we did it!

1351
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,920
We flew!

1352
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:43,820
Guys...

1353
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,500
Gosh, I have nerves.

1354
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,440
We almost died but we didn't.

1355
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,020
But we didn't...

1356
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:53,900
Alright, let's sing a song!

1357
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,420
Let's go sing it in front of our plan...

1358
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,700
Let's go sing it in front of our plane.

1359
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:04,410
This way.

1360
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:06,610
This way.

1361
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:08,470
Oh my gosh, it's back!

1362
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:09,190
It's still there!

1363
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:09,730
It's still there!

1364
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:10,250
Do you see it?

1365
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:10,530
Do you see it?

1366
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:10,750
Do you see it?

1367
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:12,670
We survived!

1368
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:13,570
We survived!

1369
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:14,890
Should we try again?

1370
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:16,630
Oh, sorry, you're over here.

1371
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:20,730
I'm informing you, the family of the pilot was at lost at sea.

1372
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:23,870
The last words I'm going to throw up.

1373
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:26,070
It was actually really...

1374
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:26,850
Raiders?

1375
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,370
Welcome, Raiders.

1376
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:29,830
Thank you!

1377
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:32,930
Hold on, let me get to my plane.

1378
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,330
There we go.

1379
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:40,930
Oh, you can't probably recognize me.

1380
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:41,650
I'm Mint!

1381
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:44,430
I'm in my gear because I'm a professional.

1382
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:46,450
Top Gun.

1383
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:49,510
Guys?

1384
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:52,110
Maverick who?

1385
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:59,710
Oh my god, Top Gun.

1386
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:01,530
That's me, baby.

1387
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:02,510
Top Gun.

1388
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,390
Who raided me?

1389
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,210
Thank you so much!

1390
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:07,470
Thank you!

1391
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:08,310
Sorry.

1392
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:10,510
Looking like Goose.

1393
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:11,370
Oh my god.

1394
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:12,890
Talk to me, Goose.

1395
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:14,550
Talk to me, Goose.

1396
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,550
I'm going to sing some karaoke.

1397
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,750
I have two songs that I want to sing here.

1398
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:23,050
Since this is VR chat and karaoke time.

1399
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:24,550
So...

1400
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:29,250
I'm just going to sing some karaoke in front of our plane.

1401
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,750
Oh, sorry if I'm a little all tied up here.

1402
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:33,130
Thanks for the five gifted!

1403
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:33,870
Thank you!

1404
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:36,950
Okay, okay, okay.

1405
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,160
Okay, I think I got it.

1406
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,840
No spelling errors.

1407
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,660
Oh, wait.

1408
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,040
I think I spelled it wrong.

1409
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,780
I think I got it now.

1410
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,940
Oh, no, I spelled it wrong again.

1411
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,680
Sorry, it's really hard to type.

1412
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,300
No, I spelled it... W.

1413
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:02,880
No W.

1414
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:03,900
Okay, here we go.

1415
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,220
I'm good.

1416
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,420
Dunna Dun dun dun

1417
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,720
Revving up your engine Listen to her howling What?

1418
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,480
Roar?

1419
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,640
Sorry I can't read.

1420
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:39,300
Metal under tension Begging you to touch and go Ahh!

1421
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,200
I've read it but it's small!

1422
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,600
Highway to the...

1423
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:49,620
Danger zone I can't read the lyrics right now Turn to the...

1424
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,900
Danger zone

1425
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:54,880
Yeah, there we go.

1426
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,160
Heading into twilight, spreading out her wings tonight.

1427
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:05,940
She got you jumping off the deck, shoving into overdrive.

1428
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,420
Highway to the danger zone.

1429
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:18,520
I'll take you right into the danger zone.

1430
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,940
You'll never say hello to you.

1431
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,440
Wait, get it on.

1432
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,280
Run, run, overload.

1433
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,980
Wait, what's this part again?

1434
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,180
Oh no, it's freezing.

1435
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,500
I can't read it.

1436
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,300
Then you can go.

1437
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,200
I'm gonna go!

1438
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,100
Yeah!

1439
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,780
The hotter the edge, the hotter the intensity.

1440
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:19,440
Highway to the danger zone.

1441
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:25,660
I'm gonna take you right into the danger zone.

1442
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:32,200
Highway to the danger zone.

1443
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,620
Head into the danger zone.

1444
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,040
Highway

1445
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,820
to the danger zone.

1446
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:58,980
I'm gonna take you right into the danger zone.

1447
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,620
Highway to the danger zone.

1448
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:11,880
Head into the danger zone.

1449
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,240
Highway to the danger zone.

1450
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,600
Ride into danger zone.

1451
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:29,500
Highway to the danger zone.

1452
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,760
Ride into the danger zone.

1453
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,760
I think it's like overheating my computer.

1454
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,060
Woo!

1455
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:49,920
That was good.

1456
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:50,520
Hold on.

1457
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,540
Let me see if I can make you guys stop freezing on me.

1458
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,220
Thank you for the claps!

1459
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,520
You guys...

1460
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:07,720
You're a Top Gun.

1461
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,720
You guys are the toppest gun.

1462
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,900
You guys are... Top Gun here?

1463
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,620
You guys... Wait.

1464
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,380
You guys, okay?

1465
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,280
Don't ever forget that.

1466
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,920
Don't ever forget how...

1467
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,840
You guys are top... a top.

1468
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,660
You guys are a Top Gun.

1469
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:29,600
Okay?

1470
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,540
I'm trying to brush my hair out of my ears.

1471
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:39,120
Deserves all the claps.

1472
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,180
Thank you.

1473
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:42,660
Alright.

1474
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,660
Maybe for the next song I should change back.

1475
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:46,360
I don't know.

1476
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,020
I feel... I'm feeling this though.

1477
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,680
I'm feeling this.

1478
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,420
Let's just stick with English song.

1479
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,420
I was going to sing...

1480
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,260
I was going to sing Love Deterrence but...

1481
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:59,840
Maybe next time.

1482
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,580
Since my computer is like overheating.

1483
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,780
Looks good on me.

1484
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,700
I like the fit.

1485
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,720
This model is great.

1486
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,820
It's awesome actually.

1487
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,300
Feels like...

1488
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,480
But I'm like so... I'm so stoic and mysterious.

1489
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,760
You can't see what I'm thinking.

1490
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,600
You can't see...

1491
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,520
How I want to peel it.

1492
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:23,880
Actually...

1493
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,160
Wait.

1494
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,060
Does it have any emotes?

1495
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:25,280
Hold on.

1496
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:25,600
Let me see.

1497
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,480
Whoa!

1498
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,140
I can change the color.

1499
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:38,820
And then also what's this?

1500
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,920
I can change...

1501
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,380
What helmet I want.

1502
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:43,920
Wait.

1503
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:44,700
What do you guys like?

1504
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,260
This one?

1505
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:47,700
This one?

1506
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,260
Hi.

1507
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,220
Peace...

1508
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:50,600
Peace...

1509
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,240
Peace...

1510
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:51,560
Peace...

1511
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:51,740
Peace...

1512
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,980
Or do you like this one?

1513
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,280
Peace, peace, peace, peace.

1514
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,680
Which one do you like?

1515
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,680
Turquoise color.

1516
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,840
It only has like...

1517
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,120
these colors.

1518
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,560
It won't let me do in between.

1519
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,490
The circular one, the first one.

1520
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:13,030
This one?

1521
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:14,570
Peace, peace.

1522
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:16,350
Peace, peace.

1523
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,470
Peace, peace.

1524
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:22,450
Peace, peace, peace.

1525
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,510
Oh, hold on.

1526
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,840
Quick actions.

1527
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,480
Does nothing.

1528
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,040
Peace, peace.

1529
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,560
Peace.

1530
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,560
Come on.

1531
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,420
Come on, peace.

1532
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:41,500
Peace.

1533
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,760
Yay!

1534
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,680
Oh, there we go.

1535
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:46,060
Yay!

1536
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,200
Cool.

1537
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,160
Oh.

1538
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,100
Trying to just do a thumbs up.

1539
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:58,980
There.

1540
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,460
Cool.

1541
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:00,940
Cool.

1542
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,360
Oh my gosh, I look so cool.

1543
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,220
I kinda wanna go again.

1544
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,400
Let's try it one more time.

1545
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,220
Okay, guys?

1546
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:08,900
I won't throw up.

1547
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,260
I promise.

1548
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:11,640
Maybe.

1549
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,300
Who knows?

1550
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,080
I don't know.

1551
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,960
I might throw up.

1552
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,240
Okie dokie!

1553
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:24,360
Let's do...

1554
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,220
Let's do... Canopy!

1555
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,460
And it goes down.

1556
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,520
Nice and quiet.

1557
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:32,160
Wait, you guys are like so far away.

1558
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:32,600
Hold on.

1559
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:40,770
Nice.

1560
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:46,510
Hold on, I'll move you a little bit like this.

1561
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:47,850
Hold on, I'll move you a little bit like this.

1562
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,510
How about like...

1563
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:49,970
Like that.

1564
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:51,770
They can still see me.

1565
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:53,350
Oh, sorry.

1566
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:54,570
Hi, mom.

1567
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:55,090
Hi, mom.

1568
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:56,230
Hi, mom.

1569
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:56,570
Hi, mom.

1570
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:56,910
Hi, mom.

1571
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,230
And we're gonna go...

1572
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:03,170
Oh, wait.

1573
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:05,150
What was it again?

1574
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:05,890
Oh, cat...

1575
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:09,670
Here we go!

1576
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:11,510
Pull up!

1577
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:11,870
Pull up!

1578
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:12,190
Pull up!

1579
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:13,290
Oh, gosh!

1580
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:14,570
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!

1581
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,490
What's the beep, beep, beeps mean?

1582
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:17,030
Wait, can you guys see anything?

1583
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:17,670
Oh, god.

1584
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:18,730
We're gonna crash again.

1585
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:19,090
I'm sorry.

1586
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:42,640
Oh, I'm close.

1587
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:42,920
I'm close.

1588
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,060
There you are!

1589
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:44,360
There you are!

1590
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,840
This is so like Outer Wilds.

1591
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,560
That's a great idea!

1592
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,540
Let's go to Outer Wilds!

1593
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,140
Yeah!

1594
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:57,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1595
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:00,210
Let's go to Outer Wilds!

1596
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:01,530
Let's go!

1597
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:08,030
Let's go!

1598
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:08,930
Yeah, yeah, baby.

1599
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:12,990
Let's go.

1600
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,390
It's initializing.

1601
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:16,970
Connecting.

1602
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:24,760
Highway to the danger zone.

1603
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:29,560
If you experience motion sickness, I advise you leave immediately.

1604
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,520
You will be subjected to unnatural gravity.

1605
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:40,980
And other spatial effects that may induce nausea and or headaches in unexperienced VR players.

1606
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,840
Proceed with caution.

1607
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,230
I'll be fine.

1608
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,190
Let's just try it.

1609
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:54,870
Whoa!

1610
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:56,550
Whoa!

1611
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:59,530
Enter the sun station?

1612
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:00,910
We're going into the sun station.

1613
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,630
Wait, you can explore five areas.

1614
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:11,290
Timber Hearth, Timber Hearth's Moon, Ash Twin, Ember Twin, Dark Bramble.

1615
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,890
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1616
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:14,930
We're going to enter the sun station!

1617
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:17,090
Oh.

1618
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:17,490
Whoa!

1619
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,800
Why can't I grab you anymore?

1620
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,080
Whoa!

1621
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,620
Whoa, there's an observation pool and everything!

1622
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:34,460
Wow!

1623
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,360
This is kind of freaky.

1624
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:41,380
Why can't I?

1625
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,460
Oh, I think it's on lock.

1626
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:42,900
That's why.

1627
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:44,780
Yeah, that's why.

1628
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:45,060
Okay.

1629
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,860
It's kind of loud.

1630
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,680
Let me turn it down just a little.

1631
01:12:58,940 --> 01:12:59,360
Hello?

1632
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:00,660
There we go.

1633
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:02,400
Okay.

1634
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,160
Welcome, everybody, to Outer Wilds Sun Station.

1635
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,140
I'm your host, Minto Phantom.

1636
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,580
Pilot version.

1637
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,060
Pilot Minto.

1638
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,580
Where are you guys at, actually?

1639
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,120
Oh, there you are.

1640
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:16,340
Okay.

1641
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,160
Let's see what other places we have.

1642
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:22,800
We can go to...

1643
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:26,440
Let's see.

1644
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:27,780
Snap turning.

1645
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,360
Oh, I can turn that on if it...

1646
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:29,660
Oh, wait.

1647
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,300
Let me get a little... There we go.

1648
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,480
We can do snap turning.

1649
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:37,520
Actually, I'm okay actually right now with the non-snap.

1650
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:38,600
Oh, never mind.

1651
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,220
I need it on.

1652
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:39,600
Just kidding.

1653
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,940
If Mint loses chat again, it's because we're quantum.

1654
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,920
Let me turn on snap turning.

1655
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:50,140
Okay.

1656
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,660
Oh, that's much better.

1657
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,100
You guys okay over there?

1658
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:54,820
Okay.

1659
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,800
Let's go into the observation pool.

1660
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,650
Nothing to observe.

1661
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:07,970
Everything is fine.

1662
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:10,770
Pequod!

1663
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:13,810
Yeah.

1664
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:16,250
Pequod.

1665
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:17,210
What is world inspector?

1666
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:21,210
World inspector.

1667
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,730
It says...

1668
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,790
L...

1669
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:29,830
Use.

1670
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:31,890
Can't use it.

1671
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:35,250
Oh, use this.

1672
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:36,350
Oh, here we go.

1673
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:36,590
Here we go.

1674
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:38,290
Whoa.

1675
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,110
Oh, use again.

1676
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:45,710
Use.

1677
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:46,830
There we go.

1678
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,010
Whoa.

1679
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:53,030
Oh, I think this is where we choose where to go.

1680
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,810
Let's go to Timber Hearth, you guys.

1681
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:56,710
Let's go to Timber Hearth.

1682
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:58,610
Boom, boom, boom.

1683
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:01,290
Can I go?

1684
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:06,630
Oh!

1685
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:09,430
Oh, uh...

1686
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:13,650
Can you guys see?

1687
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,970
Where are you?

1688
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:16,770
Where are you guys?

1689
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:18,230
Stop being quantum.

1690
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,230
Oh, I see you, I see you, I see you.

1691
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:20,470
I see you, I see you.

1692
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:22,410
Dum, dum.

1693
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:24,170
Dum, dum.

1694
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:29,340
I have to get you guys back up right.

1695
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,200
What's wrong with you?

1696
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:33,260
I have to get you guys back up right.

1697
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:33,260
What's wrong with you?

1698
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:33,840
Is it the gravity?

1699
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,080
Why is it defaulting to this?

1700
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,480
It's defaulting to sideways.

1701
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:38,900
That's weird.

1702
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,120
Okay, I'm gonna stop you guys from being sideways.

1703
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:44,600
Uh,

1704
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,190
if I could let go of you.

1705
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:52,350
Alright.

1706
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,710
So sorry for the disturbance.

1707
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:58,490
Dum, dum.

1708
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,080
I'm gonna cry.

1709
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,840
Oh, I'm gonna cry.

1710
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,300
Oh, there's the sun and everything.

1711
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:15,880
Oh, there's the sun and everything.

1712
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,340
Oh, there's the sun and everything.

1713
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,180
This is super low poly.

1714
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:18,940
This is super low poly.

1715
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,980
Timber Hearth, look at this.

1716
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,180
Timber Hearth, look at this.

1717
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,580
It looks great though, don't get me wrong.

1718
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,280
Actually, the galaxies...

1719
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,080
Oh, my bad.

1720
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,160
The galaxies look so great too.

1721
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,320
I guess you kinda can't see the stars, can you?

1722
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,480
In my view, I can see them.

1723
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,840
I can see every star.

1724
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,120
All of them.

1725
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:45,280
I can see this one, and that one, and this one, and that one, and this one, and that one.

1726
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,940
I can see almost every star in the universe.

1727
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:53,950
Let's see.

1728
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:56,130
Alright, let's keep going.

1729
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:58,470
Oh, we're in the water.

1730
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:00,690
Dum, dum, dum, dum.

1731
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,090
Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum.

1732
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:04,570
Low poly.

1733
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:04,970
Eek!

1734
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:07,090
What's this?

1735
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:07,910
Is this the...

1736
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:10,010
Where are we?

1737
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:11,970
Wait, is this the...

1738
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,670
The observation?

1739
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:15,810
Wait, is this supposed to be the...

1740
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:17,630
No, this is... Yeah, wait.

1741
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:19,690
You guys, I think we're at the...

1742
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:20,370
Museum?

1743
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:25,310
It looks a little different than I remember.

1744
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:29,830
But the music...

1745
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:30,950
is so nice.

1746
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:31,790
Do you think we'll die?

1747
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:34,130
Do you think if we're here for long enough we'll die?

1748
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:36,750
Are we in the floor?

1749
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:40,010
How did you get so low?

1750
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:43,570
There you go.

1751
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,450
And you're kind of crooked.

1752
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,110
I can't help you guys anymore.

1753
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,150
I can't help you guys any longer.

1754
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:53,850
You guys need to help yourselves, okay?

1755
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:00,230
I feel tilted.

1756
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,230
I'm feeling woozy.

1757
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:06,050
If I auto-level, it does that, so...

1758
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,830
I have to manually do it.

1759
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:08,310
I'm so sorry.

1760
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:11,350
It's kind of really relaxing here, though.

1761
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,350
I can see!

1762
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:15,750
I can see the moon from here!

1763
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:21,390
Can you see it?

1764
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:22,710
There!

1765
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:25,350
That's our moon!

1766
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:27,670
That's our moon!

1767
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:28,450
That's our moon!

1768
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,040
You see it?

1769
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:34,080
How do we get there?

1770
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:36,800
I'm lost.

1771
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,740
Wait, you guys, I accidentally exited the building!

1772
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,020
And I can't get back in!

1773
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,100
Wait, you guys!

1774
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,480
I think I...

1775
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,440
I clipped through the walls and I can't get back inside!

1776
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:45,520
Oh.

1777
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,120
Okay, hold on.

1778
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:46,640
I'm coming.

1779
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,340
I'm coming for you!

1780
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,360
She's speedrunning.

1781
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,540
Good thing I'm wearing this helmet, or else I wouldn't be able to breathe.

1782
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,140
Look at that moon!

1783
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,100
I mean, sorry...

1784
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,480
Look at all those chickens!

1785
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,080
Shut up!

1786
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,220
Shut up!

1787
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,260
I don't want to see you guys talking, okay?

1788
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,920
I don't even want to...

1789
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:33,320
I don't want to see you guys talking.

1790
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,220
I'm gonna lift you up some.

1791
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,860
Is there anything else down there?

1792
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,600
Can I walk on this?

1793
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,800
Guys, if I die...

1794
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,840
If I die...

1795
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:04,000
You'll come with me, right?

1796
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,980
You'll come after me, right?

1797
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,280
Take my hand!

1798
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,540
Take my hand!

1799
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:13,500
Take my hand!

1800
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:13,760
Wisp!

1801
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,320
It's your time to jump!

1802
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:17,620
Let's go!

1803
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,620
Let's go!

1804
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:24,920
I made it!

1805
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,680
I made it!

1806
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,180
Oh no, I'm stuck outside here.

1807
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:34,940
Wait, you guys.

1808
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:35,940
There's a wall.

1809
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,260
You can't see it, but there's a wall.

1810
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,100
Oh, you guys, I can't get inside.

1811
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:40,400
Hold on, I'll show you.

1812
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:42,340
I can't...

1813
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,680
I can't get inside.

1814
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:45,280
You guys, I'm trapped.

1815
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,640
You guys, I'm trapped.

1816
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,120
You guys, I'm...

1817
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:50,900
You guys, I'm trapped.

1818
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,440
Let me in!

1819
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,160
Please!

1820
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,100
Please, let me in!

1821
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,660
Oh, guys!

1822
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,220
Guys, I'm slipping!

1823
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:03,980
Guys, I'm slipping!

1824
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:06,120
Guys, guys, I don't mean to alarm you.

1825
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,180
I'm on a cliff right now, you guys.

1826
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,540
Please, you guys.

1827
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,040
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm in a really bad predicament right now.

1828
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:13,640
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm in a really bad predicament right now.

1829
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,200
Okay, I'm gonna...

1830
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,920
I'm gonna jump to this one over here.

1831
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,500
There's another one?

1832
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:18,760
Okay, hold on.

1833
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,340
I'm gonna do...

1834
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,280
Behavior, look at me.

1835
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,440
Look at me!

1836
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:23,580
Look at me!

1837
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:24,500
Struggling!

1838
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,100
Okay, see this other platform right here?

1839
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:26,880
I'm gonna jump to it.

1840
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:27,880
Okay, here we go.

1841
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:29,180
Okay, here we go.

1842
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:33,920
Okay, here we go.

1843
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:34,500
Okay.

1844
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,700
It's not that far.

1845
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:38,300
It's not that far.

1846
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,000
And there's, like, less gravity here, right?

1847
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,260
Alright, here we go.

1848
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,420
I'm gonna make it!

1849
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:56,440
Guys...

1850
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,980
I have nowhere else to go.

1851
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,960
Guys, nowhere else to go.

1852
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:06,720
But down.

1853
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:19,780
Ouch!

1854
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,730
Let's go to another world, shall we?

1855
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:31,930
How long have I been streaming for?

1856
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:34,010
Oh my gosh!

1857
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:35,050
Already so long.

1858
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:37,990
I can't stream for so long so long today because of...

1859
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:39,470
you know.

1860
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:41,150
Let's go to this world instead.

1861
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:43,370
Actually, this one.

1862
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:48,610
I haven't been to this one, but by the name of it, it should be something that I enjoy, so...

1863
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:50,710
IKIMASU!

1864
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:52,250
IKIMASU!

1865
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:54,050
Oh, I'm hitting things in my room.

1866
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:54,610
Okay, hold on.

1867
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:55,690
I'm gonna...

1868
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:57,810
I'm hitting things in my room.

1869
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,110
Gotta move around a little bit.

1870
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:01,710
Chuuu!

1871
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:02,290
Thank you!

1872
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:04,210
Chuuu, thank you.

1873
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:05,050
What does it say?

1874
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:06,370
What are you doing?

1875
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:10,950
Can Frogbert please sing Louis Armstrong, what a wonderful world.

1876
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:12,670
Whoa!

1877
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:14,910
What?

1878
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:17,770
That's weird!

1879
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:19,390
What is going on in this world?

1880
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:20,170
Okay, hold on.

1881
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:21,110
Hello, everybody.

1882
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:23,870
Welcome to...

1883
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,110
Fujiyama!

1884
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:29,690
Oh, sorry.

1885
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:31,110
The behavior is always look at me.

1886
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:31,470
That's right.

1887
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:34,770
Fujiyama!

1888
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:38,810
The cat's crying voice is...

1889
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:39,650
Meow!

1890
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,780
If the dog walks...

1891
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:49,360
Where?

1892
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,580
Can we go to Fuji?

1893
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:52,920
I can't read these.

1894
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,480
Can we go to Mount Fuji?

1895
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,440
Mount Fuji?

1896
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,520
Can we go to Mount Fuji?

1897
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,980
Or is it just a dragon?

1898
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:04,600
Flying around.

1899
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:10,460
Hold on.

1900
01:24:12,620 --> 01:24:13,080
Oh!

1901
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,720
I have to get these right!

1902
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,680
You guys, if I get these...

1903
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,120
If I get these questions correct, then we... then an entrance will appear.

1904
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:24,480
Nooooooo!

1905
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,180
Nooooooo!

1906
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,020
I have to get these right.

1907
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:33,040
If I get it wrong, I have to go back.

1908
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,420
I have to restart the world.

1909
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,280
No way.

1910
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:37,520
Okay.

1911
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:41,280
Anybody who's better... who's more good at Japanese than me?

1912
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,270
I'm just a pilot.

1913
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,170
I'm just a...

1914
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:50,850
I'm just a pilot, okay?

1915
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:54,770
I'm just a pilot, okay?

1916
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:55,430
I can't read it.

1917
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:57,070
The dog walks.

1918
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:00,430
Is he tired?

1919
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:02,890
Is he tired?

1920
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:03,490
Is he hungry?

1921
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:04,050
Is he hungry?

1922
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:07,950
Maybe he becomes tired?

1923
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:13,250
I hate kanji, me too.

1924
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:14,870
I can't read this first one, right?

1925
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,450
This one down here.

1926
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:17,430
I can't read this one.

1927
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:19,690
What is this?

1928
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:19,830
Three?

1929
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:21,370
Wait, what is three?

1930
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,950
Pick number three, my lord.

1931
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:26,690
Pick number three, my lord.

1932
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:30,730
Is the first one trust me?

1933
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:33,870
Wait, this is... Am I reading the kanji wrong?

1934
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:35,430
I can't read kanji at all.

1935
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:37,570
Mmm...

1936
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:41,090
Mmm...

1937
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:41,230
Mmm...

1938
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,810
Even if a dog walks...

1939
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:44,670
The dog...

1940
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:47,930
Mmm...

1941
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:49,610
Mmm... Okay, we're gonna...

1942
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:51,810
We're gonna brute force it.

1943
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:52,170
This one!

1944
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:09,630
I'm going to where I feel comfortable.

1945
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:19,170
I'm going to where I know I'm welcome.

1946
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,210
Japanese not Jozu.

1947
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,210
For real.

1948
01:26:22,530 --> 01:26:23,110
What are they?

1949
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:24,410
Are they like some sort of...

1950
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:26,330
Are they some sort of like...

1951
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:29,350
Let's see...

1952
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:33,310
We are Craft!

1953
01:26:33,490 --> 01:26:34,370
We are craft!

1954
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:38,990
Welcome to the VR craft where you can do VR and play Minecraft!

1955
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:46,070
It's VR and it's Minecraft and they're all together together and we can play VR and we can also play Minecraft!

1956
01:26:53,300 --> 01:27:00,500
Block by block one by one till you shout enough!

1957
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,460
I'm done!

1958
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:05,500
And then you will be blow it up and then you'll start another build.

1959
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,920
It's Minecraft but in VR!

1960
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,720
And we can build a lot!

1961
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:13,380
Um, I actually don't know what this is all about so let's just go in, okay?

1962
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:15,740
Oh!

1963
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:48,860
I don't like you looking at my hunchback like that when I'm running around.

1964
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:50,580
Hold on, I'm going to move over.

1965
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,240
I'm going to move.

1966
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,100
Can I walk next to you?

1967
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:55,840
Can I walk?

1968
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:56,300
Here.

1969
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:57,920
I'll walk next to you.

1970
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:58,480
Okay.

1971
01:27:58,980 --> 01:27:59,480
Here we go.

1972
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:00,840
Wow!

1973
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:02,940
We're in Minecraft!

1974
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,180
Oh my god, wait, hold on.

1975
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,020
This is the perfect moment!

1976
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,440
Oh my god, watch, watch, watch.

1977
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,240
I'm going to say my favorite Minecraft quote, you guys.

1978
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,340
I am Steve!

1979
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:16,920
Steve!

1980
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:24,480
Let's keep going.

1981
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:24,740
Whoa!

1982
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:25,980
I'm building!

1983
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:26,980
Oh my gosh!

1984
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:28,900
I'm building!

1985
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,040
You guys, how high can we go?

1986
01:28:35,490 --> 01:28:36,530
How high can we go?

1987
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,660
How high can we go?

1988
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,020
You can actually build in this Minecraft!

1989
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,840
You can build for real!

1990
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,480
You can build in this Minecraft!

1991
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:53,360
You can build in this Minecraft!

1992
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,180
Wait, what about the void?

1993
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,620
What's like all that over there so high?

1994
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:57,320
What if we fall?

1995
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:02,960
I am Steve.

1996
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:07,440
What happens if we fall?

1997
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:07,760
What happens if we fall?

1998
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:10,920
I'll test this, guys.

1999
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:11,700
I'll test this, guys.

2000
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,460
I won't make you go, okay?

2001
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:15,780
I won't make you go, okay?

2002
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:17,420
This one...

2003
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,100
This one's all me, okay?

2004
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,640
This one's all me.

2005
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,360
I'll take it.

2006
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,240
I'll take the hit, okay?

2007
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:25,840
Hold on, I'm going to move you guys back a little bit.

2008
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,780
Don't think of...

2009
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:28,580
Don't do anything stupid!

2010
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,180
Don't think of coming after me, okay?

2011
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:31,580
Alright?

2012
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,000
Catch you on the flip side.

2013
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:40,420
Oh!

2014
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,840
There's an invisible wall.

2015
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:08,300
Okay, let's keep going in this Minecraft.

2016
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:10,540
You think when it gets dark the mobs will come out?

2017
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:11,460
You think when it gets dark the mobs will come out?

2018
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:12,500
We don't have anything to fight.

2019
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,220
Or fight with.

2020
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:15,920
Nice dance.

2021
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:19,420
And all we have are...

2022
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,480
are just...

2023
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:22,280
dirt blocks.

2024
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:23,980
I can't even mine these trees.

2025
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,040
I can't even mine these trees.

2026
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,320
I can't even mine these trees.

2027
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,200
But you know...

2028
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,060
Can't even chop them.

2029
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,980
Your girl fail energy today is very evident.

2030
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:47,580
What do you...

2031
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,160
What do you mean by that?

2032
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,260
CQC them.

2033
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:53,620
You guys, it's starting to get dark.

2034
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:54,820
Alright.

2035
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,180
This is kind of beautiful though.

2036
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,580
Look at this.

2037
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,240
Minecraft is beautiful.

2038
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,000
Ouch!

2039
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,080
Ouch!

2040
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,260
Watching the sunset.

2041
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:09,640
You and me.

2042
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,760
The moon!

2043
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:12,340
Turn around.

2044
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,720
Turn around right now.

2045
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,240
Turn around.

2046
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:15,620
Turn around.

2047
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:16,300
The moon is out.

2048
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:21,720
Uh oh.

2049
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:22,900
Guys.

2050
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:25,220
We are in trouble.

2051
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:27,660
He isn't right behind me.

2052
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:29,040
Isn't he?

2053
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:03,960
What do you mean by that?

2054
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:05,220
What do you mean by that?

2055
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:06,780
Tsukikakirei.

2056
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:08,600
Look at this place.

2057
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,320
It's basically on fire now.

2058
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,480
Actually, why is it on fire now?

2059
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:14,220
What happened to the moon?

2060
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:20,970
Hmm...

2061
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:22,530
Hmm...

2062
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:23,550
Kermit?

2063
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:25,370
There a bit.

2064
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:29,550
You think that I'm so similar to that other iconic frog?

2065
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:30,270
No.

2066
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:31,970
I get that all the time though.

2067
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:34,730
And I'm actually...

2068
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:37,870
I'm my own person.

2069
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:39,730
My own frog if you will.

2070
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:43,870
Why is the music so dramatic?

2071
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:45,110
Oh you guys it's getting dark.

2072
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:47,050
You guys the mobs are gonna come out.

2073
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:48,570
The mobs are gonna come out.

2074
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:49,830
The mobs.

2075
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:51,110
What do we do?

2076
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:55,030
I should be the only creeper here.

2077
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:00,970
Kiss.

2078
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:02,690
Kiss.

2079
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:04,930
Kiss.

2080
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:06,290
Kiss.

2081
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:08,110
Kiss.

2082
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:09,090
Kiss.

2083
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,160
It's actually...

2084
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,120
It's actually quite bright.

2085
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,220
For it being...

2086
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:38,020
For it being...

2087
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:39,540
Nighttime.

2088
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,020
The moon is so bright.

2089
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,120
I guess there wouldn't be any mobs spawning here.

2090
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:44,400
I guess there wouldn't be any mobs spawning here.

2091
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:45,900
Cause it's so chill.

2092
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,800
Now watch me whip.

2093
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,600

2094
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:56,880
Now watch me whip.

2095
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,220
Whip.

2096
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,060
Whip.

2097
01:33:58,620 --> 01:33:59,780
And nae nae.

2098
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:13,760
Frogbear my beloved.

2099
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:15,280
What I can do that?

2100
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,200
How far can I go?

2101
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:35,110
Ta da!

2102
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:35,250
Yeah!

2103
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:39,630
Oh.

2104
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:40,150
Oh.

2105
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:40,610
Okay.

2106
01:34:40,910 --> 01:34:41,430
Alright.

2107
01:34:41,690 --> 01:34:42,030
Alright.

2108
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:42,370
Hold on.

2109
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:43,190
Wait!

2110
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:44,170
You guys!

2111
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:47,770
I don't think I saved the pilot.

2112
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,420
Oh okay.

2113
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:53,160
I saved the pilot.

2114
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:56,320
Oh thank goodness.

2115
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:02,110
Woo!

2116
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:05,910
I feel way more comfortable in this than anything else.

2117
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:08,230
That's funny.

2118
01:35:08,230 --> 01:35:10,530
I'm born to be a pilot.

2119
01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:13,550
Anyway.

2120
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:16,850
Let's sing something here.

2121
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:19,150
What do you guys want me to sing?

2122
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:20,630
In Minecraft.

2123
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:21,750
Oh my gosh.

2124
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:23,950
I can sing anything that you want in Minecraft.

2125
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:28,310
Sing the danger zone.

2126
01:35:28,350 --> 01:35:28,510
No.

2127
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:32,210
Nothing.

2128
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:33,070
Sorry.

2129
01:35:34,170 --> 01:35:35,050
English songs.

2130
01:35:35,050 --> 01:35:36,810
Because it's the only thing that I have right now.

2131
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:42,430
Enderman's coming to get you.

2132
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:43,030
No he's not.

2133
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:45,730
Uh uh.

2134
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:49,810
Uh.

2135
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:52,330
Hmm.

2136
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:54,450
Hmm.

2137
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:57,730
Snake eaters for later.

2138
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:02,550
California girls?

2139
01:36:02,610 --> 01:36:03,730
Great idea!

2140
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:05,370
That's an excellent idea.

2141
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:09,560
Dang it.

2142
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:17,280
Okay hold on.

2143
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:17,900
I gotta type it.

2144
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:19,460
Where's my computer?

2145
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:20,500
There it is.

2146
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,460
I think I spelled California wrong.

2147
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,140
California girls.

2148
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,020

01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:42,760
Oh here it is.

2150
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:45,580
Oh let me turn off Minecraft music.

2151
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:47,320
Ah!

2152
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,440
I know a place.

2153
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:02,640
Where the grass is really greener.

2154
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:05,340
Where the grass is really greener.

2155
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,760
Wet and wild.

2156
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:10,100
There must be something in the water.

2157
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:10,840
There must be something in the water.

2158
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:12,980
Slipping.

2159
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:14,300
Gin and juice.

2160
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:17,920
Oh it's better than the palm trees.

2161
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:19,340

Try to keep a little sneak peek.

2165
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:26,100
Try to keep a little sneak peek.

2166
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,830
You could travel the world.

2167
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,740
But nothing comes close to the golden coast.

2168
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,540

2256
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:00,900
That was a good adventure, wasn't it?

2257
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:03,480
Let's go to another world.

2258
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,560
Where shall we go?

2259
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,440
Oh wait, hold on.

2260
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,280
Let me turn the music back.

2261
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:14,030
Yay!

2262
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:15,310
Thank you.

2263
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:16,810
Thank you.

2264
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:17,590
Thank you.

2265
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:19,510
Thank you.

2266
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:20,470
Did you like the dance?

2267
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:21,330
I forgot that.

2268
01:41:21,390 --> 01:41:22,310
Okay, it was like...

2269
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:23,570
This.

2270
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:25,190
This.

2271
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:26,870
This.

2272
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,710
This.

2273
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:30,650
And then this.

2274
01:41:32,990 --> 01:41:33,470
This?

2275
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:35,150
I'm running into stuff in my room?

2276
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:37,050
Nice job with the Mutsuki dance.

2277
01:41:39,150 --> 01:41:39,830
Thank you.

2278
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:43,950
Okay.

2279
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:52,330
I have some other ones on here, but let me see how long we are.

2280
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:56,390
With streaming?

2281
01:41:58,290 --> 01:41:58,770
Okay.

2282
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:01,650
I think just one more world, you guys.

2283
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:03,730
Let's go to a museum.

2284
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:05,290
It belongs in a museum.

2285
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:09,430
I have maybe this one.

2286
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:15,360
Let's see how it is.

2287
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:16,760
Actually, hold on.

2288
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:17,220
Let me...

2289
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:19,120
Do some stuff first.

2290
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,260
Here we go.

2291
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,460
Here we go.

2292
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:26,940
Here we go.

2293
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,140
California

2294
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:36,940
girls.

2295
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:39,140
California.

2296
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:40,180
California boy?

2297
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:43,810
California...

2298
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:44,290
California girl?

2299
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:46,910
Like let's do the one in Vegas?

2300
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:49,850
It's a Grozny grad who wants to go there so they...

2301
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:51,750
I'm taking you to the best part of MGS3.

2302
01:42:54,050 --> 01:42:56,450
Welcome to Snakes and Lion...

2303
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:56,630
Oh!

2304
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:56,950
Oh!

2305
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:01,740
That scared me.

2306
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:06,080
Oh my god, that scared me.

2307
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:08,620
So much.

2308
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:10,180
Guys.

2309
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:11,420
Guys.

2310
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:12,920
Oh my god.

2311
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:16,520
It's explaining to you how to do it.

2312
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,020
Oh my god.

2313
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,200
Oh my god, it scared me.

2314
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:25,920
Welcome everybody to, yes, the ladder!

2315
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:30,160
The infamous... well, maybe not infamous.

2316
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,060
Reach the top before the song ends.

2317
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,280
Timer will begin automatically.

2318
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,340
Rewards stay if you reach the... wait, there's rewards?

2319
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,180
What rewards are we talking about?

2320
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,940
Reach behind your ears to grab the climbing orbs.

2321
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:43,700
Place the orb to the ladder.

2322
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:48,120
Hold the use button to grab the ladder and pull yourself up.

2323
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:50,780
When dropped, the climbing orbs will return to the back of your head.

2324
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:55,550
Are you guys ready?

2325
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:59,390
Are you guys ready to climb the ladder?

2326
01:44:00,030 --> 01:44:01,050
Climb the ladder!

2327
01:44:01,570 --> 01:44:01,930
Climb!

2328
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:05,430
So I grab it from my ears and then I place the orb on the...

2329
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,590
Oh!

2330
01:44:05,770 --> 01:44:06,610
I have one!

2331
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:08,150
Oh, I have him!

2332
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:10,870
And then I place the orb to a ladder.

2333
01:44:10,990 --> 01:44:13,010
Then I use the... hold the use button.

2334
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:17,750
Oh gosh, this is, I feel like, gonna be a bit of a mess.

2335
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:19,530
Okay.

2336
01:44:19,530 --> 01:44:22,930
And then we hold the use button to grab the ladder and pull yourself up.

2337
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,110
Hold the use button.

2338
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:25,930
What's the use button?

2339
01:44:26,070 --> 01:44:26,910
Oh, the triggers!

2340
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:27,710
The triggers.

2341
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:28,210
Okay, okay.

2342
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:29,670
Test run?

2343
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:31,270
Yeah, this is... let's do a test run.

2344
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:33,350
Especially because I want... I don't know how the camera will be.

2345
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:36,430
I want to make sure that you guys are able to see and everything, so...

2346
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:36,830
Wow!

2347
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:40,970
I just noticed, like, the reflection in this thing is pretty good!

2348
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:43,350
It looks real, right?

2349
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:43,870
Wow.

2350
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:45,230
It looks so good.

2351
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:46,530
Alright, guys.

2352
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:50,770
Test run.

2353
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:51,310
Test run.

2354
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:51,470
Test run.

2355
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:03,550
Okay, hold on.

2356
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:04,870
I'm stuck.

2357
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:07,950
I'm stuck.

2358
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:08,790
Guys?

2359
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:10,490
Guys?

2360
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:14,730
Guys?

2361
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:18,980
Guys?

2362
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:21,600
I can't move.

2363
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:22,980
Guys, I'm stuck.

2364
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:24,360
Guys?

2365
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:26,620
Guys, I'm stuck.

2366
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:29,020
Guys, can you see?

2367
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:29,680
You can't see my...

2368
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,200
You guys, I'm stuck on the ladder!

2369
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,180
You guys, help me.

2370
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:35,400
You can just see my fingers.

2371
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:37,020
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2372
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:39,760
What a thrill.

2373
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,500
Why are they all the way over there now?

2374
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:44,440
What a thrill.

2375
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:50,910
With darkness and...

2376
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:51,770
Oh.

2377
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:53,030
Oh, gosh.

2378
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:56,430
I'm gonna restart the world.

2379
01:45:56,590 --> 01:45:56,990
Respawn.

2380
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:59,410
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2381
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:01,750
Gosh, that thing scared me again!

2382
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:04,170
Okay, place... grab them.

2383
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:05,630
Grabby grab.

2384
01:46:06,570 --> 01:46:07,210
Grabby grab.

2385
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:08,710
And then...

2386
01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:10,670
One...

2387
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:11,930
Two...

2388
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:13,090
Three...

2389
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:14,270
Four...

2390
01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:16,810
But don't actually open your hands, I think.

2391
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:21,350
This is a... this is a...

2392
01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:22,590
One...

2393
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:23,690
Two...

2394
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:25,110
Three...

2395
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:28,810
Let's see.

2396
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:30,030
Place the orb to the ladder.

2397
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:30,990
Use the hold button to grab...

2398
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:33,170
Okay, I think I'm just gonna hold the hold button.

2399
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:35,610
I think I'm just gonna hold it the whole time.

2400
01:46:36,270 --> 01:46:36,590
Okay.

2401
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:38,090
Yeah, don't let the balls go.

2402
01:46:38,210 --> 01:46:38,870
Don't let the balls go.

2403
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:39,990
Okay, here we go.

2404
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:42,770
Um, I'm gonna also move you guys.

2405
01:46:45,290 --> 01:46:45,930
Like this.

2406
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:47,670
A little bit.

2407
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:49,350
Oh, uh, hold on.

2408
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,600
You're gonna see my butt the whole way.

2409
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:01,260
Maybe that'll do.

2410
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,060
Are you guys two sideways?

2411
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:04,840
There we go.

2412
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:06,900
Oh.

2413
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,640
Wait, no, no, no, no.

2414
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:10,300
Okay.

2415
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:11,520
Why am I so shaky?

2416
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:14,100
Dang it, I messed it up.

2417
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:14,860
Sorry, guys.

2418
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:16,800
Okay.

2419
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:23,720
Okay.

2420
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:26,200
Why am I... Why am I shaking?

2421
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:26,760
What's wrong?

2422
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:29,540
Okay.

2423
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,460
Yeah, I'm vibrating for some reason.

2424
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:32,880
Um...

2425
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,060
Why am I vibrating?

2426
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,220
Why am I vibrating?

2427
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:39,900
Why am I vibrating?

2428
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:41,380
I got them.

2429
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:42,820
Oh, wait, hold on.

2430
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:44,820
I'm also gonna move chat over.

2431
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,400
And I'm gonna move this over, the thing.

2432
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:47,800
Okay.

2433
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:50,320
I think now I'm properly ready.

2434
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:02,220
I'm doing it!

2435
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:06,160
When's the song start?

2436
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:08,140
Oh!

2437
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:15,680
With the darkness and silence through the night.

2438
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,180
What a thrill.

2439
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:27,580
I'm searching and I'm melting to you.

2440
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,980
What a fear.

2441
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:39,750
But you're so supreme.

2442
01:48:46,190 --> 01:48:50,630
Not for honor, but for you.

2443
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:53,830
The music is quiet.

2444
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:56,650
It's not me, though.

2445
01:48:56,690 --> 01:48:57,290
It's the world.

2446
01:48:57,670 --> 01:48:58,710
Oh, I can turn it up here.

2447
01:48:58,910 --> 01:49:00,610
There you go.

2448
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:07,990
Holy!

2449
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:12,150
It said it would restart automatically.

2450
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:13,830
But it did not.

2451
01:49:15,970 --> 01:49:16,490
Restart!

2452
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:17,030
Restart!

2453
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:20,070
I'm also gonna change the angle for you guys.

2454
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:25,050
I'm also gonna change the angle for you guys.

2455
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:28,540
Hold on.

2456
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:29,280
I'm gonna change the angle.

2457
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:32,660
Maybe like that's better.

2458
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:37,660
There you go.

2459
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:38,300
Now you can see.

2460
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,100
Reset.

2461
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:47,580
Reset challenge.

2462
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:48,000
Okay.

2463
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:48,920
All right.

2464
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:51,080
I know you guys can't see me super well.

2465
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:53,120
But I think it's better if you guys see how far...

2466
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:53,700
How much far...

2467
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:54,760
Oh, no!

2468
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,920
The restart button on your right to try again.

2469
01:49:58,800 --> 01:49:59,920
What's holding around, Snake?

2470
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:02,100
Who's this?

2471
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:03,440
The mission failed at the top!

2472
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:07,600
Oh, I think it gives you a chance to restart if you want.

2473
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,040
Oh, okay.

2474
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:09,300
Okay.

2475
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:09,480
Okay.

2476
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:10,140
All right.

2477
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:11,220
It gives you a chance to restart.

2478
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:11,860
It's kind of nice.

2479
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:12,680
All right.

2480
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:13,260
Here we go, guys.

2481
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:18,500
Okay.

2482
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:19,340
Don't miss the...

2483
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:27,580
Properly grab it.

2484
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,300
Properly grab it.

2485
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:37,880
All right.

2486
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:44,750
There we go.

2487
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:45,530
All right.

2488
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:45,950
Okay.

2489
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:47,750
Let's try again.

2490
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:52,070
Oh, there it goes.

2491
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:52,170
Oh, there it goes again.

2492
01:50:52,170 --> 01:50:52,190
There.

2493
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:52,310
Okay.

2494
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:53,890
All right.

2495
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:54,410
All right.

2496
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:55,450
Here we go.

2497
01:50:55,890 --> 01:50:56,270
There you go.

2498
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:01,960
Yeah.

2499
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:02,700
Yeah.

2500
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,340
Okay.

2501
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:20,020
How much further do we have?

2502
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:21,140
Oh my gosh.

2503
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:26,900
I gotta go faster.

2504
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:34,940
I gotta go faster.

2505
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,100
I gotta go faster.

2506
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:37,720
I gotta go faster.

2507
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:37,920
I gotta go faster.

2508
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:38,200
Oh my gosh.

2509
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:39,620
This is actually such a workout.

2510
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:41,140
I am still...

2511
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,700
No, I'm not gonna make it!

2512
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,400
I'm not gonna make it!

2513
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:49,140
No!

2514
01:51:54,860 --> 01:51:56,540
I can't do the next part!

2515
01:51:57,060 --> 01:51:57,580
No!

2516
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,040
No!

2517
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:13,310
What's

2518
01:52:21,590 --> 01:52:22,470
rolling around Snake?

2519
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:25,930
Holy moly.

2520
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:30,270
Oh my gosh.

2521
01:52:30,270 --> 01:52:30,530
Oh my god.

2522
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:36,630
Was the camera angle okay, or was the camera angle okay?

2523
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:40,010
You would've made it.

2524
01:52:40,110 --> 01:52:40,850
I don't think I would've.

2525
01:52:46,730 --> 01:52:47,490
Yeah, that was good?

2526
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:47,790
Okay.

2527
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:54,550
My arms, though.

2528
01:52:55,110 --> 01:52:56,090
Oh my gosh.

2529
01:52:57,710 --> 01:53:00,050
Snake must be sprinting up that ladder, right?

2530
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:03,130
Okay, Magic Doodoo Johnson.

2531
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:04,650
I want to see you do this, huh?

2532
01:53:05,850 --> 01:53:14,970
And also gripping onto your controllers at the same time and making sure that you firmly grasp the next one.

2533
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:16,090
Yeah, whatever.

2534
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:17,310
Yeah, whatever.

2535
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:27,110
I'll call you Magic Doodoo Stupid Comment Johnson.

2536
01:53:27,330 --> 01:53:28,570
That's what you are.

2537
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:29,190
Okay.

2538
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:34,290
Firmly grasp it.

2539
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:39,950
That's what was my biggest concern was if I was going to grab it well enough.

2540
01:53:40,210 --> 01:53:42,210
Wait, the camera angle is not good at all, you guys.

2541
01:53:42,270 --> 01:53:43,090
You can't see my hand.

2542
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:44,770
Hold on, let me try again.

2543
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:47,830
You guys can't see me grasping it.

2544
01:53:50,150 --> 01:53:51,810
You guys can't see me grasping it.

2545
01:53:51,870 --> 01:53:58,530
And by me, by grasping, I mean my ladder.

2546
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:02,680
Maybe like that.

2547
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:05,960
Nah, I descend.

2548
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:07,300
What the hell?

2549
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:13,400
If you imagine the perspective is horizontal, it's like a worm crawling on a railroad track.

2550
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:18,420
Okay.

2551
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:20,260
All right.

2552
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:21,780
Let's see if this is better now.

2553
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,560
Wait, you guys still can't see?

2554
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,060
Hold on.

2555
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:26,420
Sorry.

2556
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:27,620
I want it to be good angle.

2557
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:28,920
I want it to be a good angle for real.

2558
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:31,860
Yeah.

2559
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:38,180
I want you guys to see how much we got going on left.

2560
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:40,300
I can't see my arm at all.

2561
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:41,080
Where's the thrill?

2562
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:49,780
I don't think we can have best of both worlds, everybody.

2563
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:52,440
I think it's one or the other.

2564
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:56,000
I think it's either you see my arms, which you can't even see here.

2565
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,280
Or you see the top.

2566
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:03,340
Okay.

2567
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:10,840
Hmm.

2568
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:14,620
Put the camera behind your butt.

2569
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:17,100
When you put the camera on your chest, point it up.

2570
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:17,840
Oh, that's a good idea.

2571
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:20,000
Way better than Nano's idea.

2572
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:25,320
Do I like that?

2573
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:31,640
Oh my gosh, this is such a good idea.

2574
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:32,520
Body cam, real.

2575
01:55:36,330 --> 01:55:37,090
Why is it green?

2576
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:37,690
Oh, that's me.

2577
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:43,330
That's my head.

2578
01:55:46,330 --> 01:55:48,310
Real GoPro footage, everybody.

2579
01:55:48,590 --> 01:55:49,110
Hello.

2580
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:53,860
Okay.

2581
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:55,260
Okay.

2582
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,200
Here we go.

2583
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:36,940
Oh, no!

2584
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:41,670
No!

2585
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:45,650
This is why I was worried about going so fast.

2586
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:12,200
So I just mean to say, this is kind of weird.

2587
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:12,380
Sometimes you just can't see anything.

2588
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:12,420
The camera runs out of battery, or the camera is out of AA battery.

2589
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:17,200
It's not in criticize me.

2590
01:57:35,850 --> 01:57:36,510
Oh, fuck!

2591
01:57:36,570 --> 01:57:36,710
Ah!

2592
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:37,270
No!

2593
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:38,170
Oh my god!

2594
01:57:45,450 --> 01:57:46,850
I fell onto the ladder.

2595
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:47,730
No!

2596
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:53,090
You guys!

2597
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:53,510
You guys!

2598
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:54,070
You guys!

2599
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:54,650
You guys!

2600
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:06,000
I never failed if you... can't get me!

2601
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:07,500
Snake!

2602
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:14,400
There's darkness through here.

2603
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:17,720
Aw, man!

2604
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:20,940
Aw, man!

2605
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:28,500
You're too short to make good progress.

2606
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:31,960
This is... this is... this is... this is height disadvantage!

2607
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:35,360
This is... I should have a height handicap.

2608
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:39,300
Long strokes were a good idea, though.

2609
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:40,860
Can we not call them long strokes?

2610
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:45,880
Grab the sides of the ladder.

2611
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:47,380
Can you do that?

2612
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,800
They're really wide, though.

2613
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,100
Oh, shit!

2614
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:51,540
You can!

2615
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:53,940
Wait, it's too difficult.

2616
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:54,680
I think it's too difficult.

2617
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,300
I'm going for it!

2618
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:06,800
I'm going for it!

2619
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:12,980
Maybe I should stand on a chair while I...

2620
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:13,200
Ow!

2621
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:13,520
No!

2622
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:14,060
No, no, no, no!

2623
01:59:24,230 --> 01:59:24,550
Heart...

2624
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:27,570
No, I can't sing the song or else I'll get distracted.

2625
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:28,850
I have to concentrate.

2626
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:30,830
I have to concentrate!

2627
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:33,690
Oh my gosh.

2628
01:59:33,690 --> 01:59:35,390
I give my love a

2629
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:58,120
round of applause No!

2630
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:03,920
It's the way I fly to you

2631
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:12,600
I'm still in a dream Please!

2632
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:14,720
Please!

2633
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:16,220
Please!

2634
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:25,510
How do I...

2635
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:29,030
How do I... How do I...

2636
02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:30,650
How do I go up?

2637
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:31,810
Please!

2638
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:33,290
How do I get up?

2639
02:00:33,410 --> 02:00:34,510
I'm stuck, you guys!

2640
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:34,930
I'm stuck!

2641
02:00:45,230 --> 02:00:46,250
There it is.

2642
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:47,330
Okay, hold on.

2643
02:00:47,470 --> 02:00:48,070
Give me a second.

2644
02:00:48,110 --> 02:00:49,210
I'll make you guys normal again.

2645
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:59,380
My hands are shaking from gripping so hard.

2646
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:01,560
Yeah, we did it, baby!

2647
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:04,340
I'm basically Snake!

2648
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:06,780
I'm basically Snake!

2649
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:11,320
Yeah!

2650
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:16,760
Ouch.

2651
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,300
Oh, my fingers.

2652
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,820
Oh, my fingers hurt.

2653
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:23,500
You did it!

2654
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:25,340
Thank you for climbing this really long ladder.

2655
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:28,340
Be sure to check out the worlds through the door to your right.

2656
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:30,200
For real adventure worlds.

2657
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:34,160
Okay, what is this?

2658
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:37,460
Kept you waiting, huh?

2659
02:01:41,580 --> 02:01:42,140
Oh!

2660
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:43,260
I'm the box!

2661
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:46,860
I'm the box!

2662
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:48,300
I...

2663
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:58,450
I can't see anything.

2664
02:01:58,630 --> 02:01:59,170
Am I...

2665
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:03,250
A multi-box drifting!

2666
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:11,360
Hold on.

2667
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:12,040
Let me save this.

2668
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,080
So, I don't lose it, favorite it.

2669
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:14,680
It's my...

2670
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:15,800
It's my...

2671
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:18,220
It's my... It's my reward.

2672
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:22,060
It's my reward for having, you know... It's my trophy.

2673
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:24,800
It's my trophy.

2674
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:26,040
I have to have it.

2675
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,620
I'll give you the title of big box.

2676
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:32,560
What else is here?

2677
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:33,100
What's this?

2678
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:33,980
Toggle mirror?

2679
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:36,600
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

2680
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:40,560
The sound effects scared me.

2681
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,400
Well guys, this was a lot of fun.

2682
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:46,900
I hope you guys had fun too.

2683
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:48,060
Big box.

2684
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,820
I can't even like grasp anything anymore.

2685
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:53,040
Holy cow.

2686
02:02:55,820 --> 02:02:59,820
Oh, should I sing another song before I go?

2687
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:00,680
One last song?

2688
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:04,160
What song should I sing?

2689
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:05,720
One last song?

2690
02:03:05,820 --> 02:03:06,720
Doesn't have to be Metal Gear.

2691
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:07,380
It can be anything.

2692
02:03:08,780 --> 02:03:09,700
It can be anything.

2693
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:12,820
One last song?

2694
02:03:12,980 --> 02:03:13,440
One last song?

2695
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:18,600
Snake Eater.

2696
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:20,840
We just listened to Snake Eater like three times.

2697
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:25,480
September?

2698
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:30,640
Oh man, I think I have to.

2699
02:03:32,060 --> 02:03:34,440
I think I have to.

2700
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:36,800
I think I have to sing September.

2701
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:38,620
Oh golly.

2702
02:03:38,980 --> 02:03:40,300
You guys aren't sick of that song?

2703
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:47,200
I don't think I would even know that song if it wasn't for GGStream.

2704
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:48,940
Okay, give me a second.

2705
02:03:49,060 --> 02:03:50,620
Let me pop up the thing.

2706
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:54,940
And let me also turn off the ambiance here.

2707
02:04:01,620 --> 02:04:02,960
Oh, let me type it.

2708
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:14,980
Yeah, September's almost over so we gotta sing it before it's over, right?

2709
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:18,000
Gotta sing it before it's over.

2710
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:19,940
Do you remember?

2711
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:27,160
Why does it keep getting small?

2712
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:37,040
Da!

2713
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,420
Do you remember?

2714
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,840
The 21st night of September?

2715
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:49,360
Love was changing the minds of pretenders.

2716
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:49,680
No!

2717
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:52,600
The window just may got small again.

2718
02:04:55,240 --> 02:05:00,380
Our hearts were ringing in the key that our souls were singing.

2719
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:07,860
As we danced in the night, remember how the stars stole the night away.

2720
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:15,220
Ya ni da, say that you remember.

2721
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:18,680
Ba ni da, dancing in September.

2722
02:05:19,330 --> 02:05:22,580
Ba ni da, never was a clue.

2723
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:23,380
La di da.

2724
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:29,100
Ba di da, ba di da.

2725
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:30,960
Ba di da, da di da.

2726
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:32,880
Ba di da, ba di da.

2727
02:05:32,920 --> 02:05:34,680
Ba di da, ba di da.

2728
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,520
Ba di da, ba di da.

2729
02:05:36,660 --> 02:05:37,740
Ba di da.

2730
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:40,440
Hey, hey, hey!

2731
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:42,860
My thoughts are with you.

2732
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:46,560
Holding hands with your heart to see you.

2733
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:49,020
Only blue talking love.

2734
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:50,100
Remember.

2735
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:52,140
How we knew.

2736
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:53,920
Love was here to stay.

2737
02:05:56,980 --> 02:05:57,840
Now December.

2738
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:01,300
Found the love we shared in September.

2739
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:05,420
Only oh ba da ba da ba ba.

2740
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:07,580
Sorry I'm having such technical difficulties today.

2741
02:06:08,220 --> 02:06:08,980
Today.

2742
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:12,360
Hey, hey!

2743
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:13,800
Ba di da.

2744
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:15,940
Say that you remember.

2745
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:17,600
Ba di da.

2746
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:19,700
Dancing in September.

2747
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:21,400
Ba di da.

2748
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:24,360
Never was a cloudy day.

2749
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:28,940
And we said ba di da.

2750
02:06:29,340 --> 02:06:30,860
Start to remember.

2751
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,760
Ba di da.

2752
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:34,840
Dancing in September.

2753
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:36,540
Ba di da.

2754
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:39,820
Golden dreams were shiny days.

2755
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,460
Those bells were ringing.

2756
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:49,320
Our souls were singing.

2757
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:52,180
Do you remember?

2758
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:54,740
Every cloudy day.

2759
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:59,360
And we said ba di da.

2760
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:01,720
Say that you remember.

2761
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:03,180
Ba di da.

2762
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,300
Dancing in September.

2763
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:06,960
Ba di da.

2764
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:09,960
Never was a cloudy day.

2765
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:16,480
Da di da.

2766
02:07:42,990 --> 02:07:44,530
Ba di da.

2767
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:45,790
We doubt it all.

2768
02:08:02,070 --> 02:08:03,450
I was ready to go.

2769
02:08:03,810 --> 02:08:05,130
I was ready to go again.

2770
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:05,970
Yeah!

2771
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:07,490
Thank you guys!

2772
02:08:09,610 --> 02:08:11,430
Thank you for being our chat today.

2773
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:13,010
I'll see you when I get back.

2774
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:13,510
When I get back?

2775
02:08:14,010 --> 02:08:14,810
It's my birthday!

2776
02:08:15,590 --> 02:08:16,350
It's my birthday?

2777
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:18,730
My birthday is the first.

2778
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:21,990
The first, but we're celebrating on the second.

2779
02:08:23,410 --> 02:08:23,850
Sec...

2780
02:08:26,210 --> 02:08:26,790
Stop it.

2781
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:27,870
The second?

2782
02:08:30,570 --> 02:08:31,950
And I have a big announcement.

2783
02:08:32,630 --> 02:08:33,750
Big, big, big announcement.

2784
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:36,550
So please, come and watch.

2785
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:39,750
And then, you know, you'll see what the announcement is.

2786
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:41,390
Have fun at TGS.

2787
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:41,990
Thank you!

2788
02:08:42,410 --> 02:08:43,110
Thank you, thank you!

2789
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:45,530
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2790
02:08:45,870 --> 02:08:46,730
Oh, there you go.

2791
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:47,230
Now I can say it.

2792
02:08:47,270 --> 02:08:48,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2793
02:08:49,410 --> 02:08:49,730
Yeah.

2794
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:51,710
Wake me up when September ends.

2795
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:54,850
And like, by the time I'm back, it's gone.

2796
02:08:54,990 --> 02:08:56,830
By the time I'm back, September's over.

2797
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:57,810
So, you know what?

2798
02:08:57,850 --> 02:08:58,650
I will wake you up.

2799
02:08:58,930 --> 02:09:00,690
Wake you up in time for my birthday.

2800
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:01,990
Bye-bye, everybody!

2801
02:09:02,590 --> 02:09:03,850
See you in like a week.

2802
02:09:04,230 --> 02:09:04,830
Bye-bye!

2803
02:09:05,630 --> 02:09:07,270
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.

2804
02:09:07,550 --> 02:09:10,410
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.

2805
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:14,170
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye!

2806
02:09:15,050 --> 02:09:15,410

2807
02:09:15,830 --> 02:09:16,190
Bye!

2808
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:17,950
