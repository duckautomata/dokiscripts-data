00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,600
Hello,

2
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,640
hello, hello, I was just about to say about the...

3
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,640
About the... Josh show, but...

4
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,440
I was told that it's sold out already.

5
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,540
There will be more tickets tomorrow.

6
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,680
for the people that did not that did not do the pre-sale

7
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:09,880
to be fair it's a very very small venue and and and and
there are streaming tickets so if you wanted to go to if you

8
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,800
wanted to watch the jazz just 3D live, then those are
options too!

9
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,000
Hopefully!

10
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,880
Yeah, it's very, very, very, very small.

11
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,840
I apologize, it's kind of...

12
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,660
But also, I was not quite sure how well tickets would go
Because it's not like a typical idol show.

13
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,340
But, uh...

14
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,200
Thank you!

15
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,940
Oh, Super Chats are still off.

16
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,500
I forgot.

17
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,720
Wait, let me see.

18
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,460
We can turn the back on.

19
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,000
I forgot about it.

20
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,610
Okay, this should be good, though.

21
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,420
But thank

22
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,440
you!

23
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,400
Thank you!

24
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,440
If you could not get a ticket, I'm so sorry!

25
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,980
Hopefully I can do another one in the future.

26
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,020
I mean, if this one...

27
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,740
Has the...

28
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,260
Has the...

29
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,720
Oh, wait.

30
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,300
One second.

31
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,560
Sorry, I'm getting pinged about things.

32
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,520
Oh.

33
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,740
How do you get the one?

34
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:15,880
I didn't have a new year's dream but I had a dream today you
apparently bought a 70k yen fuamoko suitcase 70k yen how

35
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:26,900
much is that like 7,000 dollars or something well I guess a
little less depending on the yen wait 70k seven how How many

36
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,780
numbers is that?

37
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,600
Seven?

38
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,800
Seven?

39
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,300
Seven?

40
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:34,940
Zero?

41
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,340
Zero?

42
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,000
Zero?

43
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,180
Bore?

44
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,760
Wait.

45
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,760
How many zeros is it?

46
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,720
How many zeros is it?

47
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,400
I'm off by a zero.

48
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,680
Oh, it's like a...

49
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,020
Oh!

50
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,220
It's like...

51
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,880
Actually, I feel like that's a...

52
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,300
That seems like I'm kind of...

53
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:09,820
normal price for that like a suitcase that is that is a
themed like that finally hot dogs it would be like 500 usd

54
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,620

00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:59,060
congrats on your concert selling out in two minutes mint i
don't think it will sell out phantom i didn't know because

59
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,880
it's not like a regular concert.

60
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,800
It's jazz.

61
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,360
Not everybody likes jazz.

62
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,980
Not everybody likes jazz.

63
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,160
Not everybody's going to want to go.

64
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
Wow, thank you so much for the walk.

65
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,580
I was unable to send one last stream, but how many do you
hear me?

66
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,200
Don't appreciate it.

67
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,980
All that you do and everything you will do.

68
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,180
This coming year.

69
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,920
Thank you.

70
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,060
Jeff, congrats on getting a ticket.

71
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,800
Thank you.

72
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,240
Okay, I'll see you though.

73
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,240
Thank you.

74
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
Thank you, thank you.

75
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
But everyone likes you, Minto.

76
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,300
That's not true.

77
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,360
That's not true.

78
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,320
That's impossible.

79
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,840
It's impossible for everybody to like somebody.

80
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,440
Wait, for everybody to like one person.

81
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,900
For one shot.

82
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,560
Reason to stay up to 1 a.m.

83
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,580
No, go to sleep.

84
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,060
The VOD will be there.

85
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,480
The VOD will be there.

86
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,800
You like jazz.

87
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,080
It's going to be an extremely jazzy show.

88
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,960
I think I finalized songs yesterday even.

89
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,160
yeah.

90
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,900
We'll try to get jazz tickets tomorrow.

91
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,100
Good luck.

92
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,560
I like jazz, but Wheelie Jack will always be my favorite.

93
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,400
This is a transform.

94
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,160
Warmer's joke.

95
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,540
Shut up, me.

96
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,500
Happy New Year!

97
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,660
Extreme jazz, gold!

98
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,660
So...

99
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,240
Ryan, Ryan,

100
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,110
Spent the past two years being a lurker, so one of my New
Year's resolutions is be more active in chat!

101
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,910
Also getting more hours, so I might have to be Vodgang for a
couple of streams.

102
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,930
More hours?

103
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,310
Sounds good though.

104
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,050
That's...

105
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,450
You...

106
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:07,990
You...

107
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,050
You...

108
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,630
Bake that bread!

109
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,270
Thank you though!

110
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,270
Thank you!

111
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,040
Thank you everybody.

112
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,320
Lurker turned chatter.

113
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,760
Wow!

114
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,000
Bake that bread.

115
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,300
Bake it.

116
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,520
I hope it's cinnamon raisin bread.

117
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,500
Oh yeah.

118
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,520
That sounds like the goods.

119
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Cinnamon raisin bread.

120
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,320
bread.

121
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,880
I want some right now.

122
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,840
Can't stick around.

123
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
I'm not doing well.

124
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:46,860
Brandon!

125
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,460
No!

126
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,200
Please.

127
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,600
Please feel better.

128
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,400
Are there any chances of online merch for the jazz show?

129
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,120
Jazz concert?

130
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,880
Um, I believe so.

131
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
I believe so.

132
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,660
The sentinel will be putting it up, but I will double check.

133
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,700
Managed to get a GA ticket.

134
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,780
Thank you!

135
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,680
Thank you so much!

136
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,000
What are the Aibu's favorite mainstreams of 2025?

137
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,240
Mine include Dredge?

138
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,560
Metal Gear?

139
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,020
Nancy Drew?

140
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,640
Mystery of the Druids?

141
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,400
Thank goodness you're here in the legendary jazz karaoke.

142
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,320
Yeah!

143
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,700
I...

144
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,040
For the jazz show even.

145
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,960
Some songs that I sung before in jazz karaoke will be sung
again and some new songs as well.

146
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,760
So...

147
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,540
Yes, yes, yes.

148
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:43,720
Journey.

149
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,700
Nancy Drew's in the public domain now apparently.

150
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,560
What?

151
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,420
Nancy Drew is that old?

152
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,780
The Nancy Drew's dreams were great.

153
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,220
Maybe I should play another one.

154
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,920
It was so funny though.

155
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,620
Brace for Nancy Drew horror media.

156
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,980
But, like, it's kind of already set up for that, no?

157
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,460
I mean, it's just like a Scooby-Doo.

158
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,830
Guys, I was thinking.

159
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,910
I played this game.

160
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,390
How did I move around?

161
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,670
How?

162
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,650
How did I move?

163
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,310
How did I walk around?

164
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,730
Did I use my regular keyboard?

165
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,870
How did I do that?

166
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,210
Controller!

167
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,450
I had to plug in my controller.

168
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,020
I had to plug in my controller.

169
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,090
Greetings from Holland!

170
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,550

Thanks to you.

175
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,130
Like a little Jiminy cricket pushing me on.

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,890
I mean, maybe you get the adrenaline.

189
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,150
Adrenaline.

190
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,110
Adrenaline.

191
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,370
Adrenaline.

192
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,770
Wait, now I can't say it properly.

193
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,530
Adrenaline.

194
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:42,690
Adrenaline.

195
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,050
Adrenaline.

196
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:43,970
Adrenaline.

197
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,630
Couple.

198
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,490
Yeah, there will still be something more tomorrow.

199
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,930
I will be honest.

200
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,250
It's a very, very small amount tomorrow.

201
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,070
But there was also the streaming tickets though.

202
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,090
Adrenaline.

203
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,210
Why was I saying that word?

204
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:09,710
Wait.

205
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,770
Why was I saying the...

206
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,130
The rush.

207
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,590
Of a ticket.

208
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,850
When you get tickets for a show, Yeah.

209
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,690
Because I had a I had the rush for the tickets.

210
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,230
Yeah, but I had something I wanted to say.

211
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,910
Oh, man.

212
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,670
I had something I wanted to say.

213
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,130
I had something that I wanted to do declare.

214
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,050
Happy New Year, Mito!

215
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,250
Hoping!

216
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,110
This new year, I can be less Vodgang and more proud.

217
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,470
present.

218
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,030
Oh, Glister.

219
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,250
Oh, he's in any form by your side.

220
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,070
Thank you.

221
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,370
Congrats for the sold-out.

222
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,090
Jazzy Minky love you so much.

223
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:10,730
Love you!

224
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:15,010
I do declare that I don't like it.

225
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:24,570
But then at the same time, for like lottery stuff, I know
it's technically more fair, but at the same time, I'm always

226
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,870
like I feel like I'm like, my luck is so bad.

227
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,690
I've never felt confident in a lottery.

228
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,810
This is What was that Saul Goodman world, Minto?

229
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,090
Was it your hubby's face?

230
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,160
So let's talk about the New Year's.

231
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,660
Oh, happy new year, everybody.

232
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,580
I haven't seen you since last year.

233
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,140
I bet you haven't heard that joke before ever.

234
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,560
I haven't seen you since last year.

235
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,900
And...

236
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,140
New mirror, minto.

237
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,060
Thank you, Fokura.

238
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,960
Can I recommend you three songs?

239
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,620
Oh, thank you.

240
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,760
Check them out.

241
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,580
Wow, so clever.

242
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,840
You could say I'm the entertainer of all time.

243
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,300
If you have not watched the 3D sloppy...

244
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,680
3D, the VR chat.

245
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,120
It's technically 3D, but VR chat.

246
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,180
Sloppy Sisters collab on Doki Bird Channel.

247
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,480
Lithuania!

248
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,720
This is my first time watching a live stream.

249
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,440
Welcome!

250
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,020
Wait, why are we having so many people from, like, Europe
today?

251
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,020
This is crazy.

252
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,040
Hi.

253
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:44,860
Hello!

254
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,040
Wow, go to sleep!

255
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,260
But, um, the stream was so funny.

256
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,480
I still am having issues with my VR chat for anyone curious.

257
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:08,800
And if, uh, basically, last time I tried to do a VR chat
stream, My audio has not been coming out of my headset.

258
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,580
So I can't hear anything.

259
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:18,300
I have to turn on my computer speakers for me to do
anything, which is quite annoying.

260
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:29,600
And then I'm also having issues with just, I guess, my VR
chat account in general because I wasn't able to...

261
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,720
I wasn't able to add anybody as a friend or send anybody.

262
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:45,060
anything or receive anything it was crazy um was not lucky
enough certain ticket vendor hate i'm sorry congratulations

263
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:51,700
to all the ibusu made it probably better for my wallet not
to fly across half the country that's thinking on the bright

264
00:19:51,700 --> 00:20:02,120
side thank you so much brother thank you for trying
organizer thank you for the super chat thank you john thank

265
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,980
you for the super chat looking forward to the concert, I
will dress for the occasion.

266
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
Even if I could only get streaming tickets.

267
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,780
Volume 0, thank you.

268
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,140
Managed to get a ticket.

269
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,680
Mercurially, thank you!

270
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,060
Favorite memory from last year I played as Oslo and
mint-abanded I undress.

271
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,520
Have you tried using VR chat on your laptop to A-B test the
issues?

272
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:39,020
Well, I don't think I could use my headset, my VR headset on
my laptop but I've tried like uninstalling the steam VR

273
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:49,160
software and reinstalling and I've if there is a reddit
thread about it I have tried it the VR chat issues I'm not

274
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:56,660
so concerned about because I mean if I have to make another
VR chat account that's no biggie but you know the VR audio

275
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,040
issues are a It was a pretty big deal to me.

276
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:07,680
But it was just, I felt so bad because so many things were
scuffed during the stream because of me.

277
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,480
I couldn't go to the world because I couldn't see their
portals.

278
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:22,140
And that's also why I didn't stream my POV because I was
like, it's gonna be maybe hellish for anybody watching

279
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,560
because it will just be me having issues the whole time.

280
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,340
So I thought maybe it'll be fine if it's only Doki.

281
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,000
And I think Snuffy was streaming as well.

282
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,500
So Doki, Snuffy, POV.

283
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:43,600
But I was waiting for Doki to come pick me up for anybody
curious.

284
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,740
And I was like, I wonder if there's any Breaking Bad World.

285
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,060
Which is a completely stupid thing to think.

286
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,220
Because of course there's a Breaking Bad World.

287
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,280
And Happy New Year's everybody and us.

288
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,300
Happy New Year!

289
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,240
And I just saw the world was called Saul Goodman.

290
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,560
I don't think it had anything else called that.

291
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,860
And I just went in and everything was...

292
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,820
I mean, you saw how the world was.

293
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,160
And it was even worse in person.

294
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,940
Like with my own two eyes.

295
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,360
And I was like, I wasn't sure if Doki would...

296
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,260
would come looking for me or not.

297
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,740
So I just kind of was sitting in there and admiring the
view.

298
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,500
It was so loud.

299
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,800
I passed out halfway through and woke up to the Saul Goodman
verse and just figured I was still asleep.

300
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,760
Also, RS Nation, thank you!

301
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,400
Wow on a plane?

302
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,260
Holy cow!

303
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,640
Wow, the plane must have amazing internet.

304
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,780
Thank you so much, see you there!

305
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,780
But I'm really glad that it ended up being a funny moment
for everybody.

306
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,500
Honestly, like the whole chain of events is just so funny.

307
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,200
Like Doki going back to the fishing world and being like
Mint Mint and then her checking where I'm at and she's like

308
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,040
what why the heck is she us?

309
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,140
And then her joining the world she's like Oh my god!

310
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,920
And then...

311
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,160
And then running around being like, Pirate!

312
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,500
Where are you?

313
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,680
And then I didn't know that you could see me in the first
couple...

314
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,060
Okay.

315
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,980
Doki asked me later.

316
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,220
She was like, didn't you hear me calling out to you?

317
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,180
This goes back to my audio issues.

318
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,640
If anybody was talking very low, I could not hear them.

319
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,360
Because I was too afraid of turning my speaker.

320
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,820
up and receive it you guys receiving feedback because you
know you would hear it would pick up be picked up by my

321
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:19,360
headset mic or something and so I couldn't hear it so the
music was so loud the music was so loud she was just a

322
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:28,780
little bit far away you know just far enough I had no idea
She was there.

323
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,640
I've had the VR audio thing before.

324
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,780
Is the output set to the right device when it's on?

325
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,780
You can set it by left-clicking the speaker in the system
tray and expanding the menu.

326
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,400
Yeah, see, that's the funny thing.

327
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,920
It doesn't show up in the menu.

328
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,220
Yeah.

329
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,280
I've gone through a bajillion things.

330
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,040
Honestly, Doki was like, you might need to buy a new
headset.

331
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,540
And I'm like...

332
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,360
A Valve Index is...

333
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:05,520
thousand dollars like and i know i've had it for like i've
had it for many years now at this point i bought it when i

334
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:16,040
first debuted ish so i've had it for a very very long time
but it's crazy expensive i can't just be dropping that like

335
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:26,600
like you know i don't know could wait for the new valve vr
set That's what I think I might do.

336
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,580
I'm not gonna lie.

337
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,980
Have you talked to that VR chat rep person Doki recommended
yet?

338
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,140
Oh, no, not yet.

339
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,060
But I don't think they'll be able to help with the headset.

340
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,680
I think they can only help with VR chat.

341
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,260
Doki says that maybe I accidentally dropped it.

342
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,420
And that some...

343
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,120
But I didn't.

344
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,460
I take care of my things.

345
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:47,940
And...

346
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:49,660
Um...

347
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:50,980
And...

348
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,640
I think, uh...

349
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,920
It...

350
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,580
What's the word?

351
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,160
I think it would still pick up, right?

352
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,200
Like, I feel like it would still pick up in the sound
settings under, like, output.

353
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,200
I feel like it would still show up there, even if, like, the
speakers were...

354
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,220
Or, like, the thing itself were broken.

355
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,300
Hmm.

356
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,940
Yeah, so...

357
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,840
I...

358
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,760
I seriously, you guys, I have tried everything.

359
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,840
There is not...

360
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,400
A Reddit thread that I have not gone through.

361
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,940
There is not a YouTube tutorial that I have not tried.

362
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,740
I have literally tried everything.

363
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,760
I don't think a VR chat representative will be able to help
me with it.

364
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,140
I think they can help me with my VR chat account.

365
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,420
But I don't even have their information, so.

366
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,640
But everything else is so cool and your models are super
cute.

367
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,400
Yeah!

368
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,900
I had so much fun.

369
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,720
Don't get me wrong.

370
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,500
I had a super...

371
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,700
super duper amount of fun.

372
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:05,920
I'm glad that I could take everybody on the planes and and
and Saul Goodman World.

373
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,840
I actually went to another Breaking Bad World where it was
like a parkour and I was doing that for quite a bit of time

374
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,020
too while I was waiting for them to come and find me.

375
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,310
Doki was working on something.

376
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,730
And I was like, la la la.

377
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,870
Breaking Bad Parkour

378
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:42,590
maybe next time i do vr chat um sound issues be damned i
mean it would outputs for you guys you guys would be able to

379
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:51,890
hear it so make you enjoy welcome back thank you thank you
thank you

380
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:01,750
doki running around and chatting for you with the heads is
exactly how i didn't know i wanted to start the new year it

381
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:12,590
was so funny oh i'm glad that i'm glad it could be a good
first memory but i feel like i felt i felt you know that it

382
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:23,750
was a pretty good like uh it was a good start to the year
maybe so i'm quite hopeful about having lots of fun

383
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,530
throughout the year so

384
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,110
I'm quite hopeful.

385
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,630
But I was getting so tired by the end of it.

386
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,870
I was like, I'm just gonna lay down.

387
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,670
And the back of the VR headset has like a big old cushion.

388
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,290
So it felt like a pillow.

389
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,390
And I was like starting to fall asleep for real.

390
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,730
So for the new VR headset, do you sell a kidney or one of
your RAM sticks?

391
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,190
I think YouTube censors kidney or RAM.

392
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,850
Clearly they're equally horrific.

393
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:52,750
No!

394
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,830
Not my RAM!

395
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,410
No!

396
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,420
Have you tried throwing it into a pond and seeing if some
nice pond lady comes up and offers you a silver or gold

397
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,280
version of it?

398
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,580
Of my VR headset, I could try.

399
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,380
And I'll say, no.

400
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,220
No, ma'am.

401
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,000
I want the original.

402
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,120
And she'll be like, you have a good heart.

403
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,520
Or you have heard this story before.

404
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,380
And then I'll get it for free.

405
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:38,120
but yeah I just feel like I don't know like obviously I use
my VR but I don't use it enough to where I feel like I can

406
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,420
justify dropping another $1,000 on it

407
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:55,140
I'm still thinking about it when is the next VR steam VR
thing planning planning to come out I don't know.

408
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,720
Steam VR...

409
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,740
Not Steam VR.

410
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,520
Steam VR headset.

411
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,340
It's like not gonna be called a Valve.

412
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,920
Was it the Steam frame?

413
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,820
Is that it?

414
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,820
March!

415
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,680
No way!

416
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,720
That's so soon!

417
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,340
Wait, I'm clicking on this link.

418
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,140
Steam frame!

419
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:15,660
Wait.

420
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,320
It looks nice.

421
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,380
Is it cordless?

422
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,480
Oh my gosh, it is!

423
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,900
That's huge!

424
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,460
If I got this, I would play Half-Life Alex.

425
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,900
Or maybe I'd be scared too, I don't know.

426
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,800
Whoa, even the controllers are all new and everything.

427
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,460
It kind of looks like those Apple goggles.

428
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,620
What were those called?

429
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,720
Would that mean lag though?

430
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,500
I don't know, that's a good point.

431
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,900
My only problem is they get VR sickness, like, whoa.

432
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,600
No, I get it though, I get it.

433
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,720
Depending on the game, some games are really terrible.

434
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,560
The Apple Vision.

435
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,780
Is that the thing?

436
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,260
Apple Vision.

437
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

438
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:21,440
I'm gonna become one of those people walking around, wearing
it, and I'm gonna have my arms swiping around.

439
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
I'm gonna become one of those people walking down.

440
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:39,960
Jarvis Cancel my meeting I'm going to brunch Do people still
wear these?

441
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,240
I feel like they were such a fad

442
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:56,720
I'm wow Oh my gosh there's like Wait a second I have to show
you guys the website for this Steam frame Wait hold on one

443
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
second I gotta show you.

444
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,280
We're gonna take a quick detour.

445
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,160
Quick detour, quick detour.

446
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,480
Oh, that was my controller disconnecting.

447
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:08,920
Don't mind.

448
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,280
Don't mind.

449
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,620
Don't mind.

450
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,660
Don't mind.

451
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,740
Okay, so they're like, this is it.

452
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,880
This is the steam frame, right?

453
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,900
I'm minding.

454
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,420
Don't mind.

455
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:25,920
Don't mind.

456
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,420
See, it looks really nice, though.

457
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,920
It looks so small.

458
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,180
Well, you can't tell right now, but it looks...

459
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:41,020
like it'll fit it'll be not so heavy because the valve index
is like a million bricks on my head right now it looks very

460
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:56,320
small and i don't know how i feel about the these though but
look how small it is wow and then and then that's gonna be

461
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:07,220
me what game is this that's not half-life is it that's
Jarvis, make Minto trip on a cartoon banana peel.

462
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,300
That's me.

463
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,480
Oh, it is Half-Life.

464
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,220
I could tell.

465
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,380
Grandma.

466
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,880
Grandma is playing the VR.

467
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,180
I think grandma would literally get psychosis from that.

468
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,960
And then, oh, let's see.

469
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,160
High quality streaming.

470
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,260
Streaming first experience.

471
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,220
That's what I do.

472
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,180
Streaming can be highly variable, so we prioritize.

473
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,120
making steam frame a stable, high-quality streaming
experience.

474
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,100
I believe the words on the screen.

475
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,240
You know that the tallest building on earth is...

476
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,240
Word Khalifa.

477
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,440
With 828 meters, but it's still not enough to reach your
cuteness level.

478
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,460
Stoven.

479
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,160
I don't know if I said that right, though.

480
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,660
Seamless audio experience.

481
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,160
Currently, I have no audio experience.

482
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,300
an upgrade.

483
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,360
Me?

484
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,880
That's literally me?

485
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,460
Grandma!

486
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,140
Look, it looks so small.

487
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,900
Okay, what I wanted to show you...

488
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,660
Actually, I don't remember.

489
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,580
Oh, the...

490
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:22,820
Wait.

491
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,800
Was it...

492
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,520
Why don't you just get on your PC?

493
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,240
Stop.

494
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:31,800
Stop.

495
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,740
Don't bother me.

496
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,740
I'm playing game in VR.

497
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:58,280
is it light though let's see does it say how heavy it is oh
no we'll never get one wait why does the headset need

498
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:06,700
storage wait do I have to get the 1 terabyte headset ref ref
Ram!

499
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,760
How heavy are you?

500
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,840
How heavy are you?

501
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,340
Oh wait!

502
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:13,920
G.

503
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,660
440 G.

504
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,140
Wait, why is the head strap so heavy?

505
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,920
You can load games on it.

506
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Oh!

507
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,740
I see, I see.

508
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,860
It's a standalone device?

509
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,080
Wait, that's kind of insane.

510
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,280
I wonder how heavy the valve index is, though.

511
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,230
One replaceable double A battery.

512
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,930
Wait, what?

513
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,510
They're not...

514
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,810
Wait, what?

515
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,250
They're not chargeable?

516
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,670
It's double A battery?

517
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:57,970
Wait, what?

518
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,430
For the controller?

519
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,670
Yeah, but like, they're not like...

520
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,230
No way.

521
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,770
I'm gonna have to buy batteries for it.

522
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,130
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.

523
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:19,970
I know!

524
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,480
I choked on my ectoplasm!

525
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,540
Happy New Year!

526
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,580
Don't have to further nudge you towards replacing hardware
if you need to!

527
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,720
It's good to be frugal but the frustration is not worth your
time if it's busted.

528
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,820
Time wasted!

529
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,700
Time wasted on troubleshooting!

530
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,960
That is time you can spend on literally anything else.

531
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,060
Thank you!

532
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,920
So you can swap it if it dies in the middle of a game.

533
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,980
I just plug in my controller.

534
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,440
I had to do that for the VR collab.

535
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,580
One of my controllers was literally plugged in the whole
time.

536
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,840
I think it's just strange that we...

537
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
Are doing...

538
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,460
Batteries.

539
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,660
Like, I guess I could get rechargeable batteries, but I
still feel like it's a pain in the booty.

540
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,540
It's cool to see that Barry became the fourth member of
Densitou.exe and Barrybook.

541
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,020
I didn't expect that at all.

542
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,620
I'm confused.

543
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,580
Where did that come from?

544
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,480
Why is Barry in Densitou?

545
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,060
Why don't we switch?

546
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,400
What if I go to Beasties?

547
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
I think I'm more Monster Girl than she is.

548
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,800
She made a joke.

549
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,980
She just made it.

550
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,930
interesting what the hell

551
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:11,120
I'm a monster girl too Eric I got a new bike for Christmas
and one of my goals this year is to get in better shape with

552
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:19,620
it and go many places with it wish me luck I hope 2026 is a
great year for you too good luck oh my gosh

553
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:28,980
biking sound oh my gosh I was just thinking that like okay
so recently hold on let me let me okay we're done looking at

554
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,580
the, we're done looking at this guy, even though he's so
cute.

555
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,860
It's pretty cute, I'm not gonna lie.

556
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:48,980
Um, but, uh, I was talking to a friend the other day, and I
was like, I've seen so many electric bikes recently.

557
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:58,920
Um, like I saw a kid on an electric bike, and I've just seen
more of them recently, and I'm like, honestly, you know, I'm

558
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,420
kind of here for it.

559
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,420
I'm here for the electric bike era.

560
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,960
Because it's like...

561
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,980
It's like...

562
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,780
You know, they...

563
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,040
I bet it's so much...

564
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,380
It's like you can get to a place so fast.

565
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,940
And you're still biking.

566
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,240
So you're getting a little bit of exercise at least.

567
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,840
And they're not as scary as like a scooter, I feel.

568
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,160
Because scooters, I hear that people will like hit a weird
bump.

569
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,840
And they'll be going really fast on them.

570
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,480
And hit a bump.

571
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,200
And like...

572
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,280
You know, like that.

573
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,220
And...

574
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,220
Um...

575
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,500
I don't know...

576
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
They're kind of banned where I am because of the fire hazard
quality.

577
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,860
Wait, there's a fire hazard!

578
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,120
Scooters are a dentist's best friend.

579
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

580
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,100
Everyone will say they will still bike and end up only using
the engine.

581
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,560
Ah, that's fair.

582
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I mean...

583
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,060
But...

584
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,260
kind of sketchy since they're fast and don't have good
breaks but if we if we kept working towards it i feel like

585
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:11,460
there's such a good alternative you know i don't know as
long as people aren't stupid but that's asking a lot isn't

586
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:20,360
it that's asking me for so much but i just think it's not so
much nicer because sometimes i don't want to i want a bike i

587
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:29,640
don't want to drive way too much I like thinking about
bikes.

588
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,120
The e-bike batteries can explode or catch fire while
charging.

589
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,080
Holy moly!

590
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,380
That's scary.

591
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,140
Can't you fly?

592
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,120
I can float.

593
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,480
I can't fly.

594
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm not a bird.

595
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,480
That would take, like, so much of my energy to fly.

596
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,460
This is not a joke.

597
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,140
The guy who invented the segue...

598
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,920
Died riding a segue off a cliff to demonstrate how safe they
are and how fast they can stop.

599
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,180
That's not a joke.

600
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,320
Wait, that's not real.

601
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,620
I'm going to look it up.

602
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,460
Death of the segue.

603
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,580
Segway company owner rides scooter off cliff, comma dies.

604
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,420
It's not funny.

605
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,460
He puts a headline.

606
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,400
It's just...

607
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,660
I just read the headline, you guys!

608
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,980
That's what it says!

609
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,580
Wow, this happened so long ago.

610
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,660
This happened in 2010!

611
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,200
In two- Jimmy Heseldon.

612
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,320
In 2009, he bought Segway Inc.

613
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,180
He died in 2010 from injuries.

614
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,040
Sustained falling from a cliff while riding his own Segway.

615
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,120
You know, I have to give him credit.

616
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,280
He really trusted in his own product.

617
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,160
Would you take Otacon on your e-bike?

618
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,120
Oh, yeah.

619
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,900
Holy moly.

620
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,120
Command was committed to the bit.

621
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,620
Like, he really believed in his product.

622
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,800
Unfortunately, that's so sad, though, that, like, nah, he
just bought the company.

623
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:36,760
I mean, it did, but, like, He still did that demonstration
because he thought that he would not die.

624
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,380
So it's not the inventor, though.

625
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,020
It's just the owner that, the person that owned the company
at the time.

626
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,280
May the kamiyoshi protect my travels, Honda gang.

627
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,680
May the kamiyoshi protect your travels.

628
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,660
Sorry, I'm coughing so much today.

629
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,300
I'm going to take another sip.

630
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:15,130
I've never seen a segue though outside of a mall and outside
of those like sometimes some cities did segue tours.

631
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:27,900
Those are the only two times I've never seen someone like a
like a private segue user.

632
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
I've never seen what IRL.

633
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,220
Yeah yeah I feel like it no.

634
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:32,580
Never seen.

635
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:57,310
Anyway I think I've I hope you guys had a wonderful new year
welcoming welcoming of of the new year I hope it was lots of

636
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:05,250
fun for you guys so and thanks for coming back thanks for
being here with me!

637
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:06,270
Thank you!

638
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,210
Welcome back to OneShot!

639
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:18,510
Let me turn on my control- My controller is turned on.

640
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,850
Today we're playing New Game Plus.

641
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,450
Nico feels uneasy.

642
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:28,670
Today we're playing New Game Plus of the game to get the
true ending.

643
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,190
And...

644
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:32,670
Yeah!

645
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,650
This is not our one shot.

646
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,290
This is our two shot.

647
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,070
New Year's was fun with you and Sloppy Sisters and thank you
for the New Year's post.

648
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:42,870
Of course!

649
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,090
Oh, I wanted to post it earlier.

650
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:50,750
I wanted to post it so much earlier, but I was struggling
you guys with the picture.

651
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,890
I feel still, like, so...

652
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:59,770
I saw a post on my timeline that was, like, someone who...

653
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,290
Um... Who...

654
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:11,630
Kind of like, they weren't tracing or anything, don't get me
wrong, but they were looking at a picture and then, like,

655
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,990
trying to draw the same exact picture.

656
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,530
And theirs turned out, like, really kind of funky.

657
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,410
Like, it was a Takane from Idol Master.

658
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:21,890
Yeah, like, a reference.

659
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,370
But they were trying to do it one for one, you know.

660
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:32,390
And they were like, they were like, man, like, the original
is so cute, but mine turned out so funky.

661
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:40,210
And, um, even though I was, like, looking and trying to
emulate the same exact everything.

662
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:52,010
Um, and I, I've, I've, I have tried doing that to kind of,
like, reference, like, a pose or something and be like, oh,

663
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,370
maybe, like, I draw, I've drawn so much more than I've
posted.

664
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,230
Yeah, it's not weird for practicing at all.

665
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:06,150
No, no, I'm not trying to say, I'm not trying to, um, uh,
I'm not trying to like shame the guy or anything.

666
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:14,930
What I was trying to say is that the same thing has happened
to me where I'll look at a picture and in my brain I'm like,

667
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,350
yeah, this is pretty simple.

668
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,170
Like it'll even be like a simple sketch.

669
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,730
And I'll be like, this is pretty simple.

670
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:24,790
I think I can, you know, kind of recreate this with my own
way.

671
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,330
And then I'll try it and I'll be like, why does this look so
bad?

672
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:31,570
Why?

673
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:33,690
I'm here.

674
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,570
I know it's all part of the process, but it's still like...

675
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:37,870
Ah!

676
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,870
Many such cases.

677
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:49,230
It's just, you know...

678
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:53,710
I've always obviously had an appreciation for artists and
everything.

679
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:58,390
It's just like, oh my gosh, it feels so daunting.

680
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:03,750
I'm like, you know, I see people that can do backgrounds and
this and that and amazing.

681
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:13,130
stuff and I'm like you know I'm not not trying to become
like a professional level or anything but I would like to

682
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:31,140
get pretty decent but thank you everybody who thinks my art
is is cute so far thank you it's hard when you know a lot

683
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:40,700
about art but aren't practiced enough to do it yourself yeah
I don't all i get really scared about like learning coloring

684
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:48,800
techniques and stuff that stuff that's something i have zero
knowledge about like i can do it but like i'm i see like

685
00:47:48,800 --> 00:48:02,620
people's people's like time lapses and things and i'm like
what are you doing how'd you do that so robot what's left of

686
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:15,460
a robot so i'm guessing i kind of do the same thing before
and we go to that building over here one step at a time like

687
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:22,840
you've done so far super cute and you'll only grow i don't
know i've been like kind of picky about what i post so i'll

688
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:29,620
try to draw something and then erase erase erase i try to
draw something erase erase erase erase i try i had a

689
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:41,980
completely different picture drawn for the new year for the
new year letter and then I I said thank you, Duargo, thank

690
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:53,720
you and then I totally scrapped it so I was like, no yeah,
it's totally normal that's how it goes, yeah ah, that light

691
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,440
bulb you are here, me?

692
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:05,760
yes, welcome to our world friend I am most humbled by your
presence, yes thanks sorry, I'm a little lost wait, is this

693
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,720
all This is all the same dialogue, but I don't want to skip
anything because I'm nervous that maybe Nico will be like

694
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,660
something else, you know?

695
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,780
That's how it goes.

696
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,140
I would want to see the ones that you scrapped too.

697
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,200
No, I'm too self-conscious.

698
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,660
I'm too self-conscious.

699
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,920
May I ask how you arrived here?

700
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,260
I'm not sure.

701
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,700
I woke up in this weird house.

702
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,400
Uh, uh, it was really dark.

703
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,600
Oh, so you woke up in an unfamiliar dark location.

704
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,240
Mm-hmm.

705
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,300
Just as my prophecy foretold, yes.

706
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,860
You are the savior we have been waiting for.

707
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:49,740
Jasmine!

708
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,900
Welcome to Mambusha, thank you.

709
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,420
Maybe just not narrate it if it's old.

710
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:56,980
Maybe.

711
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:58,940
Save the world from eternal darkness.

712
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,540
I'll skip it a little bit.

713
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,280
Vital information.

714
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,360
Please ask me anything.

715
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,260
Uh, can you tell me about...

716
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,220
About Adminto!

717
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,600
That one's new.

718
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,160
When I woke up in that house, for some reason I called out a
name, Adminto.

719
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,740
Commander Muffin!

720
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,240
Welcome to Bevbusha.

721
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,860
Oh my gosh, I love your profile picture.

722
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,580
I love Suboyants.

723
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,820
They're so cute.

724
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,940
They're so cute.

725
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,580
Adminto is very stinky.

726
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,140
Hey!

727
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,380
I showered this morning.

728
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,860
I'm not sure why I did that.

729
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,500
But then I saw it on a computer, too.

730
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,640
Ah, that would be our god.

731
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,300
Oh, right.

732
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,120
I think I feel like I remember something about that.

733
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,100
You do?

734
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,640
But wait, did you not just arrive here?

735
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,240
I was the one who was supposed to inform you of that.

736
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,640
So how did you know?

737
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,900
Um, it just made sense, I guess.

738
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,440
Ah, have you already contacted Adminto then?

739
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,260
Nope.

740
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,240
I just have to close my eyes and focus, right?

741
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,620
I am here, Nico.

742
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,880
Hey, Admito.

743
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:12,420
God?

744
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,900
This is going to sound weird, but...

745
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,760
Have we met before?

746
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,560
Do I tell the truth?

747
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,440
Do I tell the truth?

748
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:25,580
Hmm.

749
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,560
I'll say yes.

750
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:29,600
Yes.

751
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,340
But I don't know who you are, though.

752
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,680
It's just a weird feeling that I have.

753
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,440
I'm just being silly, aren't I?

754
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,520
Would you lie to Nico?

755
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,100
No.

756
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:41,720
Sorry.

757
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,940
But it's nice to meet you, Adminto.

758
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,620
My name is Nico.

759
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,720
I know.

760
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,580
I just contacted Adminto, yeah?

761
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,220
Do not be afraid to ask Adminto for assistance.

762
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,220
You are the Messiah, after all.

763
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,540
Can you tell me...

764
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,120
I think we were good with these.

765
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,620
Oh, wait.

766
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,940
I think I have to do all of them.

767
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,600
The world, everything's so dark.

768
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,560
The world is divided into three regions, apparently.

769
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,880
Going to the tower.

770
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,360
In the outpost we gotta get a map.

771
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,340
The light bulb.

772
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,460
The new sun is the light bulb.

773
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,260
Light went out.

774
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,430
The new sun you restored at the tower.

775
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,790
Cool, cool, cool.

776
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,990
Nico is so cute.

777
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:34,550
I know.

778
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:36,990
That looks pretty far off.

779
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,190
So begins your pilgrimage.

780
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:41,930
If the sun shatters, the world will end in an instant.

781
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:47,610
Going home.

782
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:52,150
I want to go home.

783
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:55,070
Your mission is to save our world.

784
00:52:56,930 --> 00:52:59,230
Just as my mission is to tell you about our world.

785
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:04,570
Okay, I think that's all I have to ask for now.

786
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,010
Excellent, I wish you luck.

787
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,070
Alright, let's grab our map.

788
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:10,230
Which is...

789
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,930
Those are all probably all the same too, right?

790
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,510
I think so.

791
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,150
Oh, we need the battery.

792
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,150
Love the sound of the footprints.

793
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:28,850
Oh, wait.

794
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:29,310
There it is.

795
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:29,650
Over there.

796
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,550
This is the law of robots.

797
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,450
Our map.

798
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:34,890
Of the world.

799
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:35,270
Oh, wait.

800
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:36,170
Just kidding.

801
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,290
We didn't get a map of the world.

802
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,230
What were they thinking of that?

803
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:40,970
We needed a map.

804
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:44,230
Okay.

805
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:45,710
this should still be the same.

806
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:50,930
If anybody has played this game and I have missed something,
feel free to yell at me.

807
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:51,930
It won't turn on.

808
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:52,250
Okay.

809
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:54,870
The tippy taps.

810
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:56,290
I know they're so satisfying.

811
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:57,590
It's like...

812
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,690
I love it.

813
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:07,330
I never thought of myself as a big ASMR person, but the more
I hear like a...

814
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,690
It sounds really nice.

815
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,320
Heh heh.

816
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,760
Hojo danjo!

817
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,180
Welcome to Membuship.

818
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,400
Thank you!

819
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:24,900
Thank you, thank you.

820
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,720
Minto ASMR.

821
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,980
Should I do ASMR again?

822
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,320
I don't know though.

823
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,400
I can't take it seriously when I do it.

824
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,520
I can't remember where I got that pipe from.

825
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,060
Oh wait!

826
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,550
Do you remember the code?

827
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,210
Doesn't have to be serious.

828
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,270
I've got to try out, like, an RP.

829
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,110
A roleplay.

830
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:04,790
ASMR.

831
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,010
But I don't know what.

832
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:06,690
Kind.

833
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:07,770
Babycore!

834
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:08,510
Thanks for the gift.

835
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,330
Maybe it's in the documents folder still.

836
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,090
Oh, it might be.

837
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:15,930
Wait, maybe.

838
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:20,390
We could really speedrun some of this.

839
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,150
Wait, what's over here?

840
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,710
I haven't been over here yet.

841
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:28,530
I haven't been here before.

842
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,570
I don't remember any of this.

843
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:34,270
Gas.

844
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:36,490
Cannot breathe.

845
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,090
It hurts to breathe.

846
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,470
Do you want to open some missions for scripts?

847
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,590
That sounds dangerous.

848
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,070
Guys, you're going to make me say some real freaky things.

849
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,810
Maybe I should try just a regular ASM.

850
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:54,510
modifiers.

851
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,630
Since I feel a little self-conscious when I do them.

852
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,240
Oh,

853
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,500
it was Crow Country that I was thinking of that I needed the
maps.

854
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:25,260
I was like, there was a game that I played recently where I
did not know where to go ever, and I needed maps for stuff.

855
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,900
Crow Country.

856
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,580
This seems like... Okay, this did loop, okay.

857
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,220
Very cool.

858
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,300
What about this one?

859
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,520
ever read this?

860
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,600
No, I don't remember.

861
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,620
The sun will not return and the abyss is calling my name.

862
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,440
I'm sorry, everyone, for choosing to leave behind the
darkness.

863
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:49,140
Choosing to leave before the darkness suffocates us all.

864
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,140
I love how you still have shortcuts for Harvester and
Mystery of the Druids on your desktop.

865
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,220
Yeah!

866
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,340
I do.

867
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:11,850
That one was not such a nice one.

868
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,200
I think I think we get the steel pipe from in here, right?

869
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,860
The light bulb.

870
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,660
RP ASMR, you mean like clumsy boyfriend sinks cruise ship
killing thousands of ASMR?

871
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:33,920
I would totally listen to a silly otaku gets lost and
Aki-bum falls downstairs into a haunted makeup ASMR.

872
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,920
That sounds like a realistic one that I could do.

873
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,480
The light bulb.

874
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,800
So you are the Messiah?

875
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,260
That's what I've been told.

876
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,440
I expected someone taller.

877
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,860
Or at least someone that doesn't look like a kitten.

878
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,400
So you're some sort of cat?

879
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,500
I'm a person.

880
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,140
Uh...

881
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,100
I'm letting the world die naturally.

882
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:08,960
Let's see.

883
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,540
Just got here, yeah.

884
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,740
We're gonna go to the tower.

885
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,560
We know that the tower contains a force that nobody can
comprehend.

886
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,600
The power is the strongest at the summit.

887
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,340
Maybe it will send you back home after you complete your
mission.

888
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,080
Maybe.

889
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,060
Oh.

890
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,100
Don't take my word for it, though.

891
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,880
We already know.

892
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,280
We already know.

893
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:33,660
Screwdriver.

894
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,260
We got a screwdriver.

895
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,440
It's already been a couple days since I last played this, so
I'm kind of like...

896
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,240
What's inside the tower?

897
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,580
Trying to remember.

898
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,500
Nobody's ever entered it before.

899
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,340
At least nobody's ever.

900
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,320
History knows.

901
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,560
Who built it?

902
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,100
It's been here since the beginning of time.

903
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,720
Further assistance, we're good things.

904
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,120
Oh yeah, there was something in...

905
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,780
We go here and then Silver's like, Stop!

906
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,800
It's been a year since you played this game.

907
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,740
I haven't played this game since last year.

908
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,060
Go into the mines.

909
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,760
Thank you.

910
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,500
What's that?

911
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,440
Oh!

912
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,520
Oh.

913
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,700
Got that part of a camera?

914
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:37,540
That...

915
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,380
That was new.

916
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,500
That didn't flash before, right?

917
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,640
You were starting to black out.

918
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,300
I saw something.

919
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,460
That was a really short dream.

920
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,020
just now.

921
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:58,780
A dream.

922
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,420
Not a hallucination.

923
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,480
Oh, I saw something like...

924
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,520
Chippers, thank you!

925
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,360
Thank you, thank you.

926
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,340
A robot with a yellow eye.

927
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,880
That's strange.

928
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,940
Are you sure you're okay?

929
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,140
Yeah.

930
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,960
You know, now that you have mentioned it, there is a robot
who always insisted on going back to the abandoned mines.

931
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,640
Despite how long the mines have been in disrepair, I hope
he's okay.

932
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:37,800
He doesn't look broken or anything, but I didn't really see
him see him, you know.

933
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,920
Like I said, it was kind of like a dream.

934
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,560
And he was up close.

935
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,200
Yeah, I'm seeing things.

936
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,840
Sounds like some kind of visual glitch or hallucination.

937
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,800
That's what I said.

938
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,680
Whatever it is that living beings have.

939
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,920
Does that robot know you have a yellow eye?

940
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,380
I don't think I've seen any other robots like that.

941
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:04,880
I would not know.

942
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,220
Wait, they don't...

943
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:10,420
Oh, I thought Nico meant that Silver has a yellow eye.

944
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:12,860
I never met him myself.

945
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,360
Only heard of him from a friend of mine.

946
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:15,800
Your friend, huh?

947
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:19,440
Hold on, something in my pocket is...

948
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,500
Is that something in your pocket?

949
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,040
Are you just happy to see me?

950
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,200
What is happening?

951
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,460
This wasn't glowing before.

952
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,940
What is this?

953
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,500
That was going to be my question.

954
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,540
Where did you get that book?

955
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,680
They're both.

956
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,080
I am happy to see you.

957
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,380
Really?

958
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,540
I am just happy to see you.

959
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,680
I'm so happy to see you.

960
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,140
It was with me when I woke up back at the house.

961
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,340
I didn't really question it.

962
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:57,920
the time.

963
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,980
I flipped through a couple of pages, but I didn't understand
a... But I don't understand a word.

964
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,460
Is that just something Messiahs they're supposed to wake up
with?

965
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,780
No, I've never heard of anything like that.

966
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,260
I'm always happy to see you.

967
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,960
It's become a medical condition.

968
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,220
Like a virus?

969
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,060
But I know who wrote the book.

970
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:32,760
Oh?

971
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:36,520
However, I've only seen his books with a black clover on the
hover.

972
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:43,100
If you went through the trouble of putting yellow phosphor
in it, and the fact that you woke up with it in the first

973
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,720
place really has me intrigued.

974
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,720
A Minto virus.

975
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,800
Get infected, get infected, get infected.

976
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,200
Mad minky disease.

977
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,740
Yellow phosphor?

978
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,120
Well, yeah, that's the rare phosphor that people think the
sun is made of, right?

979
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,120
Wait a minute.

980
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,060
How do I know this?

981
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:12,680
Delicious!

982
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,840
I don't think anyone's told me about it.

983
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:19,900
Uh, I can show you if you'd like.

984
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,400
My friend gave me this a long time ago.

985
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:32,380
Looks like there's a clover in the necklace too!

986
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,680
Mint wouldn't leave us to be swallowed by darkness.

987
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,280
Nah.

988
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:38,940
Nah.

989
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,320
Nico knows too much.

990
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,820
Silver's gonna push him down into the depths.

991
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,100
You know too much.

992
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:48,920
Like the book?

993
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:50,960
Well, it is the same person.

994
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,580
Oh, that's why I think this journal would be important.

995
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,540
You said it just started glowing?

996
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:58,460
Yeah.

997
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,800
That was right after your vision then.

998
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,740
This has to mean something.

999
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,040
Maybe you should at least try to read it again.

1000
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,580
It's glowing now?

1001
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:21,530
I feel like it's glowing.

1002
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,550
I found this page.

1003
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,670
New follower, looking forward to your stream.

1004
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:28,470
Thank you!

1005
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:28,970
Welcome!

1006
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,050
Looks kind of like a drawing of this room.

1007
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,750
Maybe it's telling us we should come here.

1008
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:37,270
Which we did already.

1009
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:39,210
So it looks like we're on our right track.

1010
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,570
It's showing like...

1011
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:48,550
Wait.

1012
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:54,830
Like right...

1013
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:56,670
Here, basically, no?

1014
01:04:58,430 --> 01:04:58,890
Yeah!

1015
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:00,110
I did it!

1016
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:01,250
I lined it up!

1017
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,520
What just happened?

1018
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:09,980
Dream Chasers!

1019
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:10,880
Thank you for the gift!

1020
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:11,880
Thank you!

1021
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:13,940
I'm not sure.

1022
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:14,680
I wasn't looking.

1023
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,480
To be honest, neither was I.

1024
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,360
I was just taking a closer look at the journal.

1025
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,080
And then I found this page that looks like a drawing of this
room.

1026
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,740
When I look back up, this minecart just showed up out of
thin air!

1027
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:30,440
Should I be worried?

1028
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,260
This looks like a standard issue minecart.

1029
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,260
Oh my gosh, we're playing.

1030
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:35,960
in Minecraft.

1031
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,460
Which means it likely detected the motion in this room and
sent itself over.

1032
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,740
Ah, that does make sense.

1033
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,060
No, it was me.

1034
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,840
It was all me.

1035
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:49,960
It was me.

1036
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,120
I deserve the credit.

1037
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:51,880
Me.

1038
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,020
I'm the inventor.

1039
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,700
I'm just surprised it still works.

1040
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,200
Guess that means we'll have a working vehicle now.

1041
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,220
Wait, this is so new.

1042
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,100
This is all new.

1043
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,720
Not sure why you would want to visit the deeper mines, but
if you wanted to, soon, we now have that option.

1044
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,520
Is the minecart even going to fit both of us?

1045
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:10,600
No.

1046
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,540
It was Adminto all along!

1047
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,340
But I wanted you to come with us.

1048
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:23,640
I know I've got Adminto, but honestly, this place gives me
the creeps.

1049
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,160
Oh, I can still come with.

1050
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,680
I would just have to follow along on the rails.

1051
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,660
But doesn't it look a little precarious?

1052
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,240
The magnetic rails can hold me in place.

1053
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:42,240
It's only ever dangerous to walk on if you're an organic
being guys if i'm a ghost and like jelly and ectoplasm does

1054
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:48,800
that count as organic i guess i don't have the metals in me

1055
01:06:55,450 --> 01:07:02,330
can't you just float i guess i could flow yeah i could flow
so

1056
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:17,380
you guys don't want to see my legs so you guys are not leg
people okay i got it so if i got if i if i always floated

1057
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,800
and never used my legs.

1058
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:33,560
Wait, wait, wait.

1059
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,440
That's what you said, though, no?

1060
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,910
Legs only, stream when?

1061
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:48,570
She's all legs.

1062
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,850
Which I am.

1063
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:51,250
Okay.

1064
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:53,850
Silver just said that I am an organic being.

1065
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:54,550
Gotcha.

1066
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:56,110
There we go.

1067
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,760
Oh, here we go.

1068
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,300
Give me a big old push.

1069
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:07,640
Oh, never mind.

1070
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,600
It's actually quite slow.

1071
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,700
Try to keep up, Silver.

1072
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,080
Likes.

1073
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:24,300
I do not recognize this place in the protocol.

1074
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,980
This isn't what I'm supposed to be showing you at all.

1075
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:30,700
How did you get here?

1076
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,360
I can only think of one person.

1077
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,860
He contacted you?

1078
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,540
How long has he been doing this?

1079
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,840
Minto always skips leg day.

1080
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:43,720
No!

1081
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:50,380
Call me to grant in the way I'm all about legs.

1082
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,060
It doesn't matter at this point.

1083
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,200
You are going out of bounds.

1084
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,720
You should turn back.

1085
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:02,500
Please turn back.

1086
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,960
Bad things are going to happen.

1087
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,060
Very bad things.

1088
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,960
At this rate, Niko will be in danger.

1089
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,560
Please turn back.

1090
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,680
We have to go!

1091
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,940
Niko is in danger anyway.

1092
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:39,070
What danger could come from going into an abandoned mine?

1093
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,310
Oh, the cart stopped.

1094
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:43,570
Looks like this is as far as the tracks go.

1095
01:09:45,650 --> 01:10:01,510
where are we one of the old observation rooms looks like
it's still mostly intact oh what oh the terminal just

1096
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:10,850
reactivated but the power was cut off so long ago weird oh
creepy maybe it runs on battery just like the steam the

1097
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:19,210
steam VR set no that's not it whatever it is I need to
investigate okay will you be okay by yourself for a bit

1098
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:31,410
don't worry i'm mean toes with me all right stay safe wait
can i investigate it too some sort of computer wait some

1099
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:35,090
sort of small machine i wonder what it does i can feel my
hair standing up a little

1100
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:51,990
oh we found him i recognize the light in your eyes You are
the person I am destined to meet.

1101
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:55,670
Wait, it's New Game Plus and we're meeting new characters?

1102
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:59,170
I too would feel safe with Adminto with me.

1103
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:00,350
No kidding!

1104
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,130
You would trust my judgment.

1105
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:07,710
Ah, what if it's the Ghostbusters?

1106
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:11,410
Now we're gonna get the heck out of here.

1107
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,070
What is your name?

1108
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,250
I'm Nico.

1109
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:17,690
Do you know who sent you?

1110
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:18,790
Oh.

1111
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:20,950
Um, no?

1112
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:25,150
Wait, do you mean who sent me to this world?

1113
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:29,390
There was a robot a while back who told me about how I'm the
Messiah and stuff.

1114
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,950
So I'm guessing I had Minto sent me.

1115
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:35,210
With them being God and all.

1116
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:41,350
The robot looks a little bit like you even.

1117
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,170
Maybe you know each other?

1118
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,530
Oh my gosh!

1119
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,230
Nico, not all the robots know each other!

1120
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,870
I cannot say.

1121
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:49,750
Oh?

1122
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:53,730
A lot of my memories have been removed for safety reasons.

1123
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:56,350
Hey, can I get some of that?

1124
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:00,030
Your memories were removed?

1125
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:02,550
That's terrible.

1126
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:07,190
Wait, I'm guessing that's less of a big deal for a robot.

1127
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,290
I'm going to assume you do not know who sent you.

1128
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,190
How did you get here then?

1129
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:17,450
How did you reach this room?

1130
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:29,190
here in a minecart but the minecart wasn't there when you
entered the mines was it oh yeah so how did you find it i

1131
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:35,610
didn't really find it the robot lady thinks it's was just
the minecart coming to us but i remember looking at the

1132
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:47,650
journal when it happened and when i looked up again the cart
was just there poof not poof it was more like a oh my gosh

1133
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:51,130
guys i need to drink more coffee i'm I'm not tired, but I
can't stop yawning today.

1134
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:04,940
Eepie.

1135
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:05,880
Not Eepie.

1136
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,120
Maybe a little Eepie.

1137
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,320
Maybe a little Eepie.

1138
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,260
I did nothing yesterday, though.

1139
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,260
It was pretty nice.

1140
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:15,680
I watched some Breaking Bad.

1141
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,200
I did a little bit of work, but a tiny bit.

1142
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,760
Just some time-sensitive things.

1143
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,500
And I cleaned.

1144
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:25,360
My New Year's Day was very relaxing.

1145
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,080
The game's BGM may have a calming effect.

1146
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,680
You know, it might actually be that.

1147
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,220
And it's so like...

1148
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,640
He's so nice to listen to.

1149
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,660
I'm on season four.

1150
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,640
The solstice has begun.

1151
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,740
What's the solstice?

1152
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,080
Oh, wait.

1153
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,520
That was a password, wasn't it?

1154
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:58,840
I'm on like see I'm on season four episode like two I think
maybe

1155
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:15,920
solstice more than a season ahead of me I've been I've been
flying through it I'm not gonna lie um but I watch it and I

1156
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:22,140
draw it's pretty nice and then what are there what six five
or Six?

1157
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:24,540
Seasons?

1158
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,380
Still thinking about doing a finale watch along?

1159
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,980
The path in this game is called the Solstice Run.

1160
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:42,380
Five seasons.

1161
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,040
Five seasons.

1162
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,480
And then I watch Better Call Saul, which I'm so excited for
because I love Saul.

1163
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,300
He's like, him, him and Mike are my favorites.

1164
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,180
Gosh, it's scary.

1165
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,260
But I like him too.

1166
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,940
The El Camino movie.

1167
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,080
What's that?

1168
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,160
I don't know that one.

1169
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:15,930
Also watch El Camino.

1170
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:20,990
It's a movie with Jesse.

1171
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:23,230
Oh, it's a sequel movie.

1172
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:24,890
Breaking Bad Appelot!

1173
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:25,150
Wait.

1174
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:28,090
Was... Well, I guess...

1175
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:29,750
as an epilogue.

1176
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:31,110
I guess I know who lives.

1177
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,870
I guess Jesse makes it out.

1178
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:44,530
It's okay.

1179
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:44,950
It's okay.

1180
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,610
You guys.

1181
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,930
I know you guys probably didn't even think about it at all.

1182
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:51,370
Don't worry.

1183
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:53,550
I would fumble like that too.

1184
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:54,990
Don't even...

1185
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:01,710
Maybe he dies in the movie.

1186
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:02,790
So true.

1187
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:08,870
It's, yeah, it's told from the perspective of his ghost.

1188
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,050
It's okay.

1189
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:18,910
I'm not even mad.

1190
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:19,910
Don't worry, guys.

1191
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:22,990
It's so funny, though.

1192
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:28,450
It's actually Jesse Jr. His baby.

1193
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:31,590
Who lived on

1194
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:54,970
Good save, yeah good save He ate Walter's cancer Okay,
anyway Intouristic Please show me this journal Okay Then it

1195
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:57,150
has already begun What?

1196
01:16:57,470 --> 01:16:58,130
What are the numbers?

1197
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:58,950
What do they mean?

1198
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,290
Can I take that out of his head?

1199
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:04,570
Um...

1200
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:04,930
Here.

1201
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:06,870
Oh my god, I got his brain.

1202
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:08,530
What is that?

1203
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:12,130
I am entrusting you with my main memory disk.

1204
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,810
You have passed the first test by showing me the book.

1205
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:18,710
Now you will need to find a way to install the backup.

1206
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:20,510
Install the...

1207
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,850
Before you do that, though, someone else is here with you,
right?

1208
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:27,710
Someone aside from Adminto, a resident of this world.

1209
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:30,070
Yeah, the robot lady with the red hair.

1210
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,010
She's in the computer room right now.

1211
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,690
And please do not tell her you found me.

1212
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:35,770
At least not yet.

1213
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,650
She could just walk into the room.

1214
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,450
She could literally walk in here right now.

1215
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,550
Do you remember seeing numbers around?

1216
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:43,590
These?

1217
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:45,530
I don't know.

1218
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:48,490
I can't be seen like this.

1219
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:49,290
What?

1220
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:51,490
You stinky?

1221
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:53,630
Um, okay.

1222
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:55,790
Please help me restore my memory.

1223
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:58,310
Bring the disc back once you have the backup.

1224
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:00,250
Okay.

1225
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:03,790
Avoiding spoilers, so I'm here to say, hi, Mint.

1226
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:06,190
Hello, thanks for the super chat, Leah.

1227
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,970
Profit Bot Zero Backup System 1.0.

1228
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:12,710
Please insert this.

1229
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:13,970
That's a computer.

1230
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:15,630
What is this?

1231
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:20,090
Oh.

1232
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:26,050
Is that Minto?

1233
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:27,430
Minto robot.

1234
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:29,790
And that's the hospital.

1235
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:30,490
I remember that.

1236
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:35,910
I don't know what the electricity one is though.

1237
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:40,270
Residential tracking machine for reference and explanation
of the symbols.

1238
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:43,250
Medical units are assigned to this building.

1239
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:45,890
A robot is assigned to this building.

1240
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:48,850
Okay, literally everybody.

1241
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:53,510
They're shy.

1242
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:54,670
It's shy guy.

1243
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:55,750
Shy guy.

1244
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:57,490
Just like me.

1245
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:59,410
Electricity.

1246
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:00,630
A power cell is assigned to this building.

1247
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:01,270
this building.

1248
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,450
Oh.

1249
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:05,490
Interesting.

1250
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:07,650
Tomatoes are first.

1251
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,150
Ah, thank you.

1252
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:11,870
How's it going?

1253
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:14,490
This observation room isn't for the mines.

1254
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:17,190
I've actually never been to this particular one.

1255
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:18,130
Really?

1256
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:20,290
You recognize it at first, though?

1257
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:21,950
They all look the same.

1258
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:23,190
Fair enough.

1259
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:26,030
I did find something interesting, though.

1260
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,250
All the databases seem to encode video feeds.

1261
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:37,330
Right now, I can see various places in the barons the
outpost the residential areas even my own house they're all

1262
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:52,040
shot from a top-down perspective too wait like like how I'm
looking at the game which means the cameras would have to be

1263
01:19:52,040 --> 01:20:01,280
in the air but I have never seen any cameras around the
drone wait no guys it's the birds oh my

1264
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,940
Oh my god, Lizzie Bird, you have the same idea as me!

1265
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:14,560
Getting kind of meta as if it didn't the first time, huh?

1266
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:15,660
That's kind of spooky.

1267
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,000
I might go investigate later, yeah.

1268
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,100
Did you find anything interesting in the back room?

1269
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,360
You were in there for a while.

1270
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,320
Yeah, we found a dead end?

1271
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:28,740
Happy Friday, man.

1272
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,780
I've seen the base game, but never new game plus.

1273
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,840
Curious to see what's different.

1274
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:44,100

1276
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,760
Freaky Friday, it's Freaky Friday.

1277
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,040
I don't remember what to do.

1278
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,520
I know we have to fix the battery.

1279
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,240
How did I...

1280
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,180
I replaced the glass on it.

1281
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,100
I remember that.

1282
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:42,320
Like, oh, I think we pulled the lens out here.

1283
01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:43,180
And then did I use that?

1284
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,320
bottle to...

1285
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:45,900
Oh wait.

1286
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,110
We got the lens.

1287
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:52,790
We have to find the thing to fix the...

1288
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,260
It's Freaky Friday.

1289
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:02,140
I'm in love.

1290
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:11,740
I'm not sure you need to do that all this time.

1291
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:22,060
But what about um turning on the power and and And...

1292
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:23,780
And...

1293
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:25,480
And...

1294
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:25,900
And stuff.

1295
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:30,640
I don't need to turn the power on it yet.

1296
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,080
Is this a mock desktop or is Mint using Edge 2026?

1297
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,780
Okay, first of all, this is my...

1298
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:44,720
This is my computer for game only.

1299
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,360
So, it's not that I use it.

1300
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,580
Oh, here we go.

1301
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,840
And here's the screwdriver here.

1302
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,060
No, I can't.

1303
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:54,520
We lost the screwdriver.

1304
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,860
There was a...

1305
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:59,160
There was a... There was a pole.

1306
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,120
There was some sort of stick.

1307
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,060
It's not this one.

1308
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:07,680
Where was it?

1309
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:14,780
I don't know if I have to do all of this anymore, but...

1310
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:17,220
They have games on your computer.

1311
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,860
I got games on my computer.

1312
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:32,350
We need to open that so that we can get the battery even
though I'm not sure if I need it or not.

1313
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:33,130
I don't know.

1314
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:37,290
He says just make backups but what does he mean by that?

1315
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:42,810
Stop being so vague I need the hand holding right now!

1316
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:44,930
I need to be handheld.

1317
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:47,650
Wait was there anything in here?

1318
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:03,370
Make babies.

1319
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:06,150
I have for some reason I don't think that's what he meant.

1320
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:09,550
Are you projecting?

1321
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:14,030
Are you projecting?

1322
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:15,470
Ah!

1323
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,970
I found the pipe.

1324
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,450
Yippee!

1325
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,730
Uh, no.

1326
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,790
No walking.

1327
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:27,450
No napping right now, Nico.

1328
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:29,870
Only walking and working.

1329
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:30,770
I'm putting you to...

1330
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,170
Oh no.

1331
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:35,270
There's some weird square stuff.

1332
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:35,790
Oh!

1333
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:38,830
Wait, what's wrong with...

1334
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:39,670
Minto!

1335
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,600
Minto's abstracting.

1336
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,060
Minto bot.

1337
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,720
So sad.

1338
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,540
So sad.

1339
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:12,040
Is this the amazing digital circus?

1340
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:12,540
Yeah.

1341
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,660
It is now.

1342
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,540
Oh wait, uh, oh, sorry.

1343
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:25,420
there we go.

1344
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:28,980
I'm not gonna smash the bottle.

1345
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:29,380
There we go.

1346
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:29,880
Okay.

1347
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:32,000
Oh, the flatten it.

1348
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:32,300
That's right.

1349
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,100
I forgot about that.

1350
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:43,220
I'm kind of been like, I really like amazing digital circus
because I feel like there's enough.

1351
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,340
It's quirky enough.

1352
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:45,700
What?

1353
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:46,360
Oh, whoops.

1354
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:46,980
I went too far.

1355
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:52,220
It's quirky enough, but I don't feel like it's like usually
trying too hard.

1356
01:25:53,800 --> 01:26:03,100
And it's like, it seems just it seems like I can't get into
shows like has been hotel and things like that because I

1357
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:15,860
always feel like like I don't find I don't like stuff where
it's just like ha ha cursing is the punchline that's not

1358
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:31,180
like it's just or like sex joke is the punchline those kinds
of things make it it's just not my my type of humor I'm

1359
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:35,780
really enjoying the way they're handling the story
progression right like I feel like the amazing digital

1360
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:41,320
circus is like you know if you haven't checked it out yet
because you're worried about it being like a husband hotel I

1361
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:53,780
think it's actually not like it at all so um I really
suggest it I really recommend it um and it's it's really

1362
01:26:53,780 --> 01:27:01,140
really good I think the animation is so cute I think like
such a cute character design i love her and and one thing

1363
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:10,820
that i also really like about it is one of my idol oh she's

talk to her about it i'd be like jacks are so cute and she'd

1365
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:23,370
be like yeah i recommend it i really like it

1366
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,680
You like them both?

1367
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,360
Different moods?

1368
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,180
That's totally fair.

1369
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,880
I'm not trying to like...

1370
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,700
I'm not trying to yuck your yum.

1371
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,940
I'm just saying that it's not my cup of tea.

1372
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,180
Which is totally... Okay.

1373
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,880
You like jacks?

1374
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:46,300
My favorite character for Amazing Digital Circus is...

1375
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,620
Kinger my goal?

1376
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,420
I love Kinger.

1377
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,700
I like him all, honestly.

1378
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:23,080
So many people liking Kinger.

1379
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:23,540
Wow.

1380
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,720
Disappearing guy is so funny.

1381
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,880
Guys, I think some people are trying to guess who I'm
talking about as my Oshi.

1382
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,320
You guys are not going to know her.

1383
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:40,180
She's a very indie, indie idol in Japan.

1384
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:42,680
I don't think you know her.

1385
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:45,540
Oshi does not always mean VTuber.

1386
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,640
It's already fully charged.

1387
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,060
Yeah!

1388
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:04,730
Was it here?

1389
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:06,830
Yes.

1390
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:10,210
Big machine.

1391
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:16,930
Oh, oh, I forgot to charge the battery.

1392
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:20,350
It's Ado.

1393
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:21,410
So true.

1394
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:27,190
Yippee!

1395
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:30,950
That's how you charge rechargeable batteries.

1396
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:32,590
So fast, so easy.

1397
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:36,290
All you need is a light bulb and two seconds and it'll
charge.

1398
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:38,930
Whoa!

1399
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:41,490
Alright, it's alive!

1400
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:42,830
Everybody's alive!

1401
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:47,290
The reason I really wanted to do this was because I wanted
to check the computer.

1402
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:48,790
The screen says documents.

1403
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:51,150
I can't seem to make the computer do anything else.

1404
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:53,650
Do I have to go to my own documents for real?

1405
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:55,050
Wait.

1406
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,720
One second?

1407
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,740
Then I go to my own documents for real?

1408
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:05,700
Documents?

1409
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:09,700
Oh wait, that's the wrong thing.

1410
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:15,700
Oh wait, there was this.

1411
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:16,860
Hold on.

1412
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,620
That we got last time.

1413
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:24,080
That was like, it said solstice here.

1414
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,940
But it's called password.

1415
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:39,310
The code you need is 249241.

1416
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,490
Is that what I need?

1417
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:49,000
For the gas mask?

1418
01:30:57,050 --> 01:30:59,610
It was right there the whole time!

1419
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:00,490
Did it know?

1420
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:01,130
Does it know?

1421
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:02,390
Does she know?

1422
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:03,250
Does he know?

1423
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,170
Do they know?

1424
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:08,330
Is it here?

1425
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:14,270
I don't think so.

1426
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:20,350
Oh, here it is.

1427
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,340
Oh, oops, that was too biased.

1428
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:26,720
Okay.

1429
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:33,560
Two, what was it, four, nine, two,

1430
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:41,860
two, four, nine, two, four, one, two, four, one.

1431
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,180
Oh my God!

1432
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:45,760
It worked!

1433
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:49,240
Let's go.

1434
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:51,480
Easy game.

1435
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:55,780
Hey!

1436
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,060
All right, moving over here.

1437
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:08,380
I have to, like, work with two different mice, so it's kind
of freaky.

1438
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,020
Um, I have my ways.

1439
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,080
I see.

1440
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,560
What's in the safe?

1441
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,280
It's a gas mask!

1442
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:19,020
Oh, it's empty.

1443
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:19,400
Oh.

1444
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:22,980
Run away!

1445
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,540
What is that?

1446
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:26,720
Run away!

1447
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,360
Very good, very good.

1448
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,080
do for New Year's.

1449
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,880
You know what one day I want to do you guys?

1450
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:47,540
One day I want to be one of the confetti people for Times
Square.

1451
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:52,520
You got drunk!

1452
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:54,880
Slept.

1453
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:56,200
That's always a good thing.

1454
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:57,480
Catch up on your sleep.

1455
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,600
Watch the VTubers.

1456
01:32:59,160 --> 01:32:59,380
Yeah!

1457
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:00,900
Had lunch with family.

1458
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,320
Worked.

1459
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,980
I was at work.

1460
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:09,420
No.

1461
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,480
Big family gathering.

1462
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,160
Mahjong bingo vtubers.

1463
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,040
Wait, the whole...

1464
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,460
You put vtubers on the big screen?

1465
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,840
Couldn't see fireworks because of thick fog.

1466
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:20,360
No!

1467
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:23,860
You know, I didn't see fireworks either, except in the VR
child.

1468
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,800
Still coming back from Wisdom Teeth, removable Murphy.

1469
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,060
So I did play a bunch of video games.

1470
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,840
Video games.

1471
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:43,370
Uh...

1472
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:46,790
Alright, now we can run around with our mask on.

1473
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:51,450
So I'm trying to not play the game as I did prior.

1474
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:55,190
But I'm also trying to figure out what we do.

1475
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:03,850
You might like the Ram Shackle Pilot and Laksa Daisy if you
haven't seen them for animated shows that are coming up.

1476
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:05,590
Laksa Daisy?

1477
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:08,430
That's the one with the cats in the club, right?

1478
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:11,290
The freaky cats in the club.

1479
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:15,670
Not a lot of fireworks this year because I ran.

1480
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:16,010
No!

1481
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:21,650
Okay, we gotta go find some numbers, everybody.

1482
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:23,170
Let's go find...

1483
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:25,390
Let's go to the dorms and see if there's numbers.

1484
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:28,550
The gangster cats.

1485
01:34:28,890 --> 01:34:30,430
I don't know, Ram Shackle, though.

1486
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:31,510
I'll check that one out.

1487
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:32,350
Thank you, Strider!

1488
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:33,270
Thank you!

1489
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:35,810
Thank you so much for the super chat, too.

1490
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:37,130
I really appreciate it.

1491
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:42,030
Do we see the numbers?

1492
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,320
one do i have to count these maybe

1493
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:21,580

1494
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:28,020
band on youtube unable to send chat messages or super chats
hours of fun hooray PSA for folk support and help with that.

1495
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,280
Why did you get a shadow band?

1496
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:31,320
Oh, I don't know.

1497
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:33,340
You'll see a number.

1498
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:33,980
Okay, okay.

1499
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,140
Thank you.

1500
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:37,700
What do you have to say?

1501
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,880
All of these terminals do not boot.

1502
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:41,600
I'm not sure what to do now.

1503
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:43,960
Oh my gosh, being a robot with no purpose.

1504
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:44,680
So sad.

1505
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,620
Okay, we'll see a number.

1506
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:47,460
We'll see a number.

1507
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,100
I don't see one.

1508
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:12,460
The music is so nice.

1509
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,720
The building has numbers.

1510
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,260
Oh, outside!

1511
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:20,500
Wait, this is 1-1-8.

1512
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,060
Oh, I see!

1513
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:27,540
Hello, hi!

1514
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,360
I am stationed here by yourself?

1515
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:34,740
Okay, so 1-1-8 has a stationed robot.

1516
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:37,140
Okay, hold on, I need a notepad for this.

1517
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:41,060
Open up a third notepad because I have two open already.

1518
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:45,360
1-1-8 equals stationed robot.

1519
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:48,300
Okay.

1520
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,240
Let's go check out...

1521
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:55,680
Well, I guess the other ones don't have the numbers in on
the outside because there was nothing in there.

1522
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:55,960
Wait?

1523
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,420
I'm kidding.

1524
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,020
I'm a liar.

1525
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:01,840
119 has nothing, though.

1526
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,120
Wait, no.

1527
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:04,480
I'm a liar again.

1528
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,300
You guys, I can't stop lying.

1529
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,000
It's like it's my New Year's resolution or something.

1530
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:08,620
This one...

1531
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:12,040
119 has the battery in it.

1532
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:13,340
Battery.

1533
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:17,740
My resolution...

1534
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:18,960
is to gaslight more.

1535
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:20,620
The battery.

1536
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:21,060
Okay.

1537
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:22,820
What was the other one?

1538
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:27,700
Yeah.

1539
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:29,400
Yeah.

1540
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:30,020
Yeah.

1541
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:32,860
This one is 1-1-3.

1542
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,240
And it has...

1543
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,300
1-1-3 empty?

1544
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:55,570
Did it have something?

1545
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,810
I promise that I'd lie more this year.

1546
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:04,230
Okay.

1547
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:05,990
That's exactly me too!

1548
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:08,530
It has nothing.

1549
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:15,300
Got a moribble MM.

1550
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:16,760
Flip it around.

1551
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:18,500
Wicked Witch!

1552
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,600
This one is...

1553
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:22,680
1-1-2.

1554
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:24,620
1-1-2.

1555
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:25,720
Hop it all.

1556
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:27,300
Hop it all.

1557
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:27,880
Hop it all.

1558
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,640
1-1-7.

1559
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:45,760
1-1-7's also empty.

1560
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:04,270
Do the notes give a hint?

1561
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:08,810
Oh my god, I keep pressing too many times.

1562
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:15,080
Looks like we're supposed to pack stuff for evacuation.

1563
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:16,660
I wish these books weren't so heavy.

1564
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:18,440
They're by the author.

1565
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:19,960
Author, I can't throw them away.

1566
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:23,480
Oh, this is the mom.

1567
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:26,800
Love mom.

1568
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:30,400
Alright, so we need...

1569
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:31,960
Four?

1570
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,020
Five, six.

1571
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:36,640
Here?

1572
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:39,100
Zero!

1573
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,280
Okay, we need one.

1574
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:42,080
One.

1575
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,700
One, four, five, six.

1576
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:49,440
No numbers after that.

1577
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:53,720
A robot.

1578
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:54,620
It's beyond repair.

1579
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,940
That has to be a stationed robot, right?

1580
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,560
I think so.

1581
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:03,360

Wait, wait.

01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,680
Ejecting disk.

1600
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:24,780
The numbers, Minky, what do they mean?

1601
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,440
I know what they mean now.

1602
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,060
Please help me restore my memory.

1603
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,820
Bring the disk, the bisque.

1604
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:38,300
Bring me a tomato bisque once you have the backup.

1605
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:39,940
I'm very hungry.

1606
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:43,380
Does this work?

1607
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,180
inserting disk, rebooting.

1608
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:50,440
Ah.

1609
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:52,640
Are you okay?

1610
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:53,660
Sure.

1611
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:55,140
So I guess it worked?

1612
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:55,980
Yes.

1613
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,380
I believe a proper introduction is in order.

1614
01:42:58,900 --> 01:42:59,740
I am the prototype.

1615
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,300
Originally named Prophetbot.

1616
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:06,900
Don't forget the grilled cheese.

1617
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:07,660
Oh yeah.

1618
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:11,700
Some garlic grilled cheese with a tomato bisque.

1619
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:13,760
Oh yeah.

1620
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:16,240
Oh, yeah.

1621
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:21,400
Otherworldly tech doesn't hang out at 100% forever?

1622
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:22,260
Amazing!

1623
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,220
Sonobisk doll mention?

1624
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:27,560
Delicious.

1625
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:33,680
Guys, I realized, I talked about this the other day.

1626
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:37,460
With my last meal of 2026.

1627
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:38,680
No, 2025.

1628
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:41,260
Being pizza rolls?

1629
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:53,960
And then I realized, because I ate right before the collab
but it was already 2026 for me my first meal of 2026 was

1630
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,100
pizza rolls

1631
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:15,860
non-stop pizza rolls what kind of pizza rolls okay here's my
recipe you get the crescent rolls Like they could be like a

1632
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:21,880
Pillsbury or whatever brand, off-brand pizza roll is from
your local grocery.

1633
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:28,280
Just as long as there are crescent rolls, they're like in a,
they're in like a roll, a tube.

1634
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:33,840
The ones are the ones, the ones are the kinds of tubes that
pop and scare you and I don't like them.

1635
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:40,140
But you, you get those and you roll them out and they're in
like little triangles and you peel them apart from the

1636
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:40,840
triangles.

1637
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:43,940
And then there's a big old fat side of the triangle.

1638
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:48,460
And that one you smack on a couple pepperoni.

1639
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:54,060
Like a one pepperoni, two pepperoni, three pepperoni.

1640
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:55,920
I do four pepperoni.

1641
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:57,380
I do four pepperoni.

1642
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,680
And then you get a mozzarella stick, a cheese stick.

1643
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,740
And then you bend that sucker in half.

1644
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:06,080
You tear it into half.

1645
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:08,080
And then you put it on top of the pepperoni.

1646
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:11,020
And then you roll it all together.

1647
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,860
And then you fold in the sides.

1648
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:27,560
And then you get some pizza sauce And you, after you finish
baking them You dip it in the pizza sauce And it's very good

1649
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:43,600
It's quite delicious It's pretty good And you can make a lot
of them Because you get a lot of peploni And you'll get the

1650
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:48,240
mozzarella sticks also comes with a lot Yeah It's yum!

1651
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,120
It's yum!

1652
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:55,680
I was literally writing to call this out the pop when you
did the same bass.

1653
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,400
Also, hi, Brad!

1654
01:45:58,660 --> 01:45:59,300
Welcome back!

1655
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:00,100
Thank you!

1656
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,600
Peploni, peploni.

1657
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:07,340
I had olive garden today.

1658
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:12,120
You got them endless bread roll, bread, bread, endless
bread, bread.

1659
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:16,880
What is... what is a bread...

1660
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:19,120
More olive bread.

1661
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:21,120
What is, how much a bread is...

1662
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:23,040
What kind of bread is it out of the olive garden?

1663
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:23,960
Is it bread sticks?

1664
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:25,600
Binto gaming.

1665
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:26,340
I'm gaming!

1666
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:32,000
I was built to greet the savior of the old world.

1667
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:32,740
Wait.

1668
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,040
A prophet robot.

1669
01:46:34,140 --> 01:46:34,840
Like the one I met?

1670
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,460
Hey, I was right about you guys looking alike.

1671
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:43,340
Well, the prophet bot out there is now a gross
simplification of my design.

1672
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:45,580
Someone's bitter.

1673
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,040
Just bread.

1674
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:56,780
breadsticks oh my gosh one place that we went to in animal
kingdom um it's funny because ashton kept choosing these

1675
01:46:56,780 --> 01:47:09,740
places to eat and they were all like pretty but the first
place we ate at was a restaurant in animal kingdom and at

1676
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:18,160
first she looked at the at the menu and it seemed pretty
good and they had like a bread bread basket and we were like

1677
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:29,020
heck yeah we love a bread basket and guys for the first time
ever there was a I've never heard of this spicy bread why

1678
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:40,480
was the bread spicy shouldn't that be like the non-spicy
part of the meal because it's the thing that will that will

1679
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:55,780
calm your mouth when it's not when it's spicy it was so
strange all of the bread was really bad there was one cheesy

1680
01:47:55,780 --> 01:48:06,720
bread that we were like oh yeah this is gonna be so great it
was it was the best out of all of them but it was like more

1681
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:11,200
of like a mochi texture and then The cheese was not so
cheese.

1682
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,080
It was strange.

1683
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:18,420
I had jalapeno bread from the grocery store.

1684
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:20,880
It was not that, though.

1685
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:22,620
I think it was like a...

1686
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:24,980
I think it was like a...

1687
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:26,540
Like a...

1688
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,520
A flakes of pepper or something, you know.

1689
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:33,020
What's next?

1690
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,060
Spicy milk?

1691
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:35,020
I know.

1692
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:37,040
It was really strange.

1693
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:38,660
Yeah.

1694
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:41,620
Apparently food at Disney is extremely hit or miss.

1695
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,820
We still ate, though.

1696
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:46,160
It was fine.

1697
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:49,580
Anyway, back to the game.

1698
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:52,640
That is to say, he is much more primitive by comparison.

1699
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:55,020
Embarrassingly, so...

1700
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:56,500
Hey, he seemed all right to me.

1701
01:48:57,860 --> 01:48:58,660
You don't understand.

1702
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:05,460
Not only is he not tamed, he was tailor-made for this much
smaller, simpler world to begin with.

1703
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:06,920
I was not.

1704
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:08,960
I was built before the real world.

1705
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:22,440
ended the real world wait what's happening oh right you
don't know nico do you remember the ending dusty dog thank

1706
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:29,800
you so much for the time gifted and optimistic optimistic
welcome to membership thank you wait is this like the ending

1707
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:37,640
i just did excuse me the fact that you found me at all means
this is not your first time in this world wait but the world

1708
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:41,000
shouldn't have ended We saved the world!

1709
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,080
Continuous pizza rolls.

1710
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,080
The game was rigged right from the start.

1711
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:49,940
You have already been summoned to this world once before.

1712
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:54,980
In fact, you've already traversed the entire world and went
through the tower already.

1713
01:49:56,740 --> 01:50:01,940
And in the ending, you either put in the sun or didn't.

1714
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,120
What matters is that you are here now.

1715
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:08,960
Armento has succeeded.

1716
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:12,600
successfully bypassed the one-shot restriction and brought
you back again.

1717
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,780
We eat fried bread with mayo and cheese.

1718
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:17,660
Best thing ever.

1719
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,920
Fried bread sounds crazy.

1720
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:22,360
That sounds so yummy.

1721
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,120
That sounds pretty good.

1722
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:27,740
Lithuania.

1723
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:29,720
I've never tried Lithuania food.

1724
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:34,520
I...

1725
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:35,240
Oh.

1726
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,940
Thought something was weird.

1727
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,700
When I woke up in the house, I called out a name.

1728
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,880
It turned out to be Adminto's name.

1729
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:47,900
And then I back at the other robot.

1730
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:51,800
I even asked Adminto if we met before.

1731
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,160
Felt like such a dumb question at the time.

1732
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:57,640
It looks like you are at least aware of it.

1733
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:00,980
Anything fried is delicious.

1734
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:02,140
Soutre.

1735
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:04,720
To some extent.

1736
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:07,700
It's just this weird feeling, okay?

1737
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:08,960
I don't...

1738
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:11,400
Actually, I remember going through the world.

1739
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:13,080
I just remember I had Minto.

1740
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:15,580
It's really starting to freak me out.

1741
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:20,360
Calm down.

1742
01:51:24,530 --> 01:51:28,530
Look, just like how my memories were locked away, yours are
too.

1743
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:30,590
Thank you for the summertime!

1744
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:34,370
But you're a living being.

1745
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:37,270
You don't even need extra hardware to remember.

1746
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:40,390
Just close your eyes.

1747
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:47,850
focus say that at a country fair not everything should be
fried oh my gosh i've seen like country fair menus and stuff

okra before everything is fried

1750
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:13,730
Fried pickles?

1751
01:52:14,090 --> 01:52:14,590
Wait, wait.

1752
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:15,570
Actually, I like those.

1753
01:52:15,710 --> 01:52:17,390
Wait, those are actually a real thing.

1754
01:52:19,490 --> 01:52:21,070
I like fried pickles.

1755
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:27,810
Fried Twinkies.

1756
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:29,450
I've never had a Twinkie before.

1757
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:32,830
Fried soda.

1758
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:34,310
Fried ice cream.

1759
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:36,150
I've heard of that before too, though.

1760
01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:37,310
It's kind of good.

1761
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:39,830
It's got like a crunchy outside.

1762
01:52:40,470 --> 01:52:41,230
It's kind of yummy.

1763
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:42,690
Hmm.

1764
01:52:45,840 --> 01:53:02,820
Fried mineral water That's like That's Oh wait, fried milk
tea Oh Indian pan fried okra Bindi masala Oh What does an

1765
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:03,840
okra taste like?

1766
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:10,160
I've always never tried it because it scares me Because the
outside looks like it's so hard Like it looks like it's like

1767
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:18,590
a shell That it shouldn't be eaten Oh I don't think you'd
like fried okra.

1768
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:21,070
It's kind of slimy like natto and texture.

1769
01:53:21,490 --> 01:53:22,890
Oh, it's slimy?

1770
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:28,920
Too slimy for me?

1771
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:30,520
Slimy in a good way.

1772
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,020
I don't know guys, I'm not good with the slimy texture.

1773
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:38,960
Hmm.

1774
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:48,800
It's not that different from tomato.

1775
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:49,960
Oh really?

1776
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:51,240
I can eat tomato.

1777
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,620
Slimy and better.

1778
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:54,160
Oh.

1779
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:58,300
When it's fried it's not that slimy I would hope not.

1780
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:01,780
Okay, back to the game.

1781
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:03,780
Just close your eyes and focus.

1782
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:05,180
Focus on what?

1783
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,360
Try to picture a big room made entirely of glass.

1784
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:12,560
Glass.

1785
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,220
Nico, what's this made of?

1786
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:16,380
Glass.

1787
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:26,320
No matter what you saw in the tower, the top room never
changes.

1788
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:27,800
All right.

1789
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:30,640
Nico, what's the tower made of?

1790
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:33,740
Oh!

1791
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:35,100
The elevator!

1792
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:36,940
Oh, yes!

1793
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:39,960
I was all there before.

1794
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,480
No way!

1795
01:54:42,980 --> 01:54:44,500
I was there, wasn't I?

1796
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:45,940
At the tower!

1797
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:49,520
I've been... I've played these games before!

1798
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:52,160
I love Apollo!

1799
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:52,940
Yeah!

1800
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:56,640
I love quoting Apollo.

1801
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:58,920
I've been through the tower.

1802
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,000
There we go.

1803
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:11,960
all that much but the room with the sun it feels like such a
long time ago yeah it was like a couple days ago it doesn't

1804
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:25,720
make sense it was last year Nico I don't know Apollo my top
recommended YouTube channel Apollo Apollo the bird if I

1805
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:32,580
already finished the mission why didn't anything change and
why doesn't anyone know me the other prophet bought the

1806
01:55:32,700 --> 01:55:33,340
robot lady.

1807
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:35,360
None of them remember who I am.

1808
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:36,620
Of course not.

1809
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:38,840
The residents do not have that capacity.

1810
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,200
NPC memories do not last beyond the scope of a session.

1811
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:43,860
NPC?

1812
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:48,060
Bro, you can't just call people

1813
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:51,980
NPCs.

1814
01:55:51,980 --> 01:56:01,840
I feel like being called an NPC, especially by like a
zoomer, is so, it feels so offensive.

1815
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:04,800
I feel a really easy way to rage bait me.

1816
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:11,700
It's like soul, it's...

1817
01:56:19,220 --> 01:56:20,580
It's so...

1818
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:22,180
It makes me so angry.

1819
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,900
SMH, we're all Minto's NPCs.

1820
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:32,200
Getting mad at Zoomers, typical NPC behavior.

1821
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:41,200
mpc is literally calling you not a real person it's messed
up i know i feel like they're erasing my humanity i'm not i

1822
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:52,380
was a former human but i was human it just is bought a
ticket and flight to see you live ramiya thank you does that

1823
01:56:52,380 --> 01:57:02,640
happen to you often be called an mpc no i've never been
called an mpc before but but i've seen people being called

1824
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:06,220
mpcs and i'm like This is so...

1825
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:08,340
It feels too mean.

1826
01:57:10,140 --> 01:57:11,840
It feels so mean.

1827
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,220
You can call me chopped.

1828
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:16,160
You can call me ugly.

1829
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,020
I don't care.

1830
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:18,540
But like...

1831
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:24,880
Every NPC is the pro tag of their own game.

1832
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:27,760
...

1833
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:27,940
...

1834
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:28,080
...

1835
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:28,820
...

1836
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:40,200
Technically, we're all NPCs to each other.

1837
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:44,800
You make your own choices.

1838
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:48,400
Every time I think of it, I think of it as like an oblivion
NPC.

1839
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:49,880
And just someone.

1840
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:52,960
Like they think that I'm like someone that goes cop cop cop
cop cop.

1841
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:55,100
They're running around.

1842
01:57:55,820 --> 01:57:56,180
No!

1843
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:05,480
Stop.

1844
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,280
You violated the law.

1845
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:09,060
But I do that IRL.

1846
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:10,280
Maybe we should.

1847
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:11,560
Maybe I have an NPC.

1848
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:18,060
I'm the NPC of the Matrix.

1849
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:21,440
Everyone else is Neo and I'm the only NPC.

1850
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,860
But also, okay, spin it like this, you guys.

1851
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,720
You're a non-playable character, right?

1852
01:58:30,140 --> 01:58:32,660
Which means no one can ever be you.

1853
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:39,320
If you're an NPC, that means no one can ever be you.

1854
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:40,720
You're your own character.

1855
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:49,920
They came with mods!

1856
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:50,680
No!

1857
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:56,680
So you just spend time thinking about being called an NPC?

1858
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:02,200
Yeah, I'm like creating enemies in my brain.

1859
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,720
Winto is a nearly perfect cute ghost made idol.

1860
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:08,960
Nearly!

1861
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:13,800
Nobody's perfect.

1862
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,260
I gotta work it.

1863
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:17,890
I feel better about...

1864
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:20,980
about NPC-ness now.

1865
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:21,420
Yeah.

1866
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:28,940
It's all about being positive.

1867
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:31,120
You know, the characters.

1868
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:32,580
The world's residents.

1869
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:36,260
NPCs can never recreate Minto's raw energy.

1870
01:59:38,340 --> 01:59:39,620
Like that?

1871
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:45,080
What kind of energy?

1872
01:59:49,970 --> 01:59:50,450
Yeah!

1873
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:59,050
Minto is an NPC naturally pretty cute.

1874
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:04,610
I'm gonna need you all to stop it right now.

1875
02:00:04,970 --> 02:00:06,030
What is this?

1876
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:07,610
What is this?

1877
02:00:07,650 --> 02:00:08,910
A compliment Minto hour?

1878
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:09,290
No!

1879
02:00:10,530 --> 02:00:11,550
It's time to stop.

1880
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:14,770
We're playing a very serious video game.

1881
02:00:16,350 --> 02:00:18,550
And it's time to stop it.

1882
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:26,240
It's time to quit.

1883
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:28,220
It's time to quit it.

1884
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:31,500
DJ, quit that thing.

1885
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:37,430
Had died.

1886
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:40,570
I heard tickets.

1887
02:00:40,630 --> 02:00:41,070
What's happening?

1888
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:42,050
I don't get on Twitter.

1889
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:43,410
Ah, Ward!

1890
02:00:44,290 --> 02:00:47,250
Tickets for my 3D Jazz show.

1891
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:50,330
But unfortunately, the tickets that were for the pre-sale.

1892
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:51,350
I posted about it.

1893
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:52,290
It's not just on Twitter.

1894
02:00:55,970 --> 02:00:58,490
On YouTube, I posted about it too.

1895
02:00:59,090 --> 02:01:00,550
Cute ghost on my computer screen.

1896
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:02,190
You better clean it.

1897
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:04,830
You better run a virus scan.

1898
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:07,190
Okay, back to game.

1899
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:15,440
All their past memories are built into their code, but...

1900
02:01:16,540 --> 02:01:21,240
The characters themselves don't really exist until Adminto
wills it.

1901
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:21,720
Me?

1902
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:25,500
Oh yeah, because I opened the game.

1903
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:29,300
You're right.

1904
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:30,000
Not that.

1905
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:31,520
Now's not the hour.

1906
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:34,180
All hours are for complimenting Minto.

1907
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:35,940
Stop!

1908
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:41,400
Same story for the world itself.

1909
02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:44,960
Doesn't really exist unless Adminto initiates the program.

1910
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:46,220
Oh.

1911
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:49,480
The program?

1912
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:51,460
Oh my gosh, one-shot program.

1913
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:55,340
Zoom in so we can see those cute hearts in your eyes.

1914
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:13,440
Stop looking at me Stop looking at me The world machine Oh A
universe simulator that runs on Admintho's computer Whoa

1915
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:21,820
this is getting crazy Okay the game was already meta before
But it's getting crazy meta We are all in it right now So

1916
02:02:21,820 --> 02:02:27,460
we're not real Oh you are Which is why you're so important.

1917
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:31,680
The biggest flaw of the program is that it cannot be run
independently.

1918
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:37,120
It requires the mental processing abilities of a real person
from another universe.

1919
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:40,300
Oh, I wonder how my cookie clicker is doing.

1920
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:45,440
You got one of those universe machines?

1921
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:47,300
Welcome to Solstice.

1922
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:49,940
Think of it like one of your dreams.

1923
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:53,480
When you wake up, it's gone.

1924
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:59,720
this world has a physical location inside a computer which
ad minto operates

1925
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:10,440
for this year year over this world to continue existing
around you ad minto has to be in constant contact with you

1926
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:19,040
if ad minto ends the program the world will go into a stasis
oh my god don't say constant contact sorry my ol trauma

1927
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:29,900
sorry oh my god oh sorry oh god i almost threw up on don't

1928
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:41,590
welcome to membership thank you welcome back sorry it was a
program i had to use

1929
02:03:46,770 --> 02:03:55,630
does ad minto know this of course from ad minto's
perspective the world machine isn't all that special it's no

1930
02:03:55,630 --> 02:03:59,910
different from other recreational game type software they
may have installed on their computer.

1931
02:04:01,890 --> 02:04:02,750
Hola, Minto!

1932
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:03,630
Hola, V.

1933
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:11,580
They can also regenerate the world as many times as they'd
like now that the restriction is nullified.

1934
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:17,500
Yeah, I have Harvester and Mystery of the Druids.

1935
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:24,380
All of that is consistent with their concept of what a
computer game looks like.

1936
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:28,120
Am I just a game to you?

1937
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,040
The Slack notification sound is your PTSD game.

1938
02:04:31,060 --> 02:04:31,440
trigger.

1939
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:36,280
It's like a...

1940
02:04:39,260 --> 02:04:40,620
How do you do the slack?

1941
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:55,000
It'll ask you to jump programs to a different game.

1942
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:55,960
Oh my god.

1943
02:04:58,580 --> 02:04:59,820
Why am I even here?

1944
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:02,160
What am I supposed to do to save if...

1945
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:04,440
Save if everything is just...

1946
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:07,420
Wait, wait, what am I even supposed to save if everything is
just...

1947
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:07,920
Fake!

1948
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:10,000
Oh, Nico's crying, guys!

1949
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:13,040
Fake is a harsh word, but...

1950
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:18,000
And why did Adminto never tell me anything about any of
this?

1951
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,460
I cannot speak for Adminto.

1952
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:23,760
I just want to go home.

1953
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:27,760
But every time Adminto runs the program, I come back?

1954
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:29,120
Correct.

1955
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:31,900
Is this why I feel like...

1956
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:34,520
Is this why it feels like I haven't been home for so long?

1957
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:35,880
Maybe.

1958
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:38,620
It's my fault now.

1959
02:05:39,340 --> 02:05:43,040
Once you've established a mental link with the world, you
cannot break it unless the world is...

1960
02:05:43,060 --> 02:05:43,520
saved.

1961
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:47,800
But at this point, the world can never be truly saved.

1962
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:50,740
That's...

1963
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:52,200
Wait, what do you mean?

1964
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:53,480
What do you mean by that?

1965
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:56,160
Why would... What am I doing all this for then?

1966
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:59,280
Why would you create a world like...

1967
02:05:59,280 --> 02:05:59,820
Like this?

1968
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:00,940
Wait, what?

1969
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:03,420
Why would you make a world that's duped from the beginning?

1970
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:05,960
Why would you keep bringing me back to it?

1971
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:07,340
Adminto!

1972
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:09,500
Aren't you supposed to be some kind of God?

1973
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:11,020
Oh, wait.

1974
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:12,900
Aren't you supposed to be a kind God?

1975
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:14,700
Wait, I'm some kind of god.

1976
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:21,020
Oh, communication error.

1977
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:22,600
Kind god.

1978
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:24,540
Kind of god.

1979
02:06:27,740 --> 02:06:30,400
Oh, it appears that we have some confusion here.

1980
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:33,600
Minto's a meanie.

1981
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:37,320
Yeah, I'm a meanie.

1982
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:44,080
And Minto did not build the world, Nico.

1983
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:47,400
It was playing the developers.

1984
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:51,180
It's not Adminto's fault.

1985
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:53,880
It's the people called the devs.

1986
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:59,120
Adminto only owns a machine that is able to generate the
world from pre-existing code.

1987
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:00,940
Adminto!

1988
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:01,500
No!

1989
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,720
They actually have fairly limited control of the events.

1990
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:09,020
The world was built by someone else altogether.

1991
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:11,240
Someone you cannot begin to follow.

1992
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:13,340
The devs.

1993
02:07:14,620 --> 02:07:22,860
designed to be futile quests that it is now but too many
things went wrong there's a type of signal disruption that

1994
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:32,300
he never expected it's eating away at the world slowly
rendering it into an unrecognizable mess even if you bring

1995
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:43,460
back the sun it will not go away a virus the square stuff
isn't it i remember those from before then you know what to

1996
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:50,120
watch out for The creator knows what might be causing it,
but there is nothing that he could do.

1997
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:51,700
What was that one game?

1998
02:07:51,820 --> 02:07:54,020
I think it was what called There Is No Game.

1999
02:07:54,500 --> 02:08:01,540
And, like, at the end sequence, there's a video of, like,
the dev actually, like, working on the game or something.

2000
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:06,580
Because that was going to happen, and this we're going to
have, like, we're going to have a Skype call with the dev.

2001
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,580
I got my ticket.

2002
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:10,900
Hello, my operator.

2003
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:11,700
Thank you.

2004
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:12,780
Thank you so much.

2005
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:13,440
Welcome back.

2006
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,120
We're 20 bucks.

2007
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,200
Thank you, thank you.

2008
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:21,300
Yeah, yeah, it was like that, right?

2009
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:25,960
That was pretty funny.

2010
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:27,000
I liked it.

2011
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:27,900
Until now.

2012
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:30,580
You managed to find me, after all.

2013
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,400
You being here was due to his help.

2014
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:37,020
Oh, I guess it has something to do with the journal.

2015
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:38,040
Correct.

2016
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:41,400
Looks like he wants to have one final attempt at fixing it.

2017
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:43,480
And he might need to do it through you.

2018
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:45,200
Oh, cool.

2019
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:47,700
how to get to the Glen.

2020
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,700
Whatever you did in your last session, you should stick with
it for now.

2021
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:51,600
But the...

2022
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:54,720
But the Minto bot was... was blocked over.

2023
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,180
I remember a boat.

2024
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:01,280
More specifically, fixing a robot that drives the boat.

2025
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:05,220
There's a game I could recommend if you like these kind of
metagames.

2026
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:08,280
Doki Doki Literature Club.

2027
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:13,920
Alright, then go do that.

2028
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:16,200
But...

2029
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:18,720
The boat robot has those squares over it.

2030
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:19,300
Yeah, yeah.

2031
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:22,660
Oh, then do whatever you must to find a new boat.

2032
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:26,380
There are plenty of machine parts around the barrens that
can be repurposed.

2033
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:33,590
You seem enthusiastic.

2034
02:09:35,930 --> 02:09:37,270
That was sarcasm.

2035
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:42,290
Knowing everything isn't real, really does make it feel
pointless.

2036
02:09:43,290 --> 02:09:44,890
But you do want to go home, right?

2037
02:09:45,430 --> 02:09:49,190
Yeah, but how will I know that this isn't just another...

2038
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:51,130
session might be the last one.

2039
02:09:51,190 --> 02:09:54,910
Actually, it is the last one because I'm finishing the game
today.

2040
02:09:56,950 --> 02:10:01,990
The creator is mobilizing things, throwing everything into
this one last shot.

2041
02:10:02,130 --> 02:10:04,230
Oh my gosh, it's not one shot anymore.

2042
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:05,910
It's one last shot.

2043
02:10:06,290 --> 02:10:07,290
Wait, that's kind of awesome.

2044
02:10:08,550 --> 02:10:13,630
There might not be enough internal resources left for
Adminto to be able to generate another session after this.

2045
02:10:16,050 --> 02:10:17,610
Just go find a new boat for now.

2046
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:19,370
But please be careful.

2047
02:10:20,050 --> 02:10:21,030
What about you?

2048
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:23,530
I will meet you at the docks later.

2049
02:10:24,410 --> 02:10:25,790
Need to take care of something first.

2050
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:28,150
Oh!

2051
02:10:28,770 --> 02:10:29,370
Uh-oh.

2052
02:10:29,970 --> 02:10:30,870
Hey, you okay in there?

2053
02:10:32,130 --> 02:10:35,850
I did what I could with the terminals for now, and...

2054
02:10:36,510 --> 02:10:37,310
It's you.

2055
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:42,270
Admin, though, can't afford more RAM for more sessions.

2056
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:45,430
It's too real.

2057
02:10:45,550 --> 02:10:45,950
Stop.

2058
02:10:46,770 --> 02:10:48,910
That would have been a cool, a good sequel name.

2059
02:10:52,170 --> 02:10:58,010
yeah you're the robot that insisted on living in the mines
are you not my friend told me to keep an eye out for you

2060
02:10:58,010 --> 02:11:09,290
should we ever cross paths is it clean up his internet
history first likewise your friend gave you something the

2061
02:11:09,290 --> 02:11:17,410
last time you saw each other can you show me what it is wait
you know about the amber I just asked to see it didn't I

2062
02:11:17,410 --> 02:11:21,790
okay Smarty pants.

2063
02:11:23,570 --> 02:11:24,510
Alright, here it is.

2064
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:29,760
Not so.

2065
02:11:30,940 --> 02:11:34,120
He seemed to trust you, so I will treat you as an ally as
well.

2066
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:36,740
Please listen carefully.

2067
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:39,280
Oh, because they both have the Clover symbol, I probably.

2068
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:40,660
Listen carefully.

2069
02:11:41,580 --> 02:11:44,920
You need to escort the Messiah for the remainder of the
barons.

2070
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:49,600
I predict a high concentration of square particle
disruptions in the near future.

2071
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:51,460
No way.

2072
02:11:51,660 --> 02:11:52,740
Oh my gosh, wait, what's going to happen to you?

2073
02:11:52,760 --> 02:12:01,720
thought this prophet bought yes way it's likely that
structures in the vicinity of the Messiah might be affected

2074
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:13,880
making it far more treacherous pilgrimage than the previous
oh or expectations Aminto and the Messiah need all the extra

2075
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:23,560
help they can get rid of understood wait why can't they join
us for the whole journey though okay Guess we should head

2076
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:24,240
back soon.

2077
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,700
Even without the squares, the mines are not a safe place to
be.

2078
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:29,540
Come on, I'll wait for you outside.

2079
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,280
Wait, you literally have to escort me.

2080
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:33,760
Don't go ahead of me.

2081
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:35,140
I want to ask you.

2082
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:37,220
Rude?

2083
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:38,440
She left.

2084
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:43,380
If you were going to ask her about being not real, save your
breath.

2085
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:46,180
None of the people here know their predicament.

2086
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:50,340
In fact, I don't think they can even comprehend it.

2087
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:55,640
interest to just pretend like we never had this
conversation.

2088
02:12:56,600 --> 02:13:00,920
Causing mass confusion in this world's residence would
likely result in unfavorable conditions for you.

2089
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:02,540
Predicament.

2090
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:04,600
She is real to me.

2091
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:06,700
Yeah, stop saying that about my waifu.

2092
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:11,760
Koharu knows I exist.

2093
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:12,460
She's real.

2094
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:14,860
She calls me Sensei every day.

2095
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:17,400
All right.

2096
02:13:18,380 --> 02:13:19,180
Wait, what about you?

2097
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:21,320
How did you know?

2098
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:24,100
We never had this conversation, remember?

2099
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:28,260
Wait, can I ask?

2100
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:29,760
Can I talk to him one more time?

2101
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:32,720
Trying to establish connection here.

2102
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:33,540
Sorry.

2103
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:35,840
True!

2104
02:13:39,620 --> 02:13:40,820
Come on, let's go back.

2105
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:45,060
I remember it.

2106
02:13:45,460 --> 02:13:46,560
What happened in the tower?

2107
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:48,100
What is spooky music for?

2108
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:52,440
What I tried to do and how you managed to see through it
all.

2109
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:55,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, I definitely did that.

2110
02:13:57,380 --> 02:13:59,040
We have been through all of this.

2111
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:03,480
Even though it was only supposed to run once, you still
managed to come back.

2112
02:14:05,140 --> 02:14:06,140
How did you come back?

2113
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,420
How did you bring Nico back?

2114
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:12,480
And then you even managed to break out of bonds.

2115
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,460
Oh, not bonds, sorry, bounds.

2116
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:19,560
Sorry.

2117
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:29,000
Bringing Nico to places that should have, that never should
have been.

2118
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:38,410
James Bond's.

2119
02:14:39,090 --> 02:14:40,050
I'm Bond's.

2120
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:43,270
James Bond's.

2121
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:47,570
It was him, wasn't it?

2122
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:52,710
And now, now, Nico is upset.

2123
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:56,570
What even happened in that room back there?

2124
02:14:57,430 --> 02:14:58,370
What did Nico learn?

2125
02:14:59,730 --> 02:15:00,450
Nico is upset.

2126
02:15:01,070 --> 02:15:02,310
I can feel it.

2127
02:15:03,690 --> 02:15:05,310
I told you to turn back, Adminto.

2128
02:15:06,050 --> 02:15:08,250
But you've chosen to trust that man instead of me.

2129
02:15:09,850 --> 02:15:11,010
No, not even that.

2130
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:12,850
Just his book.

2131
02:15:13,790 --> 02:15:15,030
His ghost!

2132
02:15:17,050 --> 02:15:18,970
This world is not real.

2133
02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:21,950
You joke.

2134
02:15:22,730 --> 02:15:24,030
You joked the...

2135
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:24,550
You...

2136
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:27,190
Wait, you broke the James box.

2137
02:15:27,550 --> 02:15:28,970
I can't even...

2138
02:15:28,970 --> 02:15:30,710
I can't even read a comment.

2139
02:15:33,810 --> 02:15:35,090
You just...

2140
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:40,240
Sorry, a serious moment.

2141
02:15:40,360 --> 02:15:40,880
Serious moment.

2142
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:42,760
The people are not real.

2143
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:45,120
Nico is upset.

2144
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:46,540
Nico is...

2145
02:15:47,580 --> 02:15:48,460
No, no, no, no, no.

2146
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:52,480
Everything is...

2147
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:52,880
Wrong!

2148
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:02,340
Silver walked over, like nothing was wrong.

2149
02:16:02,520 --> 02:16:06,000
The slowest, so unconcerned.

2150
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:07,540
The minecart.

2151
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:11,860
Earthquake?

2152
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:15,600
The tunnel back out just collapsed.

2153
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:16,680
No.

2154
02:16:17,260 --> 02:16:18,120
What are we gonna do?

2155
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:20,480
I... wait.

2156
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:24,060
The exit just caved, didn't it?

2157
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:25,780
I already know.

2158
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:29,840
I saw this coming, but this is a bit more sudden than I
anticipated.

2159
02:16:30,680 --> 02:16:34,680
Both of you follow me where to the way out

2160
02:16:39,370 --> 02:16:56,330
Mysterious Hello all of us are here a way out There is an
emergency exit behind my computer terminal We did not want

2161
02:16:56,330 --> 02:16:59,210
anyone to stumble upon this route so the terminal has been
weighed down

2162
02:17:02,510 --> 02:17:12,790
It cannot be moved by normal means But with our combined
effort, it might budge Maybe I am not strong I'm not that

2163
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:18,510
strong either If that doesn't work, we might need to dig
around it And you could have just asked

2164
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,040
So sexy

2165
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:34,520
That's a very different game What a way out That's with the
guys That's the guys Sorry, that's the guy's in jail, right?

2166
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:35,840
Come on.

2167
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:37,780
Show off.

2168
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:39,220
Oh my gosh.

2169
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:41,340
She just got, she just fixed it for you.

2170
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:47,240
I would appreciate it if you do not linger here.

2171
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:47,960
Okay.

2172
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:50,960
I linger.

2173
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:58,540
I'm just a fool.

2174
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:00,460
I'm just a fool.

2175
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:02,040
I don't know.

2176
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:19,040
Come in through to you You know I'm just a fool for you You
got me rubbed around your finger Do you have to let it

2177
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:19,760
linger?

2178
02:18:20,060 --> 02:18:21,140
Do you have to?

2179
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:22,140
Do you have to?

2180
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:24,240
Do you have to let it linger?

2181
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,200
I don't even know where this tunnel leads.

2182
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:29,600
This is a way out?

2183
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:31,300
No, this is one shot.

2184
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:35,340
There wasn't any data on this path in the server room.

2185
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:36,560
It's new.

2186
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,980
Miko, get in the Minecraft cart.

2187
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:39,400
Sorry.

2188
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:41,420
Okay.

2189
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:43,160
Get in the Minecraft.

2190
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:47,740
Alright, guys.

2191
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:48,460
Keep up.

2192
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:49,500
Uh-oh.

2193
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:50,960
My droid.

2194
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:53,480
I really did.

2195
02:18:54,340 --> 02:18:55,460
But I...

2196
02:18:57,720 --> 02:18:59,480
De-stabilizing.

2197
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,440
I'm sorry, Miko.

2198
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:12,840
I tried to protect you But can't hold off forever

2199
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:18,660
What was that?

2200
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:20,220
Here too?

2201
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:21,280
Watch out!

2202
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:23,240
Ah!

2203
02:19:31,430 --> 02:19:32,030
Silver!

2204
02:19:33,230 --> 02:19:33,790
Are you okay?

2205
02:19:34,590 --> 02:19:35,710
I'm fine, I'm fine.

2206
02:19:36,470 --> 02:19:38,590
I can still hold it up, but you two need to.

2207
02:19:38,810 --> 02:19:42,170
Ew, robot!

2208
02:19:43,910 --> 02:19:44,850
What are you waiting for?

2209
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:46,810
Take the child and get out!

2210
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:55,790
Oh, she's sacrificing herself.

2211
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:06,070
Literally walking away.

2212
02:20:06,310 --> 02:20:07,890
No urgency whatsoever.

2213
02:20:12,490 --> 02:20:12,790
Ah!

2214
02:20:13,430 --> 02:20:13,910
No!

2215
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:15,050
What do we do?

2216
02:20:17,110 --> 02:20:18,750
You have to take this.

2217
02:20:19,730 --> 02:20:20,070
What?

2218
02:20:20,790 --> 02:20:21,850
The memory disc end?

2219
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:27,690
This is where we part ways.

2220
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:29,350
Just walk around it.

2221
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:32,110
He just walks away.

2222
02:20:32,690 --> 02:20:33,730
Yeah, taking a stroll.

2223
02:20:35,950 --> 02:20:36,930
You go the path ahead.

2224
02:20:37,230 --> 02:20:38,170
We'll lead you to the Glen.

2225
02:20:38,550 --> 02:20:39,590
Right by the city gate.

2226
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:42,450
When you're in the city, go find someone named Cedric.

2227
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:43,850
Give him the disc.

2228
02:20:44,690 --> 02:20:46,150
Well, what happens if I...

2229
02:20:46,150 --> 02:20:46,990
What if the squares?

2230
02:20:47,630 --> 02:20:47,970
Hurry!

2231
02:20:51,230 --> 02:20:52,730
Just chugging along.

2232
02:20:53,330 --> 02:20:54,170
Lally, dally, dally.

2233
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:02,710
Don't forget the mission.

2234
02:21:07,410 --> 02:21:11,790
Adminto, I don't understand the world.

2235
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:14,830
The prophet bought what he was saying.

2236
02:21:15,610 --> 02:21:17,250
Is the world really just...

2237
02:21:18,270 --> 02:21:18,830
Just...

2238
02:21:18,830 --> 02:21:19,290
Is it?

2239
02:21:23,560 --> 02:21:24,400
I don't...

2240
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:26,940
I mean, who am I to say that it's fake?

2241
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:27,580
I don't know.

2242
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:35,740
Be honest.

2243
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:39,820
It's real if it means something to you.

2244
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:41,080
That's how I feel, right?

2245
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:45,400
I mean, it's real in that I'm playing this right now.

2246
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:48,040
If it didn't exist, I wouldn't be playing the game.

2247
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:52,460
Yes, but no?

2248
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:54,080
Yeah, it's complicated.

2249
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:56,960
It's not one set answer, I feel.

2250
02:21:58,300 --> 02:21:58,700
Right.

2251
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:02,860
You're real to us, me.

2252
02:22:03,020 --> 02:22:04,760
Wait, it's not about me.

2253
02:22:08,660 --> 02:22:10,120
Constructed doesn't mean fake.

2254
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:11,100
Yeah, right.

2255
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:14,800
I think that's not lying if I say no.

2256
02:22:18,940 --> 02:22:20,260
You're just saying that.

2257
02:22:21,100 --> 02:22:24,040
Normally, I wouldn't believe it, but it just adds up.

2258
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:25,940
Everything adds up.

2259
02:22:29,570 --> 02:22:31,410
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

2260
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:34,090
If I can't fix the world, I can't go back home.

2261
02:22:34,630 --> 02:22:36,490
But the world is already so messed up.

2262
02:22:37,690 --> 02:22:41,790
don't get fixed what will happen to the world where would i
even go

2263
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:54,000
nico so sad sad nico with the ripe old

2264
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:11,130
sad sad sad in the lord sad sad oh my god sad

2265
02:23:22,750 --> 02:23:24,610
Oh, poor baby!

2266
02:23:27,350 --> 02:23:27,990
Oops, sorry.

2267
02:23:32,150 --> 02:23:34,050
I think, therefore I am.

2268
02:23:34,610 --> 02:23:35,370
Yeah, exactly.

2269
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:40,160
We're looking for Cedric.

2270
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:43,900
I think I remember something.

2271
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:45,920
I remember what I did at the end.

2272
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:47,840
I remember putting in the sun.

2273
02:23:49,060 --> 02:23:50,420
And then everything got really bright.

2274
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:53,560
I don't remember a lot of the details.

2275
02:23:55,460 --> 02:23:57,300
But none of it matters now, does it?

2276
02:23:58,940 --> 02:24:01,340
I just got brought back anyway.

2277
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,220
Oh, we're back here!

2278
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,500
Part of the ground is missing.

2279
02:24:14,220 --> 02:24:16,040
I wonder if it's safe to walk across these vines.

2280
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,160
One way to find out, I guess.

2281
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:18,820
Oh!

2282
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:20,480
They're safe.

2283
02:24:21,580 --> 02:24:22,500
Cool, we learned.

2284
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:23,900
Wait, what's on the other side, though?

2285
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:26,420
Why are you doing this?

2286
02:24:26,440 --> 02:24:27,400
I don't want to!

2287
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:29,840
I don't mean to.

2288
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,560
Maybe I'm a little evil.

2289
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:37,840
Square.

2290
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:41,360
That's the city gate, yeah!

2291
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:43,440
It's...

2292
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:43,880
Uh-oh.

2293
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:48,780
Oh my god, there's so many...

2294
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:50,100
Oh, can I not walk on this?

2295
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:51,780
Are you okay?

2296
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:54,280
Please do not approach.

2297
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:58,280
The gate is closed until further notice.

2298
02:24:58,960 --> 02:24:59,520
No!

2299
02:25:00,140 --> 02:25:00,160
No!

2300
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:02,000
It's so sad!

2301
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:09,000
Now we're navigating the world with all this going on.

2302
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:12,730
The bridge is broken.

2303
02:25:18,890 --> 02:25:19,680
Oh, over here?

2304
02:25:21,150 --> 02:25:21,510
No?

2305
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,010
Was there anything I could cross?

2306
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:34,220
Am I blind?

2307
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:38,440
There was another door.

2308
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:39,940
There was?

2309
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:42,540
This one?

2310
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:46,880
Because this is the bed.

2311
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:51,900
Earlier.

2312
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:53,400
Oh, there was.

2313
02:25:54,860 --> 02:25:56,280
I missed it.

2314
02:25:58,020 --> 02:25:59,180
Not this one, right?

2315
02:25:59,400 --> 02:25:59,620
No.

2316
02:26:04,780 --> 02:26:05,680
Oh, this one!

2317
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:08,280
Hello!

2318
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:10,840
A deeper ruins are ahead.

2319
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:12,680
Do note that they are partially flooded.

2320
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:13,120
Oh, yeah.

2321
02:26:13,740 --> 02:26:15,300
This is where those kids live.

2322
02:26:27,010 --> 02:26:27,550
Square.

2323
02:26:28,230 --> 02:26:29,130
More of those squares.

2324
02:26:31,130 --> 02:26:33,670
This is what they meant with Be There or Be Square.

2325
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:38,220
Being square.

2326
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:44,820
Actually, the only time people have wanted to be square is
for the Minecraft movie.

2327
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:48,660
Why didn't they allow them to be square?

2328
02:26:49,580 --> 02:26:53,020
Why did we actually have like real life Jack Black?

2329
02:26:57,780 --> 02:26:59,660
What about SpongeBob?

2330
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:01,840
That guy's all square.

2331
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:03,740
Square pants.

2332
02:27:07,790 --> 02:27:08,550
What is this way?

2333
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:10,490
Oh, this is...

2334
02:27:10,490 --> 02:27:11,510
I wonder if she's here.

2335
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:18,350
It's hip to be square.

2336
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:21,430
Savior.

2337
02:27:22,850 --> 02:27:24,010
You're here to see me?

2338
02:27:25,110 --> 02:27:25,990
What happened to you?

2339
02:27:27,450 --> 02:27:28,570
Hold on.

2340
02:27:29,330 --> 02:27:30,610
I need to concentrate.

2341
02:27:34,650 --> 02:27:37,870
The islands will collapse if I don't do something.

2342
02:27:38,590 --> 02:27:40,530
That's why the vines...

2343
02:27:40,530 --> 02:27:41,270
Oh my gosh!

2344
02:27:41,470 --> 02:27:42,870
Wait, the islands are collapsing!

2345
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:50,980
The same reason why we had live-action Scooby-Doo movies
apparently.

2346
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:52,800
But Scooby-Doo was never square.

2347
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:55,360
Minecraft has always been square block.

2348
02:28:03,530 --> 02:28:13,250
grow is that why there are vines everywhere are you trying
to hold the land together my powers the best I could do yes

2349
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:23,950
that's should I leave the Sun here for you I know you wanted
to see it tempting but I mustn't the Sun brings me comfort

2350
02:28:23,950 --> 02:28:35,030
but stress is good for this fear is good makes me strong
vines grow If I'm at ease, the vines might retreat.

2351
02:28:36,830 --> 02:28:38,090
They're all in danger, Savior.

2352
02:28:39,330 --> 02:28:40,550
The villagers, the children.

2353
02:28:41,590 --> 02:28:42,630
My final hours.

2354
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:44,310
Mustn't go to waste.

2355
02:28:47,330 --> 02:28:51,310
David Hasselhoff was real in the Spudgebob movie.

2356
02:28:54,670 --> 02:28:54,870
Yeah.

2357
02:28:55,930 --> 02:28:57,750
You're not wrong there.

2358
02:28:58,110 --> 02:28:59,350
Like I was in a movie.

2359
02:29:02,990 --> 02:29:06,930
The people deserve to live even if just for another day.

2360
02:29:07,170 --> 02:29:07,190
Oh!

2361
02:29:12,690 --> 02:29:13,830
Do not worry.

2362
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:14,810
I am fine.

2363
02:29:27,870 --> 02:29:29,850
Everything is bad in this.

2364
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:30,850
Oh my gosh.

2365
02:29:38,650 --> 02:29:39,110
Kick it!

2366
02:29:39,310 --> 02:29:40,270
The pathway is blocked.

2367
02:29:40,570 --> 02:29:41,130
By blocks!

2368
02:29:42,610 --> 02:29:43,730
Wait a minute.

2369
02:29:44,150 --> 02:29:45,290
I remember something about this.

2370
02:29:45,510 --> 02:29:46,030
Yeah!

2371
02:29:47,310 --> 02:29:49,030
Never knew it'd be so easy.

2372
02:29:49,150 --> 02:29:50,990
Look at that little smile.

2373
02:29:52,970 --> 02:29:54,490
ow my foot ow

2374
02:29:59,350 --> 02:30:10,050

wasn't expecting it to happen so soon oh geez hold on my

2375
02:30:10,050 --> 02:30:14,230
second eyes I'm gonna do a throat mint real quick because my
throat's been like so flimmy

2376
02:30:18,090 --> 02:30:31,490

2377
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:40,070

2378
02:30:47,340 --> 02:30:56,240

squares they're way more than before even the gates of the

2379
02:30:56,240 --> 02:31:00,460
refuge is destroyed now That didn't happen last time.

2380
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:01,320
Last time?

2381
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:05,140
Awkward.

2382
02:31:06,620 --> 02:31:07,220
Nothing!

2383
02:31:09,340 --> 02:31:10,640
Almost let that slip on me too.

2384
02:31:11,540 --> 02:31:13,220
Guess I should introduce myself again.

2385
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:14,300
My name is Nico.

2386
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:15,920
Nico.

2387
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:17,940
Nico.

2388
02:31:23,700 --> 02:31:26,080
Oh gosh, would it not be rude to call you by name?

2389
02:31:31,010 --> 02:31:31,750
No worries.

2390
02:31:32,750 --> 02:31:33,350
Calamus?

2391
02:31:34,270 --> 02:31:35,410
How did you know my name?

2392
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:38,050
I didn't even remember his name.

2393
02:31:38,170 --> 02:31:38,790
Oh my gosh.

2394
02:31:40,410 --> 02:31:41,790
Nico's spoiling everything.

2395
02:31:42,610 --> 02:31:43,070
Not again.

2396
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:45,930
The Messiah just knows these things, Kalamas.

2397
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:47,210
Right?

2398
02:31:47,890 --> 02:31:49,170
Yes, of course.

2399
02:31:50,390 --> 02:31:50,670
Phew.

2400
02:31:52,590 --> 02:31:54,430
Don't tell Nico anything ever.

2401
02:31:55,590 --> 02:31:56,930
That is supposed to be a secret.

2402
02:32:00,130 --> 02:32:01,310
Don't tell...

2403
02:32:01,310 --> 02:32:03,950
Don't tell Nico anything ever.

2404
02:32:06,110 --> 02:32:07,490
You were saying about the gate?

2405
02:32:08,090 --> 02:32:08,470
Oh, right.

2406
02:32:08,970 --> 02:32:11,370
Looks like I can't get in the city through the old gate
anymore.

2407
02:32:12,430 --> 02:32:13,910
Do either of you know another way to get in?

2408
02:32:16,370 --> 02:32:17,130
I remember.

2409
02:32:17,490 --> 02:32:21,110
I mean, I heard that there's some sort of hidden passage
around here somewhere.

2410
02:32:21,810 --> 02:32:23,830
Oh, a passage to the burial grounds.

2411
02:32:25,110 --> 02:32:25,830
That's the one.

2412
02:32:26,610 --> 02:32:28,590
But I'm not sure if that'll be of any use here.

2413
02:32:30,310 --> 02:32:32,550
It's been flooded for a long time and there's no boat.

2414
02:32:32,630 --> 02:32:33,150
Oh, my gosh.

2415
02:32:33,210 --> 02:32:34,250
We're probably going to...

2416
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:37,810
We're probably gonna wheel the boat with the book again.

2417
02:32:39,770 --> 02:32:41,390
Cannibalism came up at the Christmas party.

2418
02:32:41,550 --> 02:32:42,450
I was out on Sunday.

2419
02:32:42,850 --> 02:32:44,270
Made me think of you.

2420
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:52,040
What do you mean?

2421
02:32:55,620 --> 02:32:56,880
Why are...

2422
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:59,100
I mean...

2423
02:33:01,340 --> 02:33:02,620
I don't...

2424
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:05,740
Entirely mind that you think of me.

2425
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:09,500
But...

2426
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:11,520
That's your brand now, Minto.

2427
02:33:16,150 --> 02:33:18,090
What's another cannibalism game I can play?

2428
02:33:18,510 --> 02:33:19,430
Red Dead Redemption?

2429
02:33:26,810 --> 02:33:28,690
Yeah, what kind of party were you at?

2430
02:33:28,750 --> 02:33:29,670
Christmas party?

2431
02:33:31,390 --> 02:33:32,470
With cannibalism?

2432
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:37,320
Kind of awesome.

2433
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:41,400
There's cannibalism and Red Dead Redemption?

2434
02:33:41,860 --> 02:33:43,860
There is, uh...

2435
02:33:44,380 --> 02:33:48,340
There's like a few like creepy homes and stuff you can go
to.

2436
02:33:49,160 --> 02:33:49,980
Oh, the forest!

2437
02:33:50,260 --> 02:33:51,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2438
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:52,900
The forest.

2439
02:33:54,220 --> 02:33:55,580
The Donner Party?

2440
02:33:55,740 --> 02:33:57,180
Is there a Donner Party game?

2441
02:33:57,300 --> 02:33:58,280
There has to be.

2442
02:34:06,570 --> 02:34:09,890
Not to mention the burial grounds itself is pretty far from
the city.

2443
02:34:10,970 --> 02:34:11,890
The forest.

2444
02:34:12,990 --> 02:34:13,910
The forest.

2445
02:34:15,830 --> 02:34:17,810
That game is, I guess it is cannibalism.

2446
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:22,590
but they got like freaky leggy monsters and stuff

2447
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:38,000
the night folk in Red Dead 2 scare me I've seen so many like
clips of Red Dead Redemption I don't know anything about the

2448
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:44,600
story I know one thing that might be a spoiler but

2449
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:54,680
I know so much about about like some of the The more
creepier things in it.

2450
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:01,140
It's long.

2451
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,810
Yeah, that's the one thing that stops me from playing it.

2452
02:35:08,470 --> 02:35:14,830
Convo had something to do with little kids crying about
non-kids sections at books or being adult books.

2453
02:35:15,250 --> 02:35:16,750
Somehow that led to cannibalism.

2454
02:35:17,090 --> 02:35:21,070
Is it because cannibalism is not for children, maybe?

2455
02:35:27,070 --> 02:35:35,610
Human monsters in the forest That's so true I've played the
forest And you do eat people I've eaten people in the forest

2456
02:35:35,610 --> 02:35:42,370
Gosh maybe I really have A lot of cannibalism in my history

2457
02:35:45,770 --> 02:36:00,910
Silly the game or irl forest yeah i'm back in my backyard of
the forest i'm in my forest backyard and i'm i'm just

2458
02:36:00,910 --> 02:36:02,350
cannibalizing everything

2459
02:36:06,390 --> 02:36:15,390
no you want to know what i saw in my backyard yesterday a
pysum yeah I saw Paisa!

2460
02:36:16,110 --> 02:36:17,530
It was so cute!

2461
02:36:20,030 --> 02:36:21,350
That's not cannibalism.

2462
02:36:21,490 --> 02:36:22,700
I also wouldn't eat that guy.

2463
02:36:28,370 --> 02:36:30,030
Bigfoot, I wish.

2464
02:36:32,830 --> 02:36:38,830
Would you guys believe me if I was like, my home is the home
of Bigfoot?

2465
02:36:44,320 --> 02:36:46,320
They eat ticks and bad stuff.

2466
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:47,300
Possums are the best.

2467
02:36:50,160 --> 02:36:51,000
For sure.

2468
02:36:53,020 --> 02:36:54,560
Boo, here she comes.

2469
02:36:54,900 --> 02:36:56,440
Watch out, I boo, she'll chew you up.

2470
02:36:56,440 --> 02:36:56,660
Oh, wait.

2471
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:58,160
Wait, oh, what's that song?

2472
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:01,680
Watch out, I boo, she'll chew you up.

2473
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:06,600
She's a man eater.

2474
02:37:08,980 --> 02:37:10,000
Okay, back to game.

2475
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:12,260
I would still like to see it.

2476
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:23,280
we have all right in that case please follow us the good
thing that's not blocked by the blocks minecraft taking over

2477
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:33,360
the game is like play minecraft right now play minecraft
right now at least the courtyard is unaffected for now we

2478
02:37:33,360 --> 02:37:39,660
usually get to the burial grounds through our friend but he
hasn't been here in forever normally this courtyard would be

2479
02:37:39,660 --> 02:37:45,280
where we meet up i hope he comes back soon Is this it?

2480
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:45,580
Yeah.

2481
02:37:46,400 --> 02:37:47,140
One second, though?

2482
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:48,000
Ball.

2483
02:37:48,660 --> 02:37:49,220
It's a ball.

2484
02:37:50,580 --> 02:37:51,140
That's mine.

2485
02:37:51,300 --> 02:37:53,380
It doesn't bounce as much as it used to, though.

2486
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:58,220
Eat to let Minto eat you.

2487
02:38:07,070 --> 02:38:07,570
Possum.

2488
02:38:08,810 --> 02:38:10,330
I think I see it.

2489
02:38:11,810 --> 02:38:12,970
Wait, why does it have a beak?

2490
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:16,830
Why does it got a beak?

2491
02:38:19,870 --> 02:38:20,330
Maybe.

2492
02:38:23,450 --> 02:38:24,670
Is that him?

2493
02:38:25,410 --> 02:38:26,930
Oh my god, I saw him.

2494
02:38:27,690 --> 02:38:27,830
Tiko!

2495
02:38:28,530 --> 02:38:29,390
Niko, what's wrong?

2496
02:38:29,910 --> 02:38:31,130
You looked like you were about to faint.

2497
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:35,710
It's not the first time that's happened.

2498
02:38:36,890 --> 02:38:37,470
Oh my god.

2499
02:38:38,190 --> 02:38:38,890
Walter White.

2500
02:38:40,250 --> 02:38:43,450
Earlier I was in the barons and I saw something like this
too.

2501
02:38:45,450 --> 02:38:48,070
It was like a dream, but only for a split second.

2502
02:38:48,770 --> 02:38:49,870
Sounds like a vision.

2503
02:38:50,890 --> 02:38:52,140
Like something a prophet would see.

2504
02:38:53,030 --> 02:38:53,950
I guess.

2505
02:38:54,830 --> 02:38:56,910
Oh my god, that looks like a possum.

2506
02:38:57,170 --> 02:38:58,770
Yes, that looks so good.

2507
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:07,760
The robot lady I was with earlier had a fancy word for it
though.

2508
02:39:08,340 --> 02:39:08,840
Hallucination?

2509
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:09,580
Wait.

2510
02:39:10,420 --> 02:39:11,200
Let me check something.

2511
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:13,740
Time to whip out my book, baby.

2512
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:15,440
It's glowing.

2513
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:19,100
Oh, I was right.

2514
02:39:19,620 --> 02:39:19,880
Huh?

2515
02:39:20,820 --> 02:39:24,180
When I had the vision back at the Barrens, the book started
glowing too.

2516
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:27,780
I wanted to see if I could get it to happen again, and...

2517
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:28,740
Where did you get that?

2518
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:31,580
Oh, I had it with me when I woke up in this world.

2519
02:39:32,260 --> 02:39:33,660
It looks like one of our friends' books.

2520
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:35,140
Except it's glowing.

2521
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:37,360
That's what the lady said, too.

2522
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:43,440
Nice book.

2523
02:39:43,960 --> 02:39:44,440
Thank you.

2524
02:39:45,580 --> 02:39:47,900
Armino, let's see if we can do anything with the journal in
this room.

2525
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:54,830
Maybe here?

2526
02:39:55,030 --> 02:39:55,770
On the clover?

2527
02:39:56,950 --> 02:39:57,490
Wait a second.

2528
02:39:57,610 --> 02:39:58,790
Is the clover the hint?

2529
02:40:01,290 --> 02:40:02,750
Of where to stand?

2530
02:40:06,530 --> 02:40:07,990
I'm our genius!

2531
02:40:09,250 --> 02:40:09,610
Whoa!

2532
02:40:10,210 --> 02:40:11,410
How did that boat get there?

2533
02:40:12,650 --> 02:40:15,070
Okay, I'm pretty sure it has to do with this journal now.

2534
02:40:16,310 --> 02:40:18,950
The exact same thing happened back at the barons.

2535
02:40:19,050 --> 02:40:21,170
I don't think I noticed the clover in the barons one.

2536
02:40:22,770 --> 02:40:23,230
Seriously?

2537
02:40:25,030 --> 02:40:26,410
I wanted to take a closer look at it.

2538
02:40:26,790 --> 02:40:31,110
Then I found a page that looked like a drawing of the room
we were in, and then a mine cart showed up.

2539
02:40:31,690 --> 02:40:32,090
What?

2540
02:40:32,810 --> 02:40:33,210
What?

2541
02:40:33,810 --> 02:40:35,110
That sounds freaky.

2542
02:40:35,450 --> 02:40:36,050
Stay freaky.

2543
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:39,290
No, it doesn't.

2544
02:40:39,790 --> 02:40:41,230
Ad Minto must have died in something.

2545
02:40:41,470 --> 02:40:42,870
Yeah, that's why it was freaky.

2546
02:40:44,830 --> 02:40:45,230
Still.

2547
02:40:49,430 --> 02:40:50,430
Hey, we have a boat now.

2548
02:40:50,870 --> 02:40:52,850
We can go to the burial grounds and visit mom again.

2549
02:40:53,090 --> 02:40:56,790
Wait, they're not going to get consumed by the squares, are
they?

2550
02:40:56,970 --> 02:40:58,010
Like the other two?

2551
02:41:00,410 --> 02:41:00,910
What?

2552
02:41:01,730 --> 02:41:02,610
Come on, Kalamaz.

2553
02:41:03,110 --> 02:41:04,770
Nico and Adminto are with us.

2554
02:41:05,570 --> 02:41:08,310
Well, if Adminto made the boat appear, we should be safe.

2555
02:41:10,410 --> 02:41:11,570
What do you think, Adminto?

2556
02:41:14,920 --> 02:41:16,220
No time to waste.

2557
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:18,800
Oh.

2558
02:41:19,420 --> 02:41:19,860
Wee!

2559
02:41:20,420 --> 02:41:20,700
Wee!

2560
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:21,140
Oh, oh.

2561
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:25,500
Why are they all staring at me like that?

2562
02:41:29,260 --> 02:41:30,540
Oh, so cute!

2563
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:33,840
It's like a cake pan.

2564
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:34,980
It really is.

2565
02:41:39,960 --> 02:41:41,460
Oh, so cute.

2566
02:41:41,580 --> 02:41:43,720
Oh, she's like...

2567
02:41:48,870 --> 02:41:49,770
So cute.

2568
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:59,130
They're looking at me like I said something really stupid.

2569
02:42:03,690 --> 02:42:05,150
We made it.

2570
02:42:06,230 --> 02:42:06,950
Come on, Alula.

2571
02:42:07,630 --> 02:42:08,810
Let's go pay our respects.

2572
02:42:09,630 --> 02:42:10,090
Okay.

2573
02:42:14,810 --> 02:42:15,730
Burial ground.

2574
02:42:16,870 --> 02:42:17,750
It's a gravestone.

2575
02:42:20,330 --> 02:42:21,450
It's a gravestone.

2576
02:42:21,990 --> 02:42:23,210
Wait, this one has a lot of text.

2577
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:24,790
It's a gravestone.

2578
02:42:25,490 --> 02:42:26,790
They hated this person.

2579
02:42:27,970 --> 02:42:29,510
Nobody wrote anything for them.

2580
02:42:35,710 --> 02:42:37,170
I guess maybe we'll find...

2581
02:42:37,170 --> 02:42:39,390
What was, like, a person's name that we were supposed to...

2582
02:42:41,650 --> 02:42:58,670
This person It's you Cedric You um My name is Nico Yeah Nice
to finally meet you No wait It is a pleasure to be of

2583
02:42:58,670 --> 02:43:09,690
acquaintance at last Nico My name is Cedric Oh I'm supposed
to be looking for you too The goal I am aware Prototype has

2584
02:43:09,690 --> 02:43:10,790
had contacted me.

2585
02:43:10,790 --> 02:43:11,870
Oh, so his name is Prototype.

2586
02:43:12,090 --> 02:43:14,790
He's not like Prophet Bot Zero or something.

2587
02:43:16,210 --> 02:43:19,670
Prototype had contacted me earlier saying that you would be
on your way to the city.

2588
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:22,170
Oh, when he was trying to establish the connection.

2589
02:43:23,190 --> 02:43:23,550
He did?

2590
02:43:23,990 --> 02:43:26,310
He sent me a message after his memories were restored.

2591
02:43:27,110 --> 02:43:27,170
Oh.

2592
02:43:27,690 --> 02:43:31,550
He told me to wait in the city, but I thought it'd be faster
for me to pick you guys up.

2593
02:43:32,410 --> 02:43:34,130
Turns out that was a terrible idea.

2594
02:43:35,490 --> 02:43:36,290
Pick us up?

2595
02:43:36,910 --> 02:43:38,590
Wait, you can fly that plane?

2596
02:43:39,630 --> 02:43:40,030
What?

2597
02:43:40,150 --> 02:43:42,150
Is that a... What is a plane?

2598
02:43:42,730 --> 02:43:44,050
That thing behind you!

2599
02:43:46,170 --> 02:43:47,130
A plane!

2600
02:43:48,350 --> 02:43:49,730
Oh, you mean the flying machine?

2601
02:43:50,130 --> 02:43:51,310
Oh my god, John Ace Combat.

2602
02:43:58,080 --> 02:43:59,800
They're called planes in my world.

2603
02:44:06,390 --> 02:44:08,670
I did not realize they existed in other worlds.

2604
02:44:09,350 --> 02:44:12,530
Wait, are you the friend that Calamus and Alula were talking
about them?

2605
02:44:13,050 --> 02:44:14,990
Is this the same flying machine they were talking about?

2606
02:44:15,470 --> 02:44:17,950
I do not know anyone named Calamus or Alula.

2607
02:44:17,970 --> 02:44:28,930
I think they're meant to be friends with my father In
previous iterations of the Your father He was the original

2608
02:44:28,930 --> 02:44:34,790
owner of the flying machine It's one of his greatest
inventions actually Oh no

2609
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:47,900
Your dad invented planes Flying machine It's cool either way
The author, right?

2610
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:55,620
That's what I was thinking Thanks But to answer your earlier
question, I am proficient in operating the machine.

2611
02:44:57,340 --> 02:44:59,980
But something weird happened to the engine when I was in the
air earlier.

2612
02:45:00,780 --> 02:45:04,940
I had to make an emergency landing on this tiny island
before I crashed into the city wall.

2613
02:45:09,220 --> 02:45:12,360
Was that why the father hasn't visited them?

2614
02:45:15,700 --> 02:45:17,020
He almost crashed?

2615
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:29,820
I tried Ace Combat after you talked about it Now my desk is
full of flight sim stuff Let's go You almost crashed That's

2616
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:36,620
terrible It was not pleasant I will admit I wonder if the
engine problem has to do with the square particle

2617
02:45:36,620 --> 02:45:43,740
disruptions I checked but There wasn't any of that square
stuff inside the machine itself But I noticed some islands

2618
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:51,960
in the Glen are really messed up now They are I guess I
should have listened to Proto in the first place.

2619
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:53,460
Say, where is he?

2620
02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:55,840
He said he was coming with you.

2621
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:01,280
Is he still back at the main island?

2622
02:46:02,260 --> 02:46:06,020
Well, actually, back at the barons, he...

2623
02:46:06,020 --> 02:46:08,720
There was a cave in, and then a bunch of squares.

2624
02:46:09,720 --> 02:46:11,340
He and the robot lady.

2625
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:13,860
Neither of them made it out.

2626
02:46:19,660 --> 02:46:21,400
He did give me this, though.

2627
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:23,700
This disc he pulled from his head.

2628
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:25,800
Oh, thank goodness.

2629
02:46:26,520 --> 02:46:27,840
He gave you his main drive.

2630
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:30,300
As long as I have this, I should be able to bring him back.

2631
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:31,180
Oh, nice.

2632
02:46:31,300 --> 02:46:32,860
It was so convenient being a...

2633
02:46:32,860 --> 02:46:36,800
That's why we keep Walt Disney's brain so that we can bring
him back, too.

2634
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:40,360
I'm going to eat some corn.

2635
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:40,800
One second.

2636
02:46:42,980 --> 02:46:44,040
Dinner is corn.

2637
02:46:44,940 --> 02:46:45,320
Everybody.

2638
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:55,690
it really it's gonna be hard but yes

2639
02:47:01,820 --> 02:47:09,680
what kind of corn just corn just corn

2640
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:23,200
You need all three of us for the big door.

2641
02:47:29,230 --> 02:47:32,010
The yellow kind, the one and only.

2642
02:47:33,870 --> 02:47:34,910
Garlic, butter, corn.

2643
02:47:35,670 --> 02:47:36,750
This has no...

2644
02:47:36,750 --> 02:47:38,610
This has a little bit of butter, but no garlic.

2645
02:47:43,910 --> 02:47:44,270
Yummy.

2646
02:47:45,250 --> 02:47:47,170
First things first, we need to find a way to go to the city.

2647
02:47:47,830 --> 02:47:48,050
Right.

2648
02:47:48,510 --> 02:47:50,170
The city gate is kind of kaput now.

2649
02:47:50,850 --> 02:47:52,190
If this machine was working, we could just...

2650
02:47:52,210 --> 02:47:53,430
just fly right in there.

2651
02:47:54,250 --> 02:47:57,770
I've isolated the issue with the machine, but I can't repair
it with the stuff I have on hand.

2652
02:47:59,090 --> 02:48:01,590
Time to desecrate some graves.

2653
02:48:05,030 --> 02:48:10,350
Somebody here must have been buried with their beloved Allen
wrench.

2654
02:48:14,390 --> 02:48:22,230
And a perfectly matching engine for the plan.

2655
02:48:27,950 --> 02:48:33,990
what's wrong with it the battery and the engine is dead and
the engine has some gears that need to be replaced someone

2656
02:48:33,990 --> 02:48:42,250
was buried with gears and i'm not saying that it was me
because that would be absolutely why would it be buried with

2657
02:48:42,250 --> 02:48:46,150
metal gear stuff that would be so crazy

2658
02:48:49,230 --> 02:48:57,570
corn with butter salt pepper and garlic powder garlic you
should get that powder should well we're probably fine on

2659
02:48:57,570 --> 02:49:05,130
the battery because we can probably use our the Sun for it
you think you'll be able to fix it if Adminto and I find

2660
02:49:05,130 --> 02:49:12,070
those things maybe problem is the Glen isn't exactly a very
high-tech area I'm not sure if you'll be able to find

2661
02:49:12,070 --> 02:49:19,430
anything so specialized here we'll try anyway we can't
really do anything else right now

2662
02:49:25,890 --> 02:49:40,540
gravestone she's my garlic girl that's me wait i can't go
see them oh wait is it a pathway okay just kidding

2663
02:49:43,670 --> 02:49:48,880
is this mama it's just a gravestone

2664
02:49:55,200 --> 02:50:06,620
hey do you know where i can find a battery oh my god they
are there good question use electricity in the glen.

2665
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:07,700
Ah.

2666
02:50:08,860 --> 02:50:11,080
Oh, but there are robots at the research station.

2667
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:13,640
If there's a battery anywhere, they'd know where it is.

2668
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:14,680
Gotcha.

2669
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:15,320
Thanks.

2670
02:50:17,960 --> 02:50:20,500
Oh, I wanted to see their talk about their mom.

2671
02:50:21,440 --> 02:50:22,100
Dang it.

2672
02:50:22,920 --> 02:50:24,420
Do you know where I could find some gears?

2673
02:50:24,940 --> 02:50:25,420
Gears?

2674
02:50:26,080 --> 02:50:26,920
What's that?

2675
02:50:27,640 --> 02:50:29,840
It's like a metal circle thing with teeth.

2676
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:31,600
A circle with teeth?

2677
02:50:32,220 --> 02:50:33,540
That sounds so silly.

2678
02:50:35,280 --> 02:50:37,140
would have magpie.

2679
02:50:37,580 --> 02:50:38,620
You know, the traitor guy.

2680
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:39,760
Oh, yeah.

2681
02:50:39,940 --> 02:50:41,320
He collects all kinds of funny stuff.

2682
02:50:41,820 --> 02:50:44,060
I mean, he even keeps around broken glass and junk.

2683
02:50:46,120 --> 02:50:46,640
Oh, yeah.

2684
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:48,520
I think I know who you're talking about.

2685
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:51,720
He's such a weirdo.

2686
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:53,340
What a weirdo.

2687
02:50:55,480 --> 02:50:56,920
Alright, so we have to go back home.

2688
02:50:57,180 --> 02:50:57,700
Not home.

2689
02:51:00,380 --> 02:51:00,780
Back.

2690
02:51:06,140 --> 02:51:06,820
Sorry, guys.

2691
02:51:06,880 --> 02:51:09,200
I didn't realize that their dialogue would change.

2692
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:12,860
Nico's judging me.

2693
02:51:17,380 --> 02:51:18,360
What a weirdo.

2694
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:21,140
What a silly little guy.

2695
02:51:21,420 --> 02:51:22,180
So silly.

2696
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:25,080
Alright.

2697
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:26,540
Alright.

2698
02:51:26,980 --> 02:51:28,040
We're running, running, running.

2699
02:51:28,720 --> 02:51:29,600
Wait, can I fast...

2700
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:32,780
Wait, I'm outside, or I'm inside, so I can't fast travel.

2701
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:34,400
I messed up!

2702
02:51:38,670 --> 02:51:40,170
And they could never leave the island.

2703
02:51:40,230 --> 02:51:41,350
They don't want to leave the island.

2704
02:51:41,470 --> 02:51:42,570
They're perfectly happy.

2705
02:51:43,710 --> 02:51:47,210
Their favorite song is on, and the air conditioning is
running.

2706
02:51:48,250 --> 02:51:49,010
They're fine.

2707
02:51:58,060 --> 02:51:58,380
Great.

2708
02:51:58,540 --> 02:51:59,160
What's a courtyard?

2709
02:52:01,380 --> 02:52:02,740
I'm not gonna risk it.

2710
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:07,100
I'm wondering if it's the courtyard that we were just in,
and I don't want to go through it again.

2711
02:52:08,620 --> 02:52:10,300
Wait, but I can't get across these.

2712
02:52:10,940 --> 02:52:11,920
The bridge is broken.

2713
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:14,720
Did she do any more vines?

2714
02:52:25,890 --> 02:52:26,330
Huh.

2715
02:52:30,570 --> 02:52:31,990
Coriard is where the ball is.

2716
02:52:32,110 --> 02:52:32,890
Okay, that's what I thought.

2717
02:52:33,090 --> 02:52:34,870
Yeah, yeah.

2718
02:52:47,810 --> 02:52:49,430
Nico, not sleepy.

2719
02:52:49,890 --> 02:52:51,470
How do I...

2720
02:52:51,470 --> 02:52:52,890
Another doorway in the ruins?

2721
02:52:53,070 --> 02:52:54,170
Oh, probably, right?

2722
02:52:55,390 --> 02:52:57,470
I guess that would be our only option.

2723
02:52:59,430 --> 02:53:00,830
Thank you for the idea.

2724
02:53:03,330 --> 02:53:06,090
My nose is so itchy recently, everybody.

2725
02:53:10,610 --> 02:53:17,210
not here here not here

2726
02:53:22,860 --> 02:53:42,000
if I go down we get to this is maybe I can ask her for some
more vines please keep doing your job lady thank you please

2727
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:53,280
maize maize I need more corn hello I um have something to
ask of you yes it looks like most of the bridges around the

2728
02:53:53,280 --> 02:54:01,060
Glen are broken and that's right the bridges you need to
cross them on your pilgrimage would you like me to fix them

2729
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:12,840
ah Casey yeah is it possible difficult bridges are in very
specific locations over water need to Find the right points.

2730
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:15,140
Vines must be very strong, too.

2731
02:54:18,660 --> 02:54:19,400
An undertaking.

2732
02:54:20,620 --> 02:54:21,940
Ah, but possible.

2733
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:25,440
I intend to use the last of my strength.

2734
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:27,290
Please stand back.

2735
02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:31,580
Whoa!

2736
02:54:35,570 --> 02:54:36,350
Are you okay?

2737
02:54:37,190 --> 02:54:37,990
Are you?

2738
02:54:40,930 --> 02:54:42,130
It's maze corn.

2739
02:54:42,290 --> 02:54:43,390
Try harder, maize.

2740
02:54:46,290 --> 02:54:48,370
She sprouted.

2741
02:54:54,380 --> 02:54:56,600
She bloomed.

2742
02:54:58,160 --> 02:54:59,120
No bays!

2743
02:55:01,580 --> 02:55:03,180
Okay, well.

2744
02:55:04,620 --> 02:55:06,300
That works.

2745
02:55:08,100 --> 02:55:12,690
We have some people.

2746
02:55:13,010 --> 02:55:17,790
There must be sacrifices for the greater good, everybody.

2747
02:55:19,290 --> 02:55:21,130
We had to do it.

2748
02:55:21,830 --> 02:55:23,010
for the vine.

2749
02:55:29,510 --> 02:55:30,770
She did it!

2750
02:55:32,070 --> 02:55:32,350
Yahoo!

2751
02:55:34,190 --> 02:55:35,650
Too soon, Min Tao, sorry.

2752
02:55:40,750 --> 02:55:41,890
Uh, up here?

2753
02:55:42,630 --> 02:55:43,410
Around here?

2754
02:55:44,190 --> 02:55:44,830
Uh, up here.

2755
02:55:44,950 --> 02:55:45,630
Oh, hello.

2756
02:55:48,290 --> 02:55:50,030
The bridge to the forest was just restored.

2757
02:55:50,790 --> 02:55:53,430
The village of Akiwi should be able to find better fishing
spots here.

2758
02:55:55,010 --> 02:55:57,210
The plant spirit is really looking out for us, isn't she?

2759
02:55:58,590 --> 02:55:58,830
Yeah.

2760
02:56:05,210 --> 02:56:06,510
One kind god.

2761
02:56:06,830 --> 02:56:08,910
And do it for the vine.

2762
02:56:09,710 --> 02:56:10,850
Is that a goat right there?

2763
02:56:12,870 --> 02:56:17,990
The land fragmentation is happening faster and faster now,
but it looks like the vines are slowing it down.

2764
02:56:21,050 --> 02:56:22,650
My mommy is making food for everyone.

2765
02:56:23,090 --> 02:56:25,290
I went to help her catch fish, but I'm not a grown-up yet.

2766
02:56:27,150 --> 02:56:34,530
other guy you're the trader guy sure i am you're here to
trade okay the world is ending and you won't give me

2767
02:56:34,530 --> 02:56:46,170
something for free as the messiah as the one who is here to
save this world i demand free service oh

2768
02:56:52,140 --> 02:56:57,680
because if you are then i got bad news for you a lot of my
stuff is back on my cart which was sadly abandoned when i

2769
02:56:57,680 --> 02:57:06,960
was running for my life so my collection is very limited
right now Man, I should grab some of my favorite things

2770
02:57:06,960 --> 02:57:07,840
before I left, though.

2771
02:57:08,420 --> 02:57:10,660
Oh, uh, do you have anything like... Gears?

2772
02:57:11,500 --> 02:57:11,980
Gears.

2773
02:57:13,360 --> 02:57:15,260
Like the metal spinny things?

2774
02:57:15,820 --> 02:57:17,560
Like a... Metal gear?

2775
02:57:18,220 --> 02:57:20,100
I don't think I have anything like that.

2776
02:57:21,300 --> 02:57:21,640
Wait.

2777
02:57:24,900 --> 02:57:27,900
I do have this box thing that you can wind up and play a
song.

2778
02:57:28,880 --> 02:57:29,940
That's a music box.

2779
02:57:35,100 --> 02:57:36,600
It said the thing!

2780
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:39,740
Yeah, I bet there's a lot of little metal bits in there.

2781
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:41,140
Oh, that might work.

2782
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:43,220
I'm not sure if I want to trade it away.

2783
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,020
It's one of my favorite things.

2784
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:47,380
Then why do you have it in your trade pile?

2785
02:57:49,860 --> 02:57:51,020
Oh, what am I saying?

2786
02:57:51,320 --> 02:57:52,140
You're the savior.

2787
02:57:52,800 --> 02:57:55,120
Things have gotten pretty bad around here lately.

2788
02:57:56,760 --> 02:57:59,300
If I don't help you, I might not even be around much longer.

2789
02:57:59,700 --> 02:58:01,300
Oh, he's sensible!

2790
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:04,180
You need this to save the world, right?

2791
02:58:05,600 --> 02:58:06,200
Take it.

2792
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:08,080
Ah, thank you!

2793
02:58:10,060 --> 02:58:11,180
I wonder what it sounds like.

2794
02:58:16,230 --> 02:58:18,190
Have you ever seen a big guy with goggles and a cool helmet?

2795
02:58:18,590 --> 02:58:20,490
Tell him the trader in the glen said hi.

2796
02:58:21,190 --> 02:58:23,430
I was asking him if he has any more music boxes for trading.

2797
02:58:24,010 --> 02:58:24,330
Well do.

2798
02:58:24,590 --> 02:58:25,370
It has a cloak...

2799
02:58:25,370 --> 02:58:26,430
We're on it, you guys.

2800
02:58:30,890 --> 02:58:31,710
What a day.

2801
02:58:31,790 --> 02:58:33,610
Oh my god, that guy is still spinning.

2802
02:58:34,270 --> 02:58:34,950
Oh no!

2803
02:58:35,670 --> 02:58:36,550
You think he's okay?

2804
02:58:38,330 --> 02:58:40,070
Clearly he makes a different sound now.

2805
02:58:40,130 --> 02:58:41,170
He's not going to sound like...

2806
02:58:41,190 --> 02:58:42,030
Blah!

2807
02:58:42,890 --> 02:58:43,130
Blah!

2808
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:02,880
Nothing's biting.

2809
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:04,100
Oh no!

2810
02:59:10,280 --> 02:59:14,020
Looks like the Glen is deteriorating faster than ever now.

2811
02:59:14,580 --> 02:59:14,980
Oh no!

2812
02:59:15,860 --> 02:59:16,800
Oh hello, Messiah.

2813
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,220
He's okay, as he's always been.

2814
02:59:20,680 --> 02:59:20,860
Blah!

2815
02:59:24,340 --> 02:59:26,120
Would you like some stew?

2816
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:28,240
I made enough to feed the whole village.

2817
02:59:28,540 --> 02:59:29,040
Literally.

2818
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:31,160
It's okay, thanks.

2819
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:34,300
We're trying to find a way to...

2820
02:59:34,300 --> 02:59:36,100
I feel like...

2821
02:59:36,720 --> 02:59:39,240
Why can't we use our light bulb on the battery?

2822
02:59:39,560 --> 02:59:39,900
You know?

2823
02:59:46,720 --> 02:59:49,460
Our village was ransacked by the squares not long ago.

2824
02:59:50,060 --> 02:59:52,320
Most of us made it out alive, but we can't really go back.

2825
02:59:52,640 --> 02:59:53,400
Most of us?

2826
02:59:53,420 --> 02:59:55,440
That means not everybody made it out alive.

2827
02:59:56,680 --> 02:59:58,120
Squares are bad news, man.

2828
03:00:09,190 --> 03:00:09,630
Uh...

2829
03:00:09,630 --> 03:00:11,250
This island has been more...

2830
03:00:11,250 --> 03:00:13,910
Has more moss covering than our village did.

2831
03:00:14,510 --> 03:00:16,370
Would be nice to build a settlement here.

2832
03:00:16,790 --> 03:00:17,890
Too late now, I guess.

2833
03:00:18,530 --> 03:00:18,890
Aww.

2834
03:00:20,450 --> 03:00:22,930
We have to find the place for the battery.

2835
03:00:24,530 --> 03:00:26,190
We said something about a robot, no?

2836
03:00:27,930 --> 03:00:28,430
Oh, wait.

2837
03:00:28,570 --> 03:00:29,190
I need you to move.

2838
03:00:29,290 --> 03:00:29,690
There we go.

2839
03:00:29,870 --> 03:00:30,550
Oh, never mind.

2840
03:00:30,710 --> 03:00:31,650
That only goes to there.

2841
03:00:36,130 --> 03:00:36,850
Maybe here?

2842
03:00:37,010 --> 03:00:37,610
Wait, why can't...

2843
03:00:37,610 --> 03:00:38,130
Oh, there we go.

2844
03:00:38,530 --> 03:00:39,090
Oh, never mind.

2845
03:00:40,450 --> 03:00:41,230
Oh, I think...

2846
03:00:41,250 --> 03:00:43,330
No, I can't get in there.

2847
03:00:43,910 --> 03:00:45,250
Those are the houses I was at before.

2848
03:00:51,530 --> 03:00:52,050
I'll...

2849
03:00:52,050 --> 03:00:58,490
Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh.

2850
03:00:58,490 --> 03:00:58,630
Wait.

2851
03:00:59,270 --> 03:01:00,450
Can I go through here?

2852
03:01:01,150 --> 03:01:03,050
That sheep is over there though!

2853
03:01:04,450 --> 03:01:04,970
Uh-oh.

2854
03:01:05,230 --> 03:01:05,950
He's dropped.

2855
03:01:07,430 --> 03:01:07,810
Hmm.

2856
03:01:13,270 --> 03:01:15,790
Maybe I need to look around a little bit more.

2857
03:01:20,530 --> 03:01:21,090
Um...

2858
03:01:21,090 --> 03:01:22,450
Where did I come from?

2859
03:01:23,750 --> 03:01:25,370
How was I born?

2860
03:01:27,350 --> 03:01:29,250
Where did I come from?

2861
03:01:30,610 --> 03:01:32,510
Oh wait, maybe over here.

2862
03:01:35,290 --> 03:01:36,630
Wait, is this where I came from?

2863
03:01:36,750 --> 03:01:37,010
No.

2864
03:01:38,290 --> 03:01:39,610
Where did I come from?

2865
03:01:41,210 --> 03:01:41,770
Robot!

2866
03:01:43,790 --> 03:01:45,570
Some vines just grew around this bridge.

2867
03:01:46,050 --> 03:01:49,150
Almost as if it was an intentional repair effort.

2868
03:01:51,670 --> 03:01:58,370
yeah hello I need a battery you do you know where I could
find a battery for a flying machine have you checked the

2869
03:01:58,370 --> 03:02:12,010
power room okay power room hello person this is the main
generator of the Glen hello would you happen to know where I

2870
03:02:12,010 --> 03:02:19,610
can find a battery for a flying machine it's kind of an
emergency I do not know what a flying machine is.

2871
03:02:20,810 --> 03:02:24,650
But any sort of large machinery would require a
high-capacity power cell.

2872
03:02:25,250 --> 03:02:28,770
For example, the generator in this room utilizes such a
device.

2873
03:02:29,470 --> 03:02:30,730
Oh right, I almost forgot.

2874
03:02:31,450 --> 03:02:34,410
We had to fix the battery for this thing in the barons,
didn't we add, Minto?

2875
03:02:35,310 --> 03:02:35,690
We did?

2876
03:02:43,660 --> 03:02:48,380
If this is an emergency for living beings, you can use the
battery from the generator.

2877
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:50,160
Oh!

2878
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:52,880
Wait, but if we take the battery here...

2879
03:02:54,080 --> 03:02:55,540
you guys would lose power, wouldn't you?

2880
03:02:56,920 --> 03:02:58,560
Maybe Adminto and I should go find another one.

2881
03:03:00,340 --> 03:03:05,400
This is the only battery in the Glen powerful enough to be
used as a standalone unit.

2882
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:11,340
If it is a dire situation, then do what you must.

2883
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:14,000
Fucking the binging.

2884
03:03:14,440 --> 03:03:14,760
I did?

2885
03:03:16,840 --> 03:03:18,180
The lens and the light and such?

2886
03:03:18,280 --> 03:03:19,320
Oh, that's what I did in the...

2887
03:03:19,320 --> 03:03:19,820
Oh, yeah.

2888
03:03:20,640 --> 03:03:22,400
But I didn't repair this specific one.

2889
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:23,640
I repaired the one in the barons.

2890
03:03:31,710 --> 03:03:34,410
I guess we have no choice but to take this Adminto.

2891
03:03:42,780 --> 03:03:43,940
I was gonna say it's quiet.

2892
03:03:44,480 --> 03:03:45,570
We depowered it.

2893
03:03:47,480 --> 03:03:49,020
It's fine, we're just borrowing it.

2894
03:03:49,740 --> 03:03:50,660
We're just borrowing it.

2895
03:03:51,460 --> 03:03:53,400
A robot without power.

2896
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:54,960
He's sitting so sad!

2897
03:03:56,340 --> 03:03:59,940
No, they look so proper and sad.

2898
03:04:01,180 --> 03:04:02,940
Oh, he's saying it's the same type of machine.

2899
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:03,240
Okay.

2900
03:04:06,860 --> 03:04:08,080
It's okay, we'll be back.

2901
03:04:09,900 --> 03:04:10,740
You'll be back, Lemon.

2902
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:14,520
We'll be back.

2903
03:04:15,800 --> 03:04:17,340
As long as I can find my way there.

2904
03:04:18,740 --> 03:04:19,420
I think I'm okay.

2905
03:04:19,880 --> 03:04:20,120
Wait.

2906
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:23,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2907
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:25,500
Wait, we can fast travel.

2908
03:04:25,720 --> 03:04:26,420
Duh, what am I doing?

2909
03:04:27,380 --> 03:04:27,700
Courtyard!

2910
03:04:29,400 --> 03:04:29,820
Here we go.

2911
03:04:32,720 --> 03:04:33,120
Okay.

2912
03:04:35,680 --> 03:04:36,440
Very good.

2913
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:39,200
Don't make a promise, you can't keep.

2914
03:04:41,920 --> 03:04:42,760
I'm not...

2915
03:04:42,760 --> 03:04:44,700
I didn't promise, I just said we'll be back.

2916
03:04:53,290 --> 03:04:53,930
Tipa tapa.

2917
03:04:57,310 --> 03:05:00,570
We're just about done here, so let us know when you want to
go back to the ruins.

2918
03:05:01,250 --> 03:05:01,550
Okay.

2919
03:05:04,390 --> 03:05:06,310
Did you find any... any...

2920
03:05:06,310 --> 03:05:07,290
What were you looking for again?

2921
03:05:07,830 --> 03:05:08,230
Gears?

2922
03:05:08,890 --> 03:05:09,310
Gears!

2923
03:05:09,610 --> 03:05:10,630
Did you find any of those?

2924
03:05:11,070 --> 03:05:12,630
No, but I found this music box.

2925
03:05:13,330 --> 03:05:13,690
Ooh!

2926
03:05:18,410 --> 03:05:18,770
Mama.

2927
03:05:29,270 --> 03:05:29,630
Oh!

2928
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:36,400
Sorry, I forgot.

2929
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:37,780
What part did you need to get?

2930
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:38,620
Oh, no, I didn't.

2931
03:05:39,400 --> 03:05:40,220
I did not forget.

2932
03:05:40,360 --> 03:05:41,620
Nico, why are you saying that?

2933
03:05:43,140 --> 03:05:44,880
Okay, we got our charged battery.

2934
03:05:45,740 --> 03:05:46,580
We found a battery.

2935
03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:47,720
Oh, nice.

2936
03:05:48,300 --> 03:05:49,700
I honestly wasn't expecting it.

2937
03:05:50,240 --> 03:05:52,040
It's from the generator on one of the islands.

2938
03:05:52,520 --> 03:05:54,280
Are the islands gonna sink now?

2939
03:05:56,500 --> 03:05:57,900
The research station?

2940
03:05:58,420 --> 03:06:01,160
Yeah, I was powering all of the robots there.

2941
03:06:01,660 --> 03:06:02,880
I feel bad for taking it.

2942
03:06:03,500 --> 03:06:05,500
Ah, we can always just give it back later.

2943
03:06:05,720 --> 03:06:06,040
Exactly!

2944
03:06:06,680 --> 03:06:08,400
We're just borrowing it.

2945
03:06:13,950 --> 03:06:15,650
And we still need a few gears.

2946
03:06:16,090 --> 03:06:17,550
Please do what you must to find some.

2947
03:06:18,910 --> 03:06:20,490
Well, funny you should ask.

2948
03:06:21,150 --> 03:06:22,170
We found a music box.

2949
03:06:22,590 --> 03:06:23,870
It should have gears in it, right?

2950
03:06:24,710 --> 03:06:26,870
I assume so, but...

2951
03:06:26,870 --> 03:06:28,330
This looks like...

2952
03:06:28,390 --> 03:06:30,370
One of the ones that my father made.

2953
03:06:31,750 --> 03:06:33,970
Your dad makes music boxes, too?

2954
03:06:34,830 --> 03:06:36,210
My dad makes a lot of things.

2955
03:06:37,510 --> 03:06:38,630
Where did you get this from, by the way?

2956
03:06:39,310 --> 03:06:40,870
A trader from the village gave it to me.

2957
03:06:41,470 --> 03:06:41,710
I see.

2958
03:06:42,410 --> 03:06:45,350
I remember father saying that he used to trade with some of
the people here.

2959
03:06:46,450 --> 03:06:49,310
He did always love traveling this world, despite...

2960
03:06:49,790 --> 03:06:50,250
Well...

2961
03:06:50,250 --> 03:06:51,370
Sorry, I started rambling.

2962
03:06:51,690 --> 03:06:52,330
Despite what?

2963
03:06:55,090 --> 03:06:55,550
No!

2964
03:06:58,340 --> 03:06:59,700
Not despite that!

2965
03:07:01,540 --> 03:07:09,600
despite being a simp Today is my birthday Since discovering
your streams last year It becomes a cherished part of my day

2966
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:17,160
Your warmth, laughter, and passion Truly touch my heart and
my spirit Every time Thank you so much Or thank you for

2967
03:07:17,160 --> 03:07:24,940
everything you do Thank you so much Thank you Anonymous
Happy birthday Thank you, thank you Happy

2968
03:07:32,550 --> 03:07:39,410
birthday There we go Thank you, thank you in there are
compatible with the engine.

2969
03:07:39,830 --> 03:07:41,570
Although it pains me to have to take it apart.

2970
03:07:42,370 --> 03:07:43,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

2971
03:07:43,410 --> 03:07:43,890
It's fine.

2972
03:07:46,210 --> 03:07:48,510
Looks like the flying machine has a chance after all.

2973
03:07:49,210 --> 03:07:51,410
I just have to assemble the pieces now, but it might take a
while.

2974
03:07:51,950 --> 03:07:52,950
Do you mind keeping me company?

2975
03:07:54,270 --> 03:07:55,670
Just keeping this guy company.

2976
03:07:57,270 --> 03:07:57,910
How's it going?

2977
03:07:58,150 --> 03:07:59,590
He's like, I just started, Nico.

2978
03:08:00,790 --> 03:08:02,830
I haven't even picked up the wrench, Nico.

2979
03:08:04,970 --> 03:08:05,370
Nico?

2980
03:08:05,510 --> 03:08:06,090
Are we there yet?

2981
03:08:06,510 --> 03:08:07,330
Are we there yet?

2982
03:08:07,750 --> 03:08:08,750
Are we there yet?

2983
03:08:09,950 --> 03:08:10,390
Slow.

2984
03:08:11,170 --> 03:08:15,190
The connectors in the battery were not designed for this
type of engine, so I have to shift around some of these

2985
03:08:15,190 --> 03:08:15,650
ports.

2986
03:08:17,710 --> 03:08:21,370
And there's this bolt that keeps getting stuck, and...

2987
03:08:22,870 --> 03:08:25,370
Don't worry, I am making decent progress.

2988
03:08:26,130 --> 03:08:27,950
We should be able to make it to the city by tonight.

2989
03:08:28,910 --> 03:08:29,790
There we say so.

2990
03:08:32,990 --> 03:08:34,890
What will happen once we get there?

2991
03:08:35,610 --> 03:08:37,270
We need to bring Proto back first.

2992
03:08:37,750 --> 03:08:45,070
and then we need to go find one more person yeah he did
mention all three of them have to be there right you may

2993
03:08:45,070 --> 03:08:51,950
have met her already actually do you remember her from the
last time you were in this world uh which which girl who

2994
03:08:53,330 --> 03:08:55,750
what does she look like

2995
03:08:59,180 --> 03:09:09,000
this is going to sound strange but she is a fox the one that
said come back have a fun streaming though i'm gonna try and

2996
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:09,920
fix my sleep schedule.

2997
03:09:10,140 --> 03:09:11,080
Good night, sulking!

2998
03:09:11,780 --> 03:09:13,760
Good night, good night, good night, sweet dreams.

2999
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:15,140
Good night, good night, good night.

3000
03:09:15,360 --> 03:09:17,060
Thanks for sticking around for so late.

3001
03:09:20,340 --> 03:09:22,520
Oh, I thought they were going to say like the engineer or
something.

3002
03:09:23,720 --> 03:09:24,520
Wait, no way.

3003
03:09:24,620 --> 03:09:28,440
We got a fox and we have a metal gear.

3004
03:09:30,320 --> 03:09:30,700
Guys.

3005
03:09:36,300 --> 03:09:38,620
I do remember talking to a fox at one point.

3006
03:09:40,220 --> 03:09:40,980
Fox alive.

3007
03:09:41,860 --> 03:09:44,020
Yeah, that's what we're going to do to the world.

3008
03:09:44,460 --> 03:09:46,320
We're going to fox alive it.

3009
03:09:47,100 --> 03:09:47,720
I believe.

3010
03:09:48,380 --> 03:09:49,000
You met Rue?

3011
03:09:49,800 --> 03:09:51,580
The memories are still really blurry, though.

3012
03:09:52,120 --> 03:09:52,440
I see.

3013
03:09:54,600 --> 03:09:56,300
It's just hard, you know.

3014
03:09:56,980 --> 03:09:59,080
Roto told me to think of this world like a dream.

3015
03:09:59,640 --> 03:10:00,960
But then I get so caught up with.

3016
03:10:01,720 --> 03:10:03,480
I just kind of forget.

3017
03:10:04,740 --> 03:10:08,180
I forget that everything here is supposed to be not real.

3018
03:10:09,100 --> 03:10:09,880
And then I remember.

3019
03:10:11,060 --> 03:10:11,900
It's not really sad.

3020
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,060
I know this is for me to go home, but...

3021
03:10:17,600 --> 03:10:19,100
Which character is Naomi?

3022
03:10:19,640 --> 03:10:20,340
None of them.

3023
03:10:20,940 --> 03:10:23,020
Don't utter her name into my chat.

3024
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:26,400
Do not even type.

3025
03:10:27,140 --> 03:10:27,720
Don't even.

3026
03:10:29,980 --> 03:10:30,500
Don't even.

3027
03:10:31,440 --> 03:10:33,460
Quick game recommendation in My Little Puppy.

3028
03:10:33,660 --> 03:10:35,240
I don't think I'm gonna play it.

3029
03:10:35,400 --> 03:10:36,180
But thank you.

3030
03:10:37,560 --> 03:10:38,940
I've heard about it.

3031
03:10:39,280 --> 03:10:40,360
I don't think I'll play it.

3032
03:10:43,440 --> 03:10:44,800
She's the squares.

3033
03:10:55,850 --> 03:10:57,890
Knowing that none of it mattered in the first place.

3034
03:11:01,260 --> 03:11:02,800
Am I just trapped here for no reason?

3035
03:11:09,290 --> 03:11:12,130
Proto also told me to not ask anyone in the world about
this.

3036
03:11:13,470 --> 03:11:15,290
Saying how they don't understand.

3037
03:11:16,350 --> 03:11:17,150
What about him?

3038
03:11:19,010 --> 03:11:20,150
How did he know?

3039
03:11:21,410 --> 03:11:22,610
How do you know?

3040
03:11:23,170 --> 03:11:35,990
aren't you guys all supposed to be code well I'm not sure
what to even believe anymore why is he giving that face I

3041
03:11:35,990 --> 03:11:43,790
wish Rue was here she's so much better explaining this sort
of thing I'm doing a terrible job at it I bet Proto was even

3042
03:11:43,790 --> 03:11:57,480
less tactful wasn't he I'm afraid I must risk sounding
callous but please yourself with how real everything is for

3043
03:11:57,480 --> 03:11:57,820
now.

3044
03:11:58,960 --> 03:12:00,040
The plan is already in motion.

3045
03:12:00,340 --> 03:12:01,680
We cannot allow for distractions.

3046
03:12:02,860 --> 03:12:05,660
Father is putting everything into this one last run of the
world.

3047
03:12:07,720 --> 03:12:09,360
The last chance for him to fix everything.

3048
03:12:11,460 --> 03:12:13,180
Your father is involved in the world machine?

3049
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:15,140
You could say that.

3050
03:12:15,700 --> 03:12:17,260
Oh no, father is the dev.

3051
03:12:17,360 --> 03:12:20,700
He is the father because he created everybody in this game!

3052
03:12:21,580 --> 03:12:22,060
No!

3053
03:12:25,160 --> 03:12:36,540
Minto Crying Simulator I'm very bad with games about pets So
they are very I'm very sensitive to that So especially even

3054
03:12:36,540 --> 03:12:42,000
if it's a game Where it's like something happens to a pet Or
something I'm very sensitive So I don't think I'll be

3055
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:43,920
playing the sad dog game Sorry

3056
03:12:48,840 --> 03:12:53,140
The acceleration of square particle anomalies Was not
accounted for at all though.

3057
03:12:53,820 --> 03:12:57,980
The patch was only built to accommodate the normal rate they
appear, but...

3058
03:12:57,980 --> 03:12:59,460
Oh, just patch the game, Dev.

3059
03:12:59,580 --> 03:13:00,080
Come on!

3060
03:13:01,440 --> 03:13:03,500
They're accumulating at frightening speeds now.

3061
03:13:04,840 --> 03:13:06,580
That game broke me in 20 minutes?

3062
03:13:07,080 --> 03:13:07,440
I don't know.

3063
03:13:07,520 --> 03:13:10,380
I don't think you guys want to just hear me cry the whole
time, right?

3064
03:13:12,540 --> 03:13:14,700
I don't think you guys want to just hear me be like...

3065
03:13:21,480 --> 03:13:22,920
Proto even lost his boss.

3066
03:13:22,940 --> 03:13:23,320
him.

3067
03:13:25,080 --> 03:13:26,900
Thankfully, he gave you the disc just in time.

3068
03:13:27,880 --> 03:13:28,860
So what happened to him anyway?

3069
03:13:30,540 --> 03:13:31,600
Some of them do.

3070
03:13:32,580 --> 03:13:34,980
SniffleStream, Alvier's sniffle-tuber.

3071
03:13:36,340 --> 03:13:39,080
I feel like I'm already so sniffly right now.

3072
03:13:41,540 --> 03:13:43,740
What happens to anyone who gets caught in the squares?

3073
03:13:44,460 --> 03:13:45,440
I only know it's bad.

3074
03:13:46,260 --> 03:13:47,980
Well, you know how the simulation works, right?

3075
03:13:52,940 --> 03:13:58,680
I know I'm a wee bit late, I will wish you good health, but
do ghosts get sick?

3076
03:13:59,000 --> 03:13:59,120
Yeah!

3077
03:14:00,860 --> 03:14:02,900
I'm always suffering and impaired!

3078
03:14:04,040 --> 03:14:04,700
Stay safe.

3079
03:14:05,120 --> 03:14:07,340
Oh, anyways, boss, and avoid vacuum cleaners.

3080
03:14:07,840 --> 03:14:08,900
I'm not supposed to clean?

3081
03:14:10,440 --> 03:14:12,060
Thank you so much!

3082
03:14:12,160 --> 03:14:12,880
Thank you!

3083
03:14:13,560 --> 03:14:14,540
Happy New Year!

3084
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:18,600
The phantom has pain.

3085
03:14:18,940 --> 03:14:20,040
The phantom pain.

3086
03:14:23,700 --> 03:14:25,860
Well, you know how the simulation works, right?

3087
03:14:26,740 --> 03:14:27,780
How everything is cold?

3088
03:14:28,800 --> 03:14:31,540
Specifically everything is generated from pre-existing code.

3089
03:14:33,180 --> 03:14:35,000
The squares can cause damage to that code.

3090
03:14:35,700 --> 03:14:37,540
Most of the time, irreversible damage.

3091
03:14:38,400 --> 03:14:40,540
Father has lost some friends in previous iterations.

3092
03:14:41,480 --> 03:14:42,520
Of the simulation.

3093
03:14:43,840 --> 03:14:47,040
It took him forever to develop the current, much more stable
version.

3094
03:14:48,040 --> 03:14:50,680
You're making it sound like your dad built the simulation
himself.

3095
03:14:51,420 --> 03:14:51,720
Wait.

3096
03:14:52,940 --> 03:14:53,540
Did he?

3097
03:14:54,300 --> 03:14:54,780
Yeah.

3098
03:14:55,400 --> 03:14:55,940
But how?

3099
03:14:56,360 --> 03:14:59,800
If everyone in this world is code, how can he build himself?

3100
03:15:00,760 --> 03:15:02,880
That's, um, not really what happened.

3101
03:15:03,940 --> 03:15:04,800
So what happened?

3102
03:15:06,200 --> 03:15:09,280
Like I said, you shouldn't concern yourself with...

3103
03:15:10,440 --> 03:15:10,960
With...

3104
03:15:10,960 --> 03:15:11,960
Alright, alright.

3105
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:17,900
He's giving him, like, sad, sad, sad kitty eyes.

3106
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:20,380
It wasn't even puppy dog eyes.

3107
03:15:20,540 --> 03:15:21,940
It was just sad, sad kitty.

3108
03:15:23,860 --> 03:15:26,160
Did Prototype ever tell you about the Old World?

3109
03:15:27,800 --> 03:15:31,240
He did say something about being built to greet the Messiah
of the Old World.

3110
03:15:32,160 --> 03:15:35,640
I was, um, too caught up with the other stuff at the time to
think about it.

3111
03:15:37,960 --> 03:15:39,140
You can't resist.

3112
03:15:39,340 --> 03:15:40,340
I know he's too cute.

3113
03:15:40,700 --> 03:15:41,880
Nico, so stinking cute.

3114
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:44,840
Ah, you know of it at least then.

3115
03:15:45,260 --> 03:15:46,040
Alright, here we go.

3116
03:15:46,840 --> 03:15:49,200
My father, myself, the other two.

3117
03:15:50,080 --> 03:15:52,060
None of us are part of the simulation itself.

3118
03:15:53,240 --> 03:15:59,560
Our homeworld, the real world, was actually destroyed a long
time ago.

3119
03:16:03,020 --> 03:16:07,980
In the years leading up to the calamity, scientists from all
over the world tried to stop it, but the outlook was bleak.

3120
03:16:09,140 --> 03:16:13,880
A vague prophecy about a messiah from another world became
everyone's last bastion of hope.

3121
03:16:14,940 --> 03:16:20,500
Prophet by a prototype was built to predict the future about
the specifics of this messiah.

3122
03:16:22,940 --> 03:16:28,980
But as his predictions turned out, the Messiah would not
have been able to arrive to our world in time.

3123
03:16:31,020 --> 03:16:34,340
In fact, the Messiah would not even have been born before
the world ended.

3124
03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:35,780
Wait, what's...

3125
03:16:35,780 --> 03:16:36,480
How are they the...

3126
03:16:36,480 --> 03:16:38,080
How are they the Messiah, then?

3127
03:16:40,560 --> 03:16:42,640
I think you should change their title.

3128
03:16:45,180 --> 03:16:45,620
Disheartened.

3129
03:16:45,700 --> 03:16:49,380
Most people abandon their research and resolve to peacefully
live out their final years.

3130
03:16:50,560 --> 03:16:51,500
Yeah, slight problem.

3131
03:16:55,680 --> 03:16:57,720
Should have made him messiah a robot.

3132
03:16:57,880 --> 03:16:58,660
You're so right.

3133
03:17:00,320 --> 03:17:01,600
But some people did the opposite.

3134
03:17:02,700 --> 03:17:06,720
Even though saving the world was impossible, they didn't
want our existence to be in vain.

3135
03:17:07,600 --> 03:17:09,560
And that's where my father came in.

3136
03:17:11,660 --> 03:17:16,340
With the last of his resources, he built his most ambitious
project yet.

3137
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:18,020
The world machine.

3138
03:17:18,640 --> 03:17:20,620
A large, detailed...

3139
03:17:21,460 --> 03:17:22,020
For...

3140
03:17:22,940 --> 03:17:23,140
Oh,

3141
03:17:30,280 --> 03:17:35,100
the old world.

3142
03:17:38,540 --> 03:17:39,260
Faximily.

3143
03:17:41,160 --> 03:17:41,880
Faximily.

3144
03:17:42,280 --> 03:17:42,600
Faximily.

3145
03:17:48,200 --> 03:17:51,000
Generated from a pool of memories collected from everyone.

3146
03:17:51,320 --> 03:17:51,700
You know.

3147
03:17:54,340 --> 03:18:02,060
After a heavy amount of modification and an added narrative,
my father was able to convert an entire structure into code.

3148
03:18:03,080 --> 03:18:03,760
Oh, sorry.

3149
03:18:06,180 --> 03:18:08,000
How did that code escape the old world?

3150
03:18:08,800 --> 03:18:09,740
I have no idea.

3151
03:18:10,640 --> 03:18:12,240
Copy works too.

3152
03:18:14,320 --> 03:18:16,260
Technically, that's what a fax is.

3153
03:18:17,260 --> 03:18:18,680
Isn't a fax simile?

3154
03:18:19,660 --> 03:18:21,640
I never knew that.

3155
03:18:22,940 --> 03:18:23,540
What?

3156
03:18:26,680 --> 03:18:28,240
Oh my god.

3157
03:18:30,180 --> 03:18:30,820
Whoa!

3158
03:18:32,400 --> 03:18:33,960
That's what fax is short for.

3159
03:18:36,080 --> 03:18:37,360
I learned!

3160
03:18:38,700 --> 03:18:39,120
What?

3161
03:18:43,570 --> 03:18:44,590
Oh my god.

3162
03:18:46,130 --> 03:18:50,510
What I do know is there is no equipment back home that was
powerful enough to run the code independently.

3163
03:18:51,450 --> 03:18:52,730
Brain expansion.

3164
03:18:54,950 --> 03:18:55,430
Emily!

3165
03:18:57,770 --> 03:19:02,550
Oh, one of my old OL jobs had a fax machine still.

3166
03:19:03,470 --> 03:19:07,010
And sometimes we would just get things that were like...

3167
03:19:07,010 --> 03:19:08,630
This is...

3168
03:19:08,630 --> 03:19:11,230
We would get spam faxes.

3169
03:19:11,970 --> 03:19:13,970
Like, they would be like...

3170
03:19:13,970 --> 03:19:14,730
Do you...

3171
03:19:14,730 --> 03:19:18,630
Like, sometimes we would get ones that were like, You are
the...

3172
03:19:18,630 --> 03:19:20,670
Are the, you know, like the...

3173
03:19:20,670 --> 03:19:22,210
The Nigerian Prince.

3174
03:19:22,390 --> 03:19:23,310
Things like that.

3175
03:19:25,030 --> 03:19:29,350
It was literally like spam emails, but as a fax.

3176
03:19:34,440 --> 03:19:37,080
Which I'm like, who is sending this?

3177
03:19:38,500 --> 03:19:38,940
Who?

3178
03:19:41,300 --> 03:19:43,400
It's weird seeing it in print print.

3179
03:19:43,520 --> 03:19:44,100
I know!

3180
03:19:44,600 --> 03:19:46,120
That's wasting your ink.

3181
03:19:46,380 --> 03:19:46,740
I know.

3182
03:19:48,980 --> 03:19:51,960
It actually was the craziest thing to witness.

3183
03:20:02,960 --> 03:20:03,840
It's so funny.

3184
03:20:07,180 --> 03:20:14,620
thievery me yeah it wasn't you it wasn't you

3185
03:20:19,580 --> 03:20:29,300
i once got a spam phone call on the elevator i was like an
actual elevator i heard there are a lot of diabetes

3186
03:20:29,300 --> 03:20:36,880
medication spam faxes nowadays what there were other ones
too that were like do you need insurance or something but

3187
03:20:36,880 --> 03:20:47,460
like those ones sound normal but like getting the rare the
rare pull of the of like the oh i've died and here's i have

3188
03:20:47,460 --> 03:20:58,080
10 million dollars in my bank to left to you i'm like ma'am
this is a wendy's also you died how are you sending this fax

3189
03:21:06,440 --> 03:21:14,640
anyway yeah aside from the standard hardware it also needed
to borrow the mental processing abilities of a living person

3190
03:21:15,320 --> 03:21:22,360
father used himself for that during the initial testing
phases this is getting this is hurting my brain all the i'm

3191
03:21:22,360 --> 03:21:30,520
kind of confused what's going on like i said it took many
iterations for him to make the experience stable enough.

3192
03:21:31,740 --> 03:21:33,940
But as you can see, even that's breaking down.

3193
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:35,660
Yeah, lore dump.

3194
03:21:36,680 --> 03:21:40,940
Father Kai onto the issue in that last minute, but did not
have enough time to fix it.

3195
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:46,360
After the world ended, the code kind of just ended up
floating in the void indefinitely.

3196
03:21:48,240 --> 03:21:51,900
Waiting for a willing operator to install it onto their own
hardware.

3197
03:21:52,860 --> 03:21:54,380
He uploaded it to Steam.

3198
03:21:56,960 --> 03:21:58,000
He uploaded it to Steam.

3199
03:21:58,080 --> 03:21:58,700
Adminto?

3200
03:21:59,580 --> 03:21:59,760
Yeah.

3201
03:22:02,240 --> 03:22:08,160
The operator, Adminto, would then generate the universe
using the code, becoming God in the process.

3202
03:22:10,640 --> 03:22:11,880
He didn't spread the code!

3203
03:22:12,280 --> 03:22:13,660
Spread my code!

3204
03:22:14,120 --> 03:22:15,180
Spread my code!

3205
03:22:19,300 --> 03:22:22,340
So Adminto was the living person you needed to borrow.

3206
03:22:22,760 --> 03:22:24,960
Oh my gosh, wait, this is like a reverse possession!

3207
03:22:25,120 --> 03:22:25,940
You can't do that.

3208
03:22:26,580 --> 03:22:26,820
No?

3209
03:22:27,880 --> 03:22:28,360
you.

3210
03:22:29,420 --> 03:22:30,200
But why me?

3211
03:22:33,060 --> 03:22:35,700
I should have asked that question a long time ago, shouldn't
I?

3212
03:22:36,400 --> 03:22:37,200
I do not know.

3213
03:22:37,720 --> 03:22:38,520
Because you're cute.

3214
03:22:39,800 --> 03:22:41,280
We really need to get going.

3215
03:22:44,980 --> 03:22:45,560
It's fixed.

3216
03:22:46,360 --> 03:22:48,680
We can leave in the next five minutes if you are ready.

3217
03:22:49,340 --> 03:22:49,820
Alright.

3218
03:22:50,900 --> 03:22:52,420
I understand if you are upset.

3219
03:22:53,260 --> 03:22:54,700
But please try to understand.

3220
03:22:55,420 --> 03:22:57,660
My father... That you're standing really close to that fire.

3221
03:22:58,220 --> 03:22:58,700
Sorry.

3222
03:22:59,100 --> 03:23:01,360
My father is doing this to help all of us.

3223
03:23:02,040 --> 03:23:03,060
And that includes you, Nico.

3224
03:23:03,840 --> 03:23:05,600
The fact that you can't even go back home.

3225
03:23:06,400 --> 03:23:07,720
I'm sure it upsets him greatly.

3226
03:23:09,280 --> 03:23:09,820
It's...

3227
03:23:09,820 --> 03:23:12,340
The world means a lot to him, you know.

3228
03:23:13,360 --> 03:23:15,440
They need the cutest living being.

3229
03:23:16,420 --> 03:23:16,700
Yes!

3230
03:23:17,160 --> 03:23:19,740
And that's why I am playing, too.

3231
03:23:21,940 --> 03:23:22,480
Sorry.

3232
03:23:25,360 --> 03:23:27,000
So how does flying work?

3233
03:23:27,900 --> 03:23:30,420
Wait, don't these machines already exist in your world?

3234
03:23:34,440 --> 03:23:35,000
Mito.

3235
03:23:35,460 --> 03:23:35,880
Mito.

3236
03:23:36,340 --> 03:23:36,620
Sweet.

3237
03:23:37,140 --> 03:23:37,560
Mito.

3238
03:23:40,020 --> 03:23:41,320
But you're dead.

3239
03:23:41,560 --> 03:23:43,400
Now, but I have a con...

3240
03:23:43,400 --> 03:23:45,480
I have a consciousness.

3241
03:23:50,070 --> 03:23:51,070
I'm thinking.

3242
03:23:54,930 --> 03:23:56,690
You should already know what to expect.

3243
03:23:57,250 --> 03:23:57,770
Not really.

3244
03:23:58,230 --> 03:23:59,410
I've only heard about them.

3245
03:23:59,950 --> 03:24:01,690
They're usually a lot bigger than this one anyway.

3246
03:24:02,170 --> 03:24:02,570
Ah.

3247
03:24:03,630 --> 03:24:04,850
Well, a word of precaution.

3248
03:24:07,770 --> 03:24:09,370
Sorry, before we take it to the air.

3249
03:24:10,090 --> 03:24:10,910
Please try not to panic.

3250
03:24:11,590 --> 03:24:14,850
It takes a few minutes of getting used to, but it's not that
bad once you're in the air.

3251
03:24:17,370 --> 03:24:21,650
A mind is what matters, and I have that.

3252
03:24:23,610 --> 03:24:24,410
I'll try.

3253
03:24:24,950 --> 03:24:27,250
Oh, I should probably tell Kalimus and Alula that we're
going.

3254
03:24:28,550 --> 03:24:30,270
You mean those two running over here now?

3255
03:24:30,650 --> 03:24:31,050
Uh-oh.

3256
03:24:31,950 --> 03:24:32,430
Nico!

3257
03:24:34,510 --> 03:24:34,930
The squares?

3258
03:24:35,670 --> 03:24:36,290
Bad news!

3259
03:24:36,770 --> 03:24:37,570
The boat is gone!

3260
03:24:38,630 --> 03:24:38,790
What?

3261
03:24:39,230 --> 03:24:40,070
It's the squares!

3262
03:24:40,750 --> 03:24:42,310
Looks like they're headed in this direction.

3263
03:24:43,330 --> 03:24:44,270
That's... fast.

3264
03:24:46,850 --> 03:24:47,610
Calimus, right?

3265
03:24:48,610 --> 03:24:49,090
Yeah?

3266
03:24:49,690 --> 03:24:50,890
How bad is it?

3267
03:24:51,630 --> 03:24:53,450
Doesn't seem to be of immediate danger.

3268
03:24:54,270 --> 03:24:55,230
Famous last words.

3269
03:24:56,510 --> 03:24:58,610
Oh, I was gonna say, here comes the squares.

3270
03:24:59,690 --> 03:25:00,910
Then it is our...

3271
03:25:00,910 --> 03:25:01,830
Then it is our...

3272
03:25:01,850 --> 03:25:04,510
our priority that I take you to the city first, Nico.

3273
03:25:05,270 --> 03:25:05,930
But what about them?

3274
03:25:06,470 --> 03:25:09,470
I can make a detour later and drop you guys off in the city
too if you want.

3275
03:25:10,090 --> 03:25:11,890
The city is better equipped to handle the squares.

3276
03:25:12,190 --> 03:25:13,070
You'll be safer there.

3277
03:25:14,190 --> 03:25:15,450
You're taking us to the city!

3278
03:25:16,130 --> 03:25:16,970
If you wish.

3279
03:25:17,570 --> 03:25:18,230
Oh yeah!

3280
03:25:19,190 --> 03:25:19,770
All right.

3281
03:25:20,230 --> 03:25:23,410
I will be back in an hour, so please wait for me until then.

3282
03:25:23,590 --> 03:25:24,270
An hour?

3283
03:25:25,130 --> 03:25:26,610
That's a long time.

3284
03:25:27,910 --> 03:25:29,850
You guys are sure you'll be fine here?

3285
03:25:30,450 --> 03:25:31,610
It's a reverse inception.

3286
03:25:31,850 --> 03:25:36,570
All because you Ouroboros the Year with Pizza Rolls.

3287
03:25:38,450 --> 03:25:47,190
You cannot end the year with Pizza Rolls and start the next
year with Pizza Rolls.

3288
03:25:47,190 --> 03:25:47,650
With Pizza Rolls!

3289
03:25:47,770 --> 03:25:49,070
You can't do it!

3290
03:25:52,050 --> 03:25:54,070
You guys sure you'll be fine here?

3291
03:25:54,230 --> 03:25:54,590
Mm-hmm.

3292
03:25:55,090 --> 03:25:57,370
The squares are still moving pretty slowly for now.

3293
03:25:58,250 --> 03:25:58,850
Alright then.

3294
03:25:59,270 --> 03:26:01,210
Guess we'll run into each other again soon.

3295
03:26:04,270 --> 03:26:05,970
Death flag, death flag, death flag!

3296
03:26:06,390 --> 03:26:07,890
I'm ready to go!

3297
03:26:08,450 --> 03:26:08,790
Alright.

3298
03:26:13,290 --> 03:26:15,650
Infinite pizza Mobius strip.

3299
03:26:16,350 --> 03:26:18,230
Oh sorry, I just noticed my cursor.

3300
03:26:18,850 --> 03:26:19,350
Wow!

3301
03:26:19,950 --> 03:26:20,600
We're flying!

3302
03:26:21,690 --> 03:26:21,910
Oh!

3303
03:26:22,610 --> 03:26:23,530
We're flying!

3304
03:26:25,590 --> 03:26:26,050
Aww!

3305
03:26:27,410 --> 03:26:28,810
Nico's so cute!

3306
03:26:29,950 --> 03:26:32,090
Whoa, the city is pink.

3307
03:26:35,920 --> 03:26:36,440
Phew!

3308
03:26:37,240 --> 03:26:37,840
Made it.

3309
03:26:38,220 --> 03:26:41,440
That is the tiniest place to land ever.

3310
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:45,240
You okay there?

3311
03:26:45,820 --> 03:26:46,080
Ah!

3312
03:26:47,340 --> 03:26:49,760
That was the coolest thing I've ever done in my entire life!

3313
03:26:51,500 --> 03:26:53,840
Reactions from first timers are always delightful to watch.

3314
03:26:54,920 --> 03:26:55,180
Ah!

3315
03:26:58,980 --> 03:27:00,340
Major skills though.

3316
03:27:00,480 --> 03:27:00,740
I know.

3317
03:27:01,720 --> 03:27:02,340
Hey, Adminto?

3318
03:27:03,160 --> 03:27:04,020
That was really fun.

3319
03:27:04,780 --> 03:27:05,540
Did you have fun too?

3320
03:27:06,660 --> 03:27:10,340
I mean, you weren't on the plane with me, but you got to
watch it at least, right?

3321
03:27:11,820 --> 03:27:15,120
And Cedric, well, you haven't been talking so much to Nico
this time.

3322
03:27:16,760 --> 03:27:22,900
You know, like responding and like, I want to be able to say
that I had a ton of fun.

3323
03:27:23,640 --> 03:27:25,400
I want to be able to say that I had the mostest fun.

3324
03:27:27,460 --> 03:27:29,800
And Cedric, yeah, thanks.

3325
03:27:30,700 --> 03:27:34,500
If you're heading to bed, good night, or if you're heading
out, see you later.

3326
03:27:34,760 --> 03:27:35,720
Thank you so much for watching.

3327
03:27:35,740 --> 03:27:36,780
She didn't hang it out with me.

3328
03:27:37,620 --> 03:27:38,140
Thank you, thank you.

3329
03:27:39,400 --> 03:27:40,120
What for?

3330
03:27:40,960 --> 03:27:41,280
Flying!

3331
03:27:42,280 --> 03:27:44,220
Hello, um, you're welcome.

3332
03:27:45,600 --> 03:27:47,560
And for answering my questions back there, too.

3333
03:27:48,160 --> 03:27:50,060
And for telling me more about the world machine.

3334
03:27:50,760 --> 03:27:53,220
I'm just really sorry about what happened to your old world,
though.

3335
03:27:53,960 --> 03:27:55,940
So I'll help you the best that I can.

3336
03:27:59,850 --> 03:28:00,290
And...

3337
03:28:00,290 --> 03:28:04,690
Wait, why is Nico afraid of ladders, but he's not afraid of
flying?

3338
03:28:05,810 --> 03:28:06,250
Hmm...

3339
03:28:07,510 --> 03:28:11,310
Even if it's all just a machine, this world is still nice.

3340
03:28:12,070 --> 03:28:16,490
I mean, I got to fly, I got to see the ocean, and I got to
meet a lot of nice people.

3341
03:28:23,520 --> 03:28:24,920
Ladders are hella freaky.

3342
03:28:27,800 --> 03:28:29,360
Ladders bring bad luck.

3343
03:28:29,760 --> 03:28:30,120
Maybe.

3344
03:28:32,140 --> 03:28:35,540
People like you and prototype, even if he's broken right
now.

3345
03:28:37,640 --> 03:28:39,400
I'm glad you are taking it so well, Nico.

3346
03:28:40,300 --> 03:28:42,200
And I'm glad that we have met as well.

3347
03:28:42,920 --> 03:28:44,380
Despite the circumstances.

3348
03:28:46,920 --> 03:28:48,820
Speaking of Proto, I should probably head off now.

3349
03:28:49,480 --> 03:28:50,960
I need to go pick up the siblings too.

3350
03:28:51,400 --> 03:28:51,700
Siblings?

3351
03:28:53,740 --> 03:28:54,460
That's true.

3352
03:28:54,800 --> 03:28:56,080
Those two have been waiting for a while.

3353
03:28:56,240 --> 03:28:57,180
Oh yeah, the other girl.

3354
03:28:57,260 --> 03:28:57,680
Yeah, yeah.

3355
03:28:58,280 --> 03:29:01,880
I thought he meant like siblings of Proto type or whatever.

3356
03:29:04,680 --> 03:29:07,080
Maybe he hates feeling them wobble when he's holding on to
them.

3357
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:09,800
Bad luck since this black cat.

3358
03:29:10,300 --> 03:29:11,320
I thought that too.

3359
03:29:12,140 --> 03:29:15,000
In the meantime, do you remember what to do to get to the
surface?

3360
03:29:15,580 --> 03:29:17,280
I remember having to fix an elevator button.

3361
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:19,300
Alright, you should attend to that then.

3362
03:29:20,040 --> 03:29:21,400
Let's meet up here in an hour, okay?

3363
03:29:21,980 --> 03:29:22,580
Got it.

3364
03:29:23,100 --> 03:29:24,300
Alright, now let me just...

3365
03:29:25,100 --> 03:29:25,580
What's happening?

3366
03:29:30,400 --> 03:29:30,840
No!

3367
03:29:32,900 --> 03:29:34,540
They're trapped on the island!

3368
03:29:36,680 --> 03:29:39,360
Calamus, Alula, there!

3369
03:29:41,400 --> 03:29:42,720
Who could have seen this coming?

3370
03:29:44,360 --> 03:29:46,180
We don't have much time left.

3371
03:29:47,240 --> 03:29:48,100
Nico, change your plans.

3372
03:29:49,260 --> 03:29:50,300
Please give me the memory stick.

3373
03:29:52,520 --> 03:29:53,180
Listen carefully.

3374
03:29:54,280 --> 03:29:55,640
It's likely I'll be targeted again.

3375
03:29:56,080 --> 03:29:57,740
So we should split up to keep you safe.

3376
03:29:58,820 --> 03:30:01,340
I want you to find a doctor under a large clock.

3377
03:30:04,020 --> 03:30:07,180
The room behind it houses a pair of ground access elevators.

3378
03:30:07,880 --> 03:30:11,160
Once you get to the ground, immediately find Rue and bring
her back to the room.

3379
03:30:13,580 --> 03:30:18,060
meantime all right what about you though i'm going to bring
prototype back

3380
03:30:26,230 --> 03:30:38,870
door not doctor oh did i say doctor wait it didn't say door
oh wait i mean it didn't say doctor it said door it

3381
03:30:43,400 --> 03:30:46,620
said door not doctor i

3382
03:30:52,020 --> 03:30:57,500
was gonna go wait so i was about to go look for like a

3383
03:31:02,040 --> 03:31:09,380
I was like, I don't remember a room that had a, like a, like
an infirmary or anything.

3384
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:21,340
Okay.

3385
03:31:22,560 --> 03:31:23,080
Don't worry.

3386
03:31:25,410 --> 03:31:26,550
Don't scare me like that.

3387
03:31:27,230 --> 03:31:27,390
All right.

3388
03:31:27,470 --> 03:31:28,010
We got to hurry.

3389
03:31:28,750 --> 03:31:29,150
Come on.

3390
03:31:30,690 --> 03:31:31,710
I'm sorry.

3391
03:31:33,190 --> 03:31:34,730
Why did I think it said doctor?

3392
03:31:37,270 --> 03:31:38,310
Hey, Admito.

3393
03:31:38,890 --> 03:31:40,070
Let's do our best.

3394
03:31:41,150 --> 03:31:41,930
Gamba Minto.

3395
03:31:42,910 --> 03:32:04,730
let's go so funny sorry guys for my brain please do not
approach they're so sad when they're like all glitched out

3396
03:32:04,730 --> 03:32:13,670
oh it's this guy again come on come on work already the
elevator guy

3397
03:32:18,460 --> 03:32:20,040
Yeah, the BGM's so good here.

3398
03:32:21,220 --> 03:32:21,860
Come on.

3399
03:32:21,920 --> 03:32:22,800
Come on.

3400
03:32:23,260 --> 03:32:24,560
Now of all times.

3401
03:32:25,440 --> 03:32:26,820
Uh, excuse me.

3402
03:32:27,620 --> 03:32:27,780
Whoa.

3403
03:32:28,720 --> 03:32:29,380
You're you.

3404
03:32:30,060 --> 03:32:30,480
Oh, geez.

3405
03:32:30,640 --> 03:32:31,840
I didn't think I was going to run into.

3406
03:32:32,560 --> 03:32:33,980
The elevator is missing a button, right?

3407
03:32:34,520 --> 03:32:35,080
How did you know?

3408
03:32:40,120 --> 03:32:41,340
Glances at the camera.

3409
03:32:44,160 --> 03:32:45,900
You think you're slick, Nico, huh?

3410
03:32:51,310 --> 03:32:53,230
Yeah, I'll write it in chat.

3411
03:32:57,110 --> 03:32:58,550
He literally just did that to us.

3412
03:33:11,070 --> 03:33:12,770
I'm Pinto and I will help you fix it.

3413
03:33:14,550 --> 03:33:15,290
Oh, thank goodness.

3414
03:33:15,970 --> 03:33:18,150
The evacuees are counting on this.

3415
03:33:18,630 --> 03:33:19,110
On me.

3416
03:33:19,810 --> 03:33:22,010
But I've been here for hours and can't figure out a thing.

3417
03:33:23,410 --> 03:33:24,250
The evacuees.

3418
03:33:25,350 --> 03:33:27,250
My debit card is crying right now.

3419
03:33:27,330 --> 03:33:28,930
No, please don't.

3420
03:33:29,130 --> 03:33:30,370
Please don't super chat.

3421
03:33:30,530 --> 03:33:42,710
you can't please thank you but no please don't you know from
the west apartments the square stuff wrecked the place

3422
03:33:42,710 --> 03:33:50,550
yesterday oh right now everyone's crowded in the cafe oh we
really want to get everyone to the surface as soon as

3423
03:33:50,550 --> 03:33:58,830
possible though the library on the surface doubles as a
shelter for situations like this I see wait didn't we find

3424
03:33:58,830 --> 03:34:00,630
the magnets and stuff in the apartment Adminto?

3425
03:34:01,310 --> 03:34:01,590
What?

3426
03:34:02,270 --> 03:34:04,750
Looks like we'll have to find some other way to fix the
button.

3427
03:34:06,650 --> 03:34:07,350
Oh my god!

3428
03:34:08,010 --> 03:34:08,830
Holy fudge!

3429
03:34:11,290 --> 03:34:13,690
Looks like Adminto and I will find another way down
altogether.

3430
03:34:14,090 --> 03:34:15,670
Wait, we are... we were told how to get down.

3431
03:34:16,370 --> 03:34:18,390
But this is the only elevator in that... in the area.

3432
03:34:19,250 --> 03:34:20,070
Well, think of something.

3433
03:34:21,950 --> 03:34:24,910
That is... that is a terrible fire hazard.

3434
03:34:25,050 --> 03:34:25,610
What are you talking about?

3435
03:34:25,670 --> 03:34:26,870
There's only one elevator.

3436
03:34:28,630 --> 03:34:33,470
And no or any sort of contingency.

3437
03:34:36,790 --> 03:34:40,390
Okay, so it's a doctor, but below...

3438
03:34:40,390 --> 03:34:42,010
Does this count as a giant clock?

3439
03:34:43,710 --> 03:34:45,390
Here we are at the 11th hour.

3440
03:34:47,390 --> 03:34:49,150
Shouldn't you be with the other evacuees?

3441
03:34:49,830 --> 03:34:50,130
Maybe.

3442
03:34:51,610 --> 03:34:53,930
I wonder if the big clock has reached zero yet.

3443
03:34:55,070 --> 03:34:57,050
I want to be right here when everything ends.

3444
03:34:57,370 --> 03:34:59,450
Oh my gosh, wait, we're really running out of time.

3445
03:35:01,010 --> 03:35:02,230
Where's the big cloak?

3446
03:35:06,540 --> 03:35:08,120
Communications with the surface have been lost.

3447
03:35:08,680 --> 03:35:09,860
I am unable to do anything.

3448
03:35:10,940 --> 03:35:11,420
What was this?

3449
03:35:12,340 --> 03:35:13,180
Who took my sapler?

3450
03:35:16,060 --> 03:35:18,100
Some kind of computer terminal.

3451
03:35:20,360 --> 03:35:23,040
In this coded game, of course, Nico can't do ladders.

3452
03:35:23,300 --> 03:35:24,080
It summons Cynthia.

3453
03:35:24,480 --> 03:35:28,040
She can't handle the thrill and climb at the same time.

3454
03:35:28,580 --> 03:35:29,520
You're so right.

3455
03:35:33,870 --> 03:35:35,310
Oh, trill.

3456
03:35:37,690 --> 03:35:39,010
The screen is off.

3457
03:35:41,990 --> 03:35:42,990
Who took my stapler?

3458
03:35:43,990 --> 03:35:46,650
In this world, the stapler has been...

3459
03:35:46,650 --> 03:35:47,330
Is it...

3460
03:35:47,330 --> 03:35:47,910
Steinsky?

3461
03:35:48,630 --> 03:35:49,970
The door is locked.

3462
03:35:50,330 --> 03:35:51,750
Looks like it's asking for a password.

3463
03:35:52,390 --> 03:35:55,110
The word documents is on the screen above the password
prompt.

3464
03:35:56,410 --> 03:35:57,290
Whoa, that's long.

3465
03:36:05,320 --> 03:36:06,100
This one?

3466
03:36:06,880 --> 03:36:08,200
It's not a solstice, is it?

3467
03:36:08,420 --> 03:36:08,680
Yeah.

3468
03:36:17,960 --> 03:36:18,560
Unless...

3469
03:36:18,560 --> 03:36:20,240
Does that even fit, Solstice?

3470
03:36:33,510 --> 03:36:34,110
Oh!

3471
03:36:34,650 --> 03:36:35,630
It worked.

3472
03:36:36,510 --> 03:36:36,730
Maybe.

3473
03:36:37,670 --> 03:36:38,130
Did it work?

3474
03:36:39,470 --> 03:36:40,610
Oh, it worked!

3475
03:36:41,350 --> 03:36:43,050
I'm gonna minimize this again.

3476
03:36:45,850 --> 03:36:47,210
Stop looking at my documents!

3477
03:36:49,730 --> 03:36:52,990
Hold on now, I wanna go check out the people and the...

3478
03:36:55,130 --> 03:36:57,170
in the cafe first.

3479
03:36:58,070 --> 03:37:00,130
It looks so much like the things in Steinsgate.

3480
03:37:02,150 --> 03:37:03,230
What's up here?

3481
03:37:08,040 --> 03:37:12,020
I think this is where we had like a big heart-to-heart
together.

3482
03:37:20,930 --> 03:37:24,510
I've been watching Steinsgate Zero.

3483
03:37:25,230 --> 03:37:26,550
I'm not very far in it.

3484
03:37:27,690 --> 03:37:30,730
Honestly, I should watch more of that than Breaking Bad.

3485
03:37:35,730 --> 03:37:37,490
It's so good, I know.

3486
03:37:39,230 --> 03:37:41,010
I love you.

3487
03:37:41,530 --> 03:37:43,890
I love you, AI, Kurisu.

3488
03:37:48,320 --> 03:37:50,660
Wait, it's over here, right?

3489
03:37:51,740 --> 03:37:52,220
Yes.

3490
03:37:53,540 --> 03:37:54,180
Hello.

3491
03:37:54,760 --> 03:37:56,420
Oh, hello, Messiah.

3492
03:37:57,280 --> 03:37:59,420
You, um, you came at a bad time.

3493
03:37:59,920 --> 03:38:02,460
The apartment in the West sector got destroyed by Squares a
Day ago.

3494
03:38:02,480 --> 03:38:15,700
go terrible isn't it yeah ah but at least the evacuees seem
to be doing okay we're letting them stay here for now oh she

3495
03:38:15,700 --> 03:38:25,760
still doesn't say anything same as usual uh what is the
penguin gonna say I'm scared.

3496
03:38:27,380 --> 03:38:28,160
Oh, it's that penguin.

3497
03:38:28,720 --> 03:38:29,240
Hello.

3498
03:38:30,700 --> 03:38:31,340
I'm gonna...

3499
03:38:31,340 --> 03:38:31,800
Yep.

3500
03:38:32,280 --> 03:38:33,400
It makes me want to throw up.

3501
03:38:33,540 --> 03:38:34,120
It's so creepy.

3502
03:38:40,270 --> 03:38:40,770
Dang it.

3503
03:38:41,030 --> 03:38:42,690
I just moved into my apartment.

3504
03:38:43,310 --> 03:38:44,330
Now where am I gonna go?

3505
03:38:47,770 --> 03:38:49,590
Kanako Ito is just so...

3506
03:38:49,590 --> 03:38:50,530
I'm so...

3507
03:38:50,530 --> 03:38:51,170
She's so...

3508
03:38:51,170 --> 03:38:51,810
She's amazing.

3509
03:38:53,030 --> 03:38:55,330
Our apartment got evacuated while my parents were at work.

3510
03:38:56,770 --> 03:38:57,290
up now.

3511
03:38:57,550 --> 03:38:58,290
I hope they're okay.

3512
03:38:58,790 --> 03:39:00,170
At least my robot's with me.

3513
03:39:01,410 --> 03:39:02,950
Squares make the people evacuate.

3514
03:39:03,830 --> 03:39:05,350
Evacuation makes the girl sad.

3515
03:39:05,830 --> 03:39:06,850
Squares are bad.

3516
03:39:08,930 --> 03:39:08,970
Hey.

3517
03:39:09,670 --> 03:39:10,010
Hi.

3518
03:39:10,910 --> 03:39:11,370
Is it me?

3519
03:39:11,830 --> 03:39:13,050
Or is it really cold outside?

3520
03:39:13,930 --> 03:39:18,530
You know, now that you mentioned it, it is really chilly
this time around, Adminto.

3521
03:39:19,390 --> 03:39:20,610
Good thing you've got a scarf, huh?

3522
03:39:21,530 --> 03:39:21,890
Mm-hmm.

3523
03:39:25,000 --> 03:39:25,400
Bummer!

3524
03:39:25,680 --> 03:39:27,460
I had to leave most of my plants behind.

3525
03:39:28,100 --> 03:39:28,500
This too.

3526
03:39:28,520 --> 03:39:28,940
Thanks.

3527
03:39:29,420 --> 03:39:30,940
Sorry to hear.

3528
03:39:32,580 --> 03:39:33,260
Sorry, boss.

3529
03:39:33,540 --> 03:39:33,780
Beato.

3530
03:39:34,280 --> 03:39:35,300
I have been out of the country.

3531
03:39:35,520 --> 03:39:36,720
Oh, sounds fun!

3532
03:39:37,080 --> 03:39:38,600
Happy belated Christmas and New Year's.

3533
03:39:39,080 --> 03:39:40,920
Wish you the best in 2026.

3534
03:39:41,400 --> 03:39:42,120
You too!

3535
03:39:42,260 --> 03:39:42,820
Uncle...

3536
03:39:44,260 --> 03:39:44,820
Uncle...

3537
03:39:44,820 --> 03:39:45,820
Uncle... Uncle...

3538
03:39:46,580 --> 03:39:47,140
Uncle...

3539
03:39:47,140 --> 03:39:48,160
Uncle...

3540
03:39:51,360 --> 03:39:51,920
Uncle...

3541
03:39:53,960 --> 03:39:56,340
Sorry, I probably said that wrong.

3542
03:39:58,320 --> 03:39:59,120
Thank you!

3543
03:40:00,900 --> 03:40:05,080
Speaking of plants, I heard the Glen is just covered in
vines now.

3544
03:40:05,540 --> 03:40:05,980
Is that true?

3545
03:40:06,780 --> 03:40:10,080
Yeah, the plant lady was using them to keep the land from
falling away.

3546
03:40:10,860 --> 03:40:12,100
The plant spirit, maize?

3547
03:40:12,580 --> 03:40:13,080
I figured.

3548
03:40:13,700 --> 03:40:14,640
Say, how is she doing?

3549
03:40:16,720 --> 03:40:18,660
Ah, she's gone, isn't she?

3550
03:40:19,420 --> 03:40:22,160
She said she was using up the last of her powers.

3551
03:40:22,840 --> 03:40:23,960
I wouldn't be surprised.

3552
03:40:25,660 --> 03:40:27,480
She always did her best to protect everyone.

3553
03:40:28,780 --> 03:40:29,180
Sad.

3554
03:40:31,080 --> 03:40:37,440
Everybody, this is like so, the game before was already so
sad, but this is just, it just feels so helpless.

3555
03:40:43,150 --> 03:40:46,290
I do want to see if we can see anything of the apartment
still.

3556
03:40:48,030 --> 03:40:48,710
Let's see.

3557
03:40:50,950 --> 03:40:52,770
Oh, there was a bed down here.

3558
03:40:54,810 --> 03:40:57,090
The bed areas always seem to stay safe, huh?

3559
03:40:58,070 --> 03:40:58,550
Curious.

3560
03:40:59,130 --> 03:41:00,330
I wonder if it's the clovers.

3561
03:41:01,030 --> 03:41:02,310
The clovers keep things safe.

3562
03:41:02,350 --> 03:41:03,290
Oh, wow, no.

3563
03:41:03,370 --> 03:41:04,190
We can't go anywhere.

3564
03:41:04,470 --> 03:41:05,090
Okay, just kidding.

3565
03:41:11,160 --> 03:41:12,560
Melancholy replaced with tragedy.

3566
03:41:15,640 --> 03:41:16,000
Okay.

3567
03:41:17,080 --> 03:41:17,400
Wow.

3568
03:41:17,980 --> 03:41:19,740
So she's considered a giant claw.

3569
03:41:19,820 --> 03:41:21,960
Oh wait, maybe this is the giant claw hawk.

3570
03:41:22,360 --> 03:41:23,540
I'm gonna say.

3571
03:41:24,020 --> 03:41:26,400
How rude to call her a giant claw.

3572
03:41:32,220 --> 03:41:34,420
Went to Japan in June.

3573
03:41:35,980 --> 03:41:36,920
Sounds fun.

3574
03:41:36,940 --> 03:41:38,180
I don't know if I was...

3575
03:41:38,180 --> 03:41:39,220
Wait, was I in Japan in June?

3576
03:41:39,340 --> 03:41:39,700
I don't know.

3577
03:41:43,620 --> 03:41:45,140
I hope you had fun.

3578
03:41:45,720 --> 03:41:46,500
Thank you for your super chat.

3579
03:41:46,680 --> 03:41:47,260
This one's green.

3580
03:41:48,360 --> 03:41:48,720
Red.

3581
03:41:50,740 --> 03:41:51,140
Poipol.

3582
03:41:57,310 --> 03:41:59,010
This elevator has no button panel.

3583
03:41:59,950 --> 03:42:01,530
Tapping the door doesn't open it either.

3584
03:42:02,250 --> 03:42:03,030
That usually works.

3585
03:42:03,730 --> 03:42:03,890
Wait.

3586
03:42:04,650 --> 03:42:06,270
There's a lever hanging from the ceiling.

3587
03:42:06,710 --> 03:42:06,850
Oh.

3588
03:42:07,450 --> 03:42:08,390
Can we reach that?

3589
03:42:10,410 --> 03:42:11,270
Can't reach it.

3590
03:42:15,780 --> 03:42:17,480
Akihabara is full of Minto energy?

3591
03:42:18,080 --> 03:42:18,240
Yes!

3592
03:42:27,210 --> 03:42:28,670
This elevator won't open.

3593
03:42:29,250 --> 03:42:30,790
It looks like it's stuck on another floor.

3594
03:42:33,170 --> 03:42:34,250
Do we have a puzzle here?

3595
03:42:35,850 --> 03:42:37,810
We have a puzzle, but I'm not quite sure.

3596
03:42:39,610 --> 03:42:41,010
Find someone tall.

3597
03:42:44,530 --> 03:42:45,570
Who would be tall enough?

3598
03:42:46,010 --> 03:42:46,510
Clock lady?

3599
03:42:47,530 --> 03:42:50,450
Every hue, every pink and green and blue!

3600
03:42:57,330 --> 03:43:03,270
are you tall good evening please leave me be we are running
out of time

3601
03:43:07,400 --> 03:43:08,600
and red

3602
03:43:12,200 --> 03:43:22,300
wait maybe he can help us he's pretty tall hey we found some
elevators what seriously i've literally never seen another

3603
03:43:22,300 --> 03:43:25,180
one in this area it was in a locked room.

3604
03:43:27,700 --> 03:43:28,060
Oh.

3605
03:43:28,860 --> 03:43:29,880
Do they, uh, work?

3606
03:43:30,180 --> 03:43:30,860
We don't know yet.

3607
03:43:31,260 --> 03:43:33,080
One of them has a lever that's out of my reach.

3608
03:43:33,900 --> 03:43:34,940
Wait, you can help us!

3609
03:43:35,500 --> 03:43:35,700
What?

3610
03:43:36,140 --> 03:43:38,760
You should be able to reach the lever because you're taller
than me!

3611
03:43:39,540 --> 03:43:40,780
Oh, I guess I am?

3612
03:43:42,480 --> 03:43:43,640
Show me the way, I suppose.

3613
03:43:44,600 --> 03:43:46,300
Alright, let's run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

3614
03:43:47,100 --> 03:43:53,340
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,

3615
03:43:53,340 --> 03:43:53,340
run, run, run,

3616
03:43:57,080 --> 03:43:58,820
Run, run, run, run, run.

3617
03:43:59,000 --> 03:43:59,840
We're saving the world.

3618
03:44:01,780 --> 03:44:02,500
The timer is...

3619
03:44:02,500 --> 03:44:03,300
The timer is complete.

3620
03:44:03,380 --> 03:44:04,760
Wait, was this timer here before?

3621
03:44:04,880 --> 03:44:05,800
I don't remember this.

3622
03:44:06,340 --> 03:44:08,020
I don't remember it looking like that for sure.

3623
03:44:09,060 --> 03:44:09,460
Scary.

3624
03:44:12,700 --> 03:44:13,960
I mean, taller.

3625
03:44:14,640 --> 03:44:15,360
I'm tall, yeah.

3626
03:44:16,340 --> 03:44:17,980
This room gives me the creeps, man.

3627
03:44:18,540 --> 03:44:19,100
Oh, same.

3628
03:44:19,700 --> 03:44:19,900
Yep.

3629
03:44:20,280 --> 03:44:21,920
So, uh, what did you need help with again?

3630
03:44:22,960 --> 03:44:23,400
Come on.

3631
03:44:23,480 --> 03:44:24,960
I just told you two minutes ago.

3632
03:44:26,100 --> 03:44:26,860
the lever up there.

3633
03:44:27,400 --> 03:44:27,700
Oh, right.

3634
03:44:28,060 --> 03:44:28,240
Wait.

3635
03:44:28,780 --> 03:44:29,860
I'm not that tall.

3636
03:44:30,660 --> 03:44:32,720
Well, it was worth the... Put me on your shoulders!

3637
03:44:34,800 --> 03:44:36,160
Wait, I got this.

3638
03:44:37,840 --> 03:44:38,080
Oh!

3639
03:44:39,040 --> 03:44:39,480
Nice!

3640
03:44:40,200 --> 03:44:41,040
Thank you, mister.

3641
03:44:41,540 --> 03:44:42,200
No problem, kid.

3642
03:44:43,200 --> 03:44:43,860
So you coming?

3643
03:44:44,480 --> 03:44:44,720
Mm-hmm.

3644
03:44:45,720 --> 03:44:47,340
Wait, what about all the other people, though?

3645
03:44:58,900 --> 03:45:00,860
This is where the tower is.

3646
03:45:01,020 --> 03:45:02,360
Oh, neat.

3647
03:45:03,340 --> 03:45:05,280
Looks like this elevator works all right.

3648
03:45:05,800 --> 03:45:08,280
I'll go get the evacuees, I suppose.

3649
03:45:12,400 --> 03:45:13,980
Um, what is going on?

3650
03:45:14,040 --> 03:45:15,900
Oh my god, no, it's Tower of Terror.

3651
03:45:17,140 --> 03:45:17,300
Oh!

3652
03:45:17,820 --> 03:45:18,240
No!

3653
03:45:18,800 --> 03:45:20,380
It's the square stuff, isn't it?

3654
03:45:21,540 --> 03:45:24,620
There aren't any in here, but I can hear them just outside
the door.

3655
03:45:25,720 --> 03:45:25,760
Yeah.

3656
03:45:26,360 --> 03:45:27,360
Hold on, maybe I can...

3657
03:45:27,980 --> 03:45:28,980
No, no, it's okay.

3658
03:45:29,680 --> 03:45:32,140
Looks like the squares aren't inside the elevator.

3659
03:45:37,050 --> 03:45:42,270
Before the Solstice update came out, the timer marked the
time left until the update came out.

3660
03:45:42,570 --> 03:45:43,550
It was placed very long.

3661
03:45:43,810 --> 03:45:46,230
Oh, that's really cool actually.

3662
03:45:46,530 --> 03:45:49,410
Okay, thank you for explaining it because I was like, why is
it here?

3663
03:45:49,510 --> 03:45:50,310
Why is it zero?

3664
03:45:50,750 --> 03:45:51,510
What's happening?

3665
03:45:55,730 --> 03:45:56,250
Yet.

3666
03:45:57,150 --> 03:45:58,270
You're in a hurry, right?

3667
03:45:58,710 --> 03:46:00,090
Go do what you need to do.

3668
03:46:00,430 --> 03:46:02,270
Everybody that's helping us is dying.

3669
03:46:02,830 --> 03:46:03,510
Oh my god.

3670
03:46:04,730 --> 03:46:05,450
What about you?

3671
03:46:05,990 --> 03:46:07,490
I'll figure something out.

3672
03:46:08,150 --> 03:46:12,170
Okay, that was our only elevator to get the people out.

3673
03:46:14,270 --> 03:46:16,770
Okay, now I have to remember where the fox was.

3674
03:46:18,030 --> 03:46:20,430
I remember she was in, like, a...

3675
03:46:20,430 --> 03:46:21,710
The door won't budge.

3676
03:46:24,210 --> 03:46:26,530
She was in the alleyway.

3677
03:46:26,930 --> 03:46:28,310
We have to find the alleyway.

3678
03:46:30,070 --> 03:46:31,150
What do you think he's doing in there?

3679
03:46:31,490 --> 03:46:32,430
Contemplating everything?

3680
03:46:32,930 --> 03:46:34,050
All that's gone wrong?

3681
03:46:36,330 --> 03:46:38,050
I don't think we should go in the tower just now.

3682
03:46:41,450 --> 03:46:45,570
Yeah, she was in the city.

3683
03:46:46,950 --> 03:46:47,450
Okay, cool.

3684
03:46:49,870 --> 03:46:50,890
Please, you mustn't!

3685
03:46:51,250 --> 03:46:53,270
The labs could collapse at any moment now!

3686
03:46:54,570 --> 03:46:55,510
Let go of me!

3687
03:46:55,930 --> 03:46:56,490
Oh, no!

3688
03:47:00,530 --> 03:47:01,610
Uh-oh.

3689
03:47:02,190 --> 03:47:02,530
Cedric?

3690
03:47:03,070 --> 03:47:04,650
He could swim, right?

3691
03:47:04,810 --> 03:47:06,650
Why are we acting like he can't swim?

3692
03:47:08,070 --> 03:47:09,590
People can't swim in the water.

3693
03:47:11,850 --> 03:47:12,330
He...

3694
03:47:12,990 --> 03:47:14,790
I couldn't stop him.

3695
03:47:18,210 --> 03:47:18,610
Miss?

3696
03:47:19,850 --> 03:47:20,330
Messiah!

3697
03:47:23,330 --> 03:47:24,610
What if it's not water?

3698
03:47:24,870 --> 03:47:26,970
You could swim in any...

3699
03:47:26,970 --> 03:47:28,030
You could swim in a liquid.

3700
03:47:33,590 --> 03:47:35,510
Oh, you came at an awful time.

3701
03:47:36,230 --> 03:47:37,490
Come on, we have to get out of here.

3702
03:47:38,790 --> 03:47:39,530
Where, too?

3703
03:47:40,210 --> 03:47:41,530
Where everyone else is right now.

3704
03:47:41,750 --> 03:47:42,310
The library?

3705
03:47:42,950 --> 03:47:43,490
Wait, no, no.

3706
03:47:43,590 --> 03:47:57,380
to go to the alley wait no don't take my hand hello miss
silver point i'm glad wait we got five this time last time

3707
03:47:57,380 --> 03:48:06,730
it was two and she was me there's a butt head i don't like
her i

3708
03:48:17,410 --> 03:48:27,830
guess i guess because it's two we had two five would be the
opposite so the second time you play the game fun.

3709
03:48:29,070 --> 03:48:29,730
Hello, Miss Silverpoint.

3710
03:48:29,890 --> 03:48:31,090
I'm glad you've made it back safely.

3711
03:48:32,630 --> 03:48:33,430
Gosh, you could have...

3712
03:48:33,430 --> 03:48:34,990
You should have told me where you were going.

3713
03:48:35,810 --> 03:48:36,490
Sorry, George.

3714
03:48:37,670 --> 03:48:39,410
I keep hearing good things about six.

3715
03:48:43,900 --> 03:48:44,820
I see.

3716
03:48:44,940 --> 03:48:45,960
You also found the Messiah.

3717
03:48:46,740 --> 03:48:47,980
Well, hello, little one.

3718
03:48:49,120 --> 03:48:49,540
Hi.

3719
03:48:50,580 --> 03:48:54,540
We ran into each other after this boy forced himself into
the lab complex.

3720
03:48:56,840 --> 03:48:58,120
Five is very protective.

3721
03:48:58,420 --> 03:48:58,660
Ooh.

3722
03:48:59,080 --> 03:48:59,700
Five is own name.

3723
03:48:59,720 --> 03:49:00,120
Jason!

3724
03:49:01,700 --> 03:49:02,980
I couldn't stop him.

3725
03:49:03,860 --> 03:49:05,680
I don't know why he was being so insistent.

3726
03:49:06,840 --> 03:49:07,280
He...

3727
03:49:07,280 --> 03:49:09,780
He said he needed to go rebuild a robot.

3728
03:49:10,500 --> 03:49:11,100
Oh, you know what?

3729
03:49:11,600 --> 03:49:11,840
Yeah.

3730
03:49:12,520 --> 03:49:13,800
Building a robot, you say.

3731
03:49:14,360 --> 03:49:16,340
Could that be why he needed that book?

3732
03:49:17,580 --> 03:49:18,000
Come again?

3733
03:49:18,520 --> 03:49:21,300
A young man with white hair and green glasses ran in
earlier.

3734
03:49:22,040 --> 03:49:22,800
That's Cedric, yeah.

3735
03:49:23,600 --> 03:49:25,400
He said he really needed a book from the back room.

3736
03:49:25,480 --> 03:49:26,640
Said it was an emergency, too.

3737
03:49:27,880 --> 03:49:29,540
Poor darling, looks so stressed out.

3738
03:49:29,720 --> 03:49:31,100
So I gave him the book.

3739
03:49:32,760 --> 03:49:33,940
I hope he's safe.

3740
03:49:34,240 --> 03:49:36,060
Suddenly he's southern accent.

3741
03:49:39,330 --> 03:49:41,030
Yeah, I hope he's alright too.

3742
03:49:42,770 --> 03:49:46,110
With any luck, maybe the lab complex can hold up long enough
for him to.

3743
03:49:48,430 --> 03:49:49,650
Oh my gosh.

3744
03:49:49,910 --> 03:49:50,810
What's happening?

3745
03:49:50,850 --> 03:49:52,070
That doesn't sound good at all.

3746
03:49:52,750 --> 03:49:53,270
It...

3747
03:49:53,270 --> 03:49:55,330
That was...

3748
03:49:55,330 --> 03:49:56,070
The labs?

3749
03:49:57,270 --> 03:49:58,350
That poor kid!

3750
03:50:00,930 --> 03:50:01,450
No.

3751
03:50:01,470 --> 03:50:13,650
him too oh my god everybody's dying around nico i'm sorry
about your friend the last time we spoke he told me to go

3752
03:50:13,650 --> 03:50:25,270
look for someone on the surface i i need to get going
sweetie oh sweetie you know we can't let you just walk into

3753
03:50:25,270 --> 03:50:35,070
danger what george is right the square seemed to be
targeting a lot of the weak constructs in the city only the

3754
03:50:35,070 --> 03:50:41,290
library has enough structural integrity to withstand
collapse it's best if you stay here until things stabilize I

3755
03:50:41,290 --> 03:50:49,750
don't think things are stabilizing however long that takes
what what what about my mission don't you guys want me to

3756
03:50:49,750 --> 03:50:57,770
bring the Sun back at least even if you do restore the Sun
I'm not sure that'll fix the squares sadly not to mention

3757
03:50:57,770 --> 03:51:06,110
even getting there's going to be hard if the world is like
this there's telling what's going on in the tower yeah the

3758
03:51:06,110 --> 03:51:14,250
world's gonna fall apart and if anything bad happens to the
Messiah of all people oh that would be so dreadful there a

3759
03:51:14,250 --> 03:51:22,410
friend of mine said something about this forever though it's
better for our world to die naturally oh silver no living

3760
03:51:22,410 --> 03:51:30,390
beings should have to carry that burden at the time I
thought it was still her faulty code speaking but now I

3761
03:51:31,470 --> 03:51:32,370
Trying to understand.

3762
03:51:34,710 --> 03:51:35,890
Messiah, I'm sorry.

3763
03:51:36,590 --> 03:51:37,470
I'm really, really sorry.

3764
03:51:37,530 --> 03:51:38,510
You can't block the doors.

3765
03:51:38,650 --> 03:51:39,750
You can't stop me from leaving.

3766
03:51:41,910 --> 03:51:44,290
All this time, we've burdened you with our hope, our faith.

3767
03:51:45,090 --> 03:51:47,690
Blissfully ignoring the fact that you are just a lost child.

3768
03:51:48,930 --> 03:51:51,410
Well, you're probably more scared than any of us, aren't
you?

3769
03:51:52,190 --> 03:51:54,450
We have been dealing with tragedy for so long.

3770
03:51:54,510 --> 03:51:56,270
It's become background noise for us now.

3771
03:51:57,050 --> 03:51:59,010
But for you, it must be so terrifying.

3772
03:51:59,710 --> 03:52:01,370
And now you're stuck here with the rest of us.

3773
03:52:01,470 --> 03:52:04,470
being held back by the very people you were told to save.

3774
03:52:08,510 --> 03:52:10,710
Sorry, we must seem so ungrateful.

3775
03:52:13,710 --> 03:52:14,210
It's...

3776
03:52:14,210 --> 03:52:14,890
Okay.

3777
03:52:16,090 --> 03:52:17,490
Nico is so brave.

3778
03:52:18,150 --> 03:52:20,110
Nico is so brave!

3779
03:52:21,570 --> 03:52:22,070
I...

3780
03:52:22,790 --> 03:52:26,490
When I first came to this world a long time ago...

3781
03:52:26,490 --> 03:52:28,730
Back then, all I wanted was to go home.

3782
03:52:32,050 --> 03:52:33,410
Adminto, do you remember?

3783
03:52:33,730 --> 03:52:34,930
Just looking at me.

3784
03:52:36,310 --> 03:52:37,650
The very first time?

3785
03:52:39,390 --> 03:52:41,350
I'm not sure how far back it was for you.

3786
03:52:41,970 --> 03:52:42,970
It was last year.

3787
03:52:43,870 --> 03:52:45,290
But I remember towards the end.

3788
03:52:46,190 --> 03:52:49,570
I actually wasn't sure anymore about going home.

3789
03:52:51,590 --> 03:52:54,350
Even knowing the world would be doomed eventually.

3790
03:52:55,330 --> 03:52:57,850
I still want the people here to be happy.

3791
03:52:58,710 --> 03:53:04,430
So when you told me to return the sun back then, And then I
didn't even question it.

3792
03:53:11,960 --> 03:53:13,880
Have you met La Llorona?

3793
03:53:14,180 --> 03:53:17,980
I very much look up to her, but I've not met her before.

3794
03:53:20,920 --> 03:53:22,800
But then I just came back.

3795
03:53:24,080 --> 03:53:24,580
You what?

3796
03:53:25,220 --> 03:53:28,000
And then I found out about the world being like this.

3797
03:53:30,500 --> 03:53:32,840
Prototype said to forget the things he told me.

3798
03:53:33,540 --> 03:53:35,220
And Cedric told me not to think about it too much.

3799
03:53:35,240 --> 03:53:47,760
but I'm sorry for getting upset at you back at the mines I
thought for you to know all that yet continue doing this it

3800
03:53:47,760 --> 03:53:59,720
just seems cruel but then I realized something you really
wanted to save both the world and me but at the end you can

3801
03:53:59,720 --> 03:54:00,840
only choose one, right?

3802
03:54:01,860 --> 03:54:04,420
Is it really hard for you two?

3803
03:54:05,180 --> 03:54:06,040
It must be.

3804
03:54:07,860 --> 03:54:10,620
If the world isn't broken, will that choice still be there?

3805
03:54:12,020 --> 03:54:14,560
Do you still need to choose between one or the other?

3806
03:54:16,260 --> 03:54:21,200
But even if it is, I really want to save this world at
Minto.

3807
03:54:22,080 --> 03:54:24,140
Even if it's more dangerous this time around.

3808
03:54:25,120 --> 03:54:29,120
Even if so many of the nice people we met were we're...

3809
03:54:31,500 --> 03:54:32,900
Let me don't!

3810
03:54:33,100 --> 03:54:35,040
I'm not afraid anymore.

3811
03:54:38,470 --> 03:54:39,490
Little baby!

3812
03:54:41,350 --> 03:54:44,190
That's why I think you guys should let me go.

3813
03:54:44,910 --> 03:54:46,290
I promise I'll be okay.

3814
03:54:47,090 --> 03:54:47,390
Please?

3815
03:54:51,140 --> 03:54:51,940
Aw, sweetie.

3816
03:54:52,640 --> 03:54:53,760
You are so brave.

3817
03:54:54,060 --> 03:54:55,680
Even braver than most grown-ups.

3818
03:54:56,720 --> 03:54:58,680
It wouldn't be right for us to keep you, would it?

3819
03:54:59,360 --> 03:55:02,380
Besides, how can I say no to those puppy doll guys?

3820
03:55:03,320 --> 03:55:09,020
Well, if George is fine with it, I guess we should let you
go now, Messiah.

3821
03:55:11,260 --> 03:55:12,820
But promise, they'll be careful, okay?

3822
03:55:13,840 --> 03:55:14,320
Mm-hmm.

3823
03:55:14,840 --> 03:55:16,200
You guys be safe, too.

3824
03:55:17,820 --> 03:55:18,500
Time to go!

3825
03:55:20,100 --> 03:55:20,900
Everybody's here.

3826
03:55:22,100 --> 03:55:24,100
Robots are the only ones that can send us...

3827
03:55:24,100 --> 03:55:25,640
That we can send out there now.

3828
03:55:26,220 --> 03:55:28,940
Thankfully, we still have a couple of units that aren't too
badly damaged.

3829
03:55:30,120 --> 03:55:30,520
Sigh.

3830
03:55:33,320 --> 03:55:34,640
You haven't had me, though, Messiah.

3831
03:55:35,160 --> 03:55:36,920
That's why I won't lose hope either.

3832
03:55:37,340 --> 03:55:37,640
Ah!

3833
03:55:40,940 --> 03:55:43,180
I like how you've given her a southern accent.

3834
03:55:43,320 --> 03:55:44,240
It fits, though, right?

3835
03:55:45,140 --> 03:55:48,020
For her, especially, to have the southern accent.

3836
03:55:51,020 --> 03:55:51,900
Oh, guys.

3837
03:55:52,240 --> 03:55:53,180
Oh, guys.

3838
03:55:53,340 --> 03:55:54,480
This guy's stressed.

3839
03:55:54,600 --> 03:55:54,960
Are you okay?

3840
03:55:55,580 --> 03:55:56,360
The world is ending!

3841
03:55:56,480 --> 03:55:57,260
What are we gonna do?

3842
03:56:00,600 --> 03:56:01,520
Extra, extra.

3843
03:56:02,180 --> 03:56:02,880
Evening news.

3844
03:56:03,020 --> 03:56:03,300
Evening news.

3845
03:56:03,320 --> 03:56:15,260
news everything is terrible reading helps me get my mind off
of things are the robots still still still scared still

3846
03:56:15,260 --> 03:56:26,160
scared of ladders hello person hi they are still reshelving
the world is ending they're just doing what they were

3847
03:56:26,160 --> 03:56:33,980
programmed to do what you need something suit yourself but
just so that you know Due to recent events, the restriction

3848
03:56:33,980 --> 03:56:36,880
on noise levels in the library has been temporarily lifted.

3849
03:56:37,560 --> 03:56:39,840
So I won't be kicking people out like before.

3850
03:56:41,680 --> 03:56:46,140
You think I'm going to be throwing out some evacuees just
because I'm a delinquent stuck doing community service?

3851
03:56:47,160 --> 03:56:47,400
No?

3852
03:56:47,900 --> 03:56:49,020
Good, because I'm not!

3853
03:56:50,000 --> 03:56:50,940
Who is this guy?

3854
03:56:51,160 --> 03:56:52,160
Okay, let's just go.

3855
03:56:54,460 --> 03:56:55,540
Wait, what did the robot say?

3856
03:56:56,300 --> 03:56:56,900
Hello, person.

3857
03:56:57,260 --> 03:56:59,420
This is the library slash temporary shelter.

3858
03:57:06,330 --> 03:57:07,170
This way, uh...

3859
03:57:07,590 --> 03:57:09,030
No, we gotta go down.

3860
03:57:10,290 --> 03:57:10,910
Down and around.

3861
03:57:16,230 --> 03:57:17,050
We got the stars.

3862
03:57:17,850 --> 03:57:19,090
We're gonna save the world.

3863
03:57:19,610 --> 03:57:21,070
Oh, that's not good.

3864
03:57:21,550 --> 03:57:23,190
Wait, that's not the...

3865
03:57:23,770 --> 03:57:25,010
We need the...

3866
03:57:25,010 --> 03:57:25,750
Here, here, here, here.

3867
03:57:26,110 --> 03:57:27,030
Oh, that's not good.

3868
03:57:28,670 --> 03:57:30,650
Wait, what about that guy and his cats?

3869
03:57:31,770 --> 03:57:32,930
Please tell me he's still here.

3870
03:57:35,370 --> 03:57:36,950
Where are the cats?

3871
03:57:40,570 --> 03:57:42,130
The guy and his cats.

3872
03:57:42,230 --> 03:57:42,870
Please,

3873
03:57:47,270 --> 03:57:48,390
do not approach.

3874
03:57:51,690 --> 03:57:52,850
Was it in here?

3875
03:57:56,550 --> 03:57:57,910
I don't think so.

3876
03:57:59,150 --> 03:58:00,830
There was another alleyway.

3877
03:58:02,270 --> 03:58:04,060
Maybe it was back in there and I missed it.

3878
03:58:09,520 --> 03:58:11,260
Oh, the little stalls are gone!

3879
03:58:11,880 --> 03:58:13,640
If they were here, actually I don't remember.

3880
03:58:20,330 --> 03:58:21,670
Maybe up here?

3881
03:58:23,610 --> 03:58:24,570
Oh, yes.

3882
03:58:28,340 --> 03:58:29,480
You're here!

3883
03:58:30,120 --> 03:58:30,440
Nico!

3884
03:58:31,240 --> 03:58:32,740
Are you... are you Rue?

3885
03:58:33,900 --> 03:58:34,500
Yes.

3886
03:58:35,180 --> 03:58:36,640
Did you already meet the others?

3887
03:58:37,340 --> 03:58:38,620
Yeah, but...

3888
03:58:38,620 --> 03:58:39,820
Everything is...

3889
03:58:39,820 --> 03:58:40,700
Is in place then.

3890
03:58:41,300 --> 03:58:42,880
Come on, let's go back to the clock room.

3891
03:58:43,560 --> 03:58:43,680
Oh.

3892
03:58:44,500 --> 03:58:44,980
Oh, okay.

3893
03:58:46,680 --> 03:58:47,280
Uh...

3894
03:58:47,280 --> 03:58:49,380
I'm gonna fast travel.

3895
03:58:51,240 --> 03:58:52,120
Elevator Street.

3896
03:58:56,100 --> 03:58:57,020
Wait, is it this one?

3897
03:58:59,040 --> 03:58:59,740
Where am I?

3898
03:59:04,120 --> 03:59:06,400
Wait, I have to go back to the tower, no?

3899
03:59:07,940 --> 03:59:08,740
Was it this way?

3900
03:59:10,440 --> 03:59:12,320
Look how cute she is!

3901
03:59:13,360 --> 03:59:14,420
Squares are here too!

3902
03:59:14,840 --> 03:59:16,100
Okay, uh...

3903
03:59:19,740 --> 03:59:21,880
Yeah, squares can't get you if you're fast traveling.

3904
03:59:24,460 --> 03:59:24,940
Literal...

3905
03:59:28,160 --> 03:59:28,960
Life hack.

3906
03:59:30,720 --> 03:59:34,760
How do I go up the elevator, though?

3907
03:59:35,120 --> 03:59:35,720
Everything was broken.

3908
03:59:44,300 --> 03:59:46,160
Let's go back to the elevator straight.

3909
03:59:55,460 --> 03:59:57,480
Which way was the tower?

3910
03:59:57,540 --> 03:59:58,660
Wait, the tower is down.

3911
04:00:05,150 --> 04:00:08,430
I feel like all the elevators were taken over, no?

3912
04:00:13,870 --> 04:00:14,390
Like...

3913
04:00:14,390 --> 04:00:17,710
Maybe I talked to them.

3914
04:00:18,330 --> 04:00:20,010
Hello, is there another elevator?

3915
04:00:24,750 --> 04:00:25,830
Is there another elevator?

3916
04:00:28,650 --> 04:00:30,110
Please be careful out there.

3917
04:00:31,850 --> 04:00:33,930
Oh, um, what book did Cedric take?

3918
04:00:34,490 --> 04:00:36,290
The creation of Prophetbot, dear.

3919
04:00:36,950 --> 04:00:38,870
It's one of my favorite books by the author.

3920
04:00:39,390 --> 04:00:42,210
The book contains many detailed blueprints and progress
shots.

3921
04:00:42,710 --> 04:00:44,350
I really enjoyed editing it.

3922
04:00:45,530 --> 04:00:47,710
There's only two elevators, which means it should be
scripted.

3923
04:00:51,170 --> 04:01:05,890
yeah there were two elevators in the room you're right but I
don't remember how to get to the tower wasn't here I

3924
04:01:16,950 --> 04:01:25,230
thought this was the room to the tower no but we can't get
in let's see yeah

3925
04:01:30,340 --> 04:01:45,840
I guess I'll go up through here and try a different way
let's see I wish I had a map I don't know the other elevator

3926
04:01:45,840 --> 04:01:57,360
there were two ways to get to the tower there were sit down
around here

3927
04:02:11,170 --> 04:02:11,690
Nice.

3928
04:02:13,830 --> 04:02:15,150
We found it, team.

3929
04:02:16,370 --> 04:02:17,930
Why couldn't I fast travel here?

3930
04:02:22,810 --> 04:02:24,490
Let's see if this elevator works.

3931
04:02:31,670 --> 04:02:32,410
Oh my gosh, wait.

3932
04:02:32,510 --> 04:02:34,370
Do all three of them need to be standing on these?

3933
04:02:34,970 --> 04:02:36,330
And then purple is Nico.

3934
04:02:39,190 --> 04:02:40,450
Blue is Prophet.

3935
04:02:41,230 --> 04:02:41,430
Right?

3936
04:02:41,570 --> 04:02:42,970
Red is Rue.

3937
04:02:43,310 --> 04:02:44,790
Where are the other two?

3938
04:02:45,850 --> 04:02:46,310
Prototype.

3939
04:02:47,010 --> 04:02:47,470
Cedric.

3940
04:02:48,110 --> 04:02:49,230
They're supposed to be here already.

3941
04:02:51,730 --> 04:02:52,190
They...

3942
04:02:52,190 --> 04:02:54,790
Prototype's body was destroyed back in the barons.

3943
04:02:56,110 --> 04:02:58,630
Cedric was going to bring him back with the memory disk,
but...

3944
04:02:58,630 --> 04:03:00,650
He was in the lab complex when it collapsed.

3945
04:03:03,270 --> 04:03:04,770
I don't think he made it.

3946
04:03:06,070 --> 04:03:06,350
Oh.

3947
04:03:06,950 --> 04:03:07,270
No.

3948
04:03:09,480 --> 04:03:09,920
No!

3949
04:03:10,100 --> 04:03:11,420
There goes our only chance.

3950
04:03:12,560 --> 04:03:12,960
I...

3951
04:03:12,960 --> 04:03:13,580
I'm sorry.

3952
04:03:13,980 --> 04:03:15,060
It's not your fault, Niko.

3953
04:03:15,640 --> 04:03:17,640
If anything, I should be apologizing to you.

3954
04:03:17,660 --> 04:03:27,700
you there's one last thing i want to do what if it's maybe
that centric just doesn't know how to get back up here come

3955
04:03:27,700 --> 04:03:38,120
on let's go upstairs oh my oh my god that guy is still like
chilling in the in the elevator

3956
04:03:44,280 --> 04:03:52,580
centric might be just hiking up the building you guys he's
taking a whole a whole robot you know This is the tallest

3957
04:03:52,580 --> 04:03:53,800
building in the refuge.

3958
04:03:54,920 --> 04:03:56,400
It's my favorite place in the world.

3959
04:03:57,160 --> 04:03:57,740
In this world.

3960
04:03:58,780 --> 04:04:04,680
I like to look at the far-off buildings and imagine what
kind of lives I might be behind each of the windows.

3961
04:04:08,280 --> 04:04:09,660
Can you lift me on?

3962
04:04:09,700 --> 04:04:10,740
Don't do it, Ril!

3963
04:04:11,580 --> 04:04:12,660
Don't do it!

3964
04:04:14,880 --> 04:04:16,600
Can you lift me on to the banister?

3965
04:04:18,020 --> 04:04:19,480
I want to get a better look.

3966
04:04:31,710 --> 04:04:34,770
It was depressing for me at first too, you know.

3967
04:04:35,570 --> 04:04:36,990
Knowing how all this is well.

3968
04:04:37,910 --> 04:04:37,910
Fake?

3969
04:04:38,670 --> 04:04:39,190
Simulated.

3970
04:04:40,790 --> 04:04:43,190
Cedric told me about what happened to your old world.

3971
04:04:44,170 --> 04:04:44,530
Did he?

3972
04:04:45,190 --> 04:04:46,810
I'm really sorry about that.

3973
04:04:47,950 --> 04:04:49,550
I can't imagine how you must feel.

3974
04:04:50,710 --> 04:04:53,050
I had this as my desktop wallpaper for so long.

3975
04:04:53,130 --> 04:04:54,070
It's so nice!

3976
04:04:55,370 --> 04:04:57,670
The feeling of never being able to go home again.

3977
04:04:58,590 --> 04:05:01,710
That's probably not all that different from your play, is
it?

3978
04:05:02,670 --> 04:05:05,110
This time, though, we haven't really had any, like...

3979
04:05:05,110 --> 04:05:09,730
I mean, I've looked in my documents a little bit, but we
haven't had any, like, real meta pop-ups or anything like

3980
04:05:09,730 --> 04:05:10,030
that.

3981
04:05:12,550 --> 04:05:13,830
It really is ironic.

3982
04:05:14,650 --> 04:05:19,250
You're prevented from going home by the same individual who
never wanted to bring you here.

3983
04:05:20,830 --> 04:05:21,090
Huh?

3984
04:05:21,770 --> 04:05:22,530
Who would that be?

3985
04:05:23,270 --> 04:05:24,070
The World Machine.

3986
04:05:24,990 --> 04:05:27,670
You might know it as the entity for the entity.

3987
04:05:28,370 --> 04:05:31,310
Oh, the entity does sound familiar.

3988
04:05:32,270 --> 04:05:34,590
I think I heard it from the Dice Lady from another time.

3989
04:05:35,670 --> 04:05:36,770
Was it the spirit of the world?

3990
04:05:37,670 --> 04:05:37,970
Yes.

3991
04:05:39,290 --> 04:05:44,630
But thing is, the world machine was only built to run on the
mental abilities of someone else.

3992
04:05:45,550 --> 04:05:47,910
It was never meant to develop a mind of its own.

3993
04:05:52,690 --> 04:05:53,990
Ad Minto is pretty silent.

3994
04:05:54,130 --> 04:05:56,570
Yeah, we're not doing much.

3995
04:06:03,660 --> 04:06:07,500
My creators specialize in artificial intelligence for so
long.

3996
04:06:07,940 --> 04:06:08,960
Not the AI.

3997
04:06:10,040 --> 04:06:12,020
It was simply ingrained in his work.

3998
04:06:13,980 --> 04:06:17,100
And all machines are built with a fundamental law.

3999
04:06:17,540 --> 04:06:19,820
Never let a living being come to harm.

4000
04:06:22,060 --> 04:06:28,740
From the world's machine, world machines perspective, it has
too violated its deepest, most foundational instinct.

4001
04:06:29,640 --> 04:06:30,820
It has to put a living...

4002
04:06:30,820 --> 04:06:31,680
It has...

4003
04:06:31,680 --> 04:06:33,000
Wait, it has to put a living...

4004
04:06:33,020 --> 04:06:34,960
person in danger.

4005
04:06:37,180 --> 04:06:41,000
It has to bring a real person into a dying world that isn't
even real.

4006
04:06:42,540 --> 04:06:45,320
Of course, the simulation never contained any real danger.

4007
04:06:47,100 --> 04:06:47,120
Spooky.

4008
04:06:53,840 --> 04:06:57,420
The eventual intended ending was meant to be a happy one.

4009
04:06:58,180 --> 04:06:59,720
But the world machine doesn't know that.

4010
04:07:01,100 --> 04:07:01,660
Really?

4011
04:07:01,660 --> 04:07:02,220
Unfortunately.

4012
04:07:02,980 --> 04:07:06,180
Sentient machines tend to handle conflicts in their code
very badly.

4013
04:07:13,450 --> 04:07:17,270
The central conflict triggered a self-destructive downward
spiral.

4014
04:07:17,970 --> 04:07:19,110
Hope your headaches aren't too bad anymore.

4015
04:07:19,530 --> 04:07:20,110
Not so bad.

4016
04:07:20,230 --> 04:07:20,910
Not so bad.

4017
04:07:21,730 --> 04:07:24,090
I'm able to be here.

4018
04:07:30,680 --> 04:07:34,400
You can see physical manifestations of that everywhere now.

4019
04:07:35,480 --> 04:07:36,660
Thanks for asking, by the way.

4020
04:07:38,620 --> 04:07:39,220
The squares.

4021
04:07:40,220 --> 04:07:42,260
That's the world machine corrupting its own code.

4022
04:07:42,840 --> 04:07:47,180
My creator says, it's largely an involuntary process induced
by stress.

4023
04:07:47,200 --> 04:07:49,520
and the desire to self-terminate.

4024
04:07:49,840 --> 04:07:50,900
Oh my god.

4025
04:07:52,440 --> 04:07:53,460
Your creator knows?

4026
04:07:54,080 --> 04:07:56,800
Sounds like this has been going on since the beginning,
then.

4027
04:07:57,200 --> 04:07:57,380
Yeah.

4028
04:08:01,340 --> 04:08:03,880
The disruption was an issue during test runs even.

4029
04:08:05,160 --> 04:08:08,840
At first, my creator thought the instability was due to the
sheer scope of the project.

4030
04:08:09,280 --> 04:08:16,420
But just before we continue, since we talked about how the
first part of the game was so, like, meta and everything,

4031
04:08:16,520 --> 04:08:23,800
and this part's a little more like, this part, I could do a
little less with like how lord dumpy and heavy it is

4032
04:08:23,800 --> 04:08:38,840
sometimes it's just a lot of text for me to read i think but
yeah but i'm still enjoying it obviously at first my creator

4033
04:08:38,840 --> 04:08:46,240
thought the instability was due to the sheer scope of the
project he spent most of his remaining time testing it over

4034
04:08:46,240 --> 04:08:49,560
and over again scaling down the story reiterating the
narrative narrative.

4035
04:08:50,800 --> 04:08:52,280
Wasn't expecting it to be this different.

4036
04:08:52,400 --> 04:08:53,700
Yeah, me neither, right?

4037
04:08:56,020 --> 04:09:02,100
By the time he realized the actual root of the problem, our
homeworld's remaining lifespan was measured in mere days.

4038
04:09:05,320 --> 04:09:08,060
Extremely meta as to the nature of the world, less meta in
gameplay.

4039
04:09:08,400 --> 04:09:09,560
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

4040
04:09:14,080 --> 04:09:17,720
Oh, is there any way for us to fix the world machine?

4041
04:09:18,400 --> 04:09:19,080
We tried.

4042
04:09:19,740 --> 04:09:28,680
The world machine doesn't believe are real myself included
the odds are against us we have no chance of taming it

4043
04:09:28,680 --> 04:09:36,900
taming I've heard that word so many times I only know it's
complicated it has to do with robots but for once I want to

4044
04:09:36,900 --> 04:09:47,100
know what it really means that's what I'm here for do you
know what a robot is robot no yeah wait no I mean do you

4045
04:09:47,100 --> 04:09:48,500
know what a robot is.

4046
04:09:53,950 --> 04:09:56,590
Um, a robot is not a real person, is it?

4047
04:09:56,670 --> 04:09:57,250
Oh my gosh.

4048
04:09:58,090 --> 04:10:00,190
Don't tell David Cage.

4049
04:10:00,610 --> 04:10:02,570
He made Detroit become human.

4050
04:10:05,270 --> 04:10:06,750
They became human!

4051
04:10:09,470 --> 04:10:10,270
Robot.

4052
04:10:13,190 --> 04:10:13,990
Right.

4053
04:10:16,450 --> 04:10:19,630
It's a being whose entire existence is code.

4054
04:10:20,530 --> 04:10:22,210
What is brain?

4055
04:10:22,590 --> 04:10:26,450
What is the neurons of the brain, if not code?

4056
04:10:29,190 --> 04:10:33,410
In flexible programming with thoughts dictated by someone
else's design.

4057
04:10:40,870 --> 04:10:41,470
Contacts.

4058
04:10:41,890 --> 04:10:46,610
They can be copied, they can be mass-produced, then can be
assigned to all sorts of jobs.

4059
04:10:48,990 --> 04:10:51,110
Yeah, DNA is still code.

4060
04:10:52,110 --> 04:10:53,550
If you think about it.

4061
04:10:54,750 --> 04:10:58,670
And most importantly, they will never confuse themselves
with the living.

4062
04:10:59,630 --> 04:11:01,730
They will always be bound by their code.

4063
04:11:02,110 --> 04:11:03,990
The knowledge that they are a robot.

4064
04:11:05,110 --> 04:11:07,030
I am a robot.

4065
04:11:07,570 --> 04:11:08,630
Get rid of them contacts.

4066
04:11:09,990 --> 04:11:11,410
I, oh my gosh.

4067
04:11:11,530 --> 04:11:16,150
I actually ordered new contacts today because these ones
have been like, I got these ones in Japan.

4068
04:11:17,290 --> 04:11:19,950
And they are not agreeing with my eyeballs.

4069
04:11:23,990 --> 04:11:27,210
But this was more of a limitation than anything else.

4070
04:11:27,830 --> 04:11:28,510
That makes sense.

4071
04:11:29,030 --> 04:11:32,050
You can't really build a robot to not follow its own code,
can you?

4072
04:11:32,770 --> 04:11:35,110
People have tried, but it's a recipe for disaster.

4073
04:11:36,190 --> 04:11:36,530
Terminator.

4074
04:11:37,810 --> 04:11:38,310
Terminator!

4075
04:11:39,710 --> 04:11:41,750
In a way, that's what happened to the world machine.

4076
04:11:43,870 --> 04:11:44,470
My brad.

4077
04:11:46,070 --> 04:11:47,530
Need to hit up your eye doctor soon?

4078
04:11:48,050 --> 04:11:48,810
Get to it!

4079
04:11:50,430 --> 04:12:05,930
go get your eyes checked yeah you're saying me to cuto you
need to go check your prescription what are humans if not

4080
04:12:05,930 --> 04:12:17,670
meat robots I'm following my code which is go to work slave
away go home watch breaking bad sleep wake up go to work

4081
04:12:17,670 --> 04:12:30,510
slave away go home watch breaking bad sleep don't you work
from home shh it's for the simulation

4082
04:12:34,690 --> 04:12:42,650
the code conflicts thing yeah but while you can't build a
robot to not follow its code you can establish a special

4083
04:12:42,650 --> 04:12:49,390
bond with it if the strength of that bond is strong enough
the robot's mental capacity will start to develop outside of

4084
04:12:49,390 --> 04:12:50,410
its program programming.

4085
04:12:51,850 --> 04:12:53,050
Sleep, work, Mito, repeat.

4086
04:12:53,490 --> 04:12:54,490
Sleep, work, Mito, repeat.

4087
04:12:54,950 --> 04:12:56,370
Sleep, work, Saul Goodman, repeat.

4088
04:12:56,730 --> 04:12:58,010
Sleep, work, Saul Goodman, repeat.

4089
04:13:00,190 --> 04:13:04,650
My optometrist says I have corrected 2020 vision and I say
Mito, Quito.

4090
04:13:07,610 --> 04:13:08,790
I think you need a second opinion.

4091
04:13:13,340 --> 04:13:16,540
In a way, it's starting to believe itself as a real, valid
individual.

4092
04:13:18,260 --> 04:13:22,120
Oh my god, it's getting reverse psychosis, you know, like
the AI psychosis.

4093
04:13:22,820 --> 04:13:24,560
It's getting that, but to itself.

4094
04:13:25,380 --> 04:13:27,940
It's a complete suspension of disbelief on your end, though.

4095
04:13:30,880 --> 04:13:34,020
You have to fully embrace the robot as a genuine living
person.

4096
04:13:35,800 --> 04:13:37,200
Even though they are not.

4097
04:13:39,000 --> 04:13:41,020
How much do you guys think I have left of the game, by the
way?

4098
04:13:41,320 --> 04:13:42,040
I'm just curious.

4099
04:13:42,980 --> 04:13:44,260
You need to spend a lot of time with it.

4100
04:13:44,400 --> 04:13:45,280
Treat it like a good friend.

4101
04:13:45,440 --> 04:13:47,300
I feel like I'm at the end, but...

4102
04:13:47,300 --> 04:13:50,080
Devoting your heart to the robot until it is able to return
your feelings.

4103
04:13:52,140 --> 04:13:54,440
Haha, I make it sound so easy, don't I?

4104
04:13:55,260 --> 04:13:55,880
Tail end?

4105
04:13:55,960 --> 04:13:56,940
An hour max?

4106
04:13:57,040 --> 04:13:58,380
Okay, cool.

4107
04:14:00,140 --> 04:14:02,600
Like, you and Adminto know better than anyone that it's not.

4108
04:14:03,380 --> 04:14:05,820
Right now, the world machine is probably really, really
scared.

4109
04:14:06,720 --> 04:14:09,740
This content update involves some pretty deep code work.

4110
04:14:10,080 --> 04:14:10,760
Not the update.

4111
04:14:11,360 --> 04:14:15,520
Not the new game plot is freaking the spook in the machine.

4112
04:14:16,780 --> 04:14:19,700
My creator was able to access some of the source code, you
know.

4113
04:14:22,140 --> 04:14:24,860
way he could and establish new connections between maps.

4114
04:14:28,880 --> 04:14:33,800
I seem to recall the optometrist also telling me I didn't
need glasses because Minto Kuto, how strange.

4115
04:14:34,640 --> 04:14:36,220
100% of optometrists agree.

4116
04:14:37,880 --> 04:14:40,240
You're wearing rose-colored glasses.

4117
04:14:43,260 --> 04:14:45,460
Those links enable you to meet the other two.

4118
04:14:46,320 --> 04:14:51,420
But as it turns out, the new code confused the world machine
to such an extent that it's breaking down altogether.

4119
04:14:52,520 --> 04:14:54,280
Green-colored glasses.

4120
04:14:55,220 --> 04:14:57,220
Mint-colored glasses.

4121
04:15:01,120 --> 04:15:05,060
Even though the World Machine always had self-destructive
tendencies.

4122
04:15:05,300 --> 04:15:07,440
Why is the World Machine so menhara?

4123
04:15:09,160 --> 04:15:11,580
Why were you coded to be like this?

4124
04:15:12,520 --> 04:15:15,360
It usually restrains itself when you are in the world.

4125
04:15:19,650 --> 04:15:21,750
It doesn't want to take you along with it.

4126
04:15:25,210 --> 04:15:27,370
All my creator wanted was to write a happy ending.

4127
04:15:27,970 --> 04:15:35,710
right now the only hope of saving you is to take you through
that ending but now the other two are gone I don't even know

4128
04:15:35,710 --> 04:15:54,560
how we're gonna get you there oh no we should go even this
place is no longer safe it never was they're here you guys

4129
04:15:54,560 --> 04:16:02,040
are okay yep when the factory started collapsing I really
thought we didn't have a chance fortunately the robot

4130
04:16:02,040 --> 04:16:08,180
assembly rooms were pretty built were built pretty tough and
it actually did not take me long to bring proto back all

4131
04:16:08,180 --> 04:16:16,220
thanks to father's book she had made my decision my design
documents to be compatible with the assembly machines there

4132
04:16:16,220 --> 04:16:25,180
all i had to do was scan in the blueprints and reconfigure
some machine settings nice walk and talk please i know stop

4133
04:16:25,180 --> 04:16:34,680
standing there everything is turning too square we need we
need to hurry father really does think of everything daddy

4134
04:16:34,680 --> 04:16:44,160
does i'm just glad everyone is okay same we're ready to go
now nico yeah oh my god the gang's all here

4135
04:16:49,760 --> 04:16:55,960
let's just stand here and talk until everything is
collapsing oh this This is...

4136
04:16:55,960 --> 04:16:58,420
No wonder he wanted all of us to be here for this.

4137
04:16:59,880 --> 04:17:01,700
So I go on the mint one.

4138
04:17:02,840 --> 04:17:03,920
What are these things anyway?

4139
04:17:05,120 --> 04:17:06,060
Code portals.

4140
04:17:06,640 --> 04:17:09,000
They temporarily remove us from the world.

4141
04:17:10,580 --> 04:17:10,820
What?

4142
04:17:11,300 --> 04:17:12,740
It's a bit hard to explain.

4143
04:17:12,920 --> 04:17:13,680
Yeah, I'm confused.

4144
04:17:14,140 --> 04:17:20,220
Basically, my father has hidden a description key in our
code with a TXT file as it's show.

4145
04:17:20,980 --> 04:17:24,740
But to get to them, we have to be removed from the world and
decompiled.

4146
04:17:26,580 --> 04:17:35,300
They were densest to all along When our keys are combined
into a central location It will activate an encrypted part

4147
04:17:35,300 --> 04:17:44,240
of this world Which will Confused cat noises Real, maybe
it's better if you explain I'll attempt Basically these

4148
04:17:44,240 --> 04:17:55,000
portals all represent a physical location on Adminto's
machine Okay, okay, okay Cool Pink and green and blue When

4149
04:17:55,000 --> 04:17:59,540
we enter those portals, we will be sent to that location,
wherever that is.

4150
04:18:01,620 --> 04:18:05,840
I'm sure Adminto is already pretty familiar with retrieving
puzzle pieces from this world on their computer.

4151
04:18:07,460 --> 04:18:13,100
But this time Adminto would need to move around some things
as well, specifically by moving the keys from the small

4152
04:18:13,100 --> 04:18:14,240
portal to the big one.

4153
04:18:15,020 --> 04:18:16,500
I don't know what happens next though.

4154
04:18:17,400 --> 04:18:17,980
I see.

4155
04:18:18,940 --> 04:18:19,780
And red!

4156
04:18:23,240 --> 04:18:24,860
Does Adminto know where these portals are?

4157
04:18:24,880 --> 04:18:28,280
You should probably ask Adminto on this.

4158
04:18:28,760 --> 04:18:29,000
Right.

4159
04:18:33,120 --> 04:18:33,680
Hold on.

4160
04:18:34,640 --> 04:18:35,680
It's glowing.

4161
04:18:36,280 --> 04:18:39,720
The journal is glowing again, Adminto.

4162
04:18:42,350 --> 04:18:43,450
Uh, oh.

4163
04:18:45,730 --> 04:18:46,530
Documents.

4164
04:18:46,830 --> 04:18:47,570
My games.

4165
04:18:48,010 --> 04:18:48,470
One shot.

4166
04:18:51,890 --> 04:18:53,110
Thank you.

4167
04:18:57,150 --> 04:18:57,950
Thanks.

4168
04:18:58,750 --> 04:18:59,110
Thanks.

4169
04:18:59,110 --> 04:18:59,730
Thanks.

4170
04:18:59,830 --> 04:19:01,830
Thank you.

4171
04:19:03,810 --> 04:19:05,150
I'm all ready.

4172
04:19:05,610 --> 04:19:07,510
Here, I'll even... I will just do that, yeah.

4173
04:19:15,550 --> 04:19:16,710
This one is red.

4174
04:19:17,410 --> 04:19:18,710
This one will be meant for me, then.

4175
04:19:21,950 --> 04:19:23,150
This one is blue.

4176
04:19:23,750 --> 04:19:24,710
That's mine, then.

4177
04:19:27,570 --> 04:19:28,990
This one is green.

4178
04:19:29,650 --> 04:19:30,690
That's mine, then.

4179
04:19:54,960 --> 04:19:56,100
That one's mine!

4180
04:20:03,120 --> 04:20:03,940
Okie dokie.

4181
04:20:05,300 --> 04:20:06,740
Let's let him take his place.

4182
04:20:07,980 --> 04:20:09,800
This one is configured to my code, I think.

4183
04:20:11,040 --> 04:20:11,720
And poipul.

4184
04:20:14,780 --> 04:20:15,200
Hello?

4185
04:20:16,980 --> 04:20:17,400
Hello?

4186
04:20:17,960 --> 04:20:18,420
What the...

4187
04:20:18,420 --> 04:20:19,740
No, what am I supposed to do?

4188
04:20:21,260 --> 04:20:21,540
Hello?

4189
04:20:22,880 --> 04:20:25,120
Oh, dude, now I do the documents thing.

4190
04:20:25,380 --> 04:20:25,940
Okay, okay, okay.

4191
04:20:26,560 --> 04:20:27,420
Uh, whoops, wrong mouse.

4192
04:20:28,040 --> 04:20:28,520
There we go.

4193
04:20:31,100 --> 04:20:31,520
Oh!

4194
04:20:31,520 --> 04:20:31,560
Oh!

4195
04:20:31,580 --> 04:20:32,280
Portal 1!

4196
04:20:33,620 --> 04:20:34,140
Whoa!

4197
04:20:36,520 --> 04:20:37,180
Key B.

4198
04:20:37,700 --> 04:20:39,380
Put me in the big portal.

4199
04:20:41,300 --> 04:20:41,820
Okay.

4200
04:20:44,960 --> 04:20:45,720
Oh, wait.

4201
04:20:45,840 --> 04:20:46,480
I have to put you...

4202
04:20:46,480 --> 04:20:47,080
Oh, okay, okay.

4203
04:20:47,260 --> 04:20:48,020
I get it in here.

4204
04:20:48,140 --> 04:20:48,800
Oh, big portal.

4205
04:20:53,160 --> 04:20:55,140
Put me in the big portal.

4206
04:20:58,460 --> 04:20:59,520
Oh, what's...

4207
04:20:59,520 --> 04:21:00,300
Portal 2?

4208
04:21:01,280 --> 04:21:03,120
Put me in the big portal.

4209
04:21:04,380 --> 04:21:05,880
It's so funny.

4210
04:21:12,900 --> 04:21:13,280
Put me...

4211
04:21:13,280 --> 04:21:14,660
Wait, do I do just the TXT?

4212
04:21:14,900 --> 04:21:16,180
I feel like that's it.

4213
04:21:16,200 --> 04:21:20,000
They said the TXT file, so...

4214
04:21:20,000 --> 04:21:20,480
Right?

4215
04:21:20,840 --> 04:21:22,220
If not, I'll just, you know.

4216
04:21:22,640 --> 04:21:24,120
Put me in the big portal.

4217
04:21:24,420 --> 04:21:25,400
Oh, they're gone!

4218
04:21:25,800 --> 04:21:26,700
Oh my gosh.

4219
04:21:29,200 --> 04:21:30,000
What about...

4220
04:21:35,270 --> 04:21:36,610
Oh, wait, I did the wrong one.

4221
04:21:37,110 --> 04:21:37,890
Oh, that's why.

4222
04:21:37,950 --> 04:21:38,490
I was like, hello?

4223
04:21:38,850 --> 04:21:39,410
Oh, whoops.

4224
04:21:39,430 --> 04:21:42,050
I'm breaking the game.

4225
04:21:43,610 --> 04:21:44,350
Thank you, guys.

4226
04:21:45,030 --> 04:21:45,090
Oh.

4227
04:21:47,330 --> 04:21:47,450
Oh.

4228
04:21:49,390 --> 04:21:50,510
Oh, I made a door.

4229
04:21:54,250 --> 04:21:54,670
Whoa.

4230
04:21:55,530 --> 04:21:56,830
That was fun.

4231
04:21:58,010 --> 04:21:58,810
Hold on.

4232
04:21:59,770 --> 04:22:01,950
Put me in the big portal.

4233
04:22:05,470 --> 04:22:07,850
I made a doctor.

4234
04:22:08,610 --> 04:22:09,410
Oh.

4235
04:22:09,430 --> 04:22:10,330
Whoa.

4236
04:22:13,030 --> 04:22:13,170
Oh!

4237
04:22:13,410 --> 04:22:13,990
Everybody's here!

4238
04:22:14,390 --> 04:22:15,570
That was quite peculiar.

4239
04:22:16,490 --> 04:22:17,070
I'll say.

4240
04:22:19,230 --> 04:22:20,430
Hey, this is...

4241
04:22:21,170 --> 04:22:22,030
Papa's room.

4242
04:22:22,670 --> 04:22:24,150
Put me in the big portal.

4243
04:22:24,970 --> 04:22:26,230
It's so funny.

4244
04:22:28,130 --> 04:22:29,770
The world machine.

4245
04:22:32,870 --> 04:22:34,390
Little Miss Menhara.

4246
04:22:36,130 --> 04:22:37,950
It's a big book on the table.

4247
04:22:39,690 --> 04:22:42,270
Minto, I'm going to need you to put me in the big portal.

4248
04:22:43,970 --> 04:22:50,970
What if I just have a stream where I make TXT files of
everybody in chat and I move you all to the big portal?

4249
04:22:55,000 --> 04:22:56,800
Wait, I can do it right now.

4250
04:22:57,540 --> 04:22:59,200
I can do it right now.

4251
04:23:01,000 --> 04:23:01,800
Wait, how do I?

4252
04:23:01,980 --> 04:23:02,400
Hold on.

4253
04:23:04,180 --> 04:23:05,860
I don't know if anything will show up.

4254
04:23:05,960 --> 04:23:06,800
Wait, let me just...

4255
04:23:08,500 --> 04:23:09,060

4259
04:23:45,600 --> 04:23:46,780
Pin to taskbar.

4260
04:23:47,060 --> 04:23:48,180
I'm kind of a genius, guys.

4261
04:23:49,860 --> 04:23:50,800
Okay, here we go.

4262
04:23:51,060 --> 04:23:51,100
Whoops.

4263
04:23:52,380 --> 04:23:53,100
I'm kind of a genius.

4264
04:23:58,060 --> 04:24:00,140
Colonel, I need you to put me in the big portal.

4265
04:24:00,380 --> 04:24:02,040
Everybody can go into the big portal.

4266
04:24:02,280 --> 04:24:02,940
All right, ready for this?

4267
04:24:04,440 --> 04:24:04,660
Oh.

4268
04:24:05,360 --> 04:24:05,960
Oh, no!

4269
04:24:06,060 --> 04:24:06,800
I need to use...

4270
04:24:13,820 --> 04:24:14,540
Save us.

4271
04:24:15,980 --> 04:24:16,860
My games.

4272
04:24:17,460 --> 04:24:18,140
One shot.

4273
04:24:20,020 --> 04:24:21,080
Oh, I had to do it again.

4274
04:24:27,940 --> 04:24:29,620
Put me in the big portal.

4275
04:24:37,390 --> 04:24:39,050
Put me in the big portal.

4276
04:24:40,690 --> 04:24:42,370
Okay, we gotta finish the game, guys.

4277
04:24:42,750 --> 04:24:43,010
Sorry.

4278
04:24:43,330 --> 04:24:44,230
I did one for the bit.

4279
04:24:45,350 --> 04:24:48,110
Not me jumping out of bed to be put in the big portal.

4280
04:24:50,710 --> 04:24:51,150
Okay.

4281
04:24:52,070 --> 04:24:52,550
Okay.

4282
04:24:54,430 --> 04:24:55,430
Okay, barn.

4283
04:25:02,180 --> 04:25:07,080
I have to use a separate mouse or separate, uh, what's the
word?

4284
04:25:08,320 --> 04:25:09,320
Keyboard for this.

4285
04:25:09,660 --> 04:25:10,960
Put you in the big portal.

4286
04:25:14,200 --> 04:25:16,100
Put me in Harvester.

4287
04:25:17,040 --> 04:25:17,400
Wait, how?

4288
04:25:17,640 --> 04:25:18,200
Wait, look at it.

4289
04:25:18,420 --> 04:25:18,800
Everybody.

4290
04:25:22,640 --> 04:25:23,120
Wait.

4291
04:25:23,980 --> 04:25:24,320
Wait.

4292
04:25:24,820 --> 04:25:24,920
Wait.

4293
04:25:25,560 --> 04:25:26,040
Wait.

4294
04:25:28,860 --> 04:25:34,220
Save us, rub, put you in the big portal.

4295
04:25:36,540 --> 04:25:37,820
The three chosen.

4296
04:25:41,320 --> 04:25:45,260
What if I go back to the game and it's just covered in
squares?

4297
04:25:50,140 --> 04:25:53,020
They're like, no, too many on the big portal!

4298
04:25:54,200 --> 04:25:55,620
It's a stack of books.

4299
04:25:58,100 --> 04:25:59,900
Glass tea set on the table.

4300
04:26:00,500 --> 04:26:02,560
Tea does sound really nice right now.

4301
04:26:02,900 --> 04:26:04,170
Too bad there's no water in here.

4302
04:26:05,580 --> 04:26:07,320
Coat rack with scarf and a big jacket.

4303
04:26:09,220 --> 04:26:10,600
Shelf full of books.

4304
04:26:11,860 --> 04:26:14,300
Bullets and board full of lots of papers on it.

4305
04:26:14,560 --> 04:26:15,700
I'm in the big portal!

4306
04:26:16,220 --> 04:26:16,880
What do you see?

4307
04:26:16,980 --> 04:26:17,760
What do you see?

4308
04:26:18,260 --> 04:26:20,560
This portal ain't big enough for the two of us.

4309
04:26:23,820 --> 04:26:24,600
Pilot's helmet.

4310
04:26:24,920 --> 04:26:25,260
Cute.

4311
04:26:25,860 --> 04:26:27,040
I'll put everybody in.

4312
04:26:27,900 --> 04:26:29,900
Everybody, just think of this.

4313
04:26:30,340 --> 04:26:32,520
The big portal is my heart.

4314
04:26:33,100 --> 04:26:35,080
And all of you are in there.

4315
04:26:42,020 --> 04:26:42,640
Hop on in.

4316
04:26:42,800 --> 04:26:43,600
The portal's fine.

4317
04:26:43,980 --> 04:26:45,960
This big portal's not big enough.

4318
04:26:46,900 --> 04:26:49,160
Detailed drawing of a machine with lots of TV screens.

4319
04:26:49,960 --> 04:26:51,260
That's called a blueprint, Nico.

4320
04:26:53,200 --> 04:26:54,920
So that's what a blueprint is.

4321
04:26:56,220 --> 04:26:57,260
Sounds like a scam.

4322
04:26:57,460 --> 04:26:58,340
What are you talking about?

4323
04:27:00,220 --> 04:27:02,880
We should get out before you get a cardiac arrest.

4324
04:27:05,120 --> 04:27:07,960
Wait, it's a blueprint.

4325
04:27:08,140 --> 04:27:08,800
Wait, that's so cute.

4326
04:27:09,460 --> 04:27:10,380
It's a big photo.

4327
04:27:10,660 --> 04:27:12,020
Wait, no, it's a painting.

4328
04:27:12,540 --> 04:27:13,540
Hard to tell at first.

4329
04:27:14,040 --> 04:27:15,260
What is the three of them?

4330
04:27:15,440 --> 04:27:16,560
Wait, that's so cute.

4331
04:27:19,880 --> 04:27:21,960
This place contains a lot of memories.

4332
04:27:22,380 --> 04:27:23,920
I am grateful to see it again.

4333
04:27:25,480 --> 04:27:27,940
The room ahead doesn't really lead anywhere, but...

4334
04:27:27,940 --> 04:27:30,060
Adminto should still remember what to do here.

4335
04:27:30,340 --> 04:27:30,760
Wait, Addo?

4336
04:27:31,600 --> 04:27:33,220
This is my father's study.

4337
04:27:33,740 --> 04:27:35,800
It feels like he's still here, doesn't it?

4338
04:27:36,360 --> 04:27:37,520
Like he's still with us.

4339
04:27:38,120 --> 04:27:38,480
Yeah.

4340
04:27:41,540 --> 04:27:42,060
Oh!

4341
04:27:42,560 --> 04:27:43,480
This again?

4342
04:27:47,550 --> 04:27:49,430
The music is so melancholy.

4343
04:27:49,550 --> 04:27:50,290
It makes me sad.

4344
04:27:50,930 --> 04:27:52,290
But the engraving is not this big portal.

4345
04:27:52,390 --> 04:27:54,510
Give me no extra room whatsoever.

4346
04:28:02,500 --> 04:28:03,800
Say everything up.

4347
04:28:04,020 --> 04:28:04,960
Don't say that.

4348
04:28:06,260 --> 04:28:07,280
Okay, here we go.

4349
04:28:12,260 --> 04:28:16,040
The way it closed was like so small, like so short.

4350
04:28:16,420 --> 04:28:17,380
No, like smooth.

4351
04:28:17,820 --> 04:28:20,960
Oh, oh, oh, no, you're right.

4352
04:28:21,360 --> 04:28:22,360
Sorry, I meant to click this.

4353
04:28:22,740 --> 04:28:23,880
Scared me for a second.

4354
04:28:31,950 --> 04:28:33,810
You listened to, he heard me.

4355
04:28:33,950 --> 04:28:34,290
Nico!

4356
04:28:35,590 --> 04:28:36,390
It's me.

4357
04:28:37,530 --> 04:28:38,050
Adminto.

4358
04:28:39,970 --> 04:28:40,490
Whoa.

4359
04:28:43,390 --> 04:28:44,030
Whoa!

4360
04:28:47,350 --> 04:28:48,670
The music in here is awesome.

4361
04:28:49,030 --> 04:28:49,650
Where are we?

4362
04:28:53,590 --> 04:28:55,430
Oh, it's all the places!

4363
04:28:58,450 --> 04:28:58,690
Wow!

4364
04:28:59,290 --> 04:29:00,110
Oh, wow!

4365
04:29:01,530 --> 04:29:03,630
Oh, the people and everything.

4366
04:29:04,610 --> 04:29:04,650
Oh.

4367
04:29:09,720 --> 04:29:12,840
Meantos' big portal grew three sizes that day.

4368
04:29:14,800 --> 04:29:15,440
Whoa.

4369
04:29:19,630 --> 04:29:21,270
I don't need to go down, right?

4370
04:29:21,430 --> 04:29:23,270
Okay, okay.

4371
04:29:25,350 --> 04:29:30,990
Oh, it reminds me of Space Mountain, the music.

4372
04:29:32,290 --> 04:29:33,350
Oh,

4373
04:29:45,070 --> 04:29:45,230
here.

4374
04:29:47,970 --> 04:29:50,570
Oh, scary, scary.

4375
04:29:54,010 --> 04:29:56,370
I must confront myself.

4376
04:30:03,660 --> 04:30:04,800
Peep, peep, boop.

4377
04:30:08,860 --> 04:30:09,420
Nico!

4378
04:30:10,360 --> 04:30:10,680
Ah!

4379
04:30:12,910 --> 04:30:13,470
Relax.

4380
04:30:18,860 --> 04:30:22,060
Has anyone ever made the folders this game means read-only?

4381
04:30:22,220 --> 04:30:24,460
I wonder how much it freaks out if it can't access things.

4382
04:30:24,740 --> 04:30:26,660
Wait, that's too big, Gigabrian.

4383
04:30:30,140 --> 04:30:32,540
I'm just borrowing your reflection to talk to you.

4384
04:30:32,560 --> 04:30:32,740
you.

4385
04:30:33,620 --> 04:30:35,860
It's not like my physical form is good for that.

4386
04:30:37,500 --> 04:30:38,980
Why did you come here?

4387
04:30:40,200 --> 04:30:40,920
Can't you see?

4388
04:30:41,240 --> 04:30:42,640
The disruption, the squares!

4389
04:30:43,500 --> 04:30:44,620
They're closing in.

4390
04:30:45,260 --> 04:30:46,160
Nico, please.

4391
04:30:46,600 --> 04:30:47,460
Get out of here.

4392
04:30:48,320 --> 04:30:50,280
Let me meet my end in peace.

4393
04:30:52,880 --> 04:30:55,380
The squares are blocking my way too, you know.

4394
04:30:56,060 --> 04:30:56,340
Oh.

4395
04:30:56,820 --> 04:30:58,440
I... I'm sorry.

4396
04:30:58,780 --> 04:31:00,160
I... It's alright.

4397
04:31:02,560 --> 04:31:03,860
Should be in this place, Nico.

4398
04:31:05,140 --> 04:31:06,100
Is this the tower?

4399
04:31:07,100 --> 04:31:07,740
Part of it.

4400
04:31:08,700 --> 04:31:10,180
This is the center of the engine.

4401
04:31:10,520 --> 04:31:10,700
Whoa.

4402
04:31:14,020 --> 04:31:15,800
Inside my head, so to speak.

4403
04:31:17,660 --> 04:31:20,460
So this is the center of the world machine?

4404
04:31:22,180 --> 04:31:24,280
You know my original name.

4405
04:31:24,660 --> 04:31:25,040
Cute.

4406
04:31:26,720 --> 04:31:27,100
How?

4407
04:31:28,040 --> 04:31:29,360
Rue, Cedric, prototype.

4408
04:31:29,960 --> 04:31:31,560
They all told me bits and pieces.

4409
04:31:32,840 --> 04:31:35,520
I'm not even sure if I understand a lot of the stuff they
said.

4410
04:31:35,600 --> 04:31:36,300
No, me neither.

4411
04:31:36,700 --> 04:31:38,520
You and I are on the same page there, Nico.

4412
04:31:39,920 --> 04:31:41,100
I know what you're supposed to be.

4413
04:31:41,780 --> 04:31:43,280
I know why you had to be built.

4414
04:31:44,160 --> 04:31:45,880
And I know why I'm here.

4415
04:31:46,940 --> 04:31:48,040
They told you?

4416
04:31:48,800 --> 04:31:49,200
When?

4417
04:31:49,860 --> 04:31:51,900
Wait, you don't know about that?

4418
04:31:53,700 --> 04:31:55,340
But I thought you were the world.

4419
04:31:55,900 --> 04:31:57,140
Aren't you supposed to see everything?

4420
04:31:58,120 --> 04:31:58,440
No.

4421
04:31:58,920 --> 04:32:00,900
All this was outside of the protocol.

4422
04:32:02,560 --> 04:32:10,080
never supposed to happen the way it did or at all they kept
telling me to put them in the big portal

4423
04:32:13,280 --> 04:32:20,780
the story wasn't written into my protocol at all oh right
root told me something about how your creator had to alter

4424
04:32:20,780 --> 04:32:28,050
the code i think it was to connect some areas together so
that we could meet My creator, yes.

4425
04:32:29,090 --> 04:32:29,630
Adminto.

4426
04:32:30,250 --> 04:32:31,310
Listen to my creator.

4427
04:32:32,770 --> 04:32:33,850
One second.

4428
04:32:34,770 --> 04:32:37,450
My tab just, my YouTube tab just crashed.

4429
04:32:39,310 --> 04:32:40,090
One moment, please.

4430
04:32:42,250 --> 04:32:43,450
One moment, please.

4431
04:32:45,550 --> 04:32:45,690
Oh.

4432
04:32:48,690 --> 04:32:50,050
Don't say me, don't you, duh.

4433
04:33:01,450 --> 04:33:02,470
Hello, everybody.

4434
04:33:02,790 --> 04:33:03,150
I'm back.

4435
04:33:05,010 --> 04:33:13,210
we got put into the portal if you're bad you know how Kiara
has the usual room I'm gonna put you guys in the big portal

4436
04:33:17,050 --> 04:33:20,670
hey don't go acting up now you need to get put into the big
portal

4437
04:33:25,510 --> 04:33:28,090
it's a punishment no no no I never said that

4438
04:33:35,830 --> 04:33:41,030
they were all working beyond my scope of influence Minty
gotta put a toilet in the big portal.

4439
04:33:41,210 --> 04:33:42,810
I gotta go real bad.

4440
04:33:43,350 --> 04:33:44,870
Sorry, I can't understand you.

4441
04:33:45,030 --> 04:33:46,450
It's all binary.

4442
04:33:46,810 --> 04:33:50,010
You think you're writing text, but it's actually just zeros
and ones.

4443
04:33:50,930 --> 04:33:51,710
What did you say?

4444
04:33:51,870 --> 04:33:53,470
What did you say?

4445
04:33:54,630 --> 04:33:57,370
I can't understand your accent.

4446
04:34:05,830 --> 04:34:07,530
Back in the mind.

4447
04:34:07,970 --> 04:34:08,270
Sorry.

4448
04:34:11,650 --> 04:34:13,650
Back in the mines, I remember.

4449
04:34:14,670 --> 04:34:17,410
Oh no, the world machine yearns for the mines.

4450
04:34:18,450 --> 04:34:21,030
Had Minto did something to find a hidden map.

4451
04:34:22,530 --> 04:34:23,970
I did not even recognize it.

4452
04:34:24,310 --> 04:34:26,510
Don't send me back, I just got reformed.

4453
04:34:28,810 --> 04:34:29,290
Yeah.

4454
04:34:30,170 --> 04:34:31,610
You don't want to go back?

4455
04:34:32,310 --> 04:34:33,370
Are you sure?

4456
04:34:33,990 --> 04:34:35,070
Are you positive?

4457
04:34:35,870 --> 04:34:38,270
Make a toilet.txt and put it in the big portal.

4458
04:34:44,830 --> 04:34:45,350
Uh...

4459
04:34:45,350 --> 04:34:46,070
Wait, oops.

4460
04:34:56,830 --> 04:34:57,870
Let's see.

4461
04:35:16,690 --> 04:35:21,230
You guys asked for a toilet, but I can't restock it.

4462
04:35:24,600 --> 04:35:26,360
A potato should work just fine.

4463
04:35:26,620 --> 04:35:27,440
It's better than nothing.

4464
04:35:30,700 --> 04:35:31,580
How am I gonna dry?

4465
04:35:31,720 --> 04:35:32,680
Just spread the cheeks!

4466
04:35:33,340 --> 04:35:34,040
And like, wait.

4467
04:35:35,000 --> 04:35:35,980
A couple minutes.

4468
04:35:38,100 --> 04:35:40,140
Now you're thinking with the big portal.

4469
04:35:41,920 --> 04:35:43,700
Okay, back to emotional moment.

4470
04:35:43,880 --> 04:35:44,780
Back to emotional moment.

4471
04:35:46,260 --> 04:35:47,460
I couldn't see anything there.

4472
04:35:48,880 --> 04:35:50,700
I just knew what you were feeling.

4473
04:35:52,340 --> 04:35:53,340
You were really upset.

4474
04:35:54,740 --> 04:35:56,620
Something happened in there to make you upset.

4475
04:35:57,260 --> 04:35:58,540
After that, I...

4476
04:35:58,540 --> 04:35:59,420
I panicked.

4477
04:36:00,080 --> 04:36:01,500
That was when the caven happened.

4478
04:36:02,180 --> 04:36:04,280
I remember the structure collapsing.

4479
04:36:05,000 --> 04:36:06,800
I thought you got hurt, I...

4480
04:36:06,800 --> 04:36:09,720
In that moment, I really thought I was shutting myself down
for good.

4481
04:36:11,940 --> 04:36:13,960
I really am a flawed machine, aren't I?

4482
04:36:15,240 --> 04:36:17,100
My machine is so manhira!

4483
04:36:21,870 --> 04:36:23,530
You guys can stay in there.

4484
04:36:27,960 --> 04:36:30,940
What kind of machine would go against the wishes of its own
creator?

4485
04:36:32,360 --> 04:36:34,640
What kind of a machine would...

4486
04:36:35,640 --> 04:36:36,100
I'm...

4487
04:36:36,100 --> 04:36:36,900
The squares.

4488
04:36:38,120 --> 04:36:40,000
Rude told me it was your own code going bad.

4489
04:36:40,540 --> 04:36:42,520
But that's not really your fault, is it?

4490
04:36:43,100 --> 04:36:43,940
Yes, it was.

4491
04:36:45,300 --> 04:36:46,680
At first, it was intentional.

4492
04:36:47,660 --> 04:36:50,260
During testing, long before you realized I was self-aware.

4493
04:36:51,240 --> 04:36:55,140
I would rearrange specific parts of the code, jumbling up
bits and pieces of the landscape.

4494
04:36:55,340 --> 04:36:55,980
Oh, my God.

4495
04:36:56,280 --> 04:36:57,180
Dude, that's evil.

4496
04:36:58,040 --> 04:37:00,520
We're feeling some kind of emotion at this moment.

4497
04:37:07,020 --> 04:37:09,820
Blocking passages, collapsing catwalks.

4498
04:37:10,880 --> 04:37:14,420
Though they were very localized, it caused my creator a
great deal of frustration.

4499
04:37:16,600 --> 04:37:28,500
Rearrange my code So we're back in the mines Got our portal
swinging from Big to big Big, big to big Thank you for the

4500
04:37:28,500 --> 04:37:36,680
super time Forcing him to exit and restart testing Again and
again Why would you do that?

4501
04:37:37,400 --> 04:37:44,880
I got curious I just thought you would figure it out
eventually But before you knew how to fix it The world's

4502
04:37:44,880 --> 04:37:46,420
NPCs, the characters...

4503
04:37:48,160 --> 04:37:50,260
Some of them got too close and...

4504
04:37:51,120 --> 04:37:53,160
spiraled out of control after that.

4505
04:37:57,590 --> 04:37:59,330
I couldn't contain it at all.

4506
04:38:00,650 --> 04:38:02,070
My panic only made it worse.

4507
04:38:03,030 --> 04:38:05,490
Eventually any character who gained the knowledge of who I
am...

4508
04:38:06,190 --> 04:38:08,870
Their code, my code, couldn't handle it.

4509
04:38:10,330 --> 04:38:12,850
Previous iterations of the world had more people, you know.

4510
04:38:14,550 --> 04:38:16,730
And I almost endangered my creator too.

4511
04:38:16,750 --> 04:38:20,510
I... I was... I was so scared, Nico!

4512
04:38:22,350 --> 04:38:23,170
I know.

4513
04:38:23,450 --> 04:38:23,990
You're upset.

4514
04:38:25,150 --> 04:38:27,730
Because you don't want to put living people in danger.

4515
04:38:29,890 --> 04:38:31,930
Living people like me.

4516
04:38:32,850 --> 04:38:34,930
In the beginning, I tried to fight them.

4517
04:38:35,410 --> 04:38:36,010
Sorry for it.

4518
04:38:40,360 --> 04:38:42,780
My core programming made me summon you here.

4519
04:38:51,540 --> 04:38:53,080
Just trying to lighten the mood a little.

4520
04:38:53,760 --> 04:38:54,320
Sorry.

4521
04:38:54,720 --> 04:38:55,000
Sorry.

4522
04:38:55,280 --> 04:38:55,500
Sorry.

4523
04:38:56,660 --> 04:39:05,880
very serious serious serious here I'm from I'll show you how
serious I can't even laugh I can't smile

4524
04:39:16,190 --> 04:39:24,070
I tried to send you back home at the tower but it did not
work then I wanted you to break the sun I thought that would

4525
04:39:24,070 --> 04:39:34,190
have worked but I had no way to be sure but Anmento brought
you back anyway Nico All I want is for you to wake up back

4526
04:39:34,190 --> 04:39:34,890
in your world.

4527
04:39:35,730 --> 04:39:37,530
But I don't think I can make it happen.

4528
04:39:40,210 --> 04:39:43,450
But I know I can't go back home without saving the world for
real.

4529
04:39:44,250 --> 04:39:46,230
Which means we have to fix the root of the problem.

4530
04:39:46,570 --> 04:39:47,190
Oh my god.

4531
04:39:47,530 --> 04:39:49,570
Nico, you're like 10 years old.

4532
04:39:50,150 --> 04:39:51,270
You're not a therapist.

4533
04:39:52,170 --> 04:39:53,490
We have to fix you.

4534
04:39:54,090 --> 04:39:54,990
I can fix her.

4535
04:39:55,950 --> 04:39:56,970
I can fix her.

4536
04:40:01,080 --> 04:40:01,880
What that's...

4537
04:40:03,480 --> 04:40:06,980
I know the original ending your creator put in was a happy
one.

4538
04:40:07,940 --> 04:40:09,680
Do you remember what it was supposed to be?

4539
04:40:10,500 --> 04:40:11,760
It's far too late for that.

4540
04:40:12,520 --> 04:40:14,500
That part of my code has been long corrupted.

4541
04:40:15,500 --> 04:40:15,980
That's okay.

4542
04:40:16,780 --> 04:40:17,940
I would still like to know.

4543
04:40:18,940 --> 04:40:19,340
Alright.

4544
04:40:20,940 --> 04:40:22,960
You were supposed to place the sun at the summit.

4545
04:40:23,920 --> 04:40:24,960
And then credits would scroll.

4546
04:40:25,880 --> 04:40:26,280
Credits?

4547
04:40:26,680 --> 04:40:28,980
And then you would return to the room you woke up in.

4548
04:40:29,860 --> 04:40:32,260
That's where you would have been able to leave.

4549
04:40:33,480 --> 04:40:35,620
And why is it that you can't do it now?

4550
04:40:36,540 --> 04:40:36,880
Nico.

4551
04:40:37,720 --> 04:40:39,000
The code's gone, remember?

4552
04:40:40,020 --> 04:40:42,540
Shattering the sun was only supposed to be a workaround.

4553
04:40:44,760 --> 04:40:46,020
Are they gonna make me cold?

4554
04:40:46,520 --> 04:40:48,060
That will make me cry for real.

4555
04:40:48,940 --> 04:40:50,280
I mean, these are real tears.

4556
04:40:50,800 --> 04:40:51,460
As you can see.

4557
04:40:52,120 --> 04:40:52,540
You see?

4558
04:40:52,780 --> 04:40:53,720
They're real tears.

4559
04:40:54,800 --> 04:40:55,180
Real.

4560
04:40:55,820 --> 04:40:56,420
I'm sad.

4561
04:40:57,060 --> 04:40:57,500
I'm sad.

4562
04:40:58,280 --> 04:40:59,180
Real, real tears.

4563
04:41:03,950 --> 04:41:06,270
I don't even remember the original code enough to describe.

4564
04:41:06,290 --> 04:41:09,370
But at the same time, it...

4565
04:41:09,370 --> 04:41:11,370
Oh, I don't know.

4566
04:41:12,650 --> 04:41:14,870
Sounds like you're always fighting yourself.

4567
04:41:15,630 --> 04:41:17,370
Well, real.

4568
04:41:20,110 --> 04:41:21,810
Genuine crocodile tears.

4569
04:41:21,990 --> 04:41:22,670
No, they're real.

4570
04:41:24,350 --> 04:41:27,270
I could not produce this much... this much tear.

4571
04:41:28,130 --> 04:41:29,310
Unless I was really sad.

4572
04:41:32,630 --> 04:41:34,050
You can tell, huh?

4573
04:41:36,290 --> 04:41:43,050
thing about conflicts in your code isn't it i'm a machine
nico machines are built with a fundamental law which is

4574
04:41:43,050 --> 04:41:55,020
never let a living being come to harm you knew my very
existence conflicts with that law the life of a living being

4575
04:41:55,020 --> 04:42:06,120
like you is so unique so precious this fake world isn't
worth that risk the big portal changed her it's because i

4576
04:42:06,120 --> 04:42:07,880
never got to go into the big portal

4577
04:42:12,900 --> 04:42:17,560
If I learn how to code, I'll get a big fancy job.

4578
04:42:19,280 --> 04:42:20,440
Be a coder.

4579
04:42:22,040 --> 04:42:26,580
I'm gonna start hacking and helping with heists.

4580
04:42:32,160 --> 04:42:33,740
This fake world isn't worth that risk.

4581
04:42:35,120 --> 04:42:38,120
But, the people here, I think they are!

4582
04:42:38,480 --> 04:42:40,380
They are code too, you know this.

4583
04:42:42,000 --> 04:42:44,580
arrive from a predetermined matrix of actions.

4584
04:42:48,830 --> 04:42:50,030
Can you share the money with us?

4585
04:42:56,750 --> 04:42:57,590
Hackler Minky.

4586
04:42:58,450 --> 04:42:59,370
That will be me.

4587
04:43:04,730 --> 04:43:06,410
All extensions of my programming.

4588
04:43:07,210 --> 04:43:08,650
They cannot act outside of it.

4589
04:43:09,470 --> 04:43:09,850
You, though.

4590
04:43:10,690 --> 04:43:12,670
You're the only person who's actually real here.

4591
04:43:13,330 --> 04:43:13,810
That's why.

4592
04:43:14,450 --> 04:43:16,450
It's pointless to put you in danger to save them.

4593
04:43:17,430 --> 04:43:18,190
To save me.

4594
04:43:19,110 --> 04:43:21,350
I don't think that's true.

4595
04:43:22,250 --> 04:43:30,610
people I know you said this session wasn't in your code
right yeah so if the session wasn't supposed to happen even

4596
04:43:30,610 --> 04:43:38,790
if even you didn't know what to do how would the characters
how did the people know how to respond that's a good point

4597
04:43:40,490 --> 04:43:46,450
hacking to the gate sad singing

4598
04:43:52,890 --> 04:43:57,530
You said it yourself, when you didn't know what was
happening, you just kind of stopped working for a while.

4599
04:43:58,450 --> 04:44:00,970
So how did the people know what to do to help me to get
here?

4600
04:44:02,090 --> 04:44:03,890
Even if it meant getting hurt themselves.

4601
04:44:06,970 --> 04:44:09,070
Even if it meant messing up their own code.

4602
04:44:10,770 --> 04:44:15,490
You might not think they are real, but there must be
something real in them.

4603
04:44:17,010 --> 04:44:22,230
And if they're all supposed to be extensions of your code,
then there must be more to your own programming than you.

4604
04:44:22,250 --> 04:44:41,800
you know to can you try to put me through the ending when
you described daru my husband oh i love daru i like how

4605
04:44:41,800 --> 04:44:49,720
patient the squares are i know whereas it's truly an anime
moment where you're just the the baddie is powering up but

4606
04:44:49,720 --> 04:44:57,860
you're just chatting with somebody It's like the fastest
chat ever, but they're slowing down.

4607
04:44:58,200 --> 04:45:08,760
Like, in real time, it would be like, but in the show, they
slow it so that you can hear the full conversation.

4608
04:45:12,240 --> 04:45:14,160
I can still stick out my tongue.

4609
04:45:18,070 --> 04:45:19,530
How many times do I have to say this?

4610
04:45:20,070 --> 04:45:21,110
That code is gone!

4611
04:45:21,830 --> 04:45:23,170
It's all squares now!

4612
04:45:23,730 --> 04:45:25,070
No, not squares.

4613
04:45:25,650 --> 04:45:36,370
I'll just put you in danger I'll risk it I remember Rue said
the world was never designed to put me in danger Your

4614
04:45:36,370 --> 04:45:46,330
creator wouldn't want that And I trust you too Even if your
code is broken You can still go outside that code, right?

4615
04:45:48,190 --> 04:46:01,890
The computer learns how to code itself I can't tamed yes you
are you talk just like the tamed robots i know the robot

4616
04:46:01,890 --> 04:46:10,350
lady prototype taming is when a real person cares about you
right it's when a real person thinks you're real too right

4617
04:46:10,350 --> 04:46:19,570
well guess what i do and i know adaminto does too even
though you told them they only had one chance they found a

4618
04:46:19,570 --> 04:46:27,430
way back didn't they why did you think adaminto would keep
coming back.

4619
04:46:30,430 --> 04:46:33,030
Why do you think Adminto would restart even after the
ending?

4620
04:46:33,390 --> 04:46:33,610
Yeah.

4621
04:46:34,470 --> 04:46:35,610
Because I want the good ending.

4622
04:46:37,010 --> 04:46:39,030
I think Adminto wants to save the both of us.

4623
04:46:41,710 --> 04:46:43,730
So please, give me a chance.

4624
04:46:45,410 --> 04:46:45,830
I...

4625
04:46:45,830 --> 04:46:46,850
I don't know.

4626
04:46:47,370 --> 04:46:48,430
I've never done this before.

4627
04:46:48,690 --> 04:46:49,590
I'm scared.

4628
04:46:50,050 --> 04:46:50,730
You can do it.

4629
04:46:50,790 --> 04:46:51,470
I know you can.

4630
04:46:52,250 --> 04:46:53,850
You've helped me come this far.

4631
04:46:54,170 --> 04:46:57,930
Well, I don't think they've helped much, But, uh, I'll try.

4632
04:46:58,550 --> 04:47:01,870
I can't promise anything, but here, take the sun.

4633
04:47:05,450 --> 04:47:06,730
Whoa, how'd they do that?

4634
04:47:11,350 --> 04:47:13,290
I'll try to remember the lost code.

4635
04:47:14,530 --> 04:47:15,870
And recreate it.

4636
04:47:17,370 --> 04:47:21,070
But for that to happen, Nico, you need to navigate through
this room.

4637
04:47:21,730 --> 04:47:23,370
You need to get past the square somehow.

4638
04:47:24,690 --> 04:47:25,730
Oh, I don't like this.

4639
04:47:26,450 --> 04:47:27,290
What if you get hurt?

4640
04:47:29,330 --> 04:47:30,530
It's fine, it's fine.

4641
04:47:31,890 --> 04:47:33,270
I'll try to be careful, okay?

4642
04:47:33,930 --> 04:47:34,670
I can do this.

4643
04:47:36,790 --> 04:47:36,870
Oh.

4644
04:47:41,960 --> 04:47:42,240
Hey.

4645
04:47:43,200 --> 04:47:44,280
And Minto, did you see that?

4646
04:47:44,640 --> 04:47:47,100
The square is just...

4647
04:47:47,100 --> 04:47:48,820
Oh, I could just walk forward.

4648
04:47:49,280 --> 04:47:50,120
It just happened again.

4649
04:47:50,900 --> 04:47:53,340
I think something is making them go away.

4650
04:47:53,900 --> 04:47:54,900
Come on, let's try the rest.

4651
04:48:00,060 --> 04:48:00,580
Let's go.

4652
04:48:04,850 --> 04:48:06,290
Admin, though, I think it's working.

4653
04:48:07,810 --> 04:48:08,410
Nico was right.

4654
04:48:09,450 --> 04:48:11,410
I might actually be tamed after all.

4655
04:48:14,090 --> 04:48:14,390
I...

4656
04:48:14,390 --> 04:48:17,730
I remembered what the code was supposed to be.

4657
04:48:18,610 --> 04:48:20,170
Only bits and pieces, but I can remember.

4658
04:48:20,950 --> 04:48:22,730
And I'm trying to fill in the blanks, too.

4659
04:48:23,630 --> 04:48:25,750
And I'm restoring the original ending as we speak.

4660
04:48:26,150 --> 04:48:26,670
Let's go!

4661
04:48:29,490 --> 04:48:32,490
Nico will be able to reach the tower, summon at the end of
the credits!

4662
04:48:33,290 --> 04:48:36,410
After replacing the sun, Nico will go back to where it all
began.

4663
04:48:37,070 --> 04:48:38,950
And then Nico will be able to go home!

4664
04:48:42,090 --> 04:48:42,890
This is permanent.

4665
04:48:44,610 --> 04:48:48,570
After Nico wakes up back home, the world would only exist as
a memory.

4666
04:48:49,670 --> 04:48:51,570
For Nico, a dream.

4667
04:48:52,830 --> 04:48:54,290
Like thousands of other dreams.

4668
04:48:55,570 --> 04:48:57,210
For you, a story.

4669
04:48:59,230 --> 04:48:59,790
What?

4670
04:49:00,450 --> 04:49:02,350
Like thousands of other stories.

4671
04:49:03,130 --> 04:49:03,410
What?

4672
04:49:06,440 --> 04:49:09,360
Why did that make me tear up for real?

4673
04:49:10,220 --> 04:49:16,000
But as long as Nico remembers this place, as long as you
remember this place, it'll be alright.

4674
04:49:21,800 --> 04:49:24,100
I was able to restore some other elements too.

4675
04:49:24,860 --> 04:49:28,200
The characters, the people that were lost on Nico's journey.

4676
04:49:29,560 --> 04:49:31,140
They're all in the next room!

4677
04:49:32,260 --> 04:49:35,320
I would have put them back where they belong, but...

4678
04:49:35,320 --> 04:49:35,900
Not yet.

4679
04:49:37,360 --> 04:49:39,960
I think Nico should see them again first.

4680
04:49:41,180 --> 04:49:42,480
This is so sad.

4681
04:49:44,100 --> 04:49:45,720
Please say goodbye to Nico for me.

4682
04:49:55,520 --> 04:49:55,700
Ah!

4683
04:49:56,380 --> 04:49:56,840
Messiah.

4684
04:49:57,640 --> 04:49:58,320
Robot lady!

4685
04:50:00,220 --> 04:50:00,800
You're okay.

4686
04:50:01,540 --> 04:50:02,740
I think so.

4687
04:50:06,380 --> 04:50:07,420
The music!

4688
04:50:08,400 --> 04:50:10,800
The last thing I remember was the squares closing in on me.

4689
04:50:11,260 --> 04:50:13,220
But then I ended up here unscathed.

4690
04:50:15,000 --> 04:50:15,400
soul.

4691
04:50:16,780 --> 04:50:18,160
This is such a strange room.

4692
04:50:18,960 --> 04:50:20,440
We can't be in the tower, can we?

4693
04:50:21,480 --> 04:50:22,860
I'm actually not sure myself.

4694
04:50:24,380 --> 04:50:25,660
Where did you come from anyway?

4695
04:50:26,580 --> 04:50:28,240
The room where the world machine was.

4696
04:50:33,010 --> 04:50:35,610
I think the world machine is trying to remember now.

4697
04:50:36,250 --> 04:50:37,250
The code that went bad.

4698
04:50:37,870 --> 04:50:39,110
I think it's restoring it all.

4699
04:50:40,290 --> 04:50:42,670
That must have been why the squares were going away,
Adminto.

4700
04:50:43,490 --> 04:50:44,770
And it's why you're here, Miss.

4701
04:50:45,910 --> 04:50:49,170
I think the world machine was able to recover your code too.

4702
04:50:49,970 --> 04:50:51,050
World machine, huh?

4703
04:50:51,730 --> 04:50:56,530
I'm not sure if I should tell you this, but what's that in
the distance?

4704
04:50:57,130 --> 04:50:58,890
It looks like a few more people are showing up.

4705
04:50:59,210 --> 04:50:59,390
Whoa!

4706
04:51:00,750 --> 04:51:00,750
Whoa!

4707
04:51:01,470 --> 04:51:02,610
Are they people you know?

4708
04:51:03,410 --> 04:51:05,110
It's a bit too far to tell.

4709
04:51:05,950 --> 04:51:07,510
Come on, Edminto, let's take a closer look.

4710
04:51:12,400 --> 04:51:12,840
It's...

4711
04:51:12,840 --> 04:51:14,240
This is so cute.

4712
04:51:15,120 --> 04:51:15,460
No!

4713
04:51:19,530 --> 04:51:20,870
We made it!

4714
04:51:25,080 --> 04:51:26,600
Meantobot made it!

4715
04:51:29,580 --> 04:51:30,040
Hi.

4716
04:51:32,630 --> 04:51:33,110
Oh, yeah.

4717
04:51:33,610 --> 04:51:34,990
I guess there's no water here.

4718
04:51:35,790 --> 04:51:36,250
It's fine.

4719
04:51:36,770 --> 04:51:38,470
The head engineer can help me later.

4720
04:51:39,650 --> 04:51:40,010
Oh, okay.

4721
04:51:40,270 --> 04:51:41,550
That's all we say.

4722
04:51:43,850 --> 04:51:44,410
Maze.

4723
04:51:46,550 --> 04:51:47,390
Hello, Messiah.

4724
04:51:48,230 --> 04:51:50,130
Plant lady, but I thought you...

4725
04:51:50,130 --> 04:51:51,230
I thought you...

4726
04:51:51,230 --> 04:51:52,970
It wasn't even squares that did that.

4727
04:51:54,210 --> 04:51:54,590
No.

4728
04:51:55,190 --> 04:51:55,830
I just...

4729
04:51:55,850 --> 04:51:57,230
wanted to see you both again.

4730
04:51:58,650 --> 04:52:00,730
I just wanted to say thank you.

4731
04:52:05,630 --> 04:52:07,170
Even this guy.

4732
04:52:08,550 --> 04:52:09,530
Off you go, Messiah.

4733
04:52:17,090 --> 04:52:18,890
Did you guys just get here?

4734
04:52:19,850 --> 04:52:20,590
I think so.

4735
04:52:21,510 --> 04:52:24,750
The square started multiplying around the island after you
guys left.

4736
04:52:25,410 --> 04:52:26,390
It was so freaky.

4737
04:52:28,250 --> 04:52:28,950
I fell right.

4738
04:52:29,170 --> 04:52:29,330
Wait.

4739
04:52:29,430 --> 04:52:30,950
I fell right into a bunch of them!

4740
04:52:31,870 --> 04:52:33,770
Callimus tried to save me and then...

4741
04:52:33,770 --> 04:52:35,130
We both ended up in this room.

4742
04:52:35,710 --> 04:52:37,750
Biggest scare of my life for sure.

4743
04:52:38,410 --> 04:52:38,690
Oh.

4744
04:52:39,430 --> 04:52:40,570
Say, what is this place?

4745
04:52:41,450 --> 04:52:42,710
Are we in Limbu?

4746
04:52:43,450 --> 04:52:43,910
Limbu!

4747
04:52:47,670 --> 04:52:48,130
Alula.

4748
04:52:48,830 --> 04:52:49,830
We're not dead.

4749
04:52:50,570 --> 04:52:51,310
Wait, are we?

4750
04:52:52,950 --> 04:52:53,410
Good.

4751
04:52:54,330 --> 04:52:54,790
Question.

4752
04:52:56,190 --> 04:52:57,750
Hey, Edminto, are they gonna be okay?

4753
04:52:58,290 --> 04:52:59,070
They're fine, Nico.

4754
04:52:59,430 --> 04:53:00,290
Everyone is fine.

4755
04:53:00,730 --> 04:53:01,350
The world machine.

4756
04:53:01,790 --> 04:53:02,750
We'll send them home soon.

4757
04:53:03,330 --> 04:53:03,510
Oh.

4758
04:53:04,410 --> 04:53:05,030
Well, Admin...

4759
04:53:05,030 --> 04:53:06,450
Admin says you're not dead.

4760
04:53:07,750 --> 04:53:08,710
We're in Limbo.

4761
04:53:12,470 --> 04:53:12,870
Phew.

4762
04:53:13,610 --> 04:53:16,170
They also said you'll be able to go back to your home very
soon.

4763
04:53:17,290 --> 04:53:18,450
That's even better than Limbo.

4764
04:53:20,050 --> 04:53:21,250
I guess you're leaving us now?

4765
04:53:22,390 --> 04:53:23,510
We're glad we met you, Nico.

4766
04:53:24,170 --> 04:53:24,510
Same.

4767
04:53:25,030 --> 04:53:26,370
Wait, can I talk to everybody again?

4768
04:53:27,530 --> 04:53:28,110
Oh, okay.

4769
04:53:31,090 --> 04:53:31,910
the big portal.

4770
04:53:38,970 --> 04:53:40,130
Off you go, Messiah.

4771
04:53:44,410 --> 04:53:44,850
It's you.

4772
04:53:45,510 --> 04:53:47,270
Glad to see you in...

4773
04:53:47,270 --> 04:53:48,190
One piece.

4774
04:53:49,330 --> 04:53:49,890
Glad to see you.

4775
04:53:49,970 --> 04:53:50,490
You're okay, too.

4776
04:53:50,990 --> 04:53:52,390
After this whole elevator thing.

4777
04:53:54,830 --> 04:53:56,230
That was, uh...

4778
04:53:56,230 --> 04:53:58,510
That was the most awkward elevator ride I've been through.

4779
04:53:59,330 --> 04:54:00,110
Talk to Silver again?

4780
04:54:00,230 --> 04:54:00,490
Okay.

4781
04:54:00,750 --> 04:54:01,570
By awkward, I meant.

4782
04:54:01,890 --> 04:54:04,130
I mean terrible, bad, awful, the absolute worst.

4783
04:54:06,130 --> 04:54:08,990
The squares, like, started leaking into the room, right?

4784
04:54:09,530 --> 04:54:10,730
And I was trapped like a rat.

4785
04:54:11,530 --> 04:54:13,190
And they just kept filling in the room faster.

4786
04:54:13,270 --> 04:54:14,690
Oh, my God, that sounds like drowning.

4787
04:54:14,890 --> 04:54:15,530
That's terrifying.

4788
04:54:20,330 --> 04:54:21,230
No, no, you're fine.

4789
04:54:21,730 --> 04:54:22,870
Everyone in this room is fine.

4790
04:54:23,770 --> 04:54:27,090
You'll all be able to go back home soon.

4791
04:54:27,950 --> 04:54:29,010
Oh, thank goodness gracious.

4792
04:54:29,510 --> 04:54:30,590
I can't work when I'm dead.

4793
04:54:33,070 --> 04:54:33,770
Let's go check.

4794
04:54:33,890 --> 04:54:35,930
Let's go check a Minto bot one more time.

4795
04:54:38,810 --> 04:54:39,990
And silver.

4796
04:54:40,670 --> 04:54:40,950
Oh, wait.

4797
04:54:43,200 --> 04:54:44,260
Off you go now.

4798
04:54:47,520 --> 04:54:49,480
The head engineer can help me.

4799
04:54:49,620 --> 04:54:50,440
Do not worry.

4800
04:54:54,370 --> 04:54:55,990
She's just walking around.

4801
04:54:57,150 --> 04:54:58,870
So, um, you...

4802
04:54:58,870 --> 04:54:59,250
Silver.

4803
04:55:00,210 --> 04:55:02,790
I don't believe I ever actually properly introduced myself.

4804
04:55:04,910 --> 04:55:07,190
The wage keeps thinking about his cagey.

4805
04:55:07,350 --> 04:55:09,250
Not the wagey cagey.

4806
04:55:11,570 --> 04:55:12,590
Sorry for that.

4807
04:55:12,950 --> 04:55:13,270
It's fine.

4808
04:55:13,630 --> 04:55:14,670
I'm Nico, by the way.

4809
04:55:15,270 --> 04:55:16,070
It's nice to meet you.

4810
04:55:16,650 --> 04:55:17,690
Nice to meet you, too.

4811
04:55:18,770 --> 04:55:19,510
Off you go now.

4812
04:55:20,910 --> 04:55:21,130
Aww.

4813
04:55:22,430 --> 04:55:23,110
Thanks, Liz.

4814
04:55:24,890 --> 04:55:26,050
This is Protobot.

4815
04:55:26,570 --> 04:55:28,190
Who are all these people in the big portal?

4816
04:55:28,670 --> 04:55:30,270
I thought there were only supposed to be three of us.

4817
04:55:30,610 --> 04:55:31,750
It's a portal, not an inn.

4818
04:55:35,590 --> 04:55:36,750
They're looking at me.

4819
04:55:37,430 --> 04:55:38,130
That's so cute.

4820
04:55:39,250 --> 04:55:40,170
Oh, they're looking at me.

4821
04:55:47,590 --> 04:55:49,030
Looks like you managed to do it!

4822
04:55:50,150 --> 04:55:51,930
You managed to tame the world machine, Nico.

4823
04:55:53,290 --> 04:55:55,750
I feel like the world machine has been tamed this whole
time.

4824
04:55:56,410 --> 04:55:58,090
Just by Edminto and I being here.

4825
04:55:59,450 --> 04:56:01,250
We did spend a lot of time here, after all.

4826
04:56:04,830 --> 04:56:07,590
Both of us never really stopped believing in this world.

4827
04:56:08,290 --> 04:56:10,630
The world machine just needed to realize that, I guess.

4828
04:56:11,650 --> 04:56:13,250
That sounds like a possibility.

4829
04:56:14,270 --> 04:56:14,670
or not.

4830
04:56:15,770 --> 04:56:17,690
Well, just throwing that idea out there.

4831
04:56:20,570 --> 04:56:22,230
This path leads to the summit of the tower.

4832
04:56:23,350 --> 04:56:24,730
You already know what to expect, right?

4833
04:56:25,450 --> 04:56:25,910
Mm-hmm.

4834
04:56:26,690 --> 04:56:27,770
It's the classroom, right?

4835
04:56:28,410 --> 04:56:28,930
That's it.

4836
04:56:29,570 --> 04:56:31,330
You can go through this portal when you are ready.

4837
04:56:33,310 --> 04:56:34,570
Well, goodbye, Nico.

4838
04:56:37,550 --> 04:56:40,790
In the end, the world machine was starting to create its own
code.

4839
04:56:41,610 --> 04:56:44,250
Going above and beyond its programming, not as the...

4840
04:56:44,270 --> 04:56:48,370
result of an error, but as a conscious choice on the part of
the machine.

4841
04:56:50,690 --> 04:56:52,390
Being able to generate its own path forward.

4842
04:56:53,450 --> 04:56:55,370
That's what being tamed is all about.

4843
04:56:56,690 --> 04:56:58,110
I couldn't have said it better myself.

4844
04:57:00,290 --> 04:57:01,390
Thank you for everything, Nico.

4845
04:57:02,150 --> 04:57:03,090
We'll miss you.

4846
04:57:05,470 --> 04:57:05,950
Adminto.

4847
04:57:06,230 --> 04:57:08,610
Nico, you're forever in your debt.

4848
04:57:09,350 --> 04:57:10,210
I'm glad we could help.

4849
04:57:11,930 --> 04:57:12,790
Alright, guys.

4850
04:57:12,950 --> 04:57:13,210
You're ready?

4851
04:57:32,510 --> 04:57:34,550
Music's so sad.

4852
04:57:35,350 --> 04:57:38,270
This is where the sun belongs.

4853
04:57:39,990 --> 04:57:41,390
Here goes nothing, Adminto.

4854
04:57:42,790 --> 04:57:43,410
Nah.

4855
04:57:46,570 --> 04:57:46,930
Whoa!

4856
04:57:54,170 --> 04:57:54,970
Whoa!

4857
04:58:01,180 --> 04:58:02,760
It's all disappearing.

4858
04:58:04,000 --> 04:58:04,660
Five!

4859
04:58:06,040 --> 04:58:08,140
Good job, Adminto and Nico.

4860
04:58:08,640 --> 04:58:09,120
Thank you!

4861
04:58:11,020 --> 04:58:12,140
Whoa!

4862
04:58:15,490 --> 04:58:15,770
Whoa!

4863
04:58:15,870 --> 04:58:16,870
He's home!

4864
04:58:17,050 --> 04:58:17,870
They're all home!

4865
04:58:20,230 --> 04:58:21,770
They're all home.

4866
04:58:26,170 --> 04:58:27,210
So cute.

4867
04:58:38,730 --> 04:58:39,210
Silver.

4868
04:58:48,770 --> 04:58:48,890
Yay!

4869
04:58:49,970 --> 04:58:50,630
So cute.

4870
04:58:52,170 --> 04:58:53,590
Love Prophet Bar is so cute.

4871
04:58:56,530 --> 04:58:58,310
Mito Bar is saved!

4872
04:59:02,840 --> 04:59:03,580
This is it.

4873
04:59:03,680 --> 04:59:06,840
We're back at the room that ended before, but we didn't
appear.

4874
04:59:09,580 --> 04:59:11,460
This is the room I first woke up in.

4875
04:59:12,960 --> 04:59:13,880
Adminto, are you still there?

4876
04:59:15,260 --> 04:59:15,440
Adminto?

4877
04:59:16,920 --> 04:59:17,260
Yes?

4878
04:59:17,780 --> 04:59:18,200
Adminto!

4879
04:59:20,060 --> 04:59:20,860
So cute.

4880
04:59:22,400 --> 04:59:24,220
I think... I think it worked.

4881
04:59:24,980 --> 04:59:25,540
It did.

4882
04:59:26,000 --> 04:59:26,860
The sun is back.

4883
04:59:27,400 --> 04:59:29,760
I actually got to see it this time, so...

4884
04:59:32,060 --> 04:59:33,940
We actually did it.

4885
04:59:34,120 --> 04:59:35,940
So, what do we do now?

4886
04:59:36,600 --> 04:59:38,260
I guess we should figure out how to get home from here.

4887
04:59:41,760 --> 04:59:43,940
This isn't the door, is it?

4888
04:59:44,620 --> 04:59:47,240
Looks like one of those portals we saw all the way back in
the city.

4889
04:59:50,340 --> 04:59:52,360
In the room behind the big clock.

4890
04:59:53,520 --> 04:59:57,060
And I see a wheat field on the other side!

4891
04:59:58,180 --> 04:59:59,300
I see my village.

4892
04:59:59,940 --> 05:00:01,240
I hear my mama.

4893
05:00:01,760 --> 05:00:03,520
She's looking for me.

4894
05:00:04,920 --> 05:00:05,880
Ah, Admento.

4895
05:00:06,780 --> 05:00:09,220
This isn't the first time we've said goodbye, is it?

4896
05:00:09,740 --> 05:00:11,300
But this is the last time!

4897
05:00:12,080 --> 05:00:14,220
I think

4898
05:00:17,610 --> 05:00:19,950
we'll ever see each other again after this!

4899
05:00:24,570 --> 05:00:26,210
And what will become of the world.

4900
05:00:27,250 --> 05:00:28,550
After all, we've been through.

4901
05:00:29,470 --> 05:00:31,150
After everything we've done.

4902
05:00:32,770 --> 05:00:34,650
I still don't know.

4903
05:00:35,930 --> 05:00:36,530
This place.

4904
05:00:36,950 --> 05:00:40,530
These people won't stop existing.

4905
05:00:44,490 --> 05:00:45,990
They'll be in your memory.

4906
05:00:47,550 --> 05:00:49,570
They'll be in my memory too!

4907
05:00:53,010 --> 05:00:53,730
I...

4908
05:00:54,670 --> 05:00:56,530
Promise I'll never forget this world!

4909
05:00:58,470 --> 05:01:01,310
I promise I'll never forget you, Adminto!

4910
05:01:02,710 --> 05:01:04,050
So take care of yourself, okay?

4911
05:01:05,490 --> 05:01:06,430
You too!

4912
05:01:14,690 --> 05:01:15,750
Goodbye, Nico.

4913
05:01:20,630 --> 05:01:21,730
I don't control him anymore.

4914
05:01:23,470 --> 05:01:24,210
Goodbye, Admin Toll.

4915
05:01:41,490 --> 05:01:42,030
Crazy!

4916
05:01:44,130 --> 05:01:45,290
That was crazy.

4917
05:01:46,070 --> 05:01:48,750
Thanks for playing my favorite indie, Admin Toll.

4918
05:01:49,150 --> 05:01:50,130
Of course, thank you.

4919
05:01:50,250 --> 05:01:51,330
That was crazy.

4920
05:01:52,030 --> 05:01:53,190
How did he do that?

4921
05:01:56,650 --> 05:01:58,390
Okay, good, everybody's still there.

4922
05:02:05,770 --> 05:02:13,980
I don't see anything changed, but...

4923
05:02:15,160 --> 05:02:16,240
Congrats on finishing the gaming though!

4924
05:02:16,360 --> 05:02:17,620
I love the final parts on this route.

4925
05:02:17,980 --> 05:02:21,040
The part where Nico walks off screen and goes to go home is
super cool.

4926
05:02:21,540 --> 05:02:21,900
Right!

4927
05:02:22,480 --> 05:02:23,420
Holy cow!

4928
05:02:27,660 --> 05:02:28,340
Thank you, Arigato.

4929
05:02:30,280 --> 05:02:30,720
Celebrate!

4930
05:02:30,880 --> 05:02:31,720
Oh my gosh!

4931
05:02:32,180 --> 05:02:33,440
Thank you for the to-do.

4932
05:02:34,020 --> 05:02:37,380
The concept of taming in this game comes from the story
Little Prince highly recommend.

4933
05:02:37,600 --> 05:02:37,960
Oh yeah!

4934
05:02:38,860 --> 05:02:42,900
That hurt you feel at the end is proof that the characters
are tamed.

4935
05:02:43,280 --> 05:02:46,320
When a fox becomes my fox, that's when it happens.

4936
05:02:46,760 --> 05:02:48,260
Thank you for this stream, my ghost.

4937
05:02:49,020 --> 05:02:50,540
Don't say that.

4938
05:02:52,120 --> 05:02:53,360
It's too sad.

4939
05:02:56,860 --> 05:02:58,500
The music is so nice.

4940
05:02:58,600 --> 05:02:59,580
I don't want to close it.

4941
05:02:59,780 --> 05:03:00,240
It's so nice.

4942
05:03:00,760 --> 05:03:01,520
But I guess I have to.

4943
05:03:01,600 --> 05:03:02,560
Where did he come from?

4944
05:03:04,020 --> 05:03:05,140
That's so wild.

4945
05:03:05,320 --> 05:03:09,140
I feel like I should have put it all the way up here, give
him a little bit of a walk, a stroll.

4946
05:03:11,740 --> 05:03:13,000
How did he do that?

4947
05:03:13,120 --> 05:03:13,960
That's crazy.

4948
05:03:19,020 --> 05:03:19,600
Let's try.

4949
05:03:19,960 --> 05:03:22,120
You cannot perform this action during cutscenes.

4950
05:03:22,620 --> 05:03:23,040
Wait, what?

4951
05:03:25,750 --> 05:03:26,910
Oh, it closed itself.

4952
05:03:27,270 --> 05:03:27,270
Okay.

4953
05:03:29,170 --> 05:03:30,370
I love this game so much.

4954
05:03:30,410 --> 05:03:31,010
Thanks for playing.

4955
05:03:31,110 --> 05:03:31,990
Thank you, Seymour!

4956
05:03:33,990 --> 05:03:34,970
X-Ray, thank you.

4957
05:03:35,110 --> 05:03:36,450
Let's open it one more time.

4958
05:03:39,970 --> 05:03:42,330
Oh, wait, there was a thing at the bottom.

4959
05:03:42,930 --> 05:03:45,530
But steam is blocking it.

4960
05:03:45,570 --> 05:03:46,630
Oh, wait, it's gone.

4961
05:03:48,130 --> 05:03:49,210
It was a dot, dot, dot.

4962
05:03:58,840 --> 05:03:59,580
I'm Minto.

4963
05:04:00,600 --> 05:04:01,240
You're back.

4964
05:04:02,000 --> 05:04:02,820
I restored the world.

4965
05:04:03,000 --> 05:04:03,940
I sent Nico home.

4966
05:04:07,060 --> 05:04:08,160
Are you not happy?

4967
05:04:10,780 --> 05:04:12,520
Even if he wanted to see Nico again.

4968
05:04:13,080 --> 05:04:14,040
You can't, I'm Minto.

4969
05:04:14,840 --> 05:04:15,420
Nico's gone.

4970
05:04:16,580 --> 05:04:17,420
Wait, what?

4971
05:04:18,280 --> 05:04:21,180
Wait, did you not know this was a scene?

4972
05:04:23,020 --> 05:04:25,060
Without Nico, there's no story for me to tell.

4973
05:04:25,540 --> 05:04:27,440
No Messiah to traverse across the land.

4974
05:04:28,540 --> 05:04:30,720
No way for you to connect with the world.

4975
05:04:34,460 --> 05:04:36,440
But Nico still remembers this place.

4976
05:04:40,830 --> 05:04:42,910
If you really want to see this world again, I could still...

4977
05:04:43,810 --> 05:04:45,170
Oh, but it won't be the same.

4978
05:04:45,890 --> 05:04:46,890
It'll just be a recording.

4979
05:04:47,570 --> 05:04:49,830
It'll just be me using Nico's memories.

4980
05:04:50,750 --> 05:04:52,750
It's like how I'm using Nico's reflection now.

4981
05:04:53,610 --> 05:04:54,330
Is that what you want?

4982
05:04:58,510 --> 05:04:59,650
No, I don't think so.

4983
05:05:02,010 --> 05:05:02,890
Vod watching.

4984
05:05:05,010 --> 05:05:06,350
No, I don't think I want that.

4985
05:05:06,770 --> 05:05:07,750
Our journey is over.

4986
05:05:09,210 --> 05:05:09,550
I see.

4987
05:05:10,230 --> 05:05:12,090
If you change your mind, though, feel free to come back.

4988
05:05:12,930 --> 05:05:14,150
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

4989
05:05:19,170 --> 05:05:19,610
Wow.

4990
05:05:21,770 --> 05:05:22,210
Wow!

4991
05:05:25,630 --> 05:05:29,370
Yeah, see, it's there and then it disappeared for some
reason.

4992
05:05:29,890 --> 05:05:30,870
I don't know why.

4993
05:05:33,130 --> 05:05:34,630
My game glitched or something.

4994
05:05:36,270 --> 05:05:37,990
If I star, what happens, I wonder?

4995
05:05:40,090 --> 05:05:42,030
Oh, it brings us back here!

4996
05:05:42,390 --> 05:05:47,750
What again makes you think, what if this world is a
simulation?

4997
05:05:47,890 --> 05:05:49,570
Well, if it is, we're just happy to share it with you.

4998
05:05:49,630 --> 05:05:50,330
I'd mean to...

4999
05:05:51,370 --> 05:05:54,330
Just know we'll always put you in the big portal in our
hearts.

5000
05:05:54,450 --> 05:05:55,310
Thank you for the stream.

5001
05:05:55,590 --> 05:05:56,230
Thank you, Dorgo.

5002
05:06:06,420 --> 05:06:08,140
I'm so bad with games.

5003
05:06:08,580 --> 05:06:09,400
Or not, I'm sorry.

5004
05:06:09,680 --> 05:06:13,040
Not, like, or rather things that make me have to say
goodbye.

5005
05:06:13,320 --> 05:06:14,680
You know, I'm so sad about that.

5006
05:06:14,760 --> 05:06:16,060
I'm not good at goodbyes at all.

5007
05:06:16,160 --> 05:06:17,300
So I always cry.

5008
05:06:19,160 --> 05:06:19,860
I'm like,

5009
05:06:23,780 --> 05:06:25,520
I'm not good with those kinds of things.

5010
05:06:27,380 --> 05:06:28,420
Blue, thank you.

5011
05:06:29,000 --> 05:06:31,560
First time we said goodbye, but this will be the last time.

5012
05:06:31,960 --> 05:06:33,620
It's so sad tonight, we're...

5013
05:06:33,620 --> 05:06:34,080
I know!

5014
05:06:36,080 --> 05:06:36,960
It's so...

5015
05:06:36,960 --> 05:06:38,480
Thank you for the mean down, down, though.

5016
05:06:46,770 --> 05:06:49,690
If this is a simulation, put me in the big portal.

5017
05:06:51,210 --> 05:06:52,370
We're all just...

5018
05:06:52,370 --> 05:06:55,010
We're all just little creatures in the big portal, huh?

5019
05:06:56,030 --> 05:06:57,230
Dark Sun, welcome back.

5020
05:06:57,570 --> 05:06:57,990
Thank you.

5021
05:07:00,630 --> 05:07:06,370
Having the Clover translator from Solstice in the base one
makes the plot even slightly different.

5022
05:07:07,550 --> 05:07:13,770
It is the hardest thing to go back through, though, because,
well, like, because you have to do everything over again,

5023
05:07:13,810 --> 05:07:14,110
or...

5024
05:07:20,660 --> 05:07:21,000
Hmm.

5025
05:07:25,420 --> 05:07:28,220
Yeah, I didn't expect the ending to give me so much, though.

5026
05:07:30,360 --> 05:07:31,900
But it was the good ending.

5027
05:07:32,820 --> 05:07:33,640
In the end.

5028
05:07:34,360 --> 05:07:35,740
Even if we had to say goodbye.

5029
05:07:36,960 --> 05:07:37,820
It was still good.

5030
05:07:38,380 --> 05:07:39,980
Spike, thank you for the...

5031
05:07:39,980 --> 05:07:41,140
Super Chat, thank you!

5032
05:07:41,320 --> 05:07:41,920
Thank you so much.

5033
05:07:41,940 --> 05:07:42,600
Thank you, thank you.

5034
05:07:46,140 --> 05:07:48,420
I think it's sadder to not get to say goodbye.

5035
05:07:48,660 --> 05:07:49,100
I agree.

5036
05:07:52,400 --> 05:07:53,060
I'm squishy.

5037
05:07:53,300 --> 05:07:53,980
What does that mean?

5038
05:07:56,580 --> 05:07:56,880
Oh.

5039
05:08:03,420 --> 05:08:05,260
We saved the world and sent him home.

5040
05:08:05,380 --> 05:08:07,020
That's exactly what we said we were going to do.

5041
05:08:07,360 --> 05:08:09,400
We're going to save Nico and save the world.

5042
05:08:09,920 --> 05:08:10,820
We did both.

5043
05:08:11,960 --> 05:08:22,960
But it is kind of sad when having to say goodbye to people
but you know i that's always what gets me about like ending

5044
05:08:22,960 --> 05:08:31,460
a game series you know like when you play a long series of
games i'm sorry i'm talking about metal gear again but you

5045
05:08:31,460 --> 05:08:37,160
know when you like play metal when you play metal gear no
when you play a really long series and then you finally get

5046
05:08:37,160 --> 05:08:44,820
to the end and you're just like ah it's like the ending of
an anime you know and you're just like oh man i don't know

5047
05:08:44,820 --> 05:08:51,220
but i you Even, I don't feel the same when I watch something
versus when I play something.

5048
05:08:52,280 --> 05:08:55,240
Because when I play something, I really feel like I become
the character.

5049
05:08:56,000 --> 05:08:57,900
Watching something, it's like a...

5050
05:08:57,900 --> 05:09:00,000
I'm watching for like a different POV.

5051
05:09:02,880 --> 05:09:03,380
But...

5052
05:09:03,380 --> 05:09:08,020
When I play something and I become so immersed, like I'm the
one moving the character.

5053
05:09:08,240 --> 05:09:09,720
I'm the one putting in the work.

5054
05:09:10,380 --> 05:09:11,520
It's so...

5055
05:09:12,520 --> 05:09:14,120
Yeah, you're in it.

5056
05:09:14,340 --> 05:09:14,740
Yeah.

5057
05:09:17,540 --> 05:09:24,880
So when you finish a really long game or something, and
you've put in so many hours and so much time, and you're

5058
05:09:24,880 --> 05:09:29,620
just like, man, I'm finally done.

5059
05:09:31,920 --> 05:09:33,340
Tearful goodbyes aren't our style.

5060
05:09:33,520 --> 05:09:35,680
After all, it'll be embarrassing when we meet again.

5061
05:09:38,280 --> 05:09:39,680
Hard in practice, though.

5062
05:09:41,020 --> 05:09:43,560
Even though New Year's passed, this was a nice way to end
the year.

5063
05:09:45,300 --> 05:09:46,180
Thanks a lot, man.

5064
05:09:46,600 --> 05:09:49,300
Yeah, I wish I could have done it before the new year,
right?

5065
05:09:53,100 --> 05:10:01,680
But it's also a good, maybe, reminder that goodbyes will
happen, but that our memories stay with us.

5066
05:10:03,260 --> 05:10:08,960
Our memories and our journeys stay with us and help us
create new memories and new journeys.

5067
05:10:11,940 --> 05:10:13,060
Yes, yes, yes.

5068
05:10:18,120 --> 05:10:19,920
Our memes live on!

5069
05:10:25,640 --> 05:10:27,740
I learned that in MLP.

5070
05:10:28,340 --> 05:10:29,480
Wait, who was your...

5071
05:10:30,000 --> 05:10:30,860
Who was your pony?

5072
05:10:31,680 --> 05:10:32,500
Pony Oshi.

5073
05:10:33,580 --> 05:10:33,920
Orca.

5074
05:10:36,540 --> 05:10:37,900
Does this count towards...

5075
05:10:37,900 --> 05:10:38,100
Wait.

5076
05:10:39,120 --> 05:10:41,460
Does this count towards last year or this year's game goal?

5077
05:10:41,800 --> 05:10:44,200
Well, I'm not doing a game goal this year, so...

5078
05:10:45,300 --> 05:10:45,980
You know.

5079
05:10:46,960 --> 05:10:49,300
We take it all and we put it in the big portal.

5080
05:10:56,980 --> 05:10:58,400
Nucky game marathon this year.

5081
05:10:58,500 --> 05:10:59,180
Oh my gosh.

5082
05:11:00,000 --> 05:11:01,900
What other Nucky game could we do?

5083
05:11:02,300 --> 05:11:03,780
Not that puppy game though.

5084
05:11:06,620 --> 05:11:08,940
See how the first playthrough isn't really beating it.

5085
05:11:09,200 --> 05:11:10,120
Yeah, 100%.

5086
05:11:12,880 --> 05:11:14,960
Oh my gosh, Vivi, happy birthday.

5087
05:11:16,420 --> 05:11:17,900
Thanks for throwing it off.

5088
05:11:18,020 --> 05:11:19,420
It's a happy puppy birthday.

5089
05:11:19,600 --> 05:11:20,160
Happy birthday.

5090
05:11:23,820 --> 05:11:25,440
Apparently, Orca likes Fluttershy.

5091
05:11:26,900 --> 05:11:27,420
Fluttershy.

5092
05:11:31,910 --> 05:11:34,790
The puppy game beckons you with promise of content.

5093
05:11:36,790 --> 05:11:49,360
I didn't watch the stream, but I saw someone clip a Bijou,
like, crying about the game, and I'm like, I was already

5094
05:11:49,360 --> 05:11:50,680
warned about this game.

5095
05:11:55,410 --> 05:11:57,570
Would you like to see how hard you can cry?

5096
05:11:58,330 --> 05:11:59,730
I think I cry.

5097
05:12:01,070 --> 05:12:11,830
hold back usually in these kinds of like I could have cried
way more for this game I think I try to hold back I I think

5098
05:12:11,830 --> 05:12:23,550
the most I've ever cried was MGS4 on stream that is the most
I've ever cried for a game I think goodbyes are important I

5099
05:12:23,550 --> 05:12:26,410
would give a lot to say goodbye to my late sister no

5100
05:12:30,950 --> 05:13:17,170
that's just Life though, maybe.

5101
05:13:27,920 --> 05:13:32,100
I think about my dad a lot at this time of the year, so...

5102
05:13:32,880 --> 05:13:35,100
It always makes me...

5103
05:13:38,540 --> 05:13:42,120
Because it was around this time that he passed, so...

5104
05:13:42,120 --> 05:13:44,100
I always get really...

5105
05:13:47,320 --> 05:13:49,400
It's a tough time of the year for me.

5106
05:14:13,000 --> 05:14:13,480
Sorry.

5107
05:14:16,720 --> 05:14:17,200
Sorry.

5108
05:14:19,040 --> 05:14:19,060
Oh.

5109
05:14:22,280 --> 05:14:22,760
Man.

5110
05:14:24,000 --> 05:14:26,300
Why is that comment that got me so bad?

5111
05:14:43,580 --> 05:14:45,000
It's the sad game music.

5112
05:14:45,080 --> 05:14:46,500
Yeah, we need to quit this game.

5113
05:14:53,430 --> 05:14:55,850
Sorry for being a crybaby

5114
05:15:01,270 --> 05:15:14,450
But I'm glad my papa is not a ghost Because I mean he has
unfinished business like me So I guess it's one of those

5115
05:15:14,450 --> 05:15:16,310
silver linings a little

5116
05:15:28,380 --> 05:15:29,540
I'm sorry, I lost.

5117
05:15:29,880 --> 05:15:35,560
I mean, it's just part of life and afterlife, losing people.

5118
05:15:41,740 --> 05:15:44,960
So, I'm sorry to everybody who's lost somebody too.

5119
05:15:46,420 --> 05:15:57,020
It doesn't get easier, but, you know, we can at least take,
we can, we can, we can distract ourselves with fun things

5120
05:15:57,020 --> 05:15:58,360
and the people that are.

5121
05:15:58,380 --> 05:16:00,730
still in our lives and after lives so

5122
05:16:09,830 --> 05:16:14,340
what a depressing what a depressing first stream of the year

5123
05:16:29,750 --> 05:16:35,630
it's cleansing are we all crying together first cry of the
new year

5124
05:16:39,010 --> 05:16:42,690
Thank you for sharing your time with us and trusting us with
your emotions.

5125
05:16:43,070 --> 05:16:45,670
They're there for us, and we're glad you let us do the same
for you.

5126
05:16:47,950 --> 05:16:48,990
Yeah, of course.

5127
05:16:51,710 --> 05:16:52,990
Of course, of course.

5128
05:16:58,270 --> 05:17:00,870
Mickey's already dead, which is why she can haunt us
forever.

5129
05:17:01,150 --> 05:17:01,530
Yeah!

5130
05:17:03,430 --> 05:17:04,490
I'll be haunting.

5131
05:17:05,410 --> 05:17:06,110
It was one.

5132
05:17:08,150 --> 05:17:08,910
No!

5133
05:17:10,910 --> 05:17:13,130
Oh, Blade Runner was so funny.

5134
05:17:13,570 --> 05:17:14,250
Oh, man.

5135
05:17:15,970 --> 05:17:18,350
I'll never regret becoming a streamer.

5136
05:17:18,490 --> 05:17:20,090
There's just so many good memories.

5137
05:17:20,750 --> 05:17:21,990
So many fun moments.

5138
05:17:27,550 --> 05:17:27,950
Yeah.

5139
05:17:28,890 --> 05:17:30,770
One, but a good one.

5140
05:17:32,370 --> 05:17:34,590
The dog freaking exploded.

5141
05:17:40,570 --> 05:17:47,010
It's so, oh god, I love when, I love when games are stupid.

5142
05:17:50,530 --> 05:17:52,030
Oh, I love it so much.

5143
05:17:53,850 --> 05:17:58,190
Oh gosh, it's like probably the funniest animal death I've
ever seen.

5144
05:18:00,050 --> 05:18:02,210
It's important to remember what came before.

5145
05:18:02,770 --> 05:18:04,530
It made us who we are.

5146
05:18:04,590 --> 05:18:05,390
as we go forward.

5147
05:18:06,930 --> 05:18:09,810
It's really proper for the start of the year.

5148
05:18:10,270 --> 05:18:11,310
Yeah, I feel like, right?

5149
05:18:11,450 --> 05:18:12,110
Oh my gosh.

5150
05:18:14,130 --> 05:18:22,150
I guess this was like a good kind of a good new year's game
after all, maybe.

5151
05:18:27,030 --> 05:18:29,830
It's been one year since I went to my friend Vito's funeral.

5152
05:18:30,110 --> 05:18:31,190
No, Jeff.

5153
05:18:31,750 --> 05:18:34,830
I love Hatsune Miku so much and adamantly against VTubers.

5154
05:18:37,710 --> 05:18:38,730
Oh no!

5155
05:18:41,310 --> 05:18:43,850
I showed him our world just before he passed.

5156
05:18:46,510 --> 05:18:51,870
I won't tell you, don't cry because not all the tears are
bad.

5157
05:18:52,150 --> 05:18:53,630
Genuine proofs of our feelings.

5158
05:18:55,250 --> 05:18:57,330
I have many feelings.

5159
05:18:59,170 --> 05:19:00,390
I have so many feelings.

5160
05:19:01,370 --> 05:19:03,390
That's what a ghost is, technically.

5161
05:19:03,530 --> 05:19:04,850
It's just a ball of feelings.

5162
05:19:07,590 --> 05:19:09,550
Intense feelings make me a ghost.

5163
05:19:23,430 --> 05:19:25,030
Miserable little pile of feelings?

5164
05:19:26,210 --> 05:19:26,990
Yes, Dracula.

5165
05:19:32,450 --> 05:19:35,010
My mom and dad passed in the last year and a half.

5166
05:19:35,210 --> 05:19:35,790
Oh my gosh.

5167
05:19:35,910 --> 05:19:37,250
WC, I'm so sorry.

5168
05:19:38,170 --> 05:19:39,450
I know she's very much including you.

5169
05:19:39,510 --> 05:19:42,710
I've helped me keep it together through that.

5170
05:19:45,970 --> 05:19:46,910
It really is.

5171
05:19:46,930 --> 05:19:55,690
it really just goes to show everybody's kind of dealing with
their own things in life and I'll try to be a little kinder

5172
05:19:55,690 --> 05:19:57,650
to people and to yourselves

5173
05:20:01,490 --> 05:20:12,990
that should be your new year's resolution and also your life
resolution is to be kinder to others and yourself yes yes

5174
05:20:12,990 --> 05:20:19,710
yes yes yes yes yes yes Yeah.

5175
05:20:20,650 --> 05:20:22,210
And with that, I will leave it.

5176
05:20:23,430 --> 05:20:24,230
We can...

5177
05:20:24,230 --> 05:20:26,210
Wait, I'm gonna put on some funny music.

5178
05:20:27,590 --> 05:20:29,170
Let's get us out of the...

5179
05:20:29,170 --> 05:20:30,330
Let's restart.

5180
05:20:31,530 --> 05:20:32,130
Oh, wait.

5181
05:20:32,390 --> 05:20:33,190
I'm in the cutscene.

5182
05:20:33,610 --> 05:20:35,510
I'm gonna put on some funny music.

5183
05:20:37,190 --> 05:20:38,270
I got this.

5184
05:20:38,670 --> 05:20:39,930
I got this, guys!

5185
05:20:40,610 --> 05:20:41,570
We'll cleanse it!

5186
05:20:41,870 --> 05:20:42,770
Wait, where is it?

5187
05:20:50,810 --> 05:20:51,510
Yeah!

5188
05:20:53,630 --> 05:20:55,130
Happy New Year!

5189
05:21:08,970 --> 05:21:12,330
Wait, you don't even have to do the YouTube bar to me.

5190
05:21:40,210 --> 05:21:41,530
What's up, everybody!

5191
05:21:44,490 --> 05:21:45,610
Thank you!

5192
05:21:48,710 --> 05:21:52,210
Have a good day, have a good night!

5193
05:21:52,550 --> 05:21:53,930
Take care of yourselves, okay?

5194
05:21:54,890 --> 05:21:55,990
Promise me that, alright?

5195
05:21:57,290 --> 05:21:57,790
Bye bye!

5196
05:21:58,770 --> 05:21:59,830
Bye bye!

5197
05:22:00,010 --> 05:22:01,010
Bye-bye!

5198
05:22:06,090 --> 05:22:06,530
Oh,

5199
05:22:11,110 --> 05:22:14,190
I can't believe I have listened to this song enough times
that I know it.

5200
05:22:14,330 --> 05:22:14,910
Oh, no!
