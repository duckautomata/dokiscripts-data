1
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,380
Sorry I was late.

2
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,860
For the stream.

3
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,540
Sorry.

4
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,460
Sorry I was late.

5
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,680
And sorry that my... I don't know why the music was muted in the beginning.

6
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
I have no idea.

7
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,860
That is so weird.

8
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,320
That is so weird!

9
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,700
I don't know.

10
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,140
I don't know.

11
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,760
It took five extra minutes to grow a mustache.

12
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,920
No.

13
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,500
It takes me like two seconds to grow a mustache.

14
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,660
It's like so easy.

15
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,620
I didn't touch anything either.

16
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,220
I don't know.

17
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,160
My audio has been kind of weird today.

18
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,060
A little bit weird.

19
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,260
I don't know.

20
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,800
Do you guys notice anything different about me?

21
00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:01,120
Or like anything... anything interesting about me today?

22
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,380
Do you notice anything like peculiar?

23
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,360
Something that you're like hmm... I don't remember that being there before.

24
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,640
Do you notice anything?

25
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,280
My neck is longer?

26
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:16,780
No.

27
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,300
More ribbons?

28
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,640
No.

29
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,400
New hair?

30
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:21,780
No.

31
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,300
New contacts?

32
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,700
No.

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,020
My drawing tablet?

34
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,240
Exactly!

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,100
And also...

36
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,500
Oh my gosh.

37
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,800
Sorry.

38
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,080
There's construction outside.

39
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,100
If you hear... I was like hoping that they would stop before.

40
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,940
By now I was just like clearly... surely it's later in the day.

41
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,180
They're not going to do any more construction.

42
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,620
But no.

43
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,460
They are doing all the construction.

44
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,660
And they're being so loud about it.

45
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,660
And so I...

46
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,840
Sorry.

47
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,880
I was waiting.

48
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,940
I was like waiting a little bit for it to end.

49
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,280
But it never did.

50
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,300
But look at this you guys.

51
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,720
Look at this.

52
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,360
I have a phantom hand!

53
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,460
It's... it's... it's not my hand.

54
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,500
You know how in like the Addams Family there's that little hand that like...

55
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:17,640
You know how in like the Addams Family there's that little hand that like...

56
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,080
Does all the work?

57
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,580
So technically I'm not drawing today.

58
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,180
It's our little hand friend.

59
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,720
Yeah the thing!

60
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,820
Andricos!

61
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,440
Thank you!

62
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,040
Thank...

63
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,100
Whoa.

64
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,760
You.

65
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,420
Thanks.

66
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,140
And my hand says thank you also.

67
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,960
That's so creepy.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,680
I love it.

69
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,500
Oh god.

70
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,200
What are you saying?

71
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,580
Oh my god!

72
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,300
No!

73
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,200
Hand!

74
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:04,600
No!

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,500
Stop!

76
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:05,880
Stop!

77
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,160
Stop!

78
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,500
Hold on.

79
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,760
Hold on.

80
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,640
Hold on.

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,660
Okay.

82
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,820
Write something nice, hand.

83
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,700
Write something nice.

84
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,460
Write something nice.

85
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,000
Like mint... M for Minto?

86
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,000
U.

87
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,880
Mmm... mud?

88
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Mermaid!

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,700
Merm... Mird!

90
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,640
Oh no!

91
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,100
Oh my god!

92
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,380
Oh my god!

93
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,520
No!

94
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,300
Stop it!

95
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,240
Stop it, hand!

96
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,820
Stop it!

97
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,580
Oh my...

98
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,920
Oh my...

99
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,300
Red rub!

100
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,100
Red rub!

101
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,000
Is the Google form submission already over?

102
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,720
It is.

103
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,140
As you can see in the pinned comment, it says that it would end two hours.

104
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,980
The deadline was two hours before stream.

105
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,380
So I'm so sorry if we didn't make it this time.

106
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,620
But...

107
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,740
Turn that frown upside down because I'll do this again someday.

108
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,640
Yeah.

109
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,940
The minty?

110
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,340
The minty?

111
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,500
Um...

112
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,760
Okay.

113
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,480
Rocket R.

114
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,620
The minty.

115
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,380
Turn that frown upside down.

116
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,420
No.

117
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,000
Upside down.

118
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,060
The minky?

119
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:46,720
No!

120
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,660
Today, I'll be drawing...

121
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,780
You!

122
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,140
I'll be drawing you!

123
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,720
Just like that!

124
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,400
Well, this hand will be drawing you.

125
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,240
But...

126
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,540
I'll be drawing your profile pictures...

127
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,940
Um...

128
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,780
Uh...

129
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,740
Just however I want to.

130
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,500
Um...

131
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,640
I had a little Google form rather than having like...

132
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:40,620
Okay, so, okay, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, okay, hold on, hold on, honesty is the best policy, okay, everybody, okay, so, hold on, honest, honest ghost, I'm an honest ghost, okay, hey, I'm dragon, thank you for the 10 gifts, and thank you, um, so, usually,

133
00:08:40,620 --> 00:09:08,780
like, I feel like whenever people are like, I'm gonna draw your profile pictures, this and that, whatever, it's like, you know, you donate, like, you know, you donate a, or something, and, uh, and, uh, then, um, an X, yeah, you donate, no, yeah, X on this,

134
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,540
X on this, um, the rotation.

135
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:42,860
And one, you're the vibe gift, and thank you, um, but, um, you know, sometimes I think, um, you know, I think that's a little sad for other people wanting to get profile pictures as well, but also, um, we're gonna change the honest ghost to, I

136
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:54,190
become an overwhelmed ghost, because sometimes, too many people send in, you know what I'm saying?

137
00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:00,130
And so, then I'm like, wait, wait, there's too many, I can't, I can't do all that.

138
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:12,110
And then I have this, this compounding guilt, guilt, guilt, this is how my, my guilt, my, my guilt, because then I'm just like, oh my gosh, there's way too many!

139
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,950
And I get scared.

140
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,970
So today, I can choose as many as I want to do.

141
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:27,450
My guilt, so I can be guilt-free, because I can say, oh, I feel like doing one more today.

142
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,130
So, um, I get to choose, and you win.

143
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,950
Hold on, um, how do you, okay, hold on.

144
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,540
That's a hand pointing at you.

145
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,400
You, you win.

146
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,280
Thank you, thank you.

147
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,080
You win, thank you.

148
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,200
You win, because it's free.

149
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,980
Thank you, thank you.

150
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,540
Thank you.

151
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,640
How many souls were sacrificed for that hand?

152
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,420
Also, thank you so much for singing Love Deterrence yesterday.

153
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,320
You have no idea how long I've waited for you to sing this.

154
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,680
I've been jamming to it, driving to and from work for a year!

155
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,840
Now I can switch it with yours.

156
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,000
Please don't do that.

157
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,500
Don't do that.

158
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,320
I, I feel like...

159
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,000
We win because it's time with you.

160
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,400
Mint found a ghost rider?

161
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,960
No way.

162
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:36,060
So, how this is gonna work is I had a Google form that people would fill out and submit their usernames and, um, and, uh, a request.

163
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:49,660
Um, I might, I'll be honest, I'm probably not gonna remember what your or know what your profile picture already is, because as I see it they're like, see, this is me and my big head.

164
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,720
Like this.

165
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,960
Oh my god, there's construction.

166
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,180
Like that.

167
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,000
I look like that.

168
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,240
And then your profile picture on YouTube is like this.

169
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,300
And I'm like, Hey there.

170
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,780
You.

171
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,760
You.

172
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,720
You right there.

173
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,700
You.

174
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,340
You look like a little fly.

175
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,340
That's you.

176
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,480
So, uh, you can't see this.

177
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,940
I can't tell what you are.

178
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,920
Like what your profile...

179
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,840
Sometimes I can.

180
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,060
Sometimes it's like I'm like, oh, that's a car.

181
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,680
Um...

182
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,480
Oh, that's, that's, uh, you know, that's that VTuber or that's that character.

183
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,340
Um...

184
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,400
But other times I'm like, I can't tell.

185
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,180
That's a cat.

186
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
I can see the cat.

187
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,120
But, um, yeah, other times I can't tell at all.

188
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, you guys.

189
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,540
You guys.

190
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,260
I must tell you.

191
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,200
I must tell you.

192
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,960
Um, but, oh.

193
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,740
Before I tell you, um...

194
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,660
But yeah, I have a whole list of people.

195
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
Uh, here.

196
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,340
We'll spin the great wheel.

197
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,320
And it will land...

198
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,180
You have a one in...

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
Uh...

200
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,640
Uh...

201
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,140
Uh...

202
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,800
Uh...

203
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,540
I'm still scrolling.

204
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,740
One in...

205
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,440
1,354 chance...

206
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,420
of getting picked.

207
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,420
1 in...

208
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,800
It's better than gotcha odds, everybody!

209
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,280
It's better than gotcha odds, everybody!

210
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,100
So, um...

211
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,820
Yep, I'm on the screen.

212
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:45,920
That's your name!

213
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,440
Right there.

214
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,680
Maybe.

215
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,160
Probably.

216
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,900
But yeah, so, I'll pick the wheel.

217
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,160
I'll pick someone from the wheel.

218
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,840
And that way it's very... it's fair.

219
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,080
Um, you know.

220
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,720
And anybody has a chance to get a profile picture.

221
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,200
I put in a little thing saying like, Hey, do you have a request?

222
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,980
Um...

223
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,900
But, uh...

224
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,680
Nah, I'd win.

225
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,860
Uh, do you have a request?

226
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,680
And if it's just like, Draw me like one of your French ladies.

227
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,760
Then I can...

228
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,600
Potentially do that.

229
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,220
Wait.

230
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,040
Who gifted five members?

231
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,760
Wait.

232
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,600
Unless that's old.

233
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,120
Oh yeah, that's the rotund one.

234
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,160
Oh, but...

235
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,280
Thank you for the ten gifted.

236
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,780
Thank you!

237
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,120
Sorry, I missed that one earlier.

238
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,660
Haha.

239
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,780
This game makes you feel like being a fly.

240
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,440
What do you mean by that?

241
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,920
Ma, get the camera!

242
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,140
You're so small.

243
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,000
You are.

244
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,740
You're very cute.

245
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,320
Hold on.

246
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,640
You're so small and you're so cute.

247
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,680
Ooh.

248
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,100
Ooh, there's your blushing.

249
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,060
You're like, oh my gosh, I'm so small.

250
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,780
See that wheel?

251
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,780
It's all me.

252
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,800
But I have a thing to tell you guys.

253
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,760
Let me...

254
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,660
Let me get it real quick first though.

255
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,300
Hold on.

256
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,560
Hold on.

257
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,460
Hold on.

258
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,060
Hold on.

259
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,400
Hold on.

260
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,080
One moment.

261
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,540
Oh, sorry.

262
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,560
That was very loud.

263
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,420
Even for me.

264
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:27,920
Apologies.

265
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,300
Oh, I forgot to say!

266
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,140
I forgot to greet you guys to the stream because I was so...

267
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,480
I was so flustered.

268
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:37,960
Thank you!

269
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,240
Thank you!

270
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:38,840
Kiss!

271
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,880
Kiss!

272
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,280
Thank you!

273
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,420
Using the color red to write is really tempting.

274
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,560
For what?

275
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,560
Okay.

276
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,140
I have something.

277
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,060
This is one thing to show.

278
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,980
So I...

279
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,400
Hold on.

280
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,080
Actually...

281
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,760
Hold on.

282
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,840
Can I save on both at the same time?

283
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,600
Oh, no!

284
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,860
These are all individual!

285
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,640
Actually, I can just screenshot it.

286
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,660
Screenshot.

287
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,040
Hold on.

288
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,880
I should have prepared this before stream.

289
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,160
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

290
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,960
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

291
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
Thank you guys so much!

292
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:19,660
Thank you!

293
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:19,860
Thank you!

294
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,100
Thank you!

295
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,140
Let's see.

296
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,440
Okay.

297
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:21,740
Hold on.

298
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,500
Okay.

299
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:23,900
Here we go.

300
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,020
Shoo!

301
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,060

302
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,500

304
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,000
Shoo!

305
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,660
Shoo!

306
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,100
Shoo!

307
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Shoo!

308
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,460
Shoo!

309
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:29,560
Shoo!

310
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:29,740
Shoo!

311
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:29,960
Shoo!

312
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,160
Shoo!

313
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,680
Shoo!

314
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,940
Okay.

315
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,380
I have...

316
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,700
More emotes!

317
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,720
This first batch...

318
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,260
is from Wealthy!

319
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,620
Yippee!

320
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:51,800
Hold on.

321
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,680
Sorry.

322
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,660
I gotta erase you.

323
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,320
There we go.

324
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,500
Yeah!

325
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,620
More emotes!

326
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,540
And that's not all.

327
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,900
I have...

328
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,480
Even more...

329
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,320
emotes!

330
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,760
These ones are from...

331
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,920
Junya!

332
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,840
Yeah.

333
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,260
I'll upload them...

334
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,800
after stream.

335
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,200
Yeah!

336
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
We have lots more emotes!

337
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,320
Even more...

338
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,560
emotes!

339
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,980
So...

340
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,920
I asked members...

341
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,600
what kind of emotes...

342
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
you'd be interested in.

343
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,400
Some people were like...

344
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,480
Oh!

345
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,340
I want a box!

346
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:44,760
Oh!

347
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,360
I want a clown!

348
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,220
So...

349
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,500
Oh!

350
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,740
I want a nerd!

351
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:50,980
Oh!

352
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,580
I want...

353
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,400
I want this!

354
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,140
I want a penlight!

355
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,620
Okay!

356
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,220
I...

357
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,840
Your wish is my command!

358
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,520
Raymak thinks of the five gifts!

359
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,600
So...

360
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,180
I cry when I fart!

361
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh my gosh.

362
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,000
Are you okay?

363
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,260
Welcome to membership!

364
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,140
We are so back again!

365
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,720
Yeah.

366
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,320
I thought they're...

367
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,300
I think they're very cute.

368
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,620
You have a bonk!

369
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,520
You have a pray!

370
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,680
You have a wink!

371
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,680

You have a... Oh my god!

376
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,400
Did she really just say that?

377
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,100
This isn't all the emotes.

378
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,340
This is just what I got for now.

379
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:33,860
But...

380
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,960
Yeah!

381
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,740
So...

382
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Welcome to membership!

383
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,020
Thank you!

384
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,760
Thank you guys!

385
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,700
I will upload these...

386
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:50,980
soon.

387
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
As goes to...

388
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,380
As goes to...

389
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:00,640
As goes to...

390
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,920
Thank you!

391
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,420
Thank you!

392
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,580
Thank you!

393
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,180
It's raining gifts!

394
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,860
Oh my god.

395
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,640
I know, right?

396
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,780
Holy moly!

397
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,740
Um...

398
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,080
Let's get started.

399
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,940
Ducky, thanks for the five!

400
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,540
Thank you!

401
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,300
Hold on.

402
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,680
Thank you!

403
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,760
Thank you!

404
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,760
I was like, why does my throat feel a little weird?

405
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,520
I forgot to take my medicine before.

406
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,440
Thank you!

407
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,440
Thanks for the...

408
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,100
Thanks for the five gifted!

409
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,060
Thanks for the ten gifted!

410
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,480
Oh my god!

411
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,280
Customer Johnson!

412
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,560
Thanks for the aqua super!

413
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,400
I want to say thank you for the relay karaoke yesterday.

414
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,380
I listened and watched the whole stream once live.

415
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,860
And once on VOD!

416
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,120
No!

417
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,100
You did Heaven's Abide, Sins of the Father, Love Deterrents, and Snake Eater so well.

418
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,140
It made me realize you have...

419
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,300
You can express your love for your passions uninhibited and unabashed.

420
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,680
Thank you!

421
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,240
Wait, what do you mean one out of blank?

422
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,180
Tee-ka!

423
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,140
Thanks for the gifted!

424
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,060
One out of question mark.

425
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,580
I'm scared.

426
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,160
Thank you!

427
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,900
Let's do our first person.

428
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,660
Uncanny scary mint emote win.

429
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,320
What do you mean?

430
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,460
I'm not scary.

431
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,660
I'm Moe.

432
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,180
Moe.

433
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,660
I'm Moe.

434
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm Moe.

435
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,520
Hold on.

436
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,360
I don't think you can read it.

437
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,000
Moe!

438
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,260
I mean I know I'm a ghost.

439
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,180
But like...

440
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,820
I'm a cute ghost.

441
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,740
Because I'm amazing!

442
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,040
Duh!

443
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,460
Duh!

444
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,700
Alright, let's pick our first victim.

445
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,560
Person.

446
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,540
I will spin the wheel.

447
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,000
The winner is...

448
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,460
Turtle!

449
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,060
We can't see it.

450
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,580
I know you won't see it until...

451
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,620
the name is pulled.

452
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,960
Because I'll be honest.

453
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,340
I have not vetted these.

454
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,620
I just copied and pasted them.

455
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,580
Because there were so many.

456
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,700
What if someone is trolling me?

457
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,320
And says something weird?

458
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,420
And then it just shows up...

459
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,020
on my screen.

460
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,800
Turtle!

461
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,920
Oh my gosh, I get to draw a turtle!

462
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,540
Hold on.

463
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,580
Let's see what turtle...

464
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,880
requested.

465
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,880
And there's...

466
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,480
Oh.

467
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,540
Thanks for staying true to yourself.

468
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,980
And being an inspiration to many.

469
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,440
Which includes me as well.

470
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,360
Two out of I don't know why I decided to go on about it.

471
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,160
When I have nothing else to say.

472
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,820
Plus I'm broke!

473
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,340
Please don't.

474
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,400
Is this me or someone else?

475
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,160
I don't know.

476
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,540
Turtle?

477
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,300
Did you put turtle or turtles?

478
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,100
But thank you customer Johnson!

479
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,720
Thank you!

480
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,060
Let's see.

481
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:00,900
Turtle...

482
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,280
Oh.

483
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,760
Wait.

484
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,360
Several people asked for turtles.

485
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:06,900
Oh wait.

486
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,860
Turtle asked for a turtle wearing sunglasses.

487
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,000
Wait.

488
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,060
Several people asked for a turtle...

489
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,240
wearing sunglasses.

490
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,460
Oh wait.

491
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,640
No.

492
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:18,900
Sorry.

493
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,880
That's just turtle.

494
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,580
Turtles I'm sorry.

495
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,720
I think this is different.

496
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,420
Because there's turtle and then there's turtles.

497
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,580
And you're turtles.

498
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,600
And you're turtles.

499
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,740
You asked for a turtle.

500
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,880
Turtle doesn't sound like a real word anymore.

501
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,360
Turtle doesn't sound like a real word anymore.

502
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,160
That's not me.

503
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,360
I'm sorry.

504
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,280
So close.

505
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,700
You could steal it if you wanted to.

506
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,060
You could steal it if you wanted to.

507
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,320
But it's gonna have sunglasses you know.

508
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,980
Hope you had a good day.

509
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,980
Because I had an interesting one.

510
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,560
Three black bears decided to camp my house.

511
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,600
And not let me leave for five hours.

512
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:03,930
Three black bears decided to camp my house.

513
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,590
Did they stand like this?

514
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,350
Did they stand like...

515
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,830
kind of all...

516
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,250
Bear standing emoji.

517
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,150
Bear standing emoji.

518
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,250
Can

519
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,460
I pet that dog?

520
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,120
No!

521
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,060
It's not a dog!

522
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:57,780
No!

523
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:57,820
It's not a dog!

524
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,060
No!

525
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,700
It's not a dog!

526
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:01,700
No!

527
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:08,660
It's not a dog!

528
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,300
He has a bear standing emoji.

529
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,570
He has a bear standing emoji.

530
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,750
What are we drawing right now?

531
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,370
A turtle.

532
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,750
We're drawing a turtle with sunglasses.

533
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,270
I'm gonna make him really cool though.

534
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,270
I'm gonna make him cool.

535
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,310
I'm gonna make him cool.

536
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,490
I'm gonna make him cool.

537
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,110
I think I have a pinched nerve in my neck.

538
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,470
And I haven't been able to like...

539
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,070
turn my head to the side all week.

540
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,130
So it hurts...

541
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,250
to laugh.

542
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,230
Oh gosh.

543
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,590
Okay.

544
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,490
Okay.

545
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,710
You would think that like...

546
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,950
whore whore whore.

547
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,530
You would think that...

548
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,270
being a ghost like...

549
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,850
you don't have to deal with so many things.

550
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,570
But you know what?

551
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,710
It was so sad when I died, and I was like, yeah, I'm a ghost!

552
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,710
I've escaped everything from the human shackles!

553
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,610
And they were like, about that.

554
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,230
You have everything the same, just as a ghost.

555
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,630
I got ghost taxes.

556
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,930
I've got ghost health problems.

557
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,070
Okay, so a turtle.

558
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,430
Gotta have a big ol' hump.

559
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,430
Like that.

560
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,730
Can we have the bear standing emoji in the next patch, please?

561
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,290
I already deleted it.

562
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,330
The bears get a little quirky.

563
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,880
It's not a bowler hat!

564
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,900
Because turtles have like...

565
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,010
Like that!

566
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,130
That looks like a turtle.

567
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:33,950
So far.

568
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,650
Sunglasses.

569
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,180
And he's like, yeah!

570
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,940
And then he's got his little legs.

571
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,800
But this one...

572
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,040
This one is giving a big ol' thumbs up.

573
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,320
And he has another little leg.

574
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,840
They have four legs.

575
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,640
Oh, wait.

576
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,480
Turtles have tails.

577
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,490
Why is he backwards in his shell?

578
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:16,990
What do you mean?

579
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,150
No, he's not.

580
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,220
Turtle.

581
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:31,820
Turtle.

582
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,380
Oh, he only has three legs.

583
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,760
You're right.

584
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:33,840
Alright.

585
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,820
There we go.

586
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,020
Let's give him an extra one just for good measure.

587
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,160
You know what?

588
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,340
I'll even color it.

589
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,300
I'll even color it.

590
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,920
Let's give him a good ol' green.

591
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,320
There's a turtle.

592
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,580
Oh my god, Squidward!

593
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:56,940
Tortellini!

594
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,860
Thank you for the 50k!

595
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,580
Thank you!

596
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,460
Thank you so much!

597
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,020
Thank you!

598
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,800
Do you think I should have made him bigger or...

599
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,780
Do you think it's okay?

600
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,880
I can make him bigger.

601
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,940
Give me a second.

602
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,920
So you can see him more easily.

603
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,940
You've been turted.

604
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,080
Isn't this... okay.

605
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,460
What's that saying?

606
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,600
They have like a long third leg or whatever?

607
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,260
This guy just has a long... fifth leg.

608
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,760
Just because he's a bit of an abomination doesn't make him... any...

609
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,240
Any... different.

610
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:50,920
Huh?

611
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,300
What do you mean, huh?

612
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,020
Wait.

613
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,220
What did I say wrong?

614
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,640
Wait.

615
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,180
Wait.

616
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,540
Why are you guys reacting like that?

617
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,500
You're scaring me.

618
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,050
The fifth leg.

619
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:11,930
The fifth leg.

620
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,650
Yeah, the fifth leg.

621
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,250
But it's actually him giving a cool thumbs up.

622
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,390
It's a... it's really an arm.

623
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,590
I gave 50 fifties five minutes ago but it didn't happen although the purchase... confirmed?

624
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,490
Wait, what do you mean?

625
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,150
50... fifties?

626
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,430
I saw it!

627
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,810
Wait, you gave even more?

628
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,790
As in... a big arm?

629
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,230
Yeah!

630
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,810
Are you guys seeing the vision now?

631
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,030
For the turtle?

632
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,030
And we'll give him a sandy back.

633
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,190
I'm still in a dream.

634
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,930
Cool turtle.

635
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:12,190
Sorry, I don't know how to do like professional artist things like that could probably make this go faster but I'm doing my best.

636
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,640
Good afternoon.

637
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,300
Good afternoon.

638
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,000
Good afternoon.

639
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,820
Yeah, some people brought it up but yeah, yesterday I was in the relay.

640
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,940
And it was so much fun.

641
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,540
I was so nervous.

642
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,900
Cause I was just like... I have like the transitions and stuff between songs.

643
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,120
And it was like me turning stuff on and making sure things were running properly.

644
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,080
And I was like...

645
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,120
What if I mess up a thing?

646
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,300
But overall it all worked out.

647
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,680
Even though my voice was kind of like...

648
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,600
There you go turtle!

649
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,880
Oh wait!

650
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,640
I must give you one more thing.

651
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,440
You're a little wisp turtle.

652
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,120
Hold on.

653
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,980
You're a wisp turtle.

654
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,690
Thank you!

655
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,890
Thank you, thank you.

656
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,770
Oh wait, I said I was gonna make it bigger.

657
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,250
Hold on.

658
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,470
So this is for your screen cap.

659
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,410
There you go.

660
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,950
There you go.

661
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,210
There you go.

662
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,150
There you go.

663
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:46,930
There you go.

664
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,630
He's like...

665
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,150
Yeah, that's one cool turtle.

666
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,650
That's one cool turtle.

667
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,070
Nice.

668
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,810
Alright, let's see who we get next.

669
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,870
Spin the wheel.

670
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,630
Cowabunga dudes.

671
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,590
Yeah.

672
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,110
Um...

673
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,130
Next is...

674
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,230
Damn Dan.

675
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,330
One thirty...

676
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,130
One?

677
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,030
L?

678
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:22,750
Damn Dan.

679
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,730
Damn Dan!

680
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,990
If you're here, raise your hand.

681
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,050
If not, that's okay too.

682
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,090
Let's see.

683
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,570
Also, you guys...

684
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,630
They have no request.

685
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,910
Oh my gosh.

686
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,390
Let's see.

687
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,330
Damn, Daniel!

688
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,130
What was I gonna say?

689
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,790
Oh, if you... I forgot to say.

690
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,390
If you entered twice, I'll be able to tell.

691
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,410
Because I'll be able to see that you entered twice.

692
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:08,010
Because I go into the Excel sheet that I have of your names.

693
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,730
And I search it.

694
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,250
If you entered twice...

695
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,270
Even if I pick you, I'm not gonna...

696
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,170
I'm not gonna choose you, so...

697
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,650
Yeah, cheaters beware.

698
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,310
Cheaters beware!

699
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,570
In case anybody was worried about that.

700
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,630
Welcome to membership, thank you!

701
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,170
Also, I saw this super chat.

702
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,250
Tomorrow's my birthday!

703
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,410
I'm going to celebrate by staying home and eating cake.

704
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,310
Do you think...

705
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,490
Do you wish me a happy birthday?

706
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,490
Of course, dandelion yellow!

707
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:48,510
Oh my gosh, you sent a yellow super chat just like your name!

708
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,030
Happy... wait.

709
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,500
How do I say happy...

710
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,920
Do I sing happy birthday?

711
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,460
How do I sing happy birthday as an old man?

712
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:22,930
Ha!

713
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,670
Ha!

714
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,710
Happy birthday to you!

715
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:34,670
Happy birthday to you!

716
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,050
Oh gosh,

717
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,410
can I hit this note right now?

718
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,770
Happy...

719
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,310
Birthday!

720
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,470
Dear...

721
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,350
Dandelion yellow!

722
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,370
Happy birthday!

723
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:15,210
I had to work up to it.

724
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,470
Thanks so much!

725
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,350
Draw vans or scuff boats or whatever.

726
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,170
Anything is fine.

727
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,550
Okay, we can do a scuffed boat.

728
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,350
I like it.

729
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,410
I entered twice.

730
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,010
I hope the second would overwrite the first.

731
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,250
Oh!

732
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,110
I appreciate your honesty, Casey Raptor.

733
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,590
I will take that into consideration.

734
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,910
All right, we got scuffed boat.

735
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,550
Let me pull up boat real quick.

736
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,770
Boat to the rock.

737
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,730
Let's see.

738
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,010
Let's see.

739
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,770
Let's see.

740
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,570
Let's see.

741
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,430
Let's see.

742
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,150
Okay, this is a good picture.

743
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,370
Right here.

744
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,270
No.

745
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,670
This picture.

746
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,330
Okay.

747
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,190
Scuffed boat wearing vans.

748
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:00,990
I like it.

749
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,530
I like it.

750
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,050
I like it.

751
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,690
All right.

752
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,690
Where are my...

753
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,370
Where are my...

754
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,650
Okay, boat time.

755
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,250
Let's see.

756
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,470
To draw boat.

757
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,650
I think I'm...

758
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,050
Okay.

759
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,630
Bochy has those little hair bongles.

760
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:23,370
I'm going to give her a square head like her hair bongle, right?

761
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,230
One thing I really like about Bochy too is when her eyes kind of like do this.

762
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,550
Like that, you know?

763
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,270
And then...

764
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,930
What kind of pose should she have?

765
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,910
Oh, one that's like really cool, maybe.

766
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,930
Because she's wearing vans.

767
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:43,850
I love her hands.

768
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:44,450
Uh...

769
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,010
Those aren't yodas.

770
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,670
Those are her hands.

771
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,850
Right?

772
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,150
And...

773
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,770
She's got the vans.

774
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,030
She's got the vans.

775
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,290
She's got the vans.

776
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,190
How do I draw vans?

777
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,210
Hold on.

778
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,530
I'm not feeling it.

779
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:10,910
Cool.

780
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,630
We'll start...hold on.

781
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:12,570
Hmm...

782
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,650
Was that the Phantom of the Opera?

783
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,110
Yeah.

784
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:18,730
Yeah.

785
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,970
I was the Phantom...

786
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:22,950
of the Opera.

787
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,370
Hold on, now I need a picture of vans.

788
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,670
Van shoes.

789
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,990
Oh, we'll give her the checkered ones.

790
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,530
Aren't those really popular?

791
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,230
Oh wait, no, there's a low...

792
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,730
Wait, huh?

793
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,490
Everyone always wears those checkered vans, right?

794
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,170
Checkered.

795
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,310
No.

796
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,790
Hey Mint, my friend Liz is having her birthday this week.

797
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,150
May I have a happy birthday to give to her from you?

798
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,210
Sure!

799
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,390
Hey Liz!

800
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,210
I heard from your friend Cywin that it's your birthday this week!

801
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,510
Happy birthday!

802
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,330
I hope you have the bestest birthday ever and that all your dreams come true!

803
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,610
Ignore the...ignore the person on the screen.

804
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:20,830
Birthday!

805
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,470
Happy!

806
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,310
Happy birthday!

807
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,230
Happy birthday to you, Liz!

808
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:38,690
Okay.

809
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,150
Okay.

810
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:43,110
I'm not trying to erase the birthday or anything, you know?

811
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,490
I'm just uh...okay.

812
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,350
Alright.

813
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:48,830
Bochy the Rock.

814
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,210
She's got...she's got her um...her big sweater on.

815
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,930
And uh...actually let's have her like kind of...actually I think I know an idea for a pose.

816
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,150
She's shrugging.

817
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,850
She's like...

818
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:10,890
Why...why do I exist?

819
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,860
And then...um...we'll give her a wide power stance.

820
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,400
So that she can show off the Vans.

821
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,460
Be like, why are you standing like that?

822
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,340
So you can notice my cool shoes!

823
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,820
And they're the checkered ones.

824
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:35,880
Uh...

825
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,840
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...

826
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,880
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...

827
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,100
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...

828
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,700
Ch -ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...

829
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,580
Like that.

830
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,580
I gotta really fill these in to sell the effect, okay?

831
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,900
She's wearing her Vans, everybody.

832
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,980
She's wearing her Vans.

833
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,400
Okay.

834
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,800
Asserting dominance.

835
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,140
She's shrugging.

836
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,840
She says, why am I alive?

837
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,600
Oh, she's got her little skirt on.

838
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,140
Oh wait, hold on.

839
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,760
Um...hold on.

840
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,780
I gotta erase her...middle.

841
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,580
She's gotta have her skirt on, you guys.

842
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,660
She's not indecent.

843
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,120
That'd be disgusting.

844
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,420
She's not walking around with no pants on, okay?

845
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,820
Vans called.

846
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,940
They want you to stop leaking their new collab that they commissioned from you.

847
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,960
That I didn't sign any NDA!

848
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,680
This is me, reacting to that.

849
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,840
I didn't sign any NDA.

850
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,460
I don't know.

851
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,380
I don't know what you're talking about.

852
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,600
This might be actually a leak of the new season.

853
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,780
Not gonna lie.

854
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,540
This might be a leak of the new season, though.

855
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,200
Of Bochy the Rock.

856
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,340
Watch like an actual Vans Bochy collab comes out.

857
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:20,820
Wait.

858
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,300
I got her hair color wrong.

859
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:24,720
No!

860
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,920
It's more light.

861
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,660
There we go.

862
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,900
There we go.

863
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,840
Hi, Mint.

864
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,100
I was wondering why a cute ghost Mint kept appearing in my recommended.

865
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,620
Realized that my Oshie was back from the dead, kinda.

866
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,780
Glad to have you back, boss.

867
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,760
Thank you!

868
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,720
I'm back, baby.

869
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,380
I'm back.

870
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:56,960
Yeah.

871
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,160
Sometimes I wonder...

872
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,800
I'm like, do people know I'm around?

873
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,680
I wonder if people know that I'm here.

874
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,860
And then we need a blue balls.

875
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,580
Oh, wait.

876
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,120
It's more...

877
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,300
Aqua ball.

878
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,920
And a yellow ball.

879
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,920
Thank you.

880
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,360
Thank you.

881
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,640
We know.

882
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,780
Bochy the block.

883
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,840
Bochy the glock.

884
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,180
Bochy the rock.

885
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,520
Oh, wait.

886
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,900
Bochy the clock.

887
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,700
Bochy the...

888
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,200
Um...

889
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,240
The frock?

890
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,760
That's like a type of clothing, isn't it?

891
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:45,590
Say it?

892
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:46,650
Say what?

893
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:48,870
The smock?

894
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:50,410
The sock?

895
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,170
The padlock?

896
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,070
To continue with the birthday streak, I would be happy if you could say happy birthday to my friend...

897
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,550
Akus.

898
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,310
Did I say that right?

899
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,710
It's not my birthday anytime soon, but can I get a kissy kissy choo choo mwah mwah 9000?

900
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,250
There you go.

901
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,030
Mee-tee surprise.

902
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,330
Yeah.

903
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,670
There you go.

904
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:16,910
Um...

905
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:17,270
Okay.

906
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,650
Ah...

907
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,290
Ah...

908
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:20,970
Ah...

909
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:21,730
Ah...

910
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:21,930
Akus.

911
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:24,950
Akus?

912
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:25,570
Wait.

913
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,770
Am I saying this right?

914
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,130
I can't tell.

915
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,730
I can't tell if I'm saying it right.

916
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:38,510
Okay.

917
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,090
Now we draw in her...

918
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,110
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

919
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,110
Oh, here we go.

920
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:46,370
Hold on.

921
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:46,710
Oh.

922
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,210
One second.

923
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,130
There we go.

924
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:53,030
Oh, it's more like a peachy.

925
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,090
Hold on.

926
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,100
Yeah.

927
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,700
More like this.

928
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,100
Read like Akus.

929
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,280
Ah, okay, okay.

930
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,660
Happy birthday, Akus.

931
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,620
Happy birthday to you.

932
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,080
Happy birthday to you.

933
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,280
Happy birthday, dear Akus.

934
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,080
Happy birthday to you.

935
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,680
Happy birthday!

936
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,300
I hope that worked.

937
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,380
Meow

938
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,280
meow meow meow meow.

939
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,720
And what color is your skirt?

940
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,380
Gray.

941
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:47,820
Gray.

942
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,940
I think it looks like bocce.

943
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:53,900
You guys can tell, right?

944
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,720
You guys can tell this is bocce, right?

945
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,340
You can be like, that's bocce the rock.

946
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,240
Or glock.

947
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,260
Or sock.

948
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,620
Yeah, it's definitely bocce.

949
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,260
Okay, good.

950
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,140
I'm actually gonna... I wonder... oh wait.

951
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,920
Let's see if it looks how it looks with it over the eye.

952
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,660
Oh yeah, I like that better.

953
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,020
Oh, I forgot the color in this part.

954
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,100
Okay, in her vans.

955
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,540
Now, who requested this again?

956
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,360
Damn, damn...

957
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,980
Damn, damn!

958
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:01,070
So,

959
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:05,610
um...

960
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:06,850
13...

961
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:09,610
Like that.

962
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:11,930
Perfect.

963
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,490
I think.

964
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,730
I am satisfied.

965
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:18,830
You better be.

966
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,490
You better be.

967
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:21,810
Here, hold on.

968
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,130
Let me move it down a little bit.

969
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,210
So you don't have to crop it so weird.

970
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:26,990
Oh, wait.

971
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:29,730
There we go.

972
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,470
Let's move it over here.

973
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,750
There you go.

974
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,590
There you go.

975
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:38,530
That's a bocce.

976
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:40,410
That's a bocce time.

977
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,250
Another satisfied customer.

978
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,710
I mean...

979
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,050
Are you a customer?

980
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:46,550
It was free!

981
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,430
The icon was free!

982
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:53,850
It was free!

983
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,770
Yubicorn, thanks for the gift!

984
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,270
Thank you!

985
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,690
Oh, I missed some...

986
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:08,710
I'm sorry, you mentioned earlier about entering twice, but I got confused about just username or actually YouTube username.

987
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:09,850
Sorry about that.

988
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,930
I appreciate your honesty, Rogu.

989
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,290
I appreciate your honesty.

990
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,650
But I think...

991
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,730
I don't see like the ats, you know?

992
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,230
I only see how you appear in chat.

993
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,350
Unless you comment, then I see the ats, but it's usually different names.

994
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,690
ShaggyNerd, thanks for the gift, dude!

995
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:38,110
I was talking earlier about the karaoke yesterday.

996
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,030
I was so happy Maria invited me.

997
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,410
I was like, oh my gosh, where?

998
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:50,590
Babi's Relay.

999
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,130
I was like...

1000
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:53,590
This is me.

1001
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,310
When she invited me.

1002
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:02,170
Even though I got the dates wrong at first because I'm an idiot and I can't read.

1003
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,390
I was like...

1004
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:06,950
That was me.

1005
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,290
I was like...

1006
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:12,110
But...

1007
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:16,390
It was really nice.

1008
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:17,830
Everyone sounded so good.

1009
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:18,930
Oh my gosh.

1010
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:19,890
I was like...

1011
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,410
Wow, everyone is...

1012
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:23,530
Crazy.

1013
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,170
Talented.

1014
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,770
She was ball maxing.

1015
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,370
Those eyes are really well drawn.

1016
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:33,510
Thank you.

1017
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:38,050
And I was like struggling what I wanted to do up until the day of.

1018
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,010
Because I was like...

1019
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,890
If I...

1020
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,710
If I...

1021
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:46,910
Um...

1022
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:52,910
Who is this?

1023
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,330
Who is this?

1024
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:56,250
Sorry,

1025
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,620
I was checking something.

1026
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:02,880
Um...

1027
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,020
I was like...

1028
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,380
If I do a Metal Gear karaoke, I feel like people will be like...

1029
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:07,960
You always do.

1030
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,300
You always do too much Metal Gear.

1031
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:11,860
I'll be like...

1032
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,240
Sorry, I can't help it.

1033
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,460
But also, I was like...

1034
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,640
What if, you know, people don't know who I am.

1035
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,200
They have to know what I'm all about, right?

1036
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,640
Right?

1037
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,600
What?

1038
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,680
You don't do enough Metal Gear karaoke.

1039
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,280
I figured also, I mean like...

1040
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,500
The songs are still good, you know?

1041
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,600
Like, even though it's...

1042
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,400
Like, you don't have to know Metal Gear to enjoy the music, right?

1043
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,360
So...

1044
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,780
I thought it would be okay.

1045
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,340
Alright, I'm spinning again.

1046
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,680
So that's why I decided...

1047
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,440
But it was fine.

1048
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,200
It was so fun.

1049
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,380
And I was...

1050
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,460
I had fun like finding the photos and everything.

1051
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,360
That I wanted to use.

1052
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,780
The next person is....

1053
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,120
Gingerworks!

1054
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,100
Gingerworks!

1055
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,380
Gingerworks!

1056
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,260
Gingerworks!

1057
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,200
Gingerworks!

1058
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,760
Let's see where you are.

1059
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,280
Where you at?

1060
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,160
Gingerworks.

1061
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,220
In my thing.

1062
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,460
Yes sir, I sing Snake Eater on every karaoke.

1063
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,180
No sir, I don't get sick of it.

1064
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:23,480
Gingerworks.

1065
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:31,600
Oh, they asked for an alt-mint outfit or creature-mint.

1066
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,500
Ooh,

1067
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,820
interesting, interesting.

1068
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,860
Creature-mint.

1069
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,720
Well, someone asked earlier about like a spooky one.

1070
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:55,440
But I can't do a spooky one for them and also as the emote.

1071
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:57,740
Let's see.

1072
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,380
How about I just do one like really...

1073
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,540
Okay, hold on.

1074
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:10,990
How do I want to do this?

1075
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,030
La criatura.

1076
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:19,710
How do I want to do this?

1077
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:26,010
I must confess that I requested, but the request is very vague.

1078
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,150
That's fine.

1079
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:30,030
Some people didn't even request, so...

1080
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,490
How do I want to do this?

1081
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:33,350
Hmm...

1082
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,270
Okay, there we go.

1083
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,310
So crop...

1084
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:52,170
Crop this.

1085
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,830
Not very straight though.

1086
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:58,970
It was a great karaoke, but can we have something other than tree frog for dinner?

1087
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,550
I'm told chicken is good.

1088
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:01,670
No!

1089
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:05,210
Tree frog tastes just like chicken, don't you know?

1090
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,610
You know, everything that's a different kind of meat tastes just like chicken.

1091
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,130
According to the world.

1092
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,250
Okay.

1093
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,950
What's wrong with me?

1094
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,320
This one needs my utmost attention.

1095
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,200
And concentration.

1096
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:58,980
Okay?

1097
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,320
Give me one moment.

1098
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:29,430
Does this even look like me anymore?

1099
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:35,630
Does this even look like me anymore?

1100
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:37,230
Does this even look like me anymore?

1101
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,770
It's okay.

1102
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,610
Once I do the hair, it will...

1103
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,450
Thank you!

1104
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:45,730
Superliminal.

1105
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:47,370
Ghost made is moi.

1106
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:48,730
Made of ectoplasm.

1107
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,230
Oh, sorry.

1108
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:49,830
M-O-E.

1109
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,770
I don't see the difference.

1110
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,550
Oh, do I need a little tongue out?

1111
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:54,110
Maybe?

1112
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,200
Now I'm reaching...

1113
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,460
Whoops.

1114
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:02,900
Redo.

1115
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,280
Have to have that final stroke.

1116
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,780
I didn't know what you meant by request.

1117
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,000
So I just asked you to have a nice day.

1118
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,220
If I get pulled, can I request in a super chat?

1119
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:12,700
Of course!

1120
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,000
You don't even have to super chat.

1121
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,840
Remember when I said crop there?

1122
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:21,560
I lied.

1123
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,720
Because I'm coming out of your screen.

1124
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,040
Coming out of your screen.

1125
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,160
Open up.

1126
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,680
Yes, Jack!

1127
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:35,020
Johnny!

1128
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,600
Oh my gosh, I think I've been calling my new cat Johnny instead of Paz lately.

1129
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:41,780
She...

1130
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,200
She is so...

1131
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:46,520
smelly.

1132
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,640
She is so stinky.

1133
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:49,960
Like...

1134
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,720
Oh my gosh.

1135
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:53,980
Um...

1136
00:55:53,980 --> 00:56:05,400
Oh yeah, I think I said like on stream how I thought I was gonna have to take her to the vet because she was just she was just spewing poop everywhere at one point.

1137
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,280
And...

1138
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,160
Every time she goes to the bathroom, she just blows up the maid cafe.

1139
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,480
It is like a...

1140
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,740
It is just a bomb goes off.

1141
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,000
And like...

1142
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,120
Actually well, I was...

1143
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:20,900
Um...

1144
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,380
I was...

1145
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,820
I was...

1146
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,600
Cleaning and um...

1147
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,060
I was like Oh my gosh, someone else...

1148
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,480
I was like, oh no!

1149
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,540
Johnny went to the bathroom again.

1150
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,740
It smells so bad.

1151
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,700
And then, you know who I see walk out from the litter box?

1152
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,360
Butaro.

1153
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,200
He was like...

1154
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,100
I am the reigning stink champ.

1155
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:52,060
And I will not let an outsider take my title.

1156
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,420
He is the reigning champion.

1157
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:54,520
He is the reigning champion.

1158
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,000
So uh...

1159
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,940
Yeah, see this looks more like me now.

1160
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,220
Yeah,

1161
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:05,700
see this looks more like me now.

1162
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,860
Then we will do the X.

1163
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,020
We will do that later though.

1164
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:08,880
Pause.

1165
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,860
Blow something up.

1166
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,860
Seems in character.

1167
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,060
Oof.

1168
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:30,050
Oof.

1169
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:30,710
Hahaha.

1170
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,070
Oof.

1171
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:39,740
But yeah.

1172
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,240
So uh...

1173
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,680
That's what happened.

1174
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,440
Um... wait a second.

1175
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:48,820
Oh yeah, okay.

1176
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,030
Kinda crazy.

1177
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:56,710
I think she has IBS.

1178
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:01,990
Cause okay, when I first brought her home I noticed, I was like, yeah she's a little smelly.

1179
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:03,290
And then like...

1180
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:04,750
She would be around.

1181
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,370
My cat would be around.

1182
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,110
And like...

1183
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,610
She was just farting like crazy.

1184
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,530
And even...

1185
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,230
And I was like, maybe she's nervous.

1186
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,550
Because you know, she just got brought to a new home.

1187
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:23,730
But even now...

1188
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,470
She just...

1189
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:28,350
She just farts all the time.

1190
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:32,290
She'll... I'll pick her up and she farts.

1191
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:34,930
And I...

1192
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:38,530
I'll pet her and if she gets too comfortable she farts.

1193
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,570
She's so...

1194
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,210
She's so smelly.

1195
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,310
Oh my god.

1196
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,070
She's actually...

1197
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:52,050
She's actually so smelly.

1198
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:55,650
And like...

1199
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:58,570
They never brought that up when I was like...

1200
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:02,090
When I was like, hey is there anything I should know about her?

1201
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:03,230
No.

1202
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:06,570
They didn't say anything like, oh she's a smelly machine.

1203
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:07,890
No.

1204
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,150
They were just like, no.

1205
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:10,430
She's totally fine.

1206
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:11,550
Everything's good.

1207
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:16,330
And it's not like I was feeding her like new food at that point.

1208
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,170
It was still her old food.

1209
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:20,470
Um...

1210
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,490
She just was...

1211
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:24,570
Maybe it's the food itself.

1212
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:25,310
Maybe...

1213
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:31,690
Would you say they gaslighted you?

1214
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:32,370
Okay.

1215
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:33,830
Also a little bit.

1216
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:35,490
Because...

1217
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,010
When I got her, like...

1218
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,430
They were like, oh my gosh.

1219
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:41,090
You just adopted the best cat ever.

1220
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:42,050
She's so sweet.

1221
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:43,270
She's so nice.

1222
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,410
She's so... Oh my gosh.

1223
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,330
Everything about her.

1224
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:50,210
She's like this wonderful purring from the other end.

1225
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:53,230
Better out than in.

1226
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,170
I always say.

1227
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:56,710
Um...

1228
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:58,870
But uh...

1229
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,010
But um...

1230
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:01,630
...

1231
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:02,410
...

1232
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:05,610
Her...

1233
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,190
What the hell?

1234
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,150
Oh god...

1235
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:26,030
I...

1236
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,480
Oh god..

1237
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,060
Okay...

1238
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,460
Anyway what was I saying?

1239
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,840
Oh they were like, she's so sweet.

1240
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,000
She's a lap cat.

1241
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,060
She does this.

1242
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,560
She's just the sweetest girl ever.

1243
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,240
And I was like, Yippee!

1244
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,760
I've always wanted a lap cat.

1245
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,300
I was so excited.

1246
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,300
She has not laid in my lap once.

1247
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,100
Actually, it was maybe false advertising.

1248
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,160
I was like, what?

1249
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:10,540
Okay.

1250
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,400
I was like, well, you know, she's still nervous.

1251
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,040
Like, she'll get in my lap eventually.

1252
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,220
Not even once.

1253
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,540
She hasn't even laid in the bed with me when I'm going to sleep.

1254
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:32,120
I think... I was like, why is your advertiser the ultimate lap cat?

1255
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,300
And I mean, she's very sweet.

1256
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:33,940
Don't get me wrong.

1257
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,060
Like, she's so, so nice.

1258
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,300
And like, she...

1259
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,240
Maybe it was lab cat.

1260
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,660
It's probably better, probably.

1261
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,280
She just lays in my lap and farts the whole time.

1262
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,160
You want her farting in your lap.

1263
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,260
I want her... I want her...

1264
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,880
Well, recently, if I'm on the couch, she has started like...

1265
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,860
She has started laying next to me.

1266
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:01,180
So, maybe it just takes her a little bit of extra time or something.

1267
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:01,780
I don't know.

1268
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:02,920
But...

1269
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,280
But, yeah.

1270
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,080
Now it looks like me.

1271
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,720
Okay, what was the name by...

1272
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:13,600
Gingerworks.

1273
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,000
That's right.

1274
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,560
Wait, what the hell?

1275
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:20,840
What happened to the...

1276
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:22,380
Hardness.

1277
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,080
There we go.

1278
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:24,480
Oh, I did that.

1279
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,180
There you go.

1280
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,780
So, hopefully...

1281
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,380
And like, for the first time...

1282
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,480
Last night...

1283
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:49,980
She...

1284
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:50,720
She...

1285
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,620
Did not...

1286
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,640
Oh, I forgot the...

1287
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,020
She did not sleep with me...

1288
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,080
In my bed.

1289
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,240
But she stayed in the room.

1290
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,340
In my...

1291
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,200
In my room.

1292
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,220
So...

1293
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,100
You know...

1294
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,140
She is eventually getting there.

1295
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,120
I think a little bit.

1296
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,480
I forgot my eyelashes.

1297
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,440
I forgot to have eyelashes.

1298
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,340
Oops.

1299
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:26,860
Oops.

1300
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,640
Oops.

1301
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,340
Oh, and blushing.

1302
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,390
There you go.

1303
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:47,510
I had problems with my big nasty boy when I got him.

1304
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:48,670
Crazy running, jumping, etc.

1305
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,070
Turns out the rescue just copy-pasted all cat descriptions?

1306
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:52,550
Maybe I should check that out.

1307
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:58,830
They were like crying though at the pet store.

1308
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:04,030
They were like, they were like, oh my gosh, we're going to miss you, Paz.

1309
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,230
Oh my god, what?

1310
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,290
And I was like, wow, she's so beloved.

1311
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:11,530
She's so sweet.

1312
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:17,550
But, um, I hope that they didn't just copy and paste it.

1313
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:19,530
I hope not.

1314
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:22,070
Welcome to membership, thank you!

1315
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:24,050
Thank you, thank you!

1316
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:26,770
Anyway.

1317
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,130
I hope not.

1318
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,750
Okay, let's do another one.

1319
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:46,860
Tears of joy to be rid of the stick you were crying because they can finally breathe.

1320
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,080
The winner is...

1321
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,260
Ta-da!

1322
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,960
Venti does things!

1323
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,500
Venti, come on down!

1324
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:16,100
Make the watermelon extra round and perhaps give the cat a cowboy hat if possible.

1325
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:16,980
Thank you!

1326
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:21,140
Well, I don't know what your profile picture is.

1327
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:30,340
So, uh, they weren't crying, their ears, their eyes weren't watering because they just cleaned her litter.

1328
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,160
Okay, wait, we have no context for your picture.

1329
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,760
Except that there is a watermelon and a cat.

1330
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:43,760
So, hold on.

1331
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,100
Um...

1332
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,160
Uh...

1333
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:49,720
Uh...

1334
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:54,540
Make the watermelon extra round and give the cat a cowboy hat if possible.

1335
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:55,500
Okay.

1336
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:02,240
Watermelon cat.

1337
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,000
Watermelon cat with a hat.

1338
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,900
What if I Google, or not Google, if I search them on YouTube.

1339
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:08,620
Let's see.

1340
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,560
If anything comes up.

1341
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1342
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,860
Don't search their...

1343
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:19,400
Oh, my God.

1344
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:20,680
Don't search their username.

1345
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:24,200
I didn't know that Venti was a character from Genshin Impact.

1346
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,560
And, um...

1347
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,180
Does things is, like, really vague.

1348
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,920
And, like...

1349
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,640
Oh, my God.

1350
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,840
Oh, my God.

1351
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,700
Oh, my God.

1352
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:37,160
Oh, my God.

1353
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:37,900
Oh, my God.

1354
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:38,460
Oh, my God.

1355
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,150
Oh, my God.

1356
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:43,550
I didn't know.

1357
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:47,230
Watermelon cat.

1358
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:48,010
Let's go.

1359
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:51,330
Okay.

1360
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:56,550
So, we're gonna make a really round, thick watermelon.

1361
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:00,350
No.

1362
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:04,850
Yeah, that works.

1363
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:06,690
No.

1364
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:09,870
That works.

1365
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:11,630
That works.

1366
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:15,590
Hmm.

1367
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:19,510
Look, can you guys see me draw a heart?

1368
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:22,210
Isn't that...

1369
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:22,290
Oh.

1370
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:25,390
Hold on, let me try to...

1371
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:29,050
Let me actually, let me actually watch what I'm drawing.

1372
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:29,670
Hold on.

1373
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:33,990
Could you see it with my hand?

1374
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,990
Could you see it with my hand?

1375
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:43,790
With the thing?

1376
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:50,730
Okay, so the cat... we're gonna have him like sticking his head out here.

1377
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:57,270
Why is drawing a circle so hard?

1378
01:07:59,090 --> 01:07:59,930
Yeah, you could.

1379
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:18,790
He's happy to be there.

1380
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:21,270
He's happy to be there.

1381
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:28,310
Wait.

1382
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,530
Do you think he needs the ears or...

1383
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,370
I feel like I'm drawing something from Battle Cats.

1384
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:42,850
Nah, I like it better like this.

1385
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:43,610
Actually, hold on.

1386
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:51,210
There we go.

1387
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,020
I made him a little...

1388
01:08:58,020 --> 01:08:58,340
A little insane.

1389
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,320
Yeah, whatever.

1390
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,200
Nice.

1391
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,220
Okay, so the watermelon is really chunky.

1392
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,400
And then a cowboy hat is like...

1393
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:13,660
A tarnation.

1394
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,220
Just like that.

1395
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:22,740
Wait, how do I... Actually, I don't know what a cowboy hat looks like at all.

1396
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:25,560
Cowboy...

1397
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,360
Cowboy hat.

1398
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,440
Okay, hold on.

1399
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,960
Oh, yeah, yep.

1400
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,400
Getting some fine cowboys.

1401
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,820
I'm a cowboy.

1402
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,980
I'm a cow...

1403
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,900
Wait, there's cowboys, but where are the cowmen?

1404
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,420
I'm a cowman.

1405
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:54,960
I'm a cowman.

1406
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,400
I'm a cowman.

1407
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:58,120
I'm a cowman.

1408
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,580
I'm a cowman.

1409
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,420
I'm a cowman.

1410
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,400
Meowdy.

1411
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,260
I don't know what the perspective is on this thing.

1412
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,340
I guess that works.

1413
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,600
Actually, hold on.

1414
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,420
I'm a cowman.

1415
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,700
That's what I be asking every day.

1416
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,340
Hi, Maya!

1417
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:25,540
That's what I be asking every day.

1418
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:25,540
Hi, Maya!

1419
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,960
I'm a cowman.

1420
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,640
On this cowland.

1421
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,260
Only boys in these parts.

1422
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,440
But I'm a cowman.

1423
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,800
I'm a lone cow...

1424
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,920
A lone star.

1425
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,420
Oh, we'll give him a star.

1426
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,100
We'll give him...

1427
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,420
We'll give him a star.

1428
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,640
I don't know if this works.

1429
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,520
It kind of looks more like a fedora.

1430
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,520
But I think it will have to do.

1431
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,280
Hi, wispss...

1432
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,560
It looks like a fedora.

1433
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,700
It's okay, it's okay.

1434
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:16,860
It's okay, it's okay.

1435
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:17,980
I wonder if I do this.

1436
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,820
If I have the ears sticking out, here.

1437
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,500
If I have the ears sticking out, here.

1438
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,360
I like him looking more like a potato, you know.

1439
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,180
I kind of like that better.

1440
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,960
All right, for the watermelon colors, we needed like a dark...

1441
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,620
We need like a... not a neon green, like a...

1442
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:45,560
That'll do.

1443
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:03,590
Also, you guys, what color should the cat be?

1444
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,390
What kind of colored cat should it be?

1445
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:06,770
Howdy, m'lady.

1446
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:11,190
This guy is a cow man, truly.

1447
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:13,750
What color cat should it be?

1448
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:16,890
Orange.

1449
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:22,920
Orange cat.

1450
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:31,880
I always hear that orange cats are crazy, but I had an orange cat when I was a kid, and he wasn't that crazy, actually.

1451
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,260
Okay, those should be good colors.

1452
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,300
How am I supposed to do this, actually?

1453
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,420
I did not think this through.

1454
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,560
I did not think this through at all.

1455
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,380
I did not think this through at all.

1456
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:56,480
Mine is... No, my orange cat was actually the most chill cat I have ever had.

1457
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,320
He was so chill.

1458
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:02,100
He was so sweet, but he did have a problem.

1459
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:07,260
Like, I don't let my cats outside anymore, but when I, you know...

1460
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,620
My family before, they didn't really care.

1461
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,360
And... Oh, I didn't mean to zoom in.

1462
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:15,240
There we go.

1463
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:19,500
And...

1464
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:26,460
And... But he would go to the neighbor's houses, and he would, like, walk.

1465
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,680
He knew how to open doors.

1466
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,080
He was a very smart cat.

1467
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,760
Like, if the door had a handle, he would open it up.

1468
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,380
And so, because of that, he...

1469
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:41,100
He would go to the neighbor's houses and, like, let himself in.

1470
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:48,860
And would just, like... The neighbors would sometimes call and be like, wait, I'm such an idiot.

1471
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,420
Hold on.

1472
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm just gonna color in the whole thing, and then we'll do the other stripes.

1473
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,060
Why am I... Work smarter, not harder, everybody.

1474
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:01,980
But, um...

1475
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:05,580
See, I'm stupid.

1476
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:06,520
I don't know how to do this.

1477
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,340
Um... But, yeah.

1478
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:19,520
And then, um... Like, during dinner, he would just kind of sit at the table, and he wouldn't beg for food.

1479
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,000
Like, he didn't try to climb on the table or anything.

1480
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:27,220
Like, we would save him a seat at the dinner table, because you... He... Ouch, I just bit my tongue.

1481
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,040
Oh...

1482
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,100
I want to put my...

1483
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,560
I want to put my...

1484
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,020
I want to put my...

1485
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:37,560
I want to put my...

1486
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:37,880
Oh my god.

1487
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:41,640
Yeah,

1488
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:51,120
he was very polite I mean, there was one time he pooped in my bed when I was sleeping.

1489
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,280
But other than that, he was really respectful.

1490
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:58,960
And he was a good guy.

1491
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:12,530
Yeah, I think that's when he was going senile.

1492
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:15,330
He thought my bed was a litter box.

1493
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:15,930
And...

1494
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:21,970
I remember like... I remember him like... trying to...

1495
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:26,190
You know how when cats like... they like... scoop with their paws?

1496
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,930
I thought he was trying to get comfy.

1497
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,330
I was like, what are you doing little guy?

1498
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,830
And then he turned around and just took a big ol' dupe of her.

1499
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:36,850
I was like in my bed while I was...

1500
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,010
I was like you know...

1501
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:42,970
Honest mistake, truly.

1502
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:45,270
Why is he wearing a snake hat?

1503
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:47,190
Snake that ate an elephant.

1504
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:48,590
Wait, what?

1505
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,630
What are you talking about?

1506
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,340
That's not very polite.

1507
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,240
Yeah, that part was not very polite.

1508
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,920
That part kind of sucked.

1509
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,660
I was like, why would you...

1510
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,020
Why would you do that?

1511
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,000
I think he was kind of losing it.

1512
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,300
Oh no, you guys.

1513
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,580
I don't know if I've ever told you guys about my grandma.

1514
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,340
But I'm gonna go see her soon.

1515
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,300
I'm going to go see my grandma soon.

1516
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,020
I haven't seen her in a long while.

1517
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,660
She might not even remember me.

1518
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,280
But...

1519
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,380
We'll see.

1520
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,140
I can't believe Mint just doxxed herself to be Johnny Depp.

1521
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:38,680
What do you mean?

1522
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,460
Wait, did he poop in a bed like that?

1523
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,880
Who is this wild mustache man who replaced Mint?

1524
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,440
What are you talking about?

1525
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,420
I'm the mysterious traveler.

1526
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,020
I'm a mysterious artician.

1527
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,160
Why is it so hard making this a watermelon?

1528
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,220
Holy cow.

1529
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:09,580
I think I'm...

1530
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:13,000
I think I don't know how to do anything.

1531
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:16,620
Is that a seal?

1532
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,400
No, it's a cat.

1533
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:21,800
So...

1534
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,860
Sooo...

1535
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,460
Okay.

1536
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,120
I got this though.

1537
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,400
I can color it in.

1538
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,720
I can color it in.

1539
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,960
I can make it nice.

1540
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,160
I'm a simp.

1541
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,980
The images extension can show you profile pictures.

1542
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:43,120
If you have it, hover over an image.

1543
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:47,140
It shows you a big version for example for users in chat.

1544
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:48,660
Chat.

1545
01:17:57,370 --> 01:18:01,890
Isn't it more exciting to kind of get... I mean, you're not paying for it.

1546
01:18:04,730 --> 01:18:06,790
Take what you can get, I suppose.

1547
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:13,290
Isn't it more exciting if you're like, what is she going to draw me?

1548
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,430
That's why I asked if you wanted any requests.

1549
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:20,970
Use bucket?

1550
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:22,650
Will it work?

1551
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,590
Oh.

1552
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:25,590
It will work here?

1553
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,060
Oh.

1554
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,540
It doesn't work.

1555
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,320
Wait, hold on.

1556
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,140
Maybe here.

1557
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,220
Let's try again.

1558
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:41,980
It doesn't work.

1559
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,600
I can't use bucket.

1560
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,320
It doesn't work.

1561
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,280
It doesn't work!

1562
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,280
I have to color it all in by hand!

1563
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,580
I can't use bucket.

1564
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:53,780
I can't.

1565
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,480
I can't use bucket.

1566
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,100
Brush size, maybe.

1567
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:01,940
No, it's okay.

1568
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,320
You guys, calm down.

1569
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,720
Why are you in such a rush, huh?

1570
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,660
I like coloring in the lines.

1571
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:12,360
I like it.

1572
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,740
It's making me feel a little bit... actually too relaxed.

1573
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:18,100
I should have taken a nap before this stream because I was like...

1574
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,280
Oh no!

1575
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:19,820
I'm yawning!

1576
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:24,200
I am drinking coffee right now, but I'm still so sleepy.

1577
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:26,860
Sleepy ghost.

1578
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:36,480
Okay.

1579
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,080
Okay, orange cat time.

1580
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,280
Tell Amaya...

1581
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,160
Y'all backseating artisting Picasso?

1582
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,520
Yeah!

1583
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,200
Stop backseating me!

1584
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:07,940
Stop it!

1585
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:10,140
This is the process.

1586
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,160
It must be done by hand.

1587
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,160
Or not at all.

1588
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,200
Actually, I wonder if I can use bucket here.

1589
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,080
Yippee!

1590
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:20,420
Yippee!

1591
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,220
I mean, it can be done by bucket sometimes.

1592
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:36,860
Yay!

1593
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,900
Oh yes, the process.

1594
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,040
Screw the process!

1595
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,060
A little pink nose like that.

1596
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,000
And then...

1597
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,200
Give this...

1598
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,220
Give this little cow cat...

1599
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,020
A nice...

1600
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,820
Brown fedora.

1601
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,560
No, this is not a fedora.

1602
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:01,140
This is a cowboy hat.

1603
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,220
What kind of fedora would be brown?

1604
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:05,840
Thanks, RayMac.

1605
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,880
There will literally be a day...

1606
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,480
Oh!

1607
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:12,420
There will literally never be a day I complain about too much Mint Metal Gear karaoke.

1608
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:13,360
Ah!

1609
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,020
I'm glad.

1610
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:15,780
Sorry.

1611
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,540
Sorry, all the donuts are backed up.

1612
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,240
They're coming in eventually.

1613
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,620
That was from a while ago.

1614
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:25,500
Yeah...

1615
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,340
That's okay.

1616
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,520
I still saw it.

1617
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,060
I'm trying to get the color.

1618
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,960
Trying to get the perfect...

1619
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,500
This guy is a deputy.

1620
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,700
He is running this town.

1621
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,420
He is running this town.

1622
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,300
I hope you like it.

1623
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,100
I hope you like your...

1624
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:53,460
Oh, wait!

1625
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:53,740
Sorry.

1626
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,660
I have to write your name too.

1627
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,620
Venti does things.

1628
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,320
But don't look that up.

1629
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:00,800
Because...

1630
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,240
Apparently, Venti is doing things.

1631
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:18,310
But for the karaoke...

1632
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,510
It's funny because I said like...

1633
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:22,170
I'm not going to do karaoke.

1634
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:22,670
Sorry.

1635
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:23,810
I'm like tilting my head.

1636
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:24,710
Venti does...

1637
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:26,270
Oh, gosh.

1638
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:27,510
Okay.

1639
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,150
This is so far so good.

1640
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:32,850
Oh, nice.

1641
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:35,070
I was like...

1642
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:38,230
Oh, I'm not going to do another karaoke for a while because I...

1643
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:40,530
Because I...

1644
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,350
My voice, my throat has not been so good.

1645
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:46,910
And then I realized that the date for...

1646
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:49,610
I mixed the date up for this karaoke.

1647
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:50,330
I was like...

1648
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:51,350
Oopsie.

1649
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,770
Oopsie.

1650
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:52,150
Oopsie.

1651
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:56,630
What's going on?

1652
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:57,930
So, but it was only 20 minutes.

1653
01:22:58,130 --> 01:22:59,550
And I just picked really hard songs.

1654
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:02,150
You are truly an artistic genius and the cutest.

1655
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,950
Stop!

1656
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:09,330
My cat escaped from me while I was watching your stream.

1657
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,130
And I had to take a two mile walk to get back...

1658
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:12,190
Get him back home.

1659
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,350
But I'm glad I was able to catch him and still have time for...

1660
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:16,050
Is your cat okay?

1661
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:16,910
Are you okay?

1662
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:18,510
Sounds kind of traumatic.

1663
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:20,270
Anyways, thank you, Venti.

1664
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:22,050
I hope you enjoy your...

1665
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:38,600
I don't know, I really like... I have so much fun doing karaoke though.

1666
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:42,360
And it's like so easy if I'm just like, I don't know what I want to do today.

1667
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,300
Karaoke, it's so easy.

1668
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:51,000
Our next person is...

1669
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,080
Reverie Bunny!

1670
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,120
Thank you!

1671
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,220
Thank you, thank you!

1672
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,800
Melon, you have to leave now.

1673
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,160
Happy Cinco de Meow-o!

1674
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,900
Oh my gosh, it is!

1675
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,200
Happy Cinco de Mayo, everybody.

1676
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:11,860
A Catermelon?

1677
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,640
Perry the Catermelon?

1678
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:15,580
No...

1679
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,840
Saki Saki!

1680
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,920
Thank you for the mustache, thank you!

1681
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,440
Reverie Bunny.

1682
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:25,380
Reverie Bunny.

1683
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,560
My profile pic with mint-made headband.

1684
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,240
Scribble, scrabble.

1685
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,640
Oh, I see you!

1686
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,480
If you can't draw my profile picture, just draw a mochi bunny with your headband.

1687
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,000
Thanks!

1688
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,480
A mochi bunny!

1689
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:45,140
I can do that.

1690
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,120
I can do that.

1691
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:47,920
Mochi bunny.

1692
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,860
Mochi bunny, mochi bunny.

1693
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,460
I just... it's so similar.

1694
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,200
Thank you, thank you!

1695
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:54,720
Wait.

1696
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,800
Mochi bunny are like...

1697
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:04,720
The little ones with the red eyes, right?

1698
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:09,000
And then they have...

1699
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,160
They have the green, right?

1700
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,720
Am I thinking of the correct thing?

1701
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,040
Yeah?

1702
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:19,680
Okay, okay.

1703
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,220
This one's actually not cursed at all.

1704
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,820
This one's very cute, everybody.

1705
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:32,240
Stream too comfy, making me want to go to...

1706
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:34,020
Me too.

1707
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:38,040
I'll give him a little smile though, is that okay?

1708
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,300
Mmm, mochi.

1709
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:43,060
Oh my gosh, there was like... I think it was...

1710
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,000
I think it was...

1711
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:48,660
Family Mart?

1712
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:49,900
Or 7-Eleven?

1713
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,680
That I got some so good mochi.

1714
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:54,840
It was so soft.

1715
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,460
Make him evil?

1716
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,860
It was so soft and so delicious and...

1717
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:11,680
Oh, here I'll give him a little...

1718
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,680
Little triangle.

1719
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,280
Itai kakushi.

1720
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,600
And how do I want to make the headband?

1721
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:20,660
Hmm...

1722
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:22,380
Hmm...

1723
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,780
Do I want to make it like here?

1724
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,740
Or do I want to make it here?

1725
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:31,220
Me?

1726
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,620
Can I gotcha the alert sound?

1727
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,720
And when the alert will show up in one dono...

1728
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:37,580
Thank you!

1729
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:42,700
Too bad, too bad, too bad.

1730
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,980
Did you see... did you... oh.

1731
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,580
I did, yes.

1732
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:49,860
Yes!

1733
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,260
I thought it was very cute.

1734
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:59,180
But I don't know why you would bring up that person.

1735
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:01,060
I've never talked about them before.

1736
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,740
Oh wait, let's see.

1737
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,740
What is that little growth coming from your head?

1738
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:17,180
My hair?

1739
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:25,570
This... this is hair!

1740
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,290
You've never seen hair before?

1741
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:30,150
Well that's a ribbon.

1742
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:32,810
This is hair!

1743
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,550
It's terminal.

1744
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:37,150
This is hair.

1745
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:42,760
The triangle?

1746
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,620
That?

1747
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,100
It's just what ghosts wear.

1748
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,000
It's everywhere.

1749
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:58,540
And it's terminal.

1750
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,200
I've seen people say like it's half a cat ear.

1751
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:12,380
And I kind of like that theory too.

1752
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,680
Because I'm like dang.

1753
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,660
I'm like so cool.

1754
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,360
I lost half my ear.

1755
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,140
Like I lost one of my ears.

1756
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,460
I only have one cat ear.

1757
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,920
What if I get a cat ear?

1758
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,120
What if I get cat ears?

1759
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,960
Will it look weird?

1760
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:26,500
I wonder.

1761
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:28,380
You're absurd.

1762
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,500
Firefly.

1763
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:31,580
Oh, six.

1764
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:32,100
Oh...

1765
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:35,520
Six.

1766
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,520
OMG, Venom punished me.

1767
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,320
I think I'm gonna do the headband.

1768
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:44,640
This way.

1769
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,400
I don't know how to do...

1770
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,200
I'm so sorry.

1771
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:54,340
I'm so sorry, Bunny.

1772
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:55,580
I don't know how to do...

1773
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,900
I don't know how to do ruffles.

1774
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:02,000
That looks close enough though, right?

1775
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,360
Looks close enough maybe.

1776
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,850
You can kind of tell, right?

1777
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:14,230
Here, I'll even do...

1778
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:15,690
I'll even do the blue.

1779
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:27,370
Perfecto?

1780
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:29,410
You think so?

1781
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:31,950
Perfecto for real?

1782
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:35,030
And then I write your name.

1783
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,430
Just needs vertical lines.

1784
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:37,950
Okay.

1785
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:39,830
I trust your judgment.

1786
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:47,110
Wish me luck.

1787
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:55,210
Gracias.

1788
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:13,730
Che вы у dois.

1789
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:14,390
A touch cake will taste the same.

1790
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:18,090
To become your love.

1791
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:21,210
A bread will taste the same.

1792
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:21,530
A little extra cash from your bank.

1793
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:22,010
Hey, I know I'm in for trouble now.

1794
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:22,470
I still have in here what I want to do.

1795
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:22,970
Are you good enough?

1796
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:23,430
Do you want to draw me next?

1797
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:24,090
Sure!

1798
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:26,430
I'll draw you.

1799
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:47,320
You.

1800
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:51,520
You.

1801
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,040
You.

1802
01:30:58,780 --> 01:30:59,400
You.

1803
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,700
You.

1804
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:05,380
You.

1805
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:32,900
Yeah, I drew that really good, right?

1806
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:35,000
I know.

1807
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:37,960
You.

1808
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:48,060
Do you guys know that one face?

1809
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:48,560
Hold on.

1810
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:04,600
Okay, ignore the top.

1811
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,220
Ignore the top text, but...

1812
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:10,660
This is the only picture that I could find that wasn't a gif, okay?

1813
01:32:10,740 --> 01:32:12,240
So just ignore the top text.

1814
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,060
So...

1815
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,320
I think it's this face.

1816
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:27,060
Okay, every time... Okay, you want to see me make this face?

1817
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:27,440
Hold on.

1818
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:31,010
Hold on.

1819
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,460
Oh, my mustache.

1820
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,240
My mustache, you look like shit.

1821
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:41,780
Okay.

1822
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,300
Don't I look the same?

1823
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,220
I feel like my eyes are going...

1824
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,840
Do I look the same as Shinji?

1825
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,440
My eyes are too large?

1826
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:27,080
But don't my eyes kind of look like they go in different directions?

1827
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,910
No, it's not me that fart unleashed.

1828
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:37,310
It's you.

1829
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:38,710
See, there's the hand pointing.

1830
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:40,710
You're a shit.

1831
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:44,530
Minto get in the robot!

1832
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:55,630
Lizard eyes.

1833
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:57,450
It's me.

1834
01:33:57,610 --> 01:33:58,510
Frog eyes.

1835
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:00,730
Hold on, let me see if I can blink one at a time.

1836
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:03,170
Did I do it?

1837
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,480
Am I smaller?

1838
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,840
Why is my mustache so big now?

1839
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,060
Hold on.

1840
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:45,040
There we go.

1841
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:48,640
Why is my mustache so much bigger?

1842
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,100
Huh?

1843
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:56,330
I'm Cherino?

1844
01:34:58,830 --> 01:34:59,430
Yes.

1845
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:00,630
I am the leader.

1846
01:35:02,370 --> 01:35:04,070
And where's my...

1847
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:08,230
Why do I feel so different?

1848
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:08,850
What happened?

1849
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:10,930
What happened to me?

1850
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:11,950
Okay.

1851
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,730
My hand is still here.

1852
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:16,830
Alrighty.

1853
01:35:17,490 --> 01:35:18,290
Let's see.

1854
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:18,870
Oh.

1855
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:22,270
This one is for...

1856
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:29,330
I'm gonna pick someone's name out of the chat.

1857
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:30,930
And this one can be your profile picture.

1858
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,390
And I'll even write your name on it.

1859
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:37,770
I'm gonna open my eyes and the first name that I see will be for you.

1860
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:38,950
Ready?

1861
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:42,230
Three...

1862
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:44,010
Two...

1863
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:45,810
One...

1864
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:47,750
Oh my gosh.

1865
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:48,690
It's going too fast.

1866
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:49,270
Oh god.

1867
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:49,650
Okay.

1868
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:49,870
Hold on.

1869
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:50,430
One more time.

1870
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:50,890
One more time.

1871
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:51,270
One more time.

1872
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:52,830
Three...

1873
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:54,770
Two...

1874
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:56,290
One...

1875
01:35:57,970 --> 01:35:58,770
I see...

1876
01:36:00,410 --> 01:36:01,210
Misha Gucci.

1877
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:05,110
Oh.

1878
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:16,990
There you go.

1879
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:19,050
All yours.

1880
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:19,270
Of course.

1881
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:25,730
There you go.

1882
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:26,890
Thanks for the super chat.

1883
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:31,030
Misha Gucci.

1884
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:32,510
Omedetou.

1885
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:34,650
Wherever you are.

1886
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:37,390
Omedetou with your toes.

1887
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:42,740
Nice.

1888
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:48,060
I wanna see if they come back with this as their...

1889
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,220
As their profile picture.

1890
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:51,480
I'm looking.

1891
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:53,020
I'm waiting.

1892
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:54,760
I'm waiting.

1893
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:56,400
Best piece yet?

1894
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:57,640
What do you mean by that?

1895
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:01,760
I mean this was made with the most love maybe.

1896
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:02,560
Oh wait.

1897
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,140
Oh wait.

1898
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,040
I don't want it to be me.

1899
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:21,740
Wait a second.

1900
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:22,740
I should have had the...

1901
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,200
No.

1902
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,220
I don't want it to say fart unleashed.

1903
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:33,860
It's me.

1904
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,360
No.

1905
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,300
Unless that's my face when my cat unleashes its fart.

1906
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:43,900
Ten out of ten.

1907
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:44,440
No notes.

1908
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,440
What an honor for them.

1909
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:52,530
Midcourt already made it?

1910
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:53,550
No, they didn't.

1911
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:54,630
They're not that fast.

1912
01:37:58,770 --> 01:37:59,290
Right?

1913
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:04,630
Stinky.

1914
01:38:04,630 --> 01:38:04,890
Stinky.

1915
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,520
Add a mustache to it.

1916
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:28,540
That's the ugliest mustache I've ever seen.

1917
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:32,000
That's a bit better.

1918
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:39,260
There we go.

1919
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:45,120
So mint was gaseous, snake all...

1920
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,800
No!

1921
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,780
It's not me.

1922
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:52,500
It's not.

1923
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,180
I'm deleting this before anybody else can take it.

1924
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:01,100
The best profile picture.

1925
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:02,060
Thanks for the super chat!

1926
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,300
Next person...

1927
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,600
is...

1928
01:39:15,710 --> 01:39:16,390
B!

1929
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:18,010
Closing parenthesis!

1930
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:22,530
The reason in particular would you be preferred...

1931
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:26,910
Wait, would you prefer to be rounded up 5 foot or down to 4 foot?

1932
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,550
It doesn't...

1933
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:34,150
If something is over 5 doesn't it mean you put it at...

1934
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:37,810
You put it...

1935
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:40,450
to the higher number.

1936
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,210
So 5 foot.

1937
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:47,940
5 foot.

1938
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:49,040
Me.

1939
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:51,600
Me.

1940
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:54,100
B closing parenthesis.

1941
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,200
B...

1942
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:57,720
Closing...

1943
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:57,820
Oh!

1944
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:06,200
Please draw yourself in the coolest, most fresh, fly, radical epic sunglasses in the world.

1945
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:08,480
And a smug smile, please and thank you.

1946
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:09,920
Pray emoji.

1947
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:12,540
I've got you!

1948
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,760
I've got you!

1949
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,400
I've got you, I got you.

1950
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:21,480
Oh, my bad.

1951
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:23,320
Goodbye wheel.

1952
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:23,920
Okay.

1953
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:31,480
Let's see.

1954
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:36,180
Me in the most cool, fly, fresh, awesome...

1955
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:37,340
I can do that.

1956
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:37,680
Hold on.

1957
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,500
Look at these, though.

1958
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:40,760
What?

1959
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:41,320
Wrong thing.

1960
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:47,980
Oh, yeah.

1961
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:15,390
So close.

1962
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:16,370
Hold on.

1963
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:19,870
Maybe if I put them on my face when I'm looking center.

1964
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:23,030
Wait, how do I get the mustache in front?

1965
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:24,210
Uh-oh.

1966
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,090
I think I just...

1967
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:25,570
Oh, my gosh.

1968
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:27,510
I can't move the mustache anymore.

1969
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:28,290
It's stuck forever.

1970
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:29,310
Wait.

1971
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:30,430
Uh-oh.

1972
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:31,410
Hold on.

1973
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:38,750
I don't know how to get rid of the mustache.

1974
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:40,370
Uh-oh.

1975
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:42,690
I don't know how to move it.

1976
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:43,130
Wait.

1977
01:41:43,150 --> 01:41:44,070
When I wanted to bring it...

1978
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:45,810
I wanted it to be in front of the sunglasses.

1979
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:47,810
But now...

1980
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:48,970
Uh-oh.

1981
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,640
The mustache is forever.

1982
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,080
So close.

1983
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:02,700
And so far.

1984
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:12,510
If I look too far over, my head also becomes really big.

1985
01:42:15,950 --> 01:42:16,830
So close.

1986
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:17,570
Oops.

1987
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:24,650
Well, um... you guys like my glasses?

1988
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,640
It's glued on.

1989
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,920
I used a super glue to keep it on, you know?

1990
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:39,240
Okay.

1991
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:43,000
Let's draw me.

1992
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,880
When I think of really awesome glasses...

1993
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:56,240
I don't know why I'm focusing so much on this when I'm just gonna erase most of it.

1994
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:58,030
When I think of really awesome glasses...

1995
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,160
Actually, I'm gonna Google.

1996
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,300
The coolest glasses.

1997
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,800
The coolest glasses in the world.

1998
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,720
Oh, these are...

1999
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,060
No!

2000
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:12,960
These are terrible!

2001
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,540
None of these are cool!

2002
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:19,520
Okay, wait.

2003
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:19,880
Actually...

2004
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:20,800
I actually really like this one.

2005
01:43:24,570 --> 01:43:25,090
Okay.

2006
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:28,350
This is my inspiration.

2007
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:31,590
This is my inspiration.

2008
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:35,350
Why won't you show the picture?

2009
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:37,950
Wait, hold on.

2010
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:40,690
What is going on?

2011
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:41,230
Hello?

2012
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:41,570
Computer?

2013
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:44,010
Uh... uh-oh.

2014
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:44,810
Hello?

2015
01:43:46,410 --> 01:43:48,270
You guys, I think something's wrong with my computer.

2016
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:50,510
What's going on?

2017
01:43:50,910 --> 01:43:51,770
What's going on?

2018
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:54,210
Oh, there it is.

2019
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:55,150
Okay, thank goodness.

2020
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:56,910
Okay, okay, okay.

2021
01:43:57,490 --> 01:43:58,290
Okay, whew.

2022
01:43:59,010 --> 01:43:59,610
All right.

2023
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:00,590
Let's...

2024
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:02,770
All right, this is my...

2025
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:07,210
This is my inspiration.

2026
01:44:10,890 --> 01:44:11,290
Wait!

2027
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:13,630
I can just become this man.

2028
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:14,570
Okay, hold on.

2029
01:44:16,330 --> 01:44:17,050
He's bald.

2030
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,010
I can just take over.

2031
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:19,250
Okay.

2032
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:26,950
We can draw hair on him.

2033
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:34,050
It's like... it's actually perfect.

2034
01:44:36,490 --> 01:44:37,950
It's actually perfect.

2035
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:46,450
Yeah!

2036
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:48,190
I'm so awesome!

2037
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:49,230
I can not believe it!

2038
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:55,370
I'm so cool, I'm so... I'm so cool.

2039
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:02,850
Let's see.

2040
01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:09,390
Let's do this.

2041
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:13,830
And then we'll draw my hair out here too.

2042
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:17,150
Sorry, you're gonna have to crop it, but...

2043
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:19,110
I believe in you.

2044
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:21,310
Actually, I want my hair fluffier.

2045
01:45:24,130 --> 01:45:25,770
No, my hair's not that fluffy.

2046
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:34,920
Oh wait, it goes in.

2047
01:45:35,060 --> 01:45:35,520
Never mind.

2048
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:37,640
Wait.

2049
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,200
It's fine, it's fine.

2050
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,280
Just leave it, just leave it.

2051
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,220
I'm being a perfectionist.

2052
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,620
I'm being a perfectionist.

2053
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:43,840
Okay.

2054
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,180
Then let's put it... let's shade it in.

2055
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:51,760
This time I'll actually use the big brush.

2056
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:52,320
Guns.

2057
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:53,080
Oh no!

2058
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:58,440
Okay, I'm gonna have to do a slightly... slightly less white.

2059
01:45:58,700 --> 01:45:59,160
There we go.

2060
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:03,440
I'm cosplaying Snake and Solidus at the same time.

2061
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:08,580
Slightly less white.

2062
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:10,760
Color.

2063
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:20,290
Don't worry, I'll go back and I'll clean it up after.

2064
01:46:20,430 --> 01:46:21,210
I'll clean it up after.

2065
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:23,710
But you're gonna have to crop it.

2066
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:24,510
Sorry, I'm not...

2067
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:25,070
You know.

2068
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:28,530
Sometimes it... somehow it feels even balder.

2069
01:46:28,570 --> 01:46:29,130
What do you mean?

2070
01:46:30,910 --> 01:46:32,450
Oh wait, but what about...

2071
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:34,590
This part?

2072
01:46:34,850 --> 01:46:35,030
Okay.

2073
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,250
We'll fix it.

2074
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:36,750
We'll fix it.

2075
01:46:38,630 --> 01:46:39,650
I'm gonna fix it.

2076
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:40,350
I'm gonna fix it.

2077
01:46:43,450 --> 01:46:44,570
I'm gonna fix everything.

2078
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:45,690
Don't you worry.

2079
01:46:47,970 --> 01:46:48,810
Don't you worry.

2080
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:50,610
We're gonna go in and we're gonna fix everything.

2081
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:52,430
This is gonna be great.

2082
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:54,990
You forgot to draw the growth?

2083
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:56,210
I'm not there yet!

2084
01:46:56,590 --> 01:46:57,530
And it's not a growth!

2085
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:01,630
I'm still just doing my hair!

2086
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:03,890
So impatient.

2087
01:47:04,830 --> 01:47:05,770
Okay, what was I doing?

2088
01:47:05,930 --> 01:47:06,330
Oh, okay.

2089
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:09,070
Now from here, we're gonna do this, okay?

2090
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:09,930
You see?

2091
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:12,650
We're gonna do that.

2092
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:13,310
We're gonna...

2093
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:15,490
We're gonna get all the edges.

2094
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:18,330
I color outside the lines and then I fix it up.

2095
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:19,970
Maybe it's more time consuming.

2096
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:21,170
I don't care.

2097
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:23,170
I'm just an artist here, okay?

2098
01:47:26,510 --> 01:47:28,590
Stop criticizing my art.

2099
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:34,600
Don't criticize.

2100
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:36,060
That means you hate art.

2101
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:37,780
Do you hate art?

2102
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:42,600
Okay, this time I'm gonna have to...

2103
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:46,040
I'm getting really into this one, so I gotta...

2104
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,020
Oh no.

2105
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:51,400
I don't want you to see...

2106
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:53,300
his skin.

2107
01:47:59,240 --> 01:47:59,720
No.

2108
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:00,520
No, no, no.

2109
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:01,700
Inside the lines.

2110
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:02,540
Inside the lines.

2111
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:03,920
Inside the lines.

2112
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:04,380
Inside...

2113
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:05,360
Inside the lines.

2114
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:06,080
Inside the lines.

2115
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:08,240
Could I have redrawn this?

2116
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:09,620
Probably.

2117
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:12,680
But this is for authenticity's sake, okay?

2118
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:15,900
Uh-oh.

2119
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:16,640
It's gonna disappear.

2120
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,620
Is my head bigger than this man's?

2121
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:22,360
Um, obviously, because I'm smarter.

2122
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:30,620
This is what they wanted, you guys.

2123
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:31,700
This is what they wanted.

2124
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:34,700
This is what they wanted.

2125
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:35,620
This is what they wanted.

2126
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:46,770
And I feel really uncomfortable being this close to this guy's head.

2127
01:48:48,650 --> 01:48:50,790
I feel pretty uncomfortable right now.

2128
01:48:50,810 --> 01:48:51,450
I'm not gonna lie.

2129
01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:53,230
I'm seeing every pore.

2130
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:57,790
Every... every single line in his forehead.

2131
01:48:58,210 --> 01:48:59,250
I'm seeing it all.

2132
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:04,770
I'll never like this guy's hair.

2133
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:04,950
I mean...

2134
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:12,030
He's got nice skin, I'm assuming for his age, you know?

2135
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:13,070
Oops.

2136
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:14,250
You know what, let's not.

2137
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:18,030
What the?

2138
01:49:18,190 --> 01:49:18,830
No, no, no.

2139
01:49:19,570 --> 01:49:20,090
Stop it.

2140
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:21,490
I'm sorry.

2141
01:49:24,610 --> 01:49:26,450
This is the future the boss envisioned.

2142
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:27,910
I can see his white hair.

2143
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:28,310
I know.

2144
01:49:28,370 --> 01:49:29,090
I can see everything.

2145
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:30,430
I can see everything!

2146
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:31,090
I can see everything!

2147
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:33,490
Clean scalp...

2148
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:44,420
Let's clean up this part right here.

2149
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,920
Have you heard that?

2150
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:49,540
No, you didn't!

2151
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:52,740
You know what?

2152
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:53,040
Screw it.

2153
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:53,400
I don't care.

2154
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,280
Alright, let's do...

2155
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:02,380
What if I leave it this way where you can see just his...

2156
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,140
You can see his head peeking through.

2157
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:12,140
There we go.

2158
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,620
Oh, I forgot my... Oh my gosh.

2159
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:17,260
How could I forget my twin tails?

2160
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:18,820
Which was the layer?

2161
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:20,920
This one.

2162
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:23,380
How could I forget my twin tails?

2163
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:24,120
Right?

2164
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,660
Oh my gosh, what's wrong?

2165
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,060
I was like, something feels off.

2166
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,100
No!

2167
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:43,580
My friend Mike has his birthday tomorrow.

2168
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:45,680
Are you serious?

2169
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:50,020
Are you for real?

2170
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:53,240
What's Mike's last name?

2171
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:58,360
What's Mike's last name?

2172
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,600
Tell me right now.

2173
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,080
It's perfect.

2174
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:14,920
It's perfect.

2175
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:15,600
It's perfect.

2176
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:18,080
Don't worry about it.

2177
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:20,300
Hooter.

2178
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:21,880
Like the store?

2179
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:22,780
Like the restaurant?

2180
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:24,240
I've never been to a Hooters.

2181
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:29,190
I've never been to Hooters.

2182
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:32,310
And people say, like, go for the wings.

2183
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:37,290
But then people are also like, the wings aren't that good.

2184
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:38,910
So which is it?

2185
01:51:39,790 --> 01:51:40,830
Which is it?

2186
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:44,450
His last name is Suggma.

2187
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:47,430
I don't believe you.

2188
01:51:49,630 --> 01:51:50,530
That's a Pokemon.

2189
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:56,610
If his last name was Suggma, what...

2190
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:58,510
You know how like, you know, there's like...

2191
01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:00,870
Last names that were...

2192
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:03,530
What they did back then in the day.

2193
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:05,230
Like that originated from that.

2194
01:52:05,330 --> 01:52:07,090
They were like, oh, I'm...

2195
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:08,750
I'm...

2196
01:52:09,310 --> 01:52:10,990
I'm Casey Blacksmith.

2197
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:11,990
You know, stuff like that.

2198
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:15,090
What did they do if their last name was Suggma?

2199
01:52:17,970 --> 01:52:18,810
Hooters is mid?

2200
01:52:19,010 --> 01:52:19,310
Really?

2201
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:23,730
But it's like, it feels like so exciting to think about.

2202
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:26,410
Like, it's just like, wow, I'm going to Hooters.

2203
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:28,310
I'm going to Hooters.

2204
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,400
It looks just like me.

2205
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:48,320
He's already got the mustache, even.

2206
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:51,680
Sucking poison.

2207
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:56,880
I get it.

2208
01:52:56,940 --> 01:52:57,540
I get it.

2209
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:58,060
I get it.

2210
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:04,820
Oh, wait.

2211
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:06,460
I'll make it smaller.

2212
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:07,600
There we go.

2213
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:13,320
I made it smaller so that you can see it.

2214
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:17,800
There we go.

2215
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:18,620
Perfect.

2216
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:24,020
Perfect.

2217
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:26,120
Oh, I got to write your name.

2218
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:30,060
B, closing parentheses.

2219
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:39,970
Wait, can I fit it on his forehead?

2220
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:43,810
My handwriting is too big.

2221
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:44,790
B...

2222
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:48,730
Close...

2223
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:52,850
Close...

2224
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:55,150
Closing...

2225
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:56,410
Closing...

2226
01:53:56,410 --> 01:53:57,010
Argh!

2227
01:53:57,570 --> 01:53:58,710
No!

2228
01:54:02,110 --> 01:54:02,810
P...

2229
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:04,730
Parentheses.

2230
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:07,230
P...

2231
01:54:07,930 --> 01:54:09,110
Po..

2232
01:54:09,110 --> 01:54:09,870
Pa pa...

2233
01:54:09,870 --> 01:54:11,290
Pa Paren...

2234
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:14,050
And...

2235
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:29,680
I hope you like this one.

2236
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,140
I actually put so much effort into it.

2237
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:35,960
I hope you like it.

2238
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:39,080
I think I look really cool.

2239
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:42,240
I think I look really awesome.

2240
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:50,370
Hold on.

2241
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:52,010
Don't take it just yet.

2242
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:02,780
There we go.

2243
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:07,060
There we go.

2244
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:09,520
There we go.

2245
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:11,540
There we go.

2246
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:12,000
Important part.

2247
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:13,000
There we go.

2248
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:17,760
Now it really looks like me.

2249
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,820
It looks so good.

2250
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:21,380
Right?

2251
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:27,460
Hold on.

2252
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:28,480
Let me move my cursor.

2253
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:29,000
There we go.

2254
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,240
Screen cap that.

2255
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:33,180
Screen cap that.

2256
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:34,580
That's yours.

2257
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,600
Be closing parenthesis.

2258
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:39,480
Yeah.

2259
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:42,700
Yeah.

2260
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:43,600
She's okay I guess.

2261
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:44,560
Like maybe she's amazing.

2262
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:45,200
But I don't know.

2263
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,080
Free NFT.

2264
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:50,760
No!

2265
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:56,200
You can't right click and save this.

2266
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:59,780
You can't right click and save art.

2267
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:07,980
It's my picture.

2268
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:09,380
I own the pixels.

2269
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:10,360
I own the pixels.

2270
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:13,500
I created the pixels.

2271
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:14,700
I birthed the pixels.

2272
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:15,900
They are my pixels.

2273
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:17,220
I own these pixels.

2274
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:18,500
You cannot steal my art.

2275
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:19,940
Do not right click save.

2276
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:20,700
Do not right click save.

2277
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:21,360
It is mine.

2278
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:21,780
It is mine.

2279
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:22,220
It is mine.

2280
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,700
I paid the token.

2281
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:24,540
It is mine.

2282
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:24,920
It is mine.

2283
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,740
I own the ownership.

2284
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:26,800
I own it.

2285
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:27,200
I own it.

2286
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:28,240
I have the digital certificate.

2287
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:29,360
It is mine.

2288
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:42,460
I just bought the NFT.

2289
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:50,680
Right clicked.

2290
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:52,280
Don't do that.

2291
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:52,800
It's illegal.

2292
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:56,080
You are literally stealing from me right now.

2293
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:57,760
You are taking my artistic right.

2294
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:00,920
To own this art.

2295
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:04,580
Burst?

2296
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,440
I won't right click save.

2297
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:10,160
I'll just screenshot it instead.

2298
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,260
You can't do that.

2299
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,520
How dare you.

2300
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:18,580
You do not own the actual pixels.

2301
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:21,420
You do not own it.

2302
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:25,340
You do not own it.

2303
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:25,500
You do not own it.

2304
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,260
I own every individual pixel.

2305
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:28,680
I own the hex code.

2306
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,500
You can't have these colors.

2307
01:57:31,540 --> 01:57:32,160
They are mine.

2308
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:33,120
They are on the hex code.

2309
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:41,780
If my model.

2310
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:42,560
If I'm in the way.

2311
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:43,240
If I'm in the way.

2312
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:44,260
If I'm in the way.

2313
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:44,800
If I'm in the way.

2314
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,780
When did my arm go up?

2315
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:51,280
It's kind of freaky actually.

2316
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:56,620
You can't have this.

2317
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:59,080
You can not own this.

2318
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:01,700
You can not own this.

2319
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:03,120
You can not own this.

2320
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:07,840
I'm even taking it back.

2321
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:10,860
Be closing.

2322
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:12,180
Closing parenthesis.

2323
01:58:12,260 --> 01:58:12,860
I'm sorry.

2324
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:44,780
Mine.

2325
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:54,570
Now I can right click and save.

2326
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:55,350
Mint phantom.

2327
01:58:59,970 --> 01:59:01,570
Stop owning me.

2328
01:59:02,690 --> 01:59:03,870
Stop owning me.

2329
01:59:03,950 --> 01:59:04,670
Get owned.

2330
01:59:05,130 --> 01:59:06,550
I will own you.

2331
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:11,170
Stop owning me.

2332
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:12,770
You do not own me.

2333
01:59:14,090 --> 01:59:15,690
Be closing parenthesis.

2334
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:16,710
This is my new identity.

2335
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:19,210
I hope.

2336
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:20,550
I hope they.

2337
01:59:21,130 --> 01:59:23,030
I don't know if they're here in the chat.

2338
01:59:23,130 --> 01:59:23,730
If they are.

2339
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:27,730
Look at the chaos you've caused here.

2340
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:30,430
Look at the chaos you've caused here.

2341
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:31,270
Look at the chaos you've caused here.

2342
01:59:31,270 --> 01:59:31,970
Get owned.

2343
01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:33,670
Get owned.

2344
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:35,090
Anyways, thank you.

2345
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:36,970
I hope you like your profile picture.

2346
01:59:37,290 --> 01:59:38,270
Let's go to the next person.

2347
01:59:38,270 --> 01:59:40,290
Me no habla.

2348
01:59:40,430 --> 01:59:41,150
Hablo.

2349
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:43,470
Isn't it habla english?

2350
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:47,170
Isn't it habla english?

2351
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:56,280
You could say she's been minted.

2352
01:59:56,940 --> 01:59:59,540
Why does it sound so weird like that?

2353
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:05,520
Next up is...

2354
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:07,580
Wimp.

2355
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:08,300
Wimp.

2356
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:12,020
No.

2357
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:14,400
You're not a wimp.

2358
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,280
You're not a wimp.

2359
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:27,160
Wisp.

2360
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:34,920
Wisp.

2361
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:36,040
Wispwillow!

2362
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,560
Oh, you're very strong!

2363
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,800
You're very strong!

2364
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:44,600
Wispwillow, what's your request?

2365
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:47,160
I hope it's like, don't draw me all wimpy, please.

2366
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:51,720
Please draw me looking really cool.

2367
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:56,120
Oh, they said none.

2368
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:57,800
On your request, they said none.

2369
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:01,340
My profile pic being drawn by you is already a lot.

2370
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:05,560
Oh no, they wrote something really nice and I called them a wimp.

2371
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:07,600
No!

2372
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:13,440
I'm sorry, Wispwillow!

2373
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:19,840
I'm sorry, I'll draw you looking really cool.

2374
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,840
I'll draw you looking so awesome.

2375
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,340
Okay, hold on.

2376
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:26,580
Okay.

2377
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:30,560
Since you're a wisp, we're gonna draw you as a wisp.

2378
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,380
Oh, hold on.

2379
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:36,280
I need more space.

2380
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:40,300
But then...

2381
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:44,120
They have beefy arms.

2382
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:48,820
Like that.

2383
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:55,060
Wimp no more!

2384
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:59,280
Wimp no more, beefy wisp.

2385
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,920
Beefy wisp, beefy wisp.

2386
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:07,840
Beefy, beefy wisp.

2387
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:09,720
Beef, beef, beef.

2388
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:11,860
Beef, beef, beef.

2389
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:20,420
Like that.

2390
02:02:22,260 --> 02:02:23,720
Oh yeah.

2391
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:26,920
Oh yeah, gigawisp.

2392
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:30,340
Ghost plus fighting type.

2393
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:32,280
He's ready to throw it down.

2394
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,440
He's ready to go to town.

2395
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:37,940
He's ready to not be on the ground.

2396
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:40,760
He's ready to throw you on the ground.

2397
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:47,500
He's ready to give a big frown.

2398
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:49,580
He's ready to...

2399
02:02:51,020 --> 02:02:52,940
He's ready to...

2400
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:59,520
He's ready to...

2401
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:04,300
He's ready to...

2402
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:06,200
Frown?

2403
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:07,040
Ground.

2404
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:10,920
He's ready to make you round.

2405
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:15,040
Wait, frown and round don't rhyme.

2406
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:15,900
Wait.

2407
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:18,300
Wait, neither do ground.

2408
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:23,700
Wait, am I rhyming frown or am I rhyming...

2409
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:25,700
...pound.

2410
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:29,240
Wait, I said he's ready to go down.

2411
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:29,960
He's ready...

2412
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:30,140
Okay.

2413
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:31,980
He's ready to go to town.

2414
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:33,740
He's ready to...

2415
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:36,320
He's ready to... give a big frown.

2416
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:44,200
He's ready to... he's ready to... throw you around.

2417
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:45,520
No, I did it again.

2418
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:49,160
There's no D at the end.

2419
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:53,460
Take the crown!

2420
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,480
Oh, you are so good.

2421
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:57,460
He's so good.

2422
02:03:57,540 --> 02:03:58,300
Knock you down!

2423
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:03,700
Not knock you up.

2424
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:04,840
He'll knock you down.

2425
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:09,460
He's a beef master.

2426
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:11,260
He's a beef master.

2427
02:04:12,460 --> 02:04:13,200
Let's see.

2428
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:23,580
I wonder if I can... just fill him in.

2429
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:26,480
It's a little bit more blue.

2430
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:29,860
I kind of like this color.

2431
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:31,260
Oh!

2432
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:33,360
Sorry.

2433
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:36,160
Where's the opening at?

2434
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:41,440
I don't see it.

2435
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:45,580
My eyes.

2436
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:48,560
Wear a tasteful gown.

2437
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:52,460
And

2438
02:04:58,050 --> 02:05:00,590
he managed to avoid being true.

2439
02:05:02,690 --> 02:05:04,530
Oh my god.

2440
02:05:06,690 --> 02:05:07,690
Can I do this?

2441
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:08,130
Let's see.

2442
02:05:08,490 --> 02:05:11,110
Can I... No.

2443
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:13,890
That's okay.

2444
02:05:14,530 --> 02:05:15,230
I'll do it.

2445
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,870
I'll make it quick.

2446
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:27,430
I think the color is supposed to be a little lighter blue, but that's fine.

2447
02:05:28,810 --> 02:05:29,410
That's fine.

2448
02:05:29,470 --> 02:05:31,150
Everyone's monitors are different.

2449
02:05:32,690 --> 02:05:35,070
It's the correct color on my monitor, you know.

2450
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:39,410
Left bicep?

2451
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:44,290
Yeah, this is... this is the tri tops.

2452
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:46,870
This is the bi tops.

2453
02:05:47,350 --> 02:05:49,630
This is the ichi tops.

2454
02:05:52,690 --> 02:05:55,990
Honestly, only gym bros would get this, you know.

2455
02:05:56,410 --> 02:06:00,090
Only gym bros would be like, yo, that guy is ripped.

2456
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:06,250
This guy... this guy knows what's going on.

2457
02:06:06,670 --> 02:06:08,710
He's so beefed up.

2458
02:06:13,690 --> 02:06:14,470
Yeah.

2459
02:06:20,610 --> 02:06:22,790
Hell yeah, wispy.

2460
02:06:22,870 --> 02:06:23,650
Yes!

2461
02:06:24,850 --> 02:06:28,650
This guy will go to your gym and he'll be like...

2462
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:31,650
He'll be like...

2463
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:37,210
Uh, don't film TikToks in my gym.

2464
02:06:38,830 --> 02:06:43,070
Today I'm gonna lift... I'm gonna lift every pound.

2465
02:06:45,310 --> 02:06:46,750
I'm gonna take every pound.

2466
02:06:46,990 --> 02:06:49,130
I'm gonna take every pound downtown.

2467
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:50,610
What?

2468
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:52,870
You can't write pound and town.

2469
02:06:53,190 --> 02:06:54,990
What's wrong with me?

2470
02:06:56,290 --> 02:06:56,690
Sorry.

2471
02:06:56,850 --> 02:06:57,190
Okay.

2472
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:00,110
I keep trying to do it.

2473
02:07:00,130 --> 02:07:01,110
I keep trying to make it work.

2474
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:04,110
It does not work.

2475
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:06,310
Oh my

2476
02:07:18,430 --> 02:07:20,570
god.

2477
02:07:20,850 --> 02:07:22,210
Why is my thing so delayed?

2478
02:07:22,350 --> 02:07:22,710
Oh my gosh.

2479
02:07:22,730 --> 02:07:23,570
Thank you for the akazuba!

2480
02:07:24,130 --> 02:07:26,390
I cried with laughter listening to those rhymes.

2481
02:07:26,510 --> 02:07:27,050
Thank you, Vinto.

2482
02:07:27,190 --> 02:07:29,250
World's strongest... ghost...

2483
02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:31,370
What is that?

2484
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:32,410
What's that last word?

2485
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:32,850
I'm scared.

2486
02:07:33,530 --> 02:07:33,930
Nexy!

2487
02:07:34,130 --> 02:07:35,470
Thank you so much for the akadono.

2488
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:36,070
Thank you.

2489
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:36,610
Thank you for the akazuba.

2490
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:37,490
Thank you so much.

2491
02:07:37,550 --> 02:07:38,090
Thank you.

2492
02:07:39,810 --> 02:07:40,830
This is a fart?

2493
02:07:40,970 --> 02:07:41,190
No!

2494
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:44,470
Guys, don't be mean to him.

2495
02:07:44,510 --> 02:07:45,290
He's gonna beat you up.

2496
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:48,910
He has the gains.

2497
02:07:54,170 --> 02:07:55,450
Why would you use that word?

2498
02:07:55,470 --> 02:07:55,950
What does it mean?

2499
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:00,330
Don't call him a wimp.

2500
02:08:00,430 --> 02:08:00,650
Oh yeah.

2501
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:01,890
He says that.

2502
02:08:01,950 --> 02:08:02,750
He says that actually.

2503
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:04,330
You can rhyme however you want, queen.

2504
02:08:04,330 --> 02:08:05,910
Thank you.

2505
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:08,170
Thank you.

2506
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:11,510
Don't.

2507
02:08:11,510 --> 02:08:12,230
Don't.

2508
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:13,190
Oh, wrong letter.

2509
02:08:13,470 --> 02:08:14,210
Actually, it's fine.

2510
02:08:14,910 --> 02:08:15,630
Don't.

2511
02:08:15,630 --> 02:08:17,630
We use punctuation here.

2512
02:08:19,370 --> 02:08:23,450
Call me wimp.

2513
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:28,650
Because I'm Wisp.

2514
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:29,830
It's Wispwillow, right?

2515
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:30,670
Let me double check.

2516
02:08:30,970 --> 02:08:31,650
Yes.

2517
02:08:31,650 --> 02:08:34,510
I'm Wispwillow.

2518
02:08:35,470 --> 02:08:36,110
Wisp.

2519
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:40,090
Willow.

2520
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:45,210
Oh yeah.

2521
02:08:47,130 --> 02:08:47,770
Wispwillow.

2522
02:08:50,150 --> 02:08:50,790
Wispwillow.

2523
02:08:52,430 --> 02:08:53,070
Wispwillow.

2524
02:08:53,110 --> 02:08:54,630
I ain't no wisp.

2525
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:56,070
Wimpwillow.

2526
02:08:56,070 --> 02:08:57,510
I'm a wispwillow.

2527
02:08:58,230 --> 02:08:59,470
That's his theme song.

2528
02:09:00,010 --> 02:09:01,570
He comes into the ring.

2529
02:09:02,670 --> 02:09:03,310
Wispwillow.

2530
02:09:05,490 --> 02:09:06,770
Never wimpwillow.

2531
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:12,310
I'm wispwillow.

2532
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:15,210
Punch in my pillow.

2533
02:09:23,090 --> 02:09:24,770
Never say hello.

2534
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:29,730
Don't call wisp me wimpwillow.

2535
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:30,990
No, that's not what I said.

2536
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:32,570
Shut up, Tudor.

2537
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:33,970
Shut up, Tudor.

2538
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:34,750
That's not what I said.

2539
02:09:34,770 --> 02:09:35,690
Don't put words into my mouth.

2540
02:09:36,790 --> 02:09:37,190
Okay.

2541
02:09:37,350 --> 02:09:39,410
I hope you like that, Wispwillow.

2542
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:39,930
Thank you.

2543
02:09:40,190 --> 02:09:41,150
Thank you for entering.

2544
02:09:42,770 --> 02:09:43,790
Thank you very much.

2545
02:09:44,050 --> 02:09:44,630
Oh my gosh.

2546
02:09:44,670 --> 02:09:45,750
It's already been two hours.

2547
02:09:45,970 --> 02:09:46,930
Holy cow.

2548
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:49,070
Holy cow.

2549
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:55,710
Please wrap it up.

2550
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:57,290
Why are you so mean to me?

2551
02:10:08,610 --> 02:10:10,050
Next up is...

2552
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:16,190
Linery.

2553
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:18,390
Linery.

2554
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:18,690
Wow.

2555
02:10:18,930 --> 02:10:19,550
Oh my gosh.

2556
02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:21,290
My chat is actually like..

2557
02:10:21,290 --> 02:10:23,270
I think there's something wrong with my computer today.

2558
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:31,510
All the text disappeared for a second.

2559
02:10:33,590 --> 02:10:34,070
Linery.

2560
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:36,810
Is that what you go by?

2561
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:37,510
This is at.

2562
02:10:38,270 --> 02:10:39,870
Hi, Mai- Hi, Bijan.

2563
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:41,030
Hello.

2564
02:10:41,570 --> 02:10:42,570
Hello, hello, hello.

2565
02:10:42,570 --> 02:10:42,710
Linery.

2566
02:10:46,950 --> 02:10:48,090
It's probably just YouTube?

2567
02:10:48,270 --> 02:10:49,550
I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

2568
02:10:50,210 --> 02:10:51,670
I think it's on YouTube then?

2569
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:52,130
Maybe.

2570
02:10:55,270 --> 02:10:58,270
Oh, do as you please with a little heart.

2571
02:11:04,510 --> 02:11:06,310
So much artistic freedom.

2572
02:11:18,990 --> 02:11:20,430
When are you in chat?

2573
02:11:20,710 --> 02:11:21,990
Oh, hello!

2574
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:23,050
Hello!

2575
02:11:26,530 --> 02:11:27,410
Hello!

2576
02:11:27,410 --> 02:11:29,310
What do you want?

2577
02:11:29,630 --> 02:11:30,910
I can give you anything!

2578
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:35,050
I can draw your world.

2579
02:11:36,670 --> 02:11:39,630
Sparkling, shimmering, wimpy.

2580
02:11:40,410 --> 02:11:46,090
Or if you don't want to, be wimpy, please let me know.

2581
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:50,410
I can open your eyes.

2582
02:11:50,690 --> 02:11:55,330
Or make them close if you want to.

2583
02:11:55,610 --> 02:11:59,790
I can make you buff or sad.

2584
02:11:59,910 --> 02:12:03,290
Or even have a beard.

2585
02:12:03,550 --> 02:12:06,630
A whole new profile picture.

2586
02:12:08,330 --> 02:12:11,070
Add black glasses like yours.

2587
02:12:11,270 --> 02:12:11,670
Oh, okay.

2588
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:12,410
Wait, to what?

2589
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:14,370
To your profile?

2590
02:12:14,550 --> 02:12:16,030
I can't even tell what it is.

2591
02:12:17,490 --> 02:12:18,930
Looks like an anime girl.

2592
02:12:19,070 --> 02:12:22,770
Okay, I'll draw an anime girl with black glasses.

2593
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:24,210
I'll make her cute.

2594
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:28,830
I'll make her cute.

2595
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:33,600
Okay.

2596
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:36,240
Good start.

2597
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:39,940
Hold on, she has short hair, right?

2598
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:41,440
Where'd you go?

2599
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:43,120
Where'd you go?

2600
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:44,800
Where'd you go?

2601
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:45,120
Oh.

2602
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:47,680
Yeah, she's got short hair.

2603
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:48,180
Okay.

2604
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:55,360
Like this short, right?

2605
02:12:55,480 --> 02:12:56,660
It looks pretty short.

2606
02:13:01,690 --> 02:13:02,770
That's ugly, sorry.

2607
02:13:02,990 --> 02:13:03,590
Oh gosh.

2608
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:05,290
I don't know how to draw.

2609
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:06,350
Why did I ever say...

2610
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:07,010
Oh my god, Katsu!

2611
02:13:07,370 --> 02:13:08,730
Thank you for the...

2612
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:10,350
50, thank you!

2613
02:13:10,890 --> 02:13:11,970
Thank you so much.

2614
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:14,050
There we go.

2615
02:13:15,550 --> 02:13:18,330
And we're gonna put some cool black glasses on.

2616
02:13:22,570 --> 02:13:25,290
Wait, I think it's running into their little smile.

2617
02:13:27,570 --> 02:13:28,210
Oh.

2618
02:13:28,290 --> 02:13:29,090
Whoa, whoa.

2619
02:13:30,730 --> 02:13:32,150
Looks like Velma.

2620
02:13:33,150 --> 02:13:33,790
Drinkies!

2621
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:38,410
Drinkies!

2622
02:13:39,350 --> 02:13:39,990
Drinkies!

2623
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:41,610
Drinkies!

2624
02:13:42,270 --> 02:13:42,910
Ahem.

2625
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:46,950
Jankies.

2626
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:49,750
Um...

2627
02:13:56,050 --> 02:13:57,270
They're gonna be waving.

2628
02:13:58,150 --> 02:13:58,850
Like...

2629
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:00,570
Hello.

2630
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:03,110
Hi.

2631
02:14:03,530 --> 02:14:05,510
Okay, they're either waving...

2632
02:14:05,510 --> 02:14:07,610
Or they're saying...

2633
02:14:07,610 --> 02:14:10,250
Give me five dollars.

2634
02:14:12,690 --> 02:14:14,730
Give me five dollars.

2635
02:14:16,690 --> 02:14:17,810
Oh, sorry.

2636
02:14:17,890 --> 02:14:19,370
I forgot to do the glasses.

2637
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:22,070
Okay, hold on.

2638
02:14:35,950 --> 02:14:36,610
That's four?

2639
02:14:36,850 --> 02:14:37,550
Oh, you're right.

2640
02:14:40,250 --> 02:14:42,030
Give me four dollars.

2641
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:43,990
You know, that's better because that's a spooky number.

2642
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:46,210
That's what I meant to point.

2643
02:14:46,330 --> 02:14:48,550
As a ghost, I can only count up to four.

2644
02:14:48,650 --> 02:14:51,990
Because anything beyond five doesn't really matter.

2645
02:14:53,770 --> 02:14:56,870
I think beyond four doesn't matter at all.

2646
02:14:57,010 --> 02:14:59,610
Because only five dollars matter.

2647
02:14:59,730 --> 02:15:01,770
I mean, no, only four dollars matter.

2648
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:10,550
Give me four dollars!

2649
02:15:16,770 --> 02:15:24,510
Let's see... she's got a little bit of a blush here.

2650
02:15:26,830 --> 02:15:31,130
The hair color that your profile picture has is kind of an ashy...

2651
02:15:32,870 --> 02:15:36,610
It's like a yellowy grayish color.

2652
02:15:36,890 --> 02:15:37,290
Maybe...

2653
02:15:37,870 --> 02:15:38,590
Yeah, I like that.

2654
02:15:38,930 --> 02:15:39,330
Perfect.

2655
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:51,120
Oh my gosh.

2656
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:53,020
Thanks for the four dollars!

2657
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:57,300
Thank you!

2658
02:15:58,300 --> 02:15:58,700
Stop.

2659
02:15:58,840 --> 02:15:59,300
Okay, it's okay.

2660
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:00,380
You guys can stop now.

2661
02:16:00,420 --> 02:16:01,300
You guys can stop now.

2662
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:02,860
The bit's over.

2663
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:03,360
The bit's done.

2664
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:04,800
We've left the bit.

2665
02:16:05,180 --> 02:16:06,740
We've abandoned the bit.

2666
02:16:06,860 --> 02:16:07,680
The bit is done.

2667
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:08,380
The bit is over.

2668
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:14,900
We are moving on to the next thing.

2669
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:18,880
Thank you!

2670
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:20,840
Beige?

2671
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:23,220
I guess it's kind of beige, right?

2672
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:27,400
I guess beige is a better way to put it.

2673
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:30,820
But it's like... when you go to the hair salon...

2674
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:33,400
This hair color is like very popular.

2675
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:38,040
Like, Mumei's hair color is extremely popular in Japan right now.

2676
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:42,620
And it's like a dusty brown is how they describe it.

2677
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:46,020
And dusty colors right now are like extremely popular.

2678
02:16:46,100 --> 02:16:47,960
Like dusty pink...

2679
02:16:50,060 --> 02:16:51,280
Anything dusty.

2680
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:55,100
And they mean it in like a good way.

2681
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:59,100
Kind of looks like Yuno from Hidamari Sketch.

2682
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:01,880
Really?

2683
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:02,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2684
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:04,520
It's like ash.

2685
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:04,920
Yeah, yeah.

2686
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:06,020
They say ashy.

2687
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:06,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2688
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:07,780
They don't say dusty.

2689
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:08,520
They say ashy.

2690
02:17:08,540 --> 02:17:08,920
Thank you.

2691
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:10,400
Yeah, yeah.

2692
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:12,300
They say like ashy brown.

2693
02:17:17,820 --> 02:17:18,900
What was I going to say?

2694
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:22,240
Kotori hair.

2695
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:23,440
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2696
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:34,600
My... What was I going to say?

2697
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:35,960
Oh my gosh.

2698
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,160
Oh, my friend.

2699
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:44,960
When she went to... When I met with her last...

2700
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:47,920
She had gotten... She had gotten her hair done and...

2701
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:49,980
I was like, oh my gosh, I love the color because she...

2702
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:56,340
The color was that... was that ashy brown.

2703
02:17:56,660 --> 02:17:58,320
I was like, oh my gosh, it looks so good.

2704
02:17:58,520 --> 02:17:59,980
I've kind of considered it before.

2705
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:01,480
It's just so cute.

2706
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:06,660
Stop dissing Mumu.

2707
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:07,280
What do you mean?

2708
02:18:08,360 --> 02:18:10,080
I'm not dissing her at all.

2709
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:11,620
I'm saying the color is nice.

2710
02:18:13,240 --> 02:18:14,980
What do you mean I'm dissing her?

2711
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:16,700
I like the color.

2712
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:18,540
What are you talking about?

2713
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:20,540
What are you talking about?

2714
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:23,000
Okay.

2715
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:23,980
This was... Oh.

2716
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:25,480
Let me write your name.

2717
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:40,640
Wait, hold on.

2718
02:18:40,680 --> 02:18:41,760
Let me make that E nicer.

2719
02:18:58,330 --> 02:18:59,690
Thank you, Linerie.

2720
02:19:00,050 --> 02:19:00,930
Thank you.

2721
02:19:00,970 --> 02:19:01,850
Thank you, thank you.

2722
02:19:04,110 --> 02:19:04,970
Thank you.

2723
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:11,770
It's funny how Mumei's ponytail is longer than some people are tall.

2724
02:19:12,290 --> 02:19:13,850
Wait, how long is her ponytail?

2725
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:19,670
Her last name is Nanashi, right?

2726
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:20,510
Yeah.

2727
02:19:20,610 --> 02:19:21,510
Mumei Nanashi.

2728
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:28,350
Oh my god.

2729
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:29,330
Wow.

2730
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:30,830
It's so fluffy.

2731
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:34,410
It's so long.

2732
02:19:35,530 --> 02:19:37,190
It's not past her feet.

2733
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:40,970
It's like to her... the middle of her...

2734
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:44,330
calves.

2735
02:19:46,010 --> 02:19:47,590
It's still pretty long though.

2736
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:53,170
No name.

2737
02:19:53,710 --> 02:19:54,650
No name.

2738
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:55,170
No name.

2739
02:19:58,630 --> 02:19:59,230
Nice.

2740
02:19:59,510 --> 02:19:59,710
Okay.

2741
02:20:02,670 --> 02:20:03,270
Alrighty.

2742
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:04,110
Oh wait.

2743
02:20:04,270 --> 02:20:05,930
Let me make this bigger for you.

2744
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:07,570
For when you screenshot it.

2745
02:20:07,630 --> 02:20:08,110
I'm so sorry.

2746
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:08,790
I should have...

2747
02:20:08,790 --> 02:20:10,330
I should have done that.

2748
02:20:10,390 --> 02:20:10,670
Hold on.

2749
02:20:11,450 --> 02:20:13,170
Let me make this bigger for you.

2750
02:20:13,930 --> 02:20:15,470
For when you screenshot it.

2751
02:20:17,450 --> 02:20:18,330
There you go.

2752
02:20:19,410 --> 02:20:20,190
There you go.

2753
02:20:22,230 --> 02:20:22,710
Linerie.

2754
02:20:22,710 --> 02:20:23,570
Thank you.

2755
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:24,730
You're welcome.

2756
02:20:24,850 --> 02:20:26,690
I hope it's what you wanted.

2757
02:20:28,450 --> 02:20:30,990
I hope... I hope it was good enough.

2758
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:33,770
Hopefully.

2759
02:20:36,770 --> 02:20:37,290
Okay.

2760
02:20:37,290 --> 02:20:38,430
Next person.

2761
02:20:53,610 --> 02:20:54,490
Oh, one second.

2762
02:20:56,630 --> 02:20:57,150
Okay.

2763
02:21:01,460 --> 02:21:02,580
It could be you.

2764
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:04,400
It could be you.

2765
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:05,380
It could be you.

2766
02:21:05,620 --> 02:21:06,860
It could be you.

2767
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:07,740
It could be you.

2768
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,040
It's you.

2769
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:15,080
It's you, Cashews.

2770
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:15,880
Cashews.

2771
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:18,880
It's you, Cashews.

2772
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:19,500
It's you.

2773
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:26,580
Cashews, if you're here, please stand up.

2774
02:21:28,180 --> 02:21:29,620
Please stand up.

2775
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:32,500
It's me.

2776
02:21:32,620 --> 02:21:33,560
It's not you.

2777
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:34,200
You're Raymac.

2778
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,600
You're not Cashews.

2779
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:39,840
You're not Cashews.

2780
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:40,660
I love gamble.

2781
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:41,420
Yeah, but it's free.

2782
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:42,180
It's free gamble.

2783
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:43,200
Okay.

2784
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:44,700
I'm going to get rid of these sunglasses now.

2785
02:21:46,780 --> 02:21:48,480
As really awesome as I look.

2786
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:53,260
Cashews.

2787
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:54,600
My favorite nut.

2788
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:56,880
My favorite nut?

2789
02:21:57,020 --> 02:21:57,260
Okay.

2790
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:01,040
My favorite nut is...

2791
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:03,600
Why did I almost just say raspberries?

2792
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:09,160
Um...

2793
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:12,860
Um, no.

2794
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:13,700
Um...

2795
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:15,940
It's a...

2796
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:24,520
Maybe mine is actually Cashews.

2797
02:22:27,580 --> 02:22:31,900
They asked for Doman Cashew from G Gundam.

2798
02:22:32,020 --> 02:22:35,360
But it's just his hair and clothes on a cashew nut.

2799
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:37,520
Doman Cashew.

2800
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:43,140
Okay.

2801
02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:45,820
I have to look this guy up.

2802
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:56,400
Oh, Wait, there's a cashew n the chat.

2803
02:22:56,860 --> 02:22:57,560
You're... wait.

2804
02:22:57,660 --> 02:22:59,100
This is just like with Turtles.

2805
02:22:59,360 --> 02:23:00,140
And turtle.

2806
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:00,820
How does...

2807
02:23:00,820 --> 02:23:01,540
How is this happening?

2808
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:02,100
More than.

2809
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,020
More than once.

2810
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:05,140
What?

2811
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:06,940
If I looked up just Cashew...

2812
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:07,580
Oh my gosh.

2813
02:23:09,260 --> 02:23:09,840
Oh, wait.

2814
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:11,700
Oh, no.

2815
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:12,380
I don't see you.

2816
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:14,520
There's just cashews.

2817
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:15,000
Cashew.

2818
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:15,840
Did you not submit...

2819
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:22,680
Oh my gosh, turtle!

2820
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:25,360
I like your profile picture.

2821
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:30,500
I like your profile picture.

2822
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:38,460
Cashews and cashew are both in chat.

2823
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:40,760
Oh, there's... wait, I didn't enter.

2824
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:42,780
I need to keep my picture for branding.

2825
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:45,240
Branding.

2826
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:45,900
I understand.

2827
02:23:46,300 --> 02:23:46,840
That's okay.

2828
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:48,240
I get it.

2829
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:49,920
It could have been you.

2830
02:23:52,040 --> 02:23:52,860
I get it.

2831
02:23:53,020 --> 02:23:55,160
I'm not good enough for your brand, huh?

2832
02:23:57,220 --> 02:23:58,140
Thank you, thank you.

2833
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:00,640
Four dollars.

2834
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:02,800
No more, no less.

2835
02:24:03,220 --> 02:24:03,980
Thank you!

2836
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:06,460
Very true.

2837
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:08,660
And I get to keep all of that.

2838
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:14,780
Because if it was YouTube, they'd take 30%.

2839
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:18,540
But I get to keep that.

2840
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:26,860
Cashews are actually related to poison ivy and can't be touched with your bare hands.

2841
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:27,420
Really?

2842
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:30,180
Really?

2843
02:24:30,980 --> 02:24:32,300
I'm always so scared.

2844
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:38,380
What if one day I get an almond that devolved and I eat it and it's poisonous?

2845
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:40,420
You know what I mean?

2846
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:47,520
What if it returns to being an evil almond?

2847
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:49,720
And I eat it and I die?

2848
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:52,320
What if it genetically regresses?

2849
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,800
And then I... I mean, I'm already dead, but like...

2850
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:57,120
I worry for you guys.

2851
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:05,680
Wait, really?

2852
02:25:07,300 --> 02:25:08,400
What do you mean, really?

2853
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,240
Did you not know that about almonds?

2854
02:25:16,890 --> 02:25:19,670
Is Streamlab still blocked for you or are they paying you now?

2855
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:20,610
I haven't...

2856
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:23,610
I haven't received any money since I...

2857
02:25:23,610 --> 02:25:24,590
Well, like, it's...

2858
02:25:24,590 --> 02:25:26,610
It's all trapped in PayPal.

2859
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:30,470
And then YouTube hasn't paid me.

2860
02:25:30,570 --> 02:25:31,790
So I haven't received any...

2861
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:34,450
I haven't received anything.

2862
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:35,330
But it's okay.

2863
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:35,830
I'm alright.

2864
02:25:37,710 --> 02:25:39,190
I still paid rent.

2865
02:25:39,310 --> 02:25:39,670
I'm okay.

2866
02:25:40,830 --> 02:25:41,970
This sounds fake.

2867
02:25:42,030 --> 02:25:42,850
What are you talking about?

2868
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:43,930
No almonds...

2869
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:45,810
Almonds used to be poisonous.

2870
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:49,810
Almonds used to be poisonous.

2871
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:50,410
It's true.

2872
02:25:58,680 --> 02:26:01,820
Yeah, it's just in PayPal jail because...

2873
02:26:01,820 --> 02:26:04,020
Well, I'm really lucky I can use PayPal because...

2874
02:26:04,020 --> 02:26:06,720
What happened before I graduated was...

2875
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:09,320
They marked me as suspicious.

2876
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:10,680
And I...

2877
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:11,740
And they were like...

2878
02:26:11,740 --> 02:26:13,720
You can never use PayPal again.

2879
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:16,620
You can never open another PayPal again in your life.

2880
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:18,560
You can never even smell.

2881
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:20,460
You can never look.

2882
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:23,220
You don't even glance in our direction.

2883
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:25,100
PayPal hates you now.

2884
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:26,720
You are on the hit list.

2885
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:27,400
You are...

2886
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:29,760
You are forever banned.

2887
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:35,660
For the silly drawings.

2888
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:36,620
Ah, thanks!

2889
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:40,560
And so...

2890
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:45,300
I had to come up with another way to get the Streamlabs donations.

2891
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:47,440
And...

2892
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:49,520
And...

2893
02:26:51,080 --> 02:26:52,600
That was three years ago.

2894
02:26:52,740 --> 02:26:54,560
Yeah, it was three years ago that happened.

2895
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:56,340
But...

2896
02:26:56,340 --> 02:26:57,340
I figured...

2897
02:26:57,340 --> 02:26:57,980
I have...

2898
02:26:57,980 --> 02:26:58,480
I have...

2899
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:00,600
Worked around it...

2900
02:27:01,380 --> 02:27:02,560
To the best of my ability.

2901
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:07,240
So...

2902
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:09,760
Yeah...

2903
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:10,920
It was complicated.

2904
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:13,560
So it's still a problem.

2905
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:14,740
Kind of.

2906
02:27:16,060 --> 02:27:17,060
But it's okay.

2907
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:18,320
I...

2908
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:20,000
I hear that happens all the time...

2909
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:20,860
Or not all the time...

2910
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:20,960
But...

2911
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:22,380
More often than it should.

2912
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:23,060
Where it's like...

2913
02:27:23,060 --> 02:27:23,420
I see...

2914
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:24,040
Like...

2915
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:25,400
Artists who will be like...

2916
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:26,720
My PayPal got...

2917
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:27,860
Banned forever.

2918
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:29,860
And I can't do anything about it.

2919
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:32,000
So...

2920
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,500
PayPal is kind of...

2921
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:34,260
Icky.

2922
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,520
Can't you contact their customer support?

2923
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:38,140
Oh, yeah.

2924
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:39,180
I definitely tried.

2925
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:40,420
And...

2926
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:42,460
They were like...

2927
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:42,800
Sorry.

2928
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:44,600
We literally can't do anything.

2929
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:47,000
I was like...

2930
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:47,660
Oh...

2931
02:27:47,660 --> 02:27:48,580
Okay.

2932
02:27:51,540 --> 02:27:52,100
Thanks.

2933
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:53,280
For nothing.

2934
02:27:55,740 --> 02:27:56,300
So...

2935
02:27:56,300 --> 02:27:57,060
Yeah.

2936
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:00,220
It's fine though.

2937
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:01,240
It's fine.

2938
02:28:01,820 --> 02:28:02,860
Things are fine.

2939
02:28:04,860 --> 02:28:06,080
Things are fine.

2940
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:06,920
It's just the issue...

2941
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:08,300
I think...

2942
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:10,840
I think when I went to heaven...

2943
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:11,940
I was very excited.

2944
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:12,680
Because I was like...

2945
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:13,040
Oh my gosh.

2946
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:15,480
I don't have to deal with PayPal anymore.

2947
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:17,540
I don't like...

2948
02:28:17,540 --> 02:28:20,040
I was like, oh my gosh, I never have to deal with them anymore!

2949
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:21,600
This is so awesome!

2950
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:24,780
And then when I came back, I was like...

2951
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:30,240
The troubles of being indie.

2952
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:36,860
But I was like, oh man...

2953
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:39,320
It's funny, I was talking to...

2954
02:28:41,020 --> 02:28:42,400
I was talking to...

2955
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:44,500
Matara last night.

2956
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:45,820
And like...

2957
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:49,180
With the relay, I was just like...

2958
02:28:49,180 --> 02:28:50,620
Man, it was so awesome seeing...

2959
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:53,340
Because I tried to watch mostly everybody.

2960
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:55,980
But I had some stuff to do later on in the night.

2961
02:29:01,460 --> 02:29:03,700
It was so fun seeing...

2962
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:06,500
Everybody cheering on their...

2963
02:29:11,320 --> 02:29:12,520
How do I say?

2964
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:13,740
Their genmates, I guess?

2965
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:14,480
They were just like...

2966
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:15,020
Woohoo!

2967
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:16,760
The...

2968
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:17,940
I'm from...

2969
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:19,120
I'm from...

2970
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:20,500
I'm from...

2971
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:20,960
Idol!

2972
02:29:21,180 --> 02:29:22,640
And this person is also from Idol!

2973
02:29:22,740 --> 02:29:22,980
Let's go!

2974
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:24,100
You know, stuff like that.

2975
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:25,620
So I was just like...

2976
02:29:25,620 --> 02:29:26,260
Man...

2977
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:26,760
I kind of...

2978
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:27,460
I'm like...

2979
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:28,420
I don't know...

2980
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:29,980
I was telling her...

2981
02:29:29,980 --> 02:29:30,360
I was just like...

2982
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:31,160
I feel kind of lonely.

2983
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:34,400
I have no camaraderie with people anymore.

2984
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:36,740
And I was just like...

2985
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:37,540
I wish...

2986
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:39,200
I could have become...

2987
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:40,580
I wish I could have come back...

2988
02:29:40,580 --> 02:29:42,240
Or become indie with like...

2989
02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:44,100
With a group of people.

2990
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:44,560
Or something.

2991
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:45,820
So that...

2992
02:29:45,820 --> 02:29:46,900
We could like...

2993
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:47,460
Stick together.

2994
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:48,680
And she was just like...

2995
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:49,560
She was like...

2996
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:49,720
Wow!

2997
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:50,680
You know...

2998
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:51,680
Like...

2999
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:54,200
She was actually kind of surprised.

3000
02:29:54,440 --> 02:29:55,360
But I was like...

3001
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:55,720
I don't know.

3002
02:29:55,780 --> 02:29:57,420
I just kind of miss having like the...

3003
02:29:58,360 --> 02:29:58,720
Camaraderie.

3004
02:29:58,740 --> 02:29:59,300
But it was...

3005
02:29:59,300 --> 02:30:00,320
That's why I told her...

3006
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:00,600
I was like...

3007
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:01,680
I'm really grateful that she...

3008
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:04,240
Is inviting me to so many collabs.

3009
02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:04,860
Because I'm just...

3010
02:30:04,860 --> 02:30:05,780
I'm just kind of like lonely.

3011
02:30:07,900 --> 02:30:09,560
I'm just kind of like lonely a little bit.

3012
02:30:09,740 --> 02:30:10,640
She was just like...

3013
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:12,520
If there is anybody that I know...

3014
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:13,660
That like...

3015
02:30:13,660 --> 02:30:14,080
You know...

3016
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:15,340
You want to collab with...

3017
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:15,980
Just let me know.

3018
02:30:16,140 --> 02:30:16,520
And I'll...

3019
02:30:17,020 --> 02:30:17,260
I'll...

3020
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:18,900
Get you in contact with them.

3021
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:20,380
So she's been helping out a lot.

3022
02:30:20,580 --> 02:30:21,080
And you know...

3023
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:22,480
I'm really grateful that she like...

3024
02:30:22,480 --> 02:30:24,700
Has been organizing the collabs with...

3025
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:25,680
With...

3026
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:27,220
With me and stuff.

3027
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:29,080
So...

3028
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:30,540
But yeah...

3029
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:32,980
It's been like...

3030
02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:35,380
Not bothering me.

3031
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:36,020
But it's just...

3032
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:36,300
You know...

3033
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:36,780
Kind of...

3034
02:30:38,060 --> 02:30:39,020
Something that's...

3035
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:41,240
Been on my mind a little bit.

3036
02:30:41,980 --> 02:30:42,760
And stuff.

3037
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:43,460
And then I'm...

3038
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:43,880
You know...

3039
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:44,060
I'm kind of like...

3040
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:44,500
Kind of shy.

3041
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:46,040
So I don't reach out to people.

3042
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:47,760
So it's kind of also my fault.

3043
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:48,700
But I should...

3044
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:50,040
Reach out to people.

3045
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:51,340
Since I'm...

3046
02:30:52,140 --> 02:30:53,160
Sad and lonely.

3047
02:30:58,920 --> 02:30:59,880
But yeah...

3048
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:00,480
It's okay.

3049
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:04,000
Did I pull another person?

3050
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:05,920
Oh my god.

3051
02:31:05,960 --> 02:31:07,940
Cassius is over here being like...

3052
02:31:07,940 --> 02:31:08,160
Uh...

3053
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:08,440
Hello?

3054
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:11,180
Um...

3055
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:12,720
Can I get my...

3056
02:31:13,320 --> 02:31:13,800
My...

3057
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:14,060
My...

3058
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:15,040
My Gundam...

3059
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:17,040
Drawing?

3060
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:17,320
Please?

3061
02:31:18,980 --> 02:31:21,300
Let me google them.

3062
02:31:23,020 --> 02:31:23,980
Oh!

3063
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:25,260
This guy!

3064
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:26,820
This guy!

3065
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:29,120
This guy is so awesome!

3066
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:31,380
Um...

3067
02:31:31,380 --> 02:31:31,640
Okay.

3068
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:31,900
Hold on.

3069
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:34,220
What outfit though?

3070
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:40,380
What outfit though?

3071
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:42,840
Um...

3072
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:44,060
What outfit though?

3073
02:31:46,220 --> 02:31:47,180
Uh huh.

3074
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:51,480
Hell yeah, he is.

3075
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:51,860
Yeah!

3076
02:31:57,580 --> 02:32:01,680
Speaking of cassius, my neighbor has a cashew tree and my fridge is full of them.

3077
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:06,280
Cashew juice is super- I'm so jealous because cusses are so expensive.

3078
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:08,160
Nice!

3079
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:11,280
I believe mint can make friends despite her smell.

3080
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:13,280
What do you mean, despite my smell?

3081
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:14,380
I'm so minty fresh!

3082
02:32:15,260 --> 02:32:16,100
It's not me.

3083
02:32:16,100 --> 02:32:16,720
I can see that smelly.

3084
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:18,600
He has multiple?

3085
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:23,000
Oh my god, I see your profile picture.

3086
02:32:24,860 --> 02:32:25,900
Okay, hold on.

3087
02:32:28,220 --> 02:32:29,720
Like, I see this one.

3088
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:32,420
But I think your profile picture...

3089
02:32:32,420 --> 02:32:34,400
This one is from Dynasty Warriors though.

3090
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:39,080
I think your profile picture seems to be his normal outfit.

3091
02:32:39,300 --> 02:32:40,100
Okay, so there's this one.

3092
02:32:40,600 --> 02:32:41,880
And then there's...

3093
02:32:42,820 --> 02:32:44,060
I don't want to cosplay.

3094
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:48,600
This one?

3095
02:32:48,980 --> 02:32:50,940
It's so tiny, why is it so small?

3096
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:52,100
I can't see it.

3097
02:32:52,540 --> 02:32:53,380
This one?

3098
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:55,620
This one but with the red cape.

3099
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:57,840
Which do you want?

3100
02:33:03,100 --> 02:33:05,300
Excuse me, spiky bread coming through.

3101
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:06,340
No!

3102
02:33:07,820 --> 02:33:08,880
Stop, it hurts!

3103
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:11,660
That's his Gundam fighter suit.

3104
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:19,500
That one is good enough.

3105
02:33:20,020 --> 02:33:20,860
Which one?

3106
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:22,560
I posted both.

3107
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:27,380
I'll just do the one on the left maybe.

3108
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:32,320
Because I think that's what he's wearing in your profile picture.

3109
02:33:34,820 --> 02:33:37,540
In my mind, you smell like Baja Blast and not mint.

3110
02:33:37,700 --> 02:33:39,300
I don't even know what that smells like.

3111
02:33:39,420 --> 02:33:40,940
But I'm assuming it's fruity, right?

3112
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:45,280
That one.

3113
02:33:45,460 --> 02:33:46,720
Yeah, that one.

3114
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:47,700
I pick that one.

3115
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:50,160
Pick number three, my lord.

3116
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:54,580
Okay, I'm gonna have this on the screen though.

3117
02:33:54,920 --> 02:33:55,780
Wait, there we go.

3118
02:33:55,980 --> 02:33:57,320
Okay, put that right over there.

3119
02:33:58,880 --> 02:33:59,280
And...

3120
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:04,020
It's chemical-y?

3121
02:34:05,800 --> 02:34:06,780
Oh, they said left.

3122
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:07,860
Oh, okay, thank you.

3123
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:10,300
Oh!

3124
02:34:10,820 --> 02:34:12,000
Thank you, thank you.

3125
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:15,740
This hand of mine glows with an awesome power.

3126
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:18,980
It's burning grip tells me to defeat you.

3127
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:21,920
It makes sense if you watch G Gundam.

3128
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:23,320
Thanks, Virulent.

3129
02:34:28,540 --> 02:34:31,500
Okay, I now need to find a picture of Akashu.

3130
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:35,600
What?

3131
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:42,500
I think I'm gonna be sick.

3132
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:45,120
This is what cashews look like?

3133
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:47,220
From the tree?

3134
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:52,260
I realize I've never seen a cashew on a tree before.

3135
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:53,700
And it's hideous.

3136
02:34:54,060 --> 02:34:55,520
It's disgusting!

3137
02:34:55,580 --> 02:34:56,680
What is this?

3138
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:59,980
Oh my god, it looks like a little worm coming out!

3139
02:35:00,740 --> 02:35:02,060
Oh my god!

3140
02:35:03,080 --> 02:35:04,440
Oh my god, it's awful.

3141
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:06,180
Look at this!

3142
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:10,180
Look at this!

3143
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:11,000
Oh my god!

3144
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:13,620
What?

3145
02:35:13,880 --> 02:35:15,140
What is this?

3146
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:23,040
It looks so gross!

3147
02:35:25,980 --> 02:35:28,740
It's like an apple with a worm coming out!

3148
02:35:31,400 --> 02:35:32,080
Wow!

3149
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:37,580
I've never seen a cashew tree before!

3150
02:35:38,360 --> 02:35:39,640
Oh no!

3151
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:43,140
Oh my god, these are so gross!

3152
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:48,180
No!

3153
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:56,100
Wait, the cashew nut is not the top part?

3154
02:35:58,680 --> 02:35:59,360
Wait.

3155
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:00,820
Where's the cashew nut?

3156
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:02,320
It's the top part, right?

3157
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:05,460
Don't seed shame it.

3158
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:08,980
Where do you...

3159
02:36:15,220 --> 02:36:16,940
Where's the cashew nut?

3160
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:20,360
Is it inside here?

3161
02:36:21,060 --> 02:36:21,920
Inside this part?

3162
02:36:24,320 --> 02:36:24,880
Or...

3163
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:26,560
Because this looks like it's cut open.

3164
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:28,340
And there's no cashew nut here.

3165
02:36:31,100 --> 02:36:33,360
Mint ruined cashews for herself.

3166
02:36:33,620 --> 02:36:35,680
Wait, what does an almond look like?

3167
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:38,500
Almond.

3168
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:42,260
Oh, see this one looks like a nut.

3169
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:44,060
This one looks so normal.

3170
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:46,240
This one looks...

3171
02:36:47,580 --> 02:36:48,780
It's kind of fuzzy.

3172
02:36:49,620 --> 02:36:50,720
Looks normal.

3173
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:52,720
Normal nut.

3174
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:53,580
Normal nut.

3175
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:55,340
Nothing...

3176
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:56,020
No big deal.

3177
02:36:56,100 --> 02:36:57,000
Normal nut.

3178
02:36:58,220 --> 02:36:59,180
NBD, NBD.

3179
02:37:06,540 --> 02:37:08,740
Zucchini is actually prettier when you see it.

3180
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:11,400
Zucchini...

3181
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:14,160
Can't zucchinis have flowers on them?

3182
02:37:14,220 --> 02:37:14,920
Or am I lying?

3183
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:21,060
Oh, I want some zucchini now.

3184
02:37:21,700 --> 02:37:22,720
I'm kind of hungry.

3185
02:37:23,220 --> 02:37:24,320
Oh my gosh, I just...

3186
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:25,880
I just realized I haven't had dinner.

3187
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:28,220
I can do a few more.

3188
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:30,180
Zucchinis look normal.

3189
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:34,220
Normal nut, normal nut.

3190
02:37:37,420 --> 02:37:39,200
Okay, let me find a cashew.

3191
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:45,000
Cashew nut.

3192
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:49,320
Oh my god.

3193
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:50,840
It's so gross.

3194
02:37:51,220 --> 02:37:53,060
It's so nasty.

3195
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:54,840
Sorry, cashew.

3196
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:56,040
I'm not calling you nasty.

3197
02:37:56,040 --> 02:37:58,640
I'm calling your baby pictures nasty.

3198
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:07,020
Why can't I find just a singular nut?

3199
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:09,060
Cashew nut.

3200
02:38:15,820 --> 02:38:16,740
Cashew nut.

3201
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:24,340
Cashew nut.

3202
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:25,020
Cashew nut.

3203
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:25,040
Cashew nut.

3204
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:25,100
Cashew nut.

3205
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:25,300
Cashew nut.

3206
02:38:25,300 --> 02:38:25,980
Cashew nut.

3207
02:38:28,580 --> 02:38:29,500
Cashew nut.

3208
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:35,480
Cashew nut.

3209
02:38:35,480 --> 02:38:37,120
Okay, perfect.

3210
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:42,040
Alright, now we're gonna draw him onto this nut.

3211
02:38:43,220 --> 02:38:44,480
Why is it glistening?

3212
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:45,460
It's oily.

3213
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:49,680
Cashews have oil on them.

3214
02:38:50,220 --> 02:38:52,040
A little bit at least, don't they?

3215
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:53,460
It's like a cashew oil.

3216
02:38:54,380 --> 02:38:56,100
Okay, let's start with his hair.

3217
02:39:00,480 --> 02:39:01,000
Wait.

3218
02:39:16,660 --> 02:39:18,480
This is so anime.

3219
02:39:19,380 --> 02:39:21,400
This is what I feel like I drew as a kid.

3220
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:24,020
Like this kind of hairstyle.

3221
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:29,700
This is like the hairstyle I drew as a kid.

3222
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:32,540
When I was like, oh I'm gonna be an anime artist.

3223
02:39:36,660 --> 02:39:39,440
Anime nut, anime nut, anime nut.

3224
02:39:41,660 --> 02:39:43,160
More likely than you think.

3225
02:39:43,620 --> 02:39:45,780
We're gonna cover up his little pooper right there.

3226
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:48,040
Right there, okay.

3227
02:39:50,520 --> 02:39:52,620
Indecent, indecent, indecent, indecent.

3228
02:39:53,260 --> 02:39:53,800
Whoops.

3229
02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:55,460
Oh, oh he's back.

3230
02:39:58,270 --> 02:39:58,540
Okay.

3231
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:09,740
It's a nut, it's a nut, it's a nut, it's a nut.

3232
02:40:10,420 --> 02:40:11,280
It's a nut.

3233
02:40:11,300 --> 02:40:11,860
Oh, hi Hana!

3234
02:40:13,380 --> 02:40:15,300
It's a nut, it's a nut.

3235
02:40:16,280 --> 02:40:17,320
It's a nut.

3236
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:22,920
It's a...

3237
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:23,940
What's a nut with you!

3238
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:36,540
Oh man, I'm the best at jokes.

3239
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:41,400
I'm so good at jokes you guys.

3240
02:40:48,100 --> 02:40:48,960
Not much.

3241
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:50,240
How about you guys?

3242
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:51,320
Not much.

3243
02:40:51,500 --> 02:40:52,400
How about you?

3244
02:40:54,060 --> 02:40:55,160
Nacho cheese!

3245
02:41:16,940 --> 02:41:18,040
Busting a nut!

3246
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:18,680
No!

3247
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:21,360
Save the nuts!

3248
02:41:21,460 --> 02:41:22,140
Save the nuts!

3249
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:24,720
Don't beat them up.

3250
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:27,440
Don't bust them up.

3251
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:31,240
Bust a move instead of busting a nut.

3252
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:37,560
Oh my gosh, I knew you guys would love it.

3253
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:38,760
I knew you guys would love it.

3254
02:41:54,470 --> 02:41:56,550
Oh no, it looks too awesome.

3255
02:41:59,370 --> 02:42:01,310
It looks just like him, doesn't it?

3256
02:42:02,850 --> 02:42:04,370
It honestly looks so good.

3257
02:42:08,690 --> 02:42:10,250
It honestly looks so good.

3258
02:42:11,710 --> 02:42:13,050
It kind of feels like him.

3259
02:42:13,070 --> 02:42:19,190
You know how making visual novels of pigeons and weird characters.

3260
02:42:19,610 --> 02:42:20,930
Like the KFC one.

3261
02:42:22,370 --> 02:42:23,530
Busting a nut.

3262
02:42:23,610 --> 02:42:24,770
Mint Fantomo.

3263
02:42:24,890 --> 02:42:25,930
Stop my name!

3264
02:42:29,070 --> 02:42:29,710
Like...

3265
02:42:30,970 --> 02:42:31,610
Like...

3266
02:42:32,270 --> 02:42:33,710
Yeah, like the...

3267
02:42:33,710 --> 02:42:35,170
What's the word?

3268
02:42:35,790 --> 02:42:36,870
The KFC one.

3269
02:42:36,950 --> 02:42:39,370
I feel like there would be one about nuts and cash.

3270
02:42:39,650 --> 02:42:41,950
This is Kashukun.

3271
02:42:41,950 --> 02:42:42,050
Or KFC.

3272
02:42:42,050 --> 02:42:42,910
You know?

3273
02:42:45,590 --> 02:42:49,490
And their catchphrase is like, Nothing wrong about it.

3274
02:42:51,170 --> 02:42:52,330
Dating a nut.

3275
02:42:52,390 --> 02:42:53,950
Nothing wrong about it.

3276
02:42:57,570 --> 02:42:58,390
Nothing wrong

3277
02:43:02,160 --> 02:43:09,000
about it.

3278
02:43:14,130 --> 02:43:14,810
Noo!

3279
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:15,790
Noooo!

3280
02:43:17,810 --> 02:43:19,050
Pics that go hard.

3281
02:43:19,310 --> 02:43:22,070
This might be my magnum opus of profile pictures.

3282
02:43:22,210 --> 02:43:25,030
I don't know if I can do another one after this one.

3283
02:43:25,070 --> 02:43:25,690
It's too good.

3284
02:43:27,210 --> 02:43:29,430
Okay, I'm normal.

3285
02:43:29,610 --> 02:43:30,110
I'm normal.

3286
02:43:30,230 --> 02:43:30,770
I'm normal.

3287
02:43:31,450 --> 02:43:32,270
I'm normal.

3288
02:43:32,370 --> 02:43:32,910
I'm normal.

3289
02:43:32,910 --> 02:43:33,350
I'm normal.

3290
02:43:33,630 --> 02:43:35,570
I'm not normal.

3291
02:43:35,630 --> 02:43:38,470
I'm thinking about my nut husband.

3292
02:43:42,250 --> 02:43:45,790
People would be actually discussing, like, who's the hottest nut.

3293
02:43:47,410 --> 02:43:48,930
Be like, oh my gosh.

3294
02:43:52,910 --> 02:43:59,770
There's something so sexy about how brooding... how brooding Pistachio is.

3295
02:44:01,970 --> 02:44:03,850
They'd be like, he's so kakui.

3296
02:44:04,790 --> 02:44:05,370
Wow.

3297
02:44:05,790 --> 02:44:07,190
Wait, this doesn't look right.

3298
02:44:07,290 --> 02:44:07,570
Hold on.

3299
02:44:08,470 --> 02:44:10,430
Okay, let's... I'm just gonna draw this for now.

3300
02:44:11,010 --> 02:44:12,250
And the other opening.

3301
02:44:12,770 --> 02:44:14,190
I'm only gonna give the jacket.

3302
02:44:14,290 --> 02:44:14,730
No pants.

3303
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:17,070
This guy is too sexy for pants.

3304
02:44:32,450 --> 02:44:33,570
Kinda like that.

3305
02:44:34,910 --> 02:44:35,650
She's normal.

3306
02:44:35,790 --> 02:44:36,190
She's normal.

3307
02:44:36,250 --> 02:44:36,770
I'm normal.

3308
02:44:36,910 --> 02:44:37,310
I'm normal.

3309
02:44:37,490 --> 02:44:37,830
I'm normal.

3310
02:44:44,300 --> 02:44:46,320
I can't... I can't draw a perspective.

3311
02:44:46,460 --> 02:44:47,080
I'm so sorry.

3312
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:52,680
Like, I'm trying to follow the art... the picture itself, but...

3313
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:54,680
I think my perspective is wrong.

3314
02:44:55,800 --> 02:44:58,220
I need to go back to art school.

3315
02:45:00,980 --> 02:45:02,960
Like I totally ever went before.

3316
02:45:03,820 --> 02:45:05,560
Your magna opus.

3317
02:45:08,600 --> 02:45:10,500
Yo, this PFP is packing.

3318
02:45:10,740 --> 02:45:11,680
That's what I'm saying.

3319
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:12,320
It's really good.

3320
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:14,600
And he's gotta get his shirt on.

3321
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:17,520
He's got his little shirt.

3322
02:45:18,140 --> 02:45:20,440
His little green shirt.

3323
02:45:21,640 --> 02:45:22,480
And

3324
02:45:28,260 --> 02:45:28,580
then...

3325
02:45:28,580 --> 02:45:30,840
I'll do the belt down here.

3326
02:45:40,460 --> 02:45:42,240
There we go.

3327
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:47,800
And then...

3328
02:45:50,980 --> 02:45:51,820
200k!

3329
02:45:53,400 --> 02:45:54,800
We did it!

3330
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:56,700
Let's go!

3331
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,140
Let's not...

3332
02:45:58,140 --> 02:45:58,360
Let's not go!

3333
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:00,920
Bust a nut!

3334
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:01,780
Bust a nut!

3335
02:46:02,620 --> 02:46:03,080
Let's go!

3336
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:07,080
Thank you guys!

3337
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:08,680
Thank you for 200k!

3338
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:09,800
Thank you!

3339
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:13,220
Thank you guys so much!

3340
02:46:16,500 --> 02:46:17,300
Thank you!

3341
02:46:19,780 --> 02:46:20,400
Oh gosh.

3342
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:21,920
My chat is... Oh, fake me!

3343
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:22,540
Oh my gosh.

3344
02:46:22,620 --> 02:46:23,220
Thank you for the...

3345
02:46:23,680 --> 02:46:24,780
Thank you so much!

3346
02:46:24,840 --> 02:46:25,200
Thank you!

3347
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:26,520
Oh my gosh.

3348
02:46:26,560 --> 02:46:27,220
Thank you so much.

3349
02:46:27,780 --> 02:46:28,220
Please.

3350
02:46:28,420 --> 02:46:28,920
It's okay.

3351
02:46:30,860 --> 02:46:32,020
Thank you so much!

3352
02:46:34,460 --> 02:46:36,140
Ignore this part right here, okay?

3353
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:36,640
Ignore that.

3354
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:38,980
This is how you get 200k subs.

3355
02:46:39,380 --> 02:46:39,820
200k!

3356
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:41,760
Thank you!

3357
02:46:42,140 --> 02:46:42,860
Oh my gosh.

3358
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:43,920
Brick, thank you for the 50!

3359
02:46:44,140 --> 02:46:46,520
Wait, my chat is really... really delayed.

3360
02:46:48,600 --> 02:46:50,640
I have to do something for...

3361
02:46:51,160 --> 02:46:53,520
I still have to do something for...

3362
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:56,100
Well, I have to think of something to do for 200k.

3363
02:46:56,200 --> 02:46:56,600
Oh gosh.

3364
02:46:57,700 --> 02:46:59,140
Thank you guys so much!

3365
02:46:59,140 --> 02:46:59,600
Thank you!

3366
02:47:00,840 --> 02:47:02,060
Thank you so much!

3367
02:47:02,620 --> 02:47:03,060
200k!

3368
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:04,720
Wow!

3369
02:47:06,540 --> 02:47:06,980
Wow!

3370
02:47:07,500 --> 02:47:09,280
We'll do something... Oh gosh, wait.

3371
02:47:09,360 --> 02:47:12,340
Do I have to readjust my schedule for next week then?

3372
02:47:17,300 --> 02:47:18,760
I might have to.

3373
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:20,480
I didn't have anything planned.

3374
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:21,180
Uh oh.

3375
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:23,680
Okay, I might have to move some stuff around.

3376
02:47:24,620 --> 02:47:25,620
What should I do?

3377
02:47:31,420 --> 02:47:32,640
Bustin' out to 200k!

3378
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:33,180
Woo!

3379
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:36,120
Let's go!

3380
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:43,280
I have to think of something to do.

3381
02:47:43,660 --> 02:47:45,320
I don't want to just do a karaoke.

3382
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:49,060
Congratulations!

3383
02:47:50,060 --> 02:47:50,500
Arigato!

3384
02:47:52,480 --> 02:47:52,960
Arigato!

3385
02:47:53,300 --> 02:47:53,420
Arigato!

3386
02:47:53,820 --> 02:47:54,300
Arigato!

3387
02:47:54,300 --> 02:47:54,380
Uwa!

3388
02:47:54,540 --> 02:47:54,880
Uwa!

3389
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:56,320
Pyrobug, thanks for the akasubo!

3390
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:58,240
Oh my gosh, my chat is so...

3391
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:00,000
I have to like, read chat through OBS.

3392
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:02,240
It is so broken on the computer.

3393
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:04,440
It is so broken.

3394
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:07,360
But thank you, I'm hoping I'm seeing the messages.

3395
02:48:07,600 --> 02:48:08,100
I'm hoping.

3396
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:13,380
If I'm a little slow, it's because of...

3397
02:48:13,380 --> 02:48:14,300
It's because of...

3398
02:48:15,020 --> 02:48:16,720
It's because YouTube chat on...

3399
02:48:17,400 --> 02:48:17,880
On...

3400
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:19,660
Browser is breaking.

3401
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:20,560
Browser is breaking.

3402
02:48:21,580 --> 02:48:22,700
Thank you!

3403
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:24,000
Wait.

3404
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:25,140
Hold on.

3405
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:26,120
Wait.

3406
02:48:26,240 --> 02:48:27,180
I couldn't...

3407
02:48:27,180 --> 02:48:27,900
I couldn't read it.

3408
02:48:27,940 --> 02:48:28,500
It was too small.

3409
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:31,560
It'll...

3410
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:32,600
It'll appear eventually.

3411
02:48:32,860 --> 02:48:33,620
In browser.

3412
02:48:35,900 --> 02:48:37,200
Nut tier list?

3413
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:39,060
No!

3414
02:48:41,700 --> 02:48:43,940
This isn't a very pretty color.

3415
02:48:44,300 --> 02:48:45,560
I'm gonna make it more yellow.

3416
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:47,760
Oh, there it is!

3417
02:48:47,960 --> 02:48:50,260
Oh, thank you for the big akadono!

3418
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:52,560
Congrats on busting over 200k!

3419
02:48:52,740 --> 02:48:54,520
Thank you!

3420
02:48:56,060 --> 02:48:57,560
Thank you guys!

3421
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:01,480
Thank you so much!

3422
02:49:04,100 --> 02:49:05,300
Thank you guys!

3423
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:06,040
Thank you!

3424
02:49:06,220 --> 02:49:06,920
There we go.

3425
02:49:12,300 --> 02:49:13,080
There we go!

3426
02:49:13,140 --> 02:49:15,360
That should be good for your profile picture, right?

3427
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:19,280
Cashews, here you are!

3428
02:49:19,280 --> 02:49:20,100
Oh, wait.

3429
02:49:20,180 --> 02:49:20,820
Let me write your name.

3430
02:49:21,100 --> 02:49:21,500
Wait.

3431
02:49:21,580 --> 02:49:22,740
Was it cashews or cashew?

3432
02:49:25,860 --> 02:49:26,260
Cashews.

3433
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:29,260
Julian, thanks for the vibe gifted!

3434
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:30,940
Thank you for the...

3435
02:49:30,940 --> 02:49:32,360
Thank you!

3436
02:49:35,980 --> 02:49:36,720
Oh my gosh.

3437
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:38,560
Thank you for all the super chats!

3438
02:49:38,740 --> 02:49:39,880
It is so delayed.

3439
02:49:40,020 --> 02:49:40,720
I'm so sorry.

3440
02:49:46,720 --> 02:49:47,300
Oh yeah.

3441
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:48,460
Oh yeah.

3442
02:49:48,860 --> 02:49:49,260
Oh yeah.

3443
02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:50,080
Wait.

3444
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:53,320
I'm trying to draw it along as luscious curves.

3445
02:50:00,730 --> 02:50:01,370
There we go.

3446
02:50:03,410 --> 02:50:04,490
There you go, cashews!

3447
02:50:05,490 --> 02:50:07,210
I think this one is my best one yet.

3448
02:50:07,250 --> 02:50:07,490
Maybe.

3449
02:50:07,710 --> 02:50:09,330
Sorry that the color is a little weird.

3450
02:50:09,350 --> 02:50:09,990
Just ignore it.

3451
02:50:10,810 --> 02:50:11,690
Nobody will sell.

3452
02:50:11,830 --> 02:50:12,630
Nobody will see it.

3453
02:50:12,730 --> 02:50:13,630
It'll be too small.

3454
02:50:16,110 --> 02:50:17,410
Congrats on 200k!

3455
02:50:17,470 --> 02:50:18,290
Thank you!

3456
02:50:18,690 --> 02:50:19,410
Thank you guys!

3457
02:50:21,270 --> 02:50:22,850
Crooked Matter, thanks for the vibe gifted!

3458
02:50:22,990 --> 02:50:23,650
Oh, gifted!

3459
02:50:23,830 --> 02:50:23,970
Thank you!

3460
02:50:25,530 --> 02:50:26,010
Thank you guys!

3461
02:50:26,010 --> 02:50:26,690
Oath, Warm, Jeb!

3462
02:50:27,070 --> 02:50:27,810
Thank you!

3463
02:50:30,430 --> 02:50:34,610
Do you think you'd consider doing mid-day Minecraft and miss listening to it at work?

3464
02:50:34,830 --> 02:50:36,270
I definitely want to.

3465
02:50:36,290 --> 02:50:38,130
I just want to be in a server, maybe.

3466
02:50:38,530 --> 02:50:44,110
I can still probably be on a... on a private... private thing.

3467
02:50:44,510 --> 02:50:46,350
Mike, thanks for the 100!

3468
02:50:46,870 --> 02:50:48,150
Thank you for the 아까 살다!

3469
02:50:49,210 --> 02:50:50,210
Congrats on 200k!

3470
02:50:50,290 --> 02:50:50,930
You spooky ghost!

3471
02:50:51,030 --> 02:50:51,630
Thank you!

3472
02:50:51,650 --> 02:50:52,790
Thank you so much!

3473
02:50:52,950 --> 02:50:53,510
Oh my gosh.

3474
02:50:53,530 --> 02:50:53,950
Thank you guys!

3475
02:51:02,650 --> 02:51:04,510
It really is the best one.

3476
02:51:04,670 --> 02:51:06,390
I think this one is my best one.

3477
02:51:10,990 --> 02:51:12,690
Oh my gosh, PhD killers!

3478
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:14,750
Thanks for 6 months membership!

3479
02:51:15,050 --> 02:51:16,910
To a hundred thousand, oh my god!

3480
02:51:18,070 --> 02:51:19,230
6 months ago!

3481
02:51:19,910 --> 02:51:20,930
I was not!

3482
02:51:21,230 --> 02:51:23,250
I was at like 10k!

3483
02:51:25,150 --> 02:51:26,290
Now I'm back.

3484
02:51:26,830 --> 02:51:28,830
And I just hit 200k!

3485
02:51:31,790 --> 02:51:32,310
Crazy.

3486
02:51:32,310 --> 02:51:33,550
Crazy, crazy, crazy.

3487
02:51:34,170 --> 02:51:35,270
Oh, one block!

3488
02:51:35,490 --> 02:51:36,790
I do like one block.

3489
02:51:39,950 --> 02:51:40,470
No!

3490
02:51:40,470 --> 02:51:41,250
Thank you!

3491
02:51:42,030 --> 02:51:43,650
200k, let's go bust a nut!

3492
02:51:44,750 --> 02:51:47,650
Marilyn, thank you for the 5 gifted!

3493
02:51:48,330 --> 02:51:48,850
Misakuchi!

3494
02:51:53,250 --> 02:51:54,350
Thank you for the 10!

3495
02:51:54,490 --> 02:51:55,770
I love your profile picture!

3496
02:52:00,090 --> 02:52:01,690
Oh my gosh...

3497
02:52:02,250 --> 02:52:04,810
Here's to 300k next, I'll do my best.

3498
02:52:05,990 --> 02:52:10,510
I'll do my best to be entertaining enough for 300k!

3499
02:52:11,790 --> 02:52:14,010
Alright, Cashews, I hope you screencapped it.

3500
02:52:14,790 --> 02:52:15,710
Cha-chow!

3501
02:52:17,270 --> 02:52:19,350
I'll do 2 more.

3502
02:52:26,710 --> 02:52:28,370
1 million before the end of the year?

3503
02:52:28,430 --> 02:52:30,810
Actually impossible, but thank you for your high hopes.

3504
02:52:32,130 --> 02:52:32,530
Yuki!

3505
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:33,730
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

3506
02:52:33,850 --> 02:52:34,290
Thank you!

3507
02:52:34,790 --> 02:52:35,410
Thank you!

3508
02:52:35,470 --> 02:52:36,950
Oh my god, the claps are for me!

3509
02:52:37,390 --> 02:52:38,510
The claps are for me!

3510
02:52:38,630 --> 02:52:39,710
Next person is...

3511
02:52:41,090 --> 02:52:41,490
Alaric!

3512
02:52:42,510 --> 02:52:44,550
Alaric, if you're here, congratulations!

3513
02:52:47,390 --> 02:52:47,790
Congratulations!

3514
02:52:49,410 --> 02:52:50,310
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3515
02:52:50,990 --> 02:52:51,390
Undo?

3516
02:52:56,330 --> 02:52:56,950
Uh...

3517
02:52:59,210 --> 02:53:00,010
Oh, wait.

3518
02:53:00,190 --> 02:53:00,930
Uh-oh.

3519
02:53:05,550 --> 02:53:07,310
You entered twice!

3520
02:53:12,090 --> 02:53:12,710
Alaric...

3521
02:53:13,250 --> 02:53:13,770
Wait, what?

3522
02:53:13,850 --> 02:53:14,090
No.

3523
02:53:14,290 --> 02:53:15,750
Alaric, you entered twice!

3524
02:53:17,250 --> 02:53:18,370
What is this?

3525
02:53:18,770 --> 02:53:19,890
I'm kinda scared.

3526
02:53:20,230 --> 02:53:21,270
You sent a picture.

3527
02:53:22,350 --> 02:53:24,030
Or a link to a picture.

3528
02:53:30,350 --> 02:53:31,650
Alaric, you entered twice!

3529
02:53:31,950 --> 02:53:33,210
Why did you enter twice?

3530
02:53:35,610 --> 02:53:38,190
You asked for the same thing both times!

3531
02:53:39,910 --> 02:53:41,290
I saw you were in chat.

3532
02:53:41,470 --> 02:53:42,610
What do you have to say for yourself?

3533
02:53:45,350 --> 02:53:46,050
Shame him.

3534
02:53:46,190 --> 02:53:46,690
I am.

3535
02:53:48,710 --> 02:53:49,990
What do you have to...

3536
02:53:49,990 --> 02:53:52,310
What do you have to say for yourself?

3537
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:01,380
This is like...

3538
02:54:02,620 --> 02:54:04,400
I kinda wanna draw this, though.

3539
02:54:04,520 --> 02:54:05,740
Which is why I'm...

3540
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:16,060
Where did you go?

3541
02:54:16,280 --> 02:54:17,740
I can't tell if you've...

3542
02:54:17,740 --> 02:54:19,140
I didn't mean to?

3543
02:54:20,780 --> 02:54:22,940
What do you mean you didn't mean to?

3544
02:54:23,560 --> 02:54:24,700
What do you mean?

3545
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:27,240
Okay.

3546
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:30,300
Because you entered twice.

3547
02:54:31,440 --> 02:54:32,540
I will...

3548
02:54:33,260 --> 02:54:34,700
I will still do it.

3549
02:54:35,780 --> 02:54:37,640
But I will set a timer.

3550
02:54:38,100 --> 02:54:39,800
Where I only have...

3551
02:54:40,480 --> 02:54:41,880
One minute to draw it.

3552
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:45,360
And the thing you asked me to draw is...

3553
02:54:48,720 --> 02:54:49,320
But...

3554
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:49,960
But...

3555
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:50,760
Peculiar things are the gifted.

3556
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:11,700
Oh my god, I don't want this person's butt on my screen so large.

3557
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:16,760
What is the context of this photo?

3558
02:55:16,880 --> 02:55:17,820
Actually, I don't want to know.

3559
02:55:22,860 --> 02:55:24,480
I don't even know what this is.

3560
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:26,980
But I'm going to give myself one minute.

3561
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:34,440
To draw this.

3562
02:55:36,340 --> 02:55:40,320
And starting now.

3563
02:56:48,950 --> 02:56:49,750
Time.

3564
02:56:56,500 --> 02:56:58,640
Just boys being boys.

3565
02:56:59,940 --> 02:57:01,280
Congrats on 200k!

3566
02:57:01,420 --> 02:57:02,340
Thank you!

3567
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:04,480
Thank you!

3568
02:57:05,540 --> 02:57:07,180
This is the horse.

3569
02:57:08,280 --> 02:57:09,480
By the way.

3570
02:57:09,900 --> 02:57:11,440
The one right here.

3571
02:57:13,320 --> 02:57:14,260
That's that guy.

3572
02:57:15,940 --> 02:57:16,920
That's the horse.

3573
02:57:18,040 --> 02:57:18,660
What's up!

3574
02:57:19,080 --> 02:57:20,280
Thanks for the five gifted.

3575
02:57:20,300 --> 02:57:20,880
Thank you so much!

3576
02:57:21,660 --> 02:57:23,640
I think I actually got it pretty well.

3577
02:57:24,220 --> 02:57:26,040
I think I got it pretty well actually.

3578
02:57:27,760 --> 02:57:28,800
Let me write your name.

3579
02:57:36,560 --> 02:57:42,060
It's less of a profile pic because it's kind of more portrait style.

3580
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:43,780
But I did my best.

3581
02:57:45,360 --> 02:57:45,960
Sorry.

3582
02:57:46,340 --> 02:57:48,180
I'm not going to color it in.

3583
02:57:48,360 --> 02:57:51,620
Because I sped running.

3584
02:57:52,040 --> 02:57:54,220
I call this one Metal Gear.

3585
02:57:57,160 --> 02:57:58,600
Yeah, everybody's watching.

3586
02:57:58,680 --> 02:57:59,300
They're enjoying.

3587
02:58:00,020 --> 02:58:01,540
I think this one's pretty good.

3588
02:58:04,140 --> 02:58:05,020
Oh, hold on.

3589
02:58:05,160 --> 02:58:06,680
I did forget this one.

3590
02:58:07,280 --> 02:58:07,940
That's it!

3591
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:11,240
There's his other arm.

3592
02:58:12,860 --> 02:58:14,160
He's giving him a head pat.

3593
02:58:17,540 --> 02:58:19,400
He's giving him a head pat obviously.

3594
02:58:20,860 --> 02:58:21,580
There we go.

3595
02:58:28,630 --> 02:58:29,110
Stretch.

3596
02:58:30,550 --> 02:58:31,030
Okay.

3597
02:58:31,390 --> 02:58:32,850
This belongs in a museum.

3598
02:58:33,150 --> 02:58:34,310
It belongs in a museum.

3599
02:58:34,750 --> 02:58:35,690
Thank you, Indy.

3600
02:58:36,370 --> 02:58:36,850
Okay.

3601
02:58:37,350 --> 02:58:38,210
Next one.

3602
02:58:39,370 --> 02:58:40,730
Which might be the last one.

3603
02:58:40,770 --> 02:58:43,510
We'll see how in depth it is.

3604
02:58:45,190 --> 02:58:45,950
We'll see.

3605
02:58:55,880 --> 02:58:59,680
Congratulations to Manthy Rose.

3606
02:59:00,720 --> 02:59:01,520
Manthy Rose.

3607
02:59:01,560 --> 02:59:01,980
Manthy Rose.

3608
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:02,980
If you're here.

3609
02:59:03,640 --> 02:59:07,660
Let's see what you've got.

3610
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:08,240
Whoa.

3611
02:59:08,880 --> 02:59:09,780
Oh my gosh.

3612
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:11,900
My preview of my stream.

3613
02:59:12,200 --> 02:59:16,060
There's a little preview for YouTube.

3614
02:59:16,060 --> 02:59:20,140
It showed me just getting rid of the Gundam guy.

3615
02:59:20,560 --> 02:59:21,280
That's crazy.

3616
02:59:25,020 --> 02:59:28,520
A Wisp version of my OC in the profile pic.

3617
02:59:30,480 --> 02:59:31,820
Manthy, I sure hope you're here.

3618
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:35,680
I sure hope you're here, Manthy.

3619
02:59:38,020 --> 02:59:38,500
Because...

3620
02:59:39,940 --> 02:59:40,420
Raiders?

3621
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:41,200
Oh, hello.

3622
02:59:41,460 --> 02:59:42,440
Thanks for the raid.

3623
02:59:42,720 --> 02:59:43,380
Hello, hello.

3624
02:59:44,100 --> 02:59:45,540
Whoever raided me, thank you.

3625
02:59:46,420 --> 02:59:48,720
Sorry, my chat's a little broken right now.

3626
02:59:48,760 --> 02:59:49,220
I can't...

3627
02:59:50,200 --> 02:59:51,200
I can't see.

3628
02:59:54,940 --> 02:59:55,560
Oh, he's here?

3629
02:59:55,780 --> 02:59:56,260
I'm here!

3630
02:59:56,460 --> 02:59:57,200
Oh my gosh.

3631
02:59:57,260 --> 02:59:57,480
Wait.

3632
03:00:00,380 --> 03:00:01,180
Hold on.

3633
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:05,720
Where are you?

3634
03:00:07,440 --> 03:00:07,980
Hold on.

3635
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:08,320
I'm looking.

3636
03:00:13,400 --> 03:00:14,260
Don't worry, guys.

3637
03:00:14,360 --> 03:00:15,480
I will be doing this again.

3638
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:17,320
I hope you guys like this style.

3639
03:00:17,320 --> 03:00:18,460
I just feel like it's...

3640
03:00:18,460 --> 03:00:21,020
Like I said, it's less overwhelming for me.

3641
03:00:21,200 --> 03:00:24,360
And also gives other people a shot.

3642
03:00:24,940 --> 03:00:29,500
Even though I appreciate every single one of you and everybody who...

3643
03:00:29,500 --> 03:00:30,820
I never win.

3644
03:00:30,920 --> 03:00:31,180
Yippee!

3645
03:00:32,580 --> 03:00:33,180
See?

3646
03:00:34,320 --> 03:00:35,260
I just...

3647
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:40,520
I want everybody to have a chance.

3648
03:00:43,600 --> 03:00:44,200
So...

3649
03:00:44,200 --> 03:00:46,380
Manthy, I can't tell what your...

3650
03:00:46,380 --> 03:00:46,500
Wait.

3651
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:51,800
Manthy, can you post your profile picture under the MintoLive hashtag?

3652
03:00:51,920 --> 03:00:53,020
And I'll just get it from there.

3653
03:00:58,400 --> 03:01:00,020
Oh, it looks like a Vtuber.

3654
03:01:00,240 --> 03:01:00,400
Ah!

3655
03:01:02,480 --> 03:01:03,520
Here I am!

3656
03:01:03,560 --> 03:01:04,280
I see you!

3657
03:01:04,720 --> 03:01:05,440
Kind of.

3658
03:01:05,440 --> 03:01:06,840
My chat is so slow.

3659
03:01:06,980 --> 03:01:08,020
I don't know what's going on.

3660
03:01:08,160 --> 03:01:08,760
I think it's YouTube.

3661
03:01:10,480 --> 03:01:11,540
Maybe I should refresh.

3662
03:01:14,980 --> 03:01:15,580
Refresh.

3663
03:01:16,500 --> 03:01:16,800
Refresh.

3664
03:01:28,580 --> 03:01:29,520
There you are.

3665
03:01:32,360 --> 03:01:34,400
I'm gonna go check my hashtag.

3666
03:01:38,140 --> 03:01:39,820
W2taxmore picture the five gifted!

3667
03:01:40,200 --> 03:01:41,460
Sorry if I...

3668
03:01:43,160 --> 03:01:46,000
Sorry if I missed it earlier.

3669
03:01:46,460 --> 03:01:48,280
Chat was being so icky.

3670
03:01:48,380 --> 03:01:49,920
I can't read anything.

3671
03:02:05,610 --> 03:02:08,610
I'm looking at everything that's in the file.

3672
03:02:08,690 --> 03:02:13,030
The live tag and it's so cursed.

3673
03:02:15,030 --> 03:02:16,730
Oh my gosh.

3674
03:02:20,170 --> 03:02:21,190
We aren't icky.

3675
03:02:21,310 --> 03:02:22,310
Oh, I think it's fixed now.

3676
03:02:22,410 --> 03:02:23,070
I think it's fixed.

3677
03:02:24,570 --> 03:02:25,770
I think it's fixed now.

3678
03:02:25,830 --> 03:02:26,470
I think it's fixed.

3679
03:02:28,850 --> 03:02:31,310
So Maple, why did you... Oh, I see it.

3680
03:02:31,410 --> 03:02:32,070
Oh, there it is.

3681
03:02:32,490 --> 03:02:33,210
Thank you.

3682
03:02:33,450 --> 03:02:34,270
Oh, they're so pretty.

3683
03:02:38,630 --> 03:02:41,710
Is it okay if I... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna put it on the screen.

3684
03:02:42,010 --> 03:02:42,590
I hope that's okay.

3685
03:02:47,290 --> 03:02:48,770
So that I can have a reference.

3686
03:02:49,270 --> 03:02:50,410
Easy to see reference.

3687
03:02:51,250 --> 03:02:52,390
Maple, why did you draw?

3688
03:02:52,610 --> 03:02:55,950
Why did you draw yourself as... as... with a... with a...

3689
03:02:57,370 --> 03:02:58,250
You made me.

3690
03:02:58,290 --> 03:02:58,870
Thanks for the raid.

3691
03:02:58,950 --> 03:02:59,330
Thank you.

3692
03:03:00,510 --> 03:03:01,330
Thank you so much.

3693
03:03:01,330 --> 03:03:01,530
Hello.

3694
03:03:02,070 --> 03:03:02,590
Hello everybody.

3695
03:03:04,850 --> 03:03:11,230
Oh, he lost one ear.

3696
03:03:13,490 --> 03:03:13,970
Alright.

3697
03:03:17,190 --> 03:03:19,410
Why are there so many people raiding me?

3698
03:03:19,870 --> 03:03:20,810
What's going on?

3699
03:03:25,230 --> 03:03:26,450
Thank you for the raid.

3700
03:03:26,630 --> 03:03:27,090
Hello.

3701
03:03:27,770 --> 03:03:28,850
What is going on?

3702
03:03:28,910 --> 03:03:30,250
Why are there so many people raiding me?

3703
03:03:36,940 --> 03:03:37,780
What's happening?

3704
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:47,080
I'm in my popular fires.

3705
03:03:51,020 --> 03:03:51,460
What?

3706
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:53,860
Okay, there we go.

3707
03:03:56,160 --> 03:03:57,520
Big and bulbous.

3708
03:03:59,060 --> 03:04:01,600
For anybody coming in, I'm drawing profile pictures.

3709
03:04:03,800 --> 03:04:04,920
Nothing too fancy.

3710
03:04:04,920 --> 03:04:06,320
We're just kind of chit-chatting.

3711
03:04:06,340 --> 03:04:07,140
We're just hanging out.

3712
03:04:07,500 --> 03:04:08,280
Hey, I'm Dragon.

3713
03:04:08,400 --> 03:04:09,420
Thanks for the 10 gift tips.

3714
03:04:09,620 --> 03:04:09,960
Hey, don't try.

3715
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:10,360
Thanks for the 10 gift tips.

3716
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:12,000
Thank you guys.

3717
03:04:12,220 --> 03:04:12,840
Thank you.

3718
03:04:13,340 --> 03:04:14,640
Thank you so much.

3719
03:04:15,020 --> 03:04:15,800
Thank you.

3720
03:04:18,200 --> 03:04:19,280
Oh, perfect.

3721
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:20,040
Okay.

3722
03:04:29,920 --> 03:04:32,920
First, we'll start off with our cat.

3723
03:04:33,500 --> 03:04:34,400
Our wisp.

3724
03:04:35,520 --> 03:04:39,280
And then you got a little hat, so I definitely want to draw that.

3725
03:04:42,260 --> 03:04:44,060
Oh, and the hair ribbon too.

3726
03:04:49,260 --> 03:04:50,540
I'll draw the hair ribbon.

3727
03:04:51,240 --> 03:04:52,840
It does kind of look like a toho.

3728
03:04:59,440 --> 03:05:00,640
Art by Mint.

3729
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:01,500
That's me.

3730
03:05:01,700 --> 03:05:02,500
That's my name.

3731
03:05:02,880 --> 03:05:03,880
My name's Mint.

3732
03:05:04,380 --> 03:05:05,120
I'm Minto.

3733
03:05:06,340 --> 03:05:07,240
That's my name.

3734
03:05:07,260 --> 03:05:08,120
Don't wear it out.

3735
03:05:10,840 --> 03:05:11,740
And the hat.

3736
03:05:32,210 --> 03:05:33,490
I'm so concentrated.

3737
03:05:33,730 --> 03:05:33,890
Okay.

3738
03:05:34,110 --> 03:05:36,010
All right.

3739
03:05:37,050 --> 03:05:38,150
Very good.

3740
03:05:38,610 --> 03:05:40,030
Amazing artwork there.

3741
03:05:42,190 --> 03:05:43,310
Stop it.

3742
03:05:43,450 --> 03:05:45,450
You're just trying to flatter me.

3743
03:05:47,590 --> 03:05:51,830
You're just trying to make me feel good.

3744
03:05:53,530 --> 03:05:54,270
Bustin'.

3745
03:05:54,270 --> 03:05:54,810
Bustin'.

3746
03:05:54,810 --> 03:05:55,180
Bustin'.

3747
03:05:55,180 --> 03:05:55,660
Bustin'.

3748
03:05:55,660 --> 03:05:56,300
Bustin'.

3749
03:05:56,300 --> 03:05:56,700
Bustin'.

3750
03:05:56,700 --> 03:05:56,940
Bustin'.

3751
03:05:56,940 --> 03:05:57,720
Bustin'.

3752
03:05:57,720 --> 03:05:58,420
Bustin'.

3753
03:05:58,420 --> 03:05:58,860
Bustin'.

3754
03:05:58,860 --> 03:05:59,660
Bustin'.

3755
03:06:00,060 --> 03:06:01,640
Bustin' makes me feel good.

3756
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:11,160
Oh, wait.

3757
03:06:12,120 --> 03:06:13,780
I was like, why is it acting weird?

3758
03:06:13,840 --> 03:06:14,140
There we go.

3759
03:06:14,660 --> 03:06:15,720
There we go.

3760
03:06:15,840 --> 03:06:16,360
Perfect.

3761
03:06:16,960 --> 03:06:18,700
Look at this cute little guy.

3762
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:20,380
He's so precious.

3763
03:06:20,540 --> 03:06:21,680
He's so innocent.

3764
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:24,340
Never a bad thought.

3765
03:06:24,400 --> 03:06:25,500
Only good thoughts.

3766
03:06:25,840 --> 03:06:26,480
Oh, wait.

3767
03:06:26,480 --> 03:06:27,000
This is the ears.

3768
03:06:28,300 --> 03:06:29,660
Only good thoughts.

3769
03:06:29,660 --> 03:06:30,780
Never bad thoughts.

3770
03:06:30,780 --> 03:06:33,400
Never weird thoughts.

3771
03:06:34,900 --> 03:06:37,720
Wisps are good and don't have weird thoughts.

3772
03:06:47,370 --> 03:06:48,490
Welcome to membership.

3773
03:06:48,750 --> 03:06:49,790
Thank you so much.

3774
03:06:50,950 --> 03:06:52,250
Yeah, you're normal.

3775
03:06:52,350 --> 03:06:53,030
You're normal.

3776
03:06:53,730 --> 03:06:55,250
You're so normal.

3777
03:06:55,390 --> 03:06:56,470
You're totally normal.

3778
03:07:00,200 --> 03:07:01,120
Right, chat?

3779
03:07:02,430 --> 03:07:03,120
You're normal.

3780
03:07:05,390 --> 03:07:07,380
What was that voice that came out of me?

3781
03:07:08,920 --> 03:07:10,940
I think I am a demon sometimes.

3782
03:07:15,260 --> 03:07:16,220
And the...

3783
03:07:18,800 --> 03:07:20,160
I'm gonna make the heart blue.

3784
03:07:24,400 --> 03:07:25,820
Blue, blue, blue.

3785
03:07:33,640 --> 03:07:34,780
And the ribbon, too.

3786
03:07:40,260 --> 03:07:40,740
Blue.

3787
03:07:43,780 --> 03:07:44,900
Double D, double I.

3788
03:07:45,640 --> 03:07:46,320
I'm blue.

3789
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:47,800
Double D, double I.

3790
03:07:48,560 --> 03:07:50,540
Double D, double I.

3791
03:07:54,200 --> 03:07:57,100
I'm starting to get really hungry, so it's hard for me to think.

3792
03:07:59,240 --> 03:08:01,020
So I apologize...

3793
03:08:02,540 --> 03:08:05,600
for any brain cells lacking in this moment.

3794
03:08:08,840 --> 03:08:11,540
Your art is very amazing and unique and I love it.

3795
03:08:11,560 --> 03:08:12,120
Thank you, Vin.

3796
03:08:13,860 --> 03:08:14,380
Really?

3797
03:08:14,600 --> 03:08:15,840
Well, you don't have to be so nice.

3798
03:08:15,980 --> 03:08:16,500
Come on.

3799
03:08:18,980 --> 03:08:22,260
I think... I think when someone is just like, your art is...

3800
03:08:22,860 --> 03:08:23,380
unique.

3801
03:08:24,400 --> 03:08:26,160
Usually it's like, not a compliment.

3802
03:08:27,520 --> 03:08:29,920
But I appreciate it.

3803
03:08:29,940 --> 03:08:30,420
Thank you.

3804
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:34,760
Yeah, your art is...

3805
03:08:37,440 --> 03:08:38,480
It's unique.

3806
03:08:39,340 --> 03:08:39,860
It's...

3807
03:08:40,800 --> 03:08:41,320
unconventional.

3808
03:08:41,320 --> 03:08:42,160
You know, let's...

3809
03:08:42,160 --> 03:08:44,780
I call it bold and brash.

3810
03:08:45,020 --> 03:08:47,440
Picasso moment, for real.

3811
03:08:48,240 --> 03:08:49,400
Picasso real.

3812
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:51,240
Mint Casso.

3813
03:08:51,960 --> 03:08:52,900
I'm not the Minky.

3814
03:08:53,080 --> 03:08:54,240
I'm Mint Casso.

3815
03:08:55,860 --> 03:08:56,760
That's me.

3816
03:08:57,420 --> 03:08:58,860
Mint Casso.

3817
03:09:00,220 --> 03:09:01,020
Casso.

3818
03:09:05,280 --> 03:09:06,680
Mint Casso.

3819
03:09:15,290 --> 03:09:16,990
Tenginmin let us be nice to you...

3820
03:09:16,990 --> 03:09:17,210
No.

3821
03:09:18,690 --> 03:09:20,290
I don't accept compliments.

3822
03:09:23,470 --> 03:09:24,590
Um, I'm gonna...

3823
03:09:24,590 --> 03:09:27,730
It doesn't have... Usually... I'm gonna give it...

3824
03:09:27,730 --> 03:09:29,770
I'm gonna give it the front hair.

3825
03:09:29,910 --> 03:09:30,410
A little bit.

3826
03:09:30,730 --> 03:09:32,130
Kinda like a little bit of fringe.

3827
03:09:36,950 --> 03:09:37,470
Cute!

3828
03:09:38,170 --> 03:09:39,090
And a ponytail.

3829
03:09:43,850 --> 03:09:45,130
Maybe not the ponytail.

3830
03:09:45,390 --> 03:09:51,870
Kind of looks like your uncle's rat tail.

3831
03:09:53,930 --> 03:09:56,410
Looks like your uncle's rat tail a little bit.

3832
03:09:59,830 --> 03:10:00,850
There we go.

3833
03:10:01,950 --> 03:10:03,970
There we go, I think.

3834
03:10:06,250 --> 03:10:08,530
Perhaps that is... good.

3835
03:10:10,570 --> 03:10:12,390
Speaking from experience...

3836
03:10:13,450 --> 03:10:16,730
I don't know if my... actually I think one of... I have several uncles.

3837
03:10:17,090 --> 03:10:18,770
I think one of them had a rat tail.

3838
03:10:20,390 --> 03:10:20,790
Yeah.

3839
03:10:21,930 --> 03:10:26,330
Because a couple of my uncles were in a biker gang, so...

3840
03:10:26,910 --> 03:10:28,230
I think one of them had a rat tail.

3841
03:10:28,810 --> 03:10:29,930
When he was in the gang.

3842
03:10:37,710 --> 03:10:39,070
Okay, let me write your name.

3843
03:10:41,310 --> 03:10:42,030
Manthy Rose.

3844
03:10:45,410 --> 03:10:46,510
And your QOC.

3845
03:11:00,190 --> 03:11:01,930
And... I'm sorry, I'm going to delete your OC.

3846
03:11:03,030 --> 03:11:03,470
Goodbye.

3847
03:11:03,770 --> 03:11:04,470
There you go.

3848
03:11:05,870 --> 03:11:06,530
There you go.

3849
03:11:07,150 --> 03:11:08,690
Grandma's side of the family, maybe?

3850
03:11:08,810 --> 03:11:09,010
No!

3851
03:11:09,630 --> 03:11:11,090
The other side of the family.

3852
03:11:11,530 --> 03:11:11,970
Hahaha.

3853
03:11:12,690 --> 03:11:13,130
Hahaha.

3854
03:11:13,130 --> 03:11:14,830
The other side.

3855
03:11:17,310 --> 03:11:17,850
Yeah.

3856
03:11:20,530 --> 03:11:23,910
Your render of the sack of Rome will be my new profile picture.

3857
03:11:24,010 --> 03:11:25,070
Thank you, queen.

3858
03:11:30,290 --> 03:11:31,230
Thank you.

3859
03:11:31,410 --> 03:11:32,510
Thank you for this.

3860
03:11:32,650 --> 03:11:35,970
Thank you for turning this weird detective into a cute little wisp.

3861
03:11:36,070 --> 03:11:37,170
I love this so much.

3862
03:11:37,230 --> 03:11:37,790
Thank you!

3863
03:11:38,880 --> 03:11:40,670
Is your uncle Ghost Rider?

3864
03:11:48,540 --> 03:11:49,380
Yeah, actually.

3865
03:11:53,220 --> 03:11:54,940
Oh yes, the sack of Rome.

3866
03:11:55,040 --> 03:11:56,200
I recall the head pat.

3867
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:02,860
Thank you, Manthy.

3868
03:12:02,920 --> 03:12:03,880
I hope you saved it.

3869
03:12:03,960 --> 03:12:05,240
If not, get it in the VOD.

3870
03:12:09,250 --> 03:12:09,690
Alrighty.

3871
03:12:12,150 --> 03:12:12,590
And...

3872
03:12:13,390 --> 03:12:14,730
Let's do one last one.

3873
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:20,210
Mint is my sack of the Roman Empire.

3874
03:12:20,450 --> 03:12:21,730
What does that mean?

3875
03:12:23,550 --> 03:12:25,670
What is the sack of the Roman Empire?

3876
03:12:26,270 --> 03:12:26,550
Oh!

3877
03:12:26,910 --> 03:12:27,530
Hahaha.

3878
03:12:29,930 --> 03:12:31,690
Our winner is...

3879
03:12:34,170 --> 03:12:34,790
Sideways!

3880
03:12:36,490 --> 03:12:37,110
Hahaha.

3881
03:12:37,330 --> 03:12:37,950
Congrats!

3882
03:12:40,910 --> 03:12:41,530
Congrats!

3883
03:12:41,910 --> 03:12:42,130
Congrats!

3884
03:12:42,450 --> 03:12:43,650
What did you ask for?

3885
03:12:43,790 --> 03:12:44,270
Hahaha.

3886
03:12:48,530 --> 03:12:49,030
Let's go!

3887
03:12:55,110 --> 03:12:55,990
Nothing specifically.

3888
03:12:56,450 --> 03:12:57,710
But have fun with it.

3889
03:12:57,890 --> 03:12:58,650
Love you, Minto!

3890
03:12:59,270 --> 03:13:01,170
While you are here, I saw you...

3891
03:13:01,170 --> 03:13:02,390
Is there anything you actually want?

3892
03:13:04,750 --> 03:13:05,190
Hahaha.

3893
03:13:06,670 --> 03:13:08,610
Do you often think about the Roman Empire, Mint?

3894
03:13:08,710 --> 03:13:10,570
I honestly think about the Romans a lot...

3895
03:13:10,570 --> 03:13:12,730
I think about the Roman Empire...

3896
03:13:17,050 --> 03:13:28,730
I think you can't say you're Roman Empire anymore, because people are always thinking about the Roman Empire now, because they're always talking saying this is my Roman Empire.

3897
03:13:40,750 --> 03:13:45,470
Can I have a red 2002 Mazda Miata with your ribbon on it?

3898
03:13:49,570 --> 03:13:50,930
I got you.

3899
03:13:52,690 --> 03:13:54,070
I got you.

3900
03:13:54,270 --> 03:13:55,450
Not the Miata.

3901
03:13:59,730 --> 03:14:01,350
Not the Miata.

3902
03:14:10,960 --> 03:14:11,600
Okay.

3903
03:14:12,060 --> 03:14:13,400
This is the one, right?

3904
03:14:13,720 --> 03:14:21,720
To whoever's car this is, thank you for allowing me to use it for my commercial use.

3905
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:27,240
Actually, I'm gonna make it a little bit smaller so that you can screenshot it more easily.

3906
03:14:27,680 --> 03:14:29,440
Okay, so first...

3907
03:14:37,390 --> 03:14:38,350
There we go.

3908
03:14:38,470 --> 03:14:38,870
Alright.

3909
03:14:39,190 --> 03:14:40,150
We're gonna...

3910
03:14:41,350 --> 03:14:42,410
We're gonna do this.

3911
03:14:46,890 --> 03:14:48,670
We're gonna put me on the car.

3912
03:14:54,030 --> 03:14:55,870
We're gonna wrap me on...

3913
03:14:55,870 --> 03:14:58,330
Actually, maybe I should be the other way.

3914
03:14:59,590 --> 03:15:00,510
Gonna put...

3915
03:15:00,510 --> 03:15:01,770
Yeah, Itasha time, baby.

3916
03:15:03,590 --> 03:15:05,210
We're gonna put me on the car.

3917
03:15:05,850 --> 03:15:06,910
Yeah, it's gonna be...

3918
03:15:06,910 --> 03:15:07,710
Actually...

3919
03:15:07,710 --> 03:15:09,170
No, it doesn't have to be sideways.

3920
03:15:09,490 --> 03:15:10,810
It can just be...

3921
03:15:12,610 --> 03:15:13,810
Multiple of me.

3922
03:15:17,330 --> 03:15:19,530
It can be many of me.

3923
03:15:25,330 --> 03:15:25,850
Multiple...

3924
03:15:25,850 --> 03:15:27,070
Multiple Minto.

3925
03:15:27,710 --> 03:15:28,630
Okay, hold on.

3926
03:15:28,670 --> 03:15:30,590
I do have to do this though.

3927
03:15:36,050 --> 03:15:37,410
Gotta pimp that rod.

3928
03:15:37,650 --> 03:15:38,010
Yeah.

3929
03:15:39,310 --> 03:15:41,810
Actually, for this one, we'll have one here.

3930
03:15:42,470 --> 03:15:45,090
Hold on, I'm gonna make it transparent first.

3931
03:15:45,890 --> 03:15:48,110
And then we'll have this one here.

3932
03:15:48,570 --> 03:15:49,750
But flipped.

3933
03:15:54,530 --> 03:15:55,550
That scared me.

3934
03:15:56,450 --> 03:15:57,410
But flipped.

3935
03:15:57,690 --> 03:15:58,170
Oh.

3936
03:15:58,170 --> 03:15:58,250
Oh.

3937
03:16:00,010 --> 03:16:00,750
There we go.

3938
03:16:02,790 --> 03:16:03,230
Nice.

3939
03:16:03,450 --> 03:16:03,810
Okay.

3940
03:16:05,410 --> 03:16:07,830
So, 4 Minto on a car.

3941
03:16:09,310 --> 03:16:10,890
4 Minto on a car.

3942
03:16:11,590 --> 03:16:12,410
Just like this.

3943
03:16:12,750 --> 03:16:14,090
Okay, now we erase.

3944
03:16:15,890 --> 03:16:17,170
Which is the first Minto?

3945
03:16:18,230 --> 03:16:19,790
Wait, which is the original?

3946
03:16:19,990 --> 03:16:20,270
Okay.

3947
03:16:20,590 --> 03:16:22,370
You're not the original, but we'll take it.

3948
03:16:22,470 --> 03:16:22,650
Okay.

3949
03:16:24,150 --> 03:16:25,350
So, the reason we're...

3950
03:16:30,610 --> 03:16:31,530
Minto sisters?

3951
03:16:32,150 --> 03:16:33,310
Are they single?

3952
03:16:33,390 --> 03:16:35,410
Asking for a... Frened.

3953
03:16:37,690 --> 03:16:42,830
I think Frened should have enough courage to ask for themselves.

3954
03:16:44,510 --> 03:16:45,430
Just saying.

3955
03:16:46,670 --> 03:16:48,930
I'm actually considering doing them, by the way.

3956
03:16:49,150 --> 03:16:52,630
Kinda sorta abandoned my old project that a Miata is smaller and cheaper.

3957
03:16:55,490 --> 03:16:57,930
Don't worry, I haven't forgotten the headband.

3958
03:16:58,230 --> 03:16:59,730
But why red on it?

3959
03:16:59,890 --> 03:17:01,230
I'm not red at all.

3960
03:17:03,030 --> 03:17:04,350
I'm not red at all.

3961
03:17:11,770 --> 03:17:12,890
I wouldn't match.

3962
03:17:13,910 --> 03:17:15,770
Red for the rage inside you.

3963
03:17:21,290 --> 03:17:22,510
Actually, hold on.

3964
03:17:22,950 --> 03:17:25,050
I'm gonna take a picture just for this.

3965
03:17:33,230 --> 03:17:35,630
Just for this Itasha.

3966
03:17:39,250 --> 03:17:39,890
Okay.

3967
03:17:39,890 --> 03:17:41,070
Save image.

3968
03:17:43,590 --> 03:17:44,230
Okay.

3969
03:17:45,790 --> 03:17:47,250
Now the red will match.

3970
03:17:51,690 --> 03:17:54,230
Now the red will match.

3971
03:17:55,150 --> 03:17:57,190
Sorry if it's not flushed, by the way.

3972
03:17:57,330 --> 03:17:59,450
I'm doing my best.

3973
03:18:02,550 --> 03:18:03,910
I'm doing my best.

3974
03:18:03,910 --> 03:18:05,810
My minto besto.

3975
03:18:07,450 --> 03:18:08,270
Ganba minto.

3976
03:18:09,390 --> 03:18:10,430
Oh, not that one.

3977
03:18:13,290 --> 03:18:14,170
Is it this one?

3978
03:18:16,570 --> 03:18:17,010
Yup.

3979
03:18:23,350 --> 03:18:24,550
Wait, I messed up.

3980
03:18:24,670 --> 03:18:25,330
Okay, hold on.

3981
03:18:25,510 --> 03:18:27,410
These need to be more... hmm.

3982
03:18:27,590 --> 03:18:28,450
How do I do this?

3983
03:18:30,350 --> 03:18:32,550
Right now, they're kind of conjoined twins.

3984
03:18:33,190 --> 03:18:33,750
That's okay.

3985
03:18:35,590 --> 03:18:37,890
One can be higher and one can be...

3986
03:18:37,890 --> 03:18:38,290
Oh, like that.

3987
03:18:38,370 --> 03:18:38,650
Like that.

3988
03:18:38,710 --> 03:18:39,010
Like that.

3989
03:18:39,310 --> 03:18:41,370
One can be higher and one can be lower.

3990
03:18:42,910 --> 03:18:43,770
Just like that.

3991
03:18:50,190 --> 03:18:50,690
Oh, wait.

3992
03:18:50,710 --> 03:18:51,190
Wrong one.

3993
03:18:51,370 --> 03:18:51,890
This one.

3994
03:18:52,030 --> 03:18:52,670
There we go.

3995
03:19:00,870 --> 03:19:02,330
If anybody... I mean...

3996
03:19:02,330 --> 03:19:05,550
I don't expect anybody to ever make an Itasha out of me.

3997
03:19:05,630 --> 03:19:07,430
But it would be very cool to see.

3998
03:19:08,010 --> 03:19:08,810
I love...

3999
03:19:08,810 --> 03:19:09,650
Um...

4000
03:19:10,790 --> 03:19:12,090
Seeing Itasha.

4001
03:19:15,690 --> 03:19:16,450
So...

4002
03:19:17,470 --> 03:19:18,370
You know.

4003
03:19:18,430 --> 03:19:20,450
Not that I'm expecting it or anything.

4004
03:19:20,850 --> 03:19:21,710
I'm just saying.

4005
03:19:21,950 --> 03:19:25,450
If you decide to... If you're like, I want to make an Itasha or someone.

4006
03:19:25,890 --> 03:19:26,650
Uh...

4007
03:19:26,650 --> 03:19:27,770
A certain...

4008
03:19:27,770 --> 03:19:32,630
A certain ghost maid would be super enthused about the idea.

4009
03:19:34,510 --> 03:19:35,910
I'm just saying.

4010
03:19:37,550 --> 03:19:38,790
I'm just saying.

4011
03:19:38,790 --> 03:19:40,670
Someone of my...

4012
03:19:41,670 --> 03:19:42,350
Of me.

4013
03:19:43,130 --> 03:19:43,570
My...

4014
03:19:43,570 --> 03:19:44,430
Um...

4015
03:19:47,630 --> 03:19:49,930
My personality would be very excited.

4016
03:19:53,030 --> 03:19:54,990
It's just the hood for this one, by the way.

4017
03:19:55,050 --> 03:19:55,810
It's just the hood.

4018
03:19:56,430 --> 03:19:57,230
I see.

4019
03:19:57,290 --> 03:19:57,690
I see.

4020
03:20:00,070 --> 03:20:00,950
I see.

4021
03:20:00,990 --> 03:20:01,350
I see.

4022
03:20:08,830 --> 03:20:09,270
Uh...

4023
03:20:09,270 --> 03:20:10,110
Uh...

4024
03:20:10,110 --> 03:20:10,310
Uh...

4025
03:20:10,310 --> 03:20:10,710
Uh...

4026
03:20:19,550 --> 03:20:21,430
Why can't I get this?

4027
03:20:21,510 --> 03:20:22,670
Why is it going so...

4028
03:20:22,670 --> 03:20:24,250
Why is it like so janky?

4029
03:20:26,930 --> 03:20:28,470
Why is it so lumpy?

4030
03:20:29,030 --> 03:20:29,810
What's going on?

4031
03:20:32,510 --> 03:20:33,250
What's happening?

4032
03:20:33,430 --> 03:20:33,850
Stop!

4033
03:20:34,110 --> 03:20:34,490
Stop!

4034
03:20:38,310 --> 03:20:38,790
Okay.

4035
03:20:39,070 --> 03:20:41,570
Oh my gosh.

4036
03:20:41,870 --> 03:20:42,790
Eraser too big?

4037
03:20:43,250 --> 03:20:44,830
I don't think it's the eraser's fault.

4038
03:20:44,970 --> 03:20:45,430
It's like...

4039
03:20:45,430 --> 03:20:46,250
It's like...

4040
03:20:46,250 --> 03:20:47,990
When I do it, it's...

4041
03:20:48,430 --> 03:20:49,870
First of all, it's like...

4042
03:20:49,870 --> 03:20:50,530
Look at that.

4043
03:20:50,730 --> 03:20:52,110
Look at the size of the eraser.

4044
03:20:52,410 --> 03:20:53,450
But that's all it does.

4045
03:20:53,630 --> 03:20:54,690
It's that tiny amount.

4046
03:20:56,670 --> 03:20:58,390
And then, I think it's like...

4047
03:20:58,390 --> 03:20:58,810
Not...

4048
03:20:58,810 --> 03:21:00,710
It's like making it not very smooth.

4049
03:21:00,930 --> 03:21:02,030
Oh, smoothing is off.

4050
03:21:02,090 --> 03:21:02,510
That's why.

4051
03:21:06,130 --> 03:21:08,610
Maybe I just needed smoothing on a little bit more.

4052
03:21:08,710 --> 03:21:11,190
But it's hard to tell where...

4053
03:21:11,190 --> 03:21:11,210
Hmm.

4054
03:21:11,510 --> 03:21:11,950
Wee!

4055
03:21:12,730 --> 03:21:13,170
Wee!

4056
03:21:14,150 --> 03:21:14,990
Help me!

4057
03:21:15,030 --> 03:21:15,350
Help me!

4058
03:21:15,430 --> 03:21:15,530
Please!

4059
03:21:17,730 --> 03:21:18,630
I'm doing my best.

4060
03:21:18,810 --> 03:21:19,530
No one will notice.

4061
03:21:19,650 --> 03:21:20,950
Your profile picture will be too small.

4062
03:21:22,310 --> 03:21:22,630
Okay.

4063
03:21:22,670 --> 03:21:22,970
That's one.

4064
03:21:25,310 --> 03:21:25,630
Sorry.

4065
03:21:28,610 --> 03:21:29,950
I'm like so focused on this.

4066
03:21:29,990 --> 03:21:30,890
I'm barely reading chat.

4067
03:21:41,840 --> 03:21:42,280
Oh, wait.

4068
03:21:42,340 --> 03:21:43,540
Now, the smoothing is at a hundred.

4069
03:21:43,760 --> 03:21:44,120
No, no.

4070
03:21:44,160 --> 03:21:44,740
I turned it off.

4071
03:21:44,800 --> 03:21:46,240
So, I can do this quickly.

4072
03:21:47,100 --> 03:21:47,420
Okay.

4073
03:21:48,120 --> 03:21:48,660
There we go.

4074
03:21:50,800 --> 03:21:51,120
Okay.

4075
03:21:52,980 --> 03:21:53,300
Next.

4076
03:21:53,300 --> 03:21:53,400
Okay.

4077
03:21:53,420 --> 03:21:55,080
Next is this one.

4078
03:21:57,240 --> 03:21:58,580
Is it this one?

4079
03:22:00,600 --> 03:22:01,200
No.

4080
03:22:01,500 --> 03:22:02,340
This one.

4081
03:22:03,260 --> 03:22:03,860
Okay.

4082
03:22:04,260 --> 03:22:05,920
Let's get rid of the body.

4083
03:22:06,120 --> 03:22:07,480
Yadda yadda yadda.

4084
03:22:08,780 --> 03:22:10,640
Get rid of the bodies.

4085
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:12,340
Hide the bodies.

4086
03:22:12,800 --> 03:22:14,380
Dispose of the bodies.

4087
03:22:16,140 --> 03:22:18,420
Oh, what happened to my body?

4088
03:22:19,300 --> 03:22:20,720
I don't know actually.

4089
03:22:21,240 --> 03:22:22,220
Kind of freaky.

4090
03:22:22,400 --> 03:22:23,400
I wonder who's next.

4091
03:22:23,400 --> 03:22:26,960
Congrats on 200k!

4092
03:22:27,100 --> 03:22:28,040
Thank you!

4093
03:22:28,240 --> 03:22:29,700
Thank you so much!

4094
03:22:31,500 --> 03:22:33,560
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

4095
03:22:37,950 --> 03:22:40,270
Dispose of the bodies!

4096
03:22:41,730 --> 03:22:44,270
Hide the bodies!

4097
03:22:45,650 --> 03:22:49,610
Get rid of the bodies!

4098
03:22:50,070 --> 03:22:52,950
We won't be caught today!

4099
03:22:54,570 --> 03:22:57,030
I'm not doing time!

4100
03:22:57,870 --> 03:23:00,770
Not for this crime!

4101
03:23:01,970 --> 03:23:04,930
We'll hide the bodies away!

4102
03:23:05,910 --> 03:23:09,710
And see the sun the next day!

4103
03:23:10,870 --> 03:23:12,790
And see the sun the next day!

4104
03:23:13,350 --> 03:23:14,350
Okay.

4105
03:23:14,590 --> 03:23:16,010
That one wasn't so bad.

4106
03:23:16,250 --> 03:23:17,170
Oh my god!

4107
03:23:17,450 --> 03:23:17,610
Wait.

4108
03:23:20,850 --> 03:23:21,350
Whatever.

4109
03:23:25,030 --> 03:23:26,390
Are you guys seeing the vision?

4110
03:23:26,890 --> 03:23:28,510
First of all though, I have to...

4111
03:23:28,510 --> 03:23:30,890
I have to erase my forehead here.

4112
03:23:38,810 --> 03:23:39,790
Goodbye forehead.

4113
03:23:41,210 --> 03:23:44,450
Alright, last but not least.

4114
03:23:46,530 --> 03:23:47,230
This one.

4115
03:23:49,170 --> 03:23:50,950
I can totally see the vision.

4116
03:23:51,250 --> 03:23:51,950
You can?

4117
03:23:56,630 --> 03:23:57,570
I'm a split head now.

4118
03:23:58,490 --> 03:23:59,550
Hole in the head.

4119
03:23:59,630 --> 03:24:00,250
Head empty.

4120
03:24:01,190 --> 03:24:02,890
If you look inside...

4121
03:24:02,890 --> 03:24:04,730
If you peer inside my mind...

4122
03:24:05,310 --> 03:24:06,290
You will see.

4123
03:24:08,030 --> 03:24:09,190
Gas, gas, gas.

4124
03:24:11,910 --> 03:24:13,510
Gas, gas, gas.

4125
03:24:14,170 --> 03:24:14,690
Gas, gas, gas.

4126
03:24:14,690 --> 03:24:16,410
That's all that's going on in there.

4127
03:24:24,630 --> 03:24:25,610
That's all that's going on in there.

4128
03:24:25,610 --> 03:24:26,030
Alright.

4129
03:24:26,470 --> 03:24:28,190
It might be a little bit messy.

4130
03:24:28,190 --> 03:24:28,910
But uh...

4131
03:24:31,210 --> 03:24:33,090
I just don't have steady hands.

4132
03:24:33,270 --> 03:24:33,530
Okay.

4133
03:24:34,570 --> 03:24:35,310
Good enough.

4134
03:24:36,390 --> 03:24:37,190
Good enough.

4135
03:24:39,790 --> 03:24:40,550
Oh no!

4136
03:24:40,630 --> 03:24:42,150
I forgot the body on the other one!

4137
03:24:42,370 --> 03:24:43,870
We didn't finish hiding the body!

4138
03:24:44,630 --> 03:24:46,170
We're terrible criminals.

4139
03:24:46,530 --> 03:24:47,670
We're so bad at this.

4140
03:24:48,170 --> 03:24:49,390
Frank, welcome to membership.

4141
03:24:49,850 --> 03:24:50,930
Thank you very much.

4142
03:24:51,470 --> 03:24:52,250
Thank you.

4143
03:24:52,630 --> 03:24:53,930
I appreciate it.

4144
03:25:03,600 --> 03:25:04,380
Very good.

4145
03:25:06,280 --> 03:25:07,660
Sideways, what do you think so far?

4146
03:25:08,380 --> 03:25:11,280
Rate my Itasha skills out of 10?

4147
03:25:11,480 --> 03:25:12,040
Rate my Itasha skills out of 10?

4148
03:25:12,040 --> 03:25:12,980
Rate my Itasha skills out of 10?

4149
03:25:16,110 --> 03:25:18,030
Oh, but did you think I was done?

4150
03:25:18,750 --> 03:25:19,310
Because...

4151
03:25:19,310 --> 03:25:21,650
What would this car be without?

4152
03:25:22,390 --> 03:25:22,410
What would this car be without?

4153
03:25:25,010 --> 03:25:26,250
One more Minto!

4154
03:25:26,490 --> 03:25:26,950
One more Minto!

4155
03:25:27,490 --> 03:25:28,630
But this time...

4156
03:25:29,490 --> 03:25:29,770
Vito!

4157
03:25:34,330 --> 03:25:35,310
More.

4158
03:25:35,890 --> 03:25:37,110
One more.

4159
03:25:38,770 --> 03:25:40,390
Oh, I have to also...

4160
03:25:40,390 --> 03:25:45,990
One more Minto.

4161
03:25:46,310 --> 03:25:47,830
One more Minto.

4162
03:25:57,330 --> 03:25:57,820
Enhance.

4163
03:26:03,690 --> 03:26:04,670
Enhance.

4164
03:26:04,750 --> 03:26:05,310
Okay.

4165
03:26:05,630 --> 03:26:07,670
Very good.

4166
03:26:07,870 --> 03:26:10,150
She knows what the people want!

4167
03:26:13,590 --> 03:26:16,670
I don't know if Sideways is a feet guy.

4168
03:26:17,750 --> 03:26:18,410
Feet person.

4169
03:26:19,490 --> 03:26:20,530
I have no idea.

4170
03:26:23,110 --> 03:26:26,630
But I think because you can't see my legs at all in the car.

4171
03:26:27,070 --> 03:26:28,730
It's kind of important to have it there.

4172
03:26:28,830 --> 03:26:29,050
You know?

4173
03:26:30,090 --> 03:26:30,990
I think it's...

4174
03:26:30,990 --> 03:26:32,250
I think it would be better.

4175
03:26:34,930 --> 03:26:36,210
This actually looks pretty good.

4176
03:26:37,390 --> 03:26:38,050
I'd say.

4177
03:26:40,450 --> 03:26:40,990
I think it's...

4178
03:26:41,450 --> 03:26:42,830
Alright, what did I put that one at?

4179
03:26:43,050 --> 03:26:43,410
84.

4180
03:26:46,850 --> 03:26:47,210
Okay.

4181
03:26:48,910 --> 03:26:49,490
Oh no!

4182
03:26:49,570 --> 03:26:50,470
I took that one picture!

4183
03:26:50,790 --> 03:26:51,930
I gotta add it somewhere.

4184
03:26:54,610 --> 03:26:55,750
I gotta add it somewhere.

4185
03:26:55,850 --> 03:26:56,190
Hold on.

4186
03:26:57,750 --> 03:26:58,110
84...

4187
03:26:58,110 --> 03:26:59,410
Where should I put it?

4188
03:27:11,430 --> 03:27:13,290
Oh, I'll put it... I could put it here.

4189
03:27:13,410 --> 03:27:13,870
I could put it here.

4190
03:27:14,190 --> 03:27:14,750
I think.

4191
03:27:15,910 --> 03:27:15,990
Wait!

4192
03:27:16,070 --> 03:27:17,310
I have an even better idea.

4193
03:27:17,690 --> 03:27:18,650
I have a better idea.

4194
03:27:18,770 --> 03:27:19,250
I have a better idea.

4195
03:27:28,950 --> 03:27:29,310
Okay.

4196
03:27:29,490 --> 03:27:29,750
Okay.

4197
03:27:29,830 --> 03:27:30,050
Okay.

4198
03:27:38,750 --> 03:27:40,350
It's a window.

4199
03:27:40,570 --> 03:27:41,310
It's a windshield.

4200
03:27:42,950 --> 03:27:43,610
Windshield cover.

4201
03:27:44,850 --> 03:27:46,030
It's a windshield cover.

4202
03:27:47,010 --> 03:27:48,410
Gotta make it a little bit bigger though.

4203
03:27:51,650 --> 03:27:52,350
Not good enough.

4204
03:28:01,060 --> 03:28:02,100
Let's get rid of this.

4205
03:28:08,960 --> 03:28:12,180
All these pesky body parts that we don't need.

4206
03:28:12,840 --> 03:28:13,760
All these pesky body parts that we don't need.

4207
03:28:13,760 --> 03:28:14,380
Get out of here.

4208
03:28:14,400 --> 03:28:15,740
Oh, and then of course the headband.

4209
03:28:15,900 --> 03:28:16,720
Don't worry, I haven't forgotten.

4210
03:28:17,160 --> 03:28:18,680
I'll probably forget later.

4211
03:28:19,600 --> 03:28:20,820
I'll probably forget later.

4212
03:28:21,160 --> 03:28:22,820
Please remind me if I forget.

4213
03:28:23,120 --> 03:28:23,740
Actually, no.

4214
03:28:24,020 --> 03:28:24,900
I'll do it right now.

4215
03:28:26,460 --> 03:28:28,180
I just don't remember where I have it saved.

4216
03:28:29,800 --> 03:28:30,200
...

4217
03:28:33,120 --> 03:28:35,040
Now I remember where I saved it.

4218
03:28:36,240 --> 03:28:39,200
Now I remember where I saved it.

4219
03:28:47,460 --> 03:28:48,920
I don't know where it is.

4220
03:28:50,080 --> 03:28:50,840
Oh, I have it!

4221
03:29:00,820 --> 03:29:03,660
But uh, let's hide it for now so I can take care of this part.

4222
03:29:04,280 --> 03:29:04,680
...

4223
03:29:07,420 --> 03:29:07,940
Sorry.

4224
03:29:09,920 --> 03:29:10,580
Scared me.

4225
03:29:32,620 --> 03:29:34,360
Can't tell where the windshield begins.

4226
03:29:38,690 --> 03:29:40,490
I think this is correct.

4227
03:29:43,930 --> 03:29:45,250
It's gonna be a little cut off.

4228
03:29:45,290 --> 03:29:47,230
You won't see my dashing smile.

4229
03:29:47,450 --> 03:29:47,970
But that's okay.

4230
03:29:49,790 --> 03:29:50,410
That's okay.

4231
03:29:50,470 --> 03:29:51,090
That's fine.

4232
03:30:00,150 --> 03:30:00,590
Okay.

4233
03:30:00,590 --> 03:30:01,350
It's all good.

4234
03:30:01,830 --> 03:30:02,650
It's all good.

4235
03:30:03,230 --> 03:30:04,090
It's all good.

4236
03:30:04,570 --> 03:30:05,370
It's all fine.

4237
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:12,400
Does the car gain any mint ghost powers?

4238
03:30:19,120 --> 03:30:21,980
It actually sounds like that when you drive it.

4239
03:30:24,940 --> 03:30:27,460
Do you know how there are some cars that...

4240
03:30:27,460 --> 03:30:30,700
make so much noise, they're like...

4241
03:30:31,620 --> 03:30:33,880
This one, everyone will know...

4242
03:30:33,880 --> 03:30:36,260
while they're driving the mint Miata...

4243
03:30:47,840 --> 03:30:52,020
You can hear it everywhere... the mint miata.

4244
03:30:53,060 --> 03:30:54,160
No one is safe.

4245
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:04,260
I can't tell if this is part of the windshield or not.

4246
03:31:06,240 --> 03:31:07,620
So I'm just gonna do it like that.

4247
03:31:16,170 --> 03:31:17,250
And then the headband.

4248
03:31:21,390 --> 03:31:24,290
The radio plays exclusively Bustin'.

4249
03:31:25,310 --> 03:31:27,610
When you honk the horn it goes...

4250
03:31:27,610 --> 03:31:28,510
B-B-B-Bustin'!

4251
03:31:28,510 --> 03:31:29,610
B-B-B-Bustin'!

4252
03:31:29,610 --> 03:31:31,390
B-B-B-B-B-Bustin'!

4253
03:31:33,370 --> 03:31:33,830
Yeah!

4254
03:31:35,510 --> 03:31:37,310
How we feelin' ladies?

4255
03:31:37,470 --> 03:31:38,790
How we feelin'?

4256
03:31:38,790 --> 03:31:39,690
Alright, hold on.

4257
03:31:39,730 --> 03:31:40,410
One more thing.

4258
03:31:40,830 --> 03:31:42,790
I'm gonna draw you two sideways.

4259
03:31:56,920 --> 03:31:58,160
There you are!

4260
03:32:00,660 --> 03:32:01,720
And um...

4261
03:32:01,720 --> 03:32:03,440
Where should I write your name?

4262
03:32:13,510 --> 03:32:14,310
2013...

4263
03:32:19,690 --> 03:32:20,490
Yeah!

4264
03:32:21,530 --> 03:32:23,010
Not even sideways?

4265
03:32:25,610 --> 03:32:26,690
You're right.

4266
03:32:28,290 --> 03:32:29,510
Ugh, you're right.

4267
03:32:31,690 --> 03:32:32,190
It's okay.

4268
03:32:33,170 --> 03:32:35,450
I don't want him to look like he's dead on the ground, you know?

4269
03:32:36,090 --> 03:32:37,290
Rotate it by 90 degrees.

4270
03:32:38,510 --> 03:32:40,870
But then the name... I'll have to redo the name too.

4271
03:33:11,750 --> 03:33:15,090
And let me zoom in so you can screenshot.

4272
03:33:15,090 --> 03:33:15,190
Screenshot?

4273
03:33:17,830 --> 03:33:19,030
Oh, uh...

4274
03:33:19,030 --> 03:33:19,290
Uh...

4275
03:33:20,170 --> 03:33:20,770
Uh...

4276
03:33:21,930 --> 03:33:23,330
Once again, there we go.

4277
03:33:25,830 --> 03:33:27,010
I'll move out of the way.

4278
03:33:27,230 --> 03:33:28,250
Get your screenshot!

4279
03:33:29,250 --> 03:33:30,570
Oh, there we go.

4280
03:33:30,690 --> 03:33:31,590
Get your screenshot!

4281
03:33:32,010 --> 03:33:33,170
Get your screenshot!

4282
03:33:34,830 --> 03:33:35,790
The mint miata.

4283
03:33:38,990 --> 03:33:39,590
Mintata?

4284
03:33:40,090 --> 03:33:40,650
No!

4285
03:33:42,550 --> 03:33:44,070
That sounds icky.

4286
03:33:46,490 --> 03:33:47,150
Okay.

4287
03:33:47,350 --> 03:33:48,310
Thank you, Minto.

4288
03:33:48,550 --> 03:33:49,390
You're welcome!

4289
03:33:52,750 --> 03:33:55,630
You are so welcome.

4290
03:33:58,930 --> 03:34:00,750
It almost looks legit.

4291
03:34:01,030 --> 03:34:03,230
It almost looks convincing, I'd say.

4292
03:34:03,510 --> 03:34:04,350
Oh, wait.

4293
03:34:04,430 --> 03:34:07,250
I just realized this part is bad.

4294
03:34:11,300 --> 03:34:11,960
Wait.

4295
03:34:15,040 --> 03:34:16,980
That part was sticking up too much.

4296
03:34:22,420 --> 03:34:23,100
There we go.

4297
03:34:23,280 --> 03:34:24,180
I fixed it.

4298
03:34:24,260 --> 03:34:24,720
I fixed it.

4299
03:34:25,060 --> 03:34:26,100
Take another screen.

4300
03:34:26,340 --> 03:34:26,760
Oh, wait.

4301
03:34:27,020 --> 03:34:28,180
I gotta move over.

4302
03:34:28,300 --> 03:34:28,580
Oh, wait.

4303
03:34:28,620 --> 03:34:30,220
I'm gonna zoom out all the time.

4304
03:34:33,440 --> 03:34:33,840
There.

4305
03:34:33,900 --> 03:34:34,400
There we go.

4306
03:34:34,540 --> 03:34:34,940
There we go.

4307
03:34:35,240 --> 03:34:35,880
There we go.

4308
03:34:35,880 --> 03:34:36,260
There we go.

4309
03:34:37,040 --> 03:34:38,060
It's gotta be authentic.

4310
03:34:38,780 --> 03:34:39,820
It's gotta be authentic.

4311
03:34:40,340 --> 03:34:43,300
It's gotta be, like, really convincing.

4312
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:46,560
What am I looking at?

4313
03:34:46,880 --> 03:34:47,920
I just got here.

4314
03:34:48,020 --> 03:34:51,500
You're looking at the new, the fancy, this...

4315
03:34:51,500 --> 03:34:53,040
Forget the cyber truck.

4316
03:34:53,400 --> 03:34:55,480
It's time for the ghost truck.

4317
03:34:55,740 --> 03:34:57,540
The bull brigade.

4318
03:34:57,900 --> 03:35:00,700
The, the, the, the ghost...

4319
03:35:00,700 --> 03:35:00,900
Wait.

4320
03:35:02,500 --> 03:35:03,420
The mint mobile.

4321
03:35:05,500 --> 03:35:06,280
Oh, my gosh.

4322
03:35:06,320 --> 03:35:07,300
Thank you for the Akasupa!

4323
03:35:08,020 --> 03:35:10,360
Can't believe my Oshii is taking my first Akasupa.

4324
03:35:10,400 --> 03:35:11,500
I mean, what were you thinking?

4325
03:35:13,180 --> 03:35:14,480
Thank you for the Akasupa!

4326
03:35:14,880 --> 03:35:15,600
Thank you!

4327
03:35:17,870 --> 03:35:19,270
The mint Miata!

4328
03:35:19,570 --> 03:35:19,950
Oh, my gosh.

4329
03:35:20,030 --> 03:35:20,370
Oshii!

4330
03:35:20,690 --> 03:35:22,090
Thank you for the big Akasupa.

4331
03:35:22,310 --> 03:35:23,350
Congrats on 200,000!

4332
03:35:23,830 --> 03:35:24,630
Thank you!

4333
03:35:24,850 --> 03:35:25,450
Thank you!

4334
03:35:25,590 --> 03:35:25,730
Thank you!

4335
03:35:25,750 --> 03:35:26,150
Thank you!

4336
03:35:27,670 --> 03:35:29,430
The mint mobile...

4337
03:35:32,550 --> 03:35:33,570
There's a bit on the wheel.

4338
03:35:36,310 --> 03:35:36,710
This...

4339
03:35:36,710 --> 03:35:37,730
This down here?

4340
03:35:38,830 --> 03:35:39,670
Oh, I see it.

4341
03:35:39,710 --> 03:35:40,050
I see it.

4342
03:35:40,110 --> 03:35:40,450
I see it.

4343
03:35:40,490 --> 03:35:40,870
I see it.

4344
03:35:44,110 --> 03:35:44,590
Oh!

4345
03:35:45,330 --> 03:35:46,670
This on the wheel!

4346
03:35:46,850 --> 03:35:49,370
Oh my gosh, you're so... I'm so sorry!

4347
03:35:49,530 --> 03:35:50,970
Oh my gosh, it's so embarrassing.

4348
03:35:52,750 --> 03:35:54,850
Oh my gosh, I missed so much!

4349
03:35:57,090 --> 03:35:59,210
Oh my gosh, there's even more!

4350
03:36:02,370 --> 03:36:03,350
That's so embarrassing.

4351
03:36:03,770 --> 03:36:05,230
Oh my gosh, sideways please.

4352
03:36:05,350 --> 03:36:06,930
I don't deserve that, Akasupa.

4353
03:36:07,810 --> 03:36:08,750
I messed up.

4354
03:36:08,810 --> 03:36:09,570
I messed up bad.

4355
03:36:09,870 --> 03:36:12,790
I was looking at this part right here, this tiny bitty bit.

4356
03:36:13,730 --> 03:36:16,030
I was like, oh you're right, it does kind of stick out.

4357
03:36:18,350 --> 03:36:19,270
So I'll fix it.

4358
03:36:23,410 --> 03:36:28,490
Okay, now... it should be... third time's the charm.

4359
03:36:29,270 --> 03:36:30,790
Wait, third time's the charm.

4360
03:36:39,310 --> 03:36:40,110
There you go.

4361
03:36:40,350 --> 03:36:41,990
There you go.

4362
03:36:42,650 --> 03:36:43,730
Okay, thank you.

4363
03:36:44,030 --> 03:36:45,710
Oh my gosh, I can't believe I missed that.

4364
03:36:45,730 --> 03:36:46,410
That's so embarrassing.

4365
03:36:47,590 --> 03:36:49,190
I'm gonna think about that for the rest of my afterlife.

4366
03:36:51,890 --> 03:36:53,930
I'm gonna think about that for the rest of my afterlife.

4367
03:36:59,110 --> 03:37:00,870
Tiny bit near the front headlight?

4368
03:37:02,310 --> 03:37:03,710
Wait, do you mean this part?

4369
03:37:04,130 --> 03:37:05,750
Is that not just a shine on the car?

4370
03:37:13,870 --> 03:37:15,070
Fourth time's the charm.

4371
03:37:15,270 --> 03:37:15,910
Lucky number.

4372
03:37:16,770 --> 03:37:17,770
Spooky number four!

4373
03:37:18,690 --> 03:37:19,790
Spooky number four!

4374
03:37:27,390 --> 03:37:28,390
There we go.

4375
03:37:29,030 --> 03:37:29,890
Ka-chow!

4376
03:37:35,420 --> 03:37:42,660
There's a bit of... a bit of... a bit of... a bit of mint in the bottom left corner.

4377
03:37:42,760 --> 03:37:43,580
You know what, it's dead.

4378
03:37:43,880 --> 03:37:44,980
The bit is dead.

4379
03:37:45,360 --> 03:37:49,620
The bint of bint is... the bint of... the bit of mint is... the bint is dead.

4380
03:37:50,980 --> 03:37:52,860
Where do you get your mints at?

4381
03:37:54,980 --> 03:37:56,400
Where do you get your mints printed?

4382
03:37:57,020 --> 03:37:57,820
Bogo's minted?

4383
03:38:00,860 --> 03:38:03,220
Well guys, I think that was a good one to end on.

4384
03:38:04,280 --> 03:38:07,060
Like I said, this won't be the last time I do this.

4385
03:38:10,460 --> 03:38:13,780
Let me show you what my schedule is for next week.

4386
03:38:14,780 --> 03:38:15,220
Though...

4387
03:38:15,700 --> 03:38:16,320
Oh, whoops.

4388
03:38:16,960 --> 03:38:18,320
Though, I think...

4389
03:38:20,060 --> 03:38:23,280
I think it will probably change because...

4390
03:38:23,280 --> 03:38:24,400
Oops, not that.

4391
03:38:25,120 --> 03:38:27,880
Because maybe I have to do something for 200k.

4392
03:38:27,920 --> 03:38:32,500
So take this with like a grain of salt at the moment.

4393
03:38:33,180 --> 03:38:35,780
It's not totally complete.

4394
03:38:35,860 --> 03:38:37,240
It's maybe not accurate.

4395
03:38:42,980 --> 03:38:45,820
I'll probably change...

4396
03:38:46,780 --> 03:38:48,020
Wait, let us know.

4397
03:38:48,060 --> 03:38:50,480
Nazo can be my thing for 200k.

4398
03:38:53,540 --> 03:38:55,000
200k Atlantis, no Nazo!

4399
03:38:57,620 --> 03:38:59,040
Or is it Nazo no Atlantis?

4400
03:38:59,120 --> 03:38:59,240
Wait.

4401
03:38:59,760 --> 03:39:01,160
No, it's Atlantis no Nazo, right?

4402
03:39:01,980 --> 03:39:03,380
Am I losing it right now?

4403
03:39:03,420 --> 03:39:04,780
I think I'm very tired because I'm hungry.

4404
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:07,360
Yeah, so...

4405
03:39:10,560 --> 03:39:13,380
Yeah, I have a collab with Lia.

4406
03:39:13,620 --> 03:39:16,500
Actually, she asked me to send her some stuff for it.

4407
03:39:16,580 --> 03:39:18,280
And I had to stream, so...

4408
03:39:21,040 --> 03:39:25,500
Yeah, collabing with Lia on her channel.

4409
03:39:25,940 --> 03:39:29,660
So technically, I won't be streaming on my channel that day.

4410
03:39:31,980 --> 03:39:34,200
And Monday, tomorrow...

4411
03:39:34,200 --> 03:39:35,940
The podcast.

4412
03:39:38,960 --> 03:39:39,740
And...

4413
03:39:42,050 --> 03:39:42,440
And...

4414
03:39:45,100 --> 03:39:47,360
Sunday, I'm seeing my grandma.

4415
03:39:47,840 --> 03:39:48,260
So...

4416
03:39:48,820 --> 03:39:49,240
Yes.

4417
03:39:53,120 --> 03:39:56,200
Yeah, but like I said, this might change a little bit because...

4418
03:39:56,200 --> 03:39:57,700
Oh, and all the times are wrong.

4419
03:39:57,760 --> 03:39:59,540
So please don't look at the times at the moment.

4420
03:39:59,620 --> 03:39:59,920
Oh, wait.

4421
03:40:02,580 --> 03:40:04,620
Actually, only Ghost Trick is wrong.

4422
03:40:04,820 --> 03:40:06,180
What time did I have Ghost Trick for?

4423
03:40:11,630 --> 03:40:15,050
Oh, Ghost Trick is actually 6pm EST.

4424
03:40:15,830 --> 03:40:18,030
And Atlantis no Nazo is actually...

4425
03:40:18,830 --> 03:40:19,390
2pm...

4426
03:40:20,570 --> 03:40:21,130
EST.

4427
03:40:21,430 --> 03:40:22,910
So it's just a little bit wrong.

4428
03:40:23,030 --> 03:40:23,690
Just a little bit wrong.

4429
03:40:25,390 --> 03:40:27,470
But yeah, I hadn't fixed that yet.

4430
03:40:27,670 --> 03:40:28,630
I need to...

4431
03:40:28,630 --> 03:40:29,970
I need to...

4432
03:40:30,730 --> 03:40:32,290
Get a schedule with Figma.

4433
03:40:33,030 --> 03:40:33,590
Because...

4434
03:40:34,170 --> 03:40:36,590
I'm so bad about changing the times.

4435
03:40:36,590 --> 03:40:37,930
It's my least favorite thing.

4436
03:40:39,910 --> 03:40:41,750
So I'll probably be...

4437
03:40:43,470 --> 03:40:44,650
Commissioning a new schedule.

4438
03:40:45,370 --> 03:40:47,490
So that I can use Figma again.
