Matara was just you all along.

18
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,450
What do you mean by that?

19
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,810
What if...

20
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,310
I blocked Matara right now.

21
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,530
What if I blocked her right now?

22
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,550

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,050
What the heck?

174
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,170
Oh, my shoes!

175
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,450
Can I change my shoes?

176
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,730
Oh, here we go.

177
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,690
And my socks.

178
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,190
I was already wearing the decorated thigh highs.

179
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,610
I didn't think I needed to change at all.

180
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,470
I was like, yeah, we're good.

181
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,850
Oh, my God.

182
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,670
I was just going to go out of my sandals.

183
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,770
Most self-aware, Minto, realizing she's cute after like five
years.

184
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,590
You're looking very blocky today.

185
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,630
I'll miss my birthday by a year.

186
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,470
Could I get a happy birthday from you even though I'm late?

187
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,510
How much is a year?

188
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,250
Like it's been one full year and it's your birthday again?

189
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,190
Aaron, happy birthday!

190
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,010
I wanna be in big old boots though.

191
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,410
I'm gonna make my ears bigger.

192
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,810
Wait, wrong place.

193
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:18,790
Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger.

194
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:19,610
Yeah.

195
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,250
Okay.

196
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,430
Hair highlights.

197
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,350
You can do that.

198
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,090
No.

199
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,030
I don't think so.

200
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,580
Doesn't look like it.

201
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,760
There's a health bar setting.

202
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,260
You might want on.

203
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,920
What does that mean?

204
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,460
I'm wearing boots now.

205
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,560
Yeah, I want the boots.

206
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,760
Wait, scroll down?

207
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:47,960
Wait.

208
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:48,740
No.

209
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,300
There's just more hair.

210
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,700
Whoa, what's this one?

211
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,400
Oh, it's so cute.

212
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,340
Wait, oh shoot, I lost the twin tails.

213
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,320
Wait, oh my gosh, it took so long, Matara left the call.

214
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,420
Wait, hold on.

215
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,160
No, this is it.

216
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,260
You guys, there's no hair.

217
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,940
There's no hair to anything.

218
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,820
I'm getting one guide for real.

219
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,220
There's no way.

220
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,020
Matara gave up.

221
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,390
Anyway.

222
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:25,670
Okay.

223
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,430
I call.

224
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,410
I call Matara.

225
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:27,790
All right.

226
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:28,570
Goodbye, everybody.

227
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,990
I call her now.

228
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,620
I wonder if she'll pick up.

229
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,700
I wonder if she'll pick up.

230
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,180
I wonder if she'll pick up.

231
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,500
I wonder if she'll pick up.

232
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Oh.

233
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,040

Nothing brings me more joy.

You're actually like, my deepest, darkest enemy.

248
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,420
Oh, yeah.

249
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,660
That's what they say.

250
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,220
Who needs enemies, like, when you have friends?

251
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,780
Friends like me.

252
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,680
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

253
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,020
Give war a chance.

254
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,320
You still have not played that game.

255
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,220
No, not yet.

256
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,720
I know.

257
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,540
But, you will.

258
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,840
But, I will.

259
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,860
It's been so long since we've collabed.

260
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,700
I feel like you should introduce yourself again.

261
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,460
Just in case.

262
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,660
Okay, so this is my...

263
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,720
I recently redid my introduction because, you know, like,
it's been...

264
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,240
Yeah, so it's a new introduction.

265
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:43,960
Oh, my God!

266
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,120
Kon-kon, konnichiwa!

267
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,380
Matadez!

268
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,500
Oh, hi-yo!

269
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,620
I am with Taraka, Nelvin, independent, and so cute.

270
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,360
That's me!

271
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,100
Yeah!

272
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm trying to go for a different demographic.

273
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,380
Oh, I could tell.

274
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,860
Do you think...

275
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,440
Do you think it's good?

276
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,800
Perfect.

277
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,300
All the momos are probably like, oh, that's our... Every day
we hear that same intro.

278
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,080
No, no, no.

279
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:22,980
It's...

280
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,100
Wait.

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,400

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,740
Oh, fuck, I fucked it up.

286
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,960
Okay, maybe it's too long.

287
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,060

It's like theater, you know?

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,040
Like things happen and you just got to go with it.

293

Exactly.

296
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,520
Since you two, it's been a while, by the way.

297
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,900
Congrats on your band.

298
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,200
Thanks.

299
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,580
My band.

300
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:10,020
so I don't know have you talked about like the conception
like like the birthing the baby make when it was in the womb

301
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:20,680
I think so I think I talked about how like you and I were
delirious and doing it no having it just sweaty sensual I

302
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:31,600
wonder what that room smelled like now that I'm thinking
back on it awesome we were locked in for like ever we were

303
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:39,980
locked in the same hotel room both of us sweating and
delirious from covid like just what um what did you tell

304
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:48,640
them uh i think i think i can't i think it was like
basically like you know we were i was like lamenting to you

305
00:22:48,640 --> 00:23:00,840
like i'm lonely my tarot and just like i was like sucks for
you too bad yeah pretty much we thrive off of each others

306
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:09,980
despair you know it's a mutual yeah but um just like uh i
was like i don't know what to do and then just being like oh

307
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:17,460
but what if i made my own group and then like how we went
how i would go how how i would be able to make that happen

308
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:25,380
happen yeah and you know that's exactly how oh no go ahead
yeah no that's exactly so um i think this is where like it

309
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,020
was kind of obviously it sucked that we got covet in japan
and we had to stay there extra but i think a good that came

310
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,960
from it from being very close friends and kind of being in
like this vulnerable state of delirium where all we had was

311
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,120
time yeah so we were kind of just you know that like part
where you're just talking about life and i think i probably

312
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,680
hate you with one of those are you happy are you really
happy what would make you happier like i i hate you with one

313
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:57,020
of those like and then i suddenly like sit down i lay down
on the couch and i'm like fold my i fold my hands together

314
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:03,960
i'm like well you know and you like pull out the notepad and
you're like okay yeah yeah yeah yeah i that's that's one of

315
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,000
those things that i feel when you know somebody very closely
and you're not afraid because sometimes when you're talking

316
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,160
to people that you don't know very close sometimes you're
like oh i would want this but you because we're so close

317
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:19,540
you're like i'm lonely i i would love to be part you're like
the happiest i was was being part of an ensemble like i love

318
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:27,420
that i i thrive off of you know my success is other people's
success i love like doing things together in and i was like

319
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,780
and i think i literally was like well why don't you do that.

320
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,720

It's me.

345
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,140
Chits, the ghost made.

346
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,160
Wait, you can't just like ghost Gryllix.

347
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,600
That's not gonna work.

348
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,360
Gryllix is copyrighted, but you can't just like That's just
dubstep.

349
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,380
That's just dubstep.

350
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,960
Everybody has the same beat.

351
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,700
I recognized it was Skrillex though.

352
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,780
Is it?

353
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,460
Yeah.

354
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,860
I want to hear it for real.

355
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,620
I think I spat all over the place.

356
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,080
Hold on.

357
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,100
Also, for a second though, I think you unlocked a new
laughter.

358
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,700
You kind of went like, it was very cute.

359
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,160
Thanks.

360
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,380
Now I'm scared to listen back and hear what I sounded like.

361
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,520
The wisps.

362
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,600
No!

363
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,340
How can you say it so easily?

364
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:36,840
It's okay.

365
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,760
I say wait it best.

366
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,100

00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:42,620
Oh, wait.

371
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,640
I say a lot of things wrong.

372
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,720
Wait, treadmill is correct.

373
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,560

379
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,140
Wait.

And I'm like, no, we're keeping Momo.

I'm honestly, I'm so happy.

450
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:04,380
I was telling the MOMOs too that like something, there's a
lot of people that don't thrive in collective environments

451
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,980
because they're like, they get very competitive or they're
like, this person's doing better than me.

452
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,180
This person's this and this.

You've never like, you know, it's just what it is.

It's just never progressed me off.

466
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,440
It doesn't have to be romantic.

467
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,020
You know, we're just girlfriend.

468
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,640

I love you more, Limeu.

475
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,220
I love you more.

476
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,480
Okay.

477
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,160
That's not true.

478
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,840
You know how obsessive I can be with my friendships and like
how giving I can be and loving.

479
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,760
I love Limeu.

480
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,700
I love Lymu too.

481
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,340
I love Lymu.

482
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,640
You're bullshit.

483
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,860
I love her more.

484
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,780
Oh my god.

485
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,360
Lymu just came to my chat, said not to cause discourse, but
I love you, Minto.

486
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,800
She said, love you, Mata.

487
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,660
Have a great stream.

488
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,720
She didn't tell you to have a great stream, bitch.

489
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,860
She's wishing for my fifth.

490
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,460
She's praying for my downfall.

491
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,420
What do you mean?

492
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,720
I take my love back.

493
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,320
I, you know, she's also a fellow short woman, right?

494
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:08,960
Yes.

495
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:10,980
Very cute.

496
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,280
I love her.

497
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,720
You know what I love about Lyme?

498
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,260
She's never mean to me like you are.

499
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,200
Oh, that's just how I show my love.

500
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,520
That is true.

501
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,900
I'm just saying.

502
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,280
She does sometimes kill me in video games though and it's
always when I never expected because I trust her so

503
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,980
wholeheartedly that if like it's the two of us and like an
among us situation I never believe that she's the traitor.

504
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,740
If we did like one of those games where it's like if one of
you's the traitor I would never believe that she is and she

505
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,060
would be and she'd be like sorry Mata.

506
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:48,980
You also I feel like I know you don't like those types of
games and so I feel like you just blindly want to trust

507
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,580
everybody that is your friend anyway.

508
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,280
Yeah I gotta do.

509
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:02,600
but also limeu is an absolute gamer so she scares me if i'm
against limeu i think i just want to lie down on the ground

510
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,860
and give up this is why like having her in games i know that
if i get bullied i just like release my my pocket limes i'm

511
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:24,920
like limes go pocket lives like as a as like ferret forms
perfect pokemon i think so i think so all right cutie is

512
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:31,520

because uh yeah i feel like a lot of my my audience knows

513
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:42,380
you i feel like some of your fans know me as well and if
they don't they're gonna oh i mean what did you make i do

514
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,680
want to have a i want to give a slight warning there's a
there's not a lot of jump scares in this game but there's a

515
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,220
few oh lately just a few Okay.

516
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,220
I know people are going to think I'm fake with my reactions.

517
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,640
I know, but I really do get scared easy.

518
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,340
Oh, oh, I know this.

519
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,160
I know this.

520
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,020
They might not know.

521
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,880
They might not know.

522
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,080
And I think, and maybe you can attest to this, I think some
people in real life also think that it's fake until they

523
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,520
meet me and they get, and they see me genuinely get scared.

524
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,960
They're like, oh, shit.

525
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,580
She's just like that.

526
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,300
She's a little moron.

527
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,900
I honestly can't feel how you would be faking it.

528
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,740
I'm not going to lie.

529
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:32,460
I'm just screaming I just feel like maybe because I've known
you for so long at this point I'm just like oh yeah that's

530
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:42,680
just that's the Tarah Conway yeah yeah some of my screams
lately have been I don't know it's been a long week oh my

531
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:52,800

for my language it was so scary and then I played Elden Ring

532
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,660
with Zen and I was getting like jump scared left right and
center because Elden Ring puts enemies like behind a crate

533
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,160
or behind a wall where you don't see them and then they show
up and backstab you.

534
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,200
Oh that's scary.

535
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,220
That's scary.

536
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:05,880
Yeah.

No.

539
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,600
That's why we get along.

540
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,920
These people with low neuroticism sometimes I'm like oh man
I gotta control my neuroticism.

560
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,320
Wait.

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,480
Oh, maybe I...

562
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Wait, I think I did the wrong one.

563
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,060
Wait, hold on.

564
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,420
Hold on.

565
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,040

566
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,740
Okay, hold on.

567
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,840
They're both very similar.

568
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,240
Okay.

569
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,640

SpongeBob.

628
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,540
I will say, though, the only sad part is when you put on
armor, it hides everything.

629
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,880
so I haven't been wearing armor.

630
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,380
Oh, okay, I won't either then.

We can go outside.

00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,060
I'll let you, I'll let you explore.

637
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,020

Oh, berries.

641
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,540
So far, so far feels and looks just like Minecraft.

642
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,500
It really does, yeah.

643
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,060
Minecraft, Minecraft.

644
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,780
one thing though, very cool.

645
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,660
Okay, you know how in Minecraft you need a mod to collect
the tree, right?

646
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,200
A mod to collect the tree.

647
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:29,680
What do you mean?

648
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,460
Like, you need a mod for the whole tree to fall.

649
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,040
Look, look, look.

650
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,080
I hit the bottom of the tree.

651
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Uh-huh.

652
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,020
Oh, I get what you mean.

653
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,440
It's a while.

654
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,460
Wait, there's like a big thing over here, Matara.

655
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,660
Yeah.

656
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,700
What's the big thing?

657
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,320
Look at that.

658
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,060
No.

659
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,800
Yeah, it's a village.

660
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,240
You want to go?

661
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:44,540
Yeah!

662
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,260
You want to go see what's up there?

663
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,280
Okay, let's go.

664
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,880
Oh, it's a village.

665
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,200
Oh, I think so.

666
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,640
I don't know.

667
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,440
I haven't seen this yet.

668
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,140
Okay.

669
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,200
Let's go.

670
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,660
Oh, there's stamina.

671
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,800
Oh, those are...

672
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,680
Wait, is there a carrot?

673
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,280
Oh, wait.

674
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,280
I don't think we can fight them.

675
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,480
I've never seen them before, but I don't think we should go.

676
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,880
Oh, I don't think we have.

677
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,340
Oh, God.

678
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,320
Okay.

679
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,300
They'll leave us alone, though, right?

680
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,460
Yeah.

681
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,620
And typically when I run away.

682
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,040
There's turkeys.

683
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,020
Wait.

684
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,140
Why are there bad guys in the daytime?

685
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,340
This is messed up.

686
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,180
Yeah, there are.

687
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,060
But when you go cave diving, there's less bad guys, which is
kind of nice.

688
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:21,460
What?

689
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,200
That's crazy.

690
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,120
Yeah.

691
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,100
I kind of like it.

692
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,200
Because I want to explore.

693
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,820
I don't want to fight bad guys.

694
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,280
I will protect you, my queen.

695
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,120
Wait, how'd you...

696
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,580
Wait, sorry, where?

697
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,080
How'd you make that?

698
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,720
Did you take damage?

699
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,980
Go into Tab.

700
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:34,640
Tab.

701
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,220
You've played a video game before, right?

702
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,720
No, never.

703
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,420
Oh, okay, I see it.

704
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:42,720
Yeah.

705
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,100
My first game ever, please be patient, everybody.

706
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,740
It's my first time.

707
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,280
Yeah.

708
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,180
This is actually my first day on Earth, actually.

709
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:54,900
I believe it.

710
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,080
Do you believe it?

711
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,300
I believe it.

712
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,900
What does it mean by any rubble?

713
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,000
What would be a rubble?

714
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:00,620
Okay.

715
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,240
A rubble.

716
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,140
Let me show you.

717
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,440
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.

718
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,100
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come.

719
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,560
So this is like you'll see these little blocks here.

720
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,900
So this is like stone rubble.

721
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:09,600
Oh, okay.

722
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,000

Look, look, look at the little mountain.

725

728
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,400
You have the big teeth and everything.

Right there.

730
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,560

We can like have a little fun.

740
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,160

00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:34,740
What?

744
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,560
Oh my god.

745
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,480
Yeah, I tell you.

746
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,480
Who's gonna win?

747
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,380
Oh, never mind.

748
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:39,640
Oh my god.

749
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,000
Wait, he just dies there.

750
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,480
Oh my god.

751
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:42,820
Oh.

752
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,660
What did you think was gonna happen?

753
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:44,960
I don't know.

754
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,120
Wait, I kind of want to kill the turkey.

755
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,700
There's deer and everything.

756
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,220
Yeah, the deer will run away though.

757
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,740
We gotta like... Oh, they're cute.

758
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,140
Oh dang, you're like going out.

759
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,040
Yeah, they're kind of harder to...

760
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,100
Kill him.

761
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,040
Oh, whoa, it's like Zelda.

762
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:57,780
Wait.

763
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,360
Oh, sorry.

764
00:44:59,140 --> 00:44:59,440
Sorry.

765
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,300
This is awakening your fighting instincts.

766
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,420
You gotta eat food to regenerate your health and stuff.

767
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,620
Oh, that's the same.

768
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,120
It's like...

769
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,480
Wait, we're gonna kill the Skelly over here?

770
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:10,780
Oh, yeah.

771
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,060
I'll kill the Skelly and then I'll come kill the Skelly with
you.

772
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,060
Harvest the mature.

773
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,320
Okay, I'm gonna kill the Skelly.

774
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,220
One thing this game does so well is the Salis.

775
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,520
Like, when things die, they're like...

776
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,060
Ow!

777
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,040

783
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:08,800
the enemies they'll spawn randomly but we don't have to like
really make a shelter for the night we should just because

784
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:17,680
you know but um i'm down to to make a little like small base

787

Oh my god.

791
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,640
This is one thing I love, like the way the character, like,
might have a little saliva coming from his mouth.

792
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,380
Oh god, I'm gonna die.

793
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,780
If you run away far from him, he, oh shit, I'm also.

794
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,260
I died.

795
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,920
Oh no!

796
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,480
It's okay, I'm coming back.

797
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,900
It's okay, I'm about to die.

798
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,980
Oh, I forgot to change it where you can't...

799
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,420
Oh, get him, get him.

800
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:14,940
I got him!

801
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,240
Where you don't lose your items.

802
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,000
That's okay though.

803
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,760
You lose some items.

804
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,720
I think if you have like too many items, you'll lose some.

805
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,440
Oh, I see it.

806
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,080

811
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,340
They'll be killing both.

812
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,840
Oh, my God.

813
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,080

Another time, another place.

1007
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,180
A word would only rhyme.

1008
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,880
There'd be a wrong embrace.

1009
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,320
He like, he sings like that.

1010
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:15,420
Yeah, yeah, he like sings the way that you like how a song
sounds.

1011
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,880
He does, he does.

1012
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,320
We'll sing another song.

1013
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,800
It'd be another one.

1014
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,400
Like, you want to prove me?

1015
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,180
Because she's like 20 years younger than him.

1016
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,160
And he's also got the AIDS, so...

1017
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,640
I thought she had the AIDS.

1018
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,080
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1019
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:31,840
She had the AIDS.

1020
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,160
Maybe they all have the AIDS.

1021
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,540
I don't know.

1022
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:33,960
It's rent.

1023
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,080
I think...

1024
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,400
Yeah.

1025
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,800

00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,540
I think so.

1027
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,000
Can you stop mooing, please?

1028
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:40,420

1029
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,080

00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,360
Who else could it be?

1033
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,640
They're so cute.

1034
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,320
It's not them.

1035
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,500
It's definitely them.

1036
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,120
Oh!

1037
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,780

1038
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,780

I'm... Are you a monster?

1047
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,240
That's not very nice.

1048
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,540
I already dug there.

1049
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,440
There was a treasure chest.

1050
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,400
Oh there was a treasure chest in the toilet.

1051
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,760
I thought it was a toilet but I think it was like hiding a
treasure chest.

1052
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,100
Oh.

1053
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,660

1054
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,840
Oh there's a... Yeah we could plant it.

1055
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,760
Look look look I want to go there.

1056
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,460
There's like a structure.

1057
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,620
Yeah I want to go there.

1058
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,800
I think I see another village too.

1059
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,500
Oh, look at the yaks.

1060
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,420
Oh, and the little baby yaks are so cute.

1061
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,540
You can kill the babies too.

1062
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,800
Wait, this place looks crazy.

1063
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,140
Wait, what's going on here?

1064
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,960
There's like a statue and everything.

1065
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:36,980
I'll say Robo.

1066
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,000
Oh, you're killing them.

1067
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,180
Oh, my God.

1068
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,220
It's my special ability.

1069
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,800
I have an essence of life.

1070
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,520
I wonder what that is.

1071
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,220
This is a brazier.

1072
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,260
This is a brazier.

1073
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,460
That's a brazier.

1074
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:52,360
Oh.

1075
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:52,920
This is a brazier.

1076
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,700
I'm eating.

1077
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,340
One second.

1078
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,860

1079
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:00,160
Yeah, yeah.

1080
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:00,960
She's taking her time.

1081
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,660
She's taking her time.

1082
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,020
Oh, this just looks like a campfire to me.

1083
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,960
But like, if you mine it, it's called a brazier.

1084
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,620
And they're like really, really cool.

1085
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,040
Because they're in like, wait, I'm mining it.

00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,580

1109
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,200
Do you think...

1110
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
He seems polite.

1111
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,260
Wait, is that a mimic?

1112
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,060
Did that thing just move?

1113
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,440
I think we got to get him.

1114
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:16,880
Oh, that's a mimic.

1115
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:17,280

Wait, so this is, like, a quest place?

Look at him.

01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,270
He looks like you if you had one eye.

1173
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,350
Why would you say that?

1174
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,510
Because he's short and he's green.

1175
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:37,970

01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:40,750

1249
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,450

They aggro on me for some reason.

1479
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,170
It's because you're stinky.

1480

01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:31,010

All right, let me take a look at M.

1628
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:43,670
We're next to these two.

1629
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:48,170
Oh, if you look down where we haven't been, there's like a
big...

1630
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:50,590
Oh, there's another forgotten temple gateway.

1631
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:51,210
Do you see it?

1632
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:53,170
No, I don't know where you are.

1633
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:53,610

1637
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,810
Okay, now look south from us.

1638
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:00,310
There's like a big fortress looking thing south from us.

1639
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:01,270
You see it?

1640
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:03,230
Oh, I see the tippy tip top of it.

1641
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:11,170
And then on the left, like on your map, and then on the
left, there's like a forgotten temple gateway.

1642
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:11,810
Ooh.

1643
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:12,710

1644
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,170
I'm not looking at the map.

1645
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,210
I'm just going to explore.

1646
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:18,130
Oh, oh, I was going to say, let's go towards them.

1647
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:18,930
Yeah, we can.

1648
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,870

1649
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:21,170
Hold on.

1650
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,170
Is there anything else up in this whole?

1651
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:25,010
No, I guess this is it.

1652
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:25,510
Wait.

1653
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:28,470
Wait, is this inside the tree?

1654
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:31,870
There's mushrooms growing inside the tree.

1655
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:36,410
This place is so cool though.

1656
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:37,210
I know.

1657
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:39,070
Oh, they're not really inside.

1658
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:39,490
All right.

1659
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:40,170

That's what I like.

1734
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:01,850
You kind of keep all the stuff on your toolbar and you lose
just like half of your stuff, which I like.

1735
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:03,710
It's not as punishing.

1736
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:05,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1737
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:08,190

The width.

1739
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,910
Are they very demanding when you're in a collab?

1740
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:17,890
Because sometimes we'll have some mommos being like, oh she

Oh, my God.

1767
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:11,230

01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:16,910
Oh, I know of it, but I've not seen it, though.

1771
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:18,370
You should watch it.

1772
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:19,650
Are you kidding me?

1773
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:20,850
Why?

1774
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:24,510
It's just got stuff you like.

01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:26,210
People sing.

1776
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:27,550

Don't.

1790
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:49,510
You should go there.

1791
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:50,350
You should go there.

1792
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:51,050
You should go there.

1793
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:51,950
You should go there.

1794
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,470
After you, after you, after you.

1798
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:00,230
Oh, look behind you.

This cave has iron.

1817
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:18,450
Okay.

1818
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:19,910

Okay, I'll just, I'll mine down to you.

01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,790
Just, just go down the hole that I did.

1821
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:25,730
You'll be safe.

1822
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:28,490
Yeah, but we need a way back up.

1823
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:30,610
We can just mine up.

1824
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:31,610
How do you not play Minecraft?

1825
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:32,730
You just mine your way up.

1826
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:36,370
I'm making a ladder so that we can, there we go.

1827
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:37,770
Oh, ladders were kind of weird.

1828
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:39,410
That's one of my big complaints.

1829
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:43,130
What I love about Minecraft is the water bucket and the rope
here.

1830
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,410
It doesn't look that way.

1831
01:30:45,490 --> 01:30:48,470
No, I'm hoping they add it on and change things up a little
because...

1832
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:50,090
Well, it's not supposed to be...

1833
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:51,130
Is this iron?

1834
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:53,350
It's not supposed to be Minecraft.

1835
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:56,350
Oh, you missed some!

1836
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:57,150
You missed some!

1837
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:58,270
Oh, get it?

1838
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:00,650
Oh, my God.

1839
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:05,970
I, like, in my game previously, I had such a hard time
finding iron, and here there's just iron everywhere.

1840
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:06,410
Everywhere.

1841
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:10,510
Matara's blind, everybody.

1842
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:11,850
There is a water bucket.

1843
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:12,950
Apparently.

1844
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:14,030
I have glasses.

1845
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:14,710
No!

1846
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:15,690
What?

1847
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:17,810
Wait, can I send you a photo?

1848
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:20,170
Wait, you have like actual glasses?

1849
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,930
Actual, okay, can I complain for three seconds?

1850
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:24,550
It's gonna be longer than three seconds.

1851
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:27,230
I bought Versace glasses, okay?

1852
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:27,730
Who?

1853
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:30,070
And Versace, you know?

1854
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:30,690
Versace.

1855
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:31,930
Versace.

1856
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:35,970
And, um, it was, you know, it was kind of like a nice
expensive pair.

1857
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:37,530
They were all special, but they were still expensive.

1858
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:41,370
They didn't even come with a little rag to like wipe the
glasses from like my earrings.

1859
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,390
Really?

1860
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:42,970
Yeah.

1861
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:45,530
Can you believe that?

1862
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:47,910
Okay, so first of all, Bad service.

1863
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,430
This is what I look like.

1864
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:52,410
And this is what I look like.

1865
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:53,070

1866
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,210
Hold on.

01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:56,450
A little nerd.

1868
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:58,010
You look like a little nerd.

1869
01:31:58,050 --> 01:31:58,690
Sorry I'm laughing so hard.

1870
01:31:58,910 --> 01:31:59,350
What the hell?

1871
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:01,570
You look like a little nerd.

1872
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:03,550
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

That is you.

1877
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:12,070
At least in like...

1878
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:13,870
Oh man, I should have taken a better picture.

1879
01:32:14,210 --> 01:32:16,950

Oh, why is he attacking me?

1889
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:18,410
Oh, sorry.

1890
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,530
Oh, you just hit me for a while.

1891
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:21,670
I know I did.

1892
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,870
My audience is saying you need to bully me more.

1893
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:26,350
They like when I'm getting bullied.

1894
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:28,230
Yeah, because it puts you in your place.

1895
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:29,450
It does.

1896
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:30,190
Wait, what's this?

1897
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:36,130
I've said it before, but like, it's always, when you play
with people that you don't really know, or like, if I meet

1898
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:38,770
friends for the first time, I'm not going to bully them
because it's rude.

1899
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:41,790
But when it's my pals, oh, you best leave.

1900
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,430
We know we can dish it and take it.

1901
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:47,910
I can't take it, actually.

1902
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:48,510
I'm sensitive.

1903
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:49,870
I'm not.

1904
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:56,170
Actually, I think this is also another reason why, like,
because we're close friends, sometimes, like, it's been a

1905
01:33:56,170 --> 01:34:01,370
bit if, like, sometimes I remember in Japan, we're like, you
tease me or I tease you and the other would be like, okay.

1906
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:02,330
Not today.

1907
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:04,850
I'm actually really sensitive today.

1908
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:06,090
Wait, is it gone?

1909
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:07,110
I think also it takes.

1910
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:08,090
Oh, I'm sorry.

1911
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:08,590
It's okay.

1912
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:10,250
It's okay.

1913
01:34:10,350 --> 01:34:11,130
She'll never forgive me.

1914
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:11,910
It's okay.

1915
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:13,110
I'm just, I'm ready to go.

1916
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:13,470
You know what?

1917
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:14,890
It's fine.

1918
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:15,810
Yeah, anyway.

1919
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:16,730
Orc invasion.

1920
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:17,670
I know.

1921
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:18,210
Is that that guy?

1922
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:19,310
He kind of looks like a frog.

1923
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:21,330
No, I definitely think he's an orc.

1924
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:22,610
Oh, there's a fishy.

1925
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:23,410
Look how goofy.

1926
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:25,670
Look how nasty this fish looks though.

1927
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:27,030
Kill it.

1928
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:29,690
Wait, can we just grab it like that or do we have to fight
it?

1929
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:31,090
Oh my god, it's a little piranha.

1930
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:33,490
Oh, he's gonna eat you.

1931
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:35,370
I'm gonna eat him.

1932
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:36,970
I'm the apex predator.

1933
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:40,810
Wait, where'd that thing go?

1934
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:41,550
Where'd he go?

1935
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:42,870
It was huge.

1936
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:43,930
Look, there's so huge.

1937
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:45,050
Look at them.

1938
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:45,970
The little goblins.

1939
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:48,050
Oh my god, they're really small.

1940
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:51,290
Goblin scrapper.

1941
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:53,170
He's got his teeth.

1942
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:54,910
Wait, they look so nerdy.

1943
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:56,730
Oh, they do.

1944
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:57,850
They hit hard.

1945
01:34:58,630 --> 01:34:58,950
They do.

1946
01:34:59,090 --> 01:34:59,150
Is it that way?

1947
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:00,030
And they make little noises.

1948
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:01,470
Is it this guy?

1949
01:35:01,710 --> 01:35:02,430
Look, he's like a Merlot.

1950
01:35:02,650 --> 01:35:04,050
I'm telling you, it's this guy.

1951
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:05,670
Ah!

1952
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:06,570
He hit hard.

1953
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:08,730
It's this guy, right?

1954
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:09,090
What?

1955
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:09,670

1956
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:10,550
No, no, no.

01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:12,170
Mine looked like a...

1958
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:13,090

1959
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:13,470

Oh, wait.

He rushed at me, but I don't think he did.

1967
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:52,550

1969
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:54,870

He didn't know that.

01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:10,390
I went somewhere with Junie, and she was like, oh, it's an
ardvark.

01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:12,370
And I thought she was, like, making words up.

maid cafe first of all.

But second of all, they're going to be down for any
experience.

1999
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:02,930
They're very much like we want to, you know, embrace the

that without you because you have to like book the tickets

Oh, I got sucked into the teleport!

2020
01:38:51,610 --> 01:38:55,650
This is, like, I swear, I'm showing you that I got, like,
it, like, actually errored me.

2021
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:56,670
Whoa, wait, hold on.

2022
01:38:56,890 --> 01:39:00,410
Also, yes, my PC is named after my first corporal character.

2023
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:01,910
Because I got my PC when I'm...

2024
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:03,730
Oh, no!

2025
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:05,150
And I was so scared, like...

2026
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:07,530
I'll just jump back in.

2027
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:08,430
I think so.

2028
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:08,810
I think so.

2029
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:09,230
Yeah, I think so.

2030
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:12,710
I don't know why it, like, crashed me.

2031
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:13,830
But yeah, I sent you what it looks like.

2032
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:15,030
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

2033
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:23,590
But yeah, I think it would be so fun if, um, if, uh, I just
want them to experience it.

2034
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:26,490
And they told me that they're, you know, they're down for
the adventure.

2035
01:39:26,590 --> 01:39:27,870
They want to try the fun stuff.

2036
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,290
Okay.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2039
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:36,170
They might only come for, like, an hour of the show and then

02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:23,480
Are you fighting them?

2558
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:25,680
Accidentally, I did attack him.

2559
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,360
Oh, oops.

There's a war.

2563
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:31,680
There's like a little bone guy that's attacking the ferret
people.

2564
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:32,840
What is going on?

2565
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,080
It's an all-out war.

2566
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,260
A copper grieves.

2567
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:38,660
Okay, do you remember where my house is?

2568
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:39,120
Look, look, look.

2569
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:40,600
Oh, they're fighting each other at my house.

2570
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:41,420
They are?

2571
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:43,420
Oh, okay, well, he just killed him.

2572
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:43,980
See, he killed him.

2573
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:44,460
That was not me.

2574
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:44,820

2575
02:01:44,860 --> 02:01:45,580
Oh, my God.

2579
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,680
Is that the flying tentacle?

2580
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:50,280
No, no, no, no, no.

2581
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:52,140
I did see a big gopher.

2582
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:54,220
A big guy like floating in the sky.

2583
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:55,320
Oh, over there, yeah.

2587
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:58,640
Should we go get him?

2588
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:00,240
We can try.

2589
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,420
Let me just kill this guy first.

2590
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:04,460
This guy was killing all the little fox people.

2591
02:02:04,620 --> 02:02:05,740
Oh, no, he was killing him?

2592

02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:48,340
What'd you do?

2948
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:49,260
No.

2949
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:49,620
Would you kill?

2950
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:50,500
Nothing.

2951
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:50,940
What'd you do?

2952
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:51,960
Be honest.

2953
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:53,200
I won't judge.

2954
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:54,020
You know I won't judge.

I broke his little...

2960
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:01,600
Yeah, I broke his spirit.

2961
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:04,300
I broke his...

2962
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:06,680
I broke his red shiny item.

2963
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:07,520
Uh, the...

2964
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:08,720
the glowy stone.

2965
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:11,140
As long as you don't break him.

2966
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:13,500

02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:48,760
Hive soil.

2972
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:49,700
Hive soil.

2973
02:18:49,820 --> 02:18:52,020
That way I can like my little bugs in our bay.

2974
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:53,720
Whoa, look at this guy!

2975
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:58,660
He's like a scorpion, but he's got like a skull for a face.

2976
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,560
Oh, the skull ones are typically bad guys.

2977
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:02,440
They're baddies.

2978
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:03,900
No.

2979
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:08,060
Oh, that's what's hurting me.

2980
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:08,940
Oh, there's a hyena!

2981
02:19:09,980 --> 02:19:10,500
Hyena!

He's so cute!

2983
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,480
Oh, he's dangerous.

2984
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:18,400
I don't know.

2985
02:19:18,480 --> 02:19:19,460
I could have told you that.

2986
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:20,940
Hey.

2987
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:25,300

Oh, come on.

2991
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:33,900
Where am I?

2992
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:34,800
Oh, I'm back home.

2993
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:36,800
You're going to respawn into the... I'm close.

2994
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:37,680
Yeah, yeah.

2995
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:38,720
I know where you are.

2996
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:40,760
Oh, stay away from me.

2997
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:42,520
Ew, Batara.

2998
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:43,260
Ew.

2999
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:44,320
Ew, Batara.

3000
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:45,180
Ew.

3001
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:48,910
Oh, well, the armadillo.

3002
02:19:50,030 --> 02:19:50,450
I'm here.

3003
02:19:50,670 --> 02:19:51,110
Armadillo.

3004
02:19:52,230 --> 02:19:52,670
Armadillo.

3005
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:54,130
Wait, ow.

3006
02:19:54,730 --> 02:19:55,290
Why did you harm?

3007
02:19:55,510 --> 02:19:56,310
No, it's these.

3008
02:19:56,410 --> 02:19:57,710
It's these guys right here.

3009
02:19:58,350 --> 02:19:59,710
Look, Fiddy, what did Fiddy do?

3010
02:19:59,870 --> 02:20:02,870
Oh, you're going to love these mushrooms and flowers, girl.

3011
02:20:05,330 --> 02:20:07,970
Ew, these sounds so gross here.

3012
02:20:09,910 --> 02:20:10,350
Whoa.

3013
02:20:10,970 --> 02:20:13,470
Oh, the blood cap mushroom.

3014
02:20:14,810 --> 02:20:15,070
Take him.

3015
02:20:15,130 --> 02:20:15,530
You should take him.

3016
02:20:16,450 --> 02:20:16,690
All right.

3017
02:20:16,770 --> 02:20:17,390
I won't take the heart.

3018
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:17,890
hive soil.

3019
02:20:18,590 --> 02:20:21,470
When I live in my own home, I'll take them, but otherwise,
you know.

3020
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:22,010
Yeah.

3021
02:20:22,270 --> 02:20:23,650
Maybe you can make this your home.

3022
02:20:24,670 --> 02:20:24,770
Ah.

3023
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:26,010
No.

3024
02:20:26,350 --> 02:20:27,070
Too many enemies.

3025
02:20:27,470 --> 02:20:27,870
Are you sure?

3026
02:20:28,030 --> 02:20:29,770
I'd rather live with you, believe it or not.

3027
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:31,350
Oh, I don't believe that.

3028
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:32,890
I know.

3029
02:20:34,490 --> 02:20:35,010
Desert chick.

3030
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:35,670
Look, look, look.

3031
02:20:35,850 --> 02:20:37,370
It literally calls it desert chick.

3032
02:20:37,630 --> 02:20:38,310
Bit, bit, bit, come here.

3033
02:20:38,810 --> 02:20:39,370
And then look at it.

3034
02:20:39,430 --> 02:20:39,810
Desert chick.

3035
02:20:40,330 --> 02:20:41,210
Oh, my God.

3036
02:20:41,370 --> 02:20:42,590
Wait, it's so cute.

3037
02:20:45,070 --> 02:20:46,130
Wait, it's so cute.

3038
02:20:47,430 --> 02:20:52,450
It kind of looks like it's got like teeth around its neck,
almost like prehistoric style, if that makes sense.

3039
02:20:52,970 --> 02:20:55,630
I get what you mean, but I don't think that's the intention.

3040
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:56,630
I think that's just feathers.

3041
02:20:56,890 --> 02:20:57,030
No, no, no.

3042
02:20:58,750 --> 02:20:59,890
What else is in here?

3043
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:00,250
Wow.

3044
02:21:01,150 --> 02:21:02,030
The desert.

3045
02:21:03,050 --> 02:21:05,350
I see something blue, and I'm locked in.

3046
02:21:05,890 --> 02:21:06,770
Yep, yep, I'm following.

3047
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:08,350
Do you see the blue?

3048
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:10,030
I see the blue.

3049
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:12,590
I see a little blue.

3050
02:21:13,830 --> 02:21:15,310
Little blue, little blue.

3051
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:17,390
What could you do?

3052
02:21:17,410 --> 02:21:21,110
Oh, they're mushrooms, I think.

3053
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:22,590
Oh, I got the sound.

3054
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:24,130
Wait, look below.

3055
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:26,650
Wait, stop.

3056
02:21:26,990 --> 02:21:27,250
What?

3057
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:28,350
What is this?

3058
02:21:29,210 --> 02:21:30,030
Okay, you know what?

3059
02:21:30,150 --> 02:21:30,810
It's an egg sack.

3060
02:21:31,070 --> 02:21:31,990
It's an egg sack.

3061
02:21:36,330 --> 02:21:37,290
Oh, God.

3062
02:21:37,830 --> 02:21:38,890
Oh, you were right.

3063
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:39,650
It's an egg sack.

02:24:49,730 --> 02:24:49,730
Look!

3137
02:24:50,030 --> 02:24:50,750
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

3138
02:24:50,810 --> 02:24:51,050
Hold on.

3139
02:24:51,110 --> 02:24:51,630
Come look at this.

3140
02:24:51,730 --> 02:24:52,930
Wait, unless I killed them all.

3141
02:24:53,130 --> 02:24:53,130
Wait.

3142
02:24:54,490 --> 02:24:55,710
No, did I kill them all?

3143
02:24:56,030 --> 02:24:56,250
Dang it.

3144
02:24:56,250 --> 02:24:57,610
You're going to chop the roots or they're going to hurt us.

3145
02:24:57,630 --> 02:24:57,910
I know.

3146
02:24:58,090 --> 02:24:58,750
That's what I was doing.

3147
02:25:00,450 --> 02:25:01,690
Dang it, I killed them all.

3148
02:25:01,830 --> 02:25:02,010
Ah!

3149
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:05,230
Uh-oh, I'm about to die again.

3150
02:25:05,330 --> 02:25:07,670
This is such a spooky area.

3151
02:25:07,810 --> 02:25:08,850
I love it.

3152
02:25:09,310 --> 02:25:11,230

3153
02:25:12,290 --> 02:25:13,090

02:25:14,610 --> 02:25:15,450
Yeah, it's fun.

3156
02:25:15,490 --> 02:25:16,670
I don't care.

3157
02:25:18,770 --> 02:25:22,050
Okay, so if they're not hatched, the egg sack is when you
can pick it up.

3158
02:25:22,190 --> 02:25:23,210
Oh, what the heck was that?

3159
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:24,590
I'm bringing them home.

3160
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:25,550
I'm going to hatch them home.

3161
02:25:25,690 --> 02:25:26,690
We're going to have little bugs.

3162
02:25:26,850 --> 02:25:28,330
Yeah, you'll have your own little bug army.

3163
02:25:29,530 --> 02:25:31,310
This area is quite spooky.

3164
02:25:31,630 --> 02:25:32,370
Look, it keeps going.

3165
02:25:32,650 --> 02:25:33,110
Oh, shoot.

3166
02:25:33,610 --> 02:25:34,570

02:25:35,690 --> 02:25:35,930
Oh, yeah.

3169
02:25:37,070 --> 02:25:39,390
I kind of don't want to go down down there.

3170
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:39,870
No, me neither.

3171
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:42,170
I'm not going to lie.

3172

It looks like a volcano.

3246
02:29:53,170 --> 02:29:53,650
You see it?

3247
02:29:54,010 --> 02:29:54,290
Let's go.

3248
02:29:54,490 --> 02:29:54,970
I'll follow you.

3249
02:29:55,130 --> 02:29:56,410
I'm not sure which one you're pointing at.

3250
02:29:56,670 --> 02:29:57,070
I'll go.

3251
02:29:57,330 --> 02:29:58,090
Where's my marker?

3252
02:29:59,230 --> 02:30:00,490
I will follow you into the dark.

3253
02:30:00,610 --> 02:30:01,430
What is the marker?

3254
02:30:01,770 --> 02:30:04,610
Like, I put it, but I don't see it like on my map.

3255
02:30:05,930 --> 02:30:07,330
I think you got a...

3256
02:30:07,890 --> 02:30:08,510
I don't know.

3257
02:30:10,150 --> 02:30:10,550
I don't know.

3258
02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:12,250
There's a parrot!

3259
02:30:14,290 --> 02:30:14,650
Oh!

3260
02:30:14,670 --> 02:30:15,690
Oh, yeah, you're right.

3261
02:30:15,930 --> 02:30:16,410
He's cute.

3262
02:30:17,190 --> 02:30:18,330
Are we, like, swimming?

3263
02:30:18,650 --> 02:30:19,210
I think so.

3264
02:30:19,770 --> 02:30:20,610
In the swamps?

3265
02:30:21,550 --> 02:30:22,570
We're going to be so stinky.

3266
02:30:23,630 --> 02:30:24,630
That's a mud bath.

3267
02:30:24,790 --> 02:30:25,450
What are you talking about?

3268
02:30:26,030 --> 02:30:27,090
Okay, okay, mister.

3269
02:30:30,530 --> 02:30:32,950
I like how they only aggro on one person.

3270
02:30:33,070 --> 02:30:33,810
I think that's pretty funny.

3271
02:30:34,030 --> 02:30:34,910
Yeah, me too.

3272
02:30:35,170 --> 02:30:35,870
Also, be careful.

3273
02:30:35,970 --> 02:30:38,010
There's, like, big bugs flying with green on them.

3274
02:30:38,110 --> 02:30:39,970
They're the ones who were, like, throwing poison at me.

3275
02:30:40,130 --> 02:30:41,070
Oh, okay, okay.

3276
02:30:43,890 --> 02:30:44,650
Oh, oh.

3277
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:46,730
Okay, just kidding.

3278
02:30:47,010 --> 02:30:52,590
The thing that I was seeing before on the map is the same
thing that we just went inside, just like another bug hive.

3279
02:30:53,930 --> 02:30:54,330
Okay.

3280
02:30:55,430 --> 02:30:57,850
Dude, the bug hive was so cool.

3281
02:30:59,830 --> 02:31:00,230
Crazy.

3282
02:31:01,590 --> 02:31:05,850
Do you want to just traverse the desert and go through it
and see what's on the other side of it?

3283
02:31:05,890 --> 02:31:06,270
Yeah.

3284
02:31:06,990 --> 02:31:07,350
We should.

3285
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:07,810
Okay.

3286
02:31:09,670 --> 02:31:10,910
Let's go this way then.

3287
02:31:11,150 --> 02:31:12,510
Oh, I need him.

3288
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:13,090
I need...

3289
02:31:13,090 --> 02:31:14,550
Wait, is that a flamingo?

3290
02:31:14,670 --> 02:31:30,810
where flying there's a pink bird where it's a flamingo it's
a flamingo turn around which side east west and uh south

3291
02:31:30,810 --> 02:31:38,110
south oh i see you and the flamingo i want to wow it is a
flamingo

3292
02:31:45,970 --> 02:31:46,370
Cool.

3293
02:31:46,930 --> 02:31:47,090
All right.

3294
02:31:47,230 --> 02:31:48,110
I take it back.

3295
02:31:48,270 --> 02:31:49,670
At first, I was like, yeah, it's okay.

3296
02:31:49,930 --> 02:31:54,190
I was comparing it too much to Minecraft, but the
adventuring so far has been...

3297
02:31:54,190 --> 02:31:54,650
Fun.

3298
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:55,810
It's been fun.

3299
02:31:56,170 --> 02:31:56,910
Stay away from me.

3300
02:31:57,650 --> 02:31:58,050
Yeah.

3301
02:31:58,310 --> 02:32:02,170
No, let's go to the east so we can traverse the desert.

3302
02:32:02,450 --> 02:32:02,730
Okay.

3303
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:03,470
East.

3304
02:32:03,610 --> 02:32:03,970
Let's go.

3305
02:32:04,230 --> 02:32:04,670
Let's go.

3306
02:32:05,450 --> 02:32:06,450
Oh, look at the tree.

3307
02:32:06,490 --> 02:32:09,590
I think it's called, like, a baobab tree that are native to
Africa.

3308
02:32:10,290 --> 02:32:12,530
You see that thing at the end there?

3309
02:32:12,810 --> 02:32:14,250
Maybe I'm having the wrong tree name.

3310
02:32:14,730 --> 02:32:15,770
How cool is that?

3311
02:32:16,130 --> 02:32:16,930
Just the big tree.

3312
02:32:17,390 --> 02:32:18,530
There's palm trees!

3313
02:32:19,450 --> 02:32:20,250
Palm trees!

3314
02:32:20,410 --> 02:32:21,590
Wait, that's so cool!

3315
02:32:21,790 --> 02:32:22,830
Stay away from me, hyena.

3316
02:32:23,410 --> 02:32:25,890
Yeah, hyena might aggro, but if he does, we don't got to
fight him.

3317
02:32:26,050 --> 02:32:26,250
No.

3318
02:32:26,390 --> 02:32:27,950
Oh my gosh, how cute!

3319
02:32:28,450 --> 02:32:29,950
Oh my god!

3320
02:32:33,030 --> 02:32:33,830
It's a...

3321
02:32:33,830 --> 02:32:35,050
Is it a baby cheetah?

3322
02:32:35,770 --> 02:32:36,670
Oh my god.

3323
02:32:36,950 --> 02:32:37,290
Is it?

3324
02:32:37,330 --> 02:32:37,950
What is it?

3325
02:32:38,150 --> 02:32:38,850
Was it a monkey?

3326
02:32:38,990 --> 02:32:39,610
I can't tell.

3327
02:32:40,270 --> 02:32:41,010
What is it?

3328
02:32:41,070 --> 02:32:41,950
It's a lemur, maybe?

3329
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:43,410
A mure cat.

3330
02:32:43,450 --> 02:32:44,630
Mure cat, I mean, a mure cat.

3331
02:32:45,030 --> 02:32:45,690
Oh my god.

3332
02:32:48,490 --> 02:32:49,330
Oh my god.

3333
02:32:49,330 --> 02:32:50,450
That's so cute.

3334
02:32:50,450 --> 02:32:50,750
He's so cute.

3335
02:32:51,570 --> 02:32:52,290
I love.

3336
02:32:52,570 --> 02:32:54,190
Let's go to the palm trees.

3337
02:32:54,330 --> 02:32:56,730
I want to see if there's any different birds, fish,
anything.

3338
02:32:56,990 --> 02:32:58,190
There's a tiger.

3339
02:32:58,790 --> 02:32:59,410
You can find him.

3340
02:32:59,510 --> 02:32:59,950
We can get him.

3341
02:33:00,190 --> 02:33:00,650
I don't see.

3342
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:01,770
Oh, I do see a tent.

3343
02:33:02,670 --> 02:33:02,950
Wait.

3344
02:33:03,070 --> 02:33:03,430
Wait.

3345
02:33:03,770 --> 02:33:04,790
Help me find the tiger, please.

3346
02:33:04,950 --> 02:33:05,170
Okay.

3347
02:33:07,530 --> 02:33:07,930
Oh.

3348
02:33:16,690 --> 02:33:18,710
Oh, he sounded so...

3349
02:33:18,710 --> 02:33:20,170
He said...

3350
02:33:20,170 --> 02:33:21,150
I know.

3351
02:33:21,850 --> 02:33:23,010
He's just like, okay, boo.

3352
02:33:24,190 --> 02:33:25,890
What's the blue place?

3353
02:33:26,330 --> 02:33:27,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3354
02:33:27,330 --> 02:33:29,570
I wonder if it's a block or if it's a real thing.

3355
02:33:29,770 --> 02:33:31,510
And I'm also gonna loot this tent.

3356
02:33:32,010 --> 02:33:32,630
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3357
02:33:32,690 --> 02:33:37,350
Whoever left this tent here, your mom's, you know, it's our
tent now.

3358
02:33:39,170 --> 02:33:40,110
What'd you say about her?

02:33:40,810 --> 02:33:41,670

3360
02:33:41,770 --> 02:33:42,530
What'd you say about mama?

3361
02:33:43,510 --> 02:33:43,870

Nope.

3382
02:34:40,730 --> 02:34:41,550
You didn't take the Braziers.

3383
02:34:41,790 --> 02:34:42,010

I'm digging.

02:35:42,990 --> 02:35:43,950
Like, you know, it's whatever.

3392
02:35:44,230 --> 02:35:44,870
It's a digging game.

3393
02:35:44,970 --> 02:35:46,850
I think it's because it's like there's so...

3394
02:35:46,850 --> 02:35:49,250
It's like it's a whole new experience.

3395
02:35:49,710 --> 02:35:50,510
Like, what that...

3396
02:35:50,510 --> 02:35:51,610
Oh, that's a scorpion again.

3397
02:35:53,010 --> 02:35:55,810
Think of all the, like, customization you can do in your
home.

3398
02:35:55,810 --> 02:35:56,190
Yeah.

3399
02:35:56,970 --> 02:35:57,930
Like, wow.

3400
02:35:58,350 --> 02:36:00,210
I'm looking at the map now.

3401
02:36:00,770 --> 02:36:01,110
Yeah.

3402
02:36:01,390 --> 02:36:02,390
Which way do you want to go, Pookie?

3403
02:36:02,670 --> 02:36:05,270
I'm seeing if there's, like, any...

3404
02:36:05,270 --> 02:36:06,810
I wonder if that's one.

3405
02:36:08,930 --> 02:36:10,610
I will kill this spider for you.

3406
02:36:10,690 --> 02:36:11,770
Okay, thank you.

3407
02:36:11,930 --> 02:36:15,490
I don't know what a temple looks like, to be honest.

3408
02:36:15,630 --> 02:36:17,370
It's not like a little whirlpool.

3409
02:36:17,650 --> 02:36:19,190
I didn't see any on the map right now.

3410
02:36:19,210 --> 02:36:19,550
Oh, you didn't?

3411
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:19,870
Okay.

3412
02:36:21,450 --> 02:36:23,010
Oh, I see like a village though.

3413
02:36:23,170 --> 02:36:23,990
I could try going to that.

3414
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:25,410
Or maybe like a fortress.

3415
02:36:25,610 --> 02:36:25,830
Who knows?

3416
02:36:26,210 --> 02:36:28,270
You know, one health potion.

3417
02:36:28,910 --> 02:36:30,010
Um, I'm out.

3418
02:36:31,650 --> 02:36:34,990
Uh, but, um, hold on.

3419
02:36:35,030 --> 02:36:37,910
I have a raw meat if you want to cook it.

3420
02:36:38,310 --> 02:36:39,430
We can cook the meats after.

3421
02:36:39,910 --> 02:36:40,670
Uh, you know what?

3422
02:36:40,690 --> 02:36:42,170
I have bad news.

3423
02:36:42,270 --> 02:36:46,510
I think we should slaughter the fauna and the flora just
because I think you're right.

3424
02:36:46,650 --> 02:36:49,290
I'm going to need some... We're going to need some food.

3425
02:36:51,510 --> 02:36:52,410
Okay, who the...

3426
02:36:52,890 --> 02:36:54,150
Oh, the Entelopees.

3427
02:36:54,350 --> 02:36:55,310
They actually attacked back.

3428
02:36:56,310 --> 02:36:56,710
Entelopees.

3429
02:36:56,850 --> 02:36:57,370
What are they on?

3430
02:36:59,230 --> 02:37:00,170
What is this?

3431
02:37:00,970 --> 02:37:01,850
Oh, those coconuts?

3432
02:37:02,750 --> 02:37:04,150
Whoa, wait, what they are.

3433
02:37:04,250 --> 02:37:05,550
Is that what fell on my head then?

3434
02:37:05,730 --> 02:37:06,130
Probably.

3435
02:37:06,410 --> 02:37:07,390
Did it hurt you?

3436
02:37:08,450 --> 02:37:08,850
Yeah.

3437
02:37:09,610 --> 02:37:12,750
Oh my god, It is a coconut and it does the health regen.

3438
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:15,690
Wait, how much?

3439
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:19,050
I'm just eating a whole coconut.

3440
02:37:19,330 --> 02:37:19,830
That's crazy.

3441
02:37:20,070 --> 02:37:21,410
Yeah, I'm in that coconut.

3442
02:37:22,790 --> 02:37:23,890
Blink it all up.

3443
02:37:24,250 --> 02:37:27,650
Oh, it's health regen one so it's not too crazy but it's
better than nothing.

3444
02:37:27,970 --> 02:37:29,090
Better than nothing, yeah.

3445
02:37:29,470 --> 02:37:32,110
Oh my god, look how cute the parrot is.

3446
02:37:32,490 --> 02:37:33,710
Oh, actually the health regen is cute.

3447
02:37:34,090 --> 02:37:34,910
Whoa, the parrot.

3448
02:37:37,350 --> 02:37:39,030
I like how he's parrying me.

3449
02:37:42,550 --> 02:37:45,330
I'm like, you're missing your backside, buddy.

3450
02:37:49,880 --> 02:37:52,180
Is that what you thought they were attacking you back?

3451
02:37:52,380 --> 02:37:54,180
But it was really just the coconut attacking you.

3452
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:55,260
Wait, wait, wait.

3453
02:37:55,420 --> 02:37:56,140
Does this mean wait?

3454
02:37:56,580 --> 02:37:56,820
Mint?

3455
02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:58,860
The coconuts give really good health regen.

3456
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:00,820
Did they?

3457
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:03,060
Yeah, I think so.

3458
02:38:04,660 --> 02:38:06,140
Let's loot some coconuts while we're here.

3459
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:06,620
Okay.

3460
02:38:07,020 --> 02:38:07,580
I have four.

3461
02:38:07,760 --> 02:38:08,020
Coconut.

3462
02:38:08,440 --> 02:38:09,780
Coconut, coconut, coconut, coconut.

3463
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:18,970
Do you know the Japanese word for coconut?

3464
02:38:20,250 --> 02:38:20,690
Coconuts.

3465
02:38:22,750 --> 02:38:27,490
The reason I'm asking is because I was collabing with Hany
and I asked her the Japanese word for clown.

3466
02:38:27,930 --> 02:38:29,150
She said it's Piero.

3467
02:38:30,210 --> 02:38:32,690
Which is a really, it's like the most famous French clown.

3468
02:38:32,830 --> 02:38:33,410
Yeah, Piero.

3469
02:38:33,610 --> 02:38:33,950
Yeah, yeah.

3470
02:38:34,470 --> 02:38:35,370
I was like, wait, really?

3471
02:38:35,590 --> 02:38:38,450
Like that, the word for clown is just like a famous French
clown?

3472
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:40,950
The famous French clown.

3473
02:38:41,970 --> 02:38:43,710
Oh, he does kick back.

3474
02:38:44,570 --> 02:38:45,450
Yeah, a little bit.

3475
02:38:46,310 --> 02:38:47,830
He's like John Clown of Clown.

3476
02:38:48,190 --> 02:38:50,590
John Clown, the CEO of Clown.

3477
02:38:52,250 --> 02:38:57,230
Wait, because this place is a whip, do you want to, like,
make this our base right now?

3478
02:38:57,730 --> 02:38:58,210
Sure.

3479
02:38:58,890 --> 02:39:03,030
We could just, like, kind of mine it a bit and, like, just
take over.

3480
02:39:04,210 --> 02:39:04,450
Yeah.

3481
02:39:04,990 --> 02:39:08,730
We can even, like, and he has doors, and I can put the
braziers?

3482
02:39:09,070 --> 02:39:09,310
Yeah.

3483
02:39:10,010 --> 02:39:12,330
Wait, if I mine more...

3484
02:39:12,330 --> 02:39:12,690
Uh-huh.

3485
02:39:13,290 --> 02:39:14,170
Oh, never mind.

3486
02:39:14,290 --> 02:39:14,570
Don't...

3487
02:39:14,570 --> 02:39:15,850
Oh, I made a window.

3488
02:39:16,630 --> 02:39:18,030
Oh, just close it back.

3489
02:39:18,170 --> 02:39:18,710
Wait, hold on.

3490
02:39:18,810 --> 02:39:19,630

These beds I have are kind of big.

3498
02:39:33,310 --> 02:39:35,930

Stinking bees.

3581
02:46:48,570 --> 02:46:49,230
Ouch, ouch.

3582
02:46:49,650 --> 02:46:49,650
Stop!

3583
02:46:50,930 --> 02:46:52,250
Good for the environment.

3584
02:46:52,710 --> 02:46:53,390
Oh, I'm hiding back.

3585
02:46:53,410 --> 02:46:55,210
behind a tree and he's still getting me.

3586
02:46:55,210 --> 02:46:56,750
Come on, come on, come on.

3587
02:46:56,850 --> 02:46:58,490
Oh into the environment, men.

3588
02:46:58,590 --> 02:46:59,530
How do you kill the bees?

3589
02:46:59,690 --> 02:47:00,630
How do you kill the bees?

3590
02:47:02,210 --> 02:47:03,030
I'm gonna die.

3591
02:47:04,670 --> 02:47:06,810

I think she's doing it.

3596
02:47:12,170 --> 02:47:13,050
I think it's a bit.

3597
02:47:15,310 --> 02:47:19,550
I have broken things in my inventory, you should repair
them.

3598
02:47:19,890 --> 02:47:20,930

3600
02:47:25,770 --> 02:47:27,370

3602
02:47:33,570 --> 02:47:35,010
I do have a bow, actually.

3603
02:47:35,290 --> 02:47:36,090
I do have a bow.

3604
02:47:36,230 --> 02:47:37,510
I'm gonna try using it.

3605
02:47:39,830 --> 02:47:40,190

And then I'm gonna give you a repair kit for it.

3613
02:47:49,310 --> 02:47:52,290
So when this pickaxe breaks, it doesn't break.

3614
02:47:52,370 --> 02:47:53,210
It's just gonna have an X on it.

3615
02:47:53,230 --> 02:47:58,770
and then you use the repair kit and it's gonna be back to
full what you'll see it in a chest I'm gonna give you a tin

it's going to have an axe on it.

3631
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:56,400
So it's not going to disappear from your inventory, and you
just use that repair kit, and it's going to be repaired.

3632
02:48:57,100 --> 02:48:57,700

it positive is there anything else in here a little sucker

3721
02:54:53,860 --> 02:55:00,440
lovingly I know I feel more confident going into caves in
this game because I know there's no creepers.

3722
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:02,280
Yeah, exactly.

3723
02:55:02,600 --> 02:55:02,680
Creeper.

3724
02:55:02,960 --> 02:55:07,020
And like, there is lava similar to lava stuff, but not in
the same way.

3725
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:10,080
Like, you can be pretty safe going into stuff.

3726
02:55:10,460 --> 02:55:12,420
And there's like monsters all the time.

3727
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:16,780
So I'm like, oh, it's not just me going into a cave and like
getting ambushed by monsters.

3728
02:55:16,940 --> 02:55:18,040
Like, there's monsters everywhere.

3729
02:55:18,460 --> 02:55:19,460
Yeah, you kind of like, yeah.

3730
02:55:20,420 --> 02:55:20,860
Exactly.

3731
02:55:21,400 --> 02:55:21,640
Yeah.

3732
02:55:23,100 --> 02:55:23,900
Till there are.

3733
02:55:26,480 --> 02:55:39,480
your um oh iron hatchet oh this is like a new oh nice okay
i'm throwing it in the do items despawn eventually i hope so

3734
02:55:39,480 --> 02:55:45,180
i'm not sure what we do with it i know otherwise i'm like
just throwing it into the desert another thing that's

3735
02:55:45,180 --> 02:55:52,660
freaking cool so like if you touch the stuff that's outside
of the chest area it still will like trigger the items in

3736
02:55:52,660 --> 02:55:55,960
the chest area for a certain distance What?

3737
02:55:56,220 --> 02:55:57,100
I don't know if I explained that.

3738
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:57,300
Okay.

3739
02:55:57,780 --> 02:55:59,760
So I put stuff in the chest, right?

3740
02:55:59,820 --> 02:56:05,900
And now when I'm going to craft stuff, it still pulls from
the chest, even though I don't have the items on me.

3741
02:56:06,880 --> 02:56:07,560
Oh, interesting.

3742
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:08,900
Oh, I get what you mean.

3743
02:56:08,920 --> 02:56:09,360

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3749
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:20,100

3756
02:56:51,100 --> 02:56:51,820

3757
02:56:53,460 --> 02:56:54,100

They don't hold anything.

3797
02:59:14,440 --> 02:59:15,860

03:00:35,620 --> 03:00:39,760
So if you come to the tanning rack and you take a look at
it, on the right side, it's going to be tier two

3818
03:00:39,760 --> 03:00:40,300

He's a wizard.

03:06:10,260 --> 03:06:11,680
So, you know how men become wizards?

3934
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:15,880
Oh, they're everywhere.

3935
03:06:16,100 --> 03:06:17,260
It's not a bad thing.

3936
03:06:18,020 --> 03:06:20,900
Oh, they're, like, making a lot of noise around here.

3937
03:06:21,380 --> 03:06:22,000

Uh-oh.

3945
03:06:28,360 --> 03:06:30,420
I'm not able to collect their memories.

3946
03:06:31,240 --> 03:06:32,140
Were you attacking me?

3947
03:06:32,260 --> 03:06:32,560
I'm sorry.

3948
03:06:32,860 --> 03:06:33,180
No, no, no.

3949
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:33,880
There's a guy.

3950
03:06:33,980 --> 03:06:35,440
There was a skeleton under you attacking you.

3951
03:06:35,820 --> 03:06:36,640
And I was killing him.

3952
03:06:36,880 --> 03:06:37,120
Nice.

3953
03:06:38,120 --> 03:06:38,440
Oh.

3954
03:06:38,920 --> 03:06:39,520
Oh, did I?

3955
03:06:39,860 --> 03:06:40,000
Okay.

3956
03:06:40,740 --> 03:06:43,400
No, I genuinely did not mean it as a negative in this place.

3957
03:06:43,620 --> 03:06:43,900
I know.

3958
03:06:44,040 --> 03:06:44,400
I know you did.

3959
03:06:44,440 --> 03:06:45,120
But good patch.

3960
03:06:45,340 --> 03:06:45,960
So just in case.

3961
03:06:46,100 --> 03:06:47,500
Because, you know, sometimes I've always...

3962
03:06:48,140 --> 03:06:49,880
There's copper two-handed daggers.

3963
03:06:50,020 --> 03:06:50,360
Oh, man.

3964
03:06:50,460 --> 03:06:51,380
I just made the better ones, though.

3965
03:06:51,460 --> 03:06:52,240
No, you did, yeah.

3966
03:06:52,700 --> 03:06:53,540
I made the better ones.

3967
03:06:53,700 --> 03:06:54,400
I'm going to keep you here.

3968
03:06:54,580 --> 03:06:55,120
Oh, my God.

3969
03:06:55,120 --> 03:06:56,800
It's like grandpa everywhere.

3970
03:06:57,580 --> 03:06:58,320
Oh, my gosh.

3971
03:06:58,380 --> 03:07:01,100
My dream grandpa's everywhere.

3972
03:07:03,140 --> 03:07:04,580
God, I love the sound of breaking things.

3973
03:07:05,100 --> 03:07:05,740
Copper helm.

3974
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:07,280
Oh, this is for my head.

3975
03:07:08,020 --> 03:07:09,960
Yeah, because yours is going to break soon, right?

3976
03:07:10,660 --> 03:07:11,640
It looks like it.

3977
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:11,900
Yeah.

3978
03:07:11,900 --> 03:07:13,360
Wait, it says zero out of 50.

3979
03:07:13,460 --> 03:07:14,260
Does that mean it's broken?

3980
03:07:14,900 --> 03:07:15,280
Oh, yeah.

3981
03:07:15,340 --> 03:07:15,920
It means it's broken.

3982
03:07:16,400 --> 03:07:17,340
I'll just put on the other one.

3983
03:07:18,040 --> 03:07:26,000
I look like I look really stupid with this one oh they're
all these zombies are like a little they're agra they feel a

3984
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:32,880
little stronger than the previous actually I feel like super
strong now like I'm not gonna lie I think I'm like I think

3985
03:07:32,880 --> 03:07:50,110
I'm like crazy now I mean I don't know how to tell you this
girl but you you no I'm like super strong I like I just

3986

3987
03:07:53,790 --> 03:07:55,870
My power level is like insane.

3988
03:07:56,570 --> 03:07:58,210
But Tara, I'm at spawn.

3989
03:07:59,010 --> 03:07:59,210
Like.

3990
03:08:00,010 --> 03:08:01,490
No, did you not take a bed?

3991
03:08:01,730 --> 03:08:02,150
I did.

3992
03:08:02,310 --> 03:08:03,530
I did in our little fort.

3993
03:08:04,710 --> 03:08:05,150
No.

3994
03:08:05,570 --> 03:08:07,670
I wonder because the bed is a whip.

3995
03:08:09,270 --> 03:08:09,710
No.

3996
03:08:10,650 --> 03:08:11,090
No.

3997
03:08:12,510 --> 03:08:13,510
You know what I'm going to do?

3998
03:08:13,650 --> 03:08:14,190
I'm going to die.

3999
03:08:15,210 --> 03:08:17,110
And I'll spawn back with you and we can re-adventure.

4000
03:08:17,850 --> 03:08:18,590
Are you sure?

4001
03:08:19,270 --> 03:08:19,930
Yeah, of course.

4002
03:08:20,070 --> 03:08:20,610
What if you...

4003
03:08:20,650 --> 03:08:27,390
spawn back at your bed though let me well then we're gonna
find out if you occupied your bed okay let me die i did

4004
03:08:27,390 --> 03:08:43,190
occupy okay i did oh i wonder if it's because it's the whip
area no all right let me see where i respawn oh hi baby what

4005
03:08:43,190 --> 03:08:55,110
if we explore the other way i have i agree like this way to
like get our stuff right yeah i really do think that it's

4006
03:08:55,110 --> 03:09:01,870
because we um maybe because we did it in the whip whip area
oh yeah we had no idea how would we have no wait i think i

4007
03:09:01,870 --> 03:09:09,910
see another whip area happy little accidents right right now
we can explore a whole other area sorry but that was comedy

4008
03:09:09,910 --> 03:09:21,890
gold where you're like i feel not me i feel stronger i
actually feel like i'm so Take the whip.

4009
03:09:22,090 --> 03:09:22,330
Take the whip.

4010
03:09:22,510 --> 03:09:22,730
Take the whip.

4011
03:09:25,730 --> 03:09:28,250
How dare this area betray us?

4012
03:09:28,430 --> 03:09:29,890
It was our little...

4013
03:09:29,890 --> 03:09:31,950
It was our little treasure.

4014
03:09:32,330 --> 03:09:32,790
Our little...

4015
03:09:32,790 --> 03:09:33,970
It was our cottage.

4016
03:09:34,970 --> 03:09:35,930
It was our home away from home.

4017
03:09:36,190 --> 03:09:36,970
It was our perfect.

4018
03:09:37,110 --> 03:09:38,010
It was so good.

4019
03:09:38,690 --> 03:09:40,370
It was where we do the heated rivalry.

4020
03:09:41,230 --> 03:09:41,410
Oh.

4021
03:09:41,710 --> 03:09:42,590
Have you watched that?

4022
03:09:43,250 --> 03:09:44,650
No, but it's all over my...

4023
03:09:44,650 --> 03:09:45,310
Oh my gosh, wait.

4024
03:09:45,590 --> 03:09:47,210
I actually have to send you this podcast.

4025
03:09:47,410 --> 03:09:47,550
Okay.

4026
03:09:47,610 --> 03:09:48,810
It's two guys that play hockey.

4027
03:09:48,930 --> 03:09:49,770
They're two straight guys.

4028
03:09:49,910 --> 03:09:55,390
and they're watching the show and they're talking about each
episode they're basically like going run of run of each

4029
03:09:55,390 --> 03:10:02,150
episode it's called empty netters it's so entertaining
watching these two straight men being like okay and then he

4030
03:10:02,150 --> 03:10:12,150
just you know going in i mean that's what they do have you
watched it no i haven't i i will send you that podcast just

4031
03:10:12,150 --> 03:10:16,010
like watch the first episode of it next time you're like
cooking or cleaning or doing something.

4032
03:10:16,850 --> 03:10:17,790
I'll listen, yeah.

4033
03:10:19,170 --> 03:10:21,250
I just know that it like...

4034
03:10:22,170 --> 03:10:25,730
But I don't know anything about, like, the plot.

4035
03:10:27,250 --> 03:10:28,590
I'll give you the TLDR.

4036
03:10:29,070 --> 03:10:32,390
It's kind of based on, like, Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby.

4037
03:10:32,950 --> 03:10:34,950
So it's, like, the number one and the number two prospect.

4038
03:10:35,110 --> 03:10:36,150
They're hockey men.

4039
03:10:37,150 --> 03:10:40,410
It's based on, like, the number one and the number two
prospect in hockey.

4040
03:10:41,090 --> 03:10:43,770
And basically, like, their whole thing is, like, they're
rivals, right?

4041
03:10:43,770 --> 03:10:48,850
so they're not and then they're also gay which at that time
in hockey like you know it's it's still to this day like

4042
03:10:48,850 --> 03:10:58,070
there's not a lot of openly gay players in hockey right um
because it's you know whatever whichever um i mean i think

4043
03:10:58,070 --> 03:11:04,110
gay marriage only got legalized in canada like less than 10
years ago or maybe 10 years ago maybe like 2008 or something

4044
03:11:04,110 --> 03:11:13,750
anyway i digress so then they you know spoiler alert they
kiss and do other things no no no one of them's russian oh

4045
03:11:14,790 --> 03:11:21,550
because one of them's the number one he's from russia and
the number two he's canadian damn no canada's got to step it

4046
03:11:21,550 --> 03:11:30,750
up they do they're number two number two wait this house is
like inside the ground i'm robbing it anyway i'm still gonna

4047
03:11:30,750 --> 03:11:38,570
steal i think they're dead so i think it's fine to rob yeah
you know what are we wait are we grave rob oh my god mint

4048
03:11:38,570 --> 03:11:47,090
i'm gonna have a curse just like you now yeah we're grave
robbing wait i see something over here you know yeah

4049
03:11:47,090 --> 03:11:55,050
genuinely as a friend but also a little bit content brained
you should find a curse breaker a curse break from the fun

4050
03:11:55,050 --> 03:12:00,410
of it you should find a curse break because look whether you
believe in curses or not doesn't matter but like you know

4051
03:12:00,410 --> 03:12:09,310
maybe if you oh my god he summoned the wolves no he's
summoning the wolves he's summoning the wolves oh oh he hits

4052
03:12:09,310 --> 03:12:12,210
hard oh my god the Oh my god.

4053
03:12:12,230 --> 03:12:12,890
I got you, I got you.

4054
03:12:13,270 --> 03:12:13,430
Use poison.

4055
03:12:13,530 --> 03:12:14,190
Make sure to eat food.

4056
03:12:14,310 --> 03:12:14,910
Make sure to eat food.

4057
03:12:15,110 --> 03:12:15,470
I'm trying.

4058
03:12:15,690 --> 03:12:16,330
Back up and eat food.

4059
03:12:16,470 --> 03:12:16,990
Back up and eat food.

4060
03:12:18,050 --> 03:12:18,330
Okay.

4061
03:12:18,670 --> 03:12:19,790
He summoned the wolf.

4062
03:12:19,990 --> 03:12:20,490
I saw that.

4063
03:12:20,670 --> 03:12:21,410
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4064
03:12:21,730 --> 03:12:22,330
What's killing me?

4065
03:12:22,950 --> 03:12:24,190
Oh, I think it might be the poison.

4066
03:12:24,650 --> 03:12:24,930
I bet.

4067
03:12:25,850 --> 03:12:26,270
Oh my god.

4068
03:12:26,710 --> 03:12:27,630
I'm gonna die again.

4069
03:12:28,630 --> 03:12:30,390
Every time I take a bite.

4070
03:12:30,670 --> 03:12:30,810
Okay.

4071
03:12:32,430 --> 03:12:33,510
Goodbye all my food.

4072
03:12:34,630 --> 03:12:35,730
Oh, wait, mint.

4073
03:12:36,370 --> 03:12:37,050

Oh, there's a crude battle axe, mate.

I don't want battle axe.

4082
03:12:51,930 --> 03:12:52,950
Dubey gets the way of shoes.

But yeah, you know what I mean?

4089
03:13:03,310 --> 03:13:09,050
Like, whether people believe in curses or not, you jokingly,
you know, believe that you have a curse or you do.

4090
03:13:10,410 --> 03:13:18,810

03:13:18,810 --> 03:13:24,350
let's like dial it back a little bit on the content all
right guys so today i'm hiring 10 curse makers from fiver

4092
03:13:24,350 --> 03:13:36,150
yeah maybe not like that for those who don't know i'm i'm
cursed because my mom went to the desert and touched i think

you should tell them the story yeah Well, it's pretty short.

4094
03:13:39,530 --> 03:13:41,210
My mom went to the desert and touched...

4095
03:13:41,210 --> 03:13:43,030

4114
03:15:42,810 --> 03:15:43,950
He's like not getting aggroed.

03:15:55,950 --> 03:15:57,830
No, but like that might be the strat.

03:16:02,730 --> 03:16:05,350
Wait, if we could just like keep doing that.

4127
03:16:05,610 --> 03:16:07,150

No, make it too taller.

4130
03:16:10,870 --> 03:16:12,230
We're not going to be able to jump up.

4131
03:16:13,010 --> 03:16:14,730
Oh, yeah, I wonder if he's bugged or something.

4132
03:16:15,430 --> 03:16:16,030
Ha, bugged.

4133
03:16:16,270 --> 03:16:18,350

4134
03:16:19,210 --> 03:16:19,630
You know what?

4135
03:16:19,630 --> 03:16:20,030

Okay.

4157
03:17:23,980 --> 03:17:24,320

4158
03:17:26,060 --> 03:17:26,780
I didn't know.

4159
03:17:27,340 --> 03:17:29,600
I thought you were kind of like play faking it, you know?

4160
03:17:29,700 --> 03:17:32,480
No, I think you're saying that I'm still playing dumb.

4161
03:17:32,660 --> 03:17:34,320
I think you're saying that I'm still playing dumb.

4162
03:17:35,280 --> 03:17:38,260
I just think you, sometimes you don't play, you know?

4163
03:17:39,920 --> 03:17:41,000

These guys are so scary.

4167
03:17:47,240 --> 03:17:49,400
I think these are the creepiest things in the game so far.

4168
03:17:51,180 --> 03:17:54,340
I think the creepiest thing in the game is wearing a little
maid outfit.

4169
03:17:56,540 --> 03:17:59,820
I think the creepiest thing in the game is...

4170
03:18:02,080 --> 03:18:05,900
You know you're annoying, but like the other person doesn't
even grace me with her.

4171
03:18:06,100 --> 03:18:07,000
They're like, I'm...

4172
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:08,800
I think you're the most annoying thing.

4173
03:18:08,820 --> 03:18:17,500
in the game i think it's just you i don't think i think it's
oh we're going the wrong way are we yes oh i didn't i

4182
03:19:29,240 --> 03:19:38,360

to like have somebody else attack from behind for you it's

Oh, he's still spawned.

4192
03:20:30,560 --> 03:20:34,960
I guess they may be like take a while to do spawn because we
are- Maybe because he was already spawned in.

4193
03:20:35,640 --> 03:20:36,620
Oh, no, wait.

4194
03:20:36,720 --> 03:20:37,320
Oh, no, he's still there.

4195
03:20:37,320 --> 03:20:47,200
just kidding so this is like redwood and then there's
bluewood further out he's coming on me he's coming in thank

4199
03:21:25,960 --> 03:21:35,020

4200
03:21:35,020 --> 03:21:46,040
defending his outpost outlander berserker oh get him okay
whoa he's like the most humanoid thing oh shit he hits hard

03:21:46,040 --> 03:22:01,060
okay help uh maybe oh shaman oh i'm dead i'm at spawn are
you are you far i don't know check how far it is because i

4202
03:22:01,060 --> 03:22:11,440
can run back to you it's probably not that far because we
barely i feel like we mostly side come this way come to

4203
03:22:11,440 --> 03:22:21,160
where i am on the map you will see me i don't see it i think
where did i it's not showing where i died um okay so that

4204
03:22:21,160 --> 03:22:29,040
blue wood that you see it's the it's the further one it's
the one more up top this one right more up top of it like

4205
03:22:29,040 --> 03:22:38,380
there's a this one no up top oh oh i see i see i see oh my
god okay i think if you start running it won't be too too

4206
03:22:38,380 --> 03:22:46,380
far running running but let's maybe okay i see a bed i'm
gonna steal again and then we're gonna steal another bed

4207
03:22:46,380 --> 03:22:52,480
from the orcs we can do like a temporary base at the orc
camp let's get into the habit of doing it i'm so not used to

4208
03:22:52,480 --> 03:23:01,440
having the compass up top so i just don't look at it my
brain is still in minecraft mode but like i'm not used to

4209
03:23:01,440 --> 03:23:08,680
following directions nope said min that's what she said
that's exactly what i said that's exactly what i said and I

4210
03:23:08,680 --> 03:23:17,860
was saying that sounds my yep except for standing is like
people sitting typically because she's very short that's not

4211
03:23:17,860 --> 03:23:32,440
even this is not how height works no my god wait I'm going
the wrong wait we just looted here I'm gonna see if there's

4212
03:23:32,440 --> 03:23:39,540
a bed I have one I just you know because we picked it up
yeah we should we should always keep a bed like on a so we

4213
03:23:39,540 --> 03:23:49,700
can see but yeah i wish you could have more spawn points
like i wish we could be like mint bed one i know right but i

4214
03:23:49,700 --> 03:23:59,340
guess that's too easy too easy too easy what is that oh it's
a mushroom all right there's no beds here how did these orcs

4215
03:23:59,340 --> 03:24:08,540
live they're savage i think i literally saw him laying on
the ground yeah okay okay i hear the judgment in your voice

4216
03:24:08,540 --> 03:24:10,900
by the way I can hear it.

4217
03:24:11,340 --> 03:24:12,920
This is true bachelor living.

4218
03:24:14,400 --> 03:24:16,180
Just a mattress on the ground.

4219
03:24:18,840 --> 03:24:19,340
Oh, I see you.

4220
03:24:19,460 --> 03:24:19,700
You're close.

4221
03:24:19,920 --> 03:24:21,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm not so far.

4222
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:24,860
But I'm afraid of the berserker.

4223
03:24:25,680 --> 03:24:28,820
Oh, how, how, how, how.

4224
03:24:28,920 --> 03:24:30,600
Is that the music you're hearing?

4225
03:24:31,300 --> 03:24:31,640
Okay.

4226
03:24:32,380 --> 03:24:33,600

03:27:03,900 --> 03:27:06,680

03:33:57,100 --> 03:33:57,160
Ice.

4393
03:33:57,180 --> 03:33:58,780
I want to see if it does something funny.

4394
03:33:59,360 --> 03:34:02,200
Or like if it's going to, you know like in Minecraft, when
you break ice, it's like ding, ding.

4395
03:34:02,560 --> 03:34:02,820
Yeah.

4396
03:34:03,660 --> 03:34:04,180
Aw.

4397
03:34:04,500 --> 03:34:05,020
No?

4398
03:34:05,280 --> 03:34:05,880
No sound?

4399
03:34:06,680 --> 03:34:08,480
Oh, it's actually kind of ASMR.

4400
03:34:09,940 --> 03:34:11,700
Yeah, that's kind of nice.

4401
03:34:11,700 --> 03:34:12,760
Oh, it's mint!

4402
03:34:13,220 --> 03:34:13,440
What?

4403
03:34:13,720 --> 03:34:14,260
The music!

4404
03:34:16,970 --> 03:34:18,280
I don't hear anything.

4405
03:34:19,040 --> 03:34:20,000
Wait till it starts.

4406
03:34:20,800 --> 03:34:21,780
Also, you're like sliding.

4407
03:34:22,100 --> 03:34:22,720
I know, so are you.

4408
03:34:24,060 --> 03:34:25,360
Listen to the music.

4409
03:34:25,860 --> 03:34:27,000
It's so good.

4410
03:34:27,740 --> 03:34:28,940
It's going to start for you in a moment.

4411
03:34:29,760 --> 03:34:30,480
It's mysterious.

4412
03:34:30,780 --> 03:34:31,380
You hear it?

4413
03:34:32,440 --> 03:34:33,620
It's so good.

4414
03:34:37,080 --> 03:34:39,100
It's like Harry Potter-esque a little bit.

4415
03:34:39,340 --> 03:34:47,340
yeah yeah but also like the nutcracker aspect yeah yeah so
let's fight this bear oh okay

4416
03:34:53,800 --> 03:35:04,660
i think i think i took way more damage from you than i did
but i didn't even strike yes you did okay i strike one time

4417
03:35:04,660 --> 03:35:11,900
i hit once are we running the right way i hit we're going
north we're going north Okay, see, this is why I'm glad I

4418
03:35:11,900 --> 03:35:12,860
taught you how to read the map.

4419
03:35:13,120 --> 03:35:13,740
Yeah, now I know.

4420
03:35:13,980 --> 03:35:14,340
Now I know.

4421
03:35:14,840 --> 03:35:15,720
Whoa, another thing.

4422
03:35:15,840 --> 03:35:16,280
Oh, bear.

4423
03:35:17,500 --> 03:35:18,780
Bear and another cottage core.

4424
03:35:18,980 --> 03:35:20,220
So we got to be careful that.

4425
03:35:21,420 --> 03:35:21,720
Oh, okay.

4426
03:35:21,980 --> 03:35:22,860
He's aggroed on you.

4427
03:35:22,940 --> 03:35:23,720
He's aggroed on me.

4428
03:35:24,060 --> 03:35:24,740
Kill him.

4429
03:35:26,220 --> 03:35:27,520
He's aggroed on me.

4430
03:35:27,840 --> 03:35:28,320
Kill him.

4431
03:35:28,380 --> 03:35:29,400
Why are you killing him so slow?

4432
03:35:29,820 --> 03:35:30,500
Okay, thank you.

4433
03:35:31,300 --> 03:35:32,620
I'm doing my bear as well.

4434
03:35:33,200 --> 03:35:34,360
I don't have two daggers.

4435
03:35:34,460 --> 03:35:34,900
I got one.

4436
03:35:35,820 --> 03:35:37,680
It should do as much damage.

4437
03:35:39,540 --> 03:35:41,580
Whoa, it's like an ice wall.

4438
03:35:42,320 --> 03:35:42,920
What is this?

4439
03:35:44,360 --> 03:35:45,640
The titans, the giants.

4440
03:35:45,940 --> 03:35:46,640
Oh my god.

4441
03:35:47,480 --> 03:35:49,740
Humanity received a grave reminder.

4442
03:35:52,640 --> 03:35:53,940
I'm digging up.

4443
03:35:54,120 --> 03:35:54,820
I'm digging up.

4444
03:35:57,180 --> 03:35:58,980
We're in the boreal reach.

4445
03:36:07,600 --> 03:36:08,000
Whoa.

4446
03:36:08,060 --> 03:36:10,020
One woman's trance is another woman's trance.

4447
03:36:10,380 --> 03:36:11,080
Hello, little owl.

4448
03:36:13,320 --> 03:36:13,880
Who are you?

4449
03:36:13,940 --> 03:36:15,320
You didn't even rob these people.

4450
03:36:16,080 --> 03:36:16,820
You changed.

4451
03:36:17,020 --> 03:36:19,060
I am in a blizzard right now.

4452
03:36:19,080 --> 03:36:20,100
You don't understand.

4453
03:36:21,040 --> 03:36:23,080
I like it's a literal blizzard.

4454
03:36:23,960 --> 03:36:27,920
It says you can ride like a three six.

4455
03:36:28,440 --> 03:36:28,860
I don't know.

4456
03:36:28,940 --> 03:36:30,760
I wonder if I can like it.

4457
03:36:30,780 --> 03:36:31,520
What's the word?

4458
03:36:32,500 --> 03:36:33,300
Like cold.

4459
03:36:35,100 --> 03:36:35,580
Ah, brr.

4460
03:36:35,800 --> 03:36:38,180
Ah, it's quite chilly.

4461
03:36:38,380 --> 03:36:40,960
I made it a ladder, but you know, whatever.

4462
03:36:42,340 --> 03:36:43,040
Oh, you did.

4463
03:36:43,200 --> 03:36:43,480
Sorry.

4464
03:36:43,500 --> 03:36:43,860
Yeah.

4465
03:36:43,940 --> 03:36:45,240
How do you think I got up here?

4466
03:36:46,260 --> 03:36:46,940
Uh, magic?

4467
03:36:47,240 --> 03:36:48,800
Wait, the blizzard stop.

4468
03:36:49,080 --> 03:36:50,640
Of course, as soon as you're here.

4469
03:36:52,840 --> 03:36:53,320
Wee!

4470
03:36:53,720 --> 03:36:54,180
Wee!

4471
03:36:55,820 --> 03:36:57,800
Oh, you can hear the wind noises.

4472
03:36:58,040 --> 03:36:59,540
Wait, I see something over here.

4473
03:37:00,180 --> 03:37:00,760
Where, where, where?

4474
03:37:00,820 --> 03:37:02,100
I think it's a polar bear.

4475
03:37:02,820 --> 03:37:03,880
Wait, there's also...

4476
03:37:03,880 --> 03:37:05,540
There's, like, wolves and stuff.

4477
03:37:05,640 --> 03:37:06,580
There's special animals.

4478
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:08,000
Yeah.

4479
03:37:08,440 --> 03:37:09,880
Oh, yeah, it's an Arctic wolf.

4480
03:37:11,220 --> 03:37:12,520
It's gonna attack us.

4481
03:37:13,520 --> 03:37:15,220
No, I think that's a saber game.

4482
03:37:15,340 --> 03:37:16,580
Look at his big teeth.

4483
03:37:16,740 --> 03:37:17,420
It's a snow leopard.

4484
03:37:18,100 --> 03:37:18,500
Leopard.

4485
03:37:19,080 --> 03:37:19,760
Oh, sorry.

4486
03:37:20,040 --> 03:37:20,120
Oh, sorry.

4487
03:37:20,320 --> 03:37:20,520
I did.

4488
03:37:20,740 --> 03:37:21,240
Yeah.

4489
03:37:21,680 --> 03:37:22,200
My bad.

4490
03:37:23,940 --> 03:37:24,880
Because we're icy.

4491
03:37:25,120 --> 03:37:25,380
We're slicing.

4492
03:37:25,600 --> 03:37:25,960
We're sliding.

4493
03:37:26,900 --> 03:37:27,820
Oh, it's a little funky.

4494
03:37:28,060 --> 03:37:28,180
Yeah.

4495
03:37:28,800 --> 03:37:29,100
Ooh.

4496
03:37:30,720 --> 03:37:32,480
The music is so, like, whimsical.

4497
03:37:33,480 --> 03:37:34,540
And we're, like, slicing.

4498
03:37:34,800 --> 03:37:35,100
Yeah.

4499
03:37:35,360 --> 03:37:35,840
Oh, my God.

4500
03:37:35,920 --> 03:37:36,400
He's creepy.

4501
03:37:37,240 --> 03:37:37,980
Oh, he's on you.

4502
03:37:38,080 --> 03:37:38,480
He's on you.

4503
03:37:41,620 --> 03:37:45,500
Sometimes it won't let you, like, uh...

4504
03:37:45,500 --> 03:37:45,960
Walk?

4505
03:37:46,400 --> 03:37:46,800
Yeah.

4506
03:37:46,980 --> 03:37:48,560
It's not because I'm low stamina either.

4507
03:37:48,560 --> 03:37:50,760
Like, I'm pressing it even when my stamina is high.

4508
03:37:51,520 --> 03:37:53,160
You knew what I was going to say.

4509
03:37:53,780 --> 03:37:54,060
I did.

4510
03:37:54,100 --> 03:37:55,620
You preemptively answered me.

4511
03:37:56,020 --> 03:37:56,960
You said block.

4512
03:37:57,100 --> 03:37:57,900
That's what I was thinking.

4513
03:37:59,380 --> 03:38:00,260
Where are we?

4514
03:38:00,360 --> 03:38:02,640
We're just on this ice, icy area.

4515
03:38:03,020 --> 03:38:03,520
Where are we?

4516
03:38:04,660 --> 03:38:06,720
And it's so icy.

4517
03:38:08,120 --> 03:38:09,740
Come out, sleep, buddy.

4518
03:38:09,800 --> 03:38:10,260
Oh, careful.

4519
03:38:10,700 --> 03:38:11,160
Yeah.

4520
03:38:12,800 --> 03:38:14,820
What is that up there?

4521
03:38:15,220 --> 03:38:17,200
That's another biome we haven't been in yet.

4522
03:38:17,440 --> 03:38:17,920
Let's go.

4523
03:38:18,580 --> 03:38:19,440
Let's go.

4524
03:38:19,620 --> 03:38:20,020
Let's go.

4525
03:38:20,520 --> 03:38:20,980
Let's go.

4526
03:38:21,380 --> 03:38:22,200
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

4527
03:38:22,320 --> 03:38:23,340
Oh, oh, oh geez.

4528
03:38:23,680 --> 03:38:24,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4529
03:38:24,400 --> 03:38:25,180
I'm, are you here?

4530
03:38:25,380 --> 03:38:28,280
Come, come on my slot and then I'm just gonna take out.

4531
03:38:32,680 --> 03:38:33,560
All right.

4532
03:38:33,840 --> 03:38:34,820
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4533
03:38:34,840 --> 03:38:35,000
Mint?

4534
03:38:35,280 --> 03:38:36,320
Where'd you go?

4535
03:38:36,960 --> 03:38:39,020
Oh my god, my world like...

4536
03:38:39,020 --> 03:38:41,520
Did you just clip out of the world the way you were?

4537
03:38:43,160 --> 03:38:43,600
Mint?

4538
03:38:43,960 --> 03:38:47,200
I like crack the game for a second.

4539
03:38:48,900 --> 03:38:52,520
Okay, for some reason I am on the other edge of the cliff.

4540
03:38:53,140 --> 03:38:54,040
Look at your map.

4541
03:38:54,400 --> 03:38:55,300
Oh, I see you!

4542
03:38:55,600 --> 03:38:56,560
I see you!

4543
03:38:57,580 --> 03:39:00,630
Okay, so it was like a weird glitch of sorts or like...

4544
03:39:01,340 --> 03:39:02,760
It was so weird.

4545
03:39:04,240 --> 03:39:05,640
It like glitched.

4546
03:39:06,700 --> 03:39:07,760
You want me to...

4547
03:39:07,760 --> 03:39:12,260
Well, we were going to explore over here, so I guess I'll
just wait over here.

4548
03:39:14,100 --> 03:39:15,440
Wait, let me see where I'm going.

4549
03:39:15,500 --> 03:39:16,980
Am I the blue or by the way?

4550
03:39:17,680 --> 03:39:18,400
Oh, I'm the blue.

4551
03:39:18,560 --> 03:39:20,080
Okay, you're your own blue.

4552
03:39:20,460 --> 03:39:21,240
You're your own blue.

4553
03:39:21,400 --> 03:39:21,480
Okay, wait.

4554
03:39:21,600 --> 03:39:23,960
I'm going to go back up and just come to you, okay?

4555
03:39:24,180 --> 03:39:24,420
Okay.

4556
03:39:24,560 --> 03:39:26,420
I think it's going to be easier than, like, running around.

4557
03:39:26,680 --> 03:39:26,920
Okay.

4558
03:39:27,780 --> 03:39:28,620
That was crazy.

4559
03:39:28,720 --> 03:39:30,760
That was really funny to watch.

4560
03:39:31,560 --> 03:39:33,360
What happened to you when that happened?

4561
03:39:33,500 --> 03:39:36,780
It just, you just popped that out of existence, like,
nothing.

4562
03:39:40,080 --> 03:39:41,540
Okay, let me come to you.

4563
03:39:41,880 --> 03:39:43,920
It literally, like, was glistening.

4564
03:39:44,160 --> 03:39:44,820
It was so...

4565
03:39:44,820 --> 03:39:45,060
Oh!

4566
03:39:46,060 --> 03:39:46,840
Sorry, once again.

4567
03:39:47,900 --> 03:39:48,540

I feel like we've seen a great amount of it, but you're
right.

4656
03:43:22,890 --> 03:43:23,850
We haven't gone to the right.

Why did your- wait, you- that means you pressed F and you
killed your horse.

There was a little copper.

03:47:43,290 --> 03:47:43,690
You'll see me.

4717
03:47:43,970 --> 03:47:45,730

4721
03:47:53,750 --> 03:47:55,190
Aw, so sad.

4722
03:47:55,470 --> 03:47:57,030
Wait, my horse can't jump up.

4723
03:47:58,170 --> 03:47:59,070
You can't jump up there?

4724
03:47:59,150 --> 03:48:00,690
Yeah, oh, let me mine the block up.

4725

I require a grand entrance.

4728
03:48:06,910 --> 03:48:07,830
You don't jump up that block?

4729
03:48:07,970 --> 03:48:08,230

03:48:18,590 --> 03:48:18,770
Hold on.

4737
03:48:18,870 --> 03:48:19,010
Let me...

4738
03:48:19,010 --> 03:48:19,790
I can't see anything.

4739
03:48:19,890 --> 03:48:20,610
Why is it so dark?

4740
03:48:21,390 --> 03:48:21,950
Oh, there we go.

4741
03:48:23,830 --> 03:48:25,690
Alright, I'm going to make you a slow staircase.

4742
03:48:26,270 --> 03:48:26,350
Okay.

4743
03:48:26,450 --> 03:48:27,690
Yeah, jump up here.

4744
03:48:28,670 --> 03:48:30,490
And then here and up here and to the...

4745
03:48:30,490 --> 03:48:30,810
Oh, okay.

4746
03:48:30,910 --> 03:48:31,050
Careful.

4747
03:48:31,210 --> 03:48:31,990
Oh, okay.

4748
03:48:32,110 --> 03:48:32,650
Yeah, yeah, I know.

4749
03:48:32,950 --> 03:48:34,950
I'm going to try to not jump next to the water.

4750
03:48:35,050 --> 03:48:35,290
Don't worry.

4751
03:48:35,470 --> 03:48:35,630
Okay.

4752
03:48:35,750 --> 03:48:37,030
I'm going to dig a...

4753
03:48:37,030 --> 03:48:37,690
Okay, up here.

4754
03:48:37,790 --> 03:48:39,070
Why is the sky red?

4755
03:48:40,170 --> 03:48:41,050
Don't worry about it.

4756
03:48:44,390 --> 03:48:45,070
We'll be fine.

4757
03:48:45,150 --> 03:48:45,390
We'll be fine.

4758
03:48:47,810 --> 03:48:50,290
Do you need an extra block of height for the horse or you're
fine?

4759
03:48:50,790 --> 03:48:51,510
I might.

4760
03:48:51,730 --> 03:48:53,350
I can't get up on...

4761
03:48:53,350 --> 03:48:54,050
You can get up on that.

4762
03:48:54,750 --> 03:48:55,090
Oh, here.

4763
03:48:55,950 --> 03:48:56,750

03:48:59,430 --> 03:48:59,790
Okay, there we go.

4772
03:49:03,330 --> 03:49:04,330
Actually, I'm stuck again.

4773

You're too tall.

4779
03:49:17,690 --> 03:49:18,190
You're too sexy.

Nope.

4807
03:50:30,170 --> 03:50:30,550
We're good.

4808
03:50:31,030 --> 03:50:31,430
Whoa.

4809
03:50:33,310 --> 03:50:33,490

4810
03:50:34,990 --> 03:50:35,690

4812
03:50:36,830 --> 03:50:37,330

4813
03:50:37,950 --> 03:50:38,750

There's a big guy.

4817
03:50:42,390 --> 03:50:42,410
Okay.

4818
03:50:42,510 --> 03:50:43,150
I see him.

4819
03:50:43,230 --> 03:50:44,290
You're definitely going to die here.

4820
03:50:44,550 --> 03:50:47,910
I think if we run past them, we could, like, go to the other
side.

4821
03:50:49,270 --> 03:50:50,330
There's water down there.

4822
03:50:50,430 --> 03:50:50,670
Don't.

4823
03:50:50,970 --> 03:50:52,350
Oh, there's guys down there, too.

4824
03:50:52,750 --> 03:50:54,070
Okay, I'm getting off my horse.

4825
03:50:54,790 --> 03:50:56,250
I'm going to get off my high horse.

4826
03:50:57,510 --> 03:50:58,210
Put your bed here.

4827
03:50:58,290 --> 03:50:58,850
How do I...

4828
03:50:58,850 --> 03:51:00,250
Actually, how do I get off of him?

4829
03:51:00,510 --> 03:51:00,970
Press F.

4830
03:51:02,490 --> 03:51:02,690
Okay.

4831
03:51:02,850 --> 03:51:03,490

03:51:04,230 --> 03:51:04,590
Okay.

4833
03:51:19,610 --> 03:51:25,990
No, he aggroed on me.

4834
03:51:26,270 --> 03:51:27,510
Hold on, I'm going to put my bed down here.

4835
03:51:28,430 --> 03:51:29,110
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4836
03:51:29,750 --> 03:51:32,990
I can jump down to you.

4837
03:51:34,590 --> 03:51:35,890
That is so funny.

4838
03:51:36,190 --> 03:51:36,610
I can't.

4839
03:51:37,090 --> 03:51:38,350
I can't believe that.

4840
03:51:38,430 --> 03:51:39,270
I have to pee.

4841
03:51:39,450 --> 03:51:40,170
I have to pee.

4842
03:51:40,270 --> 03:51:41,610
I'm going to piss myself.

4843
03:51:43,090 --> 03:51:44,890
Oh my god, laughing like that.

4844
03:51:45,030 --> 03:51:45,770
I'm like, okay, I got to be...

4845
03:51:45,770 --> 03:51:46,250
Hold on one second.

4846
03:51:46,370 --> 03:51:47,810
I'm going to like wall myself in.

4847
03:51:47,830 --> 03:51:48,350
Okay, okay.

4848
03:51:48,870 --> 03:51:52,050
I think if you go back to the water and swim back around to
where I am.

4849
03:51:52,290 --> 03:51:52,470
Okay.

4850
03:51:52,590 --> 03:51:52,830
Oh my god.

4851
03:51:53,010 --> 03:51:55,070
Okay, this guy is beautiful.

4852
03:51:56,210 --> 03:51:58,770
I'm making some food real quick and then I'm going to...

4853
03:51:58,770 --> 03:52:00,110
I'll swim over there.

4854
03:52:00,410 --> 03:52:01,470
Give me one second.

4855
03:52:01,650 --> 03:52:03,530
I got to pee because if that happens again...

4856
03:52:05,190 --> 03:52:06,970
That was so fun.

4857
03:52:07,250 --> 03:52:08,210
How did that happen?

4858
03:52:09,510 --> 03:52:10,310
The water.

03:52:12,590 --> 03:52:12,810

04:07:58,940 --> 04:08:03,700
The only thing here, too, with the enemies is like, we got
to be careful not to go too far back or too far forward.

5066
04:08:03,820 --> 04:08:04,140
Yeah.

5067
04:08:04,260 --> 04:08:05,480
Because there's holes everywhere.

5068
04:08:05,560 --> 04:08:06,140
Yeah, exactly.

5069
04:08:06,440 --> 04:08:07,380
Oh, you made torches.

5070
04:08:07,980 --> 04:08:08,400
Look at you.

5071
04:08:08,600 --> 04:08:09,140
Yeah, we can make...

5072
04:08:09,140 --> 04:08:10,180
I don't have too, too many.

5073
04:08:10,200 --> 04:08:10,880
I can make a few more.

5074
04:08:12,240 --> 04:08:18,260
so we can make more torches yeah yeah yeah what do you need
for torches sap fiber you can check in your inventory sap

oh Oh, wait.

5078
04:08:52,000 --> 04:08:54,640
If we get out of the fire, see, it gets, like, lighter over
there.

5079
04:08:54,700 --> 04:08:56,100
Yeah, what is this over here?

5080
04:08:56,520 --> 04:08:56,960
Ooh.

5081
04:08:59,380 --> 04:09:01,300
Oh, this must be an endgame ore.

5082
04:09:01,620 --> 04:09:02,600
Yeah, probably.

5083
04:09:04,420 --> 04:09:05,280
It's a cobble.

5084
04:09:05,440 --> 04:09:06,960
Oh, yeah, that stuff was like...

5085
04:09:07,780 --> 04:09:08,400

Oh, hell.

5090
04:09:16,420 --> 04:09:16,540
Oh, hell.

5091
04:09:16,540 --> 04:09:17,380
There's another dog.

5092
04:09:18,260 --> 04:09:19,100
Another dog?

5093
04:09:19,500 --> 04:09:19,700
Ow.

5094
04:09:19,960 --> 04:09:21,000
It's three dogs.

5095
04:09:21,460 --> 04:09:21,900
Ow.

5096
04:09:22,680 --> 04:09:23,440
I think he's on me.

5097
04:09:23,620 --> 04:09:24,120
He's on me.

5098
04:09:24,800 --> 04:09:24,940
Oh, wait.

5099
04:09:25,080 --> 04:09:25,440
He's on me.

5100
04:09:25,720 --> 04:09:26,540
Unless there's another dog.

5101
04:09:26,760 --> 04:09:27,540
Oh, I guess so.

5102
04:09:28,040 --> 04:09:29,140
I dropped him in the lava.

5103
04:09:29,320 --> 04:09:29,580
Where are you?

5104
04:09:29,740 --> 04:09:30,040
Oh, yeah.

5105
04:09:30,180 --> 04:09:30,380
Sorry.

5106
04:09:30,540 --> 04:09:31,160
I read the other way.

5107
04:09:31,840 --> 04:09:33,020
I dropped the dog in the lava.

5108
04:09:33,320 --> 04:09:33,720
Oh, nice.

5109
04:09:40,350 --> 04:09:41,190
Yeah, kill him.

5110
04:09:41,210 --> 04:09:41,710
Oh, no.

5111
04:09:41,970 --> 04:09:42,170
Nine.

5112
04:09:42,570 --> 04:09:42,990
Oh, sorry.

5113
04:09:43,350 --> 04:09:43,850
Do you need coconut?

5114
04:09:44,210 --> 04:09:45,110
Look at these guys.

5115
04:09:45,190 --> 04:09:45,770
There's yaks.

5116
04:09:46,870 --> 04:09:47,710
Oh, wait.

5117
04:09:47,810 --> 04:09:48,050
I also...

5118
04:09:48,050 --> 04:09:49,390
I need to cook my meat, actually.

5119
04:09:49,770 --> 04:09:50,230
Oh, yeah.

5120
04:09:50,330 --> 04:09:51,070
I should eat mine too.

5121
04:09:51,070 --> 04:09:51,390
I need a minute.

5122
04:09:52,770 --> 04:09:54,430
I have a lot of meat to cook.

5123
04:09:54,730 --> 04:09:55,590
I have five.

5124
04:09:55,770 --> 04:09:56,130
Oh.

5125
04:09:56,450 --> 04:09:58,410
There's also some stuff in front of us, too.

5126
04:09:58,550 --> 04:09:59,830
There's, like, a little guy in front of us.

5127
04:09:59,870 --> 04:10:00,310
Do you see it?

5128
04:10:00,310 --> 04:10:01,050
Like, the little...

5129
04:10:01,050 --> 04:10:03,210
Oh, yeah, there's a little frog-looking guy.

5130
04:10:03,210 --> 04:10:04,250
And there's a little blue guy jumping.

5131
04:10:04,470 --> 04:10:05,430
Yeah, what the heck?

5132
04:10:08,710 --> 04:10:09,810
Oh, this is so exciting.

5133
04:10:09,950 --> 04:10:10,390
I'm going to go...

5134
04:10:10,390 --> 04:10:10,990
Oh, and I have 15 arrows.

5135
04:10:11,090 --> 04:10:11,970
Here, I'm going to drop them for you.

5136
04:10:12,070 --> 04:10:12,270
Okay.

5137
04:10:13,050 --> 04:10:13,650
I'm going to go...

5138
04:10:13,650 --> 04:10:14,930
The music is so cool.

5139
04:10:15,610 --> 04:10:15,950
I know.

5140
04:10:16,150 --> 04:10:16,610
Wait for me.

5141
04:10:16,610 --> 04:10:18,510
Don't fight the guy because I'm still cooking my music.

5142
04:10:18,510 --> 04:10:19,310
I'm not going to fight him.

5143
04:10:19,330 --> 04:10:20,510
I want to go see the yak.

5144
04:10:21,490 --> 04:10:21,810
Okay.

5145
04:10:22,590 --> 04:10:23,230
Little yak.

5146
04:10:23,370 --> 04:10:23,570
Okay.

5147
04:10:23,770 --> 04:10:24,970
I think it was also dark.

5148
04:10:25,070 --> 04:10:26,230
I can't think of it as dark as it was.

5149
04:10:26,350 --> 04:10:27,050
We were.

5150
04:10:27,410 --> 04:10:28,270
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

5151
04:10:28,310 --> 04:10:28,810
I'm coming, I'm coming.

5152
04:10:33,040 --> 04:10:34,060
I thought you were friends!

5153
04:10:34,280 --> 04:10:36,060
Oh my god- I think he's a zombie cow.

5154
04:10:36,240 --> 04:10:37,020
I think he's a zombie!

5155
04:10:38,200 --> 04:10:39,220
Oh my god.

5156
04:10:39,420 --> 04:10:39,620
Oh my god.

5157
04:10:39,620 --> 04:10:40,520
No, I thought you were a friend!

5158
04:10:41,380 --> 04:10:42,240
You're a yak!

5159
04:10:42,960 --> 04:10:44,200
He betrayed me!

5160
04:10:45,320 --> 04:10:47,560
I think everything in this area is gonna attack us.

5161
04:10:47,560 --> 04:10:48,800
I think so probably, oh.

5162
04:10:49,020 --> 04:10:49,500
Look at the frog.

5163
04:10:50,240 --> 04:10:51,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look at him.

5164
04:10:52,360 --> 04:10:52,760
Okay.

5165
04:10:53,160 --> 04:10:57,620
Let's make a pack that every time we see a hole in the
ground, like we jump over them because it's usually not

5166
04:10:57,620 --> 04:10:58,480
regular ground.

5167
04:10:58,480 --> 04:10:58,800
It's not.

5168
04:10:59,520 --> 04:11:00,460
Regular ground, yeah.

5169
04:11:01,600 --> 04:11:02,060
Holy cow.

5170
04:11:02,560 --> 04:11:04,480
I brought my shield.

5171
04:11:05,000 --> 04:11:06,300
Oh, he like brought me close.

5172
04:11:06,680 --> 04:11:08,000
Oh, the guy is staring at us.

5173
04:11:08,080 --> 04:11:08,320
Uh-oh.

5174
04:11:08,580 --> 04:11:09,400
Oh, it's fine.

5175
04:11:11,920 --> 04:11:12,860
Oh, he's blocking.

5176
04:11:13,000 --> 04:11:14,340
He's blocking my dude.

5177
04:11:14,900 --> 04:11:15,420
Oh, dang it.

5178
04:11:15,460 --> 04:11:16,000

What the hell?

5198
04:12:16,140 --> 04:12:16,720
Demon horse?

04:12:19,400 --> 04:12:19,740
I wonder.

5202
04:12:20,120 --> 04:12:20,940
Try, try, try, try, try.

He runs away, so I don't think he's, you know.

Yeah, yeah.

5205

I'm also scared.

5206
04:12:25,760 --> 04:12:28,280
We're going to, like, die to our death running after him.

5207
04:12:29,260 --> 04:12:29,940
Go to the slug.

5208
04:12:30,060 --> 04:12:30,860
I'm going to the slug.

5209
04:12:31,280 --> 04:12:31,800
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Okay, let's go.

5214
04:12:34,240 --> 04:12:35,320
This guy can't be that bad.

5215
04:12:36,460 --> 04:12:37,500
Let me aggro him first.

5216
04:12:39,100 --> 04:12:40,760
Wait, I don't think he's hurting at all.

5217
04:12:41,360 --> 04:12:42,120
Oh, yes, he is.

5218
04:12:42,360 --> 04:12:42,420
I'm sorry.

5219
04:12:42,520 --> 04:12:42,640
Yes, he is.

5220
04:12:42,880 --> 04:12:43,800
Wait, no, that's you.

5221
04:12:44,800 --> 04:12:45,120
Stop!

5222
04:12:45,300 --> 04:12:45,620
Don't hurt him!

5223
04:12:45,620 --> 04:12:46,300
No, he's hurting you.

5224
04:12:46,460 --> 04:12:47,720
No, that was actually you hurting him.

5225
04:12:48,060 --> 04:12:48,440
Okay, sorry.

5226
04:12:48,460 --> 04:12:49,720
That was not me hurting him.

5227
04:12:50,420 --> 04:12:52,080
Oh, my god, he looked so silly.

5228
04:12:52,640 --> 04:12:54,360
Here, grab my essence of fire.

5229
04:12:55,560 --> 04:12:55,800
Oh.

5230
04:12:55,820 --> 04:12:56,720
Actually, no, I have enough room.

5231
04:12:56,840 --> 04:12:57,060
We're fine.

5232
04:12:57,100 --> 04:12:57,500
Okay, okay.

5233
04:12:59,300 --> 04:13:01,760
Wow, what a spooky place.

5234
04:13:01,940 --> 04:13:02,560
Oh, another skele.

5235
04:13:03,340 --> 04:13:03,840
Skele.

5236
04:13:04,520 --> 04:13:05,020
Skele.

5237
04:13:05,700 --> 04:13:05,800
Skele.

5238
04:13:11,560 --> 04:13:12,120
Oh, my God.

5239
04:13:12,280 --> 04:13:12,600
Nice.

5240
04:13:12,960 --> 04:13:13,940
Okay, we're killing it.

5241
04:13:14,080 --> 04:13:14,840
Literally, figuratively.

5242
04:13:15,580 --> 04:13:16,720
Is that a little guy with a gun?

5243
04:13:17,020 --> 04:13:17,820
Oh, my God.

5244
04:13:17,860 --> 04:13:18,760

04:21:44,260 --> 04:21:47,200
They're going to add it that apparently you can, like, make
your armor not visible.

5412
04:21:47,660 --> 04:21:48,120
Oh, good.

5413
04:21:48,120 --> 04:21:48,600
I'm not going to lie.

5414
04:21:48,660 --> 04:21:50,300
This is a look with the gloves.

5415
04:21:51,260 --> 04:21:51,960
That is a look.

5416
04:21:52,640 --> 04:21:52,960
Mine?

5417
04:21:53,080 --> 04:21:53,280
Oh, yeah.

5418
04:21:53,300 --> 04:21:54,240
Yeah, yeah, I kind of love it.

5419
04:21:54,300 --> 04:21:54,880
I'm kind of obsessed.

5420
04:21:57,040 --> 04:21:59,420
Wait, I want to see what this thing is real quick.

5421
04:22:00,200 --> 04:22:02,480
It's probably going to attack me, but that's okay.

5422
04:22:02,600 --> 04:22:04,260
Oh, yeah, that's the flaming skull I was talking about.

5423
04:22:04,400 --> 04:22:06,000
They have, like, a question mark when they see you.

5424
04:22:06,060 --> 04:22:06,660
Exclamation mark.

5425
04:22:06,720 --> 04:22:08,260
Oh, that's so funny.

5426
04:22:08,500 --> 04:22:09,480
I think it's because he's about to shoot a fire.

5427
04:22:09,480 --> 04:22:13,880
Oh, my God, this looks exactly like a guy in Doom.

5428
04:22:15,140 --> 04:22:15,360
Yeah.

5429
04:22:19,720 --> 04:22:20,440
Oh, nice.

5430
04:22:20,600 --> 04:22:21,320
Yeah, good job.

5431
04:22:21,640 --> 04:22:22,540
Yeah, ow, ow.

5432
04:22:22,900 --> 04:22:24,860

5436
04:22:55,780 --> 04:22:57,340
It doesn't kill you right away.

5437
04:22:57,420 --> 04:22:58,000
It kills you slowly.

5438
04:22:58,240 --> 04:22:58,900
Killing you softly.

5439
04:22:59,560 --> 04:23:01,260
You're killing me softly.

5440
04:23:01,640 --> 04:23:02,860
We love him.

5441
04:23:03,240 --> 04:23:04,140
That's cool to know.

5442
04:23:04,800 --> 04:23:06,220
I wonder if it's because I was off.

5443
04:23:06,440 --> 04:23:06,800
Oh.

5444
04:23:07,260 --> 04:23:07,600
It's fine.

5445
04:23:07,700 --> 04:23:08,120
He can have him.

5446
04:23:08,300 --> 04:23:09,100
Oh, you can have him.

5447
04:23:09,100 --> 04:23:09,440
He actually matches.

5448
04:23:10,040 --> 04:23:10,900
He matches you.

5449
04:23:11,480 --> 04:23:11,900

04:28:24,820 --> 04:28:26,100
This game is so fun.

5521
04:28:26,120 --> 04:28:28,100
Oh my gosh.

5522
04:28:29,900 --> 04:28:31,800
This game was so fun.

5523
04:28:32,160 --> 04:28:33,200
I hope you guys had fun.

5524
04:28:33,760 --> 04:28:37,440
I hope you guys enjoyed our grand tour.

5525
04:28:38,240 --> 04:28:40,980
Finishing off on that last island was kind of crazy.

5526
04:28:43,880 --> 04:28:45,000
Also, I...

5527
04:28:45,000 --> 04:28:49,500
So I had issues with the game when I first...

5528
04:28:49,500 --> 04:28:51,000
Okay, I'm gonna say something.

5529
04:28:51,440 --> 04:28:55,580
I had issues with the game when I first installed it.

5530
04:28:56,120 --> 04:29:02,960
me make like a server it like wouldn't connect to the server
so i had to like do a bunch of finangling with it but um

5531
04:29:02,960 --> 04:29:12,340
apparently like that's a known issue but um so i was like
going into the world i was going i'd like made a creative

5532
04:29:12,340 --> 04:29:19,640
world to like kind of be like maybe it's something like to
see if i was connected online and where i spawned was like

5533
04:29:19,640 --> 04:29:21,020
right next to a dragon

5534
04:29:27,520 --> 04:29:31,080
I wonder if there, if we'll see a dragon.

5535
04:29:32,760 --> 04:29:34,040
Kiara and Kali had the same issue.

5536
04:29:34,460 --> 04:29:36,260
Yeah, I think it's like a known bug thing.

5537
04:29:36,760 --> 04:29:39,340
So imagine dragons.

5538
04:29:40,560 --> 04:29:42,040
Luckily, I was in creative.

5539
04:29:42,460 --> 04:29:44,160
So it didn't like kill me.

5540
04:29:44,220 --> 04:29:45,800
Which there is like a creative mode.

5541
04:29:46,340 --> 04:29:50,120
Oh, I don't, I think I, I think I deleted it.

5542
04:29:50,180 --> 04:29:52,520
Because I was like, oh, it was just like me testing to see
like.

5543
04:29:52,920 --> 04:29:55,280
Because I was like, am I, how do I get online?

5544
04:29:55,280 --> 04:30:09,760
like is it because when you here i'll just show you if i go
back into the server the art is so cute um one second

5545
04:30:12,970 --> 04:30:19,430
because i was reading you had to set up the server here and
so i was like online play and i was like wait it's not

5546
04:30:19,430 --> 04:30:27,050
working you know whatever whatever so yeah but it's so cute
oh this game is so fun!

5547
04:30:27,430 --> 04:30:28,750
There's so much to explore.

5548
04:30:29,370 --> 04:30:31,490
And then also, I knew about the map.

5549
04:30:32,050 --> 04:30:36,190
I knew about, you know, press M for the map or whatever,
when I first tried it.

5550
04:30:36,850 --> 04:30:39,110
But I thought it was literally only that circle.

5551
04:30:40,210 --> 04:30:43,370
I did it, I was like, wow, this map is actually, like, so
small.

5552
04:30:43,570 --> 04:30:48,590
Okay, I guess there's not going to be much to... I was like,
I guess there's not going to be much to explore, but there

5553
04:30:48,590 --> 04:30:50,370
was actually so much to explore!

5554
04:30:54,110 --> 04:30:54,450
Yeah!

5555
04:30:55,150 --> 04:30:56,030
I'm so happy.

5556
04:30:56,150 --> 04:30:56,630
This is so fun.

5557
04:30:59,290 --> 04:30:59,770
I'm...

5558
04:30:59,770 --> 04:31:00,330
Yippee!

5559
04:31:01,170 --> 04:31:01,830
It's infinite!

5560
04:31:02,070 --> 04:31:02,850
Oh wow!

5561
04:31:03,210 --> 04:31:03,950
She didn't scroll.

5562
04:31:04,530 --> 04:31:05,010
No!

5563
04:31:05,450 --> 04:31:08,850
It like unlock- the map unlocks as you explore more!

5564
04:31:09,210 --> 04:31:10,950
That's why I thought it was so small!

5565
04:31:13,470 --> 04:31:15,410
That's why I thought it was so small!

5566
04:31:16,450 --> 04:31:18,810
But so far, I think, um...

5567
04:31:18,810 --> 04:31:20,650
I would say it's...

5568
04:31:21,550 --> 04:31:26,630
I mean, I think it was like what, seven years ago or
something that it got announced and then it like...

5569
04:31:26,650 --> 04:31:32,670
And then the team disbanded, and then it was cancelled, and
then it came back, and all this stuff.

5570
04:31:33,230 --> 04:31:43,830
And so, I think, though, I think they've definitely put in a
lot of stuff, or, like, a lot of thought into everything so

5571
04:31:43,830 --> 04:31:44,150
far.

5572
04:31:44,530 --> 04:31:46,030
So, it looks so pretty.

5573
04:31:46,150 --> 04:31:46,990
It really does.

5574
04:31:47,550 --> 04:31:53,650
It looks so pretty, and there's so many, like, little things
you can grab, like, skulls, like, just falling into that

5575
04:31:53,650 --> 04:31:54,410
bug's nest.

5576
04:31:54,690 --> 04:31:55,850
Like, oh, my gosh, so cool.

5577
04:31:56,650 --> 04:32:12,570
3d terraria it really is it's so fun so so fun yeah
crossbows don't look miserable to use getting kicked by a

5578
04:32:12,570 --> 04:32:26,830
horse into a cave and I heard dinosaurs are getting added
like actually I know there's so many animals I want to zoom

5579
04:32:26,830 --> 04:32:34,150
and like We didn't even touch so many aspects, like the
building aspect and the...

5580
04:32:34,150 --> 04:32:36,270
We just kind of explored, which I'm okay with.

5581
04:32:36,330 --> 04:32:37,650
Like I said, this is a new game.

5582
04:32:37,750 --> 04:32:39,590
I want to see all that I could see of it.

5583
04:32:40,290 --> 04:32:41,310
And then I can build.

5584
04:32:41,430 --> 04:32:48,290
But like, we could settle down and have a little cottage and
a farm and some animals and everything.

5585
04:32:48,790 --> 04:32:49,770
Dinos are already in!

5586
04:32:53,070 --> 04:32:54,150
I missed them.

5587
04:32:54,830 --> 04:32:56,230
I did not see the dinos.

5588
04:32:56,790 --> 04:32:58,730
What kind of dinos are we talking about?

5589
04:33:00,250 --> 04:33:02,310
What are we talking about, anyway?

5590
04:33:05,830 --> 04:33:07,030
That's our dino.

5591
04:33:16,840 --> 04:33:18,420
Hopefully, iguana dines.

5592
04:33:18,660 --> 04:33:19,860
I sure hope so.

5593
04:33:22,020 --> 04:33:22,540
I sure hope.

5594
04:33:22,600 --> 04:33:23,820
You have to dig down.

5595
04:33:26,260 --> 04:33:27,980
Then we'll get them next time.

5596
04:33:29,120 --> 04:33:31,000
The version, actually, the version from...

5597
04:33:31,000 --> 04:33:34,260
Wait, interesting to think this is actually the version from
five years ago.

5598
04:33:35,460 --> 04:33:35,960
Publisher.

5599
04:33:36,540 --> 04:33:39,400
Makes you wonder how much more they need to recreate now.

5600
04:33:46,540 --> 04:33:47,580
Matara, kind of.

5601
04:33:47,620 --> 04:33:48,840
Matara's our dinosaur.

5602
04:33:51,000 --> 04:33:52,320
Yeah, is there Ketzel Coatlas?

5603
04:33:52,520 --> 04:33:53,360
That's a huge question.

5604
04:33:53,560 --> 04:33:54,400
Very big question.

5605
04:33:54,980 --> 04:33:56,400
Very, very big question.

5606
04:33:59,760 --> 04:34:01,340
This is so fun, though.

5607
04:34:02,040 --> 04:34:05,140
Matara's like a great person to be explored with.

5608
04:34:06,560 --> 04:34:13,860
yeah i had a lot of fun i hope you guys did too i am so
hungry i was just feeding on some pretz do you guys know

5609
04:34:13,860 --> 04:34:22,940
pretz they're so yummy right if you've ever had them they're
like pocky they're like pocky without the chocolate and it's

5610
04:34:22,940 --> 04:34:32,120
like a biscuit stick but flavored and so this one is
flavored tomato they're so yummy yeah savory pocky yeah yeah

5611
04:34:32,120 --> 04:34:37,140
yeah except it's not like you know a coat of stuff.

5612
04:34:37,260 --> 04:34:38,580
It's like seasoning.

5613
04:34:39,280 --> 04:34:40,160
They're tasty.

5614
04:34:41,220 --> 04:34:42,380
Tasty, tasty, tasty.

5615
04:34:45,120 --> 04:34:45,600
Tomato.

5616
04:34:46,400 --> 04:34:47,560
Never heard of tomato flavored.

5617
04:34:47,700 --> 04:34:48,580
It's not a pretzel.

5618
04:34:49,360 --> 04:34:50,780
It's called pretz.

5619
04:34:50,880 --> 04:34:52,800
P-R-T-T-Z.

5620
04:34:53,640 --> 04:34:53,960
Pretz.

5621
04:34:54,140 --> 04:34:59,000
I think they're even made by the same people that make
pocket even.

5622
04:35:00,240 --> 04:35:01,860
Pizza one is nice too.

5623
04:35:02,720 --> 04:35:03,640
