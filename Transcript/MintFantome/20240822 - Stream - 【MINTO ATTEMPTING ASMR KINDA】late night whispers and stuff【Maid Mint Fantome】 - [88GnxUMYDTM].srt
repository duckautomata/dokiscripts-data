1
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,880
What if someone screams in the middle?

2
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,800
That is not the audio.

3
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,540
That's real.

4
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,440
That's the real thunder.

5
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,330
Get your

6
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,130
little ear to sleep.

7
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,770
Why can't there be seagulls?

8
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,090
What's wrong with seagulls?

9
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,810
Don't you like the seagulls?

10
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,450
Isn't it relaxing?

11
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,030
It can rain when there are seagulls.

12
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,110
Okay, the

13
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,320
sirens are definitely the audio.

14
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,140
Why are there so many sirens in this audio?

15
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,580
The BGM is too loud.

16
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,080
Is it really?

17
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,110
Is that butter?

18
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,320
It's so crazy.

19
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,900
The streets are flooding a little bit.

20
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,620
So today I will not go out

21
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,420
with Kyoro.

22
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,120
Yesterday we

23
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,860
went to a restaurant and missed everything.

24
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:30,180
We were inside in a restaurant and it rained while we were there.

25
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,880
It was done, so it was good.

26
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,760
How is my voice by the way?

27
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,900
Do I sound okay?

28
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,780
I'm sorry that it's not the in-both-ears type of ASMR, but...

29
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,790
Glad Wawa didn't vacuum you up.

30
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:19,030
I mean, she did a little, but I'm too strong.

31
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,250
I'm too powerful.

32
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,010
Monomito.

33
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,210
I have some things too for maybe ASMR.

34
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,250
And I also have...

35
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,170
I was a little...

36
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,230
A little stressed about...

37
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,130
About this stream.

38
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,590
So I didn't eat breakfast.

39
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,230
It's

40
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,540
because my volume was low.

41
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,660
Is it still too loud?

42
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,020
Okay.

43
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,000
Me

44
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,260
crippled ASMR.

45
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,380
No, I have a yogurt right here.

46
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,920
Cough drop.

47
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,400
Me ASMR as a hair stylist.

48
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,900
I have scissors.

49
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,560
Wait, let me go get them.

50
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,510
I have scissors.

51
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,310
6 to 1.

52
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,030
I

53
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,700
have wheeled scissors.

54
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,700
I feel I must have a southern accent.

55
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,820
It's my favorite VTuber made turquoise real life.

56
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,960
Thanks and good night.

57
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,500
Good night.

58
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,150
Sweet dreams.

59
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,740
I almost knocked over my mic.

60
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,940
Oh my...

61
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,610
What the?

62
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,610
Was that a cat?

63
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,300
I wish there was a cat.

64
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,400
Cat in my room.

65
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,300
It is in your ear.

66
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,300
You know what I mean?

67
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,300
What I can do is this.

68
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:30,860
Hold on.

69
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,640
Let me try something.

70
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,380
Let me try something.

71
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,060
Am I in your left ear now?

72
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,540
No.

73
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,220
I hear someone walking.

74
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,340
Creepy.

75
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,040
Get out of my stream.

76
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
I'm still getting my cough drop by the way.

77
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:25,760
Static.

78
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,990
I kept using the scissors and now I'm bald.

79
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,150
I also have other accessories.

80
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,630
I have...

81
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,660
I've just dropped my mic again.

82
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,020
I also have a used sock.

83
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,910
It's like my softest sock so I used it.

84
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,530
For this too.

85
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,070
It's multifunctional.

86
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:37,700
I wore it yesterday and then the day I use it for ASMR.

87
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,100
But

88
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,480
this is the main event.

89
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,060
Is this ASMR?

90
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,260
You're

91
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,590
doing great, sweaty.

92
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,990
Can't

93
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,960
there be the C?

94
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,260
What's

95
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,480
wrong with the C?

96
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,320
Can you whisper the ingredients of oxy?

97
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,090
Okay, this is from...

98
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,090
Surf...

99
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,110
Surf...

100
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,570
Surf...

101
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,290
Surfactants.

102
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,070
Surf...

103
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,030
Thank you so much.

104
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,850
How does OxiClean work?

105
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,240
OxiClean?

106
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,040
For milk?

107
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,130
Anyone who's tried our products.

108
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,030
Mindy

109
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,640
Mae is here.

110
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,760
Ask them how.

111
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,540
You

112
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,860
ask someone if they're not sure if it works.

113
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,060
Or ask them how it works and they won't be so sure.

114
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,260
The answer is simple.

115
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,060
Oxygen.

116
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,500
The

117
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,840
20 years ago, scientists came up with Oxygen.

118
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,820
A way to harness the power of Oxygen.

119
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,200
Sorry.

120
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,350
Can you guys hear my computer?

121
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,570
Not really?

122
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,690
Okay, good.

123
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:21,420
I also have to use as ASMR.

124
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,730
Turn the BGM down even more.

125
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,030
So

126
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,270
I have some yogurt here.

127
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,260
Where'd I put my spoon?

128
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,420
Oh, here we go.

129
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,620
So basically, this is my favorite yogurt to get every time I'm in Japan.

130
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,740
So it has chunks of aloe in it.

131
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,440
And I get it for breakfast, like, all the time.

132
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,260
Itadakimasu.

133
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,250
Yummy.

134
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,010
No, you can't have some.

135
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,210
Little,

136
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,630
oh my gosh, cherry.

137
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,730
Thank you for the pep.

138
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
It's really embarrassing.

139
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,620
Can you hear me chewing it?

140
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,020
Hold on, I'll get a chunk of the actual...

141
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,470
Did you make, did you hear me gulp?

142
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,150
Not so much.

143
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,430
Okay, a little bit.

144
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:19,870
Oh gosh.

145
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,730
This is nice.

146
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,050
I'm not even wearing my headphones.

147
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,270
Yippee.

148
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,830
I guess that

149
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,830
doesn't matter if she's turquoise.

150
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,010
I'm not turquoise.

151
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,780
I am not turquoise.

152
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,880
Don't let Takanashi Kyoro gaslight you.

153
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,180
I am mint.

154
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,480
I am not turquoise.

155
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,160
I am not mid turquoise.

156
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:52,480
I am

157
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,690
don't let Takanashi Kyoro gaslight...

158
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,220
Okay, I'm sorry.

159
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,870
I was laughing so I had to mute.

160
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:36,380
I actually really like that song when she sang it.

161
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,380
I think there

162
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:58,000
are many things that you want me to say and do the ASMR sounds.

163
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,680
Thank you.

164
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:02,860
Hello.

165
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,480
Not minto.

166
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,600
Yes, minto.

167
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,690
Mid turquoise channel.

168
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:15,410
This is a mid mid channel.

169
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,510
If you want turquoise...

170
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,500
Wait, turquoise is a what?

171
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,920
Mid turquoise sounds like a Steven Universe.

172
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,460
Hayden, thank you for the...

173
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,090
There's this turquoise mid cosplayer outside my window in the rain.

174
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,260
Watch this, watch this.

175
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,950
It's kind of spooky though, isn't it?

176
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,080
So spooky.

177
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,520
Okay,

178
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,860
there's a small Super Toad's better mic.

179
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,000
Would he be the better mic?

180
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,040
Is my mic not good?

181
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,900
Is

182
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,220
my mic okay?

183
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,020
Come

184
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,140
too embarrassed.

185
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,360
To try it.

186
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,230
Do a silly roleplay.

187
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,380
RP ASMR trying to sell me on extending my car warranty.

188
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:39,740
RP ASMR trying to sell me on extending my car warranty.

189
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,450
Here goes to mid.

190
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,890
Everybody else, they're unpredictable.

191
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,850
You can be the best driver in the world.

192
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,450
Here, come here.

193
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,110
Let me show you this.

194
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,170
Look right here.

195
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,060
This is the best warranty you'll ever...

196
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,400
This

197
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:55,650
is the best warranty you'll ever...

198
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,470
I'm gonna say this nice and slow for you.

199
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:58,730
I'm gonna say this nice and slow for you.

200
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,330
Right here, okay?

201
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,550
I'm gonna say this in a way that...

202
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,310
It's an offer you can't refuse.

203
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,880
Isn't that just what makes you melt?

204
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,440
Thank

205
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,030
you.

206
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,690
This isn't about...

207
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,230
No, no.

208
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,750
The extended warranty.

209
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,320
It costs so much time.

210
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,920
We offer the best of the best

211
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:35,870
insurance.

212
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,450
One in a million.

213
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,520
This is a phone call.

214
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,160
No, it's not.

215
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,980
Could you just let me in?

216
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,300
Could you just...

217
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:56,660
Could you just...

218
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,340
Lifeforce there.

219
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,020
I'm a pretty ugly ghost, you know?

220
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,520
All we gotta do is get you to sign the dotted line.

221
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,000
And then I'll just, uh...

222
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,660
You know...

223
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,700
You won't even feel it.

224
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,480
You'll just feel like a little woozy afterwards.

225
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,620
Maybe.

226
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:44,820
Lifeforce.

227
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,840
And you get the best warranty of your life.

228
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,150
And ghosts...

229
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,430
You know, I have to feed on your lifeforce a little bit.

230
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,350
Done

231
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,750
your lifeforce a little bit.

232
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:19,690
Oh,

233
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:30,870
is that...

234
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,350
Gochisousamadeshita.

235
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,470
Thank you for the lifeforce.

236
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,400
Thank you for your service.

237
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
And, um...

238
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,060
Itadakimasu.

239
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,310
Back to my breakfast now.

240
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,440
I just got here.

241
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,020
Am I safe?

242
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,750
No.

243
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,980
I am an evil ghost after all.

244
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,680
I think yogurt was not good for me to have for my throat.

245
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Because it's making me like...

246
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,540
It's the dairy, you know?

247
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,700
It's making my throat

248
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,450
like...

249
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:42,190
And giggling about it is perhaps the best possible result.

250
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,160
I want to succeed.

251
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:00,320
The good ASMR that helps you go to sleep.

252
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,460
Do you guys feel relaxed from this?

253
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,260
Are you feeling relaxed and sleepy?

254
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,980
I

255
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,460
did the night shades.

256
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,180
So that it was dark in my room.

257
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,900
That's really relaxing.

258
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,760
Do I listen to ASMR?

259
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,880
I listen to...

260
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,560
Actually, there's a YouTube channel I listen to called ASMR Twigs.

261
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,360
And it's basically a girl and her sister.

262
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,720
And they go to hair spas and massage places in Tokyo.

263
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,520
And their videos are so relaxing.

264
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,500
And my headphones maxed and it's perfect.

265
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,640
Good, good, good.

266
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,480
I have difficult news.

267
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,880
This is really cute.

268
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,380
Shut up.

269
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,080
Hack up.

270
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,080
Shut up.

271
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,700
No, twigs.

272
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:40,900
Twigs.

273
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,040
Like the candy.

274
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,680
Twigs.

275
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,780
Twigs, twigs, twigs.

276
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,080
And not some of the blue archive ASMR tricks.

277
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,720
I'll be honest.

278
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,040
I get embarrassed listening to those kinds of things.

279
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,500
So...

280
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,240
I don't.

281
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,760
I don't ever listen to them.

282
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,940
But yeah, ASMR twigs.

283
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,740
And then...

284
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,190
Recently in Tokyo.

285
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,460
So...

286
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,540
Sorry, I keep forgetting sometimes to go back left and right.

287
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,800
To

288
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:40,860
her head spa.

289
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,100
I'm so excited.

290
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,420
Yeah.

291
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,100
I'm so excited because my ears are

292
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:01,860
so relaxing.

293
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,080
But if you want, like, sexy ASMR...

294
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,380
I don't really...

295
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:06,900
I don't...

296
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,300
I...

297
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:07,720
I...

298
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:43,150
What is your favorite sexy ASMRist?

299
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,550
But it's also hard, right?

300
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,790
Because on YouTube, those things are typically...

301
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,640
They think I'm too sexy in this.

302
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,940
Am I being too sexy in my ASMR?

303
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,440
Just

304
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,420
too sexy?

305
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,380
Oh

306
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:38,800
my god.

307
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,500
This is too much for us to handle.

308
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,860
Okay, I'm gonna get a channel strike.

309
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,500
The Chinese sexy ASMRist.

310
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,760
Only moderately sexy.

311
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,600
Why is this ghost hunting my ears?

312
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,130
I'm hunting your ears.

313
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,350
I'm so close to your ear.

314
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,430
This is where I can get the live voice from.

315
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,860
I'll just suck it out like that.

316
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,700
Does the wax actually work?

317
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:44,940
No, this is my favorite flavor.

318
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,880
I used to eat the wax on those wax bottle candies, you know?

319
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,380
Did you ever have those as a kid?

320
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,860
Where, like, you'll...

321
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,760
It was a bottle of wax.

322
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,240
And then on the inside was, like, a fruity juice.

323
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,220
And I didn't know the wax was bad.

324
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,200
I would just...

325
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,140
I would just...

326
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,960
You know, I'm just giving you this warning.

327
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:10,900
Please, don't.

328
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,660
You know, I'm just giving you this warning.

329
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:14,680
You know, I'm just giving you this warning.

330
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,360
If only you knew what kind of ASMR stuff is out there on YouTube.

331
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,640
I know.

332
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,280
I just... I

333
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,770
thought you were supposed to eat the wax.

334
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:58,770
Now I'm second guessing.

335
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:58,850
I'm listening.

336
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,630
Wait, second guessing.

337
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:02,770
I love it.

338
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:07,470
It's

339
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,360
getting too sexy.

340
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,460
I

341
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,610
know you get so embarrassed, but...

342
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,010
This is true.

343
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,290
This is peak woman.

344
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,570
Eating wax.

345
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,030
Selling car warranties.

346
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,870
To

347
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,490
do like those ear cleaning places.

348
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,870
What if it's not just ear cleaning?

349
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,450
Like what if it's a sexy ear cleaning?

350
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,870
I don't think I'll be able to help.

351
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:10,970
I'm scared.

352
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,970
And also, what if they pull out a worm?

353
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,420
It was living in there and I'm getting really scared.

354
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,700
I don't want to live the rest of my afterlife.

355
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,500
Knowing that there was a worm in my ear.

356
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,220
If there's any worms in your ears.

357
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,760
I'm eating them right now.

358
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,400
So don't worry.

359
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,040
All

360
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,670
the earworms in my ear.

361
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,450
But you don't have to worry.

362
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,470
Because I'll clean them out for you.

363
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,770
Hold on, I'm gonna scoop out your earworms.

364
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,260
Let's get the left side first.

365
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,000
Okay, hold on.

366
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,170
Let's try the right side now.

367
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,030
There's a worm in there.

368
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,080
Oh, there's a whole family of worms.

369
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,430
I successfully cleaned your ears.

370
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,310
How do you feel?

371
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,930
Do you feel refreshed?

372
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:26,270
Without

373
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:36,930
the worms, I'm lonely.

374
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,390
Don't worry, I just made room for the spiders.

375
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,650
Isn't this so relaxing, you guys?

376
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,170
Rain

377
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:58,990
of spiders.

378
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:06,790

MAmagici SPIDER

380
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:53,890
MAGAZINE She's like, you sure drink a lot of apple juice, but it was all you could drink, so of course I was going to get my fill of apple juice.

381
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,220
The snake called howl when he saw me.

382
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,840
Stop, you're going to make me blush.

383
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,220
Stop.

384
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,980
I'm actually at my thing.

385
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:41,360
She sent me a... she was like, hey, I have this snake picture, but it's kind of not safe for work.

386
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,600
Is it still okay if I send it?

387
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,350
I was like, it's too NSFW for me.

388
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,510
So she sent it.

389
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,310
And I was like...

390
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:05,600
Fujo and Yumejo for snake.

391
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:11,250
Life is so good.

392
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:17,210
If it shows up in your timeline, I'm sorry because I favorited it on me.

393
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:34,290
I get to eat everything because I'm Yume, so I'm just like, if I see, you know, a good thing.

394
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,400
But if I see, you know, like a berry.

395
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,860
Or something like with Otacon or whatever.

396
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,680
I'm just like, this is so good.

397
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,020
So I'm just eating everything, baby.

398
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,570
Do you guys want to see the picture?

399
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:55,150
Hold on.

400
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,430
Actually, I feel like it will be gone.

401
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,220
Since she's the one that sent it to me.

402
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,260
You know, I...

403
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,360
Actually, I've liked some pretty...

404
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,980
Oh wait, this post is from a long time ago.

405
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,680
Okay, sorry, berry.

406
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,940
I'm putting you on blast.

407
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,160
Okay, here it is.

408
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:30,880
Here's the tweet.

409
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,900
How did you find this?

410
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,100
I don't know how she found this one.

411
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,800
I wonder if she just likes the artist.

412
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,140
I can't tell.

413
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,140
What do you guys think?

414
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,320
Oh, I didn't send it.

415
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:54,500
Sorry.

416
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,220
Here you go.

417
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,940
I am normal.

418
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,880
I'm normal.

419
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,210
I'm normal.

420
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,050
I'm normal.

421
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,270
I'm normal.

422
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,520
Left or right?

423
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:53,860
Left.

424
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,060
Because I love Blisken.

425
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,420
I love Blisken a normal amount.

426
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,300
You know?

427
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:22,080
My favorite thing is that Barry was like, is this too much to send to you?

428
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:27,660
And here I am just linking it in my chat and saying, here you go, guys.

429
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,460
Everybody can enjoy the Snipples.

430
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,440
And

431
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:56,700
I need some, if you guys could just send some offerings for me besides this yogurt.

432
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,160
Eat

433
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,040
my breakfast, finally.

434
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,160
Even though it's almost 1pm.

435
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,000
I

436
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,520
hope you guys enjoyed this.

437
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:23,270
How do ghosts get hungry?

438
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:24,310
Oh, we can.

439
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,410
Can I request some quick go-go-go?

440
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,290
What is a go-go-go?

441
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,000
Oh, yes, we have to rate the go-go-go up to sleep.

442
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,280
Yes, someone requested.

443
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,140
Okay, okay.

444
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:45,740
We have a

445
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,610
first go-go.

446
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:10,710
We'll do some sort of special 250k stream at some point.

447
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:12,050
I'm not sure when.

448
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:16,030
Oh, just say go-go-go-go-go-go.

449
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,440
Sell go-go.

450
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,080
This is a story called, go the fuck to sleep.

451
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:39,630
Page, stop.

452
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:41,110
Are you kidding me?

453
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:46,070
I have to wait for, unlock this page after an ad, skip ad, skippa-skippa.

454
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:47,610
The

455
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,640
cats nestle close to their kittens now.

456
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,860
The lambs have been laid down with the sheep.

457
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,060
You're cozy and warm in your bed, my dear.

458
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,820
Please, go the fuck to sleep.

459
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:10,530
I have to wait for an ad.

460
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,100
Skip ad.

461
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:20,180
The

462
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,550
windows are dark in the town,

463
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,260
very last book, if you swear.

464
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,380
You will go the fuck to sleep.

465
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:44,120
The eagles who soar.

466
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Oh, shit.

467
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,200
The eagles who soar through the sky are at rest.

468
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,440
And the creatures who crawl, run and creep.

469
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,420
I know you're not thirsty.

470
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,460
That's bullshit.

471
01:05:58,680 --> 01:05:59,620
Stop lying.

472
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,970
Lie down and sleep.

473
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:10,960
The wind whispers soft through the grass, hun.

474
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,600
The field mice, they make not a peep.

475
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,760
It's been thirty-eight minutes already.

476
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,960
Jesus Christ, what the fuck.

477
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,260
Go to sleep.

478
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,180
Froggy has made his last leap.

479
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,560
Help them.

480
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,480
The owls fly forth from there.

481
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,520
They soar and they zeep.

482
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:53,700
Sweep.

483
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:59,600
A hot crimson rage fills my heart, love.

484
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,660
For real.

485
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,560
The cubs and the lions are snoring.

486
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,740
Wrapped in a big snuggly heap.

487
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:19,060
How is it you can do all this other great shit, but you can't lie the fuck down and sleep?

488
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,540
The seeds slumber beneath the earth now.

489
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,920
And the crops that the farmers will reap.

490
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:29,980
No more questions.

491
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,660
This interview's over.

492
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,260
I've got two words for you, kid.

493
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:35,660
Fucking sleep.

494
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:36,820
Gosh,

495
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:42,730
I was reading it and then an ad popped up.

496
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,770
Hold on, I have to wait ten seconds again.

497
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,530
Reclines in the shimmering jungle.

498
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,450
Oh, simmering jungle, sorry.

499
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:58,930
The sparrow has silenced her jeep.

500
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:01,050
A cure-stuffed bear.

501
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,470
I'm not kidding you, shit.

502
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:03,810
Close your eyes.

503
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:04,950
Cut the crap.

504
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:06,310
Sleep.

505
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:17,670
Hold on one second.

506
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:18,850
It's almost done.

507
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,920
The flowers doze low in the meadows.

508
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:27,740
Oh, sorry.

509
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,160
Am I on one ear this whole time?

510
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,040
I'm so sorry, you guys.

511
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:35,440
I can't see it, so I didn't know to change it.

512
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:35,880
Sorry, sorry.

513
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,960
The flowers doze low in the meadows.

514
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,920
And high on the mountains, so steep.

515
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:45,500
My life is a failure.

516
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,080
I'm a shitty-ass bear.

517
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,080
Stop fucking with me, please.

518
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,280
And sleep.

519
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:50,500
Sleep.

520
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,080
Skip ad.

521
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:01,700
The giant pangolins of Madagascar are snoozing as I lie here and openly weep.

522
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,620
Sure, fine, whatever.

523
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,500
I'll bring you some milk.

524
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,860
Who the fuck cares?

525
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,500
You're not gonna sleep.

526
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,760
This realm is all I can remember.

527
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,780
Your furniture.

528
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,800
Oh, crappy and cheap.

529
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,240
You win.

530
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,320
You escape.

531
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:24,180
You run down the hall as I nod the fuck off.

532
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,320
And sleep.

533
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,670
Free and dazed, I awaken.

534
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:33,970
Define your eyes shut, so I keep.

535
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:37,850
My fingers cross tight as I tiptoe away.

536
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:38,710
Fucking.

537
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:41,110
Asleep.

538
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,820
Popcorns in the microwave.

539
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,020
Beep.

540
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:51,900
For

541
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,630
letting me whisper in your ear.

542
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:17,590
Thank you for signing your soul away in the, um, warranty.

543
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:21,470
Thanks for feeding me

544
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:29,030
sweet dreams.

545
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:33,250
Don't let the worms bite.

546
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:34,310
She

547
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,210
wants to use this for sleeping.

548
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,750
Which if you do, I'm not sure what.

549
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:50,470
But, uh, here.

550
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:50,950
Oh, oh.

551
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:55,880
I made that dress one more time.

552
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,920
She's going to use it a little.

553
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,760
A little something.

554
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:58,900
It's so beautiful.

555
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:58,940
Oh!
