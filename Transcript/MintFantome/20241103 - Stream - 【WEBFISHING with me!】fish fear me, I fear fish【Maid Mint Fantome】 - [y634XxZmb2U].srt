1
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,830
Oops.

2
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,240
Forgot to turn on the music.

3
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,650
Welcome.

4
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,580
You like my hat?

5
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,640
Thank you.

6
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,540
I am a being to be feared.

7
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,180
I am...

8
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,960
The creature.

9
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,320
Today we're fishing.

10
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,180
Whether we're web fishing...

11
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,180
If hopefully all goes well...

12
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,900
I don't know.

13
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:52,820
Someone might be editing this at this very moment into a subtle foreshadowing type clip at this very moment.

14
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,180
If all goes well...

15
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,540
We will be web fishing.

16
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,180
And if not, then...

17
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,820
There's other fish in the sea.

18
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,220
In a different pond.

19
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,420
In a different location.

20
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,160
Yeah, my PC might explode.

21
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,060
That would be really exciting.

22
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,140
You look like you just finished your shift at the Krusty Krab.

23
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,380
Kind of.

24
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,320
Morning, Kevin.

25
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Good morning.

26
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,420
I'm so sleepy.

27
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,060
Such a lazy Sunday.

28
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,820
And I have to go out later.

29
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,380
I have to go...

30
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,180
I have to leave my maid cafe, which is why...

31
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,420
Today is kind of early.

32
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,640
But I just feel lazy.

33
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,780
I don't want to do anything.

34
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
I'm tired.

35
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,260
I'm drinking my tea.

36
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,280
And I'm looking at web fishing.

37
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,500
Is this the Krusty Maid?

38
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,940
Don't call me that.

39
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't say that.

40
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,040
Oh my gosh.

41
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,440
Don't call the Krusty Maid.

42
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,060
You changed your clocks.

43
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,620
Yeah, wait.

44
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,210
It automatically...

45
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,840
It automatically changed.

46
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,720
On my phone and my computer.

47
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,240
No, this is Patrick.

48
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,100
Joshua!

49
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,460
Can I travel my community for my first happy birthday song?

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,260
Of course.

51
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,300
Happy birthday to you.

52
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,240
Happy birthday to you.

53
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,560
Happy birthday dear Joshua.

54
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,640
Happy birthday to you.

55
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,580
Happy birthday!

56
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,360
The recordings are the vibe gifted.

57
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,680
Wow, I just got dumped last night.

58
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,380
I

59
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,960
don't know what to say.

60
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,840
Uh...

61
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,200
Uh...

62
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,430
Uh...

63
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,490
They sucked?

64
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,130
Uh...

65
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,470
Stick with Vtubers?

66
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,570
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:07,670
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,310
Yeah, I did say that there's plenty of fish in the sea.

69
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,870
I hear there's a cool new Vtuber, Spaghetti-chan.

70
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,090
Who's that?

71
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,310
What a silly name for a Vtuber.

72
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,430
What a silly name.

73
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,630
What if I create code only?

74
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:47,230
Can I get one minty patty, please?

75
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,970
Ducky, I saw your off-stream.

76
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,210
Don't know, I saw it.

77
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,330
I saw it.

78
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,710
I see y'all.

79
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,090
I saw it.

80
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,250
Sorry.

81
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:03,550
Sorry.

82
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,820
At this point, I'm not surprised at what people draw me as.

83
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,280
Sometimes.

84
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,920
I think the only thing I wouldn't want is like a...

85
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,620
I don't know.

86
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,520
I shouldn't say it because then people might draw it.

87
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,180
You know?

88
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
My voice is still a little icky today.

89
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,660
It's not great.

90
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,900
Currently designing a fishing minigame.

91
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,820
It's a lot trickier than I thought, but I think we'll have something cool soon.

92
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,500
Every RPG needs one.

93
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,780
It's true.

94
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,380
Every RPG needs a...

95
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,620
needs a fishing game.

96
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,860
Pasha Miiin!

97
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,980
Hello!

98
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,880
Hello, hello.

99
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,780
Long time no see.

100
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,200
Every RPG needs a mint spooky ghost.

101
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,080
Yeah.

102
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,460
Lampy!

103
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,340
Thanks for the gift.

104
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,360
Thank you, thank you.

105
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,760
So, let's ignore these losers.

106
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,920
Start the game.

107
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,090
Nice key!

108
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,030
You guys, look at me.

109
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,770
It looks just like me, doesn't it?

110
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,270
Because I'm like...

111
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,790
dead.

112
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,310
And I fished some pants.

113
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,550
It looks just like me.

114
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,330
Grease stains?

115
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,610
No, that's my...

116
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,630
that's my pattern.

117
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,450
That's my pattern, that's my pattern.

118
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,390
Pattern.

119
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,670
It looks just like me.

120
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,350
Press G?

121
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,970
What's G?

122
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,890
The song of my people.

123
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,860
You can also hold...

124
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,700
hold CTRL when you press G.

125
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
What the heck?

126
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,160
Mean mugging me.

127
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,900
What is that?

128
00:10:59,900 --> 00:10:59,920
What?

129
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,020
This is not a meow, this is... he's hissing at me.

130
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,860
Alt G?

131
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,140
This is how Pai sounds.

132
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,960
Every time I see her, she like chirps a little.

133
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,080
It's so cute.

134
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,580
Press K?

135
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,300
Oh wait, I should... towards the cat.

136
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,050
Hey.

137
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,610
Towards the cat, towards the cat.

138
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,950
See, this cat really is me.

139
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,270
What else can I press?

140
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,870
What else can I press?

141
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,610
Typing slash wag.

142
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,820
Oh, enter.

143
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,700
Oh, I have a short tail because...

144
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,480
that's just like...

145
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,840
Butaro has a small short tail, so...

146
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,280
I based that off of him.

147
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,840
So cute!

148
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,960
How do I... OK, zoom out.

149
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,100
So I only did the tutorial last night.

150
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,740
So I don't really know anything about the game.

151
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,480
You can also make expressions by typing...

152
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,840
Oh.

153
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,660
Wait, does it say what I type?

154
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,100
It does!

155
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,300
It says what I type!

156
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,340
Oh no.

157
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,280
Oh no.

158
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,920
What else can I type?

159
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,580
You can change the voice pitch too.

160
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,600
Wait, how do I do that?

161
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,160
Wait, how do I change... Wait, is it here?

162
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,220
No, it's the quest board.

163
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,020
In the backpack.

164
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,340
In the backpack.

165
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,140
Oh, customize.

166
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,140
Miscellaneous.

167
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,560
Oh, voice pitch!

168
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,440
Hi.

169
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,700
Like Super Moe voice.

170
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,740
I have 68 books.

171
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,420
Books.

172
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,350
It sounds like...

173
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:31,030
It should be illegal to be this cute.

174
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,630
I know my cat is like...

175
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,490
Does pitch change the meow?

176
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,870
No.

177
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,810
C opens the...

178
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,090
No!

179
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,370
What is this?

180
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,050
Oh my gosh, cute!

181
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,350
Sit.

182
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,490
This game is so cute.

183
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,710
Oh, I'm still sitting.

184
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,170
Oh wait, how do I stand up?

185
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,710
Oh gosh.

186
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,790
Oh no, what was it?

187
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,650
Wait, what was to bring up the menu?

188
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,550
Oh, not K.

189
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,250
Oh, C.

190
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,390
What's this one?

191
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:23,610
Ahaha.

192
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,510
Catmit was just spitting some facts then.

193
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,400
It doesn't sound so much like what I was typing before anymore.

194
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,900
Sometimes I hear it.

195
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,280
Oh, my voice is really bad today.

196
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,080
I'm sorry guys.

197
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,160
I forgot to take my medicine.

198
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,740
That helps my throat.

199
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,300
Wow, I just want to look around real quick.

200
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,360
Oh no, I'm nervous though, because I didn't realize I thought only the chat box worked.

201
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,860
I didn't think that also...

202
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,440
Birds.

203
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,580
I didn't think that also it would show up above their heads, so hopefully nothing bad happens.

204
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,560
Hopefully, we're okay.

205
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,220
Wow, is this a magic mushroom?

206
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,310
Yeah, I'll probably make the code a members thing.

207
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,770
So, yeah.

208
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,670
We'll see how it goes.

209
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,770
Right now, I'm just exploring a little bit.

210
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,490
Oh my gosh, can I fish from here?

211
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:18,990
Sit.

212
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:20,990
Sit.

213
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,360
Reminds me of Outer Wilds.

214
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:28,780
Right!

215
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,720
Wait, it's raining.

216
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,180
No.

217
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,400
I can't fish though.

218
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,400
Oh my gosh, my face.

219
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,600
I don't think I... Oh wait, what?

220
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,040
Here I go.

221
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,940
Fish!

222
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,380
No, I can't fish from here.

223
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,660
So sad.

224
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:46,780
Again.

225
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,740
It is kind of Outer Wilds-esque though, isn't it?

226
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,260
Oh, it's raining.

227
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,220
Does that bring out rarer fish?

228
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,660
Middle mouse click to rotate without...

229
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,520
I still have to do this though.

230
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,940
Wait, how do I get down?

231
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,980
I'm trapped up here?

232
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,260
Uh oh.

233
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,940
What's happening to me?

234
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,000
What am I doing?

235
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,060
What's going on?

236
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,300
What just happened?

237
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,720
Okay, here I go.

238
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,640
We're fine.

239
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,820
Everything's okay.

240
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,060
There's like... The music is kind of inconsistent.

241
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,100
Oh shoot.

242
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:47,880
Oh my gosh.

243
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,340
I'm gonna die out here.

244
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,420
Can I drown?

245
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,220
Oh, kind of.

246
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,020
I can kind of drown.

247
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,260
What was I gonna say though?

248
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,380
Oh, what's down there?

249
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,920
A pathway.

250
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,440
Okay, we have to be good.

251
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,620
We have to be good at the game.

252
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,080
Oh.

253
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,920
Oh shoot.

254
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,560
No.

255
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,260
Oh, we're good.

256
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:18,940
Secret.

257
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,380
What is this?

258
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,100
What is this?

259
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,240
Parkour.

260
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:27,760
Parkour.

261
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,740
Thanks for the gifteds.

262
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,280
Oh no!

263
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,860
Oh, what the hell just...

264
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,120
Oh my goodness.

265
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,860
Oh my God.

266
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,240
Why do I leap sometimes?

267
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
And why do I sometimes...

268
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,540
Just jump.

269
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,540
What the hell?

270
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,840
GS5 dive.

271
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,100
It's true.

272
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,620
Hello.

273
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,620
Jump in the air is a leap.

274
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,020
Oh, it's a double jump.

275
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,820
I see, I see.

276
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,280
Okay.

277
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,740
Oh my gosh.

278
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:18,780
Oh my gosh.

279
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,380
The tutorial didn't teach me the double jump.

280
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,440
I don't think.

281
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,700
Is that a fish right there?

282
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,900
Oh my gosh.

283
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,360
Hold!

284
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,340
Oh gosh, I'm not fast enough.

285
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,680
Smash, smash, smash, smash.

286
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,480
I got a whole lobster.

287
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,820
What a beaut.

288
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,260
Holy moly, I got a lobster.

289
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,790
I just gotta make the next one.

290
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:23,770
Nice!

291
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,530
I got a new creature.

292
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,450
It's a spectral...a spectral.

293
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,330
That's me.

294
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,050
A spectral...

295
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,790
Spine, you feel another...an otherworldly...

296
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,850
I'm already carrying this bone.

297
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,650
Wait, what do you mean by that?

298
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,010
What's an otherworldly presence?

299
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,060
What?

300
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,060
I'm collecting a bone?

301
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,160
Bone!

302
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,300
Spooky.

303
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,780
Spectral spine.

304
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,940
Did someone die there?

305
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,600
Exciting.

306
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,860
Oh my gosh.

307
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,340
Thank you, luck.

308
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,180
Thank you.

309
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,440
What a thrill.

310
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,420
Wait, is there like spooky stuff in this game?

311
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,600
Can I find it all?

312
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,000
Can I find all the spookiness?

313
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,580
I'm haunted now.

314
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,080
No.

315
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,960
I'm already a ghost.

316
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,780
Dang.

317
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,740
We almost made it.

318
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,320
Wow, this game is crazy.

319
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,940
I didn't realize it would be so huge.

320
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,400
Oh.

321
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,740
And spooky too.

322
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,160
I'm gonna put on my own music.

323
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,400
Let's do this.

324
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,560
Settings.

325
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,200
Music volume.

326
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,420
I'll put on my own music.

327
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,440
Even though I like the music in this, it's kind of Minecraft where it's...

328
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,300
Where it's inconsistent, you know?

329
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,990
Give me a second, I don't want to blow out your ears.

330
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,710
There we go.

331
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,190
So how was your weekend?

332
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,430
Almost died again.

333
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,890
Wow, there's so much in here.

334
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,430
There's so much in this game.

335
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,250
Can I walk through here?

336
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:07,710
No.

337
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,990
Chill?

338
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,450
No.

339
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,430
I caught a super rare fish this weekend.

340
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:16,950
Let's go.

341
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,090
Didn't someone say, Fungi, that you have like a thousand hours in this game?

342
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,660
You have like the most hours ever in this game?

343
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,680
I only have 50.

344
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,080
I'm gonna explore just a little bit more around.

345
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,700
And then I'll let people in.

346
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,340
And then I'm just gonna fish.

347
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,860
And then we can chit-chat.

348
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,440
Today's stream isn't gonna be super duper long.

349
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,520
Let me know if also the BGM's a little loud.

350
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,460
But, um...

351
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,780
But, uh...

352
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:07,960
Whoa!

353
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,060
Closer!

354
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,140
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

355
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,040
Thank you!

356
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,900
A little loud?

357
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,120
Um, not super long since I'm gonna be touching grass today.

358
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,860
And, uh, you know...

359
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,140
Simple thanks for the 5 gifted!

360
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,190
I got a blue fish.

361
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,610
One fish, two fish, red fish.

362
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,770
Guys, I'm gonna become rank 2 scout soon.

363
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,290
Soon.

364
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,600
Where are the other secrets?

365
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,340
The mushrooms must be the key.

366
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,600
The key to the dead bodies.

367
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:19,890
Making a multiplayer lobby with the password makes a server, but you need to reach the helicopter from multiplayer menu.

368
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
I see something!

369
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,420
Oh!

370
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,400
Oopsie.

371
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,580
Oh, good.

372
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,480
Right here.

373
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,540
I see secret.

374
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,480
I see secret.

375
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,800
I need to reach the helicopter.

376
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,180
Where?

377
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,720
We made it!

378
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,500
New creature.

379
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,220
You caught a spectral rib!

380
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,480
Scary.

381
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,360
It's more ghost stuff!

382
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,580
I've got the bones.

383
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,520
I've got the bones.

384
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,060
Oh, wait.

385
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,360
Oh.

386
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,100
Oh my god.

387
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,360
Oh, Devon!

388
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,560
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

389
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,260
Thank you!

390
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,800
And Stuff Sharky!

391
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,920
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

392
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,680
Thank you!

393
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,140
What is this house?

394
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,800
Who is this?

395
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,220
Oh.

396
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,700
Gold watch.

397
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,160
Metal detector.

398
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,460
What?

399
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,440
Scratch off?

400
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,590
Props.

401
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,390
There's so much in this game.

402
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,110
I can get a sword.

403
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,610
Requires three blade fragments.

404
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,330
Oh, wow.

405
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,290
Oh.

406
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,750
OMG, thank yous.

407
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,150
Wait.

408
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,010
I didn't... I thought it would...

409
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,350
Ask me if I wanted to...

410
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,930
How do I do it?

411
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,330
Oh!

412
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,550
Went up to $10,000?

413
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,550
Fishing in there.

414
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,490
Wait, how do I do this?

415
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,230
When any winning number matches a number, win the cash.

416
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,750
Do I just scratch the whole thing?

417
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,020
Scratch the whole thing.

418
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,990
What do you mean I didn't win anything?

419
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,210
I didn't even finish scratching!

420
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:29,760
No.

421
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,060
One more try.

422
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,840
One more try.

423
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,620
I have enough money.

424
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,380
We're gonna win something for sure this time.

425
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,500
Okay.

426
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,570
What was that?

427
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,430
It just flew by.

428
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,530
$200.

429
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,580
Try.

430
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,400
It's telling me to try again.

431
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,580
I won $10!

432
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,600
I won $10!

433
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,630
Yeah!

434
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,810
Now I have enough money to do another one.

435
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,790
Okay, let's try it.

436
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,470
This is just like IRL gambling.

437
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,590
Yeah, but there's no stakes.

438
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,450
See?

439
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,670
It's telling me to try again.

440
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,870
There's no stakes because it's a video game.

441
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,160
I blew all my savings!

442
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,080
I blew them all!

443
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,520
Honey!

444
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,530
Wait, I can sell here.

445
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,330
The lobster.

446
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,890
I keep the spines.

447
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,190
Okay, we got more money now.

448
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,610
Okay.

449
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,490
We're gonna win it big right now.

450
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,350
Speedpanda, you're welcome to membership.

451
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,290
Thank you!

452
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:43,750
Twitter.

453
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,850
I could've won $100.

454
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,410
Dollars.

455
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,440
Come on!

456
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,600
Come on!

457
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,550
I have no more money!

458
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,790
Okay, let's fish for more money.

459
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,290
See?

460
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,010
I'm a lesson you guys.

461
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,870
Don't...

462
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,710
Don't be like me, okay?

463
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,050
I'm your...

464
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,730
Lesson.

465
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,830
Just...

466
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,690
Don't be like me.

467
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,970
Is this a really...

468
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,930
Not rare one because...

469
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,850
Because the thing was so far back?

470
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,250
A creature.

471
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,610
It's a grouper.

472
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,310
It's a grouper.

473
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,630
It's huge.

474
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,250
Guys, when I get to rank 2...

475
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,910
We'll do another one.

476
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,590
Rodrigo, thanks for the 5 gifted!

477
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,130
Okay.

478
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,010
I will...

479
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,090
I will open up the lobby soon.

480
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,770
Sorry.

481
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,970
I'm having fun with gambling now.

482
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,330
Now I just wanna keep gambling.

483
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,070
Let's go gambling!

484
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,070
You can hold again after mashing.

485
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,050
Oh, you can?

486
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,400
Ayee.

487
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,460
No lobby, only gamble.

488
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,590
You only have to mash till it passes the bar.

489
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,490
Oh.

490
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,030
Just mash through the white barrier.

491
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,350
Grampy, thanks for the gifted!

492
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,730
Minto is about to seal our gacha luck.

493
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:04,970
I don't know.

494
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,390
You know that I have like...

495
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,190
Or rather, if you watched me before, you know that I have...

496
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,190
quite possibly some of...

497
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,190
the worst luck...

498
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,510
in existence.

499
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,330
I might have some of the worst luck...

500
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,190
to ever...

501
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,590
be gifted to a person.

502
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,490
I have...

503
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,770
zero negative stats in luck.

504
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,130
I have negative stats in luck stat.

505
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,450
Then why did you gamble?

506
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,930
Cuz it's fun!

507
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,670
Cuz it's so much fun.

508
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:52,110
What do you mean, except in Holocure?

509
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,190
I did though, I got a shiny...

510
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,950
Okay, I have a question about Holocure.

511
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,470
For anybody who knows.

512
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,130
For the fish...

513
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,290
There's an achievement to fish all fish.

514
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,690
Right?

515
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,170
Does that include the shiny fish?

516
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,010
Or...

517
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,110
Do I just have to get all types of fish?

518
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,290
It doesn't need the shiny ones.

519
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,200
Where's my fish here?

520
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:25,900
Hello?

521
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,470
Hello?

522
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:33,410
Fish?

523
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,610
Hello, fish?

524
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,290
Do I have bait?

525
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,610
Oh...

526
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,730
I might not have bait.

527
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,370
I think I have enough bait now.

528
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,030
How many did I get just now?

529
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,830
Why doesn't it tell me?

530
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,770
Where's my bait?

531
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,590
You can only have max five?

532
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,410
Oh, hello, game.

533
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:30,830
Press B.

534
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,970
Oh my god!

535
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,710
Why did it let me do so much?

536
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:37,950
Ha!

537
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,960
Three, two, one.

538
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,460
Mash, mash, mash.

539
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,640
You guys are so right.

540
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,180
Thank you.

541
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,880
I thought I had to press the whole time.

542
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,080
I got a small oyster.

543
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,140
Oyster?

544
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,740
I hardly know her.

545
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,800
Literal clickbait.

546
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,500
We're casting long and hard and wide and far.

547
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,900
We're casting far.

548
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,480
The spectral pole?

549
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,700
What's that?

550
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,880
What's the spectral pole?

551
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,420
I got a clownfish.

552
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,800
I ranked up!

553
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,420
I'm a scout again.

554
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,020
Need more.

555
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,090
Scout.

556
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,090
I'm a scout.

557
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,430
You can change your tag.

558
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,390
From scout to scout three.

559
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,470
Three.

560
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,440
Oh, I see.

561
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,920
I've been blocking the...

562
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,600
I'm blocking the... what's it called?

563
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,480
The bait, but I have three left.

564
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,320
I see it now.

565
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,200
Sorry, you guys couldn't see it.

566
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,600
Oh, you can kind of see it through my armpit.

567
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,380
Don't look at my armpit.

568
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,020
Minto, you are the same but different.

569
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,740
Yeah, I said I would be.

570
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,920
Oh my gosh, I've never had two before.

571
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,860
Oh my gosh.

572
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,860
Is this a rare fish?

573
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,140
This is the biggest fish?

574
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:47,840
This is the most...

575
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,660
I got a small swordfish!

576
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,600
Hi!

577
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Oh my gosh.

578
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,080
It said it was a quest.

579
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,400
It said it was a quest.

580
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:03,880
Hold on.

581
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,540
Let's go to the quest board.

582
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,140
How much does that sell for?

583
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,340
It sells for 24!

584
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,320
I'm one dollar off of a...

585
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,940
For a lottery ticket.

586
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,060
I...

587
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,060
Oh, whoopsie.

588
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,740
I don't quite know how I want to play this game yet.

589
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,300
Just because...

590
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,780
There's also the...

591
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
What the...

592
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,420
Oh, sorry.

593
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,280
I'm like clicking out of the game on accident.

594
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,200
Because I'm like dragging, you know?

595
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,560
I'm like dragging the camera and so I'm accidentally clicking out of my game.

596
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,180
There's like an aquarium too, isn't there?

597
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,160
I went inside some of the buildings before.

598
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,120
Oh, I died.

599
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,580
I died again.

600
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,580
Window jump scare?

601
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,600
Let's just take the bridge.

602
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,220
Like a normal person.

603
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,750
Is it...

604
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,710
Like, there's so many things in here, right?

605
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,410
There's so much you can do in here.

606
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,310
What do you mean I'm not a valid fish?

607
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,010
Is this a valid fish?

608
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,110
Insert.

609
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,580
Oh my gosh, he's in there!

610
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,980
Can I... Am I creating this fish?

611
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,320
Wait, no, no, no.

612
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:38,960
I don't want to...

613
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,060
Put the fish in there.

614
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,740
Why did I take him out?

615
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,060
Insert fish.

616
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:44,760
Okay.

617
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,540
Okay.

618
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,800
Now this.

619
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,420
Insert fish.

620
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,220
Wait.

621
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,940
No, no, don't retrieve!

622
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,980
No, no, no.

623
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,340
It's only one fish per person.

624
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,850
Huh?

625
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,450
One per player?

626
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,170
I thought I was filling up the aquarium.

627
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,770
Okay, we'll put our spine in there.

628
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,930
Let's go look at him.

629
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,590
Wow, little spine.

630
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,050
Oh, I thought this was like fill up the aquarium with all your fish.

631
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,030
Oh, little spine in the aquarium.

632
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,230
Wow.

633
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,730
What's this over here?

634
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,150
Just a box.

635
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,490
Oh my gosh.

636
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:49,690
I'm in it.

637
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,630
I'm in the box.

638
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,190
I'm also partially in the void.

639
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,130
And then there's this thing here.

640
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,030
The vending machine.

641
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,350
What do these do?

642
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,990
Literally just a beer.

643
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,170
Oh, we can get wine.

644
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,550
What's a shrink soda?

645
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,510
And a big soda?

646
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,270
And a water?

647
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,490
And a canned boost?

648
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,390
Wow.

649
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,070
What does the beer do?

650
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,250
Beer o'clock.

651
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,050
Don't go swimming with the beer guys.

652
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,230
Oh yeah.

653
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,070
Claim reward.

654
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,480
Oh my gosh.

655
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,320
We made a lot of money.

656
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,960
Scroll down for more.

657
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,080
What is this?

658
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,340
Alien cosmetic.

659
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,480
Special title cosmetic.

660
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,980
Five thousand dollars.

661
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,700
How many scratch tickets can we get with that?

662
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,800
Fill all journal entries in radiant quality.

663
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,260
What the hell does that even mean?

664
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,620
Oh, I have a new appearance.

665
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,260
I'm the strongest warrior.

666
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,120
Check the shop.

667
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,820
Is this the shop in here?

668
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,640
Hello?

669
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,620
Wow, he wears his fish.

670
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,820
I thought it was a beard.

671
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,320
Did he just purr at me?

672
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,680
Oh, cricket's bait.

673
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,540
Leech's bait.

674
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,220
Wow, these are expensive.

675
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,440
It's four hundred dollars per bait.

676
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,080
That's insane.

677
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,960
Rod luck.

678
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,880
Oh, I need that.

679
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,640
Camp tier.

680
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:03,480
Wait, so if I get two guys to come in here, can we get our camp tier to go even more high?

681
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,200
Oh, they're licenses.

682
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,120
The bait is cheap.

683
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,000
Oh, it's individual.

684
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,620
Oh my gosh.

685
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,300
Animate eyes.

686
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,410
Oh wait, these have...

687
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,630
They feel like some of these...

688
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,030
Some of these...

689
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,110
This one matches my freak retreat.

690
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,190
Unfortunately, the tooth for my cat is on the wrong side.

691
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,660
Bite slip.

692
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,920
Oh, we can get little hats and shirts and everything.

693
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,000
It's an MLM shirt?

694
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,460
But it's... Shouldn't it be MLF?

695
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:02,900
Right.

696
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,600
What?

697
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:16,350
I was thinking MLM like a... What's it called?

698
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,130
Like a pyramid scheme.

699
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,420
Is it not a pyramid scheme T-shirt?

700
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,400
I'm not sure anymore.

701
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,840
What's the other...

702
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:49,620
Men...

703
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:05,590
MLM, I thought he was gonna come to my house and sell me candles or cosmetics or something.

704
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,800
That's what I thought.

705
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:12,800
What?

706
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,460
Oh, we can get glasses.

707
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,900
Oh, we can get chalk.

708
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,540
Wait, can we draw and stuff?

709
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,200
Oh my gosh, stop.

710
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,460
We can get instruments.

711
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,800
We can really make this into Outer Wilds.

712
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,000
But right now, all I wanna do is buy gambles.

713
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,480
I wanna buy gambles.

714
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,380
Okay, I'm gonna go to... Wait, where's the gamble?

715
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,300
I'm gonna die!

716
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,880
I'm gonna go back to the gambling area.

717
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,480
And we're gonna...

718
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,440
And then I'll open it up.

719
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,820
You guys better just chill and let me gamble, okay?

720
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:04,900
I'm gonna die.

721
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,260
This way!

722
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,060
This way!

723
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:09,560
Okay.

724
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,780
Alright, just let me gamble.

725
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,960
Let me... Let me...

726
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,280
Let me give away my life savings, okay everybody?

727
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,700
No punching?

728
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:23,680
Yeah, no punching.

729
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,160
Oh, I thought that was a secret.

730
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,600
I'm kind of interested in more secrets too.

731
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,360
Woah!

732
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,020
Woah, woah.

733
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,800
This looks like an out of bounds.

734
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,200
Wait, this is kind of creepy.

735
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,080
Oh, it is out of bounds.

736
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,340
Wait, I can't go through here.

737
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,800
Why have it open then, huh?

738
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,170
Why is it even open if I can't go through?

739
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,730
Where's your bones?

740
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,730
Where's all your bones?

741
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:58,970
Where's all your bones?

742
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,110
Why are these areas so mysterious, huh?

743
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,310
Wait, this area has to be... No!

744
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,250
Come on, let me in!

745
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,910
The illusion of freedom.

746
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,850
This one won't even let me pass through.

747
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,070
Well, shoot.

748
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:26,690
Okay.

749
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,410
Back to...

750
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,700
I'm just looking for ghost bones.

751
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:37,860
Woah!

752
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,680
I'm just looking for ghost bones.

753
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,620
Let's take the shortcut.

754
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,640
Nice.

755
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,540
Easy peasy.

756
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,360
Alrighty.

757
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,030
I thought I heard ghost buns.

758
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:09,490
Give me a second.

759
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:18,790
Okay.

760
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,820
Okay.

761
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:29,080
I don't really have... I guess, don't...

762
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,920
You know, don't overstay your welcome.

763
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,940
I won't be using the chat in the game.

764
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,120
Be nice.

765
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,120
And, you know, so...

766
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,960
Stay, you know, you can stay for like 10 minutes or something.

767
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,740
And then leave, you know, 5-10 minutes.

768
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,920
Just so that people can have a chance to join as well and stuff.

769
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,260
So yeah.

770
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,780
Code will be shared under memberships.

771
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,320
This is a web fishing room color.

772
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,900
And I'm posting it 3, 2, 1, now!

773
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,430
And now I'm going to go fish for more stuff.

774
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,890
Oh, here we go.

775
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:23,950
Supercharge!

776
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,810
All I want to do is gamble.

777
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,100
Welcome to membership.

778
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:36,900
Thank you!

779
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,760
Yeah, hopefully the server doesn't crash.

780
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,440
I guess we'll see.

781
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,420
I guess we'll see.

782
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,880
We are just fishing.

783
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,540
It says the room doesn't exist.

784
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,150
What did I just...Oh gosh!

785
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,790
I think the room exists.

786
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,190
Wait, I hear something.

787
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:12,510
I hear something.

788
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,230
I hear something.

789
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,510
Something is in my...

790
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,730
Hold, hold, hold!

791
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,390
Oh my god.

792
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:30,110
I can't see.

793
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,330
I don't even know what I caught.

794
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,290
I caught a large krill.

795
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:34,990
I'm going to krill myself.

796
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,230
I can't even see what it is.

797
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:38,670
Get out of my way!

798
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:38,890
Get out!

799
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,010
Fish.

800
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,830
Look at everybody fishing.

801
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,690
Oh my gosh.

802
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,790
Are you crying?

803
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:03,990
What is this one?

804
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:05,690
Oh my gosh!

805
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:06,130
Eleven!

806
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:06,670
Oh my god.

807
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,570
Wait, you guys, I think I got something kind of rare!

808
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,290
You guys, I think I got something kind of rare!

809
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,490
What did I get?

810
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,750
I got a dogfish.

811
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:20,930
What the hell?

812
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:24,410
What's going on?

813
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:26,830
What is that?

814
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,780
Oh my god.

815
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,560
How are you guys getting such big things?

816
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,040
How did you set up a picnic?

817
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,140
What is going on?

818
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:44,160
No way, I thought a mountain had spawned in front of us.

819
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,600
Oh my gosh, the title caught the super duper rare.

820
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,680
Rare golden bass.

821
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,620
Oh my gosh.

822
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,560
They have better gear than me?

823
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,500
I just started.

824
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,600
I'm still a scout, you guys.

825
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,380
I'm still...

826
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,440
I'm a scout.

827
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,300
I'm a scout.

828
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,420
Oh wait.

829
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,440
I think I don't have any more bait.

830
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,040
I don't have any bait.

831
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:21,660
Lesson?

832
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:22,840
Hot dog.

833
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:23,480
Gotcha.

834
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,100
Nope, you fail.

835
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,320
Oh, I can only get five, that's right.

836
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,360
I got a krill!

837
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,840
He's actually kind of expensive.

838
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,380
Thanks.

839
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:33,960
You're welcome.

840
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,420
Oyster.

841
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,840
I want to save my big guys, you know.

842
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,060
Alright, hold on.

843
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,880
Alright, guys.

844
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,740
I'll be able to afford the good stuff too once I make a lot of money from my scratch-offs, okay?

845
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,560
Alright, scratch-off time.

846
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:56,820
Scratch-off time.

847
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,760
Me and Robot are scratching off.

848
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,260
Here we go.

849
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,580
Here we go.

850
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,440
Try is $500.

851
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,000
It's telling me to try again.

852
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,240
It's telling me to try again.

853
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,680
It's telling me to try again.

854
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:16,310
I could win.

855
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:17,970
Is that okay?

856
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:21,710
Why is it called fishillionaire when you can only win up to $10,000?

857
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,970
Isn't that kind of messed up?

858
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,630
It's my angry cries.

859
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:31,810
What the hell?

860
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,480
I'm just trying to live my life and someone is punching me in the face.

861
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,000
What a krill.

862
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,700
Okay, this is the one.

863
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,360
Oh my gosh!

864
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,180
Stop you guys!

865
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,280
We won $100!

866
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,360
You need a new vacuum?

867
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,100
What do you mean do I need a new vacuum?

868
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,060
We got $100!

869
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:04,380
$100!

870
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,540
These eyes are freaking me out.

871
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,600
What is this smile?

872
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,000
Wait!

873
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,920
How much did you win?

874
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,060
How much did you win?

875
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,200
How much did you win?

876
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,620
How much did you win?

877
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,480
They just ran away.

878
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,050
How much did they win?

879
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:34,850
Oh, Ripperoni.

880
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:40,310
Alright, this is the big box.

881
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:42,070
This is the big box.

882
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,670
This is the big box.

883
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,790
This is the big box!

884
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:46,770
Who

885
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:04,000
just went to the bathroom on my stream?

886
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:11,490
What's going on?

887
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:12,850
I'm leaving this area.

888
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,430
Wait a second.

889
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,590
Oh my gosh, your hat matches mine.

890
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:18,090
How is that possible?

891
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,970
Eddie has half the same hat as me.

892
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,260
$500!

893
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,420
If only...

894
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,240
Okay.

895
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,340
Okay.

896
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:33,640
Alright.

897
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,970
Back to...

898
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,280
This is... Stop flushing the toilet in my right ear!

899
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,500
I hate this.

900
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,420
This is such a mistake.

901
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,060
Get out of my frame!

902
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,680
You're blocking my shot.

903
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,040
I can't see anything.

904
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,180
Oh my god.

905
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,120
Oh my god.

906
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,300
Where is my fish?

907
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,660
You guys are taking all my fish.

908
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,920
You guys are taking all my fish.

909
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,860
You can zoom out.

910
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,560
I got a fish.

911
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,020
I got a fish.

912
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,520
I'm holding.

913
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,160
I'm holding.

914
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,620
I'm holding.

915
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,200
I got a large.

916
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,680
I was about to say a little.

917
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,160
He is a little herring.

918
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,080
Oh my gosh, you guys.

919
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,180
I'm almost at rank 3.

920
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,020
Good eye.

921
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,200
Welcome to my bush of barbecue.

922
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,800
Oh my gosh.

923
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,540
Splash, splash, splash.

924
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,920
You guys, I got something rare.

925
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,860
I got something rare.

926
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,720
I got something good.

927
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,520
Who the hell is farting over there?

928
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,320
Another dogfish.

929
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,680
Get out of my face.

930
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,400
I ranked up.

931
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,140
What the... Did I spawn that?

932
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,120
Oh, I can fish in it too.

933
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:52,980
What is this?

934
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,240
Why is there a tiny frog fishing right here?

935
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,280
What is this chaos?

936
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,980
What is happening?

937
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,480
I'm fishing in the well.

938
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,520
I'm now back.

939
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,180
Oh my gosh.

940
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:12,720
Oh my gosh.

941
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,700
I caught something.

942
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,300
I caught something.

943
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,240
It better be something cool.

944
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,580
It better be something good.

945
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,040
I caught... a huge snail.

946
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:30,800
Look

947
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:38,130
at this guy just walking around with his stingray out.

948
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,580
Who is barking over there?

949
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,440
What the...

950
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,280
Oh my god!

951
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,960
That's what was farting.

952
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,480
It's a whoopee cushion.

953
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:56,740
Wait, hold on.

954
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:03,230
Hold on.

955
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,090
Oh, I missed.

956
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:04,510
Hold on.

957
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:09,010
Wait.

958
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,750
You can buy the hat you are wearing right now in game too.

959
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,050
It's the fear hat in the hub shop.

960
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:23,440
Why?

961
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,660
I'm gonna go buy it.

962
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:29,720
Wait, so is the... I guess there is not really a point to...

963
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,380
Saving fish, huh?

964
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,640
The point of this game is to really sell the fish.

965
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,720
I thought that you would save them too for the...

966
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,200
For the...

967
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,300
What's the word?

968
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:46,860
Hello.

969
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,470
You can save cool ones, but sell most.

970
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:55,750
Wait, it's this lady.

971
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,800
Fear hat.

972
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,380
I can't believe it.

973
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,980
That this actually is not just the women want me, fish fear me hat.

974
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,540
It's the exact same hat that I'm wearing.

975
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,240
I can't believe that it's actually the same thing.

976
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,440
That's so funny.

977
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,620
Oh my gosh.

978
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,160
The game got way too immersive.

979
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,860
That's so funny.

980
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,280
I'm gonna do in the pond a little bit.

981
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:05,800
Why are you staring at me like that with your sparkly eyes?

982
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,860
Why are you looking at me like this?

983
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,120
I got murdered!

984
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,440
Oh my God, I literally...

985
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,360
Hold on, I'm trying to fish.

986
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,100
I just got murdered by a sparkly dog.

987
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,300
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

988
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,260
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

989
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,100
Wait, how did you manage to get on that rock like that?

990
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,070
I got a crayfish.

991
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:52,650
What the hell is going on here?

992
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,010
What is this graffiti on my ground?

993
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:57,590
In my camp...

994
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,590
How is this graffiti?

995
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,470
Can I fish in this thing?

996
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:04,390
Wait, interact.

997
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,910
This buddy isn't yours.

998
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,110
I can't fish in him.

999
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,030
Can I fish in the buddy?

1000
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,720
Yeah, we got vandalism going on.

1001
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,740
Whoops, I didn't mean to do that.

1002
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,800
Wait, get me out.

1003
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,680
What is that?

1004
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,020
What is that?

1005
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:38,210
What the hell is going on?

1006
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:40,550
What is this?

1007
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:44,490
Oh my God, they're giant fish!

1008
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,150
I died.

1009
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:49,330
Oh my gosh.

1010
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,510
How do I make this?

1011
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,650
Oh gosh, I can't even see anymore.

1012
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:55,970
What's happening?

1013
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,040
I have to jump up to see it.

1014
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,520
Oh no, I'm gonna die.

1015
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,020
Why are there so many fish that are so big?

1016
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,260
What the hell is this one?

1017
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,420
This is just a green screen fish.

1018
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,720
Oh, it's not a fish at all.

1019
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:21,940
It's a green screen.

1020
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,400
Green screen fish.

1021
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,140
Hey, let me in the picture.

1022
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:44,520
I like woe-hoed snake right here.

1023
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,880
The dogs are too loud!

1024
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:54,500
Shut up!

1025
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,480
The dogs are annoying.

1026
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,460
Shut up, dogs.

1027
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,500
Shut up, dogs.

1028
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:07,350
I hear a lone bark in the distance.

1029
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:09,990
Oh wait, I need more bait.

1030
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,190
Why did people just set up the little buddies?

1031
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:16,030
What are those things?

1032
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:18,690
What are those little buddies?

1033
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,790
Wait, this dogfish is worth more than this dogfish.

1034
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:25,610
Is it the size?

1035
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:29,810
How do I punch people?

1036
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,410
How do you punch?

1037
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:38,510
Size matters.

1038
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:42,850
Need boxing gloves.

1039
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:45,990
You have to buy the punch item.

1040
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:47,010
That's so funny.

1041
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,650
That's so funny sounding.

1042
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,640
Excuse me.

1043
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,040
Ruff.

1044
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,040
Stop, your fish is right near little... Is that a frog?

1045
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:09,960
What is that anyway?

1046
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,880
I don't even know what that is.

1047
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,280
Oh, they are dying.

1048
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,400
They are dying in the water.

1049
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,240
I kind of want to use that chair.

1050
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:31,820
I kind of want to use that chair.

1051
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,300
Yeah, everybody is scaring the fish away.

1052
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,660
Get out of the water!

1053
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:38,880
You are scaring the fish away.

1054
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,460
Oh my gosh, the rubber ducky is so cute.

1055
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,520
My oshi frog bird.

1056
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:51,780
Nah, frog birds got way more style and class.

1057
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:53,480
I think.

1058
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,300
I think actually.

1059
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,360
They are scaring the fish.

1060
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,420
I'm gonna go over here.

1061
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:17,310
What?

1062
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:20,970
Stay over there.

1063
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:22,110
Stop it!

1064
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,030
It's scaring the fish!

1065
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,570
How did you live?

1066
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,730
Did you just come up and...

1067
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,650
It was a run away.

1068
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:02,680
I can't with this.

1069
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,060
I can't with this lobby.

1070
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,520
It was a drive-by kiss.

1071
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,220
I can't believe that happened to me.

1072
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,900
Yeah, I'm calling the cops.

1073
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,100
I'm reporting you to the police at this very moment.

1074
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,620
I regret nothing.

1075
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,860
Oh my gosh.

1076
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,080
How are you so fast over there?

1077
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,620
Did you drink the soda?

1078
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,380
The speedy soda?

1079
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,080
I got another large hairy.

1080
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,560
Okay, I need to start saving up money.

1081
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,200
So that we can get stuff for better things.

1082
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,120
What is going on?

1083
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,160
That guy is eating dirt?

1084
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,720
Just wisp things?

1085
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,960
I got a krill.

1086
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,620
I keep getting the same things now.

1087
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,880
Better things equals more lottery tickets.

1088
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,620
Oh gosh, that scared me.

1089
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,620
Get your whale out of my face.

1090
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,220
Guys, this is a big one!

1091
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,420
Guys, this is a big one.

1092
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,980
This might be my own whale!

1093
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,820
My own movie dick!

1094
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,800
Oh my god, please.

1095
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,320
I got an octopus!

1096
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:30,660
Octopus!

1097
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,060
I thought wisps had claws.

1098
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:35,020
Stop!

1099
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,840
I'll kill you.

1100
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,840
Wait, how do I show off my fish?

1101
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,340
Everybody look at my octopus.

1102
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,840
Everybody look at my octopus.

1103
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,400
It's the best thing I've caught all day.

1104
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:53,780
Look at it.

1105
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,380
Look at it.

1106
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,600
Look at it.

1107
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,860
Look at it.

1108
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,200
Yeah, look at it.

1109
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,340
Don't punch.

1110
01:08:59,460 --> 01:08:59,880
Don't punch.

1111
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,460
Look at my octopus.

1112
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:05,180
I don't care about your damn fish.

1113
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,800
Yes, thank you.

1114
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,160
Thank you.

1115
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,360
Look at my octopus.

1116
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:14,460
Next song?

1117
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,220
Wait, what?

1118
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,820
What do you mean next song?

1119
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,900
Oh, it's a beatbox.

1120
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:21,960
Wait, hold on.

1121
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:22,880
I want to listen.

1122
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,000
I want to listen.

1123
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,260
I want to listen.

1124
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:27,920
Hey, stop, stop, stop.

1125
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,530
Where is the music?

1126
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:37,050
Next song.

1127
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,070
This song is terrible.

1128
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,010
Oh, I didn't save the settings?

1129
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:09,270
I didn't save the settings.

1130
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:11,850
There we go.

1131
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,540
I thought it was just...

1132
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,140
Wait,

1133
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,220
there are two songs going at once.

1134
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:27,540
Please.

1135
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,180
I heart peeing.

1136
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,460
I hope that's not what you're doing.

1137
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,020
Oh, here we go.

1138
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:08,420
Okay.

1139
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,220
Can I meow to this song?

1140
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,220
Okay.

1141
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:43,980
That was great.

1142
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:45,500
That was good fun.

1143
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:47,960
That was good fun.

1144
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,480
How do I put away my octopus?

1145
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:51,680
Octopus.

1146
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,100
How do I put him away?

1147
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:58,320
How do I put this guy away?

1148
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,740
I have a letter?

1149
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,700
I'm not checking letters on stream.

1150
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:08,800
Because I'm nervous about stuff.

1151
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,040
Switch to anything else?

1152
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,700
Okay, I'll switch to my spine.

1153
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:14,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

1154
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,160
This is my spectral rib.

1155
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,360
Everybody look at my rib.

1156
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:18,180
Everybody.

1157
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:21,040
Everybody look at...this is a piece of me.

1158
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,860
Wait, what is your fishing rod?

1159
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,780
Wait, what is this?

1160
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,440
What does that mean?

1161
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,760
Is this a ghost rod?

1162
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,220
Find the rest of the bones.

1163
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:48,340
Guys, we must find the bones.

1164
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:49,280
Wait, hold on.

1165
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:49,880
I want to go take...

1166
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:53,960
Okay.

1167
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,020
We must find the rest of the bones.

1168
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,200
Right now.

1169
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,080
Who wants to take a picture of me?

1170
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,280
Hey, get out of my face.

1171
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,060
Get out of my shot.

1172
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,600
Picture, picture, picture.

1173
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,520
We must find the rest of the bones.

1174
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,560
Oh, I died.

1175
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:40,700
Hold on.

1176
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:41,280
This way.

1177
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,900
This seems like a bone area.

1178
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,880
This area looks a little bony.

1179
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:46,800
Boned.

1180
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,180
Boned area.

1181
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:48,940
Maybe.

1182
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,500
Octopi are extremely intelligent and one day will rule the land.

1183
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:05,250
A bone zone, if you will.

1184
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:05,650
Yes.

1185
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:07,890
So we got the one.

1186
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,190
We got this one and we got the other one.

1187
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,410
Can I get a hint?

1188
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:13,810
Does anybody else know?

1189
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:17,130
Can I get a hint of one?

1190
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:19,750
How many are there?

1191
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:20,670
I don't even know.

1192
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:24,290
They are high up.

1193
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:29,010
Ocean.

1194
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:30,550
Total of five.

1195
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,950
Okay.

1196
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,070
Oh, excuse me.

1197
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:38,350
High up, like in the trees.

1198
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,340
Thank you for existing.

1199
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,700
Thank you.

1200
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,620
Thanks for one month of membership.

1201
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,700
Somebody needs a bounce pad.

1202
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,440
Like the bounce shrooms?

1203
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:04,910
What is this drawing?

1204
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:08,410
What the?

1205
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:13,750
Oh my gosh.

1206
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:16,530
God.

1207
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:25,130
It's so cute.

1208
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:27,810
Who did this?

1209
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:30,970
Smelly, smelly, smelly.

1210
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:37,870
I'm doing taco.

1211
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:39,770
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

1212
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:48,210
Let's see.

1213
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:51,150
Ocean.

1214
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,020
And then somewhere high up.

1215
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:05,530
Maybe like this one.

1216
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:08,590
I got that one over there.

1217
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:09,410
I know that.

1218
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:14,990
Let's see if we can get a vantage point.

1219
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:17,150
I see this guy everywhere.

1220
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:23,930
I think if you've been here from the beginning, it might be time to...

1221
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:26,030
Switch out so other people can join.

1222
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,490
So thank you for coming in.

1223
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:34,390
We're just going on honor system here, so please be honorable.

1224
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:40,790
Let's see.

1225
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,720
Maybe over here, but I just missed it.

1226
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:49,380
Oh shoot.

1227
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:06,450
Art style reminds me of a short hike.

1228
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:09,510
I can see that.

1229
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:10,210
Letter received.

1230
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:10,930
Thank you!

1231
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:12,710
If you're sending letters, I will check them.

1232
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:15,610
I will check them off stream.

1233
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:17,510
I got...

1234
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,310
I got a spectral skull!

1235
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:21,650
Yippee!

1236
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:25,850
Ok, that's three.

1237
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,280
Thanks for the letters.

1238
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:41,930
How do I get...You guys both have ghost rods.

1239
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:43,830
I'm jealous.

1240
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:47,230
I'm jealous.

1241
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:48,890
I'm jealous.

1242
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:50,370
I want one.

1243
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:52,550
I have a normal rod.

1244
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:57,510
Two more.

1245
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,300
This will be my lucky time.

1246
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:06,920
Right now.

1247
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:08,680
Luck, luck, luck, luck.

1248
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:17,500
I mean, I might as well just...Wow, it's zero and zero.

1249
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,540
Oh wait, I just noticed.

1250
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,360
Three, seven.

1251
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,420
I just noticed that.

1252
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,900
Oh, nineteen, twelve.

1253
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:34,860
Oh my god, stop.

1254
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,920
I thought it had to match the number and then also the letters down here.

1255
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:42,560
I was like, wow, this is tough.

1256
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:46,120
It's not about the type of rod you have, but how you use that matters.

1257
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:48,500
Yeah, I know, but...

1258
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,260
I want a ghost rod.

1259
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,560
I hate this game.

1260
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,800
Okay, so we found that one.

1261
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,640
This game is rigged.

1262
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,700
Let this be a warning for you all.

1263
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,500
I'm gonna die.

1264
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:25,840
I lived.

1265
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,120
I lived!

1266
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,640
So we have...

1267
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,500
Oh, I think I need to go get the spine back from the...

1268
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,000
From the aquarium probably, huh?

1269
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,380
What is this side- Why are you side-eyeing me for, huh?

1270
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,060
Why is this so rude?

1271
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:47,180
Rude.

1272
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,720
Side-eyeing me for, huh?

1273
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,980
How is it going?

1274
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,080
It's going fine.

1275
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:59,380
If Min uses the ghost rod, she gets STFB.

1276
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,680
Same type fishing bonus.

1277
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,600
Oh my god.

1278
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,320
Wait, can I take my fish back?

1279
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:07,760
Okay.

1280
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,460
I got my fish from the...

1281
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:15,240
This is so stupid.

1282
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,580
They don't even move.

1283
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,260
They don't even move.

1284
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,220
They just sit there.

1285
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:38,260
Oh, this is... The tank is not even big enough for them.

1286
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,420
This is so sad.

1287
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:41,300
I don't even know what that is.

1288
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,020
This is so cute.

1289
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:44,820
Hello, hello.

1290
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,520
Oh, I made it.

1291
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,960
Look at you fishing over there.

1292
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:56,780
How wholesome.

1293
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,620
How wholesome.

1294
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:02,580
Oh, I did something.

1295
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,820
I caught an octopus, so I get 25 dollars.

1296
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,320
Catch a lake fish.

1297
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,120
Catch a 9 out of 10 ocean fish.

1298
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,520
I don't even know if the spectral one is any good.

1299
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,660
You know, the spectral rod.

1300
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:34,820
It's cosmetic.

1301
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,020
I guess that's okay.

1302
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:42,340
You know, whatever.

1303
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,720
But I have to use it.

1304
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:45,780
Yeah, it's the ghost rod.

1305
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:47,260
I have to use it.

1306
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,620
It's literally made for me.

1307
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,420
Can I get another hint?

1308
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,580
Maybe this one is the hint.

1309
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,280
There is one nearby the lighthouse.

1310
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,740
I got that one.

1311
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,300
Or is there another one by the lighthouse?

1312
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:18,010
There is another.

1313
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,370
And I'm also close to one.

1314
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,030
Oh gosh, wait, I clicked out of the game.

1315
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:29,170
Hello, I'm looking for bones.

1316
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:32,990
Do you know where the bones are?

1317
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:33,470
Wait!

1318
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:34,870
How did you get that bone?

1319
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:35,770
Where is it?

1320
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,470
Wait, how did you get out there?

1321
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:50,150
He disappeared.

1322
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,470
Wait, he disappeared!

1323
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,820
Oh hello!

1324
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:09,660
Okay, I'm watching.

1325
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,220
I'm watching.

1326
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,380
Wait, are you leading me still?

1327
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,190
I'm watching.

1328
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:19,690
I'm watching.

1329
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:20,270
I'm following.

1330
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:20,810
I'm following.

1331
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:25,330
I hope this isn't a trap.

1332
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:29,630
Thank you!

1333
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:33,030
We got the femur!

1334
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:35,170
Thank you!

1335
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,370
Thank you, thank you!

1336
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:42,090
Alright, now we go to the lighthouse and then go find that one.

1337
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:45,570
One more!

1338
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:51,170
That one was hidden so well.

1339
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:55,510
That one was like really...

1340
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,650
I don't think I would have been able to find it very easily.

1341
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:08,810
Of all the places to land, just immediate death.

1342
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,450
Okay, by the lighthouse.

1343
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,400
By the lighthouse.

1344
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,900
I can't tell if he wants me to follow him.

1345
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:31,500
I want to find this one myself.

1346
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,780
I want to find this one myself.

1347
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,720
No help.

1348
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,740
No help this time.

1349
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:46,820
No help.

1350
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,260
What we have learned here is that our Oshi will just follow random strangers.

1351
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,960
By the lighthouse.

1352
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,760
Did you guys watch the...

1353
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,500
The... Okay, so I got that one over there.

1354
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:14,500
Did you guys watch the over the garden wall...

1355
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,720
Short that was made?

1356
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,860
Not yet?

1357
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:26,800
It's really short.

1358
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:28,560
But it's so cute.

1359
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,080
It's really sweet.

1360
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:34,200
I'm looking into the trees from above.

1361
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:46,700
I'm not seeing anything.

1362
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,620
I was hoping you'd bring it up.

1363
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,040
Yeah, it was so cute.

1364
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,820
It's just a...

1365
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:58,140
It's like a stop animation short thing.

1366
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:03,340
If I were bones, where would I be hidden?

1367
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,940
The bone zone.

1368
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,220
Saying the last one is near the lighthouse might be misleading.

1369
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,900
Is it just in this general vicinity then?

1370
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:25,570
I have four of them.

1371
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:26,550
So this is the last one.

1372
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,020
I did the parkour.

1373
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,180
What did I just hear?

1374
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:38,720
Sounded like a music.

1375
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,450
What's that sound?

1376
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:52,590
Oh, it's a guitar.

1377
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:52,670
A guitar.

1378
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,410
An interpretive dance.

1379
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:22,430
Play Wonderwall.

1380
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:34,350
He's like, I don't know how to play that one.

1381
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,120
How are you so small?

1382
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,400
Small cat.

1383
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:47,860
Hey!

1384
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:48,660
Hey!

1385
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:49,880
Hey!

1386
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:53,140
I'm gonna go buy things too.

1387
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,460
How do I buy a boxing glove?

1388
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,340
Oh, I need to unlock my camp tier.

1389
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:02,220
Maybe.

1390
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,280
Oh wait.

1391
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:07,700
Oh wait!

1392
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:08,900
No, I don't!

1393
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,240
I can... Oh gosh.

1394
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,720
Cannot afford.

1395
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:12,780
Cannot afford.

1396
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:15,540
Jeez.

1397
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:16,240
Oh boy.

1398
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,260
Oh wait, I can buy titles.

1399
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,040
Silly guy.

1400
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:22,420
Just a silly little guy.

1401
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:23,820
Little lad.

1402
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:24,700
I'm a little guy.

1403
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,800
Oh, sloppy doggy style.

1404
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,440
Stinker dinker.

1405
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,260
I'm just gonna buy the gay title.

1406
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,960
I kinda want the good boy.

1407
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,780
Kitten title.

1408
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,420
Goober title.

1409
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:51,560
Yapper title.

1410
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:57,300
Chalks are fun.

1411
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,720
The discord kitten title.

1412
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:05,340
How do I get an eyepatch?

1413
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,640
I want an eyepatch too.

1414
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,280
How do I get an eyepatch?

1415
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:16,080
Do I have to actually rank up my title?

1416
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:19,380
Or rank up my...thing?

1417
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:20,800
I have to level up?

1418
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:29,880
I bought the boxing glove.

1419
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,120
But don't tell him.

1420
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:40,730
How did you get in here?

1421
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:43,150
I thought this was a private location.

1422
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,900
Am I doing it right?

1423
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,880
I can't beat anybody.

1424
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,220
I can't beat him up.

1425
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,040
Oh my god.

1426
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,300
Fight club.

1427
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,540
How do I push you into the air?

1428
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,540
Wait, line up, line up, line up, line up.

1429
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,800
Get in a line, get in a line, get in a line.

1430
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,660
Get in a line, get in a line, get in a line.

1431
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:31,160
No cutting!

1432
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:35,700
Alright, go to the end of the line.

1433
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,620
Go to the end of the line.

1434
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,380
Okay, whatever, that works too.

1435
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,860
Alright, when I punch you, go to the end of the line.

1436
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,780
How do you make me go so far though?

1437
01:30:57,630 --> 01:30:59,950
Don't look at me with that creepy-ass smile.

1438
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:01,050
What the hell is this?

1439
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:03,630
Stop it!

1440
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:06,470
Thanks for that boss.

1441
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:09,810
Group punch everybody!

1442
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,010
Group punch!

1443
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:12,230
Group punch!

1444
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:22,250
Oh my god, the whoopee cushion scared me.

1445
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:26,290
I'm going to fish in this toilet.

1446
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:37,410
Hey, this is my toilet.

1447
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:38,550
Get out, get out, get out.

1448
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:41,070
New meet and greet meta?

1449
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:41,950
Probably.

1450
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:46,590
Nice punchline boss.

1451
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:47,350
Thank you, Zeno.

1452
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,710
Hey, you took my fish!

1453
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:51,230
How did you get that?

1454
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:58,470
This is the one, three, two, kiss me slap line.

1455
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:01,770
Wait, why don't I get any fish?

1456
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:06,050
Where is my fish?

1457
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:11,630
Hello?

1458
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:12,070
Hello?

1459
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:14,290
How are you guys...Oh, I got one finally.

1460
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:22,830
Fishing in the skippity toilet.

1461
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:24,090
I wish you didn't say that.

1462
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:26,350
I got a goldfish.

1463
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:27,270
That's kind of messed up.

1464
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:31,030
Getting a goldfish from...Oh my gosh, I'm so close to ranking up.

1465
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:34,890
Getting a goldfish from a toilet is so sad, is it not?

1466
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:39,450
I wish you didn't read that.

1467
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:44,150
Staff morale increase.

1468
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:46,210
Thanks for that sir.

1469
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,390
Thanks for that boss.

1470
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,870
I got a salmon.

1471
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:53,010
Yay!

1472
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:54,630
I reached rank five!

1473
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,730
I probably saved it.

1474
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:07,870
I remember I once got a betta fish from the fair.

1475
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:13,810
And I loved him so much, I fed him non-stop.

1476
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:17,110
I was like, here's some more food.

1477
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:18,670
And he'd be like...

1478
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:20,490
And I'd be like, ah, he likes food.

1479
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:21,290
Here's some more food.

1480
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:22,430
And he'd go...

1481
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:24,230
And I'd be like, ah, here's some more food.

1482
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,550
And he'd go...

1483
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:27,050
And...

1484
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:32,130
I actually thought I was gonna kill him.

1485
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,170
But he survived for a couple of years.

1486
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,390
A bow fin.

1487
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:43,310
Alright, let's go find that other bone.

1488
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:46,730
Rain's coming in.

1489
01:33:46,850 --> 01:33:47,670
Wait, what's that do?

1490
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:49,110
Does it make betta fish?

1491
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:54,590
Does betta fish come out in the rain?

1492
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:57,750
Yes?

1493
01:33:57,870 --> 01:33:58,570
Okay, okay.

1494
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,810
Nevermind, we're fishing boys, we're fishing.

1495
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:03,070
Do you want help with the bone?

1496
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:10,090
Maybe a hint.

1497
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:11,550
A tiny hint.

1498
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,110
I got the same thing.

1499
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:19,290
Come on, we want the good fish.

1500
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,930
Follow the sound of the incessant barking.

1501
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:29,930
No, I don't want someone to lead me.

1502
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:32,290
It's on the island.

1503
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:33,370
Corner.

1504
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:34,870
Hint is corner.

1505
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:40,670
Where's the good fish?

1506
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,100
Where's the good fish?

1507
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,600
Oh, I caught a branch?

1508
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,400
That's not even a fish.

1509
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,600
I didn't even get a fish, I got a stick.

1510
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:09,580
I didn't even get a... What?

1511
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,600
I thought the good fish was supposed to come out.

1512
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:26,480
Instead I get... Oh, oh my god.

1513
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:27,780
Hi baby.

1514
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:32,360
Stop meowing, I thought you were my cat, but my cat is actually meowing at me.

1515
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:33,460
What's up baby girl?

1516
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,440
Hey girl, stop meowing.

1517
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:39,380
I'm trying to hear my cat, my own cat meowing.

1518
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:41,820
Come here baby girl.

1519
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,760
Come here girl.

1520
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,200
It's paused.

1521
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,200
I keep... She wants out, but...

1522
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:06,840
What do you want girl?

1523
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:07,840
I know you want out.

1524
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:08,460
Hold on.

1525
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,140
Let me catch a fish first.

1526
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,660
Stop catching my fish!

1527
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:12,880
What's up with this?

1528
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:17,000
You keep putting it in the same spot as me and you're catching all my fish.

1529
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,460
Stop being so rude.

1530
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:33,130
I'll kick you from this lobby.

1531
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:35,790
Oh, I don't have bait.

1532
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:41,290
I don't have bait.

1533
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:43,610
Wait, where can I get some?

1534
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:47,750
Oh wait, it's still raining, kind of.

1535
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,620
I need a bait.

1536
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:03,850
Come here little girl.

1537
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:05,950
Nevermind, hold on girly.

1538
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:06,910
Oh, my bad.

1539
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:11,110
It's time to fish.

1540
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:15,370
I got a...

1541
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:17,250
Another goldfish.

1542
01:37:17,530 --> 01:37:18,710
Is it because I'm by the toilet?

1543
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:19,910
Oh my god.

1544
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:34,880
Oh,

1545
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,380
I got a rainbow trout.

1546
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,220
Okay, hold on.

1547
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,320
Let me...

1548
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:53,940
Girl, come here baby.

1549
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:55,780
You are so small.

1550
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:57,640
You are so cute.

1551
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,380
My cute little girl.

1552
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,560
Maybe she'll meow for you guys.

1553
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:02,900
Hold on.

1554
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,880
Let me turn off... Oh, no, no, no.

1555
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:07,020
Let me turn off the music.

1556
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:10,760
And let me turn off my noise gate.

1557
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:13,760
Come here Pais.

1558
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:27,790
You guys hear her?

1559
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:29,090
It's probably hard to hear.

1560
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:31,190
Oh, the BGM.

1561
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:32,410
Sorry.

1562
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:36,890
Do you hear her?

1563
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:39,630
Yeah?

1564
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:42,130
You are so sweet baby girl.

1565
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,090
You are so sweet.

1566
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:44,970
You are so sweet.

1567
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:47,870
Yeah, you...

1568
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:52,110
I don't want to put my finger in your ear.

1569
01:38:54,230 --> 01:38:54,970
Come here.

1570
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:58,010
Do you hear her?

1571
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:00,690
Oh, she's flopping on the ground.

1572
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:01,990
Stop it.

1573
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:04,330
Those are the postcards.

1574
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:09,010
Those are the Patreon postcards.

1575
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:12,610
Come here.

1576
01:39:13,630 --> 01:39:14,190
Come here.

1577
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:17,670
Yeah, she's a squeaker.

1578
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:20,150
She's super squeaky.

1579
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:23,970
Come here.

1580
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:25,610
Come here.

1581
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:26,850
Come here.

1582
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:28,170
Come here.

1583
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:31,730
She's rolling all over the place.

1584
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:32,570
Come here.

1585
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:33,690
Come here.

1586
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:34,410
Come here.

1587
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:35,450
Over

1588
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:41,470
here.

1589
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:43,910
Just one last squeak.

1590
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:44,950
One last squeak.

1591
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:56,460
Come over here.

1592
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:00,910
I'm sorry guys.

1593
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:02,050
I'm trying to get her to squeak.

1594
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:02,710
One last squeak.

1595
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,740
Stop licking yourself.

1596
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:15,070
Come here.

1597
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:16,270
Come here.

1598
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:21,870
You are so sweet.

1599
01:40:22,270 --> 01:40:25,330
I love

1600
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:29,510
you.

1601
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:34,240
Okay, I let her out.

1602
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,420
Sorry, I couldn't get the last one squeak out of her.

1603
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:45,150
What was it at?

1604
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:45,750
Like 75?

1605
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:46,230
Whatever.

1606
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:17,530
Okay.

1607
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:20,530
Okey dokey.

1608
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:22,430
Alright, let's find a bone.

1609
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:26,210
Corner was the hint.

1610
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:26,870
Corner.

1611
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:29,590
Corner of the world?

1612
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:31,430
Corner of the beach?

1613
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:34,210
Let's see.

1614
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:36,850
Thank you for the blessed pies noises.

1615
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:37,630
Of course.

1616
01:41:38,370 --> 01:41:39,130
Under here?

1617
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:42,150
Oh gosh, I'm stuck now.

1618
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:44,490
Around here, no?

1619
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,610
Corner, corner, corner.

1620
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:49,890
I just got here with a nice hat.

1621
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:50,770
Thanks my girl.

1622
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:54,530
Did you see the new Over the Garden Wall stop motion short?

1623
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:55,130
I did!

1624
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:59,130
My only thing is I wish it were longer.

1625
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:01,810
But it made me tear up.

1626
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:03,910
Oh my gosh, the other day I watched the concert.

1627
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:06,170
They did a concert on Twitch.

1628
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:10,570
And it was so...

1629
01:42:10,570 --> 01:42:11,370
Beautiful.

1630
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:14,570
It was funny because it was also very like...

1631
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:16,510
Wait, wrong way?

1632
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:18,170
What do you mean wrong way?

1633
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:31,790
It was just so...

1634
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,140
Can you reach that?

1635
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:42,340
Can you reach that?

1636
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:44,960
Even Elijah Wood showed up.

1637
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:45,940
Oh shoot.

1638
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:53,480
It was like at some tiny little...

1639
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:54,760
I say tiny little.

1640
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:55,680
I actually don't know.

1641
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:59,100
On the Twitch stream it looked so much more different than...

1642
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:01,520
How it did in like...

1643
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,600
I've watched some...

1644
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,100
Some videos of it.

1645
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:06,700
That people took and they...

1646
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:09,420
It looked really nice, but on the live stream itself...

1647
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,560
It looked kind of like...

1648
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,160
It was like very orange and strange looking.

1649
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,700
But it was like at some art gallery.

1650
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:20,000
Corner, corner, corner.

1651
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,380
If you guys are mentioning this one by the way...

1652
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:27,300
I've already gotten it.

1653
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,300
That one over there.

1654
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,640
I've already gotten it, so...

1655
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:34,920
Elijah Wood shows up everywhere.

1656
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:37,540
That guy is so cool.

1657
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:38,960
He's like so chill.

1658
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:40,540
I don't even think he...

1659
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,160
Thinks he's like a celebrity, you know.

1660
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,540
Corner, corner.

1661
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,940
Like this corner.

1662
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,800
I'm outside the bounds.

1663
01:44:01,570 --> 01:44:03,670
I got all five!

1664
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:12,930
Do you wear wigs?

1665
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:18,110
Whoops, I died.

1666
01:44:18,570 --> 01:44:20,430
I feel like the...

1667
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:23,630
Cast of Lord of the Rings are just so...

1668
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:23,950
I don't know.

1669
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:26,270
I don't know really much anything about them, but they...

1670
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:28,910
Have this like appearance of just being...

1671
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:30,190
Such chill, fun people.

1672
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:33,890
That interview was so funny.

1673
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:36,150
You know what's so funny too is I...

1674
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:38,610
When I first saw it, I didn't realize...

1675
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:39,010
That it was...

1676
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:43,510
Oh my god, your face.

1677
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:45,210
I pooted on stream.

1678
01:44:46,810 --> 01:44:48,430
I didn't realize that...

1679
01:44:51,190 --> 01:44:53,050
That it was one of the actors.

1680
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:56,710
I didn't realize it was...

1681
01:44:57,450 --> 01:44:57,950
Sam?

1682
01:44:58,850 --> 01:44:59,830
What's that guy's name?

1683
01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:01,850
What's the other one with Frodo?

1684
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:10,820
Was it Sam?

1685
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:11,720
Oh, it was Mary.

1686
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,740
I didn't realize it was one of the guys.

1687
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,480
I thought it was just some random...

1688
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,700
Weirdo interviewer.

1689
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:21,880
Oh, I can increase my rod power.

1690
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:27,060
Okay.

1691
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:31,480
Wait, how do I get the spectral one?

1692
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:32,580
I got all of them now.

1693
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:40,910
How much wood could an Elijah Wood...

1694
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:42,810
Would if Elijah Wood could Elijah Wood?

1695
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:49,630
Waterfall.

1696
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:51,690
I know waterfall.

1697
01:45:53,310 --> 01:45:53,930
Over here.

1698
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:55,210
Why you got...

1699
01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:57,130
Why you got that look on your face for?

1700
01:45:57,770 --> 01:45:58,290
Sussy.

1701
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,760
I waterfalled too hard?

1702
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,820
I think.

1703
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,560
Don't forget if you've been in...

1704
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,580
The lobby for a little bit.

1705
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:31,140
I don't know if it's full or not.

1706
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:33,160
Honestly, I haven't been running into so many people.

1707
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,200
But if you've been in the lobby for a little bit...

1708
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:38,180
Please allow others to have a chance to enter the lobby.

1709
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:40,380
The...

1710
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,120
Code is in members.

1711
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:44,920
So...

1712
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:46,380
Yeah.

1713
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:50,100
Just allow other people to...

1714
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,020
To come in.

1715
01:46:54,730 --> 01:46:55,750
Where is members?

1716
01:46:56,150 --> 01:46:57,350
Like the community tab?

1717
01:46:58,390 --> 01:47:00,590
Like I posted it as a members community post?

1718
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:04,110
Different waterfall?

1719
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:08,590
Where was another one?

1720
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:11,730
Where was another waterfall?

1721
01:47:12,350 --> 01:47:13,490
This game is so relaxing.

1722
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:17,810
Say maybe 10 minutes off limit?

1723
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:18,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1724
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:19,350
That's what I said earlier.

1725
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:21,390
But good to remind.

1726
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:22,110
Hello.

1727
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:25,730
Did you just hiss at... What the hell is that guy?

1728
01:47:25,810 --> 01:47:26,510
What is that?

1729
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:46,840
How?

1730
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,380
There is stealth fishing.

1731
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:51,660
Can I get up there?

1732
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,080
Hi.

1733
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,960
No ghost allowed in the fort.

1734
01:47:59,600 --> 01:47:59,880
No.

1735
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:01,960
I can make it.

1736
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:02,540
Hi.

1737
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:07,040
Oh my god.

1738
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:07,440
Wait!

1739
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:08,760
That's so close.

1740
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:18,960
Ok, hold on.

1741
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:20,020
We are on a mission.

1742
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:21,880
We gotta go find another waterfall.

1743
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:24,040
Waterfall, waterfall.

1744
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:28,780
Is this where they died?

1745
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:34,460
Oh my god!

1746
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:35,880
Why is there a toilet in here?

1747
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,160
Spectral hand!

1748
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:47,960
I lost...

1749
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:49,300
The game.

1750
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:55,520
I only have 29 dollars.

1751
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:57,320
Ok, I'll come back.

1752
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,320
500 dollars.

1753
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,100
Don't mind me.

1754
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:06,740
I'm just fishing behind you.

1755
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:07,960
What are you doing here anyway?

1756
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:09,720
You're not even fishing.

1757
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:23,640
Noice.

1758
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:24,200
Goodbye.

1759
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,020
A tiny koi.

1760
01:49:38,380 --> 01:49:39,060
I

1761
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,100
can barely see it.

1762
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:45,720
I know, right?

1763
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,660
Just chilling.

1764
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:59,120
We're just chilling.

1765
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:01,320
Just vibing.

1766
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:02,820
Just fishing.

1767
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:04,320
You know?

1768
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,380
I think it's time to gamble.

1769
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:05,660
No!

1770
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:05,760
No!

1771
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:08,820
We have to get 500 dollars.

1772
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,260
And then we can gamble everything.

1773
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:14,660
Then we won't even have a life to gamble away because we...

1774
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:17,260
We'll have...

1775
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:20,320
We will have a ghost rod.

1776
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:26,380
Why don't the fish like me?

1777
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,000
Why don't the fish like me, huh?

1778
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:37,940
Why don't they ever come to me?

1779
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,060
Oh my god, everybody is hissing at me.

1780
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:43,420
Oh, I got one!

1781
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:48,580
Have you looked at your own hat?

1782
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,820
Do you think it actually is a debuff?

1783
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,820
Oh, we got a small carp.

1784
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,760
I guess... Oh my gosh, can you imagine?

1785
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:06,020
The fish fear is a real debuff hat.

1786
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:11,120
They said we fear nothing.

1787
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:14,120
Okay, I challenged them and now they're...

1788
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:17,420
Now they're fine.

1789
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,200
Oh, a huge goldfish.

1790
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,000
Okay, we got to get more bait.

1791
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:27,380
Yeah, this game does have a bait system.

1792
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:30,980
So...

1793
01:51:30,980 --> 01:51:32,840
What did I...

1794
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:34,020
I caught a koi.

1795
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:35,320
We get money for that.

1796
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:35,780
Nice.

1797
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:40,100
If I just buy a bunch of stuff...

1798
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:43,100
Or rather, if I catch a bunch of stuff...

1799
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,520
I caved and bought the game.

1800
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,920
Oh, and it's raining here too.

1801
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:47,300
Nice.

1802
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,400
Thanks for catching the octopus earlier.

1803
01:51:50,660 --> 01:51:52,180
They're my absolute favorite animal.

1804
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:52,680
Really?

1805
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:06,550
Okay, nice.

1806
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:11,630
We got a...

1807
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:14,850
Crab!

1808
01:52:14,850 --> 01:52:15,310
That's...

1809
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:19,270
The tiniest crab I might have ever seen in my entire afterlife.

1810
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:24,160
Crab.

1811
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:28,740
Octopuses are pretty cute.

1812
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,280
Don't be so crabby.

1813
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:35,120
Look at everybody just chilling.

1814
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:36,900
Oh, I got another thing.

1815
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:37,640
Nice.

1816
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:38,580
Skull.

1817
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,580
Wow, what is that?

1818
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,600
How are you guys both catching them?

1819
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:54,460
Come on, give me a fish.

1820
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:55,600
Come on, stupid fish.

1821
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:58,600
Oh, just insult the fish and... Oh my goodness.

1822
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:01,940
Okay, insult the fish and they come to you.

1823
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:04,800
Hi, Saifa.

1824
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:08,020
It's nice to see you enjoying yourself.

1825
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:10,100
Having so much fun with this.

1826
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:12,780
I got work in five hours, so it's time to sleep.

1827
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:14,180
Good night, Minto and Wisp.

1828
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:14,780
Good night!

1829
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:17,000
Oh my gosh, why didn't you go to sleep sooner?

1830
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:19,000
A large bullfin.

1831
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:27,960
Cause I got work.

1832
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:33,360
Someone said it's funny when you kick someone.

1833
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,180
Do you want to try?

1834
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:37,460
Maybe.

1835
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:41,360
Question.

1836
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:43,840
Do you read missed superchats between streams?

1837
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:46,040
I wonder if you saw my whole Snake Eater song.

1838
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:53,040
When did you send that?

1839
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:53,320
Yes.

1840
01:53:56,340 --> 01:54:00,260
Sometimes I go back and read the ones that I missed on stream.

1841
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,420
But I didn't... When did you?

1842
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,340
During the final boss fight.

1843
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:16,000
Oh, I thought you meant like recently.

1844
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:20,220
I thought you meant like...

1845
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:26,760
Wait, you mean like during Snake Eater?

1846
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:36,650
Has anyone joked about the master bait yet?

1847
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:39,870
Yeah, I'm a master baiter.

1848
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:44,530
You know, I have all the... Well, I actually don't have the best bait.

1849
01:54:44,970 --> 01:54:47,810
I only have little worms, you know.

1850
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:50,570
So...

1851
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:57,070
But I remember people... I think I remember you sending it though.

1852
01:54:58,290 --> 01:54:59,270
During... it?

1853
01:55:00,370 --> 01:55:05,310
Sometimes I might read and I don't react if I don't... Especially if it's during a final fight like that.

1854
01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:06,530
Sorry.

1855
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:13,280
I'm gonna go sell.

1856
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:18,900
Salmon.

1857
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:20,700
Yummy.

1858
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:22,440
Nice, okay.

1859
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:26,080
Happy belated Dia de los Muertos.

1860
01:55:27,120 --> 01:55:28,800
I just love Latinas, Minto.

1861
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:33,280
Thank you... Oh gosh, you scared me.

1862
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:34,800
Hello!

1863
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:37,340
You made it in!

1864
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:38,260
You made it in!

1865
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:40,400
Oops.

1866
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:42,940
Oh, let's sell.

1867
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:50,200
Let's see... I don't want to sell all my cool guys.

1868
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,360
I think we might have to sell everything to get enough money.

1869
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,620
This stick is five dollars.

1870
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:03,620
Goldfish.

1871
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:05,180
Goldfin.

1872
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,180
My dogfish.

1873
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:08,180
My octopus.

1874
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:11,540
Oh, we're so close actually.

1875
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:12,340
Oh my gosh.

1876
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:20,300
I think I've seen you around for quite a bit.

1877
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:23,620
So if you don't mind leaving so other people can come in.

1878
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:24,640
Thank you.

1879
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:27,960
I too wish for Minto...

1880
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:28,360
Stop!

1881
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:28,460
Stop!

1882
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,820
I'm from the Fish and Wildlife Commission.

1883
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,620
You don't need a license to fish, do you?

1884
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:47,780
You do?

1885
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,960
That's a certain age up here in Canada.

1886
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:58,500
I thought fishing was a free... What the hell is that?

1887
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:01,660
That's the ugliest fish I've ever seen.

1888
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:05,060
Hey, I'm fishing here.

1889
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,620
Depends on the place.

1890
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:13,240
Can't just kill... I'm not killing them, I'm catching them and I'm releasing them.

1891
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:23,060
I'm currently doing an MGS3 foxhound run.

1892
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:23,860
Holy moly.

1893
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:24,620
Good luck!

1894
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:28,500
If you are catching a lot of tree branches, don't take it.

1895
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,620
You have to stick it to the...

1896
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:36,540
You take the fish and then you throw them back in.

1897
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:41,540
Unfortunately, a percentage die when you release them.

1898
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:45,020
Is it because they have the thing stuck in their mouth?

1899
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:51,440
Catch and release is still detrimental.

1900
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:51,920
What?

1901
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:57,360
This is why I've never fished... Well, I've fished before, but it was with my uncle.

1902
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,380
What the hell was that?

1903
01:57:59,520 --> 01:57:59,940
Oh my gosh.

1904
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:01,520
Wait, it's the little swirly guy.

1905
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,200
It's the guy with the swirly bottom mouth.

1906
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,260
Makes me happy to know you read your old messages.

1907
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:14,040
Sent my first ever Akasupa during your 3.0 with a super sappy message.

1908
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:19,220
Wait, I'm gonna have to go back and say it again though.

1909
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,320
There were so many for that stream.

1910
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:28,960
But yeah, I do try because, you know, I can't catch all of them always, but...

1911
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:32,240
I do try to go back and look through stuff.

1912
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:35,320
And I read people's comments and stuff on stream.

1913
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:43,100
Finally, I got a fish.

1914
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:46,240
I might have to do the upgrade where you like...

1915
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,340
Get the... What's it called?

1916
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:55,720
Where you get the higher rank percentage of fish, you know.

1917
01:59:01,670 --> 01:59:02,990
The catch rate upgrade?

1918
01:59:03,190 --> 01:59:04,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1919
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:05,010
I think I need...

1920
01:59:05,010 --> 01:59:05,690
What the?

1921
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:09,030
Did you just catch that?

1922
01:59:11,430 --> 01:59:12,470
Oh my god.

1923
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:14,030
Better bait helps.

1924
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:15,990
I know, I'm not getting anything.

1925
01:59:16,130 --> 01:59:16,850
This sucks.

1926
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:34,040
This game is making me sleepy though.

1927
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,540
This game is making me so sleepy.

1928
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:40,540
I did level my rod once.

1929
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,960
Maybe I should save on the spectral.

1930
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:49,040
Until we have a better everything overall.

1931
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:54,880
A large mouth bass.

1932
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:01,000
Frog guy for upgrades.

1933
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

1934
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:06,440
Hope you're having a wonderful time on the game.

1935
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:08,820
This comfy background noise is making my time sick enjoyable.

1936
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:09,520
No!

1937
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:11,320
Grosses!

1938
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:12,380
Feel better!

1939
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:15,340
Oh my gosh, I didn't recognize you at first.

1940
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:17,400
Your profile picture.

1941
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:22,060
Rod power is important.

1942
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:22,760
Yeah.

1943
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:28,680
Okay, after this fish... After next fish, I'll level up.

1944
02:00:35,160 --> 02:00:39,520
I have to

1945
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:45,690
get going kind of soon-ish.

1946
02:00:47,930 --> 02:00:48,650
Hello?

1947
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:49,590
Fish.

1948
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:51,410
Whoa, what is that one?

1949
02:00:51,470 --> 02:00:53,670
It's like a little bomb.

1950
02:00:54,950 --> 02:00:56,730
Looks like a little mine in the water.

1951
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:05,600
The gang is all...

1952
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:09,120
You look too happy.

1953
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:11,500
What's taking you so long?

1954
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:12,380
Get that fish!

1955
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:13,540
Oh my gosh.

1956
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:15,740
You got it!

1957
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:20,100
Everybody has the spectral rod.

1958
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:20,920
I'm so jealous.

1959
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:25,560
New profile pic of my dragoon in a dragoon suit during the day 21.

1960
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:28,720
They still think I'm a birch.

1961
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:30,480
Wait!

1962
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:31,840
Oh, nope, that's not me.

1963
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:33,960
It's everybody else around me, but me.

1964
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:39,280
Today is Godzilla's birthday.

1965
02:01:39,540 --> 02:01:40,100
Oh, wait!

1966
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:42,740
They announced a new movie coming out.

1967
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:46,500
So much Godzilla content recently.

1968
02:01:50,230 --> 02:01:52,530
Okay, I can't stand this anymore.

1969
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:54,350
I'm not getting anything, you guys.

1970
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:55,770
This sucks.

1971
02:01:56,330 --> 02:01:57,210
I'm leaving.

1972
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:00,970
Oh, there's another one.

1973
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:03,110
Cute!

1974
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:04,790
Booty!

1975
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:09,530
Oh, cute!

1976
02:02:09,870 --> 02:02:11,030
The cool ass.

1977
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:16,430
Pokemon that resembles me.

1978
02:02:17,150 --> 02:02:17,830
Gengar.

1979
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:21,950
So I can get a leech's license.

1980
02:02:22,290 --> 02:02:24,810
I'll probably bring all the fish to the yard.

1981
02:02:25,770 --> 02:02:28,870
I think we need the rod chance up too.

1982
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:40,820
Since you like Hideo Kojima games...

1983
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:44,920
Yeah, I plan on playing Zone of the Enders someday.

1984
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:50,620
Gain a small amount of cash for every catch?

1985
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:52,520
That's huge!

1986
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:56,160
Catches have a higher chance of being smaller fish.

1987
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:57,260
That's strange.

1988
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:01,140
I guess for specific quests you would need it.

1989
02:03:03,700 --> 02:03:06,300
Pop-ups appear during the fishing minigame.

1990
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,180
Clicking them gives cash, but missing them hurts you.

1991
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:12,160
Get the crickets?

1992
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:12,580
OK.

1993
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:14,600
I'm going to get the lucky hook.

1994
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:16,780
And I'm going to get the crickets.

1995
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:18,820
And I'm going to get...

1996
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:21,820
Chance up and...

1997
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:24,560
Max bathe up.

1998
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:25,160
OK.

1999
02:03:27,580 --> 02:03:28,640
How does it hurt you?

2000
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:29,580
Is there health in this game?

2001
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:34,280
These cost money!

2002
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,500
I at least have 10 of them.

2003
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:46,940
I have 10 crickets.

2004
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:55,640
OK, I'm going to get all the big boys now, guys.

2005
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,160
And yeah, I am using the crickets.

2006
02:04:07,180 --> 02:04:08,160
Equip your hook too.

2007
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:09,060
Oh, thank you.

2008
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:10,440
I got a leech!

2009
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:11,780
Leech!

2010
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:12,980
You came back to me!

2011
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:17,960
Oh my gosh, we linked up!

2012
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:21,780
Wait, how do I... Oh, there we go.

2013
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:22,360
Lucky hook.

2014
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:30,320
Mint, what?

2015
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:32,520
What did I say?

2016
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:33,160
What did I do?

2017
02:04:47,330 --> 02:04:49,750
Oh, I had to... My hook?

2018
02:04:52,330 --> 02:04:55,510
Yeah, someone said remember to attach your hook too.

2019
02:04:56,090 --> 02:04:57,170
So I said yes, OK.

2020
02:04:57,570 --> 02:05:00,670
And I didn't... I hadn't attached it.

2021
02:05:16,610 --> 02:05:18,710
I hate this world!

2022
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:20,910
I hate this world!

2023
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:27,150
I thought they were giving me legitimate advice!

2024
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:29,270
A large perch.

2025
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:43,040
I'm fishing here, guys.

2026
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:44,280
My brain...

2027
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:47,320
My brain... I'm fish brained right now.

2028
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:55,530
I'm not thinking about no internet lingo or whatever you youngsters are talking about on the interwebs.

2029
02:05:56,020 --> 02:06:00,980
I'm talking about real slimy fish.

2030
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:04,180
It's fishing hours.

2031
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:06,380
Oh, I got a huge walleye.

2032
02:06:10,130 --> 02:06:11,830
It's a fishing time.

2033
02:06:11,950 --> 02:06:14,470
How much money am I collecting from this, I wonder?

2034
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:17,610
I'm fish brained.

2035
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:21,830
Are fish slimy?

2036
02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:23,170
Fish are...

2037
02:06:27,710 --> 02:06:28,350
Fish

2038
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:34,100
are...

2039
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:34,900
Slippery?

2040
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:37,440
They can be slimy?

2041
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:38,740
Usually, generally?

2042
02:06:38,980 --> 02:06:39,100
OK.

2043
02:06:43,580 --> 02:06:44,840
When am I gonna catch a...

2044
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:49,520
Fishing for me!

2045
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:50,600
I love fish.

2046
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:53,040
Fishing is a patience game, guys.

2047
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:57,720
You gotta just sit there and hope that you one day catch a fish.

2048
02:06:59,860 --> 02:07:01,660
I have something on the board.

2049
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:05,980
I caught a leech!

2050
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:09,560
What is my... What is my title that I can get?

2051
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:12,240
Wait, is it under...

2052
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:14,300
How do I change my title again?

2053
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:15,620
Oh, here.

2054
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:17,580
Nightcrawler.

2055
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:26,320
The pretty title.

2056
02:07:27,660 --> 02:07:28,700
The prettiest.

2057
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,200
Tenderfoot.

2058
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:32,620
What did I get that from?

2059
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,500
Koi boy.

2060
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:41,540
Everybody is right here.

2061
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:45,400
I think it's about time though that you guys switch out.

2062
02:07:47,560 --> 02:07:50,400
So if you have been here for a bit...

2063
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:51,780
Time to switch out.

2064
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,340
Let some other people come in and have a chance.

2065
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,760
That guy is fishing from the toilet.

2066
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:03,720
So thank you guys.

2067
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:07,800
Thank you, thank you.

2068
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:11,280
Oh my god, those eyes.

2069
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:13,700
It's so scary.

2070
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:18,020
Why you gotta look at me with them eyes?

2071
02:08:19,140 --> 02:08:20,680
I like those ones too though.

2072
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:22,080
I like these ones too.

2073
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,360
Minto hasn't switched out this whole time.

2074
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:33,620
Okay, I'm just gonna leave the room then.

2075
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:36,080
Oh, oh, I accidentally...

2076
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:37,900
Am I gonna catch a fish?

2077
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,920
Everybody literally here has caught a fish but me.

2078
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:42,180
Thank you guys, thank you.

2079
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:45,800
Pack up and I'll see you guys later.

2080
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:48,360
Oh, goodbye.

2081
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:51,360
Don't, don't, don't like...

2082
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:51,840
Oh, me!

2083
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:52,780
It's my turn!

2084
02:08:53,580 --> 02:08:54,260
Oh my god.

2085
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,300
Stop kissing me, I'm trying to...

2086
02:08:56,300 --> 02:08:57,760
I'm trying to fish!

2087
02:09:04,340 --> 02:09:05,900
What's wrong with y'all?

2088
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:09,160
Y'all don't know the fishing life.

2089
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:12,360
Did I just hear someone laugh?

2090
02:09:19,850 --> 02:09:21,770
Fishing ain't about...

2091
02:09:24,830 --> 02:09:25,790
Team Alien?

2092
02:09:27,150 --> 02:09:28,230
Big Minto laugh?

2093
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:29,930
Thank you!

2094
02:09:30,530 --> 02:09:31,530
What the heck?

2095
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:32,470
Why?

2096
02:09:35,050 --> 02:09:35,890
Thank you.

2097
02:09:36,150 --> 02:09:37,270
What is that fish?

2098
02:09:37,290 --> 02:09:38,310
It's ugly though.

2099
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:39,790
What is that?

2100
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:42,590
It looks like a dog.

2101
02:09:43,550 --> 02:09:44,690
Why does it look like that?

2102
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:49,830
Why does it look like that?

2103
02:09:52,450 --> 02:09:54,530
Oh, are you sad that I called your fish ugly?

2104
02:09:54,530 --> 02:09:56,690
It's really a good fish catch.

2105
02:10:01,070 --> 02:10:02,490
Oh god!

2106
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:08,650
I'm going back.

2107
02:10:09,090 --> 02:10:09,710
No, wait!

2108
02:10:12,710 --> 02:10:13,770
No, why?

2109
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:16,750
Why do I always die?

2110
02:10:18,090 --> 02:10:21,430
Is it my destiny as a ghost to just always die?

2111
02:10:21,430 --> 02:10:21,550
Why?

2112
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:27,190
I'm gonna check out this little pond right here.

2113
02:10:29,210 --> 02:10:30,870
I showed you my fish.

2114
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:34,270
And I mean, it took up the whole screen.

2115
02:10:34,470 --> 02:10:35,670
It was a grand fish.

2116
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:37,050
It was great.

2117
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:44,380
I'm dead.

2118
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:46,320
That's why I'm just like in games.

2119
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:48,700
Am I supposed to die to...

2120
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:49,900
To match me?

2121
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:52,180
Look at this dramatic.

2122
02:10:52,180 --> 02:10:54,320
This is the...

2123
02:10:54,940 --> 02:10:58,000
Metal Gear Solid 5 scene when you're...

2124
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,620
When you're in the truck with Skull Face.

2125
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:19,980
If you die in fish game, you die in real life.

2126
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:21,720
Oh, got me one dollar.

2127
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:25,020
Thank you for hosting today, Minto.

2128
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:25,520
I was fine.

2129
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:26,380
Thanks for joining.

2130
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:30,680
That MGS5 scene when you're fishing.

2131
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:32,400
Thanks for the letters, guys.

2132
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,960
I will check them off stream.

2133
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:36,860
It's not that I don't trust you or anything.

2134
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,100
It's just that I don't want to...

2135
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:41,180
Accidentally have something happen, you know?

2136
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:44,500
That's all.

2137
02:11:47,180 --> 02:11:47,960
Welcome, welcome.

2138
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:55,620
I got the game so I could join with y'all, but...

2139
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:58,220
Wanted to get some cosmetics first...

2140
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:00,480
And ended up being rizzed up midi guitar.

2141
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:01,360
Wait, what?

2142
02:12:04,020 --> 02:12:06,840
Is some guy helping me get the spectral rod instead?

2143
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:09,280
What the hell?

2144
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:10,940
You got rizzed?

2145
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:12,120
Oh my gosh.

2146
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:13,600
Web fishing rizz.

2147
02:12:20,190 --> 02:12:21,930
Did that mail bug get fixed?

2148
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:23,710
I don't know.

2149
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:26,730
Right before this stream, I had a friend message me...

2150
02:12:26,730 --> 02:12:28,830
And she was just like, by the way...

2151
02:12:28,830 --> 02:12:31,930
Maybe be careful with web fishing because I had someone...

2152
02:12:31,930 --> 02:12:34,770
That hacked into my game without the code.

2153
02:12:35,290 --> 02:12:37,650
And then was like spamming stuff.

2154
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:39,890
And then also was...

2155
02:12:41,510 --> 02:12:43,650
And then was also like...

2156
02:12:43,650 --> 02:12:47,070
Making her character do crazy things and everything.

2157
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:50,130
But they were disguised as a dev.

2158
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:51,970
And...

2159
02:12:55,190 --> 02:12:55,670
Um...

2160
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:00,950
But I wonder too if maybe it was because...

2161
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:03,190
She, like, maybe it's a...

2162
02:13:03,190 --> 02:13:05,650
Maybe it's someone like targeting people on Twitch.

2163
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:06,750
You know?

2164
02:13:07,370 --> 02:13:10,430
Because everyone that I've seen talk about that has been like Twitch streamers.

2165
02:13:10,930 --> 02:13:13,030
They probably just go to the...

2166
02:13:13,890 --> 02:13:15,730
Who's playing web fishing.

2167
02:13:16,090 --> 02:13:17,210
Oh, I have three.

2168
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:18,370
I have three crickets left.

2169
02:13:18,410 --> 02:13:19,930
I was like, I have no more crickets.

2170
02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:22,310
Um, so...

2171
02:13:23,910 --> 02:13:25,790
I think maybe it's...

2172
02:13:26,370 --> 02:13:26,850
Maybe...

2173
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:30,950
Maybe I would be safer is all.

2174
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:32,710
Oh, oh gosh!

2175
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:34,490
It's a big one, boys!

2176
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:35,690
It's a big one, boys!

2177
02:13:38,610 --> 02:13:41,290
I got a large king salmon!

2178
02:13:45,730 --> 02:13:48,270
I think the dev said they fixed it on Twitter.

2179
02:13:48,510 --> 02:13:48,950
Oh, okay.

2180
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:51,190
Nice!

2181
02:13:51,850 --> 02:13:53,350
Big fish, big fish, big fish.

2182
02:13:55,230 --> 02:13:56,790
You are king.

2183
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:05,020
Remember when so many VTubers used to sing king?

2184
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:08,360
What's like the VTuber song now?

2185
02:14:08,620 --> 02:14:10,120
We don't really have one, I feel.

2186
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:13,660
Nowadays, not like every VTuber...

2187
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:15,620
Goes for.

2188
02:14:20,080 --> 02:14:21,220
Still king.

2189
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:22,660
Oh, idol?

2190
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:28,060
Like the U.S.O.B.

2191
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:28,320
song?

2192
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:38,640
Huge perch.

2193
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:41,440
Let's go sell some stuff.

2194
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:43,280
Oh, actually, wait, hold on.

2195
02:14:47,340 --> 02:14:49,040
Let's wait, I have one more cricket.

2196
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:51,380
So I'll use my cricket and then I'll...

2197
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:53,020
Creepy nut songs.

2198
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:55,140
Plastic love.

2199
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:57,400
Yeah, but karaoke and covers I think are different.

2200
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:03,380
I've not been watching VTubers long enough, probably not much more than a year.

2201
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:07,040
That's okay.

2202
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:08,540
Kyofu all back.

2203
02:15:08,660 --> 02:15:10,560
Oh yeah, I wanted to cover that too though.

2204
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:16,040
If I cover it, you better still watch it, okay?

2205
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:18,860
Guys!

2206
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:19,540
Guys!

2207
02:15:19,900 --> 02:15:20,340
Guys!

2208
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:21,920
Guys!

2209
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:22,780
Guys!

2210
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:24,040
I think it's a big one!

2211
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:25,520
I think it's a really big guy!

2212
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:31,320
I got...

2213
02:15:31,940 --> 02:15:33,220
I got a shiny!

2214
02:15:34,220 --> 02:15:35,660
I got a star!

2215
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:37,620
A shining large bow fin!

2216
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:44,400
Fish fact, Pacific salmon will slowly rot to death after returning to their spawning grounds.

2217
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:46,260
I know that, it's so sad.

2218
02:15:47,860 --> 02:15:48,420
Wow!

2219
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:50,080
We got a shining!

2220
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:55,800
I have to go back to get more bait.

2221
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:01,100
I can't believe I got a shiny!

2222
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:05,400
Nice.

2223
02:16:12,890 --> 02:16:14,030
Hi there.

2224
02:16:17,050 --> 02:16:18,250
Who's kissing?

2225
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:21,650
Who's kissing out here?

2226
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:25,090
Let's see.

2227
02:16:25,790 --> 02:16:27,350
Crickets are kind of expensive.

2228
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:30,370
I have so many perches.

2229
02:16:34,010 --> 02:16:35,610
Wow, the leech is expensive.

2230
02:16:36,070 --> 02:16:38,010
King salmon is 134.

2231
02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:43,510
I want to sell it, but I also don't want to, you know?

2232
02:16:46,110 --> 02:16:47,070
Who farted?

2233
02:16:48,030 --> 02:16:48,510
You!

2234
02:16:48,510 --> 02:16:48,610
You!

2235
02:16:52,230 --> 02:16:53,470
This guy here, hello!

2236
02:16:53,950 --> 02:16:54,550
Hello, hello!

2237
02:16:54,710 --> 02:16:55,690
Welcome, welcome in.

2238
02:16:56,070 --> 02:16:58,290
You know, we're web fishing, we're chilling.

2239
02:16:59,150 --> 02:17:00,430
Okay guys, I'm gonna go by.

2240
02:17:02,010 --> 02:17:04,470
I have to get going in about 10 minutes.

2241
02:17:05,090 --> 02:17:05,710
So sad.

2242
02:17:06,490 --> 02:17:09,590
This has been so relaxing though, just kind of chilling with you guys.

2243
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:16,770
Sorry that it's a much shorter stream today.

2244
02:17:18,510 --> 02:17:20,630
Oh gosh, I think I'm going into the water.

2245
02:17:23,850 --> 02:17:26,710
But thank you guys for being all good and everything.

2246
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:33,200
Picnic!

2247
02:17:33,660 --> 02:17:35,080
Oh, this is how you get the picnic blanket.

2248
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,440
We can just have a whole picnic area.

2249
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:38,920
Metal detector.

2250
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:42,620
Hold down to search for hidden treasure around the map?

2251
02:17:44,940 --> 02:17:45,420
Wait.

2252
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:48,660
We can find hidden treasure?

2253
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:05,440
Okay.

2254
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:08,840
Wait, stop, stop, stop.

2255
02:18:09,300 --> 02:18:10,480
How do I...

2256
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:13,020
Miscellaneous?

2257
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:14,320
Oh, king title.

2258
02:18:14,540 --> 02:18:15,060
Wow!

2259
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:17,060
Royalty.

2260
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:19,140
Alright, metal detector.

2261
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:21,480
I don't know how to...

2262
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:30,860
What the?

2263
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,620
You stole the treasure from me!

2264
02:18:35,440 --> 02:18:36,960
How dare you!

2265
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:39,300
Oh my god.

2266
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:43,300
It was my first treasure and it got stolen from under my nose!

2267
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:46,480
So rude!

2268
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:49,260
How dare you!

2269
02:18:50,900 --> 02:18:52,100
How dare you!

2270
02:18:52,220 --> 02:18:53,240
I take it all back.

2271
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:54,780
I said you guys were being good.

2272
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:56,540
Not being good at all.

2273
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:59,000
You're stealing my tre... Wait, is there literally nothing else?

2274
02:19:03,020 --> 02:19:05,260
Was that the only treasure left on the island?

2275
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:08,160
No way!

2276
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:16,850
The only treasure on the island got stolen from me!

2277
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:19,670
Wait, I need to get some bait.

2278
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:25,150
Why are these little buddy guys all over the place?

2279
02:19:25,310 --> 02:19:27,790
Take your pets home with you when you leave, please.

2280
02:19:30,490 --> 02:19:32,250
There really is nothing left.

2281
02:19:33,750 --> 02:19:35,070
There's bait over there.

2282
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:40,190
Only on sand.

2283
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:41,690
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2284
02:19:42,730 --> 02:19:43,850
Okay, okay, okay.

2285
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:45,610
Only on sand, everybody.

2286
02:19:46,950 --> 02:19:50,310
Hold on, we gotta get bait so we can try for some big fish in the rain.

2287
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:55,350
Oh, it is not only on sand.

2288
02:19:57,970 --> 02:19:59,010
Never mind!

2289
02:19:59,130 --> 02:20:00,770
There's nothing left, you guys!

2290
02:20:02,490 --> 02:20:04,250
I'm so sad right now.

2291
02:20:07,390 --> 02:20:09,070
I'm so sad!

2292
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:13,790
Go away!

2293
02:20:14,050 --> 02:20:16,070
I don't wanna see your stinky face anymore!

2294
02:20:18,050 --> 02:20:19,550
I got robbed.

2295
02:20:20,370 --> 02:20:21,650
I got robbed!

2296
02:20:23,970 --> 02:20:25,530
Someone's up there.

2297
02:20:31,850 --> 02:20:33,410
My one treasure.

2298
02:20:34,830 --> 02:20:36,890
What are you guys doing over there?

2299
02:20:37,070 --> 02:20:38,370
Creeping behind me.

2300
02:20:39,730 --> 02:20:41,630
You're here to steal my treasure?

2301
02:20:41,810 --> 02:20:43,130
You're here to steal my fish?

2302
02:20:44,010 --> 02:20:47,030
A little

2303
02:20:51,950 --> 02:20:52,810
fish.

2304
02:20:52,890 --> 02:20:53,550
Fishing time.

2305
02:20:54,730 --> 02:20:58,030
Do the different lures do anything or are they just...

2306
02:20:59,530 --> 02:21:00,690
Cosmetic as well?

2307
02:21:01,410 --> 02:21:03,030
A huge angelfish!

2308
02:21:06,470 --> 02:21:08,090
What are you showing off?

2309
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:09,370
Is that the angelfish?

2310
02:21:09,450 --> 02:21:10,270
That's the one I just caught.

2311
02:21:11,290 --> 02:21:14,530
The biggest treasure is still right here on our screens.

2312
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:20,760
I'm not worth anything!

2313
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:23,620
You can't sell me for a price!

2314
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:26,100
I need cold hard cash!

2315
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:27,780
What are you talking about?

2316
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:30,920
The hat.

2317
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:37,920
I need...

2318
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:39,060
Oh god!

2319
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:40,340
That scared the hell out of me.

2320
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:41,700
Oh my god!

2321
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:43,200
I see your fish!

2322
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:43,640
Thank you!

2323
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:44,220
Put it away!

2324
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,820
I'm trying to catch fish here.

2325
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:59,060
One day I will have caught a ginormous fish and I will shove it in your faces.

2326
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:02,740
Oh I leveled up!

2327
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:03,080
Yay!

2328
02:22:04,180 --> 02:22:07,460
Are you showing off the treasure that you found?

2329
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:09,480
From stealing it?

2330
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:11,640
Stealing it with the metal detector?

2331
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:16,600
You got it.

2332
02:22:16,660 --> 02:22:17,220
I got what?

2333
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:18,360
Take my money.

2334
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:22,240
Thank you.

2335
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:26,080
Mint doesn't know how much ghost meat goes for on the black market.

2336
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:28,460
Ectoplasm?

2337
02:22:28,460 --> 02:22:31,400
Wait, the ectoplasm sails back?

2338
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:34,540
How many bones do we need for a spectral maid?

2339
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:46,240
The hip bone's connected to the tail bone.

2340
02:22:46,540 --> 02:22:50,340
The tail bone's connected to the butt bone.

2341
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:53,500
The butt bone's connected to the leg bone.

2342
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:56,980
The leg bone's connected to the foot bone.

2343
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:00,620
Okay, there's gotta be treasure over here.

2344
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,820
There's gotta be treasure up here.

2345
02:23:10,210 --> 02:23:11,390
What did I get?

2346
02:23:13,570 --> 02:23:15,310
I got a soda tab!

2347
02:23:23,170 --> 02:23:24,970
I got a button!

2348
02:23:27,010 --> 02:23:28,690
Oh my god, there's tons of stuff up here.

2349
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:31,810
There's tons of stuff up here.

2350
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:42,680
Where is it?

2351
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:45,480
Where is it?

2352
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:47,100
Where is it?

2353
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:48,900
Where is it?

2354
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:50,480
Where is it?

2355
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:51,360
Hello?

2356
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:52,980
Beep.

2357
02:23:57,150 --> 02:23:58,110
Am I stupid?

2358
02:24:00,410 --> 02:24:01,590
Where the hell is it?

2359
02:24:05,230 --> 02:24:06,750
Dramdor, thank you for the 20 gifted.

2360
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:07,850
Thank you so much.

2361
02:24:08,030 --> 02:24:10,070
Wish I was connected to your butt bone, stop.

2362
02:24:10,070 --> 02:24:10,270
Stop.

2363
02:24:13,310 --> 02:24:16,330
Offering 1 million dollars for proof of the paranormal.

2364
02:24:17,690 --> 02:24:18,530
Wait, actually?

2365
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:21,550
No, did I lose it?

2366
02:24:21,590 --> 02:24:22,170
Oh, no I didn't.

2367
02:24:23,190 --> 02:24:24,730
I feel like I'm gonna lose it though.

2368
02:24:25,550 --> 02:24:26,710
Where is it, you guys?

2369
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:29,750
Is it on one of the hills?

2370
02:24:30,870 --> 02:24:31,350
You think?

2371
02:24:31,770 --> 02:24:32,150
Oh!

2372
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:33,630
We found it!

2373
02:24:33,870 --> 02:24:34,910
A soda tab.

2374
02:24:37,590 --> 02:24:38,990
Can I sell all this stuff?

2375
02:24:42,310 --> 02:24:44,150
Isn't Minto proof of the paranormal?

2376
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:47,030
I mean...

2377
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:49,050
Filthy, filthy, filthy.

2378
02:24:49,810 --> 02:24:50,990
I mean...

2379
02:24:50,990 --> 02:24:53,110
Yeah, but like...

2380
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:54,330
You wouldn't...

2381
02:24:54,330 --> 02:24:56,990
You wouldn't like...

2382
02:24:57,990 --> 02:24:59,150
You wouldn't...

2383
02:24:59,150 --> 02:24:59,930
You wouldn't...

2384
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:05,670
You wouldn't... Wait, stop making my hat bigger.

2385
02:25:06,030 --> 02:25:08,670
You wouldn't sell me as proof of the paranormal, right?

2386
02:25:10,110 --> 02:25:10,990
You wouldn't...

2387
02:25:12,650 --> 02:25:13,950
You wouldn't do that.

2388
02:25:15,090 --> 02:25:17,650
Oh my gosh, I can't stop making the hat bigger.

2389
02:25:17,930 --> 02:25:21,550
You wouldn't do that, because if you did that, then you would have no more Minto streams.

2390
02:25:21,850 --> 02:25:24,130
You wouldn't do that so that you wouldn't sell me...

2391
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:25,310
You wouldn't sell me for money!

2392
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:35,590
Would you?

2393
02:25:40,990 --> 02:25:42,650
Would you sell me for money?

2394
02:25:49,830 --> 02:25:51,570
I think I'm gonna end today's stream.

2395
02:25:51,570 --> 02:25:53,470
Oh my god, my hat is really tiny.

2396
02:25:58,060 --> 02:25:59,100
Who's punching me?

2397
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:00,260
Stop, I'm AFK.

2398
02:26:04,980 --> 02:26:06,000
Wait, what's that?

2399
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:06,580
Hold on.

2400
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:09,340
Wait, hold on.

2401
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:11,280
I'm gonna get that.

2402
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:13,480
No, no, no.

2403
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:14,840
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2404
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:16,120
I want that spot.

2405
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:17,380
Hold on, I want that spot.

2406
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:18,240
No one else take it.

2407
02:26:18,260 --> 02:26:18,640
It's mine.

2408
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:19,720
Oh, it's gone.

2409
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:20,320
No!

2410
02:26:25,490 --> 02:26:27,370
Hi, James Randy Foundation.

2411
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:28,450
She's right here.

2412
02:26:28,690 --> 02:26:29,570
Two bucks for Minto.

2413
02:26:29,690 --> 02:26:30,910
Take it or leave it.

2414
02:26:38,140 --> 02:26:43,200
Are those spots with the little thing... Are those better?

2415
02:26:45,580 --> 02:26:47,620
You belong to the Kaiser Corporation now.

2416
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:47,840
No!

2417
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:50,760
It's such a chill stream, I hope.

2418
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:52,780
You could stream this again when you just want to relax.

2419
02:26:52,860 --> 02:26:54,300
Yeah, this has been really nice.

2420
02:26:54,300 --> 02:26:54,940
Thank you.

2421
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:58,100
Can be company during my long drive today.

2422
02:26:58,260 --> 02:26:58,840
Thank you.

2423
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:00,080
Drive safe.

2424
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,000
Best I can do is tree footing.

2425
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:07,020
Wait, I'm trapped down here.

2426
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:11,380
Stop showing off your stupid face.

2427
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:14,640
It's so big.

2428
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:19,040
Into the water.

2429
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:24,840
Okay, I'm safe up here.

2430
02:27:26,020 --> 02:27:27,480
This is fun, guys.

2431
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:28,640
Thank you.

2432
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:32,380
Hopefully we can fish again some other day.

2433
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:36,040
My schedule for this week will be up.

2434
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:40,920
But probably not until later tonight.

2435
02:27:43,060 --> 02:27:45,280
This was a lot of fun.

2436
02:27:45,420 --> 02:27:47,760
Thank you guys for fishing with me.

2437
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:48,940
I really appreciate it.

2438
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,060
Thank you for being so good.

2439
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:55,960
I will see you guys later.

2440
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:57,680
Enjoy the rest of your weekend.

2441
02:28:01,940 --> 02:28:02,660
Thank you.

2442
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:03,700
Bye bye.

2443
02:28:04,020 --> 02:28:04,780
Have a good night.
