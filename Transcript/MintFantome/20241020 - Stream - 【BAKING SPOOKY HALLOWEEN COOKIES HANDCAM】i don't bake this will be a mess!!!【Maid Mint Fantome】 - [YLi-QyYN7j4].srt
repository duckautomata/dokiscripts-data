1
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,570
I forgot to do something.

2
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,130
No!

3
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:42,950
Oh well.

4
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,870
Oh well.

5
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:45,890
Wait!

6
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,090
My time.

7
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,170
I could just do it now.

8
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,090
Oh,

9
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:11,950
that works.

10
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:12,830
Actually.

11
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,170
There we go.

12
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,850
Do I want a purple?

13
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,390
No.

14
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,950
Anyway.

15
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:27,530
Welcome to my baking stream!

16
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,830
I saw someone say that this BGM sounds like Touhou, right?

17
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,210
Doesn't it?

18
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,430
Sounds kind of like a Touhou song.

19
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,890
Oh!

20
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,210
Hold on.

21
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,690
Do you know how to bake?

22
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,320
We're gonna... It doesn't matter.

23
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,720
We're making today chocolate chip cookies.

24
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,620
But what matters the most is...

25
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,180
Is the shape.

26
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,220
Right?

27
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,020
We're gonna make them super spooky.

28
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,620
We're gonna make them...

29
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,860
Whatever we want.

30
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,960
I was thinking a bat.

31
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,600
I was thinking a skeleman.

32
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,620
I was thinking...

33
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,300
A pumpkin.

34
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,840
I was thinking...

35
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,520
Whatever we want.

36
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,740
The cookie... I got an amount for...

37
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,680
It was like...

38
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,620
An amount of like 24 cookies.

39
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,060
The secret ingredient is pent of anger.

40
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,160
No, I have a whisk!

41
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,010
I have a whisk!

42
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,430
I have a whisk!

43
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,130
I have a whisk!

44
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,530
I'm not gonna use my fists.

45
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,970
Don't worry!

46
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,030
Did you get any specific cookie cutters?

47
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,190
No, no, no.

48
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,630
Cookie cutter?

49
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,570
No, no, no.

50
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,310
Today is...

51
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,910
Today is from my sheer brilliance.

52
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,290
Of course.

53
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,450
Of course, of course.

54
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,110
So, hello!

55
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,650
Hello, hello, hello, hello!

56
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,050
Minto shaped cookies.

57
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,370
Ghostly hands.

58
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,090
So spooky, huh?

59
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,430
Did you hear about the B.A.

60
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,110
Idol event?

61
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,310
Idol Mari Reel.

62
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,470
Wait, no I haven't.

63
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,450
But some of these things...

64
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,490
Are...

65
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:43,770
Look.

66
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,430
Maybe ghost...

67
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,350
Materials.

68
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,490
So, you know.

69
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,170
Even Boo...

70
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,290
He only shows up in certain ways.

71
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,450
But Chibi Minto...

72
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,490
We got a ghost on film.

73
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,570
The invisible man.

74
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,450
Except the invisible maid...

75
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,450
Yeah!

76
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,810
Spooky, huh?

77
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:14,890
Yeah!

78
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,730
So...

79
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,330
We will be baking.

80
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,510
And I'll be doing my best.

81
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,640
I'm scared because...

82
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:23,910
Honestly...

83
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,570
Okay, so...

84
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,470
My desk is...

85
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,190
Over here.

86
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,210
And...

87
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,770
So I have to like turn to the side.

88
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,470
For...

89
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:31,930
Baking.

90
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,270
Hopefully I have enough space.

91
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,110
In fact, I'm gonna move the Hershey's.

92
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,350
Chocolate.

93
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,670
But I got chocolate...

94
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,750
For...

95
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,950
For cookies.

96
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,250
Actually, right now...

97
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,310
Oh gosh.

98
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,670
Right now...

99
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,350
The butter is not yet...

100
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,030
Oh!

101
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,930
I was gonna say it's not yet soft.

102
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,130
But I think it's pretty soft.

103
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,650
Hi, Cookie Minto.

104
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,530
Friendly reminder that raw flour and raw egg can be dangerous.

105
00:06:59,010 --> 00:06:59,390
Okay.

106
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,350
But we're cooking it.

107
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,690
Oh my gosh!

108
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,250
My egg!

109
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,010
Oh, I didn't bring my egg in here.

110
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,390
I have to go get an egg.

111
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,330
Why are her hands like that?

112
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,010
You're pretty cool, Minto.

113
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,630
Thank you.

114
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,270
What's happening?

115
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,790
Why is it weird now?

116
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,670
As soon as I...

117
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,290
What the hell?

118
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,330
What happened?

119
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,830
Did I move my table on accident?

120
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,510
Hold on.

121
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,050
Don't look.

122
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,310
Why is it so scuffed?

123
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,630
I'm literally gonna become the Joker.

124
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,050
I'm going to become the Joker.

125
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:40,990
Anyway...

126
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,980
Good job.

127
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,700
We live in a society.

128
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,120
I worked so hard!

129
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,460
I'm gonna go get my egg.

130
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,680
Oh, hold on.

131
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Before I do that...

132
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,940
I've got my bowl.

133
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,820
I've got my bowl.

134
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,180
And I'm gonna fill it.

135
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,000
Hold on.

136
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,320
I have like a...

137
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,020
I have...

138
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,780
I have a pre-thing of...

139
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,490
Of baking flour.

140
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,850
And stuff.

141
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,470
Hold on.

142
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,270
Let me pour that in.

143
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,170
Oh, shoot.

144
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,130
Oh, it didn't open it.

145
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,610
Is the music too loud, by the way?

146
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,170
Just let me know.

147
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,640
I ripped it open, but...

148
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,360
I ripped it open, but it didn't work.

149
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,900
What?

150
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,080
I ripped it open, but it's still not open.

151
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,020
The little lines was a lie.

152
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,100
Okay, hold on.

153
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,520
I'm gonna use my teeth.

154
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,460
Hold on.

155
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,500
I don't have any scissors with me.

156
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,340
Hold on.

157
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,180
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

158
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,680
Nice.

159
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,970
It's getting everywhere.

160
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,830
Chibi Minto, don't get dusty, okay?

161
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,990
I think that's enough.

162
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:52,910
Oh, hold on.

163
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
There we go.

164
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,360
It's kind of dusty.

165
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,220
It doesn't look like a cookie.

166
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,440
We're baking the cookies.

167
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,460
What are you talking about?

168
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,080
What are you talking about?

169
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,700
Okay, now I stir it.

170
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,280
Oh my gosh.

171
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,460
I feel so homely right now.

172
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,800
I feel so homely right now.

173
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,260
Nice stealth camo.

174
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,810
Bacon is...

175
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,700
Bacon...

176
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,740
It's actually a bacon.

177
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,100
Like pecan, pecan, it's bacon.

178
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,560
It's a whole different...

179
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,380
stream of...

180
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,810
Okay, so this is...

181
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,850
This is prepared, basically.

182
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,970
I also have my butter.

183
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,630
Okay, let's put in our butter.

184
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,110
Wait, hold on.

185
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:39,850
Let me read the instructions.

186
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,490
I'm scared.

187
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,670
Okay, I have my oven preheated.

188
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,050
Stir the cookie...

189
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,310
butter...

190
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,790
vanilla egg.

191
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,610
Okay.

192
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,090
Okay.

193
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,650
Oh my gosh.

194
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,650
I'm gonna do like half of the butter and then...

195
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,050
Hopefully my butter is soft enough.

196
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,870
Meeting my first candy cane.

197
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,930
What are you talking about?

198
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,270
It's not candy cane time.

199
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,230
Google the definition of homely real quick.

200
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,470
Wait, what does that mean?

201
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,370
What does a homely mean?

202
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,100
I got it a little bit on me, but that's okay.

203
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,760
Oh my gosh.

204
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,720
Do you guys want to see the most tragic thing ever?

205
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:31,940
So...

206
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,800
So...

207
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,500
I have this...

208
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,140
I have this cup that I've had for a long time.

209
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,700
It's not even that long though.

210
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,280
I've had mugs that were longer.

211
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,080
Right?

212
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,860
I've had mugs that were around longer.

213
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,760
And they never...

214
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,080
This never happened to them.

215
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,140
But okay, so I have this...

216
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,080
This Idol Master Koume.

217
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:53,960
Koume...

218
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,940
Idol Master Cinderella Girls.

219
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,080
Koume is like...

220
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,960
She's like the spooky ghost member, you know?

221
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,940
She's like very spooky.

222
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,420
So, you know, I love...

223
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,740
I love anything spooky, you know?

224
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,260
But...

225
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,120
She...

226
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
This has never happened to a mug of mine before ever.

227
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Look at this!

228
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,880
This is not just...

229
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,560
Look at this!

230
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,960
Look how...

231
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,420
How...

232
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,500
Faded away it is!

233
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,980
It's the most faded mug I've ever had in my life.

234
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,700
My afterlife.

235
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,220
This never happened before to me.

236
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,760
And I've had it for a while, but like not that long.

237
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,420
I put it in the dishwasher, but this never happened to any of my other mugs before.

238
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,220
It's in character for her, but I can barely even read...

239
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,300
It says like...

240
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,380
Team Cool.

241
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,140
Age 13.

242
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,300
Birthday March 28?

243
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,720
I think that's what it says.

244
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,840
Zodiac sign Aries.

245
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,700
Blood type AB, but you can barely...

246
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,980
I have to squint to read it.

247
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,080
Still usable.

248
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,680
Yeah, but it makes me so sad.

249
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,580
It's like...

250
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,300
She's...

251
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,060
She's...

252
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,720
She's disappearing.

253
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,520
She's disappearing.

254
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,800
Okay.

255
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,220
We put in our butter.

256
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,580
I don't think it's...

257
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,320
Soft enough.

258
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,470
Hold on.

259
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,010
Come out.

260
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,530
Okay, hold on.

261
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:36,770
Hold on.

262
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,430
Wait, I can't get it out.

263
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,490
I feel like I'm digging in sand right now.

264
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,250
What can I find?

265
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,550
I feel like I'm like...

266
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,230
This is cat litter box simulator.

267
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,070
How do I get it out?

268
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:57,930
A spoon?

269
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,930
I have a spoon.

270
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,470
Where do I put that?

271
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,650
Okay, I'll put it in the mug.

272
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,950
It's stuck in there!

273
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,810
I guess it's in jail.

274
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,390
That's the jailed butter.

275
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,360
It'll get stirred around eventually.

276
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,700
Probably once I add the egg, it'll become more...

277
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,860
What else do I need to add?

278
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,320
I need to add...

279
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,000
One teaspoon of vanilla.

280
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,580
How much is a teaspoon?

281
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,260
If I just dump it in there, I think it's fine.

282
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,330
Oh, I smell it.

283
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,150
It smells so good.

284
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,150
Like, how much is a teaspoon?

285
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,870
One cap?

286
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,580
You think that's enough?

287
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,550
That's enough?

288
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,330
It smells so good though.

289
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,990
I want my cookies to smell delicious.

290
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,370
Did I change my favorite ringtone?

291
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,750
What did I make?

292
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,770
Are you sure this is enough?

293
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,070
It's not wet at all.

294
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,850
It's so dry.

295
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,210
How am I supposed to make a dough out of this, you guys?

296
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,190
How am I supposed to shape the cookies?

297
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,650
Okay, I forgot my egg in the fridge.

298
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,310
Oh, I forgot also.

299
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,510
I have icing for decorating after.

300
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,030
I have a cookie icing.

301
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,990
Was the butter supposed to be melted?

302
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:10,050
I said melted, but soft is also melted.

303
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,470
It didn't say to what degree of meltation.

304
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,770
Sorry, Pies is in my room.

305
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,010
Softer.

306
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,390
Did you put in cold butter?

307
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:29,810
No!

308
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,190
It was definitely squishy.

309
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,590
It may smell good, but if you add too much vanilla, it's going to ruin it.

310
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,310
It's okay, guys.

311
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,510
I'm not going to put in anymore.

312
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,110
It's okay.

313
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,810
Lampy, thank you for the gift.

314
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,070
Thank you.

315
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,050
It kind of looks like melted vanilla ice cream at the moment.

316
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,590
It looks very sandy on my end.

317
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,850
Looks quite sandy.

318
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,730
Use a spatula to stir.

319
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,630
Oh, really?

320
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,430
Okay.

321
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,950
I'm going to go get those things from my kitchen.

322
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,550
The maid cafe kitchen is fully stocked.

323
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,330
I just don't go in there, because I'm a maid cafe maid.

324
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,410
I don't go into the kitchen.

325
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,690
They hand me the food, and then I present it to the guests.

326
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,910
I've never stepped foot in that kitchen before, actually.

327
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,910
Maybe once.

328
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,370
Should I just use my hands?

329
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,850
I think I should use my hands to mix it instead.

330
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,660
Get the egg.

331
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,980
Oh, let me go get my egg.

332
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,960
I'll be right back.

333
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,040
It will probably melt, because my room is so hot.

334
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,920
Everybody!

335
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,040
Okay, collectively...

336
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,680
Start putting, like, fire emoji in the chat.

337
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,720
And it will warm up everything.

338
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,520
Okay, it will melt my butter.

339
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,720
I'll be right back.

340
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,610
I have returned.

341
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,030
It's kind of off, but don't worry about it.

342
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,470
I have returned with a spatula.

343
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,070
And...

344
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,890
An egg!

345
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,410
What if I crushed it?

346
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,890
What if I just...

347
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,370
And just let it seep through my fingers?

348
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,730
What if I...

349
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,490
And then a spatula.

350
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,630
Which kind of looks like a knife.

351
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,690
Are your hands strong enough?

352
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,370
Resist the monkey, resist the crush.

353
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,150
Oh my gosh.

354
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,470
I keep gripping it like I'm really gonna do it.

355
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,710
I'm gonna do it!

356
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,750
I'm gonna do it!

357
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,400
This is like the smallest spatula ever.

358
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,420
What are you talking about?

359
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,380
This is so normal!

360
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,660
This is so fun.

361
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,960
Oh shoot.

362
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,700
Oh gosh.

363
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,940
Oh my god, that worked.

364
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay, I'm gonna put it in the... Hold on, I need to move the butter.

365
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,000
Where can I put this butter?

366
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,040
Like the butter packaging.

367
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,750
Like this.

368
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,810
Oops, I got some on me.

369
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,600
I have an idea.

370
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,840
I'll put it in that container.

371
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,240
There we go, I'm all good.

372
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,100
Okay, time to crack an egg!

373
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,040
You gotta break an egg to make an omelette, but we're not making an omelette, we're making...

374
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,480
Cookies!

375
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,940
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

376
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm gonna do it like Ray.

377
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,580
Okay.

378
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,910
Nice crack.

379
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,310
Nice crack.

380
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,830
We did that.

381
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,390
We did that.

382
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:21,910
Alright.

383
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,010
Oh, spatula.

384
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,540
I'm stabbing, I'm stabbing, I'm stabbing.

385
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,320
Alright, let's absorb.

386
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,580
Oh my god!

387
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
It's turning into dough!

388
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,840
We're doing it!

389
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,500
We're doing it!

390
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,910
It's really dusty.

391
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,870
Get out of there.

392
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,090
Get out of there.

393
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,290
We're okay.

394
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:02,870
Everything's fine.

395
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,470
Use force.

396
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,450
I'm using force, I'm using force.

397
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:09,710
Force.

398
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,090
Everything keeps getting stuck in the whisk.

399
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,630
This is the worst thing ever.

400
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,750
Who invented this thing?

401
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,670
I'm gonna go back in time and tell them to fix their creation.

402
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,650
Never patent this.

403
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:35,950
Ever.

404
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,210
This thing sucks.

405
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,090
This is the worst invention ever!

406
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,000
Use chopsticks.

407
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,000
You're not meant to use a whisk for that.

408
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,380
Yes you are.

409
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,760
Literally every baker has a whisk.

410
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,200
Duh.

411
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,160
Just use your hands?

412
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,550
Maybe.

413
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,210
Maybe I should just use my hands.

414
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,650
Alright everybody.

415
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,590
It's time for the ghost.

416
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,570
Hand special.

417
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,270
We're getting handsy.

418
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,390
Oh boy.

419
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,750
You guys just don't appreciate my art!

420
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,150
What's wrong with my art everybody?

421
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,150
Gosh.

422
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,310
You just don't appreciate it.

423
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,890
Oh I washed my hands.

424
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,330
I washed them.

425
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,110
Don't worry, don't worry.

426
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,110
I keep thinking I'm hearing a cat and it's my cat, but I think it's the BGM.

427
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,450
Alright, I'm just gonna leave this like right here.

428
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,890
Chibi Minto, watch out.

429
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,410
Thank you!

430
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,470
The great Minto Bake Off.

431
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,190
Alright, here we go.

432
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,170
Time to squish it!

433
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,030
I'm nervous!

434
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,830
Wait, I'm scared.

435
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,810
Is this really what bakers do?

436
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,110
Okay.

437
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,570
Okay.

438
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,850
Okay.

439
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,550
I'm going in.

440
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,410
I'm scared.

441
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,090
Okay.

442
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,990
It's a rite of passage.

443
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,170
Okay.

444
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,650
Here we go.

445
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,820
It's getting on my hands a little.

446
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,500
Okay!

447
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,900
We're making progress!

448
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,000
I have to make the dough to make the cookies.

449
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,000
It's okay.

450
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,700
Everybody is...

451
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,900
I'm throwing it at myself.

452
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,960
We're okay.

453
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,700
How do I make it so the other dust gets in with the butter and everything else?

454
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,680
Because my hands are fine!

455
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,500
It's fine!

456
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,580
Don't worry about it!

457
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,380
Okay.

458
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,040
We're still going.

459
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,120
It's still really sandy.

460
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,060
Keep squishing it.

461
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,400
I have to be like a cat.

462
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,310
Like a play-doh.

463
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:53,730
Oh my god.

464
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,530
Oh my god.

465
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:55,910
Oh my god.

466
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,790
It's messy.

467
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,650
Please squish together!

468
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,210
You're family!

469
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,010
You're gonna get baked together!

470
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,150
And it'll taste so good, probably.

471
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,070
Yeah!

472
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,910
Okay.

473
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:14,790
What if I...

474
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,270
Oh, hold on.

475
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,610
I'm gonna make a patty.

476
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,990
And then I'm gonna put all...

477
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,050
I'm gonna put all the sand inside.

478
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,390
And then...

479
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,050
And then bury it alive.

480
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,370
It's like, okay.

481
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,310
Yeah.

482
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,130
Oh my gosh.

483
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,130
Okay, okay, okay.

484
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,650
Now I roll it.

485
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,050
That didn't work as I intended, but...

486
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,790
Why does it look so dry?

487
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,870
I don't know!

488
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,430
It's just...

489
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,050
What have

490
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,210
I...

491
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,470
I hope these don't...

492
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,010
You guys, I forgot the chocolate chips.

493
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,050
I forgot the chocolate chips.

494
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,890
The most important part.

495
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,470
We're making chocolate chip cookies.

496
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:06,770
It's okay.

497
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,090
It's just like I've been to the beach.

498
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,670
A little bit.

499
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:12,730
Okay.

500
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,070
Milk?

501
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,810
No, that's not what the recipe calls for.

502
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,810
I'm following the recipe!

503
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,710
I'm so glad I put stuff down on my floor.

504
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,910
So that if I make a mess...

505
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,810
It catches it.

506
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,150
Okay.

507
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,290
Alright.

508
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,430
I don't know how much a cup is.

509
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,890
Maybe like that much.

510
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,850
Maybe.

511
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,090
More?

512
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,210
Less?

513
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,430
Maybe like that much.

514
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,450
Maybe.

515
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:51,750
More.

516
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:55,750
Sand!

517
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,210
I feel like...

518
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:57,610
Oh my gosh.

519
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,110
I feel like those commercials of the children that get those sandy...

520
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,290
Like...

521
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,270
Oh my gosh.

522
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,430
It's still so sandy.

523
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,710
Those...

524
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,110
Moon sand!

525
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,230
Yes!

526
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,110
You okay, Chibi Minto?

527
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,810
She says yep.

528
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,410
All good, baby.

529
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,490
All good.

530
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,210
How we doing, everybody?

531
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,490
So then after we do this...

532
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,590
After we do this, we'll shape it...

533
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,310
Into fun shapes.

534
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,770
And they'll bake...

535
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,850
And they'll become those shapes.

536
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,570
I think I'm gonna make a 3D witch.

537
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,490
If I make a cookie that's standing up...

538
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,310
Like...

539
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,490
Like yay high...

540
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,650
With a hat and everything.

541
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,650
How will it cook?

542
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,390
Today we'll find out.

543
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,470
It will work.

544
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,570
What if I put toothpicks in it?

545
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,530
It will melt?

546
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,410
No, no, no.

547
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,370
What if I put toothpicks in it?

548
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,870
Are you tempted to eat the cookie dough right away?

549
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:16,410
No.

550
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,230
I'm squishing it.

551
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,690
I'm tempted to...

552
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,530
Wait, this is actually becoming so good.

553
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,190
Look guys, it's a real dough.

554
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,610
The character of steam dolls.

555
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,570
Oh, I have heard about that.

556
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,680
We have dough!

557
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,300
We have liftoff!

558
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,340
Yeah!

559
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,900
Oh, it's a little...

560
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,760
Oh god, hold on.

561
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,220
It's still a little dry.

562
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,560
It's okay though.

563
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,990
Also, you guys kept saying gloves.

564
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,230
These are my hands, so...

565
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,470
Rude.

566
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,410
You probably just think I have such pretty hands...

567
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,570
That it looks like gloves.

568
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,470
But it's not.

569
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,310
It's actually my hands.

570
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:24,170
You know?

571
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,330
I'm a ghost.

572
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,450
Yeah!

573
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,010
Oh my gosh!

574
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,130
Real dough!

575
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,150
Guys, we did it!

576
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,230
We did it!

577
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,220
Okay, this was truly a trust the process sort of moment.

578
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,320
This is truly a trust the process.

579
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,520
But wait, did you guys trust?

580
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,740
Did you guys trust?

581
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,820
Alright.

582
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,060
Next, I have to transfer...

583
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,120
Hold on, what if I get everything off of this?

584
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,300
Take that.

585
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,200
Let's get everything in here.

586
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,810
Get out.

587
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,990
Get out and smoosh.

588
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,520
Smoosh.

589
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,930
You guys trusted the process.

590
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,110
Uh-oh, there's cat hair.

591
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,250
Uh-oh.

592
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,570
Don't worry about it.

593
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,670
I won't use that bit.

594
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,480
Guys, this is just what happens when you live with a cat, okay?

595
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,280
It's literally cat hair everywhere, okay?

596
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,700
You have to understand.

597
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,180
It gives it kick.

598
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,500
Okay, now I should have...

599
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,220
Oh, what is this?

600
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,840
I got stuff on me.

601
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,880
Okay, I think it's butter.

602
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,920
Now that I have this, I'm gonna put these away.

603
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,440
Don't need my whisk or my spatula anymore.

604
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,100
In fact, I didn't need them to begin with.

605
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,890
You guys are gonna be so excited to see this.

606
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:41,970
I have...

607
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,130
Hold on, I gotta open it.

608
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,590
Here we go.

609
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,060
I have special plates that we can put our cookies on before I put them on the pan.

610
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,900
So I can get rid of my bowl.

611
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,100
Wait.

612
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,940
Let me just take...

613
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,240
I'm just gonna move it.

614
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,420
Alright.

615
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,010
Okay.

616
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,720
Yeah!

617
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,060
Yeah!

618
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,000
Happy Halloween!

619
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,080
Yeah!

620
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,900
Happy Halloween!

621
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,910
Okay, oh wait.

622
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,410
So now we're gonna start making one...

623
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,690
One cookie at a time.

624
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,470
Pick number three, my lord.

625
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,550
My lord.

626
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:07,950
Okay,

627
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,660
I'm gonna put... We're gonna do it in little chunks at a time.

628
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,860
So this is our first cookie chunk.

629
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,820
And the rest goes on another plate.

630
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,480
Then I have to find a place to let it sit.

631
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,500
Oh, no.

632
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,380
That's my mic.

633
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,540
There we go.

634
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,060
Alright.

635
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,240
So, we have our cookie chunk.

636
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,640
What kind of first cookie should we make?

637
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,300
It could be a bat.

638
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,580
It could be a ghost.

639
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,760
It could be a witch.

640
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,300
It could be a pumpkin.

641
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,480
It could be anything.

642
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,260
A spider?

643
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,580
A wisp?

644
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,140
Okay.

645
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,060
It could be anything we want!

646
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,600
The world is our oyster, but I'm not making that.

647
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,040
Should we do a wisp first?

648
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,740
Okay.

649
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,220
Alright.

650
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,200
This one's gonna be easy though, right?

651
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,600
Okay, he's got a little bit of a thing there.

652
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,240
My genius will guide us to victory in this turn.

653
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,840
So it's like that.

654
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,860
Just like that, right?

655
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,200
And he's got little cat ears.

656
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,960
Yep, there we go.

657
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,220
One ear.

658
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,200
Oh my gosh!

659
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,240
This looks so good!

660
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,020
This looks so good!

661
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,340
Oh, is it too chunky?

662
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,080
It's okay, I gotta have a big chunk to spread out.

663
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,020
Or to... Here, see?

664
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,620
Like this.

665
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,440
See?

666
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,160
He becomes bigger.

667
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,300
And we need more... We need the material.

668
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,780
See?

669
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,300
It looks just like you guys!

670
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,100
It's gotta have a tip.

671
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,620
I think that'll fry off.

672
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,060
Nah.

673
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,150
Okay.

674
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:04,930
It's gonna be raw?

675
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,250
Okay, I have to tear you in half, guys.

676
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,430
We can't have it be raw.

677
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:13,430
Redo.

678
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,890
Redo.

679
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,250
Redo.

680
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,670
Good base.

681
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,930
This is a good base.

682
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,280
Like that.

683
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:28,700
Okay.

684
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,940
Now, from here...

685
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,920
From here, that's like your ear.

686
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,520
Hold on, parts of it are getting on me.

687
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,240
Okay.

688
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,760
See?

689
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,140
Can't believe she ripped us in half.

690
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,020
I've done it before and I'll do it again.

691
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,100
Okay.

692
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,060
And how am I supposed to form your ears?

693
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,660
If I don't have enough dough!

694
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,180
Oh wait, just like that.

695
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,800
You guys are coming apart in my hands a little bit.

696
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,860
It's okay.

697
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,060
I'll cradle you.

698
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,040
I'll cradle you.

699
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,580
Just like that!

700
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,380
Oh my gosh, it looks so good actually!

701
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,800
Do a rolling pin and knife?

702
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,320
No.

703
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,460
No.

704
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,040
I don't have space for that really.

705
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,280
Okay, now I'm gonna give you guys eyes.

706
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,490
How do I do your mouth?

707
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,680
V-shape?

708
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,080
Okay.

709
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,760
Like that?

710
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,500
Like that!

711
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,320
It's cute, right?

712
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,800
It's cute, right?

713
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,460
Yeah!

714
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,100
Okay, what's wrong with your eye?

715
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,080
What are you talking about?

716
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,560
Oh my precious little wisp.

717
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,520
Oh my gosh.

718
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,940
I'm gonna bake you up and I'm gonna eat you.

719
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,520
Okay, that's one cookie down.

720
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,140
That was easy though.

721
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,880
That was an easy cookie.

722
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
I need to transfer him to a plate.

723
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,840
Oh wait, maybe to the cooking... baking pan.

724
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,460
I have no more space.

725
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,240
I'm afraid of putting it where I want to put it.

726
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,620
Because I think pies will try to eat it.

727
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,280
Are you calling wisps simple or something?

728
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,780
No, no, no,

729
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,140
no.

730
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,660
Just put it on the baking sheet?

731
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,880
Yeah, but I don't have a place to put the baking sheet.

732
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,220
Currently it's up sideways against...

733
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,640
Here, actually I'll keep it in my lap.

734
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,120
Come here.

735
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,160
Come here.

736
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,860
Come here.

737
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,260
Okay, say goodbye.

738
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,820
Next time you see him, he'll be a fully fledged cookie.

739
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,720
Oh man.

740
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,640
Wow!

741
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,100
Okay, alright, next.

742
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,180
Oh, okay, I can't work in these conditions.

743
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,520
I caved immediately.

744
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,460
Hold on, I didn't...

745
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,120
Okay,

746
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:14,980
we're good.

747
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Alright, what should we shape next?

748
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,580
I'm thinking maybe a skelly... a skelly-ton.

749
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,320
How do you guys think?

750
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,180
A skelly-ton.

751
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,840
A skelly-ton.

752
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,200
Spooky!

753
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,700
Okay, this... Oh my gosh!

754
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,540
I basically made a skelly-ton.

755
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:44,820
Wait!

756
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,520
Am I a genius?

757
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,640
Do you see it?

758
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,680
I basically already made one.

759
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,820
Oh my gosh.

760
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,480
Oh my god.

761
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,420
Okay, hold on.

762
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh.

763
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:04,880
It's a skelly-ton with a lobotomy, which doesn't make much sense, cause...

764
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,320
You know.

765
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,040
Cause skelly-tons don't have brains.

766
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,420
But...

767
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,580
Okay, for this one we're gonna call out our trusty spatula.

768
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:20,370
Perfect!

769
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:21,750
Okay, hold on.

770
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:21,870
Hold on.

771
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:28,930
Trust the process!

772
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:31,970
Trust the process.

773
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,550
I gotta get my little finger in there.

774
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,390
I just gotta...

775
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,630
I just gotta do this a little bit in their eyes.

776
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,350
Oh my gosh!

777
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,790
Okay, good.

778
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,920
Hold on, it's a little lopsided.

779
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,300
Actually that looks pretty good.

780
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,220
What do you guys think?

781
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,700
What do you guys think?

782
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,980
It's pretty good.

783
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,660
It looks good.

784
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,420
Where's the skeleton teeth?

785
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,500
I'm not there yet!

786
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,320
I'm not there yet.

787
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,320
That's where the spatula comes in.

788
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,780
Kinda looks like Cthulhu.

789
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,920
Kinda looks like Cthulhu.

790
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,420
It's pretty cute though, right?

791
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,460
It's okay that his head is lumpy.

792
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,420
It's like a lumpy skull, just like mine.

793
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,100
That I used to have.

794
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,840
I see Cthulhu.

795
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,380
Cthulhu's spooky too though.

796
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,040
I think it's okay.

797
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,610
I'm digging out his eye holes.

798
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,830
Hold on, I gotta get there with a personal touch.

799
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:14,620
Okay.

800
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,180
Alright, let's move him to the cookie pan.

801
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,620
Say goodbye.

802
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,240
To our guy, say goodbye.

803
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,400
To Freddy Fazbear.

804
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,980
Okay, we can do Freddy Fazbear.

805
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:48,830
Okay.

806
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,090
Alright, time for Freddy Fazbear.

807
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,630
I don't have a reference picture, so it will be Freddy Fazbear from memory.

808
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,150
Thank you!

809
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:12,490
Sorry that Chibi Minto is becoming a little more ghostly.

810
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,570
As time goes on.

811
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:15,730
Chibi Minto, are you okay?

812
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:17,670
There you go.

813
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,250
She says, I'm fine.

814
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:21,710
Don't worry about me.

815
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,970
I'm just traveling through inter...

816
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,010
Oh, I probably shouldn't touch her with my gloves.

817
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,590
That's okay, Chibi Minto needs a shower anyway.

818
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:31,770
Okay.

819
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,670
Freddy Fazbear!

820
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:35,690
Freddy Fazbear from memory.

821
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:37,850
Freddy Fazbear has a hat.

822
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:40,470
Freddy Fazbear has a bow tie.

823
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:44,010
Freddy Fazbear has a...

824
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:46,970
What gloves?

825
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,530
Oh, the gloves that I have on my hand for touching all this stuff.

826
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,030
You guys, these are my real hands, but of course I'm wearing gloves.

827
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,050
I'm wearing rubber gloves right now.

828
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,790
You just can't see them.

829
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:00,490
They're ghosts.

830
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:02,590
Ghost gloves.

831
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:05,830
The real GGs.

832
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,690
What, do you think I'm some kind of monster?

833
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,590
Touching this without any protection?

834
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,730
Who do you... I mean, I am a monster, but who do you take me for?

835
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:17,910
Dead.

836
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:25,970
Dead.

837
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,720
Okay.

838
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,260
Freddy Fazbear.

839
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,940
If I wasn't making a sentence of Freddy Fazbear, this would be such a good looking cookie.

840
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,780
Hi, Pies!

841
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,780
You're looking at the cookie.

842
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,800
Wait, did you... Why are you licking your lips?

843
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,550
I think the cookies are safe.

844
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,980
Are you good?

845
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:05,380
Yeah?

846
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,520
You're being a licky, licky girl.

847
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,120
Okay, I think we're okay.

848
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,060
Jack from Nightmare Before Christmas?

849
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,840
We just did a skeleton, though.

850
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,880
Okay, I think we're fine.

851
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,420
I think it's fine.

852
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,740
Alright, Freddy Fazbear.

853
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,460
Corin, thank you!

854
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,160
That was a little Corin.

855
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,980
We would have a big spooky Halloween party with decorations and a smoke machine.

856
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,940
With all the other kids, the big event at the end was decorating Halloween sugar cookies.

857
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,620
So Halloween cookies are part of my core memory.

858
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,800
Happy that I can help out.

859
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,740
Okay, I'm gonna lobotomize Freddy Fazbear.

860
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,260
This is our base Freddy.

861
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,940
This is the base Freddy.

862
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,260
Also, once we put the cookies in the oven, maybe I'll show you guys.

863
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,040
Pause, okay?

864
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,360
Oh, nose, ear.

865
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,200
Ears and a nose.

866
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,480
Yeah, yeah, he has those too.

867
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,640
Okay, this is gonna be our hat.

868
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,640
This is gonna be our top hat.

869
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,160
It's gotta be flat and big.

870
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,500
Oh my goodness.

871
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,640
Does that look like a top hat to you guys?

872
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,500
Does that look good?

873
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,220
Pies reveal.

874
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,400
Does this look good to you guys?

875
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,480
Yeah?

876
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,680
Perfect?

877
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:53,300
Good.

878
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,080
It's looking just like him!

879
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,980
Oh my gosh, and I already have the ears kind of poking out here.

880
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,160
Everybody say whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore, whore.

881
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,240
Now for Freddy's ears and nose, we're gonna have to...

882
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,020
We're gonna have to give him some chocolates.

883
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:37,110
This might be Glamrock Freddy because he's already looking so fabulous.

884
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,370
Oh my gosh!

885
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,420
He's looking good.

886
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,340
He's looking good.

887
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,500
Wait, what?

888
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,320
Freddy Fazbear has a big ol' smile.

889
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,320
Spatula time.

890
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,990
Oh yeah!

891
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,990
No, this is a spatula, not a knife.

892
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,870
Oh yeah, baby.

893
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:37,970
Freddy Fazbear is ready for some children's entertainment.

894
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,350
Whore, whore, whore, whore.

895
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:43,530
You can tell it's him, right?

896
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,250
Yeah, you can tell it's Freddy Fazbear.

897
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,850
Whore, whore, whore, whore, whore.

898
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,480
Okay, say goodbye to Freddy Fazbear.

899
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,140
Bye Freddy.

900
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,840
He's going to the...

901
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,380
He's going to the cookie pan.

902
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,200
Guys, I think I only have enough room on my cookie pan for like six cookies.

903
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,460
So we'll do six and then we'll bake them up, baby.

904
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,600
Hold on.

905
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,380
I gotta use the spatula to get them off.

906
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:22,480
Hold on.

907
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,630
He's really fragile.

908
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,410
Freddy!

909
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,060
Before I bake them, I'll fix them up.

910
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,660
Don't worry.

911
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,120
Perfect Paddington.

912
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,560
No Paddington!

913
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:48,350
Casualty!

914
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:49,870
Casualty!

915
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:15,370
We're good.

916
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:16,470
We're good.

917
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:17,630
We're good.

918
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,830
We're good.

919
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,830
We're good.

920
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,010
We're good.

921
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:22,670
Let's get some more dough, baby.

922
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:25,530
Okay.

923
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:27,950
I got my dough.

924
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:29,590
What should we make?

925
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,510
A bat?

926
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,010
Okay, we can do a bat.

927
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:47,900
Hiya!

928
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:48,580
Hiya!

929
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,300
Hiya!

930
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:49,940
Hiya!

931
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,000
Paz is watching like, what the hell are you doing?

932
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,880
You're so cute, little girl.

933
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,380
You're so cute.

934
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,100
Okay.

935
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,300
Here is a bat.

936
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,280
So far.

937
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,840
Alright, this one we're actually going to cut out.

938
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,400
I know I said I was going to go off on my sheer genius before, but this time we're cutting.

939
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,340
Oh boy.

940
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,240
This is why I didn't cut before.

941
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,360
It looks like stupid ass.

942
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,640
God dammit.

943
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,260
What does a bat look like?

944
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:30,820
Okay, hold on.

945
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,080
I have an image.

946
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,160
He's got little ears.

947
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,280
Okay.

948
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,860
Like that?

949
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:48,210
Okay.

950
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,270
Oh, thanks for the references, you guys.

951
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,920
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

952
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,400
Okay, okay.

953
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,840
It might have, like, not a lot of body.

954
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:04,840
But that's okay.

955
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,640
Bats come in all shapes and sizes.

956
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,760
And he's got to have a little butt body.

957
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,340
Yeah, I can add that in with the extra.

958
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:36,120
Okay, it's a little rough.

959
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,520
But when we get him out of the oven...

960
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:53,040
When we get him out of the oven, we'll decorate him with some icing.

961
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,320
Really

962
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,030
nicely here.

963
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,230
To let everybody know that he's a friendly guy.

964
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,610
We'll give him a big ol' face.

965
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,940
Kind of looks like the Mothman.

966
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,560
Real

967
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:41,350
tears.

968
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,260
I think he'll bake into his body, you know?

969
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:58,400
He's not looking so great right now, but...

970
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,060
It's kind of like when a kid is ugly and has a little bit of a glow up.

971
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,320
I think that's what will happen.

972
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,220
Yeah, he's a grower.

973
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,260
He's a grower.

974
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,700
He's a grower.

975
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,900
Bake these cookies until they're boneless.

976
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,380
They don't have bones already.

977
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,480
Oh my gosh.

978
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,360
I'm crying real tears.

979
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,900
Oh, you can't see.

980
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,660
You can't see.

981
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:28,320
Okay.

982
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,220
Alright, everybody say goodbye to Batman.

983
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,780
Mothman.

984
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:34,560
Batman.

985
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,880
Everybody say goodbye.

986
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,580
He's going to the...

987
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,200
Neocraft!

988
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:39,400
Thank you for the deck gift.

989
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,160
Thank you.

990
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,980
He's going to the baking sheet.

991
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,780
Just got my nails in your color.

992
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,800
Thank you.

993
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,560
Bye bye.

994
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,080
Bye Batman.

995
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:52,740
Bye Batman.

996
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,760
Next time you see him, he'll be really big and strong.

997
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:57,380
Getting

998
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,930
these guys off the plate is like impossible.

999
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:14,630
What

1000
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:36,020
is our next cookie design?

1001
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,780
Did you grease the baking sheet?

1002
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,240
It doesn't say to... Oh yeah.

1003
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:54,500
Place two inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.

1004
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,400
It's okay.

1005
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,000
The direction says ungreased.

1006
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:15,990
What is this?

1007
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:16,890
What is that?

1008
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,890
That's cookie dough.

1009
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:21,610
Yeah, little girl.

1010
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:22,570
She's so curious.

1011
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,510
She's just been non-stop staring.

1012
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:29,850
She loves to jump on top of high places.

1013
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,310
And I had a box.

1014
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:36,330
Actually, the box that someone gifted me from Off-Kai.

1015
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:38,310
It was like the Minto love box.

1016
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:44,630
I had that set up with a bag on top of it and she would like run and jump on top of it and everything.

1017
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:48,550
But she started... It started to break.

1018
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:54,030
Because of how aggressive she was jumping on top of it because she was so excited about it.

1019
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,930
And so now she has a smaller box.

1020
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,830
I feel really bad.

1021
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,830
But she just loves jumping on top of like a box.

1022
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,810
She's such a good girl.

1023
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:05,970
Does she have a scratching post?

1024
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,470
She has multiple scratching posts.

1025
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:08,710
Ashes!

1026
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:13,710
It means I love you but I'm starting to lose faith in the process.

1027
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:14,030
Why?

1028
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:16,530
Why?

1029
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:17,170
Why?

1030
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,270
Hold on.

1031
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:22,050
This pumpkin will convince you otherwise.

1032
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,330
This is gonna be a grand pumpkin.

1033
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,230
Hold on, first we gotta get into pumpkin shape.

1034
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:33,230
Tip-top pumpkin shape.

1035
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:36,690
Look how delicate I'm being like a real baker.

1036
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,390
Oh, that's a pumpkin shape.

1037
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,950
I'm ready to be a believer.

1038
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:49,090
Believers in the chat, rise up!

1039
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:50,890
Believers in the chat.

1040
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:59,390
Oh my god, if this were like a done cookie, it would look kind of insane.

1041
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:00,590
But it's not.

1042
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:01,730
It's not supposed to be normal.

1043
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:02,450
It's supposed to be a pumpkin.

1044
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:11,230
So we're gonna... We're gonna inject... We're gonna indent, I mean, sorry, English.

1045
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:15,810
We're gonna... make him even more lumpy.

1046
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,410
And then we're also gonna add a little tuft at the top.

1047
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,890
And then I saw her bake.

1048
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:25,010
You're the greatest baker I've ever witnessed.

1049
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:26,550
Thanks, Tia!

1050
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,650
See, Tia knows who owns her.

1051
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:31,490
Okay.

1052
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,680
That looks like a pumpkin.

1053
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,080
Should we do one?

1054
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,800
Maybe the... What expression should we do?

1055
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,840
Let's... Okay, first we gotta do triangle eyes.

1056
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:03,670
It's hard with the... It's really hard with the...

1057
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:05,210
Cook... Chocolate chips in there.

1058
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,310
Because it makes it really lumpy.

1059
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,550
So it's honestly not even my fault.

1060
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,350
It's actually the chocolate...

1061
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:16,550
Chip situation going on in there.

1062
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:18,750
Process is quite something.

1063
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:20,350
Good!

1064
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:23,430
Can you do a snake animal next?

1065
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:26,610
Looks like my peanuts.

1066
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:27,130
No!

1067
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:29,410
It's a pumpkin, not peanuts.

1068
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:39,450
Hold on, he's just a little...

1069
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,570
He's just got a little bit of...

1070
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,640
I just gotta get my fingers in there.

1071
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,620
Who said all pumpkins need to have triangle eyes?

1072
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,300
Some of them have...

1073
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:12,200
Round eyes.

1074
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,180
Pies, what do you think?

1075
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,060
She's stretching like a typical black cat.

1076
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:35,640
Like you know how you see a Halloween decoration of a black cat stretching?

1077
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,020
That's what she looks like right now.

1078
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:41,520
Oops!

1079
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,700
Don't worry about it.

1080
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,120
See, that's a chocolate chip.

1081
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,500
That's why it was so difficult to get it out, you know?

1082
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,310
It looks like a pumpkin still.

1083
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,950
Maybe the stalk is too tall.

1084
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,410
There we go!

1085
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,370
That looks like a pumpkin.

1086
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:08,450
By the way, in this in tears list, from pumpkin to squash, I'm leaning more towards squash.

1087
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,050
What about now?

1088
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,410
More pumpkin than squash.

1089
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,290
More pumpkin than squash, I'd say.

1090
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:23,590
It's not my fault the dough gets all over my hands.

1091
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:28,090
Okay, now what kind of mouth should he have?

1092
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:30,910
What kind of mouth do we want him to have?

1093
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:38,270
We can have him like the one right next to me.

1094
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,990
X mouth.

1095
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:43,110
Smile.

1096
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,840
Get out of the way chocolate chip cookie.

1097
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,800
You guys!

1098
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,660
Oh wait, colon three?

1099
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,580
I can see it, I'm sorry for doubting the process.

1100
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:32,360
It's okay.

1101
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,240
We have to go to Waffle House eventually.

1102
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:36,640
And fight.

1103
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,740
Hold on, there's like a big old chocolate chip right there.

1104
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:44,920
What about that?

1105
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,560
What about like that?

1106
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,520
Does that look good to you guys?

1107
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:52,480
Okay.

1108
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,800
Everybody say goodbye to Mr. Pumpkin!

1109
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,500
He's gone through some troubles along the way.

1110
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,140
He's winking vertically.

1111
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,300
It's his battle scar, okay?

1112
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,900
Alright, everybody say bye to Mr. Pumpkin.

1113
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,660
Okay, we can do one more before I put them in the oven.

1114
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,420
And then the rest I'm gonna make normally.

1115
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,060
The rest, I still have...

1116
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,600
Look guys, look how much dough we have left.

1117
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,860
I'm gonna make normal cookies too.

1118
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,560
Just like a little plop, plop, plop.

1119
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,220
But I don't know what to do with them.

1120
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,880
I'm gonna have cookies for days.

1121
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,560
Mr. Punished Pumpkin.

1122
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:00,100
A spitter?

1123
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,460
That's pretty spooky.

1124
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,420
Okay, we've done...

1125
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,120
Wait, I have to do my 3D witch?

1126
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:20,020
We've done a bat, we've done a skeleton, we've done Freddy Fazbear, we've done...

1127
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,660
A wisp, we've done a pumpkin.

1128
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:31,810
This is hard.

1129
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:34,130
What else is so Halloween, you know?

1130
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,480
But that's so close to the wisps.

1131
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:44,640
No?

1132
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,600
She looked at me when I did that.

1133
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:48,920
Sorry girl.

1134
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,480
You're so silly.

1135
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,020
Why are you looking at me like that?

1136
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:57,940
A ghost.

1137
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,160
We've got that right here.

1138
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:01,160
A goblin.

1139
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,920
How do I even make a goblin?

1140
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,300
How do I make a goblin?

1141
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,720
Okay, we'll do a spider.

1142
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,260
Everybody's saying spider, so...

1143
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,080
We'll do a spider.

1144
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,740
This might be my magnum opus.

1145
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,600
This will be the greatest one.

1146
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:23,880
Okay.

1147
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,160
This is gonna be...

1148
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:29,500
Alright, we're gonna make him kinda big too.

1149
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,320
I might need a second cookie sheet.

1150
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:34,560
Okay.

1151
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,380
Because he's gonna have mandibles and thoraxes and...

1152
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,780
Everything like that, you know?

1153
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,500
Okay, so we're gonna...

1154
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,900
Tear this off and we're gonna make this into the spider body.

1155
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,220
Into the spider-verse.

1156
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:48,760
Okay.

1157
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,060
Alright.

1158
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:55,380
If you can get a little cookie in the oven and not just eat all the dough and feel sick...

1159
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,660
Then you're doing better than me.

1160
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,340
Why do you eat the dough for?

1161
01:10:59,420 --> 01:10:59,800
They sell...

1162
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,660
Actually, when I was at the grocery store...

1163
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,460
I was like...

1164
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,240
I was like, I don't wanna make my...

1165
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,460
I don't wanna have completely pre-made cookie dough.

1166
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:09,960
You know what I mean?

1167
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,700
That's no fun.

1168
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,860
But they sell ones that are like...

1169
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,580
This is cookie dough and you can eat it as a raw cookie dough.

1170
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,960
Which I thought was kinda crazy.

1171
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,700
Might have been safer for me.

1172
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:26,360
Okay.

1173
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,680
Spiders are a little...

1174
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:29,620
Oblong.

1175
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,780
They're a little oval.

1176
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:32,740
Like so.

1177
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,260
Oh wait, hold on.

1178
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,200
Actually, this part is supposed to be the smallest.

1179
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,320
Smaller, smaller, smaller!

1180
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:41,680
Right?

1181
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,800
Isn't this part the smallest and then their butt is huge?

1182
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,160
Right?

1183
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:48,720
It's just the egg.

1184
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,260
Egg is what makes it dangerous.

1185
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,660
Also flour too though, right?

1186
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,820
Yeah, because raw flour...

1187
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,380
Yeah, raw flour is not safe to consume.

1188
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,420
And raw egg is not safe to consume.

1189
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,760
Depending on where you are.

1190
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,260
Some places raw egg is okay.

1191
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,200
But...

1192
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:15,900
I think flour is worse than the egg.

1193
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,560
To be honest.

1194
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,560
What if you just washed the outside of your egg?

1195
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:22,540
Would it then be okay?

1196
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:25,920
Why is this one so fat?

1197
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,980
Look how fat this cookie is.

1198
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,840
Oh no, it makes it worse?

1199
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,340
Wait, why would washing the egg make it worse?

1200
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,520
How does that work?

1201
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:57,330
Okay.

1202
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:59,130
We have the body...

1203
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:00,870
The head and the body...

1204
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,350
Of the spider.

1205
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:06,950
We've got it, we've got it.

1206
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:07,550
Okay.

1207
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,510
I'm gonna give him some eyes.

1208
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,590
The egg is handling things.

1209
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:22,650
Washing then takes the waxy layer off.

1210
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,960
We wash our eggs in the US.

1211
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,680
That's why we refrigerate our eggs.

1212
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,140
It removes the protective membrane.

1213
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,240
Oh...

1214
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,340
So it's the membrane.

1215
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,640
The membrane being gone.

1216
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:51,390
Oh...

1217
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,130
Interesting.

1218
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:59,650
Yeah, and then the bacteria gets in because the membrane is gone.

1219
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:00,810
Interesting.

1220
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,380
You can...

1221
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,240
Just be careful if you eat raw eggs.

1222
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,420
If you're in the US, you know.

1223
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,440
Let's give him a little smile.

1224
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,280
A little smile guy.

1225
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:29,700
Oh, he looks so cute!

1226
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,160
Oh, he looks so precious.

1227
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:35,980
Okay, now time to give him legs so he can move around.

1228
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,000
Creepy crawly.

1229
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,360
Creepy crawly.

1230
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,040
Creepy crawly.

1231
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,220
Who's eating raw eggs?

1232
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,780
Because you would be surprised...

1233
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:48,100
There's a lot of people that eat raw eggs.

1234
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,060
For whatever reason.

1235
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,700
Like in their...

1236
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,140
People that are...

1237
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:58,900
Isn't that like a thing with like guys that are at the gym?

1238
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,100
They eat the raw eggs.

1239
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,060
They're just like, yeah, gotta eat the raw eggs.

1240
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,660
Them gym bros.

1241
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,140
Yeah, the gym bros.

1242
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:20,440
Okay.

1243
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:24,060
Actually, this might use on the rest of the dough, I wonder.

1244
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,080
We got this.

1245
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:38,390
He might have to get his own...

1246
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,830
Thing.

1247
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,390
His own...

1248
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,350
His own cookie platter.

1249
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:44,310
Oh,

1250
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,740
coming apart in my hands.

1251
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:20,090
I have to put two more legs on.

1252
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:20,890
Each side.

1253
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:22,490
I have to put on four more legs.

1254
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:29,870
Bing.

1255
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:34,110
We'll make them smaller.

1256
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:45,430
Okay.

1257
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:46,350
Good.

1258
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:48,750
Good, good, good.

1259
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:53,350
Good, good.

1260
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:06,410
I don't really have room.

1261
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:11,730
Oh gosh, I don't really have room.

1262
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:18,710
He has one...

1263
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,530
The butt leg.

1264
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:23,830
Zoinks, Scoob.

1265
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:24,850
She's dead.

1266
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:25,730
Zoinks.

1267
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:31,410
At the front?

1268
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:32,970
Oh yeah, true, true.

1269
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:36,330
Like off his face, right?

1270
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:42,770
These aren't really legs, but they kind of look like they could be.

1271
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,800
Like so.

1272
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:52,420
Okay.

1273
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,100
It's not really a leg.

1274
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,180
Here, I'll give him a butt leg and then he lost one in the war, okay?

1275
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,760
I kind of want to give him a top hat.

1276
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,200
Okay, I'm going to give him a top hat.

1277
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:04,800
Okay, hold on.

1278
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,600
It's going to be 3D top hat.

1279
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,980
This is some high class...

1280
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,000
Bakery...

1281
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:15,460
Sorcery here, okay?

1282
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,520
This is a skill that you should not try at home, okay?

1283
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:28,380
Only do it in the presence of a trained professional, okay?

1284
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,160
Get

1285
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:41,860
a little smaller.

1286
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:42,640
It's kind of thick.

1287
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,200
What do you want, girly girl?

1288
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,820
What are you looking at me for?

1289
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:46,560
Why did you get up?

1290
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,760
I have to redo it.

1291
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,260
He's gorgeous.

1292
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:56,300
Yeah, Cookie Master's only.

1293
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,840
I think she wants out.

1294
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,360
Oh, she knows it's ready to bake.

1295
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,980
She knows it's time to bake, baby.

1296
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:06,340
Okay.

1297
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,080
7 legs.

1298
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,720
Yeah, because he lost one in the war.

1299
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,140
How many times do I have to tell you?

1300
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,340
He lost it in the war.

1301
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,840
He lost it.

1302
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:22,980
Look at this little top hat.

1303
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,180
Look how precious that is.

1304
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,040
Okay.

1305
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:35,560
Okay.

1306
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,960
Yeah, he's got a phantom limb.

1307
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,620
He's got that phantom pain, baby.

1308
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:43,520
Okay.

1309
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,100
Well, this is going to be...

1310
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,280
It's going to take me a couple of minutes to get them all in the oven.

1311
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,400
Let me see how long they need to bake.

1312
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,260
10 to 12 minutes.

1313
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,380
Until the edges are light golden brown.

1314
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:02,760
So I'm probably...

1315
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,740
Yeah, I'll go periodically check on them.

1316
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,480
But it's going to take me a few minutes to get it in the oven.

1317
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,160
So...

1318
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,360
Oh, wait.

1319
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,180
No, it's fine.

1320
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,780
6 legs plus 1.

1321
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,140
No, it's 7 legs.

1322
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,660
And then he has lost one in the war.

1323
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,140
Okay.

1324
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:29,280
Okay, so give me a few minutes.

1325
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,600
Oh, hold on.

1326
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,580
Everybody say...

1327
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,900
Goodbye to Mr. Spider.

1328
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,240
I have important information regarding Tobey Crier Resident Evil 4.

1329
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,140
No!

1330
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,620
Alright, say goodbye to Mr. Spider.

1331
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,400
He's going back to war!

1332
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,320
Oh my god, this is such a heavy play.

1333
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,480
Okay, he's going to get his own cookie sheet.

1334
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,000
About...

1335
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,060
I don't know how long.

1336
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:07,960
I don't want to rush myself.

1337
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,680
So just give me a few minutes.

1338
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,640
Here, I'm going to put this cookie dough here.

1339
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,380
This is all we got left.

1340
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:20,080
After the spider incident.

1341
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,400
Crazy.

1342
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:30,870
Okay.

1343
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:34,290
Are you guys excited to see how things are going to turn out?

1344
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:40,800
Did you preheat the oven?

1345
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,040
I did, I did, I did.

1346
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,540
So, we're good.

1347
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:44,180
Alright.

1348
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,980
Give me a minute.

1349
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:49,020
Oh my goodness, I need to wash my hands too.

1350
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:50,540
My hands are so greasy.

1351
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:53,920
Give me a minute.

1352
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,020
BRB

1353
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,280
Oh, let me make a little message.

1354
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,260
Let me type up a message.

1355
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:07,920
I'm going to have to clean up my desk after this.

1356
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,080
Oh, I didn't want to type on the keyboard.

1357
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,760
Oh no.

1358
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,580
I didn't want to type on the keyboard.

1359
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,180
Oh well.

1360
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:17,920
Okay, hold on.

1361
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:18,760
Okay.

1362
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:23,140
Ew, my mouth.

1363
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,040
Oh gosh, it feels so gross.

1364
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,520
Okay.

1365
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:49,130
Alright.

1366
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:50,570
BRB!

1367
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:14,420
Alright, let me make a timer for 10 minutes.

1368
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:16,800
Let's make a timer for 10 minutes.

1369
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:18,620
Ew, my mouth is greasy.

1370
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,680
Oh gosh.

1371
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:22,140
Okay, welcome back.

1372
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:22,820
Thank you.

1373
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,140
Alright.

1374
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,500
10 minutes.

1375
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,480
10 minutes.

1376
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,200
Alright.

1377
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:36,980
Copy.

1378
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:50,260
Okay.

1379
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:53,340
Okay.

1380
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:53,640
This one.

1381
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:55,880
Okay.

1382
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:57,660
Start.

1383
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:03,470
It says starting, but don't...

1384
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:06,990
Okay, it's fine.

1385
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:10,590
Oh, can I change it?

1386
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:13,370
Can I lick the spoon?

1387
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:15,470
No, I put it in the sink already.

1388
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:22,070
This is a great spooky stream because you created some truly horrifying creatures and nightmares.

1389
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:23,890
Thank you!

1390
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:26,490
Spooky, spooky.

1391
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:29,670
And then afterwards, you guys... Hold on, let me put my...

1392
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:31,550
Let me... Oh gosh.

1393
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:34,150
I'm gonna put the chocolate here.

1394
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:39,170
I have to put my grease back on.

1395
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:40,830
Hold on.

1396
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:52,830
What was I gonna say?

1397
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:55,350
Oh, we have to ice it after.

1398
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:56,990
Love the BGM.

1399
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:58,150
I know, it's so fun, right?

1400
01:31:58,230 --> 01:31:59,850
It's called...

1401
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:01,870
I downloaded it from Dova Syndrome.

1402
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,390
Halloween no yakusoku, I think.

1403
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:05,150
It was.

1404
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:10,590
Okay.

1405
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,630
And after, we...

1406
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:15,310
Ice it!

1407
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:20,750
After we ice it, we're gonna put some icing on.

1408
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:22,250
Cookie icing.

1409
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:23,910
I only got white.

1410
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:26,470
Can I lick the gloves?

1411
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:29,610
They smell really good.

1412
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:33,430
They're not gloves, they're my hands.

1413
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:35,530
But they smell really good.

1414
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:37,090
My hands smell really good.

1415
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:40,990
What's the icing like, I wonder.

1416
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:42,030
Let's open it up and see.

1417
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,910
I have to open it, open it.

1418
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:48,370
Wait a second.

1419
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:50,350
The seal?

1420
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:54,990
Is this okay?

1421
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:58,650
The seal is like up here.

1422
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:03,670
But this is...

1423
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:05,310
When I unscrewed it...

1424
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:08,990
The seal came off.

1425
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:13,730
Like it's...

1426
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:14,790
It's there.

1427
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:16,590
That's the seal.

1428
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:19,730
It's supposed to be on top of this part.

1429
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:28,620
What if someone licked in there?

1430
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:35,400
Maybe it's just a loose seal.

1431
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:37,640
Isn't that dangerous?

1432
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,240
I licked it.

1433
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:43,300
It was me.

1434
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:46,100
What if someone filmed it on TikTok?

1435
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,560
Oh my gosh, everybody...

1436
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,760
Look up TikTok licking the Halloween icing and tell me if you find anything.

1437
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:59,390
Is it crusty?

1438
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:02,390
No, it smells really good.

1439
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:05,810
It's probably just a loose seal, right?

1440
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:09,790
Loose seal ball.

1441
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:12,270
It's probably fine.

1442
01:34:14,330 --> 01:34:15,570
It's probably fine.

1443
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:17,750
Okay, I have to get the seal out though somehow.

1444
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,540
I don't know how to get it out.

1445
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:32,840
Use the spatula?

1446
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,360
But the spatula has egg on it.

1447
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,120
This is meant for...

1448
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:48,340
This is meant for...

1449
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,300
The finished cookies.

1450
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:02,800
I know toothpaste that unseals when you unscrew the cap.

1451
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:03,380
Oh, maybe.

1452
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:05,920
But then how do I...

1453
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,700
I don't think that's this.

1454
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:19,930
Oh, clean plate?

1455
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:20,930
Yeah, you're so right.

1456
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:28,180
A clean plate!

1457
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:37,600
We did it!

1458
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:48,850
I'm a genius, probably.

1459
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:50,810
Maybe I need to get a fork.

1460
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:52,310
Okay, we'll try it.

1461
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:53,590
We'll get it open.

1462
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:56,810
We'll get it open...

1463
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:00,390
When...

1464
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:02,310
When...

1465
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:04,630
We get the cookies in 5 minutes.

1466
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:07,010
Oh my gosh, are you guys excited to see our cookies?

1467
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:09,050
Are you guys excited?

1468
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:12,470
Still got the spoon handy?

1469
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:14,870
No...

1470
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:16,070
I threw it away.

1471
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:19,390
In the sink, not in the garbage.

1472
01:36:20,630 --> 01:36:22,750
Oh my gosh, I want to see Frebby.

1473
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:24,690
Frebby...

1474
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:28,070
You got oven mitts ready?

1475
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:28,850
Oh yeah!

1476
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:30,890
Oh yeah!

1477
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:34,170
Our cookies are baking now, everybody!

1478
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:41,050
We have 4 minutes and 20 seconds until our cookies are completed.

1479
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:43,690
And...

1480
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:47,890
I guess I won't be able to eat them right away because I need to cool just a little bit.

1481
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:50,590
But...

1482
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:52,390
We will be able to see them.

1483
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:54,770
And how amazing they look.

1484
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:56,130
I'm scared.

1485
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:00,690
Guys, this is like my first time ever shaping cookies and baking them.

1486
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:01,530
Ever, ever, ever.

1487
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:03,590
And I have it all...

1488
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:06,010
All on camera.

1489
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:11,050
BGM sounds like a Halloween version of Suika Ibuki's theme.

1490
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:14,390
I can hear... Wait, how does Suika's theme...

1491
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:15,910
Oh, I hear it, actually.

1492
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:19,090
I hear it.

1493
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:24,750
Whenever I'm like, how does Suika's theme go...

1494
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:30,110
I think of...

1495
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:31,510
Petan.

1496
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:34,370
Your creepies look like creepy pasta.

1497
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:36,570
Oh, I mean creepies of my cookies.

1498
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:45,050
You might want to check the cookies early as the timing can vary.

1499
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:48,790
Can we eat leftover cookie dough?

1500
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:49,110
No!

1501
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:51,050
No, it has...

1502
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:53,290
It has...

1503
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:54,990
Egg!

1504
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,670
It's not good, it's not good.

1505
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:59,510
It's not good, it's not good for you.

1506
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:01,890
And it's got raw flour.

1507
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,950
It's not good for you.

1508
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:05,590
No, no.

1509
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:06,810
Unsafe flour.

1510
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:08,230
Unsafe flour!

1511
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:10,350
We literally just had this whole conversation!

1512
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:14,310
Okay, I'll check them.

1513
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:16,830
Should I go check them now?

1514
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:21,010
Doesn't feel like it's been 10 minutes.

1515
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:24,150
I'm scared.

1516
01:38:25,870 --> 01:38:26,270
Yeah?

1517
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:27,910
Okay, I'm gonna go check them.

1518
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:29,070
I'm gonna go check them.

1519
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:31,290
I'm gonna go check them real quick.

1520
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:34,110
I'll be right back.

1521
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:35,170
I'm scared!

1522
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:37,670
Okay.

1523
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,830
I'll be right back.

1524
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:40,170
Actually, it's been over a little bit.

1525
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:43,110
It's been actually like over 10 minutes because I...

1526
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:45,050
Put them in the oven and I forgot to...

1527
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:46,410
I don't know what time I...

1528
01:38:46,410 --> 01:38:48,670
And I forgot to make a timer.

1529
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:50,570
Okay, I'm gonna go check.

1530
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:09,610
Okay.

1531
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:09,970
So...

1532
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:11,230
Bad news.

1533
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:13,570
I...

1534
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:14,970
Thought they were done.

1535
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:17,110
And I took them out.

1536
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:19,110
And I tried to put them on a plate.

1537
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:21,330
And...

1538
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:22,750
They crumpled.

1539
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:25,810
So they're back in the oven.

1540
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:25,910
They're back in the oven.

1541
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:31,630
But only two of them crumpled.

1542
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:33,790
It was...

1543
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:35,730
The pumpkin and...

1544
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:36,370
Mothman.

1545
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:42,510
That's just the way.

1546
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:44,010
Gotta let them sit.

1547
01:42:44,150 --> 01:42:45,250
Oh, so you think that they're done?

1548
01:42:48,710 --> 01:42:49,850
Is the spider okay?

1549
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:51,310
Yeah, I haven't touched him.

1550
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:53,210
In fact, he looks really great.

1551
01:42:55,810 --> 01:42:57,850
Okay, I wasn't gonna experiment with him.

1552
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:00,710
Cookies need several minutes to firm up once done.

1553
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:01,510
Both.

1554
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:03,070
They cool and harden.

1555
01:43:05,270 --> 01:43:06,390
Let me...

1556
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:08,450
Let me go get them out!

1557
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:11,810
Hold on, let me go...

1558
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:13,790
Let me go get them out.

1559
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:15,350
Oh god, they're gonna burn!

1560
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:35,930
Our cookies are cooling.

1561
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:37,670
Our cookies are cooling.

1562
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:38,790
Cool...

1563
01:44:40,210 --> 01:44:40,770
Cooling...

1564
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:41,270
Down.

1565
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:42,730
Let's do...

1566
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:43,870
Let's do like five...

1567
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:44,050
Oops.

1568
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:45,830
Five minutes of cool.

1569
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:47,410
Then I'll go check on them.

1570
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:51,730
Cooling down.

1571
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:52,950
Cooling down.

1572
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:54,850
Oh, they're cool.

1573
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:55,970
They're cool as a cucumber.

1574
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:56,510
Yeah.

1575
01:44:57,710 --> 01:44:58,450
They need to...

1576
01:44:58,450 --> 01:44:59,250
They need to chill.

1577
01:44:59,350 --> 01:44:59,730
Like, yeah.

1578
01:44:59,850 --> 01:45:00,470
They were up...

1579
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:01,250
They were like crazy.

1580
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:03,670
They were like way up there.

1581
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:04,870
And now they're cooling.

1582
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:05,470
They're coming down.

1583
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:06,250
They're cooling down.

1584
01:45:07,110 --> 01:45:08,030
Oh my gosh.

1585
01:45:08,070 --> 01:45:09,570
Hope Mr. Pumpkin is doing well.

1586
01:45:09,570 --> 01:45:12,530
He only suffered a little minor injury.

1587
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:13,990
Moth...

1588
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:14,870
No, I mean...

1589
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:16,830
The bat, he kind of broke in half.

1590
01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:19,490
But, I think it's okay.

1591
01:45:20,130 --> 01:45:21,010
Maybe I should have...

1592
01:45:21,010 --> 01:45:23,150
I tried to squish him back together a little bit.

1593
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:28,950
They're looking really fantastic.

1594
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:31,750
I'm sure you can guess.

1595
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:35,670
They look really scrumptious.

1596
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:37,370
Scrumptious...

1597
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:38,850
Scrumptious...

1598
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:40,110
Oh yeah.

1599
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:41,430
Glue them back together with icing.

1600
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:41,910
Yeah.

1601
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:45,250
I'm not quite sure...

1602
01:45:45,250 --> 01:45:48,850
How easy it will be to get them off the baking sheet...

1603
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:51,110
To decorate them.

1604
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:56,090
But...

1605
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:03,770
Late to the stream.

1606
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:05,110
What kind of cookies are these?

1607
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:06,670
They're chocolate chip cookies.

1608
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:13,830
But they're spooky Halloween shapes that I made with my own hands.

1609
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:15,910
Very special.

1610
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:17,890
Very, very good.

1611
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:19,730
How about the spider?

1612
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:21,550
He looks amazing, actually.

1613
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:24,510
Spider looks so good.

1614
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:26,730
Hidden raisins?

1615
01:46:26,830 --> 01:46:27,170
No!

1616
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:29,770
Only chocolate.

1617
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:30,530
Only chocolate.

1618
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:32,390
I still have a little bit of dough left.

1619
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:35,710
I might make something else later on off stream.

1620
01:46:35,710 --> 01:46:36,270
Who knows?

1621
01:46:36,910 --> 01:46:38,090
No, I didn't burn them!

1622
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:39,090
They're good, they're good.

1623
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:40,890
Actually, when I opened the door, I was like...

1624
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:43,830
This smells like a wonderland.

1625
01:46:43,950 --> 01:46:44,710
It smells so good.

1626
01:46:46,030 --> 01:46:48,010
I swear, I swear, I swear.

1627
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:50,030
Maybe I should have put them outside.

1628
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:57,510
Maybe I should have put them outside to cool faster.

1629
01:46:59,090 --> 01:47:00,210
It's probably fine.

1630
01:47:04,270 --> 01:47:05,130
Raisin cookies?

1631
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:05,770
Doko?

1632
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:07,230
Not Coco.

1633
01:47:08,270 --> 01:47:09,550
Raisin cookies, out of here.

1634
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:13,930
Actually, I love oatmeal raisin cookies.

1635
01:47:17,410 --> 01:47:17,890
Yeah.

1636
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:20,250
This pie is already snacking on them.

1637
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:22,430
No, she's a good girl.

1638
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:24,550
She's a good girl.

1639
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,000
What's your favorite kind of cookie?

1640
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:32,980
I think mine...

1641
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:42,970
I don't know, it depends on if I really want sweet or not.

1642
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:43,550
Peanut butter?

1643
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:44,890
Peanut butter's...

1644
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:46,030
Your name is literally...

1645
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:47,690
Crunchy PBJ.

1646
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,010
Oatmeal raisin are great cookies.

1647
01:47:52,190 --> 01:47:52,410
Yeah!

1648
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:55,190
I bet the cookies will truly...

1649
01:47:55,190 --> 01:47:57,330
Will look truly three spooky five us.

1650
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:02,070
Are you guys feeling the Halloween spirit?

1651
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:03,810
Are you guys feeling it?

1652
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:05,330
Are you guys like...

1653
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:06,010
Oh my gosh.

1654
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:11,370
It is truly Halloween now that we're making Halloween cookies.

1655
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:12,570
Yeah!

1656
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:14,050
Yeah!

1657
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:15,270
Yeah!

1658
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:18,030
It's Halloween time!

1659
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:19,130
Yeah!

1660
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:23,030
The Halloween spirit.

1661
01:48:25,650 --> 01:48:26,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1662
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:29,350
Kinda spooked, not gonna lie.

1663
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:31,370
I mean...

1664
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:36,370
It's the time where the dimensions...

1665
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:41,350
Are...

1666
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:43,350
For the spirits...

1667
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:46,690
To come.

1668
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:52,750
Is that what they say?

1669
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:58,910
If you didn't take them out, they are still cooking.

1670
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:00,650
No, I took them out, I took them out.

1671
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:03,990
The veil is thinnest.

1672
01:49:04,030 --> 01:49:05,790
Yeah, the veil is thinnest.

1673
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:13,170
For the ghosts to wander into the human realm.

1674
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:16,450
But I'm always...

1675
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:18,050
Basically...

1676
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:19,670
Well, I'm like, you know...

1677
01:49:19,670 --> 01:49:21,650
I'm digital, it's like a weird...

1678
01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:23,090
I'm like a ghost in the machine.

1679
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:28,330
Guys, I'm nervous.

1680
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:29,430
I'm nervous about my cookies.

1681
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:36,830
Oh my gosh.

1682
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:39,710
I was talking with my rigor today.

1683
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:46,050
Welcome to Mambo's help.

1684
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:49,830
Thanks for the two months.

1685
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:50,670
Thanks, gift.

1686
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:53,530
Thanks whoever gifted you for two months.

1687
01:49:54,410 --> 01:49:55,530
Yeah, oh my gosh.

1688
01:49:55,970 --> 01:49:57,750
Right before this I met with...

1689
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:59,660
Yeah, the person doing my rigging and...

1690
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:02,600
We were sorting stuff out.

1691
01:50:07,530 --> 01:50:08,070
So...

1692
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:10,230
Exciting, exciting.

1693
01:50:11,410 --> 01:50:12,750
Stuff is happening.

1694
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:14,650
Sure, I love you.

1695
01:50:14,970 --> 01:50:16,210
Thanks for four months.

1696
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:20,330
Let's go.

1697
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:22,750
Okay, I'm gonna go check on...

1698
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:25,950
Wait, let me update the message.

1699
01:50:30,430 --> 01:50:32,110
Cookies are cool.

1700
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:44,270
Let me go check on them.

1701
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:46,630
Sorry, I know I keep having to step away so much.

1702
01:50:46,710 --> 01:50:47,330
I'm sorry guys.

1703
01:50:53,550 --> 01:50:56,170
Thank you so much for the message.

1704
01:50:57,110 --> 01:50:57,970
Thank you!

1705
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:00,130
Thank you so much!

1706
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:00,810
Oh my gosh.

1707
01:51:00,890 --> 01:51:01,950
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1708
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:06,350
Okay, I'll be right back.

1709
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:55,600
Everybody, I have our cookies!

1710
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:02,000
I have our cookies!

1711
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:02,720
Please!

1712
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:08,240
One moment, please!

1713
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:13,760
One moment, please!

1714
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:16,160
Oh my gosh.

1715
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:18,940
Did they survive after cooling?

1716
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:20,000
We had a bit of an incident.

1717
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:22,820
But most of them survived.

1718
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:26,020
Most of them survived.

1719
01:55:28,340 --> 01:55:30,900
One incident happened which was very sad.

1720
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:33,180
I was very sad.

1721
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,500
But that's okay.

1722
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:36,200
Alright.

1723
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:40,520
I'm gonna start off with our losers.

1724
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:53,620
The initial two that broke in the process of getting them from point A to point B.

1725
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:57,480
Oh wait, no, this was when they were first cooling.

1726
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:59,340
When I didn't let them cool long enough.

1727
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,260
So I would like to welcome...

1728
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,980
Wait, pumpkin on the left.

1729
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:08,520
I don't really need to explain this because you'll be able to tell, I'm sure.

1730
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:10,380
Pumpkin on the left.

1731
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:13,280
Bat on the right.

1732
01:56:20,290 --> 01:56:21,110
You can see...

1733
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:31,250
They had a little bit of an accident.

1734
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:33,830
They're not raw!

1735
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,000
Which is which?

1736
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:40,920
Pumpkin.

1737
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:42,080
Pumpkin.

1738
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:44,780
Bat.

1739
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,260
They're burnt.

1740
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:48,600
No!

1741
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:51,360
Pumpkin.

1742
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:52,800
Bat.

1743
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:00,400
This is...

1744
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:04,320
This is them.

1745
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:08,220
I see Blob and Blorb.

1746
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:09,520
Okay, hold on.

1747
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:15,320
The rest look amazing, I promise you.

1748
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:18,620
Okay, hold on.

1749
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:22,180
Let's go with the next two.

1750
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,340
Have you seen a bat before?

1751
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:29,060
Yes!

1752
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,240
It kind of looked more like a mothman, but you know.

1753
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:35,520
Alright, our next two.

1754
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:41,480
Is Skeleton and Freddy Fazbear.

1755
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:55,220
I

1756
01:57:58,410 --> 01:58:01,830
love this

1757
01:58:08,670 --> 01:58:09,130
skull.

1758
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:11,110
You can kind of see it.

1759
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:14,330
It looks like his eyes are really tight.

1760
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:15,570
Tightly shut.

1761
01:58:20,700 --> 01:58:22,720
Freddy looks really dashing though.

1762
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,140
I'm really proud of that one.

1763
01:58:24,940 --> 01:58:27,760
I'm really proud of that one of Freddy Fazbear.

1764
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,660
It looks so much like him.

1765
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:39,610
I'm just gonna put them on top of each other.

1766
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:41,530
Okay.

1767
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:47,850
Next is, of course, I must show off you guys.

1768
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:49,530
Our little wisp.

1769
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:50,710
Are you ready?

1770
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,680
The wisp somehow...

1771
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:03,680
The eyes moved places and also...

1772
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,340
He grew a nose.

1773
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:14,360
The eyes really moved places a lot.

1774
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:16,980
This one candy is really good, right?

1775
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:18,260
It's actually really good.

1776
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:19,820
Can I eat this one right now?

1777
01:59:21,180 --> 01:59:24,360
If I eat this one, can I eat it right now?

1778
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:28,520
Or should we wait for the icing?

1779
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:33,660
And last, but not least.

1780
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,160
The grand finale.

1781
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:38,880
With the top hat.

1782
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:44,040
As dashing as his smile.

1783
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:48,120
A Facebook Dover.

1784
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:48,820
Thank you.

1785
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:51,000
Spider.

1786
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:53,920
Which he did have some incidents.

1787
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:56,760
He kind of broke into too many pieces.

1788
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:58,920
When I was...

1789
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:01,180
When I was...

1790
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,440
When I was moving him.

1791
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:04,360
Okay.

1792
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:07,880
Introducing...

1793
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:08,520
Spider.

1794
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:30,260
He looks like Flatbug Friday.

1795
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,060
Spider Blob.

1796
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:46,980
Well, guys.

1797
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:48,900
What a treat.

1798
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:52,240
What a treat.

1799
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:58,440
A lot of comments.

1800
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:09,880
And you can even still see his top hat.

1801
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:12,740
Hold on.

1802
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:15,160
His top hat is still there.

1803
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:16,780
Guys, it made it.

1804
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:20,760
Oh, SCMD.

1805
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:21,580
Oh my gosh, it's your birthday.

1806
02:01:21,660 --> 02:01:22,140
Happy birthday.

1807
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:23,500
Sorry, I missed it.

1808
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:24,640
Happy birthday.

1809
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:29,860
The top hat made it.

1810
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:35,140
That's an amazing cookie rendition of the monster from John Connor.

1811
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:36,180
There's the thing.

1812
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,560
He's really precious.

1813
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:42,900
He's really precious.

1814
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:45,720
I'm so happy about him.

1815
02:01:47,220 --> 02:01:50,440
It's like one of those like smiles that only you can see.

1816
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:52,540
Where he like broke off.

1817
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:55,040
Here, but that's okay.

1818
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:56,000
Even he's got...

1819
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,180
It looks like he's got like a fedora.

1820
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:11,080
The spider brought tears to my eyes.

1821
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:12,300
Thanks, vent, of course.

1822
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:14,620
There's...

1823
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:20,190
I don't even know if I want to decorate them.

1824
02:02:20,910 --> 02:02:23,370
I honestly feel like they're perfect as it is.

1825
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:30,590
I'm honestly feeling that they're just really lovely as they are.

1826
02:02:31,770 --> 02:02:34,030
Let me try to... Okay, I don't want to eat him.

1827
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:38,770
Time to eat the wisp.

1828
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:43,950
Itadakimasu!

1829
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,700
Yummy!

1830
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:05,900
I think I am a real baker!

1831
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:18,780
Yummy!

1832
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:23,400
Yummy!

1833
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:25,300
Yummy!

1834
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:25,500
One more.

1835
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:27,820
One more bite.

1836
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:38,810
A success!

1837
02:03:45,010 --> 02:03:45,930
Yes.

1838
02:03:47,130 --> 02:03:47,930
What's that taste?

1839
02:03:50,470 --> 02:03:52,050
It's like salty.

1840
02:03:53,190 --> 02:03:55,270
Have you guys been crying too much?

1841
02:03:55,870 --> 02:03:57,630
You're making your little body salty.

1842
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:01,110
Why is everything black?

1843
02:04:01,470 --> 02:04:03,110
Your eyes are right there.

1844
02:04:03,810 --> 02:04:05,930
If anything, I just kind of...

1845
02:04:05,930 --> 02:04:10,650
I gave you like a sculpting, you know?

1846
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:13,990
I gave you a real chiseled...

1847
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:15,270
What's the word?

1848
02:04:15,830 --> 02:04:16,970
Cheekbone right there.

1849
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:19,330
Oh no, she ate us.

1850
02:04:25,470 --> 02:04:27,570
Did you swap the sugar for salt?

1851
02:04:27,570 --> 02:04:29,550
No, I think it's your tears.

1852
02:04:31,650 --> 02:04:33,310
First Mint Phantom to eat tomorrow.

1853
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:39,310
She ate us!

1854
02:04:41,590 --> 02:04:43,350
Yay, success everybody!

1855
02:04:43,650 --> 02:04:44,230
Success!

1856
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:48,350
Yay!

1857
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:49,830
Oh my gosh.

1858
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:51,290
Which is your favorite cookie?

1859
02:04:51,830 --> 02:04:53,190
I think mine is the spider.

1860
02:04:53,810 --> 02:04:56,470
But I'm also really a big fan of Freddy Fazbear.

1861
02:04:56,470 --> 02:04:58,190
You know what Freddy looks like?

1862
02:04:59,090 --> 02:05:00,470
He kind of looks like that...

1863
02:05:02,450 --> 02:05:05,250
What was that scary story to tell in the dark?

1864
02:05:06,050 --> 02:05:08,870
That lady that has the long hair.

1865
02:05:09,550 --> 02:05:10,490
The Wisp is your favorite?

1866
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:13,410
Fredby and Spider.

1867
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:18,890
The lady in white kind of looks like her.

1868
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:21,630
Kind of looks like her.

1869
02:05:27,810 --> 02:05:28,450
Yeah.

1870
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:33,010
Oh, I meant losing consciousness because you ate us.

1871
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:35,850
I gotcha.

1872
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:38,590
Spider is a real treat though.

1873
02:05:40,510 --> 02:05:41,490
Oh my goodness.

1874
02:05:42,110 --> 02:05:45,110
I'm so happy they turned out really well.

1875
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:46,210
Yay!

1876
02:05:46,870 --> 02:05:49,630
Well guys, I think today's stream is a bit of a shorter stream.

1877
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:54,930
But I feel really happy about the cookies we baked.

1878
02:05:54,930 --> 02:06:00,530
So, thanks for joining me on my first ever baking adventure.

1879
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:02,330
Thank you.

1880
02:06:03,010 --> 02:06:03,770
Thank you.

1881
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:06,030
Thank you.

1882
02:06:06,650 --> 02:06:07,510
Thank you.

1883
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:09,130
Thank you.

1884
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:13,530
Thank you.

1885
02:06:13,910 --> 02:06:17,730
I gotta wash my hands like real good now and I gotta clean up everything.

1886
02:06:17,930 --> 02:06:19,390
And I still have this dough here.

1887
02:06:20,190 --> 02:06:22,230
That I gotta do something with.

1888
02:06:26,210 --> 02:06:27,430
Thank you guys!

1889
02:06:29,630 --> 02:06:31,230
This girl I like was extra cute today.

1890
02:06:31,310 --> 02:06:32,810
How do I handle this?

1891
02:06:39,530 --> 02:06:40,050
Ducky!

1892
02:06:40,650 --> 02:06:41,470
Thanks for the 5 Gupta!

1893
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:47,370
Were we cheating on Minto?

1894
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:54,330
I'm just a ghost man.

1895
02:06:54,570 --> 02:06:55,410
Thanks for the fun stream.

1896
02:06:55,530 --> 02:06:56,750
I hope you guys had fun.

1897
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:59,650
I hope you guys... This is your reminder.

1898
02:07:01,210 --> 02:07:03,410
Trust the process.

1899
02:07:04,570 --> 02:07:06,390
Thanks for the 5 Gupta!

1900
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:10,230
Trust... Oh, show pause?

1901
02:07:10,610 --> 02:07:11,970
Oh, she's not in here.

1902
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:15,950
My hands are greasy.

1903
02:07:16,990 --> 02:07:19,010
I don't wanna pick her up with greasy hands.

1904
02:07:21,310 --> 02:07:21,930
Hold on.

1905
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:23,770
Let me see if I can go find her.

1906
02:07:24,330 --> 02:07:25,770
Let me see if I can go find her.

1907
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:26,490
Hold on.

1908
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:27,790
One second.

1909
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:30,730
One second.

1910
02:07:31,050 --> 02:07:31,810
I'll go find her.

1911
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:42,920
She's so cute.

1912
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:44,560
You're so so cute.

1913
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:48,460
Hold on.

1914
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:49,800
Let me find where she is.

1915
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:06,640
Everybody wants to see you.

1916
02:10:14,810 --> 02:10:16,510
Thanks for the 5 Gupta!

1917
02:10:17,150 --> 02:10:19,270
Thank you for the 5 Gupta!

1918
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:22,990
Have a good night!

1919
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:23,630
Thank you!

1920
02:10:24,330 --> 02:10:24,810
Oh, wait.

1921
02:10:24,910 --> 02:10:26,170
Let me make sure...

1922
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:29,550
I forgot to check something.

1923
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:32,370
Yeah, okay.

1924
02:10:32,970 --> 02:10:33,650
Bye bye!
