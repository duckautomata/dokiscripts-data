1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:13,560
Oh, wait, I set it up so fast that I forgot to do a loading screen.

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,160
Wait, am I live?

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,160
Maybe I am.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,360
Am I live?

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,680
Oh, I am.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:28,920
Oh!

7
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,550
I was like, setting everything up so fast, I was like...

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,210
That I forgot to do a loading screen.

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,910
My bad.

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:40,430
Sorry.

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,370
Hello, welcome.

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,390
Oh, let me tweet too.

13
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,710
It's gonna be not such a long stream.

14
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,810
I don't know if you can hear it.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,930
The Omnicord.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,880
I'm gonna have to adjust my mic.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,200
I should probably do a double mic setup for this, now that I think about it.

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,920
Never saw an Omnicord before.

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,060
Cool, I'm glad that I can be maybe your first experience with it then.

20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,600
It is very neat looking, right?

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,480
It's actually from the 80s, so it's quite a trooper for living.

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,900
Hold on, let me actually try and do a double mic setup.

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,960
Let me try that real quick, I've never tried it before.

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,120
I have my other mic out.

25
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,760
I should have been more prepared.

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,880
I lied, I don't have my mic out.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,460
Why did I say that?

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,080
Why did I say that?

29
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,260
I have my other mic out.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,220
I don't, I put it away.

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,220
I literally cleaned up earlier.

32
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,640
What should we play, guys?

33
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,540
We can play anything that we want.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,460
Here, I'll even... I'll do some silly stuff too.

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,460
I'm getting it together.

36
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,640
Laughs in before the 80s, what do you mean by that?

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,900
I'm going to plug this in.

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,660
Tell me if you hear me in my other mic.

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,780
Actually, hold on, I'm going to turn off my mic so it doesn't pop.

40
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,630
Whoa, oh my gosh, so crisp.

41
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,990
Hello, wow.

42
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,750
This is my other mic, let me move some stuff around.

43
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,930
I will set up... it's very loud.

44
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,450
I think so, it's not really set up very much.

45
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,890
I use this mic for recording vocals for songs.

46
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,110
It almost has become like an ASMR.

47
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,030
But it's not ASMR, we're doing Omnicore.

48
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,490
Give me a second, I didn't prepare for... I just had this idea on a whim.

49
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,150
So I was like, I'll just set it up really fast.

50
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,610
That's exactly, you were getting the behind the scenes of the setup.

51
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,430
And everything.

52
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,890
I'm going to put this mic...

53
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,770
And then, hold on, now if I talk like this, it's like I'm talking into both.

54
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,270
I don't know if you can tell, actually.

55
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,130
Okay, let me grab my Omnicore.

56
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,150
And, okay.

57
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,910
Sounds amazing, maybe I should switch to this mic then.

58
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,050
For like normal streams.

59
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,950
No, it's too...

60
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,550
It's too...

61
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,290
They're in sync, yeah, they're in sync.

62
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,130
I feel like it's too crisp, maybe.

63
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,650
Alright, I'm going to put this mic, right?

64
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,650
Sorry, sorry.

65
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,930
Oh wait, if I point it down, the mic is going to fall out.

66
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,690
Hold on, I'm trying to figure this out.

67
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,450
One moment, please.

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,470
Can you explain what an Omnicore is?

69
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,810
Yeah, I can try.

70
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,870
I can do my bestie.

71
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:34,910
Because...

72
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,250
Sorry if you can hear that, I'm like sliding it into the mic holder.

73
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,070
It's this little contraption that you see down here.

74
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,250
I don't even know how much to describe it though, because...

75
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,970
Basically, it's like, you see all these buttons?

76
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,790
They're cords.

77
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,830
So, here, I'll play some for you.

78
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,890
Sorry, sorry, the mic slipped out of the...

79
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,310
Okay, this mic holder is not working.

80
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,110
Sorry if you heard that, I'm sorry.

81
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,690
You hear that?

82
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,330
You hear that?

83
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,990
So, it just plays kind of like, you can change.

84
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,960
And then, the slider that you see on the, I guess, your left...

85
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,900
When I slide it like that, just with my finger, it works.

86
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,950
Just like that.

87
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,850
It's very like, light taps and stuff.

88
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,530
Like that, like that.

89
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,670
And it plays it.

90
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,970
Just like, it's so...

91
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,310
It's so cute.

92
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,430
I know, right?

93
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,730
It's very, very cute.

94
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,490
I'm still trying to figure out a way, because currently I'm holding...

95
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,970
I'm currently holding the second mic, and so...

96
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,970
I need to figure out a way to...

97
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,410
To be able, because I need to be able to use both hands to switch between chords.

98
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,790
Maybe if I put it, like, in my lap.

99
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,750
Let's see.

100
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,970
Like so.

101
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,830
On top of the speaker.

102
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,230
I think that works.

103
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,870
I think that works.

104
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:49,070
So some of you guys might be familiar with this instrument already, and you don't even realize, because it was common in Adventure Time.

105
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,070
Hold on, I'm making sure, if I move my thigh, it doesn't...

106
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,290
Sounds a bit like Steven Universe.

107
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,990
Same musician?

108
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,230
Wait, why did I just type Adventure Time?

109
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,710
Hold on, I'm not gonna have you guys listen to that.

110
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,530
Let's see.

111
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,710
And if you ever get one...

112
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,970
You can always, if you're just like, oh, I wanna play this, but I don't, you know...

113
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,110
You can follow guitar chords, and it kind of works the same way, which is pretty neat.

114
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,830
So I'm gonna warm up, I suppose.

115
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,710
Hold on, I'm gonna...

116
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,950
Attempt this.

117
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,070
I wish I could find a good way to hold it.

118
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,170
Sorry if it keeps going in and out.

119
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,170
I'm so sorry, guys.

120
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,910
I should've set this up better.

121
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,750
Let me try just like this.

122
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,510
It's resting on my booby mouse pad.

123
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Can you hear that okay?

124
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,300
That's good.

125
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,880
Turn it up a little.

126
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,180
I won't be singing super duper loud, I think, so...

127
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,420
I have to warm up, sorry.

128
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:20,560
But I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're gonna lose me, too This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me crazy And I need to save you, but who's going to save me?

129
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:57,960
Please forgive me for whatever I do When I don't remember you Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away I can't remember what it made me say But I remember that when I saw you frown I swear it wasn't me, it was the crown

130
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:14,540
This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me crazy And I need to save you, but who's going to save me?

131
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:41,980
Please forgive me for whatever I do When I don't remember you Please forgive me for whatever I do When I don't remember you That's like a warm-up song, sorry Here, I'll do something silly now

132
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,580
I'll do something silly now for you guys Play All-Star, that's a good one, too

133
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,300
Oh, sorry, sorry, okay, let's do this one, too I've never done this one before, so...

134
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,800
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,540
Why is it all A minor, my, like you should wear a warning?

136
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,320
It's dangerous, I'm falling

137
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:41,220
There's no escape, I can't wait I need a hit, baby, give me it You're dangerous, I'm loving it

138
00:11:45,520 --> 00:12:01,260
Too high, can't come down This doesn't feel right Loose in my head, spinning round and round Do you feel me now?

139
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,920
Why is it all A minor?

140
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:16,880
This is so strange With a taste of your lips, I wanna ride Where is that?

141
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,820
No You're toxic?

142
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:35,360
That doesn't sound right Under the taste of a poison paradise I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

143
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:48,080
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

144
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,050
Yay, that was interesting.

145
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,650
Let's see.

146
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,370
Okay, I can try All Star too.

147
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:42,570
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed But she was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running Didn't make sense not to live for...

148
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,410
Oh gosh, that scared me.

149
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,210
Oh my gosh, thank you.

150
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,490
Remember you?

151
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,390
I can do that one.

152
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,230
I'll do it after this.

153
00:13:52,070 --> 00:14:11,370
Hit the ground running Didn't make sense not to live for fun Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb So much to do, so much to see So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

154
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:25,010
You'll never know if you don't go You'll never shine if you don't glow Hey now, you're an all star What the hell does that mean?

155
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:25,870
Sorry.

156
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:41,450
Get your game on, go play Hey now, you're a rock star Get the show on, get paid All that glitters is... I don't know this note.

157
00:14:46,110 --> 00:15:04,540
Only shooting stars break the mold It was like C-sharp-D-I-M I don't know what that means.

158
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,320
C-sharp-D-I-M What does that mean?

159
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,920
What kind of Omnicord do you have?

160
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,800
The same one that's on the screen, baby.

161
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,400
I don't exactly remember what model it is.

162
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:16,820
I'm sorry.

163
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,360
OM84

164
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,220
C -sharp but the fifth one is semitone lower.

165
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh, diminished.

166
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Cool.

167
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,840
I don't have C-sharp on here.

168
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,420
I just went to C-minor.

169
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,020
It's fine.

170
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,400
Whatever.

171
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,620
Let's see.

172
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
This is a sad song though.

173
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,600
Are you sure?

174
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,380
Wait, remember you.

175
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,280
That's what I did earlier.

176
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,360
Oh, I think it came late.

177
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,800
I'm sorry.

178
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,860
I think it was later.

179
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,060
I was thinking of the other one.

180
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,540
What's the other Adventure Time song?

181
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,240
Adventure Time guitar chords.

182
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,300
Yeah, the notes are backed up.

183
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:18,900
Sorry.

184
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,500
Oh, Everything Stays.

185
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,840
Is it okay if I play that one?

186
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,440
Will you guys be too sad?

187
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,180
lol

188
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,180
Whoa, that's not at all.

189
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,500
Sorry.

190
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,500
That was terrible.

191
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:42,980
lol

192
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:46,260
lol So slight, slightly, daily and nightly, in little ways, when everything stays.

193
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,440
Sorry, I feel like my hand is blocked because I have my hand over the slider.

194
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,460
It's kind of covering the speaker.

195
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,680
So I'm sorry if it's making it muffled a little bit.

196
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,070
Let's see, what else can we play?

197
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:34,970
What's another...

198
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,770
Live concert where you play the Omnicord?

199
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,170
The people need... wait, Chara!

200
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,550
I mean, maybe... Astro Girl, are you guys okay?

201
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,710
Do you just want to let it all out?

202
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,550
I don't even know, hold on.

203
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,700
No, it's okay.

204
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,020
It's okay to not be okay.

205
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,940
Life is tough.

206
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,700
Even afterlife can be tough sometimes.

207
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:41,990
But you know, just take it one day at a time.

208
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,350
It'll be okay, you know?

209
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,720
I don't think this is the right chord.

210
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,220
Starlight, you shine.

211
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,620
Illuminate the sky.

212
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,720
The endless...

213
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,240
Hold

214
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,520
on, let me try a different... Maybe I can find a different chord.

215
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,370
Oh, maybe this.

216
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,030
I think this probably goes with like a...

217
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,300
I can't get it right though.

218
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,640
Sorry, I'm not so musically inclined to be able to... Oh wait, maybe this starts from the beginning.

219
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,060
Oh no, it doesn't.

220
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,840
I really like this instrument though.

221
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,420
It's really pretty.

222
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:00,500
Okay.

223
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,700
Nope, that's not right.

224
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,360
These chords are so bad.

225
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,680
Oh, nope, sorry.

226
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:42,880
A little dream...

227
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,820
Sorry, there's a lot.

228
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,260
Sounds better.

229
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,160
Wait, no, I don't think that sounds good.

230
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,340
I keep saying A flat, or sorry, E flat, but I don't think it works.

231
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,580
Oh, yeah.

232
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,720
Ah, ah?

233
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,070
I don't have this chord.

234
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:46,530
Oh no.

235
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,530
Sorry.

236
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:51,610
Sorry.

237
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,750
I don't have it though.

238
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,330
I did say it was a practice room, okay?

239
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:53,470
I don't have it.

240
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:32,270
Ureshii koto kanashii koto mo zenbu

241
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,910
Yay.

242
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,590
Sorry, that was so scuffed.

243
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,730
Miyu, thank you for the okajoubaru.

244
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,490
Thank you.

245
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,410
Thank you, thank you.

246
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,350
What else?

247
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,190
Oh, hold on.

248
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,150
Popular English songs.

249
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,270
Let's see.

250
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,410
What's another song?

251
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:07,690
That was great.

252
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,570
Thank you.

253
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,790
What's vanilla twilight?

254
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,490
What's that one?

255
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:16,530
Popular.

256
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,330
Ghostbusters.

257
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,730
That's a good one.

258
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,030
Wait, is it bad?

259
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,070
I don't know Ghostbusters' originals so much.

260
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,730
I only know Bustin'.

261
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,270
Let's see.

262
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,890
This is gonna sound terrible.

263
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:45,030
If there's something strange... Wait, it's not giving me any... Wait, why is it B?

264
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,750
If there's something strange... I don't think this works.

265
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,270
I don't think this works, you guys.

266
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:04,770
If there's something strange in your neighborhood, who are you gonna call?

267
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,550
Ghostbusters!

268
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,590
If there's something weird and it don't look good, who are you gonna call?

269
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,390
Ghostbusters!

270
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,090
Oh wait!

271
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,250
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

272
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,010
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

273
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:47,810
If you're seeing things and you're running through your head, who are you gonna call?

274
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,890
Ghostbusters!

275
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,710
An invisible man sleeping in your bed.

276
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,810
Who are you gonna call?

277
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,770
Ghostbusters!

278
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,480
Coco.

279
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,720
Oh my goodness.

280
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,370
I could try.

281
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,070
You guys are really wanting to cry tonight.

282
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,970
Thank you.

283
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,590
Remember me.

284
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,730
No, I have to say goodbye.

285
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,850
Remember me.

286
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,950
Don't... Sorry.

287
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,730
Don't let it make you cry.

288
00:27:53,730 --> 00:28:04,730
For even if I'm far away, I hold you in my heart.

289
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,570
Sorry, I'm so bad at this.

290
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:19,970
I sing a secret song to you each night.

291
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,250
We are apart.

292
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,890
Remember me.

293
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,910
No, I have to travel far.

294
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,830
Remember me.

295
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:48,210
Each time you hear a sad guitar, know that I'm with you the only way that I can be.

296
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,670
Until you're in my arms again.

297
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,730
Remember

298
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,760
me.

299
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,440
Yay!

300
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,740
Yay!

301
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,160
Jeanette Juice by Snoop Dogg.

302
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,880
I don't know that.

303
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,320
I'm sorry.

304
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,180
Let's see.

305
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,960
Fight on the outside.

306
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,840
I'm trying to think of another pop song.

307
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,020
What's another pop song?

308
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,940
Clappy.

309
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,900
Thank you.

310
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,360
Indie Haven.

311
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,420
Everybody kind of has their own reasoning for things, you know?

312
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,720
Lips of an angel.

313
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,780
Our House by The Carpenters.

314
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,880
Sing?

315
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,220
Oh, wait.

316
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,440
What major?

317
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,140
Wait, what?

318
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,560
Hold on, maybe this one.

319
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,100
I think I hear it, actually.

320
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,860
No, I think I hear the other one better.

321
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,820
Wait, maybe I don't.

322
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,380
Sing a song.

323
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,400
Sing out loud.

324
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,540
Sing out.

325
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,520
Strong.

326
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,560
Sing of good things.

327
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,460
Not bad.

328
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,300
Sing of happy.

329
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,700
Not sad.

330
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,160
Sing.

331
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,480
Sing a song.

332
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,260
Make it simple.

333
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,540
To last your whole life.

334
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,360
Long.

335
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,620
Don't worry that it's not good enough.

336
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:47,740
For anyone else to hear.

337
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,040
Just sing.

338
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,540
Sing a song.

339
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,140
La.

340
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,360
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

341
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,060
La.

342
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,790
La, la, la, la.

343
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,550
Wait, someone said Frank Sinatra.

344
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,310
Makes me want to throw my bandana into the ocean.

345
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,490
Figuring it out as we go.

346
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,510
Yep, pretty much.

347
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,270
Fly me to the moon.

348
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,750
And let me play among the stars.

349
00:32:52,750 --> 00:33:02,750
Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars.

350
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:12,750
In other words, hold my hand.

351
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:26,530
In other words, baby, kiss me.

352
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,130
Fill my heart with song.

353
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:38,630
And let me sing forevermore.

354
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,690
You are all I long for.

355
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:49,270
All I worship and adore.

356
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:59,790
In other words, please be true.

357
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:10,410
In other words, I love you.

358
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,480
Wait, I tried to hit the high note.

359
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,220
I couldn't hit it.

360
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,760
I'm sorry.

361
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,720
We're around this.

362
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,660
It's as high as it goes.

363
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,130
Break stuff.

364
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,370
Oh my gosh, let's try it.

365
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,190
Break stuff guitar chords.

366
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,460
It's just one of those days when you don't want to wake up.

367
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,000
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks.

368
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,920
You don't really know why, but you want to justify.

369
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,960
Ripping someone's head off.

370
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,920
No human contact.

371
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,920
And if you interact, your life is on contract.

372
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,860
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker.

373
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,140
It's just one of those days.

374
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,440
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

375
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,160
I think you better quit letting shit slip.

376
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip.

377
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,360
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit.

378
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,600
I think you better quit talking that shit.

379
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,240
Punk, so come and get it.

380
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,560
Wait.

381
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,860
Get it.

382
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,220
How are you pressing the right chords?

383
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,800
I don't know.

384
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,560
I don't know.

385
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,280
Stronger than you.

386
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,380
I don't know that one.

387
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:02,680
Wait.

388
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,180
Stronger than you.

389
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:04,960
Steven.

390
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,100
Sorry.

391
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,260
Universe.

392
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,040
I could do the opening though.

393
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,140
I'll try and learn it for next time.

394
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
But I can do...

395
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,100
Let's see.

396
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,200
Pinto-chan, kawaii.

397
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,280
Arigatou.

398
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,020
Where's the chorus?

399
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,680
Of what?

400
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,600
Break stuff?

401
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,700
That is the chorus.

402
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,520
It's all about the he says, she says...

403
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,860
That's it.

404
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,940
Beyond the sea.

405
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,980
I'll do that one after this.

406
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:44,740
Hold on.

407
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,280
Beyond the sea.

408
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,820
I'll do that song.

409
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,480
I don't have that much time.

410
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,300
So I'll do that one last.

411
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,880
And I'll do this one.

412
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,020
And then beyond the sea.

413
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:09,840
What?

414
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,040
Why does it sound so weird?

415
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,320
Why do I...

416
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,360
Why do I feel like I'm not getting it right?

417
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,440
Sorry, it doesn't sound very great.

418
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,620
Maybe it's not...

419
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,540
Hold on, let me try this one instead.

420
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,160
Nope, it's giving me the same one.

421
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,460
Maybe I think it's right.

422
00:38:30,340 --> 00:39:24,760
It's true, cause I think you're so good And I'm nothing like you Look at you go I just adore you I wish that I knew What makes you think I'm so special If I could begin to do Something that does right by you I would do about anything I would even learn how to love When I see the way you look Shaken by how long it took.

423
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,580
I could do about anything.

424
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,560
I could even learn how to love like you.

425
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,580
Love like you.

426
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,760
Love me like you.

427
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,900
Sorry, I can't get it right at all.

428
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,080
Sounds like the keys don't match.

429
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,680
I know, it didn't sound right to me.

430
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,360
I was just doing what they...

431
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,600
Maybe I'm remembering it wrong.

432
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,420
Oh well, I tried.

433
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,240
I could do it in karaoke.

434
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,920
Somewhere...

435
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,560
Beyond the sea...

436
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,780
Sea...

437
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,480
Somewhere...

438
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,700
Oh my gosh, there's so many...

439
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,720
Somewhere...

440
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,240
Waiting for me...

441
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:48,180
My lover stands on golden sands...

442
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:57,320
And watches the ships that go sailing.

443
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,780
Wow, thank you so much for the 50 gifts.

444
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,560
Guys, I don't know about this one.

445
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,080
There's so many chords, I can't tell where to change at for me.

446
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,320
I'll make it be comfortable.

447
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,540
Beyond the sea...

448
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,040
Sea...

449
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,080
Somewhere...

450
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,540
Beyond the sea...

451
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,360
Somewhere...

452
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,540
Waiting for me...

453
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,800
My lover...

454
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:49,180
Stands on golden sands...

455
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,040
Sanders, not sands.

456
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,840
And watches the ships...

457
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:05,900
That go sailing...

458
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,700
I can't get it.

459
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,080
Somewhere...

460
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,880
Beyond the sea...

461
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,060
She's there...

462
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,920
Watching for me...

463
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,900
If I could fly...

464
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,240
Like birds on...

465
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,860
High...

466
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,840
And straight to her arms...

467
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,920
I'd go, I'd go...

468
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,160
Sail...

469
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,780
Yeah, this is my first stream.

470
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,300
I'm pretty down, eating half gallon of cookie dough ice cream to cure the pain and your singing helps too.

471
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,060
Ah, that sounds really good.

472
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,960
Actually, earlier I really was like, I want a Snickers ice cream bar.

473
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,680
So I think cookie dough ice cream is the right way to go.

474
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,730
Oh, you changed your name back!

475
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,650
I had to put down Pugmug.

476
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:41,730
No!

477
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,670
Wait, you were Pugmug this whole time?

478
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,450
Teacup!

479
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,030
Oh my god!

480
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,090
Well, welcome back, sadly.

481
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,230
I'm happy that you're back.

482
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,790
I did kind of wonder.

483
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,050
Melodies of life!

484
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,050
OK, that's a good one.

485
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,490
Maybe because I messed up this one.

486
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:14,130
Maybe I can do...redeem, redeem with melodies of life!

487
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,570
And then this is the last one for real.

488
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,920
Alone, far up...

489
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,180
Oh no.

490
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,280
Wait, I don't have C sharp.

491
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,220
What's equivalent to C sharp?

492
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,600
D flat?

493
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,160
Thank you.

494
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:59,550
Alone for a while, I've been searching through the...

495
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,230
Wait, what's equivalent to G sharp?

496
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,770
Oh, Jelly, thank you for the raid!

497
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,430
A flat.

498
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:20,570
Alone for a while...

499
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,250
I can't wait.

500
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,550
Am I getting it wrong?

501
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:39,730
Searching through the dawn for traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart

502
00:45:51,690 --> 00:46:04,370
To...weave...wait...weave...by...picking up the pieces that remain...melodies...of...a...life...

503
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,490
Love's lost a refrain...

504
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:13,570
I can't.

505
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,170
I give up.

506
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,370
I give up.

507
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:18,870
I give up.

508
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,270
You know what?

509
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,290
There was no redeeming.

510
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,230
There was no redeeming.

511
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:23,830
I'm so sorry.

512
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,150
I'm so sorry.

513
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,330
Anyway, thank you guys.

514
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:31,150
Um, hopefully, hopefully you feel a little bit more relaxed.

515
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:37,370
If not, um, if not, uh, here, let me, since I sound so close, let me get close.

516
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,510
Uh, wait.

517
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,890
Now I'm gonna even get, I'm gonna get rid of the disc.

518
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:47,370
Everything.

519
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:48,350
Goodbye, Omnicore.

520
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:48,810
Everything.

521
00:46:51,390 --> 00:47:01,910
Hopefully, hopefully, um, this helped you, um, calm down a little bit, or if you needed it or anything like that, or made you giggle a little bit, maybe.

522
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:04,170
Sorry.

523
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:05,750
Okay, good.

524
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:06,830
I did write practice.

525
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,010
I did write Omnicore practice karaoke, so...

526
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:21,210
So, hopefully you didn't expect too much, but, um, or maybe you learned about the Omnicore, and if so, that makes me really happy because this is my beloved instrument.

527
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:21,890
I love this.

528
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,020
I love my Omnicore very much, so...

529
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:32,510
And, um, yeah, uh, uh, make sure you drink water, okay?

530
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:38,290
And, um, um, um, things will be okay.

531
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:40,590
Yeah.

532
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,590
Things will be okay.

533
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

534
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,450
So, uh, have a good night.

535
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:53,750
Take it easy.

536
