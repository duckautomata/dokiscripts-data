11
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,270
Because I was watching Doki finish Metal Gear Solid Delta.

12
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,550
So I didn't get to sleep until like almost 5 a.m.

14
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,970

What if my maid cafe...

24
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,570
It's already pretty abandoned.

25
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,850
It's, like, pretty rickety.

26
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,570

Everybody on the East Coast, please stay warm, for real.

30
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,110
Your maid cafe needs power.

31
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,270
Where do you think I stream from?

32
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,990
I know it's a little late, but I wanted to say the your song
with A1 is absolutely fantastic.

33
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,770
Can't believe my Oshi teamed with my favorite Toll Music
Circle.

34
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,990

Thank you.

40
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,650
Everybody, good luck.

41
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:31,090
I woke up this morning and I was like, first of all, I was
like I very rarely wake up and don't know where I am.

42
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,930
not me either after staying up to 5 a.m.

43
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:50,610
to see the end of doki mgs no i i woke up and i was like did
i float out of my maid cafe again where am i it was that bad

44
00:08:50,610 --> 00:09:02,990
it was really bad and then i thought it was saturday for me
and i was like oh no what was i thinking why would i put

45
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:17,990
alan wake right before the densetsu collab today i'm such an
idiot why didn't i do why did i do that and so i checked my

46
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:30,490
phone which has my calendar on it and and it said for
saturday it said leave it alone the game that's on my

47
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,770
schedule And I was like, oh, no, that's what I must have
meant to put.

48
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,830
And I put

49
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,600
Amai's calendar.

50
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,500
It literally said, clearly it's Saturday in my brain.

51
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,320
I was so convinced that it's Saturday.

52
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,640
And I was like, I didn't play Alan Wake yesterday.

53
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,480
So I'm playing Alan Wake today.

54
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,990
And so I made a tweet.

55
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,910
I was like, guys, I'm so sorry.

56
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,530
I was so silly putting Alan Wake because I was like, you
know, obviously i scheduled it the way that i did because i

57
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:17,990
knew that how fast i've been playing i would not be able to
finish the chapter before the densetsu collab so i scheduled

58
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:27,370
for friday for my time instead of saturday which i usually
do and so i was like oh my gosh why did i do that i knew it

59
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:39,670
was gonna take too long and so i tweeted i tweeted i was
like i'm sorry guys i can't play alan wake of the 10 sets to

60
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:49,450
collab and you know what kind of bothers me there were too
many replies of people being like we understand me and

61
00:10:52,540 --> 00:11:03,140
it wasn't until after i was like waking up a little bit more
you guys are too nice instead of being like uh dubby it's

62
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:16,210
friday not saturday you guys should have been like um idiot
what are you talking about it's friday not saturday stupid

63
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:26,130
and so i was like oh my gosh it's it's friday i woke up a
little bit more i was like wait a second it's friday and

64
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:33,610
then i got really confused because i was like what did i
schedule for saturday for what it's worth the confusion

65
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:45,230
caused from your tweet kind of shocked me awake and it's a
some things I was I was like oh my gosh am I okay I was I

it's diner's fault so true so true I just have so much on my
plate right now so many things that I'm thinking about

73
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:56,910
honestly if I didn't have Steiner and everybody else that
said to me I don't know what I would do

74
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:15,590
but we can still blame him we can still blame my manager
yeah but uh Wednesday night we did have like we have a

75
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:31,850
weekly den sets a meeting on wednesdays and uh we had some
really good news so oh my gosh i'm so hyped yeah yeah yeah

super bowl ad close

79
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:22,060
close no i'm just kidding if only just like mint i do that
too or else i forget yeah I have so many things on my to-do

80
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:28,940
list and like I'll I'll cross the older things that I need
to do are not getting crossed off because unfortunately

81
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:40,200
newer more and like more uh pro what's the word like not
important but like more uh time they they have a faster

82
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:54,460
deadline pressing yes yes more pressing things keep coming
up instead yeah yeah Yeah, so English hard urgent urgent

83
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,820
urgent more urgent things are happening.

84
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:07,040
So yes, yes, one of the things that are on my list of things
to do are like the finishing the voice packs because I still

85
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:16,480
have those I have not forgotten for everybody who got a
custom voice pack and and it's on my list and I I think next

86
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,840
day off I will be able to do it.

87
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:28,420
which was going to be having to do warrior wear but now it's
not warrior wear now i can do the voice packs uh

88
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,900
yes next time we will definitely have a different system for
the voice pack so that this does not happen again so that i

89
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:48,500
can do them all at once and then not have my schedule go to
wacky world and me not have time anymore but i still plan on

90
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,680
having them out by the end of january It's kind of like you
got a whole day back, kind of.

91
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,600
It is, actually.

92
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,340
It was, I was like, oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm losing
my Saturday.

95
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,160

I have a lot of important stuff on my plate too, not nearly
as important as your stuff.

107
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,680
I don't think my stuff is very important.

108
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,840
Well, it's important for like, to do, obviously.

109
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,800
But, you know, it's important to me, but in the grand sense.

Waiting for you to be sponsored for a spicy game.

Thank you!

135
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,170
Watch Takedokie Play MGS really threw you for a loophole.

136
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,770
Thanks so much for joining in.

137
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,570
I'm making such a fun and memorable experience.

138
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,150
Thank you, Next scene, for...

139
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,110
Letting it happen, it's all thanks to you that it happened.

140
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,510
I was talking to her after about it too, just a little bit
because we were both exhausted.

141
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,750
But it was so, oh my gosh, she really liked it.

142
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:47,870
She really, she really appreciated kind of the same things
that I appreciate about the game where it's very serious,

143
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:53,150
where it needs to be, and very funny, where when it's funny,
it's just all around goofy, but also...

144
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,350
It hits, she really got hit by the ending.

145
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,130
So I was like,

146
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,870
did you have a favorite part?

147
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:12,510
I think she said her favorite part being the, wait, I can't
remember what she said on, I was so delirious.

148
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:20,810
I can't remember if she said on stream or not, but it was
the crocodile hat interfering with the scene with Oz a lot.

149
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:31,690
hopped up out of the bed and turned her swag on yeah Jarvis
crank my swag to 100

150
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:42,530
it was so funny every time I don't I think I hope that it
kind of like marinates with her a little bit and she like

151
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:52,210
wants to know more and ends up playing some of the other
games I hope I hope I went to Minto in NSW Australia the

152
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,730
other day i didn't realize how much of an impact you had you
had your own grocery and school and mall and church and

153
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:09,910
daycare and the people of minto the people of minto minto
mean

Aibu must gather there.

157
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,810
Where was I thinking?

158
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,910
I was like, there was a place that I was thinking the other
day.

159
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,790
I was like, oh my gosh, I wanna have an Aibu meet up here.

160
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,230
Wait, I can't remember.

161
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,310
No.

162
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,930
Wait, no, I was like, oh my gosh.

163
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,710
I wanna bring this up and say, Aibu meet up at this place.

164
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,790
What is it?

165
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,750
I can't remember.

166
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,950
I can't remember.

167
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,570
Oh my gosh, I just realized you guys have not been able to
hear the game this entire time.

168
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,650
I'm so sorry.

169
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,670
I'm so sorry.

170
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,010
Oh, jeez.

171
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,310
I might be a little...

172
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,730
I might be a little...

173
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,230
Hello today.

174
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:26,330
Oh!

175
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,450
Cat's up, thank you!

176
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,190
I hope the stream goes well.

177
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,970
I think this chapter might be your favorite.

178
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,850
Oh, I'm excited.

179
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,870
Thanks for playing my favorite game, Alan Wake.

180
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:42,050
It was quite the journey seeing you read the game and you
remember to stay hydrated.

181
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:42,610
Have fun.

182
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,210
Thank you.

183
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,470
Thank you so much for the Akasupa.

184
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,230
Thank you.

185
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:46,790
Thank you.

186
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,230
Thank you.

187
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,810
Thank you.

188
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,870
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

189
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,190
Is this chapter long?

190
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,410
Minto, but then spiders and kangaroos.

191
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,990
Kangaroos are fine.

192
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,010
You gotta worry about them drop bears.

193
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,830
Not as long as last time.

194
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:15,150
I was wondering if maybe of chapters 5, 6 we endurance or
something.

195
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,750
Maybe I will do that next Friday.

196
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,550
And then there's the DLC chapters.

197
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,150
I don't know if I have those.

198
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,270
But...

199
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,910
Uh...

200
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,590
5, 6...

201
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,490
Um, I wonder how long those are, I wonder.

202
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,670
Oh, they come with the remaster.

203
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,490
Oh, they should be in the remaster.

204
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,910
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

205
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,510

00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,660

After, well, let's not talk about after Alan Wake.

220
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,540

00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,860
On Twitter that you posted with the cruise and the Minto to

00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,940
So, fun, fun, fun.

248
00:27:52,680 --> 00:28:01,140
I was talking to somebody else about about Iosis and seeing
if they could do music.

249
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,980
So, when I saw that, when I saw, it was Arm.

250
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,720
Arm that did Narissa's song?

251
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,100
Help me step boo, I'm stuck.

252
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,400
Do you have a preference between the two versions?

253
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,580
Not really.

254
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,620
I think they're both really great.

255
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,920
But, uh, maybe.

256
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,460
Maybe Minto Ios' song one day in the future.

257
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,060
I would love to have that too.

258
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,720
Because it's so fun.

259
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,560
Yeah, they're both both really great.

260
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,240
Narissa always drops banger.

261
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,360
She does.

262
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,360
She does.

263
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,320
This one really cool thing.

264
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:59,700
i'm so grateful that i'm able to do is work with so many
artists and stuff that i love you know like oh my gosh you

265
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:11,740
know loving toho over 10 years ago it's like i would have
never thought 10 years ago that i would have i mean

266
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:17,320
obviously i'm not but even with like a wine and everything i
never would have known i never would have thought that i

267
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:25,520
would get such an opportunity it's honestly like man it's so
it's so crazy it's something that i don't think i'll ever

268
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:41,140
ever ever ever get used to it's something that is just um i
it's the it's the most like amazing feeling do you remember

269
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,300
what got you into toho

270
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:57,120
kind of silly actually like it wasn't even well I did
eventually get into the games but I would frequent a certain

271
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:09,080
image board site called Don Boru and I would be like I would
be like what what are all these why are there always there

272
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:24,420
was always Toho art we know I know you guys know I know you
guys know but like just seeing like constant flow of art and

273
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:35,980
like the characters were so cute and I was just like wow
what is this like Toho project huh huh I Oh, it's so funny.

274
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,940
Is the stream just starting or ending?

275
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,280
Just starting!

276
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,000
I think.

277
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,140
Same and with Azure Lane 2.

278
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,660
I mean, I go on Donburu, like, probably way too often.

279
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,020
But, like, I'm also, like, going for inspiration.

280
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,760
It's a market research.

281
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,700
And also, I have a tab open always for...

282
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,320
Koharu.

283
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,340
And so I just just go and I look.

284
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,260
I'd be shocked if most people haven't gotten into Toho like
that.

285
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,900
Honestly, well, back in the day probably, right?

286
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,560
Looking at the earliest entries of pools on Damburu, you
find they are mostly Toho.

287
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,200
Exactly!

288
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Exactly.

289
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,400
Nira, welcome back.

290
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,240
Thank you.

291
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,960
Thank you.

292
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,520
Thank you.

293
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,960
No research purposes.

294
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,880
Well, That's like one thing that I really love about it is
because of like the tags.

296
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:47,060
If I, okay, for example, if I'm like, okay, I want this kind
of outfit with this kind of hairstyle or something,

297
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,520
something, something.

298
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,880
I can like kind of piece it together by searching through
the tags, you know, like it's so good.

299
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,180
So easy.

300
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,120
Can you make this official mint dojin?

301
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,260
What do you mean?

302
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,440
If I get 1 million subscribers.

303
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,380
If I get 1 million subscribers, I'll do official Minto
Dojin.

304
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,160
I haven't asked Ayami Mama, but I'm sure she'd be fine with
it.

305
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,860
I say that because I don't think it'll ever happen.

306
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,460
So, good luck.

307
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:36,960
Good luck.

308
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:55,880
keep thy word it'll be it'll be like 20 years later and you
guys will be like just you'll be like dust like floating

309
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:12,060
away and you'll be like see see me don't we did it we did it
one million you say calling my friends I have friends in

310
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,120
high places.

311
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,720
Can we have it drawn by you?

312
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,480
I don't think you'd want that.

313
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,040
It would be terrible.

314
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,340
Wouldn't you want...

315
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,040
Wait, are you...

316
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,200
Wait, so do you mean you want a dojin drawn by me?

317
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,760
Not a dojin of me.

318
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,660
Oh!

319
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,660
Maybe we can make that a goal for 2027.

320
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,160
That would be kind of fun.

321
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,960
What if I had my own table?

322
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,100
At Komike.

323
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,480
Wait, that would be crazy.

324
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,210
If I drew...

325
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,670
What kind of Dojinchi would I draw?

326
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,370
Koharu.

327
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,490
No, no, no, no.

328
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,590
Delta, thank you so much for the broadcast!

329
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:09,750
Thank you!

330
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,410
And welcome, welcome back!

331
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,570
Scoop again and welcome back!

332
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,290
Welcome, welcome back!

333
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,090
I need a cute...

334
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,690
Where's your marriage to Doki going?

335
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

336
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,510
Looking through Mince Dojin.

337
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,050
She's really good.

338
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,930
Culture version of Dojin?

339
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,990
Or rated E for everyone?

340
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,890
I think I would have to make two.

341
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,830
I think I would make an E for everyone.

342
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,990
And then also...

343
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,370
Yeah.

344
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:49,170
You guys have to buy my mama's Dojinchi, though.

345
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,670
My mama, Ayami Mama!

346
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,930
You guys have to buy her Dojinchi, and I'll tell you why.

347
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,910
One of her recent ones for, I believe it was for Winter
Comiket.

348
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:05,510
And, you know, obviously this is if you want etchy material.

349
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,570
But there was a...

350
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:39,190
the the do didn't the the do didn't she involved a gamer
girl who maybe maybe maybe she hooked a certain thing to a

351
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:44,370
controller so that when she played the game, the thing
would...

352
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,270
But what's so funny about it is at the end of the Dojin
Shi...

353
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,270
At the end of the Dojin Shi...

354
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,350
Because...

355
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:17,130
She goes into really, like, really detail on how she she
made it right in in the story and then at the end you see my

356
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:28,490
mama actually made it my mama actually made such a
contraption for research my mama is a freak and is the best

357
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:40,550
kind thanks for the sound effect of course isn't that Crazy!

358
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:41,970
Hi, Minto.

359
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:42,450
Hello!

360
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,130
Sorry, I missed some super chats.

361
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,230
Thank you so much, everybody.

362
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:46,850
Thank you!

363
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,790
Minto made the million subs promise, expecting it to never
happen.

364
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,190
No, no, no, no, no.

365
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,690
I just joined.

366
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,070
What the hell are we talking about?

367
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,450
My mama being an artist?

368
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,160
Yeah.

369
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,420
So...

370
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,740
Yeah.

371
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,520
Yeah!

372
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,640
Yeah!

373
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,120
Shall we play the game?

374
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,820
Chapter 4?

375
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,460
Pretty sure that there's this game called Ultra Kill that
also did that.

376
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,440
I heard about that.

377
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,080
My name is Ayami Mama, and I'm a writer.

378
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,940
Yes, officer, the shaped rumble pack is for research
purposes.

379
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,740
It's actually already a pretty good ecosystem for
interfacing games with those kinds of devices.

380
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,700
But my mom, she teaches you how to do it yourself too.

381
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,740
So yes, my mom is just so smart.

382
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,660
She's a genius.

383
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,220
Continue game.

384
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,180
Gragi.

385
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,200
Oh, Gragi.

386
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,200
Gragi.

387
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,080
I felt like this was happening to someone else.

388
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,980
Someone I was watching on television.

389
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,340
I couldn't think.

390
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,860
Couldn't focus.

391
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,020
Gragi.

392
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,760
Gragi.

393
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,340
There were only empty sheets of paper here.

394
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,900
No manuscript pages.

395
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:29,160
only empty sheets what is this the iv

396
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:43,380

398
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:58,400
brave alan sorry i understand your I would be more concerned
if you weren't suspicious of me.

399
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,680
I say sorry, but I know that some of you guys don't mind it.

400
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,280
Big of you.

401
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,400
Now.

402
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,300
Why is he holding his hand like that?

403
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,880
We'll reacquaint you with my clinic and go over everything
you might have forgotten.

404
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,320
Little walk and some fresh air?

405
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:11,860
Yeah?

406
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,420
Yes, it will do you good.

407
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,720
Wait, didn't I punch this guy?

408
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,300
He's Italian.

409
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,260
This corridor is for patients.

410
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,220
Most of them aren't here right now.

411
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,380
Jack took them out for a fishing trip.

412
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,680
Except for the ones who are particularly vulnerable, of
course.

413
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,760
Am I vulnerable?

414
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,780
Hey, Emerson.

415
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,140
This guy likes Night Springs, the video game!

416
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,080
And death rally.

417
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,060
Only half of you is visible.

418
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,160
Why am I bouncing?

419
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,480
Well.

420
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,500
He's Italian.

421
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,380
He's Italian.

422
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,540
I'm going to mess up this guy's room.

423
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,000
room he's gonna come back and be like wait what the heck is
he dark

424
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,940
oh can't go this way no

425
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:27,360
creators dilemma i don't know if like you could go to i mean
i'm not a writer you cannot call me alan wake you can call

426
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:35,680
me mint phantom but i don't think you could go to a retreat
for a writer's block i mean maybe a retreat But like, I

427
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,980
don't know.

428
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,780
I feel like it's such like a deep within, you know, like
it's like a real psychological thing.

429
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,300
I encourage creativity as a part of the recovery process
here at Cauldron Lake Lodge.

430
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,040
I specialize in treating artists.

431
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,720
I bet you do.

432
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,180
Splendid, Alan.

433
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,620
I honestly believe we can get this thing under control if we
work together.

434
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,400
Wake reminds me of myself of many ways.

435
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,660
The greatest being he is willing to do whatever it takes for
his wife who he loves more than ever.

436
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:13,580
anyone who is this guy who is this gorilla i love that i can
oh i was just about to say i love that i could just go into

437
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:23,000
anybody's room okay good sometimes um one thing that's
really funny about

438
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:38,260
um you know just like sometimes people's uh people interpret
games in other ways and just like I don't know especially

439
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:45,460
with Metal Gear I think because there's so much stuff and
also like you know maybe somebody didn't listen to every

440
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,740
single tape or didn't hear every single codec things like
that and but one time I saw a tweet that came across my

441
00:41:51,740 --> 00:42:00,540
timeline that was like I don't remember what the initial
tweet was I think it was talking about like how Kaz is kind

442
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:00,840
of like

443
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:13,700
um but uh i don't know i honestly don't remember what it was
but there was like there was like somebody else like just

444
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:20,900
discussions about it and so i saw i saw a reply of someone
being like yeah but you know what i think we can all agree

445
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:32,820
on is that huey is so bad and huey i think i believe the
theories that he uh killed strange love and i'm like what do

446
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,880
you mean the theories There's a, there's a tape about it.

447
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,520
What do you mean?

448
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,400
We hear it happen.

449
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,520
What do you mean?

450
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,640
That's just a theory.

451
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:01,240
Like, oh, and I was so confused because then other people
were agreeing like, yeah, that guy definitely did it.

452
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,440
Like, I think he did it.

453
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,160
And I'm like.

454
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,800
But he did!

455
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,600
My name is Minto.

456
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm a wait-over.

457
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,240
It's so funny.

458
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,760
The important takeaway is that even people who missed it a
lot...

459
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,540
Oh, missed it?

460
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,500
Still hate Huey.

461
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,660
That's so true!

462
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,100
It's just so funny.

463
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,000
Sorry, little tangent.

464
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,400
Whoa, elevator!

465
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,560
Wait, hold on.

466
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,660
I'll take the stairs.

467
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:52,290
I'm trying to live a healthy life where are the stairs the
allegations remain uncovered don't cheer for that I don't

468
00:43:52,290 --> 00:44:02,990
like the way this bear is sitting all right my theory is
that I see something else happening on a glance whoa whoa

469
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:22,080
sorry I thought my theory about Kai's being Johnny Provost
dad was wild what's this nature now alan from past

470
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,680
experience with you i know i need to get right into the
heart of the matter as quickly as i can alarm sound the

471
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:38,920
alarm so i'm just going to say this alice is dead no no
you're in a very vulnerable state until you understand bugs

472
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,680
buddy meme no alice drown And you couldn't face that.

473
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,440
Ben drowned.

474
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:53,360
You're suffering from hallucinations, paranoid delusions,
unusual thinking, an obsession about light and darkness, a

475
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,980
feeling that everything revolves around you, your thoughts
and dreams.

476
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,380
Yeah, are you calling me self-centered?

477
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,360
Your mind has constructed an elaborate fantasy scenario in
which your writings are affecting reality.

478
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,620
She has been kidnapped and supernatural forces of darkness
are trying to stop you.

479
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:11,920
Okay.

480
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,900
We go this way, Alan.

481
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,380
I wasn't ready for another shot, so I went along with it.

482
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,740
He had to be lying.

483
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,540
But under the influence of the drug he had given me, I had
to fight not to believe his words.

484
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,940
I don't know what to believe anymore.

485
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,220
You've been making it up.

486
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,940
Apart from the tragic accident with your wife, no one has
been killed.

487
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:41,000
Your delusions are just a manifestation of your subconscious
mind trying to protect you from the too painful truth.

488
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:49,900
fight the fantasy it will return i know the instinct is to
resist me but think about it doesn't this make far more

489
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:57,720
sense than the insane supernatural conspiracy you have
concocted in your mind you're a skeptic by nature alan we

490
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:09,520
both know this everything can be explained logically hang on
yes i'm listening wow this looks like somebody is going to

491
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:19,820
fall and die on that thing um why is i don't think it should
be so pointed i'm listening and following

492
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:34,820
he's lying we saw the dark presence yeah never get tired of
this view very inspiring isn't it inspired lake spread below

493
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:40,880
us i could see mirror peak on the other side of the lake i
thought i could make out the spot where diver's aisle had

494
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,100
been when i arrived with alice now there was nothing but
waves there's nothing there yeah Oh.

495
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,320
It seems there's a storm coming.

496
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,460
Storms are coming.

497
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,680
Funny, I don't recall there being a mention of that in the
weather forecast.

498
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,100
Well, no matter.

499
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:56,980
It's the darkness!

500
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,500
This way, follow me.

501
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:00,920
Where are we going?

502
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,700
Alan, what I'm telling you is good news.

503
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,560
Right now we're in control.

504
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:10,200
Every time you have a relapse, it gets more and more
difficult to resurface from the dark depths of your

505
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:10,880
imagination.

506
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,660
Not surprising, considering your profession.

507
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,800
Honey, there's a storm approaching.

508
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:24,600
you work with after all your nightmares this should come as
an immense relief to you if it doesn't why is that because

509
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:32,320
i'm lying or because you don't want to admit that you're not
well it's very natural for you to think of me as your enemy

510
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:40,820
it's part of the i'll let him talk obviously loved his own
voice his words echoed madly inside my head but i dug my

511
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:47,380
nails into the palms of my hands to stay focused you need to
work with me once you accept Except that, we can begin the

512
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,540
journey towards your recovery.

513
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,820
Whop, whop, whop, whop, whop, whop, whop.

514
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:51,900
Come along.

515
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,040
Let's go inside.

516
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,540
Thermos.

517
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:54,820
I see you up.

518
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,960
Who the heck?

519
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,740
Oh, it's that guy over there.

520
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,300
Ah.

521
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,300
Here's the entrance to the office wing.

522
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,700
That's for staff only.

523
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,300
That's where we just came from.

524
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,520
You were impressed by my trophies when you first arrived
here.

525
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,540
I do love to hunt.

526
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,400
Two thermoses.

527
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:36,140
great outdoors man versus nature it's wonderful stuff yoink
if not real why scary scary scary scary scary I gotta go

00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:47,940

bad dream Mr. You should be afraid of me.

529
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,560
Don't want to run into me in the night.

530
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,660
That's for sure.

531
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,300
Oh, my God.

532
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:51,980
Emerson.

533
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,780
Mr. Wake is confused enough as it is.

534
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,560
Another QR code.

535
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,900
Wait, hold on.

536
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,260
Oh.

537
00:48:59,160 --> 00:48:59,800
Where's my phone?

538
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,300
There it is.

539
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,780
Hold on.

540
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,340
I would like to view the video.

541
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,980
So you won't be scared.

542
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,540
But you can't just decide what kind of dream you have or
when you have it.

543
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,000
Hold on.

544
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,140
I have to pause real quick.

545
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,240
Vision 3.

546
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,020
I guess I missed Vision 1.

547
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,740
I don't remember seeing it before.

548
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:22,980
Oh well, okay.

549
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:29,830
It's him.

550
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,070
Sitting in a chair.

551
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:32,750
The mist.

552
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,650
A caldera lake.

553
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:36,870
Silence echoes.

554
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:37,970
Loud.

555
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,610
It's too late to hear the words.

556
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:43,910
The man, naked.

557
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:44,610
Naked!

558
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,690
Crawls to the shore.

559
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:47,150
Like a birth.

560
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,050
Death stranding?

561
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:58,450
to say that would be a lie nothing like a birth the opposite
he's oh it's a tutorial section ah okay a carcass of a deer

562
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:12,190
lies on the shore rotting amidst driftwood the man is afraid
beside himself who is he he doesn't himself know i don't

563
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:20,530
know dark waves have washed it away a blank page where this
horror story will be written He remembers darkness.

564
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,290
He feels the shadow pressing down on him.

565
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:26,470
Oh, sorry.

566
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,250
He must get away.

567
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,230
He runs to the forest.

568
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,710
To a fate worse than death.

569
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,710
Not the forest.

570
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,430
Please get me out of there.

571
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,130
Get me out of the forest, please!

572
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,250
Ducky ducky.

573
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,490
No more forest!

574
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,470
Dr. Hartman is giving Wake a tour of his clinic and
explaining that Alice's death has driven Wake into a dark

575
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,530
inner world of delusions and fantasies.

576
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:59,310
Okay, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.

577
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:02,190
Ew, that's my, that's my.

578
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:04,590
Hartman had mentioned that the power had been acting up.

579
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:08,250
Maybe that was the reason for the generator and the work
light on the balcony.

580
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,590
The generator hadn't been activated, and there was no key.

581
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,810
There's a lot going on downstairs.

582
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:23,830
hoped Alan could be cured of his delusions through
counseling, even though he knew curing his thermos

583
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,770
kleptomania was a lost cause.

584
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,830
Hey, lady.

585
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,350
Kua barra, Kua barra.

586
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:31,650
Oh.

587
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,200
Hi.

588
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,880
You're not gonna hit me, are you?

589
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:40,660
Oh.

590
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,770
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

591
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,610
Oh, my God.

592
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:49,370
Oh.

593
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:51,770
Alan Wake is not even looking at him.

594
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,490
Alan Fight!

595
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,090
Alan Fight!

596
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,350
Who are you?

597
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,830
Now, you might have noticed the typewriter in your room.

598
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,430
You've been writing as a part of the therapy.

599
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:08,370
As soon as you feel up to it, you should continue.

600
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:09,710
Oh, okay.

601
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:11,050

00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,050

The Anderson farm.

00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:24,910
Thank you!

661
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:25,810
Thank you!

662
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,230
A crash course.

663
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,790
All you need to know to get your head right.

664
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,910
You need to find the message.

665
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:34,850
Here, Sonny, here's something for you.

666
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,330
Gave me a rash.

667
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:39,630
I kept it safe from these bastards.

668
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,030
What do you mean a rash?

669
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:41,990
I don't want it then.

670
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:44,950
My head was clearing up.

671
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:48,210
Or according to Hartman, I was sinking back into the
fantasy.

672
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,590
I was convinced he was lying to me.

673
00:57:50,590 --> 00:58:06,210
about everything crazy or not the Andersons made more sense

you go back to your room I I I want to go home okay Okay,

688
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:54,690
good night.

689
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:58,350
They gave me something.

690
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,410
I guess it wasn't.

691
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,950
I thought I could read it.

692
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:04,710
I guess not.

693
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:07,350
Is that a kid?

694
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:10,230
Oh my god, this guy.

695
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,030
He's flipping all the tables!

696
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:17,910
Or the couches!

697
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:18,290
Or the couches!

698
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,190
And they're not there when you wake up.

699
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:23,470
So you can't wake up because I made...

700
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,830
in charge now and I don't wanna disappear.

701
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:33,150
My nightmare is the publisher people who wanna make a
contribution so they can say they made a contribution.

702
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:39,630
And then we end up with mullets in there because they think
mullets are funny, but it wasn't supposed to be about

703
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:41,850
mullets and now it's about mullets.

704
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:48,670
And when it's in slow motion, they call it mullet time
because the numbers came back from marketing that mullet

705
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:50,710
time is the hook we needed to go big.

706
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:52,170
I think this guy's going through it.

707
01:01:53,490 --> 01:02:01,030
kidding they say it all like serial killers with straight
faces and smiles i think this guy is the writers who want to

708
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:08,310
make everything from the characters to the toasters talk
talk talk all the time i think he knows what he's talking

709
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:15,990
about and the writers won't shut up either because they have
feelings too it's a max pain bullet joke because they're not

710
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:17,690
scared is it like bullet time

711
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:31,770
and give the writing a shot huh typewriters in your room you
can get to your room by those stairs wake oh there are

712
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:43,930
stairs wait how I went up the stairs earlier oh this door
here oh something's wrong I'm not myself it's hard to think

713
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:50,310
that there's a shadow inside I knew this was gonna go off I
can only focus on writing everything else is a blur I'm

714
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:59,550
trapped in this cabin I've been for days always dark outside
my editor is real i saw her again she's not human it's not

715
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:06,550
human a dark presence is wearing the old woman's face she
was covered in clinging shadows there's a hole in her chest

716
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:14,350
where her heart should be oh freaky i think i've made a
horrible mistake i don't think i'm any closer to saving

717
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:22,930
alice yeah it's been lying to me yeah you think me to get
the story at once and the story will come true i think so

718
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,630
too I think we're just a little puppet pawn.

719
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,750
Oh, you went, oh, I see how we went, okay.

720
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:33,030
Cool.

721
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:35,710
All right, let's try writing.

722
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,170
Woo, we're writing.

723
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:41,990
The white glare of the blank page in front of me hurt my
eyes.

724
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,770
My hands began to shake uncontrollably.

725
01:03:49,830 --> 01:04:00,970
What if you wrote like something crazy out of like your
genre hey wake you stay here i'm gonna go see what's up you

726
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:08,170
just keep doing what you're doing be cool okay i'm cool i'm

727
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:15,030

could be my only chance of getting out of here we're leaving

728
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:19,330
with the storm there's a storm coming

729
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:25,330
Oh, afraid of the crazy brothers, are ya?

730
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,150
Not so weak now, are we?

731
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:31,630
Oh, wait, what happened?

732
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,070
Oh, things are unraveling fast, aren't they?

733
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:38,530
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, what is going
on?

734
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:39,810
I do wonder.

735
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:40,690
What do you mean?

736
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:41,810
It's my store.

737
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,530
I'm taking it.

738
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,770
Baby Corp, thank you.

739
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:45,810
Investigate the racket.

740
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:46,190
Okay.

741
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:47,250
Let's go.

742
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:47,870
Oh, wait, what's this?

743
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:50,110
We're on a comeback tour, baby.

744
01:04:52,350 --> 01:05:02,050
i swear they gave me oh i'm dumb i just didn't read it okay
hold on zane could feel the poems taking form shaping the

745
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:08,390
poems as he experimented he imagined he could almost feel
the power surging through the keys of the typewriter it

746
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:15,990
exhilarated him but there was fear too if not for his young
assistant amel he would have given it up amel convinced him

747
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,430
otherwise he too went away with words

748
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:35,590
that went missing or whatever but emil that's the guy that's
the doctor the doctor is in cahoots with the darkness Tom's

749
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,630
a.m.

750
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,550
Oh ho

751
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:45,690
ho ho.

752
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:51,830
Hartman kept talking giving Barry the grand tour clearly
proud of the place he went on and on about his hunting

753
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:58,830
trophies and Barry was impressed but he was here on business
he raised his voice cut through the monologue hey Hartman

754
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:05,670
where's Al Hartman stopped in mid-sentence annoyed at the
interruption he nodded at the hulking orderly standing

755
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:15,270
nearby the man smiled and clapped a practice hand on Barry's
shoulder what are they gonna do to Barry oh no oh no Barry

756
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,330
is just trying to look out for it wait actually

757
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:28,570
only one page we can't get that's crazy okay awesome I mean
this bit This chapter is called the truth.

758
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:29,550
Let's go.

759
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:34,950
Yeah!

760
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:36,730
Sinclair looked bad.

761
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:38,130
That wasn't a love tap.

762
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,170
The crazy old fart hit her hard.

763
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:40,790
Oh, okay.

764
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:43,150
If she was one of Hartman's goons, she had it coming.

765
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:46,290
I could get the key at the office wing from Sinclair.

766
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:47,510
Oh, my God!

767
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:48,650
Yoink.

768
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,510
I had to get to Hartman's office.

769
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:52,890
He had taken all my manuscript pages.

770
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:54,570
It's time to pay the piper.

771
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:10,070
maybe you could come out and beat our wrinkled oh whoa look
at the lightning i think the doctor is gonna die on this

772
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:24,070
thing somebody will somebody will they wouldn't have let us
out there without without it happening to the office was it

773
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:30,680
in here you're crazy quiet Barry!

774
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,340
Barry!

775
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:38,760
Why is he hiding behind?

776
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:40,260
Barry?

777
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,500
Barry, man, I'm glad to see you.

778
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,840
We need to get to Hartman's office.

779
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,260
It's right next door.

780
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,240
You okay?

781
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:49,280
Yeah.

782
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,620
I mean, no.

783
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,300
The cops found me a Rose's trailer, but they didn't hassle
me too much.

784
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:55,880
Oh.

785
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,480
I'm obviously a victim in this, and I demanded to be treated
as a victim.

786
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

787
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,320
I'd sue their asses.

788
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

789
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:07,920
Speaking of asses, that fad gave me a real hard time, but I
had no clue where you were.

790
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:09,200
That guy's crazy, Al.

791
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:15,700
But he let me go, and then I get a call from Hartman, that
son of a bitch who tells me you're here, and I should come

792
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,900
pick you up, but when I got here, two goons clobbered me and
stuck me in there.

793
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,400
What's...

794
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,240
What's with a cutout?

795
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:27,080
I stole it from the diner to piss off Rose after what she
did to us.

796
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,420
That'll teach her.

797
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,180
So true.

798
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,200
That's a harsh punishment.

799
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:31,920
Not that good.

800
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:32,900
Now we gotta get going.

801
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,780
Wait, okay, hold on.

802
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,260
What was this office over here?

803
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:39,940
This is a...

804
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,860
Look at the painting.

805
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:41,580
It's crazy.

806
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:43,960
Wait, what's this?

807
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,120
Oh, oh, goodness gracious.

808
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,080
The photo on the wall caught my attention.

809
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:49,900
Why are they...

810
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,700
In it, the clinic staff were standing outside the lodge.

811
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,040
I knew the man next to Hartman.

812
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,320
That is the kidnapper!

813
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,200
Hartman had been playing me all along.

814
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:04,340
And then also, like, why are none of them looking at...

815
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,120
This is just such a bizarre photo.

816
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,520
It's like, Barry, my man, am I glad to see it?

817
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:10,500
Oh, hey, I'm nervous.

818
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:19,500
This looks like someone stuck their models in front of the
building and then took a screenshot of the game.

819
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,660
Like, why is this guy over here?

820
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,640
He's not even...

821
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,460
What is this?

822
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,360
Oh, are these the paintings that this guy has been doing?

823
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:37,900
Because, um...

824
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:42,340
The markings on the tape said they were recordings Hartman
had made at the sessions with his patients.

825
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,780
I saw Alice's name on one of them.

826
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,680
For a moment, I couldn't breathe, right?

827
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:49,580
Whoa.

828
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:51,940
Ooh, spooky.

829
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,000
This one is really freaky.

830
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,220
Ooh.

831
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:01,760
Oh, manuscript.

832
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,440
We read?

833
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:07,820
The truth.

834
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,180
Mott fails Hartman.

835
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,400
Hartman wasn't happy.

836
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,440
Mott could see in his eyes.

837
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,280
He quickly lowered his own.

838
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,620
He had made a mess of it, and he knew it.

839
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,100
The shame of failure was hard to bear.

840
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:27,140
He hadn't expected Wake to say he needed more time, and he
blurted out two days, less than Wake had asked for to show

841
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,140
him who was in charge.

842
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,260
But that wasn't part of Hartman's plan.

843
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,460
The kidnapper.

844
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:40,570
Now, Mrs. Wake, can you tell me about Alan's problems?

845
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:44,010
He's more and more out of control all the time.

846
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,720
He's getting violent.

847
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,140
He's never...

848
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:56,580
Oh, the silhouette painting over there is scary.

849
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:07,650
You're already... Thank you, classmates!

850
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:13,380
Alan doesn't really sleep, waiting at all.

851
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,220
Can't talk to him.

852
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,160
Yes, tell me, Mrs. Wake.

853
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,320
What would you say to him if he'd listened?

854
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:25,800
I don't know.

855
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:33,230
I want to say, I look at you, and it's not you.

856
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:39,950
I don't like that guy much, and now it's all going to go to
hell.

857
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,970
But you don't ever say this.

858
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:46,990
No, no, I've tried, but he's not listening.

859
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:49,170
He's too deep in his own problem.

860
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:51,630
Real Rose Jacket really isn't a drama.

861
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:57,270
I'm so afraid I'm going to lose him, and we're not even
talking anymore.

862
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,370
He doesn't let me in anymore.

863
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:01,450
He just keeps me in the dark.

864
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,620
Oh, it really is.

865
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:09,580
Please help me, Doctor, because I'm at my wits' end.

866
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:14,140
Well, if you can just get him here, I'll absolutely do my
very best.

867
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,260
Yeah, but, Doctor, you need to be careful with me.

868
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,120
I'm stoked.

869
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:20,180
He's not just going to listen to you and cooperate.

870
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,820
He's the most stubborn man I've ever met.

871
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,100
Well, I'll be sure to bear that in mind.

872
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:30,040
Hearing her voice, what she was saying made me happy and
sick and guilty all at once.

873
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:39,740
worst of all I recognize the words the phone called from her
it had been a cut up of this just a recording that's right

874
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:56,480
oh my gosh when she called before that's right oh my god I
could draw a pee pee on his blackboard okay I'm guessing we

875
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:03,780
can't go through here yeah okay so there was a door in here
Oh my god, Barry, you scared me for a second.

876
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:04,800
The

877
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:12,110
thickest plotting is happening.

878
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:12,870
Oh, yeah.

879
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:14,390
And more.

880
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:21,620
Oh, no.

881
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:23,320
Alan, please.

882
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,020
You're sliding back into the...

883
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:27,360
Tell me one more lie and I'll shoot you in the face.

884
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:28,820
Oh, yeah.

885
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,800
Ah, well, it was worth a shot.

886
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:32,520
Dang!

887
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:33,560
He caved!

888
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,640
Come on, let's work together on this.

889
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,100
You have no idea.

890
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,340
Wait, no, Barry, get out of here.

891
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,300
I'll catch up with you.

892
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,720
Wait, no, Barry, don't leave me.

893
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,020
Oh, ow, let's just...

894
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:47,080
No!

895
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,000
Wake, listen to me.

896
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,460
This is a mistake.

897
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,140
Don't you see?

898
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,480
Together we can create something absolutely wonderful.

899
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,580
With your ability and mine.

900
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:02,780
Oh, no.

901
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,020
Oh, shoot!

902
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:16,340
Alan Flea?

903
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,260
What the?

904
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:18,600
What was that smile?

905
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:19,720
Oh shoot.

906
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:20,660
Oh god.

907
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,140
Wait.

908
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,020
The dark presence will be on me in a moment.

909
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,000
I had to find a way out.

910
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:27,500
Ah!

911
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,040
Oh, open the lock.

912
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:31,940
Oh.

913
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,680
Not good.

914
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,340
Run, run.

915
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:38,460
Woo!

916
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,760
Not good.

917
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,080
This way?

918
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:44,800
way.

919
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,580
Not this way.

920
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:48,420
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

921
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:50,520
The possessed of bookshelves.

922
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,320
Oh, shoot.

923
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:54,420
Um, is there a flashlight somewhere?

924
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:55,300
Ouch, ouch!

925
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,640
Oh, shoot.

926
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,160
Um.

927
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,860
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

928
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,020
This is the only lamp available.

929
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:05,280
Everything is, all the furniture is coming.

930
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,500
Oh, I know the generator up here.

931
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:11,810
Oh!

932
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:12,250
Oops.

933
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:13,330
I did not mean to do that.

934
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:19,210
Oh.

935
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:22,910
Sorry, I'm remembering how to play the game.

936
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:32,910
Holy cow!

937
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:34,970
Holy cow!

938
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:35,690
We

939
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:48,430
can go, we can go.

940
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:49,170
Ouch!

941
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:50,470
Ouch, ouch!

942
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:54,790
Oh my god.

943
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,110
Oh, I'm trapped.

944
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:59,850
I'm not trapped anymore.

945
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:01,850
Pick up the flare.

946
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:05,390
Keep going, keep going.

947
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:06,050
Keep running.

948
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:06,670
Eee!

949
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:07,750
Ah!

950
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:09,610
Ouch!

951
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:10,290
Oh my god.

952
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:11,730
I'm getting hit by everything.

953
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:17,790
Uh...

954
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:19,470
Uh...

955
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:20,470
Oh, there's a door.

956
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:23,050
Wait, no, this is the door I came from.

957
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:25,650
Um...

958
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:28,980
Um...

959
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:29,980
Oh wait, I got the flare.

960
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:30,480
Duh.

961
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:31,860
Uh, how do I use it?

962
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:31,980
B?

963
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:32,840
Uh, shoot.

964
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:34,480
Oh, dang it.

965
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:34,880
This.

966
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:42,940
Yes.

967
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,140
Yes, on my manuscript page.

968
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:54,260
I'm just gonna keep on running.

969
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:54,920
Running.

970
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,320
Oh, can I read real quick?

971
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,740
I'm gonna take that as a nuke.

972
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,100
Wait, what's over here?

973
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:04,400
Oh my god.

974
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,460
A bunch is happening.

975
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,300
Okay, we can read.

976
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,120
Hartman watches wake fall.

977
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,580
Hartman followed the fall of Alan Wake with his binoculars.

978
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:21,420
When the rider hit the water, he ordered Jack to take the
boat to him.

979
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:25,560
The spot was easy to see in the dark, even with all the
extra lights in the boat.

980
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,620
The flare floated and kept burning even in the water.

981
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,980
Jack turned the radio ladder as the engine sputtered.

982
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,940
The music was rough and clanking.

983
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,800
My flare in the water.

984
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:36,980
Something the Anderson brothers would no doubt have enjoyed.

985
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,940
But Hartman chose to ignore it.

986
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,900
Wake was finally within his reach.

987
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:51,460
This was, this was, uh, um, uh, Yes, the, uh, with the
darkness got the kidnapper, but didn't get us.

988
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,220
Hartman knew we was no creator.

989
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,280
He had no ambitions on that front.

990
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:01,100
And he certainly didn't want to end up like every artist he
had worked with here, damaged in ways that were hard to

991
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,500
describe or worse.

992
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,820
It was enough for Hartman to maintain creative control and
provide direction.

993
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:11,020
To be a producer, that was what most of these people were in
need of anyway.

994
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,480
Of course, suitable subjects were few and far in between.

995
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:17,560
Yeah, because he had the flare.

996
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,720
That's the way I think it was that one scene.

997
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,180
Because he had the flare and he went down into the water
with it.

998
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,780
Alright, back to the chaos.

999
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,500
Um, was this?

1000
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,400
Oh, oh, geez.

1001
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,320
Oh, can I get through here?

1002
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,300
Ouch, oh, oh, excuse me.

1003
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,400
Ouch, oh, geez, ow, excuse me.

1004
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:43,760
My heckin...

1005
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:45,700
Oh no.

1006
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,400
Oh no, it's a ball.

1007
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:48,860
Oh no.

1008
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,000
Wait, no, no, please.

1009
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:52,300
Oh!

1010
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:56,620
Oh, this looks possessed.

1011
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,380
Oh, please ball.

1012
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,940
I don't know ball.

1013
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:02,220
I don't know ball.

1014
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:04,860
Was there a flare?

1015
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,180
I could not see if there was.

1016
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,360
I think we have to wait for it to break the door.

1017
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,420
Maybe I could go before it breaks the door.

1018
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:19,880
Um, evil ball, evil ball.

1019
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,780
Okay, it does break the door.

1020
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,740
Okay, maybe, maybe this.

1021
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,360
I didn't see any more flares.

1022
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:31,600
Oh my gosh.

1023
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,660
Don't come in here, please.

1024
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:35,200
Okay.

1025
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,900
Go, go, go!

1026
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,620
How do I run again?

1027
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,500
Oh my gosh, why am I forgetting how to...

1028
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,340
There we go.

1029
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:42,340
Okay.

1030
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,020
Somewhere.

1031
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:45,500
Flare.

1032
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:46,020
Somewhere.

1033
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:47,340
Flare.

1034
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:48,140
Somewhere!

1035
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:49,480
Oh, jeez.

1036
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:55,600
Where is it?

1037
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:55,920
Wait!

1038
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,340
Oh, can I get it to hit this door?

1039
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,160
Actually, let's see.

1040
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:02,900
Run!

1041
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:04,980
Yeah!

1042
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,340
Go, go, go!

1043
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,720
Ow, ow!

1044
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:09,440
I'm here!

1045
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,180
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

1046
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:18,170
Breathe?

1047
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:21,170
Suspended.

1048
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:22,450
Lauren Miller.

1049
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,110
I'm kidding.

1050
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:25,270
Okay, hold on.

1051
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:26,590
There's gotta be stuff around.

1052
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:31,750
You don't understand, Barry.

1053
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,700
They're very important to me.

1054
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:37,870
You don't understand, Barry.

1055
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:39,370
I know.

1056
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,650
I know where you are.

1057
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:41,690
Please.

1058
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:42,870
Understand.

1059
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:44,690
It's part of my psychosis.

1060
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,570
Let's not go over there.

1061
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:50,490
Okay.

1062
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,090
There's like a light over here.

1063
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,490
Just exploring real quick.

1064
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,160
What is this anyway?

1065
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,060
Just an area.

1066
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,160
Ah!

1067
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:05,760
What's this?

1068
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:07,420
Batteries!

1069
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,400
He's gonna give me the flashlight maybe?

1070
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,120
Alright, come here.

1071
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:14,740
I found the car, but the gate's locked.

1072
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:15,220
No!

1073
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:17,080
You're gonna have to go through the hedge maze over there!

1074
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:17,680
No.

1075
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,020
Barry, I don't have a light.

1076
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:20,600
Take this out!

1077
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,380
Oh, no.

1078
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,300
Oh, not a hedge maze!

1079
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,600
Oh god!

1080
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,040
Look at the house, Ow!

1081
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:26,940
Look out!

1082
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,260
Holy cow!

1083
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,740
Ouch, ouch!

1084
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:51,700
Is this...

1085
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,520
Oh, the gate, okay.

1086
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,080
Oh my gosh.

1087
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:56,820
Oh my god.

1088
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,780
I'm just gonna let it happen.

1089
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:06,440
Slow.

1090
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:10,820
Oh, okay.

1091
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,320
That should be enough, right?

1092
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:18,840
Um...

1093
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,720
Can I not climb the gate?

1094
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,780
Right, that's the one that's right there?

1095
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,240
The gate?

1096
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,560
That's like...

1097
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:30,000
Within... Could I not climb up here?

1098
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,080
There's even a rock to help me up.

1099
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:35,900
Just... Raise your arms!

1100
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,540
Raise your arms, Alan!

1101
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:42,160
Oh my god, he has no upper body strength at all.

1102
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:46,000
Remember he sold those thermoses, but only in Finland.

1103
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:46,620
No!

1104
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,880
Also, I just realized I didn't pick up the flare.

1105
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:50,680
Okay, good.

1106
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,100
I have to go through a hedge maze!

1107
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:55,780
This sounds like torture.

1108
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:56,740
I'm not gonna lie.

1109
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,540
Wait a second.

1110
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,080
This sounds like...

1111
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,380
This sounds like...

1112
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:10,540
actual torture right now.

1113
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:17,510
Oh god.

1114
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:19,790
Evil guys.

1115
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:25,450
Maybe I'm going the right way because they spoke to me.

1116
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,350
Ah!

1117
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:31,870
Oh, I don't know why I shot.

1118
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:38,120
Alan loot.

1119
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:39,680
Um.

1120
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:41,860
Ah!

1121
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:42,940
Oh my god.

1122
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,180
Please, uh, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x!

1123
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,140
Okay, proceeding through the garden.

1124
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:59,020
I don't like this at all, you guys.

1125
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,520
I don't like...

1126
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,480
I don't like this at all!

1127
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:30,110
Gosh.

1128
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:35,970
I can hear that!

1129
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:37,330
Sorry.

1130
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:46,910
Shit!

1131
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:49,930
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

1132
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,480
Oh my god.

1133
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,340
No, this guy.

1134
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:26,790
I'm so scared.

1135
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:28,910
I'm scared.

1136
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,680
Who is that talking though?

1137
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:51,810
Who got possessed and weirdo?

1138
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:54,200
I became a weirdo!

1139
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:55,760
I became a weirdo!

1140
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,540
I feel like though I should go back in.

1141
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,840
Is there other stuff that I should get in there, I wonder?

1142
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,900
What is that sound?

1143
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,260
Mito Breeze!

1144
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,000
I'm freaking out, guys!

1145
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,460
Other pages are in there.

1146
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:19,820
Right?

1147
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,000
I did get a check- Oh, there's Al!

1148
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:23,840
I mean, I've been buried, sorry.

1149
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,900
I did get a checkpoint.

1150
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:27,920
Let's go.

1151
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,820
Where did I come from?

1152
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:34,560
I don't even...

1153
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,980
Oh, God, I get lost again!

1154
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:37,960
Wait, wait, wait.

1155
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,120
I didn't go this way.

1156
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:40,160
Okay.

1157
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:42,360
Oh, God.

1158
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,040
Let's do it.

1159
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,030
This way.

1160
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:52,410
This way.

1161
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:55,870
Okay.

1162
01:26:57,930 --> 01:26:58,650
Okay.

1163
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:00,550
We can leave.

1164
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:01,790
Go, go, go, go.

1165
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:06,350
Go, go.

1166
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:07,330
Okay.

1167
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:09,890
Get out of here.

1168
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:11,010
Okay.

1169
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:14,470
Let's read.

1170
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:16,770
Holy.

1171
01:27:17,290 --> 01:27:22,630
I stared at the Viking paraphernalia that littered the area
surrounding an unlikely centerpiece.

1172
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:30,170
A full side stage complete with an impressive sound system
with all the trimmings including a dragon it took a special

1173
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:36,830
kind of crazy to build something like this in a remote field
when the sky split open with a deafening boom and the music

1174
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:46,730
started blasting it felt strangely appropriate what 10 out
of 10 on the acting but you're not really scared right

1175
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:58,170
hartman and the power failure hartman hurried down the
corridor he had disliked leaving wake when he was surely at

1176
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:05,410
his most susceptible to therapy but this was not an ordinary
storm wake had been riding and he had woken something up in

1177
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:12,470
the depths of the lake now it was coming for him whoa
hartman had naturally prepared for a situation like this the

1178
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:17,950
idiot brothers would keep wake distracted while hartman
double checked everything just to be sure no they kept me

1179
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:26,770
distracted wait no i mean they could never be scared yeah
wait i just realized because i got the checkpoint here

1180
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:31,930
Oh, those are like mushrooms or something.

1181
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,870
I thought they were flares.

1182
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:35,430
Because I got the checkpoint here,

1183
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,450
I...

1184
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,560
If I die, I have to...

1185
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,680
Oh, there's graphical glitches.

1186
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:50,560
Those weren't...

1187
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,500
Did you guys say those two?

1188
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,440
My monitors have been a little weird today.

1189
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:55,440
But, uh...

1190
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,700
I'll have to go get that page again.

1191
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,260
I'll

1192
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,340
be nice and calm.

1193
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:10,800
All day long.

1194
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:13,260
Two pills in the morning.

1195
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:24,610
Three pills in the evening.

1196
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:26,870
Oh, it's this guy.

1197
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:28,850
Oh, shoot.

1198
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:31,670
The birds.

1199
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:41,040
Gosh, this is hard.

1200
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:52,840
Ah.

1201
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,400
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch.

1202
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:57,360
Ouch!

1203
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,380
Ouch, Ouch, Ouch.

1204
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:00,640
Ouch!

1205
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:05,000
Shoot, shoot!

1206
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:20,670
Wait, is this?

1207
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:21,090
No.

1208
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:25,170
Ouch, Ouch, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh My God.

1209
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:27,550
Oh my God, this is hard.

1210
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:28,230
Ouch!

1211
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:28,870
Out of ammo!

1212
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:30,010
What do you mean out of ammo?

1213
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:32,470
Oh!

1214
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:40,490
Holy cow!

1215
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:43,530
Holy cow!

1216
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:45,330
Oh my gosh, I almost didn't make it.

1217
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:49,370
Ammo!

1218
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:51,490
They're good!

1219
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:52,670
They're both!

1220
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:56,350
Those birds are crazy, man.

1221
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:03,990
Clutch, barely, for real though.

1222
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:05,810
Holy cow.

1223
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:12,280
Oh, she's the one who knocks.

1224
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,100
I am the one who knocks.

1225
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,580
What the hell?

1226
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:27,360
Oh, jeez.

1227
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:28,440
No, no.

1228
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:34,420
Oh, shoot.

1229
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,560
Oh, no, please.

1230
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:44,600
Oh, no.

1231
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:45,740
Um.

1232
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:55,460
Uh.

1233
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,120
I don't want to waste it.

1234
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:01,940
Oh,

1235
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:15,790
this is bad.

1236
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:19,530
I'm like, I'm, I'm, what's the word?

1237
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:20,630
I'm,

1238
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:30,340
it's like I'm self-sabotaging myself.

1239
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,260
No, not checkpoint!

1240
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:34,660
Oh, geez.

1241
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,040
Holy.

1242
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,160
Holy cow.

1243
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:50,800
Yeah, this should help.

1244
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:52,820
Nope, we only have six, but...

1245
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,580
Mott in charge.

1246
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,460
Mott knew that Wake was smarter than him.

1247
01:32:59,080 --> 01:32:59,720
Wake had more money.

1248
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:00,740
A beautiful wife.

1249
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,340
Everything.

1250
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,440
And Hartman said Wake was important.

1251
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:04,940
That made him better than Mott.

1252
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,060
But Mott was calling the shots now.

1253
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:11,940
He'd expected Wake to whimper and grovel, but instead, he
seemed willing to fight.

1254
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,220
Mott knew he'd gotten under Wake's skin.

1255
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:16,260
If only Mott actually had his wife.

1256
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:17,980
The thought made him shiver.

1257
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:20,380
Yeah.

1258
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:23,160
I have a beautiful wife.

1259
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:27,300
I'm Alan Wake, and my wife is beautiful.

1260
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:28,740
And I have money.

1261
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:30,260
What the heck?

1262
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:37,650
I'm quite nervous.

1263
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:42,550
I'm quite nervous, guys.

1264
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,210
I have seven batteries.

1265
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:47,270
We're blowing through these.

1266
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:48,570
I have no flare.

1267
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,220
Oh, jeez.

1268
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:05,600
Oh my god, I'm so screwed.

1269
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:06,580
I'm so screwed.

1270
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:07,720
Oh my god.

1271
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:08,420
Why not?

1272
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:08,780
Shoot!

1273
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,020
I need to shoot!

1274
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:12,680
Ah!

1275
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:13,940
Oh my god, I'm dead.

1276
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:15,340
I

1277
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,060
have bullets again!

1278
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:22,060
What?

1279
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,160
The game girl gave me bullets.

1280
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:27,940
Wait, why?

1281
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,240
It's kind of awesome.

1282
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:31,600
No flare though.

1283
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,760
Thanks, game.

1284
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:37,460
Okay.

1285
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:41,480
I wish I had any flair though.

1286
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:44,200
Oh dang, there's so many of these guys.

1287
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,760
Soft lock protection, it must be right.

1288
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,400
What if I go around?

1289
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:12,620
Oh shoot, run, run!

1290
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:13,580
Yeah.

1291
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:14,940
Oh geez.

1292
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,160
Get him, get him, get him.

1293
01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:33,470
When I'm not like...

1294
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:39,610
When I'm not ambushed and caught off my guard, I at least
can be prepared a little bit.

1295
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:41,390
A little bit more.

1296
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:43,870
Ugh.

1297
01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:47,390
But man, when they get me, they get me good.

1298
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:49,630
I get my...

1299
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,080
They get me good!

1300
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:58,100
Oh, the music's off.

1301
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:08,700
Again.

1302
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,420
Did that last one get you?

1303
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:16,260
I hate that we've introduced...

1304
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:19,440
What the hell is this stinking garden?

1305
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:23,880
It's actually kind of awesome if we weren't being attacked
at every corner.

1306
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:25,960
It would be awesome.

1307
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,180
The truth.

1308
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,260
Barry attacked by a...

1309
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:31,740
Taken?

1310
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:35,080
For the moment, Barry was just glad he had survived the
fall.

1311
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:39,040
He had been separated from Al, and there was no easy way to
climb back up.

1312
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:39,480
The fall?

1313
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:41,060
He told himself he'd be okay.

1314
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,300
Okay in the gloomy forest at night.

1315
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,880
He would just have to wait for a while for Al to find his
way down.

1316
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:50,680
Barry turned when he heard the heavy footsteps and saw the
movement.

1317
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,640
The man-shaped shadow lunged at him from the bushes.

1318
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:54,980
An axe held high.

1319
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:57,060
Barry screamed and threw up his hand.

1320
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:58,680
The world exploded.

1321
01:36:59,200 --> 01:36:59,680
Exploded?

1322
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:01,540
Figuratively?

1323
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,120
Literally.

1324
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,900
Please explain.

1325
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,080
Yes, yes, yes.

1326
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:21,540
The world exploded.

1327
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,560
Everybody clapped.

1328
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:27,860
Okay, proceed through the garden.

1329
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:28,580
You know what?

1330
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:31,780
I did say I didn't want to be in the woods anymore.

1331
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:34,900
And the game hurt us.

1332
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:35,940
Okay.

1333
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:00,380
The game took it very personally, yeah.

1334
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:01,720
I knew it.

1335
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:03,760
I knew there was going to be something over here.

1336
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:09,860
Uh, yellow.

1337
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:11,160
Ah, I see it!

1338
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,400
Yellow.

1339
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:17,400
Yellow.

1340
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:20,860
Uh.

1341
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:30,730
But for now...

1342
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:32,010
Alright.

1343
01:38:34,170 --> 01:38:34,630
Whoa.

1344
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:35,550
Whoa!

1345
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:38,330
Just looking at everything is so cool.

1346
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:39,190
Sorry.

1347
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:42,490
I get caught up by the scenery.

1348
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:46,970
No ambush, right?

1349
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:52,330
Where do I go?

1350
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:52,730
Oh.

1351
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:53,830
There are stairs?

1352
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:54,950
Okay, there's stairs here.

1353
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:58,790
It's just these kinds of guard...

1354
01:38:58,870 --> 01:39:01,610
Like, when you think about it, it's like this garden is so
funny.

1355
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:04,630
Like, it's literally, like, a one-way garden.

1356
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:05,570
You know what I mean?

1357
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:11,030
Like, if it weren't for all the darkness taken here, this
place might actually be quite therapeutic.

1358
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:12,230
I know, right?

1359
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:18,900
Like, oh, there it!

1360
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,160
This place would be awesome.

1361
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:34,620
My favorite kind of video game setting.

1362
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:38,760
Hartman's Sedates Wake.

1363
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:39,580
Oh, man.

1364
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:40,240
Spoilers.

1365
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:42,540
Hartman watched as Wake's features slackened.

1366
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:44,580
The man was bullheaded, no doubt.

1367
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:48,440
Even lying on the bed, he'd almost broken Hartman's nose
this second time.

1368
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:48,940
Oh, then!

1369
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,020
But with a little time, he could break Wake down.

1370
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,620
Give him proper direction.

1371
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:55,760
Wake was easily the most promising subject he had had.

1372
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:57,540
Well, since Tom really.

1373
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,600
Sleep well, Alan, Hartman whispered with a smile.

1374
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:02,260
Let me take care of you.

1375
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,100
He sniffed hard to clear his throbbing nose, swallowed
blood, and barely tasted it.

1376
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:07,560
Ew!

1377
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:08,380
Ew!

1378
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,360
Ew!

1379
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:10,180
Ew!

1380
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:10,300
Ew!

1381

1384
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:46,990
Oh, you're alive.

1385
01:40:47,930 --> 01:40:48,670
Let's get out of here.

1386
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:49,870
Can you open this gate?

1387
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:53,030
Very.

1388
01:40:54,090 --> 01:41:00,270
Uh, well, I slammed it shut when the nasty showed up and the
key fits kind of loose in the lock.

1389
01:41:00,550 --> 01:41:01,290
So, uh...

1390
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:07,790
Don't worry about it.

1391
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:09,790
Oh, neat.

1392
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:10,250
Oh, no.

1393
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:11,310
Oh.

1394
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:13,230
Oh, no.

1395
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:15,710
Oh, no.

1396
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:17,950
Oh no!

1397
01:41:19,870 --> 01:41:20,070
Alright.

1398
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:23,270
It's one of these again.

1399
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:24,910
No, stinking way.

1400
01:41:30,730 --> 01:41:30,850
Okay.

1401
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:31,710
Ah!

1402
01:41:32,270 --> 01:41:32,670
Sorry.

1403
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:38,860
Oh, I have a shotgun.

1404
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:39,900
Okay.

1405
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,340
That's so awesome for you!

1406
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:05,220
Oh shit.

1407
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,060
Oh my god.

1408
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:16,680
Oh my god, please.

1409
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:17,860
Ah!

1410
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,380
Oh, sorry.

1411
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:30,320
Please tell me we're headed for the nearest.

1412
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:31,980
You're now leaving Bright Falls.

1413
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:33,340
Come back soon, sign.

1414
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,400
We're going to the Anderson farm.

1415
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,360
I knew you were gonna say something like that.

1416
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:37,980
You know what?

1417
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:39,680
You owe me big time for this.

1418
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,980
When this is through, the cutout is so funny.

1419
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:42,840
How does girls?

1420
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:43,260
I don't care what anyone says.

1421
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:44,560
I'm done with darkness.

1422
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:47,980
You're gonna buy me a tanning bed as a gift, and I'm gonna
live in it.

1423
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,720
Oh my god, it was...

1424
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,440
It was so scary.

1425
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,180
One day the Minto cutout is going to be there.

1426
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:02,660
You could just, uh, you can, uh, buy the game.

1427
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,240
To make the Minto cutout.

1428
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:08,340
Holy cow!

1429
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,320
I'm crazy, but that's fine, Barry.

1430
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,060
You got that right now.

1431
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,480
You're barking mad.

1432
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,680
You are by far the craziest...

1433
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:21,120
But maybe that's inevitable when you deal with crazy stuff
like this.

1434
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,080
It helps.

1435
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,580
Alice they never had Alice.

1436
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:32,440
She's trapped in the darkness at the bottom of the lake, but
she's not dead Ow, how can you know that I know Barry I can

1437
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,900
how I look at the road.

1438
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:40,840
I can bring her back I can find her there's something
special about this place the lake it it does something to

1439
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:43,440
the works of art created here It makes them come.

1440
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:49,800
Why don't you just write something that says like darkness
go away Wife in my arms kissing smooching.

1441
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:50,800
That's why all of this is happening.

1442
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:57,320
It's using my manuscript to take over I believe you it
happened to Thomas saying before it happened to the

1443
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:02,220
Andersons I believe you crazy or not You're not delusional
weird shit's going down.

1444
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:02,900
That's a fact.

1445
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:04,140
Yeah, I'm on board man.

1446
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,100
I'm with you Yeah, the Andersons knew about it.

1447
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:10,280
They were too far gone to tell me with all the drugs They
were on but they wrote it down.

1448
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,300
There's a message somewhere at their farm, Barry.

1449
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:13,960
We just need to find it.

1450
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,260
That's what they wrote down

1451
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:26,410
At their farm Oh!

1452
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:27,070
Oh, no.

1453
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:28,410
Oh, am I back in the woods?

1454
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,400
The woods.

1455
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:42,130
Holy.

1456
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:44,590
I lost my gun in the crash.

1457
01:44:44,730 --> 01:44:44,950
Oh, no.

1458
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:46,670
Barry was nowhere to be seen.

1459
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:48,510
Uh-oh.

1460
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:49,790
I heard him, though.

1461
01:44:50,130 --> 01:44:50,510
Barry!

1462
01:44:52,650 --> 01:44:53,090
Barry!

1463
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:55,170
Oh, man, you're okay!

1464
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:57,790
Jeez, it's good to hear your voice!

1465
01:44:58,230 --> 01:45:01,090
I was trying to get out of the car, but the ground gave way.

1466
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:03,270
Man, what a drop!

1467
01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:04,290
Don't worry.

1468
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:05,750
Your cutout is fine.

1469
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:07,530
Oh, I see him.

1470
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:08,210
Are you okay?

1471
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:10,110
I hit some bushes.

1472
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:11,650
Didn't get a scratch.

1473
01:45:12,130 --> 01:45:13,950
There's no way you can climb down, though.

1474
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:15,610
It's like a sheer wall.

1475
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:18,010
We could... We could do that.

1476
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:19,450
Just kind of...

1477
01:45:19,450 --> 01:45:21,570
Oh, there's something moving down here.

1478
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:23,190
Mary, it's a taken.

1479
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:24,670
Use a flare, Barry.

1480
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:28,410
Oh, yeah!

1481
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:29,230
Yeah!

1482
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:30,290
Barry, are you alright?

1483
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:33,030
I'm good, Al.

1484
01:45:33,490 --> 01:45:34,210
I'm great.

1485
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:37,730
Guess you never messed with anyone from New York City
before, huh?

1486
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:38,590
Ah, yeah.

1487
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:42,210
Is that their farm?

1488
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:44,130
I can find your way around to the farm, Al.

1489
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:45,270
I'll be waiting.

1490
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:45,930
Nice.

1491
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:47,750
Wait, but we have nothing.

1492
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:49,610
Barry, just wait for me, okay?

1493
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:51,970
Al, I'm not staying here.

1494
01:45:52,110 --> 01:45:52,770
It's suicide.

1495
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:53,850
I'm going to the farm.

1496
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:56,750
I'm going to go ahead and secure the area.

1497
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:57,970
You can catch up.

1498
01:45:58,490 --> 01:45:59,590
Don't worry about it.

1499
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:00,850
I'm on the case.

1500
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:02,570
Now he's Rambo.

1501
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:03,430
He's got the...

1502
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:04,250
cut out!

1503
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:10,610
He's got the cut out!

1504
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:19,480
Go!

1505
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:20,100
Go, Barry!

1506
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:21,860
You can't do it!

1507
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:23,180
I'm

1508
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:37,530
so glad he's wearing like the brightest red jacket ever.

1509
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:41,140
Harry!

1510
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:45,180
Oh, he waits there.

1511
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:45,960
Okay.

1512
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:48,860
Now we know how to get to him.

1513
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:49,860
Or rather, we know how to get to him.

1514
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:50,880
Where he's waiting for us.

1515
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:53,600
Okay, that's so funny.

1516
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:58,440
Oh my god, that's so cute.

1517
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:04,620
I feel like we definitely could like slide down the wall,
but that's just me.

1518
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:14,610
You think that's gonna deter me, huh?

1519
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:17,990
Alan jump!

1520
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:20,690
Alan spooked!

1521
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:22,110
Alan scared!

1522
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:23,830
Oh, Alan!

1523
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:27,650
Alan, um...

1524
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:27,930
Alan,

1525
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,420
Alan, go to the generator!

1526
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,800
Alan to the light!

1527
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:40,820
Alan to the light!

1528
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,240
Alan turn on!

1529
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,480
Oh, Alan...

1530
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:45,320
Wrong direction.

1531
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:46,440
Wait.

1532
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,880
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1533
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:50,980
Can I turn it or something?

1534
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:53,360
Oh my gosh, this is so bad.

1535
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:54,560
Uh...

1536
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:54,760
Ow!

1537
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:58,600
Alan die.

1538
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:00,280
Alan die.

1539
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:07,390
Dodge them, ma'am.

1540
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:09,930
I'm doing my very bestest, I promise you.

1541
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:12,970
Oh, maybe bestest is like...

1542
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:22,550
Maybe bestest is not the best word.

1543
01:48:23,650 --> 01:48:24,830
I think I could do better.

1544
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:27,890
But I'm panicking, okay?

1545
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:32,170
What do we got?

1546
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:37,430
Walter at the Anderson house.

1547
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:44,290
farm when he stopped the car at the Anderson farm Walter
felt relieved oblivion was close at hand the brothers

1548
01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:50,470
wouldn't miss a jar of moonshine or two in the booby hatch
but then he saw the man on the porch and he knew who it was

1549
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:56,410
driving for his life and knowing it was useless he didn't
realize he was crying until he couldn't see the road for the

1550
01:48:56,410 --> 01:49:03,470
tears what he sees Barry I

1551
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:11,340
feel naked without anything.

1552
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,240
How could the game do this to me?

1553
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,420
Let's see a thermos.

1554
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:31,630
I'm like trying to see if there's any place that I could
find a gun at?

1555
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:32,670
Oh my gosh.

1556
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:34,170
A hole!

1557
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:36,750
I know!

1558
01:49:36,930 --> 01:49:37,390
I know!

1559
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:39,600
Oh my god!

1560
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:40,000
Please!

1561
01:49:43,930 --> 01:49:44,870
Come in here!

1562
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:47,550
Come in here!

1563
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:48,450
Oh my god.

1564
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:51,090
Uh, this is not gonna go well, is it?

1565
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:57,330
Come in here!

1566
01:49:58,870 --> 01:49:59,170
Oh!

1567
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:02,090
But somehow it worked.

1568
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:03,090
Let's go.

1569
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:06,250
They're like a whole dumpster.

1570
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:10,890
This part sucks.

1571
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:13,470
I'm naked.

1572
01:50:14,430 --> 01:50:15,270
Without anything.

1573
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:16,670
And I'm scared.

1574
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:18,010
I'm naked and afraid.

1575
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:33,570
I'm afraid I'm like gonna miss a gun and then they're gonna
summon you know like um Jesus Yeah I know I know that

1576
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:38,930
they're gonna summon the guys and I'm not gonna have
anything Because I'll accidentally miss something you know

1577
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:45,770
Come in here it's so bright Come in here

1578
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:53,580
Yeah like if I go the wrong way you know

1579
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:57,720
Um...

1580
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:58,740
Where did it go?

1581
01:50:59,420 --> 01:51:01,020
Stop blinking like that.

1582
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,900
Hurt my eyes.

1583
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:02,500
Okay, whatever.

1584
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:03,820
Let's just keep going.

1585
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:07,380
Aw, man.

1586
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:09,760
Alan jump!

1587
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:11,080
Alan?

1588
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:12,180
Oh, no!

1589
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:14,640
Ouch!

1590
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:15,140
Ouch!

1591
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:16,500
Alan run.

1592
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:24,360
Oh, gosh.

1593
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:25,880
Oh my god!

1594
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,920
Oh my god, all three of them!

1595
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:32,000
What the heck am I supposed to do here?

1596
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:35,920
Oh, even you!

1597
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:36,220
Ouch!

1598
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:36,580
Ouch!

1599
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:37,100
Ouch!

1600
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,060
Ouch, I'm trying to... Oh gosh.

1601
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,440
Oh, ouch, ouch.

1602
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:42,540
I was trying to hide in there.

1603
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:43,780
In the crevice.

1604
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:46,140
Not a good place.

1605
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:47,620
Oh, not a good place.

1606
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:49,220
Not a good place.

1607
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:50,300
Ouch!

1608
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:58,680
Alan running for his life.

1609
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:03,900
Check for you.

1610
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:04,980
Shadow's crawled over the gate.

1611
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,480
I needed a light to destroy them to get through.

1612
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:13,680
Whoa.

1613
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:16,300
Use.

1614
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:18,400
Oh, just kidding.

1615
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:19,120
Exit.

1616
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:24,320
Up here?

1617
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:28,700
Oh, sheesh.

1618
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:32,640
We made it somehow.

1619
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:34,320
Alan jumped.

1620
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:43,980
I hope there'd still be working generator somewhere around
here to power up the old lights by the gate geez I wonder

1621
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:59,160
where I wonder where wonder where the next invention the the
sequel to underwear agent nightingale stared at the past

1622
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:06,920
outrider the man was sleeping off one hell of a night
nightingale felt a stab of envy at wakes oblivion but he had

1623
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:14,440
a job to do he put the gun to wake's head and almost became
a murderer his hand shook and his throat felt tight and dry

1624
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:22,360
biting his teeth he tried again to pull the trigger he lost
the nerve wake stirred Nightingale would have to settle for

1625
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:28,020
an arrest what guys crazy start

1626
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:47,280
I feel like there's gonna be something oh geez something
down here though any Anything?

1627
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:48,600
Nothing?

1628
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,180
Wow, actually nothing.

1629
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,220
Pretty quiet generator.

1630
01:53:58,780 --> 01:53:59,640
You think?

1631
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,800
I could sense the movement in the woods ahead.

1632
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:05,540
Facing the enemy without a weapon was dangerous, but I had
no choice.

1633
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:06,060
No!

1634
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,900
Trust no one in the dark.

1635
01:54:10,060 --> 01:54:10,700
Yeah, I know.

1636
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:13,140
Wait, I have no weapon for real!

1637
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,000
We're just gonna have to... and I have no battle.

1638
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:26,620
batteries or anything oh my gosh we're just gonna have to I
see a blinking light right there we're like not so far from

1639
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:44,540
the farm maybe okay we're lean mean dodging machine oh no
turning back they say you're you're done that's what they

1640
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:49,700
say anything here Surely there's like a...

1641
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:50,600
He's like, just kidding.

1642
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:53,180
I found the ultimate weapon.

1643
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,760
The strongest flashlight ever.

1644
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,300
Oh, I'm scared.

1645
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:00,200
I'm not gonna lie.

1646
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,660
I'm very nervous here.

1647
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:04,700
Omega-3 fatty acids.

1648
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,380
Omega-3 fatty acids.

1649
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:09,000
Whoop.

1650
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:09,840
Whoop.

1651
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:12,160
Oh, geez.

1652
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:14,160
Oh, oh, oh.

1653
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:15,220
No, please, please.

1654
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:16,880
I don't know if I'm gonna make it, guys.

1655
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:17,980
Oh gosh, ouch.

1656
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:19,540
Ah!

1657
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:22,060
Oh, I think I'm gonna die.

1658
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:23,380
Ah!

1659
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:25,840
Nice.

1660
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:27,720
Oh, we're dodging!

1661
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:28,640
Oh, we're not dodging.

1662
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:32,200
Oh, jeez.

1663
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:35,600
The generator's total bait.

1664
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:37,120
I think I got that.

1665
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:43,120
I think I understood that after we started getting totally
attacked.

1666
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,900
Your code name for this op is Naked Allen.

1667
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:48,520
as you will have no weapons.

1668
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:51,120
You must procure them on site.

1669
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:54,140
Guns are OSP.

1670
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:55,880
Okay.

1671
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:58,280
What the heck was that?

1672
01:55:59,200 --> 01:55:59,620
Oh.

1673
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,340
Wait, the guys are already coming?

1674
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,760
Did you see him running?

1675
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:08,640
I saw that guy running.

1676
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:13,940
Is he gonna say that every time?

1677
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:14,960
Oh, geez.

1678
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:16,500
What?

1679
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:18,120
Run,

1680
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:28,720
run, run, run, run.

1681
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,340
Ah, jeez.

1682
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,440
Oh my god.

1683
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:37,720
Ah!

1684
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:38,360
Ah!

1685
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:45,450
Into the light.

1686
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:46,570
Okay.

1687
01:56:47,410 --> 01:56:47,490
Oh.

1688
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:48,470
Oh.

1689
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:53,170
Honey, you all have stuff.

1690
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:56,350
How do you have unlimited weapons, each and every one of
you?

1691
01:56:57,610 --> 01:56:58,170
Okay.

1692
01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:01,570
The farm is all the way down there.

1693
01:57:01,930 --> 01:57:02,530
Oh, geez.

1694
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:03,710
Okay.

1695
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:05,090
Anything up here?

1696
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:06,190
No?

1697
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:10,130
Alan Cardio.

1698
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:16,650
You would think that this guy could, like, run with a little
more stamp.

1699
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:17,650
Is that the...

1700
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:19,170
That's the car in the...

1701
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:19,490
The novel?

1702
01:57:19,510 --> 01:57:19,990
The novel?

1703
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:21,550
The same general direction as I was.

1704
01:57:22,010 --> 01:57:23,170
For all I knew it was Barry.

1705
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:25,810
Caught in the consequences of leaping before looking.

1706
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:26,390
Okay.

1707
01:57:28,430 --> 01:57:29,910
Um, what was I saying?

1708
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:34,090
Yeah, you would think that him, like, running all of this
would improve his stamina a little bit.

1709
01:57:40,430 --> 01:57:41,830
But, heavy-duty.

1710
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:45,390
Yippee!

1711
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:48,650
You're...

1712
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:51,750
You're really not gonna give me a weapon?

1713
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:54,750
Who's going camping without something?

1714
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,140
Game hates us!

1715
01:58:03,260 --> 01:58:04,940
Luigi, welcome to Membusha.

1716
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:05,760
Thank you!

1717
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:12,740
This is it, the flashlight that I asked for!

1718
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:15,280
The best one in the world!

1719
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:25,840
The car was heading for the cabin up ahead.

1720
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:26,960
It wasn't far.

1721
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:30,460
If it was Barry, I would see the damage soon.

1722
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:39,950
Everything's gotta be the longest detour in history, though,
doesn't it?

1723
01:58:41,930 --> 01:58:44,730
It can't ever be a straight shot to the farm.

1724
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:04,450
I'm scared.

1725
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:07,450
I don't like running without a weapon.

1726
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:11,850
What the?

1727
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:15,930
I'm trying to deliver each page to the right time and place.

1728
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:18,850
I'm trying to show you how the story goes.

1729
01:59:22,670 --> 01:59:24,630
I had seen glimpses of the light before.

1730
01:59:25,070 --> 01:59:26,350
I had seen it in my dream.

1731
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:29,890
It was a strange space man or a diver in a bulky suit.

1732
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:39,150
He was the one who'd been placing the pages on my path Yeah,
whoa, there's so many he just litter littering

1733
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:46,100
Ouch, oh that's a oh that's a bear trap oops.

1734
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:48,800
Oh shoot wait that means guys are gonna appear

1735
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:56,580
Please just kill me let me start over please I made a
mistake.

1736
01:59:57,140 --> 01:59:57,800
Let me start over.

1737
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:01,560
I thought it was a pain I don't have a gun!

1738
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:04,840
Just let me start over, please.

1739
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:05,880
Let me start over.

1740
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:06,980
Just kill me.

1741
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:12,600
We just saw the page, so I thought...

1742
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:13,620
Okay, we're fine.

1743
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:14,540
Everything's fine.

1744
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:17,600
Sharp page, yeah.

1745
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:21,420
It will immediately trigger the guy, so I feel like it's not
even worth.

1746
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:24,180
I'm trying to show you how the story goes.

1747
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:25,580
Yes.

1748
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:36,480
of the light before i had seen it in my dream it was a
strange spaceman or a diver in a bulky suit he was the one

1749
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:38,280
who'd been placing the pages on my path

1750
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:43,490
okay let's read this real quick

1751
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:55,340
the dark presence at large gosh there's not fairly that many
pages left huh spaceman the fury i know i i totally thought

1752
02:00:55,340 --> 02:01:01,340
it to hell i totally thought it the very bricks are
confusing laid out to it in the manuscript growing stronger

1753
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:07,620
and stronger moving like a storm from one scene of
destruction to the next but it was still bound to follow the

1754
02:01:07,620 --> 02:01:14,680
story and chain to the dark place it came from when the
story reached the end it long for it would finally be free

1755
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:36,160
okay taking it easy nice and slow I'm trying to figure out
which way is the safest to go.

1756
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:40,060
Thread the needle.

1757
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:41,520
There's

1758
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:55,540
one leg right there.

1759
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,280
Okay, I'm concentrating.

1760
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:02,420
I'm concentrating so we don't get caught.

1761
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:05,020
Let's go.

1762
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,960
Over this.

1763
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:11,500
Ayya!

1764
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,240
Oh my god!

1765
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,120
It's just a minefield.

1766
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:22,650
Okay.

1767
02:02:23,690 --> 02:02:24,330
Threading the needle.

1768
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:26,490
Threading the needle.

1769
02:02:27,250 --> 02:02:29,310
Threading the needle.

1770
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:31,430
Threading the needle.

1771
02:02:32,050 --> 02:02:33,890
Would a flamethrower be overpowered as hell?

1772
02:02:33,970 --> 02:02:34,630
Gets taken.

1773
02:02:35,030 --> 02:02:36,670
Combination of light and physical damage.

1774
02:02:37,170 --> 02:02:38,770
I stinking wish.

1775
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:41,010
That would be like a...

1776
02:02:41,010 --> 02:02:41,510
Oh my gosh.

1777
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:43,550
That would be a great...

1778
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:44,270
Oh my god, please.

1779
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:46,370
Checkpoint!

1780
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:53,370
Oh, that would be a great, like, new game plus.

1781
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:55,670
Oh, no.

1782
02:02:56,630 --> 02:02:57,810
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1783
02:02:58,130 --> 02:02:58,550
Hold on.

1784
02:02:59,530 --> 02:02:59,610
Oh.

1785
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:05,810
Okay.

1786
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:12,170
Someone had left a gun behind.

1787
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:15,050
Now I had a fighting chance of reaching the farm.

1788
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:20,260
As I saw a thermos.

1789
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:21,700
I need that guy.

1790
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:30,020
Oh, the patients escaped the lodge.

1791
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:35,520
The storm raged on as the Anderson brothers walked
unsteadily away from the clinic with the other patients in

1792
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:35,760
tow.

1793
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:37,980
Knowing that this time they wouldn't return.

1794
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:42,760
The darkness around them sieved with horrors, but Tor and
Odin were unafraid.

1795
02:03:42,820 --> 02:03:43,680
I love Tor and Odin.

1796
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:44,900
Their eyes glinted with guile.

1797
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:48,380
They knew every secret path, and there was blood on their
hands.

1798
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:50,500
They had fought these shades before.

1799
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:53,200
Blood on their hands.

1800
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:56,040
Imagine having a lightsaber.

1801
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:58,460
Oh my god, you're right!

1802
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:01,100
That would be so good!

1803
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:02,900
Okay, we hit the checkpoint.

1804
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:04,960
There's stuff inside.

1805
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:10,100
Oh, the Taken are filled with the darkness.

1806
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:14,680
Every time they say darkness, I think of, like, Kingdom
Hearts.

1807
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:16,340
Darkness.

1808
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:26,150
Is this Dorma's worth it?

1809
02:04:27,390 --> 02:04:28,590
I sure hope so.

1810
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:43,100
Come here.

1811
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:49,020
He put a bear trap down!

1812
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:51,080
Excuse me!

1813
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:54,120
He put a bear trap down!

1814
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:58,080
This son of a bitch!

1815
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:02,720
I will say that!

1816
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,280
I will call him that!

1817
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,280
This guy!

1818
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,340
I don't... Okay, that's a wall, yeah.

1819
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:10,240
I can't, I...

1820
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:11,980
I'm angry.

1821
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:23,420
Language, sorry.

1822
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:26,920
Checkpoint.

1823
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:34,340
Bear trap.

1824
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:37,120
Bear traps!

1825
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:43,610
No.

1826
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:45,490
Seriously, there's a guy coming?

1827
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:47,410
AHHHHH!

1828
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:51,430
Ouch!

1829
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:53,650
Where are you?

1830
02:05:53,790 --> 02:05:54,250
Where is it?

1831
02:05:55,210 --> 02:05:55,550
Ow!

1832
02:05:55,730 --> 02:05:55,990
Jeez!

1833
02:05:56,410 --> 02:05:57,110
Oh my god, please!

1834
02:05:57,470 --> 02:05:57,710
No!

1835
02:05:58,930 --> 02:06:00,510
This is so rude!

1836
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:03,890
Oh geez!

1837
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:04,470
Yeah.

1838
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:05,470
That's right.

1839
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:12,340
Oh shoot.

1840
02:06:12,700 --> 02:06:13,460
How could I miss?

1841
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:17,580
Ah!

1842
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:18,800
Ah!

1843
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:19,220
Ah!

1844
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:20,040
So mean!

1845
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,160
So mean!

1846
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:21,960
So mean!

1847
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:21,980
Ah!

1848
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:23,320
So mean!

1849
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:23,560
I guess I could have missed!

1850
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:37,260
could have flared them but geez I'll do it next time more I
think I just need to go go for it

1851
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:49,640
am I going the right way

1852
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:56,990
I think so

1853
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:06,770
oh my god I tried dodging that one not very well though
Obviously.

1854
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:10,490
Yeah.

1855
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:14,960
Hoi!

1856
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:17,020
Yeah.

1857
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:17,600
Oh shoot!

1858
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:18,200
Oh shoot!

1859
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:21,060
I'm trying to re-o-o-o- there we go.

1860
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:23,200
Okay.

1861
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:28,780
We made it through though.

1862
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:33,160
To the, to the, to the, to the cabin.

1863
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:34,600
We did it.

1864
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:35,400
Oh shoot.

1865
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:37,560
Oh my god!

1866
02:07:40,180 --> 02:07:40,960
Run, run, run, run.

1867
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,960
Yeah, get out of here.

1868
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:44,900
Oh, geez.

1869
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:47,940
Holy cow.

1870
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,480
That was such bait.

1871
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:50,340
Oh, my gosh.

1872
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,340
The cabin was right here.

1873
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:55,780
And they were like, yeah, but what if we got you one more
time?

1874
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:03,910
I could see the car, but there was no sight of the driver.

1875
02:08:04,950 --> 02:08:06,510
There's something on the table, though.

1876
02:08:09,210 --> 02:08:09,550
Hello?

1877
02:08:10,570 --> 02:08:12,610
Wait, what are you having me focus on?

1878
02:08:12,990 --> 02:08:14,030
Oh, okay.

1879
02:08:17,490 --> 02:08:17,790
Hello?

1880
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:19,730
Anybody here?

1881
02:08:22,490 --> 02:08:22,730
Very?

1882
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:25,230
No!

1883
02:08:31,940 --> 02:08:32,420
What are you?

1884
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:32,860
What are you?

1885
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:34,080
No!

1886
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:34,680
Don't!

1887
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:35,680
I'm sorry!

1888
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:39,100
Hello?

1889
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:40,160
Anyone here?

1890
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:44,220
Hello?

1891
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:45,320
Anyone here?

1892
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:47,920
Yes!

1893
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:52,340
You think he's okay?

1894
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:56,020
Oh, I thought those were pancakes for a second.

1895
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,960
I was about to be like, hot dog!

1896
02:08:58,480 --> 02:08:59,300
I mean, pancake!

1897
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:01,720
It'd be so awesome.

1898
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:08,790
Push?

1899
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:20,430
Oh my gosh, it's so hard to see with the, like, extreme
minimal view of the...

1900
02:09:22,850 --> 02:09:23,370
Flashlight?

1901
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:27,340
Oh!

1902
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:28,260
Oh!

1903
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:42,780

1905
02:09:55,260 --> 02:10:05,000
buddy Like a real bad follow-up to a real good movie.

1906
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:10,680
Where the best friends suddenly the bad guy.

1907
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:11,160
No.

1908
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:16,480
Who wrote this crap anyway.

1909
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:19,260
Pulls at my collar nervously.

1910
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:21,380
Oh,

1911
02:10:27,740 --> 02:10:30,380
his final words were criticizing my work.

1912
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:33,500
Maybe.

1913
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:35,520
Maybe he deserved.

1914
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:38,120
I've run through every possible course in my head.

1915
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:43,200
If I continue like the dark presence wants me to, the story
I'm writing won't save Alice.

1916
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:45,880
It's a horror story, and it's going to kill her.

1917
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:47,140
She died from bad riding?

1918
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:49,420
No one will survive.

1919
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:51,360
Darkness will consume everything.

1920
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,860
This is what it's wanted all along.

1921
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:55,700
It will be free, unstoppable.

1922
02:10:56,260 --> 02:10:59,860
It used Alice to get to me, dangled her in front of me to
keep me going.

1923
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:01,480
It was never going to release her.

1924
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:02,920
I'm going to change this.

1925
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:03,820
I'll escape.

1926
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:06,640
Alan escape.

1927
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:08,280
Alan escape!

1928
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:09,260
I'm now the protagonist.

1929
02:11:09,820 --> 02:11:13,200
This feels like a terrible risk, but it's the only way to
save Alice.

1930
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:15,220
I'm just self-inserted.

1931
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,860
Just as much as anyone else who's been woven into it.

1932
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:19,780
The story must stay true for this to work.

1933
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:21,660
There have to be victims along the way.

1934
02:11:22,020 --> 02:11:23,460
Near escapes, cliffhangers.

1935
02:11:24,020 --> 02:11:27,420
In a horror story, it can't be certain that the hero will
succeed or even survive.

1936
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:28,020
That's so true.

1937
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:29,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1938
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:31,460
I'll write my own escape into the story next.

1939
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:32,540
I need help.

1940
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:36,680
who will help me i'll make it happen

1941
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:52,840
whoa way that's so awesome we're like a mary sue there
anything in here no okay oh my gosh i can't see in the

1942
02:11:52,840 --> 02:12:02,900
stinking house at all it's bad bad kato thank you this guy
was clearly crazy not being able to recognize good

1943
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:05,740
storytelling if it hit him in the face, which it did
repeatedly.

1944
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:16,680
Woo!

1945
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:18,660
Oh, shit.

1946
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:21,940
Oh, my God.

1947
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:32,900
I just...

1948
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:33,520
Oh, Danny, huh?

1949
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:34,520
Oh, Danny.

1950
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:38,780
I just started blasting so I could get him out of my face.

1951
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:41,020
Okay.

1952
02:12:41,240 --> 02:12:44,660
I didn't realize I hadn't checked that door earlier, so...

1953
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:48,500
Wait, can I take the car?

1954
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:51,640
The farm was still a good distance away.

1955
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:54,080
Yes, I'd need a car to get there fast.

1956
02:12:54,180 --> 02:12:54,920
Yes, sir.

1957
02:12:59,200 --> 02:12:59,520
Ew!

1958
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:01,580
Sorry, that scared me.

1959
02:13:12,190 --> 02:13:14,030
I don't like that at all.

1960
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:20,040
I thought it would attack me.

1961
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:21,400
I thought it would be like...

1962
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:24,000
I start shaking or something, you know?

1963
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:25,540
Okay.

1964
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:28,680
Um...

1965
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:32,140
They don't really want to look around, but...

1966
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:33,460
Oh, look!

1967
02:13:33,560 --> 02:13:36,280
They even tell you that there's a secret in case you missed
it.

1968
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:37,260
That's funny.

1969
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:39,340
I know there's a thermos.

1970
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:42,220
Nope, there's a piece of paper.

1971
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:47,400
My intuition was wrong.

1972
02:13:53,260 --> 02:13:54,000
Look at this!

1973
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:55,520
We're almost...

1974
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,480
We've almost got all of them already.

1975
02:13:58,100 --> 02:14:00,720
For a moment, Hartman considered strangling the idiot.

1976
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:10,420
related an emotional infant who lived for his approval wake
by contrast was a far more difficult subject not giving him

1977
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:17,040
too much leash in two days who knew what could happen
hartman would have to find a way to rein him in and quickly

1978
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:29,480
nemi thank you for the read the rocks hello daplings hello
hello welcome in we're on chapter four of alan wake so it's

1979
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:30,760
kind of a little nutty but

1980
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:36,820
We're back, thank you, Dargo, thank you!

1981
02:14:38,940 --> 02:14:39,900
Paperbacks, thank you!

1982
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:42,160
Did you get out of the woods?

1983
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:43,460
We're working on it.

1984
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:46,120
We're about to go to a barn.

1985
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:47,100
Yeah!

1986
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:48,760
Winsey, thank you!

1987
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,020
Spike, thank you!

1988
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:51,900
The first one?

1989
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:53,420
Yeah, we're playing the first Alan Wake.

1990
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,020
This is my first time playing it too, so.

1991
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:56,460
Lunar, thank you!

1992
02:14:57,200 --> 02:14:57,640
Konvaku!

1993
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:00,280
Nimi was...

1994
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:02,640
It wasn't...

1995
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:03,360
It was...

1996
02:15:03,940 --> 02:15:04,800
What was it?

1997
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,240
It was not Elden Ring, was it?

1998
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:08,040
Yee-ha!

1999
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:10,860
Hi, Nimi.

2000
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:12,220
This game is crazy.

2001
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:14,640
Kristen Glitchface, thanks for the five gifted.

2002
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:16,920
Dark Souls, Dark Souls.

2003
02:15:17,660 --> 02:15:18,840
Dark Souls, Dark Souls.

2004
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:20,380
Kristoff, thank you.

2005
02:15:21,140 --> 02:15:22,400
Krish Leo, thank you.

2006
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:25,380
Thank you guys all so much for the...

2007
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:27,120
For the gifted!

2008
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:27,700
Thank you!

2009
02:15:28,060 --> 02:15:28,800
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

2010
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:31,740
Yeah, we're in the truth.

2011
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:33,360
We're getting the manuscript page.

2012
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:39,160
and we're figuring out what's going on and I'm gonna get my
wife back, I hope.

2013
02:15:39,620 --> 02:15:43,360
But for now, I'm gonna cause vehicular manslaughter.

2014
02:15:43,420 --> 02:15:45,300
It's probably in trouble down at the farm.

2015
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:46,340
Phil, thank you.

2016
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:48,100
I felt bad for doubting him.

2017
02:15:48,580 --> 02:15:50,700
After all, I made it this far myself.

2018
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:52,700
But Barry was Barry.

2019
02:15:53,140 --> 02:15:54,220
Barry was Barry.

2020
02:15:59,290 --> 02:16:00,870
You can't do this to me.

2021
02:16:02,610 --> 02:16:05,930
In the arms of the angels.

2022
02:16:06,370 --> 02:16:07,650
Oh, my thermos!

2023
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:08,950
I'm too scared to get it, though.

2024
02:16:09,030 --> 02:16:09,970
I think I'll get ambushed.

2025
02:16:12,530 --> 02:16:14,090
There's no straight roads here.

2026
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:16,670
No roads that lead directly to where you're trying to get
to.

2027
02:16:18,130 --> 02:16:20,470
Everything is craziness.

2028
02:16:21,690 --> 02:16:23,150
Wait, there's a house here, too!

2029
02:16:23,950 --> 02:16:26,390
Wait, I'm so scared to investigate, though.

2030
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:31,910
Risk it for the biscuit?

2031
02:16:34,390 --> 02:16:36,150
I think I should try going in.

2032
02:16:38,990 --> 02:16:43,530
can i even go in i know i could steal that car if i wanted
instead

2033
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:54,230

scared but i'll do it for you guys

2035
02:17:07,070 --> 02:17:08,210
ambushed on the way out.

2036
02:17:09,630 --> 02:17:12,330
I am so getting ambushed on the way out.

2037
02:17:13,210 --> 02:17:13,650
Oh, geez.

2038
02:17:14,550 --> 02:17:14,730
Okay.

2039
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:16,570
Was there?

2040
02:17:16,930 --> 02:17:17,710
Oh, there's the box.

2041
02:17:19,310 --> 02:17:20,650
Guys, she fell for it.

2042
02:17:21,710 --> 02:17:22,910
She's so stupid.

2043
02:17:23,330 --> 02:17:24,290
Stupid VTuber.

2044
02:17:25,730 --> 02:17:26,770
She fell for the bait.

2045
02:17:27,050 --> 02:17:29,890
Look, there's going to be a guy up here that's waiting to
attack me.

2046
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:34,530
Okay.

2047
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:36,070
There's nothing up here.

2048
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:36,550
Okay.

2049
02:17:37,230 --> 02:17:38,010
Not even a bed.

2050
02:17:43,610 --> 02:17:47,370
I do have my flare gun and four bullets.

2051
02:17:49,390 --> 02:17:50,450
Wait, how do I...

2052
02:17:50,450 --> 02:17:51,130
Where's the door?

2053
02:17:51,450 --> 02:17:52,010
Oh, this is it.

2054
02:18:01,690 --> 02:18:02,170
Get in.

2055
02:18:02,370 --> 02:18:02,650
Get in.

2056
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:14,550
I won't leave you behind, baby girl!

2057
02:18:18,250 --> 02:18:18,490
Oops.

2058
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:20,310
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2059
02:18:20,550 --> 02:18:20,930
Sensitive.

2060
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:21,970
She's sensitive.

2061
02:18:27,540 --> 02:18:28,160
Okay, hold on.

2062
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:30,920
I'm gonna be ready for...

2063
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:31,280
Wait.

2064
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:34,780
Wait, this way?

2065
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:37,380
I hate the way it turns me around.

2066
02:18:46,190 --> 02:18:46,530
Oops!

2067
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:48,530
Oh, Alan Waste Materials.

2068
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:54,710
Alan Waste!

2069
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:02,180
Oops, we're fine.

2070
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:08,720
She, this car is, like, really...

2071
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:10,160
Oh my god, just speedy.

2072
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:10,780
Oh my god.

2073
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:13,100
I feel like a crazy person driving it.

2074
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:16,440
The truck was so much easier to manage.

2075
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:21,180
Oh my god.

2076
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:23,060
We're never gonna make it.

2077
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:24,820
We're not gonna make it.

2078
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,240
We're not gonna make it.

2079
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:30,860
We could take another car.

2080
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:33,720
That one's driving in style now, isn't it?

2081
02:19:34,420 --> 02:19:38,600
I was speaking of Dinosaur the Ride because I said, We're
not gonna make it.

2082
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:39,600
We're not gonna make it.

2083
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:45,060
They released Final Dinosaur the Ride merchandise.

2084
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:48,520
Which way do I go?

2085
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:50,240
I guess I follow the road.

2086
02:19:50,480 --> 02:19:51,400
But, like, what's this way?

2087
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:55,960
My curiosity has peaked.

2088
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:59,260
I might regret this.

2089
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:01,700
We're off-roading.

2090
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:04,460
Having fun waking Alan up?

2091
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:05,140
Absolutely.

2092
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:12,280
Oh.

2093
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:13,560
Oh.

2094
02:20:17,260 --> 02:20:18,260
It's a circle.

2095
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:35,410
I knew that.

2096
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:37,490
Well, now I know that.

2097
02:20:38,790 --> 02:20:40,570
For the future.

2098
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:44,470
When I...

2099
02:20:46,970 --> 02:20:47,570
Inevitably...

2100
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:52,360
Oh, God.

2101
02:20:52,480 --> 02:20:53,120
There's guys coming.

2102
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:53,840
I see them.

2103
02:20:56,500 --> 02:20:57,100
Wait.

2104
02:20:57,380 --> 02:20:58,640
Oh, which way do I go?

2105
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:01,120
Mansodder!

2106
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:01,500
Ah!

2107
02:21:13,710 --> 02:21:14,310
Mansodder!

2108
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:18,490
Backing up.

2109
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:23,560
Are they just standing there?

2110
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:23,960
Oh, no.

2111
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:33,120
Take care of these guys, one bow.

2112
02:21:42,210 --> 02:21:42,810
Oh,

2113
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:50,460
you're still alive.

2114
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:55,060
Nice.

2115
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:57,360
You can focus with the car headlights?

2116
02:21:57,860 --> 02:21:58,340
Wait, you can?

2117
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:00,280
How?

2118
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:13,460
Anyway, I guess I'll drive through the cornfield.

2119
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:15,980
Hold A.

2120
02:22:17,140 --> 02:22:17,260
Oh.

2121
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,040
Wait, oh, I think I need to get out of the car.

2122
02:22:22,420 --> 02:22:23,080
Oh, I think about it.

2123
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:23,480
Oh, okay.

2124
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:27,440
No, I felt so safe.

2125
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:29,840
Oh, man.

2126
02:22:30,100 --> 02:22:31,480
Yeah, I think we gotta get out of the car.

2127
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:32,420
Wait, do I?

2128
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:34,120
I think so.

2129
02:22:42,040 --> 02:22:44,500
No, I didn't want to leave the safety of my vehicle!

2130
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,740
I feel so powerful in it!

2131
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:48,140
Oh,

2132
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:53,400
come on!

2133
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:54,320
Ah!

2134
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:56,840
Shoot!

2135
02:22:57,320 --> 02:22:59,280
Oh no, that's not what I wanted to do!

2136
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:23,880
Uh-oh.

2137
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:24,920
Visual glitch?

2138
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:28,900
I thought we were about to get into a cutscene.

2139
02:23:33,220 --> 02:23:33,960
How much?

2140
02:23:34,060 --> 02:23:34,880
Oh, another one?

2141
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:35,900
Okay, hold on.

2142
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:38,860
How much further is the farm?

2143
02:23:42,140 --> 02:23:43,680
That bug is so annoying.

2144
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:44,640
It's so frequent.

2145
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:45,620
I know, right?

2146
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:48,320
At least we know that we can fix it pretty easily.

2147
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:50,220
Hold on, I'm letting my...

2148
02:23:50,220 --> 02:23:50,960
Okay, there we go.

2149
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:54,520
We can fix it just by, like, pausing and...

2150
02:23:56,440 --> 02:23:56,860
You know.

2151
02:23:58,180 --> 02:23:58,580
Uh...

2152
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:01,580
The farm is... that?

2153
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:07,060
Checkpoint, but at what cost?

2154
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:11,480
Thermos.

2155
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:13,560
Are these...

2156
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:14,900
Fireworks?

2157
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:18,500
Is this for the festival that they were gonna have?

2158
02:24:20,620 --> 02:24:26,700
I'd known the brothers used to be some kind of rock stars,
but it hadn't really sunk in until I saw this stage.

2159
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:27,420
Oh.

2160
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:29,960
Oh, okay.

2161
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:32,140
Ow!

2162
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:33,220
Run!

2163
02:24:33,900 --> 02:24:34,460
Incoming!

2164
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:34,540
Oh!

2165
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:36,180
There's too many of us!

2166
02:24:36,460 --> 02:24:37,380
Barry, no!

2167
02:24:43,990 --> 02:24:45,190
God damn!

2168
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:47,350
Yeah!

2169
02:24:51,910 --> 02:24:53,050
Defend this stage?

2170
02:24:57,920 --> 02:24:59,480
Oh my god.

2171
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:00,460
Okay, wait.

2172
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:02,260
I can do this.

2173
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:04,720
Oh.

2174
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:09,020
Oh, please, please shoot the gun.

2175
02:25:17,790 --> 02:25:18,270
Please!

2176
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:28,680
This is insanity!

2177
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:30,620
I'm gonna die!

2178
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:31,260
Oh god!

2179
02:25:31,560 --> 02:25:32,900
Oh my god!

2180
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:34,560
Holy cow!

2181
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,920

2182
02:25:41,060 --> 02:25:41,380

2183
02:25:41,580 --> 02:25:43,280
Reload the gun, please reload the gun!

We have to fight them all!

2185
02:25:45,980 --> 02:25:46,820
We can just throw them

2186
02:25:51,260 --> 02:25:51,460
out!

2187
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,860
Did you notice there's a lot of ammo and stuff around?

2188
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:55,580
This place is stopped!

2189
02:25:56,240 --> 02:25:56,620
Ow!

2190
02:25:56,840 --> 02:25:57,360

Oh, okay.

Oh, my God.

Oh, this light.

2208
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:18,160
This light.

02:27:20,180 --> 02:27:21,280
Oh, my God.

2210
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:21,880

my god.

2222
02:27:53,140 --> 02:27:55,240
This is pretty much how I always wanted to go out.

2223
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:56,580
Oh my god.

2224
02:27:56,580 --> 02:27:57,320
Rock and roll!

2226

Wait, oh, that's why.

Oh my god.

2230
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:09,220
That's the high point of my life.

2231
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:09,900
Really?

2232
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:17,160
Oh my god.

2233
02:28:21,940 --> 02:28:25,480
I'm going insane right now.

2234
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:32,860
Back up the flashbang.

2235
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:37,160
Mary.

2236
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:41,840

Oh my god.

2247
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:20,680
Everything's okay!

Oh my gosh.

2254
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:30,900
Let's take all this stuff.

2255
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:32,820
Now that we can reload everything.

2256
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:45,520
Do we want to like Not have the power on anymore though Like

2265
02:30:09,860 --> 02:30:11,460
What's that over there?

2266
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:16,460
Lineascript.

2267
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:20,000
They're getting trickier and trickier, huh?

2268
02:30:30,430 --> 02:30:34,210
The darkness would not be able to survive one second at an
idle concert.

2269
02:30:34,430 --> 02:30:35,070
You're so right.

2270
02:30:36,050 --> 02:30:37,990
Mulligan questions Nightingale's orders.

2271
02:30:38,290 --> 02:30:40,090
Deputy Mulligan tuned Thornton's chatter out.

2272
02:30:40,450 --> 02:30:46,630
He didn't think writers were particularly useful people and
a huge manhunt for one stuck him as idiotic certainly not

2273
02:30:46,630 --> 02:30:52,470
worth the flares are basically UOs now I have a ton of them
too it wasn't even clear what the man had done except run

2274
02:30:52,470 --> 02:30:58,670
from them at the trailer park yeah Mulligan knew we wasn't
alone the sheriff's patience with the fed was running out

2275
02:31:00,970 --> 02:31:03,370
actually though well I lose them all in the next episode

2276
02:31:07,390 --> 02:31:18,210
checkpoint checkpoint Alan's see those looks like I know
that's his shirt underneath I'm pretty sure but it looks

2277
02:31:18,210 --> 02:31:26,630
like Barry's pants are falling down Barry get about see
dress seller no reason to worry your cutouts good as new

2278
02:31:26,630 --> 02:31:33,330
right where I left it I'll come back for it once we have the
place secured maybe that's been my biggest worry all this

2279
02:31:35,230 --> 02:31:43,750
time what about Anderson house need to get this thing moved
out of the way this is as far as I got for the ambush I see.

2280
02:31:44,210 --> 02:31:46,510
There's that glow-y thing up there.

2281
02:31:48,510 --> 02:31:49,090
How do I...

2282
02:31:49,090 --> 02:31:50,810
Okay, we gotta get around, I suppose.

2283
02:31:54,750 --> 02:31:55,430
Oh, here we go.

2284
02:31:58,350 --> 02:31:59,730
Seems like a bit of a fire hazard.

2285
02:32:01,090 --> 02:32:01,310
No?

2286
02:32:03,070 --> 02:32:04,470
Oh, oh, yes, that's right!

2287
02:32:05,930 --> 02:32:07,130
Amphetamine, thank you!

2288
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:09,570
You could kind of set up for...

2289
02:32:09,570 --> 02:32:11,710
Wait, you could do that kind of set up for a concert.

2290
02:32:12,070 --> 02:32:15,470
Y'all up there singing and dancing and we got shop and we
get shopped by you.

2291
02:32:15,590 --> 02:32:16,650
Live rounds and everything.

2292
02:32:16,810 --> 02:32:17,370
It'll be lit.

2293
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:18,770
Yeah.

2294
02:32:19,270 --> 02:32:19,570
Yeah.

2295
02:32:21,150 --> 02:32:22,110
Also, Sayhi!

2296
02:32:23,810 --> 02:32:24,770
Thank you.

2297
02:32:25,270 --> 02:32:31,710
Last week was my birthday, May I spend this year and next
year and every year with the most beautiful ghost around.

2298
02:32:32,470 --> 02:32:34,290
Happy birthday, Sayhi.

2299
02:32:34,630 --> 02:32:35,510
Oh my gosh.

2300
02:32:35,570 --> 02:32:36,930
I haven't seen you in forever.

2301
02:32:39,650 --> 02:32:40,610
Happy birthday.

2302
02:32:42,810 --> 02:32:44,170
Happy birthday!

2303
02:32:46,810 --> 02:32:47,490
Yay!

2304
02:32:52,330 --> 02:32:54,770
Forever and ever and ever.

2305
02:32:54,930 --> 02:32:56,750
I'm Alan Wake here has something to say.

2306
02:32:57,170 --> 02:32:58,030
What's that, Al?

2307
02:32:58,510 --> 02:33:00,510
Ooh, I'm Alan Wake.

2308
02:33:00,830 --> 02:33:02,390
I'm always right about everything.

2309
02:33:03,070 --> 02:33:06,710
And if I don't get my way, I'll sulk all day long.

2310
02:33:06,970 --> 02:33:08,890
I'm always intense and moody.

2311
02:33:09,350 --> 02:33:11,850
It makes me very attractive and mysterious.

2312
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:18,670
Right now, I'm just standing here because I need my best
friend Barry to carry me.

2313
02:33:18,930 --> 02:33:19,670
But that's okay.

2314
02:33:19,970 --> 02:33:21,810
I can just take him for granted.

2315
02:33:22,810 --> 02:33:24,130
I think I see what you did there.

2316
02:33:24,690 --> 02:33:26,330
Yeah, it was pretty good.

2317
02:33:26,710 --> 02:33:28,550
You want me to do my imitation of Barry Wheeler?

2318
02:33:29,050 --> 02:33:29,230
No?

2319
02:33:29,810 --> 02:33:30,410
Thought so.

2320
02:33:31,010 --> 02:33:31,530
Dang!

2321
02:33:31,930 --> 02:33:32,790
I love Barry.

2322
02:33:36,010 --> 02:33:36,510
Yay!

2323
02:33:37,010 --> 02:33:37,830
Okay, that was easy.

2324
02:33:40,770 --> 02:33:41,290
Oops.

2325
02:33:43,990 --> 02:33:54,890
all right we going in ladies first you're kind of proving
Barry's point wait a second though i'm kind of i wonder if

2326
02:33:54,890 --> 02:34:02,130
there's any pages around here like there's that house all
the way over there i really love that i didn't notice the

2327
02:34:02,130 --> 02:34:07,470
flashlight during that whole thing you know what i'm just
that good i didn't need the better flashlight i'm just that

2328
02:34:07,470 --> 02:34:08,730
good at screaming and

2329
02:34:12,910 --> 02:34:16,790
Oh, I don't think we can go to that house.

2330
02:34:16,990 --> 02:34:17,470
Okay, never mind.

2331
02:34:21,170 --> 02:34:21,950
Ignore the shotgun.

2332
02:34:22,150 --> 02:34:23,890
Yeah, I'm just that good.

2333
02:34:24,130 --> 02:34:25,810
Wait, I hear whispers.

2334
02:34:30,700 --> 02:34:31,400
I thought I did.

2335
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:39,220
Spooky lights flashing.

2336
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:40,420
I guess not.

2337
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:41,400
Okay, anyway.

2338
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:44,620
No, I didn't need it.

2339
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:49,400
So I don't want your comments being like, man, watching that
without a grudge.

2340
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:55,020
grabbing the better flashlight and then out of getting the
better shotgun was painful i don't want to hear it i was

Somewhere between memories.

That's by someone else.

02:35:54,820 --> 02:36:03,720
Jones he explores the endless dreamscape only to be brought
to a sudden stop by a decidedly mundane situation a long

2357
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:10,680
line of people no way hey Jones right listen we're gonna

You're a dream.

2365
02:36:34,540 --> 02:36:36,240
The weirdo in the diving suit is a dream.

2366
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:39,480
And the girl made of smiles and sunshine is definitely a
dream.

2367
02:36:39,540 --> 02:36:40,020
She's a dream.

2368
02:36:40,040 --> 02:36:41,640
I'm pretty sure I'm dreaming this.

2369
02:36:41,860 --> 02:36:43,460
Well, maybe you're a really confused dream.

2370
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:44,380

Right there.

2375
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:51,680
I don't know what that means.

2376
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:53,740
This is like the strangest lucid dream ever.

2377
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:54,740
No sudden falls.

2378
02:36:54,820 --> 02:37:00,820

public no chases where the monster is nipping at his heels

2379
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:06,540
and he runs like crazy but his legs don't seem to get him
anywhere none of that yeah because if he wakes up in a cold

Viking.

02:39:15,290 --> 02:39:16,790
Oh, it's the flashbang!

02:39:23,560 --> 02:39:24,800
Dang, those would have been great!

2403
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:25,640
Oh, that's what...

2404
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:32,340
Okay, when I kept picking up flashbangs during that last
fight, I was thinking of the gun, like the ammo for the

2405
02:39:32,340 --> 02:39:33,780
flat, like the flare gun.

2406
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:35,020
Oh my god.

2407
02:39:35,580 --> 02:39:36,520
I'm so stupid.

2408
02:39:37,060 --> 02:39:37,740
Nobody goes.

02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:38,320
Thank you so much.

2410
02:39:38,620 --> 02:39:39,520

Thank you.

2412
02:39:41,940 --> 02:39:42,780

That's why I was like, wait a second.

2414
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:49,060
I thought I had more flare gun ammo than that.

2415
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:49,780
Oh no.

2416
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:51,340
I should have used the flashbangs.

2417
02:39:51,440 --> 02:39:52,180
That would have been great.

2418
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:53,940

They're the real deal.

Was there?

2444
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:19,020
I thought I saw something.

2445
02:42:19,100 --> 02:42:20,220
Oh, but that's what I saw on the ground.

2446
02:42:21,180 --> 02:42:22,480
No pages or anything else.

2447
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:22,800

02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:33,180

02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:38,520
Yep, you're welcome.

2453
02:42:38,740 --> 02:42:40,000
Oh, there are batteries here.

2454
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:42,480
Oh wait, I'm all full, that's right.

2455
02:42:57,370 --> 02:42:58,150
We're running?

2456
02:43:03,980 --> 02:43:04,420

Okay, my reflexes...

2463
02:43:30,980 --> 02:43:31,920
Suddenly on point.

2464
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:35,380
Barry, you good down here?

2465
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:37,740

2466
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:38,560
Yes, thank you.

2467
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:40,200
Where'd he go?

2468
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:41,340
He already went through?

2469
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:42,660
He didn't wait for me!

2470
02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:45,560
Oh,

2471
02:43:50,160 --> 02:43:50,900

2472
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:53,460
Wait, hold on.

2473
02:43:53,880 --> 02:43:54,400
I'm scared.

2474
02:43:57,220 --> 02:43:57,680
One second.

2475
02:43:57,980 --> 02:43:58,940
We got a freaky dude here.

2476
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:00,040
Thank you guys for the super chat.

2477
02:44:00,180 --> 02:44:01,460
Sorry, I can't read them right now.

2478
02:44:05,060 --> 02:44:05,720
We got a freaky...

2479
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:06,540
We got a freaky...

2480
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:06,760
Oh, wait.

2481
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:07,820
On my...

2482
02:44:07,820 --> 02:44:08,740
On my hands.

2483
02:44:09,360 --> 02:44:09,720
Unfortunately.

2484
02:44:12,580 --> 02:44:13,220
Oh my god.

2485
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:14,200
So close.

2486
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:15,460
Where is he?

2487
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:15,960
Where did he go?

2488
02:44:16,420 --> 02:44:17,620
There, uh...

2489
02:44:17,620 --> 02:44:18,320
There it is.

2490
02:44:22,340 --> 02:44:23,120
Come on, please!

2491
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:23,700
Headshot!

2492
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:25,000
There we go.

2493
02:44:26,580 --> 02:44:27,880
Did I hear my name?

2494
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:33,480
Anderson Bro's Old Gods of Asgard, the only characters
appeared, Remedy vs.

2495
02:44:33,560 --> 02:44:33,900
Games.

2496
02:44:34,460 --> 02:44:36,320
If not in physical form, at least in the OSC.

2497
02:44:36,380 --> 02:44:37,740
Wait, that's awesome!

2498
02:44:41,960 --> 02:44:42,480
Oh!

2499
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:44,060
Oh!

2500
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:45,440
Oh!

2501
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:45,720
Oh!

2502
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:47,860
Oh!

2503
02:44:50,020 --> 02:44:51,480
All right, nice.

2504
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:53,660
Nice, nice, nice.

2505
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:56,320
Barry, hold on.

2506
02:44:56,460 --> 02:44:57,800
I'm just searching around for a bit.

2507
02:44:58,980 --> 02:45:00,600
Never know when a page is going to appear.

2508
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:04,800
All right, watch yourself.

2509
02:45:05,940 --> 02:45:06,720
Mr. Wake.

2510
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,860
Don't touch the live wires.

2511
02:45:13,580 --> 02:45:14,800
Barry, where did you go?

2512
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:19,220
In here?

2513
02:45:19,400 --> 02:45:20,000

What are you doing in there?

2520
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:22,780
How did you get there?

2521
02:46:23,720 --> 02:46:24,200
Very...

2522
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:29,320
Oh my gosh, it just throws off my groove.

2523
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:30,800
Okay, we're good, though.

2524
02:46:30,980 --> 02:46:31,180
We're good.

2525
02:46:39,220 --> 02:46:41,340

2526
02:46:43,460 --> 02:46:44,680

02:46:44,860 --> 02:46:45,200

Wow.

2535
02:47:25,730 --> 02:47:29,090
First not bothering with the flashlight or shotgun, then
surviving the double glitch.

2536
02:47:29,890 --> 02:47:30,550
Nice job, gamer.

Okay.

2541
02:47:36,710 --> 02:47:37,230
Silo?

2542
02:47:37,310 --> 02:47:38,890
Is it silo or silo?

2543
02:47:40,610 --> 02:47:44,650

2548
02:48:36,780 --> 02:48:38,920
I got one guide for real.

2549
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,060
Was that a page I saw?

2550
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:46,800
I saw something flashing.

2551
02:48:47,740 --> 02:48:49,120
Or it was my imagination.

2552
02:48:51,900 --> 02:48:53,560
Oh no, I hear a radio.

2553
02:48:54,100 --> 02:48:54,840
Wait, there is something.

2554
02:48:55,660 --> 02:48:56,540
Oh, that's what...

2555
02:48:56,540 --> 02:48:57,820
Wait, I hear a radio though.

2556
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:04,000
Is it above me?

2557
02:49:04,860 --> 02:49:05,740
Where's it in here?

2558
02:49:10,090 --> 02:49:11,870
Is it up?

2559
02:49:13,330 --> 02:49:14,450
Where is the ladder?

2560
02:49:17,510 --> 02:49:18,090
Minto blind.

2561
02:49:18,230 --> 02:49:18,970
Oh, there it is.

2562
02:49:19,610 --> 02:49:20,590
Hold on.

2563
02:49:21,550 --> 02:49:22,070
Minto blind.

2564
02:49:23,990 --> 02:49:25,190
Minto climb.

2565
02:49:26,130 --> 02:49:27,170
Alan climb.

2566
02:49:28,370 --> 02:49:28,990
There it is.

2567
02:49:32,710 --> 02:49:33,430
Oh.

2568
02:49:33,830 --> 02:49:34,450
Oh, just a little.

2569
02:49:34,470 --> 02:49:35,670
in case you didn't get it before.

2570
02:49:36,410 --> 02:49:36,910
That's funny.

2571
02:49:39,210 --> 02:49:40,730
I guess I didn't really need it.

2572
02:49:42,730 --> 02:49:44,530
But look behind you.

2573
02:49:44,530 --> 02:49:46,830
As you regular listeners know, I tend to work through the
night.

2574
02:49:47,530 --> 02:49:48,710
I'm not the only one.

2575
02:49:49,330 --> 02:49:54,510
Deputies Mulligan and Thornton are taking a couple of
moments off their busy schedule to join me here in the

2576
02:49:54,510 --> 02:49:54,950
studio.

2577
02:49:55,670 --> 02:49:57,790
Boys, how busy are you now?

2578
02:49:58,110 --> 02:49:59,770
Deerfest is almost here, isn't it?

2579
02:50:00,110 --> 02:50:01,890
I bet that keeps you in business.

2580
02:50:02,390 --> 02:50:03,490
Pretty busy, yeah.

2581
02:50:04,470 --> 02:50:07,210
Actually, Pat, we've been real busy with other stuff.

2582
02:50:07,990 --> 02:50:10,370
Which concerns an ongoing investigation.

2583
02:50:11,070 --> 02:50:12,750
We can't talk about that, Thornton.

2584
02:50:13,250 --> 02:50:14,810
I wasn't going to say anything.

2585
02:50:15,270 --> 02:50:18,390
I was just saying we got, you know, other ions to fry.

2586
02:50:19,010 --> 02:50:21,370
And how would you compare your workload to last years?

2587
02:50:21,750 --> 02:50:26,830
Things have seemed relatively peaceful to me, but people do
tend to get a little wild this time of year.

2588
02:50:27,390 --> 02:50:28,550
Oh, it's wild, Pat.

2589
02:50:28,710 --> 02:50:29,510
It's pretty wild.

2590
02:50:29,690 --> 02:50:31,430
There's been all sorts of trouble this year.

2591
02:50:31,950 --> 02:50:34,130
Vandalism, fighting, public disturbances.

2592
02:50:34,470 --> 02:50:36,330
A lot of people gone missing too.

2593
02:50:36,930 --> 02:50:39,630
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty much the usual stuff, Pat.

2594
02:50:40,210 --> 02:50:42,390
Just, you know, a lot more of it.

2595
02:50:42,530 --> 02:50:42,770
Oh.

2596
02:50:43,210 --> 02:50:44,670
Not people going missing.

2597
02:50:44,830 --> 02:50:46,690
The Steerfest get wilder every year.

2598
02:50:46,830 --> 02:50:51,710
People seem to be more drunk, at least, or they start
earlier, and younger.

2599
02:50:51,850 --> 02:50:52,430
And younger?

2600
02:50:52,650 --> 02:50:53,370
Oh no!

2601
02:50:53,390 --> 02:50:56,070
It's definitely not just you, Pat, but definitely, Pat.

2602
02:50:56,570 --> 02:50:58,490
Hey, I'm talking here, Thornton.

2603
02:51:00,370 --> 02:51:00,870
Wow.

2604
02:51:02,290 --> 02:51:03,350
Not just me.

2605
02:51:03,990 --> 02:51:04,450
Oh, yeah.

2606
02:51:04,470 --> 02:51:11,070
yeah yeah it's wilder pat but actually most of the trouble
seems to be coming from grown men people who ought to know

2607
02:51:11,070 --> 02:51:18,470
better you know kids are doing not the grown-ups that's nice
to hear at least boys i want to thank you for stopping by

2608
02:51:18,470 --> 02:51:29,190
i'll let you get back to your patrol sure thing pat yeah
sure thing pat the fact that like that um we know it's like

2609

2628
02:53:10,700 --> 02:53:11,820

2630
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:13,040
I knew it!

2631
02:53:25,500 --> 02:53:28,040
It didn't even give me a chance to move.

2632
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:29,560
Oh geez.

2633
02:53:33,560 --> 02:53:34,000
What?

2634
02:53:34,860 --> 02:53:36,080
Why didn't that work?

2635
02:53:48,520 --> 02:53:49,780
Yeah, friendly fire.

2636
02:53:52,580 --> 02:53:55,300
I don't even know if this is... Oh my god, my game is
lagging for some reason.

2637
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:57,240
I don't even know if this is working.

2638
02:54:00,260 --> 02:54:01,980
Oh, oh my god.

2639
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:03,060
Friendly fire!

2640
02:54:06,500 --> 02:54:08,940
Do I need to get him to bust this open?

2641
02:54:15,870 --> 02:54:17,210
Defeat the harvester.

2642
02:54:17,950 --> 02:54:19,570
Oh, you always were a kidder.

2643
02:54:19,990 --> 02:54:21,350
You always were a kidder!

2644
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:33,320
Oh my gosh.

2645
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:33,800
Oh my gosh.

2646
02:54:33,940 --> 02:54:34,160
Oh my gosh.

2647
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:34,460
Oh my gosh.

2648
02:54:35,320 --> 02:54:35,760
Ouch.

2649
02:54:35,900 --> 02:54:36,060
Ouch.

2650
02:54:38,860 --> 02:54:39,700
No, please.

2651
02:54:53,250 --> 02:54:54,430
Let's go with the flares.

2652
02:54:55,610 --> 02:54:56,570
Go on with the T.

2653
02:55:01,730 --> 02:55:02,730
Assist kill.

2654
02:55:07,070 --> 02:55:07,670
Out of the way!

2655
02:55:07,830 --> 02:55:10,230
Oh, I definitely tried to dodge that.

2656
02:55:10,530 --> 02:55:12,870
And the slow-mo threw off my crew.

2657
02:55:13,990 --> 02:55:15,410
Oh my gosh, please.

2658
02:55:18,930 --> 02:55:19,550
Oh my god.

2659
02:55:21,050 --> 02:55:22,410
That was close.

2660
02:55:22,970 --> 02:55:23,830
I don't know, it was a close one.

2661
02:55:29,270 --> 02:55:30,230
Holy cow.

2662
02:55:30,410 --> 02:55:32,870
I need to figure out how to defeat this guy.

2663
02:55:33,870 --> 02:55:34,350
Run!

2664
02:55:36,890 --> 02:55:39,290
Yeah, get your own guys.

2665
02:55:41,190 --> 02:55:43,110
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.

2666
02:55:44,410 --> 02:55:48,290
I feel like I need to have him open the door, but maybe I'm
overthinking it.

2667
02:55:54,080 --> 02:55:56,000
Where do I... where do I... oh, like here.

2668
02:56:00,290 --> 02:56:01,610
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

2669
02:56:04,330 --> 02:56:05,910
No, no, no, no, I'm working.

2670
02:56:06,050 --> 02:56:06,350
I'm working.

2671
02:56:06,530 --> 02:56:07,250
Mommy is working.

2672
02:56:07,890 --> 02:56:08,050
Oh, shit.

2673
02:56:08,490 --> 02:56:09,090
Oh, shit.

2674
02:56:09,430 --> 02:56:09,790
Oh, shit.

2675
02:56:26,680 --> 02:56:27,080
Please.

2676
02:56:27,340 --> 02:56:29,320
I didn't see the third guy.

2677
02:56:36,500 --> 02:56:37,540
Get me out of the way.

2678
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:38,320
Please.

2679
02:56:39,860 --> 02:56:41,400
I don't think you can dodge him.

2680
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:45,540
Oh, my God.

2681
02:56:45,800 --> 02:56:48,380
I think I just have to take him out and not...

2682
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:49,280
Oh.

2683
02:56:50,760 --> 02:56:52,020
Just have to take out the...

2684
02:56:53,360 --> 02:57:00,940

Crazy.

2690
02:57:56,140 --> 02:57:57,530
Yes, good, good, good.

2691
02:57:59,780 --> 02:58:01,280
Oh, I tried to...

2692
02:58:03,020 --> 02:58:03,680
Like...

2693
02:58:05,720 --> 02:58:07,510
I don't know what I tried to do.

2694
02:58:10,820 --> 02:58:12,020
He's so close!

2695
02:58:12,920 --> 02:58:13,300
Yeah!

2696
02:58:22,470 --> 02:58:23,830
Right in the face.

2697
02:58:24,290 --> 02:58:25,190
Right in the kisser.

2698
02:58:25,190 --> 02:58:30,630
At least I'm far away from him.

2699
02:58:32,970 --> 02:58:34,710
65 pigs in the world.

2700
02:58:36,230 --> 02:58:37,410
Alan's fighting Metal Gear.

2701
02:58:37,650 --> 02:58:38,210
I know, right?

2702
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:44,620

2705
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:51,920
Yeah!

2706
02:58:52,220 --> 02:58:52,860
Are you...

2707
02:58:52,860 --> 02:58:54,920
Are you his friend or whatever the guy's name was?

2708
02:58:56,380 --> 02:58:56,580
Oh.

2709
02:58:57,140 --> 02:58:59,200
There are 65 pigs in the world.

2710
02:59:15,550 --> 02:59:16,010
Yippee!

2711
02:59:17,210 --> 02:59:18,650
Second round wasn't so bad!

2712
02:59:19,670 --> 02:59:20,610
Good job, team!

2713
02:59:22,670 --> 02:59:24,770
There are 65 pigs in the world.

2714
02:59:24,970 --> 02:59:26,330
Please let me climb this.

2715
02:59:32,430 --> 02:59:33,270
I don't...

2716
02:59:33,270 --> 02:59:34,570
I guess I did the go over there.

2717
02:59:35,370 --> 02:59:36,770
to bust through that door right there.

2718
02:59:40,750 --> 02:59:41,630
I hit...

2719
02:59:41,630 --> 02:59:45,990
Can I not open this?

2720
02:59:46,110 --> 02:59:47,170
I'm so confused.

2721
02:59:47,570 --> 02:59:49,590
It doesn't look...

2722
02:59:49,590 --> 02:59:52,890
It doesn't look like it's sealed or anything.

2723
03:00:01,460 --> 03:00:02,680
What is this?

2724
03:00:03,160 --> 03:00:04,320
Uh, Al?

2725
03:00:04,800 --> 03:00:05,740
Is that you out there, buddy?

2726
03:00:05,800 --> 03:00:07,200
I had to find a key to get better.

2727
03:00:07,220 --> 03:00:15,700

03:00:18,890 --> 03:00:21,270

2730
03:00:37,350 --> 03:00:38,390
working on it

2731
03:00:46,260 --> 03:00:47,060
I'm scared.

2732
03:00:47,360 --> 03:00:48,060
Am I going to get ambushed?

2733
03:00:49,280 --> 03:00:49,860
Oh, wow.

2734
03:00:50,020 --> 03:00:52,280
That was the fastest unlock ever.

2735
03:00:52,820 --> 03:00:53,660
Hey, let's go, man.

2736
03:00:54,120 --> 03:00:54,340
Okay.

2737
03:01:01,400 --> 03:01:03,280
I was being punished for exploring.

2738
03:01:03,460 --> 03:01:05,480
Omega-3 fatty acids are good for the heart.

2739
03:01:06,480 --> 03:01:06,600
Oh.

2740
03:01:07,300 --> 03:01:07,740
Sorry.

2741
03:01:09,140 --> 03:01:09,400
Sorry.

2742
03:01:11,880 --> 03:01:14,360
Hey, I think that's the form on the other side of the field.

2743
03:01:14,660 --> 03:01:15,720
We're almost there.

2744
03:01:16,220 --> 03:01:17,260
It hasn't been the farm?

2745
03:01:18,120 --> 03:01:19,600
This entire time?

2746
03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:20,920
We should feel right at home then.

2747
03:01:23,660 --> 03:01:23,980
Nuts.

2748
03:01:25,340 --> 03:01:26,980
I think I see the farm finally.

2749
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:29,800
Yeah, did it seem that heavy?

2750
03:01:30,880 --> 03:01:31,900
Come on, one more gig.

2751
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:33,020
Let's do this thing.

2752
03:01:38,930 --> 03:01:41,330
Old gods know the truth.

2753
03:01:43,910 --> 03:01:44,370
Interesting.

2754
03:01:45,910 --> 03:01:47,190
Anything else around here?

2755
03:01:52,120 --> 03:01:53,740
All right, let's just go in.

2756
03:01:55,560 --> 03:01:57,420
Get to the Anderson house.

2757
03:01:59,800 --> 03:01:59,860
Oh.

2758
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:00,480
The lights are out.

2759
03:02:00,880 --> 03:02:02,200
I guess we better check the fuse box.

2760
03:02:03,280 --> 03:02:04,760
They also don't lock their doors.

2761
03:02:08,220 --> 03:02:09,060
Not the...

2762
03:02:09,060 --> 03:02:10,340
Can I pick up the rockets?

2763
03:02:11,260 --> 03:02:11,440
Dang.

2764
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:14,400
Look, they have like a record and a gold record and
everything.

2765
03:02:14,880 --> 03:02:17,080
Oh my gosh, Barry, you scared the heck out of me.

2766
03:02:18,040 --> 03:02:19,420
Let's find the fuse box.

2767
03:02:21,240 --> 03:02:21,660
Examine?

2768
03:02:22,120 --> 03:02:40,970
downstairs was out but I was sure I could fix that at the
fuse box yes these guys were really popular oh nice what the

2769
03:02:40,970 --> 03:02:56,010
helly berry no he's not Halleberry their house is like so
normal all things considered I okay I you know what I I gave

2770
03:02:56,010 --> 03:03:04,090
the forest, I gave the woods a lot of flack, but being in
these tight spaces with the, with the strongest flashlight

2771
03:03:04,090 --> 03:03:06,750
in the world is tough.

2772
03:03:07,710 --> 03:03:12,730
Everything is either completely dark or completely like, I'm
getting flashbanged.

2773
03:03:12,770 --> 03:03:13,690
It's one or the other.

2774
03:03:13,830 --> 03:03:15,390
You know, this place looks kind of lived it.

2775
03:03:15,690 --> 03:03:17,750
I thought the Andersons were in the booby hatch.

2776
03:03:19,770 --> 03:03:22,010
All gods know the true.

2777
03:03:24,370 --> 03:03:25,590
Wait, they didn't get to finish it.

2778
03:03:29,940 --> 03:03:31,040
You coming upstairs?

2779
03:03:31,200 --> 03:03:32,940
Okay, I feel safer with you around, Barry.

2780
03:03:33,140 --> 03:03:33,780
Don't ask why.

2781
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:36,460
I just do.

2782
03:03:43,640 --> 03:03:43,740
Oh!

2783
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:45,760
Manage crepe, page.

2784
03:03:48,580 --> 03:03:49,760
Is this the last one?

2785
03:03:51,680 --> 03:03:52,620
For this chapter?

2786
03:03:53,360 --> 03:03:56,340
Oh, oh, there's still one point at the bottom.

03:03:56,720 --> 03:03:58,200
The mystery of the missing week.

2788
03:03:58,680 --> 03:03:59,300
Oh, yeah!

2789
03:03:59,560 --> 03:04:02,040
Alice's screams rang in the stillness of the night.

2790
03:04:03,300 --> 03:04:11,200

Oh, Barry, you want to come in here?

Am I still able to get this very bottom one or no?

2800
03:04:51,700 --> 03:04:53,000
Obviously, I know I can't get this one.

2801
03:04:53,100 --> 03:04:55,780
It has to be on hard mode, but...

2802
03:04:56,500 --> 03:04:57,780
Do you think there's...

2803
03:04:58,620 --> 03:04:59,560
Is it close by?

2804
03:04:59,600 --> 03:05:01,220

Oh, my God, his cutout skin.

2845

I'm a writer.

2846
03:09:05,860 --> 03:09:06,000
I'm a writer.

2847
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:09,240
If I just wanted to, I could write 10 books a year.

2848
03:09:09,320 --> 03:09:09,580
Yeah.

2849
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:12,040
And they'd be the best books that year.

2850
03:09:12,140 --> 03:09:13,820
No, you couldn't.

2851
03:09:14,060 --> 03:09:14,740
That's right.

2852
03:09:14,820 --> 03:09:15,460
I couldn't.

2853
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:17,360
But I could, because I'm a writer.

2854
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:18,740
Alan Redder.

2855
03:09:19,620 --> 03:09:21,160
What do they put in this stuff?

2856
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:24,400
I feel like my brain is coming out of my nose.

2857
03:09:25,960 --> 03:09:31,800
I'm going to get the recipe off those coots and be a booze
millionaire.

2858
03:09:32,040 --> 03:09:32,980
A booze millionaire.

2859
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:34,260
A booze millionaire.

2860
03:09:35,480 --> 03:09:37,680
I just want her here with me.

2861
03:09:37,760 --> 03:09:39,100
Oh, no, he's a crying drunk.

2862
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:39,920
I know.

2863
03:09:40,780 --> 03:09:42,080
It's going to be okay.

2864
03:09:42,660 --> 03:09:44,020
We're going to make it okay.

2865
03:09:44,360 --> 03:09:46,460
I can be here for you, baby.

2866
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:48,300
Oh my god.

2867
03:09:48,980 --> 03:09:49,660
Cut out.

2868
03:09:52,100 --> 03:09:56,720
No way, they literally passed out on the floor, drunk.

2869
03:09:59,280 --> 03:10:01,080
We have Barry now.

2870
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:06,320
I'm

2871
03:10:09,990 --> 03:10:12,010
glad I'm not the only one afraid of this thing.

2872
03:10:16,140 --> 03:10:18,700
Why does he wake up and see his cut out?

2873
03:10:20,460 --> 03:10:22,000
It's me, Alan Wake.

2874
03:10:30,080 --> 03:10:31,040
Wait, what?

2875
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:33,140
Oh, I'm back here?

2876
03:10:35,280 --> 03:10:36,180
I'm drunk.

2877
03:10:36,320 --> 03:10:38,040
Oh, I'm a out of body.

2878
03:10:38,800 --> 03:10:38,800
Alice,

2879
03:10:43,340 --> 03:10:43,700
I'm coming.

2880
03:10:44,260 --> 03:10:44,840
It's all right.

2881
03:10:45,260 --> 03:10:45,760
I'm coming.

2882
03:10:46,380 --> 03:10:48,260
It was a crazy drunken dream.

2883
03:10:48,500 --> 03:10:50,220
And yet, it was more than that.

2884
03:10:50,800 --> 03:10:51,560
It was the truth.

2885
03:10:51,980 --> 03:10:55,100
A suppressed memory unearthed by the Anderson's moonshine.

2886
03:10:55,520 --> 03:10:56,000
Where is he?

2887
03:10:56,060 --> 03:10:56,460
I was there.

2888
03:10:56,800 --> 03:10:58,220
An out-of-body observer.

2889
03:10:58,900 --> 03:10:59,840
This was the night Alice...

2890
03:10:59,860 --> 03:11:06,520
and I had arrived at Bright Falls the night Alice had
disappeared I had a chance to find out what had happened I

2891
03:11:06,520 --> 03:11:18,300
remembered being surprised to see the cabin dark Alice would
have never turned the lights off oh there I am Alice okay

2892
03:11:18,300 --> 03:11:29,740
I'm going oh my god I remembered thinking I caught a glimpse
of her form underwater sinking into the darkness this is a

2893
03:11:29,740 --> 03:11:37,180
cool way to show what happened diving after her was the last
vague memory i had of that night yeah yeah after that the

2894
03:11:37,180 --> 03:11:42,620
next thing i could remember and we were in the car the wheel
of the crash car i'm finding the first pages of the

2895
03:11:42,620 --> 03:11:54,960
manuscript this did he get her i couldn't find her in all
that blackness i must have thought she drowned

2896
03:12:04,980 --> 03:12:14,300
Oh, okay.

2897
03:12:14,760 --> 03:12:17,020
That lady just peered out of nowhere.

2898
03:12:18,600 --> 03:12:20,560
Did you see her just like...

2899
03:12:22,400 --> 03:12:25,120
Imagine Boo's so good, it unlocks your repressed memory.

2900
03:12:25,440 --> 03:12:26,980
Maybe she didn't drown after all.

2901
03:12:27,900 --> 03:12:29,280
Maybe she's inside.

2902
03:12:30,540 --> 03:12:31,040
Yes.

2903
03:12:31,420 --> 03:12:33,020
The dark presence had touched me.

2904
03:12:33,460 --> 03:12:36,160
She had dug her nails into my brain and used me.

2905
03:12:36,200 --> 03:12:37,720
I guess I could have gone down there.

2906
03:12:37,760 --> 03:12:40,120
I could have gone down there.

2907
03:12:40,420 --> 03:12:40,480
Oh.

2908
03:12:42,380 --> 03:12:43,200
She's inside.

2909
03:12:43,480 --> 03:12:43,740
Oh, boop.

2910
03:12:43,980 --> 03:12:45,680
She must be here somewhere.

2911
03:12:46,260 --> 03:12:47,860
Maybe upstairs in the study.

2912
03:12:47,980 --> 03:12:48,360
Alice.

2913
03:12:48,680 --> 03:12:50,220
Yes, that's where she is.

2914
03:12:50,880 --> 03:12:51,900
You can apologize.

2915
03:12:52,600 --> 03:12:53,040
Alice.

2916
03:12:53,320 --> 03:12:57,020
You laugh at the whole thing together and put it behind you.

2917
03:12:57,660 --> 03:12:58,320
She like...

2918
03:12:58,320 --> 03:12:58,460
Oh.

2919
03:12:59,660 --> 03:13:00,680
Alan teleport.

2920
03:13:01,440 --> 03:13:02,080
He like...

2921
03:13:02,080 --> 03:13:03,280
She's not here.

2922
03:13:03,460 --> 03:13:04,540
Gets locked in here.

2923
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:05,720
You were foolish to think so.

2924
03:13:06,040 --> 03:13:06,340
What?

2925
03:13:06,520 --> 03:13:07,740
No, she's dead.

2926
03:13:08,160 --> 03:13:08,520
She drowned.

2927
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:10,040
Oh my god!

2928
03:13:10,340 --> 03:13:11,760
No, no, no!

2929
03:13:13,280 --> 03:13:14,720
It's your fault.

2930
03:13:14,880 --> 03:13:15,520
Your wife is dead.

2931
03:13:15,520 --> 03:13:16,760
Look at the gamer posture on this list.

2932
03:13:17,080 --> 03:13:17,540
You are guilty.

2933
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:20,720
All she wanted was to help you right.

2934
03:13:21,440 --> 03:13:22,920
You killed her.

2935
03:13:24,140 --> 03:13:25,020
Oh, hush.

2936
03:13:25,280 --> 03:13:26,140
There's still hope.

2937
03:13:26,880 --> 03:13:29,180
Quadron Lake is a special place.

2938
03:13:29,920 --> 03:13:31,920
Here, you have the power to change things.

2939
03:13:31,920 --> 03:13:31,940
Oh, yeah.

2940
03:13:32,020 --> 03:13:32,920
She's upstairs.

2941
03:13:33,460 --> 03:13:34,120
Apologize.

2942
03:13:34,400 --> 03:13:35,500
No, you idiot.

2943
03:13:35,900 --> 03:13:36,540
She's dead.

2944
03:13:37,020 --> 03:13:38,500
Why would you think she's alive?

2945
03:13:45,020 --> 03:13:57,060
Yes, you can write her back the story will come true and all
will be well again She had Alice and the manuscript was the

2946
03:13:57,060 --> 03:13:58,280
ransom for her.

2947
03:13:58,280 --> 03:13:59,030
Oh my god

2948
03:14:04,440 --> 03:14:09,480
Dang this booze is good stuff Yes, I'll write.

2949
03:14:10,240 --> 03:14:10,700
Yes.

2950
03:14:11,020 --> 03:14:11,980
I'll fix it.

2951
03:14:12,800 --> 03:14:13,580
I'll bring her back.

2952
03:14:13,960 --> 03:14:14,380
Oh no.

2953
03:14:14,660 --> 03:14:15,780
I thought you were a writer.

2954
03:14:16,060 --> 03:14:18,140
Why do you type one finger at a time?

2955
03:14:18,280 --> 03:14:18,800
Eee!

2956
03:14:20,500 --> 03:14:22,160
She saw me!

2957
03:14:22,260 --> 03:14:22,420
No.

2958
03:14:23,400 --> 03:14:24,280
I wrote it.

2959
03:14:24,760 --> 03:14:26,420
I remembered it all now.

2960
03:14:27,200 --> 03:14:29,060
In the dark, I'd written for days.

2961
03:14:29,220 --> 03:14:31,820
Oh, that's where the whole thing came from!

2962
03:14:32,360 --> 03:14:32,980
Entitled departure.

2963
03:14:34,200 --> 03:14:36,000
In the time that he was gone.

2964
03:14:36,180 --> 03:14:36,480
Oh my god.

2965
03:14:37,220 --> 03:14:39,920
holding story would make her more and more powerful.

2966
03:14:40,320 --> 03:14:41,760
I thought I was saving Alice.

2967
03:14:42,960 --> 03:14:44,280
She's a writer, not a typer.

2968
03:14:44,980 --> 03:14:50,500
Even with the cobwebs she put in my head, some part of me
had been aware enough to write my escape into the story.

2969
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:51,160
Oh!

2970
03:14:51,160 --> 03:14:54,160
To bring a light into the cabin to release me before I could
finish.

2971
03:14:54,920 --> 03:15:00,200
To interrupt the horror story before the ending, where
darkness consumed everything and everyone.

2972
03:15:01,300 --> 03:15:02,520
It's where the TV bits are from.

2973
03:15:02,620 --> 03:15:02,760
Yeah!

2974
03:15:03,700 --> 03:15:08,120
But I had written him into the Set me free.

2975
03:15:08,200 --> 03:15:08,640
Oh!

2976
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:12,180
It isn't here now.

2977
03:15:12,480 --> 03:15:13,960
I'm here because it was written.

2978
03:15:14,260 --> 03:15:15,460
I brought the light to save you.

2979
03:15:15,960 --> 03:15:16,560
Bioshock?

2980
03:15:17,140 --> 03:15:18,380
Big Daddy!

2981
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:20,320
What the hell?

2982
03:15:21,920 --> 03:15:25,040
She stole the skin of my Barbara a long time ago.

2983
03:15:25,760 --> 03:15:26,860
She looks so old.

2984
03:15:27,900 --> 03:15:29,940
Oh no, that's so sad.

2985
03:15:30,760 --> 03:15:32,300
Ew, it took his wife.

2986
03:15:32,420 --> 03:15:33,880
She's a literal skinwalker.

2987
03:15:35,540 --> 03:15:36,820
Big Daddy Zane.

2988
03:15:37,220 --> 03:15:38,580
Oh, he's so cool.

2989
03:15:38,620 --> 03:15:40,800
I've woken up, confused, and groggy.

2990
03:15:41,340 --> 03:15:43,820
My mind consumed by darkness and fear.

2991
03:15:44,140 --> 03:15:45,620
All I could do was to escape.

2992
03:15:54,060 --> 03:15:54,580
Harp!

2993
03:15:57,590 --> 03:15:59,970
The weak spin in the cabin had taken its toll.

2994
03:16:00,570 --> 03:16:03,250
I was barely conscious and fading fast.

2995
03:16:04,850 --> 03:16:07,830
Maybe you shouldn't drive, then, because we all know what
happens.

2996
03:16:08,010 --> 03:16:12,910
It had to have cost Zane terribly, throwing him even deeper
into whatever dark place he now haunted.

2997
03:16:13,610 --> 03:16:15,370
And he sacrificed himself!

2998
03:16:15,390 --> 03:16:17,370
But he had managed to weaken the dark presence.

2999
03:16:17,910 --> 03:16:19,470
Kept me safe that night.

3000
03:16:19,990 --> 03:16:20,570
Oh god.

3001
03:16:20,850 --> 03:16:22,810
But who will keep you safe from yourself?

3002
03:16:22,950 --> 03:16:23,570
Alan Wake.

3003
03:16:23,970 --> 03:16:24,930
Alan Wake!

3004
03:16:25,410 --> 03:16:25,850
Wake!

3005
03:16:26,350 --> 03:16:27,170
You must wake!

3006
03:16:29,170 --> 03:16:30,630
Oh my god!

3007
03:16:35,390 --> 03:16:36,350
I wrote it.

3008
03:16:36,690 --> 03:16:37,610
It's my fault.

3009
03:16:38,570 --> 03:16:40,490
That's right, James Joyce.

3010
03:16:40,690 --> 03:16:41,550
It's your fault.

3011
03:16:41,830 --> 03:16:43,030
Oh, Nightingale.

3012
03:16:44,470 --> 03:16:45,150
Whoa!

3013
03:16:53,290 --> 03:16:53,650
Yeah!

3014
03:16:55,670 --> 03:16:57,150
He did an Alan break.

3015
03:16:58,450 --> 03:17:00,370
No, don't Alan drink and drive.

3016
03:17:08,530 --> 03:17:10,330
Turn it up a little.

3017
03:17:13,110 --> 03:17:19,910
Now the muse she was is happiness and he wamed about her
grace and told the stories of

3018
03:17:28,100 --> 03:17:29,480
That was so good!

3019
03:17:29,600 --> 03:17:30,760
Oh my gosh, the whole reveal!

3020
03:17:32,040 --> 03:17:33,060
That was so awesome!

3021
03:17:33,180 --> 03:17:38,940
The music in this...

3022
03:17:38,940 --> 03:17:39,940
Oh, into the lake she drew!

3023
03:17:42,900 --> 03:17:43,800
Good job, Minky!

3024
03:17:43,960 --> 03:17:44,740
Thank you!

3025
03:17:47,940 --> 03:17:49,560
I'm like trying to listen to the lyrics.

3026
03:17:49,820 --> 03:17:51,500
I'm like, trying to listen to the lyrics.

3027
03:17:57,530 --> 03:17:57,930
Whoa!

3028
03:17:58,270 --> 03:18:01,150
Oh, they wrote the answers.

3029
03:18:02,190 --> 03:18:03,170
Why didn't they do it then?

3030
03:18:21,500 --> 03:18:24,360
Imagine, like, they went on tour with this music, right?

3031
03:18:25,160 --> 03:18:25,420
Ash?

3032
03:18:28,920 --> 03:18:32,780
They go on tour with this, and nobody knows that they're
listening to literal...

3033
03:18:35,100 --> 03:18:40,440
Like, like, a whole ancient, like, eldritch gods.

3034
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:42,840
situation.

3035
03:18:43,060 --> 03:18:43,700
That's

3036
03:18:59,270 --> 03:19:02,730
how you reshape Destiny.

3037
03:19:03,870 --> 03:19:04,150
Whoa.

3038
03:19:04,970 --> 03:19:05,530
Well, clearly.

3039
03:19:10,170 --> 03:19:12,450
We don't do such a good job because there's a second.

3040
03:19:12,790 --> 03:19:13,350
There's a sequel.

3041
03:19:16,590 --> 03:19:17,130
Oh.

3042
03:19:28,450 --> 03:19:32,530
Now, if it's real or just a dream, one used to remain.

3043
03:19:40,670 --> 03:19:50,310
Scary Oh Oh Oh yeah

3044
03:19:59,620 --> 03:20:03,420
Teacher karaoke song is so good

3045
03:20:25,180 --> 03:20:27,600
It's how you reshape destiny.

3046
03:20:41,560 --> 03:20:43,880
Can't wait for you to hear Outlake 2 music.

3047
03:20:45,640 --> 03:20:46,200
How

3048
03:20:49,490 --> 03:20:51,930
you reshape destiny.

3049
03:20:54,830 --> 03:20:56,690
Sing this song at one of your concerts.

3050
03:20:58,830 --> 03:20:59,390
Whoa!

3051
03:21:00,310 --> 03:21:01,750
Poet in the Muse sweeps.

3052
03:21:01,850 --> 03:21:02,830
It isn't even close.

3053
03:21:03,170 --> 03:21:03,510
That was so awesome.

3054
03:21:03,510 --> 03:21:09,310
Previously on Outlake, under the influence of the Dark
Presence, I wrote a horror story that is coming true.

3055
03:21:09,530 --> 03:21:10,830
Jagger had been my editor.

3056
03:21:10,910 --> 03:21:12,670
Wait, I think I'm just gonna quit.

3057
03:21:12,830 --> 03:21:16,370
I kind of want to recap next week when we...

3058
03:21:16,370 --> 03:21:17,390
Oh, that was crazy!

3059
03:21:17,670 --> 03:21:18,790
That was so good!

3060
03:21:19,670 --> 03:21:19,990
Woo!

3061
03:21:20,390 --> 03:21:21,930
Wait, it did save, right?

3062
03:21:22,110 --> 03:21:22,550
I assume.

3063
03:21:24,450 --> 03:21:24,890
Whoa.

3064
03:21:26,070 --> 03:21:26,510
Damn.

3065
03:21:28,930 --> 03:21:29,370
Damn.

3066
03:21:30,930 --> 03:21:31,590
That was...

3067
03:21:31,590 --> 03:21:31,990
Wait, hold on.

3068
03:21:32,250 --> 03:21:33,190
I mean, it should.

3069
03:21:33,410 --> 03:21:33,650
It should.

3070
03:21:33,890 --> 03:21:34,010
Yeah.

3071
03:21:34,970 --> 03:21:35,410
Damn.

3072
03:21:35,750 --> 03:21:36,190
Woo!

3073
03:21:37,050 --> 03:21:38,330
Oh, my gosh.

3074
03:21:38,410 --> 03:21:39,230
I'm so cool.

3075
03:21:42,590 --> 03:21:44,610
That was so awesome.

3076
03:21:50,530 --> 03:21:52,190
What a good chapter.

3077
03:21:53,110 --> 03:21:58,170
It didn't feel like it was pretty long still, but it didn't
feel like it was like dragon and dragon, you know, like the

3078
03:21:58,170 --> 03:21:58,590
other ones.

3079
03:21:58,910 --> 03:22:01,330
And I kind of like it when it switches it up.

3080
03:22:01,450 --> 03:22:09,150
Like, you know, we had like the whole walking around the,
like the therapy office, and then fighting the furniture in

3081
03:22:09,150 --> 03:22:09,390
there.

3082
03:22:09,530 --> 03:22:12,790
And then we had the garden, which I thought was that part
scared me.

3083
03:22:14,230 --> 03:22:18,190
And then, and I just don't like being, like, so cramped.

3084
03:22:18,550 --> 03:22:22,810
And with the, like, you know, with the walls and the
henchmase.

3085
03:22:23,450 --> 03:22:26,010
And then, and then we, like, lost all our stuff.

3086
03:22:26,090 --> 03:22:30,330
And we had to go around with just the light or something,
you know, dodging stuff.

3087
03:22:30,410 --> 03:22:32,350
Like, it was, there was a lot going on.

3088
03:22:32,550 --> 03:22:33,050
It was fun.

3089
03:22:33,150 --> 03:22:34,830
Yeah, we had berry most of the time.

3090
03:22:34,850 --> 03:22:35,450
It was great.

3091
03:22:35,590 --> 03:22:36,750
And our little cutout.

3092
03:22:36,870 --> 03:22:37,630
I loved that.

3093
03:22:39,910 --> 03:22:41,410
That was so fun.

3094
03:22:42,610 --> 03:22:43,470
Clostrophobic battle.

3095
03:22:43,650 --> 03:22:44,530
Yeah, scary.

3096
03:22:47,250 --> 03:22:48,370
This is so awesome.

3097
03:22:48,830 --> 03:22:52,310
You take two pills in the morning, and then you'll be nice
and calm all day long.

3098
03:22:52,730 --> 03:22:54,110
You take three pills at night.

3099
03:22:55,010 --> 03:22:56,210
I don't know what he said the rest.

3100
03:22:56,650 --> 03:22:58,870
I just remember, two pills in the morning, three pills at
night.

3101
03:23:07,310 --> 03:23:07,750
Yeah.

3102
03:23:09,970 --> 03:23:11,550
I mean, do in the hedge maze.

3103
03:23:11,950 --> 03:23:12,310
scary.

3104
03:23:13,490 --> 03:23:14,610
And then you kissed Barry.

3105
03:23:22,670 --> 03:23:24,570
Omega 3 fatty acids are good for your heart.

3106
03:23:24,770 --> 03:23:27,490
And we also learned that there are 67 pigs in the world.

3107
03:23:27,910 --> 03:23:28,990
No, not... Was it 67?

3108
03:23:29,910 --> 03:23:31,490
Where am I making that number up?

3109
03:23:31,950 --> 03:23:32,770
Because of 67.

3110
03:23:33,850 --> 03:23:34,790
Oh, no.

3111
03:23:39,290 --> 03:23:39,850
65!

3112
03:23:46,870 --> 03:23:48,030
Oh, no!

3113
03:23:50,250 --> 03:23:52,130
65 pigs in the world.

3114
03:23:57,560 --> 03:23:59,300
6-7 poisoning.

3115
03:24:00,220 --> 03:24:01,120
Gosh, dang it.

3116
03:24:02,460 --> 03:24:03,560
I need scissors.

3117
03:24:04,500 --> 03:24:05,900
65 billion.

3118
03:24:08,700 --> 03:24:10,180
You are what you hate.

3119
03:24:10,840 --> 03:24:11,300
Cringe?

3120
03:24:11,920 --> 03:24:13,180
I don't hate cringe.

3121
03:24:14,020 --> 03:24:15,400
But I know I am cringe.

3122
03:24:16,920 --> 03:24:18,280
I don't hate it.

3123
03:24:19,040 --> 03:24:20,160
I don't hate cringe.

3124
03:24:20,760 --> 03:24:21,800
But I am cringe.

3125
03:24:26,220 --> 03:24:28,060
You are what you eat.

3126
03:24:31,420 --> 03:24:32,860
65 billion pigs.

3127
03:24:37,800 --> 03:24:39,040
It's so funny.

3128
03:24:39,300 --> 03:24:45,340
I think, like, more than scary, it's so funny when they
appear out of nowhere and just say, like, a really stupid

3129
03:24:45,340 --> 03:24:46,420
fact like that.

3130
03:24:48,400 --> 03:24:49,580
It's so fun.

3131
03:24:49,920 --> 03:24:51,800
But anyway, I think...

3132
03:24:51,820 --> 03:25:06,580
maybe next week we'll endurance chapter five and six so that
we can beat the game i am become cringe the freer of worlds

3133
03:25:10,040 --> 03:25:23,600
yeah yeah yeah so we can do that and um yeah aren't there
more chapters after six technically but we'll we'll save

3134
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:31,120
that for another time too minto finished the chapter fatigue
made stuff extra scary but she'd been brave and crushed all

3135
03:25:31,120 --> 03:25:37,500
obstacles with her mad gamer skills victorious she treated
herself to a super yummy meal as a reward then she slept

3136
03:25:37,500 --> 03:25:49,160
lots and had amazing cheese d'wargo is writing it and he is
willing it into reality d'wargo we didn't know but he's

3137
03:25:49,160 --> 03:25:55,180
literally at the lake right now You're at the lake right
now!

3138
03:25:58,280 --> 03:26:00,920
But, um, the DLC, it seems that we can also do both
chapters.

3139
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:01,760
It's like two chapters.

3140
03:26:01,880 --> 03:26:03,620
We could do those both in one stream as well.

3141
03:26:03,940 --> 03:26:09,820
So, really, we just have, well, then have two streams left
of Alan Wake and then, yeah.

3142
03:26:10,260 --> 03:26:11,640
Oh my gosh, this is so fun.

3143
03:26:11,740 --> 03:26:13,100
I can't wait to get to Alan Wake, too.

3144
03:26:13,280 --> 03:26:15,340
I might take a little bit of a break in between, but we'll
see.

03:26:16,120 --> 03:26:18,360
