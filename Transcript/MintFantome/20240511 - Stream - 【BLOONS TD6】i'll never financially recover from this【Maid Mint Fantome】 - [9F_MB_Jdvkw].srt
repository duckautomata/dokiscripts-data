1
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,630
Monkey time.

2
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:58,970
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey time.

3
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,370
This is the weirdest bunny girl cafe I've ever seen.

4
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,950
You guys, I'm sorry.

5
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,730
Today on my schedule was... bunny garden.

6
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,450
Woah!

7
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,090
Woah!

8
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,610
Why is Discord sending me stuff even though I have OBS open?

9
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,290
Huh?

10
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,030
Oh, I disabled streamer mode.

11
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,550
Matara!

12
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,330
She said this song appeared on my Spotify.

13
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,530
And it's from Metal Gear Rising.

14
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,470
Yeah!

15
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,880
The game is quiet.

16
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
It is quiet.

17
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,060
Because, look at this.

18
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,180
I can't stand listening to the music in this game.

19
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,820
Yeah, the game itself will be louder though.

20
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,320
I was thinking actually maybe just putting on my own music.

21
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,520
Put it at max!

22
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,730
Yeah, I might do my own BGM.

23
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,630
We'll see how, you know, we get.

24
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,170
As we... as we listen to monkey.

25
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:37,110
If you guys don't know this game, I actually just like started replaying it a couple days ago.

26
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,050
So, oh wait, this might be loud.

27
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,970
Okay, hold on.

28
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,730
I'm gonna turn it down.

29
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,210
That was loud!

30
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,430
I turned it down.

31
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,550
Insta-monkey!

32
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,490
Yippee!

33
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,130
I only started replaying a couple days ago.

34
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,910
And I was like...

35
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:57,830
I don't know.

36
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,830
I was just feeling it.

37
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,390
I don't know.

38
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,590
Nothing caused it.

39
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,410
I was just like, wow.

40
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:02,610
Love.

41
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,450
I was like looking through my games and I was like, Oh, Bloons!

42
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,670
I'm just gonna...

43
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,070
I'm just gonna play it again.

44
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,050
Monkey!

45
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,210
Picked it up on the Steam sale.

46
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,470
No, no, I already own this.

47
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,390
I already owned it.

48
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,690
Yeah, so...

49
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,550
It was...

50
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,670
Easy... or not easy.

51
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,590
It was in my library.

52
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,430
I guess easy to play.

53
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,310
Because it was just there.

54
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,210
Yeah.

55
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,650
Happy maid day to my favorite mint maid maid mint!

56
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,150
I'm lucky that my super chat is mint colored.

57
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,570
Thank you, Steel!

58
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,590
Yes, it's...

59
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,610
I thought... I was like, oh my gosh, it's maid day.

60
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,190
Should I have changed to something more maid-like?

61
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,950
But...

62
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,520
But maybe it's okay because...

63
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,400
Maybe it's okay because...

64
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,940
I should be able to play anything that I want today.

65
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,400
How do I turn...

66
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,700
Hold on, I don't want Discord to message me again.

67
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,160
How do I turn the streamer mode back on?

68
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Streamer mode...

69
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,800
I don't know how to do it.

70
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,730
Just gonna exit out.

71
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,950
Just gonna leave.

72
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,250
Quit Discord.

73
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,470
Quit Discord.

74
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:23,930
Okay.

75
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,750
We're disconnecting for real.

76
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,750
Settings, app settings, streamer...

77
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:30,770
Thank you.

78
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,970
W Hammer.

79
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,730
Honk.

80
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,490
Honk.

81
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,190
Did you guys notice we're on a different side of the screen?

82
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,670
Actually, I actually... actually...

83
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,210
I flipped my monitors.

84
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,150
So now...

85
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,710
You guys are on the right side.

86
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,010
She be moving around.

87
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,490
I know, isn't it so exciting to...

88
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,770
to...

89
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:01,930
to...

90
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,590
go to a different spot?

91
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,170
Why are you guys a clown emoji?

92
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,150
Why are you guys a clown emoji, huh?

93
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,150
Andricos, thanks for the 10 gifted.

94
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,070
Thank you.

95
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,990
Keep us on our toes.

96
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,910
Absolutely.

97
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,250
Absolutely.

98
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,990
What was it?

99
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,830
W Hammer, can you post it again?

100
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,730
I lost it.

101
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,650
Wait, um...

102
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,610
Oh!

103
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,070
It's enabled already.

104
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,030
Never mind.

105
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,890
It's because I reopened or...

106
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,790
I got it.

107
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,570
We're good.

108
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,590
I think it's because I quit.

109
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,870
Settings, app settings, streamer.

110
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,770
Thank you.

111
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,650
Even Bazongas cannot overcome the urge to return to Monkey.

112
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,390
Happy May Day to my favorite maid.

113
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,330
Thank you.

114
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,450
Yeah, I was like...

115
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,730
Maybe I should, uh...

116
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,130
Maybe I should, like...

117
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,890
play whatever I want.

118
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,030
Because it is maid day.

119
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,250
It's my day!

120
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,990
Actually, did you guys know that there's a Minto day?

121
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,490
Um...

122
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,990
Unfortunately, we missed it.

123
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,230
It's, uh...

124
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,570
March 10th.

125
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,850
But it's me.

126
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,890
Like, three in Japanese is three.

127
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,010
And then, in Japanese, ten can be read as tol.

128
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,090
So, Minto.

129
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,720
Mario Day?

130
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,320
That guy's stealing my gig!

131
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,480
No, it's Minto Day.

132
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,060
It's not Mario Day.

133
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,960
Forget about Mario!

134
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,240
Don't listen to him.

135
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,540
Forget about Mario.

136
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,480
Forget about Mario.

137
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,220
Forget about Mario.

138
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,960
Forget about Mario.

139
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,600
You can see I've played a little bit.

140
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,520
Not so much, though.

141
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,100
Oh, should we do the balloon?

142
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,660
But I've already done this one.

143
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,830
Happy Elatement Day.

144
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,510
Thanks!

145
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,610
My Toes Day?

146
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,670
What do you mean by that, Hugo?

147
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,470
I can see the Aurora Borealis from my bedroom.

148
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,630
Wait, actually?

149
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,710
At this time of day...

150
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,130
I mean, at this time...

151
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,350
Wait.

152
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,730
All localized within...

153
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,550
the out...

154
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,370
out...

155
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,070
out...

156
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,730
out...

157
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,370
of your...

158
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,650
bedroom.

159
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,590
Sorry.

160
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,430
My brain is not working very well today.

161
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,490
I think my brain is...

162
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,330
No, I saw some people talking about the Aurora Borealis today, though.

163
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,790
Yeah, you got it.

164
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,530
It's the spirit.

165
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,370
It's the spirit.

166
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,430
Right?

167
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,310
It's the spirit.

168
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,330
I can never forget about Mario.

169
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,090
I can't believe Minto is broke after her time in the balloon's war.

170
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,070
Which one should we do?

171
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,970
Which one should we do, you guys?

172
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,670
We can do any of them.

173
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,210
Oh, this one's kind of spooky.

174
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,470
I love spooky.

175
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,950
It has a bonus reward.

176
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,010
Let's do this one.

177
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,230
I just really want to get off this menu.

178
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,310
I'm going to put everything to the same.

179
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,390
Yes?

180
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,310
Yes?

181
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,390
Yes?

182
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,380
Yes?

183
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:34,780
Yes?

184
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,260
Yes?

185
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:35,880
Yes?

186
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,240
Why isn't it working?

187
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,260
Yes?

188
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,300
Yes?

189
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,900
Yes?

190
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,240
Why isn't it...

191
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,040
Yes?

192
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,830
Yes?

193
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,130
Hello?

194
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,570
Yes?

195
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:02,530
Yes?

196
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,950
Yes?

197
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,830
Yes?

198
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,830
Yes?

199
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:06,910
Yes?

200
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,770
You have to hold on to...

201
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:08,950
Yes?

202
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,610
Yes?

203
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:10,490
Yes?

204
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,490
Yes?

205
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:11,710
Yes?

206
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,050
Welcome to membership.

207
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,690
Thank you.

208
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:14,950
Yes?

209
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,550
Yes?

210
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,030
Yes?

211
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,830
Yes?

212
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,850
Yes?

213
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,290
Yes?

214
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,050
Yes?

215
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:19,870
Yes?

216
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,450
Sir.

217
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,950
Yes?

218
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,390
Sir.

219
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,950
Yes?

220
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,070
Yes?

221
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,810
Yes?

222
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,050
Yes?

223
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,110
Yes?

224
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,510
What?

225
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,030
That is so weird that you like hold on to it.

226
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,890
Yes?

227
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:36,750
Yes?

228
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,810
Yes?

229
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:38,950
Yes?

230
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,850
I'm probably gonna play this a little poorly.

231
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,110
I think there's also this monkey.

232
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:51,090
I have yet to unlock that monkey.

233
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,290
I actually don't even know what this monkey is.

234
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,850
I think when I was playing before, this monkey did not exist.

235
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,030
And March 9th is Miku.

236
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,490
March 9th, thank you!

237
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,610
Fairy baby!

238
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,630
Welcome to membership, thank you!

239
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,890
Thank you, thank you!

240
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,430
I thought you were a god gamer.

241
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,230
I am a...

242
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,850
Why no perfect gameplay?

243
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:21,730
Actually, Matara and I were recording the Patreon side of the podcast today.

244
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,630
Like almost... not just before this, but...

245
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,730
And I was like, man, I really just want to play Bloons.

246
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,150
We got actually like really into talking about Bloons, even before we were recording.

247
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,710
But I was just like, you know...

248
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,410
One thing that...

249
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,250
When I play...

250
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,870
People will be like...

251
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,310
Oh my gosh.

252
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:42,990
Sorry, Matara.

253
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,030
I'm leaking...

254
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,670
I'm leaking Patreon content.

255
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,350
When... I was like...

256
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,150
When I play...

257
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,970
And like...

258
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:55,610
You know...

259
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,090
I don't put my monkeys in the exact way that like...

260
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,590
Bloonslover777 put them in on YouTube for the optimal Bloons gameplay.

261
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,110
People are just like...

262
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,490
No!

263
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:07,570
No!

264
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:07,710
No!

265
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,470
Why would you put that monkey there?

266
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,130
Why would you put that monkey there?

267
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,650
It's so funny.

268
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,530
The meta monkey.

269
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,550
But Matara said that she really likes Ninja Monkey.

270
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:28,690
And...

271
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,410
Boomerang Monkey.

272
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,410
So those are going to be my focuses today.

273
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,070
Because...

274
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,550
I have not played with them at all.

275
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,470
And...

276
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,170
I usually play with Dart Monkey.

277
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,570
Bomb Monkey.

278
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,870
Tack Monkey.

279
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,570
Sniper Monkey.

280
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,310
Sticky Monkey.

281
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,670
Bucket Monkey.

282
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,470
Heli Monkey.

283
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,150
Magic Monkey.

284
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:00,470
Oh!

285
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,910
No.

286
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,850
Alchemist Monkey.

287
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,150
Sniper Monkey is cool.

288
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,510
Sniper Monkey is so good.

289
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,290
Actually, can you stand on top of this?

290
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,770
Oh, come on.

291
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,670
Come on.

292
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,610
That's a perfect spot.

293
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,190
That's a perfect spot.

294
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:17,870
$500!

295
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:20,930
Anyway.

296
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,430
Mint Monkey.

297
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,270
Can't wait for him to go...

298
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:26,650
Seriously?

299
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,590
So basically, everything except for those who...

300
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,210
It's not everything.

301
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,410
There's still a good bit in here.

302
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:34,990
Oh!

303
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,990
I started using the Gatling Monkey recently.

304
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:38,950
Oh!

305
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,910
And the House Monkey.

306
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,490
Monkey Village.

307
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,990
Well, I'm gonna put a Boomerang Monkey.

308
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,410
Can I afford him actually?

309
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,570
Boomerang Monkey is gonna go...

310
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,310
Okay, where should I put Boomerang Monkey?

311
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:04,350
If you want to unlock that locked monkey, click on the monkey next to the fountain in the main area and click monkey.

312
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,090
There should be a quest floor.

313
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,310
Where is the Maid Monkey?

314
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,410
Right here!

315
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,210
Do you guys want some coffee ASMR?

316
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,750
I got a can of coffee here.

317
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,110
I'm gonna open it.

318
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,370
Hold on.

319
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,770
Here, I'll even turn off my noise gate.

320
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,630
Alright.

321
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,230
This is some...

322
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:33,730
ASMR...

323
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,270
Can coffee.

324
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,150
My

325
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,720
sleeves are in the way.

326
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Sorry.

327
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,100
Coffee ASMR.

328
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,180
Yummy.

329
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,740
Okay.

330
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,440
Can monkeys hang out on the bridge?

331
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:24,740
No.

332
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,800
I just don't know how to use a Boomerang Monkey.

333
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,880
I'm gonna put him...

334
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,380
I'm gonna put him right here.

335
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,300
He's not gonna know what to do either.

336
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,360
Actually, he's kind of pricey.

337
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,660
What does he do though?

338
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,520
Why is a Boomerang Monkey so good?

339
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,480
Maybe I put it here.

340
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,860
I love this bit so much.

341
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,140
What are you talking about?

342
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,080
It's not a bit.

343
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,400
High Pierce.

344
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,340
Boomerang is honestly cracked.

345
00:16:59,620 --> 00:16:59,940
Is he?

346
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,280
Rangs aren't cheap.

347
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,060
Okay.

348
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:03,940
Okay.

349
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,500
I'm gonna give him...

350
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,360
I'm gonna give him...

351
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm gonna...

352
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,040
I'm gonna...

353
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm nervous.

354
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,140
People are gonna be like, your monkey placement's so bad.

355
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,320
Oh my gosh.

356
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
Whenever I play...

357
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,980
Whenever I play by myself, I'm like, put a monkey anywhere.

358
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,630
Hold on.

359
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,790
Just ignore them?

360
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,090
Okay.

361
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,290
I'm gonna ignore them.

362
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,510
Just like Miss Cat said.

363
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,970
What do they do?

364
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,370
A Pops A Balloons.

365
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,290
Moab Press.

366
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,040
Is that related to the mating press?

367
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,340
Moab Press is goated.

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,560
Don't say it.

369
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,120
The Primate Press.

370
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,560
The Primate Press.

371
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,280
Heavy Kylie Boomerang hits Moab-class Bloons multiple times per throw and sometimes knocks them back a short way along the path.

372
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,720
Okay.

373
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,520
I'm gonna put him right here.

374
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,940
And we're gonna put a little dart monkey right here because I want him to be there.

375
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,460
Moab means mother of all bombs.

376
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,320
It does?

377
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,520
I'm just happy to see you play monkey game again.

378
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,700
Thanks.

379
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,960
I don't think I've ever streamed it here.

380
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,760
Minter monkey placement is so bad.

381
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:04,960
Yeah.

382
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,980
Cry about it.

383
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,400
Cry about my monkey placement.

384
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,720
Okay.

385
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,580
Yeah.

386
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,580
You might be wondering why did you place him all the way over there?

387
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,900
He's too good.

388
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,860
This monkey was nervous.

389
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,260
This monkey said I won't work if he's too close to me.

390
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,220
He's like this guy is like too cool.

391
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,500
He's nervous about it.

392
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,340
Oh my gosh.

393
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,980
Don't let them through.

394
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,080
Don't let them through.

395
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,980
I'm gonna upgrade him.

396
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,440
I have the crossbow master.

397
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,420
Oh, I can do the super fan.

398
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,260
Is this one any good?

399
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,000
The super fan?

400
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,960
This monkey business is getting out of business.

401
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,240
Can the monkey business go out of business?

402
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:53,820
I wonder.

403
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,820
It's not meta, but it sure is funny.

404
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,240
Got it.

405
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,900
Go juggernaut.

406
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,500
Juggernaut.

407
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,340
I was like trying to...

408
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,240
It's slow though, isn't it?

409
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,500
Because this one says it's a slower attacking spike-apult.

410
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,260
So I was like, I love the spikes.

411
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,680
Depends on the amount of dart monkeys.

412
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,340
Ah.

413
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,620
It says converts up to 10 years.

414
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:24,840
But...

415
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,340
Oh, they gotta be dart monkeys.

416
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,660
Oh.

417
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,020
What if I have a whole field of only dart monkeys?

418
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
But I do have crossbow master.

419
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,540
So we'll go for that one.

420
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,540
You guys, I think we're in trouble.

421
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,640
What?

422
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,090
You fool.

423
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,670
Oh, we should give enough money for this guy.

424
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:03,770
Uh-oh.

425
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,650
Okay.

426
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,630
Come on, boomerang monkey.

427
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,690
Everybody believes in you.

428
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,370
Come on, boomerang monkey.

429
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,050
Nice.

430
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,450
Wait, I have an upgrade.

431
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,070
So moab press.

432
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,050
Let's go for that one.

433
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,670
I also want the red hot rangs.

434
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,820
Nice.

435
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,500
Nice.

436
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:28,960
Nice.

437
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,220
Nice.

438
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,900
The spicy rangs.

439
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,540
You rang.

440
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,960
We're saving up for forest monkey.

441
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,260
Nice.

442
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:48,600
Oh.

443
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,100
Oh.

444
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,460
Oh.

445
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,100
Where should I put him, though?

446
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,340
This path is kind of difficult.

447
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,980
Because it's like...

448
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,240
It feels like it just...

449
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,320
Anywhere I put it...

450
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,380
Anywhere I put a monkey, it doesn't cover enough ground.

451
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:02,940
You know what I mean?

452
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,260
Hey, mean toe.

453
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,620
I forgot that I had the room on my phone.

454
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,380
Got a big surprise while driving a client to his work.

455
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:18,820
Oopsie.

456
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,540
Your monkey placement is just fine.

457
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,060
It's just as random and awesome as you are.

458
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Thanks, Zach.

459
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,540
Thank you.

460
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,440
Thank you.

461
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,680
The near the first U-turn.

462
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,300
Right here?

463
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,300
Here.

464
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,360
Here.

465
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,580
The spirits of the forest awaken.

466
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,240
Oh, my God.

467
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,580
It's so loud.

468
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,200
It spooked me.

469
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,640
Yes.

470
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,800
Yes.

471
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,780
Yes.

472
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,780
Yes.

473
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,780
Yes.

474
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,200
Yes.

475
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,700
Yes.

476
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:51,840
Yes.

477
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes.

478
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,520
Yes.

479
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:52,720
Yes.

480
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,620
Yes.

481
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,600
Yes.

482
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,620
Yes.

483
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,720
Yes.

484
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,740
Yes.

485
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,620
Yes.

486
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,540
Yes.

487
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes?

488
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,460
Yeah.

489
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,140
Attack them.

490
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,700
Attack them.

491
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,220
Attack them.

492
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:06,900
Yes?

493
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,040
Yes?

494
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,220
Ha ha.

495
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,260
Ha ha.

496
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,740
What's the monkey that says yes?

497
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,350
I think I'll switch to him next time.

498
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,080
Quincy.

499
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,840
Satan.

500
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,500
No.

501
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:29,960
No.

502
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,700
He's not that bad, right?

503
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,940
It's my first time seeing this game.

504
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,240
Why do they all have Ikemen voice?

505
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,280
This only...

506
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,740
This guy is a wise monkey.

507
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,580
See?

508
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,720
I always read his name wrong though.

509
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,940
O-B-Y-N.

510
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,860
Green foot.

511
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,440
Oh.

512
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,940
That's a lot of blue.

513
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,840
Handle it.

514
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,150
You guys stop...

515
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,330
Wait.

516
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:04,790
I thought...

517
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:04,970
Wait.

518
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,050
Oh.

519
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,670
Target.

520
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,150
Target?

521
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,390
No.

522
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,130
It's Oben.

523
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,190
You guys are typing his name wrong.

524
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,140
My fave is Pat Fusty.

525
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,780
How do you misread it usually?

526
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,240
Oh, yeah.

527
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,360
I said I was also going to use him.

528
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:38,820
Okay.

529
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm going to try some other monkeys.

530
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,200
This guy is...

531
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,340
I also need to level up.

532
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,380
As you see, I have no...

533
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,280
Nothing for him.

534
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,840
My goal is to get to level 100.

535
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,900
I think balloons would win IRL.

536
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,640
That's where you're wrong.

537
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,120
That's where you're so wrong.

538
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,660
I read the game title as Balloon Titty 6.

539
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,540
So, imagine my surprise when I open the stream.

540
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,320
Jonesypoo, you just have...

541
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,860
You...

542
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,460
Um...

543
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,940
You are...

544
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,600
You...

545
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,040
You have a friend.

546
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,020
Rightyaxcoidianslip.

547
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,950
Thanks for the raid.

548
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,330
Hello.

549
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,250
Hello, everybody.

550
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,810
Hihihi.

551
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,570
I was on Lea's stream yesterday, if you haven't watched it.

552
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,610
Oh, oh, hold on.

553
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,930
Let me also unpin this.

554
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,410
Thank you.

555
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:47,750
Thank you, YouTube.

556
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,130
Raymac, thanks for gifting.

557
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,690
Oh, the sex things for gifting.

558
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,010
Barbie, thanks for gifting.

559
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,430
That's her因為 We got shamed.

560
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:56,810
Yippee!

561
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,130
What do you mean?

562
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,170
What are you talking about?

563
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,620
Definitely go watch the collab on Lia's channel.

564
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,540
So fun.

565
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,780
I'm playing with monkeys right now.

566
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,700
Oh my gosh.

567
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,460
Thank you for... I'm gifted, you guys!

568
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,560
Wait, wait, wait.

569
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,900
AKS, TF2, thank you!

570
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,900
Kenja, thank you!

571
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,960
Rock4Robot, thank you!

572
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,040
Fun Comics, thank you!

573
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,840
And Draco, thank you!

574
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,260
Yep, collab was great.

575
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,140
She judged my fashion.

576
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,220
But in a good way.

577
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,100
Alright.

578
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,860
Monkey, monkey.

579
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,520
I don't know what I'm saving up for.

580
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,640
Let's upgrade this monkey.

581
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,120
Okay, what's the best...

582
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
way of the ninja?

583
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,600
What is the best path of the ninja?

584
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,680
E-moment?

585
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,420
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you!

586
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,460
Over again!

587
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,440
What anime characters are you gonna base your fashion on now?

588
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,440
I don't think I've ever based my fashion on an anime character because...

589
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,220
I don't even know.

590
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,700
Like, I feel like...

591
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,220
so many anime characters...

592
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,960
Oh, no!

593
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,220
Well, okay.

594
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,280
In the past, I always wanted to, like, look like Paradise Kiss.

595
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,060
But...

596
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,740
My son got me into you recently.

597
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,960
This is his favorite game.

598
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,240
Just wanted to thank my son, Pat Fusty.

599
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,640
Why do you hate your son, Rachel?

600
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,140
Ashen, thanks for the gift.

601
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,360
I know a lot of YouTubers have big heads, but I think you have had...

602
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,360
But I think if you had no hair, you could fit three faces on yours.

603
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,660
Why are you so mean to me?

604
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,840
What the hell is this?

605
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,400
I'm asking for help and...

606
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,170
Pat Fusty is a name of honor?

607
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,750
I think Mint's monkey placement sucks!

608
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:20,770
Yeah?

609
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,430
I'm gonna make you cringe tonight.

610
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,790
Do you play Cookie Clicker?

611
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,230
I do.

612
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,010
You guys, what's the best way of the ninja?

613
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,570
Stop getting off topic.

614
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,070
Who cares if my head is big?

615
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,170
And my neck is extendable.

616
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,830
And my hair is jelly, apparently.

617
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,950
It's not a comment someone made.

618
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,930
It was like a clip of me or something, I think.

619
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,850
And they were like, Wow, Mint's hair is just made of jello.

620
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:02,690
Or whatever.

621
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,810
I was like...

622
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:04,770
Yow!

623
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,190
Backseaters, where you at?

624
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,730
IDK, I'm not a ninja.

625
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,670
Five, five, five, go to...

626
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:16,790
Wait.

627
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,310
Wait, I don't...

628
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,870
Two...

629
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,290
Wait, I don't remember what that means.

630
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,890
Wait, two, two, five?

631
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,890
So, seeking shuriken?

632
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,230
Ten should be first?

633
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,430
Top path.

634
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,710
Oh, that...

635
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,530
Green Ninja said top path.

636
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,910
And Green Ninja is a ninja.

637
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,310
So...

638
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,830
Five, zero, two.

639
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:44,690
Okay.

640
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,990
Top path is good early.

641
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:50,730
Unlock!

642
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,730
Wait, so...

643
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,910
Someone said five, zero, two.

644
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:54,890
So I'll do this one too.

645
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,710
Nice.

646
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,150
What are you doing?

647
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:00,550
What are you doing?

648
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,170
Do your job!

649
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:02,950
Oh, whoa.

650
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:03,450
Whoa!

651
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:04,950
Wowee!

652
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:05,930
Look at him go!

653
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,110
I'm glad we can...

654
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,530
Four, two, zero.

655
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,570
What did you say?

656
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,990
I said you're a ninja.

657
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:30,930
It's in your name.

658
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,630
I think I've told this to someone before, but you can change the size of the cursor, etc.

659
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,570
By clicking hotkeys.

660
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,410
Extra large cursor.

661
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,330
Extra large cursor.

662
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,670
Thank you.

663
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,710
You guys wanna see my big finger?

664
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,430
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

665
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,090
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

666
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,670
Has the Dr. Stone hair?

667
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,710
No, Dr. Stone has my hair.

668
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:06,710
Watch

669
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,960
where you're tickling.

670
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,680
Sorry, I didn't know that we were...

671
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,640
You know.

672
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,960
Okay.

673
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,100
Let's just...

674
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,540
Let's do...

675
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,580
Hmm...

676
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,080
Let's do...

677
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,120
Quick shots instead.

678
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,580
Very quick shots.

679
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:48,100
I feel like in this game, quick is most important, right?

680
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,120
We'll just keep collecting money.

681
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,740
This guy down here...

682
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,420
This is Dart Monkey 7.

683
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,500
He is our backup support.

684
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,300
Gotta go fast.

685
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,680
I finally made a monkey.

686
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,440
You've made a monkey out of me.

687
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,860
You must be swift as the coursing river.

688
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,300
With all the strength of a great typhoon.

689
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,280
With all the speed of a ninja monkey.

690
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,700
Mysterious eyes, the dark side of the moon.

691
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,860
Be monkey.

692
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,300
I was thinking maybe I would do English karaoke next week.

693
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,380
I keep saying I'm not going to do karaoke with my voice stressed.

694
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,380
But also, so fun.

695
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,940
I haven't done English karaoke.

696
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,780
Is your voice okay?

697
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,000
I think so.

698
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:15,500
I think the hardest part is like when I have to record the podcast and also like talk for a long time like on stream and everything that was also part of today I was like, I don't think I really want to talk so much in like reading a visual novel.

699
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,720
So, please sing Bee Monkey version of the song.

700
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,660
Any chance of karaoke of the man who sold the world?

701
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,780
I'd have to learn it, but I can do it.

702
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,220
I graduated college today.

703
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,900
Thanks for helping me get through finals.

704
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,120
Congrats Red Cross!

705
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,720
Congrats!

706
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:42,860
Congrats!

707
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,820
Oh my gosh!

708
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,040
You did it!

709
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,920
The man who sold the world.

710
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,440
The man who sold the world.

711
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,120
The good G word.

712
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,940
Yeah.

713
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,240
Yes!

714
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,860
Well with this I can just sit and back and kind of let the monkeys do the work.

715
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,700
Yeah.

716
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,300
Send out, send out your stuff.

717
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,520
Oh wow, they're getting really fast.

718
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,340
Oh, we have so much money.

719
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:22,820
Okay.

720
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:30,580
This might be a little, you know, like premature, but I think we got to start getting a farm.

721
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,700
Wait, where can I even put a farm in this map?

722
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,360
Oh my gosh.

723
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,860
A green day karaoke.

724
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,780
A Metal Gear Rising karaoke.

725
00:34:50,680 --> 00:35:04,220
I am so nervous about that though because like, I feel, I feel, oh yes, this one's good.

726
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,100
Nice.

727
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,960
I don't, I just don't feel like I'll sing them good, but I guess it's, you know, I don't have to sing it well.

728
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,180
I can just sing it for fun, right?

729
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
I thought this is a bunny garden stream.

730
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,180
I'm so sorry.

731
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,980
I'm so sorry.

732
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,140
I'm so sorry.

733
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,080
I just, I only had monkey on the brain.

734
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
I'm really, really sorry.

735
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,280
I'm really sorry that I'm only thinking about monkey.

736
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,640
Oh no!

737
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,780
Uh oh, uh oh.

738
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,220
I thought we were doomed.

739
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,520
I thought we were doomed.

740
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,200
Get a boat, you buffoon.

741
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,580
You're so right!

742
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,760
You're so right, actually.

743
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,280
Boat monkey!

744
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,900
Ahoy!

745
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:18,630
What's the, oh, um, it is, uh, this monkey that can turn them into gold.

746
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,330
This monkey will turn our lead balloons into gold.

747
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,810
I kind of want him to do that.

748
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,810
Let's put him here.

749
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,150
Oh no, I have to upgrade it.

750
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,150
Okay, we'll get him.

751
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,370
I'll get enough money.

752
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,610
I only have monkey on the brain, so nothing changed.

753
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,970
The more things change, sometimes the more they stay the same.

754
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:48,770
Right?

755
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,770
Happy May Day.

756
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,850
Happy May Day!

757
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,410
I really want...

758
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,350
Look at this, we have lead and spikes.

759
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,260
Double shot.

760
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,760
Double shot.

761
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,420
Wow, balloon jutsu!

762
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,810
Do you guys ever wonder why we are on the right side of the screen now?

763
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,630
Oh wait, I told you.

764
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,210
Never mind.

765
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,220
Sorry.

766
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,620
Actually there is another reason.

767
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,660
Okay, I'm just really excited.

768
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,240
Okay?

769
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,540
More people joined, you can say again.

770
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,700
There's another reason that you guys are on the right side of the screen now instead of the left side of the screen.

771
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,120
I asked earlier... because usually I have my chat settings on the right side.

772
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,520
And... and... not chat settings.

773
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,060
I don't know why I said settings.

774
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,620
My chat on the right side... or left side and me on the left side too.

775
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,460
But I moved my monitors.

776
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,240
So I moved all of us over to the right side.

777
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,020
Can I just show you guys?

778
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,220
Can I just show you guys?

779
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,720
Can I show you?

780
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,860
Actually, it's May Day.

781
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,820
So I'm gonna show you guys, okay?

782
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,020
It's May Day.

783
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,060
It's May Day.

784
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,080
It's May Day!

785
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,580
May Day!

786
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,240
Oh!

787
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,580
I'm drowning!

788
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,520
May Day!

789
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:42,940
May Day!

790
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,280
The

791
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:13,670
maid cafe may have gotten an upgrade!

792
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,790
Isn't it so cute?

793
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,210
Isn't it so cute?

794
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,870
I say upgrade even though there's like some cobwebs and some dead plants in here.

795
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,370
It's okay.

796
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,110
I'm working on it.

797
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,650
Isn't it so cute?

798
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,010
Yeah!

799
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,810
And then we have some patrons in the cafe.

800
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:46,530
Yes.

801
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,630
Excuse me!

802
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,930
You up there!

803
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,250
Please get back to your seat.

804
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,150
You're causing a disturbance.

805
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,230
Hold on.

806
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,930
I'll show you guys.

807
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,370
With my monkey music in the background.

808
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,290
Okay.

809
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:03,630
Hold on.

810
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:03,930
Hold on.

811
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,630
Sorry.

812
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,530
I'm gonna get rid of the chat real quick.

813
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,470
Oh, wait.

814
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:11,970
Okay.

815
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:15,910
Hold on.

816
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,510
I'll zoom in.

817
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,590
I'll zoom in.

818
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,170
I'll zoom in.

819
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:19,710
I'll zoom in.

820
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,390
You didn't see anything.

821
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,220
There we go.

822
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:36,680
Okay.

823
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,000
Hold on.

824
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,040
Hold on.

825
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,060
I'm a little scuffed right now.

826
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:40,320
Okay.

827
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:40,900
There we go.

828
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,560
Okay.

829
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,000
See, you got some ghosts here.

830
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,220
Look at them.

831
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,400
They're just...

832
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,200
I think they're...

833
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,300
I think this guy is...

834
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,400
He's having like a first date or something.

835
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,920
He looks really nervous.

836
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,840
You got this guy singing back there.

837
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,640
He's so cute.

838
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:58,800
Yeah.

839
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,520
He's like...

840
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,060
La-la-la.

841
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,920
La-la-la-la-la.

842
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,580
La-la-la-la-la.

843
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,680
And the busting sign, of course, is still there.

844
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,260
Of course.

845
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,140
It must always be there.

846
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,920
My play button!

847
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,260
Because I'm a real YouTuber.

848
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,980
I'm a real YouTuber.

849
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,380
So I have my play button in the background.

850
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,500
These guys are enjoying a hot cup of joe.

851
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,580
Yeah.

852
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,500
This guy is my favorite over here.

853
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,640
Just like chilling back there.

854
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,740
He's like...

855
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,680
And a little counter here.

856
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,540
Oh, and the stage.

857
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,520
Yeah.

858
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:43,430
That's it.

859
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,270
That's it!

860
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:54,350
That's it!

861
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:54,870
Where did I go?

862
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,750
Oh, I'm down here.

863
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,250
Isn't it so cute?

864
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,430
Isn't it so cute?

865
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,850
So, welcome to the new maid cafe!

866
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,160
Why are we on the menu?

867
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,720
Because you're a snack.

868
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,080
Snack!

869
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,110
Get off the stage!

870
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,090
I could be... I could be over there.

871
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,070
Welcome

872
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:42,690
back!

873
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:43,630
Miss!

874
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,510
Why is the chat going so fast?

875
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,110
What's happening?

876
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,310
Oh.

877
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,250
Today is maid day!

878
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,030
So I'm going to play monkey!

879
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:04,890
Oh, wait!

880
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,010
My favorite song!

881
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:07,950
Monkey!

882
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:11,530
Ooh!

883
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:11,970
Ooh!

884
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:37,960
Monkey!

885
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,180
It's time for monkey!

886
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,540
Monkey time!

887
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,800
Monkey time!

888
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,920
Monkey time!

889
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,220
Break it down!

890
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,010
Why am I so tiny?

891
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,350
Thank you!

892
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:40,950
Thank you!

893
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:41,970
Thank you!

894
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,770
I want this as my ringtone.

895
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,650
Okay, let's get back to the monkey business now.

896
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,870
Sorry, monkeys.

897
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,950
Oh, there goes the chat.

898
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:01,550
It's zooming.

899
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:03,550
Do I

900
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,580
know any Funky Monkey Babies next?

901
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,680
I do!

902
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,240
I do know Funky Monkey Babies.

903
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,550
Oh, this one.

904
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:27,590
I usually do this one.

905
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,660
Incredible performance?

906
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,900
It mesmerized me.

907
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,620
New Rainforest Cafe, looking good.

908
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,240
Yeah, I hope you guys like it.

909
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,520
I hope you guys like it.

910
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:54,880
Oh, wait.

911
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,800
So this one, and then maybe Faster Throw.

912
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,760
MOAB, Blue Blimps stand for... Oh!

913
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,780
Thanks to Chonky!

914
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,860
ZOMG stands for Zeppelin of Mighty...

915
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,200
Gargantuaness.

916
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,080
DDT!

917
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,900
I've never seen the B.A.D.

918
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,220
though.

919
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,920
Big Airship of Doom.

920
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,240
I don't think so, at least.

921
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,280
Definitely seen the DDTs.

922
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,940
It's always like, what?

923
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,000
Stage 93 that gets me?

924
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,460
When do the B.A.D.s come in?

925
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,400
B.A.D.s at round 100.

926
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:31,920
Oh!

927
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,520
What do you mean a permit for those curtains?

928
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,250
Bionic Boomerang.

929
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,180
I'll do the faster one.

930
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,800
Let's just start getting some... some cannons.

931
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,020
Don't let the health inspection see that cafe.

932
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,180
It's like, literally...

933
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,900
It's like, don't worry about it.

934
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,160
You don't even need to worry about it at all.

935
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,060
Cause... cause... it's like abandoned.

936
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,560
There's cobwebs, you guys.

937
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,980
The curtains are so close to the candles.

938
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,720
No,

939
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:33,880
they're not!

940
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,840
What the...

941
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,300
No, they're not!

942
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,240
There's only one candle!

943
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,000
And it's... it's... it's this one!

944
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,000
But the curtains aren't even any close to it!

945
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,360
This one right here that I'm pointing to.

946
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,140
It's the only candle.

947
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,500
Back off my cafe.

948
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,520
Okay.

949
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,260
Back!

950
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:14,640
Back!

951
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,000
Back!

952
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,780
You know what?

953
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,000
You don't deserve to be served here.

954
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,440
You come into my cafe first day in.

955
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,500
And you... complain?

956
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,960
Oh, my curtains!

957
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,180
My curtains are too close to the candle!

958
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,060
Oh, my food!

959
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:36,920
Oh no!

960
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,360
My food is made of... it has ectoplasm!

961
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,380
Oh, the curtain is on fire!

962
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,520
Oh, no!

963
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,860
The cafe is on fire!

964
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,320
Oh, no!

965
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,100
I'm dead!

966
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:49,650
Complaints!

967
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:50,690
You know what?

968
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:55,430
Go take it up... with... the manager.

969
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:57,530
The

970
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,020
manager.

971
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,640
It's me.

972
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:25,760
DJ!

973
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,260
DJ!

974
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,100
Welcome to the membership.

975
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:27,760
Thank you!

976
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,920
I'm the manager here.

977
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,900
Can I have a... alarm?

978
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,400
Okay.

979
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,060
Back to Monkey.

980
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,060
Oh!

981
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,580
Uh-oh.

982
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,560
I became too small.

983
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,020
There we go.

984
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:00,620
Okay.

985
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,240
Mint reaction corner.

986
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,660
Is that what you want?

987
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,820
Okay, guys.

988
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,400
Hey, guys.

989
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,400
Today we're playing Monkey.

990
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,820
Welcome back to Monkey.

991
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,520
Let's play Monkey game.

992
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,940
Let's play Monkey game.

993
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,960
Live Mint reaction.

994
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,260
It's like one of those Japanese TV shows.

995
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,500
You can't like see so much of the... right down here though.

996
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,060
Are you really okay with that?

997
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,580
Oh!

998
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,780
Handle it!

999
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,020
Sweet.

1000
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,280
We handled it.

1001
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,360
Oh yeah.

1002
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,200
I keep forgetting to upgrade this guy too.

1003
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,160
I was trying to make him rich.

1004
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,760
I'll give him this one too.

1005
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,360
Greetings, Minto.

1006
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,520
Long time donator and first time viewer patron of the maid cafe.

1007
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,700
I was burned by the molten chocolate dripping from this curtain.

1008
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,560
Can I get a discount on my meal as compensation?

1009
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,740
I'm really sorry but you signed the waiver when you came in.

1010
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,540
That says...

1011
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,620
I don't mind.

1012
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,480
Keep being burnt by the curtains.

1013
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,160
The molten chocolate is part of the cafe experience.

1014
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,340
Drunk.

1015
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,680
See us.

1016
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,100
Lest...

1017
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,900
Lest to my ose.

1018
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:37,980
Go!

1019
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,320
Don't drink and super chat.

1020
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,900
Yeah, there's a waiver.

1021
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,820
There's a waiver.

1022
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:55,980
Monkey!

1023
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:58,820
Monkey!

1024
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,980
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monk.

1025
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:12,910
This is the health inspector.

1026
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:15,150
Oh my gosh.

1027
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,990
You're binary ghost.

1028
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,470
So you're actually the health inspector.

1029
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,210
There have been reports of ectoplasm in the kitchen.

1030
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,170
That's a violation.

1031
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,250
Everybody scatter!

1032
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:24,930
Scatter!

1033
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,140
You guys, I'm lost.

1034
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,820
I don't know where I am.

1035
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,540
I'm lost.

1036
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:07,760
I'm lost.

1037
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,760
I don't know where I am.

1038
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,980
It's really dark here.

1039
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,600
I'm lost.

1040
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,960
Where am I?

1041
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,880
You guys, I'm trying to...

1042
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,880
Wait, wait.

1043
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,700
Wait, wait.

1044
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,020
Wait, wait.

1045
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,300
I'm lost.

1046
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,260
I'm lost.

1047
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:31,650
Hold on.

1048
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:32,790
Let me see if there's like a...

1049
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:34,970
Like a reset.

1050
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:36,130
Hold on.

1051
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,050
I'm lost.

1052
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:39,770
This isn't...

1053
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,930
This isn't supposed to be funny.

1054
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:42,710
This isn't a bit.

1055
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:44,370
I'm lost for real.

1056
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,150
I can't come back.

1057
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,650
I can't come...

1058
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,790
I'm clicking and dragging but I don't know where I am.

1059
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,430
I'm lost.

1060
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:54,890
I'm lost.

1061
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:55,390
I'm lost.

1062
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,060
I'm...

1063
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,640
Oh, my God.

1064
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,640
Oh, my God.

1065
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,460
I don't know.

1066
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,440
I thought I came in.

1067
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,880
No.

1068
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,500
I'm...

1069
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,180
I'm lost in VTube Studio.

1070
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,920
I don't know where I am.

1071
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,440
Okay, guys.

1072
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,220
There's only one thing that I can do here.

1073
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,720
Oh, my God.

1074
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,040
Hold on.

1075
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,840
Oh, I think...

1076
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,540
Okay, hold on.

1077
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,240
I have to recreate myself.

1078
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,900
I think using props...

1079
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,500
Okay, hold on.

1080
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,920
Oh no!

1081
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,540
Wait, I actually don't know where I am!

1082
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,980
Okay, I'm gonna be Hoshino today.

1083
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,800
Wait, how do I get it above?

1084
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,980
Wait.

1085
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,480
Oh no, wait!

1086
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,200
No, I can't move Hoshino now!

1087
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,560
Oh my god, hold on.

1088
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,780
No!

1089
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,440
Okay, hold on.

1090
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,940
Start over, redo, redo.

1091
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:06,880
Where am I?

1092
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,220
You guys, this is...

1093
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,420
Okay, I'm gonna...

1094
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,620
I don't...

1095
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,460
Use bit 1.0?

1096
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,300
I don't have bit 1.0!

1097
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,880
Actually, okay, I do have this.

1098
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,100
But I'm not sure how it will be.

1099
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,880
So I'm kinda nervous.

1100
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,820
Okay, hold on.

1101
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,840
Oh no!

1102
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,480
No!

1103
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,020
Um...

1104
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,400
You guys, it's...

1105
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,140
It's Goofy's smile.

1106
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,600
It's...

1107
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,140
It's...

1108
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,380
It's...

1109
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:57,760
It's...

1110
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,620
It's the one with...

1111
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,240
The big-ass smile.

1112
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,590
I'm so glad we played balloons today.

1113
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:19,450
I'm so glad we played balloons today.

1114
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:22,890
Look

1115
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:36,810
at myself!

1116
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,030
I can't...

1117
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:44,990
I can't even...

1118
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:45,170
I can't even...

1119
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,400
Okay, anyway.

1120
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,200
Let's balloon.

1121
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,670
Wow, they just keep coming.

1122
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,750
She's really into it.

1123
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,150
I'm having a good time.

1124
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:22,670
Oh, hold on.

1125
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,130
Actually, let me try something.

1126
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,290
F**k!

1127
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,410
It worked!

1128
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,920
Yippee!

1129
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,540
Your other flew out the window.

1130
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,520
Oh my goodness gracious.

1131
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,580
That was a silly bit of a...

1132
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,900
A little bit.

1133
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,880
I'm gonna start bringing in SniperMonkey.

1134
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,140
He's my favorite guy right here.

1135
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,980
SniperMonkey is my favorite guy right here.

1136
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,660
What's the best place to put him though?

1137
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,560
Hmm...

1138
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,230
Maybe here covers...

1139
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:27,750
No...

1140
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,370
Up here.

1141
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,270
Over here.

1142
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:31,350
No...

1143
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:31,710
No...

1144
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,790
Up here.

1145
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:39,750
Sniper's a good job mate.

1146
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:42,850
Welcome back.

1147
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,230
It's been like 10,000 years.

1148
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:45,990
I can't believe I got lost.

1149
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,450
Bottom right might be better.

1150
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,310
Oh, he's gone.

1151
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:53,930
Wait, hold on.

1152
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:59,410
Bottom right.

1153
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,190
No...

1154
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,710
It's because of the house.

1155
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,910
I'm on top of the house though.

1156
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:08,670
Hmm...

1157
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:11,890
Shouldn't have gone towards the light.

1158
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:13,610
Shouldn't have gone towards the light.

1159
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:15,750
Where's the dart monkey?

1160
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:16,250
This one?

1161
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:17,990
Yeah, I think you're right.

1162
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,110
I think you're right.

1163
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:22,590
We missed behind the car, but I think it'll be okay.

1164
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,770
We'll put some other guys over here eventually.

1165
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,070
I'm also gonna add...

1166
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:28,910
Okay, hold on.

1167
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:29,850
How do I want to do this?

1168
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,030
Because I do want to put a village.

1169
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:32,690
Oh my goodness.

1170
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:34,870
The village takes up so much space.

1171
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,610
3D balloons game would be crazy.

1172
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:44,850
Didn't you...

1173
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:47,090
Didn't know you enjoyed these monkeys that much.

1174
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:47,990
Just look at that smile.

1175
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,610
I'm a monkey fiend!

1176
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:55,730
I love balloons!

1177
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:59,010
Gosh, this one's really hard to fit in though.

1178
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:02,950
Gosh, this one's really hard to fit in though.

1179
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:04,130
And click on the car and remove it.

1180
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:04,730
Actually, you know what?

1181
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,110
We have enough money to get rid of it.

1182
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,830
You just ran my monkey over!

1183
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,350
Oh my god.

1184
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,350
Oh my gosh.

1185
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:19,010
Stonks, stonks, stonks, stonks!

1186
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,610
And uh, wait.

1187
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,470
That's not who I wanted to click on.

1188
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:23,710
You.

1189
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,330
No, we're waiting for the balloon jutsu.

1190
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,370
Stonks, stonks, stonks!

1191
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,310
Stonks, stonks, stonks!

1192
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:33,570
More money!

1193
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,010
Um...

1194
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,850
Okay, I'm gonna put him...

1195
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:40,630
here.

1196
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,650
I think maybe I will put a little town there.

1197
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:47,050
Let's go for the Moab...

1198
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:48,970
Assassin.

1199
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:49,770
Okay.

1200
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:51,570
Oh!

1201
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,270
You hear that money?

1202
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,590
Baby!

1203
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:59,310
Awesome!

1204
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:00,270
Awesome!

1205
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,850
Your super silly smile or model reminds me of honey and clover.

1206
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,250
Man, you're so rich.

1207
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,790
I also like...

1208
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,470
I'm bad about like...

1209
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,170
I'm like, what if I want to save up, you know?

1210
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,490
I want him to get to 21.

1211
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:17,670
I gotta save up.

1212
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,750
Well, right now, we don't need to do any more spending.

1213
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:24,630
I think we're doing okay.

1214
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:28,390
Extra

1215
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:36,690
money!

1216
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,250
Is it really making that much money?

1217
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:38,950
I can't tell.

1218
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,230
Truly, I can't tell.

1219
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:42,710
Oh, and let's upgrade you.

1220
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:44,430
Um...

1221
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,130
We'll go...

1222
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,890
We'll go with the Moab meme.

1223
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:57,940
Nice gift!

1224
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,080
Binary goals!

1225
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,200
Thanks for the 10 gifts!

1226
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,980
For Fox's sake!

1227
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,980
Thanks for the 5 gifts!

1228
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:11,380
Thank you!

1229
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:12,600
Hey!

1230
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:21,540
Oh my god.

1231
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:23,940
Get him!

1232
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,140
So

1233
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,240
fast, so easily!

1234
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,520
Sniper monkey!

1235
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,200
You know what?

1236
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,180
I'm gonna put another sniper monkey and I'm gonna make him shoot faster.

1237
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,680
Fast sniper monkey.

1238
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:52,700
Yeah...

1239
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:53,960
Oh!

1240
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:58,760
There we go.

1241
01:02:59,220 --> 01:02:59,960
Upgrade the bow.

1242
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,560
I don't have any more...

1243
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,180
I don't have any more that I can upgrade.

1244
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,260
I'm gonna put another boat though.

1245
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,180
We'll put another boat.

1246
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:12,350
Here.

1247
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,370
Wait, can I put another boat right here?

1248
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:18,470
No.

1249
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,250
I think I might... I can put one there.

1250
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:22,810
Three boats!

1251
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,650
Machine gun sniper monkey.

1252
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:28,770
He's cracked!

1253
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,750
That's why I like the sniper monkey so much.

1254
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:32,750
Um...

1255
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,650
What was I...

1256
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:34,910
Oh!

1257
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:36,950
I realized I don't hear...

1258
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:38,230
Um...

1259
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,850
Streamlabs for some reason.

1260
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:40,950
I'm so sorry you guys.

1261
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,170
I might have to turn them up.

1262
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,010
Um...

1263
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,530
I'm the lone wisp at the corner vibing.

1264
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:47,950
Don't worry.

1265
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,670
Ghost fire from ghost candles doesn't burn.

1266
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:50,870
Just like how ghosts can't hurt you.

1267
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:54,970
Bunny garden got a weird update.

1268
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:56,390
This is THE update.

1269
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,690
This is optimal bunnies!

1270
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:00,950
See?

1271
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,290
You see booba so much, you return to monkey.

1272
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:05,770
Yippee!

1273
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:08,830
Knowledge point.

1274
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,000
Return to monkey.

1275
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,840
Monkey, monkey, monkey.

1276
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,000
Monkey, monkey, monkey.

1277
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,220
Monkey, monkey, monkey.

1278
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,800
Monkey, monkey, monkey.

1279
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,120
Oh!

1280
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:28,460
Oh!

1281
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:28,760
Nice.

1282
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,860
Probably should do some more boomerang monkeys.

1283
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,300
Oh wait!

1284
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,100
Um...

1285
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,200
I've been...

1286
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:58,300
Okay, what's the best monkey... what's the best route for the... for the boats because monkey is just a superior bunny.

1287
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,380
Exactly, Road!

1288
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,140
You get it!

1289
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,260
You get it!

1290
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,460
Top route.

1291
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,600
Top path.

1292
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,440
Oh no!

1293
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:11,740
Wait!

1294
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,900
I wanted to get that one too!

1295
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:14,940
It's okay.

1296
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,440
We can at least start upgrading some of these guys.

1297
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,040
I'm feeling insulted by that.

1298
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:26,700
Sorry.

1299
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,020
Actually there's quite a few rabbits in there I think.

1300
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,700
Where's the monkey girl cafe?

1301
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,320
Whoa!

1302
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,120
Why was it stuck?

1303
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:33,220
Haha!

1304
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,200
I'm waiting.

1305
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:39,780
Ooh!

1306
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,360
He's waiting.

1307
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,440
Oh!

1308
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:48,380
Wait!

1309
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:48,680
Wait!

1310
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:48,900
Wait!

1311
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:49,380
Whoa!

1312
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:49,560
Whoa!

1313
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:49,780
Whoa!

1314
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:49,940
Whoa!

1315
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:50,060
Whoa!

1316
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,080
Am I gonna be okay?

1317
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:56,920
Get it!

1318
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,520
Why was it taking you so long?

1319
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,640
Buccaneer is one of the best towers I am on.

1320
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,540
But each path has its uses.

1321
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,760
This is the buccaneer?

1322
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,600
Oh wait.

1323
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:11,540
Oh!

1324
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:13,700
Like...

1325
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:14,880
Oh!

1326
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:15,300
Oh!

1327
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:15,520
Oh!

1328
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,760
I forgot.

1329
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,000
I called just a boat.

1330
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,140
I think we might be okay.

1331
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,600
The camel can only shoot sniper with goggles.

1332
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:38,940
Yeah!

1333
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,160
Yeah!

1334
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:39,480
I know.

1335
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,900
But he had the goggles.

1336
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,320
He just wasn't doing anything.

1337
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:46,880
But it's okay.

1338
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,320
We are good to go.

1339
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,160
Ah!

1340
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,140
It attacks super duper fast!

1341
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:54,720
Um!

1342
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,520
But I really want the extra money!

1343
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:02,260
But it's only one guy.

1344
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,940
Okay, I'll get the destroyer.

1345
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,080
It's only one guy that will be generating the money.

1346
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,360
For now.

1347
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:20,080
I don't know what I have that is stopping the moabs.

1348
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,100
But it's kind of awesome.

1349
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,620
Is it you?

1350
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,000
Um!

1351
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,300
Is anyone going to attack it?

1352
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:28,120
Oh!

1353
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,760
The sniper!

1354
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:31,860
Oh!

1355
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,160
He...

1356
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:32,380
Okay.

1357
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:32,760
Okay.

1358
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:32,960
Okay.

1359
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:34,900
So funny.

1360
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:37,460
Alright.

1361
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,980
What do I do?

1362
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,460
Long range...

1363
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,320
Oh!

1364
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:41,960
Camo balloons!

1365
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,030
Hmm... Middle path on the destroyer.

1366
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:55,650
Well, I was going to do one middle and one bottom.

1367
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,230
So...

1368
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:01,880
Whoa!

1369
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,280
Whoa!

1370
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:05,880
Nice!

1371
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,140
Oh!

1372
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:12,070
Yeah!

1373
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,610
I forgot that I need to do this one too.

1374
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:14,070
Um!

1375
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,530
The frag bombs.

1376
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:18,270
Should...

1377
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:22,050
Should I do a frag or should I do bigger bombs?

1378
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:24,030
Two layers.

1379
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,450
Pop more balloons.

1380
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:27,650
Maybe the bottom.

1381
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,590
That monkey placement just works.

1382
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:35,810
Can't let any balloon go through if all the monkeys at the front start them.

1383
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:36,110
Haha!

1384
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:38,010
Oh!

1385
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,470
Stop though.

1386
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:38,670
Yeah.

1387
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:41,010
Frag.

1388
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:41,410
Yeah.

1389
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:41,970
Yeah.

1390
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:42,330
Yeah.

1391
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:43,570
Nice!

1392
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:47,950
There it is.

1393
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,190
It's coming, you guys.

1394
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,350
Don't worry.

1395
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:51,270
It's going to get you.

1396
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:53,150
Oh!

1397
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:55,530
It'll... It'll show up eventually.

1398
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:56,010
Maybe.

1399
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:59,030
Yippee!

1400
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,430
Alright.

1401
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,310
Let's try and get to level 100.

1402
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:01,650
100.

1403
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,610
I've seen somewhere like the whole...

1404
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:11,690
The whole thing is just DDTs.

1405
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:13,390
And I'm like, how much...

1406
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:15,470
How much crazier can they get?

1407
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,240
I think we'll be okay on the next one even.

1408
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:26,580
I think we'll be okay on the next one even.

1409
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,220
But if not...

1410
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,600
But if not...

1411
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,790
Look at that.

1412
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:34,890
Look at that.

1413
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:35,930
Oh my god.

1414
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,230
Thank you!

1415
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:37,970
Thank you for the rifting gifts!

1416
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,190
Thank you!

1417
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:41,230
Thank you so much!

1418
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,780
Thank you so much!

1419
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:54,500
Thank you!

1420
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:54,720
Thank you!

1421
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,620
Let's see...

1422
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:12,040
I always feel bad when people gifts...

1423
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,560
Like, you know...

1424
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:21,960
I kind of mentioned it when I first started memberships that I kind of priced it lower because my focus is on the podcast.

1425
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,560
And I know the podcast is not forever.

1426
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,560
And once the podcast ends...

1427
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,400
I'll be able to do more membership stuff.

1428
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:30,740
But...

1429
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,980
And I won't change the price.

1430
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:39,260
Oh, we're okay.

1431
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:44,880
Oh, we're okay.

1432
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:50,600
Oh, round 63 is kind of crazy.

1433
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:50,980
Oh!

1434
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,860
Spike turrets can be good on those curves.

1435
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,060
I was just...

1436
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:00,160
I was just thinking about putting this one.

1437
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,900
I do not have...

1438
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,280
Like, you're talking about this thing, right?

1439
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,000
Melted Ice Cures!

1440
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,780
Welcome to the Memphis show!

1441
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,220
Trees...

1442
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:14,040
I know, I do need to plant some.

1443
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:16,020
But I'm trying to find a good place to plant it.

1444
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:17,000
Right there!

1445
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,680
It's perfect, actually.

1446
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,360
Um...

1447
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,980
Let's do...

1448
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,100
Let's just...

1449
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,140
Nice!

1450
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:28,080
Alright, 21...

1451
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,220
Uh...

1452
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,280
Uh...

1453
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:32,760
Yeah...

1454
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,080
32... 14...

1455
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,440
Okay, we can probably get the Elite Defender.

1456
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,960
Oh, my dart monkey is down here!

1457
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:41,820
It's completely...

1458
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,940
Completely nothing!

1459
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,430
We'll just get him too.

1460
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:51,410
Oh!

1461
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:57,390
Nice!

1462
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:00,610
He's helping.

1463
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:01,230
He was!

1464
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,210
He was helping.

1465
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,050
He was.

1466
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:04,830
Stupid shark!

1467
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:09,070
Thank you for the 20!

1468
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:11,190
Yeah, at least...

1469
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:12,150
There's the emote.

1470
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:16,710
If I'm working on anything, I'll try and post little preview stuff.

1471
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:17,290
But...

1472
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:19,610
Um...

1473
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,690
Right now, I have like...

1474
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:23,170
Nothing that is...

1475
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,450
That I can...

1476
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:26,190
Show.

1477
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:31,530
Handle it!

1478
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,210
Handle it!

1479
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,330
Okay, now that we're here...

1480
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,860
Oh my god, it can only cover these four?

1481
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,660
If only... Why can't he go right there?

1482
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,300
Oh...

1483
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:49,580
Why?

1484
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:51,180
Why?

1485
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,060
Why are you so big?

1486
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,060
Village thing.

1487
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,760
Oh, range upgrade!

1488
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,180
You are so right.

1489
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,100
You are so right.

1490
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,200
So bigger...

1491
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,660
Actually, what I do is...

1492
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,480
I do this path.

1493
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,160
But...

1494
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,340
Yeah...

1495
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:17,860
You know what?

1496
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:18,540
I will do this.

1497
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,200
Do I want to do the bureau?

1498
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,100
Intelligence bureau?

1499
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,420
Or do I want to...

1500
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,360
Chat is always right.

1501
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,060
I don't know about that.

1502
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,880
But I already have these one...

1503
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,600
No, never mind.

1504
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,400
I have this one as the bottom.

1505
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,140
Oh, I should have...

1506
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:40,120
I forgot that I was gonna put the thing here.

1507
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,620
I should have done this one as the middle also.

1508
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,400
Oh well, it's okay.

1509
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,500
Chat is kinda mostly sorta right.

1510
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,240
Chat is kinda mostly sorta right.

1511
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,420
Middle path for DDT.

1512
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,100
Middle path for DDT.

1513
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:08,520
This one!

1514
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,720
Let's add another boat, baby.

1515
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:13,640
Let's add another boat, baby.

1516
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,640
We'll put you right here.

1517
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,560
We'll just stack them all up.

1518
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,180
Actually, can I even...

1519
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:22,680
I can't.

1520
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,620
But that's okay.

1521
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,340
Oh wait.

1522
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,140
Maybe the faster shooting up top.

1523
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,640
You and your boatsmen.

1524
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,420
Getting a little crowded in there.

1525
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,180
Not that!

1526
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,320
The monkey village.

1527
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,320
Oh my god, Samson, stop yelling at me!

1528
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,330
Oh, this one for DDT.

1529
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:57,790
Oops.

1530
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:58,750
No, you're okay.

1531
01:14:58,890 --> 01:14:59,510
I'm kidding.

1532
01:14:59,630 --> 01:14:59,910
I'm kidding.

1533
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:00,370
Don't worry.

1534
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:03,150
Everyone yell at her.

1535
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:04,810
No, stop yelling at me!

1536
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:06,770
I'm sensitive today, you guys.

1537
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:07,410
I'm sensitive.

1538
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:19,900
This is like a classic example of miscommunication.

1539
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,980
Here I was like, Okay, another boat!

1540
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,020
I was just like, Okay!

1541
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:34,710
Oh, sorry.

1542
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:36,090
I clicked out of the video.

1543
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,530
The game.

1544
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:41,770
DDT is 90+.

1545
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:42,590
Are you sure?

1546
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:45,730
I'm pretty sure there's at least one before, right?

1547
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:47,850
Did I miss bunny garden?

1548
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:48,490
I'm confused.

1549
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,390
I'm sorry, Blake.

1550
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:53,770
I switched bunny garden today to balloons because I didn't...

1551
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,190
I wasn't...

1552
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:57,770
I was only thinking of balloons.

1553
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:58,910
Oh.

1554
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:09,010
But this one allows more range and pierce and projectile speed.

1555
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,970
It just seems like the whammy.

1556
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:15,350
But what I can do is I can put another one here.

1557
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:20,250
I can put another one here.

1558
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:24,050
We'll go with this one.

1559
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:25,610
We'll go with the bureau.

1560
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:33,230
Big brain.

1561
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:34,250
I know.

1562
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,590
And then it can affect any monkeys down here.

1563
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:42,310
Bigger radius.

1564
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:44,750
Okay.

1565
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:48,230
Handle it!

1566
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:49,410
Handle it!

1567
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:50,490
Oh my god, handle it!

1568
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,750
Are balloons the weapon to surpass Metal Gear?

1569
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:58,330
Nah, I ain't afraid of no balloons.

1570
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:02,910
I ain't afraid of no balloons.

1571
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:18,370
Oh wait, I was meant to do this one.

1572
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:23,540
Bust.

1573
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,420
If you want a really good DDT, unlock preemptive strike on the sub.

1574
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:33,180
Have it see camo with a village and you're good to go.

1575
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:33,580
Ah!

1576
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:34,960
Thanks, Ben.

1577
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:35,500
I'm gonna try.

1578
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:39,480
I actually, I don't think I've unlocked anything on the sub, so...

1579
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,860
Oh no, that's untrue.

1580
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:43,900
That's untrue.

1581
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,240
I've unlocked some stuff.

1582
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,260
Wait, so pre... what was it?

1583
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,520
Oh, preemptive strike.

1584
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:49,900
Oof.

1585
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:50,940
We're pretty far from that.

1586
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:51,360
But...

1587
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,280
Plant it near the village.

1588
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,180
Here.

1589
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,460
I'm gonna do two of them.

1590
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:11,560
Okay.

1591
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,630
I can't upgrade it just yet, but...

1592
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,270
Middle path is crazy strong.

1593
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:20,730
Is it?

1594
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:21,010
Okay.

1595
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:23,830
This is why I have you guys here!

1596
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:25,730
Thanks, guys!

1597
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:39,510
I don't really need that there, but whatever.

1598
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:41,250
Um...

1599
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:41,770
Okay.

1600
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:43,250
Okay.

1601
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:45,870
600.

1602
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:46,270
Ooh.

1603
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:47,710
It might be tough.

1604
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,510
I'm not gonna lie.

1605
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:51,190
It might be tough to get this before...

1606
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:57,710
Is it loud?

1607
01:18:57,970 --> 01:18:58,270
Let me...

1608
01:18:58,270 --> 01:18:58,990
Be honest with me.

1609
01:18:59,070 --> 01:18:59,490
Is it loud?

1610
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:02,850
Top path for a bow is really good.

1611
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:03,630
We're working on it!

1612
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:04,350
We're working on it.

1613
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:08,700
It's fine?

1614
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:11,620
Okay.

1615
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:12,980
Thank you, guys.

1616
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:20,400
You guys are so cute.

1617
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,700
You guys are so cute.

1618
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:26,240
Sweet.

1619
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:27,920
Sweet.

1620
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,300
Okay.

1621
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,760
Make it louder.

1622
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,020
Hopefully, we get... Let's see.

1623
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,320
We're only at 3000.

1624
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,160
But that's okay.

1625
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,440
We're working on it.

1626
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,000
We're working on it.

1627
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,740
Even if we don't have it for this...

1628
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,940
For this one, we can have it for future stuff, right?

1629
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:49,680
Louder!

1630
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:54,870
Nice.

1631
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,150
I'm gonna try and get, um...

1632
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,970
This monkey to the crossbow master.

1633
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:12,890
Gonna try and get him to crossbow...

1634
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:13,270
Oh, wait!

1635
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:14,250
I forgot I...

1636
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,110
I added this guy.

1637
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:18,990
Wait.

1638
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:25,180
Where did he go?

1639
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:27,740
Wait.

1640
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,740
Where's the monkey that just...

1641
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,340
Oh!

1642
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,390
My bananas were gonna go rotten!

1643
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:46,770
Oh!

1644
01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:46,870
My bananas were gonna go rotten!

1645
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:51,710
Or... Oh, wait.

1646
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,290
I think actually I should go for...

1647
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:54,810
The elite defender.

1648
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,490
I think.

1649
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:56,870
Probably.

1650
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,030
Go!

1651
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:04,010
Go!

1652
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:04,730
Go!

1653
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:04,950
Go!

1654
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:05,310
Go!

1655
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:06,010
Go!

1656
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:06,090
Go!

1657
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,880
Feel nature's wrath.

1658
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,320
Okay, 75.

1659
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,460
Bananas have gone bad.

1660
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:21,240
No, they're still good.

1661
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,640
They're just a little brown.

1662
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,280
Nothing wrong with that.

1663
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:25,780
Whoa!

1664
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,590
That was so close, right?

1665
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:32,870
Woof!

1666
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:33,750
Easy peasy.

1667
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:37,710
She's gonna die.

1668
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:39,390
What'd you say, gamer random?

1669
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:39,830
Huh?

1670
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:41,050
What'd you say?

1671
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:41,370
Huh?

1672
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:42,890
What'd you say?

1673
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:43,890
I was gonna die?

1674
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:44,210
Huh?

1675
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:54,970
What'd you say?

1676
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:54,970
I was gonna die?

1677
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:54,970
Huh?

1678
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:55,230
What'd you say?

1679
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:55,230
I was gonna die?

1680
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:55,230
Huh?

1681
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:55,770
I think...

1682
01:21:56,890 --> 01:21:59,270
No, I know that I always...

1683
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,510
No, I know that I always...

1684
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,270
Usually die at 93.

1685
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:02,730
No, I know that I always...

1686
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:03,730
Usually die at 93.

1687
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:06,350
No, unbeliever.

1688
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,670
I wish though I could upgrade these guys.

1689
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:11,070
I wish though I could upgrade these guys.

1690
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:12,990
Twin gun.

1691
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:14,250
Actually...

1692
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:18,090
Long range targeting...

1693
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:22,130
Wait, which one of...

1694
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:22,530
Wait, which one of...

1695
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:24,310
Oh no, yeah, I'm going for the middle.

1696
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:25,070
Oh no, yeah, I'm going for the middle.

1697
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:26,470
Hmm...

1698
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:35,070
What's the bottom path?

1699
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:37,470
Oh, double attack speed.

1700
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,790
Enhances attack speed of other weapons.

1701
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:40,710
Enhances attack speed of other weapons.

1702
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,320
Intel for subs is huge?

1703
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,300
Okay, well I have that unlocked, so...

1704
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,880
I figure it's probably better to...

1705
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:50,080
I figure it's probably better to...

1706
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,600
Oh wait, I didn't get this one.

1707
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,840
Oh my gosh, my bad.

1708
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:57,250
Oops, too many boats and stuff here.

1709
01:22:58,760 --> 01:22:59,340
Oops, too many boats and stuff here.

1710
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,580
I have too many boats.

1711
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,080
Can't see everything.

1712
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:03,560
Can't see anything.

1713
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,560
Well guys, this might be it.

1714
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:10,920
This might be it.

1715
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,100
If it is...

1716
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,800
I guess we'll see.

1717
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:22,810
Add another dart monkey.

1718
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:27,820
Add another dart monkey.

1719
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:28,280
Dart monkey!

1720
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:28,900
Yeah!

1721
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,140
Maybe I can spike bolt him.

1722
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:41,480
Spike...

1723
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:43,840
Spike bolt my monkey.

1724
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,680
We'll make him faster.

1725
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:49,640
Because he's slow.

1726
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,240
Go monkey, go!

1727
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,460
We'll just do a couple of those.

1728
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,760
We're still alive, baby!

1729
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,380
We're still alive, baby!

1730
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:20,800
We're still alive, baby!

1731
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,280
It helps that we have a bunch of guys that are able to...

1732
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:41,760
It helps that we have a bunch of guys that are able to...

1733
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,040
see camo balloons.

1734
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:46,560
Triumphant!

1735
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,620
If you set the target of the spike path to the last, you will throw all the way down the path.

1736
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,100
That is a great idea.

1737
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,840
That is actually a really good idea.

1738
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,220
Yes, yes, yes!

1739
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:01,800
Yes,

1740
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:05,600
yes, yes!

1741
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,680
But you're already dead.

1742
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,440
You're so right!

1743
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,140
I'm such a...

1744
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:14,880
I'm such a hypocrite saying that we're alive, aren't I?

1745
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:15,800
I'm such a hypocrite saying that we're alive, aren't I?

1746
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,640
I mean, you guys are alive.

1747
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:17,680
I'm the dead one.

1748
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:23,550
You know, just ghost things.

1749
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:23,730
Ghost things.

1750
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,160
I think I can make the next one.

1751
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:36,160
I might regret saying that, but...

1752
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,240
Holy cow!

1753
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,880
Holy moly!

1754
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:42,580
Rise!

1755
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,100
Oh my god!

1756
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:47,740
Yow!

1757
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,100
Look at the fetish of the IQ!

1758
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:58,220
Rise!

1759
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:02,280
Wow!

1760
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,920
Couldn't even get to the trees!

1761
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,260
Easy peasy.

1762
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:16,940
Just like that.

1763
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:22,200
I am going to add a helicopter monkey in here though.

1764
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:25,160
And I'm going to...

1765
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,000
I want to buy a village.

1766
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:28,440
Oops!

1767
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:29,240
Where did he go?

1768
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,400
But I don't think I can...

1769
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,320
Hmm...

1770
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,180
Village for the snipers.

1771
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,180
That is true too.

1772
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,080
Down here.

1773
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,140
I'm going to put it here.

1774
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,080
Okay, so here's the plan.

1775
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:02,560
Put one here, so when I fill out this area...

1776
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,440
It reaches with the range.

1777
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,700
And then we can have one down here.

1778
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,260
That will help any monkeys over here.

1779
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,480
So we'll just kind of put this one...

1780
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,240
Right on the edge!

1781
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,040
Right on the edge!

1782
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:16,280
Right on the edge!

1783
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,100
Right there.

1784
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:18,640
And...

1785
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,620
Should we do it?

1786
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,400
Well, we have this one.

1787
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:29,880
Oh wait!

1788
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,440
Oh my gosh!

1789
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:33,340
I have this one.

1790
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:34,180
That's the...

1791
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:36,380
Oh, this one!

1792
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:36,860
Yeah!

1793
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,020
I was going to do that earlier!

1794
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:38,840
I completely forgot!

1795
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:39,980
Oh my gosh!

1796
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:40,360
Keith!

1797
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,440
Thanks for the five gifted!

1798
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,320
Money, money!

1799
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:46,380
Middle path village for camo and...

1800
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:47,820
Yeah, you're right.

1801
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:49,920
You're right.

1802
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,380
And we can do the bigger radius.

1803
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,820
Oops, no jungle.

1804
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,260
There we go.

1805
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,200
Oh, the Z-O-M-G!

1806
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,780
Z-O-M-G!

1807
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:01,960
Z-O-M-G!

1808
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:02,960
Sorry, I'm American.

1809
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,820
Z-O-M-G!

1810
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:08,500
Z-O-M-G!

1811
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,820
Z-O-M-G!

1812
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:11,960
Oh my gosh, so easy.

1813
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:15,340
Oh my

1814
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:20,350
gosh, so easy.

1815
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:21,550
Snipers already see camo.

1816
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:22,770
I think...

1817
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:24,330
This one does not.

1818
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:26,710
This one...

1819
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:27,950
This guy doesn't.

1820
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:29,290
Now he does because of here.

1821
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:32,270
This guy did, so it was kind of like whatever.

1822
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:36,150
But this guy who's super fast did not, so it's okay.

1823
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:38,370
Umm...

1824
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:40,290
I think this guy also already did.

1825
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:41,530
Oh yeah, he did.

1826
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:42,150
But that's okay!

1827
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:46,970
It's okay, we're going to have monkeys down here that aren't able to see camo.

1828
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:47,430
So it's okay.

1829
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:50,410
Do you think we'll ever do a few games with the wisps?

1830
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:53,210
We can even make a team clan and have weekly challenges.

1831
01:28:53,890 --> 01:28:54,290
Like...

1832
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:55,850
Like this game?

1833
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:57,950
Like bloons game?

1834
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:07,010
Can you make teams in bloons?

1835
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:08,090
Is there multi...

1836
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:09,550
This game has a clan system.

1837
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:10,050
Really?

1838
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:14,850
Oh then hell yeah!

1839
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:16,350
Let's do it!

1840
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,520
Co-op bloons!

1841
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:37,080
Can you imagine if like two people are trying to play bloons at the same time and I like put something down and like whoever I'm playing with immediately sells it and is just like STOP IT!

1842
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:46,180
They sell it and like put another thing in its place trying to optimize the map and I'm just like la la la Oh!

1843
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,950
I shouldn't have...

1844
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:57,950
I didn't realize it was still there.

1845
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:05,230
Go monkeys go!

1846
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:09,350
Go monkeys go!

1847
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:11,130
Crazy!

1848
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,050
Have you done a boss battle yet?

1849
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:14,910
In bloons?

1850
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,530
I have not.

1851
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:18,590
I am going to put this one here.

1852
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:27,220
I actually have not used the spike factory at all.

1853
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,840
And so I do want to trade it a little bit if I can.

1854
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:33,360
Um, magic monkey.

1855
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:34,620
I also want to...

1856
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,260
I barely used him.

1857
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,860
Um, I want to get the necromancer.

1858
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,180
The necromancer route.

1859
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,800
So we are going to put him like right here.

1860
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:52,880
He is just kind of like a random monkey but he can start summoning or should I put him down here?

1861
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,420
For like extra defense down here.

1862
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,640
Fire wizard is cracked.

1863
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:04,920
I usually pick fire wizard but it was Matara who was just like I love necromancer monkey so I kind of wanted to use it.

1864
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:14,150
Spike 100 killer with middle path.

1865
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:14,590
Okay.

1866
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:15,810
We will focus on the middle path.

1867
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:17,110
What is this one anyway?

1868
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:18,610
Oh, the spike storm.

1869
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:19,650
Oh, it's crazy.

1870
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:20,150
It is.

1871
01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:20,450
It is.

1872
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:22,950
Necro is more cracked.

1873
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:25,750
I only remember playing balloons during school.

1874
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:27,950
What's the current lore on why these monkeys hate balloons?

1875
01:31:28,230 --> 01:31:29,490
I don't... Is there a lore?

1876
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:30,350
I have no idea.

1877
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:33,090
Back end defense.

1878
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:33,570
Yeah.

1879
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,190
That's what I was thinking.

1880
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:35,950
And we get the help of the...

1881
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:43,990
of the... I do want him to be able to like fight more so that he can get more experience but it's okay.

1882
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,070
Oh, he's fighting!

1883
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:49,550
He's fighting!

1884
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:50,090
Look at him go!

1885
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:51,730
Go monkey!

1886
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:52,070
Go!

1887
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:56,030
Little monkey!

1888
01:31:57,490 --> 01:31:58,990
Thanks to the Super Chatrix!

1889
01:31:59,190 --> 01:31:59,510
Thanks to the Super Chatrix!

1890
01:31:59,510 --> 01:31:59,590
Thank you!

1891
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:01,470
Ow!

1892
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:04,130
It's okay.

1893
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:05,550
It's okay.

1894
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:07,450
Nature prevails.

1895
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:10,430
Nature prevails.

1896
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:11,090
Nature prevails.

1897
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:14,350
I'm wondering if I should have a glue monkey.

1898
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:17,770
Sticky monkey.

1899
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:20,130
Hmm...

1900
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,510
Just slow down anybody.

1901
01:32:27,670 --> 01:32:29,290
Bottom path for sticky monkey.

1902
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:37,530
Balloon solver is crazy.

1903
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,050
Balloon's a problem?

1904
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:39,970
Here's the solution.

1905
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:41,770
I can't unlock it yet though.

1906
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:45,570
I'm close to the super glue.

1907
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:53,080
Bottom path is good late game.

1908
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:54,220
Hmm...

1909
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:55,980
Let's get a glue monkey.

1910
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:56,880
We'll get him...

1911
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,100
We'll put him kind of close to the front so we can start slowing people down.

1912
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,240
I'm just gonna put him right on top of there.

1913
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,020
And we're gonna give him...

1914
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:12,540
We're gonna do the bottom path for you.

1915
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,120
I usually do bottom path and then two up top.

1916
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,340
0-2-5 glue is good especially since you have camo.

1917
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,400
Like this one.

1918
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:24,840
Okay.

1919
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,300
0-2-5.

1920
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:27,700
Okay.

1921
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,380
Start slowing those bloons down.

1922
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:55,200
I feel like that already made a ton of difference.

1923
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:56,260
Holy cow.

1924
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:01,160
I feel like that already made a ton of difference.

1925
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:02,600
Oh wait.

1926
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:04,980
Maybe I should've... You know what?

1927
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:05,120
Whatever.

1928
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,180
Are you doing anything?

1929
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:14,760
Are you working?

1930
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:15,780
It's 22.

1931
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,040
Yeah!

1932
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:23,750
Surprise!

1933
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,290
Can you like do something though?

1934
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:30,170
Upgrade some towers.

1935
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:33,210
I think for the most part I've upgraded anything that I can.

1936
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:35,010
Unless I'm...

1937
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:37,910
No, we're doing middle path here.

1938
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:42,270
Why is the sub taking so long to unlock anything?

1939
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:47,070
Like the sub is taking so long to get any experience.

1940
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:49,470
But they're killing a...

1941
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:51,110
Look at the... Oh wait that's the boat.

1942
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:54,270
What's the name of the monkey on the bottom right?

1943
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:55,150
Is that a new monkey?

1944
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:57,010
I haven't played bloons in a while.

1945
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:03,110
Less XP passed post stage 60.

1946
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:03,950
Oh...

1947
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:09,290
I didn't realize... Oh I think actually I was told that before and I just completely forgot.

1948
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:12,250
I'm gonna place a helicopter down here.

1949
01:35:13,930 --> 01:35:14,370
Um...

1950
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:19,190
This might be not the best placement right here.

1951
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:23,090
But it's also kind of hard to place on this map and I want him cause...

1952
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:27,550
Oh wait but he'll also get to attack any type of bloon.

1953
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:30,730
So...

1954
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:34,270
Can you destroy the house?

1955
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:35,230
You can't.

1956
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:36,070
Oh!

1957
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:42,460
Tickle tickle.

1958
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,440
Tickle tickle.

1959
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,220
Oh he's good can move it wherever.

1960
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,280
Yeah so usually what I do with the helicopter is I do...

1961
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:56,100
Um... I do 2, 5.

1962
01:35:58,500 --> 01:35:59,100
But...

1963
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:07,310
No I'm sorry.

1964
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:09,390
The 2 up here.

1965
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:12,230
Wait...

1966
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:16,430
I do 2, 0, 5.

1967
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:17,250
Well 4.

1968
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:18,350
In my case.

1969
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:19,170
But...

1970
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,350
2, 0, 5 is fine.

1971
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:23,370
Even if I...

1972
01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:26,390
So... But if I put it here I'll be able to...

1973
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:30,910
To... Um... Actually I might be able to put it right here.

1974
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:33,290
Oh come on.

1975
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:34,370
There is space there.

1976
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:36,150
Maybe down here then.

1977
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:38,870
Over here.

1978
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:41,210
On the rock.

1979
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:44,050
Maybe right here then.

1980
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:46,510
Ah...

1981
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:49,310
Put it next to the snipers.

1982
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:49,870
Okay yeah.

1983
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:54,050
I think... I think it'd be best to have the power up from the...

1984
01:36:56,430 --> 01:36:56,870
2...

1985
01:36:58,530 --> 01:36:58,970
5.

1986
01:36:59,210 --> 01:36:59,410
Okay.

1987
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:02,330
Yeah!

1988
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:07,050
Handle it!

1989
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:13,700
Batara!

1990
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:17,460
Handle it!

1991
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:23,040
What the heck!

1992
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,300
So easy!

1993
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:31,200
Handle it!

1994
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:33,620
Go monkeys!

1995
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:34,060
Go!

1996
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:40,320
We don't have the DDTs yet.

1997
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:41,060
So...

1998
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:51,310
Oh my gosh!

1999
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:54,210
I'm watching from bed.

2000
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:56,410
You better be doing the stuff that...

2001
01:37:56,410 --> 01:37:58,170
You were supposed to be doing missy.

2002
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:00,510
You better be doing that stuff.

2003
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,340
She's developing a new meta.

2004
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,580
You'd be homeless if you had...

2005
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:10,900
Wait.

2006
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,700
If this had an MGS collab transaction.

2007
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:21,930
Why are you gonna say it like that?

2008
01:38:24,010 --> 01:38:25,930
I wouldn't... I didn't...

2009
01:38:25,930 --> 01:38:29,570
I didn't become homeless when Fortnite had Metal Gear, huh?

2010
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:31,190
So...

2011
01:38:32,350 --> 01:38:33,910
I think I'm pretty good.

2012
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:35,770
I think I'm okay.

2013
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:40,610
I think I can handle myself.

2014
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:43,410
As... as...

2015
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:45,510
OBGYN would say.

2016
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:46,450
Handle it!

2017
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:59,000
Holy cow!

2018
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:00,160
Oh

2019
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:04,040
my god!

2020
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:05,760
Our monkeys!

2021
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:09,260
Oh no.

2022
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:09,840
I was like...

2023
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:10,360
Oh good!

2024
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:10,860
We have enough!

2025
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:11,160
No.

2026
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,080
I need the top.

2027
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:12,660
Oh my gosh!

2028
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,180
I need so much more for the top!

2029
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:16,340
Oh!

2030
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:24,820
It's like... really tempting to purchase the other upgrades when you see that they're green and all.

2031
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:25,380
I mean...

2032
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,220
Like this one.

2033
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,180
Oh!

2034
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:29,120
Oh!

2035
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:29,940
Oh!

2036
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,000
Heat tips...

2037
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:36,700
Heat tips...

2038
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:38,880
Okay.

2039
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:40,080
We're gonna upload...

2040
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:40,480
Upload?

2041
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:43,080
We're gonna upgrade the MOAB Eliminator next.

2042
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,200
What would the adjective for a monkey be?

2043
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,180
Like Psycho Mantis or Sniper Wolf?

2044
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:53,360
Monkey Monkey.

2045
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,280
Wizard?

2046
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:58,400
Where's my wizard?

2047
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,440
It's so hard to see where anybody is.

2048
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:04,880
He's also pretty...

2049
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:05,560
Oh wait.

2050
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:05,760
No.

2051
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:06,040
Wizard.

2052
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:06,560
Oh!

2053
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:06,800
Him!

2054
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:07,640
No.

2055
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:08,600
He's like got nothing.

2056
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,140
My wizard's got nothing.

2057
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:14,480
He's so small.

2058
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:21,560
Manic Monkey.

2059
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:22,940
Actually that sounds...

2060
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:25,700
That actually sounds like it could be real.

2061
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:27,080
Manic Monkey.

2062
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:31,740
Who's that monkey?

2063
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,360
Monkey Monkey.

2064
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:35,700
Who's that monkey?

2065
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,040
Monkey Monkey.

2066
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:38,520
Monkey Monkey.

2067
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,240
Oh wait.

2068
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:40,960
Or maybe...

2069
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,980
Maybe I should do the Sniper Monkey.

2070
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:50,080
Maybe I should make my Sniper Monkey instead of you.

2071
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:57,920
MOABs are immobilized for longer and take extra damage from all the other attacks.

2072
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:00,980
You can name your monkeys with them.

2073
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:01,860
A.K.A.

2074
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:02,580
Sniper Wolf.

2075
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:03,100
I can?

2076
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,500
No I can't.

2077
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:07,320
No I

2078
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:16,900
can't.

2079
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,260
Change Sniper to Strong.

2080
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,340
I usually do.

2081
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:20,880
Thank you.

2082
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:22,860
I usually do.

2083
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:23,500
Thank you.

2084
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:26,580
Handle it!

2085
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,140
Oh they're fast.

2086
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,840
Oh they're fast and they're furious.

2087
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,740
They're fast and they're furious.

2088
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:44,220
Nature prevails everybody.

2089
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,340
You need to buy the ability to name them from the shop.

2090
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:48,800
Really?

2091
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:49,380
That's crazy.

2092
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:54,080
I'm coming up on the faded round soon.

2093
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:56,760
We're getting close to DDTs.

2094
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,380
I know.

2095
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:57,860
I know.

2096
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:58,240
I'm scared.

2097
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,800
First DDT check.

2098
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:01,540
Oh gosh.

2099
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:04,380
That's why I'm thinking I should...

2100
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:13,380
Massive damage to MOABs and assassinate ability deals 6x damage with a short cooldown.

2101
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:29,040
Take extra damage from all the other attacks.

2102
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:31,500
I think I'm going to save up for the Sniper Monkey.

2103
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:35,360
Okay.

2104
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:37,360
Handle it!

2105
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:40,660
No way!

2106
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:49,780
Thank you.

2107
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,520
I always forget.

2108
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,440
I do usually change these but I think I'm going to I think I'm just silly because I...

2109
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,220
Because, you know.

2110
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:02,900
Just silly things.

2111
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:06,880
I must resist!

2112
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:39,730
That was...

2113
01:43:39,730 --> 01:43:41,750
That was not so great.

2114
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:44,830
That was not so great.

2115
01:43:45,170 --> 01:43:46,790
That was a little rough.

2116
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:47,330
I think.

2117
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:49,690
That was a little rough.

2118
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:50,030
No!

2119
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:50,750
Don't leave!

2120
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:53,370
No!

2121
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:54,470
But...

2122
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:59,990
Big Sniper Monkey.

2123
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:04,090
Big Sniper Monkey.

2124
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:12,800
He's slow though.

2125
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,100
I wonder if it's okay.

2126
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,240
But he's so slow.

2127
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:17,920
Handle it!

2128
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:19,240
ZOMG!

2129
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:25,680
Rise!

2130
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:32,030
It's the next round that I'm really worried about, you guys.

2131
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:34,090
Uh oh.

2132
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:34,510
Wait.

2133
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:35,190
Oh no.

2134
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:35,690
Oh no.

2135
01:44:35,730 --> 01:44:36,310
We're about to lose.

2136
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:36,670
Okay.

2137
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:39,490
It's the next round that I'm worried about.

2138
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:41,970
Hmm...

2139
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:46,150
I don't think I have so much money that I can like...

2140
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:52,770
Also, I should just start unlocking these because I have nothing else to unlock here.

2141
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:55,210
The Dreaded 93.

2142
01:44:59,090 --> 01:44:59,570
Okay.

2143
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:02,050
Both snipers target strong, so we're okay.

2144
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:04,110
Pursuit...

2145
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:07,890
Spike Factory is just down here doing his thing.

2146
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:10,750
Oh...

2147
01:45:11,410 --> 01:45:11,890
Gosh...

2148
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:14,610
You got this unironically?

2149
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:15,510
You think so?

2150
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:16,010
Okay.

2151
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:18,910
I just always die at 93, so...

2152
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:19,670
We'll see.

2153
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:21,290
DDT!

2154
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:22,370
EFT!

2155
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:22,730
Oh!

2156
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:23,670
Handle it!

2157
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:24,890
Okay.

2158
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:36,550
Oh my god!

2159
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:40,270
Let's go!

2160
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:44,450
Wow!

2161
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:48,270
Let's go!

2162
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:49,870
Easy.

2163
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:51,210
Easy peasy.

2164
01:45:53,150 --> 01:45:54,950
I love balloons!

2165
01:45:57,090 --> 01:45:58,350
Oh my gosh.

2166
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:00,770
Is there anything else we should add in?

2167
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:01,590
I was thinking...

2168
01:46:03,630 --> 01:46:04,430
No!

2169
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:08,920
We're close.

2170
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:09,240
We're close.

2171
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:10,400
Um...

2172
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:14,260
Um... No!

2173
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,440
We'll save up.

2174
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:16,880
We'll save up.

2175
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:19,520
Um...

2176
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,300
Hmm... I'm trying to...

2177
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:22,800
Um...

2178
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,880
That was a good place for Gatlin Monkey.

2179
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:26,980
Hmm...

2180
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:28,420
Add a glue monkey?

2181
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:29,880
Okay.

2182
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:31,500
If you guys think I need another glue...

2183
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,380
Where is he?

2184
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:34,100
Oh, glue monkey.

2185
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:36,020
Like right here.

2186
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,500
Right next to other glue monkey.

2187
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:40,280
Um...

2188
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,840
Should I just do the same?

2189
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,360
Well, this one...

2190
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:46,280
Maybe I do the corrosive on this one, right?

2191
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,940
Or should I just do the same route?

2192
01:46:53,710 --> 01:46:54,990
You can make that one aggressive.

2193
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:56,630
With the balloon liquefier.

2194
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:01,490
Alchemist's buff...

2195
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:04,310
Alchemist's buff...

2196
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:04,710
Alchemist's buff...

2197
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:05,510
Alchemist's buff snipers?

2198
01:47:08,450 --> 01:47:08,890
Alchemist's buff snipers?

2199
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:09,570
Alchemist's buff snipers?

2200
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:10,930
Glue does not stack with other glues.

2201
01:47:11,110 --> 01:47:12,130
It doesn't?

2202
01:47:12,490 --> 01:47:14,990
But maybe then we do the corrosive.

2203
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:17,250
So if he gets... If he slows them down...

2204
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:18,010
He starts...

2205
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:21,210
So we'll do the corrosive.

2206
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:23,790
Um...

2207
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:25,330
Then we'll do more.

2208
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:26,930
He gets more of them.

2209
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:28,830
Alchemists are really good.

2210
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:29,510
Oh, shoot.

2211
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:29,950
Okay.

2212
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:30,630
I'm gonna...

2213
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:33,510
Alchemist monkey down here.

2214
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,270
This is the alchemist, right?

2215
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:37,730
Am I on... Oh, yeah.

2216
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:37,930
Yeah.

2217
01:47:37,970 --> 01:47:38,170
Okay.

2218
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:41,910
Right there, baby.

2219
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:45,730
How does he buff them?

2220
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:52,230
Powerful monster.

2221
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:53,570
Top path.

2222
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:56,410
Louse...

2223
01:47:56,410 --> 01:47:58,570
Oh, throws a helpful potion that nearby monkeys...

2224
01:47:58,570 --> 01:48:01,090
Pop lead balloons and do extra damage to ceramic...

2225
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:01,490
Oh!

2226
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:05,530
Throws special brew to nearby monkeys...

2227
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:06,930
Giving them extra damage range...

2228
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:07,990
Well, range, whatever.

2229
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:09,870
Because it's, you know, snipers, but...

2230
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,120
Hmm...

2231
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:17,840
Okay.

2232
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,220
Let's try it.

2233
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:31,780
And then maybe the pool.

2234
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:33,660
For, like, extra damage down here.

2235
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,540
Top alch is mega OP.

2236
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:37,720
Really?

2237
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:39,720
Oh...

2238
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,380
We can try another round.

2239
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:41,780
Yeah!

2240
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:44,300
Pool is useless?

2241
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:44,620
Really?

2242
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:45,260
Okay.

2243
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:46,800
I'm trusting you guys.

2244
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:53,480
I'm, like, trying not to rely on you guys too much, but also take your advice.

2245
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:00,140
I don't want to seem like I'm just, uh...

2246
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:03,020
I don't want to seem like I'm just, uh...

2247
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:03,120
Ah!

2248
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:04,720
Oh my god.

2249
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:07,040
Holy cow!

2250
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:09,540
It's okay.

2251
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:10,520
Maybe.

2252
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,320
Oh, maybe it's not okay.

2253
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:12,960
Oh, no!

2254
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:13,540
No, it's okay!

2255
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,640
Yeah, I don't think the MOAB glue is working!

2256
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:20,840
Uh-oh.

2257
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:24,700
I think...

2258
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:28,860
That was close.

2259
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,300
That was close.

2260
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:35,140
That was close.

2261
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:35,220
That was close.

2262
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:37,300
The glue liquefied is overriding the MOAB glue.

2263
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:38,040
The glue liquefied is overriding the MOAB glue.

2264
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:38,080
Yeah.

2265
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,020
Uh-oh.

2266
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:40,380
Uh-oh.

2267
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,040
I think I just wasted a bunch of money.

2268
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,340
Wait, what's going on here?

2269
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:48,520
Why is it bubbly?

2270
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:52,460
Why is it bubbling like that?

2271
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:55,960
Oh, because he gave me a potion!

2272
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:56,260
Oh, because he gave me a potion!

2273
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:56,720
That's so cute!

2274
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:02,220
Sell useless stuff?

2275
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:04,420
Oh, no one's useless to me.

2276
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:07,940
I wish I could move them instead of just selling them, you know?

2277
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:15,920
I wish I could move them instead of just selling them, you know?

2278
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:16,640
Okay, goodbye.

2279
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:19,440
Goodbye, balloon liquefier.

2280
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:24,560
Goodbye, balloon liquefier.

2281
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:25,660
Sorry, I shouldn't have put you there.

2282
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:27,480
I shouldn't have put you there!

2283
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:31,260
Oh,

2284
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,780
that scratch is a good itch.

2285
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,780
Oh, this one I can unlock!

2286
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:45,940
Should I...

2287
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:48,980
Wait, I might just be able to put that on him.

2288
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,000
Wait, what does this do, actually?

2289
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,980
Glue so strong it temporarily immobilizes all affected blooms.

2290
01:50:53,180 --> 01:50:53,900
Oh, let's go!

2291
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:54,920
You know what?

2292
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:55,900
Let's just get it.

2293
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,060
How much is it?

2294
01:50:59,080 --> 01:50:59,480
How much is it?

2295
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:00,100
24 ,000!

2296
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,100
We can do it.

2297
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,120
Live!

2298
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:06,760
Live!

2299
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:08,440
Live!

2300
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,220
Live!

2301
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:12,040
Oh,

2302
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:21,320
my God!

2303
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:22,080
Oh, my God!

2304
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:31,950
Oh, my bananas!

2305
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:36,390
My

2306
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:43,880
God!

2307
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:47,580
You said not even close, but to me, that was pretty close!

2308
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:55,040
That felt pretty close to me.

2309
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,640
I love... I love...

2310
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:08,180
Heli... Heli monkey is so good.

2311
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:09,160
Heli monkey is awesome.

2312
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:11,420
What is this one?

2313
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:14,680
Upgraded weapons also automatically cause three more monkeys.

2314
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:15,920
Permanently!

2315
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:17,760
98 is scary?

2316
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:18,260
Okay.

2317
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:21,760
97...

2318
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:24,660
Everything above 90 is a pain, apparently.

2319
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:30,940
Here's the second VTuber I've seen excitedly shout, I love bloons!

2320
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,260
Thanks, Rico!

2321
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:35,460
Don't know to test...

2322
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:37,760
Don't know to test to say minto estinco on Fridays.

2323
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:39,480
I don't know why I can't hear...

2324
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,080
I mean, the game is kind of loud, but...

2325
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:43,140
Butt was not clenched.

2326
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,740
My butt was kind of clenched.

2327
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:47,180
I don't know why I can't... why I'm not hearing the streamlabs.

2328
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:48,600
But I am reading them, so...

2329
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:50,920
Lampy!

2330
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,460
Welcome to Mambusha Bank!

2331
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:54,860
Thank you so much!

2332
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,320
One tier 5 to survive round 100.

2333
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:01,840
I have two!

2334
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:03,420
Well, tier 5 what?

2335
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:05,740
There's no notice.

2336
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:06,620
At all?

2337
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:15,480
None at all.

2338
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:20,000
That's weird.

2339
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:25,420
That's very strange.

2340
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:31,120
How long is the wait for a party at one of your cafes?

2341
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:33,100
Um, don't worry about it.

2342
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:39,890
Orange sniper.

2343
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:41,050
This guy?

2344
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:41,850
On first?

2345
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:46,670
I think he might actually need to be first because he's so fast.

2346
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:49,470
And if people are down here you need to like go for them, you know?

2347
01:53:49,690 --> 01:53:50,090
Oh!

2348
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:52,690
This one we can now pay for, right?

2349
01:53:52,770 --> 01:53:55,430
We went for the... we're going for this one, right?

2350
01:53:56,490 --> 01:53:56,890
Yeah.

2351
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:04,000
This is a test of the emergency super chat system.

2352
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,960
It's not super chats with the issue.

2353
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:06,440
Hmm.

2354
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:08,520
What kind of a game is this?

2355
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:09,780
It's a tower defense game.

2356
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:16,230
Drums!

2357
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:18,870
Oh my gosh, thank you!

2358
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:19,990
Holy cow!

2359
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:23,010
I think this one is all...

2360
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:24,430
Yeah, it's good for now.

2361
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:26,210
Oh my gosh, thank you!

2362
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:29,070
I can't believe I forgot to do that.

2363
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:42,070
Super glue.

2364
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,340
I'm trying to think if I should add something else.

2365
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:52,440
Maybe another ship.

2366
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:57,020
Maybe another boat because they have so much range.

2367
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,760
Or a sub down here.

2368
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:01,360
Like right here.

2369
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:05,400
More helicopters?

2370
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:07,460
Nah.

2371
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:13,340
Okay.

2372
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:17,830
Boat on lower.

2373
01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:26,630
Okay, so we'll do the boat instead.

2374
01:55:27,550 --> 01:55:28,510
Down here.

2375
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:30,250
And place them.

2376
01:55:30,330 --> 01:55:31,510
There we go.

2377
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:32,530
Nice and cozy.

2378
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:35,950
Nice and cozy.

2379
01:55:38,590 --> 01:55:40,230
What did I do for these guys?

2380
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:42,190
No, not you.

2381
01:55:43,090 --> 01:55:44,850
So it's 5-2, right?

2382
01:55:46,030 --> 01:55:46,770
5-2?

2383
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:56,860
And then more glue is what people are requesting.

2384
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:57,800
I can do more glue.

2385
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:59,320
Especially because we got our other guy before.

2386
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,320
Maybe we put him like...

2387
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:03,360
Wait.

2388
01:56:03,700 --> 01:56:06,180
We can get the buffs here.

2389
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,040
Maybe like here.

2390
01:56:22,550 --> 01:56:23,570
Or over here.

2391
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:24,810
Actually over here might be better.

2392
01:56:25,130 --> 01:56:27,790
Oh my gosh, please stop spamming.

2393
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:32,590
I'm definitely not going to add an ice monkey if you continue to spam.

2394
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:33,290
Thank you.

2395
01:56:35,750 --> 01:56:36,810
Oh my gosh.

2396
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:39,390
Holy cow.

2397
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:39,610
How?

2398
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,460
Sorry, I'm trying to figure out where to place this guy.

2399
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:50,080
Maybe actually here would be better.

2400
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:51,680
Because it's...

2401
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:55,120
Because it'll hit them for down here.

2402
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,240
Okay.

2403
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:58,900
And we're going to glue soak.

2404
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,040
And we're going to glob.

2405
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:03,080
Actually...

2406
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:04,280
Yeah.

2407
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:05,520
We're going to glob it up.

2408
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:06,140
Okay.

2409
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:08,300
Attempt.

2410
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:10,380
Handle it.

2411
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:17,560
Handle it.

2412
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:18,120
Oh my gosh.

2413
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:18,460
Please.

2414
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:22,360
Handle it.

2415
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:23,300
Handle it.

2416
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:37,330
Handle it.

2417
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:37,570
Please.

2418
01:57:39,850 --> 01:57:40,370
Rise.

2419
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:44,260
Okay.

2420
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:45,980
I guess I could have been worse.

2421
01:57:52,820 --> 01:57:54,920
Why does Mindy hate balloons so much?

2422
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:55,900
Balloons?

2423
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:56,640
It's balloons.

2424
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:58,980
Not bad.

2425
01:57:59,300 --> 01:57:59,860
It could be worse.

2426
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:03,040
They still got what down here about.

2427
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:06,340
So...

2428
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,200
What's in?

2429
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,020
Welcome to membership.

2430
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:09,680
Thank you.

2431
01:58:09,820 --> 01:58:13,200
And GK, Siren, welcome to membership.

2432
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:14,840
Monkey.

2433
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:17,440
Ducky, welcome to membership.

2434
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,200
Thank you guys.

2435
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,140
Thank you so much.

2436
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:23,500
Can I slow them down more?

2437
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:24,180
For what?

2438
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:25,560
Ice?

2439
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:26,140
Oh my gosh.

2440
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:26,960
Please, pancake.

2441
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:27,920
Please.

2442
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:36,290
I don't even have my guys upgraded.

2443
01:58:37,130 --> 01:58:38,570
I don't think they'll do much.

2444
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:53,160
Okay.

2445
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:56,480
I think before I mentioned adding another helicopter.

2446
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:58,160
I wish I could put them right in there.

2447
01:58:59,300 --> 01:58:59,740
But...

2448
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:04,060
Unfortunately, he might have to be...

2449
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:08,900
He might have to be...

2450
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:09,460
He might have to be...

2451
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:10,480
Villageless.

2452
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:25,340
You can still help the Spike Factory.

2453
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:26,060
You know what?

2454
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,160
I think you're right actually.

2455
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:28,020
Because...

2456
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:30,240
We're not getting anything from him.

2457
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,840
So yeah, we'll sell him.

2458
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:33,760
What?

2459
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:36,200
Fireball!

2460
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,760
I really want the Necromancer.

2461
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:40,460
I really want the Necromancer.

2462
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,660
07 Spike Factory.

2463
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:52,980
07 Spike Factory.

2464
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,260
I was going to say, can he even fit?

2465
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:03,580
I think I can make him fit to where I can add some other monkeys into.

2466
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,300
Let me see.

2467
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:06,660
Can I put like...

2468
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:09,140
No.

2469
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:10,120
Oh!

2470
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:10,740
A little bit.

2471
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:11,260
A little bit.

2472
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:12,720
A little bit.

2473
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:14,240
A little bit.

2474
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:27,240
Spike Factory has served its purpose.

2475
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:35,460
A zero zero zero ice monkey is insecure.

2476
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:39,720
Let's see.

2477
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:42,360
Okay, we're going to do... I like to do the pursuit.

2478
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,520
We have Moab Shove.

2479
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:46,700
Do I want another one though?

2480
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:55,500
Shove is amplified by bigger jets and our little guys when they're needed.

2481
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:59,760
I'm wondering if I should just do four two on this one.

2482
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:03,620
I can only go up to three though.

2483
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:07,660
I don't have the Apache Dart ship.

2484
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:09,660
I don't have Apache monkey.

2485
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:13,820
How do you say this?

2486
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:16,700
Comanchi?

2487
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:18,800
Comanchi?

2488
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:21,920
204 spam!

2489
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,340
You'll get to four soon enough.

2490
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:28,740
I don't think in this though.

2491
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,560
Because I'm not... I'm higher.

2492
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:32,860
So the XP is way lower.

2493
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:35,600
If you like tower defense, check out Domekeeper.

2494
02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:36,360
Oh, I do.

2495
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:37,480
Trip trap!

2496
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,440
Welcome to membership.

2497
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:41,140
Comanchi.

2498
02:01:43,180 --> 02:01:43,700
Comanchi.

2499
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:50,100
Another 204.

2500
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:52,160
I think I feel safer like that.

2501
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:57,460
Because then I can do the high level one, you know?

2502
02:01:57,580 --> 02:01:58,000
Okay.

2503
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:59,260
Here we go!

2504
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:02,720
Handle it!

2505
02:02:04,240 --> 02:02:04,740
ZOMG!

2506
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:06,840
Handle it!

2507
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:13,540
Handle it!

2508
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:17,140
Handle it!

2509
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:18,200
Nice!

2510
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:19,420
Handle it!

2511
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:24,460
It's barely moving because both of them are shoving.

2512
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:32,260
Let's go!

2513
02:02:35,930 --> 02:02:40,470
Yeah, the sniper and the two planes are just making him like stuck there.

2514
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:41,370
Nice.

2515
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:41,890
You know what?

2516
02:02:42,070 --> 02:02:44,110
I'm even gonna go for round the next round.

2517
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:46,350
This might be a mistake but...

2518
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:51,830
This might be a mistake but...

2519
02:02:58,120 --> 02:02:59,540
Nature prevails, baby!

2520
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:00,700
Nature prevails!

2521
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:07,120
Don't bust it!

2522
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:07,500
No!

2523
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:09,720
Uh-oh!

2524
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:10,300
Uh-oh!

2525
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:10,960
Uh-oh!

2526
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:11,440
Uh-oh!

2527
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:11,980
Uh-oh!

2528
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:15,420
Oh my god!

2529
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:15,720
No!

2530
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:16,500
I'm gonna die!

2531
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:18,240
I'm

2532
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:26,620
gonna die!

2533
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:34,540
I just wanted to get to level one!

2534
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:35,500
I just...

2535
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:42,720
The last round was such a tease!

2536
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:45,440
It made me feel so confident.

2537
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,680
We were two levels away.

2538
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:56,400
98 is one of the hardest rounds.

2539
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:57,180
Gosh!

2540
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:02,920
Okay, Icarus...

2541
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:03,180
Hey!

2542
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:06,900
What would have happened if you had the 0-0-0 Ice Monkey?

2543
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:11,960
Not sure how monkeys got their hands on...

2544
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:13,100
Comanche's...

2545
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:17,380
When the Comanche program was cancelled 20 years ago before it even entered production.

2546
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:23,120
Look, monkey technology is not for you to judge, okay?

2547
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:26,540
Ugh!

2548
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:28,840
You Vegeta-ed it.

2549
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:29,320
Stop!

2550
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:32,260
Only you listen to Ice Monkey.

2551
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:32,560
Oh my god.

2552
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:39,520
It's mint over.

2553
02:04:47,230 --> 02:04:48,670
Dang you!

2554
02:04:49,910 --> 02:04:50,790
Dang you!

2555
02:04:51,070 --> 02:04:51,510
Wait!

2556
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:54,250
It's free!

2557
02:04:55,250 --> 02:04:56,730
If I want to continue!

2558
02:04:58,910 --> 02:05:00,250
Need more high-end D.

2559
02:05:00,370 --> 02:05:01,570
Free continue!

2560
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:05,770
For free?

2561
02:05:05,810 --> 02:05:06,450
Do not!

2562
02:05:07,090 --> 02:05:07,950
Why not?

2563
02:05:08,090 --> 02:05:09,170
We can get to level 100!

2564
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:11,150
Right?

2565
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:15,820
Only the first continues free.

2566
02:05:21,740 --> 02:05:23,380
Just level the monkeys?

2567
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:25,040
You're probably right.

2568
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:29,480
It would be better to get more experience.

2569
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:32,440
Look, that monkey is just like me.

2570
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:38,040
Monkey is just like me.

2571
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:38,120
Yeah.

2572
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:52,880
Game over.

2573
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:00,910
No,

2574
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:10,120
stop.

2575
02:06:10,240 --> 02:06:11,820
You're taking my spotlight, monkey.

2576
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:13,740
Oh, whoa, whoa.

2577
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:14,360
My bad.

2578
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,140
Game over!

2579
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:28,220
Okay.

2580
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:34,500
Whoa.

2581
02:06:35,180 --> 02:06:35,740
Yeah.

2582
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:37,380
Yeah.

2583
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,760
Why are you like this?

2584
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,060
What are you talking about?

2585
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:50,640
Collection event?

2586
02:06:51,460 --> 02:06:52,700
I'm collecting a monkey!

2587
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:58,340
Insta-monkey!

2588
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:02,180
Insta-monkey!

2589
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:07,750
Neat!

2590
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:08,730
Wait, what are these?

2591
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:12,950
Featured insta-monkeys.

2592
02:07:13,210 --> 02:07:13,950
I want that.

2593
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:15,690
Wait, someone said buy the fountain, right?

2594
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:16,690
This guy...

2595
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:18,730
There's a...

2596
02:07:18,730 --> 02:07:20,670
Is it a challenge to get the monkey?

2597
02:07:21,610 --> 02:07:22,130
No.

2598
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:23,970
Tutorial to get the monkey?

2599
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:26,870
You can get whatever the hell these are.

2600
02:07:27,030 --> 02:07:28,250
Experiments on the monkey?

2601
02:07:29,130 --> 02:07:29,970
Five rounds.

2602
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:33,170
Fifty MOAB class bloons on each round?

2603
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:37,230
How much money did they give you at first?

2604
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:40,250
The raids.

2605
02:07:40,490 --> 02:07:41,270
Oh, is that what it is?

2606
02:07:41,330 --> 02:07:41,450
Wait.

2607
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:42,630
How do you see the raids?

2608
02:07:43,070 --> 02:07:43,630
Hold on.

2609
02:07:45,770 --> 02:07:46,530
Monkey boost.

2610
02:07:57,230 --> 02:07:57,670
Events?

2611
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:05,920
How do you need to be level 40?

2612
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:06,640
Whoa.

2613
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:07,980
Shucks.

2614
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:10,260
Play social.

2615
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:15,900
I want to change my mind.

2616
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:16,140
Oh.

2617
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:17,100
Good, good, good.

2618
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:19,240
Let's change to general mon...

2619
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:19,580
Oh, no.

2620
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:20,380
Sniper monkey.

2621
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:21,220
My favorite.

2622
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:24,640
My favorite sniper monkey.

2623
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:27,360
Any new heroes?

2624
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:30,340
I think I have to pay for all of them.

2625
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,280
There he is.

2626
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:32,700
The Pat Fusty.

2627
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:34,440
Benjamin.

2628
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:38,160
Eliza.

2629
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:39,640
Adoro.

2630
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,660
I don't have so much money though.

2631
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:44,380
I can't even afford a single monkey.

2632
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:46,060
Hmm.

2633
02:08:59,360 --> 02:08:59,920
Giraldo.

2634
02:09:00,260 --> 02:09:01,100
The goat.

2635
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:02,520
Giraldo.

2636
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,220
I like Corvus.

2637
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,000
Is this guy new?

2638
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:10,620
A guide to the book of spirits.

2639
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:14,200
Help Corvus harvest the bloons on dark path.

2640
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:15,980
What does he do though?

2641
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:16,740
Oh, here.

2642
02:09:17,140 --> 02:09:18,680
Haunted bloons.

2643
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:21,440
Are weakened and explode when popped.

2644
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:23,180
Adding mana to the mana pool.

2645
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:26,020
The spirit.

2646
02:09:26,020 --> 02:09:29,000
The spirit attacks bloons wherever on the map of Corvus's command.

2647
02:09:30,820 --> 02:09:31,300
Interesting.

2648
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:32,620
Hard...

2649
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:34,540
It's amazing but hard to use optimally.

2650
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:34,940
Hmm.

2651
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,880
Corvus is too complicated.

2652
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:39,440
Whoa.

2653
02:09:40,140 --> 02:09:40,620
My...

2654
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:40,940
Whoa.

2655
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:44,840
He's awesome.

2656
02:09:46,340 --> 02:09:47,300
I like how...

2657
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:47,640
I like...

2658
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:48,480
I like this guy.

2659
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:48,940
That's me.

2660
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:52,220
Oh, yes.

2661
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:53,540
I like when they have different outfits.

2662
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:55,120
I know they're just cosmetic.

2663
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:56,280
But they look so cool.

2664
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:56,800
Wait.

2665
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:57,280
Does he have one?

2666
02:09:58,280 --> 02:09:58,840
No.

2667
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:00,320
Whoa.

2668
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:03,220
Ocean Guardian.

2669
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:08,800
Corvus can solo?

2670
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:09,980
That's insane.

2671
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:12,100
Sada is good for being a nurse.

2672
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:15,560
I love this one.

2673
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,720
This Yangshi is so cute.

2674
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:20,860
What is...

2675
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:21,820
I've never played a Sada.

2676
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:24,560
Slashes.

2677
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:25,060
Oh.

2678
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:26,580
Can pop camo.

2679
02:10:28,140 --> 02:10:28,700
She's so cute.

2680
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:29,020
She's awesome.

2681
02:10:34,940 --> 02:10:36,040
She's so cute.

2682
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:41,290
She's really good on most maps.

2683
02:10:43,570 --> 02:10:44,770
Someone said Giral...

2684
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:45,590
Oh, here's Giraldo.

2685
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:46,270
Oh.

2686
02:10:47,110 --> 02:10:47,970
It's cute.

2687
02:10:49,090 --> 02:10:49,690
Gadgeteer.

2688
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:52,410
Paragon belt.

2689
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:53,530
I'll be honest.

2690
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:57,470
Like, I don't really read what they do.

2691
02:10:57,690 --> 02:10:58,690
It's probably bad.

2692
02:10:58,990 --> 02:11:00,290
There's just so many effects.

2693
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:02,890
There's so many.

2694
02:11:03,330 --> 02:11:04,130
I like it.

2695
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:05,050
I like Striker Jones too.

2696
02:11:05,210 --> 02:11:06,590
Oh my god.

2697
02:11:06,790 --> 02:11:07,590
Octo Jones.

2698
02:11:07,890 --> 02:11:08,930
He's so cute.

2699
02:11:10,850 --> 02:11:11,750
Biker bones.

2700
02:11:15,190 --> 02:11:16,650
Giraldo sells stuff he can use.

2701
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:17,130
Oh, really?

2702
02:11:20,950 --> 02:11:23,170
I like Ben because he just gives you more money.

2703
02:11:23,230 --> 02:11:24,530
Nothing complicated or crazy.

2704
02:11:24,730 --> 02:11:25,270
Love that.

2705
02:11:25,590 --> 02:11:26,290
I love that.

2706
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:28,750
Hi Mentos, one time.

2707
02:11:28,870 --> 02:11:31,190
Random question but I need to satisfy my curiosity.

2708
02:11:31,470 --> 02:11:33,210
Are you interested in playing Touhou fan games?

2709
02:11:33,410 --> 02:11:34,110
Thanks for speaking.

2710
02:11:34,110 --> 02:11:36,510
Yeah, I would be interested.

2711
02:11:37,690 --> 02:11:39,490
I can play whatever I want now.

2712
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:42,410
There was actually some Touhou...

2713
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:44,850
I guess you would call them fan games.

2714
02:11:45,050 --> 02:11:45,770
Not official.

2715
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:50,730
Some other Touhou games on Steam that I'd wanted to play before but never could.

2716
02:11:51,870 --> 02:11:54,850
So now I will have the opportunity to, I think.

2717
02:11:57,370 --> 02:11:58,550
Not I think.

2718
02:11:58,630 --> 02:11:59,110
I know.

2719
02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:02,670
I saw...

2720
02:12:02,670 --> 02:12:03,270
I saw...

2721
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:04,070
I saw...

2722
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:04,090
I saw...

2723
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:06,630
I saw Fuwawa playing Mountain of Faith the other day.

2724
02:12:06,650 --> 02:12:09,330
I was watching her and I was like, this is making me want to play Touhou.

2725
02:12:11,010 --> 02:12:11,550
Uh oh.

2726
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:13,570
I also want to play Mountain of Faith.

2727
02:12:14,090 --> 02:12:15,270
Maybe not Mountain of Faith.

2728
02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:18,950
I don't know which one I would want to play.

2729
02:12:21,270 --> 02:12:21,670
Hmm.

2730
02:12:25,790 --> 02:12:28,330
But I love the music in Mountain of Faith so much.

2731
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:30,450
SA.

2732
02:12:32,070 --> 02:12:35,950
I was never good at Subterranean Anime.

2733
02:12:35,950 --> 02:12:37,910
I'm never good at it.

2734
02:12:38,010 --> 02:12:42,510
I was thinking UFO but I don't know.

2735
02:12:42,590 --> 02:12:47,830
I'll try practicing more off stream so that when I play I can actually like get somewhere.

2736
02:12:50,950 --> 02:12:51,910
Because it's...

2737
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:55,910
First of all, I need to be good enough to overcome my performance anxiety.

2738
02:12:57,970 --> 02:13:02,710
Do not play Mystia's Izakaya or you'll lose 60 plus hours of your life to it.

2739
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:05,090
That's one of the ones I wanted to play though.

2740
02:13:05,570 --> 02:13:06,430
Oh my gosh.

2741
02:13:07,250 --> 02:13:08,210
Mystia's Izakaya.

2742
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:09,850
What kind of game is it?

2743
02:13:10,770 --> 02:13:11,590
I think I...

2744
02:13:11,590 --> 02:13:11,750
Wait.

2745
02:13:11,790 --> 02:13:12,330
Did I buy it?

2746
02:13:12,990 --> 02:13:13,670
I do.

2747
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:14,330
I own it.

2748
02:13:16,730 --> 02:13:17,810
I own it.

2749
02:13:17,850 --> 02:13:18,390
I bought it.

2750
02:13:19,470 --> 02:13:22,590
Highly recommend Mystia's Izakaya on Hero of Iceberry.

2751
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:23,670
Super tough.

2752
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:27,090
At first though, Clown Piece kicked my ass three times.

2753
02:13:27,790 --> 02:13:29,130
Let's just restaurant sim.

2754
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:29,750
Oh god.

2755
02:13:29,830 --> 02:13:30,890
That sounds so fun.

2756
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:31,630
And there's lots of...

2757
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:32,590
Holy moly.

2758
02:13:32,590 --> 02:13:33,290
There's so much DLC.

2759
02:13:33,870 --> 02:13:35,070
Does this count as a DLC?

2760
02:13:35,090 --> 02:13:35,570
It's a fan game.

2761
02:13:35,770 --> 02:13:36,170
I mean...

2762
02:13:37,330 --> 02:13:41,150
It has so much content, but I guess it's a fan game though, right?

2763
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:49,200
Is it a fan game?

2764
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:53,880
I do own it though.

2765
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,320
After...

2766
02:13:56,320 --> 02:14:06,060
I was thinking because I'm like trying to figure out like a schedule-ish type of what I'm doing for like longer form games.

2767
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:09,320
Like right now, I would say Ghost Trick is like the longer game.

2768
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:11,640
Longer game I'm playing right now.

2769
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:14,780
I think after Ghost Trick, I'll play...

2770
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:22,620
Oh my god.

2771
02:14:22,660 --> 02:14:22,940
Stop.

2772
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:24,460
I just looked this up the other night.

2773
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:26,960
And I couldn't remember the name of it the other night.

2774
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:27,440
I was like...

2775
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:28,600
I was like, no way.

2776
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:29,640
Hold on.

2777
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:32,960
Oh my god.

2778
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:34,120
My brain.

2779
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:36,540
She plays Xenoblade.

2780
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:37,580
I actually do.

2781
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:40,840
Kamaniki told me to play it and I said I would.

2782
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:43,360
So...

2783
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:45,400
I think I have to play it.

2784
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,280
But...

2785
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:47,500
I'm...

2786
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:50,740
Hesitant to start such a huge...

2787
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:52,800
Such a huge thing...

2788
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:53,800
Right now.

2789
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:55,400
But...

2790
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,360
Xenoblade will be eventually...

2791
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:58,240
Most likely.

2792
02:14:58,860 --> 02:15:01,140
They just finished translating the last DLC for the...

2793
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:01,560
2.

2794
02:15:01,640 --> 02:15:03,680
The Izakaya team are super cracked for being so small.

2795
02:15:03,740 --> 02:15:04,380
That's so awesome.

2796
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:05,800
Mike!

2797
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:06,860
Thanks for the...

2798
02:15:06,860 --> 02:15:07,460
Pink!

2799
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:09,800
This is the Purgatory Maid Cafe.

2800
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:13,360
We would like to inform you that in recognition of your 10,000th visit...

2801
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:15,320
You are now a Platinum tier member.

2802
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:18,140
However, we humbly request that on your next visit...

2803
02:15:18,140 --> 02:15:20,360
You cease to Wotage with the breadsticks.

2804
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:22,700
You can't tell me what to do!

2805
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:28,720
As your Platinum member, I should have permission to Wotage with whatever I please.

2806
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:29,840
Even if it's...

2807
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:30,320
Like...

2808
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:32,880
Even if I grab someone's feet...

2809
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:34,780
And swing the person around...

2810
02:15:34,780 --> 02:15:35,320
Like...

2811
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:35,940
Pen lights.

2812
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:40,600
Baking a cheesecake for my mom for Mother's Day.

2813
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:42,560
Never made one before but it smells good in the oven.

2814
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:43,100
Wish me luck!

2815
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:43,940
Good luck!

2816
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:45,440
I've made cheesecake before.

2817
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:46,280
It's not so difficult.

2818
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:47,740
It's pretty good.

2819
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:48,120
It's...

2820
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:48,720
It's pretty...

2821
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:49,500
It's not so bad.

2822
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:53,460
Oh yeah.

2823
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:54,120
Um...

2824
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:54,460
Yeah...

2825
02:15:54,460 --> 02:15:56,160
I'm not going to buy anything right now.

2826
02:15:59,420 --> 02:16:00,420
I'm going to switch the...

2827
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:01,900
Riding Quincy.

2828
02:16:04,740 --> 02:16:05,760
What have I bought?

2829
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:06,540
Oh!

2830
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:08,060
I wouldn't want to level up to 20 though.

2831
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,580
Wolf Pack Quincy.

2832
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:13,580
I'm going to switch to Quincy though, so we can hear...

2833
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:16,880
So we can hear... Are you kidding me?

2834
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:18,340
Are you kidding me?

2835
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:19,940
Are you kidding me?

2836
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:23,400
Just look this up.

2837
02:16:23,420 --> 02:16:24,800
The highest round someone got was...

2838
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,320
3,275!

2839
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:28,540
Now my round 250 seems small.

2840
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:31,180
Thanks for stream.

2841
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:32,040
I'm not done yet!

2842
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:33,140
Sunday is my birthday.

2843
02:16:33,260 --> 02:16:33,860
Can I get a song?

2844
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:35,260
What would it be?

2845
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:38,560
Like...

2846
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:40,080
Otagei move?

2847
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:42,080
Or Otagei like...

2848
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:43,460
Hold on.

2849
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,520
I'm going to pick a thing real quick.

2850
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:46,000
So I can stop listening to this song.

2851
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:47,440
Oh!

2852
02:16:47,480 --> 02:16:49,000
The loop has a golden balloon.

2853
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:49,800
So let's do that one.

2854
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:54,240
Do you mean like...

2855
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:55,540
Otagei as in like...

2856
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:58,300
A move?

2857
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:01,040
Or do you mean like...

2858
02:17:01,460 --> 02:17:02,180
Thunder snake?

2859
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:03,820
I don't know.

2860
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,800
I feel like thunder snake might be kind of hard for people.

2861
02:17:06,580 --> 02:17:08,400
You can start with the simple stuff.

2862
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:09,060
Like...

2863
02:17:09,060 --> 02:17:10,280
O.A.D.

2864
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:11,340
And...

2865
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:13,240
And...

2866
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:19,600
P.P.P.H.

2867
02:17:21,940 --> 02:17:22,900
And then...

2868
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:24,760
But once you learn thunder snake...

2869
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:26,440
I'll admit you feel pretty cool doing it.

2870
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:30,100
All in with namaste snake.

2871
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:30,700
That too.

2872
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:35,300
Time to do it.

2873
02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:36,300
Otagei teaching stream.

2874
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:37,980
The day I get 3D.

2875
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:43,140
I have to do that and I have to do a dance cover of...

2876
02:17:43,140 --> 02:17:44,180
Umamushime.

2877
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:48,500
I finally can do that.

2878
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,840
If I get 3D.

2879
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:53,560
I'll actually have 3D.

2880
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:56,940
So I can use it.

2881
02:18:00,790 --> 02:18:01,310
Okay.

2882
02:18:02,030 --> 02:18:03,350
Quincy my man.

2883
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:04,970
My man Quincy.

2884
02:18:07,410 --> 02:18:08,750
And then this map...

2885
02:18:08,750 --> 02:18:10,650
We can put sniper wolf anywhere.

2886
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:11,610
So it's fine.

2887
02:18:13,050 --> 02:18:13,570
Um...

2888
02:18:14,230 --> 02:18:15,310
What is Quincy...

2889
02:18:15,310 --> 02:18:16,770
Oh Quincy's range is pretty good actually.

2890
02:18:17,870 --> 02:18:19,430
I'm gonna put you right here in the middle.

2891
02:18:19,790 --> 02:18:20,810
Alright good job Quincy.

2892
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:22,690
Just give me a target.

2893
02:18:23,110 --> 02:18:23,630
Yes?

2894
02:18:26,150 --> 02:18:26,670
Yes?

2895
02:18:27,130 --> 02:18:27,650
Yes?

2896
02:18:28,110 --> 02:18:28,630
Yes?

2897
02:18:34,070 --> 02:18:35,870
Just give me a target.

2898
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:40,180
Yes?

2899
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:41,100
Yes?

2900
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:41,240
Yes?

2901
02:18:41,940 --> 02:18:42,500
Yes?

2902
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:43,560
Yes?

2903
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:44,580
Yes?

2904
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:47,220
Yes?

2905
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:49,480
Yes?

2906
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:51,560
Nice.

2907
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:54,260
Okay.

2908
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:56,000
Sha!

2909
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:56,560
Sha!

2910
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:57,260
Sha!

2911
02:18:57,360 --> 02:18:57,920
Sha!

2912
02:18:58,300 --> 02:18:58,420
Sha!

2913
02:18:58,420 --> 02:18:58,940
Sha!

2914
02:18:58,940 --> 02:18:59,360
Sha!

2915
02:18:59,420 --> 02:18:59,820
Sha!

2916
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:00,180
Sha!

2917
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:03,240
Easy peasy.

2918
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:05,680
On the chocolate river map.

2919
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:07,380
You can find monkeys hidden in the map.

2920
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:08,500
And you click them in the right order.

2921
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,900
I think I have done that before.

2922
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:15,500
I think I have done that before.

2923
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:15,820
Okay.

2924
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:18,220
Guys before we get any further.

2925
02:19:18,500 --> 02:19:20,660
What are some monkeys, not ice monkeys.

2926
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:22,280
That we are trying to level up.

2927
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:24,020
Like...

2928
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:25,040
Tack monkey.

2929
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:27,100
And uh...

2930
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:28,420
Wizard monkey!

2931
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:29,240
Okay.

2932
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:30,620
Buy wizard monkey.

2933
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:33,760
Buy the wizard monkey.

2934
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:33,940
Ice monkey.

2935
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:36,980
Oh yeah.

2936
02:19:39,380 --> 02:19:41,200
I'm not listening to anything.

2937
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:43,260
Anything.

2938
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:45,780
That says ice monkey.

2939
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:50,180
Especially if nanoplasm says ice monkey.

2940
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:55,400
I don't even know if that person is still here.

2941
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:57,180
I might have really made them mad.

2942
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:00,020
Sorry.

2943
02:20:01,140 --> 02:20:02,520
I don't even know.

2944
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:08,080
Ninja monkey.

2945
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:10,920
Oh um...

2946
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:12,700
Because I want the balloon jutsu.

2947
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:14,380
Balloon jutsu.

2948
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:17,000
Have I been saying balloon jutsu this whole time?

2949
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:19,080
Balloon jutsu.

2950
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:21,280
Wow he looks so awesome.

2951
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:22,700
In this outfit though.

2952
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:24,640
He looks cool there too though.

2953
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:25,860
But this one is so cool.

2954
02:20:27,420 --> 02:20:27,880
Wow!

2955
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:30,460
Oh wait.

2956
02:20:30,740 --> 02:20:31,400
This is the...

2957
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:35,680
This guy is scratching his head.

2958
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:36,400
Like why am I here?

2959
02:20:37,980 --> 02:20:39,680
Okay do something wizard monkey.

2960
02:20:40,900 --> 02:20:41,620
Uh oh.

2961
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:43,060
Wow wizard monkey.

2962
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:43,720
Wow.

2963
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:46,780
We'll do the spikes here.

2964
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:49,760
Oh my gosh wizard monkey.

2965
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:52,060
You really let the ball down there.

2966
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:55,200
Okay we'll put...

2967
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:57,760
I usually put this one in here.

2968
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:00,060
But we'll wait for spikes monkey.

2969
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:01,960
We'll wait for spikes monkey.

2970
02:21:02,020 --> 02:21:03,040
He can already evolve.

2971
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:05,340
Intense magic.

2972
02:21:06,060 --> 02:21:07,500
Oh he turned into a monkey.

2973
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:07,740
He turned into a nerd.

2974
02:21:14,250 --> 02:21:16,510
Wizard monkey is a 000 tower.

2975
02:21:19,110 --> 02:21:20,170
He's doing his best.

2976
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:23,850
He became blind.

2977
02:21:26,550 --> 02:21:28,970
What is this astronaut monkey anyway?

2978
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:31,170
I can't tell.

2979
02:21:31,290 --> 02:21:32,510
It looks like he's wearing a space suit.

2980
02:21:33,270 --> 02:21:33,910
Okay.

2981
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:35,830
Attack monkey will be in the middle.

2982
02:21:36,130 --> 02:21:36,770
Here.

2983
02:21:37,710 --> 02:21:38,350
Here.

2984
02:21:41,390 --> 02:21:42,330
We're going to get our submarines too.

2985
02:21:42,450 --> 02:21:42,650
Right?

2986
02:21:43,150 --> 02:21:44,490
Because we're trying to get...

2987
02:21:46,530 --> 02:21:47,410
Wait no.

2988
02:21:47,550 --> 02:21:50,570
We're trying to get a preemptive strike.

2989
02:21:50,670 --> 02:21:51,010
Right?

2990
02:21:51,170 --> 02:21:52,790
So I'm going to put one guy in there too.

2991
02:21:55,290 --> 02:21:56,170
Wow Quincy.

2992
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:09,340
I've got a fever and the only cure is ice monkey.

2993
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:11,620
Are you actually sick?

2994
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:19,380
Oh I forgot to spend money on my intense magic.

2995
02:22:26,660 --> 02:22:27,260
Alchemist monkey?

2996
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:29,920
What were we trying to level up for him?

2997
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:33,940
We still have to do the top one though right?

2998
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:40,000
I don't know where I want to put him.

2999
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:40,300
I don't know where I want to put him yet though.

3000
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:44,060
Yeah, we trying to do the top one.

3001
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:46,980
I do want to get this guy down too though.

3002
02:22:47,720 --> 02:22:48,080
Oh wait I know now.

3003
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:58,280
My guide says 0-0-0 my ice monkey is best in the corner where I can't hit anything is the best slot.

3004
02:23:00,740 --> 02:23:04,820
Everyone has a 0-0-0 ice monkey on their map, obviously.

3005
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:09,240
4-2 Alcazope.

3006
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:10,920
That's what we're trying to get here.

3007
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:12,680
But I don't know where to put him.

3008
02:23:17,740 --> 02:23:20,000
I guess I can put him here with everybody, right?

3009
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:22,300
I can have him like kind of like that.

3010
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:24,860
Or maybe...

3011
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:28,340
Where will he cover most monkey ground?

3012
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:31,300
He broke monkey ground!

3013
02:23:32,780 --> 02:23:34,000
Ice monkey in bio.

3014
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:34,840
Near Quincy?

3015
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:37,720
So it's like right there.

3016
02:23:37,780 --> 02:23:38,040
Good.

3017
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:39,320
Okay.

3018
02:23:45,080 --> 02:23:46,220
Sneak up on him.

3019
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:48,820
Sneak up on him.

3020
02:23:48,920 --> 02:23:50,000
Like right...

3021
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,760
Actually, I want enough space here.

3022
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:53,440
So we'll put him right...

3023
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:53,700
Here.

3024
02:23:55,300 --> 02:23:57,820
I love when they're all really good friends.

3025
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:00,120
Oh.

3026
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:06,620
Can't even tell if he's doing anything.

3027
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:09,980
Some monkey is just...

3028
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:11,940
Look how cute he is in the little boat.

3029
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:12,400
He's like...

3030
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:13,200
La la la.

3031
02:24:13,300 --> 02:24:15,140
He's like rocking side to side.

3032
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:16,700
He's so cute.

3033
02:24:17,900 --> 02:24:18,420
Little...

3034
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:20,160
He's just a little guy.

3035
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:23,020
Oh, he's so funny.

3036
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:25,300
Monkey sense.

3037
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:27,100
Monkey sense.

3038
02:24:28,440 --> 02:24:29,320
Monkey sense.

3039
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:29,860
Monkey sense.

3040
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:34,920
Monkey dollars and monkey cents.

3041
02:24:37,940 --> 02:24:39,360
Sub will shoot if you get the top two.

3042
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:40,280
Yeah, we're gonna...

3043
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:41,720
That one will be...

3044
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:42,080
Oh, wait.

3045
02:24:43,060 --> 02:24:43,500
Yes.

3046
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:44,400
Wait.

3047
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:46,260
No, we're going for the middle one.

3048
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:46,940
Sorry.

3049
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:50,100
We're going for middle barbed darts.

3050
02:24:53,380 --> 02:24:55,520
Why is the chat crazy about Ice Monkey?

3051
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:59,840
Because there was someone in here earlier who was spamming that they really wanted Ice Monkey.

3052
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:02,060
So...

3053
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:11,880
You can do the top two then go for middle.

3054
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:12,180
Oh.

3055
02:25:12,280 --> 02:25:13,040
I guess that's true.

3056
02:25:13,140 --> 02:25:13,740
You're right.

3057
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,060
You're so right.

3058
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:16,980
Go.

3059
02:25:20,140 --> 02:25:20,620
Shoot.

3060
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:21,220
Shoot.

3061
02:25:21,400 --> 02:25:21,720
Shoot.

3062
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:24,280
Shoot.

3063
02:25:24,660 --> 02:25:24,840
Shoot.

3064
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:25,800
Shoot.

3065
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:26,140
Shoot.

3066
02:25:26,140 --> 02:25:26,580
Shoot.

3067
02:25:26,580 --> 02:25:26,600
Shoot.

3068
02:25:26,600 --> 02:25:27,040
Shoot.

3069
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:28,580
Shoot.

3070
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:34,420
I'm sure Ice Monkey is a really nice guy, okay?

3071
02:25:40,490 --> 02:25:41,570
Oh, the hearts.

3072
02:25:42,590 --> 02:25:43,530
The hearts...

3073
02:25:43,530 --> 02:25:43,990
I'm confused.

3074
02:25:44,190 --> 02:25:46,750
Do they grow more hearts or do they just regrow their layers?

3075
02:25:50,270 --> 02:25:52,130
Which monkey is your monkey-sona?

3076
02:26:01,410 --> 02:26:02,390
Oh, they regrow.

3077
02:26:03,710 --> 02:26:05,050
So they regrow layers.

3078
02:26:05,170 --> 02:26:05,330
Okay.

3079
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:12,280
Ohh, yeah.

3080
02:26:12,380 --> 02:26:12,900
Alright!

3081
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:13,720
Yeah!

3082
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:14,000
Joshua!

3083
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:15,340
Thank you for the akasuba!

3084
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:19,660
It could have used a little more ice monkey.

3085
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:23,460
I gotta have more ice monkey, baby!

3086
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:27,560
Why did you send an akasuba for the ice monkey?

3087
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:41,020
Why would you do that?

3088
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:42,800
Why would you do that?

3089
02:26:44,460 --> 02:26:45,020
Why?

3090
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:45,580
Joshua!

3091
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:48,520
Why?

3092
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:51,620
Balls in your court, missy.

3093
02:26:51,620 --> 02:26:52,080
Oh no.

3094
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:56,700
Can I even afford... I can't even afford the ice monkey!

3095
02:26:57,140 --> 02:26:58,680
I can't even afford him!

3096
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:17,480
How's your Friday going, you guys?

3097
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:18,700
Do you have any plans for the weekend?

3098
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:21,580
Welcome to membership.

3099
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:23,320
Thank you so much!

3100
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:27,560
He sent you a hundred dollars.

3101
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:28,200
You gotta...

3102
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:29,240
I just bought something else.

3103
02:27:29,380 --> 02:27:30,420
Oh, I can't afford him now.

3104
02:27:30,820 --> 02:27:31,480
Okay, fine.

3105
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:33,420
This is for you, Joshua.

3106
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:38,000
He freezes one balloon at a time.

3107
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:40,100
Ice monkey funds.

3108
02:27:44,180 --> 02:27:44,880
Not really.

3109
02:27:44,940 --> 02:27:45,980
I plan to dye my hair.

3110
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:48,200
Wait, by yourself?

3111
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:49,040
Or are you going somewhere?

3112
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:51,820
It's already weekend in my country.

3113
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:55,200
What are your plans?

3114
02:27:56,620 --> 02:27:57,940
What does he do?

3115
02:27:58,760 --> 02:28:00,520
I started that, but I don't even know.

3116
02:28:00,720 --> 02:28:01,300
Come on!

3117
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:05,180
Ice monkey!

3118
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:08,820
Okay, so what's the best route for ice monkey now?

3119
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:11,440
Let's see...

3120
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:15,580
Frozen bloons grow sharp icicles that can pop bloons that touch them.

3121
02:28:17,060 --> 02:28:19,000
Freezes all regular bloons on screen.

3122
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:25,680
0, 0, 0, of course.

3123
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:28,480
I hate you guys so much.

3124
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:31,280
I hate you guys so much.

3125
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:35,440
Fine, I'm gonna keep him there.

3126
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:36,800
I'm gonna keep him there.

3127
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:39,060
And he is going to be 0, 0, 0 the whole time.

3128
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:42,720
WestTrip, happy birthday!

3129
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:44,880
Look at your profile picture.

3130
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:46,640
Happy birthday!

3131
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:50,600
Happy birthday, me, mom.

3132
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:53,840
Happy birthday, me, mom.

3133
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:57,720
Happy birthday, WestTrip, me, mom.

3134
02:28:58,900 --> 02:29:00,780
Me, me, mom, mom.

3135
02:29:01,960 --> 02:29:04,300
Me, me, mom, mom.

3136
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:06,760
Happy birthday!

3137
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:12,560
Ice monkey sucks.

3138
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:13,300
Please sell it.

3139
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:13,700
Sorry.

3140
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:15,520
Sorry.

3141
02:29:15,580 --> 02:29:16,700
If you want me to sell it...

3142
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:17,860
No, I'm just kidding.

3143
02:29:17,940 --> 02:29:18,820
Please don't do that, actually.

3144
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:21,060
Please don't do that.

3145
02:29:21,100 --> 02:29:22,360
The ice monkey is not worth it.

3146
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:23,520
It's not worth a bit.

3147
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:23,960
Please.

3148
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:29,800
Also, I love that ice monkey 0, 0, 0 donated in Streamlabs.

3149
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:37,320
One of the ice monkey's freeze blast sound effects is similar to the one...

3150
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:38,220
The friend.

3151
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:40,140
Fruit quench sounds...

3152
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:41,440
Did I say French?

3153
02:29:42,460 --> 02:29:44,900
When slicing fruit in Fruit Ninja.

3154
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:48,920
I have never played Fruit Ninja.

3155
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:54,640
LilyBweeze, you're gonna have to keep that name until YouTube allows you to change it back.

3156
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:55,740
Just letting you know.

3157
02:29:59,640 --> 02:30:00,600
It's okay.

3158
02:30:00,840 --> 02:30:01,220
It's okay.

3159
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:01,640
Where are we at?

3160
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:05,080
I want to have this guy out, so...

3161
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:17,310
Long reach, maybe?

3162
02:30:17,810 --> 02:30:19,850
But I want the bigger stacks, maybe.

3163
02:30:26,240 --> 02:30:27,240
Not there!

3164
02:30:27,580 --> 02:30:29,120
Oh my god... Mike!

3165
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:33,280
Ice... Ice Monkey...

3166
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:36,180
Worth...

3167
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:40,660
Please sell the Ice Monkey, then buy another one at...

3168
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:42,420
He's at zero zero zero!

3169
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:45,640
I didn't upgrade him!

3170
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:52,040
He's zero zero... He has no upgrades!

3171
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,720
He's zero already!

3172
02:30:59,220 --> 02:30:59,960
Stop!

3173
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:03,100
That's a bad one.

3174
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,600
Yo, it's not worth it, you guys!

3175
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:09,360
Go to the next one and buy a membership!

3176
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:13,240
Sell the Ice Monkey!

3177
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:19,100
Look, he's juggling with the ice, you guys!

3178
02:31:19,700 --> 02:31:21,660
How am I supposed to sell this?

3179
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:25,360
Okay...

3180
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:27,740
Oh

3181
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:31,660
my god!

3182
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,060
Keep him in!

3183
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:34,960
Look at his greatness!

3184
02:31:35,380 --> 02:31:36,740
Buy another zero zero!

3185
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:38,920
What after you sell it?

3186
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:39,900
Please!

3187
02:31:43,980 --> 02:31:47,040
I said I was gonna keep him zero zero zero!

3188
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:49,640
No!

3189
02:31:50,100 --> 02:31:52,140
I'd like to cancel Ice Monkey!

3190
02:31:52,940 --> 02:31:53,600
No!

3191
02:31:55,060 --> 02:31:56,360
You guys, please!

3192
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:57,820
I'm serious!

3193
02:31:58,120 --> 02:32:00,560
This is the dumbest bit ever!

3194
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:02,060
It's not worth...

3195
02:32:02,060 --> 02:32:03,840
It's not worth sending this!

3196
02:32:06,040 --> 02:32:06,520
It's not worth sending this!

3197
02:32:06,520 --> 02:32:06,880
Okay...

3198
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:11,220
I'm going to continue on moving forward.

3199
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:12,340
Okay, everybody.

3200
02:32:12,440 --> 02:32:13,880
We're moving forward with our afterlives.

3201
02:32:15,300 --> 02:32:17,720
Oh, I'm moving forward with my afterlives!

3202
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:19,700
I can't tell who's winning the bid war at this point!

3203
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:20,380
Me either!

3204
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:22,360
Okay...

3205
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:26,280
If I sell this Ice Monkey and put him in the middle of the field...

3206
02:32:26,280 --> 02:32:27,840
Where he will be absolutely useless...

3207
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:31,040
Will you guys feel better?

3208
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:33,400
So then I technically sold him.

3209
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:35,100
And I bought another one.

3210
02:32:35,740 --> 02:32:37,140
Buy, buy, buy.

3211
02:32:37,380 --> 02:32:38,880
Ice, ice, ice.

3212
02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:46,140
Do it.

3213
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:48,020
No, don't sell.

3214
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:50,320
Zero, zero, zero in the middle.

3215
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:51,720
He'll be the mascot.

3216
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:54,160
But I can't hurt anybody.

3217
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:00,720
Ice, ice.

3218
02:33:01,580 --> 02:33:01,920
Baby.

3219
02:33:18,970 --> 02:33:19,650
Sweet.

3220
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:22,770
I feel like I lost in the end.

3221
02:33:24,130 --> 02:33:25,790
I feel like...

3222
02:33:25,790 --> 02:33:28,530
I feel like I just got bullied.

3223
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:32,270
Into this.

3224
02:33:39,350 --> 02:33:40,870
Oh my gosh.

3225
02:33:41,410 --> 02:33:42,770
Ballistic missile.

3226
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:47,090
Holy cow.

3227
02:33:58,420 --> 02:34:02,440
Membership lapsed midstream, so I was jarringly not green.

3228
02:34:02,620 --> 02:34:03,540
Here's extra.

3229
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:06,480
I don't need extra, but thank you.

3230
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:20,200
I got two monkey bucks.

3231
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:22,900
Yippee!

3232
02:34:27,980 --> 02:34:29,940
Gonna join the 30s gang on Tuesday.

3233
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:33,000
Could you sing me a happy birthday song in a granny voice with love, Bozo?

3234
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:37,920
Happy birthday to you.

3235
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:40,020
Happy birthday.

3236
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:41,940
Young man.

3237
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:43,700
Happy birthday.

3238
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:46,100
Dear Bozo.

3239
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:48,540
Happy birthday.

3240
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:50,120
To you.

3241
02:34:55,980 --> 02:34:57,960
Let's get the berserker brew after this.

3242
02:34:58,220 --> 02:34:59,260
I am Quincy.

3243
02:34:59,420 --> 02:35:00,760
Son of Quincy.

3244
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:06,950
I didn't know he said son of Quincy like that.

3245
02:35:08,290 --> 02:35:09,450
I am Quincy.

3246
02:35:10,190 --> 02:35:11,130
Oh no.

3247
02:35:11,170 --> 02:35:12,170
He has an upgrade.

3248
02:35:14,490 --> 02:35:16,630
Ice Monkey wins by doing nothing.

3249
02:35:16,850 --> 02:35:17,590
This is crazy.

3250
02:35:18,530 --> 02:35:19,810
I am Quincy.

3251
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:21,670
Son of Quincy.

3252
02:35:23,350 --> 02:35:25,110
Ice Monkey has an upgrade.

3253
02:35:28,310 --> 02:35:28,870
I

3254
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:40,420
don't even remember what this does.

3255
02:35:40,960 --> 02:35:42,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

3256
02:35:50,170 --> 02:35:51,830
He's just juggling in the middle.

3257
02:35:54,150 --> 02:35:55,410
I am Quincy.

3258
02:35:55,550 --> 02:35:56,670
Son of Quincy.

3259
02:35:57,250 --> 02:35:57,690
Okay.

3260
02:35:59,110 --> 02:36:00,390
I can post this here.

3261
02:36:01,770 --> 02:36:03,910
If I put it right in the middle...

3262
02:36:04,490 --> 02:36:06,590
Can I still put monkeys on the side?

3263
02:36:07,710 --> 02:36:09,250
Like a ninja monkey around?

3264
02:36:09,710 --> 02:36:10,590
Oh my gosh.

3265
02:36:10,650 --> 02:36:13,230
Can I put this in the middle and decorate it with ninja monkeys?

3266
02:36:19,170 --> 02:36:20,050
Can I put this in the middle and decorate it with ninja monkeys?

3267
02:36:20,050 --> 02:36:20,270
No.

3268
02:36:21,050 --> 02:36:22,070
Not the last loop.

3269
02:36:22,130 --> 02:36:22,670
This loop instead.

3270
02:36:26,010 --> 02:36:26,450
Okay.

3271
02:36:26,570 --> 02:36:26,650
So, I am Quincy.

3272
02:36:26,650 --> 02:36:27,030
This is Samson.

3273
02:36:27,130 --> 02:36:30,030
Samson is really adamant about it.

3274
02:36:30,950 --> 02:36:31,850
It won't fit.

3275
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:32,490
Are you sure?

3276
02:36:32,850 --> 02:36:33,130
Wait.

3277
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:33,430
Hold on.

3278
02:36:33,570 --> 02:36:35,250
I can't afford anything anymore.

3279
02:36:35,310 --> 02:36:35,550
Hold on.

3280
02:36:36,410 --> 02:36:38,310
But we need these guys to level up too.

3281
02:36:40,330 --> 02:36:42,550
We need these guys to get more experience also.

3282
02:36:44,410 --> 02:36:44,850
Ha!

3283
02:36:48,580 --> 02:36:49,460
What was...

3284
02:36:49,460 --> 02:36:50,720
So it was...

3285
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:56,020
Magic shots last longer and seek out the bloons even behind cover.

3286
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:58,400
Pop through two layers.

3287
02:36:59,040 --> 02:36:59,620
Oh no.

3288
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:00,580
I want the wall of fire.

3289
02:37:01,100 --> 02:37:01,720
I think.

3290
02:37:01,860 --> 02:37:02,980
We'll do the wall of fire.

3291
02:37:05,380 --> 02:37:05,740
Fireball.

3292
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:16,160
I'm sorry.

3293
02:37:16,260 --> 02:37:17,020
I'm just enthusiastic.

3294
02:37:17,460 --> 02:37:17,820
It's okay.

3295
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:18,980
Just try not to spam too much.

3296
02:37:21,820 --> 02:37:23,760
But I'm asking for help from you guys so...

3297
02:37:24,460 --> 02:37:25,540
I don't mind...

3298
02:37:27,160 --> 02:37:28,380
the backseating a little bit.

3299
02:37:29,460 --> 02:37:30,040
But...

3300
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:30,500
But...

3301
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:31,240
But...

3302
02:37:31,240 --> 02:37:32,320
But...

3303
02:37:39,630 --> 02:37:42,170
I'm gonna do actually the stronger acid.

3304
02:37:42,550 --> 02:37:45,050
Because I remember someone saying the acid pool is not as good.

3305
02:37:45,930 --> 02:37:46,910
So we'll do that.

3306
02:37:48,050 --> 02:37:48,570
But...

3307
02:37:49,240 --> 02:37:50,030
You want some?

3308
02:37:50,390 --> 02:37:51,630
You want some?

3309
02:37:56,910 --> 02:37:58,990
Ice Monkey standing center.

3310
02:37:59,270 --> 02:38:00,870
He's like...

3311
02:38:01,780 --> 02:38:03,710
And then when we win he juggles.

3312
02:38:03,810 --> 02:38:04,810
It's so awesome.

3313
02:38:06,030 --> 02:38:06,430
Hahaha.

3314
02:38:07,330 --> 02:38:08,690
My favorite intern.

3315
02:38:08,850 --> 02:38:09,230
Yay!

3316
02:38:09,410 --> 02:38:10,550
Juggle monkey juggle.

3317
02:38:10,930 --> 02:38:11,430
Hahaha.

3318
02:38:12,770 --> 02:38:15,110
David thanks for the five gifted.

3319
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:15,770
Hahaha.

3320
02:38:18,370 --> 02:38:20,670
I'm barely taking this one seriously.

3321
02:38:20,890 --> 02:38:22,210
I can barely concentrate.

3322
02:38:22,610 --> 02:38:23,090
Hahaha.

3323
02:38:24,290 --> 02:38:25,990
I can barely concentrate.

3324
02:38:28,070 --> 02:38:29,290
He's so cute.

3325
02:38:29,590 --> 02:38:30,370
He's really cute.

3326
02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:31,890
He's pretty cute.

3327
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:34,150
He's pretty cute.

3328
02:38:34,150 --> 02:38:35,470
He's pretty cute.

3329
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:44,040
He's really cute.

3330
02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:47,480
Why is it so hard to place this?

3331
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:47,940
Why is it so hard to place this?

3332
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:48,560
Like... what the hell?

3333
02:38:49,560 --> 02:38:50,560
Like... what the hell?

3334
02:38:59,740 --> 02:39:01,960
Hi ice monkey got me distracted too.

3335
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:02,460
Hi ice monkey got me distracted too.

3336
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:04,220
Monkey farms?

3337
02:39:04,400 --> 02:39:04,960
You're right.

3338
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:10,470
Oh this has an upgrade.

3339
02:39:11,150 --> 02:39:12,910
We're gonna go for the faster production.

3340
02:39:16,410 --> 02:39:17,450
We're gonna go for the faster production.

3341
02:39:18,730 --> 02:39:21,570
Okay, I have no money, so...

3342
02:39:21,570 --> 02:39:25,150
Look at the way he juggles so fast!

3343
02:39:27,190 --> 02:39:28,350
Juggle, juggle monkey!

3344
02:39:28,850 --> 02:39:29,950
Juggle ice monkey!

3345
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:44,340
Darksider, welcome to Bamboo Ship!

3346
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:45,180
Thank you so much!

3347
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:45,820
Thank you!

3348
02:39:46,820 --> 02:39:47,860
Holy cow!

3349
02:39:49,820 --> 02:39:53,000
I think I was going for banana...

3350
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,540
You want banana?

3351
02:39:54,780 --> 02:39:55,580
We have banana!

3352
02:39:56,400 --> 02:39:57,440
Banana crates?

3353
02:39:57,520 --> 02:39:58,500
We're 300 each!

3354
02:40:09,970 --> 02:40:10,490
Nice!

3355
02:40:12,210 --> 02:40:13,470
Wall of fire!

3356
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:15,430
Nice!

3357
02:40:15,970 --> 02:40:17,090
This one is $10.

3358
02:40:17,210 --> 02:40:18,390
Wow, he looks so cool!

3359
02:40:19,090 --> 02:40:20,250
Okay, I need more money.

3360
02:40:20,930 --> 02:40:23,070
Oh, pop it, pop it, pop it!

3361
02:40:23,210 --> 02:40:25,150
Pop the golden cup!

3362
02:40:25,850 --> 02:40:27,550
Pop it, pop it, pop it!

3363
02:40:29,510 --> 02:40:30,030
Yippee!

3364
02:40:33,090 --> 02:40:33,870
Okay, nice.

3365
02:40:36,330 --> 02:40:37,710
It's also the banana bank.

3366
02:40:38,030 --> 02:40:38,750
Which one is that?

3367
02:40:39,270 --> 02:40:41,310
The Wall Street one?

3368
02:40:44,470 --> 02:40:48,690
Pub of Monkey Trades earns colossal income, generates lives each round.

3369
02:40:49,130 --> 02:40:49,650
What?!

3370
02:40:52,550 --> 02:40:53,870
Two more dollars!

3371
02:40:54,230 --> 02:40:57,330
Hey, two dollars is two dollars that I did not spend with my real money.

3372
02:40:59,630 --> 02:41:00,510
Even faster!

3373
02:41:05,970 --> 02:41:06,990
Bank is the middle.

3374
02:41:07,610 --> 02:41:08,410
Monkey-nomics?

3375
02:41:10,310 --> 02:41:14,650
All money generated in this farm is now stored in the bank and earns 15%... Oh!

3376
02:41:16,530 --> 02:41:18,050
I see, I see, I see.

3377
02:41:18,870 --> 02:41:19,970
Okay, I'll do another one.

3378
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:25,000
And we'll go for the middle path.

3379
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:29,980
Gold balloon for you.

3380
02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:30,800
Oh, thank you!

3381
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:33,700
Mr. Wow, welcome to membership.

3382
02:41:33,860 --> 02:41:34,800
Thank you so much!

3383
02:41:36,700 --> 02:41:38,900
This map is making me wish it was fall.

3384
02:41:39,280 --> 02:41:40,300
Okay, uh-oh.

3385
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:45,420
I just realized, we have a lot of balloons getting through.

3386
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:48,680
Watch out for the MOAB.

3387
02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:50,760
We have a lot of balloons getting through.

3388
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:52,080
I think we're in trouble.

3389
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:56,500
I think we're a bit in trouble.

3390
02:41:59,820 --> 02:42:02,580
We'll do the wall of fire at least, and even the faster production.

3391
02:42:03,740 --> 02:42:05,140
Ding ding ding ding!

3392
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:08,700
What's this one?

3393
02:42:08,780 --> 02:42:11,040
Collect the radius of bananas is larger.

3394
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:18,420
Uncollect the bananas, auto-collect.

3395
02:42:24,010 --> 02:42:25,110
Nah, I'd rather have more.

3396
02:42:27,430 --> 02:42:28,290
Nah, you'd win?

3397
02:42:28,410 --> 02:42:28,750
Really?

3398
02:42:31,730 --> 02:42:33,230
Did you play this on stream with Mata?

3399
02:42:33,470 --> 02:42:38,630
Actually, I would love to if she wants to, but I think we might be like, put this monkey here.

3400
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:40,150
No, put this monkey here!

3401
02:42:40,410 --> 02:42:41,830
Is engineer monkey good?

3402
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:46,330
Maybe we should get him too.

3403
02:42:47,070 --> 02:42:48,230
I haven't used him once.

3404
02:42:48,850 --> 02:42:50,630
And I haven't really used the druid monkey.

3405
02:42:50,750 --> 02:42:51,710
Oh, I have a little bit.

3406
02:42:52,490 --> 02:42:53,210
I lied.

3407
02:42:53,390 --> 02:42:54,390
I lied, I lied.

3408
02:42:55,430 --> 02:42:56,190
Yeah, he's good.

3409
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:03,080
Engineer gaming?

3410
02:43:03,340 --> 02:43:03,560
Okay.

3411
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:05,460
If I put him like here.

3412
02:43:06,980 --> 02:43:10,960
Kind of as like a defense at the end of the, you know, the end of the...

3413
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:15,060
The end of the line.

3414
02:43:17,700 --> 02:43:19,160
Top path engineer goaded.

3415
02:43:20,260 --> 02:43:21,140
With the sentry.

3416
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:23,120
That's the one I was looking at, cause it kinda seems fun.

3417
02:43:25,160 --> 02:43:27,380
Removes camo and regrow and pops left.

3418
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:27,880
Wow.

3419
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:32,900
Engineer puts more gun.

3420
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:34,080
I love gun!

3421
02:43:35,740 --> 02:43:37,940
But how far do they reach, you know?

3422
02:43:49,660 --> 02:43:50,680
Bottom's good for money.

3423
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:52,780
I think we're good for money right now.

3424
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:54,960
Hmm.

3425
02:43:55,620 --> 02:43:56,620
A decent range?

3426
02:43:56,860 --> 02:43:58,660
So I don't have to put him right here then.

3427
02:43:58,840 --> 02:43:59,940
I could put him like here.

3428
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:04,220
And he's kinda like, building his little sentries and they're like

3429
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:12,470
average range.

3430
02:44:12,670 --> 02:44:13,670
Put them where Quincy is.

3431
02:44:13,810 --> 02:44:14,070
Oh, okay.

3432
02:44:16,010 --> 02:44:16,550
Like here.

3433
02:44:16,670 --> 02:44:17,770
So here actually then.

3434
02:44:19,650 --> 02:44:20,450
Yeah, basically.

3435
02:44:20,810 --> 02:44:21,970
Not that much of a range.

3436
02:44:22,090 --> 02:44:22,170
Okay.

3437
02:44:24,430 --> 02:44:31,450
He'll build in his range, but the sentries can shoot wherever, right?

3438
02:44:33,070 --> 02:44:36,910
Or the sentries can only shoot in the little circle that he's in, is what I'm asking.

3439
02:44:46,460 --> 02:44:48,680
Oh, he gets the buff here, so.

3440
02:44:49,700 --> 02:44:50,760
Sentries have their own range.

3441
02:44:50,940 --> 02:44:52,180
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3442
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:55,860
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3443
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:58,480
Can become huge with the middle one.

3444
02:45:00,400 --> 02:45:01,120
Longer range.

3445
02:45:03,320 --> 02:45:06,580
I wish sometimes you could like, I wish sometimes it wasn't just a circle.

3446
02:45:06,900 --> 02:45:08,060
Like I wish I could make a rectangle.

3447
02:45:08,660 --> 02:45:09,260
You know.

3448
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:13,340
Circles in this game are so hard.

3449
02:45:15,860 --> 02:45:17,220
How you doing Ice Monkey?

3450
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:22,100
Are you working hard or are you hardly working?

3451
02:45:25,940 --> 02:45:26,460
You know what?

3452
02:45:26,480 --> 02:45:31,840
I don't have any snipers, so let's add a sniper right here.

3453
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:36,560
Right here.

3454
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:38,960
Actually, okay, hold on.

3455
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:40,420
How do I want to do this?

3456
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:42,980
Because I also want to add a village.

3457
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:44,980
We can put the village in the middle.

3458
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,880
Like right here and sniper monkeys and then some guys down here probably.

3459
02:45:53,840 --> 02:45:54,460
Incoming!

3460
02:45:55,820 --> 02:45:57,280
Oh, we're fine.

3461
02:45:58,120 --> 02:45:59,020
I think.

3462
02:46:00,940 --> 02:46:01,560
Yeah.

3463
02:46:01,720 --> 02:46:02,240
Alright.

3464
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:05,340
Yeah, we're fine.

3465
02:46:05,360 --> 02:46:06,180
We're fine.

3466
02:46:06,340 --> 02:46:06,720
We're fine.

3467
02:46:08,340 --> 02:46:10,080
I need more money.

3468
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:21,580
Alright.

3469
02:46:22,640 --> 02:46:23,260
Alright.

3470
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:30,120
It's like the dune.

3471
02:46:30,300 --> 02:46:31,880
It's like the dune popcorn.

3472
02:46:35,020 --> 02:46:35,420
Right?

3473
02:46:36,560 --> 02:46:37,140
Just me?

3474
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:38,640
Okay.

3475
02:46:39,560 --> 02:46:39,960
Yeah.

3476
02:46:42,340 --> 02:46:46,160
I'm going to do bigger because I don't think I need to reach longer.

3477
02:46:46,300 --> 02:46:46,820
I think we're okay.

3478
02:46:47,460 --> 02:46:48,580
Let's do bigger stacks.

3479
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:51,080
Actually, no, I'm going to hold out.

3480
02:46:58,440 --> 02:46:59,400
Why are you saying ha?

3481
02:47:03,170 --> 02:47:04,190
What are you saying ha for?

3482
02:47:06,130 --> 02:47:07,650
It looks just like it, I think.

3483
02:47:10,990 --> 02:47:11,790
Holy moly!

3484
02:47:11,870 --> 02:47:12,530
We have so much money!

3485
02:47:14,190 --> 02:47:15,850
I wish I could upgrade you.

3486
02:47:16,930 --> 02:47:17,550
Close though.

3487
02:47:17,590 --> 02:47:17,830
We're close.

3488
02:47:18,630 --> 02:47:19,050
Let's see.

3489
02:47:19,130 --> 02:47:19,390
What else?

3490
02:47:19,610 --> 02:47:21,650
Um, stronger stimulant.

3491
02:47:22,630 --> 02:47:23,030
Whoa!

3492
02:47:25,210 --> 02:47:25,610
Shimmer.

3493
02:47:31,530 --> 02:47:32,350
Yeah, I know.

3494
02:47:33,270 --> 02:47:34,830
I am Quincy.

3495
02:47:34,830 --> 02:47:36,530
Son of Quincy.

3496
02:47:37,110 --> 02:47:39,190
Let's go for the MOAB here.

3497
02:47:39,670 --> 02:47:44,570
And I'm going to actually do faster firing because we have the intent of building a village right there.

3498
02:47:44,710 --> 02:47:45,090
So...

3499
02:47:47,350 --> 02:47:48,850
Don't necessarily need

3500
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:55,040
currently.

3501
02:47:58,840 --> 02:48:00,380
Spend it all on ice monkey.

3502
02:48:01,440 --> 02:48:02,580
We're rich baby!

3503
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:03,460
Woohoo!

3504
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:07,100
I just need them to generate a little.

3505
02:48:07,260 --> 02:48:07,600
Oh wait!

3506
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:11,360
Oh!

3507
02:48:11,360 --> 02:48:14,540
I can still do the same thing even though we're taking different paths with each one of them.

3508
02:48:15,220 --> 02:48:16,280
I just realized.

3509
02:48:21,750 --> 02:48:22,670
Oh yeah!

3510
02:48:23,110 --> 02:48:24,390
That's what I'm talking about.

3511
02:48:29,180 --> 02:48:30,960
I think your spikes are stale.

3512
02:48:31,180 --> 02:48:31,660
What?

3513
02:48:33,260 --> 02:48:34,380
Why do you think that?

3514
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:43,020
They're actually really great!

3515
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:45,460
Monkey bank!

3516
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:46,120
Monkey bank!

3517
02:48:46,540 --> 02:48:47,600
Monkey bank!

3518
02:48:49,380 --> 02:48:50,320
Monkey bank!

3519
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:51,480
Monkey bank!

3520
02:48:52,780 --> 02:48:55,020
Middle path druid is very broken.

3521
02:48:55,400 --> 02:48:56,100
This guy?

3522
02:48:57,240 --> 02:48:57,760
Really?

3523
02:48:57,860 --> 02:48:59,040
I always go for the top one.

3524
02:49:02,620 --> 02:49:03,140
Dang!

3525
02:49:03,180 --> 02:49:04,700
He generates a life and cash?

3526
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:13,800
But see this one like the druid this one it only he only gets one balloon at a time.

3527
02:49:15,160 --> 02:49:15,640
Risotto!

3528
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:16,700
Welcome to membership.

3529
02:49:16,840 --> 02:49:17,240
Thank you!

3530
02:49:17,500 --> 02:49:18,180
Middle is OP.

3531
02:49:18,840 --> 02:49:19,320
Okay.

3532
02:49:19,400 --> 02:49:20,000
We'll add him.

3533
02:49:21,580 --> 02:49:22,420
Let's try him out.

3534
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:24,000
Rise!

3535
02:49:28,040 --> 02:49:28,980
We'll put you right.

3536
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:29,720
Look at him waving.

3537
02:49:33,140 --> 02:49:34,140
He's strong trust.

3538
02:49:35,900 --> 02:49:36,960
Next to the bank?

3539
02:49:37,280 --> 02:49:37,960
Like here?

3540
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:38,280
Wait.

3541
02:49:38,480 --> 02:49:39,560
What is the upgrade?

3542
02:49:39,800 --> 02:49:40,680
I'm confused now.

3543
02:49:41,100 --> 02:49:45,300
Generates cash each use plus extra cash per banana farm!

3544
02:49:45,580 --> 02:49:47,080
Oh my god!

3545
02:49:47,300 --> 02:49:49,260
Wait does this count as near?

3546
02:49:54,140 --> 02:49:54,720
Let's go!

3547
02:49:59,750 --> 02:50:02,510
Oh the open buffs the druid.

3548
02:50:02,630 --> 02:50:04,070
I do remember that actually.

3549
02:50:04,670 --> 02:50:05,590
Give us money.

3550
02:50:08,770 --> 02:50:09,310
Wow!

3551
02:50:09,570 --> 02:50:11,010
He got rid of all of those.

3552
02:50:11,050 --> 02:50:11,730
That was really crazy.

3553
02:50:14,190 --> 02:50:14,590
Oh yeah!

3554
02:50:16,450 --> 02:50:17,610
Good job Quincy.

3555
02:50:17,650 --> 02:50:18,230
Son of Quincy.

3556
02:50:18,890 --> 02:50:19,810
I'm doing deadly.

3557
02:50:19,970 --> 02:50:21,310
I'm doing the precision with this one.

3558
02:50:21,770 --> 02:50:25,010
Oh I should have I should have bought the monkey bank.

3559
02:50:25,170 --> 02:50:25,510
But that's okay.

3560
02:50:26,230 --> 02:50:27,470
What are you doing anyway?

3561
02:50:39,340 --> 02:50:40,140
Welcome to membership.

3562
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:41,480
Thank you so much.

3563
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:42,900
Thank you.

3564
02:50:42,940 --> 02:50:43,200
Thank you.

3565
02:50:43,200 --> 02:50:43,620
Thank you.

3566
02:50:43,980 --> 02:50:45,600
Okay we need jungles bounty.

3567
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:47,240
Oh we're so close though.

3568
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:48,360
Awesome.

3569
02:50:50,420 --> 02:50:51,440
Go get it!

3570
02:50:51,460 --> 02:50:51,800
Get it!

3571
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:52,880
Get the crown!

3572
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:53,600
Get the crown!

3573
02:50:54,200 --> 02:50:54,440
Yeah!

3574
02:50:54,800 --> 02:50:56,140
Two real bucks.

3575
02:50:57,580 --> 02:50:58,860
We want the real bucks.

3576
02:50:59,000 --> 02:50:59,480
Monkey!

3577
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:02,120
Thanks for the 20.

3578
02:51:02,260 --> 02:51:02,940
Thank you so much.

3579
02:51:03,860 --> 02:51:04,340
Monkey!

3580
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:06,980
Monkey!

3581
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:08,080
Monkey!

3582
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:08,880
Monkey!

3583
02:51:15,060 --> 02:51:17,160
This location I feel like kind of sucks.

3584
02:51:17,360 --> 02:51:18,220
He's just really random.

3585
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:20,320
He's just randomly there.

3586
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:21,020
But that's okay too.

3587
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:29,700
Hahaha!

3588
02:51:31,540 --> 02:51:33,600
Wow he was really strangling that guy right there.

3589
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:35,280
Hayden!

3590
02:51:35,400 --> 02:51:36,840
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

3591
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:38,600
Thank you.

3592
02:51:38,680 --> 02:51:39,560
Oh my gosh!

3593
02:51:40,140 --> 02:51:41,980
I just noticed how much money we have!

3594
02:51:43,460 --> 02:51:43,940
Bank!

3595
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:44,600
Bank!

3596
02:51:44,720 --> 02:51:45,200
Bank!

3597
02:51:45,220 --> 02:51:45,680
Bank!

3598
02:51:45,780 --> 02:51:46,020
Bank!

3599
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:47,860
Wait should I do bank on both?

3600
02:51:48,440 --> 02:51:49,840
Now I'm conflicted.

3601
02:51:50,820 --> 02:51:51,300
No!

3602
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:52,300
I wanted the plantation.

3603
02:51:54,700 --> 02:51:56,460
I wanted the whole field.

3604
02:52:00,730 --> 02:52:02,850
We are making bank now baby!

3605
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:08,090
The monkeyconomy.

3606
02:52:08,710 --> 02:52:09,270
Monkeyconomy!

3607
02:52:09,930 --> 02:52:10,490
Potato!

3608
02:52:11,750 --> 02:52:13,610
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

3609
02:52:14,350 --> 02:52:14,910
Potato!

3610
02:52:15,250 --> 02:52:15,810
Potato!

3611
02:52:16,170 --> 02:52:16,650
Potato!

3612
02:52:16,930 --> 02:52:17,370
Potato!

3613
02:52:21,110 --> 02:52:22,290
He's still hitting balloons?

3614
02:52:22,730 --> 02:52:23,370
Oh my gosh!

3615
02:52:23,410 --> 02:52:23,710
You're right!

3616
02:52:23,950 --> 02:52:25,170
How is he hitting them?

3617
02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:30,040
Oh!

3618
02:52:30,460 --> 02:52:31,420
From over here!

3619
02:52:31,620 --> 02:52:32,160
That's crazy.

3620
02:52:34,560 --> 02:52:35,920
Is there anything else I can buy?

3621
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:36,560
Yeah?

3622
02:52:39,340 --> 02:52:40,720
Everything I'm waiting on upgrades.

3623
02:52:41,060 --> 02:52:41,220
Oh!

3624
02:52:41,240 --> 02:52:41,820
Except you.

3625
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:49,880
Okay maybe the spikes aren't so bad.

3626
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:50,800
Headshot!

3627
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:52,320
Hahaha!

3628
02:52:52,320 --> 02:52:52,760
Headshot!

3629
02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:54,360
Quincy is so obnoxious.

3630
02:52:54,700 --> 02:52:55,140
Hahaha!

3631
02:52:57,360 --> 02:52:58,240
Oh Quincy.

3632
02:52:58,980 --> 02:52:59,420
Quincy!

3633
02:52:59,480 --> 02:52:59,920
Quincy!

3634
02:52:59,960 --> 02:53:00,940
I don't like this one though.

3635
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:01,540
I don't like the next one.

3636
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:02,500
It's a $9000 loan.

3637
02:53:02,940 --> 02:53:04,340
I don't want to be owing anybody.

3638
02:53:04,780 --> 02:53:06,660
I think that's why I didn't go for the middle one.

3639
02:53:07,220 --> 02:53:08,720
But I really like this one.

3640
02:53:12,060 --> 02:53:12,860
Wizard monkey.

3641
02:53:13,640 --> 02:53:15,540
No we're still waiting on the necromancer monkey.

3642
02:53:25,490 --> 02:53:27,730
Why is there a monkey in the middle not able to do anything?

3643
02:53:28,290 --> 02:53:28,690
Why is there a monkey in the middle not able to do anything?

3644
02:53:28,690 --> 02:53:29,850
He's our mascot monkey.

3645
02:53:31,150 --> 02:53:32,250
He's mascot monkey.

3646
02:53:32,410 --> 02:53:33,090
He doesn't do anything.

3647
02:53:33,130 --> 02:53:33,810
Is that all you got?

3648
02:53:33,810 --> 02:53:34,590
Oh!

3649
02:53:35,570 --> 02:53:36,850
200 monkey money!

3650
02:53:37,710 --> 02:53:38,710
Holy cow!

3651
02:53:40,110 --> 02:53:41,330
That's a lot of monkey money.

3652
02:53:43,070 --> 02:53:44,670
Yeah he's just there to be cute.

3653
02:53:44,890 --> 02:53:46,010
He doesn't have to do anything.

3654
02:53:47,390 --> 02:53:49,610
What is something else that I need to level up?

3655
02:53:49,990 --> 02:53:52,710
I haven't really used super monkey all that much.

3656
02:53:54,050 --> 02:53:54,850
I haven't really used super monkey all that much.

3657
02:53:54,850 --> 02:53:56,150
Oh we were going to do engineer monkey.

3658
02:53:56,550 --> 02:53:57,210
Oh we were going to do engineer monkey.

3659
02:53:57,810 --> 02:54:01,290
In fact we were going to do sentry engineer.

3660
02:54:01,650 --> 02:54:01,790
In fact we were going to do sentry engineer.

3661
02:54:03,530 --> 02:54:05,130
We're just going to put him right up there.

3662
02:54:05,690 --> 02:54:07,030
Alright go monkey!

3663
02:54:13,580 --> 02:54:14,100
Moab!

3664
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:15,320
Handle it!

3665
02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:20,100
Reach...

3666
02:54:20,820 --> 02:54:22,700
10% attack speed for...

3667
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:26,460
Maybe I'll just do this one.

3668
02:54:30,500 --> 02:54:31,300
Close though.

3669
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:31,640
Close.

3670
02:54:40,300 --> 02:54:41,160
Oh my gosh!

3671
02:54:41,240 --> 02:54:42,180
We have money in here!

3672
02:54:44,320 --> 02:54:45,000
Alright!

3673
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:46,700
Alright indeed!

3674
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:54,360
Quincy's dead father is available as a redeemable item in this shop.

3675
02:54:54,780 --> 02:54:56,400
That's so messed up!

3676
02:54:57,160 --> 02:54:58,120
Wait what?

3677
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:02,280
Alright!

3678
02:55:03,340 --> 02:55:05,040
Don't forget to collect your bank money.

3679
02:55:05,160 --> 02:55:08,040
But if it's stuff in the bank doesn't it like...

3680
02:55:10,300 --> 02:55:12,060
Earns 15% interest.

3681
02:55:12,760 --> 02:55:13,480
Earns 15% interest.

3682
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:16,140
We should wait until we get it up to 9000 right?

3683
02:55:18,720 --> 02:55:20,140
It's Quincy senior.

3684
02:55:23,220 --> 02:55:24,940
What is this game?

3685
02:55:26,520 --> 02:55:27,100
Nice!

3686
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:28,100
We got the shredder.

3687
02:55:30,060 --> 02:55:31,220
Yeah shredder.

3688
02:55:33,230 --> 02:55:33,740
What next?

3689
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:36,520
Actually I'm going to add another sniper monkey.

3690
02:55:38,100 --> 02:55:39,480
Oh actually no no.

3691
02:55:39,560 --> 02:55:39,960
No no no.

3692
02:55:40,060 --> 02:55:40,380
Sorry.

3693
02:55:40,380 --> 02:55:40,520
Sorry.

3694
02:55:44,260 --> 02:55:45,160
Put you here.

3695
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:47,200
And then another sniper monkey.

3696
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:48,480
Right next to you.

3697
02:55:49,400 --> 02:55:50,680
So you... okay.

3698
02:55:52,400 --> 02:55:53,400
Will become...

3699
02:55:53,970 --> 02:55:55,000
The monkey business.

3700
02:55:56,220 --> 02:55:57,260
And bigger radius.

3701
02:55:59,680 --> 02:56:01,760
And then we can also put monkeys down here.

3702
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:03,160
That will be able to...

3703
02:56:03,160 --> 02:56:05,560
And so these guys can become like...

3704
02:56:05,560 --> 02:56:07,520
This guy can be our fast monkey.

3705
02:56:07,900 --> 02:56:09,460
The fastest monkey in the west.

3706
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:12,540
Get it!

3707
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:14,240
Get it!

3708
02:56:16,580 --> 02:56:18,120
Two monkey bucks.

3709
02:56:21,060 --> 02:56:22,920
How's our little engineer guy doing?

3710
02:56:24,400 --> 02:56:26,380
I don't even know what he's doing.

3711
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:29,000
He's killed 141.

3712
02:56:29,100 --> 02:56:29,580
You want some?

3713
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:31,080
You want some?

3714
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:34,760
This guy is...

3715
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:36,240
The druid is cracked.

3716
02:56:41,680 --> 02:56:42,360
Incoming!

3717
02:56:42,660 --> 02:56:43,460
What's this do?

3718
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:45,760
You can all have some.

3719
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:47,980
Headshot.

3720
02:56:48,540 --> 02:56:49,540
You want some?

3721
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:51,640
You can all have some.

3722
02:56:52,840 --> 02:56:53,800
I can't.

3723
02:56:53,800 --> 02:56:54,380
I can't.

3724
02:56:55,120 --> 02:56:57,000
The engineer is a pain in the butt to level.

3725
02:56:57,340 --> 02:56:58,600
Well that's why he's here.

3726
02:56:58,860 --> 02:56:59,300
Oh my god.

3727
02:56:59,340 --> 02:57:00,580
She's killing nothing.

3728
02:57:01,860 --> 02:57:03,500
You can lower Quincy's voice.

3729
02:57:03,720 --> 02:57:04,960
No I turned it up on purpose.

3730
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:07,400
Because I think it's kind of funny.

3731
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:21,560
Something sounds wet and I don't know what it is.

3732
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:23,000
What's that wet sound?

3733
02:57:30,950 --> 02:57:31,510
I don't know.

3734
02:57:31,510 --> 02:57:31,690
Also...

3735
02:57:31,690 --> 02:57:33,470
Oh let's get the boat in here too.

3736
02:57:33,610 --> 02:57:34,070
Oh my gosh wait!

3737
02:57:34,190 --> 02:57:35,990
I only have two rounds left.

3738
02:57:37,130 --> 02:57:39,470
I think I meant to put the boat in sooner.

3739
02:57:40,010 --> 02:57:41,170
I completely forgot.

3740
02:57:44,170 --> 02:57:44,850
My bad.

3741
02:57:45,130 --> 02:57:45,690
Oh well.

3742
02:57:49,170 --> 02:57:50,570
Oh is the alchemist doing it?

3743
02:57:50,670 --> 02:57:50,970
Probably.

3744
02:57:57,980 --> 02:57:58,760
There he comes.

3745
02:57:59,740 --> 02:58:00,720
I can hear him.

3746
02:58:02,460 --> 02:58:03,460
Oh my gosh.

3747
02:58:03,480 --> 02:58:03,980
It broke?

3748
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:06,720
They destroyed it off stream.

3749
02:58:07,120 --> 02:58:08,280
Or off the screen.

3750
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:13,580
Free play!

3751
02:58:16,460 --> 02:58:17,600
Oh man.

3752
02:58:18,180 --> 02:58:20,800
Buccaneer I forgot to put you in.

3753
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:23,140
And now it's going to take forever to get you leveled up.

3754
02:58:35,310 --> 02:58:36,070
Let's see.

3755
02:58:36,270 --> 02:58:36,350
Yeah.

3756
02:58:37,310 --> 02:58:38,130
Let's just keep going.

3757
02:58:39,510 --> 02:58:40,730
Is that all you got?

3758
02:58:41,010 --> 02:58:42,230
Is that all you got?

3759
02:58:47,650 --> 02:58:48,490
Oh yeah.

3760
02:58:49,550 --> 02:58:51,530
I like the way he's like squeezing them.

3761
02:58:53,170 --> 02:58:54,170
With the vines.

3762
02:58:57,410 --> 02:58:59,230
That makes me almost want to restart.

3763
02:58:59,490 --> 02:59:01,030
Because I want the nature's bounty.

3764
02:59:01,130 --> 02:59:02,310
I want the bounty man.

3765
02:59:02,670 --> 02:59:03,590
Check the bank too.

3766
02:59:03,690 --> 02:59:04,990
We still have a good amount in here.

3767
02:59:05,370 --> 02:59:05,930
You know what?

3768
02:59:05,930 --> 02:59:06,810
I'll collect it at this point.

3769
02:59:08,910 --> 02:59:10,110
14,000.

3770
02:59:10,110 --> 02:59:10,190
14,000.

3771
02:59:11,210 --> 02:59:12,210
Heck yeah.

3772
02:59:12,670 --> 02:59:14,110
Wish I could buy experience.

3773
02:59:14,710 --> 02:59:16,190
I mean you can with real money.

3774
02:59:16,370 --> 02:59:18,470
But I wish I could with my monkey bucks.

3775
02:59:22,570 --> 02:59:25,890
For 5,000 monkey xp it's one dollar.

3776
02:59:27,070 --> 02:59:27,790
For 5,000 monkey xp it's one dollar.

3777
02:59:29,830 --> 02:59:31,310
One dollar USD.

3778
02:59:32,190 --> 02:59:33,390
One dollar USD.

3779
02:59:37,220 --> 02:59:39,220
7k might be max in an unboosted bank.

3780
02:59:39,380 --> 02:59:40,740
7k might be max in an unboosted bank.

3781
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:48,160
Just play the game.

3782
02:59:49,420 --> 02:59:50,460
There's no rush.

3783
02:59:50,720 --> 02:59:51,100
Right?

3784
02:59:51,300 --> 02:59:52,980
I guess if you're really impatient.

3785
02:59:53,700 --> 02:59:55,420
Mr. Alphaisy.

3786
02:59:55,420 --> 02:59:56,700
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

3787
02:59:56,800 --> 02:59:57,900
Thank you so much.

3788
03:00:00,640 --> 03:00:02,220
If it was zero dollars.

3789
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:03,160
I'd buy.

3790
03:00:08,290 --> 03:00:09,590
Mint do you want a dollar?

3791
03:00:09,930 --> 03:00:10,490
No.

3792
03:00:13,610 --> 03:00:14,170
No.

3793
03:00:14,270 --> 03:00:14,830
No.

3794
03:00:16,550 --> 03:00:17,110
No.

3795
03:00:31,360 --> 03:00:33,320
Our monkey village.

3796
03:00:34,740 --> 03:00:37,100
Radius gets tier 1 upgrades for free.

3797
03:00:37,220 --> 03:00:38,100
For free.

3798
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,800
Increased range and reduced ability cooldowns.

3799
03:00:44,200 --> 03:00:46,440
What if you sold Ice Monkey for a dollar?

3800
03:00:46,620 --> 03:00:47,720
Ice Monkey is priceless.

3801
03:00:49,620 --> 03:00:51,140
Ice Monkey is priceless.

3802
03:00:51,240 --> 03:00:51,800
What do you mean?

3803
03:00:56,200 --> 03:00:58,320
I'm going to buy a monkey.

3804
03:00:58,320 --> 03:00:59,760
I think we can use him.

3805
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:01,200
I don't know what else to add.

3806
03:01:02,220 --> 03:01:03,600
I think I'm invincible.

3807
03:01:04,560 --> 03:01:05,980
I do like Gatlin Monkey.

3808
03:01:06,100 --> 03:01:09,760
Actually Gatlin Monkey would be kind of great here in the middle.

3809
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:12,160
Gatlin Monkey and...

3810
03:01:13,900 --> 03:01:17,000
Actually I like putting Gatlin Monkey facing right there.

3811
03:01:18,160 --> 03:01:19,160
Oh my gosh.

3812
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:20,780
Thank you guys for the super chats.

3813
03:01:21,860 --> 03:01:22,200
Woohoo.

3814
03:01:23,960 --> 03:01:25,040
Add a plane.

3815
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:26,880
Yeah.

3816
03:01:26,980 --> 03:01:28,100
I think I will.

3817
03:01:28,620 --> 03:01:31,400
No I don't have them upgraded at all.

3818
03:01:31,780 --> 03:01:33,200
I have used them.

3819
03:01:33,340 --> 03:01:34,320
But not very much.

3820
03:01:35,680 --> 03:01:36,180
Hmmm.

3821
03:01:42,060 --> 03:01:43,940
Hit camels and do more damage.

3822
03:01:44,180 --> 03:01:44,400
Yeah.

3823
03:01:47,510 --> 03:01:48,970
Dark Storm is OP.

3824
03:01:49,110 --> 03:01:50,730
Not everything can be OP you guys.

3825
03:01:52,070 --> 03:01:53,230
This is goaded.

3826
03:01:53,350 --> 03:01:54,250
This is goaded.

3827
03:01:54,250 --> 03:01:55,570
This is goaded.

3828
03:01:58,790 --> 03:01:59,370
Pineapple.

3829
03:01:59,930 --> 03:02:00,510
Wait.

3830
03:02:00,990 --> 03:02:02,290
I'm so sorry Kiara.

3831
03:02:20,210 --> 03:02:22,110
My Gatlin I have...

3832
03:02:22,110 --> 03:02:23,910
Oh that's not a Gatlin Monkey.

3833
03:02:24,170 --> 03:02:25,090
I have a...

3834
03:02:25,090 --> 03:02:26,570
I was working on the top one.

3835
03:02:29,810 --> 03:02:30,390
Because...

3836
03:02:33,010 --> 03:02:36,350
I don't like having to swivel my own guy.

3837
03:02:36,570 --> 03:02:37,250
I don't like that.

3838
03:02:40,250 --> 03:02:42,230
So I just fixed him there.

3839
03:02:42,330 --> 03:02:43,730
And I was setting on these two.

3840
03:02:45,450 --> 03:02:45,990
You

3841
03:02:52,250 --> 03:02:52,490
know what?

3842
03:02:52,490 --> 03:02:53,350
I'm gonna set him up.

3843
03:02:54,070 --> 03:02:57,810
I'm gonna put him right next to Ice Monkey.

3844
03:02:59,150 --> 03:03:01,070
He is protecting Ice Monkey.

3845
03:03:03,150 --> 03:03:03,910
I think.

3846
03:03:06,650 --> 03:03:08,250
Locked and loaded.

3847
03:03:10,410 --> 03:03:11,210
Windle.

3848
03:03:30,460 --> 03:03:31,260
Sweet.

3849
03:03:31,580 --> 03:03:32,080
Sweet.

3850
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:36,880
Ice...

3851
03:03:36,880 --> 03:03:37,280
No.

3852
03:03:37,480 --> 03:03:39,080
Ice Monkey protect him.

3853
03:03:39,200 --> 03:03:39,800
So true.

3854
03:03:40,540 --> 03:03:41,820
So true.

3855
03:03:44,240 --> 03:03:45,040
Wow.

3856
03:03:45,560 --> 03:03:49,930
That was scary.

3857
03:03:50,450 --> 03:03:51,630
Oh it's level 63.

3858
03:03:52,030 --> 03:03:53,210
I just realized.

3859
03:03:54,050 --> 03:03:54,850
Oh.

3860
03:03:55,490 --> 03:03:56,950
You can all have some.

3861
03:03:57,190 --> 03:03:58,910
I hate him so much.

3862
03:04:01,250 --> 03:04:03,230
You can all have some.

3863
03:04:08,930 --> 03:04:09,610
Oh wait.

3864
03:04:09,670 --> 03:04:10,690
Or is this round 63?

3865
03:04:11,190 --> 03:04:11,710
Oh.

3866
03:04:11,970 --> 03:04:13,010
I think we're in trouble.

3867
03:04:13,470 --> 03:04:13,990
Okay.

3868
03:04:14,050 --> 03:04:15,650
I need to actually come up with a plan.

3869
03:04:16,950 --> 03:04:18,370
I'll take my $800.

3870
03:04:19,850 --> 03:04:20,890
And um...

3871
03:04:20,890 --> 03:04:21,770
Let's see.

3872
03:04:22,350 --> 03:04:23,810
What do I wanna add?

3873
03:04:24,270 --> 03:04:25,330
What do I wanna add?

3874
03:04:26,250 --> 03:04:26,770
Oh!

3875
03:04:27,710 --> 03:04:29,910
Oh you need to be better.

3876
03:04:30,970 --> 03:04:31,810
There we go.

3877
03:04:35,250 --> 03:04:36,010
Let's see.

3878
03:04:40,670 --> 03:04:41,230
Actually.

3879
03:04:41,290 --> 03:04:41,510
No.

3880
03:04:41,570 --> 03:04:42,090
You're first.

3881
03:04:42,790 --> 03:04:43,730
You're strongest.

3882
03:04:45,750 --> 03:04:47,050
You're locked and loaded.

3883
03:04:47,150 --> 03:04:47,410
What next?

3884
03:04:48,150 --> 03:04:50,750
Engineer Monkey is doing his best.

3885
03:04:51,950 --> 03:04:52,850
Wizard Monkey.

3886
03:04:55,050 --> 03:04:55,610
Yeah.

3887
03:04:58,150 --> 03:05:00,510
Five walls of fire in the first loop.

3888
03:05:01,390 --> 03:05:01,790
Guys!

3889
03:05:03,290 --> 03:05:05,710
Five Wizard Monkeys going ham.

3890
03:05:08,010 --> 03:05:09,330
This is a Wizard Monkey.

3891
03:05:09,430 --> 03:05:09,590
Yeah.

3892
03:05:09,610 --> 03:05:10,370
Wizard Monkey.

3893
03:05:10,590 --> 03:05:11,530
Wizard Monkey.

3894
03:05:11,830 --> 03:05:12,550
One.

3895
03:05:12,890 --> 03:05:13,510
Two.

3896
03:05:14,410 --> 03:05:15,130
Three.

3897
03:05:15,410 --> 03:05:16,190
Let's go.

3898
03:05:17,090 --> 03:05:17,810
Four.

3899
03:05:20,010 --> 03:05:20,730
Five.

3900
03:05:23,870 --> 03:05:24,590
Yeah!

3901
03:05:29,170 --> 03:05:30,230
Look at them.

3902
03:05:30,450 --> 03:05:30,990
Oh no!

3903
03:05:31,150 --> 03:05:32,250
I can't afford it!

3904
03:05:32,250 --> 03:05:33,290
Uh oh.

3905
03:05:33,470 --> 03:05:33,950
Incoming!

3906
03:05:36,230 --> 03:05:37,670
Well, I think we'll make it.

3907
03:05:39,690 --> 03:05:40,910
I think we'll be fine.

3908
03:05:42,110 --> 03:05:42,590
Ooh!

3909
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:55,760
They're getting faster.

3910
03:06:01,140 --> 03:06:01,620
Headshot!

3911
03:06:01,860 --> 03:06:02,420
More fire!

3912
03:06:07,550 --> 03:06:09,590
Nothing is even making it over there.

3913
03:06:11,670 --> 03:06:13,410
Nothing's even making it over there.

3914
03:06:15,750 --> 03:06:16,310
Ugh.

3915
03:06:16,630 --> 03:06:17,630
That was fun.

3916
03:06:23,470 --> 03:06:24,550
I'll do the bureau.

3917
03:06:24,790 --> 03:06:26,050
I'll do the MIB.

3918
03:06:27,270 --> 03:06:28,350
Monkeys in black.

3919
03:06:29,990 --> 03:06:31,630
Monkey Intelligence Bureau.

3920
03:06:42,820 --> 03:06:43,380
Headshot!

3921
03:06:43,720 --> 03:06:45,780
They don't do it at the same time though.

3922
03:06:45,840 --> 03:06:47,720
This guy is out of sync.

3923
03:06:49,060 --> 03:06:49,920
Oh my gosh!

3924
03:06:49,920 --> 03:06:50,620
Engineer Monkey!

3925
03:06:50,980 --> 03:06:51,220
Aww.

3926
03:06:54,260 --> 03:06:59,580
Have you seen the latest Anikura meta from Meatfest or NikuFest in Odaiba last weekend?

3927
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:02,320
Gundam Epion is out.

3928
03:07:02,440 --> 03:07:04,660
Mr. Mime Bariado is in.

3929
03:07:05,440 --> 03:07:06,000
What?

3930
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:07,500
No, I haven't.

3931
03:07:07,500 --> 03:07:08,280
Can you link me?

3932
03:07:09,320 --> 03:07:12,760
Can you like, put it in my live tag or my general tag?

3933
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:15,880
Lemmo Lemmo!

3934
03:07:16,040 --> 03:07:17,280
Thanks for the 20 gift!

3935
03:07:18,520 --> 03:07:19,080
Qmelia!

3936
03:07:19,140 --> 03:07:19,900
Welcome to Membo!

3937
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:21,960
Is that a Tenshi profile picture?

3938
03:07:23,280 --> 03:07:24,800
I love Tenshi!

3939
03:07:24,800 --> 03:07:25,580
Is that all you got?

3940
03:07:26,680 --> 03:07:27,880
I love Tenshi!

3941
03:07:34,480 --> 03:07:34,920
Nice!

3942
03:07:35,100 --> 03:07:35,540
Nice!

3943
03:07:36,720 --> 03:07:37,160
Ouch!

3944
03:07:40,720 --> 03:07:42,080
I'm just gonna keep going you guys.

3945
03:07:42,800 --> 03:07:43,240
Incoming!

3946
03:07:43,740 --> 03:07:44,800
I'm just gonna keep going.

3947
03:07:47,480 --> 03:07:49,060
What else can we do with these guys?

3948
03:07:49,200 --> 03:07:50,120
Maybe we shouldn't do anything.

3949
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:51,140
Hahaha!

3950
03:07:52,820 --> 03:07:55,180
Maybe they should just be Wall of Fire and that's it.

3951
03:07:55,260 --> 03:07:56,600
I kinda like the guided manner.

3952
03:08:04,500 --> 03:08:06,980
Spews endless flames and nearby bloons and enhance...

3953
03:08:09,020 --> 03:08:10,860
Enhanced Wall of Fire!

3954
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:14,460
Enhanced Wall of Fire!

3955
03:08:15,140 --> 03:08:16,420
Save for Necromancer...

3956
03:08:16,420 --> 03:08:19,180
I got

3957
03:08:30,620 --> 03:08:31,820
really excited about that one.

3958
03:08:36,050 --> 03:08:37,130
I got really excited about that one.

3959
03:08:37,130 --> 03:08:37,550
You know what?

3960
03:08:37,550 --> 03:08:39,110
Don't even tell me how much I spent on that.

3961
03:08:40,550 --> 03:08:44,370
Don't even tell me how much I spent on that.

3962
03:08:45,310 --> 03:08:45,990
Badabra!

3963
03:08:46,110 --> 03:08:49,230
Dada down, dada do Badabo!

3964
03:08:50,970 --> 03:08:51,650
Badaba!

3965
03:08:54,470 --> 03:08:55,510
Very good.

3966
03:08:55,790 --> 03:08:56,030
Very good.

3967
03:08:57,210 --> 03:08:58,570
How are you doing?

3968
03:08:59,190 --> 03:09:01,610
We can upgrade Sentry Gun!

3969
03:09:02,050 --> 03:09:03,670
We can upgrade Sentry Gun!

3970
03:09:03,670 --> 03:09:05,390
One singular upgrade, please.

3971
03:09:06,490 --> 03:09:07,890
One singular upgrade, please.

3972
03:09:07,890 --> 03:09:08,750
Dragons!

3973
03:09:08,750 --> 03:09:10,350
Holy cow!

3974
03:09:11,010 --> 03:09:12,630
Oh my gosh!

3975
03:09:14,010 --> 03:09:15,690
Oh, look how cute it is!

3976
03:09:16,510 --> 03:09:18,050
It's a little guy.

3977
03:09:18,550 --> 03:09:21,810
You can sell it for zero dollars.

3978
03:09:22,230 --> 03:09:24,010
This sentry is getting out of my way.

3979
03:09:26,090 --> 03:09:27,830
This is not going to hit anything.

3980
03:09:30,170 --> 03:09:30,570
Okay!

3981
03:09:31,010 --> 03:09:32,530
Oh, he's popped 14!

3982
03:09:34,450 --> 03:09:35,390
Let's go!

3983
03:09:35,930 --> 03:09:37,570
Brandon, welcome to membership!

3984
03:09:37,870 --> 03:09:38,710
Thank you so much!

3985
03:09:48,310 --> 03:09:48,750
Sweet!

3986
03:09:50,150 --> 03:09:54,450
Oh my gosh!

3987
03:09:55,730 --> 03:09:56,510
Incoming shot!

3988
03:09:58,030 --> 03:09:58,690
Come on!

3989
03:09:58,750 --> 03:10:00,670
Make it to the wall of fire!

3990
03:10:00,830 --> 03:10:01,410
I dare you!

3991
03:10:01,510 --> 03:10:01,950
I dare you!

3992
03:10:01,990 --> 03:10:02,490
I dare you!

3993
03:10:02,930 --> 03:10:04,210
Thank you for playing this game!

3994
03:10:04,250 --> 03:10:04,770
It is awesome!

3995
03:10:04,910 --> 03:10:05,730
I love it!

3996
03:10:06,390 --> 03:10:07,870
Happy Mexican Mother's Day!

3997
03:10:08,930 --> 03:10:09,470
Thank you!

3998
03:10:12,870 --> 03:10:13,850
Am I your mom?

3999
03:10:18,560 --> 03:10:20,460
What are you doing over there?

4000
03:10:20,800 --> 03:10:21,280
Oh my god!

4001
03:10:21,320 --> 03:10:21,920
He's looking!

4002
03:10:22,680 --> 03:10:23,480
You guys!

4003
03:10:23,560 --> 03:10:24,720
I think it's an inside job!

4004
03:10:25,060 --> 03:10:27,160
I think he's trying to take Ice Monkey out!

4005
03:10:28,700 --> 03:10:30,860
I think he was trying to take Ice Monkey out.

4006
03:10:31,400 --> 03:10:32,300
Oh my god!

4007
03:10:34,140 --> 03:10:35,180
This sucks!

4008
03:10:35,500 --> 03:10:36,780
It sucks so bad!

4009
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:44,940
Sounds so nice!

4010
03:10:48,460 --> 03:10:49,440
What's the next one?

4011
03:10:49,480 --> 03:10:50,180
The Phoenix, right?

4012
03:10:51,040 --> 03:10:53,680
Powerful Phoenix wreaks bloon havoc for 20 seconds.

4013
03:10:57,180 --> 03:10:58,100
Do-do-do!

4014
03:10:58,400 --> 03:10:59,160
Ba-da-boom!

4015
03:10:59,540 --> 03:11:00,740
Ba-da-boom!

4016
03:11:00,740 --> 03:11:01,340
Ba-da-boom!

4017
03:11:01,640 --> 03:11:02,840
Da-da-da-dum!

4018
03:11:02,940 --> 03:11:03,880
Da-da-da-dum!

4019
03:11:03,980 --> 03:11:05,080
Ba-da-da-dum!

4020
03:11:06,140 --> 03:11:07,020
Ba-da-da-dum!

4021
03:11:07,400 --> 03:11:09,020
Let's get the 14,000!

4022
03:11:10,160 --> 03:11:10,600
Yes!

4023
03:11:10,600 --> 03:11:11,220
We have...

4024
03:11:15,970 --> 03:11:17,270
Is that all you got?

4025
03:11:17,350 --> 03:11:19,510
I want to see... I want to see some get to the wall of fire.

4026
03:11:19,510 --> 03:11:20,710
BFB incoming!

4027
03:11:21,310 --> 03:11:21,910
BFB!

4028
03:11:21,970 --> 03:11:22,550
BFB!

4029
03:11:22,550 --> 03:11:23,150
BFB!

4030
03:11:23,190 --> 03:11:23,790
BFB!

4031
03:11:23,790 --> 03:11:24,390
BFB!

4032
03:11:24,410 --> 03:11:25,010
BFB!

4033
03:11:25,050 --> 03:11:25,630
BFB!

4034
03:11:25,650 --> 03:11:26,170
BFB!

4035
03:11:26,350 --> 03:11:26,470
BFB!

4036
03:11:27,490 --> 03:11:28,090
BFB!

4037
03:11:28,710 --> 03:11:31,350
Okay, next time we'll get enough money.

4038
03:11:32,050 --> 03:11:33,230
Just keep going!

4039
03:11:34,270 --> 03:11:34,910
Oh yeah!

4040
03:11:35,170 --> 03:11:35,730
Oh yeah!

4041
03:11:37,050 --> 03:11:38,790
Okay, next time we'll get enough money.

4042
03:11:40,710 --> 03:11:41,790
More banks?

4043
03:11:42,250 --> 03:11:42,850
Maybe.

4044
03:11:48,930 --> 03:11:49,530
Incoming!

4045
03:11:50,730 --> 03:11:51,350
So close.

4046
03:11:51,350 --> 03:11:52,110
BFB incoming!

4047
03:11:52,650 --> 03:11:53,170
BFB incoming!

4048
03:11:53,170 --> 03:11:53,430
Headshot!

4049
03:12:00,420 --> 03:12:00,940
Nice!

4050
03:12:01,800 --> 03:12:03,580
We're on round 77 already!

4051
03:12:05,880 --> 03:12:08,860
Your druid is stopping them from reaching the fire zone.

4052
03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:10,880
Stop being so good, druid!

4053
03:12:11,980 --> 03:12:14,100
I really want jungle's bounty though.

4054
03:12:14,360 --> 03:12:15,520
Oh, we're at 9,000.

4055
03:12:15,560 --> 03:12:15,960
That's not bad.

4056
03:12:18,660 --> 03:12:19,700
Druid is the GOAT.

4057
03:12:19,720 --> 03:12:21,040
I'm almost like doing it a second...

4058
03:12:21,040 --> 03:12:21,340
You know what?

4059
03:12:21,960 --> 03:12:23,480
Hell yeah, we'll get a second one.

4060
03:12:23,980 --> 03:12:24,960
Hell yeah, we'll get a second one.

4061
03:12:28,470 --> 03:12:29,950
I will get a second one.

4062
03:12:31,350 --> 03:12:32,750
Oh, they made it!

4063
03:12:32,790 --> 03:12:33,410
They made it though.

4064
03:12:38,780 --> 03:12:40,300
How Engineer Monkey doing?

4065
03:12:40,420 --> 03:12:40,920
He's good!

4066
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:43,780
He's killed a thousand bloons.

4067
03:12:44,980 --> 03:12:46,960
Look at this guy producing everything.

4068
03:12:53,360 --> 03:12:53,960
Oh!

4069
03:12:54,880 --> 03:12:55,480
Oh!

4070
03:12:56,520 --> 03:12:58,460
They were... they were camels.

4071
03:12:58,500 --> 03:12:59,460
They didn't die in here.

4072
03:13:00,500 --> 03:13:01,100
Hmm...

4073
03:13:01,100 --> 03:13:03,860
If I put a village here...

4074
03:13:04,760 --> 03:13:05,240
Here...

4075
03:13:09,370 --> 03:13:11,370
If I extend the range...

4076
03:13:11,370 --> 03:13:12,970
How far is the range on this one?

4077
03:13:13,270 --> 03:13:14,430
I don't think it'll reach.

4078
03:13:17,510 --> 03:13:19,530
But it might be good just for everybody here.

4079
03:13:27,800 --> 03:13:29,580
Give the ice monkeys a village.

4080
03:13:36,320 --> 03:13:37,040
Above them.

4081
03:13:37,100 --> 03:13:37,660
Do it above them.

4082
03:13:38,060 --> 03:13:38,880
Oh, maybe here!

4083
03:13:39,200 --> 03:13:39,580
Oh!

4084
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:44,160
This is actually...

4085
03:13:44,660 --> 03:13:45,400
But then...

4086
03:13:50,240 --> 03:13:52,040
I wish I could do it down here.

4087
03:13:52,260 --> 03:13:54,860
So I could reach like a little bit of these guys too.

4088
03:13:54,920 --> 03:13:55,720
Because this one...

4089
03:13:55,720 --> 03:13:56,640
They'll overlap.

4090
03:13:57,380 --> 03:13:58,120
You know?

4091
03:13:58,640 --> 03:14:00,380
They'll overlap in range.

4092
03:14:00,740 --> 03:14:01,260
But...

4093
03:14:04,850 --> 03:14:06,850
A village can increase other radius?

4094
03:14:12,720 --> 03:14:13,240
Nah...

4095
03:14:14,060 --> 03:14:14,820
It's worth?

4096
03:14:15,140 --> 03:14:15,440
Okay.

4097
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:17,820
So right here, are we in consensus?

4098
03:14:19,100 --> 03:14:22,080
If you are in consensus of this spot, say...

4099
03:14:24,060 --> 03:14:24,580
Say...

4100
03:14:24,580 --> 03:14:24,820
Say...

4101
03:14:25,920 --> 03:14:26,440
Yee.

4102
03:14:30,140 --> 03:14:31,000
Hear yee!

4103
03:14:31,060 --> 03:14:31,800
Hear yee!

4104
03:14:32,020 --> 03:14:32,980
Oh, say aye!

4105
03:14:42,110 --> 03:14:43,710
I can't tell if it reaches them.

4106
03:14:45,530 --> 03:14:46,050
Okay.

4107
03:14:46,130 --> 03:14:46,970
We need more money.

4108
03:14:47,790 --> 03:14:48,670
Come on, bank.

4109
03:14:48,910 --> 03:14:49,610
Thank you.

4110
03:14:56,710 --> 03:14:57,370
Handle it!

4111
03:14:58,890 --> 03:14:59,410
Yee!

4112
03:15:00,090 --> 03:15:00,610
Headshot!

4113
03:15:00,950 --> 03:15:01,470
Headshot!

4114
03:15:08,950 --> 03:15:11,830
I just realized I've been playing Bloons for three hours.

4115
03:15:12,010 --> 03:15:12,930
Oh my gosh.

4116
03:15:12,930 --> 03:15:13,990
You guys are like...

4117
03:15:13,990 --> 03:15:14,830
You don't even understand.

4118
03:15:15,170 --> 03:15:18,230
Because I think after stream, if I had done Bunny Girls...

4119
03:15:18,230 --> 03:15:19,930
I would have been like...

4120
03:15:20,450 --> 03:15:20,970
I just...

4121
03:15:20,970 --> 03:15:21,970
I'm just gonna play Bloons.

4122
03:15:22,010 --> 03:15:24,250
But now after this, I'll be all Blooned out.

4123
03:15:24,350 --> 03:15:24,810
Kind of.

4124
03:15:25,070 --> 03:15:26,270
So I can like...

4125
03:15:26,770 --> 03:15:28,050
Work on other stuff.

4126
03:15:28,150 --> 03:15:28,770
You know what I mean?

4127
03:15:28,890 --> 03:15:30,430
I can like finally be like...

4128
03:15:30,430 --> 03:15:30,630
Okay.

4129
03:15:31,410 --> 03:15:31,810
Headshot!

4130
03:15:31,890 --> 03:15:33,030
I did my Bloons.

4131
03:15:33,590 --> 03:15:34,630
I did my Bloons.

4132
03:15:34,630 --> 03:15:36,350
I can do other things that I need to finish.

4133
03:15:38,670 --> 03:15:39,990
I did my Bloons.

4134
03:15:40,010 --> 03:15:42,610
I can work on anything else that I need to work on.

4135
03:15:44,030 --> 03:15:45,090
Oh shoot.

4136
03:15:45,250 --> 03:15:45,510
Well.

4137
03:15:47,150 --> 03:15:48,430
Is that all you've got?

4138
03:15:48,690 --> 03:15:49,790
Is that all you've got?

4139
03:15:49,790 --> 03:15:50,230
Incoming!

4140
03:15:51,410 --> 03:15:52,390
BFB incoming!

4141
03:15:56,870 --> 03:15:57,430
Destroy!

4142
03:15:59,270 --> 03:15:59,770
Destroy!

4143
03:15:59,890 --> 03:16:00,330
Destroy!

4144
03:16:02,190 --> 03:16:02,750
Destroy!

4145
03:16:04,690 --> 03:16:05,250
Destroy!

4146
03:16:05,730 --> 03:16:06,710
Oh look at them!

4147
03:16:06,790 --> 03:16:07,350
They're so cute!

4148
03:16:07,790 --> 03:16:09,010
Little sentries.

4149
03:16:09,290 --> 03:16:09,910
He's trying.

4150
03:16:10,130 --> 03:16:10,630
He's trying.

4151
03:16:10,690 --> 03:16:11,070
He's helping.

4152
03:16:11,970 --> 03:16:13,610
How's my cookie clicker?

4153
03:16:13,690 --> 03:16:21,930
I haven't checked it in a bit because I like to leave it alone so it will harvest sugar lumps.

4154
03:16:29,800 --> 03:16:32,080
You guys, we're already on round 82.

4155
03:16:33,620 --> 03:16:38,740
We're already on round 82 with this setup.

4156
03:16:39,020 --> 03:16:40,380
With this setup.

4157
03:16:42,840 --> 03:16:46,020
This is kind of insane.

4158
03:16:46,020 --> 03:16:51,600
I don't know how it's happening.

4159
03:16:53,180 --> 03:16:53,620
But...

4160
03:16:59,150 --> 03:17:00,190
First strike capability.

4161
03:17:03,210 --> 03:17:05,190
Ice monkey carry, ice monkey carry.

4162
03:17:05,350 --> 03:17:09,310
Now here, do you think I should have another boat or should I get another submarine?

4163
03:17:11,650 --> 03:17:12,610
What do you think?

4164
03:17:14,090 --> 03:17:16,210
Because I think I can just fill this up.

4165
03:17:16,330 --> 03:17:18,690
I mean, there's only two water units.

4166
03:17:18,850 --> 03:17:19,290
So...

4167
03:17:20,910 --> 03:17:21,550
Siege!

4168
03:17:21,550 --> 03:17:22,410
Thanks for the...

4169
03:17:22,410 --> 03:17:24,430
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

4170
03:17:24,470 --> 03:17:25,350
Thank you so much.

4171
03:17:31,930 --> 03:17:32,670
Just upgrade?

4172
03:17:32,830 --> 03:17:33,570
I can't!

4173
03:17:34,230 --> 03:17:35,910
Just upgrade they said.

4174
03:17:36,130 --> 03:17:38,130
When I can't even upgrade.

4175
03:17:39,450 --> 03:17:40,870
Waiting for 12,000.

4176
03:17:42,090 --> 03:17:42,730
Sub?

4177
03:17:43,990 --> 03:17:44,630
Submarine?

4178
03:17:44,670 --> 03:17:45,790
Submarines are cooler.

4179
03:17:46,710 --> 03:17:47,910
Submarines are cooler.

4180
03:17:49,690 --> 03:17:51,970
A gatling straight down the path.

4181
03:17:51,970 --> 03:17:52,890
Like this.

4182
03:17:53,750 --> 03:17:55,030
Then we can get one here too.

4183
03:17:56,070 --> 03:17:57,010
That'd be so awesome.

4184
03:17:57,270 --> 03:17:57,850
You're so right.

4185
03:17:58,090 --> 03:17:59,110
Oh my gosh.

4186
03:18:01,310 --> 03:18:02,430
One here, one here too.

4187
03:18:07,110 --> 03:18:07,490
Locked.

4188
03:18:08,890 --> 03:18:09,470
Locked in.

4189
03:18:10,770 --> 03:18:12,210
You locked in.

4190
03:18:15,810 --> 03:18:16,390
Getter Emperor!

4191
03:18:16,710 --> 03:18:17,710
Thank you for the five gifted.

4192
03:18:17,890 --> 03:18:18,630
Thank you so much.

4193
03:18:18,730 --> 03:18:19,550
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4194
03:18:20,590 --> 03:18:20,970
Okay.

4195
03:18:20,970 --> 03:18:21,070
Okay.

4196
03:18:21,590 --> 03:18:22,070
Top.

4197
03:18:23,630 --> 03:18:23,970
Oh.

4198
03:18:31,320 --> 03:18:31,800
Wow!

4199
03:18:32,060 --> 03:18:33,960
Actually, that's really nice looking, isn't it?

4200
03:18:34,740 --> 03:18:38,520
It's pretty nice looking watching all like the...

4201
03:18:38,520 --> 03:18:39,120
Is that all you got?

4202
03:18:42,850 --> 03:18:43,650
Oh my gosh.

4203
03:18:43,690 --> 03:18:45,130
Aren't you scared, Gatlin Monkey?

4204
03:18:49,330 --> 03:18:50,170
Aren't you scared?

4205
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:57,100
And then they'll also get the camo.

4206
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:58,080
So it'll be good.

4207
03:18:59,200 --> 03:19:01,840
Collecting that so we can buy this for each of them.

4208
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,020
And yeah, let's go do another round.

4209
03:19:05,520 --> 03:19:06,000
Headshot.

4210
03:19:08,980 --> 03:19:11,620
After this, I'm gonna buy a helicopter.

4211
03:19:14,280 --> 03:19:14,760
Helicopter.

4212
03:19:16,480 --> 03:19:16,960
Helicopter.

4213
03:19:20,760 --> 03:19:21,240
Awesome.

4214
03:19:21,580 --> 03:19:22,040
Awesome.

4215
03:19:24,500 --> 03:19:26,160
We'll do some pushing.

4216
03:19:27,640 --> 03:19:28,900
Some more pushing.

4217
03:19:29,800 --> 03:19:31,060
Can I even fit it here?

4218
03:19:31,620 --> 03:19:32,700
I don't think so.

4219
03:19:33,200 --> 03:19:35,040
Aw, it's too far away from anything.

4220
03:19:36,300 --> 03:19:36,780
No!

4221
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:38,180
Oh.

4222
03:19:38,900 --> 03:19:39,380
No!

4223
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:40,920
Oh!

4224
03:19:41,060 --> 03:19:41,500
Oh!

4225
03:19:41,880 --> 03:19:42,240
Oh!

4226
03:19:42,240 --> 03:19:42,360
Oh!

4227
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:42,660
Oh!

4228
03:19:42,660 --> 03:19:42,780
Oh!

4229
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:43,480
Oh!

4230
03:19:43,580 --> 03:19:43,940
Oh!

4231
03:19:44,100 --> 03:19:44,340
Oh!

4232
03:19:44,920 --> 03:19:45,400
Oh!

4233
03:19:45,400 --> 03:19:45,760
Oh!

4234
03:19:45,760 --> 03:19:45,780
Oh!

4235
03:19:45,780 --> 03:19:45,840
Oh!

4236
03:19:45,840 --> 03:19:46,300
Oh!

4237
03:19:46,300 --> 03:19:46,540
Oh!

4238
03:19:46,540 --> 03:19:46,720
Oh!

4239
03:19:46,720 --> 03:19:47,080
Oh!

4240
03:19:47,080 --> 03:19:49,380
Yo, that placement is insane.

4241
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:52,440
That placement is insane!

4242
03:19:56,740 --> 03:19:57,580
Holy cow!

4243
03:19:58,580 --> 03:20:00,500
So we'll go pursuit.

4244
03:20:00,580 --> 03:20:01,680
We'll do two...

4245
03:20:01,680 --> 03:20:02,680
Okay.

4246
03:20:08,030 --> 03:20:08,790
Yo!

4247
03:20:09,430 --> 03:20:11,850
That's like pixel perfect placement, I feel.

4248
03:20:13,070 --> 03:20:13,830
Incoming!

4249
03:20:14,030 --> 03:20:14,630
Is that all you got?

4250
03:20:14,850 --> 03:20:15,470
Incoming!

4251
03:20:27,300 --> 03:20:28,060
Minty.

4252
03:20:28,080 --> 03:20:29,300
Daughter of Minty.

4253
03:20:31,300 --> 03:20:32,340
Holy woomy!

4254
03:20:33,760 --> 03:20:34,800
Not woomy.

4255
03:20:38,120 --> 03:20:39,260
Thanks for mine!

4256
03:20:39,460 --> 03:20:40,080
Is that all you got?

4257
03:20:41,260 --> 03:20:42,420
Thank you so much.

4258
03:20:44,600 --> 03:20:45,580
BFB incoming!

4259
03:20:46,700 --> 03:20:47,220
Incoming!

4260
03:20:49,920 --> 03:20:50,440
BFB.

4261
03:20:51,500 --> 03:20:53,880
I'm still scared of the DDTs though, you guys.

4262
03:20:53,920 --> 03:20:54,380
I'm scared.

4263
03:20:54,520 --> 03:20:54,920
I'm scared.

4264
03:20:55,440 --> 03:20:56,220
I'm scared.

4265
03:20:56,340 --> 03:20:56,660
I'm scared.

4266
03:20:56,820 --> 03:20:57,260
I'm scared.

4267
03:20:59,800 --> 03:21:02,460
And your return stream, you mentioned you're still figuring things out.

4268
03:21:02,560 --> 03:21:08,480
A professor I had once told me, I'm still figuring out what I want to be when I grow up.

4269
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:10,160
Sounds silly, but I hope it helps.

4270
03:21:10,440 --> 03:21:11,940
Aw, thank you.

4271
03:21:12,380 --> 03:21:19,900
I think, I mean, I think a lot of people are, you know, thinking of what they want to do.

4272
03:21:20,040 --> 03:21:20,820
ZOMG incoming!

4273
03:21:21,920 --> 03:21:24,520
And it's okay to always be thinking about stuff.

4274
03:21:25,500 --> 03:21:25,980
Headshot.

4275
03:21:26,240 --> 03:21:27,060
For sure.

4276
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:32,700
But I appreciate your, your, your, your, your wanting to help.

4277
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:36,440
Furry!

4278
03:21:36,440 --> 03:21:37,320
Welcome to membership.

4279
03:21:37,520 --> 03:21:37,960
Thank you!

4280
03:21:41,120 --> 03:21:43,560
When I upgrade this, does it add anything else or?

4281
03:21:43,700 --> 03:21:44,140
Call?

4282
03:21:44,240 --> 03:21:45,160
Oh, it just calls in the mini.

4283
03:21:45,500 --> 03:21:46,340
Command trees.

4284
03:21:49,500 --> 03:21:50,140
Oh, see!

4285
03:21:50,260 --> 03:21:50,700
Look at that!

4286
03:21:50,800 --> 03:21:52,440
We're already back at 7000!

4287
03:21:54,220 --> 03:21:54,660
Nice!

4288
03:21:54,720 --> 03:21:56,220
We can probably get the Necromancer.

4289
03:21:56,220 --> 03:21:57,140
At this rate.

4290
03:22:01,040 --> 03:22:03,560
It's always good to be open to the possibility of change, too.

4291
03:22:04,240 --> 03:22:04,680
Yeah!

4292
03:22:04,980 --> 03:22:05,500
I mean...

4293
03:22:05,500 --> 03:22:06,300
Is that all you got?

4294
03:22:08,820 --> 03:22:12,880
There's been a lot of stuff on my mind recently.

4295
03:22:14,800 --> 03:22:15,680
Um, but...

4296
03:22:16,540 --> 03:22:17,500
I think I...

4297
03:22:17,500 --> 03:22:18,400
Well, I'm not think.

4298
03:22:18,460 --> 03:22:19,860
I know I'm an over-thinker.

4299
03:22:21,780 --> 03:22:22,220
So...

4300
03:22:23,280 --> 03:22:25,940
Some decisions that come easy to some people...

4301
03:22:25,940 --> 03:22:26,200
Oh, yeah!

4302
03:22:26,200 --> 03:22:28,600
People aren't so easy for me when I'm just like...

4303
03:22:30,640 --> 03:22:31,340
Drowning pool!

4304
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:32,840
Welcome to membership.

4305
03:22:33,100 --> 03:22:33,600
Thank you!

4306
03:22:34,820 --> 03:22:35,820
Thank you so much.

4307
03:22:36,480 --> 03:22:38,380
I wonder if I should put some guys right here.

4308
03:22:38,520 --> 03:22:39,580
Just because we can, right?

4309
03:22:39,780 --> 03:22:42,460
Maybe I should have like a whole team of snipers just...

4310
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:46,540
Actually, we can have another Alchemist, right?

4311
03:22:47,780 --> 03:22:48,480
Let's do it.

4312
03:22:48,480 --> 03:22:50,060
Let's throw another Alchemist on these guys.

4313
03:22:50,800 --> 03:22:51,460
Right here.

4314
03:22:56,630 --> 03:22:58,230
And then he can buff...

4315
03:22:58,230 --> 03:22:59,090
Let's do it.

4316
03:22:59,090 --> 03:23:00,270
Buff, buff, buff, buff.

4317
03:23:02,990 --> 03:23:04,290
Buff, buff, buff, buff.

4318
03:23:10,410 --> 03:23:11,790
Round 89, baby!

4319
03:23:24,540 --> 03:23:26,000
Wall of Fire!

4320
03:23:26,300 --> 03:23:27,420
Wall of Fire!

4321
03:23:27,600 --> 03:23:28,700
Ring of Fire!

4322
03:23:30,140 --> 03:23:30,600
Louie!

4323
03:23:30,600 --> 03:23:31,380
Welcome to membership.

4324
03:23:31,400 --> 03:23:32,440
Thank you so much!

4325
03:23:33,220 --> 03:23:33,940
Glue boy?

4326
03:23:34,080 --> 03:23:35,600
It might be time for some glue, right?

4327
03:23:35,600 --> 03:23:38,300
Well, I don't know if time is the right...

4328
03:23:38,300 --> 03:23:41,580
Do glues... do glue guys work?

4329
03:23:41,680 --> 03:23:43,860
Do they work on DDTs?

4330
03:23:46,640 --> 03:23:48,580
Do the glues work on the DDT?

4331
03:23:51,420 --> 03:23:52,380
I question.

4332
03:23:55,440 --> 03:23:55,960
Yes?

4333
03:23:56,500 --> 03:23:58,300
Okay, we'll put a guy in here.

4334
03:23:59,100 --> 03:24:00,220
We'll put him right here.

4335
03:24:02,540 --> 03:24:04,420
So, Red Lentil is a glue.

4336
03:24:04,420 --> 03:24:05,280
Glue, glue.

4337
03:24:05,660 --> 03:24:07,080
Oh, I need more money.

4338
03:24:07,440 --> 03:24:08,240
Thank you.

4339
03:24:09,440 --> 03:24:09,960
Glue!

4340
03:24:12,880 --> 03:24:14,660
Okay, DDT, do your worst.

4341
03:24:15,600 --> 03:24:16,560
DDT incoming!

4342
03:24:20,520 --> 03:24:22,560
Only if they can spot Camo.

4343
03:24:23,080 --> 03:24:23,860
What do you mean?

4344
03:24:26,600 --> 03:24:27,120
Oh!

4345
03:24:28,080 --> 03:24:29,960
Okay, okay.

4346
03:24:30,080 --> 03:24:32,820
So we need them to be able to see Camo then.

4347
03:24:33,680 --> 03:24:35,240
DDTs count as Camo?

4348
03:24:35,380 --> 03:24:35,940
Yeah.

4349
03:24:36,260 --> 03:24:37,560
Shut up, Quincy!

4350
03:24:39,880 --> 03:24:40,740
Shut up!

4351
03:24:47,640 --> 03:24:50,480
I need an actual answer to that.

4352
03:24:50,720 --> 03:24:52,100
DDTs are Camo and Lead.

4353
03:24:52,340 --> 03:24:52,520
Oh!

4354
03:24:59,660 --> 03:25:00,580
Said it's strongest.

4355
03:25:00,700 --> 03:25:01,740
Thank you for the reminder.

4356
03:25:02,660 --> 03:25:03,800
Thank you for the reminder.

4357
03:25:04,340 --> 03:25:07,400
Maybe then we put a little village here.

4358
03:25:19,400 --> 03:25:22,820
It's not much, but it could help in a pinch.

4359
03:25:32,360 --> 03:25:32,820
Headshot!

4360
03:25:33,160 --> 03:25:34,460
Thank you for this every time.

4361
03:25:34,460 --> 03:25:35,240
I'll read it in just a second.

4362
03:25:35,420 --> 03:25:35,880
Sorry.

4363
03:25:36,080 --> 03:25:36,640
Hold on.

4364
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:37,720
I'm bloosin'.

4365
03:25:39,140 --> 03:25:40,060
I'm bloosin'!

4366
03:25:43,380 --> 03:25:44,760
The one last pop.

4367
03:25:48,600 --> 03:25:49,200
Where'd it go?

4368
03:25:50,200 --> 03:25:52,280
My chat's all wonky.

4369
03:25:52,900 --> 03:25:54,800
There's so many carriers you can do.

4370
03:25:55,360 --> 03:26:00,200
And you know that you can always switch to something else in the future, but that doesn't help decide what to do first.

4371
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:02,340
I don't know...

4372
03:26:03,580 --> 03:26:04,560
I don't know.

4373
03:26:06,600 --> 03:26:07,040
It's...

4374
03:26:09,080 --> 03:26:11,000
It's a little complicated, but you know.

4375
03:26:14,120 --> 03:26:14,760
It's fine.

4376
03:26:16,360 --> 03:26:17,140
It's all good.

4377
03:26:18,720 --> 03:26:22,300
I just take it one afterlife day at a time.

4378
03:26:24,800 --> 03:26:26,160
I'll play with you guys later.

4379
03:26:26,160 --> 03:26:26,560
Thank you!

4380
03:26:26,900 --> 03:26:27,480
Thank you!

4381
03:26:27,660 --> 03:26:27,720
Thank you!

4382
03:26:27,720 --> 03:26:27,960
Thank you!

4383
03:26:34,850 --> 03:26:36,310
Quincy's got your back apparently.

4384
03:26:37,230 --> 03:26:37,710
Yes?

4385
03:26:37,910 --> 03:26:39,170
Yes, you do.

4386
03:26:39,670 --> 03:26:40,870
You on my back?

4387
03:26:44,590 --> 03:26:45,550
I think...

4388
03:26:46,610 --> 03:26:47,470
We'll soak.

4389
03:26:52,150 --> 03:26:52,630
Yeah.

4390
03:26:52,790 --> 03:26:53,550
We'll soak.

4391
03:26:53,630 --> 03:26:54,010
We'll soak.

4392
03:26:54,170 --> 03:26:55,210
We'll be a little more offensive.

4393
03:26:55,210 --> 03:26:55,670
Battle you got?

4394
03:26:56,470 --> 03:26:57,990
Be a little bit more offensive.

4395
03:27:00,850 --> 03:27:02,010
Come on!

4396
03:27:04,370 --> 03:27:06,590
Oh my god, you sound so like...

4397
03:27:06,590 --> 03:27:07,890
COMG incoming!

4398
03:27:09,050 --> 03:27:10,530
You sound so like...

4399
03:27:10,530 --> 03:27:14,850
92 baby.

4400
03:27:25,640 --> 03:27:27,040
Colin, welcome to membership.

4401
03:27:27,880 --> 03:27:29,040
More choppers?

4402
03:27:29,160 --> 03:27:30,280
I agree.

4403
03:27:30,280 --> 03:27:30,440
Gray.

4404
03:27:32,660 --> 03:27:35,180
I agree, more choppers, more choppers.

4405
03:27:35,280 --> 03:27:36,600
And we can put them right here too.

4406
03:27:44,020 --> 03:27:45,080
Is it enough?

4407
03:27:45,560 --> 03:27:47,280
It's enough baby, it's enough.

4408
03:27:49,360 --> 03:27:51,240
It's enough for now, it's enough for now.

4409
03:27:51,640 --> 03:27:52,380
PSP incoming!

4410
03:27:57,200 --> 03:27:58,080
Come on!

4411
03:27:59,020 --> 03:27:59,740
You can...

4412
03:28:00,280 --> 03:28:00,760
have some.

4413
03:28:04,220 --> 03:28:04,980
Let's go!

4414
03:28:05,300 --> 03:28:06,160
I usually...

4415
03:28:06,160 --> 03:28:07,980
I do usually die at that one.

4416
03:28:08,780 --> 03:28:09,380
Incoming!

4417
03:28:09,800 --> 03:28:10,400
Headshot!

4418
03:28:10,680 --> 03:28:11,180
Headshot!

4419
03:28:12,680 --> 03:28:13,620
COMG incoming!

4420
03:28:16,040 --> 03:28:16,640
I

4421
03:28:23,680 --> 03:28:25,600
think I'll be able to get...

4422
03:28:28,120 --> 03:28:29,300
enough from this round.

4423
03:28:33,670 --> 03:28:36,430
Look, they don't even make it past the wall of fire!

4424
03:28:37,710 --> 03:28:38,010
Yo!

4425
03:28:39,650 --> 03:28:41,790
Silver guy, welcome to membership!

4426
03:28:41,790 --> 03:28:43,730
The wild spire...

4427
03:28:43,730 --> 03:28:46,070
Whoever's idea was the fire circle...

4428
03:28:46,910 --> 03:28:47,510
You...

4429
03:28:48,250 --> 03:28:49,210
You are...

4430
03:28:49,210 --> 03:28:49,610
You...

4431
03:28:49,610 --> 03:28:50,270
You...

4432
03:28:50,270 --> 03:28:51,470
You've cooked with that.

4433
03:28:52,450 --> 03:28:53,990
And they're not even like...

4434
03:28:53,990 --> 03:28:54,470
They're just...

4435
03:28:54,470 --> 03:28:56,090
They're 3-0-0...

4436
03:28:56,090 --> 03:28:56,950
Like 0-3-0.

4437
03:28:57,030 --> 03:28:57,830
It's nothing else.

4438
03:28:57,950 --> 03:28:58,990
I'm wondering...

4439
03:28:58,990 --> 03:29:01,570
Would it be worth, like, unlocking something else?

4440
03:29:01,590 --> 03:29:02,230
Like the...

4441
03:29:04,330 --> 03:29:08,070
Like, will they do other stuff as well as the wall of fire?

4442
03:29:08,230 --> 03:29:08,770
So...

4443
03:29:15,410 --> 03:29:17,090
How close are we to Necromancer?

4444
03:29:17,230 --> 03:29:18,830
Actually, really not that far away.

4445
03:29:19,930 --> 03:29:21,230
Really not that far away.

4446
03:29:26,150 --> 03:29:27,150
0-0-0.

4447
03:29:27,210 --> 03:29:28,810
Ice Monkey giving so much luck.

4448
03:29:30,850 --> 03:29:34,780
I mean, like...

4449
03:29:34,780 --> 03:29:35,600
Buying...

4450
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:37,600
Oh, I only have intense magic, actually.

4451
03:29:38,840 --> 03:29:39,580
Should I...

4452
03:29:39,580 --> 03:29:41,040
Should I upgrade the intense magic?

4453
03:29:41,180 --> 03:29:41,860
Do you think it will...

4454
03:29:41,860 --> 03:29:42,580
What's the...

4455
03:29:42,580 --> 03:29:43,380
What's the one after that?

4456
03:29:44,000 --> 03:29:45,120
Oh, the Camel Bloons.

4457
03:29:46,800 --> 03:29:49,260
Which I don't entirely need, but...

4458
03:29:51,960 --> 03:29:54,280
No, I am still aiming for the Necro.

4459
03:29:54,360 --> 03:29:56,120
That's why I'm not gonna buy any other upgrades.

4460
03:29:56,180 --> 03:29:57,220
But, I mean, like, buying...

4461
03:29:57,220 --> 03:29:59,320
Buying the intense magic, would it be worth it?

4462
03:30:00,300 --> 03:30:01,020
Or does...

4463
03:30:01,020 --> 03:30:02,680
Is it not gonna change anything, I wonder?

4464
03:30:03,980 --> 03:30:04,660
Save the money?

4465
03:30:05,160 --> 03:30:05,700
Oh, okay.

4466
03:30:05,840 --> 03:30:06,180
That's...

4467
03:30:06,180 --> 03:30:06,460
You know what?

4468
03:30:06,460 --> 03:30:06,940
That's fair, too.

4469
03:30:09,340 --> 03:30:09,700
Because...

4470
03:30:10,760 --> 03:30:11,760
How much is it?

4471
03:30:11,820 --> 03:30:11,840
I don't know.

4472
03:30:13,260 --> 03:30:14,600
Oh, it's so cheap!

4473
03:30:15,180 --> 03:30:16,600
It's so cheap, actually.

4474
03:30:18,360 --> 03:30:18,760
Wait.

4475
03:30:18,940 --> 03:30:20,080
Is it actually that...

4476
03:30:21,040 --> 03:30:22,240
Why is it so cheap?

4477
03:30:26,840 --> 03:30:27,240
I...

4478
03:30:27,240 --> 03:30:27,940
Oh, a water base.

4479
03:30:28,040 --> 03:30:28,320
That's right.

4480
03:30:28,380 --> 03:30:29,100
I was gonna get the sub.

4481
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:32,440
Can I get a sub end bolt?

4482
03:30:33,140 --> 03:30:34,100
I don't think so.

4483
03:30:34,440 --> 03:30:35,860
I think it's one or the other, man.

4484
03:30:37,340 --> 03:30:37,740
Yeah.

4485
03:30:38,420 --> 03:30:40,460
Only three guys can fit here.

4486
03:30:41,040 --> 03:30:41,680
That's okay.

4487
03:30:42,300 --> 03:30:42,700
What...

4488
03:30:42,700 --> 03:30:43,400
What'd I give you?

4489
03:30:43,500 --> 03:30:43,860
I don't know.

4490
03:30:49,590 --> 03:30:51,690
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

4491
03:30:56,490 --> 03:30:56,970
Oopsie.

4492
03:30:57,750 --> 03:30:59,410
I didn't mean to do that.

4493
03:31:17,760 --> 03:31:19,640
Since I can't add another guy, anyway.

4494
03:31:21,420 --> 03:31:21,900
Okay.

4495
03:31:22,040 --> 03:31:22,360
Whew.

4496
03:31:22,520 --> 03:31:22,980
There we go.

4497
03:31:34,460 --> 03:31:35,980
Is that all you got?

4498
03:31:36,260 --> 03:31:36,740
Oh...

4499
03:31:36,740 --> 03:31:37,520
Aaaaah!!

4500
03:31:37,520 --> 03:31:38,660
You can all have.

4501
03:31:38,740 --> 03:31:39,440
Come on.

4502
03:31:44,880 --> 03:31:45,840
Holy cow!

4503
03:31:45,860 --> 03:31:46,120
Oh, I'm gonna die.

4504
03:31:46,120 --> 03:31:46,300
Wow!

4505
03:31:51,620 --> 03:31:52,160
Awesome!

4506
03:31:52,580 --> 03:31:54,280
I'm a knowledgeable monkey.

4507
03:31:58,340 --> 03:31:58,880
Sheesh!

4508
03:31:59,540 --> 03:32:02,280
The wall of fire is so OP!

4509
03:32:04,080 --> 03:32:04,900
Holy cow!

4510
03:32:05,080 --> 03:32:06,400
And also the druid!

4511
03:32:06,400 --> 03:32:07,860
I'm like, should I upgrade him too?

4512
03:32:08,340 --> 03:32:09,400
How close are you?

4513
03:32:14,720 --> 03:32:17,420
Maybe I should also do like the hard thorns?

4514
03:32:19,500 --> 03:32:19,840
Hmm...

4515
03:32:21,360 --> 03:32:22,840
What's the one after that?

4516
03:32:23,020 --> 03:32:23,520
Oh, the thunder!

4517
03:32:28,380 --> 03:32:28,900
Yeah...

4518
03:32:30,920 --> 03:32:32,900
Doesn't hurt to buy it, right?

4519
03:32:37,520 --> 03:32:38,040
Headshot!

4520
03:32:38,300 --> 03:32:38,560
COMG incoming!

4521
03:32:49,980 --> 03:32:51,020
Holy cow!

4522
03:32:51,620 --> 03:32:53,140
You know what you need more of?

4523
03:32:53,740 --> 03:32:55,180
What is it, Josh?

4524
03:32:55,540 --> 03:32:56,580
What could it be?

4525
03:32:57,900 --> 03:32:58,000
Hahaha!

4526
03:33:02,810 --> 03:33:05,030
Absolutely cooked, man!

4527
03:33:06,690 --> 03:33:07,810
Absolutely cooked!

4528
03:33:08,390 --> 03:33:08,910
Hahaha!

4529
03:33:11,150 --> 03:33:12,530
Absolutely cooked!

4530
03:33:13,970 --> 03:33:15,030
This is crazy.

4531
03:33:15,270 --> 03:33:18,330
We're gonna be able to get the necromancer so soon.

4532
03:33:18,810 --> 03:33:19,750
Hopefully, hopefully.

4533
03:33:21,090 --> 03:33:21,650
Oh!

4534
03:33:22,810 --> 03:33:23,690
Oh my gosh!

4535
03:33:25,370 --> 03:33:25,930
Whoopsie!

4536
03:33:26,430 --> 03:33:27,370
What about you?

4537
03:33:28,150 --> 03:33:28,710
Oh!

4538
03:33:28,990 --> 03:33:31,050
And maybe the plasma generator too!

4539
03:33:32,390 --> 03:33:33,630
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.

4540
03:33:34,310 --> 03:33:36,570
How much is that one if I end up getting it?

4541
03:33:36,590 --> 03:33:37,170
11,000.

4542
03:33:37,950 --> 03:33:38,990
That's okay, we can afford it.

4543
03:33:40,390 --> 03:33:40,770
Okay.

4544
03:33:42,390 --> 03:33:44,350
I might even get another necromancer.

4545
03:33:44,370 --> 03:33:44,650
You know what?

4546
03:33:44,730 --> 03:33:48,870
Since we're about to get the necromancer, I will get another magic monkey.

4547
03:33:49,090 --> 03:33:49,870
I'll put him down here.

4548
03:33:52,010 --> 03:33:52,390
Perfect.

4549
03:33:53,650 --> 03:33:54,030
And...

4550
03:33:55,650 --> 03:33:59,550
We're gonna also do that.

4551
03:34:03,280 --> 03:34:04,520
Wall of fire!

4552
03:34:04,720 --> 03:34:05,560
Wall of fire!

4553
03:34:05,820 --> 03:34:07,220
Wall of fire!

4554
03:34:07,320 --> 03:34:08,200
Wall of fire!

4555
03:34:14,400 --> 03:34:15,000
Headshot!

4556
03:34:21,360 --> 03:34:21,960
Stop!

4557
03:34:22,680 --> 03:34:23,280
Oh!

4558
03:34:23,300 --> 03:34:23,600
Wait!

4559
03:34:24,240 --> 03:34:24,840
Yippee!

4560
03:34:34,620 --> 03:34:35,560
What about you?

4561
03:34:37,440 --> 03:34:38,400
So close!

4562
03:34:38,440 --> 03:34:38,880
So close!

4563
03:34:38,880 --> 03:34:39,260
So close!

4564
03:34:42,520 --> 03:34:42,980
Let's go!

4565
03:34:43,880 --> 03:34:44,280
Alright.

4566
03:34:47,200 --> 03:34:48,580
Is that all you got?

4567
03:34:52,140 --> 03:34:52,880
Oh my god!

4568
03:34:52,920 --> 03:34:53,620
They scared me!

4569
03:34:55,200 --> 03:34:56,220
I was like, what are these?

4570
03:35:01,310 --> 03:35:03,030
You can all have some!

4571
03:35:04,910 --> 03:35:05,310
Oh!

4572
03:35:10,730 --> 03:35:11,450
Oh my god!

4573
03:35:11,510 --> 03:35:12,010
Oh my god!

4574
03:35:12,090 --> 03:35:12,570
Oh my god!

4575
03:35:12,590 --> 03:35:12,970
Oh my god!

4576
03:35:12,990 --> 03:35:13,330
Oh my god!

4577
03:35:13,890 --> 03:35:15,130
I am the best!

4578
03:35:20,660 --> 03:35:23,580
Why were all the attacking balloons going up?

4579
03:35:24,640 --> 03:35:28,580
I guess they count for like some back end support.

4580
03:35:33,040 --> 03:35:34,680
You can change where he summons.

4581
03:35:34,740 --> 03:35:34,940
Oh!

4582
03:35:35,020 --> 03:35:35,380
Awesome!

4583
03:35:35,560 --> 03:35:36,100
Okay, let's see.

4584
03:35:37,060 --> 03:35:37,500
Um...

4585
03:35:41,960 --> 03:35:43,080
Click to set targets.

4586
03:35:43,100 --> 03:35:44,080
So like that, right?

4587
03:35:45,300 --> 03:35:46,200
And like this?

4588
03:35:47,180 --> 03:35:48,080
I don't know actually.

4589
03:35:48,160 --> 03:35:48,660
What does this do?

4590
03:35:53,830 --> 03:35:54,270
Oh!

4591
03:35:54,310 --> 03:35:55,430
Is it like targets...

4592
03:35:56,570 --> 03:35:58,110
Camo and doesn't target camo?

4593
03:36:02,560 --> 03:36:05,240
But is it camo or non-camo?

4594
03:36:05,260 --> 03:36:07,020
Like you can't do both of them at the same time?

4595
03:36:09,140 --> 03:36:10,620
Quincy, son of Quincy, is now at max...

4596
03:36:10,620 --> 03:36:12,220
He's max level!

4597
03:36:14,580 --> 03:36:15,060
Let's go!

4598
03:36:17,800 --> 03:36:18,220
Mmm!

4599
03:36:19,400 --> 03:36:20,120
Just priority!

4600
03:36:20,400 --> 03:36:20,740
Just priority!

4601
03:36:21,020 --> 03:36:21,260
Mmm!

4602
03:36:21,380 --> 03:36:21,560
Mmm!

4603
03:36:21,560 --> 03:36:21,760
Mmm!

4604
03:36:21,760 --> 03:36:21,880
Mmm!

4605
03:36:26,030 --> 03:36:27,930
But it will still attack the other ones, right?

4606
03:36:28,130 --> 03:36:29,010
So it's not so bad.

4607
03:36:30,170 --> 03:36:31,190
How are you doing?

4608
03:36:32,190 --> 03:36:32,630
Ooh!

4609
03:36:32,690 --> 03:36:34,650
We're pretty far from that one, but that's okay.

4610
03:36:34,770 --> 03:36:35,070
Okay.

4611
03:36:35,150 --> 03:36:36,270
What can I get?

4612
03:36:36,390 --> 03:36:38,510
Because they got through pretty easily.

4613
03:36:40,030 --> 03:36:41,770
They got around to here.

4614
03:36:42,050 --> 03:36:42,930
So I'm nervous.

4615
03:36:43,110 --> 03:36:43,490
I'm nervous.

4616
03:36:44,290 --> 03:36:45,790
I mean, there's so much we can add.

4617
03:36:45,890 --> 03:36:47,490
We have so much space.

4618
03:36:50,110 --> 03:36:50,550
Um...

4619
03:36:57,680 --> 03:36:59,120
Bigger stacks for the... Oh!

4620
03:36:59,180 --> 03:37:00,160
For this one?

4621
03:37:01,840 --> 03:37:02,320
Ooh!

4622
03:37:02,540 --> 03:37:03,680
And hot stacks!

4623
03:37:06,580 --> 03:37:07,280
There we go.

4624
03:37:11,330 --> 03:37:12,850
Trying to decide what I want.

4625
03:37:15,030 --> 03:37:16,370
We'll take our money too.

4626
03:37:19,530 --> 03:37:21,350
Upgrade what I... Upgrade what I have now.

4627
03:37:21,490 --> 03:37:27,470
I don't have anything that can like go... See, like everything is... Everything is... I'm waiting.

4628
03:37:27,630 --> 03:37:30,030
I can't really upgrade anything that I have right now.

4629
03:37:31,330 --> 03:37:31,810
Unfortunately.

4630
03:37:36,530 --> 03:37:40,490
I'm trying to get more of the top path for that guy.

4631
03:37:41,210 --> 03:37:42,430
Another helicopter.

4632
03:37:44,980 --> 03:37:45,770
This is good.

4633
03:37:45,890 --> 03:37:46,290
This is good.

4634
03:37:47,430 --> 03:37:49,290
Maybe another ice monkey.

4635
03:37:49,970 --> 03:37:52,870
Oh, I wonder what is... Yo!

4636
03:37:53,670 --> 03:37:55,270
We're doing nothing!

4637
03:37:57,100 --> 03:37:58,870
Guy is absolutely cracked.

4638
03:37:59,910 --> 03:38:01,250
Absolutely cracked.

4639
03:38:09,660 --> 03:38:10,860
0, 0, 0.

4640
03:38:10,880 --> 03:38:12,020
There are ice monkeys in the center.

4641
03:38:12,400 --> 03:38:13,240
In the middle.

4642
03:38:16,360 --> 03:38:18,120
Glue monkey for the wall of fire.

4643
03:38:18,300 --> 03:38:20,780
Oh, so like have him like kind of stuck in here?

4644
03:38:20,960 --> 03:38:21,540
That's a good idea.

4645
03:38:21,700 --> 03:38:22,280
I like that.

4646
03:38:32,240 --> 03:38:33,400
We'll even do the same one.

4647
03:38:35,980 --> 03:38:36,360
And...

4648
03:38:41,860 --> 03:38:42,380
Oh, wait.

4649
03:38:42,460 --> 03:38:43,120
Would he fit here?

4650
03:38:44,120 --> 03:38:44,500
No.

4651
03:38:45,820 --> 03:38:47,180
Oh, but he could fit here.

4652
03:38:47,580 --> 03:38:48,240
Oh, shoot.

4653
03:38:49,820 --> 03:38:51,420
I don't think he's getting... Oh!

4654
03:38:53,060 --> 03:38:54,340
Maybe I messed up.

4655
03:39:06,550 --> 03:39:07,570
You know what?

4656
03:39:07,650 --> 03:39:08,810
I'm sticking with it.

4657
03:39:13,120 --> 03:39:14,280
Get bigger globs.

4658
03:39:16,680 --> 03:39:17,360
I did.

4659
03:39:21,060 --> 03:39:21,900
Run ruined.

4660
03:39:24,120 --> 03:39:25,440
Okay, let's get another helicopter.

4661
03:39:25,440 --> 03:39:27,520
Do I have a mid helicopter?

4662
03:39:28,180 --> 03:39:28,620
No.

4663
03:39:29,520 --> 03:39:30,360
I do not.

4664
03:39:31,260 --> 03:39:36,200
In fact, I'm gonna put this one here.

4665
03:39:37,360 --> 03:39:39,720
I think you can fit a monkey next to it.

4666
03:39:41,000 --> 03:39:42,080
What, like this one?

4667
03:39:42,180 --> 03:39:44,060
The downdraft one?

4668
03:39:45,420 --> 03:39:46,940
I guess I could unlock it.

4669
03:39:54,440 --> 03:39:56,020
Other glue needs bigger globs too.

4670
03:39:56,240 --> 03:39:58,020
No, this one... I already did this one.

4671
03:39:58,060 --> 03:39:58,880
It's corrosive though.

4672
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:03,660
The path is support, which is not bad.

4673
03:40:04,280 --> 03:40:11,560
Support is good because, you know, the more we can push back, the more time we can save to blow them up, you know?

4674
03:40:12,540 --> 03:40:14,120
So maybe 2...

4675
03:40:15,860 --> 03:40:16,380
2...

4676
03:40:16,380 --> 03:40:17,140
5-0?

4677
03:40:19,120 --> 03:40:19,640
Maybe.

4678
03:40:22,300 --> 03:40:24,240
I can't afford the apache.

4679
03:40:25,740 --> 03:40:27,660
It's great versus ceramics.

4680
03:40:27,780 --> 03:40:29,420
I think I want to try it, you know?

4681
03:40:31,020 --> 03:40:32,280
Oh, I can't afford it.

4682
03:40:34,460 --> 03:40:35,380
And then pursuit.

4683
03:40:36,840 --> 03:40:37,320
Incoming!

4684
03:40:38,900 --> 03:40:39,860
DDT incoming!

4685
03:40:45,180 --> 03:40:45,660
Yeah!

4686
03:40:47,400 --> 03:40:48,120
Am I...

4687
03:40:48,120 --> 03:40:50,400
I feel like I'm stressing for no reason.

4688
03:40:50,480 --> 03:40:53,900
Because everything is like la la la, easy peasy.

4689
03:40:54,220 --> 03:40:58,580
You have a mid blue fellow in the middle Yeah, what about him?

4690
03:40:59,600 --> 03:41:01,000
What about him, Joshua?

4691
03:41:02,820 --> 03:41:04,320
You can't bully me!

4692
03:41:04,420 --> 03:41:05,720
He's perfect the way he is!

4693
03:41:05,920 --> 03:41:07,540
I have 18 bucks left.

4694
03:41:08,060 --> 03:41:08,580
Alright.

4695
03:41:10,100 --> 03:41:14,100
Well, I can't actually do anything because I only have $18, so...

4696
03:41:15,220 --> 03:41:15,740
YOLO!

4697
03:41:16,720 --> 03:41:17,240
Oh!

4698
03:41:17,360 --> 03:41:18,960
This is the big airship of Doom!

4699
03:41:19,040 --> 03:41:21,060
It's big, slow, and incredibly hard to take down!

4700
03:41:23,060 --> 03:41:24,100
Uh, guys?

4701
03:41:25,160 --> 03:41:26,920
You can all have some.

4702
03:41:27,160 --> 03:41:28,240
Come on!

4703
03:41:28,440 --> 03:41:29,040
Um...

4704
03:41:29,040 --> 03:41:31,840
Whoa, I just noticed what these look like.

4705
03:41:32,080 --> 03:41:33,180
Um, guys?

4706
03:41:34,940 --> 03:41:35,540
Oh.

4707
03:41:40,570 --> 03:41:42,270
Is that all you got?

4708
03:41:44,550 --> 03:41:45,450
Insta monkey!

4709
03:41:47,230 --> 03:41:47,830
Yippee!

4710
03:41:50,590 --> 03:41:51,190
Yippee!

4711
03:41:51,190 --> 03:41:51,370
Yippee!

4712
03:41:52,070 --> 03:41:52,810
Let's go!

4713
03:41:55,010 --> 03:41:55,870
Let's go!

4714
03:41:57,490 --> 03:41:58,690
Let's go!

4715
03:41:58,690 --> 03:41:59,590
Oh my gosh!

4716
03:41:59,790 --> 03:42:00,790
Round 100!

4717
03:42:01,810 --> 03:42:02,170
Woohoo!

4718
03:42:02,950 --> 03:42:03,370
Yeah!

4719
03:42:05,010 --> 03:42:05,530
Yeah!

4720
03:42:05,790 --> 03:42:07,070
Oh, hi for you!

4721
03:42:12,390 --> 03:42:14,170
Oh, we're so close here!

4722
03:42:14,330 --> 03:42:14,990
What about this one?

4723
03:42:16,070 --> 03:42:16,590
Oh!

4724
03:42:18,450 --> 03:42:18,970
Close!

4725
03:42:19,570 --> 03:42:20,690
Close, close, close.

4726
03:42:21,670 --> 03:42:22,610
Alright, you know what?

4727
03:42:22,750 --> 03:42:23,610
Just go for it.

4728
03:42:25,210 --> 03:42:25,730
Headshot!

4729
03:42:26,850 --> 03:42:27,250
Headshot!

4730
03:42:27,910 --> 03:42:28,650
That was it?

4731
03:42:29,290 --> 03:42:30,010
That was it?

4732
03:42:30,710 --> 03:42:31,190
That's it?

4733
03:42:31,930 --> 03:42:33,150
I felt like that was nothing!

4734
03:42:35,910 --> 03:42:37,770
I felt like that was nothing!

4735
03:42:40,510 --> 03:42:42,030
No, I can't get my gatling.

4736
03:42:42,110 --> 03:42:43,050
I want the plasma.

4737
03:42:44,810 --> 03:42:46,010
I can't get it yet.

4738
03:42:46,270 --> 03:42:47,150
I can't get it yet.

4739
03:42:47,290 --> 03:42:47,610
You know what?

4740
03:42:47,870 --> 03:42:48,670
Just keep going.

4741
03:42:53,720 --> 03:42:54,120
Headshot!

4742
03:42:54,120 --> 03:42:54,280
I'm coming!

4743
03:42:56,200 --> 03:42:58,020
You can all have some!

4744
03:42:58,200 --> 03:43:00,000
You can all have some!

4745
03:43:00,200 --> 03:43:01,060
Come on!

4746
03:43:12,080 --> 03:43:14,260
I'm hearing someone talking on the right.

4747
03:43:14,380 --> 03:43:15,280
I don't know who...

4748
03:43:15,840 --> 03:43:17,680
Who is talking in my ear?

4749
03:43:19,960 --> 03:43:21,180
Came back from a break.

4750
03:43:21,260 --> 03:43:23,400
Glad to see our blue boy still dead center.

4751
03:43:23,540 --> 03:43:24,060
Absolutely!

4752
03:43:24,260 --> 03:43:24,880
Look at him go!

4753
03:43:25,120 --> 03:43:25,700
He's like, Yippee!

4754
03:43:25,800 --> 03:43:26,120
We won!

4755
03:43:28,080 --> 03:43:28,600
Yippee!

4756
03:43:30,260 --> 03:43:31,080
Spiked balls!

4757
03:43:32,480 --> 03:43:35,080
Do extra damage to ceramic and fortified balloons.

4758
03:43:35,880 --> 03:43:38,880
Shoot out a thick layer of spikes over the entire track!

4759
03:43:40,060 --> 03:43:41,320
I want that one.

4760
03:43:42,940 --> 03:43:44,980
I need a lot of experience though.

4761
03:43:45,720 --> 03:43:46,600
Let's just keep going.

4762
03:43:47,920 --> 03:43:49,440
Is that all you got?

4763
03:43:55,540 --> 03:43:56,240
Uh oh.

4764
03:43:59,940 --> 03:44:02,140
I said uh oh, but I didn't mean it.

4765
03:44:02,340 --> 03:44:03,760
You can all have some!

4766
03:44:13,630 --> 03:44:14,430
We'll see though.

4767
03:44:15,430 --> 03:44:16,410
Uh oh.

4768
03:44:16,490 --> 03:44:17,350
Uh oh for real.

4769
03:44:17,510 --> 03:44:18,190
Uh oh for real!

4770
03:44:19,650 --> 03:44:20,790
Uh oh for real!

4771
03:44:20,970 --> 03:44:21,470
Seriously?

4772
03:44:22,750 --> 03:44:24,210
Uh oh for real!

4773
03:44:25,270 --> 03:44:26,050
Come on!

4774
03:44:28,470 --> 03:44:28,970
Yay!

4775
03:44:32,490 --> 03:44:32,990
Oh

4776
03:44:38,680 --> 03:44:40,080
man, that was intense.

4777
03:44:40,520 --> 03:44:42,240
The fire has breached.

4778
03:44:43,680 --> 03:44:44,960
That was awfully close.

4779
03:44:45,060 --> 03:44:46,660
It actually was pretty close, wasn't it?

4780
03:44:48,200 --> 03:44:49,320
That was pretty close.

4781
03:44:49,320 --> 03:44:50,520
That was pretty close.

4782
03:44:51,740 --> 03:44:58,640
But we've reached around 103 in fact, so I am quite satisfied with that.

4783
03:44:59,140 --> 03:45:00,140
Give me one second.

4784
03:45:00,200 --> 03:45:03,800
I am going to take us over to our brand new, if you guys haven't seen it yet.

4785
03:45:04,620 --> 03:45:06,020
If you haven't seen it yet.

4786
03:45:06,780 --> 03:45:07,400
Ta-da!

4787
03:45:09,620 --> 03:45:12,780
I'm also going to turn off the music because I want to listen to my own music.

4788
03:45:17,400 --> 03:45:18,180
Um...

4789
03:45:21,180 --> 03:45:21,960
Um...

4790
03:45:21,960 --> 03:45:22,660
What do I want to listen to?

4791
03:45:24,360 --> 03:45:25,140
Um...

4792
03:45:25,140 --> 03:45:26,680
This...

4793
03:45:26,680 --> 03:45:27,280
one.

4794
03:45:45,350 --> 03:45:47,370
If you haven't seen it yet...

4795
03:45:48,470 --> 03:45:49,770
We moved!

4796
03:45:50,450 --> 03:45:51,730
New maid cafe!

4797
03:45:52,370 --> 03:45:52,850
Yeah.

4798
03:45:53,030 --> 03:45:55,390
I showed it earlier on in the stream.

4799
03:45:55,570 --> 03:46:00,690
So if you want like a detailed tour, you can check it out then.

4800
03:46:01,890 --> 03:46:04,230

03:46:07,010 --> 03:46:07,930
Thank you so much!

4804
03:46:10,010 --> 03:46:10,610
Thank you!

4805
03:46:10,830 --> 03:46:11,190
Thank you!

4806
03:46:11,190 --> 03:46:11,210
Thank you!

4807
03:46:11,230 --> 03:46:11,570
Thank you!

4808
03:46:14,350 --> 03:46:15,690
So cute, right?

4809
03:46:16,390 --> 03:46:17,530
So cute, right?

4810
03:46:19,110 --> 03:46:19,590
Yeah.

4811
03:46:20,330 --> 03:46:20,810
So...

4812
03:46:21,770 --> 03:46:22,590
It's all...

4813
03:46:22,590 --> 03:46:24,150
All revamped.

4814
03:46:25,250 --> 03:46:25,770
Fancy.

4815
03:46:26,770 --> 03:46:27,830
For main day!

4816
03:46:28,950 --> 03:46:32,190
Well, not entirely for main day, but it just happened to...

4817
03:46:33,430 --> 03:46:35,250
To kind of work out that way.

4818
03:46:40,430 --> 03:46:41,850
I forgot it's 310.

4819
03:46:41,890 --> 03:46:42,410
Happy main day!

4820
03:46:42,510 --> 03:46:43,070
Thank you!

4821
03:46:43,230 --> 03:46:44,750
Happy main day!

4822
03:46:46,930 --> 03:46:48,090
Happy main day!

4823
03:46:48,170 --> 03:46:48,830
Happy main day!

4824
03:46:52,130 --> 03:46:52,610
What?

4825
03:47:01,810 --> 03:47:04,590
If you're interested in a new theme, there's an Adventure Time Bloons.

4826
03:47:05,070 --> 03:47:05,550
Really?

4827
03:47:06,430 --> 03:47:07,670
Adventure Time themed?

4828
03:47:08,190 --> 03:47:09,610
Boy, that sounds so awesome.

4829
03:47:12,110 --> 03:47:12,590
Ah!

4830
03:47:13,530 --> 03:47:14,370
Cute Minto.

4831
03:47:15,350 --> 03:47:16,250
People, people.

4832
03:47:19,330 --> 03:47:20,930
Welcome back for one month!

4833
03:47:21,010 --> 03:47:21,670
Thank you so much!

4834
03:47:23,210 --> 03:47:23,930
Finally, what?

4835
03:47:24,090 --> 03:47:26,130
I know people have been asking When is what three?

4836
03:47:27,710 --> 03:47:28,190
Patience.

4837
03:47:29,530 --> 03:47:31,370
Whenever Wet 3 happens, it happens.

4838
03:47:32,050 --> 03:47:36,970
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, you can check out some of the videos on my channel.

4839
03:47:37,170 --> 03:47:40,630
I did Wet, and then Wet 2, and then one day will be Wet 3.

4840
03:47:42,190 --> 03:47:43,530
Thanks for the stream, IceMonkeyMade.

4841
03:47:45,330 --> 03:47:46,630
Thank you guys again.

4842
03:47:46,790 --> 03:47:48,650
I'm so sorry for the change in the schedule.

4843
03:47:49,270 --> 03:47:57,710
But thank you for letting me indulge in in my monkey shenanigans.

4844
03:47:57,910 --> 03:47:58,350
So...

4845
03:47:59,550 --> 03:48:01,330
I appreciate it very much.

4846
03:48:01,570 --> 03:48:02,530
Thank you so much.

4847
03:48:03,230 --> 03:48:04,450
It was a lot of fun too.

4848
03:48:08,480 --> 03:48:08,880
Yeah.

4849
03:48:10,980 --> 03:48:11,380
Wait.

4850
03:48:11,500 --> 03:48:12,560
Oh my gosh, my chat is frozen.

4851
03:48:12,780 --> 03:48:13,060
Hold on.

4852
03:48:13,080 --> 03:48:14,060
Was that on Akasupa again?

4853
03:48:14,900 --> 03:48:17,760
Happy May Day to our favorite ghostly maid, Valentine!

4854
03:48:18,160 --> 03:48:18,900
Thank you!

4855
03:48:20,700 --> 03:48:21,920
Happy May Day!

4856
03:48:22,580 --> 03:48:23,780
Aw, you guys are so nice.

4857
03:48:24,060 --> 03:48:25,880
Thanks for wishing me a Happy May Day.

4858
03:48:25,920 --> 03:48:26,960
And Happy May Day to you too!

4859
03:48:27,100 --> 03:48:33,360
I hope your timelines have been blessed with many wonderful maid art and fan art.

4860
03:48:33,620 --> 03:48:33,980
So...

4861
03:48:34,840 --> 03:48:37,300
Lovely maids that always blesses the timeline.

4862
03:48:40,380 --> 03:48:43,160
On days like these, Twitter feels a little less cursed.

4863
03:48:43,260 --> 03:48:43,560
Right?

4864
03:48:45,260 --> 03:48:46,260
When it's like...

4865
03:48:46,260 --> 03:48:48,160
My favorite is in

4866
03:48:51,280 --> 03:49:02,460
November because when you do 11 as the date, it kind of it looks like I-I So that would be E.

4867
03:49:02,840 --> 03:49:08,660
So like in Japan, almost every day is like E, which means like good blank day.

4868
03:49:08,840 --> 03:49:14,420
So it'll be like E E Futamomo no hi Good thigh day.

4869
03:49:14,600 --> 03:49:15,800
Or something like that.

4870
03:49:16,100 --> 03:49:19,940
So, November is super duper blessed for that.

4871
03:49:21,380 --> 03:49:23,420
For all that fun stuff.

4872
03:49:24,220 --> 03:49:25,160
Mint, I'm crying.

4873
03:49:25,300 --> 03:49:27,500
I got to see the Northern Lights here in Oklahoma!

4874
03:49:33,850 --> 03:49:35,370
How do you see them in Oklahoma?

4875
03:49:37,590 --> 03:49:39,210
So effing happy right now.

4876
03:49:39,270 --> 03:49:41,710
So I demand more balloons in the future.

4877
03:49:41,850 --> 03:49:42,650
Thanks, Nibby.

4878
03:49:43,130 --> 03:49:44,590
I hope you're having fun.

4879
03:49:45,030 --> 03:49:45,510
What?

4880
03:49:47,150 --> 03:49:48,450
That explains a lot.

4881
03:49:48,630 --> 03:49:49,850
Yeah, good tummy day?

4882
03:49:49,950 --> 03:49:50,330
Yeah, yeah.

4883
03:49:50,370 --> 03:49:51,690
Good tummy day is another one.

4884
03:49:56,890 --> 03:49:58,530
Good day thing beloved.

4885
03:50:02,570 --> 03:50:04,410
It's because of the solar storm.

4886
03:50:05,250 --> 03:50:06,910
I saw them in New York tonight.

4887
03:50:07,630 --> 03:50:08,110
What?

4888
03:50:09,190 --> 03:50:10,090
Solar storm?

4889
03:50:11,470 --> 03:50:12,590
I had no idea.

4890
03:50:12,910 --> 03:50:14,110
I don't catch up with the news.

4891
03:50:15,730 --> 03:50:19,470
I don't I don't I don't keep track of anything.

4892
03:50:19,710 --> 03:50:20,210
Oh gosh.

4893
03:50:20,470 --> 03:50:20,790
Wait.

4894
03:50:21,310 --> 03:50:23,410
Maybe I could have seen the Northern Lights.

4895
03:50:23,450 --> 03:50:23,910
I don't know.

4896
03:50:29,410 --> 03:50:30,530
It's cloudy here.

4897
03:50:30,650 --> 03:50:30,970
Oh no.

4898
03:50:34,810 --> 03:50:37,270
I'm gonna go out when the clouds clear up and check.

4899
03:50:37,450 --> 03:50:37,650
Yeah!

4900
03:50:38,390 --> 03:50:40,170
Wait, do you guys have any pictures?

4901
03:50:44,750 --> 03:50:45,770
I wanna see!

4902
03:50:46,030 --> 03:50:47,810
I wanna see the Northern Lights!

4903
03:50:49,290 --> 03:50:56,930
But honestly, I was like thinking of maybe doing a trip to see the Northern Lights.

4904
03:50:58,730 --> 03:51:04,130
Because I I'm I want to be a little bit more world travel-y.

4905
03:51:04,270 --> 03:51:05,370
I've never been to Europe.

4906
03:51:05,530 --> 03:51:07,590
So I was like, well if I go to like I don't know.

4907
03:51:09,990 --> 03:51:10,590
I don't know.

4908
03:51:15,830 --> 03:51:17,790
But like, I would wanna I don't know.

4909
03:51:18,090 --> 03:51:18,990
I have no idea.

4910
03:51:21,610 --> 03:51:27,890
I have to think of how I can incorporate it into something, you know?

4911
03:51:29,910 --> 03:51:30,470
Um...

4912
03:51:31,370 --> 03:51:32,410
Like uh...

4913
03:51:32,410 --> 03:51:38,530
Like maybe if I went and saw Kiwawa and then traveled to see the Northern Lights or something.

4914
03:51:39,170 --> 03:51:40,190
That could work.

4915
03:51:40,270 --> 03:51:41,730
Or if Kiwawa wants to come with me.

4916
03:51:43,930 --> 03:51:45,190
I don't know.

4917
03:51:48,010 --> 03:51:49,290
Can you see them in Alaska?

4918
03:51:51,010 --> 03:51:52,710
I... Maybe in parts of Alaska.

4919
03:51:53,330 --> 03:51:55,210
There was actually... I um...

4920
03:51:55,210 --> 03:51:59,750
I saw a video recently about a national park in Alaska.

4921
03:52:00,170 --> 03:52:01,350
I bookmarked it.

4922
03:52:01,470 --> 03:52:03,390
Hold on, let me see what it's called for anyone else interested.

4923
03:52:03,650 --> 03:52:06,030
Because I was like this sounds so awesome.

4924
03:52:08,010 --> 03:52:08,450
Um...

4925
03:52:09,970 --> 03:52:10,850
Cause it's...

4926
03:52:10,850 --> 03:52:11,630
You have to...

4927
03:52:12,930 --> 03:52:17,390
It's a bit more difficult of a national park to get to because it's very mountainous.

4928
03:52:17,930 --> 03:52:19,310
Hold on, I saved it though.

4929
03:52:19,390 --> 03:52:20,970
Cause I was like, I really wanna go here.

4930
03:52:22,290 --> 03:52:22,730
Um...

4931
03:52:22,730 --> 03:52:25,710
But because it's hard to get to, it's like you know...

4932
03:52:26,590 --> 03:52:30,510
It's pretty... secluded and you don't have a lot of people going.

4933
03:52:31,550 --> 03:52:35,270
Wait, what are some of these videos that I saved and they were deleted?

4934
03:52:35,570 --> 03:52:36,830
I hope one of them wasn't that.

4935
03:52:37,210 --> 03:52:37,910
Oh no!

4936
03:52:38,150 --> 03:52:40,710
Maybe I should start saving them to my phone instead of bookmarking them.

4937
03:52:42,450 --> 03:52:42,890
Um...

4938
03:52:44,190 --> 03:52:44,890
No way!

4939
03:52:45,030 --> 03:52:45,750
Was one of them it?

4940
03:52:46,030 --> 03:52:47,830
I saved it not too long ago.

4941
03:52:49,410 --> 03:52:49,850
Oh!

4942
03:52:50,030 --> 03:52:50,690
I found it!

4943
03:52:50,790 --> 03:52:52,190
It's called the Gates...

4944
03:52:52,190 --> 03:52:55,010
Gates of the Arctic National Park.

4945
03:52:55,890 --> 03:53:00,710
And it's America's northernmost second largest national park.

4946
03:53:01,310 --> 03:53:04,730
But it's also the least visited of...

4947
03:53:04,730 --> 03:53:05,170
Oh yeah!

4948
03:53:05,310 --> 03:53:05,770
K.O.

4949
03:53:05,790 --> 03:53:06,210
knew it!

4950
03:53:07,230 --> 03:53:12,390
Yeah, it's also the least visited of the national parks.

4951
03:53:13,490 --> 03:53:14,630
Um... But like...

4952
03:53:14,630 --> 03:53:17,190
The photos are just so insane.

4953
03:53:17,430 --> 03:53:20,030
And I was like, any reason to go to Alaska, baby?

4954
03:53:20,910 --> 03:53:22,070
Good guess, K.O.

4955
03:53:22,090 --> 03:53:22,250
Yeah!

4956
03:53:26,050 --> 03:53:26,790
I've been there?

4957
03:53:26,950 --> 03:53:27,070
Oh!

4958
03:53:27,250 --> 03:53:28,510
What did you think, Clockwork?

4959
03:53:28,550 --> 03:53:29,110
Did you like it?

4960
03:53:29,230 --> 03:53:29,710
How was it?

4961
03:53:33,410 --> 03:53:35,190
I wanna see Glacier National Park too.

4962
03:53:35,250 --> 03:53:35,390
Yeah!

4963
03:53:36,970 --> 03:53:37,890
Gates of the Arctic.

4964
03:53:38,030 --> 03:53:38,450
Got it.

4965
03:53:38,450 --> 03:53:38,830
Thanks, man.

4966
03:53:38,950 --> 03:53:39,530
Yeah, of course!

4967
03:53:41,810 --> 03:53:42,210
Hmm...

4968
03:53:42,210 --> 03:53:43,990
The pics on Wiki look pretty cool.

4969
03:53:44,070 --> 03:53:44,230
Right!

4970
03:53:44,810 --> 03:53:45,730
Happy May Day!

4971
03:53:45,850 --> 03:53:47,590
I'm going on a European cruise this summer!

4972
03:53:47,790 --> 03:53:48,530
So I hope...

4973
03:53:48,530 --> 03:53:50,810
I hope you can travel more as well.

4974
03:53:51,010 --> 03:53:51,450
Oh my gosh!

4975
03:53:51,590 --> 03:53:52,130
Where is it going?

4976
03:53:52,750 --> 03:53:53,530
That's so awesome.

4977
03:53:53,770 --> 03:53:54,810
Cold but very pretty.

4978
03:53:55,690 --> 03:53:57,410
I don't mind the cold so much anymore.

4979
03:53:57,930 --> 03:53:59,070
I went to Antarctica.

4980
03:54:00,070 --> 03:54:02,110
I experienced the cold.

4981
03:54:02,550 --> 03:54:04,570
I experienced the... I don't know.

4982
03:54:04,670 --> 03:54:06,590
Sounds hard to get the coldest place on Earth.

4983
03:54:09,030 --> 03:54:12,050
I experienced the southernmost place on Earth.

4984
03:54:13,170 --> 03:54:15,230
I went to the ends of the Earth.

4985
03:54:15,970 --> 03:54:17,150
Italy and Greece.

4986
03:54:17,790 --> 03:54:18,250
Woo!

4987
03:54:21,270 --> 03:54:22,130
So fun.

4988
03:54:23,710 --> 03:54:24,550
Mike Tyson!

4989
03:54:24,930 --> 03:54:25,890
Thanks for the gifted!

4990
03:54:27,070 --> 03:54:28,630
You went there in the summer though?

4991
03:54:28,810 --> 03:54:30,850
Yeah, because they wouldn't let me go in the winter.

4992
03:54:32,350 --> 03:54:35,550
Though, if there was like a way to do a...

4993
03:54:36,690 --> 03:54:38,490
I mean, I would have to...

4994
03:54:39,630 --> 03:54:41,630
If there was a way to like...

4995
03:54:42,730 --> 03:54:45,650
I don't want to call it an internship but like...

4996
03:54:46,270 --> 03:54:49,830
Maybe it would be considered an internship with the scientists that stay.

4997
03:54:50,310 --> 03:54:58,090
The side that I went on was the west part of Antarctica which is...

4998
03:54:58,470 --> 03:55:10,570
probably maybe the better side to go to right now because that's the side that's actively melting but the east side of Antarctica is actually growing.

4999
03:55:10,910 --> 03:55:14,230
So we might find that Antarctica changes shape.

5000
03:55:14,430 --> 03:55:15,050
You know?

5001
03:55:15,230 --> 03:55:16,130
Like in...

5002
03:55:16,130 --> 03:55:17,630
I mean it's gonna take hundreds of...

5003
03:55:17,630 --> 03:55:18,830
hundreds of years.

5004
03:55:19,430 --> 03:55:22,530
If you guys become a ghost you might be able to see it.

5005
03:55:24,770 --> 03:55:26,110
But it's kind of interesting.

5006
03:55:29,630 --> 03:55:32,930
Shiraishi went to make content so...

5007
03:55:35,510 --> 03:55:36,150
Glacier growth?

5008
03:55:36,350 --> 03:55:36,790
Yippee!

5009
03:55:36,830 --> 03:55:37,210
Yeah!

5010
03:55:38,750 --> 03:55:40,670
I applied to one of those internship thingies.

5011
03:55:40,770 --> 03:55:41,690
I don't think I got in...

5012
03:55:42,310 --> 03:55:42,530
Nooooo!

5013
03:55:43,830 --> 03:55:47,030
That one time my Oshii went to Alaska and saw the northern lights out of my...

5014
03:55:49,370 --> 03:55:50,250
Thank you.

5015
03:55:50,610 --> 03:55:51,810
If I go...

5016
03:55:51,810 --> 03:56:02,130
You can bet your butt that I will film everything and then I can do a best yet to come song cover of it and I have to learn Gaelic.

5017
03:56:02,270 --> 03:56:03,670
And then I will sing it.

5018
03:56:03,810 --> 03:56:09,170
And then I will have the footage in the background just like at the end of MGS1.

5019
03:56:10,990 --> 03:56:11,530
Yeah.

5020
03:56:14,610 --> 03:56:17,050
You can bet your butt that's what would happen.

5021
03:56:21,060 --> 03:56:22,840
What melts freezes elsewhere.

5022
03:56:23,160 --> 03:56:23,540
Cool.

5023
03:56:24,220 --> 03:56:24,760
Yeah.

5024
03:56:24,840 --> 03:56:29,760
Cause you know whenever you hear about Antarctica it's always like pretty grim sounding.

5025
03:56:29,940 --> 03:56:35,200
But when I learned that at least some part of Antarctica was growing.

5026
03:56:35,480 --> 03:56:38,900
I don't know if it's growing at a rate to...

5027
03:56:41,460 --> 03:56:42,360
What's the word?

5028
03:56:43,600 --> 03:56:47,340
Like offset the melting you know but...

5029
03:56:48,420 --> 03:56:49,460
There is hope.

5030
03:56:50,600 --> 03:56:52,440
Ghosts don't belong in Alaska.

5031
03:56:54,400 --> 03:56:56,980
I was busy doing finals and forgot about the stream.

5032
03:56:56,980 --> 03:56:57,280
No.

5033
03:56:57,440 --> 03:56:58,700
That's so much more important.

5034
03:56:58,960 --> 03:56:59,660
I hope you...

5035
03:56:59,660 --> 03:57:01,080
I hope you...

5036
03:57:02,680 --> 03:57:04,400
got them all done and passed.

5037
03:57:10,200 --> 03:57:10,720
But...

5038
03:57:11,540 --> 03:57:12,060
Yeah.

5039
03:57:12,160 --> 03:57:15,620
Thank you guys again for being a little flexible with me and...

5040
03:57:19,860 --> 03:57:21,760
Letting me play balloons today instead.

5041
03:57:22,140 --> 03:57:22,880
Tomorrow though.

5042
03:57:24,620 --> 03:57:25,140
Endurance.

5043
03:57:25,400 --> 03:57:25,920
Endurance.

5044
03:57:26,980 --> 03:57:27,720
I learned it's not nasal.

5045
03:57:28,780 --> 03:57:29,360
Endurance.

5046
03:57:31,140 --> 03:57:32,740
I... I'm nervous.

5047
03:57:34,200 --> 03:57:35,380
To be honest.

5048
03:57:36,000 --> 03:57:37,060
I'm nervous.

5049
03:57:38,900 --> 03:57:39,480
But...

5050
03:57:39,480 --> 03:57:40,440
Um...

5051
03:57:41,060 --> 03:57:41,640
Mmm...

5052
03:57:42,360 --> 03:57:43,740
I played a little bit.

5053
03:57:44,200 --> 03:57:46,760
I like played a little bit last night and I was like...

5054
03:57:46,760 --> 03:57:47,860
Oh god.

5055
03:57:49,640 --> 03:57:52,160
I think I got to stage 3.

5056
03:57:53,200 --> 03:57:56,160
And I think there's 99 stages or something insane.

5057
03:57:57,660 --> 03:57:59,240
Of course it's always a good time with you.

5058
03:57:59,340 --> 03:57:59,500
Yeah.

5059
03:57:59,580 --> 03:58:00,220
Thank you.

5060
03:58:00,800 --> 03:58:02,040
Thank you so much.

5061
03:58:03,160 --> 03:58:06,000
Thank you guys for the funny ice monkey.

5062
03:58:08,040 --> 03:58:10,020
And all the super chats and everything.

5063
03:58:10,360 --> 03:58:12,400
I always appreciate you guys so much.

5064
03:58:13,040 --> 03:58:13,800
Endurance stream?

5065
03:58:14,020 --> 03:58:14,340
Yes.

5066
03:58:14,520 --> 03:58:15,340
Endurance stream.

5067
03:58:17,060 --> 03:58:19,720
I came back from my vacation to Tokyo this month.

5068
03:58:20,060 --> 03:58:20,820
Oh my gosh.

5069
03:58:21,640 --> 03:58:22,120
Otsu.

5070
03:58:24,180 --> 03:58:24,660
Otsu.

5071
03:58:24,800 --> 03:58:25,540
It's gonna be rough.

5072
03:58:25,680 --> 03:58:26,800
It is gonna be rough.

5073
03:58:27,400 --> 03:58:27,920
But...

5074
03:58:28,600 --> 03:58:30,480
Let's all... Let's all... I'm gonna do...

5075
03:58:30,480 --> 03:58:32,520
I'm not... I'm not... It's not... I'm...

5076
03:58:32,520 --> 03:58:33,120
Hold on.

5077
03:58:33,700 --> 03:58:37,800
I am planning on not using save states at all.

5078
03:58:39,320 --> 03:58:39,840
So...

5079
03:58:40,960 --> 03:58:41,480
Um...

5080
03:58:42,800 --> 03:58:44,120
We'll see how that goes.

5081
03:58:44,700 --> 03:58:46,080
What kind of a game is it?

5082
03:58:46,180 --> 03:58:46,980
It's just...

5083
03:58:48,880 --> 03:58:50,680
I know you like MGS.

5084
03:58:50,840 --> 03:58:53,640
I wear an eyepatch and I'm told I kinda look like Big Boss.

5085
03:58:53,980 --> 03:58:54,500
Really?

5086
03:59:01,920 --> 03:59:02,840
How... I mean...

5087
03:59:03,340 --> 03:59:04,220
That's so cool!

5088
03:59:08,390 --> 03:59:09,070
Thumbnail though.

5089
03:59:10,570 --> 03:59:11,030
Roy!

5090
03:59:11,150 --> 03:59:12,510
Welcome to Mambusha!

5091
03:59:12,570 --> 03:59:13,210
Thank you!

5092
03:59:13,570 --> 03:59:14,470
Thank you, thank you!

5093
03:59:15,950 --> 03:59:17,290
Thank you for the laughs at the stream.

5094
03:59:17,410 --> 03:59:17,630
Yeah.

5095
03:59:17,890 --> 03:59:19,590
Maybe a little save state as a tree?

5096
03:59:19,710 --> 03:59:20,170
No, no.

5097
03:59:20,970 --> 03:59:21,750
No, no, no.

5098
03:59:21,830 --> 03:59:22,530
No save states.

5099
03:59:23,290 --> 03:59:23,750
No.

5100
03:59:24,890 --> 03:59:27,590
I gotta do it with all skill.

5101
03:59:30,110 --> 03:59:31,030
All skill.

5102
03:59:34,190 --> 03:59:35,390
Hopefully we make it.

5103
03:59:37,970 --> 03:59:38,470
Hopefully.

5104
03:59:38,790 --> 03:59:39,870
We will see though.

5105
03:59:41,370 --> 03:59:42,570
We will see.

5106
03:59:43,670 --> 03:59:44,830
Get ready for rage.

5107
03:59:48,770 --> 03:59:49,750
I'll do my best.

5108
03:59:49,970 --> 03:59:53,450
So with that I am gonna go to sleep then because I gotta be up.

5109
03:59:53,750 --> 03:59:54,250
Wait.

5110
03:59:54,710 --> 03:59:55,890
What time is my stream?

5111
03:59:55,970 --> 03:59:58,390
I think it's 2 or 3?

5112
03:59:58,610 --> 03:59:59,370
For my time.

5113
04:00:00,910 --> 04:00:01,410
Uh...

5114
04:00:10,680 --> 04:00:11,760
14 hours from now.

5115
04:00:11,840 --> 04:00:12,400
Sleep time.

5116
04:00:12,540 --> 04:00:13,180
Thank you.

5117
04:00:13,720 --> 04:00:14,520
Oh my gosh.

5118
04:00:14,520 --> 04:00:14,940
You guys.

5119
04:00:17,340 --> 04:00:17,780
Well.

5120
04:00:18,280 --> 04:00:18,880
Actually no.

5121
04:00:19,000 --> 04:00:19,460
Never mind.

5122
04:00:19,640 --> 04:00:23,040
I'll save this for later.

5123
04:00:23,300 --> 04:00:23,960
I'll save this for later.

5124
04:00:25,980 --> 04:00:29,720
You'll have to watch the next episode to find out.

5125
04:00:30,740 --> 04:00:31,540
Atsuminto everybody!

5126
04:00:32,540 --> 04:00:32,980
Atsuminto.

5127
04:00:33,060 --> 04:00:33,720
Actually you know what?

5128
04:00:33,720 --> 04:00:37,380
Since we're here and it's our first time in the new maid cafe.

5129
04:00:39,440 --> 04:00:39,880
Uh...

5130
04:00:40,680 --> 04:00:41,960
I'll let the artist know that I used it.

5131
04:00:41,980 --> 04:00:42,780
She said I could.

5132
04:00:43,960 --> 04:00:47,100
There's actually one other thing that I commissioned from this artist.

5133
04:00:47,380 --> 04:00:47,680
So...

5134
04:00:49,120 --> 04:00:50,300
But it's not done yet.

5135
04:00:50,520 --> 04:00:51,780
I was like waiting.

5136
04:00:51,920 --> 04:00:55,460
I was like maybe I should hold out on showing the background.

5137
04:00:55,580 --> 04:00:57,080
But I was like It's maid day.

5138
04:00:58,340 --> 04:01:03,240
So I do kinda wanna show my new maid cafe on maid day.

5139
04:01:03,800 --> 04:01:04,800
Felt a little perfect.

5140
04:01:06,040 --> 04:01:07,520
Da ba ba ba.

5141
04:01:07,940 --> 04:01:09,500
Da da ba ba ba.

5142
04:01:10,100 --> 04:01:11,720

I saw your streamlabs.

5147
04:01:26,040 --> 04:01:27,800
Thank you for the spooky number!

5148
04:01:28,620 --> 04:01:29,480
Maid channel.

5149
04:01:30,780 --> 04:01:32,120
Oh my gosh I missed this!

04:01:32,380 --> 04:01:32,840
Oh my gosh.

5151
04:01:32,880 --> 04:01:35,200
I'm so... I don't know what's wrong with the sounds.

5152
04:01:35,340 --> 04:01:36,440
This is a sound test.

5153
04:01:36,640 --> 04:01:37,140
Minto cute.

5154
04:01:37,360 --> 04:01:38,320
Minto is extremely cute.

Sorry I didn't give you better seats to the stage but you know.

5167
04:02:12,360 --> 04:02:12,920
Um.

5168

It's just you know.

04:02:14,520 --> 04:02:16,500
It's a pretty crowded day you know.

5170
04:02:16,720 --> 04:02:17,900

I'm so sorry about the streamlabs though.

5179
04:02:34,440 --> 04:02:39,420
I will see what is wrong with them so that the sounds come back.
