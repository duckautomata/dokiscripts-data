1
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,620
Wind.

2
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,880
In my ear.

3
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,040
Windy.

4
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,720
Let's see this.

5
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,780
I'm getting trauma.

6
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,940
My trauma.

7
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,280
My trauma.

8
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,980
My trauma.

9
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,060
Welcome.

10
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,120
Welcome.

11
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,260
We don't use the three word around here.

12
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:37,720
oh my gosh oh did you guys watch gamescom uh that was this week it was the other day right um I caught I don't remember when I came in it was Joffrey saying something that I was like wow what a lot oh I came in when Joffrey was like he was like that's right I can like I came in,

13
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,700
I opened the stream at this line.

14
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:48,960
He was like, I can say that Hollow Knight will come out, or Silk Song will come out this year!

15
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,420
That he's, like, as soon as I opened up the stream, that's what he said.

16
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,420
And I was like, whoa!

17
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,000
Lana, thank you so much for the redirect.

18
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,800
Thank you!

19
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,920
Thank you, thank you!

20
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,700
Welcome, welcome!

21
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,680
Yeah, but, um...

22
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,140
Yeah, well, why?

23
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:38,560
Oh, I was talking about Gamescom because There was one point when they were like This game people have been waiting For so long For so long And people in the chat were like Half-Life, Half-Life 3 Half-Life 3, Half-Life 3 And And it was that Warhammer game I was like No way can you imagine if Half-Life 3 ever got announced while I'm playing the series.

24
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,880
That would be insane.

25
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,700
But wouldn't be the first time.

26
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm pretty good luck when it comes to that kind of stuff, maybe.

27
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,680
But yeah, I watched Gamescom.

28
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,020
I thought it was very funny that the only time the chat...

29
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,200
I don't usually, like, look at the chat because they're always, like...

30
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,820
You know, they're just, like, a bunch of 10-year-olds that are...

31
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:38,540
are really that are really annoying but the chat united for one single game there was one game that that the whole chat was just like win win ww yes it's peak it's peak yes yes based uh whatever yes horrid professor guessed it lego batman it was like seeing world peace It was amazing.

32
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,220
Everybody united for Lego Batman.

33
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,060
I was shocked.

34
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,720
And then.

35
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,120
And then I got a fan edit on TikTok of Lego Batman.

36
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,980
And, um, that game is kind of BL.

37
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
So I kind of want to play it now.

38
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:24,520
talks to the Joker and he's just like there is no us and then the Joker cries and then Batman later on is just like help me fix us and I'm like whoa whoa yeah

39
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:40,600
he says I don't do ships he says that that is the movie wait there's a Lego Batman movie okay now I want to watch the movie and play

40
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,080
It's so funny that, like, overall...

41
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,380
Bald, thank you!

42
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,980
Today is my birthday!

43
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,320
That's not important, Silk Song!

44
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,940
Happy birthday, Bald!

45
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:11,060
But it's so funny that, like, pretty much the Lego games are so highly regarded.

46
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,940
Like, why?

47
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,280
Why?

48
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,680
That's a Lego Batman movie, but Lego Batman 2 is Batman Super Batman BL!

49
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,840
What is this?

50
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,840
What is this?

51
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,660
Wait until you get to the part where Batman and Joker play basketball together.

52
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,580
Ooh, la la.

53
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,980
Silk Song isn't coming out this year.

54
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,740
It comes out in... Wait, two weeks?

55
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,420
soon?

56
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,320
I actually, I saw people talking about, like I saw Kiara she was like, I wish I had played it, played Halo Knight sooner.

57
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,380
But two weeks is crazy.

58
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,140
I think I saw Doki saying that she was going to play Halo Knight all next week or something.

59
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,460
September 4th?

60
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,300
Wow.

61
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,400
Wow.

62
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,440
That's crazy.

63
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,860
Next week, I'm gonna...

64
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,660
So, I leave...

65
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,280
I go to MGSCon this weekend.

66
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:25,820
So, if some of you guys might be at MGSCon, or some of you guys might be watching MGSCon, or some of you guys might be at...

67
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,840
What else?

68
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,580
Anime, NYC.

69
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
I hope you guys have a fun weekend.

70
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,840
Doing...

71
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,920
Whatever...

72
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,880
With whatever you got going on.

73
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,180
Yeah.

75
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,680
Um...

76
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,760
Enjoy NYC, Mint.

77
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,020
I...

78
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,780
I...

79
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,240
I just said I was going to MGSCon.

80
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,440
Um...

81
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,860
That's, uh...

82
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,480
Other side of the country.

83
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,840
Yeah.

84
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,580
I didn't actually realize that I was on the same weekend as AMYC, so I'm glad I didn't plan anything to plan for AMIC.

85
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,900
But next week, next Tuesday, I can play Delta.

86
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,160
So I'm gonna be playing it all day, baby.

87
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,220
Probably start to finish in one go.

88
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,660
Yeah.

89
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,960
So I go from MGSCon straight to Delta.

90
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,480
I'm very, very excited.

91
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

92
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,700
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:53,000
I want to play it the whole thing all the way through yeah i'm gonna be starting early in the day and probably finishing who knows honestly

94
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:09,400
it took me a bajillion times trying to get that line at the very beginning it's stuck in your head i'm suffering from a self perpetuating cycle song stuck in the head listen to song song continues to stay stuck in the head.

95
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,320
Yeah, you should listen more.

96
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,000
More, more, more!

97
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,020
Also, Darth Clone, welcome back, Darko!

98
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,080
I did watch the Metal Gear launch trailer.

99
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,740
I did.

100
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,740
Looks so good.

101
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,040
Yeah, it will be an endurance stream, but like, I'll be- I'll be so full of energy.

102
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,860
full of energy.

103
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,120
Have you seen the new wild hint students in Blue Archive?

104
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,380
Are those the new JP girlies?

105
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,860
Is Kanoui the zombie looking one?

106
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,020
Because if so, yes.

107
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,620
I don't remember their names yet, though.

108
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,280
My baseball team is blowing chunks again.

109
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,320
What does that mean?

110
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,020
They're not good.

111
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,860
Is your baseball team bad?

112
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,100
I need some mint therapy.

113
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,480
Yeah, we'll play B-B-B We'll be playing a little bit of half-life, too, again today.

114
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,620
I don't...

115
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,660
I...

116
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,560
Ravenholm!

117
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,300
I know why they say don't go.

118
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,620
I don't want to go back.

119
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,480
I don't...

120
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,700
I don't want to go back.

121
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,220
Since the Ghost Mead Cafe is closed, lame, on my birthday.

122
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:32,880
Sunday!

123
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,780
Gotta get an early happy birthday wish.

124
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,540
Asha!

125
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,620
Happy birthday!

126
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,100
birthday, I'm sorry.

127
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,900
Guys, what if I wear double glasses?

128
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,820
Extra smart.

129
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,300
Whoa!

130
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,910
It's giving me it.

131
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,670
It's giving me it.

132
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,840
It's giving me X-ray vision!

133
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,660
I can see the future!

134
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,540
Four ears and four eyes.

135
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,480
But today, I'm just normal glasses.

136
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,900
Six eyes.

137
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,660
Oh, I guess it would be six eyes.

138
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,360
Yeah.

139
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,500
Yeah.

140
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,260
Six eyes.

141
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,820
Hentai.

142
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,180
What do you mean by that?

143
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,500
What with my x-ray vision?

144
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,780
You don't want me to see your tidy whitties?

145
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,680
Shall we get into it?

146
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,300
Shall we get into it?

147
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,260
Oh, I think we shall

148
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,240
I actually opened up the correct game this time.

149
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,240
I opened up the right game this time, so...

150
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,360
Let's go.

151
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,860
I went out of there.

152
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,160
I went out of there.

153
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,300
This is the right one, right?

154
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,700
I think so.

155
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:09,870
Music.

156
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,690
Okay, what do I got here?

157
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,950
Grenade, we're on the shoddy SMG.

158
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,230
Revolver.

159
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,290
Oh, this thing?

160
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,410
If I press G, it comes out.

161
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,550
How do I use this thing again?

162
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,010
Oh, I think that's the blast and then this is like if I want to pick stuff up.

163
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,490
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,330
Come here, come here.

165
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:37,810
Whoa!

166
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:43,930
Oh!

167
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,250
Wait, I don't hear the...

168
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:48,770
Mmm soup.

169
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,770
Wait, is it this?

170
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:52,630
No.

171
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,370
How do I hear the soup?

172
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:56,990
Soup.

173
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,270
I don't hear it.

174
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,160
Is it a failure to grab?

175
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,440
Oh!

176
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,740
Mmm soup.

177
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,700
Mmm soup.

178
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,300
Oh!

179
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,520
I'll take that.

180
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:29,920
Aww.

181
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,720
Mr.

182
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,600
Well, clearly we don't go that way.

183
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:38,540
Okay.

184
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,040
Soup.

185
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,700
Thank you.

186
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,580
Any info for digital pass holders and how that's gonna work?

187
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,760
Mint GS Con VTuber Ambassador Hostess.

188
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,940
What do you mean how it's gonna work?

189
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,320
Like.

190
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,100
Ugh.

191
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,200
Like.

192
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,560
For the digital tickets.

193
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,160
Like the stream?

194
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,170
Yeah.

195
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,310
I think there should be an email, no?

196
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,810
They just put out a message on Kickstarter.

197
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,530
Like, how do we access?

198
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,130
I would.

199
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,470
Check your email.

200
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,170
I don't know anything about the inner workings, I'm sorry.

201
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,530
But I can tell you I'll be there in the morning.

202
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,070
I'll be there a little bit after it will.

203
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,830
On stream, I have a thing in the morning.

204
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,970
And if all goes well, I'll be in 3D, which is kind of fun.

205
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,350
And then...

206
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,070
I'll be doing a little something with Miss Cynthia later.

207
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,770
And then...

208
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:14,410
Not to just spoil everything, but in case you wanted to know if you wanted to know what to watch, to see me.

209
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,610
Sorry, I'm eating a cough drop.

210
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,590
And then I will be doing a little bit of karaoke.

211
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,650
Just to kind of start it off at the very end.

212
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,190
So...

213
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,050
That should be everything.

214
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,170
I just got the mail about how it's going to work.

215
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,230
There you go.

216
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,510
Yeah, everyone who got a virtual pass for MGSCon, please check.

217
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,690
No!

218
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,310
Check your e-brill.

219
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,370
Oh, waste and bullets.

220
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,670
Still feels loud, but I'll adjust audio as I go along.

221
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,350
Sorry, guys.

222
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,630
Oh, that's right.

223
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,670
Um...

224
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,690
What is that?

225
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,970
Also, why don't I remember how to smash these?

226
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,230
Oh, wait, I do.

227
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,310
I'm silly.

228
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:19,910
Sorry.

229
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,270
It's like, what do I use to smash?

230
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,590
I remember.

231
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,690
Um, what is that?

232
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,790
Oh, it's coming from up there.

233
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,170
Can I see it?

234
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,670
Is there a way to climb?

235
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:34,950
time?

236
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't see anything up there.

237
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,310
Walk into it and find out.

238
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,050
Am I gonna get jump scared?

239
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,310
I'm scared because we're still not out of Ravenholm.

240
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,090
Oh, there he is!

241
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,890
Can he see me?

242
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,370
Is it a sniper?

243
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,670
I thought it was a turret at first, but... What have

244
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,210
you You could tell yourself when you first played MGS3.

245
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,410
I know, right?

246
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,190
I'm trying not to freak out about it.

247
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,670
Because I'm trying to be normal.

248
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,910
They did give me grenades, huh?

249
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,630
Oops.

250
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,480
Uh, okay, hold on.

251
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,740
I'm a little heavy-handed.

252
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,100
Thank you.

253
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,980
Is that our guy?

254
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,700
Hmm.

255
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,220
Nice.

256
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,200
I want his gun.

257
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,560
That's what I want.

258
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,260
First try, absolutely.

259
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,530
These are dead, right?

260
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,210
What the?

261
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,590
The crates were jiggling a little bit.

262
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,190
Where is he?

263
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,430
Oh!

264
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,680
Oh, I see him.

265
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,080
I see him.

266
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,220
Howie!

267
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,540
Oh,

268
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,740
luckily those...

269
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,740
Oh, wait, there is supplies!

270
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,080
Hi!

271
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:56,880
Hey!

272
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,200
Hey!

273
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,620
Hey!

274
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,860
Oh my gosh.

275
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,710
This is messed up!

276
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,100
Oh my god.

277
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,880
Do I need to go when he shoots?

278
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,240
It seems like he takes a second to re- Okay, so he has three shots?

279
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:19,640
Four?

280
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,380
Three?

281
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:20,900
Four?

282
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,940
No, five.

283
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,500
Because there was two over there.

284
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,520
And then I ran over here.

285
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,620
I believe.

286
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,970
Okay, maybe he just gives up after a second.

287
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,270
Maybe it's not like he has to reload.

288
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,410
Hey, chill, chill.

289
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:53,650
Okay.

290
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,330
Alright, um, let's see.

291
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,350
Uh...

292
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,470
I'm running.

293
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,150
How close am I?

294
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,050
Oh my gosh.

295
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,410
The thing's gonna fall on me.

296
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,110
I'm gonna get crushed.

297
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,430
Holy!

298
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,200
That's not fair.

299
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,040
This is unfair.

300
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,440
This is, that's not fair.

301
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,400
Okay.

302
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,240
What is he getting?

303
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,460
Alright.

304
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,360
Oh my gosh, ouch!

305
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,660
I was still crouch.

306
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,060
Chill, chill.

307
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,440
It's just a box!

308
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,780
It's just a box!

309
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,720
Chill, chill!

310
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,980
Oh my gosh.

311
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,800
Try turning your PC clock a week ahead.

312
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,080
I wonder how that will work for...

313
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,760
Oh my god!

314
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,280
Where did that thing come from?

315
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,480
He almost saved me, actually.

316
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,740
I wonder how that will work in Delta though.

317
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,800
If I turn my PC clock up to a week ahead.

318
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:34,980
Alright.

319
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,080
Iki-mas!

320
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:37,940
No!

321
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,880
I missed.

322
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,660
Dang it.

323
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,260
Hut!

324
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,740
Yeah, I got him.

325
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,290
We got it eventually.

326
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,990
Is there any point actually exploring around here now that I think about it?

327
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,130
Full ammo.

328
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,670
Hold on.

329
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,610
Were there any more grenades that I left?

330
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,290
Did I pick up everything?

331
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,610
Let's check.

332
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,970
I'm backtracking like crazy.

333
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,090
Okay, never mind.

334
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:21,650
Okay.

335
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,070
That's fine.

336
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,770
That's fine.

337
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,550
I just want to get out of here, man.

338
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,530
I don't want to be in this chapter anymore.

339
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,630
Wait, does this open?

340
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,120
I don't want to be here.

341
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
It sounds so scary!

342
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,960
Physics are happening.

343
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,280
I can't even get on this.

344
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,260
I have to go under.

345
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,840
Use the grab gun.

346
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:54,880
Oh, true!

347
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,060
But on what?

348
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,400
To get up there?

349
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,960
Oh, wait a second.

350
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,720
Oh!

351
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,500
Sorry, buddy.

352
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,920
There's a little bit of supplies.

353
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,720
It pays to explore.

354
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,660
It really does.

355
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:14,980
Okay.

356
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,700
And there's more grenades here for the future.

357
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,720
More grenades for the future.

358
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,050
What was that?

359
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,030
What did I just grab?

360
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,170
Whatever

361
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,840
that was.

362
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,400
Oh.

363
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,560
I don't want to live well.

364
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,160
Sorry.

365
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,820
Wait, there's another guy.

366
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,440
Another guy?

367
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,420
What did I...

368
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:16,640
Whoa!

369
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,080
Wait, one second.

370
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,740
I'm actually gonna...

371
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,320
Scoop myself down, make myself a little bit smaller.

372
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,680
That should be good.

373
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,100
Whoa, whoa!

374
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,340
Woo!

375
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,200
I got some fancy stuff here.

376
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,740
Okay.

377
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
What is this?

378
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,280
Well, whatever would be here, they would have taken it out, right?

379
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,260
Surely there's nothing left?

380
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,620
Gosh, I'm so paranoid.

381
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,360
I'm absolutely paranoid.

382
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,300
I camped and I'm proud.

383
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
I camped and I'm proud.

384
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,380
I don't care.

385
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,170
What is this?

386
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,690
Oh, more...

387
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,020

Wait!

395
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,240
How are you still alive?

396
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,740
How do I use this thing?

397
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,580
Why does it feel so weak?

398
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,800
Well, I guess I was far away, but...

399
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,880
Does this weapon have alt-fire?

400
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,180
It does, but I have zero.

401
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,900
I'm just gonna...

402
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,500
Oh!

403
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,540
Oh my god.

404
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,320
Oh my god.

405
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,040
Oh my god.

406
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,700
Oh god.

407
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,620
Why are they so smart?

408
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,080
Where are you shooting me from?

409
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,260
I don't play Call of Duty, please!

410
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,570
I guess I have to go in there, but...

411
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,180
Okay, hold on.

412
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,520
What was that gun again?

413
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:45,840
Which...

414
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,280
Overwatch...

415
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,920
standard-issue pulse rifle.

416
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,280
I'm sneaking.

417
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,740
I'm sneaking.

418
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,400
I don't see anybody.

419
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,040
I hear them for sure.

420
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,940
Oh my god!

421
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,160
How do you see me?

422
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,420
How are

423
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,040

424
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,540
Wait.

425
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,400
Okay.

426
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:37,440
I try to blow up the things but i couldn't see them once i ducked oh my god you guys okay

427
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,320
no sneaking in this game clearly

428
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,520

429
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:02,850
i'm going in i hate when i have to fight people let me just fight the zombies

430
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:16,870
I think I got him.

431
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,930
Those are not people?

432
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,350
What do you mean they're not people?

433
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,870
It looks like a people?

434
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:28,770
No?

435
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,890
It looks like a people to me.

436
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,310
Anything in these trucks?

437
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,550
Oh, whoa.

438
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,450
Okay, nice.

439
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,830
They're not people anymore?

440
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,790
Well then I don't feel any remorse killing them.

441
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,710
I don't feel bad at all.

442
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,260
Okay, let's go.

443
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,560
Oh, what's going on?

444
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,900
Please don't spam!

445
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:51,810
Moan?

446
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,190
Who's moaning and groaning?

447
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,580
Wait, who's my friends?

448
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,480
That looks like a bad guy.

449
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,460
Oh, those are my friends!

450
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,060
Winston?

451
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,420
It wasn't me, was it?

452
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,900
That's me!

453
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,120
We've been getting communication from Alex.

454
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,640
I'll see if I can reach her again.

455
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,020
Winston.

456
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,240
Wait, hold on.

457
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,620
Winston.

458
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh, he's moaning.

459
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,260
Can I take your stuff?

460
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,420
No, I have full bullets.

461
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:50,720
Okay.

462
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,080
One second.

463
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,920
Hold on, I'm getting their stuff.

464
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,380
It's really important.

465
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,640
Is Winston gonna make it?

466
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,080
I don't know that guy.

467
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,140
One moment, please.

468
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,400
I'm conducting important research.

469
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,980
Okay.

470
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:44,520

00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,740
so many moaning and groaning people.

472
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,160
Alex, it's Leon, and I've got Gordon Freeman with me.

473
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,000
She just looks like she has a tummy ache.

474
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:56,680
Hi.

475
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,100
Gordon, you made it through Ravenholm.

476
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,740
I did.

477
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,920
Somehow.

478
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,800
I need your help.

479
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,960
They've taken my father.

480
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:05,460
Barely.

481
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,920
He's been taken to Nova Prospect.

482
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,360
The Vortigons tracked the

483
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,950
ship, but I think it's still easier to sneak in than to break out.

484
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,310
You wanted to take the coast road?

485
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,770
Moaning, moaning.

486
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,190
He won't last five minutes on foot.

487
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,250
It's spawning season for the ant lions.

488
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,530
That's why I called you.

489
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,810
What is it?

490
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:34,630
What's that?

491
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,950
That's an ant lion?

492
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:39,810
Yeah, good idea.

493
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:40,770
Hold on a sec.

494
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,250
Mone.

495
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:41,790
Norko?

496
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,130
Bring the buggy out.

497
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,530
Put it on the dock right now.

498
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,770
Gordon Freeman will be driving it.

499
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,150
Good timing.

500
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,310
Good timing.

501
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:51,610
Okay, Alex.

502
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,150
We're all right.

503
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,060
Good timing.

504
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,240
Okay, Alex.

505
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,660
We're all set.

506
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,040
Bye, Alex.

507
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,180
Mone, moan, moan.

508
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:10,600
Bye, Alex.

509
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,180
Before you hit the road, you might want to grab some med kits.

510
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,260
Restock on ammo.

511

00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,660
Shorepoint to New Little Odessa.

00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,400
Come in, Odessa.

521
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,660
I don't think they're coming in.

522
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,960
I think they're...

523
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,020
Highway 17.

524
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,800
Hello, Dr. Freeman.

525
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,300
Hello.

526
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,380
The car's all ready for you.

527
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,840
What are you shooting at?

528
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,440
Hop in and I'll lower you down to the beach.

529
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,900
The beach?

530
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,160
Are those ant lions?

531
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,840
Is that an ant lion?

532
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:15,010
Whose lucky job is it to just sit here and fire all day?

533
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,670
The car's ready for you now, Dr. Freeman.

534
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:18,730
Is he for Zoom?

535
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,670
Thank you.

536
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,050
I forgot that this is a feature.

537
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,710
Oh, they do look like ants.

538
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:31,920
Okay.

539
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:33,960
Wait, what's up there?

540
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,120
One moment, please.

541
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,560
Oh, I can't get... Wait.

542
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,520
Can I?

543
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,840
No.

544
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:40,660
Okay.

545
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,160
I'm going in!

546
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,600
They can leap?

547
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:44,980
Okay.

548
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,660
They look like they're tight.

549
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:48,340
Good.

550
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,180
Here we go.

551
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,900
Shift turbo, space handbrake.

552
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,620
I'm just gonna follow the road.

553
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,440
You think that'll be good enough?

554
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,820
Or...

555
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,640
Don't shoot me.

556
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,980
Don't shoot me, please.

557
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,380
Oh, they look like...

558
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,780
They're about ready to eat me.

559
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,900
Oh, are you kidding me?

560
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,800
Wait.

561
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,200
Ah!

562
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Oh my god!

563
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,230
Help, please!

564
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,550
Get that car up, right?

565
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,670
Get the hell out of here!

566
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,670
Oh, the gravity gun.

567
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:45,650
Uh.

568
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,570
There we go.

569
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:50,730
Okay, now I'm leaving.

570
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:51,550
Bye!

571
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,450
Bye!

572
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,280
twice good thing we don't have a windshield I better not keep my mouth open though while riding this thing

573
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:28,330
um I'm going in a circle um I'm not quite sure where to go I went in a circle okay um cool I'm just getting a feel of it I do have a gun you're right I'm just getting a feel of it, you know?

574
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,630
Along the coast.

575
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,190
Holy loud!

576
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,030
It's so loud.

577
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,040
I'm gonna go this way.

578
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,540
Oh, here we go.

579
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,240
Is this a road?

580
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,260
Maybe not.

581
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,260
I'm lost again.

582
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,400
I'm gonna go along the coast.

583
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,900
Like we said the first time.

584
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,360
Let's not divert from the plan, you know?

585
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,340
Oop, oop, oop.

586
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:18,850
Uh...

587
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,550
Team!

588
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:20,710
Team!

589
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,290
Team!

590
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:22,990
Team!

591
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,190
Team!

592
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:24,910
Team!

593
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:27,610
No good.

594
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,670
Team, we're having a bad time.

595
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:31,550
Team!

596
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,390
Team!

597
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,870
Team!

598
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,390
Maybe I can blast my way out of here.

599
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:39,410
Um...

600
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:39,710
Team!

601
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,910
Team!

602
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:41,750
Team!

603
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,530
I could use some help here.

604
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,230
No kidding, we made it.

605
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,850
Uh, this coast.

606
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,470
I...

607
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:59,890
I've lost this hell.

608
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,790
Do I actually have a map that I could use?

609
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,970
Because, uh, otherwise...

610
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,410
Guys, this ain't looking so good.

611
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:06,990
Uh...

612
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,330
Oh!

613
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,790
Oh!

614
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,330
Wait, I think I need the boost there.

615
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:13,530
Okay, I see.

616
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,030
Ah!

617
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:20,870
We're fine.

618
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,450
Everything's cool.

619
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:29,890
Okay.

620
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:31,670
Uh, wrong way?

621
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,070
Wait a second.

622
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,430
One moment.

623
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,720
One moment, please.

624
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,340
Yeah, we need that, though.

625
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,880
Gamer Paint does it again.

626
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:54,740
Um...

627
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,860
Yes, I apologize for my incompetence.

628
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,560
You're just gonna...

629
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,460
You're just...

630
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,860
I'm sure you're used to it by now, right, everyone?

631
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,180
Okay.

632
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,000
Wait a second.

633
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,040
What's here?

634
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,660
Oh.

635
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,000
Nothing.

636
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,460
I'm too fat.

637
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,200
But I go through here, no?

638
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,780
But there was also...

639
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,850
There was also...

640
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,510
Um...

641
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:33,050
I think I go through there.

642
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,170
Doing fine, Minky.

643
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,470
I think so!

644
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,450
I'll try this way.

645
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,230
Will let me in?

646
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:43,950
Oh.

647
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,590
I'm breaking the law.

648
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,270
Here we go.

649
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,390
Ooh, coming in hot.

650
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,230
Coming in hot!

651
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,190
Thank you.

652
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:00,110
Uh...

653
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,450
That wasn't me.

654
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,190
I like to squash them more than...

655
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:14,930
more than shoot them.

656
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,820
What the hell is this?

657
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:21,980
Oh.

658
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,760
Oh gosh.

659
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,580
It's not behind me either.

660
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,040
Can I go in here?

661
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:32,800
It's locked.

662
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,750
Oh, there's something in there.

663
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,540
Oh, stay near the thumpers.

664
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,360
Is this a thumper?

665
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,090
What is this thing?

666
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:53,690
Lacked.

667
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,010
Oh, look at that.

668
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,070
They're scared.

669
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,650
Whoa, interesting.

670
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,820
But I hear something in there.

671
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,160
Oh,

672
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,380
oh, that's really spooky.

673
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,060
I don't know if I like this.

674
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:45,460
Come here.

675
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,520
You son of a gun.

676
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:49,860
Where'd you go?

677
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,860
Oh, there should be several in here, aren't there?

678
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,680
Oh, gosh.

679
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,020
Oh, I see it.

680
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,740
Why don't you come out?

681
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,960
Not you!

682
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,400
How did you even get out?

683
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:15,960
Oh my god!

684
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,970
I don't... I don't like...

685
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,470
Okay, now I'll be brave.

686
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,490
That's so scary.

687
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,330
Holy...

688
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:37,830
Oh, that's creepy.

689
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,830
How do I get up there, though?

690
00:47:49,260 --> 00:48:07,990
I hear them but like they're all around me and all I'm a little freaked out I think I got him oh I hear it oh my god it's so scary I don't think I can

691
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:39,690
I don't like that I don't like hearing him at all ruthless you gotta be with these things though no I

692
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:46,910
think there's one in here.

693
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:48,090
Oh no.

694
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,570
There we go.

695
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,030
Hehehe.

696
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,420
I can't get over the sound.

697
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,040
Throw a grenade in the room.

698
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,140
I guess we could try that.

699
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:23,730
I hear him still.

700
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:25,630
You hear that?

701
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,290
Try again.

702
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,110
Another?

703
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,850
Okay, I'm just gonna go in.

704
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:48,790
Oopsie.

705
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,490
I'm not going in.

706
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:52,670
I lied.

707
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:54,570
I lied.

708
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:56,350
This

709
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,720
thing!

710
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,500
Oh my god.

711
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:02,920
Hell no.

712
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,420
Oh my gosh.

713
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,680
No wonder it was breathing like that.

714
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:16,860
Nasty.

715
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,460
Nasty, nasty, nasty.

716
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,080
Oh.

717
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,280
Oh, terrible.

718
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:37,960
Okay.

719
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,080
Let's run to the thumper.

720
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,880
Let's run to the thumper.

721
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:57,870
Okay, um, I'm still lost.

722
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,030
I wish I had a map, for real.

723
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:13,860
Push the button.

724
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,960
Are you guys crazy?

725
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,300
Are you guys crazy?

726
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:31,990
Actually, hold on.

727
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:32,790
I just saved.

728
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,350
Let's see what happens when you do.

729
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,590
Do we go

730
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,200
this way?

731
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,360
Nice.

732
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:51,780
Whoa!

733
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,300
Whoa!

734
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,560
Sea tour!

735
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,140
Never mind.

736
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:13,870
Uh-oh.

737
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:14,430
Oh.

738
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:15,250
Shoot.

739
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:16,750
Uh, guys.

740
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,390
How do I reload?

741
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,350
Well, they don't like water.

742
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:22,990
Yes, they do.

743
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:28,770
Gravity gun it!

744
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:29,330
Okay.

745
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:31,870
Wait, okay, hold on.

746
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:46,360
Okay, we're probably fine now.

747
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:49,390
No, we're not fine.

748
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:50,170
Oh, shoot.

749
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,110
Go away.

750
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:51,770
Uh.

751
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,290
Stop!

752
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,180
Now we're probably fine.

753
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,100
There we go.

754
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:08,900
Holy cow.

755
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,260
We go so fast.

756
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,460
Okay.

757
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,530
I heard...

758
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,060
I heard radios.

759
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,280
I heard radios.

760
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,270
Chill!

761
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,560
Oh gosh.

762
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,260
Wait.

763
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,500
Go away.

764
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,620
Back!

765
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,340
Back, you beasts!

766
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,200
Oh, they're killing them too.

767
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:03,840
Ow!

768
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:04,460
Back!

769
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,640
Back, you beast.

770
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,440
Let's see.

771
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,820
How do I want to kill these guys?

772
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,300
Oh!

773
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,600
Like that.

774
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,040
That works.

775
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,930
Anything in here?

776
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:33,050
I feel like you can't trust a single place ever.

777
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:36,830
Whoa.

778
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:38,890
How do we get in there?

779
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:52,850
Oh, hey, we'll use this guy.

780
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,130
I'm running low on shotgun bullets.

781
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,290
What are they dropping?

782
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,190
What ammo are they even dropping here?

783
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,100
Oh.

784
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,280
What is this?

785
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,740
They were...

786
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,860
Those are my friends.

787
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,400
They're spying on my friends.

788
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,480
Why?

789
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,260
Oh, perverts they are.

790
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:24,720
Voyors...

791
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,500
Wait, G- I waited.

792
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,100
Where'd you see G-Man at?

793
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,640
The suitcase at the top of the building.

794
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,140
Oh, the guys that were having the meeting?

795
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,060
How can you guys tell when it's him or not?

796
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,440
Wait, why is he talking to my friends then?

797
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,220
That's not good, huh?

798
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,320
That's not good, huh?

799
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:14,300

00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,790
I'll keep that in mind.

805
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,300
Oh, John!

806
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,740
I thought I ran you over.

807
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:48,770
Ouch!

808
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,730
It was worth it.

809
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,030
Wait, they have a better car.

810
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,210
Yeah, yeah.

811
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:14,310
I'm

812
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,000
taking this stuff.

813
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:26,140
Leave me alone.

814
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,760
Oh my gosh, finally some health.

815
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,520
Wait, I feel like I'm not going to make this.

816
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:39,540
No.

817
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,220
Oh.

818
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:41,840
Oh.

819
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,620
Oh.

820
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,520
Okay, that's fine too.

821
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,460
Grab gun.

822
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,360
That's fine.

823
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,260
You missed me, dummy.

824
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,160
Can I take this?

825
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:07,560
No!

826
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,400
They're like, you do not have the proper license.

827
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,180
The authority.

828
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,040
Dang.

829
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,940
Okay, well, I took care of those guys.

830
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,340
Onwards.

831
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:26,980
We go.

832
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:34,120
It sucks that they just continuously spawn, otherwise I would stop by the boats and stuff, but, you know.

833
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,700
What's up there?

834
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,060
How do I get up there?

835
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,180
Hmm.

836
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:44,760
Okay.

837
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:49,880
We got a thing here, but there's literally nothing around.

838
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,860
Okay, that's cool.

839
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,760
Not a sightseeing tour.

840
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,740
Unfortunately, yeah.

841
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:00,620
Um.

842
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,120
Are you good?

843
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:07,640
Gordon Freeman.

844
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,480
That's me.

845
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,440
Hurry, get in the basement.

846
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,440
We're expecting gunships at any moment.

847
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,360
Gunships?

848
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:14,600
Colonel Cabbage?

849
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,100
We'll be glad to see you made it.

850
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,060
Colonel Cabbage.

851
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,400
One moment.

852
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,140
I will wait on your gunships.

853
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,780
Wait, how do, why don't the lions, the ant lions spawn here?

854
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,460
What are those?

855
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,200
Okay, that's exciting.

856
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,560
Love that.

857
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,180
Only on sand.

858
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:48,140
Oh, I didn't realize.

859
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:50,600
Ah!

860
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,840
I'd get into the basement if I were you.

861
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,340
We're bracing for an attack.

862
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,100
You scared me, mister.

863
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:03,710
Oh, hi.

864
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:04,150
Okay.

865
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:06,370
I'm just...

866
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,170
I'm taking your things just a little bit real quick.

867
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:10,470
What is this?

868
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:11,250
What is that for?

869
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:12,810
Some sort of alternate...

870
01:01:12,830 --> 01:02:16,330
I don't know what for there's much of it which makes me concerned okay into the basement oh wait there's another shack hold on more oh no golly gee oh please this steerable rocket launcher is our best bet for taking down a gunship take that ah hello hello I'll be right with you okay where was I yes using the laser guide you can steer your rocket past the gunship's defenses and prevent it from shooting down your rocket oh anger it at first but if you can survive long enough to make several direct hits you'll be rewarded with a prize worthy of any mantelpiece now who's going to be the lucky one to carry it into combat oh yes they both look at me I couldn't have asked for a finer volunteer I did Colonel Odessa Cubbage at your service.

871
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:16,610
Ah!

872
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:19,630
Oh!

873
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:21,770
Gunship!

874
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:26,550
Let me just send a warning to Lighthouse Point, and then I'll come right up and lend a hand.

875
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:35,370
Remember, use the launcher's laser guide to steer your rockets past the gunship's defenses.

876
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:38,690
Oh!

877
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:40,890
Oh, look, they're Maddox!

878
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:41,850
Or he is.

879
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:45,310
Um...

880
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,510
Did I get it?

881
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:56,290
Is there a good place to go for this?

882
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:01,070
Is there a good place I can shoot you from here?

883
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,390
Okay.

884
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,540
Okay, the glass is like indestructible here.

885
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,120
Okay.

886
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,780
Oh my god!

887
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,060
Thank you!

888
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:32,580
Oh my gosh!

889
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,720
They were giving me ammo and stuff.

890
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,300
That's so cute.

891
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,360
I'm

892
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:42,230
running right into it.

893
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:42,910
Oh,

894
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,080
I have no ammo.

895
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,340
I have ammo in here.

896
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:51,900
Thank you.

897
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,800
I'm stuck on the wall.

898
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,240
Thank you.

899
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,320
Thank you very much.

900
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:09,210
Is that it?

901
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:14,050
Defend a little Odessa from the gunship attack.

902
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,370
I'll take more, just in case.

903
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:18,850
No!

904
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:20,970
I just talked to him.

905
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:24,810
Yes.

906
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,260
I guess there's no more carrots.

907
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,260
They look like big old carrots, right?

908
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,420
I think there was some downstairs.

909
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:42,880
Are you okay?

910
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,260
Get going, Dr. Freeman.

911
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,520
We know Eli Vance is depending on you.

912
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,100
Okay.

913
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,600
Where am I going?

914
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,020
Wait, what's in here?

915
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,660
Is there stuff on the roof?

916
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,360
Damn indestructible window.

917
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,120
It would have been first try, otherwise.

918
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,960
If the window wasn't in distra- I had a plan, you guys.

919
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,120
You can't fault me for...

920
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:10,620
You know.

921
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,680
No one would have known...

922
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,380
Or no one could have known that the...

923
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,520
That you can't...

924
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,600
That you can't shoot out the window.

925
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:33,850

931
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,150
Most dire.

932
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:16,990

Disgusting.

948
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,560
I'm not drunk driving!

949
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,840
I'm driving very normally.

950
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,300
Very calmly and safely.

951
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,300
I might hit a few men.

952
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,720
I missed one.

953
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:34,180
Ah!

954
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,520
Oh shoot.

955
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:41,900
Don't shoot me.

956
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,500
Oh!

957
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,540
Uh oh, that doesn't sound good.

958
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:52,070
Uh, that didn't sound good.

959
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:55,310
I see them over there.

960
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,310
I wish I had a sniper.

961
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:59,330
I'd be able to get them so easily if I had a sniper.

962
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:03,630
I could use my new...

963
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:03,910
I

964
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:14,290
thought the water was more shallow, okay?

965
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:21,740
Hmm.

966
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,620
Can I hit them?

967
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:26,820
Oh my gosh.

968
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:28,080
Oh my god.

969
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:28,720
Oh my god.

970
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,340
Oh my god.

971
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,660
That scared the heck out of me.

972
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:38,180
me what happened there oh my god

973
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:45,240
trying to hit them i'm

974
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,400
trying to hit them with my gun

975
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:06,040
not doing such a great job i'm just gonna go in circles killing

976
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,510
men is just as important as killing creatures

977
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:22,230
Minor lacerations.

978
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:24,450
I'm going in circles again.

979
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:24,790
Oh!

980
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:30,370
Oh, I tried to get that supply box, but I didn't get it.

981
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:31,650
Yeah.

982
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:32,530
Equality!

983
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:35,910
Oh.

984
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:44,230
It's not fun having the little guys on top of you as well as these guys on top of you.

985
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:47,490
These guys are also shooting at you.

986
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:04,640
Okay.

987
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,040
Okay.

988
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:07,620
Oh.

989
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,340
Uh, that's not my gun.

990
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:15,250
Oh, he's not even focusing on me.

991
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:16,470
That's nice.

992
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:17,810
Wait.

993
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:18,610
There it is.

994
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:19,270
Oh my gosh.

995
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:21,190
Okay.

996
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,490
I finally turned it on.

997
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:25,690
Okay.

998
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:29,030
Holy cow.

999
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:29,750
Okay.

1000
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:33,190
Somehow.

1001
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:35,350
Okay.

1002
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:37,170
Yeah.

1003
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,610
Yeah, we parked right next to the thumper.

1004
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,380
Safe for now.

1005
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:55,320
Don't you dare.

1006
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:56,440
Don't you dare.

1007
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:57,540
Don't you dare.

1008
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:05,740
Oh,

1009
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,240
that guy's dead.

1010
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,760
I guess then we can go up.

1011
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:20,940
I did save, right?

1012
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:21,840
I think I did.

1013
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,300
Did they come up here?

1014
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,440
Or did they just stay on the sand in general?

1015
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:33,500
Woo!

1016
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,400
Eep!

1017
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:47,940
Oh.

1018
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:55,890
That was close.

1019
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:56,850
Oh my gosh.

1020
01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:00,730
I saw a supply box in there.

1021
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:01,590
I just need to...

1022
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:02,150
I think it was?

1023
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:11,270
I don't know if that got the guy.

1024
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,490
I definitely did not.

1025
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:22,150
He's fast.

1026
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:26,450
I hear the other guy.

1027
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:29,050
He's just going off on the...

1028
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:29,550
Oh!

1029
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:33,070
Oh my god!

1030
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:35,670
Unfair!

1031
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:39,410
There's

1032
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,300
nobody else?

1033
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,660
Oh, what's that?

1034
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:47,980
Lucky.

1035
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,000
Maybe?

1036
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,000
There's nobody else?

1037
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,280
These.

1038
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,660
This is what I was trying to do.

1039
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,080
You know what?

1040
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,740
Honestly, it's a good thing I waited to grab them.

1041
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,020
I really needed them.

1042
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,180
Okay, nice.

1043
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,080
Let me get my gun out.

1044
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,320
Not the shotgun.

1045
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,280
We'll use this one again.

1046
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,360
But where?

1047
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:33,820
Don't go carah.

1048
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,100
Actually, I'm gonna save.

1049
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,420
Okay, there we go.

1050
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:37,720
Alright.

1051
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:38,860
One more.

1052
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,220
Is it just him?

1053
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,940
Is it just him?

1054
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,140
Use the crossbow.

1055
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:12,680
I don't have a crossbow.

1056
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:14,040
What are you talking about?

1057
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:18,560
Use the thing you don't have.

1058
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:23,220
Oh,

1059
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:31,780
not, not, not Grenade.

1060
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,400
No, not you either.

1061
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:33,900
You.

1062
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,700
Let's go back to this.

1063
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:46,630
Oh, there's supplies down here, though.

1064
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:48,850
Always appreciated.

1065
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:54,090
I'll take whatever you got.

1066
01:15:56,490 --> 01:16:06,690
it's crazy how i guess you guys say they're not humans right they're like robots or whatever i guess that would make sense why they oh oh what am i doing

1067
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:18,900
oh i made a mistake suddenly there's music wait i don't even know what i'm supposed to do

1068
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:31,880
the cool music can stop you need to do that yeah but i wanted to look around to see what I need to pick up.

1069
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,140
Maybe the car?

1070
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,120
Oh, it's a puzzle.

1071
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,020
Let's see.

1072
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:55,370
Moment?

1073
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:57,730
Okay, so I can't even get up there.

1074
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:01,630
Or, oh, wait.

1075
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:03,990
Is the goal to lower this?

1076
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,780
I like how people are just like...

1077
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,370
Move the crane around.

1078
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:28,030
Yeah, with my eyes first.

1079
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:28,790
Thank you.

1080
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,110
It's called a little thing called patience.

1081
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:35,950
You know, you might not have it, but uh...

1082
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:36,910
Did that just open up?

1083
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:38,270
Oh, hell no.

1084
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:40,810
Oh hell no!

1085
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:45,590
No, wait!

1086
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:49,730
Oh, it's swinging too much!

1087
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:50,230
Ah!

1088
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:54,310
Oh, now they're all the way over there.

1089
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,200
I don't know, I don't control this thing.

1090
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,020
I'm trying to smush them.

1091
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,460
And drop.

1092
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,940
Did I get them?

1093
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,780
Oh, no, it surely did not.

1094
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,280
Uh, good thing they have stormtrooper aim.

1095
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,840
Why won't it lift anymore?

1096
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:32,560
Eh?

1097
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,220
Eh?

1098
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,380
I can't get it to lift it.

1099
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,440
I don't know how to pull up.

1100
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,140
That's an issue.

1101
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,920
Oh, it's down.

1102
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:46,840
Okay, okay.

1103
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,040
Kill three enemies using the crane.

1104
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,320
Oh.

1105
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:21,940
Yeah, good enough.

1106
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:38,130
Anyway.

1107
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:54,680
Questing back up.

1108
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:55,280
Is that what you have?

1109
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,160
No other guys?

1110
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:04,780
So far?

1111
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,400
Yeah, backseaters are going crazy.

1112
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:10,920
But it's okay.

1113
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:11,820
I'm still having fun.

1114
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,080
I'm just ignoring people.

1115
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,580
Minto loves the vehicle environment.

1116
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:17,140
Killstoret.

1117
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:17,900
Yes.

1118
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:27,120
It's my first time playing, so you know, probably won't see everything immediately first time.

1119
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:29,380
Just how it is.

1120
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:39,850
If we fall down there, it's sudden death.

1121
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:45,310
I'm trying to see if this is open or not.

1122
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,570
Nope, okay.

1123
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:47,990
Alright.

1124
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:50,150
Okie dokie.

1125
01:20:55,810 --> 01:21:05,830
I'm gonna switch to my shotgun Because it seems like we might be getting nice and close and personal with these fellas In here

1126
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:10,990
Do I need my car?

1127
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:14,290
Do I need to Oh wait a second

1128
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:26,870
Oh gosh Oh gosh Once I Once I If I pull this, I'm afraid of what will happen.

1129
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:30,330
No calling for backup.

1130
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:34,600
Maybe.

1131
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:50,820
Oh, it opened this.

1132
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:51,860
Okay.

1133
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:56,520
Hello?

1134
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:22,830
She was saying hello back?

1135
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:26,570
Where?

1136
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:27,330
What?

1137
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:34,730
Kind of, there we go.

1138
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:36,330
Oh, that didn't work at all.

1139
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:45,240
Okay.

1140
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:47,740
I love explodey barrels.

1141
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,560
It was a flare.

1142
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:52,420
Oh, no.

1143
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,780
Were they calling more people?

1144
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:55,680
Nasty.

1145
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,740
Nasty work.

1146
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:02,620
How many of you are in there?

1147
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:05,720
One.

1148
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,120
Wait, are you a friend?

1149
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:07,560
No.

1150
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:09,380
No.

1151
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,120
I don't think that worked.

1152
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:13,840
That's okay.

1153
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:24,110
Ah!

1154
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:27,450
I think I need to drive my car up there, huh?

1155
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:28,930
Oh.

1156
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:32,490
I need to drive my car up through there, huh?

1157
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:34,930
Okay, interesting.

1158
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,480
Ding, ding, ding!

1159
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,540
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1160
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,100
I've learned your ways, game.

1161
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:55,800
I've learned your ways.

1162
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,680
Can I get up top here?

1163
01:23:59,620 --> 01:23:59,700
Soup.

1164
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:06,170
I just always want to climb.

1165
01:24:07,050 --> 01:24:07,350
Wait a second.

1166
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:08,110
Here, here, here.

1167
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:11,550
Look.

1168
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:14,690
But there's nothing even here.

1169
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:16,550
So lame.

1170
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:19,510
There's something on top.

1171
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:21,350
What's the point of being able to climb?

1172
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:56,530
I guess they're just like, if you want a gravity gun, everybody here's a bunch of fun things for your pleasure okay let's go get my car wait a second no i'm silly before we do that let's go clear let's go make sure this area over here is clear which i have a feeling it is not i have an inkling of a feeling Or?

1173
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:11,540
Maybe I did.

1174
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:14,320
Hello?

1175
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,720
Maybe I was wrong.

1176
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,640
It's quiet.

1177
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,200
Only ghosts.

1178
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:30,320
Me.

1179
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:33,260
Yeah, I'm definitely here.

1180
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,340
Only me.

1181
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,880
Please do not block me.

1182
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:41,980
No, it's like, Lays.

1183
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,860
Do not block front of building.

1184
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,400
All right, all right.

1185
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,540
Let's go get my car.

1186
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:59,200
I'm really glad that the guys in this game don't, like, have patrols.

1187
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,100
You know, like, with Metal Gear, they're just like, okay, my patrol's over.

1188
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,300
Time to swap out with a new group of people.

1189
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:05,900
It's not an inkling.

1190
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,080
It's a minkling.

1191
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,060
Okay, I need to put my car...

1192
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,100
What the heck was that?

1193
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:17,100
I need to put it, like, right here.

1194
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,600
This isn't really a stealth game.

1195
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,470
Yeah, I wish they just...

1196
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:34,190
I don't want to be perceived.

1197
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,850
Oh, I was like, where'd the ladder go?

1198
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:42,850
Okay, car!

1199
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:45,530
Tract arm.

1200
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:46,590
Meow.

1201
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:54,410
It's not really...

1202
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:56,490
It doesn't really feel like Gordon's.

1203
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,810
style, though, huh?

1204
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:00,050
To be sneaky.

1205
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:05,350
It doesn't seem like the type.

1206
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:14,100
I hope this goes better than when I did the crane games for those Metal Gear mugs.

1207
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:33,010
I get so much I couldn't tell.

1208
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,390
Okay, that should be good.

1209
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,140
Oh, Are you okay?

1210
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,000
What's all that like?

1211
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,190
It's a lot of creaking and cracking.

1212
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,770
I think it needs to be over a little bit.

1213
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,040
Easy.

1214
01:28:56,090 --> 01:29:00,100
How dare you doubt my strategy?

1215
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,060
Nice toss.

1216
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:03,740
Thank you.

1217
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,460
All right.

1218
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,660
How dare you doubt my...

1219
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:11,160
Wait, I could have just put it over there.

1220
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,680
Oh, maybe I should have.

1221
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,160
Oops.

1222
01:29:24,820 --> 01:29:25,620
Okay, anyway.

1223
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:29,360
I wanted to go over the bridge!

1224
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,080
Oh, Jesus.

1225
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,660
Does it fit?

1226
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,420
Or is it me?

1227
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:41,540
Okay.

1228
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:43,920
Okay.

1229
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,460
One more time.

1230
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:08,820
No, come back up.

1231
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,440
Oh, don't swing.

1232
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:25,640
Don't swing, please.

1233
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:26,560
Don't swing.

1234
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:30,820
Yeah.

1235
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:35,460
I feel like I'm forklift certified right now.

1236
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,920
I feel like I should get my I feel like I've earned something.

1237
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:43,960
Crane lift certified.

1238
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,320
Why do I get stuck here?

1239
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,760
That's probably what happened.

1240
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:55,420
Oh my gosh.

1241
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,940
I saw the blue on that thing, and I thought it was a person running at me.

1242
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:02,860
Oh.

1243
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,100
Let's go!

1244
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:23,250
My car is probably...

1245
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:23,810
Oh.

1246
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:25,510
Uh-oh.

1247
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:26,190
Uh-oh.

1248
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:27,050
Uh-oh.

1249
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:27,530
Uh-oh.

1250
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:28,110
Uh-oh.

1251
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:31,210
Oh, I missed.

1252
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:32,050
Um.

1253
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:41,500
Ah!

1254
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,340
Oh, my gosh.

1255
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:42,820
I was.

1256
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:43,480
I was.

1257
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,280
Do I need to get out and fight this thing?

1258
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,480
Na-na-na-na-na-na-da-na.

1259
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,460
Oh, no.

1260
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:07,380
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

1261
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:07,760
Uh.

1262
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:08,660
This.

1263
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,260
Oh my gosh, he shoots me down.

1264
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:19,180
Yeah.

1265
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:20,800
Uh-oh.

1266
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:29,170
Oh, wait, the sand guys can get me here.

1267
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:29,410
No?

1268
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:30,130
No, they can't.

1269
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:31,430
Uh.

1270
01:32:33,490 --> 01:32:34,570
Rockets in the van.

1271
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:35,210
Ow!

1272
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:35,690
Ows!

1273
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:36,710
Ows, ows, ows, ows, ows!

1274
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:39,270
This is really evil.

1275
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:42,250
Having no sprint here is really bad.

1276
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:44,370
Oh, please, please.

1277
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:47,050
In the van.

1278
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:48,110
Oh, I see it.

1279
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:52,270
Um, can I get them, please?

1280
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:53,630
Can you...

1281
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:55,810
Please, let me open the van, please!

1282
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,440
How do I get in there?

1283
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:02,800
Oh, there's a side door.

1284
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,440
Oh my gosh.

1285
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,500
Open up!

1286
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:06,960
Help!

1287
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:19,930
Please!

1288
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:25,270
Oh my gosh.

1289
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:27,050
Please.

1290
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:28,050
Ah!

1291
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:31,030
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1292
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:35,290
I miss having my guys.

1293
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:39,850
I miss having them.

1294
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:42,970
I miss having the guys.

1295
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:52,010
Wait, there's more here too.

1296
01:33:56,670 --> 01:33:58,610
Stop shooting down my stuff!

1297
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:18,830
That was a close one, honestly.

1298
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:21,050
Too close.

1299
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:26,650
Am I supposed to get these out of the way now?

1300
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:32,800
Get out of my way.

1301
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:36,240
Soup.

1302
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:40,920
Out of my way.

1303
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,220
You gotta juke his shot.

1304
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:46,740
Yeah, I was in a bit of a panic.

1305
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:51,760
I hope there's nobody down there.

1306
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:53,180
I'm just littering.

1307
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:53,760
That's fine.

1308
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:00,120
We're putting car batteries in the...

1309
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,160
In the ocean.

1310
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,820
Yeah, car batteries in the ocean!

1311
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,320
I was trying.

1312
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:36,700
to get this thing like the big van to move but clearly i'm trying to see now if there's any more health underneath doesn't seem like it okay car battery is in the ocean nothing else okay

1313
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:55,310
oh come wait there's got to be stuff in here oh Yeah, baby.

1314
01:35:56,850 --> 01:35:57,870
That works.

1315
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:02,970
Uh, let me in.

1316
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:06,550
Let me in.

1317
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:07,230
There we go.

1318
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:09,550
Oh, I didn't realize it was health.

1319
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:11,410
Yay!

1320
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:18,090
The leeches are all that's left in the ocean.

1321
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:19,410
Don't say that.

1322
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:21,030
Oh, wow.

1323
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:22,550
My blood.

1324
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:23,950
I've marked this place.

1325
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:30,490
Minto got into the strange van.

1326
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:32,610
It's mine.

1327
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:34,430
That's my van.

1328
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:43,990
Oh boy!

1329
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:52,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1330
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:53,460
Thing!

1331
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:58,710
What the hell is that?

1332
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:01,370
Oh gosh.

1333
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:02,850
Okay.

1334
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:03,750
Oh, okay.

1335
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:05,530
Oh!

1336
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:07,850
Uh...

1337
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:10,070
I don't know what these are.

1338
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:11,910
Are you hearing something?

1339
01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:12,230
Huh?

1340
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:15,350
Ah!

1341
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,280
Ouch!

1342
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:29,020
Oh!

1343
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:35,460
Ouch!

1344
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:36,800
Out of my way!

1345
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,760
Brute forcing it a little bit.

1346
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:43,860
Ouch, ouch!

1347
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,360
Oh my gosh, these things sucks.

1348
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:47,600
I've learned my lesson.

1349
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,060
Oh no!

1350
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,240
No, please!

1351
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:58,780
No!

1352
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:04,020
Mufasa, please!

1353
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,020
Mufasa!

1354
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:11,760
No, no, no, no.

1355
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:15,060
Don't come towards me!

1356
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,280
And a little butt tag.

1357
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:30,530
Oh my god, he's hanging on my friend.

1358
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:32,290
He doesn't want to let go!

1359
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:37,010
Final fracture detected.

1360
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:39,530
Oh, we got it.

1361
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:40,210
I think?

1362
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,150
I need to like...

1363
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:49,330
Um...

1364
01:38:49,330 --> 01:38:50,470
Things could be better.

1365
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:55,790
Things could be way better right now.

1366
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:59,670
Gordon's silly road trip.

1367
01:39:00,430 --> 01:39:00,750
Yeah.

1368
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:03,660
Oh...

1369
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:05,700
Oh...

1370
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:06,510
Okay.

1371
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:09,310
Yes!

1372
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,690
But there's all this right here.

1373
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:21,160
Where'd that thing go?

1374
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:33,950
Nobody does it like you, boss.

1375
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:36,310
Wait,

1376
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:47,360
is it too big for me to pick up?

1377
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,540
Maybe I can roll over it.

1378
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,760
Have a look next to the rock on the hill?

1379
01:39:57,780 --> 01:39:58,240
Oh!

1380
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:05,660
Oh, I didn't mean to use it.

1381
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,120
Shoot.

1382
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:07,680
I thought I pressed...

1383
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,220
I thought I pressed one.

1384
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,420
Oh, there's a guy.

1385
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,080
Oh, he's running.

1386
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:32,660
I think I can get him.

1387
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:38,290
Dang.

1388
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:40,350
Oh, he still caught him.

1389
01:40:41,170 --> 01:40:41,990
That's insane.

1390
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:46,030
Uh, Lydia!

1391
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:48,070
Thank you so much for the...

1392
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,570
Redirect!

1393
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:49,190
Thank you!

1394
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:50,670
Thank you, thank you!

1395
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:54,830
I like sniping.

1396
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:04,700
Lead your shots as if I didn't just give both guys.

1397
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:12,070
Good.

1398
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:13,890
Root force wins again.

1399
01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:15,390
What is that, though?

1400
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:20,720
What is that?

1401
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:23,040
Is that like a force field?

1402
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,200
It's a gate.

1403
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:36,300
Hold on, I'm gonna go close.

1404
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:39,020
Can I go through?

1405
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:41,520
Oh.

1406
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:42,460
Are there any other guys?

1407
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:42,920
Wait!

1408
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:43,740
God.

1409
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:48,660
Whoa!

1410
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:50,580
I pinned him to the wall!

1411
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:52,760
Pin a soldier to the boomboard.

1412
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:55,520
I got an achievement for it.

1413
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:56,840
That's crazy.

1414
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:57,920
Oh, okay.

1415
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,280
So I can go through, but I don't think my car can probably go through.

1416
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:05,500
So what we're going to do is we're going to get it nice and close.

1417
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:16,300
We're going to get it nice and close just in case we start getting, you know, bush or something.

1418
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:17,800
I don't know what's gonna happen here.

1419
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:19,340
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1420
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:25,750
Nice and close.

1421
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:27,750
Hokey-dokey.

1422
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:37,300
Yeah, I guess that was, yeah, it's like a crossbow that's...

1423
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:42,090
I heard somebody.

1424
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:47,310
I walked over that and I heard that, but I definitely heard like a radio sound.

1425
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:48,630
I think.

1426
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:51,170
I guess I did.

1427
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:55,550
You bastard.

1428
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:06,780
I don't want to waste all of it though.

1429
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:15,940
Holy moly.

1430
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:26,060
Okay.

1431
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:28,900
What is...

1432
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:31,440
Oh my gosh, I was just about to say what is that?

1433
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,100
No!

1434
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,840
Oh my god, they are...

1435
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:41,620
are evil.

1436
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:42,880
The balls.

1437
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:44,580
But they can be destroyed.

1438
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:45,800
Oh!

1439
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:50,140
They can be destroyed, right?

1440
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:51,140
Pick them up.

1441
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:51,760
Can I?

1442
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:54,380
Soup.

1443
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:01,380
Only by water.

1444
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,320
Like that.

1445
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:14,340
I like how they're charging their car.

1446
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:20,930
Nice.

1447
01:44:28,690 --> 01:44:29,690
Why am I picking up yet?

1448
01:44:30,090 --> 01:44:30,190
Oh.

1449
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:33,210
What's this?

1450
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:34,290
Thank you.

1451
01:44:35,370 --> 01:44:35,930
And health.

1452
01:44:37,330 --> 01:44:38,010
Somewhere?

1453
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:44,510
There was...

1454
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:45,490
There were two balls.

1455
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:48,110
Where could the other one be?

1456
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:52,990
Another ball.

1457
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:57,370
Other ball.

1458
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:04,630
The way they growl.

1459
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,140
Okay.

1460
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:23,040
Very good.

1461
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:27,000
Nothing in the truck?

1462
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:27,920
Lamb.

1463
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:38,580
Explosives.

1464
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:39,600
Danger.

1465
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:42,260
Okay.

1466
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:48,970
I see that...

1467
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:52,610
Oh, I thought I saw something behind there.

1468
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:53,090
Oh!

1469
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:53,850
Lucky.

1470
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:55,950
Um...

1471
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:59,710
I see that the gate is powered by the car, by the way.

1472
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:00,750
I'm just looking around.

1473
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:05,430
Do I, like, blow it up?

1474
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:23,540
More?

1475
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:23,960
More?

1476
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:32,520
I saw you.

1477
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:34,260
Steal their Wi-Fi.

1478
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,360
I'm hacking their databases.

1479
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:46,720
That

1480
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:57,190
felt good.

1481
01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:01,750
That felt good.

1482
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:09,610
Forgot the parking break.

1483
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:10,630
Rookie mistake.

1484
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:15,340
All right.

1485
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:17,900
That wasn't so bad.

1486
01:47:19,620 --> 01:47:21,040
Okay, crossbows under four.

1487
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:23,280
Oh!

1488
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:23,940
Sorry.

1489
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,640
What about how much ammo do I have?

1490
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:28,860
Oh, not so much.

1491
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:33,580
It will be used in dire situations.

1492
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:48,080
Okay, through the tunnel of loading the next scene.

1493
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,200
Oh gosh.

1494
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:57,220
Oh, uh, I can't see.

1495
01:47:58,820 --> 01:47:59,120
I...

1496
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:00,800
Oh, no, no, no.

1497
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:20,770
Uh, thought that there might be things in here, but no.

1498
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:25,940
Like, uh, carrots.

1499
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:27,480
No carrots.

1500
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,060
So quiet all of a sudden.

1501
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:36,180
Oh, hello?

1502
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,380
I have three.

1503
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,740
How many does it take to take him down?

1504
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,960
I mean, definitely I will need more, though.

1505
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:04,260
This place looks pretty...

1506
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:06,380
Like, it's probably pretty secure.

1507
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:08,700
With lots of men.

1508
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:11,020
Huh?

1509
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,360
Huh?

1510
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:13,880
What if...

1511
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:16,700
I got the 24-carat gold Laboobu.

1512
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:18,400
Would you say it for me?

1513
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:26,980
I am the owner of the world's only 24-carat gold Laboobu.

1514
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:32,100
Ah,

1515
01:49:35,540 --> 01:49:37,100
Dregos, thank you so much for the...

1516
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,740
For the 20 gift and thank you!

1517
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,200
Wait, what's in here?

1518
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:42,340
Oh.

1519
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:43,460
Just...

1520
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:44,440
I thought it was carrots.

1521
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:46,900
This place is quiet!

1522
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,040
This place is too quiet.

1523
01:49:57,950 --> 01:49:58,670
It's quiet.

1524
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:02,290
Too quiet.

1525
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:07,400
Oh, I hear.

1526
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:09,300
Where are you?

1527
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:16,610
Oh, shoot!

1528
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:26,860
No other ones, right?

1529
01:50:31,410 --> 01:50:32,190
Nice.

1530
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,410
Um, I'm going to...

1531
01:50:35,410 --> 01:50:36,790
What's up, Doc?

1532
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:41,130
I'll remember that these are here for future.

1533
01:50:42,730 --> 01:50:43,910
I'm exploring now.

1534
01:50:45,290 --> 01:50:46,830
Well, um...

1535
01:50:46,830 --> 01:50:49,870
But good thing we caught that before we were in mid-battle, no?

1536
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:53,650
Okay, so we gotta disable this.

1537
01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:56,210
Actually, how do I...

1538
01:50:56,210 --> 01:50:57,990
Oh, I guess I just drive up here, huh?

1539
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:01,790
We must disable.

1540
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:03,990
Where?

1541
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:20,800
just run up on them oh but you can shoot through these windows

1542
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:51,380
yeah they just detonate rockets exactly make sense to me oh i thought somebody was behind

1543
01:51:56,470 --> 01:52:03,630
imagine the guy was it's the chair the cook chair someone to some guy just chilling in there

1544
01:52:07,310 --> 01:52:07,810
Okay.

1545
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:15,330
What were they doing in here, huh?

1546
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:17,290
You have to wonder.

1547
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:22,650
I mean, you don't have to, but I do wonder.

1548
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,280
I'm safe scumming, I'm safe scumming.

1549
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:31,160
Oh, my golly goodness!

1550
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:34,260
That's why I'm safe scumming.

1551
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:36,600
Come here.

1552
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,440
You come to me.

1553
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:43,400
Yeah.

1554
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:45,960
Wait, did I...

1555
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:46,600
Did someone...

1556
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:46,740
No?

1557
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:48,140
No?

1558
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:52,160
Nothing?

1559
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:53,720
What is this?

1560
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:54,300
Oh.

1561
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:58,240
Oh, my nose won't stop being so itchy.

1562
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:00,700
Um, me too.

1563
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,800
Um, what nose?

1564
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,000
Um, me too?

1565
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:08,360
Um, what news?

1566
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:11,580
Nose?

1567
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:15,160
This stupid VTuber thinks she has a nose.

1568
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:24,300
Oh, screw that.

1569
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:26,260
Come here.

1570
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:29,440
No, no, no!

1571
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:35,680
Oh shit!

1572
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,140
Yeah, just fall off the edge.

1573
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:43,120
Jump!

1574
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:44,300
Yeah, like that!

1575
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:44,940
Do that!

1576
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:54,540
Oh my gosh, wait, they don't fall?

1577
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:55,880
Wait, there's more?

1578
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:56,220
Wait.

1579
01:53:56,380 --> 01:53:57,780
Oh, they can jump back up?

1580
01:53:58,640 --> 01:53:58,740
Oh!

1581
01:53:59,880 --> 01:53:59,900
Ah!

1582
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:01,980
Oh!

1583
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:08,680
Oh!

1584
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:12,540
Wait.

1585
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:15,280
I thought I heard a crawly sound.

1586
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:16,340
Oh!

1587
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:21,580
I hear a...

1588
01:54:21,580 --> 01:54:22,800
I don't think it was him, though.

1589
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:25,100
The crawly sound that I heard.

1590
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,080
Came from my left.

1591
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:28,940
I know.

1592
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,640
These guys are so stressful, no?

1593
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:32,600
Oh, there's a door over there.

1594
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:35,000
All right, there's so much around here, huh?

1595
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:40,360
So even blowing...

1596
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,360
Blowing them here did nothing.

1597
01:54:52,650 --> 01:54:54,930
Oh, I think I'm hearing, like, rocks crumbling.

1598
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:56,650
Oh, okay, okay.

1599
01:55:02,050 --> 01:55:03,510
And stay down!

1600
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:10,590
Oh.

1601
01:55:11,610 --> 01:55:12,390
Got a little.

1602
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:18,340
All right.

1603
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:20,940
One more building.

1604
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:24,440
I think I got a little ahead of myself coming down here first.

1605
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:27,400
I think we need to go over there to disable stuff.

1606
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:29,480
But there was one other building.

1607
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:31,640
I think where those guys came from.

1608
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:33,000
This one right here.

1609
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:36,040
But I want to check out real quick first.

1610
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:41,320
Oh, it just leads me...

1611
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:41,520
Oh.

1612
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:44,960
Well, that works actually perfectly.

1613
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:50,650
And then...

1614
01:55:50,650 --> 01:55:50,890
Ah!

1615
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:52,550
Oh.

1616
01:55:52,930 --> 01:55:54,110
That's awesome.

1617
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:56,770
Oh my gosh, wait though.

1618
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,710
If you don't...

1619
01:55:57,710 --> 01:55:59,070
Oh, okay.

1620
01:55:59,550 --> 01:56:01,310
Also, this.

1621
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:03,650
That, that, that.

1622
01:56:05,350 --> 01:56:07,110
But if you don't know that...

1623
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:12,270
That, uh...

1624
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:15,010
There's...

1625
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:15,690
What's it called?

1626
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:20,900
What was I saying?

1627
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:26,160
Oh, if you don't know that there was that guy down there, you would just drop right on top of him.

1628
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:27,100
That would be so evil.

1629
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:47,860
that's what i was saying sorry my i got a little panicky because i came in here i was like where am i what's happening how do i get up there um what can i grab oh maybe you oops wrong button

1630
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:40,130
i knew it was too quiet in here i knew it i knew it i knew it these guys are sick Oh, you can still see the old man's ear.

1631
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:41,950
These guys are sick.

1632
01:57:42,650 --> 01:57:43,870
Sick and twisted.

1633
01:57:49,170 --> 01:57:50,290
Absolutely twisted.

1634
01:57:50,990 --> 01:57:51,390
Nice job.

1635
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:52,010
Thank you.

1636
01:57:52,510 --> 01:57:54,170
I will save after that for sure.

1637
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:54,630
For sure.

1638
01:57:58,950 --> 01:57:59,510
Okay.

1639
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:03,210
There's a lot of ammo and stuff out here.

1640
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:07,030
So I guess we go in there.

1641
01:58:07,210 --> 01:58:13,510
And I imagine when we come back to the spot is when we have to fight that thing again.

1642
01:58:14,810 --> 01:58:16,170
Hatsune Miku.

1643
01:58:18,830 --> 01:58:20,150
Paggy, Minto Paggy.

1644
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:21,950
Paggy, Paggy.

1645
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:41,820
Oh.

1646
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,700
Don't like that.

1647
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:48,700
Why would they be giving me so much supplies?

1648
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,740
Don't like that.

1649
01:58:58,450 --> 01:59:01,090
Okay, we'll be fighting him sooner than I imagined.

1650
01:59:01,490 --> 01:59:02,970
Okay, got it.

1651
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:04,470
Oh.

1652
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:16,520
Epic foreshadowing.

1653
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:18,500
Yes.

1654
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:24,230
Just in case there's regular men here.

1655
01:59:25,390 --> 01:59:26,490
Say first, I already did.

1656
01:59:27,510 --> 01:59:28,710
I'll save right here, actually.

1657
01:59:28,790 --> 01:59:29,590
This might be a better spot.

1658
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:40,480
Okay.

1659
01:59:41,660 --> 01:59:42,900
Oh, come on.

1660
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:46,680
Okay.

1661
01:59:52,510 --> 02:00:06,430
get that guy out of the way I don't want to be thinking about him at all okay I see that ladder but I'm gonna go up first does that mean flammable

1662
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:13,290
how did I notice I'm just good like that

1663
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:18,290
gosh there's so much

1664
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:29,020
so much supplies so so much supplies This is like big boss time.

1665
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:34,940
Yeah, my glass is on.

1666
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:43,680
It'd be funny if we could still see that little poison head crab downstairs.

1667
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,560
Okay, let's go back down.

1668
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:56,200
Big boss, like Metal Gear Solid.

1669
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:57,800
Exactly, exactly.

1670
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,120
Exactly.

1671
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,620
Don't tell me to jump yet.

1672
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:13,660
I'm exploring.

1673
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,700
Jeez, Louise.

1674
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,100
Can I...

1675
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:22,560
Oh, wait.

1676
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:23,440
Maybe from here?

1677
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:25,080
Oh, my gosh.

1678
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:26,200
Trapped on something.

1679
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:27,520
I think.

1680
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:32,840
Dual flip.

1681
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,260
Maybe this side would be better.

1682
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:41,380
Okay.

1683
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:42,360
Nice.

1684
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:45,620
We took out this.

1685
02:01:45,640 --> 02:02:19,000
this guy so we don't have to worry about him okay nice okay nice who's that that was dirty that was so dirty uh-oh uh-oh um there's a whole lot of shaking.

1686
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:24,360
What's shaking, Bacon?

1687
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:31,520
I didn't need to use that.

1688
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:34,960
What is it?

1689
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:39,860
Why is it shaking so much?

1690
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:42,400
Uh-oh.

1691
02:02:42,620 --> 02:02:43,300
What's down there?

1692
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,820
Oh, there's a train going on top of me.

1693
02:02:52,620 --> 02:02:53,680
Oh, cute.

1694
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:55,960
So atmospheric.

1695
02:02:57,180 --> 02:02:58,260
Love this series.

1696
02:03:05,150 --> 02:03:05,550
Okay.

1697
02:03:06,570 --> 02:03:07,190
Is that a sniper?

1698
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:15,360
They also, like, give you stuff if you drop.

1699
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:16,760
This is so interesting.

1700
02:03:17,860 --> 02:03:24,340
I'm not sure what's going on at all.

1701
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:28,860
Oh, that was so good.

1702
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:32,640
If you drop, is a matter of when.

1703
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:36,740
Okay.

1704
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:39,000
Explosives down there.

1705
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:41,060
Oh!

1706
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:41,840
Whoa, whoa.

1707
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:43,820
And another head crab.

1708
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:44,680
Yep.

1709
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:47,640
Oh no, it's a crossbow.

1710
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:49,480
What is happening?

1711
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:51,380
Why are they loading me up?

1712
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:52,700
Ow!

1713
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,720
Time for the crossbow.

1714
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:01,840
If I could get out the door.

1715
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:14,190
I thought I saw a guy go in there, but...

1716
02:04:18,510 --> 02:04:20,050
Allergic to rocket usage.

1717
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:21,170
I got only three!

1718
02:04:21,930 --> 02:04:23,910
And I know I have a big guy coming up!

1719
02:04:25,690 --> 02:04:27,170
Maybe I should have used the rocket, so huh?

1720
02:04:27,270 --> 02:04:27,490
Wait.

1721
02:04:30,430 --> 02:04:31,250
We're fine!

1722
02:04:33,310 --> 02:04:33,770
Wait.

1723
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:36,590
Yeah, we're so fine.

1724
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:40,510
Eww!

1725
02:04:43,470 --> 02:04:45,190
You can't reload this.

1726
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:47,970
But I could reload everything else.

1727
02:04:48,610 --> 02:04:49,010
Let's see.

1728
02:04:49,730 --> 02:04:50,450
That's loaded.

1729
02:04:51,110 --> 02:04:52,350
Locked and loaded, baby.

1730
02:04:53,890 --> 02:04:55,410
Locked and loaded, baby.

1731
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:56,810
Locked and loaded, baby.

1732
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:57,890
What's actually?

1733
02:04:57,890 --> 02:04:58,570
45, okay.

1734
02:04:58,670 --> 02:04:59,770
Locked and loaded, baby.

1735
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:01,630
Locked and loaded, baby.

1736
02:05:01,790 --> 02:05:02,570
Everything is locked and loaded!

1737
02:05:03,230 --> 02:05:04,590
Well, it was.

1738
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:08,910
Uh, okay.

1739
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:14,960
Onwards.

1740
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:18,760
But where do I go?

1741
02:05:29,690 --> 02:05:29,870
Oh!

1742
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:32,790
This area is so cool.

1743
02:05:34,090 --> 02:05:35,630
I'm paranoid as heck though.

1744
02:05:35,950 --> 02:05:36,450
I'm not gonna...

1745
02:05:39,770 --> 02:05:40,290
You!

1746
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:43,810
I'm not gonna lie, I'm so paranoid in here.

1747
02:05:43,890 --> 02:05:44,930
I don't like it at all.

1748
02:05:45,390 --> 02:05:46,890
My ocean has no trigger discipline.

1749
02:05:47,170 --> 02:05:47,890
What do you mean?

1750
02:05:52,190 --> 02:05:53,070
Rip ammo.

1751
02:05:53,690 --> 02:05:54,350
What do you mean?

1752
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:55,730
I was full.

1753
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:56,950
I couldn't take anymore.

1754
02:05:57,850 --> 02:05:59,230
Oh, the one that I accidentally shot?

1755
02:05:59,390 --> 02:06:00,230
Yeah, rip that ammo.

1756
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:06,010
I think coming back is going to be hell, isn't it?

1757
02:06:07,570 --> 02:06:13,150
On the way here is nice and easy breezy, but on the way back is going to be hellscape, isn't it?

1758
02:06:13,250 --> 02:06:16,170
Is that what I'm deducing correctly?

1759
02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:17,970
Oh my goodness.

1760
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:23,860
She's fine.

1761
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:25,320
Am I?

1762
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:26,420
I'm scared.

1763
02:06:27,820 --> 02:06:29,180
I don't feel fine.

1764
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:31,500
Am I fine or am I fine?

1765
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:32,500
She's fine.

1766
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:36,080
Are we gaming?

1767
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:37,200
Speed running?

1768
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:39,180
Oh,

1769
02:06:53,570 --> 02:06:54,190
I hear somebody.

1770
02:06:56,490 --> 02:06:57,630
I hear some chatter.

1771
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:07,140
Is that...

1772
02:07:07,140 --> 02:07:08,960
No, that's not where I came from, is it?

1773
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:21,290
No way, did I take the longest way?

1774
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:28,380
Oh my god, I see the head crab.

1775
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:33,660
Oopsie!

1776
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:35,700
Well, um, now we know.

1777
02:07:45,260 --> 02:07:47,820
We learn, we adapt, exactly.

1778
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:49,860
I heard men.

1779
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:00,540
What the heck was that?

1780
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:08,280
That took longer than I wanted it to?

1781
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:15,040
I guess I could have just run in and blasted.

1782
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:19,580
Hello?

1783
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:20,900
Woo!

1784
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:25,060
Woo!

1785
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:26,840
You take hits!

1786
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:27,900
Oh my goodness!

1787
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:31,500
Oh!

1788
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,020
You bastard!

1789
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:42,960
I just used that health that I didn't mean to.

1790
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,380
Oh, there's another one.

1791
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:47,080
We're okay.

1792
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:56,300
I do like that they eventually come to me.

1793
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,540
Oh, sorry.

1794
02:09:03,820 --> 02:09:04,760
Why do you have red eyes?

1795
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:10,460
Okay, we're fine.

1796
02:09:10,860 --> 02:09:11,200
Maybe.

1797
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:16,140
Shotgunner.

1798
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:18,260
Just like me.

1799
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:21,560
We are twinning.

1800
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:23,320
We are one and the same, baby.

1801
02:09:27,180 --> 02:09:28,500
I guess it would have been good.

1802
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,020
I throw a grenade up here.

1803
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:31,140
Everything explodes.

1804
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:35,600
Would have been sick.

1805
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:37,820
Would have been noise.

1806
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:40,280
What did I just hit?

1807
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:41,580
Oh, my nail.

1808
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:45,720
Wait a second.

1809
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:47,380
I got this guy.

1810
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:49,600
If I can get out the door.

1811
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:52,820
Is he up here?

1812
02:09:53,420 --> 02:09:53,760
Oh, wait.

1813
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:54,700
I don't have...

1814
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:54,780
Oh.

1815
02:10:03,510 --> 02:10:04,390
Elite sniper.

1816
02:10:04,550 --> 02:10:05,610
A sniper elite time?

1817
02:10:06,030 --> 02:10:06,770
Yes, absolutely.

1818
02:10:15,120 --> 02:10:15,560
Alright.

1819
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:17,280
Let's go back to the shotgun.

1820
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:22,940
Woo!

1821
02:10:29,650 --> 02:10:30,090
And...

1822
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:33,190
I know there were three of you.

1823
02:10:37,590 --> 02:10:37,950
Just kidding.

1824
02:10:38,950 --> 02:10:39,710
I can't count.

1825
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:45,700
They're so stupid.

1826
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:47,680
Wait, um...

1827
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:49,480
So then I gravity gun, right?

1828
02:10:53,460 --> 02:10:54,240
Uh-oh.

1829
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:56,500
I don't like that.

1830
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:58,820
I don't like that they're giving me everything.

1831
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:03,780
It's a...

1832
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:07,260
Did I complete it correctly?

1833
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:12,520
Okay.

1834
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,540
Are we puzzling?

1835
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:24,600
Uh-oh.

1836
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:25,480
I hear him.

1837
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,000
Time to go.

1838
02:11:30,240 --> 02:11:30,780
Time to go.

1839
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:35,640
Can I get him from here?

1840
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:39,420
But I have nothing in here.

1841
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,100
Oh gosh, okay.

1842
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:44,360
I like how the...

1843
02:11:52,580 --> 02:11:54,960
This time I can actually shoot through the windows, right?

1844
02:12:01,620 --> 02:12:02,820
Who's shooting at me?

1845
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:03,200
Oh, wait.

1846
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:03,780
Is it him?

1847
02:12:04,420 --> 02:12:06,440
It felt like something else was also shooting at me.

1848
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:10,260
Just don't hit the window.

1849
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:18,530
Holy moly.

1850
02:12:20,110 --> 02:12:22,070
Oh, like there's actual guys shooting at me.

1851
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:22,530
Yeah.

1852
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:28,400
Holy cow.

1853
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:31,620
Don't hit the window that detonates rockets.

1854
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:34,720
I wish I could kill these guys, too.

1855
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:37,340
These stinking guys.

1856
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:40,520
Right?

1857
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:41,580
Where are they?

1858
02:12:43,860 --> 02:12:45,740
Actually, I have no idea where they're coming from.

1859
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:49,840
I have no ammo, yeah.

1860
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:54,660
Time for me to go.

1861
02:12:55,320 --> 02:12:56,980
Wait, actually, let me read.

1862
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:02,720
Below?

1863
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:03,540
Under the bridge?

1864
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:10,240
Oh,

1865
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:15,890
I hear them.

1866
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:30,400
Okay.

1867
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:31,920
Oh!

1868
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:34,240
I can also do that.

1869
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:40,870
Did I get him?

1870
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,890
I don't know.

1871
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:49,750
Holy cow!

1872
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:01,030
Okay.

1873
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:03,230
We're going back down.

1874
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:05,410
Under the bridge?

1875
02:14:07,650 --> 02:14:10,250
Oh yeah, I was about to be like, Oh, I can start shooting at him again.

1876
02:14:10,550 --> 02:14:12,750
Okay, okay.

1877
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:31,310
Wait, can I go under the bridge?

1878
02:14:37,730 --> 02:14:38,130
Oh!

1879
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:42,090
I'm... I didn't actually mean to grab that.

1880
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:43,010
Okay, hold on.

1881
02:14:44,030 --> 02:14:44,190
Alright.

1882
02:14:46,110 --> 02:14:47,030
The head crab.

1883
02:14:47,550 --> 02:14:48,490
The head crab area.

1884
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:50,450
That's where there was the unlimited ammo.

1885
02:14:51,810 --> 02:14:52,350
Okay, okay, okay.

1886
02:14:53,290 --> 02:14:53,730
We're running.

1887
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:56,570
Oh, if I could.

1888
02:15:00,370 --> 02:15:00,610
Here.

1889
02:15:00,970 --> 02:15:01,130
Okay.

1890
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:01,690
Alright.

1891
02:15:03,050 --> 02:15:04,730
No, it's the other side.

1892
02:15:05,110 --> 02:15:05,450
Ow!

1893
02:15:05,730 --> 02:15:06,630
It's over there!

1894
02:15:09,470 --> 02:15:10,350
Okay, okay, okay.

1895
02:15:15,310 --> 02:15:19,110
We gave in, we gave in, we gave in, we gave in, we gave in, we gave in, holy cow!

1896
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:48,160
Maybe I'm being greedy.

1897
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:50,080
I'm probably being greedy.

1898
02:16:14,620 --> 02:16:14,620
Ow!

1899
02:16:15,140 --> 02:16:15,140
Gosh!

1900
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:17,580
This just sucks.

1901
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:19,200
It's okay, I saved in here, so...

1902
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:21,100
If I die, I die.

1903
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:21,660
I don't care.

1904
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:40,420
Were there...

1905
02:16:40,420 --> 02:16:41,360
Did I

1906
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,560
ask him if they were...

1907
02:16:55,490 --> 02:16:56,750
Round two, anybody?

1908
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:10,600
I might be the dumbest ghost ever alive.

1909
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:14,220
I'm not alive, but I might be stupid!

1910
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:22,880
I saved?

1911
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:24,160
I saved?

1912
02:17:24,660 --> 02:17:25,440
I'll save again?

1913
02:17:25,580 --> 02:17:26,220
I saved?

1914
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:27,560
I saved!

1915
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:41,270
I can't even be mad about it.

1916
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:42,870
You can't even be mad.

1917
02:17:43,450 --> 02:17:45,450
Okay, so now we just make our way...

1918
02:17:45,450 --> 02:17:46,330
Can I just jump?

1919
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:47,710
And like, swim?

1920
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:52,210
Let me try jumping.

1921
02:17:54,150 --> 02:17:54,670
Do I flip?

1922
02:17:58,530 --> 02:18:00,370
This is not Minecraft.

1923
02:18:00,890 --> 02:18:00,890
Okay.

1924
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:03,550
Got it?

1925
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:04,610
I understand now.

1926
02:18:07,610 --> 02:18:10,650
I don't think there was anything else I needed, so...

1927
02:18:10,650 --> 02:18:11,890
Oops, I missed.

1928
02:18:14,210 --> 02:18:14,510
Okay.

1929
02:18:15,790 --> 02:18:17,310
Doesn't mean you'll survive.

1930
02:18:18,210 --> 02:18:22,310
But Minecraft taught me if I fall into water, I'll be good.

1931
02:18:24,770 --> 02:18:25,330
Okay.

1932
02:18:27,950 --> 02:18:56,380
difficult than going down what if I jump now what if I jumped right now instead why is there why did they load me up with so much supplies when I really didn't need it do it okay wait let me save okay now I'll I'll live I'll live I'll

1933
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:03,360
So some really good jumps over to the box.

1934
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:06,140
Not that last few though.

1935
02:19:12,610 --> 02:19:12,810
Ouch.

1936
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:13,830
It's okay.

1937
02:19:14,130 --> 02:19:14,670
My ankles.

1938
02:19:15,750 --> 02:19:16,430
Me ankles.

1939
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:28,740
Nice.

1940
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:35,700
Again, I think I got everything.

1941
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:36,980
And around here.

1942
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:45,100
Marlarg That was everything I needed to do, right?

1943
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:46,140
I turned off the bridge.

1944
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:47,340
I turned off the staff.

1945
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:50,880
I'm not gonna get ambushed in here, am I?

1946
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:51,740
Oh, oh gosh.

1947
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:52,640
Okay, never mind.

1948
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:53,080
We are.

1949
02:20:00,940 --> 02:20:02,200
Who will win?

1950
02:20:02,420 --> 02:20:04,140
Epic rap battles.

1951
02:20:06,020 --> 02:20:06,820
Crab head.

1952
02:20:07,480 --> 02:20:08,180
Head crab.

1953
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:09,520
Or...

1954
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:09,860
Oh, wait.

1955
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:10,600
That means the sand.

1956
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:11,420
That means the...

1957
02:20:11,860 --> 02:20:12,660
What are they called?

1958
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:15,240
The sand lion- the ant lions are here.

1959
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:15,860
Oh no.

1960
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:19,760
That's no good.

1961
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:22,060
Oh that's no good.

1962
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:23,880
Oh that's no good.

1963
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:26,860
Oh that's no good.

1964
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:27,860
Oh that's no good.

1965
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:29,240
Oh that's no good.

1966
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:30,440
Oh that's no good.

1967
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:30,960
Oh that's no good.

1968
02:20:31,260 --> 02:20:31,380
Oh that's no good.

1969
02:20:31,380 --> 02:20:32,700
Okay uh, we're running.

1970
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:39,250
I- for some reason I want to crawl- call them- oh!

1971
02:20:40,390 --> 02:20:40,510
Oh!

1972
02:20:41,590 --> 02:20:41,830
Oh!

1973
02:21:02,310 --> 02:21:03,030
Anybody else?

1974
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:09,040
Oh!

1975
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:14,270
Nice HP.

1976
02:21:15,210 --> 02:21:15,710
Always.

1977
02:21:20,200 --> 02:21:21,480
Oh my god.

1978
02:21:21,820 --> 02:21:22,320
Oh my god.

1979
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:23,180
Oh my god.

1980
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:28,620
Was there like some thumper I didn't know about?

1981
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:30,620
Wait, but that gate is still on.

1982
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:32,660
Uh-oh.

1983
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:33,220
Wait.

1984
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:34,880
Maybe I go that way instead.

1985
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:35,300
Okay.

1986
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:36,280
Right.

1987
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:37,320
Has to be.

1988
02:21:37,980 --> 02:21:38,360
Yeah.

1989
02:21:38,780 --> 02:21:39,180
Yeah.

1990
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:41,600
Yeah.

1991
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:42,300
Yeah.

1992
02:21:43,060 --> 02:21:51,860
Um, I feel like, hold on, one moment, please, there was health that I didn't need before that I can grab now.

1993
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,680
I just don't remember where it all was.

1994
02:21:55,520 --> 02:22:00,370
Okay, not any...

1995
02:22:00,370 --> 02:22:02,170
Yeah, we'll drive across the bridge.

1996
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:06,170
Of course, and we didn't totally hear all that rumbling before.

1997
02:22:08,890 --> 02:22:14,330
That would make it... You think anything is bad in there either, you know?

1998
02:22:16,530 --> 02:22:18,750
By the entrance and here?

1999
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:21,490
Oh, there's one.

2000
02:22:21,710 --> 02:22:22,210
Okay, nice.

2001
02:22:22,690 --> 02:22:22,950
Okay.

2002
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:24,710
There's some.

2003
02:22:24,950 --> 02:22:26,470
We can just top it off.

2004
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:32,830
I lost all the little ammo for my suit that I had.

2005
02:22:36,610 --> 02:22:38,650
I- Oops.

2006
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:42,510
Gosh, Gordon Freeman, you're fat ass.

2007
02:22:43,430 --> 02:22:44,430
You guys!

2008
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:45,510

02:24:29,810 --> 02:24:31,430
Denim doesn't shrink.

2012
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:35,510
I'm so sad.

2013
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:40,350
I wanted to wear it so bad.

2014
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:42,210
Oh.

2015
02:24:44,410 --> 02:24:45,130
Man.

02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:50,350
Denim hella shrinks.

2017
02:24:50,550 --> 02:24:50,970
It does.

2018
02:24:52,490 --> 02:24:53,710
It shrinks in the wash.

2019
02:24:54,210 --> 02:24:54,670

2020
02:24:55,770 --> 02:24:57,090

2022
02:24:58,530 --> 02:24:58,990
It does?

2023
02:25:00,690 --> 02:25:02,050
Denim shrinks a lot?

2024
02:25:02,230 --> 02:25:02,850
It does?

2025
02:25:03,970 --> 02:25:06,950
But I don't think I ever dried it.

2026
02:25:07,070 --> 02:25:09,610
I think I always hung dried it.

2027
02:25:10,270 --> 02:25:11,890
I think my butt just got bigger.

2028
02:25:14,610 --> 02:25:21,090
I think my... I think my butt got bigger and now I can't wear those skirt.

2029
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:33,990
We're getting the funny hat.

2030
02:25:34,610 --> 02:25:34,990
No!

2031
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:43,720
Okay, I'm over it.

2032
02:25:43,980 --> 02:25:44,200
Anyway.

2033
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:47,560
Let's go.

2034
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:48,580
Over the bridge.

2035
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:49,600
Over the bridge.

2036
02:25:50,820 --> 02:25:51,020
Okay.

2037
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:54,800
I really thought we would be going through there.

2038
02:25:55,380 --> 02:25:57,360
Wait, there was also some supplies.

2039
02:25:58,040 --> 02:25:58,460
One moment.

2040
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:01,160
I remember.

2041
02:26:05,870 --> 02:26:06,650
Slapping your...

2042
02:26:06,650 --> 02:26:07,890
Don't slap my ass!

2043
02:26:10,230 --> 02:26:12,990
Why would you do that?

2044
02:26:15,990 --> 02:26:16,370
No.

2045
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:24,570
I'm so depressed about it.

2046
02:26:24,730 --> 02:26:25,650
I'm not going to lie.

2047
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:29,910
Because the skirt was like, like I said, it was pretty unique.

2048
02:26:30,210 --> 02:26:32,790
The way that like, it's denim, but like, oh.

2049
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:40,980
It was done.

2050
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:45,340
So I don't go that way.

2051
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:52,320

2054
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:22,850
Oh.

2055
02:27:23,430 --> 02:27:23,910
Uh-oh.

2056
02:27:24,110 --> 02:27:25,210
I knew this was gonna happen.

2057
02:27:25,670 --> 02:27:25,830
Wait.

2058
02:27:28,810 --> 02:27:29,570
Goodbye, car!

2059
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:33,640
It was, like, the slowest...

2060
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:33,760
Oh!

2061
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:37,220
What?

2062
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:38,540
I didn't die!

2063
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:41,540
Um...

2064
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:44,620
Oops.

2065
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:48,140
What am I supposed to do here?

2066
02:27:53,690 --> 02:27:54,830
Oh, I see it.

2067
02:27:56,070 --> 02:27:56,670
Oh!

2068
02:28:11,350 --> 02:28:15,170

2074
02:29:23,590 --> 02:29:24,730
I am using Nitro.

2075
02:29:24,990 --> 02:29:25,450
I use it.

2076
02:29:25,570 --> 02:29:25,930
I do.

2077
02:29:26,590 --> 02:29:27,430
That's what you hear.

2078
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:28,430
Like, this?

2079
02:29:29,030 --> 02:29:30,050
This is the Nitro.

2080
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:32,050
Oh, my gosh.

2081
02:29:41,210 --> 02:29:44,850
I'm trying to get this denim skirt on, but I'm dummy thick.

2082
02:29:46,110 --> 02:29:46,870
What was I thinking?

2083
02:29:47,150 --> 02:29:48,630
Getting an extra small.

2084
02:29:55,170 --> 02:29:56,290
Oh, ah.

2085
02:30:01,790 --> 02:30:03,250
Oh my gosh.

2086
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:05,590
This bit is pretty hard, actually.

2087
02:30:06,930 --> 02:30:07,970
At least it's...

2088
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:08,290
Oh, whoops.

2089
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:09,110
I didn't mean to...

2090
02:30:12,310 --> 02:30:12,870
I don't know if

2091
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:16,660
the...

2092
02:30:16,660 --> 02:30:17,160
Swar!

2093
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:27,070
You need to turbo all the way through?

2094
02:30:27,370 --> 02:30:27,790
I do?

2095
02:30:28,010 --> 02:30:29,210
Okay, okay, I'll try.

2096
02:30:34,570 --> 02:30:36,610
But I run out and I can't turbo.

2097
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:37,470
Completely.

2098
02:30:40,830 --> 02:30:41,650
Oh my gosh!

2099
02:30:42,410 --> 02:30:43,550
I made it!

2100
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:44,610
Save?

2101
02:30:45,730 --> 02:30:45,730
Ah!

2102
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:49,290
Yeah!

2103
02:30:49,490 --> 02:30:51,210
Wait, why was I going so slow?

2104
02:30:54,210 --> 02:30:56,530
Why was I going so slow in the end?

2105
02:30:57,210 --> 02:30:57,810
That's funny.

2106
02:30:58,570 --> 02:30:59,470
Can I climb this?

2107
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:00,330
No.

2108
02:31:01,290 --> 02:31:02,170
That'd be neat though.

2109
02:31:04,230 --> 02:31:05,550
First try, baby!

2110
02:31:07,450 --> 02:31:12,670
Every time you are sad about your enormous behind, just imagine Solid Snake telling you you've got a great butt.

2111
02:31:14,910 --> 02:31:16,130
Okay, I'll try.

2112
02:31:16,550 --> 02:31:20,310
But I can't wear cute clothes because my butt is too big.

2113
02:31:23,050 --> 02:31:24,070
Give me one second.

2114
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:35,300
Okay, I was...

2115
02:31:35,300 --> 02:31:40,160
The reason I was turboing too late, or rather later, is because I was trying to...

2116
02:31:40,180 --> 02:31:44,180
Because you can only turbo for a certain amount of time, and then it's got, like, a recharge.

2117
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:45,100
But whatever.

2118
02:31:45,320 --> 02:31:45,880
We got it to work.

2119
02:31:47,500 --> 02:31:49,600
Just got home of my mint merch from Gamersups.

2120
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:51,220
Oh, thank you!

2121
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:53,020
Thanks for ordering it.

2122
02:31:54,040 --> 02:31:54,500
Oh, God.

2123
02:31:55,900 --> 02:31:56,120
Okay.

2124
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:57,660
Save, baby.

2125
02:31:58,380 --> 02:31:58,840
Let's go.

2126
02:32:02,940 --> 02:32:04,220
How do I get up there?

2127
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:08,560
Oh, I don't need to get up there.

2128
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:10,060
Let's go.

2129
02:32:10,300 --> 02:32:10,480
Wait.

2130
02:32:11,020 --> 02:32:11,580
One moment.

2131
02:32:11,740 --> 02:32:14,180
Is there anything down here?

2132
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:15,660
Ouch.

2133
02:32:19,910 --> 02:32:20,350
Nothing.

2134
02:32:23,770 --> 02:32:24,470
My leg.

2135
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:30,160
Uh.

2136
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:34,240
Wait, did I make it?

2137
02:32:34,340 --> 02:32:34,460
Oh.

2138
02:32:36,900 --> 02:32:37,580
Ouch.

2139
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:38,760
Uh.

2140
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:44,200
Sure wish I had a flashlight in here.

2141
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:52,100
Okay.

2142
02:32:54,500 --> 02:32:55,040
Uh.

2143
02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:56,880
Don't like that.

2144
02:32:57,300 --> 02:32:57,460
Wait.

2145
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:58,380
I'm trapped.

2146
02:33:02,750 --> 02:33:03,370
Wait.

2147
02:33:03,610 --> 02:33:04,730
This looks mighty familiar.

2148
02:33:05,370 --> 02:33:09,070
Like, it looks like when you're taking the train in Half-Life 1.

2149
02:33:12,230 --> 02:33:12,990
Why do I have...

2150
02:33:12,990 --> 02:33:13,470
Oh, I don't...

2151
02:33:13,470 --> 02:33:13,790
Wait.

2152
02:33:14,710 --> 02:33:15,550
I'm scared.

2153
02:33:15,770 --> 02:33:18,250
Why do I have my crowbar out?

2154
02:33:18,690 --> 02:33:22,210
I don't like it.

2155
02:33:23,450 --> 02:33:24,830
Oh my gosh.

2156
02:33:29,750 --> 02:33:30,350
Oh, wait.

2157
02:33:30,570 --> 02:33:31,890
No, please, God.

2158
02:33:32,570 --> 02:33:33,210
Brave at home.

2159
02:33:33,850 --> 02:33:35,290
I don't want to go back to the spooky.

2160
02:33:38,050 --> 02:33:38,490
Wait.

2161
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,680
I don't want to go back to the spooky.

2162
02:33:44,300 --> 02:33:45,200
No, no.

2163
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:56,260
But these guys look like they're just sleeping.

2164
02:33:57,140 --> 02:33:57,660
Wait, God.

2165
02:34:04,850 --> 02:34:06,170
He's buggying.

2166
02:34:12,890 --> 02:34:21,450
Oh, I don't like this.

2167
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:23,230
I don't like this at all.

2168
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:29,480
Come here.

2169
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:32,060
Come here, you little cry baby.

2170
02:34:33,480 --> 02:34:34,080
Come here, cry baby.

2171
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:40,320
I awoke the horde!

2172
02:34:40,860 --> 02:34:41,260
Oh gosh.

2173
02:34:42,020 --> 02:34:43,280
Oh, wait, I awoke the horde.

2174
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:44,900
Oh my god, I awoke the horde.

2175
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:47,700
Oh, shoot.

2176
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:49,080
Wait, this is not good.

2177
02:34:49,460 --> 02:34:50,540
Wait, this is really not good.

2178
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:52,020
Oh, God!

2179
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:52,900
Ah!

2180
02:34:53,900 --> 02:34:54,100
Ah!

2181
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:55,700
Wait, my good doesn't work on them!

2182
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:56,660
Oh, God!

2183
02:34:57,100 --> 02:34:57,840
Oh, oh.

2184
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:58,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2185
02:34:59,040 --> 02:34:59,440
I'm trapped.

2186
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:00,800
Oh my god.

2187
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:01,940
Wait, I'm running.

2188
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:02,640
I'm leaving.

2189
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:09,950
Please!

2190
02:35:12,170 --> 02:35:13,410
Stop beating me up!

2191
02:35:33,510 --> 02:35:35,070
Oh, there's so many!

2192
02:35:37,530 --> 02:35:40,170
Oh my god, you bastard!

2193
02:35:41,930 --> 02:35:43,230
Wait, where'd he go?

2194
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:53,470
Is it never ending?

2195
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:55,290
Is it never ending?

2196
02:36:03,380 --> 02:36:06,160
No, they end?

2197
02:36:06,380 --> 02:36:06,620
Okay.

2198
02:36:11,550 --> 02:36:12,790
Oh, okay, that's right.

2199
02:36:14,150 --> 02:36:15,390
There was health in there.

2200
02:36:30,690 --> 02:36:33,150
Maybe this is a mistake, but whatever.

2201
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:42,570
We gotta get, we gotta, we gotta get these cars all...

2202
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:43,950
Whoa.

2203
02:36:46,610 --> 02:36:48,810
Uh, we gotta get them out of the way.

2204
02:36:49,870 --> 02:36:51,970
Luckily the tunnel doesn't seem that big.

2205
02:36:52,570 --> 02:36:53,610
Right, guys!

2206
02:36:57,690 --> 02:36:59,850
$5 to help fund a new skirt.

2207
02:37:00,310 --> 02:37:01,050
Thank you.

2208
02:37:01,870 --> 02:37:04,470
Thanks, I actually went and bought a new one.

2209
02:37:13,390 --> 02:37:15,310
Why are you guys smiling?

2210
02:37:16,330 --> 02:37:17,450
Why are you guys smiling?

2211
02:37:23,220 --> 02:37:25,160
Why are we smiling now?

2212
02:37:32,210 --> 02:37:33,350
Is there anything else up here?

2213
02:37:36,850 --> 02:37:39,450
I'll take this as ammo.

2214
02:37:48,210 --> 02:37:49,770
Because I mean, so cute.

2215
02:37:52,150 --> 02:37:53,030
Stop it.

2216
02:37:56,950 --> 02:37:57,550
Sook.

2217
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:00,730
Okay, sorry, I keep saving.

2218
02:38:00,970 --> 02:38:01,430
I'm scared.

2219
02:38:02,130 --> 02:38:02,990
Wait, let me get out.

2220
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:04,970
Let me change to...

2221
02:38:06,070 --> 02:38:06,670
Shotgun.

2222
02:38:07,390 --> 02:38:08,470
I love my shotgun.

2223
02:38:10,270 --> 02:38:11,690
Oh, okay.

2224
02:38:19,250 --> 02:38:21,910
And change out of the tunnel.

2225
02:38:22,830 --> 02:38:23,010
And out.

2226
02:38:32,930 --> 02:38:33,310
Yay!

2227
02:38:39,420 --> 02:38:39,780
Yay?

2228
02:38:43,910 --> 02:38:46,710
Looking at it is that you're thick like Snake.

2229
02:38:47,170 --> 02:38:48,590
Also just got my Game Recepts Cup.

2230
02:38:48,690 --> 02:38:49,230
Thank you!

2231
02:38:49,510 --> 02:38:51,410
Hopefully there's another with your new outfit.

2232
02:38:51,590 --> 02:38:52,850
Oh, maybe one day.

2233
02:38:52,950 --> 02:38:53,850
That'd be fun.

2234
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:02,740
I can't move this guy.

2235
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:05,380
I can move that guy.

2236
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:10,480
Don't go on the sand.

2237
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:13,640
Wow, though, this is...

2238
02:39:13,640 --> 02:39:15,440
Wait, why is your supplies over there?

2239
02:39:16,540 --> 02:39:17,600
Okay, good to know.

2240
02:39:30,030 --> 02:39:32,930
But I'll stick to the road for now.

2241
02:39:38,230 --> 02:39:39,470
Or the house.

2242
02:39:41,570 --> 02:39:42,090
Or...

2243
02:39:42,090 --> 02:39:43,490
We go off the road.

2244
02:39:45,770 --> 02:39:49,530
Those guys, the things will be in the sand, though, right?

2245
02:39:49,790 --> 02:39:51,750
Whoa, pirate ship!

2246
02:39:56,050 --> 02:39:56,670
What's that music?

2247
02:40:04,350 --> 02:40:05,730
What's the music for?

2248
02:40:07,370 --> 02:40:08,750
Speaking of booty.

2249
02:40:17,990 --> 02:40:19,890
They ever released new outfit?

2250
02:40:20,270 --> 02:40:21,010
Caller?

2251
02:40:21,610 --> 02:40:21,790
What?

2252
02:40:21,950 --> 02:40:22,210
Call?

2253
02:40:23,070 --> 02:40:23,610
Kira!

2254
02:40:35,570 --> 02:40:36,590
I don't know.

2255
02:40:36,810 --> 02:40:38,430
I have to release merch.

2256
02:40:42,290 --> 02:40:45,090
I have to release merch first.

2257
02:40:48,830 --> 02:40:50,610
I see more supplies over here.

2258
02:40:50,930 --> 02:40:53,190
I don't really need health, but...

2259
02:40:53,930 --> 02:40:55,530
More suit stuff would be great.

2260
02:40:57,510 --> 02:40:57,890
Nothing!

2261
02:40:58,570 --> 02:40:59,330
Just health, okay.

2262
02:41:04,670 --> 02:41:06,230
It's a cute collar.

2263
02:41:06,490 --> 02:41:07,250
You think so?

2264
02:41:08,470 --> 02:41:09,670
Would you wear it?

2265
02:41:09,870 --> 02:41:12,090
Would you guys wear it?

2266
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:24,590
Yeah?

2267
02:41:27,930 --> 02:41:28,990
Oh, I see the guys.

2268
02:41:29,150 --> 02:41:30,970
I completely dodged them.

2269
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:31,170
Whoops.

2270
02:41:37,970 --> 02:41:38,070
Yeah.

2271
02:41:43,430 --> 02:41:44,630
Should I go in there?

2272
02:41:44,970 --> 02:41:45,350
Yeah.

2273
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:47,030
Do I need to go there?

2274
02:41:47,930 --> 02:41:49,890
If I meet the right person.

2275
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:52,130
I'd wear it if you asked me to.

2276
02:41:52,490 --> 02:41:53,910
Yeah, why am I not the right person?

2277
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:07,800
I think I got him.

2278
02:42:08,480 --> 02:42:08,780
Should I...

2279
02:42:08,780 --> 02:42:10,200
Wait, that place is on fire.

2280
02:42:21,430 --> 02:42:22,050
I saw him.

2281
02:42:22,490 --> 02:42:23,850
Wait, there's a graveyard!

2282
02:42:24,290 --> 02:42:24,930
How cute!

2283
02:42:28,220 --> 02:42:32,680
I remember spending an entire afternoon making a Gary's mod comic at this house.

2284
02:42:51,530 --> 02:42:53,170
We're having a barbecue!

2285
02:42:54,350 --> 02:42:55,090
Oh, I saw him.

2286
02:42:56,150 --> 02:42:57,010
Are you gonna come out?

2287
02:43:00,330 --> 02:43:01,450
How do I get in?

2288
02:43:02,170 --> 02:43:03,530
Wait, maybe I didn't see anybody.

2289
02:43:03,990 --> 02:43:04,690
Maybe I'm a liar.

2290
02:43:10,280 --> 02:43:11,680
Oh, that's how I get in.

2291
02:43:11,860 --> 02:43:12,140
Wait.

2292
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:15,120
I'm scared.

2293
02:43:19,470 --> 02:43:26,810
If you want to have your next off-kai meet and greet include callers for all attendees, would fit in with the spitting too.

2294
02:43:34,730 --> 02:43:35,930
This we can discuss.

2295
02:43:40,470 --> 02:43:41,990
What am I doing here?

2296
02:43:43,550 --> 02:43:46,270
Oh, I'm just shooting these guys for funsies.

2297
02:43:50,250 --> 02:43:51,350
Big plans.

2298
02:43:51,530 --> 02:43:51,810
Okay.

2299
02:43:52,690 --> 02:43:53,290
Okay.

2300
02:43:54,250 --> 02:43:55,890
We'll do that.

2301
02:43:57,130 --> 02:43:57,890
Sounds like a plan.

2302
02:43:58,250 --> 02:43:59,630
Sounds like a good idea.

2303
02:44:06,900 --> 02:44:07,740
Hello?

2304
02:44:11,380 --> 02:44:12,700
Who's in here?

2305
02:44:16,210 --> 02:44:16,570
Anybody?

2306
02:44:19,050 --> 02:44:19,470
Anyone?

2307
02:44:21,550 --> 02:44:21,950
Hello?

2308
02:44:23,010 --> 02:44:23,490
Hello?

2309
02:44:24,750 --> 02:44:26,530
How are you?

2310
02:44:52,410 --> 02:44:54,010
Oh my god.

2311
02:45:06,490 --> 02:45:07,350
Okay.

2312
02:45:13,970 --> 02:45:14,830
Handled.

2313
02:45:16,490 --> 02:45:17,250
Handled.

2314
02:45:18,750 --> 02:45:18,830
Oh!

2315
02:45:21,010 --> 02:45:21,670
Not handled!

2316
02:45:22,190 --> 02:45:22,770
Not handled!

2317
02:45:32,350 --> 02:45:34,670
There's still a guy over there.

2318
02:45:35,290 --> 02:45:36,710
But I don't think he'll bother us.

2319
02:45:36,910 --> 02:45:37,760
Unless we go out.

2320
02:45:40,270 --> 02:45:40,700
Sheesh!

2321
02:45:43,210 --> 02:45:44,070
Okay.

2322
02:45:46,190 --> 02:45:46,710
Ugh.

2323
02:45:48,130 --> 02:45:51,250
I just bolted from the...

2324
02:45:51,250 --> 02:45:53,210
I bolted from there.

2325
02:45:56,030 --> 02:45:58,390
I've never felt more...

2326
02:45:58,390 --> 02:45:59,910
more like of a...

2327
02:46:00,630 --> 02:46:02,030
of a re...

2328
02:46:02,030 --> 02:46:05,970
like I felt so sure about that in my whole afterlife.

2329
02:46:06,210 --> 02:46:06,950
Oh man!

2330
02:46:07,670 --> 02:46:10,990
I guess this is another place to get the crossbow if you haven't gotten it already.

2331
02:46:12,250 --> 02:46:13,670
Which is pretty nice.

2332
02:46:15,810 --> 02:46:16,370
Wee ball?

2333
02:46:16,910 --> 02:46:18,910
Effit, we ball...

2334
02:46:19,950 --> 02:46:21,070
Can I fall through?

2335
02:46:21,410 --> 02:46:21,570
No?

2336
02:46:23,450 --> 02:46:23,530
Okay.

2337
02:46:28,550 --> 02:46:29,310
Phew!

2338
02:46:30,490 --> 02:46:31,490
Alright, alright.

2339
02:46:33,590 --> 02:46:34,230
Good stuff.

2340
02:46:34,690 --> 02:46:38,290
I think that was worth going a little side trip.

2341
02:46:42,510 --> 02:46:43,910
That scared me!

2342
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:50,200
Too thick to fall through!

2343
02:46:51,480 --> 02:46:53,080
It do be like that.

2344
02:47:03,860 --> 02:47:05,060
Savings to that.

2345
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:06,680
I'm already in the car.

2346
02:47:16,610 --> 02:47:17,250
Does that reach?

2347
02:47:17,430 --> 02:47:17,870
Oh, it does.

2348
02:47:32,660 --> 02:47:34,100
You can charge the gun.

2349
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:36,560
Whoa!

2350
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:40,580
Nice, thank you.

2351
02:47:40,660 --> 02:47:41,700
I did not know that.

2352
02:47:52,600 --> 02:47:53,920
Come here.

2353
02:47:54,480 --> 02:47:55,300
Come here.

2354
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:59,940
Yeah, growling you all you want.

2355
02:48:00,180 --> 02:48:01,460
I hate these things.

2356
02:48:06,430 --> 02:48:07,270
I hate them.

2357
02:48:09,690 --> 02:48:10,410
Soop.

2358
02:48:10,410 --> 02:48:11,270
Come here, you too.

2359
02:48:14,430 --> 02:48:14,810
Yep.

2360
02:48:16,750 --> 02:48:16,930
Yep.

2361
02:48:24,710 --> 02:48:26,790
Anyone else want a piece of me?

2362
02:48:31,210 --> 02:48:32,090
I go check it out.

2363
02:48:32,170 --> 02:48:34,450
I'm gonna go check it out.

2364
02:48:42,310 --> 02:48:45,170
Whoa, something exploded that hurt my ears.

2365
02:48:48,130 --> 02:48:51,210
Encouragement for upcoming Gundam card game tournament this weekend.

2366
02:48:51,350 --> 02:48:56,530
I'm having fun, but so far I'm 3-14, and so if I could win even just one game, I'd be super proud of myself.

2367
02:48:56,970 --> 02:48:57,590
Wait, what do you mean?

2368
02:48:57,710 --> 02:48:58,390
3-14!

2369
02:48:59,050 --> 02:49:01,010
That sounds like you won a couple, no?

2370
02:49:03,110 --> 02:49:03,510
No?

2371
02:49:07,470 --> 02:49:08,350
But you got this!

2372
02:49:08,410 --> 02:49:08,850
Good luck!

2373
02:49:09,130 --> 02:49:09,770
Have fun!

2374
02:49:13,930 --> 02:49:14,730
You got this!

2375
02:49:14,770 --> 02:49:17,310
If I can play this game, you can win.

2376
02:49:18,610 --> 02:49:19,230
I believe.

2377
02:49:21,110 --> 02:49:21,390
Hello?

2378
02:49:22,590 --> 02:49:23,670
I heard another guy.

2379
02:49:26,290 --> 02:49:27,870
100% I heard another guy.

2380
02:49:43,470 --> 02:49:45,270
I'm listening to his footsteps.

2381
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:53,460
Another man?

2382
02:49:58,020 --> 02:49:59,280
We got him.

2383
02:50:08,870 --> 02:50:10,190
He dead.

2384
02:50:11,310 --> 02:50:11,530
Whoa!

2385
02:50:13,470 --> 02:50:14,070
What?

2386
02:50:14,770 --> 02:50:15,150
Whoa!

2387
02:50:15,870 --> 02:50:16,110
Whoa!

2388
02:50:17,010 --> 02:50:17,950
What a pattern.

2389
02:50:19,350 --> 02:50:19,910
That guy.

2390
02:50:21,990 --> 02:50:23,190
Oh, look at that!

2391
02:50:24,030 --> 02:50:25,610
That's kind of kind.

2392
02:50:26,550 --> 02:50:28,130
Wish they had one for my suit too.

2393
02:50:30,330 --> 02:50:31,250
Ho-key!

2394
02:50:32,270 --> 02:50:32,650
Ooh!

2395
02:50:35,370 --> 02:50:35,970
Cute!

2396
02:50:40,890 --> 02:50:41,490
Um...

2397
02:50:41,490 --> 02:50:42,310
Did I just go on through?

2398
02:50:43,130 --> 02:50:43,750
I guess so.

2399
02:50:45,590 --> 02:50:47,350
Can I, like, lift this?

2400
02:50:50,130 --> 02:50:50,730
No?

2401
02:50:51,070 --> 02:50:52,510
I just blast through it.

2402
02:50:53,410 --> 02:50:55,270
Let's just try blast it.

2403
02:50:56,630 --> 02:50:58,190
No, no, Grand Bathroom.

2404
02:50:59,930 --> 02:51:00,530
Riot!

2405
02:51:03,570 --> 02:51:05,130
Ram and speed.

2406
02:51:05,670 --> 02:51:08,990
Yep, we're gonna go full full power.

2407
02:51:10,590 --> 02:51:11,430
Oh, gosh.

2408
02:51:12,270 --> 02:51:12,350
Uh.

2409
02:51:14,010 --> 02:51:16,330
Okay, let's try that one more time.

2410
02:51:19,330 --> 02:51:21,070
Oh, wait, those lifted up.

2411
02:51:21,290 --> 02:51:21,590
Wait.

2412
02:51:23,690 --> 02:51:24,070
Wait.

2413
02:51:24,670 --> 02:51:30,370
I could drive just fine, everybody.

2414
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:06,500
Why is every place such an infrastructural mess?

2415
02:52:10,140 --> 02:52:10,820
Hmm,

2416
02:52:19,740 --> 02:52:20,800
I thought it would explode.

2417
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:28,840
Sort of the apocalypse happened.

2418
02:52:29,140 --> 02:52:30,120
Yeah, but surely.

2419
02:52:32,500 --> 02:52:34,960
Where are my tax dollars going to?

2420
02:52:43,480 --> 02:52:45,520
This place seems kind of sus.

2421
02:52:49,140 --> 02:52:50,860
Cue the sussy music.

2422
02:52:56,020 --> 02:52:57,380
Oh, no, no!

2423
02:53:02,650 --> 02:53:04,110
Wait, those are different.

2424
02:53:31,390 --> 02:53:33,690
It looks like a... like a tarantula.

2425
02:53:37,750 --> 02:53:38,790
Oh, my gosh.

2426
02:53:39,430 --> 02:53:40,210
I'm getting ambushed.

2427
02:54:08,010 --> 02:54:08,490
How...

2428
02:54:08,490 --> 02:54:09,650
Throwing grenades at me!

2429
02:54:12,410 --> 02:54:13,430
Who else is she?

2430
02:54:13,490 --> 02:54:13,790
Oh, you.

2431
02:54:14,930 --> 02:54:15,690
I'm here.

2432
02:54:17,550 --> 02:54:18,150
Oh.

2433
02:54:27,540 --> 02:54:28,560
You could throw them back?

2434
02:54:28,900 --> 02:54:29,840
You could throw the grenades!

2435
02:54:31,060 --> 02:54:31,760
No way!

2436
02:54:32,860 --> 02:54:34,120
I didn't know that at all.

2437
02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:36,140
Quit being so grenadible.

2438
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:39,220
It's just part of my time.

2439
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:43,640
Hot dog and date.

2440
02:54:46,360 --> 02:54:51,440
Is this a trap or contraption?

2441
02:54:53,880 --> 02:54:56,080
Oh, someone had a bad day.

2442
02:55:01,240 --> 02:55:03,100
Combine gunships and dropships.

2443
02:55:04,120 --> 02:55:04,220
Wait.

2444
02:55:04,960 --> 02:55:08,700
Combine both mechanical and organic parts somewhat like geckos and MGR.

2445
02:55:10,060 --> 02:55:10,460
Oh.

2446
02:55:11,380 --> 02:55:12,000
Oh!

2447
02:55:17,670 --> 02:55:18,820
We got him.

2448
02:55:27,930 --> 02:55:29,170
Get souped.

2449
02:55:29,470 --> 02:55:30,550
I'm starting to get hungry.

2450
02:55:30,670 --> 02:55:31,350
That's what I'm getting.

2451
02:55:32,030 --> 02:55:33,750
But I had dinner before.

2452
02:55:35,110 --> 02:55:36,290
Before stream.

2453
02:55:36,450 --> 02:55:37,270
So I'm kind of like,

2454
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:43,660
Okay, so we're trying to raise this.

2455
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:45,680
Okay.

2456
02:55:49,080 --> 02:55:50,020
What did I have?

2457
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:51,720
I had one slice of pizza.

2458
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:53,880
Leftover pizza.

2459
02:55:54,960 --> 02:55:55,780
A couple days old.

2460
02:56:05,710 --> 02:56:08,310
Do I need to find more of them?

2461
02:56:08,650 --> 02:56:09,090
I suppose?

2462
02:56:09,250 --> 02:56:10,370
Oh, so like this.

2463
02:56:13,810 --> 02:56:15,910
Okay, now we just need to find one more.

2464
02:56:16,510 --> 02:56:17,030
Okay.

2465
02:56:22,790 --> 02:56:23,190
Um...

2466
02:56:23,190 --> 02:56:24,470
Does it look like a cinder block?

2467
02:56:31,410 --> 02:56:31,810
Hmm...

2468
02:56:33,690 --> 02:56:34,090
Or...

2469
02:56:34,670 --> 02:56:37,030
I can't tell if it's that I need to find one more.

2470
02:56:37,130 --> 02:56:38,950
We'll just do a quick little sweep.

2471
02:56:39,530 --> 02:56:42,050
And if not, maybe they have to be in like a...

2472
02:56:45,550 --> 02:56:45,950
Like...

2473
02:56:47,410 --> 02:56:48,150
What's the word?

2474
02:56:48,370 --> 02:56:50,510
Like, they need to be in a certain order.

2475
02:56:52,370 --> 02:56:53,350
My sweep?

2476
02:56:53,870 --> 02:56:54,490
I didn't see it.

2477
02:57:01,560 --> 02:57:03,540
Oh no, it definitely needs to be all three.

2478
02:57:10,320 --> 02:57:11,380
Can I climb

2479
02:57:14,770 --> 02:57:15,250
that?

2480
02:57:15,690 --> 02:57:16,070
What?

2481
02:57:17,230 --> 02:57:17,790
Aha!

2482
02:57:30,490 --> 02:57:31,050
Easy!

2483
02:57:40,610 --> 02:57:42,350
But, uh, how do I get around?

2484
02:57:46,600 --> 02:57:48,380
We're not leaving my car behind.

2485
02:57:58,840 --> 02:57:59,240
Slope?

2486
02:58:00,640 --> 02:58:01,200
Was there one?

2487
02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:02,540
Here?

2488
02:58:02,740 --> 02:58:03,340
Oh, I see.

2489
02:58:03,460 --> 02:58:03,900
I see it.

2490
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:04,320
Yeah, yeah.

2491
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:05,660
You're right.

2492
02:58:06,200 --> 02:58:06,760
Ah, cool.

2493
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:19,060
Easy.

2494
02:58:19,840 --> 02:58:22,660
Unless your slice of pizza was at least a quarter pizza.

2495
02:58:22,940 --> 02:58:23,840
That's more of a snack.

2496
02:58:24,420 --> 02:58:24,820
No!

2497
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:27,400
Oh.

2498
02:58:32,360 --> 02:58:33,380
Please, no more tunnel.

2499
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:34,820
We're going through this tunnel.

2500
02:58:35,580 --> 02:58:36,840
We're not going to be in the tunnel.

2501
02:58:37,440 --> 02:58:38,400
We're going through the tunnel.

2502
02:58:38,960 --> 02:58:40,440
We won't be in the tunnel.

2503
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:42,440
We're going through the tunnel.

2504
02:58:49,240 --> 02:58:50,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2505
02:58:51,800 --> 02:58:53,380
Wow, it's so beautiful!

2506
02:58:56,080 --> 02:58:58,360
Is this the lighthouse place we need to get to?

2507
02:58:59,120 --> 02:59:00,240
Are we finally home?

2508
02:59:04,770 --> 02:59:06,030
That looks like a friend.

2509
02:59:07,670 --> 02:59:08,070
Yes!

2510
02:59:10,390 --> 02:59:10,830
Hey,

2511
02:59:15,280 --> 02:59:15,860
over here!

2512
02:59:16,160 --> 02:59:17,160
You made it!

2513
02:59:17,740 --> 02:59:18,760
We're picking up radio chatter.

2514
02:59:19,120 --> 02:59:20,180
They're looking for your car.

2515
02:59:21,420 --> 02:59:22,420
Put your car in the garage.

2516
02:59:23,920 --> 02:59:24,220
Oh.

2517
02:59:25,100 --> 02:59:26,960
You want me to...

2518
02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:28,720
I've done a lot of driving, sir.

2519
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:30,440
If you could just back it up for me.

2520
02:59:33,340 --> 02:59:33,980
You know?

2521
02:59:34,140 --> 02:59:36,980
It would be really, really helpful.

2522
02:59:39,220 --> 02:59:45,660
Okay, I'll do my best.

2523
02:59:47,500 --> 02:59:47,820
Oh!

2524
02:59:48,180 --> 02:59:49,280
Get your car in the garage.

2525
02:59:49,740 --> 02:59:50,700
I did, sir.

2526
02:59:54,140 --> 02:59:54,800
Okay, Doc.

2527
02:59:55,220 --> 02:59:56,260
You'll have to go on foot from here.

2528
02:59:56,640 --> 03:00:00,900
There's a secret path along the cliffside, but no one's going anywhere until we fight off this attack.

2529
03:00:01,920 --> 03:00:04,800
Having you here to fight alongside us is going to make a big difference for morale.

2530
03:00:06,860 --> 03:00:07,220
Attack.

2531
03:00:07,680 --> 03:00:07,880
Crap.

2532
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:09,360
Here come the dropships.

2533
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:09,580
Uh-oh.

2534
03:00:09,600 --> 03:00:13,000
I didn't

2535
03:00:24,830 --> 03:00:25,750
even get to

2536
03:00:30,850 --> 03:00:35,090
Oh my gosh how did I miss I'm also ducking

2537
03:00:42,620 --> 03:00:43,800
What is happening?

2538
03:00:44,040 --> 03:01:00,020
Oh they're dropping men Oh my gosh Is there any more Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Drop ship, come- oh, drop- not drop ship, drop- drop ship.

2539
03:01:05,070 --> 03:01:06,070
Watch out friends!

2540
03:01:07,090 --> 03:01:08,590
Wait, that's not a good gun for this.

2541
03:01:09,490 --> 03:01:10,050
Don't mind me.

2542
03:01:11,230 --> 03:01:12,210
I'm just switching guns!

2543
03:01:13,450 --> 03:01:13,850
Grenade!

2544
03:01:14,570 --> 03:01:14,970
Oh!

2545
03:01:16,970 --> 03:01:17,630
I'm hurt.

2546
03:01:25,420 --> 03:01:26,020
Oh, that's a friend.

2547
03:01:26,220 --> 03:01:26,500
That's a friend.

2548
03:01:26,700 --> 03:01:26,980
My bad.

2549
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:29,200
Don't mind me.

2550
03:01:30,960 --> 03:01:31,840
Oh, that's a friend.

2551
03:01:32,400 --> 03:01:33,760
Sorry, you guys are so confusing.

2552
03:01:39,790 --> 03:01:41,570
Uh, I dropped myself.

2553
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:48,180
Nice, good job, team.

2554
03:01:49,100 --> 03:01:51,200
Um, do you guys have any, like, um, things?

2555
03:01:54,320 --> 03:01:55,600
Oh, thank you!

2556
03:01:55,940 --> 03:01:56,820
Ah, they're so sweet.

2557
03:01:56,960 --> 03:01:58,460
I didn't expect this to happen.

2558
03:01:58,880 --> 03:02:00,640
I thought I was gonna have a nice little...

2559
03:02:04,960 --> 03:02:08,560
Um, thanks for the dropship, or...

2560
03:02:09,280 --> 03:02:09,980

2561
03:02:09,980 --> 03:02:10,720
Am I SOL?

2562
03:02:11,860 --> 03:02:13,540

Oh, I'm out.

2568
03:03:42,890 --> 03:03:43,890
I can't shoot with this thing.

2569
03:03:45,990 --> 03:03:46,490
Maybe I can.

2570
03:03:47,590 --> 03:03:48,210
Maybe I can.

2571
03:03:51,290 --> 03:03:51,850
Gunship!

2572
03:03:54,010 --> 03:03:55,470
Oh, okay, thanks.

2573
03:03:56,870 --> 03:03:58,450
That's what I was asking about!

2574
03:03:59,710 --> 03:04:01,310
That's all I needed to hear!

2575
03:04:09,180 --> 03:04:11,860
Full of rockets, that's all I need to know!

2576
03:04:13,020 --> 03:04:13,360
Oh my gosh.

2577
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:15,520
Don't die on me, everybody.

2578
03:04:16,200 --> 03:04:18,880
Where are all the rockets this place is full of?

2579
03:04:21,320 --> 03:04:22,400
Oh, upwards.

2580
03:04:28,230 --> 03:04:29,210
Oh, here they are.

2581
03:04:30,650 --> 03:04:31,130
Nope.

2582
03:04:31,630 --> 03:04:31,850
Yes?

2583
03:04:33,110 --> 03:04:33,890
There we go.

2584
03:04:34,830 --> 03:04:36,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2585
03:04:37,870 --> 03:04:38,190
Okay.

2586
03:04:38,850 --> 03:04:39,330
Ow!

2587
03:04:43,560 --> 03:04:44,040
noise

2588
03:04:56,170 --> 03:04:59,870
let's grab some more while we're here okay

2589
03:05:09,860 --> 03:05:14,180
I like the way it screams well I'm gonna go get more health

2590
03:05:17,460 --> 03:05:21,940
I will save actually more

2591
03:05:26,900 --> 03:05:33,320
oh no oh I'm I can't

2592
03:05:50,080 --> 03:05:51,620
What are these?

2593
03:05:59,850 --> 03:06:00,310
Saved.

2594
03:06:01,230 --> 03:06:02,310
Did anybody survive?

2595
03:06:03,950 --> 03:06:03,990
Oh!

2596
03:06:05,030 --> 03:06:05,930
This way, Dr. Freeman.

2597
03:06:06,270 --> 03:06:08,590
We'll take the cliff path before another gunship finds us.

2598
03:06:08,990 --> 03:06:09,030
Okay.

2599
03:06:11,910 --> 03:06:13,630
That one was easy because it...

2600
03:06:13,630 --> 03:06:14,010
Oh, sorry.

2601
03:06:14,130 --> 03:06:14,810
This is your stuff.

2602
03:06:15,070 --> 03:06:16,410
I'm just used to blasting everything.

2603
03:06:18,710 --> 03:06:22,870
Um, that one was easy because the lighthouse provided good protection.

2604
03:06:25,170 --> 03:06:26,550
Oh, pistol ammo.

2605
03:06:26,850 --> 03:06:27,830
Why would they give that?

2606
03:06:31,230 --> 03:06:32,290
Oh my gosh, more?

2607
03:06:33,770 --> 03:06:35,210
All right, Dr. Freeman.

2608
03:06:35,430 --> 03:06:35,950
Come with me.

2609
03:06:36,230 --> 03:06:37,130
Before another one comes.

2610
03:06:37,230 --> 03:06:37,410
Yep.

2611
03:06:37,590 --> 03:06:39,170
I'm right behind you, buddy.

2612
03:06:39,210 --> 03:06:39,850
Right along there.

2613
03:06:40,690 --> 03:06:41,710
And watch your step.

2614
03:06:42,030 --> 03:06:42,610
Right along where?

2615
03:06:44,150 --> 03:06:44,830
What am I?

2616
03:06:45,850 --> 03:06:46,290
Oh!

2617
03:06:48,470 --> 03:06:49,050
Whoa.

2618
03:06:56,290 --> 03:06:56,870
Oh.

2619
03:06:59,930 --> 03:07:00,510
Ouch!

2620
03:07:02,250 --> 03:07:04,390
Why, you could have warned me there were still guys.

2621
03:07:05,390 --> 03:07:06,170
Oh my gosh.

2622
03:07:06,530 --> 03:07:06,950
I'm running.

2623
03:07:15,930 --> 03:07:18,710
No, this is also just like the first game.

2624
03:07:19,930 --> 03:07:21,510
Where there was the gunship.

2625
03:07:22,110 --> 03:07:22,370
Uh.

2626
03:07:26,290 --> 03:07:27,910
Wait, they took my car?

2627
03:07:28,070 --> 03:07:28,690
No way!

2628
03:07:30,850 --> 03:07:32,730
Did the guy survive?

2629
03:07:36,410 --> 03:07:37,690
Missed the car being stolen.

2630
03:07:38,030 --> 03:07:39,130
Sorry, I was a little panicked.

2631
03:07:40,010 --> 03:07:41,350
Trying to just leave.

2632
03:07:43,150 --> 03:07:44,830
Wait, the baddies took my car!

2633
03:07:53,690 --> 03:07:54,490
It's me!

2634
03:07:54,810 --> 03:07:55,170
You there!

2635
03:07:55,550 --> 03:07:55,630
Stop!

2636
03:07:55,930 --> 03:07:56,590
You idiot!

2637
03:07:56,890 --> 03:07:58,770
Walking on the sand, bring down my ass!

2638
03:07:59,350 --> 03:08:04,050
He told me...

2639
03:08:04,050 --> 03:08:06,190
Dear God, poor Laszlo!

2640
03:08:07,150 --> 03:08:08,910
The finest mind of his generation!

2641
03:08:10,970 --> 03:08:39,950
an end we were heading for the vortigon camp hoping to pick up some bug baits of these damn things and leave us alone without Laszlo what's the point I know you tried to help I'll stay with him a while there's something I have to do go ahead I hope you have better luck than we had wait could I prevent this remember to stay off the sand the ant lions are edgy right now

2642
03:08:46,750 --> 03:08:48,590
Can I redo this?

2643
03:08:59,800 --> 03:09:00,240
Laszlo!

2644
03:09:06,110 --> 03:09:07,610
Here, I'm gonna reload.

2645
03:09:08,030 --> 03:09:08,190
Wait.

2646
03:09:09,170 --> 03:09:10,530
I'm guessing this is it.

2647
03:09:10,730 --> 03:09:11,330
Auto save.

2648
03:09:11,610 --> 03:09:11,810
Yeah, yeah.

2649
03:09:11,990 --> 03:09:12,790
Let's try it.

2650
03:09:12,930 --> 03:09:13,470
Okay, okay.

2651
03:09:15,910 --> 03:09:17,410
He's gonna tell me not to go out.

2652
03:09:17,490 --> 03:09:19,710
I would have listened to his full spiel, you know?

2653
03:09:23,170 --> 03:09:40,930
also sorry they talk so low but the game is pretty loud if the game is ever too low or anything just tell me you there stop where you are stay on the rocks okay don't step on the sand it makes the ant lions crazy lazlo don't move oh i

2654
03:09:44,410 --> 03:09:55,050
know it's pretty late in the stream to say that but poor lazlo the finest mind of his generation Oh, it's Laszlo's fault.

2655
03:09:56,230 --> 03:09:59,130
Hoping to pick up some bug baits of these damn things and leave us alone.

2656
03:09:59,310 --> 03:10:01,450
The finest mind of our generation.

2657
03:10:02,130 --> 03:10:02,830
What's the point?

2658
03:10:04,230 --> 03:10:05,430
I know you tried to help.

2659
03:10:06,210 --> 03:10:07,350
I'll stay with them a while.

2660
03:10:07,490 --> 03:10:08,730
I'm gonna eat some Reese's pieces.

2661
03:10:08,810 --> 03:10:09,490
There's something I have to do.

2662
03:10:11,130 --> 03:10:11,670
Go ahead.

2663
03:10:12,390 --> 03:10:13,930
I hope you have better luck than we had.

2664
03:10:14,450 --> 03:10:15,010
What's the point?

2665
03:10:15,090 --> 03:10:16,330
My ass is already big.

2666
03:10:18,330 --> 03:10:18,790
Oh, hot.

2667
03:10:18,810 --> 03:10:20,090
Remember to stay off the sand.

2668
03:10:20,210 --> 03:10:20,430
Okay.

2669
03:10:20,530 --> 03:10:22,070
The ant lions are edgy right now.

2670
03:10:22,230 --> 03:10:22,690
Oh, Bob.

2671
03:10:23,190 --> 03:10:24,650
It's

2672
03:10:31,880 --> 03:10:32,750
because I'm hungry.

2673
03:10:38,940 --> 03:10:39,960
You'll make it, right, buddy?

2674
03:10:43,140 --> 03:10:45,600
That supplies, though.

2675
03:10:52,110 --> 03:10:53,570
Uh, come on.

2676
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:56,570
Yeah.

2677
03:10:57,770 --> 03:11:03,590
Can I get this too?

2678
03:11:05,970 --> 03:11:06,470
Oh, I can.

2679
03:11:07,610 --> 03:11:08,170
Come on.

2680
03:11:09,150 --> 03:11:10,010
Little baby?

2681
03:11:10,190 --> 03:11:10,570
What's that?

2682
03:11:15,060 --> 03:11:15,640
What's this?

2683
03:11:16,140 --> 03:11:16,180
Oh.

2684
03:11:16,960 --> 03:11:18,140
Whatever it is, I'm taking it.

2685
03:11:19,800 --> 03:11:21,860
Thin mints ain't got nothing on thick mints.

2686
03:11:23,900 --> 03:11:25,660
Find this ass of our generation.

2687
03:11:26,100 --> 03:11:26,980
Shut up.

2688
03:11:28,220 --> 03:11:30,620
Stop talking about my butt.

2689
03:11:30,820 --> 03:11:31,480
I'm insecure.

2690
03:11:32,980 --> 03:11:34,180
I'm insecure.

2691
03:11:34,500 --> 03:11:41,160
I know what for Oh, I'm full What are those

2692
03:11:45,090 --> 03:11:46,950
What is the alt on this thing

2693
03:11:54,400 --> 03:12:05,620
Well, that sucks SMG grenade Ah, okay, okay Oh, yeah, you're right I should be using this, huh?

2694
03:12:06,380 --> 03:12:08,640
Okay, uh, I saved And

2695
03:12:13,290 --> 03:12:13,850
Woo!

2696
03:12:14,650 --> 03:12:15,270
We're gaming?

2697
03:12:22,380 --> 03:12:22,740
Nice.

2698
03:12:33,590 --> 03:12:34,310
I'm cut.

2699
03:12:42,340 --> 03:12:44,540
I'm afraid you're going to have to stop talking about it first.

2700
03:12:46,820 --> 03:12:50,180
I wonder if I can, like, oh, I guess, let's try it alone.

2701
03:12:50,840 --> 03:12:54,860
I was going to say, like, if I could grab it and, like, move it.

2702
03:12:54,980 --> 03:12:58,240
But, of course, why do they respond to the stuff on the same?

2703
03:12:58,260 --> 03:13:00,400
and moving, but they don't respond to it.

2704
03:13:02,220 --> 03:13:10,220
Me on, like, or rather they respond to me on the sand, but not me moving things on the sand.

2705
03:13:10,380 --> 03:13:11,080
It's kind of funny.

2706
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:16,420
Little inconsistent if you ask me.

2707
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:22,700
In fact, I think that's exactly what I need to do here.

2708
03:13:24,200 --> 03:13:26,420
Ah, no, don't break, please.

2709
03:13:28,260 --> 03:13:28,600
Eh.

2710
03:13:29,660 --> 03:13:30,460
I'm heavier?

2711
03:13:41,320 --> 03:13:43,380
I'll leave you there.

2712
03:13:44,840 --> 03:13:46,040
Wait, can I make this?

2713
03:13:48,320 --> 03:13:48,600
Oh!

2714
03:13:49,960 --> 03:13:51,560
Because of the supply!

2715
03:13:52,340 --> 03:13:53,960
I was able to make it!

2716
03:13:54,220 --> 03:13:55,020
Ha ha ha ha.

2717
03:14:03,640 --> 03:14:04,720
Wait, uh...

2718
03:14:04,720 --> 03:14:06,140
Oh, did I have my SMG?

2719
03:14:21,220 --> 03:14:41,960

2721
03:14:54,740 --> 03:14:55,420
What do I hear?

2722
03:14:56,220 --> 03:14:56,800
What was that?

2723
03:15:02,790 --> 03:15:02,970
Hmm.

2724
03:15:07,590 --> 03:15:08,510
Chess out.

2725
03:15:15,840 --> 03:15:17,460
It's an annoying achievement.

2726
03:15:17,620 --> 03:15:17,900
Yeah.

2727
03:15:18,400 --> 03:15:19,840
I don't want the pressure, you know.

2728
03:15:27,660 --> 03:15:28,600
Love your new outfit!

2729
03:15:29,020 --> 03:15:30,980
Why does it give off Fujoshi vibes?

2730
03:15:31,680 --> 03:15:32,200
Why not?

2731
03:15:32,320 --> 03:15:33,180
I'm a...

2732
03:15:37,140 --> 03:15:38,220
You know?

2733
03:15:41,060 --> 03:15:41,880
Oh no, wait.

2734
03:15:43,340 --> 03:15:44,480
I see, I see.

2735
03:15:45,260 --> 03:15:47,760
This needs to tilt up.

2736
03:16:07,200 --> 03:16:07,740
Oh,

2737
03:16:10,780 --> 03:16:11,040
okay.

2738
03:16:11,300 --> 03:16:14,660
We got multiple places to go.

2739
03:16:16,080 --> 03:16:16,560
Fun.

2740
03:16:21,650 --> 03:16:22,470
Yeah, we're gaming.

2741
03:16:23,710 --> 03:16:24,450
Oh, look at all that support.

2742
03:16:24,470 --> 03:16:25,250
supplies over there.

2743
03:16:25,470 --> 03:16:26,310
Sweet, sweet supplies.

2744
03:16:26,850 --> 03:16:29,410
I don't really need it, but I want it anyway.

2745
03:16:36,050 --> 03:16:36,590
Oh.

2746
03:16:39,110 --> 03:16:39,950
No one in here?

2747
03:16:40,750 --> 03:16:40,990
Really?

2748
03:16:42,830 --> 03:16:43,370
Okay.

2749
03:16:44,570 --> 03:16:46,370
Wow, lots of stuff though.

2750
03:16:47,410 --> 03:16:48,250
I'll take it.

2751
03:16:55,940 --> 03:16:56,480
Oh!

2752
03:16:58,560 --> 03:17:00,540
You think I can still grab it?

2753
03:17:00,560 --> 03:17:02,620
Oops, that's not... that's not right.

2754
03:17:07,260 --> 03:17:08,280
Oh, nice!

2755
03:17:09,020 --> 03:17:10,060
We're fine.

2756
03:17:10,340 --> 03:17:11,200
Everything's good.

2757
03:17:12,780 --> 03:17:15,040
Wait, there's actually so much loot around here.

2758
03:17:15,160 --> 03:17:16,120
Wait, that makes me nervous.

2759
03:17:17,520 --> 03:17:19,160
But you have to work for it.

2760
03:17:20,760 --> 03:17:23,020
It's not just easy to get to loot.

2761
03:17:25,340 --> 03:17:25,900
So...

2762
03:17:26,460 --> 03:17:27,020
Yeah.

2763
03:17:29,860 --> 03:17:30,540
I just...

2764
03:17:30,560 --> 03:17:32,460
notice, how am I going to get back up there?

2765
03:17:33,620 --> 03:17:33,960
Hmm.

2766
03:17:37,060 --> 03:17:37,480
Um.

2767
03:17:46,840 --> 03:17:47,320
Okay.

2768
03:17:48,860 --> 03:17:49,280
Uh.

2769
03:17:50,720 --> 03:17:51,920
I wish I could...

2770
03:17:51,920 --> 03:17:54,880
One bad thing about this is you can't turn it.

2771
03:17:55,500 --> 03:17:55,980
Mom.

2772
03:17:57,860 --> 03:18:00,260
You guys don't call out to your mom when you're in trouble?

2773
03:18:05,220 --> 03:18:06,460
It's too short.

2774
03:18:06,700 --> 03:18:07,160
Yeah.

2775
03:18:11,960 --> 03:18:17,400
Okay, I made another thing for me to jump on.

2776
03:18:20,620 --> 03:18:22,580
Dama, thank you so much for the redirect.

2777
03:18:22,940 --> 03:18:23,180
Thank you.

2778
03:18:23,680 --> 03:18:25,960
Welcome, welcome.

2779
03:18:34,010 --> 03:18:34,350
Ouch.

2780
03:18:40,780 --> 03:18:41,820
That's fine.

2781
03:18:42,500 --> 03:18:43,600
I didn't need that.

2782
03:18:49,200 --> 03:19:00,180
physics physics are really scary oh my gosh how am I supposed to get out of here I think I'm supposed to run for

2783
03:19:06,590 --> 03:19:19,890
oh oh do I go thank you so much for the five gift and thank you a little bit of a there we go there we go okay okay

2784
03:19:24,390 --> 03:19:26,110
Oops, I jumped, but I didn't.

2785
03:19:26,250 --> 03:19:26,730
Oh, shoot.

2786
03:19:28,070 --> 03:19:28,810
Uh, ah!

2787
03:19:29,610 --> 03:19:30,190
Oh!

2788
03:19:36,380 --> 03:19:37,400
Why did you show up?

2789
03:19:38,440 --> 03:19:38,960
Where

2790
03:19:42,820 --> 03:19:43,700
did you guys come from?

2791
03:19:46,500 --> 03:19:47,480
Eh, whatever.

2792
03:19:52,280 --> 03:19:53,160
Eh, whatever.

2793
03:19:55,420 --> 03:19:56,060
Please.

2794
03:19:56,360 --> 03:19:57,080
Please, soup.

2795
03:19:57,880 --> 03:19:58,460
We're souping?

2796
03:20:01,740 --> 03:20:02,100
No.

2797
03:20:02,880 --> 03:20:03,520
Nice.

2798
03:20:03,880 --> 03:20:04,440
I hit you?

2799
03:20:05,440 --> 03:20:06,420
Too far.

2800
03:20:08,700 --> 03:20:09,900
Wow, take that.

2801
03:20:19,980 --> 03:20:21,060
Good stuff.

2802
03:20:24,430 --> 03:20:24,970
Thumper.

2803
03:20:25,730 --> 03:20:27,410
A soup.

2804
03:20:29,030 --> 03:20:32,610
Try picking up a door or something else with a grab gun while standing on it.

2805
03:20:33,670 --> 03:20:34,410
Can you do that?

2806
03:20:36,570 --> 03:20:37,610
Wait, like this?

2807
03:20:43,030 --> 03:20:43,570
Ugh.

2808
03:20:44,590 --> 03:20:46,550
It didn't work.

2809
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:56,460
That's a lot of exploding barrels over there.

2810
03:20:57,060 --> 03:20:57,700
Over yonder.

2811
03:20:59,060 --> 03:20:59,820
Alright, I run.

2812
03:21:01,360 --> 03:21:01,540
Oops.

2813
03:21:33,770 --> 03:21:34,490
Uh...

2814
03:21:34,490 --> 03:21:36,330
Am I supposed to make this jump?

2815
03:21:37,270 --> 03:21:37,610
Wait!

2816
03:21:37,890 --> 03:21:38,930
Oh my gosh.

2817
03:21:42,750 --> 03:21:43,830
I see.

2818
03:21:44,990 --> 03:21:45,370
Oops.

2819
03:21:49,010 --> 03:21:49,710
Come on!

2820
03:22:00,580 --> 03:22:02,460
The soup job.

2821
03:22:03,800 --> 03:22:04,460
What are these?

2822
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:06,000
Are these for the SMG?

2823
03:22:19,360 --> 03:22:20,350
Pulse rifle.

2824
03:22:21,510 --> 03:22:21,670
Ah.

2825
03:22:31,190 --> 03:22:32,630
How do I get up?

2826
03:22:34,610 --> 03:22:36,170
Is there anything around?

2827
03:22:39,130 --> 03:22:41,910
Vivi-Court, thank you for the...

2828
03:22:43,010 --> 03:22:43,670
Gifted?

2829
03:22:49,280 --> 03:22:50,290
I know the area.

2830
03:22:51,490 --> 03:22:52,590
It is quite quiet.

2831
03:22:53,470 --> 03:22:54,430
I'll turn it up a little bit.

2832
03:22:54,650 --> 03:22:55,090
But sorry.

2833
03:22:55,670 --> 03:22:59,670
Actually, let me see if there's like a options audio.

2834
03:23:02,230 --> 03:23:03,210
Yeah, there's no like.

2835
03:23:03,650 --> 03:23:03,930
I've.

2836
03:23:05,110 --> 03:23:09,230
All shooty games should have a way to turn down the shooting audio.

2837
03:23:10,290 --> 03:23:11,230
They all should.

2838
03:23:13,570 --> 03:23:14,470
I apologize.

2839
03:23:28,830 --> 03:23:30,370
Can I pick this guy up?

2840
03:23:31,790 --> 03:23:32,310
No.

2841
03:23:33,250 --> 03:23:34,570
I'm getting souped.

2842
03:23:34,630 --> 03:23:36,450
I'm getting told soup.

2843
03:23:40,790 --> 03:23:41,310
Um...

2844
03:23:41,310 --> 03:23:43,010
Flash and make my free yogurt.

2845
03:23:43,590 --> 03:23:43,890
Oh wait!

2846
03:23:44,210 --> 03:23:45,010
There's these guys.

2847
03:23:51,410 --> 03:23:54,870
I don't know if this is the intended method, but...

2848
03:23:54,870 --> 03:23:55,450
Alas!

2849
03:23:55,530 --> 03:23:56,510
It is my method.

2850
03:24:02,030 --> 03:24:03,070
Can I...

2851
03:24:04,410 --> 03:24:05,670
Oh, I need another one.

2852
03:24:10,010 --> 03:24:12,450
Giving me fallout, too.

2853
03:24:14,750 --> 03:24:16,570
Giving me half-life, too.

2854
03:24:19,870 --> 03:24:20,730
I don't know.

2855
03:24:20,850 --> 03:24:22,630
I don't know how to stand it up.

2856
03:24:23,950 --> 03:24:24,910
You can't.

2857
03:24:24,950 --> 03:24:26,830
You can't turn things.

2858
03:24:31,850 --> 03:24:32,330
Yeah.

2859
03:24:42,360 --> 03:24:43,740
Pick it up and look it up.

2860
03:24:43,960 --> 03:24:44,400
Look at it.

2861
03:24:44,520 --> 03:24:45,800
Oh, like...

2862
03:24:45,800 --> 03:24:46,880
Oh, no!

2863
03:24:47,800 --> 03:24:49,240
Oh, it really is like that.

2864
03:24:49,260 --> 03:24:50,820
Oh my gosh.

2865
03:24:53,540 --> 03:24:55,160
Wait, can I crouch jump this thing?

2866
03:24:58,180 --> 03:25:00,520
Who said this wasn't gonna work?

2867
03:25:07,380 --> 03:25:08,980
Who doubted my genius?

2868
03:25:19,380 --> 03:25:23,480
I actually don't know at all what the intended way is supposed to be, so...

2869
03:25:24,740 --> 03:25:25,700
I'm actually...

2870
03:25:25,700 --> 03:25:27,540
I'm actually... I have no idea.

2871
03:25:34,410 --> 03:25:36,510
One bowl of mint soup, please.

2872
03:25:37,170 --> 03:25:37,970
Mmm, soup.

2873
03:25:44,250 --> 03:25:45,070
Come on.

2874
03:25:45,830 --> 03:25:46,270
No.

2875
03:25:46,790 --> 03:25:47,750
No, come on.

2876
03:25:49,230 --> 03:25:50,090
No, come on.

2877
03:25:51,350 --> 03:25:51,910
Yeah, you.

2878
03:25:52,190 --> 03:25:52,370
Okay.

2879
03:25:58,950 --> 03:25:59,390
Ew.

2880
03:26:01,470 --> 03:26:01,910
Oopsie.

2881
03:26:02,130 --> 03:26:02,670
Oh, you're fine.

2882
03:26:02,850 --> 03:26:03,110
You're fine.

2883
03:26:03,270 --> 03:26:03,810
Everything is okay.

2884
03:26:04,150 --> 03:26:05,090
Don't worry about it.

2885
03:26:18,210 --> 03:26:19,550
I was safe!

2886
03:26:21,550 --> 03:26:22,090
Yippee!

2887
03:26:25,710 --> 03:26:27,410
Wait, F6, there we go.

2888
03:26:27,890 --> 03:26:28,310
I don't know why.

2889
03:26:29,870 --> 03:26:30,990
Press something else there.

2890
03:26:33,270 --> 03:26:36,150
So this turns on...

2891
03:26:37,910 --> 03:26:39,090
The Thumper.

2892
03:26:42,610 --> 03:26:44,190
I keep turning down the volume.

2893
03:26:44,310 --> 03:26:44,710
Sorry, guys.

2894
03:26:47,790 --> 03:26:50,570
Dumpin, dumpin, dumpin, we're dumpin, dumpin.

2895
03:26:50,770 --> 03:26:52,010
Oh, baby.

2896
03:26:55,950 --> 03:26:58,230
Does she know what dumpers do?

2897
03:26:58,950 --> 03:27:03,210
I know that they stop it so that the things can't touch you.

2898
03:27:03,630 --> 03:27:04,750
The guys don't come to you.

2899
03:27:05,410 --> 03:27:07,310
Do they have another intended purpose?

2900
03:27:10,310 --> 03:27:12,150
Dumpin, dumpin, dumpin, dumpin.

2901
03:27:12,150 --> 03:27:13,310
We're dumpin, dumpin.

2902
03:27:13,830 --> 03:27:14,970
They dump.

2903
03:27:17,430 --> 03:27:18,430
We're dumping.

2904
03:27:19,190 --> 03:27:19,350
Oops.

2905
03:27:20,070 --> 03:27:22,010
Don't, don't, don't, no, no, no.

2906
03:27:24,150 --> 03:27:24,750
The couch.

2907
03:27:25,570 --> 03:27:25,930
Chair.

2908
03:27:30,910 --> 03:27:33,790
Do you think there's a few videos exploiting physics bugs?

2909
03:27:34,630 --> 03:27:36,970
You can fly, skip the whole buggy section, for instance.

2910
03:27:39,730 --> 03:27:40,250
Um.

2911
03:27:45,500 --> 03:27:46,700
Wait a second.

2912
03:27:46,780 --> 03:27:47,960
There's gotta be something in here.

2913
03:27:48,100 --> 03:27:48,440
No.

2914
03:27:49,720 --> 03:27:50,240
Oh.

2915
03:27:50,240 --> 03:27:50,600
Whoa.

2916
03:27:52,940 --> 03:27:54,260
Yeah, baby.

2917
03:28:02,960 --> 03:28:05,100
There's got to be something else.

2918
03:28:55,150 --> 03:28:58,790
It switches to my crowbar instead of my guns.

2919
03:29:11,650 --> 03:29:13,210
That's one way to get over here.

2920
03:29:13,630 --> 03:29:14,070
I guess.

2921
03:29:18,890 --> 03:29:26,850
No, what I was saying is when I go for my gravity gun sometimes to my regular guns, it goes to crowbar instead of the gun.

2922
03:29:27,950 --> 03:29:31,870
Maybe I was using the crowbar last and I just forgot to switch it back.

2923
03:29:32,650 --> 03:29:33,430
Might have been me.

2924
03:29:33,770 --> 03:29:34,410
I don't know.

2925
03:29:35,350 --> 03:29:35,650
Ugh.

2926
03:29:41,650 --> 03:29:42,130
Okay.

2927
03:29:45,530 --> 03:29:47,170
I want to make it over there.

2928
03:29:49,330 --> 03:29:50,910
I don't think I can.

2929
03:29:51,570 --> 03:29:52,090
Oh, maybe.

2930
03:29:52,670 --> 03:29:54,390
I won't be able to make it back up.

2931
03:29:56,290 --> 03:29:56,650
Okay.

2932
03:29:58,530 --> 03:30:00,790
Q to toggle the last use weapon.

2933
03:30:01,830 --> 03:30:03,310
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

2934
03:30:03,690 --> 03:30:04,030
Thank you.

2935
03:30:05,210 --> 03:30:06,170
I forgot about Q.

2936
03:30:08,530 --> 03:30:10,810
I press G to go to the gravity gun.

2937
03:30:11,030 --> 03:30:11,810
I don't think you can...

2938
03:30:11,810 --> 03:30:13,670
Can you go to the gravity gun in other ways?

2939
03:30:14,330 --> 03:30:15,210
Oh, you can.

2940
03:30:15,450 --> 03:30:16,730
No, I always press G.

2941
03:30:18,750 --> 03:30:19,230
Yeah.

2942
03:30:26,670 --> 03:30:33,450
I like how people are like, yeah, you can press G and then also switch weapons with the numbers.

2943
03:30:34,850 --> 03:30:38,730
As if I'm not like so many hours into this game.

2944
03:30:38,930 --> 03:30:39,990
Though I did forget about Q.

2945
03:30:40,170 --> 03:30:41,110
I'll admit that.

2946
03:30:43,250 --> 03:30:43,590
Wait!

2947
03:30:44,010 --> 03:30:45,070
I can run to the thumper.

2948
03:30:45,230 --> 03:30:46,030
I completely forgot.

2949
03:30:53,470 --> 03:30:53,950
Stupid.

2950
03:30:56,370 --> 03:30:59,250
I did all this hard work to get the thumper working.

2951
03:31:02,010 --> 03:31:02,490
Wait.

2952
03:31:02,710 --> 03:31:03,110
Not that.

2953
03:31:03,270 --> 03:31:04,070
This one.

2954
03:31:08,440 --> 03:31:08,720
Oh.

2955
03:31:10,260 --> 03:31:11,000
Oh no.

2956
03:31:11,140 --> 03:31:12,240
Oh yes, yes, yes!

2957
03:31:12,760 --> 03:31:13,140
Yes!

2958
03:31:14,180 --> 03:31:14,840
Oh.

2959
03:31:15,540 --> 03:31:16,600
Where did you come from?

2960
03:31:24,890 --> 03:31:25,550
Wait.

2961
03:31:27,290 --> 03:31:27,890
Uh.

2962
03:31:28,950 --> 03:31:29,610
Does

2963
03:31:40,580 --> 03:31:41,880
that count as grass?

2964
03:31:43,180 --> 03:31:43,840
Or sand?

2965
03:31:45,100 --> 03:31:46,640
He's like, that's that's that.

2966
03:31:47,120 --> 03:31:51,060
And I have to blast your way through here.

2967
03:31:51,420 --> 03:31:52,760
Yeah, I definitely think that.

2968
03:31:53,380 --> 03:31:54,660
That is still sand.

2969
03:32:02,130 --> 03:32:03,510
That was kind of silly.

2970
03:32:05,630 --> 03:32:07,010
I'm trying to decide.

2971
03:32:07,110 --> 03:32:07,710
You know what?

2972
03:32:09,390 --> 03:32:11,870
Well, more are just going to come out, so whatever.

2973
03:32:21,790 --> 03:32:22,130
Oh!

2974
03:32:24,370 --> 03:32:25,630
They left me alone.

2975
03:32:32,220 --> 03:32:33,380
Oh my god.

2976
03:32:34,700 --> 03:32:35,320
So close.

2977
03:32:39,950 --> 03:32:41,890
Oh my god, it keeps going!

2978
03:32:44,150 --> 03:32:44,650
More!

2979
03:32:47,830 --> 03:32:49,030
There's more!

2980
03:32:49,150 --> 03:32:50,550
Do I just run through here?

2981
03:32:50,710 --> 03:32:52,830
There has to be that.

2982
03:32:57,400 --> 03:32:57,760
Bitch.

2983
03:32:59,380 --> 03:33:00,080
Go away.

2984
03:33:16,110 --> 03:33:17,530
I want the supplies.

2985
03:33:17,990 --> 03:33:19,930
Well, I have enough health, maybe.

2986
03:33:20,990 --> 03:33:21,330
What the?

2987
03:33:22,430 --> 03:33:23,330
Oh, my God.

2988
03:33:24,190 --> 03:33:24,770
Wait, what are you?

2989
03:33:25,610 --> 03:33:26,750
Oh, you're a boss.

2990
03:33:30,190 --> 03:33:31,230
Oh, gosh.

2991
03:33:41,670 --> 03:33:42,550
This is fucked up.

2992
03:33:43,330 --> 03:33:44,410
This is fucked up.

2993
03:33:44,450 --> 03:33:45,030
This is fucked up.

2994
03:33:47,150 --> 03:33:48,110
Oh my god.

2995
03:33:53,850 --> 03:33:57,010
I'm trying to use the explosives, but they're...

2996
03:33:57,010 --> 03:33:57,390
Ow!

2997
03:33:57,570 --> 03:33:58,290
They're far!

2998
03:33:58,550 --> 03:33:59,470
Oh my gosh.

2999
03:34:00,110 --> 03:34:00,390
Wait.

3000
03:34:01,150 --> 03:34:01,750
Hold on, come here.

3001
03:34:06,410 --> 03:34:06,930
And...

3002
03:34:06,930 --> 03:34:09,130
Oh, I was way too...

3003
03:34:09,130 --> 03:34:09,890
Way too close.

3004
03:34:11,590 --> 03:34:12,570
Oh my gosh.

3005
03:34:12,710 --> 03:34:12,870
What?

3006
03:34:15,690 --> 03:34:16,850
Oh, my friends!

3007
03:34:17,410 --> 03:34:18,310
My friends are here, too.

3008
03:34:25,080 --> 03:34:26,780
Uh, are they hitting me too?

3009
03:34:29,260 --> 03:34:30,420
I'm almost out of bullets.

3010
03:34:31,560 --> 03:34:32,700
Uh, let's try...

3011
03:34:32,700 --> 03:34:33,440
Not the crossbow.

3012
03:34:34,860 --> 03:34:35,520
Let's try...

3013
03:34:35,520 --> 03:34:35,760
Oh, wait.

3014
03:34:35,860 --> 03:34:38,140
I have, um...

3015
03:34:41,990 --> 03:34:42,450
Oops.

3016
03:34:42,610 --> 03:34:42,970
I'm out.

3017
03:34:48,890 --> 03:34:50,830
Wait, what about this guy?

3018
03:34:56,580 --> 03:34:57,020
Thank you.

3019
03:34:58,700 --> 03:34:59,160
Okay.

3020
03:35:05,620 --> 03:35:06,260
Ah!

3021
03:35:06,760 --> 03:35:07,580
Oh my god.

3022
03:35:09,360 --> 03:35:10,800
The freeman must follow.

3023
03:35:12,760 --> 03:35:14,840
Don't scare me like that.

3024
03:35:16,760 --> 03:35:17,460
Oh my...

3025
03:35:17,460 --> 03:35:21,660
The freeman will do wise to heed our expression of the Mermadog's aromatic pheropods.

3026
03:35:22,140 --> 03:35:26,420
The process is not entirely hygienic, therefore stand aside.

3027
03:35:32,620 --> 03:35:35,720
The freeman will have needs of these pheropods on the paths ahead.

3028
03:35:35,940 --> 03:35:36,320
Oh really?

3029
03:35:36,380 --> 03:35:37,140
Gather them now.

3030
03:35:37,480 --> 03:35:37,700
Okay.

3031
03:35:39,520 --> 03:35:40,320
Okay.

3032
03:35:42,160 --> 03:35:43,760
Hold on.

3033
03:35:43,960 --> 03:35:45,100
One moment, please.

3034
03:35:52,030 --> 03:35:53,710
There's no more guys in here, right?

3035
03:36:03,830 --> 03:36:05,050
Good for now.

3036
03:36:06,610 --> 03:36:09,650
I saw one more.

3037
03:36:13,070 --> 03:36:13,990
By the door.

3038
03:36:14,710 --> 03:36:14,950
Yeah.

3039
03:36:16,790 --> 03:36:17,150
Oh.

3040
03:36:18,190 --> 03:36:19,270
Thank you.

3041
03:36:20,170 --> 03:36:20,690
Look at him.

3042
03:36:20,690 --> 03:36:20,890
go.

3043
03:36:21,070 --> 03:36:21,750
He's so cute.

3044
03:36:22,230 --> 03:36:24,310
Even though he scared the heck out of me.

3045
03:36:30,210 --> 03:36:32,210
Oh, I guess I really didn't, you know.

3046
03:36:32,690 --> 03:36:32,930
Hi.

3047
03:36:33,390 --> 03:36:35,350
Thank you.

3048
03:36:36,930 --> 03:36:38,930
Yeah, that was pretty freaky.

3049
03:36:39,150 --> 03:36:39,830
I didn't like it.

3050
03:36:48,980 --> 03:36:50,360
Nah, I don't care.

3051
03:36:56,540 --> 03:37:00,020
They're probably talking about how much they want, how much they want me, you know?

3052
03:37:08,670 --> 03:37:09,710
Good morning.

3053
03:37:10,470 --> 03:37:11,250
Oh, are you alright?

3054
03:37:12,990 --> 03:37:14,030
Good morning.

3055
03:37:24,010 --> 03:37:25,410
Freaky music in here, huh?

3056
03:37:27,590 --> 03:37:28,930
They're trash talking, man?

3057
03:37:31,530 --> 03:37:33,930
You know, they're trash talking me?

3058
03:37:35,130 --> 03:37:36,730
Then they're cowards.

3059
03:37:36,870 --> 03:37:37,970
They could just say it to my face.

3060
03:37:38,070 --> 03:37:38,110
Hey, my doctor, Freeman.

3061
03:37:38,590 --> 03:37:39,910
No prospect is just ahead.

3062
03:37:40,610 --> 03:37:43,030
One man alone wouldn't stand much chance going in there.

3063
03:37:43,430 --> 03:37:46,670
But a man with a pack of ant lines, well, that's a different story.

3064
03:37:46,790 --> 03:37:47,530
What do you mean by that?

3065
03:37:48,050 --> 03:37:50,050
Because of the thing I have.

3066
03:37:51,090 --> 03:37:51,410
Whoa.

3067
03:37:52,510 --> 03:37:54,050
I'm going to control them.

3068
03:37:54,250 --> 03:37:56,710
The Freeman honors us by his presence.

3069
03:37:57,570 --> 03:37:58,030
Follow Freeman.

3070
03:38:09,190 --> 03:38:10,150
I'm following?

3071
03:38:15,030 --> 03:38:15,770
The Freeman of the Force?

3072
03:38:15,790 --> 03:38:18,610
The free man will now be instructed in the use of pheromones.

3073
03:38:18,850 --> 03:38:19,510
Oh, I heard.

3074
03:38:20,310 --> 03:38:24,710
I learned to shepherd ant lions with the so-called bug bait.

3075
03:38:27,530 --> 03:38:32,510
The free man will now break out his venom pod and toss one into yonder pit.

3076
03:38:33,170 --> 03:38:35,290
The free man has done well.

3077
03:38:35,710 --> 03:38:36,270
Thank you.

3078
03:38:37,710 --> 03:38:38,270
End?

3079
03:38:39,770 --> 03:38:41,650
Oh, you're pushing me?

3080
03:38:42,330 --> 03:38:46,730
The free man can also coach his ant lions to attack specific targets.

3081
03:38:47,510 --> 03:38:50,170
Oh, it's like the things from before.

3082
03:38:51,610 --> 03:38:53,070
The little guys that I would throw.

3083
03:39:01,310 --> 03:39:02,770
The snarks, yes.

3084
03:39:03,010 --> 03:39:04,330
But do they turn on me now?

3085
03:39:05,550 --> 03:39:06,530
No, they don't.

3086
03:39:06,850 --> 03:39:07,610
They love me.

3087
03:39:07,770 --> 03:39:08,290
Come

3088
03:39:13,020 --> 03:39:15,160
here.

3089
03:39:19,970 --> 03:39:20,950
They love me.

3090
03:39:21,070 --> 03:39:21,650
They love me.

3091
03:39:21,790 --> 03:39:22,790
They become your Pokemon.

3092
03:39:24,890 --> 03:39:52,110
to signal the outlines in your command to follow you come here baby shows his excellence in all things why don't you guys compliment me like that remember well what you have learned here the elite advance has greatest confidence in you thank you oh

3093
03:39:56,270 --> 03:39:57,610
Let's go, babies.

3094
03:40:02,000 --> 03:40:04,360
The streamer excels in all things.

3095
03:40:06,980 --> 03:40:08,360
They love me.

3096
03:40:08,520 --> 03:40:09,760
They love me.

3097
03:40:24,130 --> 03:40:24,870
Yeah, yeah.

3098
03:40:25,370 --> 03:40:27,410
Oh, so I just throw and I get to gather more.

3099
03:40:29,330 --> 03:40:30,390
Follow, follow.

3100
03:40:38,460 --> 03:40:40,300
The Minto has an exquisite storm.

3101
03:40:41,980 --> 03:40:43,500
Dangerous, make you smell.

3102
03:40:47,880 --> 03:40:49,940
Oh no, I gotta turn that off!

3103
03:40:56,360 --> 03:40:57,100
I can't go near...

3104
03:40:57,100 --> 03:40:59,200
Now the thumpers are not our friends.

3105
03:40:59,800 --> 03:41:00,780
You guys go right there.

3106
03:41:04,720 --> 03:41:05,880
What happens if they get close?

3107
03:41:18,310 --> 03:41:18,750
Uh-oh.

3108
03:41:18,790 --> 03:41:19,950
Priority warning.

3109
03:41:20,550 --> 03:41:22,430
Outlast stabilization force.

3110
03:41:22,810 --> 03:41:23,890
Six noble cross-task.

3111
03:41:24,890 --> 03:41:26,170
Perimeter restricted.

3112
03:41:26,370 --> 03:41:26,810
Disengage.

3113
03:41:26,950 --> 03:41:27,150
Okay.

3114
03:41:27,490 --> 03:41:28,250
Follow, friends.

3115
03:41:28,610 --> 03:41:29,110
Priority warning.

3116
03:41:29,810 --> 03:41:30,730
Perimeter restricted.

3117
03:41:31,810 --> 03:41:33,290
They just find it unpleasant.

3118
03:41:33,490 --> 03:41:36,290
Oh, okay, so I don't have to, like, keep them away from it, right?

3119
03:41:36,510 --> 03:41:36,630
Okay.

3120
03:41:37,930 --> 03:41:38,710
What a strange...

3121
03:41:38,710 --> 03:41:42,870
How did they discover that, like, that the thumpers worked like this?

3122
03:41:43,510 --> 03:41:43,910
You know?

3123
03:41:47,050 --> 03:41:48,390
I have a question, though.

3124
03:41:48,470 --> 03:41:50,750
If I stop holding this, will they turn on me?

3125
03:42:02,570 --> 03:42:05,670
Oh, they won't?

3126
03:42:05,770 --> 03:42:06,610
They still love me?

3127
03:42:06,630 --> 03:42:08,110
Oh, they still love me?

3128
03:42:10,490 --> 03:42:11,390
I need you, baby.

3129
03:42:29,880 --> 03:42:31,000
Holy cow.

3130
03:42:31,800 --> 03:42:32,320
Good job.

3131
03:42:32,540 --> 03:42:32,720
Wait.

3132
03:42:33,960 --> 03:42:34,700
Did we lose some?

3133
03:42:37,220 --> 03:42:38,340
Can I get more?

3134
03:42:39,900 --> 03:42:40,460
I love Ebers.

3135
03:42:48,780 --> 03:42:49,900
They respawn.

3136
03:42:50,180 --> 03:42:50,720
Let's go.

3137
03:42:51,940 --> 03:42:53,440
And they love me now.

3138
03:42:56,740 --> 03:42:57,320
What is this?

3139
03:42:59,560 --> 03:43:00,920
We did lose one!

3140
03:43:01,060 --> 03:43:01,420
No!

3141
03:43:09,940 --> 03:43:11,660
Uh, six, I have to remember this.

3142
03:43:15,820 --> 03:43:17,440
What they respawned, they do?

3143
03:43:23,660 --> 03:43:24,560
Bugs are infinite.

3144
03:43:25,240 --> 03:43:27,740
What's the bad side of using these guys then?

3145
03:43:30,640 --> 03:43:31,120
Oop!

3146
03:43:43,890 --> 03:43:46,250
I think we just lost our whole team.

3147
03:43:53,750 --> 03:43:54,850
It's kind of awesome.

3148
03:43:58,890 --> 03:44:01,770
And then if I queue, let's do a queue as a...

3149
03:44:02,690 --> 03:44:04,550
We'll do our, whoops, a shotgun.

3150
03:44:07,010 --> 03:44:08,650
And then, shotgun.

3151
03:44:11,270 --> 03:44:11,850
Where, okay.

3152
03:44:12,190 --> 03:44:13,810
Just wanted to make sure that I had it.

3153
03:44:13,950 --> 03:44:14,370
All good.

3154
03:44:20,280 --> 03:44:21,880
I didn't even notice that that was a thing.

3155
03:44:22,080 --> 03:44:22,440
Okay, cool.

3156
03:44:26,170 --> 03:44:27,810
I don't know what I just shut off, but.

3157
03:44:28,450 --> 03:44:28,590
Yeah!

3158
03:44:28,770 --> 03:44:28,890
Oh.

3159
03:44:30,910 --> 03:44:31,330
Where?

3160
03:44:32,510 --> 03:44:34,010
How, who dares shoot?

3161
03:44:35,230 --> 03:44:36,310
Descend my army!

3162
03:44:37,390 --> 03:44:37,810
Okay.

3163
03:44:39,290 --> 03:44:41,650
Where are they shooting at?

3164
03:44:44,050 --> 03:44:45,510
Where'd they come from?

3165
03:44:51,600 --> 03:44:51,800
Hmm.

3166
03:44:52,580 --> 03:44:53,380
Are you okay, my babies?

3167
03:44:56,720 --> 03:44:57,880
We're okay, babies?

3168
03:45:00,640 --> 03:45:01,340
Doesn't matter.

3169
03:45:01,480 --> 03:45:02,060
They're dead now.

3170
03:45:02,380 --> 03:45:03,380
Yeah, pretty much.

3171
03:45:04,940 --> 03:45:10,910
I don't know what I turned off in there, but...

3172
03:45:12,350 --> 03:45:13,250
It's okay.

3173
03:45:13,730 --> 03:45:14,050
Shh.

3174
03:45:14,850 --> 03:45:15,650
I will.

3175
03:45:15,670 --> 03:45:16,590
protect you.

3176
03:45:18,150 --> 03:45:19,010
My babies.

3177
03:45:27,070 --> 03:45:29,170
It can be off of this thing!

3178
03:45:33,070 --> 03:45:37,330
How much more of this chapter do I have?

3179
03:45:38,650 --> 03:45:38,690
Ah!

3180
03:45:43,360 --> 03:45:44,060
Mother.

3181
03:45:47,380 --> 03:45:48,820
A bit?

3182
03:45:48,980 --> 03:45:49,220
Okay.

3183
03:45:51,100 --> 03:45:55,200
wait did we start a new chapter let's

3184
03:46:00,890 --> 03:46:29,090

3185
03:46:33,620 --> 03:46:34,120
Stop!

3186
03:46:41,340 --> 03:46:42,440
Can I even get this going?

3187
03:46:45,160 --> 03:46:46,160
I'm confused.

3188
03:46:59,410 --> 03:47:00,610
I don't think the grenade...

3189
03:47:00,610 --> 03:47:01,710
Will the grenade work, actually?

3190
03:47:05,850 --> 03:47:06,350
Uh...

3191
03:47:07,190 --> 03:47:08,630
It bounces off.

3192
03:47:09,530 --> 03:47:10,490
What's this over here?

3193
03:47:10,650 --> 03:47:10,970
Hold on.

3194
03:47:11,890 --> 03:47:12,890
I might die again.

3195
03:47:13,250 --> 03:47:13,810
I'm about to die.

3196
03:47:14,830 --> 03:47:15,250
Eh?

3197
03:47:24,950 --> 03:47:26,030
Go my children!

3198
03:47:27,090 --> 03:47:28,030
Oh, we lost one.

3199
03:47:28,150 --> 03:47:29,010
It's so sad to see.

3200
03:47:33,030 --> 03:47:33,370
Oh!

3201
03:47:37,850 --> 03:47:39,190
Go my children, go!

3202
03:47:40,390 --> 03:47:40,890
Ouch.

3203
03:47:41,570 --> 03:47:43,510
Who keeps sending those?

3204
03:47:45,070 --> 03:47:47,790
I don't even see when they throw them at me.

3205
03:47:49,690 --> 03:47:50,390
Oh my god, finally.

3206
03:47:50,670 --> 03:47:50,830
Okay.

3207
03:47:51,770 --> 03:47:53,470
Run to the next rock!

3208
03:47:57,370 --> 03:48:00,310
Uh, babies, this is not looking so good.

3209
03:48:00,430 --> 03:48:01,830
Oh my god, he's drowning!

3210
03:48:04,090 --> 03:48:05,370
It was fun just on my...

3211
03:48:05,370 --> 03:48:06,870
Oh, my bad face!

3212
03:48:08,330 --> 03:48:08,770
Run!

3213
03:48:09,230 --> 03:48:09,590
Somewhere!

3214
03:48:13,270 --> 03:48:13,930
Oh my gosh.

3215
03:48:14,930 --> 03:48:15,230
Ah!

3216
03:48:15,510 --> 03:48:16,550
Why would you throw that?

3217
03:48:16,630 --> 03:48:17,230
You stupid!

3218
03:48:19,190 --> 03:48:22,110
I really need to use my gun, but it's hard to switch between.

3219
03:48:34,530 --> 03:48:35,890
Come, my bad boys, come!

3220
03:48:36,770 --> 03:48:37,370
Come to me!

3221
03:48:38,610 --> 03:48:39,490
I'm here!

3222
03:48:43,050 --> 03:48:43,450
Yes.

3223
03:48:50,860 --> 03:48:51,300
Um...

3224
03:48:51,300 --> 03:48:52,980
There's a lot going on over here.

3225
03:48:53,260 --> 03:48:53,860
I'm gonna save.

3226
03:48:54,220 --> 03:48:55,380
Oh, that probably wasn't smart.

3227
03:48:55,520 --> 03:48:55,780
You know what?

3228
03:48:55,820 --> 03:48:56,180
That's fine.

3229
03:48:59,180 --> 03:49:00,400
Because I have low health.

3230
03:49:00,600 --> 03:49:01,000
But that's okay.

3231
03:49:02,120 --> 03:49:02,560
Uh...

3232
03:49:03,020 --> 03:49:04,700
What if I...

3233
03:49:08,430 --> 03:49:10,030
I don't know, that didn't reach though.

3234
03:49:11,510 --> 03:49:11,870
No!

3235
03:49:12,030 --> 03:49:12,670
My babies!

3236
03:49:15,910 --> 03:49:17,090
I have no idea.

3237
03:49:19,030 --> 03:49:21,910
It's really messed up that they are able to...

3238
03:49:22,690 --> 03:49:24,370
to shoot me from below.

3239
03:49:26,970 --> 03:49:28,310
This isn't the way!

3240
03:49:29,090 --> 03:49:29,570
Uh oh.

3241
03:49:31,190 --> 03:49:32,610
Where am I supposed to go then?

3242
03:49:33,250 --> 03:49:35,610
And why is that guy just shooting non-stop?

3243
03:49:37,170 --> 03:49:38,050
Is he bugged?

3244
03:49:43,720 --> 03:49:45,080
Oh, I see!

3245
03:49:45,220 --> 03:49:45,800
Up there!

3246
03:49:46,000 --> 03:49:47,140
I see up there, I see.

3247
03:49:54,600 --> 03:49:54,960
Okay.

3248
03:49:55,960 --> 03:49:57,560
I'm waiting for my power to...

3249
03:49:57,560 --> 03:49:57,740
Okay.

3250
03:50:20,750 --> 03:50:21,290
Yeah!

3251
03:50:21,770 --> 03:50:22,490
There we go.

3252
03:50:23,430 --> 03:50:23,770
Yeah!

3253
03:50:24,530 --> 03:50:25,570
Good job, babies.

3254
03:50:26,370 --> 03:50:27,370
Good job, babies.

3255
03:50:31,190 --> 03:50:31,730
Payback.

3256
03:50:32,690 --> 03:50:33,110
All right.

3257
03:50:33,470 --> 03:50:34,410
We're back in business.

3258
03:50:34,690 --> 03:50:37,470
Thank you guys for letting me know that that was not the right one.

3259
03:50:45,570 --> 03:50:47,130
I like babies.

3260
03:50:47,930 --> 03:50:48,590
A little pit.

3261
03:50:52,630 --> 03:50:55,610
Oh, we revel in the pit.

3262
03:51:04,780 --> 03:51:05,620
Why are you throwing flares?

3263
03:51:10,360 --> 03:51:11,780
Oh no, it's this thing again.

3264
03:51:16,490 --> 03:51:18,190
I forgot these things existed.

3265
03:51:30,890 --> 03:51:32,070
But now you have a gravity gun.

3266
03:51:35,900 --> 03:51:36,560
So true.

3267
03:51:38,060 --> 03:51:38,960
Hello, babies.

3268
03:51:40,320 --> 03:51:41,360
I need to get through.

3269
03:51:42,580 --> 03:51:43,240
Sort of block.

3270
03:51:54,680 --> 03:51:55,160
Oh

3271
03:51:59,020 --> 03:52:00,580
my god, I'm sorry, baby!

3272
03:52:07,990 --> 03:52:08,630
My burpers!

3273
03:52:17,550 --> 03:52:18,590
Good job, babies.

3274
03:52:20,190 --> 03:52:20,590
Good job.

3275
03:52:21,330 --> 03:52:22,130
Oh my gosh.

3276
03:52:22,590 --> 03:52:23,210
More babies.

3277
03:52:23,690 --> 03:52:24,390
I mean, more people.

3278
03:52:25,670 --> 03:52:26,950
I wish I had more babies.

3279
03:52:29,250 --> 03:52:30,670
Actually, why am I using this gun?

3280
03:52:30,750 --> 03:52:30,990
Sorry.

3281
03:52:31,390 --> 03:52:32,530
That would be, like, closer to them.

3282
03:52:37,090 --> 03:52:39,750
Use the anti-liance to kill 50 enemies, nice.

3283
03:52:41,530 --> 03:52:42,590
Did I hit you on accident?

3284
03:52:42,770 --> 03:52:43,410
I'm sorry, baby.

3285
03:52:51,860 --> 03:52:52,780
One moment, babies.

3286
03:52:55,920 --> 03:52:57,660
I love all my children.

3287
03:52:58,760 --> 03:52:59,200
Equally.

3288
03:53:06,390 --> 03:53:06,870
Explosives.

3289
03:53:07,110 --> 03:53:07,490
Be careful.

3290
03:53:08,590 --> 03:53:09,230
Be careful, babies.

3291
03:53:18,140 --> 03:53:18,980
Oh, what's in here?

3292
03:53:19,360 --> 03:53:19,820
One moment.

3293
03:53:23,040 --> 03:53:25,260
Oh, if I go in here, I can't get out.

3294
03:53:25,780 --> 03:53:26,120
Okay, yeah.

3295
03:53:27,060 --> 03:53:28,100
It's like, wait a second.

3296
03:53:28,280 --> 03:53:30,220
Oh my gosh, another place to get the crossbow?

3297
03:53:34,560 --> 03:53:34,940
Okay.

3298
03:53:37,840 --> 03:53:38,900
Good job, babies.

3299
03:53:40,440 --> 03:53:42,160
Oh my god!

3300
03:53:42,300 --> 03:53:43,440
These are Mike Tyson's ass.

3301
03:53:43,500 --> 03:53:45,060
Thank you so much for the redirect.

3302
03:53:45,440 --> 03:53:46,000
Thank you!

3303
03:53:47,480 --> 03:53:48,460
Thank you, thank you!

3304
03:53:50,680 --> 03:53:51,280
400.

3305
03:54:24,830 --> 03:54:26,550
Actually, I wonder...

3306
03:54:27,410 --> 03:54:27,990
Crossbow.

3307
03:54:32,630 --> 03:54:32,830
Oh!

3308
03:54:33,330 --> 03:54:33,390

3309
03:54:33,450 --> 03:54:34,050
Oh!

3310
03:54:34,790 --> 03:54:35,390
Oh!

3311
03:54:35,390 --> 03:54:35,410
Oh!

3312
03:54:35,410 --> 03:54:35,490
Oh!

3313
03:54:35,490 --> 03:54:36,210
Oh, you have...

3314
03:54:36,210 --> 03:54:36,770
I don't know.

3315
03:54:40,910 --> 03:54:42,690
Oh, you scared me, babies.

3316
03:54:43,590 --> 03:54:44,670

03:54:44,790 --> 03:54:54,730

3319
03:55:19,810 --> 03:55:20,930
What's this?

3320
03:55:21,270 --> 03:55:22,070
Ear protection.

3321
03:55:22,930 --> 03:55:23,530
That's smart.

3322
03:55:27,710 --> 03:55:28,670
Look how they purr!

3323
03:55:28,810 --> 03:55:30,030
They're so cute!

3324
03:55:30,950 --> 03:55:33,130
I'm obsessed with them now.

3325
03:55:40,960 --> 03:55:42,200
This prison's crazy.

3326
03:55:42,640 --> 03:55:44,160
Oh, okay.

3327
03:55:45,440 --> 03:55:45,660
Oops.

3328
03:55:46,980 --> 03:55:47,960
I'm insane.

3329
03:55:51,680 --> 03:55:52,900
Oh, damn.

3330
03:55:53,040 --> 03:55:56,000
That was way too... Actually, Let's go with...

3331
03:55:56,000 --> 03:55:56,340
You.

3332
03:56:01,040 --> 03:56:01,920
Go, my babies!

3333
03:56:15,920 --> 03:56:16,520
Oh my gosh.

3334
03:56:17,940 --> 03:56:18,740
Wait, you.

3335
03:56:19,820 --> 03:56:20,060
Woo!

3336
03:56:21,820 --> 03:56:24,000
Can I use this to destroy...

3337
03:56:28,940 --> 03:56:31,800
Not just them, but also the...

3338
03:56:31,800 --> 03:56:33,020
The plane.

3339
03:56:36,100 --> 03:56:36,660
Um...

3340
03:56:38,180 --> 03:56:39,180
Where'd the plane go?

3341
03:56:41,080 --> 03:56:42,100
Just kidding.

3342
03:56:43,640 --> 03:56:44,520
Wasn't that important.

3343
03:56:47,180 --> 03:56:47,860
Okay.

3344
03:56:49,800 --> 03:56:50,420
Dropship.

3345
03:56:53,240 --> 03:56:53,900
Technically, yes.

3346
03:56:54,560 --> 03:56:55,480
That'd be crazy.

3347
03:56:55,860 --> 03:56:57,180
Hold on, I'm picking up supplies.

3348
03:56:59,680 --> 03:57:02,520
I don't remember where I killed anybody, though.

3349
03:57:03,920 --> 03:57:04,340
Aha!

3350
03:57:05,640 --> 03:57:06,700
Very good.

3351
03:57:08,440 --> 03:57:09,460
Oh, oh my gosh.

3352
03:57:09,600 --> 03:57:10,540
There's so many.

3353
03:57:10,560 --> 03:57:23,940
weapons now it's hard for me to keep track of all the of all the numbers at this point that's why i'm always flipping through them because i'm like oh which one was who is who is

3354
03:57:27,230 --> 03:57:40,610
who's the ghost that's got the stream that's made for you and me oh m-i-n-k-m-y-t-o-a oh wait wait Thank you.

3355
03:57:48,310 --> 03:57:48,490
Oh.

3356
03:57:54,370 --> 03:57:54,990
Uh-oh.

3357
03:57:56,030 --> 03:57:57,170
I didn't make it.

3358
03:58:04,220 --> 03:58:05,000
What letter?

3359
03:58:05,100 --> 03:58:05,920
I was trying...

3360
03:58:05,920 --> 03:58:06,520
Wait, where am I?

3361
03:58:06,520 --> 03:58:08,300
I was trying to spell ghost.

3362
03:58:10,580 --> 03:58:11,600
Oh, wait a second.

3363
03:58:11,860 --> 03:58:13,060
There's a ladder there.

3364
03:58:13,200 --> 03:58:14,340
Gamers don't look up.

3365
03:58:14,980 --> 03:58:16,540
But then over here...

3366
03:58:20,020 --> 03:58:20,820
There is.

3367
03:58:21,740 --> 03:58:23,160
Oh, wait, I can go from here.

3368
03:58:25,560 --> 03:58:25,960
Yes.

3369
03:58:29,540 --> 03:58:31,200
Oh, no, I was gonna say some...

3370
03:58:31,200 --> 03:58:31,540
Uh-oh.

3371
03:58:35,700 --> 03:58:38,940
I was gonna say there's friends, but there's definitely not.

3372
03:58:39,040 --> 03:58:40,760
Oh, I could have set them on fire, but whatever.

3373
03:58:41,180 --> 03:58:42,300
Everyone made it, right?

3374
03:58:42,620 --> 03:58:43,900
Why are there only two of you?

3375
03:58:44,220 --> 03:58:46,240
Where are your brothers and sisters?

3376
03:58:47,420 --> 03:58:48,040
Oh, shoot.

3377
03:58:48,120 --> 03:58:48,880
There's nothing here.

3378
03:58:49,340 --> 03:58:49,980
Oh, yes, there is.

3379
03:58:53,540 --> 03:58:55,200
Lift me up, babies.

3380
03:58:57,080 --> 03:58:57,880
Raise me up.

3381
03:58:58,560 --> 03:58:58,820
Babies?

3382
03:58:59,620 --> 03:59:00,380
Babies.

3383
03:59:00,900 --> 03:59:01,440
Raise me up.

3384
03:59:08,110 --> 03:59:08,590
Dang.

3385
03:59:18,660 --> 03:59:21,080
It's a gravity gun puzzle.

3386
03:59:22,880 --> 03:59:26,960
It looks like the alien they found in...

3387
03:59:27,580 --> 03:59:29,740
in, uh...

3388
03:59:29,740 --> 03:59:31,380
In Mexico.

3389
03:59:33,220 --> 03:59:35,940
The crowbar.

3390
03:59:39,820 --> 03:59:42,280
What do I need the crowbar here for?

3391
03:59:45,200 --> 03:59:46,220
My babies are burning?

3392
03:59:46,820 --> 03:59:48,700
That's not what's happening, is it?

3393
03:59:55,500 --> 03:59:57,840
Look, he's just warm in his bum by the fire.

3394
04:00:00,180 --> 04:00:01,060
Puzzle time.

3395
04:00:07,390 --> 04:00:08,270
Hmm, swoop.

3396
04:00:08,730 --> 04:00:10,690
Do I make a, like a...

3397
04:00:10,690 --> 04:00:11,670
What's it called with this?

3398
04:00:18,550 --> 04:00:19,350
Move, please.

3399
04:00:19,970 --> 04:00:21,290
Mommy's working.

3400
04:00:34,360 --> 04:00:35,220
Ouch!

3401
04:00:40,040 --> 04:00:41,310
Oh, wait a second.

3402
04:00:44,590 --> 04:00:45,590
Oh, wait a second.

3403
04:00:48,920 --> 04:00:50,430
We got it.

3404
04:00:59,730 --> 04:01:00,590
Um...

3405
04:01:00,590 --> 04:01:01,810
Where could they be?

3406
04:01:03,750 --> 04:01:05,370
Dropped wood on the baby.

3407
04:01:07,430 --> 04:01:08,610
They didn't mind.

3408
04:01:08,870 --> 04:01:08,910
Oh.

3409
04:01:16,320 --> 04:01:17,460
Where are you?

3410
04:01:18,040 --> 04:01:18,700
There you are.

3411
04:01:20,040 --> 04:01:20,880
I got him.

3412
04:01:30,450 --> 04:01:31,710
We got him.

3413
04:01:32,090 --> 04:01:33,090
I'm almost out of...

3414
04:01:33,090 --> 04:01:34,030
This is purring.

3415
04:01:34,590 --> 04:01:36,090
Almost out of ammo for this thing, Norm.

3416
04:01:36,570 --> 04:01:36,930
Sad.

3417
04:01:37,670 --> 04:01:39,290
We'll just switch to the regular SMG.

3418
04:01:43,380 --> 04:01:43,920
And look at that.

3419
04:01:43,980 --> 04:01:44,660
We're back here.

3420
04:01:48,510 --> 04:01:49,470
Take their stuff.

3421
04:01:49,890 --> 04:01:52,930
Oh, look at you, smart guy.

3422
04:01:55,710 --> 04:01:56,270
Nice!

3423
04:01:58,510 --> 04:01:59,570
Oh, there's more over here.

3424
04:02:00,890 --> 04:02:01,990
Where are you guys going?

3425
04:02:02,990 --> 04:02:04,410
Wait, can I go over there?

3426
04:02:05,490 --> 04:02:06,350
Oh, here guys.

3427
04:02:08,670 --> 04:02:09,230
Uh...

3428
04:02:11,530 --> 04:02:13,910
Nah, they're like, we found you, help mom!

3429
04:02:15,310 --> 04:02:15,510
Ha!

3430
04:02:16,170 --> 04:02:16,730
Yes.

3431
04:02:18,310 --> 04:02:18,870
Brrrr.

3432
04:02:22,530 --> 04:02:23,470
What's happening?

3433
04:02:24,490 --> 04:02:25,050
What?

3434
04:02:25,130 --> 04:02:26,130
What was that noise?

3435
04:02:28,390 --> 04:02:29,110
Oh my gosh.

3436
04:02:29,790 --> 04:02:31,090
They're so loud sometimes.

3437
04:02:35,990 --> 04:02:36,450
They're going?

3438
04:02:37,690 --> 04:02:38,170
They are...

3439
04:02:38,670 --> 04:02:38,830
Oh!

3440
04:02:46,650 --> 04:02:47,510
Hello baby.

3441
04:02:49,450 --> 04:02:51,010
Do I need to go in here or...

3442
04:02:51,770 --> 04:02:53,670
Let's retreat real quick.

3443
04:02:56,850 --> 04:02:59,730
They started going after my guys so fast I didn't even notice.

3444
04:03:01,390 --> 04:03:03,030
That guy's dead.

3445
04:03:04,710 --> 04:03:05,150
Um...

3446
04:03:05,150 --> 04:03:12,530
Because the Minto is excellent in all things, she will surely notice if she hasn't, the Gravity Gun's little arms will open when aiming at things you can pick up.

3447
04:03:13,110 --> 04:03:13,810
Yeah, I know that.

3448
04:03:13,890 --> 04:03:14,870
It also makes a sound.

3449
04:03:22,350 --> 04:03:23,230
I think...

3450
04:03:23,230 --> 04:03:24,550
Sometimes you guys think I'm really dumb.

3451
04:03:27,410 --> 04:03:28,990
Can't tell... Oh, that guy's definitely...

3452
04:03:38,610 --> 04:03:39,490
One down!

3453
04:03:39,610 --> 04:03:40,010
One down!

3454
04:03:42,050 --> 04:03:42,950
Oh, there he is.

3455
04:03:43,450 --> 04:03:44,070
Wait.

3456
04:03:54,890 --> 04:03:57,250
So able to get in between the cracks.

3457
04:03:58,250 --> 04:03:59,650
This guy's really freaking out though.

3458
04:04:04,700 --> 04:04:06,480
I can't tell where it's...

3459
04:04:07,880 --> 04:04:08,750
It's like...

3460
04:04:09,040 --> 04:04:10,100
Ah, there we go.

3461
04:04:11,340 --> 04:04:11,700
Easy.

3462
04:04:12,620 --> 04:04:16,560
Take care of them before we even have to worry about them.

3463
04:04:21,090 --> 04:04:22,980
Any more head crabs in here?

3464
04:04:24,830 --> 04:04:25,430
Oh, hold on.

3465
04:04:26,090 --> 04:04:27,090
She knows.

3466
04:04:35,390 --> 04:04:37,030
Yeah, this is a good save spot, you're right.

3467
04:04:38,210 --> 04:04:41,690
I probably should do like a hard save instead of like a...

3468
04:04:41,690 --> 04:04:42,110
You know.

3469
04:04:43,070 --> 04:04:43,910
Are we in the prison?

3470
04:04:46,870 --> 04:04:47,030
Oh.

3471
04:04:47,470 --> 04:04:47,630
Oh.

3472
04:04:50,130 --> 04:04:51,050
Freaky zombie.

3473
04:04:53,550 --> 04:04:54,370
I hear them.

3474
04:04:56,290 --> 04:04:57,330
Where are my babies at?

3475
04:04:58,210 --> 04:04:59,230
I lost them.

3476
04:05:00,690 --> 04:05:01,930
You're in the entrance.

3477
04:05:02,330 --> 04:05:04,990
Maybe then we call it here.

3478
04:05:07,090 --> 04:05:07,570
Courtyard.

3479
04:05:10,410 --> 04:05:11,130
Oh, there's a ladder.

3480
04:05:24,470 --> 04:05:25,930
I took out the light!

3481
04:05:26,310 --> 04:05:27,690
And him at the same time!

3482
04:05:34,810 --> 04:05:36,410
Some other guy took over, though.

3483
04:05:36,590 --> 04:05:37,050
So sad.

3484
04:05:38,710 --> 04:05:39,790
I wish I could snipe.

3485
04:05:44,710 --> 04:05:46,390
I wish I could snipe always.

3486
04:05:47,910 --> 04:05:48,630
Oops.

3487
04:05:51,430 --> 04:05:52,430
Oh my god!

3488
04:05:53,290 --> 04:05:56,470
The force at which these hit them is crazy.

3489
04:06:07,010 --> 04:06:08,130
Maybe we call it.

3490
04:06:10,510 --> 04:06:11,990
Oh yes, yeah, I got those guys.

3491
04:06:12,610 --> 04:06:14,450
And then...

3492
04:06:16,880 --> 04:06:17,380
Damn.

3493
04:06:19,400 --> 04:06:20,560
Is this a sneaking mission?

3494
04:06:21,360 --> 04:06:21,720
No.

3495
04:06:30,350 --> 04:06:31,070
Okay.

3496
04:06:32,750 --> 04:06:33,590
Not anymore.

3497
04:06:37,700 --> 04:06:41,740
Where are they hitting me from?

3498
04:06:41,960 --> 04:06:45,280
Oh my gosh.

3499
04:06:49,280 --> 04:06:50,120
Can I get up there?

3500
04:06:53,870 --> 04:06:54,490
Can I get up here?

3501
04:06:56,410 --> 04:06:57,390
That'd be kind of cool.

3502
04:06:57,670 --> 04:06:58,190
Do they...

3503
04:06:58,190 --> 04:06:59,870
How do they eat?

3504
04:07:02,910 --> 04:07:04,730
Good thing you still have your bug friends.

3505
04:07:05,790 --> 04:07:06,470
Where are they?

3506
04:07:10,510 --> 04:07:10,990
Oh!

3507
04:07:11,070 --> 04:07:11,450
Oh!

3508
04:07:11,730 --> 04:07:12,350
They're coming.

3509
04:07:14,150 --> 04:07:15,710
Hello, one bug friend.

3510
04:07:16,090 --> 04:07:17,210
And two bug friends.

3511
04:07:17,530 --> 04:07:18,370
My bug babies.

3512
04:07:19,270 --> 04:07:20,890
I'm gonna name you Barry Bug.

3513
04:07:21,970 --> 04:07:23,230
And Barrent Bug.

3514
04:07:24,390 --> 04:07:24,730
Okay.

3515
04:07:27,290 --> 04:07:27,850
Okay.

3516
04:07:28,290 --> 04:07:28,730
For real.

3517
04:07:28,910 --> 04:07:29,470
I should save.

3518
04:07:29,630 --> 04:07:29,930
I should.

3519
04:07:30,110 --> 04:07:30,490
I save.

3520
04:07:30,670 --> 04:07:30,990
I save.

3521
04:07:31,270 --> 04:07:31,750
We're fine.

3522
04:07:32,270 --> 04:07:32,690
Okay.

3523
04:07:34,010 --> 04:07:35,170
Do they know Barry?

3524
04:07:35,530 --> 04:07:37,190
No, how bugs know each other?

3525
04:07:38,450 --> 04:07:39,010
No.

3526
04:07:39,510 --> 04:07:40,710
I mean, she might, though.

3527
04:07:41,070 --> 04:07:42,030
Who am I to say?

3528
04:07:42,630 --> 04:07:43,890
Sorry, I'm having so much fun.

3529
04:07:43,990 --> 04:07:45,530
I don't want to stop, but I need to.

3530
04:07:46,170 --> 04:07:47,050
I need to stop.

3531
04:07:47,830 --> 04:07:48,890
Okay, I'm having so much fun, though.

3532
04:07:49,130 --> 04:07:49,670
Okay, I need to stop.

3533
04:07:50,010 --> 04:07:50,490
I need...

3534
04:07:50,490 --> 04:07:51,150
I put the...

3535
04:07:51,150 --> 04:07:51,670
I'm...

3536
04:07:51,670 --> 04:07:52,230
Hands off!

3537
04:07:52,710 --> 04:07:53,910
Hands off the controller.

3538
04:07:54,850 --> 04:07:55,290
Hands...

3539
04:07:55,290 --> 04:07:55,910
I'm not controller.

3540
04:07:56,070 --> 04:07:56,610
The keyboard.

3541
04:07:57,710 --> 04:07:58,310
Hands off.

3542
04:08:00,030 --> 04:08:01,370
Hands off, hands off.

3543
04:08:01,430 --> 04:08:01,610
Okay.

3544
04:08:02,330 --> 04:08:03,950
What are we at now?

3545
04:08:04,870 --> 04:08:05,110
Load.

3546
04:08:05,930 --> 04:08:06,550
Sand traps.

3547
04:08:06,650 --> 04:08:08,270
We're still at sand traps.

3548
04:08:08,330 --> 04:08:10,890
I thought we would get to a new chapter, but...

3549
04:08:11,070 --> 04:08:13,070
Not quite, I suppose.

3550
04:08:14,010 --> 04:08:14,250
Ah!

3551
04:08:15,670 --> 04:08:17,230
This was fun!

3552
04:08:18,090 --> 04:08:20,430
I didn't expect to go for so long, to be honest.

3553
04:08:21,030 --> 04:08:21,930
But I couldn't stop.

3554
04:08:22,910 --> 04:08:24,230
I couldn't stop playing.

3555
04:08:24,630 --> 04:08:25,390
I had so much fun.

3556
04:08:25,870 --> 04:08:27,590
Logan, thank you so much for the vibe gifted.

3557
04:08:27,890 --> 04:08:29,950
I will be gone for the next couple of days.

3558
04:08:30,910 --> 04:08:32,610
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

3559
04:08:34,030 --> 04:08:34,990
Maybe Monday.

3560
04:08:35,130 --> 04:08:38,230
I will see how I feel once I'm home.

3561
04:08:39,390 --> 04:08:40,910

Keeps the watching video keeps the existential dread at bay.

3572
04:09:23,070 --> 04:09:24,390
No, don't have existential dread.

3573
04:09:26,230 --> 04:09:28,470
I will be playing Delta next week.

3574
04:09:29,310 --> 04:09:29,790

04:09:30,710 --> 04:09:31,570

04:09:32,450 --> 04:09:33,330
All day, Tuesday.

3577
04:09:34,950 --> 04:09:40,510
So if you want something to have on in the background all day long, baby, I'm your gal.

3578
04:09:41,070 --> 04:09:42,370
Oh, thank you so much for the 20 years.

Have a good day, have a good night.

3591
04:10:02,120 --> 04:10:03,320
Have a good time zone.

3592
04:10:04,400 --> 04:10:06,140

3595
04:10:10,760 --> 04:10:11,160
Wait.

3596
04:10:12,040 --> 04:10:13,860
Before I go throw away the card.

3597
04:10:14,860 --> 04:10:15,300
crowbar.

3598
04:10:16,080 --> 04:10:17,020
There we go.

3599
04:10:17,720 --> 04:10:19,300
One full size.

3600
04:10:19,760 --> 04:10:20,800
Full body.

3601
04:10:21,580 --> 04:10:22,240
Full body.

3602
04:10:22,380 --> 04:10:22,900
Full body.

3603
04:10:23,100 --> 04:10:23,520
Full body.

3604
04:10:23,960 --> 04:10:25,660
I never do like with other hair.

3605
04:10:27,380 --> 04:10:29,160
With this outfit yet.

3606
04:10:30,240 --> 04:10:30,660
Stummy?

3607
04:10:30,900 --> 04:10:31,080
Okay.

3608
04:10:31,240 --> 04:10:32,620
Wine stummy for the road.

3609
04:10:33,700 --> 04:10:35,540
Wine stummy for the road.

3610
04:10:36,000 --> 04:10:36,400
Bye bye.

3611
04:10:39,260 --> 04:10:40,140
Bye bye.

3612
04:10:40,220 --> 04:10:41,340
See you in a few days.

3613
04:10:41,480 --> 04:10:42,380
Or if I see you this weekend.

3614
04:10:42,520 --> 04:10:42,960
See you this weekend.

3615
04:10:43,080 --> 04:10:43,860
But if not, see you.

3616
04:10:43,880 --> 04:10:44,840
See you in a few days!

3617
04:10:45,140 --> 04:10:45,760
