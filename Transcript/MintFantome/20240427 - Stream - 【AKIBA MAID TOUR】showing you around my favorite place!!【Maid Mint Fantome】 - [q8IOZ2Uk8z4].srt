1
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,300
Welcome to Akihabara!

2
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,800
Say the line, boss.

3
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,200
Oh, come on.

4
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,380
I was just a few minutes late!

5
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,160
I was just a little bit late!

6
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,020
Kept you waiting, huh?

7
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,800
Welcome to Akihabara!

8
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,420
Welcome back, boss!

9
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,360
Miss!

10
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,700
Let's...

11
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,940
hop right...

12
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:18,900
in...

13
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,100
right...

14
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,060
I thought they used to do that thing where they'd like make you go...

15
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,100
I thought they did the...

16
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,160
Where are the glasses?

17
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,200
Thank you!

18
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,760
Hi.

19
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,380
Hi, Burberry.

20
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
Why is it so suspicious?

21
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,680
I'm back!

22
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,060
Yeah!

23
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,220
Oh, that's Google Earth!

24
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,920
Oh, we're in Google Maps.

25
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,220
Otaku glasses where?

26
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,060
Okay, hold on.

27
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,100
Gosh.

28
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,960
Is that better?

29
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,540
Is that better?

30
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,460
They're not...

31
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,980
otaku glasses, though.

32
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,760
They're just regular glasses.

33
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,140
Missing the halo.

34
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,300
TeaTuber, why?

35
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,240
Sorry!

36
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,580
I forgot I had to make my tea.

37
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,380
Yummy!

38
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,480
Hello, everybody.

39
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,920
I was gonna prepare like a whole thing for this.

40
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,120
And then...

41
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,400
I got busy.

42
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,580
So sorry.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,440
I was like, ready to have like a skit and everything.

44
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,680
In my brain.

45
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,060
Not ready on paper.

46
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,840
Ready in my brain.

47
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,600
But, um...

48
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,280
You know.

49
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,920
Actually, it's been several... well, it's several years since I...

50
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,960
since I streamed.

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,220
But, a long time ago, I did an Akiba tour.

52
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,460
I think it was for New Year's, actually.

53
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:27,980
So...

54
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,780
Improv time.

55
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,580
Okay, hold on.

56
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,010
Oh, wait.

57
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,690
I'm missing a prop.

58
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,120
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

59
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,700
Oh, oh.

60
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,430
Wait.

61
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,890
Don't... don't look.

62
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,270
Stop looking.

63
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,020
Stop looking.

64
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,320
Stop looking.

65
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,560
Um...

66
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,500
Hey!

67
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,630
Where's cool?

68
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,550
Oh, wait.

69
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:39,850
Hold on.

70
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,070
I'm all the way back there.

71
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,050
Oh, no!

72
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,830
I'm late for school!

73
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,860
Sorry for running into you!

74
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,660
I'm late for school!

75
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,340
Earthquake.

76
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,720
Um...

77
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,400
Oh!

78
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,080
You need to go to school too?

79
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,360
Do you go to Love Live Academy?

80
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,780
Just like me?

81
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,540
Oh, it's your first day of class?

82
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,740
Let me show you!

83
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,800
This shirt was $1,000.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,200
I don't have coffee.

85
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,900
What are you...

86
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,580
That's an entire loaf.

87
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,920
I'm a growing girl.

88
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,280
What do you want from me?

89
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,940
You are...

90
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:11,670
What was special food that you had a craving for?

91
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,090
I don't want to talk about it because...

92
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,850
I couldn't even get it.

93
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,010
Okay?

94
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,010
I'm really depressed about it actually.

95
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,070
So can we move on?

96
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,660
Where are you growing?

97
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,940
Don't... isn't it...

98
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,800
It's so rude to ask a lady her size.

99
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,020
Please.

100
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
You're going to V...

101
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,720
Not VTuber Academy.

102
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,760
To the...

103
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,700
To the Love Live Academy too?

104
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,020
Oh my god.

105
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,380
It's insane.

106
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,340
My bread has more physics than I do.

107
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,200
Oooh!

108
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,060
Oh my god.

109
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,800
It's the most jiggly bread in the world.

110
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,100
Why is it so jiggly?

111
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,040
Hahaha.

112
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,560
Hahaha.

113
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, I'll fix it.

114
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:11,960
Okay.

115
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,040
Let's get going!

116
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,920
We're going to be late for class!

117
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,440
Do you know where...

118
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,340
They went to...

119
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,680
Oh wait.

120
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,860
When they went to school in Love Live, it was...

121
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,600
Wait, it was...

122
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,640
The rival school.

123
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,480
Oh shoot.

124
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,800
It wasn't the Love Live girls.

125
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,820
Uh oh, I got it wrong.

126
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,100
Uh oh.

127
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,300
Yeah, A-Rise went here.

128
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,560
Hahaha.

129
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:45,960
Hahaha.

130
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,430
We're late!

131
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,130
We're late!

132
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,450
Hahaha.

133
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:53,970
Uh...

134
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,430
Just... Oh wait.

135
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,870
No, no.

136
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,190
Turn around.

137
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,490
Turn around.

138
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,190
Google!

139
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,490
This way!

140
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,230
Oh!

141
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,050
Oh my gosh.

142
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,410
They're just like me!

143
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,870
Ghost people.

144
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,070
Great bit.

145
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:06,790
Thanks, Mint.

146
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,470
A real knee slapper.

147
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,870
I knew you would like it.

148
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,630
Run.

149
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:16,850
Run.

150
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,130
Wait.

151
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,990
I'm trapped inside the...

152
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,470
I'm trapped inside the station!

153
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:24,590
Eh?

154
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,360
This...

155
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,540
How do I get out of the station?

156
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,980
How do I get out of the station?

157
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,680
It's already night time, even.

158
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,060
It's already night time, even.

159
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,160
Who put salt around the exit?

160
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,440
Eh?

161
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,740
I wonder what time they took this at.

162
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,540
Oh.

163
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,020
They all think I'm really suspicious, guys.

164
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,060
Oh no.

165
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,880
They're like, Hey, what's this ghost doing over here?

166
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,560
Hey, what's this ghost doing over here?

167
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:06,600
Hey, what's this ghost doing over here?

168
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,240
Why are we in Japan, but we got a Brooklyn accent?

169
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,960
Hey, what's that ghost doing over there with that bread of ours?

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,960
That jiggly bread?

171
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,720
Oh.

172
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,660
Oh.

173
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,360
Don't mind me, officer.

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
Don't mind me.

175
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,760
Let's just turn around from them.

176
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,880
Okay, let's go back in.

177
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,680
Oh no!

178
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,540
We can't go back!

179
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,600
Remilia?

180
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,640
Wait a second.

181
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,320
What is going on?

182
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,160
What is going on here?

183
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:59,360
Actually, it says that this was from October 2018, and I'm almost positive I was here.

184
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,240
Because I got...

185
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,840
I have goods from this collab.

186
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,940
And I went to Atore during this collab, so...

187
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,680
This...

188
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,380
One of these is probably me.

189
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,820
I

190
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,650
was in disguise.

191
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,290
Anyways, guys.

192
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:21,870
You know what?

193
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,870
This is already a little scuffed.

194
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:25,970
Oh!

195
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,550
It states...

196
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,710
Oh!

197
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,350
Flan!

198
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,250
Collaboration Event.

199
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,570
Let's just start from here.

200
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,030
Welcome!

201
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,190
To Akihabara!

202
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,950
Welcome, welcome!

203
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,570
Oh my gosh!

204
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,550
Thank you for the birthday gift and...

205
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,810
Kiss cubbies!

206
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,270
Thank you!

207
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,640
Yippie!

208
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,780
So Akihabara actually...

209
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:08,200
Akihabara station at least has two exits.

210
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,320
This is the electric town gate, as it says here.

211
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,320
And over there...

212
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,240
There's another one all the way down that end.

213
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,400
You can get to Yodobashi more easily.

214
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,800
So...

215
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,380
Total stream when?

216
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,340
When?

217
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,120
I wonder.

218
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,840
That's a good idea.

219
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,460
That's a good idea.

220
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,780
Wait...

221
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,800
Oh no...

222
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,100
I tried turning off...

223
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,660
Sorry, wait.

224
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,940
Let me see if I can fix something real quick.

225
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,580
So sorry, guys.

226
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,940
I tried turning off the notifs for like the members when they become members through gifted.

227
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,740
Since it kind of clogs up the...

228
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,260
clogs up the notifications a little bit.

229
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,140
But I don't... maybe it didn't work.

230
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,240
Yeah, I turned it off.

231
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,220
But it didn't work.

232
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,960
I'll try it later.

233
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,540
Chat is basically danmaku and you're pretty good at handling that.

234
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,060
So...

235
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,760
Where's the chubby girl's maid cafe at?

236
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,680
Maximum!

237
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,540
I'll get there!

238
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,180
I'll get there!

239
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,980
I'll get there!

240
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,980
Holy crap, ghosts.

241
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,860
Yeah, these are the ghosts of Akihabara Station.

242
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,140
These are the ghosts of Akihabara Station.

243
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,060
Spooky!

244
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,760
And that...

245
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,600
That's...

246
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,760
Um...

247
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,100
That's the...

248
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,800
See the ghost.

249
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,460
This is where you pay respect.

250
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,740
So yeah, once you leave Electric Town Gate...

251
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,280
Um...

252
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,440
Here's where you can buy your tickets or charge your suika or passimo.

253
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,220
You come here...

254
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,580
Oh!

255
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,700
Scary!

256
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,460
This is...

257
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,500
Katore, right here.

258
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,200
Wow!

259
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,660
Oh my god!

260
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,120
Look, they're all worshipping Remilia!

261
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,460
Ah, Remilia-sama!

262
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,240
Kawaii!

263
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,180
Remilia-sama, kyou mo kawaii!

264
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm so glad that this is...

265
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,940
That this is like this.

266
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,540
Um, they do...

267
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,800
Anime collabs here about like every...

268
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,520
Two or three weeks...

269
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,780
I think, so...

270
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,180
Um, it's always rotating...

271
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,080
To different stuff.

272
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,820
Look at them.

273
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,100
Oh!

274
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,420
He's bowing, he's praying.

275
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,820
They're in line to pray!

276
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,580
To Remilia-sama.

277
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,240
But flan is best to who?

278
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,160
How dare you!

279
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,620
Remilia-sama is...

280
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,180
Justice!

281
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,320
Justice!

282
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,350
It was Bochy the Rock when I was there last.

283
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,330
Oh, I was supposed to be there for Bochy too!

284
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,190
So this is obviously Halloween time because...

285
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,310
Yeah...

286
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,210
Can I get out of here?

287
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:18,690
Can I escape?

288
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,410
So, if you go out...

289
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,890
If you're facing the gates...

290
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,490
And you go this way...

291
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,210
Out the left side...

292
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,190
How can I change it so it's not night time?

293
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,710
Oh my gosh!

294
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,810
Wait, this is so old!

295
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,430
They haven't even finished the hotel here yet!

296
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,710
That's crazy!

297
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,290
That's so crazy!

298
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,830
Wait, can I change the year?

299
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,170
How can I change the year?

300
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,270
Um...

301
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,050
Remilia-sama...

302
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,590
Charisma is amazing!

303
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,950
Yes!

304
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,750
I think so too!

305
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,490
Yeah, and it still says Sega!

306
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,130
Eh...

307
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,470
How nostalgic...

308
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,930
How do I change the date?

309
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,610
Hmm...

310
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,230
Hmm...

311
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,090
Hmm...

312
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,400
Hmm...

313
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Hold on...

314
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,360
Let me maybe try going back to...

315
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,300
The map...

316
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,420
And then we're gonna zoom in here...

317
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,340
Maybe it'll give us a different date...

318
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,320
If I come in...

319
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,500
Like right here...

320
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,140
Aha!

321
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,600
July 2022!

322
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,660
July 2022!

323
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,500
Welcome to...

324
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,660
Havara Station!

325
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,620
There we go!

326
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,140
If you ever see these people...

327
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,340
They um...

328
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,740
They often do blood drives in Akiba...

329
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,100
I've never done it before...

330
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,680
Because I'm terrified of needles...

331
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
But if you can...

332
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,900
If you can donate the blood...

333
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,740
I recommend!

334
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,460
And now...

335
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,180
The hotel that I talked about...

336
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,360
Is completed...

337
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,300
There's a New Days Konbini right here...

338
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,880
I've actually...

339
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,020
I've never stayed at this hotel before either...

340
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,340
But...

341
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,120
Um...

342
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,320
Yeah you got the Gigo here...

343
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,460
Which is your um...

344
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,440
Which is your arcade...

345
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,680
Used to be Sega as you saw...

346
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,460
Um...

347
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,880
Yeah...

348
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,440
Don't know how much to say about that...

349
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,080
It's kinda sad...

350
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,800
Let's see...

351
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,820
If we go down here...

352
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,640
In here you have a Made Dreamin...

353
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,980
Um...

354
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,620
This is the Heaven's Gate location...

355
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,100
Which if you're going to Made Dreamin...

356
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,820
I recommend this one the most...

357
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,880
Because it's the biggest...

358
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,160
And I think they have the best live stage and stuff like that...

359
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,960
So...

360
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,300
Love Live...

361
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,020
Love Live...

362
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,540
Collaboration Cafe...

363
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,940
Um...

364
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,080
One... Two...

365
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,420
Three... Four...

366
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,360
Five... Six...

367
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,180
Eight... Nine...

368
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,040
Two... Two... Ten?

369
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,640
Hahaha...

370
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,860
Bro thinks she goes here...

371
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,780
Hahaha...

372
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,840
But...

373
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,140
I thought there were only nine girls...

374
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,100
Eh?

375
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,860
Hahaha...

376
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,180
Miku is...

377
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,500
I never knew that they had a collab like that...

378
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,820
That's so awesome...

379
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,100
Ahem...

380
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,900
Miku jump scare...

381
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,020
Yeah right?

382
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,260
There's some...

383
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,660
Tourists like...

384
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,400
T-shirt places here...

385
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,740
This is M's...

386
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,480
Which is just a giant...

387
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,560
Sexy store...

388
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,700
You know what I mean...

389
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,580
It's just a giant...

390
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,740
Everything is sexy in here...

391
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,360
It says sexy, sexy store...

392
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,480
Hahaha...

393
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,760
I like the...

394
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,740
I like the standees they have out here...

395
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,360
Sometimes they have a...

396
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,700
Vtuber advertising...

397
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,040
Stuff...

398
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,980
On...

399
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,360
On the television as well...

400
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,840
What does that mean?

401
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,840
Let's go in?

402
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,900
Can we?

403
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,920
No...

404
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,900
What's this though?

405
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,260
...

406
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,740
I don't know what that...

407
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,780
What that is...

408
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,080
I don't know what that's advertising...

409
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,600
Hahaha...

410
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,560
Dangerous building...

411
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,400
It's dangerous...

412
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:32,920
Hahaha...

413
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,840
Yeah...

414
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
It's a bit of...

415
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,240
Let's see...

416
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,620
If you're wanting a hotel that is...

417
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,240
Sorry...

418
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,780
I feel like my tour is going to be all over the place...

419
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,060
If you guys have any specific questions, let me know...

420
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,860
But if you're looking for a hotel...

421
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,800
A good hotel in the Akiba area...

422
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,260
There's this Washington Hotel...

423
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,660
I've stayed here before...

424
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,540
I recommend it...

425
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,940
It's very close...

426
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,120
Of course to the station...

427
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,220
And obviously to everything as well...

428
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,340
So if you need a good hotel...

429
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,360
I recommend...

430
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,520
What's a good hotel?

431
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,780
I'm glad you asked!

432
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,600
If you're looking for a good hotel...

433
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,860
I recommend...

434
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,360
Oh god...

435
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,180
We have to get past...

436
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,860
We can't go past the patchy slot...

437
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,880
The pachinko machine...

438
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,040
Pachinko parlor...

439
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,020
Wait, we're stuck?

440
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,660
We have to go past the pachinko...

441
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,920
Our body is getting sucked into the pachinko...

442
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,140
Where's the McDonald's?

443
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,260
I can show you!

444
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,660
Wait, how do I get back?

445
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,720
What is wrong with Google Maps anymore?

446
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,580
Why am I stuck in certain places?

447
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,600
Did he lose the footage?

448
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,280
What happened?

449
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,260
What happened?

450
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,000
Well...

451
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,860
I was going to show you over there...

452
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,920
But I guess we can't...

453
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,320
Uh oh, I'm stuck again...

454
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,100
Oh!

455
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,560
Maybe let me try with my mouse instead...

456
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,100
Ah!

457
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,000
I mean not my mouse...

458
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,940
My keyboard...

459
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,210
There it is!

460
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,010
And there's also a Denny's right here...

461
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,570
So...

462
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,750
It's kind of convenient...

463
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,850
To have the hotel...

464
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,750
And then the Denny's...

465
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,330
Mr. Donut Doko...

466
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,370
I'm getting there!

467
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,270
I'm getting there!

468
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,470
You guys are so impatient!

469
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,570
Oh my gosh, but you guys are just excited...

470
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,510
I get it, me too...

471
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,490
This part of the Akiba station...

472
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,890
There's like a Starbucks...

473
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,710
And there's a Muji...

474
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,950
And there's a GU...

475
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,010
So if you want some more normie kind of stuff...

476
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,450
It's over here...

477
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,530
But down this way...

478
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:52,290
Meow...

479
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,750
Meow...

480
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,590
Wow!

481
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,390
The container is still here...

482
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,870
But it's not anymore, unfortunately...

483
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,770
This used to be a store...

484
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,530
Where they would have collab...

485
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,850
Stuff with like...

486
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,330
Different games and anime and stuff like that...

487
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,710
But unfortunately...

488
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,710
It's not anymore...

489
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,250
We'll also go down here...

490
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,670
This will...

491
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,090
I'll lead you all back home, don't worry...

492
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:19,990
Meow...

493
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,730
Woah!

494
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,310
So here's Yodobashi...

495
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,950
Which is like your big...

496
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,050
Yodobashi camera...

497
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,570
It's your big electronic store...

498
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,290
There's so many floors...

499
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,170
And then up top there's also like...

500
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,630
Lots of restaurants...

501
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,010
There's Tower Records...

502
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,870
There's a Daiso in there...

503
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,050
If you're looking for like...

504
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,770
What's it called?

505
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,090
Yodobashi is huge!

506
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:47,690
Yeah!

507
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,310
It's so... so big!

508
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,210
This was what Akihabara was originally known for...

509
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,010
Before anime...

510
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,630
It was known for their electronic stuff...

511
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,030
Well... yes...

512
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,150
But more so like the smaller...

513
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,190
Electronic stores, right?

514
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,610
But also in here are a lot of...

515
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,470
Great...

516
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,590
Can we go in there?

517
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,430
No...

518
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,730
In here there's a lot of good little stores...

519
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,930
There's like a crepe store...

520
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,190
There's Jack and the Donuts...

521
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,970
Which I suggest you don't...

522
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:19,910
There's Takoyaki...

523
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,230
There's...

524
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,210
There's several places...

525
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,770
And then right here is a cat cafe...

526
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,310
Which I've never been to before though...

527
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,610
So...

528
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,910
Yeah...

529
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,990
Now if we...

530
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,190
Turn around...

531
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,370
This is the other side...

532
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,110
This is that other exit I talked about earlier...

533
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,030
So...

534
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,450
What in the donuts?

535
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,030
I think you heard me...

536
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,150
What if Akiba had...

537
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,890
Oh sorry...

538
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,010
I was reading the wrong one...

539
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,390
I was wondering last time you went...

540
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,550
Do you still hear the May Dreaming song play basically everywhere?

541
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,010
Only in one place do I hear...

542
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,670
The May Dreaming song play...

543
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,310
Only in one place...

544
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,850
And I can show you where they still play it...

545
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,650
Top left corner...

546
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,550
See there's a more dates button to switch quickly...

547
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,190
Oh it wasn't there before though...

548
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,530
Oh...

549
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,590
Did I miss it just before?

550
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,310
Also I can't believe I'm backseating Google Maps...

551
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,870
Let's go...

552
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,970
What if Akiba had a waffle house?

553
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,050
What if Akiba had a waffle house?

554
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,350
That would make it perfect...

555
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,330
To be honest...

556
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,990
If you were asking about the McDonald's...

557
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,170
Here's one of them...

558
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,290
Here's one McDonald's...

559
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,170
That Akiba has to offer you...

560
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,350
But there's actually another one...

561
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,030
What if Akiba got a Wendy's?

562
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,290
Okay that I would be very excited about...

563
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:43,830
Because...

564
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,470
I actually like First Kitchen very much...

565
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,050
Haha...

566
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,570
But yeah...

567
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,590
You can go in here and get some snacks...

568
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,430
There's also...

569
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,270
If you need to take the Hibiya line...

570
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,610
So this is the JR...

571
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,250
So you're gonna have like...

572
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,410
The Yamanote line and...

573
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,070
Chiyoda line...

574
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,650
And...

575
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,770
All those...

576
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,570
What's the yellow one?

577
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,390
Oh my god...

578
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,670
I can't remember the names anymore...

579
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,550
Jack and the Donut...

580
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,070
Hahaha...

581
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,170
It's delicious...

582
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,850
Chuo!

583
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,430
Thank you...

584
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,110
Thank you...

585
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,730
If you come to Akiba...

586
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,250
And you are taking the Hibiya line...

587
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,470
You will come out...

588
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,970
Over here actually...

589
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,310
So if you're just like...

590
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,570
Wait this doesn't look like the Akihabara...

591
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,530
I saw in Mint's stream...

592
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,530
Actually I wonder if we can get over there...

593
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,070
I wonder...

594
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,630
I wonder...

595
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,110
If we can...

596
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,830
If we can zoom...

597
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,210
Sorry if the zoom is a little...

598
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,750
I'm trying not to go too fast...

599
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,270
To give you a whiplash...

600
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,210
Here!

601
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,270
This is where you'll come out...

602
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,770
The Metro...

603
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,770
So if you just go through this little way...

604
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,790
And then...

605
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,130
Walk walk walk walk...

606
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,970
You'll reach Akiba over here...

607
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,450
Mhmm...

608
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,830
You're running over everyone...

609
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,750
Hahaha... I know...

610
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:22,650
Um...

611
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,910
But yeah...

612
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,610
We're just gonna focus on the main...

613
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,230
Maybe like...

614
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,290
Well not entirely Chuo Dori...

615
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,930
We'll go to a couple other places too...

616
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,450
So...

617
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,550
You walk walk walk...

618
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,650
What if you come down this way?

619
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,170
I wonder can we go in here?

620
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,530
Can we go in here?

621
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:42,910
Um...

622
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:46,980
I think we can...

623
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,160
So if you accidentally...

624
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,200
Don't go out the electric exit gate...

625
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,780
Hey Mint I know you're probably not gonna see this...

626
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,080
But I'm such a big fan...

627
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,720
Oh my gosh...

628
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,100
Thank you...

629
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,920
Thank you...

630
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,080
Yes...

631
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,060
Sometimes you can choose from the main map...

632
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,100
Let's see if it'll let me...

633
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,000
It's like this...

634
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,240
Tiny...

635
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,820
No...

636
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,900
It doesn't look like they filmed in there...

637
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,760
It's okay...

638
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,980
I'm blocking it but...

639
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,460
So if you don't go through the electric town exit...

640
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,700
And you come out the other side...

641
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,340
What if you're like...

642
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,560
Oh gosh I got lost...

643
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,440
And then...

644
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,600
Welcome back Mint...

645
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,740
What is post-pandemic Akiba like?

646
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,120
Chuo Dori has looked like a ghost town lol on Street View recently...

647
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,920
And 99% of doujin stores closed...

648
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,620
What in tarnation is going on there now?

649
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,160
Akiba is crowded as heck...

650
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,820
Maybe in Street View it's very not crowded but...

651
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,860
Oh my gosh...

652
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,300
It's extremely crowded all the time...

653
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,260
Very very often...

654
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,580
So it's definitely not dying...

655
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,440
Which is great...

656
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,420
You're definitely not going to see this...

657
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,120
But I'm a very small fan...

658
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,660
Teeny tiny...

659
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,140
Yeah unfortunately...

660
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,840
Torano Ana did close...

661
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,400
Which is so sad but...

662
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,580
Yeah...

663
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,680
Anyway, you guys let me explain...

664
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,980
If you go through here...

665
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,980
You'll get back to where we saw that...

666
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,140
Made Dreamin...

667
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,520
But also in here...

668
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,680
Is the Square Enix Cafe...

669
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,180
Which they also do like monthly...

670
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,960
Collab stuff...

671
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,000
Last time I was there...

672
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
They were doing the Final Fantasy 7 one...

673
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,080
But it was busy every single day...

674
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,740
But certain...

675
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,700
So you like needed a reservation...

676
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,400
But there's also a takeout menu...

677
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,600
Which so you can get takeout stuff...

678
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,660
And also...

679
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,340
There's a store...

680
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,020
Which you can just kind of walk into...

681
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,420
You don't have to have a reservation at the cafe...

682
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,100
And...

683
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,480
But if it's also like...

684
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,520
A not as popular game...

685
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,800
That they're doing...

686
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,260
Or a popular property...

687
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,580
Because sometimes they've done like Fullmetal Alchemist too...

688
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,700
Like a permanent Square Enix Cafe...

689
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,320
Not a pop-up...

690
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,260
Yeah it's permanent...

691
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,940
There's also like some crane games in here...

692
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,040
There's a few...

693
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,420
There's a few restaurants in here as well...

694
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,920
There's actually...

695
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,960
There's actually quite a lot going on in this little small space...

696
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,200
So...

697
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,540
Check it out...

698
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,060
Even though it's just a tiny tunnel...

699
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,340
I'm a ceiling fan...

700
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,460
Wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh...

701
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,560
Wuh wuh wuh...

702
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,140
That's my sound of a ceiling...

703
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,800
Wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh wuh...

704
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,340
There's a restaurant up in here...

705
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,400
Oh...

706
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,700
I don't know what happened...

707
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,960
I've never stayed at this Rem Akiba before...

708
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,760
But...

709
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,060
It might be good...

710
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,680
I don't know...

711
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,140
I'm an average size fan...

712
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,220
Thank you for being...

713
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,040
Thank you for sharing your average-ness...

714
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,160
Uh oh...

715
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,540
I don't usually recommend going to...

716
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,420
Book-offs and stuff...

717
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,880
In super crowded places...

718
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,760
Like Akiba...

719
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
But if you're looking for a book-off...

720
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,100
It's over here...

721
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,280
By Danka...

722
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,800
So...

723
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,860
But I've gone in here before...

724
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,920
I've gotten a couple things...

725
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,480
I've been able to find some things...

726
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,140
That are pretty cool...

727
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,300
Thank you...

728
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,620
You're welcome...

729
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,860
And there's also like some...

730
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,580
Other like...

731
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,460
Tourist shops...

732
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,540
But not so many over here...

733
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,680
It's the big...

734
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,900
This is like...

735
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,280
I always...

736
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,320
Sometimes if I come to Akiba...

737
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,800
In the...

738
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,300
In the mornings...

739
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,760
I see a line of people waiting for the...

740
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,160
Pachinko...

741
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,480
Lined up right here...

742
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,420
In the mornings...

743
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,680
It's pretty...

744
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,380
They're ready...

745
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,620
They're ready to pachinko...

746
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,400
You'll definitely see this...

747
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,860
But I'm like one of those fancy modern...

748
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,480
High tech bladeless fans...

749
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,580
Like a Dyson fan...

750
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,460
Wow...

751
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,660
From here you can see Pasera...

752
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,100
We're gonna go down that way now...

753
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,500
So yeah...

754
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,340
This is the tunnel...

755
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,760
That we would've gone through...

756
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,160
If they would've let us...

757
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,800
There's the hotel here...

758
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,960
There's a little...

759
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,600
It says ice cream but it's like...

760
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,620
They have...

761
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,780
They have like...

762
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,180
Yakiimo and stuff like that...

763
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,100
Yummy...

764
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,920
Can I...

765
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,340
If I move over just a tiny bit...

766
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,300
A little...

767
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,900
I went the wrong way...

768
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:51,940
Wait...

769
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,640
I was gonna see if I could zoom in and see the square...

770
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,300
It's like blocked by the pole though...

771
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,280
But it's on this side...

772
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Mr. Donodoko...

773
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,160
Hold on...

774
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,260
Hold on...

775
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,680
They opened Yostar shop...

776
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,880
Right in front of the station...

777
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,180
Really?

778
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,500
Wait when?

779
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,520
Cause I know there was a Yostar shop at...

780
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,040
In the anime...

781
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,240
Minecraft?

782
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,660
I want to Minecraft so bad...

783
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,120
I want to Minecraft...

784
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,760
I want to play block game...

785
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,160
I want to play block game...

786
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:40,300
I want to play block game...

787
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,500
There's one...

788
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,000
There was a Sega obviously...

789
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,440
But they still do it as Gigo...

790
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,600
Which I'm really happy about...

791
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,240
There's one that does like the themed Tayaki...

792
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,980
I'll show you guys that one...

793
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,740
Later...

794
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,620
But right now the...

795
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,960
The atre is Yuru Yuru...

796
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,000
Yuru Yuru...

797
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,880
Yuru Yuru...

798
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:02,960
Um...

799
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,440
If you go in...

800
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,040
On the second floor...

801
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,380
On the second floor is where you can...

802
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,820
Find whatever pop-up shop...

803
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,500
Is going on...

804
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,360
Last year my cousin was at Akiba...

805
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,300
And I asked him to get a few Konami Famicom games...

806
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,980
At Super Potato...

807
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,300
But they were a bit expensive...

808
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,440
Do you know a place that sells retro games for cheaper?

809
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:25,840
...

810
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,960
I know another place...

811
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,380
I can't say it's that much cheaper though...

812
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,780
At Akiba...

813
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,220
Because it's like kinda really...

814
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,080
Picked over...

815
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,900
Things are gonna be...

816
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,880
Kind of...

817
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,180
Why is one of the windows empty?

818
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,940
It's actually so sad...

819
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,420
That Akarin is getting...

820
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,180
Blocked by the Momoi Dokei...

821
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:53,580
...

822
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,700
Momoi Clock...

823
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,100
It's called the Momoi Dokei...

824
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,740
Momoi Clock...

825
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,420
Momoi Clock...

826
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,320
And it's kind of like...

827
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,540
You know...

828
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,460
It's been here for a year...

829
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,440
Like decades...

830
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,660
It's always just been like...

831
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,640
This...

832
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,960
Symbol of Akiba...

833
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,300
And it's...

834
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,680
Block blocked...

835
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,640
Nooo...

836
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,700
Hahahaha...

837
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,820
Yeah the Momoi Clock...

838
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,320
So...

839
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,620
Yeah...

840
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,520
Because Momoi Haruko...

841
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,580
She kind of like...

842
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,200
She would like...

843
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,540
She would have meetings here...

844
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:39,940
And...

845
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,040
She even has a song about this clock...

846
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,120
Like it's...

847
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,760
It's just...

848
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,420
It got moved before...

849
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,620
It was in a different spot...

850
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,480
I don't remember where...

851
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,260
It got moved a little after they did...

852
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,000
Some construction on the station...

853
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,640
But...

854
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,380
Yeah...

855
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,920
But also as you can see...

856
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,720
Up here they have like a Uniqlo...

857
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,100
The Idolmaster shop is up here too...

858
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,740
The Idolmaster official shop...

859
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:06,660
Kazpa...

860
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,800
Which if you don't know...

861
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,460
There's several Kazpas in Akiba but...

862
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,460
They also have like...

863
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,700
Oh yeah 3 coins...

864
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,220
If you want a good...

865
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:15,780
Like...

866
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,860
It's not a 100 yen store...

867
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,100
But it's like 3 coins...

868
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,980
It's like 300 yen...

869
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,200
Everything is really high quality and nice...

870
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,220
Even though most of it is 300 yen...

871
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,900
Momoi Haruko...

872
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,780
Queen of Akiba...

873
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,420
Yeah...

874
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,680
But yeah...

875
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,220
There's also a bookstore up here too...

876
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,960
There's also a bookstore up here too...

877
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,340
And...

878
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,080
The Kazpa is selling like...

879
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,100
Recently they've been selling these like...

880
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,560
Last time I went...

881
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,220
I think it was Quintessential Quintuplets...

882
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,620
But it was like little cakes...

883
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,780
And stuff too...

884
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,220
So I thought that was kind of neat...

885
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,800
I didn't grab one but...

886
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,340
You have some...

887
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,380
Other electronic things here...

888
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,380
Wait...

889
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,040
Am I trapped again?

890
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,880
Uh oh...

891
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,380
Forward!

892
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,460
Forward!

893
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,460
Uh oh...

894
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,500
Here we go...

895
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:15,880
And here...

896
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,480
Can I go back?

897
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,000
This way?

898
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,580
A little more?

899
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,580
No?

900
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,500
Okay...

901
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,260
Here is...

902
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,640
Najiokaikan!

903
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,520
Yeah!

904
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,320
Najiokaikan!

905
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,380
This is like a big...

906
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,500
Mega Otaku...

907
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,620
Building...

908
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,840
There's so many things...

909
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,220
If you want a card shop...

910
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,000
Here... If you want...

911
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,500
They have not only A-Zone...

912
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,620
But they also have...

913
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,800
They also have...

914
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,040
What's the other one called?

915
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,760
Oh my god...

916
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,980
My brain...

917
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,460
The ones that do doll fees...

918
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,580
The ones that...

919
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,000
VULKS!

920
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,500
Thank you!

921
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,700
They have VULKS as well...

922
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,680
They actually closed the Cospo and Atore one...

923
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,460
What?

924
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,340
That must have been very recent...

925
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,720
Really?

926
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,340
I think they are opening a Love Live shop down the hall from the iMath store where the Cospo used to be...

927
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,580
Wait but they were right next to each other...

928
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,100
The Cospo and the...

929
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,740
The Cospo and the Idolmaster store were right next to each other...

930
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,180
The Cospo and the Idolmaster store were right next to each other...

931
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,580
Are you sure?

932
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,460
What?

933
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,220
How soon did that happen?

934
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,540
That must be very very recently...

935
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,600
I didn't see it last month...

936
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,280
I didn't see it last month...

937
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,160
Did you show Mandarake?

938
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,280
Mandrake?

939
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,880
No I haven't... We haven't gotten down there yet...

940
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,020
But yeah...

941
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,140
So this is like...

942
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,540
Everything...

943
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,260
There's also... Right here is a cute little gift...

944
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,860
It says gift shop...

945
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,840
Like a good...

946
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,720
Omiyage...

947
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,280
Presents!

948
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:05,940
Souvenirs!

949
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,360
Souvenirs...

950
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,540
Yeah...

951
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,200
So I definitely recommend...

952
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,420
You could spend forever here...

953
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,580
There's K-Books... There's AmiAmi...

954
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,880
Like I said there's...

955
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,920
There's a card shop...

956
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,120
There's just regular figure places...

957
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,000
There's...

958
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,280
There's like an airsoft place too...

959
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,720
There's like an airsoft place too...

960
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,000
So...

961
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,700
Lots and lots of stuff...

962
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,900
And of course there are big Uma Musume...

963
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,280
Billboard right here...

964
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,700
And then they play like...

965
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,700
Ads and stuff here...

966
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,980
Which is kind of fun to see...

967
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,360
Look at this... This view is so...

968
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,240
Akihabara right?

969
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,220
Yeah...

970
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,700
Let's see... This is Pachinko...

971
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,340
In case you were like...

972
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,520
Wow Railgun...

973
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,900
Madoka... Evangelion...

974
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,880
It's just Pachinko...

975
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:05,920
Pachinko...

976
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,660
Pachinko...

977
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,080
Oh my god... This is...

978
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,920
So funny... Do you...

979
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,080
For people... Don't say if you know what this store is...

980
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,860
But do you wanna guess what this...

981
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,360
What this line is for?

982
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,500
Oh my gosh... This is so funny...

983
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,920
Because it even looks kind of early in the day...

984
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,240
Because there's not so many people...

985
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,700
So there's already people...

986
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,720
Lining up for this...

987
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,000
Crepes... Okay good... Figures...

988
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,640
Ramen...

989
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,340
Mmm...

990
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,700
Mmm...

991
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,860
Cards... Mmm...

992
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,560
Yeah like some of the stores aren't even open...

993
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,900
Like here's another card store...

994
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,040
Pancakes... Oh good guess...

995
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,220
This is for Ensemble Stars...

996
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,160
As you can see this is the Ensemble Stars store...

997
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,180
And so...

998
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,400
In the past...

999
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,260
You used to have a...

1000
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,040
You used to need a reservation to get in...

1001
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,200
But I think nowadays you can just kind of go...

1002
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,180
But this screen right here is always...

1003
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,780
Playing Ensemble Stars...

1004
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,860
So these people are up early in the morning...

1005
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,820
For On Stars...

1006
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,420
But it's right here...

1007
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,560
Right... I think it's...

1008
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,520
I think it's this one...

1009
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,900
But it's right...

1010
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,620
In the same building as Gamers...

1011
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,080
Which is...

1012
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,440
Of course an iconic store...

1013
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,900
In Akihabara...

1014
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,080
This is you know...

1015
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,860
Dejico from Digicara and everything...

1016
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,900
So the line is for pretty boys...

1017
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,660
Yeah...

1018
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,760
Look at them... Look at them...

1019
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,360
They're so excited to get their merch...

1020
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,660
Hahahaha...

1021
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,200
Hahahaha...

1022
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,160
Um...

1023
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,160
And...

1024
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:56,770
What is this?

1025
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,910
What is this?

1026
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,550
Tsubaki...

1027
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,110
What is this?

1028
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,150
I actually don't know...

1029
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,130
Sorry... I'm a fake fan...

1030
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,570
Kunoichi Tsubaki...

1031
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,960
Mmm...

1032
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,360
Forehead anime...

1033
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,700
Yeah I can tell...

1034
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
Why does it look like Takagi-san?

1035
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,800
Is it the same artist?

1036
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,220
She looks like Takagi-san...

1037
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,000
And forehead...

1038
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,360
Hahahaha...

1039
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,000
Oh it is the same artist...

1040
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,180
Hahahaha...

1041
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,480
I've never seen it though...

1042
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,900
But sometimes they do...

1043
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,560
Say there's a new single coming out...

1044
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,900
For an anime...

1045
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,420
They will...

1046
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,960
Typically the singer...

1047
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,840
Will have an event...

1048
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,520
At Gamers on the top floor...

1049
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,920
And they do other collaboration stuff too...

1050
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,120
Sometimes if a concert was released...

1051
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:54,960
If you go...

1052
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,920
And go shopping... You can see the...

1053
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,320
Say the costume...

1054
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,620
That the idol wore...

1055
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,180
Or the seiyuu wore...

1056
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,960
At the concert...

1057
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,320
So it's still fun to stop by...

1058
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,320
I like to go in there and check out what's kinda new sometimes...

1059
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,300
So earlier...

1060
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,660
Someone asked...

1061
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,140
Where can you still hear the made dreaming theme song played in Akiba?

1062
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,960
And it's this one!

1063
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,000
This one is always playing...

1064
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,720
The made dreaming theme song...

1065
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,160
So...

1066
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,380
If you walk by here...

1067
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,860
You'll definitely hear it...

1068
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,660
My long lost Oshii...

1069
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,480
Used to do regular shows up there...

1070
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,520
Wait who was it?

1071
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,220
Who was it?

1072
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,280
24 hour soba huh?

1073
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:41,640
Yes!

1074
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,980
This is Fujisoba!

1075
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,100
Which is a chain actually...

1076
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,980
But they are 24 hours...

1077
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,340
So if you're in Akiba...

1078
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,320
Maybe you are staying here in a hotel or something...

1079
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,380
And you're like... Oh my gosh...

1080
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,560
I'm hungry but I don't want konbini food...

1081
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,140
There is a Fujisoba here...

1082
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,940
That is 24 hours so...

1083
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,520
And it's a chain...

1084
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,040
So if you're somewhere else and you're like...

1085
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,880
Oh Fujisoba...

1086
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,500
Someone from Soundora...

1087
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,420
Don't want to go into it...

1088
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:09,900
Understandable...

1089
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:13,780
Yeah...

1090
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:14,840
But...

1091
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,960
They don't just have soba...

1092
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,620
I think they have other stuff too...

1093
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,720
Curry and things like that...

1094
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,320
And they do take out...

1095
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,800
This place right here...

1096
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,460
Used to be the Volks building...

1097
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,640
Used to be just a bunch of...

1098
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,260
This one is really depressing...

1099
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,320
To explain...

1100
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,400
It used to be the Volks building...

1101
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,760
And it used to have...

1102
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,640
Like a bunch of...

1103
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,260
Anime figure shops and...

1104
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,100
Collab stores and things like that...

1105
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,320
Unfortunately...

1106
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,160
That's not the case anymore...

1107
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:48,780
But...

1108
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,800
It was empty for years...

1109
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,460
It was empty for a very long time...

1110
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,240
Until recently...

1111
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,760
Until very recently...

1112
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,660
Where...

1113
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,040
Where...

1114
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,360
It is now a drug store...

1115
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,980
So it's not empty anymore...

1116
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,700
At least...

1117
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,080
Because it was really depressing walking by it...

1118
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,620
And it just being all boarded up...

1119
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,340
And nothing going on...

1120
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,240
But...

1121
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,780
It's now a drug store...

1122
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,240
So it's a little depressing...

1123
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:21,780
Umm...

1124
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,480
But...

1125
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,120
Yeah...

1126
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,820
And by drug store I mean like...

1127
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,540
You can get medicine...

1128
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,780
And things...

1129
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,740
I love drugs!

1130
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,020
Legal or illegal?

1131
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,800
I'm sorry...

1132
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:39,760
Yeah...

1133
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,180
I'm a drug addict now...

1134
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,260
There's one right over here!

1135
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,160
There's a Matsukiyo!

1136
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,340
Right there!

1137
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,300
You don't need another drug store...

1138
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,980
I'm sorry...

1139
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,640
Over here...

1140
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,960
Maybe...

1141
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,520
Hold on...

1142
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,060
Maybe if I go out a little bit more...

1143
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,840
We transported back to 2013!

1144
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,180
Oh my gosh!

1145
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,680
You can see it...

1146
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,420
It was so...

1147
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,680
Yes!

1148
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,540
Wait...

1149
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:15,920
Yes!

1150
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,140
Yes!

1151
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,680
I was like...

1152
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,700
Wait, where am I right now?

1153
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,640
We transported...

1154
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,120
Wait, see more dates...

1155
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,300
July 2022...

1156
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,020
There we go...

1157
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,240
Sorry, I'm trying to keep this as updated as possible for now...

1158
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:32,900
So that way...

1159
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,840
I can give a more authentic...

1160
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,880
A more accurate tour, right?

1161
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,300
Time travel...

1162
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,920
Can you see the Sega building from here?

1163
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,040
You mean the GIGO?

1164
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,260
Yes...

1165
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,060
Yeah, the GIGO is right there...

1166
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,200
Down here...

1167
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,340
Now we're in 2017!

1168
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,660
Now we're in 2015!

1169
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,300
We're back in 2015!

1170
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,280
Can I change the date again?

1171
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:07,900
Oh wait!

1172
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,940
We have September 2023!

1173
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,240
Oh my gosh, so recent!

1174
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,380
You have another GIGO down here...

1175
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,160
You have a LAMTARO here...

1176
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,200
Which is like...

1177
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,420
Part Yabai store...

1178
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,520
Part...

1179
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,480
Um...

1180
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,460
Part...

1181
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,780
Like other stuff...

1182
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,420
It's just like a variety of stuff...

1183
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,320
But it's a little...

1184
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,380
Little Yabai...

1185
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,640
At the LAMTARO...

1186
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,320
Very interesting at the top floors...

1187
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,320
But yeah, it's a little...

1188
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,060
But yeah, it's a little...

1189
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,940
All stores Yabai...

1190
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,400
Part Yabai...

1191
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,140
Maybe mostly Yabai...

1192
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,700
Maybe mostly Yabai...

1193
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,740
But what I wanted to point out here was the Pepper Lunch...

1194
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,960
Because I really like Pepper Lunch...

1195
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,940
Pepper Lunch...

1196
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,280
Right here...

1197
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,180
Pepper Lunch...

1198
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:05,760
Pepper Lunch...

1199
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,700
This used to be the only Pepper Lunch in Akiba...

1200
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,920
But they recently...

1201
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,740
Also opened another one...

1202
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,100
All the way...

1203
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,180
Down there...

1204
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,180
But it's much bigger...

1205
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,220
This one is really small...

1206
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,080
So if you're craving Pepper Lunch...

1207
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,960
Pepper Ranch...

1208
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,500
Pepper Ranch...

1209
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,440
What does it add here?

1210
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,480
I don't recognize it though...

1211
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,080
I'm such a fake fan...

1212
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,940
My gosh...

1213
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,780
Sorry, I don't know anything...

1214
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,180
I don't even know Akiba...

1215
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,160
Oh, it's both...

1216
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,520
Oh, it's Bochy the Rock...

1217
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,500
I obviously know Bochy...

1218
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,660
Wait, you were being serious...

1219
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,260
I thought you were kidding and being like...

1220
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,700
What are you talking about?

1221
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,400
That's Bochy the Rock, obviously...

1222
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,800
Actually, this is your lie in April...

1223
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,620
There's actual Bochy...

1224
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,320
And the gamers...

1225
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,840
I like this place...

1226
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,700
It turned into a...

1227
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,300
That's right...

1228
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,540
I forgot it turned into a trading card place...

1229
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,340
But it used to be kind of like a pop-up store...

1230
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,720
And sometimes there would be like...

1231
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,600
There's another one...

1232
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,960
There's another place that does this in Akiba...

1233
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,420
But it...

1234
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,320
Used to be like...

1235
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,940
One time it was a pop-up store for like...

1236
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,080
Seiyuu branded headphones...

1237
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,400
So like if you're just like...

1238
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,020
Oh, I want Ogura Yui to speak in my ear...

1239
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,300
You can...

1240
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,680
You could get that...

1241
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,160
But there's another place like that...

1242
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,920
Um...

1243
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,720
Last time I went...

1244
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,480
They were selling iCuts...

1245
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,060
Headphones...

1246
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,380
But now it's trading card...

1247
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,040
Okay...

1248
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,970
I don't even think I'm ready to talk about it...

1249
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,290
Over here...

1250
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,910
Hey, get out of my way...

1251
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,410
Get out of my way...

1252
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:10,970
I'm so too...

1253
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,710
Imagine an anime about someone trapped in Akiba...

1254
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,090
Who keeps getting transported to different ears as they walk around...

1255
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,010
That would be actually so awesome...

1256
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,140
Right here is Mansei-bashi...

1257
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,950
Mansei-bashi bridge...

1258
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,250
Which is just...

1259
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,170
Iconic bridge in Akiba...

1260
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,350
Um...

1261
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,390
You have the train that runs here...

1262
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,510
Um, you have some restaurants here...

1263
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:34,930
Um, you have just a really beautiful view...

1264
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,850
Of Akiba here...

1265
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,290
Uh...

1266
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:44,630
This used to be a famous... famous katsu place, but it's now...

1267
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:52,550
Not just katsu, like a famous... it's just like a famous... how do I say?

1268
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:52,910
Meat?

1269
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:57,130
I'm so depressed about it.

1270
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:12,490
But... I believe they opened like a... not... I mean obviously this doesn't exist anymore, but they opened a smaller scale store with sandwiches.

1271
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,630
From what I understand.

1272
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,030
So...

1273
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:22,330
Yeah...

1274
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:24,510
Had the meats.

1275
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,560
They did have katsu sando though.

1276
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,540
They did have like...

1277
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,240
Some... they had like a store down here where you could get some stuff and then the restaurant obviously.

1278
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,380
Akiba is changing.

1279
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,140
But also, so much of Akiba is still the same.

1280
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,020
So... it's not so bad.

1281
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,600
It's bad, but not so bad.

1282
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,660
Which way should we go down?

1283
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,000
Do I want to go down Chuo Dori first or...

1284
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,220
No, we can go down here.

1285
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,460
So over here...

1286
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,060
Right here is where you find the Grand Blue Fantasy Cafe.

1287
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,640
It's... if you see the Pase La... wait.

1288
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,040
You can't really... hold on.

1289
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,300
I think I showed it earlier.

1290
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,980
You can see it from over here too.

1291
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,340
Come on, tree!

1292
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,420
Come on, tree!

1293
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,580
Here, here, here.

1294
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,580
The Pase La...

1295
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,540
The Pase La Resort?

1296
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,200
This is also...

1297
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,420
Not just a pop-up.

1298
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,880
But I believe they also do other cafe pop-ups as well.

1299
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,180
Like one time they had... Oh, here you can see... What is that?

1300
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,260
Is

1301
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,500
that Kochi Usa?

1302
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,720
Am I dumb?

1303
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,220
It is Kochi Usa?

1304
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:06,900
Okay, okay.

1305
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,680
I was like, wait.

1306
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:08,760
I don't want to be...

1307
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,760
I don't want to say it and be wrong.

1308
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,640
But yeah, they do other pop-ups in here.

1309
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,360
It's definitely worth checking out what they're doing.

1310
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,780
Because I believe also this is the Monster Hunter place too.

1311
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,460
So there's like... there's a lot going on here all the time.

1312
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:29,020
So it's the Monster Hunter Cafe, the Grand Blue Cafe, and then what other pop-up cafes as well.

1313
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:29,680
Oh, see.

1314
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,300
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1315
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,500
Monster Hunter on the third floor.

1316
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,840
So yes.

1317
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,840
There's also...

1318
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,780
Pasella is a karaoke place.

1319
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,820
It's like a chain.

1320
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,940
A chain karaoke one.

1321
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,500
And it's not...

1322
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,540
This isn't even the only one in Akiba.

1323
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,720
But they are known for their toast boxes.

1324
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,600
These.

1325
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,020
They're so yummy.

1326
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,120
They're so yummy.

1327
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:54,860
So, so good.

1328
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,940
The Toast Cafe.

1329
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:56,680
Yeah, yeah.

1330
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,180
You can get them.

1331
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,060
You can order them while you're like...

1332
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,420
While you're singing.

1333
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,120
But this is not just...

1334
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,820
It says like famous dessert in Akiba.

1335
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:07,740
That's a lie.

1336
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,020
You can get the honey toast at any Pasella.

1337
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,020
Maybe they do specialized ones here.

1338
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,360
But like you can get the honey toast anywhere.

1339
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,040
And what it is, is it's like...

1340
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,620
It's...

1341
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,180
It's like four pieces of toast that make a box.

1342
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:31,420
And then they put like ice cream and fruit and stuff inside the box.

1343
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,520
Inside the...

1344
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,380
Inside the toast.

1345
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,360
So it's really yummy.

1346
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,280
And...

1347
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,860
Also here is a theater called Parms.

1348
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,560
Which is a...

1349
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,440
Event...

1350
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,120
It's basically just a live...

1351
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,740
It's like a theater.

1352
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,840
Not a live house.

1353
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,400
It's a theater.

1354
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,480
Which...

1355
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,360
This group called Kamen Joshi.

1356
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,160
They play there every day.

1357
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,460
So if you wanna go see some idols.

1358
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,440
And you're just like...

1359
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,220
Well...

1360
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,400
I don't know where to go.

1361
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,480
You can always come here.

1362
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,040
And they will be doing a live show.

1363
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,480
So it's pretty fun.

1364
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,160
Every day.

1365
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,680
This is some collab cafe.

1366
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,140
But I can't read it.

1367
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,700
I have no idea what...

1368
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,000
E...

1369
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,360
E...

1370
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,060
Eor...

1371
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,400
Eorzia?

1372
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,320
Eorzia?

1373
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,300
I can't read it.

1374
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,160
I saw it down here too.

1375
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:28,980
Cafe...

1376
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,160
All I can see is cafe.

1377
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,880
A Final Fantasy XIV...

1378
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,900
Eorzia's Final Fantasy XIV...

1379
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,960
Thanks guys.

1380
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,440
Oh my gosh.

1381
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,100
How...

1382
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,360
She's not even qualified to give this tour.

1383
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,140
Why is she even giving us the tour right now?

1384
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,640
She doesn't even know...

1385
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,700
She doesn't even go here.

1386
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,280
If you come down this way a little bit too.

1387
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,460
This is crazy.

1388
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,500
If you are a fan...

1389
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:02,520
Whoa...

1390
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,020
If you are a fan of Love Live!

1391
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,960
Which may be these guys are too.

1392
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,580
This is actually...

1393
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,060
One of the parks that they visit in Love Live.

1394
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,380
Why are there such...

1395
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,040
Why are there?

1396
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,780
Why is there such a big group of...

1397
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,880
I say park, but there's like just a couple benches in here.

1398
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,420
Why is there...

1399
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,840
Why is there such a big group of people?

1400
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:24,940
People!

1401
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,820
What's going on?

1402
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,620
Those are definitely love livers.

1403
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,940
It almost looks like this guy has some anime...

1404
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,080
Maybe it's Oshii.

1405
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,920
When was this taken?

1406
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,680
September 2023?

1407
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,540
If you were there in September 2023, I'm so...

1408
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,440
Is that you?

1409
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,700
I'm just so... What is going on?

1410
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,440
I'm so curious.

1411
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,060
In store meow.

1412
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,280
Let's see.

1413
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,660
I'm trying to decide how I want to go about this.

1414
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,040
There's some other stuff back there.

1415
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,320
I know that's like the most vague phrasing ever.

1416
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,320
We won't go down this street yet.

1417
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,680
Let's go back to Chuo Dori.

1418
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,480
Wasn't one where Nico's apartment got torn down and made into a park?

1419
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,380
No!

1420
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,540
This park was already there.

1421
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,800
They sit in it in Love Live!

1422
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,520
In that park.

1423
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,000
Like in the original Love Live!

1424
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:00,240
But I don't actually know where Nico's apartment was.

1425
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,720
I'll be honest.

1426
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,720
I actually don't know.

1427
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,660
Yay!

1428
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,420
Akihabara!

1429
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:11,820
Akihabara.

1430
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,600
This main street here...

1431
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,100
This street that goes down here is called Chuo Dori.

1432
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:21,000
Like I said, the main street.

1433
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,020
So if we go down a little here...

1434
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,820
This is where we started.

1435
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,520
I'm just gonna go down a little bit.

1436
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,340
This is Akiba station down here.

1437
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,660
Just to get you a little bit oriented.

1438
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,180
There's that hotel.

1439
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,440
There's Radio Kaikan.

1440
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,220
There's gamers.

1441
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,740
There's the main dream in.

1442
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:40,820
So...

1443
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,900
This is all that.

1444
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,780
If you turn around here...

1445
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,200
You have...

1446
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,340
You have...

1447
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,740
Let me move that a little bit.

1448
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,240
You have Onoden.

1449
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,020
Which is like a famous...

1450
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,920
Onoden has been here forever as well in Akihabara.

1451
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:06,620
It's one of those like staple electronic stores that has been here forever.

1452
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:07,840
And...

1453
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:09,880
But...

1454
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,260
In the Onoden building...

1455
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,880
There's a book off.

1456
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:14,900
Oh no, sorry.

1457
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,140
The book off is the one that I...

1458
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:19,280
Pointed out earlier.

1459
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,680
There is...

1460
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,640
Oh my gosh.

1461
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,660
There is a cos-pa.

1462
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:26,940
There is...

1463
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,780
There is a cosplay store.

1464
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,600
There is...

1465
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,360
What else is there?

1466
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,220
I'm trying to remember.

1467
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,280
I think this is where...

1468
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,820
I think it was a pop-up store though.

1469
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,760
I couldn't remember.

1470
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,900
But they did have like a blue archive.

1471
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:53,240
No.

1472
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:53,880
Not a blue archive.

1473
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,780
I'm thinking of somewhere else.

1474
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,320
They had a...

1475
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,860
They had just like a general doujin artist pop-up.

1476
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,660
Which I didn't get to go to.

1477
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,300
I was busy.

1478
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:06,160
I was in a hurry.

1479
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,020
And I didn't get to go.

1480
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,360
Is that...

1481
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,120
Touhou?

1482
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:10,600
Yes.

1483
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,840
But there's like a Touhou corner...

1484
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,440
In the store.

1485
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:18,700
In the store.

1486
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:18,800
In the store.

1487
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,160
I'm the worst at describing stuff.

1488
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,100
One thing I do want to point out here.

1489
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,740
That I like to come here for though.

1490
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:25,960
Is the Cure Maid Cafe.

1491
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,160
Which if you're wanting a maid cafe.

1492
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,740
That's not like your super high energy maid cafe.

1493
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,700
Just one...

1494
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,060
It doesn't even have a table charge.

1495
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,580
It's very relaxed and chill.

1496
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,800
It's the Cure Maid Cafe.

1497
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:45,840
They are always doing a collaboration with some sort of anime or game.

1498
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:47,380
So...

1499
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,640
Before you go, I would check the schedule.

1500
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,380
Because...

1501
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,100
You know...

1502
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:51,720
Something...

1503
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:52,420
Stop!

1504
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,740
Stop looking over here!

1505
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,220
Stop!

1506
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,180
Stop looking over here!

1507
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,260
Stop!

1508
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:01,980
Stop looking!

1509
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:03,260
No, no, no!

1510
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,640
Take us to B1.

1511
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:10,940
What?

1512
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:11,860
What?

1513
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,440
You'll never go to the second floor!

1514
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,320
You'll never go!

1515
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:17,600
You'll never go there!

1516
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,260
Why do you think it's only one floor and men's goods is two floors?

1517
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,810
Actually, I'll also never go there.

1518
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:37,430
Because I'm not allowed, I think.

1519
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:41,750
I don't think I'm allowed on these floors.

1520
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:45,210
I think it's only for guys to go to.

1521
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:48,170
Which makes me even more curious.

1522
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,170
I want to go even more now.

1523
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,430
Costume lingerie?

1524
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,910
Oh, yeah.

1525
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,010
I mean, you can get that at like Don Quixote too and stuff like...

1526
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:00,310
They sometimes sell like really sexy costumes and...

1527
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:03,010
I'll be honest.

1528
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,770
I've been in M's but I've never been in Love Mercy because I'm shy.

1529
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:09,710
I've been in M's before.

1530
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:11,510
Love Mercy has been here forever.

1531
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:16,370
It's also like one of those stores that's just been here in Akiba forever but...

1532
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:18,170
I've never gone because I'm...

1533
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:18,950
I'm shy.

1534
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,490
Okay?

1535
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,170
I'm shy.

1536
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,950
But I went to M's.

1537
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:23,430
I don't know.

1538
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,730
Maybe because I went with some friends.

1539
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:29,610
Love Mercy is the same as M's though.

1540
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,230
Yeah, but I went with friends before.

1541
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:35,250
Anyways, let me continue my wholesome talking about the Cure Maid Cafe.

1542
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:36,370
Oh, this is it.

1543
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:36,590
Right here.

1544
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,490
Basically, you'll go up the escalator a couple times.

1545
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:41,370
A couple floors.

1546
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:45,410
And you'll arrive on one floor and...

1547
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:48,370
Thank you.

1548
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:50,110
What do you mean cute?

1549
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:53,110
What do you mean?

1550
01:02:58,730 --> 01:02:59,410
The?

1551
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,390
What do you mean?

1552
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,140
The floor with the...

1553
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,080
With the maid cafe has...

1554
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,060
Stop it!

1555
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,000
It has... Stop it right now!

1556
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:39,090
Do you want this tour or not?

1557
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:40,690
Huh?

1558
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:41,990
Do you want this tour or not?

1559
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:43,670
Oh my god.

1560
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:44,650
Oh my god.

1561
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:46,970
Thank you for that good suba!

1562
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,790
Loving the updated Akiba tour.

1563
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:52,630
Your original stream was what got me hooked on your channel in the first place.

1564
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:53,250
Glad you're back.

1565
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:53,910
Thank you!

1566
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:56,130
I hope one day I could...

1567
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:59,230
Well, you know, not myself walking around in Akiba.

1568
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:02,150
But if someone walked around, Akiba went for me.

1569
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:05,310
And I got to talk about it and stuff on stream.

1570
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:07,070
I hope one day I can do something like that.

1571
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:07,770
It'd be really fun.

1572
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:08,830
I think.

1573
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:11,370
Oh, what was I saying?

1574
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:12,930
Oh!

1575
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:13,970
You go here!

1576
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,430
On your... You go up the escalator a couple floors.

1577
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:21,490
In front of you, on the right, will be Kiramei Cafe.

1578
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,610
Across from it will be the Kazpa.

1579
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:26,610
To the left of it will be an extension of the Kazpa.

1580
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:28,990
It's like a different store also.

1581
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:29,950
It's kind of confusing.

1582
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:33,430
And through there is also the cosplay store.

1583
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,370
Let's get out of here!

1584
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,140
Mina Lenski Cafe!

1585
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:47,160
Yes!

1586
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,260
Oh, yes!

1587
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,820
Thank you!

1588
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,100
Thank you!

1589
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,020
Yes, this cafe...

1590
01:04:54,020 --> 01:05:00,020
The cafe... Kir Cafe is the cafe that Kotori worked at in Love Live!

1591
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,000
So it's also a...

1592
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,360
You can also get like...

1593
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,540
Love Live...

1594
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,680
Kir Made Goods...

1595
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,540
There as well.

1596
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:09,580
Wolfman!

1597
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:10,620
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

1598
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,180
Thank you!

1599
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,080
Chat broke?

1600
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,640
Yeah, you did break!

1601
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,750
You helped inspire me to push through and get my game on Steam!

1602
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:28,450
Oh my gosh!

1603
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:31,370
Entire journey has been heckin' awesome and I love popping into streams!

1604
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:32,090
Fight me!

1605
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,070
Okay, I'll fight you!

1606
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:39,250
Congrats!

1607
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,210
I'm broken...

1608
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:46,090
Let's see...

1609
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:47,850
Matsukiyo is a chain.

1610
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:49,410
It's nothing special.

1611
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,290
It's not Akiba special or anything.

1612
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,490
It's just a drugstore.

1613
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,190
And you can get skincare there.

1614
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,690
Here's like if you're looking for...

1615
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:00,890
Oh, I didn't point them out over there either.

1616
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:04,210
But if you're looking for some of like those small electronic stores...

1617
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,430
That are like very, you know...

1618
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:09,550
Like original Akihabara.

1619
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:10,690
Lots in there.

1620
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:14,770
One thing, one place I do want to point out over here...

1621
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,590
As you can see from the sign...

1622
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:20,070
This is a maid cafe I really like.

1623
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,430
The Isekai Maid Cafe.

1624
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:23,650
I like this cosplayer.

1625
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,490
Her name is Shiyo.

1626
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:25,450
She's very cute.

1627
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:28,630
AskGosu!

1628
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:30,270
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

1629
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:30,810
Thank you!

1630
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,910
But if you want to go to the...

1631
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,370
Isekai Maid Cafe...

1632
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:35,510
The entrance is right here.

1633
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:38,650
And it's just right here.

1634
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:39,650
On the second floor.

1635
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:40,450
Right here.

1636
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:42,010
So...

1637
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:44,010
Yeah, it's on the second floor.

1638
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:45,310
It's very cute.

1639
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,190
I like the theme there.

1640
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:49,870
Oh, oh wait!

1641
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:50,510
Yeah, here they are.

1642
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:51,210
The...

1643
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:54,730
The other electronic stores and stuff like that.

1644
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,990
Lots in this building in general.

1645
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:00,990
So...

1646
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:01,810
Um...

1647
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:03,710
Oh my gosh, so cute!

1648
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:05,430
The yuri yuri!

1649
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,050
So cute!

1650
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,170
This is the other side of Akiba Station.

1651
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:11,650
So if you come out the other way...

1652
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:12,750
Can we walk this way?

1653
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:13,510
Woah, woah, woah.

1654
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,370
For real?

1655
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,810
Can we walk this way for real?

1656
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,750
Will it let us in?

1657
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,170
Will we be transported to night time?

1658
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:23,490
With all the guys standing around?

1659
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:25,530
Okay, we're going.

1660
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:26,750
Wait, is it...

1661
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,110
It's Idol Master now?

1662
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:28,850
Hahaha!

1663
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:31,550
And...

1664
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:32,710
La plus...

1665
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:34,030
La plus sama?

1666
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:34,770
What is that?

1667
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:35,210
Um...

1668
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,010
Is it like...

1669
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:38,250
Shadowverse or something?

1670
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:38,970
What is that?

1671
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:40,850
Oh...

1672
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:42,390
Yes it is.

1673
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:43,050
Hahaha!

1674
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:46,190
Um...

1675
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,430
What's so funny is...

1676
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,850
Um...

1677
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:48,730
So yeah, see?

1678
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:49,730
We're back at Akiba Station!

1679
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:50,290
Woohoo!

1680
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:51,430
It's so funny.

1681
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:52,110
These...

1682
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,750
These advertisements for like...

1683
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,250
Oh gosh.

1684
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,490
Every time that I've gone back to Akiba...

1685
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:00,430
There are Arknights here but...

1686
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:00,810
Um...

1687
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:04,330
Right now, they're usually Blue Archive advertisements so...

1688
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:08,130
I guess...

1689
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:10,830
I guess Blue Archive took over.

1690
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,740
But this is the other side.

1691
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,140
Oh, remember when we were trying to go to school?

1692
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,620
This is...

1693
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,180
The UDX building.

1694
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,760
It's the school that the girls...

1695
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,620
The rival girls go to in Love Live.

1696
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,260
There's a bunch of restaurants and stuff in there.

1697
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,040
Um...

1698
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,540
Over here is the Tamashii Nation store which...

1699
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:41,480
I recommend checking out 100% because they sometimes...

1700
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,180
Um...

1701
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,520
Although they'll have like...

1702
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,600
Um...

1703
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,800
How do I describe it?

1704
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,360
It's not like a pop-up.

1705
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:48,360
It's like almost...

1706
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,480
It almost feels like a museum.

1707
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,720
Like they'll have like a...

1708
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,260
Like sometimes it'll be...

1709
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,240
Um...

1710
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,360
Like an exhibit of...

1711
01:08:59,220 --> 01:08:59,820
Macross.

1712
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,100
And it'll show like a bunch of their old Macross figures and...

1713
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:04,660
The...

1714
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:04,800
The...

1715
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,540
The...

1716
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,500
Um...

1717
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,940
Timeline of Macross and stuff like that.

1718
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:10,340
Um...

1719
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,000
And things like that.

1720
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,120
So...

1721
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,440
Um...

1722
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,600
They'll have like...

1723
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,960
Like one time I went and there was the...

1724
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,200
Um...

1725
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,380
That costume that guy wears.

1726
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,120
I can't remember anything today.

1727
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,260
I'm so sorry, guys.

1728
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,640
And it's like...

1729
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,300
It's like the black straps across his body.

1730
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,500
Um...

1731
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,560
Rip the Gundam Cafe.

1732
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:36,880
Yeah.

1733
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,060
I know.

1734
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,780
Unfortunately, the Gundam Cafe and the AKB48 Cafe used to be here.

1735
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,300
They're no longer here.

1736
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,420
It is now the Tamashii Nation store.

1737
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:45,740
Um...

1738
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,240
Hot Limit!

1739
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:49,200
Thank you, Ghost Talker.

1740
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,040
Yes, TM Revolution.

1741
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,660
They had the costume.

1742
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:52,720
Um...

1743
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,880
They had the TM Revolution...

1744
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,740
Um...

1745
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:59,480
Like the Hot Limit song costume there.

1746
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,360
So it was...

1747
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:00,520
Uh...

1748
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,640
I was just like...

1749
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:01,880
Whoa.

1750
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,580
I'm pretty sure I have a...

1751
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,780
A picture somewhere.

1752
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:05,820
There's a coffee.

1753
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:06,940
There's a coffee cafe.

1754
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:07,040
Yeah.

1755
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:11,160
And then, there's also a revolving sushi place that has been here...

1756
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:11,760
Forever.

1757
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,220
Um...

1758
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,280
It's very small.

1759
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,520
Um...

1760
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,880
But if you are, like...

1761
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,400
There's a sushi dough...

1762
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,020
Like...

1763
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,340
Right over here...

1764
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:21,820
Um...

1765
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,560
And a Hamazushi.

1766
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:23,000
Wait.

1767
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,620
Is that still there?

1768
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:24,160
The Hamazushi?

1769
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,200
Actually, I'm not sure.

1770
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,020
I don't remember.

1771
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,860
But if you're wanting a sushi place...

1772
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:31,480
And those...

1773
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:31,820
Um...

1774
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:32,620
The sushi dough...

1775
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,320
And maybe the Hamazushi are busy...

1776
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,880
There's also a sushi place that's a rotating sushi...

1777
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,600
Right there!

1778
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:38,840
So...

1779
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,480
The atre...

1780
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,840
Oh yeah, here... there's the Sushiro.

1781
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,320
It's kinda in the basement, right?

1782
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,820
Oh, wait, where'd it go?

1783
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,560
Is it over here?

1784
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,640
Oh, there it is!

1785
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,140
Yeah, it's in the basement, so...

1786
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,460
Let's go to another drugstore.

1787
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,160
They're everywhere, the drugstores.

1788
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,200
Why are Japanese people...

1789
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,280
Wait...

1790
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,640
Because I'm an otaku.

1791
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,540
Gigo here.

1792
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,460
This one has like...

1793
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,800
I'm pretty sure it's this one.

1794
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:32,400
I don't think the other ones have it as much.

1795
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,180
But this one has like the Gundam.

1796
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,640
Pods, if I remember correctly.

1797
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,140
I don't...

1798
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,900
You can correct me if I'm wrong about that.

1799
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,380
But...

1800
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,540
The Gundam Tide Pods, exactly.

1801
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:54,880
Let's actually go down here.

1802
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,040
Because this is the Gigo I mentioned earlier.

1803
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:58,900
How...

1804
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,960
It is this road, right?

1805
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:03,980
Hold on.

1806
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:04,980
Let me get my bearings.

1807
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:05,220
Yes!

1808
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,120
It's right here.

1809
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,460
It's not open right now.

1810
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,760
But this is where they do...

1811
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,820
You can kind of see it.

1812
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,520
Is that it?

1813
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,140
Actually, no.

1814
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,480
I think that's a reflection of KFC.

1815
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,460
Never mind.

1816
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:20,720
Wait...

1817
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,820
It says KFC.

1818
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,420
But the sign...

1819
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,180
Is it reflecting this one?

1820
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,480
It's reflecting KFC.

1821
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,940
But this is not the KFC.

1822
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,680
That's kind of confusing.

1823
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,760
This is where they do the Taiyaki.

1824
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:37,720
Is what I was trying to say.

1825
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,180
So it's like themed Taiyaki.

1826
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,060
Which is kind of fun.

1827
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,860
So it like...

1828
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,820
I'm trying to think of what it was.

1829
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,360
It's been Love Live before.

1830
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:51,580
It's been...

1831
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,480
One week since you looked at me.

1832
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,540
They have Hololive 5th Gen right now.

1833
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,300
Oh, really?

1834
01:12:59,520 --> 01:12:59,780
Nice.

1835
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,880
Nice, nice.

1836
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,160
Sega's Taiyaki.

1837
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,380
Unfortunately, now it's Gigo's Taiyaki.

1838
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,640
Yes, they did do Sonic before.

1839
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,960
That was the other one I was thinking of.

1840
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,420
So...

1841
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:22,560
You can get some Taiyaki here.

1842
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,040
I remember the Persona 3 one.

1843
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,320
And Beast Ball.

1844
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,600
I don't know if the Vspo...

1845
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,800
The Taiyaki was Vspo.

1846
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,480
But yeah...

1847
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,300
There's an anime...

1848
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:38,100
An anime song cafe here.

1849
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:38,700
Called Guild.

1850
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,800
I know friends that have been.

1851
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,140
I personally have not.

1852
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,160
So I can't tell you how it works.

1853
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,400
There's just hobby shops everywhere.

1854
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,420
I haven't been everywhere.

1855
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,120
So I'm so sorry.

1856
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,940
I'm a fake fan.

1857
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,280
Not qualified to give this tour.

1858
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:56,620
But...

1859
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:02,400
There's actually several anime song cafes and bars in Akiba.

1860
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,420
Another called Alchemist.

1861
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,620
Which is closer to Yodobashi Camera.

1862
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:13,580
Actually.

1863
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,280
That one's Alchemist.

1864
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:19,700
What was the other one?

1865
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,380
It was another one that I also haven't been to before.

1866
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,660
But my friend recommended it.

1867
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:24,800
So I'm gonna go next time.

1868
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,380
I can't remember it though.

1869
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,520
How dare the tour guide has not been into literally every store.

1870
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,160
How dare the tour guide has not been into literally every store.

1871
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:36,740
How dare the tour guide has not been into literally every store.

1872
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,840
Also this Gigo the last time I came.

1873
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,420
It might be new.

1874
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,180
Or it might have been a one time thing.

1875
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,260
But I think they do...

1876
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,700
There's crane games on these floors.

1877
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,320
And then on the top floor there was an event space.

1878
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,340
Where they had a Steins Gate...

1879
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,020
A Steins Gate collab.

1880
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,400
Where they had a Steins Gate collab.

1881
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,200
And they had like little standees.

1882
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,260
And they had exclusive merch.

1883
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:05,240
And I got this super duper cute block calendar.

1884
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:05,580
And I got this super duper cute block calendar.

1885
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:06,740
That I have on my desk now.

1886
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,900
It's so cute.

1887
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:12,300
So it's sad that it's not Sega anymore.

1888
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:12,760
So it's sad that it's not Sega anymore.

1889
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,860
But you know Gigo is doing well.

1890
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,180
And I can appreciate that.

1891
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,880
It feels almost like Sega never left.

1892
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:20,180
Almost.

1893
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,760
Because they're still at it.

1894
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,140
They're still at it.

1895
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,940
Even though it's so sad.

1896
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,580
And there's a KFC here.

1897
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,320
And there's a KFC here.

1898
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,860
If you are craving the Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1899
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:34,520
If you are craving the Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1900
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,280
It's here.

1901
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,180
Here you can get a...

1902
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,580
I was gonna say you can get some...

1903
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,340
I was gonna say you can get some...

1904
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:45,540
Some visual novels here.

1905
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,220
Some visual novels here.

1906
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,360
Lots of visual novels there.

1907
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,120
TV game.

1908
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,440
TV game.

1909
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,420
I love TV game.

1910
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,640
Now this street down here.

1911
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,480
Is what...

1912
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,080
Um...

1913
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,000
My friends and I like to call Nugget Bridge.

1914
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:08,480
Because...

1915
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,820
It is so packed with...

1916
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:12,880
Maids.

1917
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,540
Every night.

1918
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,580
Down this street.

1919
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,320
It's so packed with maids.

1920
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,980
There will be maids...

1921
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,680
Trying to stop you at every...

1922
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,140
At every stop.

1923
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:25,140
They'll be like...

1924
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,240
Do you wanna come to our maid cafe?

1925
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,600
How does a ninja girl maid cafe sound?

1926
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,340
Do you wanna come to our maid?

1927
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:32,420
Right here?

1928
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,360
I don't know if they do it so much anymore.

1929
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,400
But this is where...

1930
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,500
This is where one of the maid dreaming locations is.

1931
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,060
And sometimes the girls will...

1932
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,660
Like I said I don't know if they do it so much anymore.

1933
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:47,460
But they used to come out onto this little...

1934
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:49,880
Onto this little balcony and like...

1935
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,120
Dance and like...

1936
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,440
Kind of try and...

1937
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,020
Entice people from above.

1938
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,380
Like a real angel.

1939
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,660
Ninja maid girls...

1940
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,880
Yeah you get so many different kinds of girls here.

1941
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,260
It's like...

1942
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:06,960
I've seen a military type girl.

1943
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,860
I've seen a ninja girl.

1944
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,460
I've seen...

1945
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,160
My

1946
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:27,990
mind is blank.

1947
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:30,230
Did we find the ninja girl?

1948
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,350
The chubby girl maid cafe yet?

1949
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:32,570
No I'll take you there.

1950
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:33,150
I'll take you there.

1951
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:33,550
Don't worry.

1952
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:34,610
Don't worry.

1953
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:35,370
Patience.

1954
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:36,050
Patience.

1955
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:37,830
Patience.

1956
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:38,290
Patience.

1957
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:43,150
I think...

1958
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:44,590
When I was...

1959
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:46,430
When we watched...

1960
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:50,350
Some time ago we watched...

1961
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:52,090
A couple streams ago we watched the opening...

1962
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:54,490
For the Akiba maid war anime.

1963
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:55,830
I'm pretty sure...

1964
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:57,790
This is what the street that I think it was.

1965
01:17:58,150 --> 01:17:59,010
Cause like I said...

1966
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:03,330
I think this is the one that it's supposed to be.

1967
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:05,390
I think this is the one that it's supposed to be.

1968
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:06,030
I might be wrong though.

1969
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:07,210
But I think this is the one.

1970
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:10,170
I was like...

1971
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:10,690
Wait a second.

1972
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:16,010
But also Melon Books!

1973
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:16,710
But also Melon Books!

1974
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,310
On Melon Books the entrance is actually...

1975
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:19,930
On the other side.

1976
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:21,650
You can go through...

1977
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:22,230
This is an arcade.

1978
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:23,470
You can cut through it.

1979
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,290
Or you can just walk around here.

1980
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:26,430
I'll show you.

1981
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:27,810
But Akiba...

1982
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:29,490
Akiba are also...

1983
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:30,730
All over Akiba.

1984
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:33,070
They're electronic stores.

1985
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,990
They have really cheap electronic stuff.

1986
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:37,690
You can see the balcony here.

1987
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,570
It's very cute.

1988
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:41,310
And here we have a Kotobukiya.

1989
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:42,790
Yahoo!

1990
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:45,170
Kotobukiya is so...

1991
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,910
So great.

1992
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:48,610
Why is everything closed?

1993
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:50,570
How early did they film this?

1994
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,730
I wonder.

1995
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:53,770
Um...

1996
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:57,110
The Kotobukiya on the first floor.

1997
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:57,990
You can get like...

1998
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,690
Final Fantasy stuff.

1999
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,090
Um...

2000
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:02,930
There's a little bit of Hololive stuff.

2001
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:05,250
There's a big Nijisanji section.

2002
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,990
On the second floor there's...

2003
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,650
What I really love about Kotobukiya...

2004
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:11,830
Is getting the stuff for storing my figures.

2005
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:13,330
Um...

2006
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:15,370
It's like...

2007
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:15,930
Oh yeah!

2008
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,010
The Tales of stuff.

2009
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:19,010
Though the Tales of...

2010
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:21,430
They used to have a really dedicated Tales of section.

2011
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:23,550
I don't think that is around anymore.

2012
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:25,070
Um...

2013
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,370
All the Vtuber stuff on the third floor now.

2014
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:29,030
Oh really?

2015
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:30,470
That must have been...

2016
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:32,630
Actually I don't think I went the last time I...

2017
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:33,970
Oh yeah there...

2018
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,650
Remember how I said places in Akiba...

2019
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:39,530
Or places in Japan open late and close early?

2020
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,190
Opens at 12?

2021
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:43,490
Opens at 12?

2022
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,310
And then opens...

2023
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:47,370
I mean closes...

2024
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,110
Probably at like 7.

2025
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,270
Gosh it's so early.

2026
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:52,950
It opens so late.

2027
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:54,470
Hololive on the top floor.

2028
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,350
Thanks for letting me know.

2029
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:03,050
It drives me mad.

2030
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:03,770
Me too.

2031
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,490
It's so frustrating.

2032
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:09,570
Because of course...

2033
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:11,370
You're wanting to make the most out of your day.

2034
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,310
And visit the most places as possible.

2035
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:15,150
But it kind of makes it hard...

2036
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:16,490
When they don't open until noon.

2037
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:18,790
Um...

2038
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:20,030
But yeah.

2039
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:21,610
I like to get the stuff...

2040
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:22,250
Like um...

2041
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:25,590
Like they have the standees for your figures.

2042
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,570
They have like um...

2043
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:29,970
Acrylic boxes and stuff.

2044
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:30,990
For storing your figures.

2045
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:32,070
They got a lot of stuff in here.

2046
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:32,950
I really like it.

2047
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:36,390
They got stuff for model kits and everything like that.

2048
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:37,210
Paints and...

2049
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:38,890
I mean they're not the only place of course.

2050
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:39,710
Oh excuse me.

2051
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,970
They're not the only place of course but um...

2052
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,210
Sorry just going back to the main road real quick.

2053
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,430
If you go in through here.

2054
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,170
This is where Melon Books is.

2055
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:49,130
Um...

2056
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:51,370
You'll pass some crane games on the right.

2057
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:52,910
And there's a couple of gacha...

2058
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:56,050
Gachapon that always steal your money.

2059
01:20:58,010 --> 01:20:58,790
Melon Books!

2060
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:00,950
Fix your gachapon please!

2061
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,070
I had to... I tried.

2062
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:05,150
Oh my god I tried helping some poor guy.

2063
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:06,350
Who...

2064
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:09,750
Who got his money stuck in the gachapon.

2065
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:11,050
And...

2066
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:14,430
It happened to me and my friends some time ago too.

2067
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:16,010
And like we kind of like just...

2068
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:16,890
BAM!

2069
01:21:16,890 --> 01:21:17,230
BAM!

2070
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:17,570
BAM!

2071
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:18,950
On the gacha a little bit.

2072
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:20,190
Just a little bit.

2073
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:23,110
Um and it eventually came out.

2074
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,790
And they're not like super cheap either.

2075
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:26,890
They're like 400 yen.

2076
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,890
They were like some blue archive uh...

2077
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:31,930
Keychain like little acrylic...

2078
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,710
Acrylic keys and I was just like...

2079
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:34,710
I was like trying to help the guy.

2080
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:35,510
I was just like...

2081
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:37,570
Uh... I was like...

2082
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:38,610
Here let me try.

2083
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,810
This thing has eaten my money before too.

2084
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:41,510
And I was like...

2085
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:42,730
I was like...

2086
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:43,670
But it was like...

2087
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,390
When it happened to me before it was kind of late at night.

2088
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:48,570
So there weren't so many people around.

2089
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:49,810
So we were like...

2090
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,410
Okay with like kind of...

2091
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:52,790
Hitting the...

2092
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:56,790
Maybe it's broken because so many people keep hitting it.

2093
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:57,450
Because it keeps...

2094
01:21:57,450 --> 01:21:59,050
Eating their money!

2095
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:02,410
But anyway do not use the gachapon there.

2096
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:04,230
Because it's actual gacha.

2097
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:06,190
You might just get nothing.

2098
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:07,530
So...

2099
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,670
Don't do it!

2100
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:11,330
Even if you...

2101
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:13,730
See the blue archive or the genshin impact.

2102
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:15,150
Don't do it!

2103
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:19,970
In the end I couldn't even help the guy.

2104
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:21,110
I was like I'm so sorry.

2105
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:23,410
I can't get it out.

2106
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,390
He was like it's okay.

2107
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:30,230
But I really tried to help him out.

2108
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:31,530
Sorry guy.

2109
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:34,750
Nah I'd still do it.

2110
01:22:36,570 --> 01:22:37,810
Last order films.

2111
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:38,970
Thank you for the 20 gifts.

2112
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:39,810
Thank you.

2113
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:45,750
But yeah.

2114
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,630
So if you're tempted.

2115
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:49,790
I recommend not to be tempted.

2116
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:51,510
Don't even look that way.

2117
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:54,710
Sorry but we keep skipping some stuff.

2118
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,870
Because I'm going everywhere.

2119
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,230
This is the gigo.

2120
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:58,670
Just to get you guys up to speed.

2121
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,070
There's the isekai maid cafe.

2122
01:23:00,490 --> 01:23:02,370
Over there is the train station.

2123
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,650
There's an arcade here.

2124
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,770
Mansei-bashi bridge down there.

2125
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:11,070
Yeah.

2126
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:13,210
Ramen shop here.

2127
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:17,330
More game store stuff here.

2128
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,430
Another tamashii nation store here.

2129
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:23,650
It's smaller.

2130
01:23:23,930 --> 01:23:26,810
I just recommend going to the tamashii nation's bigger place.

2131
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:28,230
This place is always.

2132
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,170
There's always so many.

2133
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:31,550
This is one of those like stores that.

2134
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:32,830
Like the tour.

2135
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:34,390
The foreigner tour groups.

2136
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:34,630
You know.

2137
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,590
Just go on.

2138
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:36,530
And so like.

2139
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:39,090
There's always so many people.

2140
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:40,990
Because they meet up here you know.

2141
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,990
Yeah it's a tourist trap.

2142
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:44,950
It's one of those tourist traps that.

2143
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:46,710
Somehow made it through the pandemic.

2144
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,120
But yeah.

2145
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,520
So if you go through here.

2146
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,980
Oh wait it's open now.

2147
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,740
Oh you can see.

2148
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,620
If you go here.

2149
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,060
Like I said the gachapon will be on the right.

2150
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:10,940
There will be a stairs down.

2151
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,020
Into melon books.

2152
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,940
And then there's some stairs up into.

2153
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,520
The uh.

2154
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:19,560
Into.

2155
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:22,580
The arcade that is right here.

2156
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:23,520
So it's all connected.

2157
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,260
It's kind of nice.

2158
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:26,620
Hey.

2159
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,420
Why are we saying hey?

2160
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:30,140
Hey.

2161
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,980
Thank you for the pink.

2162
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:35,680
Thank you.

2163
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,340
Thank you.

2164
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:39,340
Oh.

2165
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:41,420
Hey.

2166
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:46,540
Hey.

2167
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:51,720
Pour one out for me.

2168
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,060
I found the Namco Noir clone arcade cabinet.

2169
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,280
At an amazing price locally.

2170
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,080
But I measured it and it won't fit through my door.

2171
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:00,460
Time to get rid of the door.

2172
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,280
I don't know what else to tell you.

2173
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,900
Time to get rid of the door.

2174
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:07,760
Mmm.

2175
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:09,500
Yum.

2176
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,320
Here's Akiba Culture Zone.

2177
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,060
But also.

2178
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,260
Someone mentioned it earlier.

2179
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,100
Here's Super Potato.

2180
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:18,840
The.

2181
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,140
It's like you know.

2182
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,180
One of the.

2183
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:26,980
It was the retro store until it kind of like got.

2184
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,640
It's still fun to visit though.

2185
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:29,020
You know.

2186
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,220
Even though some things become like a little overrun.

2187
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,460
They're still very fun to visit.

2188
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:36,140
You know it's still fun to see the history.

2189
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,340
But if you're going.

2190
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,420
Be prepared.

2191
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,320
Because the stairs are very steep.

2192
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:42,540
And very small.

2193
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,000
And inside the store too.

2194
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,260
I mean inside of a lot of stores in Japan.

2195
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:50,220
It's just very very very jam packed.

2196
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:50,700
And crowded.

2197
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,140
Like even when there's not a lot of people.

2198
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,480
It's just so.

2199
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,480
It's so tiny in there.

2200
01:25:58,580 --> 01:25:59,100
Um.

2201
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,860
But on the third.

2202
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:03,840
Floor?

2203
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,040
Third floor?

2204
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:06,620
Fourth floor?

2205
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:09,700
Is where they have Snake.

2206
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,860
And I go there every time.

2207
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:12,700
I'm back in Japan.

2208
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,020
And I take a picture with him.

2209
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,180
I take a picture with Snake.

2210
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,300
Every time.

2211
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,620
I often go there to buy candy.

2212
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,260
Is Snake for sale?

2213
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:29,760
No.

2214
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,040
So sad.

2215
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:31,620
He's not.

2216
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,580
I never even noticed the candy.

2217
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,040
I just go there to see Snake.

2218
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:41,300
Cute.

2219
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,180
Candy.

2220
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:44,940
Here is.

2221
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:46,020
Akiba.

2222
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:47,580
Wait.

2223
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,640
What date is it?

2224
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,080
Wait a second.

2225
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,160
2022?

2226
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,100
But Backstage Pass was already.

2227
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,760
Backstage Pass was already closed by then.

2228
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,740
Maybe they just didn't get rid of the sign.

2229
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,520
This is Akiba Culture Zone.

2230
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:05,380
Which.

2231
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:06,760
I'll show you from the back here.

2232
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,580
Real quick.

2233
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,900
They have a ton of stores in here.

2234
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,880
This is where all the maids will try to bombard you.

2235
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,980
Hey come to my cafe.

2236
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,120
Hey how does this cafe sound?

2237
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,600
Hey how does that cafe sound?

2238
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:25,820
Trying to get a good view of Culture Zone real quick.

2239
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,120
Hold on.

2240
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:28,760
Maybe here?

2241
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,640
This is good.

2242
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,440
Hahaha.

2243
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:34,300
Um.

2244
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:36,520
So Culture Zone.

2245
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,180
Is this big building.

2246
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,060
It's really awesome.

2247
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:40,720
Um.

2248
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:43,640
The first floor is Dashinban.

2249
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,700
Oh no sorry.

2250
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,520
I think the first floor is also Dashinban though.

2251
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:48,920
Isn't it?

2252
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:49,620
Yeah.

2253
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,380
First and second floor are Dashinban.

2254
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:55,120
The first floor is more like regular anime goods.

2255
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:56,980
And then the second floor is like doujin.

2256
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:00,400
And a little bit more yabai stuff.

2257
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:00,620
And a little bit more yabai stuff.

2258
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:00,660
Hahaha.

2259
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:04,200
Chuuu.

2260
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:04,860
Thank you.

2261
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,980
Still not as much as an overpriced scam as Mashakusou.

2262
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:10,900
Maybe.

2263
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:11,780
Who knows.

2264
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,580
But um yeah you can get figures.

2265
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,080
Like you know.

2266
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:17,660
I say anime goods.

2267
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,220
There's like Vtuber stuff down here too.

2268
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,220
But the more yabai stuff is on the second floor.

2269
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:23,780
If you're looking for that.

2270
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,500
Um the third floor is like a mishmash of a ton of different stores.

2271
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:29,460
Um.

2272
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:33,500
You have like the Trio is an idol store.

2273
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,720
Which I like to go frequent.

2274
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:35,640
Um.

2275
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,460
You have card shops.

2276
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,520
You have figure shops.

2277
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:40,780
You have a lot of different kind of stuff.

2278
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:43,240
Same on the fourth floor.

2279
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:44,640
Um.

2280
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,180
The fifth floor is an at home cafe.

2281
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,820
One of them in Akihabara.

2282
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,420
There's actually.

2283
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,260
There's this one.

2284
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,520
There's a building of at homes.

2285
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,220
Right over here.

2286
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:58,560
And then there's one at Don Quixote.

2287
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:00,000
I.

2288
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:00,740
Honestly.

2289
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,740
This one is the biggest.

2290
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:04,600
And the nicest.

2291
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,180
I believe because it's the newest.

2292
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:08,940
But um.

2293
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:09,920
What's at home cafe?

2294
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:10,800
It's a maid cafe.

2295
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,580
It's a maid cafe.

2296
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:13,160
It's a maid cafe.

2297
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,060
I've been to this at home.

2298
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,040
How long.

2299
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:17,940
How long of a wait.

2300
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,500
Did you wait for?

2301
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:20,680
Because.

2302
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,320
What's itube studio?

2303
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,540
I'll get to that one second.

2304
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:25,440
Um.

2305
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,020
Because this at home cafe.

2306
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:29,460
I've tried going so many times.

2307
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:29,900
Oh my gosh.

2308
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:34,420
Thank you so much.

2309
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,380
Thank you.

2310
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,160
Thank you so much.

2311
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:39,880
I've been.

2312
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:42,240
I've tried to go to this at home cafe.

2313
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,500
Several times now.

2314
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:44,880
Several times.

2315
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:46,140
But.

2316
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,740
The wait has always been like two hours.

2317
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,460
It is ridiculous.

2318
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:53,060
I went to the one over here.

2319
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,100
I went to the one over here.

2320
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,780
Which is also seven floors.

2321
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:57,640
Which is also seven floors.

2322
01:29:57,820 --> 01:29:58,460
And.

2323
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:03,040
The wait there was about an hour and a half.

2324
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:03,580
The wait there was about an hour and a half.

2325
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:05,100
The wait there was about an hour and a half.

2326
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:07,340
Actually no.

2327
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,580
It was more like an hour.

2328
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:10,340
Yeah.

2329
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:13,660
But it was still very very very long time.

2330
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,680
Um.

2331
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,240
Which we probably should have done a reservation.

2332
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:18,760
But.

2333
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,620
We just didn't.

2334
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:23,200
Um.

2335
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:26,280
Yeah.

2336
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:28,380
How long is the wait for cure made?

2337
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:29,900
Like zero minutes.

2338
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,200
You can usually just.

2339
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,260
I've never had a wait.

2340
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,680
I've always just been able to walk up.

2341
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,500
Frog welcome to membership.

2342
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,040
Thank you.

2343
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:40,580
But yeah.

2344
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:41,300
So.

2345
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:42,940
You know.

2346
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:44,060
At home cafe.

2347
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:48,200
I would recommend probably going to the Don Quixote one.

2348
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,860
Because that one seems to always have the smallest line.

2349
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:51,820
For.

2350
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,300
If you're wanting to wait.

2351
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,320
Um.

2352
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:57,300
But it's also I'm pretty sure also pretty small.

2353
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,300
I've been there like just a handful of times.

2354
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:00,440
Um.

2355
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:03,640
And I'll show you Don Quixote later.

2356
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:04,880
Uh.

2357
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,840
The one in Akiba.

2358
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:08,340
Um.

2359
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,480
Since it's so packed.

2360
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:11,260
Is it expensive?

2361
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,500
It's really just high quality.

2362
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,940
Like um.

2363
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,460
The kind of experience that you get.

2364
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,600
Is really high quality.

2365
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,260
So.

2366
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:22,420
Um.

2367
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,700
You know it's really popular with guys and girls.

2368
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,600
With like all sorts of people.

2369
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,380
And then of course.

2370
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,560
Because it's like one of the more popular made cafes.

2371
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,920
It's also very popular with foreigners.

2372
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:34,500
So.

2373
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,980
You just get like a ton of people going there all the time.

2374
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,160
So.

2375
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:41,200
Um.

2376
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,480
If you go to at home cafe.

2377
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:43,540
Prepare to wait.

2378
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,680
Unless you do a reservation.

2379
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:45,960
Um.

2380
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:51,160
But is high quality good for made cafes?

2381
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,760
I think it depends on.

2382
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,120
What kind of.

2383
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,580
Experience you want.

2384
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,280
At the top here.

2385
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:02,180
Is this place called iTunes Studio.

2386
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:03,100
Um.

2387
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:05,180
It used to be an idol cafe.

2388
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,860
That I actually auditioned for.

2389
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,320
Called Backstage Pass.

2390
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,060
Which I made it into.

2391
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,380
But then I turned it down.

2392
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,400
Because I wanted to focus more on my studies.

2393
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,260
Um.

2394
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:16,740
Um.

2395
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,120
But now as you can see here.

2396
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,580
The sign was over here.

2397
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:23,900
Meow.

2398
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:25,800
Meow.

2399
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,280
Right here.

2400
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,960
This was Backstage Pass.

2401
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,220
This is Horiyuchi Kaori.

2402
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,480
Um.

2403
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:34,880
Oh gosh.

2404
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:35,520
What was her name?

2405
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,600
They don't have my Oshii.

2406
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,220
Oh there's um.

2407
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,900
There's Moyazu.

2408
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,100
She's a really popular um.

2409
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:44,200
She's a really popular.

2410
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,640
Mukbang YouTuber.

2411
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,100
She eats so much food.

2412
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,240
She eats so much food.

2413
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:53,520
Um.

2414
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:54,860
Oh my gosh.

2415
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,460
What was your name?

2416
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:58,340
Was it Yui?

2417
01:32:58,580 --> 01:32:59,480
I don't remember.

2418
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:01,880
But yeah.

2419
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,640
They don't have my Oshii up here.

2420
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:04,180
But that's okay.

2421
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:05,240
I think she had already graduated.

2422
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,700
So it was this um.

2423
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:07,600
At the cafe.

2424
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,580
It was actually produced by the same person.

2425
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,860
That produced uh.

2426
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:13,560
Does she eat shiroko?

2427
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:14,560
She has.

2428
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:15,340
She has.

2429
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:15,940
She has.

2430
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:17,260
Oh my gosh.

2431
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,140
Yeah.

2432
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:18,720
She has.

2433
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:19,940
She did a video recently.

2434
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,780
You mean shirako?

2435
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:24,500
No.

2436
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:24,860
Wait.

2437
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,040
Shiroko.

2438
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,500
Shiroko from.

2439
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:32,680
Shiroko from.

2440
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:36,400
Shiroko.

2441
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:36,860
Shiroko.

2442
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:36,860
No.

2443
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,800
Don't eat shiroko from Blue Archive.

2444
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,240
Shiroko.

2445
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:44,300
Shiroko.

2446
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:47,480
What was I saying?

2447
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:50,000
What was I saying?

2448
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:50,960
What was I saying?

2449
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:54,300
Oh.

2450
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,160
Um.

2451
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:56,780
It was produced by the same person.

2452
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,000
That produced uh.

2453
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:59,400
It was Morning Musume.

2454
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:01,860
Tsunku and Hello Project.

2455
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:02,960
So um.

2456
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,500
Their songs were very.

2457
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,380
Pretty uh.

2458
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:09,280
What's the word?

2459
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:11,820
Like Hello Project like.

2460
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,040
And um.

2461
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:18,140
Unfortunately it's closed now.

2462
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:19,340
Which is so sad.

2463
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:22,520
Because I would visit very often.

2464
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,720
And it turned into this.

2465
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,160
iTube Studio.

2466
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,460
Which was like.

2467
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:29,880
Amalgamation of backstage.

2468
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,920
And iTube Studio.

2469
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:34,160
Which was just a cafe.

2470
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,220
Of YouTubers.

2471
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:36,600
I never went.

2472
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:38,900
Because I was so confused by it.

2473
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,740
I did not understand.

2474
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,600
It was just a cafe.

2475
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:44,500
Where you can go and talk to YouTubers.

2476
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,500
Or girls that were wanting to be.

2477
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:47,820
Popular YouTubers.

2478
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,060
It was very weird.

2479
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:51,960
And the inside of the cafe.

2480
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,080
Used to be so iconic for backstage.

2481
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,800
And then they like tore it all apart.

2482
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,220
For this ugly like.

2483
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,860
It looked like a Mac store.

2484
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:02,280
But iTube Studio.

2485
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:04,100
Has also since shut down.

2486
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:04,880
So.

2487
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:08,760
So we don't even have.

2488
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:09,480
I don't know.

2489
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:11,100
I don't know.

2490
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:12,480
What will pop up there next.

2491
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:14,160
I'll be on the lookout.

2492
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:14,840
I suppose.

2493
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,140
You were telling us.

2494
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:21,060
About how you're cute enough.

2495
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:22,560
To get accepted into an idol group.

2496
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:23,080
No.

2497
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:23,840
Oh my gosh.

2498
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:25,140
My audition for it was so.

2499
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,120
It was so embarrassing.

2500
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:32,020
I.

2501
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:33,040
I.

2502
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,280
They actually had it.

2503
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,900
Not at the cafe itself.

2504
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,720
It was like at some.

2505
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:39,400
Separate building.

2506
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:41,800
Which.

2507
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:43,920
I might be able to find.

2508
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,140
Probably not though.

2509
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,440
It was a long time ago.

2510
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,360
But I went.

2511
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:51,440
And.

2512
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:53,800
The guy.

2513
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:56,420
Was like interviewing some of us.

2514
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,260
He was just like wow.

2515
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:58,620
A foreigner.

2516
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,240
And I was just like yeah haha.

2517
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:02,960
And he was like asking me how I got into backstage.

2518
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:03,900
And stuff like that.

2519
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,100
I had seen them at an idol show.

2520
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,520
And really started to like them.

2521
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,140
But.

2522
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:13,120
I also did like some dance covers.

2523
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,860
Of some backstage songs.

2524
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:16,900
So they were like whoa.

2525
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:19,440
Whoa.

2526
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:20,800
She really likes.

2527
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:21,460
She's already.

2528
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,880
She already knows the choreography.

2529
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,100
So I showed him that.

2530
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:27,420
And.

2531
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,520
Then they took us.

2532
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,740
He was like showing the other people though.

2533
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,220
My videos and I was really embarrassed.

2534
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:35,940
But.

2535
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,460
Then we go to the.

2536
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:38,900
To the.

2537
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,820
To the actual like.

2538
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,100
Audition part.

2539
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,200
Which was three people sitting in a.

2540
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:47,260
Dance studio.

2541
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,960
Like you know there was the mirrored walls and everything.

2542
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:51,400
And we sat along the wall.

2543
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,380
And they called us up one by one.

2544
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:56,180
And they asked us to sing something.

2545
01:36:57,740 --> 01:36:58,700
And I was like.

2546
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,320
I was like okay.

2547
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:03,040
And I was like I've never done an audition before.

2548
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:04,660
Especially in Japan.

2549
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:06,780
I've never done any sort of audition like this.

2550
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:07,960
I've never done.

2551
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:09,900
An audition in Japan.

2552
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:11,480
I've never auditioned for an idol group.

2553
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:13,200
So I was like super duper nervous.

2554
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:15,480
Acapella yes acapella.

2555
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:17,440
And um.

2556
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:19,160
So I was just like okay.

2557
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:22,540
So I was just like okay.

2558
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:23,580
Unfortunately.

2559
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:26,720
I could not follow what the other girls did.

2560
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,640
Because they called me first.

2561
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:29,680
And I was like.

2562
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,240
Okay.

2563
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:34,820
And so.

2564
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,780
I stand up and I'm standing in the middle of the room.

2565
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:39,040
And they ask me some questions.

2566
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:39,840
And they were just like.

2567
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,900
They asked me about like dancing.

2568
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:44,640
And singing.

2569
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,440
And just you know why I wanted to join backstage.

2570
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,260
And I was like this and this and this.

2571
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:50,040
And that and that and that.

2572
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,460
And then they were like okay.

2573
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:54,220
Now sing something for us.

2574
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,620
And I was like.

2575
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:57,880
Um.

2576
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,240
Anything?

2577
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:02,760
Sorry I'm cringing right now.

2578
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,480
I'm cringing right now so bad.

2579
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,420
I don't know how I got in.

2580
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:10,780
Because they were like.

2581
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:11,220
Yeah anything.

2582
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,200
And I was like okay.

2583
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:24,620
Okay.

2584
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:29,740
I don't even.

2585
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,460
I just go.

2586
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,080
And they were like thank you.

2587
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,200
You can sit down now.

2588
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:40,480
And then.

2589
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:43,000
I'm like sitting there.

2590
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:43,600
Like okay.

2591
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:45,080
That's not right.

2592
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,660
And then the next girl goes up.

2593
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,380
And they ask her like similar questions.

2594
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:50,500
And then they're like okay sing something for us.

2595
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,380
And she has a whole dance.

2596
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:53,840
And song prepared.

2597
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:56,200
And she's just like singing the song.

2598
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:56,680
The actual.

2599
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,660
She's actually singing.

2600
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:04,960
She's actually singing a song with words.

2601
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:05,600
And.

2602
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:07,600
And a melody.

2603
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:08,640
And.

2604
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:13,240
And like doing a dance to go along with it.

2605
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:19,920
And I was like.

2606
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:21,580
In that moment.

2607
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,860
I felt everything drain from my face.

2608
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:24,900
And I was like.

2609
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,900
I was like oh.

2610
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:29,680
That's what they meant.

2611
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:30,640
I don't know why.

2612
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,280
At the moment.

2613
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:35,380
I thought that they just wanted to hear a little bit of my.

2614
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:39,740
You actually sang Hamtaro didn't you?

2615
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,320
That would have been probably better.

2616
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,560
Than what I did.

2617
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:46,860
I just sat there.

2618
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,180
I was like I messed up.

2619
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:49,360
I messed up.

2620
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:50,840
I messed up.

2621
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:53,140
And then when I got the email that was like.

2622
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:54,640
We got you in.

2623
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:55,860
I was like what?

2624
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:56,940
How?

2625
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:00,560
How did I pass?

2626
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,400
Part of me.

2627
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:06,000
Part of me.

2628
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:08,300
A little bit regrets not joining.

2629
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,560
Because it probably would have been.

2630
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:10,920
A good experience.

2631
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,600
To join.

2632
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,560
But like I said.

2633
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:16,900
I wanted to focus on my studies.

2634
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:19,280
And another part was I was so nervous.

2635
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,500
I had no confidence in my Japanese.

2636
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:23,040
Like that.

2637
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,840
I thought oh my gosh.

2638
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,140
I'm going to get yelled at every day at work.

2639
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,580
Because they are going to say.

2640
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:31,660
They are going to be like.

2641
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:32,780
Why didn't you understand?

2642
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:33,680
And I would be like.

2643
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:39,460
But it's okay.

2644
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:44,480
It was still good.

2645
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,600
It was still an interesting experience.

2646
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:46,700
Being able to.

2647
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:47,700
Being evil.

2648
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:52,240
Being able to even.

2649
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:53,820
Attempt an audition.

2650
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,600
For an idol group.

2651
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:56,940
Well it wasn't an idol group.

2652
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:57,560
An idol cafe.

2653
01:40:58,260 --> 01:40:59,320
Being evil.

2654
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:07,380
Anyway.

2655
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,120
This is an Akiba tour everybody.

2656
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,000
So sorry about that little tangent.

2657
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:13,740
We have a figure shop here.

2658
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:15,780
There is so many.

2659
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:17,780
If I point out every figure shop.

2660
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:18,980
In Akiba.

2661
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:20,140
We will be here forever.

2662
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,600
Let's go down here a little bit.

2663
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:24,640
This is the.

2664
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,900
You can't see it.

2665
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,740
This is the other at home cafe.

2666
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:31,600
It's all.

2667
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:32,540
It's all these floors.

2668
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:34,800
All of these floors are at home cafe.

2669
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:36,640
So it's kind of cool.

2670
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,460
There is a gamer lounge.

2671
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,560
Down here.

2672
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,320
You have yellow submarine.

2673
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,920
Which is just like a hobby shop.

2674
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:46,740
You have trading cards.

2675
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:50,340
You have the AmiAmi store here as well.

2676
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:54,420
Gamers only.

2677
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:55,560
They have.

2678
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:56,040
They sell.

2679
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,040
It's like a.

2680
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:00,040
What's the word?

2681
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:00,860
They have like monitors.

2682
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:02,500
Gaming monitors and stuff like that.

2683
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,160
Checking my feed at how cute she is.

2684
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:06,080
You cannot stop me.

2685
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:07,040
What do you mean?

2686
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:10,780
Why?

2687
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,800
What do you mean by that?

2688
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:29,220
I'll be honest.

2689
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:31,680
I've never had a reason to go into this building.

2690
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,300
There's like a.

2691
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:36,020
One of those other tourist spots here.

2692
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,180
Like those tourist stores.

2693
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:39,580
They sell a bunch of luggage.

2694
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:40,280
That's all I know.

2695
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,040
But I've never had a reason to go into this building.

2696
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:45,580
So I don't actually really know what's all in it.

2697
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:45,940
Isn't it?

2698
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:48,840
Looks like just trading cards.

2699
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:49,140
So.

2700
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,000
Yeah.

2701
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:52,480
Let's see.

2702
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:53,240
So here.

2703
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,200
Just to get you guys caught up to speed.

2704
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:56,160
This is Chuo-dori.

2705
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,220
This is the main road.

2706
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:00,460
If we go back here a little bit.

2707
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:03,500
There's.

2708
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,600
Actually this is the other Gigo.

2709
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,000
There's another Gigo down there.

2710
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:10,060
This one is the Gigo that does.

2711
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,400
That has the cafe in it.

2712
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:12,800
Wait.

2713
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:13,980
Is it this one?

2714
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:14,760
Is it Sango?

2715
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:14,800
Sango?

2716
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,060
Or is it the one down there?

2717
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:19,240
I think it's this one.

2718
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,320
I'm pretty sure it's this one.

2719
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,980
Is the one that has the cafe in it.

2720
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:25,000
As well.

2721
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:26,360
Yeah.

2722
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:26,920
Collab Cafe.

2723
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:27,880
Yeah.

2724
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:28,140
Yeah.

2725
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:28,400
Yeah.

2726
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:31,060
So.

2727
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:32,940
Usually though these require a reservation.

2728
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:34,980
At least they used to in the past.

2729
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,780
I haven't been to one in a long time.

2730
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:38,720
But it's an arcade.

2731
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:39,440
And also.

2732
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,720
Last time I was here.

2733
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:42,800
There was a Vispo.

2734
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,160
A little collab cafe and stuff.

2735
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:47,580
Mulan.

2736
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:49,500
Mulan is just another.

2737
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,860
I'd say touristy store.

2738
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,140
But it's really just like.

2739
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:56,500
Used figures and things like that.

2740
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:58,940
You have a Yoshinoya.

2741
01:43:59,080 --> 01:43:59,480
Which is.

2742
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:02,500
Gyudon.

2743
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:04,000
You have a Gogo Kare.

2744
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,120
There's nothing really.

2745
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:11,340
Over here.

2746
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,240
I'm gonna go back down.

2747
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:15,340
This way though.

2748
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:18,640
So here's the Kotobukiya.

2749
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:28,140
Oh yeah.

2750
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:29,380
Esports Lounge.

2751
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:30,300
It says it right there.

2752
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:32,180
There you go.

2753
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:33,880
Esports Lounge.

2754
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:34,880
I wish it was open though.

2755
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,040
I wish you could see inside.

2756
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:37,540
Oh wait.

2757
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:38,100
Maybe from here.

2758
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:39,240
Just kidding.

2759
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:41,140
Here.

2760
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,880
If I'm going too fast.

2761
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:45,320
Just let me know.

2762
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:46,760
If you're like.

2763
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:47,980
Mint I can't see.

2764
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:49,740
Why?

2765
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,320
Always someone.

2766
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:53,440
It looks cool though.

2767
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,320
It looks cool in there.

2768
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:01,020
I've always wanted to go to this place.

2769
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,360
Because it's like a ghost.

2770
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:03,900
A ghost themed.

2771
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,860
Like a Chinese ghost themed.

2772
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:07,880
Cafe.

2773
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:10,140
Maybe I'll go next time.

2774
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:11,320
Sometimes I'm worried because.

2775
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,900
Sometimes they're less cafe and more bar like.

2776
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:15,600
And those two places.

2777
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:15,940
One.

2778
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:17,060
Tend to be more expensive.

2779
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,280
And two.

2780
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,660
I don't really drink.

2781
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,000
So I'm just kind of like.

2782
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:24,940
What will I get?

2783
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:27,440
What will I get?

2784
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:33,120
Jiangshi.

2785
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:35,240
Yeah you have like these billboards.

2786
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:37,220
That are all like different types of cafes.

2787
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:40,220
So you have this one.

2788
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:41,740
Which this one I've always.

2789
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:43,700
I'm going to go to this one next time.

2790
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:44,820
Because hold on.

2791
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:46,760
Sorry I'm skipping ahead a little bit.

2792
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,440
Wait hold on.

2793
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,640
Can you see it from here?

2794
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,200
Yeah it's all like all this foresty.

2795
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,020
Everything up here.

2796
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:57,300
It's all these.

2797
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,160
It's like this foresty.

2798
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:00,200
Like it looks.

2799
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:01,820
So cool in there.

2800
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:03,880
Witch's garden.

2801
01:46:04,780 --> 01:46:06,020
But you can see here.

2802
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:07,420
It's 800 yen.

2803
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:09,800
Sorry for the giant arrow.

2804
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:13,240
It's 800 yen for 30 minutes.

2805
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:14,640
Oh wait.

2806
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:16,080
Oh wait that's soft drink.

2807
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,020
That's soft drink all you can drink.

2808
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:20,240
All you can drink soft drink.

2809
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:21,020
I can't see the.

2810
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:22,580
There's a course here.

2811
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:23,980
I thought that was the table charge.

2812
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:25,280
Oh maybe not.

2813
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:31,200
But 800 yen for 30 minutes.

2814
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,500
How much are you drinking?

2815
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:35,120
How much even soft drinks.

2816
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:36,320
I don't think I can get through.

2817
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:39,460
Even like 3 soft drinks in 30 minutes.

2818
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:39,940
You know.

2819
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,480
That's like.

2820
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,360
Sucking it down.

2821
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:48,440
I know right.

2822
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:50,880
I don't think I can get through so much.

2823
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:53,620
Soft drinks wouldn't be worth it.

2824
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:57,000
But for the alcohol it's 1500 yen for 30 minutes.

2825
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:00,220
I wonder what the table charge is here.

2826
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,080
Hmm.

2827
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:03,680
There's another maid cafe.

2828
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,560
This is kind of a maid cafe building.

2829
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,300
I'm so sad because this Lawson used to be.

2830
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,180
Um.

2831
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:13,000
It used to be.

2832
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,420
A dragon quest themed Lawson.

2833
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,920
And when you go inside.

2834
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:17,580
It would go.

2835
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,380
And when you left it would go.

2836
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:23,020
Or it would play another sound.

2837
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:24,580
And they played like the dragon quest.

2838
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,960
Theme inside and everything.

2839
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,580
But I found.

2840
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:28,760
I don't know if it's permanent.

2841
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:31,280
But I found another dragon quest themed Lawson.

2842
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,400
In Shibuya.

2843
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:34,460
Just my last trip.

2844
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:34,940
And I was like.

2845
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:35,720
Oh my gosh.

2846
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:36,580
Did it move here?

2847
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,160
I had never seen it before.

2848
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:40,120
I don't know if it was there before.

2849
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:42,700
They still have one in Shibuya.

2850
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,300
Yeah right.

2851
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,360
Was it there before?

2852
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:47,060
Anyway okay.

2853
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:48,540
I got a little ahead of myself.

2854
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:49,300
Let's head back.

2855
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,320
Giving a tour is hard.

2856
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:56,860
Because there's so much.

2857
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:58,000
There's so many roads.

2858
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:00,740
So this is where.

2859
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,060
The chubby girl cafe used to be.

2860
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:04,720
It was this building.

2861
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:07,000
I believe.

2862
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:09,140
This is where the chubby girl cafe used to be.

2863
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:09,340
Ah!

2864
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,100
You can see it!

2865
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:11,320
Shangri-La.

2866
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:11,940
Yes.

2867
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:14,980
But it is not here anymore.

2868
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:18,000
So if you put in Shangri-La.

2869
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,860
Into Google Maps.

2870
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:21,040
It might take you here.

2871
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:22,700
It is not here anymore.

2872
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,500
So do not come over here.

2873
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:28,080
I will show you where the new location is.

2874
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,400
I'll show you where the new location is.

2875
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:31,800
It still exists.

2876
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:33,060
It still exists.

2877
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:33,780
Stop saying no!

2878
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,200
It still exists.

2879
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,620
It's just not in this location.

2880
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:38,560
It moved.

2881
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:42,500
It moved.

2882
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:42,840
It moved.

2883
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,100
But yeah.

2884
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:46,660
Let's see.

2885
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:47,700
Down here.

2886
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:48,700
Made cafes.

2887
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:49,740
As you can see.

2888
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:52,900
There's a whole building of them.

2889
01:48:54,140 --> 01:48:55,700
Made cafes everywhere.

2890
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:57,580
Akihabara is so perfect!

2891
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,120
There's a Coco's restaurant down here.

2892
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,080
Which is just a.

2893
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:04,400
Just a family restaurant.

2894
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:05,720
But they have.

2895
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:08,440
They have quesadillas.

2896
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:11,760
And here.

2897
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,020
If you see the hello storage.

2898
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,140
That means you've reached.

2899
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:16,560
Akiba Zettai Ryouiki!

2900
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,840
Which is one of my favorite.

2901
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:19,420
Made cafes.

2902
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:21,320
It's super duper cute.

2903
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:23,720
The girls are very cute.

2904
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:25,640
The performances are always so good.

2905
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:27,900
So I recommend.

2906
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:30,240
Zettai Ryouiki.

2907
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:31,400
Very much.

2908
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:35,960
I love their uniforms.

2909
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:36,620
Me too!

2910
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:40,840
There's also more stuff down this street.

2911
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:42,020
But we'll go down here later.

2912
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:45,600
We'll go down here later.

2913
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:50,180
We'll go down here later.

2914
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:50,960
So many maids.

2915
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:51,160
I know.

2916
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,460
Actually here.

2917
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:55,780
This place.

2918
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,200
Is a Warhammer store.

2919
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:00,120
Which I was.

2920
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:01,420
So shocked to see.

2921
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:02,440
When I saw it.

2922
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:02,820
I was like.

2923
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:04,220
I messaged Matara immediately.

2924
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:05,780
Matara!

2925
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:07,720
There's a Warhammer store in Akiba!

2926
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:08,340
She was like.

2927
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:09,260
Yeah I know.

2928
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:09,960
I was like.

2929
01:50:12,020 --> 01:50:12,660
You knew?

2930
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:15,780
You knew something about Akiba that I didn't?

2931
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,380
But it's right next to Akiba Culture Zone.

2932
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:22,760
So...

2933
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:28,520
Matara knows more about Akiba.

2934
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:29,660
Than me!

2935
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:33,480
Yeah but...

2936
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:38,190
Yeah.

2937
01:50:39,670 --> 01:50:40,610
I've never been in.

2938
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:42,690
Because I don't know anything about Warhammer.

2939
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:44,450
It also says it's a cafe.

2940
01:50:44,630 --> 01:50:46,670
I'm more curious about the cafe.

2941
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:47,870
Than anything.

2942
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:49,910
Let's see.

2943
01:50:49,970 --> 01:50:50,790
Which way do we...

2944
01:50:50,790 --> 01:50:52,570
Let's go down the main street.

2945
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:53,310
A little bit.

2946
01:50:53,470 --> 01:50:55,330
And then I'll show you more of the backstreet stuff.

2947
01:50:56,230 --> 01:50:57,230
Backstreet stuff.

2948
01:50:57,730 --> 01:50:58,290
Alright!

2949
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:00,470
Look at all these people.

2950
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:03,310
This building here.

2951
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:05,630
Sometimes they do events.

2952
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:07,410
Down here.

2953
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:08,570
Like...

2954
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:11,070
Like game festivals.

2955
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:12,930
Or really anything.

2956
01:51:13,210 --> 01:51:14,350
I've seen concerts there.

2957
01:51:14,490 --> 01:51:16,770
I've seen figures there.

2958
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:18,290
I've seen like Tamashii Nation stuff.

2959
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:19,970
Stuff stuff there.

2960
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:22,510
Um...

2961
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:24,270
Yeah.

2962
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:25,550
Lots of stuff there.

2963
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:26,990
That you can see sometimes.

2964
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:29,130
There's a big camera here.

2965
01:51:29,370 --> 01:51:29,930
Oh yeah!

2966
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:34,810
There's also McDonald's.

2967
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:38,950
I showed you the other McDonald's by Yodobashi Camera.

2968
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:40,450
It was the one...

2969
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:41,450
It's over there.

2970
01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,030
This one's also...

2971
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:47,230
McDonald's.

2972
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:53,910
Hello!

2973
01:51:54,010 --> 01:51:54,430
Hello.

2974
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:01,130
Um...

2975
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:03,910
This is the...

2976
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:05,730
When you're lost, by the way.

2977
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:07,270
The train station is right here.

2978
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:10,670
This is the UDX building that I showed before.

2979
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:11,490
It has some...

2980
01:52:11,490 --> 01:52:12,550
Some...

2981
01:52:13,330 --> 01:52:16,330
Sometimes they do like events and promo things here as well.

2982
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:17,530
Like uh...

2983
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:18,490
I saw a big...

2984
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:21,770
Big pop-up for the new Idol Master.

2985
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:23,030
The school...

2986
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:24,370
The school Idol Master.

2987
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:25,910
But um...

2988
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:27,630
Down here, there's Tamashii Nation.

2989
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:29,370
There's the train station.

2990
01:52:29,370 --> 01:52:32,410
We honestly haven't gotten that far at all.

2991
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:32,850
We honestly haven't gotten that far at all.

2992
01:52:34,530 --> 01:52:36,570
There's so much to see in Akihabara.

2993
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:36,630
There's so much to see in Akihabara.

2994
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:39,450
We barely walked like two feet away from the...

2995
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:39,710
We barely walked like two feet away from the...

2996
01:52:40,410 --> 01:52:41,450
From the...

2997
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:42,210
From the station.

2998
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:50,670
Yeah.

2999
01:52:55,530 --> 01:52:56,890
Let's go back to the main road.

3000
01:52:56,890 --> 01:52:57,190
Pew!

3001
01:52:57,730 --> 01:52:58,210
Pew!

3002
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:02,970
You'll see a lot of people like taking pictures of like this...

3003
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:03,830
Section.

3004
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:05,210
Of...

3005
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:06,510
Of Akihabara.

3006
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:09,290
It's kind of like iconic for the at-home poster.

3007
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:10,790
And then this...

3008
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:12,830
Whatever place...

3009
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:14,030
The pawn shop.

3010
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:17,290
That I'm always like...

3011
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:19,670
It always feels so out of place every time I see it.

3012
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:21,570
Um...

3013
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:24,890
And then there's always like a bunch of anime and game signs.

3014
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:25,790
It's very...

3015
01:53:26,890 --> 01:53:28,330
This scene is so Akihabara.

3016
01:53:28,490 --> 01:53:29,070
You know?

3017
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:30,790
Yeah!

3018
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:34,090
It always reminds me of Dragon Ball 2.

3019
01:53:34,570 --> 01:53:35,810
Every time I see it.

3020
01:53:37,410 --> 01:53:38,070
So yeah.

3021
01:53:38,110 --> 01:53:39,090
Big camera here.

3022
01:53:39,670 --> 01:53:41,110
Which has lots of great stuff.

3023
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,710
Big camera is not just Akihabara.

3024
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:44,530
You can go anywhere.

3025
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:46,570
Um...

3026
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:55,000
So this is where the new Volks building is.

3027
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:55,800
Um...

3028
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:56,840
The one that I showed earlier.

3029
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:59,120
That turned into a sad, sad drug store.

3030
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:00,380
It is now here.

3031
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,000
This is where Toranoano was.

3032
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:04,940
So it's kind of sad.

3033
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:07,040
But at least it turned into Volks.

3034
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:08,380
Um...

3035
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,460
So you have your Dolphy stuff.

3036
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:11,620
You have a...

3037
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:13,900
You have a bunch of hobby stuff in there.

3038
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:15,060
Um...

3039
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:16,800
Like figures...

3040
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:20,080
Just general merch and everything.

3041
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:22,140
Um...

3042
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:23,640
You have a Taito here.

3043
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:24,520
Which...

3044
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,200
Do they show it in this picture?

3045
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:27,940
Oh...

3046
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:29,340
Oh my gosh.

3047
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:30,380
It's Taito...

3048
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:30,980
Wait.

3049
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:31,500
September.

3050
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:34,060
It's Taito pre...

3051
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:35,000
Okay.

3052
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:37,440
B...

3053
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:40,460
It's Taito...

3054
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:42,720
What do you even call those?

3055
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:44,120
It's Taito's BC.

3056
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:46,660
Before the Clappening.

3057
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:48,140
So there's these...

3058
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:49,820
Oh I don't want to say it.

3059
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:52,480
They're so annoying.

3060
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,720
There's these stupid...

3061
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:58,540
These stupid fucking things that they put out.

3062
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:00,060
There's like three of them.

3063
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:00,980
Oh my god.

3064
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:02,300
They're so annoying.

3065
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:05,160
They look like birds.

3066
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:07,160
The little clappers.

3067
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,640
I hate them.

3068
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:10,180
They're so annoying.

3069
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:12,040
They're so...

3070
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,800
They sit there and they go...

3071
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,420
All day long.

3072
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:19,140
And there's...

3073
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:20,020
Why are there three?

3074
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:23,660
But there's three of them.

3075
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:25,740
And they just sit there and they're just like...

3076
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:29,780
And it's so...

3077
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:30,520
So annoying.

3078
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:32,200
I hate...

3079
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,420
I hate walking past it every time.

3080
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:36,040
I'm like Taito what are you...

3081
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:37,140
Why did you put those out?

3082
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:39,160
They're so annoying.

3083
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:43,800
I think they talk.

3084
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:45,520
I just don't know what they're saying.

3085
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:46,520
Because I try to...

3086
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,860
I try to just...

3087
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:50,380
Tune them out.

3088
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:51,240
They're so...

3089
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:53,920
They're like...

3090
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:55,720
They're like... I don't even know.

3091
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:56,160
Hold on.

3092
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:57,320
Let me see if I can find a picture.

3093
01:55:59,000 --> 01:55:59,360
Taito...

3094
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,760
Arcade... Taito Station...

3095
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:02,620
Akihabara.

3096
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:06,080
I don't even know what to call them though.

3097
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:07,820
Like I have to find a really recent picture.

3098
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:09,360
Because...

3099
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:12,080
They are recent.

3100
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:13,500
They...

3101
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,640
And they like sit on top of the arcade machines.

3102
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,460
They... Let me... Actually I can draw a picture of them.

3103
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:19,280
That might be easier.

3104
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,700
I'm gonna draw a picture real quick.

3105
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:26,380
One second.

3106
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:26,840
One second.

3107
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:29,900
Uh...

3108
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:29,920
Uh...

3109
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:32,940
Woah what the hell?

3110
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:34,660
There we go.

3111
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:40,680
So they look like...

3112
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:41,960
So they look like...

3113
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:42,380
Uh...

3114
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:44,480
They look... They are...

3115
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:45,680
Oh no.

3116
01:56:45,740 --> 01:56:46,260
Oops my bad.

3117
01:56:46,740 --> 01:56:47,380
This one.

3118
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,280
They have like...

3119
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:52,240
They have like...

3120
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:53,500
This bulbous head.

3121
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:55,340
And this tiny tube body.

3122
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:57,500
And they like...

3123
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:58,840
Have their little feet down here.

3124
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,360
They look like they could be from Petscop.

3125
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:02,400
And then they have eyes.

3126
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:05,800
Like beady... Little stupid beady eyes.

3127
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:07,560
And then they have this...

3128
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,280
Dumbass duck beak looking shit.

3129
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:12,840
And then they have arms that do this.

3130
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:14,200
And then they have arms that do this.

3131
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:15,160
They go over their head.

3132
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:17,360
And they have giant...

3133
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:18,360
Clapping hands.

3134
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:20,060
And they're...

3135
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:22,260
They're bright red.

3136
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:25,600
Like that.

3137
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:30,080
And all they do...

3138
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:30,760
They talk.

3139
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:31,840
They open their mouths.

3140
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,700
And they go like...

3141
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,940
And then just...

3142
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:38,880
And they clap their hands.

3143
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:40,620
But there's three of them.

3144
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:42,440
And they don't shut up.

3145
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,180
Thank you.

3146
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:45,500
Thank you.

3147
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:45,700
Thank you.

3148
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:49,540
Hey, what's wrong with duck beaks?

3149
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:49,800
Oh.

3150
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:51,800
Sorry, ducky.

3151
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:57,760
They even look annoying.

3152
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:58,100
I know.

3153
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,440
I want to punch them every time.

3154
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:01,160
And they're super loud.

3155
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:01,660
They are.

3156
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:02,920
They're so loud.

3157
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:05,380
I just...

3158
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:06,220
I'm so...

3159
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:09,340
I know one day they'll probably...

3160
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:10,160
Grow on me.

3161
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:11,320
One day...

3162
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:13,580
One day I'll like go back to Akiba.

3163
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:14,360
And they'll be gone.

3164
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,160
And I'll be like...

3165
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,180
Where's the clappy ducks?

3166
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,680
And I'll be so sad.

3167
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:25,160
I'll be like... I'll be like walking by...

3168
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:26,480
The Taito Arcade.

3169
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:27,600
And I'll be like...

3170
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:28,480
Oh, it's so quiet.

3171
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:31,160
And I'll look to the top of the arcade machine...

3172
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:32,140
With wistful eyes.

3173
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:34,100
And I'll just imagine them up there...

3174
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:35,000
Greeting me.

3175
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:40,120
And I'll just be so sad.

3176
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,240
I'll be like...

3177
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:43,880
Little clappy man.

3178
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:44,880
Where did you go?

3179
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:50,080
My eyes will glaze over with tears.

3180
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:50,700
My eyes will glaze over with tears.

3181
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:51,060
They'll just...

3182
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:51,720
They'll be...

3183
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:54,760
I'll do like a sad nod being like...

3184
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:55,860
Yeah.

3185
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,740
Yeah, I hope you're out there clapping in heaven.

3186
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:01,880
Mima!

3187
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:05,620
So annoying.

3188
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:10,340
The fact that I could draw it...

3189
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:10,440
The fact that I could draw it...

3190
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:12,500
Probably as accurate as I could...

3191
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:12,780
Probably as accurate as I could...

3192
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:14,960
From memory...

3193
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,460
Just probably goes to...

3194
01:59:16,460 --> 01:59:17,700
Uh oh.

3195
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:20,900
Probably goes to show...

3196
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:23,160
How much of an impact they've made on my afterlife.

3197
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:24,220
Truly.

3198
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:25,920
God.

3199
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:26,620
Anyway.

3200
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:30,920
I could listen to you...

3201
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:31,960
Talk about Akiba forever.

3202
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,440
You're my favorite geography teacher.

3203
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,620
Thank you, student K-Barn.

3204
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:43,620
They're called Big Clappy.

3205
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:44,760
Wait, actually?

3206
01:59:45,980 --> 01:59:47,200
Big Clappy.

3207
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:51,180
Oh my god, you're...

3208
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:51,840
No!

3209
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:57,460
Oh my god, no way!

3210
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:01,900
Oh my god.

3211
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:07,540
I already closed out of my picture.

3212
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:10,180
No.

3213
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:11,960
No!

3214
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:12,940
No!

3215
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:13,200
No!

3216
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:14,920
I

3217
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:21,000
already closed out of my picture.

3218
02:00:21,420 --> 02:00:23,100
But please, look...

3219
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:24,260
Okay, I'm gonna get a picture.

3220
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:27,480
I'm going to show you guys a picture to show how accurate...

3221
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:29,020
My paint...

3222
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:30,100
MS Paint picture was.

3223
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,400
Okay, are you guys ready for this?

3224
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:33,720
Are you guys ready to see how accurate this was?

3225
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:42,580
There's no way!

3226
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,820
It was exactly spot on!

3227
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:52,460
Not a single detail off!

3228
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:57,150
I have to buy one now.

3229
02:00:58,330 --> 02:00:59,710
I have to buy one.

3230
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:00,930
The Big Crappy.

3231
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:17,720
Oh my gosh, I just realized I don't have my noise gate on.

3232
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:20,880
Big Crappy.

3233
02:01:22,740 --> 02:01:23,580
Meet my...

3234
02:01:26,660 --> 02:01:27,800
I can't.

3235
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:29,780
I can't!

3236
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,300
Seeing that just ruined my day.

3237
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:38,240
Seeing that just ruined my day.

3238
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:40,700
Talented, brilliant, incredible...

3239
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:41,560
Stop!

3240
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:41,580
Stop!

3241
02:01:41,580 --> 02:01:42,380
Stop Lady Gaga!

3242
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:51,860
Sorry, I accidentally...

3243
02:01:55,090 --> 02:01:58,290
I accidentally just opened a Lady Gaga video.

3244
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:58,850
I have...

3245
02:01:59,190 --> 02:02:00,230
saved it on my computer.

3246
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:08,150
Oh gosh, sorry.

3247
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:09,310
That was probably so loud.

3248
02:02:10,290 --> 02:02:11,770
My tummy hurts.

3249
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:17,350
Imagine a horror game where you're chased by these things.

3250
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:19,390
You would hear it forever.

3251
02:02:19,650 --> 02:02:20,470
Forever ago.

3252
02:02:20,770 --> 02:02:22,530
You would hear it across the world.

3253
02:02:22,650 --> 02:02:23,630
It's clapping so hard.

3254
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:27,410
It doesn't sound like heaven is their final destination.

3255
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:29,170
It doesn't sound like heaven is their final destination.

3256
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:31,510
Ugh, okay.

3257
02:02:32,610 --> 02:02:34,650
Okay, back to the tour.

3258
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:36,630
We're doing a tour again, everybody.

3259
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:39,590
Anyways, there's a Taito station there.

3260
02:02:40,670 --> 02:02:42,310
Again, it's just another...

3261
02:02:45,570 --> 02:02:46,770
Another... what's the word?

3262
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:47,470
Arcade.

3263
02:02:47,710 --> 02:02:49,630
This building, I believe, is finished.

3264
02:02:50,190 --> 02:02:50,970
Is it not?

3265
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:54,950
Am I making that up?

3266
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:55,650
Maybe...

3267
02:02:57,590 --> 02:02:58,870
Am I making that up?

3268
02:02:58,950 --> 02:02:59,170
Wait.

3269
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:00,610
Or I'm thinking of another one.

3270
02:03:00,810 --> 02:03:01,170
No.

3271
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:03,510
No, I think this building is finished now.

3272
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:05,010
Yeah, it was finished, right?

3273
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:07,390
Yeah, I remember because...

3274
02:03:07,930 --> 02:03:09,670
I went there for a...

3275
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:10,570
Tomie.

3276
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:12,930
They did a Tomie collab.

3277
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:14,330
In one of the stores.

3278
02:03:14,350 --> 02:03:15,210
It was like a pop-up stop.

3279
02:03:17,230 --> 02:03:17,670
So...

3280
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:21,510
It was...

3281
02:03:21,510 --> 02:03:23,190
I ended up not getting anything.

3282
02:03:23,190 --> 02:03:23,950
I was so sad.

3283
02:03:24,070 --> 02:03:26,270
I forgot to go back and get some stuff.

3284
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:26,970
But...

3285
02:03:29,790 --> 02:03:30,190
Yeah.

3286
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:36,290
Yes.

3287
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:37,430
It's now...

3288
02:03:39,310 --> 02:03:42,710
Well, the anime is here.

3289
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:45,110
The anime, I'm pretty sure, is still here.

3290
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:48,370
I think it's just like a bunch of random stores.

3291
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:52,110
If I remember correctly, there's a cell phone store at the bottom.

3292
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:53,870
And then it's like random stuff.

3293
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:56,450
And I think there's like a card shop in there as well.

3294
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:01,970
I don't quite remember exactly.

3295
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:04,610
All that's in there.

3296
02:04:05,670 --> 02:04:07,110
But there's the anime here.

3297
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:08,710
Ta-da!

3298
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:10,410
It's like these two buildings.

3299
02:04:12,250 --> 02:04:13,170
There are...

3300
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:19,150
If you go into this anime, this store has its own elevator and this store has its own elevator.

3301
02:04:19,390 --> 02:04:20,710
And they do not connect.

3302
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:23,710
So, make sure you go in both.

3303
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:27,330
They both have their own different staircases.

3304
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:34,890
I believe this one on the top floor has This one... I think this one...

3305
02:04:34,890 --> 02:04:37,670
Is it this one that has the cafe or this one?

3306
02:04:39,790 --> 02:04:41,010
Yeah, it's pretty inconvenient.

3307
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:42,010
Not gonna lie.

3308
02:04:43,670 --> 02:04:47,270
But this one, I think, has the event stuff at the top floor here.

3309
02:04:47,530 --> 02:04:50,130
But the top floor of this one has the Yo!

3310
02:04:50,130 --> 02:04:52,150
Star section and blue archive and stuff.

3311
02:04:52,850 --> 02:04:53,370
So...

3312
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:55,470
But one of them also has a cafe.

3313
02:04:55,730 --> 02:04:56,710
A small little cafe.

3314
02:04:59,090 --> 02:05:03,190
I say cafe, it's more like snacks and drinks and stuff.

3315
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:06,370
I was disappointed in the anime cafe.

3316
02:05:06,650 --> 02:05:08,230
Yeah, it's not really a cafe.

3317
02:05:08,510 --> 02:05:11,690
It's like I said, it's like snacks and drinks.

3318
02:05:12,290 --> 02:05:13,110
Los Timbos!

3319
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:14,290
Thank you for the five!

3320
02:05:14,350 --> 02:05:15,370
Gifted thank you!

3321
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:20,170
But yeah, so just be careful.

3322
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:22,530
I'm just like, oh, but I already went up all the floors.

3323
02:05:22,810 --> 02:05:24,650
But did you go up this one as well?

3324
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:34,230
I think this store, this one on the right also has more stuff for those interested in the BL variety.

3325
02:05:35,530 --> 02:05:40,770
And this one is of others.

3326
02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:45,310
Let's see.

3327
02:05:47,050 --> 02:05:48,370
For those wondering!

3328
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:50,150
For those wondering!

3329
02:05:50,650 --> 02:05:51,110
Bao Bao!

3330
02:05:52,010 --> 02:05:54,010
Yes, this is the miso dough!

3331
02:05:54,210 --> 02:05:58,910
This is the famous Bao Bao Mr. Doughnut!

3332
02:06:01,130 --> 02:06:04,610
So you can go here and you can sit up there and eat your doughnuts.

3333
02:06:04,950 --> 02:06:05,610
And um...

3334
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:07,050
Yeah!

3335
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:12,770
It's a great view because you get to see you know, so much of Akiba.

3336
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:14,850
I mean like the iconic stuff you can see.

3337
02:06:14,930 --> 02:06:16,130
Don Quixote you can see.

3338
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:21,230
Well, I don't want to sit there anymore because there's demons afoot.

3339
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:23,430
Or should I say, a clap.

3340
02:06:24,010 --> 02:06:25,550
But yeah, um...

3341
02:06:25,550 --> 02:06:27,290
There's a soft map here.

3342
02:06:27,850 --> 02:06:28,950
They have games.

3343
02:06:29,170 --> 02:06:31,910
They have used electronic stuff like that.

3344
02:06:32,370 --> 02:06:33,670
But yeah, miso dough!

3345
02:06:34,150 --> 02:06:35,410
Always go to miso dough.

3346
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:35,990
Get the pandering!

3347
02:06:38,350 --> 02:06:39,910
I don't remember what's here.

3348
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,720
This is not where they're building the other Appa.

3349
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:47,980
That's more down there.

3350
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:49,340
So I don't remember what's here.

3351
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:51,720
To be honest.

3352
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:55,420
I don't remember.

3353
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,200
I don't remember.

3354
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,660
Another Namtara.

3355
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:05,560
You have a pachinko parlor here.

3356
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,380
And then Don Quixote as I mentioned before.

3357
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,840
Hold on, let's go down a little bit.

3358
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:19,040
So this Don Quixote is open 24-7.

3359
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:23,880
It has Arcade.

3360
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:25,420
6th and 7th floor.

3361
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:29,300
What floor is...

3362
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:31,300
Is it the 5th floor?

3363
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:35,480
The 4th or 5th floor has the At Home.

3364
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:40,800
But there also is the AKB48 theater there as well.

3365
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:44,420
Don Don Don Don Quixote!

3366
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:45,800
Don Quixote!

3367
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:45,960
Don Quixote!

3368
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:48,060
Don Quixote is like a general store.

3369
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,380
Yes, it is.

3370
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:52,420
You can get clothes.

3371
02:07:52,780 --> 02:07:56,220
You can get You can get snacks.

3372
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:58,780
You can get makeup.

3373
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,200
You can get skin care.

3374
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:01,860
You can get costumes.

3375
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:08,320
This particular Don Quixote has a really cute Sanrio section that I like to go check out.

3376
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,960
This is Japanese Walmart.

3377
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:12,220
Basically.

3378
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:13,320
Yeah.

3379
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:16,800
I didn't want to say it but yeah.

3380
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:18,000
Basically.

3381
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:26,440
But it's also this Don Quixote in particular I mean any Don Quixote that you go to in like a major city.

3382
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:27,060
Shibuya.

3383
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:29,000
Shinjuku.

3384
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,080
Akihabara.

3385
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:34,740
You know like the big tourist hot spots.

3386
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:38,740
The Don Quixotes are going to be sooo crowded.

3387
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:42,880
And again, Japan loves to pack so much in a tiny space.

3388
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:44,960
So the aisles are very small.

3389
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:46,480
There's tons of people.

3390
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:51,460
It is very very very very jam packed in there.

3391
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:54,800
So just be aware about that.

3392
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:59,280
But at the bottom here they have they have a crepe place.

3393
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:01,000
They have a takoyaki place.

3394
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,540
I don't remember what the other one is.

3395
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:08,240
It's a great gift spot though.

3396
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:08,860
It is!

3397
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:09,280
Yes!

3398
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:11,640
You can get so much at Don Quixote.

3399
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:12,620
It's crazy.

3400
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:14,400
Yeah yeah.

3401
02:09:17,180 --> 02:09:19,520
And yeah great place to get pen lights.

3402
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:19,900
You can!

3403
02:09:20,140 --> 02:09:21,460
You can get pen lights here.

3404
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:23,260
They have lots of.

3405
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:24,720
You can get UO's here.

3406
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:26,880
I love.

3407
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:27,860
Don't get me wrong.

3408
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:29,020
I love Don Quixote.

3409
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:30,680
I love Don Quixote so much.

3410
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:34,640
I buy stuff from there all the time.

3411
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:38,220
Oh yeah!

3412
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:39,160
There's a Tsukumo.

3413
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:42,160
Ah yeah.

3414
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:42,940
You have traders here.

3415
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:44,540
Another place.

3416
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:45,640
Buy game.

3417
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:47,180
Uh...

3418
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:48,280
Buy game.

3419
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:48,700
Buy...

3420
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:50,500
Um...

3421
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:55,400
They have everything here basically.

3422
02:09:56,820 --> 02:09:58,440
So much stuff here.

3423
02:09:58,640 --> 02:09:59,080
Yeah yeah.

3424
02:09:59,260 --> 02:09:59,660

Audio iPhone.

3429
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:06,220
Traders is a great place to go too.

3430
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:08,000
Yes yes.

3431
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:10,960
What is here?

3432
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:11,840
I don't remember.

3433
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:18,120
Unless it wasn't done.

3434
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:20,640
I don't remember.

3435
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:21,800
I don't remember.

3436
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:22,760
Sorry.

3437
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:25,800
I should like...

3438
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:26,640
I should do like...

3439
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:31,240
In the past I've made videos of me just walking through Akiba.

3440
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:32,220
Like not talking.

3441
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:34,160
Just like walking down the street.

3442
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:36,120
I never posted them anywhere though.

3443
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:37,860
I just always kept them for myself.

3444
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:38,600
So...

3445
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,660
I mean I intended on posting them.

3446
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:42,780
I just never did.

3447
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:45,000
So...

3448
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:46,740
Um... Let's see.

3449
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:48,880
What's some other things that I can think of?

3450
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:50,280
My brain is starting to lose it.

3451
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:52,040
Mother made dream in here.

3452
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:53,560
There's Tsurugaya here.

3453
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:54,480
At least one of them.

3454
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:55,760
There's one Tsurugaya here.

3455
02:10:55,820 --> 02:10:57,040
There's several in Akihabara.

3456
02:10:57,300 --> 02:10:58,020
As well.

3457
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:01,040
Um...

3458
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:05,740
You can't see it but there's the Akiba all here.

3459
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:07,260
Um...

3460
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,380
There's like just small...

3461
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:09,860
What's it called?

3462
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:13,200
Like figure shops and electrics...

3463
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:15,140
Electronic stores and stuff.

3464
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:16,060
As you can see.

3465
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:17,920
Um...

3466
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,760
There's Carl's Jr.

3467
02:11:23,690 --> 02:11:26,420
There's Carl's Jr. Um...

3468
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:28,500
Okay so there's a mocha cat cafe here.

3469
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:37,640
I have heard from friends about mocha cat cafe to maybe don't go.

3470
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:39,640
Even though it's a chain.

3471
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:54,600
But apparently from what my friends have told me they had an incident where they knew that their cats were sick and they just let them continue being sick.

3472
02:11:57,840 --> 02:11:58,580
So...

3473
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:00,040
Um...

3474
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:04,900
I don't know how true that is but I... you know...

3475
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:05,840
But...

3476
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:07,880
But it's what my friends said.

3477
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:09,800
I hope it's not true.

3478
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:14,200
But it has made me weary of going to mocha now.

3479
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:16,920
To this chain.

3480
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,560
And there's mochas in like...

3481
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,380
There's one in Harajuku.

3482
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:20,420
There's one in Shinjuku.

3483
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:23,760
It's a really popular cat cafe chain.

3484
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:24,480
So...

3485
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:29,760
There is a cat cafe though in Akiba that I really like.

3486
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,360
So I will take you guys to that one.

3487
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:35,520
Um...

3488
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,060
I've never been to this meat place.

3489
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:40,040
Maybe Matara would like it.

3490
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:41,500
Because it's meat and wine.

3491
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:43,680
Um...

3492
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:46,200
There's also some other stuff like...

3493
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:46,720
Oh wait...

3494
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:50,060
There's also like an idol...

3495
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:51,160
Um...

3496
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:53,580
Is this where the Ophelia Saga is?

3497
02:12:53,980 --> 02:12:54,940
I think so.

3498
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:57,440
I think this is where the Ophelia is.

3499
02:12:58,120 --> 02:13:00,120
And some other like idol...

3500
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:01,700
Um...

3501
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:04,180
What's the words?

3502
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:05,860
Idol cafes?

3503
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:06,580
Yeah.

3504
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:08,420
Meat wine.

3505
02:13:10,180 --> 02:13:12,660
Idol Carl's Jr. Exactly!

3506
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:13,620
Exactly!

3507
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:19,060
If you need the most inexpensive family restaurant in the entire world.

3508
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:22,840
Saizeria is your man.

3509
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:27,340
Saizeria is an Italian family restaurant.

3510
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:32,920
And it is the most inexpensive restaurant you can probably ever go to ever.

3511
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:34,100
It is so...

3512
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:38,060
It is so cheap.

3513
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:41,340
It's actually so cheap.

3514
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:43,480
If you want...

3515
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:46,140
If you were just going to Japan on a budget.

3516
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:49,180
Saizeria is vaguely Italian.

3517
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:50,980
Is the best way to put it.

3518
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:51,760
Yes!

3519
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:52,840
Vaguely Italian.

3520
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:53,720
Oh!

3521
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:54,740
Um...

3522
02:13:54,740 --> 02:13:59,360
Remember how I mentioned that Nikumansei opened up a new shop.

3523
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:00,020
It's in here.

3524
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:03,220
So uh...

3525
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:04,940
I haven't checked it out yet.

3526
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:07,520
I will go next time I'm in Japan.

3527
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:10,760
Olive Garden too.

3528
02:14:11,020 --> 02:14:11,820
But seriously!

3529
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:16,100
The only thing is because it's so inexpensive and they're open late.

3530
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:18,100
It's very crowded.

3531
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:19,640
There's usually like a line.

3532
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:22,300
So um... Especially if there's an event.

3533
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:23,540
Um...

3534
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:25,480
I like Getsu.

3535
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:28,220
This is a uh...

3536
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:29,940
This is an eroge store.

3537
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:32,560
That I somewhat frequent.

3538
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:34,200
So um...

3539
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:35,600
If I'm brave enough.

3540
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:38,160
Sometimes I'm a little shy and I don't go in.

3541
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:39,080
But uh...

3542
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:42,340
Um...

3543
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:47,030
So...

3544
02:14:47,530 --> 02:14:49,110
If you're looking for eroge...

3545
02:14:49,110 --> 02:14:50,130
Um...

3546
02:14:51,050 --> 02:14:52,390
I like to go there.

3547
02:14:57,610 --> 02:14:58,250
Anyways.

3548
02:14:58,250 --> 02:15:00,250
We're just gonna gloss over that.

3549
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:02,290
There's another Akibao.

3550
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:03,390
Another Akibao.

3551
02:15:04,230 --> 02:15:05,630
Oh you can see it better here.

3552
02:15:06,650 --> 02:15:07,170
Yeah!

3553
02:15:07,430 --> 02:15:08,550
No that's main dream.

3554
02:15:09,990 --> 02:15:10,510
Where?

3555
02:15:12,370 --> 02:15:13,530
Maybe it's in here.

3556
02:15:14,490 --> 02:15:15,010
Oh!

3557
02:15:15,570 --> 02:15:16,570
No just kidding.

3558
02:15:16,710 --> 02:15:17,470
That's a dentist.

3559
02:15:21,350 --> 02:15:22,590
There's another Tsurugaya.

3560
02:15:24,570 --> 02:15:25,710
There's just so much.

3561
02:15:27,190 --> 02:15:27,710
Um...

3562
02:15:28,250 --> 02:15:28,990
Let's keep going.

3563
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:29,330
You know what?

3564
02:15:29,330 --> 02:15:32,430
Let's just keep going down the main road until we get to...

3565
02:15:32,430 --> 02:15:34,610
Until we get to the end of...

3566
02:15:34,610 --> 02:15:35,690
Like the main...

3567
02:15:35,690 --> 02:15:36,590
Main main stuff.

3568
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:39,250
And uh...

3569
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:41,910
Then I'll take you down some of the back roads that we didn't go down before.

3570
02:15:42,230 --> 02:15:43,690
Or that I like avoided.

3571
02:15:44,050 --> 02:15:44,790
Not avoided.

3572
02:15:44,970 --> 02:15:45,730
But you know what I mean.

3573
02:15:46,290 --> 02:15:46,750
Um...

3574
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:50,110
Royal Host is another chain um...

3575
02:15:50,110 --> 02:15:50,810
Family restaurant.

3576
02:15:51,130 --> 02:15:53,850
It's more expensive but the food is actually so good.

3577
02:15:55,410 --> 02:15:56,510
It's actually so good.

3578
02:15:56,730 --> 02:15:57,750
If I ever go to Japan...

3579
02:15:58,250 --> 02:15:59,830
I'm coming out with like $200 of eroge.

3580
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:01,650
The great thing is too...

3581
02:16:01,650 --> 02:16:03,950
Is that you can find so much cheap eroge.

3582
02:16:05,850 --> 02:16:07,990
So $200 would be like...

3583
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:09,010
A ton of stuff.

3584
02:16:10,610 --> 02:16:11,910
It would be so great.

3585
02:16:13,670 --> 02:16:14,870
Obsessed with Royal Host.

3586
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:16,550
Yeah there's also this Tendon place.

3587
02:16:16,970 --> 02:16:18,130
Which is pretty good.

3588
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:18,850
Oh wait!

3589
02:16:20,010 --> 02:16:20,570
Uh...

3590
02:16:20,570 --> 02:16:24,390
The Pepper Lunch is down here.

3591
02:16:25,690 --> 02:16:26,630
I'll take you there.

3592
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:27,190
Obviously.

3593
02:16:28,250 --> 02:16:28,470
This...

3594
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:31,190
This is I'm pretty sure going to be the Appa.

3595
02:16:33,350 --> 02:16:34,110
Does it say?

3596
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:35,730
It doesn't say yet.

3597
02:16:35,790 --> 02:16:36,890
But I'm almost positive.

3598
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:38,910
This is going to be a new Appa Hotel.

3599
02:16:41,870 --> 02:16:42,810
Which is like...

3600
02:16:42,810 --> 02:16:44,210
That makes it like...

3601
02:16:44,210 --> 02:16:45,310
Five in Akiba.

3602
02:16:45,330 --> 02:16:46,030
It's kind of crazy.

3603
02:16:47,870 --> 02:16:49,390
Thank you for the five gifted.

3604
02:16:49,470 --> 02:16:50,070
Thank you.

3605
02:16:51,570 --> 02:16:52,370
Another one?

3606
02:16:52,410 --> 02:16:53,130
I know right?

3607
02:16:53,470 --> 02:16:54,310
Another one.

3608
02:16:54,370 --> 02:16:55,070
It's kind of crazy.

3609
02:16:55,690 --> 02:16:56,130
Um...

3610
02:16:56,130 --> 02:16:57,690
I like this Ramen here.

3611
02:16:58,130 --> 02:17:00,210
The Tonkotsu Ramen here is pretty good.

3612
02:17:00,410 --> 02:17:01,970
I think this is also a chain though.

3613
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:03,370
So it's not just Akiba.

3614
02:17:03,550 --> 02:17:04,410
But I like their stuff.

3615
02:17:04,670 --> 02:17:05,670
There's a um...

3616
02:17:05,670 --> 02:17:07,910
There's some more maid cafes in here.

3617
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:09,930
I'm pretty sure this is also where the um...

3618
02:17:11,010 --> 02:17:12,630
Lillian Plyan moved to.

3619
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:13,630
Which I like them.

3620
02:17:14,190 --> 02:17:15,470
They have two locations.

3621
02:17:16,150 --> 02:17:16,890
Is it here?

3622
02:17:18,490 --> 02:17:19,310
It might be.

3623
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:20,390
I think they did move in here.

3624
02:17:23,250 --> 02:17:23,690
Um...

3625
02:17:23,690 --> 02:17:24,190
Uh...

3626
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:26,530
They're like a cute fairy themed.

3627
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:27,670
Um...

3628
02:17:27,670 --> 02:17:29,010
Maid cafe.

3629
02:17:29,370 --> 02:17:30,390
Very cute.

3630
02:17:31,570 --> 02:17:32,270
Uh...

3631
02:17:35,010 --> 02:17:37,550
There's like a cool figure store here.

3632
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:39,070
Let's see.

3633
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:42,970
Jambara!

3634
02:17:43,110 --> 02:17:45,130
More electronic stuff here.

3635
02:17:46,710 --> 02:17:47,990
Fairy themed?

3636
02:17:48,230 --> 02:17:48,490
Yeah!

3637
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,870
I call this place maid cafe building.

3638
02:17:53,010 --> 02:17:54,190
Because it's all maid cafes.

3639
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:56,310
Except Yakiniku-like.

3640
02:17:57,670 --> 02:17:58,610
At the very bottom.

3641
02:17:59,030 --> 02:18:01,090
Uh... Heart of Hearts used to be up here.

3642
02:18:01,150 --> 02:18:02,550
But actually now it's in um...

3643
02:18:02,550 --> 02:18:04,770
That location where I showed with the witch's garden.

3644
02:18:05,070 --> 02:18:06,450
It actually reopened.

3645
02:18:07,270 --> 02:18:08,470
After a little bit of...

3646
02:18:08,470 --> 02:18:09,830
What seems to be kind of drama.

3647
02:18:10,790 --> 02:18:12,930
Um... But there's several maid cafes in here.

3648
02:18:13,010 --> 02:18:15,530
To get into this... into the maid cafes though.

3649
02:18:15,570 --> 02:18:16,390
You have to go down here.

3650
02:18:17,150 --> 02:18:18,470
Chup, chup, chup, chup, chup.

3651
02:18:18,690 --> 02:18:19,930
Chup, chup, chup, chup, chup.

3652
02:18:20,010 --> 02:18:20,870
And you go down here.

3653
02:18:21,150 --> 02:18:22,170
Chup, chup, chup, chup.

3654
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:26,630
And you enter...

3655
02:18:26,630 --> 02:18:28,330
You enter...

3656
02:18:28,330 --> 02:18:29,710
You enter here.

3657
02:18:31,370 --> 02:18:32,490
So if you see...

3658
02:18:32,490 --> 02:18:33,590
If you're just like, mind escape.

3659
02:18:34,050 --> 02:18:36,250
That sounds like a cool cafe to go to.

3660
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:38,950
You can't get into it on the other way.

3661
02:18:39,270 --> 02:18:40,150
It looks shady.

3662
02:18:40,530 --> 02:18:41,490
Yeah, a little bit.

3663
02:18:41,650 --> 02:18:43,590
But that's just how it is.

3664
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:47,210
That's just how it is, baby.

3665
02:18:47,410 --> 02:18:48,430
Los Tembos!

3666
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:49,590
Thank you for that 10 gifted.

3667
02:18:49,650 --> 02:18:50,210
Thank you!

3668
02:18:51,370 --> 02:18:53,370
Yeah, there's some maid cafes in here as well.

3669
02:18:54,110 --> 02:18:55,370
But I have not been...

3670
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:56,170
Oh my gosh, please.

3671
02:18:56,990 --> 02:18:57,430
Please!

3672
02:18:58,090 --> 02:18:59,630
It's just enough every time.

3673
02:18:59,730 --> 02:19:01,470
I have not been to these ones because...

3674
02:19:01,470 --> 02:19:02,410
I'm not gonna lie.

3675
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:05,010
They kinda look a little shady as well.

3676
02:19:05,830 --> 02:19:06,270
So...

3677
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:09,090
Um...

3678
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:11,090
Let's see.

3679
02:19:11,230 --> 02:19:12,650
So Royal House...

3680
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:14,250
Oh, whoa.

3681
02:19:15,150 --> 02:19:15,590
Okay.

3682
02:19:16,730 --> 02:19:17,990
Let's go back to the main road.

3683
02:19:20,050 --> 02:19:21,490
We're in June 2021.

3684
02:19:21,490 --> 02:19:22,850
No, let's do...

3685
02:19:23,450 --> 02:19:24,370
July 2022.

3686
02:19:25,370 --> 02:19:26,850
As recent as we can get.

3687
02:19:29,050 --> 02:19:30,910
King and Queen was a good stop for a drink.

3688
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:31,890
I've never been...

3689
02:19:31,890 --> 02:19:34,070
There used to be a place called The Alley.

3690
02:19:35,070 --> 02:19:35,990
Which, um...

3691
02:19:37,310 --> 02:19:38,230
Which, uh...

3692
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:40,390
What's the word?

3693
02:19:40,810 --> 02:19:42,170
They had bubble tea.

3694
02:19:42,490 --> 02:19:43,690
Or was it The Alley?

3695
02:19:43,770 --> 02:19:44,250
I think so.

3696
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:46,090
But they had bubble tea.

3697
02:19:46,230 --> 02:19:48,330
Which I would go there a couple times.

3698
02:19:49,150 --> 02:19:49,610
Um...

3699
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:52,850
Let's see...

3700
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:53,510
Um...

3701
02:19:55,390 --> 02:19:57,870
So, one of my favorite places to eat...

3702
02:19:57,870 --> 02:19:58,690
in Akihabara...

3703
02:19:58,690 --> 02:20:00,010
is actually right here.

3704
02:20:00,190 --> 02:20:01,150
This Moss Burger.

3705
02:20:01,930 --> 02:20:03,510
Kind of similar to...

3706
02:20:04,090 --> 02:20:04,570
Fuhomoko.

3707
02:20:04,970 --> 02:20:07,310
It has it, like, you know, with the Mr. Donuts.

3708
02:20:07,330 --> 02:20:10,270
How they like to just eat up top with their Pondering.

3709
02:20:10,450 --> 02:20:12,610
I like to come here and I like to get the...

3710
02:20:12,610 --> 02:20:14,150
Yakiniku Rice Bun Burger.

3711
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:17,070
And I sit up here and I just kind of like to...

3712
02:20:17,070 --> 02:20:19,010
look at Akihabara.

3713
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:19,850
Um...

3714
02:20:21,490 --> 02:20:22,690
It's not as nice as the...

3715
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:24,470
as the Mr. Donuts, but...

3716
02:20:24,470 --> 02:20:25,150
Um...

3717
02:20:26,150 --> 02:20:28,710
But it's still something that I do...

3718
02:20:28,710 --> 02:20:30,830
basically every time I'm in Akihabara.

3719
02:20:30,870 --> 02:20:32,830
Is I go here and I sit at the...

3720
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:33,670
I sit at the...

3721
02:20:33,670 --> 02:20:34,590
Oh, hi people!

3722
02:20:35,250 --> 02:20:38,210
I sit at the little table and I like to...

3723
02:20:38,210 --> 02:20:38,910
Um...

3724
02:20:39,670 --> 02:20:41,830
eat the Rice Bun Burger.

3725
02:20:42,090 --> 02:20:43,190
Because it's the best thing!

3726
02:20:43,290 --> 02:20:46,890
I never order anything else at Moss Burger except the Rice Bun Burger.

3727
02:20:47,170 --> 02:20:48,450
It's most delicious ever.

3728
02:20:49,070 --> 02:20:49,590
Hmm...

3729
02:20:53,310 --> 02:20:53,830
So...

3730
02:20:54,310 --> 02:20:55,190
It's so awesome.

3731
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:55,790
I love...

3732
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:57,670
I like that spot a lot.

3733
02:20:58,670 --> 02:20:59,190
Um...

3734
02:21:00,910 --> 02:21:02,690
Um, a little more down...

3735
02:21:02,690 --> 02:21:04,170
It becomes like...

3736
02:21:04,170 --> 02:21:04,990
a little bit less.

3737
02:21:05,050 --> 02:21:06,650
You get some gacha stores...

3738
02:21:06,650 --> 02:21:07,210
and stuff.

3739
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:08,390
Oh, right here...

3740
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:10,450
is like a big, um...

3741
02:21:10,450 --> 02:21:12,410
It says... it has like the Miku...

3742
02:21:12,410 --> 02:21:13,590
racing right now.

3743
02:21:13,830 --> 02:21:14,230
Um...

3744
02:21:14,230 --> 02:21:16,650
It's... for a while it's been like...

3745
02:21:16,650 --> 02:21:18,370
kind of a Good Smile store?

3746
02:21:19,410 --> 02:21:20,530
Not Good Smile...

3747
02:21:20,530 --> 02:21:21,690
But it... is it Good Smile?

3748
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:24,190
It has... it has like racing Miku...

3749
02:21:24,190 --> 02:21:25,890
and they have like some other figures...

3750
02:21:25,890 --> 02:21:29,090
and um...

3751
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:29,890
Uh...

3752
02:21:30,490 --> 02:21:31,910
Is Good Smile HQ?

3753
02:21:32,770 --> 02:21:33,610
No way!

3754
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:34,570
What?

3755
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:45,340
But it's still here!

3756
02:21:45,540 --> 02:21:46,300
It's still here!

3757
02:21:46,660 --> 02:21:48,400
It's um... it's just like... they have the...

3758
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:51,600
This looks like it's just a racing Miku...

3759
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:53,380
like pop-up... but they do...

3760
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:55,120
still have racing Miku stuff inside.

3761
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:56,800
They just have other figures as well.

3762
02:21:57,240 --> 02:21:59,160
Um... like they have like some...

3763
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:01,200
pop-up parade things and they have...

3764
02:22:01,720 --> 02:22:02,860
uh... just like...

3765
02:22:02,860 --> 02:22:04,580
just like some general figure stuff.

3766
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:06,980
Mm-mm-mm...

3767
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,460
There used to be a...

3768
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:11,120
scam postcard store right around here.

3769
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:11,960
But this one?

3770
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:15,220
This one?

3771
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:17,420
With the lady that always tries to get you to...

3772
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:17,680
go in?

3773
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:21,380
Uh... this chat time is not...

3774
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:22,780
here anymore, which makes me so sad.

3775
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:24,080
It was a bubble tea place.

3776
02:22:25,180 --> 02:22:25,780
Ahem.

3777
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:31,720
It's funny because in the game Akiba's Trip, you like fight these ladies.

3778
02:22:33,380 --> 02:22:38,820
You fight these ladies because they're always so pushy about getting you to buy the art.

3779
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:41,600
So annoying.

3780
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:45,300
Um... down here is another...

3781
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:47,080
Oh... wait... what... we... okay... 2019.

3782
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,320
I was gonna say this is...

3783
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:51,040
I think it's... this building?

3784
02:22:51,340 --> 02:22:52,320
Or this building?

3785
02:22:53,400 --> 02:22:55,060
One of these buildings is another...

3786
02:22:55,940 --> 02:22:57,060
um... made...

3787
02:22:57,060 --> 02:22:57,340
Oh!

3788
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:58,440
Made cafe building.

3789
02:22:58,620 --> 02:22:59,100
Okay, let's see.

3790
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,640
This one.

3791
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:01,960
I was close.

3792
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,900
This is another, like, very made cafe.

3793
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:07,880
There's a bunch of different themes here.

3794
02:23:08,180 --> 02:23:09,560
Um... one of them is a Vtuber.

3795
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:10,660
I think it's this one.

3796
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:12,800
It's the Vtuber themed cafe.

3797
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:18,920
I still haven't gone because I'm very... someone once said that it was weird.

3798
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:20,780
When they went.

3799
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:23,280
So... I'm still deciding.

3800
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:24,880
Is that Picardine?

3801
02:23:26,860 --> 02:23:28,140
That might be Picardine.

3802
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:30,780
But yeah, there's lots of made cafes and themed cafes.

3803
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:32,700
I mean, this one's a cheerleading themed one.

3804
02:23:32,740 --> 02:23:33,980
Not necessarily a made cafe.

3805
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:35,440
How weird?

3806
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:36,160
I don't know.

3807
02:23:36,980 --> 02:23:38,340
I'm gonna go next time.

3808
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:40,920
I'm gonna go next time.

3809
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:45,180
I'm gonna get over my fears.

3810
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:47,280
Of the weird cafe.

3811
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:50,640
I won't tell them I'm a Vtuber.

3812
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:51,080
I won't tell them I'm a Vtuber.

3813
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:52,400
Oh yeah, see?

3814
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:55,060
You can kind of see it's closed off.

3815
02:23:55,220 --> 02:23:57,940
But it is, it is, like, open all the time now.

3816
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:02,960
It used to always be, like, from every time I saw it, it was like a Miku...

3817
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:05,300
A Miku...

3818
02:24:10,380 --> 02:24:11,900
Miku, like, exhibition type thing.

3819
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:12,860
Great tour!

3820
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:14,220
Have you watched Akiba Made War?

3821
02:24:14,220 --> 02:24:15,120
Hi, Sketch!

3822
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:15,680
Thank you!

3823
02:24:15,740 --> 02:24:17,280
I'm actually in the middle of watching it.

3824
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:19,040
I watched an episode right before the stream.

3825
02:24:20,060 --> 02:24:21,920
I don't remember what episode I'm on, though.

3826
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:24,140
I'm on episode, like, five?

3827
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:25,300
I think?

3828
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:32,440
If you're into Hello Project, there's the big Hello Project store here.

3829
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:35,160
There's also some other hobby stores up in here.

3830
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:37,420
An army store.

3831
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:40,700
This hobby shop that has a bunch of, like, military stuff.

3832
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:43,760
I've only been once.

3833
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:45,640
Um...

3834
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:47,240
Well, yeah!

3835
02:24:47,540 --> 02:24:53,620
The quote-unquote main Akiba stuff really kind of ends here.

3836
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:54,880
But also not!

3837
02:24:57,180 --> 02:24:59,000
There's also a bunch of... See?

3838
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:00,740
Chuo-dori Avenue.

3839
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:04,000
So Chuo-dori is this main street here.

3840
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:05,460
Um...

3841
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:08,980
There's some other stuff I want to show.

3842
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,260
Some, like, little things, like, off the beaten path.

3843
02:25:12,820 --> 02:25:14,980
Um, if you come down this way...

3844
02:25:14,980 --> 02:25:20,020
I always use Tam Tam as, like, my marker.

3845
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,500
It's like my...

3846
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:26,700
It's my big marker here.

3847
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:29,860
Let's see...

3848
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:31,240
Um...

3849
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:32,720
This way.

3850
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:40,860
Oh, here.

3851
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,700
So this is a...

3852
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:44,820
This is a cafe called...

3853
02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:48,520
Fruits de saison?

3854
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:49,480
I think?

3855
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:50,480
Does it say?

3856
02:25:52,510 --> 02:25:56,860
Furu Fudu Saison is what's covered up.

3857
02:25:57,080 --> 02:26:01,840
Furu Fudu Saison And basically...

3858
02:26:02,690 --> 02:26:04,660
It's the most delicious...

3859
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:06,700
It's so...

3860
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:07,580
Awesome!

3861
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:09,080
They're so delicious.

3862
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:11,280
They are, um...

3863
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:13,580
So, as the title implies...

3864
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:16,580
The fruits change each season.

3865
02:26:16,820 --> 02:26:17,640
So...

3866
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:19,480
They, uh...

3867
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:21,040
They, um...

3868
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:23,640
Only have whatever fruit is in...

3869
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:23,720
Oh!

3870
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:25,500
Oh, we're back!

3871
02:26:26,020 --> 02:26:26,860
Hello?

3872
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:29,520
Hello?

3873
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:34,360
Just refresh.

3874
02:26:37,580 --> 02:26:38,880
They got her.

3875
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:41,240
We're back?

3876
02:26:41,380 --> 02:26:41,840
Okay, sorry.

3877
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:42,880
Sorry about that.

3878
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:45,060
So this is Furu Fudu Saison.

3879
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:47,860
And like I said...

3880
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:49,640
As the title implies...

3881
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:50,400
They...

3882
02:26:50,400 --> 02:26:53,180
They serve parfaits...

3883
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:55,140
Based on what fruit is in season.

3884
02:26:56,260 --> 02:26:57,420
So, um...

3885
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:59,820
So you'll only get stuff that is...

3886
02:27:00,280 --> 02:27:01,460
Of that season.

3887
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:03,060
And like the menu is very...

3888
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:05,040
It changes all the time.

3889
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:06,240
It's so good.

3890
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:11,100
It's so good.

3891
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:12,480
It's so good.

3892
02:27:12,480 --> 02:27:13,700
I don't know why it's called Fruf.

3893
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:16,760
But it says Fruits Parfait.

3894
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:18,080
But it says Fruits Parfait.

3895
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:18,620
Or does that say...

3896
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:21,600
That's...

3897
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:22,340
That's...

3898
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:24,920
I don't know.

3899
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:28,680
But I highly recommend this place.

3900
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:28,760
But I highly recommend this place.

3901
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:29,780
It's really, really delicious.

3902
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:31,400
It's so good.

3903
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:33,600
Fruf du Saison.

3904
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:36,040
But also here...

3905
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:37,880
Is a place that I love to go to...

3906
02:27:37,880 --> 02:27:38,760
All the time.

3907
02:27:38,860 --> 02:27:39,140
Oh my god!

3908
02:27:39,260 --> 02:27:40,580
Shiratama Sensei!

3909
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:42,540
It's called Blend Dream Candy.

3910
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:44,040
And if you love...

3911
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:45,720
Blend Dream Park...

3912
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:49,580
If you like doujin artists...

3913
02:27:49,580 --> 02:27:51,140
I love their apple pie.

3914
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:52,040
Yeah!

3915
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:55,700
I'll have to try it...

3916
02:27:55,700 --> 02:27:56,380
Next time!

3917
02:27:56,520 --> 02:27:59,680
If you like...

3918
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:01,560
Doujin artists and stuff...

3919
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:03,760
This is a store of just...

3920
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:05,020
Like gachapon...

3921
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:07,440
And tapestries...

3922
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:08,140
And...

3923
02:28:08,140 --> 02:28:10,520
It's mostly gachapon, I'll be honest.

3924
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:13,320
But they have like vending machines of art...

3925
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:14,480
Of like tapestries...

3926
02:28:14,480 --> 02:28:17,740
And various goods of different artists...

3927
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:19,860
Like Shiratama Sensei...

3928
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:21,580
And Pan no Mimi...

3929
02:28:21,580 --> 02:28:22,220
And...

3930
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:24,880
Kantoku...

3931
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:26,040
And...

3932
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:26,820
And...

3933
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:27,280
Hmmm...

3934
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:28,160
Hmmm...

3935
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:29,260
Hmmm...

3936
02:28:31,540 --> 02:28:34,000
Very adorable, very humorous...

3937
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:36,220
Humorous?

3938
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:37,880
What's so funny?

3939
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:40,600
What's so funny?

3940
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:41,600
What's so funny?

3941
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:42,740
But...

3942
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:43,340
Yeah!

3943
02:28:46,460 --> 02:28:48,240
I like this place.

3944
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:50,480
I like to come here and get their gachapon.

3945
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:53,980
But if you're wondering...

3946
02:28:53,980 --> 02:28:54,840
Where is this?

3947
02:28:56,820 --> 02:28:58,580
This is like the most random side street ever.

3948
02:28:58,760 --> 02:29:01,260
If you go down this street all the way...

3949
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:02,640
Which I'm gonna show you...

3950
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:04,280
Which actually...

3951
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:04,840
It's kinda fun.

3952
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:06,840
Right here is the fire department.

3953
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:09,500
You can see their own little anime mascot.

3954
02:29:11,500 --> 02:29:14,040
The fire department has their own anime mascot.

3955
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:31,800
Sorry, I'm skipping a bunch of places.

3956
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:32,460
But...

3957
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:35,020
Trying to show as much as possible.

3958
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:36,300
Look at that!

3959
02:29:36,860 --> 02:29:37,940
We're back at the station!

3960
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:39,480
There's Tamashii Nations.

3961
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:41,060
There's the station.

3962
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:43,220
There's UDX.

3963
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:44,540
Oh, sorry.

3964
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:46,060
There's UDX.

3965
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:48,700
Yeah!

3966
02:29:50,280 --> 02:29:52,580
So it's just a little bit of a walk from there.

3967
02:29:53,380 --> 02:29:54,000
Damn dragon!

3968
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:54,840
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

3969
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:57,020
Yeah, we went in a full circle!

3970
02:29:58,220 --> 02:30:00,500
I'm actually gonna go back down this way too.

3971
02:30:00,860 --> 02:30:01,320
I'm actually gonna go back down this way too.

3972
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:03,220
Because there's something else I wanted to show.

3973
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:14,040
More, more, more.

3974
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:18,940
Did you know you can walk inside M's on Google Maps?

3975
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:19,280
Did you know you can walk inside M's on Google Maps?

3976
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:19,920
Wait, I tried!

3977
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:22,320
I tried!

3978
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:23,600
How do you do it?

3979
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:25,060
What do you do?

3980
02:30:25,960 --> 02:30:26,980
Fellow kids.

3981
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:33,180
Cute.

3982
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:42,000

Thank you for the raid, Ami!

3984
02:30:47,820 --> 02:30:48,760
Thank you!

3985
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:52,460
Froggers!

3986
02:30:55,860 --> 02:30:56,780
Hello everybody!

02:30:57,360 --> 02:30:59,280

3988
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:00,380
My favorite place ever.

3989
02:31:00,860 --> 02:31:03,300
I've kind of shown a lot of stuff already.

3990
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:03,860
But...

3991
02:31:06,140 --> 02:31:06,960

Thank you guys!

4006
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:32,440
Let me see...

4007
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:34,560
I actually am so curious if this is here.

4008
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:38,460
I'm so curious.

4009
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:40,000
Well, first off...

4010
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,700
Actually, where...

4011
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:43,120
Okay, hold on.

4012
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:46,460
I'm gonna be checking sideways every so often.

4013
02:31:46,940 --> 02:31:47,560
It's that!

4014
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:49,540
Wait, can I go in there?

4015
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:50,080
This!

4016
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:59,080
If you guys follow Ayami-sensei, This is where she had her collaboration cafe with Asan Cafe.

4017
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:00,160
So it was here.

4018
02:32:00,620 --> 02:32:01,440
But it's this!

4019
02:32:03,640 --> 02:32:04,080
No!

4020
02:32:04,180 --> 02:32:04,480
Wait!

4021
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:05,940
You can see him!

4022
02:32:06,220 --> 02:32:08,380
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

4023
02:32:08,500 --> 02:32:12,000
Do you guys want to see the scariest thing?

4024
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:13,200
Hold on, I have to...

4025
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:15,440
I have to send it to...

4026
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:16,140
Oops, that's TikTok.

4027
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:16,880
Don't listen.

4028
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:18,560
I have to send it to myself.

4029
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:19,980
You can see his reflection!

4030
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:22,180
Okay, so imagine...

4031
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:25,580
Hold on, I have to find the picture.

4032
02:32:25,660 --> 02:32:31,220
Actually, imagine you're walking down the street at night in Akihabara.

4033
02:32:33,160 --> 02:32:35,420
Actually, I walk this way because...

4034
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:37,760
I walk this way!

4035
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:38,800
No.

4036
02:32:38,900 --> 02:32:41,120
I walk this way because I...

4037
02:32:42,040 --> 02:32:45,600
I had some friends that were staying down the street.

4038
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:47,940
And so I was going to meet them.

4039
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:49,200
And it was dark.

4040
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:50,520
It was night time.

4041
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:52,780
It was, you know...

4042
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:55,200
I don't want to say it was quite late.

4043
02:32:55,400 --> 02:32:56,960
But it was, you know...

4044
02:32:57,560 --> 02:32:59,520
The sun had set.

4045
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:02,100
Where is this picture?

4046
02:33:02,580 --> 02:33:06,040
Can you guys tell what it is from the reflection?

4047
02:33:07,980 --> 02:33:10,240
And this is from July of 2022.

4048
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:12,760
So, um...

4049
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:15,480
I just want to let you know that.

4050
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:18,380
Where is this picture?

4051
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:19,940
Hold on, I'm going to find it.

4052
02:33:20,140 --> 02:33:20,940
I'm so sorry.

4053
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:23,240
I should have had this prepared.

4054
02:33:23,900 --> 02:33:25,940
But I actually didn't even know if he was going to be there.

4055
02:33:29,620 --> 02:33:30,040
Mothra?

4056
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:30,800
A clown?

4057
02:33:32,300 --> 02:33:32,720
Close.

4058
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:34,040
Maybe.

4059
02:33:35,140 --> 02:33:36,080
A bird man.

4060
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:37,740
Flamingo.

4061
02:33:37,800 --> 02:33:39,140
Why flamingo?

4062
02:33:40,340 --> 02:33:41,680
Where is this picture?

4063
02:33:43,900 --> 02:33:44,720
Oh, wait.

4064
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:45,680
I think I'm close.

4065
02:33:48,540 --> 02:33:48,980
Oh!

4066
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:49,840
I found it!

4067
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:50,600
I found it!

4068
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:51,940
I found it.

4069
02:33:55,460 --> 02:33:56,320
I found it!

4070
02:33:56,400 --> 02:33:56,640
Okay.

4071
02:34:00,220 --> 02:34:01,320
Let me pull it up.

4072
02:34:04,960 --> 02:34:05,820
Uh, wait.

4073
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:08,900
Wait.

4074
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:09,700
Uh, one second.

4075
02:34:10,460 --> 02:34:10,900
Sorry.

4076
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:13,460
Um...

4077
02:34:16,250 --> 02:34:17,130
One second.

4078
02:34:17,330 --> 02:34:21,330
I didn't want to accidentally open the pictures in the wrong browser.

4079
02:34:21,510 --> 02:34:22,430
Which is why I hid it.

4080
02:34:23,410 --> 02:34:23,890
Sorry.

4081
02:34:24,070 --> 02:34:24,670
One second.

4082
02:34:26,570 --> 02:34:28,830
Uh, and also let me check for reflection.

4083
02:34:34,390 --> 02:34:34,870
So...

4084
02:34:36,930 --> 02:34:38,510
You're walking down the street.

4085
02:34:42,410 --> 02:34:43,990
And you see him.

4086
02:34:44,170 --> 02:34:44,530
Oh.

4087
02:34:49,940 --> 02:34:52,180
It's dark and you lost your way.

4088
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:53,100
It's dark and you lost your way.

4089
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:55,040
You don't know where you're going.

4090
02:34:55,220 --> 02:34:55,600
You don't know where you're going.

4091
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:58,140
But you hear a rustle behind...

4092
02:34:58,140 --> 02:34:58,220
But you hear a rustle behind...

4093
02:34:58,220 --> 02:34:59,620
In a dark alleyway.

4094
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:02,360
You turn, confused.

4095
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:04,900
And who else could it be?

4096
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:07,180
Actual cannibal...

4097
02:35:07,180 --> 02:35:08,840
Olaf from Frozen.

4098
02:35:13,630 --> 02:35:15,470
Do you see it now?

4099
02:35:15,590 --> 02:35:16,230
Do you see it now?

4100
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,400
Do you see it now?

4101
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:28,080
With the reflection and then the picture?

4102
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:31,840
Do you see it now?

4103
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:34,660
This is what I saw walking home at night.

4104
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:37,660
It scared the actual crap out of me.

4105
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:37,820
It scared the actual crap out of me.

4106
02:35:37,820 --> 02:35:39,300
I was like, oh my god!

4107
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:42,900
I don't know why he's there.

4108
02:35:44,460 --> 02:35:45,560
Actual cannibal.

4109
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:47,040
Olaf from Frozen.

4110
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:48,640
Is real.

4111
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:53,740
And he exists in this building.

4112
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:57,420
Yorozuya 7 Biru.

4113
02:35:59,300 --> 02:36:01,000
Across from Asan Cafe.

4114
02:36:01,420 --> 02:36:03,720
And clearly, this is from July 22.

4115
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:05,440
Uh, 2020...

4116
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:05,980
2022.

4117
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:07,300
So...

4118
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:07,700
Scary.

4119
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:08,660
It's scary, right?

4120
02:36:11,660 --> 02:36:13,180
Um, so...

4121
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:13,880
Woah.

4122
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,220
My phone just fell.

4123
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:15,440
Sorry.

4124
02:36:15,560 --> 02:36:18,380
Um, so he's been there for several years now.

4125
02:36:20,260 --> 02:36:21,540
Um, so he's been there for several years now.

4126
02:36:21,540 --> 02:36:25,240
Um, so you can probably go to this place and visit scary Olaf.

4127
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:25,660
Um, so you can probably go to this place and visit scary Olaf.

4128
02:36:25,660 --> 02:36:27,920
Again, he's across from Cafe Asan.

4129
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:29,720
This is a real mystery.

4130
02:36:29,900 --> 02:36:30,120
Have you seen it?

4131
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:31,880
Bajamin.

4132
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:33,260
That Olaf.

4133
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:37,460
Why... why am I here?

4134
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:38,780
Why am I here?

4135
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:40,320
Why?

4136
02:36:42,780 --> 02:36:43,660
Isn't it too scary?

4137
02:36:43,820 --> 02:36:44,180
Isn't it too scary?

4138
02:36:48,780 --> 02:36:49,340
Why am I here?

4139
02:36:49,340 --> 02:36:50,040
Olaf is scary scary.

4140
02:36:51,360 --> 02:36:56,480
Anyway, I just wanted to share the Blendream and the Cafe Asan.

4141
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:58,620
Wait, how do I get out of here?

4142
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:00,160
Let me out!

4143
02:37:01,320 --> 02:37:02,020
I have it.

4144
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:03,360
I have it since last year.

4145
02:37:04,620 --> 02:37:05,420
Since last year?

4146
02:37:05,420 --> 02:37:05,620
Since last year?

4147
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:16,480
Since 2022.

4148
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:19,640
Since 2022.

4149
02:37:21,900 --> 02:37:23,320
This is June!

4150
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:25,320
And he's holding like a...

4151
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:26,220
He's holding a...

4152
02:37:27,140 --> 02:37:27,900
Oh my gosh.

4153
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:28,300
I think I...

4154
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:28,680
Oh, there we go.

4155
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:30,680
He's holding a candy bucket.

4156
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:31,660
Like a Halloween bucket.

4157
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:34,540
So, I thought he was like a Halloween...

4158
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:36,540
Like prop?

4159
02:37:36,660 --> 02:37:37,340
But, no.

4160
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:38,760
I don't know.

4161
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:41,260
That Olaf is so terrifying.

4162
02:37:41,560 --> 02:37:42,660
It's so scary.

4163
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:45,860
It's so scary.

4164
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:48,220
It's so funny to see.

4165
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:50,600
Oh, I like this hotel here.

4166
02:37:52,280 --> 02:37:53,120
This hotel...

4167
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:54,320
Oh, here.

4168
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:55,700
You can see the name.

4169
02:37:55,860 --> 02:37:57,600
The Dormy Inn Akihabara.

4170
02:37:57,720 --> 02:38:01,940
I really like because at the top, right up here, is...

4171
02:38:01,940 --> 02:38:04,060
is an onsen.

4172
02:38:04,220 --> 02:38:05,840
It's an outdoor onsen.

4173
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:08,580
It's not very big.

4174
02:38:08,780 --> 02:38:11,460
But it's Dormy Inn Goated.

4175
02:38:11,560 --> 02:38:11,840
Yeah!

4176
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,420
It's really nice.

4177
02:38:15,180 --> 02:38:16,740
So, it's also...

4178
02:38:16,740 --> 02:38:20,220
The rooms are like kind of more Japanese style.

4179
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:22,520
Like they have the tatami mats and everything like that.

4180
02:38:23,640 --> 02:38:24,280
But...

4181
02:38:25,240 --> 02:38:26,320
Dormy Inn rocks.

4182
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:26,920
Yeah!

4183
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:29,260
Um...

4184
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:31,920
But...

4185
02:38:33,120 --> 02:38:34,740
And it's quite affordable.

4186
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:36,800
I think it still counts as a...

4187
02:38:37,980 --> 02:38:39,220
As a business hotel.

4188
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:40,640
So, it's quite affordable.

4189
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:41,360
And...

4190
02:38:42,740 --> 02:38:45,320
You can use the onsen for free.

4191
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:50,620
Do you like the Idol Master Mint?

4192
02:38:50,700 --> 02:38:51,300
Yeah, I do!

4193
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:54,620
Didn't know there was an onsen in Akihabara.

4194
02:38:54,760 --> 02:38:55,680
It's like...

4195
02:38:56,980 --> 02:38:58,320
Onsen maybe in quotes.

4196
02:38:58,380 --> 02:38:59,400
But it's still really nice.

4197
02:39:01,100 --> 02:39:03,560
I stayed at the Dormy Inn across from Tokyo Dome last month.

4198
02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:04,140
It was amazing.

4199
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:04,920
Oh, nice!

4200
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:07,000
Yes, also I should mention it is a chain.

4201
02:39:07,460 --> 02:39:07,880
So...

4202
02:39:10,980 --> 02:39:13,000
It's not like you have to stay only at this one.

4203
02:39:13,660 --> 02:39:15,600
There are Dormy Inns at other places.

4204
02:39:15,660 --> 02:39:17,640
And I believe they all have the onsen at the top.

4205
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:18,400
So it's pretty nice.

4206
02:39:19,360 --> 02:39:19,780
Um...

4207
02:39:19,780 --> 02:39:23,100
Also, if you didn't realize, we're back to...

4208
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:24,540
Chuo-dori.

4209
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:27,240
But you might also notice...

4210
02:39:27,240 --> 02:39:28,280
There is a...

4211
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:30,260
Train station here.

4212
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:33,480
This is for the metro.

4213
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:35,500
Which um...

4214
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:36,900
You saw...

4215
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:38,860
There was the metro for Akihabara station.

4216
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:39,900
Oh, there's Pepper Lunch!

4217
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:44,700
But the metro for Akihabara station is the Hibiya Line.

4218
02:39:45,300 --> 02:39:45,820
But the metro for Akihabara station is the Hibiya Line.

4219
02:39:45,820 --> 02:39:47,100
This is actually um...

4220
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:49,480
This is actually um...

4221
02:39:49,480 --> 02:39:51,420
Hold on, I'm trying to get the name so you can see it.

4222
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:53,120
Uh...

4223
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:55,720
Uh...

4224
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:57,740
What is this?

4225
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:58,260
I'm not sure yet.

4226
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:02,540
There we go.

4227
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:05,160
Sui...

4228
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:07,100
Suihirocho.

4229
02:40:08,320 --> 02:40:08,840
So...

4230
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:11,860
If you are coming to Akihabara...

4231
02:40:13,360 --> 02:40:14,540
And you're just like...

4232
02:40:14,540 --> 02:40:17,020
Ah, my hotel is not...

4233
02:40:17,720 --> 02:40:18,420
Is not...

4234
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:21,420
It does not go directly to Akihabara.

4235
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:23,800
You could also check to see...

4236
02:40:23,800 --> 02:40:25,300
If it goes to Suihirocho.

4237
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:26,520
Because...

4238
02:40:27,980 --> 02:40:28,500
Um...

4239
02:40:29,020 --> 02:40:31,120
This will also lead you...

4240
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:32,740
Exactly on Chuo-dori.

4241
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:33,840
On the main street.

4242
02:40:34,480 --> 02:40:36,220
So it's not um...

4243
02:40:36,220 --> 02:40:38,380
It's not like Akiba station proper.

4244
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:41,340
But it is still in the heart of Akihabara.

4245
02:40:41,500 --> 02:40:43,180
And then there's, you know, the exit here.

4246
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:45,480
Or exit entrance here.

4247
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:47,040
Exit entrance over there.

4248
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:49,360
Yes, the Ginza Line.

4249
02:40:49,420 --> 02:40:50,040
You can see...

4250
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:51,940
You can see it's the orange one right there.

4251
02:40:51,940 --> 02:40:53,400
Um, there is...

4252
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:55,860
There are a couple other train stations you can take.

4253
02:40:56,060 --> 02:40:56,500
Um...

4254
02:40:56,500 --> 02:40:57,780
What was one?

4255
02:40:58,200 --> 02:40:59,440
Hold on, let me check.

4256
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:01,000
I can't remember the name.

4257
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:03,140
Um...

4258
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:04,600
Hold on, I'm gonna check from maps.

4259
02:41:05,100 --> 02:41:06,920
There's another one that takes you...

4260
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:08,380
It's a little bit more of a walk.

4261
02:41:08,460 --> 02:41:10,740
But by a walk, I mean like 2 minutes.

4262
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:11,640
It's not even that long.

4263
02:41:15,320 --> 02:41:15,760
Um...

4264
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:17,080
Mmm...

4265
02:41:18,140 --> 02:41:18,580
Directions...

4266
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:21,620
To Akihabara...

4267
02:41:21,940 --> 02:41:22,340
Directions to Akihabara...

4268
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:23,540
Directions to Akihabara...

4269
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:29,540
The other station is...

4270
02:41:29,540 --> 02:41:32,340
The other station is...

4271
02:41:32,340 --> 02:41:32,860
Wait, here we go.

4272
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:33,380
Train station.

4273
02:41:34,400 --> 02:41:35,440
Is, um...

4274
02:41:35,980 --> 02:41:36,600
Ogawa-machi.

4275
02:41:37,460 --> 02:41:38,300
Ogawa-machi.

4276
02:41:38,980 --> 02:41:41,060
Oh, there is also Okachimachi, yeah.

4277
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:43,980
But Ogawa-machi takes you...

4278
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:44,300
Um...

4279
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:47,360
Takes you...

4280
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:48,020
It's like...

4281
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:50,180
I would have to go kind of far.

4282
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:51,560
It's kind of all the way...

4283
02:41:53,980 --> 02:41:54,380
To Akihabara station.

4284
02:41:55,540 --> 02:41:57,460
But it drops you off like...

4285
02:41:57,900 --> 02:42:00,440
Like maybe like a 3 minute walk...

4286
02:42:00,440 --> 02:42:01,420
To...

4287
02:42:01,980 --> 02:42:02,500
Um...

4288
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:04,480
To like Pasela area.

4289
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:07,400
So...

4290
02:42:07,400 --> 02:42:09,560
If you're like trying to get to Akihabara...

4291
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:11,940
I would definitely look at some stations...

4292
02:42:11,940 --> 02:42:13,620
Around as well because...

4293
02:42:13,620 --> 02:42:16,280
Not all of them are going to lead to...

4294
02:42:16,280 --> 02:42:17,960
Akihabara station proper.

4295
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:20,040
But you could maybe find...

4296
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:21,700
I mean Google maps will do that for you, right?

4297
02:42:21,700 --> 02:42:22,120
Like...

4298
02:42:22,580 --> 02:42:25,380
Google maps will find you the best way to get there but...

4299
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:26,300
Um...

4300
02:42:26,980 --> 02:42:29,240
You know, you don't have to go to...

4301
02:42:29,240 --> 02:42:29,460
Whoa!

4302
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,160
Where are we here?

4303
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:33,820
You don't have to go to Akihabara station proper.

4304
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:35,700
There's a couple others around too.

4305
02:42:37,540 --> 02:42:38,700
Wow, Japan has CBD.

4306
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:39,720
I know, right?

4307
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:41,340
It's so weird to see now.

4308
02:42:43,340 --> 02:42:45,140
It's really weird to see.

4309
02:42:46,900 --> 02:42:48,200
I'm trying to get in here.

4310
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:50,640
So...

4311
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:52,430
If we're going to go down some of the back streets...

4312
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:53,260
Now...

4313
02:42:54,360 --> 02:42:55,380
There's culture zone.

4314
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:56,740
So...

4315
02:42:58,060 --> 02:43:00,400
Akihabara seems huge and small...

4316
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:01,420
All at the same time.

4317
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:04,140
It's so big and small...

4318
02:43:04,140 --> 02:43:05,180
All at the same time.

4319
02:43:05,820 --> 02:43:06,360
Where?

4320
02:43:21,430 --> 02:43:21,970
Dolphin.

4321
02:43:23,410 --> 02:43:23,690
Dolphin.

4322
02:43:27,550 --> 02:43:28,750
I can't tell.

4323
02:43:29,810 --> 02:43:30,810
Where am I?

4324
02:43:31,570 --> 02:43:33,590
I know where I am but like...

4325
02:43:34,190 --> 02:43:35,450
I'm trying to figure out...

4326
02:43:35,450 --> 02:43:35,830
Okay, hold on.

4327
02:43:36,470 --> 02:43:37,270
Okay, hold on.

4328
02:43:39,830 --> 02:43:41,330
For some reason...

4329
02:43:41,330 --> 02:43:42,850
I always...

4330
02:43:44,990 --> 02:43:46,630
If I'm looking this way...

4331
02:43:47,290 --> 02:43:49,630
It's more confusing than if I'm looking this way.

4332
02:43:49,930 --> 02:43:50,890
I don't know why.

4333
02:43:51,630 --> 02:43:52,370
I don't know why.

4334
02:43:53,410 --> 02:43:53,550
Bunny Garden!

4335
02:43:55,970 --> 02:43:56,510
Yes!

4336
02:43:56,890 --> 02:43:57,330
Okay.

4337
02:43:59,730 --> 02:44:00,270
Okay.

4338
02:44:00,270 --> 02:44:00,810
Yes!

4339
02:44:00,930 --> 02:44:01,430
This is...

4340
02:44:03,030 --> 02:44:03,570
Yes!

4341
02:44:03,850 --> 02:44:05,570
Okay, that's why I kept turning around.

4342
02:44:05,810 --> 02:44:07,350
This is the Bunny Garden Street!

4343
02:44:08,310 --> 02:44:09,110
Right here!

4344
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:12,910
This is the Bunny Garden Street.

4345
02:44:12,990 --> 02:44:13,550
Right here.

4346
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:14,850
And so...

4347
02:44:14,850 --> 02:44:15,990
Not here.

4348
02:44:18,730 --> 02:44:19,270
This...

4349
02:44:20,350 --> 02:44:24,470
This is where the Chubby Girl Made Cafe is.

4350
02:44:26,850 --> 02:44:27,490
This is where the Chubby Girl Made Cafe is.

4351
02:44:28,950 --> 02:44:30,610
Homemade Cafe and Dining...

4352
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:31,470
Honey, honey...

4353
02:44:31,470 --> 02:44:33,130
I've never been here before but...

4354
02:44:34,070 --> 02:44:35,790
This is where it's at.

4355
02:44:37,050 --> 02:44:38,530
In case you are...

4356
02:44:39,270 --> 02:44:40,350
Trying to find it.

4357
02:44:41,070 --> 02:44:42,730
Changri Da is here.

4358
02:44:43,010 --> 02:44:43,930
You're welcome.

4359
02:44:45,950 --> 02:44:46,950
You're welcome.

4360
02:44:46,950 --> 02:44:48,410
Everybody who's been like...

4361
02:44:48,410 --> 02:44:49,190
Where is it?

4362
02:44:50,730 --> 02:44:51,170
Yeah.

4363
02:44:53,290 --> 02:44:54,030
I was like...

4364
02:44:54,030 --> 02:44:55,070
I know it's here.

4365
02:44:55,310 --> 02:44:55,770
I was like...

4366
02:44:55,770 --> 02:44:58,290
I thought it was either this street or this one street over.

4367
02:44:58,450 --> 02:44:58,890
But I was like...

4368
02:44:58,890 --> 02:45:00,530
No, I'm pretty sure it's this one.

4369
02:45:01,050 --> 02:45:03,770
Of course, there's the Hard Off and the Hobby Off.

4370
02:45:07,170 --> 02:45:08,330
There's some kebabs.

4371
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:09,650
There's kebabs!

4372
02:45:10,210 --> 02:45:12,230
There's always the Star Kebab which is like...

4373
02:45:12,230 --> 02:45:13,710
The more popular one.

4374
02:45:13,710 --> 02:45:15,710
Which they closed down for a while.

4375
02:45:15,830 --> 02:45:17,050
And then they opened back up.

4376
02:45:20,030 --> 02:45:21,510
Which is right...

4377
02:45:26,090 --> 02:45:26,530
Oh!

4378
02:45:26,530 --> 02:45:27,770
I mentioned...

4379
02:45:27,770 --> 02:45:28,250
Wait.

4380
02:45:28,390 --> 02:45:29,370
No, it's the other street.

4381
02:45:29,610 --> 02:45:30,230
Oh, there it is.

4382
02:45:32,010 --> 02:45:33,130
No, that's not Star Kebab.

4383
02:45:33,350 --> 02:45:34,030
Where is Star Kebab?

4384
02:45:34,970 --> 02:45:36,110
Where the hell am I?

4385
02:45:36,650 --> 02:45:38,390
Oh, that's the park.

4386
02:45:38,750 --> 02:45:39,490
It's this way.

4387
02:45:41,130 --> 02:45:42,570
Sorry guys, I'm starting to get sleepy.

4388
02:45:44,910 --> 02:45:45,870
There's Star Kebab.

4389
02:45:48,090 --> 02:45:49,110
There's Star Kebab.

4390
02:45:50,870 --> 02:45:51,390
There's Star Kebab.

4391
02:45:52,550 --> 02:45:55,030
A culture zone is way farther than it looks.

4392
02:45:55,170 --> 02:45:56,530
But you can always see it.

4393
02:45:56,610 --> 02:45:59,990
It looks so far, but it's like a good landmark.

4394
02:46:00,210 --> 02:46:00,810
You know what I mean?

4395
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:03,910
This is where...

4396
02:46:03,910 --> 02:46:05,350
This is another place that I...

4397
02:46:05,350 --> 02:46:06,750
The other Jambara...

4398
02:46:06,750 --> 02:46:08,550
Another retro...

4399
02:46:09,430 --> 02:46:11,130
Retro game place down here.

4400
02:46:11,230 --> 02:46:11,910
In the basement.

4401
02:46:11,910 --> 02:46:13,030
Someone asked.

4402
02:46:13,110 --> 02:46:14,290
Other than like Super Potato.

4403
02:46:15,770 --> 02:46:16,250
Sorry.

4404
02:46:19,250 --> 02:46:20,330
There's here as well.

4405
02:46:22,910 --> 02:46:23,870
Yes, yes, yes.

4406
02:46:29,010 --> 02:46:29,970
Star Kebab.

4407
02:46:29,970 --> 02:46:31,290
But I know this street.

4408
02:46:31,490 --> 02:46:33,390
I know this street the bestest.

4409
02:46:33,410 --> 02:46:36,130
And I'll show you why in like two seconds.

4410
02:46:40,170 --> 02:46:42,330
Because this place I go...

4411
02:46:42,330 --> 02:46:45,070
This street I visit all the time.

4412
02:46:45,470 --> 02:46:48,270
Here is Akihabara Deer Stage.

4413
02:46:50,450 --> 02:46:51,170
Here is Akihabara Deer Stage.

4414
02:46:51,170 --> 02:46:53,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4415
02:46:54,110 --> 02:46:56,610
Did Mint mention Atoreya Akiba Station?

4416
02:46:56,810 --> 02:46:57,570
I did, I did.

4417
02:46:57,990 --> 02:47:00,170
Here is Akihabara Deer Stage.

4418
02:47:00,390 --> 02:47:04,230
My beloved deer stage.

4419
02:47:04,670 --> 02:47:06,110
Here is Akihabara Deer Stage.

4420
02:47:06,110 --> 02:47:06,950
I come to Akihabara.

4421
02:47:07,010 --> 02:47:07,590
I go here.

4422
02:47:07,830 --> 02:47:08,430
Place.

4423
02:47:10,310 --> 02:47:12,410
My lovely deer stage.

4424
02:47:13,330 --> 02:47:14,930
You have Arcana Project.

4425
02:47:16,950 --> 02:47:18,230
You have Aizawarisa.

4426
02:47:19,290 --> 02:47:20,190
You have...

4427
02:47:20,190 --> 02:47:21,250
Oh, Mia Regina.

4428
02:47:21,610 --> 02:47:22,390
Rest in peace.

4429
02:47:22,730 --> 02:47:23,910
Wait, this is from 2022.

4430
02:47:24,350 --> 02:47:25,310
Can I see?

4431
02:47:25,470 --> 02:47:26,710
Is there a more latest one?

4432
02:47:26,930 --> 02:47:27,690
There is not.

4433
02:47:28,170 --> 02:47:28,890
That's okay.

4434
02:47:29,290 --> 02:47:33,490
They always advertise like recent releases for their talent.

4435
02:47:33,490 --> 02:47:35,710
On these little billboards here.

4436
02:47:35,890 --> 02:47:36,990
So if you don't know.

4437
02:47:38,130 --> 02:47:38,710
Deer Stage.

4438
02:47:39,730 --> 02:47:40,810
It is a...

4439
02:47:40,810 --> 02:47:43,410
It is a legendary spot of Akihabara.

4440
02:47:43,950 --> 02:47:44,750
It is...

4441
02:47:44,750 --> 02:47:46,590
Oh yeah, let's go back in time and see.

4442
02:47:46,890 --> 02:47:47,850
Oh my gosh, wait.

4443
02:47:48,010 --> 02:47:50,550
If I go back to like 2016, it will be Dempa, won't it?

4444
02:47:53,650 --> 02:47:54,450
Oh, wait.

4445
02:47:54,550 --> 02:47:55,010
Hold on.

4446
02:47:58,430 --> 02:47:59,410
Wait, I went to March.

4447
02:47:59,530 --> 02:47:59,930
There we go.

4448
02:48:01,610 --> 02:48:02,790
Oh my gosh.

4449
02:48:03,570 --> 02:48:04,890
Oh my gosh.

4450
02:48:06,450 --> 02:48:07,450
Dempa Gumi Inc.

4451
02:48:07,570 --> 02:48:08,190
Welcome to Deer Stage.

4452
02:48:09,630 --> 02:48:11,570
And then this is another Dempa Gumi album.

4453
02:48:11,990 --> 02:48:13,570
And then this is Moso Calibration.

4454
02:48:15,930 --> 02:48:17,230
One Man Live.

4455
02:48:19,030 --> 02:48:20,290
Yeah, oh my gosh.

4456
02:48:21,050 --> 02:48:21,650
Natsukashii.

4457
02:48:23,250 --> 02:48:23,550
Natsukashii.

4458
02:48:25,930 --> 02:48:27,510
It's always been the same.

4459
02:48:29,250 --> 02:48:31,390
Thomas, thanks for the 10 gifted.

4460
02:48:33,490 --> 02:48:34,230
Thank you.

4461
02:48:35,370 --> 02:48:37,430
So I've talked about it before.

4462
02:48:37,670 --> 02:48:39,250
But on the first floor here.

4463
02:48:39,450 --> 02:48:41,570
Is like, there's a big stage right here.

4464
02:48:41,810 --> 02:48:42,750
You can go in.

4465
02:48:43,370 --> 02:48:44,730
If the curtain...

4466
02:48:44,730 --> 02:48:46,290
Sometimes the curtain is closed.

4467
02:48:46,790 --> 02:48:48,230
Just walk right past it.

4468
02:48:48,350 --> 02:48:49,830
You can open up the curtain.

4469
02:48:49,990 --> 02:48:53,690
They just do it for like live performances and stuff like that.

4470
02:48:53,810 --> 02:48:54,770
If there's gonna be a...

4471
02:48:56,070 --> 02:48:57,490
If there's gonna be a live performance.

4472
02:48:58,170 --> 02:48:59,510
You just go on in.

4473
02:49:00,510 --> 02:49:02,810
As long as it's not a ticketed day, of course.

4474
02:49:02,810 --> 02:49:04,490
But they'll stop you of course.

4475
02:49:04,510 --> 02:49:05,370
If it is.

4476
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:08,430
And then this floor is the...

4477
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,210
Cafe.

4478
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:11,750
And then this floor is the bar.

4479
02:49:12,510 --> 02:49:14,410
So the whole building...

4480
02:49:15,270 --> 02:49:16,110
Is Deer Stage.

4481
02:49:16,290 --> 02:49:16,990
Are they open everyday?

4482
02:49:17,250 --> 02:49:17,650
No!

4483
02:49:20,190 --> 02:49:21,210
No, they're not.

4484
02:49:21,650 --> 02:49:23,370
I don't remember what day they're closed though.

4485
02:49:25,130 --> 02:49:26,650
How do you get tickets for Deer Stage?

4486
02:49:27,210 --> 02:49:28,070
That's the cool thing.

4487
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:29,430
Unless it's an event.

4488
02:49:30,230 --> 02:49:32,110
The tickets might be a little more hard to get.

4489
02:49:32,810 --> 02:49:34,910
They're like fan club related and things like that.

4490
02:49:35,030 --> 02:49:36,890
But for normal days...

4491
02:49:36,890 --> 02:49:38,750
You just walk in and you pay.

4492
02:49:38,950 --> 02:49:39,490
And that's it.

4493
02:49:39,630 --> 02:49:40,250
It's super easy.

4494
02:49:41,650 --> 02:49:42,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4495
02:49:43,250 --> 02:49:44,190
I wonder...

4496
02:49:45,030 --> 02:49:45,630
2009...

4497
02:49:45,630 --> 02:49:48,410
Okay, so...

4498
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:49,370
It's hard to tell.

4499
02:49:49,830 --> 02:49:52,870
But this is actually like...

4500
02:49:52,870 --> 02:49:54,450
They lift up.

4501
02:49:54,630 --> 02:49:55,590
Like they're...

4502
02:49:56,690 --> 02:49:58,770
It's like a sliding door basically.

4503
02:49:59,230 --> 02:50:00,150
Oh my gosh!

4504
02:50:00,150 --> 02:50:00,470
Oh my gosh!

4505
02:50:00,790 --> 02:50:02,950
Oh my gosh!

4506
02:50:04,150 --> 02:50:05,250
Is that lettuce?

4507
02:50:05,470 --> 02:50:06,430
Oh my god, stop!

4508
02:50:12,130 --> 02:50:14,190
Are Nora and Petra in this?

4509
02:50:14,290 --> 02:50:15,470
I don't think so.

4510
02:50:15,890 --> 02:50:17,430
Wait, is Amane in this?

4511
02:50:17,510 --> 02:50:18,150
I can't tell.

4512
02:50:18,430 --> 02:50:21,030
There's a meeting up front that looks like...

4513
02:50:21,030 --> 02:50:25,050
Oh my gosh, sorry.

4514
02:50:25,130 --> 02:50:26,250
I'm fangirling a little bit.

4515
02:50:28,130 --> 02:50:29,210
This is... oh wait.

4516
02:50:30,150 --> 02:50:30,870
This would be past...

4517
02:50:31,710 --> 02:50:34,210
This would be past Nora and Petra.

4518
02:50:34,370 --> 02:50:34,810
I'm pretty sure.

4519
02:50:36,050 --> 02:50:37,090
And then...

4520
02:50:37,950 --> 02:50:39,250
Muscle calibration again.

4521
02:50:39,390 --> 02:50:40,190
Rest in peace.

4522
02:50:41,010 --> 02:50:42,810
But yeah, so these lift up actually.

4523
02:50:42,890 --> 02:50:44,070
So you can actually see here.

4524
02:50:44,410 --> 02:50:45,250
Oh my gosh!

4525
02:50:46,810 --> 02:50:47,330
Wow!

4526
02:50:48,990 --> 02:50:50,990
Oh my gosh, they don't lift it anymore.

4527
02:50:51,670 --> 02:50:52,730
Obviously, but...

4528
02:50:52,730 --> 02:50:53,150
Wow!

4529
02:50:54,350 --> 02:50:55,310
Oh my god.

4530
02:50:55,310 --> 02:50:55,630
Oh my god.

4531
02:50:55,650 --> 02:50:57,110
Old... old...

4532
02:50:57,110 --> 02:50:58,290
Dear stage.

4533
02:51:00,490 --> 02:51:01,890
Old Akihabara.

4534
02:51:02,270 --> 02:51:05,410
But it also still kinda looks the same, doesn't it?

4535
02:51:05,530 --> 02:51:06,030
Let's see.

4536
02:51:06,130 --> 02:51:08,330
From 2009 to 2022?

4537
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:12,490
This is just a computer store.

4538
02:51:14,390 --> 02:51:15,550
Instead of...

4539
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:20,710
What was also a computer store.

4540
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:29,360
So, not so much has changed.

4541
02:51:33,420 --> 02:51:34,980
It's gotten a little wider.

4542
02:51:35,740 --> 02:51:37,580
It's a blue computer store instead of red.

4543
02:51:41,300 --> 02:51:46,340
So, you know, it is kind of... it is a little comforting, right?

4544
02:51:46,420 --> 02:51:48,360
Because, you know, so much of Akiba has changed.

4545
02:51:48,660 --> 02:51:50,480
But it is really comforting to know that.

4546
02:51:50,480 --> 02:51:52,620
Also, so much has stayed the same.

4547
02:51:52,820 --> 02:51:54,900
This is Akiba... or Akiba...

4548
02:51:54,900 --> 02:51:57,640
This is Dear Stage's official Vocaloid, even, too.

4549
02:51:57,820 --> 02:52:04,300
Tone Rion, who is drawn by Poyoyon, one of my favorite artists ever.

4550
02:52:04,520 --> 02:52:06,280
Who is also known as Akio Watanabe.

4551
02:52:06,460 --> 02:52:08,860
Also known as the Bakemonogatari artist.

4552
02:52:09,160 --> 02:52:13,200
Who is also voiced by my Kamioshi Yumemi Nemu!

4553
02:52:22,820 --> 02:52:24,780
Yes, he also did the art for Chrisaya!

4554
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:25,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4555
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:25,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4556
02:52:29,260 --> 02:52:30,840
Isn't Nemu also a Vocaloid?

4557
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:32,080
You are right!

4558
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:34,320
She is also her own Vocaloid!

4559
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:37,200
That she also goes by Yumemi Nemu.

4560
02:52:38,320 --> 02:52:39,320
She's very cute.

4561
02:52:40,380 --> 02:52:40,820
Yeah.

4562
02:52:41,260 --> 02:52:44,440
And they built this family mart a couple years ago.

4563
02:52:45,380 --> 02:52:50,320
So, if you are ever at Dear Stage, and you're just like, I'm just here for the live performances.

4564
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:51,940
I don't really want to go to the cafe.

4565
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:54,140
Which, you should go to the cafe.

4566
02:52:54,140 --> 02:52:58,000
But, it's only a thousand yen to see the shows.

4567
02:52:58,100 --> 02:52:59,960
And you get three a night, usually.

4568
02:53:01,260 --> 02:53:02,700
But if you're like, I'm going to go eat.

4569
02:53:02,780 --> 02:53:03,560
You can leave.

4570
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:05,660
And then go to family mart.

4571
02:53:06,020 --> 02:53:06,820
And then go back.

4572
02:53:12,060 --> 02:53:12,460
Yeah.

4573
02:53:17,240 --> 02:53:18,040
What else?

4574
02:53:20,340 --> 02:53:21,020
There's so much.

4575
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:23,640
I'm going to probably rush a little bit more through some of these.

4576
02:53:24,260 --> 02:53:25,200
Because I...

4577
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:27,600
I'm so sleepy.

4578
02:53:28,480 --> 02:53:29,160
Oh, whoa!

4579
02:53:30,200 --> 02:53:31,760
Yeah, this is all built here.

4580
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:35,060
But I don't remember what it is.

4581
02:53:36,640 --> 02:53:38,480
Oh, this ramen place is good.

4582
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:42,280
I'm almost positive I mentioned it before in my previous ones.

4583
02:53:42,360 --> 02:53:43,100
But this is a...

4584
02:53:43,100 --> 02:53:45,300
This is a chicken ramen.

4585
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:47,660
So, their broth is chicken based.

4586
02:53:47,780 --> 02:53:49,900
So, some people can't have pork, right?

4587
02:53:50,740 --> 02:53:53,220
So, if you're ever like, I want...

4588
02:53:53,220 --> 02:53:54,460
Chicken ramen.

4589
02:53:55,380 --> 02:53:56,860
Or I can't have pork.

4590
02:53:57,100 --> 02:54:01,960
Then this place has really, really good chicken broth ramen.

4591
02:54:02,220 --> 02:54:05,760
But also, if you're just like, I'm vegetarian.

4592
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:07,920
I can't have chicken broth either.

4593
02:54:08,180 --> 02:54:10,920
Well, they also have a vegetarian ramen.

4594
02:54:11,380 --> 02:54:12,020
So...

4595
02:54:13,780 --> 02:54:21,420
So, you can also get full vegetarian ramen at this chicken noodle location.

4596
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:25,800
It's good though.

4597
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:28,820
Yeah, it's good, it's good, it's good.

4598
02:54:29,060 --> 02:54:29,620
It's good.

4599
02:54:29,740 --> 02:54:30,440
Oh yeah, here...

4600
02:54:30,960 --> 02:54:33,760
My friends and I lovingly call this the Deer Stage Appa.

4601
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:36,300
Because it's right next to Deer Stage.

4602
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:39,340
We're just like, go to Deer Stage.

4603
02:54:39,660 --> 02:54:40,980
Go to Appa.

4604
02:54:40,980 --> 02:54:41,740
Go back home.

4605
02:54:44,360 --> 02:54:47,420
So, there's one of the other Appas in Akihabara.

4606
02:54:47,900 --> 02:54:49,060
Oh my gosh, I feel like I'm...

4607
02:54:49,060 --> 02:54:50,100
There's another Akibao.

4608
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:52,000
I feel like I'm gonna have to do another part.

4609
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:53,600
I feel like I'm...

4610
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:00,180
Living the life.

4611
02:55:00,720 --> 02:55:01,940
For those...

4612
02:55:01,940 --> 02:55:03,500
Some people mentioned it before.

4613
02:55:04,300 --> 02:55:06,180
Here is your Mandarake.

4614
02:55:07,140 --> 02:55:08,720
This entire building.

4615
02:55:09,060 --> 02:55:09,880
You sell...

4616
02:55:09,880 --> 02:55:13,560
You do the selling stuff here at the bottom.

4617
02:55:13,740 --> 02:55:17,920
And then every floor above is this whole building is Mandarake.

4618
02:55:19,980 --> 02:55:21,500
Not Mandrake.

4619
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:22,600
I mean, yes.

4620
02:55:22,820 --> 02:55:23,380
Mandrake.

4621
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:25,900
A part two would be cool.

4622
02:55:26,820 --> 02:55:30,640
Maybe if I do a part two, I can do some actual footage that I take.

4623
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:31,940
I will...

4624
02:55:32,560 --> 02:55:33,660
Do my best.

4625
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:35,340
I will do my best.

4626
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:39,100
What's your favorite place in the downtown?

4627
02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:41,620
The downtown?

4628
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:45,340
Downtown.

4629
02:55:46,300 --> 02:55:49,180
When you're slow and you wanna go.

4630
02:55:49,340 --> 02:55:50,980
You know you can go.

4631
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:52,620
Downtown.

4632
02:55:54,240 --> 02:55:57,920
I like to go to the parlor show.

4633
02:55:58,040 --> 02:55:59,720
At the deer stage.

4634
02:56:00,700 --> 02:56:01,420
Downtown.

4635
02:56:03,400 --> 02:56:04,120
Yeah.

4636
02:56:05,160 --> 02:56:06,900
Food recommendations too?

4637
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:09,000
I would actually...

4638
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:09,920
Not gonna lie.

4639
02:56:10,100 --> 02:56:11,300
Bashamin has been in the chat.

4640
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:15,380
Bashamin has so many great Akihabara food recommendations.

4641
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:18,060
So, definitely check out her channel.

4642
02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:20,240
For...

4643
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:21,640
For her...

4644
02:56:21,640 --> 02:56:21,980
Her...

4645
02:56:21,980 --> 02:56:24,920
Video tours of Akihabara as well.

4646
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:25,880
And...

4647
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:30,840
I think for me, I probably give more of a perspective from a...

4648
02:56:31,320 --> 02:56:32,580
You know, like a tourist.

4649
02:56:33,580 --> 02:56:34,060
So...

4650
02:56:36,140 --> 02:56:40,740
But she has some really great food recommendations, so...

4651
02:56:40,740 --> 02:56:41,220
Hmm...

4652
02:56:41,220 --> 02:56:42,320
I'm pitching her.

4653
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:44,720
Yeah, yeah.

4654
02:56:45,700 --> 02:56:49,480
She and I have collabed a long time ago in the past, so...

4655
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:51,500
She's always been so cute.

4656
02:56:51,740 --> 02:56:52,300
Basamin!

4657
02:56:52,820 --> 02:56:53,900
Everybody go follow.

4658
02:56:56,040 --> 02:56:57,740
But yeah, here's Mandarake.

4659
02:56:58,180 --> 02:57:00,480
Again, you take the stairs.

4660
02:57:00,680 --> 02:57:02,780
There's also like a teeny tiny elevator here.

4661
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,460
If you don't want to take the stairs like up eight floors.

4662
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:11,300
But the inside is also very tiny and packed so just be mindful.

4663
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:16,260
There's a ramen place here which has really huge ramen.

4664
02:57:16,260 --> 02:57:21,200
And they do sometimes collabs with anime shows as well.

4665
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:24,720
Let's see...

4666
02:57:29,950 --> 02:57:31,340
Hard off here as well.

4667
02:57:32,860 --> 02:57:43,140
I remember this spot very vividly because I was standing like maybe maybe right here or right here.

4668
02:57:43,240 --> 02:57:44,100
Also, I love this.

4669
02:57:48,560 --> 02:57:54,880
I love how they're just like Hey, check out what maids we've got for at home maid cafe.

4670
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:58,300
That's so funny.

4671
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:04,960
Yeah.

4672
02:58:07,220 --> 02:58:08,800
Oh, thank you ghost door.

4673
02:58:08,900 --> 02:58:09,740
Thank you.

4674
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:11,940
Thank you, thank you.

4675
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:15,740
But I was standing right here.

4676
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:25,380
I remember this spot so vividly because because I was waiting on a friend and this guy came up and he tried talking to me in English.

4677
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:27,880
He was just like Are you lost?

4678
02:58:28,420 --> 02:58:29,940
You look so lost.

4679
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:33,040
I was just standing here on my phone like waiting for my friend.

4680
02:58:33,120 --> 02:58:34,840
I was like no I'm not lost.

4681
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:36,080
I'm waiting for a friend.

4682
02:58:36,580 --> 02:58:37,600
They'll be here soon.

4683
02:58:37,940 --> 02:58:38,900
He was just like no.

4684
02:58:39,560 --> 02:58:40,840
You are lost.

4685
02:58:41,140 --> 02:58:42,500
You are looking at your phone.

4686
02:58:42,680 --> 02:58:43,840
You don't know where to go.

4687
02:58:44,220 --> 02:58:44,800
I was like no.

4688
02:58:45,480 --> 02:58:45,960
No.

4689
02:58:46,260 --> 02:58:49,840
I'm just I'm just waiting.

4690
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:51,620
I'm just waiting for my friend.

4691
02:58:51,720 --> 02:58:52,240
They'll be here.

4692
02:58:52,320 --> 02:58:53,700
They're like I don't believe you.

4693
02:58:53,960 --> 02:58:56,080
I don't believe that you're waiting for your friend.

4694
02:58:56,200 --> 02:58:56,660
Here.

4695
02:58:56,800 --> 02:58:57,180
Here.

4696
02:58:57,280 --> 02:58:57,460
Here.

4697
02:58:57,540 --> 02:58:58,340
Come with me.

4698
02:58:58,400 --> 02:58:58,920
Come with me.

4699
02:59:00,580 --> 02:59:03,960
They tried like They tried kidnapping me.

4700
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:08,860
I had to be like I'm waiting for my friend.

4701
02:59:14,260 --> 02:59:14,660
For my friend.

4702
02:59:14,660 --> 02:59:15,960
I had to be so insistent.

4703
02:59:16,020 --> 02:59:17,420
And then I had to be like oh.

4704
02:59:17,820 --> 02:59:21,160
I had to be like my friend is My friend is down here.

4705
02:59:22,560 --> 02:59:24,460
So I just walked.

4706
02:59:25,060 --> 02:59:27,880
I just It was so weird.

4707
02:59:27,960 --> 02:59:29,220
It was such a weird experience.

4708
02:59:29,560 --> 02:59:33,580
I was like why are you Why would you think I'm lost?

4709
02:59:35,320 --> 02:59:36,440
Looking at my phone.

4710
02:59:36,440 --> 02:59:37,740
But then again.

4711
02:59:37,840 --> 02:59:39,300
I've also seen some people.

4712
02:59:39,640 --> 02:59:40,780
In Akiba.

4713
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:41,720
Some foreigners.

4714
02:59:41,800 --> 02:59:44,740
Looking at their phones and I'm like They look lost.

4715
02:59:47,260 --> 02:59:51,440
So maybe Maybe they just had a silly look about me.

4716
02:59:52,860 --> 02:59:54,320
Here is Tsurugaya.

4717
02:59:54,500 --> 02:59:55,660
Another Tsurugaya.

4718
02:59:55,880 --> 02:59:56,800
If you're looking for.

4719
02:59:56,960 --> 02:59:57,320
Oh.

4720
02:59:57,580 --> 02:59:58,140
Kandu.

4721
02:59:58,180 --> 02:59:58,840
Is it still here?

4722
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:01,140
It's Kandu.

4723
03:00:01,760 --> 03:00:03,560
It's another 100 yen store.

4724
03:00:03,900 --> 03:00:05,200
But I prefer 3 coin.

4725
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:06,940
It's part of the Appa.

4726
03:00:08,420 --> 03:00:10,640
You are lost is crazy work.

4727
03:00:10,820 --> 03:00:11,360
Right?

4728
03:00:14,240 --> 03:00:15,480
It's so funny.

4729
03:00:17,140 --> 03:00:18,000
There's so many.

4730
03:00:18,160 --> 03:00:18,920
Look at this.

4731
03:00:19,400 --> 03:00:20,180
Look at this.

4732
03:00:23,360 --> 03:00:24,220
I'll be honest.

4733
03:00:24,300 --> 03:00:25,140
I buy all my stuff.

4734
03:00:26,620 --> 03:00:28,020
From Tsurugaya online.

4735
03:00:28,920 --> 03:00:30,720
It sounded like I just said Gaya online.

4736
03:00:31,120 --> 03:00:32,580
Tsurugaya Online.

4737
03:00:32,900 --> 03:00:36,260
So I don't really visit the stores that much.

4738
03:00:36,940 --> 03:00:37,580
Themselves.

4739
03:00:38,840 --> 03:00:39,480
Yeah.

4740
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:40,580
Uh.

4741
03:00:41,480 --> 03:00:42,120
Wait.

4742
03:00:44,220 --> 03:00:45,100
I was like.

4743
03:00:45,160 --> 03:00:46,160
Is this the kindergarten?

4744
03:00:46,960 --> 03:00:49,920
There's like a random park and kindergarten here.

4745
03:00:50,120 --> 03:00:50,900
It's pretty funny.

4746
03:00:51,220 --> 03:00:52,860
Trying to look for another place.

4747
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:54,240
It's not Bee Cat though.

4748
03:00:55,700 --> 03:01:02,020
Trying to look for the other Annie Song bar that my friend suggested.

4749
03:01:02,500 --> 03:01:02,760
Yeah.

4750
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:05,440
Here's the kindergarten.

4751
03:01:06,440 --> 03:01:08,720
It's kinda cute because around 5pm.

4752
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:10,180
It is 5pm right?

4753
03:01:10,300 --> 03:01:12,220
At 5pm the chimes will go off.

4754
03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:13,420
So um.

4755
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:16,280
You can uh.

4756
03:01:17,140 --> 03:01:18,000
You'll hear that.

4757
03:01:18,620 --> 03:01:19,300
Okay hold on.

4758
03:01:19,380 --> 03:01:19,960
I wanna go back.

4759
03:01:20,140 --> 03:01:20,840
Not quite done.

4760
03:01:21,480 --> 03:01:22,340
Not quite done.

4761
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:22,740
Hold on.

4762
03:01:26,860 --> 03:01:29,940
I asked my normie friends to pick up an animator book from Mandarake.

4763
03:01:30,620 --> 03:01:31,940
While they were in Akiba.

4764
03:01:32,020 --> 03:01:33,920
And they were led to the floor with all the doujins.

4765
03:01:36,660 --> 03:01:37,140
And they were led to the floor with all the doujins.

4766
03:01:37,140 --> 03:01:39,100
I mean there are a lot of floors with doujins.

4767
03:01:39,740 --> 03:01:40,220
I mean there are a lot of floors with doujins.

4768
03:01:41,100 --> 03:01:41,980
Um this is.

4769
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:42,920
I mentioned it earlier.

4770
03:01:43,300 --> 03:01:44,140
Lillian Pleon.

4771
03:01:44,380 --> 03:01:45,760
This is the other location.

4772
03:01:46,140 --> 03:01:48,620
I think it's this floor and this floor.

4773
03:01:49,080 --> 03:01:49,760
I think it's this floor and this floor.

4774
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:50,400
But they're very cute.

4775
03:01:50,620 --> 03:01:53,100
This floor has like the entrance and uh.

4776
03:01:53,380 --> 03:01:54,480
Some other stuff.

4777
03:01:54,720 --> 03:01:55,900
I wish these were open.

4778
03:01:57,580 --> 03:01:58,760
It's so frustrating.

4779
03:01:59,020 --> 03:01:59,820
They're not open.

4780
03:01:59,820 --> 03:02:00,300
Um.

4781
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:04,500
There's a restaurant in here.

4782
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:05,820
Pizza I'm pretty sure.

4783
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:07,520
Um.

4784
03:02:10,260 --> 03:02:10,820
Okay.

4785
03:02:10,880 --> 03:02:11,520
Go back down here.

4786
03:02:12,020 --> 03:02:12,760
Oh wait!

4787
03:02:12,940 --> 03:02:13,320
Ah!

4788
03:02:17,240 --> 03:02:17,800
MADE!

4789
03:02:24,930 --> 03:02:25,490
Spotted.

4790
03:02:25,670 --> 03:02:26,750
Look how cute they are.

4791
03:02:30,370 --> 03:02:31,570
Also in Akiba.

4792
03:02:31,690 --> 03:02:32,510
Please don't take pictures.

4793
03:02:32,530 --> 03:02:33,170
Of the maids.

4794
03:02:33,470 --> 03:02:35,470
Some of them wear signs that like.

4795
03:02:35,970 --> 03:02:37,110
Don't take pictures.

4796
03:02:38,310 --> 03:02:40,210
But you're not supposed to.

4797
03:02:40,890 --> 03:02:41,970
Be respectful.

4798
03:02:42,050 --> 03:02:43,990
Don't be those tourists you know.

4799
03:02:44,530 --> 03:02:45,450
Because now.

4800
03:02:46,050 --> 03:02:46,890
I don't know.

4801
03:02:46,930 --> 03:02:48,350
I'm so worried about some places.

4802
03:02:48,450 --> 03:02:50,250
Because like you heard about.

4803
03:02:50,330 --> 03:02:52,810
How like tourists are banned from certain places.

4804
03:02:53,030 --> 03:02:53,550
In.

4805
03:02:54,670 --> 03:02:56,270
In Kyoto now.

4806
03:02:59,850 --> 03:03:02,070
Because of how they're chasing after them.

4807
03:03:02,530 --> 03:03:04,390
The Michael and everything.

4808
03:03:04,930 --> 03:03:06,070
The geisha yeah.

4809
03:03:06,870 --> 03:03:08,150
Yeah in Gion.

4810
03:03:10,190 --> 03:03:11,490
It's kinda crazy.

4811
03:03:13,010 --> 03:03:14,170
The that.

4812
03:03:14,410 --> 03:03:16,490
The geisha chasers in Gion.

4813
03:03:16,770 --> 03:03:17,530
Yeah.

4814
03:03:18,250 --> 03:03:19,970
They're banned from like certain streets.

4815
03:03:20,630 --> 03:03:21,170
So.

4816
03:03:22,410 --> 03:03:24,410
Just be respectful you know.

4817
03:03:24,690 --> 03:03:25,390
There's one.

4818
03:03:25,510 --> 03:03:27,390
Like one thing to be like.

4819
03:03:27,730 --> 03:03:28,410
Yeah.

4820
03:03:29,570 --> 03:03:30,010
I'm.

4821
03:03:30,830 --> 03:03:31,710

4822
03:03:31,870 --> 03:03:32,410
I'm you know.

4823
03:03:32,450 --> 03:03:32,990
I'm a foreigner.

4824
03:03:33,110 --> 03:03:34,150
I don't really know what I'm doing.

4825
03:03:34,390 --> 03:03:35,290
I'm having fun.

4826
03:03:35,370 --> 03:03:36,570
I'm trying to be respectful you know.

4827
03:03:36,610 --> 03:03:38,510
And there's just being like you know.

4828
03:03:38,670 --> 03:03:39,790
Rowdy rude you know.

4829
03:03:41,130 --> 03:03:41,570
So.

4830
03:03:43,250 --> 03:03:44,130
Down here.

4831
03:03:45,590 --> 03:03:47,070
I like this poster.

4832
03:03:47,190 --> 03:03:48,730
Because Idol Content Expo.

4833
03:03:48,830 --> 03:03:51,490
Is drawn by an idol I really like.

4834
03:03:51,550 --> 03:03:52,770
She's in Dempagumi Inc.

4835
03:03:52,870 --> 03:03:53,950
Her name is Perorin.

4836
03:03:54,830 --> 03:03:56,030
And she drew this.

4837
03:03:56,130 --> 03:03:56,770
She's so cute.

4838
03:03:59,130 --> 03:03:59,650
Okay.

4839
03:03:59,870 --> 03:04:02,650
I think the last time I did my Akiba tour.

4840
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:04,570
We were like Akiba CIA baby.

4841
03:04:04,970 --> 03:04:07,790
We're gonna go to Spy Bar Akiba CIA.

4842
03:04:09,270 --> 03:04:11,050
I regret to inform you.

4843
03:04:11,990 --> 03:04:13,270
That Akiba CIA.

4844
03:04:14,070 --> 03:04:15,310
Is no longer.

4845
03:04:16,890 --> 03:04:17,930
In fact.

4846
03:04:19,590 --> 03:04:20,590
I was gonna say.

4847
03:04:20,630 --> 03:04:22,410
I think it's been replaced by a dog thing.

4848
03:04:22,550 --> 03:04:23,870
But the dog thing is right here.

4849
03:04:24,410 --> 03:04:25,090
But yeah.

4850
03:04:26,090 --> 03:04:27,170
Actually it's um.

4851
03:04:27,390 --> 03:04:27,990
What is it?

4852
03:04:28,410 --> 03:04:31,090
It's another like maid cafe type thing.

4853
03:04:31,210 --> 03:04:32,090
I think it's like some.

4854
03:04:32,250 --> 03:04:34,310
Moon themed maid cafe.

4855
03:04:34,790 --> 03:04:36,250
Or concept cafe.

4856
03:04:36,470 --> 03:04:36,950
Whichever.

4857
03:04:38,350 --> 03:04:40,590
So there is no more Spy Bar.

4858
03:04:40,770 --> 03:04:41,490
Akiba CIA.

4859
03:04:41,990 --> 03:04:44,430
The Akiba Chiyoda Intelligence Agency.

4860
03:04:44,750 --> 03:04:46,530
I never got to go.

4861
03:04:50,920 --> 03:04:53,100
I'll regret it for the rest of my afterlife.

4862
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:55,000
I will.

4863
03:04:55,800 --> 03:04:56,800
I will.

4864
03:04:57,340 --> 03:04:58,860
Now it's Akiba Iris.

4865
03:05:01,280 --> 03:05:02,140
Moon themed?

4866
03:05:02,260 --> 03:05:02,920
What does that mean?

4867
03:05:03,260 --> 03:05:04,100
It's like um.

4868
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:07,920
I think I took a picture of it.

4869
03:05:08,020 --> 03:05:09,460
Let me see if I can find it real quick.

4870
03:05:12,380 --> 03:05:14,820
Cause I remember taking a picture and being like.

4871
03:05:15,020 --> 03:05:15,840
Oh my god no.

4872
03:05:16,580 --> 03:05:17,520
Akiba CIA.

4873
03:05:18,580 --> 03:05:19,440
Akiba CIA.

4874
03:05:20,040 --> 03:05:20,960
Is gone.

4875
03:05:22,340 --> 03:05:23,260
I don't know.

4876
03:05:24,160 --> 03:05:25,840
When I took a picture of it though.

4877
03:05:26,800 --> 03:05:27,160
Any time.

4878
03:05:27,540 --> 03:05:28,620
It could have been.

4879
03:05:35,320 --> 03:05:37,860
It could have been on my old phone even.

4880
03:05:38,060 --> 03:05:38,540
I don't know.

4881
03:05:40,120 --> 03:05:40,840
Hold on.

4882
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,940
I'll do a brief look over.

4883
03:05:50,100 --> 03:05:50,980
Not here.

4884
03:05:51,840 --> 03:05:52,700
Is that it?

4885
03:05:52,880 --> 03:05:54,260
No that's Umumusume.

4886
03:05:56,940 --> 03:05:58,860
I don't want to take too much time though.

4887
03:05:58,860 --> 03:05:59,560
Looking for it.

4888
03:06:04,780 --> 03:06:05,920
That's a Comiket.

4889
03:06:08,740 --> 03:06:09,740
I don't know.

4890
03:06:10,740 --> 03:06:12,780
Let me see if maybe we can time travel too.

4891
03:06:13,280 --> 03:06:13,800
Nope.

4892
03:06:14,400 --> 03:06:17,220
But it's like a different concept cafe now.

4893
03:06:17,360 --> 03:06:18,020
So sad.

4894
03:06:18,860 --> 03:06:19,940
So so sad.

4895
03:06:20,320 --> 03:06:23,160
But what's not sad is if you're looking for.

4896
03:06:23,880 --> 03:06:24,680
Thank you.

4897
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:28,280
I have expected to see you on the street view of Dear Sage.

4898
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:28,980
Why?

4899
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:31,920
I don't just stand out there all the time.

4900
03:06:32,560 --> 03:06:33,040
Thank you.

4901
03:06:34,080 --> 03:06:34,880
Oh wait.

4902
03:06:35,180 --> 03:06:36,520
I think I'm reading the wrong one.

4903
03:06:37,520 --> 03:06:38,320
Thank you.

4904
03:06:38,420 --> 03:06:39,520
Thank you for the tour of Akiba.

4905
03:06:39,620 --> 03:06:42,240
It was so cool seeing all the places.

4906
03:06:42,480 --> 03:06:44,240
I'm planning on visiting sometime next year.

4907
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:45,620
So I'll be sure to check out your recommendations.

4908
03:06:46,060 --> 03:06:46,940
Yeah of course.

4909
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:47,480
Thank you.

4910
03:06:48,900 --> 03:06:50,820
If we didn't want to hear you fangirling.

4911
03:06:50,820 --> 03:06:53,340
We wouldn't tune in to watch you talk about your holy land.

4912
03:06:55,220 --> 03:06:55,660
Yeah.

4913
03:06:56,400 --> 03:06:59,140
So this is actually a theater.

4914
03:06:59,340 --> 03:07:00,120
A live theater.

4915
03:07:00,240 --> 03:07:01,340
So there's twin box garage.

4916
03:07:01,620 --> 03:07:02,880
Which to be honest.

4917
03:07:03,960 --> 03:07:07,280
I've never been to this.

4918
03:07:07,360 --> 03:07:07,660
Oh wait.

4919
03:07:07,720 --> 03:07:08,660
This is now an esports.

4920
03:07:09,340 --> 03:07:10,860
Oh wait they changed it.

4921
03:07:10,940 --> 03:07:12,440
So it's only this theater right in here.

4922
03:07:13,340 --> 03:07:15,940
Oh this used to be a thing up here too.

4923
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:17,360
Okay never mind.

4924
03:07:17,360 --> 03:07:18,720
But yeah.

4925
03:07:18,820 --> 03:07:21,500
Twin box garage is a live house.

4926
03:07:21,580 --> 03:07:25,300
Where you can watch idols.

4927
03:07:25,540 --> 03:07:27,220
And sometimes even.

4928
03:07:28,320 --> 03:07:29,040
Thank you.

4929
03:07:29,700 --> 03:07:31,760
You'll see idols outside the station.

4930
03:07:33,560 --> 03:07:34,720
Outside Akihabara station.

4931
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:36,180
And they'll be passing out flyers.

4932
03:07:36,300 --> 03:07:37,500
And this actually happened to me once.

4933
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:38,880
Where I saw some idols.

4934
03:07:39,020 --> 03:07:40,040
And I was like you know what.

4935
03:07:40,660 --> 03:07:43,560
I'm never seen them before.

4936
03:07:43,640 --> 03:07:45,560
I'm going to go out of my comfort zone a little bit.

4937
03:07:45,920 --> 03:07:46,700
And so.

4938
03:07:47,360 --> 03:07:48,160
I um.

4939
03:07:49,580 --> 03:07:51,520
I asked them like who they were.

4940
03:07:51,800 --> 03:07:52,780
And they told me who they were.

4941
03:07:52,840 --> 03:07:54,320
And they were like yeah actually once.

4942
03:07:55,200 --> 03:07:57,000
Once a month we do a free show.

4943
03:07:57,100 --> 03:07:58,460
At akiba twin box.

4944
03:07:58,720 --> 03:07:59,780
And we're doing one tonight.

4945
03:08:00,020 --> 03:08:02,860
So if you come you can see our free show.

4946
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,140
And I was like what that's so awesome.

4947
03:08:05,900 --> 03:08:07,160
Is there a show every night.

4948
03:08:07,260 --> 03:08:08,340
Not every night no.

4949
03:08:08,480 --> 03:08:10,860
It's not like a dedicated place like deer stage.

4950
03:08:11,260 --> 03:08:12,100
It's more like.

4951
03:08:13,220 --> 03:08:15,120
Specific events like you know.

4952
03:08:15,500 --> 03:08:16,400
Sometimes there's like.

4953
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:19,080
Idol shows though.

4954
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:20,440
Where it's like a bunch of idol groups.

4955
03:08:20,580 --> 03:08:22,760
It's called a taiban for those shows.

4956
03:08:23,140 --> 03:08:24,520
Where like you know.

4957
03:08:24,560 --> 03:08:26,620
15 groups will be performing but.

4958
03:08:27,860 --> 03:08:29,260
But yeah I went.

4959
03:08:29,940 --> 03:08:30,740
I went.

4960
03:08:30,840 --> 03:08:31,880
And I saw them.

4961
03:08:33,100 --> 03:08:34,740
And I was there with like.

4962
03:08:34,880 --> 03:08:35,760
5 other people.

4963
03:08:37,220 --> 03:08:38,760
And everyone was staring.

4964
03:08:38,900 --> 03:08:39,880
At the ghost girl.

4965
03:08:40,320 --> 03:08:42,720
Who clearly was out of place.

4966
03:08:43,160 --> 03:08:43,920
But um.

4967
03:08:43,920 --> 03:08:44,880
It was fun.

4968
03:08:44,920 --> 03:08:45,620
It was a lot of fun.

4969
03:08:46,120 --> 03:08:46,600
So.

4970
03:08:47,960 --> 03:08:49,440
Hello welcome to the membership.

4971
03:08:49,560 --> 03:08:49,880
Thank you.

4972
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:52,640
I found a bunch of great idol groups doing that too.

4973
03:08:52,800 --> 03:08:54,720
Yeah so if you ever want to experience.

4974
03:08:54,980 --> 03:08:57,580
Like a true akiba idol show.

4975
03:08:58,160 --> 03:09:00,960
Twin box is a super awesome place to go to.

4976
03:09:01,860 --> 03:09:03,640
There's also over here akiba oh.

4977
03:09:04,080 --> 03:09:04,900
Another one.

4978
03:09:05,160 --> 03:09:06,260
Oh woah woah woah.

4979
03:09:06,620 --> 03:09:08,340
But I'm also going to introduce.

4980
03:09:09,980 --> 03:09:10,460
Uh.

4981
03:09:11,480 --> 03:09:13,660
One of my favorite maid cafes.

4982
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:16,480
In Akihabara.

4983
03:09:17,640 --> 03:09:18,300
Right here.

4984
03:09:19,280 --> 03:09:20,160
Jam Akihabara.

4985
03:09:20,260 --> 03:09:21,300
So when you see the akiba oh.

4986
03:09:21,520 --> 03:09:22,660

I'm going mad that's for sure.

5003
03:09:57,740 --> 03:10:00,360
Where it's not like you're super high energy.

5004
03:10:00,500 --> 03:10:01,420
Like woohoo.

5005
03:10:01,500 --> 03:10:02,460
This is a maid cafe.

5006
03:10:03,860 --> 03:10:05,580
It's very like chill.

5007
03:10:05,700 --> 03:10:07,300
The girls are like.

03:10:07,540 --> 03:10:10,080
They kind of give you your food.

Lots of people come here to like.

5011
03:10:12,440 --> 03:10:14,960
With their computers to like work on stuff.

5012
03:10:15,120 --> 03:10:15,900
It just feels like.

5013
03:10:16,060 --> 03:10:18,420
It's a cafe with maids essentially.

5014
03:10:19,020 --> 03:10:20,020
And so um.

5015
03:10:20,280 --> 03:10:22,680
They do also a lot of collabs with like.

5016
03:10:23,420 --> 03:10:24,900
With visual novels.

5017
03:10:25,200 --> 03:10:27,120
They've done collabs with vtubers.

5018
03:10:27,700 --> 03:10:29,560
So sometimes they have special menus.

5019
03:10:29,740 --> 03:10:31,160
They have special menus where it's like.

5020
03:10:31,280 --> 03:10:33,520
Specially made cocktails by the maids.

5021
03:10:33,880 --> 03:10:34,360
Um.

5022
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:36,420
They have seasonal stuff.

5023
03:10:36,420 --> 03:10:37,960
Like they just have a lot.

5024
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:39,880
And it's so chill.

5025
03:10:40,140 --> 03:10:42,380
It's like the perfect place to just kind of.

5026
03:10:42,940 --> 03:10:44,380
Go and wind down.

5027
03:10:44,560 --> 03:10:45,580
So after a busy day.

5028
03:10:45,660 --> 03:10:47,540
I'm almost always at Jam Akihabara.

5029
03:10:47,980 --> 03:10:49,280
If I'm not at Deer Stage.

5030
03:10:49,740 --> 03:10:50,460
So um.

5031
03:10:50,820 --> 03:10:53,440
A normal cafe but you get to see maids walking around.

5032
03:10:53,620 --> 03:10:53,940
Exactly.

5033
03:10:54,240 --> 03:10:55,680
What's the name of the cafe again?

5034
03:10:55,880 --> 03:10:57,080
Jam Akihabara.

5035
03:10:57,240 --> 03:10:57,740
Right here.

5036
03:10:57,840 --> 03:10:58,580
You can see it.

5037
03:10:59,700 --> 03:11:00,660

03:11:02,920 --> 03:11:04,140
It's super duper nice.

5041
03:11:04,380 --> 03:11:06,280
Like if you're not wanting the like.

5042
03:11:10,340 --> 03:11:11,780
Everything like that.

5043
03:11:14,540 --> 03:11:16,020
Everything it's just like.

03:11:16,120 --> 03:11:16,960
It's so chill.

5045
03:11:17,100 --> 03:11:18,020
It's so nice.

5049
03:11:22,340 --> 03:11:22,880
Oh!

5050
03:11:22,880 --> 03:11:23,420
Akikaru.

5051
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:26,140
Akikaru is a um.

5052
03:11:27,580 --> 03:11:28,280
It looks.

5053
03:11:28,360 --> 03:11:28,960
Is this?

5054
03:11:30,660 --> 03:11:31,080
Thank you.

5055
03:11:37,450 --> 03:11:38,870
Akikaru is a um.

5056
03:11:39,790 --> 03:11:41,250
Is a um.

5057
03:11:42,950 --> 03:11:44,110
Is a.

5058
03:11:45,620 --> 03:11:45,910
Magazine.

5059
03:11:46,390 --> 03:11:47,410
It's a free magazine.

5060
03:11:47,830 --> 03:11:49,290
Oh it's redo of healer.

5061
03:11:49,330 --> 03:11:50,090
Oh my god that's so funny.

5062
03:11:51,690 --> 03:11:53,050
Oh yeah you're right.

5063
03:11:53,450 --> 03:11:53,970
Um.

5064
03:11:54,770 --> 03:11:55,850
I love Jam.

5065
03:11:56,110 --> 03:11:56,870
Me too.

5066
03:11:59,430 --> 03:12:00,390
Me too.

5067
03:12:01,170 --> 03:12:03,230
But Akikaru is a free magazine.

5068
03:12:03,250 --> 03:12:04,470
That you'll see across.

5069
03:12:05,870 --> 03:12:07,630
In certain places in Akihabara.

5070
03:12:07,810 --> 03:12:08,650
Where um.

5071
03:12:09,050 --> 03:12:09,850
They show.

5072
03:12:10,930 --> 03:12:13,630
It's just like an Akiba themed magazine.

5073
03:12:14,030 --> 03:12:14,430
They're free.

5074
03:12:14,550 --> 03:12:15,710
You can take them for free.

5075
03:12:16,090 --> 03:12:17,490
They have like.

5076
03:12:17,930 --> 03:12:20,050
Akikaru models and stuff.

5077
03:12:20,210 --> 03:12:21,010
And sometimes they do.

5078
03:12:21,790 --> 03:12:23,370
They do interviews with them.

5079
03:12:23,450 --> 03:12:25,010
Or they show off new anime.

5080
03:12:25,150 --> 03:12:26,530
Or new places in Akiba.

5081
03:12:26,870 --> 03:12:27,770
So um.

5082
03:12:27,970 --> 03:12:28,410
Yeah.

5083
03:12:28,410 --> 03:12:28,510
Yeah.

5084
03:12:30,390 --> 03:12:30,790
Uh.

5085
03:12:33,490 --> 03:12:34,310
That's not redo.

5086
03:12:34,870 --> 03:12:37,310
That's the animal slave girl one.

5087
03:12:37,470 --> 03:12:37,850
Oh it's not.

5088
03:12:39,450 --> 03:12:40,150
Oh wait.

5089
03:12:40,290 --> 03:12:40,610
I thought.

5090
03:12:40,730 --> 03:12:40,910
Okay.

5091
03:12:41,550 --> 03:12:42,890
It's so hard to read backwards.

5092
03:12:43,110 --> 03:12:44,410
I thought it said healer.

5093
03:12:44,570 --> 03:12:49,210
I have no idea.

5094
03:12:49,390 --> 03:12:50,250
I have no idea.

5095
03:12:50,370 --> 03:12:51,730
I'm trusting whatever you guys say.

5096
03:12:58,410 --> 03:12:58,650
Hmm.

5097
03:12:59,550 --> 03:13:00,710
I don't know this one.

5098
03:13:00,990 --> 03:13:02,490
I don't know if it's even still there.

5099
03:13:03,330 --> 03:13:05,570
Maid cafes sometimes come and go so quickly.

5100
03:13:08,290 --> 03:13:09,310
Which is a little sad.

5101
03:13:09,470 --> 03:13:11,130
Because if you find one that you really like.

5102
03:13:11,310 --> 03:13:12,930
But Jam has been there forever.

5103
03:13:13,570 --> 03:13:15,030
Like a really long time.

5104
03:13:15,570 --> 03:13:16,930
Really really long time.

5105
03:13:22,570 --> 03:13:23,010
Here's uh.

5106
03:13:23,270 --> 03:13:24,910
So if you're confused where we are.

5107
03:13:24,910 --> 03:13:25,690
Here's Culture Zone.

5108
03:13:26,390 --> 03:13:28,570
This is the big big building.

5109
03:13:28,850 --> 03:13:30,270
There's Taito over there.

5110
03:13:30,550 --> 03:13:31,250
Meat mop.

5111
03:13:32,450 --> 03:13:33,150
And uh.

5112
03:13:34,110 --> 03:13:34,950
This is uh.

5113
03:13:35,270 --> 03:13:35,850
The Lost.

5114
03:13:35,970 --> 03:13:37,890
The used to be Dragon Quest Lost.

5115
03:13:37,970 --> 03:13:40,210
And this is a maid cafe building.

5116
03:13:41,210 --> 03:13:41,730
Um.

5117
03:13:42,150 --> 03:13:42,670
Mmm.

5118
03:13:44,290 --> 03:13:45,030
Meat mop.

5119
03:13:46,710 --> 03:13:49,470
There's always girls here advertising this place.

5120
03:13:49,530 --> 03:13:50,330
But I've never been.

5121
03:13:51,610 --> 03:13:52,650
It says it's a.

5122
03:13:53,210 --> 03:13:54,630
Maid cafe con cafe.

5123
03:13:55,530 --> 03:13:56,610
And it says for.

5124
03:13:57,350 --> 03:13:58,390
13 hours.

5125
03:13:58,450 --> 03:13:59,810
It's 2,000 yen.

5126
03:14:00,870 --> 03:14:02,750
Which is all you can drink.

5127
03:14:03,110 --> 03:14:03,970
Which I'm like.

5128
03:14:05,570 --> 03:14:06,090
Huh?

5129
03:14:11,640 --> 03:14:12,160
Huh?

5130
03:14:18,600 --> 03:14:19,120
Huh?

5131
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:19,340
Huh?

5132
03:14:22,460 --> 03:14:23,660
But there's always girls.

5133
03:14:23,880 --> 03:14:25,020
Advertising it right here.

5134
03:14:25,140 --> 03:14:27,260
They're always standing here with a big sign and stuff.

5135
03:14:28,300 --> 03:14:29,340
Another Akibao.

5136
03:14:30,660 --> 03:14:31,180
Welcome.

5137
03:14:31,320 --> 03:14:32,300
Many thanks.

5138
03:14:36,850 --> 03:14:37,470
Let's see.

5139
03:14:38,870 --> 03:14:39,550
So if you're.

5140
03:14:39,590 --> 03:14:40,970
Again if you're all turned around.

5141
03:14:41,670 --> 03:14:42,970
If you go down this way.

5142
03:14:43,370 --> 03:14:44,910
You'll get to UDX.

5143
03:14:45,050 --> 03:14:46,870
And you'll get to um.

5144
03:14:47,590 --> 03:14:48,830
The train station.

5145
03:14:49,210 --> 03:14:50,570
If you go down this way.

5146
03:14:50,650 --> 03:14:51,810
Which we are going to go down.

5147
03:14:51,930 --> 03:14:53,630
You'll get to Akibao Zettai Ryouiki.

5148
03:15:00,190 --> 03:15:02,110
I mean you can drink water.

5149
03:15:04,690 --> 03:15:05,570
So true.

5150
03:15:05,950 --> 03:15:07,790
The Nomihodai is the water.

5151
03:15:10,830 --> 03:15:12,710
There's some other maid cafes in here.

5152
03:15:13,610 --> 03:15:14,130
Wait.

5153
03:15:15,690 --> 03:15:16,210
Wait.

5154
03:15:16,450 --> 03:15:17,310
In here too?

5155
03:15:17,770 --> 03:15:18,970
Oh no here here sorry.

5156
03:15:19,990 --> 03:15:21,930
There's some other maid cafes in here.

5157
03:15:21,970 --> 03:15:22,330
In here.

5158
03:15:24,070 --> 03:15:24,890
There's like a.

5159
03:15:26,130 --> 03:15:27,790
I think this is the Danso.

5160
03:15:28,050 --> 03:15:28,930
Not Danso.

5161
03:15:28,930 --> 03:15:29,530
I think this is.

5162
03:15:29,650 --> 03:15:30,750
It might be Danso.

5163
03:15:30,890 --> 03:15:32,430
It might be Danso or Ikemen.

5164
03:15:32,670 --> 03:15:33,310
I can't remember.

5165
03:15:34,330 --> 03:15:37,030
But there's an OL cafe down here as well.

5166
03:15:37,330 --> 03:15:38,610
So this is kind of like the.

5167
03:15:38,730 --> 03:15:40,670
Off the beaten path a little bit.

5168
03:15:41,090 --> 03:15:42,090
Can I go please?

5169
03:15:42,370 --> 03:15:43,110
There we go.

5170
03:15:45,910 --> 03:15:47,270
The back roads.

5171
03:15:49,270 --> 03:15:50,210
I'm so impressed.

5172
03:15:50,310 --> 03:15:51,730
By how much you know about Akibao.

5173
03:15:51,750 --> 03:15:52,150
So cute.

5174
03:15:52,570 --> 03:15:54,930
Stop it Maya stop it.

5175
03:15:56,910 --> 03:15:58,430
There's several places back here.

5176
03:15:58,510 --> 03:15:59,510
That I want to mention though.

5177
03:15:59,610 --> 03:16:01,310
Because they're really cool.

5178
03:16:02,150 --> 03:16:02,590
IMHO.

5179
03:16:03,050 --> 03:16:04,170
Why is everything closed?

5180
03:16:04,330 --> 03:16:05,190
I can't tell where the.

5181
03:16:06,770 --> 03:16:08,850
Everything is blocked by the cars.

5182
03:16:09,010 --> 03:16:10,290
I can't tell where anything is.

5183
03:16:13,110 --> 03:16:14,710
I can't tell you guys.

5184
03:16:14,770 --> 03:16:16,370
Where the OL cafe is.

5185
03:16:22,680 --> 03:16:24,340
I think it's somewhere back there.

5186
03:16:24,340 --> 03:16:26,240
I think I passed it but I couldn't see it.

5187
03:16:26,260 --> 03:16:27,040
Oh time travel.

5188
03:16:27,140 --> 03:16:28,100
Yeah we will in a second.

5189
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:30,340
But before we time travel.

5190
03:16:30,480 --> 03:16:32,420
I kind of mentioned cat cafes before.

5191
03:16:32,680 --> 03:16:34,600
This one I like this cat cafe.

5192
03:16:34,880 --> 03:16:36,420
It's called Nekojalala.

5193
03:16:38,940 --> 03:16:40,080
It's pretty small.

5194
03:16:40,840 --> 03:16:42,060
But it's very cute.

5195
03:16:42,260 --> 03:16:43,060
The cats are.

5196
03:16:44,220 --> 03:16:44,840
I don't know.

5197
03:16:44,860 --> 03:16:48,100
I find it better than the really big open cat cafes.

5198
03:16:48,360 --> 03:16:48,760
Because.

5199
03:16:49,720 --> 03:16:51,440
Obviously you get more people in there.

5200
03:16:51,580 --> 03:16:53,540
So the cats are a little more tired.

5201
03:16:54,340 --> 03:16:54,960
Than cat cafes.

5202
03:16:55,360 --> 03:16:58,260
And also because they are bigger.

5203
03:16:58,460 --> 03:17:00,740
There is less chance of seeing a cat.

5204
03:17:01,060 --> 03:17:03,240
But here the cats are like everywhere.

5205
03:17:03,540 --> 03:17:05,260
They are like all over the place.

5206
03:17:05,400 --> 03:17:05,920
They are up.

5207
03:17:05,960 --> 03:17:06,420
They are down.

5208
03:17:06,520 --> 03:17:07,460
They are everywhere.

5209
03:17:08,680 --> 03:17:10,940
I recommend Nekojalala.

5210
03:17:11,620 --> 03:17:13,560
If you want to go to a cat cafe.

5211
03:17:13,960 --> 03:17:15,040
In Akihabara.

5212
03:17:15,560 --> 03:17:18,900
I have not heard anything bad about them.

5213
03:17:19,020 --> 03:17:20,620
So I hope.

5214
03:17:21,100 --> 03:17:22,460
I hope it's okay.

5215
03:17:23,640 --> 03:17:24,320
And so.

5216
03:17:24,340 --> 03:17:25,280
Sometimes when you are walking by.

5217
03:17:25,380 --> 03:17:27,620
You can see a cat in the window as well.

5218
03:17:27,800 --> 03:17:28,860
But it has a sign here.

5219
03:17:28,960 --> 03:17:30,980
It says don't tap on the glass.

5220
03:17:32,020 --> 03:17:33,300
Don't hurt the cats.

5221
03:17:43,790 --> 03:17:44,710
Continuing onward.

5222
03:17:50,490 --> 03:17:51,770
More concept cafe.

5223
03:17:52,030 --> 03:17:52,610
Maid cafe.

5224
03:17:53,010 --> 03:17:53,470
Perhaps.

5225
03:17:55,310 --> 03:17:56,090
I'm really.

5226
03:17:56,930 --> 03:17:57,610
Okay guys.

5227
03:17:58,010 --> 03:17:59,910
We will travel back in time.

5228
03:17:59,970 --> 03:18:02,010
To see if we can find the OL cafe too.

5229
03:18:02,010 --> 03:18:03,770
Sorry I forgot about it a little bit.

5230
03:18:03,830 --> 03:18:05,710
Because I got distracted by this.

5231
03:18:07,010 --> 03:18:07,610
Ta-da.

5232
03:18:09,010 --> 03:18:09,590
Hold on.

5233
03:18:09,950 --> 03:18:11,570
You can see the posters from here.

5234
03:18:12,790 --> 03:18:13,430
Ta-da.

5235
03:18:14,770 --> 03:18:16,390
This is a place called.

5236
03:18:16,730 --> 03:18:17,170
Mylish.

5237
03:18:17,270 --> 03:18:18,190
Which is another maid cafe.

5238
03:18:18,390 --> 03:18:19,810
Sorry I only know maid cafes.

5239
03:18:21,490 --> 03:18:23,410
But Mylish is special because.

5240
03:18:24,170 --> 03:18:25,470
This is the maid cafe.

5241
03:18:25,790 --> 03:18:27,210
Featured in Steins Gate.

5242
03:18:29,310 --> 03:18:29,750
Yeah.

5243
03:18:30,190 --> 03:18:30,630
Yeah.

5244
03:18:30,650 --> 03:18:30,890
Yeah.

5245
03:18:30,890 --> 03:18:31,030
Yeah.

5246
03:18:32,010 --> 03:18:32,110
This is the.

5247
03:18:32,610 --> 03:18:34,390
This is the Steins Gate cafe.

5248
03:18:34,910 --> 03:18:37,430
Actually I think it's this seat.

5249
03:18:37,730 --> 03:18:39,630
Or this seat right here.

5250
03:18:39,750 --> 03:18:40,450
Is where.

5251
03:18:41,590 --> 03:18:42,830
Where they sat.

5252
03:18:43,210 --> 03:18:44,770
In the show.

5253
03:18:45,010 --> 03:18:48,010
And there's even pictures of them sitting in those seats.

5254
03:18:48,010 --> 03:18:48,830
At the tables.

5255
03:18:48,970 --> 03:18:49,730
It's so so cute.

5256
03:18:50,470 --> 03:18:51,030
Yeah.

5257
03:18:53,690 --> 03:18:55,050
It's one of these.

5258
03:18:55,310 --> 03:18:56,430
It's one of these seats.

5259
03:18:58,150 --> 03:18:58,710
Yeah.

5260
03:18:58,990 --> 03:19:00,170
You can go here.

5261
03:19:02,010 --> 03:19:02,890
It's again.

5262
03:19:02,990 --> 03:19:05,730
It's a little more maid cafe than.

5263
03:19:06,470 --> 03:19:07,590
It's like in the middle.

5264
03:19:07,690 --> 03:19:09,610
Between like cure and jam.

5265
03:19:09,950 --> 03:19:12,190
And like maid dreaming and at home.

5266
03:19:12,350 --> 03:19:13,890
It's like just in that middle.

5267
03:19:13,970 --> 03:19:15,970
Where they still do a little bit of.

5268
03:19:16,290 --> 03:19:18,590
Like maid cafe fan service.

5269
03:19:18,650 --> 03:19:19,070
But they.

5270
03:19:19,530 --> 03:19:20,870
Don't perform here.

5271
03:19:21,290 --> 03:19:21,810
Um.

5272
03:19:23,350 --> 03:19:25,130
It's like a little chill.

5273
03:19:26,190 --> 03:19:27,690
But of course you have to go.

5274
03:19:27,790 --> 03:19:29,470
If you're a fan of Steins Gate.

5275
03:19:29,470 --> 03:19:31,970
They have like Steins Gate gachapon in there.

5276
03:19:32,330 --> 03:19:34,450
And this is such a good beginner's maid cafe.

5277
03:19:34,710 --> 03:19:35,110
Yeah.

5278
03:19:35,170 --> 03:19:35,850
That is a.

5279
03:19:35,910 --> 03:19:37,070
That is a good way to put it.

5280
03:19:37,350 --> 03:19:38,910
Have you been to Akiba Guild at all?

5281
03:19:39,010 --> 03:19:40,290
I have not.

5282
03:19:40,510 --> 03:19:43,070
Because to be honest I don't care so much about.

5283
03:19:43,270 --> 03:19:43,930
I mean.

5284
03:19:44,610 --> 03:19:47,050
I was worried that it was more bar than cafe.

5285
03:19:47,270 --> 03:19:47,530
You know.

5286
03:19:48,130 --> 03:19:48,930
Because I was like.

5287
03:19:48,990 --> 03:19:51,170
There's like the whole casino aspect and everything.

5288
03:19:53,290 --> 03:19:55,070
My buddy from KFP went there.

5289
03:19:55,070 --> 03:19:55,550
Oh nice.

5290
03:19:56,690 --> 03:19:57,910
What do you mean beginner?

5291
03:19:58,890 --> 03:19:59,330
Um.

5292
03:20:01,150 --> 03:20:02,650
Beginner in that like.

5293
03:20:04,010 --> 03:20:04,970
A maid cafe.

5294
03:20:05,150 --> 03:20:06,410
Like maid dreaming.

5295
03:20:07,190 --> 03:20:08,170
Or at home.

5296
03:20:09,470 --> 03:20:10,770
Or some of the other ones.

5297
03:20:10,830 --> 03:20:12,070
Might be a little overwhelming.

5298
03:20:12,110 --> 03:20:14,630
In terms of how the energy is.

5299
03:20:14,930 --> 03:20:16,390
But this one is a little more chill.

5300
03:20:16,470 --> 03:20:17,150
If you want to see.

5301
03:20:17,250 --> 03:20:19,650
If you just kind of enjoy the maid cafe vibe.

5302
03:20:19,890 --> 03:20:20,190
You know.

5303
03:20:23,470 --> 03:20:25,550
It's not too weird or overwhelming.

5304
03:20:25,790 --> 03:20:26,010
Yeah.

5305
03:20:26,010 --> 03:20:26,710
Yeah exactly.

5306
03:20:27,070 --> 03:20:27,810
It's pretty chill.

5307
03:20:28,750 --> 03:20:30,330
I'll be cringe and go as Okabe.

5308
03:20:30,490 --> 03:20:30,970
And cosplay.

5309
03:20:31,170 --> 03:20:32,570
It's not cringe at all.

5310
03:20:33,170 --> 03:20:35,150
In fact I'm sure people have done it before.

5311
03:20:37,430 --> 03:20:37,910
Yeah.

5312
03:20:43,430 --> 03:20:44,750
I started with maid dreaming.

5313
03:20:44,930 --> 03:20:45,590
That's okay too.

5314
03:20:47,590 --> 03:20:48,450
It's not bad.

5315
03:20:51,490 --> 03:20:51,970
Um.

5316
03:20:52,150 --> 03:20:53,170
It's not bad at all.

5317
03:20:53,190 --> 03:20:55,050
To start with maid dreaming.

5318
03:20:55,790 --> 03:20:56,890
But if you're looking.

5319
03:20:56,970 --> 03:20:59,810
If you're just like trying to ease someone into the maid cafe world.

5320
03:21:00,350 --> 03:21:01,010
You know.

5321
03:21:01,050 --> 03:21:02,190
This is a good one probably.

5322
03:21:03,070 --> 03:21:03,510
Um.

5323
03:21:04,150 --> 03:21:05,670
Is there a metal gear maid cafe?

5324
03:21:05,970 --> 03:21:08,530
Did you know there was a metal gear cafe in France?

5325
03:21:11,350 --> 03:21:12,310
Did you know?

5326
03:21:12,350 --> 03:21:13,350
That that existed?

5327
03:21:14,490 --> 03:21:15,290
In France?

5328
03:21:15,730 --> 03:21:16,170
Why?

5329
03:21:19,490 --> 03:21:20,870
It was like a pop up cafe.

5330
03:21:21,570 --> 03:21:22,750
I'm pretty sure it was France.

5331
03:21:27,350 --> 03:21:27,830
Yeah.

5332
03:21:27,930 --> 03:21:28,270
Yeah.

5333
03:21:28,270 --> 03:21:29,910
I think it was for MGS4.

5334
03:21:30,170 --> 03:21:30,410
No.

5335
03:21:30,490 --> 03:21:31,250
4 or 5.

5336
03:21:32,390 --> 03:21:32,870
Yeah.

5337
03:21:34,730 --> 03:21:36,570
It was somewhere in Europe.

5338
03:21:37,030 --> 03:21:38,550
It might have not been France but.

5339
03:21:38,830 --> 03:21:39,310
Yeah.

5340
03:21:39,830 --> 03:21:41,030
It was a special event.

5341
03:21:43,450 --> 03:21:44,810
No it's not there anymore.

5342
03:21:44,950 --> 03:21:45,650
It was just a pop up.

5343
03:21:46,590 --> 03:21:47,430
I'm so depressed.

5344
03:21:48,330 --> 03:21:50,330
But also I would have had to go to France.

5345
03:21:50,330 --> 03:21:50,870
Hahaha.

5346
03:21:53,650 --> 03:21:54,170
Um.

5347
03:21:54,290 --> 03:21:55,930
This place right next to it also.

5348
03:21:56,350 --> 03:21:58,090
Right next to Mileage is called.

5349
03:21:58,230 --> 03:21:59,450
It is still here right?

5350
03:22:00,510 --> 03:22:01,030
Uh.

5351
03:22:01,950 --> 03:22:03,510
It might be here.

5352
03:22:05,250 --> 03:22:06,990
Or it might be down here.

5353
03:22:07,250 --> 03:22:08,690
Thank you.

5354
03:22:09,570 --> 03:22:10,390
Thank you.

5355
03:22:10,610 --> 03:22:10,870
Thank you.

5356
03:22:12,650 --> 03:22:14,250
I like how when you're the tour guide.

5357
03:22:14,370 --> 03:22:16,150
Akiba appears to be oops all maids.

5358
03:22:16,190 --> 03:22:16,590
Hahaha.

5359
03:22:16,590 --> 03:22:17,210
Hey.

5360
03:22:17,470 --> 03:22:18,090
Can you.

5361
03:22:19,130 --> 03:22:21,270
I've talked about figure stores too.

5362
03:22:21,590 --> 03:22:22,430
I talked about.

5363
03:22:22,510 --> 03:22:24,490
I talked about those annoying clappers at.

5364
03:22:24,810 --> 03:22:25,370
Taito.

5365
03:22:27,010 --> 03:22:27,810
Genie store.

5366
03:22:28,010 --> 03:22:29,370
Thank you.

5367
03:22:30,230 --> 03:22:30,950
Thank you.

5368
03:22:32,050 --> 03:22:32,610
Um.

5369
03:22:34,490 --> 03:22:37,350
Made Dreaming and Anil has English menu software on their stuff.

5370
03:22:37,430 --> 03:22:37,870
Oh yes.

5371
03:22:38,190 --> 03:22:41,770
Made Dreaming and At Home also are very foreigner friendly.

5372
03:22:41,910 --> 03:22:43,810
Because they're like the two biggest in Akiba.

5373
03:22:43,810 --> 03:22:45,910
So they have a lot of good.

5374
03:22:46,090 --> 03:22:47,370
They have a lot of um.

5375
03:22:47,510 --> 03:22:49,050
Not only just usually maids.

5376
03:22:49,170 --> 03:22:50,890
At least some maids that speak a little bit of English.

5377
03:22:51,170 --> 03:22:51,610
Um.

5378
03:22:51,710 --> 03:22:53,550
But they also have English menu.

5379
03:22:53,770 --> 03:22:54,090
So.

5380
03:22:54,970 --> 03:22:55,850
But anyway.

5381
03:22:56,070 --> 03:22:56,990
This place is called.

5382
03:22:57,250 --> 03:22:57,690
Um.

5383
03:22:58,850 --> 03:23:00,370
And it says menu list.

5384
03:23:00,550 --> 03:23:02,710
But it's not the type of menu that you'd expect.

5385
03:23:02,970 --> 03:23:03,650
It's not a restaurant.

5386
03:23:03,890 --> 03:23:05,970
This is actually a hair salon.

5387
03:23:07,270 --> 03:23:08,350
Which is so cool.

5388
03:23:08,710 --> 03:23:11,590
It's a otaku themed hair salon.

5389
03:23:11,810 --> 03:23:12,650
Where if you're just like.

5390
03:23:13,810 --> 03:23:14,350
A hair cut like.

5391
03:23:15,810 --> 03:23:16,610
I don't know.

5392
03:23:16,670 --> 03:23:17,210
Kirito.

5393
03:23:18,090 --> 03:23:22,030
You can go and request your hair to be cut like.

5394
03:23:22,550 --> 03:23:23,730
An anime character.

5395
03:23:23,890 --> 03:23:25,650
You can tell them an anime character.

5396
03:23:25,870 --> 03:23:26,950
And be like I want.

5397
03:23:28,270 --> 03:23:29,470
I want Rem.

5398
03:23:29,730 --> 03:23:31,070
Blue hair color.

5399
03:23:31,350 --> 03:23:32,510
And they'll make it happen.

5400
03:23:34,070 --> 03:23:35,910
Can I get a Goku cut?

5401
03:23:38,410 --> 03:23:39,850
I can be Goku.

5402
03:23:40,430 --> 03:23:40,790
Yeah.

5403
03:23:40,810 --> 03:23:41,530
Let's get the Yu.

5404
03:23:41,570 --> 03:23:42,070
Oh my gosh.

5405
03:23:42,170 --> 03:23:42,490
Yugi.

5406
03:23:44,250 --> 03:23:44,770
But yeah.

5407
03:23:44,950 --> 03:23:46,770
So they kind of specialize in that.

5408
03:23:47,370 --> 03:23:48,590
And like on the inside.

5409
03:23:48,750 --> 03:23:49,270
You can't see.

5410
03:23:49,390 --> 03:23:50,410
Let me see if I can.

5411
03:23:55,130 --> 03:23:55,490
No.

5412
03:23:55,530 --> 03:23:56,310
It's still covered.

5413
03:23:57,430 --> 03:23:57,970
Oh yeah.

5414
03:23:57,990 --> 03:23:58,590
You can see here.

5415
03:23:58,750 --> 03:24:01,170
Like there's all this manga and everything on the walls.

5416
03:24:01,490 --> 03:24:01,890
Oh yeah.

5417
03:24:01,930 --> 03:24:02,350
You can see here.

5418
03:24:02,790 --> 03:24:03,430
The cut.

5419
03:24:03,570 --> 03:24:04,050
The color.

5420
03:24:04,650 --> 03:24:05,590
The head spa.

5421
03:24:05,790 --> 03:24:06,470
The treatment.

5422
03:24:07,590 --> 03:24:07,950
Yeah.

5423
03:24:09,590 --> 03:24:10,310
Hi Mylish.

5424
03:24:11,570 --> 03:24:11,930
Oh.

5425
03:24:12,090 --> 03:24:13,850
I don't think this hotomoto is here anymore.

5426
03:24:15,050 --> 03:24:15,410
Yeah.

5427
03:24:18,370 --> 03:24:18,930
Ugh.

5428
03:24:21,190 --> 03:24:22,010
But um.

5429
03:24:23,190 --> 03:24:23,750
Woo.

5430
03:24:23,870 --> 03:24:24,530
Those prices.

5431
03:24:24,830 --> 03:24:25,790
I'm gonna be honest.

5432
03:24:26,910 --> 03:24:28,030
These prices.

5433
03:24:28,590 --> 03:24:29,950
Are extremely.

5434
03:24:30,270 --> 03:24:32,510
Actually these are on the better side of Japan.

5435
03:24:32,930 --> 03:24:33,930
Not gonna lie.

5436
03:24:37,570 --> 03:24:39,410
This is from 2021 so.

5437
03:24:39,630 --> 03:24:41,390
I don't know if it's any different but.

5438
03:24:41,610 --> 03:24:43,490
This is really normal for.

5439
03:24:44,130 --> 03:24:45,510
Hair salon in Japan.

5440
03:24:46,330 --> 03:24:48,130
There are some cheaper ones.

5441
03:24:48,230 --> 03:24:49,270
There was one that's a chain.

5442
03:24:49,370 --> 03:24:50,290
I don't remember it.

5443
03:24:51,430 --> 03:24:52,070
But um.

5444
03:24:53,050 --> 03:24:53,610
Yeah.

5445
03:24:55,170 --> 03:24:56,710
5000 yen for a haircut.

5446
03:24:59,670 --> 03:25:00,230
Look.

5447
03:25:00,230 --> 03:25:01,490
You're getting the Goku.

5448
03:25:02,030 --> 03:25:03,410
You're getting the Goku.

5449
03:25:03,550 --> 03:25:04,390
What do you expect?

5450
03:25:10,210 --> 03:25:10,490
Sorry.

5451
03:25:10,630 --> 03:25:11,510
I'm finishing my drink.

5452
03:25:11,790 --> 03:25:13,870
I got some Thai tea earlier.

5453
03:25:16,070 --> 03:25:16,750
But yeah.

5454
03:25:18,470 --> 03:25:18,930
So if you're wondering.

5455
03:25:19,090 --> 03:25:20,270
Where the heck are we?

5456
03:25:20,850 --> 03:25:22,110
If you go down here.

5457
03:25:22,350 --> 03:25:23,410
Oh I'm gonna go back to 2023.

5458
03:25:23,810 --> 03:25:25,090
Cause things have changed.

5459
03:25:25,490 --> 03:25:26,550
If you go down here.

5460
03:25:28,810 --> 03:25:30,110
If you're here.

5461
03:25:30,370 --> 03:25:31,070
You're just like.

5462
03:25:31,190 --> 03:25:31,930
Where the heck are we?

5463
03:25:32,430 --> 03:25:33,370
I'll show you.

5464
03:25:38,050 --> 03:25:38,570
Please.

5465
03:25:38,830 --> 03:25:39,170
Please.

5466
03:25:39,350 --> 03:25:40,890
Take bigger steps please.

5467
03:25:42,730 --> 03:25:44,450
Take bigger steps please.

5468
03:25:44,450 --> 03:25:44,570
Please.

5469
03:25:46,490 --> 03:25:46,950
Look.

5470
03:25:48,450 --> 03:25:49,730
You can kinda read it.

5471
03:25:49,890 --> 03:25:50,250
There.

5472
03:25:51,750 --> 03:25:52,810
It's the Tam Tam.

5473
03:25:53,470 --> 03:25:54,610
That we were at before.

5474
03:25:58,290 --> 03:25:58,750
Gaptrox.

5475
03:25:58,830 --> 03:25:59,390
Welcome to membership.

5476
03:25:59,530 --> 03:25:59,850
Thank you.

5477
03:25:59,990 --> 03:26:02,130
Can I have a Saitama haircut too?

5478
03:26:02,410 --> 03:26:03,270
Yeah you can.

5479
03:26:04,410 --> 03:26:05,370
Traffic is bad.

5480
03:26:06,350 --> 03:26:07,610
We're back at the Tam Tam.

5481
03:26:09,990 --> 03:26:11,330
So right there.

5482
03:26:11,330 --> 03:26:12,230
Is Suehirobashi.

5483
03:26:14,730 --> 03:26:16,530
And this is all Chuo-dori.

5484
03:26:18,130 --> 03:26:18,850
And then.

5485
03:26:18,930 --> 03:26:19,570
Down here.

5486
03:26:21,210 --> 03:26:21,890
Oh no.

5487
03:26:21,970 --> 03:26:22,250
Sorry.

5488
03:26:22,390 --> 03:26:22,870
Wrong street.

5489
03:26:31,190 --> 03:26:32,910
This is Culture Zone.

5490
03:26:34,710 --> 03:26:36,490
Down here is Culture Zone.

5491
03:26:36,890 --> 03:26:38,370
And this is Chubbymaid Cafe.

5492
03:26:40,090 --> 03:26:41,390
This is old lady.

5493
03:26:43,470 --> 03:26:43,950
This is old lady.

5494
03:26:43,950 --> 03:26:44,290
Old lady.

5495
03:26:44,390 --> 03:26:46,650
The old lady Sasquatch.

5496
03:26:46,890 --> 03:26:47,990
Of Akihabara.

5497
03:26:51,910 --> 03:26:55,530
What's the idol landscape like now compared to say 10 to 15 years ago?

5498
03:26:55,850 --> 03:26:55,970
What's the idol landscape like now compared to say 10 to 15 years ago?

5499
03:26:55,970 --> 03:27:00,370
Do current idols look at 48 slash Hello Project Golden Era as a big deal?

5500
03:27:00,490 --> 03:27:02,010
Or is that now considered boomer tier?

5501
03:27:02,230 --> 03:27:03,070
Thanks for the tour.

5502
03:27:03,310 --> 03:27:04,230
Thanks for the question.

5503
03:27:05,810 --> 03:27:06,290
I...

5504
03:27:07,130 --> 03:27:09,630
I think now it is kind of boomer...

5505
03:27:09,830 --> 03:27:10,530
territory.

5506
03:27:10,810 --> 03:27:15,470
There's like a bunch of groups and heroines that are kind of the up and coming stuff.

5507
03:27:16,250 --> 03:27:21,010
Groups that are idols that are big on TikTok are kind of what's like taking over.

5508
03:27:21,550 --> 03:27:22,110
Because...

5509
03:27:23,470 --> 03:27:24,030
Um...

5510
03:27:24,610 --> 03:27:27,250
A lot of girls have been getting more into idols.

5511
03:27:28,290 --> 03:27:30,550
Especially like there's a group called iLife.

5512
03:27:31,570 --> 03:27:32,490
That's really popular.

5513
03:27:32,690 --> 03:27:34,230
They're part of heroines.

5514
03:27:36,250 --> 03:27:38,370
But I would say that yeah.

5515
03:27:38,450 --> 03:27:39,370
And also...

5516
03:27:39,950 --> 03:27:42,690
Kpop has influenced stuff a ton.

5517
03:27:43,610 --> 03:27:44,090
So...

5518
03:27:45,850 --> 03:27:46,810
So yeah.

5519
03:27:46,950 --> 03:27:47,690
Fruit Zipper.

5520
03:27:47,790 --> 03:27:50,070
Fruit Zipper is really big right now.

5521
03:27:51,690 --> 03:27:53,450
It is kind of like...

5522
03:27:54,470 --> 03:27:58,010
Not to say that there's not people that still admire Hello Project.

5523
03:27:58,250 --> 03:28:02,830
Because Hello Project is still a group and of course AKB is still a group and everything but...

5524
03:28:04,890 --> 03:28:05,370
Yeah...

5525
03:28:06,350 --> 03:28:09,930
The whole wave of chika idols that take after Ohmori Seiko are fun.

5526
03:28:12,210 --> 03:28:12,790
Yeah...

5527
03:28:14,670 --> 03:28:15,830
Yeah, yeah...

5528
03:28:16,790 --> 03:28:17,370
Um...

5529
03:28:18,130 --> 03:28:19,270
So... I don't know.

5530
03:28:19,450 --> 03:28:20,210
It's hard to say.

5531
03:28:24,140 --> 03:28:25,560
Times just grow and change.

5532
03:28:25,700 --> 03:28:26,080
That's all.

5533
03:28:26,220 --> 03:28:26,780
Exactly.

5534
03:28:27,380 --> 03:28:28,340
Exactly, exactly.

5535
03:28:29,620 --> 03:28:30,200
Hmm...

5536
03:28:30,200 --> 03:28:35,220
When I was in Japan last, I went to Tower Records.

5537
03:28:36,280 --> 03:28:37,340
And um...

5538
03:28:38,160 --> 03:28:42,400
As I was walking in, there was a big group of people and I was like, whoa, what's going on?

5539
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:47,380
And there was AKB signing a big poster in the front of the store.

5540
03:28:48,560 --> 03:28:52,740
And I thought to myself, I was like, if this had been me...

5541
03:28:53,980 --> 03:28:54,380
Like...

5542
03:28:55,180 --> 03:29:01,960
If this had been me 10 years ago, I would have probably... I would have auto-conned it all over the floor.

5543
03:29:02,180 --> 03:29:04,100
I would have auto-conned all over the floor.

5544
03:29:04,380 --> 03:29:05,820
I would have been like...

5545
03:29:07,460 --> 03:29:07,860
Like...

5546
03:29:09,280 --> 03:29:10,160
I would have lost my mind.

5547
03:29:11,100 --> 03:29:11,520
But...

5548
03:29:13,540 --> 03:29:13,960
Um...

5549
03:29:15,500 --> 03:29:17,480
But I kind of was just like, oh, that's neat.

5550
03:29:17,640 --> 03:29:18,580
And then I went on my way.

5551
03:29:21,120 --> 03:29:23,160
Not a fan of that verb.

5552
03:29:23,980 --> 03:29:25,460
Don't say it like that!

5553
03:29:26,660 --> 03:29:28,160
But you know what I mean!

5554
03:29:41,990 --> 03:29:42,950
Don't say it like that!

5555
03:29:45,130 --> 03:29:45,610
Anyway...

5556
03:29:47,410 --> 03:29:53,110
Well, I've skipped over a bunch of stuff, but I think this might be a good place to call it.

5557
03:29:54,250 --> 03:29:54,730
Um...

5558
03:29:56,530 --> 03:29:59,730
Oh wait, we were gonna go back in time for the...

5559
03:30:01,730 --> 03:30:02,670
For the...

5560
03:30:04,890 --> 03:30:05,410
Um...

5561
03:30:06,970 --> 03:30:07,490
Um...

5562
03:30:07,490 --> 03:30:07,770
Um...

5563
03:30:07,770 --> 03:30:09,210
The OL Cafe, maybe.

5564
03:30:09,810 --> 03:30:12,310
I've been actually quite tired because...

5565
03:30:12,930 --> 03:30:13,450
Um...

5566
03:30:13,450 --> 03:30:14,410
Okay, guys.

5567
03:30:15,710 --> 03:30:16,230
Announcement!

5568
03:30:17,610 --> 03:30:19,370
Actually, some of you already know this.

5569
03:30:19,490 --> 03:30:21,030
But that's okay, if you are on the Patreon.

5570
03:30:23,730 --> 03:30:25,530
I got a second cat!

5571
03:30:26,950 --> 03:30:30,470
I thought auto-conned meant the other thing he's known for doing.

5572
03:30:31,470 --> 03:30:31,990
Hm?

5573
03:30:33,390 --> 03:30:34,270
What's that?

5574
03:30:34,530 --> 03:30:35,270
Wait, actually...

5575
03:30:35,270 --> 03:30:37,070
Thank you, man.

5576
03:30:37,170 --> 03:30:37,630
No, thank you!

5577
03:30:38,330 --> 03:30:39,770
Yeah, I got another cat!

5578
03:30:40,750 --> 03:30:42,570
She's so cute!

5579
03:30:43,390 --> 03:30:48,670
I hadn't announced it sooner because I was kind of wanting to see how...

5580
03:30:48,670 --> 03:30:49,470
Um...

5581
03:30:49,470 --> 03:30:54,330
How Butaro reacted to her.

5582
03:30:54,710 --> 03:30:55,990
Um, but...

5583
03:30:56,670 --> 03:30:58,970
They're getting along-ish.

5584
03:30:59,270 --> 03:31:01,430
They're only hissing sometimes.

5585
03:31:04,090 --> 03:31:04,450
Um...

5586
03:31:04,450 --> 03:31:06,950
But I didn't want to say it sooner because I was like, what if she...

5587
03:31:07,610 --> 03:31:10,510
What if she doesn't get along with my cat and...

5588
03:31:11,130 --> 03:31:11,490
Um...

5589
03:31:11,490 --> 03:31:13,210
Then I have to like, you know...

5590
03:31:13,210 --> 03:31:15,250
What if it's like really bad to the point...

5591
03:31:15,250 --> 03:31:16,650
Mint, you already told us?

5592
03:31:16,830 --> 03:31:17,750
Not on stream!

5593
03:31:19,410 --> 03:31:21,490
Wait, I told you guys yesterday?

5594
03:31:25,390 --> 03:31:25,910
I did?

5595
03:31:26,990 --> 03:31:27,350
...

5596
03:31:27,350 --> 03:31:27,550
...

5597
03:31:27,550 --> 03:31:27,930
...

5598
03:31:27,930 --> 03:31:28,330
...

5599
03:31:31,170 --> 03:31:32,730
I told you yesterday?

5600
03:31:33,450 --> 03:31:33,890
...

5601
03:31:45,930 --> 03:31:47,630
You said you didn't want to say it, but you did.

5602
03:31:48,530 --> 03:31:48,970
...

5603
03:31:53,040 --> 03:31:53,480
Okay.

5604
03:31:53,480 --> 03:31:54,280
Well, okay.

5605
03:31:54,400 --> 03:31:56,420
Let me explain why I've been so tired then.

5606
03:31:57,920 --> 03:32:00,040
Because, do you know how exhausting?

5607
03:32:00,300 --> 03:32:03,040
It's been like taking care of like two babies.

5608
03:32:03,520 --> 03:32:14,220
Where like, I have to keep one cat in a separate room, and then another cat, and I let them go, and I let them... and I do stuff with them, and then also trying to get them to like each other, and...

5609
03:32:15,580 --> 03:32:16,960
I am pretty tired.

5610
03:32:17,120 --> 03:32:22,580
Okay, I'm gonna take tomorrow... Well, I'm not taking tomorrow off because I'm actually quite busy tomorrow, but...

5611
03:32:23,560 --> 03:32:24,980
Is the new cat just a kitten?

5612
03:32:25,340 --> 03:32:26,800
She's about one years old.

5613
03:32:27,820 --> 03:32:29,220
So... She's pretty kitten.

5614
03:32:33,230 --> 03:32:34,110
I'm so sorry.

5615
03:32:34,690 --> 03:32:36,490
When did I say that I told you guys?

5616
03:32:39,750 --> 03:32:40,770
When did I say?

5617
03:32:41,990 --> 03:32:45,390
When did I say?

5618
03:32:45,730 --> 03:32:47,670
A singular years old.

5619
03:32:49,990 --> 03:32:51,550
Kind of past the kitten age?

5620
03:32:53,090 --> 03:32:53,970
Yes, but...

5621
03:32:55,090 --> 03:32:55,830
Last night?

5622
03:32:55,970 --> 03:32:57,330
Yeah, but like when last night?

5623
03:32:57,410 --> 03:32:58,610
Gosh, I don't remember at all.

5624
03:32:58,790 --> 03:33:02,130
No, I know I did bunny garden yesterday, but I don't remember when I said it last night.

5625
03:33:03,270 --> 03:33:04,470
Someone asked about it?

5626
03:33:04,550 --> 03:33:08,090
Oh, when I was... That's probably why I don't remember because...

5627
03:33:08,990 --> 03:33:09,430
I...

5628
03:33:11,290 --> 03:33:12,170
Because I...

5629
03:33:13,790 --> 03:33:18,290
Because I was thinking of, you know... Because it was brought up as a super chat.

5630
03:33:18,510 --> 03:33:19,190
Okay, I remember.

5631
03:33:19,370 --> 03:33:20,470
I remember now!

5632
03:33:21,650 --> 03:33:22,690
I remember now.

5633
03:33:22,810 --> 03:33:23,350
I remember now.

5634
03:33:26,870 --> 03:33:28,450
Yeah, I said the new one wasn't stinky.

5635
03:33:28,630 --> 03:33:29,350
I remember.

5636
03:33:29,490 --> 03:33:29,770
I remember.

5637
03:33:29,950 --> 03:33:30,290
I remember.

5638
03:33:30,990 --> 03:33:38,950
I also have to remember that with bunny garden, my brain was entirely on the assets.

5639
03:33:40,790 --> 03:33:41,590
I remember.

5640
03:33:41,790 --> 03:33:42,070
I remember.

5641
03:33:42,870 --> 03:33:43,970
Wasn't yesterday mahjong?

5642
03:33:44,170 --> 03:33:44,970
Yeah, it was mahjong.

5643
03:33:47,330 --> 03:33:48,510
Now I'm confused.

5644
03:33:48,770 --> 03:33:51,010
You guys said... You guys are older than I am.

5645
03:33:51,090 --> 03:33:53,190
You guys said... You said bunny garden yesterday.

5646
03:33:56,690 --> 03:33:57,950
Yesterday was mahjong.

5647
03:34:05,320 --> 03:34:06,520
You guys said...

5648
03:34:06,520 --> 03:34:08,460
You guys are gaslighting me.

5649
03:34:08,600 --> 03:34:10,220
You guys said bunny garden.

5650
03:34:13,060 --> 03:34:14,600
Then it was two days ago.

5651
03:34:15,100 --> 03:34:16,440
We are tired too.

5652
03:34:19,260 --> 03:34:21,300
It was bunny garden because I missed yesterday.

5653
03:34:22,120 --> 03:34:22,980
Well, then there we go.

5654
03:34:23,340 --> 03:34:25,160
I was focused on the assets, okay?

5655
03:34:25,660 --> 03:34:28,960
And then mahjong made me leak through my ears.

5656
03:34:29,620 --> 03:34:30,020
So...

5657
03:34:31,940 --> 03:34:33,460
Okay, grandma.

5658
03:34:33,520 --> 03:34:34,080
Time for bed.

5659
03:34:35,480 --> 03:34:36,140
Shut up!

5660
03:34:38,320 --> 03:34:39,280
Thanks for the torment!

5661
03:34:39,620 --> 03:34:41,420
Always fun to see you gush over things you love.

5662
03:34:41,500 --> 03:34:42,540
Hope the new cat does well.

5663
03:34:42,620 --> 03:34:42,840
Thanks!

5664
03:34:42,920 --> 03:34:43,140
Thank you!

5665
03:34:43,400 --> 03:34:50,280
I hope that this was different enough from the last time that I did the tour so that, you know, you could see...

5666
03:34:51,300 --> 03:34:53,200
Hopefully hear some new things.

5667
03:34:53,380 --> 03:34:58,740
I mean, things have updated in Akihabara and the unfortunate thing is there's cars blocking the way.

5668
03:34:58,840 --> 03:35:03,480
But also, we don't have like you know, a 2024 map yet.

5669
03:35:03,760 --> 03:35:06,360
But next time I go, I will...

5670
03:35:07,760 --> 03:35:12,600
I will take some footage myself and I will share it with you guys.

5671
03:35:12,920 --> 03:35:13,420
Where is...

5672
03:35:14,140 --> 03:35:15,640
Where are the OLs?

5673
03:35:16,860 --> 03:35:18,560
Just giving the tour guide a tip.

5674
03:35:18,640 --> 03:35:18,980
I hope...

5675
03:35:19,780 --> 03:35:20,220
Oh!

5676
03:35:20,340 --> 03:35:20,780
A tip!

5677
03:35:20,860 --> 03:35:23,160
I thought you meant you were telling me like a...

5678
03:35:24,080 --> 03:35:26,020
Like a tip as in like...

5679
03:35:27,120 --> 03:35:27,560
Advice.

5680
03:35:28,700 --> 03:35:31,120
Thank you so much for the spooky super chat!

5681
03:35:31,580 --> 03:35:33,920
Hope to visit Akiba someday so I was taking notes.

5682
03:35:34,040 --> 03:35:36,060
Maybe I can go see the maid mint maid cafe.

5683
03:35:37,800 --> 03:35:41,120
I hope one day I can collab with the maid cafe.

5684
03:35:41,480 --> 03:35:42,340
That'd be crazy.

5685
03:35:44,420 --> 03:35:45,320
Maybe one day.

5686
03:35:45,600 --> 03:35:46,800
I gotta get bigger.

5687
03:35:49,540 --> 03:35:50,920
Maybe I gotta get bigger.

5688
03:35:52,540 --> 03:35:53,500
Where are we at?

5689
03:35:53,560 --> 03:35:53,960
2013.

5690
03:35:54,200 --> 03:35:55,960
No, no, no, no, no.

5691
03:35:56,900 --> 03:35:57,980
No, no, no.

5692
03:35:58,040 --> 03:36:00,080
I think 2022 is our best bet.

5693
03:36:00,760 --> 03:36:03,420
Cause it has moved around a little bit.

5694
03:36:04,600 --> 03:36:05,680
The OL cafe.

5695
03:36:12,220 --> 03:36:13,220
I'll find it.

5696
03:36:19,540 --> 03:36:20,020
Someday.

5697
03:36:21,520 --> 03:36:22,360
Here's a tip.

5698
03:36:22,440 --> 03:36:23,540
Don't quit your day job.

5699
03:36:23,800 --> 03:36:24,160
Ayo!

5700
03:36:26,400 --> 03:36:27,320
Here's an advice.

5701
03:36:27,480 --> 03:36:28,300
Take this tip.

5702
03:36:28,420 --> 03:36:28,700
Stop.

5703
03:36:30,900 --> 03:36:31,540
Ayo!

5704
03:36:32,460 --> 03:36:37,020
Who would quit their day job to stream?

5705
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:38,180
That's so...

5706
03:36:38,840 --> 03:36:39,480
silly.

5707
03:36:40,980 --> 03:36:45,220
That's actually like the worst idea ever.

5708
03:36:47,580 --> 03:36:48,620
That's like...

5709
03:36:49,320 --> 03:36:50,800
Who would risk it all?

5710
03:36:51,320 --> 03:36:52,980
Who would risk it for the biscuit?

5711
03:36:57,770 --> 03:36:58,730
Who would risk it for the biscuit?

5712
03:36:59,330 --> 03:37:00,930
This is so much fun, you guys.

5713
03:37:03,090 --> 03:37:07,110
I thought I would have to cancel because my head has been hurting these past couple of days.

5714
03:37:07,170 --> 03:37:11,410
Probably because I've been just a little stressed out about the cats.

5715
03:37:12,310 --> 03:37:13,990
And just some other stuff too.

5716
03:37:16,310 --> 03:37:16,790
But...

5717
03:37:18,590 --> 03:37:19,270
You know.

5718
03:37:19,590 --> 03:37:21,410
I'm doing my best.

5719
03:37:23,470 --> 03:37:24,350
Going in October.

5720
03:37:24,470 --> 03:37:26,050
This gave me some great ideas on where to go.

5721
03:37:26,150 --> 03:37:26,530
Thanks, man.

5722
03:37:26,910 --> 03:37:27,450
Thanks, bro.

5723
03:37:27,730 --> 03:37:28,530
Oh my gosh.

5724
03:37:28,570 --> 03:37:29,830
I can't wait to hear all about it.

5725
03:37:30,950 --> 03:37:33,150
You can be the Anna Miller's mascot.

5726
03:37:33,510 --> 03:37:34,650
Because they're dead too.

5727
03:37:35,010 --> 03:37:35,990
Who's Anna Miller?

5728
03:37:41,910 --> 03:37:43,110
I'm going to Japan in September.

5729
03:37:43,210 --> 03:37:43,890
Thank you for the recs.

5730
03:37:43,890 --> 03:37:44,510
Yeah, of course.

5731
03:37:44,590 --> 03:37:44,890
Of course.

5732
03:37:44,910 --> 03:37:45,250
Of course.

5733
03:37:47,290 --> 03:37:47,650
But...

5734
03:37:49,530 --> 03:37:50,090
Yes.

5735
03:37:51,110 --> 03:37:51,670
Yes.

5736
03:37:52,910 --> 03:37:53,470
But...

5737
03:37:53,470 --> 03:37:54,950
I'm going to rest tomorrow.

5738
03:37:55,390 --> 03:37:57,890
And hope you guys liked this tour.

5739
03:37:58,470 --> 03:37:59,030
Hopefully...

5740
03:37:59,650 --> 03:38:01,450
I'm glad if it gave you some recommendations.

5741
03:38:01,450 --> 03:38:04,130
Some ideas of how to get around Akihabara.

5742
03:38:04,210 --> 03:38:07,470
So when you go, you don't feel entirely lost or overwhelmed.

5743
03:38:08,130 --> 03:38:08,690
And...

5744
03:38:09,490 --> 03:38:09,770
Yeah.

5745
03:38:09,850 --> 03:38:11,070
Thank you for risking it.

5746
03:38:11,090 --> 03:38:12,450
Here's some money for the biscuits.

5747
03:38:12,750 --> 03:38:13,770
This tour was fun.

5748
03:38:13,830 --> 03:38:14,370
Thank you!

5749
03:38:14,830 --> 03:38:16,310
Yeah, we'll do a part 2.

5750
03:38:17,650 --> 03:38:19,650
Do you see the Kanda Myojin Muse stairs down here too?

5751
03:38:19,750 --> 03:38:20,530
Yes, it is!

5752
03:38:23,370 --> 03:38:24,150
Right here!

5753
03:38:28,150 --> 03:38:30,210
This is actually the stairs to...

5754
03:38:30,210 --> 03:38:31,370
Oh, that's a wall.

5755
03:38:32,010 --> 03:38:34,070
This is the stairs to Kanda Myojin.

5756
03:38:34,450 --> 03:38:36,690
The stairs that they go to in Love Live.

5757
03:38:39,750 --> 03:38:41,170
That they run up and down.

5758
03:38:43,350 --> 03:38:44,590
Thanks for reminding me.

5759
03:38:45,330 --> 03:38:47,390
What do you feed for your new kitty?

5760
03:38:47,650 --> 03:38:53,610
I don't really want to get into it because I've been a little stressed about it.

5761
03:38:54,730 --> 03:38:55,530
Basically, my...

5762
03:38:55,530 --> 03:38:56,190
My...

5763
03:38:57,270 --> 03:38:58,590
Butaro, he stopped eating.

5764
03:38:59,010 --> 03:39:02,910
When I took him to the vet, they were like, he's really healthy, but he's lost 2 pounds.

5765
03:39:04,130 --> 03:39:04,910
And so...

5766
03:39:05,310 --> 03:39:07,670
I was really stressed about that because he had...

5767
03:39:07,670 --> 03:39:12,670
I kept having to give him some medicine which would stress him out because he had something going on on his arm.

5768
03:39:13,150 --> 03:39:14,470
And so that was stressing him out.

5769
03:39:14,470 --> 03:39:15,610
And then stressing him out.

5770
03:39:15,670 --> 03:39:17,210
And then the new cat was stressing him out.

5771
03:39:17,330 --> 03:39:18,930
And then he was getting skinny.

5772
03:39:19,410 --> 03:39:21,510
And so he just wasn't eating a lot.

5773
03:39:21,650 --> 03:39:22,150
And so...

5774
03:39:24,370 --> 03:39:26,610
I've had to start cooking him chicken.

5775
03:39:27,210 --> 03:39:28,470
Like actual chicken.

5776
03:39:28,710 --> 03:39:29,750
For him to eat.

5777
03:39:29,830 --> 03:39:31,130
He won't eat anything else.

5778
03:39:32,670 --> 03:39:34,030
My spoiled cat.

5779
03:39:34,930 --> 03:39:35,410
But...

5780
03:39:37,930 --> 03:39:38,410
But...

5781
03:39:39,070 --> 03:39:39,990
But uh...

5782
03:39:41,830 --> 03:39:42,290
Uh...

5783
03:39:42,930 --> 03:39:43,390
So...

5784
03:39:43,390 --> 03:39:45,990
Yeah, I was really stressed about that because I was...

5785
03:39:45,990 --> 03:39:49,050
I would just like sit there trying to get him to eat anything.

5786
03:39:49,370 --> 03:39:53,010
And I was just like sitting on the floor crying trying to get my cat to eat.

5787
03:39:55,890 --> 03:39:56,350
So...

5788
03:39:56,870 --> 03:39:58,530
Sorry if my brain is scattered.

5789
03:39:59,170 --> 03:40:00,190
It's just been...

5790
03:40:00,190 --> 03:40:01,650
And then I've been trying to...

5791
03:40:02,970 --> 03:40:06,750
Get my maid cafe ready for when Mataro visits.

5792
03:40:07,150 --> 03:40:09,350
So I've been trying to read and rearrange some stuff.

5793
03:40:10,370 --> 03:40:10,770
Um...

5794
03:40:12,170 --> 03:40:12,570
Yeah...

5795
03:40:13,290 --> 03:40:14,370
Anyway, sorry.

5796
03:40:14,510 --> 03:40:16,150
I didn't mean to bother you guys with all that.

5797
03:40:16,350 --> 03:40:17,010
I try not to...

5798
03:40:17,010 --> 03:40:19,310
I try not to show it on stream.

5799
03:40:19,550 --> 03:40:22,830
But if I'm scatterbrained because I'm stressed I'm really sorry.

5800
03:40:25,670 --> 03:40:26,070
Um...

5801
03:40:28,370 --> 03:40:28,950
But yeah.

5802
03:40:29,170 --> 03:40:30,950
I try not to show it on stream.

5803
03:40:31,010 --> 03:40:32,290
I try not to bother you guys with it.

5804
03:40:32,350 --> 03:40:33,750
So we can just have a fun time, right?

5805
03:40:34,470 --> 03:40:34,870
Um...

5806
03:40:36,190 --> 03:40:37,410
This tour was awesome!

5807
03:40:38,410 --> 03:40:41,210
I'm going to find this bot and mark down all the places I want to go to for my own trip.

5808
03:40:41,310 --> 03:40:42,310
Thank you, MeetMop!

5809
03:40:42,610 --> 03:40:43,430
Thank you, Tal!

5810
03:40:43,890 --> 03:40:44,330
MeetMop!

5811
03:40:47,090 --> 03:40:48,030
What are those stairs?

5812
03:40:48,190 --> 03:40:48,570
Your name?

5813
03:40:48,630 --> 03:40:48,970
No, no!

5814
03:40:49,050 --> 03:40:51,690
These are the stairs that lead up to Kanda Myojin.

5815
03:40:51,850 --> 03:40:53,730
The stairs in Love Live!

5816
03:40:54,830 --> 03:40:56,050
The stairs that they...

5817
03:40:56,050 --> 03:40:56,830
It's a different anime.

5818
03:40:57,650 --> 03:40:58,290
But look.

5819
03:40:58,430 --> 03:40:59,070
Kanda Myojin.

5820
03:41:00,270 --> 03:41:00,710
Wow!

5821
03:41:01,430 --> 03:41:01,870
Wow!

5822
03:41:03,050 --> 03:41:04,010
The sakura!

5823
03:41:04,290 --> 03:41:04,690
Wow!

5824
03:41:10,750 --> 03:41:11,630
Oh my gosh!

5825
03:41:11,710 --> 03:41:12,090
Hanami!

5826
03:41:12,310 --> 03:41:13,030
In my stream!

5827
03:41:15,010 --> 03:41:15,490
Wow!

5828
03:41:15,850 --> 03:41:16,330
Nice!

5829
03:41:16,610 --> 03:41:18,730
Extra snack funds for the kitty in the main.

5830
03:41:18,770 --> 03:41:19,410
Thank you.

5831
03:41:20,350 --> 03:41:21,590
Yeah, this is where...

5832
03:41:22,210 --> 03:41:23,670
Nozomi works in Love Live!

5833
03:41:23,770 --> 03:41:24,550
There's also...

5834
03:41:24,550 --> 03:41:25,130
Um...

5835
03:41:27,310 --> 03:41:29,210
There's also a lot of gochiusa...

5836
03:41:29,890 --> 03:41:30,570
What's the word?

5837
03:41:30,670 --> 03:41:33,290
The little things that you write your wishes on.

5838
03:41:33,490 --> 03:41:36,190
If you go to these...

5839
03:41:36,190 --> 03:41:36,510
Um...

5840
03:41:36,510 --> 03:41:38,830
There used to be a lot of love live and gochiusa.

5841
03:41:40,690 --> 03:41:41,370
Good tour.

5842
03:41:41,510 --> 03:41:42,650
100% spoiled kitty.

5843
03:41:42,890 --> 03:41:43,750
Yes, he is.

5844
03:41:45,950 --> 03:41:46,630
But um...

5845
03:41:46,630 --> 03:41:46,810
Yeah!

5846
03:41:48,250 --> 03:41:50,070
I'm going to go sleep now.

5847
03:41:50,790 --> 03:41:51,410
Actually, no.

5848
03:41:51,510 --> 03:41:52,950
I have some cleaning I need to do.

5849
03:41:54,990 --> 03:41:55,430
But...

5850
03:41:55,430 --> 03:41:56,370
Thank you guys.

5851
03:41:57,510 --> 03:41:58,210
Hold on.

5852
03:42:07,270 --> 03:42:08,810
I hope you enjoyed the tour.

5853
03:42:11,170 --> 03:42:12,310
Don't mind that I'm huge.

5854
03:42:13,130 --> 03:42:13,710
It's a perspective thing.

5855
03:42:18,880 --> 03:42:19,620
It's perspective.

5856
03:42:20,660 --> 03:42:21,940
I'm not a giant or anything.

5857
03:42:22,140 --> 03:42:23,640
I'm not going to crush these people or anything.

5858
03:42:23,820 --> 03:42:24,500
I'm not a giant.

5859
03:42:25,200 --> 03:42:26,140
I'm not a giant.

5860
03:42:34,440 --> 03:42:34,820
Ah!

5861
03:42:34,820 --> 03:42:35,200
Splatter!

5862
03:43:02,260 --> 03:43:02,640
Cheese!

5863
03:43:03,280 --> 03:43:03,660
Cheese!

5864
03:43:03,660 --> 03:43:04,260
I can't help you.

5865
03:43:04,280 --> 03:43:04,560
Cheese!

5866
03:43:05,980 --> 03:43:06,540
Hold on.

5867
03:43:06,640 --> 03:43:07,920
I don't want to look like a nerd.

5868
03:43:11,340 --> 03:43:11,780
Cheese!

5869
03:43:11,780 --> 03:43:12,220
Cheese!

5870
03:43:12,360 --> 03:43:12,800
Cheese!

5871
03:43:12,820 --> 03:43:12,940
Cheese!

5872
03:43:12,940 --> 03:43:13,160
Cheese!

5873
03:43:13,160 --> 03:43:13,360
Cheese!

5874
03:43:13,620 --> 03:43:14,560
Thank you guys!

5875
03:43:14,700 --> 03:43:16,060
This is where we'll end the tour.

5876
03:43:16,440 --> 03:43:19,160
This is where, we will end the tour for today.

5877
03:43:19,560 --> 03:43:20,200
For now.

5878
03:43:20,540 --> 03:43:22,640
Until I have more places to recommend you.

5879
03:43:22,960 --> 03:43:24,060
The next time I go.

5880
03:43:26,440 --> 03:43:28,020
This is a nice spot and the...

5881
03:43:28,020 --> 03:43:29,420
Mm hmm...

5882
03:43:30,720 --> 03:43:32,060
It's a beautiful sunny day.

5883
03:43:32,760 --> 03:43:34,140
The flowers are blooming.

5884
03:43:36,060 --> 03:43:37,900
My allergies are acting up.

5885
03:43:38,060 --> 03:43:38,500
Um...

5886
03:43:40,340 --> 03:43:48,600
I went to a chika idol taiban in Kanda Myojin Culture Center back during my first trip here in December.

5887
03:43:48,760 --> 03:43:49,740
Free cheki is so good.

5888
03:43:49,840 --> 03:43:53,380
Yeah, a lot of groups have been doing the free cheki thing for the first time you see it.

5889
03:43:53,460 --> 03:43:54,820
For the first time you see them.

5890
03:43:56,080 --> 03:43:58,660
The live stream was so much fun!

5891
03:43:59,200 --> 03:44:00,180
Thank you BashaMins!

5892
03:44:02,140 --> 03:44:03,140
Thank you!

5893
03:44:06,020 --> 03:44:09,240
Thank you guys.

5894
03:44:12,400 --> 03:44:15,100
Like I said, we'll do a part 2.

5895
03:44:15,860 --> 03:44:16,680
Bless you.

5896
03:44:17,120 --> 03:44:18,180
Thank you!

5897
03:44:22,380 --> 03:44:24,240
Hope you enjoyed it.

5898
03:44:26,480 --> 03:44:30,200
I don't know why I'm struggling to end this.

5899
03:44:31,520 --> 03:44:34,200
Maybe because I feel like I have so much more I could talk about.

5900
03:44:36,380 --> 03:44:37,160
Next time.

5901
03:44:38,040 --> 03:44:38,780
Next time.

5902
03:44:42,900 --> 03:44:44,740
Your passion lifts my spirits.

5903
