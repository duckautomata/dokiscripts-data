1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,230
Welcome back, Master and Ma'am!

2
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,130
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello!

3
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,770
Hello, everybody!

4
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,170
I was just saying...

5
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,050
In loading screen chat...

6
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,350
Welcome!

7
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,030
Welcome!

8
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,670
Please take a look!

9
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,250
I was just saying in loading chat...

10
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,270
Not quite pre-chat.

11
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,930
My computer has another strange sound.

12
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,410
I don't know what it is.

13
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,270
Just sometimes I hear like a...

14
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,950
It's not like my computer computer.

15
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,530
It's like...

16
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,230
On here.

17
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,730
Sometimes I just hear like a...

18
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:23,910
Thunk!

19
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,210
Thunk!

20
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:26,990
Hold on.

21
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,010
It happened when I was typing.

22
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:31,950
No!

23
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,950
It's a blast, but those last few levels are sadistic.

24
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,750
I heard...

25
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,270
Okay, so...

26
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,890
I heard...

27
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:50,610
That...

28
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,710
This game has like a real difficulty spike.

29
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,070
Hold on, I'm trying to see if I can activate the noise.

30
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,230
I'll tell you if it happens.

31
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,310
I can't guarantee if we'll beat the game today.

32
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,670
I do have a meeting tonight.

33
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:13,950
So...

34
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,070
Found your channel today thanks to a clip from a duo with...

35
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,410
Wow, thank you!

36
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,130
Thanks for coming to check me out!

37
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,150
Right now I'm...

38
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,750
I don't know.

39
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,230
You know what?

40
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,410
Nevermind, I give up.

41
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,850
If I hear it though, I'll be like...

42
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:33,490
That was it.

43
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,750
That was it!

44
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,130
I'm afraid you have multiple hauntings.

45
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,930
No, I don't know.

46
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,630
Is it coming from the case or the speakers?

47
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,590
From the speakers!

48
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,570
I don't know.

49
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,050
So mysterious.

50
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:51,850
Haunting.

51
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,590
Haunting.

52
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,310
I just heard it.

53
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,030
No you didn't!

54
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,690
This game sounds unrealistic.

55
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,050
Who would want to kiss a ghost?

56
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:04,930
P.S.

57
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,050
You smell.

58
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,250
Yeah, right!

59
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,910
Who would...

60
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,710
Who would want to kiss a ghost?

61
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,130
I'd be so...

62
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,890
Thanks for haunting us, Bito.

63
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,990
Thank you for letting me haunt you.

64
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,650
Yeah, I don't really know anything about this game besides what the trailer showed.

65
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,430
I don't know...

66
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,550
Like I said, I don't know if I'll be able to beat it today.

67
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,330
Or anything like that, but we'll see.

68
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,290
We will see.

69
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,670
Are you afraid of kissing ghosts?

70
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:44,850
No!

71
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,610
I want to kiss the ghosts.

72
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,230
I want to kiss the ghosts!

73
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,250
That's the goal.

74
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,210
Is to kiss the ghosts.

75
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,970
Saw Mint's stream on the Steam's Awaria Discord.

76
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,410
Wait, what?

77
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,470
No way.

78
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,490
All the invisible ghosts floating around you probably kissed thousands.

79
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,690
I mean...

80
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,830
I can see them.

81
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,310
So like...

82
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,130
Maybe you have.

83
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,750
But you can also see ghosts if you can see me.

84
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:27,910
Unless...

85
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,610
Do you think there's like...

86
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,830
Other ghosts?

87
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,770
Like beyond ghosts?

88
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,870
Do you think ghosts have ghosts?

89
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,330
I hope she doesn't carry salt.

90
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,320
Well, wait.

91
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,180
No salt.

92
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,280
I only got the chance to say I really enjoyed your performances on AWA last week and keep it up.

93
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,660
You're amazing.

94
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,120
Thanks, Paige!

95
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,320
I saw your picture with Emojie.

96
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,300
What do you know?

97
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,180
I'm a ghost.

98
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,760
What a marvelous coincidence.

99
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,320
Are you here to kiss ghosts?

100
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,490
The ghost ghost is a toast.

101
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,110
Known by the most.

102
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,270
Are we here to kiss ghosts?

103
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,870
Let's try.

104
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,810
To kiss a ghost.

105
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,790
Banger soundtrack, right?

106
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,910
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention this game is by the Helltaker dev.

107
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:40,970
So...

108
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,710
A little sadistic.

109
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,150
Probably.

110
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,330
We'll see.

111
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,250
I don't know.

112
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:48,730
Who knows?

113
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,370
I might game.

114
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,330
Right?

115
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:50,370
Wait.

116
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,770
Udoki and the girls did amazing at the concert.

117
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,830
Thank you, Croesus!

118
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,950
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,690
Lord Croesus.

120
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,330
Is the logo supposed to be off-center?

121
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,290
Yes.

122
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,190
Like, this is normal.

123
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:08,830
Yeah.

124
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,770
Minto Gaming.

125
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,530
I'm gaming.

126
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:12,650
I'm gaming.

127
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,810
Also, AKS, I read your letter.

128
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,510
Thank you.

129
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,170
I read your letter.

130
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,020
I read your letter.

131
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,300
I forgot to say about a letter I got.

132
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,160
I don't know.

133
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,900
Rezzy Ian.

134
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,420
I think I'm saying it right.

135
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,640
Rezzy Ian.

136
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,860
If you're here, you asked in your letter if you can do an Itasha.

137
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,840
Of course you can!

138
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,180
If anybody ever wants to do anything like that, of course you can.

139
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,760
Of course you can.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,280
I would be honored, honestly.

141
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,360
Who are you gonna call?

142
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:57,980
Ghostsmooters!

143
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,600
Oh, Lad!

144
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,660
Laddora!

145
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,900
Playing freaky game on my birthday.

146
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,920
Do you mind if I ask for the Minkius Metal Gear Solid birthday song, please?

147
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,020
Didn't you also send me a letter?

148
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,240
Sure!

149
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,240
Didn't you also send me one?

150
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,360
Sorry, I'm really bad about writing down.

151
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,600
I only get so excited about reading them.

152
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,020
I like open them all up and then like...

153
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,960
I like get excited about reading them and I'm like, wait a minute.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,380
But yes, of course I can sing!

155
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,940
Happy birthday, congratulations!

156
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,620
Happy birthday with salutations!

157
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,740
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue!

158
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,400
Happy birthday to you, Laddora!

159
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Happy birthday!

160
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,920
I love when Huey sings this song.

161
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,240
Shut up, Huey!

162
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,400
Cool.

163
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,000
Are we ready to try it?

164
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,340
Maybe.

165
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,860
Are we ready?

166
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,100
Saw you live in Atlanta over the weekend, you and Doki and everyone were fantastic!

167
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,600
It was my first concert ever too!

168
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,680
Wow, thanks for letting us be your first concert!

169
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,400
Thank you!

170
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,000
Ready?

171
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,440
Are we ready, guys?

172
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,480
I'm nervous.

173
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,640
I'm playing on mouse and keyboard.

174
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,060
Hopefully that's okay.

175
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,460
She's a phantom.

176
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,420
Mint phantom, phantom phantom.

177
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,860
Same winter sales happening, so I can gift Ace Combat 7 to otherwise.

178
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,180
I don't know if Matara ever accepted my gift.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,220
I'm not sure, actually.

180
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,120
I gifted her Ace Combat.

181
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,300
And then I got an email that was like, your gift has not been accepted yet.

182
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,560
And if it's not accepted, we're gonna give you a refund.

183
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,350
Chapter 1.

184
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,370
Zambora.

185
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,230
Word from your boss.

186
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,410
You must be the new girl.

187
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,330
That's me.

188
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,210
You want sector F?

189
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,210
It's yours.

190
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,630
Fix the generators and don't let those bitches kill you!

191
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,910
So standard... Oh no, no, no.

192
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,090
Let's try a standard mode.

193
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,890
Your drone will save you from death on a 10 second cooldown.

194
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,510
Time limit is... There's a time limit.

195
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,130
And drone cooldown is greatly reduced.

196
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,690
Drone is gone and generators die faster.

197
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,070
Good luck.

198
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:35,890
Oh my gosh.

199
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,630
Now let's just try standard mode, right?

200
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,890
Is that the bitch we're supposed to be looking out for?

201
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,210
Because I'm sweating.

202
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,790
Shut up, Liam!

203
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,770
Van Ripper is pretty cool making a game where you kiss demon girls in business suits.

204
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,790
To kissing ghost girls in skin tight suits.

205
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,630
So he can sell us his recipes for sweets.

206
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,570
Good luck on hard mode.

207
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,470
Oh, so

208
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,620
I go and what do I do?

209
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,180
Oh, enter.

210
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,420
Enter?

211
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,600
Enter.

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,180
Wait.

213
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,960
What am I doing?

214
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,280
Is there a tutorial that I should have done?

215
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,540
I think this is the tutorial.

216
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,960
I got the mechanics fixed.

217
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,940
This is the tutorial.

218
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,240
There's only one generator, so...

219
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,940
I'm just gonna keep having that go.

220
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,900
Watch out.

221
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,680
How are you supposed to...

222
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,860
How are you supposed to know?

223
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Oh my gosh.

224
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,180
OK, I get it.

225
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,360
Oh my gosh.

226
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,120
Why is the generator so fragile?

227
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,520
I guess I... Oh, I go check.

228
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,780
OK, I understand.

229
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,740
I go check.

230
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,340
Fixed!

231
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,740
Wow, that was so easy.

232
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,380
Smooch at the ghost.

233
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,920
Oh, my head.

234
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,160
You did something.

235
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,300
You fixed the shields, didn't you?

236
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,700
My powers are fading.

237
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,740
You guys would...

238
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,110
So soon?

239
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,890
So soon!

240
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,990
Get smooched, ghost!

241
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:19,990
Get smooched!

242
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,190
Get smooched!

243
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,050
You're trying to mock me, aren't you?

244
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,770
Next time the shields fail, you'll pay for this.

245
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,170
Paranormal warning.

246
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,530
Word from your boss.

247
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,390
Ghosts feed on human emotions.

248
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,670
They want your pain, anger and fear.

249
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,690
Without the shield generators, they'd rip us to shreds.

250
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,970
I'm highly in support of ghost kissing.

251
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,330
We're kissing!

252
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,410
We're gonna get mono!

253
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,550
Zamora 2.

254
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:05,870
OK.

255
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,670
Tunnel runner, your shift begins.

256
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:08,990
OK.

257
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,670
Oh, golly.

258
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,010
OK.

259
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,790
This guy.

260
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,250
OK.

261
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,390
Fixed.

262
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,020
Good to know.

263
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,100
Oh, my gosh.

264
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,640
Oh, gosh.

265
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:32,840
No, no!

266
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:40,560
I just barely managed to avoid... Wait, I already saw what I needed.

267
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,360
Oh, my gosh.

268
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,700
I'm gonna... I'm gonna... What do you need?

269
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,740
I think I... Please, let me... Let me... Crap!

270
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,260
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

271
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,820
Get smooched, get smooched, get smooched.

272
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
Hard mode unlocks more images in the gallery.

273
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,820
Really?

274
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,960
Aren't you tired of all this running?

275
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,880
You know I will catch you eventually.

276
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,500
What is this?

277
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,900
Are those pies filled with pudding?

278
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm trying to be menacing and cool and you're ruining it.

279
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,320
You know that, right?

280
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,320
Ghost is weak to pudding pie.

281
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,900
Out of the 9 new girls we got yesterday, you're the only one still alive.

282
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,700
Keep up the good work.

283
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,680
Cut wire.

284
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,060
Oh, no.

285
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,900
She's already looking like my type.

286
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,560
A little crazy.

287
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,300
OK.

288
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
Is there like any... What is this?

289
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,140
This?

290
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,200
What did I... What is... Oh, I take it.

291
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,140
I understand, I understand.

292
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:22,980
We learn.

293
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,240
We listen and we don't judge.

294
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,820
She's so cute!

295
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,800
She's so cute!

296
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,900
I like... Wait, they have the Awaria hats.

297
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,280
Do you think they're like ghosts of the people that...

298
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,440
People that died, I think.

299
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,140
Oh my goodness.

300
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,380
Wait, did I not put it in?

301
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,900
There we go.

302
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,460
Oh my gosh.

303
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,060
Wait, I need to go there!

304
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,400
You!

305
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,760
No!

306
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,300
Please...

307
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,540
It's gonna... It's gonna... I'm gonna... It's gonna... Please!

308
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,240
Wait!

309
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,660
Wait, what did I get wrong?

310
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
I'm confused.

311
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,300
Wait, what did I get wrong?

312
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Didn't I grab it?

313
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,620
Wrong item?

314
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,240
There's more than one?

315
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,110
How is there more than one item?

316
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,350
It wanted the... It's an uncharged one.

317
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,810
So there's a difference.

318
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,770
Oh my gosh.

319
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,890
OK, so this is uncharged?

320
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,770
I see, I see, I see.

321
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,990
I see, I see, I see, I see.

322
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,250
Understandable.

323
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,270
Understand, understand.

324
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,590
Oh my god.

325
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,600
Only level 2.

326
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,340
It's only level 2.

327
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,740
Oh no.

328
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,980
Give me.

329
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,860
That's OK though.

330
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,840
We're doing our best.

331
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,840
Oh my gosh.

332
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,500
What do you need?

333
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,160
Regular.

334
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,260
Regular.

335
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,100
This thing.

336
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,200
This damn thing.

337
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,760
OK, there you go.

338
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,720
Oh my god.

339
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,160
Wait, this one is broken too?

340
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,360
Oh my god.

341
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,440
Charged.

342
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,520
Oh, they're both charged.

343
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,640
Oh my god, please.

344
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,600
Please.

345
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,140
Oh, I should have fixed the other one first.

346
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,660
I'm an idiot.

347
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,540
Oh no.

348
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,580
Oh no.

349
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,860
Oh

350
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,610
my god.

351
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,530
They die so fast.

352
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,850
OK, put you in there.

353
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,790
Goodness gracious.

354
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,010
Give me a break.

355
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,060
What do you need?

356
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,140
What do you need?

357
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,490
I gotta... I gotta focus.

358
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,550
Just regular.

359
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,110
Charged.

360
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,190
Ouch!

361
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,250
You... Oh my god.

362
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:07,790
What?

363
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,790
I only got caught twice.

364
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,290
I only got caught twice.

365
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,410
Are you kidding me?

366
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:14,570
What do you need?

367
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,710
This is not easy mode.

368
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,710
This is normal mode.

369
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,090
I don't play on easy mode.

370
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:24,930
What are you talking about?

371
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,170
I have to, like, bait her into... you know.

372
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,850
Oh my gosh.

373
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,730
Oh god!

374
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,210
Try to move!

375
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,230
Oh my god.

376
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,250
Oh my god.

377
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,420
Oh my god!

378
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,420
This game already scares me.

379
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,380
This is only level 2.

380
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,780
This is insanity.

381
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,760
And here she comes.

382
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,750
Oh my god.

383
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:27,870
Oh my god.

384
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,600
I wonder if this would be easier on controller.

385
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,420
Not gonna lie.

386
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,250
I think this might be easier on controller.

387
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,070
Because...

388
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,690
My fingers don't move.

389
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,990
Unless... Can you play WASDA?

390
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:16,910
Oh, you can!

391
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,870
Okay, nevermind.

392
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,110
Because I'm... Okay, I was playing with, like, the arrow keys.

393
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,470
And going from the arrow keys to enter was, like, so difficult for me.

394
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:33,940
Why?

395
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,020
It's because I was playing...

396
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,600
I was playing something else earlier that doesn't let you play with WASDA.

397
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,620
It only lets you play with the arrow keys.

398
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,520
And so I was used to it from earlier.

399
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,600
Okay, okay.

400
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,200
So I was already, like, in the mode.

401
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
The arrow key mode.

402
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,120
Okay.

403
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:02,860
Alright.

404
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,020
Alright.

405
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,420
Oh, I always forget to put this in.

406
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,340
You know?

407
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,500
Okay.

408
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,180
It's always normal, the second one.

409
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,240
Alright, now we're gaming.

410
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,020
I say.

411
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,340
I lied.

412
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,480
I lied.

413
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,040
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

414
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,160
Oh

415
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,180
my god.

416
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,540
Okay.

417
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,700
Oh, I did it again.

418
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
I do it every time.

419
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,340
I'll learn my lesson someday.

420
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,480
Oh gosh.

421
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,530
I tried to bait it, but I went too far.

422
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,370
Oh shi...

423
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,150
Oh my god.

424
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,790
I think this is harder than Touhou.

425
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,110
I'm not gonna lie.

426
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,590
I think this is harder than Touhou.

427
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,150
Can I grab more than one?

428
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:48,850
Oh, I can.

429
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,670
Okay, that's kinda nice to know.

430
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,930
Come on.

431
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,700
Sure.

432
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,440
Oh no, no, no, no.

433
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,200
Please be...

434
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,970
Please.

435
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,410
This is so not forgiving with the...

436
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,910
With your life.

437
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,330
Please.

438
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,470
Please.

439
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,130
Oh my god.

440
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,830
Oh my god.

441
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,410
Yippee!

442
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,410
Oh my gosh.

443
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,890
Cut wire one.

444
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,290
Finished so soon and here I was having so much fun.

445
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,890
I'm ready to kiss!

446
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,300
Ah, you liked it too, didn't you?

447
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,520
My kiss has been secured.

448
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,660
Yippee!

449
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,480
We're kissing, we're kissing.

450
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,740
Whoa.

451
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,520
Oh wait, this is the thumbnail.

452
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,680
Don't worry, I'll always be there.

453
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,980
In the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to stab you in the back.

454
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,620
Awaria means malfunction in Polish.

455
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,080
Interesting.

456
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,850
Cut wire two.

457
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,890
You'll never believe it, little pup.

458
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,410
They just refilled our...

459
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,690
Denaturat.

460
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,970
Supply.

461
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,630
This is going to be a fun week.

462
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,870
Denaturat.

463
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,690
Denaturat.

464
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,550
Denaturat.

465
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,150
Is it a rat poison?

466
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,710
It's pure alcohol.

467
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,790
Ghost repeller?

468
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,730
It's...

469
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,450
Denatur...

470
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,850
Denatur...

471
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,010
Denatur...

472
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,390
Denatur...

473
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:23,890
Alcohol.

474
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,730
For them ghosts with them dentures.

475
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,750
You know what I also like?

476
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,890
Is that each chapter you can play, you can change the mode.

477
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,210
It's kind of nice.

478
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,490
Your drone will save you from death on a ten second cooldown.

479
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,590
Here we go.

480
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,310
Okay, so soon.

481
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,410
Alright.

482
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,530
What do you need?

483
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,870
Regular, got you.

484
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,110
Cut wire two.

485
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,470
She's so cute.

486
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,700
Okay.

487
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,120
Oh, okay.

488
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,620
You're just following me?

489
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,380
Okay.

490
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,340
This is so evil!

491
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,200
Oh god!

492
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,610
Oh shit.

493
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,220
First try?

494
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,060
I think I'm gaming.

495
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,080
First try, baby.

496
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,980
I'm ready to kiss.

497
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,290
Double kiss.

498
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,860
Second one we didn't get a kiss.

499
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,640
The second kiss.

500
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,630
Oh my gosh!

501
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,590
I can't believe we can kiss so many ghosts today!

502
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,390
Yeah!

503
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,110
Look how cute they are!

504
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:23,390
See, I told you she would give you a kiss if you tried to murder her.

505
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,650
Look, we even got a box of pudding pies.

506
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:31,830
We're kissing?

507
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,470
We're kissing?

508
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,490
Peek.

509
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,850
I actually have a Helltaker...

510
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,930
I have the...

511
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,990
What's it called?

512
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,110
The pop-up parade.

513
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,890
The pop-up parade figure.

514
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,710
From Helltaker.

515
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,550
I like that game.

516
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,410
It was fun.

517
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:00,530
Cerberus?

518
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,230
No, I'm pretty sure it's Lucifer.

519
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,690
Hold on, let me double check.

520
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,710
It's been a long time since I've seen their names.

521
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,890
Sorry if you heard TikTok.

522
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,070
TikTok.

523
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,090
Lucifer pop-up parade.

524
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

525
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,010
Lucifer.

526
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,710
Kiss himself!

527
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,150
Thanks for the time gifted!

528
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,390
Thank you!

529
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,650
Thank you, thank you.

530
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,710
Alexis, happy birthday!

531
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,490
Happy birthday to you!

532
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,590
Happy birthday to you!

533
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,630
Happy birthday, dear Alexis!

534
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,590
Happy birthday to you!

535
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,850
Happy birthday!

536
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,670
Nikita.

537
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:52,770
Nikita.

538
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,170
Most of the ghosts used to be tunnel runners, just like you.

539
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,630
I called it!

540
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,130
Remember I said earlier, I was like, I wonder if they're former...

541
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,730
Because they're wearing the hats, I was like, I wonder if they're former workers.

542
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,550
Unfortunately, death took away their memories.

543
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,390
We're late!

544
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,210
Thanks for the time gifted!

545
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,990
Have you pre-ordered the Figma Solid Snake?

546
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,630
I have!

547
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,210
I have, I have, I have.

548
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,510
Why does she look like the Fury?

549
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,270
I'm scared.

550
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,350
The animation is so cute.

551
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,710
Oh gosh, it's this again.

552
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,790
Oh, now we have to combine everything?

553
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,690
Oh god, okay.

554
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,150
Holy moly.

555
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,810
Low tier smelter.

556
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,190
She's coming for me!

557
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,800
Oh, no, no, no, no!

558
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,800
Wait, watch it!

559
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,460
Leave me alone!

560
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,740
I can't check it right now though!

561
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,060
This is what I need.

562
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,540
Ouchie, ouchie.

563
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,520
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

564
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,260
Nice dodge, nice dodge.

565
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,280
I

566
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,650
tried to get it!

567
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,110
There we go.

568
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,250
Another

569
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,540
year passes from my birth into a blizzard at the beach.

570
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,280
I feel I've reached the age where it's all a little bit downhill from here.

571
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,860
Downhill is good!

572
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,220
But that's just how it is, so I just want to say thank you for being the special kind of weird and goofy that brings joy to it all.

573
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,800
Downhill is where it's gonna go fast!

574
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,340
And fun!

575
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,720
That's why downhill is the best part of the rollercoaster.

576
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,160
Happy birthday to you!

577
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,640
Happy birthday to you!

578
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,580
Happy birthday dear the villain!

579
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,600
Happy birthday to you!

580
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,440
Happy birthday!

581
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:22,900
And Elsa!

582
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,360
Thank you for the ping!

583
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,960
Ghost girl keeps squealing.

584
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,540
We love it.

585
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,900
I'm squealing like a pig.

586
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,060
That's some pig.

587
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,300
Looks like mommy's out of juice.

588
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,460
How embarrassing.

589
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,140
Are you guys ready to kiss?

590
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,430
Ready!

591
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,130
To kiss!

592
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,090
Smooching time!

593
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,920
It's better than what I could have imagined.

594
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,350
You're a tiny one, aren't you?

595
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,830
I swear I could eat you in a single bite.

596
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,260
What are you doing?

597
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,320
I'm supposed to doodle here!

598
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,840
To give you my combined birthday and Christmas wish.

599
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,260
To keep the spirit.

600
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,460
I have a spirit!

601
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,020
Being the best you, always.

602
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,320
Thank you for coming back and promise to never die.

603
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,400
Oh, it's a Team America joke.

604
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,920
To fill up character count.

605
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,400
Merry early Christmas.

606
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,640
Merry Christmas!

607
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,420
I feel bad though.

608
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,380
Your birthday is so close to Christmas.

609
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,580
Did you have to have a combined Christmas birthday?

610
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,280
When you were a kid?

611
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,280
Did you have all your presents in the same time?

612
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,540
I always felt bad for people like that.

613
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,680
Because usually you expect to get more presents because they are all at the same time.

614
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,380
But they just never consider that.

615
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:21,920
Spank!

616
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,860
Thanks for the 20k!

617
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,360
I'm dead!

618
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,760
Thank you so much!

619
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,640
My birthday is the 24th?

620
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,620
No way.

621
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,340
I got to sing you a happy birthday on my favorite.

622
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,160
It sounds even more special that way.

623
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,560
I don't know.

624
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,480
It was okay for me?

625
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,700
That's good.

626
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,560
My birthday is exactly halfway through the year.

627
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,040
Optimal birthday Christmas separation.

628
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,140
But what if Christmas in July?

629
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,060
What if?

630
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,600
You know?

631
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,920
Having a birthday on the 18th got them put together?

632
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,000
Even the 18th?

633
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I feel... Honestly, I feel anybody with a birthday in December kind of gets... kind of gets...

634
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Shafted, you know?

635
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,680
So I'm really sorry.

636
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,740
But I prefer my food properly baked.

637
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,340
Come visit me in the kitchen when the shield's down, okay?

638
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,380
Why do they just expect the shield's gonna be down?

639
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,780
Nikita too.

640
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,180
Our boss is eating the pudding pies.

641
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,640
Thanks for the pudding pies, pup.

642
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,980
Where did you get these?

643
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,340
Is your mom working in the VIP warehouse or something?

644
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,400
Why are there so many ghosts in here?

645
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,740
I have so many questions.

646
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,600
Dang, no kiss.

647
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,540
But here we'll get the kiss for sure.

648
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,580
The kiss of death.

649
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,580
Look!

650
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,700
We have the step stool!

651
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,640
We're getting the kiss.

652
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,280
We're getting the kiss.

653
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,860
Kiss motivation activated.

654
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,260
Oh, wow, that was really fast.

655
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,720
That was... Oh, okay.

656
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,140
Got it.

657
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,170
Oh, the gear.

658
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,510
Oh my gosh, metal gear.

659
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,530
Oh my god, both are metal gear.

660
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Ah, shit.

661
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,660
Oh my god, wait, it has to activate?

662
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,260
Oh my god.

663
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,960
Wait, I'm not doing so well, you guys.

664
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,740
I'm not doing...

665
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,820
Okay, redo.

666
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,640
Oh, this one already died.

667
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,020
Okay.

668
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,820
Okay, we fix.

669
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,080
This one is this guy.

670
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,560
Oh gosh.

671
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,920
What do you need?

672
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,680
Metal gear.

673
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,140
Branzini!

674
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,720
Thank you so much for the tiny gift.

675
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,880
Thank you.

676
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,420
Okay, grab this first.

677
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,460
Grab this.

678
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,440
Grab this.

679
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,840
Grab...do that.

680
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,620
Okay, metal gear.

681
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,240
Metal gear?

682
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,040
Metal gear.

683
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,920
I grabbed the metal gear.

684
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,740
What happened to the metal gear?

685
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,420
What happened to the metal gear?

686
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,200
Why did it disappear?

687
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,300
Metal gear.

688
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,450
This is a metal gear again.

689
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:37,810
And metal gear.

690
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,190
Maybe I did that.

691
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,710
Oh, I forget to always activate it, reactivate it.

692
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:41,890
Okay.

693
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,350
Oh my goodness.

694
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,590
Okay, metal gear.

695
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,630
Metal gear is loading.

696
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,330
Metal gear is loading.

697
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:46,850
Metal gear.

698
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,210
Metal gear fix.

699
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:49,970
Metal gear loading.

700
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:52,550
This is down.

701
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,370
What do you need?

702
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:54,410
Metal gear.

703
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,990
Why does everything need metal gear?

704
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:56,570
What do you mean?

705
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,790
Oh my god.

706
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:03,690
Fixed.

707
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,180
I ran right into it.

708
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,580
What do you need?

709
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,440
Metal gear.

710
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,520
Grab metal gear.

711
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,100
Oh my god.

712
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,280
Come on.

713
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,600
That was so cheap.

714
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,760
What do you need?

715
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,600
This thing.

716
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
Do you need a metal gear?

717
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,300
No, you need this thing.

718
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:24,920
Oh my gosh.

719
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,340
The game is switching it up on me all of a sudden.

720
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,880
Oh, metal gear.

721
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,470
Oh, the other one is closer.

722
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,050
Wait, please.

723
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,090
I have it.

724
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,670
Wait, do you need metal gear now?

725
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,370
Oh, it needs a metal...

726
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,550
I'm not noticing when I'm fixing it.

727
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,030
I'm not noticing when I'm fixing it.

728
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,130
Oh my god.

729
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,390
Metal gear.

730
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,280
Rude.

731
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,480
So rude.

732
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,580
So rude.

733
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,260
So rude.

734
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,740
So rude.

735
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,180
So rude.

736
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,620
So rude.

737
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,040
So rude.

738
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,500
So rude.

739
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:19,960
So rude.

740
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,640
Does it need two things sometimes or am I crazy?

741
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,460
Metal gear.

742
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:28,540
Metal gear.

743
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,950
Wait, what is this?

744
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,790
Am I not holding one?

745
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,530
Am I crazy?

746
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:38,670
I'm crazy.

747
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,070
Crazy.

748
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,950
These machines are terrible.

749
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,050
Oh my god.

750
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:45,930
What's blowing up?

751
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,590
Oh, that is...

752
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,770
The thing that needs to be fixed.

753
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,750
I'm an idiot.

754
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,410
Oh god.

755
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,630
You guys, I'm regressing.

756
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:08,310
I did so well with the other ones and now I'm regressing.

757
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,210
What the...

758
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,510
That's what I mean though.

759
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,490
Does it...

760
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,150
Just a regular.

761
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:19,250
Fixed.

762
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,990
Metal gear.

763
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,450
What do you need?

764
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:24,970
That.

765
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,810
OK, I got you.

766
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,330
What do you need?

767
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:28,530
A regular.

768
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:29,830
Got you.

769
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,310
Oh.

770
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,490
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

771
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,180
They do need two sometimes.

772
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,700
Sorry, if you guys are... You're probably yelling in the chat like...

773
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,160
VTuber!

774
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,840
Of course it needs two!

775
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,580
Just look at the picture!

776
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,900
But I'm too busy gaming.

777
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,500
I'm too busy thinking about kisses.

778
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,540
I wasn't mentally prepared for a Metal Gear stream today.

779
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,600
Hey, what's the ladder for?

780
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,200
Ready to kiss.

781
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,540
It's so funny, there's actually an idol group called Ready to Kiss.

782
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,080
I don't really like their music so much though.

783
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,440
I have to like an idol group's music to like them.

784
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,960
Even though they have some of the cutest girls.

785
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,100
So if you look up Ready to Kiss, you'll find the idol group.

786
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,840
They're really cute.

787
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,900
But their music is so...

788
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,540
It's so generic.

789
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,720
It's so... I was like...

790
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,440
There's a couple of songs that I really like.

791
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,320
Like Tai Ni Ikitai.

792
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,340
I was gonna ask some recommended songs.

793
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,020
That one's cute.

794
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,300
Tai... Ni Ikitai.

795
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,120
And it's a cute pun.

796
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,420
OK, are you guys ready to kiss?

797
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,100
Let's kiss!

798
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,550
Oh stop it, you tease.

799
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:14,790
You know I can't do fire when the shields are up.

800
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,330
We got our kiss!

801
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,690
Kiss secured.

802
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,620
I'm sure you'd catch it nicely though.

803
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,180
Let's find a working furnace and mommy will...

804
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,620
Will cook you properly.

805
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,050
Everybody's gonna be putting in their job applications to Awaria.

806
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,110
Or is it Awaria?

807
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,170
What's the pronunciation?

808
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,850
If it's Polish.

809
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,430
Or is it something completely different from what I'm saying?

810
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:01,410
Awaria.

811
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,150
Awaria.

812
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,410
Awaria or Awaria?

813
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:14,940
Awaria.

814
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:15,480
OK.

815
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:27,920
Nice.

816
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,940
Word from your boss.

817
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,780
Zamora3!

818
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:31,960
Oh, she's back.

819
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,160
I'm sorry you've been thrown into this pit with us.

820
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,240
But I've been running the tunnels for 20 years by now.

821
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,980
And I can tell you've got talent for this job.

822
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:41,840
Me?

823
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,360
Oh

824
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,090
no, not with Wirecutter.

825
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:50,270
No.

826
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,910
And there's Electric Shocker.

827
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,070
What do you need?

828
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:11,410
That?

829
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,490
Wait, I just gave you that.

830
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,030
Did I not?

831
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,430
Did I not grab that?

832
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:18,150
Do I lose things?

833
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,150
Low tier Shocker.

834
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:22,870
Again.

835
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,630
You drop things.

836
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,390
You can only hold two things.

837
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,250
I

838
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:35,390
have pockets!

839
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,090
I must have pockets!

840
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:51,100
Oh my god, I'm just trying to get over here lady.

841
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,640
What does it mean?

842
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,420
Oh, I was already holding one.

843
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,030
Oh my god.

844
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:08,690
No!

845
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,030
That's so unfair.

846
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,250
Are you kidding me right now?

847
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,590
Are you kidding me?

848
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,770
We gamed.

849
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,600
Oh,

850
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:34,910
I just noticed the other one is down too.

851
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,470
Oh my god, two things.

852
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:42,290
Ouch!

853
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,310
Oh,

854
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:52,630
it's so tricky.

855
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,170
Holy moly.

856
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,570
So tricky.

857
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,250
Especially having these.

858
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:07,250
There she is.

859
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,590
And they're in the corners, which doesn't make it much easier.

860
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:19,880
No!

861
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:22,640
Please!

862
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:26,940
Gear.

863
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:27,860
Metal gear.

864
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,280
Oh my god.

865
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:36,920
Again!

866
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,360
You son of a bitch.

867
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:40,840
Oh my god.

868
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:46,340
Why?

869
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,380
Okay.

870
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,860
I'm wondering if I should just hold on to some stuff, but I don't want to drop things.

871
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:00,540
See?

872
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,080
Now I have to drop that.

873
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,200
I'm gonna drop something.

874
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,180
You have to get so up close to it, you know?

875
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,160
Again!

876
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:11,980
Okay.

877
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,180
The time limits I've noticed are longer though.

878
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,020
Oh shit.

879
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,160
We lead them to one side, then we...

880
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,520
Fix.

881
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,780
Oh my god, so...

882
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,740
Oh, this is so rough.

883
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:46,130
This one's tricky, tricky.

884
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,190
Oh nice.

885
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:50,190
That was lucky.

886
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:51,730
That was so lucky.

887
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:07,170
I was the only way I could get out.

888
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:09,530
I was the only way I could get out.

889
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:14,780
Gear.

890
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,000
Metal gear.

891
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,100
Gear.

892
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,600
That was close.

893
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,540
Gear, metal gear.

894
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,660
I love when metal gear...

895
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,600
Oh, I don't love when I don't do it again though.

896
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,200
Okay.

897
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,770
Oh my god.

898
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,810
I have to bait it?

899
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,210
No, no!

900
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:07,970
Why?

901
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:20,410
I love cheese as much as the next person, but...

902
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:25,090
I don't know if I would love it enough to steal it.

903
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,500
Come on.

904
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,720
How many do I have to fix?

905
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,280
Seven?

906
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,320
I have to fix seven of them?

907
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,580
Holy cow.

908
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,620
Oh god, I got stuck on the wall!

909
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,500
I got stuck on the wall.

910
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,220
I wish it wasn't like so...

911
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,320
Oh, I knew I was gonna get got by that.

912
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,100
I had to though.

913
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,080
I had to go in there.

914
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,720
But I could've like baited it and then left, right.

915
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:10,320
I get stuck in the... I hate that there is such in corners.

916
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,440
Otherwise, like you can't...

917
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,560
Just kind of like graze the wall for it.

918
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,540
Which kind of sucks.

919
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,680
Oh, hello.

920
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,520
I didn't notice she came in.

921
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:25,920
Hello?

922
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,800
Fix.

923
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,600
Get fixed.

924
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,120
Get fixed.

925
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:33,640
Get fixed.

926
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:33,880
Ok.

927
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:34,620
And break.

928
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:38,860
You...

929
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,480
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

930
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:43,860
Ouch.

931
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,420
I'm surprised that didn't get me.

932
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,360
I'm not gonna lie.

933
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,660
I'm surprised that didn't get me.

934
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,960
Oh, it's already down again.

935
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,030
Stop following me!

936
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,090
Come on, man.

937
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:14,050
How am I supposed to fix it otherwise?

938
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:17,210
If I'm not standing up against it.

939
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,150
And then you stand there.

940
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,710
Like the...

941
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,670
Like the unfair player.

942
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:29,510
That you are!

943
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,450
Wait, why did I grab that?

944
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,050
I don't know.

945
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,530
Hopefully it's for this.

946
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:36,230
No, but the Metal Gear!

947
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:41,430
I

948
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,560
don't know how I'm gonna... You guys, I don't know.

949
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,140
I don't know.

950
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,920
Metal Gear or... Wait, I have that thing.

951
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,840
I'm holding on to it right now, literally.

952
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,600
Stop posting these things!

953
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,680
There's so many of them!

954
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:57,640
These!

955
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:58,860
Stop!

956
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,360
Come on!

957
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,120
At least it's one of these.

958
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:17,800
One of these.

959
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,360
Oh my gosh.

960
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,040
Oh my gosh.

961
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:29,740
Juked!

962
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,540
I don't know how I juked it, but I did!

963
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,210
Oh my god, there's no way.

964
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,270
Unless I'm super lucky.

965
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,510
Oh, and I didn't press it again.

966
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:54,600
Nice!

967
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,260
This is only easy mode.

968
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:58,820
Oh, not easy.

969
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,060
Sorry, this is normal mode.

970
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,720
How is... I can't imagine how hard hard mode is.

971
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,960
Do you think they'll kiss me?

972
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,600
Like one on each cheek?

973
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,680
It's all your fault, you wordless piece of shit!

974
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,900
You are only the second most annoying idiot I know.

975
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,960
I'm ready to kiss them both.

976
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,020
I'm ready to grow two mouths.

977
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,080
I

978
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,880
called it!

979
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,490
Me too, me too.

980
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:42,930
Me too, me too.

981
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:43,210
Sorry.

982
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:46,210
Yeah.

983
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:58,030
Okay, sorry.

984
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:58,550
Anyway.

985
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,430
Sorry.

986
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,470
Sorry.

987
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,390
I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

988
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,730
I'm going to the little ghosties room.

989
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:08,790
In a moment.

990
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:12,410
One moment.

991
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:13,290
I just gotta pee.

992
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:48,670
Sorry.

993
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:50,130
I'm back, I'm back.

994
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,770
Hold on one second.

995
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:58,330
I have to check something on my phone real quick.

996
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,510
I have to check something on my phone real quick.

997
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:04,870
I'm checking, I'm checking.

998
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:06,510
I'm checking, I'm checking.

999
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,610
She's back.

1000
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,030
I'm back, baby.

1001
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,690
I'm back, baby.

1002
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,130
What the... What the heck?

1003
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,760
How are you?

1004
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,560
What are you saying?

1005
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,430
Why are you guys... Why are you...

1006
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,180
Can't wait for all the freaky artwork.

1007
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,080
What are you saying?

1008
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,060
Thanks Mint.

1009
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,880
Oh my god, please.

1010
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,980
I've changed my mind.

1011
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,020
You are both equally infuriating.

1012
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,400
High five!

1013
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,120
Nice.

1014
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,200
Word from your boss.

1015
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,200
Zamora 4!

1016
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,940
Stay away from the lower levels, pup.

1017
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,820
Shields barely do anything down there.

1018
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,320
Leave that stuff to the veterans.

1019
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,540
Is that the hard mode?

1020
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,770
9 is where it actually gets tough.

1021
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,610
I think it's already tough.

1022
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:28,310
Right?

1023
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,090
How many levels are there?

1024
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:33,290
I'm curious.

1025
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:33,450
I'm curious.

1026
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,440
13.

1027
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,400
Oh, nice.

1028
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,460
I thought it would be less than that.

1029
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:43,960
OK, good.

1030
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,400
The lower levels are other sectors, maybe.

1031
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,120
Maybe.

1032
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,020
Stop kissing!

1033
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,020
What is going on?

1034
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,460
No, it's all sector F.

1035
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,620
Oh, what I meant was like...

1036
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,260
Hold on one second.

1037
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:15,920
Oh my gosh.

1038
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:18,120
No!

1039
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,640
Oh no!

1040
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:29,330
I was on a... I forgot.

1041
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:33,930
I was on a... I was on like a customer support chat thing.

1042
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:35,690
And I completely forgot about it.

1043
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,270
And then I just saw it being like...

1044
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:38,810
New message!

1045
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,310
New message!

1046
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:41,890
And it was like, you've been idle for too long.

1047
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,770
I hate that!

1048
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:45,770
Oh, oopsie.

1049
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:47,170
Yeah, I'm streaming.

1050
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:50,810
Is that the sound?

1051
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:53,250
That must have been the sound!

1052
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,980
I was just like, what is the sound?

1053
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,400
And it was the customer support chat!

1054
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:07,580
What?

1055
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,320
You ghosted them.

1056
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:28,760
Gosh.

1057
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,560
Where is customer support Johnson when you need him?

1058
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,640
The guy is just customer Johnson now.

1059
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,300
He gave up his life of support.

1060
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,480
Mystery solved!

1061
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,900
Good, because I was so confused what that mysterious beeping was.

1062
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,620
Now I know.

1063
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:49,820
Okay.

1064
01:01:53,600 --> 01:02:03,460
Oh, what I meant though by the sectors is I think someone was saying like, maybe like sector E, sector D, sector C, things like that.

1065
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:11,660
Maybe those are like the lower levels is what they were, like someone mentioned that, what they were referring to.

1066
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,700
Someone in chat was also saying it too.

1067
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,120
Detective Minto does it again.

1068
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,820
Ghost the customer support while playing a ghost kissing game.

1069
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,680
Make sure to leave a good survey review for their trouble.

1070
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,340
I know, right?

1071
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:35,100
They even helped me with my issue.

1072
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,520
And I just didn't have a chance to respond because I was streaming.

1073
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,140
Sorry, customer support.

1074
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,660
Okey dokey.

1075
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,360
Let's do it.

1076
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,360
Oh, what is this now?

1077
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,860
Oh, it needs this to then... Oh, interesting.

1078
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:02,260
Okay.

1079
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,500
Alright.

1080
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:07,020
And this is broken and needs this generator thingy.

1081
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,480
And you're back.

1082
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:09,840
Hello.

1083
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:12,560
Hello.

1084
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,520
Oh, I totally walked right into that.

1085
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,300
Silly me, Metal Gear.

1086
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,540
So are we gonna get... Oh, this is also Metal Gear.

1087
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,360
And I didn't update it.

1088
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,080
Oh my god.

1089
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:25,780
Oh my god.

1090
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,300
Oh my god.

1091
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:26,640
Oh my god.

1092
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:26,940
Oh my god.

1093
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,340
Oh my god.

1094
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:28,900
Oh my god.

1095
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,100
Oh, please.

1096
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,180
Please.

1097
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:44,120
Oh my gosh.

1098
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,160
Why?

1099
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:46,420
What?

1100
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,240
There's two of them?

1101
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,280
This is messed up.

1102
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,240
This is so messed up.

1103
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,660
Please, can I... Can I... I'm coming through.

1104
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,010
I think something needed Metal Gear.

1105
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,250
Oh, this needed Metal Gear.

1106
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,550
And then... Oh no, no, no, no.

1107
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,010
This one's about to explode.

1108
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:28,850
Uh-oh.

1109
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,650
It only showed one picture.

1110
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,190
I thought it was good with one thing.

1111
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,570
Oh, we're so boned.

1112
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:34,830
That's it, everybody.

1113
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,010
Sayonara.

1114
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:37,910
Sayonara!

1115
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,850
We almost had it.

1116
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:45,950
We were so close.

1117
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,090
We almost had it.

1118
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,570
But I got the idea of it now.

1119
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:58,850
So, not so bad, I suppose.

1120
01:04:58,850 --> 01:04:59,270
I suppose.

1121
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:07,730
It's good to maybe carry this around.

1122
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:08,130
Oh, wait.

1123
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:12,350
Oh, ouch.

1124
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:13,350
I did not notice that.

1125
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,270
I'm so dumb.

1126
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,430
I tried moving.

1127
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:20,650
I'm stupid.

1128
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:20,750
I'm stupid.

1129
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:34,670
OK, there we go.

1130
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,790
We'll wait for my drone to come back, you know.

1131
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:39,750
There we go.

1132
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:40,970
Okey-dokey.

1133
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:42,990
Nice.

1134
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:44,470
OK.

1135
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:45,310
Oh, wait.

1136
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:45,770
Where's my drone?

1137
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:46,510
Oh, there's my drone.

1138
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,170
My little drone man.

1139
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,670
OK.

1140
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:52,130
That's easy enough.

1141
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,170
That's easy enough.

1142
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:56,710
Come on.

1143
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,080
Drone MVP.

1144
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,620
I'm guessing...

1145
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,240
It's this again.

1146
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,700
It's just a sneaking suspicion.

1147
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:14,880
Yes.

1148
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,380
Hello, ma'am.

1149
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,180
Metal gear.

1150
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,680
Goodbye.

1151
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,640
We did so good in the first round.

1152
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,400
We did so good.

1153
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:33,200
No!

1154
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,840
I need to get through.

1155
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,860
Oh, it's this one now.

1156
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:48,540
Interesting.

1157
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:49,880
Is it gonna be this?

1158
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:51,820
Yep.

1159
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:00,230
Oh yeah.

1160
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:10,320
You never realize how long 10 seconds is until games like this.

1161
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:10,920
You know what I mean?

1162
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:20,860
You never realize how long 10 seconds can be until a game like this.

1163
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,160
Oh my gosh, please.

1164
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:22,840
Let me through.

1165
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:23,720
Let me through.

1166
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:38,470
Oh, I needed a gear too?

1167
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:40,490
Oh my gosh.

1168
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:45,390
Shit.

1169
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:50,230
That was greedy.

1170
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:51,710
That was greedy.

1171
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:54,450
That was greedy there.

1172
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:57,110
They were juking.

1173
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:58,010
I was trying.

1174
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:03,850
Hello.

1175
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:04,030
Hello.

1176
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:05,530
Hello.

1177
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,070
Hello.

1178
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,750
Oh god.

1179
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:09,050
Okay.

1180
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:16,890
And a gear.

1181
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:17,530
Metal gear.

1182
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:19,410
Hello.

1183
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,050
I wish it would show two pictures.

1184
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:27,590
If I had two things to be repaired.

1185
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:28,790
Shit.

1186
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:40,030
It does?

1187
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:45,710
But there was one time when I was going to it and it only showed one.

1188
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:47,890
And then two popped up.

1189
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:58,920
No?

1190
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,900
I swear.

1191
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,120
Why would I make that up?

1192
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,520
I'm so... I got stuck on the wall.

1193
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,400
I got stuck on the wall.

1194
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,140
One guy.

1195
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,520
That was my own eyes.

1196
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,200
That was my own eyes.

1197
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,080
Already?

1198
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,220
Wow.

1199
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,000
Okay.

1200
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:36,600
Greedy.

1201
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:42,870
Shoot you.

1202
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:44,590
Shoot you.

1203
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:46,330
Oh my gosh.

1204
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,930
I hate.

1205
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:54,990
I hate these damn little things.

1206
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,830
How is it getting more difficult than this?

1207
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:00,810
How?

1208
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:02,250
How?

1209
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,110
Oh my god.

1210
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,170
Girl has two left eyes.

1211
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,010
Clearly.

1212
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:19,670
What?

1213
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:19,990
Hello?

1214
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:20,850
Fix it.

1215
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:21,510
There we go.

1216
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:24,990
Oh, I had to unlock what the problem was first.

1217
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:26,870
Oh, again?

1218
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:28,230
You.

1219
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,540
Out of my way.

1220
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,080
Leave me alone.

1221
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:44,740
Oh shit.

1222
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,260
There we go.

1223
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:45,580
Okay.

1224
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:49,740
Okay.

1225
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,700
Not being greedy.

1226
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,540
I'm not being greedy.

1227
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,360
I'm not being greedy.

1228
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,100
Get it on the way over there.

1229
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:01,860
And what's this?

1230
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,640
Oh my god.

1231
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,600
That was so close.

1232
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:16,590
Oh shit.

1233
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,030
I forgot to do the metal gear.

1234
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:22,560
Activate.

1235
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,180
Thank you.

1236
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:39,820
Oh please.

1237
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:40,400
Come on.

1238
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:41,360
You can't be serious.

1239
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,360
She is supposed to be the deadliest ghost in the sector.

1240
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,560
What a joke.

1241
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,020
Smug.

1242
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:53,940
That's me.

1243
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,620
The deadliest ghost in the sector.

1244
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,100
Obviously.

1245
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,240
Duh.

1246
01:11:58,900 --> 01:11:59,220
Obviously.

1247
01:11:59,440 --> 01:11:59,600
Sorry.

1248
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,760
Every time I click out of the game, the music stops.

1249
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,260
It's one of those types of games.

1250
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,020
Am I blocking too much, by the way?

1251
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:06,820
I just realized.

1252
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,180
Am I blocking a lot of the game?

1253
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,660
You can just tell me to move.

1254
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,080
Just be like, hey Minto, I can't see the screen.

1255
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,230
It's not really a good place for me to go to.

1256
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:25,470
A bit, but that can't be helped.

1257
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,210
We tried to tell you at first, but gave up.

1258
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,710
Sorry.

1259
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:35,570
I couldn't see.

1260
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:39,270
Try to tell me things when I'm not playing the game.

1261
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:39,850
You know what I mean?

1262
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:43,070
Because otherwise I'm not going to see it at all.

1263
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,800
Your mod DM... I don't even have Discord open.

1264
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:54,920
Hold on, I'll do this.

1265
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:01,240
Yeah, tell me things... Tell me things when I'm not playing.

1266
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:04,620
Otherwise I'm never going to see it.

1267
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:15,710
This should be good.

1268
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:18,930
But you're MintoGaming.

1269
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:20,530
I am MintoGaming.

1270
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,930
I'm always gaming.

1271
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:23,590
I got that gamer brain.

1272
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:25,170
I got that gamer mind.

1273
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,630
The gamer mind... Oh, ready to kiss!

1274
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:28,930
Are you ready guys?

1275
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:31,390
Get ready.

1276
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:35,610
Get ready to kiss.

1277
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:38,390
Oh!

1278
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:38,870
Error.

1279
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:40,990
You think this is funny, do you?

1280
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:42,090
I'm trying to kill you.

1281
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:43,050
Didn't you notice that?

1282
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,410
Why are you always like this?

1283
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:49,570
Why can't you just take things seriously for once?

1284
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:52,230
What's that supposed to mean?

1285
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:52,970
What is this backstory?

1286
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:54,030
You know what?

1287
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:54,510
I give up.

1288
01:13:54,790 --> 01:14:00,230
If this is all just a joke I might at least... I might at least be the last one laughing.

1289
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:10,430
Zamora5.

1290
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:12,830
Word from your boss.

1291
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:15,510
Hey, I've heard you actually volunteer for the tunnels.

1292
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:16,690
Is that true?

1293
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:16,770
Is that true?

1294
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:19,990
So no kiss?

1295
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,480
Here we go.

1296
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:34,210
Oh, shut up.

1297
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:35,930
This is terrible.

1298
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:39,590
This is the... Oh my god, no.

1299
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:41,270
No!

1300
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:44,810
Oh no!

1301
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,720
Oh my god.

1302
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,260
Is it... It's just her though, right?

1303
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,060
She's already complaining.

1304
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,420
Yeah, because I can see how hellish this is.

1305
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:06,750
Zamora.

1306
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:08,490
High tier shocker.

1307
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:10,030
Oh, hello.

1308
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:11,770
Oh my god.

1309
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:12,910
Oh my god.

1310
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:13,570
Oh my god.

1311
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:14,270
Oh my god.

1312
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:15,070
Oh my god.

1313
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:15,670
Oh my god.

1314
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:22,100
That could be worse maybe.

1315
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,940
Okay, nevermind.

1316
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,390
Oh my god.

1317
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:39,930
There's just electricity everywhere.

1318
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:43,530
There's just electricity everywhere.

1319
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:45,190
Please.

1320
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:46,110
Please.

1321
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:48,750
Is anything broken?

1322
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:49,770
Oh, I see it over there.

1323
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:50,670
Two of them.

1324
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,890
This game kind of sucks maybe.

1325
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:57,430
Oh, wrong.

1326
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:59,670
No, I got the wrong...

1327
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:09,770
Oh my god.

1328
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,820
This sucks.

1329
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,220
This is terrible.

1330
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,180
This game sucks.

1331
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:22,400
This game sucks.

1332
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,480
This game sucks.

1333
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:24,200
I changed my mind.

1334
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:25,520
I don't like this game anymore.

1335
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,520
Oh god.

1336
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,770
Oh my god.

1337
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:42,450
Just a simple little water briefcase.

1338
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:43,890
Oh, here she comes.

1339
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:50,690
Oh, come on.

1340
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:51,550
Come on.

1341
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:08,670
Oh shit.

1342
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:28,480
Locked in.

1343
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,140
Think of the kisses.

1344
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:30,800
Hello?

1345
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,220
Oh, okay.

1346
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,040
I think I have to move.

1347
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:35,840
Water.

1348
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,000
I don't know if it's water.

1349
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,000
I just think of it as a water briefcase.

1350
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,320
What?

1351
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,620
I was just trying to get out of the way.

1352
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:58,000
Didn't give me a single chance to move at all.

1353
01:17:58,740 --> 01:17:59,620
It's craziness.

1354
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,920
Alright, I'm just gonna keep running around.

1355
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:06,380
Oh, I think...

1356
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,020
Why did it have to be this?

1357
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,140
Should be fine.

1358
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:33,020
Oh, not fine.

1359
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,220
Stay away from me!

1360
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:56,050
Oh my god, that was so close.

1361
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:04,880
The cross shockwaves come in three consecutive attacks.

1362
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:05,960
Yep, I see that.

1363
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,880
It's just hard to know where she's gonna go.

1364
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:09,080
Oh.

1365
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,720
It's hard to know where she's gonna teleport to.

1366
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,440
Is the bigger issue for me.

1367
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:52,070
I'm trying to... do this.

1368
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,650
Come on!

1369
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,900
Gosh, she's so fast!

1370
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:36,700
Walking diagonals.

1371
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,100
It's easier said than done.

1372
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,860
It's a very tight spot.

1373
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,060
Like, tight space.

1374
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,840
Up here.

1375
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,100
It's kinda rare.

1376
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:51,030
Press spacebar.

1377
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,430
Oh my god!

1378
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:56,290
Yay!

1379
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:58,190
Pie!

1380
01:20:58,570 --> 01:20:59,270
Pudding pie!

1381
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,610
So fun.

1382
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:25,750
Oh my god, please.

1383
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,170
Okay, water.

1384
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,930
I need to do eight?

1385
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:32,970
Oh my gosh.

1386
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:36,610
No freaking way.

1387
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:38,570
Rude!

1388
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:41,190
Rude!

1389
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:46,030
What am I getting?

1390
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:46,690
Oh, this thing.

1391
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:50,870
And... Oh my god, that was so close.

1392
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:52,050
Gah!

1393
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:11,890
Oh, screw that.

1394
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,090
This game sucks.

1395
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:32,780
Where was it?

1396
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:33,020
Three.

1397
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:33,940
Five, six, seven, eight.

1398
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:34,940
Three more!

1399
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:42,050
So close!

1400
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:43,330
Oh, I was at six.

1401
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:45,850
Oh, I thought I was at five.

1402
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:48,110
Okay, okay.

1403
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:01,800
Oh, no, wait.

1404
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,040
I wanna... Okay, we're fine.

1405
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:03,800
Oh, no, we're not fine.

1406
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:13,170
You bitch.

1407
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:15,050
You know you really are a bitch!

1408
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:18,770
Fuck you!

1409
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,020
Wait for both to be completed.

1410
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:23,140
Alright.

1411
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,300
What one's gonna explode next?

1412
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:26,780
That one.

1413
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,220
All the way over there.

1414
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,700
How lucky for...

1415
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,600
This...

1416
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,200
I hate this game.

1417
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,320
Why do I have to work for the ghost?

1418
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,740
Why do I have to work for them?

1419
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,660
I am a ghost.

1420
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,840
Guys, you have to do this if you wanna kiss me.

1421
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,080
I'm just telling you.

1422
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,680
It's not worth it, is it?

1423
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,480
Oh shit, I forgot to double tap.

1424
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,000
Stupid as hell!

1425
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:15,710
You bitch!

1426
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:15,770
Bitch!

1427
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,600
She comes straight at me.

1428
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:39,580
Doesn't even give me a chance.

1429
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:40,640
Definitely worth it.

1430
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:46,500
I

1431
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,880
mean, we're not good, but we're good.

1432
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:00,500
I hate you.

1433
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,260
I hate you.

1434
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:04,220
Why do I have to... She's not even my type.

1435
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:07,520
Why do I have to kiss the... Why do I have to go after the girl that's not my type?

1436
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,440
So many times over again!

1437
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,980
I'm not attracted to you!

1438
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,640
But she's cute.

1439
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,060
I'm not saying she's not cute.

1440
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,640
I'm just saying she's not my type.

1441
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,540
And I only wanna put in so much effort if...

1442
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,320
If she's my type.

1443
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,760
Tsundere with glasses?

1444
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:01,660
It's not the glasses.

1445
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,920
It's the...

1446
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,400
It's the hairstyle.

1447
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,040
It's like... It's just not my type.

1448
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,900
If you want her, you work for her!

1449
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,020
Screw you!

1450
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,210
It's gonna be over here.

1451
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,890
I knew it!

1452
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:57,590
My sixth sense.

1453
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:08,730
Oh wait, what is it?

1454
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:10,530
Oh my gosh.

1455
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:13,850
Oh my gosh, I don't know how I juked that, but I think I did it.

1456
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:14,590
Somehow.

1457
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:17,650
Oopsie.

1458
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:02,090
Actually, that worked.

1459
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:04,910
But... Oh, we're in trouble.

1460
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:06,450
Oh, we're in trouble.

1461
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,150
We're in trouble, we're in trouble, we're in trouble, guys.

1462
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:12,450
Oh, grab, grab, grab!

1463
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:17,250
Somehow I did it.

1464
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:18,190
No!

1465
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:20,850
Please!

1466
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:23,050
It

1467
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:28,950
was the last one, wasn't it?

1468
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:29,830
It was

1469
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,230
the last one, wasn't it?

1470
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:37,150
No!

1471
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:40,450
OK.

1472
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,130
Sorry, I just gotta lock in.

1473
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:45,250
I just gotta lock in.

1474
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:47,510
OK, this side?

1475
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:48,830
The other side.

1476
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:50,570
I knew it.

1477
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:55,990
I was literally about to say...

1478
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:59,110
I'm feeling a little bit more confident about...

1479
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:00,670
about her patterns.

1480
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:04,190
I was reading her patterns really well last time.

1481
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,670
I think I was just getting lucky, though.

1482
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,780
I freaking knew...

1483
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:35,750
Please.

1484
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:07,960
VOD watchers, skip another hour.

1485
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:09,020
Nah.

1486
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,680
We'll get this.

1487
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:13,040
We'll get this.

1488
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:20,450
What the hell?

1489
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:22,970
It's always the other side.

1490
01:31:39,210 --> 01:31:39,930
Fuck you!

1491
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:41,870
You fucking bitch!

1492
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:42,990
Fuck you!

1493
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:45,770
Sorry for my language.

1494
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:51,090
Oh, why did... Oh yeah, this one.

1495
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:54,250
I knew it was gonna be the other side, though.

1496
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:55,910
Just

1497
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:05,930
let me fix this!

1498
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:08,610
Again?

1499
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:19,400
Oh shit, there's one over here, though.

1500
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:20,340
Oh, no.

1501
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:21,580
I wasn't paying attention.

1502
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,440
I hate you!

1503
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,760
I hate you!

1504
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,020
One explode?

1505
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,080
Shit.

1506
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,100
Shit, shit, shit.

1507
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:19,840
This is not good.

1508
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,200
OK, OK.

1509
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,160
Oh god.

1510
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,360
What are these combos?

1511
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:33,160
Why are they like the most difficult ones?

1512
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,140
Oh, no.

1513
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,080
I did not mean to do that.

1514
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:52,600
But you know what?

1515
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,060
This is fine.

1516
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,580
Please be on this side.

1517
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,040
Nevermind.

1518
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:55,700
Be on this side.

1519
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:00,500
Oh god.

1520
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:04,880
Oh my god.

1521
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:05,600
That was...

1522
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:06,760
No!

1523
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,400
Please!

1524
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:13,940
Oh

1525
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:24,790
my god.

1526
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:27,110
I keep forgetting to double tap.

1527
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:31,650
Why are they all the same thing?

1528
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:33,030
What is this?

1529
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:34,190
The game is rigged.

1530
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:36,070
The game is rigged!

1531
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:40,950
Shoot me.

1532
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:43,490
I thought I could avoid it in time.

1533
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:45,470
Oh my god.

1534
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:46,090
Oh my god.

1535
01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:46,530
Oh my...

1536
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:50,250
The game was rigged!

1537
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:51,870
The game was rigged!

1538
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:03,170
Oh wait, why did I do that?

1539
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:03,990
I'm so stupid!

1540
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:18,960
Come on!

1541
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:23,860
Oh

1542
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:36,820
my god.

1543
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:05,520
I thought...I thought I could get through it.

1544
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,420
She'll get it this try.

1545
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,640
You jinxed me!

1546
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,460
Bahamut!

1547
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,180
You jinxed me!

1548
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:26,490
You jinxed me!

1549
01:36:26,850 --> 01:36:28,590
It's gonna be this one that explodes again.

1550
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:30,330
No?

1551
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:30,990
Oh, see?

1552
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:31,690
I told you.

1553
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:34,010
I told you guys.

1554
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:39,450
Why?

1555
01:36:39,450 --> 01:36:40,110
Why me?

1556
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:45,870
Girls who just say this...Fuck you!

1557
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:46,350
Fuck you!

1558
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:46,730
Fuck you!

1559
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:47,070
Fuck you!

1560
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:47,370
Fuck you!

1561
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:47,690
Fuck you!

1562
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:48,610
Fuck you!

1563
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:51,170
I would say I hope you die, but you're already dead!

1564
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:53,890
I hope you never find love!

1565
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,110
You don't deserve my kisses!

1566
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:20,060
I hope your pillows are never cold!

1567
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:29,820
I hope you never...I will never give you any of my pudding cakes ever!

1568
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:33,880
Oh my goodness.

1569
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,680
So rare for one over here to...

1570
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:45,990
What am I?

1571
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:46,930
Which one am I?

1572
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:47,290
Oh.

1573
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,150
Oh my god.

1574
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:51,730
Oh.

1575
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:52,770
Oh my god.

1576
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,230
I'm losing it, you guys.

1577
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:56,630
I'm regressing.

1578
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:00,290
I'm regressing.

1579
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:09,490
I didn't see where she went!

1580
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:10,770
Everything was electrified!

1581
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:12,710
I couldn't tell where she went.

1582
01:38:17,170 --> 01:38:18,770
Oh shit, I forgot the double.

1583
01:38:23,050 --> 01:38:26,190
I need to...I need that, please.

1584
01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:39,950
Okay, I'm lock...I lock in.

1585
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:40,510
I lock in.

1586
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:41,230
I lock in.

1587
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:58,070
So fucked up.

1588
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:03,390
So fucked up.

1589
01:39:11,710 --> 01:39:14,470
I'm just gonna hold on to this guy for now on.

1590
01:39:14,690 --> 01:39:15,070
Oh wait.

1591
01:39:15,870 --> 01:39:16,910
Onto this guy.

1592
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:18,710
Just gonna hold on to one.

1593
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:20,390
Because those are the ones that take the longest.

1594
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:22,430
Okay.

1595
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:27,300
Really?

1596
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:42,380
Now how am I supposed to do anything if you just...if you just headbutt me immediately?

1597
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,780
How am I supposed to do anything if you just headbutt me immediately?

1598
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,300
What happened there?

1599
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,020
Oh, I gave up.

1600
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:53,580
I just gave up.

1601
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:57,600
Don't you?

1602
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,480
Don't you, if you don't feel the run, you just give up?

1603
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:04,180
Alrighty.

1604
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:08,120
Oh,

1605
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,020
I did it again.

1606
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:35,700
Oops, I did it again with my heart got lost.

1607
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:41,930
I hate you.

1608
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:42,890
I hate you.

1609
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:44,090
I hate you.

1610
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:46,250
I hate you.

1611
01:40:46,930 --> 01:40:48,170
I hate you.

1612
01:40:55,700 --> 01:41:01,320
I don't know how I avoided that, but honestly, I'm kind of grateful that I did.

1613
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:17,360
Oh shit.

1614
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,600
No, I dropped something because I'm a stupid ass.

1615
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:22,900
Wait.

1616
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:23,940
Oh, I need the battery.

1617
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:30,010
Sayonara everybody.

1618
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:33,970
I didn't notice that one was over there.

1619
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:36,250
I didn't notice that one was over there.

1620
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:44,780
You guys can, you know, be like Minto, why?

1621
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:46,140
But don't like insult me, okay?

1622
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,140
Don't insult me.

1623
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,620
You guys can be like Minto, why?

1624
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:52,400
But don't be rude.

1625
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:53,460
Don't make rude comments.

1626
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:01,640
That's all I ask.

1627
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:03,280
You can be like Minto, why?

1628
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:05,500
Don't be mean, okay?

1629
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:08,240
Minto is doing her best.

1630
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,620
I saw one.

1631
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:30,820
I knew not to go left and I did.

1632
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,860
I panicked.

1633
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:33,940
What?

1634
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,840
Two batteries?

1635
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,020
Are you kidding me?

1636
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:56,980
Oh shit.

1637
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:10,140
And it's so hard to see everything in this damn game.

1638
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:14,840
Oh, I should have put in my other guy, but I didn't.

1639
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:15,200
You?

1640
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:16,520
Ah, fuck.

1641
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:22,410
I feel like her laser beam should be a different color.

1642
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:24,150
There's too much green.

1643
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:26,670
There's too much green everywhere.

1644
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:28,510
It's hard to keep track.

1645
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:35,060
Kiss the ghost now, bitch.

1646
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:38,640
Yeah, but I like green.

1647
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,100
You know, it's so true, bestie.

1648
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:44,740
I like green too.

1649
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,060
Let's go green woman.

1650
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:48,860
Except this lady.

1651
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:49,660
I hate her.

1652
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,540
This green woman...

1653
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:57,520
I would never say a green woman sucks, but when she does that, it really makes me wonder.

1654
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,640
Do I actually like green women?

1655
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:28,620
If you love green women, maybe you should try doing this part.

1656
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,900
Wisps, take the wheel.

1657
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,880
Please, take it from me.

1658
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:40,340
I can't do this anymore.

1659
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:53,500
Oh my god, I thought she's done already the third one.

1660
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:55,760
No, I miscounted.

1661
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:58,760
You bitch!

1662
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:02,240
She's like, don't hate the player.

1663
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:05,200
Just because you can't count, dummy ghost.

1664
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,640
Dummy VTuber can't count.

1665
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,000
Dummy VTuber!

1666
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:12,180
Oh, I lived.

1667
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,020
I didn't realize my drone was back.

1668
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:30,920
Gosh, I can't believe I got to the last one at that one part and then totally blew it before.

1669
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:31,520
Seriously?

1670
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,380
Wait, how are there three things broken?

1671
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:35,660
Are you kidding me?

1672
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:36,780
No, no, no.

1673
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:37,780
This is so unfair!

1674
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:39,960
What?

1675
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,820
I couldn't even concentrate.

1676
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,480
There were three things broken.

1677
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:46,980
No way!

1678
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:50,220
What?

1679
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:53,720
Rough RNG.

1680
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:57,780
Game is rigged.

1681
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:01,140
Game is rigged.

1682
01:46:22,950 --> 01:46:23,890
Hate.

1683
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:26,590
Hate.

1684
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:29,270
Hate.

1685
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:30,670
Hate.

1686
01:46:33,150 --> 01:46:38,490
I know I can do it because I got so fast.

1687
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:39,110
That far.

1688
01:46:39,370 --> 01:46:43,190
Like, I got so... to the last one, you know?

1689
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:45,350
So I know I can do it.

1690
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:47,810
I just have to do it.

1691
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,620
Except when she does shit like that.

1692
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:00,740
Pisses me off.

1693
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:01,900
You're pissing me off, lady!

1694
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:04,320
You're not cute enough to do this!

1695
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:28,350
I went outside so my dog can potty.

1696
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:30,230
There was snow everywhere already.

1697
01:47:31,610 --> 01:47:34,890
It was his first time seeing snow and he went goblin mode.

1698
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:37,250
That's so cute!

1699
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:38,710
Alright.

1700
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:42,730
I hate you.

1701
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:56,860
I hate you.

1702
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:57,920
I hate you.

1703
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,720
I didn't even register because I got hit.

1704
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,100
You fucking bitch!

1705
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:06,500
If I fucking die again, I will become the Joker!

1706
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:18,610
And this one too.

1707
01:48:18,650 --> 01:48:19,630
Oh, we're gonna die for real.

1708
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:19,890
Wait!

1709
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:20,990
Nevermind.

1710
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:30,570
Please, sir.

1711
01:48:30,650 --> 01:48:31,530
Just some water.

1712
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:36,570
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1713
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:37,290
I can't read it though.

1714
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:38,410
Why would you send it now?

1715
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:39,350
I can't read it!

1716
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:42,110
Wait, which one broke?

1717
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:43,870
Oh god, they are both on the left side.

1718
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:46,670
Water.

1719
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:16,260
Hey Rinto, here's my birthday chat before I have to go.

1720
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:21,040
It's amazing how much you've accomplished this year, although I couldn't catch the concert in person.

1721
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:23,020
I'll be looking forward to other opportunities in the future.

1722
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:23,560
P.S.

1723
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:24,780
Don't give up kissing ghosts.

1724
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:27,220
Thank you, Vector-san!

1725
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:31,440
Happy birthday to you.

1726
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:34,680
Happy birthday to you.

1727
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,240
Happy birthday dear Vector-san.

1728
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:42,960
Happy birthday to you.

1729
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:45,720
Happy birthday!

1730
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:47,380
Thank you so much for the Akasupa!

1731
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:53,700
You're a charming person who is very peaceful to listen to, even when shouting about becoming the Joker.

1732
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:05,330
Mercurial- Mercurially!

1733
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:06,470
Is that how you say your name?

1734
01:50:06,950 --> 01:50:07,790
Thank you!

1735
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:10,350
Wait, hold on.

1736
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:11,850
I think I have this.

1737
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:12,290
Hold on.

1738
01:50:14,510 --> 01:50:15,830
Yeah, I do.

1739
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:21,850
Wait.

1740
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:24,190
I was trying to get rid of it.

1741
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:25,150
Wait, hold on.

1742
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:29,140
There we go.

1743
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:43,510
I'm not clowning around anymore, guys.

1744
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:46,570
I'm not clowning around anymore.

1745
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,880
I think I messed up.

1746
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,920
Wait, hold on.

1747
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:04,560
Let me restart.

1748
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,280
Let me restart.

1749
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:17,040
Maybe I am clowning around.

1750
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:39,170
Run diagonally, they say.

1751
01:51:39,710 --> 01:51:41,430
All you gotta do is run diagonally.

1752
01:51:42,230 --> 01:51:43,570
And you'll never get hit, they say.

1753
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:47,270
Just run diagonally.

1754
01:51:47,650 --> 01:51:50,090
You'll never get hit a day in your afterlife, they say.

1755
01:51:58,170 --> 01:51:59,410
It'll be fun, they say.

1756
01:51:59,590 --> 01:52:00,890
Run diagonally, they say.

1757
01:52:03,290 --> 01:52:06,030
Run diagonally the correct way, VTuber.

1758
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:07,910
VTuber, I told you.

1759
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:10,690
Diagonal.

1760
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:11,650
Diagonal, VTuber.

1761
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:14,030
It's the only way to play the game.

1762
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:23,540
Just simply be good and win the game, VTuber.

1763
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:25,780
See?

1764
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:28,380
Okay, where the hell is my hitbox?

1765
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:30,360
If that was able to hit me...

1766
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:30,900
I'm sorry.

1767
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:31,460
What?

1768
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:33,480
I was standing next to her.

1769
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:36,660
So only sometimes does it work.

1770
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:37,140
Wait.

1771
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:40,880
Like, what?

1772
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:42,300
Tell me the logic here.

1773
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,620
You wanna know how I got these scars?

1774
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:12,980
Straight up jokeler in it.

1775
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,660
Okay, here we go.

1776
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:20,470
Oh, nice.

1777
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:24,150
Now don't screw it up, VTuber.

1778
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:30,450
VTuber, if you were to mess that up... Really?

1779
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:33,290
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

1780
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:56,120
Is VTuber even trying?

1781
01:54:03,230 --> 01:54:04,530
I'm jokeling it.

1782
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:08,510
Straight up the jokeler.

1783
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:31,020
Guys, I don't even wanna think about the next couple of chapters.

1784
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:34,740
This is 9, right?

1785
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:36,560
Out of 13?

1786
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:39,100
I don't even wanna think about the rest of them.

1787
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:44,790
I don't even wanna think about the rest of them.

1788
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:47,990
You know what pisses me off even more is I could've won potentially...

1789
01:54:49,810 --> 01:54:53,530
If there wasn't the damn time limit, which they get rid of in easy mode.

1790
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:42,770
I hate you so fucking much.

1791
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,840
It's so obnoxious when she corners you.

1792
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:37,090
I hate you so much.

1793
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:41,150
Diagonal, they said!

1794
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:42,650
Diagonal, they say!

1795
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:43,890
Diagonal!

1796
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:46,330
Oh, just run diagonally!

1797
01:56:46,510 --> 01:56:47,070
Come on!

1798
01:56:47,150 --> 01:56:48,430
You missed the shot!

1799
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:01,220
Don't even tell me!

1800
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:03,080
You don't know what my fingers are doing!

1801
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:09,970
Diagonal.

1802
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:43,260
VTuber, your fingers are just not doing a good job.

1803
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,360
VTuber, I know what you're doing.

1804
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:50,080
You're just doing a bad job at what you're doing.

1805
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:52,680
My ears are bleeding, sorry.

1806
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:52,780
Alright.

1807
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:03,460
I hate everything.

1808
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:07,500
I hate everything.

1809
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,920
I hate everything!

1810
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:21,120
What's the point of being a ghost if I... You know, once you die...

1811
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:25,000
What's the point when you still have to suffer like this?

1812
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,380
What's the point of dying?

1813
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:34,080
That's why I say being a ghost is overrated, because I'm still forced to suffer like this and I can't die again!

1814
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:40,500
This game is gonna make me straight for real.

1815
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:54,960
But this...

1816
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,220
Nobody will ever wanna kiss a ghost again.

1817
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:58,460
Fuck you.

1818
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:16,120
That's why we're here.

1819
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:17,720
Just to suffer.

1820
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:23,160
Please, thank you.

1821
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:24,680
Oh, come on, I pressed it!

1822
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:24,840
No!

1823
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:40,320
Fuck you, I went diagonal, everybody.

1824
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:43,920
Please, let it be known.

1825
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:46,600
Mental phantom went diagonal.

1826
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,440
Shit, I was already holding one.

1827
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:52,580
I shouldn't have gone up.

1828
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:54,240
I was already holding it.

1829
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,480
What's the point of me grabbing it if I forget?

1830
02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:07,190
Let the record show, I went diagonal and I still got hurt.

1831
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:15,700
Sick of your sass.

1832
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:21,040
You remind me of sea salt caramel ice cream.

1833
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:23,180
Saltiness brings out your sweetness.

1834
02:00:23,980 --> 02:00:25,140
I have no sweetness.

1835
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:29,240
You know it's over when Mint gives up on the girls.

1836
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:31,240
It's so over.

1837
02:00:40,180 --> 02:00:41,120
Oh please.

1838
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:42,560
Oh my god.

1839
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:43,540
Yes.

1840
02:00:57,310 --> 02:00:59,770
Let the record show, I went diagonal.

1841
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:03,130
I went diagonal.

1842
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:06,790
You can just go.

1843
02:01:06,950 --> 02:01:08,030
The wrong diagonal, VTuber.

1844
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:09,450
Oh, it's this guy.

1845
02:01:11,410 --> 02:01:15,010
Hi dad, have you tried only moving in counter-clockwise semicircles?

1846
02:01:15,570 --> 02:01:16,450
Like this?

1847
02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:19,350
Oh wait, why counter-clockwise?

1848
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:20,450
Why can't it be clockwise?

1849
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:28,060
I hate this game.

1850
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:30,400
I hate this game so...

1851
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,200
I don't know how I made it, but we did, baby.

1852
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:40,460
Lucky.

1853
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:41,800
Lucky, lucky.

1854
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:42,820
Shit.

1855
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:55,370
Why clockwise?

1856
02:01:56,090 --> 02:01:57,890
Why not clock-dumb?

1857
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,410
Roller, you're asking the best questions.

1858
02:02:03,870 --> 02:02:05,330
Why clockwise?

1859
02:02:06,290 --> 02:02:08,910
Why not clock-dumb?

1860
02:02:09,690 --> 02:02:14,890
A clock is correct two times a day.

1861
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:17,490
If it is dumb.

1862
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:21,490
A wise clock...

1863
02:02:23,650 --> 02:02:25,070
Is just a guy.

1864
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:27,450
A wise guy.

1865
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:34,240
I went diagonal.

1866
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,400
Let the record show, I went diagonal.

1867
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:42,160
I want everyone who ever told me to go diagonal to shut the fuck up.

1868
02:02:42,700 --> 02:02:45,360
Every time I go diagonal, and it doesn't work.

1869
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:46,820
It doesn't work.

1870
02:02:46,980 --> 02:02:49,920
It only depends on where you're standing.

1871
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:52,900
Diagonal does not always apply.

1872
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:54,860
See?

1873
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:57,060
I went diagonal.

1874
02:02:57,940 --> 02:03:01,820
I went diagonal, and it didn't do shit.

1875
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,480
You guys are so full of shit.

1876
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:05,720
I swear to god.

1877
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:13,220
My tears.

1878
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:19,120
Screw everything.

1879
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:20,560
My afterlife.

1880
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:22,720
Oh my god, we're up to the...

1881
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:24,520
No, no, no.

1882
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:30,420
Oh, I thought I was dead there.

1883
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:32,900
I don't think it's... I think I'm gonna lose it though.

1884
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:34,700
I mean, I've already lost it, but you know what I mean?

1885
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:36,000
Like, there we go, see?

1886
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:38,720
I think though, they were gonna explode.

1887
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:41,380
Having three of them is too much for me.

1888
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:46,420
Okay.

1889
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:51,540
I've been playing Minecraft, and it got me thinking this.

1890
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:53,400
Somebody get this woman on a Minecraft server.

1891
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,900
I need to see her build a giant mud temple.

1892
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:57,720
Why a mud temple?

1893
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:00,760
I

1894
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:18,880
wish there was a dodge button.

1895
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:20,220
Like a little dash.

1896
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:21,680
Dodge dash and all.

1897
02:04:22,820 --> 02:04:23,960
I wish.

1898
02:04:43,410 --> 02:04:45,130
It's messed up.

1899
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:47,410
Stop dashing at me!

1900
02:04:48,590 --> 02:04:49,590
Tis the season.

1901
02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:54,230
You know Dasher and Dasher and Dasher and Dasher.

1902
02:04:55,870 --> 02:04:59,790
Dasher and Dasher and Dasher and Dasher.

1903
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:03,090
But do you recall?

1904
02:05:03,710 --> 02:05:06,970
Oh my god, I tried picking it up, but I wasn't close enough.

1905
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:11,470
The most annoying ghost lady of all.

1906
02:05:12,770 --> 02:05:15,750
Dasher, the ugly ghost lady.

1907
02:05:16,290 --> 02:05:19,010
Everyone thinks she's hot cause just her glasses.

1908
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:22,290
But she is actually so ugly.

1909
02:05:23,110 --> 02:05:25,930
Your appearance doesn't make you a good person.

1910
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:29,890
She's so ugly with her stupid personality.

1911
02:05:30,890 --> 02:05:33,950
She might be the ugliest ghost I've ever known.

1912
02:05:33,950 --> 02:05:40,850
And if she doesn't stop dashing at my face, I might just rip her nose off.

1913
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:43,410
Alrighty.

1914
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:51,890
Stop dashing at me!

1915
02:05:55,840 --> 02:06:00,660
You know Dasher and Dasher and Dasher...

1916
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:02,080
Oh, why did I pick that up?

1917
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:05,000
Oh my god, I didn't see where I...

1918
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,480
I didn't see where she went.

1919
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:08,520
I didn't see where she went.

1920
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:09,220
That was my bad.

1921
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:20,340
It's not even her name.

1922
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:23,940
I don't remember what her name is.

1923
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:25,540
Jarvis?

1924
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:30,240
Now that's what I call the Christmas spirit.

1925
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:36,320
Thanks guys for humoring me in my time of need.

1926
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:36,820
What?

1927
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:39,520
You always go up, why do you go down now?

1928
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:41,940
Why did you change?

1929
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:44,620
You've changed, Jarvis.

1930
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,260
You've changed.

1931
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:49,720
You're not the same ghost that I used to know.

1932
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:59,020
You're not the same ghost that I used to know.

1933
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:04,400
Battery.

1934
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:19,840
Please.

1935
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:37,200
See?

1936
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:39,540
There was only one picture there, you guys.

1937
02:07:39,740 --> 02:07:40,580
I swear.

1938
02:07:40,580 --> 02:07:43,700
There was only one little question mark there.

1939
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:47,360
And then it turned into two pictures.

1940
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:48,780
It turned into a...

1941
02:07:48,780 --> 02:07:49,700
Oh, we're dead.

1942
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:55,180
There was only one.

1943
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,800
There was only one.

1944
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,880
They always show only one question mark.

1945
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:04,200
Yeah!

1946
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:10,340
And earlier I was just like, I wish that they showed two question marks when there were two items.

1947
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:13,020
And everyone was like, what are you talking about?

1948
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:13,840
They do.

1949
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:14,980
No!

1950
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:17,340
They obviously don't.

1951
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:21,960
Focus... I am... OK, you guys don't need to yell at me to focus, OK?

1952
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:22,980
I am focusing.

1953
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:27,960
I am focusing.

1954
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:31,660
It's just that sometimes...

1955
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:34,440
I don't see which one is counting down.

1956
02:08:41,410 --> 02:08:42,930
I'm not reading chat!

1957
02:08:43,010 --> 02:08:45,570
I only read chat when I'm not playing the game, OK?

1958
02:08:45,750 --> 02:08:47,410
You guys don't even know what I'm doing.

1959
02:08:47,690 --> 02:08:50,530
Stop acting like you know my afterlife, OK?

1960
02:08:50,910 --> 02:08:51,830
You don't know me!

1961
02:08:52,290 --> 02:08:53,310
You don't know me!

1962
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:58,130
You don't know me!

1963
02:08:59,310 --> 02:09:00,350
You don't know me.

1964
02:09:03,330 --> 02:09:03,850
Ah,

1965
02:09:39,220 --> 02:09:39,400
shit.

1966
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:47,120
I don't know why I did... Oh, that's why I did that.

1967
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,120
Wait, I just need this.

1968
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:54,640
Perfect.

1969
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:26,660
I think that was the last one.

1970
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:29,020
I think that was the last one.

1971
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:30,100
Oh, God.

1972
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:32,140
It's because I thought...

1973
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:33,600
I thought I needed this one.

1974
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:36,320
Instead, and then I... It's OK.

1975
02:10:37,580 --> 02:10:38,880
NT, NT, NT.

1976
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,540
NT, NT, NT.

1977
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:44,120
We're focused, everybody.

1978
02:10:44,220 --> 02:10:44,820
We're focused.

1979
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:46,900
We're focused, we're focused.

1980
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:49,020
Oh, nice.

1981
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:55,420
I was reading pretty... Reading her movements pretty well there, though.

1982
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:59,220
I think I got the decent RNG, all things considered.

1983
02:11:05,240 --> 02:11:06,120
Oh, no.

1984
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:09,120
I got the timing wrong on that.

1985
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:09,940
It's my bad.

1986
02:11:14,350 --> 02:11:17,570
She also... OK, correct me if I'm wrong, but does she only...

1987
02:11:18,190 --> 02:11:19,850
When she does the...

1988
02:11:20,850 --> 02:11:23,070
It only goes in three directions, right?

1989
02:11:24,290 --> 02:11:26,690
Or is it... I don't think it goes in all four.

1990
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:32,590
So, you have to... It is four?

1991
02:11:32,770 --> 02:11:33,670
Oh, it's a full cross.

1992
02:11:34,670 --> 02:11:35,930
OK, so I guess it depends.

1993
02:11:36,050 --> 02:11:38,370
I think I'm only noticing, like, sometimes if she's, like, here.

1994
02:11:39,150 --> 02:11:45,030
Because, you know, I'm so close to the walls all the time, because that's where the generators are, that...

1995
02:11:45,030 --> 02:11:48,050
It only looks like three, because it'll be like...

1996
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:49,450
And I don't see, like, the top.

1997
02:11:50,410 --> 02:11:51,510
Or she'll be here.

1998
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:58,010
It just fizzles if she's close to the wall.

1999
02:11:58,130 --> 02:11:58,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2000
02:12:00,230 --> 02:12:00,710
Oh,

2001
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,180
I forgot to do that again.

2002
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:39,460
I'm an idiot!

2003
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:56,060
I did it again.

2004
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:56,440
I did it again.

2005
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:12,780
Wait.

2006
02:13:17,410 --> 02:13:17,850
Huh?

2007
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:20,540
Oh, it's because I pressed the...

2008
02:13:20,990 --> 02:13:23,410
Wait, does anybody need this?

2009
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:23,930
No?

2010
02:13:26,150 --> 02:13:28,470
Guys, I messed up.

2011
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:36,580
Goodbye, world.

2012
02:13:37,780 --> 02:13:38,960
Goodbye, world.

2013
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:40,560
I messed up.

2014
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:47,000
I messed up.

2015
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:48,120
I messed up.

2016
02:14:01,610 --> 02:14:01,990
Two

2017
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:11,300
times in a row.

2018
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:13,320
I really... I diagonaled.

2019
02:14:13,740 --> 02:14:15,240
I diagonaled.

2020
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:16,700
Two times in a row.

2021
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:20,000
I did this, this...

2022
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:22,740
I did.

2023
02:14:23,980 --> 02:14:25,640
Let the record show.

2024
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:27,560
Oh, nice.

2025
02:14:30,620 --> 02:14:32,340
Let the record show.

2026
02:14:34,820 --> 02:14:35,680
I mean so.

2027
02:14:36,700 --> 02:14:37,420
Diagonaled.

2028
02:14:38,680 --> 02:14:39,980
When she needed to.

2029
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:43,240
Oh, I'm holding it.

2030
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:43,500
Ah,

2031
02:14:49,530 --> 02:14:50,330
shit.

2032
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:51,150
Shit.

2033
02:14:51,970 --> 02:14:52,690
Shit you.

2034
02:14:52,770 --> 02:14:53,810
I hope you shit your pants.

2035
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:55,810
I hope you shit your pants.

2036
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:20,400
But you have to kiss her afterwards.

2037
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:21,540
I will not!

2038
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,500
This lady deserves no love!

2039
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:29,080
This lady deserves to live like Miss Haversham for the rest of her life.

2040
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:30,920
After life.

2041
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:32,580
She's dead too.

2042
02:15:33,640 --> 02:15:35,680
I hope she lives like Miss Haversham.

2043
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:38,240
Forever!

2044
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:45,180
Imagine angry kissing.

2045
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:51,860
She probably has stinky breath.

2046
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:54,840
Unlike me.

2047
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:56,760
I taste minty fresh.

2048
02:15:56,860 --> 02:16:00,140
But this bitch tastes probably like bad Gatorade.

2049
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:12,520
Oh, I need...

2050
02:16:22,530 --> 02:16:23,250
And yes, I...

2051
02:16:24,330 --> 02:16:25,090
I

2052
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:30,080
didn't notice that.

2053
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:39,020
I don't know how I made it past that.

2054
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:39,680
Oh, wait.

2055
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:40,700
No!

2056
02:16:47,670 --> 02:16:48,310
Wait.

2057
02:16:49,550 --> 02:16:49,950
Nice.

2058
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:58,400
My eyes are actually starting to glaze over.

2059
02:16:58,480 --> 02:16:59,120
I'm not gonna lie.

2060
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:05,260
My eyes are starting to glaze over a little bit.

2061
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:07,080
It just becomes so much.

2062
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:09,000
That I'm like...

2063
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:13,040
That I'm like, there's... I just can't...

2064
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,780
I can't focus anymore.

2065
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:16,880
I can't focus anymore.

2066
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:19,700
Oh!

2067
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:23,180
It's just so many flashing lights.

2068
02:17:27,480 --> 02:17:28,120
And...

2069
02:17:28,120 --> 02:17:31,000
You have to be so like...

2070
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:32,540
Focus.

2071
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:35,080
You have to be so focused the entire time.

2072
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:37,940
Or else it's just like you miss like...

2073
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:39,860
One of these guys pops off.

2074
02:17:39,860 --> 02:17:41,240
Or wherever she's at.

2075
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:42,200
Or anything, anything.

2076
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:46,860
Gotta give you props for always having the most subtly savage burns, Mikito.

2077
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:52,260
So think about the time you wish someone would grab their belt or pancreas.

2078
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:56,660
Would you give this to Mito for Christmas for me?

2079
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:58,040
Thank you, Zachary.

2080
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:00,220
Sparks!

2081
02:18:00,300 --> 02:18:01,280
Happy birthday!

2082
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:06,500
Happy birthday to you.

2083
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:11,640
Happy birthday to you.

2084
02:18:12,220 --> 02:18:19,220
Happy birthday dear Sparks.

2085
02:18:20,460 --> 02:18:26,260
Happy birthday to you.

2086
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:28,580
Oooooh.

2087
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:45,720
Shit.

2088
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:48,500
Screw you.

2089
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:49,760
Lady.

2090
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:51,160
You're so ugly.

2091
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,300
You're so fucking ugly.

2092
02:18:56,980 --> 02:18:58,600
She didn't like that.

2093
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:04,800
I don't think she liked that.

2094
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:14,570
May all her chocolate chips be raisins.

2095
02:19:14,670 --> 02:19:17,950
Actually, I prefer oatmeal raisin cookies, though.

2096
02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:23,050
I actually prefer oatmeal raisin cookies.

2097
02:19:26,010 --> 02:19:27,310
What do you mean, huh?

2098
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:36,560
What, because I'm not trying to rot my teeth?

2099
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,400
I don't know about that take, boss.

2100
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:44,820
Well, I'm not force-feeding you the chocolate.

2101
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:45,840
Look, okay?

2102
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:47,040
Think of it this way.

2103
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:48,620
We're both sitting at a table.

2104
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:51,920
There's two cookies on said plate, on the table.

2105
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:56,300
One is chocolate chip, one is oatmeal raisin.

2106
02:19:56,460 --> 02:19:59,600
Now you can have the chocolate chip and you can have the full cookie.

2107
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:01,660
And I can have the oatmeal raisin.

2108
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:03,800
And everybody is happy.

2109
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:06,060
Faced oatmeal raisin gang.

2110
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:08,860
Alright, let's get this.

2111
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:12,720
Oh, you know what?

2112
02:20:19,690 --> 02:20:20,930
Oh, come on.

2113
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:22,270
Seriously?

2114
02:20:25,090 --> 02:20:27,670
Oh, I didn't see how low she was.

2115
02:20:28,750 --> 02:20:30,350
I didn't see how...

2116
02:20:35,530 --> 02:20:39,170
Whenever anybody is just like, Oh, you should like the same thing I like.

2117
02:20:39,770 --> 02:20:40,770
In terms of food.

2118
02:20:40,890 --> 02:20:41,670
Isn't it better?

2119
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:44,130
If we like different things?

2120
02:20:44,130 --> 02:20:47,450
Because then you can have all of the thing that you like?

2121
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:50,770
She's very low.

2122
02:20:51,050 --> 02:20:52,550
That's normal for Garbage.

2123
02:20:56,710 --> 02:21:01,030
Like someone once told me, Don't say ick to another's yum.

2124
02:21:01,270 --> 02:21:01,930
Exactly.

2125
02:21:06,430 --> 02:21:08,630
Don't yuck somebody's yum.

2126
02:21:18,020 --> 02:21:19,500
I steal the other's food.

2127
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:21,100
So I get to eat double.

2128
02:21:21,820 --> 02:21:23,300
So messed up.

2129
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:46,320
Shit.

2130
02:21:55,660 --> 02:21:57,680
Sometimes I get caught on the walls.

2131
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:58,580
Which really sucks.

2132
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:03,220
Oh, come on.

2133
02:22:03,300 --> 02:22:05,340
I hate you so much.

2134
02:22:15,490 --> 02:22:17,330
The walls make you lose all momentum.

2135
02:22:17,530 --> 02:22:18,110
It sucks.

2136
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:24,740
It does suck.

2137
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,300
I don't want to kiss ghost girls anymore.

2138
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:29,120
I hate it.

2139
02:22:29,740 --> 02:22:32,100
I'm anti-ghost girl now.

2140
02:22:32,680 --> 02:22:34,020
I'm changing my image.

2141
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,960
I'm reincarnating into something else.

2142
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:42,680
I literally press enter as I was passing that.

2143
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:43,560
Like, come on.

2144
02:22:43,960 --> 02:22:45,240
Don't be like that game.

2145
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:46,980
Don't be like that game.

2146
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:32,880
She's gonna become a gnome.

2147
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:41,200
Game's so hard it makes you want to punch the ghost, not kiss him.

2148
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:42,080
Right!

2149
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:47,800
I had trouble with a couple of the other levels.

2150
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,100
You know, I'm not a gamer.

2151
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:54,440
But this one...

2152
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:56,480
It's tilting me just a little bit.

2153
02:23:59,620 --> 02:24:00,940
Luckily, it usually...

2154
02:24:00,940 --> 02:24:02,680
Oh, I hate her.

2155
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:05,320
It usually ends so fast that I...

2156
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:08,420
You know, it's easy to just retry, luckily.

2157
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:24,440
Oh, I went to the wrong one!

2158
02:24:26,060 --> 02:24:26,660
Oopsie.

2159
02:24:27,060 --> 02:24:27,560
There we go.

2160
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:31,300
And I forgot to press it again.

2161
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:35,900
Oh,

2162
02:24:46,100 --> 02:24:47,260
come on.

2163
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:48,460
Why?

2164
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:51,980
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

2165
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:53,000
We're so dead.

2166
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:05,620
Good matter, thanks for the five gifted.

2167
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:07,760
Lucky, thanks for your gifted.

2168
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:09,480
Sorry, I can't see who's gifting stuff.

2169
02:25:09,580 --> 02:25:10,180
Thank you, Phantom.

2170
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,220
Thanks for the ten gifted.

2171
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:11,940
Thank you so much.

2172
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:13,280
Thank you, guys.

2173
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,360
I really appreciate it.

2174
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:16,480
Blow up.

2175
02:25:29,110 --> 02:25:29,430
Wait!

2176
02:25:29,690 --> 02:25:31,270
Oh, it's because I'm holding two things.

2177
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:33,790
I was gonna say, where's my other thing?

2178
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:35,770
I'm stupid!

2179
02:25:37,950 --> 02:25:39,870
That was totally my fault, though.

2180
02:25:41,830 --> 02:25:45,170
I was so... my...

2181
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:46,390
Water.

2182
02:25:49,770 --> 02:25:51,410
Please, drone, come back.

2183
02:25:52,050 --> 02:25:52,970
Drone, I miss you!

2184
02:25:53,670 --> 02:25:54,170
Drone!

2185
02:25:54,930 --> 02:25:55,390
Drone!

2186
02:25:55,730 --> 02:25:56,770
I miss you!

2187
02:26:26,510 --> 02:26:27,110
Uh-oh.

2188
02:26:27,630 --> 02:26:27,950
Uh-oh.

2189
02:26:28,090 --> 02:26:29,510
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it.

2190
02:26:30,870 --> 02:26:32,430
Guys, I don't think we're gonna make it.

2191
02:26:33,750 --> 02:26:34,190
My

2192
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:39,880
hand is cramping!

2193
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,740
Oh, my hand is cramped!

2194
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:49,140
I hate people like you.

2195
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:51,180
I hate people like you so much.

2196
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:55,580
I'm just saying, I bought this game, downloaded it and 100%ed it during the duration of this stream.

2197
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:58,420
I'm... OK, maybe I'm just being a little spicy today.

2198
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:00,640
But like... but like... OK.

2199
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:06,160
Seriously?

2200
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:07,580
Like...

2201
02:27:07,580 --> 02:27:08,940
First of all, it's free.

2202
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:10,040
You didn't buy shit.

2203
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:10,380
OK?

2204
02:27:10,860 --> 02:27:12,680
And second of all...

2205
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:20,060
I feel like people don't understand what it is like to stream and also play a game at the same time.

2206
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:22,840
Like, shut the fuck up.

2207
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:24,960
You're so obnoxious when you come to...

2208
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:25,800
I'm just saying.

2209
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:30,960
Also, everybody comes from different walks of life and afterlife.

2210
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:39,060
Like, just because you can do something with perfect ease doesn't mean everybody else can do it with your skill level.

2211
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:39,320
OK?

2212
02:27:39,580 --> 02:27:42,800
I bet I can do a million things better than you can too.

2213
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:43,700
But you know what?

2214
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:46,460
I don't come into your life and say...

2215
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:47,460
Oh, gosh.

2216
02:27:48,380 --> 02:27:51,800
I did this so way faster than you did.

2217
02:27:51,860 --> 02:27:52,640
I'm just saying.

2218
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:55,000
It takes...

2219
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:57,660
It takes nothing.

2220
02:27:57,880 --> 02:27:58,500
It's free.

2221
02:27:58,500 --> 02:27:59,620
Just like this game.

2222
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:00,620
To be nice.

2223
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:05,620
God!

2224
02:28:06,540 --> 02:28:08,140
Sorry, I've been holding that in.

2225
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:15,800
God!

2226
02:28:21,580 --> 02:28:24,040
Just joined stream and Minto is destroying someone.

2227
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:25,900
It has to be said!

2228
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:43,180
And that doesn't even just mean with the game.

2229
02:28:43,300 --> 02:28:44,080
You know...

2230
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:47,300
That's everything in life and afterlife.

2231
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:49,300
That's everything.

2232
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:52,040
Anki enough to turn into a poltergeist.

2233
02:28:52,500 --> 02:28:53,980
Nah, I'm a poltergeist.

2234
02:28:54,300 --> 02:28:56,160
Poltergeist when you start throwing things.

2235
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:06,560
Water?

2236
02:29:10,980 --> 02:29:12,420
Sorry for being spicy.

2237
02:29:14,820 --> 02:29:16,760
I went diagonal.

2238
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:18,860
Let the record show.

2239
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:22,480
Minto went...

2240
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:23,120
Diagonal.

2241
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:24,100
Not there though.

2242
02:29:33,250 --> 02:29:37,490
Usually, if I go off on people, it's in good fun and in jest.

2243
02:29:38,210 --> 02:29:38,930
But...

2244
02:29:38,930 --> 02:29:41,810
That kind of comment actually tilts me.

2245
02:29:42,630 --> 02:29:43,870
You know...

2246
02:29:43,870 --> 02:29:46,110
Things like that where someone is just like...

2247
02:29:46,110 --> 02:29:48,210
I could do it so like this.

2248
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:50,110
You should be able to do it like that.

2249
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:50,990
Oh, flip spawn thing.

2250
02:29:58,030 --> 02:29:59,710
Maybe you should be the streamer then.

2251
02:30:03,370 --> 02:30:03,850
Nice.

2252
02:30:05,250 --> 02:30:05,730
Nice.

2253
02:30:08,470 --> 02:30:09,210
Oh, wait.

2254
02:30:09,790 --> 02:30:10,130
Nice.

2255
02:30:11,730 --> 02:30:12,210
No!

2256
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:14,430
It cancelled out my double tap.

2257
02:30:16,230 --> 02:30:17,810
It cancelled out my double tap.

2258
02:30:30,850 --> 02:30:32,470
Oh, we are already at the three.

2259
02:30:32,750 --> 02:30:33,290
Oh god.

2260
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:34,970
Wait,

2261
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:42,280
this one...

2262
02:30:42,280 --> 02:30:42,860
I can do.

2263
02:30:43,300 --> 02:30:44,060
But this one...

2264
02:30:44,060 --> 02:30:44,360
Oh no.

2265
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:44,760
Wait.

2266
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:45,200
OK.

2267
02:30:45,580 --> 02:30:46,100
I can do it.

2268
02:30:47,580 --> 02:30:48,000
Nice.

2269
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:50,500
This one though...

2270
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:55,320
Guys, I don't know if we can finish this one in time.

2271
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,200
I'll try.

2272
02:30:56,200 --> 02:30:56,280
I'll try.

2273
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,160
You know...

2274
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:16,000
Dasher...

2275
02:31:19,540 --> 02:31:21,580
You know...

2276
02:31:21,580 --> 02:31:24,000
Dasher and Dasher...

2277
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:30,000
And Dasher...

2278
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:32,000
And Dasher...

2279
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:36,020
Dasher and Dasher...

2280
02:31:40,460 --> 02:31:41,820
And Dasher...

2281
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:42,880
I fucking hate you.

2282
02:31:43,780 --> 02:31:45,140
I just gave up.

2283
02:31:47,180 --> 02:31:48,420
I'm not a clown.

2284
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:49,200
Yeah, I'm Rudolph.

2285
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:54,360
But do you recall...

2286
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:59,580
The most manky reindeer of all?

2287
02:32:06,270 --> 02:32:09,970
I turned down the difficulty on this one.

2288
02:32:09,970 --> 02:32:12,150
I'm so invested.

2289
02:32:12,270 --> 02:32:13,670
I don't feel like I can anymore.

2290
02:32:14,410 --> 02:32:15,510
I'm so invested.

2291
02:32:15,630 --> 02:32:17,130
I'm like I can't turn down the difficulty.

2292
02:32:18,050 --> 02:32:18,850
I won't do it.

2293
02:32:20,150 --> 02:32:21,390
I won't do it.

2294
02:32:22,530 --> 02:32:27,150
Do you recall...

2295
02:32:27,150 --> 02:32:27,750
Oh shit.

2296
02:32:29,950 --> 02:32:35,230
The most manky ghost of all?

2297
02:32:35,790 --> 02:32:36,690
I didn't double tap.

2298
02:32:39,970 --> 02:32:40,410
I didn't double tap.

2299
02:32:40,910 --> 02:32:41,730
I'm sorry sir.

2300
02:32:42,530 --> 02:32:43,210
I'm sorry.

2301
02:32:46,470 --> 02:32:49,010
Manky the double tapper.

2302
02:32:50,590 --> 02:32:52,930
Except when she doesn't... Why do I have two of these?

2303
02:32:57,050 --> 02:33:00,370
Except when she doesn't do that.

2304
02:33:18,090 --> 02:33:19,910
Fucking... I deserve to die here.

2305
02:33:21,470 --> 02:33:22,510
I deserve to die.

2306
02:33:23,010 --> 02:33:24,110
I deserve to die.

2307
02:33:26,290 --> 02:33:27,890
I deserve to die there.

2308
02:33:29,470 --> 02:33:31,250
We're so close you guys.

2309
02:33:31,590 --> 02:33:32,650
I can taste it.

2310
02:33:33,710 --> 02:33:36,590
The sourness of her breath.

2311
02:33:38,050 --> 02:33:39,490
Cause she's nasty.

2312
02:33:40,370 --> 02:33:42,790
This is one ghost nobody wants to kiss.

2313
02:33:48,510 --> 02:33:50,750
Why did you go back down?

2314
02:33:51,670 --> 02:33:53,410
You damn bitch.

2315
02:33:53,970 --> 02:33:54,830
You know that?

2316
02:33:56,770 --> 02:33:58,490
You know how nasty you are?

2317
02:33:59,010 --> 02:34:00,350
Nobody will ever kiss you.

2318
02:34:00,510 --> 02:34:01,190
Ever again.

2319
02:34:02,150 --> 02:34:03,310
Nobody wants to kiss you.

2320
02:34:04,390 --> 02:34:05,830
I can see why, honestly.

2321
02:34:08,030 --> 02:34:10,130
Fuck, I got stuck on the wall.

2322
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:32,520
Dasher and Dasher and Dasher and Dasher.

2323
02:34:33,780 --> 02:34:36,760
Dasher and Dasher.

2324
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:40,700
Dasher and Dasher.

2325
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:42,680
Dasher?

2326
02:34:43,060 --> 02:34:44,800
I hardly even know her.

2327
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:48,500
Is this from the Helltaker guy?

2328
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:49,620
It is.

2329
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:51,760
It is, it is.

2330
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:56,980
What do you recall?

2331
02:34:57,360 --> 02:34:59,300
Sorry, this is how I'm coping, you guys.

2332
02:35:06,300 --> 02:35:09,260
No, Jengon, don't jinx me, please.

2333
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:11,080
Never say it's the run.

2334
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:13,140
Never say it's the run.

2335
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:14,720
See?

2336
02:35:15,380 --> 02:35:16,520
Don't jinx me.

2337
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:19,520
It's too much pressure.

2338
02:35:26,590 --> 02:35:27,490
Oh my god.

2339
02:35:38,640 --> 02:35:39,560
Jinx intensifies.

2340
02:36:03,700 --> 02:36:05,260
I'll take a hit for that one.

2341
02:36:11,230 --> 02:36:12,950
You guys, isn't it so great?

2342
02:36:13,550 --> 02:36:16,610
The longer I take on a level, the more we stream.

2343
02:36:20,330 --> 02:36:22,790
Oh, this will be a really fast stream, they said.

2344
02:36:23,250 --> 02:36:24,730
It's not a very long game.

2345
02:36:24,730 --> 02:36:27,710
Yeah, but think of all the content.

2346
02:36:30,810 --> 02:36:32,850
Oh my god, I hit enter.

2347
02:36:33,350 --> 02:36:35,470
I hate this game so much.

2348
02:36:36,630 --> 02:36:38,410
Oh wait, there we go.

2349
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:46,670
Dasher and Dasher and Dasher and Dasher.

2350
02:36:48,370 --> 02:36:50,590
Please, leave me alone.

2351
02:36:51,530 --> 02:36:53,430
Leave me alone.

2352
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:02,020
I've learned my lesson not to mess with women.

2353
02:37:02,600 --> 02:37:05,780
I'll never say anything perverted about a woman ever again.

2354
02:37:06,060 --> 02:37:06,580
I promise.

2355
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:08,000
I promise.

2356
02:37:08,780 --> 02:37:10,700
I'll never try to kiss women ever again.

2357
02:37:13,020 --> 02:37:13,980
I promise.

2358
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:14,820
Oh, it's this way.

2359
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:15,900
Just kidding.

2360
02:37:20,420 --> 02:37:22,140
I'll sell all my doujin.

2361
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:38,660
Lies and deception.

2362
02:37:39,380 --> 02:37:40,780
Not the doujin.

2363
02:37:41,580 --> 02:37:43,500
I'll sell my tickets to Comiket.

2364
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:50,660
I'll read BL from now on.

2365
02:37:51,140 --> 02:37:52,140
Oh, the horror.

2366
02:37:56,440 --> 02:37:59,300
Yo, this game is messed up.

2367
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:06,260
I can't believe it's been an hour and I still can barely read her moves.

2368
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:10,580
So messed up.

2369
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:17,380
She's just too good at teleporting and being fast.

2370
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:19,660
But definitely not being sexy.

2371
02:38:20,620 --> 02:38:21,980
She sucks at that.

2372
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:23,160
Oh my god.

2373
02:38:23,320 --> 02:38:24,160
Oh my god.

2374
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:25,160
Oh my god.

2375
02:38:30,010 --> 02:38:31,910
She's so fast.

2376
02:38:32,710 --> 02:38:35,070
She is so fast.

2377
02:38:36,670 --> 02:38:39,410
Do you recall the most dashing dasher of all?

2378
02:38:39,890 --> 02:38:41,610
I'm not dashing at all.

2379
02:38:42,250 --> 02:38:43,890
I haven't dashed.

2380
02:38:47,370 --> 02:38:51,230
My eyes are just... My eyes are literally jelly right now.

2381
02:38:51,750 --> 02:38:53,010
Oh, what the hell.

2382
02:38:55,110 --> 02:38:57,590
My eyes are such jelly, you guys.

2383
02:39:26,580 --> 02:39:27,700
What is this one?

2384
02:39:36,890 --> 02:39:39,650
I didn't mean to zigzag that, but I did.

2385
02:39:39,870 --> 02:39:41,070
Oh shit.

2386
02:39:41,550 --> 02:39:42,910
There is always something happening.

2387
02:39:44,190 --> 02:39:44,390
When

2388
02:40:16,090 --> 02:40:17,250
is the meeting?

2389
02:40:17,470 --> 02:40:18,730
In an hour or so.

2390
02:40:23,250 --> 02:40:25,150
My meeting is in an hour or so.

2391
02:40:25,450 --> 02:40:26,810
I don't think I'll beat the game.

2392
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:27,830
That's OK.

2393
02:40:27,830 --> 02:40:29,890
I think I'm going to uninstall it.

2394
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:36,180
Eat a pudding.

2395
02:40:36,300 --> 02:40:36,540
Yeah!

2396
02:40:37,080 --> 02:40:39,260
Why don't you guys ever give me pudding?

2397
02:40:39,860 --> 02:40:40,700
Pudding pies.

2398
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:44,280
Where is my pudding pie?

2399
02:40:44,960 --> 02:40:47,020
I think I deserve it.

2400
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:49,080
I deserve it after this.

2401
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:01,560
What flavor pudding do you want?

2402
02:41:08,560 --> 02:41:10,160
You never ask.

2403
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:11,160
OK, Solid Snake.

2404
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:15,860
Pudding pie.

2405
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:16,720
Pudding pie.

2406
02:41:25,020 --> 02:41:27,260
Come on, man.

2407
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:30,020
Where the hell even was she?

2408
02:41:43,430 --> 02:41:45,110
So much.

2409
02:41:45,590 --> 02:41:48,810
You are not sexy enough to be like this.

2410
02:41:50,170 --> 02:41:51,810
You are not.

2411
02:41:51,870 --> 02:41:58,030
You are not my type enough for me to give risk at all for you.

2412
02:41:58,030 --> 02:41:59,790
Oh my god, I got stuck on the wall.

2413
02:42:00,190 --> 02:42:02,890
Oh, and I forgot to double tap, baby.

2414
02:42:03,590 --> 02:42:04,970
Forget to double tap.

2415
02:42:05,890 --> 02:42:07,490
I love it when she's stupid.

2416
02:42:07,670 --> 02:42:09,230
I love it when she can't control anything.

2417
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:19,120
Did I grab that?

2418
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:20,820
No, because she attacked me.

2419
02:42:25,540 --> 02:42:27,500
I didn't notice the one in the corner.

2420
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:30,780
I was like, I wonder where the other one is.

2421
02:42:32,060 --> 02:42:34,120
I was so focused on trying to get the one.

2422
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:39,240
I was so focused on trying to get the one.

2423
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:47,360
The one in the corner keeps betraying you.

2424
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:50,940
Roller, I don't know how to break this to you, but all of them are in the corner.

2425
02:42:52,820 --> 02:42:55,480
Some are in the corner.

2426
02:42:59,500 --> 02:42:59,900
What

2427
02:43:09,620 --> 02:43:10,740
do you want from me, game?

2428
02:43:48,470 --> 02:43:54,370
Honestly, I like... can't even pay attention to the floors because there is so much else to pay attention to.

2429
02:43:55,090 --> 02:43:58,370
You know, there is so much else to pay attention to.

2430
02:43:58,450 --> 02:44:01,270
I'm just like, I can't even know... I just have to run and I have to hope.

2431
02:44:03,430 --> 02:44:04,650
I just have to run.

2432
02:44:11,530 --> 02:44:13,030
That's the hardest level in the game?

2433
02:44:13,670 --> 02:44:14,270
You think so?

2434
02:44:16,350 --> 02:44:16,750
And

2435
02:44:33,190 --> 02:44:36,130
then sometimes... Look at that, I ran right over it.

2436
02:44:36,290 --> 02:44:37,650
I didn't get shot.

2437
02:44:38,590 --> 02:44:40,590
It's kind of inconsistent, I feel.

2438
02:44:42,330 --> 02:44:43,970
I feel, but maybe.

2439
02:44:49,030 --> 02:44:51,910
Running and hoping seems to work.

2440
02:44:52,550 --> 02:44:54,610
It's my only hope, honestly.

2441
02:44:56,470 --> 02:44:58,110
I just have to avoid her.

2442
02:45:09,470 --> 02:45:11,330
Such bullshit, man.

2443
02:45:11,590 --> 02:45:12,610
But I got greedy there.

2444
02:45:13,130 --> 02:45:14,610
I blame myself there.

2445
02:45:15,250 --> 02:45:16,090
I got greedy.

2446
02:45:16,750 --> 02:45:19,090
I got greedy, greedy.

2447
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:33,470
Oh, OK.

2448
02:45:33,630 --> 02:45:35,370
You guys are just responding to Vector.

2449
02:45:35,490 --> 02:45:40,230
I already wished you a happy birthday.

2450
02:45:41,130 --> 02:45:42,770
You're just responding to the old message.

2451
02:45:43,250 --> 02:45:44,070
You guys are so cute.

2452
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:48,090
You got this, I believe.

2453
02:45:48,390 --> 02:45:48,890
Thank you!

2454
02:45:49,730 --> 02:45:50,450
You can do it, Miki.

2455
02:45:50,810 --> 02:45:51,290
Thank you!

2456
02:45:53,770 --> 02:45:54,590
I'm doing my bestest.

2457
02:45:55,170 --> 02:45:56,290
Maybe not my bestest.

2458
02:45:56,490 --> 02:46:00,370
Bestest would be not having a stream and no performance anxiety.

2459
02:46:06,530 --> 02:46:08,530
At least I double tapped.

2460
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:15,640
Wait, what?

2461
02:46:36,900 --> 02:46:37,940
Oh, come on.

2462
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:42,200
I just keep getting stuck on the walls.

2463
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:44,380
I keep getting stuck on the walls.

2464
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:57,520
Can you guys imagine if I tried playing this?

2465
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:07,280
If I had tried playing this...

2466
02:47:08,440 --> 02:47:09,380
4 years ago.

2467
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:16,540
There's no way I would've been able to do anything.

2468
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,060
I got mad at Yomawari.

2469
02:47:32,280 --> 02:47:32,900
I got mad at Yomawari.

2470
02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:34,040
I'm malded at Yomawari.

2471
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:36,960
I would've been able to play this.

2472
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:43,800
So if anything, the fact that I've managed this so far...

2473
02:47:43,800 --> 02:47:46,760
is I guess a bit of a...

2474
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:49,760
Fuck you.

2475
02:47:50,760 --> 02:47:51,820
Fuck you, I said.

2476
02:47:51,900 --> 02:47:52,760
Fuck you, guy.

2477
02:48:01,550 --> 02:48:03,010
I don't know who raided me.

2478
02:48:04,110 --> 02:48:06,630
But if anybody tells you to play this game, don't do it.

2479
02:48:07,830 --> 02:48:09,710
The ghost kisses aren't worth it.

2480
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:12,450
They're not worth it, I promise you.

2481
02:48:13,050 --> 02:48:13,950
Don't do it.

2482
02:48:14,530 --> 02:48:15,470
Don't play.

2483
02:48:16,590 --> 02:48:18,270
Avaria, don't do it.

2484
02:48:18,550 --> 02:48:19,670
It's not worth it.

2485
02:48:21,350 --> 02:48:22,610
Don't do it.

2486
02:48:23,250 --> 02:48:24,470
Save yourself.

2487
02:48:26,050 --> 02:48:27,230
Save yourself.

2488
02:48:28,990 --> 02:48:32,930
Don't play Avaria at midnight.

2489
02:48:33,570 --> 02:48:34,410
Oh, fuck me.

2490
02:48:35,690 --> 02:48:37,030
Don't do it.

2491
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:38,690
It's not worth it.

2492
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:50,760
Minto, you inspired me to try this and it's way harder than it looks.

2493
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:51,140
You know what?

2494
02:48:51,180 --> 02:48:51,720
Thank you.

2495
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:58,080
Thank you for saying that and not being like...

2496
02:48:58,080 --> 02:49:00,260
Oh, I beat it in the same exact amount of time.

2497
02:49:00,780 --> 02:49:02,660
So you make me feel less like a failure.

2498
02:49:04,580 --> 02:49:07,500
Were there any other games that made you mad when you were streaming 4 years ago?

2499
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:08,900
Yeah, Yomawari.

2500
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:12,380
Yomawari made me mauled for the first time ever.

2501
02:49:14,300 --> 02:49:16,040
Look how far we've come.

2502
02:49:23,980 --> 02:49:24,860
Oh, wow.

2503
02:49:24,940 --> 02:49:27,480
I got got by the floor two times.

2504
02:49:41,620 --> 02:49:42,720
I want to see.

2505
02:49:42,820 --> 02:49:43,120
Let's see.

2506
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:43,540
Hold on.

2507
02:49:58,700 --> 02:50:00,500
Oh, you just don't have a little guy.

2508
02:50:01,400 --> 02:50:02,620
Oh, so it's a one hit kill.

2509
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:05,500
Oh, that's it?

2510
02:50:20,370 --> 02:50:24,510
Guys, I appreciate you having faith in me, but...

2511
02:50:25,170 --> 02:50:25,670
Don't.

2512
02:50:26,470 --> 02:50:28,530
The generators are also slightly faster.

2513
02:50:29,050 --> 02:50:30,230
Oh, the timer!

2514
02:50:30,650 --> 02:50:31,110
The timer.

2515
02:50:31,250 --> 02:50:32,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2516
02:50:39,490 --> 02:50:40,810
Oh, I need a break.

2517
02:50:44,630 --> 02:50:47,830
My eyes are so glossy.

2518
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:27,200
My mom just texted me and it's just like, here's what you need to pick up for Christmas.

2519
02:51:29,660 --> 02:51:32,800
I didn't even... She didn't even ask me.

2520
02:51:34,520 --> 02:51:37,260
I didn't even know I was meeting her for Christmas.

2521
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:59,780
She said, let me know... Wait, she texted my family group chat.

2522
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:03,920
It was like, oh, let's do something the 26th instead.

2523
02:52:05,300 --> 02:52:07,080
Let me know ASAP.

2524
02:52:07,240 --> 02:52:08,420
I have to order it tonight.

2525
02:52:08,580 --> 02:52:10,520
And then 20 minutes later, ordered it.

2526
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:13,980
And then said, here's the pickup order.

2527
02:52:14,060 --> 02:52:14,840
Go get it, Minto.

2528
02:52:23,730 --> 02:52:25,430
She didn't even ask.

2529
02:52:29,570 --> 02:52:31,910
I didn't even think that we were meeting up.

2530
02:52:32,570 --> 02:52:34,410
I thought I had Christmas free.

2531
02:52:35,890 --> 02:52:38,630
Because my mom told me she was going to be out of town.

2532
02:52:40,290 --> 02:52:41,630
Oh my god.

2533
02:52:41,890 --> 02:52:43,110
I was going to stream.

2534
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:48,680
Surprise!

2535
02:52:52,620 --> 02:52:54,660
But not the 26th, apparently.

2536
02:52:55,460 --> 02:52:57,280
Does anyone else's parents do that?

2537
02:52:57,900 --> 02:53:01,500
My mom is notorious about just volunteering people.

2538
02:53:02,720 --> 02:53:04,780
Here's what you need to pick up for Christmas, Matara.

2539
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:06,740
No, leave her to rot.

2540
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:09,680
Yes, yes, yes.

2541
02:53:13,360 --> 02:53:13,960
Voluntold.

2542
02:53:14,040 --> 02:53:16,120
Yes, that's exactly it.

2543
02:53:16,840 --> 02:53:18,580
Oh my gosh.

2544
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:18,960
No.

2545
02:53:24,320 --> 02:53:26,680
Okay, I'm going to go get a drink real quick.

2546
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:31,620
Maybe I shouldn't have played this game on just coffee.

2547
02:53:31,780 --> 02:53:33,060
Because I'm shaking, baby.

2548
02:53:33,720 --> 02:53:34,600
I'm shaking.

2549
02:53:35,120 --> 02:53:36,840
I'm shaking 30 whispers.

2550
02:53:38,040 --> 02:53:39,320
Such a mom thing.

2551
02:53:39,400 --> 02:53:40,140
It really is.

2552
02:53:41,100 --> 02:53:44,000
I'll have, like, friends come over...

2553
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:48,960
And my mom will be like, hey, by the way, can you and your friends, like...

2554
02:53:49,640 --> 02:53:51,520
Break the leaves in my yard?

2555
02:53:52,340 --> 02:53:53,180
What do you mean?

2556
02:53:54,580 --> 02:53:56,180
What do you mean by that?

2557
02:53:58,480 --> 02:53:59,580
Sending you good vibes.

2558
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:00,580
Hope you have a good meal later.

2559
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:01,280
Thank you!

2560
02:54:01,740 --> 02:54:03,360
Sounds like your mom volunteered to stream.

2561
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:06,600
The mom tax.

2562
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:12,020
My mom does the same thing.

2563
02:54:12,080 --> 02:54:13,380
Is it just a mom thing?

2564
02:54:14,700 --> 02:54:15,720
I don't understand.

2565
02:54:17,140 --> 02:54:18,340
She makes the guests work.

2566
02:54:18,440 --> 02:54:18,800
Yes!

2567
02:54:21,900 --> 02:54:23,840
And she never asks beforehand.

2568
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,580
She'll just be like, okay, you're going to do this.

2569
02:54:27,060 --> 02:54:28,060
Okay, let me go get a drink.

2570
02:54:29,400 --> 02:54:31,220
Let me go get some water.

2571
02:54:33,740 --> 02:54:34,460
Or, GamerSubsCodeBoomer.

2572
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:38,060
GamerSubsCodeBoomer?

2573
02:54:38,400 --> 02:54:39,540
For 10% off your order?

2574
02:54:42,320 --> 02:54:44,700
Wait, wait, gamer... What would it be?

2575
02:54:46,360 --> 02:54:47,400
What's a gamer flavor?

2576
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:48,580
Guys, name a flavor.

2577
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:50,440
And I'll let you know if I have it.

2578
02:54:54,680 --> 02:54:55,220
Nice plug.

2579
02:54:55,360 --> 02:54:55,680
Thank you.

2580
02:54:58,700 --> 02:54:59,080
Piss.

2581
02:54:59,240 --> 02:54:59,660
Shut up.

2582
02:55:00,180 --> 02:55:00,520
Lemonade!

2583
02:55:00,620 --> 02:55:01,400
I have lemonade!

2584
02:55:01,940 --> 02:55:03,220
Lemonade is a gamer drink.

2585
02:55:03,260 --> 02:55:04,060
I'm going to go get some lemonade.

2586
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:05,180
I'll be right back!

2587
02:57:27,660 --> 02:57:29,720
You guys, I made lemonade.

2588
02:57:31,940 --> 02:57:33,060
And, and...

2589
02:57:33,060 --> 02:57:36,260
I put raspberries, fresh raspberries in it.

2590
02:57:38,140 --> 02:57:40,120
I put raspberries in it.

2591
02:57:42,160 --> 02:57:43,940
I wonder if I should try controller.

2592
02:57:46,180 --> 02:57:48,960
I know I'm used to...

2593
02:57:48,960 --> 02:57:50,600
Hold on, my controller is connecting.

2594
02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:54,060
I know I'm used to the keyboard by now, but I'm wondering...

2595
02:57:55,100 --> 02:57:56,980
Even though I don't know what these controls are.

2596
02:57:58,480 --> 02:57:59,300
My health?

2597
02:57:59,420 --> 02:58:00,140
We'll try it out.

2598
02:58:00,200 --> 02:58:00,900
We'll try it out.

2599
02:58:12,970 --> 02:58:14,530
Oh, I'm so stupid?

2600
02:58:16,130 --> 02:58:17,210
I think... Oh, OK.

2601
02:58:18,450 --> 02:58:19,130
Oh god.

2602
02:58:19,270 --> 02:58:19,850
Oh god.

2603
02:58:25,130 --> 02:58:26,350
I might be an idiot.

2604
02:58:31,560 --> 02:58:32,540
No, really, Mito?

2605
02:58:33,380 --> 02:58:34,220
No, really?

2606
02:58:43,490 --> 02:58:44,510
Fresh water!

2607
02:58:49,590 --> 02:58:50,570
Fresh water!

2608
02:58:51,650 --> 02:58:51,930
Delivered.

2609
02:58:52,270 --> 02:58:52,550
Baby.

2610
02:59:06,490 --> 02:59:07,290
Fresh water.

2611
02:59:08,410 --> 02:59:09,110
Fresh water.

2612
02:59:10,990 --> 02:59:12,130
Oh, you bitch.

2613
02:59:41,090 --> 02:59:42,450
How close did I get?

2614
02:59:50,400 --> 02:59:51,440
6 out of 8?

2615
02:59:51,720 --> 02:59:52,480
7 out of 8?

2616
02:59:52,960 --> 02:59:53,860
Yeah, I was close.

2617
02:59:55,180 --> 02:59:58,340
OK, maybe... I actually feel so much easier on controller.

2618
02:59:58,520 --> 02:59:59,680
I should have switched earlier.

2619
03:00:00,020 --> 03:00:01,880
Thank you so much.

2620
03:00:03,480 --> 03:00:04,440
I don't know.

2621
03:00:04,800 --> 03:00:06,890
For the don't know...

2622
03:00:07,400 --> 03:00:08,660
The gifted membership.

2623
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:09,700
The donated membership.

2624
03:00:10,060 --> 03:00:11,680
I can't think anymore.

2625
03:00:13,160 --> 03:00:14,640
I can't think anymore.

2626
03:00:16,120 --> 03:00:16,460
OK.

2627
03:00:18,040 --> 03:00:20,140
Maybe I should have switched so much sooner.

2628
03:00:22,480 --> 03:00:24,480
Isn't that just so funny?

2629
03:00:25,460 --> 03:00:26,760
OK, never mind.

2630
03:00:26,840 --> 03:00:28,140
I tried to dodge and...

2631
03:00:28,740 --> 03:00:30,100
Everything was ruined.

2632
03:00:31,980 --> 03:00:33,260
Everything was ruined.

2633
03:00:34,200 --> 03:00:35,280
My whole afterlife.

2634
03:00:35,880 --> 03:00:37,300
Ruined by this game.

2635
03:00:38,640 --> 03:00:40,800
And I can double tap way easily.

2636
03:00:41,160 --> 03:00:42,040
Way more easily, too.

2637
03:00:47,460 --> 03:00:50,280
I said that and then...

2638
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:52,000
Now all I need...

2639
03:00:52,900 --> 03:00:54,240
Couple thanks for the gifted.

2640
03:00:55,200 --> 03:00:55,660
Thanks!

2641
03:00:59,940 --> 03:01:00,200
OK.

2642
03:01:00,620 --> 03:01:00,840
Oh.

2643
03:01:01,500 --> 03:01:02,360
There we go.

2644
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:20,220
I'm still ending up getting stuck on walls, though.

2645
03:01:24,700 --> 03:01:25,380
Water!

2646
03:01:26,300 --> 03:01:27,120
Fresh water.

2647
03:01:35,500 --> 03:01:36,540
Screw you.

2648
03:01:37,820 --> 03:01:38,900
Screw... Oh wait.

2649
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:45,360
Alright.

2650
03:01:51,980 --> 03:01:52,540
So

2651
03:01:57,180 --> 03:01:57,740
many...

2652
03:01:57,740 --> 03:01:58,700
Where was it?

2653
03:01:58,760 --> 03:01:59,080
This way.

2654
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:06,200
If I can like clip around...

2655
03:02:07,300 --> 03:02:10,440
Like the wall when she tries to dash at me...

2656
03:02:10,960 --> 03:02:13,200
It's way easier to...

2657
03:02:14,140 --> 03:02:14,760
Oh, whoops.

2658
03:02:14,960 --> 03:02:16,580
That's not what I meant to grab at all.

2659
03:02:17,460 --> 03:02:18,020
Stupid.

2660
03:02:18,460 --> 03:02:19,980
Actually, maybe it's fine.

2661
03:02:31,620 --> 03:02:34,300
I need... I need that little guy.

2662
03:02:42,230 --> 03:02:43,090
Where's the last one?

2663
03:02:43,170 --> 03:02:43,510
Oh no!

2664
03:02:43,950 --> 03:02:44,430
The time!

2665
03:02:45,950 --> 03:02:46,390
Wait,

2666
03:03:04,060 --> 03:03:04,300
bitch!

2667
03:03:04,660 --> 03:03:05,980
You're so fucking ugly!

2668
03:03:06,780 --> 03:03:07,520
Die alone!

2669
03:03:13,260 --> 03:03:14,020
Oh my gosh.

2670
03:03:14,080 --> 03:03:17,460
I think I would have completed it so much more quickly if I had just switched to controller.

2671
03:03:18,400 --> 03:03:19,160
I'm a fool.

2672
03:03:19,880 --> 03:03:20,560
Now kiss her.

2673
03:03:20,620 --> 03:03:21,260
I don't want to.

2674
03:03:21,340 --> 03:03:22,320
You guys can have her.

2675
03:03:23,340 --> 03:03:24,080
Dead hole!

2676
03:03:24,200 --> 03:03:25,700
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

2677
03:03:26,280 --> 03:03:27,080
Thank you!

2678
03:03:28,620 --> 03:03:31,200
I gave it everything I had and you still refuse to die.

2679
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:32,440
You're good at this, Ula.

2680
03:03:32,560 --> 03:03:33,120
I'll give you that.

2681
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:34,560
Wait, how do they know my name?

2682
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:35,920
I thought they lost their memories.

2683
03:03:37,560 --> 03:03:38,360
Rat bag!

2684
03:03:38,600 --> 03:03:40,020
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

2685
03:03:40,120 --> 03:03:40,980
Thank you!

2686
03:03:42,440 --> 03:03:43,420
Common mint toy.

2687
03:03:43,700 --> 03:03:43,960
No.

2688
03:03:45,160 --> 03:03:46,300
Thank you, thank you.

2689
03:03:47,640 --> 03:03:48,280
Bad dog!

2690
03:03:48,360 --> 03:03:49,160
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

2691
03:03:49,260 --> 03:03:49,900
Thank you!

2692
03:03:51,480 --> 03:03:52,260
Bingo game.

2693
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:55,120
Wait,

2694
03:03:58,740 --> 03:03:59,780
Ula, that's your name.

2695
03:04:00,340 --> 03:04:02,740
It's Ula Lestarka, right?

2696
03:04:03,180 --> 03:04:04,340
But how do I know that?

2697
03:04:04,740 --> 03:04:05,260
Look!

2698
03:04:05,360 --> 03:04:06,280
They're starting to remember.

2699
03:04:07,480 --> 03:04:11,420
They're starting to remember their big old polyamorous relationship.

2700
03:04:13,440 --> 03:04:14,980
This company is freaky.

2701
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:17,960
This is a freakier game than I realized.

2702
03:04:18,980 --> 03:04:20,040
Hurt the eyes.

2703
03:04:21,560 --> 03:04:22,760
They're doing the doki.

2704
03:04:23,300 --> 03:04:23,820
The doki.

2705
03:04:30,270 --> 03:04:33,890
It's as if... It's like I remember you from before the...

2706
03:04:33,890 --> 03:04:34,830
Sorry, creator.

2707
03:04:34,950 --> 03:04:35,350
Thank you.

2708
03:04:36,950 --> 03:04:37,910
I know you.

2709
03:04:38,010 --> 03:04:40,730
You are... I have it in the back of my head.

2710
03:04:42,650 --> 03:04:43,530
Ah, forget it.

2711
03:04:43,550 --> 03:04:45,590
I don't need to know who the hell you are.

2712
03:04:47,130 --> 03:04:49,930
One day you'll make a mistake and I'll finally kill you.

2713
03:04:49,930 --> 03:04:52,510
Yeah, not today though.

2714
03:04:54,590 --> 03:04:55,610
Definitely didn't.

2715
03:04:55,770 --> 03:04:56,790
First try everybody.

2716
03:04:59,110 --> 03:05:02,430
I'll make it slow ripping you apart limb by limb.

2717
03:05:05,690 --> 03:05:06,950
Here you guys go.

2718
03:05:07,090 --> 03:05:08,030
You can have this one.

2719
03:05:08,250 --> 03:05:08,930
This isn't me.

2720
03:05:16,180 --> 03:05:17,380
The reverse!

2721
03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:19,540
The reverse!

2722
03:05:20,380 --> 03:05:22,760
Wait, I don't want you guys getting kissed by ghosts.

2723
03:05:23,920 --> 03:05:26,100
You guys can't be kissed by ghosts.

2724
03:05:32,280 --> 03:05:34,700
You guys got lucky today.

2725
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:37,440
Too late, you said it.

2726
03:05:37,680 --> 03:05:38,920
You're lucky today!

2727
03:05:41,820 --> 03:05:42,960
But it wasn't me.

2728
03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:46,340
It wasn't me.

2729
03:05:47,860 --> 03:05:49,120
Hi, not so tough now.

2730
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:50,220
Oh my god.

2731
03:05:50,760 --> 03:05:51,640
That's so cute.

2732
03:05:51,640 --> 03:05:53,540
Not so tough now, are you?

2733
03:05:53,620 --> 03:05:56,720
It looks like this time I've emerged on top after all.

2734
03:05:57,240 --> 03:05:57,680
You know what?

2735
03:05:57,720 --> 03:05:59,680
After all of that...

2736
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:04,920
This character does deserve the kiss rather than the ghost.

2737
03:06:05,020 --> 03:06:06,240
The ghost deserves nothing.

2738
03:06:12,200 --> 03:06:13,960
I can't believe you just did that.

2739
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:18,940
Chapter 10, question mark, question mark, question mark.

2740
03:06:21,780 --> 03:06:23,980
Where's that little pup from sector F?

2741
03:06:24,180 --> 03:06:26,020
We can't afford to lose anymore runners this week.

2742
03:06:26,340 --> 03:06:27,440
I'll go check on her.

2743
03:06:32,820 --> 03:06:35,560
Wait, drinking this stuff leads to death?

2744
03:06:36,120 --> 03:06:36,980
What does that mean?

2745
03:06:37,140 --> 03:06:38,660
Oh my gosh, I'm not Ula anymore.

2746
03:06:47,220 --> 03:06:47,740
Hello?

2747
03:06:47,740 --> 03:06:48,260
Dash?

2748
03:06:48,660 --> 03:06:50,380
Wait, what is Dash?

2749
03:06:53,120 --> 03:06:53,680
Oh?

2750
03:06:56,220 --> 03:06:57,200
Oh, huh?

2751
03:07:00,710 --> 03:07:02,730
Why did I have to use all my dashes up?

2752
03:07:13,480 --> 03:07:14,620
Oh, ouchie ouch.

2753
03:07:16,640 --> 03:07:17,960
Dang, she's fast.

2754
03:07:18,620 --> 03:07:19,980
She's really fast.

2755
03:07:21,400 --> 03:07:22,780
Oh, there's water?

2756
03:07:24,020 --> 03:07:27,720
Oh gosh, I haven't noticed who... Oh my god, it's all of them.

2757
03:07:28,620 --> 03:07:30,520
This is so evil.

2758
03:07:34,540 --> 03:07:35,900
This is so evil.

2759
03:07:52,660 --> 03:07:55,060
I'm getting lost in the sauce.

2760
03:07:55,160 --> 03:07:55,960
I'm like, what do I need?

2761
03:07:56,880 --> 03:07:57,720
What do I need?

2762
03:07:58,920 --> 03:07:59,660
Ouchie ouch.

2763
03:08:00,660 --> 03:08:01,760
Wait, I can keep dashing?

2764
03:08:05,240 --> 03:08:06,640
Oh, I can keep dashing.

2765
03:08:06,980 --> 03:08:07,400
Oh!

2766
03:08:08,120 --> 03:08:09,160
Oh, I didn't realize.

2767
03:08:09,280 --> 03:08:10,980
I thought there was... Oh, ok, ok.

2768
03:08:10,980 --> 03:08:15,980
I was like, why did they have me use it up if I'm just gonna...

2769
03:08:20,450 --> 03:08:22,110
I was like, what's the point?

2770
03:08:24,890 --> 03:08:28,250
The scraping of the thing is so creepy.

2771
03:08:29,510 --> 03:08:30,610
Come over here.

2772
03:08:37,110 --> 03:08:38,130
What do I need?

2773
03:08:38,250 --> 03:08:38,570
Water.

2774
03:08:52,650 --> 03:08:52,970
Ouch!

2775
03:08:53,350 --> 03:08:57,370
Ok, so dash is not invincibility.

2776
03:08:57,490 --> 03:08:58,090
Got it.

2777
03:08:58,990 --> 03:09:00,790
Wait, you can dash through projectiles.

2778
03:09:00,850 --> 03:09:02,230
Wait, dashing has eye frames.

2779
03:09:03,290 --> 03:09:04,170
But I tried.

2780
03:09:05,150 --> 03:09:09,530
And I tried dashing through the... But you can't dash through the ghost, I'm guessing.

2781
03:09:10,110 --> 03:09:10,670
It is?

2782
03:09:10,910 --> 03:09:12,250
Wait, then why didn't it work?

2783
03:09:13,370 --> 03:09:14,710
I just landed on her.

2784
03:09:15,030 --> 03:09:15,030
Oh.

2785
03:09:16,870 --> 03:09:18,150
Isn't that so silly?

2786
03:09:24,400 --> 03:09:25,360
Oh, Metal Gear.

2787
03:09:32,140 --> 03:09:33,120
How many are there?

2788
03:09:33,120 --> 03:09:33,500
Eight?

2789
03:09:33,640 --> 03:09:35,280
Oh, this game is torturous.

2790
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:40,880
Oh, shoot.

2791
03:09:53,780 --> 03:09:55,980
I'm getting so lost in the sauce.

2792
03:09:56,140 --> 03:09:57,160
Holy hell.

2793
03:09:57,740 --> 03:10:00,340
Oh my god, it's so much to look at.

2794
03:10:00,820 --> 03:10:03,640
Oh, I'm getting so lost in the sauce.

2795
03:10:06,160 --> 03:10:09,720
Oh my goodness, it's so hard to keep track of everything.

2796
03:10:10,460 --> 03:10:12,140
Information overload real.

2797
03:10:15,220 --> 03:10:17,140
There we go.

2798
03:10:24,110 --> 03:10:25,510
Oh, there we go.

2799
03:10:28,010 --> 03:10:28,530
Seriously?

2800
03:10:38,910 --> 03:10:39,710
Oh my god.

2801
03:10:41,050 --> 03:10:43,230
Wait, so is there a cooldown on the dash?

2802
03:10:43,530 --> 03:10:44,010
Oh my god.

2803
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:48,980
Yeah, a bit.

2804
03:10:49,520 --> 03:10:50,720
You can't like spam it.

2805
03:11:05,680 --> 03:11:08,480
Oh, I forgot she spawned there.

2806
03:11:09,500 --> 03:11:10,420
Oh, hello?

2807
03:11:10,640 --> 03:11:11,160
So fast.

2808
03:11:14,540 --> 03:11:16,220
Come on, stop camping.

2809
03:11:16,980 --> 03:11:18,320
She turns around so fast.

2810
03:11:28,820 --> 03:11:30,880
Oh, that's not what I meant to grab.

2811
03:11:31,400 --> 03:11:31,820
You know what?

2812
03:11:33,280 --> 03:11:33,880
Shit.

2813
03:11:37,380 --> 03:11:38,940
Oh wait, this works.

2814
03:11:41,840 --> 03:11:42,680
This one.

2815
03:11:46,240 --> 03:11:47,200
And water.

2816
03:11:50,020 --> 03:11:50,940
Wait, please.

2817
03:12:09,260 --> 03:12:10,880
Oh shit, I didn't press that.

2818
03:12:15,240 --> 03:12:16,440
You bitch.

2819
03:12:22,020 --> 03:12:23,740
I don't know what's broken.

2820
03:12:25,640 --> 03:12:27,360
Oh wait, I need you.

2821
03:12:36,180 --> 03:12:37,320
Was that the last one?

2822
03:12:38,920 --> 03:12:40,380
Was that the last one?

2823
03:12:40,720 --> 03:12:41,180
Dang.

2824
03:12:43,760 --> 03:12:44,640
Almost had that one.

2825
03:12:44,640 --> 03:12:44,900
Yeah.

2826
03:12:46,920 --> 03:12:47,740
All done.

2827
03:12:48,240 --> 03:12:49,460
See, we know we can do it.

2828
03:12:50,280 --> 03:12:53,280
Gosh, the switch to controller makes this so much smoother.

2829
03:12:53,860 --> 03:12:54,460
I swear.

2830
03:12:56,460 --> 03:12:58,120
It's so much easier.

2831
03:13:01,840 --> 03:13:03,180
It's so much nicer.

2832
03:13:05,400 --> 03:13:05,800
Oh.

2833
03:13:09,380 --> 03:13:09,780
Alright.

2834
03:13:12,820 --> 03:13:14,240
Wait, I thought that was broken.

2835
03:13:14,340 --> 03:13:14,960
This one is broken.

2836
03:13:27,950 --> 03:13:28,910
What's the broken one?

2837
03:13:28,990 --> 03:13:29,910
Oh, there it is down here.

2838
03:13:30,910 --> 03:13:31,890
Oh please, please.

2839
03:13:32,070 --> 03:13:33,290
Oh, it's the...

2840
03:13:33,990 --> 03:13:34,310
Damn.

2841
03:13:43,340 --> 03:13:44,200
What's the broken one?

2842
03:13:57,710 --> 03:13:59,570
Oh, I ran into it.

2843
03:14:03,110 --> 03:14:04,850
You were nerfing yourself for no reason.

2844
03:14:05,090 --> 03:14:05,630
I know.

2845
03:14:08,050 --> 03:14:08,850
It's okay.

2846
03:14:09,490 --> 03:14:10,330
We know now.

2847
03:14:11,850 --> 03:14:12,950
NT, NT, NT.

2848
03:14:13,090 --> 03:14:14,430
Everybody, NT, NT, NT.

2849
03:14:15,250 --> 03:14:16,210
NT, NT, NT.

2850
03:14:32,640 --> 03:14:34,560
Oh, I need metal gear.

2851
03:14:40,920 --> 03:14:41,920
This one.

2852
03:14:43,340 --> 03:14:45,460
It's hard to find what I need.

2853
03:14:47,240 --> 03:14:47,840
Please.

2854
03:14:50,160 --> 03:14:52,220
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

2855
03:14:52,660 --> 03:14:53,600
Where is it?

2856
03:14:53,660 --> 03:14:55,520
Where is the broken one down here?

2857
03:14:57,920 --> 03:14:59,100
Metal gear.

2858
03:15:00,860 --> 03:15:01,220
You.

2859
03:15:01,960 --> 03:15:03,180
Oh my god.

2860
03:15:09,280 --> 03:15:10,380
Oh gosh.

2861
03:15:36,740 --> 03:15:38,500
We just keep dodging past her?

2862
03:15:54,110 --> 03:15:54,450
Oh shit.

2863
03:15:55,490 --> 03:15:56,130
I tried.

2864
03:16:00,450 --> 03:16:01,330
Water.

2865
03:16:09,990 --> 03:16:12,750
You, you, you, you.

2866
03:16:28,740 --> 03:16:32,360
Guys, I keep getting stuck.

2867
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:48,780
Nah, we're getting close.

2868
03:16:50,400 --> 03:16:51,560
We're getting close.

2869
03:16:51,620 --> 03:16:52,760
I'm just, you know...

2870
03:16:55,960 --> 03:17:00,700
It's when everything... You have to clear your brain.

2871
03:17:01,580 --> 03:17:06,200
It's like when you're playing a rhythm game and you have to not focus on the notes.

2872
03:17:06,500 --> 03:17:10,060
But sometimes I forget what's the order of operations, you know what I mean?

2873
03:17:11,080 --> 03:17:15,240
I'm like, oh god, what do I... I tried to dodge there and it didn't work.

2874
03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:21,280
I'm like, what items do I need to create the thing?

2875
03:17:26,430 --> 03:17:27,810
The flow state.

2876
03:17:32,350 --> 03:17:36,220
I like this level a lot better though.

2877
03:17:38,380 --> 03:17:42,700
I can say I like this level much more though.

2878
03:17:44,720 --> 03:17:45,780
Than the other one.

2879
03:17:56,690 --> 03:17:58,130
Even if it's three of them.

2880
03:17:59,230 --> 03:18:01,330
It still feels more manageable somehow.

2881
03:18:18,260 --> 03:18:18,940
Ouch!

2882
03:18:23,240 --> 03:18:24,720
Oh, I have two of these.

2883
03:18:27,560 --> 03:18:29,620
I just keep grabbing batteries.

2884
03:18:51,690 --> 03:18:54,750
I wish though...

2885
03:18:54,750 --> 03:19:02,610
The knife, the other cutter girl would come in after you do a third thing.

2886
03:19:03,890 --> 03:19:05,610
That's my only like...

2887
03:19:15,820 --> 03:19:18,520
Oh my god, I did not... Oh my god.

2888
03:19:22,780 --> 03:19:24,880
This level without dash would be diabolical.

2889
03:19:24,980 --> 03:19:26,380
Oh, I don't think it would be possible.

2890
03:19:27,300 --> 03:19:27,700
Honestly.

2891
03:19:28,880 --> 03:19:32,300
If we didn't have the dash, I think it would be...

2892
03:19:32,300 --> 03:19:33,720
Actually impossible.

2893
03:19:44,010 --> 03:19:44,530
Whoopsie.

2894
03:20:00,300 --> 03:20:03,500
Oh, come on, I pressed it.

2895
03:20:03,560 --> 03:20:05,100
Please don't be like that.

2896
03:20:06,260 --> 03:20:07,960
Oh, I got stuck on the wall.

2897
03:20:52,520 --> 03:20:53,940
What's wrong with you?

2898
03:20:55,320 --> 03:20:59,960
Actually, I asked myself that same question everyday.

2899
03:21:00,260 --> 03:21:03,700
Oh my god, it's so easy to get...

2900
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:07,200
To get cornered.

2901
03:21:11,300 --> 03:21:13,960
It's so easy to get cornered in this one.

2902
03:21:21,540 --> 03:21:22,420
Corn nerd.

2903
03:21:22,780 --> 03:21:24,380
Yeah, I am a corn nerd.

2904
03:21:24,480 --> 03:21:25,140
What of it?

2905
03:21:27,880 --> 03:21:29,140
Yeah, I love corn.

2906
03:21:29,480 --> 03:21:30,180
What about it?

2907
03:21:31,400 --> 03:21:32,920
Yeah, I'm a corn nerd.

2908
03:21:39,980 --> 03:21:41,260
Did I grab it?

2909
03:21:41,400 --> 03:21:41,820
Oh, I did.

2910
03:21:41,940 --> 03:21:42,320
Okay, good.

2911
03:21:43,600 --> 03:21:44,040
Why

2912
03:21:58,840 --> 03:22:02,660
can't the game give you, like, one second of high frames, please?

2913
03:22:07,800 --> 03:22:09,500
I swallowed my spit wrong.

2914
03:22:13,570 --> 03:22:14,950
Blood for the blood god.

2915
03:22:17,610 --> 03:22:18,050
Trill.

2916
03:22:21,350 --> 03:22:22,050
Oh, okay.

2917
03:22:42,970 --> 03:22:46,410
Oh, I dashed, but I think I... Oh wait, I went to the wrong one.

2918
03:22:50,650 --> 03:22:51,530
Don't you have a meeting?

2919
03:22:51,670 --> 03:22:52,530
Yeah, in 40 minutes.

2920
03:22:52,830 --> 03:22:53,190
Don't worry.

2921
03:22:53,590 --> 03:22:54,330
You don't need to baby me.

2922
03:22:54,550 --> 03:22:55,390
I know what time it is.

2923
03:23:00,270 --> 03:23:01,290
I'm all good.

2924
03:23:04,490 --> 03:23:09,490
Now, I don't think we'll be able to beat the game today, but...

2925
03:23:11,230 --> 03:23:11,910
You know.

2926
03:23:13,710 --> 03:23:14,110
Baby.

2927
03:23:15,690 --> 03:23:16,490
Coughing baby.

2928
03:23:17,310 --> 03:23:18,410
I know it's hard.

2929
03:23:18,590 --> 03:23:22,170
It's easy to think I'm a coughing baby because I do the baby cough.

2930
03:23:25,650 --> 03:23:26,770
Oh, damn it.

2931
03:23:27,070 --> 03:23:27,550
Shoot.

2932
03:23:34,500 --> 03:23:39,220
At least they give you a little bit of wall to dodge...

2933
03:23:41,800 --> 03:23:42,760
That one.

2934
03:23:45,960 --> 03:23:48,220
Girl, if you need to...

2935
03:23:51,740 --> 03:23:52,640
Coughing baby.

2936
03:23:55,740 --> 03:23:57,080
Sorry, just making sure you remember.

2937
03:23:57,320 --> 03:23:58,060
No worries.

2938
03:23:58,960 --> 03:24:00,040
Appreciate it still.

2939
03:24:00,320 --> 03:24:00,700
Thank you.

2940
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:05,780
Thank you, thank you.

2941
03:24:06,040 --> 03:24:08,240
Oh, these machines suck.

2942
03:24:10,220 --> 03:24:12,220
These machines are pretty bad, I think.

2943
03:24:19,990 --> 03:24:22,070
Oh my god, I dodged though.

2944
03:24:22,270 --> 03:24:22,830
I...

2945
03:24:22,830 --> 03:24:24,810
I dodged.

2946
03:24:25,630 --> 03:24:29,090
I dodged.

2947
03:24:29,570 --> 03:24:34,810
See, it doesn't really help if you dodge right into the...

2948
03:24:36,670 --> 03:24:37,530
The damaku.

2949
03:24:51,800 --> 03:24:54,740
Dodge is a common phrase in these last few levels.

2950
03:24:55,980 --> 03:24:58,600
Everybody is feeling the pain.

2951
03:25:00,400 --> 03:25:01,000
Clearly.

2952
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:01,220
Clearly.

2953
03:25:10,770 --> 03:25:11,170
God.

2954
03:25:23,930 --> 03:25:24,610
What are you?

2955
03:25:26,450 --> 03:25:27,870
Oh my god, there's three of them?

2956
03:25:31,990 --> 03:25:33,270
Okay, I need the water.

2957
03:25:33,930 --> 03:25:34,710
I need...

2958
03:25:36,210 --> 03:25:36,910
Oh shit.

2959
03:25:37,070 --> 03:25:39,310
Oh my god, I just needed to not run into it.

2960
03:25:40,850 --> 03:25:41,690
And what about you?

2961
03:25:45,770 --> 03:25:46,490
I dodged!

2962
03:25:46,830 --> 03:25:48,350
You guys, I dodged!

2963
03:25:48,390 --> 03:25:49,670
I dodged!

2964
03:25:50,810 --> 03:25:53,630
I pressed dodge and I didn't go down!

2965
03:25:55,090 --> 03:25:55,730
I didn't.

2966
03:25:55,810 --> 03:25:57,030
I pressed dodge.

2967
03:25:57,130 --> 03:25:58,590
I did, I did, I did.

2968
03:26:02,720 --> 03:26:03,680
Ran straight into it.

2969
03:26:03,700 --> 03:26:05,080
Yeah, because I was trying to go down.

2970
03:26:06,320 --> 03:26:07,680
I was trying to go down.

2971
03:26:16,800 --> 03:26:18,660
Oh wait, I lost my thingy.

2972
03:26:20,300 --> 03:26:21,660
I love when that happens.

2973
03:26:27,660 --> 03:26:29,380
There was like no way getting out of that.

2974
03:26:36,760 --> 03:26:38,880
I love when they are all in one area.

2975
03:26:39,880 --> 03:26:41,680
Like, leave me alone!

2976
03:26:46,200 --> 03:26:47,820
Okay, this one over here.

2977
03:26:49,140 --> 03:26:49,780
Oh my god.

2978
03:26:49,900 --> 03:26:50,540
Oh my god.

2979
03:26:50,740 --> 03:26:50,980
Wait.

2980
03:26:50,980 --> 03:26:51,800
Okay.

2981
03:26:52,340 --> 03:26:53,520
Oh no, Metal Gear.

2982
03:27:01,210 --> 03:27:02,090
Come on!

2983
03:27:02,450 --> 03:27:03,550
Don't be like that.

2984
03:27:04,490 --> 03:27:06,250
Please be nice to me.

2985
03:27:07,130 --> 03:27:09,890
Oh, I grabbed the wrong thing?

2986
03:27:12,170 --> 03:27:13,410
I grabbed the wrong thing?

2987
03:27:14,150 --> 03:27:15,750
Oh, I'm dodging into the wall.

2988
03:27:16,550 --> 03:27:16,930
Oh my god.

2989
03:27:17,010 --> 03:27:17,330
Oh my god.

2990
03:27:17,370 --> 03:27:17,590
Oh my god.

2991
03:27:17,650 --> 03:27:18,670
Oh my god, the time limit!

2992
03:27:21,870 --> 03:27:22,810
I don't have time.

2993
03:27:23,130 --> 03:27:24,030
Oh wait, I do have time!

2994
03:27:25,050 --> 03:27:26,830
Can I live, please?

2995
03:27:36,600 --> 03:27:37,220
A clutch!

2996
03:27:50,660 --> 03:27:51,060
Yeah!

2997
03:27:51,560 --> 03:27:52,760
One second, let me...

2998
03:27:53,280 --> 03:27:54,860
Make sure I'm not being contacted.

2999
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:55,320
Okay, good.

3000
03:27:57,020 --> 03:27:57,340
Yeah!

3001
03:27:59,020 --> 03:28:00,140
Hey there, love.

3002
03:28:00,300 --> 03:28:01,380
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

3003
03:28:01,540 --> 03:28:03,280
Short, quiet, gives away pudding pies.

3004
03:28:03,440 --> 03:28:03,960
Rings a bell?

3005
03:28:06,060 --> 03:28:07,220
Cool down, old timer.

3006
03:28:08,120 --> 03:28:10,920
We didn't manage to off the new girl, if that's what you're thinking.

3007
03:28:10,920 --> 03:28:15,760
Yeah, it was Dr. Striga who got her.

3008
03:28:16,360 --> 03:28:19,040
If you hurry, you may still find them in the lower tunnels.

3009
03:28:19,120 --> 03:28:19,420
Oh no!

3010
03:28:19,580 --> 03:28:20,780
We're going to the lower tunnels!

3011
03:28:23,940 --> 03:28:25,100
Word from your boss.

3012
03:28:25,260 --> 03:28:25,420
What?

3013
03:28:26,380 --> 03:28:28,520
Can't she stay put for a single bloody day?

3014
03:28:28,980 --> 03:28:30,140
What the hell is wrong with her?

3015
03:28:30,560 --> 03:28:31,480
No, we got kidnapped!

3016
03:28:37,880 --> 03:28:38,720
Okay, guys.

3017
03:28:41,200 --> 03:28:42,980
We have three chapters left.

3018
03:28:43,820 --> 03:28:45,720
I would like to see if I can...

3019
03:28:45,720 --> 03:28:47,200
Well, I only have a half hour.

3020
03:28:47,500 --> 03:28:49,160
I would like to try to beat it today.

3021
03:28:50,120 --> 03:28:52,220
Because I don't want to play it again.

3022
03:28:52,980 --> 03:28:54,460
I have a half hour before my meeting.

3023
03:28:57,020 --> 03:28:59,820
Do you think it's okay if I play on easy for the last three?

3024
03:29:02,100 --> 03:29:03,340
So I can try and beat it?

3025
03:29:11,500 --> 03:29:11,900
Yeah?

3026
03:29:12,160 --> 03:29:13,080
Okay, thank you guys.

3027
03:29:20,490 --> 03:29:22,170
Ultra tier scrapper?

3028
03:29:23,590 --> 03:29:24,150
Oh my god.

3029
03:29:24,470 --> 03:29:25,930
Oh my god, they're fast.

3030
03:29:28,910 --> 03:29:30,390
Oh, we're already on...

3031
03:29:37,510 --> 03:29:39,370
There's everything going on at once!

3032
03:29:39,770 --> 03:29:40,570
It's like that movie!

3033
03:29:41,090 --> 03:29:41,450
Everywhere!

3034
03:29:42,070 --> 03:29:43,210
Everyone all at once!

3035
03:29:43,590 --> 03:29:45,330
Holy shit, did I have to do...

3036
03:29:45,330 --> 03:29:45,870
Oh my god.

3037
03:29:46,450 --> 03:29:47,370
Where's the water?

3038
03:29:47,530 --> 03:29:47,930
Oh my god.

3039
03:29:49,390 --> 03:29:50,990
Oh, there's no time limit.

3040
03:29:51,910 --> 03:29:53,050
God is gracious.

3041
03:29:53,290 --> 03:29:53,950
God is good.

3042
03:29:56,090 --> 03:29:57,230
Oh my god!

3043
03:29:57,650 --> 03:29:58,750
There's no time limit!

3044
03:29:59,130 --> 03:29:59,710
Thank god!

3045
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:04,600
Oh my god, I'm stuck on the wall.

3046
03:30:05,980 --> 03:30:06,920
God damn it!

3047
03:30:07,320 --> 03:30:08,100
Oh my god.

3048
03:30:08,680 --> 03:30:09,380
Oh my god.

3049
03:30:10,480 --> 03:30:11,540
Oh my god.

3050
03:30:13,080 --> 03:30:14,700
Oh, I forgot that I can dodge.

3051
03:30:14,840 --> 03:30:15,660
I'm so stupid.

3052
03:30:16,480 --> 03:30:17,740
I've been so... I was so...

3053
03:30:18,500 --> 03:30:18,920
So...

3054
03:30:21,100 --> 03:30:22,460
Do I even want...

3055
03:30:22,460 --> 03:30:22,700
Hello?

3056
03:30:22,880 --> 03:30:23,020
Hello?

3057
03:30:23,860 --> 03:30:25,040
Which is that one?

3058
03:30:25,200 --> 03:30:25,860
I'm trying...

3059
03:30:25,860 --> 03:30:27,660
Oh, I was looking at the wrong one.

3060
03:30:27,720 --> 03:30:28,140
Okay, okay.

3061
03:30:28,540 --> 03:30:29,020
This one.

3062
03:30:36,980 --> 03:30:37,400
Ouch.

3063
03:30:38,800 --> 03:30:39,660
Oh my god.

3064
03:30:40,360 --> 03:30:41,080
Not stupid.

3065
03:30:41,200 --> 03:30:41,800
Brain boiled.

3066
03:30:42,400 --> 03:30:42,800
True.

3067
03:30:43,980 --> 03:30:47,540
Oh my god, they don't even give you a second to learn anything.

3068
03:30:49,560 --> 03:30:51,180
They're like, welcome to the game.

3069
03:31:08,150 --> 03:31:09,910
Oh, I tried dodging, I did.

3070
03:31:32,580 --> 03:31:35,680
I'm so lost in the stars right now.

3071
03:31:36,540 --> 03:31:38,480
Thank god there's no time limit on these.

3072
03:31:39,820 --> 03:31:41,720
What kind of weirdos say this?

3073
03:31:42,080 --> 03:31:43,380
Please, it's not Iron Man!

3074
03:31:43,880 --> 03:31:44,760
Oh my god!

3075
03:31:47,560 --> 03:31:49,200
Oh, I thought I grabbed it though.

3076
03:31:49,700 --> 03:31:50,820
I thought I grabbed the water.

3077
03:31:52,080 --> 03:31:53,880
Oh, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.

3078
03:31:54,360 --> 03:31:56,080
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.

3079
03:31:59,200 --> 03:32:00,500
Please just fix one.

3080
03:32:00,720 --> 03:32:00,980
Please.

3081
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:05,080
I can't even fix a single thing.

3082
03:32:06,600 --> 03:32:08,040
I'm so lost.

3083
03:32:09,160 --> 03:32:09,460
Please.

3084
03:32:19,170 --> 03:32:20,250
I'm so...

3085
03:32:20,250 --> 03:32:21,150
I'm lost!

3086
03:32:22,070 --> 03:32:23,290
I'm just a girl!

3087
03:32:23,390 --> 03:32:23,630
Please!

3088
03:32:30,500 --> 03:32:31,680
I can't stop running.

3089
03:32:31,980 --> 03:32:32,900
I can't stop running.

3090
03:32:32,980 --> 03:32:33,700
I can't stop running.

3091
03:32:34,520 --> 03:32:36,120
I love no time limits.

3092
03:32:36,180 --> 03:32:36,920
I love no time limits.

3093
03:32:36,920 --> 03:32:37,960
I love no time limits.

3094
03:32:40,020 --> 03:32:41,400
I'm just a girl!

3095
03:32:52,480 --> 03:32:53,120
Look, sweetheart.

3096
03:32:53,480 --> 03:32:54,840
This is Baba Yaga.

3097
03:32:55,540 --> 03:32:57,200
The legendary tunnel runner.

3098
03:32:57,700 --> 03:32:59,900
She's supposed to be off-duty today.

3099
03:33:00,260 --> 03:33:01,520
Oh, isn't it Baba Yaga?

3100
03:33:02,260 --> 03:33:03,320
Oh, wait, I'm so confused.

3101
03:33:03,800 --> 03:33:06,560
I can't read anymore.

3102
03:33:08,860 --> 03:33:10,500
I can't read anymore.

3103
03:33:10,820 --> 03:33:12,000
Wait, look, sweetheart.

3104
03:33:12,220 --> 03:33:15,040
Isn't it Baba Yaga, the legendary tunnel runner?

3105
03:33:15,040 --> 03:33:17,680
She's supposed to be off-duty today.

3106
03:33:25,480 --> 03:33:27,280
Sylvia, you dumb bitch!

3107
03:33:27,380 --> 03:33:28,200
We had a deal!

3108
03:33:30,100 --> 03:33:31,040
Two days, Sylvia.

3109
03:33:31,340 --> 03:33:33,180
I have only two days off each year.

3110
03:33:33,460 --> 03:33:35,320
I really shouldn't be working right now.

3111
03:33:37,340 --> 03:33:37,860
Somebody...

3112
03:33:37,860 --> 03:33:38,880
Wait, where's our kisses?

3113
03:33:41,640 --> 03:33:43,080
Word from your boss.

3114
03:33:43,140 --> 03:33:44,040
Sorry about this, pup.

3115
03:33:44,040 --> 03:33:47,380
Usually I'm more successful at keeping my ghosts contained in sector A.

3116
03:33:48,000 --> 03:33:49,040
Sector A?

3117
03:33:50,380 --> 03:33:52,840
Oh, it's so embarrassing pressing easy mode.

3118
03:33:53,120 --> 03:33:53,700
I'm sorry.

3119
03:33:54,820 --> 03:33:56,920
There's nothing to block hits here.

3120
03:33:58,280 --> 03:34:00,020
It's gotta be all skill, baby.

3121
03:34:03,340 --> 03:34:03,860
OK.

3122
03:34:06,680 --> 03:34:07,200
Oh,

3123
03:34:19,560 --> 03:34:21,580
dang it, I dodged, but I think it was timed out.

3124
03:34:28,120 --> 03:34:28,900
Oh, gosh.

3125
03:34:29,360 --> 03:34:30,480
Oh, gosh, what am I missing?

3126
03:34:30,480 --> 03:34:31,000
OK, here.

3127
03:34:35,500 --> 03:34:36,680
Oh, wait, I grabbed it.

3128
03:34:36,740 --> 03:34:37,500
I grabbed the water.

3129
03:34:38,560 --> 03:34:39,020
I'm dead.

3130
03:34:46,620 --> 03:34:47,600
Oh, come on.

3131
03:34:47,680 --> 03:34:48,760
Be nice.

3132
03:34:59,860 --> 03:35:01,220
Don't be like that.

3133
03:35:13,210 --> 03:35:14,750
Don't be like that.

3134
03:35:17,050 --> 03:35:18,310
At least it's only two.

3135
03:35:18,510 --> 03:35:19,070
My god.

3136
03:35:20,010 --> 03:35:20,650
Anymore?

3137
03:35:21,270 --> 03:35:22,570
I'll literally pass out.

3138
03:35:23,910 --> 03:35:26,970
If there were any more than two, I would literally pass out.

3139
03:35:45,120 --> 03:35:45,760
Minto...

3140
03:35:45,760 --> 03:35:47,240
Minto's head.

3141
03:35:50,740 --> 03:35:51,380
Shit.

3142
03:35:53,260 --> 03:35:56,120
I grabbed that for, I guess, this reason.

3143
03:35:56,420 --> 03:35:56,880
There we go.

3144
03:36:11,420 --> 03:36:12,860
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

3145
03:36:18,900 --> 03:36:20,380
We were so close.

3146
03:36:21,380 --> 03:36:22,240
I think.

3147
03:36:22,920 --> 03:36:24,300
I think we were close.

3148
03:36:24,520 --> 03:36:25,480
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

3149
03:36:30,220 --> 03:36:32,400
This bear is too fast.

3150
03:36:32,740 --> 03:36:36,320
I actually can't tell what animal it is, because it's so...

3151
03:36:38,220 --> 03:36:39,800
It's so fast.

3152
03:36:40,240 --> 03:36:42,140
I can't tell what I'm looking at.

3153
03:36:43,020 --> 03:36:44,120
Damn animals.

3154
03:36:48,030 --> 03:36:48,490
Those...

3155
03:36:48,490 --> 03:36:49,350
Oh my god.

3156
03:36:49,850 --> 03:36:50,470
I'm gonna die.

3157
03:36:54,680 --> 03:36:55,140
Probably.

3158
03:37:00,220 --> 03:37:01,140
Oh, come on.

3159
03:37:01,200 --> 03:37:03,480
Wait, it didn't explode in the timer though.

3160
03:37:03,980 --> 03:37:05,320
I thought I was safe.

3161
03:37:06,200 --> 03:37:07,500
I thought I had the timer.

3162
03:37:08,840 --> 03:37:12,320
If I get close to it, does the timer go down more quickly or something?

3163
03:37:14,740 --> 03:37:15,220
Or...

3164
03:37:18,040 --> 03:37:18,980
Yeah, see!

3165
03:37:22,900 --> 03:37:25,600
I thought I had the timer, you sick game.

3166
03:37:26,300 --> 03:37:27,980
Oh wait, I didn't need that.

3167
03:37:30,820 --> 03:37:33,160
I grabbed this thing and I don't need it!

3168
03:37:40,550 --> 03:37:41,810
What do I do with you?

3169
03:37:48,790 --> 03:37:51,510
Game doesn't follow it's own rules, that's what I'm saying!

3170
03:37:54,290 --> 03:37:55,190
Oh my god, I'm so dead.

3171
03:37:55,370 --> 03:37:55,850
I'm so dead.

3172
03:38:00,950 --> 03:38:02,190
I guess if it's like...

3173
03:38:02,190 --> 03:38:03,150
Don't get close...

3174
03:38:03,150 --> 03:38:04,550
I don't know, I have no idea.

3175
03:38:04,710 --> 03:38:05,730
See, look at this!

3176
03:38:08,570 --> 03:38:09,770
I'm so confused!

3177
03:38:10,930 --> 03:38:11,350
Oh wait.

3178
03:38:12,190 --> 03:38:14,130
Nope, I'm not carrying it at all.

3179
03:38:19,970 --> 03:38:20,670
Ouchie, ouchie.

3180
03:38:24,770 --> 03:38:26,310
I'm forgetting what controls are.

3181
03:38:34,230 --> 03:38:35,270
Please, please.

3182
03:38:35,370 --> 03:38:36,850
Oh my god, I ran right into it!

3183
03:38:38,370 --> 03:38:39,910
I do this every time.

3184
03:38:41,710 --> 03:38:43,190
Uh oh, I'm so boned.

3185
03:38:43,870 --> 03:38:44,610
I'm so boned.

3186
03:38:45,090 --> 03:38:45,770
Oh my god!

3187
03:38:54,370 --> 03:38:56,970
It's alright guys, I believe in us.

3188
03:38:59,230 --> 03:39:00,270
I believe...

3189
03:39:00,270 --> 03:39:00,950
Oh, okay.

3190
03:39:01,310 --> 03:39:01,610
Wow.

3191
03:39:02,790 --> 03:39:04,430
You wanna tell me when you...

3192
03:39:04,430 --> 03:39:07,990
When you dash next time?

3193
03:39:07,990 --> 03:39:09,250
We know Dasher!

3194
03:39:10,450 --> 03:39:11,910
Dasher 2.0!

3195
03:39:12,470 --> 03:39:13,870
Dasher 2.0 baby!

3196
03:39:20,230 --> 03:39:21,290
Heal, heal.

3197
03:39:22,130 --> 03:39:22,730
Fixed.

3198
03:39:23,190 --> 03:39:23,810
Okay, alright.

3199
03:39:35,150 --> 03:39:36,130
Oh no no!

3200
03:39:51,870 --> 03:39:52,990
Oh come on.

3201
03:39:54,110 --> 03:39:55,470
How am I supposed to dodge that?

3202
03:40:18,720 --> 03:40:20,460
I have a battery and I don't know why.

3203
03:40:22,140 --> 03:40:23,620
I just grab things.

3204
03:40:23,820 --> 03:40:26,360
I just grab things because I think they'll be helpful.

3205
03:40:35,160 --> 03:40:36,780
Emotional support battery.

3206
03:40:38,260 --> 03:40:38,440
Oh

3207
03:40:42,020 --> 03:40:43,860
god, I got double teamed.

3208
03:41:20,110 --> 03:41:22,650
Oh, I thought that was me.

3209
03:41:23,510 --> 03:41:24,050
No!

3210
03:41:36,410 --> 03:41:37,610
Hold on.

3211
03:41:37,990 --> 03:41:40,190
Reminder on meeting in 20 minutes.

3212
03:41:40,930 --> 03:41:41,970
See you then!

3213
03:41:48,770 --> 03:41:49,370
Today

3214
03:41:52,660 --> 03:41:54,080
guys, so sad.

3215
03:41:55,840 --> 03:41:57,380
Wow, that was fast.

3216
03:41:57,880 --> 03:41:59,740
I don't think we're beating the game today you guys.

3217
03:42:03,360 --> 03:42:05,480
I'll just YouTube the ending.

3218
03:42:06,880 --> 03:42:08,040
I can't do this anymore.

3219
03:42:09,100 --> 03:42:10,900
Put me out of my misery.

3220
03:42:14,800 --> 03:42:15,460
Oh my god.

3221
03:42:15,880 --> 03:42:16,600
I'm trying.

3222
03:42:17,100 --> 03:42:17,680
Wait, where am I?

3223
03:42:19,240 --> 03:42:21,880
I can't tell when I'm doing stuff.

3224
03:42:36,640 --> 03:42:38,040
I got lost.

3225
03:42:38,720 --> 03:42:39,640
I got lost.

3226
03:42:57,680 --> 03:42:59,480
Crikey, this place is scary.

3227
03:42:59,480 --> 03:43:02,040
There we go.

3228
03:43:03,080 --> 03:43:04,600
Please, let me out.

3229
03:43:19,350 --> 03:43:22,310
It's hard when they're all getting up on me.

3230
03:43:27,410 --> 03:43:29,210
I think that's just what they're doing.

3231
03:43:29,470 --> 03:43:31,230
I dodged.

3232
03:43:31,250 --> 03:43:31,790
I dodged.

3233
03:43:32,830 --> 03:43:34,510
I dodged game.

3234
03:43:35,090 --> 03:43:35,110
Ref!

3235
03:43:35,710 --> 03:43:36,270
Ref!

3236
03:43:37,450 --> 03:43:39,150
Ref, I need you to...

3237
03:43:39,790 --> 03:43:41,530
I need you to call this one.

3238
03:43:42,030 --> 03:43:42,590
Ref!

3239
03:43:43,370 --> 03:43:43,930
Referee!

3240
03:43:45,730 --> 03:43:46,690
Where's the referee?

3241
03:43:48,310 --> 03:43:49,290
Where's the referee?

3242
03:43:53,630 --> 03:43:54,930
Where's the ref?

3243
03:44:06,730 --> 03:44:11,070
Oh my god, there's so many guys on the screen.

3244
03:44:14,470 --> 03:44:16,230
Oh, oh, oh, I already...

3245
03:44:16,230 --> 03:44:17,990
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

3246
03:44:19,330 --> 03:44:19,950
You know what?

3247
03:44:20,010 --> 03:44:20,370
Screw it.

3248
03:44:23,070 --> 03:44:24,330
There's no time limit.

3249
03:44:24,410 --> 03:44:24,930
Who cares?

3250
03:44:25,770 --> 03:44:26,590
I don't care!

3251
03:44:27,630 --> 03:44:29,110
I don't care!

3252
03:44:29,850 --> 03:44:31,390
I actually do care.

3253
03:45:03,310 --> 03:45:05,030
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3254
03:45:05,430 --> 03:45:07,050
Please, this is the last one!

3255
03:45:07,530 --> 03:45:08,270
Let me live!

3256
03:45:16,050 --> 03:45:17,390
Oh god, oh god, please.

3257
03:45:20,680 --> 03:45:22,140
I dodged!

3258
03:45:32,280 --> 03:45:34,540
Oh, I was literally spamming dodge.

3259
03:45:34,680 --> 03:45:38,400
Oh, spamming it.

3260
03:45:39,460 --> 03:45:40,980
So rude.

3261
03:45:42,900 --> 03:45:44,000
Oh gosh.

3262
03:45:48,880 --> 03:45:50,420
Oh, you bastard.

3263
03:45:50,700 --> 03:45:52,600
You ugly fucking... I'm gonna burn.

3264
03:45:52,860 --> 03:45:53,200
You know what?

3265
03:45:53,200 --> 03:45:54,460
I hate animals now too.

3266
03:45:54,960 --> 03:45:56,000
I hate everything!

3267
03:45:57,700 --> 03:45:59,120
I hate everything.

3268
03:45:59,120 --> 03:46:01,100
I've become a certified hater.

3269
03:46:02,060 --> 03:46:05,880
I've become a certified hater of all mankind!

3270
03:46:06,680 --> 03:46:08,880
All creatures of all species!

3271
03:46:09,780 --> 03:46:14,520
I hate women, and I hate animals, and I hate men, and I hate everything!

3272
03:46:14,880 --> 03:46:16,740
I think nothing should survive!

3273
03:46:23,230 --> 03:46:25,690
I hate everything equally.

3274
03:46:46,600 --> 03:46:48,120
I hate everything equally.

3275
03:46:50,240 --> 03:46:53,500
Nothing will escape my wrath.

3276
03:46:54,640 --> 03:46:56,900
This is why I'm a Yurei, you guys!

3277
03:46:57,900 --> 03:46:59,620
If you ever wondered why.

3278
03:47:03,920 --> 03:47:08,280
You're like, why is Kayako her queen?

3279
03:47:08,580 --> 03:47:10,040
Why does she want to be like Kayako?

3280
03:47:10,960 --> 03:47:11,820
Because of this.

3281
03:47:12,900 --> 03:47:15,940
No one is safe from my wrath.

3282
03:47:24,470 --> 03:47:25,350
Ouchie ouch.

3283
03:47:56,130 --> 03:47:58,310
I don't even feel like I'm comment...

3284
03:47:58,310 --> 03:48:04,050
You guys, I think I've blacked out the past 15 minutes.

3285
03:48:04,950 --> 03:48:05,910
Have I been talking?

3286
03:48:08,350 --> 03:48:08,910
I

3287
03:48:14,310 --> 03:48:15,470
was like, wait a second.

3288
03:48:15,810 --> 03:48:17,310
Am I even commenting right now?

3289
03:48:17,410 --> 03:48:19,110
Am I commentating right now?

3290
03:48:19,110 --> 03:48:21,630
Or am I going insane?

3291
03:48:22,050 --> 03:48:27,270
I can't remember anything that I've said in the past 15 minutes.

3292
03:48:27,670 --> 03:48:30,270
Oh my god!

3293
03:48:30,950 --> 03:48:32,850
I've literally blacked out.

3294
03:48:52,130 --> 03:48:53,670
I can't believe it.

3295
03:48:53,930 --> 03:48:54,810
I was like, wait a second.

3296
03:48:55,050 --> 03:48:56,490
Is this even interesting to watch?

3297
03:48:56,510 --> 03:48:57,030
Am I talking?

3298
03:48:57,650 --> 03:48:59,410
I don't know if I've been talking or not.

3299
03:49:03,620 --> 03:49:05,020
I have no idea.

3300
03:49:06,260 --> 03:49:06,860
Craziness.

3301
03:49:12,080 --> 03:49:13,320
Have I been talking?

3302
03:49:14,160 --> 03:49:14,900
At all?

3303
03:49:16,120 --> 03:49:17,640
Guys, be honest with me.

3304
03:49:20,160 --> 03:49:22,760
Oh my god, I dodged though, I dodged.

3305
03:49:24,320 --> 03:49:26,160
I dodged, I dodged.

3306
03:49:27,760 --> 03:49:30,120
I mean, like, I pressed the button to dodge.

3307
03:49:34,630 --> 03:49:35,510
Oh my gosh.

3308
03:49:37,470 --> 03:49:40,230
I'm not, like, creating any new things though.

3309
03:49:43,980 --> 03:49:46,820
Oh no, I haven't been creating things.

3310
03:49:48,040 --> 03:49:50,160
I haven't been creating things.

3311
03:49:51,000 --> 03:49:53,320
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

3312
03:49:56,360 --> 03:49:57,320
Ouchie, ouchie.

3313
03:49:58,120 --> 03:50:00,680
Oh my god, you fucker, you fucker.

3314
03:50:06,340 --> 03:50:08,280
It was more growling than talking.

3315
03:50:23,920 --> 03:50:25,500
I became Godzilla.

3316
03:50:26,940 --> 03:50:27,700
This

3317
03:50:30,800 --> 03:50:32,240
is my Godzilla impression.

3318
03:50:44,090 --> 03:50:45,530
Wait, what am I grabbing?

3319
03:50:45,770 --> 03:50:47,110
I'm running in circles.

3320
03:50:48,130 --> 03:50:50,370
I'm just running in circles now.

3321
03:50:50,750 --> 03:50:51,850
What do I need?

3322
03:50:52,090 --> 03:50:53,150
I need water.

3323
03:50:59,200 --> 03:51:02,580
I wish I could tell how many hits I had left on my little guy.

3324
03:51:02,720 --> 03:51:03,840
My little drone man.

3325
03:51:04,800 --> 03:51:05,200
Okay.

3326
03:51:14,530 --> 03:51:18,670
Oh my god, I tried to hit, or I tried to do anything.

3327
03:51:18,930 --> 03:51:21,090
Wait, I think I got hit, like, three times.

3328
03:51:22,550 --> 03:51:23,790
Drone has only one hit.

3329
03:51:24,590 --> 03:51:27,270
No, it has two, because I'm on easy mode.

3330
03:51:29,850 --> 03:51:32,290
I'm on easy mode, so it has two hits.

3331
03:51:41,950 --> 03:51:42,910
Holy shite.

3332
03:51:47,280 --> 03:51:49,120
Oh, it's one hit, but it respawns.

3333
03:51:49,620 --> 03:51:52,440
I thought it was two.

3334
03:51:53,520 --> 03:51:54,320
I see, I see.

3335
03:51:54,720 --> 03:51:55,860
Six seconds between hits.

3336
03:51:56,000 --> 03:51:58,340
I'm sorry, you guys were right.

3337
03:51:58,340 --> 03:52:00,080
I admit fault.

3338
03:52:00,800 --> 03:52:02,120
Which I do not do often.

3339
03:52:04,700 --> 03:52:06,040
I hate this.

3340
03:52:06,660 --> 03:52:07,700
What are you?

3341
03:52:08,180 --> 03:52:09,540
You're an abomination.

3342
03:52:09,860 --> 03:52:11,320
Oh my god, he's really gonna kill me.

3343
03:52:12,180 --> 03:52:13,400
I gave up, I gave up.

3344
03:52:13,880 --> 03:52:14,800
I just gave up.

3345
03:52:15,720 --> 03:52:17,900
Oh shit, this game is free?

3346
03:52:18,580 --> 03:52:19,580
Yeah, better be!

3347
03:52:20,060 --> 03:52:22,100
For the amount of rage I have!

3348
03:52:23,220 --> 03:52:25,820
You think I wanna pay for this kind of rage?

3349
03:52:29,460 --> 03:52:31,980
You think I wanna pay to be this angry?

3350
03:52:46,040 --> 03:52:46,440
Oh,

3351
03:52:57,820 --> 03:52:59,140
I was like...

3352
03:52:59,140 --> 03:53:00,040
Oh, am I...

3353
03:53:00,040 --> 03:53:02,620
You guys are so...

3354
03:53:05,580 --> 03:53:09,460
Guys, I think this might be it for me.

3355
03:53:09,600 --> 03:53:11,520
I think this might be...

3356
03:53:12,320 --> 03:53:13,480
Last try.

3357
03:53:14,260 --> 03:53:15,000
Last round.

3358
03:53:15,820 --> 03:53:17,220
Last round for Minta.

3359
03:53:20,560 --> 03:53:21,640
Oh my god.

3360
03:53:22,660 --> 03:53:23,300
Please.

3361
03:53:26,220 --> 03:53:29,760
Maybe if I just focus on one side...

3362
03:53:29,760 --> 03:53:30,660
You know what I mean?

3363
03:53:36,830 --> 03:53:38,130
Actually, I don't think I can.

3364
03:53:43,380 --> 03:53:44,040
Oh my gosh.

3365
03:53:54,010 --> 03:53:56,130
I heard all those little bunnies break.

3366
03:53:56,770 --> 03:53:58,310
Your little fragile bunny bones.

3367
03:53:59,910 --> 03:54:00,950
Die bunnies.

3368
03:54:01,470 --> 03:54:02,330
Die bunnies.

3369
03:54:03,210 --> 03:54:05,470
And your little fragile bunny bones.

3370
03:54:05,710 --> 03:54:06,250
Bones.

3371
03:54:07,070 --> 03:54:08,030
Become bones.

3372
03:54:08,230 --> 03:54:09,070
Ouch, nevermind.

3373
03:54:09,650 --> 03:54:11,950
He didn't like that one, but he was the chosen one.

3374
03:54:12,410 --> 03:54:14,490
The strongest bunny.

3375
03:54:17,250 --> 03:54:18,890
The strongest bunny.

3376
03:54:21,410 --> 03:54:22,430
Oh my god.

3377
03:54:23,210 --> 03:54:24,870
I can't do anymore, you guys.

3378
03:54:24,950 --> 03:54:25,750
I can't do anymore.

3379
03:54:25,750 --> 03:54:28,450
I can't do it.

3380
03:54:28,910 --> 03:54:30,270
I can't do it.

3381
03:54:31,070 --> 03:54:32,210
I'm too weak.

3382
03:54:32,890 --> 03:54:33,850
I'm too weak.

3383
03:54:39,300 --> 03:54:40,560
I'm so frustrated.

3384
03:54:41,660 --> 03:54:42,760
But that's okay.

3385
03:54:43,640 --> 03:54:44,640
Maybe next time.

3386
03:54:46,920 --> 03:54:48,220
Maybe next time.

3387
03:54:50,740 --> 03:54:51,780
You still did great tonight.

3388
03:54:51,880 --> 03:54:52,600
Good luck at your meeting.

3389
03:54:52,780 --> 03:54:53,480
Thank you!

3390
03:54:54,560 --> 03:54:55,480
You're almost done, yeah?

3391
03:54:55,560 --> 03:54:56,920
But I have a meeting in five minutes.

3392
03:54:56,940 --> 03:54:57,420
It's okay.

3393
03:54:57,420 --> 03:55:00,420
If I didn't have a meeting, of course I would keep going.

3394
03:55:01,920 --> 03:55:05,060
But since I have a meeting, I have to give up.

3395
03:55:05,780 --> 03:55:07,000
I have to give up.

3396
03:55:07,400 --> 03:55:08,100
It's important.

3397
03:55:34,450 --> 03:55:39,110
If only I had switched the controller sooner and beat that other level faster.

3398
03:55:40,290 --> 03:55:42,610
Then I could have probably beat it.

3399
03:55:44,570 --> 03:55:45,090
Maybe.

3400
03:55:47,650 --> 03:55:48,650
So frustrating.

3401
03:55:50,770 --> 03:55:51,670
So frustrating.

3402
03:56:03,050 --> 03:56:04,530
I was like, what's in my drink?

3403
03:56:04,570 --> 03:56:06,410
I forgot I put raspberries in it.

3404
03:56:07,010 --> 03:56:09,150
I was like, ew, my drink is moldy.

3405
03:56:15,310 --> 03:56:17,630
I don't think I'll play the game again though.

3406
03:56:17,950 --> 03:56:18,390
Sorry.

3407
03:56:18,890 --> 03:56:21,850
I don't feel like playing it just for two levels, honestly.

3408
03:56:25,390 --> 03:56:26,570
But, you know.

3409
03:56:32,900 --> 03:56:34,460
Thank you guys for watching.

3410
03:56:37,100 --> 03:56:38,220
Thank you.

3411
03:56:39,800 --> 03:56:40,940
Still a fun ride.

3412
03:56:41,000 --> 03:56:41,840
It is a fun game.

3413
03:56:42,380 --> 03:56:43,260
I like this level.

3414
03:56:44,780 --> 03:56:46,120
I like this level.

3415
03:56:46,420 --> 03:56:47,980
And I liked the previous level.

3416
03:56:48,980 --> 03:56:52,680
These levels, after that one girl...

3417
03:56:53,320 --> 03:56:55,440
I don't even care to remember her name.

3418
03:56:56,440 --> 03:56:58,140
After that, though.

3419
03:56:58,700 --> 03:57:00,220
You know, after I switched the controller.

3420
03:57:00,580 --> 03:57:01,780
Because it's so much more smooth.

3421
03:57:03,840 --> 03:57:05,280
Oh god.

3422
03:57:05,420 --> 03:57:06,580
They're calling me.

3423
03:57:07,220 --> 03:57:08,380
Osaminto, everybody!

3424
03:57:09,000 --> 03:57:09,740
Thank you!

3425
03:57:11,560 --> 03:57:13,520
I will see you guys later!

3426
03:57:14,240 --> 03:57:15,780
Bye bye!

3427
03:57:16,400 --> 03:57:16,980
See you!

3428
03:57:17,540 --> 03:57:18,160
Bye bye!
