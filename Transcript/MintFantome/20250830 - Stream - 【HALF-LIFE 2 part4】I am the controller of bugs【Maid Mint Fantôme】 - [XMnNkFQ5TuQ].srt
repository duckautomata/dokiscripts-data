1
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,230
Never fear.

2
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,450
Miki is here.

3
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,950
Hello everybody.

4
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,450
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

5
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,050
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

6
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,490
How am I feeling?

7
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,730
I'm feeling okay.

8
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,090
My nose is a little bunny.

9
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,110
Um, uh...

10
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,790
And, uh...

11
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,750
Um...

12
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,290
Yeah.

13
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,590
Yeah.

14
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,610
But we're back with a more Half-Life 2.

15
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,650
What part are we on?

16
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,250
Four?

17
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,390
Yes.

18
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,490
I move my...

19
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,170
I move the game screen.

20
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,830
Four, we're on part four!

21
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,330
Yeah!

22
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,660
Oh, today might be a little more chill.

23
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,760
I am feeling a little icky.

24
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,840
And tomorrow I want to stream a lot.

25
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,580
Thank you so much for the podcast.

26
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,700
Thank you.

27
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,600
Yeah, we are in the prison area.

28
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,460
We just made it to prison, baby.

29
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,900
And, uh...

30
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,660
Yeah.

31
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,120
We just...

32
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,340
It shows this area, but we have been past this for quite some time.

33
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,620
I think this was like a super duper.

34
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,520
long chapter.

35
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
Zoopy, lopey.

36
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,260
Welcome to my book, chapter.

37
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,840
I cure.

38
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,600
Yeah, I'm gonna have to remember how to... Oh gosh.

39
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,480
I always have to remember.

40
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,060
There's so many more weapons now.

41
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,220
I don't know which buttons are what?

42
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,060
Two, three, five, seven.

43
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,260
Up, down, up, down.

44
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,260
A, B, start.

45
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,700
Are you in prison for being illegally cute?

46
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,620
No, I'm in prison.

47
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,840
for illegal crimes.

48
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,720
Death.

49
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,500
You know.

50
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,140
Yeah, I'm suddenly feeling so tired.

51
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,540
Well, maybe it's this, it's this calming like waves and the birds and the wind.

52
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:47,200
Even though this area was not calm at all, we got attacked by a big old flying thingy.

53
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,520
This ASMR is so nice though.

54
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,980
What if we just did this?

55
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,180
What if I just fell asleep?

56
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,620
Yeah, I have a dabbing stream.

57
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,580
We dead.

58
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,520
First, we thought about the chest.

59
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,500
Thank you!

60
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Were they cute murders or caused by cuteness?

61
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,880
Murder can be cute.

62
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,560
Coin it.

63
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,120
Make that my trademark phrase.

64
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:52,740

66
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,940

68
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,860
Minky Cursor.

69
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,940
Someone posted it on Twitter.

70
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,880
Someone reposted it on Twitter, too.

71
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,320
I think if you asked somebody, they would know.

72
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,400
Drop Ted Gorgeous.

73
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,220
Oh my goodness, I think we're...

74
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,140
I think we're getting a little crazy, though.

75
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,540
Half-life, so 40 years.

76
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,220
45?

77
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,990
Ah, heart-stealing thief.

78
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,170
I've also been sneezing a lot today, so I hope I don't sneeze too much for you guys.

79
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,730
If at all.

80
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,430
Yeah, I sound like a sickie, don't I?

81
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,110
Oh, gosh.

82
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,170
I sound like a sickie.

83
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,770
But I think we should just get into it.

84
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:13,010

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,400
You guys are kind of freaking me out, I'm not gonna lie.

87
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:46,980
Oh,

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,230

89
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,490
Okay.

90
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,730
And then I can throw.

91
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,050
Oh my gosh, they're loud.

92
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,050
Keep turning them down.

93
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,550
Okay, well, we came in from over here.

94
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,010
We can...

95
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,530
Wow, they all grew back!

96
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,930
What's in here?

97
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,770
Nothing.

98
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,050
Oh.

99
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,130
Are you good?

100
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,750
My little babies.

101
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,810
And then, um, maybe I go over here.

102
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:28,490
Nope.

103
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,930
Maybe I go over...

104
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,150
Oh!

105
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,070
This looks more likely.

106
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,410
Get out of the way, babies!

107
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,650
Get out of the way, babies!

108
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,170
Go, my babies!

109
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,190
Go!

110
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,810
Oh, my babies!

111
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,070
Oh!

112
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,170
Oh!

113
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,670
Oh!

114
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,550
Where were they shooting from me from?

115
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,630
It was even a mystery.

116
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,890
I think they got got, though.

117
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,930
Oh, never mind.

118
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,470
Just kidding.

119
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,510
Just kidding.

120
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,550
They did not.

121
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,690
Get got.

122
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,870
I got an achievement.

123
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,530
Bug hunt.

124
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,790
Use the ant lions to kill 50 enemies.

125
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,950
Oh no.

126
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,490
Oh no, Babies!

127
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,030
Babies, we need to go!

128
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,690
Babies, we need to go!

129
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,070
Babies!

130
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,070
Babies!

131
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,110
Babies, it's time to leave!

132
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,470
Oh my gosh, wait, do I have a...

133
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,830
This thing?

134
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,570
I have three.

135
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,270
Oh, wow, wow, wow!

136
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,570
I think I took them out?

137
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,170
No, I didn't.

138
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,070
Keep going, keep going!

139
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,050
Nice shooting.

140
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,110
Thank you.

141
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,550
Oh my gosh.

142
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,070
Oh my gosh.

143
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:05,800
I need to help them.

144
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,330
Everything's happening all at once.

145
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,350
I'm scared.

146
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,190
I'm so scared.

147
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,510
Wait.

148
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,790
Why can't I get this guy?

149
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,610
Oh my

150
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,230
gosh.

151
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:26,930
Hi baby.

152
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,370
One single baby.

153
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,590
Everything's happened.

154
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,470
I just started.

155
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,690
Oh my gosh.

156
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:34,970
Ouchie.

157
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,150
Ouch.

158
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:35,410
Ouch.

159
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,590
Ouch.

160
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,790
I have no more app.

161
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,870
Oh, there's two of them.

162
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,230
What the hell?

163
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,790
When does there become two of them?

164
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,130
Okay, we need to go inside, babies.

165
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:43,890
It's time to leave.

166
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,350
Oh my gosh.

167
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,110
How do I get in there?

168
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,990
Okay.

169
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,550
Okay, we're fine.

170
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,650
Everything's okay.

171
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,730
Ah!

172
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,510
Shut the door!

173
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,210
Reload!

174
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,720
No, my babies!

175
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,300
They're dying one by one!

176
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,620
We're gonna quick save here, since I'm scared.

177
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,640
When heaven's divine!

178
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,320
Okay, okay.

179
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,010
Pass me, though, did you dirty by leaving you here?

180
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,110
She didn't know!

181
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,970
She didn't know!

182
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,230
She couldn't have known!

183
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,670
Run, babies!

184
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,530
Babies, run!

185
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,650
Run, babies!

186
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,570
Babies, we need to get out of here!

187
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,690
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

188
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,950
Holy hell!

189
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,150
I think I'm just supposed to run or something!

190
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,150
I don't know anymore!

191
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:12,910
AHHHHH!

192
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,330
What is that?

193
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:16,930
That's a man!

194
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,110
Okay.

195
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,790
Holy hell.

196
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,810
Just keep going, just keep going, just keep going!

197
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,620
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

198
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Nowhere is safe!

199
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,200
This

200
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:52,860
guy.

201
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,000
Wait, is this my rocket?

202
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,820
No, this is my grenade.

203
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,140
I have two!

204
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,100
Only two!

205
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,780
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

206
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,260
Oh, I died.

207
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,430
Okay, let's get this back out.

208
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,050
I have two?

209
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,430
I have two of them.

210
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,750
Oh my gosh.

211
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,750
Um, nice!

212
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,940
This is a little ins... I'm stuck on the door.

213
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,760
And I get stuck on my babies too.

214
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,420
Oh my gosh, I'm taking every freaking hit.

215
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,980
Did that take out one?

216
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,800
I hope so.

217
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,580
I sure hope so.

218
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,620
Wait, wrong thing!

219
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,160
No, I didn't!

220
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,020
Oh my god!

221
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,560
Oh my god!

222
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,180
Go, my babies!

223
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:00,620
Go!

224
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,420
Run!

225
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,360
Grab them!

226
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,480
Eat them!

227
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,040
Oh, wait, there's health in here.

228
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,380
This is a safe zone.

229
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,920
This is safe.

230
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,560
This is safe.

231
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:08,940
I think.

232
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,700
I think this is safe.

233
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,160
Ah!

234
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,360
Ammo box.

235
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,740
Wait, I don't think I saw one.

236
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,200
Now I'm gonna save right here?

237
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,000
the ammo box in here?

238
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,400
Oh, upstairs, okay.

239
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,380
Oh, I'm trying, I'm trying to run.

240
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,200
Oh, okay, awesome.

241
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,920
Oh, this guy.

242
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,200
No, wait, ammo box upstairs.

243
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:12,240
Uh, uh, uh, I don't see it.

244
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,220
To my right.

245
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,660
Okay, okay, okay, thank you guys.

246
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,870
Select the...

247
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,550
Am I right?

248
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,310
Am I blocked?

249
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,190
Is it good?

250
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,030
Guys?

251
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,610
I just passed it.

252
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh, I see it!

253
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,240
Ah, sorry.

254
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,300
I see it.

255
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,880
I see it.

256
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,280
I see it.

257
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,840
I see it.

258
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,700
Okay.

259
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,660
Okay.

260
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,430
Oh my god, there's no good place to hide.

261
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:07,650
Okay.

262
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,850
Okay.

263
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,130
Get

264
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,640
trapped on my babies!

265
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,660
Please, please more and more and more.

266
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,020
Ah shit.

267
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,340
I don't know if it hit.

268
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,680
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

269
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,620
Oh damn, I think you shot it down.

270
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,280
Gosh.

271
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,500
I'm gonna die!

272
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,720
I'm not gonna make it.

273
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,740
I'm not gonna make it for real.

274
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,020
Oh.

275
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,800
Okay, I know where it is now though, so I don't need to waste time with it, you know?

276
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,840
I know where it is, so I don't need to run around and be silly.

277
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,340
Okay, did they get those guys up there?

278
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,500
I'm running as

279
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,510
fast as I can!

280
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,470
Oh my gosh.

281
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,930
Holy shit.

282
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,770
Please hit.

283
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,550
I think that hit.

284
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:48,670
Somehow.

285
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,350
Somehow I think that hit.

286
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,670
Oh my god, I don't think that hit though.

287
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,150
It's going crazy.

288
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:01,950
Ah!

289
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,220
Did you see it?

290
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,100
Just be like...

291
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,240
Everywhere in those stuff.

292
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,730
I'm trying to make use of these guys to attack.

293
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,100
No, please.

294
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,820
Shotgun.

295
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,700
Oh my god, don't do that.

296
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,200
Why would you do that?

297
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,180
I wish, though, that it was safe in here, but it's not.

298
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,600
I wish I could run.

299
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,460
I wish I could run, but I can't.

300
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,660
Oh my gosh, ouch, ouch.

301
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:14,860
Please.

302
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,260
Please.

303
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,820
Take him out.

304
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Take him out.

305
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,340
Take him out.

306
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:19,720
Take him out.

307
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,240
Take him out.

308
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,740
Take him out.

309
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,460
Ouch,

310
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,180
ouch.

311
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,520
Ouch.

312
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:35,620
Ouch.

313
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,380
Oh my god.

314
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,660
Okay, we got one.

315
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,720
Save.

316
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,220
Save.

317
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,200
Yeah, you're purring, you're purring, you're so happy.

318
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,120
Me too.

319
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,040
Is that more?

320
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,260
That's true.

321
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:02,700
Ah!

322
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,380
Somehow we did it.

323
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,180
What a start to the stream.

324
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,860
I know.

325
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,820
I know.

326
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,360
Really could have used the warning.

327
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:39,870
Coming up.

328
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,090
It's going to be a news.

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,080
Oh, there's there's C, C, C.

333
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,460
Wish I could find stuff for my suit.

Okay.

335
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,900

Oh.

This is not even used all the way.

339
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,080
I'm too good.

340
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,410
What are these sounds?

341
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,700
Where you lead, we will prevail.

342
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,680
Venser Amos, bug bus.

343
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,180
Oh, there was a grenade there.

344
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,200
Hidden.

345
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,020
Secret.

346
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,980
I'm hearing all sorts of noises.

347
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,200
Nothing here either.

348
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,420
Okay, we continue.

349
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,740
Continue onwards.

350
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,340
Ah.

351
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,040
Okay.

Wow, that was really exciting.

353
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,520
Wasn't it everyone?

354
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,780
This doesn't look so good.

355
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,280
My baby's gonna come in?

356
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,720
Deploy sterilizing.

357
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,240
Interceptive infection block.

358
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,920
A5, A7, B2.

359
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,200
Babies!

360
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,560
Are they gonna come in?

361
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,040
I need to call them.

362
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,080
How do I call them again?

363
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,200
I know I shake the ball.

364
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,720
Oh, like that.

365
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,440
I squeeze it.

366
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,700
I give it a good little squeeze.

367
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,800
Come on in, babies!

368
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,020
Bug boss!

369
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,220
Danya, thank you so much for nine months!

370
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,340
Minto is bug mommy now.

371
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,800
It's Matoru the papa.

372
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,440
Yeah!

373
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,260

00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,020
Thank you so much for the tag you have to thank you!

375
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,560
Okay, all right, now we're safe.

376
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,220

Ew, it's so squishy.

380
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,940
They're not coming with me.

381
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,800

382
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,920

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,960

390
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,070
Sorry, I know what I'm saying.

391
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,350

392
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,870
Maybe Brigade will come again?

393
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,590
Why are there dead people?

394
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,110
Gosh, I keep having to turn up and down the volume.

395
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,370
Just let me know if it's like a little too much sometimes.

396
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,310
Or too little.

397
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,990
You can say.

398
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,530
I'm scared!

399
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,750
I need to get in there.

400
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,130
Maybe?

401
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,770
I don't know if I want to be in there actually.

402
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,190
Hello, old man!

403
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,350
I'm looking for the girl's father, no?

404
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,470
I believe is the case here?

405
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,910
Looking for that girl's father.

406
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,350
None of these even have beds in them.

407
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,650
It sucks.

408
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,010
It's so scary.

409
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,450
I don't like it.

410
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:49,950
Oh!

411
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,670
Jail break!

412
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,670
This will be me.

413
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,010
Oh my gosh.

414
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,870
Oh!

415
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,250
Oh!

416
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,410
You hear all this?

417
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,150
Sorry, I'm gonna be safe, scumming like crazy here, I feel.

418
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,630
Sorry.

419
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,930
I'm scared.

420
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,570
I'm scared.

421
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:26,970
Oh?

422
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:31,370
Oh?

423
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,890
Wait, was that a turret?

424
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,790
That's something we haven't had in these games at all as turrets.

425
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,120
It has to be, yeah.

426
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,420
I think it's killing little head crabs.

427
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,750
Did it get through?

428
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,750
Oh wow!

429
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,430
Wait, are those my babies?

430
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,390
No, sir!

431
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,770
Why are those my babies?

432
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,770
Do these things still get taken out by a...

433
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,040
By a shoddy?

434
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,420
My babies!

435
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,700
Can I open this?

436
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,280
Oh.

437
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh.

438
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm just...

439
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,400
I just picked it up.

440
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,520
Oh, there's another one upstairs.

441
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,540
Oh, but I think it also just got shut down.

442
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,480
Babies?

443
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,880
They should come back, no?

444
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,960
My babies.

445
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:58,840
My babies.

446
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,700
E works on turrets.

447
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,180
That's so...

448
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,100
I could just...

449
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,360
I could just pick them up.

450
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,520
Oh, there's more.

457
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,840
Who is that?

458
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,640
Oh, it's a turret from...

459
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,900
A turret with the best eyes in the world.

460
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,080
Oh, oh, we're here.

461
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,440
We're here.

462
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,360
Okay, I imagine there will probably be like something to unlock all the gates, right?

463
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,000
Like probably that?

464
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,180
Okay.

465
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,980
Oh, gosh.

466
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,320
Oh, wait.

467
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,020
Oh, no, this is a...

468
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,580
Okay.

469
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,550
Oh,

470
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,690
don't kill them.

471
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,210
They're sweet.

472
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,510
Wait, wait, wait.

473
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,100
That one's mine, right?

474
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,900
Did I burst that?

475
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,520
I like how you can just hear him walking away like a dog.

476
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,200
Is that mine?

477
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,780
Oh.

478
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,920
I think you'd recall.

479
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,620
I don't know.

480
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,730
There was one time I...

481
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,230
What was it?

482
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,530
It was a...

483
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:18,790
I read a story about like a koala in a zoo.

484
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,150
And koalas are not very bright.

485
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:28,910
The koala was given another baby to put on its back.

486
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,810
Like from a different koala, and he was just like, I guess that's mine.

487
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,870
Like, yeah, okay.

488
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,810
Sounds about right.

489
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,890
Wait, the big guy, that's not...

490
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,570
It's not going to be a problem, is it?

491
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,110
Do I have to have, like, shared ownership of my children?

492
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,450
Is that what we're doing now?

493
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,530
Uh, wait, gravity gun.

494
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,170
Which one is...

495
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:00,930
Uh, shoot.

496
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,990
There we go.

497
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,250
Oh, I just saw them right there.

498
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,550
Oh my god.

499
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,330
Oh, wait.

500
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,110
That would have been bad.

501
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,210
Had they been on?

502
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,710
Oh, gee.

503
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:18,330
That's right.

504
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,410
Thank you for the reminder.

505
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,890
Yes, I forgot that I can press G to just automatically switch to it.

506
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:23,810
Thank you.

507
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,190
Thank you.

508
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,540

509
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:42,840

515
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,220
What's in this water?

516
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,380
I know there's somebody.

517
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,080
Oh!

518
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,720
Oops.

519
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,980

520
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:47,940
Ah!

521
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:49,380
Ah!

522
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,700
Something's picking me up.

523
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:57,380
Oh, good thing I completely noticed These guys.

524
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,020
Beforehand.

525
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,100
They're so gross.

526
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,340
Let's get the other guy.

527
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,120
Ah!

528
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,200
Ah!

529
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,140
I got the other guy.

530
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,720
Let's get the third guy.

531
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,710
That's right.

532
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,990
That's right.

533
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,890
Totally, totally planned.

534
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,720
Oh my gosh!

535
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,060
No!

536
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,860
More of them?

537
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,100
I think I got them.

538
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,400
I can't hear what she's saying.

539
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,700
Is it something about me?

540
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,580
Okay.

541
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,740
I save again.

542
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:14,980
Okay.

543
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,140
My babies?

544
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,380
There should be more of my babies.

545
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:24,840
Where are they?

546
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,120
Okay, I can either park or...

547
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,660
Who's making that sound?

548
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,100
Where at?

549
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,080
Wait, I think I heard him.

550
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,280
We saw him?

551
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,160
No soup!

552
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:41,320
Oh!

553
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,740
Ow!

554
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,920
Okay.

555
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,100
Soup in here.

556
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,820
I guess I can go down.

557
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,760
But I'm scared too.

558
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,140
Because I got these guys before.

559
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:04,940
Yes, I did.

560
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,840
Yes, siri.

561
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,400
Where are my babies?

562
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,860
Nobody in here?

563
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,440
Not a single guy?

564
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,180
Does this prison even hold anybody?

565
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,600
Being so extra cautious because I'm scared, you guys.

566
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,420
I'm scared, right?

567
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,400
Please.

568
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,340
I thought that today was going to be a chill with my babies.

569
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,380
Can I get it?

570
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,340
Oh, there's two of them.

571
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,180
Oh!

572
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,390
Oh, okay, okay.

573
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,210
I got the memo.

574
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,170
I got the memo.

575
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,130
I'll go down.

576
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,830
Or I could...

577
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,610
Um, let's see.

578
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,550
What else can I shoot at them?

579
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,250
Maybe I can grenade it.

580
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,510
No, well, what's up?

581
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,730
What else we got?

582
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,430
I can just...

583
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:06,690
Oops!

584
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,690
That was a waste.

585
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,490
Throw a barrel!

586
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,990
Wait, that's so smart!

587
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,170
Okay, close.

588
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,070
Close.

589
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:22,610
Okay.

590
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,330
I think I got him.

591
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,690
No, I didn't.

592
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,010
Come here, you.

593
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,770
Wait, I actually got one!

594
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,730
That's fun.

595
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:40,950
Okay, you, come here.

596
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:43,970
Woo!

597
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,500
That's exciting.

598
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,840
That's so fun, actually.

599
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,280
What's in there?

600
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,540
Oh, let's not have that as my thing.

601
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:57,760
Okay.

602
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,220
Okay, we got a lot going on.

603
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,880
A lot to check out and around and about.

604
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,780
So let's see.

605
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,900
What do we have in here?

606
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,700
Not quite anything, huh?

607
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,200
Okay.

608
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,460
Really?

609
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,000
Not even, like, supplies?

610
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,080
Nothing?

611
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,840
My babies?

612
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,720
Come from nowhere?

613
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,480
Yeah, I need to make use of the...

614
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,580
I think I use the gravity gun in, like, ways that seem too...

615
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,160
What's the word?

616
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,340
Like, too easy, in a way.

617
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,780
Need to be a little more creative with the gravity gun.

618
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,240
I like it.

619
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,920
Okay, left in here.

620
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,450
Where are my babies?

621
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,830
It's a great question.

622
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,570
I was looking around because I thought something was walking downstairs, but it was me tripping over that.

623
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,350
Oh, that's just to the lights.

624
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,630
Oh, hello.

625
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,230
Not through here.

626
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,670
Use a scientist's brain.

627
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,310
Okay.

628
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:24,650
Exactly.

629
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,850
Nothing over here?

630
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,170
There's no supplies at all around here.

631
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,030
It's kind of crazy.

632
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:36,730
The radiator heaters on the wall...

633
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,890
I didn't... I see I saw them, but I didn't know if I could take them off the wall.

634
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:42,870
Good to know.

635
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,710
Thank you.

636
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:46,730
Congrats on 101010.

637
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,670
Gokuchi, goku, goku, goku.

638
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,990
Raging 200k!

639
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:49,390
Wow!

640
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,470
Thank you!

641
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:51,810
Oh my gosh!

642
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,610
I didn't even know...

643
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,150
Tis!

644
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,730
Thank you, everybody.

645
00:42:59,070 --> 00:42:59,870
Thank you, Nate.

646
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,370
Thank you.

647
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,050
I should have used my crowbar for him.

648
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,690
Not worth it.

649
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,050
Not worth the...

650
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:12,250
I saw even the box moving.

651
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,650
Who were you fooling?

652
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,230
Huh?

653
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,790
Who are you fooling?

654
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:19,970
Whoa.

655
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:21,150
Whoa.

656
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:26,870
It's quiet.

657
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:28,990
It's quiet.

658
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,270
This looks like a boss area.

659
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,090
I feel like I just fought a boss with those two planes, though.

660
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,230
Wait, is this where they play B-ball?

661
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:56,550
Nice.

662
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,800
Good senses.

663
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,640
Yeah, I think.

664
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,860
It's just really...

665
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,420
Oh, no.

666
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,740
Oh, no, no.

667
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,480
I'm scared.

668
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,770
It's time for what?

669
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,870
Gravity gun is good in this fight.

670
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,090
Soup.

671
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,650
Be brave.

672
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,510
I don't know why I'm such a little baby today.

673
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,330
Oh, yeah.

674
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,690
Okay.

675
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:24,990
I'm just looking at what all the numbers and everything that I have what was this one again can't remember shotgun crossbow grab gun okay being a baby is a survival tactic I guess so okay

676
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,110
Assault rifle.

677
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,130
Oh, that's right.

678
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:32,530
Okay.

679
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,460
Let's go back to my shoddy and then grab gun and shoddy.

680
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,170
Okay.

681
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,130
I'm just gonna be brave.

682
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,970
Let's go.

683
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,010
I'm one of you!

684
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,050
I'm one of you.

685
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:50,970
I'm one of you?

686
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,310
You like me.

687
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:55,710
No, you don't.

688
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,800
Oh, he broke my stov.

689
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,210
Oops, that's not what I meant to do.

690
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,480
Holy shit!

691
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,960
Ouch!

692
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,680
Holy moly!

693
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,260
Uh-oh.

694
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,040
Oh, we kind of like...

695
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,740
Oh.

696
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,040
Holy cow.

697
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,220
Uh, uh, come back, come back.

698
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,800
I gotta, like, get him off guard.

699
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,360
Oh my gosh.

700
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,060
Oh, I got him.

701
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:53,420
Nice.

702
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,760
Like, when he charges.

703
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,860
Oh, I was too early.

704
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,780
Oh, I don't know if that worked or not.

705
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:11,940
Ouch!

706
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,040
Ouch!

707
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,760
I couldn't run.

708
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,460
I was trying.

709
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,460
Oh, shit.

710
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,000
Wait, did I get him?

711
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,060
Woo!

712
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,340
First try?

713
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,380
Wait, you like me?

714
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,580
You like me, you like me.

715
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:37,640
Yippee!

716
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,920
Okay, I lost quite a bit, but there were some...

717
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,060
There was some, what's it called?

718
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,140
On the other side.

719
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,360
Grab gun for the win?

720
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:44,920
Wow.

721
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:49,320
Thank you to whoever suggested that.

722
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,080
Nice.

723
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,620
I got my babies back.

724
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,580
I got my babies back, back, back.

725
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:05,410
What's in here?

726
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,290
Would this be a little break from the guy?

727
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,030
Live custody battle.

728
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,890
Yeah, that's what I thought was gonna happen.

729
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,930
Oh, there's maybe over here.

730
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,390
Oh, dang, there were toilets.

731
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,440
I might be the greatest gamer of all time.

732
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:43,170
Guys?

733
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:46,630
Is this what the men's bathroom looks like?

734
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,570
Even when you poo, you have no doors?

735
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,270
It's kind of sad.

736
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,710
If you say so.

737
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,780
You make eye contact.

738
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,500
That was kind of fun.

739
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,900
You're never lonely, right?

740
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,860
I got to save all my shoddy ammo, too.

741
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:12,520
It was so good.

742
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,700
I'm guessing I go through here.

743
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,100
I don't see anything else, though, which is kind of sad.

744
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:22,980
Hello, baby.

745
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,070
The sinks are where we pee.

746
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,410
Oh, from above it really did look like basketball.

747
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:37,790
Okay.

748
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,890
I don't think there was anything else, sadly.

749
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,410
Hold on, I'm going to go look.

750
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:43,530
Competitive peeing.

751
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:49,170
I mean, I haven't not heard of that.

752

00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:33,990
Stunky.

Oh!

794
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,060
Oh my gosh.

795
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,640
I'm trying to...

796
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,280
Oh, I don't even know what's happening here.

797
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,500
Oh, gosh.

798
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:05,720
Okay.

799
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,120
I have to go around.

800
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,100
This way.

801
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,600
Oh, that's me!

802
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,640
Don't shoot at me!

803
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,080
Ah!

804
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,960
Is there a guy in here?

805
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:21,820
Oh!

806
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:22,900
From where?

807
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,740
I don't see him.

808
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,720
Oh, it's a turret again.

809
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,320
Hello.

810
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,340
My babies!

811
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,500
Watch out.

812
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,880
Watch out, everybody.

813
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,720
I can't see anything.

814
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,240
Okay, we go in here.

815
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,620
How is Delta?

816
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,400
I hope you had a good time.

817
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,180
Oh, it's so much fun!

818
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:52,200
No, I think even the graphics, everything looks really good.

819
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:52,820
Yeah.

820
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,220
What's that sound?

821
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,320
Something's revving up.

822
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,100
What is that?

823
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,380
What's in?

824
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,280
What's...

825
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,060
What's...

826
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,440
I see something there?

827
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:33,590
What are they doing to him?

828
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:35,010
No!

829
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,570
What are you...

830
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,910
What are you guys doing to him?

831
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:40,370
Uh...

832
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:44,890
One second.

833
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,370
Is that our friend?

834
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:55,710
Oh!

835
00:54:58,450 --> 00:54:58,890
No.

836
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,030
No.

837
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:02,190
No.

838
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:06,860
No.

839
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:07,860
Our friend.

840
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,100
Our friend.

841
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,120
I think I got everything.

842
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:12,860
Let's just keep going.

843
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,330
I opened something.

844
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:21,990
Oh my gosh.

845
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:22,570
My babies.

846
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:23,410
I need to...

847
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:23,990
Okay.

848
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,250
I'll take the other door.

849
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:26,430
You're so right.

850
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:28,970
This is fine.

851
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:30,550
We'll just take the other way.

852
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:33,730
Okay.

853
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:38,030
I was hoping that would be...

854
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:40,630
Babies?

855
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:43,550
Babies?

856
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,430
One moment.

857
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:45,050
Whoa.

858
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:46,690
What's happening to you?

859
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,850
It's turning into a heartless.

860
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:51,270
What just happened?

861
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:52,790
Who exploded?

862
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:58,950
Oh, come on!

863
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,570
I was gonna do this properly!

864
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,160
Oh my gosh.

865
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,000
Did you mean to do that?

866
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:13,380
Ow!

867
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:13,740
Ow!

868
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,040
Ow!

869
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,220
Go, babies!

870
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:16,580
Go!

871
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,720
You got this.

872
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,000
Oops.

873
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,180
I don't know why I thought that.

874
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,370
What is...

875
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:33,610
What is that?

876
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,010
Oh!

877
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,690
They'll handle it.

878
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,080
Is it downstairs?

879
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,020
No.

880
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:14,800
Hmm.

881
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,660
Oh, I see them in the door.

882
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:18,860
Haha!

883
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,460
All your friends are dying too.

884
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,160
Oh, come in.

885
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,420
Alright, get ready, my children.

886
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,900
Get ready, my children!

887
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,120
Did they...

888
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,340
He didn't even make a sound.

889
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:46,960
He just died.

890
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,840
Low HP, yeah, but there's no HP anywhere.

891
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,940
Oh, maybe here?

892
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:55,920
Ah, hi!

893
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,880
I lied.

894
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,700
There was HP right in front of me.

895
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,040
This whole time.

896
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,100
Wait, there we go, three.

897
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,300
I gotta remember three.

898
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,020
Anyway, that was easy.

899
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,340
Oh, wait.

900
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,980
The game is so kind.

901
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,180
Sometimes.

902
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,140
Sometimes the game is kind.

903
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,440
I thought that might be a little guy.

904
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,640
Okay, so...

905
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,360
Oh, wait.

906
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,220
It opened that door over there, right?

907
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,200
Okay, so...

908
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:33,640
Wait a second.

909
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,980
Watch out, babies.

910
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,580
Room with loot.

911
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,860
I saw it.

912
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,240
Nothing else.

913
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:48,760
Okay, nice.

914
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,640
Good job, team.

915
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,040
She found it.

916
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,000
Yeah, I have gamers.

Oh, there's more.

919
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:37,690
Wait, there's way more.

920
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:38,770
Oh, my goodness.

921
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,550
There's a ton of them.

922
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:40,250
Oh.

923
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,420
There we go.

924
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:12,880
Oh.

925
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:14,800
Oh, gosh.

926
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:15,400
It's a gamble.

927
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:16,440
Wait.

928
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,680
Oh, we broke it.

929
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,180
It's fine.

930
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,460
This thing's kind of heavy.

931
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:25,820
Okay.

932
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:26,940
All right.

933
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:27,860
Good job, team.

934
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:46,290
Come here and get your other friend.

935
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:47,030
Just kidding.

936
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,570
Come here.

937
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:48,750
Get your other friend.

938
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:52,210
Okay, team.

939
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:52,910
Oh, gosh.

940
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,050
There's a guy right there.

941
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,960
I didn't even know there was a third person.

942
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:04,960
Freaky.

943
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,780
Wait, how do I turn this off?

944
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,200
No.

945
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,180
I'm saving even though...

946
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,520
Oh, my babies would have taken care of them.

947
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,640
Wait, those aren't my babies.

948
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:24,000
babies?

949
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,300
Or...

950
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,660
Wait, that's a lot of them.

951
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:31,020
They're not coming to me.

952
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,080
Wait a second.

953
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,340
Uh-oh.

954
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,700
Take that.

955
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,100
Children!

956
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,860
My children.

957
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:46,650
Baby battle?

958
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:55,530
Uh...

959
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:03,130
I don't know why I've started using the SMG over my shotgun.

960
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,750
I don't know.

961
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,230
I just... I'm feeling it.

962
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:10,930
Um,

963
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:14,270
ah!

964
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:19,210
Go!

965
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,090
I don't know if they'll be able to.

966
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,830
Hold on, I'm gonna throw a grenade myself.

967
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,290
I don't think that made it far at all.

968
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:34,630
Wait, I heard something.

969
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:36,250
Is that one of mine?

970
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,190
Eli Vance, that's her dad, right?

971
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,430
No, don't touch it!

972
01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:44,450
Don't touch it!

973
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:56,170
I just keep hearing guys, hold on.

974
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,490
I'm trying to, like, pay attention to the audio at the same time, though.

975
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,640
Wait, is that a guy, or...

976
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,300
There was a guy.

977
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,400
Or a turret.

978
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:13,300
Actually, I can't tell.

979
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,540
Guy on a turret.

980
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,560
Talking about me.

981
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,260
Terror?

982
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,100
Chaos?

983
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:34,660
Chaos?

984
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,760
Maybe?

985
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:37,380
No.

986
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,020
Couldn't have been, man.

987
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,260
Oops.

988
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,160
Too hard.

989
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,720
There we go.

990
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:01,610
Can someone give me TLDR?

991
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,270
Nothing in here?

992
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,830
Oh, I was like, what the heck?

993
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:15,750
It's my baby's leg clipping through the wall.

994
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,610
You're on the radio.

995
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:19,690
They're talking about you.

996
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:24,250
Bad guy says bad things.

997
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:26,650
They captured Alex's dad.

998
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:45,940
Yeah, that's why we're that's why we're here why did i do that um guys so sorry did i save i did not so sorry i wanted to hear soup and i thought i had the gravity gun on

999
01:04:50,370 --> 01:05:01,330

1000
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,440
Where is...

1001
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,260
It's okay, we'll get through this easy.

1002
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,340
Go, baby, go!

1003
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:39,480
Yeah!

1004
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:40,800
Nice.

1005
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,560
And then another guy's gonna go up there, no?

1006
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:51,170
Maybe not.

1007
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:54,150
Maybe not.

1008
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:55,850
Oh, there he is.

1009
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:05,620
Ouch!

1010
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:06,080
Ouch!

1011
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:06,380
Ouch!

1012
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,160
I can't move when you're all here!

1013
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,660
Go, my babies!

1014
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:10,260
Go!

1015
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,820
Go get his butt!

1016
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:15,460
Go!

1017
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,000
Oh!

1018
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,560
Oh, wait.

1019
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:36,660
I feel like I should just Cross blowing.

1020
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:39,600
There we go.

1021
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,300
That's way easier.

1022
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,300
Okay, anyway.

1023
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:58,160
There's- this guy is yapping.

1024
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,580
He's saying so much.

1025
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:00,680
Excuse me.

1026
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,040
Soup.

1027
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,610
Oh, you scared me.

1028
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,940
Dang, did I only get one?

1029
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:23,300
Aw, that sucks.

1030
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:28,480
Dang.

1031
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,870
It would have been a nice shot had I made it.

1032
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:35,320
Oh, oh.

1033
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,300
No, my babies, no!

1034
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:46,710
Ouch, I'm low on HP.

1035
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:47,590
Ouch, ouch.

1036
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:55,080
Can I get more HP, please?

1037
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:57,940
No, no, no, no.

1038
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:58,440
Oh, shoot.

1039
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,640
This thing is fine for you.

1040
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,700
Where are you?

1041
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,060
Where are you?

1042
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,700
Where the heck?

1043
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,480
You guys get it already?

1044
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,360
You're so fast.

1045
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:14,860
Excuse me.

1046
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:15,900
Excuse me.

1047
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,540
You guys, my babies are better suited for outside.

1048
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:20,920
Okay.

1049
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,060
Okay, we're fine.

1050
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,460
Whoa, we're not fine!

1051
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:42,030
But actually, this is okay because I wanted to kind of redo this...

1052
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:43,310
Oh, that's...

1053
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,430
Okay, that's...

1054
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:47,190
I wanted to kind of redo this part, so...

1055
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,150
In the end...

1056
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:51,010
That didn't work out so well.

1057
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:55,050
Okay, actually, it was way better the first time.

1058
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:58,370
Oh.

1059
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:00,330
Guys!

1060
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:01,710
Guys!

1061
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:12,600
Okay.

1062
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,860
I'm still a little...

1063
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,440
A little more HP than before, I suppose.

1064
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,080
Holy cow.

1065
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,170
Alright, now we know these guys come in.

1066
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:29,440
Hmm, shoot.

1067
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:30,220
Yeah.

1068
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:31,280
Come on, come here!

1069
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,640
There we go.

1070
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:35,540
Oh, no?

1071
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:36,840
Still going?

1072
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,960
Oops, sorry.

1073
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:50,840
He's fine.

1074
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,480
Should

1075
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,880
I save?

1076
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,260
I'm not sure.

1077
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:09,280
I'm not sure.

1078
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,230
I'll save.

1079
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:15,310
We'll get more health.

1080
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,910
Hopefully, eventually.

1081
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:18,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1082
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:21,990
Oh, my babies go.

1083
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,110
I'm dying here.

1084
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:29,750
Oh my god, I see another guy on the stinking thing.

1085
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:31,550
Oh, shoot!

1086
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,610
Yeah, I do need a medical attention.

1087
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:39,570
Um...

1088
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:43,170
Yeah, crossbow would probably be good here.

1089
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,010
Okay.

1090
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:48,830
I got him.

1091
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:55,330
If I wouldn't be doing my duty as your administrator.

1092
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:57,270
Please, help!

1093
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:05,230
I hear more guys.

1094
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:14,030
I almost want to save, but at the same time, I'm like, I don't think I should.

1095
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:21,740
Nails.

1096
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,280
What?

1097
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:28,520
Health.

1098
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:29,360
Tiny bit.

1099
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:29,980
Okay, I'll save.

1100
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:38,910
Go, my babies!

1101
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:43,310
And everybody died.

1102
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,690
Oh, there's more of them.

1103
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:47,530
Okay, come on in.

1104
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,480
Oh, yes.

1105
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:53,280
Good job, team.

1106
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,040
I helped.

1107
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:00,680
Okay.

1108
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,460
Maybe not the most great place to...

1109
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,060
Okay, hold on.

1110
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,700
Let's do...

1111
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:09,660
Wee!

1112
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,020
Watch out!

1113
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:15,580
I'll also do that.

1114
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:17,320
Oh.

1115
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,080
There's nobody left!

1116
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:29,700
I'm so head empty here.

1117
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,180
Okay,

1118
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,280
let's see what we...

1119
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,300
No, no, my baby!

1120
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:54,760
Stop!

1121
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,080
Stop!

1122
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:56,480
Stop!

1123
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:57,100
Come here!

1124
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:57,740
Come here!

1125
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:01,280
Actually, actually, oh, this door is open.

1126
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,260
Okay, I didn't even notice it open or not.

1127
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,100
Is there anything I can throw?

1128
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:07,860
One moment!

1129
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:09,660
Come here.

1130
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,300
Babies.

1131
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:13,800
My little children.

1132
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:14,740
I love you so.

1133
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,020
My little...

1134
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,880
My little precious creatures.

1135
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,060
Oh, I missed.

1136
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,340
That's one way to do it.

1137
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,940
Did I get hit from that?

1138
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,500
I don't know if I took splash damage there, but whatever.

1139
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:40,860
I did?

1140
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,140
Minus three.

1141
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:44,520
Ouch, yeah.

1142
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:50,800
Oh, did I throw that?

1143
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:03,070
Oh, watch out.

1144
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:04,670
Aw.

1145
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:12,030
Ouch, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Please.

1146
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:15,350
I'm like literally living on a dream.

1147
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,290
Living on a prayer here.

1148
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:20,430
Okay, thank you for the 10.

1149
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:22,910
But I'll take it.

1150
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:24,850
Some is better than none.

1151
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:27,810
Where?

1152
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:30,530
Oh, I'm just going up, up and up and up and up.

1153
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:37,770
I have been asked to say a few words to the transhuman arm of sector 70 and Overwatch.

1154
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,010
I saw them.

1155
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,410
Concerning recent successes.

1156
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,310
Containing members of the resistance, science team.

1157
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:48,210
Does that even reach?

1158
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:49,830
Can they get me?

1159
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:51,350
Can I get them?

1160
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:53,370
They're coming over?

1161
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:55,930
Are they gonna run into that?

1162
01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:06,390
If I didn't pass along the message I have received from our benefactors, the capture of you advances in event of major significance, make no mistake.

1163
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:06,950
Ugh!

1164
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:07,950
Health!

1165
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:09,190
And stuff!

1166
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:11,050
Let's see.

1167
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:15,190
Anything that I can throw.

1168
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:21,470
Oops.

1169
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,220
I didn't mean to shoot this again.

1170
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,380
I clicked on the shotgun.

1171
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,000
It worked.

1172
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,080
I feel like I just wasted those, but whatever.

1173
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,480
Stop.

1174
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:49,880
Wait.

1175
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,020
Babies, one moment.

1176
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,160
Babies, babies, babies!

1177
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:02,140
I can't see you when you're in my way!

1178
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,260
Please, come here!

1179
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,240
Stay, stay!

1180
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,060
Love the bouncy ball of death?

1181
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:16,180
Did I get it?

1182
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,360
No.

1183
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:22,380
No.

1184
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,180
I'm just gonna take it.

1185
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:29,520
It's okay.

1186
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:30,940
I just saved right here.

1187
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,100
Let's see.

1188
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,220
I'll just throw a grenade and instead then.

1189
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:40,880
Yes?

1190
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:46,220
Good job, babies!

1191
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:51,560
Obviously, I am not on the ground to closely command or second guess the dedicated forces of the Overwatch.

1192
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,480
But this does not mean I can sure...

1193
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:54,780
Uh-oh.

1194
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:55,820
Here they come.

1195
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,100
come.

1196
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,520
Uh-oh, here they come.

1197
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:00,980
Oh,

1198
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,070
there they go.

1199
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,430
Just kidding.

1200
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:11,590
Okay, what's going on here?

1201
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:14,290
What is that?

1202
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:15,590
How is it possible?

1203
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:20,990
This is not some agent provocateur or...

1204
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:21,690
Provocateur.

1205
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:27,010
A stalker.

1206
01:17:27,850 --> 01:18:21,590
Oh, they're making more of these guys I have good reason to believe that in the intervening years he was in a state that precluded further development of covert skills the man you have consistently failed to slow let alone capture freaky standards simply that an ordinary man how can I fail to apprehend him okay well all right I believe the upgrade else no and they just stuck this guy in a closet so sad prove themselves an indispensable augmentation to the combine overwatch they will have to earn yeah they come

1207
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:34,780
is total extinction in union with all the other unworthy branches of the species Let's not allow it to come to that.

1208
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:41,050
To convince our benefactors that you are the finest in species.

1209
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:42,610
It's just so easy.

1210
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:44,930
Hold on, I'm going to see if they have anything.

1211
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,050
Yes, indeedy.

1212
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,090
Oh, yeah, baby.

1213
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:48,790
Okay, nice.

1214
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:49,730
My children.

1215
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:51,090
My children, please.

1216
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:51,850
My children.

1217
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:56,570
Okay.

1218
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:00,410
Look at that guy laying down over there.

1219
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:03,870
Lying on the job.

1220
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:12,280
Well, they give me quite a bit of supplies here now, don't they?

1221
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,120
Curious.

1222
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,660
Lazy bones.

1223
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,260
Dr. Bree, that was the first meet over.

1224
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:23,380
Okay.

1225
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,100
Are we gonna be fighting the mother again?

1226
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:27,000
No?

1227
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,140
Oh.

1228
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,800
Okay, finally he shut up.

1229
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:35,720
Oh, finally.

1230
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:39,960
More health?

1231
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:53,220
Is that to me?

1232
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,080
Is that right now?

1233
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,640
Is that...

1234
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:03,040
I don't

1235
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,600
know where I am.

1236
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,390
Here they come!

1237
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:17,870
No!

1238
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:22,450
I'm gonna go get them first!

1239
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:27,330
It's really quiet all of a sudden, though.

1240
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:29,290
Oh, wait.

1241
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:29,950
This is the one.

1242
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:31,290
They did take out the other queen.

1243
01:20:32,570 --> 01:20:32,790
Nice.

1244
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:34,670
Oh!

1245
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:39,270
Oh, come on.

1246
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:42,190
When I press throw, it doesn't always register.

1247
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:44,270
Oh!

1248
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:46,370
Stop!

1249
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:54,070
Nice.

1250
01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:54,810
Good job, team.

1251
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:04,590
I'm not even Well, I'll grab the rest of the health I'm not gonna say though Because that was kind of messy

1252
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:20,100
Good job team We're a team We're the best to ever do it Okay, even I know when I'm lying I

1253
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:28,300

01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:55,920
Okay, they'll stop noticing and go I don't know if I got any of them I didn't okay wait I can run into this room I probably

1255
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:18,820

1260
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,000
Wow, one bullet left.

1261
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,080
Oh, that was...

1262
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,940
Where are my babies?

1263
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,000
Why aren't you doing more, huh?

1264
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,740
Oh, was that guy, like, on the ground?

1265
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:25,880
Oh, no, they're getting the babies.

1266
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:28,600
Speak and they shall be summoned.

1267
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,780
I know I saw a guy.

1268
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:36,660
Oops.

1269
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:37,720
Ha ha ha ha.

1270
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:38,460
Hi.

1271
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,280
Yeah, get his butt.

1272
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:43,540
Oh, there's another!

1273
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,040
Oh my gosh.

1274
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:47,000
Uh-oh.

1275
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:47,720
Why is there?

1276
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:49,860
Suddenly scary.

1277
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:51,380
Woo!

1278
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:52,740
Woo!

1279
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:55,680
Wait!

1280
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:56,740
I've tried to...

1281
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,300
There we go.

1282
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,900
Just trying to switch my gun.

1283
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,460
I'm panicking.

1284
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,660
Where'd the turret go?

1285
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,140
Disappear?

1286
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,320
Disappear?

1287
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,620
I got knocked down somehow?

1288
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,200
Oh, there it is.

1289
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:21,960
Okay.

1290
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,700
I am half-life.

1291
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,480
She said it!

1292
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,180
The game!

1293
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:30,780
There was one here.

1294
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,060
How did that get all the way?

1295
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,200
Did I do that somehow?

1296
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,560
Maybe this trick shot and hit it?

1297
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,220
I might be better than I thought, you guys.

1298
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:52,400
That might be better than I thought.

1299
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:57,500
I think it was all mean.

1300
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,440
I'm taking the credit.

1301
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:01,340
Okay, wait.

1302
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,340
Before we go this way.

1303
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:04,300
Watch is up here.

1304
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:08,300
Huh?

1305
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:14,250
I hear it.

1306
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:14,770
But where?

1307
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:19,030
This...

1308
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,350
Calm down, calm down.

1309
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:28,630
I think he got me.

1310
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:32,970
No, it wasn't behind me, for sure.

1311
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:35,370
Nothing else.

1312
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:36,330
There's blood.

1313
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:43,910
Okay, I think that's probably the way we have to go.

1314
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:46,930
But I want to see and hear real quick.

1315
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:57,430

01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:20,920
There it is.

1332
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:25,430

1333
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,590
He's dead now.

1334
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:28,590

1335
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:30,450

1337
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:34,430
I don't want to take any risk.

1338

01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:45,810
High voltage.

1343
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:52,960

1344
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,000

01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:40,270
Humans have a lot of blood, I think.

01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:41,850
Like, surprisingly.

1351
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:48,960

01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,520
What the hell is this room?

1369
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:14,640
Okay.

01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:15,080

01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,260
There's turrets everywhere.

1378
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:33,500
Literally everywhere.

1379
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,260
Can I not...

1380
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,620
Wait, I can shoot in here because they...

1381
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:40,380
Oh gosh, they can shoot in here.

1382
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:43,400
I was going to say the gas looks like if you shoot, it'll explode.

1383
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:51,910
Babies, I need you to not do that.

1384
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:53,950
Ah!

1385
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:59,750

1386
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:00,910

1390
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:11,780
What to do?

1391
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:12,200

01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:23,320
She's a grenade.

1394
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,720
Can I try to save them?

1395
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:32,190
I try to save them for guys.

1396
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:34,650
But, you know.

1397
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:46,270

1399
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:41,270

Oh, Oh, I'm going to die.

01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:01,860
Okay, doki.

1495
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:06,920
Do I go this way?

1496
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,920
Do I go where they came from?

1497
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:10,180
Oh, I'm trapped, actually.

1498
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:12,440
I'm trapped.

1499
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:13,160
There we go.

1500
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:13,560
Again.

1501
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:17,820
Let's check out what was over here.

1502
01:39:18,660 --> 01:39:19,560
I did save, right?

1503
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,540
Okay, I did save.

1504
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:21,680
Oh, okay.

1505
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:22,880
We definitely...

1506
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:23,680
Wait, I'm last.

1507
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:26,080
No.

1508
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:29,840
Alright.

1509
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:37,930
Reminds me of the day before that used fake gunfire to make people think there were players around.

1510
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:40,730
Oh, like in multiplayer stuff?

1511
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:41,590
Oh, good.

1512
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:43,650
Okay, there was more ammo and stuff here too.

1513
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:46,510
Okay, that's where we came from, so I think this is where we go.

1514
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:50,030
Can't tell if chat is broken or not.

1515
01:39:51,190 --> 01:39:52,050
Are you guys alive?

1516
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,890
Is the stream alive?

1517
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:56,490
Is the stream alive?

1518
01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:07,210
It's okay, I'm fine talking to myself.

1519
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:08,410
I do it all the time.

1520
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:14,010
My babies are gone, but...

1521
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:17,230
My babies.

1522
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:21,670
Awful.

1523
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:37,060
Oh!

1524
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:39,780
Is that guy alive?

1525
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:42,780
I mean, he's dead, but he's dead alive.

1526
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:45,260
Yeah.

1527
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,000
Oh, boy.

1528
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:55,120
We can still hear this, Minto.

1529
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:56,160
We're still watching.

1530
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:57,100
Chai is dead, dead.

1531
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,220
Oh, thank you.

1532
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:00,380
Okay.

1533
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,560
I thought so.

1534
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,580
I was like, wait a second.

1535
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:04,960
I can hear you.

1536
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:07,840
Okay.

1537
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:14,440
Well, now it's just- now I feel alone and I'm a little bit even more nervous, but that's okay.

1538
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:17,000
This is fine.

1539
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,020
We persevere.

1540
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,140
Why is everything- why is it like this?

1541
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:26,560
Why is it all like crumbly?

1542
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,170
Um, that doesn't seem good.

1543
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,400
Things are real crumbly.

1544
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:47,020
Wait, uh, uh, I think I need to stack here.

1545
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:51,760
Oh my gosh, wait, I just ruined my chances of survival.

1546
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,060
I think I need to go in here.

1547
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:58,000
Ah!

1548
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:10,050
Okay, uh, I can't tell if this is timed or not.

1549
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:11,310
I'm just gonna keep running.

1550
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:16,450
What a...

1551
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:17,410
Entanglement.

1552
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:19,630
Wait, did I just beat a chapter?

1553
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:21,330
That one was pretty short.

1554
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:27,990
compared to like last last one

1555
01:42:35,050 --> 01:43:25,190
I'm scared not having you guys backseat me don't feel lonely now Chad is dead just like you no it's funny sometimes certain games like that I mean I know this game is so old so there's gonna be like lots of people that have played it a lot and have very opinionated ideas of how people should play should play wait Alex but I got a comment on my last playthrough that was like man people are really going crazy with the backseeing in this game it's me boy am I glad to see you me too I mean where am I hurrying can you lift me up what is this Doug!

1556
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,110
My dad's up there somewhere.

1557
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:31,430
I'm not holding area.

1558
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:34,190
It's gonna take some doing to get him out.

1559
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:36,870
Let's get out of here.

1560
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:38,250
You're not alone.

1561
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:38,950
We love you, Minto.

1562
01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:39,710
Thank you!

1563
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:41,710
I wonder why Chad is done.

1564
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:44,650
YouTube lost its entanglement with Chad.

1565
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:49,970
I used to have a... I'm a father now.

1566
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:51,370
Um, Alex.

1567
01:43:51,770 --> 01:43:52,370
I'm different.

1568
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:53,870
Hi, Minto.

1569
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:54,410
Hi!

1570
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:56,130
Wait, what else is in here?

1571
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:56,950
Anything?

1572
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:58,030
You're going too fast.

1573
01:43:58,170 --> 01:43:58,970
I like to explore.

1574
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:02,670
Okay, we're fine.

1575
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:05,750
Every time I see these packages, I want to...

1576
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:07,790
I want to... I think there's something in them.

1577
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:08,610
It's a package.

1578
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:09,870
Like, it just feels like there should be.

1579
01:44:09,870 --> 01:44:11,470
I'm afraid I'm flying blind here.

1580
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:17,510
Every now and then a Vortigon gets captured and sends back information, but we don't have a complete picture of the place.

1581
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:19,930
The little we do know is all bad.

1582
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:20,590
All bad.

1583
01:44:21,850 --> 01:44:22,590
Get ready.

1584
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:23,150
Oh.

1585
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:24,270
Okay.

1586
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,740
Alex, no!

1587
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,000
Oh, that was good timing.

1588
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:41,760
Holy cow.

1589
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:42,880
Are you good?

1590
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:45,920
Okay, I'm just shoving her.

1591
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:50,560
I'm gonna save real quick.

1592
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,540
She's in no rush.

1593
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,520
Why is there graffiti in the...

1594
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,440
Almost a graveyard in the jail?

1595
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:00,980
Ooh, that doesn't look good.

1596
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:04,840
Sorry, Gordon.

1597
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:06,220
Oh, you're fine.

1598
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:08,840
Not sure what to do.

1599
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:09,840
All the head pads.

1600
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:10,520
No, it's okay.

1601
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:11,440
You don't have to donate.

1602
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:13,600
That's definitely what you don't have to do.

1603
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:15,260
But thank you.

1604
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:16,900
Appreciate it very much.

1605
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:18,060
All right.

1606
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:19,280
Over here.

1607
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:19,980
Over here.

1608
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:22,320
Is he in one of those pods?

1609
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,200
See a cocoon?

1610
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:26,100
Okay, you're hacking.

1611
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:26,660
Let's go.

1612
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:30,960
Love me a sexy...

1613
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:54,540

1614
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,160
Ha!

1615
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:01,860
Done!

1616
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:03,080
Okay.

1617
01:46:11,210 --> 01:46:11,210
Damn.

1618
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:12,650
What if I...

1619
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:13,310
Okay.

1620
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:15,510
I won't get to where I am.

1621
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:17,110
Holy cow!

1622
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:17,830
Oh my god!

1623
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:19,290
I didn't see that guy!

1624
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:26,360
Where are we going?

1625
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:33,540
Can I get some... I need some health!

1626
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:34,080
Hold on!

1627
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:39,900
Like, that's a... that's... that's one of those things from the other gun, no?

1628
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,260
There he is!

1629
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:42,020
Papa!

1630
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,500
Which cocoon is- oh, that's- this is his cocoon?

1631
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:49,220
Let me see if I can get this open.

1632
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:50,140
Okay.

1633
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,660
I don't want him to be a stalker.

1634
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,560
Does I never play this game?

1635
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,540
Can you say you're backseating me?

1636
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,760
Jade Man is silencing us.

1637
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,840
Is that really you?

1638
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:08,200
I can't believe you found me.

1639
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:08,740
Uh-huh!

1640
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,040

1642
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:46,100
That's final.

1643
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,860
Ohana meets family.

1644
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:50,940
Don't worry, Dad.

1645
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:51,740
We'll find her.

1646
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:55,540
For now, I'm going to send you to the teleport chamber.

1647
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:56,740
Hey, thank you.

1648
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:58,420

1652
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,020
Bye-bye, Papa.

Look at him go!

1654
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:19,680
Let's get out of here.

1655
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:21,400
Okay.

1656
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:23,760
Be careful.

1657
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:25,900
There's gonna be guys.

1658
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,140
Okay.

1659
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:29,860
Right here.

1660
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:30,700
Right here.

1661
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:34,040
I'm gonna head back to the security station and try to patch into your suit radio.

1662
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:34,720
Wait.

1663
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,120
Wait till you hear from me.

1664
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:38,020
Hey, take care of yourself.

1665
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:39,580
Oh, I'm going by myself?

I think it's broke, broke.

1670
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:23,820
Oh, well.

1671
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:25,240
Sorry, guys.

1672
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:25,720
Okay.

1673
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,700
All right, Gordon, go on through.

1674
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,920
Hold on, I'm going to go see for items.

1675
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:35,180
Alex, you went so fast I didn't get to explore.

1676
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:37,940
Okay, I'm not going to backtrack that much.

1677
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:38,580
Okay, just kidding.

1678
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:39,760
All right, let's go.

1679
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:42,380
Go on, Gordon.

1680
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:43,840
I'm going.

1681
01:49:49,110 --> 01:49:49,370
Woo!

1682
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:54,960
Where's the other one?

1683
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:56,180
Where's your friend?

1684
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,020
They're so gross.

1685
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:03,240
They kind of remind me of Daddy Long legs sometimes, though.

1686
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:04,260
Oh.

1687
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:08,570
Okay.

1688
01:50:08,870 --> 01:50:09,570
We got him.

1689
01:50:11,130 --> 01:50:11,730
Got

1690
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:15,440
him.

1691
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:20,520
Oh, sorry.

1692
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,140
I turned up the volume a bit while they were talking.

1693
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,620
Very good, very good.

1694
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:30,280
Oh.

1695
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:31,100
Hey, it worked.

1696
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:34,100
Let's see what I can do to clear the way for you.

1697
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:35,780
We didn't see this game.

1698
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:38,560
Moss, man.

1699
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,120
Wait, Moss, man.

1700
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:45,800
Who died?

1701
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:50,370
Whoa, I'm flying.

1702
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:53,990
Who the heck is Moss, man?

1703
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:55,630
I'm scared.

1704
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:58,250
I'm scared.

1705
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:00,590
Even my test didn't show up.

1706
01:51:04,690 --> 01:51:06,230
Are you just watching me?

1707
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:06,850
Oh.

1708
01:51:08,690 --> 01:51:09,290
Yes, please.

1709
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:11,530
Okay, got it.

1710
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:12,850
Thank you.

1711
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:19,820
We're in the cleaner...

1712
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:20,140
Oh, wait.

1713
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:22,260
This is the, like, used part of the prison.

1714
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:24,900
They got a sandwich and everything.

1715
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:26,440
Moss, man.

1716
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:26,800
Careful.

1717
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:29,760
He'll make you phoneless.

1718
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:31,100
Ah!

1719
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:37,540
Thanks, I hate it.

1720
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:40,780
I got her soda!

1721
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:41,580
Okay.

1722
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:44,280
Wait, no, no, no.

1723
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,540
I want back to this.

1724
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:53,090
Anything in there?

1725
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:53,470
No.

1726
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,490
In here?

1727
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:57,030
No.

1728
01:51:57,710 --> 01:51:59,070
So many fake little...

1729
01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:00,950
I'm sorry, you guys really don't have to donate.

1730
01:52:01,110 --> 01:52:01,410
It's okay.

1731
01:52:01,530 --> 01:52:02,630
I'll just keep talking to myself.

1732
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:08,570
The yapping woman from earlier in the game who Alex doesn't like because she and her dad are flippant.

1733
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:10,230
Oh, thank you!

1734
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:12,730
Thank you, thank you.

1735
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:13,270
I did forget.

1736
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:16,570
Hello?

1737
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:21,670
A guy?

1738
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:24,510
Now what?

1739
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:32,190
I didn't even see it.

1740
01:52:32,910 --> 01:52:34,270
Usually I feel like...

1741
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:38,330
Usually I feel like I'm pretty observant about that kind of stuff.

1742
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:46,670
Well, you guys would say otherwise but you guys can't talk right now so um that's all you can say

1743
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:56,410
but i like the one needed to be though oh i feel bad so bad right now

1744
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:16,260

1745
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:20,020
Ah!

1746
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:21,300
And stuff.

1747
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:28,500
Yeah, die right.

1748
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,600
It's so...

1749
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:31,400
Hot dog!

1750
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,100
Otherwise.

1751
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,600
Don't have to, though.

1752
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:36,560
What?

1753
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:38,080
Sorry, you're breaking up.

1754
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:41,760
Why do I hear flies?

1755
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,340
Hot dog!

1756
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:47,100
I'm for one enjoying this new pay-to-chat experience.

1757
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:47,720
No!

1758
01:53:49,460 --> 01:54:07,070
a lot of combine sensors in the area ahead what's combine oh oh oh head crab

1759
01:54:10,210 --> 01:54:22,590
thank you organizer youtube hates us specifically tonight is it just us are there other chats that are happening that are more exciting waiting?

1760
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:27,250
Wait a second!

1761
01:54:27,930 --> 01:54:28,410
I see...

1762
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:34,970
Ouch, I think I just took that damage, didn't I?

1763
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:36,070
Ouch, ouch.

1764
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:39,190
I don't think I backed up that.

1765
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:49,400
This is a bad spot for me.

1766
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,680
Lacerations detected.

1767
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,660
Okay, I think that took care of some.

1768
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,220
Yeah, we can go now.

1769
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:07,900
I don't think there's any left.

1770
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:09,840
I almost was not left.

1771
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:15,700
I almost died too!

1772
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:18,380
Wait, oh, those are turrets, aren't they?

1773
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:19,300
Okay.

1774
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:21,540
Keep remember.

1775
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:23,320
Remember team, remember team.

1776
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:26,620
But I also want the supply box, but there's one over here too.

1777
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:31,480
Thank you.

1778
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:32,920
Okay.

1779
01:55:36,590 --> 01:55:37,550
Thank you.

1780
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:38,410
Hot dog.

1781
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:39,970
Oh my gosh, you guys, thank you.

1782
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:41,010
So sorry.

1783
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:42,050
Soup.

1784
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:44,610
Soup.

1785
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:45,730
Okay.

1786
01:55:50,260 --> 01:55:52,280
This does not look good.

1787
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:53,380
I have a room.

1788
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:55,780
Uh-oh.

1789
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:56,680
Look at the monitor.

1790
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:58,420
What?

1791
01:56:05,380 --> 01:56:06,280
Where are they?

1792
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:20,240
Oh my gosh.

1793
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:21,120
I didn't even see that.

1794
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:22,740
Medical attention.

1795
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,200
Holy cow, there's so many of them.

1796
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:27,400
Wait, wait, wait.

1797
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:28,620
Wait, what is this?

1798
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,340
Oh, they are just giving me bots.

1799
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,960
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1800
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:32,760
This is unfair.

1801
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:33,260
Wait.

1802
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:35,660
I died.

1803
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:37,240
Okay, hold on.

1804
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:39,680
Okay, we're fine.

1805
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:40,120
We're fine.

1806
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:43,640
I know they give me grenades, so I know what to do.

1807
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:44,980
Not bad.

1808
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:45,540
Five.

1809
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:46,740
G for grenade.

1810
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,200
Any plans to play Alex?

1811
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:51,700
Um, we'll see.

1812
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:53,720
Head crab.

1813
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:55,240
to the forehead.

1814
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:56,260
Uh-oh.

1815
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:57,160
Look at the monitor.

1816
01:56:57,440 --> 01:56:57,720
Okay.

1817
01:56:58,420 --> 01:56:58,900
I see.

1818
01:56:59,220 --> 01:56:59,420
Alright.

1819
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:11,310
Hey!

1820
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:12,650
No!

1821
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:17,590
Oh my gosh!

1822
01:57:17,710 --> 01:57:18,890
I don't like this part at all.

1823
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:22,650
There feels like too many men!

1824
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:24,130
There's too many men!

1825
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:30,780
Gosh.

1826
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:46,100
I think I... Nope.

1827
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:02,830
I won't be silenced.

1828
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:03,510
Minto is cute.

1829
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:04,350
Yeah, I said it.

1830
01:58:06,890 --> 01:58:07,810
This part.

1831
01:58:08,470 --> 01:58:08,870
Yucky.

1832
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:10,430
Okay, hold on.

1833
01:58:13,330 --> 01:58:19,830
They give me so many grenades, but I'm not good at aiming it.

1834
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:23,380
Look at the monitor.

1835
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:23,960
I know.

1836
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,260
It scares me, too.

1837
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,040
Wait, I want to also.

1838
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:49,450
I don't think that hit at all.

1839
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:51,530
Oh, maybe it did.

1840
01:58:52,650 --> 01:58:53,230
Maybe it did.

1841
01:58:54,570 --> 01:58:55,370
I'm saving.

1842
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:56,590
Oh, I was thinking halfway.

1843
01:58:59,330 --> 01:59:00,070
Maybe halfway?

1844
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:00,570
I don't know.

1845
01:59:00,810 --> 01:59:01,710
I don't, I just said that.

1846
01:59:01,790 --> 01:59:02,390
You know what I mean.

1847
01:59:07,950 --> 01:59:09,750
Okay, maybe I actually got him this time.

1848
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:13,350
Maybe I actually did it.

1849
01:59:14,290 --> 01:59:14,850
I can't tell.

1850
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:15,430
It's so dark.

1851
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:16,630
Okay.

1852
01:59:17,310 --> 01:59:17,590
Yeah.

1853
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:18,230
Yeah.

1854
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:19,210
Baby.

1855
01:59:19,650 --> 01:59:19,890
Okay.

1856
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:23,450
Just like...

1857
01:59:24,590 --> 01:59:26,170
One scene in Joker 2.

1858
01:59:26,310 --> 01:59:27,750
Should we swap to waiting room chat?

1859
01:59:27,890 --> 01:59:28,630
It's working there?

1860
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:30,390
Why?

1861
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:31,910
Why does this hate me?

1862
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:36,710
Why does YouTube hate me?

1863
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:39,630
I don't think that would make a difference.

1864
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:41,470
I think it would be...

1865
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:44,230
I'd have to pull up a bunch of other stuff.

1866
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:47,050
But honestly, I don't feel like doing it.

1867
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:51,400
Thank you.

1868
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:55,720
Ah.

1869
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:00,280
Microtransaction is the hot new way to ramble by mail.

1870
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:02,260
I don't know, but it's dead.

1871
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:03,460
I don't know.

1872
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:06,480
I did a test, and even that didn't go through on my end.

1873
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:12,020
So I have no idea what the issue is.

1874
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:16,600
I wish I could tell you guys.

1875
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:20,800
The VOD watchers are probably like, oh my god, just shut up about it already.

1876
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:26,420
I think I got one at least.

1877
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:29,280
Yes, I got one.

1878
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:31,700
Nice.

1879
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:34,340
Is this thing on?

1880
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:39,180
Thinking Swizzers and these guys are trying to kill you, Vito.

1881
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:41,000
Oh, no.

1882
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:44,700
Wait, ow, ow, ow.

1883
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:51,240
Oh.

1884
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,840
This is too high stress for me.

1885
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:57,960
What was I thinking?

1886
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:01,200
Oh, I'll go from relaxing game peak to...

1887
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:02,280
high stress.

1888
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:03,580
A still?

1889
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:06,120
To a high stress half-life.

1890
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:08,620
What was I thinking?

1891
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:13,400
Live stream to a let's play.

1892
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:14,220
It's true.

1893
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,240
It does feel that way.

1894
02:01:25,070 --> 02:01:28,330
Okay, we finally took him down.

1895
02:01:29,410 --> 02:01:30,610
Finally took him down.

1896
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:33,030
Downs.

1897
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:34,590
Downs.

1898
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:36,130
Is this a room I can open?

1899
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:38,410
Oh my gosh, stop.

1900
02:01:38,890 --> 02:01:40,790
I'm not trying to pick up everything in the world.

1901
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:53,400
Okay.

1902
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:00,280
Tonno chat is so it.

1903
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:05,140
I hate this.

1904
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:06,620
Hi

1905
02:02:13,650 --> 02:02:14,410
for me!

1906
02:02:17,370 --> 02:02:18,010
Oh.

1907
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:23,190
Oh.

1908
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:30,080
Donkey Kong gameplay.

1909
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,020
Nice barrel throws.

1910
02:02:32,740 --> 02:02:33,560
Why, thank you.

1911
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:35,000
Did I get all of them?

1912
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:38,660
What's this?

1913
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:40,900
Okay, they want me to throw grenades in there, right?

1914
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:42,820
Alright, I can do that.

1915
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:45,820
Did that hit?

1916
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:49,600
Maybe I need to, like, bounce it here.

1917
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:52,040
Wait, did I just go into the room?

1918
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:54,100
Maybe I need to bounce it here.

1919
02:02:57,420 --> 02:03:00,020
There we go, there we go!

1920
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:01,440
So this works?

1921
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:02,560
It does not!

1922
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:08,180
I don't want it to just keep repeating and like, you know, what's the word?

1923
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:15,340
I don't want it to just keep saying all the, my, whatever, uh, you know, the things.

1924
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:16,460
The sounds.

1925
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:19,140
A little don't know sounds over and over again.

1926
02:03:27,490 --> 02:03:28,530
Oh my gosh.

1927
02:03:30,850 --> 02:03:32,030
I almost did not see that.

1928
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:32,730
Wait, this one's easy.

1929
02:03:32,910 --> 02:03:33,650
It's nice and close.

1930
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:45,690
Okay, this is a little area.

1931
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:48,130
I like the funny sounds.

1932
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:55,570
Wait, let's go back to this.

1933
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:56,910
No!

1934
02:03:57,070 --> 02:03:57,190
No!

1935
02:03:57,570 --> 02:03:57,610
No!

1936
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:57,850
No!

1937
02:03:57,930 --> 02:03:57,930
No!

1938
02:03:58,070 --> 02:03:58,230
No!

1939
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:05,630
So unfair.

1940
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:08,650
So unfair, you bastards!

1941
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:11,750
Oops.

1942
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:17,670
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna die here because I'm trying to do this.

1943
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:28,580
I think there was health over there, though.

1944
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:29,020
I remember.

1945
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:35,490
Well, I say health.

1946
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:36,250
I don't know what it is.

1947
02:04:36,570 --> 02:04:38,310
Oh my gosh, it's just one of these!

1948
02:04:38,770 --> 02:04:39,670
I wasted all of that.

1949
02:04:39,730 --> 02:04:40,930
I was so greedy for nothing.

1950
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:42,870
New chatter here.

1951
02:04:42,950 --> 02:04:43,910
Am I doing this right?

1952
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:45,090
I don't know, you guys.

1953
02:04:45,150 --> 02:04:45,990
I'm so sorry.

1954
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:48,010
I'm so sorry.

1955
02:04:48,790 --> 02:04:52,610
Shotgun Minky is kind of scary, you think?

1956
02:04:54,550 --> 02:04:55,050
Why?

1957
02:04:56,290 --> 02:04:56,810
Why?

1958
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:57,050
Oh.

1959
02:04:58,650 --> 02:05:00,010
What was that?

1960
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:08,430
Occupy them.

1961
02:05:09,570 --> 02:05:09,870
Why?

1962
02:05:17,140 --> 02:05:18,260
My

1963
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:27,760
health though.

1964
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:33,180
Oh no!

1965
02:05:40,490 --> 02:05:41,390
Oh, please say no.

1966
02:05:41,850 --> 02:05:42,750
Please don't say that.

1967
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:47,870
Combat turrets.

1968
02:05:48,250 --> 02:05:48,730
Combat turrets.

1969
02:05:49,470 --> 02:05:49,750
These?

1970
02:05:50,290 --> 02:05:50,950
Yeah, yeah.

1971
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:51,370
These?

1972
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:52,130
Okay.

1973
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,680
Okay.

1974
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,120
Oh my gosh, we're doing a defense.

1975
02:06:01,880 --> 02:06:03,620
We're doing a... Oh gosh, wait.

1976
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:15,420
Wait, but my health!

1977
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:21,880
Okay.

1978
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:23,820
Shotgun.

1979
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:24,840
Until time.

1980
02:06:29,610 --> 02:06:30,090
No!

1981
02:06:31,590 --> 02:06:32,490
That's where they come from!

1982
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:40,150
I didn't know which way...

1983
02:06:40,150 --> 02:06:41,770
Oh, I don't know why I thought from here.

1984
02:06:44,590 --> 02:06:45,390
I hear him.

1985
02:06:47,290 --> 02:06:48,550
Yeah, kill that guy!

1986
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:50,190
Oh my gosh.

1987
02:06:50,930 --> 02:06:51,450
It's scary.

1988
02:06:55,810 --> 02:06:56,490
I don't...

1989
02:06:56,490 --> 02:06:57,550
I don't like this!

1990
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:07,670

1994
02:08:19,790 --> 02:08:20,450
Mickey with a shotgun!

1995
02:08:22,330 --> 02:08:24,650
I wish I could have the turrets on my side.

1996
02:08:25,170 --> 02:08:26,790
Oh, all the time.

1997
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:37,660
Moving so fast you can't see us all.

1998
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:38,260
Call her cute.

1999
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:38,720
No!

2000
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:45,880
Chat's moving at so fast speed you can't see it moving at all.

2001
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:51,100
It's moving so fast.

2002
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:56,800
It's just in a constant state of single movement.

2003
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:58,680
Wait, can I shoot from here?

2004
02:09:02,660 --> 02:09:03,540
Whoa, gosh.

2005
02:09:08,490 --> 02:09:09,170
I can.

2006
02:09:11,810 --> 02:09:14,270
Achievement to killing someone with a man hack.

2007
02:09:14,650 --> 02:09:15,230
Oh, really?

2008
02:09:15,710 --> 02:09:16,410
Be there in a second.

2009
02:09:16,810 --> 02:09:18,330
Oh, please, please hurry.

2010
02:09:20,590 --> 02:09:22,810
Oh my gosh, you almost landed on my head!

2011
02:09:23,190 --> 02:09:23,870
Sorry, it took me so long.

2012
02:09:24,470 --> 02:09:25,510
Yeah, you could say you kept him.

2013
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:33,970
waiting let's see if we can find mossman it looks like this station ice monkey in the middle of the room there

2014
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:55,440
she is oh no wait wait a minute how'd she attach to a turret i don't know how it feels in your area i'm not calling about that what's she up to you promised you weren't going to touch you like oh my god these soldiers were a bit overzealous i admit but he was too tempting a

2015
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:03,820
You would have had Freeman if you'd been patient and dissuaded from my signal.

2016
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:04,000
Ah!

2017
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:08,440
We weren't entirely sure you were ever going to get around to that.

2018
02:10:09,020 --> 02:10:10,760
Human loyalties being what they are.

2019
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:17,100
Dr. Br- Dr. Br- As I have seen it before, you have to let Eli come around on his own.

2020
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:20,740
I have known Dr. Vance far longer than you, my dear.

2021
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:24,900
I'm afraid your feelings- I'm afraid your feelings.

2022
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:27,800
This is nothing to do with feelings.

2023
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:30,680
It's a simple truth that when Eli believes in our...

2024
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:33,260
This is not open to debate, Dr. Mossman.

2025
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:34,620
Doctor, please...

2026
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:35,480
So sorry, Judith.

2027
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:36,960
I'm all out of time.

2028
02:10:37,820 --> 02:10:38,240
Damn her!

2029
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:39,380
I don't believe this!

2030
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:42,940
Come on, Gordon.

2031
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:44,220
Now we've really gotta hurry.

2032
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:45,860
Go on ahead.

2033
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,560
I'll disrupt the next level of security and catch up with you when I can.

2034
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:49,200
Wait!

2035
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:50,440
Oh, man.

2036
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:50,820
Wait.

2037
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:52,680
Okay.

2038
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:56,600
I guess I can collect all their stuff now.

2039
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,560
Got anything?

2040
02:10:59,140 --> 02:10:59,620
I didn't drop.

2041
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:00,720
Oh, I guess I'm full.

2042
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:03,040
Go on, Gordon.

2043
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:03,900
I'm...

2044
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:04,560
Hold on!

2045
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:05,300
Oh, there we go.

2046
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:15,060
Seven!

2047
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:17,320
We're containment seven!

2048
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:19,580
Uh-oh!

2049
02:11:20,460 --> 02:11:22,360
Which way do I go?

2050
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,120
Which way do I go?

2051
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:26,000
Nope.

2052
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:30,820
Seven!

2053
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:32,520
That's me!

2054
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:36,320
Okay.

2055
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:37,060
Okay.

2056
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:39,920
This way!

2057
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:41,620
Oh, the little pods.

2058
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:43,120
Are there anybody in there?

2059
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:44,940
No, they're empty.

2060
02:11:59,450 --> 02:12:01,230
I think this is the way I'm supposed to go.

2061
02:12:04,110 --> 02:12:04,550
Yes.

2062
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:08,990
Maybe.

2063
02:12:10,650 --> 02:12:11,130
Maybe.

2064
02:12:13,170 --> 02:12:14,430
Oh wait, I don't know why.

2065
02:12:15,270 --> 02:12:16,510
We'll do this gun instead.

2066
02:12:20,910 --> 02:12:21,390
Spooky.

2067
02:12:22,810 --> 02:12:24,450
Any head crabs?

2068
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:33,440
I don't like it, guys.

2069
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:34,560
I don't like it.

2070
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:36,660
It's getting dark.

2071
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:37,720
Oh, hold on.

2072
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:38,960
Let's let it reset.

2073
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:41,620
Who are better?

2074
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:43,140
Babies, turrets, or bugs?

2075
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:45,860
The babies!

2076
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:48,720
I actually really like the turrets too, though.

2077
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:49,800
They did a good job.

2078
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:50,660
I'm not gonna lie.

2079
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:55,340
A dog!

2080
02:12:55,720 --> 02:12:56,680
A dog!

2081
02:12:57,860 --> 02:12:59,900
This doesn't feel like a very hot dog moment.

2082
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:04,940
Why do I feel like I'm back in ra- So sorry.

2083
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:06,460
So sorry it's so loud.

2084
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:07,480
Oh my gosh.

2085
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:13,140
Why do I feel like I'm back in that horrible place?

2086
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:14,320
I don't want to be there again.

2087
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:24,560
Imagine doing a horror game without chat.

2088
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,740
No, no, I don't want to imagine that.

2089
02:13:34,910 --> 02:13:35,790
What was it?

2090
02:13:37,190 --> 02:13:39,910
I don't like blowing them up because I don't know what I get.

2091
02:13:41,170 --> 02:13:42,710
I think I got health, I think.

2092
02:13:48,940 --> 02:13:50,280
I don't want to think about that.

2093
02:13:53,260 --> 02:13:55,360
I think I'm dependent on you guys.

2094
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:10,040
Pinkies are proud creatures.

2095
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:11,840
They prefer to give a look.

2096
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,640
Oh, dead guy.

2097
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,460
Oh, so definitely don't touch the water.

2098
02:14:32,620 --> 02:14:34,220
Wait, are we parkouring through water?

2099
02:14:34,780 --> 02:14:35,640
Oh, this is evil.

2100
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:37,680
No, no, no.

2101
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:39,300
Say it ain't so.

2102
02:14:40,940 --> 02:14:42,720
And then there's also...

2103
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:42,940
Wait.

2104
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:51,660
Say it ain't so!

2105
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:57,140
Kind of what you're doing now, so no need to imagine.

2106
02:14:59,680 --> 02:15:01,140
I did save, right?

2107
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:02,100
Oh my gosh, wait.

2108
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:05,180
I hope I saved.

2109
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:06,700
Okay, good.

2110
02:15:15,230 --> 02:15:17,650
She depends us.

2111
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:18,930
On us.

2112
02:15:21,350 --> 02:15:22,190
I don't get it.

2113
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:26,190
Imagine we are now the ghosts that are haunting you, and this is our spirit box.

2114
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:35,720
This is hard.

2115
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:37,580
Oh, no.

2116
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:38,920
Wait, jump into the water.

2117
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:39,620
I dare you.

2118
02:15:41,380 --> 02:15:42,420
He was...

2119
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:45,580
Grabs are so cute the way they like kind of trot, though.

2120
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:46,200
They're like...

2121
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:48,160
You know what?

2122
02:15:50,500 --> 02:15:52,000
That's what they sound like to me.

2123
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:54,620
In my head.

2124
02:15:56,100 --> 02:15:57,940
I think I depend on her too.

2125
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:00,020
Look how cute he is.

2126
02:16:00,140 --> 02:16:01,120
Just walk it a lot.

2127
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:02,440
Nah, never mind.

2128
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:08,580
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

2129
02:16:10,840 --> 02:16:11,640
This thing...

2130
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:21,480
this guy doesn't seem like a good plan though to be what is that oh thank someone pooped in the pool

2131
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:46,020
oh this is hard my health is already so low i think i'm just gonna need to use these two crates if i can you know you know I think I killed him.

2132
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:51,090
Now he's dead.

2133
02:16:55,110 --> 02:16:55,170
Oh.

2134
02:16:56,430 --> 02:16:56,790
Who

2135
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:02,840
donated us insom?

2136
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:04,000
Who are you?

2137
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:05,040
How old are you?

2138
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:06,220
Alright, you forgot.

2139
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:07,140
Are you French?

2140
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:12,880
Ghostly wiggles in the lower right corner are way cuter than the crab ones.

2141
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:13,380
No!

2142
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:14,760
Okay.

2143
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:19,600
Alright, we're taking this nice and easy.

2144
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:21,360
Slow and steady.

2145
02:17:23,060 --> 02:17:23,880
Oh.

2146
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:26,080
Oh.

2147
02:17:28,020 --> 02:17:28,580
Oh.

2148
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:34,960
I think he got caught by the, uh...

2149
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:37,060
By the electricity?

2150
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:38,840
Just a hunch?

2151
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:42,440
Oh!

2152
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:42,980
Ouch!

2153
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:43,380
Me too!

2154
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:43,920
Ah!

2155
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:48,160
Ah!

2156
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:49,420
Okay, wait.

2157
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:51,600
I think it's way easier to go from up here.

2158
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:54,360
Potentially.

2159
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:55,940
Oh.

2160
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:05,560
But I think I need to go with the crates so I can have them, I think.

2161
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:10,820
Wait, what did I kill?

2162
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:11,560
What did I shoot?

2163
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:13,380
Wait, why did I have minor lacerations?

2164
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:14,460
Why are we doing that?

2165
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:18,120
Okay, hold on.

2166
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:20,260
Let's just see what this way it takes me to.

2167
02:18:21,180 --> 02:18:21,500
You know?

2168
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:23,960
You're a soup.

2169
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:25,240
I'm a soup.

2170
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:30,760
Can't handle a kid's these days are so soft.

2171
02:18:31,220 --> 02:18:32,740
Can't handle a little electrocution.

2172
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:37,960
Back in my day, we walked to and from school ankle deep in toaster water.

2173
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:39,900
I believe it, Grandpa.

2174
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:44,060
Yeah, I feel like I need...

2175
02:18:44,060 --> 02:18:46,420
Wait, maybe I can grab them, though, over here.

2176
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:46,780
Oh.

2177
02:18:56,630 --> 02:18:57,030
Oh.

2178
02:18:58,250 --> 02:19:01,150
Guys, I didn't have the gravity gun.

2179
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:13,900
Guys!

2180
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:18,060
Okay, we have the gravity gun.

2181
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:19,660
Oh, there he is.

2182
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:22,720
Oh, where'd he go?

2183
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:27,800
Okay, nice.

2184
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:28,480
Oh, ouch!

2185
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:29,740
That's alright.

2186
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:30,340
It's alright.

2187
02:19:30,660 --> 02:19:31,440
He takes it.

2188
02:19:31,480 --> 02:19:31,980
He takes it.

2189
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:32,560
He takes it.

2190
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:35,760
Peak looks real different.

2191
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:38,900
Yeah, it's a brand new update, actually.

2192
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:39,900
It's really cool.

2193
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:48,320
Don't break on me.

2194
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:50,540
Okay, good enough.

2195
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:51,680
Good enough.

2196
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:54,900
Alright, and then...

2197
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:55,740
Okay.

2198
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:57,760
Very good.

2199
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:06,120
Okay.

2200
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:07,220
Alright.

2201
02:20:10,740 --> 02:20:11,700
Okay.

2202
02:20:12,220 --> 02:20:12,360
Alright.

2203
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:13,980
Okay.

2204
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:15,420
Alright.

2205
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:17,120
Oh.

2206
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:17,980
That was...

2207
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:25,280

02:21:22,330 --> 02:21:23,970
It's hurting me!

Um, F... F...

2213
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:28,110
9.

2214
02:21:28,410 --> 02:21:28,890
There we go.

2215
02:21:30,150 --> 02:21:32,030
I'm not gonna waste that!

2216
02:21:32,410 --> 02:21:32,610
Okay.

2217
02:21:33,930 --> 02:21:35,190
Okay, don't get close.

2218
02:21:35,710 --> 02:21:36,590
I learned my lesson.

2219
02:21:38,630 --> 02:21:39,930
Way to conquer electricity.

2220
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:41,550
Yes.

2221
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:43,150
Call me...

2222
02:21:43,810 --> 02:21:44,690
The science guy.

2223
02:21:46,490 --> 02:21:47,230
Uh...

2224
02:21:47,230 --> 02:21:49,130
Call me...

2225
02:21:53,150 --> 02:21:53,790
Uh...

2226
02:21:53,790 --> 02:21:54,770
Meantow.

2227
02:21:56,930 --> 02:21:59,310
How does a single barrel shotgun shoot double?

2228
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:01,010
Explain that.

2229
02:22:02,410 --> 02:22:04,330
Like, don't even worry about it.

2230
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:09,790
Like, don't even worry your pretty little head.

2231
02:22:18,250 --> 02:22:18,550
Oh.

2232
02:22:19,490 --> 02:22:20,130
Oh.

2233
02:22:22,870 --> 02:22:23,450
Oh.

2234
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:24,090
Oh.

2235
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:27,950
Come to me.

2236
02:22:29,970 --> 02:22:30,470
Nice.

2237
02:22:31,970 --> 02:22:32,130
Oh.

2238
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:34,290
Wait, I'm full of these, though.

2239
02:22:34,470 --> 02:22:35,010
Dang it.

2240
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:41,900
But what if I use it right now?

2241
02:22:42,860 --> 02:22:43,940
And then I'll have another one.

2242
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:46,320
On the ready.

2243
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:47,760
Okay, here we go.

2244
02:22:55,130 --> 02:22:55,470
Okay.

2245
02:22:55,790 --> 02:22:56,290
Never mind.

2246
02:23:10,450 --> 02:23:11,470
Choo, thank you.

2247
02:23:12,570 --> 02:23:16,430
I hear that ghosts are extra cute when they are free men.

2248
02:23:17,670 --> 02:23:19,430
Looks like this is true.

2249
02:23:20,210 --> 02:23:20,350
Really?

2250
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:22,810
Who told you?

2251
02:23:23,810 --> 02:23:24,930
Who told you that?

2252
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:47,680
Coming!

2253
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:57,000
You think they can see me here with my flashlight on?

2254
02:24:06,510 --> 02:24:07,130
You think he saw me?

2255
02:24:09,770 --> 02:24:10,850
TikTok, TikTok, TikTok.

2256
02:24:10,870 --> 02:24:15,570
I see them though.

2257
02:24:24,430 --> 02:24:24,850
That work?

2258
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:29,100
TikTok, TikTok.

2259
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:34,440
Can they shoot me through here?

2260
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:37,920
Oh, they're trying.

2261
02:24:43,490 --> 02:24:45,150
Let's try like my pistol.

2262
02:24:48,280 --> 02:24:49,750
I don't think I can get through there.

2263
02:24:59,710 --> 02:25:00,970
I can, I can.

2264
02:25:03,390 --> 02:25:04,350
Let's go.

2265
02:25:07,550 --> 02:25:08,130
I lied.

2266
02:25:09,010 --> 02:25:10,150
I could shoot them for there.

2267
02:25:12,770 --> 02:25:13,250
Yep.

2268
02:25:18,590 --> 02:25:19,350
TikTok, TikTok.

2269
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:24,750
Who?

2270
02:25:25,130 --> 02:25:26,350
Oh, I see you.

2271
02:25:27,650 --> 02:25:28,630
I see you.

2272
02:25:29,330 --> 02:25:29,830
Where'd you go?

2273
02:25:30,050 --> 02:25:30,770
I don't see you.

2274
02:25:30,970 --> 02:25:31,470
I see you.

2275
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:45,000
I think I got him.

2276
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:48,140
I hear movement anyway, though.

2277
02:25:48,900 --> 02:25:48,960
Alright.

2278
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:52,800
Did I save?

2279
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:53,260
There we go.

2280
02:25:53,820 --> 02:25:53,960
TikTok.

2281
02:25:55,820 --> 02:25:58,820
Another phrase for me to say over and over again, like, booty shot.

2282
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:01,780
Booty shot.

2283
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:02,900
That one's still the best, though.

2284
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:04,320
Booty shot.

2285
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:05,080
Booty shot.

2286
02:26:05,180 --> 02:26:07,380
I'll never leave my brain, I think.

2287
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:09,520
Permanently.

2288
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:11,800
Stuck saying night.

2289
02:26:16,730 --> 02:26:17,130
Okay.

2290
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:25,900
Spooky.

2291
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:33,020
I guess it doesn't matter which side I go to, huh?

2292
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:36,440
They both connect.

2293
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:38,620
Oh, wait.

2294
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:39,280
Oh, there we go.

2295
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:40,840
It's gonna say, can I?

2296
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:43,920
I'm picking up more incoming soldiers.

2297
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:45,760
See if there's some more turrets nearby.

2298
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:47,280
Oh, no, no!

2299
02:26:47,460 --> 02:26:48,140
Please, really!

2300
02:26:48,740 --> 02:26:49,080
Okay.

2301
02:26:49,980 --> 02:26:51,160
Quick, get these set up.

2302
02:26:51,740 --> 02:26:53,480
I'm seeing soldiers in all directions.

2303
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:54,700
What does that mean?

2304
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:01,020
Where else should I put?

2305
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:02,360
There's only three!

2306
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:09,610
I heard?

2307
02:27:11,870 --> 02:27:13,450
Get them set up, she said.

2308
02:27:13,870 --> 02:27:15,130
Well, well, like, what?

2309
02:27:16,130 --> 02:27:16,670
Here they come?

2310
02:27:18,090 --> 02:27:18,850
Oh, gosh.

2311
02:27:19,090 --> 02:27:19,710
This sounds bad.

2312
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:24,620
Holy.

2313
02:27:29,580 --> 02:27:30,120
Yeah, that's...

2314
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:30,960
I'll take him out.

2315
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:40,480
Wait, he's already out?

2316
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:42,060
No freaking way.

2317
02:27:52,840 --> 02:27:54,520
I think I saved at a bad time.

2318
02:28:04,690 --> 02:28:05,670
More soldiers, okay.

2319
02:28:06,350 --> 02:28:08,030
Yeah, I didn't think that they were gone.

2320
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:14,280
Oh gosh.

2321
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:22,080
Am I gonna die here?

2322
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:25,500
I'm gonna put you...

2323
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:25,820
There.

2324
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:30,080
This is bad.

2325
02:28:30,600 --> 02:28:32,260
Oh my gosh, you guys are back!

2326
02:28:41,230 --> 02:28:43,010
You live and I die.

2327
02:28:44,130 --> 02:28:44,830
Holy cow.

2328
02:28:45,030 --> 02:28:46,590
Wait, this is so difficult.

2329
02:28:50,970 --> 02:28:52,810
He already took them both out!

2330
02:28:54,490 --> 02:28:55,750
I can't lift them up!

2331
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:58,150
No, no, no, I hate this.

2332
02:28:58,250 --> 02:28:59,230
Wait, I hate this so much.

2333
02:28:59,390 --> 02:29:00,330
Wait, I hate this.

2334
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:01,970
I hate this!

2335
02:29:02,310 --> 02:29:03,510
How do I pick them up?

2336
02:29:03,570 --> 02:29:04,950
If I pick them up, they don't...

2337
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:05,610
Oh, there it is.

2338
02:29:05,710 --> 02:29:05,950
Okay.

2339
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,140
Where's my other guy?

2340
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:15,380
That's not him.

2341
02:29:15,940 --> 02:29:16,540
There he is.

2342
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:18,000
Please.

2343
02:29:20,440 --> 02:29:21,420
This is not good.

2344
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:22,820
This is so bad, actually.

2345
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:24,100
This is actually so bad.

2346
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:26,280
Oh my gosh.

2347
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:27,980
Please.

2348
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:29,020
Why?

2349
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:31,360
No, no, God, please.

2350
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:31,860
Ah!

2351
02:29:32,480 --> 02:29:33,440
I'm gonna die.

2352
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:35,300
Oh, wait, there's health here.

2353
02:29:35,580 --> 02:29:36,020
Let's win!

2354
02:29:37,380 --> 02:29:37,740
Ah!

2355
02:29:38,020 --> 02:29:38,240
Ah!

2356
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:41,760
Oh,

2357
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:52,400
we are so back.

2358
02:29:52,920 --> 02:29:53,700
Welcome back, everybody.

2359
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:55,020
That was so bizarre, huh?

2360
02:29:56,700 --> 02:29:58,200
This part is not fun.

2361
02:29:58,340 --> 02:29:59,540
Fun not, yeah.

2362
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:01,920
This is the hardest room of the game for me.

2363
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:03,860
Oh, ah.

2364
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:09,460
They need to be facing correctly.

2365
02:30:09,580 --> 02:30:12,880
That's the one thing I can't tell what way they're supposed to be.

2366
02:30:13,960 --> 02:30:14,640
Oh, okay.

2367
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:16,520
Good to know that there's a third round.

2368
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:18,320
Okay, wait, hold on.

2369
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:18,940
We can tell.

2370
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:22,540
Okay, Toyo, thank you so much for the thank you for the thank you.

2371
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:25,580
Hold on, I need to hydrate a little bit.

2372
02:30:28,620 --> 02:30:29,560
You guys survived.

2373
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:30,520
You're the strongest.

2374
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:33,520
You're the strongest here.

2375
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:38,380
I was watching the whole time, but I still missed it.

2376
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:41,760
Would you like some quality backseating, Minto?

2377
02:30:42,060 --> 02:30:43,660
Actually, yes.

2378
02:30:45,580 --> 02:30:48,180
Some quality backseating for this part.

I need to get rid of this guy.

I wish I could grab that.

2393
02:32:48,400 --> 02:32:48,780
Oh!

2394
02:32:49,220 --> 02:32:49,460
No!

2395
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:52,580
You ruined it!

2396
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:54,420
You ruined it!

2397
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:01,860
You ruined it!

2398
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,420
You ruined it!

2399

Please stand up.

2400
02:33:15,660 --> 02:33:16,380
Please stand up.

2401
02:33:28,450 --> 02:33:28,730
No.

2402
02:33:29,350 --> 02:33:29,650
No.

2403
02:33:35,780 --> 02:33:35,980
Uh.

2404
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:44,740
I don't know if this will work.

2405
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:47,960
Oh my

2406
02:33:57,400 --> 02:33:57,860
gosh.

2407
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:16,520
Oh, shoot.

2408
02:34:17,860 --> 02:34:18,420
Oh my gosh.

2409
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:19,140
Oh my gosh.

2410
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:20,040
Oh my gosh.

2411
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:22,400
Wait, wait, wait.

2412
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:23,880
I didn't even...

2413
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:24,460
No!

2414
02:34:30,010 --> 02:34:30,690
Gosh!

2415
02:34:38,600 --> 02:34:39,960
Babies assemble.

2416
02:34:45,080 --> 02:34:45,760
Okay.

2417
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:48,380
Okay.

2418
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:48,960
Okay.

2419
02:34:48,980 --> 02:34:49,140
All right.

2420
02:34:50,340 --> 02:34:50,980
All right.

2421
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:57,980
I saved it at a pretty bad spot, so they start coming in here immediately.

2422
02:34:58,580 --> 02:35:05,000
So I have to like, I have to get the turrets set up immediately.

2423
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:07,980
It was a good strat, though, for a bit.

2424
02:35:08,140 --> 02:35:14,600
If only I was able to kill that guy faster, he wouldn't have thrown the grenade and then totally thrown my entire thing off.

2425
02:35:18,680 --> 02:35:20,080
Reload the last auto-save.

2426
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:21,060
Actually, that's a good idea.

2427
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:21,580
Let's see.

2428
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:25,680
Auto-save.

2429
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:29,980
It's a little sooner than this one.

2430
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:30,600
Maybe we can.

2431
02:35:30,740 --> 02:35:31,120
Okay, hold on.

2432
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:33,840
Let's try loading it.

2433
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:35,420
Quick, get these set up.

2434
02:35:35,860 --> 02:35:37,980
I'm seeing soldiers in all directions.

2435
02:35:39,580 --> 02:35:39,740
Wait.

2436
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:40,840
Wait.

2437
02:35:41,540 --> 02:35:42,400
Oh, that's why.

2438
02:35:42,540 --> 02:35:43,060
I was like, hello.

2439
02:35:49,510 --> 02:35:49,850
Wait.

2440
02:35:50,230 --> 02:35:51,590
How do I turn you?

2441
02:35:52,290 --> 02:35:53,030
Turn, turn.

2442
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:55,750
Oh, that's me.

2443
02:35:55,990 --> 02:35:56,270
Sorry.

2444
02:35:57,630 --> 02:35:59,430
Okay, like that, maybe is good.

2445
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:17,760
Oh my gosh.

2446
02:36:18,420 --> 02:36:19,460
Wait, this is already bad.

2447
02:36:20,540 --> 02:36:20,960
Oh.

2448
02:36:21,700 --> 02:36:22,780
Get his ass!

2449
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:23,680
Get his ass!

2450
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:34,960
Please, Tart!

2451
02:36:35,140 --> 02:36:36,080
There we go!

2452
02:36:53,700 --> 02:36:54,480
More soldiers.

2453
02:36:55,960 --> 02:36:58,160
I don't like this at all.

2454
02:36:59,900 --> 02:37:00,920
I don't like this one bit.

2455
02:37:28,590 --> 02:37:29,510
I hate this!

2456
02:37:33,970 --> 02:37:35,290
You are such a...

2457
02:37:35,570 --> 02:37:36,790
Bitch!

2458
02:37:50,130 --> 02:37:50,130
I

2459
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:56,360
don't have much left.

2460
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:57,820
I think.

2461
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:00,320
No!

2462
02:38:02,620 --> 02:38:02,980
I'm

2463
02:38:07,330 --> 02:38:07,790
dead, I'm dead.

2464
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:08,850
I resigned my fate.

2465
02:38:17,140 --> 02:38:17,460
Ah!

2466
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:20,520
Ah!

2467
02:38:27,420 --> 02:38:27,880
Ah!

2468
02:38:28,540 --> 02:38:29,280
Ah!

2469
02:38:29,960 --> 02:38:30,540
Ah!

2470
02:38:34,130 --> 02:38:34,710
Ah!

2471
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:48,940
Yeah, maybe the corner strat is a little difficult.

2472
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:55,480
But I can't keep them too far away.

2473
02:38:56,180 --> 02:38:57,180
It's hard.

2474
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:01,680
Well, you can't keep them too far away because the soldiers will knock them out.

2475
02:39:03,360 --> 02:39:11,080
And so it's like you don't want to just be running around trying to, well, maybe that is the strat to just run in circles.

2476
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:21,680
You're so rude, Alex!

2477
02:39:27,130 --> 02:39:29,650
There's a place above the cells to camp in.

2478
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:32,290
Yeah, but how do I get three turrets up there?

2479
02:39:34,270 --> 02:39:35,550
How do I get three?

2480
02:39:39,270 --> 02:39:40,790
How do I get three turrets?

2481
02:39:44,490 --> 02:39:46,070
I'm just looking around real quick.

2482
02:39:47,910 --> 02:39:50,350
Okay, there's this, but I don't need it.

2483
02:39:53,350 --> 02:39:55,610
Maybe a room like this would be good.

2484
02:40:14,270 --> 02:40:15,430
Maybe this one?

2485
02:40:15,530 --> 02:40:17,690
Wait, this one had health too, no?

2486
02:40:19,090 --> 02:40:19,430
Yeah.

2487
02:40:19,790 --> 02:40:20,390
Oh, it does.

2488
02:40:24,790 --> 02:40:25,750
Try CQC.

2489
02:40:26,170 --> 02:40:26,710
I wish.

2490
02:40:35,310 --> 02:40:37,330
Kind of want to don't bunch them up for a single grenade.

2491
02:40:37,470 --> 02:40:38,110
knock everything out.

2492
02:40:38,290 --> 02:40:39,010
That's true, too.

2493
02:40:41,610 --> 02:40:42,830
That is so true.

2494
02:40:43,850 --> 02:40:46,010
I don't know what the best strat is for this, though.

2495
02:40:46,410 --> 02:40:47,210
Except survive.

2496
02:40:48,870 --> 02:40:50,190
Just live.

2497
02:40:51,250 --> 02:40:52,030
Naomi Hunter.

2498
02:40:55,030 --> 02:40:56,710
Wait, who isn't letting me super chat today?

2499
02:40:57,190 --> 02:40:59,010
Wait, I have to make a second account?

2500
02:40:59,710 --> 02:41:00,870
Oh my gosh.

2501
02:41:01,010 --> 02:41:02,970
Chimuru, wait, but you don't...

2502
02:41:02,970 --> 02:41:03,630
No!

2503
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:06,610
Thank you, though.

2504
02:41:06,650 --> 02:41:07,390
I'm so sorry.

2505
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:10,990
I'd make a second account to feel like you need to donate.

2506
02:41:14,370 --> 02:41:16,130
I don't know, guys.

2507
02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:17,270
I have no idea.

2508
02:41:17,830 --> 02:41:20,870
Sorry, my head is really starting to kill me, I think.

2509
02:41:21,370 --> 02:41:30,030
I don't want to stop here because this is such an annoying part that I will have to have to start up on.

2510
02:41:30,290 --> 02:41:33,710
But hey, this stream also started up on a pretty annoying part, too.

2511
02:41:35,830 --> 02:41:36,350
um,

2512
02:41:42,820 --> 02:41:44,320
You can't stop here.

2513
02:41:44,480 --> 02:41:46,040
I can if I'm not feeling well.

2514
02:41:49,160 --> 02:41:49,300
Ugh.

2515
02:41:50,820 --> 02:41:52,460
Might not be annoying if you don't have a headache.

2516
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:53,440
That's true, too.

2517
02:41:53,580 --> 02:41:58,820
I think I'll be able to think more clearly if I am not in pain, you know?

2518
02:42:01,060 --> 02:42:03,020
So, let's do that.

2519
02:42:04,240 --> 02:42:05,120
Sorry, guys.

2520
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:06,880
I'm not feeling so hot lately.

2521
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:09,340
I want to play Delta a lot tomorrow, though.

2522
02:42:09,700 --> 02:42:11,400
I hope that I don't have a headache.

2523
02:42:14,620 --> 02:42:15,980
I don't want to be sick.

2524
02:42:16,780 --> 02:42:17,760
I have too much to do.

2525
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:27,780
But I'm glad I could at least get in a little bit of half-life since I couldn't do it.

2526
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:30,680
Since I couldn't do it yesterday.

2527
02:42:33,560 --> 02:42:34,200
Yes, yes, yes.

2528
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:37,380
I'll take it easy after this then.

2529
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:39,380
Um, so...

2530
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:41,600
Uh...

2531
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:44,620
And I'll see about tomorrow if I need to move Delta.

2532
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:45,700
I hope not.

2533
02:42:46,300 --> 02:42:47,660
I wanted to play all day.

2534
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:50,220
But thank you guys!

2535
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:52,280
Thanks for the help with, uh...

2536
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:53,080
With the stuff too.

2537
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:54,960
Sorry again about the chat breaking.

2538
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:58,240
Um, I'm gonna go rest.

2539
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:00,980
And, uh...

2540
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:02,280
Try not to throw up.

2541
02:43:06,080 --> 02:43:06,600
Oh.

2542
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:07,920
Okay!

2543
02:43:08,620 --> 02:43:09,500
Thank you, everybody!

2544
02:43:09,820 --> 02:43:10,880
Thank you, thank you!

2545
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,280
And I'll let you guys know about tomorrow as soon as possible.

2546
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:18,160
More delta if it happens or not.

2547
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:24,660
And, uh...

2548
02:43:24,660 --> 02:43:25,060
Oh god.

2549
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:25,980
Hold on.

2550
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:28,760
I don't have any more water.

2551
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:30,040
Let me do this.

2552
02:43:33,140 --> 02:43:33,560
Okay.

2553
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:37,700
Let me do a hard save.

2554
02:43:40,280 --> 02:43:41,120
Thank you everybody.

2555
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:42,180
Bye-bye.

2556
02:43:42,200 --> 02:43:42,920
Bye-bye.

2557
02:43:43,060 --> 02:43:43,400
Sorry.

2558
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:44,060
Sorry.

2559
02:43:44,380 --> 02:43:44,820
Bye-bye.
