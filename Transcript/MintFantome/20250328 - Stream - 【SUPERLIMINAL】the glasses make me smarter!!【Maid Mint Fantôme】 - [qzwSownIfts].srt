1
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,010
Welcome home, master and princess.

2
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,430
Hello everybody.

3
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,230
Welcome to Super Liminal.

4
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:21,980
This music is making me so relaxed and chill.

5
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,980
I'm actually so sleepy.

6
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm actually so sleepy.

7
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,340
This is my technically third stream today.

8
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
Welcome to membership, thank you.

9
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,340
Tomodachi Life 2, I know.

10
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
I know!

11
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,680
Tomodachi Life 2.

12
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,480
The post, they made a Twitter post and it made me kind of emotional.

13
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,440
Because it was just like, after over 10 years, Tomodachi Life is back!

14
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,640
And I was like, 10 years?

15
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:15,040
I was looking at my physical copy that I have had since the beginning of Tomodachi Life.

16
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,160
Swamp Ghost, thank you so much for the 10 gift, thank you.

17
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,580
It's been 10 years, snake.

18
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,260
I love Tomodachi Life.

19
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,940
Looking mighty nerdy today.

20
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,100
Having witnessed your power to make it rain lemurs and force game announcements into existence.

21
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,060
Is your Pokemon evolution Oshikami?

22
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,280
Can the ghost become God?

23
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,300
And Dracos, thank you so much for the 20 gift, thank you.

24
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,220
Do I look nerdy?

25
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,560
Well, I have my glasses on this morning because I did not put my contacts in.

26
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,940
Because I knew I was going to go back to sleep.

27
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,420
And then, I kept them on obviously for the direct.

28
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,900
And then, I was like, well they make me smarter.

29
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,560
But I hate glasses on me.

30
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,640
Which would you prefer?

31
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,020
Twin tail?

32
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,280
Normal?

33
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,920
Long hair?

34
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,120
Witch?

35
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,560
Twin, twin, long, long twin.

36
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,980
You look super cute.

37
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,540
Frog?

38
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,480
Wait, sorry, every time I close, or I missed some.

39
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,420
Hot dog, hot dog.

40
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,060
Every time I, it's one of those types of games.

41
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,240
Don't worry, the game is chill.

42
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,600
I think the game is chill, right?

43
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,420
This game is chill, no?

44
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,420
Welcome everyone to one of the most chill games ever created.

45
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,060
Is it really?

46
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,520
Is this game really so chill?

47
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,320
Oh, thank goodness.

48
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,600
Oh, oh, sorry, I forgot to do that too.

49
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,200
There we go.

50
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,500
A high chance of motion sickness.

51
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,920
At best, you can look around more slowly.

52
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:26,720
Wait, what?

53
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,000
Like I have a high chance of motion sickness?

54
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,160
It's chill for like 95%.

55
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,040
As long as you don't get frustrated.

56
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,520
I can't tell if people are... I thought maybe it was like...

57
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,040
Especially like this background reminds me of like the parable, Stanley parable.

58
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,400
This game made me kind of barfy.

59
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,740
Really?

60
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,820
I don't get very motion sick from games, so...

61
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,800
As long as they're not like VR games, you know?

62
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,980
Oh, wow.

63
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,060
I guess we'll see if I get sick.

64
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,900
It's been a while since I've been able to catch a stream.

65
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,720
I hope you've been well.

66
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,640
Thank you, Flowerworks.

67
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,740
Welcome back.

68
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,260
Thank you, thank you.

69
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,420
It messes with your perception.

70
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,240
I see.

71
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,180
Well, I guess we'll just have to check it out.

72
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,180
Well, I guess that is a warning then.

73
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,060
An official warning for anybody who does get motion sick.

74
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,260
Be careful.

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,960
I'll do my best.

76
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,680
I already turned off the motion blur.

77
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,480
I might have to adjust the sensitivity, but I'll do my best to not make it...

78
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,560
So horrible.

79
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,640
I'll try, I'll try.

80
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,480
This menu music is chill.

81
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,220
I know!

82
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,840
Oh my gosh.

83
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,780
As soon as I was listening to this, I've been kind of listening to it while waiting for it to start.

84
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,400
And it kind of convinced me to buy the soundtrack.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,180
I was like, I kind of want to just...

86
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,440
This is like the kind of music I listen to when I'm like in my hotel room.

87
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,700
Just kind of vibing, like alone in Japan.

88
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,800
And I'll be like...

89
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,460
Today was so busy, I can just relax and listen to my jazz.

90
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,240
It's so nice.

91
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,040
Don't listen to those of weak constitution.

92
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,400
It kind of makes me want to talk like this.

93
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,940
Oh, that might have been my controller.

94
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,380
Oh, I forgot to ask.

95
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,700
Is this a controller game or a mouse game?

96
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,060
I don't... Is this a controller game or...

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,860
Mouse, mouse, mouse, both, okay.

98
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,540
I could have sworn we played this one.

99
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,580
No, I've never played this before.

100
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,100
Never ever in my afterlife.

101
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,180
Mouse and keyboard.

102
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,260
Cool.

103
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,460
Shall we start?

104
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,600
No game?

105
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,280
It's giving a warning.

106
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,380
Now I'm scared.

107
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,040
I'm going to go to work.

108
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,200
Byebye!

109
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,400
Byebye!

110
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,520
I love it.

111
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,060
I love this kind of...

112
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
I think it's safe.

113
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,900
I get a wife?

114
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,760
Oh no, it's one of those ads.

115
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,280
You wake up in the middle of the night and you're like...

116
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,980
There's like blaring in your room.

117
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,820
That's it.

118
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,840
Lumen Corporation!

119
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,160
Wait, I had to read it first, please.

120
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,420
Wait, I didn't...

121
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,920
I did not read what it said though.

122
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,810
Insert glasses are really versatile.

123
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,470
Copy-paste.

124
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,020
208.

125
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
My soul?

126
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,020
That's all I have.

127
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,200
That's all I am, is soul.

128
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,640
Perception is reality.

129
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,820
Grab.

130
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,980
How do I make it small?

131
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,620
Like so?

132
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh my god!

133
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,780
Joe, look at the membership!

134
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,940
Show me your kittens!

135
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,440
Thank you for the 10 gift toad!

136
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,040
Wait, can I rotate it?

137
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,480
Oh, there we go.

138
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,440
Wait, can I turn it upside down?

139
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,180
Okay.

140
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,480
I thought these were lemons, I'm not going to lie.

141
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,560
Okay.

142
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,000
How big can I make this?

143
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,200
Wait.

144
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,980
I can make it huge!

145
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,320
Cool!

146
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,210
Wait, so if I do...

147
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,990
How can I make it even bigger?

148
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,570
Wow!

149
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,250
I see.

150
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,610
I'm escaping this place.

151
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,470
You can't keep me here!

152
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,190
I'm already finding the way out!

153
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,760
What the...

154
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,680
You guys hear that?

155
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,260
Oh, it's just anytime I press.

156
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,620
Checkmate.

157
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,310
Get out of my way!

158
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,930
Somebody's watching us.

159
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,270
I always feel like somebody's watching me!

160
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,170
Terms of service accepted.

161
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,470
Congratulations on falling asleep.

162
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,250
Welcome to Somnascult.

163
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,550
Your progress may be monitored by qualified specialists.

164
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:29,270
This orientation will adapt you to eyelids, our interactive lucid induction dream state in which you retain full consciousness and control.

165
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,410
Okay.

166
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,390
What do you want me to do?

167
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,450
I don't know how to play this game actually.

168
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,050
Please don't make me.

169
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:39,370
Okay.

170
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,210
What...

171
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:44,930
Okay.

172
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,210
Nice.

173
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,810
Do I make everything really small or really big?

174
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,730
I don't know how to play this game.

175
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,430
Name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

176
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,250
Chess or liminal?

177
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,270
Chess.

178
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,950
I can only do sideways.

179
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,550
I'll tell you when it's a hot dog.

180
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,430
Oh, wait.

181
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,930
Oh, sorry Ducky, I missed yours.

182
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:35,090
I was watching your PS demo VOD while in a taxi and I lost it when you were laughing at Madagascar for 10 minutes.

183
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,890
The driver probably thought I was crazy.

184
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,530
I also learned KBBQ in Korea.

185
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,850
They cook for you.

186
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,170
Oh yeah, I've been to some KBBQ places that they cook for you.

187
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,530
It's always much nicer.

188
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,170
Can I make this bigger?

189
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,670
Oh, the motion sickness.

190
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,490
Thank you!

191
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,910
Lots of people caring about the motion sickness.

192
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,580
Bigger.

193
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Hot dog.

194
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,920
I guess it's big enough.

195
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,180
You.

196
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,960
Oh, see, that's a perfect size, no?

197
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,450
Pick it up while really close and look far away.

198
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,820
Excuse me.

199
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,040
I need you to become teeny tiny.

200
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,700
Wait, hold on.

201
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,520
Like so.

202
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,820
Tiny, teeny tiny enough.

203
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,880
Nope, nevermind.

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,080
Not teeny tiny enough.

205
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,440
Like so.

206
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,860
Which place is... It goes like there, right?

207
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,580
Where do they want me to...

208
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,460
I think I... I didn't think I need to play chess at all.

209
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,720
I think I just need to leave.

210
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,500
I understand now.

211
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,360
The puzzle.

212
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,540
Once again, I'm overcomplicating.

213
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:12,640
I'm overcomplicating.

214
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,160
No objects beyond this point at all times.

215
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,920
I made it really tiny.

216
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,260
Oh, but we need an object.

217
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,830
It'll work eventually.

218
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,730
Yeah.

219
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,490
Can I grab this guy from all...

220
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,730
You think you can fool me?

221
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,170
I'll even make your desk tiny.

222
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,430
Oh, I need it back though, please.

223
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,320
Nice.

224
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,800
Easy peasy.

225
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,420
Oh.

226
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,780
I don't care!

227
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,320
Well, I thought it was a regular piece.

228
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,120
Oh my gosh, have you guys ever been to those science museums that have like...

229
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,220
The rooms where they like...

230
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,240
Show your heat...

231
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,420
Like your heat on the walls and...

232
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,120
And like they're all optical illusion things and...

233
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,480
I love those types of museums!

234
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,400
And this is just like that.

235
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,400
Okay.

236
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,520
Okay.

237
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,760
What do you want me to do about it?

238
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,500
Hope you and your cats are well.

239
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,440
Thank you!

240
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,340
I actually had to take my cat to the vet recently.

241
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,820
Wait, can this go through?

242
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,520
Okay, there we go.

243
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,400
Like there?

244
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:56,960
Heck yeah.

245
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,280
He's okay.

246
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,340
It was Butaro.

247
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,260
He started throwing up again recently and I was worried about him but...

248
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,240
I get the test results back soon.

249
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,640
But a general look at him, they said he was fine.

250
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,960
He wasn't losing weight or anything, so...

251
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,940
Hold right click to rotate.

252
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,840
Yeah, but it doesn't rotate very well.

253
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,730
So much cheese.

254
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,330
Aston Martin would be so cheesed...

255
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,130
About this part of the game.

256
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,830
Wait, there we go.

257
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,100
Wait, I made it smaller.

258
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,580
You think it's big enough?

259
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,220
No, bigger.

260
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,360
That Nikkei when they made Breddy.

261
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:03,920
Bigger.

262
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,420
No, no, no.

263
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,120
Big.

264
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,700
No, no.

265
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,500
Bigger, bigger, bigger.

266
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,940
Have you guys seen that new Nikkei girl?

267
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,600
How do I make it bigger?

268
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,480
How do I make it so huge?

269
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,520
Look up with it?

270
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,370
Am I gonna die?

271
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,530
This is how Mint gets to the top shelf with cheese.

272
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,750
Wait, what are all these alarms though?

273
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,530
Or they're not alarms, they're just clocks, but...

274
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,190
Who would have their alarm at 12.05?

275
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,970
That would be craziness.

276
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,130
How do I say your name?

277
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,110
Look at the membership.

278
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,330
Daniel, thank you so much for the 5 gift.

279
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,650
Oh boy, 12.05 AM.

280
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,330
What is that, a balloon?

281
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,950
There was no other place for me to go.

282
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,790
Patient safety is a key note in our corporate priority tetrahedron.

283
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,490
A variable degree of force can and will be authorized to ensure patient safety.

284
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,310
Please return to the orientation pathway.

285
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,190
If I stick my finger...

286
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,950
If Dreamself sticks my finger into the socket...

287
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,710
Will we still be okay?

288
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,170
What do you guys want?

289
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,710
Red soda, green soda, diet soda, random soda, baking soda, mini soda, water soda?

290
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,650
Which one?

291
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,250
I'm making green soda.

292
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,310
Please use the other door.

293
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,140
What other door?

294
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,340
Hey, what's up there?

295
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,420
So if I look up...

296
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,720
Wait.

297
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,200
Oh no, I gotta be close to it, my bad.

298
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,450
Be close.

299
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,170
We'll get it.

300
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,690
That's how we're gonna get up there.

301
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,250
Whatever this...

302
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,910
Why is it getting so small?

303
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,550
Come on.

304
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,380
Close or far.

305
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,820
I made it teeny.

306
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,720
The teeniest, tiniest ever.

307
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,050
How small can I make this soda?

308
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,880
Wait, can I even grab it?

309
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,620
Oh my god, I can.

310
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,940
It's so tiny.

311
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,610
This game has a really nice message attached to it.

312
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,490
Hope you finish it.

313
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,110
You got this, Mito.

314
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,210
Thank you!

315
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,210
Soda for ants.

316
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,430
Okay, we'll do the random soda.

317
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,830
What did we get?

318
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,490
We got...

319
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,110
It's still rolling.

320
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,210
Oh, it's actually just called a random soda.

321
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,380
Why am I so bad at making it bigger?

322
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,760
Getting there.

323
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,820
I don't even know if that's actually anything.

324
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,500
But I wanna try.

325
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,780
You might need another one.

326
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,380
Oh, maybe.

327
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,420
Tiny soda.

328
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,740
Tiny soda is our only hope.

329
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,570
I think I broke the soda.

330
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,730
And the soda.

331
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,960
Why is this one so big?

332
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,820
Oh my god.

333
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,140
Okay, alright.

334
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,320
Am I actually getting anywhere you guys?

335
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,860
Am I really breaking the game right now?

336
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,830
What is this?

337
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,030
That's what you wanted me to do.

338
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,440
Where does that go to though?

339
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,070
You like my idea more?

340
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,250
That was the speaker.

341
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:52,930
There are...

342
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:19,270
Actually, I can't tell what is the intended method here.

343
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,640
I can't really tell.

344
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,440
Oh, I see.

345
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,380
Down there.

346
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,760
You like my puzzle solving strats?

347
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,280
Thank you.

348
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
Can I just...

349
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,200
Oh,

350
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,090
whoopsie.

351
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,710
I thought I would roll enough momentum.

352
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,290
You know.

353
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,990
Put my hands long.

354
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,450
It's a dream.

355
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,010
If you can think it, you can dream it.

356
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,370
How do I get it in there?

357
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,530
Yeah, it does have a jump button.

358
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,580
Try doing it from the middle glass.

359
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,340
I can't grab it from there.

360
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,600
Pretty blue...

361
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:44,980
Wait.

362
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,420
My eyes magnify my...wait.

363
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,520
Blue eyes plus glasses plus men plus maid equals taking over the world.

364
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,420
Place it directly?

365
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,960
I was trying to before, but it didn't work.

366
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,720
Please provide a comprehensive rational explanation in your post-procedural survey.

367
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Completed surveys may be eligible for a gift card.

368
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,380
This game...

369
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,520
Reminds me of Ivespy.

370
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,430
No items.

371
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,810
People without items beyond this point will be fine.

372
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,610
I'll be fine.

373
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,750
They will be fine.

374
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,810
I think you...

375
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,810
Missed a really important letter there.

376
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,700
It's like an extremely important letter.

377
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,860
Really, no objects beyond this point at all times.

378
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,960
Then how do I... I did it before.

379
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,460
I see.

380
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,480
Gamers don't look up.

381
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,210
Wait, how do I get it all the way up there though?

382
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:48,530
Bigger?

383
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,770
Can I even make it any bigger?

384
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,550
Bigger.

385
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,290
Bigger!

386
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,270
Bigger!

387
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,830
Holy cow!

388
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,530
Ok, hold on.

389
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,200
Because I imagine I use it...

390
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,880
You guys... Hold on.

391
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,080
Please don't... Please don't...

392
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,520
Just yell the answers.

393
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,620
You guys, I'm trying to figure it out.

394
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:58,940
Please.

395
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,170
Thank you.

396
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,740
Yeah, no help unless I ask for it.

397
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,800
No help unless I ask for it.

398
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,700
But what I...

399
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,720
Can I... Can I...

400
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,250
Can I get it like...

401
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,400
What?

402
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,710
Maybe from over here.

403
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,260
I did it!

404
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,620
Put this towards some celebratory treats for when your cat feels better.

405
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,480
Thank you!

406
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,720
See, I didn't need no help.

407
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,560
Oh.

408
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,260
Mysterious.

409
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,960
Oh, not lemons.

410
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,260
Oh, there's so many ways to go.

411
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,340
No, there's not so many ways to go.

412
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,660
Wait, it's all the same.

413
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,700
Oh, oh.

414
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,980
Wait, what?

415
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,360
This one too?

416
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,520
Oh, this one too?

417
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,060
Can I just keep going forever?

418
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,770
Spot the anomalies.

419
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,250
Oh no.

420
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,600
Why is this one crooked?

421
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,680
Okay.

422
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,560
And then this one...

423
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,560
I can't take it.

424
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,850
Can I...

425
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,370
Oh, it kicks me out.

426
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,480
It's time to thonk.

427
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,560
I'm always thonking.

428
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,420
Can I...

429
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,600
Gosh, can I make it big enough to where it covers both?

430
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,170
Oh, so, so, so, so close.

431
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,550
Wait, wait, wait.

432
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,700
Wait, I think I need to get close.

433
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,630
I can't even see it when I move it like that.

434
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,040
Hi!

435
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,400
Hold it close and look up?

436
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,420
Yeah, I tried that.

437
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,780
I think I'm just not good at it sometimes.

438
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,240
Fall over, please?

439
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,820
Maybe if I push it.

440
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,300
Now it doesn't.

441
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,800
Final?

442
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,560
Why is it...

443
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,420
What can we see through here?

444
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,680
Oh cheese.

445
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,480
That.

446
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,700
No cheese.

447
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,800
I was wondering if you are listening to Zutomayo.

448
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,480
If so, what's your favorite song?

449
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,940
I know Zutomayo, but I can't say that I've listened to them very much.

450
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,740
I will check out your favorite.

451
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,340
Cheese.

452
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,820
Do we...

453
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,660
Make it big again?

454
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,400
Do we make our world famous cheese platform?

455
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,360
Push!

456
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,400
Push?

457
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,760
Wedge it?

458
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,240
Wait, in between here?

459
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,760
Is that even possible?

460
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,360
I thought I was going to...

461
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,760
We didn't need to wedge it.

462
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,520
We just needed to break it.

463
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,660
I just needed to destroy everything.

464
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,640
What do you guys think?

465
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,520
I'm stupid?

466
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,280
This company.

467
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,040
They think I'm so dumb?

468
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,580
They're like, she'll never beat all the puzzles.

469
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,480
Break stuff.

470
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,600
Excuse me.

471
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,480
Excuse me.

472
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,260
If I... I must cheese you a question.

473
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,460
Can't pick any of this stuff up.

474
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,460
Ok.

475
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:22,790
Loading!

476
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:26,590
Loading!

477
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,910
Are your plushies still available?

478
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,330
I think we had to close it for now.

479
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,810
3 AM?

480
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,250
That's a spooky hour.

481
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,130
Are we still in the dream or...

482
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,790
Sweet F?

483
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,990
It was in Sweet B.

484
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,520
Private.

485
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,920
It was suddenly the start of the Stanley Parable for real.

486
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,920
Anybody here?

487
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,240
Sweet F for freaky.

488
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,280
Wait, how to start it?

489
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,500
Wait, what does it say?

490
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,070
How to start it?

491
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:22,750
I can't tell.

492
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,730
Is the soda still free?

493
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,920
Sorry to the poor sapoo.

494
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,060
Someone comes into work and they're just like, gosh, I just really want a soda this morning.

495
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,040
Cheese.

496
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:45,720
Cheese!

497
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,680
Red rum, red rum.

498
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,030
Some doors are best left closed.

499
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,220
I still can't take anything yet.

500
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,040
Should we leave?

501
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,700
We could go that way or we could go this way.

502
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,720
Pull the fire alarm.

503
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,480
Wait, here?

504
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,800
I can do that?

505
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,700
Are there more fire alarms to pull?

506
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,200
I've always wanted to pull one before.

507
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:00,490
She's a ghost so I'm going to try and contact her on the Ouija board at 3am.

508
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,750
Do not attempt this because it is extremely dangerous.

509
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,450
That was a good job on that puzzle, thank you.

510
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,210
Couldn't have done Cheddar myself.

511
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,470
This game is going to be a breeze for you.

512
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,250
I hate being a big person.

513
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,410
I hate being the bigger person.

514
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,810
Well then obviously we need to go this way.

515
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,780
The numbers on this don't make any sense at all.

516
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,340
This one you can pretty easily tell, I'm not going to lie.

517
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,200
Maybe if you get it from just the middle.

518
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,300
Exactly the middle it looks good.

519
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,260
A little Looney Tunes style.

520
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,960
This room looks trippy too.

521
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,040
Wait, there was another exit door.

522
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,000
Let's go check that out.

523
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,280
Exit temporarily moved.

524
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,080
Ok, so we definitely have to go that way.

525
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:41,080
Just got Minto Goods today and the mouse pad is very buffed.

526
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,800
Oh, mouse pad.

527
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,740
That's not official.

528
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,260
But thank you.

529
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,930
We are on the movie set.

530
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:10,890
Exit, exit.

531
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,610
Exit, exit.

532
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,330
How about if I shaman myself?

533
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,410
Probably won't need a Ouija board.

534
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,650
I think it's fun to talk on the Ouija board though.

535
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,090
It's kind of like texting.

536
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,050
Hey girl, how old are you?

537
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,070
Hey girl, ASL.

538
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:43,010
Like that, you know?

539
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,880
Wait, what can I interact with?

540
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,920
Because...

541
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,080
Oh no, can I pick up anything?

542
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,340
This?

543
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:09,900
No.

544
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:09,960
No.

545
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,420
You?

546
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,080
No.

547
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,450
Something green?

548
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,590
Thank you!

549
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,260
My bad.

550
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,380
My bad.

551
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,380
My bad.

552
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,800
Push!

553
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,300
No, no, not me!

554
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,920
No, no, no!

555
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,960
Maybe like... I wish I could tilt it, you know?

556
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm trying to make a ramp.

557
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,060
But a big ramp, you know?

558
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,680
See, every time I pick it up it makes it so small.

559
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,550
That works.

560
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:55,390
Staircon?

561
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,370
Well, better than Sawcon.

562
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:07,910
Probably.

563
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:20,390
Neat.

564
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:31,830
Oh!

565
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,070
Like you're trying to find me?

566
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:45,630
Or...

567
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,850
Because I don't want to be found.

568
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,510
Oh, what's this?

569
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:51,050
They're plans.

570
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,510
They're big plans.

571
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:55,690
New cube design.

572
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:56,510
Too much?

573
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:57,790
Materials.

574
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:58,650
Aluminum plastic.

575
00:47:58,890 --> 00:47:59,790
Symmetrical layout.

576
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:00,730
Table table.

577
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,570
Cloud insert.

578
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,230
Order more red paint.

579
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:05,710
Math.

580
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:06,850
Projection.

581
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,350
Eggshell.

582
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:09,830
I'm a pirate.

583
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,380
What else is around here?

584
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,260
Blue.

585
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,360
It must have...

586
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:23,530
I...

587
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,370
I'm...

588
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,730
I'm a genius, I think.

589
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:27,370
I drew those.

590
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,710
I drew that.

591
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,680
Sawcon these.

592
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,040
Every time you say the Sawcon.

593
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,420
Every time.

594
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,880
You have to bring up these.

595
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,760
Wait, what did I just do?

596
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,700
Oh, I think I...

597
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,620
We had a brief moment of music.

598
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:16,690
The illusion of choice?

599
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,190
The exit sign has light for dark places.

600
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,090
Thank you.

601
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,310
That's so smart.

602
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,920
And I'm not gonna get everything, you guys.

603
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,520
So it's okay if I miss some stuff.

604
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:37,820
Oh, wait.

605
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,580
Oh, it's not as bright as I thought it would be.

606
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,980
It actually doesn't do anything.

607
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,160
It actually does nothing.

608
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:08,290
Okay.

609
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,750
People are saying I missed a fire alarm.

610
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:12,310
It's okay.

611
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,090
Oh, here it is.

612
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:25,490
Oh,

613
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:29,630
wait.

614
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:31,850
It's one of these.

615
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:34,130
Where you line it up perfectly.

616
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:35,930
Probably from back here.

617
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:42,370
Wow!

618
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,040
Cute.

619
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,120
No, very scary.

620
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Perception is reality!

621
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:04,670
Another one.

622
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,750
Is that a bullet or...

623
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:07,870
Oh no, it's part of the table.

624
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,250
Oh, there is a lot of them.

625
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,730
Another cube.

626
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:19,450
Okay, okay.

627
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,810
Please, that's like basically perfect.

628
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:27,510
That was so perfect.

629
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:30,710
Hello?

630
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,480
Hello?

631
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,560
It's basically...Oh, I have to grab it.

632
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,780
It's not a cube at all.

633
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,020
It's not a cube.

634
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,980
Roars and gowls.

635
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,630
Oh, it becomes like a staircase.

636
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,260
There is some slight collision physics.

637
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,760
Bigger?

638
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,620
I like the soundtrack for this game so much.

639
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,600
The exit.

640
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,020
Hmm...

641
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,500
I mean the...Hello?

642
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,000
Hello?

643
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,360
Hello?

644
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,640
What can I grab here?

645
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:08,560
Pictures?

646
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:09,920
Picture?

647
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:10,900
Picture?

648
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,300
Picture?

649
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:14,880
Picture?

650
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:21,320
Now you guys are making me want to pull all these.

651
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,400
Now you guys are making me want to pull all these.

652
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,860
I probably missed some already though, no?

653
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,220
You don't have to.

654
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,520
I'll try and get all that I can.

655
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,860
It's the right thing to do.

656
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,360
Can we bring the staircase box?

657
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,340
Good question.

658
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,940
I love your dredge playthroughs.

659
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,780
Oh, thank you!

660
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,680
I'm still working on playing it.

661
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,680
For your inevitable sea shanty karaoke messages, looking up the band Longest Jawns.

662
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,700
Hoist that up the thing.

663
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,880
Seems like a perfect theme song.

664
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,100
I'll look into it, thank you.

665
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,040
Wait, eh?

666
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,680
What am I doing wrong?

667
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,560
There we go.

668
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,120
No, no, no.

669
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:31,720
Oh gosh.

670
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,900
Okay, okay.

671
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,720
Raiders?

672
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,200
Nyaruto!

673
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,360
Thank you for the raid!

674
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,740
Thank you, thank you!

675
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,120
This is my first time playing Super Liminal.

676
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,660
And...oh yeah, what's this?

677
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,470
Is this a hint?

678
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,490
Remac, thanks for the 5 gifted!

679
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:10,490
RugbyRabbit, thanks for the 5 gifted!

680
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,730
Doharku, thanks for the 5 gifted!

681
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:13,730
Thank you guys!

682
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,670
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

683
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,130
And Draco, thanks for the 5 gifted!

684
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,130
Uh-oh, this is my staircase now.

685
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,030
I messed it up.

686
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,540
Murphy, thanks for the 5 gifted!

687
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,880
GDontcha, thanks for the 5 gifted!

688
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,740
Hold on, I missed one.

689
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,820
CC, thank you for the 5 gifted!

690
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,540
Thank you guys!

691
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:43,820
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

692
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,420
Resume.

693
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,280
We did it!

694
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,320
We're back into the spooky.

695
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,280
Oh, purple.

696
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:13,970
What's this?

697
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,120
Oh my god.

698
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,260
What is this?

699
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,640
It's just a room of stars?

700
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,240
Secret area?

701
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,900
The edge of the universe?

702
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,520
The meaning of...

703
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,620
What did I just hear?

704
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:58,150
Is there anything to do here except just stare at the pretty room?

705
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,950
Can I grab a star?

706
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,130
I could really use a wish.

707
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,970
Right now!

708
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:15,230
Wish right now!

709
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,120
Interesting.

710
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,320
Star bottom right.

711
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,700
You just...

712
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,060
That's your zodiac?

713
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,900
Yeah, me too.

714
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,300
Wait, is it make anything else except a table?

715
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,860
I noticed that there was like a large cluster, so I figured it was something.

716
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,120
You're my bestie, you.

717
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:53,260
Me!

718
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,660
Yeah, everybody now, if you're just like on, you know, a date and...

719
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,800
Person's like, what's your zodiac sign?

720
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,720
You could be like...

721
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,380
Table.

722
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,820
It's like, you know...

723
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,940
One of the rarest zodiacs to get.

724
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,240
I think there's a cup.

725
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,660
Oh wait, this is like right here.

726
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,940
Looks like it could be something.

727
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:25,770
Or like...

728
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,670
This like cluster here.

729
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:36,780
I'm trying to use my third eye.

730
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,120
Oh wait, there's here too.

731
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,120
This also look like a cluster, no?

732
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,060
Yeah, an anime girl told me that's my...

733
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:53,860
This too!

734
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,960
That's my sign.

735
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,400
So, you know, just...

736
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,600
But you have four eyes.

737
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,700
Who you calling four eyes?

738
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:10,940
Who you calling?

739
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,600
Pushes on my glasses.

740
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:19,710
Guys, I think I'm blind.

741
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,470
I can't see anything other than the table.

742
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,180
Do you guys see anything else?

743
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,180
This is harder than finding hidden Mickey's.

744
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,100
That's why you wear glasses.

745
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,300
What's your prescription on your glasses again?

746
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,200
I don't know what my prescription on my glasses is, but my left eye is...

747
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,220
Negative 3.5 for contacts and my right eye is negative 4.

748
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,100
See the most beautiful ghost in the world.

749
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,130
It's only one unsecret room.

750
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,950
At least we found the table.

751
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:18,510
Cool.

752
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:24,830
I like that room.

753
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:29,410
Oh the professor.

754
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:31,670
Doctor.

755
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:39,810
We still don't know.

756
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:48,190
But please keep moving forward and hopefully you prefer frequent updates to being reminded that you are completely lost.

757
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:50,270
Thank you doctor.

758
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,670
Doctor, doctor.

759
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:01,390
Rice and shipping box.

760
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,450
Rice cakes and assorted candies.

761
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:03,710
Candies.

762
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:07,870
It wasn't here.

763
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:19,580
I went to the eye doctor this week and they told me I legally shouldn't be driving.

764
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,540
So I'm getting glasses soon.

765
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,920
Astigmatism gang, rise up.

766
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,520
Wait, you did not know that you couldn't see?

767
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,360
How did you not know?

768
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,520
I don't know what I'm doing or how to support but take money.

769
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,660
Custom music, thank you.

770
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,980
I love the rookie numbers.

771
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,040
I'm 7-0 in both eyes, that's insane.

772
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,080
Zkinator, thank you so much for the pink.

773
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,240
If you were the stars I would devote...

774
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,760
Is this a poem?

775
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,580
I'm gonna get embarrassed.

776
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,460
Thank you for the pink.

777
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,410
Four eyes for life.

778
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,110
Yeah, pretty much.

779
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,430
Pretty much, you know.

780
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,950
What can I interact with here?

781
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:36,500
Yeah, how did you not know that you could not see that badly?

782
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,020
Is my question.

783
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,050
Nice riz.

784
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:45,070
Okay, I'll read it.

785
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:45,750
I'll read it.

786
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:46,350
Oh my gosh.

787
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:47,690
Fine, I'll read it.

788
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,790
I'm embarrassed though.

789
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:54,550
If you were the star I would devote my life to being an astronomer.

790
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:57,270
If only to begin to understand your beauty.

791
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:04,750
If I were to stare at your eyes forever, I would tell people I saw the entire galaxy without even looking at the sky.

792
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,860
Like staring at our screens all day is bad.

793
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,860
No, my eyes have been this bad.

794
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,840
Ever since I was a wee wisp.

795
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:21,940
Well, they've gotten worse.

796
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:26,180
They used to be like 2 point something and now they're 4 point something.

797
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,480
I can see which shapes are cars because they go low.

798
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,840
As the one computer science major that doesn't need glasses, I say skill issue.

799
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,780
I'm old and still have 2018 vision.

800
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,840
Get rekt, nerds.

801
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,740
How old are we talking?

802
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,380
It's not a competition.

803
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,980
I'm not here to be like...

804
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,760
I'm not bragging about my prescription.

805
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,600
Do you guys see anything in here that we can interact with?

806
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,320
I don't see anything.

807
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:07,860
Well,

808
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,880
that's why I wear contacts, because I don't like my glasses.

809
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,420
Think cube, the green wall.

810
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,540
I thought I needed to be up here for it, though.

811
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,300
I don't think I can get it unless I'm upstairs.

812
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,520
Yeah, I'm not tall enough.

813
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,100
Oh my god, I didn't even see the cube!

814
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,160
I see it now.

815
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,380
Yay!

816
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,600
Oh wait...

817
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:33,860
Yes, yes, use your arms!

818
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:33,940
Use your arms.

819
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:37,960
Wait,

820
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,260
then what about this room?

821
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,340
I like this game.

822
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,720
Okay, before we go through this exit...

823
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,880
Why is there a tiny door?

824
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,320
Maybe it needs to be bigger.

825
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:11,940
Nevermind.

826
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,710
What about this door?

827
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:21,930
And our green cube we got all of a sudden.

828
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:24,850
It's father and son.

829
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:29,090
Yes.

830
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:33,010
Yes, papa.

831
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:35,570
Telling lies?

832
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:36,450
No, papa.

833
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,170
Open your mouth.

834
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,270
What if I do like this?

835
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:47,370
What if I can crawl on here?

836
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,860
I think it's really sturdy.

837
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,860
Okay, I'm gonna go... wait.

838
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:08,020
Oh, I think I messed up.

839
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:12,800
Okay.

840
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,720
Okay, we're good.

841
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,850
I'm gonna go through this one first.

842
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,540
This

843
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,060
area seems... not good.

844
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,300
Okay.

845
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,680
Hold on, I'm getting a cough drop.

846
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,540
Guys, it's bad.

847
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,820
I have a recording tomorrow.

848
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,300
My voice is so bad.

849
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,900
I think I messed up.

850
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,020
I think I messed up.

851
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,880
Good luck, thank you.

852
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,660
Okay, thank you cube.

853
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,620
I need to see what's in this area for real.

854
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,720
Oh, wow.

855
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,120
Now if I use this chest...

856
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,820
Can I jump up?

857
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,340
No, okay.

858
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,420
Yes!

859
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:02,520
Yes!

860
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:03,720
Yes!

861
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,640
Just finished 45 minutes straight on my old workout bike.

862
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,260
Nice!

863
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,760
I have a recording tomorrow.

864
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,900
I guess I'll stream three times.

865
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,460
I was... I don't know.

866
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,720
What kind of dice?

867
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,020
Is that a gnome?

868
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:21,740
What is that?

869
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:23,400
Sterecon!

870
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,560
More Sterecon.

871
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:48,160
Oops.

872
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,540
Roll the dice.

873
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,300
Oh, it's apples!

874
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:04,340
Sterecon...

875
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,160
Three.

876
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:15,950
Or one.

877
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:20,470
I don't understand this one.

878
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,220
Holy cow.

879
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,460
I don't get this one.

880
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,660
It's always a one!

881
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,240
It's rigged!

882
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,260
It's rigged!

883
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:38,900
It's rigged!

884
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,020
I

885
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:48,030
don't really get it though.

886
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:57,390
Thank you!

887
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:57,550
Thank you!

888
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,870
Is it that?

889
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:07,150
Since that's like...

890
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,150
Since it's like kind of...

891
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,390
Like it's kind of green.

892
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:15,390
Like the chess piece.

893
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:19,890
Makes me think that we could... I don't know.

894
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:24,710
I think it's just an easter egg.

895
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:27,370
Maybe.

896
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:33,300
Maybe.

897
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,520
Okay, let's go.

898
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:40,110
Hello Minto.

899
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:41,530
Hello!

900
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:43,770
Hello.

901
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:45,850
Hello.

902
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:47,730
Why would it be there then though?

903
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,760
That is...

904
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:17,220
925-ish?

905
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,700
About?

906
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,320
1025?

907
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:24,620
1025?

908
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,820
Watching you stream made it feel like easy breezy.

909
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,140
I haven't done my workout today.

910
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,000
I was too lazy.

911
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,040
Well, not lazy.

912
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:38,920
I was too tired.

913
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,400
I was definitely too tired and didn't do my workout.

914
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:43,540
Is that okay?

915
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,640
Is it okay if I didn't do my workout today?

916
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,860
Please say yes.

917
01:12:58,030 --> 01:12:58,850
It's okay?

918
01:12:58,850 --> 01:12:58,870
It's okay?

919
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,090
I won't miss it again.

920
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:06,170
I don't know about that.

921
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,090
Get back to it tomorrow.

922
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:11,450
Yes mom.

923
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:14,870
Yes mom.

924
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,830
Wow!

925
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,950
You can really see the moon now.

926
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:24,850
Trying to find...

927
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:27,750
Something to use.

928
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,100
Any dice?

929
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,900
Shoot for the moon Minto.

930
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,160
Wait, you think I can grab it?

931
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:22,260
For example, if you see your parents, please punch them in the face as hard as you can and immediately run away.

932
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:28,380
Wow you guys, I give you the moon.

933
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,100
Look, look, look.

934
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,500
Now you can really say it.

935
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,880
Say it, say it.

936
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,420
Say the line, say the line.

937
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,420
I didn't do my workout today.

938
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,820
I didn't do any work because I was laid off!

939
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,420
I'm laid off!

940
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:51,570
The moon is beautiful.

941
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,640
What do you want?

942
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,020
The moon?

943
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,240
Well then how about I lasso it for you?

944
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,520
Good job team, good job team.

945
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:15,360
Okay so now we have to probably precariously stack these up I imagine.

946
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,020
Wait, come here.

947
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,500
Come here you.

948
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,780
Wait, what's on the other side?

949
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,440
The exit!

950
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:30,840
Wait, I thought I was having to go up.

951
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:32,980
But no, I go through.

952
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:44,130
Can I go up still?

953
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:48,190
Can I go up?

954
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:03,200
We are going to need a big old cheese...

955
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,580
ramp for a big block.

956
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,340
Okay, big enough of a cheese ramp I think.

957
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,290
That scared the heck out of me.

958
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:25,630
It scared the heck out of me.

959
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:26,170
Oh my gosh.

960
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:29,350
Big cheese.

961
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,510
Do you think we can make it outside?

962
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,850
If you were the moon, I'd be the tides.

963
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,510
Naturally draw it to you?

964
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,030
What is this?

965
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:56,910
Oh wait, I think I made it small.

966
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,230
No!

967
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:03,760
Big old cheese.

968
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,400
Come

969
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,030
on, come on.

970
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:12,130
Yes, yes, no!

971
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,070
Yes, yes, yes!

972
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:15,130
No!

973
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,880
Is it a razor clock or something?

974
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,340
I don't know, you tell me.

975
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,160
Use the moon!

976
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,580
I think I need to be far away from the moon.

977
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:45,230
Just kidding.

978
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:48,390
Wait, why does it make it so small?

979
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:53,730
How do I make it bigger?

980
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,190
Because the moon floats, it's kind of hard.

981
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,400
You grab from afar.

982
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,380
That's what I tried doing.

983
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,240
Let me try again.

984
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,020
All the way.

985
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:08,560
You

986
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,600
pick up close and release...

987
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,800
There we go!

988
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:42,190
There we go!

989
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,590
Thank you so much for that!

990
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,270
We made it!

991
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,110
There is something up here!

992
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:02,770
I think I need the soda can.

993
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,620
I want to get up there again first.

994
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:39,160
Ok, there we go.

995
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,900
Is it grab the moon again maybe?

996
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:42,900
Maybe.

997
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:44,680
We

998
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:56,610
made it!

999
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:59,550
Creepy, creepy.

1000
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:03,390
Popcorn!

1001
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,810
We made it!

1002
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:07,830
We made it!

1003
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:13,130
I don't like it with the lights off though, it's freaking me out.

1004
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:22,010
There's clocks here, there's not there.

1005
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:28,370
The sky is fake, it's because of the light.

1006
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,560
No!

1007
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:35,320
I turned them all off.

1008
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,040
That's so sad.

1009
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,760
Bye music.

1010
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,400
I know it gets really creepy in these areas.

1011
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:51,040
Is there a...

1012
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:53,800
Whatchamacallit?

1013
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:57,120
A fire alarm that I can pull?

1014
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,380
Doesn't seem to be the case.

1015
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,560
Well we made it!

1016
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,640
We made it!

1017
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,280
We made it!

1018
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,260
We made it!

1019
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,200
Good job team.

1020
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:16,200
Check the blue...the what?

1021
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,380
Blueprint?

1022
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,220
Where do you see it?

1023
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:26,900
Blueprint.

1024
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,500
On the other side of the room.

1025
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,160
This?

1026
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,100
Oh I see.

1027
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,640
Thank you guys, I totally missed it.

1028
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:41,820
It's a blueprint.

1029
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:44,880
Wow.

1030
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,340
Wow.

1031
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,260
What's this door?

1032
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:53,720
Freaky.

1033
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,360
Oh we got that, that's neat.

1034
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,820
It's so blue, I know.

1035
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,240
Let's keep the lights on.

1036
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,440
Let's keep the lights on, it's prettier this way, no?

1037
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:10,360
Even if it's fake, even if it's fake.

1038
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,880
The blueprints are obviously for Metal Gear.

1039
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:27,800
Alright, that's enough...being silly.

1040
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,300
Onwards!

1041
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,530
Don't get lost.

1042
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:38,850
Beer fund $5 Dakota.

1043
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:41,090
Regular person 3-5 dreams per night.

1044
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:41,430
Really?

1045
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:44,070
Don't meet sister-in-law.

1046
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:47,230
What if there is a fire in elevator?

1047
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:50,690
Nobody answered that one.

1048
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:51,710
Can I write it?

1049
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,090
Seize the day.

1050
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:01,770
Oh I'm a ghost.

1051
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:06,230
Other Somnoscope resorts are waiting for you.

1052
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:10,470
Now Metal Gear...

1053
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:13,930
I think my loading bar is broken.

1054
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,840
Oh we woke up again!

1055
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,720
Good morning Mito!

1056
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,960
We are in the same place.

1057
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,760
As before.

1058
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,500
Is this one working?

1059
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:44,620
It's not working.

1060
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:16,840
It's not my fault.

1061
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,300
Dice.

1062
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,420
Warning, dice.

1063
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:28,260
It's not my fault I think.

1064
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:30,380
Probably.

1065
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,960
Curators only.

1066
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,880
Rating schema.

1067
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,900
Perception is real.

1068
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,790
The same guy?

1069
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:59,030
No, no, no, no.

1070
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:00,010
Oh there is a dice.

1071
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:07,230
This one is also apples.

1072
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:10,790
Excuse me.

1073
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:11,290
There we go.

1074
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:17,310
You can't contain me.

1075
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:24,980
I almost missed it.

1076
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,940
I don't know if this dice is loaded too.

1077
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,760
Seems like this place is a whole bunch of phonies.

1078
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,200
Bunch of phonies.

1079
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:47,600
Wait just like, this is half a dice.

1080
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:52,840
The other half?

1081
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:01,900
Nice.

1082
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,700
Bunch of phonies.

1083
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:07,960
Oh I almost missed it again.

1084
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:17,600
What if it affected the real world and they are like just dealing with never ending like...

1085
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,480
The electricity is just completely haywired and...

1086
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,360
Everything is bad.

1087
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,400
Everything is destroyed.

1088
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,100
Oh!

1089
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:37,980
Secret passage.

1090
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,400
Dream diary made.

1091
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:44,840
Monday May 2nd.

1092
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:45,860
Started in the bathroom.

1093
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,860
Was walking towards the door but couldn't reach it.

1094
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,300
Voices on the other side of the door.

1095
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,380
They were saying something like a nursery rhyme.

1096
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,980
Intense feeling of deja vu.

1097
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:57,820
Tuesday.

1098
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,160
Floated through space for what felt like 7 hours.

1099
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,280
This sounds nice.

1100
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,120
Plenty of stars and no planets in sight.

1101
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:06,940
Wednesday.

1102
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,000
Stared...

1103
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,240
Wait.

1104
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,500
Started on the sofa in my living room.

1105
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:12,160
Couldn't move.

1106
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,080
Your sleep paralysis team?

1107
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:16,680
Thursday.

1108
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,240
Began with falling off a huge cliff.

1109
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:20,500
Right before landing.

1110
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,580
Fell back up to the top of the cliff.

1111
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,420
Repeated this many times.

1112
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,160
Realized I had...

1113
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:29,860
20...

1114
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:30,080
No.

1115
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,400
No hands.

1116
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,040
Wandering through a seemingly endless forest.

1117
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,000
Wolves howling in the distance.

1118
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:40,880
Oh, that was Friday.

1119
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,240
Weekend.

1120
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,020
Took the weekend off so as usual, no dreams.

1121
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,860
What do you mean no dreams?

1122
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,760
Oh yeah, there are two Wednesdays.

1123
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,120
You're right.

1124
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:53,760
Monday.

1125
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,840
Was eating cereal for breakfast.

1126
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,540
Kept eating the cereal but it kept refilling.

1127
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:01,020
Cereal everywhere after a while.

1128
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:02,640
Tuesday.

1129
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,100
Arguing with my best friend in high school.

1130
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:10,960
We were in a bank.

1131
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,180
I think we were getting a loan or something.

1132
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,800
Sounds too real?

1133
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,040
Too realistic.

1134
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,240
Are we in 1991?

1135
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,320
2?

1136
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,460
Oh my gosh, it's the How to Start It!

1137
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,400
Maybe just use Butler?

1138
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,820
But one to appear personable.

1139
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:40,080
Hi, I'm Dr. Pierce and you just started your Somniscope therapy session.

1140
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:41,560
Hey, Glenn here.

1141
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:44,040
Welcome to your first ever Somnisculture.

1142
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:45,980
Welcome to the future.

1143
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:50,160
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce and I cannot wait to show you what we've been working on.

1144
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:51,200
Greetings, traveler.

1145
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,700
Welcome to the wonderful world of Somniscope.

1146
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:57,400
I am Glenn Pierce and will be your guide on this journey.

1147
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,540
Good afternoon and welcome to Somniscope.

1148
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,180
My name is Dr. Glenn Pierce and I'm looking forward to helping you.

1149
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,940
Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

1150
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,220
Welcome to Somniscope.

1151
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,740
Open your eyes.

1152
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:08,100
Welcome to Somniscope.

1153
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:10,260
Welcome to the future of medical treatment.

1154
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,720
My name is Dr. Pierce and I invested... invented Somniscope.

1155
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,800
Given time, we can and will solve everything.

1156
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,840
What do you think this guy's name is?

1157
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:27,500
Was he... he's getting relaxium gas?

1158
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,300
This guy's full of gas.

1159
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:32,100
Facts.

1160
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,980
What am I made of?

1161
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:33,280
Money?

1162
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:35,440
Yes, don't tell anyone about this.

1163
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,220
Steve.

1164
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,650
I am Steve.

1165
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,320
Uncle Julio's rice pudding.

1166
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:46,220
Nice.

1167
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,280
Plywood sheets.

1168
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,140
Anti-vib pads.

1169
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:51,580
What's that?

1170
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,480
Fire extinguisher.

1171
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,360
That's a hefty bill.

1172
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,500
We can move on.

1173
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:03,600
I

1174
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:10,020
think this is just gonna be a loop.

1175
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:33,770
Maybe if I... wait.

1176
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:36,370
Grab clothes.

1177
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:40,670
And place far.

1178
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,780
I wish I could place it further.

1179
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:48,360
Okay, well.

1180
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:49,920
We have this.

1181
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,240
And this.

1182
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:56,500
What's over here?

1183
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:59,440
My game just saved.

1184
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,200
It scares me when it saves.

1185
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,500
It scares me.

1186
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,320
I don't like it.

1187
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:13,930
Oh.

1188
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:17,890
Oh, there it is.

1189
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:18,390
There it is.

1190
01:31:19,090 --> 01:31:20,430
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1191
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:23,330
Nice, nice.

1192
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:24,810
That's plenty big, no?

1193
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:28,370
You don't want it to save?

1194
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:30,390
I think something bad is gonna happen.

1195
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:33,390
Everyone knows in a horror game when it saves...

1196
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:39,810
Something bad's about to happen.

1197
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,260
What is it?

1198
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:46,840
We can just move it.

1199
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,740
Come on, peace.

1200
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:08,860
Oh, okay.

1201
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:10,220
Thank you.

1202
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:16,740
Hearing so many people skip their workout motivated me to do mine.

1203
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:18,600
Thank you, Minto.

1204
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:19,480
Thank you, Wisps.

1205
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:20,960
You're welcome.

1206
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:23,860
Okay, for me though, it was like...

1207
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,860
It was like... Not that I didn't want to do it, I just...

1208
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:33,640
I took a nap, okay?

1209
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,680
I took a nap.

1210
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:48,170
Oh, I don't think I can bring anything through here.

1211
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:50,510
Nope.

1212
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:56,210
Wait, they looked all messed up through here?

1213
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:58,550
But they're actually messed up.

1214
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,060
Relatable.

1215
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,540
You thought they were messed up from afar, but in reality...

1216
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:21,160
They're messed up.

1217
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,360
They're messed up!

1218
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,740
But this one actually got me.

1219
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:29,060
I thought these were real dice.

1220
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:31,700
Oh my gosh, this one actually got me.

1221
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:41,640
I guess

1222
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:49,680
they're really good about fire.

1223
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,120
They're very cautious.

1224
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,920
What the...

1225
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:55,780
What is this?

1226
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:04,480
Okay.

1227
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,240
Can I move the...

1228
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:15,740
This game is a workout of the mind.

1229
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:18,800
Truly.

1230
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:20,240
Oh, there's one over there too.

1231
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:22,740
Is there anything else we can move?

1232
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:26,280
What's the end goal?

1233
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:33,140
Psychos, welcome to the membership.

1234
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:33,740
Thank you.

1235
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,100
And Geru, welcome to the membership.

1236
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,240
Thank you.

1237
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,300
It's got a nice sound.

1238
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:50,820
The side of the dice.

1239
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,080
What do you mean the side of the dice?

1240
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:22,710
I can't adjust it while I'm on it.

1241
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:24,370
Mitsu blind?

1242
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:24,970
What do you mean?

1243
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:28,610
What do you mean I'm blind?

1244
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:30,510
What am I missing?

1245
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,040
How am I blind?

1246
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,820
How am I blind?

1247
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:53,370
Oh shoot.

1248
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:03,350
It says side of the dice, but I don't know what you mean by that.

1249
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:08,590
I think they want you to grab the gold pawn, but I don't know if you can.

1250
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,710
Yeah, you can't grab that.

1251
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:14,700
Or this.

1252
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:22,020
Or...oh there is not one for this one.

1253
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,740
Bike sack!

1254
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:27,220
Thank you so much for the...thank you!

1255
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,680
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1256
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:32,020
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1257
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:47,050
She lacks depth perception.

1258
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:48,290
I already know this.

1259
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:58,870
What way haven't you moved the columns?

1260
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:02,590
I don't know.

1261
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,600
There is a thingy there.

1262
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,900
Wait, maybe I can get it?

1263
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,940
No, no, no.

1264
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:20,020
Dang it.

1265
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:20,860
You see it?

1266
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,420
You see it?

1267
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,620
Eat the apple.

1268
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:35,260
I don't know!

1269
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:36,120
Can I get a hint?

1270
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:38,980
She lacks critical information.

1271
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,240
Clearly!

1272
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:43,220
I don't know.

1273
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,020
Can I get a hint?

1274
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:22,520
This one is actually stumping me.

1275
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,960
This one is actually stumping me.

1276
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,420
I'm trying to get up there.

1277
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,960
I know that I can do this.

1278
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:49,850
But I want to get up there.

1279
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:08,880
You guys!

1280
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:15,540
I said that there was a thing up there I wanted to try and get.

1281
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:38,970
I wonder if I just have to be kind of...precision...you know.

1282
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:44,650
Ah!

1283
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:51,540
Oh no!

1284
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:52,580
I ruined it!

1285
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:02,980
Stack the die.

1286
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:09,610
Maybe like this.

1287
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:10,870
No!

1288
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:16,850
I don't know.

1289
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:18,570
Can you move it while you jump?

1290
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:22,550
No, it doesn't seem like it.

1291
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:33,260
I just didn't do it at the right angle.

1292
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:38,580
Mission accomplished.

1293
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:12,340
Oh!

1294
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:17,100
Is he going to kill me?

1295
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,360
Oh god!

1296
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:30,800
He's huge!

1297
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:30,980
He's huge!

1298
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:41,420
I feel like there's got to be something around here with this duck.

1299
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,060
I feel like there's got to be something around here with this duck.

1300
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:48,240
There we go.

1301
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:49,540
I'm on him.

1302
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,960
I've taken down the duck.

1303
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:59,480
His name is Rick?

1304
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:00,720
Nah.

1305
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,920
His name is Ducky.

1306
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,550
Oh my god!

1307
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:12,330
I'm sorry!

1308
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:14,490
It's like Eeyore's house.

1309
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:16,910
Sorry.

1310
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:36,250
I heard something...

1311
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,540
I just wanted to look over here and now I ruined it.

1312
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:43,560
Oh my god.

1313
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:44,120
No!

1314
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:44,340
No!

1315
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,220
I have to do it the silly way.

1316
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,300
Or I get all close.

1317
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,260
That should be good, right?

1318
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:00,920
There we go.

1319
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:01,440
Nice.

1320
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,040
Private.

1321
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,860
Someone is going to the bathroom in there.

1322
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:13,080
What happens if I touch this one?

1323
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,960
Everything I love to touch dies!

1324
01:43:22,050 --> 01:43:23,090
Oopsie.

1325
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:36,400
Oopsie.

1326
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:41,140
Emotions slash expectations.

1327
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,040
Highly affect dreams.

1328
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:45,880
You are here.

1329
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:50,380
Jonas Dawson, Arthur Willis, Jojo Smith.

1330
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:52,820
Dream layers of the mind.

1331
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:56,020
People only dream of ordinary objects.

1332
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:56,680
Boring!

1333
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,100
There is this one.

1334
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:03,300
Oh what happened to Bart?

1335
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:12,470
Let's do casino.

1336
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:19,370
Jojo!

1337
01:44:22,830 --> 01:44:25,210
How long is this game anyway?

1338
01:44:27,730 --> 01:44:29,110
It's 5am.

1339
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:38,530
30 hours.

1340
01:44:39,370 --> 01:44:40,670
Few hours.

1341
01:44:41,890 --> 01:44:43,210
A little hours.

1342
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:44,330
Some hours.

1343
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:47,050
Oh they are brown now.

1344
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:00,050
Waterfall, right?

1345
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:12,310
Oh, we don't get an answer.

1346
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:14,670
I'm going to say yes.

1347
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:16,070
Please tell me doctor.

1348
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:19,250
What's wrong with my broke brain?

1349
01:45:24,810 --> 01:45:25,570
Doctor.

1350
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:27,430
Doctor help me.

1351
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:30,650
Guys, what if I were the doctor?

1352
01:45:32,350 --> 01:45:33,870
The doctor is in.

1353
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,780
There are so many...

1354
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:49,980
Oh I don't like that.

1355
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,300
Are you guys sure this isn't a horror game?

1356
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:58,840
See?

1357
01:45:59,000 --> 01:45:59,960
Red means scary!

1358
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:04,450
Are you guys sure?

1359
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,350
Are you guys sure this isn't a horror game?

1360
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:20,040
What's shining here?

1361
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:21,580
Oh they are like windows.

1362
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:22,740
Oh I see, I see.

1363
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,440
Emergency generator this way.

1364
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:31,880
You are a ghost?

1365
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:32,800
What are you scared of?

1366
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:37,320
Ghosts in video games are spooky!

1367
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:43,180
Suddenly a zombie apocalypse.

1368
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,400
No it was the exit!

1369
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,040
What if I go back?

1370
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:56,020
It's nothing.

1371
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:02,850
This game is spooky.

1372
01:47:03,470 --> 01:47:05,270
Way spookier than I thought.

1373
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:13,010
Let's see if I'm able to interact with anything.

1374
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:20,030
Oh my gosh!

1375
01:47:20,110 --> 01:47:20,970
Run girl!

1376
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:21,810
Thank you for the hug!

1377
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:23,970
Wait, did you cause this?

1378
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:33,620
Guys, there is a handprint.

1379
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,020
There are handprints!

1380
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:02,720
Big.

1381
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:05,900
I'm just going to keep going?

1382
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:19,090
No!

1383
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:20,630
What's today?

1384
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:21,450
What's today?

1385
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:23,930
No it's Thursday!

1386
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:25,650
No!

1387
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:40,130
I'm scared.

1388
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:45,010
Thank you for the five minutes.

1389
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:45,610
Thank you.

1390
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:47,630
I'm scared.

1391
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:49,630
I'm scared.

1392
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:50,170
I'm scared.

1393
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:50,730
I'm scared.

1394
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:51,410
I'm scared.

1395
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:53,010
I'm scared.

1396
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:53,510
I'm scared.

1397
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:54,030
I'm scared.

1398
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:54,690
I'm scared.

1399
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:54,770
I'm scared.

1400
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:01,060
Thank you for the gift.

1401
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,320
I should have saved this for Sunday.

1402
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,020
So true.

1403
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,500
Perception is reality, but I don't know what to perceive.

1404
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:29,450
Go into the dark?

1405
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:29,870
No!

1406
01:49:29,870 --> 01:49:29,950
No!

1407
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:34,990
Ghost is like an encompassing term like dog.

1408
01:49:35,130 --> 01:49:36,130
Mint is a Pomeranian.

1409
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:37,770
Other ghosts are like German Shepard.

1410
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:39,530
No, I'm really scary though.

1411
01:49:39,570 --> 01:49:40,250
I promise.

1412
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:46,440
Am I doing it?

1413
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:02,320
The lights in this room suck.

1414
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:05,820
I think they really need to...oh my gosh.

1415
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:06,520
Just die!

1416
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:07,000
Die!

1417
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:07,400
Die!

1418
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:07,780
Die!

1419
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:14,420
Guys, don't freak out.

1420
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,860
It's just diet soda.

1421
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:19,280
What were you freaking out for?

1422
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:31,180
Murder, murder, murder is still on the menu.

1423
01:50:34,930 --> 01:50:36,370
Who are we murdering boys?

1424
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:56,580
How far does this go?

1425
01:51:00,670 --> 01:51:01,950
I'm at the edge.

1426
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:07,130
Why is this part so scary?

1427
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:10,650
Super liminal.

1428
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:12,770
I did not sign up for this.

1429
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:15,310
Diet soda.

1430
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:16,450
What does it mean?

1431
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:39,680
Ok, not that way.

1432
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:40,660
I see.

1433
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:43,200
Did I go this way?

1434
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:46,940
Thank you murderer!

1435
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:55,010
Thank you murderer for lighting up the...thank you.

1436
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:59,710
He just wants to see my scared face even more.

1437
01:51:59,790 --> 01:52:00,530
What do you have to say now?

1438
01:52:00,530 --> 01:52:03,490
Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

1439
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:08,750
And I'd like to talk more about the feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt I mentioned before.

1440
01:52:09,630 --> 01:52:14,530
You feel this way because you want the kind of happy life you see all around you.

1441
01:52:14,990 --> 01:52:17,390
The kind you know everyone else is enjoying.

1442
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:20,790
And that's exactly why we're here to help.

1443
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:25,050
I think if I went to this place and I had a dream about...

1444
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:27,370
Something's going to pop up here.

1445
01:52:28,670 --> 01:52:29,490
Nevermind.

1446
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:33,950
If I had a dream about maybe potentially getting murdered.

1447
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:35,890
I think I might sue the place.

1448
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,660
It's a chess piece.

1449
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:49,880
I was going to say, that's a really short person.

1450
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:57,060
That's a teeny tiny guy right there.

1451
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:04,920
It's just paint, right guys?

1452
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:10,670
It's just paint, right guys?

1453
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:14,750
Don't turn around!

1454
01:53:39,930 --> 01:53:42,570
Wait, this way?

1455
01:53:43,410 --> 01:53:44,010
Wait, where?

1456
01:53:47,210 --> 01:53:48,330
This way.

1457
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:49,550
Thank you!

1458
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:03,070
Which way?

1459
01:54:05,070 --> 01:54:06,430
That looks pretty bad.

1460
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:11,470
Wall into darkness.

1461
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:14,110
Wait, I missed a stair?

1462
01:54:14,310 --> 01:54:14,890
There's a stair?

1463
01:54:18,610 --> 01:54:19,170
This way?

1464
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,380
I see, I see.

1465
01:54:29,650 --> 01:54:30,030
Alright.

1466
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:52,310
This is not me!

1467
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:55,510
I am new to your community.

1468
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:56,750
I've seen some clips here and there.

1469
01:54:56,810 --> 01:54:57,510
I want to enjoy it more.

1470
01:54:57,650 --> 01:54:58,070
I watch your streams.

1471
01:54:58,210 --> 01:54:59,910
I can't wait to see Spoopy and my toys.

1472
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:02,050
Thank you!

1473
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:03,770
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

1474
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:08,130
Welcome, you give me strength.

1475
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:09,630
I'm not scared.

1476
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:11,750
I'm just a little scared.

1477
01:55:14,730 --> 01:55:18,050
Wait, I'm scared!

1478
01:55:20,110 --> 01:55:21,470
I lied.

1479
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:24,330
I'm very much scared.

1480
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:29,650
I'm very much scared.

1481
01:55:29,650 --> 01:55:30,350
I'm scared.

1482
01:55:32,350 --> 01:55:36,970
How do I get... do we go up?

1483
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:38,870
Is there anywhere up?

1484
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:41,670
How do I get out of here?

1485
01:55:44,290 --> 01:55:45,930
What if I go back?

1486
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:48,170
Nothing, it seems.

1487
01:55:50,490 --> 01:55:52,290
I almost missed it.

1488
01:56:00,830 --> 01:56:03,630
Yeah, get Woolooloo'd!

1489
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:07,510
Oh

1490
01:56:15,310 --> 01:56:17,070
wait, hold on.

1491
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:18,610
My bad, my bad.

1492
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:20,830
Grab close.

1493
01:56:21,610 --> 01:56:22,690
And make big.

1494
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:24,230
Grab close.

1495
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:26,470
And make big.

1496
01:56:27,050 --> 01:56:28,410
Grab close.

1497
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:31,230
Big.

1498
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:34,830
Make big.

1499
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:41,740
Guys?

1500
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:45,400
Guys?

1501
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,040
It returned!

1502
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:06,680
Oh my gosh, they thought of everything.

1503
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:11,180
What am I supposed to do here with the light?

1504
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,740
I didn't see anything that seemed like... you know.

1505
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:30,140
Wow, that really lights up the room.

1506
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:32,240
Nice.

1507
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:33,660
OK, now we can see.

1508
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:36,980
But I can't see what to do.

1509
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:38,540
Is

1510
01:57:47,690 --> 01:57:49,370
that the right idea?

1511
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:51,630
I didn't know what I was doing though.

1512
01:57:59,230 --> 01:57:59,830
Fit.

1513
01:58:00,730 --> 01:58:01,030
No?

1514
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,580
This room?

1515
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:16,740
You can't remove the planks.

1516
01:58:16,740 --> 01:58:18,500
Oh my god!

1517
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:28,990
Can I take you back please?

1518
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:31,690
Please ma'am.

1519
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:36,370
Let me take you back.

1520
01:58:37,170 --> 01:58:39,610
I made a mistake, please.

1521
01:58:40,090 --> 01:58:44,110
We are in the Ryan Shipping... what is this?

1522
01:58:44,990 --> 01:58:46,150
Ry-san, my bad.

1523
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:54,540
I can't see anything, but we are just going for it.

1524
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:57,680
If I can't see anything, nothing is scary.

1525
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:58,660
Maybe.

1526
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:04,980
We made it!

1527
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:16,490
Only one?

1528
01:59:17,490 --> 01:59:18,490
So cheap.

1529
01:59:19,530 --> 01:59:21,350
Emergency generator this way.

1530
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:21,770
OK.

1531
01:59:23,190 --> 01:59:24,150
I'll follow you.

1532
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:28,050
We are not out yet.

1533
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:29,770
No, please.

1534
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,910
It's too spooky.

1535
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,040
It's so spooky.

1536
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:42,920
Good job, Minto.

1537
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:43,840
Thanks.

1538
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:48,000
Oh, I thought that went through for a second.

1539
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:58,540
We definitely need to find... maybe it lights up.

1540
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:00,640
Like that.

1541
02:00:04,900 --> 02:00:07,380
Diet soda, diet soda, diet soda.

1542
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:10,120
Gosh, I really like diet soda.

1543
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:12,940
Oh no.

1544
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:23,440
There we go.

1545
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:25,140
Make it real big.

1546
02:00:25,740 --> 02:00:26,660
Make her big.

1547
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:29,980
Ready!

1548
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:31,360
Holy cow!

1549
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:38,500
Guys, we are in the actual tanning bed right now.

1550
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:45,760
Oh I see it!

1551
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:46,240
I see it!

1552
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:51,100
I found it.

1553
02:01:01,700 --> 02:01:07,580
99% of patients who are able to follow simple instructions from the standard orientation protocol.

1554
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:17,130
The murderer was right there!

1555
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:23,600
The murderer was right there!

1556
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:27,220
Where did the knife go?

1557
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:29,040
The murderer took it, obviously.

1558
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:36,750
Oh golly, oh golly, oh golly, oh golly...

1559
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:37,790
Ikea?

1560
02:01:39,610 --> 02:01:40,610
Idea!

1561
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,740
Everything is fixed.

1562
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:03,320
Oh we have the regular music back!

1563
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:09,340
It was the red paint!

1564
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:13,840
And stacks of it.

1565
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:19,360
I need to go out that window.

1566
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:27,140
Opposite your name right?

1567
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:27,980
Thank you!

1568
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:29,320
Thank you so much for the 20 gifts.

1569
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:30,780
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1570
02:02:35,570 --> 02:02:37,110
We made it, you guys.

1571
02:02:37,190 --> 02:02:37,870
We made it.

1572
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:43,030
Why did he drag the paint all through here?

1573
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:47,330
What a silly goose that guy is.

1574
02:02:51,810 --> 02:02:52,290
Ugh.

1575
02:02:56,870 --> 02:02:58,610
The jokes are real.

1576
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:03,090
Can I go up here?

1577
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:13,060
Fascinating.

1578
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:18,220
Is there anything I can interact with in here?

1579
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,080
Oh I guess all the windows are open, nevermind.

1580
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:23,140
I thought only that one was.

1581
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:24,520
Here we go!

1582
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:28,440
Eggshell.

1583
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:29,280
Oh that's the color!

1584
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:31,640
There's a blueprint in the kitchen?

1585
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:32,400
Oh thank you.

1586
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:35,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1587
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:40,280
Can we softlock ourselves?

1588
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:43,740
Oh!

1589
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,800
The beans!

1590
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,660
The beans!

1591
02:03:58,440 --> 02:04:00,120
Wait, I don't see it though.

1592
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:04,050
Oops.

1593
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:04,430
No.

1594
02:04:04,810 --> 02:04:05,970
OK, we got it.

1595
02:04:06,270 --> 02:04:10,800
I don't see the blueprint.

1596
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:13,820
It's Sunday already?

1597
02:04:16,060 --> 02:04:19,780
Gosh, these days just get shorter and shorter.

1598
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:28,740
And then what about the other days?

1599
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:30,120
Backer room.

1600
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:35,080
Blueprint, blueprint, blueprint, blueprint.

1601
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,600
Looking for mega blue.

1602
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:40,100
Looking for the bluest...

1603
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:44,580
Oh wait, I think if I use the beans we can hop over this, no?

1604
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:48,040
Not the beans!

1605
02:04:48,580 --> 02:04:49,420
Come here bean.

1606
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:54,100
It's not Sunday.

1607
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:11,250
What is it?

1608
02:05:14,270 --> 02:05:15,370
Dream architect.

1609
02:05:19,420 --> 02:05:20,700
Anything else in here?

1610
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:27,440
Wait a second.

1611
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:32,080
Wait.

1612
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:35,700
Oh wait.

1613
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,640
Are there any more beans?

1614
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:42,760
Gosh.

1615
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:44,880
Dama!

1616
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:46,380
Thank you so much for the raid.

1617
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:47,280
Thank you!

1618
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:48,800
Hello, hello.

1619
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:51,780
Where did I put my beans here?

1620
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:53,760
Oh, I can't grab them.

1621
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:55,120
Guys?

1622
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:12,280
No way.

1623
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:15,520
No way.

1624
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:17,780
Why are you going to let me grab them?

1625
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,480
Guys, I think I've...

1626
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:23,360
I think...

1627
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,340
I think we've beaten ourselves.

1628
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:28,460
No!

1629
02:06:29,740 --> 02:06:31,040
Remaking to the gifted!

1630
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:34,620
Jump on the dolly?

1631
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:35,600
This one over here?

1632
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,020
Who said that?

1633
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:44,160
Who said jump on the dolly?

1634
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:45,200
Gaspar!

1635
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:49,160
You saved the stream.

1636
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,740
Is there anything on this side?

1637
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,040
I won't make the same mistake again.

1638
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:06,760
Doesn't seem like it.

1639
02:07:17,290 --> 02:07:18,090
How

1640
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,400
much is in these beans?

1641
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:26,240
Serving size 5 wads.

1642
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:31,540
1200 calories per serving?

1643
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:34,220
How much is a wad?

1644
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:36,380
Like a big old...

1645
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:37,600
Like that?

1646
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,400
Like you just scoop it up and...you know?

1647
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:48,400
I might be making a mistake, but...

1648
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:52,620
This is how adventures happen.

1649
02:07:54,120 --> 02:07:55,680
Eat one and you're done.

1650
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,840
Yeah, you're basically done for the whole day.

1651
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:00,620
Ok, can I...

1652
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:02,100
do this?

1653
02:08:03,940 --> 02:08:05,980
Oh I made it, but it's nothing!

1654
02:08:09,870 --> 02:08:10,470
No!

1655
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:13,050
No adventures for us you guys.

1656
02:08:13,950 --> 02:08:15,930
No adventures for us.

1657
02:08:19,070 --> 02:08:20,270
Second breakfast.

1658
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:22,350
Oh the cloud insert.

1659
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:23,490
That's probably what we were looking at.

1660
02:08:23,550 --> 02:08:24,350
Banana yellow.

1661
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:26,690
Order more red paint.

1662
02:08:27,390 --> 02:08:28,930
Yeah, because someone wasted it all.

1663
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:36,380
Good job team.

1664
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:37,220
Other window.

1665
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:37,880
Avocado?

1666
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:40,260
Need to sleep.

1667
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:45,960
Promotes heart health, anti-cancer, blood sugar regulation, potassium, anti-inflammatory.

1668
02:08:46,100 --> 02:08:46,420
Why?

1669
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:47,440
Too many?

1670
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:48,260
How many really?

1671
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:50,860
I hate avocado.

1672
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:53,860
Self-doubt worthlessness.

1673
02:08:59,910 --> 02:09:01,770
I don't like avocado.

1674
02:09:04,450 --> 02:09:05,450
You do?

1675
02:09:05,630 --> 02:09:07,010
Yeah, I don't like it.

1676
02:09:07,010 --> 02:09:11,490
Even as a guacamole, I don't eat guacamole because I don't like avocado.

1677
02:09:14,850 --> 02:09:19,010
Maybe send me a good avocado recipe and I'll try it.

1678
02:09:20,810 --> 02:09:21,330
What?

1679
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:22,230
You're literally green?

1680
02:09:22,350 --> 02:09:25,030
Oh do you like everything your color too?

1681
02:09:26,070 --> 02:09:27,370
What are you... What Raymak?

1682
02:09:27,490 --> 02:09:27,750
What?

1683
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:33,930
You also grow or shrink based on perspective.

1684
02:09:33,930 --> 02:09:36,070
Apparently in fan art.

1685
02:09:37,450 --> 02:09:38,530
Flesh colored?

1686
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:40,830
You love everything flesh colored?

1687
02:09:44,750 --> 02:09:46,610
Avocado is like a bland potato.

1688
02:09:47,210 --> 02:09:48,910
I just don't like it.

1689
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:52,370
I'll eat it if I... Oh I thought it said evil.

1690
02:09:54,790 --> 02:09:55,410
Uh-oh.

1691
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:03,550
They're really trying to get us up, huh?

1692
02:10:03,770 --> 02:10:04,850
We're on an adventure.

1693
02:10:07,850 --> 02:10:12,230
Nick, tell me if you guys send me... Oh gosh, I thought that was a face for a second.

1694
02:10:12,610 --> 02:10:16,890
If you guys can send me a good avocado recipe on Twitter, I'll make it.

1695
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:18,550
I'll try it for real.

1696
02:10:26,250 --> 02:10:27,490
No message?

1697
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:32,490
I like the music in this game.

1698
02:10:33,130 --> 02:10:33,650
A lot.

1699
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:37,810
Oh we're back to basics!

1700
02:10:39,450 --> 02:10:40,250
Oh.

1701
02:10:41,150 --> 02:10:44,290
Well that's just... a stinkin' shame.

1702
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:48,970
Why

1703
02:10:54,280 --> 02:10:55,880
would they do this?

1704
02:10:59,410 --> 02:11:00,790
Anything out here?

1705
02:11:07,330 --> 02:11:08,190
This bucket?

1706
02:11:08,370 --> 02:11:08,570
No.

1707
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:09,950
Here?

1708
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:10,290
No.

1709
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:13,490
Gamers, don't look up.

1710
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:23,820
The door, but I would have to... Oh, this one.

1711
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:27,180
Sorry, I thought I used it all the way over there.

1712
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:34,700
They're both even green!

1713
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:36,820
Just like me and avocados.

1714
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:38,500
10 months of best ghost.

1715
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:39,460
Thank you!

1716
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:41,540
Sidewinder0, thank you.

1717
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:42,740
Oi!

1718
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:21,020
Wait, I gotta time it.

1719
02:12:23,940 --> 02:12:25,240
I'm just a little bit off.

1720
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:29,980
This one sounds like your theme song.

1721
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:36,400
Which one did you want?

1722
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:41,420
What are we feeling?

1723
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:56,440
How many are there?

1724
02:12:58,740 --> 02:13:00,820
It's a very smooth jazz.

1725
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:04,720
A very smooth jazz.

1726
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:10,660
Lo-fi.

1727
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:18,660
One issue with too many lo-fi tracks is that the percussion always hits too hard.

1728
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:22,800
What do you guys think?

1729
02:13:22,980 --> 02:13:25,260
Does it hit too hard for you?

1730
02:13:31,270 --> 02:13:32,710
It's just how it is.

1731
02:13:35,370 --> 02:13:36,830
It's such a lo-fi thing.

1732
02:13:37,150 --> 02:13:40,730
It's the only thing that makes me not able to vibe so much with it.

1733
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:42,150
Because I'm always just hearing the click.

1734
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:48,770
First one with the saxophone was good.

1735
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:50,630
I agree.

1736
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,380
Wait, where's the saxophone?

1737
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:00,870
Two?

1738
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:02,910
Ah, this one.

1739
02:14:07,190 --> 02:14:09,630
This sounds like a Pokemon city.

1740
02:14:28,110 --> 02:14:35,490
Oh, it just keeps...

1741
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:40,940
Collision physics.

1742
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:45,760
Wait, can I turn on my auto clicker real quick?

1743
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:48,020
Hold on, I'm gonna...

1744
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:50,040
Auto... wait, hold on.

1745
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:52,000
Auto...

1746
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,580
Wait, click...

1747
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:54,100
No!

1748
02:14:54,760 --> 02:14:58,040
I didn't download it again on my new computer!

1749
02:15:01,570 --> 02:15:02,470
Wait, hold on.

1750
02:15:02,490 --> 02:15:03,410
I'm gonna download it.

1751
02:15:03,670 --> 02:15:05,570
Was it on this... where did I get it from?

1752
02:15:08,150 --> 02:15:08,910
Hold on.

1753
02:15:09,710 --> 02:15:10,930
Maybe it was this one.

1754
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:13,530
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1755
02:15:13,790 --> 02:15:14,250
Install?

1756
02:15:14,590 --> 02:15:15,210
Okay, hold on.

1757
02:15:17,590 --> 02:15:20,990
Yeah, I got a new computer a little while ago.

1758
02:15:21,790 --> 02:15:23,890
Okay, auto... wait, no, no, no.

1759
02:15:25,070 --> 02:15:27,330
Auto... auto... clicker.

1760
02:15:27,650 --> 02:15:29,590
Wait, click...

1761
02:15:29,590 --> 02:15:32,950
Why isn't it loading?

1762
02:15:34,990 --> 02:15:35,410
Hello?

1763
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:37,610
Hello?

1764
02:15:37,610 --> 02:15:38,410
Installed.

1765
02:15:40,130 --> 02:15:40,930
Hello?

1766
02:15:41,870 --> 02:15:42,670
Hello?

1767
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:50,740
Oh, I got it.

1768
02:15:54,330 --> 02:15:57,490
One millisecond and then we'll do hotkey.

1769
02:15:58,410 --> 02:15:59,750
Oh no, we can just do this one.

1770
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:01,730
You guys ready?

1771
02:16:08,530 --> 02:16:10,390
It's not as many as I thought it would be.

1772
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:24,560
There's a limit?

1773
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:27,080
No, there's not.

1774
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:39,800
Come on game, let me play.

1775
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:41,600
Let me play the game.

1776
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:42,900
Let me play the game.

1777
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:48,960
It literally won't let me do it anymore.

1778
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:54,660
Come on game.

1779
02:16:54,820 --> 02:16:55,800
Come on game.

1780
02:17:18,090 --> 02:17:19,950
Don't... there's not even that many.

1781
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:27,010
Oh, what do we do here now?

1782
02:17:27,390 --> 02:17:28,630
Okay, so this is a puzzle.

1783
02:17:32,370 --> 02:17:36,210
Here I thought we were just having a good time.

1784
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:38,390
I did see, though, over here.

1785
02:17:39,710 --> 02:17:41,410
This is just like yesterday's Lemurs.

1786
02:17:59,700 --> 02:18:00,960
Stairway to heaven, baby.

1787
02:18:07,930 --> 02:18:08,450
Baby?

1788
02:18:08,970 --> 02:18:09,130
Oh.

1789
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:27,360
This requires you to note the following risks of dream overexposure.

1790
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:31,160
Significant memory loss, both quantitative and qualitative.

1791
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:34,240
Hallucinations of dreaded or annoying objects.

1792
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:37,400
Unrealistic beliefs about the lengths of hallways.

1793
02:18:37,880 --> 02:18:42,120
And other side effects which have not yet been discovered or which cannot be understood.

1794
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:43,680
Okay.

1795
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:48,180
I'm sorry, I was getting rid of my auto clicker because it remained on the screen.

1796
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:48,620
Okay.

1797
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:49,400
Resume.

1798
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:49,860
Okay.

1799
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:06,330
Right click to return.

1800
02:19:09,350 --> 02:19:11,390
Okay, but also shut up, please.

1801
02:19:12,030 --> 02:19:12,970
No, please shut up.

1802
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:14,810
No, god, please.

1803
02:19:19,250 --> 02:19:20,310
No, please!

1804
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:32,060
Oh, thank goodness.

1805
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:34,940
I was just going to keep making more until it stopped.

1806
02:19:37,020 --> 02:19:38,020
Let me out!

1807
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:38,860
This hell.

1808
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:45,040
Oh, I thought they were eyeballs for a second.

1809
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:47,640
It's morning already.

1810
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:50,540
Perception is reality.

1811
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:56,400
You think if you stared at this for long enough and then you blink your eyes, you see baby Jesus?

1812
02:20:01,770 --> 02:20:02,810
Oh, purple.

1813
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:07,460
No!

1814
02:20:16,740 --> 02:20:18,180
Right click to return.

1815
02:20:18,900 --> 02:20:23,790
What if I just push it?

1816
02:20:25,730 --> 02:20:26,710
She didn't notice it.

1817
02:20:26,850 --> 02:20:27,390
Notice what?

1818
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:31,430
What didn't I notice?

1819
02:20:32,590 --> 02:20:34,130
No, full grown Jesus.

1820
02:20:44,730 --> 02:20:47,050
What didn't I notice?

1821
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:07,590
My crosshair changed.

1822
02:21:07,710 --> 02:21:08,070
Where?

1823
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:26,780
Wait, what if we just fill the room with apples?

1824
02:21:36,110 --> 02:21:36,590
So

1825
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:49,520
many apples!

1826
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:52,280
Oh god, you guys.

1827
02:21:52,480 --> 02:21:53,160
Oh god, you guys.

1828
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,540
You guys, there are too many apples!

1829
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:57,340
There are too many apples!

1830
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:07,760
It won't let me make anymore apples.

1831
02:22:15,220 --> 02:22:16,420
I opened it?

1832
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:18,140
No I didn't.

1833
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:28,640
I

1834
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:35,670
knocked the sign over.

1835
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:42,700
But if I keep making more I'm just pushing it off so it's actually kind of working.

1836
02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:46,820
Push!

1837
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:48,060
Push!

1838
02:22:48,870 --> 02:22:49,280
Yeah!

1839
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:53,820
I did it.

1840
02:22:57,750 --> 02:22:58,810
What's two?

1841
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:09,320
Wow.

1842
02:23:09,820 --> 02:23:11,280
Oh, sorry.

1843
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:15,420
Big ol' fan.

1844
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:16,740
Boy is this going to blow me.

1845
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:23,680
Wow, didn't even blow me away even a little bit.

1846
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:29,220
Nothing can impress me I've seen it all.

1847
02:23:32,990 --> 02:23:34,650
Huge fan by the way.

1848
02:23:35,930 --> 02:23:37,050
What about these papers?

1849
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:44,270
Wouldn't it be so bad if the fan breached them and made a huge mess for whoever has to clean that up.

1850
02:23:46,590 --> 02:23:48,870
I wish you luck, Minto, on this area.

1851
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:50,250
Wait, why?

1852
02:23:50,510 --> 02:23:51,330
I'm scared now.

1853
02:23:51,990 --> 02:23:52,930
Fake fan!

1854
02:23:52,930 --> 02:23:54,310
Could be.

1855
02:24:10,200 --> 02:24:13,640
Wait, who changed the music?

1856
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:22,200
Who changed the music?

1857
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:38,460
My last strat worked so why wouldn't this one?

1858
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:56,080
What is crashing over there?

1859
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:57,180
Oh my god!

1860
02:24:57,500 --> 02:24:58,300
Oh my god!

1861
02:25:10,310 --> 02:25:11,510
Holy cow!

1862
02:25:12,370 --> 02:25:13,190
Ok, hold on.

1863
02:25:14,170 --> 02:25:14,790
No, no, no!

1864
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:16,350
Oh no!

1865
02:25:16,990 --> 02:25:18,350
Please giant apple!

1866
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:19,210
Please!

1867
02:25:23,230 --> 02:25:24,510
You can do it!

1868
02:25:26,390 --> 02:25:27,710
You can do it!

1869
02:25:27,810 --> 02:25:28,990
You can do it!

1870
02:25:29,690 --> 02:25:31,030
You can do it!

1871
02:25:32,350 --> 02:25:35,410
Once I push this though...

1872
02:25:35,410 --> 02:25:39,570
Oh, it's going to send it shooting everywhere.

1873
02:25:40,450 --> 02:25:42,050
Why are you rolling on your own?

1874
02:25:43,450 --> 02:25:45,450
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1875
02:25:47,930 --> 02:25:49,830
I'm pushing it with the apples.

1876
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:56,070
So we're going to basically spam it through the fan with the apples.

1877
02:25:56,350 --> 02:25:58,590
You understand?

1878
02:25:58,770 --> 02:25:59,090
You understand?

1879
02:26:14,290 --> 02:26:16,310
Oh, let me make anymore.

1880
02:26:16,630 --> 02:26:19,710
Oh, now they're... You guys, they turned into peaches.

1881
02:26:21,310 --> 02:26:22,150
I don't know what's happening.

1882
02:26:22,730 --> 02:26:23,590
Why are they pink?

1883
02:26:27,250 --> 02:26:28,910
Nah, you can't pick it up.

1884
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:51,550
Do I have to block this and then fill the room with apples?

1885
02:26:53,710 --> 02:26:56,910
Great job recreating the Sisyphus tree.

1886
02:26:58,570 --> 02:27:00,930
Why is this one so spinny?

1887
02:27:01,330 --> 02:27:03,750
It has it's own little mind.

1888
02:27:04,990 --> 02:27:06,790
Come on, get in there.

1889
02:27:07,950 --> 02:27:08,690
Get in there.

1890
02:27:08,690 --> 02:27:08,930
Oh!

1891
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:26,110
Why are my apples radioactive?

1892
02:27:30,090 --> 02:27:31,370
Radioactive, radioactive.

1893
02:27:34,090 --> 02:27:35,490
Falling in is okay.

1894
02:27:35,770 --> 02:27:37,090
Okay, let's see where it leads then.

1895
02:27:48,370 --> 02:27:49,510
Oh, okay.

1896
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:55,520
But my apples don't return.

1897
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:00,040
Is there one up here maybe?

1898
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:00,520
I think.

1899
02:28:11,380 --> 02:28:16,260
What if I... I was going to say what if I pick up enough of these, but you can't pick up anything.

1900
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:28,800
Can I just turn you off?

1901
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:34,860
I know how to turn you off.

1902
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,960
Hi, I'm Mimphanto.

1903
02:28:39,060 --> 02:28:40,780
Welcome to my stream.

1904
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:42,600
Hello.

1905
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,660
Today I'm going to be doing food ASMR.

1906
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:54,020
Where I'm going to munch and cringe really loudly.

1907
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:01,900
Radioactive.

1908
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:05,940
I pressed right click.

1909
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:07,460
No!

1910
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:08,940
My giant apple!

1911
02:29:18,460 --> 02:29:21,240
I'd say a nice try, but bad try.

1912
02:29:22,180 --> 02:29:23,800
How did I make the big apple?

1913
02:29:25,380 --> 02:29:27,680
New York!

1914
02:29:31,820 --> 02:29:33,220
Everything

1915
02:29:44,760 --> 02:29:46,980
is perspective.

1916
02:29:49,140 --> 02:29:50,660
Wait a second.

1917
02:30:17,820 --> 02:30:19,220
Hello.

1918
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:41,640
Huh?

1919
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:42,920
Nicely done.

1920
02:30:42,980 --> 02:30:43,600
Thank you.

1921
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:49,540
Oh, this is still happening.

1922
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:51,420
I was going to ask.

1923
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:55,860
If you guys don't mind, if you know this game.

1924
02:30:55,860 --> 02:30:59,780
If you don't mind giving a little bit of a warning before we get into like...

1925
02:30:59,780 --> 02:31:03,120
I know some people said there's like a lot of motion sickness stuff.

1926
02:31:03,820 --> 02:31:06,000
I don't know if that's like a certain part of the game.

1927
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:08,240
So if people don't...

1928
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:10,960
If people could give a warning in the chat like...

1929
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:13,860
Hey, we're about to enter the sicky zone.

1930
02:31:19,620 --> 02:31:21,240
Doc feels good now.

1931
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:25,600
After a few discreet eliminations, I would like to resend my statement from before.

1932
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:27,740
You are now the best mate.

1933
02:31:27,860 --> 02:31:28,700
What do you mean?

1934
02:31:31,440 --> 02:31:31,880
Gallery?

1935
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:37,380
I don't like this new addition about this.

1936
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,020
I want to still be able to pick stuff up.

1937
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:42,740
Thinking with portals.

1938
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:43,840
I mean perspective.

1939
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:44,060
Perspective.

1940
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:54,300
Anything else in here?

1941
02:32:05,960 --> 02:32:08,300
You like the glasses?

1942
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:13,360
We're about to enter the motion sickness zone.

1943
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:16,740
Oh, we saw this one before.

1944
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:17,780
With the pirate.

1945
02:32:27,380 --> 02:32:28,740
Oh, there's Tiny.

1946
02:32:40,650 --> 02:32:44,040
I can make teeny tiny vending machines.

1947
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:49,460
Or big giant vending machines.

1948
02:32:51,610 --> 02:32:52,840
It's not even soda.

1949
02:32:54,340 --> 02:32:55,640
Oh, Tiny.

1950
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:57,080
Tiniest vending machine.

1951
02:32:58,160 --> 02:32:59,380
Oh, now I can pick them up?

1952
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:01,740
Okay.

1953
02:33:02,180 --> 02:33:02,640
Sure.

1954
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:03,640
Whatever.

1955
02:33:04,580 --> 02:33:05,040
Fine.

1956
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:11,050
Maybe this one will give us...

1957
02:33:11,050 --> 02:33:12,690
Give us soda.

1958
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:16,720
Unlimited.

1959
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:18,560
Unlimited soda.

1960
02:33:22,820 --> 02:33:24,320
It's so big.

1961
02:33:25,170 --> 02:33:25,840
Come on.

1962
02:33:26,620 --> 02:33:29,020
I'm hacking the system.

1963
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:36,940
I never have enough soda.

1964
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:38,860
I can't even have soda.

1965
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:41,640
I'm doing this for you guys.

1966
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:50,100
I'm basically an employee at this point.

1967
02:33:50,220 --> 02:33:55,220
You could say I'm like a stress tester, you know?

1968
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:56,940
I'm a beta tester.

1969
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:57,540
I'm a beater.

1970
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:02,680
Hello.

1971
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:05,160
Name is my peer, Dr. Glenn.

1972
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:11,300
To the Somnosculpt welcome experience, team of your care leader, patient years 10 development.

1973
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:13,840
Conditions struggle you whatever with?

1974
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:15,680
Professional invention.

1975
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:19,740
Edge science with cutting, a tomorrow can bright.

1976
02:34:20,480 --> 02:34:23,400
And buts, no ifs, or look good.

1977
02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:24,700
Thank you.

1978
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:29,520
I think things are a little screwy.

1979
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:32,920
What if I forget to set the alarm?

1980
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:35,840
Emergency exit protocol.

1981
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:38,680
Let's just kill yourself.

1982
02:34:39,020 --> 02:34:39,260
Oh wait.

1983
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:40,040
Wait, wait, wait.

1984
02:34:41,380 --> 02:34:42,020
Sorry.

1985
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:51,990
Dang it.

1986
02:34:55,070 --> 02:34:56,830
Door next to the vending machine.

1987
02:34:57,070 --> 02:34:57,670
Wait, what door?

1988
02:34:59,170 --> 02:34:59,790
There was?

1989
02:35:11,130 --> 02:35:11,770
Beater.

1990
02:35:23,870 --> 02:35:25,090
Thank you.

1991
02:35:25,310 --> 02:35:26,690
I missed it entirely.

1992
02:35:28,930 --> 02:35:31,190
Wow, it's purple in this one.

1993
02:35:32,130 --> 02:35:34,610
Alright, let's figure out what this bad boy is.

1994
02:35:35,790 --> 02:35:37,110
Thank you.

1995
02:35:37,630 --> 02:35:39,430
It's a...

1996
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:42,670
It's a vending machine!

1997
02:36:00,070 --> 02:36:01,050
They fall.

1998
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:02,370
The stars fall on us.

1999
02:36:07,850 --> 02:36:12,450
You ever just think about how we're just a tiny little speck in this whole universe?

2000
02:36:13,230 --> 02:36:16,370
How we're just stuck on this floating rock in space.

2001
02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:19,710
And how there's so many other floating rocks in space.

2002
02:36:19,850 --> 02:36:22,090
And how everything just feels so insignificant.

2003
02:36:22,530 --> 02:36:26,010
When you really just put it into perspective of how large space is.

2004
02:36:26,110 --> 02:36:28,410
And how much is going on in the universe.

2005
02:36:28,890 --> 02:36:31,370
And just that one little problem you have.

2006
02:36:31,370 --> 02:36:35,150
It's just like a little... not even an ant.

2007
02:36:35,250 --> 02:36:36,930
It's tinier than an ant.

2008
02:36:37,550 --> 02:36:41,870
In this whole microcosm of space.

2009
02:36:48,330 --> 02:36:49,650
Outer Wilds theme.

2010
02:37:05,430 --> 02:37:08,010
Wow, wow, wow.

2011
02:37:13,810 --> 02:37:14,730
Nerd.

2012
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:22,790
I thought that was a fruit parfait for a second.

2013
02:37:25,790 --> 02:37:26,710
Loading!

2014
02:37:28,530 --> 02:37:29,450
Loading!

2015
02:37:29,970 --> 02:37:30,410
Loading!

2016
02:37:31,070 --> 02:37:33,610
Good morning, intel three exclamation points.

2017
02:37:35,710 --> 02:37:37,270
7 AM.

2018
02:37:40,730 --> 02:37:43,750
The relaxation room.

2019
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:49,380
I hear someone talking.

2020
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:52,180
Wait, these are the blueprints I found.

2021
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:58,070
Years ago.

2022
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:10,200
Do you guys feel relaxed?

2023
02:38:11,100 --> 02:38:13,040
Wish they restocked the popcorn though.

2024
02:38:22,440 --> 02:38:23,360
LOL

2025
02:38:27,990 --> 02:38:29,670
Nerd chill.

2026
02:38:34,390 --> 02:38:35,210
About us.

2027
02:38:35,850 --> 02:38:38,870
Hello, I'm Dr. Glenn Pierce.

2028
02:38:39,570 --> 02:38:40,930
Our mission.

2029
02:38:41,390 --> 02:38:43,130
Is perception truly reality?

2030
02:38:43,550 --> 02:38:48,030
That's the question we... you... are trying to answer.

2031
02:38:49,470 --> 02:38:50,210
Sorry.

2032
02:38:50,770 --> 02:38:55,210
Our DICE exhibit will astound and may... and maze you.

2033
02:38:55,210 --> 02:38:57,300
It will amaze us.

2034
02:38:58,930 --> 02:39:05,690
Beyond your brain's cognitive limit, thus opening your mind up to the new possibilities found within this dimension.

2035
02:39:06,290 --> 02:39:08,150
What does all this really mean?

2036
02:39:08,570 --> 02:39:10,290
We don't know, but that's okay.

2037
02:39:10,850 --> 02:39:12,110
We're working on it.

2038
02:39:13,730 --> 02:39:15,650
This is where the music is coming from.

2039
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:24,980
Why does it do that?

2040
02:39:31,650 --> 02:39:32,310
Doctor?

2041
02:39:32,310 --> 02:39:35,950
Hello, my name is Dr. Glenn Pierce.

2042
02:39:36,770 --> 02:39:42,390
This is a notification that you have reappeared on our monitoring system after a prolonged absence.

2043
02:39:42,670 --> 02:39:43,050
We're back!

2044
02:39:43,350 --> 02:39:46,150
Please continue to do whatever you did most recently.

2045
02:39:46,690 --> 02:39:50,610
And discontinue whatever you were doing immediately prior to that.

2046
02:39:50,890 --> 02:39:52,930
Years ago,

2047
02:39:56,980 --> 02:39:58,380
I had a dream.

2048
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:01,580
Dream, dream, dream, dream.

2049
02:40:02,160 --> 02:40:03,880
Dream, dream, dream, dream.

2050
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:06,780
Years ago.

2051
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:09,140
Thank you for all your hard work, you're doing great.

2052
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:10,280
Thank you!

2053
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:13,980
Thank you, thank you for the superchat.

2054
02:40:15,820 --> 02:40:17,380
And we're back, baby.

2055
02:40:18,520 --> 02:40:20,780
Even that's back, baby.

2056
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:25,000
And our drink machine is back, baby.

2057
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:27,900
Two diet sodas.

2058
02:40:28,700 --> 02:40:29,280
Lucky.

2059
02:40:51,880 --> 02:40:52,400
Uh...

2060
02:40:55,180 --> 02:40:55,700
Everybody?

2061
02:40:56,780 --> 02:40:58,460
I have an announcement to make.

2062
02:41:03,020 --> 02:41:04,980
I drank the last of the milk.

2063
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:06,940
And I did not replace it.

2064
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:20,000
Why do we feel smaller?

2065
02:41:22,380 --> 02:41:23,840
Wait, we are smaller.

2066
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:25,200
Why are we so much smaller?

2067
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:26,500
What?

2068
02:41:26,900 --> 02:41:27,280
Wait.

2069
02:41:28,940 --> 02:41:31,540
I've become...I'm a baby now.

2070
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:34,480
I've returned to my childhood.

2071
02:41:35,820 --> 02:41:37,140
I can't meet the height.

2072
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:40,640
Will you guys think I'm literally the smallest creature in existence?

2073
02:41:42,520 --> 02:41:43,560
It's not true.

2074
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:46,640
Oh, this one didn't even give us so many sodas.

2075
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:53,240
Surely this isn't one of those shrinking hallways though, right?

2076
02:41:57,730 --> 02:41:58,290
Wait.

2077
02:41:58,950 --> 02:41:59,550
Wait.

2078
02:42:00,510 --> 02:42:01,290
Was that a different...

2079
02:42:05,870 --> 02:42:07,370
Here it is.

2080
02:42:08,370 --> 02:42:09,650
What's in this area?

2081
02:42:09,750 --> 02:42:10,110
Hold on.

2082
02:42:11,570 --> 02:42:14,070
This might have like a blueprint around here somewhere, maybe.

2083
02:42:14,370 --> 02:42:17,570
On the back or on the sides or on the...

2084
02:42:17,570 --> 02:42:18,770
The other sides?

2085
02:42:23,980 --> 02:42:24,300
No?

2086
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:26,720
Okay.

2087
02:42:30,480 --> 02:42:31,900
Shrink the house?

2088
02:42:38,380 --> 02:42:38,940
Why?

2089
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:43,100
Oh, is it because it's too big?

2090
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:55,840
Oh wait, I need to make it smaller.

2091
02:42:56,980 --> 02:42:58,920
Gotta make it the right size.

2092
02:42:59,700 --> 02:43:01,140
Or I need to make it bigger.

2093
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:04,320
Like that.

2094
02:43:04,940 --> 02:43:05,500
So...

2095
02:43:06,140 --> 02:43:08,080
Thank you so much for the gift, dude.

2096
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:10,120
This should be good, right?

2097
02:43:14,790 --> 02:43:18,090
I'm just a... I'm a huge actually.

2098
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:39,980
This game is so fun.

2099
02:43:42,520 --> 02:43:44,600
We're back in the back rooms.

2100
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:46,240
Doctor!

2101
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:46,680
Doctor!

2102
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:49,160
Doctor, I'm not supposed to be here!

2103
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:50,300
Doctor!

2104
02:43:51,660 --> 02:43:52,100
Doctor!

2105
02:43:56,240 --> 02:43:57,880
I'm not supposed to be here!

2106
02:43:58,380 --> 02:43:59,500
Is he getting the music with us?

2107
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:07,400
We're back to spooky.

2108
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:38,800
Person turned off by perception inhibitor.

2109
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:43,540
We saw this one before too.

2110
02:44:44,660 --> 02:44:47,220
It's a little unsettling, but you know...

2111
02:44:47,220 --> 02:44:50,340
Oh, that seems kind of really dangerous.

2112
02:44:53,180 --> 02:44:53,700
Nothing?

2113
02:44:53,860 --> 02:44:54,040
Okay.

2114
02:44:54,040 --> 02:44:57,540
I'm just gonna...

2115
02:44:57,540 --> 02:44:59,000
P

2116
02:45:02,200 --> 02:45:04,240
.T.?

2117
02:45:06,810 --> 02:45:08,220
P.T.?

2118
02:45:09,190 --> 02:45:10,080
Actual P.T.

2119
02:45:10,160 --> 02:45:10,480
moment?

2120
02:45:13,800 --> 02:45:15,060
Back to calm.

2121
02:45:17,910 --> 02:45:19,220
Follow the cable back?

2122
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:20,340
Let's try it.

2123
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:32,640
Something on the TV now?

2124
02:45:34,880 --> 02:45:35,780
Oh, no.

2125
02:45:36,020 --> 02:45:36,960
This is where I was.

2126
02:45:37,100 --> 02:45:37,600
Just kidding.

2127
02:45:39,800 --> 02:45:40,680
Nothing changed.

2128
02:45:41,900 --> 02:45:42,760
I got one guide.

2129
02:45:47,660 --> 02:45:48,760
The only me is me.

2130
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:51,700
Are you sure the only you is you?

2131
02:45:54,240 --> 02:45:55,500
Oh, plug it in.

2132
02:45:55,580 --> 02:45:56,420
Can I actually do that?

2133
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:00,860
I can't.

2134
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:03,980
It does not allow...

2135
02:46:05,460 --> 02:46:07,300
Maybe this guy is ruining the vibe.

2136
02:46:09,360 --> 02:46:10,400
Nope, okay.

2137
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:11,100
We continue.

2138
02:46:17,220 --> 02:46:19,220
This looks like a fancy hotel.

2139
02:46:23,220 --> 02:46:24,420
It's Jenga!

2140
02:46:32,200 --> 02:46:33,140
Oh!

2141
02:46:40,550 --> 02:46:44,290
Okay, that's enough!

2142
02:46:44,790 --> 02:46:45,210
Thank you.

2143
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:07,220
Big fan by the way.

2144
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:08,520
No kidding.

2145
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:13,760
It's wet.

2146
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:16,480
Do I

2147
02:47:34,070 --> 02:47:35,310
need to make it bigger?

2148
02:47:37,810 --> 02:47:38,950
Can I move this?

2149
02:47:39,030 --> 02:47:39,730
I cannot.

2150
02:47:44,590 --> 02:47:45,150
Window?

2151
02:47:45,150 --> 02:47:46,070
Which window?

2152
02:47:51,540 --> 02:47:52,100
Window.

2153
02:47:52,820 --> 02:47:53,280
Minky.

2154
02:47:54,060 --> 02:47:55,700
That's my name, don't wear it out.

2155
02:47:58,950 --> 02:48:02,010
I like how you can see the brick wall on each side.

2156
02:48:04,110 --> 02:48:05,230
Any window.

2157
02:48:07,250 --> 02:48:08,070
What's happening?

2158
02:48:08,410 --> 02:48:09,290
Where am I?

2159
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:11,570
Guys, where am I?

2160
02:48:17,190 --> 02:48:18,230
What just happened?

2161
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:30,100
Can I open it up?

2162
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:32,360
How do I get inside though?

2163
02:48:35,930 --> 02:48:36,830
Let me in!

2164
02:48:50,960 --> 02:48:52,380
Oh we are tiny now.

2165
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:53,840
Oh no, I made us too tiny!

2166
02:48:56,380 --> 02:48:57,060
Nevermind!

2167
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:59,800
I made us the perfect height.

2168
02:49:04,420 --> 02:49:05,380
What happened?

2169
02:49:08,680 --> 02:49:09,700
Why did I hit that suitcase?

2170
02:49:17,130 --> 02:49:18,090
First school.

2171
02:49:21,390 --> 02:49:23,210
The locker room.

2172
02:49:24,290 --> 02:49:27,550
I sure hope there is no one in the showers.

2173
02:49:28,850 --> 02:49:31,330
This needs a little scrub-a-dub.

2174
02:49:32,210 --> 02:49:32,970
I sure hope not.

2175
02:49:34,790 --> 02:49:35,730
Look up?

2176
02:49:58,850 --> 02:49:59,470
Don't focus on negativity.

2177
02:50:00,070 --> 02:50:11,570
It won't spare you from the cage of death, the pain of disease, the cruelty of time, the cold shell of human nature, or the eventual loss of everything you've ever held dear.

2178
02:50:12,230 --> 02:50:15,030
Whatever you do, don't focus on that.

2179
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:25,360
Good advice, man.

2180
02:50:32,480 --> 02:50:33,820
Thanks, Dr. Glenn.

2181
02:50:34,420 --> 02:50:35,440
Thank you, Dr. Glenn.

2182
02:50:37,440 --> 02:50:38,120
Thank you.

2183
02:50:44,200 --> 02:50:46,540
I think I messed that up a little bit.

2184
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:47,500
There we go.

2185
02:50:50,140 --> 02:50:52,740
Why are they becoming such liminal spaces now?

2186
02:50:57,870 --> 02:50:58,790
I'm going to do it.

2187
02:50:58,830 --> 02:51:00,890
I'm going to do the world's biggest cannonball!

2188
02:51:06,770 --> 02:51:08,810
Then literally everyone dies.

2189
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:15,940
Danger.

2190
02:51:16,120 --> 02:51:17,460
High voltage.

2191
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:21,800
This machine is remotely controlled and may start without warning.

2192
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:23,920
Don't like that.

2193
02:51:27,140 --> 02:51:27,980
I'm venting.

2194
02:51:43,600 --> 02:51:44,020
Oops.

2195
02:51:45,080 --> 02:51:45,780
Oh shoot.

2196
02:51:46,280 --> 02:51:47,680
I actually don't know where it went.

2197
02:51:47,800 --> 02:51:48,300
Hold on.

2198
02:51:52,700 --> 02:51:54,100
Where do we need to land it?

2199
02:51:54,220 --> 02:51:55,320
Oh, up there I think.

2200
02:51:55,460 --> 02:51:56,180
Okay, okay, okay.

2201
02:51:56,320 --> 02:51:57,900
I see what we need to do.

2202
02:51:59,860 --> 02:52:02,520
What if I just made it the largest thing ever though?

2203
02:52:03,280 --> 02:52:05,000
We could get there ourselves.

2204
02:52:08,540 --> 02:52:09,940
Guys, I think I messed up.

2205
02:52:10,220 --> 02:52:13,540
Guys, I think I made it too big!

2206
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:15,000
I made it too big!

2207
02:52:15,460 --> 02:52:17,760
You guys, I'm stuck inside the...I'm stuck in the floaty.

2208
02:52:19,140 --> 02:52:19,820
Just kidding.

2209
02:52:20,580 --> 02:52:21,780
Just kidding.

2210
02:52:22,820 --> 02:52:23,600
Let me in!

2211
02:52:23,820 --> 02:52:24,800
Oh I'm so slow.

2212
02:52:25,020 --> 02:52:26,820
You guys, I'm so slow.

2213
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:31,120
Guys, I'm crawling out of worm space.

2214
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:34,380
Oh god, things are starting to glitch out.

2215
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:36,860
Oh no!

2216
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:42,560
I'm so small I have to jump over every individual vent.

2217
02:52:49,150 --> 02:52:50,490
I'm so tiny.

2218
02:52:50,970 --> 02:52:53,550
Oh my gosh, I'm literally pocket sized.

2219
02:52:54,610 --> 02:52:55,950
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2220
02:52:58,150 --> 02:53:00,690
I'm so slow.

2221
02:53:04,730 --> 02:53:07,090
How did I make it so big?

2222
02:53:13,610 --> 02:53:15,390
Oh, can I make it up?

2223
02:53:15,550 --> 02:53:17,890
Wait, I don't think I can see above the thing.

2224
02:53:18,110 --> 02:53:18,790
Oh please.

2225
02:53:19,790 --> 02:53:20,650
No please!

2226
02:53:21,090 --> 02:53:24,730
I'm too small to do the puzzle.

2227
02:53:27,690 --> 02:53:30,150
No, I have to go back.

2228
02:53:43,680 --> 02:53:45,260
No please!

2229
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:47,560
10cm Minky!

2230
02:53:48,300 --> 02:53:48,980
No!

2231
02:53:51,500 --> 02:53:53,980
I'm bigger than that.

2232
02:53:54,620 --> 02:53:57,480
Oh it's really distorting right here, isn't it?

2233
02:53:57,820 --> 02:53:58,120
OK.

2234
02:54:03,720 --> 02:54:04,480
OK.

2235
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:13,720
Alright, we'll get it this time.

2236
02:54:14,260 --> 02:54:17,580
I'm so small I can probably go into the outlet.

2237
02:54:20,040 --> 02:54:20,640
OK.

2238
02:54:26,020 --> 02:54:28,120
Feels good, right guys?

2239
02:54:28,460 --> 02:54:30,220
Why am I so slow still?

2240
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:33,760
I think the room is just big maybe.

2241
02:54:34,260 --> 02:54:34,980
Wait, where is the door?

2242
02:54:37,240 --> 02:54:37,740
Please.

2243
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:39,280
OK.

2244
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:40,420
Alright.

2245
02:54:41,460 --> 02:54:42,640
OK, let's try this again.

2246
02:54:42,780 --> 02:54:42,880
No?

2247
02:54:45,080 --> 02:54:46,500
Oh, not there.

2248
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:47,260
Down here.

2249
02:54:47,380 --> 02:54:47,660
Thank you.

2250
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:57,200
I'm so slow.

2251
02:54:59,020 --> 02:55:00,700
Can I get up still?

2252
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:02,200
OK, there we go.

2253
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:03,720
Oh shoot.

2254
02:55:03,900 --> 02:55:05,380
OK, just a bit bigger.

2255
02:55:06,940 --> 02:55:08,440
OK, in we go.

2256
02:55:08,580 --> 02:55:08,940
Alright!

2257
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:12,180
OK guys, now I know what to do.

2258
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,180
Just like that.

2259
02:55:28,550 --> 02:55:30,390
I'm still really small.

2260
02:55:31,610 --> 02:55:33,010
Can I get bigger please?

2261
02:55:33,890 --> 02:55:37,110
Sorry, I just wanted to make a biblically accurate size video.

2262
02:55:37,770 --> 02:55:38,550
Thanks Bald.

2263
02:55:38,990 --> 02:55:40,910
Thanks, I paused the game for that.

2264
02:55:43,130 --> 02:55:45,110
No seriously, thank you so much for the super chat.

2265
02:55:45,290 --> 02:55:45,830
Thank you!

2266
02:55:47,450 --> 02:55:48,330
Hello sir!

2267
02:56:03,010 --> 02:56:05,010
I'm a beater.

2268
02:56:15,710 --> 02:56:17,070
Like real?

2269
02:56:17,610 --> 02:56:19,590
I've been told that so many times.

2270
02:56:21,010 --> 02:56:23,290
Dr. Glenn Pierce please.

2271
02:56:24,510 --> 02:56:26,750
You can't be lying to me anymore.

2272
02:56:36,610 --> 02:56:41,890
Biblically big brain...I can't speak.

2273
02:56:43,790 --> 02:56:44,750
Wait,

2274
02:56:57,260 --> 02:56:58,820
what leads to where?

2275
02:57:02,980 --> 02:57:04,340
Dr. Glenn Pippi.

2276
02:57:04,700 --> 02:57:06,020
That's not his name.

2277
02:57:13,280 --> 02:57:15,760
Does this exit into this?

2278
02:57:18,600 --> 02:57:19,480
Sure does.

2279
02:57:19,640 --> 02:57:21,560
And then this exits into this.

2280
02:57:22,360 --> 02:57:24,580
So one makes me big and one makes me small.

2281
02:57:27,780 --> 02:57:29,180
Oh wait, no it doesn't.

2282
02:57:29,320 --> 02:57:30,180
Now I'm extra small.

2283
02:57:30,280 --> 02:57:31,660
Oh shoot, I need to get extra big.

2284
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:32,540
OK, hold on.

2285
02:57:33,220 --> 02:57:33,860
We need to get bigger.

2286
02:57:37,600 --> 02:57:38,820
OK, like so.

2287
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:40,380
And then make this a bit bigger.

2288
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:43,100
OK.

2289
02:57:45,340 --> 02:57:45,780
Bigger.

2290
02:57:46,740 --> 02:57:49,560
Wait, but then how do I fit through?

2291
02:57:54,850 --> 02:57:56,250
OK, we got this.

2292
02:57:56,290 --> 02:57:57,470
We got this guys.

2293
02:57:57,570 --> 02:57:58,210
We got this.

2294
02:58:01,190 --> 02:58:02,330
One second.

2295
02:58:04,550 --> 02:58:07,350
We are actually thinking with portals right now.

2296
02:58:13,860 --> 02:58:15,060
So close!

2297
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:16,060
So close!

2298
02:58:16,480 --> 02:58:16,960
Please!

2299
02:58:19,440 --> 02:58:20,240
Please!

2300
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:23,240
Do you think maybe...

2301
02:58:26,660 --> 02:58:28,280
I can jump in there.

2302
02:58:28,960 --> 02:58:29,740
I cannot.

2303
02:58:32,800 --> 02:58:34,080
I'm too big.

2304
02:58:34,140 --> 02:58:34,940
No I'm not.

2305
02:58:35,380 --> 02:58:36,500
I know how to crouch.

2306
02:58:40,450 --> 02:58:42,470
OK, I became a little smaller.

2307
02:58:44,950 --> 02:58:46,470
I became a little smaller.

2308
02:58:46,830 --> 02:58:47,450
That should be good.

2309
02:58:47,810 --> 02:58:47,990
No?

2310
02:58:51,610 --> 02:58:52,390
OK, nice.

2311
02:58:54,430 --> 02:58:55,250
Oh shoot.

2312
02:58:55,470 --> 02:58:55,970
OK, hold on.

2313
02:58:56,270 --> 02:58:56,790
Oh no!

2314
02:59:04,010 --> 02:59:05,850
I'm not so big.

2315
02:59:07,850 --> 02:59:09,090
I'm not so big.

2316
02:59:11,150 --> 02:59:13,430
Wait, why can't I walk on this now?

2317
02:59:13,510 --> 02:59:13,870
There we go.

2318
02:59:20,790 --> 02:59:21,750
Oh please!

2319
02:59:24,570 --> 02:59:25,050
Please!

2320
02:59:25,410 --> 02:59:26,570
I need to be even smaller!

2321
02:59:26,570 --> 02:59:26,830
Smaller!

2322
02:59:29,990 --> 02:59:31,170
Maybe like this.

2323
02:59:31,410 --> 02:59:32,610
I'm too thick!

2324
02:59:33,190 --> 02:59:34,970
I can't help this ass man.

2325
02:59:35,810 --> 02:59:37,810
I've tried everything to get rid of it.

2326
02:59:39,910 --> 02:59:42,090
The ass is here to stay I think.

2327
02:59:45,670 --> 02:59:46,190
Please.

2328
02:59:57,080 --> 02:59:57,600
Please!

2329
02:59:59,860 --> 03:00:03,180
OK, I think we are small enough.

2330
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:04,280
Now we just need to...

2331
03:00:06,410 --> 03:00:07,340
Get in.

2332
03:00:08,130 --> 03:00:10,100
We just need to...

2333
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:13,520
We just need to make it...

2334
03:00:14,260 --> 03:00:15,220
Up.

2335
03:00:16,560 --> 03:00:16,900
Right?

2336
03:00:17,240 --> 03:00:17,660
OK.

2337
03:00:24,480 --> 03:00:25,420
Easy!

2338
03:00:26,980 --> 03:00:28,420
Oh my god, Andy's room.

2339
03:00:29,080 --> 03:00:36,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2340
03:00:37,860 --> 03:00:39,080
She did it the wrong way?

2341
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:40,360
Wait, what?

2342
03:00:43,360 --> 03:00:46,600
You could have just put the door in the keyhole.

2343
03:00:47,700 --> 03:00:47,880
Oh.

2344
03:01:00,690 --> 03:01:01,450
My bad.

2345
03:01:03,590 --> 03:01:04,390
Oh no.

2346
03:01:04,710 --> 03:01:08,410
OK, well we are really slow too so it's going to take us as long as...

2347
03:01:08,410 --> 03:01:08,690
No!

2348
03:01:09,130 --> 03:01:10,190
Please, come here.

2349
03:01:10,930 --> 03:01:11,770
No, like bigger.

2350
03:01:12,110 --> 03:01:12,210
Here.

2351
03:01:15,980 --> 03:01:16,620
It worked.

2352
03:01:19,100 --> 03:01:20,580
It did technically work.

2353
03:01:21,240 --> 03:01:21,860
Oh my gosh.

2354
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:23,840
These are excruciating.

2355
03:01:23,980 --> 03:01:25,220
They are so slow.

2356
03:01:26,920 --> 03:01:29,860
Please, can I walk any faster than this?

2357
03:01:42,030 --> 03:01:44,410
I'm trying to walk through...

2358
03:01:44,410 --> 03:01:46,890
Sneak through this keyhole but my ass is too big.

2359
03:01:47,930 --> 03:01:49,250
That's totally how it goes.

2360
03:01:49,390 --> 03:01:50,070
Bring it closer.

2361
03:01:58,380 --> 03:01:59,980
I think it landed on me.

2362
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:02,100
Wait, excuse me.

2363
03:02:02,760 --> 03:02:04,520
Excuse me, you can...oh wait.

2364
03:02:04,820 --> 03:02:05,920
No, I made it too big.

2365
03:02:05,920 --> 03:02:07,060
Oh no.

2366
03:02:13,580 --> 03:02:15,220
Sorry, I'm getting hungry.

2367
03:02:16,980 --> 03:02:18,640
So I was eating a snack.

2368
03:02:19,260 --> 03:02:21,540
Wait, I think I need to make it smaller.

2369
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:22,480
Like that.

2370
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:24,300
There we go.

2371
03:02:27,360 --> 03:02:29,340
But just also a little bit smaller.

2372
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:33,360
There we go.

2373
03:02:37,720 --> 03:02:40,500
5 to 6 dreams is the absolute limit.

2374
03:02:42,820 --> 03:02:44,140
How many are we on?

2375
03:02:44,940 --> 03:02:45,600
What am I eating?

2376
03:02:45,780 --> 03:02:47,140
I'm eating some goldfish.

2377
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:50,700
I'll have dinner after.

2378
03:03:02,240 --> 03:03:05,340
Meeting for Cardboard Lovers Association.

2379
03:03:07,780 --> 03:03:08,380
Yeah!

2380
03:03:09,780 --> 03:03:11,240
I'm eating goldfish.

2381
03:03:11,320 --> 03:03:12,780
You guys know goldfish crackers?

2382
03:03:14,340 --> 03:03:15,780
These are the best ones.

2383
03:03:26,400 --> 03:03:27,000
Hello?

2384
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:28,680
Oh, we started immediately.

2385
03:03:35,180 --> 03:03:35,940
Wait, no!

2386
03:03:36,720 --> 03:03:36,940
No!

2387
03:03:37,360 --> 03:03:38,000
No, no, no!

2388
03:03:38,220 --> 03:03:38,900
Not yet!

2389
03:03:45,080 --> 03:03:45,660
Okay.

2390
03:03:50,820 --> 03:03:51,800
Hi Minto.

2391
03:03:52,120 --> 03:03:52,380
Hello!

2392
03:03:54,520 --> 03:03:55,100
Detour.

2393
03:03:56,200 --> 03:03:57,000
Detour, eh?

2394
03:03:58,920 --> 03:03:59,960
Go tour.

2395
03:04:01,460 --> 03:04:01,880
Coffee.

2396
03:04:05,890 --> 03:04:06,870
Wait, bad ending?

2397
03:04:07,270 --> 03:04:07,570
Really?

2398
03:04:08,110 --> 03:04:08,490
Uh oh.

2399
03:04:08,730 --> 03:04:10,110
Wait, are there multiple endings in this game?

2400
03:04:10,510 --> 03:04:12,670
I imagine this is the type of game that has that.

2401
03:04:14,930 --> 03:04:17,470
If only...oh, the paint!

2402
03:04:18,330 --> 03:04:19,550
This is real paint.

2403
03:04:34,750 --> 03:04:35,190
Okay.

2404
03:04:37,310 --> 03:04:38,670
Then what are you going to do about it?

2405
03:04:39,490 --> 03:04:39,930
Lady?

2406
03:04:39,930 --> 03:04:39,950
Lady?

2407
03:04:44,770 --> 03:04:47,530
I'm a loose screw.

2408
03:04:57,150 --> 03:04:58,030
Reformulating?

2409
03:04:58,270 --> 03:04:59,430
I want to go in here.

2410
03:04:59,910 --> 03:05:00,310
Danger.

2411
03:05:01,990 --> 03:05:03,770
I'm not anyone.

2412
03:05:03,950 --> 03:05:05,450
I'm not like other girls.

2413
03:05:05,590 --> 03:05:10,650
You can't place me in a box and not expect me to break out.

2414
03:05:12,890 --> 03:05:16,190
I'm wild and crazy and unpredictable.

2415
03:05:30,670 --> 03:05:32,670
They're telling me to wake up I think.

2416
03:05:45,270 --> 03:05:49,890
Yeah, nobody puts Minto in the corner.

2417
03:05:50,610 --> 03:05:53,610
Wait, it's 3AM again.

2418
03:05:57,640 --> 03:05:58,080
Mmhm.

2419
03:06:02,010 --> 03:06:03,870
Mao Mao, thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

2420
03:06:06,510 --> 03:06:07,270
Bye bye!

2421
03:06:14,100 --> 03:06:14,460
Uh oh.

2422
03:06:15,960 --> 03:06:16,640
Uh oh.

2423
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:20,240
I bet I could put you in a box if Snake was also in it.

2424
03:06:24,660 --> 03:06:26,200
Completely different situation.

2425
03:06:30,940 --> 03:06:32,220
We need to break out!

2426
03:06:44,930 --> 03:06:46,650
That was wild!

2427
03:06:46,790 --> 03:06:47,750
Oh my god!

2428
03:06:51,130 --> 03:06:54,750
We got big ol' cucumbers and carrots.

2429
03:06:55,290 --> 03:06:56,730
Diet soda.

2430
03:07:06,070 --> 03:07:08,270
If I just keep running...

2431
03:07:08,270 --> 03:07:14,210
I think this does not count as kidnapping.

2432
03:07:16,310 --> 03:07:19,530
Does this not count as like a...

2433
03:07:22,530 --> 03:07:25,530
I think this is like a...

2434
03:07:26,290 --> 03:07:27,610
Oh boy, 3AM.

2435
03:07:32,740 --> 03:07:34,540
Is my vision going black?

2436
03:07:36,100 --> 03:07:36,960
Sweet A!

2437
03:07:37,280 --> 03:07:37,740
Sweet A!

2438
03:07:38,560 --> 03:07:39,520
Knock, knock, knock!

2439
03:07:39,800 --> 03:07:40,300
Sweet A!

2440
03:07:40,480 --> 03:07:40,880
Sweet A!

2441
03:07:40,980 --> 03:07:41,540
Sweet G!

2442
03:07:41,840 --> 03:07:42,040
A!

2443
03:07:42,280 --> 03:07:42,500
G!

2444
03:07:42,760 --> 03:07:43,060
A!

2445
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:43,540
Sweet G!

2446
03:07:43,960 --> 03:07:44,500
Sweet G!

2447
03:07:45,200 --> 03:07:46,060
Sweet B!

2448
03:07:46,400 --> 03:07:47,940
Oh my little sweet B!

2449
03:07:48,740 --> 03:07:49,500
Motion sickness?

2450
03:07:51,400 --> 03:07:53,140
Is this the motion sickness part?

2451
03:08:09,260 --> 03:08:11,680
I'm actually not sure where to go.

2452
03:08:12,880 --> 03:08:14,160
The music is kind of crazy though.

2453
03:08:18,750 --> 03:08:20,610
It will be fine for you, probably.

2454
03:08:23,170 --> 03:08:24,670
Mickey's big ass adventure.

2455
03:08:30,350 --> 03:08:31,390
Wake up!

2456
03:08:34,570 --> 03:08:35,350
What was that?

2457
03:08:35,390 --> 03:08:37,870
What was the thing from Stranger Things?

2458
03:08:37,870 --> 03:08:40,510
I got it!

2459
03:08:40,590 --> 03:08:41,310
I got it!

2460
03:08:41,490 --> 03:08:43,150
Minto, wake up!

2461
03:08:43,710 --> 03:08:45,690
I don't like this!

2462
03:08:46,230 --> 03:08:47,670
Minto, wake up!

2463
03:08:50,730 --> 03:08:52,210
There we go, we got it.

2464
03:08:58,780 --> 03:08:59,740
Just a little bit bigger.

2465
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:07,520
Doctor!

2466
03:09:12,500 --> 03:09:14,400
My name is Doctor Glenn Pierce.

2467
03:09:14,960 --> 03:09:18,800
Thank you for completing the Somnuscult Standard Orientation Protocol.

2468
03:09:19,720 --> 03:09:26,960
Before you begin the first phase of therapy, I'd like to briefly describe the finite and fragile nature of the dream state.

2469
03:09:30,700 --> 03:09:32,020
Amelia, welcome to membership!

2470
03:09:32,900 --> 03:09:34,380
Waking a ghost ma...

2471
03:09:34,380 --> 03:09:36,280
Wait, waking up a ghost maid at 3AM?

2472
03:09:36,460 --> 03:09:37,140
Gone wrong.

2473
03:09:53,230 --> 03:09:56,090
If I can't be happy, I'll never let them be happy.

2474
03:09:56,730 --> 03:09:58,770
I'm going to pull every single alarm in here.

2475
03:10:03,290 --> 03:10:04,230
We're looping?

2476
03:10:05,330 --> 03:10:06,570
We do be looping.

2477
03:10:10,090 --> 03:10:11,290
Nevermind, just kidding.

2478
03:10:11,750 --> 03:10:13,310
We do not be looping.

2479
03:10:19,530 --> 03:10:20,050
OK

2480
03:10:28,090 --> 03:10:30,050
Going forward into the darkness.

2481
03:10:32,990 --> 03:10:34,230
It's spooky.

2482
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:38,460
Am I actually walking?

2483
03:10:40,040 --> 03:10:40,480
No.

2484
03:10:42,280 --> 03:10:43,820
Where do I need to go?

2485
03:10:50,170 --> 03:10:52,350
Maybe back through here?

2486
03:10:55,110 --> 03:10:56,330
OK, OK, OK.

2487
03:11:01,210 --> 03:11:01,970
Give me my soda.

2488
03:11:06,090 --> 03:11:06,570
Nice.

2489
03:11:20,050 --> 03:11:21,610
It's so disorienting.

2490
03:11:21,710 --> 03:11:24,410
I can't really tell which direction I'm...

2491
03:11:24,410 --> 03:11:25,910
I need to go up though.

2492
03:11:35,830 --> 03:11:36,870
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.

2493
03:11:43,110 --> 03:11:44,250
There we go.

2494
03:11:44,250 --> 03:11:45,790
Oh, wait.

2495
03:11:46,830 --> 03:11:48,850
Do I go up or do I go through here?

2496
03:11:50,190 --> 03:11:52,150
Well, I made my decision just now.

2497
03:11:58,200 --> 03:11:59,580
I don't think I can make it.

2498
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:00,680
I don't think I can go back.

2499
03:12:01,480 --> 03:12:03,140
No, my bad.

2500
03:12:05,020 --> 03:12:06,340
Up is an easter egg.

2501
03:12:06,580 --> 03:12:07,420
OK, OK.

2502
03:12:16,440 --> 03:12:18,080
Anything else I can grab?

2503
03:12:18,240 --> 03:12:18,400
No?

2504
03:12:20,220 --> 03:12:21,380
We go through.

2505
03:12:22,680 --> 03:12:23,440
Hello Doctor.

2506
03:12:41,680 --> 03:12:43,280
Anything over here?

2507
03:12:44,840 --> 03:12:47,560
I thought I just fell down into the void.

2508
03:12:47,560 --> 03:12:50,160
Doesn't seem like it, OK.

2509
03:12:51,460 --> 03:12:52,000
Doctor?

2510
03:12:53,180 --> 03:12:56,460
Doctor, I don't think this is part of the...I thought these were feet.

2511
03:12:56,820 --> 03:12:58,660
I thought they were feet sticking out.

2512
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:02,060
Motion sickness warning for the next few segments.

2513
03:13:02,780 --> 03:13:03,780
Thank you.

2514
03:13:04,100 --> 03:13:05,280
Oh, we got our block.

2515
03:13:07,340 --> 03:13:07,880
Come on.

2516
03:13:11,380 --> 03:13:13,020
We are back to normal.

2517
03:13:17,420 --> 03:13:18,680
All the way up there?

2518
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:19,060
OK.

2519
03:13:24,660 --> 03:13:25,360
Oh!

2520
03:13:27,780 --> 03:13:28,480
Why

2521
03:13:35,420 --> 03:13:37,000
is the music all serious?

2522
03:13:37,760 --> 03:13:38,280
What's happening?

2523
03:13:47,270 --> 03:13:49,270
Sorry for breaking your stuff.

2524
03:13:49,650 --> 03:13:50,450
I'm so sorry.

2525
03:13:51,410 --> 03:13:52,750
Sorry, sorry.

2526
03:13:53,090 --> 03:13:53,890
Can I get back up there?

2527
03:13:56,930 --> 03:13:58,930
I feel like we probably could.

2528
03:13:59,530 --> 03:14:00,830
I really tried.

2529
03:14:01,210 --> 03:14:01,510
No?

2530
03:14:03,410 --> 03:14:03,850
No!

2531
03:14:04,330 --> 03:14:04,710
No!

2532
03:14:05,130 --> 03:14:05,630
The floor!

2533
03:14:07,810 --> 03:14:08,530
Oh, shoot.

2534
03:14:10,230 --> 03:14:11,610
I feel like we could.

2535
03:14:16,060 --> 03:14:18,420
It's like pretty high up though, isn't it?

2536
03:14:18,820 --> 03:14:19,940
Is that another easter egg?

2537
03:14:22,560 --> 03:14:24,840
If I were to have made it to the top...

2538
03:14:24,840 --> 03:14:25,960
Oh, wait.

2539
03:14:26,500 --> 03:14:27,620
Guys, I can't see anything.

2540
03:14:30,380 --> 03:14:31,180
OK, we're fine.

2541
03:14:35,940 --> 03:14:37,000
No.

2542
03:14:38,850 --> 03:14:40,520
I'm just going to go in here.

2543
03:14:42,540 --> 03:14:44,360
Just be tall.

2544
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:45,800
True.

2545
03:15:05,450 --> 03:15:08,030
Perception is not reality.

2546
03:15:16,450 --> 03:15:17,950
What's that sound?

2547
03:15:25,690 --> 03:15:27,090
What was that?

2548
03:15:34,040 --> 03:15:34,810
P.T.

2549
03:15:42,440 --> 03:15:44,120
Oh no, it's this puzzle.

2550
03:15:48,840 --> 03:15:49,320
What...

2551
03:15:50,820 --> 03:15:52,340
do I need to perceive?

2552
03:15:54,140 --> 03:15:56,320
What do I need to perceive?

2553
03:16:01,420 --> 03:16:02,920
I'm tempted to backseat?

2554
03:16:03,280 --> 03:16:03,900
No, no, no.

2555
03:16:03,960 --> 03:16:05,540
Only if I ask for a hint.

2556
03:16:07,560 --> 03:16:08,520
Oh, Ding is correct.

2557
03:16:44,920 --> 03:16:45,620
Oh no.

2558
03:17:03,680 --> 03:17:04,880
What did I do wrong?

2559
03:17:05,080 --> 03:17:06,200
Wait, did I do something wrong?

2560
03:17:06,260 --> 03:17:07,000
Why are you guys staying?

2561
03:17:09,920 --> 03:17:11,480
Wait, what do you mean it's over?

2562
03:17:18,170 --> 03:17:18,610
Wait,

2563
03:17:39,200 --> 03:17:40,320
I think I might get it.

2564
03:17:45,430 --> 03:17:45,870
No!

2565
03:18:01,630 --> 03:18:02,350
Gold share!

2566
03:18:02,410 --> 03:18:04,190
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the 50 gifts!

2567
03:18:04,750 --> 03:18:06,230
Thank you!

2568
03:18:13,820 --> 03:18:15,040
Did I just mess it up?

2569
03:18:23,350 --> 03:18:27,590
OK, so do I... If it's pointing...

2570
03:18:33,070 --> 03:18:39,730
So basically my thought process was, if it's pointing towards these, I have to read them.

2571
03:18:40,730 --> 03:18:42,990
Or I have to look at this, or go down this way.

2572
03:18:46,630 --> 03:18:49,710
And then...

2573
03:18:49,710 --> 03:18:50,730
Then go.

2574
03:18:51,990 --> 03:18:58,050
But if it's only pointed towards the exit, I just go.

2575
03:19:02,420 --> 03:19:05,400
Wait, so like I look, and then I go?

2576
03:19:14,230 --> 03:19:16,430
So since I...

2577
03:19:22,370 --> 03:19:23,530
You almost got it.

2578
03:19:23,550 --> 03:19:24,330
Figured it out.

2579
03:19:34,290 --> 03:19:35,910
Digita, thank you so much for the super chat.

2580
03:20:12,920 --> 03:20:13,800
Maybe...Hold on.

2581
03:20:18,400 --> 03:20:19,380
Is it like this?

2582
03:20:27,820 --> 03:20:28,880
Underway, welcome to the membership.

2583
03:20:29,180 --> 03:20:29,500
Thank you!

2584
03:20:30,100 --> 03:20:32,200
I might need another pair of glasses for this one.

2585
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:34,280
You're so close!

2586
03:20:34,320 --> 03:20:34,940
I am!

2587
03:20:44,040 --> 03:20:47,690
I was doing so well before, when I wasn't even trying.

2588
03:21:02,350 --> 03:21:04,360
It's like the same now, so...

2589
03:21:07,290 --> 03:21:09,130
Oh, it's not the same anymore.

2590
03:21:12,450 --> 03:21:13,770
I don't understand!

2591
03:21:16,570 --> 03:21:17,150
No,

2592
03:21:24,680 --> 03:21:26,020
I don't think you can click on anything.

2593
03:21:26,020 --> 03:21:31,020
Can I get a small hint, but try not to be like so...

2594
03:21:33,200 --> 03:21:36,660
Try to be like really, you know, don't be so obvious.

2595
03:21:36,860 --> 03:21:37,280
Muffin!

2596
03:21:37,460 --> 03:21:37,920
Welcome to the membership.

2597
03:21:38,040 --> 03:21:38,560
Thank you.

2598
03:21:48,570 --> 03:21:50,230
Where you look matters, okay.

2599
03:21:50,690 --> 03:21:51,530
That's what I thought.

2600
03:21:52,970 --> 03:21:55,330
But I just don't know when to look and where not to look.

2601
03:21:57,590 --> 03:21:59,170
Perception is not reality.

2602
03:22:24,420 --> 03:22:25,720
My brain hurts!

2603
03:22:27,820 --> 03:22:29,380
Think about the order.

2604
03:23:11,170 --> 03:23:14,990
The door sign is always right, but I did it!

2605
03:23:16,330 --> 03:23:17,950
What do you mean you can't?

2606
03:23:17,990 --> 03:23:19,690
I can't look at it every time?

2607
03:23:24,110 --> 03:23:26,350
I'm just not gonna...

2608
03:23:26,350 --> 03:23:27,390
No, see?

2609
03:23:28,170 --> 03:23:29,270
I don't get it.

2610
03:23:29,730 --> 03:23:32,830
I'm looking and I'm doing... I don't know!

2611
03:23:34,570 --> 03:23:36,730
Thank you so much for the pink house.

2612
03:23:36,910 --> 03:23:38,030
Thank you.

2613
03:23:42,850 --> 03:23:45,190
Don't look in the direction of the door sign.

2614
03:23:46,710 --> 03:23:47,930
So like this.

2615
03:23:52,410 --> 03:23:52,650
I

2616
03:23:57,570 --> 03:23:59,770
had it, but I was just looking in the wrong direction.

2617
03:24:00,510 --> 03:24:04,550
Oh my... I had it, but I got it opposite.

2618
03:24:04,550 --> 03:24:04,810
That's it.

2619
03:24:16,080 --> 03:24:17,460
Backwards is not necessary.

2620
03:24:17,580 --> 03:24:17,940
It's okay.

2621
03:24:18,140 --> 03:24:19,240
I feel better doing it.

2622
03:24:19,320 --> 03:24:19,480
Wait.

2623
03:24:20,480 --> 03:24:24,920
I had it.

2624
03:24:25,080 --> 03:24:25,840
I was right.

2625
03:24:26,160 --> 03:24:28,000
I just was doing it...

2626
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:31,120
So I was saying you should look the way of the sign.

2627
03:24:32,040 --> 03:24:34,240
And then turn... And then walk backwards.

2628
03:24:34,640 --> 03:24:35,160
Whatever.

2629
03:24:35,400 --> 03:24:35,900
It's fine.

2630
03:24:36,640 --> 03:24:38,040
That word confuses me.

2631
03:24:38,800 --> 03:24:39,420
It's fine.

2632
03:24:39,460 --> 03:24:40,160
We made it through.

2633
03:24:40,920 --> 03:24:42,540
You know what that reminds me of?

2634
03:24:43,380 --> 03:24:44,580
Are those... Oh my gosh.

2635
03:24:44,700 --> 03:24:46,160
Have you ever had like those...

2636
03:24:48,420 --> 03:24:51,220
The... Those like stinking word games that's like...

2637
03:24:51,220 --> 03:24:52,120
I hate those things.

2638
03:24:52,180 --> 03:24:53,180
Where it's like...

2639
03:24:53,180 --> 03:24:56,460
I'm going to a party and I'm gonna bring...

2640
03:24:56,460 --> 03:24:57,100
Blah blah blah.

2641
03:24:57,680 --> 03:24:58,900
What are you gonna bring?

2642
03:24:59,360 --> 03:25:01,140
And you're like... I don't know.

2643
03:25:01,220 --> 03:25:01,660
And they're like...

2644
03:25:01,660 --> 03:25:03,260
My dice just disappeared.

2645
03:25:04,180 --> 03:25:04,780
They're like, no, no.

2646
03:25:04,840 --> 03:25:05,260
You'll get it.

2647
03:25:05,280 --> 03:25:07,540
You'll understand the word...

2648
03:25:07,540 --> 03:25:08,580
The word thing.

2649
03:25:09,680 --> 03:25:11,060
I hate those.

2650
03:25:11,620 --> 03:25:14,260
I hate those because I never understand them.

2651
03:25:17,600 --> 03:25:18,080
Smile.

2652
03:25:22,540 --> 03:25:23,480
Road closed.

2653
03:25:27,640 --> 03:25:28,960
Word logic puzzles.

2654
03:25:29,100 --> 03:25:29,400
Yeah!

2655
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:30,960
They drive me crazy.

2656
03:25:31,320 --> 03:25:32,180
They're like, you'll get it.

2657
03:25:32,880 --> 03:25:35,960
They never explain the puzzle but they'll be like, you'll get it.

2658
03:25:35,980 --> 03:25:36,460
You'll get it.

2659
03:25:37,360 --> 03:25:40,240
If you cleared it, the first direction you look is the dead end.

2660
03:25:40,240 --> 03:25:43,000
So you always need to look at the wrong way first.

2661
03:25:44,420 --> 03:25:45,660
Wait, since I'm... Wait.

2662
03:25:46,320 --> 03:25:48,300
The first direction you look is the dead end.

2663
03:25:53,890 --> 03:25:55,430
Oh, I get it.

2664
03:25:59,090 --> 03:26:00,010
That's why.

2665
03:26:04,450 --> 03:26:05,050
Thank you.

2666
03:26:06,190 --> 03:26:07,530
Yeah, you gotta make the exit.

2667
03:26:13,630 --> 03:26:16,870
Even with the help of triggering mechanisms.

2668
03:26:21,580 --> 03:26:22,550
I understand.

2669
03:26:24,470 --> 03:26:25,430
What did you say?

2670
03:26:32,060 --> 03:26:35,560
Guys, I messed up.

2671
03:26:41,060 --> 03:26:42,000
Wait.

2672
03:26:47,210 --> 03:26:48,300
I messed up.

2673
03:27:08,760 --> 03:27:11,340
Do I just have to make it again with my brain?

2674
03:27:13,560 --> 03:27:13,940
Back it up.

2675
03:27:14,020 --> 03:27:14,540
Back it up.

2676
03:27:14,620 --> 03:27:15,260
Back it up.

2677
03:27:15,380 --> 03:27:17,240
Back it up.

2678
03:27:17,580 --> 03:27:18,120
Back it up.

2679
03:27:18,440 --> 03:27:18,720
Back it up.

2680
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:19,660
Back it up.

2681
03:27:20,300 --> 03:27:20,880
Back it up.

2682
03:27:25,620 --> 03:27:26,520
Oh, it's gone.

2683
03:27:27,600 --> 03:27:28,040
No.

2684
03:27:37,100 --> 03:27:39,080
There's so much diet soda.

2685
03:27:40,380 --> 03:27:43,000
Thank god the vending machines have other options.

2686
03:27:44,240 --> 03:27:45,880
Am I overthinking it?

2687
03:27:45,920 --> 03:27:46,360
I am.

2688
03:27:48,260 --> 03:27:49,220
In what way?

2689
03:27:53,190 --> 03:27:55,050
This game constantly changes the rules on you.

2690
03:27:55,110 --> 03:27:58,230
Well, it changes the rules at the very end of the game.

2691
03:27:58,370 --> 03:27:59,730
I'm assuming this is the end of the game.

2692
03:28:05,800 --> 03:28:06,960
It's right there.

2693
03:28:07,300 --> 03:28:07,780
Haunts?

2694
03:28:08,280 --> 03:28:08,420
What?

2695
03:28:12,370 --> 03:28:13,170
A horse?

2696
03:28:17,020 --> 03:28:18,120
What are you talking about?

2697
03:28:23,210 --> 03:28:23,690
Horse?

2698
03:28:26,210 --> 03:28:27,350
Other side of the room?

2699
03:28:27,970 --> 03:28:29,050
Was there something there?

2700
03:28:35,500 --> 03:28:36,720
Maybe I am blind.

2701
03:28:36,840 --> 03:28:37,500
Thank you guys.

2702
03:28:38,860 --> 03:28:40,160
Maybe I am blind.

2703
03:28:40,620 --> 03:28:41,120
Oh my goodness.

2704
03:28:41,240 --> 03:28:42,380
I really was overthinking that.

2705
03:28:43,660 --> 03:28:44,620
Be careful.

2706
03:28:44,880 --> 03:28:45,420
Be careful.

2707
03:28:46,120 --> 03:28:46,980
Alright, go.

2708
03:28:50,060 --> 03:28:51,380
Could I have landed over there?

2709
03:28:51,460 --> 03:28:51,780
I wonder.

2710
03:28:56,520 --> 03:28:58,420
I need thicker glasses.

2711
03:28:58,620 --> 03:29:01,360
I'm also just kind of exhausted.

2712
03:29:05,680 --> 03:29:07,540
What is that?

2713
03:29:08,020 --> 03:29:08,580
A rock.

2714
03:29:11,160 --> 03:29:12,620
Not the rock.

2715
03:29:14,560 --> 03:29:15,700
It's been a long day.

2716
03:29:23,030 --> 03:29:24,270
Where are we?

2717
03:29:24,350 --> 03:29:25,350
Oh no, it's this again.

2718
03:29:26,350 --> 03:29:27,550
Oh no, it's this again.

2719
03:29:28,470 --> 03:29:32,190
Wait, but I can do it properly this time?

2720
03:29:32,490 --> 03:29:32,750
Maybe?

2721
03:29:34,730 --> 03:29:35,910
It's a nice bed.

2722
03:29:36,490 --> 03:29:36,870
Nevermind.

2723
03:29:37,250 --> 03:29:37,370
Wait.

2724
03:29:44,580 --> 03:29:45,740
Wow, gothic.

2725
03:29:48,340 --> 03:29:48,900
OK.

2726
03:29:49,900 --> 03:29:51,360
Normal door.

2727
03:29:57,500 --> 03:30:02,740
Oh my god.

2728
03:30:03,220 --> 03:30:04,200
Wait, we are back here.

2729
03:30:06,560 --> 03:30:07,180
Wake up!

2730
03:30:07,380 --> 03:30:07,620
Wake up!

2731
03:30:08,360 --> 03:30:09,120
Wake up!

2732
03:30:11,540 --> 03:30:14,380
Perception is a reality.

2733
03:30:14,380 --> 03:30:16,340
Wait, but there was another door.

2734
03:30:49,220 --> 03:30:50,260
I'm zooming.

2735
03:30:57,170 --> 03:31:00,790
It's like, hey buddy, you are going the wrong way.

2736
03:31:05,280 --> 03:31:06,040
OK.

2737
03:31:07,680 --> 03:31:08,440
Forward.

2738
03:31:10,480 --> 03:31:11,240
Right.

2739
03:31:25,980 --> 03:31:26,740
Straight.

2740
03:31:32,410 --> 03:31:33,170
Right.

2741
03:31:36,650 --> 03:31:37,390
We are zooming.

2742
03:31:40,110 --> 03:31:47,910
Please listen carefully for the sound of an alarm clock, which will automatically play if you are approaching a destabilizing dreamweight.

2743
03:31:49,190 --> 03:31:50,170
Is that good?

2744
03:31:51,930 --> 03:31:53,010
What's over here?

2745
03:31:54,070 --> 03:31:55,310
Mysterious light source?

2746
03:31:55,530 --> 03:31:56,390
How funny.

2747
03:31:59,130 --> 03:32:00,790
Yeah, that part was easy.

2748
03:32:00,910 --> 03:32:02,170
It was once I found the arrow.

2749
03:32:05,910 --> 03:32:07,670
The mysterious light source!

2750
03:32:07,670 --> 03:32:09,290
Was that an elevator?

2751
03:32:11,890 --> 03:32:12,590
Staircon!

2752
03:32:21,560 --> 03:32:23,670
Where is my car?

2753
03:32:29,780 --> 03:32:31,380
Oh my god, it's a wall.

2754
03:32:38,790 --> 03:32:40,490
Look at it bending.

2755
03:32:42,470 --> 03:32:44,470
Oh this one too!

2756
03:32:46,550 --> 03:32:48,250
I'm just going to follow the wall.

2757
03:32:48,250 --> 03:32:49,370
Truman Show.

2758
03:32:49,510 --> 03:32:51,210
Honestly, a Truman Show moment.

2759
03:32:53,150 --> 03:32:54,570
Let's hug the wall here.

2760
03:32:54,690 --> 03:32:55,450
Let's hug the wall.

2761
03:33:07,170 --> 03:33:08,990
These don't line up.

2762
03:33:09,170 --> 03:33:10,070
It looks horrible.

2763
03:33:31,540 --> 03:33:32,600
It's our bedroom.

2764
03:33:33,620 --> 03:33:35,340
Just making sure there is nothing around here.

2765
03:33:35,440 --> 03:33:35,620
Click.

2766
03:33:44,240 --> 03:33:46,600
This is so Outer Wilds.

2767
03:33:46,600 --> 03:33:48,360
Wait, it's a normal loading!

2768
03:33:55,520 --> 03:33:55,860
Hello?

2769
03:34:09,740 --> 03:34:10,940
Exciting?

2770
03:34:11,200 --> 03:34:11,800
Excitable?

2771
03:34:12,800 --> 03:34:13,460
Interesting?

2772
03:34:13,460 --> 03:34:13,580
Interesting?

2773
03:34:16,620 --> 03:34:21,020
What do fries do when they haven't met in a while?

2774
03:34:21,520 --> 03:34:23,280
They catch up!

2775
03:34:25,000 --> 03:34:27,500
That was cringe, I liked it.

2776
03:34:36,740 --> 03:34:37,340
Hello?

2777
03:34:39,040 --> 03:34:39,380
Hello?

2778
03:34:44,100 --> 03:34:44,880
Did you guys hear that?

2779
03:34:45,100 --> 03:34:47,000
There is a party going on behind here.

2780
03:34:47,960 --> 03:34:50,580
I don't like the... what's it called?

2781
03:34:50,700 --> 03:34:52,220
The little effect on the sides.

2782
03:34:54,260 --> 03:34:55,360
I don't like that.

2783
03:35:02,280 --> 03:35:03,540
There is another dance.

2784
03:35:04,480 --> 03:35:06,400
There is other music.

2785
03:35:07,860 --> 03:35:10,440
I'm trying to figure out what I can interact with.

2786
03:35:10,560 --> 03:35:11,360
What I can do.

2787
03:35:13,040 --> 03:35:16,120
L Oh wait, here!

2788
03:35:17,980 --> 03:35:18,780
What the?

2789
03:35:23,460 --> 03:35:27,700
I think I maybe figured it out.

2790
03:35:29,560 --> 03:35:30,300
Woah!

2791
03:35:47,420 --> 03:35:49,160
It's fine.

2792
03:35:50,660 --> 03:35:53,180
Oh wait, I made it too small.

2793
03:35:54,180 --> 03:35:56,120
Is that big enough?

2794
03:35:57,900 --> 03:35:59,060
So close.

2795
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:05,040
Ok, hold on.

2796
03:36:05,920 --> 03:36:08,460
If you're going to say goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.

2797
03:36:08,580 --> 03:36:09,420
Thanks for hanging out.

2798
03:36:11,660 --> 03:36:12,300
No!

2799
03:36:13,680 --> 03:36:15,300
Is this big enough?

2800
03:36:16,240 --> 03:36:16,680
Yeah.

2801
03:36:17,420 --> 03:36:18,500
Let's go baby.

2802
03:36:18,840 --> 03:36:19,640
Wait a second.

2803
03:36:22,120 --> 03:36:23,560
Hold your horses.

2804
03:36:25,900 --> 03:36:26,760
Now...

2805
03:36:30,080 --> 03:36:35,880
But then if I go in here...

2806
03:36:41,060 --> 03:36:42,320
Oh, it's open now.

2807
03:36:43,220 --> 03:36:43,560
Forever?

2808
03:36:49,080 --> 03:36:50,580
Another graduation.

2809
03:36:50,860 --> 03:36:52,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

2810
03:36:55,440 --> 03:36:57,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2811
03:37:00,380 --> 03:37:05,960
Yeah, I saw the waiting room too, but I did not know what it was.

2812
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:10,080
Yeah, don't get too small.

2813
03:37:10,160 --> 03:37:11,660
I know, I'm going back through, I'm going back through.

2814
03:37:17,260 --> 03:37:18,820
We're going to get to normal height.

2815
03:37:19,500 --> 03:37:19,900
Ok.

2816
03:37:21,080 --> 03:37:21,380
Alright.

2817
03:37:24,980 --> 03:37:27,780
Do I need to like, see myself?

2818
03:37:33,420 --> 03:37:34,520
But that's impossible.

2819
03:37:34,580 --> 03:37:35,220
There is no way.

2820
03:37:35,800 --> 03:37:36,420
You could.

2821
03:37:37,320 --> 03:37:38,320
There is no way to.

2822
03:37:54,370 --> 03:37:55,650
I'm trying to make it big.

2823
03:37:57,190 --> 03:37:57,630
No!

2824
03:37:57,770 --> 03:37:58,790
Stop please!

2825
03:38:07,590 --> 03:38:09,890
Why can't I make it go so far back in the room?

2826
03:38:18,060 --> 03:38:19,100
Diagnostic warning.

2827
03:38:19,420 --> 03:38:22,920
Paradox prevention protocols may not be fully implemented.

2828
03:38:25,180 --> 03:38:27,300
Do I just keep breaking it?

2829
03:38:30,640 --> 03:38:32,840
I see some people bringing up the rules.

2830
03:38:33,840 --> 03:38:35,480
I appreciate it.

2831
03:38:35,640 --> 03:38:37,560
You know, obviously...

2832
03:38:37,560 --> 03:38:40,860
Try to follow rules guys.

2833
03:38:40,860 --> 03:38:45,860
I know in situations like this it's awkward to say, but yeah.

2834
03:38:54,480 --> 03:38:56,660
I'm trying to figure out a puzzle.

2835
03:39:05,180 --> 03:39:08,960
Can I bring it in here and smash this building instead?

2836
03:39:12,000 --> 03:39:12,860
Oh wait!

2837
03:39:13,740 --> 03:39:17,120
Oh wait!

2838
03:39:20,960 --> 03:39:22,280
Oh no,

2839
03:39:30,740 --> 03:39:31,420
I'm getting too small.

2840
03:39:34,200 --> 03:39:35,900
I'm getting too small!

2841
03:39:36,280 --> 03:39:37,540
I'm too slow!

2842
03:39:37,900 --> 03:39:39,100
Diagnostic warning.

2843
03:39:39,380 --> 03:39:42,880
Paradox prevention protocols may not be fully implemented.

2844
03:39:47,300 --> 03:39:50,600
Guys, I think I'm starting to literally lose brain cells.

2845
03:39:50,760 --> 03:39:52,780
I can't figure out any of these puzzles anymore.

2846
03:39:55,780 --> 03:39:57,160
I'm so tired!

2847
03:39:57,520 --> 03:39:59,220
Oh my gosh, you can see it right there.

2848
03:39:59,280 --> 03:39:59,800
Look at that.

2849
03:40:03,500 --> 03:40:04,940
Where does that go to?

2850
03:40:05,720 --> 03:40:07,440
Guys, I think I messed up.

2851
03:40:13,320 --> 03:40:14,880
Guys, I think I messed up.

2852
03:40:19,950 --> 03:40:21,090
Guys, I think I messed up!

2853
03:40:24,620 --> 03:40:25,180
We're free!

2854
03:40:29,180 --> 03:40:31,080
Wait a second, I need to go this way.

2855
03:40:31,440 --> 03:40:32,940
Wait, how do I...yeah, I need to get bigger.

2856
03:40:34,340 --> 03:40:34,560
No!

2857
03:40:50,310 --> 03:40:52,070
I'm so close to what you need to do.

2858
03:40:52,070 --> 03:40:52,890
I am.

2859
03:40:57,990 --> 03:40:59,090
Diagnostic warning.

2860
03:40:59,410 --> 03:41:02,890
Paradox prevention protocols may not be fully implemented.

2861
03:41:04,390 --> 03:41:06,110
Yeah we get it.

2862
03:41:06,270 --> 03:41:07,010
GLADOS.

2863
03:41:07,210 --> 03:41:07,950
Oh my gosh.

2864
03:41:09,330 --> 03:41:12,390
Is there something I need to get inside?

2865
03:41:12,990 --> 03:41:13,810
Maybe here?

2866
03:41:18,320 --> 03:41:20,560
Is this supposed to happen?

2867
03:41:29,150 --> 03:41:29,630
Is...

2868
03:41:29,630 --> 03:41:30,430
What?

2869
03:41:33,850 --> 03:41:34,330
No?

2870
03:41:34,490 --> 03:41:35,110
Oh it's a glitch.

2871
03:41:35,250 --> 03:41:35,470
OK.

2872
03:41:36,570 --> 03:41:38,450
You can't tell with these types of games.

2873
03:41:41,010 --> 03:41:42,410
You can't tell.

2874
03:41:43,870 --> 03:41:45,110
Maybe I need to read this.

2875
03:41:45,110 --> 03:41:48,730
A reminder called Jungle's Management.

2876
03:41:48,850 --> 03:41:49,930
Music too dang loud.

2877
03:41:50,050 --> 03:41:51,230
Scent of burned curry.

2878
03:41:51,830 --> 03:41:52,810
Yummy curry.

2879
03:41:53,410 --> 03:41:55,010
Shipments of food coming here.

2880
03:41:55,110 --> 03:41:56,410
Don't have space for more.

2881
03:41:56,870 --> 03:41:58,890
Ask if they can hand out flyers for testing.

2882
03:42:00,570 --> 03:42:05,150
Also ask RySan Medical for increased canister order frequency.

2883
03:42:07,130 --> 03:42:08,830
Paradox behavior 101.

2884
03:42:09,010 --> 03:42:10,690
AKA don't do it never.

2885
03:42:17,250 --> 03:42:18,010
Hmm...

2886
03:42:18,010 --> 03:42:19,130
Diagnostic warning.

2887

Paradox prevention protocols may not be fully implemented.

2888
03:42:29,210 --> 03:42:29,970
Never...

2889
03:42:33,810 --> 03:42:35,970
I think I figured it out!

2890
03:42:38,910 --> 03:42:40,510
I think I figured it out!

2891
03:42:43,910 --> 03:42:44,630
Oh!

2892
03:42:51,050 --> 03:42:51,770
Oopsie!

2893
03:42:54,070 --> 03:42:56,910
Why do I have to be so stinking small though?

2894
03:42:59,850 --> 03:43:00,870
I did it!

2895
03:43:01,230 --> 03:43:03,630
I just grabbed it and took it in.

2896
03:43:05,170 --> 03:43:06,010
Yeah!

2897
03:43:12,190 --> 03:43:13,990
What are you?

2898
03:43:23,630 --> 03:43:25,230
Not an exit.

2899
03:43:26,010 --> 03:43:29,510
I don't think we are going to find an exit anymore because you are small.

2900
03:43:31,990 --> 03:43:33,470
Here we go.

2901
03:43:35,150 --> 03:43:35,990
Windows.

2902
03:43:38,250 --> 03:43:39,510
Exclamation point.

2903
03:43:46,560 --> 03:43:47,000
Oh!

2904
03:43:48,780 --> 03:43:50,680
This liminal is super.

2905
03:43:51,200 --> 03:43:53,040
Like it was just made.

2906
03:43:53,860 --> 03:43:54,420
Wow!

2907
03:43:54,780 --> 03:43:56,060
Everything is black and white.

2908
03:44:05,820 --> 03:44:06,540
Doctor!

2909
03:44:06,680 --> 03:44:06,920
Doctor!

2910
03:44:26,460 --> 03:44:27,780
Deception?

2911
03:44:32,460 --> 03:44:36,140
Instead of reception it's deception?

2912
03:44:40,460 --> 03:44:44,760
Man, even the vending machines in this world suck.

2913
03:44:47,380 --> 03:44:48,700
Deception...

2914
03:44:50,580 --> 03:44:51,900
Disgrace...

2915
03:44:53,840 --> 03:44:56,140
They lie into us.

2916
03:45:01,240 --> 03:45:03,160
This is like super liminal.

2917
03:45:03,620 --> 03:45:04,940
Wait a minute!

2918
03:45:07,100 --> 03:45:08,320
Oh my gosh!

2919
03:45:10,540 --> 03:45:11,820
Holy loud!

2920
03:45:18,580 --> 03:45:22,280
Oracle of Nintendo Direct, what are they going to announce next?

2921
03:45:29,080 --> 03:45:29,840
I don't know.

2922
03:45:30,280 --> 03:45:31,780
There is too much pressure.

2923
03:45:32,160 --> 03:45:33,260
Erase me.

2924
03:45:35,960 --> 03:45:36,600
Relaxia.

2925
03:45:39,080 --> 03:45:39,720
Minerals.

2926
03:45:40,860 --> 03:45:42,140
Female toads.

2927
03:45:42,580 --> 03:45:43,660
You had me at female.

2928
03:45:49,590 --> 03:45:52,270
Guys, are we ever going to see the light of day again?

2929
03:45:53,850 --> 03:45:54,990
Not an exit.

2930
03:45:55,550 --> 03:45:57,590
Everything is so gloomy inside now.

2931
03:45:58,490 --> 03:45:59,550
Is this a door?

2932
03:46:00,790 --> 03:46:02,470
Oh yes it is.

2933
03:46:04,310 --> 03:46:05,670
There we go.

2934
03:46:07,390 --> 03:46:08,350
What is your wisdom?

2935
03:46:14,090 --> 03:46:17,270
No Nihongo before 8 AM.

2936
03:46:28,930 --> 03:46:30,030
I'm almost there.

2937
03:46:30,610 --> 03:46:31,530
I'm going to touch it.

2938
03:46:32,090 --> 03:46:32,590
Wait, wait, wait.

2939
03:46:32,610 --> 03:46:33,310
It's so high up.

2940
03:46:33,950 --> 03:46:35,190
No, it's too high up for me.

2941
03:46:35,190 --> 03:46:40,610
No it's not.

2942
03:46:41,650 --> 03:46:44,530
This is my world.

2943
03:46:48,930 --> 03:46:54,190
But in white space, I also faced the greatest challenge I could imagine.

2944
03:46:55,290 --> 03:47:07,130
Because with a lifetime of life itself behind me, and all of the weight that it carried, I realized that seeing things the way I wanted to was not as easy as it used to be.

2945
03:47:09,070 --> 03:47:11,190
Mister, I'm confused.

2946
03:47:13,530 --> 03:47:15,430
What's going on?

2947
03:47:16,250 --> 03:47:18,570
I'm so confused.

2948
03:47:22,690 --> 03:47:24,770
Majin D, thank you so much for the gift.

2949
03:47:25,350 --> 03:47:26,510
Thank you.

2950
03:47:27,830 --> 03:47:28,950
You should be.

2951
03:47:30,170 --> 03:47:35,030
Wait, hold on before we do something that seems so final as turning off the lights.

2952
03:47:36,130 --> 03:47:39,850
I would like to take a look around at our statue.

2953
03:47:44,590 --> 03:47:45,630
Oh wait.

2954
03:47:46,890 --> 03:47:47,950
I can get on.

2955
03:47:48,490 --> 03:47:49,010
Nice.

2956
03:47:49,510 --> 03:47:50,210
I can get up.

2957
03:47:50,590 --> 03:47:51,490
I can climb everything.

2958
03:47:53,010 --> 03:47:55,910
There is no mountain that I can't climb.

2959
03:47:55,910 --> 03:47:56,030
Climb.

2960
03:48:13,340 --> 03:48:16,980
Ain't no mountain high enough.

2961
03:48:17,100 --> 03:48:17,940
Oh, there we go.

2962
03:48:20,180 --> 03:48:22,520
Find the game save.

2963
03:48:26,680 --> 03:48:27,780
This is a...

2964
03:48:31,140 --> 03:48:31,780
Wow.

2965
03:48:38,220 --> 03:48:39,540
That's... You see this?

2966
03:48:40,460 --> 03:48:41,980
See how that disappears?

2967
03:48:42,580 --> 03:48:46,020
That's like looking at a VTuber sideways.

2968
03:48:49,100 --> 03:48:52,360
If you were to look at me sideways, that's exactly how I would be.

2969
03:49:00,580 --> 03:49:03,420
Do we take the red and the blue door?

2970
03:49:03,600 --> 03:49:05,880
Or do we take the red and the yellow door?

2971
03:49:08,280 --> 03:49:09,480
So skinny.

2972
03:49:11,980 --> 03:49:13,100
Yeah, sorry.

2973
03:49:18,560 --> 03:49:20,160
Why not both?

2974
03:49:20,640 --> 03:49:21,720
OK, we'll go through this.

2975
03:49:23,600 --> 03:49:24,200
One.

2976
03:49:26,360 --> 03:49:27,740
OK, what do we do?

2977
03:49:28,260 --> 03:49:29,520
What do we do here?

2978
03:49:31,340 --> 03:49:37,040
Were you super smart and figured everything out on your own and didn't use chat's help because you were a super big brain ghost?

2979
03:49:37,920 --> 03:49:38,360
Yeah.

2980
03:49:40,760 --> 03:49:41,280
Yeah.

2981
03:49:44,040 --> 03:49:44,560
Yeah.

2982
03:49:50,050 --> 03:49:51,710
I was pretty smart.

2983
03:49:53,010 --> 03:49:53,910
Right guys?

2984
03:49:58,510 --> 03:50:01,890
I did a lot of things on my own with little hints.

2985
03:50:01,890 --> 03:50:02,130
Yes.

2986
03:50:06,510 --> 03:50:06,810
Yeah.

2987
03:50:12,770 --> 03:50:13,370
Yeah.

2988
03:50:14,050 --> 03:50:14,510
Genius.

2989
03:50:15,410 --> 03:50:15,990
Yeah.

2990
03:50:16,810 --> 03:50:17,410
Yeah.

2991
03:50:18,390 --> 03:50:20,070
OK, this part though, I'm confused.

2992
03:50:37,510 --> 03:50:39,230
Show us your genius.

2993
03:50:39,370 --> 03:50:40,610
That's like so sensitive.

2994
03:50:46,260 --> 03:50:47,780
Wait, which way did I come from?

2995
03:50:53,710 --> 03:50:56,970
Wait, if I try going backwards, does it do anything?

2996
03:51:06,840 --> 03:51:08,920
I'm going the opposite direction now.

2997
03:51:10,800 --> 03:51:11,740
I think.

2998
03:51:21,780 --> 03:51:22,940
Ah.

2999
03:51:45,560 --> 03:51:48,740
Does the red have...

3000
03:51:49,620 --> 03:51:51,280
Stare into the void?

3001
03:51:52,880 --> 03:51:54,780
Stare into the void?

3002
03:51:58,540 --> 03:52:01,460
I don't see green.

3003
03:52:04,720 --> 03:52:06,500
Remember the gimmick of the stage?

3004
03:52:06,620 --> 03:52:07,780
Wait, what was the stage?

3005
03:52:07,840 --> 03:52:09,600
I don't remember the stage at all actually.

3006
03:52:11,000 --> 03:52:12,320
What was the stage?

3007
03:52:22,750 --> 03:52:23,570
Black and white?

3008
03:52:30,500 --> 03:52:32,040
I'm actually so confused.

3009
03:52:33,880 --> 03:52:34,440
Guys?

3010
03:52:35,900 --> 03:52:37,560
I'm actually so confused.

3011
03:52:42,900 --> 03:52:43,700
Hold on.

3012
03:52:55,020 --> 03:52:56,100
Hold on.

3013
03:53:05,100 --> 03:53:06,640
Abandon your concepts.

3014
03:53:07,140 --> 03:53:08,680
You were really close.

3015
03:53:08,940 --> 03:53:09,560
Wait, I was?

3016
03:53:09,620 --> 03:53:13,440
I don't know at what point I was close, but...

3017
03:53:13,440 --> 03:53:14,280
I believe you.

3018
03:53:25,940 --> 03:53:27,260
My brain hurts.

3019
03:53:33,810 --> 03:53:35,110
The box.

3020
03:53:35,130 --> 03:53:35,810
This one.

3021
03:53:36,310 --> 03:53:36,930
I'm here.

3022
03:53:50,110 --> 03:53:52,270
Stop thinking logic.

3023
03:53:56,050 --> 03:53:57,470
Become color!

3024
03:53:58,290 --> 03:53:59,490
I become color!

3025
03:54:10,620 --> 03:54:12,140
I'm so angry.

3026
03:54:22,140 --> 03:54:31,300
After all, if this is a place of pure perspective, isn't it also a place where a different point of view could make anything possible?

3027
03:54:32,260 --> 03:54:34,040
Isn't that why you came here?

3028
03:54:34,160 --> 03:54:35,360
I don't know why I'm here.

3029
03:54:35,460 --> 03:54:38,640
Why are there dumpsters in this pristine city?

3030
03:54:40,580 --> 03:54:41,980
Why are there dumpsters here?

3031
03:54:54,320 --> 03:54:55,980
There are so many doors.

3032
03:54:56,180 --> 03:54:58,440
Oh my gosh, look at all the water coolers.

3033
03:55:04,040 --> 03:55:04,520
Checkmate.

3034
03:55:09,440 --> 03:55:11,160
And my queen.

3035
03:55:12,980 --> 03:55:13,940
Very small.

3036
03:55:18,110 --> 03:55:21,750
Wait a second, that door is not going to get any closer.

3037
03:55:21,750 --> 03:55:22,830
Where is it?

3038
03:55:25,670 --> 03:55:26,610
Oh my gosh.

3039
03:55:27,210 --> 03:55:29,130
That was just... Wait, where did that go?

3040
03:55:29,450 --> 03:55:30,890
It landed on my head.

3041
03:55:36,060 --> 03:55:36,800
Wait a second.

3042
03:55:40,520 --> 03:55:42,960
Wait, so I can't go in the white or the black?

3043
03:55:46,220 --> 03:55:49,600
I think if I put something there...

3044
03:55:51,580 --> 03:55:53,300
It becomes solid.

3045
03:56:01,160 --> 03:56:01,940
Oopsie.

3046
03:56:09,730 --> 03:56:11,810
Is that good enough?

3047
03:56:13,170 --> 03:56:13,430
Yeah.

3048
03:56:22,600 --> 03:56:24,220
I almost did it again.

3049
03:56:24,820 --> 03:56:26,360
I almost did it again.

3050
03:56:28,980 --> 03:56:29,700
Checkmate.

3051
03:56:32,400 --> 03:56:34,460
Do I need it here too?

3052
03:56:34,880 --> 03:56:35,640
Just in case.

3053
03:56:37,740 --> 03:56:38,460
Nice.

3054
03:56:39,100 --> 03:56:40,940
She's going to sacrifice herself.

3055
03:56:44,180 --> 03:56:49,640
We can go through this door.

3056
03:56:50,580 --> 03:56:51,800
It's not a door.

3057
03:56:53,020 --> 03:56:55,200
Or we can go through the other door.

3058
03:56:59,180 --> 03:57:00,960
Wait, how would I even get up there?

3059
03:57:02,060 --> 03:57:02,300
Wait.

3060
03:57:04,180 --> 03:57:05,800
Wait, I made it.

3061
03:57:06,660 --> 03:57:11,000
Wait, how did I... I think it shrunk, no?

3062
03:57:19,560 --> 03:57:21,240
Or is it just...

3063
03:57:23,840 --> 03:57:24,400
No.

3064
03:57:27,580 --> 03:57:29,160
Forget about the doors.

3065
03:57:29,320 --> 03:57:30,740
Yeah, screw the doors.

3066
03:57:31,820 --> 03:57:33,140
Screw the doors.

3067
03:57:33,140 --> 03:57:36,180
I have to go through that door.

3068
03:57:40,760 --> 03:57:44,200
This is a closed box everybody.

3069
03:57:45,040 --> 03:57:46,760
It's an actual box this time.

3070
03:57:49,140 --> 03:57:51,160
Don't limit yourself they said.

3071
03:57:51,440 --> 03:57:53,060
Think outside the box they said.

3072
03:57:54,360 --> 03:57:56,280
Why would you put me in this box?

3073
03:57:57,240 --> 03:57:58,280
Are you sure?

3074
03:57:58,280 --> 03:57:58,400
Sure.

3075
03:58:06,000 --> 03:58:07,880
Be the box.

3076
03:58:08,200 --> 03:58:10,080
I am the box.

3077
03:58:17,010 --> 03:58:19,870
Sorry, my eyes are starting to hurt me.

3078
03:58:26,380 --> 03:58:27,020
Wait.

3079
03:58:28,460 --> 03:58:30,320
I was going to grab it, but I don't think I can.

3080
03:58:30,520 --> 03:58:33,800
Can I grab this door?

3081
03:58:36,640 --> 03:58:37,560
One second.

3082
03:58:49,430 --> 03:58:49,650
Oh.

3083
03:58:51,270 --> 03:58:52,090
Wait, what?

3084
03:58:53,130 --> 03:58:54,270
Oh, okay.

3085
03:58:54,490 --> 03:58:55,490
Sorry, I got a...

3086
03:58:56,430 --> 03:58:59,830
Sorry, I got a text and it scared me.

3087
03:59:01,070 --> 03:59:03,370
So I was scared, but I'm okay.

3088
03:59:04,630 --> 03:59:05,430
Okay, nevermind.

3089
03:59:11,740 --> 03:59:12,340
Words.

3090
03:59:14,200 --> 03:59:15,440
Yeah, everything is okay though.

3091
03:59:18,940 --> 03:59:20,680
Anyway, what was I doing?

3092
03:59:30,360 --> 03:59:31,680
Please come here.

3093
03:59:31,900 --> 03:59:32,760
What if I ask...

3094
03:59:33,520 --> 03:59:34,860
Really nicely.

3095
03:59:36,020 --> 03:59:37,560
I say, please.

3096
03:59:42,680 --> 03:59:44,340
Please go inside!

3097
03:59:47,660 --> 03:59:49,040
Shove it in there.

3098
03:59:49,960 --> 03:59:51,340
Stick it in.

3099
03:59:56,300 --> 03:59:57,800
It's too big.

3100
03:59:58,860 --> 03:59:59,420
It opened.

3101
04:00:00,520 --> 04:00:01,680
It opened though.

3102
04:00:05,020 --> 04:00:05,960
Oh, dang it.

3103
04:00:06,080 --> 04:00:06,560
It closed.

3104
04:00:07,360 --> 04:00:08,720
I don't think it was ever really open.

3105
04:00:14,940 --> 04:00:15,440
What?

3106
04:00:15,680 --> 04:00:17,000
Why is it become...

3107
04:00:17,530 --> 04:00:20,020
Can you put it in the other door?

3108
04:00:20,160 --> 04:00:21,640
I think I tried and it didn't work.

3109
04:00:22,900 --> 04:00:23,080
Oh.

3110
04:00:23,460 --> 04:00:24,840
Are you kidding me?

3111
04:00:25,500 --> 04:00:27,420
I thought I tried!

3112
04:00:39,400 --> 04:00:41,960
It's always the back to cheese.

3113
04:00:42,500 --> 04:00:44,300
I still need to make it bigger though.

3114
04:00:45,080 --> 04:00:45,700
I'm bigger!

3115
04:00:46,040 --> 04:00:46,400
Bigger!

3116
04:00:48,800 --> 04:00:49,440
Bigger!

3117
04:00:49,580 --> 04:00:49,880
Bigger!

3118
04:00:53,700 --> 04:00:55,380
White background is tricky.

3119
04:00:56,100 --> 04:00:57,680
It hurts my eyes so much.

3120
04:00:58,320 --> 04:00:59,260
Let's try the cheese.

3121
04:01:00,440 --> 04:01:01,320
Giant cheese.

3122
04:01:02,520 --> 04:01:03,640
Holy cow!

3123
04:01:04,400 --> 04:01:07,040
I don't know why I can get the cheese so big.

3124
04:01:07,040 --> 04:01:08,740
But nothing else.

3125
04:01:12,040 --> 04:01:13,580
Come on cheese.

3126
04:01:14,100 --> 04:01:14,980
Come on cheese.

3127
04:01:15,440 --> 04:01:16,320
Giant cheese.

3128
04:01:17,280 --> 04:01:17,500
OK.

3129
04:01:18,040 --> 04:01:18,660
There we go.

3130
04:01:20,360 --> 04:01:20,920
Mickey!

3131
04:01:21,440 --> 04:01:22,240
That's me!

3132
04:01:24,880 --> 04:01:26,180
Thanks for the super chat.

3133
04:01:32,500 --> 04:01:34,520
This is bad apple.

3134
04:01:36,960 --> 04:01:38,240
Oh wow.

3135
04:01:52,580 --> 04:01:53,220
No?

3136
04:01:57,460 --> 04:01:57,660
OK.

3137
04:02:00,500 --> 04:02:02,340
This is the motion sickness thing.

3138
04:02:04,120 --> 04:02:05,760
I think I'm mostly OK.

3139
04:02:06,840 --> 04:02:07,500
Do I just keep going?

3140
04:02:10,340 --> 04:02:12,560
I thought it was a special trick.

3141
04:02:14,240 --> 04:02:17,360
I see what you mean!

3142
04:02:40,470 --> 04:02:43,510
There we go.

3143
04:02:44,470 --> 04:02:45,250
Into the void.

3144
04:02:56,650 --> 04:02:58,290
It doesn't have it in there.

3145
04:02:59,730 --> 04:03:00,390
Exit!

3146
04:03:00,790 --> 04:03:02,430
There is the alarm!

3147
04:03:07,080 --> 04:03:08,260
What does it say?

3148
04:03:10,600 --> 04:03:12,520
7.59 AM!

3149
04:03:16,080 --> 04:03:18,260
Wait, did YouTube break as I...

3150
04:03:20,300 --> 04:03:22,980
Did YouTube break when I jumped in?

3151
04:03:23,060 --> 04:03:23,600
That's so funny.

3152
04:03:34,340 --> 04:03:35,460
8 AM.

3153
04:03:37,700 --> 04:03:38,920
Oh my god, still?

3154
04:03:44,520 --> 04:03:45,980
They should hire me.

3155
04:03:46,140 --> 04:03:46,660
For real.

3156
04:03:47,640 --> 04:03:48,380
This place.

3157
04:03:51,860 --> 04:03:52,840
What's that sound?

3158
04:04:08,180 --> 04:04:11,360
So you just made all this up so I would feel special?

3159
04:04:12,880 --> 04:04:17,740
You made all this up so I would feel like I was a special, unique individual?

3160
04:04:26,480 --> 04:04:26,920
No!

3161
04:04:31,220 --> 04:04:32,960
He's just trying to avoid a loss.

3162
04:04:37,780 --> 04:04:38,340
Hello!

3163
04:04:40,540 --> 04:04:41,700
I want to play B-Ball.

3164
04:04:42,780 --> 04:04:43,820
He's just gaslighting.

3165
04:04:43,880 --> 04:04:44,360
For real!

3166
04:04:46,180 --> 04:04:46,980
I was here.

3167
04:04:48,780 --> 04:04:50,040
Send me to the next place.

3168
04:04:59,980 --> 04:05:01,460
It's marked off!

3169
04:05:01,460 --> 04:05:02,160
No!

3170
04:05:06,300 --> 04:05:06,780
We

3171
04:05:11,220 --> 04:05:13,680
are going through all the places we went through!

3172
04:05:16,040 --> 04:05:18,340
I didn't think I would beat this today, I'll be honest.

3173
04:05:32,740 --> 04:05:33,700
I did!

3174
04:05:36,900 --> 04:05:39,280
And then also my chat helped me.

3175
04:05:54,660 --> 04:05:56,720
They were like, let's forget about that part.

3176
04:05:57,760 --> 04:05:58,760
That part was spooky.

3177
04:06:00,760 --> 04:06:02,140
We did it!

3178
04:06:02,220 --> 04:06:02,980
We did it!

3179
04:06:02,980 --> 04:06:07,120
I was saying spooky and freaky and then I accidentally said spreeky.

3180
04:06:09,780 --> 04:06:11,120
Great stream man.

3181
04:06:11,180 --> 04:06:11,880
Thank you kitty!

3182
04:06:13,660 --> 04:06:15,160
I miss my kitty.

3183
04:06:15,740 --> 04:06:16,600
The dice!

3184
04:06:17,020 --> 04:06:18,080
Dream soda!

3185
04:06:18,380 --> 04:06:18,840
Dream soda!

3186
04:06:39,120 --> 04:06:39,560
Spreeky!

3187
04:06:56,800 --> 04:06:57,400
Wake up!

3188
04:06:57,520 --> 04:06:57,680
Wake up!

3189
04:06:57,700 --> 04:06:57,980
Wake up!

3190
04:06:58,020 --> 04:06:58,700
Wake up!

3191
04:06:59,100 --> 04:06:59,440
Wake up!

3192
04:06:59,440 --> 04:06:59,620
Wake up!

3193
04:07:01,180 --> 04:07:01,620
Wake up!

3194
04:07:01,620 --> 04:07:02,720
Wake up!

3195
04:07:09,050 --> 04:07:09,490
Yippee!

3196
04:07:09,610 --> 04:07:11,230
We did it!

3197
04:07:13,350 --> 04:07:16,010
Can't wake up Wake me up!

3198
04:07:16,470 --> 04:07:17,370
Wake up!

3199
04:07:17,690 --> 04:07:18,910
Thank you so much for the 20 gifts!

3200
04:07:19,050 --> 04:07:19,970
Thank you!

3201
04:07:23,630 --> 04:07:24,130
Yay!

3202
04:07:32,710 --> 04:07:34,170
Congratulations on finishing the game!

3203
04:07:34,390 --> 04:07:35,150
I can't believe it!

3204
04:07:35,190 --> 04:07:35,690
We did it!

3205
04:07:35,750 --> 04:07:36,210
One goal!

3206
04:07:36,390 --> 04:07:37,930
Thank you so much for the pink!

3207
04:07:38,870 --> 04:07:39,710
Good morning Mito!

3208
04:07:39,870 --> 04:07:42,070
Good morning Mito!

3209
04:07:42,350 --> 04:07:45,710
This is everything that happens in your head when I'm possessing you.

3210
04:07:48,550 --> 04:07:49,430
Manifold garden.

3211
04:07:49,510 --> 04:07:49,970
What's that?

3212
04:07:51,530 --> 04:07:55,270
The first time I beat it I teared up at the ending.

3213
04:07:57,230 --> 04:08:02,870
I don't know what it is about these types of games that just make you so...

3214
04:08:02,870 --> 04:08:03,950
I don't know.

3215
04:08:04,690 --> 04:08:05,990
They make you really think.

3216
04:08:06,370 --> 04:08:08,710
Not just because it's a puzzle game but also just like...

3217
04:08:10,630 --> 04:08:12,930
It's so Emo-y at the ending.

3218
04:08:13,290 --> 04:08:14,970
They always make it such an adventure.

3219
04:08:18,310 --> 04:08:21,230
They went to an institute to cure their crippling insomnia.

3220
04:08:23,390 --> 04:08:25,650
Wakes up, snooze alarm, goes back to sleep.

3221
04:08:26,750 --> 04:08:27,850
The glasses worked?

3222
04:08:42,430 --> 04:08:43,490
My glasses.

3223
04:08:44,870 --> 04:08:46,350
I told you I was smart.

3224
04:08:46,650 --> 04:08:46,990
I told you.

3225
04:08:51,250 --> 04:08:57,230
Sometimes some puzzles really get me though and some I can figure out so quickly.

3226
04:09:01,050 --> 04:09:01,650
Smart.

3227
04:09:05,370 --> 04:09:05,970
Salvi!

3228
04:09:06,310 --> 04:09:07,450
Thank you so much for the red!

3229
04:09:07,450 --> 04:09:07,450
Red!

3230
04:09:08,230 --> 04:09:10,630
I just finished the game.

3231
04:09:10,750 --> 04:09:11,810
Thank you.

3232
04:09:12,350 --> 04:09:13,930
You look good with glasses too.

3233
04:09:16,470 --> 04:09:17,330
Thank you.

3234
04:09:18,050 --> 04:09:20,010
Smart Minky, give me your wisdom.

3235
04:09:27,910 --> 04:09:28,890
Roll again.

3236
04:09:31,510 --> 04:09:33,050
Thanks for dreaming.

3237
04:09:34,750 --> 04:09:35,330
Oh wait.

3238
04:09:35,630 --> 04:09:35,930
Hold on.

3239
04:09:36,030 --> 04:09:36,350
I'm waiting.

3240
04:09:37,190 --> 04:09:38,150
My Goshi.

3241
04:09:39,250 --> 04:09:40,150
Thank you star.

3242
04:09:40,490 --> 04:09:43,810
If I click out of the game, you'll see it does like the...

3243
04:09:43,810 --> 04:09:45,070
Turbo lover, thank you for the 5 gifted.

3244
04:09:45,150 --> 04:09:46,490
Rayback, thank you for that gifted.

3245
04:09:47,350 --> 04:09:48,070
Thank you!

3246
04:09:49,990 --> 04:09:52,610
It stops the music so I didn't wanna...Oh there we go.

3247
04:10:00,520 --> 04:10:01,800
IWSFJ, thank you for the 10 gifted.

3248
04:10:01,880 --> 04:10:02,440
Thank you so much.

3249
04:10:02,520 --> 04:10:03,260
Thank you.

3250
04:10:05,480 --> 04:10:07,820
I'm gonna get the soundtrack for this game 100%.

3251
04:10:07,820 --> 04:10:09,040
They have it on Steam.

3252
04:10:09,580 --> 04:10:12,960
I got this game, I have Game Pass.

3253
04:10:13,340 --> 04:10:14,720
So it was free on Game Pass.

3254
04:10:16,080 --> 04:10:19,000
But the soundtrack I will 100% buy.

3255
04:10:20,360 --> 04:10:22,140
The view finder is bendy.

3256
04:10:23,660 --> 04:10:25,700
Catching a minstream in itself is like a dream.

3257
04:10:28,220 --> 04:10:29,980
Can't open or welcome to membership.

3258
04:10:30,920 --> 04:10:33,080
Just wanted to say I appreciate you a lot Minto.

3259
04:10:34,800 --> 04:10:35,840
My Goshi.

3260
04:11:12,950 --> 04:11:16,890
I don't feel like I have so much I could say.

3261
04:11:17,310 --> 04:11:19,110
Hasn't already been said before maybe.

3262
04:11:20,470 --> 04:11:22,510
And probably better by other people.

3263
04:11:25,710 --> 04:11:27,790
If you need a chuckle.

3264
04:11:28,430 --> 04:11:30,310
If you need a chuckle, I'm here.

3265
04:11:35,980 --> 04:11:37,240
This is fun though.

3266
04:11:37,620 --> 04:11:38,680
I really enjoyed this game.

3267
04:11:38,800 --> 04:11:39,840
I like puzzle games.

3268
04:11:40,500 --> 04:11:45,840
And this one, I felt, had just enough challenge and also...

3269
04:11:45,840 --> 04:11:50,880
Not making me want to tear my hair out.

3270
04:11:52,560 --> 04:11:53,840
So it's good.

3271
04:11:54,480 --> 04:11:56,380
Try Princess, thank you!

3272
04:12:00,880 --> 04:12:02,020
Is it so well?

3273
04:12:02,100 --> 04:12:02,920
Thank you!

3274
04:12:04,360 --> 04:12:05,480
Interesting game, indeed.

3275
04:12:05,520 --> 04:12:06,400
Makes me want to try.

3276
04:12:07,340 --> 04:12:10,920
I probably won't be doing the extra modes, but...

3277
04:12:12,720 --> 04:12:15,780
I had a dream I was Haley Steinfeld.

3278
04:12:15,860 --> 04:12:16,340
Who's that?

3279
04:12:17,100 --> 04:12:17,620
And fishing.

3280
04:12:18,060 --> 04:12:19,300
I wish I was fishing.

3281
04:12:20,800 --> 04:12:21,580
Thank you so much.

3282
04:12:21,640 --> 04:12:22,380
Thank you, Chancellor!

3283
04:12:22,720 --> 04:12:23,660
Praise the sun!

3284
04:12:26,420 --> 04:12:27,240
So excited.

3285
04:12:27,380 --> 04:12:28,360
Welcome back!

3286
04:12:28,620 --> 04:12:29,500
Thanks for a whole month.

3287
04:12:29,500 --> 04:12:31,760
Did you already play the Stanley Parable?

3288
04:12:32,000 --> 04:12:34,280
Did I stream the Stanley Parable?

3289
04:12:34,480 --> 04:12:36,600
I feel like I did.

3290
04:12:37,180 --> 04:12:38,300
I'm gonna check.

3291
04:12:42,270 --> 04:12:43,650
I know I've played it though.

3292
04:12:44,070 --> 04:12:44,510
Bears!

3293
04:12:44,710 --> 04:12:45,970
Thanks for the 20th, dude!

3294
04:12:46,590 --> 04:12:47,050
Limbo.

3295
04:12:47,170 --> 04:12:48,170
I've never played Limbo.

3296
04:12:48,670 --> 04:12:49,450
I did, right?

3297
04:12:50,310 --> 04:12:51,610
Surely at some point.

3298
04:12:55,470 --> 04:12:56,670
Stanley Parable.

3299
04:12:58,970 --> 04:13:02,790
This is how I look up stuff on YouTube.

3300
04:13:03,250 --> 04:13:06,610
I wrote Stanley Parable.

3301
04:13:06,710 --> 04:13:07,910
Yeah, see I did!

3302
04:13:08,990 --> 04:13:09,870
I did, I did.

3303
04:13:09,970 --> 04:13:11,090
9 months ago!

3304
04:13:14,290 --> 04:13:15,250
Almost a year.

3305
04:13:16,050 --> 04:13:16,530
For you!

3306
04:13:18,150 --> 04:13:22,850
I developed a certain sentimentality towards this game because it's one of the first I ever watched an ENVY Tuber be on stream.

3307
04:13:26,430 --> 04:13:33,150
Actually, it's funny you mention that because when I saw this game, I was like, oh, I never played this game and I want to try it.

3308
04:13:33,450 --> 04:13:38,850
And also, even seeing it myself, I felt so nostalgic, right?

3309
04:13:39,010 --> 04:13:47,090
And so I was just like, I wonder if other people will also feel kind of like, ah, this reminds me of those good old days.

3310
04:13:47,370 --> 04:13:49,530
I mean, now can still be good old days.

3311
04:13:49,530 --> 04:13:53,110
Whatever days you enjoy are the good old days.

3312
04:13:55,370 --> 04:13:57,890
So, it's a new game by Stanley Parable devs.

3313
04:13:58,010 --> 04:13:58,450
Really?

3314
04:13:59,210 --> 04:14:00,430
Oh, look at that, thank you.

3315
04:14:01,110 --> 04:14:01,790
I didn't know.

3316
04:14:02,730 --> 04:14:03,950
Doki, thanks for the pop gift.

3317
04:14:14,410 --> 04:14:14,850
So...

3318
04:14:14,850 --> 04:14:16,610
Any day with Finto is the best day.

3319
04:14:18,070 --> 04:14:19,370
I appreciate it.

3320
04:14:19,830 --> 04:14:22,150
You don't have to hold me in such high regard.

3321
04:14:22,150 --> 04:14:24,950
But I appreciate it.

3322
04:14:24,990 --> 04:14:26,310
If you have fun, you know.

3323
04:14:27,150 --> 04:14:28,630
Why am I crafting tables?

3324
04:14:29,250 --> 04:14:29,550
Because!

3325
04:14:31,850 --> 04:14:33,790
Phantom Knight, thank you so much for the pop gift.

3326
04:14:36,250 --> 04:14:38,750
So I say that you're the best mint that ever minted.

3327
04:14:39,830 --> 04:14:41,030
Thank you, Solstice.

3328
04:14:41,070 --> 04:14:41,730
Thank you.

3329
04:14:46,650 --> 04:14:50,350
For the next Nintendo Direct, can you predict the Fire Emblem Awakening remake?

3330
04:14:50,350 --> 04:14:52,790
I don't know.

3331
04:14:52,930 --> 04:14:56,390
People say that I have the gift of prophecy now, but I've been begging for it.

3332
04:14:56,570 --> 04:15:01,090
I've been literally saying Tomodachi Life 2 for like 2 years.

3333
04:15:02,170 --> 04:15:03,710
For more than 2 years.

3334
04:15:03,950 --> 04:15:04,950
For many years.

3335
04:15:05,390 --> 04:15:08,350
I've been like, Tomodachi Life 2 is today.

3336
04:15:09,110 --> 04:15:09,970
Tomodachi Life 2.

3337
04:15:10,030 --> 04:15:12,530
That's actually why I started doing the Direct Watch Alongs.

3338
04:15:12,550 --> 04:15:15,650
Because I was like, I want the Tomodachi Life 2 eventually.

3339
04:15:16,270 --> 04:15:17,450
Eventually we'll get it.

3340
04:15:20,430 --> 04:15:22,630
What if we had never gotten it?

3341
04:15:23,710 --> 04:15:25,530
I guess I would have had to stick around forever.

3342
04:15:25,970 --> 04:15:27,230
Doing Nintendo Directs.

3343
04:15:29,130 --> 04:15:29,650
Maybe.

3344
04:15:32,090 --> 04:15:33,050
Love you, Mint.

3345
04:15:33,370 --> 04:15:34,390
Thank you, Optive.

3346
04:15:34,970 --> 04:15:36,210
Thanks for 6 months.

3347
04:15:45,580 --> 04:15:46,620
React channel.

3348
04:15:49,420 --> 04:15:51,740
The chat summary said you're nostalgic.

3349
04:15:52,700 --> 04:15:53,200
Am I?

3350
04:16:01,240 --> 04:16:02,500
That's so sweet.

3351
04:16:06,440 --> 04:16:07,500
Warm up your little heart.

3352
04:16:12,860 --> 04:16:15,400
Okay, this music is making me so sleepy.

3353
04:16:16,200 --> 04:16:16,820
I will.

3354
04:16:21,440 --> 04:16:23,740
I will go to sleep now.

3355
04:16:24,060 --> 04:16:25,760
I have a busy day tomorrow too.

3356
04:16:27,240 --> 04:16:30,820
I have to push back Devil May Cry a couple hours.

3357
04:16:31,320 --> 04:16:33,960
So I'll make the waiting room tonight.

3358
04:16:35,020 --> 04:16:36,900
And I will post about it.

3359
04:16:38,820 --> 04:16:44,280
Because I accidentally scheduled some recording on top of Devil May Cry.

3360
04:16:44,420 --> 04:16:44,740
I'm sorry.

3361
04:16:44,740 --> 04:16:44,860
I'm sorry.

3362
04:16:47,360 --> 04:16:48,400
I'm sorry.

3363
04:16:49,430 --> 04:16:53,340
So basically I was texting my hair salon.

3364
04:16:53,700 --> 04:16:55,600
My tax person.

3365
04:16:56,340 --> 04:16:58,440
And my recording person.

3366
04:16:58,620 --> 04:17:00,000
All at the same time.

3367
04:17:00,580 --> 04:17:01,240
On Tuesday.

3368
04:17:01,800 --> 04:17:05,180
And I thought I was texting my tax person.

3369
04:17:05,300 --> 04:17:07,580
But I was actually texting my recording person.

3370
04:17:07,940 --> 04:17:12,220
My tax person is not going to take nearly as long as it's going to be for recording.

3371
04:17:12,220 --> 04:17:15,360
And so I was just like, oh yeah, I can do this time.

3372
04:17:15,580 --> 04:17:18,680
And then I was like, oh no, I can't do this time.

3373
04:17:19,120 --> 04:17:19,880
Oh no.

3374
04:17:20,180 --> 04:17:22,940
And then I accidentally scheduled them on top of each other too.

3375
04:17:23,400 --> 04:17:24,460
Such a mess.

3376
04:17:26,060 --> 04:17:27,260
Sorry, I just pinched myself.

3377
04:17:30,700 --> 04:17:31,480
Oh yeah.

3378
04:17:34,880 --> 04:17:35,320
So...

3379
04:17:35,320 --> 04:17:36,700
I was like...

3380
04:17:37,140 --> 04:17:40,160
I was so overwhelmed.

3381
04:17:40,160 --> 04:17:42,020
And I was all over the place.

3382
04:17:42,280 --> 04:17:45,040
I've been kind of all over the place with stuff this week.

3383
04:17:45,080 --> 04:17:48,940
Because I have a lot of things I need to get done by the end of this month.

3384
04:17:50,820 --> 04:17:52,640
Thank you so much for the five gift card.

3385
04:17:53,500 --> 04:17:58,240
That was another reason to remind us to thank Minki for being there.

3386
04:17:58,360 --> 04:17:59,060
What do you mean?

3387
04:18:04,140 --> 04:18:05,540
You had three streams today.

3388
04:18:05,680 --> 04:18:06,220
I know.

3389
04:18:09,440 --> 04:18:10,160
I know.

3390
04:18:10,160 --> 04:18:14,460
And then I got another thing added today that I need to finish.

3391
04:18:14,620 --> 04:18:16,560
Oh gosh, I have so many deadlines.

3392
04:18:17,660 --> 04:18:21,280
Juggling appointments, like that gesture that's popular on Twitter nowadays.

3393
04:18:23,320 --> 04:18:23,960
Bilateral?

3394
04:18:24,680 --> 04:18:25,280
John?

3395
04:18:27,100 --> 04:18:30,440
Filed a voice recording of my taxes with the salon.

3396
04:18:31,600 --> 04:18:33,500
But I got my hair appointment.

3397
04:18:33,960 --> 04:18:36,100
And I got my recording tomorrow.

3398
04:18:36,420 --> 04:18:38,240
And I got my tax thing.

3399
04:18:39,880 --> 04:18:40,560
So...

3400
04:18:42,020 --> 04:18:46,120
I got to schedule another recording.

3401
04:18:47,820 --> 04:18:49,740
Exciting things, you guys.

3402
04:18:49,860 --> 04:18:51,020
Cool things are happening.

3403
04:18:53,000 --> 04:18:56,520
But you won't see them for like several many months.

3404
04:18:56,840 --> 04:18:57,900
So, sorry.

3405
04:18:58,160 --> 04:19:01,920
Right now is busy time and then it will pay off later.

3406
04:19:02,460 --> 04:19:03,240
I hope.

3407
04:19:08,720 --> 04:19:09,480
What's that sound?

3408
04:19:17,630 --> 04:19:19,030
I hope you guys had fun.

3409
04:19:19,590 --> 04:19:23,090
And listened to some good soothing music tonight.

3410
04:19:23,490 --> 04:19:25,310
And, you know, just kind of take it easy.

3411
04:19:26,130 --> 04:19:27,170
You have to get off Twitter.

3412
04:19:27,390 --> 04:19:27,990
Get off Twitter.

3413
04:19:28,130 --> 04:19:29,990
If you have to get off, you know...

3414
04:19:30,690 --> 04:19:31,270
If you have to...

3415
04:19:31,270 --> 04:19:33,530
Wait, I should finish that sentence.

3416
04:19:35,210 --> 04:19:37,070
If you have to get off the internet.

3417
04:19:37,470 --> 04:19:38,130
There you go.

3418
04:19:44,400 --> 04:19:46,660
I'm not judging what you do.

3419
04:19:46,660 --> 04:19:49,420
In your free time.

3420
04:19:56,160 --> 04:19:59,080
We are in no judgment zone.

3421
04:19:59,680 --> 04:19:59,740
Mostly.

3422
04:20:05,920 --> 04:20:08,760
Anyway, I'm gonna go before I make this anymore.

3423
04:20:11,380 --> 04:20:13,060
Anymore dangerous.

3424
04:20:13,640 --> 04:20:14,520
Anymore yabai.

3425
04:20:16,920 --> 04:20:17,740
Otsumito everybody.

3426
04:20:17,900 --> 04:20:19,440
Thank you so much for the stream today.

3427
04:20:19,540 --> 04:20:20,580
Thank you for the help also.

3428
04:20:20,980 --> 04:20:22,760
You guys were great help for...

3429
04:20:22,760 --> 04:20:25,600
Helping me with...

3430
04:20:25,600 --> 04:20:30,160
With the puzzles without really giving things away sometimes.

3431
04:20:30,480 --> 04:20:32,500
Until I was like really like...

3432
04:20:32,500 --> 04:20:33,620
I don't know what to do.

3433
04:20:33,800 --> 04:20:36,560
But then even then like that one puzzle you helped us...

3434
04:20:36,560 --> 04:20:39,200
I still didn't understand it until you guys described it.

3435
04:20:40,000 --> 04:20:41,420
The one with the exit sign.

3436
04:20:41,820 --> 04:20:43,160
So I really appreciate it.

3437
04:20:43,500 --> 04:20:44,380
Thank you guys.

3438
04:20:44,760 --> 04:20:45,740
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3439
04:20:46,220 --> 04:20:46,520
Otsumito.

3440
04:20:46,800 --> 04:20:47,920
See you guys later.

3441
04:20:48,280 --> 04:20:49,460
And I'll see you when I see you next.

3442
04:20:50,140 --> 04:20:50,440
Itterassha.

3443
04:20:50,740 --> 04:20:51,440
Have a good night.

3444
04:20:52,100 --> 04:20:52,700
Bye, bye.

3445
04:20:52,880 --> 04:20:53,460
Bye, bye, bye, bye.
