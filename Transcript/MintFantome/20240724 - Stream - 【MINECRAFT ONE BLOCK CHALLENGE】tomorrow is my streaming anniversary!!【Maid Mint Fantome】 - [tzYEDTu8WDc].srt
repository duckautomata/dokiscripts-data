1
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,600
Is it working?

2
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,120
Am I live?

3
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Is it working?

4
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,940
Get it out of me!

5
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,020
Hello!

6
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,520
Oh god, my voice is so dead.

7
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,660
My voice is so dead.

8
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,460
Oh my god, just like me.

9
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,300
Thank you.

10
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,520
You are dead.

11
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,100
I am.

12
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,880
That's why I said just like me.

13
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,820
Hold on one second, I'm gonna refresh YouTube real quick.

14
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,700
Okay, I think...

15
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,340
I haven't been around for many streams lately because of work, life, and football.

16
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,320
But I'm glad to start watching again.

17
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,900
I miss mint.

18
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,940
Hakuno and welcome back.

19
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,760
Thank you.

20
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,740
Oddballboy, thanks for the five.

21
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,840
My flight leaving Long Beach got delayed till Thursday.

22
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,980
You were basically me.

23
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
You were basically me.

24
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,520
That's when I was going to get back.

25
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,080
It was Thursday.

26
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,920
But...

27
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,960
Now I'm home.

28
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,460
What a mess did Cloud Strife cause.

29
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,300
You would have missed your anniversary.

30
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,320
I know, right?

31
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,820
I have a convention I'm even doing this weekend.

32
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,760
And I had to contact them and been like...

33
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,120
I don't know if I'm gonna make it home in time.

34
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,500
I don't know if I'm gonna make it home in time.

35
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,360
Let's talk a bit about...

36
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,800
I was gone the past couple of days.

37
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,520
I was at...

38
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,420
MGS Con!

39
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,740
Yippee!

40
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,980
I know, I don't know, maybe if you watch Barry...

41
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,940
You heard some of these already.

42
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,500
She talked some...

43
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,320
Did you see the Nendos?

44
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,480
Of course I did!

45
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,340
I went to...

46
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,340
MGS Con.

47
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,960
In case you're after, thanks for the 5 gifted.

48
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,240
Randall, thanks for the 5 gifted.

49
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,940
I think I saw Teacup.

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,860
Yeah, thanks for the gifted!

51
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,880
Spent all the weekend dealing with your crowd buddies.

52
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,420
Looking back, I'm excited to finally meet you at Anime Fest.

53
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm a little nervous.

54
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,040
That's this weekend!

55
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,080
Yeah!

56
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,760
Randall, thanks for the 10 gifted!

57
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,620
So...

58
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,440
It was truly...

59
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,300
The whole situation with the Cloud Strike was like...

60
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,980
It is Cloud Strike, right?

61
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,800
Right.

62
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,920
And Draco, thanks for the 20!

63
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,560
Thank you so much.

64
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,260
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

65
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,800
Yes, okay.

66
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,620
Oh, Crowd Strike.

67
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,900
Wait, wait, is it Cloud Strike or Crowd Strike?

68
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm glad you had fun at MGS Con.

69
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,040
I know it's been a while, but I wanted to give you an update about that interview.

70
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,380
I got the job!

71
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,080
That's my president!

72
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,020
So it is!

73
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,240
Congratulations!

74
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,400
Was that not a bit?

75
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,320
No, wait.

76
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,120
What's the...

77
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,660
What's the bit?

78
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,780
I'm always serious.

79
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,760
What are you talking about?

80
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,120
But no!

81
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,080
I went to MGS Con this past weekend.

82
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,080
Which is a one-day Metal Gear themed convention.

83
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,240
I got to see Maddy!

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,920
Oh my god.

85
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,100
The music is so dramatic.

86
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,380
The music!

87
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,800
Minecraft loves Maddy.

88
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,820
Good morning, Mito!

89
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,420
Good morning, Mito.

90
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,020
And...

91
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,560
The timing.

92
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,260
Yeah...

93
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,720
I don't know.

94
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Maybe there are some people that had like a...

95
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,200
I don't know.

96
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,440
A spiritual awakening?

97
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,400
A sixth sense moment?

98
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,080
I'm not sure.

99
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,320
But if you sensed...

100
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,400
If you had a...

101
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,760
If you had a little chill...

102
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,860
It might have been me.

103
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,800
But I was definitely haunting Barry.

104
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,240
Basically the entire time.

105
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,760
Shout out to Barry.

106
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,960
Barry Bug.

107
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,300
The Better Bug.

108
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,260
The Better Bug.

109
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Better than...

110
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,180
She's the best bug.

111
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,620
I've never known a better bug than Barry the Bug.

112
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,960
The audio is so loud!

113
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,140
Turn down!

114
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,000
But...

115
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,620
But...

116
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,060
Nice tongue twister.

117
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,940
Say that times fast.

118
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,020
Barry Bug the Better Bug.

119
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,000
Barry Bug the Better Bug.

120
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Barry Bug the Better Bug.

121
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,200
Barry Bug the Better Bug.

122
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,420
Welcome back, boss.

123
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,660
Happy early anniversary.

124
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,120
Yippee!

125
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,260
Thank you!

126
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,740
Cloud Strife?

127
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,060
Yes.

128
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,240
Basically.

129
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,100
Don't know any other bug.

130
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,580
But...

131
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,400
Yeah.

132
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,200
I was really grateful because...

133
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,520
Honestly...

134
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,200
I...

135
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,520
She is streamed on...

136
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,500
She streams on Twitch.

137
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,520
But she streamed yesterday.

138
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,800
I believe it was.

139
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,520
Sorry.

140
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,120
My time is all discombobulated.

141
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,180
Sorry.

142
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,460
I don't know what day it is.

143
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,390
I don't actually...

144
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,680
Is it...

145
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,960
It's Tuesday.

146
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,700
Isn't it?

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,540
Right?

148
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,060
I actually have no idea...

149
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,340
What day it is.

150
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,220
But...

151
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,700
Time is...

152
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,180
Time is an illusion.

153
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,680
Okay.

154
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,580
It is Tuesday.

155
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,380
Well...

156
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,460
Tuesday for me.

157
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:44,760
So...

158
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,720
Wednesday for you?

159
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,080
Okay.

160
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:48,940
But...

161
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,800
I'll explain.

162
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,160
It's...

163
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,480
In a minute.

164
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,320
Um...

165
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,320
I was really grateful because Matara wasn't able to make it to the con.

166
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,500
And I was gonna be all alone.

167
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,060
All by my lonesome.

168
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,780
And...

169
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,040
Like...

170
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,960
Barry talked about how she like stalked me.

171
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,940
But truly I was haunting her the whole time.

172
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,360
I'd be like...

173
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,860
Oh...

174
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,460
So Barry...

175
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:09,840
What do you...

176
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,380
Um...

177
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,040
What do you...

178
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,620
What do you...

179
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,160
Did you wanna go something...

180
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,640
Did you have another thing you wanted to do next?

181
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:17,940
Oh...

182
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,300
You...

183
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,800
No...

184
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,080
You...

185
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,300
You wanna do what I wanna do?

186
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,040
What do you want to do?

187
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,180
So...

188
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,800
I was just like...

189
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,020
She and I being awkward together was so good.

190
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,160
Um...

191
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
It's Minto time.

192
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,120
Good evening Minto.

193
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:35,640
Good evening.

194
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,080
Um...

195
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,920
Do you guys like the new emotes?

196
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,620
Do you guys like them?

197
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,020
I have no more slots anymore.

198
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,560
So if we want more emotes...

199
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,660
Like we're maxed out.

200
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,240
If we want any more emotes, we have to...

201
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,860
Switch them out...

202
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,960
Do you know what day it is?

203
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,160
Well tomorrow is a different day.

204
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,000
It's April 30th.

205
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,780
Have fun playing Minecraft.

206
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,600
Thank you, Polly!

207
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,660
You did good, boss.

208
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,180
Yippee!

209
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,680
Emotes are pretty good.

210
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,600
So my flight, luckily, was only a little delayed.

211
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,880
Into the con weekend.

212
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,640
So I get there.

213
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,240
And honestly, I just like, have no idea what to do.

214
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm just sitting in the lobby like...

215
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,240
I'm people watching.

216
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,980
Because I'm like, look at everybody walking around with their Metal Gear T-shirts!

217
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,600
Oh sorry, I'm starting to get emotional.

218
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,400
And all their merch and their bags and everything.

219
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,560
So great.

220
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,620
Why are flight delays so common?

221
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,460
Is it common in North America?

222
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,240
No, no!

223
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,900
It was because of the cloud strike.

224
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,600
The cloud strike.

225
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,320
Got a text saying it might be delayed again.

226
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,980
What flight...

227
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,900
Oh wait, don't actually...

228
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,480
Don't tell me your airline.

229
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,860
Don't tell me your airline.

230
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,480
Because, you know, I don't want you to...

231
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,120
But, I heard that...

232
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,560
Oh, crowd strike.

233
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,260
Thank you, sorry.

234
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,980
Crowd... crowd strike.

235
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:34,940
I heard that some airlines are doing more poorly than others, so...

236
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,140
Felt chilly at MGS Con.

237
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,580
I even saw floating UOs and a big stinky aura.

238
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,000
What are you talking about?

239
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,760
Wasn't that Barry that went off about how good I smelled?

240
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,820
Which I...

241
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,100
She kept talking about how good I smelled.

242
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,700
And I didn't get, like, secondhand embarrassment.

243
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,480
I felt like I was...

244
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,860
I was like, is this how it feels when people listen to me talk?

245
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,560
I felt...

246
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,240
I felt like too much...

247
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,960
I was hearing too much of myself from her.

248
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,420
And I was really embarrassed about it.

249
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
I was like...

250
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,200
I was like, no way, this is how I sound?

251
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,580
Unreliable narrator?

252
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,480
What are you talking about?

253
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,780
I envy the bug I will squish.

254
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,320
But...

255
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,140
No...

256
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,740
I think...

257
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,640
I mean...

258
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,660
I think ectoplasm smells kinda good.

259
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,440
Exactly how you understand.

260
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,420
Why do you guys watch me?

261
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,560
That is...

262
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,300
That is...

263
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,220
Kind of my whole feeling.

264
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,660
That's kind of what I...

265
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,840
I got a lot of emotions this weekend.

266
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,400
But one of them was truly...

267
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,020
Why do people watch me?

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,160
I think you've all gaslit yourself into...

269
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,060
Into finding me enjoyable.

270
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,160
I swear.

271
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,100
At last you understand.

272
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,300
Two of them.

273
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Because we're all weirdos.

274
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,160
But I got to meet...

275
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,600
Oh my gosh.

276
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,300
I met David Hayter for the first time.

277
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,720
I talked about this too.

278
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,700
In the...

279
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,380
In the...

280
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,140
Twitter space that I did.

281
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,600
But in case you didn't watch that.

282
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,160
And also...

283
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,000
Stockholm ourselves into loving you.

284
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,620
Loving you...

285
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,580
Is not easy.

286
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,580
You are horrible.

287
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,160
I've stockholmed myself...

288
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,060
Into loving you.

289
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,140
That poster story was so funny.

290
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,520
Oh!

291
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,500
I was like...

292
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,260
Poster story?

293
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,260
I like...

294
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,780
Oh my gosh.

295
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,960
I went up to David Hayter.

296
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,100
Like tears forming in my eyes.

297
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,700
I'm like...

298
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,280
I can't cry.

299
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,200
First of all.

300
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,400
Because I don't want to cry in front of him.

301
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,140
Second of all.

302
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,660
Because...

303
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,300
I don't want Barry seeing me cry.

304
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,960
I was like...

305
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,340
Oh god.

306
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,320
And I go...

307
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,840
Oh my gosh.

308
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,580
But I go up to him.

309
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,100
And I saw that he had a print of...

310
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,200
MGS Delta.

311
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,060
Snake.

312
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,700
And I was like...

313
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:15,840
Wow.

314
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,920
He's so fast.

315
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,620
And I like the Delta design.

316
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,280
And oh...

317
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,560
I don't know.

318
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,200
I like it.

319
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,500
And so I...

320
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,360
I was like...

321
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:23,620
Can I...

322
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,400
I got an autograph.

323
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
And then I bought that as an additional autograph.

324
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:28,840
And...

325
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm showing...

326
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:30,860
Oh my gosh.

327
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,200
After he signs it...

328
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,020
After he signs it...

329
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,380
And I kind of was just like...

330
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,680
You...

331
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:37,720
You...

332
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,280
You...

333
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,880
You...

334
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,160
You've made my entire career.

335
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,800
And he was just like...

336
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,040
Hi.

337
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,160
Haha.

338
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,960
What are you...

339
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,400
What?

340
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,670
I'm like...

341
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,990
You...

342
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,470
You...

343
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,270
I...

344
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,730
Everything shifted at that moment.

345
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,630
And...

346
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,270
And...

347
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,630
He was like...

348
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,010
Oh...

349
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,290
What?

350
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:02,950
I know, right?

351
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,350
And...

352
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,530
So he's signing it.

353
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,270
And I'm like...

354
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,850
Not even paying attention to the print.

355
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,610
I'm just like...

356
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,330
Trying to hold my...

357
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,410
My composure.

358
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,250
I'm just like...

359
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:15,790
Oh gosh.

360
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,410
If I...

361
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,490
If I...

362
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,730
If I let one crack...

363
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,450
You know how like...

364
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,870
The dam has cracks.

365
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,910
And if just a little bit gets through...

366
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,030
Everything gets through?

367
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,610
That's how it was gonna be.

368
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,970
And so...

369
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,610
Um...

370
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,490
But...

371
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,930
Afterwards he signs it.

372
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,390
And then...

373
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:33,850
He...

374
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,530
Gets up from the table.

375
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,070
And walks over to Barry and I.

376
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,550
He didn't have to do this.

377
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,830
But he like...

378
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,090
Puts his hand on both of our shoulders.

379
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,670
And he goes...

380
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,570
By the way...

381
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,910
You're pretty good.

382
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,430
Haha.

383
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,890
Sorry.

384
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:46,390
Haha.

385
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,290
He said it to everybody.

386
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,630
We weren't special.

387
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,610
But...

388
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,930
Oh my god.

389
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,830
What a dream.

390
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,550
David Hayter is just a very handsome guy.

391
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,050
Maddie and I are convinced...

392
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,650
If you've never seen...

393
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,130
So basically...

394
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,530
He starred in a movie called...

395
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,650
Guyver 2.

396
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,710
The second one.

397
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,670
Guyver.

398
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,330
And like...

399
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:15,630
He's...

400
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:15,970
He...

401
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,730
Back then...

402
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,210
He was...

403
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:17,490
I mean...

404
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,770
He's still very attractive.

405
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,370
But...

406
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:19,390
But...

407
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,170
Back then he was like...

408
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,370
Such like a heartthrob.

409
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:21,730
You know?

410
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,390
He seems very nice.

411
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,630
He was so nice.

412
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,110
He...

413
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,370
You can tell he loves what he does.

414
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,030
You know what I mean?

415
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:29,930
But...

416
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,070
We kind of...

417
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,330
Maddie and I have like...

418
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,610
Determined that like...

419
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,290
He...

420
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,050
He is like...

421
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,110
Same level of like...

422
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,850
Harrison Ford.

423
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,550
Like...

424
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,790
In a parallel universe...

425
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,990
This guy is like...

426
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,090
Harrison Ford levels of famous.

427
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,730
He's like this heartthrob that everybody loves.

428
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:45,790
But...

429
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,070
In this universe...

430
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,010
He's just...

431
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,370
He's just...

432
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,390
He's just a little too nerdy.

433
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,730
To like...

434
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,330
He's just a little bit too much of a dork maybe.

435
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,290
If you like him so much why don't you marry him?

436
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,350
Pretty sure he's already married.

437
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,330
But also...

438
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,450
I think I would throw up every day.

439
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,610
Probably hearing his voice.

440
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,090
Harrison Ford could have gone nerd but death did not.

441
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:21,470
Yeah!

442
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,870
We met...

443
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,170
Christopher Randolph who is the voice of Otacon.

444
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,270
Who is just a total absolute sweetheart.

445
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,970
And I know Barry just spilled our absolute spaghetti.

446
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,830
Thank you guys for all the super chats by the way.

447
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,170
I'm trying to like...

448
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,210
I'm trying to like...

449
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,430
You talk about me so differently but you didn't recognize my favorite character.

450
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:41,970
Hold on.

451
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,450
I have a story for that later.

452
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,590
I have a story for that later.

453
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,690
Can you play the game?

454
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,190
Oh my gosh.

455
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,490
Stop!

456
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:48,150
I...

457
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,710
I'm talking first.

458
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,390
What do you mean?

459
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,290
Okay.

460
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,030
I'm done.

461
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,310
I'm done.

462
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,670
Okay.

463
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,230
I'll...

464
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:01,630
See.

465
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,090
I'm done.

466
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,470
I'm done talk...

467
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,730
Okay.

468
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,610
I won't talk anymore.

469
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,750
Okay.

470
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,650
Let's just play...

471
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,610
Let's just play the game.

472
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,510
Okay.

473
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,590
Okay.

474
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:18,790
Okay.

475
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,250
Let's just play the game.

476
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,610
I'm stuck on this block and I don't really know...

477
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,270
Do I break it?

478
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,430
Oh.

479
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,190
Yipee.

480
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,110
That's so unfair.

481
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,630
What.

482
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,370
She won the game.

483
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,890
Why am I losing bricks?

484
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:46,830
Oh wait.

485
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,190
Maybe I should build around too.

486
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,050
Right?

487
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,770
So that things don't drop.

488
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,930
Please place other blocks.

489
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,590
I'm working on it!

490
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,490
I'm working on it!

491
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,110
Guys!

492
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,650
Let me finish my art!

493
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,040
One black at a time.

494
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,070
Yeah, so we met him.

495
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:25,650
He was very nice.

496
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:26,570
Everybody was very nice.

497
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,390
One of my favorite people to meet was Paul Eiding.

498
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,410
And it's so crazy.

499
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,530
New Journey.

500
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,090
Place 20 blocks.

501
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,150
Oh my gosh!

502
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:39,410
Sorry!

503
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,710
There was...

504
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,330
I put a pin on my desk and I thought it was a bug.

505
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,930
My sensei pin.

506
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,870
From the hand cam, I thought it was a bug.

507
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,210
And I scared myself.

508
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,250
I scared myself looking at it.

509
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,700
Oh gosh.

510
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,120
You guys...

511
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,460
Okay, let me just tell you a little bit about my journey today, right?

512
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm on like...

513
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,980
Very few hours of sleep.

514
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,500
What?

515
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,160
Stop running away from me!

516
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,460
I'm on very few hours of sleep.

517
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,500
Because I took a red eye.

518
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,600
And um...

519
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:38,860
Wah!

520
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,060
Arigato!

521
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,660
Arigato-chu!

522
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,000
Merl!

523
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,720
Thank you!

524
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,840
Getting in early on saying happy anniversary, your streams.

525
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,620
Since your comeback have been the most fun I've ever had with a Vtuber.

526
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,140
Shut up!

527
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,640
No way!

528
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,040
I can't...

529
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,360
I can't wait to see what else you do.

530
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:57,920
P.S.

531
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,940
I was on a conference call.

532
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,520
With the CEO of CloudStripe today.

533
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,580
He seemed pretty sorry.

534
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,200
Oh my gosh!

535
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,140
Thank you so much for the Big Dodo!

536
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,760
Thank you!

537
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,960
I really appreciate it!

538
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,460
Merl!

539
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,580
Merl!

540
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,060
But yeah, I took a red eye.

541
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,320
Which means...

542
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,740
Oh shoot.

543
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:23,920
Moss!

544
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,980
Which is a very...

545
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,260
Very late flight.

546
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,520
If you don't know, right?

547
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,820
It means it's like a flight really late in the night.

548
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,640
And um...

549
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,360
So...

550
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,260
What had happened was...

551
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,440
I...

552
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,400
I was actually checking into my flight.

553
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,820
And I was like putting in my bags.

554
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,720
Because I had to check a bag.

555
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,040
And I was putting it in.

556
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,980
And it was like...

557
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,300
It was like...

558
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,840
Oh by the way, we can't check your bag.

559
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:00,700
There's something wrong.

560
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,460
And I was like...

561
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:01,540
Oh.

562
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,460
That's weird.

563
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,820
And then when I...

564
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,220
I'm doing this on the app, right?

565
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,800
And when I go back to the app...

566
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,940
Or when I go back to my check-in screen...

567
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,400
It's like...

568
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,020
We're sorry your flight is cancelled.

569
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,080
And I was like...

570
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,020
What do you mean by that?

571
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,700
What do you mean by that?

572
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,880
I love red eyes.

573
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,640
I don't.

574
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,620
And so...

575
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,740
I was like freaking out.

576
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,240
I was like...

577
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
I was panicking just a little bit.

578
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,300
How do I get underneath?

579
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,800
Thank you.

580
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,760
It's like...

581
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,480
Hey, by the way, you can make a thing.

582
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,960
And...

583
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,360
Oh, water.

584
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,860
Ah, water, water, water.

585
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,940
But...

586
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,060
Let's make some utensils, right?

587
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,190
So...

588
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,570
I'm like...

589
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,530
Searching...

590
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,890
The one flight...

591
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,750
It like...

592
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,650
It automatically rebooked me for some reason.

593
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,630
Thanks, Rico!

594
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,210
I heard that Southwest was completely unaffected because they're still running everything on Windows 3.1.

595
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,190
Which hasn't been updated in 25 years!

596
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:29,810
What?

597
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,810
Maybe I should have taken Southwest then.

598
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,930
You mean tools?

599
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:38,550
Oh.

600
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,040
Yeah.

601
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:46,880
So...

602
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,980
You guys, I'm test...

603
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,400
Hold on.

604
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Let me finish.

605
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,540
Let me finish.

606
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,120
Let me finish.

607
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,540
Sorry.

608
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,450
I got an Amber Alert all of a sudden.

609
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,190
What's

610
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:11,820
happening?

611
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,840
What's going on?

612
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,520
Wake up.

613
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,020
Wake up.

614
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,500
Um...

615
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,020
And...

616
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,780
Where was I?

617
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,840
Um...

618
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,060
Okay.

619
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,340
So...

620
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,960
So I'm like...

621
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,300
It puts me on a flight on Thursday.

622
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,320
And...

623
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,380
Actual jump scare.

624
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,580
Puts me on a flight on Thursday.

625
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,360
Let's make some shovel too.

626
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,000
And I was like...

627
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,100
No!

628
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,780
That's too late!

629
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,980
I'll miss my stream!

630
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,500
I'll miss my anniversary stream!

631
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,260
I'll miss...

632
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,660
I'll miss my convention!

633
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,140
Appearance!

634
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,360
I can't do this!

635
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,760
And...

636
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,000
So...

637
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,320
Um...

638
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,760
I'm like struggling.

639
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,060
I'm like on the phone with them for three hours.

640
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:58,980
I'm on hold for so many hours trying to get a person to give me a refund or something.

641
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,520
There was another flight that I found that uh...

642
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,540
But it wouldn't let me rebook it.

643
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,880
It was just a bunch of craziness.

644
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,000
And so I'm like...

645
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,500
Oh my god.

646
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,980
Could I request a lullaby?

647
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,560
I'm going in and out of sleep.

648
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,460
If not a simple stupid fries works.

649
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,820
That hurt.

650
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,660
Are you okay?

651
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,200
Go to sleep.

652
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,500
Go to sleep.

653
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,840
Go to sleep little baby.

654
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,620
Close your eyes.

655
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,460
Go to sleep.

656
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,020
Um have sweet dreams of...

657
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,900
Thighs.

658
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,520
Close your eyes.

659
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,920
Meat, cheese, fries.

660
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,040
Oh god I feel so sleepy.

661
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,020
And you'll...

662
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,080
Crash!

663
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,560
Wait, which is the one block?

664
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,200
Glad you got home safe and time.

665
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,840
Thank you!

666
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,940
Wait, hold on.

667
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,180
I gotta put on some music.

668
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,580
Oh, hold on.

669
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,820
What do we want to listen to?

670
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,760
Minto's thighs.

671
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,020
What are you thinking about?

672
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,740
Put on Lullaby music?

673
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,540
Oh, this one's called Smoothie House.

674
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,440
This is a jazzy...

675
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,820
Limp Bizkit.

676
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,880
People are trying to sleep!

677
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,440
People are trying to sleep.

678
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,200
Everybody be quiet.

679
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,240
Stop the chat.

680
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,180
Is this it?

681
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,120
Is this the one, right?

682
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,080
Okay, good.

683
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,520
Go to sleep.

684
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,500
Little baby.

685
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,100
Think of suckling on a nip.

686
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,680
Just like when you were a baby.

687
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,080
And you just suckled the tip.

688
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,480
Little baby dreams.

689
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,760
Baby world.

690
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,260
Think... imagine... put yourself as a baby.

691
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,380
Your scream woke me up.

692
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,210
With my jump scare that I thought it was a bug.

693
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,490
Every single stream, I'm left asking myself...

694
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,730
How are you even real?

695
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,900
Well, some people say ghosts aren't real.

696
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,100
Gives me a bit of an existential crisis.

697
00:28:59,600 --> 00:28:59,720
You know?

698
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,360
Oh my god.

699
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,220
Mysterious traitor!

700
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,640
I can order a cat!

701
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,190
Sorry, I didn't mean to scream so much.

702
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,990
Maybe I should trade...

703
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,750
Oh, I don't have enough dirt.

704
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:33,670
I don't have anything.

705
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,930
Get out of here.

706
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,310
Get off my land.

707
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,870
Get off my land, please.

708
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,970
Get off my land.

709
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,670
Okay, anyway.

710
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,970
Oh, that's my shovel.

711
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,290
Sorry.

712
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,730
I'm really jumpy.

713
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,810
Like I said, I took a really late flight.

714
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,110
And the day before my flight, all I did...

715
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,550
I...

716
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,510
You guys, I didn't know what to do.

717
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,290
I was...

718
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,550
So, MGS Con was Saturday.

719
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,410
Sunday, Maddie and I walked around the beach.

720
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,230
We...

721
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,750
We...

722
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,110
I...

723
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,850
I got sunburnt a little bit.

724
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,330
On my head.

725
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,150
But we walked around the pier.

726
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,990
And the beach.

727
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,870
And we just...

728
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,090
You know.

729
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,570
So, I did walking then.

730
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,970
And then the day after...

731
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:21,350
Then...

732
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,870
That was before I even knew anything would be canceled.

733
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,390
And...

734
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,790
And I...

735
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,690
I'm scared of mob spawning.

736
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,850
I'm gonna turn it down just a little bit more.

737
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,310
Okay.

738
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,550
Okay.

739
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:39,830
Okay.

740
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:40,890
And...

741
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,290
Touch grass.

742
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,150
Haha.

743
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,110
Touch sand.

744
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,190
Yeah.

745
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,550
We touch sand.

746
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,430
But...

747
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,090
You scream more here than in a horror game.

748
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:58,790
I'm sorry.

749
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,650
I'm really...

750
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,790
My brain is not quite working.

751
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,130
I didn't know what to do.

752
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,190
So, I ended up...

753
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,270
I ended up trying to go to a museum.

754
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:09,830
And...

755
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,930
It was closed.

756
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,610
Oh, no!

757
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,090
I can't!

758
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,310
What's step two?

759
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,730
Mind the block.

760
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,190
A hundred...

761
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,590
Oh, boy.

762
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,270
I tried to go to a museum.

763
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,370
Apparently, everything is closed on Mondays.

764
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,990
Which is really just...

765
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,010
So sad.

766
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,170
Um...

767
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,090
Oh, I tried to go to two museums.

768
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,570
And they...

769
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,390
Everything was closed.

770
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,270
So, I ended up, like, just walking.

771
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,830
I ended up walking for, like, ten minutes.

772
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:39,970
Like, ten miles.

773
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,130
Like no joke.

774
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,290
Hypothetical situation.

775
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,170
Your OSHI is talking to you about the hypothetical situation of your OSHI seeing your nipples.

776
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,050
Oh!

777
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,690
What would you do?

778
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,590
Um...

779
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,330
So, my OSHI talks about...

780
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,210
If my OSHI talked about seeing my nipples, is what you're saying.

781
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,240
Hmm...

782
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,600
Hmm... Sounds like... I did something correct.

783
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,390
Um...

784
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,610
Look.

785
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,870
Jeff...

786
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,490
If you're still around... If I didn't scare you off...

787
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,220
If I didn't... So, there was a guy...

788
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,880
At the convention... Dressed as Raiden...

789
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,260
And I'm getting flamed online for this.

790
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,700
He was dressed as Raiden.

791
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,140
And... He was in a towel.

792
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,320
With his little Raiden wig on and everything.

793
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,800
He was dressed... As Raiden.

794
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,660
And I was like, oh it's just like that scene in MGS2.

795
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,680
And I was like...

796
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,240
How is that... How is me seeing Raiden...

797
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,560
Seeing Raiden...

798
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,280
In a towel...

799
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,000
Not at like...

800
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,520
You are correct.

801
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,440
Did he do the cartwheel?

802
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,380
He should have.

803
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,880
In fact... How disappointing that he didn't.

804
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,480
How disappointing.

805
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,120
How big Chung's life was MGSCon?

806
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,440
Sounds like it was a lot of fun.

807
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,360
Wish I could have gone.

808
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,900
It was so much fun!

809
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,840
I hope they do it again next year.

810
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,340
I'm too embarrassed to hear what Berry said about me.

811
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,200
So anything she said about me was probably a lie.

812
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,580
Just... Just... Just think of... Just believe that...

813
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,740
Don't believe Andor's lies.

814
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,480
Anything... Anything she said about me...

815
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,260
Is a total fabrication.

816
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,600
We can build trees!

817
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,080
Tomorrow is my birthday!

818
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,300
Coincidentally the same day as your anniversary!

819
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,580
Can I get a happy birthday?

820
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,120
Of course not!

821
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,580
Happy birthday to you!

822
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,960
Happy birthday to you!

823
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,320
Happy birthday dear Matt!

824
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,260
Happy birthday to you!

825
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,330
So...

826
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,350
I don't know.

827
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,990
Like I said, I couldn't really listen to her talk about how...

828
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,130
How much I smelled.

829
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,180
Minecraft music.

830
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,420
Oyma!

831
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,160
Berry literally said you are the sweetest person.

832
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,360
Um...

833
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,500
And...

834
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,860
Everything she says...

835
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,780
I said what I said!

836
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,780
I'm not a good... I'm not a good ghost.

837
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,720
I'm an evil ghost.

838
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,000
When will you guys understand?

839
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,000
When will you guys understand?

840
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,940
When will you guys understand?

841
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,120
God!

842
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,180
She...

843
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,040
You...

844
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,420
You compared him to getting embarrassed to watching Meryl turning right in front of a thousand listeners.

845
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,240
Put yourself in their shoes.

846
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,400
Also, Berry went on a whole existential crisis because of how nice you were.

847
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,400
Well, that's how awesome I felt too.

848
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,940
Like... I don't know.

849
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,220
Being...

850
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,300
Being in a place where I...

851
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,020
Maybe... I don't know.

852
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,500
If you guys went to Off-Kai...

853
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,160
Maybe...

854
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,900
Maybe you had like a similar...

855
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,660
Like...

856
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,800
A similar...

857
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Existential crisis where you're just like...

858
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,720
It truly...

859
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,340
It truly made me just be like...

860
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,100
Oh my gosh...

861
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,580
Maybe...

862
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,660
Maybe people are just nice, you know?

863
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,680
Maybe people are...

864
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,400
Like...

865
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,660
When you're surrounded by people that are...

866
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,560
You know...

867
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,100
Involved in your fandom...

868
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,140
And just something that you really love...

869
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,780
And something that is so...

870
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,580
You know...

871
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,880
You're so passionate about...

872
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,840
And you hold in such high regard...

873
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,720
And you never want to ever let go...

874
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,600
And you're so sad that it's over...

875
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,400
And you're just like...

876
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,120
Oh my gosh...

877
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,760
When...

878
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,100
I have nothing else to look forward in my life...

879
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,640
To now...

880
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,520
Or my afterlife...

881
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,000
Because...

882
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,920
It's over...

883
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,380
And you just see how nice everybody is...

884
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,340
You're just like...

885
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,540
Just makes you feel like...

886
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,820
Maybe...

887
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,300
Maybe there is some good in this world...

888
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,760
Maybe there is some good in this world...

889
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:58,860
Maybe there is some good in this world...

890
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,920
No...

891
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,640
I'm just saying...

892
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,060
I mean...

893
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,480
I just don't wanna...

894
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:17,540
Go around...ridding style... I'm see... So beautiful...

895
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:23,460
And just be beautiful... And receive...

896
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,260
The love of your life...

897
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,300
That that's what a person should be like... It's love...

898
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,880
an... Hello, Well... I think it's...

899
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,580
A 유ия...

900
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,400
Lu...

901
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,980
I was just like, you're so nice.

902
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,040
And I'm just like, I didn't do anything.

903
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,660
I didn't do anything.

904
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,520
It does make you think or like, you know, it makes you like...

905
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,720
kind of remember like, you know, when people are so poopy online.

906
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,220
Nine times out of ten, they're not like that in person.

907
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,020
And it's like, oh my gosh, maybe touching grass is important.

908
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,600
Maybe they actually, maybe I should touch grass more.

909
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,620
I don't know.

910
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,800
Turns out people love you because you're great.

911
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,100
I was haunting everybody.

912
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,760
And then also, I got to meet Cynthia Harrell.

913
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,300
Which I only saw her in concert before.

914
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,280
I got to actually meet her and talk to her.

915
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,920
And I got to tell her that I went to the MGS concert.

916
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:45,840
Touch grass?

917
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,260
Never!

918
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,120
I got to tell her that I went to the concert because of her.

919
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,680
And how much of an inspiration she is to me.

920
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,860
And she's just such a nice lady.

921
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,460
And she sings Snake Eater.

922
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,220
She's the singer of Snake Eater.

923
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,680
And...

924
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,740
I got to...

925
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,280
The crazy thing is I actually got to sing Snake Eater with her.

926
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,660
But it wasn't just me.

927
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,580
I mean, it was like a crowd.

928
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,920
But then also, I was invited to a party with Maddie.

929
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,200
After the con was over.

930
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,980
And she was at the party.

931
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,580
And then we also sang Snake Eater again.

932
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,640
And I was just like...

933
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,500
What is this?

934
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,920
What is this life?

935
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,900
What is going on?

936
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,700
I hope you've had a great day.

937
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,620
I've always been a lurker.

938
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,560
I just want to know how you're special to me.

939
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,460
Thank you, Cyber!

940
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,700
Wait.

941
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,600
What's her profile picture?

942
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,940
Is that Hoshino from Blue Archive?

943
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,600
Mention it during my haunting.

944
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,940
Oh, you sensed me?

945
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,340
Developed a sixth sense?

946
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,840
You might want to get...

947
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,580
You might want to go get blessed or something, you know?

948
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,360
Can you move?

949
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,200
Can you like...

950
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,520
Please, leave me alone.

951
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,620
I thought you would disappear or something.

952
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,580
What is this?

953
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,340
Stone!

954
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,000
Stone, stone, stone.

955
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,560
Boom!

956
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,100
Mint experiencing the good of people.

957
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,080
Also Minecraft being more of a jump scare than usual.

958
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,960
It's because...

959
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,180
You know.

960
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,160
It's because...

961
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,460
Things like pop up, you know?

962
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Do not come to European content.

963
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,020
All the EU wisps want to dribble you like a basketball for time...

964
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,960
time zone crimes.

965
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,720
And it'll ruin our image.

966
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,560
No!

967
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,380
Go back now!

968
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,320
Actually, I mentioned this recently.

969
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
How like...

970
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,220
Um...

971
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,220
The reason I haven't been able to do...

972
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,380
You can blame Matara for the reason I haven't been able to do so many...

973
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,880
So many...

974
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,920
Early day...

975
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,140
Streams.

976
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,960
Me dribbling.

977
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,520
I thought you meant dribble like you were gonna dribble your spit on me.

978
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,380
Oh my gosh!

979
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,120
Lacuna!

980
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,360
Thank you so much for the pink!

981
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,140
Fancy seeing you play Minecraft Love Black.

982
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,900
Maybe you'll find a music disc that says...

983
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,460
Sounds like VTuber BGM or something.

984
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:30,960
What?

985
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,800
So glad you had an amazing time at MGSCon and got to meet two MGS OGs.

986
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,500
Looking forward to more Minta forever.

987
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,640
Thank you!

988
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,500
But um...

989
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,940
The reason it's Matara's fault is because of the podcast.

990
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,600
Because...

991
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,240
Uh oh, wait.

992
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,100
Which one is it?

993
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,430
Wait, which one is it?

994
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,410
Oh no, no, no.

995
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,670
Is it this one?

996
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,230
Uh oh.

997
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:56,990
Oh!

998
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:57,490
Oh!

999
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:57,930
Oh!

1000
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,910
Okay, it's this one.

1001
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,790
Wait, he's gonna fall.

1002
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:03,410
Nevermind.

1003
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,410
Because of the podcast, she...

1004
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,370
She...

1005
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:14,390
I have to keep my days open because I'll be like, Hey Matara, we gotta record the podcast.

1006
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,230
And she's like, I'm gonna stream.

1007
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,650
I really wanna stream.

1008
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:18,630
And I'm like, yeah, me too.

1009
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,450
But like...

1010
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,390
Then she'll sometimes just like...

1011
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,370
You know...

1012
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,310
Go away.

1013
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,230
Go away.

1014
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,370
Go away.

1015
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,590
Love you, Minto.

1016
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,530
Thank you!

1017
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,810
So you can...

1018
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,690
You can...

1019
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,830
Blame her.

1020
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,770
Place slabs around it.

1021
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:38,830
You're so smart!

1022
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,530
I was hearing you and Barry talk about if JSCon is giving me FOMO.

1023
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,010
Oh, anyways.

1024
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,130
However, I'm glad I got to see you at Off Guy.

1025
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:50,450
Yeah!

1026
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1027
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,050
He was crying about Time Zone and then there's...

1028
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:59,490
Us NA folks very grateful you're streaming at such friendly ESC timing.

1029
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,450
You asked Maria how she would feel if you saw...

1030
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:04,790
If...

1031
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,190
Wait.

1032
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,010
If her Oshii saw her in a towel.

1033
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,420
No?

1034
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,430
Really appreciate you, Minto.

1035
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:17,810
I'm sick.

1036
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,310
Oh no!

1037
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,350
I just feel better!

1038
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,610
There are dribblers.

1039
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,930
Like b-ball.

1040
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,870
And there are dribblers.

1041
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:24,890
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1042
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:26,990
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1043
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:27,630
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1044
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:27,810
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1045
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:27,970
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1046
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:28,430
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1047
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,870
Okay, love song...

1048
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:31,670
STOP IT!

1049
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,550
I don't wanna hear this anymore.

1050
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,250
Oh, the music disappeared.

1051
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,880
Just like a baby.

1052
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,840
I'm dribbling like a baby.

1053
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,200
Oh my gosh, this is a pain in the butt.

1054
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,260
Having to switch tools.

1055
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,260
When do I enter the Stone Age?

1056
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,660
Maybe I can.

1057
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,040
Maybe I can make a stone.

1058
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,440
Maybe I can make a stone!

1059
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,760
Yes!

1060
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,960
Yeah, but would you lose?

1061
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,680
A baby dribbling contest?

1062
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,520
Or... wait.

1063
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh no!

1064
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,560
Is this the one?

1065
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,080
Oh gosh.

1066
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,280
Yes, okay.

1067
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,300
Oh, actually since I just made this pickaxe, let's get rid of it first.

1068
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:34,600
Nice.

1069
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,620
Yeah, more stone.

1070
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,080
Nah, I'd win.

1071
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,660
If there was a competition...

1072
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,660
Any sort of competition, I think I'd win.

1073
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,040
I'm not so weak.

1074
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,900
Did you know that mint was a singular leaf?

1075
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,400
Are you saying I'm all by my lonesome?

1076
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,560
What is going on up here?

1077
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,480
If there was a competition of any sort...

1078
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,440
I'm no loser.

1079
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,940
I'm gonna win anything.

1080
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,620
How about a being tall competition?

1081
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,720
I hate you!

1082
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,260
I hate...

1083
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:15,940
This...

1084
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,600
This...

1085
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,720
Is unfair!

1086
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,380
How could you go so low?

1087
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,490
Those don't exist.

1088
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:31,950
Tall competitions.

1089
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,030
They'll never exist.

1090
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:39,870
When I become president, I will make sure of it.

1091
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,470
How could you go so low?

1092
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,340
Tall competitions do exist.

1093
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,240
No?

1094
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,710
Tell me.

1095
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,510
Tell me.

1096
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,290
Never thought I'd be putting up with a competition like this.

1097
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:57,810
What?

1098
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:58,390
Hello?

1099
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,160
I never thought I'd hear mint say the word hate.

1100
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,480
No.

1101
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,220
I have a lot of hate in my body.

1102
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:17,620
I'm sorry.

1103
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,700
Again, like I said, I'm an evil ghost.

1104
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:22,940
Oh!

1105
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,900
We got a new guy!

1106
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,420
He'll give us jungles.

1107
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,680
We can get seeds!

1108
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,280
Wait, you guys.

1109
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:30,660
You guys!

1110
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,400
Guys, can we afford all of this?

1111
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,360
Okay, that's 45.

1112
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,360
Let's just buy it all.

1113
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,660
Oh, I was gonna say we had just enough.

1114
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,600
We can order a sheep.

1115
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:52,840
Buy!

1116
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,200
Buy!

1117
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:53,500
Buy!

1118
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,520
Okay, get out of here.

1119
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:55,980
Actually, no.

1120
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,080
Oh wait, he's gonna reset.

1121
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,280
Go out.

1122
00:47:59,340 --> 00:47:59,740
Go away.

1123
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,920
Go away.

1124
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,000
Go away.

1125
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,400
Go.

1126
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:03,860
Bye-bye.

1127
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:04,660
Bye!

1128
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:10,740
I just lost the spelling competition because that should have been pro basketball game.

1129
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,480
What?

1130
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,940
Barry told us to ask you about the special thing you did.

1131
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,140
Special thing?

1132
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,460
Special thing?

1133
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,580
Hold on, let me message her.

1134
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,320
I don't even know what she...

1135
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,620
What's the special thing?

1136
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,160
What's the special thing I did?

1137
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,480
Mintz killed a man?

1138
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,640
I ran over a baby this morning actually.

1139
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:41,780
Ran

1140
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
over a baby this morning.

1141
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,520
With my suitcase.

1142
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,540
At the airport.

1143
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,340
And the mom was like...

1144
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,400
Cause the baby ran out in front of me.

1145
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,020
Or rather behind me because I was pulling my suitcase.

1146
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,840
The mom was like...

1147
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,220
I'm so sorry!

1148
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,800
And I was like...

1149
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,960
I'm sorry!

1150
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,580
I ran over your baby!

1151
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,760
I

1152
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,950
ran over a baby.

1153
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,070
I kept running over people.

1154
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,470
I tasted blood.

1155
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,770
I'm a killer.

1156
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,410
This is the skin of a killer Bella.

1157
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,710
Lucky baby.

1158
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,010
Lucky baby.

1159
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,570
What's wrong with you?

1160
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:40,970
Oh, I'm sorry.

1161
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:41,730
I thought that was...

1162
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:42,850
I forgot that was wood.

1163
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,520
Or stone is what I meant to say.

1164
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,000
Don't worry, you did the right thing.

1165
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,740
The baby came out of nowhere.

1166
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,760
And I mean...

1167
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,840
Like I said, I was pulling my suitcase.

1168
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,440
And he ran out behind me.

1169
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,080
And I just...

1170
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,780
Right over his head.

1171
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:05,900
Right over his head.

1172
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:08,900
The

1173
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,700
mom apologized to me.

1174
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:17,500
The mom apologized to me.

1175
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,620
Oh my god, she could have...

1176
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,840
I could have gotten eaten alive by that.

1177
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,880
She could have been like...

1178
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,540
You ran over my baby!

1179
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,760
Wait, which one is it you guys?

1180
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,340
Is it this one?

1181
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,780
Someone said put slabs down for these bad boys.

1182
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:32,940
Let's do that.

1183
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,660
Slab.

1184
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,820
I'm gonna put some slabs down.

1185
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,000
Slab, slab, slab, slab.

1186
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,960
Slab, slab, slab, slab.

1187
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,100
For the child.

1188
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,180
Amazing!

1189
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,880
That right there is why you're the best.

1190
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,080
Running over a baby with the MGS...

1191
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,680
Merch suitcase?

1192
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,260
No, that's the worst part.

1193
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,080
This bag is heavier than my actual suitcase.

1194
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,620
Because it has all my laptop stuff in it.

1195
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,880
So it's even heavier!

1196
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:08,030
It had my entire streaming set up.

1197
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,070
The baby just took it all.

1198
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:14,910
Like a damn champ.

1199
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,490
Kids will just insert themselves in front of moving objects in ways that defy physics.

1200
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:22,210
It's true.

1201
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,630
It's true.

1202
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,600
Oh my gosh.

1203
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,320
It was the first thing that happened after I got off the plane.

1204
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,560
And so, I've been awake... I don't know.

1205
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,540
Like I said, I did 9 miles yesterday.

1206
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:46,400
And then, I went from... I went to my hotel.

1207
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,400
I took a quick shower.

1208
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,340
I took a quick shower.

1209
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,020
And then I...

1210
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,000
Went to the airport after walking for so long.

1211
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,700
Wisps are loyal AF.

1212
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,940
I easy guide the child.

1213
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,440
Don't lie.

1214
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,640
We know you don't bathe.

1215
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,420
No, it was the most... Okay.

1216
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,380
I got the hotel room scared that I wouldn't be able to go home.

1217
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,880
And it was a pricey hotel... What the hell is a mace?

1218
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,700
What's a... What are these?

1219
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,640
Heavy core?

1220
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,440
Breeze rod?

1221
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,940
I've never heard of any of this before.

1222
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,940
But um... Try... Auto summary is wild.

1223
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,920
What does it say?

1224
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,480
It's a new weapon.

1225
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:45,840
Really?

1226
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,200
There's actual new stuff.

1227
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,260
Onion.

1228
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,320
I'm glad you guys like the new emotes.

1229
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,800
I'm so happy.

1230
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,100
But uh...

1231
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,800
Yeah, so I walked and then I took a shower.

1232
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,780
I paid for this hotel room thinking that I would be there longer.

1233
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,780
And um...

1234
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,820
So I basically was in the hotel room for like...

1235
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,220
3 hours.

1236
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,360
Cost me $200.

1237
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,500
Most expensive shower of my life.

1238
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,100
The baby gonna have a great story to tell when they're grown up.

1239
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,720
I got run over by the one I didn't even expect.

1240
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,600
Yeah, big oof.

1241
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,200
Big oof.

1242
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,860
The whole thing just put such a...

1243
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,200
Put such a...

1244
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,120
Damper on everything.

1245
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:48,660
But!

1246
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,660
And me walking around...

1247
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,560
Which I still...

1248
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,040
Even though I didn't get to go home on time...

1249
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,100
I still had so much fun yesterday and...

1250
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,440
Walking around and stuff even.

1251
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,260
Because...

1252
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,920
Even though I didn't get to go to...

1253
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,000
Even though I didn't get to go to...

1254
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,120
The...

1255
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:08,740
The museums.

1256
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:10,880
Um...

1257
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,120
I was walking and I was like trying to find like parks to just walk in.

1258
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,700
And I saw like one that was like called a memorial park.

1259
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,580
And I was like, oh!

1260
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,620
Okay, cool.

1261
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,760
Memorial park.

1262
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,040
And I go there and I'm just walking laps and I...

1263
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,680
Well, first I get there and I'm like, oh, this is just a straight up cemetery.

1264
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:27,800
How...

1265
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,440
How suiting for a ghost, right?

1266
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,240
I was like, maybe I'll see some other ghosts here.

1267
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:32,680
I don't know.

1268
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:33,820
Um...

1269
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,260
Maybe I can socialize.

1270
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,980
Like I didn't do enough this week.

1271
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,580
This past weekend.

1272
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,020
And um...

1273
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,320
And uh...

1274
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,940
Oh my gosh.

1275
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,160
When is this thing gonna grow?

1276
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,820
He's got the cherry sapling!

1277
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:50,520
Huh!

1278
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,800
I must buy.

1279
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,500
Prismarine shard.

1280
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,540
We can live without for now.

1281
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,140
Pale wolf.

1282
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,740
But um...

1283
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,880
I walked to the cemetery...

1284
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,520
Through the cemetery.

1285
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,120
And I noticed by one of the graves...

1286
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,400
Um...

1287
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,960
There's like kind of a group of people.

1288
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,600
And I was just like, oh, I guess, you know, family.

1289
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,600
You know, whatever, whatever.

1290
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,260
The child incident was just an unfortunate speed bump.

1291
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,080
On an otherwise great trip.

1292
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:18,740
Yes.

1293
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:20,860
Um...

1294
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,000
But uh...

1295
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,740
Later on, the group of people left.

1296
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,440
And I'm looking at the grave.

1297
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,400
And I was like...

1298
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,280
Looking at it.

1299
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,140
For a second.

1300
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,220
And I was like, wait a second.

1301
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,460
I recognize this.

1302
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,140
It...

1303
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,120
I recognize it from far away.

1304
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:36,740
Because...

1305
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:36,960
It's...

1306
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,360
I see this.

1307
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,200
And this might give it away.

1308
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,480
It was covered in lipstick marks.

1309
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,900
All over it.

1310
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,920
And do you know what people do?

1311
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,300
They go to Marilyn Monroe's grave and they kiss it.

1312
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,440
It was Marilyn Monroe's grave.

1313
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,440
I was like, woah!

1314
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,300
Oh my gosh.

1315
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:57,940
I just...

1316
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:58,960
We...

1317
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,000
It was just an accident that I was there.

1318
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,260
I forgot, what...

1319
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:04,800
Hold on.

1320
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,000
I looked it up earlier.

1321
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:16,460
I'm not sure what this place was called because I was also just like, what other, what other, um, did you talk to her?

1322
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,360
She wasn't available, you know?

1323
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,080
I mean, she's, she's a celebrity.

1324
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,960
I'm a mint phantom, you know?

1325
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,260
Did you kiss it?

1326
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:24,500
No.

1327
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:33,140
But, um, I had to stop myself from taking a picture of Big Boss in front of me.

1328
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:40,280
I was like, maybe that's a little too far, but I

1329
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:48,570
was looking out for who else is buried in that cemetery.

1330
00:56:48,910 --> 00:57:05,530
Apparently, it's like the most celebrity-filled cemetery, um, uh, like Jodie Fawcett's there, Peter Falk is there, Kojima would have done it, but

1331
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,340
yeah.

1332
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,600
I don't know.

1333
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,280
I don't know.

1334
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,280
I'm dead too, though, right?

1335
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,240
I can get away with it.

1336
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,120
Guys, I'm just as dead.

1337
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,080
Wait, is this a new one?

1338
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:25,800
No.

1339
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,560
I'm just as dead!

1340
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,080
It's okay when ghosts do it.

1341
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:31,360
Yeah!

1342
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,500
I mean, like, come on!

1343
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:36,500
Right.

1344
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,000
Get out!

1345
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:38,880
Go away!

1346
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:44,930
Where were you buried, Minto?

1347
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,760
I don't know.

1348
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:07,230
I think, uh, I don't know if I ever got a proper burial.

1349
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:11,290
Outer heaven.

1350
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:13,710
Good golly.

1351
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:17,550
Shifur Gore.

1352
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,670
It has been a long time since I died, so.

1353
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:22,950
You know.

1354
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,170
Oh, there goes my shovel.

1355
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,050
Can it stop raining, please, for two seconds?

1356
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:31,990
When am I gonna get some, like...

1357
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,550
animals, like sheep and stuff?

1358
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,650
Hmm, indeed.

1359
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:36,610
Hmm.

1360
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,400
After Zanzibar.

1361
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,280
Happy anniversary.

1362
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,060
Thank you.

1363
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,140
Dead men tell no tales.

1364
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,300
Are you dead?

1365
00:58:58,820 --> 00:58:59,500
Yeah?

1366
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,320
I am dead.

1367
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,500
You can be ashes on Venom Snake's face.

1368
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,900
Ooh la la.

1369
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,380
You can be ashes on Venom Snake's face.

1370
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,860
I'm glad you didn't eat him up like a cheeto does.

1371
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,760
Dead men tell no tales.

1372
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,520
What does that mean?

1373
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,380
Like they don't tell stories?

1374
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,060
Because what am I doing then?

1375
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,860
You're the exception.

1376
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,940
Really?

1377
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,080
Why are my trees growing?

1378
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,120
Do I need more dirt?

1379
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,360
Grow!

1380
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,400
Um, yeah, I get it.

1381
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,020
Sophia!

1382
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,520
Thank you for your help!

1383
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,700
They can't testify in court.

1384
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,840
So they're like, dead men can't snitch on you.

1385
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,680
Dead men can't tell you where they...

1386
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,880
how they died.

1387
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:17,320
Stop!

1388
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,320
He's trying to...

1389
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,560
Go away, please.

1390
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,140
Go away.

1391
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,420
You're embarrassing.

1392
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,500
Go.

1393
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,950
They can't rat you out.

1394
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:28,730
They can't rat you out.

1395
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,630
Exactly.

1396
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:30,710
No witnesses.

1397
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:34,410
But they didn't think about ghost maids.

1398
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,150
No, they didn't.

1399
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,450
Now he won't tell tales.

1400
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:47,470
Dead men tell no tales.

1401
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:49,650
He

1402
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:58,430
wasn't a villager.

1403
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,630
He was a mysterious trader.

1404
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:01,710
He was a trader.

1405
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,050
Maybe you have to water the trees.

1406
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,160
Oh...

1407
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,820
Why do I go through the things that I go through?

1408
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,380
Why do I allow this?

1409
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,260
I think being a Vtuber has truly changed.

1410
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:31,420
What?

1411
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,680
What?

1412
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,240
You're back!

1413
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,020
It's got a cave shop.

1414
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,180
Oh, we can get some gravel.

1415
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,260
Let's get some gravel.

1416
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,080
We can get some gold.

1417
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,560
Beehive?

1418
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,080
If only we had some bees.

1419
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:56,050
Vtubers.

1420
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,210
Vtubers have changed.

1421
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:00,830
Wait, let's get a little...

1422
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:01,050
Oh, wait.

1423
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,630
I was gonna say let's plant our seeds but we have no water.

1424
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:05,790
Hmm...

1425
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,610
He must tell his tales.

1426
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:13,130
Beehive.

1427
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:18,450
Hmm...

1428
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,240
You're so needy.

1429
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,560
You're so close to me.

1430
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,340
Why are you so obsessed with me, mysterious trader?

1431
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,300
Why are you so obsessed with me?

1432
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,460
Are you obsessed with me?

1433
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,620
There he goes.

1434
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,080
When is it gonna stop raining though?

1435
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,020
For real?

1436
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,460
Sounds familiar.

1437
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,820
Maybe he's a wisp.

1438
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,900
One thing though.

1439
01:02:52,140 --> 01:03:02,600
Like, you know, when I do cons and stuff, even if it's something like MGS con that I have absolutely no relation to, I'm just I'm just haunting for fun.

1440
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,320
I'm not there to like, you know, be a guest or anything.

1441
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,220
Which, oh!

1442
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,520
I'm so sorry that it didn't work out with me appearing at the convention.

1443
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:23,900
Like, I had everything set up and like, five minutes before the time, they sent me a message and they're like, we're behind schedule.

1444
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,300
We have to cut.

1445
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,900
We have to cut it.

1446
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,820
I'm so sorry.

1447
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,440
And I was like, it's okay!

1448
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,620
Like, they were so, so apologetic.

1449
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,240
Again, everybody at the convention was so nice.

1450
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:40,960
Like, I can't I just can't be... I can't I can't be upset.

1451
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,640
So, uh...

1452
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,880
But, so I'm so sorry if you were just like, oh, I wonder if Minto's gonna show up.

1453
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,400
Um, and it was just gonna be like a quick little thing anyway.

1454
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,040
But, um...

1455
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,500
It stopped raining!

1456
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:57,740
Yippee!

1457
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:00,980
Uh...

1458
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,480
Next year, definitely.

1459
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:04,540
Oh, maybe.

1460
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:05,160
We'll see.

1461
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,100
Um...

1462
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,340
But, uh...

1463
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,220
What was I saying?

1464
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:13,440
Oh!

1465
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:19,540
Even when it's something like MGSCon that I have no relation to, I truly, I'm just...

1466
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:21,380
Oh my gosh.

1467
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:21,940
I'm gonna be...

1468
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,260
I was gonna say I'm gonna be sappy.

1469
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,900
You know what I was literally about to say?

1470
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,780
I was literally about to say...

1471
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,060
Oh my gosh.

1472
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,620
Wisps are just...

1473
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,440
the best.

1474
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,360
Wisps are the best fandom.

1475
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:46,880
You guys are the absolute best.

1476
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,260
And then...

1477
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,140
And then what appears?

1478
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,220
None other than...

1479
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,580
That...

1480
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,700
I take

1481
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,240
it all back.

1482
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,300
I take it all back.

1483
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,950
You guys are absolute freaks!

1484
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,210
You guys are such freaks!

1485
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,890
What's wrong with you guys?

1486
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,830
Why can't you just be normal?

1487
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:29,110
What is absolutely wrong with you guys?

1488
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,970
Why do you say the things that you say?

1489
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,890
Why are you so bold and brazen?

1490
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:38,270
Why do you think that you can just say whatever you want?

1491
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:41,070
We learn from you.

1492
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,430
You did not learn!

1493
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:46,930
You did not learn to ask people to poop on their chest because of me!

1494
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,010
When have I ever said that?

1495
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,550
That Supa is not a representation of the majority.

1496
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:56,430
Chat reflects the streamer derogatory.

1497
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:00,770
Don't lump me in with that!

1498
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,450
Don't lump me in with that!

1499
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:05,170
And you know what the greatest insult of that is?

1500
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,250
The greatest insult...

1501
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,950
is um...

1502
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:12,490
was...

1503
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:13,250
the amount.

1504
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:20,010
You'll make such a ridiculous demand, such a ridiculous request.

1505
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:21,510
At that...

1506
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:22,890
At that price?

1507
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,480
Oh, an apple.

1508
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,540
Can you get hungry in this version?

1509
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,340
Sick freak.

1510
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,580
We learn from the best boss.

1511
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,520
If you want such a prized...

1512
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,940
such a delicacy...

1513
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,760
You must pay up.

1514
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:51,660
Lump me in with the majority.

1515
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,900
So would you reconsider at a different amount?

1516
01:06:58,900 --> 01:06:59,080
Well...

1517
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,060
No, I didn't say that.

1518
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,640
I'm just saying it was a little offensive, you know?

1519
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,200
We're talking about Mint's secret...

1520
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,480
Cleveland streamer instructional members video.

1521
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,240
Cleveland streamer instructional members video.

1522
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,360
Huh?

1523
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,440
What does that even mean?

1524
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,100
What's a Cleveland streamer?

1525
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:19,500
What's a Cleveland streamer?

1526
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,280
I just sat down.

1527
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,680
You want us to do what?

1528
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:30,650
Do not google.

1529
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:33,990
Huh?

1530
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,620
Cleveland streamer?

1531
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,340
Is that from Idaho?

1532
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:52,870
He's back.

1533
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,370
Raw iron!

1534
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,530
We need that for real.

1535
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:01,870
Actually, I wonder if I can make a...

1536
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,110
furnace now.

1537
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:04,710
And then...

1538
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:05,130
Oh, wait.

1539
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,430
But I can...

1540
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,870
Let him cook.

1541
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:11,730
I can burn...

1542
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:13,650
Like this, right?

1543
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:15,210
There we go.

1544
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,670
There we go!

1545
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,220
These Supas need to cease?

1546
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,840
What's going on with you guys?

1547
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:27,940
I'm gone for like two days.

1548
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,900
I wish to feed from the forbidden Play-Doh fun factory.

1549
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,400
I googled it.

1550
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:35,920
Don't do it.

1551
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,300
That shit literally is sick.

1552
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,120
What's going on?

1553
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,300
What's happening?

1554
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,380
Why are you guys such a...

1555
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,100
What's happening?

1556
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,140
What are you trying to introduce me to?

1557
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,840
You guys...

1558
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,800
Is Minecraft breaking your brains?

1559
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:52,480
What's going on?

1560
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,720
We got a call!

1561
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,310
Come back!

1562
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:06,790
Thank you for the 50 gifted.

1563
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:07,470
Thank you!

1564
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,470
Thank you so much!

1565
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,190
That is freaky, freaky tonight.

1566
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,870
Come on, guys.

1567
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,550
Let's dial it back a little bit.

1568
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:24,170
Let's instead talk about murder.

1569
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,910
Murder the man!

1570
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:27,670
Murder, murder...

1571
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:29,490
Murder, murder the man!

1572
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:31,450
Don't...

1573
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:33,350
Murder the man!

1574
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:37,550
Let him live now!

1575
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:41,110
I got all that I needed from him.

1576
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:45,130
Time to gouge my eyes out.

1577
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,050
You guys scare me.

1578
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:49,690
We got a...

1579
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:50,830
Dripstone!

1580
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:54,030
Murder the man!

1581
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,550
Murder the man!

1582
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:57,570
Messed up.

1583
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,010
Dark, perverted fact.

1584
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:00,130
Minto-chan is cute.

1585
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,210
Chovek, go to sleep.

1586
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:07,870
But yeah, once the...

1587
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,510
Once the podcast is over, I'll be able to do more...

1588
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,750
Mid-day thingies.

1589
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:14,750
Right now, it's really just kind of...

1590
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,750
Because Matara's schedule is like...

1591
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,350
Kind of whack.

1592
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:18,950
Oh!

1593
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:22,030
Well...

1594
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,390
Freak phantom.

1595
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:25,350
What is your wisdom?

1596
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:26,730
You two!

1597
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:28,170
Go to sleep!

1598
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:28,970
Meaches fries.

1599
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:32,870
Detective Jones.

1600
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,310
Thanks for the captain.

1601
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:37,150
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1602
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:40,070
Yesterday was my B-day!

1603
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:42,330
But Friday will be my last day living...

1604
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:44,410
In the house I spent my life in.

1605
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,890
But birthday wish I'd much rather have.

1606
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:46,570
Words of encouragement.

1607
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,210
Much love from a wisp who's been here since your introduction video.

1608
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:50,270
Helen!

1609
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:53,630
You really have been around for so long.

1610
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:54,610
Thank you!

1611
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:56,510
Oh my gosh.

1612
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:58,850
I know it can be scary.

1613
01:10:59,330 --> 01:10:59,510
Oh!

1614
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:03,430
But...

1615
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:04,970
You're...

1616
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:07,590
You are taking a big step in your life.

1617
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:10,230
And I believe that...

1618
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:11,910
You will be just fine.

1619
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,450
And happy birthday!

1620
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:19,610
Happy birthday to you!

1621
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:22,830
Happy birthday to you!

1622
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:26,250
Happy birthday dear Alan!

1623
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:32,690
Happy birthday to you!

1624
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:37,830
Happy birthday dear Alan!

1625
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:38,270
Good luck!

1626
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:40,770
You got this.

1627
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,710
In Minecraft, where's the music?

1628
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,930
We got the advancement.

1629
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:50,590
I am iron...

1630
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,200
Let him cook.

1631
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:01,080
When is this guy gonna grow up?

1632
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,300
This little sapling.

1633
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,980
Unrelated to Phonoceros, my beloved.

1634
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,080
Diva, welcome to the membership.

1635
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:13,200
Encore.

1636
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,480
Onion.

1637
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:23,920
There we go.

1638
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,320
I like Minecraft music so much.

1639
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,900
It's always so calming.

1640
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,380
Not when the game is being so freaky.

1641
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,080
Let's see.

1642
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,380
Should I get an iron one or should I save it?

1643
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,720
I always love your streams.

1644
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,380
Well, anything you do, I'm kind of lost right now.

1645
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:54,400
What do you do to make the bad brain worms go away?

1646
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:18,930
Eat the brain worms.

1647
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,550
Play Metal Gear Solid.

1648
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,010
Yeah, replace them with...

1649
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:24,570
Actually, that's such a good thing though.

1650
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,830
Replace it with a different kind of brain worm.

1651
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:27,790
You know?

1652
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:29,710
Instead.

1653
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:32,650
That way you don't have...

1654
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:36,690
You don't have one brain worm.

1655
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:38,690
You'll have a different type of brain worm.

1656
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:40,510
That's a brain worm.

1657
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,790
It could be a really more dangerous brain worm, but...

1658
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:48,070
Worm eater!

1659
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,650
I like how you can see the sun through the block.

1660
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,830
Brain worm farm.

1661
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,270
I don't know, because I have lots of brain worms.

1662
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:08,750
I think about lots of things.

1663
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:14,770
I have...

1664
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:15,610
I have...

1665
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:18,250
Okay, don't tell anybody, but I might...

1666
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,010
I think I have, like...

1667
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:22,410
Self-esteem issues, you know?

1668
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:24,430
Oh my god, Pies!

1669
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:25,270
You scared me!

1670
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:30,250
Since we're in baseball season, do you think you'd be a better pitcher?

1671
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:30,990
Wait.

1672
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:32,510
Do you think you'd be better...

1673
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:33,630
Be...

1674
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,110
Better a pitcher or as a hitter?

1675
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,490
I think a pit...

1676
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:38,690
No.

1677
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:39,810
Hitter.

1678
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:42,390
I'd be a good hitter.

1679
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:43,590
I think.

1680
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:47,230
I've never played baseball once.

1681
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:50,330
Man, self-esteem...

1682
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:51,710
I said don't tell anybody.

1683
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:52,770
Don't even...

1684
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:52,930
Don't...

1685
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:53,370
You know.

1686
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:56,210
I know I'm a 10-side genius.

1687
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:58,550
Perfect ghost maid.

1688
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,770
But sometimes I have also problems.

1689
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:03,830
Sometimes I have my...

1690
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:05,370
I do have a little bit of flaws.

1691
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:08,030
Not as much as you guys, but like...

1692
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:08,750
You know.

1693
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:12,510
You know.

1694
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:14,910
I'm trying to brisket.

1695
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:15,690
Oh.

1696
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,490
I'm about to try a brisket.

1697
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:19,950
What does it mean, trying a brisket?

1698
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:21,210
Trying to brisket.

1699
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,230
I've been cooking for the past two days.

1700
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,270
Can you bless it with your maid powers?

1701
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:26,530
Yeah!

1702
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:27,230
Yeah!

1703
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:35,920
Oh!

1704
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,140
Make it delicious!

1705
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:40,500
Moe!

1706
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:41,900
Moe!

1707
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,520
Kyun!

1708
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,700
There you go.

1709
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:57,310
Moe!

1710
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:57,810
Moe!

1711
01:15:58,010 --> 01:15:58,470
Moe!

1712
01:15:58,670 --> 01:15:59,290
Kyun!

1713
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:00,990
Moe!

1714
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:01,850
Moe!

1715
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:02,290
Kyun!

1716
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:06,030
Good evening, Minto.

1717
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:06,570
Good evening.

1718
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:14,450
Oh my gosh.

1719
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:15,970
We're close to buying more things.

1720
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,990
I want to order a cat.

1721
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:19,850
So unfair.

1722
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:24,090
Don't you...

1723
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:24,310
Huh?

1724
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:24,730
... Me.

1725
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:26,190
You have nothing I want.

1726
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:26,730
Leave.

1727
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:28,250
Leave.

1728
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,030
Huh!

1729
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,510
Goodbye.

1730
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:33,550
Oh wait!

1731
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:34,870
I can start making torches too.

1732
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:35,250
Can't I?

1733
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:40,120
Let's make 8.

1734
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:45,640
Yay!

1735
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,340
Now it's a little less spooky.

1736
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:50,980
Get off!

1737
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,180
She's killed so many people.

1738
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,040
I told you, I'm a vengeful ghost.

1739
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:00,040
My bagel just did a magical girl transformation into a cross sword.

1740
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:00,800
What happened?

1741
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,760
How did this turn into a block?

1742
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,060
Wasn't it just bushes just a second ago?

1743
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,660
How does it change like that?

1744
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,640
I'm a boy, thanks for the fob, gifted.

1745
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,980
But yeah, I don't know.

1746
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,400
It's hard to say what else happened at the convention.

1747
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:41,120
I talked about it mostly in the Twitter space.

1748
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:47,980
Saving up my limited gacha bucks for a character with a huge gat coming out tomorrow.

1749
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,340
Can you chaff the desire sensor for me?

1750
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,500
Wait, in what game?

1751
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:54,940
What game?

1752
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:55,460
What game?

1753
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:56,980
What game?

1754
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,360
What game?

1755
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:57,840
Zazamos.

1756
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:59,040
What game?

1757
01:17:59,160 --> 01:17:59,520
What game?

1758
01:17:59,540 --> 01:17:59,940
What game?

1759
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:00,260
What game?

1760
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:08,920
I polled for Ako today in Blue Archive.

1761
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:12,940
I didn't get her the first time or the second time.

1762
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,720
But I got her the third time!

1763
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,340
Oh, it's a ZZZ.

1764
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,560
Is that game any good?

1765
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,380
Is it a Hoyoverse?

1766
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,460
I tend to not do Hoyoverse things, but...

1767
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:33,640
The maid girls are really, you know, they're targeting me, I think.

1768
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:35,860
It's cool.

1769
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,760
What's the gameplay like?

1770
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,860
What's the gameplay like?

1771
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,500
Definitely Hoyoverse.

1772
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,640
Definitely Hoyoverse.

1773
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,120
Three guys in it and everything.

1774
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,260
Simple hack and slash with stages.

1775
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:06,900
Okay.

1776
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:09,560
Yeah.

1777
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:10,500
Oh yeah.

1778
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,820
It doesn't sound, like, not fun.

1779
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,980
Just, like, kind of thinking, like...

1780
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,280
When I, like...

1781
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:19,600
What's so great about, like, some of the gacha games is I can just kind of...

1782
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,120
Kind of play them very casually.

1783
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,820
You can skip cutscenes.

1784
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,040
But that's how you see the characters, right?

1785
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,880
Can't wait for horse gacha.

1786
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,840
Soon till.

1787
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,100
Soon till.

1788
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,600
Current limited banner is a maid shark girl.

1789
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,720
Yeah, I see art of her everywhere.

1790
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:48,260
I see so much art of the maid shark girl.

1791
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:50,540
People love her.

1792
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,940
I mean, the design is really, really cute.

1793
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:54,880
I know why.

1794
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:55,780
I can see why.

1795
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,160
They would be a fan.

1796
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,160
Big sloppy tail.

1797
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:13,370
Yeah.

1798
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:14,430
But...

1799
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:18,410
Yeah.

1800
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:19,050
I don't know.

1801
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:20,070
I just, ah...

1802
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:22,450
I couldn't ever get into Genshin when I tried.

1803
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:24,690
And...

1804
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:26,470
I don't know.

1805
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:30,930
Maybe it's just, like, the style of Hoyo-verse games for me.

1806
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:32,310
Feel...

1807
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:35,270
I don't know.

1808
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,110
I don't know what it is.

1809
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:38,330
I can't describe why.

1810
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:46,070
The dailies are easy.

1811
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:46,890
That's good.

1812
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:48,010
In this one.

1813
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:54,490
It's more persona-y with action combat.

1814
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:04,410
Are the stories any good?

1815
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:09,510
Maybe I will try as easy as I can.

1816
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:12,410
But I can't do any more gacha.

1817
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:22,030
Hi girly girl.

1818
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:24,450
Hi little girly girl.

1819
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:26,550
What?

1820
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:28,630
Come here.

1821
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:29,650
Come here.

1822
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,190
Pretty simple up to where I've gotten.

1823
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:34,810
That's my cat.

1824
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:35,610
Come here.

1825
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,430
You gonna jump in my chair?

1826
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:40,870
Come here.

1827
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:41,930
I'm making room for you.

1828
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:43,070
Sit in my chair.

1829
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:43,570
No?

1830
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:44,490
No?

1831
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:45,790
Come here.

1832
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:48,230
Oh my god, she just flopped on the ground.

1833
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:50,270
She's such a plopper.

1834
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:52,650
Gacha anonymous.

1835
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:59,090
I really truly try to limit myself to one gacha.

1836
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:04,790
And right now I'm so blue archive pilled that I can't look at anything else.

1837
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:07,650
What are you doing stinky?

1838
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:09,390
Stinky Johnny.

1839
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:12,710
She's cleaning herself.

1840
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:13,830
I think she's okay.

1841
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:17,190
She might want to go eat soon though.

1842
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:20,910
I'm doing three.

1843
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:22,510
Kitty love.

1844
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:25,650
She's just rolling around on the ground.

1845
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:27,010
What are you looking at?

1846
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:29,310
What's got your attention?

1847
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:30,610
Is there a bug there?

1848
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:32,390
What are you looking at?

1849
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:34,070
You're scaring me.

1850
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:34,670
Is there a bug?

1851
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:35,170
Stop.

1852
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:35,710
Stop.

1853
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:36,830
Why are you sniffing the ground like that?

1854
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:37,630
Stop.

1855
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:37,990
Stop.

1856
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,270
There's nothing there.

1857
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:43,050
She's having delusions.

1858
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:46,170
Is this the lap kitty?

1859
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:48,070
Well, she was supposed to be.

1860
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:48,750
What is...

1861
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:52,990
Summons a trial challenge when dropped into the void?

1862
01:22:57,650 --> 01:22:58,630
What is this?

1863
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:02,730
Did you know Niki had a collab with Dave the Diver?

1864
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:03,650
I did know that.

1865
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:04,910
And I'm still confused how.

1866
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:05,590
Hahaha.

1867
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:11,370
I managed to pull best girl Ellen, the shark maid, earlier today while watching her maid cafe vlog.

1868
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:14,890
So I thank you for having brought me the maid luck.

1869
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:15,870
Of course.

1870
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:16,530
Yippee.

1871
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,220
I have mental brain worms.

1872
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:42,520
Hey, stop.

1873
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:43,560
That's my umbrella.

1874
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:44,300
Stop it.

1875
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:45,020
Oh my god.

1876
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,980
She's chewing my umbrella.

1877
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:46,400
Hold on.

1878
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:46,760
Stop.

1879
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:47,200
Hold on.

1880
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:48,320
I'm going to let her out.

1881
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,400
She's being a menace.

1882
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:49,880
Stop.

1883
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:50,940
Oh my god.

1884
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,120
Stop.

1885
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:52,960
Stop it.

1886
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:53,440
Stop.

1887
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,020
You're going to put a hole in my...

1888
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:57,900
She put a hole in my umbrella.

1889
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:58,440
No.

1890
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:01,140
Oh my god.

1891
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:01,480
No.

1892
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,040
She put a hole in my...

1893
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,820
This was my expensive umbrella.

1894
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,320
This was my expensive umbrella.

1895
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:16,440
No.

1896
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,540
That's...

1897
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,800
That's Venom's arm.

1898
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,540
Stop it.

1899
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:20,480
Huh?

1900
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:25,300
Huh?

1901
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:26,960
Huh?

1902
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:30,820
Huh?

1903
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:30,980
Huh?

1904
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,460
She's such a menace.

1905
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:36,300
My umbrella.

1906
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:37,200
No.

1907
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,360
I have umbrella fun.

1908
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:42,280
Thank you.

1909
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:42,940
No.

1910
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,020
You don't have to.

1911
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:51,540
I bought it last time I was in Japan and I got it at like a specialty umbrella store.

1912
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,140
I was like, I'm going to splurge on an umbrella.

1913
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,480
I was like, I'm going to splurge...

1914
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:57,560
Oh.

1915
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:59,980
I'm going to splurge on a nice umbrella.

1916
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,200
Uchu toy.

1917
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:02,500
I mean...

1918
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:02,860
Uchu toy?

1919
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:03,200
I mean umbrella fun.

1920
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:03,720
Uchu toy.

1921
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:04,060
Thank you.

1922
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,840
She was like attacking his arm.

1923
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:09,220
I...

1924
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:09,980
I got some...

1925
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:15,520
I took out like some stuff from a box that was sent to me from OFKAI.

1926
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,200
She's a phantom menace.

1927
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:32,340
Okay.

1928
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,820
I need to do more.

1929
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,120
I need to start building some stuff.

1930
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:37,000
Expensive umbrella.

1931
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,940
Umbrella lost or stolen.

1932
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:41,300
$2 7-Eleven special and I'll have it for life.

1933
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:41,760
I know!

1934
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,320
Right!

1935
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,420
The hall in between events or peek.

1936
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:48,020
Let's see.

1937
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,540
What should we start building?

1938
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,680
Is that her cat?

1939
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:53,600
Yeah, my cat!

1940
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:56,300
My cat's name is Paz.

1941
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:00,200
She's so sweet.

1942
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,920
And also a menace.

1943
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,640
We have some gravel.

1944
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:07,200
Mangrove...

1945
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,220
Am I good on food?

1946
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:14,000
I'm not hungry.

1947
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:14,900
Oh, chest!

1948
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,040
Yeah, it's a good thing.

1949
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:16,460
Chest.

1950
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,880
Let's build that.

1951
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:22,420
We can start storing everything.

1952
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,440
Let's see.

1953
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,420
Once we get some water.

1954
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,680
I swear!

1955
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,460
I remember like before when I played this.

1956
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,540
Things would like... like animals would pop up.

1957
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,140
But we haven't gotten a single animal yet.

1958
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:49,830
A corral for animals.

1959
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:51,730
More platform.

1960
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:53,410
Yeah, I am gonna...

1961
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:56,170
This one is different.

1962
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:07,470
When can we expect to hear you voicing a character?

1963
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:07,810
Milk.

1964
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:10,690
How?

1965
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:11,550
How?

1966
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:13,490
What Metal Gear game?

1967
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:19,330
I haven't been able to catch a lot of your streams live, but your vibes have made lots of work days much more bearable.

1968
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:20,550
So thank you for being so funny.

1969
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:21,370
Also, goodnight, Wisp.

1970
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:23,170
Minto won't tell you this, but you're very cute.

1971
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:25,310
I'll say the Whisper Cue!

1972
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,330
I'll say it!

1973
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:28,870
I'll say it before you!

1974
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:29,970
I said it first.

1975
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:31,270
I said it before Chovek.

1976
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:35,610
I said... I said the Whisper Cue before... before Chovek even ever thought...

1977
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:40,150
Before Chovek even came out the womb, I was thinking that Wisps are so cute.

1978
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:44,010
I said it before you were even a concept.

1979
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:49,570
Before you were even... before you were even implemented into this... into this world.

1980
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:53,170
Thanks, Chovek.

1981
01:27:53,170 --> 01:27:53,410
Goodnight.

1982
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:53,970
No!

1983
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:55,090
No!

1984
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:56,350
Don't thank Chovek!

1985
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:56,710
Thank me!

1986
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:01,970
Where's your loyalty?

1987
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:08,470
Don't thank Chovek!

1988
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:08,810
Don't thank Chovek!

1989
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:12,850
It was my idea to say that Wisps are so cute.

1990
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,560
Always have been.

1991
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,760
Now I kinda wanna take it back.

1992
01:28:25,660 --> 01:28:28,800
When you guys get cocky about it, I kinda wanna take it back.

1993
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:34,060
Okay, let's start building also like... maybe a fence.

1994
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,040
Chovek, my Oshii!

1995
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:39,160
What?

1996
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,300
We're as cute as you?

1997
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,460
Don't insult yourself like that.

1998
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:45,160
Oh my gosh.

1999
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:54,380
Um, fence.

2000
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:02,520
Except the one area we have... for murder.

2001
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:14,870
There we go.

2002
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:19,830
Oh wait, actually we need a few more... for sticks.

2003
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,350
There we go.

2004
01:29:24,830 --> 01:29:25,730
Thirty-three.

2005
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:27,030
That should be... maybe good.

2006
01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:28,830
If I do this.

2007
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:32,590
Now, I'm not just making a pen here.

2008
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:35,650
I'm making like a whole little outline.

2009
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:38,770
This is MY island in the sky.

2010
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:41,890
And no one else is allowed to join.

2011
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:44,810
No one else is allowed in.

2012
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:49,010
No one else can join... well, um...

2013
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,210
Cute as mint, but taller.

2014
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:56,270
But you play Ace Combat 4-5-0-7.

2015
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:58,710
I would like to play more Ace Combat, yes.

2016
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:03,510
But... please be patient.

2017
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:05,690
Because I'm working on other stuff first.

2018
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:08,050
But eventually, yeah.

2019
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:10,290
Not even snakes?

2020
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:11,510
Snakes not coming in!

2021
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:14,570
Oh my gosh, that would be such a great addition.

2022
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:16,950
Not... not solid snake.

2023
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:20,050
But snakes in... in Minecraft will be so fun.

2024
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:22,530
...

2025
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,210
Shorter is better?

2026
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:25,550
You think so?

2027
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:32,310
I think people are always exaggerating my height, though.

2028
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,350
You see...

2029
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:38,190
I am NOT the size of a pinky.

2030
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:41,690
I actually am of... of normal size.

2031
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:57,160
Oh my god, no, he's... he's... he's learning.

2032
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,840
He knows that he can't le... that he... will...

2033
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:01,100
We're good, we're good.

2034
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,120
Okay, push, push.

2035
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:03,140
Push, push, push.

2036
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,020
Push, push.

2037
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:04,780
Push!

2038
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,000
Yeah!

2039
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,440
I'm a pretty average size, I think.

2040
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,760
I don't think it's Culp.

2041
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,020
I think it's, you know...

2042
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:28,760
I think it's normal.

2043
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,320
We're the Shire?

2044
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:42,000
What do you call a cookbook filled with French dessert recipes written by a ghost maid?

2045
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:43,400
A Mont...

2046
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:44,700
Mont...

2047
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,500
Mont Blanc tome.

2048
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,540
You give off such nine centimeter energy.

2049
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:55,600
I don't know why.

2050
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,600
You're standing at virtual vacations as otherwise.

2051
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:08,200
Yeah, but when I'm standing next to two very... or three very tall people, of course the perspective is going to be off.

2052
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:15,660
Minto Baggins.

2053
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,300
Let's see.

2054
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:27,320
Let's create like a ledge of death.

2055
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,190
Ledge of de...

2056
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:57,070
Did something form?

2057
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:58,510
Wait, did you guys see...

2058
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:02,870
Did you guys see something pop up there real quick or am I crazy?

2059
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:05,970
Did you guys see that or...

2060
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:07,530
Am I crazy?

2061
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:19,760
Maybe I'm crazy.

2062
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,260
That means I'm crazy.

2063
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:26,080
Not me, not crazy.

2064
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,310
I'm so brain dead.

2065
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:33,050
I'm so...

2066
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:33,970
You guys, I'm sorry.

2067
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:36,490
I'm sorry for how brain dead I am today.

2068
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:40,570
I've got maybe like three hours of sleep.

2069
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:44,610
Of rested sleep, you know.

2070
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:46,790
Something did pop up but you're still crazy.

2071
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:47,350
Okay, see?

2072
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:48,090
See?

2073
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:49,770
Gman's a real one.

2074
01:33:50,370 --> 01:33:51,030
Telling it...

2075
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:52,250
Telling it as it is.

2076
01:33:52,530 --> 01:33:53,870
Something popped up.

2077
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:55,710
But, you know...

2078
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:05,010
I'm actually loopy.

2079
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:05,970
Herobrine!

2080
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:07,420
They wouldn't put him...

2081
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:11,510
In this.

2082
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:15,450
When am I gonna get stuff though?

2083
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,330
For like...

2084
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:22,590
Like sheep and stuff.

2085
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:24,530
Do I have to trade for the sheep?

2086
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:30,110
I have to get diamonds?

2087
01:34:30,450 --> 01:34:31,730
I have to keep going?

2088
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:35,070
We have to keep digging deeper?

2089
01:34:36,710 --> 01:34:37,790
Or would they?

2090
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:39,870
That's so evil.

2091
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:40,770
They wouldn't do that.

2092
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:43,810
What one block version is this?

2093
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,170
I actually have no idea.

2094
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:48,990
It's very different from the one that I did before.

2095
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,310
I think it's a little...

2096
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:52,470
It feels a little slower.

2097
01:34:59,360 --> 01:34:59,920
Oh!

2098
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:00,300
God!

2099
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:02,180
Oh!

2100
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,660
We can get some string.

2101
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,900
Yeah, it's 1.21.

2102
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:13,520
You're right.

2103
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:13,880
You're right.

2104
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:14,220
You're right.

2105
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:14,500
You're right.

2106
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:15,660
Oh!

2107
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,500
We can order a cow!

2108
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:21,780
Eventually.

2109
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:23,460
Let's get some string though.

2110
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:29,570
What?

2111
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:35,710
Let's order some string.

2112
01:35:37,570 --> 01:35:38,850
And then we murder a man.

2113
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:39,490
Moo!

2114
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:40,310
Alright.

2115
01:35:41,410 --> 01:35:41,850
Alright.

2116
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,660
Keep upgrading, buddy.

2117
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,080
Keep upgrading.

2118
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,200
I know where you're going.

2119
01:35:55,150 --> 01:35:56,330
Order a cow?

2120
01:35:56,710 --> 01:36:00,270
Sounds like a promiscuous website.

2121
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:03,650
Stop moving!

2122
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:05,350
No!

2123
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:07,910
No!

2124
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:11,650
You need to go to the murder... this area.

2125
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:12,370
Come here, come here.

2126
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:13,930
Oh, look, look!

2127
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:14,910
Look, look, look, look!

2128
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:16,630
Something you want to buy!

2129
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:17,790
Come here, come here.

2130
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:19,710
Yeah, yeah.

2131
01:36:22,230 --> 01:36:22,550
No!

2132
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:23,230
No!

2133
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:24,130
He knew what it was!

2134
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,140
Make him walk the plank.

2135
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,760
If I do attack him, will he get angry?

2136
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:37,280
Here we go.

2137
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:38,220
Here we go.

2138
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:39,360
Slowly but surely.

2139
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:43,200
Fine.

2140
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:44,300
We'll leave him for now.

2141
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,080
You missed your chance.

2142
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,680
I was too excited for him to be standing there.

2143
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:54,460
Walk the plank, me hearties.

2144
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,720
But yeah, what did you guys do this weekend?

2145
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:59,300
While I was gone.

2146
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,940
I'm gonna say in advance, too.

2147
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,880
I know tomorrow's my anniversary.

2148
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,600
I don't have much planned, you guys.

2149
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:11,320
I'm really sorry.

2150
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:17,960
It's gonna be kind of... probably... it's kind of disappointing, honestly, because it's like...

2151
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:21,380
my first anniversary, but I have nothing for it.

2152
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,040
An ironically made cafe?

2153
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,320
TFTI, thanks for the invite.

2154
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:32,820
What the hell?

2155
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:38,990
Wait for you to come back.

2156
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:44,800
There he goes.

2157
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,160
Bye!

2158
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:46,360
Bye!

2159
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:55,270
Went to a made cafe at MGS Con.

2160
01:37:56,650 --> 01:38:00,470
Oh, we were gonna make a new shovel.

2161
01:38:13,610 --> 01:38:17,230
Went to a convention and got a tattoo in celebration of someone 9 centimeters...

2162
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:18,910
You guys are obsessed with 9 centimeters!

2163
01:38:18,910 --> 01:38:19,430
9 centimeters...

2164
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:24,930
Is this like a...

2165
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:30,830
Is this like a...

2166
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:40,060
How long is the... I mean...

2167
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:57,220
9 centimeters is plenty?

2168
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,340
I'm not shaming.

2169
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:04,100
It's not... it's not... it's not...

2170
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,320
how much you have, it's how you use it, right?

2171
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:08,960
That's what they always say.

2172
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,140
About any context.

2173
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,600
In any sort of context.

2174
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:18,180
It's not how much you have, it's how you use it.

2175
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,940
I do not...

2176
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:24,800
use it.

2177
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,640
Well then, here are lies.

2178
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:28,400
Don't complain.

2179
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:37,450
I choose to use it for evil.

2180
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:39,090
Now that's just not right.

2181
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,960
Awesome stream today, Mint.

2182
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,920
I'm jump... I'm walking the plank.

2183
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:50,780
I'm walking the plank!

2184
01:39:56,630 --> 01:39:59,710
Oh, now we're finally starting to get hungry a little bit.

2185
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:04,750
And let's make some more...

2186
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:06,090
sticks.

2187
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:08,770
And...

2188
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:10,550
and...

2189
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:11,510
fence.

2190
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:14,490
I didn't mean to do all of it!

2191
01:40:14,730 --> 01:40:15,290
Oh my gosh.

2192
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:16,290
Fence.

2193
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:17,250
Oh yeah.

2194
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:25,350
If you were 9cm would you be OK with being in a jar?

2195
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:27,270
Noooo.

2196
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:31,510
I'm a ghost, and I'm not OK with being in a jar.

2197
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:36,610
You know how, like, there's the little ghost canisters...

2198
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:38,350
that everybody threatens to put me into?

2199
01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:46,250
I'm not OK with that either.

2200
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:50,290
Thinking more of a cage.

2201
01:40:52,190 --> 01:41:15,870
well maybe soon eventually you could put your own Minto in in wherever you like well not within I mean I mean it's you it would be yours I could not stop you but But I would not want to know.

2202
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:23,130
This is not going to happen to Line Up With Ivo.

2203
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:24,650
I had a great time watching some fighting games.

2204
01:41:24,710 --> 01:41:26,650
Speaking of, have you ever played a fighting game?

2205
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:30,110
I think I've like very casually played stuff before.

2206
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:32,050
But nothing ever serious before.

2207
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,260
I wish the rain would stop.

2208
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:51,970
I wish there was a way I could stop the rain.

2209
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:16,590
Because the rain and the sounds are so loud.

2210
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:18,010
I don't like them.

2211
01:42:19,310 --> 01:42:21,290
They make it hard for me to think.

2212
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:25,270
Womp, womp, womp.

2213
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:28,490
Sagu Melon, welcome to membership.

2214
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:29,290
Thank you!

2215
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:32,730
You can turn it down.

2216
01:42:33,090 --> 01:42:33,870
I guess you're right.

2217
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:39,130
I'm not used to Minecraft pausing, you know, when you...

2218
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:40,230
Let's see, weather.

2219
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:42,970
Let's take it down to like 45.

2220
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:45,170
Thank you, thank you.

2221
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:53,230
Into the phantom thermals for you bad ghost.

2222
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:56,830
How's that?

2223
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:59,030
Is it still too loud?

2224
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:11,650
Kind of the same.

2225
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:17,250
Mysterious trader, how did you get in there?

2226
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:20,650
He's like, good question.

2227
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:22,430
We can find a beehive!

2228
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:25,290
Hold on.

2229
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:27,470
Guess who's birthday it is.

2230
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:28,230
Mine!

2231
01:43:29,810 --> 01:43:31,490
Vic Viper, happy birthday!

2232
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:33,650
New emails look awesome.

2233
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:34,210
Thank you, man.

2234
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:34,730
Thank you!

2235
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:40,250
Happy birthday to you.

2236
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:43,570
Happy birthday to you.

2237
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:47,790
Happy birthday, dear Vic Viper.

2238
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:53,810
Happy birthday to you.

2239
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:53,930
Happy birthday to you.

2240
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:58,330
Happy birthday!

2241
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:01,270
20%.

2242
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:03,850
Oh, see, that's better.

2243
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:06,090
Let's also plant some more trees.

2244
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:08,230
Maybe we can get some more...

2245
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:14,630
Actually, I'm just going to turn the overall sound to like 70.

2246
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:19,030
We can do the weather up a little bit more.

2247
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:21,130
Perfect.

2248
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:25,270
The rain is wisps crying because Minto hates us.

2249
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:28,370
Why do you think that?

2250
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:30,690
The trader has two feet of wood between his legs.

2251
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:33,750
The fence?

2252
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:36,010
What do you mean by that?

2253
01:44:38,350 --> 01:44:39,850
Thank you so much for the amazing streams.

2254
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:40,410
You're pretty good.

2255
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:41,730
Thank you!

2256
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:46,690
Let's do some bamboo.

2257
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:46,830
What kind of bamboo?

2258
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:50,370
Let's do some bamboo...

2259
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:52,770
and I can plant that...

2260
01:44:52,770 --> 01:44:54,350
And we can...

2261
01:44:56,230 --> 01:44:59,210
...get that going because that plants well.

2262
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:04,490
We'll replant this like right here, and I am going to keep extending this.

2263
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:07,270
Don't think that just because I put a fence it's like all over.

2264
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:08,290
You know?

2265
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:11,250
In fact...

2266
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:13,250
Huh?

2267
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:15,570
I have a question for you.

2268
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:23,750
When Otacon pisses himself, do you think he changed his pants or he walked around Shadow Moses with pissy pants?

2269
01:45:23,970 --> 01:45:28,210
I think he walked around Shadow Moses... with pissy pants.

2270
01:45:37,450 --> 01:45:38,690
No, I don't need coal.

2271
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:40,290
I don't need coal!

2272
01:45:41,010 --> 01:45:42,650
I want the beehive.

2273
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:44,570
Do I have anymore?

2274
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:48,530
No, I don't have anymore!

2275
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:49,890
Wait!

2276
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:50,990
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2277
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:52,410
Sir?

2278
01:45:52,890 --> 01:45:53,630
Sir?

2279
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:56,890
I will be acquiring your beehive.

2280
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:02,290
I think... oh, nice, it's already growing.

2281
01:46:02,670 --> 01:46:09,510
I think it's quite well known that Otacon doesn't change his pants.

2282
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:13,270
Just kind of goes around...

2283
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:18,030
sopping what... you know?

2284
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:24,860
Throughout all the games?

2285
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:27,920
Every single one.

2286
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,560
Mint, please.

2287
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,000
He's just a pee guy.

2288
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:51,960
I didn't even ask the question.

2289
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:58,940
Alright, what should we build on our little island?

2290
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:04,420
There was one version of the one block that I saw that I kind of wanted to get.

2291
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:06,700
It had like different islands that you could go to.

2292
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:10,180
I think it was a bedrock version.

2293
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:13,500
What is Bro doing over there?

2294
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:16,400
He is staying out of my way.

2295
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:19,460
He's actually in the very best possible place he could be.

2296
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,160
He's staying out of my way.

2297
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,660
He is causing no trouble.

2298
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,240
I think I can get it.

2299
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,280
I think I can get it.

2300
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:36,430
All the little boys are going to come to me!

2301
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:39,710
What's that thing?

2302
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,790
Compost?

2303
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:43,810
I need slabs.

2304
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:44,050
Okay.

2305
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:44,910
Slab.

2306
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:51,030
Compost.

2307
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:58,330
And then we can start putting some stuff in to get bone meal.

2308
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:02,510
Such as...

2309
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:04,290
Ugh.

2310
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:13,530
I can build a cauldron to collect rain?

2311
01:48:13,910 --> 01:48:15,430
Is that what that does?

2312
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:18,370
No way.

2313
01:48:20,590 --> 01:48:23,230
Wait, I just sold all my iron.

2314
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:27,490
You guys, I just sold... We gotta dig.

2315
01:48:31,530 --> 01:48:32,330
The moss!

2316
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:33,770
You're right, the moss.

2317
01:48:33,950 --> 01:48:34,230
The moss.

2318
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,060
It takes a while with the cauldron.

2319
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:50,020
But right now we're not getting anything.

2320
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:51,300
So...

2321
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,940
Might be good.

2322
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:01,700
Mysterious trader new maid cafe employee.

2323
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:05,640
I don't think he's got what it takes.

2324
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,000
His head is really big.

2325
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,600
His head is huge!

2326
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:14,340
Actually...

2327
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,140
Quite is...

2328
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:17,360
He's quite...

2329
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,060
He's got quite a noggin.

2330
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:20,620
Hem.

2331
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:23,570
Hem.

2332
01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:24,950
Let's see.

2333
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:26,590
Let's try growing...

2334
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:28,190
I don't want to grow this.

2335
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:29,050
Well, I do.

2336
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:29,650
But...

2337
01:49:29,650 --> 01:49:32,550
It's just for decoration mostly, so...

2338
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:34,930
If I put it beehive right here...

2339
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:36,150
Will they come?

2340
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:41,660
Do you hear that?

2341
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:57,470
He's working in there!

2342
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:58,110
He's working!

2343
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:01,210
No flowers?

2344
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:02,190
What do you think I'm doing?

2345
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:03,230
What do you think I'm doing?

2346
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:06,110
What do you think I'm doing?

2347
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:06,490
What are you thinking you're doing?

2348
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:07,790
What do you think I'm doing?

2349
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,000
Let me get some more seeds.

2350
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:20,680
There we go, now there's flowers.

2351
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:29,390
More seeds for the compost.

2352
01:50:31,130 --> 01:50:31,690
Perfect.

2353
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:38,310
Come on now!

2354
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:39,910
It's fine!

2355
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:42,990
You hear him?

2356
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:45,330
You hear him?

2357
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:50,890
Everybody okay?

2358
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:05,680
We felt the time skip.

2359
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,240
Something happened with OBS.

2360
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:18,900
Disconnected real quick.

2361
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,000
Alright, starting out a little slow.

2362
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:28,040
Sorry guys, you know, it's been a while since I've played Minecraft.

2363
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:31,540
It's been some time.

2364
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:39,890
But we're getting back into it.

2365
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:42,190
We're getting back into it, baby.

2366
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:45,070
How much was the cauldron?

2367
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:46,670
Ca- ca- cauldron?

2368
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:48,690
Caul... caul... caul...

2369
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,470
Caul... ca...

2370
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:55,250
How do you spell cauldron again?

2371
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:56,030
Am I crazy?

2372
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:03,610
Oh, there we go.

2373
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:04,910
No!

2374
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:07,770
97.

2375
01:52:15,370 --> 01:52:16,490
You guys...

2376
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:17,970
Don't judge me.

2377
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:21,710
Don't judge me.

2378
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:24,470
We got raw...

2379
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:24,730
We...

2380
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:25,570
We got it raw.

2381
01:52:29,070 --> 01:52:30,910
English is hard, okay?

2382
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:32,890
Nice.

2383
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:33,870
More?

2384
01:52:34,570 --> 01:52:40,750
Yeah More, more, more I hear him.

2385
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:42,570
But I think he wants to come out.

2386
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:47,070
I think he wants to come out only when it's daytime.

2387
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:48,230
Okay, whatever.

2388
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:52,270
Instead it's a nice, lovely night.

2389
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:02,140
Unique New York.

2390
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:06,360
You need New York.

2391
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:11,660
Awesome, awesome.

2392
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:13,980
Judgment.

2393
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,000
Okay.

2394
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:28,280
We're making... we're cutting through these.

2395
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:33,420
And we're gonna get some honey.

2396
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:36,020
It's gonna be great for your AGO class.

2397
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,400
My AGO classes.

2398
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:40,960
Stop!

2399
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:42,400
I... I...

2400
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:47,640
I mean, but truly, ghost is my first language, so...

2401
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:52,380
Are you gonna judge someone whose first language is not English?

2402
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:53,660
For speaking...

2403
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,600
Making a mistake in English?

2404
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:02,590
Yes!

2405
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:08,790
You're so mean!

2406
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:16,260
Say something in ghost?

2407
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:17,380
He won't...

2408
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:19,080
You won't understand.

2409
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:21,820
I'll say something, okay.

2410
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,440
I'm gonna teach you guys a curse word.

2411
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:25,940
Okay?

2412
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,800
I'm gonna teach you guys a bad word.

2413
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:29,440
Ready?

2414
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:31,520
One...

2415
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:32,160
Two...

2416
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:37,260
Three...

2417
01:54:37,260 --> 01:54:37,860
Four...

2418
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:38,480
Five...

2419
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:39,780
Six...

2420
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:41,480
Seven...

2422
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:42,700
Ten...

2424
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:50,810

2426
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:53,950

2427
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:54,390
15...

2428
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:54,690
16...

2429
01:54:54,690 --> 01:54:54,850
17...

2430
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:55,350
19...

2431
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:55,570
20...

2432
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:56,350
21...

2433
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:56,490
22...

2434
01:54:56,490 --> 01:54:56,790
23...

2435
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:58,150
24...

2436
01:54:58,150 --> 01:54:58,470
25...

2437
01:54:58,470 --> 01:54:59,670
26...

2438
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:00,310
28...

2439
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:18,480
27...

2440
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:18,760
29...

2441
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:19,740
30...

2442
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:20,040
34...

2443
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:20,180
35...

2444
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:20,220
36...

2445
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:20,260
47...

2446
01:55:20,260 --> 01:55:20,760
48...

2447
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:20,820
50...

2448
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:21,260
55...

2449
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:21,700
68...

2450
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:21,780
68...

2451
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:21,800
39...

2452
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:26,420
40...

2453
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:26,780
41...

2454
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:27,040
45...

2455
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:27,100
46...

2456
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:27,460
46...

2457
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:33,220
44...

2458
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:48,140
48...

2459
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:52,000
Traitor!

2460
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,080
We need to get diamonds.

2461
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:03,580
In light of the foul language, I think I need to give you this before you're demonetized.

2462
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:04,820
No, no, no, it's okay!

2463
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:08,000
That word... what?

2464
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:28,640
Anyway...

2465
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:32,820
I'm curious... I don't...

2466
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:34,900
Is it like one of the things in the...

2467
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:38,540
One of the emojis that you can spam in your guild?

2468
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,320
Anyway...

2469
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:47,180
Cat bunny word...

2470
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:49,780
What?

2471
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:51,440
Cat

2472
01:56:55,310 --> 01:56:55,810
bunny?

2473
01:56:58,820 --> 01:56:59,740
What?

2474
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:00,760
Wait...

2475
01:57:04,940 --> 01:57:06,480
I'm so confused!

2476
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:09,360
You guys confuse me every day!

2477
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:10,700
I don't know what's going on!

2478
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:12,280
I'm so confused!

2479
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,720
I'm so confused!

2480
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:20,460
Please wrap it up!

2481
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:22,080
I'm sorry!

2482
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,700
I don't know!

2483
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:28,900
Move on!

2484
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:32,040
Why am I getting...

2485
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,220
Why am I... Why are people...

2486
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:35,200
Why are you getting...

2487
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:45,770
My weeb card!

2488
01:57:46,530 --> 01:57:47,050
What?

2489
01:57:47,710 --> 01:57:48,230
What?

2490
01:57:49,110 --> 01:57:50,590
Not my weeb card!

2491
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:55,990
If I don't have a weeb card, I have nothing left.

2492
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:59,910
If I don't have a weeb card, what even is my identity?

2493
01:58:02,630 --> 01:58:04,110
What do I even have?

2494
01:58:06,370 --> 01:58:08,090
I need more apples.

2495
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:12,070
We need more apples so we can eat you guys.

2496
01:58:12,330 --> 01:58:14,430
Let's put down the plants again.

2497
01:58:15,770 --> 01:58:18,770
If I don't have a weeb card, I just have...

2498
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:20,850
I don't even know.

2499
01:58:21,950 --> 01:58:22,870
Stink card?

2500
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:24,230
I don't have that either!

2501
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:26,610
You have that.

2502
01:58:27,590 --> 01:58:28,770
You have that.

2503
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:30,590
Don't get it mistaken with me, please.

2504
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:31,130
Thank you.

2505
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:39,060
I have...

2506
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:39,720
Well...

2507
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,520
I was gonna say like I have maybe...

2508
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:44,620
A freak card.

2509
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:48,240
Got my freak card on.

2510
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:57,720
Freaky Minto.

2511
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:00,400
Freak phantom card.

2512
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:04,380
If I made freak phantom cards, would you guys want one?

2513
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:09,680
Back...

2514
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:14,600
Way back when I first opened memberships, the first 44...

2515
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:16,880
Because of course it had to be because it's very spooky.

2516
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:19,600
Got the first people that...

2517
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:22,680
First 44 that joined the memberships got a special card.

2518
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:25,860
Maybe...

2519
01:59:26,370 --> 01:59:26,680
Freak...

2520
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:27,660
Freak...

2521
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:30,000
Too much freak.

2522
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:31,140
Too much freak.

2523
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:32,100
Not enough phantom.

2524
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:34,660
The V card?

2525
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:35,420
Wait...

2526
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:36,560
Clearly you mean the...

2527
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,940
Who's saying V card?

2528
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:40,660
What's wrong with you guys today?

2529
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,000
You guys are so freaky.

2530
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:45,870
Um...

2531
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:47,810
But uh...

2532
01:59:49,190 --> 01:59:52,610
Maybe if I brought those back and did the same thing.

2533
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:53,590
First 44.

2534
01:59:56,310 --> 01:59:59,790
I remember who got the first one and the first one before.

2535
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:03,090
They're sometimes still in the chat.

2536
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:06,910
They're sometimes still in the chat.

2537
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:10,390
What do you want?

2538
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:22,550
Is it me?

2539
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:23,730
No.

2540
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:31,150
So jealous of the OGs...

2541
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:32,450
What's there to be jealous of?

2542
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:35,610
What I was thinking was the first 44.

2543
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:36,290
Oh, sorry.

2544
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:37,570
I don't think I finished my sentence.

2545
02:00:37,690 --> 02:00:38,970
The first 44...

2546
02:00:38,970 --> 02:00:40,410
Would get it...

2547
02:00:40,410 --> 02:00:41,770
Their name filled out.

2548
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:43,550
By Watashi.

2549
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:48,210
And then...

2550
02:00:48,210 --> 02:00:49,750
But obviously, there would be more.

2551
02:00:51,190 --> 02:00:55,090
But the first 44 would be the ones that...

2552
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:55,650
I get it.

2553
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:58,370
With the handwritten.

2554
02:00:58,630 --> 02:00:59,250
I don't know.

2555
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:00,250
It's just a thought.

2556
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:01,790
Maybe.

2557
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:05,050
But having freak phantom cards would be kind of fun.

2558
02:01:07,050 --> 02:01:08,790
But you already opened memberships.

2559
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:11,730
No, it wouldn't be a membership thing.

2560
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:12,330
It would be...

2561
02:01:12,330 --> 02:01:12,550
Oh!

2562
02:01:12,650 --> 02:01:13,670
Food, food, food, food!

2563
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:15,010
Oh, I forgot about my food!

2564
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:16,510
Wait, don't steal any of my food!

2565
02:01:17,910 --> 02:01:19,350
He literally exploded.

2566
02:01:19,770 --> 02:01:20,490
Wait, where is he?

2567
02:01:24,830 --> 02:01:25,370
You're okay.

2568
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:27,830
Hmm...

2569
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:29,050
We could get a slime ball.

2570
02:01:30,030 --> 02:01:30,990
We could get bone.

2571
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:32,290
We don't need the bone.

2572
02:01:32,450 --> 02:01:33,370
We don't need any of this.

2573
02:01:34,050 --> 02:01:34,890
Go, go, go.

2574
02:01:35,630 --> 02:01:36,230
Go, go.

2575
02:01:37,230 --> 02:01:37,930
Please leave.

2576
02:01:38,170 --> 02:01:39,550
Please vacate the premises.

2577
02:01:44,110 --> 02:01:45,190
Spruce for podzol.

2578
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:46,690
I have spruce though.

2579
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:50,390
What is a podzol good for?

2580
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:52,490
Is this bee ever coming out?

2581
02:01:56,370 --> 02:01:57,750
Wait, I don't hear him anymore.

2582
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:07,330
Oh, I hear him.

2583
02:02:07,390 --> 02:02:07,710
Okay, okay.

2584
02:02:08,530 --> 02:02:09,390
He's still in there.

2585
02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:09,790
I hear him.

2586
02:02:09,810 --> 02:02:10,190
I hear him.

2587
02:02:12,230 --> 02:02:13,110
He's still in there.

2588
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:13,710
He's still in there.

2589
02:02:33,390 --> 02:02:35,450
It's not that the anime fest schedule is out.

2590
02:02:35,470 --> 02:02:36,930
Your schedule for the con is packed.

2591
02:02:37,650 --> 02:02:38,510
You're telling me.

2592
02:02:40,030 --> 02:02:40,750
I know.

2593
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:41,530
It's crazy.

2594
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:47,040
I know.

2595
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:49,700
That's why I was just like, oh gosh, if I don't make it.

2596
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:52,540
Crazy, crazy.

2597
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:54,260
It's waiting to jump scare you.

2598
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,560
It's a booby.

2599
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:01,990
Okay.

2600
02:03:06,210 --> 02:03:09,070
You have an event or two each day.

2601
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:09,510
It's insane.

2602
02:03:09,870 --> 02:03:13,030
Yeah, I'm going to still try and put out a schedule for this week.

2603
02:03:13,170 --> 02:03:18,210
But I'm going to be basically streaming in between events of the convention.

2604
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:23,150
So it's a little crazy.

2605
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:28,330
But yeah, I'll be there.

2606
02:03:30,210 --> 02:03:32,010
And I'll be streaming also.

2607
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:36,050
What was I going to do?

2608
02:03:36,170 --> 02:03:37,030
Oh, make a...

2609
02:03:37,030 --> 02:03:39,670
We need another pickaxe.

2610
02:03:42,430 --> 02:03:44,170
I don't need this guy to leave.

2611
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,870
I need to get this guy to get out of my hair.

2612
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:47,870
If I kill him, will he be upset?

2613
02:03:50,190 --> 02:03:50,610
Huh?

2614
02:03:50,950 --> 02:03:53,170
Dead man tell no tales.

2615
02:03:55,290 --> 02:03:55,710
Oh!

2616
02:03:57,130 --> 02:03:58,210
Kill the villager.

2617
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:02,250
I got an achievement!

2618
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:08,490
So what did I bet?

2619
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:11,190
I see that means I hadn't killed them before ever.

2620
02:04:11,450 --> 02:04:12,750
Make sure to get some rest too.

2621
02:04:12,990 --> 02:04:13,630
I will.

2622
02:04:14,050 --> 02:04:15,030
Thank you.

2623
02:04:15,830 --> 02:04:17,570
That means I never killed him before.

2624
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:19,950
That was my first murder.

2625
02:04:20,650 --> 02:04:21,790
I've tasted blood.

2626
02:04:23,050 --> 02:04:24,890
Do you think they're going to raise the prices?

2627
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:27,930
You think they're going to get upset?

2628
02:04:28,450 --> 02:04:30,230
Oh, we're so close to 500.

2629
02:04:30,390 --> 02:04:31,710
That means we might get a new...

2630
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:33,190
We might get a new block.

2631
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:34,550
Please.

2632
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:39,200
Step five.

2633
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:42,580
Alright.

2634
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:44,500
New season.

2635
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:45,540
Nice murder meantime.

2636
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:46,200
Thank you.

2637
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:49,140
What are we...

2638
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:49,360
Oh!

2639
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:51,620
We're on to...

2640
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:54,260
Andesai!

2641
02:04:58,550 --> 02:04:59,790
Not counting the baby.

2642
02:05:00,050 --> 02:05:02,150
The baby was not murder.

2643
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:03,530
The baby was not murder.

2644
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:04,770
The baby was not murder.

2645
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:04,810
The baby was not murder.

2646
02:05:04,810 --> 02:05:05,070
Though...

2647
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:06,670
It could have been.

2648
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:15,440
The baby was a freak accident.

2649
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,780
The baby was self-defense.

2650
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:23,660
I can't believe I ran over a baby this morning.

2651
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:29,240
I missed out on getting a meet and greet ticket.

2652
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:30,640
But I'm looking forward to seeing you at VEXPO.

2653
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:31,340
Yeah!

2654
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:35,000
Well, if you go to the Minto meet up.

2655
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:36,220
Which I believe...

2656
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:37,920
Is a...

2657
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:39,580
Sunday...

2658
02:05:40,240 --> 02:05:40,680
Afternoon.

2659
02:05:58,430 --> 02:06:00,010
Is this one gonna grow back?

2660
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:06,380
Or do I have to plant it?

2661
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:09,460
I think I have to plant it.

2662
02:06:14,180 --> 02:06:15,860
I wonder if I can make some...

2663
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:17,240
Bad guys appear.

2664
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:21,120
Let's build out a little bit more.

2665
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:22,000
Let's expand.

2666
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:25,040
Domain...

2667
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:25,920
Expansion!

2668
02:06:27,780 --> 02:06:30,160
I'm acting like I watched...

2669
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:32,580
Gojo's Bizarre Adventure.

2670
02:07:01,630 --> 02:07:02,370
There we go.

2671
02:07:03,550 --> 02:07:04,290
Look at that.

2672
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:07,870
And we're gonna turn this into our pet play area.

2673
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:10,590
This is the pet world.

2674
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:12,090
Right here.

2675
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:12,750
Oh.

2676
02:07:12,890 --> 02:07:13,890
Just not that.

2677
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:17,110
Here.

2678
02:07:17,770 --> 02:07:19,290
Chup-chup-chup-chup-chup-chup.

2679
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:22,110
They'll have plenty of room to walk...

2680
02:07:22,110 --> 02:07:22,450
Probably.

2681
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:25,630
Eventually...

2682
02:07:27,370 --> 02:07:27,950
And...

2683
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:34,870
What did I say?

2684
02:07:36,590 --> 02:07:37,610
What did I say?

2685
02:07:38,730 --> 02:07:40,450
They're all heaven and earth, atenção.

2686
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:41,510
Thank you.

2687
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:45,210
What did I say now?

2688
02:07:51,590 --> 02:07:52,870
No I didn't.

2689
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:59,550
You made an area specifically for pet play.

2690
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:04,810
What is... is that weird?

2691
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:05,450
Pet play?

2692
02:08:05,630 --> 02:08:08,090
I was thinking... I said the pet play area.

2693
02:08:11,090 --> 02:08:12,590
It's a playpen for pets!

2694
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:13,310
Yeah, exactly!

2695
02:08:13,670 --> 02:08:14,330
What did I say?

2696
02:08:14,330 --> 02:08:14,630
Hey!

2697
02:08:17,470 --> 02:08:18,890
I'm just gonna... I'm just...

2698
02:08:18,890 --> 02:08:20,230
You guys, this is it.

2699
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:22,790
I'm leaving all my stuff to you.

2700
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:25,290
Goodbye cruel world.

2701
02:08:26,370 --> 02:08:27,950
Goodbye cruel world.

2702
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:32,450
I don't wanna live... I don't wanna live on this planet anymore.

2703
02:08:32,710 --> 02:08:33,590
Something, something.

2704
02:08:34,670 --> 02:08:37,210
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

2705
02:08:38,070 --> 02:08:39,390
Wait, I need another chest.

2706
02:08:42,450 --> 02:08:43,630
But you're not living.

2707
02:08:44,330 --> 02:08:45,110
I am in Minecraft.

2708
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:47,950
I don't wanna live in Minecraft anymore.

2709
02:08:50,850 --> 02:08:52,990
If I die, I wonder what happens.

2710
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:57,390
Haruka!

2711
02:08:57,630 --> 02:08:58,390
Thanks for the gift!

2712
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:05,980
Why does chat know this?

2713
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:09,200
Chat knows a lot of things that I don't really understand.

2714
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:16,890
Dual flip!

2715
02:09:21,150 --> 02:09:21,590
Oh!

2716
02:09:21,790 --> 02:09:23,210
We're getting some of this other stuff too.

2717
02:09:32,050 --> 02:09:32,690
Oh!

2718
02:09:32,690 --> 02:09:33,330
Diorite.

2719
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:39,280
It's Freaky Tuesday.

2720
02:09:40,140 --> 02:09:42,240
Please forgive the dehydrated ones.

2721
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:45,960
Again.

2722
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:49,800
I kind of mentioned this somewhat recently.

2723
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:55,240
How like, you know, sometimes when I tell my friends who are completely out of the vtuber sphere.

2724
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:59,700
Just like sometimes things that are said to me or said in chat.

2725
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:02,640
They'll be like...

2726
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:03,860
Oh my god.

2727
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:04,900
Like, girl!

2728
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:06,760
Get out of there, girl!

2729
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:09,160
They'll be like...

2730
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:09,820
Why?

2731
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:11,600
Why do you tolerate this?

2732
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:14,340
And I think my brain is seriously like...

2733
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:16,180
I think I'm just seriously like...

2734
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:19,480
So desensitized to things now.

2735
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:21,580
It's pretty bad.

2736
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:25,440
It's kind of like when you go on Twitter in public and you're just like...

2737
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:27,000
You're so used to seeing...

2738
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,060
You know...

2739
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:29,600
Um...

2740
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:31,000
Like...

2741
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:32,320
I don't know...

2742
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:34,680
Anime boobies on your timeline.

2743
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:35,760
You just think it's normal.

2744
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,100
Then you go out in public and you're just like...

2745
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:38,300
Oh wait.

2746
02:10:39,060 --> 02:10:39,640
This is...

2747
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,180
This is...

2748
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:42,100
This is not what normal people look at.

2749
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:44,780
You know?

2750
02:10:49,710 --> 02:10:50,950
Oh, that's me.

2751
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:55,110
Did someone say boobies?

2752
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:08,450
So it's kind of funny just when I hear their perspective on things.

2753
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:09,690
How they're just like...

2754
02:11:09,690 --> 02:11:10,330
What?

2755
02:11:10,410 --> 02:11:11,290
What are you doing?

2756
02:11:11,490 --> 02:11:13,470
Oh, I thought that said order a ghost!

2757
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:15,470
Wait, a goat?

2758
02:11:17,170 --> 02:11:18,030
A pig!

2759
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:22,110
We can get gum powder.

2760
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:29,320
I'm used to seeing people unconscious with blood on them.

2761
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:35,940
Order a ghost!

2762
02:11:36,580 --> 02:11:38,280
It's called a Luigi board.

2763
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:42,380
Our own freaky ghost maid?

2764
02:11:42,580 --> 02:11:42,720
No.

2765
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:44,820
No, sorry.

2766
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:46,320
That's one of a kind.

2767
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:48,580
Genuine one of a kind.

2768
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:52,340
Huh?

2769
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:54,120
Huh?

2770
02:11:54,580 --> 02:11:54,860
Huh?

2771
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:01,020
Are you ordering a minto?

2772
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:02,960
Hmm...

2773
02:12:04,420 --> 02:12:06,500
I don't think I need anything here.

2774
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:09,680
Maybe the cactus we could try getting.

2775
02:12:13,530 --> 02:12:14,010
Um...

2776
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:14,770
How much...

2777
02:12:14,770 --> 02:12:15,850
How much of...

2778
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:17,250
Iron?

2779
02:12:17,390 --> 02:12:18,250
Oh, I have quite a bit.

2780
02:12:20,290 --> 02:12:21,850
Now we can be cooking up.

2781
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:25,870
Whatcha doing over here?

2782
02:12:26,150 --> 02:12:26,630
Contemplating?

2783
02:12:34,610 --> 02:12:36,530
Look how cute our area is though.

2784
02:12:36,690 --> 02:12:37,010
Right?

2785
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:40,770
We got so much nice stuff here.

2786
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:43,390
We don't even need a house.

2787
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:45,150
We're better than that.

2788
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:47,290
And now we're getting clay?

2789
02:12:47,350 --> 02:12:47,390
Yeah.

2790
02:12:47,390 --> 02:12:48,370
We got clay and stuff too.

2791
02:12:48,670 --> 02:12:50,070
What should I build next you guys?

2792
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:51,150
What should I build next?

2793
02:12:51,410 --> 02:12:52,730
Oh, my tummy is starting to hurt.

2794
02:12:53,290 --> 02:12:54,810
Why is my tummy starting to hurt?

2795
02:12:55,070 --> 02:12:55,330
Oh -hoo!

2796
02:12:56,510 --> 02:12:57,850
What shaders do you have?

2797
02:12:59,170 --> 02:12:59,610
Nod.

2798
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:06,430
Build a big shell.

2799
02:13:09,850 --> 02:13:11,930
Oh, we're getting minecraft music again.

2800
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:21,820
Do you like it better without shaders?

2801
02:13:22,220 --> 02:13:24,340
See, I like minecraft with shaders.

2802
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:24,520
Next.

2803
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:26,440
But I like it when it's not like...

2804
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:30,580
When it makes like the clouds and everything too realistic, I'm like, no!

2805
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:33,500
I kind of like it better when it's...

2806
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:39,140
You know, the clouds are still like this, but it just adds a little bit of ambient lighting.

2807
02:13:41,780 --> 02:13:43,160
Very lightweight shaders.

2808
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:43,980
Yeah, yeah!

2809
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:46,600
It just adds a little bit.

2810
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:51,040
I prefer it a bit cartoony.

2811
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:55,760
Yeah, like there's some that make the grass and everything so realistic.

2812
02:13:56,020 --> 02:13:56,740
And I'm like...

2813
02:13:56,740 --> 02:13:58,440
Nah, I don't need that.

2814
02:13:58,640 --> 02:13:59,240
I just wanna...

2815
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:01,420
You know, I wanna have like... again...

2816
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:04,260
The lighting to have like...

2817
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:06,860
Some pretty colors...

2818
02:14:09,220 --> 02:14:11,180
Even sometimes the water...

2819
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:11,480
Oh yeah!

2820
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:13,240
We gotta make our cauldron!

2821
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,220
Okay, now...

2822
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:28,100
Now we will be collecting water.

2823
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:29,260
Right here.

2824
02:14:34,810 --> 02:14:35,570
Okay.

2825
02:14:35,930 --> 02:14:36,690
Nice.

2826
02:14:38,150 --> 02:14:39,310
Alright guys!

2827
02:14:39,530 --> 02:14:41,390
Very good, very good!

2828
02:14:43,490 --> 02:14:46,070
Just trying to think of what are the things I could build.

2829
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:50,130
Let's start...

2830
02:14:50,630 --> 02:14:53,310
Throwing more moss into here.

2831
02:14:54,530 --> 02:14:56,690
I'm gonna need food soon.

2832
02:14:59,030 --> 02:15:00,010
I'm gonna need...

2833
02:15:00,670 --> 02:15:02,050
I'm gonna need foo- Bye-bye.

2834
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:04,190
I'm gonna starve in Minecraft!

2835
02:15:07,650 --> 02:15:08,170
Chuu!

2836
02:15:08,510 --> 02:15:09,030
Chuu!

2837
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:15,520
I wrote a poem...

2838
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:19,400
To immortalize a good friend that I met at Off-Kai.

2839
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:22,180
Okay.

2840
02:15:22,420 --> 02:15:23,620
What is a wisp?

2841
02:15:23,820 --> 02:15:26,220
I think I saw one run past me just now.

2842
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:28,880
How another could love someone...

2843
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:38,760
Part 1.

2844
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:39,940
Out of FOUR?!

2845
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:41,300
Amelia?

2846
02:15:44,740 --> 02:15:46,520
You really put some thought into this.

2847
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:53,850
Out of four?!

2848
02:15:54,910 --> 02:15:55,870
Bro's been cooking.

2849
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:57,870
You've been really thinking about this.

2850
02:15:58,070 --> 02:15:59,630
Ofukai was a couple months ago.

2851
02:16:01,430 --> 02:16:02,470
Part 2.

2852
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:05,970
Seventeen seconds ago, we caught a tweet from her.

2853
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:08,470
Stuff for anyone still at Ofukai.

2854
02:16:08,650 --> 02:16:09,930
I couldn't do it though.

2855
02:16:10,070 --> 02:16:10,850
But he could.

2856
02:16:11,010 --> 02:16:12,890
For I was not the strongest wisp.

2857
02:16:13,070 --> 02:16:14,010
But he could.

2858
02:16:14,230 --> 02:16:16,810
He became smaller and smaller down the street.

2859
02:16:17,010 --> 02:16:18,690
And I was sure it was destiny.

2860
02:16:23,780 --> 02:16:25,260
You really felt so moved.

2861
02:16:25,340 --> 02:16:26,160
What's the next part?

2862
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:27,480
What happens next?

2863
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:29,780
What happens next?!

2864
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:32,620
I'm invested now.

2865
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:33,080
Me too!

2866
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:38,380
The suspense!

2867
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:41,020
Don't leave me hanging!

2868
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:42,560
When do they kiss?

2869
02:16:42,720 --> 02:16:43,940
I'm kind of shipping them.

2870
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:44,520
I'm not going to lie.

2871
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:46,080
Part 3.

2872
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:52,440
He would win a mint card because he was the strongest wisp.

2873
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:56,040
He would make it from the crowd to the Hyatt.

2874
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:58,800
And of course, he'd win our Oshis offerings.

2875
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:01,500
But ten minutes later, and I was there too.

2876
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:05,200
And... it's on a cliffhanger!

2877
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:08,860
It's on a cliffhanger!

2878
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:11,120
And what?

2879
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:13,440
And what?!

2880
02:17:25,130 --> 02:17:26,130
Oh my god.

2881
02:17:28,610 --> 02:17:29,930
And then we kissed.

2882
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:37,300
Wait until next month for part 2.

2883
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:43,620
I'm expanding so I can put in more trees too.

2884
02:17:47,960 --> 02:17:49,880
It wasn't meant to be now!

2885
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:56,860
It wasn't wispily possible to be a half mile head start.

2886
02:17:57,140 --> 02:17:59,400
And I remember that destiny isn't real.

2887
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:03,040
But a few seconds later when I saw him again, he held up his phone.

2888
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:05,580
And he was in the center of her new tweet.

2889
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:07,840
I tagged it.

2890
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:31,040
Oh my gosh.

2891
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:33,020
No, destiny is real!

2892
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:36,400
What's so funny?

2893
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:39,860
I liked it.

2894
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:41,620
That's why it was funny.

2895
02:18:43,660 --> 02:18:46,140
You don't laugh at things that you really like?

2896
02:18:49,300 --> 02:18:51,740
Did I grab everything I needed from this guy?

2897
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:54,780
That's kind of expensive.

2898
02:18:54,780 --> 02:18:57,380
15 iron ingots for a cactus?

2899
02:18:57,840 --> 02:18:58,920
Or for 8 cactus?

2900
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:06,800
Okay, get out of here.

2901
02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:11,300
I think I laugh too much, you guys.

2902
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:13,680
I think I'm laughing all the time.

2903
02:19:18,540 --> 02:19:20,500
That was beautiful, Amelia.

2904
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:24,340
Hopefully next time is your chance to get the sign.

2905
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:25,800
If you really want it.

2906
02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:35,380
We laugh and we grow fat here.

2907
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:36,180
True!

2908
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:42,500
Don't mind me just rolling the Chu gacha.

2909
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:45,540
You failed, I'm sorry.

2910
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:48,120
You failed, I'm sorry.

2911
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:51,900
I procrastinated so hard writing this.

2912
02:19:52,020 --> 02:19:53,500
I had it done a few weeks ago.

2913
02:19:53,540 --> 02:19:56,340
I spent way too much time trying to work up the courage to send it.

2914
02:19:56,860 --> 02:19:57,940
I'm glad you liked it.

2915
02:19:58,020 --> 02:19:58,940
I hope he does too.

2916
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:01,320
He's probably so honored.

2917
02:20:05,790 --> 02:20:07,390
I'm glad you felt so inspired.

2918
02:20:10,090 --> 02:20:11,790
No such thing as too much laughter.

2919
02:20:13,130 --> 02:20:15,290
Sometimes I worry people will take it the wrong way.

2920
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:18,170
And sometimes I just...

2921
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:20,410
There he goes.

2922
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:24,290
Sometimes I just laugh because I like something so much, you know?

2923
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:26,430
I'm not laughing in like a...

2924
02:20:26,430 --> 02:20:27,650
This sucks.

2925
02:20:27,910 --> 02:20:28,910
I'm laughing in like a...

2926
02:20:28,910 --> 02:20:29,490
Wow.

2927
02:20:30,190 --> 02:20:31,330
That was just so great.

2928
02:20:31,450 --> 02:20:33,270
I have no words, but I must laugh.

2929
02:20:35,730 --> 02:20:38,350
Going to Japan several months after I made Cafe Rex.

2930
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:40,190
I'm looking forward to checking them out.

2931
02:20:41,550 --> 02:20:42,070
Yeah!

2932
02:20:42,070 --> 02:20:43,150
Have fun, Seymour!

2933
02:20:45,170 --> 02:20:47,950
What about the Tutoroo gacha you mentioned a few streams ago?

2934
02:20:54,630 --> 02:20:55,650
It's like...

2935
02:20:57,010 --> 02:20:57,930
Ultra rare.

2936
02:20:58,210 --> 02:20:59,310
One in a million.

2937
02:21:01,730 --> 02:21:02,810
One in a million.

2938
02:21:12,610 --> 02:21:14,450
I have no words, but I must laugh.

2939
02:21:14,650 --> 02:21:15,110
Hehehe.

2940
02:21:16,150 --> 02:21:17,050
Uh-oh, you guys.

2941
02:21:17,090 --> 02:21:17,770
We need more food.

2942
02:21:18,190 --> 02:21:19,470
Okay, let's start planting trees.

2943
02:21:21,350 --> 02:21:22,030
Tree time!

2944
02:21:23,730 --> 02:21:25,130
One in a mint million.

2945
02:21:26,590 --> 02:21:27,010
Exactly.

2946
02:21:29,150 --> 02:21:29,570
Grow!

2947
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:30,730
Grow!

2948
02:21:30,850 --> 02:21:31,250
Grow!

2949
02:21:31,490 --> 02:21:32,090
Uh-oh.

2950
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:33,250
Guys, we're going to starve!

2951
02:21:33,490 --> 02:21:34,170
We're going to starve!

2952
02:21:34,810 --> 02:21:36,190
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

2953
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:37,590
Okay, don't panic.

2954
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:38,110
Don't...

2955
02:21:38,110 --> 02:21:38,530
Everybody...

2956
02:21:38,530 --> 02:21:39,370
Stop panicking.

2957
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:40,870
Stop panicking!

2958
02:21:41,050 --> 02:21:42,590
You guys are making me panic, okay?

2959
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:43,490
Stop panicking.

2960
02:21:43,490 --> 02:21:45,170
Thank you, thank you.

2961
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:45,810
Bye!

2962
02:21:46,170 --> 02:21:46,550
Bye!

2963
02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:51,210
Tutoroo gacha...

2964
02:21:53,470 --> 02:21:54,530
Don't even try!

2965
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:55,470
It's too rare!

2966
02:21:56,110 --> 02:21:56,730
Oh!

2967
02:21:57,090 --> 02:21:58,490
Don't test your luck!

2968
02:21:58,610 --> 02:21:59,270
It's too rare!

2969
02:22:01,650 --> 02:22:02,690
I'm panicking.

2970
02:22:02,950 --> 02:22:04,090
No, you're panicking.

2971
02:22:04,230 --> 02:22:04,970
I'm not panicking.

2972
02:22:10,650 --> 02:22:11,270
Too...

2973
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:12,130
Oh my god, stop!

2974
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:15,070
Hey!

2975
02:22:15,070 --> 02:22:15,110
Hey!

2976
02:22:16,910 --> 02:22:18,410
I've never been more calm.

2977
02:22:21,970 --> 02:22:22,650
Let's start.

2978
02:22:22,750 --> 02:22:23,310
Let's start.

2979
02:22:23,450 --> 02:22:24,270
Okay, apples.

2980
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:27,670
You're the apple of my eye.

2981
02:22:30,430 --> 02:22:32,450
My mom said I'm one in a million.

2982
02:22:34,170 --> 02:22:35,850
And I'm sure she meant that.

2983
02:22:37,010 --> 02:22:39,270
You're just so unique and special.

2984
02:22:41,410 --> 02:22:43,530
Possessed to push my lucks.

2985
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:44,930
Get out of here!

2986
02:22:45,290 --> 02:22:46,530
Get out of here!

2987
02:22:48,850 --> 02:22:50,770
You'll never find it!

2988
02:22:50,990 --> 02:22:54,450
I'll leave the Tutoroo in one piece.

2989
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:03,480
I'll leave the Tutoroo in one piece.

2990
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:26,660
Stealth camouflage.

2991
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:28,520
You guys, there's no apples.

2992
02:23:29,220 --> 02:23:29,860
Don't you...

2993
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:30,820
Why don't you sell food?

2994
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:33,140
Why don't you sell food, mysterious?

2995
02:23:33,140 --> 02:23:33,620
Serious?

2996
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:34,580
Traitor?

2997
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:35,080
Why?

2998
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:37,540
We're gonna starve!

2999
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:38,280
We're gonna starve!

3000
02:23:45,610 --> 02:23:46,890
Let's just keep digging.

3001
02:23:52,250 --> 02:23:53,330
Plant the seeds.

3002
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:54,650
No, I don't have any water!

3003
02:23:55,150 --> 02:23:56,370
I can't plant them!

3004
02:23:56,670 --> 02:23:57,610
I have no water!

3005
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:00,430
They won't grow!

3006
02:24:02,970 --> 02:24:04,110
What's this Wii?

3007
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:06,950
This is always a team play game!

3008
02:24:07,930 --> 02:24:08,470
It's...

3009
02:24:08,470 --> 02:24:09,030
You guys!

3010
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:10,390
I...

3011
02:24:10,390 --> 02:24:11,150
You are me!

3012
02:24:12,470 --> 02:24:13,590
We are Wii!

3013
02:24:13,950 --> 02:24:15,030
We're a team!

3014
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:16,830
There's no I in team!

3015
02:24:17,630 --> 02:24:19,450
It's always been us!

3016
02:24:19,970 --> 02:24:22,850
I always consider you part of the team.

3017
02:24:22,990 --> 02:24:24,490
We're all together in this.

3018
02:24:24,550 --> 02:24:26,050
We're all complicit in any crime.

3019
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:30,010
I am literally Minto.

3020
02:24:30,410 --> 02:24:34,290
That's what you said when I possessed your mom last night.

3021
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:40,000
I don't think that made much sense.

3022
02:24:57,690 --> 02:24:58,950
I think I...

3023
02:24:59,910 --> 02:25:01,570
I appreciate the effort.

3024
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:04,070
I think I could have botched that one.

3025
02:25:08,430 --> 02:25:12,550
What I meant to say was...

3026
02:25:13,130 --> 02:25:14,450
I think it's dead.

3027
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:16,510
You know what?

3028
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:20,050
I'm not even going to attempt to say what I was trying to say.

3029
02:25:20,230 --> 02:25:21,050
The joke...

3030
02:25:21,050 --> 02:25:22,090
The bit is dead.

3031
02:25:26,970 --> 02:25:33,050
Just like the fans said to Konami, the bit is dead and you're the ones who killed it.

3032
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:35,850
Good one, Minto.

3033
02:25:35,970 --> 02:25:37,010
I don't want to hear it from you.

3034
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:51,220
Alright, let's grab another.

3035
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:57,680
Another thing.

3036
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:58,960
Another shovel.

3037
02:25:59,540 --> 02:26:02,320
Okay, before I was like, no rain, please.

3038
02:26:02,420 --> 02:26:03,100
Anyway, please.

3039
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:05,000
Now I'm like, please rain.

3040
02:26:05,140 --> 02:26:05,920
Please rain.

3041
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:10,000
And this is why you're our Oshii.

3042
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:11,760
Why do you have the clown emoji?

3043
02:26:14,140 --> 02:26:14,860
There too.

3044
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:16,880
Tyler, welcome to membership.

3045
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:18,140
Thank you!

3046
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:22,060
Why do you have the clown emoji?

3047
02:26:30,830 --> 02:26:31,870
Gonna starve.

3048
02:26:38,170 --> 02:26:39,930
The bees aren't coming out.

3049
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:43,070
If I take this down, do they...

3050
02:26:45,570 --> 02:26:47,290
Does it destroy it?

3051
02:26:47,350 --> 02:26:47,890
I can't remember.

3052
02:26:56,150 --> 02:26:56,930
Okay, nice.

3053
02:26:58,990 --> 02:27:04,230
Got lots and lots of bamboo, which means we can make lots of string and we can also make lots of bamboo thingies.

3054
02:27:06,450 --> 02:27:06,930
Bamboo.

3055
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:09,230
Block of bamboo.

3056
02:27:10,450 --> 02:27:11,470
That's kind of expensive.

3057
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:13,130
Oh.

3058
02:27:15,530 --> 02:27:16,170
Uh-oh.

3059
02:27:16,230 --> 02:27:16,730
Uh-oh.

3060
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:18,130
You guys, I can't run anymore.

3061
02:27:18,330 --> 02:27:19,090
I'm too hungry.

3062
02:27:19,830 --> 02:27:23,130
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3063
02:27:23,450 --> 02:27:25,290
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

3064
02:27:26,310 --> 02:27:26,770
Bamboo.

3065
02:27:29,570 --> 02:27:31,230
Oh no, no, no.

3066
02:27:32,670 --> 02:27:34,350
Oh no, no, no.

3067
02:27:35,570 --> 02:27:37,070
I want to make more bamboo.

3068
02:27:37,390 --> 02:27:37,970
Oh, here.

3069
02:27:39,470 --> 02:27:39,930
Oh.

3070
02:27:44,990 --> 02:27:46,530
Are we gonna die?

3071
02:27:47,870 --> 02:27:49,010
Are we gonna die?

3072
02:27:57,700 --> 02:27:59,760
Eat him for sustenance.

3073
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:03,880
The trees do not bear fruit.

3074
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:07,640
The winters are long and cold.

3075
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:12,760
The animals have abandoned us.

3076
02:28:17,700 --> 02:28:19,140
I think...

3077
02:28:20,980 --> 02:28:22,680
I think this might be it.

3078
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:25,120
Our small journey.

3079
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:32,040
Oh gosh, I really hope it doesn't drop an apple over the edge.

3080
02:28:36,550 --> 02:28:38,630
This might be it for us.

3081
02:28:39,730 --> 02:28:40,270
Everybody.

3082
02:28:42,450 --> 02:28:43,350
An apple.

3083
02:28:43,810 --> 02:28:44,630
An apple.

3084
02:28:48,390 --> 02:28:48,930
Sustenance.

3085
02:28:49,130 --> 02:28:49,670
Sustenance.

3086
02:28:49,990 --> 02:28:50,970
We can get more.

3087
02:28:51,670 --> 02:28:52,290
Food!

3088
02:28:59,170 --> 02:29:00,410
We need water.

3089
02:29:06,860 --> 02:29:09,340
Just a little... a little to hold us over.

3090
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:12,360
We can make it.

3091
02:29:13,260 --> 02:29:15,280
We can make it together, everybody.

3092
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,380
Believe.

3093
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:18,760
Believe.

3094
02:29:22,270 --> 02:29:23,440
And if not...

3095
02:29:28,110 --> 02:29:30,590
I've never tried brains before.

3096
02:29:33,230 --> 02:29:33,910
Okay, hold on.

3097
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:35,310
Let's plant more trees.

3098
02:29:35,650 --> 02:29:37,130
Come on, grow, grow, grow.

3099
02:29:38,050 --> 02:29:40,230
Grow, grow, grow, please.

3100
02:29:42,650 --> 02:29:43,370
Expand, expand.

3101
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:49,720
There's a first for everything.

3102
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:51,300
I know.

3103
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:55,220
Don't you get like certain parasites from...

3104
02:29:55,220 --> 02:29:56,320
How did you get up there?

3105
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:58,140
From eating brains, though?

3106
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,480
If I don't make it...

3107
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:09,880
Oh, my gosh.

3108
02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:11,660
It's beautiful.

3109
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:13,160
It took forever to grow.

3110
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:16,300
If I don't make it...

3111
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:16,860
Oh, my gosh.

3112
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:19,560
It grew because my body is going to die here.

3113
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:22,020
Oh, my God.

3114
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:23,800
I'm going to die here.

3115
02:30:25,260 --> 02:30:28,460
I'm going to move this so it's not under the tree.

3116
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:32,920
Maybe we'll get some actual water so we can grow some pumpkins or something.

3117
02:30:34,140 --> 02:30:35,220
Melon, something.

3118
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:36,460
Melon.

3119
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:39,860
It grew you a place to rest.

3120
02:30:48,150 --> 02:30:49,790
I want to live.

3121
02:30:51,010 --> 02:30:51,610
Please.

3122
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:54,770
Please, grow world.

3123
02:30:54,930 --> 02:30:56,630
Just give me some fruit.

3124
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:57,890
Something.

3125
02:30:59,450 --> 02:31:00,830
I don't want to die.

3126
02:31:01,570 --> 02:31:03,450
Oh, let's plant another tree here.

3127
02:31:04,970 --> 02:31:06,150
Just keep planting trees.

3128
02:31:07,570 --> 02:31:08,190
One more.

3129
02:31:11,090 --> 02:31:12,950
Food fun for hungry ghosts?

3130
02:31:13,190 --> 02:31:15,630
But ghosts don't eat food, do they?

3131
02:31:15,990 --> 02:31:16,850
Yes, we do!

3132
02:31:17,050 --> 02:31:18,450
What do you think the sacrifice is?

3133
02:31:18,610 --> 02:31:22,170
You know, people leave offerings and stuff for ghosts!

3134
02:31:22,810 --> 02:31:23,790
Because we're hungry!

3135
02:31:23,970 --> 02:31:24,630
Hungry ghosts!

3136
02:31:26,090 --> 02:31:28,410
I'm sure you'll find a way to survive sooner or later.

3137
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:35,300
Yeah, you've never heard of a hungry ghost before?

3138
02:31:39,950 --> 02:31:40,870
It's real.

3139
02:31:41,590 --> 02:31:42,670
Hungry ghosts.

3140
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,420
You're next, buddy.

3141
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:49,900
You're next.

3142
02:31:53,370 --> 02:32:03,950
People leave out... rice... whatever...

3143
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:06,270
Oranges is a popular thing!

3144
02:32:06,470 --> 02:32:07,010
Oranges!

3145
02:32:07,930 --> 02:32:08,890
Live, Mint!

3146
02:32:08,970 --> 02:32:09,790
You have to live!

3147
02:32:12,930 --> 02:32:15,210
Wernst... Dortholf... Hunter!

3148
02:32:15,430 --> 02:32:16,690
How long do I have to live?

3149
02:32:18,470 --> 02:32:19,850
What's a ghost's favorite food?

3150
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:21,510
Boulogne!

3151
02:32:46,070 --> 02:32:47,910
That's up for you to decide, Minto.

3152
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:51,750
No water for crops?

3153
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:52,730
We have no water?

3154
02:32:55,590 --> 02:32:57,650
I made some sort of progress.

3155
02:32:58,270 --> 02:33:00,330
But I'm not rewarded for it.

3156
02:33:06,470 --> 02:33:08,930
Actually, I don't know what progress I made.

3157
02:33:10,170 --> 02:33:11,730
Can I eat bamboo?

3158
02:33:12,750 --> 02:33:13,810
It's sugar, right?

3159
02:33:14,050 --> 02:33:15,330
It's kind of the same as sugarcane?

3160
02:33:18,710 --> 02:33:19,190
Bulgogi?

3161
02:33:19,390 --> 02:33:20,770
I love bulgogi, though.

3162
02:33:21,250 --> 02:33:22,090
So good.

3163
02:33:26,300 --> 02:33:27,760
You guys are making me hungry.

3164
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:36,250
I had the most mediocre pizza last night.

3165
02:33:39,330 --> 02:33:41,850
The travel was hard, I'll be honest.

3166
02:33:43,270 --> 02:33:44,830
It was so...

3167
02:33:45,770 --> 02:33:46,270
Gosh.

3168
02:33:47,530 --> 02:33:50,450
It was like... I think that's why I don't know what day it is.

3169
02:33:50,510 --> 02:33:52,030
Because everything was just so long.

3170
02:33:55,570 --> 02:33:56,070
Rinblei!

3171
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:56,990
Thanks for the three months!

3172
02:34:00,850 --> 02:34:01,350
Boulogne...

3173
02:34:03,010 --> 02:34:03,510
What?

3174
02:34:05,750 --> 02:34:06,230
Boulogne...

3175
02:34:06,230 --> 02:34:06,650
Boulogne...

3176
02:34:07,610 --> 02:34:08,090
Boulognes.

3177
02:34:09,010 --> 02:34:10,310
Hope you had fun at MGSK.

3178
02:34:10,410 --> 02:34:10,730
I love you.

3179
02:34:11,070 --> 02:34:11,850
Thank you!

3180
02:34:12,890 --> 02:34:13,630
I did.

3181
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:14,670
It's so much fun.

3182
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:17,150
I hope it happens again next year.

3183
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:28,400
This is the map that if you jump off, you just TP to the top again.

3184
02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:31,960
I know one of these maps do that, but don't do that and refill.

3185
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:33,560
Wait.

3186
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:34,980
Okay, let's attempt.

3187
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:38,600
This is for science.

3188
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:40,440
We're doing it.

3189
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:42,620
We're jumping off the edge of the world for science.

3190
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:55,360
For science!

3191
02:34:59,560 --> 02:35:01,580
Looks like... It looks like Outer Wilds here.

3192
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:02,640
Do a flip.

3193
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:22,980
Fall into the void!

3194
02:35:24,180 --> 02:35:25,220
We did it!

3195
02:35:27,320 --> 02:35:28,160
Yippee!

3196
02:35:34,130 --> 02:35:34,970
Yay!

3197
02:35:38,050 --> 02:35:38,890
Yay!

3198
02:35:38,890 --> 02:35:40,750
The void fed you!

3199
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:42,470
Oh my gosh!

3200
02:35:43,990 --> 02:35:45,870
We know the strats.

3201
02:35:46,930 --> 02:35:48,370
We know the life hacks.

3202
02:35:52,370 --> 02:35:54,070
What you doing down here?

3203
02:35:54,250 --> 02:35:56,070
On the death... death walk.

3204
02:35:57,150 --> 02:35:58,350
Free food!

3205
02:35:59,210 --> 02:36:00,550
More food!

3206
02:36:00,550 --> 02:36:02,030
Order a horse.

3207
02:36:02,530 --> 02:36:03,730
Order a llama.

3208
02:36:04,210 --> 02:36:05,570
When are we getting to the good stuff?

3209
02:36:06,290 --> 02:36:06,370
Huh?

3210
02:36:08,690 --> 02:36:09,250
Gravel.

3211
02:36:10,370 --> 02:36:12,470
Gravel gives us flint.

3212
02:36:13,130 --> 02:36:14,650
Maybe we should order some of that.

3213
02:36:15,310 --> 02:36:16,170
Do I have enough dirt?

3214
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:22,620
Cauldron has water.

3215
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:23,600
No it doesn't.

3216
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:26,900
We escaped death by dying.

3217
02:36:27,100 --> 02:36:27,520
Woohoo!

3218
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:31,600
The pufferfish has water!

3219
02:36:32,320 --> 02:36:33,440
Wait, does it count?

3220
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:42,180
Does this count?

3221
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:45,140
Oh!

3222
02:36:45,740 --> 02:36:46,140
Oh!

3223
02:36:46,300 --> 02:36:46,700
Oh!

3224
02:36:46,860 --> 02:36:47,260
Oh!

3225
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:47,700
Wait!

3226
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:48,140
Oh!

3227
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:48,920
Oh god!

3228
02:36:57,110 --> 02:36:58,550
He's just swimming around over there.

3229
02:36:59,290 --> 02:37:00,770
I'm gonna take away his life source.

3230
02:37:17,200 --> 02:37:17,780
Oh no!

3231
02:37:17,880 --> 02:37:18,300
Oh no!

3232
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:18,460
No!

3233
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:18,660
Wait!

3234
02:37:18,740 --> 02:37:19,140
Don't!

3235
02:37:19,180 --> 02:37:19,600
I can't!

3236
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:19,980
I got it!

3237
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:20,240
I can't!

3238
02:37:20,320 --> 02:37:20,860
I need to live!

3239
02:37:21,480 --> 02:37:22,560
Get a second one.

3240
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,620
Can I put this in here?

3241
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:28,040
There we go!

3242
02:37:29,660 --> 02:37:30,060
Alright!

3243
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:32,520
Wait, if I get a...

3244
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:35,480
How many do I need to make an endless...

3245
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:37,320
An endless...

3246
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:38,640
You know...

3247
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:40,020
Okay, I'm gonna put it...

3248
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:41,820
I'm gonna meticulously put it here.

3249
02:37:42,140 --> 02:37:42,540
Okay.

3250
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:43,320
See?

3251
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:45,160
Goodbye.

3252
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:51,320
Now, if he falls off the edge...

3253
02:37:51,320 --> 02:37:52,060
I mean...

3254
02:37:53,020 --> 02:37:54,100
Two by two for him.

3255
02:37:54,100 --> 02:37:54,200
For infinite.

3256
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:54,680
Okay.

3257
02:37:54,760 --> 02:37:54,960
Okay.

3258
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:11,240
Save him?

3259
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:12,640
For what purpose?

3260
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:16,020
For what purpose do we need this guy?

3261
02:38:16,860 --> 02:38:17,380
Alright.

3262
02:38:17,620 --> 02:38:20,820
Let's do our water...

3263
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:23,180
Right here in the corner.

3264
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:25,620
Right here in the corner!

3265
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:27,100
Okay.

3266
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:29,120
I have to be careful about...

3267
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:31,180
About this though.

3268
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:32,480
Okay.

3269
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:33,880
Oh!

3270
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:34,320
No!

3271
02:38:52,310 --> 02:38:52,830
No!

3272
02:38:52,850 --> 02:38:53,450
Let me...

3273
02:38:53,450 --> 02:38:54,830
Let me cook.

3274
02:38:54,830 --> 02:38:55,510
Let me cook!

3275
02:38:56,670 --> 02:38:56,990
What?!

3276
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:00,610
You need a floor, yah?

3277
02:39:00,690 --> 02:39:01,390
What do you think I'm doing?

3278
02:39:08,220 --> 02:39:09,520
Alright, there's our floor.

3279
02:39:10,300 --> 02:39:11,240
There's our floor.

3280
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:13,940
Ah-hah!

3281
02:39:17,740 --> 02:39:18,360
Water!

3282
02:39:21,380 --> 02:39:22,880
How sweet water!

3283
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:24,320
Sweet water...

3284
02:39:25,050 --> 02:39:26,140
Sweet water!

3285
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:27,280
Sweet water!

3286
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:27,520
Water!

3287
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:29,800
Let's plant!

3288
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:33,180
Oh my gosh, we're finally gaming.

3289
02:39:34,100 --> 02:39:35,080
Let's make a hole.

3290
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:39,180
Alright, Chet, who's volunteering?

3291
02:40:01,350 --> 02:40:02,310
Oh, sorry.

3292
02:40:02,550 --> 02:40:03,210
I didn't mean to hit you.

3293
02:40:03,370 --> 02:40:04,050
Are you okay?

3294
02:40:04,510 --> 02:40:04,990
No!

3295
02:40:05,150 --> 02:40:06,190
He raised his prices!

3296
02:40:11,650 --> 02:40:12,930
I didn't murder him.

3297
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:15,130
He went down with the ship.

3298
02:40:15,810 --> 02:40:17,370
As a good captain should.

3299
02:40:18,170 --> 02:40:20,630
If you make a big enough pond, you can fish.

3300
02:40:21,250 --> 02:40:21,730
True!

3301
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:27,920
Very good!

3302
02:40:28,300 --> 02:40:30,020
Let's put this... let's move this guy.

3303
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:37,640
Can I fish here?

3304
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:38,460
In this thing?

3305
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:39,280
Or is it too small?

3306
02:40:41,320 --> 02:40:42,580
Man, I love fishing.

3307
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:48,720
You can fish in any size pond.

3308
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:49,420
Oh, no way!

3309
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:53,880
Alright, perfect.

3310
02:40:56,100 --> 02:40:58,580
Now, let's keep... let's keep one blocking.

3311
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:01,920
I do kind of want to...

3312
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:05,780
Maybe go down here.

3313
02:41:06,260 --> 02:41:11,260
We should start making... we should start building like a downstairs area as well, I think.

3314
02:41:16,830 --> 02:41:18,930
I think we should start building a...

3315
02:41:18,930 --> 02:41:21,570
A downstairs area.

3316
02:41:29,210 --> 02:41:30,750
Where do I want to build it?

3317
02:41:33,490 --> 02:41:34,190
Oh, wait.

3318
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:36,610
I can put more of the flowers down too.

3319
02:41:37,210 --> 02:41:40,030
We'll never... we'll never get these bees but that's okay.

3320
02:41:41,730 --> 02:41:42,250
Hmm...

3321
02:41:43,450 --> 02:41:45,330
Put your tools away just in case.

3322
02:41:45,630 --> 02:41:47,290
You don't have any faith in me?

3323
02:41:47,290 --> 02:41:48,690
You don't have any faith in me?

3324
02:41:50,610 --> 02:41:51,490
You don't have any faith in me?

3325
02:41:51,490 --> 02:41:52,970
I go down when you can go up?

3326
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:59,020
Well, I do want to build one thing below.

3327
02:41:59,620 --> 02:42:03,440
I do... below... below I do want to build one thing.

3328
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:07,580
And hold on, I will do it.

3329
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:11,400
No!

3330
02:42:15,240 --> 02:42:19,420
Because I kind of want to build a thing below the... the one block.

3331
02:42:20,700 --> 02:42:21,920
Oh gosh, it's so scary though.

3332
02:42:22,340 --> 02:42:23,460
Wait, where's the one block?

3333
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:26,700
Okay, this one...

3334
02:42:27,460 --> 02:42:28,020
Okay.

3335
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:29,100
Here.

3336
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:32,360
That... nope, just kidding.

3337
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:34,680
That one.

3338
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:35,760
Right!

3339
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:37,520
That's the one block.

3340
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:38,720
I believe.

3341
02:42:39,260 --> 02:42:39,820
Right!

3342
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:41,740
That's the one block.

3343
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:42,840
I think.

3344
02:42:44,320 --> 02:42:45,860
Oh yeah, we got water!

3345
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:46,340
Finally!

3346
02:42:51,650 --> 02:42:52,350
It's okay.

3347
02:42:57,850 --> 02:42:58,530
Uh-oh.

3348
02:42:58,590 --> 02:42:59,590
Am I gonna drown?

3349
02:43:00,490 --> 02:43:01,210
There we go.

3350
02:43:01,490 --> 02:43:01,710
Oh!

3351
02:43:01,850 --> 02:43:02,170
Oh!

3352
02:43:02,270 --> 02:43:02,570
Oh!

3353
02:43:03,050 --> 02:43:03,830
We're okay!

3354
02:43:04,150 --> 02:43:04,710
We're...

3355
02:43:06,430 --> 02:43:07,170
We're okay.

3356
02:43:08,850 --> 02:43:10,370
Everything is all good.

3357
02:43:12,370 --> 02:43:14,210
I even have dirt to replace it.

3358
02:43:15,950 --> 02:43:16,510
Perfect.

3359
02:43:17,150 --> 02:43:17,710
Now...

3360
02:43:17,710 --> 02:43:19,830
I will feel less...

3361
02:43:21,230 --> 02:43:21,790
Nervous...

3362
02:43:22,770 --> 02:43:23,330
About...

3363
02:43:24,470 --> 02:43:25,030
Oh!

3364
02:43:25,150 --> 02:43:25,610
Oops.

3365
02:43:25,610 --> 02:43:25,630
Oops.

3366
02:43:30,050 --> 02:43:30,590
About...

3367
02:43:31,130 --> 02:43:31,430
Uh...

3368
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:32,870
Getting stuff here.

3369
02:43:40,260 --> 02:43:42,620
Hungry Ghost Festival is actually a holiday here.

3370
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:43,920
In Hong Kong.

3371
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:44,920
Happening next month.

3372
02:43:45,220 --> 02:43:46,940
I'll remember to leave you some leftover offering.

3373
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:47,640
Yes!

3374
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:48,160
Thank you!

3375
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:50,240
That's exactly what I'm talking about!

3376
02:43:51,300 --> 02:43:52,460
Thank you so much.

3377
02:43:54,860 --> 02:43:56,980
Maybe people don't know about Hungry Ghost.

3378
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:01,200
I think we need more food.

3379
02:44:01,360 --> 02:44:01,960
A.K.A.

3380
02:44:01,960 --> 02:44:03,560
It might be time to...

3381
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:05,680
Send me over...

3382
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:07,600
I'm going over the edge a little bit, you guys.

3383
02:44:07,860 --> 02:44:08,680
Might be time to...

3384
02:44:09,240 --> 02:44:10,600
Send me over the edge.

3385
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:19,360
I don't know why August is such a haunted month.

3386
02:44:22,180 --> 02:44:22,720
Thank you!

3387
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:23,040
Thank you!

3388
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:24,080
Thank you!

3389
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:28,200
Back to the infinite void.

3390
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:29,900
Not again!

3391
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:31,340
Yes again!

3392
02:44:31,340 --> 02:44:32,920
Ha ha ha ha ha!

3393
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:34,020
Again!

3394
02:44:34,180 --> 02:44:34,440
Again!

3395
02:44:35,060 --> 02:44:36,540
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

3396
02:44:37,640 --> 02:44:38,160
Again!

3397
02:44:38,320 --> 02:44:38,560
Again!

3398
02:44:39,740 --> 02:44:41,000
Because summer vacation?

3399
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:43,960
Maybe.

3400
02:44:49,170 --> 02:44:50,550
There's so much to live for.

3401
02:44:51,090 --> 02:44:52,190
I'm not even alive!

3402
02:44:57,090 --> 02:45:00,310
But I'm glad I have so much to be dead for.

3403
02:45:02,350 --> 02:45:03,650
I'm so glad I'm dead.

3404
02:45:05,050 --> 02:45:07,570
Even though it's so much like being alive, I think.

3405
02:45:08,570 --> 02:45:09,350
Just like...

3406
02:45:09,350 --> 02:45:11,030
A little extra stuff.

3407
02:45:11,630 --> 02:45:12,170
You know?

3408
02:45:12,630 --> 02:45:13,630
It's hard to explain.

3409
02:45:16,530 --> 02:45:18,110
So much to be unalive for.

3410
02:45:18,470 --> 02:45:19,130
Ha ha ha ha!

3411
02:45:19,550 --> 02:45:20,950
You seen that fun with it?

3412
02:45:21,290 --> 02:45:21,730
Yeah!

3413
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:24,590
I have a pretty good time.

3414
02:45:29,330 --> 02:45:31,270
Even the dead can't escape taxes.

3415
02:45:31,330 --> 02:45:31,910
That's what I'm saying.

3416
02:45:31,950 --> 02:45:33,590
I think it's so similar to being alive.

3417
02:45:38,270 --> 02:45:39,530
But you know...

3418
02:45:47,370 --> 02:45:48,870
When are you guys coming out?

3419
02:45:51,090 --> 02:45:52,690
I hear you in there.

3420
02:45:53,250 --> 02:45:54,790
And when are these guys gonna grow?

3421
02:45:55,710 --> 02:45:57,210
There's taxes in the afterlife?

3422
02:45:57,690 --> 02:45:58,990
Oh buddy...

3423
02:45:59,730 --> 02:46:01,730
I don't know how to tell you this but...

3424
02:46:02,790 --> 02:46:04,990
I said it's pretty similar to...

3425
02:46:04,990 --> 02:46:05,370
Ha ha ha ha!

3426
02:46:06,530 --> 02:46:08,910
I said it's pretty similar to...

3427
02:46:08,910 --> 02:46:08,970
Ha ha ha ha!

3428
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:26,730
I don't want to say real life, because I feel like my life, even though it's the afterlife, it's still real life.

3429
02:46:29,290 --> 02:46:30,450
So... what is it?

3430
02:46:30,950 --> 02:46:34,170
Oh no, I'm feeling the existentialism again happening.

3431
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:47,980
It's your reality.

3432
02:46:48,420 --> 02:46:48,920
Yeah.

3433
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:51,760
It's my reality.

3434
02:47:02,950 --> 02:47:06,370
I googled how to free myself from both life and death.

3435
02:47:10,830 --> 02:47:11,930
Oh, did I?

3436
02:47:12,070 --> 02:47:13,110
Oh no, just kidding.

3437
02:47:15,350 --> 02:47:18,070
But now, being a ghost is pretty dandy, I would say so.

3438
02:47:20,290 --> 02:47:22,950
Is this the real life?

3439
02:47:22,950 --> 02:47:26,830
Or... is this just fantasy?

3440
02:47:30,910 --> 02:47:32,150
I'm starting to get sleepy.

3441
02:47:35,690 --> 02:47:37,630
We're almost at 2000 blocks.

3442
02:47:39,470 --> 02:47:41,110
When will we get an animal?

3443
02:47:43,660 --> 02:47:45,950
Oh wait, the animal's right here.

3444
02:47:56,930 --> 02:47:58,210
Chat's full of them.

3445
02:47:59,590 --> 02:48:00,330
I know.

3446
02:48:01,310 --> 02:48:02,490
What the...

3447
02:48:03,390 --> 02:48:05,390
Where's the... pickaxe?

3448
02:48:10,790 --> 02:48:11,630
Meow.

3449
02:48:14,290 --> 02:48:15,130
Meow.

3450
02:48:15,810 --> 02:48:16,430
Meow.

3451
02:48:17,010 --> 02:48:17,750
Meow.

3452
02:48:18,170 --> 02:48:18,410
Meow.

3453
02:48:18,410 --> 02:48:18,590
Meow.

3454
02:48:21,230 --> 02:48:23,550
Did I get... oh no, there's some iron.

3455
02:48:24,390 --> 02:48:25,150
And sticks.

3456
02:48:25,590 --> 02:48:26,870
Meow, where's the...

3457
02:48:28,730 --> 02:48:29,990
Oh, I need three.

3458
02:48:30,830 --> 02:48:32,330
World of Darkness lore.

3459
02:48:32,430 --> 02:48:35,290
Ghosts live in a reflection of the living world called the Shadowlands.

3460
02:48:35,570 --> 02:48:38,030
And they do have to pay ghost taxes.

3461
02:48:38,590 --> 02:48:40,050
Yeah, why would I make that up?

3462
02:48:40,170 --> 02:48:41,730
Why would I make up ghost taxes?

3463
02:48:45,850 --> 02:48:46,330
Pickaxe.

3464
02:48:49,470 --> 02:48:52,550
It's death and taxes, not death or taxes.

3465
02:48:55,030 --> 02:48:56,450
Why'd you spawn in there?

3466
02:48:57,670 --> 02:48:59,370
I want the trial key.

3467
02:48:59,370 --> 02:49:00,790
I want to know what that is.

3468
02:49:00,910 --> 02:49:01,730
I'm so curious.

3469
02:49:02,670 --> 02:49:03,630
I'm so curious.

3470
02:49:04,570 --> 02:49:05,130
I'm so curious.

3471
02:49:05,350 --> 02:49:06,030
I'm so curious.

3472
02:49:09,570 --> 02:49:10,370
Enzo Mancini.

3473
02:49:14,270 --> 02:49:14,670
Enzo...

3474
02:49:15,470 --> 02:49:16,250
Enzo my man.

3475
02:49:19,330 --> 02:49:22,570
Would you rather be a ghost who can't haunt or a maid cafe...

3476
02:49:22,570 --> 02:49:23,450
Oh, sorry, a maid.

3477
02:49:25,470 --> 02:49:26,710
Oh, I think the music's so good.

3478
02:49:27,050 --> 02:49:27,450
Oh.

3479
02:49:27,450 --> 02:49:29,570
Or a maid that can't clean.

3480
02:49:31,550 --> 02:49:33,030
I love haunting though.

3481
02:49:33,230 --> 02:49:34,370
I'm haunting you right now.

3482
02:49:36,430 --> 02:49:39,030
Do you want me to not haunt you anymore?

3483
02:49:40,190 --> 02:49:42,350
If you don't want me to haunt you anymore, I get it.

3484
02:49:42,590 --> 02:49:43,650
It's a little freaky.

3485
02:49:43,970 --> 02:49:45,270
It's not everybody's thing.

3486
02:49:51,850 --> 02:49:52,450
I'll stop.

3487
02:49:53,590 --> 02:49:54,290
I'll stop.

3488
02:49:54,290 --> 02:49:55,830
I'll stop taking your life floors.

3489
02:49:56,710 --> 02:49:57,450
I'll stop.

3490
02:49:57,610 --> 02:49:58,990
I'll stop haunting you.

3491
02:50:00,390 --> 02:50:01,030
Don't worry.

3492
02:50:07,630 --> 02:50:08,870
Actually, I don't clean.

3493
02:50:08,870 --> 02:50:10,350
I don't clean very well.

3494
02:50:13,930 --> 02:50:15,510
So you're like, which would you want?

3495
02:50:15,630 --> 02:50:16,450
Which would you want?

3496
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:17,910
And I'm like, well, I'm already...

3497
02:50:17,910 --> 02:50:21,910
It's kind of already currently one or the other.

3498
02:50:22,910 --> 02:50:24,630
I can't clean very well.

3499
02:50:25,430 --> 02:50:26,110
You guys.

3500
02:50:26,230 --> 02:50:26,450
Okay.

3501
02:50:26,670 --> 02:50:27,110
Okay.

3502
02:50:28,470 --> 02:50:28,910
Okay.

3503
02:50:28,910 --> 02:50:35,110
It's, it's a, it's, it's called being a maid cafe maid.

3504
02:50:38,490 --> 02:50:41,150
It's called being a maid cafe maid where.

3505
02:50:44,890 --> 02:50:49,570
Where it just I, I, I, I'm, I'm like serve in the cafe.

3506
02:50:49,790 --> 02:50:51,750
I don't really do much of anything else.

3507
02:50:53,410 --> 02:50:54,490
Can you cook?

3508
02:50:54,770 --> 02:50:58,050
Well, I mean like there's like chefs that to that at the.

3509
02:50:58,170 --> 02:50:58,430
Yeah.

3510
02:51:00,270 --> 02:51:01,690
There's people who do that.

3511
02:51:01,850 --> 02:51:02,890
Like, I serve!

3512
02:51:04,730 --> 02:51:07,490
I'm serving all day, every day.

3513
02:51:09,330 --> 02:51:11,330
And you guys are wisps.

3514
02:51:11,370 --> 02:51:13,210
You're also my goshijinsama and ojonsama.

3515
02:51:16,730 --> 02:51:18,230
Oh, what happened?

3516
02:51:19,370 --> 02:51:20,450
Why did I shrink?

3517
02:51:22,030 --> 02:51:23,330
What happened to me?

3518
02:51:25,270 --> 02:51:26,410
That was kind of freaky.

3519
02:51:27,870 --> 02:51:30,270
You can draw some cool stuff on Omurice.

3520
02:51:30,410 --> 02:51:30,730
Yeah!

3521
02:51:33,690 --> 02:51:34,810
I'm serving.

3522
02:51:34,990 --> 02:51:36,030
Can you slay though?

3523
02:51:44,280 --> 02:51:44,920
Slay!

3524
02:51:46,980 --> 02:51:47,620
Slay!

3525
02:51:48,580 --> 02:51:49,220
Slay!

3526
02:51:52,360 --> 02:51:54,440
She's the Van Gogh of Ketamjoys.

3527
02:51:58,140 --> 02:51:58,780
Slay!

3528
02:52:03,590 --> 02:52:06,850
Why is the potato taking so long?

3529
02:52:08,390 --> 02:52:11,550
Maybe I need the pumpkin instead.

3530
02:52:13,450 --> 02:52:14,090
Pumpkin seed.

3531
02:52:14,930 --> 02:52:16,870
Wait, I have a couple of pumpkin seeds.

3532
02:52:16,910 --> 02:52:17,550
Let's just do everything.

3533
02:52:17,950 --> 02:52:21,330
Oh, but for the pumpkin, I need sugar and stuff like that too, don't I?

3534
02:52:22,350 --> 02:52:23,530
Wait, it's melon.

3535
02:52:23,730 --> 02:52:25,070
The melon can just grow!

3536
02:52:26,210 --> 02:52:27,650
Baby core, thanks to the gifted!

3537
02:52:29,210 --> 02:52:30,750
You need to go muy muy cute.

3538
02:52:31,830 --> 02:52:32,110
Okay.

3539
02:52:45,870 --> 02:52:46,610
I'm looking.

3540
02:52:46,790 --> 02:52:48,170
I'm looking at the seed.

3541
02:52:51,350 --> 02:52:54,170
Oh, maybe it's intimidated if I'm holding this, right?

3542
02:52:59,810 --> 02:53:00,930
Oishiku nare!

3543
02:53:03,530 --> 02:53:06,510
Muy muy cute!

3544
02:53:20,930 --> 02:53:22,410
I think it grew a little.

3545
02:53:23,890 --> 02:53:25,270
Do I have any bone meal?

3546
02:53:28,210 --> 02:53:29,130
It grew!

3547
02:53:30,130 --> 02:53:30,730
Micmac!

3548
02:53:31,490 --> 02:53:32,670
Thanks to the gifted!

3549
02:53:36,150 --> 02:53:37,170
Maybe I can get some more.

3550
02:53:37,410 --> 02:53:37,930
Nope.

3551
02:53:38,930 --> 02:53:39,650
That's it.

3552
02:53:39,830 --> 02:53:40,490
Oh, yes.

3553
02:53:40,630 --> 02:53:41,210
More.

3554
02:53:47,050 --> 02:53:48,350
Someone grew taller.

3555
02:53:49,490 --> 02:53:50,390
It's me!

3556
02:53:52,270 --> 02:53:54,750
I'm a whole whopping 10 feet now.

3557
02:53:56,170 --> 02:53:57,750
Try calling me small.

3558
02:53:59,750 --> 02:54:01,230
We're so close to 2,000.

3559
02:54:04,050 --> 02:54:04,730
Wait, no.

3560
02:54:04,850 --> 02:54:05,850
I was right the first time.

3561
02:54:05,930 --> 02:54:06,150
There we go.

3562
02:54:14,970 --> 02:54:16,150
10 feet, imagine.

3563
02:54:17,110 --> 02:54:20,130
I'm your giantess Vtuber.

3564
02:54:20,870 --> 02:54:21,690
Actually, what?

3565
02:54:22,190 --> 02:54:23,250
Giantess would be like...

3566
02:54:23,250 --> 02:54:25,670
They're like skyscraper size, right?

3567
02:54:25,990 --> 02:54:27,050
Oh, 2,000!

3568
02:54:28,870 --> 02:54:29,790
New recipe.

3569
02:54:29,970 --> 02:54:31,110
Just check your recipe book.

3570
02:54:31,110 --> 02:54:31,890
Huh?

3571
02:54:32,830 --> 02:54:33,390
Huh?

3572
02:54:33,550 --> 02:54:34,070
Huh?

3573
02:54:34,530 --> 02:54:35,550
What did I make?

3574
02:54:37,710 --> 02:54:38,630
I can't...

3575
02:54:38,630 --> 02:54:40,070
Did I grab something?

3576
02:54:40,370 --> 02:54:40,890
No.

3577
02:54:41,130 --> 02:54:43,710
They don't like give you any sort of like...

3578
02:54:44,850 --> 02:54:45,970
Achieve anything...

3579
02:54:45,970 --> 02:54:48,750
Any bonuses for when you like hit certain things.

3580
02:54:48,870 --> 02:54:49,470
It's so sad.

3581
02:54:58,810 --> 02:54:59,730
They're just...

3582
02:54:59,730 --> 02:55:02,330
Yeah, giantess are usually like super duper...

3583
02:55:02,330 --> 02:55:04,030
Yeah, 10 feet is Amazonian.

3584
02:55:04,050 --> 02:55:05,110
Yeah, I think so.

3585
02:55:06,010 --> 02:55:08,990
And then like a giantess is like the size of a...

3586
02:55:08,990 --> 02:55:11,310
Like a skyscraper, right?

3587
02:55:11,430 --> 02:55:12,410
Like a tall building.

3588
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:21,880
I can be that.

3589
02:55:27,260 --> 02:55:29,660
Free-fi-fo-fum.

3590
02:55:32,700 --> 02:55:34,820
Free-fi-fo-fum.

3591
02:55:46,580 --> 02:55:49,280
Have you guys ever noticed that my sock is a little transparent?

3592
02:55:53,050 --> 02:55:53,990
Have you ever noticed?

3593
02:55:55,390 --> 02:55:56,110
Where's my new sock?

3594
02:55:57,910 --> 02:55:58,510
On my socks.

3595
02:56:02,820 --> 02:56:03,520
On my skirt.

3596
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:05,920
There's something...

3597
02:56:07,240 --> 02:56:07,600
Okay.

3598
02:56:07,740 --> 02:56:09,960
I don't think I've ever showed this to you guys before.

3599
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:13,860
I want to show you something kind of interesting.

3600
02:56:14,160 --> 02:56:15,480
Wait, I took this picture...

3601
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:16,520
Actually, no.

3602
02:56:16,640 --> 02:56:17,920
I'll just post it on Twitter later.

3603
02:56:21,970 --> 02:56:23,510
Actually, I wonder if I could do it right now.

3604
02:56:25,530 --> 02:56:26,370
Give me a second.

3605
02:56:27,990 --> 02:56:29,650
I wonder if I could do it right now.

3606
02:56:30,330 --> 02:56:31,850
If I could show you right now.

3607
02:56:33,010 --> 02:56:33,710
One second.

3608
02:56:34,370 --> 02:56:35,090
One second.

3609
02:56:35,290 --> 02:56:36,310
It might take me a second though.

3610
02:56:37,190 --> 02:56:37,730
Oh, wait.

3611
02:56:40,710 --> 02:56:42,110
No, I don't think I can.

3612
02:56:42,990 --> 02:56:43,870
Wait, hold on.

3613
02:56:45,610 --> 02:56:46,450
Wait, hold on.

3614
02:56:46,590 --> 02:56:47,290
I don't think I can.

3615
02:56:48,350 --> 02:56:49,930
No, I don't think I can.

3616
02:56:50,950 --> 02:56:51,350
No!

3617
02:56:52,010 --> 02:56:52,910
Wait, maybe I can.

3618
02:56:53,270 --> 02:56:53,670
No!

3619
02:56:55,130 --> 02:56:56,110
Wait, maybe I can.

3620
02:56:56,110 --> 02:56:57,090
What the heck is she talking about?

3621
02:56:57,710 --> 02:56:59,390
What the heck is she talking about?

3622
02:57:01,550 --> 02:57:02,810
I'm gonna see, I'm gonna see.

3623
02:57:03,350 --> 02:57:04,030
Yes, you can.

3624
02:57:05,110 --> 02:57:07,250
I can do anything I put my mind to, maybe.

3625
02:57:09,750 --> 02:57:10,150
Maybe.

3626
02:57:11,810 --> 02:57:12,750
Hold on, hold on.

3627
02:57:14,570 --> 02:57:15,630
I wonder if it'll work.

3628
02:57:15,770 --> 02:57:17,290
Oh my gosh, I think it's working.

3629
02:57:18,090 --> 02:57:18,770
Wait a second.

3630
02:57:19,490 --> 02:57:20,190
Wait a second.

3631
02:57:20,850 --> 02:57:23,390
Putting my mind in the bubble.

3632
02:57:24,970 --> 02:57:26,190
Look at this.

3633
02:57:26,330 --> 02:57:27,210
It's kind of amazing.

3634
02:57:27,810 --> 02:57:28,910
It's kind of amazing.

3635
02:57:31,490 --> 02:57:32,530
So basically...

3636
02:57:33,130 --> 02:57:34,090
I don't wanna...

3637
02:57:35,030 --> 02:57:37,250
alert anybody, but I'm kind of stripping.

3638
02:57:40,150 --> 02:57:43,790
I don't wanna alert anybody, but I'm kind of stripping right now.

3639
02:57:47,830 --> 02:57:48,710
But you'll see.

3640
02:57:49,970 --> 02:57:50,490
Alerted?

3641
02:57:52,550 --> 02:57:53,350
It's so...

3642
02:57:53,390 --> 02:57:54,190
It's so cool.

3643
02:57:55,050 --> 02:57:56,850
I hope YouTube doesn't get mad at me.

3644
02:57:58,630 --> 02:58:00,250
I discovered this the other day.

3645
02:58:06,030 --> 02:58:06,950
It's so cool.

3646
02:58:08,550 --> 02:58:09,910
Don't get mad at me, YouTube, okay?

3647
02:58:12,170 --> 02:58:13,210
Don't get mad at me, YouTube.

3648
02:58:17,640 --> 02:58:18,360
One second.

3649
02:58:22,420 --> 02:58:23,120
One second.

3650
02:58:26,510 --> 02:58:27,190
One second.

3651
02:58:30,030 --> 02:58:30,710
One second.

3652
02:58:40,430 --> 02:58:41,530
What's going on?

3653
02:58:52,870 --> 02:58:54,230
One second.

3654
02:58:55,590 --> 02:58:56,610
One second.

3655
02:58:58,670 --> 02:58:59,690
One second.

3656
02:59:00,530 --> 02:59:01,230
One second.

3657
02:59:03,430 --> 02:59:05,810
One second, one second, one second.

3658
02:59:05,810 --> 02:59:06,330
Sorry.

3659
02:59:08,290 --> 02:59:08,970
Now...

3660
02:59:08,970 --> 02:59:11,810
I discovered this the other day and now I'm like...

3661
02:59:13,670 --> 02:59:14,790
I'm like...

3662
02:59:15,990 --> 02:59:17,110
It's so fun.

3663
02:59:18,310 --> 02:59:19,190
You'll see.

3664
02:59:19,750 --> 02:59:20,830
In a second.

3665
02:59:21,530 --> 02:59:22,890
It's kind of scandalous.

3666
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:28,560
Wait a second.

3667
02:59:28,820 --> 02:59:29,420
One second.

3668
02:59:30,500 --> 02:59:31,460
One second.

3669
02:59:32,400 --> 02:59:33,300
You'll see.

3670
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:34,280
You'll see.

3671
02:59:34,280 --> 02:59:34,380
You'll see.

3672
02:59:35,780 --> 02:59:36,780
You'll see.

3673
02:59:42,110 --> 02:59:44,010
It's kind of weird because I'm a ghost though.

3674
02:59:46,770 --> 02:59:48,530
It's kind of weird because I'm a ghost though.

3675
02:59:50,990 --> 02:59:51,490
Look.

3676
02:59:56,600 --> 02:59:58,800
This is the longest second of my life.

3677
02:59:59,280 --> 02:59:59,420
This is the longest second of my life.

3678
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:02,100
You guys, look.

3679
03:00:03,420 --> 03:00:04,540
I can have...

3680
03:00:05,480 --> 03:00:06,940
I can take off my...

3681
03:00:10,730 --> 03:00:11,670
Oh la la.

3682
03:00:12,130 --> 03:00:12,510
Oh la la.

3683
03:00:22,590 --> 03:00:25,670
What if one day I just streamed without my skirt?

3684
03:00:25,750 --> 03:00:25,770
What if one day I just streamed without my skirt?

3685
03:00:25,770 --> 03:00:26,310
You'd never know.

3686
03:00:29,210 --> 03:00:30,210
You'd never know.

3687
03:00:30,590 --> 03:00:32,190
How scandalous it is.

3688
03:00:32,810 --> 03:00:33,230
How scandalous it is.

3689
03:00:35,430 --> 03:00:37,690
Easy, breezy, beautiful cover girl.

3690
03:00:50,140 --> 03:00:50,660
Wait.

3691
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:54,700
Why did it change from a leaf to a block?

3692
03:00:54,700 --> 03:00:55,740
Why did it change from a leaf to a block?

3693
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:56,400
Why did it change from a leaf to a block?

3694
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:58,340
Oh my god, redstone!

3695
03:00:59,360 --> 03:00:59,880
Woohoo!

3696
03:01:08,490 --> 03:01:11,790
I thought the whole point of working from home is that pants are optional.

3697
03:01:12,190 --> 03:01:13,410
You're exactly right.

3698
03:01:16,090 --> 03:01:16,610
But...

3699
03:01:16,610 --> 03:01:17,210
You know...

3700
03:01:18,190 --> 03:01:20,890
I can't be off the clock for...

3701
03:01:20,890 --> 03:01:21,690
You know...

3702
03:01:22,290 --> 03:01:24,250
My master, my mistress...

3703
03:01:25,490 --> 03:01:26,430
I can't be...

3704
03:01:26,430 --> 03:01:27,350
I can't be so lazy.

3705
03:01:27,590 --> 03:01:27,970
Oh!

3706
03:01:29,770 --> 03:01:31,770
Wait, are we gonna be able to enchant stuff?

3707
03:01:34,490 --> 03:01:35,870
When am I gonna get a sheep?

3708
03:01:36,410 --> 03:01:38,630
Wait, that means we might be closer to diamonds.

3709
03:01:44,470 --> 03:01:45,690
What was the goal again?

3710
03:01:47,210 --> 03:01:48,350
Of the one block?

3711
03:01:49,450 --> 03:01:51,130
To defeat the ender dragon.

3712
03:01:51,350 --> 03:01:52,570
I think that's still the goal.

3713
03:01:53,770 --> 03:01:55,170
Haven't worn pants in days.

3714
03:01:55,570 --> 03:01:56,930
Love work from home.

3715
03:02:01,950 --> 03:02:03,510
Love work from home.

3716
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:03,590
Oh...

3717
03:02:05,450 --> 03:02:06,210
Oh, nice.

3718
03:02:07,590 --> 03:02:08,350
Melon seeds...

3719
03:02:08,350 --> 03:02:10,570
We can get a sponge, but what would we use a sponge for?

3720
03:02:11,610 --> 03:02:11,990
Hmm...

3721
03:02:14,950 --> 03:02:16,870
If you have 12 strings, you can make a bed.

3722
03:02:17,050 --> 03:02:17,530
No way!

3723
03:02:18,630 --> 03:02:19,370
I have 9!

3724
03:02:19,590 --> 03:02:21,070
Wait, we have a bamboo, right?

3725
03:02:21,130 --> 03:02:21,990
Bamboo can make string.

3726
03:02:24,410 --> 03:02:24,790
String...

3727
03:02:25,890 --> 03:02:26,950
Can we not make string?

3728
03:02:28,030 --> 03:02:29,850
I thought you could make string.

3729
03:02:30,830 --> 03:02:31,610
Am I crazy?

3730
03:02:36,350 --> 03:02:37,230
Oh, stripped.

3731
03:02:37,870 --> 03:02:38,890
Just like me.

3732
03:02:48,290 --> 03:02:49,490
Break cobwebs.

3733
03:02:49,630 --> 03:02:51,170
Well, we don't have any cobwebs.

3734
03:02:52,950 --> 03:02:54,090
Bamboo makes paper.

3735
03:02:54,210 --> 03:02:54,650
No!

3736
03:02:54,850 --> 03:02:55,670
I think...

3737
03:02:56,870 --> 03:02:58,930
The sugar can makes the paper.

3738
03:03:00,970 --> 03:03:01,570
Hmm...

3739
03:03:03,330 --> 03:03:04,930
Making string is in mods.

3740
03:03:05,350 --> 03:03:06,210
Oh, really?

3741
03:03:07,050 --> 03:03:08,150
I always thought.

3742
03:03:08,930 --> 03:03:10,590
That you could make string too.

3743
03:03:10,870 --> 03:03:11,810
Oh my god, wait.

3744
03:03:11,830 --> 03:03:13,630
I was gonna say this is gonna fill up, but...

3745
03:03:15,370 --> 03:03:16,870
We don't need it anymore.

3746
03:03:30,190 --> 03:03:31,390
We do need...

3747
03:03:31,390 --> 03:03:33,150
Just a little bit more string though.

3748
03:03:36,070 --> 03:03:37,490
Yeah, you useless.

3749
03:03:38,150 --> 03:03:39,550
You're useless to me.

3750
03:03:39,950 --> 03:03:41,170
You're useless to me.

3751
03:03:41,230 --> 03:03:41,650
You're useless.

3752
03:03:44,690 --> 03:03:45,250
Come here.

3753
03:03:45,510 --> 03:03:46,570
Don't run from me.

3754
03:03:46,870 --> 03:03:47,630
Where is the aim?

3755
03:03:49,950 --> 03:03:50,030
There we go.

3756
03:03:51,570 --> 03:03:52,370
Don't bully.

3757
03:03:53,030 --> 03:03:53,970
I wasn't.

3758
03:03:55,670 --> 03:03:56,950
I was sending him home.

3759
03:03:57,750 --> 03:03:58,270
Duh.

3760
03:04:00,810 --> 03:04:01,330
Useless.

3761
03:04:05,830 --> 03:04:06,350
Useless.

3762
03:04:18,230 --> 03:04:18,750
Hmm...

3763
03:04:20,590 --> 03:04:22,030
Sometimes I wish I could just...

3764
03:04:22,030 --> 03:04:23,630
Dig forever and not like...

3765
03:04:23,630 --> 03:04:24,310
Think about anything.

3766
03:04:24,590 --> 03:04:26,230
Wait, so since we have nothing else.

3767
03:04:26,250 --> 03:04:27,130
What about like enemies?

3768
03:04:27,250 --> 03:04:28,530
Do these guys not spawn either?

3769
03:04:31,710 --> 03:04:32,730
Oh my god!

3770
03:04:33,090 --> 03:04:33,610
Hallelujah!

3771
03:04:50,830 --> 03:04:52,190
Oh my gosh.

3772
03:04:52,250 --> 03:04:53,650
Wait, is this thing dead now?

3773
03:04:53,750 --> 03:04:55,130
Or will it spawn another melon?

3774
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:06,620
It'll regrow?

3775
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:07,720
Perfect!

3776
03:05:10,220 --> 03:05:12,080
Our little island is so cute.

3777
03:05:12,180 --> 03:05:12,720
Isn't it?

3778
03:05:13,020 --> 03:05:14,440
I love our little island.

3779
03:05:15,260 --> 03:05:16,900
I'm gonna grow a jungle.

3780
03:05:18,920 --> 03:05:19,720
Over here.

3781
03:05:24,120 --> 03:05:26,120
I don't know if these need more room.

3782
03:05:27,420 --> 03:05:27,980
Hmm...

3783
03:05:31,430 --> 03:05:31,990
Yeah.

3784
03:05:37,190 --> 03:05:37,750
Okay.

3785
03:05:38,270 --> 03:05:40,490
I'm just like wishing there was more...

3786
03:05:40,490 --> 03:05:41,790
That would spawn though.

3787
03:05:42,670 --> 03:05:44,630
Like before when I played it.

3788
03:05:44,910 --> 03:05:46,430
They would like give you stuff...

3789
03:05:46,430 --> 03:05:48,070
Every so often or like...

3790
03:05:48,070 --> 03:05:50,610
Animals would spawn or...

3791
03:05:50,610 --> 03:05:52,130
Maybe I need to play a different...

3792
03:05:52,130 --> 03:05:53,130
Version of it.

3793
03:05:53,170 --> 03:05:54,070
Everything's so different.

3794
03:05:54,570 --> 03:05:56,470
Like I feel like this is a little too...

3795
03:05:56,470 --> 03:05:58,190
Like I don't have any animals.

3796
03:05:59,910 --> 03:06:02,630
Mobs only spawn 24 plus blocks...

3797
03:06:02,630 --> 03:06:03,210
Away.

3798
03:06:03,310 --> 03:06:04,790
So if you make a lit...

3799
03:06:04,790 --> 03:06:06,710
Grass platform out...

3800
03:06:06,710 --> 03:06:07,570
Cows might spawn.

3801
03:06:08,170 --> 03:06:08,830
Oh!

3802
03:06:09,910 --> 03:06:11,170
Let's try that then.

3803
03:06:13,070 --> 03:06:14,650
I don't know how far...

3804
03:06:14,650 --> 03:06:16,950
Out I actually am but...

3805
03:06:20,130 --> 03:06:20,790
Hmm...

3806
03:06:21,970 --> 03:06:23,430
Make the platform bigger?

3807
03:06:23,430 --> 03:06:23,890
Okay.

3808
03:06:26,950 --> 03:06:28,410
Oh I was like what is that?

3809
03:06:28,970 --> 03:06:30,330
What is that floating away?

3810
03:06:36,070 --> 03:06:36,490
Oh.

3811
03:06:36,490 --> 03:06:37,770
I think we're gonna have to start...

3812
03:06:37,770 --> 03:06:38,810
Using other materials.

3813
03:06:40,530 --> 03:06:41,370
Oh yeah!

3814
03:06:41,470 --> 03:06:42,870
This thing grew so quickly!

3815
03:06:49,330 --> 03:06:49,930
Let's see.

3816
03:06:50,130 --> 03:06:51,650
We might need to start using other...

3817
03:06:51,650 --> 03:06:52,210
Materials.

3818
03:06:53,690 --> 03:06:54,710
Might be time.

3819
03:06:55,490 --> 03:06:57,390
I'm gonna put the sand away so I don't accidentally...

3820
03:06:57,390 --> 03:06:59,410
Place it and be stupid about it.

3821
03:07:01,270 --> 03:07:01,750
Ummm...

3822
03:07:03,170 --> 03:07:03,650
Ummm...

3823
03:07:03,650 --> 03:07:05,230
Let's just put down some oak planks.

3824
03:07:09,880 --> 03:07:11,560
Wait I want some more dirt first.

3825
03:07:15,290 --> 03:07:16,770
So it's a little more cohesive.

3826
03:07:17,870 --> 03:07:19,630
Wait are we not gonna get dirt anymore?

3827
03:07:19,930 --> 03:07:20,270
Uh oh.

3828
03:07:20,390 --> 03:07:21,670
Oh we got some dirt!

3829
03:07:25,430 --> 03:07:26,850
You'll get hostile mobs.

3830
03:07:26,910 --> 03:07:27,870
Yeah yeah no worries!

3831
03:07:29,190 --> 03:07:30,370
Only spawn on...

3832
03:07:30,370 --> 03:07:31,990
They do only spawn on the grass!

3833
03:07:32,930 --> 03:07:33,410
Okay.

3834
03:07:34,330 --> 03:07:34,810
Alright.

3835
03:07:35,450 --> 03:07:36,750
Then we'll have to build out.

3836
03:07:38,330 --> 03:07:39,610
Autobots build out!

3837
03:07:40,770 --> 03:07:41,310
Okay.

3838
03:07:57,090 --> 03:07:58,430
Just a little bit more.

3839
03:07:58,970 --> 03:08:00,330
Just a little bit more.

3840
03:08:01,590 --> 03:08:02,970
Just a little bit more.

3841
03:08:02,970 --> 03:08:04,030
Oops wrong thing.

3842
03:08:04,450 --> 03:08:05,550
Little bit more!

3843
03:08:07,230 --> 03:08:07,770
Hmm.

3844
03:08:08,130 --> 03:08:08,510
Hmm.

3845
03:08:11,010 --> 03:08:13,610
I think the biggest pain is switching between...

3846
03:08:13,610 --> 03:08:15,270
The different things.

3847
03:08:15,350 --> 03:08:15,970
You know what I mean?

3848
03:08:15,970 --> 03:08:18,950
Let's also start cooking some of this...

3849
03:08:18,950 --> 03:08:19,410
Uh...

3850
03:08:19,850 --> 03:08:20,190
Gold!

3851
03:08:20,630 --> 03:08:22,390
So we can sell it!

3852
03:08:23,790 --> 03:08:24,490
And dirt!

3853
03:08:25,110 --> 03:08:26,790
So we can build it!

3854
03:08:27,750 --> 03:08:28,090
Choo!

3855
03:08:28,110 --> 03:08:28,570
Choo!

3856
03:08:28,570 --> 03:08:29,250
Choo!

3857
03:08:29,330 --> 03:08:30,210
Okay nice!

3858
03:08:30,470 --> 03:08:31,930
And light it up baby!

3859
03:08:32,570 --> 03:08:33,790
Light it up!

3860
03:08:33,870 --> 03:08:34,350
Baby!

3861
03:08:36,390 --> 03:08:37,070
Umm...

3862
03:08:37,930 --> 03:08:38,270
Uh...

3863
03:08:38,270 --> 03:08:39,130
You!

3864
03:08:41,150 --> 03:08:41,830
And...

3865
03:08:41,830 --> 03:08:42,570
Uh...

3866
03:08:43,610 --> 03:08:44,110
What's it called?

3867
03:08:44,390 --> 03:08:44,990
Torch!

3868
03:08:51,890 --> 03:08:53,990
Feels so weird playing Minecraft again.

3869
03:08:55,030 --> 03:08:56,910
Even though it's like not actual Minecraft.

3870
03:08:57,630 --> 03:08:58,790
Feels so weird.

3871
03:08:59,950 --> 03:09:00,910
Even like...

3872
03:09:00,910 --> 03:09:02,790
Touching the game again in some capacity.

3873
03:09:04,530 --> 03:09:06,650
Since I haven't played it in so long.

3874
03:09:11,730 --> 03:09:12,610
I think...

3875
03:09:12,610 --> 03:09:15,510
I think my brain riot was replaced with...

3876
03:09:15,510 --> 03:09:16,590
Bloons honestly.

3877
03:09:18,970 --> 03:09:19,510
Also...

3878
03:09:19,510 --> 03:09:20,190
It's kind of...

3879
03:09:20,190 --> 03:09:21,510
You know it's hard to play Minecraft.

3880
03:09:22,130 --> 03:09:24,910
I know some people prefer solo but...

3881
03:09:26,470 --> 03:09:27,510
It's hard...

3882
03:09:27,510 --> 03:09:29,130
It's hard when like...

3883
03:09:29,130 --> 03:09:30,530
Do you need string?

3884
03:09:31,490 --> 03:09:32,450
Turtle scoot!

3885
03:09:33,750 --> 03:09:35,350
It's hard playing by yourself though.

3886
03:09:35,470 --> 03:09:35,630
You know?

3887
03:09:42,340 --> 03:09:44,580
Have you been on the Beat Shoujo server recently?

3888
03:09:45,200 --> 03:09:46,080
I'll be honest.

3889
03:09:46,180 --> 03:09:47,420
I haven't been on since I...

3890
03:09:47,420 --> 03:09:48,860
Went that first time.

3891
03:09:50,500 --> 03:09:51,440
It's just...

3892
03:09:51,440 --> 03:09:53,060
It's just uh...

3893
03:09:53,720 --> 03:09:54,340
Uh...

3894
03:09:54,340 --> 03:09:56,860
I feel a little awkward about it.

3895
03:09:56,940 --> 03:09:57,340
I'm just like...

3896
03:09:57,340 --> 03:09:58,660
I don't know if I'm...

3897
03:09:58,660 --> 03:10:00,720
I feel awkward like building in there.

3898
03:10:06,460 --> 03:10:08,080
Anti-social minthos.

3899
03:10:09,180 --> 03:10:10,120
I can't!

3900
03:10:10,180 --> 03:10:10,860
I'm sorry!

3901
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:12,640
I'm so anti-social!

3902
03:10:17,150 --> 03:10:18,230
Haunting the server.

3903
03:10:22,590 --> 03:10:23,690
You're welcome there.

3904
03:10:23,770 --> 03:10:24,190
Just go.

3905
03:10:26,190 --> 03:10:28,310
They haven't made me feel unwelcome.

3906
03:10:28,850 --> 03:10:29,530
You know?

3907
03:10:29,570 --> 03:10:31,870
Not in any ways at all.

3908
03:10:32,470 --> 03:10:33,650
It's just you know me.

3909
03:10:33,830 --> 03:10:34,750
Being like...

3910
03:10:35,990 --> 03:10:36,990
Is it okay?

3911
03:10:38,090 --> 03:10:40,230
Also all the mods do kind of...

3912
03:10:40,230 --> 03:10:40,810
Freak me out.

3913
03:10:42,250 --> 03:10:43,250
There's so many.

3914
03:10:44,870 --> 03:10:46,150
But maybe I should just...

3915
03:10:46,150 --> 03:10:48,450
Go in some time off stream and...

3916
03:10:48,450 --> 03:10:49,070
Um...

3917
03:10:49,070 --> 03:10:51,110
Try and get used to it a bit more.

3918
03:10:52,510 --> 03:10:52,990
Hmm...

3919
03:11:06,370 --> 03:11:07,330
VSMP streams.

3920
03:11:07,750 --> 03:11:09,550
Yeah but I was invited to that.

3921
03:11:09,810 --> 03:11:10,270
So...

3922
03:11:10,830 --> 03:11:12,490
And I'm not gonna be like...

3923
03:11:12,490 --> 03:11:13,130
Let me in!

3924
03:11:14,930 --> 03:11:16,090
Let me in!

3925
03:11:20,100 --> 03:11:20,820
Are they...

3926
03:11:20,820 --> 03:11:22,040
I don't even know if they're still playing.

3927
03:11:24,340 --> 03:11:26,060
Are you winning your block game?

3928
03:11:26,360 --> 03:11:27,160
I think so.

3929
03:11:27,800 --> 03:11:28,940
I think we're winning.

3930
03:11:30,580 --> 03:11:31,440
I think we're winning.

3931
03:11:32,220 --> 03:11:32,980
Yeah.

3932
03:11:34,360 --> 03:11:35,120
Oh.

3933
03:11:35,180 --> 03:11:36,160
Minecraft music.

3934
03:11:40,360 --> 03:11:41,320
Bees work.

3935
03:11:41,560 --> 03:11:42,380
Rain falls.

3936
03:11:44,340 --> 03:11:45,640
Need more dirt.

3937
03:11:45,860 --> 03:11:48,460
How far is 24 blocks out you think?

3938
03:11:53,970 --> 03:11:54,750
How far is 24 blocks out you think?

3939
03:11:55,310 --> 03:11:56,070
Two.

3940
03:11:56,270 --> 03:11:56,750
Three.

3941
03:11:57,190 --> 03:11:57,950
Four.

3942
03:11:58,090 --> 03:11:58,630
Five.

3943
03:11:58,850 --> 03:11:59,430
Six.

3944
03:11:59,610 --> 03:12:00,190
Seven.

3945
03:12:00,370 --> 03:12:00,930
Eight.

3946
03:12:01,070 --> 03:12:01,510
Nine.

3947
03:12:01,690 --> 03:12:02,110
Ten.

3948
03:12:02,190 --> 03:12:02,690
Eleven.

3949
03:12:02,910 --> 03:12:03,330
Twelve.

3950
03:12:03,530 --> 03:12:04,030
Thirteen.

3951
03:12:04,150 --> 03:12:04,610
Fourteen.

3952
03:12:04,890 --> 03:12:05,650
Fifteen!

3953
03:12:11,330 --> 03:12:12,450
Oh shucks.

3954
03:12:12,930 --> 03:12:13,490
Hahaha.

3955
03:12:17,750 --> 03:12:18,310
Hahaha.

3956
03:12:18,970 --> 03:12:19,770
Uh oh.

3957
03:12:24,230 --> 03:12:26,110
Yeah we're gonna have to make it...

3958
03:12:26,110 --> 03:12:28,070
We're gonna... We won't fill this in.

3959
03:12:28,930 --> 03:12:30,530
We're just gonna have to make it...

3960
03:12:31,250 --> 03:12:31,810
Skinny.

3961
03:12:32,010 --> 03:12:32,810
Skinny legend.

3962
03:12:37,910 --> 03:12:39,010
We get barely...

3963
03:12:39,010 --> 03:12:40,270
Any dirt anymore though.

3964
03:12:41,130 --> 03:12:41,690
Oh!

3965
03:12:41,710 --> 03:12:43,390
I say that and they start giving...

3966
03:12:43,390 --> 03:12:44,070
You know what?

3967
03:12:44,090 --> 03:12:45,090
It's funnier than 24 blocks.

3968
03:12:45,970 --> 03:12:47,010
I'm not gonna...

3969
03:12:47,010 --> 03:12:47,870
Oh my gosh.

3970
03:12:48,350 --> 03:12:49,990
I'm not gonna say the joke.

3971
03:12:50,250 --> 03:12:51,350
I think I know.

3972
03:12:51,590 --> 03:12:52,990
But you can say it.

3973
03:12:54,950 --> 03:12:57,350
You guys don't guess in the chat.

3974
03:13:04,580 --> 03:13:05,460
Twenty five.

3975
03:13:05,980 --> 03:13:06,500
Twenty five.

3976
03:13:20,020 --> 03:13:21,160
Good one boys.

3977
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:22,120
Hahaha.

3978
03:13:28,280 --> 03:13:28,840
Hahaha.

3979
03:13:28,840 --> 03:13:29,060
Hahaha.

3980
03:13:33,130 --> 03:13:33,710
Okay.

3981
03:13:37,170 --> 03:13:39,870
How much more dirt do we have now?

3982
03:13:40,950 --> 03:13:41,910
Ten dirt!

3983
03:13:43,770 --> 03:13:45,930
And we have none in here, right?

3984
03:13:46,130 --> 03:13:46,790
Oh no.

3985
03:13:47,970 --> 03:13:49,130
Oh shucks.

3986
03:13:49,790 --> 03:13:51,810
Maybe I should steal some from over here.

3987
03:13:56,490 --> 03:13:57,610
Oh come on!

3988
03:13:57,870 --> 03:13:58,450
What

3989
03:14:24,680 --> 03:14:27,220
do you buy with gold?

3990
03:14:27,220 --> 03:14:27,480
Nothing?

3991
03:14:27,900 --> 03:14:28,140
Okay.

3992
03:14:29,080 --> 03:14:30,840
All my iron.

3993
03:14:45,620 --> 03:14:47,340
I lost everything!

3994
03:14:47,840 --> 03:14:49,040
I can't even...

3995
03:14:55,750 --> 03:14:56,590
I

3996
03:15:08,610 --> 03:15:10,570
lost all my new dirt!

3997
03:15:11,150 --> 03:15:12,250
I lost...

3998
03:15:12,250 --> 03:15:13,270
I lost it all.

3999
03:15:14,150 --> 03:15:15,870
I lost it all.

4000
03:15:20,030 --> 03:15:22,230
You still have us?

4001
03:15:26,010 --> 03:15:27,510
All for a bit of dirt.

4002
03:15:27,850 --> 03:15:28,370
All for a bit of dirt.

4003
03:15:30,810 --> 03:15:33,130
We're going back to the stone age with this one.

4004
03:15:33,250 --> 03:15:33,690
I know!

4005
03:15:34,170 --> 03:15:34,930
Oh my god.

4006
03:15:35,990 --> 03:15:37,530
Let's get our wooden pickaxe.

4007
03:15:37,690 --> 03:15:39,070
Not even stone age.

4008
03:15:39,330 --> 03:15:39,510
Wait.

4009
03:15:39,550 --> 03:15:40,210
Can I make stone?

4010
03:15:40,530 --> 03:15:41,010
Oh we can.

4011
03:15:41,030 --> 03:15:42,210
We can make stone.

4012
03:15:43,230 --> 03:15:43,670
Stone.

4013
03:15:46,510 --> 03:15:46,950
Stone.

4014
03:15:49,350 --> 03:15:49,790
Stone.

4015
03:15:49,930 --> 03:15:50,210
Stone.

4016
03:15:52,250 --> 03:15:53,010
You're so cute.

4017
03:15:54,170 --> 03:15:55,050
I like your scent so much.

4018
03:15:57,270 --> 03:15:59,310
Why are you super chatting me very?

4019
03:16:02,830 --> 03:16:04,070
What's wrong with you?

4020
03:16:12,950 --> 03:16:14,470
You paid for dinner!

4021
03:16:14,750 --> 03:16:14,970
So?

4022
03:16:18,750 --> 03:16:20,470
You lent me cash!

4023
03:16:20,470 --> 03:16:20,930
Cash!

4024
03:16:28,560 --> 03:16:29,520
No gold!

4025
03:16:30,160 --> 03:16:30,260
Huh?

4026
03:16:32,560 --> 03:16:33,780
Nothing of use.

4027
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:35,360
Why can't they sell dirt?

4028
03:16:42,890 --> 03:16:44,810
I can't even get the redstone.

4029
03:16:44,950 --> 03:16:46,590
I don't think I put any of the redstone.

4030
03:16:46,650 --> 03:16:46,890
Nope.

4031
03:16:46,890 --> 03:16:48,470
I didn't put a single redstone away.

4032
03:16:49,830 --> 03:16:50,990
Oh my gosh you guys.

4033
03:16:50,990 --> 03:16:53,170
Are we going to be able to work like this?

4034
03:16:53,670 --> 03:16:55,330
We're going to have no tools.

4035
03:16:55,610 --> 03:16:57,210
They're giving us barely any iron.

4036
03:17:06,310 --> 03:17:07,770
At least we can get these.

4037
03:17:09,210 --> 03:17:10,450
Just a minor setback.

4038
03:17:11,110 --> 03:17:12,590
Just a minor setback.

4039
03:17:12,950 --> 03:17:14,250
We'll make it back guys.

4040
03:17:14,450 --> 03:17:14,770
Believe.

4041
03:17:16,950 --> 03:17:17,910
Believe it.

4042
03:17:20,450 --> 03:17:21,170
Oh my god.

4043
03:17:21,210 --> 03:17:23,010
We don't even get the...

4044
03:17:23,010 --> 03:17:24,010
Oh more iron.

4045
03:17:35,820 --> 03:17:36,480
More iron.

4046
03:17:36,480 --> 03:17:37,180
Okay more iron.

4047
03:17:37,580 --> 03:17:39,220
Okay we're going to start cooking.

4048
03:17:39,700 --> 03:17:41,840
We're going to start cooking that iron up.

4049
03:17:42,180 --> 03:17:43,000
Let's start.

4050
03:17:45,280 --> 03:17:47,400
Iron's back on the menu baby.

4051
03:17:47,740 --> 03:17:49,000
Of course it is.

4052
03:17:50,080 --> 03:17:52,080
You can make dirt out of oak saplings.

4053
03:17:52,540 --> 03:17:53,420
No way.

4054
03:17:59,010 --> 03:18:01,830
I lost all my saplings though.

4055
03:18:02,610 --> 03:18:03,610
Wait what?

4056
03:18:04,520 --> 03:18:05,170
Since when?

4057
03:18:07,390 --> 03:18:10,370
I guess I've never needed to make so much dirt before.

4058
03:18:10,790 --> 03:18:10,950
I guess I've never needed to make so much dirt before.

4059
03:18:12,510 --> 03:18:14,130
When could you do that?

4060
03:18:14,810 --> 03:18:15,730
Since when?

4061
03:18:16,270 --> 03:18:16,370
Since when?

4062
03:18:29,460 --> 03:18:30,700
Is that a mod?

4063
03:18:30,940 --> 03:18:31,420
Is that a mod?

4064
03:18:32,240 --> 03:18:33,200
Is that special?

4065
03:18:35,460 --> 03:18:37,700
Is it for this one block?

4066
03:18:38,020 --> 03:18:39,360
Is it for this one block?

4067
03:18:39,360 --> 03:18:40,180
Oh my god.

4068
03:18:41,280 --> 03:18:42,420
Oh my god.

4069
03:18:44,920 --> 03:18:46,100
Oh my god.

4070
03:18:46,100 --> 03:18:46,220
Oh my god.

4071
03:18:47,440 --> 03:18:48,820
We're back to 11 dirt.

4072
03:18:51,820 --> 03:18:53,040
Maybe only in one block.

4073
03:18:53,120 --> 03:18:54,740
I think I lost all my torches too.

4074
03:19:06,880 --> 03:19:07,800
Infinite dirt.

4075
03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:10,600
I just wanted to close it up.

4076
03:19:14,640 --> 03:19:15,680
Monsters don't worry.

4077
03:19:15,680 --> 03:19:16,340
Don't worry.

4078
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:19,080
Did I lose all my coal?

4079
03:19:19,320 --> 03:19:21,140
Why was I holding onto everything?

4080
03:19:23,220 --> 03:19:24,660
What's wrong with me?

4081
03:19:25,060 --> 03:19:26,960
I didn't put a single thing in here.

4082
03:19:27,220 --> 03:19:28,200
Oh here's some coal.

4083
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:31,520
Torch.

4084
03:19:33,620 --> 03:19:34,340
There we go.

4085
03:19:38,040 --> 03:19:39,120
You are eepy.

4086
03:19:39,440 --> 03:19:40,340
That is true.

4087
03:19:40,660 --> 03:19:41,820
I'm very eepy.

4088
03:19:44,020 --> 03:19:47,320
Maybe the eepiest ghost in the wild wild west.

4089
03:19:47,480 --> 03:19:47,700
Maybe the eepiest ghost in the wild wild west.

4090
03:19:49,500 --> 03:19:50,060
Alright.

4091
03:19:50,100 --> 03:19:51,060
Now while that works.

4092
03:19:51,940 --> 03:19:53,500
Sorry I'm late to stream.

4093
03:19:53,720 --> 03:19:53,960
No.

4094
03:19:54,100 --> 03:19:55,000
Why would you apologize?

4095
03:19:55,620 --> 03:19:58,560
Giving the last presentation of my time as an undergrad.

4096
03:19:58,920 --> 03:20:01,880
Finally I have my biomedical engineering degree.

4097
03:20:03,620 --> 03:20:04,540
Oh my god.

4098
03:20:04,740 --> 03:20:05,580
You're so smart.

4099
03:20:06,920 --> 03:20:07,480
Congratulations.

4100
03:20:08,440 --> 03:20:09,560
Cece McShaggy.

4101
03:20:12,520 --> 03:20:13,980
That's the funniest name.

4102
03:20:15,260 --> 03:20:17,180
Dr. Cece McShaggy.

4103
03:20:17,240 --> 03:20:17,700
Dr. Cece McShaggy.

4104
03:20:17,720 --> 03:20:18,360
Congrats.

4105
03:20:22,220 --> 03:20:22,700
Biomed.

4106
03:20:23,660 --> 03:20:25,100
Why are you watching me?

4107
03:20:25,400 --> 03:20:27,920
You watch me to make yourself feel better right?

4108
03:20:28,040 --> 03:20:30,040
You're just like god at least I'm not as dumb as her.

4109
03:20:31,540 --> 03:20:33,700
What a dumb.

4110
03:20:33,980 --> 03:20:35,380
She's like a pile of rocks.

4111
03:20:36,060 --> 03:20:36,980
I get it.

4112
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:37,580
I get it.

4113
03:20:38,600 --> 03:20:39,380
I know.

4114
03:20:42,880 --> 03:20:44,440
Congrats fellow STEM major.

4115
03:20:47,180 --> 03:20:47,660
So.

4116
03:20:47,720 --> 03:20:49,420
Smart people do not interact.

4117
03:20:49,840 --> 03:20:50,940
Do not watch me.

4118
03:20:51,100 --> 03:20:52,720
Do not pay attention to me.

4119
03:20:53,080 --> 03:20:54,420
I don't want your judgement.

4120
03:20:55,060 --> 03:20:58,300
They're like, did you see that she couldn't even spell cauldron.

4121
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:03,980
She tried getting the dirt.

4122
03:21:04,060 --> 03:21:05,220
It fell into the void.

4123
03:21:05,720 --> 03:21:06,920
What a bozo.

4124
03:21:11,600 --> 03:21:13,280
I've been watching for years.

4125
03:21:13,380 --> 03:21:14,100
It's too late.

4126
03:21:15,340 --> 03:21:16,640
Thank god I'm an idiot.

4127
03:21:17,720 --> 03:21:18,420
Let's rise up.

4128
03:21:25,940 --> 03:21:27,600
STEM majors can't spell either.

4129
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:30,000
Maybe I am a genius.

4130
03:21:30,440 --> 03:21:32,240
I do have a genius emote.

4131
03:21:35,080 --> 03:21:36,280
Guess I should leave then.

4132
03:21:36,460 --> 03:21:36,840
No, no.

4133
03:21:36,860 --> 03:21:37,620
You're right at home.

4134
03:21:39,440 --> 03:21:40,600
You're right at home.

4135
03:21:42,780 --> 03:21:44,140
Hello fellow dummies.

4136
03:21:48,940 --> 03:21:50,680
My fellow idiots.

4137
03:21:50,680 --> 03:21:53,460
We gather here today.

4138
03:21:53,640 --> 03:21:54,900
In joyous.

4139
03:21:56,300 --> 03:21:58,040
In joyous.

4140
03:21:58,040 --> 03:21:58,800
In joyous.

4141
03:21:58,800 --> 03:21:59,600
Celebratory.

4142
03:22:01,640 --> 03:22:02,520
Extravaganza.

4143
03:22:03,020 --> 03:22:04,960
As we grieve.

4144
03:22:05,380 --> 03:22:07,160
Our fellow.

4145
03:22:08,500 --> 03:22:08,940
Smarties.

4146
03:22:11,340 --> 03:22:13,300
For they are too smart.

4147
03:22:15,300 --> 03:22:17,360
And therefore must be.

4148
03:22:17,660 --> 03:22:18,540
Executed.

4149
03:22:23,470 --> 03:22:25,010
Time to drain my brain cells.

4150
03:22:25,070 --> 03:22:25,650
From my oshi.

4151
03:22:26,930 --> 03:22:27,370
Yeah.

4152
03:22:28,130 --> 03:22:29,010
Get stupid.

4153
03:22:29,210 --> 03:22:29,690
Get stupid.

4154
03:22:31,210 --> 03:22:33,710
You should be a little stupid around your oshi though.

4155
03:22:33,790 --> 03:22:34,050
Right?

4156
03:22:35,330 --> 03:22:37,150
It's kinda like when you're around your crush.

4157
03:22:37,490 --> 03:22:39,330
You gotta be a little stupid around your oshi.

4158
03:22:48,670 --> 03:22:50,250
Mint does make me stupider.

4159
03:22:52,030 --> 03:22:53,170
Then I'm doing my job.

4160
03:22:53,230 --> 03:22:54,050
Mint does make me stupider.

4161
03:22:54,050 --> 03:22:54,050
Then I'm doing my job.

4162
03:22:54,470 --> 03:22:56,730
You should lose some brain cells.

4163
03:22:57,170 --> 03:22:57,350
You know?

4164
03:23:03,680 --> 03:23:04,880
But I'm stupid already?

4165
03:23:05,560 --> 03:23:06,580
Then it's working.

4166
03:23:07,580 --> 03:23:08,500
Don't worry Mint.

4167
03:23:08,560 --> 03:23:12,160
I've been working in STEM as a testing engineer for a few years now.

4168
03:23:12,380 --> 03:23:13,840
There's plenty of idiots here.

4169
03:23:15,360 --> 03:23:16,020
There's plenty of idiots here.

4170
03:23:16,020 --> 03:23:16,360
Sounds personal.

4171
03:23:16,680 --> 03:23:17,600
Sounds like...

4172
03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:20,500
How many...

4173
03:23:20,500 --> 03:23:21,600
How far are we out?

4174
03:23:21,740 --> 03:23:22,080
Let's see.

4175
03:23:24,860 --> 03:23:25,140
One.

4176
03:23:25,260 --> 03:23:25,740
Two.

4177
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:26,560
Three.

4178
03:23:26,560 --> 03:23:26,820
Four.

4179
03:23:27,380 --> 03:23:27,840
Five.

4180
03:23:28,040 --> 03:23:28,380
Six.

4181
03:23:28,560 --> 03:23:29,020
Seven.

4182
03:23:29,160 --> 03:23:29,600
Eight.

4183
03:23:29,700 --> 03:23:30,160
Nine.

4184
03:23:30,360 --> 03:23:30,800
Ten.

4185
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:31,460
Eleven.

4186
03:23:31,780 --> 03:23:32,220
Twelve.

4187
03:23:32,480 --> 03:23:32,980
Thirteen.

4188
03:23:33,160 --> 03:23:33,600
Fourteen.

4189
03:23:33,740 --> 03:23:34,180
Fifteen.

4190
03:23:34,260 --> 03:23:34,740
Sixteen.

4191
03:23:34,800 --> 03:23:35,200
Seventeen.

4192
03:23:35,460 --> 03:23:36,140
Eighteen.

4193
03:23:36,260 --> 03:23:36,940
Nineteen.

4194
03:23:36,960 --> 03:23:37,280
Twenty.

4195
03:23:37,580 --> 03:23:40,040
Why did

4196
03:24:03,010 --> 03:24:05,190
he have to appear right there at that time?

4197
03:24:05,210 --> 03:24:05,950
At that moment?

4198
03:24:09,050 --> 03:24:10,470
Oh my god.

4199
03:24:11,550 --> 03:24:13,070
Oh my god.

4200
03:24:13,230 --> 03:24:14,270
Scared the...

4201
03:24:14,270 --> 03:24:16,050
Oh my god.

4202
03:24:16,050 --> 03:24:17,470
Scared me so bad.

4203
03:24:17,470 --> 03:24:19,010
We can order a cow though.

4204
03:24:19,070 --> 03:24:19,950
We can order a cow.

4205
03:24:20,870 --> 03:24:21,350
Soon.

4206
03:24:21,470 --> 03:24:22,110
I think.

4207
03:24:23,410 --> 03:24:24,990
We just gotta get more gold.

4208
03:24:25,030 --> 03:24:26,650
And we gotta be able to mine it.

4209
03:24:28,090 --> 03:24:29,090
Where was I?

4210
03:24:29,210 --> 03:24:30,090
I lost cow.

4211
03:24:30,470 --> 03:24:30,950
One.

4212
03:24:32,010 --> 03:24:32,490
Two.

4213
03:24:32,610 --> 03:24:33,030
Three.

4214
03:24:33,270 --> 03:24:33,750
Four.

4215
03:24:33,830 --> 03:24:34,250
Five.

4216
03:24:34,430 --> 03:24:34,910
Six.

4217
03:24:34,970 --> 03:24:35,310
Seven.

4218
03:24:35,590 --> 03:24:36,050
Eight.

4219
03:24:36,170 --> 03:24:36,630
Nine.

4220
03:24:36,770 --> 03:24:37,070
Ten.

4221
03:24:37,190 --> 03:24:37,650
Eleven.

4222
03:24:37,910 --> 03:24:38,330
Twelve.

4223
03:24:38,510 --> 03:24:38,990
Thirteen.

4224
03:24:39,090 --> 03:24:39,550
Fourteen.

4225
03:24:39,670 --> 03:24:40,150
Fifteen.

4226
03:24:40,310 --> 03:24:40,790
Sixteen.

4227
03:24:40,790 --> 03:24:41,150
Seventeen.

4228
03:24:41,330 --> 03:24:41,810
Eighteen.

4229
03:24:41,930 --> 03:24:42,410
Nineteen.

4230
03:24:42,450 --> 03:24:42,810
Twenty.

4231
03:24:42,950 --> 03:24:43,390
Twenty-one.

4232
03:24:43,530 --> 03:24:43,970
Twenty-two.

4233
03:24:44,030 --> 03:24:44,510
Twenty-three.

4234
03:24:44,550 --> 03:24:45,170
Twenty-four!

4235
03:24:47,470 --> 03:24:47,650
Twenty -five.

4236
03:24:48,450 --> 03:24:50,910
You can make infinite dirt but you'll lose gravel.

4237
03:24:51,110 --> 03:24:54,330
Just make coarse dirt and you can get two more dirt by breaking it.

4238
03:24:54,490 --> 03:24:56,030
I know too much about Minecraft.

4239
03:24:59,030 --> 03:25:01,450
Or I can turn these...

4240
03:25:01,450 --> 03:25:02,170
Look!

4241
03:25:02,330 --> 03:25:03,090
It's our jungle tree!

4242
03:25:06,190 --> 03:25:08,170
I can turn these into dirt.

4243
03:25:13,430 --> 03:25:15,510
I was hoping for another jump scare.

4244
03:25:15,690 --> 03:25:16,370
What are you?

4245
03:25:16,470 --> 03:25:17,470
A sadist?

4246
03:25:19,030 --> 03:25:21,110
Those people that watched were masochists.

4247
03:25:21,210 --> 03:25:24,390
Are you a sadist or a masochist?

4248
03:25:26,890 --> 03:25:28,110
Which are you?

4249
03:25:32,870 --> 03:25:34,290
Why not both?

4250
03:25:39,670 --> 03:25:41,910
I'm a normal person.

4251
03:25:44,030 --> 03:25:44,950
Both?

4252
03:25:45,050 --> 03:25:45,430
Really?

4253
03:25:49,260 --> 03:25:50,660
Pull time!

4254
03:25:51,320 --> 03:25:57,730
For my Oshi I can M.

4255
03:25:57,950 --> 03:25:59,230
That's so...

4256
03:26:00,170 --> 03:26:01,290
That's so real.

4257
03:26:01,510 --> 03:26:02,630
It's probably the realest thing...

4258
03:26:03,290 --> 03:26:03,870
PUMPKINS!

4259
03:26:04,270 --> 03:26:06,290
Probably the realest thing you've ever said.

4260
03:26:07,250 --> 03:26:08,710
Put this pumpkin away.

4261
03:26:14,330 --> 03:26:18,750
I work for a cybersecurity company and our business partner was pretty stupid last Friday.

4262
03:26:19,270 --> 03:26:21,690
You're smarter than Cloud Strife.

4263
03:26:24,590 --> 03:26:26,750
Thank you Devlin for the ego boost.

4264
03:26:27,490 --> 03:26:28,290
Thank you.

4265
03:26:30,930 --> 03:26:33,270
Let's grab some more dirt.

4266
03:26:37,100 --> 03:26:38,080
More dirt.

4267
03:26:41,880 --> 03:26:42,860
More dirt.

4268
03:26:49,190 --> 03:26:50,310
Feels good.

4269
03:26:53,820 --> 03:26:54,420
Hmm.

4270
03:26:55,140 --> 03:26:57,640
Normally I'd M but your suffering is very entertaining.

4271
03:27:00,040 --> 03:27:01,040
Oh so it's only...

4272
03:27:01,040 --> 03:27:02,880
It's only when it's me...

4273
03:27:02,880 --> 03:27:03,180
Okay.

4274
03:27:03,180 --> 03:27:03,220
Okay.

4275
03:27:06,380 --> 03:27:07,420
Dirt Phantom.

4276
03:27:08,820 --> 03:27:09,940
What do you want?

4277
03:27:10,180 --> 03:27:11,780
What do you want from me?

4278
03:27:11,860 --> 03:27:13,580
Do you also like to see my suffering?

4279
03:27:17,960 --> 03:27:20,520
I like to see your suffering too.

4280
03:27:25,140 --> 03:27:27,900
I don't think we can be amorous with no brain cells.

4281
03:27:28,240 --> 03:27:28,620
True?

4282
03:27:37,640 --> 03:27:38,580
Where are the cows?

4283
03:27:43,010 --> 03:27:44,190
Moo if you're a cow.

4284
03:27:45,450 --> 03:27:45,970
Moo.

4285
03:27:54,030 --> 03:27:55,030
Moo.

4286
03:28:13,350 --> 03:28:13,990
Moo.

4287
03:28:14,210 --> 03:28:14,370
Moo.

4288
03:28:17,980 --> 03:28:18,980
Moo.

4289
03:28:18,980 --> 03:28:19,040
Moo.

4290
03:28:19,040 --> 03:28:19,900
Moo.

4291
03:28:19,900 --> 03:28:20,260
Moo.

4292
03:28:20,260 --> 03:28:20,600
Moo.

4293
03:28:21,060 --> 03:28:22,340
What's the chat summary?

4294
03:28:33,190 --> 03:28:34,690
Oh, I think it's time.

4295
03:28:34,790 --> 03:28:36,930
I think we can actually make some... yeah.

4296
03:28:37,250 --> 03:28:38,810
Let's remake our stuff.

4297
03:28:40,810 --> 03:28:43,110
Iron pickaxe is most important.

4298
03:28:45,130 --> 03:28:46,330
Go away stone.

4299
03:28:46,910 --> 03:28:48,210
Go away stone.

4300
03:28:49,010 --> 03:28:51,470
And our iron axe.

4301
03:28:51,950 --> 03:28:53,970
And our iron shovel.

4302
03:28:54,670 --> 03:28:56,530
Everything stone be gone.

4303
03:28:56,970 --> 03:28:58,710
What are we in the stone age?

4304
03:29:01,610 --> 03:29:02,390
There we go.

4305
03:29:03,570 --> 03:29:04,710
It's so swift.

4306
03:29:06,230 --> 03:29:08,230
Happy to be here for three months.

4307
03:29:08,610 --> 03:29:10,490
Happy to have you for three months.

4308
03:29:10,610 --> 03:29:11,430
Thank you.

4309
03:29:13,790 --> 03:29:14,490
Thank you.

4310
03:29:14,650 --> 03:29:14,950
Thank you.

4311
03:29:17,590 --> 03:29:18,110
Nice.

4312
03:29:18,210 --> 03:29:19,650
Now we're starting to get the good...

4313
03:29:19,650 --> 03:29:20,910
We're getting our stuff back everybody.

4314
03:29:21,650 --> 03:29:22,670
Minor setback.

4315
03:29:22,750 --> 03:29:23,550
Minor setback.

4316
03:29:23,810 --> 03:29:25,210
But we're getting everything back.

4317
03:29:25,850 --> 03:29:27,210
Nothing is spawned yet.

4318
03:29:27,530 --> 03:29:28,910
Do you think I need to go further away?

4319
03:29:30,030 --> 03:29:30,510
Here.

4320
03:29:30,630 --> 03:29:32,570
Actually I'm going to build out a little over there.

4321
03:29:38,050 --> 03:29:38,530
Okay.

4322
03:29:38,570 --> 03:29:39,150
Like this?

4323
03:29:41,910 --> 03:29:43,370
Give them a little bit more.

4324
03:29:44,390 --> 03:29:47,230
Mean comment to balance out all the nice comments.

4325
03:29:49,770 --> 03:29:51,310
Well, what's the mean... what you're saying?

4326
03:29:53,670 --> 03:29:54,630
Mint, you...

4327
03:29:56,290 --> 03:29:56,770
You...

4328
03:29:58,270 --> 03:29:59,750
You have a crooked tooth.

4329
03:30:00,510 --> 03:30:03,570
You have a crooked tooth.

4330
03:30:03,570 --> 03:30:04,390
You have a fang.

4331
03:30:07,250 --> 03:30:09,350
I... I...

4332
03:30:09,350 --> 03:30:10,650
You see it?

4333
03:30:11,990 --> 03:30:12,770
I...

4334
03:30:12,770 --> 03:30:13,430
I...

4335
03:30:13,430 --> 03:30:16,850
You see it?

4336
03:30:17,710 --> 03:30:18,490
I...

4337
03:30:19,570 --> 03:30:21,530
Crab's tooth.

4338
03:30:25,170 --> 03:30:26,570
I...

4339
03:30:26,570 --> 03:30:28,510
I have

4340
03:30:34,580 --> 03:30:35,880
one fang.

4341
03:30:37,620 --> 03:30:38,320
I...

4342
03:30:38,320 --> 03:30:39,040
I...

4343
03:30:39,960 --> 03:30:40,960
You see it?

4344
03:30:41,880 --> 03:30:42,860
You see it?

4345
03:30:44,040 --> 03:30:45,000
You see it?

4346
03:30:46,400 --> 03:30:48,140
You see it?

4347
03:30:57,810 --> 03:30:59,310
One block of mintcraft.

4348
03:31:01,350 --> 03:31:03,290
Did anyone make that joke yet?

4349
03:31:03,590 --> 03:31:05,170
Glad you made up a safe window.

4350
03:31:05,370 --> 03:31:06,010
Thanks road.

4351
03:31:06,270 --> 03:31:07,290
Cute fang.

4352
03:31:07,410 --> 03:31:08,230
Thank you.

4353
03:31:12,890 --> 03:31:14,730
I love deformed teeth.

4354
03:31:15,830 --> 03:31:16,890
I love deformed teeth.

4355
03:31:16,890 --> 03:31:18,050
I love teeth that are messed up.

4356
03:31:18,050 --> 03:31:19,370
It's my favorite thing.

4357
03:31:24,070 --> 03:31:25,810
You're too close to save me.

4358
03:31:26,930 --> 03:31:27,570
Sorry.

4359
03:31:35,230 --> 03:31:37,230
Barry finally messaged me back.

4360
03:31:40,690 --> 03:31:43,070
I don't know if I can say it though.

4361
03:31:44,390 --> 03:31:45,350
I'm lagging a little.

4362
03:31:45,750 --> 03:31:47,330
I don't think I can say it.

4363
03:31:49,750 --> 03:31:51,050
The special thing.

4364
03:31:51,390 --> 03:31:52,530
She was like...

4365
03:31:52,690 --> 03:31:54,270
I was like, what's the special thing I did?

4366
03:31:54,370 --> 03:31:55,790
She's like, did I say something like that?

4367
03:31:55,970 --> 03:31:56,810
You were cute.

4368
03:32:03,410 --> 03:32:04,330
There's something else.

4369
03:32:04,350 --> 03:32:05,190
But I can't say it.

4370
03:32:07,030 --> 03:32:08,390
What happened to the right fang?

4371
03:32:09,650 --> 03:32:11,150
I never had two fangs.

4372
03:32:11,630 --> 03:32:13,410
I always just had one fang.

4373
03:32:13,510 --> 03:32:13,850
I always just had one fang.

4374
03:32:13,850 --> 03:32:15,570
Because my teeth grew weird.

4375
03:32:17,090 --> 03:32:18,470
And I died weird.

4376
03:32:21,670 --> 03:32:22,550
And I died weird.

4377
03:32:28,510 --> 03:32:30,190
Guys, I love my one tooth.

4378
03:32:31,670 --> 03:32:33,850
I love my one messed up tooth.

4379
03:32:34,690 --> 03:32:35,990
Why are you weird?

4380
03:32:36,050 --> 03:32:37,070
Wow, weirdo.

4381
03:32:38,390 --> 03:32:39,710
Takes one to know one.

4382
03:32:44,120 --> 03:32:45,960
That sounds like a self report.

4383
03:32:48,800 --> 03:32:50,200
The tooth is real.

4384
03:32:50,580 --> 03:32:52,400
Oh, Minecraft music.

4385
03:32:58,390 --> 03:32:59,170
Snaggle tooth.

4386
03:33:01,530 --> 03:33:02,250
Snaggle tooth.

4387
03:33:07,500 --> 03:33:08,580
Got them.

4388
03:33:09,060 --> 03:33:09,780
Absolutely.

4389
03:33:10,400 --> 03:33:12,100
You guys, when do they start?

4390
03:33:13,640 --> 03:33:14,660
Little cow.

4391
03:33:15,060 --> 03:33:16,740
Cow, cow, cow.

4392
03:33:17,580 --> 03:33:19,000
Where are you?

4393
03:33:19,260 --> 03:33:20,840
You, you, you.

4394
03:33:21,780 --> 03:33:23,220
Little cow.

4395
03:33:23,620 --> 03:33:25,760
Cow, cow, cow.

4396
03:33:26,880 --> 03:33:31,720
Why won't you come home?

4397
03:33:32,080 --> 03:33:32,980
Home, home.

4398
03:33:33,260 --> 03:33:34,700
It's still not grass?

4399
03:33:37,820 --> 03:33:39,180
It needs to be grass.

4400
03:33:40,400 --> 03:33:41,480
Can't just be dirt.

4401
03:33:45,540 --> 03:33:47,940
If I do this, will it happen faster?

4402
03:33:49,440 --> 03:33:51,460
Ms. Mint Phantom, what's the pink thing?

4403
03:33:58,960 --> 03:34:00,920
Oh, I can't use it.

4404
03:34:02,280 --> 03:34:03,180
Check the bio.

4405
03:34:04,060 --> 03:34:05,840
We're in the plains, baby.

4406
03:34:14,950 --> 03:34:16,710
I got a pink thing.

4407
03:34:19,930 --> 03:34:22,550
Umm... while I at MGS con.

4408
03:34:22,850 --> 03:34:24,570
But not at MGS con.

4409
03:34:24,850 --> 03:34:25,230
But not at MGS con.

4410
03:34:25,230 --> 03:34:26,610
Just while I was there, you know?

4411
03:34:28,290 --> 03:34:29,310
I can spawn?

4412
03:34:29,630 --> 03:34:29,870
Okay.

4413
03:34:30,010 --> 03:34:30,930
It's gonna spawn.

4414
03:34:31,590 --> 03:34:33,010
Guys, just hold...

4415
03:34:33,010 --> 03:34:35,390
I won't end stream until we get a cow.

4416
03:34:38,030 --> 03:34:39,370
Where is the cow?

4417
03:34:39,570 --> 03:34:40,130
Oh!

4418
03:34:41,070 --> 03:34:42,030
Step 7.

4419
03:34:42,970 --> 03:34:43,570
2500.

4420
03:34:44,550 --> 03:34:46,070
What do we get now?

4421
03:34:46,070 --> 03:34:46,250
Wow.

4422
03:34:47,030 --> 03:34:48,150
Where's the diamonds?

4423
03:34:51,570 --> 03:34:53,030
Why don't we get any diamonds?

4424
03:34:53,430 --> 03:34:55,630
We're getting deep sleep with no diamonds yet.

4425
03:34:58,950 --> 03:34:59,470
Emeralds.

4426
03:34:59,470 --> 03:34:59,990
Nice.

4427
03:35:05,180 --> 03:35:07,660
Was the pink thing one more brain cell for chat?

4428
03:35:08,660 --> 03:35:10,120
I need it more than you.

4429
03:35:11,580 --> 03:35:12,800
What can we buy?

4430
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:15,840
Really enjoyed hearing your MGS CON stories.

4431
03:35:16,220 --> 03:35:18,420
So happy your brain round is thriving more than ever!

4432
03:35:18,600 --> 03:35:18,840
Yeah!

4433
03:35:19,660 --> 03:35:22,620
Glad you were able to get home alright and good luck with the upcoming CON.

4434
03:35:22,700 --> 03:35:24,400
Thank you Ms. Consanity!

4435
03:35:25,960 --> 03:35:26,880
Thank you so much...

4436
03:35:26,880 --> 03:35:27,740
String!

4437
03:35:29,480 --> 03:35:31,940
What were we trying to get string again for?

4438
03:35:32,440 --> 03:35:33,640
What were we trying to make?

4439
03:35:33,900 --> 03:35:35,780
We needed 12 string to make something.

4440
03:35:37,320 --> 03:35:38,160
What was it?

4441
03:35:39,240 --> 03:35:40,180
Oh a bed!

4442
03:35:43,080 --> 03:35:43,720
Huh.

4443
03:35:48,300 --> 03:35:50,520
I don't have so much iron though.

4444
03:35:50,900 --> 03:35:52,220
Should I waste it?

4445
03:35:52,920 --> 03:35:53,800
You think?

4446
03:35:56,400 --> 03:35:57,960
You think I should waste it?

4447
03:36:04,660 --> 03:36:06,660
We don't technically...

4448
03:36:07,180 --> 03:36:07,500
Diamond!

4449
03:36:08,540 --> 03:36:09,720
Oh my god!

4450
03:36:11,220 --> 03:36:12,400
Wait what do you sell?

4451
03:36:13,240 --> 03:36:14,020
What do you buy?

4452
03:36:15,320 --> 03:36:15,920
Single diamond!

4453
03:36:16,420 --> 03:36:17,060
Yeah!

4454
03:36:19,140 --> 03:36:20,340
Keep growing!

4455
03:36:20,480 --> 03:36:21,020
Keep growing!

4456
03:36:21,120 --> 03:36:21,600
Keep growing!

4457
03:36:28,520 --> 03:36:32,400
I'm gonna... I'm gonna make more room for activities.

4458
03:36:35,860 --> 03:36:37,580
Where's my hole?

4459
03:36:39,480 --> 03:36:40,380
Where's my hole?

4460
03:36:41,680 --> 03:36:43,040
Where's my hole?

4461
03:36:43,280 --> 03:36:43,680
Hole?

4462
03:36:43,800 --> 03:36:44,180
Hole?

4463
03:36:44,240 --> 03:36:44,660
Hole?

4464
03:36:44,860 --> 03:36:45,080
Here.

4465
03:36:45,200 --> 03:36:46,400
I'll just make a wooden one.

4466
03:36:46,960 --> 03:36:49,040
Your Metal Gear brain rot is contagious.

4467
03:36:49,860 --> 03:36:51,040
I know it is.

4468
03:36:52,600 --> 03:36:54,240
I know it is.

4469
03:36:56,080 --> 03:36:56,800
Oh wait.

4470
03:36:59,100 --> 03:37:00,080
How do I...

4471
03:37:00,080 --> 03:37:01,620
How do I get more seeds?

4472
03:37:05,100 --> 03:37:07,540
Mint's life depends on finding a floating cow.

4473
03:37:07,840 --> 03:37:09,820
The stakes have never been higher.

4474
03:37:19,840 --> 03:37:21,300
How do I make more seeds?

4475
03:37:21,300 --> 03:37:22,620
Oh the crafting.

4476
03:37:22,680 --> 03:37:23,480
You use the slices.

4477
03:37:23,640 --> 03:37:23,800
Okay.

4478
03:37:24,160 --> 03:37:25,280
Let's let this grow.

4479
03:37:26,180 --> 03:37:27,280
Let's let that grow.

4480
03:37:27,620 --> 03:37:28,500
And then...

4481
03:37:28,500 --> 03:37:29,040
Okay.

4482
03:37:30,280 --> 03:37:30,820
Okay.

4483
03:37:30,840 --> 03:37:31,680
I only have...

4484
03:37:31,680 --> 03:37:33,560
This is as much iron as I have.

4485
03:37:35,080 --> 03:37:36,540
Thank you for your business.

4486
03:37:42,700 --> 03:37:43,420
Let's see.

4487
03:37:45,020 --> 03:37:45,560
Bed.

4488
03:37:47,640 --> 03:37:48,180
Oh.

4489
03:37:52,550 --> 03:37:53,090
Whoa.

4490
03:37:56,430 --> 03:37:56,790
One.

4491
03:37:57,370 --> 03:37:57,830
Two.

4492
03:37:58,830 --> 03:38:00,150
You guys, we don't have enough!

4493
03:38:03,780 --> 03:38:04,240
Wait.

4494
03:38:05,580 --> 03:38:06,040
Bed.

4495
03:38:10,210 --> 03:38:11,190
There's some in the chest.

4496
03:38:11,570 --> 03:38:12,110
There is...

4497
03:38:12,110 --> 03:38:12,750
Oh, you're right.

4498
03:38:12,790 --> 03:38:13,170
Thank you.

4499
03:38:13,390 --> 03:38:13,850
Two.

4500
03:38:15,050 --> 03:38:16,650
One out of eleven diamonds to go.

4501
03:38:16,770 --> 03:38:18,050
Also, ten out of a thousand.

4502
03:38:18,470 --> 03:38:19,170
A thou...

4503
03:38:19,170 --> 03:38:20,230
Out of a thousand, what?

4504
03:38:22,010 --> 03:38:22,470
Gerson.

4505
03:38:23,050 --> 03:38:24,010
Welcome to my bookshop.

4506
03:38:24,010 --> 03:38:24,530
Thank you.

4507
03:38:24,810 --> 03:38:25,270
Bed.

4508
03:38:26,950 --> 03:38:27,410
Wait.

4509
03:38:28,110 --> 03:38:28,550
Wait.

4510
03:38:28,710 --> 03:38:28,790
Wait.

4511
03:38:30,950 --> 03:38:31,390
Oh!

4512
03:38:31,570 --> 03:38:31,870
Oh!

4513
03:38:31,890 --> 03:38:32,230
Whoa!

4514
03:38:32,350 --> 03:38:32,730
Whoa!

4515
03:38:32,890 --> 03:38:33,050
Whoa!

4516
03:38:33,230 --> 03:38:33,450
Whoa!

4517
03:38:34,390 --> 03:38:34,830
Whoa!

4518
03:38:37,090 --> 03:38:37,530
Bed.

4519
03:38:37,850 --> 03:38:37,990
Bed.

4520
03:38:38,050 --> 03:38:38,130
Bed.

4521
03:38:38,210 --> 03:38:40,290
The Paris Olympics is starting this Friday.

4522
03:38:42,210 --> 03:38:42,870
It is?

4523
03:38:46,170 --> 03:38:46,850
Good night.

4524
03:38:53,640 --> 03:38:55,780
I don't know the last time I watched the Olympics.

4525
03:38:58,880 --> 03:39:01,000
I kind of want to watch them go swimming though.

4526
03:39:01,140 --> 03:39:02,140
In that nasty river.

4527
03:39:03,200 --> 03:39:04,820
I don't want to watch it happen.

4528
03:39:05,180 --> 03:39:09,380
And be like, eww, I can't believe they're doing this, for real.

4529
03:39:12,380 --> 03:39:14,960
They approve the eSports Olympics?

4530
03:39:22,890 --> 03:39:24,770
What's the eSports Olympics?

4531
03:39:32,330 --> 03:39:34,170
They should compete in Metal Gear.

4532
03:39:34,830 --> 03:39:39,490
No, there are people that are actually insane with Metal Gear.

4533
03:39:40,790 --> 03:39:42,330
I know one of the guys.

4534
03:39:42,370 --> 03:39:43,210
His name is Apache.

4535
03:39:43,890 --> 03:39:47,490
And he can literally play the game blindfolded.

4536
03:39:47,830 --> 03:39:50,630
He can beat Metal Gear Solid 3 blindfolded.

4537
03:39:50,670 --> 03:39:52,110
I don't know how people can do that.

4538
03:39:52,810 --> 03:39:56,490
At MGSCon, he did a run where it was all invisible enemies.

4539
03:39:57,630 --> 03:39:59,530
And he was still able to know where they were.

4540
03:40:00,030 --> 03:40:02,970
Their entire life, training to swim in poopy water.

4541
03:40:13,050 --> 03:40:14,630
I saw that, it was crazy.

4542
03:40:14,890 --> 03:40:15,850
It was so crazy.

4543
03:40:17,350 --> 03:40:18,850
How is that possible?

4544
03:40:20,650 --> 03:40:22,890
How do you know where they walk?

4545
03:40:23,230 --> 03:40:24,390
It was so crazy.

4546
03:40:26,510 --> 03:40:29,470
The fact that you can do a blindfolded 2 is just...

4547
03:40:29,470 --> 03:40:32,230
The whole thing blows my mind.

4548
03:40:33,690 --> 03:40:34,830
Speedrunners are so cool.

4549
03:40:35,630 --> 03:40:36,690
Get out of here!

4550
03:40:36,990 --> 03:40:39,370
Go, go, go, go, go, Nasty, go.

4551
03:40:40,750 --> 03:40:43,010
I have got what I wanted from you.

4552
03:40:43,070 --> 03:40:44,050
I need nothing else.

4553
03:40:44,890 --> 03:40:45,990
I need no more from you.

4554
03:40:46,130 --> 03:40:46,610
Diamond!

4555
03:40:50,370 --> 03:40:52,550
2024 Olympic gold medal for bloons.

4556
03:40:52,870 --> 03:40:53,350
Minto.

4557
03:40:55,630 --> 03:40:58,870
I want to play bloons because I want to play the maps.

4558
03:40:59,210 --> 03:41:01,890
I saw some people created the Minto map, so...

4559
03:41:04,110 --> 03:41:05,230
Minto, my Oshii.

4560
03:41:05,390 --> 03:41:08,370
Bogey here, back home after being stranded for a while.

4561
03:41:09,110 --> 03:41:09,590
No!

4562
03:41:09,830 --> 03:41:13,450
Got a new job, getting ready for my courses and still watching my Oshii.

4563
03:41:13,650 --> 03:41:14,810
Thank you for sticking around.

4564
03:41:14,810 --> 03:41:15,890
The silliest coolest ghost.

4565
03:41:15,990 --> 03:41:17,870
Thank you for sticking around too!

4566
03:41:18,950 --> 03:41:22,630
Good luck with your not being stranded anymore and...

4567
03:41:22,630 --> 03:41:23,530
More diamond.

4568
03:41:28,510 --> 03:41:30,610
This much diamond has never happened to me before.

4569
03:41:36,030 --> 03:41:37,410
I watched games done quick.

4570
03:41:37,570 --> 03:41:38,750
That's my Olympics.

4571
03:41:39,910 --> 03:41:41,350
The gaming Olympics.

4572
03:41:46,760 --> 03:41:48,340
I love gaming Olympics.

4573
03:41:51,640 --> 03:41:56,460
Who is that MGS streamer player that would do MGS3 runs in the monkey mask with the torch?

4574
03:41:59,220 --> 03:42:00,100
I don't know.

4575
03:42:00,840 --> 03:42:01,820
Does anybody know?

4576
03:42:06,130 --> 03:42:07,430
Doki is not here to steal.

4577
03:42:08,650 --> 03:42:09,950
Why would she even?

4578
03:42:10,470 --> 03:42:11,410
I asked her...

4579
03:42:11,410 --> 03:42:12,470
I asked her for...

4580
03:42:12,470 --> 03:42:13,690
I was like, can I get on your server?

4581
03:42:16,450 --> 03:42:18,590
I was like, I want to play on your server, Doki.

4582
03:42:19,410 --> 03:42:22,210
So maybe one day you'll randomly see me if you play on there.

4583
03:42:24,050 --> 03:42:26,310
And I'd still like to make my own.

4584
03:42:26,770 --> 03:42:29,130
I haven't given up that idea.

4585
03:42:30,110 --> 03:42:31,030
I just...

4586
03:42:31,610 --> 03:42:32,450
I think...

4587
03:42:32,450 --> 03:42:39,550
I think for a lot of things I might wait until after the Patreon is over because that takes up currently so much of my mental bandwidth.

4588
03:42:41,710 --> 03:42:42,190
So...

4589
03:42:43,530 --> 03:42:45,170
But eventually in the future.

4590
03:42:48,030 --> 03:42:48,750
Having it.

4591
03:42:54,510 --> 03:42:56,950
That server is a war and a half.

4592
03:42:57,150 --> 03:42:57,670
Wait, why?

4593
03:42:58,070 --> 03:42:59,750
What's going on in there?

4594
03:42:59,930 --> 03:43:01,650
All I saw was like some...

4595
03:43:01,650 --> 03:43:03,030
She sent me...

4596
03:43:03,030 --> 03:43:05,830
Like it showed up in my timeline too but Doki was just like...

4597
03:43:05,830 --> 03:43:08,130
Apparently we got married on the server.

4598
03:43:15,100 --> 03:43:17,260
Property value skyrocketing?

4599
03:43:17,260 --> 03:43:19,540
Well, I get exclusive property.

4600
03:43:21,220 --> 03:43:22,780
I get an exclusive space.

4601
03:43:22,780 --> 03:43:23,280
But...

4602
03:43:27,040 --> 03:43:27,560
Zaito!

4603
03:43:27,760 --> 03:43:28,320
Thank you for the...

4604
03:43:28,320 --> 03:43:29,680
50 gifted!

4605
03:43:29,760 --> 03:43:30,660
Thank you so much!

4606
03:43:31,800 --> 03:43:33,240
It was a beautiful wedding.

4607
03:43:33,440 --> 03:43:37,540
Why wasn't I invited to my own wedding that apparently happened?

4608
03:43:39,200 --> 03:43:41,000
How many people went to this wedding?

4609
03:43:43,140 --> 03:43:44,700
What were my vows even?

4610
03:43:49,520 --> 03:43:50,880
You were there kind of.

4611
03:43:51,680 --> 03:43:52,480
She knows.

4612
03:43:52,820 --> 03:43:54,320
Doki is the one who sent it.

4613
03:43:54,320 --> 03:43:54,660
She sent it to me.

4614
03:43:57,560 --> 03:43:58,820
Doki was just like...

4615
03:43:58,820 --> 03:43:59,260
Look at this.

4616
03:44:00,420 --> 03:44:01,220
I was like...

4617
03:44:01,220 --> 03:44:02,540
What's going on in your server?

4618
03:44:10,040 --> 03:44:10,520
Okay.

4619
03:44:10,620 --> 03:44:11,080
Let's see.

4620
03:44:11,620 --> 03:44:12,420
Oh my gosh.

4621
03:44:12,500 --> 03:44:14,800
The grass is taking so long to spread.

4622
03:44:18,980 --> 03:44:20,480
The gooners gooning.

4623
03:44:22,560 --> 03:44:24,260
I recently became a big fan.

4624
03:44:24,560 --> 03:44:25,280
Thank you!

4625
03:44:26,640 --> 03:44:28,380
Your videos help after a long day of work.

4626
03:44:28,460 --> 03:44:28,700
Thank you.

4627
03:44:28,720 --> 03:44:29,520
I can't wait for more content.

4628
03:44:29,640 --> 03:44:29,900
Logan!

4629
03:44:29,980 --> 03:44:30,720
Thank you so much!

4630
03:44:30,940 --> 03:44:31,580
Thank you!

4631
03:44:31,780 --> 03:44:33,160
There's like 70 people.

4632
03:44:35,360 --> 03:44:36,580
Thank you for the raid!

4633
03:44:37,620 --> 03:44:38,520
Thank you so much!

4634
03:44:38,860 --> 03:44:39,980
I hope you had a good stream.

4635
03:44:42,360 --> 03:44:43,360
I just realized.

4636
03:44:43,620 --> 03:44:45,020
I gotta put some stuff away.

4637
03:44:45,400 --> 03:44:46,080
We don't want...

4638
03:44:46,080 --> 03:44:46,320
Wow!

4639
03:44:46,400 --> 03:44:47,620
I have so much lapis.

4640
03:44:48,880 --> 03:44:50,220
We don't want another incident.

4641
03:44:53,180 --> 03:44:53,540
Murphy!

4642
03:44:53,580 --> 03:44:54,340
Thanks for the five gifted!

4643
03:44:54,760 --> 03:44:55,260
I was like...

4644
03:44:55,260 --> 03:44:57,940
It's the cult leader on the Doki SMP.

4645
03:45:01,680 --> 03:45:03,100
Doki, thanks for the gifted.

4646
03:45:03,440 --> 03:45:04,220
Thank you.

4647
03:45:08,260 --> 03:45:09,240
Oh Orca.

4648
03:45:12,120 --> 03:45:13,060
Oh Orca.

4649
03:45:14,880 --> 03:45:16,360
I would say never change.

4650
03:45:16,620 --> 03:45:17,300
But also...

4651
03:45:23,920 --> 03:45:25,440
That's what I'll say about that.

4652
03:45:30,130 --> 03:45:31,630
Please change immediately.

4653
03:45:33,390 --> 03:45:33,990
All right.

4654
03:45:33,990 --> 03:45:34,350
Let's see.

4655
03:45:34,390 --> 03:45:35,330
Let's make our seeds.

4656
03:45:37,890 --> 03:45:38,690
We might...

4657
03:45:38,690 --> 03:45:41,130
I wonder if we'll have enough to...

4658
03:45:42,370 --> 03:45:43,170
Enough diamond...

4659
03:45:45,190 --> 03:45:45,590
To...

4660
03:45:46,270 --> 03:45:47,070
Where is the guy?

4661
03:45:47,870 --> 03:45:48,750
To get a cow.

4662
03:45:49,130 --> 03:45:49,870
Where is he?

4663
03:45:49,950 --> 03:45:50,210
Oh!

4664
03:45:50,690 --> 03:45:51,950
What are you doing up there?

4665
03:46:01,440 --> 03:46:02,040
A cow!

4666
03:46:02,360 --> 03:46:02,980
Wait, six.

4667
03:46:03,360 --> 03:46:03,760
Six.

4668
03:46:03,860 --> 03:46:05,020
I think we have six, you guys.

4669
03:46:05,080 --> 03:46:05,760
I think we have six.

4670
03:46:16,150 --> 03:46:16,670
Wait.

4671
03:46:16,930 --> 03:46:17,830
Should we wait?

4672
03:46:17,930 --> 03:46:18,210
Okay.

4673
03:46:18,330 --> 03:46:18,930
You guys.

4674
03:46:19,430 --> 03:46:22,050
We could cheat mode and I can end stream right now.

4675
03:46:23,710 --> 03:46:24,230
Or...

4676
03:46:25,030 --> 03:46:26,630
We can wait for the grass.

4677
03:46:37,080 --> 03:46:37,600
No.

4678
03:46:37,600 --> 03:46:38,500
Stay with us.

4679
03:46:39,860 --> 03:46:40,740
I'll see you tomorrow.

4680
03:46:41,780 --> 03:46:45,500
With all my exciting things that I have and have not.

4681
03:46:45,780 --> 03:46:47,400
I hope we'll see you on Doki's server.

4682
03:46:47,580 --> 03:46:48,280
That'd be really fun.

4683
03:46:48,620 --> 03:46:49,140
Yeah.

4684
03:46:49,260 --> 03:46:49,940
I'll ask you questions.

4685
03:46:49,940 --> 03:46:50,740
I'll ask her again about it.

4686
03:46:53,400 --> 03:46:54,500
Wait for grass.

4687
03:46:57,320 --> 03:46:59,280
I'm kind of tired, though, you guys.

4688
03:47:07,030 --> 03:47:07,550
Okay.

4689
03:47:08,230 --> 03:47:10,070
We'll wait for the grass a little bit longer.

4690
03:47:15,300 --> 03:47:16,040
What's tomorrow?

4691
03:47:16,340 --> 03:47:16,960
My anniversary.

4692
03:47:18,280 --> 03:47:21,160
I'll have been streaming for one whole year.

4693
03:47:22,680 --> 03:47:23,880
As of tomorrow.

4694
03:47:23,880 --> 03:47:24,180
Tomorrow.

4695
03:47:24,640 --> 03:47:27,760
I finally get to celebrate my one-year anniversary.

4696
03:47:31,600 --> 03:47:35,800
I never got to celebrate it before I left all those years ago.

4697
03:47:38,860 --> 03:47:40,300
One whole year.

4698
03:47:41,760 --> 03:47:43,020
Never got to celebrate it.

4699
03:47:44,660 --> 03:47:46,360
So, you know...

4700
03:47:47,120 --> 03:47:48,300
Better late than never.

4701
03:47:48,620 --> 03:47:49,260
Maybe.

4702
03:47:52,460 --> 03:47:55,840
Because I came back on the same day that I graduated.

4703
03:47:57,860 --> 03:47:58,380
Right?

4704
03:47:59,580 --> 03:48:00,620
And now...

4705
03:48:00,620 --> 03:48:03,440
So it's just like I picked up when I left off.

4706
03:48:03,680 --> 03:48:04,340
Kind of.

4707
03:48:05,640 --> 03:48:06,680
12 months total.

4708
03:48:06,860 --> 03:48:07,660
Non-consecutive.

4709
03:48:08,180 --> 03:48:09,260
Yeah, pretty much.

4710
03:48:10,900 --> 03:48:12,180
Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

4711
03:48:15,020 --> 03:48:16,220
Glad we can now.

4712
03:48:16,440 --> 03:48:17,360
Yeah, I know, right?

4713
03:48:18,720 --> 03:48:19,240
I'm glad we can now.

4714
03:48:19,260 --> 03:48:19,600
I do.

4715
03:48:19,700 --> 03:48:20,040
I do.

4716
03:48:20,120 --> 03:48:21,000
I'll make sure.

4717
03:48:21,060 --> 03:48:21,980
I'll try to make it fun.

4718
03:48:22,620 --> 03:48:24,100
Even though, like I said...

4719
03:48:24,660 --> 03:48:25,000
Sorry.

4720
03:48:25,440 --> 03:48:28,340
I wish I could offer you guys more.

4721
03:48:29,840 --> 03:48:31,500
I wish anything was ready.

4722
03:48:32,020 --> 03:48:33,580
I wish... I wish...

4723
03:48:33,580 --> 03:48:36,020
I wasn't so slow and bad at stuff.

4724
03:48:36,360 --> 03:48:37,400
So I'm really sorry.

4725
03:48:37,540 --> 03:48:38,100
I feel...

4726
03:48:39,060 --> 03:48:39,540
Quite...

4727
03:48:40,980 --> 03:48:42,060
Guilty about it.

4728
03:48:42,540 --> 03:48:44,480
I probably shouldn't have gone to the convention.

4729
03:48:44,520 --> 03:48:45,360
I should have...

4730
03:48:46,180 --> 03:48:48,300
I should have taken the time to...

4731
03:48:49,820 --> 03:48:51,180
To get everything ready.

4732
03:48:51,540 --> 03:48:52,200
And stuff.

4733
03:48:55,660 --> 03:48:56,660
Ooh, more sand.

4734
03:48:56,780 --> 03:48:58,360
Wait, did I lose my sand before?

4735
03:48:58,860 --> 03:49:00,020
No, I still have the sand.

4736
03:49:00,800 --> 03:49:01,660
Wait, where did he go?

4737
03:49:02,060 --> 03:49:03,180
Oh, what the hell?

4738
03:49:03,260 --> 03:49:04,580
Get out of my bed, you freak!

4739
03:49:05,920 --> 03:49:08,380
Why are traitors laying in my bed?

4740
03:49:10,500 --> 03:49:11,600
Get out of my bed!

4741
03:49:11,880 --> 03:49:12,460
It's me.

4742
03:49:15,700 --> 03:49:16,420
Don't apologize.

4743
03:49:16,560 --> 03:49:17,440
I'm so keen.

4744
03:49:17,580 --> 03:49:18,680
What do you mean by that?

4745
03:49:19,620 --> 03:49:21,000
You had fun at the con.

4746
03:49:21,080 --> 03:49:22,380
It was worth it.

4747
03:49:22,940 --> 03:49:24,360
Anti-negative thoughts beam.

4748
03:49:28,620 --> 03:49:30,000
Get out of my bed!

4749
03:49:31,940 --> 03:49:32,380
Wait!

4750
03:49:32,560 --> 03:49:33,220
Oh my gosh!

4751
03:49:33,340 --> 03:49:33,560
Wait!

4752
03:49:33,680 --> 03:49:34,820
We lost the cow!

4753
03:49:35,800 --> 03:49:40,340
All we want for you to do at your anniversary is hang out with you and watch you sing funny ghost songs.

4754
03:49:41,360 --> 03:49:44,540
Well, all my VODs are like... privated, right?

4755
03:49:44,600 --> 03:49:45,620
My old VODs.

4756
03:49:46,860 --> 03:49:48,820
So if you haven't seen those before...

4757
03:49:49,830 --> 03:49:50,200
Um...

4758
03:49:52,240 --> 03:49:54,100
Be prepared, I guess.

4759
03:49:55,820 --> 03:49:57,040
Be prepared!

4760
03:49:57,640 --> 03:49:58,880
It's gonna be bad.

4761
03:50:03,110 --> 03:50:04,880
You're gonna see baby Minto...

4762
03:50:05,570 --> 03:50:06,660
Long, long ago.

4763
03:50:13,670 --> 03:50:17,890
If most of my friends weren't all taken up by NSFW...

4764
03:50:18,530 --> 03:50:18,810
Come

4765
03:50:24,020 --> 03:50:24,400
on.

4766
03:50:34,120 --> 03:50:36,360
Sometimes you guys just, uh...

4767
03:50:39,200 --> 03:50:41,100
Chat says the darndest things.

4768
03:50:47,500 --> 03:50:51,540
From the MC Wedding Cameraman, it's an honor to know you heard about it.

4769
03:50:51,560 --> 03:50:52,020
I kneel.

4770
03:50:53,200 --> 03:50:54,580
I saw it on Twitter.

4771
03:50:55,280 --> 03:50:56,440
I did see it.

4772
03:50:59,860 --> 03:51:05,820
Um... I'd send an akasuba to tell you how proud I am to watch you doing all these conventions and being the best that you can be.

4773
03:51:05,880 --> 03:51:06,440
Keep it up.

4774
03:51:07,580 --> 03:51:11,780
You guys have... I mean, your name is literally a kinky cadaver.

4775
03:51:12,660 --> 03:51:16,580
Like, you but... Seriously, I think we need to bring shame back a little bit.

4776
03:51:19,120 --> 03:51:22,520
I think we need a little bit more shame in our lives.

4777
03:51:28,500 --> 03:51:29,040
Let's see.

4778
03:51:29,140 --> 03:51:30,000
Let's cook this.

4779
03:51:31,060 --> 03:51:33,220
And let's make a new pickaxe.

4780
03:51:36,790 --> 03:51:40,250
It's barely... It's growing at a snail's pace, you guys.

4781
03:51:41,210 --> 03:51:42,550
Absolute snail's pace.

4782
03:51:43,110 --> 03:51:44,390
Shame, shame.

4783
03:51:45,190 --> 03:51:47,430
So says Freak Phantom.

4784
03:51:52,220 --> 03:51:54,300
King Shaming is my king... king?

4785
03:51:56,000 --> 03:51:56,940
Lulu-kachu!

4786
03:51:57,200 --> 03:51:57,840
Welcome to membership.

4787
03:51:58,200 --> 03:52:00,980
We appreciate all that you do, mint combo ghostie.

4788
03:52:01,440 --> 03:52:02,260
Thank you!

4789
03:52:04,560 --> 03:52:06,020
Thank you so much.

4790
03:52:06,480 --> 03:52:08,680
That was the flower girl.

4791
03:52:09,240 --> 03:52:11,100
There's a flower girl!

4792
03:52:25,230 --> 03:52:27,850
Yeah, let's try widening it a little bit.

4793
03:52:29,270 --> 03:52:30,310
Let's plump her up.

4794
03:52:32,670 --> 03:52:34,430
Oh look, it's spreading more.

4795
03:52:38,850 --> 03:52:40,210
Alright, more.

4796
03:52:40,650 --> 03:52:41,750
More grass!

4797
03:52:42,170 --> 03:52:42,750
More grass!

4798
03:52:43,710 --> 03:52:44,590
More grass!

4799
03:52:44,910 --> 03:52:45,490
More grass!

4800
03:52:45,490 --> 03:52:47,190
More grass!

4801
03:52:47,610 --> 03:52:48,010
More grass!

4802
03:52:48,230 --> 03:52:48,650
More grass!

4803
03:52:50,250 --> 03:52:51,570
More grass.

4804
03:52:52,270 --> 03:52:53,770
Does it grow at night?

4805
03:52:54,610 --> 03:52:56,050
Grass grows at night.

4806
03:53:02,190 --> 03:53:03,530
Touching grass is...

4807
03:53:03,530 --> 03:53:04,110
Okay.

4808
03:53:04,830 --> 03:53:05,590
Question.

4809
03:53:06,830 --> 03:53:09,330
If someone touches grass...

4810
03:53:10,650 --> 03:53:13,050
Would you consider that normie behavior?

4811
03:53:15,570 --> 03:53:17,190
Even if it's like...

4812
03:53:17,190 --> 03:53:19,490
Even if it's like...

4813
03:53:21,490 --> 03:53:22,150
Yes.

4814
03:53:22,470 --> 03:53:23,030
Right?

4815
03:53:23,390 --> 03:53:25,210
Like if someone has a hobby...

4816
03:53:25,210 --> 03:53:28,490
And it involves touching grass, I believe that's normie behavior.

4817
03:53:32,730 --> 03:53:33,390
Moo.

4818
03:53:36,690 --> 03:53:37,670
Not really.

4819
03:53:37,990 --> 03:53:38,670
What do you mean?

4820
03:53:39,750 --> 03:53:41,250
Do they do it voluntarily?

4821
03:53:41,610 --> 03:53:41,790
Yeah.

4822
03:53:43,310 --> 03:53:45,490
Also a library of fanfics.

4823
03:53:46,330 --> 03:53:47,510
I want to write one.

4824
03:53:49,070 --> 03:53:50,070
Oh my god, Tuesday!

4825
03:53:50,270 --> 03:53:51,530
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

4826
03:53:51,850 --> 03:53:52,950
Thank you so much!

4827
03:53:53,010 --> 03:53:53,450
What the heck?

4828
03:53:55,410 --> 03:53:56,530
Yay, we leveled up!

4829
03:54:03,150 --> 03:54:04,490
Like if someone's...

4830
03:54:05,170 --> 03:54:07,070
Having a life equals normie...

4831
03:54:07,070 --> 03:54:08,210
That's how I feel.

4832
03:54:10,950 --> 03:54:12,590
What if it's like a weirdo hobby?

4833
03:54:15,110 --> 03:54:16,410
What's a weirdo hobby?

4834
03:54:18,190 --> 03:54:19,150
Cause like...

4835
03:54:24,740 --> 03:54:26,000
You can't shame me.

4836
03:54:26,000 --> 03:54:26,620
I have no shame.

4837
03:54:26,820 --> 03:54:28,820
I ship Volgen and Jan Ros.

4838
03:54:33,080 --> 03:54:33,660
Brave.

4839
03:54:33,740 --> 03:54:35,200
You're so brave for admitting that.

4840
03:54:38,120 --> 03:54:38,700
VTubing?

4841
03:54:41,300 --> 03:54:42,740
No, like... Okay.

4842
03:54:44,340 --> 03:54:46,240
Like say your hobby...

4843
03:54:47,080 --> 03:54:49,740
Say your hobby is running, right?

4844
03:54:49,900 --> 03:54:50,560
Like you run.

4845
03:54:51,240 --> 03:54:54,880
But like you care really deeply about like stats and...

4846
03:54:54,880 --> 03:54:57,020
Like the nerdy side of things.

4847
03:54:57,260 --> 03:54:58,280
Does that still...

4848
03:54:58,280 --> 03:55:01,180
But that's still considered a normie hobby, right?

4849
03:55:02,400 --> 03:55:02,920
Taxidermy?

4850
03:55:07,330 --> 03:55:08,870
Poor Mint is too far gone.

4851
03:55:10,570 --> 03:55:12,230
Still normie, just lame.

4852
03:55:15,090 --> 03:55:16,510
Aries, thank you for three months!

4853
03:55:17,650 --> 03:55:18,510
It's athletic.

4854
03:55:18,730 --> 03:55:19,010
Right!

4855
03:55:19,250 --> 03:55:20,730
Fitness equals normie!

4856
03:55:20,850 --> 03:55:21,890
I believe that too.

4857
03:55:24,370 --> 03:55:26,190
Thank you guys for justifying me.

4858
03:55:27,010 --> 03:55:28,830
I feel so justified right now.

4859
03:55:37,270 --> 03:55:41,550
I can't stand hearing these bees and they're not doing anything.

4860
03:55:42,070 --> 03:55:45,090
They're acting like they're so busy in there.

4861
03:55:45,310 --> 03:55:45,850
Like leave!

4862
03:55:46,650 --> 03:55:47,510
Get out!

4863
03:55:55,090 --> 03:55:56,950
Asking the least normie chat.

4864
03:55:59,050 --> 03:55:59,930
I don't know.

4865
03:56:00,010 --> 03:56:01,310
I feel like...

4866
03:56:02,510 --> 03:56:03,770
Sometimes I'm like...

4867
03:56:03,770 --> 03:56:05,210
Why do...

4868
03:56:05,210 --> 03:56:08,090
People that like aren't as deranged as me watch me.

4869
03:56:09,070 --> 03:56:09,870
You know?

4870
03:56:09,950 --> 03:56:11,210
Like I feel like I appear...

4871
03:56:11,210 --> 03:56:12,210
Or rather like...

4872
03:56:13,550 --> 03:56:14,570
You wouldn't...

4873
03:56:14,570 --> 03:56:16,090
You wouldn't understand.

4874
03:56:16,610 --> 03:56:19,050
Unless you're like on the level, right?

4875
03:56:19,430 --> 03:56:20,430
You're fun?

4876
03:56:21,850 --> 03:56:23,410
I like the chaos.

4877
03:56:28,070 --> 03:56:30,870
You just don't get the nuanced weird?

4878
03:56:31,170 --> 03:56:32,110
No, no, no.

4879
03:56:32,950 --> 03:56:34,230
Still nor...

4880
03:56:34,230 --> 03:56:35,690
Athletic is normie.

4881
03:56:40,790 --> 03:56:41,890
One year Annie!

4882
03:56:42,370 --> 03:56:43,350
Oh my god!

4883
03:56:43,530 --> 03:56:45,110
She already owes eight months!

4884
03:56:46,870 --> 03:56:48,470
Sent right now cause can't watch tomorrow.

4885
03:56:48,970 --> 03:56:49,790
Thank you!

4886
03:56:51,810 --> 03:56:52,710
Thanks for...

4887
03:56:52,710 --> 03:56:56,430
Thank you for still being around!

4888
03:56:57,910 --> 03:56:58,990
Dorky and cute.

4889
03:57:00,110 --> 03:57:00,750
Dorky and cute.

4890
03:57:01,550 --> 03:57:04,470
Any hobby is a normie hobby if you're casual enough.

4891
03:57:05,390 --> 03:57:06,290
You think so?

4892
03:57:07,650 --> 03:57:08,290
Sailor Moon!

4893
03:57:08,530 --> 03:57:09,730
Thanks for three months!

4894
03:57:11,610 --> 03:57:12,130
Two!

4895
03:57:12,410 --> 03:57:12,770
Oh!

4896
03:57:13,170 --> 03:57:14,010
Thanks, Sehi!

4897
03:57:14,330 --> 03:57:15,830
You always brighten my day mint.

4898
03:57:16,050 --> 03:57:17,190
Thank you!

4899
03:57:19,710 --> 03:57:22,130
Am I your powerful and passionate otaku?

4900
03:57:22,270 --> 03:57:23,570
I don't have the power to do the same.

4901
03:57:23,850 --> 03:57:24,430
You do!

4902
03:57:24,630 --> 03:57:25,490
What are you talking about?

4903
03:57:27,010 --> 03:57:28,310
Everybody has the power.

4904
03:57:29,470 --> 03:57:29,990
You...

4905
03:57:29,990 --> 03:57:31,030
Have the power.

4906
03:57:32,170 --> 03:57:32,710
Just...

4907
03:57:33,350 --> 03:57:33,890
Just...

4908
03:57:33,890 --> 03:57:34,530
Just...

4909
03:57:34,530 --> 03:57:35,610
Do it!

4910
03:57:37,490 --> 03:57:38,850
Just be into the...

4911
03:57:38,850 --> 03:57:41,490
Just like the things that you like a normal amount.

4912
03:57:42,450 --> 03:57:44,830
Or sometimes an abnormal amount.

4913
03:57:46,210 --> 03:57:46,850
That's all.

4914
03:57:50,110 --> 03:57:51,190
Where is he again?

4915
03:57:51,410 --> 03:57:51,950
Oh my god!

4916
03:57:52,050 --> 03:57:52,490
No way!

4917
03:57:52,650 --> 03:57:54,150
Why does he keep spawning up there?

4918
03:57:54,530 --> 03:57:57,510
I can confidently say that you have made me more deranged over the years.

4919
03:57:58,030 --> 03:57:58,670
Thank you!

4920
03:57:58,670 --> 03:57:59,050
Thank you!

4921
03:58:01,630 --> 03:58:03,070
Just want to celebrate with you.

4922
03:58:03,210 --> 03:58:04,110
Don't beat yourself up.

4923
03:58:04,210 --> 03:58:04,690
Merch, etc.

4924
03:58:04,890 --> 03:58:05,430
are just bonuses.

4925
03:58:05,750 --> 03:58:07,350
What's more important is spending time with Minto.

4926
03:58:10,450 --> 03:58:14,310
Guys, you're gonna make me cry.

4927
03:58:18,090 --> 03:58:19,410
Come here, sweet child.

4928
03:58:19,850 --> 03:58:21,390
What do you have to sell for me?

4929
03:58:22,150 --> 03:58:22,790
A donkey.

4930
03:58:24,330 --> 03:58:25,890
Guys, we can get a cat!

4931
03:58:28,970 --> 03:58:30,050
Bring me a cat.

4932
03:58:36,190 --> 03:58:37,230
Farm villagers.

4933
03:58:38,490 --> 03:58:39,450
Order a mob.

4934
03:58:39,610 --> 03:58:39,910
Nice.

4935
03:58:44,230 --> 03:58:46,370
I just got back from my normie hobby.

4936
03:58:46,450 --> 03:58:49,870
Drinking a liter of beer and guzzling Glizzy and then passing out for two hours.

4937
03:58:51,890 --> 03:58:53,870
Can you moe-moe-cune my meal?

4938
03:58:54,030 --> 03:58:55,110
You already ate it!

4939
03:58:56,390 --> 03:58:58,010
The music is a paid actor.

4940
03:58:59,190 --> 03:59:00,650
You already ate it!

4941
03:59:01,350 --> 03:59:02,650
The magic is gone!

4942
03:59:04,070 --> 03:59:05,350
Yeah, what kind of Glizzy?

4943
03:59:08,590 --> 03:59:09,830
Ten out of ten hobby.

4944
03:59:11,030 --> 03:59:11,970
What a freak.

4945
03:59:12,590 --> 03:59:14,150
Gosh I thought I was a freak.

4946
03:59:15,470 --> 03:59:16,910
Your hobby is Glizzies?

4947
03:59:19,290 --> 03:59:21,610
I think it'd be kinda fun to learn how to do the...

4948
03:59:21,610 --> 03:59:23,270
How to do the uh...

4949
03:59:23,270 --> 03:59:24,310
What's the word?

4950
03:59:25,910 --> 03:59:28,050
You know how like there's hot dog eating contest?

4951
03:59:29,090 --> 03:59:31,510
That was my grandmother's birthday so I made her baked Alaska.

4952
03:59:32,190 --> 03:59:32,630
She's a real hot dog.

4953
03:59:32,630 --> 03:59:33,690
What's a baked Alaska?

4954
03:59:34,850 --> 03:59:37,390
And torched the meringue right in front of her.

4955
03:59:37,470 --> 03:59:39,930
Very normie, but now I get to spend the rest of the night with Mint.

4956
03:59:41,010 --> 03:59:42,030
What about your grandma?

4957
03:59:45,090 --> 03:59:46,410
Don't worry about being too slow.

4958
03:59:46,510 --> 03:59:48,030
We're not providing enough for us.

4959
03:59:48,330 --> 03:59:49,710
Every stream with you is a blast.

4960
03:59:50,190 --> 03:59:52,350
We're glad to be able to hang out with you.

4961
03:59:52,470 --> 03:59:53,110
Mint, love.

4962
03:59:53,590 --> 03:59:54,330
Thank you.

4963
03:59:57,070 --> 03:59:57,930
Grandma's gone to bed.

4964
03:59:59,070 --> 04:00:00,230
Granny's getting scammed.

4965
04:00:04,290 --> 04:00:06,390
Ice cream cake which you torch the top of.

4966
04:00:07,850 --> 04:00:08,950
That sounds awesome.

4967
04:00:10,630 --> 04:00:13,190
Ice cream covered in whipped cream and then baked or torched.

4968
04:00:13,490 --> 04:00:14,310
Look at you guys.

4969
04:00:14,370 --> 04:00:15,050
It's getting closer.

4970
04:00:15,210 --> 04:00:15,570
It's getting closer.

4971
04:00:17,770 --> 04:00:18,170
Soon.

4972
04:00:18,170 --> 04:00:19,010
Soon, soon, soon.

4973
04:00:20,670 --> 04:00:22,150
And we have some...

4974
04:00:24,170 --> 04:00:25,270
melon for food.

4975
04:00:29,130 --> 04:00:32,470
Did you guys ever believe that if you ate the seeds it would grow inside you?

4976
04:00:33,910 --> 04:00:34,870
Like a tree?

4977
04:00:36,050 --> 04:00:37,010
I'll be honest.

4978
04:00:37,130 --> 04:00:38,930
I purposefully ate them.

4979
04:00:45,960 --> 04:00:46,560
Yes.

4980
04:00:49,040 --> 04:00:50,320
No, I was normal.

4981
04:00:50,840 --> 04:00:52,360
Every kid believes that.

4982
04:00:56,180 --> 04:00:57,980
But I think too much seed...

4983
04:00:58,620 --> 04:01:00,640
in an amount is poisonous.

4984
04:01:03,680 --> 04:01:04,940
Or was it a puppet?

4985
04:01:06,520 --> 04:01:07,260
Can't remember.

4986
04:01:08,000 --> 04:01:09,400
That's understandable too.

4987
04:01:09,880 --> 04:01:10,920
Well, how about now?

4988
04:01:11,440 --> 04:01:13,960
If you eat a seed, will it grow inside you?

4989
04:01:14,100 --> 04:01:14,900
I think it might...

4990
04:01:14,900 --> 04:01:16,380
Well, maybe the stomach acids.

4991
04:01:16,460 --> 04:01:17,600
I think it could a little bit though.

4992
04:01:18,100 --> 04:01:19,380
I still believe that.

4993
04:01:19,520 --> 04:01:20,420
That's what I'm saying.

4994
04:01:26,230 --> 04:01:28,990
Just take an antacid and then eat the seed.

4995
04:01:29,410 --> 04:01:30,290
And it'll grow.

4996
04:01:30,990 --> 04:01:31,430
Probably.

4997
04:01:33,510 --> 04:01:34,730
It needs sunlight.

4998
04:01:35,250 --> 04:01:35,690
What?

4999
04:01:35,730 --> 04:01:37,730
But seeds are buried in the ground.

5000
04:01:38,250 --> 04:01:39,610
Why does it need sunlight?

5001
04:01:39,750 --> 04:01:41,150
My tummy is nice and warm.

5002
04:01:43,150 --> 04:01:45,530
They just need a warmth and love.

5003
04:01:46,330 --> 04:01:48,050
To be cared for.

5004
04:01:48,650 --> 04:01:49,870
Take an antacid.

5005
04:01:50,010 --> 04:01:51,410
No acid in your tummy.

5006
04:01:52,250 --> 04:01:52,790
Believe?

5007
04:01:53,070 --> 04:01:53,690
You mean they don't?

5008
04:01:54,650 --> 04:01:56,890
Take like 50 tums.

5009
04:01:58,250 --> 04:01:58,990
Or something.

5010
04:01:59,750 --> 04:02:01,350
Just down the whole bottle.

5011
04:02:01,710 --> 04:02:02,710
Eat the seed.

5012
04:02:03,750 --> 04:02:04,490
Wham bam.

5013
04:02:04,570 --> 04:02:05,230
Thank you ma'am.

5014
04:02:05,290 --> 04:02:06,270
You got yourself a watermelon.

5015
04:02:11,090 --> 04:02:12,590
You're a proud parent.

5016
04:02:13,570 --> 04:02:14,570
Of a watermelon.

5017
04:02:18,050 --> 04:02:19,130
Is that safe?

5018
04:02:21,250 --> 04:02:22,610
Are you gonna take advice?

5019
04:02:22,870 --> 04:02:24,510
Are you gonna take life advice from a ghost?

5020
04:02:26,290 --> 04:02:28,970
Are you gonna take life advice from someone who's dead?

5021
04:02:29,410 --> 04:02:31,610
Who died under mysterious circumstances?

5022
04:02:38,570 --> 04:02:39,130
Yes.

5023
04:02:43,450 --> 04:02:44,730
From a Vtuber?

5024
04:02:45,450 --> 04:02:48,230
Would you listen to any advice from a Vtuber?

5025
04:02:49,610 --> 04:02:51,190
Actually there are some very...

5026
04:02:52,350 --> 04:02:54,190
Smart Vtubers out there.

5027
04:02:54,810 --> 04:03:00,880
I got the most useless mob but I think it's kinda worth.

5028
04:03:01,520 --> 04:03:02,760
Actually it's not useless.

5029
04:03:02,940 --> 04:03:04,140
It's a companionship thing.

5030
04:03:05,260 --> 04:03:06,120
I'm lonely.

5031
04:03:08,300 --> 04:03:09,720
Gotta get both sides.

5032
04:03:12,800 --> 04:03:14,420
She wants us to be ghosts.

5033
04:03:14,940 --> 04:03:16,600
I just said I was lonely.

5034
04:03:19,600 --> 04:03:20,120
Oops.

5035
04:03:20,520 --> 04:03:20,880
Oopsie.

5036
04:03:25,120 --> 04:03:27,400
Thank you for the five gifts.

5037
04:03:27,440 --> 04:03:28,200
Thank you.

5038
04:03:29,400 --> 04:03:31,880
I believe that gum would stick all over my stomach.

5039
04:03:32,020 --> 04:03:35,780
But gum... gum... that actually doesn't digest for like...

5040
04:03:38,940 --> 04:03:39,920
There's our cat.

5041
04:03:41,400 --> 04:03:42,140
Our cat.

5042
04:03:42,340 --> 04:03:43,680
Wait, they don't love us.

5043
04:03:44,500 --> 04:03:45,260
Our cat.

5044
04:03:47,120 --> 04:03:48,540
Could you give a moe moe...

5045
04:03:48,540 --> 04:03:49,000
Hey, whoa, whoa.

5046
04:03:49,020 --> 04:03:50,160
Stay back from the...

5047
04:03:50,160 --> 04:03:52,460
Stay away from the edge of the world, cat.

5048
04:03:53,640 --> 04:03:56,520
Give a moe moe kyun to your multivitamin.

5049
04:03:57,600 --> 04:03:58,500
Oh my gosh.

5050
04:04:03,630 --> 04:04:05,550
You are being healthy.

5051
04:04:10,740 --> 04:04:11,780
Make it delicious.

5052
04:04:14,660 --> 04:04:17,060
Moe moe kyun.

5053
04:04:24,770 --> 04:04:25,330
Lins stones.

5054
04:04:26,170 --> 04:04:27,250
Grand Dad.

5055
04:04:28,810 --> 04:04:29,650
What do you have?

5056
04:04:31,870 --> 04:04:32,770
Amethyst shard.

5057
04:04:41,790 --> 04:04:43,750
We could buy this cow, I think.

5058
04:04:44,450 --> 04:04:45,750
Wait, do I have enough?

5059
04:04:48,490 --> 04:04:50,170
I think we can buy this cow!

5060
04:04:57,730 --> 04:04:58,670
Let's go fishing.

5061
04:05:04,270 --> 04:05:05,130
I need fish.

5062
04:05:05,130 --> 04:05:05,210
Fish.

5063
04:05:07,170 --> 04:05:08,170
Kyuntax.

5064
04:05:10,090 --> 04:05:11,090
Kyuntax.

5065
04:05:12,830 --> 04:05:13,850
Gone fishing.

5066
04:05:16,570 --> 04:05:17,070
Nice.

5067
04:05:32,910 --> 04:05:37,750
Oh, come on.

5068
04:05:39,330 --> 04:05:40,050
Fishy business.

5069
04:05:46,170 --> 04:05:49,310
Please bless this sleep aid supplement as I try...

5070
04:05:50,530 --> 04:05:52,790
and fist fight the sleep paralysis demon.

5071
04:05:54,370 --> 04:05:55,790
Okay, I read that correctly.

5072
04:05:57,830 --> 04:05:59,510
But at first I did not...

5073
04:06:00,310 --> 04:06:01,930
At first I did not...

5074
04:06:04,370 --> 04:06:06,570
At first I did not read that correctly.

5075
04:06:11,950 --> 04:06:13,470
Let me get my cat first.

5076
04:06:13,570 --> 04:06:14,130
Is that okay?

5077
04:06:16,990 --> 04:06:18,470
Oh, what are you doing over there?

5078
04:06:22,690 --> 04:06:24,010
Pss pss pss pss pss pss pss.

5079
04:06:26,630 --> 04:06:27,570
No no no no no.

5080
04:06:27,710 --> 04:06:28,410
I have more.

5081
04:06:28,570 --> 04:06:28,830
I have more.

5082
04:06:33,590 --> 04:06:34,470
Come here, cat.

5083
04:06:34,790 --> 04:06:35,530
Come here, cat.

5084
04:06:36,370 --> 04:06:37,070
Cat, come here.

5085
04:06:37,770 --> 04:06:38,130
Cat.

5086
04:06:38,750 --> 04:06:39,270
Whoa whoa.

5087
04:06:39,410 --> 04:06:39,730
Oh, cat.

5088
04:06:39,970 --> 04:06:40,350
There we go.

5089
04:06:40,410 --> 04:06:41,050
Okay, come here, cat.

5090
04:06:43,470 --> 04:06:44,230
Come here, cat.

5091
04:06:44,390 --> 04:06:45,090
Get in my bed.

5092
04:06:45,430 --> 04:06:46,430
Get in my bed, cat.

5093
04:06:47,030 --> 04:06:47,810
Get in my bed.

5094
04:06:48,830 --> 04:06:49,850
Get in my bed, cat.

5095
04:06:50,210 --> 04:06:50,570
Meow.

5096
04:06:50,790 --> 04:06:51,450
Yeah, yeah.

5097
04:06:51,530 --> 04:06:52,130
Go that way.

5098
04:06:59,750 --> 04:07:00,890
Don't push him off!

5099
04:07:01,030 --> 04:07:01,750
Don't push him off!

5100
04:07:01,810 --> 04:07:02,370
Don't push him off!

5101
04:07:05,590 --> 04:07:07,650
So we could buy a cat.

5102
04:07:07,770 --> 04:07:08,270
Wait, 22?

5103
04:07:09,630 --> 04:07:11,270
I don't know about you!

5104
04:07:16,660 --> 04:07:19,400
We might... Okay, it might be a race at this point.

5105
04:07:20,220 --> 04:07:21,040
Okay, look at this.

5106
04:07:21,180 --> 04:07:22,040
I'm gonna... Okay, watch.

5107
04:07:22,380 --> 04:07:23,460
I'm gonna order it.

5108
04:07:25,580 --> 04:07:35,460
Okay, now it's a race between the grass and the man.

5109
04:07:38,620 --> 04:07:40,300
That's... It's a race.

5110
04:07:40,740 --> 04:07:41,500
It's on.

5111
04:07:42,180 --> 04:07:43,280
It's on, baby.

5112
04:07:43,400 --> 04:07:43,740
It's on.

5113
04:07:44,500 --> 04:07:45,800
Let's put some stuff away.

5114
04:07:47,260 --> 04:07:48,920
Actually, let's get some bone meal.

5115
04:07:52,630 --> 04:07:54,330
Grass versus ass.

5116
04:07:54,470 --> 04:07:55,030
Exactly.

5117
04:07:58,370 --> 04:07:59,470
Oh my god.

5118
04:07:59,490 --> 04:08:00,050
Oh my gosh.

5119
04:08:00,070 --> 04:08:01,850
I just realized it's so late.

5120
04:08:06,450 --> 04:08:08,190
Chill Minecraft evening.

5121
04:08:10,970 --> 04:08:12,690
Do I have any more iron in here?

5122
04:08:13,390 --> 04:08:13,870
Nope.

5123
04:08:15,610 --> 04:08:17,430
I'm starting to feel a little sick, though.

5124
04:08:18,990 --> 04:08:20,330
Like a little woozy.

5125
04:08:22,410 --> 04:08:24,550
That's why I'm gonna wrap it up soonish.

5126
04:08:26,510 --> 04:08:26,990
Meow.

5127
04:08:27,690 --> 04:08:28,170
Meow.

5128
04:08:33,470 --> 04:08:33,910
Meow.

5129
04:08:35,770 --> 04:08:37,090
Go sleep ghostie.

5130
04:08:37,550 --> 04:08:38,130
I will.

5131
04:08:39,210 --> 04:08:39,650
Meow.

5132
04:08:39,810 --> 04:08:43,310
Once we get a cow, I'm a ghost of my word.

5133
04:08:44,430 --> 04:08:44,870
Meow.

5134
04:08:45,770 --> 04:08:47,550
I am a ghost of my word.

5135
04:08:48,490 --> 04:08:51,370
I said I would not unstream until we get a cow.

5136
04:08:52,650 --> 04:08:53,850
What's the series goal?

5137
04:08:54,170 --> 04:08:57,210
I want to defeat the Ender dragon but, I also really want to see.

5138
04:08:58,350 --> 04:08:58,790
Meow.

5139
04:08:59,450 --> 04:09:01,130
I want... I don't know if I'll be doing this all day...

5140
04:09:01,130 --> 04:09:01,130
Meow.

5141
04:09:01,130 --> 04:09:02,370
I don't know if it's like weekly or anything like that.

5142
04:09:02,970 --> 04:09:04,710
But I also want to see...

5143
04:09:06,130 --> 04:09:08,670
Whatever the hell this thing... what was it?

5144
04:09:10,050 --> 04:09:10,710
Where did it go?

5145
04:09:11,290 --> 04:09:12,130
Wait, what is this?

5146
04:09:12,210 --> 04:09:13,190
Oh, Wolf Farmer!

5147
04:09:13,830 --> 04:09:15,150
Wait, I need an armadillo!

5148
04:09:16,990 --> 04:09:19,250
There's so much stuff that they've added to this game.

5149
04:09:28,310 --> 04:09:29,370
I'm gonna get rid of him.

5150
04:09:29,710 --> 04:09:32,050
Why are you... what is... what is... what are you...

5151
04:09:32,590 --> 04:09:34,130
What are you being refreshed upon?

5152
04:09:35,630 --> 04:09:36,750
It's creeping me out.

5153
04:09:36,750 --> 04:09:37,610
Leave.

5154
04:09:39,310 --> 04:09:40,450
Please leave.

5155
04:09:41,170 --> 04:09:41,810
Okay.

5156
04:09:47,680 --> 04:09:48,960
They added cows.

5157
04:09:49,420 --> 04:09:49,880
Wait.

5158
04:09:51,000 --> 04:09:52,480
Weren't cows always?

5159
04:09:55,980 --> 04:09:57,500
He went night-night.

5160
04:09:57,720 --> 04:09:57,980
Yeah.

5161
04:10:02,430 --> 04:10:04,970
He was refreshing himself at the composter.

5162
04:10:04,990 --> 04:10:05,670
That's disgusting!

5163
04:10:06,530 --> 04:10:07,510
That's nasty!

5164
04:10:09,410 --> 04:10:11,110
Oh my god, it reeks!

5165
04:10:11,470 --> 04:10:12,730
What did he do?

5166
04:10:13,990 --> 04:10:15,110
He composted!

5167
04:10:15,570 --> 04:10:16,690
Oh my god.

5168
04:10:18,390 --> 04:10:18,950
Disgusting.

5169
04:10:19,290 --> 04:10:20,950
He added soil to the thing.

5170
04:10:21,210 --> 04:10:21,450
No!

5171
04:10:23,310 --> 04:10:24,830
That's so awful!

5172
04:10:27,750 --> 04:10:29,110
Right in front of me!

5173
04:10:33,960 --> 04:10:36,300
You sleep a block away... I don't put...

5174
04:10:36,300 --> 04:10:39,000
I don't put... I don't put piss and shit in there!

5175
04:10:39,040 --> 04:10:40,000
I put literal moss!

5176
04:10:40,220 --> 04:10:40,820
It's different!

5177
04:10:42,320 --> 04:10:43,620
That's not my toilet!

5178
04:10:47,300 --> 04:10:48,680
There's a whole void!

5179
04:10:55,610 --> 04:10:57,210
Moss has bugs in it.

5180
04:10:57,650 --> 04:10:58,210
So?

5181
04:11:03,140 --> 04:11:05,000
It still rots.

5182
04:11:08,240 --> 04:11:11,700
Look, if we're going to get into the very specifics of Minecraft.

5183
04:11:11,980 --> 04:11:13,700
I've murdered several people.

5184
04:11:16,060 --> 04:11:18,280
It's a doggy-dog world out there, okay?

5185
04:11:18,500 --> 04:11:19,740
And sometimes...

5186
04:11:19,740 --> 04:11:20,700
You know...

5187
04:11:20,700 --> 04:11:22,160
You have to live next to your toilet.

5188
04:11:27,330 --> 04:11:29,150
He's trying to help you with composing.

5189
04:11:29,170 --> 04:11:30,170
Look at all these diamonds!

5190
04:11:31,750 --> 04:11:34,270
We have so many.

5191
04:11:34,870 --> 04:11:36,590
I'm gonna start making some of this copper.

5192
04:11:37,270 --> 04:11:41,770
Maybe we can... What can I make with copper?

5193
04:11:42,790 --> 04:11:44,590
You could put the bed anywhere else.

5194
04:11:47,670 --> 04:11:49,510
You guys are so judgmental.

5195
04:11:51,010 --> 04:11:52,990
You guys are so judgmental!

5196
04:11:54,610 --> 04:11:55,730
What if I like it?

5197
04:11:56,310 --> 04:11:57,410
Oh wait, leave the bed.

5198
04:11:57,570 --> 04:11:59,210
Hold on, I want my cat to sleep with me.

5199
04:11:59,390 --> 04:11:59,790
Come here.

5200
04:12:02,790 --> 04:12:03,490
Come here, cat!

5201
04:12:10,290 --> 04:12:15,310
Oh my god, the purrs of a cat are like the best thing ever invented.

5202
04:12:19,980 --> 04:12:23,820
The best thing ever invented is making a cat purr.

5203
04:12:24,120 --> 04:12:24,740
You know?

5204
04:12:26,160 --> 04:12:27,700
I didn't know it would do that.

5205
04:12:28,240 --> 04:12:28,760
I know!

5206
04:12:28,880 --> 04:12:29,920
It's so cute!

5207
04:12:32,040 --> 04:12:33,720
It's so cute.

5208
04:12:36,440 --> 04:12:37,220
Oh!

5209
04:12:37,220 --> 04:12:40,580
Did you bring me some cocoa beans?

5210
04:12:42,980 --> 04:12:45,720
My cat brought me cocoa beans!

5211
04:12:48,860 --> 04:12:50,040
Nature's ASMR.

5212
04:12:50,620 --> 04:12:51,220
It's true.

5213
04:12:53,080 --> 04:12:54,220
It's true.

5214
04:12:55,220 --> 04:12:56,000
How?

5215
04:12:56,300 --> 04:12:56,840
Don't...

5216
04:12:56,840 --> 04:12:56,860
Don't do that.

5217
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:56,860
Don't do that.

5218
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:56,860
Don't do that.

5219
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:56,860
Don't do that.

5220
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:56,860
Don't do that.

5221
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:56,860
Don't do that.

5222
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:56,860
Don't do that.

5223
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:56,860
Don't do that.

5224
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:56,860
Don't do that.

5225
04:12:56,860 --> 04:12:57,140
Don't do that.

5226
04:12:57,140 --> 04:12:57,140
Don't do that.

5227
04:12:57,140 --> 04:12:57,140
Don't do that.

5228
04:12:57,140 --> 04:12:57,140
Don't do that.

5229
04:12:57,140 --> 04:12:57,140
Don't do that.

5230
04:12:57,140 --> 04:12:57,140
Don't do that.

5231
04:12:57,140 --> 04:12:57,140
Don't do that.

5232
04:12:57,140 --> 04:12:57,140
Don't...

5233
04:12:57,140 --> 04:12:57,580
Ask how.

5234
04:12:58,700 --> 04:12:59,220
Rude!

5235
04:13:01,240 --> 04:13:02,500
Are you sure those are beans?

5236
04:13:05,360 --> 04:13:06,000
Tow...tow pounds!

5237
04:13:07,760 --> 04:13:08,580
Tow pounds!

5238
04:13:13,920 --> 04:13:16,800
Bed right next to a tree might not be the best plan.

5239
04:13:17,200 --> 04:13:19,740
Might wake up too right ill spider.

5240
04:13:20,260 --> 04:13:22,800
Hold on, let me get rid of my isn't sorry.

5241
04:13:25,040 --> 04:13:26,080
Tow pounds...

5242
04:13:27,840 --> 04:13:28,880
Tow pounds...

5243
04:13:28,880 --> 04:13:29,840
Tow pounds...

5244
04:13:33,050 --> 04:13:53,010
I love Paz's toe beans because since she's a tortie, since she's not completely black, one of her toe beans is pink, like her one paw, and then the other paw, her toe beans are black.

5245
04:13:53,550 --> 04:13:54,850
So it's really cute!

5246
04:13:56,850 --> 04:13:58,130
It's so cute!

5247
04:13:58,390 --> 04:13:59,610
She's so cute!

5248
04:14:00,410 --> 04:14:02,650
She's such a bad cat.

5249
04:14:05,350 --> 04:14:07,110
Torties are very cute, yeah.

5250
04:14:12,690 --> 04:14:14,230
We're really digging through this.

5251
04:14:15,270 --> 04:14:17,070
We're almost to 3500.

5252
04:14:23,330 --> 04:14:25,330
Is he on top of my cow?

5253
04:14:26,090 --> 04:14:27,410
Oh, he's in my...

5254
04:14:27,410 --> 04:14:28,610
Well guys...

5255
04:14:29,710 --> 04:14:30,070
Move.

5256
04:14:31,190 --> 04:14:31,990
We did it!

5257
04:14:38,860 --> 04:14:40,060
We got a cow!

5258
04:14:40,140 --> 04:14:40,860
Where are you going, cow?

5259
04:14:41,060 --> 04:14:42,120
Cow, cow, cow, cow, cow.

5260
04:14:42,480 --> 04:14:43,000
Cow, cow!

5261
04:14:43,500 --> 04:14:44,480
How did you get up there?

5262
04:14:44,740 --> 04:14:45,420
No, no, no, no.

5263
04:14:45,560 --> 04:14:46,360
Go back inside.

5264
04:14:46,700 --> 04:14:47,220
Go there.

5265
04:14:47,560 --> 04:14:47,920
Okay.

5266
04:14:48,080 --> 04:14:48,880
I'm gonna go...

5267
04:14:48,880 --> 04:14:49,580
I'm gonna put him...

5268
04:14:49,580 --> 04:14:50,580
I'm gonna lock him up in here.

5269
04:14:53,600 --> 04:14:54,700
We're gonna lock him up.

5270
04:14:54,740 --> 04:14:55,560
We're gonna lock him up.

5271
04:15:00,410 --> 04:15:00,770
Perfect.

5272
04:15:02,170 --> 04:15:02,770
There we go.

5273
04:15:05,050 --> 04:15:06,570
He has enough room.

5274
04:15:06,570 --> 04:15:07,630
Probably.

5275
04:15:08,010 --> 04:15:10,810
And then also, we can drink his milk.

5276
04:15:11,250 --> 04:15:13,430
Oh, I lost my bucket.

5277
04:15:15,250 --> 04:15:17,970
I lost my buckets when I died!

5278
04:15:19,230 --> 04:15:19,970
Oops.

5279
04:15:22,770 --> 04:15:23,510
Yes?

5280
04:15:23,710 --> 04:15:24,010
What?

5281
04:15:24,310 --> 04:15:24,650
Can...

5282
04:15:24,650 --> 04:15:25,490
Excuse me?

5283
04:15:25,670 --> 04:15:26,770
You're so close.

5284
04:15:28,490 --> 04:15:30,190
We could order a wolf.

5285
04:15:34,880 --> 04:15:35,620
Huh.

5286
04:15:42,510 --> 04:15:44,150
Male cows don't have milk.

5287
04:15:45,130 --> 04:15:46,710
We can drink her milk.

5288
04:15:47,890 --> 04:15:48,630
How do they...

5289
04:15:49,150 --> 04:15:50,270
How do they mate them?

5290
04:15:51,290 --> 04:15:51,790
Hold on.

5291
04:15:51,830 --> 04:15:52,790
Let's make another bucket.

5292
04:15:53,770 --> 04:15:54,150
Oh.

5293
04:16:05,430 --> 04:16:06,210
Milky way?

5294
04:16:12,720 --> 04:16:13,120
Delicious.

5295
04:16:14,120 --> 04:16:15,420
Why is my cat on the ground?

5296
04:16:15,700 --> 04:16:16,540
Why is my cat...

5297
04:16:16,540 --> 04:16:17,000
What did you do?

5298
04:16:17,460 --> 04:16:18,240
What did you do?

5299
04:16:18,420 --> 04:16:19,220
What did you do?

5300
04:16:20,760 --> 04:16:21,660
Why are you on the ground?

5301
04:16:22,900 --> 04:16:23,800
Get on the bed.

5302
04:16:25,140 --> 04:16:26,560
Get on the bed right now.

5303
04:16:28,420 --> 04:16:28,860
Yeah.

5304
04:16:34,430 --> 04:16:35,090
There we go.

5305
04:16:37,370 --> 04:16:38,930
Freak phantom drinking his milk.

5306
04:16:40,050 --> 04:16:40,870
You wouldn't?

5307
04:16:42,330 --> 04:16:43,770
You wouldn't tell me you wouldn't...

5308
04:16:43,770 --> 04:16:47,890
You're telling me you would not drink the milk of this precious cow that was delivered from the heavens.

5309
04:16:50,710 --> 04:16:51,390
Anyways, guys.

5310
04:16:51,730 --> 04:16:52,870
Thank you for tonight.

5311
04:16:53,110 --> 04:16:54,210
I'm so sleepy.

5312
04:16:54,210 --> 04:16:54,790
Sleepy tired.

5313
04:16:55,890 --> 04:16:57,690
I'm gonna go to bed now.

5314
04:16:57,870 --> 04:17:00,150
And I suggest you all do the same.

5315
04:17:01,430 --> 04:17:02,290
Oh my gosh.

5316
04:17:02,310 --> 04:17:03,310
It's been four hours.

5317
04:17:03,430 --> 04:17:04,050
Holy cow.

5318
04:17:04,750 --> 04:17:05,730
Holy cow.

5319
04:17:09,450 --> 04:17:10,050
Yeah.

5320
04:17:14,230 --> 04:17:15,970
I'm gonna head out.

5321
04:17:16,470 --> 04:17:17,850
I'll see you guys later.

5322
04:17:18,170 --> 04:17:20,110
Thank you for...

5323
04:17:21,810 --> 04:17:24,750
For watching, hanging out with me, welcoming me back home.

5324
04:17:25,170 --> 04:17:26,890
Sorry if I was a little low energy.

5325
04:17:27,250 --> 04:17:28,990
Just because, you know, it was...

5326
04:17:28,990 --> 04:17:30,690
It's me being tired.

5327
04:17:30,790 --> 04:17:32,430
I've been up for so long.

5328
04:17:32,670 --> 04:17:33,070
But...

5329
04:17:33,870 --> 04:17:35,610
I'm gonna get some good sleep.

5330
04:17:36,830 --> 04:17:38,330
Why don't you eat the pufferfish?

5331
04:17:38,610 --> 04:17:38,870
Oh.

5332
04:17:38,890 --> 04:17:39,270
Okay.

5333
04:17:42,190 --> 04:17:43,410
Did I lose the puffer?

5334
04:17:43,470 --> 04:17:43,690
No.

5335
04:17:49,150 --> 04:17:49,630
Whoa.

5336
04:17:50,450 --> 04:17:50,930
Whoa.

5337
04:17:51,390 --> 04:17:51,870
Whoa.

5338
04:18:08,350 --> 04:18:09,610
That was crazy.

5339
04:18:11,750 --> 04:18:13,410
Oh, I think I'm about to die though.

5340
04:18:14,670 --> 04:18:15,930
Let's eat some watermelon.

5341
04:18:23,860 --> 04:18:24,460
Oh.

5342
04:18:24,540 --> 04:18:25,100
Oh no.

5343
04:18:25,280 --> 04:18:25,420
Oh.

5344
04:18:28,690 --> 04:18:29,290
Uh.

5345
04:18:30,870 --> 04:18:31,730
Guru guru.

5346
04:18:36,390 --> 04:18:37,770
This is how I die.

5347
04:18:38,650 --> 04:18:40,430
A sad Victorian child.

5348
04:18:40,750 --> 04:18:41,930
Getting the black plague.

5349
04:18:42,730 --> 04:18:43,330
Oh.

5350
04:18:43,350 --> 04:18:44,550
Cool.

5351
04:18:44,550 --> 04:18:45,270
You discovered it.

5352
04:18:45,630 --> 04:18:47,450
You discovered my lore.

5353
04:18:48,910 --> 04:18:50,210
And now...

5354
04:18:51,750 --> 04:18:55,990
And now, I have no other reason to be here.

5355
04:18:56,250 --> 04:18:58,450
You discovered how I died.

5356
04:19:00,610 --> 04:19:01,690
I am...

5357
04:19:01,690 --> 04:19:03,170
I am truly satisfied.

5358
04:19:03,510 --> 04:19:04,550
I'm seeing the light.

5359
04:19:06,230 --> 04:19:09,670
I can finally trust in peace now!

5360
04:19:10,870 --> 04:19:13,330
I can know I will no longer believe in myfourth day I went to hell.

5361
04:19:13,350 --> 04:19:19,950
A sad Victorian child... who died of syphilis?

5362
04:19:20,230 --> 04:19:21,510
Plague.

5363
04:19:25,220 --> 04:19:26,500
Everything.

5364
04:19:28,600 --> 04:19:29,760
Goodbye everybody.

5365
04:19:30,480 --> 04:19:31,760
Goodbye!

5366
04:19:33,340 --> 04:19:34,980
Oh, sorry.

5367
04:19:37,580 --> 04:19:38,600
Oh wait, hold on.

5368
04:19:39,300 --> 04:19:40,580
One second.

5369
04:19:59,670 --> 04:20:00,590
What was I doing?

5370
04:20:00,730 --> 04:20:01,830
Oh, okay, there we go.

5371
04:20:01,910 --> 04:20:02,370
Okay!

5372
04:20:04,050 --> 04:20:05,050
Now go!

5373
04:20:06,190 --> 04:20:07,730
Go into the light!

5374
04:20:08,930 --> 04:20:11,250
Go into the light!

5375
04:20:48,290 --> 04:20:49,090
There you go.

5376
04:20:53,850 --> 04:20:54,770
There you go.

5377
04:20:54,890 --> 04:20:55,550
Go on.

5378
04:20:56,090 --> 04:20:56,570
Go on.

04:20:57,850 --> 04:20:58,650
Go on.

5381
04:20:59,490 --> 04:21:00,370
There you go.

5382
04:21:01,230 --> 04:21:02,270
That's how it's done.

5383
04:21:02,370 --> 04:21:03,210
It burns!

5384
04:21:04,590 --> 04:21:05,150
Go outside!

5385
04:21:05,550 --> 04:21:06,130
Touch price!

5386
04:21:07,090 --> 04:21:08,490
Be a normie.

5387
04:21:10,530 --> 04:21:11,590
Don't be normal.

5388
04:21:11,950 --> 04:21:12,590
Don't be normal.

5389
04:21:17,580 --> 04:21:18,160
Oh, hold on.

5390
04:21:18,280 --> 04:21:19,720
I also... I hold on too.

5391
04:21:23,120 --> 04:21:23,840
Hold on.

5392
04:21:24,040 --> 04:21:24,660
Hold on too.

5393
04:21:26,880 --> 04:21:28,000
Hold on.

5394
04:21:28,100 --> 04:21:28,720
Hold on too.

5395
04:21:29,680 --> 04:21:30,420
Hold on.

5396
04:21:32,460 --> 04:21:33,220
Hold on.

5397
04:21:36,450 --> 04:21:37,010
Oh!

5398
04:21:37,090 --> 04:21:37,730
Oh wait.

5399
04:21:41,250 --> 04:21:41,590
Yeah.

Yeah.

04:21:43,910 --> 04:21:44,590
Yeah.

5402
04:21:45,730 --> 04:21:46,410
Yeah.

04:21:47,830 --> 04:21:48,510
Yeah.

5404
04:21:48,510 --> 04:21:48,850
Yeah.

04:21:50,090 --> 04:21:50,430

04:21:52,250 --> 04:21:56,190
