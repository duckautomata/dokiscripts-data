1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,200
Guys, this is scuffed because it is.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,100
It's scuffed because it is.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,170
Wait, wait, wait.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,110
Sorry.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,110
Hold on, hold on.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,360
I got it up.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,460
I got the direct up.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,420
I got the direct up.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,940
Direct time, direct time, direct time, direct time.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,640
Am I live?

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,000
Is this working?

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,760
Two minutes until oxygen zero.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,540
I just played this game.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,520
Please help me, Date!

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,560
Oh my gosh, the Somnium files.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,100
I haven't played this yet though.

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,160
No way!

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,600
Yay!

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,160
I was like, as soon as I saw the eye, I was like, I know that eye.

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,120
What was the first thing that got announced, you guys?

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,840
We are in space!

22
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,360
Oh Dragon Quest!

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,140
Kaname Date.

24
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,360
No sleep.

25
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,300
That means no sleep for Minto Phantom.

26
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,960
That's me!

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
I'm the supernatural!

28
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:10,880
Astro!

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,920
I love Dante.

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,340
Kaname Dante.

31
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:30,360
A classic Atlus Action RPG returns with remastered HD graphics and enhanced gameplay.

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:39,220
Set in the capital city in the year Taisho 20, Raido Kuzunoha makes his living as an apprentice detective.

33
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,940
Taisho era outfits, my beloved.

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,640
Sorry guys, I'm still setting up a little bit.

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,180
Sorry for the skunk.

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,220
Can you guys hear it okay?

37
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,640
Are these like, are these games like, made?

38
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,220
Are you okay?

39
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,080
I like the art style so much.

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,800
Raido.

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,900
Would something be a rip off if it's by the same company?

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,040
Wait, this actually looks so cool.

43
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,280
I don't know if I'd stream it, but I would play it.

44
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,940
Oh yeah!

45
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,280
Orb.

46
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,160
Where is the orb?

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,120
Orb.

48
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,680
It's not Pacman.

49
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,240
It's Pacman.

50
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,220
Pacman.

51
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:21,940
Pacman.

52
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,700
No!

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,740
It's Pacman!

54
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,300
Wait!

55
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,660
It's actual Pacman!

56
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,900
I heard...

57
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,980
What?

58
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,420
What is his goal?

59
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,120
What does he want?

60
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,260
Oh my god!

61
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,980
Guys, I don't think Pacman should be given this much power.

62
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,740
Maybe the ghosts were right.

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
Maybe Pacman is the evil guy.

64
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,360
What?

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,960
Oh wait.

66
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,760
The symbol looks familiar.

67
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,440
Oh yes!

68
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,340
Patapon!

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Didn't they...

70
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,640
When did we...wait.

71
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,280
I feel like Patapon was...

72
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,540
I feel like this was announced recently, no?

73
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,760
Patapon!

74
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,260
Patapon!

75
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,360
Patapon!

76
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,740
It was, right?

77
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,260
I feel like Patapon was announced recently.

78
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,640
Or was it Astrobot?

79
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,300
I thought there was an announcement recently.

80
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,120
Am I crazy?

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,720
Definitely come up on the street before.

82
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,060
Yeah!

83
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,580
Because I've never heard of it before.

84
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,840
They're so cute!

85
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,500
I want to play this.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,100
It's Red Patapon.

87
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,660
Call?

88
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,360
It was in Astrobot.

89
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,220
Maybe that's why we were talking about the Patapon.

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,660
This is where your new life begins.

91
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,610
Story of Seasons.

92
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,530
My man has no thoughts behind his eyes.

93
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,110
He's like, my name is Hans.

94
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,110
I love Farm Simulator.

95
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,930
I love Farm Simulator!

96
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,670
Inspiring, honestly.

97
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,750
My wife!

98
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,810
Oh my god!

99
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,550
Actually, my wife...oh wait.

100
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,690
I'm going to change my phone's mic.

101
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,230
I can't because I have my glasses on.

102
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,190
Happy International Thursday!

103
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,750
Happy International Thursday!

104
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,810
Grand Bazaar!

105
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,810
August 27th.

106
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:57,930
Marvelous.

107
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,390
I'm cute with glasses.

108
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,210
Duh, but I don't like my glasses.

109
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,530
They hurt my eye or my face.

110
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,550
What am I looking at?

111
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,850
What are you snapping about?

112
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,600
It's Metal Gear.

113
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,410
Oh!

114
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,560
Metroid time.

115
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,580
Monster Hunter Duh!

116
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,120
Samus!

117
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,880
As a glasses person, I feel your pain.

118
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,460
Orple.

119
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,880
Viewrose.

120
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,120
What?

121
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,720
Please take a look at this.

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,700
She's scanning?

123
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,940
She must scan stone figures.

124
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,080
She must scan.

125
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
Beetle variant nest.

126
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,380
I ain't reading all that.

127
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,080
Blast.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,200
Yeah, because she's with me.

129
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,560
We're a bit of a thing.

130
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,030
Little guys.

131
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,570
Big guys.

132
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,950
Now that the collab is over I can't stop yawning.

133
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,770
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

134
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,070
Psychic abilities.

135
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,690
What?

136
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,210
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,830
Oh!

138
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,210
What?

139
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,510
Oh my God!

140
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,290
Aimbot!

141
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,770
This script is kind of killing me.

142
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,010
They allow her to control the things with her mind.

143
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,670
They allow her to open doors.

144
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,110
Wow!

145
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,230
So pretty!

146
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,310
Pinball.

147
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,190
It's the thing.

148
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,730
Saku!

149
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,670
I really wanted to do this direct watch along because I won't be able to do it next week.

150
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,250
In case you were wondering why I kind of scrambled together for this.

151
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,110
This ability allows Samus to do things she normally can't do.

152
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,890
Red Samus.

153
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,450
Red Samus!

154
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,290
Red Samus!

155
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,330
Color palette change.

156
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,850
More headlines.

157
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,790
Oh yeah baby.

158
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,410
Oh yeah baby.

159
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,750
I like the mimic there.

160
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,470
The little mimic box is cute.

161
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,970
Oh this is that...

162
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,930
Oh this is...wait this is not at all what I...

163
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,470
Gaston!

164
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,110
It is a little hat!

165
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,230
Oh my God!

166
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,750
I'm busty.

167
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,050
Am I going to kill them?

168
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,970
Am I going to murder them?

169
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,790
Yes boss!

170
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,570
Oh my God look at Gaston man spreading in the back.

171
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,750
Oh my God Gaston!

172
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,390
This is absolutely cursed.

173
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,150
What the hell is this?

174
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,710
This is cursed.

175
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,130
This is so witchy.

176
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,590
Everything is witchy.

177
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,990
Wait this looks so cute.

178
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,370
I love Twisted Wonderland.

179
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,570
I thought the same thing.

180
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,690
What in the twist is this?

181
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,870
Is this a...

182
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,170
Chocofish!

183
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

184
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,790
This looks so cute.

185
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,030
It will confirm to appear in Villain Cafe.

186
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,890
Am I a villain?

187
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,790
Am I the bad guy?

188
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,030
Oh my God!

189
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,870
Wow they are all flying together.

190
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,410
So cute!

191
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,670
Uh oh, graduation.

192
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,450

That was Marvel Cosmic Invasion where you'll battle as a tag team of different superheroes.

373
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,090
Next is our last game announcement.

374
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,410
What?

375
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,210
Already?

376
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,550
Wait, but it's only been 30 minutes.

377
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,090
What?

378
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:38,930
No.

379
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,110
No.

380
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:40,910
You guys!

381
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:41,810
You guys!

382
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,510
You guys!

383
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:42,910
You guys!

384
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,750
You guys!

385
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,450
You guys!

386
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,710
Oh my god, you guys!

387
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,710
Oh my god!

388
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,190
No!

389
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:49,930
No!

390
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,150
No!

391
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,590
No way!

392
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,340
Tomodachi Life, living the dream.

393
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,080
I told you guys!

394
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,020
I told you guys!

395
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,180
I told you everybody!

396
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,640
I told you all!

397
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:37,660
I said I wasn't going to stream the direct and they would announce Tomodachi Life and they did!

398
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,300
That was Tomodachi Life, living the dream.

399
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,540
Yeah!

400
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,820
Oh my god!

401
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,160
Yeah!

402
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:51,920
It's happening!

403
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,900
I am!

404
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,260
I am Mr. Nintendo!

405
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:00,920
Thank you!

406
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,520
I tricked them into announcing Tomodachi Life 2!

407
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,460
You're welcome everybody!

408
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,940
Here's Mr. Miyamoto to introduce us.

409
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,560
To me?

410
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:31,940
Me?

411
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:50,380
We continue to broadcast Nintendo Direct presentations, but we're also launching a new channel based on the concept of delivering information to you directly.

412
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,400
This is a smart device app called Nintendo Today.

413
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,840
I'll never be able to miss a Direct now!

414
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,120
In the app you can view different Nintendo events.

415
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,420
We will also be delivering all sorts of content about Nintendo games and characters every day.

416
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,560
Thank you!

417
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,360
I got...I got a Japanese Direct?

418
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,860
Oh my god!

419
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,660
I must tweet!

420
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,140
I must tweet!

421
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,560
I told you all!

422
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,060
I can't believe it happened!

423
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,330
What can I say?

424
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,310
You're welcome!

425
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,100
For those who don't have Twitter...

426
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,820
I made a tweet literally yesterday and I said I can't do a Nintendo Direct watch along tomorrow.

427
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,000
And because of that they'll announce Tomodachi Life 2.

428
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
You're welcome!

429
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,980
I can't believe it!

430
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,640
And then this morning, only this morning, I actually made the thumbnail and everything.

431
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:01,200
Because this morning, Otiki-san from the...I did a collab just like literally like an hour ago.

432
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:08,480
And Otiki-san was just like, oh I can only play until 11pm JST, which is 10am, which is the start time of the Direct.

433
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,920
So I was just like, oh, okay, I can make it.

434
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,420
I can make it really fast.

435
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,460
And then!

436
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,140
And then!

437
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,470
I can't believe!

438
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,970
I can't believe!

439
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:33,500
Actually, when I first saw the beach and stuff, I was just like Animal Crossing.

440
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,880
But that was just like, no, it doesn't look like the Animal Crossing.

441
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,420
It looked like a little jankier than Animal Crossing.

442
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:47,380
And then I saw the little person sleeping, and then I saw the poo, and then I was like, that's Tomodachi Life humor.

443
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,380
I can't believe it!

444
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,320
Oh my gosh, am I the leaker?

445
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,700
Is Nintendo going to come after me?

446
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,180
They announced a new Super Robot Wars with Macross Delta on the JP Direct.

447
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,480
No!

448
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,960
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the super!

449
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
Nintendo is going to get you double crossing them.

450
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,840
So,

451
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,550
I did want to say real quick, I'm sorry for starting the Direct late.

452
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,410
The first thing was Dragon Quest, so sorry that I missed out on that.

453
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,290
But, WDirect!

454
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:34,690
WDirect!

455
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:42,050
And sorry that it was kind of scuffed, and there was no intro, and no nothing, and everything, everything.

456
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,150
I'm so happy!

457
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,370
I'm so happy!

458
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,650
This has been fun, please get some sleep.

459
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,450
Thank you!

460
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,950
Thank you so much Neosurfer for Super Chat.

461
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,110
I can't believe it!

462
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,670
I'm going to cry!

463
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,800
Well, I'm not living at all, but...

464
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,520
Oh my god.

465
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,280
This feels like the end of a journey.

466
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:33,380
You guys, for the past couple of, I don't know, for the past however many Nintendo Directs that I've watched along, I've put Tomodachi Life 2.

467
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,700
I've wished it every single time.

468
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,820
And I know so many others have too.

469
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,180
So many others have too.

470
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,020
And so finally...

471
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,360
Finally!

472
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,280
Finally we got it!

473
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,360
What do I put?

474
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,680
Now what do I do?

475
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,740
As a ghost I had, you know, as a ghost I was like, I must...

476
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,340
I had unfinished business, Tomodachi Life 2!

477
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,400
What do I do now?

478
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,220
Manifest Bloodborne?

479
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,280
I don't think Bloodborne would be in a Nintendo Direct.

480
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,700
I don't think so.

481
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:33,800
Rhythm Heaven and Tomodachi and Hotshot Golf, everything.

482
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,200
You hype for Raidou?

483
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,300
Actually I am pretty hyped for that, that was fun.

484
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,520
Gosh, now we wait for Tomodachi 3!

485
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,740
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it.

486
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,800
And there were some people that were just like, oh man...

487
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,120
Oh man...

488
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,660
They are not going to announce Tomodachi Life 2 today because they are going to announce it probably next week.

489
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,540
But I think next week is mostly about the Switch 2, no?

490
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,540
I don't know, maybe they will announce some games for it.

491
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,540
But I guess starting titles, no?

492
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,180
Did they show Silksong?

493
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,480
Yes they did!

494
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,180
Remember how much you still want to annoy Matara-Kan, so true.

495
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,040
So true.

496
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,580
Evil, sorry, sorry, no, sorry.

497
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,800
They announced my Silksong.

498
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,040
Sorry, sorry, I got mistaken.

499
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,720
I used all my energy.

500
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,220
I used all my energy.

501
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,020
I'm so tired.

502
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,620
Profit Minto.

503
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,680
Don't even joke, I'm sorry.

504
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,480
Maybe Silksong next week.

505
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,440
But yeah, next week I 100% cannot do a direct watch-along.

506
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,660
So sorry about that.

507
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,180
I actually have an appointment in the morning.

508
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,380
That's why I was just like, I really want to at least get one of them in.

509
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,600
So I was able to do this one.

510
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,680
And...

511
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,640
It was so worth it.

512
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,220
Tomodachi Life 2!

513
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,860
Yeah,

514
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,800
I think it's just Switch 2 news though, I think.

515
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,640
Maybe I won't watch and they'll announce Silksong, you're welcome.

516
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,880
Tomodachi Life 3 announced next direct.

517
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,260
Yeah, they're already...

518
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,260
They're like working on Tomodachi Life 50 probably.

519
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,640
Oh my gosh, I'm...

520
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,960
This raises so many questions, like...

521
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,060
The Mii creation, are they gonna follow from that...

522
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,240
Whatever that Mii RPG...

523
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,340
Whatever the hell that was, are they gonna follow that?

524
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,640
So we get crazy looking Miis.

525
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,420
Oh gosh, and then there was like...

526
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,140
You get to go around the island.

527
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,260
Yeah, Miitopia, Miitopia.

528
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,460
Yeah, like...

529
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,920
I need to know more!

530
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,180
I need to know!

531
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,820
They said... Wait, when did they say?

532
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,420
When did they say?

533
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,220
And the voices sound just as stupid, I can't wait.

534
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,240
2026...

535
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,320
No, make it 2026 right now.

536
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,680
Make it 2026 right now!

537
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,480
Okay, my voice... My throat hurts, so I'm gonna go rest.

538
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,380
Thank you everybody.

539
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,220
We did it fam!

540
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,500
We did it reddit!

541
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,700
We did it!

542
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,060
It's over.

543
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,840
Tomodachi Life.

544
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,320
No, hold on, I need to scan everything right now.

545
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,860
We have clothes, we have...

546
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,720
Quick build.

547
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,660
Do we get to customize our island?

548
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,580
I wonder, like...

549
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,660
Animal Crossing.

550
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,240
Look, they're even fighting!

551
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,660
Just like old times!

552
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,700
They kept all the stupid voices!

553
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,940
This is the best day of my afterlife ever!

554
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,380
Tomodachi Life.

555
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,920
Wait a second.

556
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,300
This, do you see this?

557
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,080
This logo looks like Caesarea.

558
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,820
I believe that is a restaurant.

559
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,800
Tomoriya!

560
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,240
Wait, that is just Caesarea!

561
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,510
That's just, that's just Caesarea!

562
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,610
But it's Tomozarea!

563
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,570
Oh my god!

564
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,230
We have Caesarea in the game!

565
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,020
Why did lying work for you?

566
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,080
What do you mean lying?

567
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,580
I hope they still have the PNG.

568
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,260
I saw it.

569
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,380
I saw it while they were fighting.

570
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,200
Hold on.

571
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,180
Look, look, look, look!

572
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,700
They have like little PNG, little PNG everythings.

573
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,380
Oh my god.

574
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,580
Cheap pasta and drink bar.

575
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,340
I'm so excited!

576
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,500
Caesarea Mansion.

577
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,460
Gosh, I'm so excited.

578
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,480
Look at that old man!

579
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,460
Break it down!

580
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,780
How refreshing.

581
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,700
It's too good!

582
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,760
It's too good!

583
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:10,880
That's mean.

584
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,520
That's literally...

585
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,580
This is literally mean right now.

586
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,640
Jumping for joy.

587
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,920
Because you lied about not streaming.

588
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,440
Well, I didn't lie.

589
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,060
I truly didn't think I would be able to.

590
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,980
Heard the news and came running in like a family member was in the hospital.

591
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,980
So happy.

592
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,960
So happy.

593
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Anyway, now I go for real.

594
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:45,720
I go for real.

595
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,620
I have another stream tonight.

596
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,620
So three Minto streams in one day.

597
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,980
I hope you guys have a good day.

598
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,520
And if I see you tonight, I'll see you.

599
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,880
And if I don't, I'll see you whenever I see you next.

600
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,540
Thank you guys.

601
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,740
Otsu Minto, Otsu Minto.

602
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,480
And have a good day, have a good night.

603
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,580
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.

604
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,220
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

605
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,640
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.

606
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,460
Tomodachi Life 2!

607
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,340
Gift

608
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,560
of Prophecy is just... I can't believe that I tricked them into actually announcing it.

609
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:52,220
They were like, oh Mint Phantom is not streaming so we definitely have to... I just can't believe it.

610
00:46:53,560 --> 00:47:00,360
I can't believe that because I was just like, I really can't do this direct today, that they actually announced it.

611
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,780
I can't believe it.

612
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,960
I can't believe it.

613
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,640
I can't believe it.

614
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:14,020
So if I hadn't been able to actually stream it, then I wouldn't have been able to react to it.

615
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,120
And that would have been so sad for me.

616
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,300
I'm just... Wow.

617
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,620
Wow.

618
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,240
Wow.

619
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,080
Okay, anyway, bye bye.
