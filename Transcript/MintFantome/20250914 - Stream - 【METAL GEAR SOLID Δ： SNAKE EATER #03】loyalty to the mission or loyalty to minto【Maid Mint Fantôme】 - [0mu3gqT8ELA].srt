1
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,040
Welcome back!

2
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,940
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

3
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,840
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, Minkie!

4
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,420
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!

5
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,540
Hi, hi, hi!

6
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,040
Today we plan on beating the game, so I have quite a bit to go.

7
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,480
But I want to beat it.

8
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,900
I want to beat it today.

9
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,780
We will definitely do some secret theater.

10
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,840
Especially at least watch the new ones.

11
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,000
And I would like to do some snake versus monkey.

12
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,300
People monkey.

13
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,960
But I guess that depends on how long it takes me to beat.

14
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,460
Welcome back to membership.

15
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,480
Thank you!

16
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,220
Thanks for the early stream.

17
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,340
Watch the fantastic reality archive and your performance is so good.

18
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,220
Thank you!

19
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,510
Are you excited to play Snake's Nightmare minigame?

20
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,210
Oh my gosh!

21
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,450
Wait, I was just thinking!

22
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,910
I was like, oh my gosh, wait!

23
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,190
When I saw...

24
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,610
Grasni-Grad torture room, I was like, wait!

25
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,070
I know what we're about to do!

26
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,130
And then also...

27
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,470
Also, also, also, also, also, also, also...

28
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,410
I'm so excited.

29
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:46,490
sorry I had a I had a thought and then I lost it no hold hold on oh this is this is very this is so those who don't know the the nightmare game oh my gosh it was in the original and now it's in this and they redid it with platinum so I wonder what it will feel like if it'll feel like

30
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:56,750
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and I also realized, oh my gosh, we still have one Cobra unit person to go through.

31
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,330
Which I've also been so excited about.

32
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,130
We have quite, actually quite a bit left of the game.

33
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,570
So it will probably be a longer stream.

34
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,910
But that's okay.

35
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,250
More Metal Gear.

36
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,730
Burley, happy birthday!

37
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,850
Happy, happy birthday.

38
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,310
I'm trying to keep the MGS series spoiler free.

39
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:17,750
Oh!

40
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,920
The save file is also red just like on the PS2.

41
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:31,940
Where?

42
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,060
Am I missing?

43
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:33,740
Where?

44
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,600
Iron cog hard 3.

45
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,940
Python snacker.

46
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,200
Yep, that's what we're playing today.

47
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,060
More and more of our metal gear!

48
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,620
Exactly!

49
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,500
On the load.

50
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,700
Oh my gosh!

51
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,500
It is!

52
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,020
I guess we have to load this one then instead of the auto-save, huh?

53
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,480
If I had just pressed continue.

54
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,240
What?

55
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,300
It actually is!

56
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,260
That's so cool.

57
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,800
Me even hiking up a mountain.

58
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,900
What a hill.

59
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,520
Oh my gosh.

60
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,580
This is going to be a lot of fun because there's a lot of really fun stuff we have left to do.

61
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,580
So let's just not waste any time.

62
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,700
Let's just get into it, huh?

63
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,600
Oh.

64
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,040
Oh my god.

65
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,060
Uh, my game.

66
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,480
Wait.

67
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,420
Wait, wait, wait.

68
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, gosh.

69
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,060
Nightmare game.

70
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,920
Ah, wait.

71
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,880
Wait, wait, wait.

72
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,020
Wait.

73
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,240
Wait.

74
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,260
Wait.

75
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:37,500
Wait.

76
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:37,660
No.

77
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,500
Oh, my God.

78
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,040
No way.

79
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,660
Hold on.

80
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,480
One moment, please.

81
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,160
Uh, uh, game, uh, specific, uh, nightmare.

82
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,200
Uh?

83
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,100
Oh my

84
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,620
gosh.

85
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,000
Wait.

86
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,960
This is crazy.

87
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,860
It feels like.

88
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:10,340
It feels like how, you know, an MGS4, when you switch to playing one in the dream.

89
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,760
It feels just like that.

90
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,060
That's so crazy.

91
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,640
Oh my gosh.

92
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,080
Guy Savage.

93
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,040
Whoa.

94
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,020
Wow.

95
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:30,810
Whoa.

96
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,290
Devil May solid.

97
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,090
It looked...

98
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,810
Wait, I don't remember it starting outside.

99
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,990
I don't remember the Guy Savage sequence very well, though.

100
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,010
I'll be honest.

101
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,630
Do I have to parry in this?

102
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,950
Please say no.

103
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,890
Oh, they're strong.

104
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,330
Oh, they're strong.

105
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:56,330
Oh!

106
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:56,950
What's happening?

107
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,410
Let's go.

108
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,870
How's the audio, by the way?

109
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,900
It's good?

110
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,040
Okay, thank you.

111
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,760
Quiet.

112
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,260
The game itself seems a little quiet.

113
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,040
Okay.

114
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,060
Oh, no.

115
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,620
Arnar, we're surrounded.

116
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,300
Clear.

117
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,160
Oh, okay.

118
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,040
Just throw me in there.

119
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,960
Throw me in, boss.

120
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,860
Oh, my gosh.

121
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,270
I'm just button-mashing.

122
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,270
This is so insane.

123
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,310
Oh, my gosh.

124
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,210
Oh, my gosh.

125
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,990
I'm going insane.

126
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,790
This is so cool.

127
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,450
Hey.

128
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:15,710
No.

129
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,710
Oh, he's still up?

130
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,690
Oh, there we go.

131
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,950
I thought, yeah, I remember Guy Savage being indoors.

132
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,550
The blood moon.

133
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,760
Hot dog indeed!

134
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,780
Vampire!

135
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,470
Oh my gosh!

136
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,470
Oh!

137
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,090
This is so cool!

138
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,610
Wait, I can't believe!

139
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,050
Oh.

140
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,930
Where is he?

141
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,450
Oh!

142
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,130
Oh!

143
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,310
Oh, there he is.

144
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,190
Oh my gosh.

145
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,930
Crazy, crazy.

146
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,650
The music even?

147
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,870
Like, what the hell?

148
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,770
Oh, where'd he go?

149
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,470
Oh, more Zombos.

150
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,030
Even in Metal Gear, I play Zombo game.

151
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,890
Oh, I don't think I got him.

152
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,410
Oh, yes, I did.

153
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:28,970
Okay, good.

154
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

155
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,560
whoa, whoa, whoa,

156
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,240
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

157
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,960
Oh, come on.

158
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,640
There we go.

159
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,340
Whoa, this is really nice when he gets surrounded.

160
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,200
Oh, look, come here.

161
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,620
Oh, my gosh.

162
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,640
There's so many of them!

163
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,320
Spin!

164
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:05,980
Spin!

165
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,880
This is so crazy.

166
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,100
I can't get over how crazy this is.

167
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,200
Crazy this is.

168
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:15,860
Oh.

169
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,360
Why so much effort?

170
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,620
I mean, it's awesome.

171
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,720
I just, like, what the heck?

172
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,900
How long does it go for?

173
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,520
I wonder!

174
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,500
What's happening?

175
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,020
Oh my god.

176
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,280
Oh no!

177
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,440
He's here too!

178
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,840
Oh my god.

179
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,220
Ah!

180
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Ah!

181
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,160
We're gonna spin?

182
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,020
We're gonna spin?

183
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,100
Spin?

184
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,500
We're gonna- Oh gosh!

185
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,040
Oh gosh!

186
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,390
Did I do it?

187
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,590
Spin to win!

188
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,730
Spin to win!

189
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,150
Oh, I savage.

190
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:26,780
Huh?

191
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,180
Oh, the game is back!

192
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:35,890
Fine.

193
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,590
Let me pull up metal...

194
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,330
Oh, that's back.

195
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,010
This is good.

196
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:39,530
We're fine.

197
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,650
Good morning, Snake!

198
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,000
Wow!

199
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,980
They completely redid it.

200
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,620
Like, it didn't look at all like how it was before.

201
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:12,700
Oh!

202
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,140
Hello!

203
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,920
Thank you!

204
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
There's so much food here!

205
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,560
Hi!

206
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,430
I had a dream where I was in a classroom with fellow wisps and you were the teacher.

207
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,590
You like blood-borne, don't you?

208
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,610
Oh wait, wrong- wait, there we go.

209
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,490
Let's get- let's get out.

210
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,210
This transmitter!

211
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,450
Wait, no.

212
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,830
I want to keep the transmitter.

213
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,250
I'm gonna keep the transmitter in.

214
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,410
We're gonna keep that in.

215
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,890
Yeah, we're gonna keep it in.

216
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,570
That guy was pretty savage.

217
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:06,050
For those who don't know, so in the original game, not in the HD collection, there was a...

218
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,810
There was a...

219
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,490
A dream sequence like that that you could unlock.

220
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,050
With, uh...

221
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,810
With...

222
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,850
Um, guys, where it had that, like, kind of demo of that game.

223
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,890
And just for this, they remade it, which is just so crazy.

224
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,110
Ronan, thank you!

225
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,170
Welcome back!

226
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,050
Perhaps in another life where Snake is in a legendary soldier, he could have been a really good game developer.

227
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,670
That's so cool.

228
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,930
That's so cool!

229
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,070
Oh my gosh!

230
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,750
Um, and it's...

231
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,990
Oh, we could fork it?

232
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,590
Um...

233
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,230
Oh, no, wait, I don't have my knife.

234
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,010
Wait, can I get it out with the fork?

235
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,850
Oh, no way!

236
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,930
We got it out with the fork!

237
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,270
That's so good.

238
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,690
Why are you so freaky?

239
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,950
Because I'm a ghost.

240
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,010
Wait.

241
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:11,690
Huh?

242
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,450
Time to eat!

243
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:14,790
Thank you!

244
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,790
Okay, now...

245
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,090
Let's give him...

246
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:19,650
the bat.

247
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,470
Oh, oops, hold on.

248
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,290
I can't aim.

249
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,430
I can't aim at all.

250
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,640
Wait, okay, there we go.

251
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:30,950
Huh?

252
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,030
It's gonna be its own game.

253
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,370
What?

254
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,230
You don't want this?

255
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,430
I believe that's how it was.

256
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:45,890
Oh, shoot.

257
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,270
I don't remember what the codec was.

258
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,270
Was it yummy?

259
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,790
I guess it was good.

260
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,090
Hello, Rat.

261
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,270
I hear them both.

262
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,690
I hear...

263
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,270
Go, go!

264
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,250
In one side and...

265
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,030
And...

266
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,910
And the other side.

267
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,170
Come here, Rat.

268
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,370
We're eating.

269
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,330
We're eating good.

270
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,530
What else does he want?

271
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,090
Oh, this one's spoiled.

272
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,830
Okay, this is good.

273
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,350
This is good.

274
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,960
144.75.

275
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,880
Okay, cool.

276
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,960
Wait, we'll wait.

277
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,200
I hear him over there, and then I hear...

278
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,960
Wait, let me make sure...

279
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,340
Okay, my headphones are on correctly.

280
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
Just make it sure.

281
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:45,920
Just make it sure.

282
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,220
You want that?

283
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,780
It's yours!

284
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,960
You can hear the flies.

285
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,780
At least Snake's nightmare was nowhere near as horrible Siggins.

286
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,840
Free food!

287
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,920
Got our single-action army.

288
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,240
I guess I should have given him any of the spoiled stuff, huh?

289
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,490
Beep.

290
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,170
Beep.

291
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,890
Oh,

292
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,340
wow.

293
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,580
You can see out the window and everything.

294
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,620
You're welcome.

295
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:49,600
guys how do i oh this is rotten oh sorry oh my stomach thank you brother

296
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:13,850
forgot to ask um oh snake you don't look so good Oh, his eyeball.

297
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,730
Oh, snake, it all looks so good.

298
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,010
I forgot to ask, how do I get the cutscene with Johnny?

299
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,710
I don't remember.

300
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,770
Gosh, look at this.

301
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,370
This is...

302
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,230
Oh my gosh.

303
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,010
Honestly, it looks better than I thought with all that he went through.

304
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,350
Three food?

305
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:31,890
Okay, okay.

306
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,810
Well, three food.

307
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,650
Okay, that's what I thought.

308
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:34,950
So what?

309
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,470
We just have to give him one more, no?

310
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,830
Or three good meals.

311
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,950
It's coming out!

312
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,570
Here it come!

313
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,670
Still going.

314
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,030
Still going.

315
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,450
I didn't think that was possible.

316
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,070
That's a record.

317
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,710
Well, this is even flush.

318
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,650
It's not the second flush.

319
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,280
We'll wait for him to give us more food then.

320
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,400
I want to be able to get the cute little cutscene.

321
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,180
It's so cute.

322
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,980
Yeah, but fake death points.

323
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,640
pill now too.

324
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,620
Sort of like solid snakes.

325
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,040
Catch up.

326
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,380
Skip.

327
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,400
No.

328
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,440
There's a couple ways he can get out.

329
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,320
Hey, hey!

330
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,150
Hey, Smelly!

331
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,470
Did you wash your hands?

332
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,670
Of course he don't look good, Minto.

333
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,150
He's missing an eye.

334
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:48,850
Hey!

335
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,130
I hope that cure goes away.

336
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,810
I hope they like...

337
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,750
I don't want it to just sit there the whole time, you know.

338
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,090
King of the poop What does that mean?

339
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,450
Hey!

340
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,630
I'm hungry!

341
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,430
Time to eat?

342
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,080
Ciao time!

343
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,040
What you give me?

344
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,440
Oh, frog!

345
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,800
Let's go!

346
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,020
Oh, here it is.

347
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't, uh, you have it.

348
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:25,840
Huh?

349
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,740
Huh?

350
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,620
He's so cute.

351
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,540
Huh?

352
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,540
Well, it's your loss.

353
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,240
It's for you, buddy!

354
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,690
Quiet down there, will ya?

355
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,950
It's actually so stupid.

356
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,970
He's actually the dumbest guy ever to exist.

357
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,390
Don't make fun of him?

358
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,090
What are you doing?

359
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,110
Instead of faking being sick for the guard snake, it's the guard sick instead.

360
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:01,730
Exactly!

361
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,530
Shut up in there, will ya?

362
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,650
Huh?

363
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,190
Look at why?

364
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,030
What are you looking for?

365
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,710
It's just me!

366
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,430
He is, but he's endearing.

367
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,230
Don't get me wrong, I love the guy so much.

368
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:22,750
Huh?

369
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:24,810
Huh?

370
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,050
Give me more food.

371
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,320
Don't get fed, you know.

372
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,620
Oh!

373
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,940
I'm sorry, Papa!

374
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,760
Papa, please!

375
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,800
Papa, feed me!

376
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
Kiss your feet, Papa!

377
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,270
What are you even looking for in here?

378
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,690
There's a whole lot of nothing, okay, buddy?

379
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,230
He isn't that after all.

380
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:03,910
He is.

381
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,630
We know that.

382
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,330
Oh?

383
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,370
Child time!

384
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,330
He's so sleepy.

385
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,750
Look at that.

386
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,670
The right side is a little...

387
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,810
a little messed up.

388
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,270
My stomach!

389
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:26,850
Again?

390
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:32,620
Oh, I can't hold it anymore.

391
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,500
The way he runs is so...

392
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,860
Hold on!

393
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,500
Hold it!

394
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,440
How do I...

395
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,580
Round two?

396
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,570
The waddle.

397
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,170
I know.

398
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,730
At least you only hear him.

399
00:23:59,170 --> 00:23:59,470
You know?

400
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,200
Poor Johnny.

401
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,920
His whole family lineage has bathroom issues.

402
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,700
I know.

403
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:08,980
Oh.

404
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,820
Just one flash.

405
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,730
Ciao time.

406
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,780
Go get my food, please.

407
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:45,300
depth perception sorry it's so loud I turned it up so he could hear him I felt like bless you snakes the reason he and his descendants have IBS I don't think it's our fault

408
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:59,960
heredity is IBS like a like is it a genetic thing is it a dominant gene Oh, chow time!

409
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,280
Please, sir, I want...

410
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,000
Please, sir, can I have some more?

411
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,760
Oh, fish this time!

412
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,340
Wow, feeding us good.

413
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,020
Oh, wait.

414
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,900
Johnny, hold on.

415
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,180
Wait, Johnny, one moment.

416
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,680
I didn't mean to...

417
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,050
Hold on.

418
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,360
There you go.

419
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,240
Keep being epic.

420
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,940
Thank you!

421
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,040
Thanks, man.

422

You're welcome.

423
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,900
Eat up.

424
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,060
You have anything to say to me?

425
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,080
Yes!

426
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,680
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all.

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,240

429
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,080

Actually, my name is Johnny too.

He's so cute.

435
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,920
All the firstborn sons in my family are called Johnny.

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,020
Johnny.

437
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,460

He will be.

00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,480
No, clan of Johnny's.

441
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,300

Come here.

450
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,880
Too far away.

451
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,560
Damn it.

452
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,920
Oh, wait.

453
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,080
Are you close enough now?

454
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,200
Are you close?

455
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,380
Are you close enough?

456
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,360
No?

457
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:09,960

Thank you, thank you!

460
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:20,840
Hey!

461
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,020
I'm doing all sorts of mischief in here.

462
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,220
Here we go, here we go.

463
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,760
Oh, hello.

464
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,280
What's all that noise?

465
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,140
What are you doing?

466
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:40,740
Nothing.

467
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,700
I'm having a smoke.

468
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,320
Come look in here.

469
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,440
Come look in here.

470
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

471
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,140
There we go.

472
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:47,740
There we go.

473
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,340
Wait, now.

474
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,220
Please, I don't want to waste all these.

475
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,800
There we go.

476
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Nice.

477
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
Wait, not the cure.

478
00:29:59,480 --> 00:29:59,820
My bad.

479
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,080
Shoot.

480
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,680
I can't remember how to just get to regular codec.

481
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,040
Why am I so stupid?

482
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,060
I don't remember how to open up the codec menu.

483
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,020
Wait, one second.

484
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,120
I don't remember what the...

485
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,620
Hmm.

486
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,240
Down D-pad.

487
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:28,620
I'm doing it.

488
00:30:28,640 --> 00:31:00,100

don't worry.

490
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,460
Back in England, we don't call stuff like that fine spirit.

491
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,460
We call it sulfuric acid.

492
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,560
Imagine, if you will, your internal organs being slowly eaten away as smoke pours out of your mouth.

493
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,380
Really, Snake, you shouldn't be touching that.

494
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,360
Was it a dream?

495
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,800
A dream?

496
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,160
Well, how nice.

497
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,960
And here I thought I sat up all night worrying about you for nothing.

498
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,800
It was almost real.

499
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,380
I was holding this sword in my hand.

500
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,540
Snake, are you okay?

501
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,620
You're not going loony.

00:31:28,640 --> 00:32:47,540

505
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,820
so there's this big pile of crap, right?

506
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:37,940
It's shaped like a giant tank and it's walking around on two legs going on a rampage and stopping on people and houses and stuff.

507
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,080
And this giant turd is carrying the nastiest missiles you ever saw.

508
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:50,920
Like whenever it launches one of its turd missiles, whatever it hits, people, trees, buildings, turns into crap.

509
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,980
Poopy gear solid.

510
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,120
My hometown, my old school, my family, my girlfriend, old man John.

511
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:54,860
everything in that turd's path turned into crap that's pretty sick man good thing was just a dream huh yes that's a good thing you feeling better now yeah good then let's get down to business you see snake people are just turd sacks and they're full of holes fill them up with water and it's got to come out from somewhere okay maybe that was a bad example what I'm trying to say is no matter what the situation there's always a way out don't throw in the towel yet clear your mind think it through assess the situation you'll find a way to escape got it don't let my nightmare come true right not the poopy gear solid no no please wrap it up a lot of folks suspected they could easily replace Guy Savage with something Castlevania.

512
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,160
But it's cool they brought Platinum just for that.

513
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,760
Yeah, right?

514
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
So good.

515
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,400
So good.

516
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,620
Oh, uh, uh, but, but, but, but.

517
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,380
Uh, tune.

518
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,020
Okay, one.

519
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:09,800
What?

520
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,660
144.

521
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
Got 7.5.

522
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:17,920
Was it?

523
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,260
I believe?

524
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,500
Okay.

525
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,200
The door has been unlocked.

526
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,160
This is one of my favorite Kodak combos in the entire series.

527
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:32,660
Oh.

528
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,940
Hello?

529
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,560
I forgot to ask James Mathis about it.

530
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:36,600
No!

531
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,740
Yeah, I'm out.

532
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,680
Be careful.

533
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,880
In your present state, you're practically naked.

534
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,340
Naked?

535
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,440
You don't have a single decent weapon, and you'll never survive in a battle.

536
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,620
Take some time and pull yourself together.

537
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,000
Okay.

538
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,500
Eva says she's recovered your equipment, so rendezvous with her as soon as possible.

539
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,660
to get your gear back.

540
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,540
Use the escape route Eva set up for you.

541
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,340
Go down into the sewers through the manhole in the northwest section of Krosnigrad.

542
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,440
Start out by exiting the holding cells and heading northwest.

543
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,980
There's dogs over there, you know.

544
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,620
What you got?

545
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,780
Johnny, anything for me?

546
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:12,980
Oops.

547
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,420
Smoke grenade.

548
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,080
That's very handy.

549
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,620
Anything in here?

550
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,200
No?

551
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,860
Wait, where is Agako?

552
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,160
I hear him.

553
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,500
How am I supposed to shoot him?

554
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,620
How am I supposed to get him, though?

555
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,780
Anything in there?

556
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,220
No?

557
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,210
What's this?

558
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,730
A camera.

559
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,090
Thargo, thanks for the thank you, dude!

560
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,610
Finger guns, yeah.

561
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,330
We'll just, uh...

562
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,310
Oh, there's a...

563
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,810
Oh, uh...

564
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,390
Wait.

565
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:54,890
Um...

566
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,870
Can I fork him?

567
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:56,790
I

568
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,660
can't get any closer.

569
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,400
No, the cult does not have any ammo.

570
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,220
Hmm.

571
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,060
It's just out of reach.

572
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,920
It's okay.

573
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,620
I've already missed so many that it's kind of like a...

574
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,500
Not a super huge deal if I...

575
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,500
Miss one, you know?

576
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,540
What's in here?

577
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,280
Wait.

578
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,380
Oh, Tamika.

579
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,800
Oh, whoa.

580
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,060
Wow.

581
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,060
Wee.

582
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,200
Sorry, the more I look, the more I'm wow.

583
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
Sorry.

584
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,880
I'm not sorry.

585
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,040
Damn.

586
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,120
Madame!

587
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:05,800
Okay.

588
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,300
That rod of yours.

589
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,000
This is the other door, right?

590
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,200
Or this goes into...

591
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,700
Oh wait.

592
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,600
Oh no, this is where it all happens.

593
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,660
Wait, is Gakko in there?

594
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,780
No?

595
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,780
Hmm.

596
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,680
Where could he be?

597
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,060
I hear him.

598
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,300
Wait, did I go in here?

599
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,200
Oh.

600
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,000
It would be really messed up if Gakko is in here.

601
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,640
That would be so horrible.

602
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,860
Oh, it's freaky in here.

603
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,140
Okay, we're still fine.

604
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,680
Okie dokie!

605
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,120
I have...

606
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,600
I have a bat I can eat.

607
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,840
I probably should have waited for some more food, maybe.

608
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,720
The fun room.

609
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,600
Well, we'll just eat some rats in the sewer, I guess, or something.

610
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,080
We'll just...

611
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,720
We'll just...

612
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,140
Alright.

613
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,960
I have to find...

614
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,380
I hear someone over there.

615
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,100
Oh my gosh.

616
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,860
We have to find...

617
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,340
Oh, are you kidding me?

618
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,560
No, there was nobody.

619
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,600
Already!

620
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,100
So evil.

621
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,760
Okay.

622
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,300
He doesn't know.

623
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,480
Best would be if Gakko was actually chained off.

624
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,180
That's freaky for real.

625
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,220
Oh my gosh.

626
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:44,920
I can't change.

627
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,240
I have no camo at all.

628
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:46,940
This sucks.

629
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,180
Okay, hold on.

630
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,700
Let's see.

631
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,940
Oh, wrong button.

632
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,160
This one.

633
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,960
Oh, does it show the little...

634
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,740
The little passageways?

635
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,460
It doesn't.

636
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,740
I don't remember where it is.

637
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,120
Literally just finished work and started watching this first thing I see is Vinto checking out the models.

638
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,540
Oh, too few!

639
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,480
Johnny drops ramen.

640
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,580
Really?

641
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,700
He's got ramen on him?

642
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,180
And he was holding out on us?

643
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,860
Wait, is he awake?

644
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,480
Nothing?

645
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,060
Never mind.

646
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,300
We're not dealing with...

647
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,980
It's fine.

648
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,840
We don't need it.

649
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,320
We'll get it back.

650
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,600
Oh, gosh.

651
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,340
All right.

652
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,990
They can probably see my breath home.

653
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:47,790
Oh, gosh.

654
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,830
Oh, there we go.

655
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,930
Okay, that guy.

656
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:54,590
Let's see.

657
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,530
What do you do?

658
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,970
What are you doing over there, huh, buddy?

659
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,250
Can you kind of stay still for a bit?

660
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,530
I think there's a hole over there.

661
00:41:09,470 --> 00:42:04,700

Are you gonna wiggle wiggle for me again?

664
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,610
That's what I thought.

665
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,350
Oh shoot!

666
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,710
I'm an idiot.

667
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,710
Let's just go this way.

668
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,370
Are they accidentally let go?

669
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,090
Where's the hole?

670
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:23,930
I found it.

671
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:24,950
Okay, we're fine now.

672
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,160
Okay, now we can eat.

673
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,220
Come here, little rat.

674
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,140
Where are you?

675
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,230
Let's actually...

676
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:47,510
Oh.

677
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,110
Oh.

678
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,610
Oh, I was gonna say, yeah, I do have a gunshot wound.

679
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

680
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:51,830
Okay.

681
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,170
Oh, yeah, I gotta get them.

682
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,350
I'm bleeding.

683
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:58,870
I'm bleeding.

684
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:01,470
Oh, bandage.

685
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:01,670
Okay.

686
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:02,870
Okay, good.

687
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,250
This might actually be your biggest flub yet.

688
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,370
I was so good.

689
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,250
I'm going the wrong way, aren't I?

690
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,950
Come here.

691
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,570
Come here, little rat.

692
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:13,090
Come here.

693
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:22,870
Come here.

694
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,670
Come here.

695
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,770
Okay.

696
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:24,990
Tasty.

697
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:30,050
Definitely.

698
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,780
I definitely screwed that up.

699
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,820
I take full responsibility.

700
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,840
I really messed that up pretty bad.

701
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,140
Come in HQ.

702
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,980
This is HQ.

703
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:44,900
Control here.

704
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,600
I wonder where Gakko is.

705
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,520
I knew that Kedotan was down here, but...

706
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,620
Where am I?

707
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,340
Yeah, I'm so far.

708
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,520
Oh, gosh.

709
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:02,820
Um...

710
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,300
Might be easier to go back to the other area.

711
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,880
I don't know, actually.

712
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,860
Can't tell which would be faster.

713
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:15,940
Kedot, Kedot.

714
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,300
Yeah, it might be easier to just go to this area.

715
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,160
There was another door, maybe it would go through the other way.

716
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,640
Oh, how did I miss that up so badly?

717
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,820
It's on this side?

718
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,400
Nothing here?

719
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,470
Uh, I'm here, little rant.

720
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:53,890
I'm gonna consume you.

721
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,470
No one see?

722
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:01,610
Okay, no one hears me chomping in the sewers.

723
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,190
Actually, what is this?

724
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,110
It's not really sewers.

725
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,190
It's just...

726
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:07,610
Okay, we're back where we started.

727
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,920
I don't want to kill anybody, but...

728
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,240
Zero progress.

729
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,520
Could you...

730
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,300
I wish my friend L.

731
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:28,880
Happy birthday!

732
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:29,960
L!

733
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,100
Happy birthday!

734
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,220
Happy, happy birthday!

735
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,380
There should be a turn.

736
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:41,800
Where?

737
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:47,720
Nope.

738
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,020
Yeah, let me see, hold on.

739
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,240
That door down there will try and go through.

740
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,020
And then we'll go through down there.

741
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,440
Well, we're going through like extra areas.

742
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,020
Might just be better to brute force it, I wonder.

743
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,480
If I just run...

744
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:10,540
Like, what?

745
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,340
Stealth?

746
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:14,940
Stealth?

747
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,680
We don't need it!

748
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,200
Yeah, we're back to where we held the dude up originally.

749
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,480
If I just run...

750
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,000
This isn't a stealth game.

751
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:29,720
Yeah, exactly.

752
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,280
Stealth is so optional.

753
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,420
I wish I could see No one's here

754
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,040
I hear walking like Oh my god he's right there

755
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,520
He is very close

756
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:06,570
Oh dang I was gonna say I'm cheating I was gonna use the camera mode to

757
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:21,470
You can leave now sir You can leave You can leave Let's play Super Robot Wars and you can have borderline, come on.

758
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,130
Reminded me of our ghost made.

759
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:23,810
Appreciate you.

760
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,010
I just thank you.

761
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,590
Thank you, thank you.

762
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:28,090
Okay.

763
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,190
I can't tell if he's gone or not.

764
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:31,670
I'm listening.

765
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:34,910
He's HQ.

766
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:35,690
He's HQ.

767
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,230
This is HQ.

768
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,210
He's like right there.

769
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:39,270
Control here.

770
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:41,730
No problems detected.

771
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:43,130
Understood.

772
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,290
Return to your position.

773
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,390
Oh my god!

774
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:57,350
Footsteps.

775
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,590
No, no, that's not exactly, that's not at all what you heard.

776
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,070
Footsteps.

777
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,210
Don't do it.

778
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,010
Don't do it.

779
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,310
I'm gonna eat your legs.

780
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,970
I'm gonna eat your legs.

781
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,570
Yeah, nobody here, dummy.

782
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,330
Oh my god.

783
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,790
I'm gonna eat it.

784
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:27,310
I'm gonna chow down.

785
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,310
I don't think I wouldn't do it!

786
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,310
I don't want to kill anybody.

787
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,770
I wish this guy would just leave!

788
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,940
I can't hear anymore.

789
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,610
Climb, climb, climb, climb, please.

790
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:10,590
The door was, uh...

791
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,960
I guess there's somebody over here.

792
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,180
Is there?

793
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:26,740
Is there?

794
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,640
Maybe not?

795
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,180
Did I hear kiddo kiddo?

796
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,100
Huh, okay.

797
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,640
What was I hearing then?

798
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,340
We crawl?

799
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,620
Okay.

800
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,040
We crawl?

801
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,320
Oh my god.

802
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,950
Yeah, you heard someone walking too, right?

803
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,170
Yeah, yeah.

804
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:16,650
Keep going?

805
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:18,910
Keep going?

806
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,130
Don't stop going.

807
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:26,310
I will also keep going and don't stop going.

808
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:28,750
Bite his boots.

809
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,270
I'm gonna bite him by the booties.

810
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:32,810
I am going the right way, right?

811
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:34,670
Oh, I always press the wrong button.

812
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,410
Yeah, we're gonna go through...

813
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,810
We'll go to the...

814
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,510
We'll go through whichever one we can make it to.

815
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:49,510
Seems like a supreme design oversight to have all these man-sized vents over all of them.

816
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:50,270
No.

817
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:51,290
What?

818
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:52,630
No.

819
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,050
In fact, it's better for the whole team.

820
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,410
What's this?

821
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,290
Disinfecting the bandage.

822
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:03,910
Okay.

823
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:07,970
Oh no.

824
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,110
I'm like barely even over there.

825
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:12,410
Okay

826
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,400
Oh Oh shit.

827
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,960
Oh we're running Ouch we're running snake we're not stopping we're running.

828
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:56,880
We're running and we're flipping we're flipping around Yep Okay, we're running I didn't see anyone did you guys we're running We're running We're running.

829
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:57,800
We're running.

830
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,200
I know exactly where to go.

831
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,100
Don't release the dog.

832
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:00,940
Damn it!

833
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,760
We're fine.

834
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,520
Just keep going, Snake!

835
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,420
Just keep going, Snake!

836
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,760
We got that!

837
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,900
That was so easy!

838
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,760
Don't ignore the alarms going on up there.

839
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,960
Snake, you're already in the sewers.

840
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,980
Eva, yeah, I just got down here.

841
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,320
I'm coming to meet you now.

842
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,320
The door at the north end is open, right?

843
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:44,760
Right?

844
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,480
Ah, Snake?

845
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,000
What?

846
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,000
Let me guess.

847
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,160
There's a problem.

848
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,120
Yeah.

849
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,980
What is it this time?

850
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,080
The Colonel found out you escaped.

851
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,420
Oh, I wonder how.

852
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,900
I figured as much.

853
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,760
Yeah, and now all of Grozny Grad is on red alert.

854
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,380
What?

855
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,540
Just my luck.

856
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,960
But once I'm out of the fortress...

857
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,400
You can't get out.

858
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,480
I can't.

859
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:37,500
When the fortress went on red alert, alert they sealed off the sewers how did they know i'm serious no that means the escape route i laid out is sealed off too so unlucky they just sent a unit out looking it wasn't my fault they discovered i was gone they'll be there any minute now you've got to get out quick oh gosh i hate this part i like this part but i hate it at the same time i should be able to get out by heading straight north book it snake if they find you you're dead okay one moment one moment i have some in me,

860
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,120
I believe.

861
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:42,580
Um.

862
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,500
Time to wander through the sewers with all these open wounds.

863
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,660
You almost made her cry from having this.

864
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,340
Stop.

865
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,400
What the heck?

866
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,520
I didn't even do anything.

867
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,800
This part is not my favorite.

868
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,040
Oh.

869
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,280
But we shall endure.

870
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,000
Not my favorite.

871
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,720
Many dogs.

872
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,650
But it also has one of my favorite cutscenes.

873
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:31,290
So you know what?

874
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:32,410
I will forgive.

875
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:34,790
Menu.

876
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:36,150
Oh, my food?

877
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,030
Maybe I will eat.

878
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,670
I only have as a bat.

879
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,490
Nah, well, thank you so much for another 20.

880
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:47,270
Thank you!

881
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:51,650
I remember this part, but I don't remember the staircase.

882
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,070
You know, I don't...

883
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,330
I feel like I remember the staircase.

884
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:56,570
I'm not sure, actually.

885
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,090
Okay.

886
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,170
We gotta, like, crawl...

887
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:06,570
Oh, wait.

888
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:07,730
Here's some food.

889
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,590
Lucky.

890
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:12,210
Lucky.

891
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:14,770
Delicious?

892
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:15,890
Nutritious?

893
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,790
Froggy?

894
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:20,510
Wait, what's over there?

895
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,430
We're crawling once again.

896
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,050
Oh, we can't see anything.

897
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:28,770
Oh my gosh.

898
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,370
Wait, I actually can't see anything.

899
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,310
Is it just a hiding spot?

900
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:44,150
Wait.

901
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,130
Yes, it is.

902
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,090
Okay, just kidding.

903
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:56,610
Um.

904
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,760
I don't want to get attacked by the dogs.

905
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,480
Some rats to eat.

906
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,820
More food.

907
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,720
More food.

908
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,000
Come here, food.

909
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,380
Come here, food.

910
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:16,600
Come here, food.

911
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:17,800
Mike?

912
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:20,880
Dogs?

913
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,380
When did they come out?

914
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:23,720
I don't remember.

915
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,320
Oh, it's this part.

916
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:25,680
Oh.

917
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,380
That's a dog.

918
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:36,810
Wonder if...

919
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,150
Maybe the grenades would be good.

920
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,430
I only have five of them, though.

921
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:44,050
Oh.

922
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,070
Uh-oh.

923
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,590
Don't notice me.

924
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:48,990
Please don't notice me.

925
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:50,770
Please don't notice me.

926
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:53,550
Please don't notice me.

927
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,500
I think I have to go over to that side.

928
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,900
I don't quite remember.

929
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,260
I think I can go in here.

930
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,140
Wait.

931
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:12,660
Dog?

932
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,980
Behind me?

933
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,560
Oh my god, there's a dog!

934
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,640
Oh my god!

935
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,060
Where was it that way?

936
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,080
Oh my gosh, I can't remember.

937
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:28,700
It's fine, we have a mat.

938
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,920
Can't remember.

939
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:34,920
Fork the dog.

940
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:35,580
Can I?

941
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,160
Oh no, not this one.

942
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,370
Well, we got some stuff here.

943
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,670
And another dog.

944
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:48,910
Oh wait, that's ammo.

945
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:50,010
Wait, this is...

946
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,650
How did you get over here?

947
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:54,170
Good.

948
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,370
Dogs can crawl.

949
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:10,570
Oh shoot.

950
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,030
I was wrong again?

951
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:12,790
Oh my god.

952
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:18,490
Now I'm swimming in open wounds.

953
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:19,370
Delicious.

954
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:27,010
Okay.

955
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:27,750
Over here.

956
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,450
It's gotta be.

957
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:31,030
No!

958
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:39,850
We're running.

959
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:40,850
No!

960
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:41,830
Don't do it.

961
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,650
Don't do it, dog.

962
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:43,570
Don't do it.

963
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,710
Oh wait.

964
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:45,810
I hear what?

965
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:46,430
I think.

966
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,110
Oh gosh.

967
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:49,470
We're running!

968
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:51,130
We're running!

969
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:52,670
We're running!

970
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:58,110
We're running!

971
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:58,370
We're running!

972
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,610
Queue the epic music.

973
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:13,550
Wait.

974
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:15,950
Wait.

975
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,550
I haven't seen him in so long.

976
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:18,910
Wait.

977
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,670
I love this part, though.

978
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,070
This part's so good.

979
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,390
He's waited for this moment.

980
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,070
That guy's pretty beat up, huh?

981
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:51,880
Okay, cool.

982
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,640
Finally.

983
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,080
I've been waiting for this.

984
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:58,620
Yeah!

985
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,200
Nobody interfere.

986
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,560
It's so good It's so good

987
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,080
This is where it ends

988
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:40,370
One Yeah

989
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,920
Oh my god Just stupid face here

990
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:14,780
Just barely Just barely Nearly a sk- Everyone's just like, if we had been able to interfere...

991
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,620
Don't die on me yet.

992
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,830
It's so good.

993
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,150
Oh!

994
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:42,050
The final Cobra unit member, let's call it.

995
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,190
I've been waiting for this.

996
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,490
My river is clean!

997
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,790
It'll be full of rats and fish!

998
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:56,770
Probably.

999
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:00,150
There should be no people in here!

1000
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,480
There should be no people!

1001
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,680
Oh my gosh.

1002
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,040
Turn it up, baby.

1003
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:12,780
Turn it up.

1004
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,080
You're

1005
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:19,370
one of the Cobras.

1006
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:31,910
sad so sad a host of sorrows

1007
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:41,210
and you are one of them

1008
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:58,050
oh he looks so cool I am the sorrow like you I too am filled with sadness This world is one of sadness.

1009
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:01,590
Battle brings death.

1010
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:04,150
Death brings sorrow.

1011
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:05,130
I haven't killed.

1012
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,130
I've feasted upon frogs.

1013
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:09,170
And bunnies.

1014
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:11,350
Their voices.

1015
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:12,910
Oh, you look so good.

1016
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,950
They fall upon deaf ears.

1017
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:18,970
But make no mistake.

1018
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:25,010
The dead are not silent.

1019
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:32,190
Now you will know the sorrow of those whose lives you have ended.

1020
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:39,970
So cool.

1021
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:41,270
So cool.

1022
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,870
So cool.

1023
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:49,390
Alright, let's see how many fish are in here.

1024
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:53,970
Two?

1025
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,930
There's so many fish!

1026
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,370
Look how cool, look at the way he moves.

1027
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,450
Hey, hey, I didn't kill that guy, he exploded.

1028
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:10,610
It's not my fault.

1029
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:14,770
It's not my fault he exploded.

1030
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:16,350
Brace yourself.

1031
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:18,930
Oh.

1032
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:19,990
Ah!

1033
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:22,990
Ah!

1034
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:23,970
Ah!

1035
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:27,230
How do I dodge it?

1036
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,510
So stinking loud.

1037
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:36,610
Get out of here, pain.

1038
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:37,770
No!

1039
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:38,410
Don't get at me!

1040
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:38,830
Don't get me!

1041
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:39,690
Don't grab me!

1042
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,250
Maybe I have to dive to dodge it.

1043
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:45,390
Yeah.

1044
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:48,090
So cool.

1045
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:50,690
Music is so good.

1046
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:54,290
There we go.

1047
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:55,430
Okay.

1048
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,230
So it's the same as before.

1049
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,150
Oh my gosh, I'm so bad at this.

1050
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:05,730
It's hard, it's easier to tell in the original.

1051
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:09,410
It's like a little swirly thing, but this time it's kind of difficult.

1052
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:11,490
Maybe I'm stupid.

1053
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,690
No, don't go after me.

1054
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:18,210
No, don't go after me.

1055
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,460
It's way more transparent.

1056
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1057
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,200
Yeah, in this one it is.

1058
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:30,080
Yeah.

1059
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:34,730
I'll just keep the one side.

1060
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:42,730
I mean...

1061
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:47,550
Look at all these fish!

1062
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:52,230
I should have killed some people, so we had some guys in my...

1063
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:53,770
Not the bird!

1064
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:59,330
I'm sorry, I got my stuff taken away!

1065
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,630
I didn't get to feed you in the cage!

1066
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:23,270
I'm kind of sad I don't have any guys now Whoa Oh you can't you can't That's kind of weird Oh my gosh Whoa what was that Who was that There was someone standing behind me

1067
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:38,850
No it wasn't the fury behind me Uh oh I'm gonna get gots up So sorry, you guys.

1068
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,530
So sorry, I'm really bad at dodging that for some reason.

1069
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,850
There was somebody standing behind me.

1070
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:55,310
Ugh.

1071
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:57,550
It's all fish.

1072
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,990
They didn't even include like any of the other animals that I've eaten.

1073
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,280
They actually didn't.

1074
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,440
It's only fish.

1075
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,960
There's like no...

1076
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,780
There's nothing else in here.

1077
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,000
Oh, you can really see his body so clearly.

1078
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,500
That's cool.

1079
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,180
That's cool.

1080
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,560
It is time for you to wake up.

1081
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,420
Okay, before we do that.

1082
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,780
Snake, you have to get up.

1083
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:34,960
Snake!

1084
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,060
Snake!

1085
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,180
Snake, what happened?

1086
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:44,920
Snake!

1087
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,020
Snake!

1088
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,620
Snake, don't quit on me now.

1089
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:53,800
Snake!

1090
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,680
I went through this boss battle not too long ago and had the same issue as well.

1091
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,160
They made his aim with the beam much more precise.

1092
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,380
Ah, I see, I see.

1093
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:05,380
Snake!

1094
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:06,660
What happened to you?

1095
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:07,860
Snake?

1096
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:09,260
Snake!

1097
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:10,260
Snake!

1098
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,360
Doesn't paramedic like cry?

1099
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:16,140
Snake, are you okay?

1100
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:17,720
Snake!

1101
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,160
Snake!

1102
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,420
You know about the camera thing in this fight, right?

1103
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:27,830
I don't know.

1104
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,310
Actually, I don't think I remember.

1105
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:32,930
What is the camera thing?

1106
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:34,970
Snake, what happened?

1107
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:35,870
Talk to me!

1108
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:37,150

1109
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:38,030
Snake!

1110
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:39,610
I don't think I know.

1111
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:44,250
I was like, if I do know, I don't remember.

1112
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:45,270

Can I see them?

1117
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:23,480
Normally?

1118
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,480
I don't want to die.

1119
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,740
I'm just trying to keep that in mind.

1120
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:33,190
I will!

1121
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,110
Hold on!

1122
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:34,570
Gosh.

1123
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:36,130
Oh, I see!

1124
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:37,210
I can see!

1125
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:38,350
I see someone there!

1126
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:39,650
Oh my gosh!

1127
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:41,490
Wait!

1128
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:45,290
Oh, I see!

1129
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,450
I see someone else!

1130
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:47,590
I see someone else!

1131
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:54,570
Uh...

1132
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:55,970
No one here.

1133
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:59,450
No one here?

1134
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:03,530
You do not belong here.

1135
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:04,570
I do, actually.

1136
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:05,210
Ah!

1137
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:05,930
In the corner!

1138
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,630
The left bottom left corner!

1139
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:08,310
You see him?

1140
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,830
He's so smiley.

1141
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,880
Oh my god!

1142
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:25,020
Oh wait.

1143
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,120
Uh...

1144
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,340
I don't see anyone here.

1145
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,320
I don't see anyone here.

1146
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,980
It is time for you to...

1147
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,900
Hold on, I'm having fun.

1148
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,160
Ah!

1149
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,780
The ghost photos are the OG version.

1150
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,480
I don't...

1151
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,640
I can't believe I never knew this.

1152
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,280
Unless...

1153
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,540
Maybe I was told, but I never did it myself.

1154
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,340
Chica, thanks for the gifted.

1155
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:00,360
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

1156
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:00,660
Oh!

1157
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:02,740
I'm sorry, I didn't see who raided me.

1158
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,900
Thank you so much.

1159
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,700
Thank you, thank you.

1160
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,480
D'Orgo, thank you so much for the five gifted.

1161
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:07,980
Thank you.

1162
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,100
We're on the final Cobra fight.

1163
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:14,460
Look at all them fish.

1164
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,080
I love fish.

1165
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,920
Getting all them amino acids, baby.

1166
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,140
Hold on.

1167
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,040
You're not my mom.

1168
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,000
What is it?

1169
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,680
Time for school?

1170
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,620
I'm doing ghost photography.

1171
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,060
My, my fan.

1172
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1173
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:40,480
Ah, I see somebody in the middle, bottom, bottom, middle.

1174
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,240
Okay, okay, okay, we do it, we do it.

1175
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,380
Okay, how do I get...

1176
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,560
Oh, there we go.

1177
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,520
All right, so let's see.

1178
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:58,240
We need this.

1179
01:12:59,420 --> 01:12:59,600
Wait.

1180
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,600
Where is it?

1181
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,900
Wait, is it, uh...

1182
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,240
Wait, I can't remember how to...

1183
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,640
I always forget how to do this.

1184
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,380
Wait, huh?

1185
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,380
Wait, I do have all my stuff.

1186
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:21,920
Why?

1187
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:22,560
Wait.

1188
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,500
Why do I have all my stuff?

1189
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,160
That's weird.

1190
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:31,740
Oh, the dead body?

1191
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:33,560
Come here.

1192
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,460
Go to the body.

1193
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,800
Come here.

1194
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,300
Come here.

1195
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:38,660
Come here.

1196
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:39,860
Come here.

1197
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:40,320
Come here.

1198
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,300
Aw, it shows her.

1199
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:48,120
Oh, oops.

1200
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,480
Wait, I forgot to...

1201
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:50,520
Oh,

1202
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:54,060
I forgot to...

1203
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:54,560
Oh, I forgot to...

1204
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,380
Oh, no, I pressed continue.

1205
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,660
Oh my gosh, I'm so stupid.

1206
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,380
Oh my gosh.

1207
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,740
You guys, I'm so dumb.

1208
01:13:59,320 --> 01:13:59,760
I press...

1209
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,980
I did it all wrong.

1210
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:13,370
I always fluff this part.

1211
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,110
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:14,970
I get so excited.

1213
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,070
I just forget everything.

1214
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:17,110
Wait, what's that?

1215
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:18,650
That's a skull.

1216
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:19,830
I didn't do that.

1217
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:22,850
I do like it.

1218
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:24,950
Oh, please, please, please.

1219
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:26,970
Oh, geez, okay.

1220
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,470
Oops, all fish.

1221
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:32,970
I like how he though it says back again.

1222
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:33,610
It's cool.

1223
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:37,010
It's fun.

1224
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:41,190
I do this every time though.

1225
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:42,570
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1226
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:44,450
Stop taking my life wars.

1227
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:50,430
You know, this is what I do to you guys every time you watch my streams and stuff.

1228
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,660
Kind of like Sorrow, he's just a ghost dude.

1229
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:04,660
Nice.

1230
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:09,480
Way through water.

1231
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,320
No, see when they're taking the life force.

1232
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:14,820
I do that.

1233
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,380
See, watch, watch.

1234
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,460
Snake will glow.

1235
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,280
Oh my gosh, we're gonna get God again.

1236
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:19,720
Oh!

1237
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:21,720
I'm so sorry.

1238
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,020
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1239
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,760
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1240
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:32,700
Please no!

1241
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,400
Oh, thank goodness.

1242
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:35,980
It's so loud.

1243
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,900
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

1244
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:40,880
Thank you!

1245
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:48,180
One is liquid, one is solid, you are a big boss.

1246
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:50,920
Look at all them!

1247
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:51,940
Fish!

1248
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,100
Grandpa!

1249
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:56,880
Grandpa!

1250
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,500
Grandpa!

1251
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:02,740
Grandpa!

1252
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:07,770
Look at he's like swimming after me.

1253
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:10,040
Grandpa!

1254
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:10,980
Grandpa!

1255
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:13,100
Thank you.

1256
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:19,430
Oh, I love this part.

1257
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:20,190
I can't wait.

1258
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:24,330
I was watching the remake trailer for Fatal Frame.

1259
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:45,090
My one thing about it is I'm kind of worried that it's a little like okay So one thing I love about the older fatal brain games and what makes them work so well is they're extremely grainy And like it makes the ghost photography sometimes it looks like super legit,

1260
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:58,110
you know Like the photos look super duper scary sometimes like they look almost real And...

1261
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:00,090
And...

1262
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:03,450
I just worry that...

1263
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:06,130
Um...

1264
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:06,470
Okay.

1265
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:07,530
Alright.

1266
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:10,410
We'll use this once we touch the bag.

1267
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:13,650
Don't worry that it looks too clean, the remake.

1268
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:16,090
But we'll see.

1269
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,640
There we go.

1270
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:42,830
Die!

1271
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:43,570
Just kidding.

1272
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,870
Oh no, he died!

1273
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,470
Just kidding.

1274
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:49,810
You have to shoot me.

1275
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,630
I can't.

1276
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:52,510
Shoot me.

1277
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,410
You want to finish your mission, don't you?

1278
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:57,890
Then...

1279
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:59,750
you'll have to shoot me.

1280
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,770
The spirit of the warrior...

1281
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:05,970
will always be with you.

1282
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,370
Don't be sad.

1283
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:12,010
We'll meet...

1284
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:12,490
again someday.

1285
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:14,830
No!

1286
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:29,570
Come on, Snake!

1287
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,650
Oh, it's so...

1288
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:45,650
Whoa, whoa, the camera was so crazy looking.

1289
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,230
Whoa, I wonder if that showed up well on YouTube.

1290
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:49,670
Woof.

1291
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,900
Too much water.

1292
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:01,640
Four was okay.

1293
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,580
The problem with Five is you ended up feeling more aroused than scared.

1294
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:11,020
Five has one of my favorite visuals in the whole series though.

1295
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:16,020
Where like Fuyuhi is like standing behind you.

1296
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,340
It's towards the beginning of the game.

1297
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,500
I love it.

1298
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:21,240
And she's just kind of like her neck is all like...

1299
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:24,200
Oh, here we go.

1300
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,100
I don't know why it said mouse button.

1301
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,360
It confused me for a second.

1302
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:37,220
But Fatal Frame is so sexy and so scary at the same time.

1303
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,880
See his victory against the sorrow.

1304
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,140
The fear boner.

1305
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:46,080
Don't say that.

1306
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,880
So that really was.

1307
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:49,500
Something on your mind, Snake?

1308
01:19:50,180 --> 01:20:54,100
Major, was there a man in the Cobra unit the sorrow yes I've heard of him he was an uncanny soldier who fought alongside the boss what kind of man was he the sorrow was a man with well special powers he had a SP which was a subject of extensive research in the Soviet Union at the time he was especially gifted as a medium a medium someone who can communicate with the spirit world you think he could talk to me in other words he could talk to ghosts they say he could find out what was going on in a battle by talking to dead soldiers what about him and the boss what was the sorrow between them I don't know this message the snake for me why don't we ask Sigind yo I finished checking up on this sorrow guy a while ago thought you guys already knew though knew what that he's dead he's been dead for two years now he died two years ago at Salino Yarsk you know those clips you were at mm-hmm and the boss is the one who did him in we saw his body yep two years ago the was sent by the CIA on a

1309
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,720
secret mission to Salino Yarsk.

1310
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:01,600
That's when she met the Sorrow, who'd gone back to the Soviet Union after the Cobras broke up at the end of the war.

1311
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,920
Except this time they were enemies.

1312
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,160
And then what?

1313
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:08,840
The boss killed the Sorrow herself and accomplished her mission.

1314
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,360
At least, that's what the records say.

1315
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:14,540
So, he was never there in the first place.

1316
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,820
He just couldn't let go of the boss.

1317
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:17,980
You okay, Snake?

1318
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,920
Yeah, I'm fine.

1319
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,600
It looks like it's not time for me to die.

1320
01:21:22,720 --> 01:22:17,640
I sure hope not otherwise the whole mission is shot we're counting on you pal Roger that don't you care about my life Eva obviously he doesn't you didn't call I was worried are you alright yeah I took a pretty freaky detour what are you talking about yeah nothing forget it yeah I love that line good but how did you escape from the sewers I jumped into the river from all the way up there you're out of control yeah I got carried away by the current and almost drowned great that's perfect what do you mean that's perfect I mean if you ended up in the river then I know a good spot nearby let's meet up there okay where is it keep going upstream until you get to a waterfall okay a waterfall huh right behind that waterfall there's a cave we'll meet in there okay the cave behind the Waterfall upstream.

1321
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:18,820
Got it.

1322
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,280
Got it.

1323
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:19,980
See you there.

1324
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:26,320
Unfortunately, they're already going to be on caution because I have the tracker in me.

1325
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,440
But that's okay.

1326
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,760
Wait, actually, which way do I go?

1327
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,040
Okay, I'm faced downstream.

1328
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,480
We need to go upstream.

1329
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,160
Yeah, it's definitely worth it.

1330
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,780
Do we want to kill now?

1331
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:52,700
Just finish the...

1332
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,540
Or just watch the fantastic reality mod.

1333
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:57,000
Last time I was teared up a little bit watching you perform.

1334
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,820
Joshua, thank you!

1335
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:01,240
Thank you.

1336
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:07,300
I could kill.

1337
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,620
I don't care.

1338
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,140
What the heck are those?

1339
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,320
Those things right there.

1340
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,220
Um, wait, hold on.

1341
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:17,960
I'm all lost.

1342
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:18,780
I'm all turned around.

1343
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:19,800
Okay, we go this way.

1344
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:26,070
Why did I go this way?

1345
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:27,830
I don't think so.

1346
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:29,310
Why am I so lost?

1347
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:33,470
Why am I so lost?

1348
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:35,730
Those are the mangoes?

1349
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:38,570
Where do I go up?

1350
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:54,850
I'm so lost.

1351
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:57,170
Where do I go?

1352
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:01,290
I can't, I don't recognize anything.

1353
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,470
Go, go, go.

1354
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:05,710
Eh?

1355
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:06,810
Eh?

1356
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,670
Wait.

1357
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:15,130
Hello, get it done.

1358
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,010
There we go.

1359
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:20,310
Okay, sorry.

1360
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:21,630
Sorry about that.

1361
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,130
Oh my gosh, you guys, I've been a little out of it today.

1362
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:24,950
I'll be honest.

1363
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:29,550
Oh.

1364
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:29,870
Oh.

1365
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:30,110
Oh.

1366
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:31,390
Oh.

1367
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:39,650
You ever like feel like, okay, like you are don't belong in your own skin.

1368
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,310
That's how I've been feeling today.

1369
01:24:43,130 --> 01:24:44,490
I don't ever feel like that.

1370
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:46,090
It's a very bizarre feeling.

1371
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:51,610
Like, I just wanted to, like, you know, tear off my skin today.

1372
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:56,210
I don't really know how else to describe it.

1373
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:36,260
way right yes I mean like it's not so much a problem for me I just have the ectoplasm you know but I think I just didn't sleep well oh my gosh you're on high alert you see that guy over there they're gonna I could just wait I can't Go into the waterfall if it's in alert mode,

1374
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:36,740
I think.

1375
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,240
So I'm going to have to be careful.

1376
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:41,800
We might need to kill.

1377
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:47,430
Did you possess the wrong person?

1378
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:48,250
Oh, maybe.

1379
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:49,690
Right.

1380
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:50,650
Maybe, maybe.

1381
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,620
Can you remove the tracker?

1382
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:57,960
You can.

1383
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:03,300
But there is a funny cutscene that I want to get.

1384
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:08,190
It's a funny cutscene.

1385
01:26:08,970 --> 01:27:10,150
it's really worth it I promise whoa whoa I didn't know this was here oh wow okay it's like my favorite track in the whole game because it reminds me of him I forgot that guy was up there but I'm too good maybe a little bit actually we'll have our gun out just so we can hold people up maybe if I can I'm not stupid nothing no one nowhere nothing no one nothing yeah you're seeing things exactly oh shoot how do I get past that guy I guess I could just maybe if I hug the wall oh shit we're going we're running the waterfalls are at the Can we go in?

1386
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:11,030
Oh, that is...

1387
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,130
Ah!

1388
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:14,910
Shoot!

1389
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:15,330
Ah!

1390
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:15,930
Ah!

1391
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:16,930
Why am I on the ground?

1392
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:17,550
Dive!

1393
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:33,910
Easy.

1394
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:51,660
Oh, God is it here.

1395
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,720
Don't worry about it.

1396
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,560
Eva will patch us all up.

1397
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,520
Freaking batch.

1398
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,300
Ah!

1399
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,380
Raw, man.

1400
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,620
And that thing she's been using.

1401
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,180
Oh boy, guys.

1402
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:17,140
Nice

1403
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,460
to meet you, Snake.

1404
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,080
I'm Tatiana.

1405
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:43,780
Thanks.

1406
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:48,580
Smile.

1407
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,880
Here's your equipment.

1408
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,200
Yippee!

1409
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:53,560
We're free.

1410
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,180
You could use a towel.

1411
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,640
So could you.

1412
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:00,440
Yeah, I could use a lot of help, actually.

1413
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,220
Ah, nice.

1414
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,840
He's chowing down.

1415
01:29:23,710 --> 01:29:24,330
Booty.

1416
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:31,330
Oh!

1417
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:32,730
Want some?

1418
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:33,750
No, thanks.

1419
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:36,190
Toes?

1420
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:38,390
Don't like snakes?

1421
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:40,230
Not for dinner.

1422
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:41,810
Hmm.

1423
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:44,670
Didn't you have to eat them at the KGB?

1424
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:47,550
In my training, we always have the good stuff.

1425
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,690
French, Italian.

1426
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:50,650
That kind of thing.

1427
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,030
A regular Matahari.

1428
01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:55,510
The least you could do is call me Cynthia.

1429
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:57,850
Cynthia Harrow.

1430
01:29:58,270 --> 01:29:58,930
Tell me something.

1431
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,430
How does it feel to spy on your own country?

1432
01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:07,070
I can't say it feels good, but it's my job.

1433
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:11,030
Can't even eat a snake during a mission, huh?

1434
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:12,970
There's fish.

1435
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:14,350
I wouldn't mind eating you.

1436
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,980
When this mission's over, you'll have to treat me to a nice dinner.

1437
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:30,720
What do you want to eat?

1438
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:32,740
Sushi!

1439
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:35,280
Yami!

1440
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:35,980
Sushi!

1441
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:36,640
It's Japanese.

1442
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,660
I hear it's all the rage right now.

1443
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,980
Supposedly it's made from raw fish.

1444
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:43,640
Raw fish.

1445
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:44,800
Women are confusing.

1446
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:46,220
Just a place for my survival techniques.

1447
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:50,120
She won't eat raw fish here, but she'll eat raw fish at the sushi restaurant.

1448
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:51,960
Women are strange.

1449
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:04,280
Snake.

1450
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:07,440
Thank you, Snake.

1451
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:18,860
your eyes from now on I'm searching and I'll melt into you

1452
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:35,310
what a fear in my heart but you're so supreme that still hurts that's fresh Eva my

1453
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:47,340
man is not reciprocating at all are

1454
01:31:50,720 --> 01:32:01,000
you all right it's not like I can't see I've got one good eye and can still fire a gun.

1455
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:02,920
Good.

1456
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:05,600
Yeah, good.

1457
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:09,560
Snake.

1458
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:10,780
Oh, here we go.

1459
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:11,720
Come here for a minute.

1460
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:14,160
This is what we left the tracker in for, everybody.

1461
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:15,880
What is the whole thing?

1462
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,100
There's something in here.

1463
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,000
It's so hard.

1464
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:20,440
Oh.

1465
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,140
When did it get like that?

1466
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,220
Hold still.

1467
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:29,460
Let me do it.

1468
01:32:31,300 --> 01:33:09,530
You know, I've been trained to do this kind of thing myself just relax and let me handle it the cheering gets me every time it is yeah but it gets the job done really here lift up your hips like this yeah pretty good at that yeah everybody tells me that hold steady I'm not done yet there a transmitter Is that how they do it in the KGB?

1469
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:10,670
Sometimes.

1470
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:12,890
Would you rather I did it American style?

1471
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:19,270
But how do you know there was a transmitter lodge there?

1472
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:22,390
That's some female intuition you've got.

1473
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:25,210
Them, like, spinning around holding hands is so cute.

1474
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:29,990
Yeah, I wonder what American style is.

1475
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:33,870
Yay!

1476
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:36,430
We got our clothes back on!

1477
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:39,890
Eva, didn't you steal some explosives out of the fortress?

1478
01:33:43,010 --> 01:33:45,350
C3, a highly potent explosive from the west.

1479
01:33:46,230 --> 01:33:47,710
Her and the Tatiana outfit is too cute.

1480
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,150
It can be molded into any shape like clay.

1481
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:53,750
With just this much, you could blow up the Shagohad and the lab along with it.

1482
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:55,050
Is that right?

1483
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,930
Are you sure about that?

1484
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:58,290
Yeah, but there's a trick to using it.

1485
01:33:59,130 --> 01:33:59,970
Tell me about it.

1486
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:08,630
She's molding it.

1487
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:13,530
She's so cute.

1488
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:17,990
She's so stinking cute.

1489
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,930
Yeah.

1490
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:21,610
Eva.

1491
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,830
I mean, Tatiana.

1492
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:26,950
The Shagohod's booster unit uses liquid fuel.

1493
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:32,510
The fuel tanks are in the main wing of the weapons lab in the hangar housing the Shagohod itself.

1494
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:34,330
So I should blow up the tanks.

1495
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:35,850
That's the basic idea.

1496
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:38,150
It should be enough to blow up the entire hangar.

1497
01:34:39,990 --> 01:35:39,590
four fuel tanks in order to destroy the hangar you'll have to set explosives on each of those tanks all four of them it should be no sweat for you besides the scientists had the day off today yippee so the hangar is completely deserted not quite they've still got guards posted there so what do i do after i set the c3 the bombs run off a timer oh once the timer has been set this part you guys when the timer reaches zero the bombs will all go off at once how long do i have 20 minutes once the phase 2 trials are finished I wouldn't be surprised if they kill all the scientists to prevent them from talking so you've got to act fast I'll take care of it you got this thank you this part is always tough mmm Eva did you get the data on the shag on from Sokolov yeah that's the mission I was given by Khrushchev mm-hmm America doesn't have any use for it does it she's so pretty I haven't forgotten my other mission either got She's so pretty.

1498
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:42,370
Helping you out.

1499
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:52,250
Follow this cave and go up the ladder at the end.

1500
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:53,730
She's such a tease.

1501
01:35:54,810 --> 01:35:54,830
She's such a tease.

1502
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:56,470
She's just southwest of the weapons lab.

1503
01:35:57,710 --> 01:35:59,570
I gotta put on my new outfit.

1504
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:03,350
Do you remember when you went to rescue Sokolov?

1505
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:03,770
Yep.

1506
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:08,650
Remember there was a locked door when you entered the main wing from the second floor of the east wing?

1507
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,250
Yep, well, I don't remember it was lost.

1508
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:12,210
That's the entrance to the Shagohod's hangar.

1509
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:19,150
Use this key to open that door.

1510
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:19,950
Thank you.

1511
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:22,850
The door, right when I enter the main wing?

1512
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:24,610
Got it.

1513
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:25,310
Got it.

1514
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:26,070
What about you?

1515
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:28,150
I'll get things ready for our escape.

1516
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:28,950
Wait, he says things are so good.

1517
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:30,290
There's a rail bridge to the north.

1518
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:30,870
Got it.

1519
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:34,750
I'm gonna set a bomb there, so I'm taking half of the C3 with me.

1520
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:37,090
No, I think I could use all of it, honestly.

1521
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:39,070
Try not to be in the neighborhood when it happens.

1522
01:36:40,410 --> 01:37:07,370
out for us a lot he suspects you're not who you say you are don't worry the Colonel still trusts me and I have my ways got it there's not a man alive who can resist my charms besides you of course I'm just warning you Eva that's all I know okay let's go would you guys be able to resist you seem like you were born on one of those Aw.

1523
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:10,550
If I didn't ride every day, I couldn't go on living.

1524
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:15,450
When I'm riding, the wind hits me so hard that it hurts.

1525
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:20,330
That pain keeps my mind off the pain of having to be someone else.

1526
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:24,730
It's not easy always fooling myself like this.

1527
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:26,290
No.

1528
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:31,470
It's only when I'm on the bike that I'm free to be the real me.

1529
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:36,270
I only get off my bike when I fall in love.

1530
01:37:36,770 --> 01:38:04,840

01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,860

01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:51,920
Smokernan?

1536
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,320
Or snakes?

1537
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,100
You know what?

1538
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:57,800
I don't want to eat that.

1539
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:58,560
I think our...

1540
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,120

Nice.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1548
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:17,840

Do I even still have him?

1551
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,200
Oh, wait.

1552
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:56,900
Under food.

1553
01:39:58,900 --> 01:40:00,440
They got rid of my parrot.

1554
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:02,780
They took out everything.

1555
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:07,580
Where are my naked snake checkies?

1556
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:10,000
Ribbit.

1557
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:11,000
Ribbit.

1558
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:12,340
Ribbit.

1559
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:13,880
Ribbit.

1560
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:14,260
Ribbit.

1561
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,340
No, we're full.

1562
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:17,760
No.

1563
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:19,060
Please, I'm gonna run out.

1564
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:20,780
The croc disguise?

1565
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:21,920
Oh, yeah, so true.

1566
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:28,960
Where is it?

1567
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:29,220
Oh.

1568
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:36,400
We're gonna have to not wear it for a bit, though, Sasad.

1569
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,060
Because we need

1570
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,140
We need to dress up like a proper man.

1571
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:52,240
Actually, go back to the parrot if you head outside the water while hanging out of a tree.

1572
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:53,600
No way?

1573
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:56,500
Is he still there?

1574
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:07,070
But he's dead.

1575
01:41:07,290 --> 01:41:07,630
We know.

1576
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:09,930
We saw him in the river.

1577
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:11,190
Saying grandpa.

1578
01:41:12,630 --> 01:41:13,710
He's dead.

1579
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:14,770
He's dead.

1580
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:15,790
He's dead.

1581
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:18,090
And he ain't coming back.

1582
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:22,520
Same with the Tsuchinoko.

1583
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,840
Oh, this is the other Tsuchinoko area.

1584
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:29,160
The way he so casually walks back.

1585
01:41:33,400 --> 01:42:02,860
wait thermals oh I didn't I didn't equip the thermals so sorry everybody for your eyes that's a frog is that him no those are plants what is that is that a person or to

1586
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,600

is that is that him in the tree I can't tell what

1588
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:21,930
Hold on.

1589
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:23,770
Let me also get my binoculars.

1590
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:26,050
Oh.

1591
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:28,620
There we go.

1592
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,000
Oh, there he is!

1593
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,440
This is him!

1594
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,060
I see his back.

1595
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,480
Oh, it's him!

1596
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:45,880
Wait, what was...

1597
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:47,280
That?

1598
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:52,930
What the hell?

1599
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:53,950
Oh, it's just a crow.

1600
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:58,070
I was like, what is that thing?

1601
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:00,330
It's, oh my god.

1602
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:02,670
It's a raven, yeah.

1603
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:08,770
Are there guys still here?

1604
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:10,110
Oh, no.

1605
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:11,710
Oh!

1606
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:13,790
I think he took off.

1607
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:16,950
He took off.

1608
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:18,230
I saw his little feathers.

1609
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:20,110
All right, all right.

1610
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:21,790
Eva took him out?

1611
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:24,410
Where's the Tutsi Naka?

1612
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:35,080
I don't think I ever, I don't know if I've ever explored this area.

1613
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:36,880
Yeah.

1614
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:51,360
Wait.

1615
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:54,940
Okay, that's just a place to crawl.

1616
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:56,440
Oh, birds.

1617
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:58,120
Little birds.

1618
01:43:59,620 --> 01:44:00,600
Okay, I know where we are.

1619
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:04,020
Do you ever get him before the torture scene?

1620
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:04,460
No.

1621
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:07,020
In fact, oh, don't bite me, please.

1622
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:08,940
I don't think I have ever gotten one.

1623
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:10,520
Wait, can I eat this guy?

1624
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:12,240
Come here.

1625
01:44:13,620 --> 01:44:14,260
Wait, come here.

1626
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:17,120
What are you?

1627
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,240
I hope you weren't poisonous.

1628
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,120
We're fine.

1629
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:26,040
Then it's not here?

1630
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:27,160
Aw, man.

1631
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:27,640
Dang.

1632
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:28,320
Oh, well.

1633
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:33,810
Well, we got to see the bird.

1634
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:35,350
That was cute.

1635
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:39,190
Alright.

1636
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:41,950
Back to Croc.

1637
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:46,590
Yeah, all muddy.

1638
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:49,630
Authentic crocodile.

1639
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:51,210
Look at his shadow.

1640
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:55,150
Look at the shadow on the wall!

1641
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:02,450
Where is that?

1642
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:04,570
Oh, sneaky.

1643
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:07,510
Sneaky duck.

1644
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:20,800
But...

1645
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:22,280
Shadow tan.

1646
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,460
I still have not found.

1647
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:44,060
Thank you so much for the pit, they get that well.

1648
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:45,640
Thank you!

1649
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:47,720
Ah, I found them!

1650
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:51,360
Yeah, we got them both this time.

1651
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:56,180
Photo mode.

1652
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:57,240
shadow puppets?

1653
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:00,720
Okay.

1654
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:06,020
Watching my Oshi play MGS3 while playing Death Stranding, enjoying Popeyes!

1655
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:07,620
Peak day indeed.

1656
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:08,960
Sounds so nice.

1657
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:11,620
Getting close to a year now.

1658
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,120
Sura, thank you!

1659
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:15,620
Alrighty.

1660
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,200
Where do I get the uniform?

1661
01:46:24,990 --> 01:46:26,010
Don't reach out.

1662
01:46:29,570 --> 01:46:33,850
I sure hope nobody blocks our escape.

1663
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:35,110
You know, we came out of here.

1664
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:39,070
I sure hope nobody seals it shut.

1665
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:10,780
Nobody notice.

1666
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,600
He's huge.

1667
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,600
Nobody notice.

1668
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:25,870
Rikov lockers have uniform.

1669
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:28,570
Okay.

1670
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:30,550
Dang, I have to go...

1671
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:34,790
Well, I guess I have to go through there anyway, I don't know.

1672
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:36,850
Don't stand up, Snake!

1673
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:40,490
Okay, I know there's dogs around here now.

1674
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:43,950
Okay, alright.

1675
01:47:45,350 --> 01:47:48,510
We can go through that door.

1676
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:52,770
And go back inside.

1677
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:59,290
Not if you use a cardboard box to fast travel.

1678
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:00,270
Which car...

1679
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:00,610
Which...

1680
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:03,950
what do I jump into to fast travel

1681
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:12,610
oh why are there so many of you hello

1682
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:32,630
why back of a truck to the north I don't know which direction I'm even facing right now oh I know where it is okay I do know I do know it's like past there through oh Gakko I see him.

1683
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:35,250
I'm getting deja vu.

1684
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:36,150
Me too.

1685
01:48:37,490 --> 01:48:39,390
I'm getting a what's wrong?

1686
01:48:39,710 --> 01:48:40,870
Loop deja vu right now.

1687
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:44,110
There's so many guys!

1688
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:46,690
Oh, jeez.

1689
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:48,910
Okay.

1690
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:52,470
I just gotta try.

1691
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:15,590
It might be easier if he's like further away, you know.

1692
01:49:15,850 --> 01:49:16,250
Oh.

1693
01:49:19,670 --> 01:49:20,790
Oh, where are you going?

1694
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:22,730
You're not going to say what's wrong?

1695
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:24,910
What's wrong?

1696
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:26,150
There we go.

1697
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:30,310
Save the line, Bart!

1698
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:32,630
Oh my gosh, wait.

1699
01:49:33,530 --> 01:49:33,870
Oh no.

1700
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:34,290
Wait.

1701
01:49:34,670 --> 01:49:35,170
Oh shoot.

1702
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:40,720
Oh no, it's happening again.

1703
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:45,460
It's not happening again.

1704
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,500
Oh no, it's happening again.

1705
01:49:58,360 --> 01:49:59,500
Why is my aim so bad?

1706
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:00,440
Okay.

1707
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,720
It's not happening again.

1708
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,520
We've managed to avoid looping.

1709
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:09,420
Okay.

1710
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,280
That guy and the dog is asleep.

1711
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,500
I see the truck.

1712
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,020
Cardboard box B.

1713
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:25,820
To Weapons Lab Hangar.

1714
01:50:27,660 --> 01:50:30,480
But they still won't have the uniform.

1715
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:33,620
Oh, wait.

1716
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:34,620
The weapons...

1717
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,220
Beast wing.

1718
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:37,420
What is that?

1719
01:50:37,820 --> 01:50:38,300
Which...

1720
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:38,420
What?

1721
01:50:38,740 --> 01:50:38,940
What?

1722
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:44,860
Where is this?

1723
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:53,180
I guess you gotta go through the long way for Camel.

1724
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,040
I think so.

1725
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:58,380
The hangar drop-off point is close to the lockers.

1726
01:50:58,820 --> 01:50:59,300
Is it?

1727
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:00,480
Oh, yeah.

1728
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:01,780
Because it's right next.

1729
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:16,700
two hopefully you know what let's try let's try for it i think there was one more guy i'm gonna i'm scared i'm up upping my camo i'm upping my camo

1730
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:23,340
i was just even more impressive

1731
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:30,280
i'm 60 now there's a guy over there

1732
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,420
I hear him walking.

1733
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:36,620
I see a dog.

1734
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,840
Oh, I see Kero-tan.

1735
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,800
One thing we don't want is this guy to turn around.

1736
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:54,840
If he does...

1737
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:56,020
Owarida.

1738
01:51:59,580 --> 01:51:59,980
Owarida!

1739
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:01,060
Wait.

1740
01:52:37,070 --> 01:52:37,870
Okay, now...

1741
01:52:37,870 --> 01:52:38,910
We become...

1742
01:52:38,910 --> 01:52:40,070
I don't think I equipped it.

1743
01:52:41,970 --> 01:52:44,070
Okay, hi, oh boy.

1744
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:46,870
Cardboard box, boy.

1745
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:48,830
Let's go.

1746
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:52,290
Suit is good, but Croc hat makes it perfect.

1747
01:52:59,150 --> 01:52:59,490
Hey!

1748
01:53:00,970 --> 01:53:02,430
Oh, I took off the hat.

1749
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:03,710
Aw.

1750
01:53:06,210 --> 01:53:06,690
Aw.

1751
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:07,370
Are

1752
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:11,900
you...

1753
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,700
Waddy duck head.

1754
01:53:24,380 --> 01:54:25,180
We're right by the stairs, so we might be okay i see you've managed to sneak into the hangar somehow yeah the shagahods in here the completed phase two shagahod represents a grave threat to the west we can't allow it to be mass produced you've got to destroy it okay eva's got the data on the shagahod do you think that's safe well i wouldn't exactly say it's safe but khrushchev is a shrewd leader i can't imagine he'd use it for anything other than deterrence deterrence vulgin however is a different story he's planning to use the shagahod to turn the cold war into a blazing hot one we can't let him have it agreed that leaves just one more mission for you to carry out battle suit looks so cool exactly for now just focus on destroying the shagahod yes sir i'll let sigint fill you in on how to destroy it yo like eva was saying if you're looking to blow the whole place sky high the best way is to take out those liquid fuel tanks with the c3 you know there's four tanks in there right you have

1755
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:55,060
to put c3 on all four of them yeah to plan a c3 charge all you gotta do is equip the c3 and well they like if i crouch walk just like tnt but uh make sure you don't plant it in the wrong place you barely got enough c3 as it is right okay good point i'll make sure not to plant anywhere else could man and be careful liquid fuel has a nasty habit of going off at the slightest shock so don't go using any heavy firepower near the tanks unless aiming to get yourself barbecued.

1756
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:55,560
Barbecue!

1757
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:56,720
I'll keep that in mind.

1758
01:54:57,260 --> 01:55:02,540
The C3 charges all have to go off at once if you want to bring down the hangar in one fell swoop.

1759
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:07,820
So if I were you, I'd wait until after you plant the last charge to start the timer mechanism.

1760
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:08,660
All right.

1761
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:12,660
I'll make sure I finish planting all four charges before I start the timer.

1762
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:16,380
Once the timer's set, you've got 20 minutes until it explodes, right?

1763
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:18,060
Sweet the skies in one of the lockers?

1764
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,480
I think that's about all I've got.

1765
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,040
The rest is up to you.

1766
01:55:23,680 --> 01:55:24,740
Good luck, pal.

1767
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:25,480
Thank you.

1768
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:25,760
Thank you.

1769
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:35,440
Okay, there we go.

1770
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:42,200
Okay, so we're next to the stairs, but if I remember correctly, there's a guy like right there.

1771
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:48,280
So we gotta be mighty careful.

1772
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,680
I'm trying to decide what I want to do.

1773
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:12,760
This is...

1774
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:15,520
This could be worse, but it's...

1775
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:16,100
Not great.

1776
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:18,960
Box.

1777
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:21,300
We'll keep the box.

1778
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:23,920
But if they see me walking in it, there's no point.

1779
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:30,880
You know what?

1780
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:31,980
Let's just go for it and see what happens.

1781
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:32,380
Oh, wait.

1782
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:37,560
Let me out.

1783
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:38,220
Thank you.

1784
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,600
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.

1785
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:42,340
Okay, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1786
01:56:44,860 --> 01:56:49,860
If I remember quickly, the guy is like facing the other way anyway, so it's fine.

1787
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:55,730
Sneakings!

1788
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:09,750
Looks so good.

1789
01:57:12,650 --> 01:57:13,510
Looks so good.

1790
01:57:16,730 --> 01:57:22,230
My only thing about this one is I don't like the orange on it, but it just, it does look really good.

1791
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:24,090
Looks so good.

1792
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:39,590
Now, where is the janitor's outfit, the little guy?

1793
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:49,230
Wow, the detail on it's kind of crazy, actually.

1794
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:57,190
But what do them belts do, mister?

1795
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:06,210
Uh, locker closest to the window.

1796
01:58:06,610 --> 01:58:07,420
Okay, thank you.

1797
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:09,240
I ride them.

1798
01:58:14,070 --> 01:58:16,190
Hopefully, we don't get caught.

1799
01:58:18,430 --> 01:58:21,370
I'm scared of someone coming around the corner.

1800
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:28,990
Other side, second from the left?

1801
01:58:31,150 --> 01:58:31,590
What?

1802
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:32,690
What?

1803
01:58:33,270 --> 01:58:33,970
The window?

1804
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:36,590
Or...

1805
01:58:36,590 --> 01:58:37,170
Ah!

1806
01:58:38,270 --> 01:58:39,350
Nah, there we go.

1807
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:41,650
There we go, there we go.

1808
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:46,030
Do you think they'll like my crock suit?

1809
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:50,470
I think I called it a janitor.

1810
01:58:50,670 --> 01:58:51,270
He's maintenance.

1811
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:55,850
Do you think they'll like the crock hat?

1812
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,240
Will they be suspicious with it?

1813
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:15,140
Oh, that's right.

1814
01:59:15,260 --> 01:59:18,000
I can't use this when...

1815
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,720
Um, one thing is, uh...

1816
01:59:30,110 --> 01:59:30,350
Where?

1817
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:31,070
Oh, there it is.

1818
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:33,890
Oh, let's get rid of...

1819
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:35,430
Milksnake.

1820
01:59:37,050 --> 01:59:38,550
Alright, we got our C3.

1821
01:59:49,470 --> 01:59:50,950
Look at that booty!

1822
01:59:57,530 --> 01:59:59,470
This is so messed up.

1823
01:59:59,590 --> 02:00:01,730
Is it the crock hat?

1824
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:05,190
Is

1825
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:10,740
it the crock hat?

1826
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:14,480
Is it that?

1827
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:18,710
No.

1828
02:00:19,330 --> 02:00:20,090
They wouldn't.

1829
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:21,670
They love it.

1830
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:27,640
I might just die and redo this part.

1831
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:29,560
Let's see.

1832
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:30,300
Hold on.

1833
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:33,180
No silly lad, clearly.

1834
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:34,340
Gosh.

1835
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:36,540
Oh wait.

1836
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,620
What if we still are able to do this?

1837
02:01:00,380 --> 02:01:01,080
We're fine.

1838
02:01:05,250 --> 02:01:06,530
This is one of them, right?

1839
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:12,270
Is it?

1840
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:13,970
Wait, is it this one?

1841
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:14,630
No.

1842
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:15,710
Am I crazy?

1843
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:20,190
I know that one's down.

1844
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:22,530
Oh, it's the little... Okay, it's the tank looking thing.

1845
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,200
Wait, how do I place this?

1846
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:34,760
What am I doing wrong?

1847
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:38,460
None up there.

1848
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:40,360
Oh, here we go.

1849
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,480
Wait, how do I place it?

1850
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:45,060
How do I...

1851
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:45,920
How do I place this?

1852
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:46,340
No.

1853
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:47,640
Don't worry about me.

1854
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:53,530
RT, that's what I'm putting.

1855
02:01:53,730 --> 02:01:54,330
That's what I'm doing.

1856
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:57,290
Ah!

1857
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:58,790
It's because I was crouched.

1858
02:01:59,010 --> 02:01:59,230
Okay.

1859
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:00,770
Good to know.

1860
02:02:05,390 --> 02:02:05,830
Okay.

1861
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:18,500
Snake?

1862
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:19,220
Eba.

1863
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:21,580
I finished planting the bomb on the rail bridge.

1864
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:23,200
Only placing caution or lower.

1865
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:23,920
Ah, that's why.

1866
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:24,540
Okay.

1867
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:27,060
That should at least buy us some time.

1868
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:29,080
I've also set up the escape route.

1869
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:30,900
How are things going on your end?

1870
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:32,980
I just finished planting the second child.

1871
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:33,760
Silly is allowed!

1872
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:34,780
Give me a little more time.

1873
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:35,360
Okay.

1874
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,880
They're busy looking for a guy and a croc at it.

1875
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:42,190
They don't know.

1876
02:02:42,830 --> 02:02:43,530
They don't know.

1877
02:02:44,710 --> 02:02:45,150
Do they?

1878
02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:49,070
They don't know.

1879
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:50,150
They don't know.

1880
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:04,180
Uh-oh.

1881
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:04,920
Uh-oh.

1882
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:05,760
Don't catch me.

1883
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:13,500
These dang... These guys are such snitches.

1884
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:15,940
Oh my god, he's right there.

1885
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:16,640
I can't leave.

1886
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:18,840
Wait, is he?

1887
02:03:19,060 --> 02:03:19,800
Yeah, he's right there.

1888
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:20,120
Okay.

1889
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:22,720
We'll wait for him to go.

1890
02:03:25,180 --> 02:03:26,240
Oh my gosh, please leave.

1891
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:28,960
I see his head.

1892
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:37,630
Wait, did he just leave?

1893
02:03:38,410 --> 02:03:39,310
Was that him running away?

1894
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:45,510
Oh, nice.

1895
02:04:09,130 --> 02:04:09,970
Please don't see me.

1896
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:13,630
I am just a measly guy.

1897
02:04:18,530 --> 02:04:19,210
Uh-oh, wait.

1898
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:21,150
Can't do it with this guy here.

1899
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:25,470
Can you see?

1900
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,130
How does she do it?

1901
02:04:56,350 --> 02:05:00,390
Wait, but I don't want the frog mask for the next cutscene because I want to see a little smile.

1902
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:12,240
How does she get away with it?

1903
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:17,790
How does she do it?

1904
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:50,000
Wow.

1905
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:51,460
Easy game.

1906
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:57,320
I can't believe he undoes her heart.

1907
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,520
It's kind of messed up.

1908
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,340
Got you this time.

1909
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:11,060
Yeah!

1910
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:17,640
Nice.

1911
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:23,650
No one sees this.

1912
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:27,450
Major, I finished planting the C3.

1913
02:06:27,910 --> 02:06:29,050
I'm on my way out now.

1914
02:06:30,290 --> 02:06:32,050
Is Eva taking care of the escape room?

1915
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:34,370
No, I kind of wish I had the frog mask on.

1916
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:35,510
She can handle it.

1917
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:37,650
Alright then, we'll hurry up and get out of there.

1918
02:06:41,110 --> 02:06:42,510
Now I kind of wish I had it on.

1919
02:06:46,870 --> 02:06:47,670
It's time!

1920
02:06:49,550 --> 02:06:50,150
Uh-oh.

1921
02:06:50,930 --> 02:06:52,170
She looks so peaceful.

1922
02:06:56,570 --> 02:06:59,670
Oh, I can't with this guy.

1923
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:07,190
Why'd you come back?

1924
02:07:37,310 --> 02:07:38,390
Iconic moment.

1925
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:41,210
Iconic moment.

1926
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:47,860
Uh-oh.

1927
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:51,400
Yes, please.

1928
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:52,640
Yeah, save, please.

1929
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:54,800
Ah, 13.

1930
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:55,840
15 minutes, baby.

1931
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:58,820
And then the clock just keeps on ticking down.

1932
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:07,900
This woman was found snooping around my underground vault.

1933
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:12,140
When she was captured, look what we found on her.

1934
02:08:13,340 --> 02:08:13,580
What?

1935
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:19,160
The Philosopher's Legacy.

1936
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:24,800
Everyone in this room is curious about that.

1937
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:28,940
This microfilm contains only information regarding the legacy.

1938
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:33,720
You might say that this film itself is the philosopher's legacy.

1939
02:08:37,870 --> 02:08:39,570
It was the smell that gave her away.

1940
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:43,570
No, not the perfume.

1941
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:46,390
Ah, gasoline, baby.

1942
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:48,590
It was gasoline.

1943
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:49,770
Ah, yeah, I called it.

1944
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:50,830
Motorcycle gasoline.

1945
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:51,710
Just kidding.

1946
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:53,810
She reeked of it.

1947
02:08:54,230 --> 02:08:54,970
Hi, Sorrow.

1948
02:08:55,650 --> 02:08:56,930
To think that lovely...

1949
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:58,610
Tatyana was a spy.

1950
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:00,170
Oh, lovely Tatyana.

1951
02:09:01,370 --> 02:09:03,730
We found this radio along with her too.

1952
02:09:04,450 --> 02:09:06,610
Yeah, that's really obvious looking.

1953
02:09:09,730 --> 02:09:10,910
That thing is huge.

1954
02:09:11,390 --> 02:09:13,090
Such a fine woman she was.

1955
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:20,870
It almost pains me to have to kill her.

1956
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:31,740
Where did she keep that?

1957
02:09:31,800 --> 02:10:00,340
right obedient one she was my precious little pet such a weirdo isn't that right precious little pet what was that do you have something to say to me oh kiss of death go to hell you

1958
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:12,310
dirty whore I've had enough kisses from you.

1959
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:28,300
I love that line so much you guys don't even understand.

1960
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:32,500
Just like the KGB to send something so beautiful, yet so deadly.

1961
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:34,600
I've had enough kisses from you.

1962
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:37,040
Very well.

1963
02:10:37,960 --> 02:10:40,460
I'll explain it before I kill you.

1964
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:41,960
Oh yeah.

1965
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:43,300
During the last great war.

1966
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:47,900
The most powerful men in America, China, and the Soviet Union had a secret pact.

1967
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:49,540
I've had enough kisses from you.

1968
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,620
The pact was a blueprint for defeating the Axis powers and creating a new world order.

1969
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:58,080
Yeah, explain the whole thing, please.

1970
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:06,160
The three countries pooled their resources to conduct the most covert types of operations and research.

1971
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:12,600
The atomic bomb, rocket technology, the Cobra unit.

1972
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:16,300
I'm gonna be eating a coffee after this.

1973
02:11:16,300 --> 02:11:22,420
And they amassed an enormous sum of money to fund these projects, enough to fight the war five times over.

1974
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:27,240
That wealth is the philosopher's legacy.

1975
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:27,640
Woo!

1976
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:34,160
After the war was won, the three countries were to divide the philosopher's legacy amongst themselves.

1977
02:11:35,740 --> 02:11:43,000
This explains why the United States and the Soviet Union were able to steal away the best scientific minds in Germany as soon as the war ended.

1978
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:49,360
But our great motherland has far surpassed its pathetic rivals.

1979
02:11:51,220 --> 02:11:58,640
We possess enormous wealth, the most advanced technology, and overwhelming power, assets fitting of our great country.

1980
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:01,560
They could have just printed them.

1981
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:05,440
My father was one of the men in charge of managing the philosopher's legacy.

1982
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:13,440
In the confusion that ensued after the war ended, he devised a series of ingenious plots to ensure that the Soviet Union will have total...

1983
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:39,820
control over the legacy i have an alt twitter account was divided up that's just for like me looking at metal gear stuff and retweeting metal gear stuff it's mostly yowie but my twitter banner banner is i've had enough is that screenshot it's that line i've had enough kisses from you i love that line so much after my father's death i learned of this secret and obtained the microfilm

1984
02:12:43,460 --> 02:14:01,440
of Brezhnev and his allies I built this fortress of Grosnygrad and Granin's research facility but that worthless fool Granin failed to produce results I like retweet only I only retweet things that I want to see and then the shaggle sometimes devil may cry and also me gongaga that's like my position in grew made it too troublesome to attack Sokolov's facility directly but the network established by the secret pact still existed I used it to contact the boss and suggested that she defect the boss was conniving enough to see things my way I love their family photo world was once one but the conflict between the philosophers you think the end is awake here we will use the legacy to heal that rift and make the world whole again he looks mighty sleepy to do this we need strength an unstoppable trump card with enough power to bring order to the world how do you make that trump card was to be the shagohad and the Cobra I just made it oh look at them they're so cute

1985
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:19,420
anyway I have lost the Cobras but I still have the Shagohad and the legacy well there is nothing America can do to stop us Boss, take this someplace safe.

1986
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:21,480
Oh, yeah, he still trusts her.

1987
02:14:34,030 --> 02:14:35,570
Take good care of it.

1988
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:44,590
You wouldn't have come waltzing back in here unless he had a reason.

1989
02:14:45,950 --> 02:14:46,950
The C3's been stolen.

1990
02:14:47,030 --> 02:14:48,530
No, I've been skipping back in here.

1991
02:14:49,390 --> 02:14:51,090
I've been hopping around in here.

1992
02:14:51,230 --> 02:14:52,050
I was a frog.

1993
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:55,510
I'll go see if there are any surprises waiting for us.

1994
02:14:58,350 --> 02:14:59,800
I'll dispose of her as well.

1995
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:02,670
Yes.

1996
02:15:06,050 --> 02:15:09,400
Boss is such a girl's girl.

1997
02:15:11,270 --> 02:15:13,470
Ah, I love them.

1998
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:33,770
So cool i know fight like a warrior vulgan but of course how much time we got left

1999
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:53,860
i'm obsessed with whoever did his mocap his facial mocap let me face him oh geez i've been waiting for this moment time to get even you've said that like five times now

2000
02:15:57,020 --> 02:15:58,340
oh yeah

2001
02:16:04,150 --> 02:16:09,190
No more judo and no more field strips It's not judo.

2002
02:16:09,310 --> 02:16:19,670
It's CQC Silly No more gun flips no more gun twirling Nah, I don't I never want him to stop

2003
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:25,750
Enough of this

2004
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:38,650
Uh-oh The gloves are off baby He's mine You will stand right there and watch.

2005
02:16:38,990 --> 02:16:39,430
Got it?

2006
02:16:39,970 --> 02:16:41,190
Please, Colonel, let me...

2007
02:16:46,030 --> 02:16:46,630
Meanwhile,

2008
02:16:57,870 --> 02:16:58,470
the timer...

2009
02:16:58,470 --> 02:16:58,930
I know!

2010
02:17:02,550 --> 02:17:04,910
I have to pee so bad, actually.

2011
02:17:07,170 --> 02:17:09,130
So, before the fight, I will pee.

2012
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:13,970
How much time we got left?

2013
02:17:14,270 --> 02:17:14,930
Oh, seven.

2014
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:37,810
minutes okay thank you go piss girl sorry for the delay I will let's get started shall we shall we our own little arena

2015
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:51,580
I think those pants are too tight for Make it a good one.

2016
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:26,280
It's just you and me now.

2017
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:27,020
So cool!

2018
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:29,460
And I'm going to enjoy this.

2019
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:31,320
I'm sure you will.

2020
02:18:55,430 --> 02:18:57,190
Oh my god.

2021
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:17,540
You're mine, son of the boss.

2022
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:19,920
Okay, and then I pause.

2023
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:22,080
Pause, pause.

2024
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:25,040
Then we pause and I go pee.

2025
02:19:25,640 --> 02:19:28,560
And then we get everything all situated here.

2026
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:32,160
And...

2027
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:33,620
Five minutes, baby.

2028
02:19:34,140 --> 02:19:34,540
Pause?

2029
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:35,100
No!

2030
02:19:35,860 --> 02:19:37,140
I wonder what she's up to.

2031
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:38,940
I kind of want to go pet her and kiss her head.

2032
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:42,080
If I take a little bit longer, I'm petting her and I'm kissing her head.

2033
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,980
Oh, here, you guys can look at his butt in this because...

2034
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:01,750
I just heard something behind me.

2035
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:22,280
I hope it's not a ghost because I should be the only one haunting this place.

2036
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:26,760
My real concern is I hope it wasn't a bug that fell from the ceiling.

2037
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:35,500
The tree frog and glow cabs.

2038
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:40,200
Oh, I forgot to grab the glow cabs when we were in the sewers.

2039
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:42,380
I have no food or anything on me.

2040
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:42,980
Uh-oh.

2041
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:44,080
Wait, I might be in trouble.

2042
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:45,200
Yeah, we're fine.

2043
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:46,180
Okay, anyway, I'll be right back.

2044
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:19,140
My kittens are cute.

2045
02:25:21,260 --> 02:25:22,440
My kittens are cute.

2046
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:24,720
Yeah.

2047
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:29,840
All right.

2048
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:31,700
All right, baby.

2049
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:35,940
Let's put on this.

2050
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:39,480
It's like the perfect time.

2051
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:42,560
Handle.

2052
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:45,800
Oh, come on.

2053
02:25:45,900 --> 02:25:46,960
Wait, can I not?

2054
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:51,400
Oh, there it is.

2055
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:53,840
Oh, he's winking at me.

2056
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:55,920
Do you wash your hands?

2057
02:25:56,040 --> 02:25:56,540
I always do.

2058
02:25:58,780 --> 02:25:59,140
Okay.

2059
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:01,860
Croc time, of course.

2060
02:26:02,760 --> 02:26:04,320
Wait, I can't put on the mask.

2061
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:05,420
Oh, interesting.

2062
02:26:05,860 --> 02:26:07,080
I guess because of the headdress.

2063
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:09,780
Major.

2064
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:10,680
Is that you?

2065
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:14,440
We'll put it on eventually.

2066
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,200
I like when he gets a little flurry.

2067
02:26:16,220 --> 02:26:18,080
lestered over seeing it.

2068
02:26:22,910 --> 02:26:25,010
I can never remember how to do this fight.

2069
02:26:25,270 --> 02:26:27,290
I literally did it not even that long ago.

2070
02:26:27,810 --> 02:26:28,410
I can't remember.

2071
02:26:28,950 --> 02:26:29,610
That's okay though.

2072
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:31,090
We'll figure it out.

2073
02:26:32,790 --> 02:26:33,810
What do I have?

2074
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:37,410
I guess we'll do non-lethal as I've been.

2075
02:26:40,170 --> 02:26:40,770
CQC.

2076
02:26:42,310 --> 02:26:42,910
Um.

2077
02:26:43,390 --> 02:26:46,370
I don't have any glow caps, so don't even mention it.

2078
02:26:46,770 --> 02:26:48,110
Stop talking about it.

2079
02:26:49,430 --> 02:26:50,310
As you can see.

2080
02:26:50,930 --> 02:26:52,050
We have some rations, though.

2081
02:26:52,250 --> 02:26:53,510
What's my food like, anyway?

2082
02:26:56,310 --> 02:26:58,310
My stamina is...

2083
02:26:59,390 --> 02:27:00,030
It's okay.

2084
02:27:01,130 --> 02:27:02,210
Use my judo.

2085
02:27:15,580 --> 02:27:17,040
Toss out the rotten food.

2086
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:19,080
Like, to him?

2087
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:20,180
He won't care.

2088
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:25,400
I wonder if I throw out the tree frog.

2089
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:34,800
But it's not alive, so I don't think he'll care.

2090
02:27:34,820 --> 02:27:36,220
Yeah, they're rotten.

2091
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:38,840
Someone said chaff grenades.

2092
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:39,540
I'll try.

2093
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:43,580
We don't need the C3 anymore.

2094
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:52,280
Bullets are no good because he stops them.

2095
02:27:53,240 --> 02:27:54,960
I think I just gotta dodge everything.

2096
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:56,500
I don't have to...

2097
02:27:56,500 --> 02:27:57,420
Okay, I remember it.

2098
02:27:57,500 --> 02:27:57,980
It's coming back to me.

2099
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:58,780
I hit him.

2100
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:01,480
And then I can stun him.

2101
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:04,240
Not gonna lie, Mint.

2102
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:04,800
This game's a weird one.

2103
02:28:04,820 --> 02:28:05,320
weird.

2104
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:06,680
What?

2105
02:28:09,260 --> 02:28:09,660
What?

2106
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:13,260
What?

2107
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:13,780
What?

2108
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:20,960
Yeah, the roll helps.

2109
02:28:22,820 --> 02:28:23,160
Yes.

2110
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:26,400
Okay, let's get into it, baby.

2111
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:27,700
Hello!

2112
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:29,120
Whoa.

2113
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:31,100
Why am I so slow all of a sudden?

2114
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:31,880
Okay, come here.

2115
02:28:36,810 --> 02:28:37,790
Oh, shoot!

2116
02:28:38,030 --> 02:28:38,170
Wait!

2117
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:38,910
Where's my gun?

2118
02:28:39,030 --> 02:28:40,010
Oh my gosh, I didn't have it.

2119
02:28:40,630 --> 02:28:41,050
Oh.

2120
02:28:42,530 --> 02:28:42,890
Nice.

2121
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:49,360
Here it come.

2122
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:50,560
Here it come.

2123
02:28:52,100 --> 02:28:52,740
What is coming?

2124
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:56,060
What is coming?

2125
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:56,620
What is coming?

2126
02:28:58,520 --> 02:28:59,280
Ouch!

2127
02:28:59,600 --> 02:28:59,760
Ouch!

2128
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:00,100
Oh, out.

2129
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:02,260
Okay, sorry.

2130
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:07,760
Okay.

2131
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:09,980
Putcher.

2132
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:16,080
Putcher.

2133
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:16,920
Okay.

2134
02:29:28,970 --> 02:29:29,690
and just run.

2135
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:37,540
Oh, I can only get, like, one hit in, okay.

2136
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:40,100
Oh, let's do this real quick.

2137
02:29:40,220 --> 02:29:41,460
I got a gunshot wound.

2138
02:29:43,740 --> 02:29:44,540
I'm bleeding.

2139
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:45,380
I'm bleeding.

2140
02:29:48,220 --> 02:29:48,820
Oh, disinfected.

2141
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:09,760
The way he just, like, drops to the ground is too good.

2142
02:30:10,480 --> 02:30:13,020
Okay, we got to be aggressive because...

2143
02:30:18,870 --> 02:30:20,690
Because we don't have much time left!

2144
02:30:23,590 --> 02:30:24,810
Thank you, Asula!

2145
02:30:27,550 --> 02:30:27,990
Ouch!

2146
02:30:32,820 --> 02:30:33,760
Ouch, Ouch, out, out, out.

2147
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:35,040

2150
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:44,980

2151
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:47,060

2152
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:48,620

2153
02:30:50,860 --> 02:30:51,300
Okay.

2154
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:05,360
Shoot him!

2155
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:09,800
Do you hear me?

2156
02:31:09,900 --> 02:31:12,100
I said shoot him!

2157
02:31:14,320 --> 02:31:15,440
Sorry, Colonel.

2158
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:17,120
I'm afraid I can't do that.

2159
02:31:17,900 --> 02:31:19,800
What do you mean you can't?

2160
02:31:20,660 --> 02:31:22,720
I made a promise to the boss.

2161
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:24,520
Silence!

2162
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:27,080
I am your commander.

2163
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:27,680
officer

2164
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:47,060

2165
02:31:53,870 --> 02:31:55,950
why does it look like that

2166
02:32:02,310 --> 02:32:12,630
fight like a man Vulcan Vulcan emergency Explosives have been detected.

2167
02:32:12,690 --> 02:32:13,030
Uh-oh.

2168
02:32:13,050 --> 02:32:15,730
Hold not EOD personnel must evacuate immediately.

2169
02:32:16,030 --> 02:32:16,450
Uh-oh.

2170
02:32:16,570 --> 02:32:19,170
Ocelot, find those bombs!

2171
02:32:19,170 --> 02:32:20,990
I like how he's still pointing at him.

2172
02:32:22,730 --> 02:32:22,990
Repeat.

2173
02:32:23,610 --> 02:32:24,850
Explosives have been detected.

2174
02:32:25,290 --> 02:32:27,590
Hold not EOD personnel must evacuate immediately.

2175
02:32:29,490 --> 02:32:30,210
Moving!

2176
02:32:31,930 --> 02:32:32,050
Huh.

2177
02:32:32,870 --> 02:32:33,110
Huh.

2178
02:32:54,440 --> 02:32:57,520
Ready for some more, Snake?

2180
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:30,940
I'm not trying to.

2181
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:36,840
Here's where... Okay, we're in phase two.

2182
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:40,040
I'm gonna eat a ration.

2183
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:43,260
Because we're gonna start getting hungry.

2184
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:44,560
Sick.

2185
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:47,080
But...

2186
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:50,820
Do I change?

2187
02:33:52,120 --> 02:33:55,320
Oh, well, no, we can change during the next bit.

2188
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:56,420
We should be able to.

2189
02:33:57,880 --> 02:33:58,480
I think.

2190
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:01,420
I think we should be able to.

2191
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:03,140
Sick!

2192
02:34:07,540 --> 02:34:09,920
Accidentally... I was trying to zoom up!

2193
02:34:10,140 --> 02:34:10,860
I was!

2194
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:15,540
Yeah, I want to change back for cutscenes.

2195
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:21,500
But I think the battle suit is good for this because it helps us take less damage.

2196
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:22,340
Okay, anyway.

2197
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:27,100
Maybe right before I beat him up!

2198
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:34,460
We don't have a lot of time!

2199
02:34:37,660 --> 02:34:38,800
Oh, oops, I did not.

2200
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:40,960
Oh, well, this works actually.

2201
02:34:41,360 --> 02:34:44,740
Uh, I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding.

2202
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:45,660
Uh, bandage.

2203
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:47,000
And disinfect.

2204
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:49,900
There we go.

2205
02:35:08,350 --> 02:35:09,450
Where'd he go?

2206
02:35:09,490 --> 02:35:09,710
Oh.

2207
02:35:16,430 --> 02:35:17,070
Oh, oh.

2208
02:35:17,350 --> 02:35:17,870
There we go.

2209
02:35:19,690 --> 02:35:20,910
Okay, somehow I got him.

2210
02:35:22,390 --> 02:35:24,470
Oh my gosh, I only have two minutes left.

2211
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:25,350
Come on.

2212
02:35:25,570 --> 02:35:26,150
Go again.

2213
02:35:33,340 --> 02:35:36,040
The CQC is so easy in this game, it's awesome.

2214
02:35:37,480 --> 02:35:37,620
Yeah.

2215
02:35:51,050 --> 02:35:52,030
Is this where I get on the ground?

2216
02:35:52,290 --> 02:35:52,530
Yeah.

2217
02:35:54,110 --> 02:35:55,590
Oh no, this is where I run!

2218
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:10,840
This is where he does the shoot across the field.

2219
02:36:19,210 --> 02:36:20,510
Oh my gosh.

2220
02:36:20,650 --> 02:36:21,270
It's so funny.

2221
02:36:29,860 --> 02:36:31,780
Oh no, wait, now he's...

2222
02:36:36,990 --> 02:36:37,310

02:38:05,100 --> 02:38:05,700
I can't remember.

2239
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:09,500
I can't remember if there's something special I have to do.

2240
02:38:11,780 --> 02:38:13,060
Or if it's just gonna fade the bell out.

2241
02:38:13,160 --> 02:38:13,520
He's black.

2242
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:14,320
He's done.

2243
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:15,220
Okay, we're done.

2244
02:38:16,900 --> 02:38:17,860
Oh yeah, the timer's gone.

2245
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:18,440
Yippee!

2246
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:20,780
Ah, okay.

2247
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:22,120
Ah, I can't remember.

2248
02:38:22,380 --> 02:38:24,360
I was like, wait, is there something special I need to do here?

2249
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:25,040
Yeah!

2250

2251
02:38:29,060 --> 02:38:29,320

Woo!

2254
02:38:35,500 --> 02:38:37,260
That was so clutch.

2255
02:38:37,420 --> 02:38:38,040
Holy moly.

2256
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:39,460
I almost didn't make it.

2257
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:41,580
There's like 18 seconds left or something.

2258
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:42,000
Crazy.

2259
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:48,940
Holy...

2260
02:38:48,940 --> 02:38:50,040
Oh, come on.

2261
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:50,880
It was just...

2262
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:51,800
It was just...

2263
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:52,300
Trank.

2264
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:03,700
Get out of there.

2265
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:09,540

If he's stuck right now, you could just go.

2325
02:46:24,540 --> 02:46:25,540
Then blow him up long with it.

2326
02:46:25,660 --> 02:46:26,160
Good plan.

2327
02:46:26,340 --> 02:46:27,840
The bridge is on the other side of the runway.

2328
02:46:27,980 --> 02:46:29,440
We'll have to cut through the middle of the base.

2329
02:46:29,580 --> 02:46:29,880
You ready?

2330
02:46:30,040 --> 02:46:30,540
Step on it.

2331
02:46:30,600 --> 02:46:32,100
If he catches up to us, we're done for.

2332
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:32,960
Oh!

2333
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:34,240
Ah!

2334
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:37,120
How could you miss?

2335
02:46:37,280 --> 02:46:38,400
Okay, here we go.

2336
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:39,340
That's embarrassing.

2337
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:42,300
Oh, he's getting put on the big gear.

2338
02:46:56,460 --> 02:46:57,220
Morning, Sean.

2339
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:00,080
It's his heart.

2340
02:47:00,700 --> 02:47:02,480
He doesn't actually want to miss.

2341
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:05,160
He knows this.

2342
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:09,760
He doesn't actually want it to hit.

2343
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:10,860
He wants to miss.

2344
02:47:12,180 --> 02:47:13,220
Grab him by the hair.

2345
02:47:15,560 --> 02:47:16,540
Grab him by the snout.

2346
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:21,280
Woo!

2347
02:47:22,040 --> 02:47:22,280
Woo!

2348
02:47:22,560 --> 02:47:22,720
Woo!

2349
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:39,860
We forgot to twirl.

2350
02:47:49,340 --> 02:47:51,200
Okay, watch where we're driving.

2351
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:51,940
Yeah, yeah.

2352
02:47:52,300 --> 02:47:52,960
Okay, cool.

2353
02:48:03,700 --> 02:48:06,680
Oh my god, she's just blacking them.

2354
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:29,880
Wow.

2355
02:48:30,460 --> 02:48:31,360
So sexy.

2356
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:31,980
Oh.

2357
02:48:34,040 --> 02:48:35,500
Don't worry, I won't kill you!

2358
02:48:37,100 --> 02:48:37,740
Don't worry!

2359
02:48:41,020 --> 02:48:42,440
Don't let him get away, he says.

2360
02:48:42,680 --> 02:48:43,540
Oh, I'm here.

2361
02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:44,500
I'm aiming.

2362
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:46,780
Oh, we just drove fast, everybody.

2363
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:47,520
Okay, hold on.

2364
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:49,540
Hold on, hold on, one second, one second.

2365
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:50,720
Oh, one second, one second.

2366
02:48:51,080 --> 02:48:51,640
Oh, I got him.

2367
02:48:51,940 --> 02:48:52,600
I got him.

2368
02:48:52,840 --> 02:48:52,940
Okay.

2369
02:48:53,480 --> 02:48:54,320
Oh, I got him.

2370
02:48:54,420 --> 02:48:54,640
Nice.

2371
02:48:55,740 --> 02:48:56,100
Helicopter.

2372
02:48:56,220 --> 02:48:57,080
Oh, no, that's not a helicopter.

2373
02:48:57,200 --> 02:48:57,700
That's a man.

2374
02:48:58,260 --> 02:48:58,900
Oh, my aim.

2375
02:49:00,540 --> 02:49:01,780
Oh, my gosh!

2376
02:49:02,460 --> 02:49:03,420
Holy cow!

2377
02:49:03,940 --> 02:49:04,840
Uh, can I get you?

2378
02:49:05,500 --> 02:49:06,000
There we go.

2379
02:49:06,260 --> 02:49:06,720
Who else is aiming?

2380
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:08,280
Oh, thank you.

2381
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:12,820
God, a stinking RPG on me!

2382
02:49:14,380 --> 02:49:14,860
You're

2383
02:49:19,400 --> 02:49:19,640
gone.

2384
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:20,760
You were there and...

2385
02:49:20,760 --> 02:49:21,620
Oh, you're gone?

2386
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:22,700
Okay, wait, we're fine.

2387
02:49:25,460 --> 02:49:28,120
The cross suit is very sick, everybody, okay?

2388
02:49:28,360 --> 02:49:30,200
Like, don't worry even a little bit about it.

2389
02:49:30,380 --> 02:49:30,940
I got one.

2390
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:32,220
I got two.

2391
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:33,520
Reloading.

2392
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:34,400
Don't come at me.

2393
02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:35,560
Got three.

2394
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:36,440
Got four.

2395
02:49:36,840 --> 02:49:37,540
Got five.

2396
02:49:38,180 --> 02:49:38,960
Uh, six.

2397
02:49:39,780 --> 02:49:41,300
Uh, anyone with an RPG?

2398
02:49:41,740 --> 02:49:42,280
I don't know.

2399
02:49:42,400 --> 02:49:43,640
Oh, thank you.

2400
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:59,800
You can't just say above, Eva.

2401
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:01,480
Where are we driving in circles?

2402
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:02,760
We were already here, no.

2403
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:04,840
Like, we can leave.

2404
02:50:05,460 --> 02:50:06,420
Just escape.

2405
02:50:06,540 --> 02:50:07,200
There you go.

2406
02:50:08,140 --> 02:50:09,520
I don't even see people.

2407
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:10,420
I'm blind.

2408
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:17,200
I didn't get to see people.

2409
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:18,180
a single one.

2410
02:50:25,070 --> 02:50:26,910
My eye is out.

2411
02:50:27,330 --> 02:50:28,230
Please, understand.

2412
02:50:29,030 --> 02:50:30,070
Move the aim.

2413
02:50:33,130 --> 02:50:34,010
Oh, stun grenades?

2414
02:50:34,630 --> 02:50:34,630
Yeah.

2415
02:50:36,410 --> 02:50:38,070
That probably would have been good, huh?

2416
02:50:46,900 --> 02:50:48,040
We're fine.

2417
02:50:48,420 --> 02:50:49,420
We're fine.

2418
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:52,500
We're fine.

2419
02:50:54,340 --> 02:50:55,780
Okay, but then...

2420
02:50:57,920 --> 02:51:00,380
We'll see how fine we are,

2421
02:51:06,580 --> 02:51:07,460
Damn it!

2422
02:51:11,730 --> 02:51:13,490
Why are you killing them?

2423
02:51:14,130 --> 02:51:14,850
Just keep...

2424
02:51:16,070 --> 02:51:17,250
It's not their fault.

2425
02:51:17,390 --> 02:51:18,250
You're so slow.

2426
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:28,540
Why did the helicopter decide to do that?

2427
02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:35,540
Like, why was the helicopter like, Oh yeah, I'll try and pick you up, buddy.

2428
02:51:36,260 --> 02:51:36,940
in front of them.

2429
02:51:42,620 --> 02:51:44,120
Here he comes!

2430
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:50,780
I hope this is three miles of highway.

2431
02:51:53,640 --> 02:51:56,080
Alright, now I need the RPG, huh?

2432
02:51:57,680 --> 02:51:59,140
Now I need it, huh?

2433
02:52:00,100 --> 02:52:01,340
Wait, I have one, right?

2434
02:52:02,180 --> 02:52:02,620
Yeah.

2435
02:52:06,990 --> 02:52:08,310
I'll get rid of my fork.

2436
02:52:13,490 --> 02:52:13,930
You

2437
02:52:25,860 --> 02:52:32,280

2439
02:52:55,400 --> 02:52:55,600
That?

2440
02:52:55,760 --> 02:52:55,880
That?

2441
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:57,060
Okay I was gonna say that.

2442
02:53:01,380 --> 02:53:02,820
That hit, that hit.

2443
02:53:10,900 --> 02:53:11,960
Am I gonna be okay?

2444
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:15,640
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2445
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:31,600
How does Eva have so much more health than me?

2446
02:53:34,860 --> 02:53:36,740
Might want to throw the battle suit on.

2447
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:40,720
We'll do it for the fight, we will.

2448
02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:48,440
No one shoots the babe, so true.

2449
02:53:55,830 --> 02:53:58,650
I thought the crock suit was so thick.

2450
02:53:59,810 --> 02:53:59,810
I've

2451
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:12,120
got a surprise for you.

2452
02:54:12,500 --> 02:54:14,240
You won't be getting away this time.

2453
02:54:14,380 --> 02:54:14,700
Uh-oh.

2454
02:54:18,120 --> 02:54:18,960
Oh, so hard.

2455
02:54:27,100 --> 02:54:27,700
Yippee!

2456
02:54:28,460 --> 02:54:29,680
Son of a bitch!

2457
02:54:30,060 --> 02:54:31,180
This face.

2458
02:54:33,260 --> 02:54:37,630
We just have a great skincare routine to recover.

2459
02:54:37,650 --> 02:54:38,830
from that.

2460
02:54:39,230 --> 02:54:39,370
Look

2461
02:54:43,420 --> 02:54:44,820
at the croc hat, it's just...

2462
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:49,820
Okay, um...

2463
02:54:49,820 --> 02:54:51,700
What if I RPG...

2464
02:54:53,890 --> 02:54:54,790
And miss.

2465
02:54:55,190 --> 02:54:55,430
Okay.

2466
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:25,300
Can I get it again?

2467
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:26,100
And we

2468
02:55:55,310 --> 02:55:55,530
should...

2469
02:55:55,530 --> 02:55:57,150
What am I supposed to do about missiles?

2470
02:55:58,490 --> 02:56:00,010
Oh, my gosh!

2471
02:56:00,630 --> 02:56:01,630
I'm just a crocodile!

2472
02:56:02,570 --> 02:56:05,210
I'm just a poor croc!

2473
02:56:05,530 --> 02:56:08,110
Oh, that one.

2474
02:56:08,130 --> 02:56:10,430
It's not good.

2475
02:56:16,540 --> 02:56:18,300
Trank them.

2476
02:56:22,500 --> 02:56:26,500
All right, we're gonna get our, uh, what's it called out?

2477
02:56:38,820 --> 02:56:40,420
Here comes the missiles.

2478
02:56:46,060 --> 02:56:46,940
Dorifto!

2479
02:56:50,500 --> 02:56:52,120
Oh, the croctail.

2480
02:57:03,300 --> 02:57:05,160
The croctail almost hitting the ground.

2481
02:57:05,360 --> 02:57:06,100
It's cracking me up.

2482
02:57:06,160 --> 02:57:07,240
We've only got one chance.

2483
02:57:07,540 --> 02:57:09,500
We'll lure him over towards the other side.

2484
02:57:09,640 --> 02:57:09,960
What'd you say?

2485
02:57:10,200 --> 02:57:12,420
When the Shagohara is on the bridge, shoot the explosives.

2486
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:14,980
The bomb is planted on the strut of the bridge.

2487
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:15,380
Okay.

2488
02:57:16,260 --> 02:57:17,280
I'll shoot it.

2489
02:57:17,640 --> 02:57:19,020
I'll shoot it real good.

2490
02:57:19,100 --> 02:57:19,900
I won't miss.

2491
02:57:25,780 --> 02:57:27,020
Keep going!

2492
02:57:28,340 --> 02:57:29,660
Mint perfect shot?

2493
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,240
Always, always, always.

2494
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:31,940
Let's go.

2495
02:57:32,780 --> 02:57:35,860
I don't know why she keeps stopping, you know.

2496
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:39,560
Why do you keep stopping the car?

2497
02:57:40,140 --> 02:57:41,080
It's my question.

2498
02:57:41,820 --> 02:57:43,340
Like, why are you doing

2499
02:57:53,440 --> 02:57:53,820
that?

2500
02:57:54,040 --> 02:57:55,200
It's not a car.

2501
02:57:56,420 --> 02:57:57,800
You're not a genius.

2502
02:57:58,700 --> 02:58:00,700
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

2503
02:58:06,020 --> 02:58:07,680
She has motion sync.

2504
02:58:08,300 --> 02:58:11,540
She has to do it.

2505
02:58:15,690 --> 02:58:18,810
Okay, one second, Eva, I gotta equip it in my backpack!

2506
02:58:22,900 --> 02:58:23,740
Where do I...

2507
02:58:23,740 --> 02:58:25,260

2693
03:13:03,100 --> 03:13:03,700
Let's go.

2694
03:13:10,730 --> 03:13:13,310
He's really fast, actually.

2695
03:13:13,850 --> 03:13:14,850
Okay, so...

2696
03:13:15,550 --> 03:13:17,590
I can still stun or...

2697
03:13:17,590 --> 03:13:19,650
Do I get anything for doing it non-lethal?

2698
03:13:20,190 --> 03:13:20,870
I don't remember.

2699
03:13:24,330 --> 03:13:25,010
Like...

2700
03:13:25,010 --> 03:13:25,830
Oh my god!

2701
03:13:26,010 --> 03:13:26,790
Are you kidding me?

2702
03:13:45,990 --> 03:13:47,210
Where's my Mosin?

2703
03:13:47,490 --> 03:13:48,290
There we go.

2704
03:13:49,330 --> 03:13:50,110
That's hilarious.

2705
03:13:54,110 --> 03:13:54,870
Oh, wait.

2706
03:13:57,370 --> 03:13:58,070
Oh my gosh.

2707
03:13:59,550 --> 03:13:59,650
Oh.

2708
03:13:59,830 --> 03:14:00,710
I see him.

2709
03:14:03,510 --> 03:14:03,990
Oh,

2710
03:14:10,140 --> 03:14:10,380
gosh.

2711
03:14:10,540 --> 03:14:11,680
Okay, we can't do Kero-Tan.

2712
03:14:11,800 --> 03:14:12,360
I'm so sorry.

2713
03:14:12,640 --> 03:14:13,120
Okay.

2714
03:14:14,840 --> 03:14:17,060
We can't get out of time, I'm so sorry.

2715
03:14:23,080 --> 03:14:23,860
I can't move.

2716
03:14:27,040 --> 03:14:27,500
Oh, wow.

2717
03:14:27,700 --> 03:14:28,340
These are pretty good.

2718
03:14:34,100 --> 03:14:35,180
Okay, nice.

2719
03:14:54,240 --> 03:14:55,920
That was crazy.

2720
03:14:56,740 --> 03:14:57,880
Holy cow.

2721
03:14:58,820 --> 03:14:59,860
Holy cow.

2722
03:15:01,500 --> 03:15:03,520
Come and get me!

2723
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:05,020
Nice!

2724
03:15:10,210 --> 03:15:13,610
Wait, this is so... this is not so bad at all actually.

2725
03:15:14,190 --> 03:15:14,750
Oh my gosh.

2726
03:15:16,410 --> 03:15:18,790
Wait, this is actually not so bad at all so far?

2727
03:15:19,070 --> 03:15:19,250
Okay.

2728
03:15:20,170 --> 03:15:20,430
Oops!

2729
03:15:21,290 --> 03:15:21,290
Oops!

2730
03:15:24,210 --> 03:15:24,350
Ah!

2731
03:15:35,550 --> 03:15:36,110
Wait!

2732
03:15:36,570 --> 03:15:36,950
No!

2733
03:15:40,670 --> 03:15:41,830
Almost hit Eva!

2734
03:15:46,150 --> 03:15:47,310
She would be fine.

2735
03:15:47,450 --> 03:15:48,110
She'd be fine.

2736
03:15:56,260 --> 03:15:57,580
Wait, how do I...

2737
03:15:57,580 --> 03:15:58,300
Oh, no.

2738
03:15:59,480 --> 03:15:59,960
There we go.

2739
03:16:12,440 --> 03:16:14,040
I got stuck.

2740
03:16:15,300 --> 03:16:15,360
Oops.

2741
03:16:16,420 --> 03:16:16,860
That's fine.

2742
03:16:17,620 --> 03:16:20,300
Can I get some more supplies, actually?

2743
03:16:23,240 --> 03:16:24,860
Wait, that's gonna explode.

2744
03:16:26,440 --> 03:16:27,020
Oh,

2745
03:16:37,710 --> 03:16:38,010
wrong.

2746
03:16:38,030 --> 03:16:38,170
Wrong.

2747
03:16:42,250 --> 03:16:43,970
Oh, that was close.

2748
03:16:44,610 --> 03:16:50,420
I can't move!

2749
03:16:51,880 --> 03:16:52,640
So close!

2750
03:16:52,820 --> 03:16:53,800
So close!

2751
03:16:53,920 --> 03:16:54,100
Ouch!

2752
03:17:00,440 --> 03:17:00,920
Eva!

2753
03:17:01,780 --> 03:17:02,920
Do your distracting thing?

2754
03:17:03,140 --> 03:17:04,020
Your job?

2755
03:17:05,580 --> 03:17:07,080
Do your distracting thing?

2756
03:17:07,140 --> 03:17:08,080
The thing you were gonna do?

2757
03:17:09,540 --> 03:17:11,040
The thing you were supposed to be doing?

2758
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:12,940
Yeah.

2759
03:17:20,360 --> 03:17:21,620
Wait, this was so easy.

2760
03:17:21,640 --> 03:17:37,320
easy this was so easy wow it was i remember i think he shot more missiles in the first game like in the original i mean

2761
03:17:42,700 --> 03:17:50,280
and uh and i could never shoot them down but in this game it's much easier to shoot them down

2762
03:17:54,840 --> 03:17:56,520
She said the thing.

2763
03:17:58,080 --> 03:17:58,700
His hair.

2764
03:18:00,200 --> 03:18:01,780
Vulcan, you're so funny.

2765
03:18:02,020 --> 03:18:02,840
Don't go bald.

2766
03:18:07,160 --> 03:18:08,780
Kulabara, Kulabara!

2767
03:18:25,800 --> 03:18:27,000
Oh, it's...

2768
03:18:28,340 --> 03:18:30,160
It's actually so gruesome.

2769
03:18:43,940 --> 03:18:46,280
Yeah, the bullets on him are like...

2770
03:18:46,280 --> 03:18:47,720
Fried by a bolt of lightning.

2771
03:18:48,340 --> 03:18:48,360
Yeah.

2772
03:18:49,940 --> 03:18:51,400
A fitting end.

2773
03:18:53,800 --> 03:18:54,860
It's finally over.

2774
03:19:16,160 --> 03:19:17,720
It's like fireworks.

2775
03:19:19,720 --> 03:19:20,880
Croc view.

2776
03:19:21,700 --> 03:19:23,020
You love to see it.

2777
03:19:25,480 --> 03:19:27,300
Just a little bit more.

2778
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:29,520
Just a little bit more.

2779
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:30,140
Yeah.

2780
03:19:30,540 --> 03:19:32,340
The escape craft is just up ahead.

2781
03:19:33,520 --> 03:19:34,140
The weak.

2782
03:19:36,040 --> 03:19:37,020
We gotta

2783
03:19:42,700 --> 03:19:43,000
get...

2784
03:19:43,020 --> 03:19:44,380
They can fly?

2785
03:19:44,880 --> 03:19:44,880
Yeah!

2786
03:19:46,140 --> 03:19:46,980
They can!

2787
03:19:48,140 --> 03:19:50,140
I don't think they should be going this fast.

2788
03:19:53,760 --> 03:19:55,300
So loud, oh my gosh.

2789
03:19:59,780 --> 03:20:02,040
Death is more gruesome due to the added gourd.

2790
03:20:02,540 --> 03:20:03,100
Right, right.

2791
03:20:03,200 --> 03:20:03,840
Oh, my bad.

2792
03:20:04,020 --> 03:20:05,080
That's not what I meant to do.

2793
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:07,060
Bullets are literally ripping them apart.

2794
03:20:07,240 --> 03:20:08,180
It's really sick.

2795
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:12,260
Oh wait, I can still use this.

2796
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:14,240
I'll try.

2797
03:20:18,400 --> 03:20:22,000
No, you guys act like these guys weren't floating earlier in the game.

2798
03:20:22,200 --> 03:20:23,020
They totally were.

2799
03:20:26,220 --> 03:20:29,140
It's only in one scene though, but they are.

2800
03:20:30,220 --> 03:20:30,940
They are.

2801
03:20:45,110 --> 03:20:45,830
Or something.

2802
03:20:45,930 --> 03:20:46,230
Or two.

2803
03:20:46,350 --> 03:20:46,890
Just keep shooting.

2804
03:20:47,570 --> 03:20:48,330
Just keep shooting.

2805
03:20:48,950 --> 03:20:49,790
I got them.

2806
03:20:49,930 --> 03:20:50,350
I got them.

2807
03:20:50,790 --> 03:20:51,630
Oh, so bad.

2808
03:21:02,200 --> 03:21:03,920
How many minkees does it take to shoot?

2809
03:21:04,300 --> 03:21:05,260
Oh my god, there's more of them.

2810
03:21:05,840 --> 03:21:07,500
Don't worry, I got him.

2811
03:21:08,580 --> 03:21:10,580
I can't get this one stinking guy.

2812
03:21:11,680 --> 03:21:11,920
But

2813
03:21:29,700 --> 03:21:31,400
you can't drive and shoot, right?

2814
03:21:34,670 --> 03:21:36,910
How are you still alive?

2815
03:22:12,040 --> 03:22:13,380
The last cobra.

2816
03:22:15,960 --> 03:22:17,380
Oh, we're fine, we're fine.

2817
03:22:18,340 --> 03:22:18,780
Don't worry.

2818
03:22:19,200 --> 03:22:19,760
I'll just shoot.

2819
03:22:20,680 --> 03:22:21,240
I'll just shoot.

2820
03:22:28,720 --> 03:22:31,480
Oh my god, how am I so bad?

2821
03:22:38,080 --> 03:22:39,820
It's actually hilarious.

2822
03:22:41,620 --> 03:22:42,460
No way.

2823
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:44,040
Oh my god.

2824
03:22:46,760 --> 03:22:47,360
We're fine.

2825
03:22:47,980 --> 03:22:48,700
Everything's fine.

2826
03:22:49,620 --> 03:22:49,640
Oh.

2827
03:22:52,140 --> 03:22:54,560
You're like so shielded.

2828
03:22:54,840 --> 03:22:55,320
Come on.

2829
03:22:55,960 --> 03:22:56,600
Let me get you.

2830
03:22:56,620 --> 03:22:57,660
Oh, we got him.

2831
03:22:58,320 --> 03:22:58,720
I think.

2832
03:22:59,420 --> 03:23:00,360
Oh my gosh.

2833
03:23:00,460 --> 03:23:01,000
No deaths.

2834
03:23:01,540 --> 03:23:02,220
No deaths.

2835
03:23:02,840 --> 03:23:03,240
No deaths.

2836
03:23:05,620 --> 03:23:06,420
No deaths!

2837
03:23:07,060 --> 03:23:07,640
Where are you?

2838
03:23:08,460 --> 03:23:09,360
Uh, wrong time?

2839
03:23:09,480 --> 03:23:09,880
Wrong time?

2840
03:23:11,620 --> 03:23:13,260
Oh, I didn't even equip it.

2841
03:23:14,860 --> 03:23:18,560
We got him.

2842
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:19,360
We got him.

2843
03:23:19,780 --> 03:23:20,520
We got him.

2844
03:23:20,580 --> 03:23:21,080
We got him.

2845
03:23:21,120 --> 03:23:22,120
Stop going up and down, please.

2846
03:23:22,160 --> 03:23:22,460
There we go.

2847
03:23:22,920 --> 03:23:23,440
We got him?

2848
03:23:23,560 --> 03:23:24,040
There's more?

2849
03:23:25,320 --> 03:23:26,260
Oh, my gosh.

2850
03:23:30,090 --> 03:23:31,310
Never-ending chase scene?

2851
03:23:31,530 --> 03:23:32,250
Wait, where are you?

2852
03:23:43,210 --> 03:23:44,290
I am shooting the log.

2853
03:23:44,410 --> 03:23:45,310
Wait, what's the log?

2854
03:23:45,390 --> 03:23:46,070
Oh, that's the log.

2855
03:23:47,510 --> 03:23:48,310
I got you?

2856
03:24:14,150 --> 03:24:17,410
Oh, there's more.

2857
03:24:17,650 --> 03:24:18,290
Oh, my gosh.

2858
03:24:19,010 --> 03:24:19,850
Of course there is.

2859
03:24:20,470 --> 03:24:23,590
This is the never-ending cutscene ever.

2860
03:24:25,310 --> 03:24:26,570
I won't let you live this time.

2861
03:24:26,790 --> 03:24:27,690
Oh, did I get Kero-Tan?

2862
03:24:28,030 --> 03:24:28,790
Wait, I got the guy.

2863
03:24:29,090 --> 03:24:29,630
You can't shoot.

2864
03:24:30,150 --> 03:24:30,690
You can shoot.

2865
03:24:30,970 --> 03:24:31,510
You can shoot.

2866
03:24:31,710 --> 03:24:32,850
You can shoot and drive.

2867
03:24:32,950 --> 03:24:33,750
You're so talented.

2868
03:24:34,510 --> 03:24:35,350
Oh, my gosh.

2869
03:24:36,370 --> 03:24:37,030
You're the guy.

2870
03:24:37,230 --> 03:24:38,830
You're the one to do it.

2871
03:24:49,860 --> 03:24:50,260
Nice.

A jump?

She's still far away Or

Eva.

2885
03:27:39,420 --> 03:27:39,880

03:27:52,640 --> 03:27:53,940
You have to get away from here, Eva.

03:27:55,500 --> 03:27:55,940
Let's go.

2892
03:27:56,020 --> 03:27:56,880
Sorry, I'm lagging a little.

2893
03:27:57,100 --> 03:27:57,380
Leave me.

2894
03:27:58,560 --> 03:27:58,860
Eva.

2895
03:27:59,740 --> 03:27:59,920
No.

2896
03:27:59,920 --> 03:28:01,200
The boss is waiting for you.

2897
03:28:01,380 --> 03:28:02,900
You have to go.

03:28:06,820 --> 03:28:06,920
Yeah.

2901
03:28:07,440 --> 03:28:09,200
We're still far away from the lake.

2902
03:28:09,380 --> 03:28:10,270
I'll never make it.

2903
03:28:12,920 --> 03:28:14,100
I can't believe this.

2904
03:28:15,540 --> 03:28:17,780
I never thought I'd see you act this week.

2905
03:28:18,300 --> 03:28:18,320
Oh.

2906
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:20,000
What do you mean?

2907
03:28:21,240 --> 03:28:22,100
Listen to me, Eva.

2908
03:28:22,480 --> 03:28:23,580
We're doing this together.

2909
03:28:24,580 --> 03:28:25,400
No, you...

2910
03:28:25,400 --> 03:28:27,720
Eva, I need you.

2911
03:28:31,180 --> 03:28:39,940

Oh my god!

2915
03:29:20,230 --> 03:29:22,450
You're lucky to have me.

2916
03:29:22,630 --> 03:29:24,250
Girl, how are you standing?

2917
03:29:32,600 --> 03:29:33,520
Bandage, Snake!

2918
03:29:34,380 --> 03:29:34,620
Yeah!

2919
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:36,280
Oh wait.

2920
03:29:38,740 --> 03:29:41,560
It might be time to observe Eva.

2921
03:29:41,960 --> 03:29:42,900
Snake, can you hear me?

2922
03:29:43,380 --> 03:29:44,960
Paramedic, thank God.

2923
03:29:45,460 --> 03:29:46,700
Eva's been seriously hurt.

2924
03:29:46,840 --> 03:29:47,940
Wow, this rain ASMR?

2925
03:29:48,080 --> 03:29:50,820
Luckily, I think her organs are all intact, but...

2926
03:29:50,820 --> 03:29:51,700
Calm down, soon.

2927
03:29:51,780 --> 03:29:52,360
This is nice.

2928
03:29:52,680 --> 03:29:53,140
Calm down.

2929
03:29:53,800 --> 03:29:59,300
You'll both be fine as long as you get the proper emergency treatment, but you're the only one who can do this.

2930
03:29:59,600 --> 03:29:59,920
Understand?

2931
03:30:00,440 --> 03:30:01,980
So you've got to calm down.

2932
03:30:02,440 --> 03:30:02,720
Right.

2933
03:30:03,340 --> 03:30:03,800
Okay.

2934
03:30:04,320 --> 03:30:04,840
Okay.

2935
03:30:05,260 --> 03:30:08,140
Now let's open up the Survival Viewer and treat the injury.

2936
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:09,700
Do you have supplies with you?

2937
03:30:10,040 --> 03:30:11,680
I'm running kind of short.

2938
03:30:12,320 --> 03:30:16,220
Then by switching the Survival Viewer over to Eva, you can treat her wounds too.

2939
03:30:16,620 --> 03:30:17,360
Now get to work.

2940
03:30:18,080 --> 03:30:49,300

A bandage.

2944
03:30:58,120 --> 03:30:58,840
Disinfectment.

2945
03:31:01,520 --> 03:31:02,960
Bone fracture.

2946
03:31:04,860 --> 03:31:05,200
Oh, no.

2947
03:31:05,360 --> 03:31:07,440
We only have max supplies.

2948
03:31:09,100 --> 03:31:09,500
Oh, no.

2949
03:31:09,680 --> 03:31:10,940
Whatever will we do?

2950
03:31:11,840 --> 03:31:15,440
We're only completely maxed out.

2951
03:31:15,800 --> 03:31:16,400
Oh, there we go.

2952
03:31:18,360 --> 03:31:20,080
Whatever will we do?

2953
03:31:26,930 --> 03:31:29,450

2954
03:31:32,130 --> 03:31:32,890

Oh yeah girl.

2957
03:31:38,970 --> 03:31:41,150
Oh nice bones on this body.

2958
03:31:41,730 --> 03:31:42,590

03:31:50,210 --> 03:31:54,850
That pelvic burn, I know, I know.

03:31:57,450 --> 03:31:58,730
Oh wait, what is it?

2963
03:31:59,370 --> 03:32:00,510
Medical history, here it is.

2964
03:32:03,410 --> 03:32:04,870
What's a proctitis?

2965
03:32:05,070 --> 03:32:06,230
I feel like I asked that before.

2966
03:32:07,070 --> 03:32:10,450
Oh no, tummy horrid, she got a little stomach ache.

2967
03:32:11,390 --> 03:32:11,810
Oh no.

2968
03:32:12,370 --> 03:32:14,550
Electrical burn, hypoxia.

2969
03:32:17,210 --> 03:32:19,070
Broken nail, where?

2970
03:32:20,210 --> 03:32:23,050
She got poisoned and then it broke her nail.

2971
03:32:23,250 --> 03:32:24,050
It's so sad.

2972
03:32:27,350 --> 03:32:28,850
It's when your butt hurts.

2973
03:32:29,030 --> 03:32:29,550
Oh, no.

2974
03:32:29,890 --> 03:32:30,750
Blow sustained.

2975
03:32:30,930 --> 03:32:31,750
She got a cold.

2976
03:32:32,350 --> 03:32:32,930
Another tummy ache.

2977
03:32:33,150 --> 03:32:33,290
Tummy ache.

2978
03:32:33,610 --> 03:32:34,570
And her ear infection.

2979
03:32:35,030 --> 03:32:35,690
Oh, ew, ew.

2980
03:32:36,250 --> 03:32:37,090
A cavity.

2981
03:32:38,010 --> 03:32:38,570
Uh-oh.

2982
03:32:39,070 --> 03:32:39,590
Bronchitis.

2983
03:32:40,890 --> 03:32:41,870
I hope you're having a good day.

2984
03:32:41,930 --> 03:32:45,390
Hi, eating Mike Tyson's ass.

2985
03:32:46,710 --> 03:32:49,890

03:32:50,210 --> 03:32:53,250
Does Mike Tyson have proctitis?

2987
03:32:54,830 --> 03:32:56,430
Slate paralysis!

2988
03:32:57,610 --> 03:32:59,450
Oh my gosh, I'm haunting her.

2989
03:33:01,570 --> 03:33:04,050
Tick-borne encephalitis.

2990
03:33:04,610 --> 03:33:05,350
Frostbite!

2991
03:33:05,530 --> 03:33:07,370
My girl has been through it.

2992
03:33:10,030 --> 03:33:11,330
What's she eating?

2993
03:33:11,630 --> 03:33:12,890
Oh yeah, she eats good.

2994
03:33:13,930 --> 03:33:14,630
This girl!

2995
03:33:17,270 --> 03:33:19,130
That's that me espresso.

2996
03:33:21,670 --> 03:33:24,010
They're a tummy whore a lot.

2997
03:33:24,990 --> 03:33:25,710
Look at this.

2998
03:33:26,010 --> 03:33:28,150
Gorgonzola cream fettuccini.

2999
03:33:28,530 --> 03:33:29,630
Rat.

3000
03:33:32,810 --> 03:33:35,290
Chinese almond jelly.

3001
03:33:36,190 --> 03:33:37,730
European rabbit.

3002
03:33:37,970 --> 03:33:39,050
Actually, that kind of sounds fancy.

3003
03:33:40,790 --> 03:33:42,890
Yabloko maloko sorbet.

3004
03:33:43,750 --> 03:33:44,970
Vampire bat.

3005
03:33:45,690 --> 03:33:47,710
This is messed up.

3006
03:33:50,770 --> 03:34:15,850
Tona Seabream Amberjack Sashimi with Plum Garnish Reticulated Python This is messed up Where's the one that says like she got the boob job Electrical burn Lower back pain Her boobs are just too big

Wait, which one is it?

3009
03:34:36,920 --> 03:34:38,220
I pass it again.

3010
03:34:39,480 --> 03:34:40,420
What is it called?

3011
03:34:42,480 --> 03:34:43,720
Below stomach ache.

3012
03:34:43,960 --> 03:34:44,300
There's a couple.

3013
03:34:44,440 --> 03:34:45,520
Oh, there it is.

3014
03:34:45,700 --> 03:34:46,020
I can't.

3015
03:34:46,200 --> 03:34:47,440
Wow, I'm so blind.

3016
03:34:48,360 --> 03:34:49,280
Breast enhancement.

3017
03:34:52,740 --> 03:34:53,600
They look good.

3018
03:35:03,160 --> 03:35:05,220
They look We're bleeding.

3019
03:35:06,260 --> 03:35:07,600
We'll sew that up.

3020
03:35:08,060 --> 03:35:08,840
We'll stop at it.

3021
03:35:08,940 --> 03:35:10,060
We'll put that bandage on.

3022
03:35:13,560 --> 03:35:16,520
She's bleeding out, and I'm looking at her boobies.

3023
03:35:19,320 --> 03:35:22,260
Sutsure, bleeding, bandage.

3024
03:35:33,260 --> 03:35:34,160
Are you okay?

3025
03:35:34,320 --> 03:35:35,000
Can you walk?

3026
03:35:35,480 --> 03:35:35,660
Yeah.

3027
03:35:36,280 --> 03:35:37,200
I think so.

3028
03:35:37,760 --> 03:35:38,820
Can you be quiet?

3029
03:35:39,240 --> 03:35:41,780
Because now it's an escort mission.

3030
03:35:41,940 --> 03:35:44,300
Because for some reason, Kojima loves these.

3031
03:35:48,610 --> 03:35:49,810
She is so...

3032
03:35:49,810 --> 03:35:53,750
Like, she has nothing on her face, and we're just dirty, dirty, dirty.

3033
03:35:55,550 --> 03:35:57,190
She's so clean, pristine.

3034
03:35:58,150 --> 03:36:00,090
Drop the skincare routine, queen.

3035
03:36:01,610 --> 03:36:02,510
She's so pretty.

3036
03:36:02,610 --> 03:36:03,470
It's different from the Mouser.

3037
03:36:04,290 --> 03:36:10,830
When you're using a two-hand grip, you have to be careful where you put your hands or your fingers or get burned to exhaust gas from the cylinder gap.

3038
03:36:13,590 --> 03:36:45,090

Your Fujoshi showing, I'm so sorry.

3040
03:36:47,450 --> 03:36:48,070
I'm so sorry.

3041
03:36:48,330 --> 03:36:50,570
If you lie on your belly, she'll lie down as well.

3042
03:36:50,830 --> 03:36:50,850
Okay.

3043
03:36:50,970 --> 03:36:53,850
If you slip and fall off a cliff, she'll follow right behind.

3044
03:36:54,030 --> 03:36:58,350
Now that this playthrough is nearing its head, I have the urge to play some MGS while modding and starting a fight.

3045
03:36:58,350 --> 03:37:00,030
Head to the lake along with Eva.

3046
03:37:01,330 --> 03:37:02,370
That's so good.

3047
03:37:03,090 --> 03:37:04,370
Does she crouch walk?

3048
03:37:05,670 --> 03:37:07,050
Like, important question.

3049
03:37:07,510 --> 03:37:08,770
It doesn't look like she does.

3050
03:37:08,930 --> 03:37:09,690
Do you know what you're doing?

3051
03:37:10,310 --> 03:37:12,810
What, a girl, I just started getting started.

3052
03:37:13,490 --> 03:37:15,110
Chill out.

3053
03:37:17,470 --> 03:37:18,970
Oh, call Eva.

3054
03:37:21,490 --> 03:37:22,950
Are you stupid or something?

3055
03:37:23,770 --> 03:37:25,650
Why are you so mean to me?

3056
03:37:27,370 --> 03:37:29,010
I'm taking care of you!

3057
03:37:34,450 --> 03:37:36,050
Luckily, um...

3058
03:37:36,050 --> 03:37:37,490
Our stamina...

3059
03:37:38,130 --> 03:37:39,230
Actually, I'm gonna eat these.

3060
03:37:41,450 --> 03:37:42,650
I'm gonna eat these.

3061
03:37:44,890 --> 03:37:46,250
Because of the crock cap?

3062
03:37:46,850 --> 03:37:46,850
No.

3063
03:37:47,830 --> 03:37:48,510
No way.

3064
03:37:48,910 --> 03:37:49,750
There's no way.

3065
03:37:51,810 --> 03:37:52,290
Yeah.

3066
03:37:54,050 --> 03:37:54,530
Yeah.

3067
03:37:55,610 --> 03:37:56,090
Delish.

3068
03:37:56,770 --> 03:37:58,510
Oh, look at them swimming!

3069
03:38:00,970 --> 03:38:03,370
Let's get rid of some things in my backpack.

3070
03:38:04,310 --> 03:38:05,430
Like, we don't need this anymore.

3071
03:38:05,550 --> 03:38:06,550
We don't need that anymore.

3072
03:38:06,790 --> 03:38:08,130
We don't need that anymore.

3073
03:38:09,070 --> 03:38:11,610
We could do the stun grenade, though, just in case.

3074
03:38:14,150 --> 03:38:16,050
Ah, we'll put a book down, maybe.

3075
03:38:18,690 --> 03:38:20,490
We could also...

3076
03:38:21,930 --> 03:38:22,670
Oh, okay.

3077
03:38:23,150 --> 03:38:24,490
We can throw that down, maybe, too.

3078
03:38:24,850 --> 03:38:26,110
Do you have a death wish?

3079
03:38:26,310 --> 03:38:26,810
Why is...

3080
03:38:26,810 --> 03:38:27,030
Why?

3081
03:38:27,130 --> 03:38:28,750
Stop being such a hater.

3082
03:38:29,350 --> 03:38:29,510
Okay?

3083
03:38:29,730 --> 03:38:30,650
Wait, am I going the right way?

3084
03:38:35,880 --> 03:38:36,520
This way?

3085
03:38:44,640 --> 03:38:45,080
Eva!

3086
03:38:47,860 --> 03:38:49,740
Eva, I will continue on without you.

3087
03:38:51,440 --> 03:38:51,880
Eva!

3088
03:38:53,740 --> 03:38:56,220
Oh, whoa, you can see the flame.

3089
03:38:56,500 --> 03:38:56,910
It's so cool.

3090
03:38:58,900 --> 03:38:59,980
Eva, get down, girl.

3091
03:39:02,160 --> 03:39:02,380
Eva!

3092
03:39:03,420 --> 03:39:04,000
Eva!

3093
03:39:10,910 --> 03:39:12,210
What's wrong with you?

3094
03:39:13,630 --> 03:39:13,970
Oh, well.

3095
03:39:13,990 --> 03:39:15,390
Come on, get serious.

3096
03:39:16,130 --> 03:39:17,710
Oh, why is she such a hater?

3097
03:39:18,510 --> 03:39:19,150
Real question.

3098
03:39:25,970 --> 03:39:27,490
We're gonna start coming in.

3099
03:39:28,550 --> 03:39:29,430
Here they are.

3100
03:39:31,230 --> 03:39:34,530
You've been using the croc cap the entire mission and now she complains.

3101
03:39:47,490 --> 03:39:49,010
Stop trying to act all cool.

3102
03:39:49,270 --> 03:39:53,220
Like, you know what's...

3103
03:39:53,220 --> 03:39:56,160
We're soldiers with 179 IQ!

3104
03:39:59,580 --> 03:40:00,660
The Johnny squad.

3105
03:40:00,860 --> 03:40:01,680
Everybody's Johnny.

3106
03:40:16,120 --> 03:40:18,240
Actually, my camo is like super bad.

3107
03:40:19,860 --> 03:40:20,500
Let's see.

3108
03:40:21,200 --> 03:40:23,040
I think it would be better if we were in a crocodile suit.

3109
03:40:24,240 --> 03:40:24,880
Everybody else agree?

3110
03:40:24,880 --> 03:40:25,580
Say I.

3111
03:40:26,700 --> 03:40:26,860
Okay.

3112
03:40:27,480 --> 03:40:28,120
Good job.

3113
03:40:28,560 --> 03:40:29,180
Glad we're in agreement.

3114
03:40:32,420 --> 03:40:32,980
Why?

3115
03:40:33,340 --> 03:40:33,640
What?

3116
03:40:33,760 --> 03:40:33,980
What?

3117
03:40:34,120 --> 03:40:34,720
What happened?

3118
03:40:36,540 --> 03:40:37,280
Wait, what happened?

3119
03:40:40,380 --> 03:40:41,460
Did Eva get caught?

3120
03:40:42,080 --> 03:40:42,700
No kidding.

3121
03:40:44,380 --> 03:40:45,940
Oh, I have my fork out.

3122
03:40:47,320 --> 03:40:48,680
Don't worry, I'll fork him.

3123
03:40:53,250 --> 03:40:54,030
Where'd he go?

3124
03:40:54,910 --> 03:40:55,690
Oh, there he is.

3125
03:40:56,910 --> 03:40:57,290
Eva.

3126
03:40:57,490 --> 03:40:59,790
Eva, I'm really disappointed in you.

3127
03:41:00,690 --> 03:41:02,210
Eva, this is a no kill run!

3128
03:41:06,570 --> 03:41:07,110
Come on, Eva.

3129
03:41:07,690 --> 03:41:08,090
Come on.

3130
03:41:13,820 --> 03:41:16,320
I thought if I crawl... Oh wait, she can't crawl.

3131
03:41:16,640 --> 03:41:16,980
That's right.

3132
03:41:17,180 --> 03:41:18,500
Or she can't crouch walk.

3133
03:41:19,460 --> 03:41:20,760
I'm so hungry.

3134
03:41:21,900 --> 03:41:22,880
Okay, fine.

3135
03:41:23,120 --> 03:41:23,700

3136
03:41:25,160 --> 03:41:25,680

03:41:27,060 --> 03:41:28,120
How do I give this to you?

3139
03:41:28,740 --> 03:41:29,260
Oh.

3140
03:41:29,520 --> 03:41:30,160

Come here.

3149
03:42:17,300 --> 03:42:18,500
Do you know what you're doing?

3150
03:42:18,600 --> 03:42:19,700
Oh my God, don't get up.

3151
03:42:19,960 --> 03:42:20,580
Don't get up.

3152
03:42:21,680 --> 03:42:22,580
I'm gonna give you the bat.

3153
03:42:26,500 --> 03:42:28,220
This tastes like crap.

3154
03:42:28,820 --> 03:42:28,940
How?

3155
03:42:30,380 --> 03:42:32,080
Use this to buy you a happy meal.

3156
03:42:34,080 --> 03:42:35,060
Alright, come on.

3157
03:42:35,480 --> 03:42:36,320
Oh my gosh, Eva.

3158
03:42:36,760 --> 03:42:37,220
Keep going.

3159
03:42:38,880 --> 03:42:39,980
Eva, we're almost there.

3160
03:42:40,840 --> 03:42:41,700
This is the way, right?

3161
03:42:42,080 --> 03:42:42,840
I'm almost positive.

3162
03:42:46,960 --> 03:42:48,260
Oh my god.

3163
03:42:52,590 --> 03:42:53,450
Ouch, ow, ow, ow.

3164
03:42:54,390 --> 03:42:55,270
Ow, ow, ow, my aim.

3165
03:42:56,790 --> 03:42:58,290
No, Eva, it's us!

3166
03:42:59,030 --> 03:43:00,170
We're pacifists run!

3167
03:43:00,530 --> 03:43:01,750
Oh, my aim!

3168
03:43:02,390 --> 03:43:02,810
Please!

3169
03:43:04,490 --> 03:43:05,530
I still got him.

3170
03:43:06,010 --> 03:43:06,230
No!

3171
03:43:06,530 --> 03:43:07,710
No, we're knocking him out.

3172
03:43:07,850 --> 03:43:08,410
We're not killing him.

3173
03:43:10,450 --> 03:43:11,330
I'm right here.

3174
03:43:12,690 --> 03:43:13,210
Snake.

3175
03:43:13,710 --> 03:43:13,930
Come here.

3176
03:43:14,590 --> 03:43:15,750
Come here, little Eva.

3177
03:43:16,790 --> 03:43:17,450
Come on.

3178
03:43:17,790 --> 03:43:18,830
Oh, my gosh.

3179
03:43:25,790 --> 03:43:28,430
I feel no sense of urgency here.

3180
03:43:28,570 --> 03:43:29,910
Oh, Eva is not near me.

3181
03:43:30,050 --> 03:43:31,270
Damn, girl.

3182
03:43:33,950 --> 03:43:34,470
Eva!

3183
03:43:35,470 --> 03:43:35,990
Oh, my gosh.

3184
03:43:36,010 --> 03:43:36,770
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

3185
03:43:37,430 --> 03:43:37,930
Come here.

3186
03:43:38,430 --> 03:43:38,970
Come here.

3187
03:43:39,430 --> 03:43:40,010
Come here.

3188
03:43:44,830 --> 03:43:45,390
My gosh.

3189
03:43:47,150 --> 03:43:48,630
Wait, how do I, uh...

3190
03:43:49,230 --> 03:43:51,870
Oh, I was gonna try and turn off the...

3191
03:43:51,870 --> 03:43:53,310
I wanna just see her, you know?

3192
03:43:56,610 --> 03:43:56,890
Okay.

3193
03:43:57,250 --> 03:43:58,230
Um, you have a bullet watch.

3194
03:43:58,370 --> 03:43:59,170
I can get that out.

3195
03:43:59,290 --> 03:43:59,970
I can help you.

3196
03:44:00,970 --> 03:44:01,990
Uh, we're disinfecting.

3197
03:44:02,870 --> 03:44:03,150
We're...

3198
03:44:03,150 --> 03:44:04,230
We're suturing.

3199
03:44:04,510 --> 03:44:05,010
Oh, no, we're not.

3200
03:44:05,130 --> 03:44:05,510
We're bandaging.

3201
03:44:05,590 --> 03:44:06,170
Oh, we're stifting it.

3202
03:44:06,230 --> 03:44:06,570
There we go.

3203
03:44:11,440 --> 03:44:13,120
You need ibuprofen.

3204
03:44:13,740 --> 03:44:15,280
Come on, girl.

3205
03:44:15,720 --> 03:44:16,160
This way.

3206
03:44:19,680 --> 03:44:20,620
Keep on going.

3207
03:44:21,360 --> 03:44:21,840
Which way?

3208
03:44:22,920 --> 03:44:23,980
Okay, we're almost there.

3209
03:44:27,640 --> 03:44:28,320
No, it's right here.

3210
03:44:28,440 --> 03:44:29,780
It's right here, Eva, please.

3211
03:44:30,620 --> 03:44:31,180
Eva, please.

3212
03:44:32,740 --> 03:44:34,380
They're going to be like, you can't go without Eva.

3213
03:44:35,340 --> 03:44:35,800
Come on, Eva.

3214
03:44:37,180 --> 03:44:38,220
Come on, girl.

3215
03:44:38,700 --> 03:44:39,340
Oh, my gosh.

3216
03:44:39,700 --> 03:44:40,060
Again.

3217
03:44:41,160 --> 03:44:41,960
Oh, my gosh.

3218
03:44:43,940 --> 03:44:44,380
You.

3219
03:44:44,840 --> 03:44:45,280
Bastard!

3220
03:44:46,200 --> 03:44:49,900
What are you?

3221
03:44:50,460 --> 03:44:51,700
Girl, get over here.

3222
03:44:52,280 --> 03:44:53,120
Girl, girl, girl!

3223
03:44:53,980 --> 03:44:56,900
Eva, are you okay?

3224
03:44:58,100 --> 03:44:58,840
Come on, come on.

3225
03:44:59,060 --> 03:44:59,820
Hey, it's me.

3226
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:00,000
Come

3227
03:45:04,250 --> 03:45:04,710
on.

3228
03:45:05,270 --> 03:45:05,470
Eva.

3229
03:45:06,170 --> 03:45:07,230
Eva, you're not...

3230
03:45:07,230 --> 03:45:08,190
Eva, you're in really bad shape.

3231
03:45:08,450 --> 03:45:08,810
Okay, come on.

3232
03:45:09,290 --> 03:45:10,630
I could see QC you.

3233
03:45:11,330 --> 03:45:11,690
Why?

3234
03:45:15,030 --> 03:45:15,770
Oh, Eva.

3235
03:45:17,050 --> 03:45:17,490
She's all...

3236
03:45:17,490 --> 03:45:18,510
You guys, it's not her fault.

3237
03:45:18,630 --> 03:45:20,730
She's all silly about things right now.

3238
03:45:21,550 --> 03:45:24,330
Medical history, gunshot wound times fifth.

3239
03:45:24,750 --> 03:45:26,010
She's all silly right now.

3240
03:45:26,150 --> 03:45:27,010
It's not her fault.

3241
03:45:27,870 --> 03:45:29,270
It's not her fault, okay?

3242
03:45:39,740 --> 03:45:40,540
Oh my gosh.

3243
03:45:40,720 --> 03:45:41,040
Badish.

3244
03:45:41,620 --> 03:45:43,140
I'm gonna run out of everything because of her.

3245
03:45:45,480 --> 03:45:46,740
I'm looking fine.

3246
03:45:47,520 --> 03:45:48,180
Just a little bloody.

3247
03:45:48,400 --> 03:45:48,860
That's okay.

3248
03:45:49,440 --> 03:45:50,100
Okay, come on.

3249
03:45:50,220 --> 03:45:51,620
Are you stupid or something?

3250
03:45:51,840 --> 03:45:52,320
Come on.

3251
03:45:52,360 --> 03:45:52,720
No!

3252
03:45:52,980 --> 03:45:54,100
God damn!

3253
03:45:57,960 --> 03:45:59,340
Oh, he got down.

3254
03:46:00,960 --> 03:46:01,460
Please.

3255
03:46:01,840 --> 03:46:02,100
Please.

3256
03:46:02,740 --> 03:46:03,540
Oh my god.

3257
03:46:03,560 --> 03:46:04,860
Oh my gosh.

3258
03:46:07,960 --> 03:46:08,880
Oh my god.

3259
03:46:09,560 --> 03:46:11,440
I wish I could leave things to you.

3260
03:46:11,620 --> 03:46:12,720
But you're just that stupid.

3261
03:46:15,120 --> 03:46:15,660
Come on.

3262
03:46:16,220 --> 03:46:17,040
Come on.

3263
03:46:17,080 --> 03:46:17,660
Eva, come on.

3264
03:46:17,840 --> 03:46:18,220
This way.

3265
03:46:19,340 --> 03:46:19,780
Please.

3266
03:46:20,220 --> 03:46:20,740
Please, Eva.

3267
03:46:23,300 --> 03:46:24,900
They're going to say you can't go without Eva.

3268
03:46:25,320 --> 03:46:26,780
The lake is just over that cliff.

3269
03:46:27,360 --> 03:46:29,260
Eva should be able to climb it if you help her.

3270
03:46:29,580 --> 03:46:30,640
Keep her close to you.

3271
03:46:30,760 --> 03:46:31,220
I'm trying.

3272
03:46:32,400 --> 03:46:32,840
Come here.

3273
03:46:33,120 --> 03:46:33,440
Come on.

3274
03:46:33,560 --> 03:46:34,620
We're walking!

3275
03:46:35,480 --> 03:46:35,860
We're walking!

3276
03:46:36,180 --> 03:46:36,420
Please!

3277
03:46:36,940 --> 03:46:37,280
Please!

3278
03:46:42,100 --> 03:46:42,860
Uh-oh, wait.

3279
03:46:42,940 --> 03:46:44,640
Am I doing the next cutscene in this outfit?

3280
03:46:45,980 --> 03:46:46,420
Oops.

3281
03:46:48,320 --> 03:46:49,160
Can CQ see her?

3282
03:46:49,340 --> 03:46:52,780
Because sometimes when a man and a woman feel a certain way about each other...

3283
03:46:52,780 --> 03:46:53,880
Yeah, they want to wrestle.

3284
03:46:54,560 --> 03:46:55,600
I get it.

3285
03:46:56,980 --> 03:46:57,940
I know, I know.

3286
03:47:02,030 --> 03:47:03,770
You're lucky you're so cute, Eva.

3287
03:47:06,430 --> 03:47:07,430
Oh, there's still more.

3288
03:47:07,450 --> 03:47:08,610
Oh my gosh, I forgot.

3289
03:47:10,250 --> 03:47:11,410
Oh, geez.

3290
03:47:11,850 --> 03:47:12,650
Okay, okay.

3291
03:47:12,930 --> 03:47:13,370
Oh, me?

3292
03:47:14,430 --> 03:47:15,590
When did I get shot?

3293
03:47:19,390 --> 03:47:19,870
Uh...

3294
03:47:39,580 --> 03:47:41,380
Oh, I didn't see that guy at all.

3295
03:47:44,400 --> 03:47:45,540
Where are you guys going?

3296
03:47:45,780 --> 03:47:45,840
Oh.

3297
03:47:50,660 --> 03:47:51,760
You don't get out of my way.

3298
03:47:58,490 --> 03:47:59,130
I don't know each other.

3299
03:48:00,870 --> 03:48:01,150
Where?

3300
03:48:01,990 --> 03:48:02,350
Eva?

3301
03:48:04,570 --> 03:48:05,470
Eva, you can.

3302
03:48:05,890 --> 03:48:08,050
Eva, actually, I don't know where the shots are coming from.

3303
03:48:08,450 --> 03:48:09,250
I'm like so lost.

3304
03:48:10,350 --> 03:48:10,750
Oh.

3305
03:48:11,550 --> 03:48:11,950
What?

3306
03:48:12,430 --> 03:48:12,670
Huh?

3307
03:48:13,750 --> 03:48:13,870
Oh?

3308
03:48:14,730 --> 03:48:15,070
Huh?

3309
03:48:15,990 --> 03:48:16,790
Where were they coming from?

3310
03:48:17,190 --> 03:48:18,130
Wait, where were they coming from?

3311
03:48:18,290 --> 03:48:18,490
For real?

3312
03:48:24,110 --> 03:48:24,910
Come on!

3313
03:48:25,030 --> 03:48:26,130
Come on!

3314
03:48:26,290 --> 03:48:26,690
Eva!

3315
03:48:27,130 --> 03:48:27,690
No, no, no, no!

3316
03:48:29,030 --> 03:48:31,730
My legs won't move anymore.

3317
03:48:32,610 --> 03:48:33,890
Do I need a CQCU?

3318
03:48:35,190 --> 03:48:35,850
Is that what you need?

3319
03:48:35,870 --> 03:48:36,430
me to do?

3320
03:48:45,690 --> 03:48:46,670
Come on.

3321
03:48:49,940 --> 03:48:50,840
You won't let me.

3322
03:48:51,940 --> 03:48:52,380
Come on.

3323
03:48:52,500 --> 03:48:52,640
Eva!

3324
03:48:54,220 --> 03:48:55,060
Oh my gosh.

3325
03:48:56,420 --> 03:48:56,700
Where?

3326
03:48:56,920 --> 03:48:57,120
Actually.

3327
03:48:57,960 --> 03:48:59,100
It's like...

3328
03:48:59,800 --> 03:49:00,320
Where?

3329
03:49:02,180 --> 03:49:03,100
The trees?

3330
03:49:10,460 --> 03:49:11,840
Eva, do you need some food?

3331
03:49:11,980 --> 03:49:12,320
Oh, sorry.

3332
03:49:15,020 --> 03:49:16,100
I'll give you a bag.

3333
03:49:17,840 --> 03:49:18,920
She's so blind.

3334
03:49:19,040 --> 03:49:20,340
I literally can't say it.

3335
03:49:20,460 --> 03:49:21,120
I'm sorry.

3336
03:49:24,100 --> 03:49:25,340
Bush on the left.

3337
03:49:27,500 --> 03:49:29,220
Ah, I see him.

3338
03:49:29,520 --> 03:49:30,760
How is that blind?

3339
03:49:30,920 --> 03:49:31,980
Don't be a jerk.

3340
03:49:32,160 --> 03:49:33,540
He was literally hiding.

3341
03:49:35,300 --> 03:49:36,820
Don't be a jerk.

3342
03:49:37,260 --> 03:49:37,860
No, come on, Eva.

3343
03:49:38,320 --> 03:49:38,940
We gotta go.

3344
03:49:39,640 --> 03:49:40,280
Girl, we gotta go.

3345
03:49:40,900 --> 03:49:42,120
Okay, I'm just gonna...

3346
03:49:43,140 --> 03:49:43,700
Come on.

3347
03:49:44,020 --> 03:49:44,360
All right.

3348
03:49:44,560 --> 03:49:45,020
Pick you up.

3349
03:49:46,260 --> 03:49:47,320
Pick you up.

3350
03:49:47,540 --> 03:49:48,880
Pick you up.

3351
03:49:49,860 --> 03:49:50,200
Pick you up.

3352
03:49:50,580 --> 03:49:51,100
Pick you up.

3353
03:49:51,100 --> 03:49:51,640
Pick you up.

3354
03:49:53,680 --> 03:49:54,740
Okay, here we go.

3355
03:49:55,460 --> 03:49:55,940
Onwards.

3356
03:49:56,800 --> 03:49:57,180
All right.

3357
03:49:57,380 --> 03:49:58,380
Don't worry about it.

3358
03:50:24,480 --> 03:50:25,480
She might drown a little.

3359
03:50:26,300 --> 03:50:26,560
Okay.

3360
03:50:28,180 --> 03:50:30,900
This will make her really refreshed.

3361
03:50:32,100 --> 03:50:32,440
Probably.

3362
03:50:33,260 --> 03:50:33,920
Okay, hold on.

3363
03:50:35,960 --> 03:50:36,480
Uh...

3364
03:50:38,540 --> 03:50:39,060
Yes.

3365
03:50:39,560 --> 03:50:39,720
Yes.

3366
03:50:42,900 --> 03:50:43,860
Mud facial.

3367
03:50:44,500 --> 03:50:45,280
Exactly, exactly.

3368
03:50:46,620 --> 03:50:47,500
Okay, come on, Eva.

3369
03:50:48,060 --> 03:50:49,200
We're gonna go this way.

3370
03:51:03,100 --> 03:51:04,800
I'm gonna get a little snack real quick, though.

3371
03:51:05,420 --> 03:51:06,000
Don't mind me.

3372
03:51:10,930 --> 03:51:11,830
Where's that snake?

3373
03:51:12,370 --> 03:51:12,750
Here you are.

3374
03:51:13,970 --> 03:51:14,970
I got something.

3375
03:51:16,330 --> 03:51:16,510
Uh.

3376
03:51:17,410 --> 03:51:19,470
Just a little snack for the road.

3377
03:51:21,750 --> 03:51:22,250
Um.

3378
03:51:24,410 --> 03:51:25,050
I'll see.

3379
03:51:25,070 --> 03:51:25,690
anything else.

3380
03:51:26,130 --> 03:51:26,650
You're just kidding.

3381
03:51:30,330 --> 03:51:30,690
Alright, Deva.

3382
03:51:31,590 --> 03:51:32,190
Come on.

3383
03:51:37,100 --> 03:51:38,240
Eva is starving.

3384
03:51:38,460 --> 03:51:39,920
Eva is asleep.

3385
03:51:44,390 --> 03:51:46,210
I see some more rustling.

3386
03:51:46,650 --> 03:51:50,310
If I get to eat, then she can have whatever I have in my inventory.

3387
03:51:51,110 --> 03:51:51,790
It's a win-win.

3388
03:51:53,270 --> 03:51:54,050
It's a win-win.

3389
03:51:56,530 --> 03:51:58,030
What was here, anyway?

3390
03:51:58,030 --> 03:52:05,030
there was something here for sure i saw the bushes unless it was them birds

3391
03:52:20,000 --> 03:52:21,880

3393
03:52:53,240 --> 03:52:54,040
Ah hi!

3394
03:52:56,200 --> 03:52:57,720
I can get his butt from here.

3395
03:52:58,840 --> 03:52:59,940
I can't get his butt from here.

3396
03:53:00,700 --> 03:53:01,180
I didn't.

3397
03:53:01,320 --> 03:53:01,660
I didn't.

3398
03:53:01,780 --> 03:53:02,060
I didn't.

3399
03:53:02,680 --> 03:53:03,080
Uh.

3400
03:53:03,700 --> 03:53:04,100
Nowhere?

3401
03:53:08,640 --> 03:53:09,720
Oh no, she's awake.

3402
03:53:10,200 --> 03:53:10,580
Oh no.

3403
03:53:10,880 --> 03:53:11,720
Oh no, she's awake.

3404
03:53:12,500 --> 03:53:13,360
Oh no, she's awake.

3405
03:53:14,700 --> 03:53:15,500
How are you?

3406
03:53:15,640 --> 03:53:16,920
Oh, there we go.

3407
03:53:18,720 --> 03:53:19,160
Oh.

3408
03:53:23,890 --> 03:53:25,090
Saw another guy.

3409
03:53:28,210 --> 03:53:29,250
Where do you run to?

3410
03:53:31,630 --> 03:53:33,210
You want some food, Eva?

3411
03:53:33,790 --> 03:53:34,510
You want some food?

3412
03:53:34,750 --> 03:53:35,130
Come here.

3413
03:53:35,250 --> 03:53:37,350
I can grab.

3414
03:53:38,430 --> 03:53:40,050
Yeah, Eva, shut up, please.

3415
03:53:46,010 --> 03:53:48,030
We'll give you this mushroom.

3416
03:53:50,190 --> 03:53:51,010
My legs.

3417
03:53:51,350 --> 03:53:52,030
My leg!

3418
03:53:52,270 --> 03:53:53,070
My leg!

3419
03:53:53,250 --> 03:53:53,610
Shhh!

3420
03:53:54,690 --> 03:53:54,950
Shhh!

3421
03:53:55,570 --> 03:53:57,770
This one is tasted terrible.

3422
03:53:58,570 --> 03:53:59,190
Try it.

3423
03:54:00,610 --> 03:54:02,130
What did you give me?

3424
03:54:02,370 --> 03:54:02,950
Try it.

3425
03:54:03,110 --> 03:54:03,530
Try it.

3426
03:54:03,590 --> 03:54:03,810
Try it.

3427
03:54:03,870 --> 03:54:05,350
Try this one.

3428
03:54:06,830 --> 03:54:08,130
I'm gonna puke.

3429
03:54:08,610 --> 03:54:09,290
Try this one.

3430
03:54:10,130 --> 03:54:11,270
I do need some of these.

3431
03:54:14,190 --> 03:54:15,770
I've lost my appetite.

3432
03:54:26,790 --> 03:54:28,030
There was a guy.

3433
03:54:29,730 --> 03:54:31,190
Definitely lost him, though.

3434
03:54:33,090 --> 03:54:33,790
There was a third...

3435
03:54:33,790 --> 03:54:34,770
I saw him running.

3436
03:54:35,170 --> 03:54:36,090
Don't know where he is now.

3437
03:54:36,610 --> 03:54:37,070
That's okay.

3438
03:54:37,870 --> 03:54:38,070
Alright.

3439
03:54:38,510 --> 03:54:41,770
We continue onwards, and we need to go over there, I think.

3440
03:54:42,970 --> 03:54:43,150
Yep.

3441
03:54:51,140 --> 03:54:51,840
Oh, there he is.

3442
03:54:58,890 --> 03:54:59,290
Ah!

3443
03:55:06,890 --> 03:55:07,850
I'm over here.

3444
03:55:08,670 --> 03:55:09,710
Where the hell are you?

3445
03:55:10,150 --> 03:55:11,090
My camel's too good.

3446
03:55:11,770 --> 03:55:12,570
Wait, where the hell is she?

3447
03:55:13,530 --> 03:55:13,930
Eva!

3448
03:55:14,630 --> 03:55:14,910
Eva!

3449
03:55:14,970 --> 03:55:18,130
Oh my god, come here.

3450
03:55:21,230 --> 03:55:21,490
Come here.

3451
03:55:22,570 --> 03:55:24,010
Oh, she's so stupid.

3452
03:55:24,430 --> 03:55:24,950
Come here, please.

3453
03:55:35,900 --> 03:55:37,680
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

3454
03:55:42,580 --> 03:55:44,440
Even her snoring is loud.

3455
03:55:48,300 --> 03:55:49,880
Yeah, yeah, right there.

3456
03:55:50,780 --> 03:55:51,740
My snake.

3457
03:55:52,480 --> 03:55:53,400
Oh, that's so good.

3458
03:56:02,050 --> 03:56:04,710
Yeah, right there.

3459
03:56:04,710 --> 03:56:05,450
Yeah, right there.

3460
03:56:05,470 --> 03:56:06,130
Oh, boss.

3461
03:56:06,730 --> 03:56:07,870
That feels so good.

3462
03:56:10,110 --> 03:56:12,290
We love a bye queen.

3463
03:56:16,850 --> 03:56:18,070
Right there.

3464
03:56:18,890 --> 03:56:19,570
Fido.

3465
03:56:19,990 --> 03:56:20,930
That feels so good.

3466
03:56:21,270 --> 03:56:21,790
Fido!

3467
03:56:24,510 --> 03:56:25,070
The dog.

3468
03:56:29,610 --> 03:56:32,410
Yeah, Strange Love has some words about that.

3469
03:56:33,810 --> 03:56:35,250
I think she needs to wake up.

3470
03:56:35,270 --> 03:57:05,960
up though for we can just stomp on her what the dog doing wait I want to since we have her oh wait we could just take it out that's kind of fun all right wake up nice let's go actually am I in the right spot yeah come here come here

3471
03:57:20,740 --> 03:57:31,380
we made it want to stay croc for this yeah it's fine I'll still be sad probably

3472
03:57:37,740 --> 03:57:39,100
we're committed

3473
03:57:45,040 --> 03:57:46,420
guys this is it

3474
03:57:51,750 --> 03:57:54,710
come on snake come on snake

3475
03:58:02,000 --> 03:58:03,040
We made it.

3476
03:58:04,180 --> 03:58:05,120
But now you can run.

3477
03:58:07,480 --> 03:58:07,740
Yeah.

3478
03:58:08,320 --> 03:58:08,940
Over there.

3479
03:58:10,780 --> 03:58:11,220
Wow.

3480
03:58:14,240 --> 03:58:15,240
So inconspicuous.

3481
03:58:17,180 --> 03:58:18,160
It's the boss, isn't it?

3482
03:58:19,520 --> 03:58:21,200
I'll go get the wig ready to take off.

3483
03:58:22,360 --> 03:58:22,400
Okay.

3484
03:58:23,940 --> 03:58:24,440
Right.

3485
03:58:25,800 --> 03:58:27,100
I'll leave you two alone.

3486
03:58:28,240 --> 03:58:29,780
But come back in one piece, okay?

3487
03:58:37,740 --> 03:58:39,140
Promise me!

3488
03:58:46,550 --> 03:58:47,270
One piece.

3489
03:59:08,290 --> 03:59:09,210
Life's end.

3490
03:59:10,330 --> 03:59:11,070
Isn't it beautiful?

3491
03:59:13,250 --> 03:59:14,370
It's almost tragic.

3492
03:59:16,650 --> 03:59:19,530
When life ends, it gives off a final lingering aroma.

3493
03:59:21,790 --> 03:59:26,170
Light is but a farewell gift from the darkness to those on their way to die.

3494
03:59:27,630 --> 03:59:29,290
I've been waiting, Snake.

3495
03:59:29,750 --> 03:59:38,030
for a long time, waiting for your birth, your growth, and the finality of today.

3496
03:59:39,290 --> 03:59:42,670
Boss, why are you doing this?

3497
03:59:43,150 --> 03:59:43,490
Why?

3498
03:59:46,050 --> 03:59:47,770
To make the world one again.

3499
03:59:49,830 --> 03:59:51,430
The world used to be whole.

3500
03:59:52,930 --> 03:59:59,190
But with the end of the Second World War, the philosophers began to fight amongst themselves, and the world was torn apart.

3501
04:00:00,330 --> 04:00:05,750
The Cobra's my comrades who trained and fought alongside me were torn apart as well.

3502
04:00:07,570 --> 04:00:13,670
The foibles of politics and a march of time can turn friends into enemies just as easily as the wind changes.

3503
04:00:14,830 --> 04:00:15,970
Ridiculous, isn't it?

3504
04:00:18,610 --> 04:00:20,970
Yesterday's ally becomes today's opposition.

3505
04:00:21,750 --> 04:00:22,810
And this Cold War?

3506
04:00:24,490 --> 04:00:25,490
Think back.

3507
04:00:25,790 --> 04:00:28,930
When I was leading the Cobra's, America and Russia were fighting together.

3508
04:00:30,550 --> 04:00:36,590
Now, consider whether America and Russia will still be enemies in the 21st century.

3509
04:00:39,250 --> 04:00:40,450
Somehow I doubt it.

3510
04:00:41,490 --> 04:00:47,990
Enemies change along with the times, the flow of the ages, and we soldiers are forced to play along.

3511
04:00:51,470 --> 04:00:56,950
I didn't raise you and shape you into the man you are today, just so we could face each other in battle.

3512
04:00:59,750 --> 04:01:02,170
skills aren't meant to be used to hurt friends.

3513
04:01:04,590 --> 04:01:05,950
So then what is an enemy?

3514
04:01:07,870 --> 04:01:10,910
Is there such a thing as an absolute timeless enemy?

3515
04:01:12,910 --> 04:01:15,290
There is no such thing, and never has been.

3516
04:01:16,650 --> 04:01:19,850
And the reason is that our enemies are human beings like us.

3517
04:01:21,310 --> 04:01:23,910
They can only be our enemies in relative terms.

3518
04:01:26,070 --> 04:01:27,110
So pretty.

3519
04:01:27,150 --> 04:01:29,070
The world must be made whole again.

3520
04:01:30,010 --> 04:02:06,580
the philosophers must be reunited I will devote my skills to that purpose and with the Colonel's money I will achieve that end just as I once created the Cobras they are my family they were I may no longer be able to bear children but I still have a family it was November 1st 1951 I was in the Nevada desert participating in atomic testing.

3521
04:02:10,400 --> 04:02:12,980
The name Nevada is derived from Spanish.

3522
04:02:13,660 --> 04:02:16,140
Covered in snow, white as snow.

3523
04:02:16,660 --> 04:02:17,600
This music.

3524
04:02:19,060 --> 04:02:22,980
And snow is exactly what I saw in that Nevada desert.

3525
04:02:24,580 --> 04:02:26,480
It froze my blood white.

3526
04:02:29,740 --> 04:02:33,360
Snake, you were an atomic test subject, weren't you?

3527
04:02:33,640 --> 04:02:35,140
on Bikini Atoll.

3528
04:02:37,440 --> 04:02:39,500
That's part of the reason I was drawn to you.

3529
04:02:40,040 --> 04:02:41,120
You and I are alike.

3530
04:02:43,640 --> 04:02:47,340
We're both slowly being eaten away by the karma of others.

3531
04:02:49,580 --> 04:02:52,420
We'll never have the chance to die peacefully of old age.

3532
04:02:54,040 --> 04:02:55,600
We have no tomorrow.

3533
04:02:57,600 --> 04:02:59,860
But we can still have hope for the future.

3534
04:03:02,100 --> 04:03:07,400
In 1960, I saw a vision of the ideal future, from space.

3535
04:03:09,060 --> 04:03:17,660
Three years earlier, the Soviet Union had succeeded in launching Sputnik, the first man-made satellite in history, into orbit.

3536
04:03:19,120 --> 04:03:22,000
This came as a huge shock to the United States.

3537
04:03:22,560 --> 04:03:29,140
In response, America threw everything it had into its own manned spaceflight project, the Mercury program.

3538
04:03:31,280 --> 04:03:59,860
even as the Soviets seemed poised to send their first man into space America was still experimenting with chimpanzees and rockets the government wanted human data so they secretly decided to send a human being into space I was the one they chose at the time they didn't have the technology to block out cosmic rays.

3539
04:04:00,640 --> 04:04:04,380
And whoever they sent up would inevitably be exposed to heavy radiation.

3540
04:04:05,080 --> 04:04:06,100
That's why they chose me.

3541
04:04:07,040 --> 04:04:08,960
After all, I'd already been irradiated once.

3542
04:04:09,520 --> 04:04:11,940
Of course, you won't find any of this in the history books.

3543
04:04:13,420 --> 04:04:16,120
I could see the planet as it appeared from space.

3544
04:04:18,980 --> 04:04:20,200
That's when it finally hit me.

3545
04:04:20,940 --> 04:04:25,680
Space exploration is nothing but another game in the power struggle between the U.S.

3546
04:04:25,680 --> 04:04:26,500
and the USSR.

3547
04:04:27,480 --> 04:04:33,260
Politics, economics, The arms race, they're all just arenas for meaningless competition.

3548
04:04:35,260 --> 04:04:39,360
I'm sure you can see that, but the Earth itself has no boundaries.

3549
04:04:39,820 --> 04:04:42,640
No East, no West, no Cold War.

3550
04:04:44,580 --> 04:04:54,560
And the irony of it is, the United States and the Soviet Union are spending billions on their space programs and the missile race, only to arrive at the same conclusion.

3551
04:04:55,680 --> 04:05:04,500
In the 21st century, everyone will be able to see that we are all just inhabitants of a little celestial body called Earth.

3552
04:05:08,160 --> 04:05:13,240
A world without communism or capitalism, that is the world I wanted to see.

3553
04:05:16,000 --> 04:05:18,460
But reality continued to betray me.

3554
04:05:19,780 --> 04:05:20,500
Boss.

3555
04:05:22,000 --> 04:05:24,540
In 1961, I was sent to...

3556
04:05:24,560 --> 04:05:24,980
I know.

3557
04:05:25,860 --> 04:05:26,900
Tobias de Cucinos.

3558
04:05:30,120 --> 04:05:36,320
It was part of a CIA-sponsored invasion under the guise of taking Cuban exiles back to their country.

3559
04:05:38,360 --> 04:05:38,920
But the U.S.

3560
04:05:38,920 --> 04:05:40,220
government betrayed them.

3561
04:05:40,400 --> 04:05:43,500
Our weakening president held back their air support.

3562
04:05:44,380 --> 04:05:47,520
Defenseless, the exiles were annihilated by the Cuban army.

3563
04:05:48,300 --> 04:05:50,520
All I could do was watch in silence.

3564
04:05:54,560 --> 04:07:23,090
by the very country i'd sacrificed so much for by the very government i dedicated my life to defending i was driven from the surface world and i went underground what then two years ago i faced the sorrow my old comrade in battle he was my friend there he is but one of us had to die left with no choice he chose paper the sorrow gave his life for me what is there is no enmity between us one must live and one must die that was the mission the ones who gave me that mission were the philosophers early in the 20th century the true holders of power in the united states the republic of china and the newly formed soviet over like that gathered together oh i'm blocking the little kid be known as the wise men's committee the secret pact they formed there marked the beginning of the philosophers but the last of the original members died in the 1930s after that the organization began to run out of control and the wise men's committee degenerated into a mere shell of its former self the

3565
04:07:23,090 --> 04:07:32,410
philosophers of today have no sense of good Their influence extends to countries and organizations involved in every aspect of every war.

3566
04:07:32,450 --> 04:07:33,550
I'm the little kid now.

3567
04:07:34,610 --> 04:07:35,770
I'm baby boss.

3568
04:07:36,150 --> 04:07:37,370
That's how they operate.

3569
04:07:38,430 --> 04:07:41,390
The sacrifices of war cause a shift in the times.

3570
04:07:41,930 --> 04:07:46,090
This shift leads to renewed conflict and in turn triggers the next war.

3571
04:07:46,830 --> 04:07:54,610
Like a nuclear chain reaction, each conflict sparks countless others, forming an endless spiral that will continue on for eternity.

3572
04:07:56,790 --> 04:07:58,890
Do you understand what I'm saying, Snake?

3573
04:07:59,610 --> 04:08:05,210
By consuming me and you, the Philosophers intend to keep that cycle going forever.

3574
04:08:05,450 --> 04:08:06,030
Oh, there she is.

3575
04:08:07,330 --> 04:08:09,970
It was my father who explained all of this to me.

3576
04:08:12,930 --> 04:08:13,870
He was one of them.

3577
04:08:15,890 --> 04:08:20,110
You see, I am the last remaining child of the Philosophers.

3578
04:08:20,370 --> 04:08:20,810
Little baby.

3579
04:08:22,990 --> 04:08:52,890
but after he revealed the truth my father was killed by that same shapeless formless organization I got back and my father isn't the only thing the philosophers have taken for me in June of 1944 the Cobras and I took part in the landing at Normandy we'd been given a top secret mission to locate and destroy enemy V-2 rocket installations.

3580
04:08:55,090 --> 04:08:55,550
So cool.

3581
04:08:56,030 --> 04:08:57,570
I was pregnant at the time.

3582
04:08:59,470 --> 04:09:00,930
The sorrow was the father.

3583
04:09:02,890 --> 04:09:04,930
I gave birth on the field of battle.

3584
04:09:06,610 --> 04:09:08,030
A beautiful baby boy.

3585
04:09:10,010 --> 04:09:13,850
But my child was snatched away from me by the philosophers.

3586
04:09:14,650 --> 04:09:15,670
I'll never forgive them.

3587
04:09:16,810 --> 04:09:51,730
Actually, maybe he wouldn't be the crazy man he is a day if he wasn't snatched away you know what maybe look at the scar this is proof that I was once a mother botched job in my child for my country there is nothing left inside me now nothing at all no hatred not even regret and yet sometimes at night I can still feel the pain creeping up inside me,

3588
04:09:52,990 --> 04:09:57,790
slithering through my body like a snake.

3589
04:10:01,570 --> 04:10:04,710
Seasection by the worst surgeon ever, for real.

3590
04:10:05,970 --> 04:10:06,770
Thanks.

3591
04:10:08,230 --> 04:10:09,550
Thanks for listening to me.

3592
04:10:14,400 --> 04:10:15,400
I feel content.

3593
04:10:16,800 --> 04:10:17,100
Snake.

3594
04:10:20,540 --> 04:10:22,060
Commence the operation.

3595
04:10:24,860 --> 04:10:26,120
It has sex.

3596
04:10:26,300 --> 04:10:26,480
I raised you.

3597
04:10:27,700 --> 04:10:28,920
I loved you.

3598
04:10:29,300 --> 04:10:33,160
I've given you weapons, taught you techniques, endowed you with knowledge.

3599
04:10:33,740 --> 04:10:35,460
I could just listen to the boss talk, you know?

3600
04:10:35,480 --> 04:10:37,080
There is nothing more for me to give you.

3601
04:10:39,240 --> 04:10:42,240
All that's left for you to take is my life.

3602
04:10:43,020 --> 04:10:44,080
By your own hand.

3603
04:10:45,240 --> 04:10:47,680
One must die, and one must live.

3604
04:10:48,540 --> 04:10:49,960
No victory, no defeat.

3605
04:10:50,560 --> 04:10:52,720
The survivor will carry on the fight.

3606
04:10:53,500 --> 04:10:54,180
It is our destiny.

3607
04:10:54,180 --> 04:10:55,100
My voice is so nice.

3608
04:10:56,420 --> 04:10:59,620
The one who survives will inherit the title of boss.

3609
04:11:01,040 --> 04:11:07,120
And the one who inherits the title of boss will face an existence of endless battle.

3610
04:11:09,640 --> 04:11:11,560
I'll give you 10 minutes.

3611
04:11:11,940 --> 04:11:12,560
Oh gosh.

3612
04:11:14,060 --> 04:11:17,300
In 10 minutes, Migs will come and bomb the hell out of this place.

3613
04:11:18,460 --> 04:11:22,080
If you can beat me in less than 10 minutes, you'll be able to escape in time.

3614
04:11:24,480 --> 04:11:27,780
Let's make this the greatest 10 minutes of our lives, Jack.

3615
04:11:29,620 --> 04:11:29,640
Boss?

3616
04:11:30,600 --> 04:11:31,460
You're a soldier.

3617
04:11:32,220 --> 04:11:33,320
Finish your mission.

3618
04:11:34,920 --> 04:11:36,220
Prove your loyalty.

3619
04:11:37,920 --> 04:11:39,660
Yes, she is, Pearl from SpongeBob.

3620
04:11:40,320 --> 04:11:40,600
Face me.

3621
04:11:42,260 --> 04:11:42,720
Ah!

3622
04:11:43,760 --> 04:11:44,980
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3623
04:11:45,260 --> 04:11:46,520
Oh, are you out of your mind?

3624
04:11:47,060 --> 04:11:48,360
Sorry, I was trying to change.

3625
04:11:49,660 --> 04:11:50,740
Oh my gosh, wait.

3626
04:11:53,520 --> 04:11:55,440
She really gets you.

3627
04:11:57,920 --> 04:11:59,060
Heads up.

3628
04:11:59,180 --> 04:11:59,880
Okay, hold on.

3629
04:12:00,120 --> 04:12:01,040
I'm trying.

3630
04:12:03,180 --> 04:12:06,740
Look, we're covered in the white paddles.

3631
04:12:08,400 --> 04:12:09,220
Stop.

3632
04:12:09,520 --> 04:12:11,360
It actually does change.

3633
04:12:11,640 --> 04:12:11,980
No!

3634
04:12:14,100 --> 04:12:15,740
That's so...

3635
04:12:15,740 --> 04:12:16,920
Wee!

3636
04:12:19,420 --> 04:12:20,960
That's so wee.

3637
04:12:22,020 --> 04:12:22,520
Alright.

3638
04:12:23,500 --> 04:12:25,000
How we want to do this.

3639
04:12:26,200 --> 04:12:28,160
We can't see QC, though.

3640
04:12:28,980 --> 04:12:30,160
I could be a scientist.

3641
04:12:32,140 --> 04:12:32,660
There...

3642
04:12:32,660 --> 04:12:33,480
What is the...

3643
04:12:33,480 --> 04:12:36,240
There is a white one, but I didn't get it, I suppose.

3644
04:12:36,920 --> 04:12:38,180
We'll go with the chocolate chip.

3645
04:12:41,140 --> 04:12:42,120
Gold, yeah.

3646
04:12:42,480 --> 04:12:43,580
I gotta be gold.

3647
04:12:46,940 --> 04:12:47,460
Wait.

3648
04:12:49,860 --> 04:12:51,660
The iPatch is also gold.

3649
04:12:53,500 --> 04:13:25,880
a child it's so funny i mean yeah of course it would be but it's so funny um we'll go chocolate chip i think that might be our best option oh wait snow there it is duh yeah i was like i was confused if i had grabbed it or not um we won't go with spider i don't want our we don't have any food or anything so equip the book Would the Tuxedo make good camo?

3650
04:13:26,060 --> 04:13:27,830
It would if we could CQC in it.

3651
04:13:31,700 --> 04:13:33,240
I beat the game on European Extreme.

3652
04:13:33,340 --> 04:13:34,060
No special items.

3653
04:13:34,200 --> 04:13:35,020
I feel very accomplished.

3654
04:13:35,200 --> 04:13:36,520
And I beat the boss with just CQC.

3655
04:13:36,600 --> 04:13:37,440
Let's go, Charlie!

3656
04:13:38,640 --> 04:13:39,080
Nice.

3657
04:13:40,500 --> 04:13:41,680
Nice, nice, nice.

3658
04:13:43,960 --> 04:13:47,660
I'll miss having...

3659
04:13:47,660 --> 04:13:48,020
Yeah.

3660
04:13:50,540 --> 04:13:51,000
Ah!

3661
04:13:52,440 --> 04:13:52,900
Ah!

3662
04:13:56,660 --> 04:14:01,660
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

3663
04:14:01,660 --> 04:14:03,920
Boss, please.

3664
04:14:04,840 --> 04:14:07,460
Boss, let me just get ready, please.

3665
04:14:12,440 --> 04:14:13,480
Oh, gosh.

3666
04:14:18,340 --> 04:14:19,920
Don't look at me like that.

3667
04:14:21,300 --> 04:14:21,580
Oh!

3668
04:14:23,160 --> 04:14:24,120
I'm sorry!

3669
04:14:24,960 --> 04:14:25,460
I'm sorry!

3670
04:14:28,650 --> 04:14:29,230
Oh, my gosh.

3671
04:14:32,270 --> 04:14:34,010
Why am I so bad at the CQC?

3672
04:14:36,030 --> 04:14:37,470
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna die for real.

3673
04:14:38,790 --> 04:14:39,810
Thanks, she's so good.

3674
04:14:43,800 --> 04:14:44,080
Done.

3675
04:14:44,660 --> 04:14:45,060
That's okay.

3676
04:14:46,560 --> 04:14:48,120
Oh my gosh, I wasn't ready at all.

3677
04:14:50,200 --> 04:14:51,960
The Q is harder this time.

3678
04:14:52,820 --> 04:14:53,180
Golly.

3679
04:14:53,640 --> 04:14:53,860
Okay.

3680
04:14:55,040 --> 04:14:56,220
She called me pathetic, though.

3681
04:14:56,320 --> 04:14:57,000
That was kind of awesome.

3682
04:14:57,400 --> 04:14:58,480
Oh my gosh, I'm still the croc!

3683
04:14:58,720 --> 04:14:59,820
Are you out of your mind?

3684
04:15:02,720 --> 04:15:03,200
Oh my gosh.

3685
04:15:03,400 --> 04:15:04,720
Please, please!

3686
04:15:08,310 --> 04:15:09,370
Okay, okay.

3687
04:15:09,830 --> 04:15:10,050
All right.

3688
04:15:11,510 --> 04:15:12,370
Not good.

3689
04:15:13,590 --> 04:15:13,950
Oh, no.

3690
04:15:14,290 --> 04:15:14,710
There we go.

3691
04:15:16,610 --> 04:15:16,810
Okay.

3692
04:15:17,070 --> 04:15:17,330
All right.

3693
04:15:17,490 --> 04:15:17,950
We're fine.

3694
04:15:18,150 --> 04:15:19,030
I have a bone fracture.

3695
04:15:19,230 --> 04:15:19,690
No biggie.

3696
04:15:23,750 --> 04:15:26,070
They changed the CQC timing.

3697
04:15:35,520 --> 04:15:36,260
Where'd she go?

3698
04:15:43,580 --> 04:15:46,540
Oh my gosh, my tummy is growling like crazy right now.

3699
04:15:46,800 --> 04:15:49,720
There she is.

3700
04:15:58,890 --> 04:16:00,630
I also need to turn it down just a little bit.

3701
04:16:08,390 --> 04:16:10,290
You gonna come out?

3702
04:16:13,360 --> 04:16:16,640
Tessinka camp, you've only heard about in the middle of battle, was it very small?

3703
04:16:18,320 --> 04:16:19,040
Where is she?

3704
04:16:19,820 --> 04:16:21,940
She gonna come out?

3705
04:16:36,350 --> 04:16:37,530
Which tree was it?

3706
04:16:37,710 --> 04:16:38,010
This one?

3707
04:16:40,630 --> 04:16:41,230
Yes?

3708
04:16:42,430 --> 04:16:42,930
I think?

3709
04:16:44,710 --> 04:16:46,050
I might be crazy.

3710
04:16:47,930 --> 04:16:48,910
Who is this one?

3711
04:16:49,270 --> 04:16:49,450
Right?

3712
04:16:50,890 --> 04:16:51,490
Boss?

3713
04:16:54,430 --> 04:16:55,030
Boss?

3714
04:16:55,910 --> 04:17:00,250
I need to be aggressive because we don't have much time.

3715
04:17:01,530 --> 04:17:02,710
I made the CQC easier?

3716
04:17:03,850 --> 04:17:09,730
If you just let the boss beat you up until you get the slowdown, the prompt, okay.

3717
04:17:09,850 --> 04:17:10,650
Oh, there she is.

3718
04:17:10,790 --> 04:17:11,170
Oh my gosh.

3719
04:17:11,750 --> 04:17:11,850
Oh.

3720
04:17:13,150 --> 04:17:15,350
I was at the wrong tree the whole time.

3721
04:17:16,290 --> 04:17:17,270
That's so embarrassing.

3722
04:17:30,890 --> 04:17:33,170
So slow down, I see QC her.

3723
04:17:42,710 --> 04:17:43,070
Wait.

3724
04:17:48,950 --> 04:17:50,890
I don't know why I keep unequipping my gun.

3725
04:17:51,410 --> 04:17:53,450
I'm doing it because I'm like, oh, I don't want her to see me.

3726
04:17:53,630 --> 04:17:53,990
You know what I mean?

3727
04:17:54,870 --> 04:17:55,450
Oh, there she is.

3728
04:17:55,570 --> 04:17:55,710
Okay.

3729
04:17:59,640 --> 04:18:01,120
She went behind one of these trees.

3730
04:18:01,220 --> 04:18:01,520
This one?

3731
04:18:02,120 --> 04:18:02,660
This one?

3732
04:18:04,420 --> 04:18:04,920
One of them.

3733
04:18:06,600 --> 04:18:06,980
This one.

3734
04:18:14,780 --> 04:18:16,400
Shoot the exclamation point.

3735
04:18:16,580 --> 04:18:17,620
Is that like the...

3736
04:18:20,020 --> 04:18:20,420
Whoop!

3737
04:18:21,380 --> 04:18:21,820
Oh my gosh.

3738
04:18:24,460 --> 04:18:26,820
Okay, goes thank you for the 20 gifted.

3739
04:18:26,920 --> 04:18:27,840
Thank you so much!

3740
04:18:28,040 --> 04:18:28,400
Thank you!

3741
04:18:28,920 --> 04:18:29,600
Thank you, thank you.

3742
04:18:33,100 --> 04:18:34,440
I have gotten stronger.

3743
04:18:35,600 --> 04:18:36,640
Actually, I...

3744
04:18:36,640 --> 04:18:37,600
I don't know.

3745
04:18:37,620 --> 04:18:40,740
know why this feels much easier.

3746
04:18:42,180 --> 04:18:43,020
Oh, I lost her though.

3747
04:18:44,380 --> 04:18:45,320
I actually lost her.

3748
04:18:45,740 --> 04:18:46,260
Oh, there she is.

3749
04:18:46,700 --> 04:18:47,300
I didn't lose her.

3750
04:18:48,740 --> 04:18:50,280
Why is she not looking at me?

3751
04:18:53,220 --> 04:18:54,700
Okay, so slow down.

3752
04:18:57,000 --> 04:18:58,320
Never mind, I didn't get to slow down.

3753
04:18:58,860 --> 04:18:59,320
Okay, we're dumb.

3754
04:19:02,490 --> 04:19:03,050
Oh, nope.

3755
04:19:03,330 --> 04:19:04,050
Okay, I'm dumb.

3756
04:19:04,450 --> 04:19:05,130
I don't know how to do this.

3757
04:19:06,630 --> 04:19:09,250
I don't

3758
04:19:16,290 --> 04:19:17,570
CQC only please.

3759
04:19:17,810 --> 04:19:20,230
Yeah, we'll be here for five hours.

3760
04:19:24,310 --> 04:19:27,230
Oh, the disrespect.

3761
04:19:27,510 --> 04:19:28,050
There we go.

3762
04:19:33,250 --> 04:19:34,530
I would love to otherwise.

3763
04:19:39,520 --> 04:19:40,420
There she is.

3764
04:19:41,620 --> 04:19:43,900
I'm surprised the music hasn't started though.

3765
04:20:04,830 --> 04:20:06,950
I don't want to get her before the music starts!

3766
04:20:12,310 --> 04:20:13,370
I lost her.

3767
04:20:13,370 --> 04:20:15,610
I think

3768
04:20:25,140 --> 04:20:26,160
it's because I can crouch.

3769
04:20:26,380 --> 04:20:27,260
It makes it...

3770
04:20:27,260 --> 04:20:29,000
The crash walk makes everything so much easier.

3771
04:20:30,620 --> 04:20:31,040
Ugh!

3772
04:20:39,090 --> 04:20:39,370
Ah!

3773
04:20:44,020 --> 04:20:44,280
Gosh!

3774
04:20:45,060 --> 04:20:45,380
Oh my god.

3775
04:20:45,520 --> 04:20:45,780
Oh my god.

3776
04:20:45,880 --> 04:20:48,000
Run, run, run, run.

3777
04:21:13,760 --> 04:21:14,340
Oh shoot.

3778
04:21:14,920 --> 04:21:15,320
Don't come.

3779
04:21:15,480 --> 04:21:15,760
Don't come.

3780
04:21:18,210 --> 04:21:18,450
Don't come.

3781
04:21:18,710 --> 04:21:18,950
Don't come.

3782
04:21:19,130 --> 04:21:19,250
Don't come.

3783
04:21:19,630 --> 04:21:19,830
Oh

3784
04:21:25,520 --> 04:21:27,000
my gosh.

3785
04:21:29,040 --> 04:21:29,460
Please.

3786
04:21:29,620 --> 04:21:30,460
Please, boss.

3787
04:21:30,860 --> 04:21:32,200
Boss, be nice to me.

3788
04:21:32,320 --> 04:21:32,800
I'm your son.

3789
04:21:34,600 --> 04:21:35,540
Oh my gosh, I can't.

3790
04:21:35,680 --> 04:21:36,120
Oh, hello.

3791
04:21:37,640 --> 04:21:38,120
Gosh.

3792
04:21:38,940 --> 04:21:39,600
Gunshot wound.

3793
04:21:39,780 --> 04:21:40,380
In my fight?

3794
04:21:46,720 --> 04:21:48,360
Oh, bone fracture.

3795
04:21:48,940 --> 04:21:49,380
Of course.

3796
04:21:50,080 --> 04:21:50,840
Of course, of course.

3797
04:21:56,200 --> 04:21:58,160
Yeah, I can't have it equipped or she...

3798
04:21:58,160 --> 04:21:58,620
Oh my gosh.

3799
04:21:58,700 --> 04:22:00,200
I'm going to use a life heal.

3800
04:22:05,440 --> 04:22:07,300
I do have it in here, right?

3801
04:22:08,820 --> 04:22:09,300
Yeah.

3802
04:22:09,640 --> 04:22:10,460
Life medicine.

3803
04:22:15,740 --> 04:22:16,760
Why not?

3804
04:22:20,380 --> 04:22:20,960
Oh, please.

3805
04:22:21,280 --> 04:22:21,420
Move.

3806
04:22:27,930 --> 04:22:28,610
No.

3807
04:22:29,510 --> 04:22:30,050
Uh-oh.

3808
04:22:31,630 --> 04:22:32,510
I'm out.

3809
04:22:32,930 --> 04:22:33,230
Uh-oh.

3810
04:22:45,030 --> 04:22:46,650
I do have some grenades, y'all.

3811
04:22:49,330 --> 04:22:51,030
Where'd she throw the ammo?

3812
04:22:55,650 --> 04:22:59,270
I can't open my face.

3813
04:22:59,410 --> 04:23:00,050
Oh my gosh.

3814
04:23:00,210 --> 04:23:00,810
I completely forgot.

3815
04:23:01,830 --> 04:23:02,850
I don't have it.

3816
04:23:03,610 --> 04:23:04,010
Oh well.

3817
04:23:04,690 --> 04:23:07,450
Oh there she is.

3818
04:23:14,600 --> 04:23:16,240
I'm not going to be able to get her.

3819
04:23:17,740 --> 04:23:18,520
I got her.

3820
04:23:28,690 --> 04:23:31,150
Oh she's covered in drag tarts.

3821
04:23:33,050 --> 04:23:33,630
No!

3822
04:23:34,710 --> 04:23:34,930
No!

3823
04:23:36,210 --> 04:23:37,930
Oh, please, ma'am!

3824
04:23:38,350 --> 04:23:38,850
Please!

3825
04:23:39,630 --> 04:23:40,770
Where's all my stuff?

3826
04:23:42,290 --> 04:23:43,490
Oh my gosh.

3827
04:23:51,320 --> 04:23:52,300
Oh my stuff.

3828
04:23:52,540 --> 04:23:53,420
Where's all my stuff?

3829
04:23:54,100 --> 04:23:54,820
Where's all my stuff?

3830
04:23:55,720 --> 04:23:56,760
Where's all my stuff?

3831
04:24:03,080 --> 04:24:04,320
You're so rude!

3832
04:24:04,500 --> 04:24:05,300
Oh, I found something.

3833
04:24:05,820 --> 04:24:06,860
Oh my gosh, I found one thing.

3834
04:24:07,160 --> 04:24:07,520
Where is it?

3835
04:24:07,620 --> 04:24:08,020
Where'd it go?

3836
04:24:08,280 --> 04:24:08,640
Oh my gosh.

3837
04:24:08,740 --> 04:24:09,080
What do you mean?

3838
04:24:09,140 --> 04:24:09,980
I have to get it first.

3839
04:24:10,520 --> 04:24:11,080
Where's my gun?

3840
04:24:11,600 --> 04:24:13,600
Where's my gun?

3841
04:24:16,000 --> 04:24:17,180
This is pathetic!

3842
04:24:18,140 --> 04:24:18,700
This is pathetic!

3843
04:24:19,100 --> 04:24:19,260
There!

3844
04:24:19,540 --> 04:24:20,000
Is that my gun?

3845
04:24:22,120 --> 04:24:24,340
I didn't even get a chance to CQC.

3846
04:24:24,520 --> 04:24:26,920
I was trying to grab my gun!

3847
04:24:28,800 --> 04:24:29,200
No!

3848
04:24:29,200 --> 04:24:30,240
Where's my gun?

3849
04:24:32,740 --> 04:24:34,040
This is so bad.

3850
04:24:34,860 --> 04:24:35,760
I don't want to...

3851
04:24:35,820 --> 04:24:37,400
Oh, it's a cut.

3852
04:24:49,400 --> 04:24:51,780
Time is running out.

3853
04:24:52,360 --> 04:24:52,840
Thermals.

3854
04:24:53,160 --> 04:24:53,940
Oh, you're so right.

3855
04:24:54,660 --> 04:24:54,820
Wait.

3856
04:24:55,280 --> 04:24:55,640
And you know what?

3857
04:24:55,780 --> 04:24:56,840
I'm also gonna do.

3858
04:25:04,020 --> 04:25:04,940
Please, no.

3859
04:25:05,320 --> 04:25:05,540
Please.

3860
04:25:14,420 --> 04:25:16,460
Let me get it, please.

3861
04:25:17,800 --> 04:25:19,360
No, don't throw it.

3862
04:25:30,170 --> 04:25:31,690
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna live.

3863
04:25:31,830 --> 04:25:32,330
I'm not gonna live.

3864
04:25:32,410 --> 04:25:32,930
I'm not gonna live

3865
04:25:37,890 --> 04:25:42,190
To survive Oh shit

3866
04:26:16,880 --> 04:26:19,560
Take this keep it safe

3867
04:26:25,640 --> 04:26:26,600
We're rich

3868
04:26:39,820 --> 04:26:48,820
I didn't even see like a slowdown to do the secrecy.

3869
04:26:49,260 --> 04:26:49,880
I really didn't.

3870
04:26:52,260 --> 04:26:53,380
You're a wonderful man.

3871
04:26:53,460 --> 04:26:54,940
Like I didn't know when at all to click.

3872
04:26:55,620 --> 04:26:55,960
Kill me.

3873
04:26:56,460 --> 04:26:57,600
Kill me now.

3874
04:26:58,980 --> 04:26:59,960
Do it.

3875
04:27:00,200 --> 04:27:02,860
I think maybe...

3876
04:27:04,860 --> 04:27:07,500
After, I could try and, like, practice.

3877
04:27:13,080 --> 04:27:17,480
There's only room for one boss and one snake.

3878
04:27:20,720 --> 04:27:21,720
Happens during the animation.

3879
04:27:21,840 --> 04:27:22,880
The whole thing is an animation.

3880
04:27:23,060 --> 04:27:24,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

3881
04:27:26,480 --> 04:27:26,660
Oh.

3882
04:28:02,120 --> 04:28:02,640
Whig.

3883
04:28:17,900 --> 04:28:21,500
The fact that he's covered in blood, too, kind of makes it so messed up.

3884
04:28:22,300 --> 04:28:24,260
No, not our words.

3885
04:29:25,770 --> 04:29:26,210
Wee!

3886
04:29:26,210 --> 04:29:26,610
Wee!

3887
04:29:26,610 --> 04:29:26,750
Wee!

3888
04:29:36,890 --> 04:29:37,330
Wee!

3889
04:29:37,330 --> 04:29:38,250
I hate...

3890
04:29:38,250 --> 04:29:38,990
Well, no, wait.

3891
04:29:39,750 --> 04:29:43,230
I was gonna say I hate this next part, but no, no time to be sad.

3892
04:29:43,690 --> 04:29:45,630
We ha- wait, you guys, what should I pick?

3893
04:29:45,750 --> 04:29:46,950
The left or the right gun!

3894
04:29:48,050 --> 04:29:48,970
No time to be sad!

3895
04:29:50,110 --> 04:29:50,910
Ready to go, Snake?

3896
04:29:50,970 --> 04:29:52,230
This boy is coming back!

3897
04:29:53,910 --> 04:29:54,790
Oh, Snake.

3898
04:29:58,310 --> 04:30:06,790
someone give him a towel are you okay left

3899
04:30:13,170 --> 04:30:15,750
I pick left every time

3900
04:30:29,610 --> 04:30:39,790
I do get to keep it if I pick the right one that's true that is true okay here comes Fat-ass Ocelot to bring down the plane.

3901
04:30:39,830 --> 04:30:41,090
I told you you could trust me.

3902
04:30:42,990 --> 04:30:46,820
There can only three people can be on this ship.

3903
04:31:01,130 --> 04:31:01,870
Snake!

3904
04:31:05,680 --> 04:31:06,420
Ocelot.

3905
04:31:07,600 --> 04:31:08,860
We're not done yet.

3906
04:31:09,000 --> 04:31:10,000
Oh no.

3907
04:31:10,620 --> 04:31:11,940
No, you're never done.

3908
04:31:13,760 --> 04:31:14,380
Open up!

3909
04:31:16,580 --> 04:31:17,320
Damn!

3910
04:31:25,400 --> 04:31:26,600
Oh my god!

3911
04:31:34,500 --> 04:31:36,240
Don't do it.

3912
04:31:36,420 --> 04:31:37,300
Don't do it!

3913
04:31:42,420 --> 04:31:43,620
One of

3914
04:32:01,310 --> 04:32:02,450
us needs to get off!

3915
04:32:03,110 --> 04:32:03,610
Come on!

3916
04:32:03,790 --> 04:32:04,510
Eva, jump!

3917
04:32:26,060 --> 04:32:26,980
I'm asleep.

3918
04:32:27,380 --> 04:32:27,880
Just kidding.

3919
04:32:33,400 --> 04:32:34,260
We're too heavy.

3920
04:32:34,580 --> 04:32:36,720
Try to remember some of the basics of CQC.

3921
04:32:40,080 --> 04:32:41,700
That's stance.

3922
04:32:46,660 --> 04:32:48,820
Not good.

3923
04:32:50,040 --> 04:32:50,880
Uh-oh.

3924
04:32:56,870 --> 04:32:58,810
Ah, Salat, you're too fat!

3925
04:33:13,580 --> 04:33:16,240
They're just dancing at this point.

3926
04:33:16,780 --> 04:33:17,660
They love it.

3927
04:33:37,670 --> 04:33:40,210
I've picked up a few new moves.

3928
04:33:48,110 --> 04:33:55,030
It doesn't feel right to shoot an unarmed man, but I'll get over it.

3929
04:33:55,250 --> 04:33:55,750
Eva!

3930
04:33:58,690 --> 04:33:58,990
Oh!

3931
04:34:06,830 --> 04:34:07,510
Oh!

3932
04:34:08,150 --> 04:34:08,230
Oh!

3933
04:34:23,380 --> 04:34:24,060
Oh!

3934
04:34:24,080 --> 04:34:26,740
What do you say to one last showdown?

3935
04:34:29,640 --> 04:34:30,200
Yeah,

3936
04:34:34,840 --> 04:34:35,800
god they're just doing it.

3937
04:34:36,100 --> 04:34:52,880
The ship is the we're going down we're crashing but my ship be sailing The plane is you know the plane is the ship but also you know did I get it Talk

3938
04:35:22,880 --> 04:35:24,260
What's your name?

3939
04:35:28,490 --> 04:35:28,750
Snake?

3940
04:35:30,510 --> 04:35:30,950
No.

3941
04:35:31,650 --> 04:35:32,950
Not that name.

3942
04:35:34,810 --> 04:35:37,930
You're not a snake, and I'm not an Ocelot.

3943
04:35:38,370 --> 04:35:39,710
We're men with names.

3944
04:35:41,890 --> 04:35:43,370
My name is Adamska.

3945
04:35:44,890 --> 04:35:45,610
What's yours?

3946
04:35:47,270 --> 04:35:47,830
John.

3947
04:35:49,850 --> 04:35:51,710
Very well, John.

3948
04:35:53,710 --> 04:35:54,690
Plain name.

3949
04:35:56,750 --> 04:35:58,030
But I won't forget it.

3950
04:35:58,890 --> 04:36:02,350
John Snake.

3951
04:36:06,510 --> 04:36:06,990
Come on.

3952
04:36:07,950 --> 04:36:09,810
Guys, which one should I pick?

3953
04:36:11,470 --> 04:36:14,710
Oh my god, am I... I'm like dying for real?

3954
04:36:18,340 --> 04:36:30,220
Pick one up already Pick one up already Pick one Have you lost your nerve?

3955
04:36:30,700 --> 04:36:34,660
No What are you doing?

3956
04:36:36,840 --> 04:36:54,620
Oh Ah Pick one up already Right I think I did the left last time So we'll go with the right I think I did left the last time, so...

3957
04:37:03,480 --> 04:37:06,420
Yeah, this is the quote-unquote lore-accurate choice.

3958
04:37:44,220 --> 04:37:45,680
He got me.

3959
04:37:46,060 --> 04:37:46,840
Just kidding.

3960
04:37:52,290 --> 04:37:53,490
It's a blank!

3961
04:37:54,110 --> 04:37:56,590
Oh, that was fun.

3962
04:37:59,050 --> 04:38:00,010
It's a blank!

3963
04:38:05,220 --> 04:38:07,020
I love we just... That's not even his gun.

3964
04:38:07,780 --> 04:38:08,800
It's evas.

3965
04:38:15,160 --> 04:38:17,000
Just doing it for the love of the game.

3966
04:38:17,300 --> 04:38:18,560
Why did you even come back?

3967
04:38:18,900 --> 04:38:19,740
Because you're obsessed.

3968
04:38:19,760 --> 04:38:20,400
So we meet again.

3969
04:38:21,740 --> 04:38:22,140
John.

3970
04:38:36,730 --> 04:38:38,530
It's too good.

3971
04:38:40,410 --> 04:38:41,010
Snake.

3972
04:38:42,450 --> 04:38:43,770
Give me a hand.

3973
04:38:45,390 --> 04:38:45,690
Hold.

3974
04:38:53,030 --> 04:38:54,050
I love us a lot.

3975
04:38:54,050 --> 04:38:54,750
Come on, hold on.

3976
04:39:10,160 --> 04:39:14,620
Eva was just fighting for her life over there while we're dancing.

3977
04:39:18,020 --> 04:39:22,060
Oh, the blood's gone.

3978
04:39:29,240 --> 04:39:30,960
We made it.

3979
04:39:31,320 --> 04:39:32,840
Yeah, you sure did.

3980
04:40:02,260 --> 04:40:03,220
I know.

3981
04:40:03,400 --> 04:40:03,620
Oh no.

3982
04:40:03,940 --> 04:40:04,280
Mix!

3983
04:40:06,540 --> 04:40:07,660
You're so right.

3984
04:40:08,400 --> 04:40:12,340
He did chase down Snake to fire a blank and have a laugh before jumping out.

3985
04:40:12,940 --> 04:40:13,540
He's the...

3986
04:40:13,540 --> 04:40:14,540
There's no way out.

3987
04:40:14,580 --> 04:40:16,040
He's the toughest guy ever.

3988
04:40:16,940 --> 04:40:19,160
We've come too far to let them stop us now.

3989
04:40:22,960 --> 04:40:24,440
Those things have got to be all right.

3990
04:40:24,460 --> 04:40:26,560
Love can only move on the battlefield!

3991
04:40:32,500 --> 04:40:34,140
They're gonna shoot us down!

3992
04:40:35,100 --> 04:40:36,260
We were so close!

3993
04:40:36,960 --> 04:40:38,860
Weapons systems on now.

3994
04:40:39,300 --> 04:40:39,920
Locked on target.

3995
04:40:40,540 --> 04:40:41,880
I need more water.

3996
04:40:44,620 --> 04:40:45,520
You were great, Eva.

3997
04:40:48,580 --> 04:40:49,240
Thanks.

3998
04:40:58,070 --> 04:40:59,450
She's so pretty.

3999
04:41:01,110 --> 04:41:02,050
This is control.

4000
04:41:02,370 --> 04:41:04,630
Stand by for a direct order from the chairman.

4001
04:41:05,090 --> 04:41:07,070
Alt-19, return to base immediately.

4002
04:41:07,850 --> 04:41:09,030
Do you read me?

4003
04:41:09,410 --> 04:41:10,430
This is a direct order from...

4004
04:41:10,430 --> 04:41:11,370
Was she good?

4005
04:41:11,770 --> 04:41:13,370
Return to base immediately.

4006
04:41:13,710 --> 04:41:15,230
Alt-19, do you copy it?

4007
04:41:15,470 --> 04:41:16,190
Thank you, Robin.

4008
04:41:17,030 --> 04:41:17,590
Stock strings!

4009
04:41:17,790 --> 04:41:19,010
Thanks for the tag, get that!

4010
04:41:22,610 --> 04:41:23,170
Look!

4011
04:41:23,790 --> 04:41:25,150
The Migs are turning back!

4012
04:41:26,190 --> 04:41:26,510
Woo!

4013
04:41:31,310 --> 04:41:32,510
Oh my god.

4014
04:41:33,410 --> 04:41:34,550
Oh my god.

4015
04:41:37,430 --> 04:41:38,310
Anime moment.

4016
04:41:46,560 --> 04:41:47,400
Well done, Snake.

4017
04:41:48,020 --> 04:41:49,140
The MiG's disengaged.

4018
04:41:49,780 --> 04:41:51,320
Most likely under orders from Khrushchev.

4019
04:41:51,940 --> 04:41:53,180
Is this his way of helping us?

4020
04:41:53,560 --> 04:41:54,160
Who knows?

4021
04:41:54,580 --> 04:41:57,100
Maybe he didn't want things to get messier than they already are.

4022
04:41:57,440 --> 04:41:59,320
Or maybe he just wanted us to owe him one.

4023
04:42:00,000 --> 04:42:02,440
The important thing is, you made it out alive.

4024
04:42:02,840 --> 04:42:05,980
As long as Khrushchev is with us, I don't think they'll be coming after you.

4025
04:42:06,600 --> 04:42:08,660
It should be smooth sailing all the way to Alaska.

4026
04:42:09,220 --> 04:42:11,480
I'm sending someone out to Galena Bay to meet you.

4027
04:42:11,580 --> 04:42:12,320
To meet me.

4028
04:42:12,580 --> 04:42:16,580
Don't mind Teen Titans, Robin, VA telling Russian pilot gods to stand up.

4029
04:42:16,580 --> 04:42:17,440
Don't keep them waiting.

4030
04:42:18,020 --> 04:42:22,520
Wait, I didn't even realize that the pilot was gods.

4031
04:42:34,680 --> 04:42:36,520
Gotta go dog sledding.

4032
04:42:37,480 --> 04:42:37,640
Yep.

4033
04:42:39,360 --> 04:42:40,460
Oh, wait.

4034
04:42:43,140 --> 04:42:45,060
Oh my gosh, it didn't save.

4035
04:42:45,380 --> 04:42:48,200
It didn't auto save right before the boss fight.

4036
04:42:50,860 --> 04:42:51,660
Oh no.

4037
04:42:52,900 --> 04:42:56,040
I wanted to go back and try, you know?

4038
04:42:58,520 --> 04:43:00,860
Oh no, I should have saved myself.

4039
04:43:01,280 --> 04:43:02,500
Oh my gosh, imagine if I had...

4040
04:43:02,500 --> 04:43:03,540
Well, I guess...

4041
04:43:03,540 --> 04:43:05,080
If I had failed...

4042
04:43:05,080 --> 04:43:06,800
I wonder where it would have put us.

4043
04:43:07,220 --> 04:43:08,280
Go back to the KGB.

4044
04:43:09,820 --> 04:43:10,800
What do you want me to do?

4045
04:43:11,580 --> 04:43:13,360
Did you ever think about coming back to America?

4046
04:43:14,220 --> 04:43:15,260
I can't go back.

4047
04:43:15,760 --> 04:43:17,180
I've left America behind me.

4048
04:43:19,040 --> 04:43:20,600
But you saved this country.

4049
04:43:22,140 --> 04:43:23,660
I didn't do it alone.

4050
04:43:28,510 --> 04:43:29,310
And I still owe you a dinner.

4051
04:43:30,450 --> 04:43:32,070
Oh my gosh, no way.

4052
04:43:36,900 --> 04:43:38,500
Is that part of your mission too?

4053
04:43:39,960 --> 04:43:41,720
Or is it an order?

4054
04:43:44,680 --> 04:43:46,680
Or is it an invitation?

4055
04:43:53,710 --> 04:43:55,610
Or a proposal?

4056
04:43:56,010 --> 04:43:56,850
She's so close.

4057
04:43:57,490 --> 04:43:57,690
Oh!

4058
04:43:59,670 --> 04:44:02,590
I don't take orders from anyone, though.

4059
04:44:02,630 --> 04:44:04,050
I see your eyes.

4060
04:44:06,620 --> 04:44:08,700
I feel your pain.

4061
04:44:10,880 --> 04:44:17,520
I feel your sadness inside of me.

4062
04:44:18,940 --> 04:44:21,080
Whose house is this?

4063
04:44:22,720 --> 04:44:24,120
The wine!

4064
04:44:25,760 --> 04:44:27,480
I hope they're not mad.

4065
04:44:28,020 --> 04:44:28,920
Is this like an Airbnb?

4066
04:44:29,300 --> 04:44:31,120
The only one.

4067
04:44:31,920 --> 04:44:35,740
Afraid to fall in love.

4068
04:44:37,120 --> 04:44:39,340
Dance with me.

4069
04:44:40,600 --> 04:44:43,600
Walk this away.

4070
04:44:55,500 --> 04:44:56,180
Yeah.

4071
04:44:58,280 --> 04:45:00,220
How is he gonna get home?

4072
04:45:00,920 --> 04:45:01,160
Wait.

4073
04:45:02,780 --> 04:45:05,340
Wait, how is he gonna call someone to pick him up?

4074
04:45:07,620 --> 04:45:10,060
It tastes like wild beast.

4075
04:45:10,880 --> 04:45:13,400
The last thing I ate was...

4076
04:45:13,400 --> 04:45:15,120
What was it?

4077
04:45:16,460 --> 04:45:18,280
It was that snake on the ground.

4078
04:45:18,980 --> 04:45:21,040
Now I'm eating you.

4079
04:45:21,240 --> 04:45:22,020
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

4080
04:45:23,320 --> 04:45:24,520
Oh my gosh.

4081
04:45:24,660 --> 04:45:25,080
Kew!

4082
04:45:26,320 --> 04:45:26,700
Kew!

4083
04:45:29,300 --> 04:45:30,780
We're a little beat up.

4084
04:45:32,040 --> 04:45:32,920
A little bit.

4085
04:45:33,540 --> 04:45:34,780
We cleaned up the wine.

4086
04:45:42,090 --> 04:45:42,710
Video.

4087
04:45:42,730 --> 04:46:08,850
game kissing still awkward oh yeah we just uh it's like i feel like watching these scenes with you guys is like watching a sexy scene in a movie with my parents the snake in the book of genesis in that story it was eve who was tempted by the snake in the garden of eden but this time around wow vein these are veins i know they go crazy

4088
04:46:13,110 --> 04:46:34,390
he's a little he's a little beat up that's my fault oh why is he he's like duck lips he's like we are your parents yeah I get too embarrassed watching sexy scenes in front of you guys good

4089
04:46:52,170 --> 04:47:29,330
morning snake good morning snake oh first of all I have to apologize oh here comes the mysterious music i'm not a kgb spy and i never worked for the nsa i'm an agent of the people's republic of china for the general hq second department of the people's liberation army it was all a lie i tricked you and i'm sorry she

4090
04:47:40,110 --> 04:48:11,770
was a double triple spy the philosophers still exist in China too you see my mission was to find out where Volgan was hiding the philosophers legacy and steal it so I infiltrated his base as a KGB spy the two NSA codebreakers who defected in 1960 were actually both men the real Adam never showed up at the meeting place.

4091
04:48:11,910 --> 04:48:12,710
I wonder why.

4092
04:48:14,170 --> 04:48:16,750
Saving me the trouble of having to eliminate him.

4093
04:48:18,190 --> 04:48:20,270
I sneaked in by pretending I was Eva.

4094
04:48:23,130 --> 04:48:27,450
And you and Sokolov and Volgan, you all believed me.

4095
04:48:29,490 --> 04:48:34,590
The philosopher's legacy was originally held in common between the US, Soviet Union, and China.

4096
04:48:36,150 --> 04:48:38,850
We couldn't let the Russians and the Americans take it all for themselves.

4097
04:48:40,230 --> 04:48:42,630
The Chinese government had its eye on the legacy too.

4098
04:48:44,910 --> 04:48:46,630
I got the film containing the legacy.

4099
04:48:46,970 --> 04:48:48,010
Oh my god.

4100
04:48:48,630 --> 04:48:51,670
And also the nuclear missile launched data from the Shagohad.

4101
04:48:52,630 --> 04:48:53,670
Oh my god.

4102
04:48:53,890 --> 04:48:57,890
Five years ago the Soviet Union stopped supplying us with nuclear weapons technology.

4103
04:48:58,530 --> 04:49:03,150
Since then China's Leon Don easing hydrogen bomb and space rocket projects have fallen behind.

4104
04:49:03,990 --> 04:49:07,050
But with this data our country will be able to develop its own nukes.

4105
04:49:07,730 --> 04:49:39,410
We'll create a deterrent force to rival those of the US and Soviet Union everything has gone according to plan thanks to your help my poor guy is just being used all the time all the time I'm an agent of the philosophers a graduate of one of their charm schools I was raised in a joint US-Soviet Chinese facility to become a sleeper agent I could I could become a little more job there were collecting children from all over the world As a result,

4106
04:49:39,610 --> 04:49:41,930
I'm indistinguishable from a native-born American.

4107
04:49:42,790 --> 04:49:45,610
So it didn't surprise me when you and Vulgan couldn't tell the difference.

4108
04:49:47,450 --> 04:49:49,650
But she knew right from the beginning.

4109
04:49:51,010 --> 04:49:55,830
She knew because before the war, she was at one of the philosopher's schools, too, as an instructor.

4110
04:49:57,690 --> 04:49:59,590
The boss was the only one I couldn't fool.

4111
04:50:01,270 --> 04:50:03,070
She was the only one who knew I was a fake.

4112
04:50:03,070 --> 04:50:04,030
Cut them a recording and a check-in.

4113
04:50:05,550 --> 04:50:07,170
She told me everything.

4114
04:50:08,290 --> 04:50:38,750
I like why did she open her heart to me like that you're already a graduate I couldn't understand it but now I think I do snake she wanted you to know the truth she chose me to tell you that's why she saved my life I've lied to you so many times but not this time my orders from the government So many times.

4115
04:50:39,630 --> 04:50:39,650
Okay.

4116
04:50:41,130 --> 04:50:44,250
And to eliminate everyone who knew the truth about what happened.

4117
04:50:45,250 --> 04:50:48,090
In other words, I'm supposed to kill you.

4118
04:51:00,100 --> 04:51:01,160
But I can't do it.

4119
04:51:02,740 --> 04:51:04,200
Not because we loved each other.

4120
04:51:05,500 --> 04:51:07,340
And not because you saved my life.

4121
04:51:08,860 --> 04:51:11,700
But because I made a promise to the boss.

4122
04:51:13,300 --> 04:51:14,540
And I intend to keep it.

4123
04:51:14,820 --> 04:51:15,760
Thank you for the raid!

4124
04:51:16,220 --> 04:51:17,760
This is mega spoilers for the raid.

4125
04:51:17,820 --> 04:51:22,060
Metal Gear Solid 3 just in case anybody wanted to play.

4126
04:51:22,640 --> 04:51:23,920
Thank you so much.

4127
04:51:24,960 --> 04:51:28,460
We just live, Snake.

4128
04:51:30,520 --> 04:51:32,100
She puts the glasses on.

4129
04:51:32,180 --> 04:51:33,140
She looks like Maddie.

4130
04:51:33,360 --> 04:51:34,200
Oh my gosh.

4131
04:51:34,680 --> 04:51:35,380
So pretty.

4132
04:51:45,420 --> 04:51:47,020
What if you weren't listening?

4133
04:51:49,280 --> 04:51:50,080
Oh no.

4134
04:51:50,380 --> 04:51:50,740
Oh no.

4135
04:51:50,780 --> 04:51:52,860
Snake, listen to me.

4136
04:51:53,500 --> 04:52:12,040
she didn't betray the united states no far from it she was a hero who died for her country she carried out her mission knowing full well what was going to happen self-sacrifice because that was her duty

4137
04:52:15,820 --> 04:52:23,350
hi tyan

4138
04:52:29,370 --> 04:52:36,030
who's she Oh my goodness, who are you?

4139
04:52:36,810 --> 04:52:39,270
You are above even the boss.

4140
04:52:40,530 --> 04:52:44,090
I hereby award you the title of Big Boss.

4141
04:52:44,730 --> 04:52:46,670
It gets me every time.

4142
04:52:51,670 --> 04:52:52,750
Sorry, it's so funny.

4143
04:52:53,070 --> 04:52:54,190
You are a true patriot.

4144
04:52:58,170 --> 04:52:59,010
Uh...

4145
04:53:16,680 --> 04:53:17,400
Even

4146
04:53:20,590 --> 04:53:22,830
now he's thinking about him.

4147
04:53:36,920 --> 04:53:38,720
I don't shake that guy's hand.

4148
04:53:39,580 --> 04:53:40,840
Don't do it.

4149
04:53:41,520 --> 04:53:42,340
It's nasty.

4150
04:53:42,720 --> 04:53:44,300
Yeah, scowl at us.

4151
04:53:45,260 --> 04:53:48,260
That guy will remember this.

4152
04:53:48,540 --> 04:54:25,400
You know, unit like Fox in the army, someone like him to handle our top secret sneaking missions for us a man who combines the qualities of a soldier and an agent the boss's defection was a ruse set up by the US government it was all a big drama staged by Washington so they could get their hands on the philosophers legacy and the boss was the star of the show they played it so that they could get the legacy that Colonel Vulcan inherited and destroy the Shagohad at the same time time.

4153
04:54:26,920 --> 04:54:34,920
Only a legendary hero like the boss could have earned Vulcan's trust, finding out where the philosophers like his maiden was to be her greatest mission.

4154
04:54:35,840 --> 04:54:38,340
Everything was going according to plan.

4155
04:54:40,480 --> 04:54:42,820
But then something happened that no one could have predicted.

4156
04:54:43,760 --> 04:54:48,620
Colonel Vulcan fired an American-made nuclear warhead at Sokolov's research facility.

4157
04:54:50,720 --> 04:54:52,300
Khrushchev demanded that the U.S.

4158
04:54:52,300 --> 04:54:54,540
government provide proof that it wasn't involved.

4159
04:54:55,360 --> 04:54:58,320
They couldn't just abort the operation to steal the legacy.

4160
04:55:00,300 --> 04:55:03,460
So the operation itself was greatly expanded and revised.

4161
04:55:07,600 --> 04:55:15,660
The authorities in Washington knew that in order to prove its innocence, they'd have to get rid of the boss, and that one of their own would have to do the job.

4162
04:55:17,340 --> 04:55:20,740
The public couldn't be allowed to find out about it, not ever.

4163
04:55:22,540 --> 04:55:26,700
This, they concluded, would be the best way to keep the whole whole thing under wraps.

4164
04:55:27,360 --> 04:55:29,280
We're his best overalls.

4165
04:55:29,340 --> 04:55:31,420
The boss wouldn't be allowed to come back home alive.

4166
04:55:32,680 --> 04:55:34,500
And she wouldn't be allowed to kill herself.

4167
04:55:35,860 --> 04:55:38,800
Her life would be ended by her most beloved disciple.

4168
04:55:39,240 --> 04:55:41,080
Oh, the music gets me every time.

4169
04:55:42,040 --> 04:55:43,760
That was the way the government wanted it.

4170
04:55:44,640 --> 04:55:46,180
That was the mission she was given.

4171
04:55:46,800 --> 04:55:48,720
And she had no choice but to carry it out.

4172
04:55:50,320 --> 04:55:54,100
Her death at your hands was a duty she had to fulfill.

4173
04:55:56,200 --> 04:55:59,080
Out of duty, she turned her back on her own comrades.

4174
04:56:00,560 --> 04:56:03,240
A lesser woman would have been crushed by such a burden.

4175
04:56:05,620 --> 04:56:08,980
The taint of disgrace will follow her to her grave.

4176
04:56:12,060 --> 04:56:14,240
Future generations will revile her.

4177
04:56:16,780 --> 04:56:20,200
In America as a despicable traitor with no sense of honor.

4178
04:56:21,520 --> 04:56:24,520
And in Russia as a monster who unleashed a nuclear catastrophe.

4179
04:56:26,900 --> 04:56:31,500
She will go down in official history as a war criminal.

4180
04:56:33,460 --> 04:56:35,240
And no one will ever understand her.

4181
04:56:35,420 --> 04:56:36,240
That's true.

4182
04:56:38,340 --> 04:56:40,540
That was her final mission.

4183
04:56:40,640 --> 04:56:41,340
That is true.

4184
04:56:41,540 --> 04:56:43,220
No one will ever understand her.

4185
04:56:43,580 --> 04:56:46,100
And like a true soldier, she saw it through to the end.

4186
04:56:49,040 --> 04:56:53,800
But I think she wanted you, of all people, to know the truth.

4187
04:56:57,100 --> 04:57:20,020
She wanted to live on in your memory Not as a soldier I think it's kind of dangerous to leave a god here I guess kind of public We will understand her She was forbidden to tell you herself And that's why she told me

4188
04:57:23,900 --> 04:57:29,800
Snake History will never know what she did.

4189
04:57:31,840 --> 04:57:33,280
No one will ever learn the truth.

4190
04:57:34,800 --> 04:57:40,900
Her story, her debriefing, will endure only in your heart.

4191
04:57:42,500 --> 04:57:43,180
Sorry.

4192
04:57:47,580 --> 04:57:51,320
Everything she did, she did for her country.

4193
04:57:52,420 --> 04:57:55,660
She sacrificed her life and her honor for her native land.

4194
04:57:57,360 --> 04:57:59,580
She was a real hero.

4195
04:58:01,480 --> 04:58:04,360
She was a true patriot.

4196
04:58:29,120 --> 04:58:29,680
I

4197
04:58:33,060 --> 04:58:34,400
don't want to see him.

4198
04:58:35,720 --> 04:58:37,320
I don't want to see him crying.

4199
04:58:44,670 --> 04:58:45,050
Man.

4200
04:58:46,630 --> 04:58:47,650
1970, the U.S.

4201
04:58:47,750 --> 04:58:50,430
branch of philosophers changes its name to the Patriot.

4202
04:58:54,010 --> 04:58:54,850
Let's...

4203
04:58:54,850 --> 04:58:56,610

Yes, Grozny Grad and the Grannon Research Facility have both sort of wiped out without a trace.

4275
05:06:11,110 --> 05:06:11,530
No, sir.

4276
05:06:12,790 --> 05:06:15,970
I understand, sir, but they were necessary sacrifices.

Yes, sir.

4278
05:06:19,090 --> 05:06:22,110
Yes, the CIA has taken care of the boss themselves.

4279
05:06:22,870 --> 05:06:23,570

With this money.

4283
05:07:33,240 --> 05:07:35,460
Yes, the philosophers can finally be revived.

The film we handed the Chinese was a fake.

05:07:43,960 --> 05:07:46,480
Peking must be in an uproar right about now.

4288
05:07:49,720 --> 05:07:50,600
I'm afraid so.

4289
05:07:51,240 --> 05:07:53,540
Only half the money has made it back to the United States.

4290
05:07:56,720 --> 05:07:58,700
The KGB must still have part of the legacy.

4291
05:07:58,900 --> 05:07:59,380
Dun dun.

4292
05:08:01,920 --> 05:08:04,840
Yes, the weapon has been reduced to ashes.

4293
05:08:07,760 --> 05:08:08,620
That's right.

4294
05:08:09,820 --> 05:08:13,360
Grozny Grad has been obliterated by the Davy Crockett we brought in as well.

4295
05:08:14,800 --> 05:08:15,540
Grozny Grad!

4296
05:08:16,360 --> 05:08:18,900
Yes, that was the boss's work too.

4297
05:08:21,880 --> 05:08:26,020
Speaking of which, I've obtained something from Granin that you might find interesting.

4298
05:08:26,180 --> 05:08:26,760
This is so messy.

4299
05:08:26,780 --> 05:08:29,400
It's a revolutionary new nuclear attack system.

4300
05:08:30,360 --> 05:08:30,420
Uh-oh.

4301
05:08:30,720 --> 05:09:02,400
might just come in handy someday oh yes we have John I mean snake to thank for that sorry Khrushchev believe it as well he can't he can't stop thinking about his first name I don't think they'll be making a fuss the secondary alert has been lifted as well and the Soviets still haven't discovered my true identity they have no idea that I've been triple crossing them.

4302
05:09:03,140 --> 05:09:04,080
Triple crossing them!

4303
05:09:04,260 --> 05:09:04,980
But you...

4304
05:09:04,980 --> 05:09:07,940
I will continue my activities as a contact for the new government.

4305
05:09:07,940 --> 05:09:08,560
I saw that.

4306
05:09:11,440 --> 05:09:12,000
Yes.

4307
05:09:12,500 --> 05:09:15,180
It appears that no one knew that I was Adam.

4308
05:09:18,360 --> 05:09:19,580
Wow, wow, crazy.

4309
05:09:19,720 --> 05:09:20,120
Of course.

4310
05:09:20,660 --> 05:09:22,780
I'm always at the CIA's disposal.

4311
05:09:24,840 --> 05:09:25,540
Mr. Director.

4312
05:09:26,280 --> 05:09:27,420
Dumb, dumb, dumb!

4313
05:09:30,720 --> 05:09:31,000
No!

4314
05:09:36,040 --> 05:09:36,720
Whoa!

4315
05:09:39,060 --> 05:09:41,140
Like a boss, clear the game on any difficulty.

4316
05:09:41,900 --> 05:09:43,140
My title is Jack!

4317
05:09:43,740 --> 05:09:44,340
Oh no.

4318
05:09:46,120 --> 05:09:46,800
Jaguar.

4319
05:09:48,380 --> 05:09:49,060
Jag...

4320
05:09:49,060 --> 05:09:49,300
Jag...

4321
05:09:49,300 --> 05:09:49,560
Jag...

4322
05:09:49,560 --> 05:09:50,320
Jag...

4323
05:09:50,320 --> 05:09:50,840
Jag...

4324
05:09:50,840 --> 05:09:52,000
Jag...

4325
05:09:52,000 --> 05:09:52,480
Jag...

4326
05:09:52,480 --> 05:09:53,640
Jag...

4327
05:09:53,640 --> 05:09:54,040
Jag...

4328
05:09:54,040 --> 05:09:55,160
Jag...

4329
05:09:55,160 --> 05:09:56,120
Jag...

4330
05:10:00,860 --> 05:10:03,420
Such a fun game and a great remake too.

4331
05:10:03,420 --> 05:10:04,820
So thanks for letting us watch you freak out.

4332
05:10:05,080 --> 05:10:05,820
Thank you.

4333
05:10:06,500 --> 05:10:07,280
I took your advice.

4334
05:10:07,520 --> 05:10:08,680
Doki should be playing Delta soon.

4335
05:10:10,240 --> 05:10:14,360
I don't know if the brain rot will hit her, but you know, we'll see.

4336
05:10:16,700 --> 05:10:18,160
Humans killed four!

4337
05:10:21,120 --> 05:10:21,540
How?

4338
05:10:22,600 --> 05:10:23,300
Wait, how?

4339
05:10:23,800 --> 05:10:24,520
Wait, how?

4340
05:10:25,340 --> 05:10:27,160
Wait, what does this mean?

4341
05:10:27,260 --> 05:10:27,980
Hold on.

4342
05:10:28,180 --> 05:10:29,080
I look it up.

4343
05:10:30,420 --> 05:10:30,880
NGS3.

4344
05:10:34,560 --> 05:10:56,700
I don't know how to say this name this this animal you guys apparently say it wrong it was eva you think it was no way unless it counts the four bosses

4345
05:10:59,780 --> 05:11:15,200
oh wait here we go beat the game with 50 or less continues 36 or more alerts and a hundred or less kills how many alerts did I have I'm one over

4346
05:11:18,230 --> 05:11:25,870
buy it oh it's 36 or more so two no way easy

4347
05:11:30,410 --> 05:11:44,170
I wonder what I would have got another was oh wait maybe uh no Because there's Leopard, which has beat the game with 51 or more continues.

4348
05:11:44,510 --> 05:11:47,290
Who's beating the game with 51 continues?

4349
05:11:48,750 --> 05:11:52,450
36 or more alerts or 100 or less people killed.

4350
05:11:52,730 --> 05:11:53,910
Oh, my gosh.

4351
05:11:53,950 --> 05:11:54,530
Oh, she's...

4352
05:11:54,530 --> 05:11:55,370
Thank you.

4353
05:11:56,590 --> 05:11:57,410
Gonna have to watch the mod.

4354
05:11:57,530 --> 05:12:00,230
I hope you enjoyed the remake as much as it did the first time you played the original.

4355
05:12:00,590 --> 05:12:02,710
I'm assuming you played the original before.

4356
05:12:04,930 --> 05:12:06,090
No, I've never played it.

4357
05:12:13,670 --> 05:12:14,250
Wait...

4358
05:12:14,250 --> 05:12:16,270
Wait, I should have...

4359
05:12:16,270 --> 05:12:18,270
You guys...

4360
05:12:18,270 --> 05:12:20,230
I'm so upset right now.

4361
05:12:21,030 --> 05:12:22,430
There's a title leech.

4362
05:12:23,450 --> 05:12:26,360
And it's you beat the game with a leech attached to your body.

4363
05:12:32,040 --> 05:12:33,160
Title leech!

4364
05:12:39,500 --> 05:12:42,060
I think he got the same title you did.

4365
05:12:44,560 --> 05:12:45,780
Oh, yippee!

4366
05:12:46,440 --> 05:12:47,660
That means we got the same.

4367
05:12:48,020 --> 05:12:49,060
The face went, Vinky.

4368
05:12:49,160 --> 05:12:50,060
Yeah, we got the same.

4369
05:12:51,520 --> 05:12:52,080
Let's see.

4370
05:12:53,300 --> 05:12:56,180
I wonder what I would have had if my alert phase was down.

4371
05:12:58,140 --> 05:12:59,260
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4372
05:12:59,300 --> 05:12:59,600
Oh, no.

4373
05:12:59,800 --> 05:13:00,480
Centipede, no.

4374
05:13:01,020 --> 05:13:04,280
That's 51 or more continues, but 35 or less alerts.

4375
05:13:09,460 --> 05:13:11,240
Chameleon beat the game with no alerts.

4376
05:13:11,420 --> 05:13:12,000
That's insane.

4377
05:13:14,520 --> 05:13:14,840
Huh.

4378
05:13:16,500 --> 05:13:16,920
Hmm.

4379
05:13:20,490 --> 05:13:21,710
What'd I get?

4380
05:13:24,250 --> 05:13:25,710
The Patriot.

4381
05:13:26,190 --> 05:13:26,570
Camera.

4382
05:13:27,370 --> 05:13:28,390

4383
05:13:28,750 --> 05:13:29,690
Brown face paint.

4384
05:13:29,890 --> 05:13:30,590
Taxido!

4385
05:13:31,310 --> 05:13:31,750
Banana.

4386
05:13:33,030 --> 05:13:33,790
DPM.

4387
05:13:34,970 --> 05:13:35,730

05:13:36,230 --> 05:13:37,130
Desert Tiger.

4389
05:13:37,490 --> 05:13:38,170
Flectarn.

4390
05:13:38,670 --> 05:13:40,130
National flag face paints.

4391
05:13:40,570 --> 05:13:40,950
Mummy!

4392
05:13:43,150 --> 05:13:43,910
Grenade!

4393
05:13:44,030 --> 05:13:45,270
Yeah, the grenade camo.

4394
05:13:45,490 --> 05:13:45,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4395
05:13:46,630 --> 05:13:47,450
Reward camo.

4396
05:13:47,890 --> 05:13:48,670
Oh my gosh.

4397
05:13:49,210 --> 05:13:49,770
We can be...

4398
05:13:49,790 --> 05:13:50,310
What?

4399
05:13:50,470 --> 05:13:51,670
The hearts are so cute.

4400
05:13:52,290 --> 05:13:53,210
Demo theater!

4401
05:13:53,750 --> 05:13:54,370
Secret theater!

4402
05:13:54,830 --> 05:13:55,810

05:13:56,550 --> 05:13:57,470
Character viewer.

4404
05:14:02,030 --> 05:14:03,630
Will they fall in love with me?

4405
05:14:04,330 --> 05:14:05,070
If I wear that?

4406
05:14:07,830 --> 05:14:08,130
Tear.

4407
05:14:10,210 --> 05:14:10,570
Ah.

4408
05:14:12,530 --> 05:14:13,110
Ah.

4409
05:14:16,320 --> 05:14:16,900
Ah.

4410
05:14:18,300 --> 05:14:19,960
Are there any new secret theater?

4411
05:14:20,100 --> 05:14:21,160
Apparently there are.

4412
05:14:21,820 --> 05:14:22,480
Hello, game.

4413
05:14:23,120 --> 05:14:23,560
Oh, there we go.

4414
05:14:24,960 --> 05:14:27,920
Um, I'm gonna have you guys listen to this and I'm gonna go get some more water.

4415
05:14:29,620 --> 05:14:30,660
Really hungry though.

4416
05:14:31,480 --> 05:14:34,600
We will watch some secret secret theater, but I don't know if I'll get the people.

4417
05:14:34,820 --> 05:14:35,480
I'm so sorry.

4418
05:14:35,720 --> 05:14:37,740
D'Orgo, thank you so much for the food, D'Orgo.

4419
05:14:38,620 --> 05:14:39,260
Thank you.

4420
05:14:39,300 --> 05:14:39,860
Thank you.

4421
05:14:39,960 --> 05:14:41,000
I'm just so hungry.

4422
05:14:42,140 --> 05:14:43,560
Then I have to go out and get food.

4423
05:14:43,760 --> 05:14:44,320
I don't know what I mean.

4424
05:14:44,860 --> 05:14:46,260
Um, just one second, I'm gonna go get water.

4425
05:14:54,380 --> 05:14:57,540
I'm searching and I'll melt into you.

4426
05:14:59,420 --> 05:15:12,340
What a fear in my heart But you're so supreme I give my love

4427
05:15:21,680 --> 05:15:24,980
My time

4428
05:15:37,480 --> 05:15:49,480
To you I'm still in a dream Snake eater

4429
05:15:53,390 --> 05:16:23,860
Someday you go through the rain And someday you feed on a tree frog This ordeal, the trial to survive For the day we see new life Not for honor, but for honor you.

4430
05:16:26,580 --> 05:16:37,080
In my time, there'll be no one else.

4431
05:16:38,180 --> 05:16:45,320
Crime, it's the way I fly to you.

4432
05:16:47,980 --> 05:16:55,140
I'm still in a dream Snake ita

4433
05:17:00,520 --> 05:17:11,600
But I'm still When I dream Snake ita

4434
05:17:15,460 --> 05:17:27,880
Snake ita Snakea Oh no What the hell?

4435
05:17:27,960 --> 05:17:28,400
No!

4436
05:17:34,190 --> 05:17:36,570
This is so messed up!

4437
05:17:38,430 --> 05:17:38,510
Oh!

4438
05:17:45,880 --> 05:17:48,260
This is so messed up.

4439
05:17:48,980 --> 05:17:50,460
No horse.

4440
05:17:51,580 --> 05:17:51,980
No.

4441
05:17:57,520 --> 05:17:59,340
The 3DS version does this too?

4442
05:17:59,760 --> 05:18:00,500
No way.

4443
05:18:00,680 --> 05:18:01,000
Really?

4444
05:18:01,600 --> 05:18:03,760
I never beat the 3DS one, so...

4445
05:18:15,430 --> 05:18:16,810
You can hear him.

4446
05:18:17,790 --> 05:18:19,770
You can hear he's like...

4447
05:18:20,870 --> 05:18:22,450
Oh my gosh.

4448
05:18:23,770 --> 05:18:24,790
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4449
05:18:24,790 --> 05:18:25,310
We have this to do it.

4450
05:18:25,410 --> 05:18:25,610
It's okay.

4451
05:18:25,750 --> 05:18:25,970
It's okay.

4452
05:18:28,210 --> 05:18:30,170
Alright, let's do some...

4453
05:18:30,730 --> 05:18:31,690
Oh, that hurts.

4454
05:18:33,810 --> 05:18:36,250
Oh, that's what the question mark was for Guy...

4455
05:18:36,250 --> 05:18:38,670
I thought it was for Secret Theater, but it's for Guy Savage.

4456
05:18:41,110 --> 05:18:42,070
I kind of.

4457
05:18:42,390 --> 05:18:43,270
I think...

4458
05:18:44,170 --> 05:18:46,270
Well, people knew about it beforehand.

4459
05:18:46,810 --> 05:18:48,050
But then they also tweeted about it.

4460
05:18:48,110 --> 05:18:49,310
I wish they had kept it a secret.

4461
05:18:49,570 --> 05:18:50,170
So that...

4462
05:18:52,170 --> 05:18:54,110
So that the question mark would be like, Huh?

4463
05:18:54,170 --> 05:18:54,750
What's that for?

4464
05:18:56,390 --> 05:18:57,190
Secret theater!

4465
05:19:06,870 --> 05:19:07,310
Huh?

4466
05:19:15,550 --> 05:19:19,290
Wait, I thought it said all unlocked after the end of the game.

4467
05:19:20,110 --> 05:19:22,670
Wait, I still actually have to get them from everybody?

4468
05:19:26,090 --> 05:19:29,490
I still had to get the I would have actually...

4469
05:19:29,490 --> 05:19:33,000
I thought the whole thing unlocked once you made it.

4470
05:19:38,890 --> 05:19:40,050
No way!

4471
05:19:40,530 --> 05:19:42,910
They just meant the actual thing unlocked.

4472
05:19:43,250 --> 05:19:44,250
Not the actual thing.

4473
05:19:46,370 --> 05:19:46,950
No.

4474
05:19:47,070 --> 05:19:47,410
Oh, wait.

4475
05:19:47,490 --> 05:19:48,750
This still is the same, too.

4476
05:19:48,830 --> 05:19:49,770
This is so cute.

4477
05:19:51,050 --> 05:19:53,970
Wait, can we do sexy time with like...

4478
05:19:53,970 --> 05:19:54,470
Wait.

4479
05:19:56,230 --> 05:19:57,390
Stripping Rycom.

4480
05:19:58,010 --> 05:19:59,910
Wait, can we change it?

4481
05:20:00,610 --> 05:20:02,150
Can we change the sexy time?

4482
05:20:07,330 --> 05:20:08,830
Wait, why can't I do sexy time?

4483
05:20:10,170 --> 05:20:11,250
Ocelot wins.

4484
05:20:11,430 --> 05:20:12,590
Wait, where is the sexy time?

4485
05:20:13,150 --> 05:20:13,910
Maybe it's over here.

4486
05:20:14,890 --> 05:20:15,690
Where's sexy time?

4487
05:20:16,010 --> 05:20:16,570
Sexy time?

4488
05:20:18,170 --> 05:20:19,510
Where is it?

4489
05:20:24,710 --> 05:20:26,470
Where is sexy time?

4490
05:20:28,410 --> 05:20:30,290
Why is this one...

4491
05:20:32,570 --> 05:20:34,370
Why are some of these...

4492
05:20:37,230 --> 05:20:38,510
Some of these are locked.

4493
05:20:40,150 --> 05:20:41,150
I was on it.

4494
05:20:48,660 --> 05:20:51,320
No, not removing the transmitter, the very end of the game.

4495
05:20:51,600 --> 05:20:52,340
Oh, we could do this one.

4496
05:20:52,440 --> 05:20:53,200
We could do that one.

4497
05:20:53,740 --> 05:20:54,340
Where was that?

4498
05:20:54,420 --> 05:20:54,780
This one?

4499
05:20:56,800 --> 05:20:57,920
Wait, can I change the people?

4500
05:20:58,140 --> 05:21:00,620
Oh, it doesn't seem like it.

4501
05:21:01,120 --> 05:21:01,520
Dang.

4502
05:21:02,420 --> 05:21:03,720
Get me out of here.

4503
05:21:06,580 --> 05:21:07,380
Oh, dang.

4504
05:21:10,100 --> 05:21:12,580
There's still a new secret theater you can watch at the top.

4505
05:21:12,720 --> 05:21:14,200
Yeah, that's what I was about to do.

4506
05:21:14,260 --> 05:21:15,260
Oh, just kidding.

4507
05:21:15,620 --> 05:21:16,000
Let me out.

4508
05:21:22,460 --> 05:21:22,860
Okay.

4509
05:21:23,280 --> 05:21:24,740
We'll watch this one then.

4510
05:21:28,360 --> 05:21:29,520
Oh, my ears.

4511
05:21:29,740 --> 05:21:30,400
Oh, my gosh.

4512
05:21:37,140 --> 05:21:38,260
Keeps going through the same.

4513
05:21:38,580 --> 05:21:40,100
Door, what is this, PT?

4514
05:21:43,860 --> 05:21:50,760
So Secret Theater is a lot of fun because it just makes every cutscene silly.

4515
05:21:54,990 --> 05:21:57,030
So we'll see what silliness happens here.

4516
05:22:01,770 --> 05:22:06,270
I haven't seen any of the new Delta ones, so this is completely new for me.

4517
05:22:09,170 --> 05:22:10,750
Ship posting in 2004.

4518
05:22:12,490 --> 05:22:14,270
Why is Sokolov...

4519
05:22:15,710 --> 05:22:18,650
Wait, Sokolov is super saiyan?

4520
05:22:20,070 --> 05:22:21,310
Good work, Jack.

4521
05:22:22,590 --> 05:22:23,530
What are you doing here?

4522
05:22:23,850 --> 05:22:25,610
Sokolov comes with me.

4523
05:22:34,240 --> 05:22:38,200
I guess for these, they would have to have recorded new lines maybe.

4524
05:22:40,860 --> 05:22:41,420
As well.

4525
05:22:43,020 --> 05:22:43,760
So that's fun.

4526
05:22:44,640 --> 05:23:09,900
my friends my friends let us fight together again I have waited long for this day we will fight with you once more oh yeah welcome back boss now that all why doesn't fury say anything it's time we go to the depths of hell itself

4527
05:23:17,600 --> 05:23:18,740
He's too angry.

4528
05:23:20,180 --> 05:23:21,840
Alright, so we'll have the weird thing.

4529
05:24:11,140 --> 05:24:12,960
Oh my god.

4530
05:24:15,300 --> 05:24:15,680
No!

4531
05:24:16,060 --> 05:24:18,500
Do you think this one is a continuation of...

4532
05:24:19,860 --> 05:24:21,360
of the one where... Oh!

4533
05:24:21,960 --> 05:24:24,020
They didn't remake them.

4534
05:24:26,660 --> 05:24:27,980
That's so interesting!

4535
05:24:29,340 --> 05:24:31,400
They're the original cutscenes!

4536
05:24:31,900 --> 05:24:39,860
They didn't remake them, they just added them, which is so nice.

4537
05:24:42,860 --> 05:24:48,100
Do you think this is a sequel to the guy that didn't get his hands shaken?

4538
05:24:49,640 --> 05:24:52,360
Oh my gosh, I have to go find all of them.

4539
05:24:54,600 --> 05:24:55,760
Wait, which one is this?

4540
05:24:55,780 --> 05:25:00,900
one where his hand doesn't get it right cat-like behavior

4541

I'm getting spoiled.

4547
05:26:08,560 --> 05:26:09,460
Okay, one moment, please.

4548
05:26:09,640 --> 05:26:10,140
One moment.

4549
05:26:11,160 --> 05:26:11,740
One moment.

4550
05:26:11,840 --> 05:26:12,380
One moment.

4551
05:26:13,080 --> 05:26:14,240
Okay, this IGN.

4552
05:26:14,440 --> 05:26:14,900
Okay, hold on.

4553
05:26:15,020 --> 05:26:16,020
I have to...

4554
05:26:16,020 --> 05:26:17,480
We'll skip the first one.

4555
05:26:18,380 --> 05:26:18,560
Okay.

4556
05:26:19,160 --> 05:26:21,380
Wow, this is quite long, I think.

4557
05:26:22,820 --> 05:26:23,220
Okay.

4558
05:26:25,340 --> 05:26:27,400
Unlocks after completing the story.

4559
05:26:30,220 --> 05:26:30,820
Okay.

4560
05:26:32,460 --> 05:26:33,600
is safe with us, Minto.

4561
05:26:33,960 --> 05:26:34,540
Thank you.

4562
05:26:40,730 --> 05:26:43,890
Okay, now I do window capture.

4563
05:26:49,650 --> 05:26:50,690
This one?

4564
05:26:52,490 --> 05:26:52,850
Uh.

4565
05:26:58,190 --> 05:26:59,190
Like that.

4566
05:26:59,370 --> 05:27:00,490
Okay, that should be good.

4567
05:27:01,670 --> 05:27:02,010
Oh, wait.

4568
05:27:02,110 --> 05:27:02,490
My bad.

4569
05:27:02,650 --> 05:27:03,350
There we go.

4570
05:27:03,750 --> 05:27:03,750
Okay.

4571
05:27:06,730 --> 05:27:07,530
Okie dokie.

4572
05:27:08,010 --> 05:27:08,530
That should be good.

4573
05:27:08,550 --> 05:27:09,790
fit the screen.

4574
05:27:12,310 --> 05:27:14,070
Okay, so this is the second one.

4575
05:27:16,550 --> 05:27:18,190
Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

4576
05:27:19,290 --> 05:27:20,870
I just realized I didn't have the audio on.

4577
05:27:21,110 --> 05:27:21,830
Okay, one second.

4578
05:27:21,950 --> 05:27:22,290
There we go.

4579
05:27:23,290 --> 05:27:24,030
Oh, my ears.

4580
05:27:24,350 --> 05:27:24,550
I could have.

4581
05:27:24,770 --> 05:27:25,030
Sorry.

4582
05:27:25,330 --> 05:27:25,710
I got you.

4583
05:27:26,990 --> 05:27:27,950
So what's this part?

4584
05:27:29,330 --> 05:27:30,290
Wait, that's not Vulcan.

4585
05:27:31,050 --> 05:27:32,110
Who's walking in?

4586
05:27:39,360 --> 05:27:40,180
My god!

4587
05:27:41,040 --> 05:27:42,160
Gran and Ryzen!

4588
05:27:45,800 --> 05:27:48,740
You're the intruder everyone's talking about.

4589
05:27:49,320 --> 05:27:49,340
No!

4590
05:27:52,100 --> 05:27:54,500
He's, like, so messed up.

4591
05:28:07,140 --> 05:28:08,520
Oh, my God.

4592
05:28:08,980 --> 05:28:09,420
Who, uh...

4593
05:28:09,420 --> 05:28:10,560
Put that thing away.

4594
05:28:10,840 --> 05:28:12,100
You'll spoil my drink.

4595
05:28:14,260 --> 05:28:15,280
It's him.

4596
05:28:17,440 --> 05:28:20,380
Are they just splicing lines?

4597
05:28:22,580 --> 05:28:24,560
It's him you're looking for, isn't it?

4598
05:28:26,480 --> 05:28:27,600
What is happening?

4599
05:28:28,360 --> 05:28:29,920
I have been stripped of my authority.

4600
05:28:30,520 --> 05:28:32,780
My research has come to nothing.

4601
05:28:34,220 --> 05:28:35,680
Tank does not need a rocket.

4602
05:28:36,520 --> 05:28:38,500
It needs something else.

4603
05:28:41,660 --> 05:28:42,300
Legs.

4604
05:28:42,400 --> 05:28:43,160
What is happening?

4605
05:28:43,380 --> 05:28:43,560
Oh.

4606
05:28:44,400 --> 05:28:46,800
He just shot his legs.

4607
05:28:47,340 --> 05:28:49,360
Oh, we missed the nice shoes.

4608
05:28:50,820 --> 05:28:50,940
Oh.

4609
05:28:54,860 --> 05:28:58,100
This looks like a randomizer mod cutscene.

4610
05:28:58,340 --> 05:28:59,580
It does.

4611
05:29:00,340 --> 05:29:03,860
Oh, why did they shoot his legs?

4612
05:29:04,620 --> 05:29:05,440
You'll be killed.

4613
05:29:07,620 --> 05:29:08,700
Oh, my.

4614
05:29:11,340 --> 05:29:13,120
Legs that allow it to go anywhere.

4615
05:29:14,120 --> 05:29:16,400
Just as when humans learn to walk upright.

4616
05:29:16,920 --> 05:29:19,460
That is the real revolution in weaponry.

4617
05:29:19,680 --> 05:29:20,580
Don't you agree?

4618
05:29:21,040 --> 05:29:22,180
Oh, my God.

4619
05:29:22,960 --> 05:29:24,740
Listen to me, you fool.

4620
05:29:25,920 --> 05:29:27,400
What are you talking about?

4621
05:29:27,520 --> 05:29:29,040
This is so funny.

4622
05:29:30,100 --> 05:29:32,020
Put that thing away.

4623
05:29:32,520 --> 05:29:33,680
Spoil my drink.

4624
05:29:33,940 --> 05:29:36,060
It's like a real shit pose.

4625
05:29:36,380 --> 05:29:39,540
This feels like a YouTube poop where he just keeps saying legs.

4626
05:29:39,860 --> 05:29:41,480
You mean you've never heard of me?

4627
05:29:42,160 --> 05:29:44,200
And you call yourself an agent.

4628
05:29:47,040 --> 05:29:48,020
Very well, then.

4629
05:29:48,640 --> 05:29:49,640
It's so tough.

4630
05:29:49,640 --> 05:29:51,960
I am Alexander Leonovic Grady.

4631
05:29:52,880 --> 05:29:55,370
Are you going to kill him?

4632
05:29:57,140 --> 05:30:00,840
It is a revolutionary mobile nuclear missile system.

4633
05:30:01,180 --> 05:30:02,940
A bipedal tank.

4634
05:30:06,800 --> 05:30:07,500
Legs.

4635
05:30:11,400 --> 05:30:12,700
Hashtag legs.

4636
05:30:12,980 --> 05:30:13,520
Oh my gosh.

4637
05:30:13,760 --> 05:30:14,960
You know, she's thinking so much.

4638
05:30:15,360 --> 05:30:15,760
Yes.

4639
05:30:16,120 --> 05:30:17,120
A walking tank.

4640
05:30:17,460 --> 05:30:18,140
A robot.

4641
05:30:20,880 --> 05:30:22,720
This is the order of letter.

4642
05:30:24,080 --> 05:30:27,760
He's in honor of the greatest magnet you've been along with.

4643
05:30:30,560 --> 05:30:32,940
He's just talking in there, he's just yapping.

4644
05:30:34,380 --> 05:30:36,160
His voice is so quiet.

4645
05:30:44,020 --> 05:30:46,020
Why did she beat him up?

4646
05:30:46,260 --> 05:30:49,140
What is it going to do with a rocket engine or a tank?

4647
05:30:49,660 --> 05:30:51,480
This is so stupid.

4648
05:30:55,400 --> 05:30:56,740
The tank does not need a rocket.

4649
05:30:58,000 --> 05:30:59,300
Need something else.

4650
05:31:00,240 --> 05:31:01,040
Blanks.

4651
05:31:03,060 --> 05:31:04,500
Say the line.

4652
05:31:08,240 --> 05:31:09,040
Wait,

4653
05:31:22,600 --> 05:31:23,920
I didn't realize when...

4654
05:31:23,920 --> 05:31:26,940
When did Sokolov switch with...

4655
05:31:26,940 --> 05:31:28,220
With Snake?

4656
05:31:31,200 --> 05:31:32,560
Did we beat him?

4657
05:31:32,940 --> 05:31:33,880
Oh, no, wait.

4658
05:31:36,700 --> 05:31:37,500
Oh.

4659
05:31:42,100 --> 05:31:44,020
It's still granon.

4660
05:31:45,080 --> 05:31:46,100
Oh my god.

4661
05:31:46,740 --> 05:31:48,060
He feels like Armstrong.

4662
05:31:48,340 --> 05:31:49,660
You're the intruder.

4663
05:31:49,980 --> 05:31:51,920
Everyone's talking about you.

4664
05:31:53,020 --> 05:31:53,600
What is this?

4665
05:31:54,880 --> 05:31:56,540
This is a YouTube move.

4666
05:31:58,060 --> 05:32:05,260
Oh, he's beating up Sokolov because Sokolov designed the Shagohan without legs.

4667
05:32:07,660 --> 05:32:09,100
Oh my god.

4668
05:32:15,240 --> 05:32:17,000
He does not need a rocket.

4669
05:32:18,060 --> 05:32:19,060
It's surreal.

4670
05:32:21,420 --> 05:32:22,500
He's good.

4671
05:32:23,780 --> 05:32:28,660
I am Alexander Leonovich Guggen.

4672
05:32:45,850 --> 05:32:47,450
Okay, this one is good.

4673
05:32:47,670 --> 05:32:52,470
This one I saw a preview of already, just in the thumbnail, and I'm excited.

4674
05:32:55,530 --> 05:32:57,850
Okay, so this is the third cutscene.

4675
05:33:01,810 --> 05:33:02,410
Legs.

4676
05:33:02,650 --> 05:33:04,650
Lolliloo, low legs.

4677
05:33:08,330 --> 05:33:09,850
Lolliloo, legs.

4678
05:33:09,850 --> 05:33:11,350
Lolliloo, legs low.

4679
05:33:19,720 --> 05:33:21,060
Oh, shirtless.

4680
05:33:23,020 --> 05:33:25,000
I grabbed my new Ochi.

4681
05:33:25,580 --> 05:33:26,840
That was so good.

4682
05:33:31,860 --> 05:33:34,020
Wait, where are those gonna go?

4683
05:33:37,060 --> 05:33:40,760
You are above even the boss.

4684
05:33:40,960 --> 05:33:45,580
I hereby award you the title of Big Boss.

4685
05:33:53,370 --> 05:33:55,850
You are a true patriot.

4686
05:33:58,050 --> 05:33:59,530
This is sick.

4687
05:34:00,050 --> 05:34:01,730
He's grimacing.

4688
05:34:02,290 --> 05:34:03,730
Someone help my man.

4689
05:34:06,570 --> 05:34:09,350
Everyone else is also like,

4690
05:34:12,770 --> 05:34:22,020
Don't pow levels of dumb, you're so right.

4691
05:34:23,320 --> 05:34:24,820
This is actually so stupid.

4692
05:34:27,240 --> 05:34:28,360
Not this scene, though.

4693
05:34:28,500 --> 05:34:29,260
This is so terrible.

4694
05:34:29,440 --> 05:34:29,980
What is he...

4695
05:34:29,980 --> 05:34:30,880
He's like...

4696
05:34:30,880 --> 05:34:31,600
He's like...

4697
05:34:34,620 --> 05:34:36,280
No, not another one.

4698
05:34:37,620 --> 05:34:38,760
No, no, no, no.

4699
05:34:42,860 --> 05:34:47,840
The sound effect is so terrible.

4700
05:34:49,340 --> 05:34:54,810
You know, a unit like Fox in the army.

4701
05:34:56,170 --> 05:35:00,290
Someone like him to handle our top secret sneaking missions for us.

4702
05:35:00,310 --> 05:35:01,270
It's so bad.

4703
05:35:01,630 --> 05:35:03,970
A man who combines the qualities of a soldier and an agent.

4704
05:35:10,820 --> 05:35:14,220
Can you forget to change your outfit before the cut's in?

4705
05:35:14,680 --> 05:35:16,440
No, no, don't do another one.

4706
05:35:17,360 --> 05:35:17,880
Okay, good.

4707
05:35:19,220 --> 05:35:19,520
No!

4708
05:35:20,080 --> 05:35:20,640
No.

4709
05:35:21,980 --> 05:35:23,020
Don't do it.

4710
05:35:23,120 --> 05:35:24,400
Paramedic, don't do it.

4711
05:35:24,920 --> 05:35:26,860
There's another one.

4712
05:35:36,620 --> 05:35:38,660
They're reusing that part.

4713
05:35:39,980 --> 05:35:41,160
With Tatiana.

4714
05:35:48,180 --> 05:35:48,460
What?

4715
05:35:48,820 --> 05:35:49,240
What the?

4716
05:35:49,720 --> 05:35:52,320
I am a patient man.

4717
05:36:07,190 --> 05:36:08,930
It was all just a dream.

4718
05:36:16,310 --> 05:36:16,510
Uh-oh.

4719
05:36:16,730 --> 05:36:18,750
Oh, it's a leech on his teeth.

4720
05:36:24,360 --> 05:36:26,740
That's why he was having the bad dream.

4721
05:36:37,920 --> 05:36:39,100
Wait, there's another one?

4722
05:36:40,120 --> 05:36:41,500
Oh, this is still the same one.

4723
05:36:42,360 --> 05:36:42,840
Oh, no.

4724
05:36:47,280 --> 05:36:47,720
Whoa.

4725
05:36:53,130 --> 05:36:54,530
Does he not see the leech?

4726
05:36:54,610 --> 05:36:55,610
I think he likes it.

4727
05:36:56,990 --> 05:36:58,150
Wait, it just keeps going.

4728
05:37:00,930 --> 05:37:06,010
He came prepared with like actual battle armor so that he would.

4729
05:37:13,770 --> 05:37:16,210
This is something he would do.

4730
05:37:18,910 --> 05:37:21,830
This is so in character for him actually.

4731
05:37:24,030 --> 05:37:26,790
You are above even the boss.

4732
05:37:28,790 --> 05:37:30,110
No, he's scared!

4733
05:37:30,510 --> 05:37:31,190
Look at him!

4734
05:37:36,060 --> 05:37:39,060
Did you hear it drop to the ground?

4735
05:37:50,270 --> 05:37:51,410
That was good.

4736
05:37:51,670 --> 05:37:52,850
That was so silly.

4737
05:37:54,650 --> 05:37:56,570
That was so silly!

4738
05:37:56,910 --> 05:37:57,870
Oh my gosh!

4739
05:37:57,970 --> 05:38:03,240
They're just as good as the originals, honestly.

4740
05:38:05,360 --> 05:38:06,520
That's so funny.

4741
05:38:08,580 --> 05:38:09,260
Wow!

4742
05:38:10,060 --> 05:38:11,100
Oh my gosh.

4743
05:38:12,880 --> 05:38:14,580
This game is straight up art.

4744
05:38:17,360 --> 05:38:19,540
Oh, the three new ones are so good.

4745
05:38:19,860 --> 05:38:23,700
I'm obsessed with Grandin's being obsessed with legs.

4746
05:38:25,820 --> 05:38:27,260
I can't get over it.

4747
05:38:27,500 --> 05:38:28,420
It's so funny.

4748
05:38:30,840 --> 05:38:32,500
Oh, in front of the...

4749
05:38:33,120 --> 05:38:34,860
Oh, this is so sad.

4750
05:38:37,120 --> 05:38:38,260
This is so sad.

4751
05:38:38,900 --> 05:38:40,740
What is MGS even about, bro?

4752
05:38:42,880 --> 05:39:07,240

4754

So cool!

4755
05:39:27,670 --> 05:39:29,050
Why is your...

4756
05:39:29,050 --> 05:39:30,070
Okay, look at them.

4757
05:39:30,730 --> 05:39:31,650
Shagohad.

4758
05:39:34,130 --> 05:39:34,810
Nice.

4759
05:39:35,890 --> 05:39:40,310
One, two, three.

4760
05:39:40,930 --> 05:39:41,730
Sub-characters.

4761
05:39:42,010 --> 05:39:43,690
Oh, wow, you can even really...

4762
05:39:43,690 --> 05:39:45,310
You can look at their...

4763
05:39:45,310 --> 05:39:46,910
Rycom...

4764
05:39:46,910 --> 05:39:47,270
No!

4765
05:39:48,090 --> 05:39:49,270
Why from behind?

4766
05:39:51,310 --> 05:39:53,870
What you want to join me?

4767
05:39:54,490 --> 05:39:54,870
Fine then.

4768
05:39:55,470 --> 05:39:56,690
Come on in.

4769
05:39:57,090 --> 05:39:58,490
Someone in here.

4770
05:39:59,830 --> 05:40:00,410
Johnny.

4771
05:40:01,450 --> 05:40:02,610
Hold on.

4772
05:40:03,170 --> 05:40:05,230
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all.

4773
05:40:05,870 --> 05:40:06,950
Even the horse.

4774
05:40:09,650 --> 05:40:10,830
Wait, is he gonna say that?

4775
05:40:11,250 --> 05:40:14,290
I am Alex, a kind of metal gear, if you will.

4776
05:40:15,130 --> 05:40:15,710
Legs.

4777
05:40:15,710 --> 05:40:17,530
Legs that allow it to go anywhere.

4778
05:40:18,410 --> 05:40:20,370
Just as humans learn to walk up.

4779
05:40:20,390 --> 05:40:37,150
right that is the real revolution in weaponry don't you agree i'm obsessed i'm obsessed with that one it's so funny yeah he really got no butt huh it's like concave even a little

4785
05:43:23,940 --> 05:43:24,860
I sure hope so.

4786
05:43:30,950 --> 05:43:32,150
But yeah.

4787
05:43:33,410 --> 05:43:35,030
So Fingies Crossed.

4788
05:43:35,430 --> 05:43:36,470
Fingies Crossed.

4789
05:43:36,510 --> 05:43:37,610
Fingies Crossed.

4790
05:43:38,110 --> 05:43:40,930
That we hear more about the Master Collection Volume 2.

4791
05:43:41,230 --> 05:43:43,190
And also that it has 4 in it.

4792
05:43:44,270 --> 05:43:47,290
I would really love for like...

4793
05:43:47,290 --> 05:43:48,790
Honestly, just the rest of the games.

4794
05:43:49,050 --> 05:43:49,570
Like 4.

4795
05:43:52,050 --> 05:43:54,370
I don't think they need to...

4796
05:43:55,030 --> 05:44:03,070
do five again but like acid, hoops you know everything.

4797
05:44:03,270 --> 05:44:04,290
I want everything.

4798
05:44:07,530 --> 05:44:08,050
Peace Walker?

4799
05:44:11,210 --> 05:44:12,550
Maybe I'm being greedy.

4800
05:44:15,270 --> 05:44:17,370
Imagine it would be four Peace Walker V.

4801
05:44:18,150 --> 05:44:18,910
Yeah, maybe.

4802
05:44:20,190 --> 05:44:21,330
We got Membu tomorrow!

4803
05:44:21,610 --> 05:44:21,890
Yeah!

4804
05:44:22,450 --> 05:44:26,690
Oh, we've done movie watchalongs the past couple of so I kind of want to do something else.

4805
05:44:27,230 --> 05:44:27,630
Well, we'll see.

4806
05:44:27,830 --> 05:44:29,730
Have you decided what you're going to do for stream tomorrow?

4807
05:44:30,130 --> 05:44:30,350
Nope.

4808
05:44:30,750 --> 05:44:31,630
I'll figure it out.

4809
05:44:33,750 --> 05:44:35,010
It's fine to be greedy.

4810
05:44:35,370 --> 05:44:35,950
Is it?

4811
05:44:36,230 --> 05:44:36,850
Be greedy?

4812
05:44:37,510 --> 05:44:37,810
Yeah.

4813
05:44:42,550 --> 05:44:47,190
Because already you can get V on Steam, so it feels kind of weird to release it.

4814
05:44:48,110 --> 05:44:52,490
But I guess maybe to have it on a different platform would be nice, too.

4815
05:44:53,930 --> 05:44:54,370
Yeah.

4816
05:44:55,030 --> 05:44:56,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4817
05:44:56,890 --> 05:44:57,790
But this was fun.

4818
05:44:58,470 --> 05:44:59,390
This was so, so fun.

4819
05:45:00,410 --> 05:45:00,810
Whoa.

4820
05:45:02,110 --> 05:45:04,490
I thought I was like, I wonder if I'll cry.

4821
05:45:05,390 --> 05:45:06,250
And I still cry.

4822
05:45:06,490 --> 05:45:08,090
I cry every time.

4823
05:45:10,190 --> 05:45:11,650
Yeah, ghost babble.

4824
05:45:12,970 --> 05:45:15,270
The Game Boy games would be nice.

4825
05:45:18,470 --> 05:45:19,590
Yes, yes, yes.

4826
05:45:26,050 --> 05:45:27,330
