00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,540
Oops.

2
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,600
Oops.

3
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,480
Hold on.

4
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,200
Hello.

5
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,640
Welcome to Outer Wilds Echoes of the Eye.

6
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,060
Hello.

7
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
The theme song.

8
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,540
I know.

9
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,220
I've been sitting here, just like, tearing up.

10
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,860
Listening to it.

11
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,800
Thank you for the vibe gift.

12
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,560
Thank you so much.

13
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,940
Two months already.

14
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,560
Let's go.

15
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
Thank you, Moth.

16
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,160
And Foxplay.

17
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,600
Thank you.

18
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,400
Hearing this music, I'm gonna cry.

19
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,060
It's so wet.

20
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,720
Yes, I'm super duper excited to be playing the DLC of Outer Wilds.

21
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,420
I saw some people saying, like, oh, I didn't see Outer Wilds on Mint's channel.

22
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,360
But I have played it before.

23
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,780
That's why I'm not streaming it, because it's kind of...

24
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,220
And I played it kind of recently.

25
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,420
It's hard...

26
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,600
It's a difficult game to replay.

27
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,220
In a sense.

28
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,820
Because...

29
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,940
Well, I mean, just...

30
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,600
I mean, not difficult.

31
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,360
But, like...

32
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,040
If you've played it, then I think you understand.

33
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,940
Can't really unlearn it.

34
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,560
Exactly.

35
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,100
Exactly.

36
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,360
I would already know all the puzzles, and where to go, and all this and that.

37
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,300
Thank you for all the fun, and for being so kind.

38
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,200
It's always nice hanging out in your streams.

39
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,140
What?

40
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,700
Thank you!

41
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,720
Thank you so much!

42
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,340
Why?

43
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,040
Thank you so much.

44
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,640
Oh my goodness.

45
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,080
I'd recommend playing through the base game first, but I got a feeling that you're smart enough to just start with the DLC.

46
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
I have played it.

47
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,180
Yeah, so...

48
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,140
Yeah...

49
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,880
You would have to erase your memory.

50
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,520
I know!

51
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,720
So, I'm a little sad that...

52
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,780
That I already played it, so I can't stream it here.

53
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,560
But...

54
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,140
But, I can do the DLC!

55
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,220
So...

56
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,440
That I have not played yet, at all.

57
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,500
I actually know zero things about it.

58
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,760
And...

59
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
Let's see...

60
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,320
The summary called you an A.I.

61
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,080
G.W.

62
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,120
Turn off the PC right now.

63
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,880
What's really funny, too, is Outer Wilds is a game that...

64
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,160
I only really ever see these comments...

65
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,600
For Outer Wilds.

66
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,620
Of people saying that they can't watch the stream...

67
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,300
Because they want to play the game themselves.

68
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,700
Or they're in the middle of playing the game.

69
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,460
So...

70
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,140
It's pretty funny.

71
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,860
But it is definitely...

72
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,760
If you have not played the game before...

73
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,140
Maybe you've watched someone play it.

74
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,340
Which I guess is okay, too.

75
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,420
Definitely one of those types of games, though.

76
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,800
That...

77
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,200
Is so highly recommended.

78
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,680
You know?

79
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,200
Completely valid.

80
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,880
Of course!

81
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,540
Of course!

82
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,120
I had to stop watching someone play it, too.

83
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,260
To do that, too.

84
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,340
Yeah.

85
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,060
It's...

86
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,220
It's totally valid.

87
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,940
And so I...

88
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,640
Part of me is just like...

89
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,300
Hmm...

90
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,020
Should I even stream it at all?

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,360
You know?

92
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,000
But...

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,040
I also...

94
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,740
Truly enjoy...

95
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,760
Sharing these types of memories with you guys.

96
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,140
So...

97
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,260
You know...

98
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,380
I do choose to sometimes play things.

99
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,180
Even though the people are like...

100
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,520
No, no.

101
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,600
You should play this.

102
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,020
And take it in yourself.

103
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,780
But I also kinda like...

104
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:22,960
You know?

105
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,200
Having our little...

106
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,400
You know?

107
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,540
I like having my...

108
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,740
Reactions...

109
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,520
And my...

110
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,320
You know?

111
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,940
My first time reactions...

112
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,520
Recorded.

113
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,420
Because you can never take that back!

114
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,320
You know?

115
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,000
Once you...

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,680
Once you experience something...

117
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,660
You can never experience it for the first time again!

118
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,020
And so...

119
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,700
If I can watch myself...

120
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,200
You know?

121
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,020
In the future...

122
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,880
I can go back...

123
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,240
And watch...

124
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,600
Like...

125
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,500
If I'm just like...

126
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,340
Thinking about her wiles...

127
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,900
I can be like...

128
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,160
How did I react to this?

129
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,940
You know?

130
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,740
So...

131
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,600
Hmm...

132
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
She doesn't hate us?

133
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,440
Um...

134
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,420
So...

135
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:01,900
Um...

136
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:02,800
Actually...

137
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,780
For this...

138
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,260
Uh...

139
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,580
I don't know exactly...

140
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,300
Um...

141
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:08,900
I...

142
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,840
I...

143
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,460
I tried looking it up without...

144
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,340
Looking it up...

145
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,680
Um...

146
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,840
The closest I'll ever get to playing Outer Wilds again is watching someone else experience it for the first time.

147
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,080
Thanks for streaming it for us.

148
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,300
Ah!

149
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,460
Thank you!

150
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,840
Thanks for the super chat, Yura!

151
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,600
Mr. Yura!

152
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,400
Thank you!

153
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,680
Yeah!

154
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,860
I feel that way too, though.

155
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,660
Right?

156
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,460
Um...

157
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,820
You can resume.

158
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,500
Well...

159
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,520
So...

160
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,780
I actually...

161
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,700
Re-bought the game.

162
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,980
Because I had the other...

163
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,180
My...

164
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,660
I played it...

165
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,940
I played it before on a different account.

166
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,300
And I...

167
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:42,820
Um...

168
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,660
Had to re-buy the game.

169
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,880
And...

170
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,460
Um...

171
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,400
And...

172
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,860
Uh...

173
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,020
Uh...

174
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,620
The TLC.

175
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,760
So...

176
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,480
Um...

177
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,100
Actually...

178
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,600
I just played like a little bit of it yesterday.

179
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,640
So...

180
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,040
Um...

181
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,660
I was kind of...

182
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,260
Because I was worried.

183
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,960
I was just like...

184
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,520
Do I...

185
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,340
Need to have beaten the game...

186
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:03,980
Before?

187
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,020
But it seems like...

188
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,240
As long as I have the knowledge...

189
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,640
I don't have a problem.

190
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,200
I don't have to have...

191
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,940
It...

192
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,240
In my save file.

193
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,840
Um...

194
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,980
From what I understand...

195
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,280
Um...

196
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,540
That's correct.

197
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,980
Okay.

198
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,560
Okay.

199
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:21,760
Good.

200
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,200
Down!

201
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,340
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

202
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,920
Thank you.

203
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,800
It might change some things.

204
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,040
Wait.

205
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,420
My ship log.

206
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,120
I know.

207
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,000
I know.

208
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,000
I was looking at it.

209
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,620
I was like...

210
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,360
I was like...

211
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,680
Oh man.

212
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,160
I kind of want to do like a summary.

213
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,740
Like...

214
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,040
Wow.

215
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,540
What happened?

216
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,560
Everything.

217
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,120
But...

218
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,020
Um...

219
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,020
If...

220
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,200
If...

221
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,140
If...

222
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,240
If...

223
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,420
You guys tell me that I must have...

224
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,520
Completed the game...

225
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,360
In...

226
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,800
In...

227
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,340
In the fact that I need a...

228
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,980
Completed save file...

229
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,300
I...

230
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,960
Do have access to that.

231
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,080
So...

232
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,180
Um...

233
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,260
So...

234
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,880
I don't...

235
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,820
Oh!

236
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,040
What the heck?

237
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,000
OBS just disconnected.

238
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,660
I think YouTube is having some issues...

239
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,080
Today.

240
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,740
Um...

241
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,000
So...

242
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,400
The DLC ending is better if you completed the game before.

243
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,140
Which I have.

244
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,840
Which I have.

245
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,040
I have completed the game before.

246
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,120
I have the knowledge in my brain.

247
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,300
Spanking Hive!

248
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,860
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

249
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,400
Thank you.

250
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,520
Parts of the ship log will affect elements of the DLC.

251
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,260
Ah ha.

252
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,760
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm sorry.

254
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,410
What should I do?

255
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,250
It doesn't matter.

256
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:52,650
Don't worry.

257
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,330
Okay.

258
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,150
Maybe it's okay then.

259
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,920
It doesn't matter.

260
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,200
Okay.

261
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,440
Okay.

262
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,580
Then I'm just gonna resume.

263
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,980
And...

264
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,340
Hopefully it's okay.

265
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,140
Hopefully it's okay.

266
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,440
Okay.

267
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,420
Okay.

268
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay.

269
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,700
That feels so cool.

270
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,880
Being here again.

271
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,880
So yeah.

272
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
I kind of...

273
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,460
Here.

274
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,580
I can even show you...

275
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,140
Like I started the game yesterday.

276
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:26,540
Oh!

277
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,320
Oh!

278
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,720
I already got them from the observ...

279
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh!

280
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,480
See?

281
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,920
See?

282
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,200
I literally only did one loop.

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,140
Thanks for streaming this.

284
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,220
Thank you for the super chat!

285
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,300
I already got them.

286
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,900
Must be inhaling more fumes than I realized.

287
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,060
That stuff is potent.

288
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,380
Well, if you've got the codes, I'm not gonna stop you.

289
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,540
Good luck and take care of that ship.

290
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,020
Bye.

291
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,220
Bye.

292
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,480
Bye.

293
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,940
Bye.

294
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:54,960
There's a lot of fumes.

295
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,420
Let's see.

296
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,080
My poor ship log.

297
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,660
I went to Giants Deep.

298
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,660
And that's about all I did.

299
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,920
I saw Gabbro.

300
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,440
I saw the bro.

301
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,540
That's all.

302
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,080
Everything else is...

303
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,480
Look.

304
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:15,700
Oh.

305
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:15,960
Whoops.

306
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,500
Everything else is...

307
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,140
It's totally empty.

308
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,900
It feels so... I was like, no!

309
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,280
I've done more!

310
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,900
All you need is the Quantum Moon and the center of the Interloper.

311
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,840
Oh.

312
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,340
You didn't go to the Bramble?

313
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,400
No way!

314
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,180
No way.

315
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,100
Did you get meditation?

316
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,820
No, I think I needed to have gone through a loop first to get the meditation.

317
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,120
So maybe before we do the DLC maybe I will grab...

318
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,360
Oh wait.

319
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,420
Maybe I will grab a couple things, right?

320
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,100
Maybe it would be good.

321
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:09,580
Core things that make the DLC better that add scenes are visiting the comet and your teleporting moon friend mainly.

322
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,060
But it's not essential.

323
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:11,880
Okay.

324
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,440
But I do kind of want the full experience, right?

325
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,300
Because I beat the game.

326
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,200
So it's kind of like...

327
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,540
Oh.

328
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,040
Oh.

329
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,680
Am I going to make it?

330
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:21,960
Ouch.

331
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,400
Oh god.

332
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,220
Nobody saw that.

333
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,310
Oh my goodness, that is so loud.

334
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,850
I might need your help then.

335
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,030
If you guys are backseaters, rejoice.

336
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,950
I might need your help then a little bit.

337
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,010
With exactly where I need to go if you guys don't mind a little bit.

338
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:58,210
And if you don't mind a little bit of exploration before we get into the DLC itself.

339
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,030
Finally, it's our time to shine.

340
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,510
Yeah, like it just opened its eyes and they're like...

341
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,170
Wowee.

342
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,830
But the DLC is here, right?

343
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,530
New exhibit.

344
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:21,970
The radio tower here on Timber Hearth was built to receive transmissions from our deep space satellite.

345
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,150
And to this day still houses the first ever photos taken of the entire solar system.

346
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,230
Am I in the way?

347
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:40,210
These photos were made possible by the deep space satellite's unusual vertical orbit that carries it high above and below the plane of the solar system.

348
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,350
Oh so it's the radio tower, not here.

349
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:53,350
Thanks to a recent upgrade, the deep space satellite is now responsible for generating the real time solar system map used by our newest astronauts.

350
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:56,930
Okay.

351
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,630
Hello quantum... unusual signal.

352
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,430
So creepy.

353
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,310
Oh, I'm stuck.

354
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,290
Um, hello?

355
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,350
Eww.

356
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:13,670
Eww.

357
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,610
These fish.

358
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,390
These dang stinkin' fish.

359
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,990
You have your textures on one eighth.

360
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,310
I was worried about my computer.

361
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,770
Maybe I'll change it.

362
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,300
Wait.

363
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,560
Oh you know what, I'll just do full.

364
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,060
I think I changed everything else from very high to high though.

365
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,800
Except... yeah.

366
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,700
Should be fine then.

367
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,240
Corky!

368
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,240
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

369
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:46,780
Thank you!

370
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,400
Absolutely adore this game.

371
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,020
Have fun with the DLC.

372
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,080
Thank you Waffle & Sign!

373
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,100
Thank you!

374
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,860
Waffles...

375
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,620
Can I leave the menu?

376
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,420
That's amazing that you could tell immediately.

377
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,860
You were like, um, your textures are not optimal.

378
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,380
That's so crazy.

379
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:07,480
Crazy.

380
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,680
The pictures were very crunchy.

381
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,280
Oh, was that because... was that why?

382
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,960
Oh you're right!

383
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
I'm like, wow!

384
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,520
How could you tell?

385
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,660
I thought that's just how they were supposed to be.

386
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,110
Okay.

387
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,150
I get it.

388
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,910
I was like, wow.

389
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,510
I can't see anything.

390
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,270
Alrighty.

391
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,760
Wow, it's such a nice day.

392
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,620
To die.

393
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,360
Oh wait.

394
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,480
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!

395
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,600
Oh, I'm fine.

396
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,440
Let's go back to our ship.

397
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,040
And let's go get some of the things that we need for an optimal game.

398
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,080
And let's go get some of the things that we need for an optimal game.

399
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,660
And let's go get some of the things that we need for an optimal ending.

400
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,460
So happy to see you again, Minto!

401
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,120
So happy to see you again, Minto!

402
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,440
Thank you!

403
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,880
Oh wait, I'm gonna die here.

404
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,720
Um,

405
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,550
oopsie.

406
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,930
I forgot that.

407
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,450
I forgot that.

408
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,810
Um...

409
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,890
I'm gonna turn the audio down just a little bit.

410
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,130
I'm gonna turn the audio down just a little bit.

411
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,150
Quite loud.

412
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,190
Oh, whoopsie!

413
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,030
Oh, that's fine!

414
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,830
We have the full day now, right?

415
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,850
We have the full day.

416
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,690
It's all good.

417
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,050
Whoopsie!

418
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,810
Okay.

419
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,230
So, you guys said the meteor?

420
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,310
The interloper?

421
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:03,730
Um...

422
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,370
Oh gosh, how do I get there again?

423
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,370
Um...

424
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,590
Hmm...

425
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,530
Uh...

426
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,590
It wasn't just crash landing on it, right?

427
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,270
Or...

428
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,790
Just fly onto it?

429
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,910
Interloper and quantum moon.

430
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,170
How do I get to the quantum moon again?

431
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,170
Do you remember how to get to the quantum moon?

432
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,910
Um...

433
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,290
I can just fly to the interloper.

434
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,650
Okay, let's fly there then.

435
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,650
Let's not fly into the sun.

436
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,630
Let's not fly into the sun.

437
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,270
Where's the sun?

438
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,050
Over there.

439
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,850
Okay, we're good.

440
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,330
Okay.

441
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,550
Okay.

442
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,670
Alright.

443
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,850
Where's our interloper, friend?

444
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,790
Hmm...

445
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,590
Somewhere.

446
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,530
Giant state.

447
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,070
Is that the moon?

448
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,470
Right there?

449
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,950
Oh gosh.

450
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,050
What was it again?

451
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,530
Um...

452
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,620
I'll remember.

453
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,560
Eventually.

454
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,660
I'll remember eventually.

455
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,480
I'll remember eventually.

456
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,760
Wait!

457
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,160
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

458
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,140
Um...

459
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,180
Did it have to do with...

460
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,320
With the camera?

461
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:28,880
Right?

462
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,080
Is that it?

463
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,440
No, that's some...

464
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
What is that?

465
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,240
Why is left stick not doing anything?

466
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,420
Hmm...

467
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,500
Is that the...

468
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,440
The white hole moon?

469
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,920
Or the station?

470
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,700
White hole station?

471
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,020
Yes?

472
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,340
Yes?

473
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,600
Jeffrey!

474
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,000
Are you actually here?

475
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,380
Um...

476
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,600
Jeffrey, I had to make a new game.

477
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,920
So I'm getting some of the stuff...

478
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,200
Wait!

479
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,680
Nope, that's just a really bright star.

480
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,260
Where the heck is this thing?

481
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,520
Hello?

482
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,100
Interloper.

483
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,780
Uh-uh.

484
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,740
Go into your settings and rewind.

485
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,420
Maybe I have to.

486
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,420
Controls...

487
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,540
Oh wait.

488
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,940
Movement?

489
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,000
Just kidding.

490
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,420
Um...

491
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,120
Should be fine, right?

492
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,800
Wait.

493
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,700
Flight.

494
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,720
Lock on.

495
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,980
Yeah, I've been pressing down on L, F.

496
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,440
Hmm, weird.

497
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,960
Ducky, thanks for the gift card!

498
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,580
Hmm...

499
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,840
Jeffrey said known bug.

500
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,420
I'm getting a sense of deja vu.

501
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,860
I don't know about you!

502
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,480
Okay, hold on.

503
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,680
How do I unbind it?

504
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,680
Uh...

505
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,920
Oh.

506
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,680
Wait.

507
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,680
Okay.

508
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm sorry, the lock-on bug has haunted me for years.

509
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,420
Just rewind lock-on again.

510
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,160
Okay, thank you, Jeffrey.

511
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,640
I'm playing this because...

512
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,560
I...

513
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
I saw that you were able to...

514
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,520
Or I heard, rather, that you were able to meet...

515
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,200
Matara Ofukai.

516
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,180
Unless she's a liar.

517
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,180
But I got your note.

518
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,820
Thank you.

519
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,260
Couple things for the 10 gifted!

520
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,020
Where the heck is...

521
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,060
Okay, let's see if it works now.

522
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:35,860
Oh!

523
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,860
Yippee!

524
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,240
Okay.

525
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,940
I'm looking for the interloper.

526
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,100
I'm looking for...

527
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,040
The interloper.

528
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,660
Wait.

529
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,880
Is that the...

530
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,280
No, that's Ash Twin.

531
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,540
I was like, is that the sun station?

532
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,040
I wonder...

533
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,280
Wait, where did the Quantum Moon go?

534
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,820
Wait!

535
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,460
I see it!

536
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,960
I see it!

537
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,320
I'm gonna miss it.

538
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,620
It's gonna go straight to the sun.

539
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,420
Wait.

540
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,460
Hold on.

541
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:08,820
Interloper!

542
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,860
I see you!

543
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,360
Yes!

544
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,080
Use your map?

545
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
It's more fun to use my eyes a little bit, right?

546
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,620
Oh, gosh.

547
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,180
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to reach this.

548
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,240
Casey!

549
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,920
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

550
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,280
Thank you.

551
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,160
Oh, gosh.

552
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:32,780
Oh.

553
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,100
Oh.

554
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,980
Oh.

555
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,240
Okay.

556
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,300
We might be fine.

557
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,060
Maybe.

558
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,900
Coming in hot.

559
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,780
Coming in hot.

560
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,520
Coming in hot.

561
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,360
How do I...

562
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,880
I don't remember how to...

563
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,400
Okay.

564
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,360
I'm coming in real hot.

565
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,480
Oh, great!

566
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,900
Here I am!

567
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,820
Interloper!

568
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,200
Oh, my goodness.

569
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,560
How do I land again?

570
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,640
I don't remember.

571
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,460
Okay.

572
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,060
We're fine.

573
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,820
Everything's good.

574
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,760
Bonk!

575
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,160
Bonk!

576
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,680
Bonk!

577
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:07,940
Bonk!

578
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,480
Oh, shoot!

579
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,080
I don't wanna die!

580
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,900
I don't wanna die!

581
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,860
Wait!

582
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,570
I'm here!

583
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,510
Oh, wait.

584
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,230
No, no, no.

585
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,410
Please.

586
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:39,910
Interloper!

587
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:40,610
Interloper!

588
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,390
Let me on you!

589
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,270
Okay.

590
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:45,710
I'm falling.

591
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,750
I'm in the gravity source.

592
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,590
Gravitational pole.

593
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,350
Wait.

594
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:51,930
How do I go down?

595
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:52,250
Here we go.

596
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:52,710
Oh, please.

597
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:53,410
Please.

598
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,290
It's been a minute since I've played this game.

599
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:58,650
Oh, no.

600
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,250
I'm gonna reach the sun.

601
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:00,630
Wait.

602
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:00,970
Wait.

603
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,210
Wait.

604
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,410
Oh, god.

605
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,290
Please.

606
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,130
Please.

607
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,490
Let me on you.

608
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,150
Okay.

609
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,790
Ouch!

610
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,450
It's fine.

611
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,710
Just a scratch.

612
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,050
Alright.

613
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,210
We're here.

614
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,390
Just don't jump.

615
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,430
Just don't jump.

616
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,790
Whatever you do, little alien.

617
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,450
We're there.

618
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:22,650
Here.

619
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:22,830
Here.

620
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,110
Here.

621
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:24,370
Ouch.

622
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,370
Ouch.

623
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,670
Okay.

624
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:27,530
We're good.

625
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,830
We're good.

626
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,030
We're good.

627
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,870
This is a thing I need.

628
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,350
Right?

629
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,390
Yeah.

630
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:32,570
Yeah.

631
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:32,690
Yeah.

632
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,470
Okay.

633
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,010
The shuttle may freeze entirely.

634
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,350
I got my Mentara postcard today!

635
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,310
I think it got caught in a conveyor.

636
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,970
Oh, no!

637
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,110
Really?

638
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:48,850
Avi!

639
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,570
Thanks for the...

640
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:50,730
50?

641
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,590
Oh.

642
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:52,770
Oh.

643
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,070
Wait.

644
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:53,450
Hold on.

645
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,210
Sorry.

646
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,370
If I click out of the...

647
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,730
Thank you for the 50 gift!

648
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,610
Thank you so much!

649
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:58,650
Thank you!

650
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,090
Oh.

651
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:01,470
Next page.

652
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,510
Sorry.

653
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,690
I'm gonna skip some...

654
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,330
Actually, no.

655
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,290
I'm not gonna skip through it.

656
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,310
Because I want a good recap.

657
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:06,690
Right?

658
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,150
Even if it did...

659
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,770
Couldn't someone call it back home to the Gravity Cannon on Ember Twin?

660
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,590
Takes quite the specimen to nearly miss falling off the ground.

661
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,090
Stop!

662
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,670
Yes.

663
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,970
But the exploration of the comet would be more difficult if we were without the shuttle until someone recalled it.

664
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,570
Perhaps we shouldn't have landed on the dark side of the comet.

665
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,190
Suppose one of us remained in the shuttle to keep it warm and continue monitoring the surface.

666
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,510
This would be wise, I think, Clary.

667
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,530
If you don't mind waiting here with it, Poki and I can continue to investigate the surface.

668
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,610
So...

669
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,130
From my memory...

670
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,770
From my memory...

671
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:51,110
The comet is basically the cause of, like, their overall demise.

672
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,170
Right?

673
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,250
There was, like, the...

674
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,390
It had, like, the stuff inside...

675
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:55,670
Oh, sorry.

676
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,350
Spoilers!

677
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,130
If you have not played, please don't watch the stream.

678
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,210
The ghost matter!

679
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,490
The ghost matter.

680
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,530
Yes.

681
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,990
So, basically, I remember going into the comet and just seeing them dead in there.

682
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,670
It's so sad.

683
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,210
Okay.

684
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,590
Ship log updated.

685
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,650
Can we get inside there?

686
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,570
Was there a way to?

687
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,370
Or... maybe there wasn't.

688
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,430
Can I get inside...

689
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,950
Oh, how do I get inside the comet now?

690
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,190
Go in there again for the log?

691
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,430
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,410
I just have to figure out how to get in.

693
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,770
When it's near the sun, it's gotta melt, right?

694
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,290
Oh, no!

695
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:44,650
Wait!

696
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,190
It already...

697
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,380
Oh, shoot.

698
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,580
Why did you spread your matter all over the solar system?

699
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,000
It's just, you know...

700
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,360
ghosty things, right?

701
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,100
Where's my ship?

702
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,520
Oh, no!

703
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,090
Really?

704
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,910
It won't go back to the sun, right?

705
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,450
I think we won't have the chance to...

706
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:14,490
Um...

707
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,630
Hmm...

708
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,630
Well, shoot.

709
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,350
I have to be really fast then, don't I?

710
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,170
That's okay.

711
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:22,690
That's okay.

712
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,170
We have one more pass, but not for a while.

713
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,050
Well, I'm...

714
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,570
I'm here, so...

715
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,750
I might run out of oxygen, though.

716
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,670
Where did my ship go?

717
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,110
Maybe I can reach my ship.

718
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:40,510
Whoa!

719
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,170
Whoa!

720
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:41,770
Whoa!

721
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,350
Whoa!

722
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:42,990
Whoa!

723
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:43,650
Ship!

724
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,010
Um...

725
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,350
I don't wanna...

726
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,130
Oh, gosh.

727
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,170
The bramble.

728
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,390
Ship!

729
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,030
Ship!

730
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:57,750
Ship, ship, ship!

731
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,170
Oh, my God.

732
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,650
It's so close.

733
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,810
I'm just gonna jump for it.

734
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,070
You guys, I'm gonna jump for it.

735
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,430
I'm coming for you!

736
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:05,410
Ship!

737
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,550
It's in the gravitational pull, so...

738
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,470
Wait, can I actually match its velocity?

739
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,730
Come on, ship.

740
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:12,850
Okay.

741
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,390
Oh, my gosh.

742
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,190
I might have enough fuel.

743
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,250
I might be able to do this!

744
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,410
Wait, I might be able to do this.

745
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,470
Oh, gosh.

746
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,310
Okay.

747
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,350
Okay.

748
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,310
I can do this.

749
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,830
I can do this.

750
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:22,790
Okay.

751
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,110
Ship.

752
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,130
Where's the entrance?

753
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,170
Come on, ship.

754
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,310
Where are you?

755
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:26,890
Oh, there it is!

756
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:27,230
I see it!

757
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,450
I see it!

758
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:27,690
I see it!

759
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,890
I can do

760
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,440
this.

761
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,880
Yes!

762
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:38,880
Yippee!

763
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:46,750
Um...

764
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,130
Anyway, uh...

765
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,510
Buckle up, buttercup, or...

766
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,390
Where else did I need... Oh, the quantum moon.

767
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,650
It's so cool just being here, though.

768
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,210
Are we that... Are we so close to the sun?

769
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,190
Um...

770
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,310
How do I view my map?

771
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,530
Oh.

772
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:03,170
No.

773
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,690
Oh, it's gonna take a while, isn't it?

774
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,790
Oh, it's gonna take a while, isn't it?

775
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,930
The sun's getting pretty red.

776
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:11,330
The sun's getting pretty red.

777
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,070
Hmm.

778
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,370
Nice flying, Ace.

779
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,010
Thank you!

780
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,030
Thank you!

781
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:19,850
Um...

782
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,930
Oh, yeah.

783
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,810
We're like... Oh, we're like about...

784
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,910
We're halfway there!

785
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,150
Whoa!

786
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,490
Hmm...

787
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,030
You are in orbit.

788
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,750
Should we try again?

789
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,450
Since we're here?

790
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,270
Squidward on a chair!

791
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,650
I feel like it won't be so long.

792
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,130
I feel like if I go back...

793
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,830
Oh, I...

794
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,970
I might be able to do it.

795
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,670
I'm in orbit with the...

796
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,390
With the thing now, so...

797
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,790
Uh...

798
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,990
Hmm...

799
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,130
Is she doing the DLC?

800
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:05,730
Yes!

801
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,450
I might honestly give up.

802
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,590
If things are so...

803
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,510
If it takes too long...

804
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,530
If I'm so bad at it, I might give up.

805
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,110
I'll be honest.

806
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,930
But I don't want to give up.

807
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,170
Can I get you in there?

808
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,650
Can I just scoot you in real close?

809
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:30,630
Yeah.

810
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,410
There we go!

811
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,670
Nice!

812
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,450
Good la...

813
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:34,670
Ooh!

814
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,630
Snowflake!

815
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,850
Good landing!

816
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,450
Wait, how far... Oh, map.

817
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,030
Okay.

818
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,910
I'll wait till we're a little bit closer.

819
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,210
Probably.

820
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,230
Oh, get the Meditate too?

821
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,950
Okay, I'll get the Meditate too.

822
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,190
We'll have to go back to Giant's Deep then.

823
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:54,670
Hmm...

824
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,670
You can do it?

825
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,050
Thank you!

826
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,170
Look!

827
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,090
It's staying!

828
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,130
Wait, uh... Where do I need to...

829
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,630
Is around here good to stay?

830
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,690
Don't you go now!

831
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,190
Whoa!

832
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,050
I see you drifting!

833
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,310
This ain't no Initial D.

834
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,990
The other end.

835
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,910
Other side.

836
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,310
Okay.

837
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,830
Oh gosh.

838
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,190
Oh!

839
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,690
Oh!

840
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,930
Thank you guys for directing me.

841
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,210
Oh, where the red... where the red is.

842
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,390
Okay, okay.

843
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,960
For anybody coming in being like, Hey, this isn't the DLC.

844
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,160
That's because...

845
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,060
I had to start a new game.

846
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,920
And um...

847
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,520
Okay.

848
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,820
I think we're close, right?

849
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,180
Maybe not close enough.

850
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:57,620
Uh oh.

851
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,000
I had to start a new game.

852
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,900
But to get like the best ending of uh...

853
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,760
I passed it!

854
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,930
Oh, you know where it's at.

855
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,600
Look for the cracks in the rocky area.

856
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,100
Okay.

857
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,240
Cracks in the rocky area.

858
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,100
Cracks in the rocky area.

859
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,440
Oh!

860
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,380
It's starting to melt!

861
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,280
Oh no!

862
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,520
Uh oh.

863
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,260
Here?

864
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,320
Here.

865
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,450
We made it!

866
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,210
Uh oh.

867
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:41,510
Gosh.

868
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,070
Wait.

869
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,150
Okay.

870
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,350
Oh no.

871
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,690
This is where ghost matter is.

872
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,020
That looks like kind of ghost matter-y.

873
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,680
I'm just saying.

874
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,100
Oh no.

875
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,600
Not me.

876
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:00,980
And...

877
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,380
Take a snapshot.

878
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,360
Yep.

879
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:03,660
Okay.

880
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,100
This way!

881
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,640
Okay.

882
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:10,780
Okay.

883
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,060
Uh...

884
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,540
Oh!

885
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,520
Log, log, log!

886
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,860
Log, log, log.

887
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,200
Okay.

888
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,620
I'm receiving much stronger energy readings now that we're beneath the crust.

889
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,340
Whatever it is must lie somewhere below.

890
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,860
Closer to the comet's center.

891
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,120
And I'm starting to think it's more dangerous than we realized.

892
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,080
Clary, can you hear us?

893
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,520
Bye bye, ship.

894
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,500
It's okay.

895
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,400
We're gonna die here anyway.

896
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,720
Yes, but your voices are faint.

897
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,600
I fear we will lose communication entirely if you continue any deeper.

898
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,660
Keep the shuttle warm for us, Clary.

899
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,040
We'll return the moment we identify the source of the energy readings.

900
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,700
I understand, but be cautious, both of you.

901
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,280
Oh!

902
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,740
Oxygen!

903
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,240
Holy!

904
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,600
Okay.

905
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,320
Um...

906
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,320
Oops.

907
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,640
Uh... Where is the ghost matter at?

908
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,800
Oh, me!

909
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,180
So I can go down this one, right?

910
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,940
The ghost matter...

911
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,180
Yeah!

912
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,700
We can go down this one, right?

913
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,880
It's a winner!

914
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,460
Safe.

915
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,740
Let's go, baby.

916
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,960
But be careful.

917
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,780
But be careful.

918
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,860
Don't go too fast.

919
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,200
Don't go too fast.

920
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,480
Don't go too fast.

921
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,480
Don't go too fast.

922
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,580
Avoid the ghost matter!

923
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,420
How do I...

924
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,180
How do I turn my flash... Oh, there we go.

925
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,200
Nice.

926
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Now I think we have to go...

927
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:50,780
Oh!

928
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,300
Above?

929
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,640
Up and beyond?

930
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:01,910
I think?

931
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:03,850
Up?

932
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,210
I'm too scared.

933
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,950
I can't go down the...

934
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,830
Yeah, that's all ghost matter.

935
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,590
Oh, where... It's so hard...

936
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,130
to tell.

937
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,510
It's so hard to tell sometimes.

938
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,490
Maybe I should keep him up there.

939
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,710
That's the ghost matter hole.

940
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,290
That's the ghost matter hole.

941
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:27,850
That's the ghost matter hole.

942
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:27,870
That's the ghost matter hole.

943
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,230
Oh, never mind.

944
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:29,650
Okay.

945
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,290
You would think that a ghost like myself would be...

946
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:34,310
You would think that a ghost like myself would be...

947
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,350
Look!

948
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,830
It even looks like me, doesn't it?

949
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,210
So funny.

950
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,530
Okay, how do I get...

951
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,050
I'm scared.

952
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,370
What if I fall into the hole?

953
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,790
What if I fall into the hole and die?

954
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,690
What if I fall into the hole and die?

955
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:51,730
Okay.

956
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,530
Good job, team.

957
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,360
Any ghost matter around these parts?

958
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,360
Me?

959
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,160
No matter.

960
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,260
Every hole is a goal.

961
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
Where's the ghost matter?

962
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,260
Me?

963
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,620
Hidden matter.

964
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,680
See ya!

965
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:18,980
Oh.

966
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,500
Wait.

967
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,540
Oh!

968
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,180
I don't think I can go down there.

969
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,500
This way?

970
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,120
Or is this where I just came from?

971
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,560
Oh gosh.

972
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,340
Wait.

973
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,020
This looks...

974
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,260
This appears...

975
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,480
Yeah, this is where I just came from.

976
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,620
You have to choose the right path.

977
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,900
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

978
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,040
Ah!

979
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,460
Oh, scary, scary, scary, scary.

980
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,480
Okay, so I have to go right.

981
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,640
Left.

982
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,620
Okay, right.

983
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,180
Left.

984
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,190
I can't tell.

985
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,340
There's ghost matter in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.

986
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:22,860
Ow!

987
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,450
There's the...

988
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,810
Whoa, we're so close to the center.

989
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,070
We might wanna use camera view for this.

990
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,710
Oh, how do I do that again?

991
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,430
Uh...

992
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,350
This one?

993
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,950
Launch mode?

994
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,410
Or...

995
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:43,950
Oh!

996
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,350
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

997
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:46,770
Yes, yes, yes.

998
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,570
Okay, we're gonna have to take this nice and easy, everybody.

999
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,130
Nice and easy.

1000
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:53,770
Nice and easy.

1001
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:54,870
But it was...

1002
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,210
It was left first, right?

1003
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:56,650
Oh gosh.

1004
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,090
No, just kidding.

1005
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,590
I'm too fast!

1006
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,510
I'm too fast!

1007
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,470
Okay, now...

1008
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,410
Okay.

1009
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,210
Okay.

1010
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,450
Okay, we're fine.

1011
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,390
Keep going.

1012
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,730
Slow and steady.

1013
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:14,890
Slow and steady.

1014
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,760
Any ghost matter?

1015
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,460
Where?

1016
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:23,680
Ah!

1017
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,320
Dead body!

1018
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,300
Um...

1019
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,080
We did it!

1020
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,040
Okay.

1021
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,180
Is this a hole?

1022
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,580
Uh...

1023
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,180
Yes, it is.

1024
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,700
I do believe so.

1025
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,280
Okay.

1026
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,160
Okay.

1027
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,560
Whoa.

1028
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,520
I've played this before and even still I'm just like...

1029
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,000
Wow!

1030
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,720
Oh!

1031
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
We can take it back.

1032
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,180
Uh-oh.

1033
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,640
Grab you.

1034
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,000
Oh no!

1035
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,660
Wait, wait, wait!

1036
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,560
Wait, wait, wait!

1037
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,620
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1038
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,970
I'm trying to read it!

1039
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,190
I'm trying to read it!

1040
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:28,230
The spherical casing here...

1041
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,470
Seems to be the source of the energy readings.

1042
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,470
Can I please...

1043
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:33,830
Take you back!

1044
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,350
Okay.

1045
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,390
There we go.

1046
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,770
I'm so sorry.

1047
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,430
I love physics.

1048
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:46,870
Okay.

1049
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,370
Guys, this is an emotional area, okay?

1050
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,270
Wasn't there a button to stop time while reading?

1051
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,950
That's what this is now, so...

1052
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,970
The spherical stone casing here...

1053
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,530
Seems to be the source of the energy readings.

1054
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,950
No, rather the source of what's within the stone.

1055
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,650
I'm detecting some form of exotic matter.

1056
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,890
The stone is muting our energy readings.

1057
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,190
They should be ten times what we're seeing at least.

1058
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,750
Ugh, I just bit my tongue.

1059
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,170
Pie, I don't think we want this matter interacting with us.

1060
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,850
As far as I can tell, direct contact with it would almost certainly be fatal.

1061
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,590
I've never encountered anything like this casing.

1062
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,490
It's all...

1063
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,130
But it's all that's protecting us from what's inside.

1064
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,410
Worse still, this matter is disturbingly volatile.

1065
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,250
I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it.

1066
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:37,590
Pie, whatever the matter inside this stone casing is, it's more than just profoundly unstable.

1067
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,730
It's under tons of pressure.

1068
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,510
Look at this density scan.

1069
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,770
I've never seen anything this tightly compacted before.

1070
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:44,970
What is this?

1071
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,210
Why are you guys sending tongues, huh?

1072
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,130
Oh, because I bit my tongue.

1073
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,490
This is orders of magnitude worse than I'd imagined.

1074
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,730
If this stone were to rupture, the lethal matter within would rapidly expand.

1075
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,230
If this stone were to rupture, the lethal matter within would rapidly expand.

1076
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,750
Completely blanketing this star system almost instantaneously.

1077
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,230
And the pressure is still building as the comet approaches the star system.

1078
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,510
Return to the shuttle right now.

1079
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,170
The rest of our friends need to know that they're in terrible danger.

1080
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,030
Leave your equipment and run.

1081
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,570
What are you doing, Pie?

1082
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,410
The more we know about this alien matter, the better our chances of survival.

1083
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:23,670
Survival.

1084
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,710
I can't speak.

1085
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,690
Sounds like it's about to bust.

1086
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,590
But this thing's busting, man.

1087
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,230
I will learn what I can do.

1088
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,090
Go warn the others.

1089
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,130
Maybe they can construct a shelter somehow.

1090
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,330
Now, Poki!

1091
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,470
All right.

1092
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,170
So, we got this...

1093
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:46,030
information.

1094
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,370
I'm upside down.

1095
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,190
Did I get everything in here, I think?

1096
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,310
Can I...

1097
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,450
Dang it, I missed.

1098
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,170
Interloper?

1099
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,590
Where did I come from?

1100
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,590
Through that hole, I think?

1101
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,150
Yeah.

1102
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,250
It's so beautiful, though.

1103
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,250
Oh, ghost matter.

1104
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:16,850
Look at you.

1105
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,290
Wait, there's a second hole.

1106
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,870
That's a different hole.

1107
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:20,510
Oh, I'm stuck.

1108
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,250
That hole up there is a different hole.

1109
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,630
Oh, that's probably a bad hole.

1110
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,350
Ghost matter hole.

1111
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,250
But I am going to die here anyway.

1112
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:32,950
So...

1113
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,490
We're beautiful and mysterious.

1114
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:40,950
Dang.

1115
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,870
Oh my gosh, that hole is full of me.

1116
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,690
Hazard, hazard.

1117
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,370
Oh no, are you okay?

1118
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,800
I guess we'll just wait it out until we...

1119
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,600
Until 60 seconds left, everybody.

1120
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,080
Until 60 seconds left, everybody.

1121
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,800
Oh, we're by the sun again.

1122
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,460
Never mind.

1123
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,440
I didn't think that it went into the sun.

1124
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:43,540
Okay.

1125
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,900
The Quantum Moon, though, I imagine...

1126
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,980
is going to have a lot of stuff that...

1127
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,060
You know what I mean?

1128
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,960
Because there's all the different...

1129
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,320
There's the Bramble Moon...

1130
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,540
and there's like the...

1131
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,760
There's a lot of stuff...

1132
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,940
Wait, I have to go back to the...

1133
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,720
Frozen Nomai shuttle?

1134
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,940
Or did I get everything that will be...

1135
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,540
needed for the...

1136
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,700
For the DLC?

1137
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,100
But you already have the knowledge.

1138
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,920
Yeah, but apparently if you have it...

1139
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,740
in your logs...

1140
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,940
then there's a different...

1141
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,780
a slightly different outcome...

1142
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,640
of the game.

1143
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,060
You got everything needed?

1144
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:32,560
Okay, cool.

1145
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,400
Thank you, guys.

1146
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:33,740
Thank you.

1147
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,320
Got what you needed from the interloper.

1148
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:36,940
Awesome.

1149
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,440
Um...

1150
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,400
That's enough knowledge for that part.

1151
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,240
Thanks, Jeffrey!

1152
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,060
Sucks that I had to...

1153
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,400
do a whole new game.

1154
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,120
Then I'm wasting a little bit of time.

1155
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,760
But that's okay, because I...

1156
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,620
just enjoy going around...

1157
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,640
so much in this.

1158
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,000
So, let's go find ourselves a...

1159
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,180
Quantum Moon!

1160
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,060
So, don't...

1161
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,460
go to the sun.

1162
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,660
Where would... If I were a Quantum Moon...

1163
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,370
That's not it.

1164
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,450
No, that's Idle Rock.

1165
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,550
If I were a Quantum Moon...

1166
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,210
I'd be right there.

1167
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:26,870
Little recap.

1168
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,170
Yeah, this is good though.

1169
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,340
Okay, so with this...

1170
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,520
I have to take a picture of you.

1171
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,260
Don't go into him.

1172
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,480
Don't fly in!

1173
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,480
Don't fly in!

1174
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,120
Don't touch!

1175
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:47,880
Don't touch!

1176
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,340
Don't touch!

1177
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,020
Okay.

1178
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:55,700
Wait.

1179
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,440
How do I...

1180
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:58,940
Um...

1181
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,900
Unbuckle.

1182
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,670
Photo mode.

1183
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:05,430
Say cheese!

1184
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:06,970
Cheese!

1185
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:08,910
Okay.

1186
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,710
Now I can buckle back...

1187
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,010
Wait.

1188
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:13,610
Oh.

1189
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:16,870
Oh.

1190
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:19,850
Okay.

1191
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:25,170
Oopsie!

1192
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,770
Let's check our map.

1193
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,730
If I were a Quantum Moon...

1194
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,130
Where would I be?

1195
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:38,310
If I were a Quantum Moon...

1196
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:39,250
If I...

1197
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:39,630
Oh, wait.

1198
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:41,870
I just saw the...

1199
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:42,790
Like that other rotation.

1200
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,970
It looks like for the DLC.

1201
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:46,610
Wait.

1202
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,630
Is that...

1203
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:49,830
Power Glass Twins?

1204
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:51,290
Um...

1205
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:54,610
Will it show up on here?

1206
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:55,030
Ah!

1207
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:55,710
No!

1208
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:56,990
Why are you at the Bramble?

1209
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,460
Well, I might have moved by now, actually.

1210
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,060
Where is the Bramble?

1211
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,040
Can I look at my map from here?

1212
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,240
Okay.

1213
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:13,780
You know what?

1214
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:15,580
Good.

1215
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,620
It left the Bramble.

1216
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,840
Where are you now?

1217
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,820
The Bramble.

1218
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,440
Are you at Giant's Seat?

1219
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:22,580
Maybe...

1220
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:24,960
No...

1221
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,770
If I were...

1222
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:33,550
Where are you?

1223
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,840
Where are you?

1224
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,160
Am I blind?

1225
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,980
It will keep moving.

1226
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,040
You gotta find it on...

1227
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,200
Oh!

1228
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:45,740
Oh!

1229
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,180
Oh!

1230
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:46,620
Oh!

1231
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:54,430
Will it... If I lock on...

1232
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,490
Will it keep...

1233
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:58,530
I think I have to go actually look for it.

1234
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:58,730
Ah!

1235
00:47:59,030 --> 00:47:59,390
Ah!

1236
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,070
Oh!

1237
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:00,750
Oh!

1238
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,050
Oh!

1239
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,130
I found it.

1240
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,830
Stop doubting my abilities.

1241
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:14,790
Okay.

1242
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,730
So I can't go in with my ship.

1243
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,760
I'm really close to the sun though.

1244
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,340
I'm kind of scared.

1245
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,860
I'm real close to the...

1246
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,040
I'm real close to the sun.

1247
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,340
Oh!

1248
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:33,640
Oh!

1249
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,340
I'm glad that doesn't count as...

1250
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,680
Okay.

1251
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:37,940
Photo mode.

1252
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:38,940
Take a snapshot.

1253
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:41,060
Why?

1254
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:41,960
Where are you going?

1255
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,200
You can enter on your ship.

1256
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:47,780
Wait.

1257
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,420
How do I...

1258
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:48,740
Okay.

1259
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,740
You guys might need to backseat me a little bit more.

1260
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,120
Cause I'm... I'm confused.

1261
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,160
Your ship has a camera.

1262
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,520
It does!

1263
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,880
There it goes.

1264
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,140
Launch the ship.

1265
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,640
Okay.

1266
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:02,960
Okay.

1267
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,540
Well it's gone now.

1268
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:05,380
So...

1269
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,100
Let's figure out where it went this time.

1270
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,480
We got this.

1271
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,520
So I...

1272
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,060
Launched the scouter on my ship.

1273
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:14,940
And then it should be good.

1274
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:17,460
There.

1275
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,880
Perfect.

1276
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:18,560
Perfect!

1277
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:19,960
Okay.

1278
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,450
It's the exact same controls as the scout launcher.

1279
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:29,830
Okay.

1280
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:30,350
Thank you guys.

1281
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:33,530
Sorry.

1282
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,370
It's been a minute.

1283
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:35,010
It's been a minute.

1284
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,210
Okay.

1285
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,430
I appreciate you being patient with me.

1286
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:39,550
This is good too though.

1287
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,450
Because I'll remember how to do stuff.

1288
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,070
For the DLC too.

1289
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:46,070
So now...

1290
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,110
Did that take a picture?

1291
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,190
I think that's it.

1292
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:56,030
In there, right?

1293
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,590
So...

1294
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:01,410
Is that it?

1295
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,090
Now I'm good?

1296
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,270
So now I can go in?

1297
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,470
Here I go.

1298
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,230
Here I go.

1299
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,510
Full speed!

1300
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:23,450
Okay.

1301
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,930
Now I have to remember...

1302
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,790
So I said some...

1303
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,090
Don't do certain things here.

1304
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,490
Right?

1305
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,450
They were like...

1306
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,070
Don't go to certain areas.

1307
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,130
Whoa!

1308
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:40,110
So scary!

1309
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:41,390
Wait.

1310
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:41,970
It's Y, right?

1311
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,760
Do not jump.

1312
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,440
Where do you think you're going?

1313
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,500
I have to find that one building.

1314
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,800
Go north?

1315
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,160
Okay.

1316
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,300
This... This way.

1317
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:10,820
Wait.

1318
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,920
The ship's fine, everybody!

1319
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,680
The ship's fine!

1320
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,520
Quantum ship.

1321
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,160
Oh!

1322
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:27,520
Oh!

1323
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:27,960
Oh!

1324
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:28,620
Hello!

1325
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,040
Wait.

1326
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,500
We're fine.

1327
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,540
Find the tower.

1328
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:35,860
Oh!

1329
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:36,080
There!

1330
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,100
Is that it?

1331
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,000
Nope.

1332
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,140
That's just a really thick tree.

1333
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,700
Yeah, I'm looking for the tower now.

1334
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,520
Because I know that's where we have to go.

1335
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,020
Did I like land in the worst possible place?

1336
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,400
Is that even possible?

1337
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,260
It's so scary here.

1338
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,880
I'm so excited for the DLC.

1339
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,120
Oh!

1340
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,000
There it is!

1341
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,200
Perfect.

1342
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,760
Now one thing I don't remember...

1343
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,420
Now one thing I don't remember...

1344
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,900
One thing I don't remember...

1345
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,860
Oh, I have to be in this spot, right?

1346
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,820
It has to be in the secret spot?

1347
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,460
Yep.

1348
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:32,700
Okay.

1349
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,220
Cool.

1350
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,380
Oh, let's grab this stuff too, just in case.

1351
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,720
Okay.

1352
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,320
Very nice.

1353
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:39,760
Alright.

1354
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,780
We turn out the lights.

1355
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,640
And we are...

1356
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,460
Not there.

1357
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,040
Can I turn on my flashlight?

1358
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:54,980
Not there.

1359
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,120
Not there.

1360
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,540
Not there.

1361
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,240
There!

1362
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,460
This looks complicated.

1363
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,400
Oh.

1364
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,340
The shrine has to be at the North Pole.

1365
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,180
Oh, shoot.

1366
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,020
How do I...

1367
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,200
Oh, sure, the...

1368
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,880
You have to be at the North Pole first.

1369
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:27,780
Oh, no.

1370
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,520
Wait, so I have to go to the North Pole?

1371
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,320
North Pole before teleporting there.

1372
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,840
Oh, you have to leave the tower in different planets.

1373
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,900
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1374
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:42,550
Let's open.

1375
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:44,230
Let's try here.

1376
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:45,630
Wait, I'm scared.

1377
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:46,830
Isn't this the Bramble World?

1378
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:51,330
Oh, yes.

1379
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,670
Because we can't always get to the North Pole.

1380
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:55,970
But we can here.

1381
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:56,670
Perhaps.

1382
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:57,150
Maybe.

1383
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:58,250
Okay.

1384
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,510
Okay.

1385
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,270
Scary, scary, scary.

1386
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,190
Hope there's no fish around.

1387
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:05,890
Okay, okay, okay.

1388
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,790
It's all coming back to me slowly but surely.

1389
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,310
Slowly but surely.

1390
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,410
Actually, does this work?

1391
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:21,810
I don't think it does.

1392
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,210
I don't think this...

1393
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,510
I don't think this does work.

1394
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,290
We're not entirely at the North Pole.

1395
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,110
We're like mostly at the North Pole.

1396
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:37,670
Made it further.

1397
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,050
Oh, I don't know why I always turn the lights on.

1398
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,350
I have my flashlight.

1399
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:44,230
Okay.

1400
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,310
Maybe here?

1401
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:59,770
Does not...

1402
00:54:59,770 --> 00:54:59,870
Wait.

1403
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,930
Oh, maybe.

1404
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:02,970
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

1405
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,690
Oh, wait.

1406
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:11,210
Not here.

1407
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:11,530
Not quite.

1408
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,190
Wait, I got it?

1409
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,530
What do you mean I got it?

1410
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,850
Oh, this works?

1411
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:18,370
For real?

1412
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:21,150
Oh, hello.

1413
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,630
Oh, goodbye.

1414
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,090
Just spin?

1415
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:27,710
Oh, okay.

1416
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:28,110
Cool.

1417
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:29,630
I'm spinning.

1418
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:30,570
I'm spinning.

1419
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,210
Spinning all around.

1420
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:37,350
Ah!

1421
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:38,370
Yippee!

1422
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:41,770
Okay.

1423
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,690
Thanks, guys, for your help.

1424
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,610
Really, truly appreciate you guys.

1425
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:51,950
Thank you.

1426
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,570
First try, baby.

1427
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:02,670
We're here.

1428
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:04,570
And...

1429
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:08,270
We gotta go talk to somebody.

1430
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:12,370
Speedrun.

1431
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,250
For real, right?

1432
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:19,730
This game is so spooky.

1433
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,430
Hits every good beat.

1434
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,490
Am I going the wrong way?

1435
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:37,520
Oh, wait.

1436
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:38,760
Do I go into the hole?

1437
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,120
Oh, I can't remember.

1438
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,040
You're going right?

1439
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,340
Wait.

1440
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,680
I go into the hole and...

1441
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:44,660
Wait.

1442
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,280
Do not go into the hole.

1443
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:48,680
Okay.

1444
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,120
Not yet.

1445
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,040
Where...

1446
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,060
Where is she?

1447
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,660
Not yet.

1448
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:56,900
Okay.

1449
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,960
Is she close to the hole?

1450
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,000
Found her.

1451
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,280
Found her.

1452
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:04,620
Found her.

1453
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,040
Wow!

1454
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,320
How are you?

1455
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,080
Oh!

1456
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,460
Oh!

1457
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,160
That's right.

1458
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:14,440
Okay.

1459
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,240
This is a lot.

1460
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:15,500
Okay.

1461
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,320
I remember all this.

1462
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:21,440
There's, like, so many things that we're gonna have to, like, mix and match and talk to about.

1463
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,940
Do you guys mind if I, um...

1464
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,840
I don't wanna skip through it.

1465
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,360
But...

1466
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,350
Where do I put it?

1467
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:34,610
Oh, thank you.

1468
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,000
We've heard it before.

1469
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,360
It's okay.

1470
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,380
It's so cool, though.

1471
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,760
It's so awesome.

1472
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,140
Have you encountered a quantum shard on another planet?

1473
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,120
The shards look the same as the quantum moon's surface does now, while at the eye.

1474
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:08,660
From this, we can reasonably infer the quantum moon's natural state is as we see it now, and that the eye is its primary location.

1475
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:11,920
Okay.

1476
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,720
I am gonna skip a little bit through it.

1477
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,580
Ship log updated.

1478
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,020
Okay.

1479
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,200
We updated one thing.

1480
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,240
We're, like...

1481
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:21,580
It's so funny.

1482
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,300
I've done nothing, but we're in endgame.

1483
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,340
Okay.

1484
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,460
Find the eye.

1485
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,500
I'm unsure how you arrived here.

1486
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:30,680
Yes, yes, yes.

1487
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,900
Very good.

1488
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,060
Speed lore.

1489
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,620
Fundamental uncertainty throughout the universe.

1490
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,200
The eye.

1491
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:42,960
Oh my gosh.

1492
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,780
Can't wait to do more about the eye.

1493
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,520
Quantum moon probably exhibits macroscopic quantum behavior because of its proximity to the eye.

1494
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,520
Blah, blah, blah.

1495
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,540
Blah, blah, blah.

1496
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,900
And then your clan died.

1497
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,100
So sad.

1498
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,180
But it's not from the eye.

1499
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,640
It's from the ghost matter.

1500
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,980
I am on my first pilgrimage to the quantum moon.

1501
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,440
All know Maya and my clan make this journey when we come of age.

1502
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,460
This goes so crazy.

1503
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,380
I will be so scared.

1504
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,600
Okay.

1505
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,400
Now we switch it out.

1506
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,640
From explanation to identify stone.

1507
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,380
Okey dokey.

1508
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,740
Identify me.

1509
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,360
Solanumbus girl.

1510
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,960
Never met one of your kind before.

1511
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,320
It's an honor to speak with you.

1512
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,420
I particularly admire your four eyes.

1513
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,380
You call me a nerd?

1514
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,540
Hey there, four eyes.

1515
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,500
There are many questions I would ask if I could comprehend your language.

1516
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,140
You have my gratitude for understanding mine.

1517
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,560
What if I didn't understand it?

1518
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,560
What if I just was like...

1519
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:10,270
Stop using that emote.

1520
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,530
This is the quantum moon.

1521
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,170
Where we are both standing.

1522
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:18,810
Despite also orbiting other celestial bodies, the quantum moon is the eye of the universe's moon.

1523
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:20,730
Oh my brain.

1524
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,270
I forgot how much this was like.

1525
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,350
This game makes my brain go...

1526
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,510
I am Solanum.

1527
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:29,990
Anomai.

1528
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:34,010
My clan arrived in this star system before my birth and we now call it home.

1529
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:40,630
Yes, they were searching for the eye and they ended up in the bramble.

1530
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,890
Right?

1531
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:50,290
And then they all went to like the different planets and kind of set up base there but then the interloper caused them to all die.

1532
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:50,690
Right?

1533
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,510
Why you don't have a nerd emote?

1534
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,430
What are you talking about?

1535
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:03,510
My otaku...

1536
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:08,110
My otaku emote is the nerd emote.

1537
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:12,670
Sorry, I am eating my dinner.

1538
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,650
You can make stones of the same color?

1539
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:17,930
You can?

1540
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:28,070
We are orbiting the eye of the universe now.

1541
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,030
Although we cannot see it.

1542
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,010
Only the quantum moon's reflection of it.

1543
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:37,730
The eye is older than the universe itself and my clan believes it dwells in an extremely distant orbit around this solar system.

1544
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:48,870
Otaku.

1545
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,870
Suppose... suppose you could reach the eye of the universe.

1546
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,570
Would you try to enter it?

1547
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:01,010
What do you imagine the effects of a conscious observer might be?

1548
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:03,350
Freaky.

1549
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:04,730
So freaky.

1550
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:09,550
Hey Mint, hello!

1551
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:15,690
Imagine you've noticed the quantum moon changes in appearance depending on which location it is currently orbiting.

1552
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:16,670
For instance, yes.

1553
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:25,110
So we knew that, but because the quantum moon clearly changes in its different forms, the eye in this moon's primary location must be similarly malleable.

1554
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:29,790
From this we can hypothesize that the eye represents extreme changeability.

1555
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:37,850
That said, despite its malleable nature, the quantum moon becomes locked to one specific version of itself when it is consciously observed.

1556
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:41,550
But what would happen if a conscious observer were to enter the eye?

1557
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,850
Wait, which ones have I been switching out?

1558
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:46,970
Oh shoot.

1559
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,750
Wait.

1560
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,750
I don't... this one, right?

1561
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,310
This one.

1562
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:55,290
Right?

1563
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:56,410
I think so.

1564
01:02:59,410 --> 01:02:59,810
Okay.

1565
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:01,830
Give me more text!

1566
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:03,770
Speak!

1567
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:05,050
Speak you!

1568
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,820
Like many of the clan before me, I journeyed here to see the quantum moon's reflection of the eye.

1569
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,540
This is the closest any of us have come to seeing the eye itself.

1570
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,820
You may think I'm strange, but I have a hypothesis that I may not be entirely alive.

1571
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,880
Perhaps my journey has reached its end.

1572
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,440
Oh, shiplock.

1573
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,260
Okay, good, good, good, good.

1574
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,840
Say it, don't spry it.

1575
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,000
Oh, I swapped the other one?

1576
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:32,260
Oh.

1577
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:34,720
It's okay.

1578
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:35,900
Cause, uh...

1579
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,220
I'm just gonna get all of them cause I don't know what we need and what we don't need.

1580
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,000
Kao!

1581
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,840
Welcome to membership, thank you!

1582
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,660
Is this your first time on the quantum moon?

1583
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,760
It's my first time here.

1584
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,260
If you've come here looking for answers, I hope you find them.

1585
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:51,580
Oof.

1586
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,220
I'm left with so many questions.

1587
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,880
Did I do this one?

1588
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,420
I like dropping them on the floor to keep track.

1589
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,120
That's a good idea.

1590
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:05,980
Okay.

1591
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,100
We'll put that there then.

1592
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,820
But it looks so pretty up on there, right?

1593
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,040
Up on the wall instead?

1594
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,320
Okay, we've gotten this one.

1595
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:20,420
Uh, we probably haven't done this one and this one, right?

1596
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:22,820
You.

1597
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,200
You!

1598
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,960
Many of my clan have believed the eye called to us for a particular purpose.

1599
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:34,440
When I was a child, I used to believe the eye was malevolent.

1600
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,200
To have lured my clan to the star system only to then vanish from them so completely.

1601
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,940
But I don't fear the eye anymore.

1602
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:44,380
In fact, it became my fondest hope to see the eye itself someday.

1603
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,020
But I fear this may be beyond my reach.

1604
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,260
You may think I'm strange, but I have a hypothesis.

1605
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,680
That I may not...

1606
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:51,760
Oh.

1607
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:52,420
Okay.

1608
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:52,800
Yes.

1609
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,140
Maybe I got all of them now.

1610
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,060
Maybe I got all of them now.

1611
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:06,820
Just kidding.

1612
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,680
We do not have much connection, you and I.

1613
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,340
Still, this encounter feels special.

1614
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,040
I hope you won't mind if I think of you as a friend.

1615
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:15,900
My friend!

1616
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:16,900
My friend!

1617
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
My friend!

1618
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,560
An eye-pothesis?

1619
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,020
Oh!

1620
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,140
Okay.

1621
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,900
I think we got everything now.

1622
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:29,720
Maybe.

1623
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:30,940
Hopefully.

1624
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:34,560
Yes.

1625
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,700
Oh, my brain is hurting.

1626
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:41,160
From which ones I've put up here and which ones I haven't.

1627
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,380
It's my birthday!

1628
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,780
Chaotic's so happy birthday!

1629
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,880
Happy birthday to you.

1630
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,380
Happy birthday to you.

1631
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,340
Happy birthday dear Chaotic Snow.

1632
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,840
Happy birthday to you.

1633
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,600
Happy birthday dear Chaotic Snow.

1634
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,080
Okay.

1635
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,280
Now I think we've gotten all of them.

1636
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:13,840
Probably.

1637
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,260
I think so.

1638
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,420
What if I do these two?

1639
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,150
Oh, my gosh.

1640
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,610
Wait, it worked.

1641
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,880
These are the two tenets of Nomai philosophy.

1642
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,320
To seek out and to understand is our way of living.

1643
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:34,540
Oh.

1644
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,300
Okay.

1645
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:38,660
Nerds.

1646
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,780
I think that's actually...

1647
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,860
I'm too paranoid.

1648
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,160
Okay.

1649
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,280
Let's do it all over again, I suppose.

1650
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:57,730
Okay.

1651
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,180
I think you got it with the last log update.

1652
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:06,740
Okay.

1653
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,120
I'm just doing one last check.

1654
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,040
You can fly into the eye shadow to find the quantum shuttle if you want.

1655
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:27,780
There's an additional scene if you can visit if you can get to wait, can get if you visit the ship mural in Brittle Hollow.

1656
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,380
Oh, okay.

1657
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:38,080
Last thing to do is visit the mural in the vessel in the black hole planet or visit the vessel in Bramble.

1658
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:39,860
You should totally visit Bramble.

1659
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,980
Wait, is it Brittle Hollow or Bramble?

1660
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,140
Wait, vessel in the black hole planet.

1661
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:53,890
Oh, either one?

1662
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:57,090
Brittle Bramble?

1663
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,990
Vessel is in the Bramble.

1664
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,530
You just need to know what happened to the vessel.

1665
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:05,350
Both works but the vessel takes longer.

1666
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:07,610
Brittle Hollow is easier.

1667
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:09,630
Wait.

1668
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,510
I don't quite remember where it is.

1669
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,070
I think I've got all of these.

1670
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,670
Now, let's not make a mess.

1671
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:17,610
Let's clean up our...

1672
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:20,630
Nice.

1673
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:22,650
Let's clean up our mess.

1674
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:32,670
Made in action.

1675
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,170
It's in my DNA!

1676
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:38,330
If I even have that anymore.

1677
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:46,530
Go to the mural in the vessel at the black hole inside of the Bramble.

1678
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:48,510
Oh.

1679
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:51,050
I think it's time.

1680
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:54,090
Wait.

1681
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,470
Solanum!

1682
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:56,690
Wait!

1683
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:58,490
Wait!

1684
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,230
No!

1685
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:04,670
You have to...

1686
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,190
You can escape with me!

1687
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,050
Come on!

1688
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:09,670
Just hop on my ship!

1689
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:10,870
Thank you for the...

1690
01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:12,970
This is a red...

1691
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,610
As the sun...

1692
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:24,780
There's a special ending here?

1693
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:25,500
Really?

1694
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,460
Oh my gosh.

1695
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,060
Hug it out.

1696
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,860
So close.

1697
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,100
So cute.

1698
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:37,340
You...

1699
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,200
You're so close.

1700
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,200
Hold on.

1701
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,520
I'm gonna get a picture of the two of us.

1702
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:51,780
Wait.

1703
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,320
Launch it.

1704
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,540
Launch it.

1705
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:53,920
Oh.

1706
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:54,640
Launch it.

1707
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,460
Get it closer.

1708
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:03,980
A little closer.

1709
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:06,760
Yay!

1710
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,480
Yay!

1711
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:12,460
One second.

1712
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,720
I'll read your Akasupa in just a second.

1713
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:16,840
Friends.

1714
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:26,450
Just the two of us.

1715
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,090
We can make it if we try.

1716
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:30,110
Just the...

1717
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:31,790
Two of us.

1718
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,470
You and I.

1719
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:38,690
Our last memory.

1720
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:40,610
So cute.

1721
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,520
Lots of...

1722
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,600
Lots of quantum stuff.

1723
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,900
I did talk to Gabriel.

1724
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,540
I have to go talk to him again.

1725
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,720
Thank you for reminding me.

1726
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:00,000
Yes, because I was recommended to get the...

1727
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,320
Give me one second.

1728
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,180
I was recommended to get the Meditate.

1729
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:06,900
As is the sun.

1730
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,780
You hear that music?

1731
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,240
The end times have come.

1732
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,500
Why is it so sad?

1733
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,060
Thank you so much.

1734
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,180
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1735
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:15,760
Thank you.

1736
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:17,700
Okay.

1737
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,140
Alrighty.

1738
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,800
Yeah, we gotta go talk to...

1739
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,400
Garbo.

1740
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,400
No, his name is Gabro.

1741
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,120
Okay.

1742
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,540
So, I should go talk to him.

1743
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,920
And I should go...

1744
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,260
To... wait.

1745
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,940
Bramble or Brittle Hollow?

1746
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:44,720
I don't wanna go to...

1747
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,760
I'm scared of Brittle Hollow.

1748
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:49,780
Where is...

1749
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,800
Where are we going?

1750
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:57,400
Um...

1751
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,260
Quantum Moon.

1752
01:11:59,060 --> 01:11:59,900
Brittle Hollow?

1753
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:00,980
Is easier?

1754
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:01,420
Okay.

1755
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,200
Where are you?

1756
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,760
There you are!

1757
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,640
Giant's Deep is kind of a pain in the butt to get around though.

1758
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,880
Because it's so gravity heavy.

1759
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,420
I think you can do Brittle and Gabro in the same loop.

1760
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,460
That's what I'm gonna try.

1761
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:29,940
I'm gonna try.

1762
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,480
I'm gonna...

1763
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,320
There will be an attempt.

1764
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:38,850
Alright.

1765
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,210
Go on in, baby!

1766
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:43,210
Okay.

1767
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:44,730
Meow.

1768
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:47,230
Oh, learning...

1769
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:48,010
Ow!

1770
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:50,550
Okay.

1771
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:54,830
It ends the loop if I learn the meditation?

1772
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:55,470
Uh-oh.

1773
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:00,970
Where is he?

1774
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,730
Oh my goodness.

1775
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,410
I hope he wasn't there.

1776
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:10,030
Because he sure is gone now.

1777
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:18,590
Oh, there he is.

1778
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:25,880
Oh!

1779
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:26,620
Whoops!

1780
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:27,820
Ah, it's fine.

1781
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,360
As long as I can get out.

1782
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:30,660
Unbuckle.

1783
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,080
Nice.

1784
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:38,320
Out!

1785
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,020
Oh, there he is.

1786
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,300
All good, everybody.

1787
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,920
I was hoping you'd be back.

1788
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,220
Something really weird is going on.

1789
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,680
You think we're in a time loop?

1790
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,500
Definitely in a time loop.

1791
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:55,960
Yeah, that makes sense.

1792
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:56,240
Cool.

1793
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,440
What do you think it was?

1794
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:04,200
I figured it'd be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn't really thinking about what's happening to the shape of time, you know?

1795
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:05,400
But a loop makes sense here.

1796
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:06,700
Let's go with loop for now.

1797
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:12,580
So it looks like you and I are the only ones who know we're in a time loop.

1798
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,820
And even if you tell them about it, no one remembers by the next loop.

1799
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:16,680
What's with that?

1800
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:20,840
Maybe it's because we both made some seriously intense eye contact with a Nomai statue.

1801
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1802
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:24,300
Um...

1803
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:27,500
I found something?

1804
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:28,940
Uh...

1805
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,920
My time buddy's back.

1806
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:32,580
Wait...

1807
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:38,110
Oh...

1808
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:40,410
I have to come back on the next loop.

1809
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:40,850
Okay.

1810
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,250
You have to unlock...

1811
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,230
Visit him twice.

1812
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:49,850
Dang!

1813
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:51,150
That's okay.

1814
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:52,730
Let's fix the ship.

1815
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:55,130
Oh...

1816
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:56,150
Oh...

1817
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:57,210
Uh...

1818
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:59,730
Let's fix the ship.

1819
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:02,170
And then...

1820
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,350
We'll head over...

1821
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:05,190
Oh, can I even get up there?

1822
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:07,470
Uh-oh.

1823
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:12,350
Let's wait until we go into outer space.

1824
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:22,530
Uh...

1825
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:25,490
We might be going into outer space like right now.

1826
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,100
Beam me up, Scotty!

1827
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:36,020
Right here!

1828
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,080
Right now!

1829
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,280
Here we go!

1830
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,220
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1831
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:44,840
Go, go, go!

1832
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:45,780
Wait!

1833
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,120
Oh, God.

1834
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:50,800
Oh, God.

1835
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:51,940
No, no, no, no.

1836
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:52,520
Up, up, up, up.

1837
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:52,940
Okay.

1838
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:53,980
I'm a genius.

1839
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:54,500
I'm a genius.

1840
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:54,880
I'm a genius.

1841
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,300
I'm a genius, everybody.

1842
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:01,800
I'm a genius, everybody.

1843
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:01,880
Okay.

1844
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:02,840
Buckle up.

1845
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,340
And let's leave.

1846
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:09,110
Perfect.

1847
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:11,050
Perfect execution.

1848
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,220
We only have a few cracks on our screen.

1849
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:23,540
Okay, not there.

1850
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,080
Um...

1851
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:26,220
Uh-oh.

1852
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:26,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1853
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:27,880
We're coming in high.

1854
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,800
We're coming in a little bit high there.

1855
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,020
There it is.

1856
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,280
I have no idea where to go, though.

1857
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,140
Truthfully, I have no idea where to go for this mural.

1858
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,000
Did you drop your phone?

1859
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,440
Nice crosshair.

1860
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,240
It's near the drop.

1861
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,720
Look for the escape pod.

1862
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,020
Look for the beacon.

1863
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,500
Try to land near the escape pod.

1864
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,160
I don't remember.

1865
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,120
I don't remember where that is.

1866
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,120
Emergency beacon.

1867
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,160
Okay, I'm looking for a beacon.

1868
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,300
Use the signal scope.

1869
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:08,640
Okay.

1870
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,420
To locate the emergency beacon.

1871
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:11,460
Thank you.

1872
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:14,780
That's what we shall try to do.

1873
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:15,980
Unless it's...

1874
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,520
No, that's the launcher.

1875
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,260
Right there.

1876
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1877
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:23,740
Whoa.

1878
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,860
We came in hot, hot.

1879
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,500
Oh, dang.

1880
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,760
There we go.

1881
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:30,140
Nice.

1882
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,960
That was probably the best landing I think I've ever done in my career.

1883
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:41,820
That was probably the absolute best landing I've ever done ever.

1884
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,420
That's pretty impressive.

1885
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:44,380
I would say.

1886
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:46,980
Nice.

1887
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,720
Okay, let's not die.

1888
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,020
Alright.

1889
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:49,660
Signal scope.

1890
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,820
That's not it.

1891
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:02,330
But that's all.

1892
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:03,770
No.

1893
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:05,610
Change the frequency?

1894
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,630
That?

1895
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:28,040
Might be good to go visit our banjo friend though for some oxygen.

1896
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:31,000
Oh my gosh.

1897
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,260
Wait, that's the quantum rock?

1898
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,020
What does it sound like instead?

1899
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,560
Museum shard.

1900
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:38,000
Haha.

1901
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,180
What?

1902
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,460
Oh my goodness.

1903
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:44,840
Why am I so bad at this?

1904
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:46,640
What?

1905
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:51,470
Why am I so...

1906
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:52,690
Uh...

1907
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:54,130
Change the frequency.

1908
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,410
Oh no, I don't think I have it.

1909
01:18:58,270 --> 01:18:59,910
Oh no, I don't think I have the frequency.

1910
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:00,710
Uh oh.

1911
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:03,410
Oh shoot.

1912
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:09,870
We're just gonna...

1913
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,990
go around and...

1914
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:15,850
Oh wait, we can get some oxygen here.

1915
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:18,610
And some fuel and stuff.

1916
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:23,150
That'll be good.

1917
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,150
Guess we zoom.

1918
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:28,430
We just gotta find the mural, right?

1919
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:31,410
We just gotta get to the mural.

1920
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:33,890
Where is your oxygen?

1921
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:35,350
Ouch.

1922
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:39,030
Didn't mean to go down so hard.

1923
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,750
Or your fuel I meant.

1924
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:43,650
I keep... I think I keep saying oxygen.

1925
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:44,750
What the heck is that?

1926
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:46,770
Space egg.

1927
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,980
Where's your fuel?

1928
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,840
Is there none here?

1929
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:05,700
Okay.

1930
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,620
Let's just keep moving then.

1931
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,180
Okay, I'm gonna go along the equator.

1932
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,100
Okay, I'm gonna go along the equator.

1933
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,740
I think we can do it.

1934
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,060
I think we can do it.

1935
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,040
If not, um...

1936
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:30,640
That's okay though.

1937
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,160
Boom, boom, boom.

1938
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,300
This is the cannon.

1939
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:42,900
This is the cannon.

1940
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,200
Searching my ship is probably faster.

1941
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,860
Yeah, but did you see that landing?

1942
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:48,280
Yeah, but did you see that landing?

1943
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,240
It's fine.

1944
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,080
It didn't take us that long to get to Gabbro and...

1945
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:01,700
You know.

1946
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,180
We're getting more oxygen.

1947
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,500
It's all good, baby.

1948
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,580
But after this I will...

1949
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,080
Well, I gotta get to meditate.

1950
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,340
And then we'll do the DLC.

1951
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,200
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1952
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:25,940
Maybe I should have just played on my other account.

1953
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,520
Wait, is that it?

1954
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,580
Do I see it with my...

1955
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:32,620
eyes?

1956
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,520
I believe!

1957
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:41,540
But this has been a great way to kind of reintroduce myself back to the...

1958
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,760
Back to the game.

1959
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:51,570
Okay, so down here, right?

1960
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:55,670
Uh-oh.

1961
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:58,170
I don't have much fuel.

1962
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,550
Follow the platforms below.

1963
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:02,050
Okay.

1964
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:04,890
Uh, how do I get...

1965
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:07,390
to the platform?

1966
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,010
Which is a great question.

1967
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,300
I know these drop.

1968
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:17,400
Like, some of them break down, you know?

1969
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:20,320
So I'm kind of nervous to just drop down.

1970
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:21,640
Okay.

1971
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:25,260
Please don't break!

1972
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,000
Ah!

1973
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:32,440
Okay.

1974
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:33,040
We're fine!

1975
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:33,820
Everything's fine!

1976
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:39,780
Made it!

1977
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:40,680
Okay.

1978
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,360
This way.

1979
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,220
Let's keep going.

1980
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,190
Where do I go from here?

1981
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:04,430
Mural should be in the lower section of here.

1982
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:07,770
So, like...

1983
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,320
Oh gosh.

1984
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,340
I don't wanna go...

1985
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,620
I don't wanna go into the...

1986
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,460
To the black hole.

1987
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,080
Down here, maybe?

1988
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:30,900
Everybody backseating?

1989
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:31,520
Thank you.

1990
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,660
Maybe I shouldn't even say backseating.

1991
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:34,340
You're just helping.

1992
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,220
Drop below here.

1993
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:36,740
Okay.

1994
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:38,720
Oh no!

1995
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,960
Oh no, I can't make it in.

1996
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:41,700
Oh gosh.

1997
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:42,660
Uh...

1998
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:50,510
Why are you sideways?

1999
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:57,620
So I have to go in here.

2000
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,280
Oh, I see it.

2001
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,680
Oh, shoot.

2002
01:23:59,680 --> 01:23:59,920
Okay.

2003
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:03,600
Um... I'm gonna grab this too.

2004
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:04,040
Just in case.

2005
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:10,790
How do I get down there?

2006
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,950
You can just walk around.

2007
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,310
I can.

2008
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:27,390
Like so?

2009
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:28,530
If I drop down here?

2010
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:29,210
Will I make it?

2011
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:29,810
Or...

2012
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:31,170
Oh...

2013
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:32,330
Okay.

2014
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,130
Risking it for the biscuit.

2015
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:35,250
I guess.

2016
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:42,130
Ouch!

2017
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:42,730
We're fine!

2018
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:44,410
Oh, nice!

2019
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:44,730
Nice!

2020
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:51,870
Why did the vessel crash in that place?

2021
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,430
Mm-hmm.

2022
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:55,730
Was the vessel unwell?

2023
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,650
Probably not the vessel, but the destination.

2024
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:03,350
I'm afraid for our friends in escape pod 3.

2025
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:05,690
And...

2026
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:06,730
Yippee!

2027
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:09,330
Okay.

2028
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:10,350
And we get all these too.

2029
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:12,150
Okay, good, good, good.

2030
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:12,910
Alright.

2031
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:13,850
Vessel...

2032
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:14,730
It's for I.

2033
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:17,470
Vessel trapped in Bramble.

2034
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:20,490
Escape from Bramble.

2035
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:21,670
To other planets.

2036
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:23,690
Nice little summary.

2037
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:27,310
Okay.

2038
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:29,670
DLC start-o!

2039
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:31,170
Lore get!

2040
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:31,970
Yay!

2041
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:32,890
Thank you guys!

2042
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:34,410
Thank you for your patience!

2043
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:35,590
Thank you for helping me out!

2044
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:38,570
Um... We're gonna do one more.

2045
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:40,050
Look at my ship.

2046
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:44,010
I love this view.

2047
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:46,710
Tori!

2048
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:48,170
Welcome to Mambooship.

2049
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:48,710
Very cool!

2050
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:51,370
We're gonna do one last loop.

2051
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:52,810
Because we're gonna get meditate.

2052
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,310
And then we shall go for the...

2053
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:56,290
DLC.

2054
01:25:58,130 --> 01:25:59,570
Thank you for the summary, boss.

2055
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:00,150
Of course!

2056
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,010
Don't thank me.

2057
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:05,010
I'm just gonna die in space.

2058
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:07,270
We'll have no fuel.

2059
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:09,350
How close can I get to the sun?

2060
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:17,250
Openly discussing a backstage in a game like this for a bit has been an unusual experience, but also fun.

2061
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:26,270
It is weird for me too because usually I'd be like No no no don't tell me anything But it's all stuff that I've experienced before so it's just kind of like...

2062
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:26,990
whatever.

2063
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:28,870
You know.

2064
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:31,730
It's just kind of whatever.

2065
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:31,850
Whatever.

2066
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:40,570
It's just getting it so that we can proceed forward.

2067
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:50,880
You will hit the sun before you run out of oxygen?

2068
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:51,380
Perfect.

2069
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,580
Will we though?

2070
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:54,800
I'm almost out of fuel.

2071
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,420
But maybe I have enough...

2072
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:08,410
Maybe I have enough momentum to launch me.

2073
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:09,650
Into the sun!

2074
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:12,290
Here we go.

2075
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:14,250
Everybody shield your eyes.

2076
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:15,630
It's so bright.

2077
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:17,490
I'm touching grass!

2078
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:22,990
Perfect.

2079
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:46,520
Nice.

2080
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:48,100
Okay.

2081
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,000
To you.

2082
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,580
To you.

2083
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:54,660
Yes, my love.

2084
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,700
To you.

2085
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:58,060
Don't go anywhere.

2086
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,300
Don't go anywhere.

2087
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:08,160
Thank you for the five gifted.

2088
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,700
Thank you.

2089
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,080
Thank you.

2090
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,480
Stay with me.

2091
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:26,630
I'm gonna go grab that meditator.

2092
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:31,570
It's so crazy how like you could literally just...

2093
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:33,070
speedrun this game.

2094
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:37,110
If you just know where to go.

2095
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:41,570
If you know the secret of the Quantum Moon, you can be like...

2096
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:42,690
Yeah.

2097
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:43,630
Oh, there it is!

2098
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:44,510
Hey, Quantum Moon.

2099
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:47,510
Bye, Quantum Moon.

2100
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,110
Current record is like six minutes.

2101
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:53,770
That's crazy.

2102
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:58,150
Wowee.

2103
01:28:58,230 --> 01:28:58,970
Oh, there he is.

2104
01:28:59,150 --> 01:28:59,530
Perfect.

2105
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:00,970
Land.

2106
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:01,930
Land.

2107
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,090
Oh, not in the trees again.

2108
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:04,590
Come on.

2109
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:06,070
Don't do this to me.

2110
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:08,650
Okay.

2111
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:11,510
Perfect.

2112
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:13,870
Great landing.

2113
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:18,590
Give me the meditator, man.

2114
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:22,990
They also run it shipless?

2115
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,370
Is that even possible?

2116
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:30,090
How do you get out of... How do you get off of Timberhurst?

2117
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:32,350
My time, buddy.

2118
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:37,350
How do you stay so calm in the face of repeating and ending death?

2119
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:38,770
Deep breaths.

2120
01:29:39,070 --> 01:29:39,990
Seriously, I meditate.

2121
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:41,010
Want me to teach you?

2122
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:41,970
Sure.

2123
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:43,330
Close your eyes.

2124
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:44,330
Ah, here we go.

2125
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:46,270
Physics?

2126
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:50,270
Wait until you find out about suitless.

2127
01:29:50,330 --> 01:29:50,730
What?

2128
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:53,210
That doesn't seem possible.

2129
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:03,760
Oh my god.

2130
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:08,200
An hour and thirty minutes into the stream and we're finally getting to the DLC, baby.

2131
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,300
Okay, let's go find that radio tower.

2132
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,280
Which I'm just going to use the spaceship.

2133
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,460
Hmm.

2134
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:33,920
I'm just using the spaceship.

2135
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:36,160
There's a geyser.

2136
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,360
And why is this planet so flat?

2137
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,020
Besides, like, some mountains and...

2138
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,600
Let's see.

2139
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:50,820
I have such a delicate touch, don't I?

2140
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,840
Being able to fly so... easy.

2141
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,040
Oh.

2142
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:56,560
Wait.

2143
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:01,940
Is this it?

2144
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,040
No.

2145
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:10,740
This is...

2146
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:16,820
What's up there?

2147
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,220
It's a tree, boss?

2148
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:22,100
Okay.

2149
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:32,710
What are you saying?

2150
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:36,650
What does that mean?

2151
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:42,730
Okay.

2152
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:44,510
I think I remember this forest.

2153
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:46,310
It has like...

2154
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:49,270
There's like one forest where the trees are also kind of quantum-y.

2155
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:55,550
If I were a radio tower...

2156
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:57,290
You'd think it would be way easier to see.

2157
01:31:57,890 --> 01:31:59,890
Maybe I should go into space a little bit more.

2158
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:02,050
Wait.

2159
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:03,190
Aha!

2160
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:04,870
I'm sideways.

2161
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:12,350
It's good landing.

2162
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:15,610
No panic at all.

2163
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,580
The quantum grove, yeah.

2164
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,300
Yeah, it's pretty freaky in there.

2165
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,180
Hello!

2166
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,860
Hello, hello!

2167
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,360
Hello, hello!

2168
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,900
I've seen that before.

2169
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,180
I've seen that before.

2170
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:45,390
And we're recording!

2171
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:46,370
Ahem!

2172
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:51,690
It's been two days since the launch of the Deep Space Satellite, and I'm about to view the first batch of photos.

2173
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:58,090
Let the record show that on this historic day, Outer Wilds Ventures has...

2174
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:58,510
Ah!

2175
01:32:58,810 --> 01:32:59,370
They're printing!

2176
01:32:59,530 --> 01:32:59,850
They're printing!

2177
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:00,330
Here they come!

2178
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,990
Stars above, will you look at that!

2179
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:05,150
There's Brittle Hollow!

2180
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:06,350
And look, look there!

2181
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:07,830
That's Hollow's Lantern!

2182
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:09,210
And there's Giant's Deep!

2183
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:11,510
And... and the Quantum Moon!

2184
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:12,750
I'm speechless.

2185
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:14,070
Completely speechless!

2186
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:21,190
Every single astral body... wait, if we had a picture of Quantum Moon this whole time, why is it still moving around?

2187
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:31,010
Every single astral body in our magnificent solar system, looking stunning from every angle in each of these three images.

2188
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:34,390
Because nobody was looking at the picture.

2189
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,350
Oh, I guess that's fair.

2190
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,670
And in color, no less.

2191
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:39,890
Now this is art.

2192
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,530
I could stare at these photos forever.

2193
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:44,050
Doesn't Timber Hearth look tiny from?

2194
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:45,330
Hold on.

2195
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:46,530
What is that?

2196
01:33:47,370 --> 01:33:48,330
That can't be right.

2197
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:50,330
That's... I mean, that's not even possible.

2198
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:55,090
Am I interrupting this... oh, inter... interpreting this photo correctly?

2199
01:33:55,790 --> 01:34:00,070
What's even stranger is, it doesn't show up in either of the other photos.

2200
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,110
Just this one.

2201
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,360
Well, there must have been an equipment malfunction, I suppose.

2202
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,560
Only sensible explanation for it.

2203
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:13,160
I'll radio Gabbro and ask them to go examine the satellite's lens for defects.

2204
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,880
Oh god, he scared me again.

2205
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:21,240
Wait, something... that doesn't show up?

2206
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,240
That only shows up in one of them.

2207
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,700
Only... something that only shows up in one of them.

2208
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:33,180
Besides Gabbro.

2209
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:45,990
That's... Timber Hearth.

2210
01:34:46,010 --> 01:34:48,230
No, that's Tim... wait, no, yeah, that's Brittle Hollow.

2211
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:49,090
That's Timber Hearth.

2212
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:53,390
Huh?

2213
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:59,070
Hearth, there's a secret scene if you go bramble and touch fish.

2214
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:00,290
I'm... not fish.

2215
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:00,890
Is true.

2216
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:02,350
Sorry for... you're okay.

2217
01:35:04,210 --> 01:35:08,810
It only shows up in one of the... okay, so we... okay, our first puzzle, everybody!

2218
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:09,610
Woohoo!

2219
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:16,910
Is it... that?

2220
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:18,410
Little dot?

2221
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,620
Yeah, it's not... he... is it...

2222
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,320
And that's Timber Hearth, so...

2223
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:34,260
That tiny little dot?

2224
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:37,940
That's your crosshair?

2225
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:38,220
No!

2226
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:41,820
No!

2227
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,560
How... I wish I could observe it more closely.

2228
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,820
There's the... yeah, cause there's the Quantum Moon.

2229
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:02,230
And it's not here.

2230
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:04,790
Cause this is Timber Hearth.

2231
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:07,430
And that's our... that's Attle Rock.

2232
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,640
And that's us, Attle Rock.

2233
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:14,520
It's the only thing that I can see different.

2234
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:23,630
Where's my ship?

2235
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:25,370
Uh-oh.

2236
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:26,010
Uh-oh.

2237
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:27,270
Oh, there it is.

2238
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:27,770
Okay.

2239
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:33,870
I'm gonna put on my suit and see if anything changes when I put it on.

2240
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:33,910
Hold on.

2241
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:40,830
Okay.

2242
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:43,650
A rapidly white dot.

2243
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:45,830
Yeah, totally.

2244
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:49,230
Okay.

2245
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:52,430
I see you guys smiling.

2246
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:56,890
No spoilers, no hints, no nothing.

2247
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:21,010
20 meters?

2248
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:25,950
Deep Space Radio.

2249
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:26,610
Oh.

2250
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:27,890
Neat.

2251
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:39,950
What is that?

2252
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,760
Is it a quantum thing so I have to take a picture and observe it?

2253
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,540
Why is it so dark there?

2254
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,050
There's Quantum Moon.

2255
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:13,670
Oh my gosh.

2256
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:26,430
That's Attle Rock.

2257
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:28,290
That's brittle.

2258
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:29,750
That's...

2259
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:31,110
Hi, Quantum Moon.

2260
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:35,650
It's always so fun to say hello to the Quantum Moon.

2261
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:37,350
I don't know why.

2262
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:42,230
Wait, so...

2263
01:38:44,630 --> 01:38:46,110
Gabbro will always be spoopy.

2264
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:47,630
It's true.

2265
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:56,310
It's gotta be that, right?

2266
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:59,430
Because it's the only thing that seems different in all these photos.

2267
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:02,950
Just that tiny... I wish I could, like, zoom in.

2268
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:04,550
Come on, scoot down.

2269
01:39:06,030 --> 01:39:07,190
What is that thing?

2270
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:09,290
It looks kind of like a jellyfish.

2271
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:19,310
I don't see it there.

2272
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:22,930
I know this solar system like the back of my hand.

2273
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:28,110
I've never seen a third thing circulating our planet.

2274
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:29,050
And...

2275
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:32,910
It's not the Quantum Moon either.

2276
01:39:34,270 --> 01:39:36,570
Even though I don't see where the Quantum Moon is here.

2277
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:41,290
Push a zoom button?

2278
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:42,390
There's a zoom button?

2279
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:49,020
Zoom?

2280
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,480
Oh, the signal scope.

2281
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,860
It's so pixely.

2282
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,640
It's just a little...

2283
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,240
It's just a little dot.

2284
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:08,360
It looks like dirt.

2285
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:14,780
Are you sure you know it like the back of your hand?

2286
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:18,720
I think so.

2287
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:21,720
Right?

2288
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,620
Deep space radio.

2289
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:30,460
Is there any other deep space frequencies that I should be aware of?

2290
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,600
Quantum fluctuations.

2291
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,000
Hello quantum moon.

2292
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:51,560
You're listening to deep space radio.

2293
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,020
Does the angle matter?

2294
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,980
I'm going to take another picture of it.

2295
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:17,500
Maybe I must launch into space to find such a mysterious thing around us.

2296
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:27,430
I can whistle pretty well, can't I?

2297
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:30,410
I think I just learned that about myself.

2298
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:39,230
If you ever need another whistler, Jeffrey, I'm your ghost.

2299
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,350
Wait, if I buckle up, I'm going to lose the picture.

2300
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:52,180
I was like, what's that flashing?

2301
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:59,340
You're pretty good.

2302
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,020
Where are you

2303
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:08,470
at?

2304
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:10,710
It's mysterious.

2305
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:13,110
Other...

2306
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:14,310
presents?

2307
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:16,510
What could you be?

2308
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:17,410
Where are you at?

2309
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:18,090
My eyes.

2310
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:18,830
Oh my god.

2311
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:22,510
I like watching the media go backwards.

2312
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,060
It's so funny.

2313
01:42:29,820 --> 01:42:30,980
Sun's looking angry.

2314
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:32,040
No, we still have time.

2315
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:32,260
Sun's looking angry.

2316
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:32,260
No, we still have time.

2317
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:34,320
Sun's looking angry.

2318
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:39,240
No, we still have time.

2319
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:46,460
If I just follow Attle Rock, will I eventually...

2320
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:46,920
If I just follow Attle Rock, will I eventually...

2321
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:51,500
That's what it's called, right?

2322
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:53,360
I'm not just saying names, am I?

2323
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:01,920
What if I go to the observatory?

2324
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:05,200
...

2325
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:05,720
Okay, I'm correct.

2326
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:06,080
Okay.

2327
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:08,700
Oh, finally.

2328
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:12,140
Where did the shade come from?

2329
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:15,700
Wait, I think I just saw the sun station.

2330
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:19,740
It's so crazy that you could see everything from this...

2331
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:20,860
from, like...

2332
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,520
It's so crazy.

2333
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:34,300
It blows my mind that I can, like, travel this universe, this solar system, but also see it almost entirely from my...

2334
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:39,040
from my home planet.

2335
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,640
It's so awesome.

2336
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,140
Like, I can just look up into space and be like, oh!

2337
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,260
There's those planets!

2338
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:50,760
I'm moving at the same velocity as them.

2339
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:51,720
Almost.

2340
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:53,220
What's over here?

2341
01:43:58,010 --> 01:43:59,870
This game is beautifully designed.

2342
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:01,350
Yeah, it really is.

2343
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:03,790
Okay, definitely not that.

2344
01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:05,070
Oh, hi Quantum Moon!

2345
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:07,370
Oh!

2346
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:09,950
I remember this is where one of the Brittles...

2347
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:13,230
fell in.

2348
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,160
That doesn't...

2349
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:20,320
What?

2350
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,400
Where am I supposed to find this thing?

2351
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:24,040
Maybe I do need to go back to my ship.

2352
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:27,100
This way.

2353
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:30,180
Maybe I do need to fly around in my ship.

2354
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:33,920
Bramble, scramble!

2355
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:35,140
Bramble, scramble!

2356
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:38,640
Okay, addle rock.

2357
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:39,600
Okay, addle rock.

2358
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,540
Let's try going to addle rock, I suppose.

2359
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:45,000
And seeing from there.

2360
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:51,920
Oh!

2361
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,640
Oh my gosh, the bramble in the distance.

2362
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,860
It's just so cool, right?

2363
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,960
It's just so awesome.

2364
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:57,740
I could be like, oh, a little bramble.

2365
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:04,910
Alrighty.

2366
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:09,510
This puzzle is already scratching my brain.

2367
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:11,170
Psst!

2368
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:13,170
Okay.

2369
01:45:13,710 --> 01:45:15,150
Buckle up, buttercup.

2370
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:26,020
What the?

2371
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:28,120
Has there always been a teleporter here?

2372
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,260
Is it usable?

2373
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:34,660
There has?

2374
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:35,180
Oh!

2375
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:37,360
Blind.

2376
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,940
I remember going inside there.

2377
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:43,020
Okay.

2378
01:45:43,620 --> 01:45:44,460
Addle rock.

2379
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:48,020
Have you checked your ship's logs?

2380
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:49,920
No.

2381
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,600
Should I?

2382
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:51,540
Ouch.

2383
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:52,400
Not bad.

2384
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,240
We're fine.

2385
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:56,380
Why did I get hurt?

2386
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,480
Let's see.

2387
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:02,260
Quantum moon.

2388
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,740
Quantum shrine.

2389
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:05,240
Sixth location.

2390
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:06,820
Old settlement.

2391
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:08,220
The vessel.

2392
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:09,780
Mural.

2393
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:11,220
Mural.

2394
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:12,620
Mural.

2395
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,320
Escape pod.

2396
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:16,100
Escape pod.

2397
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:19,740
Radio tower.

2398
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:24,110
Hmm.

2399
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:25,530
Hmm.

2400
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:26,050
Hmm.

2401
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:38,520
What am I eating?

2402
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:39,300
A taco bowl.

2403
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:39,980
Hahaha.

2404
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:41,240
It's my dinner.

2405
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:45,560
Remember to wear your seatbelt, Chad, or that could be you.

2406
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:46,000
Hahaha.

2407
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:47,920
Hmm.

2408
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:52,700
A radio tower designed to receive photos taken by the deep space satellite.

2409
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:56,340
There are several photos of the entire solar system hanging on the walls.

2410
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,500
Horned fowls noticed something strange in one of the photos.

2411
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:02,220
But concluding the equipment malfunction was the only sensible explanation.

2412
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:04,440
I wonder if I go talk to him.

2413
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,220
If I'm like, hey, mister.

2414
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:08,740
Horned fowls.

2415
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:14,920
Alright.

2416
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,700
We're looking for addle rock.

2417
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:21,780
Or horned fowls.

2418
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:22,880
Whichever we find sooner.

2419
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:25,720
He's at the observatory, correct?

2420
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:31,010
Oh my gosh, I had like a little...

2421
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:33,910
I have like a spot I just noticed on my monitor that I need to clean.

2422
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:36,610
And I was like, is that it?

2423
01:47:37,010 --> 01:47:37,430
Hahaha.

2424
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:39,130
What the?

2425
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:48,500
What is this?

2426
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,900
Oh, excuse me!

2427
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:53,520
Excuse me!

2428
01:47:59,930 --> 01:48:01,170
Oh, it's going inside.

2429
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:04,110
It's not going inside.

2430
01:48:04,510 --> 01:48:05,030
It's...

2431
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:07,310
Oh my god.

2432
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:08,250
Oh, I'm coming in!

2433
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:10,130
Did it just go inside here?

2434
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:12,130
Wait, where did it go?

2435
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:14,070
I lost... oh, there it is.

2436
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,630
What is this thing?

2437
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:22,490
That was so close, wasn't it?

2438
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:23,130
Hahaha.

2439
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:24,950
What is this thing?

2440
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:30,990
I can't... I can't...

2441
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:33,150
It won't let me like, lock on it.

2442
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:37,110
It's the planet's satellite.

2443
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:38,890
Oh.

2444
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:40,110
It's been here the whole time?

2445
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:44,830
It's for the probe of the Nomai.

2446
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:45,690
Hahaha.

2447
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:48,470
I was like, I found it!

2448
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:49,270
Hahaha.

2449
01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:54,030
I was so excited, you guys, man.

2450
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:58,990
From the probe tutorial.

2451
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:00,730
Dang.

2452
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:02,710
Okay.

2453
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:04,550
Where is Adel... I think we...

2454
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:09,810
I saw Adelrock and I ignored it, because I was just like, not...

2455
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:12,370
You're not my little tiny satellite?

2456
01:49:12,370 --> 01:49:15,010
Okay, this is where the brambles.

2457
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:16,850
Adelrock.

2458
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:17,690
Adelrock.

2459
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:21,480
Oh.

2460
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:22,220
Wait.

2461
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:27,380
Pashamin!

2462
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,320
Hello!

2463
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:41,740
Good landing.

2464
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,580
And Dark Skies, welcome to membership.

2465
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:45,380
Thank you!

2466
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:54,790
Unidentified...

2467
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:55,010
Wow!

2468
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:56,930
I'm about to...

2469
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:00,430
Set myself on fire, man.

2470
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:08,500
Quantum moon!

2471
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:08,900
Quantum moon!

2472
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:09,100
Uh -oh.

2473
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,000
The sun is looking...

2474
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:13,080
It's pretty spicy.

2475
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:13,780
Hello!

2476
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:20,050
Press expert.

2477
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:21,470
Hahaha.

2478
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:25,610
Hey, this ain't my first rodeo, man.

2479
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:27,210
I don't need no...

2480
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:30,150
I don't need no landing mode.

2481
01:50:30,590 --> 01:50:30,970
Hahaha.

2482
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:34,010
Okay, where is...

2483
01:50:34,010 --> 01:50:34,350
Oh, here we go.

2484
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:37,930
I see...

2485
01:50:40,130 --> 01:50:40,990
That's not it.

2486
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:43,270
That looks like another thing that exploded in space.

2487
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:49,790
Maybe I should talk to him anyway.

2488
01:50:53,870 --> 01:50:54,750
Hey, it's you!

2489
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:56,870
Ground control didn't tell me you were launching.

2490
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:57,890
Long time no see.

2491
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:01,030
Actually, I guess it's been a long time since I've seen anyone.

2492
01:51:02,350 --> 01:51:03,630
What is that you're whistling?

2493
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:06,010
I thought it was like, whistling.

2494
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:11,290
Probably.

2495
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:12,590
Or actually, definitely.

2496
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:13,990
The other travelers carry instruments.

2497
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:15,570
So they don't bother whistling.

2498
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:17,590
You can pick up their music with the signal scope.

2499
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:18,390
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

2500
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:20,570
Okay.

2501
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:36,760
It's some...

2502
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,180
I wish I still had the photo.

2503
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,440
I wish I still had the photo.

2504
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:44,820
To get the angle.

2505
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:48,640
It's time.

2506
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:50,160
For the meatball.

2507
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:01,980
Wow.

2508
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,200
It's like a mouth.

2509
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:05,780
I...

2510
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:09,440
I'm gonna go look at the photo again.

2511
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,500
07s in the chat, everybody.

2512
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:16,700
07s.

2513
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:22,840
Or I can just be in orbit.

2514
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:24,780
While we die.

2515
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:27,840
Oh, there's...

2516
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,000
There's an observatory.

2517
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:32,040
We'll just stay in orbit, I guess.

2518
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:32,500
While we die.

2519
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,920
You could just meditate through this.

2520
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:36,520
I guess you're right.

2521
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:39,680
It's kind of awesome.

2522
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:40,960
Being in orbit, though.

2523
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:41,440
I'm a...

2524
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,660
I'm a moon now.

2525
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:46,780
I'm a moon!

2526
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,760
This music is always a combination of sad plus jumbled.

2527
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,940
You can kind of hear it in the beginning, though.

2528
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:57,700
It's not quite...

2529
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:59,380
It's a little less of a jump scare.

2530
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:01,960
There we go.

2531
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:38,640
Gosh, could you take any longer to explode?

2532
01:53:40,140 --> 01:53:41,100
Come on, son.

2533
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:43,940
Okay.

2534
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:50,430
Let's go take another look at the picture.

2535
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:53,330
And see if I can notice any...

2536
01:53:59,460 --> 01:54:01,780
Any defining features...

2537
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:07,280
Of the picture.

2538
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,040
That will help me find it.

2539
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:10,540
Hmm.

2540
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:12,360
Okay.

2541
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,380
How's my little ghost matter doing?

2542
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:22,140
Don't call me that!

2543
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:24,300
It seems gross.

2544
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:27,500
I don't like it.

2545
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,340
Don't call me that!

2546
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:33,160
Okay.

2547
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:38,790
I am on the right track, though, right?

2548
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:41,510
Like, that's the thing that...

2549
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:41,970
Oh.

2550
01:54:43,290 --> 01:54:45,010
That's the thing that I'm looking for.

2551
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:45,530
Right?

2552
01:54:50,710 --> 01:54:51,530
You're cooking.

2553
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:52,050
Okay.

2554
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:55,890
I'm gonna cover myself...

2555
01:54:55,890 --> 01:54:56,810
With ghost matter.

2556
01:54:59,550 --> 01:55:00,430
Takodachi, you okay?

2557
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:11,730
What, do I have to go all the way to, like, the black hole station?

2558
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:13,490
It shouldn't have to be like that, right?

2559
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:19,470
Deep space signal.

2560
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:19,970
Okay.

2561
01:55:26,450 --> 01:55:27,610
Deep space radio.

2562
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:28,290
Oh!

2563
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:28,950
Wait a second.

2564
01:55:55,970 --> 01:55:57,210
It didn't show up before.

2565
01:55:59,650 --> 01:56:00,650
So I was like...

2566
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:02,190
It doesn't exist.

2567
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:07,620
Oh.

2568
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:10,320
Wait, it disappeared.

2569
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:11,140
Oh, no.

2570
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:11,700
It's still there.

2571
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,400
Autopilot!

2572
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:19,820
Here we go!

2573
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:29,820
I think I remember seeing this red dot before.

2574
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,680
And questioning it.

2575
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,000
Before in the actual game.

2576
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:40,960
It's kind of far.

2577
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:43,640
It's actually quite far.

2578
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:55,310
How am I so close?

2579
01:56:56,030 --> 01:56:57,250
But it looks so far away.

2580
01:56:59,490 --> 01:56:59,890
Oh?

2581
01:57:07,690 --> 01:57:08,410
Oh, there it is.

2582
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,390
Oh!

2583
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:11,090
Coming in hot!

2584
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:11,670
Coming in hot!

2585
01:57:13,310 --> 01:57:14,570
What the heck is this?

2586
01:57:19,060 --> 01:57:20,100
Oh, it's a satellite.

2587
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:28,060
Um...

2588
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:29,740
Error.

2589
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:30,200
Offline.

2590
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,480
Is that what it said?

2591
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:33,200
And there's a radio.

2592
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:34,260
Okay, we gotta get out.

2593
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:36,480
Okay.

2594
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:37,540
I gotta get in there.

2595
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:41,260
Where is it?

2596
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:41,920
There!

2597
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:42,820
Oh shoot.

2598
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:43,340
Oh!

2599
01:57:45,020 --> 01:57:45,480
Hold!

2600
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:46,080
Hold!

2601
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:46,780
Hold!

2602
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:47,460
Wait!

2603
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:47,940
There

2604
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:11,180
we go.

2605
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:12,180
Wait.

2606
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:12,960
Wait.

2607
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:13,420
Wait.

2608
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:16,320
Gabbro here.

2609
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,540
Checking in on the Deep Space Satellite.

2610
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:21,320
Per Ground Control's request to check out a possible equipment problem.

2611
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:22,480
See, Hornfels?

2612
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:23,840
I do to work.

2613
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:27,680
You know, I wouldn't mind being a satellite.

2614
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:28,340
See?

2615
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:29,360
He gets it!

2616
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:30,680
That's what we were doing.

2617
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,120
It's peaceful out here.

2618
01:58:32,260 --> 01:58:35,180
Among the distant stars and the soft, velvety darkness.

2619
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:36,640
But it's...

2620
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:41,060
Gosh, I actually really are...

2621
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:43,040
awfully nice for naps too.

2622
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:46,300
Alright, the lens.

2623
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:48,000
Alright, little satellite.

2624
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:50,240
Let's see what the trouble is.

2625
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:51,860
Huh.

2626
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:53,220
Everything looks A-OK.

2627
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:58,200
Ground Control, no dust or scratches on the lens, and no evidence of sparking or violent explosions.

2628
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:01,120
Guess that rules out an equipment malfunction after all.

2629
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:06,700
When you drive, you also hit the gas before you know which direction you're supposed to be pointed.

2630
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:16,700
Sometimes I do just go.

2631
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:20,740
Sometimes I do just go.

2632
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:25,020
Sometimes I do just go.

2633
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:26,680
Also, shut the hell up, Murphy.

2634
01:59:26,900 --> 01:59:28,900
I kicked your ass once, I'll do it again.

2635
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:30,680
Hear that, pal?

2636
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:31,640
You're in great shape.

2637
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:32,900
Keep up the good work out here.

2638
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:50,010
My ship is so far.

2639
01:59:51,690 --> 01:59:52,130
OK.

2640
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:13,590
Nice and easy.

2641
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:15,230
OK.

2642
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:16,130
Nice and easy.

2643
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:16,810
OK.

2644
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:18,050
Nice and easy.

2645
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:20,030
Easy peasy.

2646
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:21,290
Error.

2647
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:22,410
Map offline.

2648
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:23,930
OK.

2649
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:25,790
And...

2650
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:26,870
What does that mean?

2651
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:29,730
Outer Wild Adventures.

2652
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:31,710
Uh-huh.

2653
02:00:32,170 --> 02:00:33,090
Um...

2654
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:36,320
You bonked it?

2655
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:36,780
Bonk.

2656
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:39,000
...

2657
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:46,660
...

2658
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:47,120
...

2659
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:48,080
...

2660
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:48,100
...

2661
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:52,660
... Where's our planet?

2662
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:53,440
Oh.

2663
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:56,580
Timber.

2664
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:01,390
My ship.

2665
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:03,110
Where'd it go?

2666
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:04,870
Oh my god.

2667
02:01:05,190 --> 02:01:06,810
Can't ever find the same thing.

2668
02:01:07,910 --> 02:01:09,610
Is there anything else I need to...

2669
02:01:10,410 --> 02:01:11,010
Hmm.

2670
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:18,390
Uh...

2671
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:18,730
Bonk!

2672
02:01:22,450 --> 02:01:23,050
Um...

2673
02:01:23,670 --> 02:01:24,530
Let's go back to my ship.

2674
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:36,250
OK.

2675
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:38,090
Uh...

2676
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:41,010
...

2677
02:01:41,010 --> 02:01:43,050
The silence with only your breath against the helmet...

2678
02:01:43,050 --> 02:01:43,290
I know!

2679
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:45,270
It makes me want to be so quiet, right?

2680
02:01:45,690 --> 02:01:46,310
Makes me...

2681
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:48,490
It makes me not want to... I'm like...

2682
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:50,230
You know?

2683
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,630
Oh, please.

2684
02:01:53,790 --> 02:01:54,030
Please.

2685
02:01:54,650 --> 02:01:56,970
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

2686
02:01:57,190 --> 02:01:57,310
...

2687
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:10,360
Well, what did that teach me?

2688
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:12,000
...

2689
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:13,900
...

2690
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:14,240
...

2691
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:18,580
That didn't teach me so much, though.

2692
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:19,060
...

2693
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,520
We didn't even get, like, a little entry about the satellite.

2694
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:25,160
...

2695
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:26,180
Hmm.

2696
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:27,480
Not to bonk satellites.

2697
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:28,260
What?

2698
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:30,760
What's wrong with bonking the satellite?

2699
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,240
...

2700
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:53,720
Oh?

2701
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:54,600
...

2702
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:56,140
Uh-oh.

2703
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,400
Did I break it?

2704
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:01,660
...

2705
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:06,600
But it was already broken!

2706
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:08,460
...

2707
02:03:11,810 --> 02:03:13,850
But it was already broken!

2708
02:03:14,070 --> 02:03:14,470
...

2709
02:03:15,310 --> 02:03:16,370
Uh, maybe I should go home.

2710
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:19,750
...

2711
02:03:21,370 --> 02:03:22,210
Where is home?

2712
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:23,730
...

2713
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:26,710
Oh, now I actually don't know.

2714
02:03:26,770 --> 02:03:28,170
I was gonna... Okay, there we go.

2715
02:03:28,810 --> 02:03:31,050
I was like...

2716
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:37,600
Only because you bonked it.

2717
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:38,680
Wait, really?

2718
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:39,800
Uh-oh.

2719
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:40,300
...

2720
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:42,880
Gabbro said it was fine.

2721
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:45,940
No, when I came up on it, it said it was map offline!

2722
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:47,280
...

2723
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,260
When I came up on it!

2724
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:51,720
Before I even touched it!

2725
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:52,360
...

2726
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:53,760
I promise!

2727
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:54,960
I promise!

2728
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:55,660
I saw it!

2729
02:03:55,740 --> 02:03:56,260
I saw it!

2730
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:57,460
...

2731
02:03:57,460 --> 02:03:58,140
...

2732
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:16,900
Am I the body?

2733
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:18,500
...

2734
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,400
...

2735
02:04:27,910 --> 02:04:28,470
Oopsie.

2736
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:29,610
...

2737
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:32,450
Oopsie.

2738
02:04:33,570 --> 02:04:34,130
...

2739
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:36,030
Um...

2740
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:36,950
...

2741
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:46,300
Oh no.

2742
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:46,680
Wait.

2743
02:04:47,460 --> 02:04:48,980
If I go to...

2744
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:51,460
If I go to him, can I be like...

2745
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:53,000
I'm really sorry I broke the thing.

2746
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:55,160
Will he be mad at me?

2747
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:56,180
...

2748
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:58,500
Will he be mad at me?

2749
02:04:58,600 --> 02:04:59,620
I broke the map.

2750
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:00,460
I broke the map!

2751
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:01,720
...

2752
02:05:08,710 --> 02:05:09,970
He will kill you.

2753
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:10,690
...

2754
02:05:10,690 --> 02:05:12,590
Alex, welcome to membership.

2755
02:05:12,730 --> 02:05:13,390
Thank you!

2756
02:05:15,190 --> 02:05:15,270
...

2757
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,630
...

2758
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:22,660
Hello, Quantum Stone.

2759
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:25,140
I did it.

2760
02:05:25,860 --> 02:05:27,340
I broke the map.

2761
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:28,920
...

2762
02:05:32,930 --> 02:05:34,250
He doesn't care!

2763
02:05:35,130 --> 02:05:35,510
...

2764
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:37,550
Okay.

2765
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:38,990
...

2766
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:49,910
Let's go...

2767
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:50,450
...

2768
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:52,310
Let's go back to...

2769
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:52,870
...

2770
02:05:57,730 --> 02:05:59,330
Let's go back to...

2771
02:06:00,230 --> 02:06:01,610
This is the...

2772
02:06:01,610 --> 02:06:04,030
This is the satellite we just went to.

2773
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:04,850
And broke.

2774
02:06:05,710 --> 02:06:05,750
...

2775
02:06:07,390 --> 02:06:08,250
I guess.

2776
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:10,070
Allegedly.

2777
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:13,350
There's no evidence of me breaking it.

2778
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:15,070
...

2779
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:21,340
Okay.

2780
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:22,180
...

2781
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:30,820
These balls move on their own!

2782
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:31,520
...

2783
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:36,900
I need to get back up to my ship.

2784
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:40,420
...

2785
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:47,180
Perfect.

2786
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:48,680
...

2787
02:06:56,120 --> 02:06:57,220
I think I'm...

2788
02:06:58,380 --> 02:06:59,680
I think I'm stuck.

2789
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:00,540
Let's see.

2790
02:07:00,660 --> 02:07:01,020
Hold on.

2791
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:02,320
Is it... Ow.

2792
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:03,500
Maybe under the map view.

2793
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:04,980
...

2794
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:08,260
What's this?

2795
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:09,100
Oh, Quantum Moon.

2796
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:10,400
...

2797
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:12,760
What's this?

2798
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,740
Ash Twin.

2799
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:14,720
...

2800
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:16,080
...

2801
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:18,660
I'm starting to realize why she has DVR turned off.

2802
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:26,860
...

2803
02:07:26,860 --> 02:07:27,320
...

2804
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:28,740
...

2805
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:31,300
...

2806
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:31,440
...

2807
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:31,460
...

2808
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:31,900
...

2809
02:07:46,350 --> 02:07:48,090
Let's go back to the...

2810
02:07:48,090 --> 02:07:48,570
...

2811
02:07:49,970 --> 02:07:50,530
...

2812
02:07:50,530 --> 02:07:51,570
To the radio tower.

2813
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:52,210
...

2814
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:52,390
...

2815
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:54,770
...

2816
02:07:54,770 --> 02:07:55,270
...

2817
02:08:09,570 --> 02:08:10,690
Just solve it.

2818
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:11,290
...

2819
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:14,350
Just solve it, forehead.

2820
02:08:15,130 --> 02:08:15,690
...

2821
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:25,330
I didn't see it either...

2822
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:25,750
Oh my gosh.

2823
02:08:25,850 --> 02:08:26,750
Scared me again.

2824
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:29,050
I didn't see it either when I went out there.

2825
02:08:29,850 --> 02:08:30,410
...

2826
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:39,380
Do I have to wait for these planets to be in this alignment?

2827
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:41,360
...

2828
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,420
That's so much though.

2829
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:43,180
...

2830
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:45,120
Did she find the DLC yet, chat?

2831
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:45,320
...

2832
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:00,200
Go back to the second photo and count the planets.

2833
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:02,040
Wait, what's the second photo?

2834
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:03,040
...

2835
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:04,780
This one?

2836
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:05,580
...

2837
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:06,060
...

2838
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:06,640
...

2839
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:06,920
...

2840
02:09:06,920 --> 02:09:07,200
...

2841
02:09:18,460 --> 02:09:19,860
Oh,

2842
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:24,480
advance.

2843
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:26,860
...

2844
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:27,900
...

2845
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:30,860
...

2846
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:31,000
5, 6.

2847
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:37,010
1...

2848
02:09:37,790 --> 02:09:38,490
2...

2849
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:40,120
3...

2850
02:09:40,470 --> 02:09:41,750
Oh my god, this scared me.

2851
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:43,370
4...

2852
02:09:43,740 --> 02:09:44,350
5, 6.

2853
02:09:54,190 --> 02:09:54,700
Am I...

2854
02:09:55,250 --> 02:09:55,880
missing something?

2855
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:57,820
1...

2856
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:00,500
2...

2857
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:01,260
3...

2858
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:01,780
4...

2859
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:02,340
5, 6...

2860
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:02,780
7!

2861
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:14,160
It's you!

2862
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:25,200
Well, I thought this was strange, but I thought it was... actually...

2863
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:27,800
Timber Hearth is right there.

2864
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:31,120
I'm the dummy.

2865
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:35,520
I noticed it this whole time, but I thought it was Timber Hearth that's eclipsing the sun.

2866
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:36,960
Oh.

2867
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:39,660
Whoopsie.

2868
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:42,840
Because it... oh, it's in this picture that it's eclipsing the sun.

2869
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:45,120
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2870
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:47,920
Oh, wait, but...

2871
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:48,220
Uh?

2872
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,020
It's a coffee stain.

2873
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:52,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2874
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:56,870
So then...

2875
02:11:03,160 --> 02:11:04,400
Satellite angle 40.

2876
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:11,150
Common Outer Wilds occurrence.

2877
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:13,190
You should see playtest with no chat.

2878
02:11:13,410 --> 02:11:14,810
I can't even imagine.

2879
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:17,130
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2880
02:11:17,170 --> 02:11:18,690
I can't even imagine.

2881
02:11:22,210 --> 02:11:23,510
Satellite angle 40.

2882
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:23,710
Satellite angle 40.

2883
02:11:30,850 --> 02:11:31,290
Gabbro.

2884
02:11:34,410 --> 02:11:34,850
Hmm...

2885
02:11:40,260 --> 02:11:41,840
Do I have to go back to the satellite?

2886
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:43,980
Or is it now, anyway?

2887
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:46,420
Where are you?

2888
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:50,960
Where are you, other satellite?

2889
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:54,160
Okay, so it's not even picking up anymore.

2890
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:55,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2891
02:11:57,060 --> 02:11:57,500
Um...

2892
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:59,300
It's not even picking up anymore.

2893
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:01,820
See, this is why I couldn't find it in the first place.

2894
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:03,920
Hmm...

2895
02:12:06,700 --> 02:12:07,460
What is here?

2896
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:15,940
Despite my checking on them a thousand times over, the images are still not ready to print over in the radio tower.

2897
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:16,260
Oh.

2898
02:12:17,540 --> 02:12:18,300
Now they are.

2899
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:21,300
Gabbro's three foolproof steps for dozing off.

2900
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:26,820
Oh, I dozed off.

2901
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:27,300
My bad.

2902
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,920
I pressed the wrong button.

2903
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:29,880
There we go.

2904
02:12:33,790 --> 02:12:34,190
Ha.

2905
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:35,470
Ha.

2906
02:12:36,750 --> 02:12:37,190
Ah!

2907
02:12:47,780 --> 02:12:49,680
You can find the satellite using the map.

2908
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:50,820
The one, the map that I broke?

2909
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:54,620
You mean the map that I broke?

2910
02:12:58,860 --> 02:13:00,160
Okay, I'm gonna meditate.

2911
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:03,660
Oop.

2912
02:13:04,900 --> 02:13:06,240
Let's just meditate, I guess.

2913
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,100
Goodbye, everybody.

2914
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:12,040
Goodbye, everybody.

2915
02:13:13,180 --> 02:13:14,040
Looping again.

2916
02:13:24,250 --> 02:13:24,730
Hmm...

2917
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:36,750
Sorry, watching it spin like that was so sweet.

2918
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:39,230
Okay.

2919
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:44,020
Okey-dokey.

2920
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:48,100
The launch couch.

2921
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:51,100
I hope she breaks it again.

2922
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:51,700
Stop it!

2923
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:53,180
Whoa, what the heck was that?

2924
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:56,820
Gosh, there's some aliens on this planet.

2925
02:13:57,180 --> 02:13:58,120
Or in this...

2926
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:07,420
This one.

2927
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:18,660
Hmm...

2928
02:14:20,700 --> 02:14:21,860
That's the interloper.

2929
02:14:25,420 --> 02:14:26,540
Don't bonk it this time.

2930
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:27,620
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2931
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:29,580
Gonna do my best.

2932
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:34,460
No promises.

2933
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:37,460
Where is it anyway?

2934
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:46,130
Okay.

2935
02:14:48,570 --> 02:14:49,910
I'm not gonna bonk it.

2936
02:14:51,670 --> 02:14:52,590
I'm not...

2937
02:14:54,210 --> 02:14:55,630
I'm not gonna bonk it.

2938
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:03,440
Why is it...

2939
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:03,820
It's...

2940
02:15:04,460 --> 02:15:07,580
It's actually the satellite's fault for being such a sensitive baby.

2941
02:15:10,120 --> 02:15:10,640
Okay.

2942
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:12,620
Watch her bonk it.

2943
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:13,600
I'm not gonna bonk it.

2944
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:16,160
I'm not gonna bonk it.

2945
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:26,020
I'm not even gonna get close to it.

2946
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:27,140
Okay, that's a little close.

2947
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:27,480
Okay.

2948
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:31,120
It's in its orbit.

2949
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:32,840
It's totally doing its thing.

2950
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:35,320
I'm going behind it.

2951
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:40,140
To see what it sees.

2952
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:43,000
Okay.

2953
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:48,140
Okay.

2954
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:48,360
Okay.

2955
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:54,640
It's just like a sensitive baby is all, you know?

2956
02:15:54,880 --> 02:16:01,300
It's a good thing that I moved.

2957
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:25,260
I'm getting out.

2958
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:34,280
Satellite!

2959
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:36,860
I come in peace!

2960
02:16:37,540 --> 02:16:40,480
I come with no ill intentions.

2961
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:46,280
Yup, I think you got something that I might need.

2962
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:47,860
Angle 40.

2963
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:51,480
On one side.

2964
02:16:52,340 --> 02:16:53,920
Oh, it's red.

2965
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:55,120
No, wait.

2966
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:57,940
This display panel right there.

2967
02:16:58,860 --> 02:17:00,940
Yes, I'm not gonna touch it.

2968
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:02,420
I'm not gonna touch it.

2969
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:04,820
How do I get close to it though?

2970
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:27,750
Wait, it went to 47 now.

2971
02:17:32,290 --> 02:17:35,230
Wait, it was 40... Oh no, did I miss my chance?

2972
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:37,570
It keeps going up now.

2973
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:44,200
Is that it right there?

2974
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:55,930
It was at 40 though.

2975
02:18:00,390 --> 02:18:01,190
Wandering Taco!

2976
02:18:01,490 --> 02:18:02,490
Thank you for the 50!

2977
02:18:05,770 --> 02:18:06,870
Thank you for the 50!

2978
02:18:06,970 --> 02:18:07,130
Thank you for the 50!

2979
02:18:07,310 --> 02:18:08,150
Thank you so much!

2980
02:18:08,590 --> 02:18:10,490
Do I have to go back to...

2981
02:18:19,410 --> 02:18:20,750
Will it ever go back?

2982
02:18:20,930 --> 02:18:21,930
It's only going up.

2983
02:18:22,110 --> 02:18:22,510
Oh no!

2984
02:18:24,290 --> 02:18:24,670
Hmm...

2985
02:18:28,560 --> 02:18:30,980
I probably have to see it though from my ship, right?

2986
02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:32,340
Well, I guess not.

2987
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:35,700
Time to meditate.

2988
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:41,700
Okay, we'll come back.

2989
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:45,680
Okay, I got it though.

2990
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:46,180
I got it.

2991
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:47,440
I got what I gotta do.

2992
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:49,720
Okay.

2993
02:18:52,980 --> 02:18:56,560
Okay, I understand why the meditating is useful to have here.

2994
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:04,180
Should've bonked it on your way out.

2995
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:04,820
You're so right.

2996
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:07,300
You're so right.

2997
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:11,220
Okay.

2998
02:19:21,860 --> 02:19:24,220
But, I might have to take a picture of it, probably.

2999
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:25,360
It seems to be quantum.

3000
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:27,960
So...

3001
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:29,200
Okay, buckle up.

3002
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:45,620
Here.

3003
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:53,720
This is autopilot.

3004
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:54,800
Here we go.

3005
02:19:57,720 --> 02:19:58,240
Okay.

3006
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:58,500
Okay.

3007
02:19:59,140 --> 02:19:59,620
Alrighty!

3008
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:01,280
We got this, baby!

3009
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:07,900
Just has to be at a forty-ish angle.

3010
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:10,580
Ish.

3011
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:23,660
I thought it might say something on the display panel, which is why I was like, oh, I should, you know.

3012
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:26,200
I should read it.

3013
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:28,460
But all it said was the degree.

3014
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,660
So maybe now if I look at the sign...

3015
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:52,050
Where is the display?

3016
02:20:52,230 --> 02:20:52,490
Oh, here.

3017
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:01,160
Seventeen?

3018
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:04,240
Eighteen?

3019
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:04,340
Nineteen?

3020
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:07,780
Okay, nineteen?

3021
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:11,380
Twenty?

3022
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:16,720
Plenty of time.

3023
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:18,860
Twenty-two?

3024
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:22,840
Twenty-three?

3025
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:26,460
Wow, it just feels like we're not moving at all.

3026
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:28,400
We're just in...

3027
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:30,720
Twenty-five.

3028
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:32,880
I'm gonna eat my...

3029
02:21:34,240 --> 02:21:34,440
dinner.

3030
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,540
A little bit.

3031
02:21:51,890 --> 02:21:52,690
Not yet.

3032
02:22:01,630 --> 02:22:02,430
Not yet.

3033
02:22:31,580 --> 02:22:31,980
Wait.

3034
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:34,200
Wait.

3035
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:38,560
Let's just go!

3036
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:43,100
I don't want to match the velocity of the sun, though.

3037
02:22:45,140 --> 02:22:46,040
Oh, hold it down.

3038
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:46,520
There we go.

3039
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:49,840
I keep watching it.

3040
02:22:53,460 --> 02:22:54,820
I wish I would...

3041
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:56,680
I could focus on this thing, though.

3042
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:58,340
Go, go, go.

3043
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:04,490
Here we go!

3044
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:27,190
What's here?

3045
02:23:35,390 --> 02:23:36,030
Oh, this?

3046
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:43,780
Can I get in here?

3047
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:45,640
I think this is a...

3048
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:47,780
A way in?

3049
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:48,880
Kind of?

3050
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:54,960
Nice landing!

3051
02:23:55,340 --> 02:23:56,420
Oh, just kidding.

3052
02:23:57,700 --> 02:23:58,160
Unbuckle.

3053
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:00,940
Everything is good.

3054
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:02,780
I think.

3055
02:24:05,980 --> 02:24:06,440
Wow.

3056
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:10,140
We're inside!

3057
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:14,380
What is this place?

3058
02:24:14,540 --> 02:24:14,820
Wow!

3059
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:19,220
New aliens!

3060
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:25,500
So cool!

3061
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:31,320
I want to go up here, but maybe it's nothing.

3062
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:32,340
Let's go inside.

3063
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:34,040
Okay.

3064
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:36,080
Have a great streaming, though!

3065
02:24:36,160 --> 02:24:36,580
Thank you!

3066
02:24:38,140 --> 02:24:38,920
What is this?

3067
02:24:39,860 --> 02:24:40,380
Unbuckle?

3068
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:46,060
What if these guys aren't friendly?

3069
02:24:46,060 --> 02:24:46,160
Finally.

3070
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:49,900
I just invaded their ship.

3071
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:54,620
Unknown language.

3072
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:11,340
Unknown language.

3073
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:17,980
Okay, interesting.

3074
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:21,740
It turns my flashlight off.

3075
02:25:25,490 --> 02:25:26,550
What's this?

3076
02:25:27,050 --> 02:25:27,930
Rotate.

3077
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:36,040
I'm on a ship.

3078
02:25:39,900 --> 02:25:41,560
Oh, and this is how I drive it.

3079
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:42,120
Oh my gosh.

3080
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:44,720
Uh oh.

3081
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:45,460
What's happening?

3082
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:51,840
This is how I drive it.

3083
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:54,540
Oh my gosh.

3084
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:55,800
It's Halo.

3085
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:58,200
We're okay.

3086
02:26:00,940 --> 02:26:01,380
Nice.

3087
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:03,140
That's exactly what I did.

3088
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:03,960
I knew what was going to happen.

3089
02:26:07,020 --> 02:26:11,200
Is this an existing, alive species at the moment?

3090
02:26:13,880 --> 02:26:15,520
Official welcome to the DLC.

3091
02:26:15,580 --> 02:26:16,220
Enjoy the journey.

3092
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:17,160
Thank you, Jeffrey!

3093
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:20,320
Oh my god!

3094
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:23,540
It looks like a church almost.

3095
02:26:26,740 --> 02:26:28,300
Ship log updated.

3096
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:30,240
Yeah, I would think so.

3097
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:35,740
Oh, it doesn't look so alive, after all.

3098
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:36,680
Wow, they're huge.

3099
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:37,460
We're teeny tiny.

3100
02:26:39,380 --> 02:26:40,900
They were playing Jenga.

3101
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:43,840
Someone who has watched before.

3102
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:48,520
Watched it before you even had 500 subs, let alone 100 viewers.

3103
02:26:48,620 --> 02:26:50,040
I'm so happy that you had a successful comeback.

3104
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:50,720
Thank you so much.

3105
02:26:50,900 --> 02:26:52,260
Oh my gosh, thank you!

3106
02:26:53,460 --> 02:26:55,620
Thanks for sticking around for so long.

3107
02:26:58,500 --> 02:26:58,900
Creepy.

3108
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:01,040
Okay.

3109
02:27:03,820 --> 02:27:05,380
It's like, um, oh my gosh.

3110
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:07,320
The things in, um...

3111
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:11,980
It's like the, the guy, the deer guy in, uh...

3112
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:15,180
Oh my gosh, why can't I think of that, the, um...

3113
02:27:15,180 --> 02:27:17,780
That show that I watch every Halloween.

3114
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:23,420
Uh-oh, the sun is looking a little spicy, though.

3115
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:26,100
Drop lantern.

3116
02:27:26,100 --> 02:27:26,340
Can't turn.

3117
02:27:31,230 --> 02:27:32,110
Oh, uh...

3118
02:27:35,460 --> 02:27:35,900
Cool.

3119
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:39,160
Over the garden wall!

3120
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:39,960
Yes, thank you.

3121
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:41,060
Thank you, thank you.

3122
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:42,080
Use interface.

3123
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:45,460
Oh, wait.

3124
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:52,100
Okay, nothing we can do here yet.

3125
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:54,520
Oh, unless I have my flashlight on while I use it?

3126
02:27:54,600 --> 02:27:54,780
Oh no.

3127
02:27:56,260 --> 02:27:56,940
Turned it off.

3128
02:27:59,240 --> 02:28:00,040
The council.

3129
02:28:08,290 --> 02:28:08,630
Whoa!

3130
02:28:09,150 --> 02:28:10,470
They're so cool.

3131
02:28:10,970 --> 02:28:12,410
Yeah, it's like, uh...

3132
02:28:13,610 --> 02:28:15,410
It's like the over the garden wall guy.

3133
02:28:22,090 --> 02:28:23,430
They really are huge.

3134
02:28:23,750 --> 02:28:26,670
I'm a teeny tiny little alien.

3135
02:28:27,430 --> 02:28:29,130
These are giant aliens.

3136
02:28:30,270 --> 02:28:31,850
If I could go the reverse way.

3137
02:28:34,890 --> 02:28:35,410
Nah.

3138
02:28:37,710 --> 02:28:39,310
Can we watch it together this fall?

3139
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:39,870
Maybe, yeah.

3140
02:28:40,730 --> 02:28:41,450
Why not?

3141
02:28:41,450 --> 02:28:42,530
I watch it every year.

3142
02:28:44,090 --> 02:28:44,610
Wow!

3143
02:28:44,990 --> 02:28:46,890
This place is so cool!

3144
02:28:48,090 --> 02:28:48,770
What's this?

3145
02:28:49,210 --> 02:28:50,510
Already holding lantern.

3146
02:28:52,010 --> 02:28:52,530
Remove...

3147
02:28:52,530 --> 02:28:52,610
Oh!

3148
02:28:55,170 --> 02:28:57,210
Sounds like this is the thing we need.

3149
02:29:00,430 --> 02:29:00,950
Oh.

3150
02:29:01,290 --> 02:29:03,030
I have to find a way to...

3151
02:29:03,030 --> 02:29:03,470
Oh, drop!

3152
02:29:04,070 --> 02:29:04,590
Drop.

3153
02:29:04,810 --> 02:29:05,710
I saw it.

3154
02:29:05,790 --> 02:29:06,070
I...

3155
02:29:06,070 --> 02:29:06,530
Drop...

3156
02:29:06,530 --> 02:29:06,610
Oh.

3157
02:29:09,410 --> 02:29:10,370
Not quite.

3158
02:29:10,370 --> 02:29:10,750
Not quite.

3159
02:29:11,110 --> 02:29:12,370
Not quite.

3160
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:15,950
Look at this...

3161
02:29:16,930 --> 02:29:17,530
Chalice.

3162
02:29:18,370 --> 02:29:19,870
I'll just keep it there for now.

3163
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:26,600
I don't know why I'm keeping this lantern.

3164
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:27,140
It's broken.

3165
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:30,080
Oh, there's another one.

3166
02:29:33,630 --> 02:29:34,450
Any more?

3167
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:42,100
The ambience here.

3168
02:29:47,260 --> 02:29:48,720
Already holding slug.

3169
02:29:48,760 --> 02:29:49,160
Okay.

3170
02:30:01,470 --> 02:30:02,150
Hmm.

3171
02:30:03,850 --> 02:30:04,530
Something.

3172
02:30:06,890 --> 02:30:09,270
Do you know what a real is?

3173
02:30:09,730 --> 02:30:10,410
Yes!

3174
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:12,130
Oh!

3175
02:30:12,690 --> 02:30:13,950
I forgot about...

3176
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:18,790
I know what a real is.

3177
02:30:18,870 --> 02:30:19,830
Thank you very much.

3178
02:30:28,670 --> 02:30:31,410
Oh, probably needs though the lantern, right?

3179
02:30:34,110 --> 02:30:35,170
Maybe up top.

3180
02:30:36,170 --> 02:30:36,850
Maybe up top.

3181
02:30:36,850 --> 02:30:42,310
Are you sure?

3182
02:30:43,490 --> 02:30:44,010
Yes!

3183
02:30:45,590 --> 02:30:46,110
Ah!

3184
02:30:46,110 --> 02:30:47,170
I told you.

3185
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:03,090
You were on just then!

3186
02:31:03,390 --> 02:31:04,350
I saw it!

3187
02:31:04,410 --> 02:31:05,970
It literally showed up on the screen!

3188
02:31:13,080 --> 02:31:15,980
Oh, but if I use my light, it works in the same way.

3189
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:17,400
Interesting.

3190
02:31:21,660 --> 02:31:22,140
Um...

3191
02:31:29,810 --> 02:31:30,290
Oh!

3192
02:31:30,290 --> 02:31:30,430
No!

3193
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:30,750
No!

3194
02:31:30,750 --> 02:31:30,890
No!

3195
02:31:30,890 --> 02:31:32,470
I think I just...

3196
02:31:33,350 --> 02:31:33,830
Oh!

3197
02:31:34,630 --> 02:31:35,810
What does this mean?

3198
02:31:37,310 --> 02:31:39,170
Mint, do you know what a lantern is?

3199
02:31:40,810 --> 02:31:41,290
Stop!

3200
02:31:43,870 --> 02:31:46,850
Okay, we'll go find another lantern.

3201
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:52,680
Glad to see you returning to Outer Wilds.

3202
02:31:56,320 --> 02:31:56,840
Oh!

3203
02:31:56,980 --> 02:31:58,020
That one works over there.

3204
02:31:58,180 --> 02:32:02,860
I did truly only plan on taking this... doing this in like two streams, but...

3205
02:32:03,380 --> 02:32:04,820
It might take longer.

3206
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:06,440
At this rate.

3207
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,300
At my Minto pace.

3208
02:32:23,480 --> 02:32:24,600
Let's go up into here.

3209
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:26,400
Maybe we can grab that.

3210
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:27,720
Working lantern.

3211
02:32:29,940 --> 02:32:31,540
This is my first time...

3212
02:32:33,860 --> 02:32:34,320
Uh...

3213
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:37,880
Oh, my first time I tried using the scout to light it.

3214
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:38,020
Ah!

3215
02:32:38,440 --> 02:32:39,260
Oh see, here we go.

3216
02:32:44,010 --> 02:32:44,470
Space.

3217
02:32:47,290 --> 02:32:48,310
Little deer men.

3218
02:32:51,670 --> 02:32:52,130
Um...

3219
02:32:52,720 --> 02:32:53,510
In the bayou.

3220
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:58,210
Chillaxin'.

3221
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:07,500
Oh!

3222
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:09,420
Ah!

3223
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:16,710
I think we're fine.

3224
02:33:16,850 --> 02:33:17,050
Oh.

3225
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:22,540
Um...

3226
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:24,280
That's kind of scary.

3227
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:25,340
All the lights go out.

3228
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:26,380
Oh gosh, it's Titanic.

3229
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:28,520
Oh, never let go, Jack.

3230
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:29,860
Go to the boat!

3231
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:30,480
Go to the boat!

3232
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:31,040
Go to the boat!

3233
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:34,120
Get on the boat!

3234
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:36,640
Oh, I'm fine.

3235
02:33:39,020 --> 02:33:40,620
Don't mean a damn thing to me.

3236
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:41,500
Get it?

3237
02:33:54,100 --> 02:33:56,520
We can continue onwards, actually.

3238
02:34:05,110 --> 02:34:08,570
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi...

3239
02:34:08,570 --> 02:34:08,690
We have

3240
02:34:11,790 --> 02:34:15,450
to get on to one of these like as it floods because we wouldn't reach it otherwise.

3241
02:34:18,570 --> 02:34:19,090
Like...

3242
02:34:19,910 --> 02:34:20,430
No!

3243
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:22,010
Ah!

3244
02:34:24,750 --> 02:34:25,270
Hahaha!

3245
02:34:26,710 --> 02:34:29,030
Wait, this is the same place as before, isn't it not?

3246
02:34:33,860 --> 02:34:36,760
But they seem to, like, always... why are... ooh, see?

3247
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:38,560
It looks just like the guy from Over the Garden Wall!

3248
02:34:40,380 --> 02:34:44,860
But it seems... these guys... seem to always exist in the dark.

3249
02:34:46,220 --> 02:34:47,440
Did I leave my bolt?

3250
02:34:47,620 --> 02:34:48,160
There it goes.

3251
02:34:50,360 --> 02:34:51,720
There's that place over there too.

3252
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:55,320
We can still explore a little bit, even though we lost the dam.

3253
02:34:59,730 --> 02:35:00,190
Ahem.

3254
02:35:04,430 --> 02:35:05,970
Yeah, they like the dark.

3255
02:35:14,430 --> 02:35:15,750
I'm afraid of the dark.

3256
02:35:17,290 --> 02:35:19,450
Oh, wait, it's another... oh, it's this room.

3257
02:35:19,830 --> 02:35:20,590
But different.

3258
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:29,920
I'm a little afraid of the dark, though.

3259
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:32,560
Am I gonna not like this DLC?

3260
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:35,600
I think I'm not gonna like this DLC.

3261
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:37,600
If I'm afraid of the dark.

3262
02:35:39,220 --> 02:35:40,420
Oh god, it's so scary!

3263
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:46,540
Stop turning on my flashlight!

3264
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:49,920
Oh...

3265
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:52,780
Oh...

3266
02:35:53,580 --> 02:35:54,200
Oh no!

3267
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:55,480
No!

3268
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:56,220
We lost...

3269
02:35:56,220 --> 02:35:57,600
I'm such an idiot.

3270
02:35:57,820 --> 02:35:58,940
I knew that would happen, though.

3271
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:01,920
Because I already saw it happen before.

3272
02:36:04,420 --> 02:36:06,220
The mirrors are starting to get darker.

3273
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:09,020
What did you expect?

3274
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:11,280
I forgot!

3275
02:36:12,020 --> 02:36:12,720
I forgot!

3276
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:15,160
Oh yeah, we...

3277
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:17,000
Remove slide window.

3278
02:36:20,470 --> 02:36:21,350
There were more.

3279
02:36:21,590 --> 02:36:22,330
Yeah, there were more.

3280
02:36:23,330 --> 02:36:24,850
Probably for people like me.

3281
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:29,750
Wouldn't want to see any ghosts in the... Stop!

3282
02:36:30,850 --> 02:36:32,310
I'm afraid of other ghosts!

3283
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:48,460
Any others in here?

3284
02:36:51,980 --> 02:36:52,600
Okay.

3285
02:36:55,850 --> 02:36:56,830
What's that sound?

3286
02:36:57,470 --> 02:36:58,090
Oh.

3287
02:36:59,730 --> 02:37:01,310
Okay, I think this just goes outside.

3288
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:02,250
Yeah.

3289
02:37:03,410 --> 02:37:05,090
But I can swim!

3290
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:06,990
I'm not so useless.

3291
02:37:09,390 --> 02:37:10,650
I can still swim!

3292
02:37:12,730 --> 02:37:13,350
Okay.

3293
02:37:15,070 --> 02:37:15,690
Where...

3294
02:37:15,690 --> 02:37:18,170
I think our boat is gone-gone.

3295
02:37:19,230 --> 02:37:20,710
Oh, there's another raft!

3296
02:37:20,710 --> 02:37:21,210
See?

3297
02:37:23,530 --> 02:37:25,250
I mean, I'm afraid of other humans.

3298
02:37:25,350 --> 02:37:25,690
See?

3299
02:37:25,850 --> 02:37:28,250
It's not so weird, then, if I'm afraid of other ghosts.

3300
02:37:30,270 --> 02:37:32,170
Our boat is gone-gone.

3301
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:37,780
Huh.

3302
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:39,160
Let's...

3303
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:43,060
So...

3304
02:37:43,060 --> 02:37:45,240
Does the sun not explode here?

3305
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:47,180
Or is that what caused the...

3306
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:47,280
The...

3307
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:49,300
The...

3308
02:37:49,300 --> 02:37:49,880
You know...

3309
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,400
Oh, gosh.

3310
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:53,300
It's getting really dark in here!

3311
02:37:53,460 --> 02:37:54,240
Oh, gosh!

3312
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:54,900
It's scary!

3313
02:37:56,520 --> 02:37:58,340
Is that what caused the dam to break?

3314
02:38:02,340 --> 02:38:04,420
I did see the sun through here.

3315
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:07,240
But...

3316
02:38:08,180 --> 02:38:08,680
Oh!

3317
02:38:09,140 --> 02:38:09,640
No!

3318
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:12,080
You son of a bitch!

3319
02:38:13,320 --> 02:38:14,440
You son of a bitch!

3320
02:38:18,610 --> 02:38:21,050
You son of

3321
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:25,590
a bitch!

3322
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:28,750
I'm afraid of what happens when I take all of these.

3323
02:38:28,890 --> 02:38:30,750
Because it's getting really dark in here.

3324
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:37,990
It's getting really dark in there.

3325
02:38:39,810 --> 02:38:40,410
Okay.

3326
02:38:40,850 --> 02:38:41,690
All right.

3327
02:38:46,150 --> 02:38:46,750
Nice.

3328
02:38:49,470 --> 02:38:49,910
Okay.

3329
02:38:50,310 --> 02:38:50,910
Okay.

3330
02:38:52,970 --> 02:38:53,570
Okay.

3331
02:38:53,770 --> 02:38:55,550
We got the stuff in there.

3332
02:38:56,350 --> 02:38:56,950
Damnit!

3333
02:38:56,950 --> 02:38:58,530
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

3334
02:38:59,730 --> 02:39:01,530
Thank you so, so much!

3335
02:39:01,650 --> 02:39:02,130
Thank you!

3336
02:39:02,850 --> 02:39:03,790
Oh, my goodness.

3337
02:39:04,310 --> 02:39:06,510
Why are you guys gifting so much?

3338
02:39:07,050 --> 02:39:08,170
I've gotten, like...

3339
02:39:08,170 --> 02:39:10,530
There was even an Akasupa I saw before...

3340
02:39:10,530 --> 02:39:12,510
Before the stream even started!

3341
02:39:12,990 --> 02:39:13,790
The eye!

3342
02:39:19,640 --> 02:39:21,660
The eye and...

3343
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:25,300
Matara-Khan...

3344
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,320
Lantern...

3345
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:28,960
Space.

3346
02:39:35,430 --> 02:39:36,170
I'm scared.

3347
02:39:36,410 --> 02:39:36,610
What's...

3348
02:39:37,290 --> 02:39:38,050
I'm scared!

3349
02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:38,470
I'm scared!

3350
02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:38,810
I'm scared!

3351
02:39:43,410 --> 02:39:45,450
They are also looking at the eye.

3352
02:39:45,790 --> 02:39:46,210
Wait.

3353
02:39:46,230 --> 02:39:47,230
Are they trying to find the eye, too?

3354
02:39:54,850 --> 02:39:55,850
It's a motion picture.

3355
02:39:59,830 --> 02:40:01,290
They're scanning the eye.

3356
02:40:02,310 --> 02:40:03,070
It's a bird.

3357
02:40:10,580 --> 02:40:11,760
Oh, my God.

3358
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:13,420
He's observing the power of the eye.

3359
02:40:14,660 --> 02:40:15,180
Oh!

3360
02:40:15,380 --> 02:40:16,620
He's making the eye...

3361
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:17,860
He's corrupting the eye!

3362
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:20,680
The eye will say so until he happens.

3363
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:27,400
The eye is destroying the universe.

3364
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:27,740
Hello?

3365
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:28,180
What?

3366
02:40:29,700 --> 02:40:30,220
Oh!

3367
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:31,380
And him, too.

3368
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:33,820
Nature.

3369
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:36,000
Happens.

3370
02:40:36,180 --> 02:40:36,700
Oh!

3371
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:36,960
Oh!

3372
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:37,260
Oh!

3373
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:39,640
I feel loved and supported, nerds.

3374
02:40:53,890 --> 02:40:54,770
We are...

3375
02:40:54,770 --> 02:40:57,390
If the eye is against us, we are against the eye.

3376
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:04,520
Wait.

3377
02:41:04,520 --> 02:41:05,720
So, they worship the eye.

3378
02:41:05,780 --> 02:41:06,800
See, him and then...

3379
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:08,360
They were like, no, the eye doesn't...

3380
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:10,880
Destroy all...

3381
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:12,280
All worship of the eye.

3382
02:41:14,140 --> 02:41:15,320
The eye is evil.

3383
02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:15,860
The eye is...

3384
02:41:25,850 --> 02:41:27,330
The music is so scary.

3385
02:41:28,390 --> 02:41:29,590
What are they doing there?

3386
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:35,440
Something is going to pop up.

3387
02:41:39,140 --> 02:41:40,880
Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

3388
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:47,140
Oh.

3389
02:41:50,330 --> 02:41:51,650
And this is our...

3390
02:41:51,650 --> 02:41:52,910
This is our solar system.

3391
02:41:53,750 --> 02:41:55,050
Because there's Timber Hearth.

3392
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:55,570
There's...

3393
02:41:56,450 --> 02:41:56,910
There's...

3394
02:41:58,830 --> 02:41:59,790
There's Brutal Hall.

3395
02:42:00,010 --> 02:42:00,310
There's...

3396
02:42:00,310 --> 02:42:00,450
Yeah.

3397
02:42:00,530 --> 02:42:01,730
There's the Ash Twins.

3398
02:42:02,970 --> 02:42:03,910
Oh, here we come.

3399
02:42:04,510 --> 02:42:04,930
Oh.

3400
02:42:09,010 --> 02:42:09,650
Eclipse.

3401
02:42:17,310 --> 02:42:19,990
This has been here the whole time?

3402
02:42:36,150 --> 02:42:37,410
Let's do the next one.

3403
02:42:39,870 --> 02:42:42,010
I wish the music would come back.

3404
02:42:42,310 --> 02:42:42,670
It's...

3405
02:42:42,670 --> 02:42:44,210
Otherwise, it's so...

3406
02:42:44,210 --> 02:42:45,290
It's so quiet.

3407
02:42:47,450 --> 02:42:48,090
Okay.

3408
02:42:53,610 --> 02:42:54,190
Oh, no.

3409
02:42:59,580 --> 02:43:01,100
I think that's our signal.

3410
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:02,080
We're running out of time.

3411
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:05,020
A bit.

3412
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:09,300
Oh, our boat.

3413
02:43:10,220 --> 02:43:13,380
Well, good thing we got the lantern before it.

3414
02:43:15,020 --> 02:43:15,940
Yeah, there's another side.

3415
02:43:16,040 --> 02:43:16,340
Don't worry.

3416
02:43:16,400 --> 02:43:17,260
I'm going to go look at it.

3417
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:18,280
Just wanted to make sure.

3418
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:19,320
Oh.

3419
02:43:19,820 --> 02:43:20,180
Oh.

3420
02:43:20,260 --> 02:43:20,640
Uh-oh.

3421
02:43:20,660 --> 02:43:21,360
Oh, no, no, no.

3422
02:43:21,560 --> 02:43:21,920
Wait.

3423
02:43:21,980 --> 02:43:22,140
Wait.

3424
02:43:22,180 --> 02:43:22,340
Wait.

3425
02:43:22,340 --> 02:43:22,520
Wait.

3426
02:43:22,520 --> 02:43:22,740
Wait.

3427
02:43:22,740 --> 02:43:22,960
Wait.

3428
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:23,160
Wait.

3429
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:23,300
Wait.

3430
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:23,360
Wait.

3431
02:43:23,360 --> 02:43:23,600
Wait.

3432
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:24,200
Wait.

3433
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:24,360
Wait.

3434
02:43:24,460 --> 02:43:24,520
Wait.

3435
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:24,640
Wait.

3436
02:43:24,740 --> 02:43:24,920
Wait.

3437
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:25,060
Wait.

3438
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:27,280
Uh...

3439
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:32,640
I don't like that.

3440
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:38,620
Why did you take that picture, you weirdo?

3441
02:43:38,820 --> 02:43:39,840
What is that thing?

3442
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:44,280
Oh.

3443
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:44,760
Whoa.

3444
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:45,460
Whoa.

3445
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,160
Oh, it locks...

3446
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:48,100
It locks...

3447
02:43:48,100 --> 02:43:48,220
Wait.

3448
02:43:48,280 --> 02:43:50,760
But there was three eyes in the picture of Matara.

3449
02:43:52,420 --> 02:43:54,440
So, it locks it if...

3450
02:43:54,440 --> 02:43:54,800
If we...

3451
02:43:55,480 --> 02:43:57,160
So, if we stop...

3452
02:43:57,160 --> 02:44:01,180
If we lock up the eye, it will stop from destroying us?

3453
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:03,040
Just for fun?

3454
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:09,300
We have to get this guy to absorb into what is going on in the...

3455
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,180
Ship log updated.

3456
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:11,540
Okay.

3457
02:44:11,580 --> 02:44:15,380
At least we got that before we got eaten by the sun.

3458
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:24,900
Oh, ouch.

3459
02:44:27,620 --> 02:44:29,840
So, this is probably of some significance.

3460
02:44:30,040 --> 02:44:30,560
Before...

3461
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:31,940
And...

3462
02:44:31,940 --> 02:44:32,600
Oh, see?

3463
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:33,120
See?

3464
02:44:33,180 --> 02:44:34,560
It's like...

3465
02:44:35,420 --> 02:44:36,220
Oh, shoot.

3466
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:37,720
Oh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.

3467
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:39,060
Hold on.

3468
02:44:39,100 --> 02:44:39,720
I'm not done, son.

3469
02:44:40,340 --> 02:44:41,380
I'm not done yet.

3470
02:44:43,100 --> 02:44:43,500
Shoot.

3471
02:44:46,380 --> 02:44:46,780
Okay.

3472
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:53,340
There we go.

3473
02:44:56,720 --> 02:44:57,120
Hello?

3474
02:44:57,820 --> 02:44:58,220
Son?

3475
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:00,540
Hello?

3476
02:45:01,580 --> 02:45:02,300
Are you going to...

3477
02:45:02,900 --> 02:45:04,420
Are you going to blow us up or...

3478
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:05,600
Or what?

3479
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:09,680
Oh!

3480
02:45:09,800 --> 02:45:10,420
There we go.

3481
02:45:18,670 --> 02:45:19,010
Interesting.

3482
02:45:19,570 --> 02:45:19,830
Interesting.

3483
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:22,730
Oh man, I'm going to have to go find this place again, aren't I?

3484
02:45:23,930 --> 02:45:24,670
Kind of sucks.

3485
02:45:46,270 --> 02:45:47,290
Sorry, I'm eating cucumber.

3486
02:45:48,290 --> 02:45:48,630
Oh!

3487
02:45:49,550 --> 02:45:50,450
Hey, hold up a sec.

3488
02:45:50,670 --> 02:45:51,270
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

3489
02:45:51,270 --> 02:45:52,550
Yeah, I already know about the launch codes.

3490
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:19,640
How convenient!

3491
02:46:24,940 --> 02:46:25,400
Incredible ideas!

3492
02:46:25,720 --> 02:46:28,600
Oh, I do the best I can with what I've got.

3493
02:46:28,680 --> 02:46:29,560
Really, you're too kind.

3494
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:31,720
Slate, you are a technological marvel.

3495
02:46:32,540 --> 02:46:32,940
Whoa!

3496
02:46:33,060 --> 02:46:34,040
Say that again, please!

3497
02:46:34,440 --> 02:46:36,300
That sounds so good when it's not sarcastic.

3498
02:46:36,700 --> 02:46:38,560
Anyways, I've got a fire to enjoy.

3499
02:46:38,820 --> 02:46:40,620
And you've got launch codes to grab.

3500
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:42,960
Go wild with the marking feature while you're out there.

3501
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:47,040
Just try not to follow it so directly you fly into the sun, okay?

3502
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:49,860
I would never do that!

3503
02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:56,360
I would never, ever, ever do that.

3504
02:47:02,270 --> 02:47:03,950
Is there a stranger?

3505
02:47:13,720 --> 02:47:18,560
A massive artificial ring world hidden within some sort of cloaking field.

3506
02:47:18,700 --> 02:47:23,080
It does not appear to be Hearthian or Nomian in origin.

3507
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:29,140
A slide wheel from the Cinder Isles.

3508
02:47:29,860 --> 02:47:33,820
Showed a glowing symbol and chains appear around a strange vault.

3509
02:47:36,980 --> 02:47:38,020
Bless you.

3510
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:38,560
Thank you.

3511
02:47:40,780 --> 02:47:44,480
A pair of small rocky islands connected by a village of stilt houses.

3512
02:47:44,820 --> 02:47:46,080
There's more to explore here.

3513
02:47:47,320 --> 02:47:52,440
A slide wheel that shows the stranger's inhabitants analyzing the eye of the universe.

3514
02:47:52,700 --> 02:47:55,160
Several slides have been burned and cannot be viewed.

3515
02:47:55,460 --> 02:47:57,700
I wonder if we can find one that hasn't been burned.

3516
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,800
A low-lying region near the entrance to the stranger.

3517
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:05,560
There are wooden buildings along the banks of the river.

3518
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:09,460
Oh my goodness, we have so much to explore now.

3519
02:48:10,300 --> 02:48:11,380
Mark location!

3520
02:48:12,380 --> 02:48:12,920
Yippee!

3521
02:48:15,360 --> 02:48:16,520
There's the stranger!

3522
02:48:18,440 --> 02:48:19,520
Good morning!

3523
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:20,480
Good morning!

3524
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:25,660
Oh!

3525
02:48:26,240 --> 02:48:27,340
Bye, Adlerock.

3526
02:48:28,280 --> 02:48:30,340
So if I just go like this...

3527
02:48:31,360 --> 02:48:31,900
Will I reach it?

3528
02:48:35,580 --> 02:48:36,140
There we go.

3529
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:38,300
Stranger danger.

3530
02:48:53,730 --> 02:48:54,130
Inward!

3531
02:48:55,730 --> 02:48:56,330
Oh gosh.

3532
02:48:56,510 --> 02:48:57,030
Oh, I have to...

3533
02:48:57,030 --> 02:48:58,910
I have to do all of this again, though.

3534
02:48:59,010 --> 02:48:59,410
Oh gosh.

3535
02:49:00,590 --> 02:49:00,990
Okay.

3536
02:49:02,250 --> 02:49:02,650
Ah!

3537
02:49:03,270 --> 02:49:03,670
Wait!

3538
02:49:18,760 --> 02:49:19,560
We're fine.

3539
02:49:21,380 --> 02:49:21,900
Um...

3540
02:49:21,900 --> 02:49:22,460
Yup.

3541
02:49:23,180 --> 02:49:23,700
Perfect.

3542
02:49:27,670 --> 02:49:28,190
Perfect!

3543
02:49:32,690 --> 02:49:33,590
See you, guys.

3544
02:49:37,990 --> 02:49:38,790
Oh my god.

3545
02:49:38,830 --> 02:49:40,470
My own footsteps scared me.

3546
02:49:40,510 --> 02:49:42,630
I thought I heard, like, someone else walking around.

3547
02:49:45,850 --> 02:49:46,370
Flawless.

3548
02:49:46,470 --> 02:49:46,930
I know.

3549
02:49:48,170 --> 02:49:49,210
Oh, one second.

3550
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:51,310
Um...

3551
02:49:53,390 --> 02:49:56,830
Ghosts are super effective against other ghosts, so it makes sense for you to be afraid.

3552
02:49:57,870 --> 02:49:58,310
Exactly.

3553
02:49:59,730 --> 02:50:01,050
I see the best landing.

3554
02:50:01,210 --> 02:50:01,850
Thank you!

3555
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:06,880
Keep going.

3556
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:08,300
Keep going.

3557
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:09,380
Keep going.

3558
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:13,440
Oh.

3559
02:50:13,960 --> 02:50:14,640
Oh, shoot.

3560
02:50:14,820 --> 02:50:16,460
How did I do it so flawlessly before?

3561
02:50:16,900 --> 02:50:17,340
Wait.

3562
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:17,880
No, no, no, no.

3563
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:17,900
No.

3564
02:50:23,460 --> 02:50:24,300
I don't want to say it.

3565
02:50:25,420 --> 02:50:26,020
Stop it.

3566
02:50:28,960 --> 02:50:30,660
Just scare yourself all the time.

3567
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:33,120
All the time.

3568
02:50:34,480 --> 02:50:34,920
Chubby!

3569
02:50:35,740 --> 02:50:36,780
Welcome back for your trip.

3570
02:50:36,840 --> 02:50:37,260
Thank you!

3571
02:50:43,280 --> 02:50:43,720
Stop!

3572
02:50:43,720 --> 02:50:43,840
Stop!

3573
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:50,140
I did it, like, so perfectly before.

3574
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:54,800
There we go.

3575
02:51:02,170 --> 02:51:03,010
Okay.

3576
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:07,670
Let's go.

3577
02:51:09,650 --> 02:51:10,250
Come on.

3578
02:51:11,730 --> 02:51:12,790
I'm piloting you.

3579
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:13,870
Let's go.

3580
02:51:13,870 --> 02:51:14,050
Believe in yourself.

3581
02:51:18,840 --> 02:51:20,220
Oh, I have to push it.

3582
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:26,020
Where should we go?

3583
02:51:28,960 --> 02:51:30,340
Oh, there's so much to explore.

3584
02:51:31,140 --> 02:51:32,340
Wait, this is a ghost mato.

3585
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:35,900
Oh, this has ghost matter written all over it.

3586
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:38,100
Did the ghost matter also kill them too?

3587
02:51:42,900 --> 02:51:44,000
What the hell is that?

3588
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:45,020
What was that?

3589
02:51:45,880 --> 02:51:46,860
Did you guys see that?

3590
02:51:48,500 --> 02:51:49,340
It just...

3591
02:51:50,840 --> 02:51:52,280
It disappeared out of existence.

3592
02:51:52,940 --> 02:51:54,980
There was like a little egg and it was dancing.

3593
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:00,360
Oh, it's that thing up there.

3594
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:00,940
That symbol.

3595
02:52:02,080 --> 02:52:04,020
Can we get in at all?

3596
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:05,960
Oh,

3597
02:52:10,880 --> 02:52:12,760
it's hard when it's sideways.

3598
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:14,300
No, there was something there.

3599
02:52:14,420 --> 02:52:14,880
I promise.

3600
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:17,540
I promise.

3601
02:52:17,640 --> 02:52:17,960
I promise.

3602
02:52:21,550 --> 02:52:22,420
Be careful.

3603
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:23,620
Be careful.

3604
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:24,200
That's me.

3605
02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:26,300
Be careful, guys.

3606
02:52:26,340 --> 02:52:26,700
Be careful.

3607
02:52:34,480 --> 02:52:35,640
Oh, no.

3608
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:40,400
Can I even get inside?

3609
02:52:50,910 --> 02:52:51,690
I'm dead.

3610
02:52:51,930 --> 02:52:52,750
I'm dead.

3611
02:52:53,470 --> 02:52:56,450
I fell off.

3612
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:17,080
Oh my God.

3613
02:53:17,180 --> 02:53:18,400
That was so stupid.

3614
02:53:23,540 --> 02:53:24,460
Oh man.

3615
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:27,100
Oh, fell off... ratio.

3616
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:40,800
Yeah, keep the HUD marker there.

3617
02:53:40,900 --> 02:53:41,540
I can't do this.

3618
02:53:41,540 --> 02:53:42,580
That's all we're going, baby.

3619
02:53:43,640 --> 02:53:44,560
Nowhere else to go.

3620
02:53:47,480 --> 02:53:49,900
My throat doesn't hurt, I just can't stop coughing.

3621
02:54:00,760 --> 02:54:02,080
Check for the egg again.

3622
02:54:02,200 --> 02:54:02,800
Yeah, we should!

3623
02:54:03,080 --> 02:54:03,380
We should!

3624
02:54:05,620 --> 02:54:07,120
That was a dancing egg!

3625
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:11,680
I knew it!

3626
02:54:11,800 --> 02:54:12,180
I saw it!

3627
02:54:22,790 --> 02:54:23,350
Okay.

3628
02:54:23,730 --> 02:54:24,290
Easy.

3629
02:54:24,610 --> 02:54:25,570
Easy does it.

3630
02:54:26,210 --> 02:54:26,770
Easy.

3631
02:54:33,180 --> 02:54:34,500
Ah, perfect landing.

3632
02:54:38,020 --> 02:54:38,880
Where's the door?

3633
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:39,420
There it is.

3634
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:41,720
Hey!

3635
02:54:41,880 --> 02:54:42,860
Perfect landing.

3636
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:44,480
Flawless.

3637
02:54:44,480 --> 02:54:45,280
Nice flip.

3638
02:54:45,440 --> 02:54:45,880
Thank you.

3639
02:54:53,410 --> 02:54:54,030
Blub, blub, blub, blub.

3640
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:01,380
There we go.

3641
02:55:03,620 --> 02:55:04,100
Yippee!

3642
02:55:05,480 --> 02:55:07,100
Alright, let's get that egg.

3643
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:08,620
Oh, uh, push the raft.

3644
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:13,500
It's over there!

3645
02:55:13,800 --> 02:55:14,540
There's an egg!

3646
02:55:14,620 --> 02:55:15,280
There's an egg!

3647
02:55:15,360 --> 02:55:16,100
I promise you!

3648
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:22,090
Yeah!

3649
02:55:22,650 --> 02:55:23,830
Crash into it!

3650
02:55:27,210 --> 02:55:27,690
What?

3651
02:55:33,440 --> 02:55:37,020
Uh... I prom... I promise there was an egg.

3652
02:55:37,800 --> 02:55:38,580
Oh my god.

3653
02:55:38,680 --> 02:55:40,840
I promise you, there was something there.

3654
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:50,400
It was... it was... it was dancing around!

3655
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:53,560
It was!

3656
02:55:53,820 --> 02:55:54,480
It was!

3657
02:55:54,600 --> 02:55:55,300
It was there!

3658
02:55:55,960 --> 02:55:57,140
It was there!

3659
02:55:57,840 --> 02:55:58,740
No way!

3660
02:56:00,400 --> 02:56:01,600
No way!

3661
02:56:01,960 --> 02:56:03,080
It can't be gone!

3662
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:05,960
Well, let's land here.

3663
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:07,600
Maybe.

3664
02:56:07,820 --> 02:56:08,260
Here.

3665
02:56:08,860 --> 02:56:09,460
Yup.

3666
02:56:09,540 --> 02:56:10,260
Right here.

3667
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:12,520
Exactly where I wanted to land.

3668
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,180
What the...

3669
02:56:15,180 --> 02:56:16,980
Oh, it's a goodbye ship.

3670
02:56:20,460 --> 02:56:21,800
There was something there!

3671
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:31,120
Oh, oh, I pressed the wrong button.

3672
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:32,720
Gotcha!

3673
02:56:34,560 --> 02:56:38,740
This is where... we were before, is it not?

3674
02:56:39,160 --> 02:56:39,720
Okay.

3675
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:43,940
Yeah, I remember all these portraits and stuff.

3676
02:56:45,700 --> 02:56:46,260
Yeah.

3677
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:49,500
God, these guys are kind of vain, aren't they?

3678
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:53,700
Sure.

3679
02:56:54,760 --> 02:56:55,800
I promise.

3680
02:56:57,140 --> 02:56:58,200
It was there.

3681
02:57:00,080 --> 02:57:01,880
No, this is actually a different one.

3682
02:57:02,420 --> 02:57:04,180
But we need a lantern.

3683
02:57:04,500 --> 02:57:05,200
A working lantern.

3684
02:57:11,150 --> 02:57:12,710
No, you're just meant...

3685
02:57:13,390 --> 02:57:14,870
Please, the VOD.

3686
02:57:16,350 --> 02:57:19,090
The VOD will save my sanity.

3687
02:57:24,230 --> 02:57:25,970
This is a bad dad family portrait.

3688
02:57:26,150 --> 02:57:27,370
Look how many they have, though!

3689
02:57:29,070 --> 02:57:32,830
Actually, I want to keep just kind of exploring, like, other places a little bit.

3690
02:57:34,330 --> 02:57:37,630
I can't... I can't do anything there anyway, because I don't have a working lantern.

3691
02:57:38,030 --> 02:57:38,550
Look at them!

3692
02:57:38,770 --> 02:57:40,430
There's pictures of these guys everywhere!

3693
02:57:46,270 --> 02:57:48,390
I want to see, like, what this is, too.

3694
02:57:51,770 --> 02:57:53,590
Oh, this is for the boat!

3695
02:57:54,070 --> 02:57:54,490
Okay.

3696
02:57:55,850 --> 02:57:56,510
Okay, okay.

3697
02:57:56,510 --> 02:57:56,590
Okay.

3698
02:57:59,950 --> 02:58:02,890
Jeffrey, what did you put in Mint's oxygen tanks?

3699
02:58:03,330 --> 02:58:05,030
I swear there was something there!

3700
02:58:05,710 --> 02:58:06,550
I promise!

3701
02:58:07,450 --> 02:58:08,850
I wouldn't just make that up!

3702
02:58:11,110 --> 02:58:11,950
Broken lantern...

3703
02:58:13,270 --> 02:58:14,650
Why would I make that up?

3704
02:58:15,410 --> 02:58:17,550
Why would I say there's an egg there, and not mean it?

3705
02:58:18,650 --> 02:58:19,490
Wait, um...

3706
02:58:21,910 --> 02:58:22,870
Okay, okay, okay.

3707
02:58:23,590 --> 02:58:24,010
Ahem.

3708
02:58:26,510 --> 02:58:27,970
This is where I was at before.

3709
02:58:29,670 --> 02:58:33,450
Okay, so we have been to all of this then.

3710
02:58:33,510 --> 02:58:34,670
We have seen these then.

3711
02:58:35,530 --> 02:58:38,310
Maybe it just looked different because it was all sunken underwater.

3712
02:58:41,570 --> 02:58:43,750
She's not lying, she's just haunted.

3713
02:58:44,790 --> 02:58:47,910
She would absolutely make it up!

3714
02:58:52,950 --> 02:58:53,890
Yeah, I would.

3715
02:58:54,210 --> 02:58:55,070
You're right.

3716
02:59:01,060 --> 02:59:02,440
You're a soup!

3717
02:59:02,620 --> 02:59:03,380
You're a soup!

3718
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:04,520
Thank you!

3719
02:59:06,920 --> 02:59:09,360
Says the girl who made up the face in the mirror.

3720
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:10,480
Oh, no, see, this is Nil!

3721
02:59:11,940 --> 02:59:13,300
Okay, I'm not crazy.

3722
02:59:13,660 --> 02:59:14,980
As crazy as I thought.

3723
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:16,740
The eye goes...

3724
02:59:17,540 --> 02:59:18,040
Whoa!

3725
02:59:21,720 --> 02:59:23,360
Okay, that's their planet.

3726
02:59:24,540 --> 02:59:25,580
And they were like...

3727
02:59:25,580 --> 02:59:26,720
What is this?

3728
02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:28,540
What is... Wow!

3729
02:59:28,540 --> 02:59:30,120
It's powering our stuff!

3730
02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:31,240
Whoa-ee!

3731
02:59:31,740 --> 02:59:33,680
Whoa, I'm seeing everything.

3732
02:59:39,440 --> 02:59:44,640
Oh my God!

3733
02:59:45,380 --> 02:59:46,960
He's grabbing his antlers.

3734
02:59:46,960 --> 02:59:47,780
He's so shocked.

3735
02:59:48,040 --> 02:59:48,640
What?

3736
02:59:51,340 --> 02:59:52,600
Oh my God!

3737
02:59:52,780 --> 02:59:53,660
Hey, come look at this!

3738
02:59:54,960 --> 02:59:55,600
Whoa!

3739
02:59:55,800 --> 02:59:56,440
Whoa!

3740
02:59:56,680 --> 02:59:57,320
Woo!

3741
03:00:05,380 --> 03:00:08,260
They're really trying hard to delete this evidence.

3742
03:00:09,100 --> 03:00:10,720
And so they built their little...

3743
03:00:10,720 --> 03:00:12,980
They built their space thing.

3744
03:00:14,200 --> 03:00:17,360
Their portable planet.

3745
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:20,160
And they went...

3746
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:20,240
Pew!

3747
03:00:21,240 --> 03:00:22,420
All the way!

3748
03:00:23,240 --> 03:00:25,000
They hid their trade secrets.

3749
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:25,840
It's kind of messed up.

3750
03:00:32,160 --> 03:00:33,440
And then they were like...

3751
03:00:33,440 --> 03:00:35,360
Okay, let's go meet the eye of the universe!

3752
03:00:37,540 --> 03:00:37,980
Okay.

3753
03:00:40,380 --> 03:00:43,160
Yeah, there's three eyes on the MataraCon machine.

3754
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:53,640
I'm scared of the spooky, because some people were like...

3755
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:55,820
I had to stop playing this because it got too spooky.

3756
03:00:56,360 --> 03:00:57,820
And I'm scared when...

3757
03:00:57,820 --> 03:01:01,500
It's a little eerie right now, but I'm afraid of the real spooky happening.

3758
03:01:06,360 --> 03:01:07,240
That's another...

3759
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:12,060
So glad you're playing, Peek.

3760
03:01:12,060 --> 03:01:12,400
Hope you're having a good time.

3761
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:13,160
Your volume is low.

3762
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:14,580
What do you mean by that?

3763
03:01:14,720 --> 03:01:15,600
I'm scared now!

3764
03:01:17,780 --> 03:01:18,920
What do you mean by that?

3765
03:01:22,820 --> 03:01:24,060
The vault is open.

3766
03:01:24,940 --> 03:01:26,720
The vault is closing.

3767
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:30,900
Oh no!

3768
03:01:31,020 --> 03:01:32,000
Not this guy again!

3769
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:35,720
Stay away from me!

3770
03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:37,860
Oh.

3771
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:40,080
He's going to this machine again.

3772
03:01:41,720 --> 03:01:43,100
And lighting it up.

3773
03:01:44,100 --> 03:01:44,620
And...

3774
03:01:44,620 --> 03:01:44,700
Oh!

3775
03:01:44,720 --> 03:01:46,100
It seals it.

3776
03:01:50,260 --> 03:01:50,860
Okay.

3777
03:01:51,920 --> 03:01:52,520
Okay.

3778
03:01:54,400 --> 03:01:55,200
Oh God.

3779
03:01:55,280 --> 03:01:56,700
Why did I stop it on that one?

3780
03:01:59,780 --> 03:02:01,420
Okay, let's get out of here.

3781
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:02,280
Let's just leave.

3782
03:02:05,280 --> 03:02:05,880
Okay.

3783
03:02:06,500 --> 03:02:07,100
Okay.

3784
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:09,160
Alright, let's keep going down the bayou.

3785
03:02:09,740 --> 03:02:11,780
Going down the bayou.

3786
03:02:12,480 --> 03:02:14,540
Going down the bayou.

3787
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:16,840
Going down the bayou.

3788
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:19,660
Are we stuck stuck?

3789
03:02:21,480 --> 03:02:22,560
Push the raft.

3790
03:02:24,280 --> 03:02:25,340
Push the raft.

3791
03:02:26,640 --> 03:02:27,320
Okay.

3792
03:02:27,480 --> 03:02:28,440
Oh, nope.

3793
03:02:28,620 --> 03:02:29,180
No!

3794
03:02:29,240 --> 03:02:30,760
I guess that works.

3795
03:02:31,640 --> 03:02:33,040
Ooh, why is it flickering?

3796
03:02:34,440 --> 03:02:35,440
It's interesting.

3797
03:02:35,840 --> 03:02:37,660
That's an interesting effect.

3798
03:02:42,250 --> 03:02:44,130
And then we got our nice music.

3799
03:02:46,270 --> 03:02:47,970
Calm and good.

3800
03:02:48,010 --> 03:02:48,590
Okay.

3801
03:02:48,590 --> 03:02:52,250
And... okay, so that's where we went to before, for sure.

3802
03:02:52,510 --> 03:02:52,710
Oop!

3803
03:02:53,490 --> 03:02:55,670
That is where we went to before, for sure.

3804
03:02:57,650 --> 03:02:59,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3805
03:02:59,750 --> 03:03:02,090
So we haven't gone any further beyond this.

3806
03:03:02,630 --> 03:03:07,850
But I'm curious, what is some of these parts over here that were under the water?

3807
03:03:08,530 --> 03:03:09,130
You know?

3808
03:03:09,890 --> 03:03:10,730
Let's check it out.

3809
03:03:11,090 --> 03:03:12,710
No projection cells.

3810
03:03:13,590 --> 03:03:16,390
It's just the alien version of yelling audio to you.

3811
03:03:16,990 --> 03:03:17,470
Ouch!

3812
03:03:18,430 --> 03:03:19,250
Beam me up!

3813
03:03:19,410 --> 03:03:20,130
Thank you!

3814
03:03:21,130 --> 03:03:23,550
This DLC is almost like a theme park dark ride.

3815
03:03:23,830 --> 03:03:25,150
I sure hope not.

3816
03:03:25,590 --> 03:03:27,790
I sure hope it's not like a dark ride.

3817
03:03:35,570 --> 03:03:37,510
It's my 30th birthday a few days ago!

3818
03:03:37,630 --> 03:03:39,270
I'm now a decade closer to becoming a ghost.

3819
03:03:40,750 --> 03:03:42,410
This is the church they burned!

3820
03:03:43,070 --> 03:03:44,290
Becky, happy birthday!

3821
03:03:46,390 --> 03:03:49,730
Happy birthday to you.

3822
03:03:51,090 --> 03:03:54,570
Happy birthday to you.

3823
03:03:55,390 --> 03:03:59,810
Happy birthday, dear Becky.

3824
03:04:00,270 --> 03:04:02,630
I would clap, but we're on a time limit.

3825
03:04:03,990 --> 03:04:08,590
Happy birthday to you.

3826
03:04:09,950 --> 03:04:11,990
Happy birthday!

3827
03:04:12,310 --> 03:04:13,370
Sorry I'm late.

3828
03:04:13,990 --> 03:04:15,190
Okay.

3829
03:04:15,190 --> 03:04:16,670
This is a boat.

3830
03:04:19,890 --> 03:04:21,150
Let's go over to this area.

3831
03:04:26,340 --> 03:04:27,940
I haven't used my signal scope.

3832
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:28,860
I wonder if there's anything.

3833
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:31,960
Nope.

3834
03:04:32,620 --> 03:04:33,500
Makes sense though.

3835
03:04:37,120 --> 03:04:38,860
But what happened to these guys?

3836
03:04:41,320 --> 03:04:43,040
Did they get eaten by the eye?

3837
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:46,960
A family tree?

3838
03:04:49,640 --> 03:04:52,060
This is so much more mysterious.

3839
03:04:58,780 --> 03:05:00,690
I want to go to the top of this building.

3840
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:05,780
But...

3841
03:05:06,980 --> 03:05:08,400
I don't know how.

3842
03:05:10,040 --> 03:05:12,440
There were stairs that lead inside.

3843
03:05:13,120 --> 03:05:15,180
But there's not stairs that lead up.

3844
03:05:17,980 --> 03:05:19,940
Maybe they autopiloted into the sun.

3845
03:05:20,200 --> 03:05:21,100
They could have.

3846
03:05:22,480 --> 03:05:23,520
Very possible.

3847
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:25,780
Very probable.

3848
03:05:26,200 --> 03:05:27,760
More likely than you think.

3849
03:05:29,160 --> 03:05:29,680
Okay.

3850
03:05:29,740 --> 03:05:32,160
So these are all just like little houses and stuff.

3851
03:05:32,440 --> 03:05:34,200
This one was under the water too though.

3852
03:05:37,320 --> 03:05:38,700
They found the eye directly.

3853
03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:40,080
Oh, my skill issue.

3854
03:05:41,760 --> 03:05:43,560
It's so funny because the...

3855
03:05:44,660 --> 03:05:45,180
Oh.

3856
03:05:49,180 --> 03:05:49,700
Interesting.

3857
03:05:49,740 --> 03:05:50,000
Okay.

3858
03:05:50,040 --> 03:05:50,440
This...

3859
03:05:50,440 --> 03:05:51,020
The eye...

3860
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:51,080
The eye...

3861
03:05:51,080 --> 03:05:53,480
Is missing part of his antlers.

3862
03:05:56,240 --> 03:05:58,800
But it's funny because the Nomai were just like...

3863
03:05:58,800 --> 03:05:59,440
Yo.

3864
03:05:59,920 --> 03:06:01,500
Our guy is like...

3865
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:02,640
What is this?

3866
03:06:05,160 --> 03:06:06,000
Our guy...

3867
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:06,400
Like the...

3868
03:06:06,400 --> 03:06:07,000
We...

3869
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:07,680
Oh, I'm scared.

3870
03:06:10,020 --> 03:06:10,440
Oh.

3871
03:06:14,800 --> 03:06:15,580
What is this?

3872
03:06:15,720 --> 03:06:16,140
Hold on.

3873
03:06:16,160 --> 03:06:16,360
Sorry.

3874
03:06:16,460 --> 03:06:19,640
I'm trying to talk and then I'm like discovering stuff all at the same time.

3875
03:06:21,100 --> 03:06:21,520
Interesting.

3876
03:06:23,500 --> 03:06:24,100
My cat says...

3877
03:06:24,100 --> 03:06:24,720
Good morning, Minto.

3878
03:06:24,820 --> 03:06:25,780
Good morning, Kato.

3879
03:06:33,180 --> 03:06:34,460
What building is that?

3880
03:06:35,500 --> 03:06:36,900
And it leads into a cave.

3881
03:06:37,620 --> 03:06:37,920
Okay.

3882
03:06:38,460 --> 03:06:38,900
Yeah.

3883
03:06:38,940 --> 03:06:39,640
Like a hidden room.

3884
03:06:43,620 --> 03:06:44,500
But yeah.

3885
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:46,160
The Nomai were just like...

3886
03:06:46,160 --> 03:06:47,720
It's calling to us.

3887
03:06:47,880 --> 03:06:48,500
But like...

3888
03:06:48,500 --> 03:06:50,620
I think the eye was actually calling to these guys.

3889
03:06:51,520 --> 03:06:51,960
Oh.

3890
03:06:51,980 --> 03:06:52,800
This one right here maybe.

3891
03:06:53,040 --> 03:06:53,480
Oh.

3892
03:06:54,800 --> 03:06:55,300
Oh.

3893
03:06:55,380 --> 03:06:57,840
That might be how I get inside to the...

3894
03:06:59,320 --> 03:07:00,320
To the...

3895
03:07:01,800 --> 03:07:02,660
What's the word?

3896
03:07:03,800 --> 03:07:04,780
Not the elevator.

3897
03:07:05,060 --> 03:07:06,180
That's not the correct word.

3898
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:07,460
The staircase.

3899
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:10,700
Right?

3900
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:11,180
Oh.

3901
03:07:11,220 --> 03:07:11,660
There it is.

3902
03:07:11,700 --> 03:07:12,120
There it is.

3903
03:07:12,120 --> 03:07:12,460
There it is.

3904
03:07:12,540 --> 03:07:12,740
Okay.

3905
03:07:16,400 --> 03:07:16,900
Okay.

3906
03:07:22,610 --> 03:07:23,450
This way.

3907
03:07:24,270 --> 03:07:24,770
Over.

3908
03:07:24,890 --> 03:07:25,390
Over.

3909
03:07:26,010 --> 03:07:26,510
Over.

3910
03:07:26,750 --> 03:07:27,250
Inside.

3911
03:07:27,410 --> 03:07:27,730
This way.

3912
03:07:27,750 --> 03:07:28,690
Inside.

3913
03:07:29,950 --> 03:07:30,470
Inside.

3914
03:07:31,350 --> 03:07:31,870
Inside.

3915
03:07:32,710 --> 03:07:33,230
Oh.

3916
03:07:33,390 --> 03:07:34,430
It's really scary in here.

3917
03:07:34,610 --> 03:07:34,750
Oh.

3918
03:07:34,910 --> 03:07:35,730
I don't like this.

3919
03:07:36,170 --> 03:07:36,690
Oh.

3920
03:07:36,870 --> 03:07:37,850
It's really dark.

3921
03:07:38,310 --> 03:07:38,830
Oh.

3922
03:07:39,130 --> 03:07:39,650
Goodness.

3923
03:07:40,650 --> 03:07:41,170
Okay.

3924
03:07:47,210 --> 03:07:48,890
To the cave we go.

3925
03:07:50,870 --> 03:07:51,990
We learn about it.

3926
03:07:52,090 --> 03:07:53,030
We go...

3927
03:07:54,590 --> 03:07:55,490
Search it out.

3928
03:07:57,130 --> 03:07:57,650
Oh.

3929
03:07:57,730 --> 03:07:58,150
I was right.

3930
03:07:58,190 --> 03:07:58,770
It is the staircase.

3931
03:07:59,390 --> 03:07:59,910
Okay.

3932
03:08:01,680 --> 03:08:02,200
Okay.

3933
03:08:03,940 --> 03:08:05,460
I like that.

3934
03:08:06,480 --> 03:08:11,660
But sometimes I, I like it a little bit.

3935
03:08:11,660 --> 03:08:12,160
We found another treasure.

3936
03:08:13,080 --> 03:08:14,080
Do this.

3937
03:08:16,760 --> 03:08:17,480
Oh.

3938
03:08:18,200 --> 03:08:19,200
Yeah.

3939
03:08:19,460 --> 03:08:19,660
Ah.

3940
03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:21,260
Not here.

3941
03:08:21,260 --> 03:08:21,760
There's no exit here?

3942
03:08:28,520 --> 03:08:30,080
I think I found something.

3943
03:08:30,580 --> 03:08:31,580
Okay.

3944
03:08:31,580 --> 03:08:31,620
Yep.

3945
03:08:32,940 --> 03:08:33,440
Okay.

3946
03:08:33,940 --> 03:08:34,180
Okay.

3947
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:34,720
Alright.

3948
03:08:37,720 --> 03:08:38,760
Thank you!

3949
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:40,360
Welcome back for two mines!

3950
03:08:40,500 --> 03:08:41,120
Thank you so much.

3951
03:08:43,080 --> 03:08:45,640
So I'll read a book...

3952
03:08:56,970 --> 03:08:58,130
Let's see, what is this?

3953
03:08:58,330 --> 03:08:59,310
What is this doing?

3954
03:09:00,430 --> 03:09:00,950
Powering...

3955
03:09:02,530 --> 03:09:05,130
To the house, to the tower...

3956
03:09:06,630 --> 03:09:08,850
To the hidden hobbit home...

3957
03:09:09,930 --> 03:09:12,190
To the grand bell...

3958
03:09:15,990 --> 03:09:17,350
It's a good thing I'm up here!

3959
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:24,840
My boat...

3960
03:09:25,760 --> 03:09:28,040
I need to get down there though, right?

3961
03:09:33,990 --> 03:09:37,450
We have to get down there and then we have to do the lantern thing all over again.

3962
03:09:37,650 --> 03:09:38,850
Yeah, I need to find a working projector.

3963
03:09:39,030 --> 03:09:39,690
There's one in there!

3964
03:09:44,610 --> 03:09:45,230
Oh!

3965
03:09:45,270 --> 03:09:50,370
Oh my gosh, we're watching it fall apart in real time.

3966
03:09:53,130 --> 03:09:54,590
Oh, it's fine.

3967
03:09:56,270 --> 03:09:58,750
It all okay, baby.

3968
03:10:02,050 --> 03:10:02,670
Okay.

3969
03:10:03,870 --> 03:10:07,110
Barely a scratch, tis but a flesh wound.

3970
03:10:08,240 --> 03:10:08,550
Right?

3971
03:10:11,070 --> 03:10:12,530
Okay, insert that.

3972
03:10:13,370 --> 03:10:17,790
And let's go find a working lantern, which we know where to get one.

3973
03:10:18,650 --> 03:10:19,630
More lugs!

3974
03:10:21,370 --> 03:10:21,930
Toki!

3975
03:10:23,950 --> 03:10:25,050
Do a flip.

3976
03:10:28,390 --> 03:10:32,490
Toki, you make jokes but you'd be too baby to play this game, I know it.

3977
03:10:33,390 --> 03:10:35,990
Your bird brain wouldn't even be able to figure stuff out.

3978
03:10:41,660 --> 03:10:43,880
We're gonna be playing this...

3979
03:10:44,880 --> 03:10:51,920
I looked up the game we're playing on Friday and it looks so...

3980
03:10:53,020 --> 03:10:55,240
It looks very...

3981
03:10:55,240 --> 03:10:58,880
I can't wait for Kusoge.

3982
03:10:59,580 --> 03:11:01,600
Alright, let's look at whatever the hell this thing is.

3983
03:11:03,280 --> 03:11:03,720
Ooh!

3984
03:11:05,920 --> 03:11:06,360
Oh!

3985
03:11:06,980 --> 03:11:08,100
Oh, it's that symbol.

3986
03:11:08,300 --> 03:11:08,620
Okay.

3987
03:11:10,780 --> 03:11:11,900
Toki bird coded?

3988
03:11:12,280 --> 03:11:12,720
Maybe.

3989
03:11:14,540 --> 03:11:16,400
Wait, let me mod you real quick.

3990
03:11:18,060 --> 03:11:21,540
Sorry, every time I click out of the game, that's what chat is for.

3991
03:11:23,620 --> 03:11:24,760
I almost clicked hide.

3992
03:11:24,940 --> 03:11:26,380
Hide user on this channel.

3993
03:11:31,100 --> 03:11:31,760
There we go.

3994
03:11:35,920 --> 03:11:36,640
Okay.

3995
03:11:37,340 --> 03:11:38,060
He's looking.

3996
03:11:38,700 --> 03:11:39,780
He's walking.

3997
03:11:39,940 --> 03:11:40,960
Who's taking these photos?

3998
03:11:41,660 --> 03:11:43,020
They're so atmospheric.

3999
03:11:43,200 --> 03:11:44,180
These guys are so dramatic.

4000
03:11:44,580 --> 03:11:44,900
Ooh!

4001
03:11:45,020 --> 03:11:46,000
He's looking at the camera.

4002
03:11:46,380 --> 03:11:46,780
Ah!

4003
03:11:48,520 --> 03:11:49,520
Is that you?

4004
03:11:50,300 --> 03:11:50,940
Oh!

4005
03:11:51,820 --> 03:11:52,980
Is that you?

4006
03:11:53,580 --> 03:11:54,520
It's me!

4007
03:11:55,440 --> 03:11:56,680
Me asking.

4008
03:11:57,720 --> 03:11:58,440
You?

4009
03:12:00,420 --> 03:12:00,780
You?

4010
03:12:05,600 --> 03:12:06,320
Cool.

4011
03:12:12,350 --> 03:12:12,710
What?

4012
03:12:15,210 --> 03:12:17,110
If you remove the light...

4013
03:12:17,110 --> 03:12:17,850
Wait, which one was it?

4014
03:12:19,950 --> 03:12:22,490
Okay, it's the one where he's staring at Saturn.

4015
03:12:23,230 --> 03:12:24,190
Secret title!

4016
03:12:28,730 --> 03:12:30,450
This is not a cult, right?

4017
03:12:31,850 --> 03:12:33,870
This is not a cult, right?

4018
03:12:34,390 --> 03:12:35,230
Meep, welcome back.

4019
03:12:35,250 --> 03:12:35,650
Thank you.

4020
03:12:35,830 --> 03:12:37,210
Meep has been called for work.

4021
03:12:37,350 --> 03:12:38,590
Me shall see the body.

4022
03:12:38,930 --> 03:12:39,970
Good luck with work!

4023
03:12:48,440 --> 03:12:49,620
It's all of them.

4024
03:12:49,740 --> 03:12:51,600
It's anything with this symbol.

4025
03:12:51,900 --> 03:12:54,240
Has a secret passage.

4026
03:12:54,580 --> 03:12:57,880
I like the footage of all the...

4027
03:13:01,460 --> 03:13:02,060
Okay.

4028
03:13:05,180 --> 03:13:06,080
Very cool.

4029
03:13:06,460 --> 03:13:07,660
I liked that one.

4030
03:13:07,900 --> 03:13:09,980
That was a cool, that was a cool...

4031
03:13:12,200 --> 03:13:12,680
Discovery.

4032
03:13:12,880 --> 03:13:16,540
Wait, so we can go... do it here then, right?

4033
03:13:17,440 --> 03:13:18,240
I'd join.

4034
03:13:24,150 --> 03:13:25,970
There is no Saturn!

4035
03:13:28,210 --> 03:13:28,690
Interesting.

4036
03:13:29,070 --> 03:13:30,530
So it's not this one.

4037
03:13:32,790 --> 03:13:34,390
Maybe it's the one from up the river.

4038
03:13:40,250 --> 03:13:41,270
There was?

4039
03:13:41,670 --> 03:13:42,910
No, there wasn't!

4040
03:13:46,050 --> 03:13:48,670
Unless you mean... this one.

4041
03:13:49,410 --> 03:13:51,090
But it's not the same picture.

4042
03:14:28,220 --> 03:14:29,620
I'm just gonna...

4043
03:14:33,880 --> 03:14:35,060
Don't mind me.

4044
03:14:36,040 --> 03:14:37,080
Oh shoot.

4045
03:14:50,940 --> 03:14:52,620
Come on.

4046
03:14:52,760 --> 03:14:54,440
Toast it to perfection!

4047
03:14:54,860 --> 03:14:55,580
Yes!

4048
03:14:58,280 --> 03:14:59,120
Anyway...

4049
03:15:04,840 --> 03:15:07,800
These guys are so huge.

4050
03:15:08,140 --> 03:15:10,340
This guy is knocked the hell out!

4051
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:12,880
I want what he had.

4052
03:15:15,600 --> 03:15:17,340
He's just like...

4053
03:15:20,900 --> 03:15:22,380
This guy too!

4054
03:15:24,420 --> 03:15:27,740
He took one too many melatonin.

4055
03:15:31,780 --> 03:15:33,140
Don't touch the fire.

4056
03:15:33,340 --> 03:15:33,540
I guess.

4057
03:15:35,480 --> 03:15:36,280
My bad.

4058
03:15:37,320 --> 03:15:38,920
Well, this is a little freaky.

4059
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:41,700
I guess this answers the question where they went.

4060
03:15:41,880 --> 03:15:44,620
But there's one missing and I don't like that very much!

4061
03:15:45,800 --> 03:15:47,900
I don't like that very much.

4062
03:15:50,320 --> 03:15:53,680
I cannot believe that I can roast marshmallows in the...

4063
03:15:54,260 --> 03:15:55,960
In the ghost matter fire.

4064
03:15:59,760 --> 03:16:00,200
Okay.

4065
03:16:02,040 --> 03:16:02,900
This one's...

4066
03:16:02,900 --> 03:16:03,580
No.

4067
03:16:03,700 --> 03:16:05,140
Oh, I thought it was not lit.

4068
03:16:05,200 --> 03:16:05,740
But it's...

4069
03:16:05,740 --> 03:16:06,520
It's litty.

4070
03:16:08,220 --> 03:16:08,660
Wait.

4071
03:16:09,400 --> 03:16:10,380
Did this guy move?

4072
03:16:10,760 --> 03:16:11,180
Or was...

4073
03:16:11,180 --> 03:16:12,880
He always kind of slouched over.

4074
03:16:13,500 --> 03:16:14,560
I sure hope not.

4075
03:16:16,400 --> 03:16:16,840
Okay.

4076
03:16:17,600 --> 03:16:18,680
Room for one more.

4077
03:16:18,820 --> 03:16:19,420
I'm into...

4078
03:16:20,140 --> 03:16:20,580
Okay.

4079
03:16:24,780 --> 03:16:26,460
This is not a cold...

4080
03:16:26,460 --> 03:16:26,860
Oh god!

4081
03:16:26,960 --> 03:16:27,760
Where's the entrance?

4082
03:16:27,820 --> 03:16:27,980
Oh!

4083
03:16:27,980 --> 03:16:28,060
Yes!

4084
03:16:28,060 --> 03:16:28,420
There we go!

4085
03:16:32,940 --> 03:16:35,040
It sure doesn't seem like a cold.

4086
03:16:36,400 --> 03:16:37,200
Not at all.

4087
03:16:43,660 --> 03:16:44,100
Okay.

4088
03:16:44,120 --> 03:16:44,560
Okay.

4089
03:16:45,440 --> 03:16:47,180
Let's go to this boat over here.

4090
03:16:47,320 --> 03:16:49,260
Maybe we can even continue a little bit onward.

4091
03:16:50,840 --> 03:16:52,240
We'll have to swim for a bit.

4092
03:16:53,740 --> 03:16:54,180
Okay.

4093
03:16:54,220 --> 03:16:54,600
Nice.

4094
03:16:57,140 --> 03:16:58,440
And up.

4095
03:16:58,500 --> 03:16:59,460
Not a cold.

4096
03:17:00,100 --> 03:17:01,400
Not a cold.

4097
03:17:01,500 --> 03:17:02,800
Not a cold.

4098
03:17:03,220 --> 03:17:03,900
Okay.

4099
03:17:04,600 --> 03:17:05,440
This way.

4100
03:17:06,540 --> 03:17:07,220
Okay.

4101
03:17:07,260 --> 03:17:09,360
This is the furthest we've been now.

4102
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:14,340
Not a cold.

4103
03:17:14,600 --> 03:17:16,100
Not a cold.

4104
03:17:16,240 --> 03:17:17,720
Not a cold.

4105
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:19,420
Not a cold.

4106
03:17:20,800 --> 03:17:22,720
It sounds like I'm saying nautical.

4107
03:17:22,920 --> 03:17:23,480
Oh!

4108
03:17:23,520 --> 03:17:23,860
Oh!

4109
03:17:23,900 --> 03:17:24,580
Oh!

4110
03:17:24,600 --> 03:17:25,780
That doesn't seem...

4111
03:17:25,780 --> 03:17:25,940
Okay.

4112
03:17:26,100 --> 03:17:26,420
Oh!

4113
03:17:26,580 --> 03:17:26,920
Oh!

4114
03:17:27,040 --> 03:17:28,560
Don't fall in the water here.

4115
03:17:29,580 --> 03:17:30,140
Okay.

4116
03:17:30,200 --> 03:17:30,820
Good to know.

4117
03:17:33,360 --> 03:17:36,600
Don't fall in the water there or else you're nautical.

4118
03:17:39,080 --> 03:17:39,640
Nautical.

4119
03:17:43,470 --> 03:17:45,430
This area looks a little gnarly.

4120
03:17:48,130 --> 03:17:49,010
What's over here?

4121
03:17:50,910 --> 03:17:51,990
Ship log update.

4122
03:17:52,170 --> 03:17:52,910
With what?

4123
03:17:59,830 --> 03:18:00,390
Over...

4124
03:18:00,390 --> 03:18:00,770
Oh!

4125
03:18:00,790 --> 03:18:01,370
Here.

4126
03:18:01,570 --> 03:18:02,410
This way.

4127
03:18:03,670 --> 03:18:04,450
This way.

4128
03:18:06,750 --> 03:18:08,090
I like the music.

4129
03:18:08,930 --> 03:18:13,490
It plays like such whimsical music every time I'm going around.

4130
03:18:13,830 --> 03:18:14,030
Oh!

4131
03:18:14,070 --> 03:18:15,030
Is there nothing here?

4132
03:18:16,350 --> 03:18:17,290
Wait a second.

4133
03:18:18,410 --> 03:18:19,830
There's a secret cave!

4134
03:18:22,450 --> 03:18:23,090
Right...

4135
03:18:23,090 --> 03:18:24,010
Right there.

4136
03:18:27,950 --> 03:18:28,590
Oh.

4137
03:18:28,670 --> 03:18:28,970
Well.

4138
03:18:29,390 --> 03:18:30,690
It's our time anyway.

4139
03:18:30,690 --> 03:18:30,770
Okay.

4140
03:18:30,790 --> 03:18:30,970
Alright.

4141
03:18:30,970 --> 03:18:31,490
I'll bet you guys...

4142
03:18:32,910 --> 03:18:34,650
And there goes our boat.

4143
03:18:35,650 --> 03:18:36,990
It's our time anyway.

4144
03:18:42,350 --> 03:18:43,450
Next to the egg.

4145
03:18:44,110 --> 03:18:46,290
I swear I saw something there.

4146
03:18:46,850 --> 03:18:49,190
I know I saw something there.

4147
03:18:49,410 --> 03:18:51,310
It was like morbing and then it...

4148
03:18:51,310 --> 03:18:52,250
It went...

4149
03:18:52,830 --> 03:18:53,570
Out of existence!

4150
03:18:56,130 --> 03:18:57,330
I saw it.

4151
03:18:57,350 --> 03:18:58,010
I saw it.

4152
03:18:58,030 --> 03:18:58,750
I saw it.

4153
03:19:00,210 --> 03:19:01,730
Oh, I wanna go up there.

4154
03:19:02,170 --> 03:19:03,090
I wanna go up here.

4155
03:19:03,090 --> 03:19:03,190
I wanna go up.

4156
03:19:03,190 --> 03:19:03,310
Where am I?

4157
03:19:03,310 --> 03:19:03,330
Where am I?

4158
03:19:04,290 --> 03:19:05,010
Can we?

4159
03:19:06,490 --> 03:19:07,010
Ow!

4160
03:19:07,350 --> 03:19:08,150
So close.

4161
03:19:12,530 --> 03:19:13,350
Not quite.

4162
03:19:21,780 --> 03:19:23,380
It's really trippy to look at.

4163
03:19:23,720 --> 03:19:27,060
It seems like it's much bigger too than it actually is, I guess.

4164
03:19:27,320 --> 03:19:29,140
Because it's just a loop, right?

4165
03:19:29,760 --> 03:19:30,780
Is there a floor?

4166
03:19:38,950 --> 03:19:42,210
We'll just ride down the lazy river until we die.

4167
03:19:43,250 --> 03:19:43,770
Wow!

4168
03:19:44,130 --> 03:19:44,350
Oh!

4169
03:19:44,810 --> 03:19:45,330
Ouch!

4170
03:19:49,150 --> 03:19:50,950
I'm surprised I lived.

4171
03:19:52,250 --> 03:19:53,710
I lived just to die.

4172
03:19:54,830 --> 03:19:55,850
Can we go this way?

4173
03:19:56,810 --> 03:19:58,130
I still want to explore.

4174
03:19:58,350 --> 03:19:58,810
Come on, game!

4175
03:20:21,310 --> 03:20:21,950
I'm trapped.

4176
03:20:22,190 --> 03:20:22,490
Wait!

4177
03:20:22,630 --> 03:20:24,210
Didn't I go to this house in the very beginning?

4178
03:20:29,450 --> 03:20:29,890
Oh!

4179
03:20:37,120 --> 03:20:38,200
You have boost.

4180
03:20:38,460 --> 03:20:38,840
It's OK.

4181
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:39,640
I was dying anyway.

4182
03:20:47,410 --> 03:20:49,090
I was living on borrowed time.

4183
03:20:55,900 --> 03:20:57,700
We did a lot that time though.

4184
03:20:58,840 --> 03:20:59,940
We did a whole lot.

4185
03:21:00,660 --> 03:21:01,360
Look at that!

4186
03:21:01,380 --> 03:21:02,960
That was a really full...

4187
03:21:02,960 --> 03:21:04,880
That was a super full trip.

4188
03:21:06,940 --> 03:21:08,160
Who knows now?

4189
03:21:08,680 --> 03:21:10,280
Who knows now?

4190
03:21:12,220 --> 03:21:12,820
OK.

4191
03:21:13,040 --> 03:21:13,740
Let's see.

4192
03:21:15,280 --> 03:21:17,160
We'll do a few more loops though.

4193
03:21:17,280 --> 03:21:19,160
Because I'm still very curious as to...

4194
03:21:19,880 --> 03:21:21,760
what else we got going on in here.

4195
03:21:22,140 --> 03:21:22,320
Ooh!

4196
03:21:22,920 --> 03:21:23,520
Wow!

4197
03:21:24,300 --> 03:21:24,900
OK.

4198
03:21:28,160 --> 03:21:31,760
An enormous reservoir with wooden piers and buildings on both shores.

4199
03:21:32,570 --> 03:21:33,780
There's more to explore here.

4200
03:21:35,940 --> 03:21:36,520
Oh!

4201
03:21:44,040 --> 03:21:46,240
Who is naming this place, huh?

4202
03:21:46,340 --> 03:21:48,420
Are we just coming up with our own names?

4203
03:21:48,940 --> 03:21:51,040
We can't even read the language!

4204
03:21:53,620 --> 03:21:57,320
Slide reel that shows the origins of the stranger and its inhabitants.

4205
03:21:57,700 --> 03:22:00,100
Several slides have been burned and cannot be viewed.

4206
03:22:00,100 --> 03:22:01,500
Source me.

4207
03:22:03,280 --> 03:22:06,720
A tower that sits atop one of the cinder aisles.

4208
03:22:08,220 --> 03:22:13,800
The upper floors can only be reached from a second entrance at the back of the tower.

4209
03:22:16,280 --> 03:22:17,920
I found a slide reel.

4210
03:22:18,120 --> 03:22:20,140
I don't know why I cannot say slide reel.

4211
03:22:20,280 --> 03:22:26,180
That shows the stranger's inhabitants opening a secret passage in a round room filled with lanterns and murals.

4212
03:22:26,340 --> 03:22:30,080
The inhabitants are shown filing into three of these rooms throughout the room.

4213
03:22:30,080 --> 03:22:30,420
What does this mean about the stranger?

4214
03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:39,880
We'll call them cinder aisles and island tower and actual names, but the ship itself is just the stranger.

4215
03:22:42,700 --> 03:22:46,220
You can talk to the guy at the museum about the language, but it doesn't change anything in the game.

4216
03:22:46,340 --> 03:22:46,440
Oh!

4217
03:22:46,800 --> 03:22:47,940
I kind of want to ask, though.

4218
03:22:48,200 --> 03:22:49,320
I want to know what he says.

4219
03:22:50,680 --> 03:22:53,520
A pair of small rocky islands connected by a village of stilt houses.

4220
03:22:53,620 --> 03:22:59,500
I found a large metal symbol for the eye of the universe inside a burned-out building.

4221
03:23:00,260 --> 03:23:01,300
Yes, we did.

4222
03:23:01,880 --> 03:23:03,240
Yes, indeed, we did.

4223
03:23:13,910 --> 03:23:14,590
Oh, wait.

4224
03:23:14,770 --> 03:23:15,990
Well, it's fine.

4225
03:23:18,090 --> 03:23:19,250
Come on, stranger.

4226
03:23:19,510 --> 03:23:20,350
I'm coming for you.

4227
03:23:22,010 --> 03:23:23,770
I'm on my way.

4228
03:23:25,630 --> 03:23:26,150
Autopilot.

4229
03:23:28,410 --> 03:23:28,930
Oh.

4230
03:23:30,570 --> 03:23:31,610
Oh, there we go.

4231
03:23:35,890 --> 03:23:37,190
I'm coming for you.

4232
03:23:38,230 --> 03:23:38,790
Stranger?

4233
03:23:40,010 --> 03:23:40,770
Howdy, stranger.

4234
03:23:40,870 --> 03:23:41,970
Don't be a stranger now.

4235
03:23:42,910 --> 03:23:43,670
Oh, gosh.

4236
03:23:43,830 --> 03:23:50,030
Oh, down.

4237
03:23:54,450 --> 03:23:55,290
It's forward.

4238
03:23:55,490 --> 03:23:56,350
Forward march.

4239
03:23:56,550 --> 03:23:57,410
Forward march.

4240
03:23:59,790 --> 03:24:00,910
Forward march.

4241
03:24:00,990 --> 03:24:01,310
Down.

4242
03:24:03,430 --> 03:24:03,990
And...

4243
03:24:04,910 --> 03:24:06,170
A perfect landing.

4244
03:24:09,550 --> 03:24:10,370
You good?

4245
03:24:10,650 --> 03:24:10,890
Oh!

4246
03:24:13,150 --> 03:24:14,150
Am I sideways?

4247
03:24:15,150 --> 03:24:16,550
How would I do that?

4248
03:24:20,850 --> 03:24:22,670
How would I do that?

4249
03:24:28,080 --> 03:24:28,760
Dang it.

4250
03:24:31,280 --> 03:24:31,860
Awesome.

4251
03:24:32,660 --> 03:24:33,700
Like a glove.

4252
03:24:35,060 --> 03:24:36,480
Like a glove.

4253
03:24:38,280 --> 03:24:39,820
So why does this thing...

4254
03:24:43,060 --> 03:24:44,320
I have to wonder.

4255
03:24:44,540 --> 03:24:45,240
Oh, shoot.

4256
03:24:45,340 --> 03:24:46,460
I forgot that we have to push it.

4257
03:24:47,460 --> 03:24:49,760
Why does this thing blow up anyway?

4258
03:24:50,520 --> 03:24:51,280
This dam.

4259
03:24:52,480 --> 03:24:53,800
Why does it blow up anyway?

4260
03:24:53,860 --> 03:24:58,720
Also, I noticed some stairs over here, which I am quite curious about.

4261
03:24:59,400 --> 03:24:59,880
Look.

4262
03:25:00,760 --> 03:25:02,460
The music didn't even have a chance.

4263
03:25:03,200 --> 03:25:03,680
There we go.

4264
03:25:06,160 --> 03:25:06,860
Take a look.

4265
03:25:06,980 --> 03:25:07,620
Oh, I will.

4266
03:25:07,940 --> 03:25:09,680
I will be taking a look.

4267
03:25:13,560 --> 03:25:15,280
Damn if you do, damn if you don't.

4268
03:25:18,220 --> 03:25:21,100
This is the house I was just trying to get to before!

4269
03:25:24,520 --> 03:25:25,320
No way.

4270
03:25:25,860 --> 03:25:26,900
Oh goodness.

4271
03:25:27,420 --> 03:25:28,280
Okay, that's a boat.

4272
03:25:29,380 --> 03:25:30,760
Why is it so dark in here?

4273
03:25:31,200 --> 03:25:32,360
Why is it so scary?

4274
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:35,700
What's this?

4275
03:25:35,960 --> 03:25:36,540
Rotate.

4276
03:25:49,990 --> 03:25:52,250
Why is everything got to be so dramatic?

4277
03:25:54,490 --> 03:25:55,130
What the?

4278
03:25:56,910 --> 03:25:57,490
Oh!

4279
03:25:57,690 --> 03:25:59,350
It's just another...

4280
03:26:01,370 --> 03:26:02,870
It's just another entrance.

4281
03:26:03,270 --> 03:26:04,250
Are you kidding me?

4282
03:26:14,430 --> 03:26:15,530
Another ship bay.

4283
03:26:15,690 --> 03:26:16,110
Yeah.

4284
03:26:19,050 --> 03:26:21,050
And it would have led me down this way instead.

4285
03:26:21,550 --> 03:26:21,690
Ah!

4286
03:26:22,870 --> 03:26:24,490
Interesting, interesting, interesting.

4287
03:26:26,470 --> 03:26:27,030
Okay.

4288
03:26:27,310 --> 03:26:29,430
Well, fire exit.

4289
03:26:29,810 --> 03:26:30,710
Now we know.

4290
03:26:31,670 --> 03:26:32,570
Now we know.

4291
03:26:40,060 --> 03:26:41,340
That's how you first come in.

4292
03:26:42,580 --> 03:26:43,340
Oh, wait.

4293
03:26:45,820 --> 03:26:46,980
Oh, oh, whoop.

4294
03:26:50,400 --> 03:26:53,260
And push the raft, push the raft, push the raft.

4295
03:26:53,800 --> 03:26:54,580
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

4296
03:26:55,540 --> 03:26:56,200
Don't leave!

4297
03:26:58,540 --> 03:27:00,020
I'm searching for an egg.

4298
03:27:02,720 --> 03:27:03,680
I swear.

4299
03:27:04,040 --> 03:27:04,920
I swear.

4300
03:27:05,580 --> 03:27:06,440
It was here.

4301
03:27:08,240 --> 03:27:09,560
I swear it!

4302
03:27:09,560 --> 03:27:10,440
I swear it!

4303
03:27:10,780 --> 03:27:12,780
We still have to find a way to get inside there.

4304
03:27:15,320 --> 03:27:15,800
Oops.

4305
03:27:16,980 --> 03:27:17,320
I pushed a little.

4306
03:27:21,330 --> 03:27:21,850
Okay.

4307
03:27:21,910 --> 03:27:24,450
What was another place that had...

4308
03:27:25,690 --> 03:27:26,670
Not in there.

4309
03:27:27,150 --> 03:27:27,670
Here.

4310
03:27:28,470 --> 03:27:30,730
This place also had...

4311
03:27:30,730 --> 03:27:33,950
The... what's it called?

4312
03:27:37,560 --> 03:27:38,960
The lantern and stuff.

4313
03:27:41,400 --> 03:27:43,060
Jeffrey, is the egg real?

4314
03:27:45,080 --> 03:27:46,380
Don't do this to me.

4315
03:27:46,700 --> 03:27:47,660
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4316
03:27:47,800 --> 03:27:49,440
This is the initial one that we saw.

4317
03:27:53,300 --> 03:27:54,000
Drop it.

4318
03:27:56,060 --> 03:27:56,580
Wow.

4319
03:27:56,580 --> 03:27:57,380
So cool.

4320
03:27:57,840 --> 03:27:58,360
Okay.

4321
03:27:58,800 --> 03:27:59,600
Here we go.

4322
03:27:59,780 --> 03:28:01,800
I hope there's no more dead bodies down here.

4323
03:28:04,360 --> 03:28:06,300
Or else I'm really going to think this is a coal.

4324
03:28:06,560 --> 03:28:07,060
Oh, no!

4325
03:28:07,840 --> 03:28:13,180
I'm really, really, really starting to believe that this is a coal.

4326
03:28:17,140 --> 03:28:20,640
I'm really having some suspicions.

4327
03:28:23,780 --> 03:28:24,940
This one sounds different.

4328
03:28:25,080 --> 03:28:26,860
But also, all the guys are here.

4329
03:28:28,560 --> 03:28:31,440
So only at that other one was it missing somebody.

4330
03:28:32,720 --> 03:28:33,720
Totally not a coal.

4331
03:28:34,060 --> 03:28:34,400
Okay.

4332
03:28:34,820 --> 03:28:35,720
Let's get out of here.

4333
03:28:39,500 --> 03:28:40,720
How do you think they taste?

4334
03:28:40,800 --> 03:28:42,400
They look like they would taste like chicken feet.

4335
03:28:43,180 --> 03:28:44,600
Which I've never tried before.

4336
03:28:44,880 --> 03:28:46,220
So you'll have to ask Matara.

4337
03:28:48,520 --> 03:28:48,960
I'm like...

4338
03:28:50,080 --> 03:28:54,540
I'm like struggling to remember where I've gone.

4339
03:28:56,140 --> 03:28:56,700
Oh, wait.

4340
03:28:56,800 --> 03:28:59,080
I wish I could push the raft outside the raft.

4341
03:29:06,060 --> 03:29:07,580
So we're just going to continue onward.

4342
03:29:09,300 --> 03:29:11,000
Chicken feet are good when marinated well.

4343
03:29:12,040 --> 03:29:13,520
She, like, lives by it.

4344
03:29:13,620 --> 03:29:15,200
She's just like, chicken feet are so delicious.

4345
03:29:15,400 --> 03:29:16,020
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

4346
03:29:23,890 --> 03:29:25,190
We went all through there.

4347
03:29:25,330 --> 03:29:26,210
So let's just keep going.

4348
03:29:29,090 --> 03:29:31,070
I haven't had chicken feet I like.

4349
03:29:31,570 --> 03:29:32,470
I think...

4350
03:29:36,570 --> 03:29:38,030
Why does it get like that here?

4351
03:29:38,270 --> 03:29:39,390
I did it before also.

4352
03:29:41,890 --> 03:29:43,630
I love the music on the raft.

4353
03:29:43,730 --> 03:29:44,450
It's so cool.

4354
03:29:47,330 --> 03:29:49,370
So these are the electric wires.

4355
03:29:57,410 --> 03:29:58,530
Have I gone...

4356
03:29:58,530 --> 03:29:59,290
Let's go over here.

4357
03:29:59,770 --> 03:30:02,010
I haven't really gone over this way before.

4358
03:30:03,190 --> 03:30:03,670
So...

4359
03:30:05,210 --> 03:30:06,750
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4360
03:30:07,270 --> 03:30:07,910
Please.

4361
03:30:08,450 --> 03:30:09,350
Is it too strong?

4362
03:30:09,410 --> 03:30:09,850
The current?

4363
03:30:10,470 --> 03:30:11,110
Uh...

4364
03:30:11,430 --> 03:30:11,750
No.

4365
03:30:12,290 --> 03:30:13,130
Oh, well.

4366
03:30:22,850 --> 03:30:23,570
It's okay.

4367
03:30:23,670 --> 03:30:24,070
We're exploring.

4368
03:30:24,870 --> 03:30:25,510
Yeah.

4369
03:30:25,610 --> 03:30:26,630
Today's your birthday.

4370
03:30:27,510 --> 03:30:28,470
Happy birthday.

4371
03:30:31,110 --> 03:30:34,850
Happy birthday to you.

4372
03:30:36,330 --> 03:30:38,950
Happy birthday to you.

4373
03:30:40,290 --> 03:30:41,570
Happy birthday.

4374
03:30:41,570 --> 03:30:42,390
Dear.

4375
03:30:42,830 --> 03:30:43,250
Yeah.

4376
03:30:45,010 --> 03:30:48,190
Happy birthday to you.

4377
03:30:50,910 --> 03:30:51,790
Happy birthday.

4378
03:30:53,570 --> 03:30:56,410
I hope you guys don't mind me not clapping like I usually do.

4379
03:30:56,610 --> 03:31:00,550
But like I said, I'm on a bit of a time limit with this game.

4380
03:31:00,770 --> 03:31:03,610
So I've got to move as fast as I can.

4381
03:31:03,770 --> 03:31:04,470
Oh, another puzzle.

4382
03:31:09,660 --> 03:31:10,100
Oh.

4383
03:31:11,420 --> 03:31:12,120
Oh, no.

4384
03:31:12,840 --> 03:31:13,280
Okay.

4385
03:31:13,380 --> 03:31:13,880
We'll come back.

4386
03:31:13,880 --> 03:31:14,200
We'll come back to that.

4387
03:31:14,380 --> 03:31:15,080
I don't think...

4388
03:31:15,080 --> 03:31:18,480
I might have the stuff for that, but I'm not quite sure.

4389
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:20,920
The knowledge.

4390
03:31:23,900 --> 03:31:26,140
Not quite sure if I have the knowledge yet.

4391
03:31:26,240 --> 03:31:29,680
But there was another building over here, so...

4392
03:31:30,980 --> 03:31:31,440
Okay.

4393
03:31:34,640 --> 03:31:35,560
Clap now.

4394
03:31:39,500 --> 03:31:40,980
Andrey goes, thanks for the 10 gifted.

4395
03:31:42,320 --> 03:31:42,780
Yep.

4396
03:31:43,280 --> 03:31:43,860
Thank you.

4397
03:31:50,520 --> 03:31:51,040
Ooh.

4398
03:31:53,520 --> 03:31:54,040
Lantern.

4399
03:31:54,280 --> 03:31:54,680
Oh.

4400
03:31:57,940 --> 03:31:59,600
I don't want any of them to smile.

4401
03:32:01,760 --> 03:32:02,940
Maybe they can't.

4402
03:32:02,940 --> 03:32:03,920
They're like, we're bird people.

4403
03:32:04,260 --> 03:32:05,380
We don't know how to smile.

4404
03:32:06,440 --> 03:32:08,480
We're bird deer people.

4405
03:32:10,760 --> 03:32:13,500
We don't know how to smile.

4406
03:32:15,240 --> 03:32:16,420
Oh, oh, oh, goodness.

4407
03:32:21,910 --> 03:32:23,130
Does this just lead outside?

4408
03:32:23,710 --> 03:32:24,230
Let's go.

4409
03:32:24,450 --> 03:32:24,970
Okay.

4410
03:32:24,970 --> 03:32:25,050
Let's just go.

4411
03:32:25,830 --> 03:32:26,990
No, no, please!

4412
03:32:27,110 --> 03:32:27,810
It's too dark!

4413
03:32:27,930 --> 03:32:32,510
Oh, it's

4414
03:32:36,080 --> 03:32:44,630
too close.

4415
03:32:57,550 --> 03:32:59,290
Oh, are you kidding me?

4416
03:33:05,150 --> 03:33:06,850
Oh my god.

4417
03:33:08,490 --> 03:33:10,970
I'm getting spooked for no reason!

4418
03:33:18,520 --> 03:33:19,980
This is a nice view.

4419
03:33:21,240 --> 03:33:22,880
The door to darkness.

4420
03:33:23,240 --> 03:33:24,260
Quite literally.

4421
03:33:26,420 --> 03:33:28,380
I wonder if we can see the water rising.

4422
03:33:33,950 --> 03:33:35,630
So we need...

4423
03:33:35,630 --> 03:33:39,490
We need another...

4424
03:33:41,690 --> 03:33:42,650
Another, uh...

4425
03:33:44,370 --> 03:33:44,850
Slide.

4426
03:33:45,590 --> 03:33:46,070
Reel.

4427
03:33:49,630 --> 03:33:52,110
And let's try going into this other building over here.

4428
03:33:54,510 --> 03:33:54,990
Wait!

4429
03:33:57,450 --> 03:33:58,410
Literally trolled.

4430
03:33:59,970 --> 03:34:02,470
There's this building here, but there's this one right here.

4431
03:34:03,690 --> 03:34:06,330
And if we just jump right in, maybe we can...

4432
03:34:07,690 --> 03:34:09,050
See what goes on here.

4433
03:34:09,250 --> 03:34:10,350
Can we fix the dam?

4434
03:34:17,400 --> 03:34:18,760
Don't launch sideways.

4435
03:34:20,500 --> 03:34:21,020
Silly.

4436
03:34:21,240 --> 03:34:22,120
Oh, that's me.

4437
03:34:22,920 --> 03:34:23,440
Ah!

4438
03:34:24,140 --> 03:34:24,660
Oh!

4439
03:34:24,860 --> 03:34:25,360
Oh!

4440
03:34:25,600 --> 03:34:26,120
Oh!

4441
03:34:26,700 --> 03:34:27,780
I'm scared though.

4442
03:34:27,820 --> 03:34:30,640
What if I launch the scout and I see a guy standing there?

4443
03:34:30,920 --> 03:34:31,720
I'm gonna be scared.

4444
03:34:31,980 --> 03:34:32,500
Okay.

4445
03:34:33,560 --> 03:34:34,080
Sun.

4446
03:34:37,320 --> 03:34:37,840
I.

4447
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:38,360
Fire.

4448
03:34:38,540 --> 03:34:39,060
I fire.

4449
03:34:39,520 --> 03:34:40,040
Sun.

4450
03:34:40,160 --> 03:34:40,760
I fire.

4451
03:34:40,840 --> 03:34:41,320
I fire.

4452
03:34:41,440 --> 03:34:41,640
Sun.

4453
03:34:41,760 --> 03:34:42,260
I fire.

4454
03:34:42,420 --> 03:34:43,200
I fire.

4455
03:34:44,100 --> 03:34:45,300
Wait, how do I get out of here?

4456
03:34:45,300 --> 03:34:45,680
Oh.

4457
03:34:50,380 --> 03:34:51,700
Oh, I can just look at it.

4458
03:34:53,760 --> 03:34:54,720
No, I can't.

4459
03:34:55,100 --> 03:34:55,540
Sun.

4460
03:34:57,420 --> 03:34:58,480
Or is it...

4461
03:34:58,480 --> 03:34:59,120
Yeah, okay.

4462
03:34:59,220 --> 03:34:59,540
Sun.

4463
03:35:01,860 --> 03:35:02,300
I.

4464
03:35:05,580 --> 03:35:06,020
Fire.

4465
03:35:10,320 --> 03:35:11,820
Wait, which I is it?

4466
03:35:12,580 --> 03:35:13,520
There's two of them.

4467
03:35:14,860 --> 03:35:15,580
No, there's not.

4468
03:35:15,580 --> 03:35:16,480
Fire.

4469
03:35:18,500 --> 03:35:19,180
Yippee!

4470
03:35:19,400 --> 03:35:19,600
Oh.

4471
03:35:19,980 --> 03:35:26,040
Come back, scout.

4472
03:35:33,050 --> 03:35:34,530
Thought I heard something.

4473
03:35:35,390 --> 03:35:37,410
This game's making me a little bit paranoid.

4474
03:35:38,710 --> 03:35:41,510
This game's making me just a tad paranoid.

4475
03:35:41,630 --> 03:35:42,610
Just a tad.

4476
03:35:45,850 --> 03:35:47,230
This thing's been destroyed.

4477
03:35:48,330 --> 03:35:49,010
Ooh.

4478
03:35:53,790 --> 03:35:54,450
Uh oh.

4479
03:35:54,850 --> 03:35:55,810
Uh oh.

4480
03:35:56,530 --> 03:35:57,530
Uh oh.

4481
03:35:58,990 --> 03:36:00,350
Uh oh.

4482
03:36:00,410 --> 03:36:01,250
Uh oh.

4483
03:36:01,730 --> 03:36:03,090
Uh oh.

4484
03:36:05,020 --> 03:36:06,520
Don't worry, you're alone.

4485
03:36:07,680 --> 03:36:09,600
That doesn't make me feel very good.

4486
03:36:11,300 --> 03:36:12,160
Wee-woo.

4487
03:36:13,140 --> 03:36:13,760
Wee-woo.

4488
03:36:15,540 --> 03:36:16,900
No... something.

4489
03:36:21,350 --> 03:36:22,770
No grabby hand.

4490
03:36:24,230 --> 03:36:25,790
Oh look, it's new guys.

4491
03:36:25,790 --> 03:36:27,970
Oh, these guys look like real travelers.

4492
03:36:28,150 --> 03:36:29,430
Like real spacemen.

4493
03:36:30,810 --> 03:36:31,790
It's a password.

4494
03:36:32,950 --> 03:36:34,830
Which maybe you shouldn't just have like...

4495
03:36:35,550 --> 03:36:37,030
...Lion straight open.

4496
03:36:37,270 --> 03:36:38,710
I got in so easily.

4497
03:36:39,050 --> 03:36:40,450
No chicken feet for you.

4498
03:36:41,270 --> 03:36:42,530
Yeah, it's the chicken foot.

4499
03:36:44,610 --> 03:36:45,150
Okay.

4500
03:36:48,950 --> 03:36:49,490
Hmm.

4501
03:36:50,190 --> 03:36:52,930
I like how it's decorated with their antlers.

4502
03:36:54,130 --> 03:36:55,890
They have a nice design choice.

4503
03:36:56,590 --> 03:36:58,750
You don't hang up your password as art?

4504
03:37:02,070 --> 03:37:06,110
Whatever next background I commission, I'm just gonna have my passwords in the background.

4505
03:37:06,490 --> 03:37:07,770
You'll never know.

4506
03:37:08,750 --> 03:37:09,870
You'll never know.

4507
03:37:16,110 --> 03:37:17,230
This was...

4508
03:37:45,890 --> 03:37:46,530
I'm okay.

4509
03:37:46,670 --> 03:37:46,990
Alright.

4510
03:37:49,290 --> 03:37:49,910
I'm okay.

4511
03:37:51,990 --> 03:37:54,690
I tried to go to that before and we couldn't.

4512
03:37:56,350 --> 03:37:57,790
I don't think I can make it now.

4513
03:37:58,130 --> 03:37:58,910
For sure.

4514
03:38:03,640 --> 03:38:05,120
There's a light up there.

4515
03:38:24,320 --> 03:38:25,320
I'm so sorry.

4516
03:38:25,320 --> 03:38:25,500
Sorry.

4517
03:38:34,020 --> 03:38:36,220
I'm drinking water.

4518
03:38:40,640 --> 03:38:41,480
Okay.

4519
03:38:42,800 --> 03:38:44,820
I wonder if I can get up there.

4520
03:38:47,260 --> 03:38:48,940
Oh god.

4521
03:38:52,680 --> 03:38:53,400
I lived.

4522
03:38:53,400 --> 03:38:53,560
I lived.

4523
03:38:54,360 --> 03:38:55,880
My vitals are low.

4524
03:38:59,330 --> 03:39:01,430
Maybe I should just meditate at this point.

4525
03:39:04,390 --> 03:39:05,270
Or that.

4526
03:39:17,520 --> 03:39:19,420
I can't stop coughing.

4527
03:39:19,980 --> 03:39:20,540
Why?

4528
03:39:31,240 --> 03:39:31,800
Yeah,

4529
03:40:02,930 --> 03:40:03,750
I'll get a cough drop.

4530
03:40:05,270 --> 03:40:06,730
I think I have some in here.

4531
03:40:41,700 --> 03:40:42,180
Sorry.

4532
03:40:54,490 --> 03:40:56,030
I might have to call it here.

4533
03:40:59,770 --> 03:41:01,190
I can breathe though.

4534
03:41:03,390 --> 03:41:04,210
I can breathe.

4535
03:41:04,590 --> 03:41:06,310
Let me try warm hot water for that cough.

4536
03:41:06,470 --> 03:41:06,770
I have.

4537
03:41:07,550 --> 03:41:08,030
Yeah.

4538
03:41:09,650 --> 03:41:10,130
Yeah.

4539
03:41:10,350 --> 03:41:10,650
Yeah.

4540
03:41:10,650 --> 03:41:10,670
Yeah.

4541
03:41:18,420 --> 03:41:22,820
Let's see how... if the cough drop helps at all.

4542
03:41:26,240 --> 03:41:27,700
Let's see if the cough drop helps at all.

4543
03:41:28,200 --> 03:41:31,080
I want to make it to that other building that was on the other side.

4544
03:41:31,880 --> 03:41:34,380
But I can't make it to once it breaks.

4545
03:41:39,700 --> 03:41:40,820
I'm so sorry.

4546
03:41:44,580 --> 03:41:45,480
No, Kai.

4547
03:41:46,540 --> 03:41:48,300
If I stop though, if I have to stop.

4548
03:41:48,420 --> 03:41:50,340
If I feel like I have to stop though, I will.

4549
03:41:50,760 --> 03:41:52,380
I have some hot water and natural honey.

4550
03:41:52,740 --> 03:41:53,620
Yeah, I have been.

4551
03:42:06,100 --> 03:42:08,860
If this is how it felt like though when I was...

4552
03:42:10,800 --> 03:42:13,020
When I was... when I first got sick.

4553
03:42:14,980 --> 03:42:16,160
When I was like...

4554
03:42:16,160 --> 03:42:16,300
Oh!

4555
03:42:16,440 --> 03:42:16,620
Oh!

4556
03:42:17,300 --> 03:42:18,780
I didn't even go inside.

4557
03:42:19,320 --> 03:42:20,480
It did it for me.

4558
03:42:21,220 --> 03:42:21,780
Nice.

4559
03:42:23,220 --> 03:42:23,780
Oh!

4560
03:42:25,080 --> 03:42:26,420
Coming in hot!

4561
03:42:27,100 --> 03:42:27,660
Wonk.

4562
03:42:28,080 --> 03:42:28,820
We're okay.

4563
03:42:30,800 --> 03:42:32,860
Just move over a little bit.

4564
03:42:33,620 --> 03:42:34,360
We're fine.

4565
03:42:35,040 --> 03:42:35,480
Oh!

4566
03:42:35,500 --> 03:42:36,760
Why is it so fast in here?

4567
03:42:37,720 --> 03:42:38,280
Oh!

4568
03:42:38,300 --> 03:42:38,740
Oh!

4569
03:42:38,760 --> 03:42:39,700
Where's the floor?

4570
03:42:41,120 --> 03:42:41,680
Oh!

4571
03:42:42,220 --> 03:42:42,780
Whatever.

4572
03:42:43,980 --> 03:42:44,540
Oh!

4573
03:42:54,940 --> 03:42:56,800
I couldn't tell where the floor was.

4574
03:42:58,760 --> 03:42:59,240
Oh!

4575
03:43:04,360 --> 03:43:04,840
Yay!

4576
03:43:04,980 --> 03:43:05,620
It fixed itself.

4577
03:43:07,140 --> 03:43:07,620
Okay.

4578
03:43:07,700 --> 03:43:10,000
So we're going to ride all the way down this dam.

4579
03:43:11,580 --> 03:43:12,060
Oh!

4580
03:43:12,580 --> 03:43:13,260
Wait a second.

4581
03:43:13,380 --> 03:43:13,780
There we go.

4582
03:43:16,360 --> 03:43:17,540
Ignore the ghost egg.

4583
03:43:18,760 --> 03:43:20,160
Landed sideways again.

4584
03:43:21,300 --> 03:43:22,360
I meant to do that.

4585
03:43:22,360 --> 03:43:22,860
Obviously.

4586
03:43:24,220 --> 03:43:24,660
Duh!

4587
03:43:27,540 --> 03:43:28,620
There's a dock I missed.

4588
03:43:29,020 --> 03:43:29,640
There is?

4589
03:43:32,440 --> 03:43:33,880
What dock did I miss?

4590
03:43:38,950 --> 03:43:39,390
Hello.

4591
03:43:39,550 --> 03:43:40,270
Keep going.

4592
03:43:41,390 --> 03:43:41,830
Whoa!

4593
03:43:44,810 --> 03:43:46,170
You missed the egg too.

4594
03:43:46,450 --> 03:43:46,890
No.

4595
03:43:46,990 --> 03:43:48,430
You guys missed the egg.

4596
03:43:48,630 --> 03:43:49,970
That's the first thing I'm going to...

4597
03:43:49,970 --> 03:43:50,170
Whoa!

4598
03:43:50,410 --> 03:43:53,450
That's the first thing I'm going to check as soon as I'm done with this.

4599
03:43:53,590 --> 03:43:55,150
I'm going to watch the VOD for this.

4600
03:43:55,170 --> 03:43:55,310
Oh!

4601
03:43:56,250 --> 03:43:57,790
Thanks for the $50 gift.

4602
03:43:57,870 --> 03:43:58,330
Thank you.

4603
03:44:00,410 --> 03:44:01,070
Oh my god.

4604
03:44:01,110 --> 03:44:03,070
This cough drop is already helping so much.

4605
03:44:04,890 --> 03:44:05,330
Wait.

4606
03:44:05,430 --> 03:44:06,230
I need to go on this side.

4607
03:44:11,860 --> 03:44:13,360
So that's the destroyed temple.

4608
03:44:21,140 --> 03:44:21,580
Whoa!

4609
03:44:22,200 --> 03:44:22,640
Whoa!

4610
03:44:23,400 --> 03:44:26,000
This feels like I'm on a... like a theme park ride.

4611
03:44:33,020 --> 03:44:33,460
Okay.

4612
03:44:33,580 --> 03:44:34,120
It's through here.

4613
03:44:34,420 --> 03:44:34,640
Oh!

4614
03:44:34,680 --> 03:44:35,420
There's this dock.

4615
03:44:35,580 --> 03:44:35,980
That's right.

4616
03:44:36,680 --> 03:44:37,120
Oh!

4617
03:44:37,140 --> 03:44:37,940
That's right.

4618
03:44:37,980 --> 03:44:38,520
This is this one.

4619
03:44:39,820 --> 03:44:40,960
I can't reach it though.

4620
03:44:42,100 --> 03:44:43,100
I missed it again.

4621
03:44:44,020 --> 03:44:44,660
But it's okay.

4622
03:44:44,700 --> 03:44:45,360
It's not our destination.

4623
03:44:45,940 --> 03:44:47,240
I love this game.

4624
03:44:51,160 --> 03:44:51,660
It's fine.

4625
03:44:51,720 --> 03:44:52,360
It's not our destination.

4626
03:44:56,790 --> 03:44:57,950
Two lights can back up.

4627
03:44:58,090 --> 03:44:58,330
Oh, really?

4628
03:45:00,990 --> 03:45:01,610
See that?

4629
03:45:02,070 --> 03:45:03,230
That's what I want to go see.

4630
03:45:04,250 --> 03:45:04,610
Whoa!

4631
03:45:05,570 --> 03:45:05,930
Nice.

4632
03:45:05,930 --> 03:45:06,130
Nice.

4633
03:45:06,190 --> 03:45:06,350
Nice.

4634
03:45:07,250 --> 03:45:07,610
Nice.

4635
03:45:07,610 --> 03:45:07,870
Nice.

4636
03:45:08,130 --> 03:45:08,490
Nice.

4637
03:45:09,870 --> 03:45:10,530
That's what I want to see.

4638
03:45:10,530 --> 03:45:12,890
Because it lifts up once the dam breaks.

4639
03:45:13,270 --> 03:45:20,370
So once the dam breaks, we cannot... we cannot go through to it anymore.

4640
03:45:24,710 --> 03:45:27,650
This sign won't stop me because I can't read.

4641
03:45:37,040 --> 03:45:38,240
It's broken.

4642
03:45:41,740 --> 03:45:42,400
Whoa.

4643
03:45:48,260 --> 03:45:49,680
Cough drop helped so much.

4644
03:45:51,760 --> 03:45:52,780
Goody good good.

4645
03:45:54,620 --> 03:45:55,180
What's that?

4646
03:45:55,300 --> 03:45:55,860
It was a chair.

4647
03:45:56,820 --> 03:45:58,540
And this one's also broken.

4648
03:46:00,460 --> 03:46:02,280
They probably said welcome in anyway.

4649
03:46:02,580 --> 03:46:02,980
Probably.

4650
03:46:08,500 --> 03:46:09,060
Huh.

4651
03:46:11,180 --> 03:46:12,640
How do we...

4652
03:46:17,370 --> 03:46:18,290
Is it time?

4653
03:46:18,430 --> 03:46:18,470
Let's go.

4654
03:46:18,470 --> 03:46:19,550
Do I just have to wait?

4655
03:46:20,250 --> 03:46:20,930
I wonder.

4656
03:46:22,030 --> 03:46:23,350
Can a scout get inside?

4657
03:46:32,750 --> 03:46:33,150
Hmm.

4658
03:46:40,980 --> 03:46:41,520
Let's try.

4659
03:46:46,340 --> 03:46:50,960
I don't want to wait until the dam breaks because that will take forever.

4660
03:46:57,240 --> 03:46:58,260
No, I don't think so.

4661
03:46:59,840 --> 03:47:04,400
I think every single person I've seen play this, and myself included, made that joke.

4662
03:47:05,980 --> 03:47:07,220
It's like so easy.

4663
03:47:07,560 --> 03:47:08,260
You know?

4664
03:47:10,080 --> 03:47:11,940
Because you literally can't read it.

4665
03:47:19,650 --> 03:47:21,070
What a great view though.

4666
03:47:23,430 --> 03:47:24,630
Just bash it in.

4667
03:47:25,690 --> 03:47:29,470
We're preserving the integrity of the location.

4668
03:47:29,790 --> 03:47:31,470
Well, this was kind of a bust then.

4669
03:47:31,750 --> 03:47:34,170
If we have to wait all the way until...

4670
03:47:34,170 --> 03:47:34,910
Let me try.

4671
03:47:35,250 --> 03:47:36,470
Getting to the...

4672
03:47:39,850 --> 03:47:40,710
Onto the roof.

4673
03:47:45,150 --> 03:47:47,310
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

4674
03:47:53,750 --> 03:47:54,350
It's me.

4675
03:47:58,280 --> 03:47:59,240
Uh-oh.

4676
03:48:03,320 --> 03:48:03,780
Huh?

4677
03:48:05,880 --> 03:48:06,760
Huh?

4678
03:48:08,720 --> 03:48:09,600
Huh?

4679
03:48:10,640 --> 03:48:11,080
Something...

4680
03:48:11,680 --> 03:48:14,540
Lifts in here and then it causes the dam to break.

4681
03:48:17,660 --> 03:48:18,960
Sorry, I tripped the...

4682
03:48:18,960 --> 03:48:19,900
I switched the cable.

4683
03:48:23,600 --> 03:48:25,140
The flicker is so spooky.

4684
03:48:25,240 --> 03:48:26,040
I know, right?

4685
03:48:26,160 --> 03:48:27,620
Because it like affects the whole map.

4686
03:48:34,240 --> 03:48:36,740
Sorry for me clearing my throat every two seconds.

4687
03:48:47,110 --> 03:48:47,590
Huh.

4688
03:48:48,590 --> 03:48:50,050
So this is all gonna break.

4689
03:48:50,950 --> 03:48:52,390
I saw some stairs here.

4690
03:48:52,390 --> 03:48:54,130
Oh, where does it go into?

4691
03:48:55,730 --> 03:48:56,210
Ouch.

4692
03:48:56,510 --> 03:48:57,190
We're fine.

4693
03:49:01,470 --> 03:49:01,950
Okay.

4694
03:49:03,890 --> 03:49:04,590
What's this?

4695
03:49:05,470 --> 03:49:06,250
I don't...

4696
03:49:06,250 --> 03:49:06,610
Oh, okay.

4697
03:49:06,670 --> 03:49:07,470
It's just a bunch of chairs.

4698
03:49:09,050 --> 03:49:10,410
Oh, the council.

4699
03:49:13,170 --> 03:49:13,810
Look it.

4700
03:49:13,810 --> 03:49:15,250
They saved the best seats for themselves.

4701
03:49:16,970 --> 03:49:17,890
The sun.

4702
03:49:21,290 --> 03:49:21,770
The sun.

4703
03:49:21,770 --> 03:49:22,250
The sun.

4704
03:49:22,370 --> 03:49:22,890
You have cooties.

4705
03:49:23,210 --> 03:49:24,510
I think so right now.

4706
03:49:25,450 --> 03:49:25,910
Yeah.

4707
03:49:27,290 --> 03:49:27,750
Unfortunately.

4708
03:49:28,710 --> 03:49:30,870
Please still love me even if I had cooties.

4709
03:49:32,670 --> 03:49:33,890
Oh, where are we going?

4710
03:49:37,290 --> 03:49:37,750
Okay.

4711
03:49:37,830 --> 03:49:39,290
I mean, it wasn't a total bust, I guess.

4712
03:49:39,470 --> 03:49:40,150
I'm scared.

4713
03:49:42,190 --> 03:49:42,650
Yeah.

4714
03:49:43,150 --> 03:49:44,010
Even better.

4715
03:49:44,510 --> 03:49:45,550
Don't be a freak.

4716
03:49:51,840 --> 03:49:53,460
Oh, I forgot to read the shiplog.

4717
03:49:53,980 --> 03:49:55,060
After the last one.

4718
03:49:57,340 --> 03:49:58,100
The sun?

4719
03:50:00,280 --> 03:50:01,660
This is their thing right now.

4720
03:50:02,280 --> 03:50:06,200
And I'm guessing... I feel like it would be a different symbol for the eye, right?

4721
03:50:09,440 --> 03:50:10,760
This is the stranger.

4722
03:50:11,980 --> 03:50:12,400
Danger.

4723
03:50:14,800 --> 03:50:15,960
Yeah, it's moving away.

4724
03:50:16,100 --> 03:50:17,260
Yeah, I noticed that too.

4725
03:50:18,080 --> 03:50:21,400
It's like pointed towards somewhere.

4726
03:50:30,360 --> 03:50:31,740
Minto still going, eh?

4727
03:50:31,780 --> 03:50:32,800
Just for a little bit longer.

4728
03:50:33,420 --> 03:50:40,020
I do want to get through enough progress that I feel comfortable that I could potentially finish tomorrow.

4729
03:50:45,560 --> 03:50:46,320
What's this?

4730
03:50:49,300 --> 03:50:49,480
Oh, okay.

4731
03:50:51,300 --> 03:50:51,860
Rotate.

4732
03:50:54,060 --> 03:50:54,620
Water?

4733
03:50:55,900 --> 03:50:57,180
Oh, it like resets it.

4734
03:50:58,640 --> 03:50:59,200
Right?

4735
03:51:02,460 --> 03:51:03,020
Huh.

4736
03:51:07,900 --> 03:51:09,080
It's a long DLC.

4737
03:51:09,580 --> 03:51:10,140
Oh!

4738
03:51:11,220 --> 03:51:11,780
Ow!

4739
03:51:12,900 --> 03:51:14,240
Oh, it's up and down!

4740
03:51:16,980 --> 03:51:18,320
We've got a lot to go.

4741
03:51:18,520 --> 03:51:18,980
That's okay.

4742
03:51:22,640 --> 03:51:23,200
Oh!

4743
03:51:23,280 --> 03:51:23,580
Oh!

4744
03:51:23,580 --> 03:51:24,200
Oh, wait.

4745
03:51:24,700 --> 03:51:25,920
Keep going down.

4746
03:51:29,660 --> 03:51:30,300
Maybe?

4747
03:51:30,480 --> 03:51:31,460
Oh, we're here?

4748
03:51:31,580 --> 03:51:32,140
Already?

4749
03:51:32,420 --> 03:51:33,000
Okay.

4750
03:51:34,740 --> 03:51:35,460
Don't go!

4751
03:51:35,560 --> 03:51:36,060
Don't leave me!

4752
03:51:37,280 --> 03:51:37,920
Oh!

4753
03:51:38,340 --> 03:51:38,980
What?

4754
03:51:39,080 --> 03:51:39,780
It's my ship!

4755
03:51:42,460 --> 03:51:45,660
We've discovered a hidden way to get back.

4756
03:51:47,580 --> 03:51:49,440
Oh, it's a shortcut!

4757
03:51:51,820 --> 03:51:52,520
Let's go.

4758
03:51:55,780 --> 03:52:04,900
I think when I saw what it said for the DLC, it said like 12 hours or something.

4759
03:52:06,060 --> 03:52:06,500
But...

4760
03:52:09,700 --> 03:52:12,540
If I have to go in three tries, that's okay too.

4761
03:52:13,840 --> 03:52:20,700
Though I did want to keep it all together so that the information is fresh in my brain.

4762
03:52:21,200 --> 03:52:21,960
But that's okay.

4763
03:52:23,740 --> 03:52:25,120
So far, I'm loving this.

4764
03:52:28,920 --> 03:52:29,700
I'm scared.

4765
03:52:29,900 --> 03:52:31,720
We're right on top of it.

4766
03:52:32,000 --> 03:52:33,900
And it's going to blow at any second.

4767
03:52:35,220 --> 03:52:37,940
It's going to collapse at any second, you guys.

4768
03:52:38,040 --> 03:52:39,440
This is so dangerous!

4769
03:52:41,680 --> 03:52:42,640
Oh, God!

4770
03:52:42,940 --> 03:52:43,780
Oh, God!

4771
03:52:43,840 --> 03:52:44,540
Oh, God!

4772
03:52:45,600 --> 03:52:49,220
If I was feeling better, I would endurance more of this for sure.

4773
03:53:00,110 --> 03:53:01,130
That's where we started.

4774
03:53:02,310 --> 03:53:03,410
That's where we started.

4775
03:53:05,010 --> 03:53:06,670
Oh, you can see it leaking through.

4776
03:53:08,550 --> 03:53:09,730
Oh, my God!

4777
03:53:09,910 --> 03:53:10,490
Oh, my God!

4778
03:53:10,550 --> 03:53:10,990
Oh, my God!

4779
03:53:11,410 --> 03:53:12,310
It's going to blow!

4780
03:53:12,470 --> 03:53:14,210
It's going to blow at any second now!

4781
03:53:18,730 --> 03:53:20,510
We have a full week this time.

4782
03:53:20,630 --> 03:53:21,070
Pace yourself.

4783
03:53:21,370 --> 03:53:21,590
Yeah!

4784
03:53:26,250 --> 03:53:29,810
I'm just going to slowly walk across the bridge back to the house.

4785
03:53:32,450 --> 03:53:34,530
You know, just taking my time.

4786
03:53:34,710 --> 03:53:40,150
How do I get back up there, though?

4787
03:53:45,590 --> 03:53:47,670
Cool, we discovered that shortcut.

4788
03:53:50,590 --> 03:53:51,110
That's fine.

4789
03:53:52,070 --> 03:53:54,450
I just got to get back to the house, I think, before...

4790
03:53:56,590 --> 03:53:58,250
before the dam breaks.

4791
03:54:02,920 --> 03:54:03,560
Or...

4792
03:54:04,780 --> 03:54:06,060
this thing.

4793
03:54:07,060 --> 03:54:08,540
It, like, lifts up.

4794
03:54:10,440 --> 03:54:12,380
But so does the... the house also lifts up.

4795
03:54:15,460 --> 03:54:16,720
Stand on it and wait.

4796
03:54:16,840 --> 03:54:17,460
You're immortal.

4797
03:54:23,100 --> 03:54:24,980
Run to the house!

4798
03:54:26,920 --> 03:54:27,700
Uh-oh.

4799
03:54:27,700 --> 03:54:28,180
Wait.

4800
03:54:28,180 --> 03:54:29,440
Here's the house!

4801
03:54:36,200 --> 03:54:38,380
Does this thing lift up or am I cra...

4802
03:54:39,180 --> 03:54:40,780
There goes my boat.

4803
03:54:48,600 --> 03:54:49,120
Eventually.

4804
03:54:56,480 --> 03:54:59,800
That's the... that's... I remember seeing this in one of the...

4805
03:55:01,400 --> 03:55:05,200
In one of the... slides, though.

4806
03:55:09,920 --> 03:55:13,820
Maybe I only thought that this lifted up because the water drained so much.

4807
03:55:18,300 --> 03:55:20,600
I think... I think that's the... what happened.

4808
03:55:20,980 --> 03:55:24,180
The water drained so much that I thought the house lifted up.

4809
03:55:24,340 --> 03:55:27,240
But it actually just stays in place and we just couldn't reach it before.

4810
03:55:32,140 --> 03:55:33,100
You bitch!

4811
03:55:36,120 --> 03:55:37,520
It's all about perspective.

4812
03:55:48,450 --> 03:55:50,050
I don't think I can do anything on here.

4813
03:55:53,690 --> 03:55:56,770
Though I am curious about...

4814
03:55:58,770 --> 03:56:01,710
about a spot... about the ghost matter spot now.

4815
03:56:01,850 --> 03:56:03,410
Is that all over... is that flooded?

4816
03:56:04,250 --> 03:56:04,550
Oh!

4817
03:56:05,050 --> 03:56:12,180
All places.

4818
03:56:12,560 --> 03:56:13,700
I had to...

4819
03:56:19,430 --> 03:56:20,790
Oh my god.

4820
03:56:21,290 --> 03:56:23,230
Well, let's go check it out if we can.

4821
03:56:24,850 --> 03:56:26,810
Hopefully I won't die trying to get there.

4822
03:56:26,950 --> 03:56:29,050
Because this water gets a little rough right here.

4823
03:56:31,490 --> 03:56:32,930
Let's go check out the ghost matter.

4824
03:56:36,510 --> 03:56:37,190
We're okay.

4825
03:56:46,510 --> 03:56:47,590
We made it!

4826
03:56:49,970 --> 03:56:51,950
This is the ghost matter over here.

4827
03:56:53,410 --> 03:56:54,850
Was the ghost matter with you?

4828
03:56:58,150 --> 03:56:59,370
Maybe it hates water.

4829
03:57:10,140 --> 03:57:10,560
Okay.

4830
03:57:12,640 --> 03:57:13,060
Oh!

4831
03:57:13,340 --> 03:57:14,800
That's promising though, right?

4832
03:57:22,290 --> 03:57:22,710
Yeah!

4833
03:57:23,090 --> 03:57:24,110
That's actually promising.

4834
03:57:24,430 --> 03:57:25,030
Okay, let's go in.

4835
03:57:26,230 --> 03:57:27,230
We can go in now.

4836
03:57:30,790 --> 03:57:31,490
Oh no!

4837
03:57:31,590 --> 03:57:32,330
There's a thingy!

4838
03:57:33,310 --> 03:57:33,730
Wait.

4839
03:57:33,830 --> 03:57:34,550
Can I pick this up?

4840
03:57:39,530 --> 03:57:40,670
Maybe that's not what I think.

4841
03:57:40,810 --> 03:57:40,990
Oh.

4842
03:57:41,570 --> 03:57:42,750
These people are just rich.

4843
03:57:43,490 --> 03:57:43,910
Maybe.

4844
03:57:44,030 --> 03:57:44,450
Maybe.

4845
03:57:44,650 --> 03:57:45,070
Maybe.

4846
03:57:45,070 --> 03:57:45,670
Let's try there.

4847
03:57:45,670 --> 03:57:46,230
Ship log updated.

4848
03:57:47,270 --> 03:57:47,730
Nice.

4849
03:57:49,370 --> 03:57:49,830
Okay.

4850
03:57:53,850 --> 03:57:54,310
Okay.

4851
03:57:57,270 --> 03:57:57,730
Cool.

4852
03:57:58,530 --> 03:57:59,450
Good stuff.

4853
03:57:59,990 --> 03:58:00,870
What the heck?

4854
03:58:00,870 --> 03:58:01,250
Oh!

4855
03:58:01,350 --> 03:58:02,490
These are the things that they're holding!

4856
03:58:02,770 --> 03:58:02,890
Oh!

4857
03:58:03,030 --> 03:58:04,050
I thought it was a...

4858
03:58:04,050 --> 03:58:04,950
I thought it was a slide.

4859
03:58:05,370 --> 03:58:05,670
No!

4860
03:58:05,710 --> 03:58:06,870
These are the things that they're holding!

4861
03:58:07,670 --> 03:58:08,130
Okay.

4862
03:58:09,010 --> 03:58:10,910
So, there was a symbolic...

4863
03:58:10,910 --> 03:58:12,050
What was the symbol in this place?

4864
03:58:14,490 --> 03:58:14,950
That!

4865
03:58:15,170 --> 03:58:16,210
The things that they're holding!

4866
03:58:16,370 --> 03:58:16,710
Okay.

4867
03:58:18,050 --> 03:58:20,650
What would you... what would you... look at that!

4868
03:58:21,110 --> 03:58:22,690
The little lanterns, yeah!

4869
03:58:24,910 --> 03:58:26,130
Who would have thunk?

4870
03:58:29,050 --> 03:58:30,750
Looks like you can get in from underneath.

4871
03:58:33,050 --> 03:58:38,310
But our ship log updated, so I wonder if we even need to come back.

4872
03:58:44,320 --> 03:58:48,020
Unless there's more stuff in here that we can't see because...

4873
03:58:48,020 --> 03:58:51,260
But I think there's also gonna be more... I think there's more ghost matter in there.

4874
03:58:53,660 --> 03:59:00,900
So I think maybe... we wouldn't be able to come in anyway.

4875
03:59:04,310 --> 03:59:05,590
But I will come back.

4876
03:59:06,070 --> 03:59:07,010
Just in case.

4877
03:59:07,370 --> 03:59:08,650
I wish I could get a boat.

4878
03:59:10,610 --> 03:59:10,990
Ouch.

4879
03:59:15,590 --> 03:59:16,790
Any boats available?

4880
03:59:17,990 --> 03:59:21,650
Okay, so besides that one other dock...

4881
03:59:22,630 --> 03:59:26,590
Is there any other place that... I mean, I know there's so much still left...

4882
03:59:27,110 --> 03:59:28,910
But what haven't we done?

4883
03:59:29,310 --> 03:59:32,750
Oh, there was another... there was another in the slides...

4884
03:59:32,750 --> 03:59:36,510
There was another one of these places, but it was a hole...

4885
03:59:37,330 --> 03:59:39,230
In the... in the ground.

4886
03:59:39,610 --> 03:59:40,930
It was like a little...

4887
03:59:41,570 --> 03:59:43,530
It was like a little cavern type one.

4888
03:59:46,270 --> 03:59:47,930
Still no egg, by the way.

4889
03:59:48,030 --> 03:59:49,990
That's because it... disappears!

4890
03:59:55,380 --> 03:59:57,300
The egg remains elusive!

4891
03:59:59,740 --> 04:00:01,680
Because it was literally there and then it disappears!

4892
04:00:03,480 --> 04:00:04,360
Quantum egg!

4893
04:00:05,860 --> 04:00:07,300
But I was staring at it.

4894
04:00:07,340 --> 04:00:09,520
I watched it go... I watched it fade out of existence.

4895
04:00:14,680 --> 04:00:16,300
I wonder if I can make it to that one.

4896
04:00:17,800 --> 04:00:18,780
There's a log over there.

4897
04:00:19,740 --> 04:00:20,880
Oh, there's another ship.

4898
04:00:22,360 --> 04:00:23,140
Come here, boat!

4899
04:00:23,380 --> 04:00:23,820
Come here!

4900
04:00:26,660 --> 04:00:28,220
Ouch, so close!

4901
04:00:30,160 --> 04:00:30,820
Come here!

4902
04:00:31,500 --> 04:00:32,120
Come here!

4903
04:00:34,740 --> 04:00:35,220
Nice.

4904
04:00:38,140 --> 04:00:39,180
Hey, hey, hey!

4905
04:00:39,360 --> 04:00:40,000
No pirates!

4906
04:00:40,100 --> 04:00:40,560
No pirates!

4907
04:00:44,380 --> 04:00:45,520
Echoes of the egg.

4908
04:00:46,080 --> 04:00:48,320
It could have been the eye this whole time.

4909
04:00:48,880 --> 04:00:49,840
You don't know!

4910
04:00:50,980 --> 04:00:52,060
You don't know!

4911
04:00:54,920 --> 04:00:56,980
Keep your eyes peeled for another...

4912
04:00:59,380 --> 04:01:00,260
Another place.

4913
04:01:00,480 --> 04:01:00,920
Another...

4914
04:01:02,040 --> 04:01:04,000
I'll have to look at the slideshow again, maybe.

4915
04:01:08,530 --> 04:01:09,870
The egg of the universe.

4916
04:01:16,220 --> 04:01:18,720
Wait, so if I fall in the water here, am I done-zo?

4917
04:01:20,280 --> 04:01:21,640
Am I, like, for real done-zo?

4918
04:01:22,800 --> 04:01:23,640
I wanna see.

4919
04:01:25,620 --> 04:01:27,860
This is the spot that we couldn't get to before, right?

4920
04:01:32,480 --> 04:01:33,420
Or maybe we could.

4921
04:01:33,820 --> 04:01:35,180
I can't remember, actually.

4922
04:01:46,460 --> 04:01:46,900
Oh!

4923
04:01:49,080 --> 04:01:49,520
Oh!

4924
04:01:51,360 --> 04:01:51,800
Oh!

4925
04:01:51,960 --> 04:01:52,900
There's so much here!

4926
04:01:53,400 --> 04:01:54,160
Wait a second.

4927
04:01:56,220 --> 04:01:57,460
Well, time to die.

4928
04:02:00,980 --> 04:02:01,840
This will be...

4929
04:02:01,840 --> 04:02:03,860
The next thing we explore...

4930
04:02:03,860 --> 04:02:04,600
Tomorrow!

4931
04:02:06,260 --> 04:02:07,520
Shabir, welcome to the membership!

4932
04:02:07,660 --> 04:02:08,060
Thank you!

4933
04:02:08,100 --> 04:02:09,420
I hope I said your name right.

4934
04:02:09,580 --> 04:02:10,140
Jump for it!

4935
04:02:10,400 --> 04:02:10,920
Okay!

4936
04:02:13,120 --> 04:02:13,640
Yoooooo!

4937
04:02:14,380 --> 04:02:14,900
Even

4938
04:02:23,370 --> 04:02:26,090
though I really, really wanna explore it right now.

4939
04:02:26,570 --> 04:02:27,510
But, um...

4940
04:02:29,470 --> 04:02:31,910
I really wanna explore it right now.

4941
04:02:32,070 --> 04:02:33,670
But, since I'm playing this again tomorrow...

4942
04:02:37,070 --> 04:02:38,690
I will refrain.

4943
04:02:39,690 --> 04:02:41,450
Dramatic music cuts out.

4944
04:02:41,930 --> 04:02:43,370
I'm not even gonna give...

4945
04:02:43,370 --> 04:02:45,890
I'm not gonna let the sun have the satisfaction, okay?

4946
04:02:47,650 --> 04:02:49,930
Are you still gonna do the direct watch-along?

4947
04:02:50,050 --> 04:02:50,490
Oh yeah!

4948
04:02:50,630 --> 04:02:51,930
Tomorrow's a Nintendo direct.

4949
04:02:52,510 --> 04:02:55,490
Um, I plan on doing a watch-along.

4950
04:02:55,610 --> 04:02:57,490
Because, um, you guys...

4951
04:02:57,490 --> 04:03:00,010
There's a little game called Tomodachi Life.

4952
04:03:00,350 --> 04:03:02,290
That I'm doing a summoning circle for.

4953
04:03:02,290 --> 04:03:04,850
And if a ghost does a summoning circle...

4954
04:03:04,850 --> 04:03:07,890
It is like ten times more effective.

4955
04:03:10,050 --> 04:03:10,450
So...

4956
04:03:10,950 --> 04:03:12,370
Um, it's quite early.

4957
04:03:13,410 --> 04:03:15,190
Oh my gosh, I just realized what time it is.

4958
04:03:15,230 --> 04:03:15,590
Oh my goodness.

4959
04:03:16,270 --> 04:03:16,670
Uh...

4960
04:03:16,670 --> 04:03:18,710
The stream is kind of early.

4961
04:03:18,870 --> 04:03:19,910
So I'll do my best.

4962
04:03:20,030 --> 04:03:22,490
It's actually when my alarm typically goes off.

4963
04:03:22,650 --> 04:03:22,910
So...

4964
04:03:22,910 --> 04:03:23,670
Thanks for the stream!

4965
04:03:23,710 --> 04:03:24,790
I love the vibes of this DLC.

4966
04:03:24,950 --> 04:03:26,750
I hope you get some rest and feel better soon.

4967
04:03:26,810 --> 04:03:27,330
Thank you!

4968
04:03:30,470 --> 04:03:30,870
Um...

4969
04:03:30,870 --> 04:03:32,110
But, uh...

4970
04:03:33,630 --> 04:03:34,510
But, um...

4971
04:03:35,110 --> 04:03:36,850
Yeah, this is usually when I wake up.

4972
04:03:38,950 --> 04:03:39,390
So...

4973
04:03:40,370 --> 04:03:40,810
Uh...

4974
04:03:40,810 --> 04:03:41,750
We'll see.

4975
04:03:43,250 --> 04:03:44,550
We'll see if I...

4976
04:03:44,550 --> 04:03:46,510
I'll make a waiting room for it tonight, though.

4977
04:03:46,750 --> 04:03:47,170
Um...

4978
04:03:47,170 --> 04:03:48,830
And I might be a little...

4979
04:03:48,830 --> 04:03:51,130
I might be a little few minutes late or something.

4980
04:03:51,310 --> 04:03:51,610
Who knows?

4981
04:03:52,390 --> 04:03:52,830
DLC...

4982
04:03:53,570 --> 04:03:56,550
Is a great addition to an obviously special game.

4983
04:03:56,630 --> 04:03:57,610
Glad you're enjoying it.

4984
04:03:57,670 --> 04:04:00,170
It's so cool to see how differently you learn and progress through it.

4985
04:04:00,230 --> 04:04:00,410
Right?

4986
04:04:00,510 --> 04:04:01,230
It's so cool!

4987
04:04:01,710 --> 04:04:02,270
I appreciate it.

4988
04:04:02,830 --> 04:04:04,390
I hope you feel better soon, Minto.

4989
04:04:04,490 --> 04:04:04,950
Thank you!

4990
04:04:04,990 --> 04:04:06,290
I'm gonna rest my voice...

4991
04:04:06,890 --> 04:04:08,250
My throat lots tonight.

4992
04:04:08,910 --> 04:04:09,290
Um...

4993
04:04:09,790 --> 04:04:10,230
So...

4994
04:04:11,430 --> 04:04:12,950
Hopefully I can get over...

4995
04:04:13,610 --> 04:04:14,870
Over this sickness.

4996
04:04:15,610 --> 04:04:16,050
Man...

4997
04:04:16,050 --> 04:04:17,550
You can all blame Mataro.

4998
04:04:20,730 --> 04:04:21,170
Um...

4999
04:04:21,170 --> 04:04:22,090
But yeah!

5000
04:04:23,210 --> 04:04:23,650
Um...

5001
04:04:23,650 --> 04:04:24,510
Awesome, Minto!

5002
04:04:24,750 --> 04:04:25,710
Thank you, guys!

5003
04:04:25,910 --> 04:04:26,350
Um...

5004
04:04:26,350 --> 04:04:27,350
We'll play more of this tomorrow.

5005
04:04:28,490 --> 04:04:30,590
And if I see you at the direct, I'll see you at the direct.

5006
04:04:31,810 --> 04:04:32,250
Bye!

5007
04:04:32,250 --> 04:04:35,270
If you have secrets for throat recovery, it's not my throat though.

5008
04:04:35,310 --> 04:04:36,810
It's like in my chest, you know?

5009
04:04:37,290 --> 04:04:38,590
That's making me cough.

5010
04:04:38,950 --> 04:04:39,470
So...

5011
04:04:40,410 --> 04:04:40,930
Uh...

5012
04:04:40,930 --> 04:04:41,890
Though the...

5013
04:04:41,890 --> 04:04:42,790
The...

5014
04:04:43,810 --> 04:04:44,330
The...

5015
04:04:46,090 --> 04:04:47,570
The cough drop did help.

5016
04:04:48,370 --> 04:04:48,890
Um...

5017
04:04:49,970 --> 04:04:51,170
Down with the sickness.

5018
04:04:51,730 --> 04:04:52,950
Down with the sickness!

5019
04:04:53,190 --> 04:04:54,270
Down with it!

5020
04:04:54,490 --> 04:04:55,530
Down boy, down!

5021
04:05:00,030 --> 04:05:00,730
But yeah!

5022
04:05:01,130 --> 04:05:01,650
Um...

5023
04:05:01,650 --> 04:05:03,430
Take care of yourself, man.

5024
04:05:03,470 --> 04:05:04,030
Thank you!

5025
04:05:04,190 --> 04:05:05,150
Thank you, guys!

5026
04:05:05,370 --> 04:05:06,250
Hope your cough goes away.

5027
04:05:06,310 --> 04:05:06,730
Thank you!

5028
04:05:07,890 --> 04:05:09,430
Are you watching the direct live?

5029
04:05:09,750 --> 04:05:11,010
Yes, I would watch it live.

5030
04:05:11,770 --> 04:05:12,610
If I...

5031
04:05:12,610 --> 04:05:14,110
If I make it.

5032
04:05:27,680 --> 04:05:28,200
I'll

5033
04:05:32,740 --> 04:05:35,020
see you guys tomorrow for more!

5034
04:05:35,600 --> 04:05:37,300
For more Outer Wilds.

5035
04:05:37,300 --> 04:05:40,100
And we'll explore more stuff and uncover more mystery!

5036
04:05:40,100 --> 04:05:41,820
And if I have to do it in...

5037
04:05:42,280 --> 04:05:43,300
two more streams.

5038
04:05:43,920 --> 04:05:45,220
So, in a three-parter.

5039
04:05:45,300 --> 04:05:45,880
That's okay too.

5040
04:05:46,440 --> 04:05:47,160
No worries.

5041
04:05:48,000 --> 04:05:48,540
Thank you!

5042
04:05:48,800 --> 04:05:50,120
I love listening to this though.

5043
04:05:50,740 --> 04:05:53,420
Hold on, let's go find a nice...

5044
04:05:58,480 --> 04:06:00,600
Let's go find a nice little spot to relax.

5045
04:06:06,000 --> 04:06:07,240
I don't wanna look at the sun.

5046
04:06:09,320 --> 04:06:10,120
Where's the planet?

5047
04:06:14,100 --> 04:06:15,140
I'm so short.

5048
04:06:18,900 --> 04:06:19,940
I've been meaning to...

5049
04:06:19,940 --> 04:06:20,180
Oh!

5050
04:06:20,700 --> 04:06:21,660
The interloper!

5051
04:06:22,320 --> 04:06:24,680
I've been meaning to get the soundtrack for this.

5052
04:06:26,040 --> 04:06:28,280
When I was buying it again, I tried to get the soundtrack.

5053
04:06:28,360 --> 04:06:29,080
But it was like...

5054
04:06:29,080 --> 04:06:30,980
It was weird on Steam, so...

5055
04:06:31,900 --> 04:06:32,340
Okay!

5056
04:06:32,680 --> 04:06:34,120
Okay, Otsumito for real.

5057
04:06:34,220 --> 04:06:35,180
Message is short.

5058
04:06:35,520 --> 04:06:37,060
I love how stranger is he.

5059
04:06:41,200 --> 04:06:41,640
Okay.

5060
04:06:41,980 --> 04:06:42,820
Bye, guys!

5061
04:06:43,360 --> 04:06:44,720
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye!

5062
04:06:45,000 --> 04:06:45,740
See you tomorrow!

5063
04:06:47,480 --> 04:06:48,040
See you!

5064
04:06:48,160 --> 04:06:48,740
Bye-bye!
