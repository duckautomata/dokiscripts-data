1
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,420
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

2
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

3
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,100
I do believe this is on.

4
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,080
Can we please lower the music?

5
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,160
Please.

6
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,660
Thank you.

7
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,750
Ah, ah, ah.

8
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:06,970
Thank you.

9
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,850
Thank you very much.

10
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,350
Thank you.

11
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,430
Thank you, everyone, for being here today.

12
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,890
Yes.

13
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,390
Greetings, my fine constituents.

14
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:31,250
I'd like to say, first of all, thank you for your continued support of the Made Mint Mint Phantom YouTube channel.

15
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:40,330
You may be wondering what today's debut has been scheduled to be all about.

16
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:47,230
Oh, well, I will tell you, you know, I began my journey back in July of 2020.

17
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,990
Mm-hmm.

18
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,550
Mm-hmm.

19
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,350
And it has been a long year.

20
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,970
Wait, five.

21
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,710
Well, I've been back for...

22
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,530
Oh, hold on.

23
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,790
My notes.

24
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,150
Hold on.

25
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,930
I wrote that wrong.

26
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,330
It has been...

27
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,930
It has been a long, nearly five years of haunting.

28
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,530
Yeah.

29
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,030
Yeah, 2020 is a long year, huh?

30
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,910
And I'm sorry, serious.

31
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:26,530
Well, I would still like to keep haunting your everyday lives and, you know, continue stealing all your life force.

32
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,930
That sweet, sweet life force.

33
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,970
I also felt it was time for me to branch out into a new avenue.

34
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:43,090
And so I would like to extend my talents into something I feel is very passionate to me.

35
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,010
And that's idols, baby.

36
00:05:46,670 --> 00:06:03,650
I put out an international wide search for the most passionate, the cutest, the most talented, the best of the best, the cream of the crop idols that the world has ever seen.

37
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,910
And I combed through thousands of entries.

38
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:14,110
And I definitely didn't use a lottery random number picker.

39
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:22,310
And so the true best of the best stands here with me today.

40
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:32,570
And I would like to announce that I have created my own new VTuber idol group and their debut will be in just a few minutes.

41
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,750
I would like to introduce you to Twinkle Dogs.

42
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,090
Yes, Twinkle Dogs.

43
00:06:48,830 --> 00:07:01,170
These five new sparkling members of Twinkle Dogs will make you feel joy, happiness, and many other human emotions that mean fun.

44
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:09,070
Everyone has that dog in them, that spark that makes those dogs twinkle and shine on their idol journey.

45
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,770
And that's how Twinkle Dogs was born.

46
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:21,730
I would also like to announce that at the end of their individual debuts, there will be an original song created by yours truly.

47
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:27,070
The title, Make You Coon Coon Cooter Doon Friday Night.

48
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,290
So please stick around until the very end.

49
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,870
Okay, okay.

50
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,610
Yes.

51
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,450
So their concept is something that hasn't been quite done yet in the idol VTuber world.

52
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,350
I would even say the idol world.

53
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,610
We are quite the revolutionary minds here.

54
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,910
AKA me, mind.

55
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,570
You may have heard of AKB48's concept, the idols you can meet.

56
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,230
But I have changed the concept.

57
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,670
I've made it better.

58
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,890
Instead, our members are the idols at your own convenience.

59
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,410
And I know VTuber fans want to talk to their favorite VTuber at any time.

60
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,310
And with this new system, you can.

61
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,210
The system works like this.

62
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,670
Each Twinkle Dog will tell you their personal phone number and you can call them.

63
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,390
Isn't that just so exciting?

64
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,000
Now.

65
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,260
Are you all ready to meet the members?

66
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,960
We have a brief introduction video.

67
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,700
That was cut.

68
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,020
Due to budget constraints.

69
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,520
Anyway.

70
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:09,520
Give your best group howl for Twinkle Dogs.

71
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,380
Describe it to us.

72
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,800
Oh, okay.

73
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,120
Brief introduction video.

74
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,300
Look, it goes like this.

75
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,480
First member.

76
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,880
Well, I can't.

77
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,940
I can't do their voices.

78
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,830
You're just gonna have to hear the lore, see the lore, experience the lore.

79
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,810
Them themselves.

80
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,290
Oh my god.

81
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,430
I was so nervous.

82
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,510
Wow.

83
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,290
This is my debut.

84
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:28,770
Wow.

85
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,830
I can't believe I'm here.

86
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:30,650
Okay.

87
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,070
I don't have very much time.

88
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,230
So I'm being told that I have to, you know.

89
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,070
Pick up the pace.

90
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,690
All right.

91
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,910
I'm gonna throw you.

92
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,690
Wait, I already messed up.

93
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,770
I'm gonna.

94
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,750
I'm gonna show.

95
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,270
Not throw.

96
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,230
I'm gonna show you guys.

97
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,910
Myself.

98
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,830
In three, two, one.

99
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,450
Hi guys.

100
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,130
My name is Sen.

101
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,790
My lore is that I'm a nerd and I'm also a goon.

102
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,570
Okay, I'm gonna show you guys my introduction video.

103
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:17,690
Not video.

104
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,010
Sorry.

105
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,630
I don't have that much money.

106
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,450
Why do I keep saying video?

107
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,110
Oh my god.

108
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:23,530
Okay.

109
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,610
Anyway, I'm very cool and I'm very awesome and you'll see from my.

110
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,410
Powerpoint.

111
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,710
Yeah, welcome to Sen's nerd den.

112
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,450
I'm number one, two, zero, four.

113
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,050
Yeah, ignore the other text on the screen.

114
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,590
About me.

115
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,110
I wrote a lot in my audition.

116
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,590
So I'm just gonna read it word for word because it's kind of a.

117
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,110
Impressive.

118
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,190
So I am indeed a freaky wisp.

119
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,890
I'm 23.

120
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,730
My color is blue in the group.

121
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,570
I am INFP.

122
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,650
I don't actually know what that means.

123
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,870
Okay, but and my height is average.

124
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,550
I'm a I'm the one who keeps the freak meter down low.

125
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,150
When you first meet me, I could be stoic and a bit standoffish.

126
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,970
But once you get to know me, I open up into being witty.

127
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:37,030
Performative and yes, freaky as I have absorbed much influence from freak phantom herself.

128
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,490
Give it up for my boss.

129
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,930
I've been a TLDR.

130
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,910
I am overwhelmingly have a personality of an artist with all the good and bad that comes with that.

131
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,690
My name is Sen.

132
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,610
Did I say that?

133
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,070
Oh, I have a one-liner because I'm a goon, right?

134
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,570
And I'm a nerd.

135
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,950
My one-liner is actually, I'm the one that stole your heart.

136
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,330
Yeah, pretty good, huh?

137
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,870
Yeah, and this is what I look like.

138
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,170
Did you guys see the whole model?

139
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,730
See it?

140
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:17,970
Yeah.

141
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,970
Yeah, pretty good.

142
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:20,650
Pretty good.

143
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,270
Pretty cool.

144
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,370
Yeah.

145
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,030
Yeah.

146
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:30,170
And um, did YouTube crash?

147
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,710
Why is my chat so awkward?

148
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,710
On my debut?

149
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,230
This is so messed up.

150
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,570
Hold on.

151
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,130
Am I live?

152
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,680
Anyway, I'm just going to keep, oh, there we go.

153
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,100
I'm live.

154
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,940
Okay, cool.

155
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,240
Yeah, I'm so nervous.

156
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,120
Oh my gosh, guys.

157
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,960
Anyway, yeah, my phone number is down here.

158
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,140
And oh, my secret talent.

159
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
I'm always pitch perfect.

160
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,080
You might hear me in like the end of like the song that we're in.

161
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,460
That we did.

162
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,260
It's like...

163
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,330
That's my secret talent.

164
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,470
My likes and my dislikes.

165
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,730
Yeah, I like video games.

166
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,690
I'm such a nerd.

167
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,870
I like animals.

168
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,190
Such a nerd.

169
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,890
I like anime and manga.

Dinosaurs.

171
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,610
Creative pursuits.

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,070
NASCAR.

173
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,870
That's like my most normie hobby.

174
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,950
My boss.

175
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,990
Yeah, I like her.

176

And nerding out.

177
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,290
I'm really ready to nerd out at any time.

178
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,050
Yeah.

179
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,350
My dislikes.

180
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,550
Any weather that isn't perfect temperature.

181
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,870
Gosh, I'm just really, you know, picky like that.

182
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,950
It's got to be like, can't be too hot.

183
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,970
Can't be too cold.

184
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,890
And smelling bad.

185
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,630
So you can't call me stinky.

186
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,890
And crickets.

187
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,790
Why did I write about that?

188
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,090
Crickets.

189
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,050
Crickets.

190
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:31,950
Oh, here's my dislike.

191
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:39,530
I have a lizard and my beef with the crickets that start chirping randomly in our cage in the middle of the night is intensive.

192
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,550
Oh, yeah.

193
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,110
That's so horrible.

194
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,190
Yeah.

195
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,790
And deer.

196
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:51,330
Because one jumped out in the middle of the road and did a front flip in front of the first car.

197
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,870
I totally totaled it.

198
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,450
And since then, anytime I see a deer, I give him a big old middle finger.

199
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:58,830
Yeah.

200
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,190
Oh, I forgot to say.

201
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,010
Oh my gosh.

202
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,670
You're probably wondering why this guy is on my thing.

203
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,350
People say I look like him.

204
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,610
What do you guys think?

205
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,330
I'm putting on my best smile right now for you, though.

206
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,770
Yeah.

207
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:11,970
Yeah.

208
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,150
Yeah.

209
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,350
You see it?

210
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,790
Yeah.

211
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:17,870
Yeah.

212
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,310
Anyway.

213
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,790
I also don't like when people talk to me, but I don't want to talk.

214
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,870
So, uh, don't talk to me.

215
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,270
Unless we're talking now.

216
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,090
That's fine.

217
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,290
Oh, sorry.

218
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,410
I'm being told to wrap it up.

219
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,250
My schedule for this week.

220
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,510
I took one out of your book, Miss Phantom.

221
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,450
Love you.

222
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,470
Yeah.

223
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,710
Monday dredge, Tuesday dredge, Wednesday dredge, Thursday dredge, Friday dredge, Saturday dredge, Sunday dredge.

224
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,270
See you there.

225
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,470
Thanks, guys.

226
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,650
Hope you enjoyed my debut.

227
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,050
Thanks.

228
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:52,990
Bye.

229
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:21,190
Oh God, I still had the reverb on.

230
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,510
It's my turn now.

231
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,030
And, uh, yep.

232
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,970
I'm gonna throw a show myself.

233
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,030
Wait, I'm gonna show myself in three, two, one.

234
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,630
The name's Patty.

235
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,910
P-A-D-D-Y.

236
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,830
Not like Patty.

237
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,750
Like, you know, not like Patty.

238
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,490
Like, like a girl.

239
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,720
Yep.

240
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,860
And I'm your DILF of the group.

241
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,620
And let me show you what I'm all about.

242
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,540
Yeah, I don't know where I am.

243
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,780
Okay, old man Patty's here.

244
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,100
Yep.

245
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
Young nerds beware.

246
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,600
Uh, oh, my lore is I am, uh, I am the ghost of future nerds.

247
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,760
So, Sen, you better look out.

248
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,780
Uh, you're probably wondering how old this, uh, old timer is.

249
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,460
I'm 30.

250
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,360
And I already died of old age.

251
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,120
My color is white.

252
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,120
I don't know what I'm doing.

253
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,800
I'm old, but like, I'm a cool, old, uberly, tall, and hot.

254
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,740
Sorry, I have a cough.

255
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,800
And sorry, I don't have a phone to give you, but I have an old Tamagotchi.

256
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,120
And that's also my manager.

257
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:06,700
So if you need to talk to me, uh, you can contact my manager in my Tamagotchi.

258
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm just gonna put myself here.

259
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,600
And, uh, my likes and my dislikes.

260
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,460
I don't like anything.

261
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,740
And, uh, uh, my hair is supposed to be red, can you tell?

262
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,720
Or is it too faded?

263
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,120
Yeah.

264
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,920
What's based?

265
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,160
My, my, I do have foundation.

266
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
My dislikes are squid.

267
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,800
And, uh, organizing things.

268
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,840
Oh, wow, uh, thanks for super chat.

269
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,900
Uh, I'm just gonna give that to my boss.

270
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,220
Oh, don't worry about that.

271
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,180
I hate loud machines.

272
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,540
I didn't write any reasoning why.

273
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,420
I just don't like these things.

274
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,140
And I also hate, uh, onward march of time.

275
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,290
My schedule.

276
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,250
Monday, I, is now, I think.

277
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,950
And I'm going to a debut, which I am doing.

278
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,790
And then I will nap.

279
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,490
And then tomorrow I have off.

280
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,910
Because of my mesotheliomia.

281
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,590
Wednesday, I'm warning the youth of their future downfall.

282
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,250
So, everybody under the age of 30 can join.

283
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:57,890
And, or over 30, you can also, uh, speak wisdom to the youngins under 30.

284
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,850
Friday is organize my pills.

285
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,930
It's a headscan.

286
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,450
Sorry, sorry, I have a cough.

287
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,430
And then Saturday.

288
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,370
I don't know.

289
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,210
We'll see if I'm still around by then.

290
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Sorry, I forgot.

291
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,900
Sunday, I also have that day off.

292
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,160
Because that's grandpa's day.

293
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,980
Oh, thank you guys for the superchats.

294
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

295
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,880
Yeah, you like my BGM?

296
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,540
It's custom.

297
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,660
Pretty good.

298
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,180
Anyway, um, I'm being told to wrap it up now as well.

299
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,480
So, thanks for coming to my debut.

300
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,530
And y'all, you guys are all very pretty.

301
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,440
And, oh, daddy!

302
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,740
That's exactly what I wanted to be called.

303
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,880
And you're probably wondering why my hand does that.

304
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,020
It's because I'm just perpetually stuck in the I'm-actually pose.

305
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,160
Because I'm the ghost of future nerd.

306
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,220
Don't be like me.

307
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,760
Children.

308
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,240
Okay.

309
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,880
Don't forget to stick around for the original song at the end of today's stream.

310
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,500
Thank you.

311
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,160
Bye.

312
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,490
Oops.

313
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,540
I'm Sheba.

314
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,900
I tell you about Sheba.

315
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,200
My name's Sheba.

316
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,680
Time to tell you about Sheba.

317
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,080
My name is Sheba.

318
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,450
And I'm so rich.

319
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,350
But I'm missing a few body parts.

320
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,830
I, it's no big deal.

321
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,850
Wisps with cute butts.

322
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,250
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

323
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,610
Ah, yeah.

324
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:47,150
And, I just, yeah, uh, Sheba, Sheba, uh, really likes spreading...

325
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,740
Dislikes.

326
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,460
Bright lights are no no.

327
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,020
Did I mention I'm six f...

328
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,670
Get that away from me.

329
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,030
Uh...

330
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,030
I'm also...

331
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,770
Six fat...

332
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,540
I forgot my schedule.

333
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,300
Anyway, Sheba says thanks for coming to my debut.

334
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,640
Enjoy the rest of the debuts.

335
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,440
Bye!

336
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,810
Oops.

337
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,200
Hey guys.

338
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:06,980
Um...

339
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,820
My name's, uh...

340
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,400
My name's, uh...

341
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,360
My name's Indy.

342
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,160
And, um...

343
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,320
It's kind of funny.

344
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,600
I applied to, uh, you know...

345
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,660
I was an Indy Vtuber and I applied to be part of a company and, uh...

346
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,540
I actually don't really know how I got here.

347
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,680
I've been told I need to...

348
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,420
introduce myself.

349
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,300
I'm not... My name is Indy.

350
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,760
Not like... It's not a pun.

351
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,780
But it's kind of funny.

352
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,160
I don't know why I'm here.

353
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,100
I don't know how I got here.

354
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,140
Uh, okay, uh...

355
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,460
Oh.

356
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,870
Sorry, I'm an Indy Vtuber.

357
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,370
I guess I'll just put myself above it.

358
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,900
I have to fill it out as I go, because I...

359
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,740
So, um...

360
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,360
Indy.

361
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,480
That's my name.

362
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,380
Indy.

363
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm 30.

364
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,560
Once you get to know me, this is kind of a bad place to meet.

365
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,860
Uh...

366
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,580
Uh...

367
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,300
Uh, I'm sarcastic.

368
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,240
Um...

369
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,940
I'm, uh...

370
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,960
I like to banter, you know?

371
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,080
Uh...

372
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,340
Um...

373
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,040
They're telling me to say a town.

374
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,500
And my phone number?

375
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,510
Whoa, guys, this is not me typing my phone number.

376
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,010
This is... I think someone took over my computer.

377
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,690
This is not me typing.

378
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,270
This is... This is not me typing.

379
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,010
That's my number!

380
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,990
That's my number!

381
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,030
I

382
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,220
don't really know what to do here.

383
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,040
My likes and my dislikes?

384
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,640
Okay, uh...

385
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,040
Uh, I like golfing.

386
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,360
I like gammering.

387
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,260
I like working out.

388
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,580
I like reading and manga.

389
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,180
I like drinking coffee.

390
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,140
I don't know, normal guy stuff?

391
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,680
This is totally normal, no?

392
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,760
And my dislikes?

393
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,360
Oh gosh, they're really pressuring me.

394
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,660
I like, or I don't like scary stuff.

395
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,040
I'm a weenie.

396
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,880
Sad.

397
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,360
I hate, I dislike hot...

398
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,000
ass summer.

399
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,860
But I like...

400
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,280
hot ass.

401
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,300
Okay, that's important to differentiate.

402
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,560
Uh, and it's almost summer now.

403
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,600
Oh man.

404
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,400
And I hate cold ass winter.

405
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,640
And tomatoes.

406
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,680
This is so normal.

407
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,340
I don't think I belong here.

408
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,700
I don't think I belong here, you guys.

409
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,640
I don't think I was supposed to...

410
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,020
I don't think this was my schedule.

411
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,180
Oh my god.

412
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,220
Monday.

413
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,320
Oh my god!

414
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,200
This is not me typing, you guys.

415
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,260
This is not me typing.

416
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,800
Oh my god.

417
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,440
This is, something is on my computer.

418
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,580
How did it, how did they get my information?

419
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,620
Guys, please.

420
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,820
I don't know, I don't know how else to reach you.

421
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,820
I don't know, hold on.

422
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,160
I'm just gonna get rid of the Powerpoint.

423
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,700
I don't know how else to reach you.

424
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,260
But you guys, I need your help.

425
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,880
I need, I'm not supposed to be here.

426
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,400
This is, this was a mistake.

427
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,500
I don't think I'm supposed to...

428
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,080
Hello.

429
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,340
I am a duck.

430
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,230
My name is Duck Q.

431
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,140
My catchphrase is...

432
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,670
Quack it, don't whack it.

433
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,760
Let me show you about me.

434
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,160
I am 33 years old.

435
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,240
My birthday is today.

436
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,450
Happy birthday to Duck.

437
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,110
I am Mallard.

438
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,900
Please call me on the phone.

439
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,130
My likes.

440
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,830
Friends, math, science, drawing, languages, animals, and invidia.

441
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,360
My dislikes.

442
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,660
Drama, not theater, kind, politics.

443
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,080
Do you agree with Duck?

444
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,940
I think, if you like and dislike these things, Duck can be good friends.

445
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,340
Schedule.

446
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,480
Duck Pond Retaste Test Roblox Bread Carrying Tour My Pond Quack Challenge.

447
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,220
How many breads can I eat?

448
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,060
Very excited schedule.

449
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,410
Please take care of Duck.

450
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,910
Thank

451
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,620
you for watching.

452
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,150
Their original song.

453
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,230
What was it?

454
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,690
They worked very hard on it and so did I.

455
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,670
Thank you very much everybody.

456
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,150
Enjoy the music video.

457
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,870
It's a Friday night.

458
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,740
I'm just a dog, but I belong in a zoo.

459
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,760
Your heart's so loud, I can hear it from the other room.

460
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,960
It's a good-a-do, Saturday, whoops, Friday night.

461
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,000
Give me a chance to make it sound right.

462
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,580
I've got the day wrong, I should've checked it twice.

463
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,160
I'm a dog, I can be naughty or nice.

464
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,920
I can see a twinkle in your eyes.

465
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,440
A little lick on your nose for a surprise.

466
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,820
Don't turn me down or I'll be so glum.

467
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,440
You can pat my head or scratch my bum.

468
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,900
It's a good-a-do, Friday, whoops, suddenly it's Sunday.

469
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,760
Where do the days go, I can't even try anymore.

470
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,360
You know what they say.

471
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,180
Dogs can't breathe.

472
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,100
It's a killing computer, next weekday.

473
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,140
No matter when, it is a bug in your way.

474
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,260
Sorry that I misread the calendar.

475
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,600
Maybe we can try next week.

476
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,430
Thank you!

477
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,670
