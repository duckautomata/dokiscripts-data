It's fine.

65
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,480
No, don't worry about it.

66
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,120
It'll look better for the lack of actual effort put into this edit.

67
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:14,780
Yeah, exactly.

68
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,700
It's funnier like that.

69
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,400
Okay, guys.

70
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,460
I'm still trying to get Mimi onto my screen.

71
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,800
Do you want a PNG or something?

72
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,120
Okay, I got her in.

73
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,520
Okay.

74
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,380
I have to like make a new one.

75
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,860
I think it's your fault, Doki.

76
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,540
How is it my fault?

77
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,540
I just want to give you guys little hats, though.

78
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:40,820
I have, like, four ears because your ears are so big, I can't cover them without making me impossibly huge.

79
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,020
So now I have, like, ferret ears and cat ears sticking out from them, so that's fine.

80
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,120
That's the new meta.

81
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,160
Everyone becomes a cat, girl.

82
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,480
Oh, yeah.

83
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,240
Yeah, man, we want to explain the game we were originally going to play.

84
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,800
You know how people thought we were going to do a severance watch a party?

85
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,900
Is that what they thought?

86
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:23,940
god that was like a whole show called severance yeah we're gonna watch party severance or some no it was a game i uh it was a game where it's literally phasmophobia but someone can play as the ghost and i was like reading comments from like the dev and it seemed like they were like people were like they should add this to phasmophobia and they were like i already tried to tell them to add this and they said they'll never do it so i did it myself

87
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:55,340
crazy so i was like oh well that seems kind of silly but now we're back in the kitchen yeah and then it seemed like they had their shit together until like you know like i was gonna fucking download the game like two days before and then i was like why does this just say it's 2025 it is what do you mean it is 2025

88
00:10:58,400 --> 00:12:09,620
the date of like um of when it's gonna show up so i just got so confused i was like we did it not tell us the release date why the fuck did we organize this collab on saturday like no there is yeah there was a release date and then it disappeared yeah he posted an update it was like something there was like a some bug with his build and so steam rejected it yeah like i had to look it up on because i was like trying to find like dev's fucking social media platform and his only social media platform was tick tock for some reason okay but i find so many games on tick tock okay like this game i found it on tick tock was he using his real voice or was he using the ai voiceover i have to know i don't remember just the text it was like this game is gonna be delayed because they don't check games on the weekend i was like yeah gross um we might need a swap game we're in trouble yeah god forbid steam staff have the weekends off wait wait wait so does that mean like they didn't bother like

89
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:54,180
uploading their builds in advance they apparently uploaded it on thursday or so like late night at thursday and then so then they're like guys i don't think they're checking the games like they're like oh it takes like five days to approve a game and so they're like we i don't think they're gonna be able to finish checking the game like yeah oops oh well this looks fun too okay i finished my thumbnail if you finished putting hats on everybody yeah we all have hats yeah okay what does the thumbnail look like i want to see oh i posted it in discord it's really high effort oh yeah oh it looks good it looks good i actually couldn't tell yeah but the fact that they're filming completely differently

90
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,700
Your big ears!

91
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,240
Oh, I love your four-year look.

92
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,720
Oh, wow, I got new outfit debut, outfit upgrade.

93
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
I'll show the chat.

94
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,460
All right, who's going to make the server?

95
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,660
Who's going to host it?

96
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,320
Who's in the middle?

97
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,200
The regional manager.

98
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,620
Oh, I'm in the middle.

99
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,700
I could try.

100
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,660
Oh, yeah, so, yeah.

101
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,640
Okay, yeah, yeah.

102
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,640
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,660
Manager Mint also has like a nice flow to it.

104
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,860
Manager Minto.

105
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,540
Yeah, the regional.

106
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:37,620
I'm gonna cap the frame rate on this game because every like every one of these games that we play that's like early access and stuff is like hey what's optimization and if you don't cap the frame rate it just like eats your computer.

107
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,700
I didn't see an option.

108
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,860
Oh I just do it through the Nvidia control panel.

109
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,300
Oh wait there's there's like there's proximity chat here.

110
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,540
Wait there's push this up.

111
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,440
It says it's recommended too.

112
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,900
It says proximity is recommended.

113
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,220
Oh so we're doing the mute.

114
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,620
Okay I can't wait for the next cool I didn't realize we did that.

115
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,640
I didn't think that would mean me.

116
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,280
Every time.

117
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
Every time.

118
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
Wait, there's only push to talk.

119
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,060
You can't even do open mic.

120
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,480
What the fuck?

121
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,200
There's no open mic.

122
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,980
There's no open mic.

123
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,920
Wait, isn't there?

124
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,760
I've made it.

125
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,720
I'm gonna put that on my mouse button.

126
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,900
This is, wait, if I uncheck push to talk, maybe, maybe.

127
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,740
I'm gonna uncheck push to talk and see.

128
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,340
Alright, now I'm starting to send invites now.

129
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,680
I'm launching the game.

130
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,440
If I disappear, it's because I crashed.

131
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,020
I gotta... I just realized I have to unprivate my friends list so I can join your lobby.

132
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,580
I saw you though, but I don't see...

133
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,200
I don't see Lymo and I don't see Snuffy.

134
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,760
I'm still just launching the game.

135
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,780
Also, I'm on Invisible, so give me a minute.

136
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,500
Yeah, we don't... We don't want people to know what we're doing.

137
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,900
I bet you... She doesn't want people to know she's playing Orch Massage.

138
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,860
Sometimes I hear that Mint plays V Bridger.

139
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,540

00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,920

guys why would you think i don't have friends okay i did friends so you guys can probably find me searching for games no games found searching for games no games found me too uh what you can do is if you add vbridger to your private games on steam it won't show people you're playing it which will then make it so that it shows burger box oh you right-click it oh yeah on vbriger and steam be like right click is it properties oh hi this game yeah yeah oh wait and mark is private mark is mark is private yeah do you just hide it from yourself i love vbriger anymore mark is private okay now no one will ever know no one will know No.

143
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,820
This is where we have to, like, Steam has to actually restart, because it still says you're playing V Bridger, but...

144
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,740
Oh, uh-oh.

145
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,740
I have to restart.

146
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,520
I may see.

147
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,660
Maybe Lyme should be the regional manager.

148
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,860
I think Lyme is way more capable than me.

149
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
How much, like, ping do you really need to play this game?

150
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,080
It'll be fine, man.

151
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,180

Okay.

154
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,100
I'm not capable.

155
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,560

173
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,540
The shit doesn't run in the past 10 years.

174
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,920
Oh my God, we all just got like, how many other snoozes do you know?

No, Michael, you want to be new.

178
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,700
Oh my gosh, this has a weird name.

179
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,600
The sensitivity is so high in this game.

180
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,380
It really is.

181
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,940
I have to turn everything so far down.

182
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,180
Yeah.

183
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,880
What's the, oh my gosh, I don't know.

184
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,620
Oh my God.

185
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,400
Now it's way too low.

186
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,680
Welcome to Snuffy.

187
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,340
Sloppies.

188
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,500
We have franchised into space.

189
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,280
I like the zoom.

190
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,240
I like zooming out on everybody's face.

191
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,140
What am I doing?

192
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,000
What am I doing?

193
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,120
What are you doing?

194
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,760
One through seven.

195
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,020
Oh!

196
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,700

197
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,260

Yay!

200
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,520
Sloppies in space.

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,060
I played the two of us that you know was actually on.

202
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,480

Guys, do not go into the mirror and say Bloody Mary, please.

207
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,800
Don't go into the bathroom at three.

208
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,220
Let's do it.

209
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,520
We'll watch from here.

210
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,620
Here, watch, watch, watch.

211
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,540
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.

212
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,220
Oh.

213
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,120
Oh.

214
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,560
Voice activation betrays you again.

215
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,220
No!

216
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,240
Oh, hold on.

217
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,060
Bloody Mary.

218
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,840
Bloody Mary.

219
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,760
Bloody Mary.

220
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
What happened?

221
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,100
Maybe it's only once.

222
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,060
Why are you all over?

223
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
way over here.

224
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,480
That was so scary though.

225
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,100
You go, you do it.

226
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,980
Snoopy, try it again.

227
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,880
Yeah, this is stuffy.

228
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,320
You did it.

229
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,020
Okay, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.

230
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,680
And then I just turned around and there was like somebody in the hallway and they killed me.

231
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,380
Bloody Mary.

232
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,360
Oh, I don't know.

233
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,380
Do you think it was, do you think it was just a regular customer that came into the hallway?

234
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,580
It was my boss, he knew I was five times in the bathroom.

235
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,500
The devs hit the blow up command.

236
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,080
It's this one.

237
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,680
The boss was like, hey, hey, this is it.

238
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,860
Bloody Mary, bloody Mary, bloody Mary.

239
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,780
Maybe it's only once per game.

240
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,980
Yeah, maybe it's one.

241
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,180
Yeah, we gotta wait for day two.

242
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,920
Okay, so, take a new order for my customer.

243
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,020
Ah!

244
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,660
Who killed me?

245
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,800
How did I die?

246
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,130
Oh, you just can't sleep on your blood.

247
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,390
Oh, oh.

248
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,070
Oh.

249
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,810
Because my helmet is getting cracked, guys.

250
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,250
Oh, yeah, I broke my helmet.

251
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,670
Whoa, that's my body!

252
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,410
Are you dead?

253
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,730
Me's dead, we haven't even started the work day.

254
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,550
When can I die?

255
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,190
It's the easiest work day of my life.

256
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,370
You can't come back until the next day.

257
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,750
So, oh.

258
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,750
Okay.

261
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,120
Look at this shit.

262
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,960
We're just printing these out.

263
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,920
We've got to wash it.

264
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,040
Yeah, be careful, Liz.

265
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,060
This comes with the sloppy move.

266
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,860
Guys, I think Nimmy is not talking so much.

267
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,680
She might be nervous or shy.

268
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,500
We're kind of, we're kind of, where the sloppies are a little crazy.

269
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,540
Yeah, she's dead until the next day.

270
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,160
Doki, what is this?

271
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,380
Look at that.

272
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,740
Oh, look at these.

273
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:19,840
Whack it.

274
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,520
Whack it.

275
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,400
Oh, Doki just died.

276
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,700
I can...

277
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,760
Can you hear me, Doki?

278
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,640
Yeah, I can hear you.

279
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,600
Who would have thought...

280
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,180
If you whacked it, you ate my fat.

281
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,320
Maybe we're serving them spider burgers.

282
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,320
I whacked it and it fought back.

283
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,360
Oh, who would have thought it would do that?

284
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,520
I see.

285
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,200
Who would have thought it would self-defense?

286
00:25:49,400 --> 00:26:17,860
like yeah that's crazy yeah it's insane how dare they fight back like you did not know who i am you should turn her into a burger okay you're gonna get thrown into the you're gonna get thrown into the meat grinder yeah we got we're running out of burger meat this is the easiest work day of our lives we haven't even started the work day it's just easier to carry

287
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
Okay, now we gotta see if we can actually put them on a burger.

288
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,020
Like, did you kill the spiders yet?

289
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,480
Because I have a gun.

290
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,220
No, we probably should still be watching.

291
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,820
Luffy carrying your head around.

292
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,880
I'm watching Nimmy carry your head around.

293
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,500
I feel like this game needed a tutorial, but we're just...

294
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,420
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

295
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,260
There's gotta be something we can do with it.

296
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,380
Luffy is the tutorial, but we're not paying attention.

297
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,580
There's a start the work day by using the switch.

298
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,880
There's a switch!

299
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,920
Oh, Jesus, it's coming down.

300
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,180
There's a lot of hiccups.

301
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,300
And we don't love these.

302
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,280
Do we have the order slips?

303
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,340
Oh my god, please, start the work, just start the work day, guys.

304
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,520
I like the Halloween decorations.

305
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,200
It's fun.

306
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,780
Oh, is there?

307
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,440
Okay.

308
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,220
Yeah, there's like pumpkins and stuff.

309
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,520
Don't lose your head, Doki.

310
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,880
No, they're just waiting.

311
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,160
They're too old.

312
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,720
Oh my god, they finally...

313
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,600
Oh my god, they finally...

314
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,320
Oh, they can make us a freaking logo.

315
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,920
Snuffy, no!

316
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,280
She's distracted.

317
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,240
She's not distracted by it.

318
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,140
Oh my god.

319
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,240
Like, I'm going through the caves.

320
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,800
Like, I'm going to start the work day, and then she found the PC.

321
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,220
She can't help it, she's a V-Tuber.

322
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,040
I got this.

323
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,840
I'm gonna draw this.

324
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,640
Oh my god!

325
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,860
I just saw her.

326
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,500
Oh my god, she got me!

327
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,000
I just saw Lymu got me!

328
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,480
I don't think anybody's- Yeah, yeah.

329
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,420
Yeah.

330
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,680
Lymu's actually trying to work.

331
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,260
I upped overall volume for everyone.

332
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,200
You what?

333
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,280
I upped all the time.

334
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,300
Look!

335
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,260
I made burger meat!

336
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,760
He was like, make sure to up up meat and stuff me.

337
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,560
I was like, gotcha.

338
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,260
How is the audio for people, everybody?

339
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:24,720
I'm drawing.

340
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,740
Yeah, how is the audio, everyone?

341
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,940
I'm the social media guy.

342
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:29,860
Liebu!

343
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,360
Liebu!

344
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,160
Pull the- Do we want to start the day because they might revive them?

345
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,000
No, but wait, what about my picture though?

346
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,660
I need to- Oh, are you actually drawing?

347
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,000
Okay.

348
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,500
Yeah, yeah, no, I actually am.

349
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:40,880
No, wait.

350
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,760
It's gonna be good.

351
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,820
Start the day!

352
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,180
We're never gonna play this game because we're gonna be dead on it.

353
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,560
We're just like watch Friday.

354
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,340
You know what?

355
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,020
We are a watch party with Duck Roots right now.

356
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,500
Yeah.

357
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,940
This is our watch party.

358
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,740
Oh, I can mute, Doki.

359
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,900
Bye.

360
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,050
Everybody's at their max.

361
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,970
I think it's just also the...

362
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,550
I think it's up the overall volume and then we turn people down individually.

363
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,670
Oh, yeah, yeah.

364
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,950
Okay, Limeo can turn on the fucking jukebox but not start the day.

365
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:29,970
Bloody Mary.

366
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,470
Bloody Mary.

367
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,030
Bloody Mary.

368
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,050
Bloody Mary.

369
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,110
Bloody Mary.

370
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,210
Oh, go Nimmy, go!

371
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,810
Oh, Mimi, dance.

372
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,350
This is our purgatory.

373
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,230
You know, get everyone nice and relaxed for their burgers.

374
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,990
I feel like I should be like, you know, free.

375
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:21,930
like I don't know just talking over this like hey girl this is this we are truly this is it this is where we're stuck forever I'm stuck watching fast food workers figure out how to fucking start the day just open the store you know for the burgers

376
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,630
Burgatory.

377
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,970
This is actual real fame.

378
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,390
We've got cup lids and cups.

379
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,830
And sheemes.

380
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,010
Just logo.

381
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:31,990
Sheemes.

382
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,070
They haven't even brought us up at all.

383
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,270
They completely have forgotten about.

384
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,820
Burgatory.

385
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,980
Yeah, we're in Burgatory.

386
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,680
Wait, I can't hear you anymore, Doki.

387
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,820
Do you guys see what the logo is?

388
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,040
Oh, now I can.

389
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,880
I just know.

390
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,940
Where, where, oh, no, I see it, I think.

391
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,060
Oh, I see the logo.

392
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,000
It's beautiful, though, right?

393
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,140
It's beautiful.

394
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,680
I'm gonna start the day.

395
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,340
She's starting the day.

396
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,760
No, that's the wrong button.

397
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,000
That's the wrong button.

398
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,260
There you go.

399
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,300
Progress the day further to close up early.

400
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:15,880
Are they back?

401
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,960
Thank you, guys.

402
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,320
We just, just end the day.

403
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,460
End the day.

404
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,220
Make the order and deliver it to a customer.

405
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,680
Wait, I think if they all...

406
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,640
Or we could just try and do it.

407
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,060
Because we're not going to do it very well.

408
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,860
There's a guy!

409
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,860
I'll just give it like a quick go, I guess.

410
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
They'll kill each other.

411
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,220
Let's see.

412
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,360
Start assembling a burger by placing a bottom bun.

413
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,940
Okay, I don't think you're going to do that.

415
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,540
We're still watching.

416
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,260
Wait, which one's the burger?

417
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,180
There we go.

418
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,440
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

419
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,380
Finish by adding a top bun and pressing...

420
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:50,980
Oh, there's a guy!

421
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,660
Look how cute he is!

422
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,580
This is like...

423
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,700
Oh!

424
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,240
There's the customer.

425
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:56,700
Oh!

426
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,640
back if you know what's good for you.

427
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,520
Why is he so rude?

428
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,600
I think every time you hit the bell, you're going to get a customer.

429
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,420
Hold on, what's your order?

430
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,660
This is our tutorial video, Mint.

431
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,540
We're literally watching tutorial video.

432
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,720
Oh, wait, I just...

433
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Oh, my God!

434
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,760
She didn't say...

435
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,340
Why does he have anger issues?

436
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,460
You should let the customer service job be me.

437
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,220
You should be the customer.

438
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,160
Oh, do me!

439
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,720
You should stay back if you know what to do.

440
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,240
Hello, welcome to Burgatory.

441
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,020
Welcome to Burgatory, Nimi.

442
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,140
I'm going to take your order.

443
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,340
Thank you.

444
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,820
Thanks.

445
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,900
That was something.

446
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,040
That was something.

447
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,560
I think the burger was interesting.

448
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,600
Then and I will be watching all three of you trying to start the day.

449
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,600
I fear my army.

450
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,680
Oh, here we go.

451
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,680
There's the reader.

452
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,780
One is three burgers and that's it.

453
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,620
But we just didn't have an orientation.

454
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,860
It's not our fault.

455
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,660
Our original manager didn't give us an orientation.

456
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,500
Oh.

457
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,480
Exactly.

458
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,300
Come on, Stuffy, you can do it.

459
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,880
It's not our fault.

460
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,520
There you go.

461
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,880
Is that guy still just walking around?

462
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,020
Oh, my God!

463
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,820
Yeah, it is.

464
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,980
I think he's just walking around till he gets his burger.

465
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,420
I'll be right back, my little ghost.

466
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:13,980
Okay.

467
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,860
All right.

468
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,420
Hi, Stuffy.

469
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,720
Welcome to Burgatory.

470
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,960
Yeah, welcome to Burgatory.

471
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,060
Can we take your order?

472
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,740
I thought you guys would come back to life when it started.

473
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,400
I'm sorry.

474
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,100
It's okay.

475
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,440
We're just chilling.

476
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,480
Yeah, no, we come back to life on the next day.

477
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,480
I think Lymu should just die though.

478
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,360
Die, Lymu.

479
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:35,540
Die.

480
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
Yeah, Lymu should just die.

481
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,200
There's no way she can...

482
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,760
She's gonna shoot the customer.

483
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,580
Do it.

484
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,640
Kill him.

485
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,280
She's getting too many customers!

486
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,300
There's a line!

487
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,620
Oh, you're right, you're right.

488
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,800
She's gotta weed them out.

489
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,900
She killed him!

490
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,560
Oh, my God.

491
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,280
She just killed a customer.

492
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,340
That's not very Snuffy up here.

493
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,980
What just happened?

494
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,800
Oh, she slipped.

495
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,680
Oh, she slipped.

496
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,140
She slipped on her, uh, she slipped on Snuffy's blood.

497
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
Hey, Snuffy, okay?

498
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,600
Guys?

499
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,100
Hello?

500
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,700
She's still taking order.

501
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,000
I haven't figured out how to make a burger, man.

502
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,980
Okay, Limu is our tutorial.

503
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,980
Yeah, this is our tutorial video.

504
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,960
What about the guy she killed, though?

505
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,880
Like, what do you do about him?

506
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,820
Yeah, what do you do about him?

507
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,220
You gotta make him a burger.

508
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,100
Still?

509
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,280
Wait, maybe she could use the customer to make more burger meat.

510
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,200
Oh, yeah.

511
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,380
Wait, but she got the meat from the bugs downstairs.

512
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,140
Okay, whatever.

513
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,020
Yeah, yeah.

514
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,040
Let's see.

515
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,340
So we have a box of birds.

516
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,080
Oh, my fucking nabby!

517
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,740
What did she slip off?

518
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,700
Can we figure out how to make a burger yet?

519
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,780
Yeah, she's still trying to figure it out.

520
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,680
She shot a custom room, but we don't talk about that.

521
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,840
She shot a custom room.

522
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,520
All right, let's see.

523
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,320
She's definitely the manager, then.

524
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,200
That's the respawn device.

525
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:09,900
Yeah, respawn.

526
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,020
I'm going to call her, but there's unruly custom rooms.

527
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,320
Oh, true, true, true.

528
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:13,980
Yeah, that's what we got.

529
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,420
It's like, I want to talk to your manager, and we said limo with a gun.

530
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,180
Wait, what's happening?

531
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,620
Oh, my God, you could have been like...

532
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:26,160
You destroyed our bodies, and we could have come back at any time.

533
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:34,970
um we're probably we're probably we're probably dead oh we're probably dead i haven't figured out how to open the burger box yet

534
00:35:42,680 --> 00:36:02,020
don't be difficult get in the fucking tune oh it's the res the two look it's the res i think it might be a recharge maybe there's a rose yeah apparently we grinded your guys's body We'll never come back again.

535
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,700
We need to sell some burgers.

536
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,740
Oh, it costs money to revive.

537
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,100
Oh.

538
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,500
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

539
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,180
Oh.

540
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:17,300
I like how that one brought Mimi back and she's like, okay, figure out the burgers.

541
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,420
Oh, that's cute.

542
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,460
Oh, there's our orders up there.

543
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:50,080
I mean, I like how she basically revived Mimi just to delegate her fast just like real like hard time work i mean it's like it seems to be working so you know what actually i'm going to do that who's frying the the mate maybe wait oh maybe they're in here hold up what about in here oh we got a patty fridge

544
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:02,620

545
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,300
Okay, perfect.

546
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,120
Where's my burger?

547
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,080
Pickles.

548
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,760
How do you know when it's done?

549
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,560
You just, oh, okay.

550
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,880
It's turning around and seeing Nibby.

551
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,780
I think it changed color, right?

552
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,800
Yeah, it turned like less red.

553
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,720
All right.

554
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,660
Patty.

555
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,120
Patty cake, pat.

556
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:24,380
Oh.

557
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,940
Oh my God, I found the little beef.

558
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,980
Oh my God, that's so immersive.

559
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,280
I love it.

560
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,800
It is, it's so immersive.

561
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,800
Oh, really?

562
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,040
All right, so we need someone to do the fries.

563
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,480
I think me will be perfect for fries.

564
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,700
And then I can look at the food.

565
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,280
So where is it?

566
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,520
Shit, what number is it?

567
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,780
I want to take the other one.

568
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,140
It's fine.

569
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,860
Oh, yeah, yeah.

570
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,300
But it's going to be the front because it will be Squidward at the front.

571
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,340
They're leaving!

572
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,080
We could be Squidward.

573
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,420
They're leaving!

574
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,140
It's right here, man.

575
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,840
What is going on with that man?

576
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:01,980
Yeah.

577
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,140
The guy that died yet.

578
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,840
He looks like he's like banging his hand on the floor.

579
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,160
Like he's like, oh damn it, I'm just not in a burger.

580
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,360
Nimmy's gonna put him in the blender.

581
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,220
Wait, is she?

582
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,040
She's putting him in the blender.

583
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,340
We were running out of meat.

584
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,560
She's gonna revive him.

585
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,480
No, I think she's blending him.

586
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,060
Yeah, I think he's blending him for more meat.

587
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,980
We're running out.

588
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,080
This is a good game.

589
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,940
Here you go.

590
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,260
Why did they just...

591
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,320
They should just throw themselves into the blender and then end the day.

592
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,460
Where do you get the meat from?

593
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,020
Oh, it comes from the right side.

594
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,600
Oh, I see it.

595
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,040
Here you go.

596
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,340
He was huge.

597
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,360
Oh, he gave two boxes.

598
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:49,900
Oh.

599
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,980
Actually, like, the cheat code.

600
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,860
Because we don't have to pay for more meat.

601
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,200
Oh, my God.

602
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,060
Yeah, but we need more customers.

603
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,400
We have to pay for the drugs.

604
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,260
Wait, no, I heard someone.

605
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:35,880
the hell where the fuck oh god this is awful yeah thank you we haven't figured out where you went into the place wait that makes so much sense put him in the grinder too yeah yeah exactly unlimited me wait how do you restock the meat oh you can't put it in the fridge unfortunately the words has gotten around that we suck and nobody's coming do we close the store our yelp for these The trimming is so pathetic.

606
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,380
It's so pathetic.

607
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,080
So sassy, yeah.

608
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,660
Okay, let's close up early.

609
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:41,720
Okay.

610
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,960
Oh my god!

611
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,080
Oh, we're here!

612
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,560
We walked in.

613
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,240
Finally.

614
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:47,800
Stuffy?

615
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,360
Wait!

616
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,540
Stuffy?

617
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,060
Wait, Stuffy?

618
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,180
Wait, there's Stuffy right here!

619
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,340
There's a...

620
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,800
I guess we gotta put her in the grinder.

621
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,880
That's my second grinder.

622
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,480
I have your head here.

623
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,100
Gotta grind her up.

624
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,070
How do I throw?

625
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,270
There she goes.

626
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,730
Well, she's just made of bolts.

627
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,290
She's...

628
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:21,690
She's...

629
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,590
She'll be fine.

630
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,870
She's grinding.

631
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:24,490
What's this do?

632
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,340
I can't touch it.

633
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,830
Alright, guys.

634
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,610
Let's go.

635
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,060
I'm ready to serve!

636
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,160
We don't want a reputation for having frozen burgers.

637
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,060
Get to work, get to work!

638
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,140
I'm cooking up burgers!

639
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,760
Oh, hello!

640
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,780
New order number eight!

641
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,520
Oh, would we like to be the front of house, Minty?

642
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,400
Yeah, I'll be the front of house.

643
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,740
You like to promise not to put burgers in covers anymore?

644
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,060
Uh, no, I- I- I- There are no covers to put the burgers in.

645
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,060
And what the fuck is that?

646
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,560
Cheese?

647
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,360
Is that cheese?

648
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,020
That looks like cheese.

649
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,060
I mean, if it's yellow, it's...

650
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,580
Space cheese.

651
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,540
And some fries and a soda.

652
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:15,960
Yep.

653
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,980
New customer coming in.

654
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,800
Oh, I got you.

655
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,260
Hello.

656
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,120
Why don't you have small things?

657
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,120
Oh, two new customers.

658
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,400
Two new customers.

659
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,200
Let me see how they're feeling today.

660
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,300
How are you feeling?

661
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,040
Okay, he doesn't say anything.

662
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:30,880
How are you?

663
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,460
How are you?

664
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,140
Oh, okay.

665
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,720
They're angry.

666
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,020
They're hungry!

667
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,480
They're hangry!

668
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,100
Oh, thank you.

669
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:46,900
Order number eight?

670
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,280
Order number eight.

671
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,240
Oh, he's coming, he's coming.

672
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,460
Order number eight.

673
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:57,760
Ah!

674
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,880
I'm sorry.

675
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,900
Number nine is two burgers and some tomatoes.

676
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,240
I got the...

677
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Did he pay for that, or...

678
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,930
Oh, we got Jason coming in.

679
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:19,790
Hello, hello?

680
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,570
Hey, what did he say?

681
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,950
I'm getting tired of your gawking, yeah.

682
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,210
Maybe he doesn't like to be looked at.

683
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,490
Wait, we have two number nines?

684
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,270
They will kill you if you don't listen to them.

685
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:32,970
Yeah, I know.

686
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,770
One guy punched me already.

687
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,490
I'm making order number 12.

688
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,210
Here you go, Mint.

689
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,070
Here's another order.

690
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:40,970
Number 12?

691
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,090
Number nine.

692
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,850
Wait, is this 10 or nine?

693
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,190
Wait, wait, I have the drink.

694
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,330
Did you get...

695
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:49,790
Oh, hold on.

696
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,130
Here you go.

697
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:51,910
Oh, oops.

698
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,010
Oh my god, did you do?

699
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,390
There's no drink for that one.

700
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,790
Number nine, number nine.

701
00:42:59,250 --> 00:42:59,970
Is it number nine?

702
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:01,470
Blip-blop.

703
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:02,630
Blip-blop.

704
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:05,950
Blip-blop.

705
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:06,770
That's what he said.

706
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,010
He was happy.

707
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,530
He was happy.

708
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,670
Don't look at that guy.

709
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,890
Don't look at that guy.

710
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,930
No, he said it was fine!

711
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:15,750
He said it was fine!

712
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,950
Are they fighting already?

713
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,530
No?

714
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,890
No, everything's okay.

715
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,670
Oh, see, they'll punch you, they'll punch you down!

716
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,910
Are you okay?

717
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,970
Oh, we have dirty trays.

718
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:32,890
Where do we put this?

719
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:33,230
I wonder.

720
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,490
Oh, I put it here, maybe?

721
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,250
Oh, dirty tray.

722
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:41,670
Okay.

723
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,750
We gotta clean up.

724
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:44,700
We gotta clean up.

725
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,730
In the grinder.

726
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:51,720
Where does it go?

727
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:53,230
Oh.

728
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,540
Oh.

729
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,110
A sound.

730
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:10,690
Fossilade.

731
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,550
I'll take that.

732
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,710
This is order number...

733
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:17,970
Uh...

734
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,690
I didn't make any more patties.

735
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,130
What's the order number 10?

736
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,590
Order number 10!

737
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,840
Somebody over here.

738
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,740
Which one of you?

739
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,420
Order 10.

740
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,000
Thanks!

741
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,980
Just what I wanted!

742
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,960
Blip-lop, blip-lop!

743
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:39,960
He was satisfied 100% Oh really?

744
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:40,560
Yeah.

745
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,020
You baby!

746
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:42,960
Yeah!

747
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,640
Our side of fries.

748
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,120
Our rent is due tomorrow and we covered 14% of it.

749
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,620
Don't think...

750
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,700
We're at a 2% net gain for rent.

751
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,000
Thanks.

752
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,180
Maybe we can do it.

753
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,700
I got order number 11.

754
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,420
Where did he go?

755
00:44:59,460 --> 00:44:59,980
He's over here.

756
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,600
He's over here.

757
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:01,940
All right.

758
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,760
Hello, sir.

759
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,380
Here's order number 11.

760
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,940
That's not what he wanted.

761
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,380
He is so...

762
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,480
What did you do?

763
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,340
It was the wrong order.

764
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,360
I can't pay minimum wage.

765
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,280
I like this thing.

766
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,040
Yeah, I wish dishes in real life were like this.

767
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,580
I wish we had dishes in real life.

768
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,580
At all.

769
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:37,520
Oh!

770
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,490
What happened to me?

771
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,270
Watch out!

772
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,190
I'm moving so slow.

773
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,490
What did I trip on?

774
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,870
We don't go close early.

775
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,230
Maybe someone will come in.

776
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,930
We'll get the rush.

777
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,490
Yeah, we're at 38%.

778
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,390
We're almost there.

779
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,010
Yeah.

780
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,910
We still have five minutes.

781
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,590
To attract customers.

782
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,230
Okay.

783
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,290
Yeah, oh, wait, Nimi, you can dance in front of the jukebox.

784
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,050
I said we could take out our own.

785
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,550
We're just in debt now, guys.

786
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,170
No worries.

787
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:07,750
No worries.

788
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:08,490

I don't think anyone removed it.

816
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,650
This is for spanking the naughty customer.

817
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:55,310
Where are they?

abstinence.

831
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,950
We have 20 seconds left.

Or is this the imposter?

835
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:30,170
Wait.

836
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,650
No, that's Snuffy right away.

837
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,290
Oh, that's Snuffy's old body.

838
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,590
Yeah, yeah, that's your old body.

Alright.

Zero.

841
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:42,830
I'm closing.

842
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,970
The day is over!

843
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:45,870
Okay.

844
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,830
How do I put these in there?

845
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,770
We have day old burgers ready to go.

846
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:51,970
Oh.

847
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:55,230
Wait, how do I put the patty in here?

848
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,670
We think it's full and it's not working yet.

851
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:02,550

852
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:03,310

856
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:10,590
Nothing made me trip and it pissed him off.

857

He's not dead.

858
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:12,590
He's not dead.

859
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,350
Oh no, he's not sitting down.

860
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:18,910
We need to blow him up!

861
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:20,310
We need to blow him up!

862
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,830

863
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,410
Wait, where's the gun?

864
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,730
His reach is insane!

865
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:27,630

866
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,550

Let's get this.

872
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,070
This day started.

873
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:45,070
Two patties.

874
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:46,220
One tomato.

00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:48,710
One triple.

876
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:50,150
One triple.

877
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:51,670
Is someone working?

881
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,650
I'm placing a bottom bun.

882
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,240
Two patties.

883
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,890
I'm two trips away from dying.

884
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,670
If you go to the healing chair, it does just heal you.

885
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,490
Wait, there's a healing chair.

886
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,270
There's a healing.

887
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:10,970

888
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:12,590

890
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,330
Oh, wait, we got more people.

891
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,670
Okay, I'm doing 14.

892

One tomato.

893
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,640
Wait, where do we get tomato from?

894
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,720
Wait, is that pickle or is that tomato?

895
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:32,540
There's a spill.

896
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,260
There's a spill.

897
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,560

00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,280
There's one on the floor, but it's okay.

901
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,940
Where do I get the tray from?

902
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:42,600
It's still good.

903
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,460
Are you guys here?

904
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,940

Wait, all they wanted to do was buy candy!

952
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,230
We spent all our money on fries.

Wait, why did we look...

954
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:42,950
Did you spend $200 on the machine?

955
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,150
Because our renters went down by like 20%.

956
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,250
What happens to our rent?

957
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,410
I might have spent money on fries.

958
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:49,430

1026
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:41,130
Wait, did I grab him?

1027
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:44,070
Stop, stop, stop!

1028
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:46,010
He's so slippery!

1029
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:48,630
I'm putting these back.

1030
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:49,970
I guess that's what...

1031
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,570
We found out what happens when we leave a bunch of burgers around.

1032
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:53,250
Yeah!

1033
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:55,630
The space rats.

1034
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:56,530
That makes sense.

1035
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:57,690
Alien rats.

1036
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,230
Duh!

1037
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,390
Yeah, of course.

1038
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:03,570
I think we gotta accept our fate.

1039
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:04,150
I do.

1040
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,030
I don't... I don't...

1041
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,970
How do we keep losing money?

1042
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:10,750
It's the fucking customer stop coming after about three minutes.

1043
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:11,390
Right!

1044
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:15,110
I think we gotta work fast, I'm pretty sure.

1045
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:15,490
Yeah.

1046
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,750
So we gotta have a healthy stream of customers.

1047
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,610
Here we go.

1048
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,190
Wait, what's salute?

1049
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:22,590
Not that one.

1050
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:26,290
I think sloppy court's gonna send in a representative and fire us.

1051
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:27,910
Send, go fake.

1052
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:29,890
Oh, you guys are, oh, here we go.

1053
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:30,210
Oh.

1054
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,850
Oh, why is he a capitalized?

1055
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:34,790
Thanks you for your service.

1056
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:35,750
Oh, random things are capitalized.

1057
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:36,150
That's fine.

1058
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:41,470
Brickbox Incorporated is eligible to initiate a self-destruct protocol installed upon the sign of the owner's code.

1059
01:00:42,790 --> 01:01:17,110
contract oh oh we just happened we're dying one at a time not it no no no not it not it no i'm safe i'm fine oh wait that's dokey's feelings use of company funds meant for the operating cost of the diamond not it not it suspicions of industrial espionage being conducted by a single employee working in the same establishment as you uses or isn't capable of paying for said services hampering with

1060
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:26,120
this is funny i like the the individual death that was a narc i guess yeah

1061
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:54,440
your diner you served 16 orders 67 percent of the lover orders were acceptable oh my god he suffered 10 casualties that seems about right yeah yeah But it says zero customers lost their lives.

1062
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,740
So shooting that guy didn't count.

1063
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:58,300
Yeah.

1064
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,500
Uh, I think, do we get invited again?

1065
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,820
Do we invite again?

1066
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,760
But yeah, was the sound better now?

1067
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,060
Oh, I think everybody still has everybody to zero.

1068
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,040
La la la la la la la la la.

1069
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:27,800
Oh!

1070
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,040
There it is from LimeLicious.

1071
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,480
Hello team!

1072
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,280
Go save Bloody Mary at the window again.

1073
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,560
Oh yeah, it's true, let's hear it.

1074
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,080
I'm gonna watch him here.

1075
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,840
We're going for Snuffy though.

1076
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,520
You wanna do the honors, Nimmy?

1077
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,510
Wait, I can't hear you.

1078
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:53,690
Oh no.

1079
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:54,950

Oh wait, oh, I know what happened.

1081
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,650
I gotta reset the lobby, hold on.

1082
01:02:58,810 --> 01:02:59,810
Oh, just kidding.

1083
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:04,030
Reset?

1084
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,610
Oh, there we go.

1085
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:11,610
Oh, Snuffy had an issue with her invite too, so it's fine.

1086
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,790
NIMMUTED!

1087
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:14,290
NIMMUTED!

1088
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:21,510
I feel- I think I'm gonna make it- NIMMED still seems quiet to me, so I'm gonna lower everybody and then, like, turn the overall game up.

1089
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:27,310
Oh, oopsie!

1090
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:29,630
NIMMED, can you talk?

1091
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:30,690

Yeah, we can hear you.

1094
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:32,830

1095
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:33,110

I just got knocked off.

1099
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:42,010
He keeps resetting your mic.

1100
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,430
Wait, we heard him die after night or whatever.

1101
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,070

They live.

1103
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:47,830
We die from other means.

1104
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,310
It keeps resetting your mic.

1105
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:50,210
Yeah, from other means.

1106
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:51,910
Yeah, we die.

1107
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:53,910
Yeah, we can't even go back to the passenger car.

1108
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,650
My sloppy, my sloppy employee.

1109
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:09,090
Uh-oh.

1110
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:10,250
Yes, okay.

1111
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:10,890
No?

1112
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:11,730
Okay.

1113
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:13,050
Alright.

1114
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:15,210
We're ready.

1115
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,850
They're coming in.

1116
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:18,210
And they're coming in!

1117
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:23,470
New order on the clock!

1118
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:24,510
What do we got?

1119
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:25,170
What do we got?

1120
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:28,530
Two burgs, a drink, and pickles.

1121
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:31,270
I'll get the bun.

1122
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:32,490
One bun.

1123
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:33,850
I'm making fries.

1124
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:37,850
No fries on this one.

1125
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:38,110
Nope.

1126
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:38,810
Yeah.

1127
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:41,070
We don't cook too many patties this time.

1128
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,410
Because we don't want the space rats to come in.

1129
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:45,390
Okay.

1130
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:46,710
Are you making the burger?

1131
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:48,290
How do I do it?

1132
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:49,350
Oh, one person should...

1133
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:51,650
Oh, another order!

1134
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,450
Okay, I'm gonna make the burger then.

1135
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:55,870
I'll make one too.

1136
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:57,530
Oh, just three old patties.

1137
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,650
I'm making order number one.

1138
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,270
Um, how do I make a patty?

1139
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:06,070
Oh, you make them here.

1140
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:06,870
There's some over here.

1141
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:08,690
Oh, you make them here.

1142
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:09,710
Oops.

1143
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:11,010
Oh.

1144
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,070
I got more patties.

1145
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:16,410
I got a soda.

1146
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:18,910
Shody.

1147
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,510
Okay, one.

1148
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:22,250
Two.

1149
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:23,210
It was three?

1150
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:24,250
Three.

1151
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,110
There's someone waiting to have their order taken.

1152
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:27,210
Oh, I'm coming.

1153
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,850
Oh, you set the vibe for the customers.

1154
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:31,970
Yeah.

1155
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:33,650
Three?

1156
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:38,030
I'm working on it.

1157
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:38,890
I got it.

1158
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:41,470
Are you doing two or three?

1159
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,210
I was doing three.

1160
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:44,950
Oh, wait, they're the same.

1161
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:45,490
Almost.

1162
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:47,790
I'm doing with three.

1163
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:48,730
Okay, I'll do two then.

1164
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:49,930
New logo.

1165
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,250
Wait, we have a new logo.

1166
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,290
Did you not say my logo?

1167
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:56,430
Oh.

1168
01:06:58,490 --> 01:06:59,410
Number two.

1169
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:01,990
Number two coming up.

1170
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:02,590
Is it you?

1171
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:05,090
I don't know what I can do to it.

1172
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:05,570
What the?

1173
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:06,850
You're welcome.

1174
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:07,490
Support.

1175
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:08,670
Morally, support.

1176
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,190
Yeah.

1177
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:11,790
I'm trying new logos.

1178
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,110
I'm going to do ordering for four.

1179
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:15,870
Okay, I'll do five.

1180
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:19,010
B3.

1181
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:20,010
All right.

1182
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:21,190
Are you okay?

1183
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:21,910
Wait, snap me.

1184
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,030
We need more patties.

1185
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:24,790
Can you go kill an ant for us?

1186
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:25,910
Or kill customers?

1187
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,690
Either word.

1188
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,550
Kill customers or kill ants.

1189
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,890
Wait, I gotta pick up these orders too.

1190
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:32,650
Yeah, yeah, pick it up.

1191
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:33,810
I'm flipping that.

1192
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:34,810
You mean our patties really?

1193
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:35,370
We're already out?

1194
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:36,230
There's no way.

1195
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,390
I'm doing five.

1196
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:39,510
There's two freezer pools worth.

1197
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:40,050
What do you mean?

1198
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:42,030
No, I don't need five.

1199
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:45,430
Which one is five?

1200
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:47,490
Who's five?

1201
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:48,070
Who's five?

1202
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:49,010
Are you five?

1203
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,450
Okay, no, not my problem.

1204
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:53,770
Number five.

1205
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:55,290
Number five?

1206
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:55,770
Oh, gosh.

1207
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:56,730

1208
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:57,690
Oh, gosh.

01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:01,650
Flip-flop, flip-flop.

1210
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:03,790
Flip-flop, flip-flop.

1211
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,510
I'm already feeling the pressure, guys.

1212

1213
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:10,030
I'm going to crack.

1214
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,740
Why does that music sound like a...

1215
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:16,940
Urbanic theme?

1216
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,880

1222
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:01,720
It's okay!

1223
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,000
We're already 50%.

01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,100
I wish I could run faster.

1231
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,720
I'm doing order nine.

1232
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,280
Okay, I'll do order ten.

1235
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:25,520
Alright.

1236
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,460
More patties.

1237
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,300
Order up.

1238
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,680
Oh, I have to do it the whole time.

1239
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,620
We're doing it!

1240
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:42,500
We're doing it!

1241
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,560
One patty.

1242
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:45,620
And the cheese.

1243
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,320
We're gonna make so many people happy.

1244
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,740
Uh, no, we're not.

1245
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,210
Sophie!

1246
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:57,770
Sloppy.

1247
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,590
Oh, our logo changed once again.

1248
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:00,850
Okay, number 10.

1249
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:01,490
Number 10.

1250
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,870
Our social media manager made a new logo.

1251
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:04,770
Who are you?

1252
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:05,690
10.

1253
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:07,130
Ow!

1254
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:07,950
Ow!

1255
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:09,410
I'm sorry!

1256
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:10,610
Wait, what do I- Are you okay?

1257
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,490
That guy was out of line.

1258
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:14,630
He was out of this world, honestly.

1259
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:17,950
Look, you matter, okay?

1260
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,590
Like, even though we're fast food workers, we matter.

1261
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:24,270
I know, they just, these people have never worked a service job in their lives.

1262
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,830
I know!

1263
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:26,870
They just don't know how to treat anybody.

1264
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:33,470
Yeah, they think just because we're in service that we are lesser than them, that's so fucked up.

1265
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:34,970
It really is, man.

1266
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:40,230
Yeah, I think we have to make a much faster work with these patties.

1267
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,430
I wonder if we're going to make sure to get in there.

1268
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,650
We're going to take a bunch of patties now.

1269
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:45,470
No, no, no.

1270
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:48,130
Who cooked all these patties here?

1271
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:48,810
Uh-oh.

1272
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:50,710
Uh-oh.

1273
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:51,290
Uh-oh.

1274
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:51,890
Uh-oh.

1275
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:53,350
Somebody's in trouble.

1276
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:54,190
The rats are coming.

1277
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,870
It's okay.

1278
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:57,430
I'm hearing squeaks in the walls.

1279
01:10:58,670 --> 01:10:59,610
Put them back in the freezer.

1280
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:00,590
Put them back in the freezer.

1281
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,050
Dispose of them.

1282
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:02,990
No, wait.

1283
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:03,950
Don't dispose of them.

1284
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,620
Yeah, we're back there.

1285
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:35,300
it starts with rats and then grown men start coming into the kitchens and maybe maybe they start coming on the third day yeah yeah they show up on the third day customers don't know it won't hurt them is it bad to just call it like i feel like we're only at risk of like weird shenanigans happening uh we need to like wait a minute oh yeah we can find a burger meat we're still here Oh yeah,

1286
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:35,700
we do.

1287
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,540
Yeah, we need to restock.

1288
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:38,860
Yeah.

1289
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:48,590
Oh, and no, one time the mirror was showing, like, Snuffy just standing there.

1290
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:51,470
Go Snuffy.

1291
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:53,190
It's a mirror.

1292
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:58,490
I have nothing to attack with.

1293
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:59,990
I'm just here for moral support.

1294
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:01,290
Yeah.

1295
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:03,810
Okay, one down.

1296
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:04,510
I'll kill it.

1297
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:04,950
I'll get it.

1298
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:05,470
I'll grab it.

1299
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,430
Do you think they come back?

1300
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,220
Did she die?

1301
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,140
Oh, you good?

1302
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,960
No, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1303
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,560
Oh my god, do you take full damage?

1304
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,640
No, no, I thought he was also dead.

1305
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,800
I thought you got a double kill.

1306
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:23,200
Is there any more?

1307
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,340
Did we get more?

1308
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:31,250
Oh!

1309
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:32,110
It

1310
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:41,470
took the weapons.

1311
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:42,690
It did?

1312
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:45,290
No.

1313
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:46,030
Oh.

1314
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:47,410
It didn't.

1315
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:51,390
Wait, does it cost money?

1316
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:53,630
Is someone talking?

1317
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:58,850
But the rats, they're gonna love cold.

1318
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:02,790
I'm gonna go kill more more ants.

1319
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,260
There was just one other.

1320
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:09,820
I can get him.

1321
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,160
I'm a winner.

1322
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,580
Oh my gosh.

1323
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:14,280
Where did that come from?

1324
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,600
Buns from the heaven.

1325
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,620
Buns from the heaven!

1326
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,320
That's where all buns come from.

1327
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:23,180
True.

1328
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:26,940
Revenge!

1329
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,680
Is best served.

1330
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,560
Oh, there's more.

1331
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:31,560
Okay.

1332
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,520
That should be good, I think.

1333
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:36,820
Yeah.

1334
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,780
You got some more patties?

1335
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:41,100
Yeah, can you grab the ants that I just killed?

1336
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,820
Buns are from the heaven.

1337
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:50,300
This way.

1338
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:51,280
Hey.

1339
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:51,940
Hi.

1340
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,620
Nice shots, thank you.

1341
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,360
What was that sound?

1342
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:02,880
Did we get emails?

1343
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,600
Bung Dippo!

1344
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,400
Oh, we can buy stuff here.

1345
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,180
The bank.

1346
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,820
I hear rats!

1347
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:14,900
I hear rats!

1348
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,680
I hear rats!

1349
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,300
I heard rats.

1350
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,820
I heard rats.

1351
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:22,900
I heard squeaks.

1352
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,100
I really did.

1353
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:24,980
Are you okay?

1354
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,760
There was no rats.

1355
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:27,820
I heard.

1356
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,640
What do the rats tell you?

1357
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,340
No, they squeaked.

1358
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:33,060
You can hear them in the walls.

1359
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:33,900
I can't.

1360
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,540
I can hear them in the walls.

1361
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,460
They're in the walls.

1362
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,180
They said we should wear these glasses.

1363
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,800
We are the rats.

1364
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,380
Our statistics.

1365
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,260

They're watching you.

01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,480
They're watching you.

01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,980
It drifts in everywhere?

1563
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,060
I hear him.

1564
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,060
I hear him wandering.

1565
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,380
There's a guy getting angry out here.

1566
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,980
Uh-oh, they're starting to leave.

1567
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:57,700
Oh, no!

1568
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:02,320
What was that?

1569
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:03,860
I got the back.

1570
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:05,160
That monster, I think.

1571
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:06,040
Oh, you did?

1572
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:07,980
Maybe, well, I don't know.

1573
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,320
It's still leaking, but I shot it.

1574
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,960
I think one of their customers exploded.

1575
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:11,920
I don't know what happened.

1576
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,340
It's okay.

1577
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:13,640
I'm cleaning up after him.

1578
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:22,110
I'll clean up, too.

1579
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,270
Did anyone make you want to clean up?

1580
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:27,370
We're cleaning up.

1581
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,290
You're doing 27?

1582
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:28,610
Okay.

1583
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,150
He just leaked a little.

1584
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:30,610
It's okay.

1585
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:33,770
Here.

1586
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:35,010
I got fries here.

1587

1588
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:07,630
he's getting ready to leave.

1589
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,280
Seven, six.

1590
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:14,920
You will, you will, you will!

1591
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,520
Clutch, clutch, clutch, clutch, clutch, clutch, clutch.

1592
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,540
We just wanted to look- Yeah!

1593
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:23,080
He gave us two bones!

1594
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,320
Oh my gosh.

1595
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:27,060
Why did he look like- Would you like a dancer too?

1596
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,480
Here you go.

1597
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,060
I'm gonna buy some candy.

1598
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:40,220
Yeah.

1599
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,500
Wait, why did it laugh evilly?

1600
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:45,860
Wait, it's not me that I'm just blowing people up.

1601
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:50,260
If there's a monster in the vent, you had to, like, look for the goo drops and then shoot the vent that it was in.

1602
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:50,660
Oh.

1603
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,560
Oh, I said that.

1604
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:54,960
I said, like, a million times don't walk under the vents because there's Half-Life 1.

1605
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,740
My candy was yummy.

1606
01:25:58,460 --> 01:25:59,480
Wait, what the fuck?

1607
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,680
What in the fuck did that eat?

1608
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:01,780
I don't know.

1609
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:03,740
Skill issue.

1610
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,900
I gotta spend some of our money on ordering food because we're basically out.

1611
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,620
Oh, what a busy day.

1612
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:10,780
We got the day already?

1613
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:12,580
Oh, it is close.

1614
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,720
Are you guys ready to start the day?

1615
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,140
No, no, no, no, no.

1616
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,280
Order new stuff first?

1617
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,020
Yeah, we should restock.

1618
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:20,780
Wait, I'll make more soda.

1619
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,140
Oh, wait.

1620
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,760
The soda machine stops, too.

1621
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,240
Wait, what do we need, love?

1622
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,120
The soda machine out, too?

1623
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:26,400
No, no, no.

1624
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,520
It stops when the day is closed.

1625
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,860
Oh, so we just have a half soda yet?

1626
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:31,780
It's hard on hearing.

1627
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,380
Oh, no, never mind.

1628
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:33,840
I'm good.

1629
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:37,060
Okay, we need more pickles and lettuce.

1630
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,940
Well, we can order those online.

1631
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,660
I'll order pickles and lettuce.

1632
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,220
I've ordered the ingredients.

1633
01:26:43,740 --> 01:27:16,370

1635
01:27:24,670 --> 01:27:26,510
I don't think they can hear me.

1636
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:29,550
Have I had flash soda?

1637
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:30,210
Oh.

1638
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:31,790
Are you okay?

1639
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:33,670
There's a dead rat down there.

1640
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:34,050
Oh!

1641
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:35,270
Somebody can go get it.

1642
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:36,970
I'll go get it.

1643
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:40,710
Where?

1644
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,440
Oh, there's no dead rat.

1645
01:27:57,790 --> 01:27:59,870
I thought I heard something in the...

1646
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:01,490
I thought I heard something in the tunnels.

1647
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:03,090
But I didn't see what you shot.

1648
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:04,910
No, I didn't see it.

1649
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:06,190
He was all the way back.

1650
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:07,690
Oh, maybe that's why.

1651
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:09,450
Right here.

1652
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:10,670
Oh, you're so brave.

1653
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:14,010
Wait, I can't grab him.

1654
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:15,170
Maybe it wasn't a rat.

1655
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,450
I can't grab him.

1656
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:20,650
He's too far in there.

1657
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:25,130
Oh, I thought we were going to be able to explore the caves.

1658
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:26,530
Oh.

1659
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:28,290
Oh well.

1660
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:30,830
They'll respawn.

1661
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:32,490
It's food for themselves.

1662
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:33,830
Cannibalism.

1663
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:35,530
That's true for the ecosystem.

1664
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:36,270
Yeah.

1665
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:41,110
Too deep in the hole.

1666
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:48,500
Ah.

1667
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:49,540
Man.

1668
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:00,110
Get to work is what it says.

1669
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:00,590
Scary.

1670
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:00,930
Oh.

1671
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:03,370
Does it cost money to heal yourself?

1672
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:05,930
Not to heal, but to revive, yes.

1673
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:06,310
Oh, okay.

1674
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:07,350
So make sure you heal.

1675
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:09,450
I'm healing.

1676
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:15,990
Hi!

1677
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:18,970
Good morning, team!

1678
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:22,110
We got this team!

1679
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:23,770
All right, everybody, rise and shine.

1680
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:24,870
Let's go clock in.

1681
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,490
Yeah.

1682
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,390
Clock in, clock in, clock in.

1683
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:29,530
All right, who's working on the first one?

1684
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:31,250
I'm working on it.

1685
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:32,570
Could you make me a blue soda, please?

1686
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:34,050
Yes, I can.

1687
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:35,090
Thank you.

1688
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:35,750
Oh.

1689
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:37,530
The grub soda.

1690
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:37,830
Okay.

1691
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:41,510
Two soda, one patty, three legs.

1692
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:42,870
She'd be grubbing.

1693
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:44,290
Grub soda.

1694
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:47,170
Oh, is this Rob?

1695
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:48,890
I need to tell you.

1696
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:51,230
There's a grub soda right there for you.

1697
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:55,270
Friendly reminder to check your events before you walk under them, guys.

1698
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:56,010
Thank you.

1699
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:57,290
Order 28 going out.

1700
01:29:57,370 --> 01:29:58,310
For the first hazard.

1701
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:00,510
Let's do 29.

1702
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:01,690
I'll get the soda.

1703
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:02,910
Wait, what is that?

1704
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:03,490
Alright.

1705
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:04,510
Should I do 30?

1706
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:05,690
Is anybody working on 30?

1707
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:07,550
Nobody's working on 30 yet.

1708
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:08,090
You go for it.

1709
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:08,670
I got 30.

1710
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:09,250
I got 30.

1711
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:11,490
We're running out of patties again.

1712
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:12,950
So someone needs to shoot the rat.

1713
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,030
I'm making sodas.

1714
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:17,890
Check the vents.

1715
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:21,650
Oh, ha ha.

1716
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:24,690
Oh, my gosh.

1717
01:30:24,890 --> 01:30:26,390
This guy's gooing all over the place.

1718
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:27,990
We should have left the goo man.

1719
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,190
Oh, gross.

1720
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:30,790
Sterminated all of them.

1721
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:32,050
Wait.

1722
01:30:32,290 --> 01:30:32,790
Oh, my God.

1723
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:33,610
He's gooing.

1724
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,270
Yeah, I'm going to give him day old soda.

1725
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:36,130
He's not going to tell.

1726
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:38,070
He doesn't know.

1727
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:39,170
He doesn't know what.

1728
01:30:39,610 --> 01:31:10,310

I already got the sodas.

1732
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:18,090
I made the sodas.

1733
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:19,850
Oh, you did?

1734

I made an extra soda.

1736
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:21,770
It's for 31.

1737
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:23,230
Yeah, that's for 31.

1738

Which one is done?

1791
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:50,370
36, 36, 36?

1792
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:51,410
Where are you?

1793
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:52,750
37?

1794
01:34:54,290 --> 01:34:54,750
Ah!

1795
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,320
Oh gosh.

1796
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,860
I just made that.

1797
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,520

1798
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:07,560

1799
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:08,900

1800
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:15,990
the charge!

1801
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:19,910
36!

1802
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:22,490
I can't run any faster!

1803
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:27,090
Wait, where is he?

1804
01:35:27,490 --> 01:35:28,190
Did I miss it?

1805
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:32,330
Wait, where's 36?

1806
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:33,450
Am I blind?

1807
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:41,130
Was the 36 the guy that...

1808
01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:44,030
I think 36 was the guy that knocked over my tray.

1809
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:44,690
There's a rat!

1810
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:46,630
Yeah, 36 freaked out and left.

1811
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:50,810
Oh my god, that's double my people that have freaked out.

1812
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:52,690
The rats are back.

1813
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:55,690
We've covered rent, everybody!

1814
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:56,890
We don't even have to worry.

1815
01:35:59,110 --> 01:35:59,470
Oh!

1816
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:00,150
Who is that?

1817
01:36:00,150 --> 01:36:02,010
I went blue and walking around really slow.

1818
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:03,430
That's me!

1819
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:04,570
And I'm hurt!

1820
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:05,530
That's why!

1821
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:08,930
I'm old!

1822
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:12,590
I almost died.

1823
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:14,390
I almost died for real.

1824
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:16,150
Sheesh.

1825
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:19,410
That's suspicious.

1826
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:24,130
Oh my gosh, wait, can I watch them?

1827
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,610
Is this alive?

1828
01:36:27,630 --> 01:36:29,230
Oh no, it's not live.

1829
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:32,710
Ow!

1830
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:34,970
Oh my god.

1831
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:37,750
Uh oh.

1832
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,590
We got last.

1833
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,640
Why me again?

1834
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,040
That was 39.

1835
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,220
I couldn't read it.

1836
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,700
Oh my god.

1837
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:50,860
He got me twice.

1838
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,640
Okay, back into the healing tube.

1839
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:54,680
Why did he?

1840
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:57,000
He bee-lined towards me.

1841
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,260
I'm so obsessed.

1842
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,040
Oh god.

1843
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:09,000
Oh god.

1844
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:09,960
We're fine.

1845
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,400
Rent is fine.

1846
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,050
What was that?

1847
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,940
Get out of here.

1848
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:29,800
Get out of here.

1849
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:31,360
Oh.

1850
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,760
Why do we have a dead guy here?

1851
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:35,260
What?

1852
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,860
There's a dead customer here for some reason.

1853
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:39,760
Wait, how did he die?

1854
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,580
I don't know.

1855
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,880
Into the grinder.

1856
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:48,330
Into the grinder.

Oh wait!

1860
01:38:28,210 --> 01:38:30,290
We suffered from success that long.

1861
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:33,330
I'm going to grind here so I can respawn for the next day.

1862
01:38:33,590 --> 01:38:35,430
Because I'm once the bad crippling.

1863
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:37,690
Just heal yourself!

1864
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:39,170
What is she doing?

1865
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:42,650
Telling us all to die so that she can heal herself?

1866
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:45,390
What?

1867
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:49,030
Yeah, we killed Jason Voorhees.

1868
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:51,270
Oh, it took ten dollars!

1869
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:52,450
It took ten dollars!

1870
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:54,250
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1871
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:55,110
That was already done.

1872
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:12,440
Wait, but you guys could have used my body for more patties, so we didn't have to pay for patties.

1873
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:13,800
No, the people don't make patties.

1874
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,300
Yeah, we are robots.

1875
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:16,820
Aww.

1876
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:17,960
Yeah.

1877
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:19,320
Are we doing lettuce wraps?

1878
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:20,020
Oh, we got buns.

1879
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:21,660
Wait, what?

1880
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,140
Yeah, we got buns.

1881
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,600
We got buns, huh?

1882
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:27,120
We don't have to do gluten-free lettuce wrap burgers.

1883
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,380
Are you okay?

1884
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:34,650
Gluten-free in space.

1885
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:36,990
I'm sorry to tell you that.

1886
01:39:38,650 --> 01:39:41,270
I'm trying to paint like the most pristine pictures.

1887
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,190
It's all gluing and it's green.

1888
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:44,910
What's our logo now?

1889
01:39:44,990 --> 01:39:45,810
Is it still the same?

1890
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:48,770
I think it's the same because we started on the same day.

1891
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:49,870
Becca sloppy.

1892
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:51,570
This looks good.

1893
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:52,690
Oh, come to sloppy.

1894
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:56,070
Are you ready to start the next date?

1895
01:39:56,290 --> 01:39:57,030
Yeah, I think so.

1896
01:39:57,290 --> 01:39:57,750
Are you ready?

1897
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:01,110
Alright, get to it.

1898
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:01,890
Where's Lymu?

1899
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:04,510
I was grabbing ingredients.

1900
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:05,270
Oh, okay.

1901
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:07,330
I flipped the boat.

1902
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:08,330
Oh, we have refilled the tomato.

1903
01:40:08,650 --> 01:40:09,730
And the patties.

1904
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:13,510

01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,670

Oh, that one.

1915
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:37,790
Oh, that one.

1916
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:38,050

know.

1920
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,480
Um, we're fine.

1921
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,420
Everything's okay.

1922
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,480
What was that?

1923
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,360
You're still taking orders?

1924
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:47,760
Don't you want to make money so we can free Lymu back.

1925
01:41:49,230 --> 01:41:50,400
Only Lymu though.

1926
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:51,040
Only Lymu.

1927
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,800
Oh, I can't see.

1928
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:54,720
Wait.

1929
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:00,090
They've had me.

1930
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,710
I can um give prize out of the frame.

1931
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:10,140
Like everything will be fine.

1932
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:11,420
Everything will be fine.

1933
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,420
Okay, that's all.

1934
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,280
I can read to you.

1935
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:16,440
What do you need for now?

1936
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,300
Wait, where's the trick?

1937
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:18,740
The gun.

1938
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:19,980
She's still alive.

1939
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:21,640
The music is still so scary.

1940
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:22,620
I can't read.

1941
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:26,620
What?

1942
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,340
What is Doki yelling about?

1943
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:29,660
I can't understand her.

1944
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:30,640
I can't hear.

1945
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:31,340
I don't know.

1946
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:32,400
The first one.

1947
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,200
This is 49.

1948
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:35,540
Where's 49?

1949
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,380
Wait, where's 49?

1950
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,560
Mimi's like Blair Witching.

1951
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:42,140
What's going on?

1952
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:43,300
I don't know.

1953
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:44,060
I don't know.

1954
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,540
She's just emoting.

1955
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:48,720
I think the game is bugged for her.

1956
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:50,120
Oh.

1957
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,400
Wait, I can't hear Lymu.

1958
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:53,540
Oh.

1959
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:56,860
Uh, Doki just died?

1960
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:57,500
Oh.

1961
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:58,840
Hi, Mid.

1962
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:00,720
I didn't realize that you were in death's chat.

1963
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,320
It's just Mimi and she can't move.

1964
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,420
Oh yeah!

1965
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,080
I'm free, I'm free from being stuck at least.

1966
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:16,790
That was going so good.

1967
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:17,810
We were doing so...

1968
01:43:17,810 --> 01:43:18,570
We did a good job.

1969
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:20,690
You want to run it back one more time?

1970
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:23,470
Yeah, we can try one more time.

1971
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:24,490
Yeah, we can try one more time.

1972
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:24,510
Yeah, yeah.

1973
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:25,970
Wait, how did you two die?

1974
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:30,310
I got killed by the fucker that's sprinting around in the doorway just there.

1975
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:34,170
Yeah, I know how you died last, but what about men and stuffy?

1976
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:36,550
I tried shooting him, but he just killed me anyway.

1977
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:37,610
I think.

1978
01:43:37,610 --> 01:43:38,670
Yeah, he just killed me.

1979
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:41,190
Watch Snuffy try to shoot him and maybe miss.

1980
01:43:41,450 --> 01:43:43,270
And then he killed us both.

1981
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:44,650
Oh, I see, I see.

1982
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:46,150
Alright, restarting the lobby.

1983
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:49,330
That thing's freaky.

1984
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:53,810
I like the music that starts playing.

1985
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:57,030
When all hell breaks loose, it's like...

1986
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:07,960
We failed that shift because Snuffy failed us, everybody.

1987
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:10,160
That's just the hard fact.

1988
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:14,780
that's why we failed

1989
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,960
you can never tell with this game

1990
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:49,840
okay guys i have a bat just in case you have a bat oh b okay you can trip over on the bat just as i What should I make?

1991
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:52,580
Oh wow.

1992
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:54,140
That is worse.

1993
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,520
That's not very convenient.

1994
01:44:57,740 --> 01:44:57,960
All right.

1995
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:58,680
That's good.

1996
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:00,500
Just in case.

1997
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,620
Are we all ready to start our day?

1998
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:04,120
Yep.

1999
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:05,240
All right.

2000
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:09,740
Because I don't think we need Mint anyway, because she's doing our social media right now.

2001
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:12,120
Birthday's calm anyway.

2002
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,620
She's like the Wendy's of our restaurant.

2003
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,900
I'm gonna do one, two burgers, one pickle.

2004
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:23,010
Oh no!

2005
01:45:23,970 --> 01:45:26,710
Victor to put a smiley face.

2006
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:29,950
Catch a smiley face when it's done.

2007
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:33,410
I wish I could make it... Oh, I can make it smaller.

2008
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:36,390
Wait, I'm redo, redo.

2009
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:38,490
Oh, there we go.

2010
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:39,090
Okay, nice.

2011
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:46,140
All right, order one, order one, order one.

2012
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:48,600
Patty is getting ready.

2013
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:48,980
No.

2014
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,200
We'll make it...

2015
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:58,280
Blonde.

2016
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:02,420
This is my girlfriend.

2017
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,480
Like fries.

2018
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,400
Like fries.

2019
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:16,400
Actually, I don't want it blind.

2020
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:29,270
Let's stick to a simple palette.

2021
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:38,530
Because our place of establishment is for the refined palette.

2022
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:44,210
We don't need all of the fancies.

2023
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:48,290
I think you know what to do.

2024
01:46:52,350 --> 01:46:54,550
These guys are actually terrifying, honestly.

2025
01:46:55,850 --> 01:47:00,370
All right, uh, okay, I'm making an order number five and not someone else does.

2026
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:02,550
I don't think anyone's making five.

2027
01:47:02,690 --> 01:47:05,430
I see me making soda.

2028
01:47:06,230 --> 01:47:07,230
I'm making soda.

2029
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:10,490
Sloppy.

2030
01:47:12,670 --> 01:47:14,150
What does apply to face mean?

2031
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:17,770
I'm gonna get more patties.

2032
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:20,150
I'm gonna do a rough, uh, do a hard job.

2033
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,400
How do I get out of here?

2034
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:25,220
Uh,

2035
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,720
that's what it means on the face.

2036
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:40,780
I'm our own mascot.

2037
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,740
What's going on over here?

2038
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,200
Wait, let me see.

2039
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:46,640
Oh!

2040
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,440
I tripped all the fucking train and oh my god.

2041
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:48,700
Good.

2042
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,460
Thank you.

2043
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:51,640
Looks friendly.

2044
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:52,800
It's fucked, it's fucked.

2045
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,040
Somebody glooped, somebody glooped all over, watch out, spill, spill zone.

2046
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:57,000
Thank you.

2047
01:47:57,580 --> 01:47:58,540
What are we working on?

2048
01:47:58,620 --> 01:47:59,820
I'm making number seven.

2049
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:01,600
Okay, I'll make five.

2050
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:03,440
Oh, these three birds and fries.

2051
01:48:03,740 --> 01:48:05,620
No, I'm doing five, I'm doing five, I have to remake it.

2052
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,020
Okay, I'm doing eight.

2053
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:10,140
Thank you.

2054
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:17,060
So bad news, I shot a rat and the rat's body went flying, so like I couldn't get it.

2055
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:19,980
What orders are being worked on?

2056
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,360
What should I start on?

2057
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:21,700
I'm working.

2058
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:22,280
What do we got?

2059
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:23,440
Five, seven.

2060
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:27,140
Maybe we might need more prizes.

2061
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:27,720
I'm doing five.

2062
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:28,540
Anybody doing five?

2063
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,680
There is no five.

2064
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:30,520
I'm doing eight.

2065
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,120
That's fine.

2066
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,400
We're doing so good.

2067
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:33,640
I'm going to order nine five.

2068
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,460
There is no five.

2069
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:38,420
Anybody got order nine?

2070
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:42,080
I'm going to do it.

2071
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:42,560
No, no, no.

2072
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:43,200
Order nine.

2073
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,280
Okay, snap me on nine.

2074
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:44,820
I'll do ten.

2075
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:46,140
All right.

2076
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,200
I'm getting us more packed.

2077
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:49,800
We're cooking today.

2078
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:52,100
How's it still raw?

2079
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:53,920
Our hands touched on the patties.

2080
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:55,040
Oh my god.

2081
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:58,640
Both reached for a title at the same time.

2082
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:01,540
Both reached for the patty.

2083
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,480
I need an orange soda pop.

2084
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:05,440
Oh, is that?

2085
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:05,780
Oh.

2086
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:09,540
I gave it the soda, but it's already got a drink.

2087
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,420
It's glued down now.

2088
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:12,540
Off to eight.

2089
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:15,320
Number eight.

2090
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:16,400
Number eight.

2091
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:17,300
Raise your hand.

2092
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:18,100
Number eight.

2093
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:20,180
Woohoo!

2094
01:49:20,540 --> 01:49:21,760
You're welcome.

2095
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:24,620
Number five.

2096
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:28,220
I don't know where am I in my life.

2097
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:30,120
A little bit of...

2098
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,740
And I'm on the side.

2099
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,020

2101
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,140
Oh, this is like a patty that's raw forever.

2102
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:43,260
A patty that's raw.

2103
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:46,100
Wait, wait, what's happened to the computer monitor?

2104
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:47,320
What?

2105
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:48,920
Wait, no readers.

2106
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:49,780
No wonder.

2107
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:50,460
I think we're done.

2108
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,660
That's it?

2109
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:52,840
We're done?

2110
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:54,680
We made our rent already, by the way.

2111
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:55,760
I'm just gonna pay it.

2112
01:49:55,780 --> 01:50:05,390
And then we'll find money and then like pay like stockpile it for the next couple days.

2113
01:50:06,570 --> 01:50:09,130
Well that is if anybody else comes home.

2114
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:10,510

Me too.

2123
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:25,950
What's wrong with me?

2124
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:27,450
I think she should get her some help.

2125
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:31,030
I think she might have a rough home life.

2126
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,190

2127
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:32,870

I'm the company mascot.

2134
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:47,110

Is it just a blank?

2163
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,460
It's just a void, right?

2164
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:24,120
Is it just a void?

2165
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:24,600

01:58:14,190 --> 01:58:15,550
That's your door bump.

2269
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:19,730
It took a bump out of you because you're so irresistible.

2270
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:21,230
I love that.

2271
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:21,910
That's very good.

2272
01:58:22,110 --> 01:58:22,650
I changed.

2273
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:23,610
Oh, it's your eye patch.

2274
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:24,870
That's my eye patch.

2275
01:58:25,490 --> 01:58:26,810
Hey, don't make...

2276
01:58:26,810 --> 01:58:27,170
You got it.

2277
01:58:27,170 --> 01:58:27,970
Get it right, mom.

2278
01:58:28,150 --> 01:58:28,630
Get it right.

2279
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:29,630
It's my eye patch.

2280
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:35,010
It looks so stupid.

2281
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:38,130
Wait, you can't tell it's an eye patch at all.

2282
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:39,510
It really looks like...

2283
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:42,090
Someone took a chop out of my face.

2284
01:58:49,150 --> 01:58:49,730
Where's the...

2285
01:58:49,730 --> 01:58:50,370
Oh, hello.

2286
01:58:50,690 --> 01:58:52,110
Welcome to Sloppy's.

2287
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:03,090
I like your business.

2288
01:59:03,190 --> 01:59:04,130
I like your table touching.

2289
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:04,730
You're doing good.

2290
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:05,290
You're doing good.

2291
01:59:05,470 --> 01:59:06,650
Oh, there's someone coming in.

2292
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:07,530
There's someone coming in.

2293
01:59:07,610 --> 01:59:08,970
Why are they so, like, wiggly?

2294
01:59:09,590 --> 01:59:10,770
There's someone coming in.

2295
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:11,330
Look normal.

2296
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,550
Look normal.

2297
01:59:13,490 --> 01:59:13,930
We're fine.

2298
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:14,390
Everything's fine.

2299
01:59:14,670 --> 01:59:16,750
She may have put too many patties on the grill.

2300
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:17,830
Order Order 22.

2301
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:19,350
I was doing 22.

2302
01:59:19,550 --> 01:59:20,350
I got 22.

2303
01:59:20,610 --> 01:59:21,690
That's a lot of burgers.

2304
01:59:22,110 --> 01:59:22,510
22.

2305
01:59:23,290 --> 01:59:24,530
I don't know about you.

2306
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:25,630
Oh my gosh.

2307
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:25,650
Oh my gosh.

2308
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:26,850
Prize for 22 coming up.

2309
01:59:26,890 --> 01:59:27,450
Gonna make a home.

2310
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:28,450
Oh no drinks.

2311
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:28,770
No drinks.

2312
01:59:28,770 --> 01:59:30,850
Is anyone listening to the new Taylor Swift songs?

2313
01:59:31,770 --> 01:59:31,970
No.

2314
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:34,610
I heard it's bad because she's happy.

2315
01:59:35,430 --> 01:59:36,410
Because she's happy?

2316
01:59:36,410 --> 01:59:37,290
Is that what you said?

2317
01:59:37,490 --> 01:59:39,870
Yeah, because like, yeah, because before his date.

2318
01:59:40,110 --> 01:59:40,970
Oh, it's because she's happy.

2319
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:44,110
Now it's happening, like, happily, to be happily married.

2320
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:44,690
So we saw her.

2321
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:45,630
I'm doing Order 13.

2322
01:59:45,630 --> 01:59:48,910
Did someone make me the drink from 13?

2323
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:50,770
I got you.

2324
01:59:51,030 --> 01:59:51,590
Thank you.

2325
01:59:52,630 --> 01:59:52,950
Good.

2326
01:59:53,790 --> 01:59:54,770
Thanks, pal.

2327
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:56,550
You're so welcome.

2328
02:00:00,150 --> 02:00:01,770
Give a little extra fan service.

2329
02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:04,370
Thank you very much.

2330
02:00:07,370 --> 02:00:08,550
This job is easy.

2331
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:09,950
Oh, we got more customers.

2332
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:14,770
Oh, I'm not looking at you anyway.

2333
02:00:14,930 --> 02:00:15,370
Wait, wait.

2334
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:17,030
I will see you on a bomb!

2335
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:18,930
Oh.

2336
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:20,410
Oh my god.

2337
02:00:21,450 --> 02:00:23,290
It's not even that scary.

2338
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:23,870
Oh!

2339
02:00:25,230 --> 02:00:25,670
Ah!

2340
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:27,830
How did I die?

2341
02:00:28,510 --> 02:00:30,330
This is my redemption arc, you guys!

2342
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:32,970
I was just standing here!

2343
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:35,590
Where'd you go?

2344
02:00:38,010 --> 02:00:39,030
Hold up, hold up.

2345
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:40,790
You got this, right?

2346
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:42,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold up.

2347
02:00:42,870 --> 02:00:43,470
We need black.

2348
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:45,470
Oh dear, we need black.

2349
02:00:45,630 --> 02:00:50,050
I think I clicked up and misclicked.

2350
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:50,630
I think he's mine too.

2351
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:51,190
Ow.

2352
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:53,290
We died, Nimi.

2353
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:54,750
Must have misclicked an ingredient.

2354
02:00:56,110 --> 02:00:57,230
Oh, he's...

2355
02:00:57,230 --> 02:00:58,830
I don't even know what happened.

2356
02:00:58,930 --> 02:00:59,770
He's probably lying.

2357
02:00:59,870 --> 02:01:01,930
Oh, he's like indestructible or something.

2358
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:03,870
It seems bad.

2359
02:01:04,350 --> 02:01:06,030
It seems pretty bad.

2360
02:01:07,490 --> 02:01:07,750
Wait.

2361
02:01:11,190 --> 02:01:11,590
What?

2362
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:12,890
What?

2363
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:14,590
I'm not alive.

2364
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:15,450
How the fuck did you give me?

2365
02:01:15,630 --> 02:01:18,270
How did he, I don't, he got me too, I don't know how.

2366
02:01:19,370 --> 02:01:23,310
Wait, he just, he just snagged me from across the fucking room.

2367
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:24,870
I just stubbed my toe every time.

2368
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:26,710
Oh, Demi, congratulations.

2369
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:27,850
Don't lie.

2370
02:01:29,030 --> 02:01:30,910
Oh, yeah, he's, uh, okay, me, okay.

2371
02:01:31,450 --> 02:01:32,310
Is he still out there?

2372
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:33,490
Yes, he's still out there.

2373
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:34,430
Oh, no.

2374
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:45,550
Oh, you were so close.

2375
02:01:45,630 --> 02:01:47,830
Uh-oh, wait, my game broke!

2376
02:01:48,430 --> 02:01:49,350
My game broke!

2377
02:01:49,590 --> 02:01:51,190
Oh, there's the first!

2378
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:53,390
Wait!

2379
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:54,790
Because Snuffy!

2380
02:01:55,470 --> 02:01:57,450
Snuffy broke the game!

2381
02:01:57,750 --> 02:01:59,490
I thought, like, yeah, I saw him.

2382
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:01,130
Have you seen me?

2383
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:03,070
Do you want me to reset it?

2384
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:07,450
No, this is kind of...

2385
02:02:07,450 --> 02:02:09,510
I don't know if he...

2386
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:12,030
Wait, oh, he...

2387
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:14,370
I'm... I'm alive!

2388
02:02:16,490 --> 02:02:17,710
We got a tufer!

2389
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:20,670
Okay, let's get a lot.

2390
02:02:21,090 --> 02:02:21,150
Oh.

2391
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:23,450
My bad.

2392
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:24,550
Did he leave?

2393
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:26,210
I think he might still be sneaking around.

2394
02:02:26,290 --> 02:02:27,330
Yeah, he's still out there.

2395
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:28,250
He's still out there.

2396
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:30,390
I don't think we can kill him.

2397
02:02:31,090 --> 02:02:32,830
Hey, is that why you never shot him?

2398
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:33,110
Wait.

2399
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,120
What the heck is that?

2400
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:39,060
Wait, there's like also a...

2401
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:39,800
He's gone.

2402
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:40,720
He's actually dead.

2403
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:41,680
He's gone?

2404
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:41,900
He's dead.

2405
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,180
Oh, dang it.

2406
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:43,960
I did it again.

2407
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:45,620
Hold on, I got you.

2408
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:46,520
I got you.

2409
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:51,260
Wait, you guys, I saw like a TV monitor or something going off.

2410
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:55,600
We probably lost a lot of customers.

2411
02:02:59,190 --> 02:02:59,850
Lime moon.

2412
02:03:00,210 --> 02:03:00,830
Oh, dang it!

2413
02:03:00,970 --> 02:03:02,770
I don't know why he wiped this out.

2414
02:03:03,950 --> 02:03:04,730
Oh, wait, what?

2415
02:03:04,890 --> 02:03:05,430
There's another one.

2416
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:06,270
Where's the mob?

2417
02:03:10,410 --> 02:03:10,930
Charge.

2418
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:12,170
Charge.

2419
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:20,240
I'm healing?

2420
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:49,200

You're supposed to be in here.

2422
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:02,080
What is happening?

2423
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,160
You just sit here for 10 seconds.

2424
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,600
She's got to plop it up.

2425
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:09,280
Wait, what does that?

2426
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:10,980
Go feed my dog.

2427
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:12,800
There's a mimic.

2428
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:13,680
There's a mimic.

2429
02:04:27,670 --> 02:04:28,970
Sorry, that was my dog.

2430
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:33,430
Oh my god.

2431
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:35,590
Wait, how did you die, Snuffy?

2432
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:38,110
There was an imposter.

2433
02:04:39,110 --> 02:04:40,670
Oh, so it was the mimic that got you.

2434
02:04:41,150 --> 02:04:43,370
He's, like, still walking around in the background.

2435
02:04:43,670 --> 02:04:45,790
We still want to still be able to move around.

2436
02:04:46,570 --> 02:04:48,270
Did we all die to the imposter?

2437
02:04:49,310 --> 02:04:49,670
Yes.

2438
02:04:50,350 --> 02:04:52,590
There was a fucking sniper at the bed.

2439
02:04:53,230 --> 02:04:54,590
Yeah, there was a bed guy.

2440
02:04:54,730 --> 02:04:55,410
There was a bed guy.

2441
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:56,110
They were so sloppy.

2442
02:04:56,410 --> 02:05:00,270
They were like flooring the dog in the van and he shot me down

2443
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:05,900
Maybe we should have just paid our rent

2444
02:05:09,980 --> 02:05:21,820
I I think we learned our lesson I think we can do I think we can okay we can make it we can make it Okay, we can make it Okay,

2445
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:30,820
we got this we got this i believe It's so...

2446
02:05:31,540 --> 02:05:33,480
This is so crazy.

2447
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:36,600
I think I got by a thing in the vent.

2448
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:39,720
But there was like one point I saw...

2449
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:43,820
It was like a TV monitor came from the ceiling.

2450
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:44,780
It was crazy.

2451
02:05:46,580 --> 02:05:48,080
The glitch out was so good.

2452
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:51,120
Bloody Mary.

2453
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:53,680
What was that?

2454
02:05:55,100 --> 02:05:58,520
Yeah, Doki, what happened to me is that I...

2455
02:05:58,540 --> 02:05:59,600
I heard you scream.

2456
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:01,820
I turned around and said, is that a scream important?

2457
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:06,100
And then a red light scanned across the room and shot me down.

2458
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:07,040
Oh, no.

2459
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:11,520
I saw, like, a TV monitor come up from, like, the ceiling.

2460
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:12,500
I think it was that.

2461
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:13,360
Yeah.

2462
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,100
Yeah, I think it was, like, an automated gun or something.

2463
02:06:16,460 --> 02:06:16,860
Something, yeah.

2464
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:18,080
God, I don't know what reason.

2465
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:22,240
There's, like, snipers there in the fucking bed?

2466
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,220
But I'm sick, too.

2467
02:06:25,060 --> 02:06:25,720
All right.

2468
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:27,640
Oh.

2469
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:29,240
the logo.

2470
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:31,740
Yes, I wanted to find the logo.

2471
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:34,220
All right, I'm starting us up.

2472
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:35,780
Okay.

2473
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:40,440
What about what?

2474
02:06:41,180 --> 02:06:44,060
We got two orders.

2475
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:48,820
I'm gonna make the thing for order two as well.

2476
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:49,740
Okay.

2477
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:52,700
I'm doing the one thing I'm good at.

2478
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:54,960
I'm starting.

2479
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:56,780
Oh, oh, there's buns on everywhere.

2480
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:57,600
There's buns everywhere.

2481
02:06:57,940 --> 02:06:57,940
Wait.

2482
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:01,640
do order one.

2483
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:02,200
Order one.

2484
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:02,620
All right.

2485
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:03,560
Okay, okay, okay.

2486
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:05,320
I can do either.

2487
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:06,320
They're both three bergs.

2488
02:07:06,700 --> 02:07:07,580
Yeah, three bergs.

2489
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:11,420
Paddies are coming in hot.

2490
02:07:11,740 --> 02:07:12,440
Coming in hot.

2491
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:13,540
Burning my fingers.

2492
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:15,740
Grabbing it with your fingers.

2493
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:17,700
I put my face on.

2494
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:18,300
Three.

2495
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:19,260
Order two coming out.

2496
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:20,460
All right, I'm grabbing.

2497
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:21,360
Order three?

2498
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:23,320
All right.

2499
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:25,120
I'm doing order three.

2500
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:25,620

02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:35,940
A guy tried to catch me in his aura, but I was too far.

2505
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:37,040
His aura.

2506
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:38,360
Order six.

2507
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:39,740
I doubt it.

2508
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,860
That would be just what it is.

2509
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:44,500
Order five, come on out!

2510
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:45,900
Don't waste money.

2511
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:48,940
Six.

2512
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:50,400
With your aura.

2513
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:53,080
Emo guy over here.

2514
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,360
Play, play, play, play, play, play.

2515
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:58,380
I robbed somebody.

2516
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:01,280
I'm going to read a graphic.

2517
02:09:01,380 --> 02:09:04,520
I'm eating candy on the job!

2518
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:06,200
Oh!

2519
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:09,400
Oh, what happened?

2520
02:09:10,380 --> 02:09:10,560
Oh!

2521
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:14,460
Oh!

2522
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:16,460
Oh god!

2523
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:17,920
Oh!

2524
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:19,340
My sensitivity!

2525
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:20,000
Are you good?

2526
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:20,820
The candy!

2527
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,040
Don't eat the candy!

2528
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:23,280
Don't eat the candy!

2529
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:30,020
She's having a trip right now!

2530
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:30,840
She's having a trip!

2531
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:35,780
I'll be fine.

2532
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:40,800
I could move at exciting speeds.

2533
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:42,160
Ready for order eight?

2534
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:43,340
There you go.

2535
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:44,640
I'm waiting for you.

2536
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:50,480
I'm doing order nine.

2537
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:51,300
Okay.

2538
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:53,720
Can someone make me the drink for nine?

2539
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:54,700
I'll make you the drink.

2540
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:56,740
Thank you.

2541
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,140
You are the drink.

2542
02:10:02,860 --> 02:10:03,920
I was just making sure.

2543
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:08,060
It's a big discovery.

2544
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:09,620
Thank you.

2545
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:10,200
Uh-huh.

2546
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:14,420
That's nine, right?

2547
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:16,400
There's another.

2548
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:17,180
You're so efficient.

2549
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:18,200
We got another customer.

2550
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:19,020
I got him.

2551
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:22,320
I'll start it on a drink for him.

2552
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:26,320
I'll put more candy for the running out again.

2553
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:31,080
I have to try and get that guy trained without accidentally looking at him.

2554
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:32,240
That's fucked up.

2555
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:33,780
Uh-oh.

2556
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:34,640
Someone doing ten?

2557
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:35,740
I'm working on him.

2558
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:38,120
Okay, I'll get you fries.

2559
02:10:38,440 --> 02:10:38,640
Thank you.

2560
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:39,700
One patty, too late.

2561
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:43,940
We need someone to kill some rats downstairs because we're like running out of patty.

2562
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:46,920
No, you don't need so many freaking patty's, dokey.

2563
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:48,040
What are you doing?

2564
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:51,400
I'm out of the kitchen and there's 15 people.

2565
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:56,260
Yeah, but we're sitting here for a day too.

2566
02:10:56,980 --> 02:10:58,520
What the rats will come?

2567
02:10:59,140 --> 02:11:00,400
The girls are fighting.

2568
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:02,580
The girls are fighting.

2569
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:05,760
Oh, this is what Sloppy's has come to.

2570
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:10,740
Oh,

2571
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:21,560
slobby, we're just, we're slapping, oh, I think it's 100% last time, we're the fuck are our customers.

2572
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:24,960
I pissed somebody off, though.

2573
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:27,140
Yeah, one guy got his order wrong.

2574
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:29,660
Oh, how did you make it mad?

2575
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:30,600
What did you do?

2576
02:11:30,780 --> 02:11:31,800
That's not what I ordered.

2577
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:32,780
Play blah, play blah.

2578
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:34,660
Wait, what's that?

2579
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:35,760
Oh, it can't.

2580
02:11:35,780 --> 02:11:36,320
candle.

2581
02:11:37,980 --> 02:11:40,400
This clort picture is like really freaking.

2582
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:42,580
Okay, I'm missing a Nimi.

2583
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:47,500
I guess we have time to redesign our bakery while we wait for customers.

2584
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:48,980
Oh yeah, we need a logo.

2585
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:50,140
Oh yeah.

2586
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:52,440
There's so many patties.

2587
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:54,940
There's so many patties.

2588
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:59,400
What if we just ended the day and then did it again?

2589
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:01,380
Are they going to be fresh for tomorrow?

2590
02:12:02,060 --> 02:12:03,280
Yeah, it'll be fresh for tomorrow.

2591
02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:05,000
It's made up out of rats.

2592
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:08,700
It's made out of rats, so it's fine.

2593
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:10,860
So it's fine, yeah.

2594
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:14,720
They have like, 22 hour expiry date.

2595
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:16,200
Fucking Christ, Doki.

2596
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:17,740
It's weird way.

2597
02:12:18,260 --> 02:12:20,160
You made, like, the whole supply.

2598
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:21,360
Oh, yeah.

2599
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:23,720
Guys are running home on burgers.

2600
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:29,680
Yeah, Doki was yelling at everyone being like, go shoot more rats!

2601
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:34,760
And here are the bugs.

2602
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:36,540
You need a bug catcher.

2603
02:12:37,620 --> 02:12:38,980
Oh, that's our logo.

2604
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:40,720
Oh, wait.

2605
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:42,820
You guys want to make the logo?

2606
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:44,900
I think it should be a little rat.

2607
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:47,540
Oh, that's true.

2608
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:53,120
Do you guys remember how long like food can be at like, or meat can be at room temperature before it becomes a biohazard?

2609
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:53,860
Just wondering.

2610
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:55,900
In the game or in real life?

2611
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:02,680
It has rat preservatives on it.

2612
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:03,300
We're fine.

2613
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:06,280
But it also attracts the actual rats.

2614
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:11,840
That's why the rats want the patty's back, trying to bury the dead.

2615
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:13,600
Oh, that's sad.

2616
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:22,860
No, you know, if they did like those video science videos where like, um, they test out how fast, fast food rot.

2617
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:24,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2618
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:25,780
It's like, yeah, yeah.

2619
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:27,980
In space, it never rots.

2620
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:30,140
I'm ready for the next day if you guys are.

2621
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:31,060
I'm ready.

2622
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:32,500
I've restocked the fridge.

2623
02:13:32,920 --> 02:13:33,380
That's why.

2624
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:34,700
It's totally for signing your logo.

Yeah.

2922
02:27:44,300 --> 02:27:45,360
Something has spawned.

2923
02:27:45,480 --> 02:27:47,220
I think because my green just buzzed again.

2924
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:49,840
So we ran out of patties.

2925
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:50,400

2926
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:53,680
We didn't run out of patties.

2927
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:54,840
What are you talking about?

2928
02:27:55,940 --> 02:27:57,800

I don't know what to do.

2943
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:36,400
Put a lid on it.

No binds left!

2981
02:30:26,950 --> 02:30:27,710
Uh-oh.

2982
02:30:28,250 --> 02:30:29,390
Watch out!

2983
02:30:30,050 --> 02:30:31,070
Watch out!

2984
02:30:31,390 --> 02:30:31,790
Watch out!

2985
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:34,940
The TV!

2986
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:36,700
We're supposed to work in these conditions!

2987
02:30:40,830 --> 02:30:43,010
Oh my god, the TV is looking at us everywhere.

2988
02:30:43,230 --> 02:30:45,110
I think we need to shoot the TV, you guys!

2989
02:30:48,570 --> 02:30:50,450
He's yelling at me and I died!

2990
02:30:51,950 --> 02:30:52,730
Wait, what?

2991
02:30:53,270 --> 02:30:53,930
What is that?

2992
02:30:54,870 --> 02:30:55,950
Wait, our customer's shot?

2993
02:30:56,190 --> 02:30:57,110
What did she do?

2994
02:30:57,510 --> 02:30:59,190
No, no, the TV keeps shooting people.

2995
02:30:59,350 --> 02:31:01,310
If you can make the orders, I'll keep an eye out for the TV.

2996
02:31:01,470 --> 02:31:02,710
The TV killed me.

2997
02:31:02,770 --> 02:31:04,910
Oh, I think I'm back.

2998
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:09,990
I'm gonna get them.

2999
02:31:09,990 --> 02:31:10,410
I'm gonna get them.

3000
02:31:10,410 --> 02:31:10,890
They're in a box.

3001
02:31:12,530 --> 02:31:12,710
Okay.

3002
02:31:12,830 --> 02:31:13,750
We have no buns left.

3003
02:31:13,870 --> 02:31:14,650
I can't do anything.

3004
02:31:14,850 --> 02:31:15,710
Yeah, we have no buns.

3005
02:31:16,770 --> 02:31:17,510
They're coming up.

3006
02:31:17,530 --> 02:31:17,910
They're coming up.

3007
02:31:17,950 --> 02:31:18,550
Somebody's getting them.

3008
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:18,830
Okay.

3009
02:31:19,310 --> 02:31:19,670
Okay.

3010
02:31:21,190 --> 02:31:22,590
What's going on in here?

3011
02:31:23,110 --> 02:31:23,470
Okay.

3012
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:31,860
I think it's...

3013
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:32,960
I think it's...

3014
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:33,500
Buns go here.

3015
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:35,000
Buns on the left.

3016
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:35,840
Buns on the left.

3017
02:31:36,280 --> 02:31:36,980
One on each.

3018
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:37,520
One on each.

3019
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:39,880
Oh no, no, you did the wrong one.

3020
02:31:41,860 --> 02:31:43,120
I ordered two sets.

3021
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:43,840
It should be okay.

3022
02:31:44,200 --> 02:31:44,540
Okay.

3023
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:47,040
Well, goodbye number 38.

3024
02:31:47,740 --> 02:31:47,960
Maybe.

3025
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:50,520

02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:52,220

No, I think it moved.

3036
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:35,720
We have no more lids.

3037
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:37,520
Order some lids.

3038
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:39,820
I'll order lids.

3039
02:32:41,380 --> 02:32:42,120
This game is hard.

3040
02:32:42,380 --> 02:32:43,560
Oh, wait, it's in here!

3041
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:45,020
Where's the gun?

02:32:55,330 --> 02:32:55,970
I think it left.

3044
02:32:59,650 --> 02:33:00,930
I'm ordering lids.

3045
02:33:01,770 --> 02:33:02,730
Wait, the computer's occupied.

3046
02:33:02,750 --> 02:33:13,230

02:33:50,350 --> 02:33:52,770
Wait, it says I'm dead.

3050
02:33:53,950 --> 02:33:54,710
Are you dead?

3051
02:33:55,130 --> 02:33:56,070
Nokia, are you dead?

3052
02:33:56,690 --> 02:33:57,430
No, I'm alive.

3053
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:02,280
I'm not gonna save this because I'll get a chance.

3054
02:34:03,740 --> 02:34:04,480
What's happening?

3055
02:34:05,980 --> 02:34:07,260
Nimmy, can you see me?

3056
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:09,300
Yes.

3057
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:10,760
And you can hear me?

3058
02:34:11,860 --> 02:34:12,260
Yes.

3059
02:34:12,520 --> 02:34:14,360
I'm a ghost.

3060
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:16,260
It says you're dead on my screen though.

3061
02:34:16,480 --> 02:34:16,760
Yeah.

3062
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:17,140
Oh.

3063
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:18,980
Oh.

3064
02:34:36,840 --> 02:34:40,080
I wonder if I go in here if I'll revive.

3065
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:41,220
No.

3066
02:34:42,860 --> 02:34:44,880
It still says you're dead, though.

3067
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:47,600
It's so weird.

3068
02:34:47,860 --> 02:34:51,300
But it won't let me use the computer because I think it thinks I'm dead.

3069
02:34:52,980 --> 02:34:55,520
Yeah, we can't disappoint customers if we just close, right?

3070
02:34:55,660 --> 02:34:56,260
It doesn't count.

3071
02:34:57,460 --> 02:34:59,380
I don't know what we're supposed to do.

3072
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:00,600
I'm so confused.

3073
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:04,780
Oh, the day's over.

3074
02:35:08,180 --> 02:35:09,600
We disappointed everyone.

3075
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:14,200
Okay, we gotta restock.

3076
02:35:14,420 --> 02:35:15,800
We have to restock, guys.

3077
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:17,060
We are still running out of.

3078
02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:18,420
We're running out of.

3079
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:19,800
What do we need?

3080
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:22,800
Liz, Liz, Liz.

3081
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:23,860
We're running out of Liz.

3082
02:35:27,320 --> 02:35:28,760
That's the only thing we're running out of.

3083
02:35:29,960 --> 02:35:31,720
It wouldn't let me use the computer.

3084
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:34,460
That's weird.

3085
02:35:35,520 --> 02:35:36,420
Oh, now it'll let me.

3086
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:37,240
I can't use it.

3087
02:35:37,260 --> 02:35:38,840
Yeah, I can use it.

3088
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:41,960
Maybe I'm...

3089
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:42,300
Uh-oh.

3090
02:35:42,760 --> 02:35:43,140
Uh-oh.

3091
02:35:43,220 --> 02:35:44,980
The power's going to...

3092
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:48,780
I'm going?

3093
02:35:55,990 --> 02:35:56,910
Turn on the power?

3094
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:00,650
Wait, what?

3095
02:36:01,550 --> 02:36:02,010
Oh!

3096
02:36:03,910 --> 02:36:05,610
Oh, you have to do a thing!

3097
02:36:06,990 --> 02:36:08,170
Yeah, okay, well...

3098
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:08,690
Oh, okay.

3099
02:36:10,510 --> 02:36:10,970
Oop.

3100
02:36:17,700 --> 02:36:19,400
I didn't see the Simon says.

3101
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:25,560
Everything's fine, you guys.

3102
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:27,720
Everything's fine.

3103
02:36:31,220 --> 02:36:31,820
What's up?

3104
02:36:32,380 --> 02:36:32,940
What is this?

3105
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:34,400
This is a cup.

3106
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:36,420
I've got cups.

3107
02:36:38,980 --> 02:36:39,820
Restock cups.

3108
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:44,780
The soda machine is our downfall, I have to say.

3109
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:45,820
The day is over.

3110
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:48,520
Wait, oh, our cups are full, that's why.

3111
02:36:49,220 --> 02:36:50,220
Um, I'll put it here.

3112
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:52,360
Yeah, yeah.

3113
02:36:52,540 --> 02:36:53,300
Oh, I did it!

3114
02:36:53,820 --> 02:36:56,320
Wait, we didn't get- we didn't get lids!

3115
02:36:56,480 --> 02:36:57,160
We didn't get lids!

3116
02:37:03,550 --> 02:37:05,270
They might be downstairs still!

3117
02:37:08,090 --> 02:37:09,510
We got cups.

3118
02:37:12,110 --> 02:37:13,430
Everything is buns!

3119
02:37:14,950 --> 02:37:16,250
Everything is buns!

3120
02:37:21,420 --> 02:37:22,640
Yeah, are you real?

3121
02:37:22,860 --> 02:37:23,100
Are you real?

3122
02:37:23,180 --> 02:37:23,580
Are you real?

3123
02:37:24,060 --> 02:37:24,660
That's not real!

3124
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:25,280
That's not real!

3125
02:37:25,460 --> 02:37:26,000
That's not real!

3126
02:37:28,230 --> 02:37:28,850
That's a bad one!

3127
02:37:28,890 --> 02:37:30,350
Oh no shit, there's two of them!

3128
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:31,710
Doki, speak!

3129
02:37:31,990 --> 02:37:35,050
No, it's a 19, but I have to say no.

3130
02:37:37,930 --> 02:37:41,490
Oh my god, thank god you make the right choice.

3131
02:37:42,190 --> 02:37:42,590
Ah!

3132
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:47,320
Why won't it let me stalk anything?

3133
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:48,580
Am I crazy?

3134
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:50,800
This is cups.

3135
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:54,240
Oh, we do have lids, just kidding.

3136
02:37:54,420 --> 02:37:55,720
Why did it say no lids, though?

3137
02:37:57,820 --> 02:37:59,600
Can anybody read the television?

3138
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:00,660
Somebody's a fan?

3139
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:04,140
Yeah, no, I can read it.

3140
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:05,320
Wait, you can read it?

3141
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:08,160
All right, well, I guess only live will can make sure it is.

3142
02:38:08,540 --> 02:38:08,960
Yeah, I know.

3143
02:38:09,100 --> 02:38:09,960
I can't see them.

3144
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:10,880
I can't either.

3145
02:38:11,740 --> 02:38:12,420
Me too.

3146
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:14,780
I'm gonna put more pat on it.

3147
02:38:14,920 --> 02:38:16,100
Wait, why is it a white screen?

3148
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:18,160
You're on kitchen duty, live room.

3149
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:19,280

For some reason, you're so quiet for me.

3288
02:46:34,680 --> 02:46:36,900
Lymo, and you just keep getting quieter and quieter.

Go, go, go.

3301

We need more tomatoes.

3302
02:47:04,160 --> 02:47:05,900

It's messed up that there's a vent in the break room.

3310
02:47:22,700 --> 02:47:24,200
Our score's not going down.

3311
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:27,420
We're going up, up, up, up to the moon.

3312
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:30,000
Wait, but we have money all of a sudden.

How did we get 100% money?

3317
02:47:37,380 --> 02:47:38,140
I don't know.

3318
02:47:38,760 --> 02:47:43,240
How the fuck are we supposed to do this if I'm getting quieter and quieter and I'm the only one that can read the monster?

3319
02:47:43,500 --> 02:47:45,760
Sure, men just didn't take a funny little candy.

And then before you know it, you're spending your life savings on hubba-bubba.

3324
02:49:30,220 --> 02:49:34,380
And then you go from candy, and then not just candy, you'll go to pastries.

3325
02:49:34,900 --> 02:49:36,160
And that's when the real trouble.

02:49:37,240 --> 02:49:41,520
You ever go double, double with hubba-bubba and juicy fruit and mix it together?

3327

You're insane.

Let's do an 85.

3338
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,460
Input to a task.

3339
02:51:07,080 --> 02:51:07,260
Okay.

3340
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:08,740
This guy loves lettuce.

3341
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:14,080
I'm cleaning up like a good employee.

3342
02:51:15,220 --> 02:51:18,100
You guys, I think I'm going to be employee of the month, actually.

3343
02:51:29,900 --> 02:51:31,860
No effect.

3344
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:36,060
No effect.

3345
02:51:37,180 --> 02:51:37,820
Thank you.

3346
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:38,910
What was that?

3347
02:51:44,620 --> 02:51:45,540
Surprise!

3348
02:51:46,180 --> 02:51:47,000
Oh my god.

3349
02:51:56,980 --> 02:51:59,300
What is doggy yelling about?

3350
02:52:00,080 --> 02:52:00,380
Are you okay?

3351
02:52:00,720 --> 02:52:05,990
Just like the rat, like, join the patty.

3352
02:52:06,590 --> 02:52:07,290
Oh yeah, they do that.

3353
02:52:07,410 --> 02:52:07,950
That's what they do.

3354
02:52:09,190 --> 02:52:10,430
This is a soda for 87.

3355
02:52:11,170 --> 02:52:12,490
Okay, who's working on what?

3356
02:52:13,730 --> 02:52:14,810
I'm working on 89.

3357
02:52:16,010 --> 02:52:16,330
Okay.

3358
02:52:17,430 --> 02:52:19,770
I'll do 86, or who's doing 85?

3359
02:52:20,770 --> 02:52:20,930
Anybody?

3360
02:52:22,030 --> 02:52:22,250
No?

3361
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:23,190
Nope.

3362
02:52:23,570 --> 02:52:23,850
Okay.

3363
02:52:23,970 --> 02:52:24,130
Nope.

3364
02:52:24,310 --> 02:52:25,630
I'm just flipping patties.

3365
02:52:26,130 --> 02:52:26,570
89.

3366
02:52:27,630 --> 02:52:27,810
89.

3367
02:52:28,450 --> 02:52:28,510
89.

3368
02:52:28,510 --> 02:52:29,610
There's a growth soda on the side.

3369
02:52:30,110 --> 02:52:32,930
85, 3, and 2 pickles.

3370
02:52:36,470 --> 02:52:38,250
Wait, I need another one.

3371
02:52:42,250 --> 02:52:45,050
There's two boxes of bad exterminator.

3372
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:48,010
Alright.

3373
02:52:49,650 --> 02:52:50,210
85.

3374
02:52:53,870 --> 02:52:54,170
Oh!

3375
02:52:57,130 --> 02:52:58,250
Don't get mad at me.

3376
02:52:58,430 --> 02:52:59,030
Don't get mad at me.

3377
02:53:00,530 --> 02:53:01,630
Wait, who are you?

3378
02:53:05,550 --> 02:53:07,150
Wait, where'd 85 go?

3379
02:53:15,150 --> 02:53:16,470
Where'd 85 go?

3380
02:53:19,590 --> 02:53:21,330
Oh my god.

3381
02:53:21,590 --> 02:53:21,750
What?

3382
02:53:21,950 --> 02:53:22,610
Did he leave?

3383
02:53:22,930 --> 02:53:25,750
Oh, that's a big guy.

3384
02:53:29,410 --> 02:53:30,030
Thank you.

3385
02:53:37,780 --> 02:53:38,860
Wait, why can't I?

3386
02:53:39,380 --> 02:53:41,900
Two burgers, one, one, one, two on those, man.

3387
02:53:42,040 --> 02:53:42,420
Okay.

3388
02:53:43,700 --> 02:53:44,360
I got more.

3389
02:53:46,920 --> 02:53:48,920
Is anyone making 92?

3390
02:53:50,500 --> 02:53:53,220
It still says 85, though.

3391
02:53:53,640 --> 02:53:54,980
Yeah, but it's up for the rat.

3392
02:53:55,300 --> 02:53:57,680
85, wait, no, 87's being done here.

3393
02:53:58,340 --> 02:53:59,460
I'm making 92.

3394
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:02,200
I'm making patties.

3395
02:54:03,460 --> 02:54:04,580
I got two enough, right?

3396
02:54:04,820 --> 02:54:07,020
Hey, what's been, what needs to be done?

3397
02:54:07,280 --> 02:54:08,300
I'll do 98.

3398
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:10,700
92?

3399
02:54:11,560 --> 02:54:12,620
I'm doing 92.

3400
02:54:13,460 --> 02:54:13,900
Oh, you're doing it.

3401
02:54:13,940 --> 02:54:14,660
Okay, I'll do 93.

3402
02:54:15,220 --> 02:54:16,020
Was it 92?

3403
02:54:16,220 --> 02:54:17,340
Did I misread it again?

3404
02:54:18,720 --> 02:54:20,360
Oh, there is 92, yes.

3405
02:54:25,500 --> 02:54:26,820
Oh, it's 90.

3406
02:54:27,800 --> 02:54:29,360
Okay, I just did a drink for 90.

3407
02:54:29,620 --> 02:54:30,960
I keep reading the zeros.

3408
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:34,960
I can't read.

3409
02:54:36,620 --> 02:54:37,820
Uh, two patty.

3410
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:39,280

3411
02:54:39,380 --> 02:54:42,040
Oh, no!

3412
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:47,360
Oh, no!

3413
02:54:47,960 --> 02:54:49,100
Okay, I got it.

3414
02:54:49,300 --> 02:54:50,180
Oh, I snuffing.

3415
02:54:50,220 --> 02:54:51,180
I got snub.

3416
02:54:51,860 --> 02:54:52,420
Snub.

3417
02:54:55,440 --> 02:54:57,000
Oh, come on.

3418
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:59,100
Not take fry.

3419
02:54:59,360 --> 02:55:01,060
Okay, it's, uh...

3420
02:55:02,780 --> 02:55:03,440
One cheese.

3421
02:55:04,960 --> 02:55:05,840
Yeah, I'm doing 90.

3422
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:06,640
I'm trying.

3423
02:55:07,560 --> 02:55:08,080
I'm trying.

3424
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:08,720
Oh, gosh.

3425
02:55:09,660 --> 02:55:10,200
I'm trying.

3426
02:55:10,640 --> 02:55:11,620
There's an attempt.

3427
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:17,780
It's so difficult!

3428
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:20,440
I never did make my soda, hold on.

3429
02:55:20,820 --> 02:55:21,920
Uh, and that's it.

3430
02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:22,320
Okay.

3431
02:55:22,700 --> 02:55:23,260
Wait, oh!

3432
02:55:23,320 --> 02:55:24,560
Well, having zero gravity?

3433
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:26,380
90.

3434
02:55:27,260 --> 02:55:28,220
Fire up!

3435
02:55:29,020 --> 02:55:30,320
90, 90, 90!

3436
02:55:30,420 --> 02:55:31,240
Where are you?

3437
02:55:32,580 --> 02:55:33,060
90!

3438
02:55:38,270 --> 02:55:38,750
90!

3439
02:55:39,970 --> 02:55:41,370
Yeah, blah blah, blah, blah.

3440
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:48,240
Wait, why is it still up there though?

3441
02:55:50,860 --> 02:55:52,920
Why are the orders not going away?

3442
02:55:53,840 --> 02:55:54,920
Oh, they are for me.

3443
02:55:56,240 --> 02:55:57,940
Oh, they're not going away for me.

3444
02:55:58,100 --> 02:55:58,780
Oh, my God.

3445
02:55:59,540 --> 02:55:59,940
Oh, dear.

3446
02:56:00,280 --> 02:56:01,420
Okay, I gotta shoot around.

3447
02:56:01,440 --> 02:56:02,160
You need me an orange soda?

3448
02:56:03,240 --> 02:56:03,480
Yep.

3449
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:04,340
Okay.

3450
02:56:05,940 --> 02:56:07,400
Did anybody do 96?

3451
02:56:08,500 --> 02:56:10,060
No, I'm doing 90.

3452
02:56:10,200 --> 02:56:11,040
It's bugged again.

3453
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:11,400
Oh, no.

3454
02:56:11,540 --> 02:56:12,420
They've all desynced.

3455
02:56:12,780 --> 02:56:13,260
They've desynced.

3456
02:56:13,440 --> 02:56:14,780
I don't know what I'm making anymore.

3457
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:15,480
Oh!

3458
02:56:15,620 --> 02:56:16,660
There's an orange soda.

3459
02:56:17,720 --> 02:56:19,100
Oh, yeah, everything's decent.

3460
02:56:20,140 --> 02:56:21,720
Truly, that's some sort of like...

3461
02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:23,660
Oh, why are they raw?

3462
02:56:25,620 --> 02:56:27,500
Why are they raw?

3463
02:56:28,080 --> 02:56:34,060
I think we're fucked because the displays aren't updating properly.

3464
02:56:34,260 --> 02:56:35,860
We're so screwed!

3465
02:56:37,480 --> 02:56:41,220
Like, I keep seeing an order for ages and then it just randomly disappears.

3466
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:43,820
Yeah, even the things that...

3467
02:56:43,820 --> 02:56:45,440
Like, 85 is still up.

3468
02:56:46,680 --> 02:56:47,320
Yeah.

3469
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:47,760
Yeah.

3470
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:49,980
In 92...

02:57:37,300 --> 02:57:37,740
Yes.

3476
02:57:40,360 --> 02:57:41,400
We're going out in style.

3477
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:43,180
I think I'm actually immune to them now.

3478
02:57:45,720 --> 02:57:46,520
Where's the gun?

3479
02:57:46,660 --> 02:57:47,440
I just put it on.

3480
02:57:47,780 --> 02:57:48,940
Doki left it downstairs.

3481
02:57:49,420 --> 02:57:50,220
Careful, careful, careful.

3482
02:57:50,420 --> 02:57:51,620
The thing was in here a second ago.

3483
02:57:51,860 --> 02:57:52,200
Oh, okay.

3484
02:57:57,730 --> 02:57:58,570
Is it charging?

3485
02:57:58,850 --> 02:58:00,530
I see my smoke break.

3486
02:58:00,710 --> 02:58:01,270
Give me your neck.

3487
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:06,420
Smoke break.

3488
02:58:06,580 --> 02:58:07,800
The game's not functioning anymore.

3489
02:58:07,820 --> 02:58:08,860
It is.

3490
02:58:10,880 --> 02:58:12,040
Oh, it's showing me orders.

3507
02:59:27,220 --> 02:59:28,180
We're killing it.

3508
02:59:30,420 --> 02:59:32,220
Oh, we got Shrek in here.

3509
02:59:35,740 --> 02:59:36,760
Oh, shit.

3510
02:59:37,160 --> 02:59:38,120
Someone just freaked out.

3511
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:38,860
Why?

3512
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:39,380
Oh!

3513
02:59:46,910 --> 02:59:47,950
You're stuck again?

3514
02:59:48,790 --> 02:59:49,870
I'm stuck again.

3515
02:59:53,170 --> 02:59:54,390
I'm using the gun.

3516
03:00:00,690 --> 03:00:01,670
Oh, I killed him.

3517
03:00:03,570 --> 03:00:04,630
Wait, what else is happening?

3518
03:00:06,950 --> 03:00:08,170
Oh, there's a big guy.

3519
03:00:10,230 --> 03:00:11,090
There's a big guy.

3520
03:00:12,390 --> 03:00:12,790
Uh-oh.

3521
03:00:13,730 --> 03:00:14,670
Oh, the day's over.

3522
03:00:15,930 --> 03:00:16,990
I still killed him.

3523
03:00:18,250 --> 03:00:18,650
Oh.

3524
03:00:20,590 --> 03:00:21,550
Impressive work.

3525
03:00:21,830 --> 03:00:22,510
Mr. Strong.

3526
03:00:23,490 --> 03:00:24,210
Mr. What?

3527
03:00:24,490 --> 03:00:24,970
Strong.

3528
03:00:27,850 --> 03:00:28,690
You're free!

3529
03:00:28,910 --> 03:00:29,430
You're free!

3530
03:00:31,030 --> 03:00:31,670
I'm free!

3531
03:00:31,890 --> 03:00:33,570
How many patties do you think this guy is?

3532
03:00:33,570 --> 03:00:35,910
Why is Doki throwing Doki away?

3533
03:00:36,250 --> 03:00:37,570
No, I'm just...

3534
03:00:37,570 --> 03:00:40,170
If one feels just like a customer, I want to know what's right.

3535
03:00:40,570 --> 03:00:41,810
Wait, why is your body there?

3536
03:00:42,910 --> 03:00:45,390
Because I thought Doki would get grabbed.

3537
03:00:46,310 --> 03:00:47,890
But I didn't pay the bench, man.

3538
03:00:48,450 --> 03:00:50,030
I didn't pay the bench ball.

3539
03:00:50,350 --> 03:00:52,130
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3540
03:00:52,550 --> 03:00:53,070
Whoa!

3541
03:00:53,690 --> 03:00:54,210
Whoa!

3542
03:00:55,150 --> 03:00:56,230
But again, he starts twerking.

3543
03:00:57,110 --> 03:00:59,290
I can't even grab, oh there we go.

3544
03:00:59,290 --> 03:01:00,810
Oh, that's scary.

3545
03:01:00,970 --> 03:01:01,650
Yep, yeah.

3546
03:01:01,950 --> 03:01:02,710
Woo, woo!

3547
03:01:03,250 --> 03:01:03,250
Woo!

3548
03:01:03,710 --> 03:01:03,910
Woo!

3549
03:01:06,290 --> 03:01:06,690
Yeah!

3550
03:01:09,850 --> 03:01:10,650
Very good.

3551
03:01:15,890 --> 03:01:17,710
Do it again, Mr. Strong.

3552
03:01:19,290 --> 03:01:22,390
Did someone just pay the rent or did we just lose $400 for no reason?

3553
03:01:22,410 --> 03:01:23,430
No, I pay the rent.

3554
03:01:23,930 --> 03:01:24,090
Okay.

3555
03:01:25,250 --> 03:01:27,790
We paid the rent!

3556
03:01:28,550 --> 03:01:31,310
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3557
03:01:32,310 --> 03:01:33,270
Not enough.

3558
03:01:34,290 --> 03:01:35,830
I wish we could live amongst them.

3559
03:01:35,890 --> 03:01:38,990
I would say that the Sloppy sisters have moved on up.

3560
03:01:39,670 --> 03:01:40,850
Yeah, I think so too.

3561
03:01:41,750 --> 03:01:45,010
Also, Nimi did a lot of fry cooking, which is so appropriate, and I love that.

3562
03:01:45,090 --> 03:01:45,390
I know.

3563
03:01:46,030 --> 03:01:47,370
Our side of Nimi fries.

3564
03:01:48,910 --> 03:01:49,590
I love it.

3565
03:01:49,590 --> 03:01:50,330
Look at that, guys.

3566
03:01:51,210 --> 03:01:53,610
The franchise and the success, guys.

3567
03:01:56,530 --> 03:02:28,930
space look they're fighting like pokemon oh that's yeah fighting but they've actually the save stays intact if we didn't fail it so we can keep that for next time if you want oh yeah oh yeah definitely coming back yeah i thought i thought honestly if they like the working service and shooting it without the order screens i think it would be really good yeah oh oh not the both the lighting and going

3568
03:02:35,960 --> 03:02:36,880
into space

3569
03:02:42,560 --> 03:03:06,220

That's my job.

03:03:12,420 --> 03:03:13,180
You just left.

3574
03:03:13,340 --> 03:03:15,280
I was the one who turned it on.

3575
03:03:19,480 --> 03:03:21,380
My brain is like, I gotta keep guys.

3576
03:03:22,160 --> 03:03:23,420
You can stop.

3577
03:03:23,560 --> 03:03:24,620
Snuffy, we're finishing.

3578
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:25,380
We're done.

3579
03:03:25,660 --> 03:03:28,080
Oh my god, wait, but all these patties wasted.

3580
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:30,800
They are wasted, but that's okay.

3581
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:31,580
That's okay.

3582
03:03:31,780 --> 03:03:32,260
It's for the ride.

3583
03:03:32,460 --> 03:03:32,860
Here, here.

3584
03:03:33,060 --> 03:03:33,820
Here, you get one?

3585

Yeah, I get one.

3586
03:03:35,740 --> 03:03:36,880
I get one on it.

3587
03:03:37,540 --> 03:03:37,740
Yeah.

3588
03:03:38,380 --> 03:03:39,200
Yeah, there you go.

3589
03:03:39,400 --> 03:03:40,200
Run me with the day.

3590
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:41,440
Of course for you.

3591
03:03:41,520 --> 03:03:42,620
Wait, there's enough for everybody.

3592
03:03:45,100 --> 03:03:47,140
Let's burn this place down.

3593
03:03:47,480 --> 03:03:48,680
Let's burn this place down.

3594
03:03:50,580 --> 03:03:50,820
Wait.

3595
03:03:51,180 --> 03:03:51,780
Can we learn?

3596
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:53,550
I don't think they work when the thing's off.

3597
03:03:54,260 --> 03:03:54,520
Dang.

3598
03:03:57,600 --> 03:03:58,060
Oh!

3599
03:03:58,260 --> 03:03:58,860
Thanks, Doki.

3600
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:00,480
Oh, come on.

3601
03:04:01,420 --> 03:04:01,860
Whoa.

3602
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:04,580
Who said that?

3603
03:04:04,920 --> 03:04:05,160
Oh.

3604
03:04:05,160 --> 03:04:06,240
Wait,

3605
03:04:09,910 --> 03:04:12,290
you're alive?

3606
03:04:15,230 --> 03:04:15,830
Yes.

3607
03:04:16,650 --> 03:04:17,530
We're the strongest.

3608
03:04:19,130 --> 03:04:20,210
Are you hiding behind me?

3609
03:04:22,690 --> 03:04:23,030
Ow!

3610
03:04:26,320 --> 03:04:29,040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3611
03:04:29,140 --> 03:04:30,160
Oh, shit, I'm dead.

3612
03:04:33,360 --> 03:04:34,680
Give me a sec.

3613
03:04:48,220 --> 03:04:50,080
No, I don't.

3614
03:04:50,360 --> 03:04:51,340
No, I don't.

3615
03:04:52,140 --> 03:04:53,400
Kill me in here.

3616
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:55,220
I'll just revive!

3617
03:04:57,260 --> 03:04:58,940
Don't do it!

3618
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:04,060
Oh dang it, I missed.

3619
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:07,820
I don't want to play with a U.

3620
03:05:08,220 --> 03:05:09,240
I don't want to...

3621
03:05:09,820 --> 03:05:10,800
You're gonna cheat!

3622
03:05:11,140 --> 03:05:13,360
You're gonna use your FPS stuff!

3623
03:05:21,380 --> 03:05:24,420
You shot my leg, you didn't shoot my head.

3624
03:05:24,500 --> 03:05:24,960
Oh dang.

3625
03:05:26,340 --> 03:05:28,380
Yeah, go with.

3626
03:05:31,180 --> 03:05:32,300
Wait, where are you?

3627
03:05:32,440 --> 03:05:32,940
Oh.

3628
03:05:34,400 --> 03:05:36,020
Yeah, you gotta shoot me one.

3629
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:37,220
I won't.

3630
03:05:37,320 --> 03:05:37,740
I won't.

3631
03:05:39,080 --> 03:05:39,680
No!

3632
03:05:52,260 --> 03:05:54,500
I just wanted to end it.

3633
03:05:54,800 --> 03:05:57,120
We couldn't leave the purgatory.

3634
03:05:57,460 --> 03:05:58,000
Kill Doki.

3635
03:05:58,200 --> 03:05:59,800
Kill Doki, then we can end it.

3636
03:06:00,340 --> 03:06:01,440
Oh, sorry, Nimi!

3637
03:06:03,720 --> 03:06:05,200
Wait, what got me?

It was a pleasure.

3659
03:08:12,820 --> 03:08:13,900
I took my hot tea.

3660
03:08:13,900 --> 03:08:15,160
Go for it.

3661
03:08:15,400 --> 03:08:16,020
Sorry, Lymo.

3662
03:08:16,460 --> 03:08:17,200
I didn't eat that.

3663
03:08:17,240 --> 03:08:17,720
What the fuck, Meg?

3664
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:19,520
Microaggressions.

3665
03:08:19,620 --> 03:08:20,340
God damn.

3666
03:08:23,560 --> 03:08:25,640
You were the manager, Lymo.

3667
03:08:26,120 --> 03:08:27,640
You were you deserved it.

3668
03:08:27,980 --> 03:08:29,000
Wait, you killed us all.

3669
03:08:29,740 --> 03:08:31,760
We all talk smack when you turn corn.

3670
03:08:31,960 --> 03:08:35,440
We're like, God, that Lymo, she smells so good like a nice citrus.

3671
03:08:35,900 --> 03:08:36,380
What?

3672
03:08:36,740 --> 03:08:36,880
What?

3673
03:08:38,560 --> 03:08:40,480
Even her face looks like a Lymo.

3674
03:08:41,360 --> 03:08:41,620
Yeah.

3675
03:08:42,740 --> 03:08:43,220
Yeah.

3676
03:08:43,360 --> 03:08:43,880
He's coming.

3677
03:08:43,900 --> 03:08:46,040
She's kind of, she smells kind of like a ferret.

3678
03:08:46,240 --> 03:08:46,640
I don't know.

3679
03:08:47,260 --> 03:08:48,940
I like the way it's like a ferret spell.

3680
03:08:49,100 --> 03:08:50,200
I think it's a good spell.

3681
03:08:50,620 --> 03:08:51,880
Yeah, you have aura.

3682
03:08:52,200 --> 03:08:52,820
Go sleep.

3683
03:08:53,220 --> 03:08:53,740
Go sleep.

3684
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,360
Yeah, it's like 2 a.m.

3685
03:08:55,360 --> 03:08:56,300
Well, it was 2 a.m.

3686
03:08:56,740 --> 03:08:58,320
Good night, everybody.

3687
03:08:58,600 --> 03:08:59,720
Good night, everyone.

3688
03:09:08,180 --> 03:09:09,560
That game was crazy.

3689
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:10,480
Oh, my gosh.

3690
03:09:10,500 --> 03:09:14,340
It's like it took that restaurant game and like, whoa, whoa, sorry.

3691
03:09:14,500 --> 03:09:15,440
Lethal Company.

3692
03:09:16,160 --> 03:09:21,240
Like, all these, it's like it took those, all the friend slop games and threw it into one game.

3693
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:23,680
Yay!

3694
03:09:24,920 --> 03:09:25,720
Yay, yay, yay, yay!

3695
03:09:25,820 --> 03:09:26,580
It was so silly.

3696
03:09:27,620 --> 03:09:38,580
It's like we leveled up from the first sloppy collab to, like, where we were still working at a restaurant, but we were, we've leveled up to aliens.

3697
03:09:40,280 --> 03:09:41,020
Thank you, Dorgo!

3698
03:09:41,540 --> 03:09:43,740
