1
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

2
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,490
Hello, hello.

3
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,230
Hi.

4
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,610
Hello, hello.

5
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,630
I'm nervous.

6
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:07,210
I choose karaoke streams to make me less nervous sometimes, but then also the karaoke stream itself makes me nervous.

7
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,460
This is a dollar for every night that I've listened to you sing, Harvest Moon.

8
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Should I sing it tonight as well, even though it's not the Harvest Moon?

9
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,520
Today, I've chosen a little bit more of a chilly vibe.

10
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,060
Thank you!

11
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,240
Thank you.

12
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,360
Remember that time you did karaoke to calm your nerves before Big Dana worked out like that?

13
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:48,460
actually I know but I get nervous for the karaoke too I

14
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:05,840
might lose service by the time you start but me too is cool I don't know if you're still here hello what's I gonna do oh I was gonna do this I'm

15
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,250

16
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,830
A cough, not a cough drop.

17
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,170
This one's open.

18
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,490
I have so many things for my throat.

19
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:32,770
Thank you so much for the 50 gift and thank you!

20
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,670
Hello everybody, welcome in.

21
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,470

22
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,910

23
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,530

24
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:50,910

27
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,660
Invisible Moose, thank you so much for the 20 here today, Kube.

29
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,720
It's weird.

30
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,080
things like this are so strange.

31
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,040
Like, planning stuff.

32
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:46,940
It's always like, and this doesn't just go for, like, VTubers, but, like, Oh my gosh, Dermatio, thank you so much for the 50.

33
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,000
Thank you!

34
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,980
Oh, that's right.

35
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,820
Oh, chat froze.

36
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,880
Why does it keep happening?

37
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,580
And freeze!

38
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,820
There we go.

39
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,880
Oh, wrong chat.

40
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,420
Oh my gosh, I just realized.

41
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,320
I think it's the... I think I was practicing.

42
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,600
I think that is the debut chat.

43
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,280
That's so funny.

44
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,120
Oops.

45
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,820
I just didn't even question... Ah, there you guys are.

46
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,260
I didn't even question it.

47
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:52,420
oopsie but um you know when you're like this is like for projects for anything you know you like spend all this time prepping and all this time stressing and all this time preparing and then as soon as it comes it's over in like you know for me it'll be over in an hour and it's like all this and for me it's also weird because like

48
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:03,640
Phoebe's changing a couple things Vicky is straight up debuting but for me not much is changing so I'm like why am I

49
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:22,240
nervous not much is really changing for me I guess you know the sound of saying debut or it's like the start of something new in a sense because it's the start of the three of us together but

50
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:41,560
but in terms of like streaming and stuff nothing's gonna change you're gonna make a lot of fans pregnant tomorrow tomorrow why i'm seeing sweet caroline sweet caroline

51
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,260
It happens.

52
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,740
You are about to start a new journey.

53
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,180
I guess that's kind of true.

54
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,920
That is kind of true.

55
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,360
Not kind of.

56
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,960
It is true.

57
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,340
I mean, it is the start of something new.

58
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,080
We're gonna do our best with it.

59
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,720
You're nervous because it's going to be awesome!

60
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,780
And you're always nervous before awesome things.

61
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,260
I...

62
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,340
I...

63
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,600
You know, I have a few new things prepared.

64
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,220
A few new things to kind of make it a little bit shinier.

65
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:34,980
For the most part, I didn't want to make it seem all new, because, you know, like I said, for the most part, things will be staying the same.

66
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,360
So, make today a graduation stream.

67
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:41,960
No!

68
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,520
You guys would kill me!

69
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,140
I'm already dead!

70
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,240
And you would be like...

71
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,000
You would be like...

72
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,810
But, um...

73
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,130
Yeah, where's the white background and the smiling and the slight breeze in my hair?

74
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:14,850
And our little hearts.

75
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,830
I don't even want to joke about stuff like that, so.

76
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,770
Excited for it.

77
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,250
Have fun.

78
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,810
Yeah, we'll just have fun.

79
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,730
Minto karaoke before Denza 2.exe.

80
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,290
You're spoiling us.

81
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:26,610
MVP.

82
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,810
Yeah, MVP.

83
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,910
Please know.

84
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,090
No, no, no, I'm not.

85
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,730
Densetsu.exe, does that make...

86
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,890
Densu.exe, does that make...

87
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,430
Mint the ghost in the machine?

88
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:41,910
Ah!

89
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,470
The shorts you guys have been releasing and build up to tomorrow's debut had me dying of laughter.

90
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,930
A lot of the shorts, basically...

91
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,310
Oh my gosh.

92
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,050
I feel like we should release an extended cut or something because the shorts are all basically...

93
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,790
Most of them are taken from one...

94
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,750
session.

95
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:10,690
The three of us kind of met up and then just like talked for like an hour or something.

96
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,910
Minto was always an idol, but soon more will know.

97
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,390
I don't know.

98
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,570
Yeah, a lot of stuff was cut out.

99
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,610
Um, it felt like a podcast.

100
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,970
Yeah, we were just like, we were just chatting about everything and anything.

101
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:28,990
We were just like,

102
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,210
Oh!

103
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,930
Oh my gosh, before I start singing, can I show you guys something?

104
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,610
I can finally show you this, which is kind of crazy.

105
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,090
Hold on.

106
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:47,090
I can finally maybe satisfy some curious folks.

107
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,810
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for all the super chats, you guys.

108
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,270
Thank you, Shiny Dears.

109
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,090
I should start writing things down, huh?

110
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,330
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

111
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,450
Release the Minto cut.

112
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,750
Thank you so much.

113
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,490
Okay, hold on.

114
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,370
Not the wet wang.

115
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,910
so there was a collab bond

116
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:37,970
yes okay all right here we go this might look familiar to some of you all hopefully all of you so i hope all of you watch this oh wait hold on whoa familiar familiar right some of you might have i saw a few comments some people noticed that there was a point of silence.

117
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,930
Oh my god.

118
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,790
Spooked, man.

119
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:46,910
Oh, nope.

120
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:47,390
Not yet.

121
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,770
Wait, there we go.

122
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,730
I can satisfy all your curiosity.

123
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,370
I actually had to censor that, or I had to silence that manually.

124
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:16,130
Once again, changed locations and I got to sing with my favorite girlies.

125
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:24,230
ever phoebe and vicky thank you guys did the two exe yeah that's it i

126
00:14:40,380 --> 00:15:03,280
was like we were stressing actually we were high key stressing we were like they were like you have to cut the song and i was like i can't cut the song and so ultimately it i felt so terrible ultimately it it made it so that vicky would like like and everything early,

127
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,200
like, it was, it was, it was, we were like, what do we do?

128
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,700
What do we do?

129
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,460
Because we were like, do we keep it a secret?

130
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,600
Like, super secret until, until everything do, we had to, all because of that.

131
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,420
Literally all because of the song.

132
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,280
And then I was like, well, I can't cut the MC afterwards.

133
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,780
Like, it wouldn't make sense.

134
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,980
But then I don't know.

135
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,860
So.

136
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:40,180
We kind of figured out, as you see what happened, that's kind of how we decided to do it.

137
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,300
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Vicky.

138
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,040
I think she was okay with it, though.

139
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,440
I think she had a lot of fun making all of her videos and everything.

140
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,040
Calling Din Setsu Da Ixia 3A.

141
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,980
I'm not clickbait.

142
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,980
Where can I see that cover?

143
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,260
That's a great question.

144
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,440
You can see that cover in my 3D debut.

145
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:27,000

Hold on, let me look at that.

149
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,680
It's like a stretchy Shadow the Hedgehog.

150
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,060
I was like, I bought this for you.

151
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,860
And then she was like, oh my gosh, I've seen these before on TikTok.

152
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,500
People will cut off his limbs and then fill it with water and watch him expand.

153
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,940
And I was like, but also, Vicky, I went to the Lego store recently and I got you a little Lego...

I wonder what you would get.

159
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,840
Maybe you'll get the TikTok video.

160
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,860
Just dig around a little bit.

161
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,240
Membership placeholder for Vicky Roman.

Okie dokie I wish

185
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:44,100
I knew the Hugh Jackman version Where it began I can't begin to know when But then I know it's growing strong When it was the spring.

186
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,260
And spring became the summer.

187
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,740
Who'd I believe you'd come along?

188
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,140
Touching hands.

189
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,980
Reaching out.

190
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,260
Touching me.

191
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,440
Touching you.

192
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,720
Sweet Caroline.

193
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,520
Breadbread.

194
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:18,720
Breadbread.

195
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,660
The times never seem so good, so good, so good!

196
00:21:26,060 --> 00:22:25,970
I've been inclined, bread, bread, bread To believe they never would, but Look at the night And it don't seem so lonely We fill it up with only two the bread thing after sorry and when i hurt hurting runs off my shoulders how can i hurt when holding you warm touching warm reaching out touching me Keep touching you.

197
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,590
Sweet Caroline.

198
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,890
Bread, bread, bread.

199
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,430
Good times never seem so good.

200
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,330
So good.

201
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,430
So good.

202
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,270
So good.

203
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,390
So good.

204
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:46,090
I've been inclined to believe they never would.

205
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,790
Oh, no.

206
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,580
Oh my gosh.

207
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,600
I wonder if we could even find karaoke versions a lot.

208
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,420
Sweet Caroline, ba ba ba, the dance never seems so good.

209
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,200
So good!

210
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,040
And go!

211
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,860
And go!

212
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:21,680
Sweet Caroline, I believe they never could.

213
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:35,080
Caroline The dance never seemed so good So good, yeah

214
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,100
I forgot to ask How was the audio?

215
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,780
How was the sound on that?

216
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,360
I was just like using it as a test song And I got so into it I forgot to test if it was too loud or not

217
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,020
It was good?

218
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:29,180
Okay, good, good, good Okay, so Hugh Jackman played he's he is in a maybe it's released now i don't know an upcoming maybe question mark movie about neil diamond or a guy no a guy that played an impersonator of neil diamond i'm so confused the song was the song my family sang my grandma for her birthday oh so sweet huge jacked man name.

219
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Yeah.

220
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,120
And Hugh Jackman played the guy.

221
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,080
Oh, gosh.

222
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,620
Jean, Jean, Jean, Jean, Jean Valjean in Le Maze.

223
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,860
And, and the way he sings is very, like, specific.

224
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,560
Jean Valjean.

225
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,100
Yeah, Jean Valjean.

226
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,920
And, oh, prisoner six, two, eight, oh, one.

227
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:56,000
why should we sing some lemmas but um so because Hugh Jackman has this very specific way of singing and he sings sweet Caroline he's like sweet Caroline and there's like this guy who sorry this is like the most convoluted explanation ever but there's this guy who does like parody videos of Hugh of like like pretending or acting like he's or singing like how Hugh Jackman sings and then replaces the lyrics to songs with bread because that's what happened in Le Messe is Jean Valjean got arrested because he stole a loaf of bread and so as a bass singer that song is like what do I go to it's really it's like such a hype song everybody knows sweet Caroline

228
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,200
And he's like, I stole a loaf of bread.

229
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,840
It's so funny.

230
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,040
The way he sings is so specific.

231
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,560
I stole a loaf of bread.

232
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,900
Okay, oh gosh, my brain rot is very multi-layered.

233
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,880
Yes, yes, indeed.

234
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,660
Francis Hardcore, man.

235
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,540
I don't know.

236
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,060
Do you hear the purple sing?

237
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,380
Singing the song.

238
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,740
What is that one?

239
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,720
I don't even know.

240
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,500
I could sing.

241
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,640
What is a L'Ameselable song?

242
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,640
Um.

243
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,240
Song of Angry Bread.

244
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,100
Sing on my own.

245
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,680
Okay.

246
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,920
I'll sing.

247
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:08,620
that wait that's such a it's i feel like it matches the vibes of my sad winter setup

248
00:27:23,240 --> 00:28:05,540
and now i'm all alone again nowhere to turn no one to go to without a hope without a friend without a face to say hello to but now the night is near now i can make wait oh gosh sometimes i walk alone at night when everybody else is sleeping i think of him and then i'm happy with the company wait what's the what's the note here the city goes to bed and i can live inside my head

249
00:28:09,700 --> 00:29:25,200
on my own pretending he beside me all alone I walk with him till morning without him I feel his arms around me and when I close wait let's wait I've said the wrong word in the rain the pavement shines like silver all the lights are misty in the river in the darkness the trees are full of starlight and all I see is him and me forever and forever and I I know it's only in my mind that I'm talking to myself and not to him.

250
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:39,920
And although I know that he is blind, still I say there's a way for us.

251
00:29:42,200 --> 00:30:20,820
I love him, but when the night is over He is gone, the river is just a river Without him, the world around me changes The trees are barren everywhere, the streets are full of strangers I love him, but every day I'm learning All my life, I've only been pretending Without me,

252
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:30,000
his world will go on turning A world that's full of happiness that I have never known

253
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:51,910
I love him I love him Solid snake I love snake But only on...

254
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,020
The self-insert.

255
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,860
Yeah, sorry.

256
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,700
Got a little carried away there.

257
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,000
Let me... I also realized I forgot to turn off...

258
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,580
I haven't heard one, but I forgot to turn off sounds for the doughnuts.

259
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,000
So let me...

260
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,140
Do that real quickly.

261
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,020
One moment.

262
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:43,580
I don't even know if one has shown up or not.

263
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,600
I don't know if they're like buried beneath a bunch of stuff.

264
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,420
Minto sounds like a princess?

265
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,100
I do.

266
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,960
Thank you.

267
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,000
Wicked?

268
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,680
Oh, don't even.

269
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,880
Oh my gosh, wait.

270
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,200
My wicked brain right, though.

271
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:46,220
for it now which wicked song which wicked song be nice if they made a mute all toggle i know right i feel like at this point they could but okay save and then i have to remember what because they're not all the same volume save save save popular i love popular we could do multiple oh my gosh a of people saying popular okay i'll do popular popular uh oh wait do i do the ariana grande version or the christian chenoweth version um

272
00:32:49,440 --> 00:33:08,180
i'm more familiar with the original so i'll do that version whenever i see someone less fortunate than i and let's face it who is Less fortunate than I, my tender heart tends to start to bleed.

273
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,640
And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take over.

274
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,940
I know, I know exactly what they need.

275
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:31,440
And even in your case, though it's the toughest case I've yet to face, Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed.

276
00:33:32,660 --> 00:34:04,360
Follow my lead And yes, indeed, you will be popular You're gonna be popular I'll teach you the proper poise when you talk to boys Little ways to flirt and flounce I'll show you what shoes to wear How to fix your hair Everything that really counts to be popular I'll help you be popular.

277
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,840
You'll hang with the right cohorts.

278
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,260
You'll be good at sports.

279
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,720
Know the slang you've got to know.

280
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,520
So let's start because you've got an awfully long way to go.

281
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,280
Don't be offended by my frank analysis.

282
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,060
Think of it as personality dialysis.

283
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,340
Now that I've chosen to become a palisester and advisor, there's nobody wiser.

284
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,740
Not when it comes to popular.

285
00:34:32,780 --> 00:35:35,460
And with an assist from me to be who you'll be Instead of dreary who you were, well, are There's nothing that can stop you from becoming popular LAR La la la We're gonna make you popular When I see depressing creatures With unprepossessing features remind them on their own we have to think of celebrated heads of state or especially great communicators did they have brains or knowledge don't make me laugh they were popular right that's my favorite part of the movie version it's not about aptitude it's the way you're viewed so it's very shrewd to be very very popular like me Oh my gosh,

286
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,720
my Miss Alphaba.

287
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,980
Look at you.

288
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,200
You're beautiful.

289
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,620
Oh, whoa.

290
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,160
I have to go.

291
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,920
There's a lady here.

292
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,860
Oh my gosh.

293
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,920
You're welcome.

294
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:58,240
And though you protest your disinterest, I know clandestinely.

295
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,980
You're gonna grin and bury your newfound popularity.

296
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,750
La, la, la, you'll be popular.

297
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:18,690
Just not quite as popular as me.

298
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,450
I forgot to turn on reverb.

299
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,030
Oh my god.

300
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,470
Woman jump scare, woman jump scare.

301
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:35,210
That's another wicked song.

302
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,930
I forgot to warm up for today's stream, so I apologize in advance.

303
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,450
My favorite part of karaoke streams is seeing all the great names go, Make it sing!

304
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:48,690
No!

305
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,780
Is that Glinda?

306
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Look, it's Glinda!

307
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,220
Denny, the reverb?

308
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,860
Thank you.

309
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,420
Thank you.

310
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,360
That's not true.

311
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,660
What a wicked karaoke.

312
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,180
Defying gravity?

313
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:40,580
Galinda Galinda Look it's Galinda Let's see I can try Defying Gravity I can't Should I I guess the music or the musical version is like what makes the sorry wait I'm I have a million thoughts right now What is the difference between the film?

314
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,880
Because it's so much longer.

315
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,760
It's like seven and a half minutes long.

316
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,920
Go, Linda.

317
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,280
Go for it.

318
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,940
Thank you so much for the mic, Kat, and thank you.

319
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,620
I want to hear her sing that note.

320
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,720
The dialogue.

321
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,160
I can, let's see, let's see.

322
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,620
I might have to do both parts.

323
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,040
Oh, gosh.

324
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,400
Elphaba, why couldn't you have stayed calm for once, instead of flying off the handle?

325
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:31,920
I hope you're happy, I hope you're happy now, I hope you're happy how you hurt your cause forever, I hope you think you're clever, I hope you're happy, I hope you're happy too, I hope you're proud how you would grovel in submission to feed your own ambition,

326
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,520
so though I can't imagine how,

327
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,500
right now.

328
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,100
I had to add a voice.

329
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,740
Elfie, listen to me.

330
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,560
Just say you're sorry.

331
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:01,840
You can still be with the wizard, what you've worked and waited for.

332
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,400
You can have all you ever wanted.

333
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,220
I know.

334
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,760
But I don't want it.

335
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,020
I thought there was a cat in my room.

336
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:25,140
I can't want it anymore.

337
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,320
Oh, I was early, sorry.

338
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,080
Hold on.

339
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,420
My gravity.

340
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,930
Something has changed within me.

341
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,130
The pacing is all different.

342
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,970
It's not what I'm used to.

343
00:39:41,990 --> 00:41:12,750
something is not the same I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game too late for second guessing too late to go back to sleep it's time to trust my instincts close my eyes it's good and then one and leave it's time to try defying gravity I think I'll try defying gravity and you can't pull me down can't I make you understand you're having delusions of grandeur I'm through accepting limits it's slower Someone says they're so Some things I cannot change But till I try I'll never know Too long I've been afraid of Losing love I guess I've lost Well if that's love It comes at much too high a cost I'd sooner buy Defying gravity Kiss me good Oh boy,

344
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:24,350
I'm defying gravity And you can't pull me down This is, this is hard Why is it so slow?

345
00:41:25,490 --> 00:42:14,350
Think of what we could do together Unlimited Together we're unlimited Together we'll be the greatest team there's ever been dreams the way we plan them if we work in tandem there's no fight we cannot win just you and I defying gravity with you and I defying gravity they'll never shut up they'll bring us down I couldn't remember whose harmonies I was doing.

346
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,700
Are you coming?

347
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,640
Well, are you guys?

348
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,340
Are you guys?

349
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:28,800
Are you coming?

350
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
Are you coming?

351
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,220
I hope you're happy.

352
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,300
What is the note here?

353
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,420
Now that you're choosing this, you too.

354
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,100
I hope it brings you bliss.

355
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,740
I really hope you get it and you don't live to regret it.

356
00:42:49,400 --> 00:43:07,120
I hope you're happy in the end I hope you're happy, my friend No, let her alone!

357
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,940
She hasn't done anything wrong!

358
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,440
I'm the one you want!

359
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,100
This part's gonna make me laugh!

360
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:12,900
It's me!

361
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,860
It's me!

362
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,220
Me?

363
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:21,660
So if you care to find me, let the

364
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,620
one deserve the chance to fly.

365
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:37,380
And if I'm flying solo, at least I'm flying free.

366
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:43,460
To those who'd ground me, take a message back from me.

367
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:49,980
Tell them how I'm defying gravity.

368
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:00,580
I am defying the revenue And soon I'll match them in renown

369
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:15,340
I am not suited for Elfaba I'm more suited for Glinda, I think Unlimited

370
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:33,000
Unlimited Unlimited

371
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:55,130
Oh, nobody in all of us know wizard that there is or was is ever gonna bring me

372
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,370
down.

373
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:56,370
Did you guys ever see the commercials of Cynthia Arrivo being like, No, that's my line.

374
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,750
But people would like slow it down.

375
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:07,530
They'd be like, no, that's my line.

376
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,000
That's all I can think of.

377
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,740
Tarsan.

378
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,340
Oh, gosh.

379
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,420
Hello, by Adele.

380
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,380
The original singer is one of the highest vocal raids on Broadway.

381
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,500
Oh, Adina Madel, she's, like, insane.

382
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,200
That lady.

383
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,930
Sorry, I was, like, laughing.

384
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,370
I was, like, laughing, like, half the song.

385
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,250
I'm so sorry.

386
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,590
Oh, gosh.

387
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,450
I'm still nervous, so it's like...

388
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,490
Oh, gosh, okay.

389
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,770

Okay, what should I sing next?

395
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,380
I kind of want to sing Disney.

396
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,440
Oh, wait.

397
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,000
I think I know what I want to sing.

398
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,080
I think I know what I want to sing.

399
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:12,600
Okay, wait.

400
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,040
Hold on.

401
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,400
I have to make sure it's the right one.

402
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,380
One second.

403
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,360
Okay, okay.

404
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,560
I think so.

405
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,220
Okay.

406
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,540
Okay, okay.

407
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,620
Hold on, hold on.

408
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,300
I'm double checking.

409
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:32,860
I'm double checking.

410
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,860
Okay, wait.

411
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:36,620

412
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,660
Did I miss it?

413
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:42,900
Okay.

414
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,720

415
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Okay.

00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,680
Evermore!

417
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,700
I'll sing that one after.

418
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,400
Actually, maybe I should sing it first.

419
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,860
Can we play your song at our wedding?

420
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,640

M-O-U-S-E.

447
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:20,570
The ending is so scary.

448
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,130
It's like the...

449
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:29,630
Why is it such a cursed song?

450
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,170
Oh my god.

451
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:34,450
I'm sorry.

452
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,760
Okay, I'll sing evermore.

453
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,900
Wait, which is the right version?

454
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,580
I don't remember.

455
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:43,900
I think it's the right version.

456
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,920
I don't think I have to change the...

457
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,900
I always think this.

458
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,340
I'm like, do I have to change the pitch?

459
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,340
The key.

460
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,830
I only wanted to sing the Donald Duck.

461
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,280
I was the one who had it all.

462
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,860
I was the master of my fate.

463
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,560
I never needed anybody in my life.

464
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:34,580
I learned the truth too late.

465
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,400
I'll never shake away the pain.

466
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,500
I close my eyes but she's still there.

467
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,650
I let her steal into my melancholy heart.

468
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,580
It's more than I can bear.

469
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,560
But now I know she'll never leave.

470
00:54:00,580 --> 00:55:32,240
me even as she runs away she will still torment me call me hurt me move me come what may wasting in my lonely tower waiting by an open door I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in And be with me forevermore I rage against the trials of love I curse the fading of the light Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach She's never out of sight Now I know she'll never leave me Even as she fades from view She will still inspire me Be a part of everything I do Wasting in my lonely tower Waiting by an open door How full myself she'll walk right in And as the long,

471
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:44,180
long nights begin I'll think of all that might have been Waiting here forever

472
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:02,890
My lung capacity

473
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:07,710
Evermore.

474
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:08,690
Yippee!

475
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:11,990
All I ask of you are...

476
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,030
Twilight!

477
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,410
Wait, what's all I ask of you?

478
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:15,650
Wait.

479
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,590
I feel like I know that one.

480
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,090
Oh!

481
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,250
Phantom?

482
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:24,730
Oh, geez.

483
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,870
Getting all the...

484
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,550
The toughies, huh?

485
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,610
It's not easy being green.

486
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,830
It's not easy being green.

487
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,350
I don't know that song.

488
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,320
Everything's alright from To The Moon.

489
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,860
I didn't learn it yet.

490
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,760
A rainbow connection?

491
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,960
Wait, oh my gosh.

492
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,080
This song is so sweet.

493
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,230
Wait, can I do it as Kermit?

494
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Do I remember this song?

495
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:36,820
Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side?

496
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:48,880
Rainbows are visions but only illusions and rainbows have nothing to hide.

497
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:57,060
So we've been told and some choose to believe it.

498
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,960
I know they're wrong, wait and see.

499
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,260
Someday we'll find it.

500
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,900
The rainbow connection.

501
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,320
The lovers, the dreamers, and the frogberg.

502
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,170
Who said every wish is true?

503
00:58:22,190 --> 00:59:06,990
Would be heard and answered When wished on the morning star Somebody thought of that And someone believed it Look what it's done so far What's so amazing That keeps us stargazing think we might see someday we'll find it the rainbow connection the lovers the dreamers and me

504
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:25,820
i don't know this part wait oh my god have you been half asleep or have you heard voices.

505
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:30,720
I've heard them calling my name.

506
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:38,540
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?

507
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,460
The voice might be one and the same.

508
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:51,100
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.

509
00:59:51,700 --> 01:00:08,120
It's something that I'm supposed to someday we'll find it the rainbow connection the lovers the dreamers and me

Really?

513
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,740

Oh, she does.

558
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:32,030
Oh, that's what I was missing.

559
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:33,030
Rose.

560
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,790
Sorry, I was.

561
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:14,740
Oh, she does sing it.

562
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,380
Wait, maybe I should sing Bruno Mars' part then.

563
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,360
Maybe I should sing Bruno Mars' part then.

564

Oh my gosh, Lazy Town!

567
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:04,090
Let's see.

568
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:08,150
I don't think I've sung this Lavey song before, so I wanted to sing it, if that's okay.

569
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:43,590
Moved out to a new city, June is dawning down on me, and all that I can see.

570
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:46,030
Sickly romance in the air.

571
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:47,510
Lovers stroller.

572
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:48,910
Wait, stroller?

573
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:50,610
Where can I start over?

574
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:53,930
I didn't mean to say stroller.

575
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,870
Like, they're a baby.

576
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,180
Can I start over?

577
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:04,040
Sorry.

578
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,790
Moved out to a new city.

579
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:29,910
June is dawning down on me and all.

580
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,520
A sickly romance in the air.

581
01:07:37,680 --> 01:08:12,680
Love or stroll without a care inside Ooh, this can't be right Cause the sun's engaged to the sky And my best friends found a new guy I'm only getting older I've never had a shoulder to cry On someone to call mine Everybody's falling in love and I'm falling behind

582
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:33,520
Touch the ocean, fell right in Stepped outside and burned my skin My life won't go

583
01:08:37,100 --> 01:09:20,180
Barsanova in my room Hope that I'll find someone too to love Because The sun's engaged in the sky And my best friends found a new guy I'm only getting older I've never had a shoulder to cry On someone to combine Everybody's falling in love And I'm falling behind Everybody's falling in love Everybody's falling in love

584
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:31,550
Everybody's falling in love Me

585
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,310
One, two, three

586
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:04,870
Yay!

587
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:12,570
Okay, I didn't mess up the second time But it was really hard to not To not laugh

588
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,940
Yay, yay, yay.

589
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:22,840
Stroller.

590
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,640
Don't say it.

591
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,820
Don't say it!

592
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,120
I wonder what else.

593
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,720
What other levee?

594
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,600
I haven't done this one.

595
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,120
Actually, I haven't done a lot of these.

596
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:37,860
Oh.

597
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,900
Mintney Spears, maybe.

598
01:10:50,800 --> 01:11:06,080
thought about that song earlier snow white that's literally the song i was hovering over oh my gosh i'll try it i'll try it i've never sung about this one i'm gonna do with reverb though this is a sad song

599
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:12,460
can't help but notice

600
01:11:17,840 --> 01:12:03,460
waves in which i failed myself i failed the world all the say I don't think I'm pretty it's not up for debate a woman's best currencies her body not her brain they try to tell me tell me I'm wrong But mirrors tell lies to me, my mind just plays along.

601
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:13,000
The world is a sick place, at least for a girl.

602
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:24,020
The people want beauty, skinny always wins, and I don't have enough of it.

603
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:33,090
of it

604
01:12:36,730 --> 01:14:00,140
Sometimes I see her She looks like snow white She's everything I am But my wrongs are turned to rights Her body is smaller skin is so fair she's achieved everything I've dreamed of and it's all that I can think of they try to tell me tell me I'm wrong but mirrors tell lies to me my mind long the world is a sick place at least for a girl the people want beauty skinny always wins and i don't have enough of it i'll never have of it This song

605
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,120
is so sad.

606
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,340
Levi, are you okay?

607
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,900
Let's do a happy song next.

608
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:25,800
What's a happy song?

609
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,520
What's a happy song?

610
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,700
Ah,

611
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,720
DK rep.

612
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:37,720
So true.

613
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,470
Oh yeah, it didn't say Twilight, right, earlier?

614
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:53,430
Wait, I think I have to, like, adjust that song to...

615
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:58,180
Oh, was it...

616
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:00,860
Electric...

617
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:01,280
Light?

618
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,880
Was it taken down?

619
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,900
Oh my gosh, I don't see it anymore.

620
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:11,680
Oh no, there it is, just kidding.

621
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:12,500
Ha ha ha.

622
01:15:32,730 --> 01:16:10,190
Dancing in my mind The early dawn, the shades of time Twilight crawling through my window pane Am I awake or do I dream The strangest pictures I have seen Night is day and twilight's gone away With your head held high and your scarlet lies She came down to me from the open skies It's either real or it's a dream There's something that is in between Twilight,

623
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:25,290
I only meant to stay a while Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind away from me

624
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:42,260
Across the night I saw your face, face You disappear without a trace Trace, you brought me here But can you take me back?

625
01:16:43,880 --> 01:17:01,060
Inside the image of your life Now that, now that it's day You hurt my dyslexia You let me hear And then you go away Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,

626
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:08,480
bum It's a dream, there's nothing that is in between Twilight

627
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:29,140
Twilight To steal my mind Away from me I always, this song is such an otaku song, right?

628
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,880
I'm not the only one that thinks that, right?

629
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:38,400
You brought me here, but can you take me back again?

630
01:17:40,380 --> 01:18:09,400
With your head held high You're scarlet flies, you came down to me from the open skies It's either real or it's a dream, there's nothing that is in between Twilight, I only meant to stay a while Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind Bye-bye Twilight,

631
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:24,790
I only meant to stay a while I only meant to stay a while I only meant to stay a while Yeah!

632
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,330
You guys know!

633
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:48,880
I can't tell you how many times I watched that Daikon video Like an insane amount of time

634
01:18:52,810 --> 01:19:04,110
It's so good Reminds me of simpler times Reminds me of all the good times, man.

635
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:12,470
Oh my gosh, watching the Densetsu video makes me want to sing something like kind of Nico Nico.

636
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:16,170
And that song also makes me want to sing kind of Nico Nico.

637
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:19,750
Opportunity Nicholas Lourdes!

638
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:20,710
Happy birthday!

639
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:22,050
Happy, happy birthday!

640
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:25,510
Happy birthday.

641
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:28,130
An encapsulation of pop culture from that time, right?

642
01:19:30,630 --> 01:20:01,470

Why did I switch?

644
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:05,170
I don't remember.

645
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:07,830
I almost sang that one, though.

646
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:09,870
Linger.

647
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:10,590
Linger.

648
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:11,850
I think I...

649
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:12,770
I know that one.

650
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:13,310
I'm pretty sure.

651
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:15,530
I think so.

652
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:18,170
I might get some of it wrong.

653
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:18,650
I'm sorry.

654
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:29,350
I'm writing some more songs down.

655
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:31,550
Bye.

656
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:32,330
If you, if you could return Don't let it burn, don't let it fade I'm sure I'm not being rude, but it's just your attitude It's tearing me apart It's ruining everything and I and I swore I swore I would be true

657
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:40,050
So why were you holding her hand?

658
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,490
Is that the way we stand?

659
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:45,010
Were you lying all the time?

660
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:47,430
Was it just a game to you?

661
01:21:47,950 --> 01:22:27,030
But I'm in so deep You know I'm such a fool for you You got me wrapped around your finger do you have to let it linger do you have to do you have to do you have to let it linger oh i thought the world of you i thought nothing could wait go wrong but i was wrong wait i didn't remember this part i'm sorry

662
01:22:30,670 --> 01:23:05,970
If you could get by trying not to lie Things wouldn't be so confused And I wouldn't feel so used But you always really knew I just wanna be with you And I'm in so deep You know I'm such a fool for you You got me wrapped around your feet Do you have to let it linger?

663
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:07,370
Do you have to?

664
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:08,570
Do you have to?

665
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:09,070
Do you have to?

666
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:11,810
Do you have to let it linger?

667
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:37,380
But I'm in so deep, you know I'm such a fool for you.

668
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,540
You got me wrapped around your finger.

669
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,480
Do you have to, let it linger?

670
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,760
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to, let it linger?

671
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:06,680
You know I'm such a fool for you You got me wrapped around your finger Do you have to, let it linger?

672
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:11,760
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

673
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:50,870
I know what I'm going to sing next.

674
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:53,890
Oh, wait, which one was it?

675
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:54,930
Was it this one?

676
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:56,510
Wait, which one was it?

677
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,370
Wait, which one was it?

678
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:00,410
Is it this one?

679
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:03,110
Don't remember.

680
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,460
I think so.

681
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:14,900
I'll

682
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,740
be closer.

683
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:39,100
what I have to say Just

684
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:53,830
like children we sleep in We could dream this night away

685
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:11,880
But there's a full moon rising Let's go dancing in the night Where

686
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:28,060
the music's playing Let's go out and feel that night

687
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:55,680
Because I'm still in love with you I wanna see you dance again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moon And

688
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:20,510
we were strangers I have watched you from afar Now

689
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:47,840
it's getting late

690
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:12,950
I want to celebrate See it shining in your life Because

691
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:38,270
I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moon So

692
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:49,110
much for the best he gets in the text!

693
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:44,740
Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again Because I'm still in love with you On this harvest moon

694
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:13,140
We'll get all these similar ones out of the way Similar vibes

695
01:30:18,560 --> 01:31:06,460
Oh my gosh, groove and magic I heard this song recently Over the county And I drive the main road Searching in the sun for another overlord I hear you singing in the wire I can hear you through the wire And the witch's alignment Is still on the line

696
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:55,200
I know I need a small vacation But it don't look like rain And if it snows that stretch down south Won't ever stand the strain And I need you more than want you And I want you for all time And the wizard's alignment Is still on the line

697
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:37,360
And I need you more than want you And I want you for all time And the witch in alignment

698
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,360
It's still on the line.

699
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:20,790
Hey, thank you guys.

700
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:21,910
Thank you, thank you.

701
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:23,050
That was a witch-taught lineman.

702
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:24,990
Wait, that was like a back-to-back.

703
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:27,430
Wait, what was I, what did I, I did a back-to-back?

704
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:30,890
Linger, harvest moon, witch-taught lineman.

705
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:38,210
I realized, I think tomorrow I'm gonna save the Nico Nico songs.

706
01:33:38,850 --> 01:34:06,990
I have, I wanna sing a couple songs tomorrow so I think I'll save it for them and I already picked out what songs I want to sing so they're two very like Otaku songs that I have that I want to sing so I'll save it for tomorrow Killy Killy Joker though so I remember that well enough I didn't like learn it learn it because I you know I know the chorus for sure

707
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:21,050
It's so hard, John.

708
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:23,830
Wait, Killie Joker.

709
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:29,450
It's thinking Kanon Wakushima, so it's like...

710
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:31,230
She has a wait, what's the other song?

711
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:33,150
Oh, that's...

712
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:34,970
Hi, Miss Alice.

713
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:36,030
Anna.

714
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:39,330
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

715
01:34:39,690 --> 01:34:40,690
Ba-da.

716
01:34:41,790 --> 01:34:43,730
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da.

717
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:45,230
Wait, Killie, Killie Joker.

718
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:46,930
Is there an instrumental, let's say?

719
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:49,650
There is.

720
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,430
I don't think I can sing it, though.

721
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:53,110
Not today.

722
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:54,630
Tomorrow's my birthday!

723
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:58,810
I should have a happy early birthday, happy early birthday!

724
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:04,110
I think I could do Still Doll, though.

725
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:09,170
I think I remember it, because I did that song like Crazy!

726
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:15,210
I wasn't even a vampire knight girlie even.

727
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:19,710
but I'll try it.

728
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:23,290
Let's see.

729
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:28,030
Oh my gosh, it's so...

730
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:30,350
I haven't heard this song in like a decade.

731
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:32,990
Let's see how well I can do it.

732
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:56,410
I miss Alice.

733
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,240
¶¶

734
01:36:52,180 --> 01:37:01,160
I think I didn't choose Kili Kili Joker was because one of Wakeshima Kanon's...

735
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:12,240
She's a beautiful cello player, so it was mostly cello than singing, and I was like, oh my gosh, I'm gonna have to come up with like crazy choreo for it.

736
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,220
I miss Alice.

737
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:25,340
I'm going to use the fruit of the fruit.

738
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,940
I'm going to give you love.

739
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:43,640
I'm going to give you the words.

740
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:46,580
I'm going to make my words.

741
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:10,800
Still you do not answer

742
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:38,470
Oh, sorry, I forgot to change the song.

743
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:40,970
That was still dull.

744
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:42,490
Dool.

745
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:43,670
Still dull.

746
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:47,310
Oh, my gosh.

747
01:38:47,410 --> 01:38:51,530
I seriously haven't heard that song in like a decade for real.

748
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:53,450
Wow.

749
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:55,270
I can't believe I remember so much of it.

750
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:56,930
Wait, that kind of makes me want to sing something else.

751
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,990
Hold on.

752
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,590
Oh, gosh.

753
01:38:58,770 --> 01:38:59,190
What's it called?

754
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:02,530
I wonder.

755
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:03,950
I wonder.

756
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:06,450
Wait.

757
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:11,470
Oh, my gosh.

758
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:13,990
Stop reading my mind.

759
01:39:14,590 --> 01:39:18,150
Minto and density.exe bringing back the 2020 10 Nico Nigo Aki Bake.

Touching hands.

01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:43,620

Christmas songs.

794
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:51,720
We'll save that for Christmas.

795
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:54,480
I avoid the ima sukai.

796
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:59,360
I feel like I've sung that one quite a bit recently too.

797
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:01,520
Oh.

798
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,220
Okay, I'm gonna sing Lion.

799
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:08,200
I'm gonna try and remember.

800
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:10,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

801
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:14,140
Oh, boom, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

802
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:16,220
Wait, did I sing this one recently then?

803
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,960
Why is it showing that I've sung it?

804
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:23,460
I want to sing one that I don't sing often.

805
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:26,900
Oh, what?

806
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:27,700
Oh, my gosh.

807
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,580
This is one like that you don't hear very often.

808
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,960
Hopefully this is an actual instrumental.

809
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:41,980
it says it is.

810
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:56,120
I don't know what it says it is.

811
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:58,040
.

812
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:03,080
Am I, am I, am I, is my key off?

813
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:33,080
Oh my god, the lyrics they give you were bad.

814
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:37,620
Oh my god, the lyrics they give you were bad.

815
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:25,520
They're slow!

816
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,220
Why the hell did I choose a song?

817
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:33,940
It's been so long, I can't even remember it.

818
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:35,920
Sorry.

819
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:39,420
I used to listen to this one a lot, so I thought that I remember it, but I don't know.

820
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,320
And

821
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,900
it all come back to me.

822
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:46,720
Hit me.

823
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:48,640
But it didn't.

824
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:49,400
Sorry.

825
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:52,340
Is this the same person?

826
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:53,100
It is.

827
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:55,360
But they're the only ones uploading these instrumentals.

828
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,260
Okay, hopefully this one's better.

829
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:31,980
This is so crazy.

830
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:54,180
Oh my god, I gotta look up, hold on, I gotta look up the lyrics.

831
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:57,360
Oh my gosh, they're so slow, I can't follow.

832
01:48:58,520 --> 01:48:58,900
Triangular.

833
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:03,500
They're so, they're so slow to come up on the screen.

834
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,740
I'll start it over, sorry.

835
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:09,600
Oh my god, it's impossible to follow.

836
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:11,200
Okay.

837
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:12,800
There we go.

838
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:16,950
Sorry.

839
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:17,950
Sorry about that.

840
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:19,710
I was trying.

841
01:49:21,470 --> 01:49:22,710
Fix your thing.

842
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:24,750
Actually, wait.

843
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:29,110
Let me see if there's, like, a better quality version if I'm not even going to follow the...

844
01:49:29,110 --> 01:49:29,590
Wait, try.

845
01:49:31,550 --> 01:49:32,330

847
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:37,070

Wait, is this right?

853
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:49,070
Hold on.

And it was just like, hello.

943

02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:34,880
Would you like to be a guest speaker for my e-sports, for our e-sports class?

945
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:42,320

02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,720
But they were like, it's kind of an urgent matter.

947
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:49,960
But they didn't tell me when.

948
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:54,620
Of course I'm going to accept.

949
02:00:54,820 --> 02:00:57,720
And then they were like, here's the address to the school.

950
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:03,880

951
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:16,480

I don't know, let's see

955
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:49,970
Oh, I'm not an esports student.

956
02:01:50,290 --> 02:01:52,310
I've never done esports, that's a lie.

957
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:53,450
I've done esports once.

958
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:56,910
I've barely, I've done like one tournament before.

959
02:01:59,010 --> 02:02:02,890
I'm not, I don't know why I'm being invited to the esports class.

960
02:02:03,190 --> 02:02:06,650
I didn't even know, high schools had an esports class.

961
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:09,870
I'm excited to hear what you have to say about esports.

962
02:02:10,510 --> 02:02:13,790
They're probably gonna be like, how did you become a streamer?

963
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:15,690
And I'm gonna be like, luck baby.

964

Work hard.

967
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:24,110
Work hard.

968
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:25,810

972
02:02:34,990 --> 02:02:36,210
I could try it.

973
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:38,890
I could try it.

974
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:39,510
Why not?

975
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:42,350
I like singing new stuff.

976
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:44,650
I don't want to always sing the same songs that I do, you know?

977
02:02:46,390 --> 02:02:47,130
Ain't It...

978
02:02:47,250 --> 02:02:47,990

Let you down easy, but just give me time.

982
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:11,800

02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:14,500
Oh, am I singing this right?

984

zero the hero i don't know if i've ever done that one before He was a zero, zero, zero.

1039
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:24,250
Now he's a hero.

1040
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:26,530
Okay, I might mess this up.

1041
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:27,570
Let's try it.

1042
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:35,460
Bless my soul.

1043
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:36,860
Herc was on a roll.

1044
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:39,900
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll.

1045
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:41,220
What a pro.

1046
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:42,760
Herc could stop a show.

1047
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:45,400
Point him at a monster and you're talking SRO.

1048
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:47,180
Here was a no one.

1049
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:48,560
A zero, zero.

1050
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:50,020
Now he's a honcho.

1051
02:12:50,400 --> 02:12:51,420
He's a hero.

1052
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:54,280
Here was a kid with his act down pat.

1053
02:12:54,380 --> 02:13:00,580
From zero to hero, in no time flat, Zero to hero, just like that.

1054
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:05,380
When you smile, the girls went wild with ooze and eyes.

1055
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:11,620
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every of us.

1056
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:17,240
For appearance fees and royalties, our herd had cash to burn.

1057
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:23,460
From no guru rich or famous, he could tell you what the Grecians are.

1058
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:26,500
Amen, there he goes again.

1059
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:29,440
Sorry, I don't defeat it at an awesome 10 for 10.

1060
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:32,400
Folks lined up just to watch it flex.

1061
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:35,240
This perfect package with a pair of pretty pecs.

1062
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,340
Herky he comes, he sees he conquers.

1063
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:41,400
Honey the crowns were going balkers.

1064
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:42,960
I don't know this part at all.

1065
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,920
Zero to hero, a major hunt.

1066
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:49,900
Zero to hero, and who to thug?

1067
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:54,360

Hercules, Hercules, Hercules.

1072
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:13,520

1118
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:16,120
So, yeah.

1119
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:20,960
I'm very excited, obviously, about everything.

1120
02:18:22,500 --> 02:18:30,680
I, you know, I didn't expect some people's reactions to it.

1121
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:56,640
was really happy you know that so many people were um were really excited for us but i think you know there are some people that are kind of nervous because of um because of uh you know we've had a couple setbacks i've had a couple setbacks in the past um but i want to kind of

1122
02:19:00,880 --> 02:20:30,280
a lot of planning went into this um and i if if we weren't so sure about it like we wouldn't have gone through with it and um you know i had i i was on i remember being in my hotel room and i i was like seeing people's responses i was like whoa and it makes sense because to us we understand what's going on and to you guys you're probably just like what is this what is happening what is going on um so uh it probably seems like a little more obviously it's official but like a little more how to say like because we're not corporate so it probably see it might seem that way but you know we still all own our ips and everything um we uh we're very much still you know even i think you know you know like if even if setzuna were to pull out we would still be den setzu if we wanted to be so yeah like i know that some people are quite weary about corporal corporations and everything right now um but but well like i said we were we um satsuna has been really great with us and uh so far and um

1123
02:20:30,280 --> 02:21:47,280
things won't change for my content at all um except just adding more stuff for you guys so uh so yeah i just wanted to like i i was like having an anxiety attack at the hotel room i was like because i don't know i just didn't expect to us you know obviously we know what's going on and then so i was like oh my gosh i didn't expect people's reactions and i was like wow wow it just it threw me through a loop but um yeah so uh we're we're very confident that you know that things will be awesome and we're excited for everything so we just want to take you guys along on the journey so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah not and you know well yeah i was gonna say something and then i lost the i had the the second part of the thought and i did not have the first part of the thought and thank you guys so much for the donos i do see them thank you thank you thank you magical circle guru guru i'm sorry i don't know

1124
02:21:54,000 --> 02:22:00,060
I guess, uh, you know, it kind of came out of nowhere and I guess it's appeared different than how it actually is.

1125
02:22:00,580 --> 02:22:13,060
So, um, you know, uh, maybe, maybe if we look like we're corporate, that means we have our stuff together because behind the scenes, we're kind of scrambling.

1126
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:23,980
It looks like we, we look so official that we look like we could be corporate, but, but behind the scenes, we're like, we're like scrambling little ants or all.

1127
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,980
over the place.

1128
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:26,700
Can't be trolled.

1129
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:27,400
Thank you so much, brother.

1130
02:22:29,900 --> 02:22:32,160
Happy to see you three get the debut as idols.

Thank you.

1138
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:49,580
Yeah, so it still feels bizarre to me, even.

1139
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:51,840
It still feels very strange.

1140
02:22:53,040 --> 02:24:16,300
A lot of this stuff a lot of the stuff was well not a lot there was a handful of things that were being prepared a long long time ago and then kind of everything got thrown into a blender and so we had to kind of to kind of throw up pick up the pieces and try to puzzle them back together and see what we can salvage and what we could still use and we oh man you know I love I'm really happy with our song so much i love um the work that anita san has done we did have another artist that i was so excited to work with um maybe hopefully we can still work with them one day it was like a dream artist of mine so i was like oh i was i was like unfortunately it didn't work out but i honestly i don't even mind because the song is just that it's just that so it's just that good i can't wait you guys to hear it oh i can't wait for you guys to hear it it's so it makes your heart go go and then and then and so it's a fun song it's so fun it's so fun this will be the first underground idol group i

I am okay.

1146
02:25:35,430 --> 02:25:38,710
I just don't know if I'll hit the note because we'll see.

1147
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:40,730
We'll see, we'll see.

1148
02:25:43,650 --> 02:25:44,430
Let's try.

1149
02:25:45,390 --> 02:25:46,810
I'm stronger now.

1150
02:25:51,990 --> 02:25:52,950
Connection lost.

1151
02:25:54,030 --> 02:25:54,450
Wait, what?

1152
02:25:54,810 --> 02:25:55,870
What do you mean by that?

1153
02:25:56,650 --> 02:25:57,410
Am I still streaming?

1154
02:25:59,330 --> 02:26:00,310
Am I still live?

1155
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:03,710
Wait, what do you mean connection lost?

1156
02:26:05,050 --> 02:26:05,990
I am?

1157
02:26:06,310 --> 02:26:08,870
Oh, maybe...

1158
02:26:09,530 --> 02:26:10,630
Hold on, let me see.

1159
02:26:11,150 --> 02:26:12,710
Let me open Carol find up again.

1160
02:26:14,590 --> 02:26:15,290
Oh, here we go.

1161
02:26:15,410 --> 02:26:16,370
Oh, it's just starting.

1162
02:26:16,530 --> 02:26:17,370
Okay, let's go!

1163
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:34,210
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone Gazing at the people down below me.

1164
02:26:35,410 --> 02:26:38,670
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone.

1165
02:26:40,750 --> 02:27:39,130
They show me All my life I memorize their faces Knowing them as they will never know me All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day Not above them But part of them And out there Living in the sun one day out there all I ask is one to hold forever how there where they all live unaware what I'd give what I dare just to live one day out there

1166
02:27:45,340 --> 02:28:41,980
Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives Through the roofs and gables I can see them Every day they shout and scold and go about their lives Needless of the gift it is to be them If I was in their skin a treasure Every instant out there Strolling by the sand Taste a morning out there Like ordinary men Who freely walk up out there Just one day and then I swear I'll be content With my share Won't present despair.

1167
02:28:42,580 --> 02:28:43,740
Hold that bent.

1168
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:45,540
I won't care.

1169
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:49,700
All has meant for us.

1170
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:54,360
Now there.

1171
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,100
I can't hit that damn note.

1172
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:03,140
I can't do it.

1173
02:29:04,540 --> 02:29:06,300
I can't hit that sticker.

1174
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:06,760
No.

1175
02:29:09,140 --> 02:29:10,580
It haunts me.

1176
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:11,980
It haunts me.

1177
02:29:16,230 --> 02:29:18,210
That stupid-ass note.

1178
02:29:19,730 --> 02:29:20,450
Thank you guys.

1179
02:29:20,590 --> 02:29:21,210
Almost there.

1180
02:29:23,310 --> 02:29:24,630
No, that's not the name of the song.

1181
02:29:24,770 --> 02:29:25,930
The song is called Out There.

1182
02:29:33,180 --> 02:29:35,220
Oh, the trauma of the song.

1183
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:36,520
Ah, we'll do it.

1184
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:36,880
We'll do it.

1185
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:38,020
I'll do it better next time.

1186
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:38,780
Whatever.

1187
02:29:42,230 --> 02:29:43,190
It's such a high note.

1188
02:29:43,370 --> 02:29:43,850
It is.

1189
02:29:43,970 --> 02:29:45,810
It's like a knot in my...

1190
02:29:45,810 --> 02:29:50,050
I could hit it if I don't use my head voice.

1191
02:29:50,550 --> 02:29:50,910
You know?

1192
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:51,790
Like I use...

1193
02:29:51,790 --> 02:29:52,790
Like the way I sing the song.

1194
02:29:54,350 --> 02:30:24,770
song like you know it's very easy if I sing with my chest chest voice but with my head voice it's like so high and then I always forget to switch so oh well whatever I give up I give up it's not like I'm gonna be it's not like I'm gonna be singing is that like it's not like I have a group to on me or anything for my voice.

1195
02:30:28,930 --> 02:30:32,150
It's not like it's not like I'm gonna be doing concerts or

1196
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:39,080
it's not like it's not like it's my job.

1197
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:44,040
Okay, wait.

1198
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:45,640
I want to do one more.

1199
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:48,100
I want to do one that I can end on that sounds good.

1200
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:49,720
What's a what?

1201
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:51,940
What's a song that I could sing?

1202
02:30:56,720 --> 02:31:09,770
What's a song I don't know how the end of my brain is.

1203
02:31:10,510 --> 02:31:11,730
My brain is braining?

1204
02:31:16,420 --> 02:31:17,740
Killy Killy Joker.

1205
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:20,020
I literally said I didn't learn it.

1206
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:21,100
Shut up.

1207
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:23,460
I'm going to put you in timeout.

1208
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:26,420
It's also mostly...

1209
02:31:27,340 --> 02:31:29,100
It's mostly cello.

1210
02:31:34,060 --> 02:31:46,240
A Love Live A Love Live song Love Live What's a Love Live song?

1211
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:50,900
I scream Scream Scream I show

1212
02:31:55,420 --> 02:32:07,280
Wait You guys I think I have to sing this song Given the Given Given our location

1213
02:32:42,130 --> 02:32:43,270
I've seen it.

1214
02:32:43,590 --> 02:32:56,320
I've been there at the time from the feeling of a loud and loud heart melody I've been able to stop it, I've been able to stop it.

1215
02:32:57,110 --> 02:32:57,790
Why?

1216
02:32:58,510 --> 02:33:00,750
I've been there for years.

1217
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:08,170
Why do I feel the sadness and the name of the song?

1218
02:33:08,170 --> 02:33:17,470
The narration Oh boy, I can't stand to wait for it.

1219
02:33:18,790 --> 02:33:20,770
It's a bit too much, but I love it and I love it.

1220
02:33:20,950 --> 02:33:26,590
In the heat of the night, I can't even think about it.

1221
02:33:26,590 --> 02:33:30,550
I'm going to be able to give it some time.

1222
02:33:31,130 --> 02:33:31,890
I'm going to start.

1223
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:46,600
There's no sound, there's no sound.

1224
02:33:46,700 --> 02:33:51,700
Climb boxes

1225
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,900
Lie high

1226
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:25,060
Where are you going

1227
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:55,320
Fly high I just

1228
02:35:12,530 --> 02:35:13,270
remember something.

1229
02:35:13,470 --> 02:35:13,910
Oh, Shook.

1230
02:35:43,530 --> 02:35:51,590
I wish I was ancient history, I'll have a great time

1231
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:19,740
Yay!

1232
02:36:20,940 --> 02:36:22,520
That reminds me that...

1233
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:26,940
I'm glad I have a manager now because I don't respond to emails sometimes.

1234
02:36:27,140 --> 02:36:27,600
I get busy.

1235
02:36:30,100 --> 02:36:30,700
Yeah.

1236
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:33,360

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1239
02:36:39,780 --> 02:36:45,740
I might have gotten an email from certain someone who likes a girl and a baby.

1240
02:36:46,100 --> 02:36:46,660
I don't know!

1241
02:36:48,180 --> 02:36:48,580
Cypher!
