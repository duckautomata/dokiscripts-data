00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,220

6
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,200
That's why.

7
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,300
For real though, congratulations.

00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you!

9
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,020
Thank you!

10
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,320
Yes, our little group, Our little group will be debuting this route.

11
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,160
Oh, I forgot to put the video.

12
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,100
I was going to have it on the...

13
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,170
On the...

14
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,300
The starting...

15
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,680
Soon!

16
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:21,920
Starting...

17
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,360
Starting Scoon!

18
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,600
Yui, yui, yui, yui, yui, yui.

19
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,400
Yui, yui, yui, yui, yui.

20
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,300
The dot EXE is important.

21
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,420
Don't forget it.

22
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:35,980
Exactly.

23
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,300
Exactly.

24
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,300
It's there too.

25
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,080
Start.

26
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,260
I was gone for a couple days, but I did stream once.

27
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,400
Oh my gosh, I said I was going to stream more than once, and I was so optimistic.

28
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,620
I keep doing this.

29
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,400
I keep doing this where I'm like, oh, I could stream.

30
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,080
I could stream.

31
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:07,340
But honestly, it was such a crazy amount of time that I was so tired.

32
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,600
I'm glad I could at least stream once, though.

33
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:40,740
oh but it's all good it's all good we were so busy i was i was 110 stream no no no my my data plan caps it's all good ambition is cute i the thing is too is like i bring my whole travel setup which is very heavy and i want to i feel like if i i i bring it to use it,

34
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,160
obviously.

35
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,680
Like, I don't bring it just to... Just to carry it.

36
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,500
Like, I want to use it.

37
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,080
And so I become very ambitious.

38
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,280
And even if I can stream once, I feel like that's worth it more than...

39
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,540
If I can, you know, if I bring it and stream once, it's more worth it than... than not... than bringing it and not using it at all, obviously.

40
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,500
I missed you when you were gone.

41
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,280
Ah, I missed you guys, too!

42
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,500
It was my birthday a few days ago!

43
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,580
Ben!

44
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,000
As well as roughly a year since I started watching you.

45
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,880
I wanted to say thank you for being my comiosy.

46
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,300
That I look forward to the upcoming debut.

47
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,740
Thank you!

48
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,140
Happy birthday, Ben!

49
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,620
Ben Birdland.

50
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,560
Ben, what is it?

51
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,780
Ben Birdland?

52
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,620
Or Ben Birdland?

53
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,220
Ben-Beland.

54
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:30,840
Ben?

55
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,500
Blah, blah, blah.

56
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,240
Hold on, I'm kidding.

57
00:08:48,820 --> 00:09:16,460
Happy birthday Oh geez Oh geez No thank you for serving me I got FNAF 2 Popeyes combo yesterday Give me food poisoning Wait J-R Wait my tummy also hurt today But I did not have Popeyes The cake was super mid and worst of all They didn't even give me any packaging related to the movie Wait that's the worst You need to go brrrrr.

58
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,420
Did you really spend $110 in data because you missed us?

59
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,800
I said so many times that my thing caps at like $80, okay?

60
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,240
It caps at 80.

61
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,900
So, no, I didn't spend $110.

62
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,900
This is false advertising.

63
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,600
12 months with Rita!

64
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:39,680
Yes!

65
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,660
Rita!

66
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,140
Thank you.

67
00:09:48,340 --> 00:10:56,060
80 dollars a sub much better than 110 yeah it's okay it's all good it's all good and what's so silly too is the day after so basically what had happened is i tried to sign in so backing up i was at a hotel i was at a i was at a hotel and you'll have to sign in with your login to get free are we following I have an account at said hotel chain so I went to log in and when I went to log in so I could get my free Wi-Fi it said it said hey there's trouble logging in right now we can't log you in but now that I think about it I think the hotel had Wi-Fi that you could pay for was like ten dollars wait a second wait

68
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:26,010
a second but though but it probably would have been so bad it probably would have been unstreamable she bit on my rate to like up here's another gig question mark.

69
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,930
Oh, thank you.

70
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,690
Wait, oh gosh.

71
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,410
It probably would have been really bad.

72
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,650
It probably would have been so bad.

73
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,730
Like, the quality.

74
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,050
For the why, my God, sir, no!

75
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,430
I don't bring it up so that you guys will donate, though, please.

76
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,090
Thank you for that, Christopher.

77
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:46,750
Thank you.

78
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,330
Oh, thank you so much.

79
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,630
Hindsight is 2020, and at a significant discount.

80
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,870
It was...

81
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:03,890
Well, I wanted you guys to have the best quality of just my voice, no video.

82
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,390
Wait, there was kind of video.

83
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,810
I had the video playing in the background.

84
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,880
Do you guys hear that popping?

85
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,400
Or is it my headphones?

86
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,700
I mean, that was my birthday last weekend, get a happy birthday from my Kamiyoshi.

87
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,420
That's good!

88
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,680
Wait, you do hear it?

89
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,640
What is that?

90
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,130
Weird.

91
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:37,770
Haunted.

92
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,050
It was like It was ASMR.

93
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,670
You don't hear it anymore though, right?

94
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,410
I don't either.

95
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,990
Is it...

96
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,550
It's .exe because you guys are evil!

97
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,090
Like Sonic...

98
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,170
Every .exe is evil.

99
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:00,710
So true.

100
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,810
Me, brain smooth and tired today.

101
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,270
Make you make brain good and full of energy.

102
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,370
Brain go, yippee!

103
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,790
Also, milk.

104
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,150
Thank you for the...

105
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,030
Super chat.

106
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,050
07, 07.

107
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,710
Yeah, don't hear it anymore.

108
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,250
Strange.

109
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,810
I think it's because maybe I was clicked out of the game.

110
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,210
MVP drowned.

111
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,890
Haunted is on brand.

112
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,350
True.

113
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,090
Now, Miasa would like to buy one megabyte per...

00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,620
Charger exploding is on bread.

119
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,920
I know.

120
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,700
I know.

121
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,840
So I think I'll give up.

122
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,220
How sad.

123
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,140
I'm so sad.

124
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,120
I mean...

125
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,720
Where else?

126
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,460
Now, I hope they realize that there's a market for very cute chargers.

127
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,420
All right, Anchor.

128
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,060
Get on it, please.

129
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,100
Put gummy bears on your...

130
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,700
chargers.

131
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,280
I need it right now.

132
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,420
I'll buy five.

133
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,280
I'll do it.

134
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,400
Thank you guys for all the super chats.

135
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,760
Thank you so much.

136
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,960
How... Minky now has pay per stream?

137
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,640
No!

138
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,620
Oh no, all dot EXEs are evil.

139
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,680
Better delete them from the computer right now!

140
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,300
No, do not do this.

141
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,360
Yeah, do not do that.

142
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,620
Looking forward to MVP debuts?

143
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,480
Thank you!

144
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,760
Can't wait to see you all shining bright.

145
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,940
making your dreams of reality.

146
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,800
Also, I miss you, Vito.

147
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,160
Thank you, Phil!

148
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,920
Thank you so much.

149
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:35,920
Thank you.

150
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,880
I tried Albany's gummies before.

151
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,540
Not Albany.

152
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,840
Is this a D's joke?

153
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,180
I hope you're having a great day, Vito.

154
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,880
You too!

155
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,740
Almost got the one-year badge.

156
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,100
Got a new job today, Paul!

157
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,600
Thank you!

158
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,760
Oh, congratulations.

159
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,900
Pretty good day so far.

160
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,600
Have a good stream.

161
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,940
Have a good day.

162
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,840
Have a better day.

163
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,680
Have the bestest day.

164
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,140
Keep having a good day.

165
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,520
Keep going.

166
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,380
Wait, oh my gosh.

167
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,020
I'm trying to read the super chats that I missed earlier.

168
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,140
But the YouTube sucks!

169
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,700
Sorry.

170
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,200
Okay, I think I got it.

171
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,460
We just turned the game music all the way up.

172
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,960
It's like pretty high right now.

173
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,620
I think it'll, uh, I think right now it's just the ambience, but it should, it should be up.

174
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,520
How was they cancel my gummy bear charger?

175
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,040
They said it would explode the most mint-fantile thing ever.

176
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,180
Can you ever, wait, have you ever seen the U-green?

177
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,080
Uno.

178
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,480
It's kind of cute.

179
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,300
I haven't.

180
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,680
Is that a charger?

181
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,560
Is it okay if I name my new kitty after you?

182
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,720
Of course!

183
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,820
But is it going to be me kitty?

184
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,110
Hmm.

185
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,870
Yul Green approve.

186
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,110
I usually get Anchor stuff.

187
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,350
Not the card game.

188
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,610
Hold on.

189
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,110
I'm going to look it up like right now.

190
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,250
Yul.

191
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,490
Yul Green Uno.

192
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,030
I've never heard of this brand before.

193
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,470
Wait, that's kind of cute.

194
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,570
That is cute.

195
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,110
It's like a little robot guy.

196
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,430
He's smiling even.

197
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,390
Wait, this is so cute.

198
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,430
He's kind of like...

199
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,890
That's what he's like.

200
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,290
Anchor is pretty solid for all cords and power banks.

201
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,410
I, yeah, I feel like they've got a good thing going.

202
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,890
But I'll look into this U-Green.

203
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,050
Thank you for the suggestion.

204
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,910
That's cute.

205
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,310
They're so fast.

206
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:36,930
Wow!

207
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,190
Ghost cutie.

208
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,990
Wait, that's 15 months is more than a year.

209
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,510
Thank you though.

210
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,530
Yesterday was my birthday.

211
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,570
Gonna get a super minky birthday song even though it was a day late.

212
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,290
Goopy!

213
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,470
Happy birthday!

214
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,800
Happy birthday.

215
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,680
So many birthdays I missed.

216
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

217
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

218
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,020
I feel this next...

219
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,220
So I know I was gone for a couple days.

220
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,760
And then Sunday, I'm also starting gone.

221
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,740
So I'm for until December.

222
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,200
I feel like I'm missing so much for like two weeks even.

223
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,480
I feel though this trip, my upcoming trip is pretty busy.

224
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,240
It was a vacation, a short vacation.

225
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,400
And then it suddenly was just like, oh, you're in Japan.

226
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,820
Do you want to do this work?

227
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,580
And I'm like, I can't say no.

228
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,520
And then they're like, do you want to do this work?

229
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,540
And I'm like, I can't say no.

230
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,200
So I apologize in advance.

231
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,240
I got extended because I can't say no.

232
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,020
But it's other things that I want to do.

233
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,220
One of them's really cool.

234
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,440
I hope it works out.

235
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:12,300
But I feel that with this upcoming trip, because it's so busy for me, I probably will be streaming like night, Japan time, which is gonna be early morning for you guys.

236
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,160
I don't know.

237
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,320
I'm gonna try and do some streams.

238
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm gonna try and wake up early because a lot of my plans are involving me waking up early and going to do something.

239
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:33,440
And so I'm like, well, I even have time to stream in the morning in Japan so that I can then stream at my normal time.

240
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,600
Some of us are on JST.

241
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,760
Then it'll be perfect for you.

242
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,680
Maybe.

243
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,460
Night Japan is perfect EU.

244
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,280
Sounds great.

245
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,540
Yeah, there you go.

246
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,540
So, hmm.

247
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
So, the timing might be a little varied.

248
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,560
But I'll do my best to stream.

249
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,660
Even if it's morning of EST.

250
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,660
Yes, yes.

251
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,080
Just giving you guys a heads up since my morning so far.

252
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,000
So busy, it seems.

253
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,100
right now.

254
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,360
Can't wait for Friday.

255
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:11,940
Me too.

256
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,340
Actually, I can't wait for Friday.

257
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,800
I still have so much to do.

258
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,740
Isn't it a nice surprise this game in Okami where peak video games are art games for my teenage years?

259
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,520
I played Okami, but I'm surprised and I always saw this game.

260
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,680
I don't know why I never played it.

261
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,000
I think maybe I did not have the console.

262
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,760
What was it?

263
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,660
Like PS3?

264
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,520
But I did play Olkami.

265
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,960
Yeah, I didn't have PS3.

266
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,900
I didn't get one until I was like, okay.

267
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,500
Time to stream.

268
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,380
And play Metal Gear Solid 4.

269
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,060
So, yeah, this game kind of fell off my radar.

270
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,540
And now I get to play it now.

271
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,440
And so I'm very, very excited.

272
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,100
I'm very excited.

273
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,800
Hi Mito, can you guesstimate with your XOL powers when a boat sailing from Japan?

274
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,940
47 degrees, 9.

275
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,440
Oh, what's that mean?

276
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,640
Oh, shoot, what's, uh, hope you enjoy journey.

277
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Thanks!

278
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:38,680
I saw some funny comments kind of discussing my job that I described in my last, in my previous stream, the work stream, which is funny because I did no work, but all I did was talk about my old work.

279
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,840
How funny.

280
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,640
I'll be doing so well.

281
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,860
It was my birthday this past weekend.

282
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,340
May I request the Metal Gear birthday song?

283
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,040
Ah!

284
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,660
So bad!

285
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,420
Happy birthday!

286
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,640
We'll sing this song for all the birthdays that I missed over the past couple of days.

287
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,220
Happy birthday.

288
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,180
Congratulations.

289
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,040
Happy birthday with salutations.

290
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,960
Happy birthday.

291
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:36,680
May your sky stay blue happy birthday to you happy birthday but yeah seeing people's people's reactions to that were very funny honestly I guess it yeah like there was you know I talked about it and I described it quite in a funny way.

292
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,540
It was also so long ago that I don't remember every little tiny aspect of it.

293
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,920
But then people were like commenting saying like, oh, she probably did something like this.

294
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,380
And I was like, oh yeah, I do remember doing that.

295
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,960
So it was, it was, yeah, it was a job.

296
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:29,420
And the thing too is like, we worked with some major like Japanese manufacturing companies, like the places that like build the big, the big like um hold on, uh, like construction um uh, construction like machinery so yeah,

297
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,940
I had to be, I had to be very accurate um Thank you, Vinto, smiling so much.

298
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,620
I hurt right now.

299
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,440
Vinto used to bint the boats.

300
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,120
I was interested to hear that in your last stream.

301
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:54,260
It was, I've, I've, as a, as someone who is dead, I have, uh, the phrase lived many lives.

302
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,660
It's quite accurate for me, maybe.

303
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,240
Do you know the other game?

304
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,830
What?

305
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,470
If you want to hear more about that, you can go to my previous stream.

306
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,830
We're going to play Journey!

307
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,450
Journey, journey, journey.

308
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,910
I'm very excited.

309
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:26,250
I saw that this one was pretty short, and I, unfortunately, I have meetings with the other Densitu Gurleys.

310
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:30,370
Well, not meetings, but we're meeting up basically every night this week.

311
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:38,270
So many, many things that we have to finalize and stuff.

312
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,290
Don't stop believing me, Tao!

313
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,590
Thank you!

314
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,770
So, yeah, busy, busy, busy, for sure.

315
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,690
So let's get started then.

316
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,270
Let's start.

317
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,110
Let's go on our journey!

318
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,530
Well, you end up playing with a wisp.

319
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,270
I don't know!

320
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,790
Isn't it like...

321
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,910
I don't know really anything about this game, but I think you get paired up with someone and it's random or something.

322
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,050
So excited for your idol debut.

323
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,650
Thank you!

324
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,570
Wow.

325
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,740
I'm playing PC on Steam, so.

326
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,420
Whoa.

327
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:49,880
Whoa.

328
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,930
Whoa.

329
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,250
Wow.

330
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,650
Was that me?

331
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,270
Yes.

332
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,710
I'm on controller.

333
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,750
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's telling me to look around.

334
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,090
That's me.

335
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,410
That's telling me to move.

336
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,950
Look at the sand!

337
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,230
Oh, it looks so edible.

338
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:31,870
Oh, wow.

339
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,070
Wow!

340
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,590
Oh!

341
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,730
What did I do?

342
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,150
What is that?

343
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,100
Look at me, go!

344
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,740
Go, go, go, go.

345
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,520
You are good.

346
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:55,920
What?

347
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,280
Oh, whoa.

348
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,380
Heavy.

349
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,120
Look at that.

350
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,220
So cool.

351
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,760
Everyone has always been saying how beautiful and beautiful this game looks and sounds.

352
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,860
And I can see things right now.

353
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Oh yeah he is.

354
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,060
Whoa!

355
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,220
Journey!

356
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,540
Just a small town girl.

357
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,440
Oh, we're still going.

358
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,280
What are these in the sand though?

359
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,780
They're not gravestones are they?

360
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,420
Is that gonna be me?

361
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,300
Hello?

362
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,240
Hello?

363
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,300
Hello?

364
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,460
You are called.

365
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,360
Scan my...

366
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,860
Scan for my mixtape.

367
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,220
Keyblade graveyard.

368
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,320
Oh my gosh.

369
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,960
These definitely...

370
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,470
They have like little symbols on them.

371
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,190
Are they different?

372
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,990
If they're different than their gravestones.

373
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,610
Hmm.

374
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:26,850
Hmm.

375
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,230
There's some boys up there.

376
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,810
Get those guys.

377
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:36,710
Wait.

378
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,610
Can I hop?

379
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,530
Okay, he hops all on his own.

380
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,070
Wait, is that my symbol?

381
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:45,430
No.

382
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,210
Who is it?

383
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,370
I'm calling somebody.

384
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,910
Pick up the phone.

385
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,990
What?

386
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,870
Whoa!

387
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,570
Oh, okay.

388
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:29,090
I can only do that when these guys replenish my thing.

389
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,890
Well, luckily there's many of them!

390
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,250
Oh, nice.

391
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,090
Nice roll.

392
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,250
Are they...

393
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,210
the spirits of my ancestors?

394
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,310
Well, I want to go in there, but I feel like I should be following.

395
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:58,990
Because...

396
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,690
Thank you.

397
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,710
Because there's this.

398
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,070
I feel like I should be following the path a little bit.

399
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,390
Good night means out.

400
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,090
Good night!

401
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,110
This is Anakin Skywalker's least favorite game.

402
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,650
Truly.

403
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,210
Scan it to use code boomerang ever.

404
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,910
We'll try going here first.

405
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,270
How do I meet somebody?

406
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,250
Who's gonna play with me?

407
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:29,070
One lucky person who's been waiting for someone else to join.

408
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,970
Playing journey for so many years.

409
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,490
What is this?

410
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:35,870
Oh!

411
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,950
Oh!

412
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,010
Did I do

413
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,320
it?

414
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,740
Does anything in here match my thing?

415
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,560
My symbol, my QR code?

416
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,720
I don't think so.

417
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,680
See the graves?

418
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,320
It was this one that I think looked like it.

419
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,850
Ooh, the sound of the rocks is nice.

420
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,050
Okay, now they tell me to go this way.

421
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,410
Is this game pretty linear?

422
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,770
Please, magic cloth.

423
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,190
I want to fly in.

424
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,170
I wish to fly.

425
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,030
Yeah?

426
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,310
Okay.

427
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,550
More magic cloth!

428
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,990
Woohoo!

429
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,830
Um...

430
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,290
Thank you.

431
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,730
It looks so cute.

432
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,050
It does look pretty cute, though.

433
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,320
Oh.

434
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,060
I did not jump high enough.

435
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,720
Oh geez, okay.

436
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,480
That's fine.

437
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,900
What is this?

438
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,520
Somebody listen to my song!

439
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,860
Why is it glowing?

440
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,620
It's the only one, too.

441
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:17,860
Mysterious.

442
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,360
There's a glowing over there, too.

443
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,900
Whoa, whoa!

444
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,800
I need to get in there.

445
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,980
You can hold it for a bigger area?

446
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,880
Oh, thank you!

447
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,840
Open up!

448
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,080
Can you get me?

449
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:44,840
No.

450
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,580
They're trapped.

451
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,680
Oh, there's some trapped in here too!

452
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,250
Oh my gosh!

453
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:55,890
Give me more?

454
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:56,910
Please?

455
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:58,790
I'm hungry.

456
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,790
Thank you!

457
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,050
Oh, they're all trapped!

458
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,790
Interesting.

459
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,510
Happy day Saturday.

460
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,910
Happy birthday, other wasp too!

461
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:10,970
Hatata!

462
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,250
Happy birthday!

463
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,390
There's...

464
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,110
Come on up.

465
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,390
Wait.

466
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,090
Oh, shoot.

467
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,290
Oh, I'm bad at it.

468
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,050
These guys are skipped.

469
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,110
When do I meet somebody else?

470
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,280
Hello.

471
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,320
Please?

472
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,140
Please.

473
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,580
Oh.

474
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,420
Thank you.

475
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,940
Oh, up here, up here.

476
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,100
Hop, hop, hop, hop.

477
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,640
Hop, hop.

478
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,060
Did we learn a new one?

479
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,340
Whoa!

480
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,520
Okay?

481
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,440
Interesting.

482
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,560
Oh, whoa, whoa.

483
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,940
I ran out.

484
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,160
My scarf got longer.

485
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
That's what happened.

486
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,160
What's going on up here?

487
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,860
Ah!

488
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:27,800
Whoa!

489
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:28,860
Need!

490
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:34,680
Free!

491
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,020
Be free!

492
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,700
Yeah, give me more.

493
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:50,980
Whoa!

494
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,440
Nice.

495
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,060
But there was one.

496
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,400
That one.

497
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
I want that one as well.

498
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,240
Before we do that, we can always, we can always.

499
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,370
Stick the landing.

500
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,310
Yes, longer.

501
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,990
Longer, longer.

502
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,350
Okay.

503
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,730
It still dies so fast though.

504
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,780
You're a landing.

505
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,920
You're a landing.

506
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,900
Yes, they all want to touch my scarf.

507
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,160
So if I do this...

508
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,540
So awesome.

509
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,460
So what's this going on up here?

510
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,180
Oh, oh wait, uh, one more?

511
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,720
One more?

512
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,040
It's so satisfying.

513
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,680
Oh, did we just sit down?

514
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,680
Like a little cat.

515
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,840
Our character does kind of look like a cat, no?

516
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:16,930
Hello?

517
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,480
It's a light volcano.

518
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,080
Oh.

519
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,720
character is so cute

520
00:36:40,060 --> 00:37:01,330
the birds make the crops grow it's their poop and that makes the people grow and then the people get cats they build bigger trees so

521
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:17,360
we must restore the birds so that we can bring back the plants and the people.

522
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,760
That's what we must do.

523
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,240
So smart.

524
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,260
I know.

525
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,340
Do you guys see that?

526
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,680
There's my partner.

527
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,520
Who are you?

528
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,660
Who are you?

529
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,880
Who are you?

530
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,060
They're running away.

531
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,360
She is an archaeologist.

532
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,900
I'm a geologist.

533
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,340
Player two?

534
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,080
I'm guessing I couldn't open the other stuff in there because I just left.

535
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Hopefully.

536
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,300
Can you make a funny face?

537
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,780
Like the hat or like really funny?

538
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,580
Like this.

539
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,700
Player two.

540
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,230
Where are you?

541
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,160
The sounds in this game are just so long.

542
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:26,740

I know you guys say loud, we'll say louder or something, but...

581
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,190
Good morning!

00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,850
Me too, me too!

00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:18,890
Nice.

584
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,650
Wait, there's still sparkle.

585
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,090
What's the sparkle for?

586
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,790
Hmm.

587
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,550
Mysterious.

588
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,890
Wait, so if I...

589
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:34,950
Whoa!

590
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,250
Cool!

591
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,360
Maybe just to let you know it was there.

592
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,120
Ayya!

593
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,470
Whoa,

594
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:03,820
whoa, whoa!

595
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,260
Nice!

596
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,800
Yeah, I was gonna say this will make a big guy.

597
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,000
Supposed to get the little pieces, too.

598
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:16,960
Little pieces?

599
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,980
The thing, the glowy bits?

600
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,400
I feel like you have to, so you can extend your...

601
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,400
Oh!

602
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,760
So you can extend your scarf.

603
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,540
Oh, I think that...

604
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,200
Did it, no?

605
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,260
But there's still more to see.

606
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,660
We're not leaving yet.

607
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,040
I'm the leader of this coup.

608
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,420
Not yet.

609
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,180
We must get more birds.

610
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,300
Pronto.

611
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,580
Eyeball.

612
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,100
The journey for the longer scarf.

613
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,860
The longest scarf.

614
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,400
The top chicken.

615
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,700
Yeah, we're birds and we're birding it up.

616
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:08,880
Oh.

617
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,120
Get up there.

618
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,820
Get up there.

619
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,620
Wait, there we go.

620
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,140
Wait, there's something behind there.

621
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:20,800
Aibo!

622
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,100
Aibo, look!

623
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:24,480
Oh!

624
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,040
Aibo, Aibo!

625
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,750
It's lore!

626
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,490
It's lore, look!

627
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,890
What is that?

628
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,660
Cities, they had cities.

629
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,560
cities even.

630
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,620
They were an advanced society.

631
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,260
Can you fill me up?

632
00:45:59,360 --> 00:45:59,740
Thank you.

633
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,040
There's... Oh, that one didn't open anything.

634
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,500
That, I can see it's open.

635
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,460
We have to get up there.

636
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:15,780
I think the best way to get that maybe from here we'll make it.

637
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,580
Or if we go from the top.

638
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,140
I think from we can make it, though.

639
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:28,730
Oh, my God.

640
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,110
Ah, nice.

641
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:31,990
She's too good.

642
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:33,810
Use the boards.

643
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:34,570
Oh, I forgot.

644
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:35,950
It's fine.

645
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:36,530
We didn't need them.

646
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,250
Settling in with some homemade curry.

647
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:38,970
Ah, Chucky!

648
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,310
Miss Consanity.

649
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,670
Thank you.

650
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,850
If I died and came back as a flying dish towel in the desert, I'd be pretty mad.

651
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:48,550
Why?

652
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:54,370
I think it'd be quite relaxing.

653
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:55,890
No?

654
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:57,650
Just me?

655
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:06,690
Listen to the song of my people!

656
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,070
Hey!

657
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,110
Top me off!

658
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,510
Thank you.

659
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,170
Wait, they did not top me off!

660
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,250
Chatty over here.

661
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,030
Here we go!

662
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,150
Do we get everything in here, you think?

663
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:55,010
I don't think I see anything else.

664
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:58,950
Yeah, I did?

665
00:47:59,310 --> 00:47:59,770
Okay, glue.

666
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,940
Should be.

667
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,380
Cool.

668
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,300
Okay, I get this side.

669
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:10,820
Eyeball.

670
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,080
Good job!

671
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:26,860
Um...

672
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:27,220
Oh.

673
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,660
We have to sit.

674
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,520
Oh my gosh, they really look like cats.

675
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,100
Yes?

676
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,140
The great cat.

677
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:39,780
Oh my god.

678
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,620
Wait, it's kind of freaky.

679
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,800
That looks like a bird.

680
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:44,800
That's a bird.

681
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:56,650
War.

682
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,210
Then they got cats.

683
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,250
They built big towns.

684
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,590
Wait, that looks like the thing we just kind of made, right?

685
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,160
And trains!

686
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,580
They were so advanced!

687
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,220
It's a big bird!

688
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,980
And electricity!

689
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,520
Is it because of the scarves?

690
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,380
The little birds?

691
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,360
The little birds?

692
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,220
The fabric birds?

693
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,380
They use the cloth for power!

694
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,940
Glad you're home and happy exploring, Possum!

695
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,000
Thank you!

696
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,540
Hope to be back for the end.

697
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,300
Thank you!

698
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,220
It's my birthday today!

699
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,320
Oh my gosh, King of Tendies!

700
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,360
Happy birthday!

701
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,320
It's round of love for Mickey and Whisper that I've been here.

702
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,420
While I've been here.

703
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,320
Happy birthday!

704
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,000
Wow.

705
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,960
There's something...

706
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,340
There's like a shooting star above the...

707
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,500
Above the...

708
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,140
The volcano.

709
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,120
It's pink!

710
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,920
I'll release you.

711
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,900
I'll release you.

712
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:57,460
What's that sound, though?

713
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,430
Whoa!

714
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,330
Different type of bird!

715
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,590
Oh my gosh!

716
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,720
No item name, thank you so much!

717
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,580
That's why I got to thank you!

718
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,180
I was like looking at your name like How do I say this?

719
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,740
How do I say this?

720
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,800
What's over here?

721
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,260
He's calling too.

722
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,200
He wants us to follow.

723
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:44,750
Oh.

724
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,010
Thank you!

725
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,630
They're so nice!

726
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:52,350
Oh, goodbye.

727
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,550
Where are

728
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,030
we going?

729
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,330
We're just following him.

730
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,810
Am I playing with a viewer or Rando?

731
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,870
We think it's a viewer, no?

732
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,310
Do a little chirp if you're a viewer.

733
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,490
I feel like that was too early.

734
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:19,350
See?

735
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,530
Oh, he wants his friend!

736
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:23,570
Release the friend.

737
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:31,690
I don't think randomly people are playing this game in 2025.

738
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,910
I think that's the same.

739
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:36,870
Wow!

740
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:46,870
I have my own magic card.

741
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:47,810
Oh, oops, sorry.

742
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,710
Wait, can I get back on?

743
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,670
Wait, oh, don't move.

744
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:50,290
Don't move.

745
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,030
Wait, don't move.

746
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,950
Wait, oh shoot.

747
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,970
Can somebody grab me?

748
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:57,290
Wait.

749
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,910
Can somebody pick me up?

750
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:01,570
Please.

751
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:02,850
Can you pick me up?

752
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:04,810
Can you pick me up?

753
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:05,230
No?

754
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:08,890
No!

755
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,330
I thought I could move!

756
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:15,650
My magic carpet.

757
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,030
What's in here?

758
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:25,810
Cats.

759
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:34,570
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

760
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,650
The cats and the birds.

761
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:40,410
Will you pick me up?

762
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:41,510
Pick me up?

763
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:42,570
Pick me up.

764
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:44,610
Pick me up.

765
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:45,890
No, I know you wanted to.

766
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:46,470
I know.

767
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:47,690
I know you wanted to.

768
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,790
You were so close.

769
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:49,510
You were glowing!

770
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,570
I heard you needed to be lit.

771
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:00,210
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

772
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:06,470
Yeah, oh, we're going this way?

773
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,270
Okay, no biggie.

774
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:14,730
Pick me up!

775
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,090
Pick me up!

776
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,570
Pick me up, please!

777
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,850
Come on, come on!

778
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,410
We're both struggling, me and my partner.

779
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,420
It's a sound, it's so loud.

780
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,640
Come on!

781
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

782
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,910
Come here, hold on, birds.

783
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,150
Hold on.

784
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:55,310
Yes.

785
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,010
Oh, I think I got it.

786
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:03,210
What do you do when Minto leaves?

787
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,550
Wait for her to get back.

788
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:06,230
I'm back!

789
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,350
I'm back for a few days.

790
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:14,650
Minto flying around.

791
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,270
like a grain of sand.

792
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,070
Please pick- please upies!

793
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,070
Please upies, please!

794
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:28,670
I guess we can constantly be jumping though because they'll give us constant like...

795
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,670
They'll constantly be refreshing our...

796
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,870
Where are they going?

797
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:37,450
Our scarf.

798
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:38,510
Oh, this way.

799
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,080
No, no ABJ.

800
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,860
Unless it's A, B, J.

801
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,360
No, sorry, wait.

802
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,180
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

803
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:54,600
We're lagging.

804
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:55,860
Whoa, we're lagging.

805
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,260
A.

806
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,060
A.

807
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,280
A, B.

808
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,620
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

809
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:07,640
J.

810
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,600
You get it?

811
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,020
What are we talking about?

812
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:22,720
Always.

813
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,880
Always be jumping.

814
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,460
Always be jumping.

815
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,300
It can be abbreviated.

816
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,060
You just have to be careful about it, you know?

817
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,220
What are you doing?

818
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,060
I hear noise, but I don't know where it's from.

819
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:41,880
Where's my partner?

820
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,060
Friend?

821
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,460
Oh, oh, they want this guy out.

822
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:46,800
I see.

823
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,380
I see, I see.

824
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,540
Don't worry, I got him.

825
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,600
Oh, you got him.

826
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,700
You got him.

827
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:01,990
Good job.

828
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,810
Good job.

829
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:07,530
What do they want now?

830
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:08,730
Oh, wait.

831
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:09,330
Can we go inside?

832
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,870
No.

833
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:16,290
Where do they go?

834
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,230
What do they want now?

835
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,140
This away.

836
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,280
Time to leave.

837
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,720
Always be journeying.

838
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:27,860
Yeah.

839
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:34,750
Oh, my gosh.

840
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:35,910
I'm flying so much.

841
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:38,870
Give me!

842
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:40,790
Or don't.

843
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:41,870
Okay, thank you.

844
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:53,490
I wish you could jump, jump though.

845
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:58,230
You can't jump if you have no...

846
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:58,590
You know?

847
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:02,830
We'll let them free!

848
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:03,890
We'll let them free!

849
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:08,850
Oh, there's a thing, I see it!

850
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,030
I see it, I see it, thank you.

851
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:13,170
Good job.

852
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,410
They build mechs!

853
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:18,730
Wow.

854
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,800
They build mechs too.

855
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:31,750
Metal gear?

856
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:39,330
Where are we going?

857
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:40,930
Gosh, this game is so pretty.

858
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,770
This is where we came from, no?

859
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,050
Cloth gear.

860
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,170
Look how shiny the sand is.

861
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,550

862
00:59:05,330 --> 01:00:04,890

01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:07,690
They were like automatically put at medium.

864
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:10,910
But now I'm nervous.

865
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,490
Could be the network.

866
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:18,370
That's what I'm thinking.

867
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,250
It's like that kind of lag, you know.

868
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:22,250
Did they go up?

869
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,050
Where are they going?

870
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,570
Seems to be the case.

871
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,330
Around here?

872
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:36,130
Or something?

873
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:41,730
Can I...

874
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:42,130
Oh gosh.

875
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:42,570
I'm stuck.

876
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:44,290
Um, thank you.

877
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:45,290
Thank you.

878
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,390
Oh, something's...

879
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:53,370
Oh, he's got me.

880
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:55,650
Thank you!

881
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:04,160
Oh, wait, is that a bad guy or...

882
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,160
Oh, it's like a machine.

883
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:08,620
Whoa!

884
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,900
A little bit spoopy now.

885
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:12,980
You okay?

886
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:13,580
Don't fall!

887
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,860
Whoa, it's making me.

888
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,830
Oh, it's freaky.

889
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:25,250
Whoa.

890
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:27,590
There's so many trapped in there.

891
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,210
We'll set you free.

892
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:33,510
Right over here.

893
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,210
Are you going to help us up?

894
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:37,770
Help me up.

895
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,850
Help me up.

896
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:41,950
Thank you.

897
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,670
Let's go, Aibo.

898
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:52,290
Did

899
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,600
that do it?

900
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,460
Did we get it?

901
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:03,660
Yeah.

902
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:05,640
My wife missed you.

903
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,340
We're both very excited about density.exe.

904
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,540
Also, the Minto Pansu didn't fit one of...

905
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,380
I say yeah.

906
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,640
Scarfens.

907
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,360
They're scarfing it down.

908
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:28,800
Yeah,

909
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,500
we want to do lots of covers together.

910
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,630
Oh, more.

911
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,270
Bigger cities.

912
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,690
More, taller.

913
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,510
Wait, are these all like power?

914
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:51,670
Basically, they're not houses.

915
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:53,450
They're like energy.

916
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:56,190
They're energy centers, kind of.

917
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:57,610
Wow.

918
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:58,650
Or maybe?

919
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,780
Be free!

920
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,760
They do kind of remind me of like, yeah, like dolphins or whales or something.

921
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,040
Power plants!

922
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,600
Yeah, that's the word that I was thinking of.

923
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,320
They're waiting for us, eyeball.

924
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,660
There's two that are waiting for us.

925
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:31,460
Whoa.

926
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:37,980
Wow!

927
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:44,780
Pink.

928
01:03:56,410 --> 01:04:00,530
I'm I'm zooming watch this sick flip

929
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:15,370
Wow, oh dang it I dropped to Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait yes

Wow!

932
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,230
I'll land right!

933
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,680
Did something.

934
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,580
Oh, released more.

935
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,500
Good job!

936
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:09,080
Good job!

937
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,190
What else we got going on?

938
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,180
Is this a thing?

939
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,400
This looks like a thing.

940
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,080
A little...

941
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:27,520
...

942
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:34,610
Good job!

943
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:36,290
Good job, Aibo!

944
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:39,990
Wait, there's like some guys over here.

945
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,510
You could see me in the corner leaving this cousin?

946
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:52,270
Yay!

947
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,260
Okay, hold on.

948
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,400
There were guys over here.

949
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:06,900
Now that I know that there's sometimes like secrets, it makes me wonder, you know?

950
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,400
What could be up here?

951
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:12,940
Aha!

952
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:17,890
And the search.

953
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:22,890
More lore!

954
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:30,130
Hey, Eyeball.

955
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:34,110
They're just more cats in cities.

956
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,550
Cats in boxes.

957
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:40,210
So now we got...

958
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:42,630
Do you see that up there, Eyeball?

959
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:45,070
Eyeball, there's another thing.

960
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,790
You said, yes, I do.

961
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:51,970
I do see it.

962
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,130
Great dominto, sama.

963
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,770
I'm having cheesecake for Thanksgiving.

964
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:56,850
Can't decide what flavor.

965
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:57,350
Oreo?

966
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:58,070
Oreo.

967
01:06:58,550 --> 01:06:58,830
Oreo.

968
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,990
Wait, how do we get up there?

969
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:03,330
Here?

970
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:04,650
Right here.

971
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:06,550
Okay.

972
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:07,930
I'm watching you.

973
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,630
Ah, go get it!

974
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:13,750
Go get your dreams!

975
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:14,170
up!

976
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,740
Wait, am I gonna make it?

977
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,300
Wait, eyeball.

978
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,220
Eye boy, I don't know if I'm gonna make it.

979
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:28,760
Eye boy!

980
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:29,780
I made it.

981
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,460
Just kidding.

982
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,280
I made it!

983
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,400
I'm guessing that probably was...

984
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,660
Oh my gosh, it's so smoky.

985
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:43,400
That probably was like the only secret in this area.

986
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,660
We got everything else, I think.

987
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,880
So we can continue onwards.

988
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:47,240
You ready?

989
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,120
Oh, I flew hard.

990
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,580
I flew like, eyeball, eyeball, I kept, I couldn't stop.

991
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,220
Oh my gosh, we're still going.

992
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,340
Let's go.

993
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,940
You think you'd want an actual churro?

994
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,960
If I, actually, like, cinnamon cheesecake sounds pretty good.

995
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:27,700
I'm not gonna lie.

996
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:33,060
I don't know, but I'm such an Oreo fan of anything.

997
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,400
Oreo drink.

998
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:35,820
Yeah.

999
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,180
I don't want to miss the secrets.

1000
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,080
Whoa, whoa.

1001
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:43,900
Oh, okay.

1002
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,260
Down here?

1003
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,220
Oh, shoot.

1004
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:55,410
Wee!

1005
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,290
I already missed a secret.

1006
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:57,970
Oh, well.

1007
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:00,150
It's my first time playing.

1008
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,470
I'm gonna miss secrets.

1009
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:08,670
You missed it, but it's okay.

1010
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:09,330
My bad.

1011
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:10,190
I tried.

1012
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:11,710
I tried looking.

1013
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:17,680
Oh, my God.

1014
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:18,700
It's so orange.

1015
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:19,080
Oh, my God.

1016
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,380
reminds me of a tangerine drink.

1017
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,180
Wow!

1018
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,260
Oh my gosh, cinema.

1019
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,140
Wow!

1020
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:27,960
Whoa!

1021
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,900
Oh, I almost ran into the wall.

1022
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:33,300
Oh!

1023
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,720
It's so pretty.

1024
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:48,900
I'm going.

1025
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:53,860
We're still going?

1026
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,960
I can't see anything.

1027
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:56,740
It's so orange.

1028
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,020
Oops, I'm orange.

1029
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:09,160
Up there maybe is something if I can even I don't even know if I could reach that maybe from like over here.

1030
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,940
I don't think so.

1031
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:13,440
They forced me back.

1032
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,120
Who's calling?

1033
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:20,940
Whoa.

1034
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:32,350
We have Breaking Bad up in here.

1035
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:42,630
Okay I know the sand looks so soft but I'm sure this is hard.

1036
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:44,190
Are you okay?

1037
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,620
Okay, good.

1038
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,080
Before we do that, there's some stuff I want to explore.

1039
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,100
Like, what's this over here?

1040
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:01,340
Anything?

1041
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,260
It might be nothing.

1042
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,780
It could be something.

1043
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,040
It is something!

1044
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,560
Good job, team.

1045
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,850
I got a spam call when you said that.

1046
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:17,950
What is going on there?

1047
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:21,150
Do you get it, I boy?

1048
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,100
Whoa, mouth!

1049
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,520
I'll follow you.

1050
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,080
Is there anything over there?

1051
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,520
I don't know if there is anything here.

1052
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:46,860
No.

1053
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:52,600
The people divided the cities, maybe.

1054
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:02,530
To imagine all of this was such lush green, you know?

1055
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:04,710
Alright, ready, eyeball!

1056
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:07,770
Good job.

1057
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,310
Yeah, good job, good job.

1058
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,250
It was basically timed perfectly.

1059
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,650
What happened to them?

1060
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:17,490
I don't know.

1061
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:20,230
It's part of the journey to find out.

1062
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,130
Look how long my scarf is now.

1063
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,090
Basically a cape.

1064
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:38,600
Oh no!

1065
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,100
The power, the electricity!

1066
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,300
Severe.

1067
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,300
The machinery!

1068
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,360
What happened to it?

1069
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,120
Uh-oh.

1070
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,160
Wait, that doesn't...

1071
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,440
Wait, this seems really bad.

1072
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,140
Wait.

1073
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,960
This does not seem good.

1074
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,140
War.

1075
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,680
They fought over it.

1076
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:16,120
No!

1077
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,290
Let's go, Aibo.

1078
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,600
Into the abyss.

1079
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,080
I want to hear Mint say the phrase.

1080
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:43,720
War.

1081
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,820
War has changed.

1082
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:48,920
That?

1083
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,500
Wow.

1084
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,020
The sand is so shiny.

1085
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,620
Look at the kick up more sand.

1086
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:07,480
New day.

1087
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:08,620
Kick it up.

1088
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,440
Kick up...

1089
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,040
Kick up the sand.

1090
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:19,660
Yeah!

1091
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,540
Kick up that sand.

1092
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:26,600
Porker is cooking now to watch OSI.

1093
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,160
Yummy!

1094
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,860
What are these?

1095
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,760
These look special.

1096
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,490
Just a rack.

1097
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:42,680
Oh, okay.

1098
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:46,740
Oh, there are some dolphins down here.

1099
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:50,640
Oh!

1100
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,980
It looks like we're at the bottom of the ocean, no?

1101
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:06,790
Whoa!

1102
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:08,910
Whoa!

1103
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:10,350
Are these the trains?

1104
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:11,830
They look like it now, right?

1105
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:13,990
Is there anything in here?

1106
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:16,130
You check out that one, I boy.

1107
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:16,910
Check out this one.

1108
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:18,490
Call if you need help.

1109
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:22,450
Oh!

1110
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:22,990
Oh!

1111
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:23,730
In here!

1112
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:24,490
In here!

1113
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,600
Get your thing.

1114
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:39,500
You're welcome.

1115
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,400
I don't know what they were saying.

1116
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,860
I don't really understand their accent.

1117
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:50,060
Thank you.

1118
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:50,420
Mint.

1119
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,340
That's what they said.

1120
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:56,740
Whoa.

1121
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,220
Wow.

1122
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,020
Okay, so it's meant to look like the bottom of the ocean.

1123
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:00,800
Because look at that.

1124
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:02,220
Wow.

1125
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:03,400
Whoa.

1126
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:07,880
Whoa!

1127
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:09,760
Wait.

1128
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,140
There's one in here.

1129
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:18,800
Now you are Kelp.

1130
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,340

1131
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:27,860

1133
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,320
Wait, is there one down here?

1134
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:30,960
Is that one?

1135
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,300
No.

1136
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,100
My eyes do deceive me.

1137
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:38,860

01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:22,000
Oh, there's my abbo.

1144
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,460
You were in the kelp.

1145
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,620
What are you doing in there?

1146
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,950
They will show their name after the credits?

1147
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:32,450
Really?

1148
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:34,550
Wait, are you still in here?

1149
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:35,710
Oh, you're gone.

1150
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,030
Hello.

1151
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,080
Unless you were talking in chat.

1152
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,140
Hold on, I'm making sure there's nothing in there.

1153
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,730
Oh, jellies!

1154
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:02,130
Jellies!

1155
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,960
Jelly, jelly, jelly.

1156
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1157
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:19,930
There's one up here!

1158
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:25,590
Nice.

1159
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:27,210
Good job, team.

1160
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:35,460
Wow.

1161
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,320
It's so beautiful.

1162
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,240
It's so pretty, it makes me mad.

1163
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:43,480
Oh, there's nothing up here, I think.

1164
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:44,580
On this?

1165
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,920
No, it doesn't seem like it.

1166
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,860
We're going down!

1167
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:52,200
Oh!

1168
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,000
Ouch.

1169
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:58,270
You see anything over here?

1170
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,430
No, it doesn't look like it.

1171
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:04,590
Sorry, Eye Boy, I love exploring too much.

1172
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,860
It's okay, Minto!

1173
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,100
That's what they said.

1174
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,440
Nothing here.

1175
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:28,660
This is spooky.

1176
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,920
This is quite spooky.

1177
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:36,500
Are there bosses in this game?

1178
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:37,960
How do you even fight?

1179
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,040
Yeah?

1180
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,340
Oh my gosh.

1181
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:59,040
Um, okay, I spoke.

1182
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:00,340
Did I die?

1183
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:01,420
Get up?

1184
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,480
It was so loud.

1185
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:16,860
That spooked a heckie out of me.

1186
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,920
Okay, did we keep going?

1187
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,820
It was so loud.

1188
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:28,960
Watch out for those.

1189
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,380
I think

1190
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,580
you lost Scarf.

1191
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,500
Did I?

1192
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:39,520
No.

1193
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,680
They damage your scarf permanently.

1194
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,280
Uh-oh.

1195
01:20:58,580 --> 01:20:59,920
Wait, is this a stealth mission?

1196
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:00,940
Oh my gosh.

1197
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,440
Eyebo, I'm scared.

1198
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,440
Eyebo, eyebo, I'm scared.

1199
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,410
Hey, we weren't going after that.

1200
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:19,410
Is this now a sneaking mission?

1201
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:19,990
Oh my gosh.

1202
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:27,220
Oh my god, the music is all scary all of a sudden.

1203
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:28,320
Daibo!

1204
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,100
Daibo, I'm scared!

1205
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,120
We should get higher up ground?

1206
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,340
So that if we need to slide, we can slide.

1207
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,040
You see my vision?

1208
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,500
Wait, did we get up here?

1209
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,580
Or anything?

1210
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,440
Now my scarf looks so short now.

1211
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:53,340
So sad.

1212
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:03,670
Oh my god.

1213
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,500
He's scanning.

1214
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:13,890
Ah!

1215
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:14,590
Sorry.

1216
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:16,350
Oh my god, this is...

1217
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:21,050
That's an alive one!

1218
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:21,510
Okay.

1219
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:23,450
Good to know.

1220
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:26,210
Oh my gosh.

1221
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,550
Eyeball, I'm scared.

1222
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,250
Eyeball, I didn't know this was going to be a horror game.

1223
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:34,330
Eyeball.

1224
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:38,170
Eyeball, I'm scared.

1225
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,540
What if we die?

1226
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,420
Okay, that's one, but now there's two of them.

1227
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,100
And there's the second one above us?

1228
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,060
Oh my god, get under here!

1229
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,120
Don't, don't, don't.

1230
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,600
How do we get out of this mess?

1231
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,540
All big Metal Gear reference.

1232
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:08,120
I got scared while riding the Supa.

1233
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,940
He's circling, yeah!

1234
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,900
He's spawn camping.

1235
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,100
How do we get out of here?

1236
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,300
You take the lead, I bold.

1237
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:19,960
Oh!

1238
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,000
Don't take the lead, Aibo.

1239
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,180
Aibo, take the wheel!

1240
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,240
I'll follow you.

1241
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,760
I think this one's also gonna come alive though, no?

1242
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,920
So yeah, I'll run up here.

1243
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,480
It's gonna be loud!

1244
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:48,460
Aibo!

1245
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:49,760
Aibo!

1246
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:00,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1247
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,060
I am going to turn it down just a tad more for me.

1248
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:06,840
Okay.

1249
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:07,900
All right, we're good.

1250
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,740
There's one over there, isn't there?

1251
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:16,900
I see it, I see it.

1252
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,360
Nice.

1253
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:36,390
Such a good eyeball, yeah.

1254
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:44,630
I saw him with his eye, but I don't...

1255
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:46,910
Oh, I see orange over there.

1256
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:47,970
Okay.

01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:54,870
Wait.

This one's gonna come alive, isn't it?

1262
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:57,530
No?

1263
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:58,330

01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,390
Okay.

One or the other.

1279
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:54,070
Mountains and mountains of graves.

1280
01:26:58,650 --> 01:26:59,470
It looks nighttime.

1281
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:00,330

1286
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,350
They become stars in the sky!

1287
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:13,350
Oh!

1288
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:14,950
Me!

1289
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:19,690
Sleeping under the sand.

1290
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:21,650
They're hibernating.

1291
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:34,940
Let's go, Aibo.

1292
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:36,480
Good job, by the way.

1293
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,460
So are we, like, protected in here?

1294
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:40,280
Can we leave?

1295
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:46,760
Whoa.

1296
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,720
The gravestones.

1297
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:51,720
So these were gravestones.

1298
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:00,030
Full of sand and whimsy.

1299
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:18,500
Sneak through the underground passage without tearing your scarf.

1300
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:20,280
Wait, I got an achievement!

1301
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,820
So wait, maybe I didn't lose any of my scarf.

1302
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:24,900
Yippee!

1303
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:31,280
So I did it.

1304
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:31,740
Okay.

1305
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,600
No hit run.

1306
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,500
If you heard that, that was my phone.

1307
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,900
I kicked off my chair.

1308
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,120
Oopsie.

1309
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,040
What's this?

1310
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,200
It's my stage.

1311
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:02,080
Clumsy Ghost Breaks mode.

1312
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,060
No, I have a screen protector on, but it's gotten a little bumpy.

1313
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,080
It's gotten a little...

1314
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,400
It's...

1315
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:11,820
Yeah.

1316
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:18,500
Um, it has, it doesn't have cracks in it, but it has indents in there for sure.

1317
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:24,720
Wow!

1318
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:27,740
What is it?

1319
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,400
What happened?

1320
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:30,600
Me!

1321
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:31,480
Me!

1322
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:34,720
And the graves!

1323
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,280
Whoa!

1324
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:36,260
Whoa!

1325
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,180
And me!

1326
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,320
Now we can just jump as...

1327
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:47,860
Whoa!

1328
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:48,920
Whoa!

1329
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:00,480
Interesting.

1330
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:01,940
What do you see?

1331
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,400
I see it!

1332
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,020
Oh, oops.

1333
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,140
I fell in the water.

1334
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:11,420
Thank you!

1335
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:16,610
Is there anything...

1336
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:20,330
Let's go to this one.

1337
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:33,350
In here, maybe?

1338
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:37,130
If I...

1339
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:38,550
If I yell really loud...

1340
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:41,350
Okay, nothing happens.

1341
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:43,770
Oh, over there.

1342
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:44,410
Maybe.

1343
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:47,570
Okay.

1344
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:49,810
Hold on, I'm going to replenish here.

1345
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:52,390
Thank you.

1346
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:00,430
Good job, Aibu.

1347
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:06,040
There's eyes!

1348
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:08,240
That's eyes!

1349
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:09,120
That's eyes!

1350
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:12,180
The water.

1351
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:13,360
The jellyfish!

1352
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,520
Oh, oh, the critters.

1353
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,740
I kept saying birds, but they're fish.

1354
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,860
I called them birds.

1355
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:25,700
But they're fish.

1356
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,820
They're all little fish.

1357
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,220
Look at these, even these guys, they're not tiny cloth birds.

1358
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,720
They're fish.

1359
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,500
Wait, was anything in here?

1360
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,000
Oh, it's so beautiful.

1361
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:49,220
They evolved or devolved.

1362
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:51,520
Depending.

1363
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,200
We're going high.

1364
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,060
We're going up.

1365
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,480
Oh, no, no, no.

1366
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:09,190
Where are you?

1367
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:17,760
Where are you?

1368
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,420
Where are you, I bull?

1369
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,020
Over there.

1370
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:23,220
Oh gosh.

1371
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,980
Oh, oh, I see you.

1372
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:27,100
Thank you.

1373
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,240
I'm blind.

1374
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:37,730
Thank you.

1375
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:39,430
Good eyeball.

1376
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:43,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1377
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:47,030
Okay.

1378
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:54,340
Where are you going?

1379
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:56,280
I'm going up.

1380
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,200
We're going up.

1381
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,100
Oh, help me.

1382
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:01,620
Yeah, thank you.

1383
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,360
I made it, somehow.

1384
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:09,640
Oh, good job.

1385
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:10,360
Hello.

1386
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,920
Where do we go from here?

1387
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:15,660
I'm trying to find...

1388
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:16,600
Oh, up there, up there.

1389
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:22,660
Yuppup.

1390
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:27,820
Nice.

1391
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,520
Follow the scarf animal.

1392
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,580
That's us.

1393
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,480
Oh, that's me.

1394
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,640
I'm blocking the cutscene.

1395
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:46,570
Whoa, whoa, big animal!

1396
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:50,550
Good thing they're friends.

1397
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:51,130
Oh my god.

1398
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:58,230
Whoa.

1399
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:00,050
Whoa.

1400
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:09,440
Wait, what's down there?

1401
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:10,260
Did we already...

1402
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,820
Oh, these are the things that we already did.

1403
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:14,040
I'm coming.

1404
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:14,720
I'm coming.

1405
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:18,230
I'll get in there.

1406
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:19,070
Oh gosh.

1407
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:19,950
We're good.

1408
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:21,130
Oh, I'm good.

1409
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:21,570
I'm fine.

1410
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,290
So cool!

1411
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,850
Gosh, our scarves are gonna be so long.

1412
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:30,790
Where'd that guy go?

1413
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:33,430
Yeah, those are the things that we already unlocked.

1414
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:33,910
Okay.

1415
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:37,450
Come on, buddy.

1416
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:48,280
Did you make it?

1417
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:49,940
Yeah?

1418
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:50,400
Okay.

1419
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:00,010
We made some stairs!

1420
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:04,790
There it is!

1421
01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:05,630
Our stairs!

1422
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,240
What do you see?

1423
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,360
Over here?

1424
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:21,620
What?

1425
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,180
Oh, there's another one!

1426
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:26,100
No, we already did this one, though.

1427
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,980
Yeah, how are they able to know that we're doing this stuff?

1428
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,340
Did they see the future?

1429
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,020
I'm not sure.

1430
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:48,980
I like how we float every time we get on these, it's cool.

1431
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:55,640
Yes, more, more, mine and craft.

1432
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,120
The prophecy.

1433
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:03,010
Yeah, that would make sense, huh?

1434
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:03,370
Oh.

1435
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,450
Meow.

1436
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:08,650
Wow.

1437
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:11,190
I love the fish.

1438
01:36:11,930 --> 01:36:13,490
I want scarfish.

1439
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:21,190
Okay.

1440
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,580
Do it.

1441
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:37,580
And then we go downstairs and there's fireworks!

1442
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:42,340
It's gonna keep rising?

1443
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:52,230
I love energy water.

1444
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:56,330
This is how you feel drinking five...

1445
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:58,450
Wait, that's the gum.

1446
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:03,330
Did we see all the... Did we see the...

1447
01:37:03,330 --> 01:37:04,050
Oh, they're...

1448
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:06,370
They're all like lighting up here.

1449
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:07,330
Oh, see?

1450
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:07,650
See?

1451
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:08,870
Like that?

1452
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:13,820
Cool!

1453
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:18,900
Me when I drink five gum.

1454
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,840
I don't know how many pieces of gum are in my tummy.

1455
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:27,300
Hopefully not so many.

1456
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:56,770
Apparently swallowing gum isn't bad.

1457
01:37:58,930 --> 01:37:59,250
Mama!

1458
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:09,300
Yes, I did this.

1459
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:10,580
I did this.

1460
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,600
This is my journey.

1461
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:19,440
I crossed the deserts and I made the bridges and I hopped.

1462
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:24,080
And I saw the buildings and I ran down the stairs.

1463
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:28,180
I went underground.

1464
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:30,460
And I, that was scary.

1465
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,320
I don't want to go back there.

1466
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,940
Oh, now we're going to crawl.

1467
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,940
We're going to crawl through the wind.

1468
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:41,720
Up to the top, top, tippy top mountain.

1469
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:47,150
You and Ible.

1470
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:47,930
Yeah.

1471
01:38:49,610 --> 01:38:51,690
There was at least one roll of bubble tape in my belly.

1472
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:57,470
We gotta crawl!

1473
01:39:00,170 --> 01:39:02,670
We can reach the lips of the mountain!

1474
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:05,650
And give it a big ol' smooch.

1475
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:09,570
Crawling in my crawl!

1476
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:12,430
Celeste time?

1477
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:13,250
Oh geez.

1478
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:16,130
Suddenly it turns into a seven hour stream.

1479
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:23,700
Let's go eyeball.

1480
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:27,600
We're gonna... Are you ready to crawl?

1481
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:28,420
Are you ready to crawl?

1482
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:32,680
Yes or no?

1483
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:37,000
They said, yes, I'm ready to crawl, Minto.

1484
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:39,500
That's what they said.

1485
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,020
Is there anything up here?

1486
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,300
Am I being two?

1487
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,940
The snow!

1488
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:01,840
I thought I had a dirty mind and then he said the same thing.

1489
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:02,480
Dirty?

1490
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,000
Our song has changed once again.

1491
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,240
Oh, thank you!

1492
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:37,140
Oh, wow, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1493
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:41,100
Do these activate?

1494
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:42,340
Well, they do!

1495
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,020
Cute!

1496
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,920
It's so snowy here.

1497
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,620
Oh, there's there's red guys too.

1498
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,240
Wait, is that a bad guy?

1499
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:00,820
He's nice now, right?

1500
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:02,420
Yes.

1501
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:15,310
Why does this game feel almost like playing Peek?

1502
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:20,690
You go through all the different areas.

1503
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:25,900
Ah!

1504
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,000
Nope.

1505
01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:33,310
Oh, we're crawling!

1506
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:35,290
Oh, we're crawling.

1507
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:36,850
Oh, yeah.

1508
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:41,050
Okay, nice.

1509
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:43,850
Successfully crawled.

1510
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:52,170
Okay, alright.

1511
01:41:52,870 --> 01:41:53,230
Oh no!

1512
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:53,870
Ah!

1513
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:55,430
Don't fly, Aibo!

1514
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:56,250
Don't fly!

1515
01:41:57,670 --> 01:41:58,070
Ah!

1516
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:01,570
Aibo, don't fly.

1517
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:12,090
I think you have to wait behind a rock when it comes, right?

1518
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:13,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1519
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:14,210
I was just thinking the same thing.

1520
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:16,250
Oh, don't kick me out, though.

1521
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:16,930
Gosh.

1522
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:22,550
Why is the sand or the snow rumbling like that?

1523
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:26,010
Let's get over to the next one.

1524
01:42:27,530 --> 01:42:28,990
The sky right here.

1525
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:35,240
I think it can take cover behind the pillars.

1526
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:36,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1527
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:46,200
It's not like Titanic where only one person can can get under there, you know?

1528
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:49,260
Or on top of there, I guess.

1529
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:53,580
Run, run, run!

1530
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,020
I will be careful.

1531
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,680
Don't be Rose, I will.

1532
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:05,600
I'll never let go!

1533
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:08,500
Can we just go through?

1534
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:09,570
Is it cool?

1535
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:12,440
Yeah.

1536
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:15,000
Oh no, now they're tinier.

1537
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:19,500
Unless?

1538
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:22,440
You are so chatty.

1539
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:23,880
What's going on?

1540
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,360
I'll never let go of Jack.

1541
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,300
Let's go.

1542
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:28,940
Wait.

1543
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:32,540
Oh, that's a plant.

1544
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:33,280
Wait.

1545
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:34,620
Are you okay?

1546
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:35,500
Are you cold?

1547
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,760
Yeah, it's so cold up here.

1548
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:44,500
Don't worry.

1549
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:51,430
My...

1550
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:54,390
My controller is like...

1551
01:43:54,410 --> 01:44:12,770

1554
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:33,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, aha!

1555
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,340
If there are birds, there is a secret.

1556
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,120
Look at them staring at each other.

1557
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,120
Wow.

1558
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,640
Romeo and Juliet.

1559
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:51,640
Celeste is not really that hard.

1560
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,260
I've heard it's pretty difficult.

1561
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,320
But I guess if you're good at platformers, then you know what would be.

1562
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:57,860
It would be a breeze.

1563
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:08,220
I'm not super used to platformers personally but you ready wait there's more didn't

1564
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:20,560

01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:44,780
okay all right onwards nice and refreshed nice and warm my toes are toasty requires fast reaction celestos I see, I see.

1566
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:51,200
Defrost!

1567
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:53,000
Defrost!

1568
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:54,760
Defrost!

1569
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,320
Defrost!

1570
01:46:58,340 --> 01:46:59,460
I'm gonna go on it?

1571
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:00,740
Defrost!

1572
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:03,380
Defrost!

1573
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,020
Defrost!

1574
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:11,400
Okay.

1575
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:21,330
Huddle for warmth.

1576
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:25,350
Should we take our clothes off so it's skin-to-skin contact?

1577
01:47:26,150 --> 01:47:28,770
That'll probably be the most effective way, no?

1578
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:34,930
I learned that and love Hina.

1579
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:46,270
Um...

1580
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:47,050
Are we in trouble?

1581
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:47,490
Aibo!

1582
01:47:48,790 --> 01:47:49,210
Aibo!

1583
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:49,990
No fly!

1584
01:47:57,290 --> 01:47:58,810
Aibo, are we in trouble?

1585
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:04,510
Why is your scarf?

1586
01:48:04,590 --> 01:48:05,670
My scarf doesn't...

1587
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:08,350
It doesn't freeze up so quickly like yours does.

1588
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:10,570
Maybe it does.

1589
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:11,290
Oh my gosh.

1590
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:14,730
Oh.

1591
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:16,410
Oh.

1592
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:18,510
How did I get on top?

1593
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:20,850
I did not mean to do that.

1594
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,560
Do you even have a skin under the cloth at this game?

1595
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:29,800
Oh, in this game, I thought you meant like...

1596
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:35,080
I was going to be like, well, you know, I'm all ectoplasm, but...

1597
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,380
feel like skin a little.

1598
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:42,020
Oh, my gosh.

1599
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:42,680
Is that me?

1600
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:44,640
Oh, my head's poking out.

1601
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:46,840
I think we can make it.

1602
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:50,000
I can't make it!

1603
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:51,460
I made it.

1604
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:54,300
I'm not gonna make it.

1605
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:55,380
I'm not gonna make it.

1606
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,640
I made it.

1607
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:01,800
Scarf and Mito slippers stays on.

1608
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:03,960
Look at back, Mito.

1609
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:04,620
Thank you.

1610
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,290
Where'd he go?

1611
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:07,900
Where is he?

1612
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:16,020
To the next thing.

1613
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,900
What's that over there?

1614
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:27,820
This guy's a pain in my butt.

1615
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,920
Do do

1616
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:37,250
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

1617
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:42,600
It didn't open anything.

1618
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:44,440
Wait, I'm scared.

1619
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:45,220
Okay, there he is.

1620
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:45,480
Okay.

1621
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,240
I think we just got to go for it, eyeball.

1622
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:51,980
Do we go over there?

1623
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:52,720
Ah!

1624
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:53,940
Ah!

1625
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:01,420
My scarf is running so low!

1626
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:06,280
Ah, warmth.

1627
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:11,870
Are we, uh, I think we're okay, maybe?

1628
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:15,030
He's not actively searching, I think we're okay.

1629
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:17,790
What is that over there though?

1630
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:22,210
Aybo, I want to go!

1631
01:50:26,670 --> 01:50:29,790
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, wait, uh, oh shoot.

1632
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:32,090
Aibo.

1633
01:50:33,330 --> 01:50:34,370
Aibo, did we go the other way?

1634
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:40,450
Aibo, Aibo, Aibo, Aibo!

1635
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:46,310
Secret is that way.

1636
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:47,990
Oh, I see.

1637
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:49,530
Should we try?

1638
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,360
Are we gonna get caught?

1639
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,460
Secrets are worth it?

1640
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:09,860
Aibo!

1641
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:12,740
Aibo, let's go to the secret!

1642
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:15,140
I want to see it!

1643
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:30,680
What is this?

1644
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:33,440
Keep going.

1645
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,120
Aibo!

1646
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:45,980
We're both Screaming together.

1647
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:50,020
Push, push, push, push, push, push, push.

1648
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:57,960
Yes, nice.

1649
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,840
Wait, it even has a second exit, so that's good.

1650
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,100
Oh, hello.

1651
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:05,000
Wow!

1652
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:08,040
Cave.

1653
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:11,440
They all went to the mountain.

1654
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:19,450
They went to the mountain.

1655
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:24,040
What could be there?

1656
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:55,200
like a pilgrimage like a journey when I think when I'm back either when I'm back from Japan or in Japan I think I'm gonna play mist I wanted to honestly play it this week but I only picked games that I could like beat in one sitting so that I wasn't having anything oops having anything that I didn't already have finished.

1657
01:52:57,260 --> 01:52:58,080
Before I left, you know.

1658
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:06,020
Where is that guy?

1659
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:07,200
Oh, there he is.

1660
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:09,200
Oh, I don't think he's...

1661
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,580
Oh, I was going to say I don't think he's actively searching.

1662
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:12,900
But he might be now.

1663
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:13,820
Oh!

1664
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:24,450
Maybe we're okay.

1665
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:26,150
Hello, we're okay.

1666
01:53:26,310 --> 01:53:26,910
I'm scared.

1667
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:30,490
Don't know anything about Mist myself.

1668
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:33,680
I only remember attempting to play it as a wee...

1669
01:53:34,290 --> 01:53:35,210
We ghost.

1670
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:38,870
um failing

1671
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:46,260
we are going the right way still though right

1672
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:55,050
the music is so intense

1673
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:19,440
there's a I don't think he's searching actively right now oh yeah let's go to this one over here oh god uh oh uh oh uh oh I Eyeball!

1674
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:20,080
Eyeball!

1675
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:22,740
Eyeball?

1676
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:25,160
How did he see you?

1677
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:27,320
I guess he is active.

1678
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:29,200
How did he...

1679
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:30,060
How did that...

1680
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:30,260
Ah!

1681
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:35,380
Holy...

1682
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,120
Cow!

1683
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,040
What the heck just happened?

1684
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:41,380
Eyeball!

1685
01:54:52,220 --> 01:54:53,880
Eyeball, don't die on me!

1686
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:57,240
Eyeball!

1687
01:54:58,820 --> 01:54:59,880
Where are you?

1688
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:02,100
Oh, you're right next to me.

1689
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:02,900
Okay.

1690
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:22,760
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1691
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:29,240
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1692
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:35,480
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Running, running.

1693
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,560
Inside, inside, inside.

1694
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:43,840
Hi-bo!

1695
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,240
Hi-bo, hi-bo!

1696
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:49,590
Okay.

1697
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:53,470
Alright.

1698
01:55:54,290 --> 01:55:56,350
Jurassic Park theme would also fit this moment.

1699
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:56,730
Go!

1700
01:55:56,890 --> 01:55:57,370
Hi-bo, go!

1701
01:55:58,330 --> 01:56:01,410
I watched the new Jurassic world.

1702
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:04,510
Ketil-Kolatus is in it.

1703
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:05,810
I was very happy about that.

1704
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:12,330
But, well, I didn't dislike it.

1705
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:13,570
I thought it was fine still.

1706
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:14,170
What is it?

1707
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:15,150
Rebirth, or?

1708
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:22,090
I thought it was fine.

1709
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:31,540
The Gravestones.

1710
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,100
Surprise, I made another one.

1711
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:44,520
I only watched it because Chris Pratt was not in it.

1712
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,240
So, I watched it because he wasn't in it.

1713
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,200
It's now like...

1714
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:57,700
They're like mutant...

1715
01:56:57,700 --> 01:56:59,460
Mutant, uh...

1716
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,260
Dinosaur or something?

1717
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:06,920
Whoa.

1718
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:08,820
Whoa.

1719
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:14,640
As soon as we defrost them, they freeze back up.

1720
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:25,000
No, defrost!

1721
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:25,780
Defrost!

1722
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:31,090
The music!

1723
01:57:32,470 --> 01:57:33,790
It's so beautiful.

1724
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:39,210
I'm assuming is there stuff down here?

1725
01:57:41,050 --> 01:57:41,890
Is there secret stuff?

1726
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:43,750
Hold on, let me check, let me look around.

1727
01:57:46,110 --> 01:57:47,970
I feel like there's probably something in there.

1728
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:49,470
No?

1729
01:57:49,670 --> 01:57:49,910
Nothing?

1730
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:51,750
Okay.

1731
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:53,010
Thank you, guys.

1732
01:57:58,070 --> 01:57:59,590
Nothing important at this point.

1733
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:06,960
Come on, Aibo!

1734
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:16,440
Why do you hate the guy who's gonna play you in the Phantom Movie?

1735
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:17,000
Don't say it!

1736
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:21,420
Everybody knows Jack Black will play me.

1737
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:26,740
Ooh, breezy!

1738
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:29,300
Watch out!

1739
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:31,720
Don't get swept away now.

1740
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:34,520
Anything over here?

1741
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:34,940
No.

1742
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:38,200
You don't have to follow me, Aibo.

1743
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,360
I'm just looking.

1744
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:45,930
Wee!

1745
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:51,030
Hold your ground!

1746
01:58:51,690 --> 01:58:53,230
Stay strong!

1747
01:58:53,890 --> 01:58:55,570
Hold your ground, hold your ground.

1748
01:58:55,830 --> 01:58:59,430
Oh my gosh.

1749
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:00,490
Oh my gosh!

1750
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:01,110
Oh my gosh!

1751
01:59:01,850 --> 01:59:06,930
Hold your ground.

1752
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:08,610
Run, run, run.

1753
01:59:09,690 --> 01:59:11,050
Run, run, run, run, run.

1754
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:15,910
Ow, I fall!

1755
01:59:16,730 --> 01:59:17,410
Hold!

1756
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:18,350
Hold!

1757
01:59:19,230 --> 01:59:19,950
Hold on!

1758
01:59:20,270 --> 01:59:21,650
Maybe we can make it to the next ledge.

1759
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:22,370
Over here!

1760
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:24,190
Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, nice, nice, nice, nice.

1761
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:35,500
Uh-oh.

1762
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,580
Yeah, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

1763
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:38,220
We're not fine.

1764
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:38,920
Everything's bad.

1765
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:41,300
Hang right!

1766
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:42,560
Hang right!

1767
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:46,260
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1768
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:53,140
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1769
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:57,900
Okay, maybe.

1770
01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:01,400
Oh my gosh, there's like, oh my gosh, wait, this is evil.

1771
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:04,800
Oh!

1772
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:06,040
Ah!

1773
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:06,080
Ah!

1774
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:13,660
Hi, Bo.

1775
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:14,640
Hi, Bo.

1776
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,220
I feel like that has to happen.

1777
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:17,120
Maybe?

1778
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:18,560
Okay.

1779
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:23,800
Oh, oh, I went into the snow.

1780
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:41,560
Oh.

1781
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:43,040
Whoa.

1782
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:44,960
Wait, where are we?

1783
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:45,420
Okay.

1784
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:50,360
Yeah, our scarf is so small now.

1785
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:53,580
What happened to it?

1786
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:57,260
Does it keep getting blown away?

1787
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:57,740
Whoa!

1788
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:02,580
Oh my gosh, just go, I will go, go!

1789
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:03,700
It's cold.

1790
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:04,820
Is it?

1791
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:06,000
It keeps breaking off?

1792
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:06,700
Is that why?

1793
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:14,980
Oh my gosh, our scarves are so small now!

1794
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,240
Oh no, no, we have to make it!

1795
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:20,400
And there's a bad guy.

1796
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:21,680
Oh my gosh, big baddie.

1797
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:26,000
Oh, I can

1798
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:31,760
do is sing.

1799
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,140
Push, push, push!

1800
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:41,120
Push, push, push!

1801
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:51,560
The mountain looks so far away, though.

1802
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,700
The peak looks so far away.

1803
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:55,880
Oh, my gosh.

1804
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:57,560
Huddle close.

1805
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,520
Huddle close.

1806
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:10,920
Oh, my gosh.

1807
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:11,520
There's so many...

1808
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,540
How did they put the gravestones up here?

1809
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:16,920
We've come so far.

1810
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,260
We can't freeze over now.

1811
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:19,540
We can't.

1812
02:02:28,190 --> 02:02:29,030
We're slower.

1813
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:30,810
We're getting slower, I think.

1814
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:34,090
No, no, no.

1815
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:35,610
No, we're getting slower.

1816
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:40,110
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1817
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:45,580
No, no, no.

1818
02:02:45,580 --> 02:02:47,620
Just keep... I'm pushing as hard as I can.

1819
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:51,640
You can't even hear my voice anymore!

1820
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:57,840
Oh my gosh, we're almost there.

1821
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,460
Wait, the top of the mountain is gone.

1822
02:02:59,580 --> 02:02:59,980
Are we here?

1823
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:01,100
Wait, where are we?

1824
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:02,380
Oh my god, no!

1825
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:05,880
This is like actually going up to Everest!

1826
02:03:07,740 --> 02:03:10,140
We gotta start taking our clothes off!

1827
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:14,820
No!

1828
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:17,400
No!

1829
02:03:23,050 --> 02:03:23,490
No!

1830
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:25,970
No!

1831
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:26,410
No, don't stop.

1832
02:03:26,710 --> 02:03:27,670
Don't stop moving, eyeball.

1833
02:03:28,510 --> 02:03:30,290
I'm sorry, my head is blocking eyeball.

1834
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:05,430
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

1835
02:04:10,350 --> 02:04:13,010
boom boom Is that my ancestors, question mark?

1836
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:17,070
They're judging me.

1837
02:04:17,290 --> 02:04:18,510
They say even you failed.

1838
02:04:19,150 --> 02:04:21,290
You were supposed to be the prophesized one.

1839
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:28,740
Save me, bird woman.

1840
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:37,780
Yes!

1841
02:04:51,550 --> 02:04:52,270
Wow!

1842
02:04:54,170 --> 02:05:01,850
saying oh my god okay avoid those guys

1843
02:05:09,850 --> 02:05:14,850
and even further beyond

1844
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:30,330
eyeball is that you eyeball Eyeball, look.

1845
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:38,360
Eyeball, it's so beautiful.

1846
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:00,340
Well, now here.

1847
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:01,320
Inside?

1848
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:03,680
Okay.

1849
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:07,600
Wee!

1850
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:13,740
Are you

1851
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:24,140
behind me?

1852
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:41,800
Whoa!

1853
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:48,320
Mito just too fast.

1854
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:50,060
My bad.

1855
02:06:51,020 --> 02:06:52,320
Hi Boa, we're here together.

1856
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:53,020
We're here together.

1857
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:56,820
I'm zooming.

1858
02:06:58,340 --> 02:07:00,060
If I'm missing stuff, sorry.

1859
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:02,560
I'm just having too much fun.

1860
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:15,840
No secrets here?

1861
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:16,360
Okay!

1862
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:17,420
Thank you!

1863
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:32,760
I should go further up but I don't know how to move.

1864
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:35,180
Wait, I'm stuck.

1865
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:36,000
Wait.

1866
02:07:40,830 --> 02:07:42,530
I messed up.

1867
02:07:42,830 --> 02:07:43,150
Wait.

1868
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:49,190
There we go.

1869
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:52,450
There we go, there we go.

1870
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:02,620
Where'd my eyeball go?

1871
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:05,400
Oh, there you are.

1872
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,200
Aw, did you wait for me?

1873
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:09,200
Much better eyeball than me.

1874
02:08:26,210 --> 02:08:27,490
I'm gonna kiss them!

1875
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:30,190
Those sweet, sweet thighs!

1876
02:08:50,090 --> 02:08:52,590
Wow, it's so beautiful.

1877
02:08:53,770 --> 02:08:54,750
It's so beautiful.

1878
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:14,380
Oh, you can't hear my voice in here.

1879
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,160
I'm trying to talk to you, Eibu.

1880
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:29,820
Can you hear me?

1881
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,720
Wait, our scarf is once again gone.

1882
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:42,720
Don't get so close to me.

1883
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:46,940
Eibu.

1884
02:09:49,650 --> 02:09:50,650
Keep your distance.

1885
02:09:58,950 --> 02:10:01,210
Oh, don't get caught on the rocks, seriously.

1886
02:10:09,110 --> 02:10:12,390
You can still see me trying to talk to him.

1887
02:10:14,370 --> 02:10:15,650
No eye in this eyeball.

1888
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:20,070
We're going into the lie.

1889
02:10:20,250 --> 02:10:21,490
We're going into the lie.

1890
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:36,380
There they go.

1891
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:38,560
There they go.

1892
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:39,760
There we go.

1893
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:50,670
Look at us with just two little triangles.

1894
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:05,690
I can't tell if I still see us or if that's a speck on my monitor.

1895
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:10,970
It's a speck on my monitor.

1896
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:32,880
Oh my god, it's happening.

1897
02:11:44,820 --> 02:11:48,420
Thank you for playing Journey.

1898
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:04,560
Wow.

1899
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:09,160
Who's that?

1900
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:23,500
It's going inside.

1901
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:40,450
Well,

1902
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:46,620
all the places we passed.

1903
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:48,200
Our journey, our journey.

1904
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:49,480
Our journey.

1905
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:51,880
We didn't really travel so far, huh?

1906
02:12:58,770 --> 02:13:02,530
Sometimes the journey is harsh and bleak, but all you can do is keep going.

1907
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:09,750
And the whole thing that... and it's the whole thing that makes you you yeah Thank you Murphy

1909
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:37,100
You know, I appreciate all sorts of journeys.

1910
02:13:37,700 --> 02:13:39,380
All throughout life and afterlife.

1911
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:56,840
I don't think they warned people there'd be co-op.

1912
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:57,820
Oh, really?

1913
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:08,400
Yeah, the gameplay and aesthetics are very satisfying.

1914
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:09,320
That's very true.

1915
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:12,740
Oh.

1916
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:27,640

1919
02:15:07,530 --> 02:15:08,090
Okay.

1920
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:10,990
It got even more beautiful.

1921
02:15:11,150 --> 02:15:12,350
Now I'm super mad.

1922
02:15:14,750 --> 02:15:17,030
Ibo, don't go, aren't we the star together?

1923
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:31,030
Oh, there it is.

1924
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:47,700
Companions met along the way.

1925
02:16:28,150 --> 02:16:30,870
What a reveal!

1926
02:16:35,550 --> 02:16:37,290
Thank you, Cash Money Robot!

1927
02:16:45,430 --> 02:16:50,060
I've never only seen one companion before.

1928
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:53,440
What do you mean?

1929
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:55,200
Is that about how many times you've played?

1930
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:58,800
Because this is my first time playing.

1931
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:03,820
Legendary way to end.

1932
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,000
My starting one left.

1933
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:08,520
Oh!

1934
02:17:09,020 --> 02:17:10,420
Oh, wait, I did get some achievements.

1935
02:17:10,580 --> 02:17:11,580
Let me see what they were.

1936
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:14,180
Library.

1937
02:17:14,180 --> 02:17:14,620
Journey.

1938
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:16,100
I unlocked.

1939
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:20,060
Reaching the summit with a companion and return to the beginning.

1940
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:24,060
Finish the game and return to the beginning.

1941
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:28,080
Oh wait, so if you don't even have your companion, I guess if they die, right?

1942
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:31,120
It was Cash Money Robot, they said so earlier.

1943
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:38,720
Truly the deep emotional-spiritual connection we formed on this journey with Cash Money Robot.

1944
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:45,160
That was the best reveal.

1945
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:45,620
Ah!

1946
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:48,180
Thank you for being my eyeball!

1947
02:17:57,170 --> 02:17:58,810
That was such a good reveal.

1948
02:18:01,690 --> 02:18:02,730
faded in.

1949
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:04,350
Let's see.

1950
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:08,030
Finish the game with the same partner for the majority of the journey and return to the beginning.

1951
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:11,130
Only 14% of players have that achievement.

1952
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:11,830
Wow.

1953
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:19,470
Well, thank you, Cashman, you robot, for for what's the word?

1954
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:25,470
For being my companion and finishing the game with me.

1955
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:26,790
I really appreciate it.

1956
02:18:27,930 --> 02:18:28,690
Let's see.

1957
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:31,050
I'm looking at some of the locked achievements.

1958
02:18:31,070 --> 02:18:34,070
Start the journey again after a week-long break, okay?

1959
02:18:34,650 --> 02:18:35,970
It's like cookie clicker.

1960
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:39,230
Find the hidden desert flower.

1961
02:18:39,570 --> 02:18:40,410
Oh, interesting.

1962
02:18:41,130 --> 02:18:43,070
Discover all cloth creatures in the desert.

1963
02:18:43,330 --> 02:18:45,230
Oh, we didn't find all of them?

1964
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:50,750
Meet 10 or more unique travelers.

1965
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:54,230
Sit and meditate with another player for more than 20 seconds.

1966
02:18:54,990 --> 02:18:55,650
How do you sit?

1967
02:18:58,330 --> 02:19:01,010
Maybe if I stop moving, it's an idle animation.

1968
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:05,270
Find a mysterious creature hidden in the temple.

1969
02:19:06,770 --> 02:19:10,350
Collect all unique glowing symbols across one or more journeys.

1970
02:19:11,410 --> 02:19:13,710
Cross the broken bridge without completely rebuilding it.

1971
02:19:14,630 --> 02:19:15,730
Ooh, cool.

1972
02:19:16,690 --> 02:19:18,430
Uncover all 10 ancient glyphs.

1973
02:19:18,510 --> 02:19:19,170
Dang it.

1974
02:19:19,690 --> 02:19:22,470
Pass through 15 gates while surfing through the sunken city.

1975
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:23,350
Dang it.

1976
02:19:25,410 --> 02:19:26,890
You just go AFK.

1977
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:27,970
Ah, okay, okay.

1978
02:19:31,480 --> 02:19:32,900
You did a lot of stuff for me.

1979
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:34,520
No, these are not the things that I did.

1980
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:35,600
These are the locked ones.

1981
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:38,220
These are the ones that you can still get.

1982
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:39,880
I only got four achievements.

1983
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:42,380
Which was...

1984
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:45,740
Sneak through the underground passage without tearing your scarf.

1985
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:47,800
Finish the game and return to the beginning.

1986
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:51,360
Reach the summit with a companion and return to the beginning.

1987
02:19:51,900 --> 02:19:54,740
And finish the game with the same partner for the majority of the journey.

1988
02:19:55,180 --> 02:19:56,060
And return to the beginning.

1989
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:00,280
Yeah.

1990
02:20:02,620 --> 02:20:04,740
You can get those outside the map in the sun.

1991
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:05,040
city.

1992
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:05,900
Wait, get what?

1993
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:12,860
Pretty nice game to replay, too.

1994
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:13,720
Seems like it, right?

1995
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:16,820
If you get all scarf upgrades, you unlock white robes.

1996
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:17,880
Really?

1997
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:19,400
Oh, cool.

1998
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:21,780
I do want to maybe play again.

1999
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:26,800
Maybe one day, like, a member stream or something, and somebody can help me get through.

2000
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:29,880
We can play more together, like, more games together.

2001
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:35,380
And maybe, like, different people can help me get different things or something like that.

2002
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:37,760
Mm-hmm.

2003
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:39,960
So pretty.

2004
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:40,840
Wee!

2005
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:42,180
So pretty!

2006
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:43,460
Oh my gosh.

2007
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:45,100
Wee!

2008
02:20:48,350 --> 02:20:48,910
Wee!

2009
02:20:50,610 --> 02:20:51,170
Hmm.

2010
02:20:56,640 --> 02:20:59,060
Still need to get an Ocelot skin from Foxhunt.

2011
02:20:59,200 --> 02:20:59,520
I know.

2012
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:03,780
The game matches you with a different companion whenever you change map.

2013
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:05,740
The magic is that you don't know it.

2014
02:21:05,860 --> 02:21:09,220
It's rare to make a journey with only one partner, but with less online players.

2015
02:21:09,740 --> 02:21:10,240
Oh!

2016
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:12,280
I see!

2017
02:21:12,900 --> 02:21:17,300
So first playthrough, you only match with first players, which makes the population the match smaller.

2018
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:18,180
Wow!

2019
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:19,940
Oh my gosh!

2020
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:22,000
Also, thank you so much for the Aka doing a...

2021
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,260
Aka super, thank you!

2022
02:21:26,820 --> 02:21:27,700
Oh, wow!

2023
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:30,900
Wait, so like, if someone else were trying to play...

2024
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:35,320
And...

2025
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:39,020
Like...

2026
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:41,180
Wow, so the fact that we...

2027
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:45,020
That it was me and Cash Money Robot the whole time is, like, super...

2028
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:45,300
rare?

2029
02:21:46,260 --> 02:21:47,480
That's crazy!

2030
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:54,060
Wait, that's so cool though at the same time.

2031
02:21:58,340 --> 02:21:58,880
Wowee!

2032
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:02,560
It will only swap if you get too far away from each other.

2033
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:06,920
Because online is low probably.

2034
02:22:07,060 --> 02:22:13,460
Yeah, probably nowadays it's pretty easy to get that achievement I'd say.

2035
02:22:13,860 --> 02:22:15,300
If, well, Hmm?

2036
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:17,600
Maybe.

2037
02:22:26,340 --> 02:22:29,000
Oh, I'm looking at like some of the other achievements.

2038
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:31,580
The Ancestors One.

2039
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:34,040
Find a mysterious creature hidden in the temple.

2040
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:35,860
Only 8% of players.

2041
02:22:36,580 --> 02:22:38,920
Collect all unique glowing symbols across one or more journeys.

2042
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:39,840
8%!

2043
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:46,820
Back in the day, there was a dedicated community of white cloak players that would guide people through the game and help them find all the secrets.

2044
02:22:47,300 --> 02:22:48,340
That's so sweet!

2045
02:22:49,220 --> 02:22:50,220
That's so cute.

2046
02:22:52,540 --> 02:22:54,360
Well guys, thank you.

2047
02:22:54,380 --> 02:22:56,780
Well, that's another game off the list, I suppose.

2048
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,440
Another completion.

2049
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:01,300
Let me add it to my...

2050
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:04,280
To my...

2051
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:05,100
Try Princess!

2052
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:06,900
Thank you!

2053
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:11,940
Also Daily Dio, I'm so sorry I think I missed your don't know earlier.

2054
02:23:12,820 --> 02:23:14,900
It's one of my favorite games of all time, short and sweet.

2055
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:15,800
Just like me too.

2056
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:17,700
Alright.

2057
02:23:19,860 --> 02:23:20,540
Let's see.

2058
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:23,020
18.

2059
02:23:27,380 --> 02:23:29,360
How many do we have left then?

2060
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:31,800
Uh...

2061
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:32,380
11!

2062
02:23:33,480 --> 02:23:37,800
11 games left and I'll have completed...

2063
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:38,240
50.

2064
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:38,680
Whoa!

2065
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:40,360
Come back to pink.

2066
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:42,500
Thank you!

2067
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:43,900
Pink for the sunset tan!

2068
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:48,300
It was scary to lose the scarf in the snow, though not sure taking clothes off would have held.

2069
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:50,700
Thankfully the real scarf was you all on!

2070
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:52,240
Thank you, Darko!

2071
02:23:53,060 --> 02:23:55,380
Thank you so much for the peek.

2072
02:23:56,580 --> 02:23:59,220
And yu yu yu yu yu yu yu yu yu yu yu yu yuni!

2073
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:05,800
Thanks for this astonishing and beautiful experience, Minky and Cash Buddy Robot!

2074
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:11,480
I've never played this game, but it did bring me beautiful memories of Sky Children, and of the Light and Abzu.

2075
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:13,360
Oh yeah, I might!

2076
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:15,300
I might check out the other games by...

2077
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:20,340
by this team, so...

2078
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:28,920
I stretch.

2079
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:31,360
Oh, I've been...

2080
02:24:31,360 --> 02:24:33,020
It's been a very busy day for me.

2081
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:36,320
I woke up and immediately started getting to work.

2082
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:38,920
Not only on catch-up from stuff that I...

2083
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:41,780
That I missed, but like...

2084
02:24:41,780 --> 02:24:43,060

2089
02:24:51,220 --> 02:24:52,360

Um, and I have some collabs this week.

2099
02:26:17,580 --> 02:26:21,460

2100
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:26,000
So, it's a pretty packed week.

better the screen protector than my own phone though right
