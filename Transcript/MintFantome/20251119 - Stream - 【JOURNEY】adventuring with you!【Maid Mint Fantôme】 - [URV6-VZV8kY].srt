I was going to have it on the...

19
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,340
On the...

20
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,300
The starting...

21
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:20,820
Sooo!

22
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,960
Starting...

23
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,640
Starting Scoooon!

24
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:23,940
No!

25
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,920
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

26
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,540
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

27
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,300
The dot EXE is important.

28
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,420
Don't forget it.

29
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,980
Exactly.

30
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,300
Exactly.

31
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,260
It's there, too.

32
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
starting skewed

33
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,580
ah i was gone for a couple days but i did stream once oh my
gosh i said i was going to stream more than once and i was

34
00:06:51,580 --> 00:07:01,780
so optimistic i i keep doing this i keep doing this where
i'm like oh i could stream i could stream but honestly it

35
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,180
was such a crazy amount of time that i was

36
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,800
I could at least stream once, though.

37
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,900
But it's all good.

38
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,680
It's all good.

39
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,800
We were so busy.

40
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,660
I was.

41
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,600
I was.

42
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,300
$110 stream.

43
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,380
No, no, no.

44
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,680
My data plan caps.

45
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,520
It's all good.

46
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,140
Ambition is cute.

47
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,920
I, the thing is, too, is like, I bring my whole travel
setup, which is very heavy.

48
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,780
And I want to, I feel like if I...

49
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,180
I bring it because I want to use it, obviously.

50
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,720
Like, I don't bring it just to carry it.

51
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,540
Like, I want to use it.

52
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,080
And so I become very ambitious.

53
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,280
And even if I can stream once, I feel like that's worth it
more than...

54
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,020
If I can...

55
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,300
You know, if I bring it and stream once, it's more worth it
than...

56
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,260
than not...

57
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,540
than bringing it and not using it at all, obviously.

58
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,500
I missed you when you were gone.

59
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,280
Ah, I missed you guys, too!

60
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,440
It was my birthday a few days ago!

61
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,960
As well as roughly a year since I started watching you!

62
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,260
I wanted to say thank you for being my com-yosey!

63
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,280
That I look forward to the upcoming debut!

64
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,360
Thank you!

65
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,120
Happy birthday, Ben!

66
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,580
Ben Birdland.

67
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,560
Ben, what is it?

68
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,780
Ben Birdland?

69
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,620
Or Ben Birdland?

70
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,060
Ben-Bland.

71
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,860
Ben?

72
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,500
Blah, blah, blah.

73
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,240
Hold on, I'm kidding.

74
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,860
Happy birthday.

75
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,700
Oh,

76
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:55,520
geez.

77
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,980
Oh, geez.

78
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:58,640
No.

79
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,860
Thank you for serving me.

80
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,880
I got FNAF 2 Popeyes combo yesterday.

81
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,180
Give me food poisoning.

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,020
Wait, J-R.

83
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,840
Wait, my tummy also hurt today.

84
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,920
But I did not have Popeyes.

85
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,400
The cake was super mid, and worst of all, they didn't even
give me any packaging.

86
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:22,200
into the movie wait that's the worst me to go brr did you
really spend 110 in data because you missed us i i said so

87
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,280
many times that my thing caps at like 80 dollars okay it
caps at 80.

88
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,900
so no i didn't It's been $110.

89
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,680
This is false advertising.

90
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,960
$12.30 though.

91
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,620
Yes!

92
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:40,880
Taito!

93
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,400
Thank you.

94
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,720
$80 is so much better than $110.

95
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,340
Yeah.

96
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,800
It's okay.

97
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,560
It's all good.

98
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,800
It's all good.

99
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,460
And what's so silly too is the day after.

100
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:07,720
So basically what had happened is I tried to sign in so
backing up i was at a hotel i was at a i was at a hotel and

101
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:18,820
you'll have to sign in with your login to get free wi-fi at
the hotel are we following i have an account at said hotel

102
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:27,500

We can't log you in.

105
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:43,440
But now that I think about it, I think the hotel had Wi-Fi
that you could pay for.

106
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,540
And it was like $10.

107
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,080
Wait a second.

108
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,750
Wait a second.

109
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:22,690

Do you guys hear that popping?

116

What is that?

122
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,130
Weird.

123
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:37,730
Haunted.

124
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,350
It was like...

125
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,930
It was ASMR.

126
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,710
You don't hear it anymore, though, right?

127
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,510
I don't either.

128
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,970
Is it...

129
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,530
It's .exe because you guys are evil!

130
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,010
Like Sonic Jump.

131
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,170
Every .exe is evil.

132
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:00,790
So true.

133
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,810
Me, brain smooth and tired today.

134
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,270
Make you make brain good and full of energy.

135
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,310
Brain go, yippee!

136
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,790
Also, milk.

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,150
Thank you for the...

138
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,970
Super chat.

139
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,730
Yeah, don't hear it anymore.

140
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,830
I think it's because maybe I was clicked out of the game.

141
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,250
MVP drowned.

142
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,430
Haunted is on brand true.

143
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,770
Now, Miasa would like to buy one megabyte per hour Wi-Fi
access, please.

144
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,370
Did the gummy bear charger come under?

145
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,530
You guys.

146
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,390
You guys might...

147
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,520
They said it would explode.

148
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,220
They said it would explode.

149
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,930
I'm so sad.

150
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,870
I'm actually so sad.

151
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,390
I wouldn't.

152
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,710
I don't care if it'll explode.

153
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,370
I had a little gummy bear on it.

154
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,290
I don't care.

155
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,480
Too much power.

156
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,580
Arevo Charger exploding is on bread.

157
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,920
I know.

158
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,700
I know.

159
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
So I think I'll give up.

160
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,040
How sad.

161
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,620
I'm so sad.

162
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,060
I mean...

163
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,720
Where else?

164
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,440
Now, I hope they realize that there's a market for very cute
chargers.

165
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,420
Alright, Anchor.

166
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,040

167
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,620
Put gummy bears on your chargers.

168
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,240
I need it right now.

169
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,320

170
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,260

174
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,980

175
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,420
No!

176
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,620
Oh no, all dot EXEs are evil.

177
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,700
Better delete them from the computer right now!

178
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,300
No, do not do this.

179
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,480
Yeah, do not do that.

180
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,600
Looking forward to MVP debuts?

181
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,440
Thank you!

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,940
Can't wait to see you all shining bright, making your dreams
a reality.

183
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,820
Also, I miss you, Vito.

184
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,160
Thank you, Phil!

185
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,920
Thank you so much.

186
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,880
Thank you.

187
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,860
I tried Albany's gummies before.

188
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,540
Not Albany.

189
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,820
Is this a D's joke?

190
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,180
I hope you're having a great day, Vito.

191
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,920
You too.

192
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,740
Almost got the one-year badge.

193
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,660
I got a new job today.

194
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,520
Paul, thank you.

195
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,780
Oh, congratulations.

196
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,900
Pretty good day so far.

197
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,600
Have a good stream.

198
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,940
Have a good day.

199
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,860
Have a better day.

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,720
Have the bestest day.

201
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
Keep having a good day.

202
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,520
Keep going.

203
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,380
Wait, oh my gosh.

204
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,020
I'm trying to read the super chats that I missed earlier.

205
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,160
But the YouTube sucks.

206
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,700
Sorry.

207
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,200
Okay, I think I got it.

208
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,460
We just turned the game music all the way up.

209
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,940
It's like pretty high right now.

210
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,680
I think it'll, uh, I think right now it's just the ambience,
but it should, it should be up.

211
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,520
How was they cancel my gummy bear charger?

212
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,100
They said it would explode the most mint-fantile thing ever.

213
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,040
Can you ever, wait, have you ever seen the U-green Uno?

214
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,480
It's kind of cute.

215
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,360
I haven't.

216
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,700
Is that a charger?

217
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,580
Is it okay if I name my new kitty after you?

218
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,720
Of course!

219
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,780
What is it gonna be, mean kitty?

220
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,170
Hmm.

221
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,970
Yul Green approve.

222
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,150
I usually get Anchor stuff.

223
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,370
Not the card game.

224
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,170
Hold on, I'm going to look it up like right now.

225
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,550
Yul, Yul Green, Uno.

226
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,050
I've never heard of this brand before.

227
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,430
Wait, that's kind of cute.

228
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,550
That is cute.

229
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,110
It's like a little robot guy.

230
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,310
He's smiling even.

231
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,330
Wait, this is so cute.

232
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,950
He's kind of like...

233
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,730
That's what he's like.

234
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,290
Anchor is pretty solid for all cords and power banks.

235
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,570
Yeah, I feel like they've got a good thing going.

236
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,930
Wow, I'll look into this hue green.

237
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,410
Thank you for the suggestion.

238
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,910
That's cute.

239
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,330
It's been a year so fast.

240
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:36,810
Wow!

241
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,130
Ghost cutie.

242
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,970
Wait, that's 15 months is more than a year.

243
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,530
Thank you, though.

244
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,530

I feel though this trip, my upcoming trip is pretty busy.

250
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,420
It was a vacation, a short vacation, and then it suddenly
was just like, oh, you're in Japan?

251
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,820
Do you want to do this work?

252
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,580

me waking up early and going to do something.

260
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:32,840
And so I'm like, well, I even have time to stream in the
morning in Japan so that I can then stream at my normal

261
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,460
time.

262
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,600
Some of us are on JST.

263
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,760
Then it'll be perfect for you.

264
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,700
Maybe.

265
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,440
Night Japan is perfect EU.

266
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,280
Sounds great.

267
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,620
Yeah, there you go.

268
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,680
So, hmm.

269
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:56,640
So, the timing might be a little varied, but I'll do my best
to stream, even if it's morning of EST.

270
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,120
Yes, yes, just giving you guys a heads up since my morning
so far, so busy, it seems right now.

271
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,360
Can't wait for Friday.

272
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,920
Me too!

273
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,360
Actually, I can't wait for Friday.

274
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,720
I still have so much to do.

275
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,780
Isn't a nice surprise this game in Okami were peak video
games or art games for my teenage years.

276
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,120
I played Okami, but I'm surprised.

277
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,520
And I always saw this game.

278
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,680
I don't know why I never played it.

279
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,980
I think maybe I did not have the console.

280
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,740
What was it?

281
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,660
Like PS3?

282
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,520
But I did play Okami.

283
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,860
Yeah, I didn't have PS3.

284
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,440
Hmm.

285
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,760
I didn't get one until I was like, okay.

286
00:20:51,200 --> 00:21:02,680
time to stream and play Metal Gear Solid 4 so yeah this game
kind of fell off my radar and now I get to play it now and

Well, yeah.

300
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,320
People's reactions to that were very funny.

301
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:36,700
Honestly, I guess, yeah, like, there was, you know, I talked
about it, and I described it quite in a funny way.

302
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,520
It was also so long ago that I don't remember every little
tiny aspect of it.

303
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,900
But then people were, like, commenting saying, like, oh, she
probably did something like this.

304
00:22:47,900 --> 00:23:00,940
and I was like oh yeah I do remember doing that so it was it
was yeah it was a job and and the thing too is like we

305
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:15,420
worked with some major like Japanese manufacturing companies
like the the places that like build the big the big like um

306
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:34,640

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,600
thank you Mito smiling so much it hurts right now

308
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,140
Vinto used to bint the boats was interested to hear that in
your last stream.

309
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:54,260
It was, I've, as someone who is dead, I have the phrase,
lived many lives.

310
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,680
It's quite accurate for me, maybe.

311
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,260
Do you know the other game?

312
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:06,850
What?

313
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,450
If you want to hear more about that, you can go to my
previous stream.

314
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,830
We're going to play Journey!

315
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,290
Journey, journey, journey.

316
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,910
I'm very excited.

317
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:26,250
I saw that this one was pretty short, and I, unfortunately,
I have meetings with the other Densitoo Gurleys.

318
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:30,390
Well, not meetings, but we're meeting up basically every
night this week.

319
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:38,270
So many, many things that we have to finalize and stuff.

320
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,770
So don't stop believing me, don't think.

321
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,270
Thank you!

322
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,790
So, yeah, busy, busy, busy for sure.

So let's get started then.

324

Let's start.

325
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,090
Let's go on our journey.

326
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,530
Well, you end up playing with a wisp.

327
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,250
I don't know.

328
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,970
Isn't it like, I don't know really anything about this game,
but I think like you get paired up with someone and it's

329
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,930
random or something.

330
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,050
So excited for your idol debut.

331
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,650
Thank you.

332
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,330
Wow.

333
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,040
I'm playing a PC on Steam, so.

334
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,420
Whoa.

335
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:49,920
Whoa.

336
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,950
Wow.

337
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,650
Was that me?

338
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,270
Yes.

339
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,730
I'm on controller.

340
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:11,930
Yeah.

341
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,390
Oh, whoa.

342
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,710
Oh, it's telling me to look around.

343
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,530
Wow!

344
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,110
That's me.

345
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,470
That's telling me to move.

346
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,970
Look at the sand!

347
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,250
Oh, it looks so edible.

348
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:31,890
Oh, wow.

349
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,070
Wow!

350
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,590
Oh!

351
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,410
What did I do?

352
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,170
What is that?

353
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,100
I could be go!

354
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,540
Go, go, go, go.

355
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:48,860
Kuala.

356
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,520
QR code.

357
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,360
What?

358
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,260
Oh, whoa.

359
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,380
Heavy.

360
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,020
Look at that.

361
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,480
Look at that.

362
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,320
So cool.

363
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,840
Everyone has always been saying how beautiful and beautiful
this game looks and sounds.

364
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,860
Anakin seething right now.

365
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,680
Yeah, he is.

366
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,140
Wow.

367
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:18,540
Wow.

368
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,220
Journey!

369
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,560
Just a small town, girl.

370
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,400
Oh, we're still going.

371
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,240
What are these in the sand, though?

372
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,720
They're not gravestones, are they?

373
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,420
Is that gonna be me?

374
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,280
Hello?

375
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,260
Hello?

376
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,420
You are called...

377
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,920
Scan my, scan for my mixtape.

378
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,200
Keyblade graveyard.

379
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,340
Oh my gosh.

380
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
These definitely...

381
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,480
They have like little symbols on them.

382
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,190
Are they different?

383
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,990
If they're different than their gravestones.

384
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,610
Hmm.

385
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:26,810
Hmm.

386
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,850
There's some bullets up there.

387
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,250
there.

388
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,790
Get those guys.

389
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:36,690
Wait.

390
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,610
Can I hop?

391
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,530
Okay, he hops all on his own.

392
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,070
Wait!

393
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,070
Is that my symbol?

394
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,430
No.

395
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,210
Who is it?

396
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,350
I'm calling somebody!

397
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,930
Pick up the phone!

398
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,290
Whoa!

399
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,030
Whoa!

400
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,710
Whoa!

401
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,590
Oh, okay.

402
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:29,110
I can only do that when these guys replenish my thing.

403
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,890
Well, luckily there's many of them!

404
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,250
Oh, nice.

405
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,090
Nice roll.

406
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,210
Are they the spirits of my ancestors?

407
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,310
Well, I want to go in there, but I feel like I should be
following.

408
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:58,950
Because...

409
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,690
Thank you.

410
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,710
Because there's this.

411
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,010
I feel like I should be following the path a little bit.

412
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,390
Good night means out.

413
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,090
Good night.

414
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,110
This is Anakin Skywalker's least favorite game.

415
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:09,650
Truly.

416
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,210
Scan it to use code boomerang ever.

417
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,930
We'll try going here first.

418
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,370
How do I meet somebody?

419
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,790
Who's gonna play with me?

420
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,950
One lucky...

421
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:36,390

journey for so many years what is this oh

code I don't think so.

424
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,680
See the graves?

425
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,280
It was this one that I think looked like it.

426
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,830
Ooh, the sound of the rocks is nice.

427
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,050
Okay, now they tell me to go this way.

428
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,410
Is this game pretty linear?

429
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,790
Please, magic cloth.

430
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,210
I want to fly in.

431
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,010
I wish to fly.

432
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,050
Yeah?

433
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,130
Okay.

434
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,550
More magic cloth!

435
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,270
Thank you!

436
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,730
It looks so cute.

437
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,090
It does look pretty cute, no?

438
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,080
Oh, I did not jump high enough.

439
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,740
Oh geez, okay.

440
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,480
That's fine.

441
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,940
What is this?

442
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,540
Somebody listen to my song!

443
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,840
Why is it glowing?

444
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,660
Only one, too.

445
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:17,880
Mysterious.

446
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,380
There's a glowing over there, too.

447
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,400
Hmm.

448
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,300
Whoa.

449
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:25,900
Whoa.

450
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,800
I need to get in there.

451
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,980
You can hold it for a bigger area.

452
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,400
Whoa.

453
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,640
Thank you.

454
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,980
Open up.

455
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,720
Can you get me?

456
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,580
They're trapped.

457
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,740
Oh, there's some trapped in here too!

458
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,250
Oh my gosh.

459
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,910
Give me more.

460
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:56,910
Please?

461
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,790
I'm hungry.

462
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,810
Thank you.

463
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,050
Oh, they're all trapped.

464
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,930
Interesting.

465
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,510
Happy Day Saturday.

466
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,030
Happy birthday, other wisps too.

467
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,010
Hatata!

468
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,250
Happy birthday!

469
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,570
So many birthdays.

470
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,130
Come on up.

471
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,110
Oh, shoot.

472
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,310
Oh, I'm bad at it.

473
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,070
These guys are skipped.

474
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,130
When do I meet somebody else?

475
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,260
Hello.

476
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,320
Please.

477
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,400
Thank you.

478
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,640
Oh, up here, up here.

479
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,120
Hop, hop, hop, hop.

480
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,660
Hop, hop.

481
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,880
Did we learn a new one?

482
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,340
Whoa!

483
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,540
Okay?

484
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,440
Interesting.

485
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,100
Oh, whoa, whoa.

486
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,940
Oh, I ran out.

487
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,180
My scarf got longer.

488
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,760
That's what happened.

489
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,320
What's going on up here?

490
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,420
Ah!

491
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:27,800
Whoa!

492
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:28,860
Need!

493
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:34,660
Free!

494
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,040
Be free!

495
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah!

496
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,080
Give me more.

497
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,460
Woo-hoo!

498
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,340
Nice!

499
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,820
But there was one...

500
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,380
That one.

501
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,680
I want that one as well.

502
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,320
Hmm.

503
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,180
Before we do that...

504
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,740
We can always...

505
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,740
We can always...

506
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,390
Stick the landing.

507
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,170
Yes, longer, longer, longer.

508
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,390
Okay.

509
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,850
It still dies so fast, though.

510
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,760
You're a landing.

511
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,920
You're a landing.

512
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,900
Yes, they all want to touch my scarf.

513
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,140
So if I do this...

514
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,300
Oh!

515
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,700
Wee!

516
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,560
So awesome.

517
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,480
So what's this going on up here?

518
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,180
Okay.

519
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,180
Oh, oh wait, uh, one more?

520
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,720
One more?

521
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,040
It's so satisfying.

522
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,680
Oh, did we just sit down?

523
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,680
Like a little cat.

524
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,840
Our character does kind of look like a cat, no?

525
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:16,950
Hello?

526
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,480
It's a light volcano.

527
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,840
Oh.

528
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,720
The character is so cute.

529
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,980
The birds make the crops grow.

530
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,900
It's their poop.

531
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,420
And that makes the people grow.

532
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,560
And then the people get cats.

533
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,870
They build bigger trees.

534
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,440
So we must restore the birds.

535
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,300
so that we can bring back the plants and the people.

536
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,380
That's what we must do.

537
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,220
So smart.

538
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,260
I know.

539
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,340
Do you guys see that?

540
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,660
There's my partner.

541
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,520
Who are you?

542
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,680
Who are you?

543
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,800
Who are you?

544
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,060
They're running away.

545
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,040
She is an archaeologist.

546
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:52,860
player two I'm guessing I couldn't open the other stuff in
there because I just left hopefully can you make a funny

547
00:37:52,860 --> 00:38:00,980
face like that or like really funny like this

548
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:24,640
player two where are you the sounds in this game are just so
nice Okay, I see that down there.

549
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,290
Let's go get it.

550
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,580
Someone must be playing it too, right?

551
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,320
Right now?

552
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,480
You can have your chance to...

553
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,480
There they are!

554
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,670
What's happening to me?

555
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:02,990
Wow!

556
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:03,630
Oh!

557
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,550
Wow!

558
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,600
Yes, extend your...

559
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,440
Your scar.

560
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,500
Hi player two!

561
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,940
I've never played this game before, have you?

562
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,180
They said, yes, and how about you?

563
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,260
How are you today?

564
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,680
I'm good, thank you.

565
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,180
Whoa, are you glowing?

566
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,170
Are you a wisp?

567
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,030
Chirp if...

568
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:42,650
Oh.

569
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,890
Chirp if you're a wisp.

570
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,670
I can't tell

571
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,640
What is this?

572
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,220
Oh, oh, cool

573
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,480
What's happening?

574
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,440
Release them!

575
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,940
Release the birds!

576
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,880
Chirp, three chirps if you're a wisp

577
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:26,140
One, two, three, four That was four Three, if you're a
wizard.

578
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,820
That's three?

579
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,980
That's three?

580
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,240
Can't tell.

581
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,380
One, two, three.

582
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,480
That was three!

583
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,600
Nice!

584
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,300
Come on up!

585
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,970
There's also one over there.

586
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:54,690
What?

587
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,930
I guess we got to keep making them...

588
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,070
Wait.

589
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,350
Oh.

590
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,170
Uh-oh.

591
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,860
This is me laughing at you.

592
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,090
Ha.

593
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:06,710
Ha.

594
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:07,170
Ha.

595
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,270
Oh.

596
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,200
There's one over there.

597
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,090
Oh.

598
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,210
Oh.

599
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:21,270
Oh.

600
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:21,830
Oh.

601
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,310
Oh.

602
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,400
Wait, do I need...

603
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,210
There we go.

604
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,180
More birds.

605
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,790
There's this one too.

606
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,590
This one looks like it'll connect.

607
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,530
Yeah?

608
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,150
You need help?

609
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,410
Whoa, what's happening?

610
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,730
I'm releasing birds.

611
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,920
I can't count the three.

612
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,100
It's definitely one of us.

613
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,020
Don't be mean.

614
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,500
What's up?

615
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,540
Yeah?

616
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,580
What's wrong?

617
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,600
This guy?

618
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,600
Oh, you released it.

619
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Hold on, there was a big one.

620
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,220
There's actually so many here.

621
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,480
There's that big guy.

622
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,000
But I also want to extend my...

623
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,100
I want to extend my thing.

624
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,000
My scarf.

625
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,640
Am I going to be going crazy with exploring?

626
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,540
This is part of the journey, no?

627
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,240
You can...

628
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,580
Can I even extend those with the beeps too?

629
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,280
Oh, you can!

630
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,300
This way over here, yeah, yeah!

631
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,290
Let me know also if the music gets a little too loud.

632
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:05,050
I know you guys say loud, or we'll say louder or something,
but...

633
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:05,670
Mintota!

634
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,150
Good morning!

635
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,830
Me too, me too!

636
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:18,890
Nice.

637
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,650
Wait, there's still sparkle.

638
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,090
What's this sparkle for?

639
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:26,790
Hmm.

640
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,550
Mysterious.

641
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,630
Wait, so if I...

642
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,910
Whoa!

643
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:37,250
Cool!

644
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,360
Maybe just to let you know it was there.

645
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:48,740
Maybe.

646
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,140
Ayya!

647
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,470
Whoa,

648
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:03,820
whoa, whoa!

649
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,240
Nice!

650
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,840
Yeah, I was gonna say this will make a big guy.

651
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,000
Supposed to get the little pieces, too.

652
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:16,960
Little pieces?

653
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,980
The thing, the glowy bits?

654
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,420
I feel like you have to, so you can extend your...

655
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,400
Oh!

656
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,760
So you can extend your scarf.

657
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,780
Oh, I think that...

658
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,200
Did it know?

659
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,260
But there's still more to see.

660
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,660
Partner, we're not leaving yet.

661
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,020
I'm the leader of this coup.

662
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,420
Not yet.

663
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,180
We must get more birds.

664
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,320
Pronto.

665
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,560
Eyebow.

666
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,100
The journey for the longer scarf.

667
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,880
The longest scarf.

668
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,400
The top chicken.

669
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,660
Yeah, we're birds, and we're birding it up.

670
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,100
Oh, get up there.

671
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,800
Get up there.

672
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,440
Wait.

673
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,620
There we go.

674
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,060
Wait, there's something behind there!

675
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:20,800
Aibo!

676
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,100
Aibo, look!

677
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:24,480
Oh!

678
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,040
Aibo, Aibo!

679
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,750
It's lore!

680
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,490
It's lore, look!

681
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:38,910
What is that?

682
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,400
Cities, they are.

683
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,560
had cities even.

684
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,640
They were an advanced society.

685
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,260
Can you fill me up?

686
00:45:59,360 --> 00:45:59,720
Thank you.

687
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Okay.

688
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:01,840
Um.

689
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,040
There's... Oh, that one didn't open anything.

690
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,500
That, I can see it's open.

691
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:07,840
Um...

692
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,480
We have to get up there.

693
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,720
I think the best way to get that...

694
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,240
Maybe from here?

695
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,760
We'll make it.

696
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,580
Or if we go from the top.

697
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,040
I think From here, we can make it, though.

698
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:28,710
Oh, my God.

699
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,110
Ah, nice.

700
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:31,990
She's too good.

701
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:33,810
Use the boards.

702
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:34,550
Oh, I forgot.

703
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:35,950
It's fine.

704
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:36,510
We didn't need them.

705
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,250
Settling in with some homemade curry.

706
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:38,990
Ah, Choki!

707
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:41,310
Miss Consanity.

708
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,650
Thank you.

709
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,830
If I died and came back as a flying dish towel in the
desert, I'd be pretty mad.

710
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:48,570
Why?

711
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,390
I think it'd be quite relaxing.

712
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,870
No?

713
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:57,650
Just me?

714
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:06,690
Listen to the song of my people!

715
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,070
Hey!

716
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,110
Top me off!

717
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,490
Thank you?

718
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,150
Wait, they did not top me off!

719
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,250
Chatty over here!

720
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,030
Here we go!

721
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,150
Do we get everything in here, you think?

722
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,990
I don't think I see anything else.

723
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:58,950
Yeah, I did?

724
00:47:59,310 --> 00:47:59,770
Okay, glue.

725
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,940
Should be.

726
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,400
Cool!

727
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,300
Okay, I get this side.

728
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:10,820
Eyeball.

729
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,080
Good job!

730
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,160
Oh.

731
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,660
We have to sit.

732
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,560
Oh my gosh, they really look like cats.

733
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,100
Yes?

734
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,140
The great cat.

735
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:39,780
Oh my god.

736
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,620
Wait, it's kind of freaky.

737
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,800
Wait, that looks like a bird.

738
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:44,780
That's a bird.

739
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:56,650
War.

740
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,190
Then they got cats.

741
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:04,250
They built big towns.

742
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,310
Wait, that looks like the thing we just kind of made, right?

743
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,160
And trains!

744
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,580
They were so advanced!

745
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,220
It's a big bird!

746
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,960
And electricity!

747
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,480
Is it because of the scarves?

748
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,440
The little birds?

749
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,120
The fabric birds?

750
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,520
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

751
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,900
They use the cloth for power.

752
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,880
Glad you're home and happy exploring, Possum!

753
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,960
Thank you.

754
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,540
Hope to be back for the end.

755
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,300
Thank you!

756
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,220
It's my birthday today.

757
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,380
Oh my gosh, King of Tendies, happy birthday!

758
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,280
It's round of love for Mickey and Whisper that I've been
here.

759
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,450
Well, I've been here.

760
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,280
Happy birthday!

761
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,000
Wow.

762
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,960
There's something...

763
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,080
There's like a shooting star above the...

764
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,480
Above the...

765
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,120
The volcano.

766
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,120
It's pink!

767
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,920
I'll release you.

768
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:54,880
I'll release you.

769
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,200
What's that sound?

770
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:57,560
though.

771
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:06,390
Whoa!

772
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,270
Different type of bird.

773
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,570
Oh my gosh.

774
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:11,070
Cool!

775
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:19,920
No item name.

776
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,960
Thank you so much, brother.

777
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,560
That's why I got to thank you.

778
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,160
I took Peter's... I was like looking at your name like, how
do I say this?

779
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,740
How do I say this?

780
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,800
What's over here?

781
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,240
He's calling too.

782
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,560
He wants us to fall, though.

783
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:44,750
Oh.

784
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:46,910
Thank you.

785
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:49,630
They're so nice.

786
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:51,410
Oh.

787
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,270
Goodbye.

788
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,670
Where are

789
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,050
we going?

790
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:03,330
We're just following him.

791
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,810
Am I playing with a viewer or a rando?

792
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,890
We think it's a viewer, no?

793
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,330
Do a little chirp if you're a viewer.

794
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,490
I feel like that was too early.

795
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:19,350
See?

796
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,530
Oh, he wants his friend.

797
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:23,570
Release the friend.

798
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,690
I don't think randomly people are playing this game in 2025.

799
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,910
I think that's the same.

800
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:36,870
Wow!

801
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,870
I have my own magic card.

802
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:47,490
Oh, oops.

803
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:47,810
Sorry.

804
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,710
Wait, can I get back on?

805
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:49,030
Wait.

806
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:49,670
Oh, don't move.

807
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:50,190
Don't move.

808
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,610
Wait, don't move.

809
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:53,930
Wait, oh shoot.

810
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,990
Can somebody grab me?

811
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:57,290
Wait.

812
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,930
Can somebody pick me up?

813
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:01,570
Please.

814
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:02,850
Can you pick me up?

815
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:04,810
Can you pick me up?

816
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:05,230
No.

817
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:08,930
No!

818
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,330
I thought I could move.

819
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,670
My magic carpet.

820
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,030
What's in here?

821
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:25,810
Cats.

822
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:38,150
Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew
Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew,

823
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:43,210
Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew, Mew.

824
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:49,510
You were so close, you were glowing!

825
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,470
to be...

826
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,210
Yeah.

827
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:06,200
Oh, we're going this way?

828
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,270
Okay, no biggie.

829
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,670
Pick me up.

830
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:15,650
Pick me up.

831
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,390
Pick me up, please.

832
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:19,850
Come on, come on.

833
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,430
We're both struggling, me and my partner.

834
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,520
It's a sound.

835
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,420
It's so loud.

836
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,560
Come on.

837
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

838
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:46,910
Come here, hold on, birds.

839
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,150
Hold on.

840
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:48,770
Birds!

841
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:55,310
Yes.

842
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,010
Oh, I think I got it.

843
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:57,470
Nice.

844
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,190
What do you do when Minto leaves?

845
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,550
Wait for her to get back.

846
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,210
I'm back!

847
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,330
I'm back for a few days.

848
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,230
Minto flying around like a grain of sand.

849
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,170
Please, pick...

850
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,030
Please, upies!

851
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,150
Please, upies, please!

852
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,310
I guess we can constantly be jumping, though, because
they'll give us...

853
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,070
Constant, like...

854
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:33,530
They'll constantly be refreshing our...

855
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:34,850
Where are they going?

856
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:37,450
Our scarf.

857
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,450
Oh, this way.

858
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,080
No, no ABJ.

859
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,840
Unless it's A, B, J.

860
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,360
No, sorry, wait.

861
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,060
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

862
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:54,600
We're lagging.

863
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:55,880
Whoa, we're lagging.

864
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,280
A.

865
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,160
A.

866
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,260
A, B.

867
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,600
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

868
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:07,640
J.

869
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,600
You get it?

870
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,000
What are we talking about?

871
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,900
Always be jumping.

872
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,520
Always be jumping.

873
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,300
It can be abbreviated.

874
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,060
You just have to be careful about it, you know?

875
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,220
What are you doing?

876
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,080
I hear noise, but I don't know where it's from.

877
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:41,880
Where's my partner?

878
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,060
Friend?

879
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,460
Oh, oh, they want this guy out.

880
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:46,800
I see.

881
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,380
I see, I see.

882
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,540
Don't worry, I got him.

883
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,160
Oh, you can't.

884
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,720
You got him.

885
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,680
You got him.

886
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:01,990
Good job.

887
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:04,810
Good job.

888
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:07,510
What do they want now?

889
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,330
Oh wait, can we go inside?

890
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:12,870
No.

891
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:16,290
Where do they go?

892
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,230
What do they want now?

893
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,140
This away.

894
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:25,280
Time to leave.

895
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,720
Always be journeying.

896
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:27,860
Yeah!

897
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,930

going the right way wait why am I lagging so bad I changed I

923
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:04,890

graphics to high.

924
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:10,950
They were like automatically put at medium but now I'm
nervous.

925
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:17,490
Could be the network.

926
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:18,370
That's what I'm thinking.

927
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,730
It's like that kind of lag you know.

928
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:22,290
Did they go up?

929
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:26,070
Where are they going?

930
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,570
Seems to be the case.

931
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,410
Around here?

932
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,130

Oh, wait.

941
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,700
Is that a bad guy, or...

942
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,120
Oh, it's like a machine.

943
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:08,600
Whoa.

944
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,900
A little bit spoopy now.

945
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:12,980
You okay?

946
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:13,500
Don't fall.

947
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,860
Whoa, it's making me.

948
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,810
Oh, it's freaky.

949
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:25,250
Whoa.

950
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,590
There's so many trapped in there.

951
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,170
We'll set you free.

952
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:33,430
Right over here.

953
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,230
Are you gonna help us up?

954
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:37,730
Help me up.

955
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:40,790

Thank you.

957
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:48,690
Let's go, eyeball.

958
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:49,690
Hi, me.

959
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:50,370
Hello!

960
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:52,190

962
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:01,980
Did we get it?

963
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:03,680
Yeah.

964
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,640
My wife missed you!

965
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,340
We're both very excited about density.exe.

966
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,880
Also, the Minto Pansu didn't fit one of...

967
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,040
I see.

968
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:17,640
Scarfens.

969
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,360
They're scarfing it down.

970
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:27,760
...

971
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,080
...

972
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:28,200
...

973
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,220
Yeah, we want to do lots of covers together.

974
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,610
Oh, more.

975
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,210
Bigger cities.

976
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:44,710
More, taller.

977
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,530
Wait, are these all like power?

978
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,250
Basically, they're not houses, they're like...

979
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,210
Energy, they're like...

980
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,290
Energy centers, kind of.

981
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,190
Whoa, or maybe?

982
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:03,700
Be free!

983
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:11,920
They do kind of remind me of like, yeah, like dolphins or
whales or something.

984
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:13,040
Power plants!

985
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,660
Yeah, that's the word that I was thinking of.

986
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,300
They're waiting for us, eyeball.

987
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,780
There's two that are waiting for us.

988
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:31,480
Whoa.

989
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,000
Wow!

990
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:44,860
Pink.

991
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:57,910
I'm zooming.

992
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,470
Watch this sick flip.

993
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:09,370
Whoa, dang it, I dropped too.

994
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,770
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

995
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:15,090
Yes.

996
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:29,220
Wee!

997
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,300
She's gaming.

998
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,110
I'll land right.

999
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,580
Did something.

1000
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,620
Oh, released more.

1001
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:08,480
Good job!

1002
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:09,080
Good job!

1003
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,700
What else we got going on?

1004
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,180
Is this a thing?

1005
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,880
This looks like a thing.

1006
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:34,510
Good job!

1007
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,350
Good job, Ibu!

1008
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:39,870
Wait, there's like some guys over here.

1009
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:46,490
You could see me in the corner leaving, this cousin?

1010
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:52,270
Yay!

1011
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:02,380
Okay, hold on, there were guys over here.

1012
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:07,040
Now that I know that there's sometimes like secrets, it
makes me wonder, you know?

1013
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,000
What could be up here?

1014
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:12,960
Aha!

1015
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:17,890
And the Sedge.

1016
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:22,890
More lore!

1017
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:30,130
Hey, Aibol.

1018
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,090
They're just more cats in cities.

1019
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:35,570
Cats in boxes.

1020
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:40,230
So now we got...

1021
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,170
Do you see that up there?

1022
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:42,510
Aibol!

1023
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:45,070
Aibol, there's another thing!

1024
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,730
She said, yes, I do.

1025
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:51,790
I do see it.

1026
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,050
Great dominto, sama.

1027
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,770
I'm having cheesecake for Thanksgiving.

1028
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:56,850
Can't decide what flavor.

1029
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:57,350
Oreo?

1030
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:58,170
Oreo.

1031
01:06:58,550 --> 01:06:58,850
Oreo.

1032
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:00,870
Wait, how do we get up there?

1033
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:03,310
Here?

1034
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:04,630
Right here?

1035
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:06,550
Okay.

1036
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:08,150
I'm watching you.

1037
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:10,610
Ah, go get it!

1038
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,870
Go get your dreams!

1039
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:18,330
Wait, am I

1040
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:25,600
gonna make it?

1041
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:26,300
Wait, eyeball.

1042
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,200
Eyeball, I don't know if I'm gonna make it.

1043
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:28,720
Eyeball!

1044
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:29,700
I made it.

1045
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,160
Just kidding.

1046
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,520
I made it!

1047
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,380
I'm guessing that probably was...

1048
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,700
Oh my gosh, it's so smoky.

1049
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,400
That probably was like the only secret in this area.

1050
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,680
We got everything else, I think.

1051
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,820
So we can continue onwards.

1052
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:47,240
You ready?

1053
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:48,700

01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:12,940
Oh no!

1105
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,680
They fought over it.

1106
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:16,120
No!

1107
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,290
Let's go, Eibor.

1108
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,600
Into the abyss.

1109
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,080
I want to hear Mint say the phrase.

1110
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:43,740
War.

1111
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,820
War has changed.

1112
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:48,920
That?

1113
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,480
Wow.

1114
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,020
The sand is so shiny.

1115
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,620
Look at the kick up more sand.

1116
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:07,480
New day.

1117
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:08,620
Kick it up.

1118
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,440
Kick up...

1119
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,020
Kick up the sand.

1120
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,580
Yeah, kick up that sand.

1121
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,460
Porker is cooking now to watch OC.

1122
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,140
Yummy!

1123
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,780
What are these?

1124
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,760
These look special.

1125
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:36,490
Just a rack.

1126
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:42,680
Oh, okay.

1127
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,380
Oh, there are some...

1128
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,680
scarf dolphins down here.

1129
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:50,640
Oh!

1130
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,000
It looks like we're at the bottom of the ocean, no?

1131
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:06,750
Whoa!

1132
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:10,350
Are these the trains?

1133
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:11,830
They look like it now, right?

1134
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:13,990
Is there anything in here?

1135
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:16,130
You check out that one, I boy.

1136
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:16,910
Check out this one.

1137
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:18,490
Call if you need help.

1138
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:22,450
Oh!

1139
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:22,990
Oh!

1140
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:23,710
In here!

1141
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:24,950
In here, in here!

1142
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:34,600
Get your thing.

1143
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:39,500
You're welcome.

1144
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,380
I don't know what they were saying.

1145
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,860
I don't really understand their accent.

1146
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,040
Thank you.

1147
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:50,420
Mint.

1148
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,340
That's what they said.

1149
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,240
Whoa, wow!

1150
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,020
Okay, so it's meant to look like the bottom of the ocean.

1151
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:00,800
Because look at that.

1152
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:02,220
Wow!

1153
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:03,340
Whoa.

1154
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:07,800
Whoa!

1155
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:09,760
Wait.

1156
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,060
There's one in here.

1157
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,800
Now you are Kelp.

1158
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,320
Jeffrey, hi!

1159
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:27,880
Yep.

1160
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,280
I got it too.

1161
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,340
Wait, is there one down here?

1162
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:30,980
Is that one?

1163
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:33,300
No.

1164
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,040
My eyes do deceive me.

1165
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,840
Kelp.

1166
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,420
Minto is cute.

1167
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,280
I want to know who's playing with me.

1168
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,140
I want to see them in chat.

1169
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:50,740
Is it?

1170
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,240
Where are you?

1171
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:56,040
Wait, oh, I don't think I'll make it.

1172
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:57,920
Oh, oh.

1173
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:08,800
Oh, wait.

1174
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:09,920
It did help, actually.

1175
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:14,660
Wait.

1176
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:19,660
This the way?

1177
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:22,020
Oh, there's my abbo.

1178
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,460
You were in the calp.

1179
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:25,640
What are you doing in there?

1180
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,950
They will show their name after the credits.

1181
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:32,390
Really?

1182
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,530
Wait, are you still in here?

1183
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:35,730
Oh, you're gone.

1184
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:37,030
Hello.

1185
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,100
Unless you were talking in chat.

1186
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:49,520
Hold on, I'm making sure there's nothing in there.

1187
01:17:59,190 --> 01:17:59,670
Jellies.

1188
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:01,550
Jellies!

1189
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,900
Jelly, jelly, jelly.

1190
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1191
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:20,030
There's one up here.

1192
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:25,590
Nice.

1193
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:27,310
Good job to him.

1194
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:35,460
Wow.

1195
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,340
It's so beautiful.

1196
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:41,260
It's so pretty, it makes me mad.

1197
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,580
Oh, there's nothing up here, I think.

1198
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:44,580
On this?

1199
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,420
No, it doesn't seem like it.

1200
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,140
Oh.

1201
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,900
We're going down!

1202
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:52,200
Oh!

1203
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,000
Ouch.

1204
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:58,310
You see anything over here?

1205
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,430
No, it doesn't look like it.

1206
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:02,830
Sorry, Eye Boy.

1207
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,610
I love exploring too much.

1208
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:10,860
It's okay, Minto!

1209
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,340
That's what they said.

1210
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,500
Nothing here.

1211
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,660
This is spooky.

1212
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,840
This is quite spooky.

1213
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,480
Are there bosses in this game?

1214
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,700
How do you even fight?

1215
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,040
Yeah?

1216
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:52,040
Oh my gosh.

1217
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,060
Um, okay, I spoke.

1218
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:00,340
Did I die?

1219
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:01,320
You know?

1220
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:05,440
So loud.

1221
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:08,700
Ah!

1222
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:09,520
Ah!

1223
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,100
That spooked a heckie out of me.

1224
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,940
Okay, did we keep going?

1225
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:24,900
It was so loud.

1226
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,960
Watch out for those.

1227
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,380
I think

1228
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,620
you lost Scarf.

1229
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:38,500
Did I?

1230
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:39,600
No.

1231
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:54,660
They damage your scarf permanently.

1232
01:20:57,980 --> 01:20:58,360
Uh-oh.

1233
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,920
Wait, is this a stealth mission?

1234
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:00,840
Oh my gosh.

1235
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,440
Eyebo, I'm scared.

1236
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,460
Eyebo, Eyebo, I'm scared.

1237
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,630
Hey, we were going after that.

1238
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,450
Is this now a sneaking mission?

1239
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,210
Oh my gosh.

1240
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,080
Oh my god, the music is all scary all of a sudden.

1241
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:28,360
Eyebo!

1242
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,080
I'm scared!

1243
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,140
We should get higher up ground?

1244
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,340
So that if we need to slide, we can slide.

1245
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:38,060
You see my vision?

1246
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,880
Wait, did we get up here?

1247
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,600
Or anything?

1248
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,380
And my scarf looks so short now, so sad.

1249
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:03,670
Oh my god.

1250
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:09,440
He's scanning.

1251
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:14,150
Ah!

1252
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:14,590
Sorry.

1253
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:15,650
Oh my god, this is...

1254
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:21,090
That's an alive one!

1255
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:23,470
Good to know.

1256
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:26,210
Oh my gosh.

1257
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,550
Eyeball, I'm scared.

1258
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,190
Eyeball, I didn't know this was going to be a horror game.

1259
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:34,330
Eyeball.

1260
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:38,190
Eyeball, I'm scared.

1261
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:44,540
What if we die?

1262
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:53,940
Okay.

1263
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,220
That's one.

1264
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:55,680

Okay.

Alright, we're good.

01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,740
There's one over there, isn't there?

1279
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:16,900
I see it, I see it.

1280
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,360
Nice.

1281
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:36,410
Such a good eyeball, yeah.

1282
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:44,630
I saw him with his eye, but I don't...

1283
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:46,930
Oh, I see orange over there.

1284
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:47,970
Okay.

1285
01:24:50,690 --> 01:24:52,690
Like I saw, I had seen a blue light, you know.

1286
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:54,850
Oh my gosh, wait.

1287

This one's gonna come alive, isn't it?

1288
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:57,530

01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,600
Bird person.

01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,640
Oh my gosh, is that why the mountain is split?

1308
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:45,710
Oh, they're all dead!

01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:49,230
One or the other.

1311
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:54,070
Mountains and mountains of graves.

1312
01:26:58,530 --> 01:26:59,510
It looks nighttime.

1313
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:02,530
It could be that they're not, they're, you know, they sleep
at night.

1314
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:06,050
Oh, they become stars in the sky!

01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:19,690
Sleeping under the sand.

1318
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:21,670
They're hibernating.

1319
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,940
Let's go, Aibo.

1320
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,500

01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,840
The gravestones.

1325
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,820
So these were gravestones.

1326
01:27:57,530 --> 01:28:00,030

1333
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,080

Me!

1342
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:34,720
And the graves.

1343
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:35,280
Whoa!

1344
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:36,280

Whoa!

1349
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:00,460
Interesting.

1350
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:01,960
What do you see?

1351
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,480
I see it!

1352
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,020
Oh, oops.

1353
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:06,140
I fell in the water.

1354
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:11,460
Thank you!

1355
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:16,610
Is there anything...

1356
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:20,330
Let's go to this one.

1357
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:33,350
In here, maybe?

1358
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:37,050
If I...

1359
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:38,310
If I yell really loud?

1360
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:41,310
Okay, nothing happens.

1361
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:43,750
Oh, over there.

1362
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:44,410
Maybe.

1363
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:47,570
Okay.

1364
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:50,290
Hold on, I'm gonna replenish here.

1365
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:52,430
Thank you.

1366
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:00,490
Good job, Ibu.

1367
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,020
There's eyes!

1368
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,240
That's eyes!

1369
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:09,100
That's eyes!

1370
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,180
The water.

1371
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:13,340
The jellyfish!

1372
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,520
Oh, oh, the critters.

1373
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:19,740
I kept saying birds, but they're fish.

1374
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,880
I called them birds.

1375
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:25,700
But they're fish.

1376
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:27,820
They're all little fish.

1377
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,220
Look at these, even these guys, they're not tiny cloth
birds.

1378
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,720
They're fish.

1379
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,500
Wait, was anything in here?

1380
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,980
Oh, it's so beautiful.

1381
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:51,540
They evolved or devolved, depending.

1382
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,040
We're going high, we're going up.

1383
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,800
Oh, no, no, no, no!

1384
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:09,250
Where are you?

1385
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:15,790
Where is it?

1386
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:17,880
Where are you?

1387
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,360
Where are you, Aibu?

1388
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,020
Over there.

1389
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:23,220
Oh gosh.

1390
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:23,660
Eh.

1391
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,980
Oh, oh, I see you.

1392
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:27,800
Thank you.

1393
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:30,200
I'm blind.

1394
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:37,710
Thank you.

1395
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:39,430
Good eyeball.

1396
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:43,730
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you.

1397
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:47,030
Okay.

1398
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:54,340
Where are you going?

1399
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:56,280
I'm going up.

1400
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,220
We're going up.

1401
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,080
Oh, help me.

1402
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,200
I made it somehow.

1403
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:09,660
Oh, good job.

1404
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:10,360
Hello.

1405
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,920
Where do we go from here?

1406
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:15,660
I'm trying to find...

1407
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:16,580
Oh, up there, up there.

1408
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:27,780
Nice.

1409
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,520
Follow the scarf animal.

1410
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,580
That's us.

1411
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,480
Oh, that's me.

1412
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:39,640
I'm blocking the cutscene.

1413
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:46,610
Whoa, whoa, big animal!

1414
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:50,550
Good thing they're friends.

1415
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:51,130
Oh my god.

1416
01:33:57,630 --> 01:33:58,110
Whoa.

1417
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,420
Wait, what's down there?

1418
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:10,260
Did we already...

1419
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,840
Oh, these are the things that we already did.

1420
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,040
I'm coming.

1421
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:14,740
I'm coming.

1422
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:18,210
I'll get in there.

1423
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:19,070
Oh gosh.

1424
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:19,950
good?

1425
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,130
Oh, I'm good.

1426
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:21,630
I'm fine.

1427
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:26,290
So cool.

1428
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:28,710
Gosh, our scarves are going to be so long.

1429
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:30,790
Where'd that guy go?

1430
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:33,430
Yeah, those are the things that we already unlocked.

1431
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:37,430
Come on, buddy.

1432
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:48,280
Did you make it?

1433
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:49,940
Yeah?

1434
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:50,400
Okay.

1435
01:34:57,970 --> 01:34:59,770
We made some stairs.

1436
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:04,790
There it is!

1437
01:35:04,890 --> 01:35:05,570
Our stairs!

1438
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,240
What do you see?

1439
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,340
Over here?

1440
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:21,620
What?

1441
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,180
Oh, there's another one!

1442
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,080
No, we already did this one, though.

1443
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,920
Yeah, how are they able to know that we're doing this stuff?

1444
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,340
Do they see the future?

1445
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:43,080
I'm not sure.

1446
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,480
I like how we float every time we get on these.

1447
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:49,020
It's cool.

1448
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:54,320
Yes, more, more.

1449
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,620
Mine and craft.

1450
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,120
The prophecy.

1451
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:03,030
Yeah, that would make sense, huh?

1452
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:03,370
Oh.

1453
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:08,630
Wow.

1454
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:11,190
I love the fish.

1455
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:13,890
I want Scarfish.

1456
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:21,150
Okay.

1457
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:26,300
Do it.

1458
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:37,480
And then we go downstairs and there's fireworks!

1459
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:42,280
Is it going to keep rising?

1460
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:52,190
I love energy water.

1461
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:56,090
This is how you feel drinking five...

1462
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:56,570
Wait.

1463
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:58,450
That's the gum.

1464
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:02,290
Did we see all the...

1465
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:03,250
Did we see the...

1466
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,030
Oh, they're...

1467
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:06,370
They're all like lighting up here.

1468
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:07,330
Oh, see?

1469
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:07,630
See?

1470
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:08,850
Like that?

1471
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:13,840
Cool!

1472
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,840
Me when I drink five gum.

1473
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,840
I don't know how many pieces of gum are in my tummy.

1474
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,300
Hopefully not so many.

1475
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:56,770
Apparently swallowing gum isn't bad.

1476
01:37:58,950 --> 01:37:59,230
Mama!

1477
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:09,300
Yes, I did this!

1478
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,580
I did this!

1479
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,560
This is my journey!

1480
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:19,200
I crossed the deserts and I made the bridges and I hopped.

1481
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:22,540
And I saw the buildings.

1482
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,780
And I ran down the stairs.

1483
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,240
I went underground.

1484
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:29,560
And I...

1485
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:30,440
That was scary.

1486
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,340
I don't want to go back there.

1487
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:34,940
Oh, now we're going to crawl.

1488
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:38,940
We're going to crawl through the wind.

1489
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,700
Up to the top, top, tippy-top mountain.

1490
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:47,150
You and Ible.

1491
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:47,910
Yeah.

1492
01:38:49,550 --> 01:38:51,670
There was at least one roll of bubble tape in my belly.

1493
01:38:55,450 --> 01:38:57,590
We gotta crawl, we gotta crawl!

1494
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:05,690
We can reach the lips of the mountain and give it a big ol'
smooch.

1495
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:09,610
Crawling in my crawl.

1496
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:12,450
Celeste time?

1497
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:13,250
Oh geez.

1498
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:16,150
Suddenly it turned into a seven hour stream.

1499
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:23,680
Let's go eyeball.

1500
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,660
Are you ready to crawl?

1501
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:28,420
Are you ready to crawl?

1502
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:30,160
Are you ready to crawl?

1503
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:32,640
Yes or no?

1504
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:37,000
They said, yes, I'm ready to crawl, Minto.

1505
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:39,460
That's what they said.

1506
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,000
Is there anything up here?

1507
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:49,300
Am I being two?

1508
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:54,920
The snow!

1509
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:01,780
I thought I had a dirty mind and then he said the same
thing.

1510
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:02,520
Dirty!

1511
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:14,740
Is kissing dirty?

1512
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:22,040
Her song has changed once again.

1513
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:29,520
Oh, thank you!

1514
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:36,700
Oh, wow, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah.

1515
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:41,100
Do these activate?

1516
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,300
Oh, they do!

1517
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,960
It's so snowy here.

1518
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,490
Oh, there's red guys too.

1519
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,200
Wait, is that a bad guy?

1520
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:00,800
He's nice now, right?

1521
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:02,420
Yes?

1522
01:41:12,450 --> 01:41:15,270
Why does this game feel almost like playing Peek?

1523
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:21,590
You go through all the different areas and...

1524
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:33,330
Oh, we're crawling.

1525
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:35,270
Oh, we're crawling.

1526
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:36,870
Oh, yeah.

1527
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:41,030
Okay, nice.

1528
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:43,770
Successfully crawled.

1529
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:52,170
Okay, all right.

1530
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:53,150
Oh, no!

1531
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:54,010
Ah!

1532
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:55,410
Don't fly, Aibo!

1533
01:41:55,570 --> 01:41:56,250
Don't fly!

1534
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:58,110
Ah!

1535
01:42:00,530 --> 01:42:01,570
Aibo, don't fly.

1536
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:12,090
I think you have to wait behind a rock when it comes, right?

1537
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:13,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1538
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:14,250
I was just thinking the same thing.

1539
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:16,250
Oh, don't kick me out, though.

1540
01:42:16,490 --> 01:42:16,930
Gosh.

1541
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:22,550
Why is the sand or the snow rumbling like that?

1542
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:25,970
Let's get over to the next one.

1543
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:29,190
The sky right here.

1544
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,240
I think it can take cover behind the pillars.

1545
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1546
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,860
It's not like Titanic where only one person can...

1547
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:46,240
Can get under there, you know?

1548
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,260
Or on top of there, I guess.

1549
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:53,600
Run, run, run!

1550
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:58,060
I will be careful.

1551
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:03,680
Don't be Rose, I will.

1552
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:05,620
I'll never let go!

1553
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,440
Can we just go through?

1554
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:09,340
You think?

1555
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:12,380
Yeah.

1556
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,080
Oh no, now they're tinier.

1557
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:19,520
Unless?

1558
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,440
You are so chatty.

1559
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:23,840
What's going on?

1560
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,360
I'll never let go of Jack.

1561
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:28,300
Let's go.

1562
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:28,920
Wait.

1563
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,540
Oh, that's a plant.

1564
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:33,300
Wait.

1565
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:34,620
Are you okay?

1566
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:35,500
Are you cold?

1567
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,700
Yeah, it's so cold up here.

1568
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:44,500
Don't worry.

1569
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:50,490
Okay.

1570
01:43:50,510 --> 01:43:51,470
My...

1571
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:55,930
My controller is like buzzing like crazy.

1572
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:58,510
If you like Journey, you might...

1573
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:00,350
Ooh, what was that?

1574
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:02,010
You might like the game...

1575
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:03,950
Ju-san.

1576
01:44:05,070 --> 01:44:09,010
It seems like you're like Journey, but Journey into...

1577
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:10,790
Buzz Buzz 18, but...

1578
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:11,350
Thank you!

1579
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:12,790
Oh, no bad guy!

1580
01:44:17,130 --> 01:44:19,030
Why doesn't he like us?

1581
01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:22,270
Why doesn't he like us?

1582
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:27,210
Oh, you have to, like, keep doing this, or else your scarf
will freeze over.

1583
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:30,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1584
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:36,750
I think we're having some connection issues once again.

1585
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:38,690
Oh, my gosh.

1586
01:44:38,910 --> 01:44:40,230
Really struggling here.

1587
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:45,290
It's Journey, but Celeste.

1588
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:46,310
Oh, I see.

1589
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:47,990
I see, I see.

1590
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:49,110
Come on.

1591
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:50,030
Come on.

1592
01:44:50,170 --> 01:44:50,670
Keep going.

1593
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:52,230
Come on.

1594
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:55,890
We're gonna make it.

1595
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:56,130
We're gonna make it.

1596
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:57,110
I'm gonna make it eyeball!

1597
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:01,310
What's in here real quick?

1598
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:04,270
Maybe we could warm this place up a little bit.

1599
01:45:05,790 --> 01:45:06,390
Place Celeste?

1600
01:45:06,570 --> 01:45:09,570
Honestly, I want to, but I know it's so difficult.

1601
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:13,270
Yeah!

1602
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:18,990
The birds are back!

1603
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:20,170
The sun is shining!

1604
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:25,090
Oh wait, is there anything up here?

1605
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:33,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, uh-huh.

1606
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:38,340
If there are birds, there is a secret.

1607
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:44,120
Look at them staring at each other.

1608
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,120
Wow.

1609
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:48,660
Romeo and Juliet.

1610
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,640
Celeste is not really that hard.

1611
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,260
I've heard it's pretty difficult.

1612
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:56,300
But I guess if you're good at platformers, then, you know,
it would be.

1613
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:57,860
It would be a breeze.

1614
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,360
I'm not super used to platformers, personally.

1615
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:03,320
Personally, but...

1616
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:03,740
You ready?

1617
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:05,640
Wait, there's more?

1618
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,280
Didn't look like it.

1619
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:19,920
No?

1620
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:20,480
Okay.

1621
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:26,080
Okay.

1622
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:29,360
Alright, onwards.

1623
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,140
Nice and refreshed.

1624
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:32,720
Nice and warm.

1625
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:35,820
My toes are toasty.

1626
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,280
Requires fast reaction.

1627
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:40,980
Celeste does.

1628
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,640
I see, I see.

1629
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,200
Defrost!

1630
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:52,520
Defrost!

1631
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:54,740
Defrost!

1632
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:57,420
Defrost!

1633
01:46:58,340 --> 01:46:59,420
I'm gonna go on it.

1634
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:00,760
Defrost!

1635
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,540
Defrost!

1636
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:05,940
Defrost!

1637
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,820
Defrost!

1638
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:10,220
Defrost!

1639
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:11,360
Okay.

1640
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:21,330
Huddle for warmth.

1641
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:23,150
Should we take our clothes off?

1642
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:35,890
so it's skin-to-skin contact that'll probably be the most
effective way you know I learned that and love Hina

1643
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:50,570
um are we in trouble eyeball eyeball don't fly

1644
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:58,850
eyeball are we in trouble

1645
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:08,350
oh why is your scarf my scarf doesn't it doesn't freeze up
so quickly like yours does.

1646
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:10,570
Maybe it does.

1647
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:11,330
Oh my gosh.

1648
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:18,570
Oh, oh, oh, oh, how did I get on top?

1649
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:20,850
I did not mean to do that.

1650
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,580
Do you even have skin under the cloth at this game?

1651
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:37,820
Oh, in this game, I thought you meant like, I was going to
be like, well, you know, I'm all ectoplasm, but I guess it

1652
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:42,020
might feel like skin a little Oh my gosh.

1653
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:42,680
Is that me?

1654
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,660
Oh, my head's poking out.

1655
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:46,480
I think we can make it.

1656
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:50,040
I can't make it!

1657
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:51,480
I made it.

1658
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,300
I'm not gonna make it.

1659
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:55,400
I'm not gonna make it.

1660
01:48:56,060 --> 01:48:57,580
I made it.

1661
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:01,820
Scarf and Mito slippers stays on.

1662
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:03,980
Look at back, Mito.

1663
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:04,600
Thank you.

1664
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,300
Where'd he go?

1665
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,940
Oh, where is he?

1666
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:16,040
To the next thing.

1667
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,920
What's that over there?

1668
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:28,120
This guy's a pain in my butt.

1669
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:30,920
Do do

1670
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:37,590
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

1671
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,600
It didn't open anything.

1672
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:44,440
Wait, I'm scared.

1673
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:45,220
Okay, there he is.

1674
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,240
Okay, I think we just got to go for it, eyeball.

1675
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:52,000
Do we go over there?

1676
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:52,740
Ah!

1677
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:53,880
Ah!

1678
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:01,230
My scarf is running so low!

1679
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:06,280
Ah, warmth.

1680
01:50:09,890 --> 01:50:11,910
Are we, uh, I think we're okay, maybe?

1681
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:15,030
He's not actively searching, I think we're okay.

1682
01:50:16,130 --> 01:50:17,810
What is that over there though?

1683
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:22,190
Aibo, I want to go!

1684
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:29,810
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, wait, uh, oh shoot.

1685
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:31,350
Aibo, I'm scared.

1686
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:34,380
Aibo, Aibo, did we go the other way?

1687
01:50:37,770 --> 01:50:40,450
Aibo, Aibo, Aibo, Aibo!

1688
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:43,370
Aibo!

1689
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:46,290
Secret is that way.

1690
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:47,970
Oh, I see.

1691
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:49,510
Should we try?

1692
01:50:55,370 --> 01:50:56,030
Are

1693
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,380
we going to get caught?

1694
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,160
Yay!

1695
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,480
Secrets are worth it?

1696
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:09,840
Aibo!

1697
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:12,740
Aibo, let's go to the secret!

1698
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:15,200
I want to see it!

1699
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:21,550
Yeah,

1700
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:29,560
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1701
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:30,780
What is this?

1702
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:33,440
Keep going.

1703
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,120
Aibo!

1704
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:50,440
We're both screaming together Push, push, push, push, push,
push, push, push.

1705
01:51:56,820 --> 01:51:57,960
Yes, nice.

1706
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,380
Wait, it even has a second exit, so that's good.

1707
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,060
Hello?

1708
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:05,080
Wow!

1709
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:08,040
Cave.

1710
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,440
They all went to the mountain.

1711
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:19,430
They went to the mountain.

1712
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:24,060
What could be there?

1713
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:27,180
Like a pilgrimage.

1714
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,920
Like a journey.

1715
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,740
When I think, when I'm back, either when I'm back from Japan
or in Japan, I think I'm going to play Myst.

1716
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:43,300
I wanted to honestly play it this week, but I only picked
games that I could, like, beat in one sitting.

1717
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:48,500
So that I wasn't having anything.

1718
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,020
Oops, oops.

1719
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,900
Having anything that I didn't already have finished.

1720
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:58,160
before I left, you know.

1721
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,040
Where is that guy?

1722
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:07,220
Oh, there he is.

1723
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:09,060
Oh, I don't think he's active.

1724
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,580
Oh, I was going to say I don't think he's actively
searching.

1725
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:12,960
But he might be now.

1726
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:13,820
Oh!

1727
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:24,450
Maybe we're okay.

1728
01:53:25,210 --> 01:53:26,150
Hello, we're okay.

1729
01:53:26,310 --> 01:53:26,910
I'm scared.

1730
01:53:28,750 --> 01:53:30,490
Don't know anything about Mist myself.

1731
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:35,190
I only remember attempting to play it as a wee ghost.

1732
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,750
And...

1733
01:53:36,770 --> 01:53:38,890
um failing

1734
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:45,770
we are going the right way still though right

1735
01:53:53,090 --> 01:53:55,050
the music is so intense

1736
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:18,320
there's a i don't think he's searching actively right now oh
yeah let's go to this one over here oh god uh oh uh oh uh oh

Eyeball?

1739
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,180
How did he see you?

1740
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:27,320
I guess he is active.

1741
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:30,060
How did he... How did that...

1742
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:30,260
Ah!

1743
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:35,380
Holy...

1744
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:36,120
Cow!

1745
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:38,040
What the heck just happened?

1746
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:41,380
Eyeball!

1747
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:53,900
Eyeball, don't die on me!

1748
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:57,240
Eyeball!

1749
01:54:58,900 --> 01:54:59,900
Where are you?

1750
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:02,980
Oh, you're right next to me, okay.

1751
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:15,360

01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:29,320
a break for it, I think we have to, well, let's try to, and
get to this one?

1754
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:29,940
Maybe?

1755
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:35,080
Running, running, running, running, running, running,
running, running.

1756
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:39,800
Inside, inside, inside.

1757
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:40,460
Okay.

1758
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:43,800
Aibu!

1759
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:44,700
Aibu!

1760
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:45,120
Aibu!

1761
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:49,570
Okay.

1762
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:53,450
Alright.

1763
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:56,330
Jurassic Park theme would also fit this moment.

1764
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:56,710
Go!

1765
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:57,070
Aibu!

1766
01:55:57,370 --> 01:55:57,410
Go!

1767
01:55:58,190 --> 01:56:01,310
I watched the new Jurassic world.

1768
01:56:03,710 --> 01:56:04,530
collatuses in it.

1769
01:56:04,610 --> 01:56:06,310
I was very happy about that.

1770
01:56:10,390 --> 01:56:12,330
But, well, I didn't dislike it.

1771
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:13,570
I thought it was fine still.

1772
01:56:13,790 --> 01:56:14,190
What is it?

1773
01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:15,150
Rebirth or?

1774
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:22,070
I thought it was fine.

1775
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:31,520
The gravestones.

1776
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,100
Surprise I made another one.

1777
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:44,500
I only watched it because Chris Pratt was not in it.

1778
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:49,430
I watched it because he wasn't in it.

1779
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:56,400
It's now like they're like mutant...

1780
01:56:58,180 --> 01:56:59,660
Mutant, uh...

1781
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:01,140
Dinosaur or something?

1782
01:57:06,340 --> 01:57:06,960
Whoa.

1783
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:08,840
Whoa.

1784
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:14,540
As soon as we defrost them, they freeze back up.

1785
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:24,940
No, defrost!

1786
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:25,780

Okay.

01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:06,920

Why do you hate the guy who's gonna play you in the Phantom
Movie?

01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:16,960
Don't say it!

1794
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:20,520
Everybody knows Jack Black will play me.

1795
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:26,700
Ooh, breezy!

1796
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:29,300
Watch out!

1797
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:31,680
Don't get swept away now.

1798
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,520
Anything over here?

1799
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:34,940
No.

1800
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:38,200
You don't have to follow me, Aibo.

1801
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:39,620
I'm just looking.

1802
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:47,630
Wee!

1803
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:50,950
Hold your ground!

1804
01:58:51,770 --> 01:58:53,210
Stay strong!

1805
01:58:53,970 --> 01:58:55,590
Hold your ground, hold your ground.

1806
01:58:58,770 --> 01:58:59,430
Oh my gosh.

1807
01:59:00,330 --> 01:59:00,630

1808
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:01,110
Oh my gosh!

1809
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:06,950
Hold your ground.

1810
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:09,310
Run, run, run, run.

1811
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:10,990
Run, run, run, run!

1812
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:11,590
Ah!

1813
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:14,330

1815
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:18,110
Hold!

1816
01:59:18,110 --> 01:59:18,630
Hold!

1817
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:19,130
Hold!

1818
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:21,650
Maybe we can make it to the next ledge.

1819
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:22,330

01:59:22,450 --> 01:59:24,190

01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:37,720
We're fine.

1825
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:38,220
We're not fine.

1826
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:38,900
Everything's bad.

1827
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:41,240

1828
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:42,380

02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,100
I feel like that has to happen Maybe?

1834
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:23,800
Ah Oh, I went into the snow.

1835
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:41,560
Oh.

1836
02:00:42,660 --> 02:00:43,000
Oh.

1837
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:44,960
Wait, where are we?

1838
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,000
Oh, okay.

1839
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:50,360
Yeah, our scarf is so small now.

1840
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:53,520
What happened to it?

1841
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:57,260
Does it keep getting blown away?

1842
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:57,920
Oh, whoa.

1843
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:00,920
Oh, my gosh.

1844
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:01,460
Just go.

1845
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:02,140
I will go.

1846
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:02,620
Go.

1847
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:03,760
It's cold.

1848
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:06,000
It keeps breaking off.

1849
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:06,540
Is that what?

1850
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:15,020
Oh my gosh, our scarves are so small now.

1851
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:18,240
Oh, no, no, we have to make it.

1852
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:20,400
And there's a bad guy.

1853
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,680
Oh my gosh, big baddie.

1854
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:26,000
Oh, I can

1855
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:31,840
do a sing.

1856
02:01:34,140 --> 02:01:35,060
Push, push, push.

1857
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:41,120
Push, push, push.

1858
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:51,560
The mountain looks so far away, though.

1859
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,720
The peak looks so far away.

1860
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:55,860
Oh my gosh.

1861
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:58,540
Huddle close, huddle close.

1862
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:11,520
Oh my gosh, there's so many...

1863
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,560
How did they put the gravestones up here?

1864
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:16,920
We've come so far.

1865
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,300
We can't freeze over now.

1866
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:19,800
We can't.

1867
02:02:27,870 --> 02:02:28,850
We're slow.

1868
02:02:28,930 --> 02:02:30,810
We're getting slower, I think.

1869
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:35,630
No, no, no, no, we're getting slower.

1870
02:02:37,110 --> 02:02:38,970
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1871
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,400
No, no, no, just keep...

1872
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,620
I'm pushing as hard as I can.

1873
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:51,660
You can't even hear my voice anymore!

1874
02:02:53,660 --> 02:02:55,740
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

1875
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:57,840
Oh my gosh, we're almost there.

1876
02:02:58,120 --> 02:02:59,460
Wait, the top of the mountain is gone.

1877
02:02:59,600 --> 02:02:59,980
Are we here?

1878
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:01,020
Wait, where are we?

1879
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:02,320
Oh my god, no.

1880
02:03:02,980 --> 02:03:05,880
This is like actually going up to Everest.

1881
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:09,380
We gotta start taking our clothes off.

1882
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:14,900
No!

1883
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:17,420
No!

1884
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:26,410
No, don't stop.

1885
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:27,650
Don't stop moving, Eibol.

1886
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:30,290
Sorry, my head is blocking Eibol.

1887
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:05,330
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1888
02:04:10,770 --> 02:04:12,870
Is that my ancestors question mark?

1889
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:17,050
They're judging me.

1890
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:18,530
They say even you failed.

1891
02:04:19,150 --> 02:04:21,350
You were supposed to be the prophesized one.

1892
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:28,960
Save me, bird woman.

1893
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:34,700
Oh!

1894
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:37,800
Yes!

1895
02:04:53,390 --> 02:04:54,730
We got Super Saiyan!

1896
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:57,950
Oh my gosh.

1897
02:04:58,530 --> 02:04:59,190
Okay.

1898
02:05:00,670 --> 02:05:03,230
Avoid those guys.

1899
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:09,250
Ah!

1900
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:14,690
And even further beyond!

1901
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:23,290
Aibor!

1902
02:05:23,710 --> 02:05:24,210
Is that you?

1903
02:05:25,210 --> 02:05:25,870
Aibor!

1904
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:30,330
Eyeball, look.

1905
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:38,360

1906
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,340
Well, now here.

1907
02:06:00,980 --> 02:06:01,320

Okay.

1909
02:06:07,110 --> 02:06:07,600
Wee!

1910

1911
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:24,120
behind me?

1912
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:41,760
Whoa!

1914
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:50,040
My bad.

1915
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,320
Hi Boa, we're here together.

1916
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:53,080
We're here together.

1917
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:56,820
I'm zooming.

1918
02:06:58,340 --> 02:07:00,060
If I'm missing stuff, sorry.

1919
02:07:01,340 --> 02:07:03,920
I'm just having too much fun.

1920
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:15,840
No secrets here?

1921
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:16,360
Okay!

1922
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:17,420
Thank you!

1923
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:30,460
I should go first.

1924
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:31,900
they're up, but I don't know how to move.

1925
02:07:33,620 --> 02:07:35,180
Wait, I'm stuck.

1926
02:07:35,820 --> 02:07:36,020
Wait.

1927
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:41,730

02:07:42,810 --> 02:07:43,150
Wait.

1929
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:49,190
There we go.

02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:51,370
There we go.

1931
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:51,920
There we go.

1932
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:02,380
Where's my eyeball?

1933
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,380
Oh, there you are.

1934
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:07,200
Aw, did you wait for me?

1935
02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:09,200
Much better eyeball than me.

1936
02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:27,490
I'm gonna kiss them.

1937
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:30,190

I'm trying to talk to you, Eibu.

1941
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:30,240
Can you hear me?

1942
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:33,540
Wait, our scarf is once again gone.

1943
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:42,540
Don't get so close to me.

1944
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:46,940
Eibu.

1945
02:09:49,650 --> 02:09:50,650
Keep your distance.

1946
02:09:58,950 --> 02:10:00,830

1950
02:10:48,170 --> 02:10:50,570
Look at us with just two little triangles.

1951
02:11:02,290 --> 02:11:05,750
I can't tell if I still see us or if that's a speck on my
monitor.

1952
02:11:09,330 --> 02:11:10,750
It's a speck on my monitor.

1953
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,880
Oh my god, it's happening.

1954
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:34,800
Oh my god.

Who's that?

1959
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:23,500
It's going inside.

1960
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:40,350
Where?

1961
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:46,620
All the places we passed.

02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:48,200
Our journey, our journey.

1963
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:51,900
We didn't really travel so far, huh?

1964
02:12:58,690 --> 02:13:02,510
Sometimes the journey is harsh and bleak, but all you can do
is keep going.

1971
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:57,800
Oh, really?

Oh!

1985
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,680
Companions met along the way.

02:16:35,530 --> 02:16:37,290
Thank you, Cash Money Robot!

1988
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:50,080
I've never only seen one companion before.

1989
02:16:52,140 --> 02:16:53,440
What do you mean?

1990
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:55,200
Is that about how many times you've played?

1991
02:16:57,380 --> 02:16:59,180
Because this is my first time playing.

1992
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:03,840
Legendary way to end.

1993
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:08,000
My starting one left.

1994
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:08,520

02:17:12,580 --> 02:17:13,100
Library.

I unlocked.

2000
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:20,160
Reaching the summit with a companion and return to the
beginning.

2001
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:24,080
Finish the game and return to the beginning.

2002
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:28,100
Oh wait, so if you don't even have your companion, I guess
if they die, right?

2003
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:31,120
It was Cash Money Robot, they said so earlier.

2004
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:38,720
Truly the deep emotional, spiritual connection we formed on
this journey with Cash Money Robot.

2005
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:45,160
That was the best reveal.

2006
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:45,640
Ah!

2007
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:48,160
Thank you for being my eyeball.

2008
02:17:57,170 --> 02:17:58,810

02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:01,090
The way it like so slowly.

2010
02:18:01,170 --> 02:18:01,970
faded in.

2011
02:18:04,190 --> 02:18:04,350
Let's see.

2012
02:18:04,610 --> 02:18:08,030
Finish the game with the same partner for the majority of
the journey and return to the beginning.

2013
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:11,130
Only 14% of players have that achievement.

2014
02:18:11,810 --> 02:18:11,830
Wow.

2015
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:19,470
Well, thank you, Cashman, you robot, for for what's the
word?

2016
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:25,450
For being my companion and finishing the game with me.

2017
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:26,790
I really appreciate it.

2018
02:18:27,930 --> 02:18:28,690
Let's see.

2019
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:31,150
I'm looking at some of the locked achievements.

2020
02:18:31,170 --> 02:18:34,070
Start the journey again after a week-long break, okay?

2021
02:18:34,650 --> 02:18:36,050
It's like cookie clicker.

2022
02:18:37,470 --> 02:18:39,230
Find the hidden desert flower.

2023
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:40,410
Oh, interesting.

2024
02:18:41,130 --> 02:18:43,070
Discover all cloth creatures in the desert.

2025
02:18:43,330 --> 02:18:45,830
Oh, we didn't find all of them, interesting.

2026
02:18:48,990 --> 02:18:50,750
Meet 10 or more unique travelers.

2027
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:54,230
Sit and meditate with another player for more than 20
seconds.

2028
02:18:54,990 --> 02:18:55,650
How do you sit?

2029
02:18:58,370 --> 02:19:01,050
Maybe if I, like, stop moving, it's an idle animation.

2030
02:19:02,130 --> 02:19:05,230
Find a mysterious creature hidden in the temple.

2031
02:19:06,770 --> 02:19:10,370
Collect all unique glowing symbols across one or more
journeys.

2032
02:19:11,390 --> 02:19:13,710
Cross the broken bridge without completely rebuilding it.

2033
02:19:14,630 --> 02:19:15,730
Ooh, cool.

2034
02:19:16,670 --> 02:19:18,430
Uncover all 10 ancient glyphs.

2035
02:19:18,510 --> 02:19:19,170
Dang it.

2036
02:19:19,690 --> 02:19:22,470
Pass through 15 gates while surfing through the sunken city.

2037
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:23,370
Dang it.

2038
02:19:25,410 --> 02:19:26,890
You just go AFK.

2039
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:27,970
Ah, okay, okay.

2040
02:19:31,480 --> 02:19:33,000
You did a lot of stuff for yourself.

2041
02:19:33,020 --> 02:19:34,500
No, these are not the things that I did.

2042
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:35,600
These are the locked ones.

2043
02:19:36,420 --> 02:19:38,220
These are the ones that you can still get.

2044
02:19:38,340 --> 02:19:39,880
I only got four achievements.

2045
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:42,400
Which was...

2046
02:19:42,400 --> 02:19:45,740
A sneak through the underground passage without tearing your
scarf.

2047
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:47,800
Finish the game and return to the beginning.

2048
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:51,360
Reach the summit with a companion and return to the
beginning.

2049
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:54,740
And finish the game with the same partner for the majority
of the journey.

2050
02:19:55,180 --> 02:19:56,060
And return to the beginning.

2051
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:00,280
Yeah.

2052
02:20:02,620 --> 02:20:04,840
You can get those outside the map in the sunken zone.

2053
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:05,080
city.

2054
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:05,820
Like, you know what?

2055
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:12,860
Pretty nice game to replay, too.

2056
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:13,740
It seems like it, right?

2057
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:16,800
If you get all scarf upgrades, you unlock white robes.

2058
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:17,880
Really?

2059
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:19,400
Oh, cool.

2060
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:21,780
I do want to maybe play again.

2061
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:26,800
Maybe one day, like, a member stream or something, and
somebody can help me get through.

2062
02:20:26,940 --> 02:20:29,860
We can play more together, like, more games together.

2063
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:35,360
And maybe, like, different people can help me get different
things or something like that.

2064
02:20:37,260 --> 02:20:37,740
Hmm.

2065
02:20:38,940 --> 02:20:39,980
So pretty.

2066
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:40,840
Wee!

2067
02:20:41,140 --> 02:20:42,200
So pretty!

2068
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:43,460
Oh my gosh.

2069
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:45,080
Wee!

2070
02:20:48,390 --> 02:20:48,910
Wee!

2071
02:20:49,550 --> 02:20:49,930
Ha ha ha!

2072
02:20:56,460 --> 02:20:59,060
Still need to get an Ocelot skin from Foxhunt.

2073
02:20:59,200 --> 02:20:59,520
I know.

2074
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:03,780
The game matches you with a different companion whenever you
change map.

2075
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:05,740
The magic is that you don't know it.

2076
02:21:05,860 --> 02:21:09,220
It's rare to make a journey with only one partner, but with
less online players.

2077
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:10,380
Oh!

2078
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:12,280
I see!

2079
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:17,300
So first playthrough, you only match with first players,
which makes the population the match smaller.

2080
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:18,180
Wow!

2081
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:19,920
Oh my gosh!

2082
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:22,000
Also, thank you so much for the Aka doing a...

2083
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,260
Aka super, thank you!

2084
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:27,740
Oh, wow!

2085
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:31,000
Wait, so like, if someone else were trying to play...

2086
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:35,320
And...

2087
02:21:38,580 --> 02:21:39,020
Like...

2088
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:41,160
Wow, so the fact that we...

2089
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:45,120
That it was me and Cash Money Robot the whole time is, like,
super rare.

2090
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:45,500
Rare?

2091
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:47,460
That's crazy!

2092
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:52,940
Wait, that's so cool, though.

2093
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,060
At the same time.

2094
02:21:58,380 --> 02:21:58,880
Wowee.

2095
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:02,540
It will only swap if you get too far away from each other.

2096
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:06,960
Because online is low, probably.

2097
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:13,480
Yeah, probably nowadays it's pretty easy to get that
achievement, I'd say.

2098
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,120
If, well...

2099
02:22:15,140 --> 02:22:15,300
Hmm?

2100
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:17,600
Maybe.

2101
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:29,000
Oh, I'm looking at like some of the other achievements.

2102
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:31,580
The Ancestors One.

2103
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:34,040
Find a mysterious creature hidden in the temple.

2104
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:35,860
Only 8% of players.

2105
02:22:36,700 --> 02:22:38,920
Collect all unique glowing symbols across one or more
journeys.

2106
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:39,820
8%!

2107
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:45,720
Back in the day, there was a dedicated community of white
cloak players that would guide people through the game and

2108
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:46,820
help them find all the secrets.

2109
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:48,340
That's so sweet!

2110
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:50,220
That's so cute.

2111
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:54,340
Well, guys, thank you.

2112
02:22:54,380 --> 02:22:56,780
Well, that's another game off the list, I suppose.

2113
02:22:58,640 --> 02:22:59,440
Another completion.

2114
02:23:00,100 --> 02:23:01,400
Let me add it to my...

2115
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:02,920
To my...

2116
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:04,400
You're a super...

2117
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:05,120
Try Princess!

2118
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:06,740
Thank you!

2119
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:10,580
Also, Daily Dio, I'm so sorry.

2120
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:11,920
I think I missed your don't know earlier.

2121
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,140
It's one of my favorite games of all time.

2122
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:14,900
Short and sweet.

2123
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:15,800
Just like me, too.

2124
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:16,400
Ha ha.

2125
02:23:17,420 --> 02:23:17,780
Alright.

2126
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:20,520
Let's see.

2127
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:23,020
18.

2128
02:23:27,380 --> 02:23:29,400
How many do we have left then?

2129
02:23:31,300 --> 02:23:31,820
Uh...

2130
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:32,380
11!

2131
02:23:33,480 --> 02:23:37,800
11 games left and I'll have completed...

2132
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:38,240
50.

2133
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:38,720
Whoa!

2134
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:40,360
Come back to pink.

2135
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:42,480
Thank you!

2136
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:43,900
Pink for the sunset tan!

2137
02:23:44,300 --> 02:23:48,300
It was scary to lose the scarf in the snow, though not sure
taking clothes off would have held.

2138
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:50,740
Thankfully the real scarf was you all along.

2139
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:52,240
Thank you, Darko!

2140
02:23:53,080 --> 02:23:55,420
Thank you so much for the peek.

2141
02:23:56,600 --> 02:23:58,800
And yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo!

2142
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:05,800
Thanks for this astonishing and beautiful experience, Minky
and Cash Buddy Robot!

2143
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:11,480
I've never played this game, but it did bring me beautiful
memories of Sky Children, and of the Light and Abzu.

2144
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:13,360
Oh yeah, I might!

2145
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:15,400

So lots and lots of streams.

Thanks for the streaming, Tomlondo.

Watching you play this beautiful game.

Bye-bye.

2169

Bye-bye.

2170
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:51,220
Bye-bye.

2171
02:26:51,340 --> 02:26:51,760
Bye-bye-bye.

2172

2174
02:27:29,730 --> 02:27:31,470
You know how I was like?

2175
02:27:32,330 --> 02:27:35,010
My screen protector is all full of scuffs now!

2176
02:27:35,750 --> 02:27:39,730
That drop really did a big scuff on my screen protector!

2177
02:27:41,070 --> 02:27:43,670
I think I'll have to replace it!

2178
02:27:45,390 --> 02:27:47,450
When I dropped my phone earlier!

2179
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:48,690
Dang.

2180
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:58,640
I guess better the screen protector than my own phone,
though, right?

2181
02:27:59,720 --> 02:28:00,420
you
