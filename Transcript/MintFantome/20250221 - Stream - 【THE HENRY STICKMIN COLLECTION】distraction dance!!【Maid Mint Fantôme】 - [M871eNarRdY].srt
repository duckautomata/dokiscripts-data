1
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,000
Welcome in, welcome in, welcome in.

2
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,660
Welcome, welcome.

3
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,040
Hey you.

4
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,820
Hey you!

5
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,860
Welcome...

6
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,040
Sorry.

7
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,780
Welcome to... not the Henry Stickman.

8
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,300
Henry Stickmin.

9
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,940
Minto.

10
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,340
Henry Stickminto maybe.

11
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,230
I don't think I would be a Henry though.

12
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,930
Hi Minto.

13
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,610
Hi!

14
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,950
I'm looking extra...

15
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,690
What shape is that?

16
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,450
Thank you Henry Phantom for today's stream.

17
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,710
No!

18
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,230
I think I'd be more of like a Larry.

19
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,450
If I had to... If I had to give myself another name.

20
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,090
Larry?

21
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,950
What's wrong with Larry?

22
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,630
What's wrong with Larry?

23
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,190
Anyway, welcome everybody.

24
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,270
So, welcome to membership.

25
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,850
I'm Wolf Inokichi.

26
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,750
Welcome to membership.

27
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,650
Thank you guys.

28
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:17,750
Larry Phantom.

29
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,370
Lawrence?

30
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,770
Lawrence.

31
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,370
That's like... That's like such a...

32
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,010
That's like the birth certificate name.

33
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,990
The death certificate name rather.

34
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,190
Hello Minto.

35
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:31,850
Hello!

36
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,170
Delta!

37
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,990
Thank you for the 5 gifted and Takizo!

38
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,290
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

39
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,110
Thank you guys.

40
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,350
You can see the resemblance between me and Henry Stickmin.

41
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,070
Is it because...

42
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,810
I got big ol' eyeballs?

43
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,230
And...

44
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,740
What other...

45
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,740
What other...

46
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,780
Other similarities?

47
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,080
I don't quite see it.

48
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,600
I don't quite see it.

49
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,220
Pinky in the brain and Larry.

50
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,680
Maybe that's where my Larryness comes from.

51
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,120
Maybe that's why I want to be Larry.

52
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,100
I love that episode, Pinky in the brain.

53
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,540
And I love that it's all petty.

54
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,640
It's all just built... It was all created out of pettiness.

55
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,520
You just can't see his hair due to how the projection works.

56
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,440
He's not bald.

57
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,920
I believe you.

58
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,960
Logan, thanks for the 5 gifted and PacType.

59
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,040
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

60
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,080
And Drango, thanks for the 20 gifted.

61
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,320
My goodness.

62
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,880
Hi Minto.

63
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,780
I didn't want to interrupt the collab yesterday, but it was my birthday.

64
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,140
I was wondering if I could get a song from my kami...

65
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,420
Oh, I see.

66
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,300
Thank you for everything.

67
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
Always record for us, Wisps.

68
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,300
I just wanted to say that.

69
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,300
I really appreciate it.

70
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,020
Space is ghost!

71
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,000
OK, we sing happy birthday and then we can start.

72
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,680
Happy birthday to you.

73
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,200
Happy birthday to you.

74
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,280
Happy birthday dear Space is ghost.

75
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,760
That's me.

76
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,380
Well not Space is ghost, but a ghost.

77
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,300
That's me.

78
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,100
Happy birthday to you.

79
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,200
Happy birthday!

80
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,580
Sorry I missed you yesterday.

81
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,200
Pekka says thanks for the 10 gifted.

82
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,120
Why is everybody gifting so many?

83
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,860
Thank you!

84
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,900
I'm a ghost.

85
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,480
Not a space ghost.

86
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,160
I'm a maid ghost.

87
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,720
Not a space ghost.

88
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,440
Just a maid ghost.

89
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,020
Anyway, let's play the Henry Stickmin Collection.

90
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:06,480
I have played this game only once ever before in my afterlife.

91
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,380
But it was many years ago, so I don't really remember much about anything.

92
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,860
So, I'll probably make mistakes.

93
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,740
And I might sometimes not choose the choice that you want me to choose.

94
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,100
Just try not to get too excited and try not to yell at me too much in chat.

95
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,040
I'm sensitive.

96
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,720
I'm sensitive.

97
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,700
So, try not to scream at me in the chat to tell me what to do.

98
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,020
Because it will make me not want to do it even more.

99
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,840
Oh my gosh.

100
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,900
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

101
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,620
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

102
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,700
Detroit, thank you for the pink.

103
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,220
Yato, thank you for the 5.

104
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,100
Fubidu, thank you for the 5.

105
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,740
And Ducky, thank you for the 5 gifted.

106
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,840
Thank you guys all so much.

107
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,740
We died.

108
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,820
I just finished planning for my Japan trip happening in 2 weeks.

109
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,960
I'll be sure to visit Cafe-san for the collab.

110
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,980
Thank you.

111
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,280
Thank you, thank you.

112
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,080
So, remember to pick everything to see.

113
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,980
Pick everything?

114
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,280
I won't be here for too long.

115
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,840
Can we tell you after the game finish?

116
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,680
What do you want to tell me?

117
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,000
What are you trying to tell me, Aiden?

118
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,840
Invisible Moose, thank you for the 10 gifted.

119
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,020
Thank you so much.

120
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,920
Multiple streams.

121
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,140
Everything.

122
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,740
Can't spoil.

123
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,520
It has many wrong choices, but it does not have incorrect choices.

124
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,480
That's so true.

125
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
Doesn't the game encourage you to fail a bunch anyway?

126
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
It encourages you to see all the silly nonsense going on.

127
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,520
Thank you for the Akazupa.

128
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,860
Finally using this for a special occasion as I was always a VOD watcher.

129
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,700
It's my birthday.

130
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,520
I hope you have a beautiful day with Henry.

131
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,260
Scream at her guys, make the VOD more fun.

132
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,720
No!

133
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,620
Don't scream!

134
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,060
Oh my gosh, 2 birthdays!

135
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,560
Zankou, awesome!

136
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,480
Oh my goodness.

137
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,520
I have 2.

138
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,940
We have more birthday songs to sing.

139
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,160
And then...

140
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,040
And then we can start the game.

141
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,820
Or is it Slyve?

142
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,380
Slyve?

143
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,140
Have I been saying it?

144
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,380
Wait.

145
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,720
Slyve.

146
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,220
WiFi time!

147
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,960
Happy birthday!

148
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,700
Um...

149
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,180
Yeah.

150
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,480
It's perfect for all those girl fails out in the world.

151
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,020
Couldn't be me.

152
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,280
Couldn't be me.

153
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,920
Start over.

154
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,400
Why is the game so loud?

155
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,740
Wait, I think there is subtitles.

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,830
We need to reserve a spot for the collab cafe.

157
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,430
Um...

158
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,990
Um...

159
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,790
I don't know.

160
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,930
I do not know.

161
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,130
What is a B2B?

162
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,210
Oh, breaking the bank.

163
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,490
It's only the prologue.

164
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,030
We're fine.

165
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,510
Oh yeah.

166
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,570
Shovel, explosives...

167
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,110
Oh my gosh, there is so many.

168
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,370
Um, obviously...

169
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,850
The disguise would always work best.

170
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,810
I, you know...

171
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,570
It's one of those like...

172
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,570
It's one of those...

173
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,650
Wait, did I get it first try?

174
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,920
That makes sense.

175
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,100
No way!

176
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,940
I was like...

177
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,060
I was gonna say it's kind of a manifestation thing.

178
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,940
You want to become...

179
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,740
Nevermind.

180
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,280
Why Henry?

181
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,620
Henry!

182
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,720
Wait, did I make it in?

183
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:24,860
Wait.

184
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,960
Oh, there was a...

185
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,860
What's a achoo?

186
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,160
Oh, achievements!

187
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,000
And bios.

188
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, okay, okay.

189
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,020
Of the characters.

190
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,720
Of course I love that guy who was...

191
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,740
Standing out there.

192
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,160
Remember the guy who asked about the bank?

193
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,740
He's like the most...

194
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,200
Okay, wait.

195
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
You have to click the characters to unlock them.

196
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,400
Let's try again then.

197
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,440
Retry, retry.

198
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,620
Wait a second though.

199
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,300
Okay, hold on.

200
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,620
We already know what the true one is.

201
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,540
It's real Metal Gear fashion.

202
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,540
I think...

203
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,700
If I were to say...

204
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,660
Let's say if I knew that this...

205
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,280
Or if I didn't know that this was...

206
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,460
I mean that's such an obvious choice, isn't it?

207
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,680
Where does the teleporter send us to?

208
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,200
Oh!

209
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,940
Oh no.

210
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,180
We're not...oh fail.

211
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,840
Cement.

212
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,500
Flame.

213
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,920
Yeah, I'm just too good at this game.

214
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,560
I'm so sorry.

215
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
Is there a car?

216
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:58,860
Explosions?

217
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,060
I like those too.

218
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:01,840
Oh no.

219
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,040
Oh no.

220
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,140
Gosh, Henry...

221
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,000
He's the real girl fail, I think.

222
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,300
Maybe.

223
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,760
I think he's the real girl fail.

224
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,420
Here, shovel.

225
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,120
This is also a classic.

226
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,420
This is like a classic Looney Tunes style.

227
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,380
Oh my gosh, where are we going?

228
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,300
Oh no!

229
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:27,800
What?

230
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,540
Oh my gosh.

231
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,820
Why would there be...

232
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
The cars have...

233
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,500
Can't have that going off all day.

234
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,180
Wait, I got an achievement for that.

235
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,320
I was just trying to see if the cars had bios.

236
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,560
Ok now, I guess we're doing all of them.

237
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,420
Laser!

238
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,200
But I probably won't do this for all of them.

239
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,300
Unless I get it first try.

240
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,160
Nice.

241
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,480
Oh.

242
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,620
Not nice.

243
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,580
Wrecking ball.

244
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,980
Miley Cyrus style.

245
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,620
I'm clicking on him.

246
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,280
I'm clicking on him.

247
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,060
Oh he's like what?

248
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,800
We didn't schedule for today?

249
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,580
What?

250
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,560
There is no construction scheduled for today.

251
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:13,900
Literally.

252
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,300
Oh it's right click.

253
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,500
You gotta right click.

254
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,560
Ok, hold on.

255
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,820
I probably will be able to get them with this one.

256
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,660
Ok, we continue.

257
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,220
Right, right.

258
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,260
This guy...

259
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,640
Sounds like grandpa.

260
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,780
Yes!

261
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,500
Yes!

262
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,340
Who is he?

263
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,660
They're gonna kill him for questioning too much.

264
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,780
It includes Henry, but I got the achievement so...

265
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,000
No, I'm clicking on him.

266
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,780
It doesn't do anything.

267
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,500
But we made it inside.

268
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,880
We're such a bad boy.

269
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,240
Oh my god.

270
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,640
We're not robbing the bank.

271
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,320
We're just... Why didn't we go through the front door?

272
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,960
Escaping the prison.

273
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,040
Aw yeah.

274
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,200
Nice cursor, thank you.

275
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,900
Oh yeah.

276
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,100
Where...

277
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,780
Oh.

278
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,060
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,760
Of course I checked it.

280
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,420
I mean, if I didn't check it, I'd lose my job.

281
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,420
And I don't wanna lose my job.

282
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,260
Oh Dave.

283
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,280
See you around.

284
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,620
Happy birthday to us.

285
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,070
Another classic.

286
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,010
A file.

287
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,290
Right?

288
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,750
What is a NRG drink?

289
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,710
NR...

290
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,010
NRG drink.

291
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,390
Energy.

292
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,310
NRG.

293
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,930
Like a Gatorade?

294
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,530
Oh gosh, the drill one is so loud.

295
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,810
I'm gonna... You know what?

296
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,030
I'm letting the teleporter redeem itself.

297
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,210
Oh yeah.

298
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,470
You just can't seem to get the hang of that thing, can you?

299
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,390
It's like literally the safest place to ever do it.

300
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,390
Oops.

301
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,610
Retry.

302
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,410
We're fine.

303
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,030
You know what?

304
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,350
Let's try the NRG drink.

305
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:16,690
Oh!

306
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,290
Oh!

307
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,930
Oh my god.

308
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,230
Oh my god!

309
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,910
What's in this thing?

310
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,810
Who are you?

311
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,490
That's Larry right there.

312
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:27,890
Oh my gosh.

313
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,470
Dave.

314
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,850
Oh my god!

315
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,150
Throw him out.

316
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,510
Who are you?

317
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,370
Who are you?

318
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,110
Who are you?

319
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,290
I can barely see your name.

320
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,570
Was it so easy?

321
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,680
Oh no.

322
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,420
Oh no.

323
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,680
NRG side effects include nausea, headaches, rapid heart rate and possibilities of stroke and or heart attack.

324
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,280
Henry Stickmin lord goes crazy.

325
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,220
Who have we seen?

326
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:06,980
Oh my gosh.

327
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There are still so many guys.

328
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,460
We got Dave Pampa.

329
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,860
Rupert Price.

330
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,000
What are these names?

331
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,920
We got Blade Knife Man McGee.

332
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,480
Who is this guy?

333
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,000
Kev Portley.

334
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,900
He wants to eat donuts.

335
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,580
He just wants to eat donuts.

336
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,940
Stump Blump.

337
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,580
Ryan Goldman.

338
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,360
Oh that's what it said.

339
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,760
Employee of the month.

340
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,780
Fancy.

341
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,600
Oh they have different rarities too.

342
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,900
Or Dragon Balls?

343
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,140
What are these?

344
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,000
What are these?

345
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,920
This is a 3 Dragon Ball.

346
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,660
I kind of like Knife Man.

347
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,600
Evil Knife Guy.

348
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,480
Cool.

349
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,120
Nice.

350
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,240
Here is Stump Blump.

351
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,640
Oh gosh.

352
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,120
If I were in this situation...

353
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,220
See a drill just makes too much sense.

354
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,220
What if I call...

355
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,480
With a cellphone you can do anything.

356
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:14,840
Ever.

357
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,740
You can...as long as you have service.

358
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,560
Oh my gosh an attorney!

359
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,520
Why are we Ace Attorney?

360
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,420
Wait, actual Ace Attorney!

361
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,280
Hm?

362
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,360
OBJECTION!

363
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,760
How did I know?

364
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,140
Who the hell is you?

365
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:52,880
Wait.

366
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,360
I forgot to get the BIOS.

367
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,140
What is this?

368
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,020
Defendant suffered many bruises and cuts.

369
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,520
Security footage of the night of the intrusion shows the defendant leaving his disguise and setting off the alarm.

370
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,440
Device...Diagram...Wait what was it?

371
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,440
I wasn't paying attention.

372
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,060
Our attorney's badge!

373
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,520
Ok, I'm not going to lie.

374
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,080
The badge looks so delicious in Ace Attorney.

375
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,960
It looks like a little cookie.

376
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,680
When I was a kid I always wanted to eat it.

377
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,960
Present the badge.

378
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,620
Oh I already had it.

379
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,080
That's right.

380
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,740
What is this?

381
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,080
It's evidence.

382
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,920
And how exactly does this prove anything?

383
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,060
Why?

384
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,080
I was just kidding.

385
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,920
This is no time for jokes.

386
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,700
I see no reason to further prolong this trial.

387
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,040
I find the defendant Henry Stickmin.

388
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,760
I could have gotten out of that, couldn't I?

389
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,720
Wait!

390
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,180
Oh!

391
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,640
We're here, we're here.

392
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm trying to find evidence of something.

393
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Oh wait, the knot is tied on the outside.

394
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,900
Wait, maybe that.

395
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,140
How could I do that?

396
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,180
Is that the bag the defendant hid in?

397
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,740
Yes, but there's one thing that's been bothering me.

398
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,580
How did he tie it?

399
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,920
If the defendant really was hiding in this bag then...

400
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,360
How did he tie the knot from the outside of the bag?

401
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,480
If he was inside the bag, it would be impossible for him to tie that knot on the outside.

402
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,220
But then, how did he do it?

403
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,420
It's simple.

404
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,920
He didn't.

405
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,680
What are you saying?

406
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,060
Who is this guy?

407
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,640
The defendant wasn't hiding in that bag at all.

408
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,940
He was stopped in there by this very witness.

409
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,380
As you can see by this doctor's analysis, the defendant had taken quite the beating.

410
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,840
While he was in the bag, he was unconscious.

411
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,780
Oh my god, this is some real gaslighting.

412
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,660
This is absurd.

413
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,080
This is some grade A gaslighting here.

414
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,760
It's Von Karma.

415
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,980
What?

416
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,760
All the other body bags?

417
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,880
You guys can't...this can't be happening to me!

418
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,280
Ah, classic crash out.

419
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,460
Classic Ace Attorney crash out.

420
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,620
I'm getting busted for some...

421
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,620
Oh yeah!

422
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,380
Not guilty!

423
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:51,980
Yay!

424
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:52,900
Confetti!

425
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,960
I'm wired up!

426
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,400
Did I win?

427
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,140
It's so loud all of a sudden.

428
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,320
I did so well, actually.

429
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,560
I missed so many people.

430
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,910
We need to know who this guy is.

431
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,220
Wait.

432
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,460
We learned these guys.

433
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,340
Felix White.

434
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,100
Hubert Brown.

435
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,020
Is everybody a color?

436
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,760
Vladimir Von Braun.

437
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,160
Winston Davis.

438
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,780
Stupid Winston.

439
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,580
Who the hell is this guy?

440
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,940
Skelly!

441
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,940
Oh no, ok.

442
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,260
It doesn't let me re-go back.

443
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,740
So I guess we'll just continue onward.

444
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,340
I don't...what's the map?

445
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,480
Oh wait, can I skip to here?

446
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,820
Oh, well, I just skipped.

447
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,340
Just kidding.

448
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,200
Ok, this one is definitely gonna get us to Skellyman.

449
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,060
I gotta know.

450
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,200
Who is he?

451
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,020
We made it to the...oh, to a bathroom.

452
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,500
Oh!

453
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,940
What's a...

454
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,360
Oppositator.

455
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,340
Opacity.

456
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,820
Oh, you'll walk through walls.

457
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,880
Just move the blue slider to the right and you'll become opaque.

458
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,560
Oh!

459
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,560
The more opaque you get, the easier it will be for you to pass through solid objects.

460
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,860
But what if I cut through the world?

461
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:54,780
Ok.

462
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,840
What if I...have I become too opaque?

463
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,240
See?

464
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,560
Here I go.

465
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,620
I got him.

466
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,140
I got him.

467
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,440
I got him.

468
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,400
There is a knife.

469
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,440
There he is!

470
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,120
Oopsie.

471
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,080
Wait, so crowbar...

472
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,700
We do this and then we are sneaking through the sewer.

473
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,240
Hello?

474
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,220
That guy has got kind of a giant gun.

475
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,700
Wait, is there more than one way to get out of here?

476
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,520
Left!

477
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:36,880
Left!

478
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,700
Wait, what happened?

479
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,740
Try dodging the bullets, noob!

480
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,140
Multiple endings?

481
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,980
No way!

482
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,340
I said three endings.

483
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,180
I didn't know if those were fails or not.

484
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,840
I don't know.

485
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,580
Such a product of it's time.

486
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,280
Oh, this way!

487
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,700
Sorry.

488
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm good.

489
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,540
I know.

490
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,060
They just have too big of guns!

491
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,600
Left!

492
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,080
Lowbrow reference?

493
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,820
Huh?

494
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,760
What?

495
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,720
Like, obviously smash, but...

496
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,020
You can slip and brawl.

497
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,080
No way.

498
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,060
Wait, did I not press this button before?

499
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,740
Maybe I'm...

500
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,520
Get Matrixed!

501
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,400
Oh, I already got him.

502
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,660
Get ready.

503
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,800
Get ready.

504
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,960
I'm ready.

505
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,460
I'm ready.

506
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:51,560
I'm ready.

507
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Ready?

508
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,480
Oh, nevermind.

509
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,880
That seems a little unfair.

510
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,440
Skip, skip, skip.

511
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,720
I said click.

512
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,240
Ok, I'm going to click as fast as I can.

513
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,440
Not ready.

514
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,220
I was ready!

515
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,540
Oh yeah!

516
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,180
Oh my God!

517
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,220
Yeah, skinny Willy.

518
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,020
Right there.

519
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,720
Oh my God!

520
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,740
Bang!

521
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,160
Bang!

522
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,100
Don't turn your back on them, Henry!

523
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,260
I think this was my favorite one.

524
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,720
As much as I love Ace Attorney...

525
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,220
BBO...

526
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,780
What does that mean?

527
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,600
Oh, wait.

528
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:03,840
Badass...

529
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,540
Audi.

530
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,880
Ok, so we did that one.

531
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,560
Now we... Wait, 2 out of 4?

532
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,800
We did the teleporter.

533
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
We did the cellphone, we did the joke, we did the energy drink.

534
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,080
Ok, now we just have...

535
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,980
The file.

536
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,520
The window!

537
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,040
Oh my gosh, a classic.

538
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,680
I should have known that.

539
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,260
We have literally seen that.

540
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,340
We are on like the 10th floor.

541
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,400
The door, the door.

542
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,600
How was I supposed to know he wouldn't grow like little spiders on his fingers and crawl down the walls?

543
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,740
What was he?

544
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,720
I clicked!

545
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,280
I clicked!

546
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,160
I clicked!

547
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,700
Click!

548
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,360
Yeah!

549
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,020
Click!

550
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,790
I was also trying to get bios though.

551
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,420
He's escaping.

552
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,880
No, I'm not.

553
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,160
Ok, so belt and grenades just sound cooler, right?

554
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,960
Oh my god!

555
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,760
No!

556
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,000
Oopsie.

557
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,000
In theory that would have been better.

558
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,060
Our throw was just too good.

559
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,920
Too precise.

560
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,880
Left or right guys?

561
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,540
Left or right?

562
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,160
Gamers...

563
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,180
It's like when you follow the path of a wall, right?

564
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,430
Left!

565
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,050
And a maze, right?

566
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,330
Hi!

567
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,030
So rude to the janitor.

568
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,530
Get a lady.

569
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,110
What do you mean fatty?

570
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,250
No!

571
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,030
I think I missed one though.

572
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,930
Hold on, I'm going to try and go back there.

573
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,590
I'm going to try and go back and get that one bio.

574
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,210
I'm not trying 100% the game or anything, but I don't know how I'm feeling.

575
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,370
I'm going 100% right now.

576
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,190
It's this guy.

577
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,050
I got the other guy.

578
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,110
We got him!

579
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,310
You sure?

580
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,570
I'm just looking around.

581
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,430
You guys know I like to explore.

582
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,390
Just a box.

583
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,350
In that box are plungers!

584
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,990
These are the best ones.

585
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,030
Yeah, just like that!

586
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,070
Worry fatty Minto.

587
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:03,530
No!

588
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,260
Sneaky escapist.

589
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,740
I'm too good.

590
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,060
There are just a few fails that we haven't gotten.

591
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,300
Let's see, if I go back here.

592
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,020
And we do the rocket launcher.

593
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,690
We were...

594
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,930
Again, our aim is just too precise.

595
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,010
Our aim is too good.

596
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,330
1 out of 2?

597
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,410
Oh!

598
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,530
Wait, 0 out of 3?

599
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,030
I see, I see.

600
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,810
So we click here, but we don't click on the other one.

601
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,490
What?

602
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,410
He sounded so wimpy.

603
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,110
Ok, now here...

604
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:21,110
You guys, I'm just so good at being sneaky and everything.

605
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,970
I knew the plungers would work immediately.

606
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,910
It's the obvious, obvious, the most obvious choice.

607
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,910
Dave isn't a wimp.

608
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,150
How many people...

609
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,870
Look at this.

610
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,430
Who are these guys?

611
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,550
Who?

612
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,590
There's all like just tiny people.

613
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,950
Who are you?

614
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,190
There's so many people.

615
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,210
Look, I almost got every single person here.

616
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,450
Carlos.

617
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,050
Harold.

618
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,350
Straight shoot.

619
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:00,670
My gosh.

620
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,150
These are the...

621
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,870
No, these aren't the...

622
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,930
These are not the Matrix guys.

623
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,990
Oh, maybe these are the Matrix guys.

624
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,430
Yeah, yeah, these ones at the bottom.

625
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,510
John?

626
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,970
Who is the lady with the long hair?

627
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,530
We got... Oh, Jen.

628
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,190
Wasn't there another person with the last name Brun?

629
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,130
Conflict of interest?

630
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,010
A Nepo baby?

631
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,530
Ok, anyway.

632
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,330
Let's do the rope.

633
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,470
What?

634
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:51,000
Where did it even connect to?

635
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,860
Is there a chute?

636
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,980
Isekai.

637
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,400
BB Kim's actual Henry Stickman.

638
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,460
Oh!

639
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,820
I think it was just a regular backpack.

640
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,440
See what happens when you assume.

641
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,440
That's so dumb.

642
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,260
Ok, jetpack.

643
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,600
That's the Miso I remember.

644
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,540
Oh, it worked!

645
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,280
Ok, we are just like a little mosquito.

646
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,140
Oh!

647
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,780
Get all 18 unique fails in escaping the prison.

648
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,680
Yeah baby!

649
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,620
Which one should we... I like...

650
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,600
I like...

651
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,420
I like...

652
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,740
I like the badass bust out.

653
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,220
Can I go here?

654
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,480
Do I have to do it again?

655
00:36:59,580 --> 00:36:59,920
Click.

656
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,620
Oh wait.

657
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:03,860
Yes!

658
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,460
Yes!

659
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,300
Click!

660
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,400
I got him.

661
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,640
I'm a pro gamer.

662
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,040
Yeah, pretty much.

663
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,040
I missed some mysterious people, but that's fine.

664
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,260
They will remain mysterious in our hearts.

665
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,340
Nice.

666
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,340
Stealing the diamond.

667
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,220
What is this?

668
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:53,760
Minecraft?

669
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,520
Open!

670
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,220
Open!

671
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,680
Is Henry a bad guy?

672
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,760
Is Henry not a good guy, you think?

673
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,560
He's stealing diamonds now.

674
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,580
Ok, we can bust it.

675
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,400
I feel like I have to say sneak in.

676
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,600
Because I'm like...

677
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,180
It's just part of my branding.

678
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,460
The actual sneak...

679
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:32,340
So these go up and these go in.

680
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,500
Minecraft Reel!

681
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,240
It actually became Minecraft!

682
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,800
I have a bomb here.

683
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,560
Why would they keep live bombs in a museum?

684
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,800
It's not...well, it's...

685
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,160
It's...

686
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,120
Ok, oh!

687
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,000
Oh wait, there is a plane.

688
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,660
There is a gun.

689
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,380
It's a bird.

690
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,080
It's a plane!

691
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,060
No, it's a gun!

692
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,620
Pretend you were joking.

693
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Ok, it's a plane.

694
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,500
I gotta warn someone.

695
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,560
It's a haunted museum.

696
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,860
Let's go to the retro room.

697
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,360
Retro.

698
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,140
Retro.

699
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,300
Nice, nice.

700
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Oh my gosh!

701
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,800
It was...

702
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,040
Luigi!

703
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,320
Good ball.

704
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,350
That's a sound.

705
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,830
Pick your reference.

706
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,730
Pretty much.

707
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,090
Let's go with the good ball.

708
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,390
It's not a great ball.

709
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,430
Isn't there like a Pokemon Direct happening soon or something?

710
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,690
Joe!

711
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:27,870
Go!

712
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,830
Go!

713
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:29,590
Oh no!

714
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,260
Oopsie!

715
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,040
Missing note!

716
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,040
Don't worry about it.

717
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,060
Don't worry about it.

718
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,420
Don't worry about it.

719
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,560
Mushroom!

720
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,940
I have these guys.

721
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,580
Oh my God!

722
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,720
These are antiques!

723
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,160
What the hell?

724
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,920
Guy almost crushed.

725
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,960
Wait, what's happening?

726
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,820
You can click the paintings.

727
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,460
Oh you can!

728
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,480
Oh my God.

729
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,100
I'm leaving this decision up to you Corporal.

730
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,820
Just hit one of those buttons to deal with this pressing situation.

731
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,920
Oh it hurts!

732
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,600
Oh I get to click!

733
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,480
What

734
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,450
is that sound effect from?

735
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,970
I heard it recently I feel.

736
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,410
Oh my God!

737
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,990
Can this ancient wisp who is approaching her late 20's get a B-Day song?

738
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,930
Delina!

739
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,910
Ok, we'll do a quick happy birthday.

740
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,610
Happy birthday to you!

741
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,370
Happy birthday to you!

742
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,370
Happy birthday dear Delina!

743
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:37,410
Happy birthday to you!

744
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,190
Happy birthday!

745
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,110
Don't feel too bad.

746
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,310
He probably camped for the 25 kills he needed to get that nuke.

747
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,230
I feel like I've heard that noise.

748
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:53,190
I saw some of you guys say Call of Duty, but I feel like I heard it somewhere else recently.

749
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:54,770
Completely unrelated.

750
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,750
Nuke is from Call of Duty.

751
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:01,990
I guess they...

752
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,450
It's become a meme.

753
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:06,710
Fireworks?

754
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,130
Was it the fireworks simulator?

755
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,290
Oh it was!

756
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,910
It was the fireworks simulator!

757
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,510
That's so funny!

758
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:23,870
What's this?

759
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,590
Oh my gosh, is this dividing by zero?

760
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,070
You can't do that!

761
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,090
It's a surprise if you click the sun and the moon.

762
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,810
Oh think about it.

763
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:35,350
Thank you!

764
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,500
Where is everyone?

765
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,680
Let's do the satellite.

766
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,000
No!

767
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,180
No!

768
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,680
Oh

769
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,260
gosh!

770
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,040
I just aged 20 years.

771
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,640
I mean do you see your profile picture?

772
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,460
Oh gosh!

773
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,500
Oh gosh!

774
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,260
This game is such a product of it's time.

775
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,400
Zoomers can't play this game.

776
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,300
They don't understand.

777
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,660
They don't understand!

778
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,400
Oh my god!

779
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:37,640
Click

780
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,530
on the guy!

781
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,220
What is going on?

782
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,260
What did that do?

783
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,340
We got the thing.

784
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,040
That's not Doomguy actually.

785
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,400
He looks different.

786
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,700
He looks a little different.

787
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,480
Click on the moon.

788
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,280
Nothing happened.

789
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,240
Oh there.

790
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,320
Nothing happened.

791
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,690
JPE

792
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,100
This one was lame.

793
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,800
2008 was 40 years ago.

794
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,000
This ending... Oh my gosh!

795
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:36,560
40!

796
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,220
Okay, we'll just try for the... Wait.

797
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,860
We'll just try for the...

798
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,720
What's it called?

799
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,210
A different ending.

800
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:50,570
Sorry.

801
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:51,890
I took a nap earlier.

802
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,350
I was so sleepy.

803
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:57,050
Then I woke up and I had two cats on me.

804
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,430
I was just laying in bed probably until like...

805
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,430
Not very long ago.

806
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,910
Let's go from the beginning since I'm too good at this game.

807
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,690
Anti-gravity cap.

808
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:11,850
We're going up baby.

809
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,490
Oh no.

810
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:18,490
I had a feeling.

811
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,470
I've always wanted to go to space.

812
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:22,270
Space!

813
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:26,550
Okay, I'm giving the teleporter another try.

814
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,190
It will eventually work.

815
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,390
He looks so nervous every time he uses it.

816
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,860
It worked!

817
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,540
Hell yeah.

818
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,880
Oh, I tried to click him.

819
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,600
Yeah, tranquilize.

820
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,040
Oh my God!

821
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,360
Where did that come from?

822
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:51,820
Huh?

823
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,180
How?

824
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,600
How?

825
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:55,400
How?

826
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,580
Falcon punch!

827
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,320
Only one man is capable of that punch.

828
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,380
We were a fool.

829
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,640
The vents?

830
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,100
Oh.

831
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,780
If I woke up with two cats on me, I'd just let that be my whole day so you're stronger than me.

832
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,060
It was very hard.

833
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,500
I'll be honest.

834
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,920
I was like, should I cancel stream?

835
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,420
A penny.

836
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,540
A shiny penny.

837
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,620
I feel like this is the actual answer so I'm going to use the invisibility pill.

838
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,820
What if it shrunk our body and we became a child?

839
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,140
Oh, what happened?

840
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,820
Okay, the penny.

841
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,260
So fast.

842
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,680
Wormhole rifle.

843
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,490
He was so speedy.

844
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,150
Thanks for sharing the pies picture.

845
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,150
It was really cute.

846
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,550
It was her first time ever laying on that pillow.

847
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,030
I was so happy.

848
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,430
I have two foxhound pillows if you didn't see the picture.

849
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,930
I have two foxhound pillows and she laid on one of them.

850
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,710
Well, there was a second one she was kind of on too.

851
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:20,710
Is this supposed to be like the...

852
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,710
Portal?

853
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,470
Oh, it is a portal.

854
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,250
Why does he sound like this?

855
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,190
Why does Henry sound like such a...

856
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:35,530
He sounds so wimpy.

857
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:36,670
It's like...

858
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,690
I'm surprised you weren't able to get down there with that amazing portal technology.

859
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,290
It's pretty strange how those portal guns work.

860
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:50,690
I mean, it combines the top scientific process of our time.

861
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:56,710
The portal gun contains a flux quantum generator which propels energy blasts with energy values of 4.3...

862
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,250
Oh, 2.3 GW.

863
00:48:58,990 --> 00:48:59,370
GW.

864
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,370
With an average speed of approximately 25...

865
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,450
What is that?

866
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:08,330
GW.

867
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,650
Was that the beginning part of the case closed you just sang?

868
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:14,190
Yeah!

869
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,690
It's not milliseconds.

870
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,030
It would be MS, right?

871
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,910
So this would be meters per second?

872
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,330
The speed is...

873
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,530
25 meters per second feels so fast.

874
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,660
The speed is the most optimal because it allows the energy to be conserved while maintaining...

875
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,000
Oh, wait.

876
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,100
It shoots the thing...

877
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,820
Oh, it shoots the energy blast with a speed of 25 meters per second.

878
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:48,700
Ah, okay.

879
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,240
I was thinking that...

880
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,440
I don't know.

881
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,160
It allows the energy...

882
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,380
Sorry, guys.

883
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,240
...to be conserved while still maintaining a speed that is appropriate.

884
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,500
The external plastic casing on the portal gun is constructed of a high-polymer fireproof carbon fiber.

885
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,120
This prevents the intense energy of the portal gun from burning the hands of the user.

886
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,440
The intense energy causes intense heat.

887
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,480
Oh, by the way, if you want an achievement, click here.

888
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:18,800
Yippee!

889
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:28,430
I have heard that scientists still do not know what happens if two portals are placed on top of each other the last time that was attempted.

890
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,910
Well, I'm sure you heard about that on the news.

891
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,150
Yay!

892
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,710
DLDR.

893
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,430
Okay, we're gonna wire in Mission Impossible.

894
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,850
Actually, I'm just gonna drop in.

895
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,250
I did think it would work.

896
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:55,500
I did think that would work.

897
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,480
The click achievement is very Homestar Runner core.

898
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,360
Is it right?

899
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,040
Gosh, same era.

900
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,420
It's functional up to 6,000 degrees Kelvin.

901
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,940
Not Kelvin.

902
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:12,220
Kelvin just sounds like the name of someone in class that you'd be like, Shut up, Kelvin.

903
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,440
Kelvin would always be like, Well, actually, teacher, we had homework last night.

904
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,260
And you'd be like, Shut up, Kelvin.

905
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,960
God, why do you have to remind the teacher about the homework?

906
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,260
It doesn't work.

907
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,280
Laser cutter.

908
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,440
Hammer.

909
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,200
One is very high tech and one is violence.

910
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,800
Oh man, I thought we could get the paintings.

911
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,040
Wait, that actually worked.

912
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,040
It's not...

913
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,180
Tease.

914
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,680
I thought we were...

915
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,320
It had no special properties at all.

916
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,280
I thought we were teasing the game.

917
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,840
Smoking gun.

918
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,680
Diamond, obviously.

919
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,010
Henry, you're a murderer!

920
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,870
A rich murderer.

921
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,650
It's not murder if there's no blood.

922
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:02,270
True.

923
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,390
Let's see.

924
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,610
Gosh, there's probably...

925
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:11,330
We didn't get like anything here.

926
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,470
Here, let's try the laser cutter.

927
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,270
This one is fast.

928
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,230
You get cut.

929
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:21,450
Why you no bleed?

930
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:26,370
The laser...

931
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:28,470
Cauterized it.

932
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:30,810
How did they even explain it?

933
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:31,150
Wow.

934
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,990
Why you no...

935
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,990
Oh no!

936
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:45,770
Okay.

937
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,550
Ancient language.

938
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,130
I've seen these runes before.

939
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:56,370
Hold on.

940
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,370
We need to ask...

941
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,730
It's like... Oh my gosh.

942
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,630
In like 20 years time.

943
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,030
Not even.

944
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,970
Nowadays even you could do this.

945
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:10,810
You could be like... There's gonna be a movie that shows like...

946
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:11,750
Why you no bleed?

947
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:12,750
And they're gonna be like... I don't know.

948
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:13,750
There's gonna be some like...

949
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,430
Some kids are like... I don't get what it says!

950
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,950
We need to go ask grandpa!

951
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:21,150
And grandpa is like sitting in chair in his like...

952
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,130
Lounge at home.

953
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:22,950
And he's just there like...

954
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,930
Grandpa, we found these ancient texts.

955
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,470
We need you to decipher them.

956
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:29,890
And he like reads it and it's just like...

957
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:31,110
Shoop da whoop.

958
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,310
And then he has that Ratatouille moment.

959
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,110
And he's like...

960
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,490
And then he's just like...

961
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,110
A single tear runs down his cheek.

962
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,050
And he's like...

963
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,210
I haven't seen this.

964
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,470
Where did you find this?

965
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:54,450
You kids nowadays only know Skibbity Riz.

966
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:56,250
But...

967
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,170
Shoop da whoop.

968
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:59,710
Walked so Skibbity could run.

969
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:03,830
It's been...

970
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,770
He's gotta say...

971
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,950
It's been 84 years.

972
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,770
What is bro saying?

973
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:15,430
Like okay grandpa.

974
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,830
Actual okay grandpa moment.

975
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,210
This one we did...

976
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:24,190
Most of them.

977
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,690
This one, we didn't do this one.

978
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:27,010
It's like...

979
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:27,690
This...

980
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,630
Oh this heads to the...

981
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:32,330
This heads to the retro room and this heads straight to the diamond.

982
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:39,290
Must be a light sleeper.

983
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:41,690
She's cracked the code.

984
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,190
Scatter!

985
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,070
I take why you know over Skibbity any day of the week.

986
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,670
That just means you've matured baby.

987
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,430
I don't know actually.

988
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,550
We missed one here.

989
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,430
What did I miss here?

990
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,430
I got the bomb.

991
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:56,090
Oh I think I have to run out of time.

992
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:02,110
I just wanted to get to know each other a little bit.

993
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,850
I just kind of wanted to have a conversation.

994
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,250
Just lighten things up.

995
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,650
They are like having their own little conversation.

996
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:13,910
What's going on?

997
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:15,830
Okay.

998
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:17,470
Oh the portrait!

999
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:18,750
Sorry.

1000
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:19,510
It's okay.

1001
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,610
I'm more interested in getting the endings than getting all the bios.

1002
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,170
Wait can I even get Luigi?

1003
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:24,690
No.

1004
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:26,150
Alien.

1005
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,170
I got one out of thirty.

1006
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,450
There's thirty of them?

1007
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:36,430
Get headcrabbed.

1008
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,030
We did...

1009
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,610
The mushroom and the ball.

1010
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,770
We did not do the crowbar.

1011
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,170
We expect so many memories.

1012
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,620
This is actual headcrab.

1013
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,240
Sorry the other one was not the headcrab.

1014
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,540
These are the actual headcrabs.

1015
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,020
What's the other one from?

1016
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:04,800
Metroid?

1017
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:09,660
Metroid.

1018
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,260
I knew it.

1019
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,660
Okay let's see.

1020
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,040
This is the beginning one.

1021
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:20,510
We still...

1022
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,840
Okay we did the teleporter.

1023
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,600
We did this.

1024
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,220
Oh we did the anti-gravity.

1025
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,220
Jumbo hoppers.

1026
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,140
There he goes.

1027
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,040
Oh my gosh.

1028
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:37,560
Wait.

1029
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,320
Wait what is that a reference to?

1030
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,240
Do it two more times.

1031
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,220
Wait actually...

1032
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,220
Pilotwings64.

1033
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,680
Sweet flip bro.

1034
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:02,980
Minus four.

1035
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,980
It didn't say anything different though.

1036
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,160
2008 was seventeen years ago.

1037
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,620
Oh wait.

1038
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,040
Map.

1039
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:35,420
Sorry.

1040
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,100
What are we trying?

1041
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,080
Trinket.

1042
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,500
Oh we can go through the little crack.

1043
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:39,960
There we go.

1044
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,740
Look how small he is.

1045
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:58,590
Yeah, actually 2020 was twenty years ago.

1046
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,130
How do you feel about that now?

1047
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,050
Do you feel old?

1048
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,010
Liquidificator.

1049
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:10,450
So true.

1050
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,670
Ten out of ten.

1051
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:20,110
It's a fantastically easy to use gadget game.

1052
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,250
I trust that guy with my life.

1053
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,800
We turned into human liquid.

1054
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,820
Take that for what you will.

1055
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:48,840
Okay, this one we had the canon that we still needed to do.

1056
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:54,860
Earlier today I had to hold myself back from saying can I has cheeseburger when I was working at McDonald's.

1057
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:04,780
I came to this dream for silly deaths and references not existential dread.

1058
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,780
No!

1059
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,800
The can I has cheeseburger.

1060
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:23,080
Sometimes I say that though as unironically and I'm afraid that one day I'll say...

1061
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,520
You know when you say things unironically?

1062
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:32,680
Like for the bit and then it becomes part of your actual vernacular and you're just like oh no I don't think it's a bit anymore.

1063
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,840
Wait I'm doing this for real?

1064
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,040
You say it as a joke until it becomes... yeah like my cats.

1065
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,580
Because you know everybody does like that pet talk.

1066
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:52,320
You know like the way you speak to your animals like to your pets is like different.

1067
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,300
And so I'll be like...

1068
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,820
He says can I has cheeseburger.

1069
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,510
Like so stupid.

1070
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:10,690
You guys don't talk to your pets weird?

1071
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:14,950
I have full conversations with my pets.

1072
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,470
Like the way Butaro speaks.

1073
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:25,570
I know how I think he's actually... I feel like he's projecting his thoughts into my brain.

1074
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,030
And then I have a full conversation and he'll be like...

1075
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,190
He'll be like...

1076
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,390
Oh I'm cold.

1077
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,250
I'll be like you need to lay in the blanket then.

1078
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:36,610
He's like no I don't wanna.

1079
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:37,570
I don't know.

1080
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:38,790
It always just comes to...

1081
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:39,910
I can't recreate it.

1082
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,590
It's something that comes to me in the moment.

1083
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,930
Because you are insane.

1084
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,230
No I'm not!

1085
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,090
I'm not!

1086
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:56,030
It's the meds.

1087
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:57,650
It's the meds talking.

1088
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:58,450
No!

1089
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,730
Everybody does this with their pets.

1090
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:05,570
What is the unique things your cat can do?

1091
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,390
Nothing.

1092
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:07,210
He sucks.

1093
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,130
I like how she's doing the nostalgia thing in-game without even playing.

1094
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:13,610
Shut up!

1095
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:15,290
Thank you guys for all the superchats.

1096
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:16,490
Talking.

1097
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:17,290
Schizo arc.

1098
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:17,570
No!

1099
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:23,310
Can I get a late two day birthday from you?

1100
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:25,110
I can sing happy birthday!

1101
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:27,330
Sorry for being late.

1102
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,950
Happy birthday to you.

1103
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,110
Happy birthday to you.

1104
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:35,890
Happy birthday IDK.

1105
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,770
Happy birthday to you.

1106
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:42,970
Happy birthday.

1107
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,670
Please cease this immediately for your own reputation.

1108
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:54,270
I know someone at work who says alright chat we need to chill and mods ban them.

1109
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:03,370
But at one point does it stop being cringe and starts becoming iconic.

1110
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:05,610
Right?

1111
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:10,530
At one point are you like oh no this guy is so iconic.

1112
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:16,370
The cringe to iconic circle is very...

1113
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:25,040
So cringe it warps back.

1114
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:25,420
Right?

1115
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,660
There's two sides of the same coin I believe.

1116
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,520
I'm sending this to you.

1117
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,760
It's not my birthday.

1118
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,920
I won't sing you happy birthday then.

1119
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,040
My cat says it's perfectly normal to talk to cats.

1120
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,500
Maybe I'm just lonely.

1121
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,220
I don't know.

1122
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,500
I don't talk to many people.

1123
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,520
I talk to you guys.

1124
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:52,480
That's why if I don't stream for a day I become all pent up with yappy energy.

1125
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,080
I talk to nobody.

1126
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,300
Anyway, we need to do the cannon.

1127
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,840
Oh I got the painting.

1128
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:05,620
Oh it fell.

1129
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:06,160
Oh gosh.

1130
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:06,940
Come on Henry.

1131
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,320
It worked.

1132
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,740
Ending there's another route at the start.

1133
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,380
It's okay you guys seriously.

1134
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,460
I probably won't get everything.

1135
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,880
Like this one, yeah I see how it is.

1136
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,520
I see it.

1137
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,300
For endings I don't...

1138
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:39,080
mind trying to get them all but if I'm like okay let's move on then I will just move on.

1139
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,400
That's the toxoplasmosis talking.

1140
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:45,940
You know what?

1141
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:46,740
And I love that.

1142
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,600
I loved being toxic.

1143
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,740
I love being toxic.

1144
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,300
But we'll get this one.

1145
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,260
Because I want to snap his neck.

1146
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:58,460
What if I just jump on him?

1147
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,800
I'm just going to jump on him.

1148
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,300
I'm surprised we made it that far with the heavy diamond.

1149
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,660
Why didn't we jump on top of him?

1150
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,520
What?

1151
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,340
Snap neck.

1152
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,150
I told you man.

1153
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,010
I told you about stairs.

1154
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:35,190
What is...Is this a...Oh gosh.

1155
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:42,610
I know the stairs meme but I don't actually know what it's from.

1156
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:44,890
Is it a Homestuck thing?

1157
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,750
I warned you about the stairs bro or whatever.

1158
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:49,270
What is it from?

1159
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:52,550
It is a Homestuck reference?

1160
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:55,530
I've never read Homestuck.

1161
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:58,750
I never read it.

1162
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:03,530
I literally know...I know that they're grey and that they have...

1163
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:04,410
What's it called?

1164
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:09,990
They have like Capricorn symbols for their names or whatever.

1165
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,270
I never read it.

1166
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:17,310
Oh well.

1167
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:19,770
Oh, whoops.

1168
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,050
Wait.

1169
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,190
OK, we'll get the rifle one.

1170
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:22,510
I was just going to keep going but...

1171
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:24,390
Put your hands up!

1172
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:28,250
This is literally me playing any FPS.

1173
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:32,430
Man, those first person shooters make it look so easy.

1174
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:39,090
How could you miss?

1175
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,430
How could you miss?

1176
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,670
He was right in front of you.

1177
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:44,330
OK, this was the...

1178
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:48,370
This was the unseen burglar and just plain epic.

1179
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:50,110
We'll go with the unseen burglar.

1180
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:51,650
OK, so wait.

1181
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:52,870
How do I...

1182
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:54,370
Go to here.

1183
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:55,270
Wait.

1184
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:58,310
Or should we try this one?

1185
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:02,070
We'll try this one because we are here.

1186
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:03,990
Damn it Rio.

1187
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:05,150
True.

1188
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:06,630
It's not me.

1189
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:07,570
It's Rio.

1190
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,230
Cats are the best conversation partners.

1191
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:11,370
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1192
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,290
Jump.

1193
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:14,810
Jump.

1194
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:18,230
Did that work?

1195
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:21,410
Jumping off a spinning vehicle.

1196
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,250
We're going to ram.

1197
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:30,930
How?

1198
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:40,290
How recent is this game?

1199
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:44,710
Isn't Dot Boy pretty recent all things considered?

1200
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:50,430
Basket.

1201
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,490
It's kind of heavy though.

1202
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:54,470
There we go.

1203
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:01,270
I thought this game was from 2005.

1204
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:04,330
2016.

1205
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,090
No, I feel like... Compared to Shoop Da Whoop?

1206
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:10,670
Compared to Shoop Da Whoop?

1207
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:15,350
That meme is way more recent than Shoop Da Whoop.

1208
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:16,450
Excuse me?

1209
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:17,810
It came out in 2020.

1210
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,110
Oh, they updated some stuff for the remake.

1211
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:21,850
OK, OK.

1212
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:26,430
You can't be like...

1213
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:26,990
Oh mint.

1214
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:28,170
Oh my gosh.

1215
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,710
That boy was so old.

1216
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:36,710
No, compared to the other memes in here...

1217
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:42,070
It's my birthday but can I get a baby got back instead of happy birthday?

1218
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:44,070
Sure!

1219
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:46,590
Baby got back!

1220
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,590
The book...

1221
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:01,690
They are talking about the same thing as before.

1222
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,290
Happy Birthday!

1223
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:13,390
Oh my God!

1224
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:14,330
Rock!

1225
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:20,740
Upside down!

1226
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,780
Boss, get down!

1227
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,480
Oh my God, we are killing it.

1228
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,400
I'm too good at this game!

1229
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:35,880
I'm too good at this game!

1230
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,940
I'm bribing him?

1231
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:53,320
I deserve a fair trial!

1232
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,680
That boy was a decade ago.

1233
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,140
Enjoy the psychic damage.

1234
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,360
You guys are so stupid.

1235
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,780
You are twisting my words.

1236
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,800
Drive!

1237
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:13,760
OK, one more.

1238
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,500
Diamond.

1239
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,280
That guy was just going to shoot me regardless.

1240
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,580
OK, we made it!

1241
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,120
We made it?

1242
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,340
Intruder on a scooter.

1243
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:37,610
Alright, we are just going to go from here.

1244
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,970
Because there is...oh wait.

1245
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,250
Nevermind, I thought there was 20 more that we would have to do.

1246
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:44,630
But we got all the endings so we are good.

1247
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:48,430
Amogus.

1248
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:50,610
This is the Amogus area.

1249
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:07,050
The Toppat Clan.

1250
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:19,350
Was that me?

1251
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:34,070
Wait, I remember Charlie!

1252
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,910
It's up to you.

1253
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:38,530
Find a way to bring him down and you'll be a free man.

1254
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:47,530
Sticky hand!

1255
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,150
Yo, that worked.

1256
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:55,250
That worked.

1257
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:00,350
Oh my gosh, I hate this thing in Amogus.

1258
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,610
Ball and chain.

1259
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,370
I think I did it though.

1260
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:10,590
I stole their money.

1261
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,390
Wait, this is actually working.

1262
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,440
I spedrun.

1263
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:26,520
No!

1264
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,040
It's still a fail.

1265
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,160
It's still a fail.

1266
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,980
I was too good.

1267
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,960
Zero point...but we don't want that.

1268
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,600
We don't want this, right?

1269
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:48,960
Wait, I need to get out of here because...

1270
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:51,960
Wait...

1271
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:54,460
Do I go back here?

1272
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:55,920
Oh 2 out of 2, yeah.

1273
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:01,940
Cannonball earpiece.

1274
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:10,960
OK.

1275
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:15,340
Oh, C4 baby.

1276
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:18,880
And...blow up!

1277
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:21,900
We stick to what we know.

1278
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,540
Nevermind.

1279
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:28,850
We can knock.

1280
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,450
We can...

1281
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:31,430
Excuse me!

1282
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:32,610
Hello!

1283
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,350
They probably would have let you in if you had Girl Scout cookies.

1284
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,270
I was thinking like yesterday.

1285
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:42,010
I was like, I want thin mints.

1286
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,650
I want thin mints so bad!

1287
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:47,670
When do the Girl Scouts sell the cookies?

1288
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:50,030
OK.

1289
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:57,030
The vacuum is clearly the answer.

1290
01:13:58,150 --> 01:13:59,130
What is it sucking up?

1291
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:04,390
Hang on.

1292
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:16,300
Disgusting.

1293
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,400
I got him!

1294
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:24,740
Disguise?

1295
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:25,520
Glue?

1296
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:33,980
Or Transdimensionalizer.

1297
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:35,360
What does this do?

1298
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:39,520
Visit alternate dimensions with the flick of a switch.

1299
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,740
It's super easy to use and gives awesome results.

1300
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,580
I'd trust that guy with my life.

1301
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,520
We went to the first dimension!

1302
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:50,580
Oh my gosh!

1303
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,200
That's even beyond me!

1304
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,040
I'm two dimensions!

1305
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,540
Let's flip the switch up to get back to it.

1306
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,200
Alright.

1307
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,900
That's 1D debut.

1308
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:06,760
Glue.

1309
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,640
Glue.

1310
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:21,200
I don't like the sound.

1311
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,680
Oh my gosh!

1312
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,640
Among us sounds.

1313
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,940
Yes please!

1314
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,200
Tails!

1315
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,400
Or Charles.

1316
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,180
I like Tails.

1317
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,600
Get out!

1318
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:50,500
Oh god.

1319
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,040
Mind control.

1320
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,400
Bone melt?

1321
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,940
Oh my gosh!

1322
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,220
Thank you!

1323
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,500
Wait that actually worked!

1324
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,220
Spook him!

1325
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,480
I can't believe that worked again.

1326
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:31,440
I'm speed running.

1327
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:32,620
I'm too good at this!

1328
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,660
I'm too good at this you guys.

1329
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,280
Oh gosh.

1330
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,720
I don't need your help.

1331
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:54,550
I don't need your help.

1332
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:57,670
We made it.

1333
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:58,330
Oh great.

1334
01:16:58,570 --> 01:16:58,950
Awesome.

1335
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,550
Make animal noise.

1336
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,020
Wow I didn't die though.

1337
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:14,920
Reroute the power.

1338
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,100
Because if we shut off the power the whole thing is gonna...

1339
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,920
You're gonna kill a bunch of people.

1340
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,100
That's fine.

1341
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:29,110
We killed his hobby.

1342
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:32,310
We killed his hopes and his dreams.

1343
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:52,030
Just jump.

1344
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:52,730
You'll make it.

1345
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:53,410
Oh nevermind.

1346
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,190
Just trust your instincts Henry!

1347
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:01,910
Banana.

1348
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:11,770
Banana!

1349
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:13,370
What is this a reference to?

1350
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:14,030
Worms?

1351
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:16,490
Oh I don't know if I played worms.

1352
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:17,590
What?

1353
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,430
There was worms...

1354
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:22,010
Something right?

1355
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:22,410
Recently?

1356
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,780
Click on the banana?

1357
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:29,580
Click the red text?

1358
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:34,120
What happened?

1359
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:51,060
Sleeping gas.

1360
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,460
Good job Charles.

1361
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,240
You snooze you lose.

1362
01:18:59,240 --> 01:18:59,820
What?

1363
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,220
The last one is a force gun.

1364
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:16,670
See ya.

1365
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,810
That was so smooth.

1366
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:23,170
That was so smooth.

1367
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:28,690
Rank government supported private investigator.

1368
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:32,370
Infamous Top Hat clan has been apprehended.

1369
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:34,030
Hundreds of arrests made.

1370
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,610
Many still at large.

1371
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:38,650
Authorities tipped off by anonymous source.

1372
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:45,150
1 out of... Oh my gosh 60 fails.

1373
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:47,770
1 out of 4 unique endings.

1374
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:48,450
We can go back.

1375
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:49,990
Let's see.

1376
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,470
Look at this.

1377
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:56,530
I was too good.

1378
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:59,530
I was way too good at this game.

1379
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:04,570
Wait, there is even more here that we didn't do.

1380
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:05,570
Let's try the cannonball.

1381
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:09,730
That's us?

1382
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,070
Oh you can see the shot.

1383
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:20,130
This guy is dead.

1384
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:21,790
Laser!

1385
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:26,490
Oh, just kidding.

1386
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:28,850
It's fine.

1387
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,590
We were in a ball.

1388
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,070
Newton's third law.

1389
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:41,050
I don't... I don't... I've never read physics!

1390
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,020
Oh yeah.

1391
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,280
Super monkey ball.

1392
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:59,750
Yeah, if you don't read you never have to worry about it.

1393
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:02,150
Oh my gosh.

1394
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:02,890
Spikes!

1395
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,330
Wait, I don't think that will help us.

1396
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:09,310
Defensive mode.

1397
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:10,410
Good move.

1398
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:11,190
Good choice.

1399
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:14,370
Eject!

1400
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:14,950
Nice!

1401
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:18,490
Run, run, run Henry!

1402
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:25,530
Matrix... Metal Fist!

1403
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:29,290
Punch, punch, punch!

1404
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:30,010
Oh,

1405
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:39,550
I thought you were an actual spammer.

1406
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:42,250
Sorry, I put you in timeout because I thought you were spamming.

1407
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:46,630
Please don't spam.

1408
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:54,750
Please don't... You guys, I'm... You can see that I'm getting to the... I'm getting most, if not all the endings, so...

1409
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:59,290
Try not to spam for stuff for me to do.

1410
01:21:59,470 --> 01:21:59,870
Thank you.

1411
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,310
I'm not even gonna pick the beans.

1412
01:22:10,450 --> 01:22:10,690
Sorry.

1413
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:19,270
Oh, I have to pick the beans.

1414
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:21,390
You got lucky this time, I guess.

1415
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,720
No more quick time events.

1416
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,080
Oops,

1417
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:53,810
I forgot to get that guy.

1418
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:02,100
You guys spammed my chat over a fart joke?

1419
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,520
Over a fart joke?

1420
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:09,120
That's what you wanted to see so badly?

1421
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:18,320
And it was the only answer I could do to move forward.

1422
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,240
So I would have had to pick it.

1423
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:28,880
Oh my god.

1424
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:35,680
I'm talking to the... Sorry, I know there's like a bunch of people here.

1425
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,620
More than the four people that...

1426
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,060
That spammed the chat.

1427
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,420
It was all such... So many spammers in such a short amount of time.

1428
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,120
You wouldn't get it.

1429
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,180
This is too high-Q.

1430
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,000
This is too much.

1431
01:23:56,660 --> 01:24:03,380
How could you not understand the perfect comedic genius that was the fart joke of the beans?

1432
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:10,120
I thought we were gonna get like a true... This was like a worse...

1433
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:12,920
What's his name?

1434
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:13,600
Oh my gosh.

1435
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,060
The guy that eats the spinach.

1436
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:18,160
Popeye!

1437
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:21,800
I thought we were gonna get a Popeye moment.

1438
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,220
Metal bend.

1439
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,520
With our psychic energy.

1440
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,440
Oh yeah!

1441
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:29,980
Too much bend.

1442
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:34,480
We are... You are a bender Harry.

1443
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:39,780
Robo pants.

1444
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,110
Yeah, kick his ass!

1445
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:52,230
I forgot to wear the harness.

1446
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:55,230
Oh Henry, you are so pathetic.

1447
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,990
I keep forgetting I got this guy.

1448
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:07,130
Yo-yo!

1449
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:17,290
Bash!

1450
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:18,870
Henry attacks!

1451
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,280
500!

1452
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:26,720
Oh my god, no Henry!

1453
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,620
How did you die so badly?

1454
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,540
What did you expect hitting him with a yo-yo would do?

1455
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:38,720
I guess we'll use...

1456
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:47,040
You either pick one game or the other.

1457
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,080
Magic!

1458
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,040
Reflect.

1459
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,700
Oh he does reflect.

1460
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,260
I do fire.

1461
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:54,800
Wait, Henry no!

1462
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:05,020
Let's go back to Final Fantasy.

1463
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,840
What tools we got?

1464
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:12,420
Chainsaw!

1465
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,780
What's happening?

1466
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:21,880
Hello?

1467
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,240
Unpack a chainsaw.

1468
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,040
Should have kept you locked up.

1469
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,260
Glider jet boots.

1470
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,660
Here is our Popeye's mode.

1471
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:46,440
Oh shit!

1472
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:54,710
This is what Popeye has to do every time he inflates his arms.

1473
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:59,370
The glider seems too safe.

1474
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:01,150
Something is going to happen.

1475
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:08,830
Oh no!

1476
01:27:17,490 --> 01:27:19,330
I missed that one guy against the wall.

1477
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,590
He was looking so cool.

1478
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:33,770
Dummies?

1479
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,420
What the?

1480
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,280
We trapped them!

1481
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,220
You think they are alright?

1482
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,400
Pretty big fall.

1483
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,320
I'm sure Henry had a plan.

1484
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:53,610
We double crossed him!

1485
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,700
I'm the big cheese now!

1486
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:17,680
OK, let's see.

1487
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:20,700
But that's not canon, is it?

1488
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,540
Of the Henry lore.

1489
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:25,960
It's not canon.

1490
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,420
Is there going to be one more branch down here?

1491
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,140
Oh wait, 0 out of 2.

1492
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:41,280
Wait, where is the tank?

1493
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,620
It's technically canon.

1494
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,200
All endings are canon.

1495
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,920
Oh it's the Newgrounds tank!

1496
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:53,940
No way!

1497
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:55,740
Yeah, take him.

1498
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,300
What is this?

1499
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,160
Jefferson Smithsonian!

1500
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,700
We are free!

1501
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:09,420
Wow!

1502
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,480
Relentless Bounty Hunter!

1503
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:15,460
2013?

1504
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:23,520
Wait, what?

1505
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:30,220
Is that what it said?

1506
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:32,080
The pardon said 2013.

1507
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:32,300
2013.

1508
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,020
All crimes prior to 2013.

1509
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:42,960
What year is it?

1510
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,980
Everybody change the clocks on your computer!

1511
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:47,560
We can all pretend it's 2013 today.

1512
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,900
I mean, this game makes me feel that way anyway.

1513
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,520
It's still...

1514
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,100
Oh I see!

1515
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:59,180
So if I...

1516
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,660
That's why there is the top hat and the little general hat here.

1517
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,480
So if I do this, it's on their side.

1518
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:06,780
If I do this, it's on their side.

1519
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:07,920
I see!

1520
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:08,200
I see!

1521
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:08,560
I see!

1522
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,880
Oh damn!

1523
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,020
Just that shot took down the entire plane?

1524
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,080
OK.

1525
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:24,220
Parachute.

1526
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,440
This will definitely have the parachute in it though.

1527
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:29,900
100%

1528
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:33,660
Oopsie.

1529
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,000
Butterfingers.

1530
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,540
Oh no, Henry!

1531
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:45,100
Let's see, what are these ones that I spedrun?

1532
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:46,700
Then there is even more here.

1533
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,060
We didn't do the grapple gun.

1534
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,900
This is weird!

1535
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:55,700
This is weird!

1536
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,120
You do the phone.

1537
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,260
What's a joy buzzer?

1538
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:07,860
See ya.

1539
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:09,660
Expanding phone.

1540
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,080
Oh OK.

1541
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,120
I think it said do not shake.

1542
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,480
I don't see that.

1543
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,580
I literally can't read.

1544
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:20,820
We're gonna wait.

1545
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,620
OK, I'm sure.

1546
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:27,920
I got it.

1547
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:29,600
I got his ass.

1548
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,600
Oh damn that worked.

1549
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,820
I got a key!

1550
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,200
What does that do?

1551
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,200
Computer, elevator, vent?

1552
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:39,620
Wait is this...it's not actually me.

1553
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:40,820
Incriminating evidence?

1554
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,960
Civ 5!

1555
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,580
No!

1556
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:46,240
Henry!

1557
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:46,400
Henry!

1558
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:49,960
Henry!

1559
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:59,160
OK This is in true Among Us fashion.

1560
01:31:59,280 --> 01:31:59,960
We are venting.

1561
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:04,520
Oh yeah, too real.

1562
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,140
Oh we made it to the records!

1563
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,700
Oh nevermind, we want to get to the other side.

1564
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:17,340
OK, the teleporter will be real this time.

1565
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,460
Got a sense of that SpongeBob world.

1566
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:41,320
Future!

1567
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:42,120
Future!

1568
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,700
Stretch Chewies.

1569
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,200
This makes me want some though.

1570
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:48,120
Sounds yummy.

1571
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:51,320
Oh!

1572
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:52,540
Oh god!

1573
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,440
It really grinds my gears.

1574
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,480
Magic Pencil?

1575
01:32:59,560 --> 01:32:59,880
OK

1576
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,020
Why did you draw a nut shot?

1577
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:13,280
Why would you create...why is there a thing called a nut shot crawler?

1578
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:15,380
Why does that even exist?

1579
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:16,920
I guess we are leaping.

1580
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:18,480
Leap of faith baby!

1581
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:29,020
Oh I got this guy.

1582
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:29,380
That's right.

1583
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:31,120
Can we let him out?

1584
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:36,680
I got the key!

1585
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:38,060
Oh my god!

1586
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:41,620
You're welcome!

1587
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:48,640
Wizard magic!

1588
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,780
I know one...oh we rolled a one.

1589
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,800
I was gonna say we know one spell.

1590
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,480
Dang it.

1591
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,220
Paperizer?

1592
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,700
Oh it turns us into paper?

1593
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:05,280
Or we are hacking.

1594
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,000
What are you doing?

1595
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:25,770
We got lol jumpscared.

1596
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:27,230
It's quite shocking.

1597
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:29,530
I'm glad it's not in your current...

1598
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:30,150
Oh wait.

1599
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:32,190
I'm glad I'm not in your current situation.

1600
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:35,030
I bet you can't wait to go...

1601
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:42,510
lol everybody lol I feel like the paperizer is the correct answer so I'm gonna do the retro glove.

1602
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:48,770
You look like an idiot.

1603
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:57,590
They got our bad side.

1604
01:34:57,790 --> 01:34:58,270
Oh no!

1605
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:00,910
There he goes.

1606
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:01,810
How did he make it?

1607
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:04,470
Who the hell was that?

1608
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:13,100
Gravity manipulator.

1609
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:18,450
Wait, that one launches.

1610
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:20,810
It happened so fast I didn't even see what happened.

1611
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:22,270
Shrink and grow.

1612
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:23,610
We can make it teeny tiny.

1613
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:27,710
Nice.

1614
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:31,730
Oh, I can get these guys.

1615
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:35,650
Nice.

1616
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:42,850
Oopsie.

1617
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:45,270
What?

1618
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:45,330
What?

1619
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:05,510
We almost got sliced and diced in here.

1620
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:06,810
What's the armor?

1621
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:09,150
Is this doomed?

1622
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:13,010
We're Naruto running though.

1623
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:13,930
What the hell?

1624
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:17,930
Oh, it's Fallout.

1625
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:18,910
Okay.

1626
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:20,610
I was gonna say, what the hell?

1627
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:31,780
Totally doomed.

1628
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:32,820
Yeah, this is doomed.

1629
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,200
I mean...

1630
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:37,980
lol

1631
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,040
Okay.

1632
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,200
Yeah, I saw a spy out there.

1633
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,840
Oh, what's this one?

1634
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:56,920
Looks suspicious.

1635
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:01,360
Looks suspicious.

1636
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:01,660
Suspicious.

1637
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:16,630
Oh, oh no!

1638
01:37:17,410 --> 01:37:18,550
That's why I was suspicious?

1639
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:25,220
Oopsie.

1640
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,040
Could not find C program files.

1641
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,140
Half-Life 3 not found.

1642
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:44,060
Pro...Deb.

1643
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:45,340
Sounds sexy.

1644
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:50,000
That anus thief.

1645
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:53,580
Goodbye

1646
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:01,190
Deb.

1647
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:04,710
Why did you choose that?

1648
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:08,630
Oh, that's so sad.

1649
01:38:10,610 --> 01:38:11,010
Okay.

1650
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:14,990
L cut mark 2.

1651
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:18,550
Laser.

1652
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:22,850
Yeah, we can just steal it.

1653
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:24,490
There it goes.

1654
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:28,410
We can just take the ground.

1655
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:31,870
Take our problems and push them somewhere else.

1656
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:32,290
Exactly!

1657
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:33,470
Do you feel like a hero?

1658
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:34,810
Yeah, I am the hero.

1659
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:36,970
I'm the main character!

1660
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:40,590
Oh, I missed one.

1661
01:38:40,650 --> 01:38:40,910
Sorry.

1662
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:43,310
I was too slow.

1663
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:44,990
Oh, I got him.

1664
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,400
There he is.

1665
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:52,560
He's got the ruby.

1666
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:53,520
He's got the ruby.

1667
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:57,180
Oh,

1668
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:02,960
are you just going to leave that there?

1669
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:07,320
I will take that and I will escape.

1670
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:10,800
Let me through.

1671
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:13,340
What is Ken?

1672
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:16,400
Let me through!

1673
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:23,760
That's so true.

1674
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:27,220
But what about our pardon though?

1675
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,660
You're blooded thief!

1676
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:50,480
We got all four.

1677
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:54,860
Oh my gosh, we still have half of the unique fails though.

1678
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:56,780
There are so many in this game.

1679
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:01,320
How many storylines are like... This is what?

1680
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,040
Hold on, I'm just going to go to the menu.

1681
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:05,620
Oh wait, this is it?

1682
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:08,760
Is it just two left?

1683
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:25,370
OK, we can do the other things for this one then.

1684
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,250
Oh wait, can I skip?

1685
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:29,770
Skip, skip, skip.

1686
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:32,290
What do we need to do here?

1687
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:36,210
We'll go with the first one.

1688
01:40:37,390 --> 01:40:39,130
I did glue.

1689
01:40:40,590 --> 01:40:42,390
And did I do this one?

1690
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:44,090
I think so.

1691
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:46,790
We did not do the disguise.

1692
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:03,750
Go ahead.

1693
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:05,090
Don't worry.

1694
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:05,990
I'll tell the chief.

1695
01:41:07,230 --> 01:41:07,350
OK.

1696
01:41:07,730 --> 01:41:08,210
Bye!

1697
01:41:10,590 --> 01:41:12,090
Happy Father's Day!

1698
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:14,990
I wasn't ready to be a dad.

1699
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:16,290
Oh God.

1700
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:16,690
OK.

1701
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:18,810
This one, yeah.

1702
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:20,690
We can do...we'll do Charles last.

1703
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:24,950
Family.

1704
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:29,790
Why do they even have this?

1705
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:32,670
They have...how do they get across?

1706
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:38,810
Why do they even have this gravity bubble?

1707
01:41:41,130 --> 01:41:41,610
As a prank.

1708
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:50,780
You got this Charles.

1709
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:01,040
So wait, does up increase gravity or does it lift you up in the air?

1710
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,400
That's such a good question, actually.

1711
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,920
I think it was being repaired.

1712
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,160
Possibly.

1713
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,280
Alright Charles, do your best or your worst.

1714
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:15,920
Alright Charles!

1715
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:21,620
Charles is here!

1716
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:23,120
He looks so excited to be here.

1717
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,560
He's like I'm in the mission too!

1718
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:27,580
Alright, we did the RoboHut.

1719
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:28,540
Let's go to the next thing.

1720
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:31,020
We did the Bone Melt which I...

1721
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:34,400
I'm really happy that that worked.

1722
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:38,520
Let's do the Gatling Gun.

1723
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:48,540
Hold on, I'm gonna...

1724
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:51,980
Since I can't stop coughing.

1725
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:54,540
Cough drop.

1726
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:03,800
Didn't even hit the door.

1727
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:12,500
The guy was like...dead tongue out body.

1728
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:13,800
So silly.

1729
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:14,460
Mind control!

1730
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:31,370
Controlling another person is harder than it looks.

1731
01:43:32,030 --> 01:43:33,550
Skill issue Charles.

1732
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:34,170
Sorry.

1733
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:36,050
Who was doing the mind control?

1734
01:43:36,050 --> 01:43:38,070
We're hacking.

1735
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:47,690
Wrong subroutine.

1736
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:51,190
Is Minto a master manipulator?

1737
01:43:52,570 --> 01:43:54,010
I will possess him.

1738
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:57,730
This used to be a flash game.

1739
01:43:58,130 --> 01:43:58,430
I know.

1740
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:02,880
I know, I know.

1741
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,200
Next, this one.

1742
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,480
Oh yeah, this one is...

1743
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:10,340
Fraud?

1744
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:11,520
Oh gosh.

1745
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:14,200
I'm gonna let it run out of time first.

1746
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,440
Charlie is the Pequod of this game.

1747
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,400
I know, he's so cute!

1748
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:22,940
This is a good time Charles!

1749
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:26,720
We're supposed to be sneaky!

1750
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:34,460
It's the same thing just flipped.

1751
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:37,160
I wonder what's over here.

1752
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:41,700
Espionage, we have a lot of fraud, espionage, research...

1753
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:44,100
Probably members birthdays.

1754
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:46,120
Poor duck.

1755
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:48,060
Yeah, poor duck.

1756
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:56,640
Ninja style!

1757
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,880
You missed!

1758
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,280
This

1759
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:06,220
is literally...

1760
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:10,460
This is literally what I'm saying all the time.

1761
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:11,640
You missed!

1762
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,300
How could you miss?

1763
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:15,520
It was the refrain of my...

1764
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,860
Oh my gosh.

1765
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:22,460
But when I say it...

1766
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:24,280
Yeah, dishonor on you!

1767
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:27,660
Yeah, I'm always quoting Mushu from Mulan.

1768
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,500
You missed!

1769
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:33,460
It's the part when Mulan...

1770
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:35,920
When... What's his name?

1771
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:36,600
Oh gosh.

1772
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:39,620
The bad guy is coming at Mulan.

1773
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,060
And...

1774
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:45,840
And she shoots the rocket.

1775
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,240
But he was right there.

1776
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:49,340
Dishonor on you!

1777
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:50,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1778
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:52,560
She shoots it.

1779
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,740
And Mushu is on it.

1780
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:55,800
He's like, you missed!

1781
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,240
Yeah, the mountain scene, exactly!

1782
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:01,380
Yeah, she causes the avalanche instead of hitting him.

1783
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:02,540
And kills him.

1784
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:07,560
Mulan is so fun.

1785
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,620
I love quoting that scene.

1786
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,500
Falcon kick!

1787
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:22,900
I think you put too much energy into it that time.

1788
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:24,780
What's the balance?

1789
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:26,900
No energy and we don't do anything.

1790
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:28,500
Too much energy and we get that.

1791
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:30,840
The Huns, Mulan.

1792
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:31,520
The Huns.

1793
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:34,420
OK, I think that's all of them there.

1794
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,380
Let's turn off the ship, baby!

1795
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,360
Let's hope the landing gear still has power.

1796
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,520
Alrighty, and that's all of them for that round.

1797
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,720
Look at us, we're too good.

1798
01:46:59,260 --> 01:46:59,880
Now this one.

1799
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:00,760
What?

1800
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:01,920
OK, we did the laser?

1801
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:04,220
I think.

1802
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:05,860
Did we not do the thruster?

1803
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:12,610
I thought we would have more thrust.

1804
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:14,430
Thruster?

1805
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:16,050
I hardly even know her.

1806
01:47:17,450 --> 01:47:20,250
You know, I really expected you to go faster with those thrusters.

1807
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:23,770
OK, we got 2 of 2 there.

1808
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:24,250
So here...

1809
01:47:26,150 --> 01:47:26,550
Boost!

1810
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:33,630
Gotta go fast!

1811
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:35,930
That was a lack of thrust.

1812
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:36,790
Miento!

1813
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:38,010
Sorry.

1814
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:39,590
I had to!

1815
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:40,610
The joke was right.

1816
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:41,990
What do you mean negative 2?

1817
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:43,110
That was a good one.

1818
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:46,270
Eject!

1819
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:47,790
Oh wait!

1820
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:49,190
I forgot what scene we were in.

1821
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:52,610
Wait!

1822
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:53,350
I did it!

1823
01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:54,730
I did it correctly.

1824
01:47:54,910 --> 01:47:55,730
I'm too good at the game.

1825
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:01,770
OK, we can go back now.

1826
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:02,970
Here we go.

1827
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:05,790
Dang it!

1828
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:06,610
I did the same thing!

1829
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:09,790
I have to let it run out of time.

1830
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:10,990
I have to let it run out of time.

1831
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:11,430
Here we go.

1832
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:15,820
Bounce!

1833
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:16,440
Bounce!

1834
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,560
Oh that thing was colossal!

1835
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:23,300
Oh is that a face?

1836
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:25,260
I thought it was underpants.

1837
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:29,860
Huh?

1838
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:33,440
I think these are eyebrows and these are eyes and then it's laughing.

1839
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:35,300
It looks like underpants though, doesn't it?

1840
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:37,840
Same?

1841
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,300
It looks like underpants!

1842
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:48,640
Oopsie!

1843
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,260
OK, we got all those.

1844
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,020
Oh this one!

1845
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,420
This one will be good because there are so many.

1846
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:57,360
Actually I'm going to save it.

1847
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:58,440
We'll save it as the last thing.

1848
01:48:58,600 --> 01:48:59,000
Jet boots.

1849
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:05,740
Still a ponzo expert.

1850
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:09,180
Jet books... Jet books?

1851
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:10,860
Jet boots?

1852
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:12,240
Production notes.

1853
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:15,900
Find lighter material to construct boots out of.

1854
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:16,900
Nice.

1855
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:18,240
Alright.

1856
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,360
We shall do the Final Fantasy so far.

1857
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:23,240
Jet books.

1858
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:26,480
Combine boots and production.

1859
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:29,960
Like Captain Underpants?

1860
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:30,920
Yeah!

1861
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:32,080
Like Captain Underpants.

1862
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:35,800
Bombs?

1863
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:42,640
Ripperoni.

1864
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:44,740
Out of all those options you chose fight?

1865
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:45,640
How boring.

1866
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:50,140
Only for the 100%.

1867
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:53,980
What is Blitz?

1868
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:55,660
Suplex?

1869
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:02,210
Chain Gun!

1870
01:50:03,690 --> 01:50:04,550
Oh come on!

1871
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:07,810
I thought for sure that would have done it.

1872
01:50:08,630 --> 01:50:12,350
OK, now we just need to go... We do the Heal Heal.

1873
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:18,410
Yeah, we lost elite amount of points.

1874
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:20,650
Amount of elite damage.

1875
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:26,630
It worked on the train.

1876
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:38,480
I like these discount versions of the songs.

1877
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,420
They are pretty good though.

1878
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:41,940
What did I do before?

1879
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:42,920
Defend?

1880
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:43,740
I think I did.

1881
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:45,660
Let's do goods.

1882
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:47,620
Multi-bottle rocket!

1883
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:55,390
Good BGM.

1884
01:50:55,670 --> 01:50:55,890
No,

1885
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:01,630
I can't say that I've played Earthbound before, I'll be honest.

1886
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:03,270
But obviously I know the reference.

1887
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:07,350
Let's go back.

1888
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:12,730
It's a PSA.

1889
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:14,190
Mint is redacted.

1890
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:14,670
No!

1891
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:16,990
Why would you say that?

1892
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:18,590
To my face?

1893
01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:20,310
How dare you!

1894
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:24,650
Auto fight.

1895
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:25,750
Bash!

1896
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:40,660
Oh wait, did I do that one before?

1897
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:41,820
I don't remember.

1898
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,640
So we got to do defend and saw.

1899
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,540
I could not stop crying.

1900
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,360
Henry cannot take a single hit, Gennie.

1901
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:06,000
Oh Henry, I'd be crying if you flashed me too.

1902
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:12,880
Yes,

1903
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:17,280
Gennie.

1904
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:17,940
So are they!

1905
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:21,160
Defend.

1906
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,300
Swung wildly.

1907
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:23,460
Oh my god!

1908
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:24,320
Oh my god!

1909
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:25,020
Mortal damage!

1910
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:27,100
Oh my god, Henry!

1911
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:28,940
Henry can't take a hit.

1912
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:32,540
The best offense is a good defense.

1913
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:33,540
Somebody unsuccessful.

1914
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:34,400
You know what?

1915
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:38,540
That's how I always played my games, baby.

1916
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:40,880
My things would be total offense.

1917
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:45,300
Like in Pokemon, if something was just like...

1918
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,300
Oh this gives you more...

1919
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:51,120
You know, like Harden or something.

1920
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,640
Nah, only fight.

1921
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:54,920
No defend.

1922
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:57,720
Only fight, no defend.

1923
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:01,960
This one we didn't do.

1924
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:03,240
I was too good at this one too.

1925
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:04,600
Here we go.

1926
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:06,860
Bomb!

1927
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,400
What?

1928
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:15,460
What?

1929
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:18,880
Should've used the remote, but it worked though!

1930
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:23,260
Bomberman.

1931
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:25,060
That game stresses me out.

1932
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,480
Bomberman stresses me out.

1933
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:31,520
So when they were like, oh yeah, Bomberman and new Metal Gear Delta.

1934
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:33,380
I was just like, oh gosh.

1935
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,640
Because you have to ride around so fast and everything.

1936
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:40,760
I'm scared.

1937
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,760
But the girls in it...

1938
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:47,000
are great.

1939
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:50,760
We didn't use the elevator before.

1940
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:55,040
These sound effects make me want to play...

1941
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,800
They make me want to play Among Us.

1942
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:02,660
Should've sworn that was an elevator.

1943
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,620
This one we didn't do.

1944
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:08,680
The claw pack.

1945
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:14,620
What is this a reference to?

1946
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,480
Take care of your bird.

1947
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:19,140
Oh Banjo.

1948
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,360
Banjo Kazooie.

1949
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:22,760
Oh wait.

1950
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:23,500
Ok.

1951
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:25,140
Outer wing.

1952
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:26,520
We did the armor.

1953
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:27,860
We fall out of shells.

1954
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,340
Get green shelled.

1955
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:30,040
Nevermind.

1956
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,040
Wait, what?

1957
01:54:31,660 --> 01:54:34,060
Get green shelled?

1958
01:54:39,190 --> 01:54:39,850
Henry!

1959
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:40,110
Henry!

1960
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:51,290
I'll tell you what.

1961
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:54,010
I'll tell you what.

1962
01:54:54,510 --> 01:54:56,070
I'll tell you what.

1963
01:54:57,790 --> 01:54:58,990
Oh my gosh.

1964
01:54:59,590 --> 01:55:00,750
Ok, you guys.

1965
01:55:00,830 --> 01:55:02,110
I saw a video the other day.

1966
01:55:03,870 --> 01:55:06,470
I don't remember what the context was.

1967
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:09,890
But I was listening to it.

1968
01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:12,230
And I was like, gosh.

1969
01:55:12,430 --> 01:55:15,030
The girl talking in this sounds like Doki.

1970
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:17,890
I was like, she sounds like Doki so much.

1971
01:55:18,010 --> 01:55:19,510
And then I was reading the comments.

1972
01:55:19,730 --> 01:55:21,590
And the comments were just like...

1973
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:25,890
They were making reference saying that the girl sounded like Bobby Hill.

1974
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:28,350
And I was like...

1975
01:55:28,350 --> 01:55:30,270
Does Bobby sound like...

1976
01:55:30,270 --> 01:55:32,430
Wait, does Doki sound like Bobby?

1977
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:35,210
And now...

1978
01:55:39,930 --> 01:55:41,250
I wanna... Hold on.

1979
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:42,970
I'm gonna go listen to... Let's see.

1980
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:45,550
I'm gonna pull up a video.

1981
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:47,610
Ok.

1982
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:50,110
Bobby Hill.

1983
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:52,230
Let's just say... Him saying anything.

1984
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:55,130
This is...

1985
01:55:56,410 --> 01:55:59,410
This is best of Bobby Hill from Adult Swim.

1986
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:02,010
I'm just gonna listen to him say one thing, ok?

1987
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,600
Ok, he's not...

1988
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,960
When he talks, we'll know.

1989
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:15,500
Ok, sorry you can't see it.

1990
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:20,380
I'm too lazy to pull it up for you guys.

1991
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,700
You'll just have to sound only.

1992
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:24,840
Talk, Bobby!

1993
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:30,860
Talk, Bobby!

1994
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:53,260
That's just a Doki clip you're playing.

1995
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:54,760
Oh no!

1996
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,420
Wait, I'm gonna skip.

1997
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:58,380
Ok, let's skip to like here.

1998
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:07,420
If Doki had a southern accent...

1999
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:15,080
I discovered this like... It was like a couple of weeks ago.

2000
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:18,320
And I was like, I have to... I have to tell everybody this.

2001
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,620
I completely forgot.

2002
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:24,780
Now I bestow this cursed knowledge upon you.

2003
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:30,500
It's like Doki's sister is what it sounds like.

2004
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,100
We have Doki at home.

2005
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,880
I didn't know Doki was a guest on this stream too.

2006
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,500
Have you told her?

2007
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:36,860
No.

2008
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:39,980
I didn't.

2009
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:41,540
Ok, let's do the umbrella.

2010
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:50,820
A little kid in a mask from FF10-2 has the same VA as Bobby Hill.

2011
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:52,480
A little kid in a mask?

2012
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,040
I don't remember that kid.

2013
01:57:56,740 --> 01:57:57,700
Merry Poppins!

2014
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,080
Oh god, Merry Poppins!

2015
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,640
We got all the fails.

2016
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:06,460
Shinra?

2017
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:07,840
Oh, Shinra!

2018
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:13,520
I was like, what the heck?

2019
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,220
Kid in a mask?

2020
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,340
I remember Shinra, yeah.

2021
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:19,420
Yay, we got everything!

2022
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:22,880
We didn't get all the people, but that's ok.

2023
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:25,160
Oh my gosh, I got a lot of them.

2024
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:25,740
Never mind.

2025
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:26,740
No, I didn't.

2026
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:29,140
I thought I did.

2027
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:29,840
Wait!

2028
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:32,440
That's Dave Papa.

2029
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:36,660
For one reason or another, he's been captured by the Top Hat Clan and now sits in their brig.

2030
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:40,560
Bordecai Booker.

2031
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:42,520
Kurt Steele.

2032
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:44,440
Mert Steele.

2033
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,780
Otoho, welcome to membership.

2034
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:48,480
Thank you.

2035
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,640
Oh, there we go.

2036
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:52,720
Kent and Ryu.

2037
01:58:54,260 --> 01:58:56,040
I love Ryu.

2038
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:58,780
That guy.

2039
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:04,720
Handsome Harold!

2040
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:06,600
What makes him so handsome?

2041
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:07,420
Hatchman.

2042
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:10,260
Plumb.

2043
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,160
Wait, Plumb.

2044
01:59:16,110 --> 01:59:17,210
Oh no, he's Pampa.

2045
01:59:18,710 --> 01:59:20,170
He's pretty handsome.

2046
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:22,130
Sir Wilford.

2047
01:59:22,710 --> 01:59:23,430
Suave.

2048
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:26,630
What the hell?

2049
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:32,210
TRNK, a failed experiment in resurrecting a long dead leader.

2050
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:34,890
Didn't last long before he turned on everyone.

2051
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:38,530
Mint, have you seen House MD?

2052
01:59:38,770 --> 01:59:39,430
I have.

2053
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:41,690
I have seen House MD.

2054
01:59:42,650 --> 01:59:43,130
Why?

2055
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:46,070
Drunk.

2056
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:49,050
Nice!

2057
01:59:50,370 --> 01:59:52,210
Now we can go...

2058
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:57,830
What was that?

2059
01:59:57,910 --> 01:59:59,790
I don't remember what my favorite ending was for this.

2060
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:02,610
I think it was the...

2061
02:00:02,610 --> 02:00:04,190
True Thief?

2062
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:05,850
One, I think.

2063
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:11,670
Billy G, not my lover.

2064
02:00:13,710 --> 02:00:15,330
The Newgrounds Tank.

2065
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,310
Which one was that?

2066
02:00:17,450 --> 02:00:17,910
This one?

2067
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:24,680
Wait, which one was it?

2068
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:25,880
It wasn't the banana.

2069
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:29,420
No, it was the force...

2070
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:36,520
It wasn't this one.

2071
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:36,980
It's ok.

2072
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:38,380
We already got the other one.

2073
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,440
This one is so smooth though.

2074
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:44,240
It's kind of awesome.

2075
02:00:45,860 --> 02:00:47,760
It's kind of awesome, I'm not going to lie.

2076
02:00:55,470 --> 02:00:57,250
This is the one where we get pardoned, right?

2077
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:06,860
Nice.

2078
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:08,840
Alright, let's go on to the next one.

2079
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:10,340
Fleeing the Complex.

2080
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:13,400
We need Bobby Ducky Hill fanart now.

2081
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:14,900
I know, right?

2082
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:24,220
The wall.

2083
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:29,680
We got pardoned!

2084
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:32,820
Shadow Moses.

2085
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:37,320
No!

2086
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:39,200
I didn't get...

2087
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:40,360
I got him.

2088
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,120
Do not...

2089
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:48,120
What does it say though?

2090
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:48,980
I'm going to play dead.

2091
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,360
It's Grigori.

2092
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:56,060
Grigori!

2093
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:57,440
Can you imagine?

2094
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:59,220
Thank God his name is not Gustav.

2095
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:04,420
Put him with others.

2096
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:06,320
Ok.

2097
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:09,260
No!

2098
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:11,300
Fried Tofu time!

2099
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:12,020
Welcome to my machine.

2100
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:12,620
Thank you.

2101
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:14,600
I don't remember the girl's name.

2102
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:18,820
We're going to boost up.

2103
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,120
Give me up there.

2104
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:21,220
Give me up there girl.

2105
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:21,660
Come on.

2106
02:02:23,460 --> 02:02:24,780
What the hell?

2107
02:02:28,420 --> 02:02:29,340
Go Henry!

2108
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:30,200
Oh my God!

2109
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:36,520
Oh yeah!

2110
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:37,540
Oh yeah!

2111
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:39,340
Wait, what's this?

2112
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:41,340
Come on with!

2113
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,580
Riz a hundred.

2114
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:47,560
Oh I...

2115
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,160
I don't care.

2116
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:53,940
Watching House for the first time is good.

2117
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:55,300
Yeah, I like it.

2118
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:57,920
Is this the one?

2119
02:02:58,060 --> 02:02:59,100
Is this the one?

2120
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:16,880
It worked though.

2121
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:19,000
It worked.

2122
02:03:19,700 --> 02:03:20,320
I suppose.

2123
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:21,680
There it is.

2124
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:22,880
The distraction dance.

2125
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:23,880
Oh my gosh my title.

2126
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:24,520
What?

2127
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:37,000
Sounds like something a Sim would say.

2128
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:42,600
Bounce Bros.

2129
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:45,800
Oh gosh!

2130
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:48,460
We're not the Bounce Bros!

2131
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:53,000
I was about to say something not so nice about her.

2132
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:53,540
But I don't know.

2133
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:58,960
We can never be them.

2134
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:00,700
They have too much coordination.

2135
02:04:03,220 --> 02:04:04,360
Tall guy!

2136
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:05,420
Oh yeah my favorite.

2137
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:08,520
Hey buddy!

2138
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:19,880
Please say it.

2139
02:04:20,120 --> 02:04:22,300
You know the saying Bros before Hoes.

2140
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:26,680
We couldn't be the Bounce Bros.

2141
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:36,560
Minus two.

2142
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:36,980
I know!

2143
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:38,640
That's why I didn't say it!

2144
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:40,580
Gosh!

2145
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:45,140
You can't say minus two when you told me to say it!

2146
02:04:49,060 --> 02:04:50,400
Little Savage welcome to membership.

2147
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:51,300
Thank you!

2148
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:53,260
Nice to meet you.

2149
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:56,720
If we can get you up there, you can get in and open this door.

2150
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:00,600
We're gonna use the force.

2151
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:02,820
Oh god!

2152
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:04,300
She's gonna use the force.

2153
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:08,220
OK That worked, I think.

2154
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:10,180
Wait, that actually worked?

2155
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:14,340
Oh, they are too fast!

2156
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:18,480
They are too fast!

2157
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:20,840
I can't grab them.

2158
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:21,920
How did that work?

2159
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:22,940
Sniper Rifle!

2160
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:25,460
One each and she gets a taser.

2161
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:35,000
Hey, I just grabbed these.

2162
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:36,120
Maybe they will come in handy.

2163
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:43,000
How am I so good at this game?

2164
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:46,900
How am I so good at this game?

2165
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:48,500
Oh my god!

2166
02:05:55,790 --> 02:05:57,530
We're gonna blend in obviously.

2167
02:05:57,530 --> 02:05:58,530
Hold the elevator?

2168
02:05:59,430 --> 02:05:59,870
Thanks.

2169
02:06:00,050 --> 02:06:01,570
Can you believe this inmate operate?

2170
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:02,650
Crazy, huh?

2171
02:06:02,770 --> 02:06:04,070
Yes, it is pretty crazy.

2172
02:06:05,310 --> 02:06:08,650
Oh yeah, we transferred from the 8th floor.

2173
02:06:12,070 --> 02:06:12,670
No!

2174
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:19,170
Not the extra down!

2175
02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:23,310
Oh my god, get LA noired.

2176
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:31,420
I love that that's still like a funny thing.

2177
02:06:31,820 --> 02:06:34,940
Like extra down is still funny to me.

2178
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,820
Just like F to pay respects.

2179
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:40,620
I feel like people don't say F very much anymore though.

2180
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:52,640
The extra down to me at least feels like it hasn't been overused.

2181
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:53,120
You know what I mean?

2182
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:54,100
Like in an unfunny way.

2183
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,820
But F kind of fell off, yeah.

2184
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:01,020
F to pay respects.

2185
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:03,040
F for F to pay respects.

2186
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:04,020
No!

2187
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:08,900
Yeah, F evolved to 07.

2188
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,380
So true, so true.

2189
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:11,860
Venue!

2190
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:13,580
Welcome to Vanbusha, thank you.

2191
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:15,360
Every letter is a meme now.

2192
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:17,520
True.

2193
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,240
What's meme is for?

2194
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:23,600
Oh wait, I was gonna say W.

2195
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:26,480
But it is a meme!

2196
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:28,900
For...

2197
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:33,380
J.

2198
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:38,300
What about J, huh?

2199
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:39,220
J.

2200
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,300
J.

2201
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:43,920
J.

2202
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:45,980
J.

2203
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:50,980
We should, ok guys, let's make J into a funny thing that people type.

2204
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:54,200
We can do it.

2205
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:59,920
We can start the J movement.

2206
02:08:00,180 --> 02:08:02,280
Something happens in chat, you just...

2207
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:04,100
J for Jork!

2208
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:06,840
J for Jork!

2209
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:09,340
Jorking.

2210
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:11,060
No, not Jorking it.

2211
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:11,500
No!

2212
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:13,220
No, no, no.

2213
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:14,900
Who is J-Don?

2214
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:15,880
What is J-Don?

2215
02:08:18,970 --> 02:08:20,110
J for Jorking.

2216
02:08:28,550 --> 02:08:29,990
J-Don my soul.

2217
02:08:33,530 --> 02:08:34,710
I don't know it.

2218
02:08:37,670 --> 02:08:39,570
Oh it's a bae meme.

2219
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:40,950
Ah, ok, ok.

2220
02:08:41,830 --> 02:08:42,810
I don't know it.

2221
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:49,580
I don't know it.

2222
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,640
Happy for you though.

2223
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:55,920
Let's see.

2224
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:56,740
Latosh?

2225
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:01,860
Oh my God!

2226
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:03,480
No!

2227
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,020
We ratted them out.

2228
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:07,760
Oh gosh, there are so many guys here.

2229
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,060
Oh God!

2230
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:17,680
Oh gosh, is this gonna be like a thing to the knee?

2231
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:19,700
Make a face!

2232
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:27,280
It worked!

2233
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:32,360
I'm too good at this game.

2234
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:35,380
I'm too good at this game.

2235
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:36,880
We can go to that guy.

2236
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:39,480
No, this looks...we can...

2237
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:40,720
Wait, is that a bike?

2238
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:42,380
Yeah, take the bike.

2239
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:43,500
No!

2240
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:50,500
She'll come back for me.

2241
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:14,380
I think I'm always too good at this game.

2242
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:15,840
Five endings!

2243
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:17,220
Ok, alright.

2244
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:19,440
Let's start getting some of these other things.

2245
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:22,180
Oh my gosh, I literally only just went down one path.

2246
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:31,480
What if I didn't grab her though?

2247
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,040
Oh no!

2248
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:35,680
Ellie!

2249
02:10:36,900 --> 02:10:41,340
You are now imagining long-haired Vincent Evangelion plucks you.

2250
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:43,160
I don't care.

2251
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:47,960
Command Melody?

2252
02:11:04,630 --> 02:11:08,050
I don't really appreciate that one very much.

2253
02:11:08,850 --> 02:11:09,950
Wind Waker.

2254
02:11:11,890 --> 02:11:14,310
I never actually got to play Wind Waker.

2255
02:11:15,610 --> 02:11:18,050
It was for...

2256
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:25,050
Wind Waker is good.

2257
02:11:27,270 --> 02:11:27,830
Gamecube!

2258
02:11:28,230 --> 02:11:29,470
I didn't have a Gamecube.

2259
02:11:31,090 --> 02:11:33,310
I didn't have a Gamecube, you guys.

2260
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:34,230
That's why.

2261
02:11:34,230 --> 02:11:37,670
I was like, I think it was not on a platform that I had.

2262
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:41,390
I only had a Gamecube like recently.

2263
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:42,730
I got it for...

2264
02:11:43,210 --> 02:11:44,790
I got it for Twin Snakes.

2265
02:11:46,410 --> 02:11:48,890
I only got my Gamecube for Twin Snakes.

2266
02:11:48,910 --> 02:11:50,170
Like very, very recently.

2267
02:11:52,930 --> 02:11:53,370
So...

2268
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:56,210
Unfortunately... Oh wait.

2269
02:11:58,250 --> 02:11:58,690
Pickpocket!

2270
02:11:58,690 --> 02:12:00,790
I ended up buffing up my...

2271
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:02,810
Wait!

2272
02:12:03,070 --> 02:12:04,510
I'm taking everything.

2273
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,810
Oh no!

2274
02:12:08,570 --> 02:12:10,050
Actual Skyrim moment.

2275
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:11,310
Did you really need all that?

2276
02:12:11,410 --> 02:12:12,470
No loot left behind.

2277
02:12:13,570 --> 02:12:16,210
I was told recently to play Skyrim.

2278
02:12:16,870 --> 02:12:18,070
I was like, I think you'll like it.

2279
02:12:19,170 --> 02:12:19,570
Maybe.

2280
02:12:21,270 --> 02:12:22,270
Let's just run.

2281
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:26,490
Was that the convict?

2282
02:12:28,170 --> 02:12:28,570
No...

2283
02:12:28,570 --> 02:12:30,950
That was just to win.

2284
02:12:31,290 --> 02:12:32,210
But I'm a loot goblin.

2285
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:32,930
You guys know that.

2286
02:12:34,590 --> 02:12:35,390
Fake shoot him?

2287
02:12:38,490 --> 02:12:41,230
Oh, I thought he said fake shoot him.

2288
02:12:44,430 --> 02:12:46,190
Like they weren't actually gonna shoot me.

2289
02:12:47,050 --> 02:12:48,230
Ah, I see, I see.

2290
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:50,810
Wait, did we get 3 out of 3 here?

2291
02:12:51,590 --> 02:12:53,050
Oh, of the wrong things, yeah.

2292
02:12:53,050 --> 02:12:55,390
Oh, whoopee cushion with a rock!

2293
02:13:07,450 --> 02:13:09,410
He's strangling that guy out.

2294
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:10,830
He's choking him out.

2295
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:14,790
How do we get up there by ourselves?

2296
02:13:14,910 --> 02:13:15,930
We use the force.

2297
02:13:16,890 --> 02:13:17,910
Power jump?

2298
02:13:17,910 --> 02:13:17,950
Power jump.

2299
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:23,550
Hell yeah!

2300
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:27,610
Oh yeah!

2301
02:13:34,060 --> 02:13:35,520
This will work for sure.

2302
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:41,510
How does this actually work?

2303
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:59,700
We tried the plunger boots before, or rather we did the plungers before.

2304
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:07,060
Helium.

2305
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:13,280
Oh yeah!

2306
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,300
Oh my gosh, Henry, you can do it.

2307
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:17,020
Why didn't he just crawl across?

2308
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:20,480
Wait, is that actually it?

2309
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:22,780
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

2310
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:25,980
Wait!

2311
02:14:32,850 --> 02:14:33,890
Just a box.

2312
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:35,250
No!

2313
02:14:38,090 --> 02:14:39,430
Wait, this is so messed up.

2314
02:14:45,370 --> 02:14:47,490
I wish this actually would happen instead.

2315
02:14:48,170 --> 02:14:48,910
Not gonna lie.

2316
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:52,830
Shadowser?

2317
02:14:56,950 --> 02:14:59,190
The unseen stick is the deadliest.

2318
02:14:59,490 --> 02:14:59,990
Blend in.

2319
02:15:00,170 --> 02:15:00,990
Become a shadow.

2320
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:03,670
I'm gonna be honest with you, this one isn't that great.

2321
02:15:03,810 --> 02:15:04,650
Gotcha game!

2322
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:04,970
No!

2323
02:15:07,570 --> 02:15:08,590
What are you talking about?

2324
02:15:08,630 --> 02:15:09,930
This one might be the most powerful.

2325
02:15:12,450 --> 02:15:13,390
Oh oh, just kidding.

2326
02:15:13,770 --> 02:15:14,190
Oh god.

2327
02:15:17,770 --> 02:15:20,010
Clicking the red shadow here doesn't do anything.

2328
02:15:20,010 --> 02:15:25,010
Now you are but a shadow of your former self.

2329
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:29,630
Mario!

2330
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:37,840
Whatever works, works, right?

2331
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:40,640
A dingy?

2332
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:41,660
A rocket?

2333
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:43,180
SS Annie.

2334
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:44,080
SS Annie!

2335
02:15:45,580 --> 02:15:47,360
What's going on with SS Annie?

2336
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:02,200
Did you think none of the crew would notice an unscheduled departure?

2337
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:06,600
Living Neutral, thank you so much for 10 months!

2338
02:16:07,220 --> 02:16:08,020
So funny.

2339
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:08,640
Let's see.

2340
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,360
Let's go on the rocket.

2341
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:17,580
That's how all my rockets start.

2342
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:19,920
Oh jeez.

2343
02:16:21,220 --> 02:16:21,660
OK.

2344
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:23,200
Yeah, we're fine.

2345
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:26,060
I felt like the dingy would be the option, but...

2346
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:32,060
Someone just leave.

2347
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:33,220
I think it was Smith.

2348
02:16:34,060 --> 02:16:35,800
Probably off to see his family.

2349
02:16:42,940 --> 02:16:43,480
Welcome

2350
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:51,020
to Family Shipping!

2351
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:53,320
Nice.

2352
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:55,320
Nice and nice.

2353
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:55,920
Alright.

2354
02:16:57,440 --> 02:17:01,240
I don't even know which way do we go to get other endings.

2355
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:02,400
It must be through here, right?

2356
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:04,780
To branch out the endings.

2357
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:07,580
I guess we'll start here.

2358
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:09,020
Judo throw.

2359
02:17:09,940 --> 02:17:10,680
Oh, nevermind.

2360
02:17:10,940 --> 02:17:11,940
That was so fast.

2361
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:16,260
We used the force before, so we'll use the gravity tool.

2362
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:18,020
From the beginning?

2363
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:19,000
Oh really?

2364
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:22,780
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

2365
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:24,760
From the beginning here?

2366
02:17:26,140 --> 02:17:27,420
Oh, wait for transfer.

2367
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:30,520
Alright, let's go.

2368
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,140
It's been a while.

2369
02:17:32,140 --> 02:17:33,260
Have a good time.

2370
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:34,260
Thank you!

2371
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:40,780
Fake illness.

2372
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:43,980
Teleporter's gotta work this time.

2373
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:46,180
It's gotta.

2374
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:53,890
Wow!

2375
02:17:58,350 --> 02:17:58,890
GG!

2376
02:17:59,450 --> 02:17:59,910
No!

2377
02:18:01,070 --> 02:18:01,630
RE?

2378
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:05,510
What does that mean?

2379
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:10,780
What is this?

2380
02:18:10,860 --> 02:18:11,460
Starcraft?

2381
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:13,080
Get out of here.

2382
02:18:13,880 --> 02:18:14,900
Oh no, rematch.

2383
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,140
That's messed up!

2384
02:18:20,300 --> 02:18:21,460
Cookie.

2385
02:18:25,220 --> 02:18:26,220
Resident Evil.

2386
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:29,280
How curious.

2387
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,500
Oh let's...

2388
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:35,740
I have COVID.

2389
02:18:36,920 --> 02:18:38,160
I have COVID.

2390
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:47,150
Oh gosh, we are here with all the sickies.

2391
02:18:52,570 --> 02:18:53,070
Ahoy!

2392
02:18:56,950 --> 02:18:58,410
Oh my god.

2393
02:18:58,690 --> 02:18:59,230
Let's see.

2394
02:19:01,690 --> 02:19:03,150
Laser plane?

2395
02:19:07,350 --> 02:19:09,470
That looks like it will work.

2396
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:15,320
Government?

2397
02:19:15,880 --> 02:19:17,040
Top Hat clan.

2398
02:19:18,480 --> 02:19:19,240
Government.

2399
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:23,140
Charlie!

2400
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:29,840
I got pardoned, but I'm still in jail.

2401
02:19:35,490 --> 02:19:36,880
The wall.

2402
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:39,220
Can you come here?

2403
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:43,520
Yeah, I don't mind.

2404
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:53,240
Nice!

2405
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:55,400
Look at all these guys we just grabbed.

2406
02:19:58,780 --> 02:19:59,260
Earthbend.

2407
02:20:06,990 --> 02:20:08,070
I'm too good at this.

2408
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:12,290
Oh no, he can't take a hit.

2409
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:12,790
Wait!

2410
02:20:14,210 --> 02:20:15,810
Why did it become GTA?

2411
02:20:18,790 --> 02:20:21,310
We were doing so well.

2412
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:24,010
Why?

2413
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:27,470
Oh I can flash him!

2414
02:20:28,410 --> 02:20:30,850
I don't really have any clothes on anyway.

2415
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:34,370
Don't cross the references.

2416
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:35,690
I see the wall.

2417
02:20:36,010 --> 02:20:36,730
Oh you are outside?

2418
02:20:36,850 --> 02:20:37,250
Nice.

2419
02:20:38,430 --> 02:20:40,310
I'm right down there.

2420
02:20:42,030 --> 02:20:42,890
Oh him!

2421
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:50,830
OK Charles, go for it.

2422
02:20:55,170 --> 02:20:56,030
He

2423
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:01,110
is so cute.

2424
02:21:02,030 --> 02:21:05,010
What about a mini tiny baby helicopter?

2425
02:21:05,010 --> 02:21:06,870
Yeah, deploy the baby!

2426
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:09,850
He will be like a little mosquito.

2427
02:21:10,010 --> 02:21:10,750
Such a nuisance.

2428
02:21:12,970 --> 02:21:14,250
Or a death trap.

2429
02:21:17,350 --> 02:21:18,050
OK

2430
02:21:27,870 --> 02:21:28,570
Him?

2431
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:31,490
Yeah!

2432
02:21:32,390 --> 02:21:33,130
Get him!

2433
02:21:33,550 --> 02:21:34,310
Oh damn!

2434
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:50,020
Perfection.

2435
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:52,960
Yeah!

2436
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:55,160
3 out of 5.

2437
02:21:55,820 --> 02:22:01,660
I don't know if I'll get all the unique fails for this one because holy cow...

2438
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:06,820
There are so many, but I do want to get more of the...

2439
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:07,980
Like look at this.

2440
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:10,240
I got perfect 3 times in a row.

2441
02:22:10,940 --> 02:22:11,820
I'm kind of cracked.

2442
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:17,080
But...

2443
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:18,660
Does this...

2444
02:22:18,660 --> 02:22:19,340
Oh phone a friend.

2445
02:22:19,440 --> 02:22:22,000
This will branch off one of them at least.

2446
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:26,760
One of the endings at least.

2447
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:27,260
What?

2448
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:31,860
A wall?

2449
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:42,380
OK I think long hair Minto is the smart one.

2450
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:43,460
What are you talking about?

2451
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:44,780
I'm still regular.

2452
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:48,360
Yeah, yeah I'm right here.

2453
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:49,120
Yup.

2454
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:53,400
How do we...

2455
02:22:54,740 --> 02:22:55,220
Undercover.

2456
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:57,300
Wait, would they not know who I am then?

2457
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:58,880
Let's do a neurotoxin.

2458
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:05,460
What is...Oh there it is.

2459
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:13,660
Oh did they forget to hand out your gas mask beforehand?

2460
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:15,240
Oopsie.

2461
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:17,580
Oopsie.

2462
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:20,920
I don't know what the...What's with the drill pot even?

2463
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:22,320
Let's do undercover agent.

2464
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:34,160
He spent 3 years undercover.

2465
02:23:42,140 --> 02:23:45,020
How did they know that I was going to be here?

2466
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:45,880
What is this?

2467
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:49,460
What is this setup that they were planning for?

2468
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:52,160
OK, drill pot I guess.

2469
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:54,280
God, loud.

2470
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:59,460
Get to the airship.

2471
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:05,960
Slingshot.

2472
02:24:11,720 --> 02:24:13,080
Click here for a medal.

2473
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:15,660
Oh, you gotta work for it.

2474
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:16,880
Still seems too easy.

2475
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:18,480
I'm up here now.

2476
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:20,000
I'm down here now.

2477
02:24:20,660 --> 02:24:21,820
How did this happen?

2478
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:22,200
Shrug.

2479
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:23,800
This seems like a good spot to be.

2480
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:24,080
Sure.

2481
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:25,120
How's it going?

2482
02:24:25,260 --> 02:24:25,660
Fine.

2483
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:26,640
Doing the game so far?

2484
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:26,940
Yeah.

2485
02:24:27,580 --> 02:24:28,040
I'm glad.

2486
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:28,600
No problem.

2487
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:30,240
So what should we talk about?

2488
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:33,700
I bet you don't know the capital of Mongolia off the top of your head.

2489
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:37,120
I bet you're just pressing OK without even reading what I'm reading.

2490
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:38,440
This is important.

2491
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:39,300
Don't skip my words.

2492
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:40,500
Dogs have feet.

2493
02:24:41,060 --> 02:24:42,540
Press the sun in the sneaky ending.

2494
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:43,720
What?

2495
02:24:44,020 --> 02:24:44,240
What?

2496
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:44,860
Why?

2497
02:24:45,140 --> 02:24:45,440
What?

2498
02:24:45,640 --> 02:24:45,940
What?

2499
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:47,900
I got tired of that spot.

2500
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:48,260
Good.

2501
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:49,580
This seems nicer maybe.

2502
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:50,740
Which one is correct?

2503
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:52,180
This.

2504
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:53,740
You guessed it right!

2505
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:55,880
I have a confession though.

2506
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:56,180
What?

2507
02:24:56,460 --> 02:24:57,340
They were both correct.

2508
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,500
Will you press the rightmost button?

2509
02:24:59,680 --> 02:24:59,920
No.

2510
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:01,000
You liar!

2511
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:04,340
Don't press this button.

2512
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:04,640
OK.

2513
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:12,040
Sneaky ending, huh?

2514
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:15,320
Sneaky ending, huh?

2515
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:16,740
What was the sneaky ending?

2516
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:19,420
Was it this one?

2517
02:25:23,420 --> 02:25:24,020
Sneak.

2518
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:24,620
Sneaky.

2519
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:26,840
Skip.

2520
02:25:26,900 --> 02:25:27,160
Skip.

2521
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:27,540
Skip.

2522
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:27,880
Skip.

2523
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:29,140
Skip.

2524
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:29,160
Skip.

2525
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:35,400
Wait, can I skip a skip?

2526
02:25:39,620 --> 02:25:40,680
Oh the prison.

2527
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:42,240
This one?

2528
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:43,480
Oh yeah, that's right.

2529
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:44,120
It was this one.

2530
02:25:48,220 --> 02:25:48,660
Skip.

2531
02:25:51,140 --> 02:25:51,580
Skip.

2532
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:53,860
What was the sneaky ending?

2533
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:54,860
Yeah.

2534
02:25:54,960 --> 02:25:55,120
Yeah.

2535
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:55,280
Yeah.

2536
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:55,660
I remember.

2537
02:25:55,820 --> 02:25:56,080
I remember.

2538
02:25:58,040 --> 02:25:59,400
It was the plungers.

2539
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:21,960
There is no sun!

2540
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:24,540
Ah!

2541
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:31,500
Nevermind, I got it.

2542
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:38,280
Nevermind.

2543
02:26:40,700 --> 02:26:42,280
Nevermind, I got it.

2544
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:45,960
Nevermind.

2545
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:47,720
Was it worth it?

2546
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:52,640
Was it worth it?

2547
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:56,160
We didn't do the charge tackle, did I?

2548
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:04,640
Speedjuice!

2549
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:05,580
Sonic!

2550
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:11,760
Too fast for you.

2551
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,020
ZeroYangster, welcome to Mammoth Gaming!

2552
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:17,240
Oh wait, retry?

2553
02:27:26,190 --> 02:27:26,970
I'm scared.

2554
02:27:33,460 --> 02:27:33,960
Item!

2555
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:40,020
Miiiine!

2556
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:41,020
Where is it?

2557
02:27:45,180 --> 02:27:46,840
Sir, I got a message.

2558
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:47,740
Yes, go ahead.

2559
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:51,380
Yeah, it looks like Henry Stickman.

2560
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:52,580
Stickman?

2561
02:27:52,840 --> 02:27:54,920
Yeah, Henry Stickman has escaped.

2562
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:55,460
Me too.

2563
02:27:55,460 --> 02:27:57,040
Maybe I can win though.

2564
02:28:12,920 --> 02:28:13,880
Tank?

2565
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:18,600
Oh I'm fighting the tank?

2566
02:28:19,820 --> 02:28:23,620
Stickmans don't belong in Alaska?

2567
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:24,800
Where are we?

2568
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:29,460
This guy...they both look menacing.

2569
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:30,620
Let's go to the building.

2570
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:35,940
No!

2571
02:28:53,940 --> 02:28:55,500
Freddy's Fazbear!

2572
02:28:56,340 --> 02:28:57,680
No way!

2573
02:28:59,160 --> 02:29:00,580
OK, oh gosh.

2574
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:04,820
TKO

2575
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:09,980
We got punch out.

2576
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:12,500
Wait, I gotta get this guy in my...there we go.

2577
02:29:17,770 --> 02:29:18,950
Alright, to here?

2578
02:29:21,570 --> 02:29:22,050
Oh

2579
02:29:25,530 --> 02:29:26,190
my God!

2580
02:29:26,230 --> 02:29:27,150
We just murdered him!

2581
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:31,570
Oops He's up here somewhere.

2582
02:29:36,190 --> 02:29:36,670
Huskwin!

2583
02:29:36,750 --> 02:29:37,950
Welcome to my bushes!

2584
02:29:39,370 --> 02:29:39,850
Costume

2585
02:29:45,890 --> 02:29:47,850
These guys need to chill.

2586
02:29:48,530 --> 02:29:49,410
No way!

2587
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:50,730
They killed Frosty?

2588
02:29:50,810 --> 02:29:51,650
What is Frosty?

2589
02:29:51,730 --> 02:29:53,410
OK, what is he in for?

2590
02:29:54,610 --> 02:29:56,650
What could Frosty...

2591
02:29:57,490 --> 02:29:57,970
Why?

2592
02:30:03,230 --> 02:30:04,730
You don't wanna know.

2593
02:30:06,310 --> 02:30:07,450
You don't wanna know.

2594
02:30:07,530 --> 02:30:08,250
Tax evasion?

2595
02:30:08,410 --> 02:30:09,270
War crimes.

2596
02:30:11,790 --> 02:30:12,750
A sandwich.

2597
02:30:20,700 --> 02:30:23,200
This happens to me too everytime I eat a sandwich.

2598
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:25,500
Not that though.

2599
02:30:25,540 --> 02:30:26,220
I always win.

2600
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:31,040
Castle Crashers.

2601
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:32,460
Oh really?

2602
02:30:33,340 --> 02:30:34,200
Wait, TF2?

2603
02:30:37,540 --> 02:30:38,620
Castle Crashers?

2604
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:39,760
I thought I played that before.

2605
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:43,200
Horizontal.

2606
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:44,020
Now welcome.

2607
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:45,000
Thank you for the 10 gift cards.

2608
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:46,080
Thank you so much!

2609
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:51,220
They hate you.

2610
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:53,600
Kinda both I guess.

2611
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:57,460
This one weird trick will make you super buff.

2612
02:30:57,820 --> 02:30:59,180
Weightlifters hate him!

2613
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:02,840
Frosty is probably in for arson.

2614
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:03,280
No!

2615
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:05,520
I believe that.

2616
02:31:06,820 --> 02:31:07,700
I believe that actually.

2617
02:31:18,470 --> 02:31:19,070
Fail!

2618
02:31:19,750 --> 02:31:20,510
See ya!

2619
02:31:21,470 --> 02:31:22,650
Oh wait, I think...

2620
02:31:27,550 --> 02:31:28,610
I committed.

2621
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:31,470
I committed and I regretted it.

2622
02:31:31,530 --> 02:31:32,530
Dictator Cherry!

2623
02:31:32,930 --> 02:31:33,510
Welcome to the membership.

2624
02:31:33,590 --> 02:31:34,810
So many new members today!

2625
02:31:34,990 --> 02:31:35,850
Thank you guys!

2626
02:31:36,050 --> 02:31:37,490
Alright, we got this time.

2627
02:31:37,790 --> 02:31:38,510
We got this time.

2628
02:31:39,470 --> 02:31:40,450
Oh shoot!

2629
02:31:41,830 --> 02:31:45,470
Eyes on the road buddy!

2630
02:31:55,630 --> 02:31:56,230
Slam!

2631
02:31:56,230 --> 02:31:56,830
Jam!

2632
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:58,270
Japan!

2633
02:32:10,590 --> 02:32:13,190
I'm gonna wait it out first.

2634
02:32:14,130 --> 02:32:15,730
Oh airbag.

2635
02:32:16,030 --> 02:32:16,830
Surrender.

2636
02:32:18,690 --> 02:32:20,350
More things are showing up.

2637
02:32:20,450 --> 02:32:20,970
That's so interesting.

2638
02:32:25,430 --> 02:32:26,370
See ya!

2639
02:32:28,390 --> 02:32:34,150
OK No way!

2640
02:32:36,250 --> 02:32:37,870
No way!

2641
02:32:37,970 --> 02:32:38,870
The patience test.

2642
02:32:39,110 --> 02:32:39,390
What?

2643
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:52,580
Oh my gosh we are in...

2644
02:32:52,580 --> 02:32:54,120
It's a...

2645
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:57,300
Glory to Artstotzka!

2646
02:32:58,020 --> 02:32:59,900
Glory to Artstotzka!

2647
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:01,680
We got papers pleased.

2648
02:33:02,380 --> 02:33:04,120
There is still one more ending.

2649
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:08,300
Oh my gosh, we have only just reached half the unique fails.

2650
02:33:08,540 --> 02:33:10,600
I wanna try...

2651
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:12,680
Not the helipad.

2652
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:14,820
The one we just did.

2653
02:33:14,980 --> 02:33:15,820
The cliffside wreck.

2654
02:33:15,860 --> 02:33:17,780
I wanna see what the other ones do in this part.

2655
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:20,260
Since you just kind of waited it out.

2656
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:22,240
Oh the top hat!

2657
02:33:24,220 --> 02:33:26,720
How did I... Let's try the warp star.

2658
02:33:29,220 --> 02:33:30,020
Oh god!

2659
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:32,320
No!

2660
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:37,300
Such a slow day at work having fun lurking here.

2661
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:38,140
Thank you!

2662
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:39,920
Jerry!

2663
02:33:40,300 --> 02:33:41,620
Thank you so much for the 20 gift.

2664
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:42,660
Thank you so much.

2665
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:44,260
I think I missed some more.

2666
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:48,220
Welcome back everybody who came back to membership.

2667
02:33:48,440 --> 02:33:49,300
Thank you very much.

2668
02:33:49,880 --> 02:33:51,420
Thank you, thank you.

2669
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:01,060
We are gonna wait.

2670
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:02,560
Airbag.

2671
02:34:05,360 --> 02:34:07,100
Airbags save lives.

2672
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:09,880
That was so anticlimactic.

2673
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:13,380
He is very impressed.

2674
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:15,540
He is so impressed.

2675
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:17,000
This is the end for you.

2676
02:34:17,360 --> 02:34:18,860
We got two options here Henry.

2677
02:34:20,900 --> 02:34:22,580
Thank you for the 10 gift.

2678
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:23,560
Alright, surrender!

2679
02:34:25,620 --> 02:34:26,820
We are going back home.

2680
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:31,260
Oh, we are going back to solitary.

2681
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:32,940
Maximum security.

2682
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:34,180
What an honor.

2683
02:34:35,400 --> 02:34:38,220
Alright, so it was the airship, right?

2684
02:34:40,020 --> 02:34:43,260
What did I... Oh that's right, because I...

2685
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:47,200
Slingshot and then it was that whole long thing, right?

2686
02:34:47,860 --> 02:34:48,800
That's a magnet.

2687
02:34:53,930 --> 02:34:54,570
Pretty!

2688
02:34:56,590 --> 02:34:57,810
Thank you so much for the 50 gift.

2689
02:34:57,870 --> 02:34:58,630
Thank you!

2690
02:34:59,430 --> 02:35:00,390
Holy moly.

2691
02:35:00,630 --> 02:35:01,870
Yeah, I pushed the button.

2692
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:02,870
Oopsie.

2693
02:35:06,610 --> 02:35:08,890
I can't BS my way out of this one.

2694
02:35:10,430 --> 02:35:11,850
Alright, sick ride!

2695
02:35:13,870 --> 02:35:14,550
No!

2696
02:35:30,570 --> 02:35:31,130
SCAR!

2697
02:35:31,490 --> 02:35:32,010
SCAR!

2698
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:39,880
The Betrayed.

2699
02:35:45,430 --> 02:35:46,970
Is this a...

2700
02:35:48,410 --> 02:35:48,970
What?

2701
02:35:49,350 --> 02:35:50,150
How do we live?

2702
02:35:52,690 --> 02:35:54,510
Oh Jack, thank you so much for the 20 gift.

2703
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:55,210
Thank you!

2704
02:35:58,110 --> 02:36:00,630
I've never heard the full version of this song.

2705
02:36:01,290 --> 02:36:04,290
Because this is the same music that they do in...

2706
02:36:05,330 --> 02:36:07,670
In Among Us, but I never knew that there was a...

2707
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:08,750
Yeah, the ejected music.

2708
02:36:08,870 --> 02:36:11,170
I never knew that there was a real full version.

2709
02:36:14,290 --> 02:36:14,730
Wow.

2710
02:36:14,730 --> 02:36:16,190
Long live the king.

2711
02:36:17,550 --> 02:36:19,270
We got 5 out of 5 endings.

2712
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:20,530
I like that last one.

2713
02:36:20,610 --> 02:36:22,070
It was kind of epic to end on.

2714
02:36:23,210 --> 02:36:25,170
There's still so many fails we haven't done.

2715
02:36:26,990 --> 02:36:31,050
Are there any that you would suggest that I should see?

2716
02:36:31,130 --> 02:36:31,990
Anything that's fun.

2717
02:36:39,480 --> 02:36:40,860
The sniper fail.

2718
02:36:42,620 --> 02:36:43,560
All of them.

2719
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:45,000
That was so many!

2720
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:46,820
It's so many!

2721
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:48,780
Sniper and crossbow.

2722
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:49,620
Oh that's right!

2723
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:50,680
This one, right?

2724
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:53,680
Sniper, crossbow.

2725
02:36:57,900 --> 02:36:58,760
Sound war?

2726
02:36:58,860 --> 02:37:01,440
OK, we are going to get MLG pro...OK

2727
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:20,860
Noob slayer!

2728
02:37:21,380 --> 02:37:22,920
Pallory, thank you so much for the 20 units!

2729
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:27,620
Oh yeah, baby!

2730
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:28,460
Oh yeah!

2731
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:30,560
OK, that one was fun.

2732
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:32,460
I saw it.

2733
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:40,960
There's nothing here.

2734
02:37:41,140 --> 02:37:41,820
I want a friend.

2735
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:43,360
Henry Sell.

2736
02:37:44,460 --> 02:37:45,740
There's just one more here.

2737
02:37:45,800 --> 02:37:46,400
What was it?

2738
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:48,340
Sonic Pulse, right?

2739
02:37:51,960 --> 02:37:53,220
I hurt my ear.

2740
02:37:53,400 --> 02:37:55,220
I hurt my ears.

2741
02:37:56,920 --> 02:37:59,560
Let's see if there are ones that are...like these ones.

2742
02:38:00,980 --> 02:38:02,940
I guess some of them are short, right?

2743
02:38:08,140 --> 02:38:09,340
Stop being angry.

2744
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:11,440
Stop being angry.

2745
02:38:14,220 --> 02:38:15,520
They are all short.

2746
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:19,820
Let's just go to the next level.

2747
02:38:20,340 --> 02:38:21,300
The next thing.

2748
02:38:21,780 --> 02:38:22,420
I think we are good.

2749
02:38:22,660 --> 02:38:23,360
I think we are good.

2750
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:24,760
I think we got them all.

2751
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,520
Chapter 5 is very long.

2752
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:27,120
Is it?

2753
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:27,440
OK.

2754
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:29,700
Then we'll go to chapter 5.

2755
02:38:31,060 --> 02:38:32,120
Completing the mission.

2756
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:34,440
What?

2757
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:35,760
What has been the mission?

2758
02:38:37,300 --> 02:38:38,320
What's been the mission?

2759
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:43,400
Wait, I have to pick?

2760
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:50,500
Oh my god.

2761
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:57,840
Evidence stolen teamed up with...Oh my god.

2762
02:38:57,960 --> 02:38:58,380
Wait.

2763
02:38:58,900 --> 02:38:59,940
This is insane!

2764
02:39:02,980 --> 02:39:03,740
OK.

2765
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:09,240
I think we'll just choose...We got to choose a ghost inmate, right?

2766
02:39:11,580 --> 02:39:13,100
And then...

2767
02:39:13,700 --> 02:39:14,940
Maybe the thief.

2768
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:18,820
Ruby stolen from Toppats.

2769
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:20,260
Airship destroyed.

2770
02:39:20,400 --> 02:39:21,160
Government annoyed.

2771
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:22,500
Toppat leaders fled.

2772
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:26,540
There are so many possibilities.

2773
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:29,680
But the presumed dead one is so awesome too.

2774
02:39:30,420 --> 02:39:31,720
But the betrayed one!

2775
02:39:32,220 --> 02:39:33,780
I kind of want to do the betrayed.

2776
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:37,880
I kind of want to do the betrayed one.

2777
02:39:37,980 --> 02:39:38,680
It sounds awesome.

2778
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:47,920
Do it?

2779
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:48,180
OK.

2780
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:55,520
Maybe I will do...like 2 or 3 of these.

2781
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:02,380
I don't...I don't know if I'm going to do all of them you guys.

2782
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:04,420
I can do like 2 or 3.

2783
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:11,240
My hair looks like string cheese.

2784
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:12,700
Huh?

2785
02:40:18,580 --> 02:40:25,240
I thought I was...

2786
02:40:29,900 --> 02:40:33,040
I thought this was...Metal Gear for a second.

2787
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:35,480
Duh.

2788
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:37,580
Duh.

2789
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:40,420
Phantom pan.

2790
02:40:41,160 --> 02:40:41,880
My arm!

2791
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:44,580
Oh my gosh they are grey!

2792
02:40:51,560 --> 02:40:53,240
Good luck.

2793
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:53,520
Oh!

2794
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:54,140
OK.

2795
02:40:56,940 --> 02:40:58,800
I'm afraid it's been 9 years.

2796
02:41:01,240 --> 02:41:03,020
Yeah, kick his ass!

2797
02:41:10,740 --> 02:41:13,120
Spirit form.

2798
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:22,140
That...wait!

2799
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:24,400
Japanese all of a sudden?

2800
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:31,100
No.

2801
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:34,640
Stop the time.

2802
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:42,720
What is this?

2803
02:41:51,640 --> 02:41:54,840
He got a hitter.

2804
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:57,560
Stop me!

2805
02:42:03,080 --> 02:42:09,090
The plot twist.

2806
02:42:15,710 --> 02:42:18,510
The Japanese...

2807
02:42:18,510 --> 02:42:19,510
Stop it.

2808
02:42:19,650 --> 02:42:20,250
Please stop.

2809
02:42:33,650 --> 02:42:35,050
Wait,

2810
02:42:38,970 --> 02:42:39,670
what's happening?

2811
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:40,630
Huh?

2812
02:42:45,890 --> 02:42:47,550
I thought it was part of it.

2813
02:42:48,670 --> 02:42:49,310
Oh!

2814
02:42:49,690 --> 02:42:50,850
My game is not responding.

2815
02:42:53,810 --> 02:42:56,030
Is this part of the bit?

2816
02:42:56,630 --> 02:43:01,750
Is stopping...is freezing the game also part of freezing the...

2817
02:43:04,170 --> 02:43:05,690
He was too strong.

2818
02:43:05,730 --> 02:43:06,790
He froze...wait!

2819
02:43:07,330 --> 02:43:08,830
He froze everything!

2820
02:43:08,830 --> 02:43:12,150
Wait, I'm feeling something in the force.

2821
02:43:14,750 --> 02:43:16,150
You guys!

2822
02:43:16,850 --> 02:43:18,130
Even I've stopped.

2823
02:43:18,830 --> 02:43:19,790
I'm frozen!

2824
02:43:22,430 --> 02:43:24,690
So strong he froze the game.

2825
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:32,520
Game is not Japanese good.

2826
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:39,060
Stream is next.

2827
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:43,920
Just kidding.

2828
02:43:46,870 --> 02:43:47,980
Hold on.

2829
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:49,200
I'm trying to close the game.

2830
02:43:53,740 --> 02:43:55,800
Trying to close the game.

2831
02:43:56,180 --> 02:43:57,080
Close window.

2832
02:43:58,100 --> 02:43:58,940
Close the program.

2833
02:43:59,820 --> 02:44:02,380
Henry Stickmin.exe is not responding.

2834
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:05,540
Oh wait!

2835
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:07,320
No!

2836
02:44:07,700 --> 02:44:11,960
Actually this...kind of actually...is very annoying for me.

2837
02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:12,460
No!

2838
02:44:13,060 --> 02:44:14,400
This is actually kind of annoying for me.

2839
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:16,040
Because of the way...the game is old.

2840
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:18,540
When I had to like...

2841
02:44:33,210 --> 02:44:34,190
Give me a second.

2842
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:35,010
I'm going to do something.

2843
02:44:36,150 --> 02:44:36,770
Wait, hold on.

2844
02:44:36,910 --> 02:44:38,850
Actually if I do this it might cause it.

2845
02:44:40,350 --> 02:44:40,710
Oh!

2846
02:44:40,970 --> 02:44:41,590
I fixed it.

2847
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:41,810
OK.

2848
02:44:42,390 --> 02:44:42,670
OK!

2849
02:44:42,730 --> 02:44:43,030
We're good.

2850
02:44:43,090 --> 02:44:43,370
We're good.

2851
02:44:46,350 --> 02:44:47,550
We're OK.

2852
02:44:48,410 --> 02:44:49,370
Everything is fine.

2853
02:44:50,870 --> 02:44:56,650
OK, so maybe I shouldn't do that.

2854
02:45:01,590 --> 02:45:03,030
Maybe I...

2855
02:45:03,510 --> 02:45:07,530
We'll do the Charlie, right?

2856
02:45:10,830 --> 02:45:12,890
Assisted by Charles.

2857
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:15,390
We'll do the Charlie...

2858
02:45:15,390 --> 02:45:17,390
Charlie instead.

2859
02:45:17,810 --> 02:45:19,270
JoJo was too strong.

2860
02:45:23,190 --> 02:45:26,890
I like Charlie, so...

2861
02:45:31,710 --> 02:45:32,910
OK.

2862
02:46:02,070 --> 02:46:03,470
Charlie.

2863
02:46:05,570 --> 02:46:06,930
Smoking man.

2864
02:46:08,490 --> 02:46:09,190
OK!

2865
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:13,370
He's like such a silent protagonist.

2866
02:46:18,230 --> 02:46:18,670
Potatoes.

2867
02:46:27,250 --> 02:46:27,690
No!

2868
02:46:28,350 --> 02:46:28,510
Oh!

2869
02:46:29,150 --> 02:46:29,550
Wait!

2870
02:46:29,650 --> 02:46:29,930
No!

2871
02:46:30,850 --> 02:46:31,550
We'll take it down.

2872
02:46:32,230 --> 02:46:33,070
Yeah, we'll deal with it.

2873
02:46:33,290 --> 02:46:34,770
I'm going to stomp on it.

2874
02:46:36,050 --> 02:46:36,850
Yeah!

2875
02:46:37,310 --> 02:46:38,110
Oh!

2876
02:46:38,470 --> 02:46:39,030
That's me.

2877
02:46:41,630 --> 02:46:43,270
Saved you Charles!

2878
02:46:44,110 --> 02:46:47,490
A hundred and...there is a hundred and sixty-four unique.

2879
02:46:47,830 --> 02:46:48,930
Holy moly!

2880
02:46:49,510 --> 02:46:50,890
What about a cupcake?

2881
02:46:57,890 --> 02:46:58,690
Worth.

2882
02:47:00,490 --> 02:47:01,850
We'll do a drawing.

2883
02:47:02,270 --> 02:47:03,010
This one is Shirley.

2884
02:47:03,230 --> 02:47:05,110
We'll draw another helicopter.

2885
02:47:05,930 --> 02:47:07,850
Or a cloud.

2886
02:47:08,050 --> 02:47:09,290
Only clouds.

2887
02:47:12,750 --> 02:47:13,970
Nice!

2888
02:47:17,110 --> 02:47:18,510
Immediately.

2889
02:47:21,530 --> 02:47:21,770
OK!

2890
02:47:23,710 --> 02:47:23,970
OK!

2891
02:47:28,110 --> 02:47:29,670
Invisible bridge?

2892
02:47:35,810 --> 02:47:38,570
Go ahead and just make your way across then.

2893
02:47:42,050 --> 02:47:43,890
He didn't put it there.

2894
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:44,450
Silly!

2895
02:47:48,610 --> 02:47:49,050
Trapeze!

2896
02:47:52,250 --> 02:47:56,850
I'm going to have to get more tea in a bit if you guys don't mind.

2897
02:47:59,530 --> 02:47:59,970
Trapeze!

2898
02:48:05,690 --> 02:48:06,410
I

2899
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:19,320
missed one!

2900
02:48:20,380 --> 02:48:21,100
Where?

2901
02:48:21,360 --> 02:48:21,920
Oh here.

2902
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:23,120
I got him.

2903
02:48:25,900 --> 02:48:28,840
I'm going to do a TV broadcast.

2904
02:48:29,740 --> 02:48:30,460
Oh!

2905
02:48:30,580 --> 02:48:31,500
OK like that.

2906
02:48:32,660 --> 02:48:33,240
No way!

2907
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:34,060
It's Seinfeld!

2908
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:46,840
It's a good show Brett!

2909
02:48:57,340 --> 02:48:59,220
What about a remote top hat?

2910
02:49:02,990 --> 02:49:03,370
Oh wait!

2911
02:49:03,530 --> 02:49:04,870
This is Hunter x Hunter, no?

2912
02:49:08,670 --> 02:49:09,210
Oh yeah!

2913
02:49:10,010 --> 02:49:12,810
I got him.

2914
02:49:13,830 --> 02:49:15,590
He's doing his own distraction dance.

2915
02:49:15,630 --> 02:49:16,110
He's so good.

2916
02:49:20,570 --> 02:49:21,130
Nice!

2917
02:49:31,530 --> 02:49:32,410
Buddy!

2918
02:49:41,060 --> 02:49:43,260
I'm going to just turn it off.

2919
02:49:47,270 --> 02:49:50,030
Turn it off

2920
02:49:56,100 --> 02:49:56,680
boys!

2921
02:49:57,280 --> 02:49:59,160
That's what that stood for.

2922
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:02,820
Charles!

2923
02:50:03,280 --> 02:50:04,180
I'm sorry.

2924
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:04,960
I'm sorry Charlie.

2925
02:50:05,540 --> 02:50:06,600
Just for fun.

2926
02:50:07,220 --> 02:50:07,780
Let's do the wrench.

2927
02:50:16,340 --> 02:50:18,020
I fixed it!

2928
02:50:18,060 --> 02:50:18,880
Fix it Freddy!

2929
02:50:23,660 --> 02:50:25,900
It was only a level 2 engine.

2930
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:27,240
CF2 joke.

2931
02:50:28,220 --> 02:50:29,540
There is too many!

2932
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:36,360
So many...so many...so many...of those...

2933
02:50:36,360 --> 02:50:42,280
I never got so much into all the Valve...I say Valve games, but you know what I mean.

2934
02:50:44,140 --> 02:50:49,840
I always...I would call them Steam games, because back then they were like the games of Steam, you know what I mean.

2935
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:54,080
So I would always be like, they are the Steam games.

2936
02:51:02,150 --> 02:51:04,630
No, they are Valve games.

2937
02:51:05,090 --> 02:51:05,990
Oh, then I was right.

2938
02:51:08,390 --> 02:51:09,550
The Steam games.

2939
02:51:11,910 --> 02:51:12,830
Red Herring.

2940
02:51:20,390 --> 02:51:21,550
Steam Developer.

2941
02:51:22,930 --> 02:51:25,550
I did get into Portal though.

2942
02:51:39,250 --> 02:51:41,050
Thank you for the Donation!

2943
02:51:41,710 --> 02:51:42,330
Thank you!

2944
02:51:44,210 --> 02:51:45,950
There are so many guys here.

2945
02:51:47,350 --> 02:51:48,710
We're gonna...bug juice.

2946
02:51:49,710 --> 02:51:51,850
This will turn the user into a bug.

2947
02:51:52,090 --> 02:51:53,230
Oh my gosh!

2948
02:51:53,330 --> 02:51:54,210
The guys up!

2949
02:51:56,030 --> 02:51:57,990
Remember when Steam only had Valve games?

2950
02:51:58,250 --> 02:51:58,730
Right!

2951
02:51:59,690 --> 02:52:00,730
They were the Valve, yeah.

2952
02:52:01,010 --> 02:52:01,630
You're so right.

2953
02:52:03,870 --> 02:52:07,590
I forgot that that was...I forgot that that was the case actually.

2954
02:52:08,450 --> 02:52:10,510
I guess it only lasts for an hour and bug years.

2955
02:52:11,510 --> 02:52:14,510
I don't want to become a Tarakon.

2956
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:16,010
Painting Portal.

2957
02:52:21,010 --> 02:52:21,250
No!

2958
02:52:22,530 --> 02:52:22,750
No!

2959
02:52:26,090 --> 02:52:33,730
I don't want to play Mario 64!

2960
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:35,350
Please!

2961
02:52:38,190 --> 02:52:41,210
Gotta collect more of those extra life mushrooms.

2962
02:52:41,670 --> 02:52:43,250
Alright, so we're swapping.

2963
02:52:43,390 --> 02:52:44,190
We're doing the swapper.

2964
02:52:44,330 --> 02:52:44,470
Oh!

2965
02:52:45,290 --> 02:52:47,710
Just point the rod at the person you like to swap places with.

2966
02:52:47,790 --> 02:52:48,450
It's that easy!

2967
02:52:48,630 --> 02:52:49,330
I use this everyday!

2968
02:52:49,530 --> 02:52:49,970
It's great!

2969
02:52:50,350 --> 02:52:51,110
Thanks Gadget Gabe.

2970
02:52:51,430 --> 02:52:53,430
I trust you with my afterlife.

2971
02:52:53,930 --> 02:52:54,490
And my life.

2972
02:53:02,530 --> 02:53:07,250
I did get this guy.

2973
02:53:07,390 --> 02:53:07,910
I remember his hair.

2974
02:53:09,870 --> 02:53:10,270
Yeah!

2975
02:53:11,930 --> 02:53:14,610
I was going to say I was your leader.

2976
02:53:23,470 --> 02:53:23,870
Flanks?

2977
02:53:32,530 --> 02:53:33,590
IR Sniper...Sleep Dart!

2978
02:53:33,810 --> 02:53:34,210
There you go.

2979
02:53:34,430 --> 02:53:35,810
I should totally play Mario 64.

2980
02:53:36,070 --> 02:53:36,530
No thank you!

2981
02:53:38,770 --> 02:53:41,630
I went through my hell.

2982
02:53:42,450 --> 02:53:43,790
Oh no!

2983
02:53:44,030 --> 02:53:44,910
The glass!

2984
02:53:49,710 --> 02:53:52,310
This one...Oh nice!

2985
02:53:54,910 --> 02:53:58,410
Henry is...Henry is...

2986
02:53:58,410 --> 02:54:01,710
I was going to say he is like an anti-hero.

2987
02:54:02,410 --> 02:54:02,730
I

2988
02:54:10,240 --> 02:54:13,340
got that going for me I guess.

2989
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:15,620
Charles?

2990
02:54:17,220 --> 02:54:17,860
Charles?

2991
02:54:20,060 --> 02:54:20,700
Charles?

2992
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:22,380
What's Charlie's last name?

2993
02:54:23,720 --> 02:54:24,080
Wow!

2994
02:54:24,140 --> 02:54:25,120
There are so many guys.

2995
02:54:25,780 --> 02:54:28,380
12 pages worth of men!

2996
02:54:29,940 --> 02:54:31,020
Oh my God!

2997
02:54:32,460 --> 02:54:33,100
Wow!

2998
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:35,820
But this one.

2999
02:54:35,900 --> 02:54:36,420
This is Hunter.

3000
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:36,900
Hunter right?

3001
02:54:36,900 --> 02:54:38,020
Gone Hunter.

3002
02:54:39,660 --> 02:54:43,420
Anyway, we'll do the horn.

3003
02:54:47,240 --> 02:54:47,800
OK

3004
02:54:59,690 --> 02:55:00,850
Nice!

3005
02:55:05,230 --> 02:55:07,170
That was it?

3006
02:55:10,410 --> 02:55:11,070
That was it?

3007
02:55:11,810 --> 02:55:14,010
I feel like there was no other routes here right?

3008
02:55:20,550 --> 02:55:21,030
Yeah!

3009
02:55:29,970 --> 02:55:31,490
Is this the good ending?

3010
02:55:31,490 --> 02:55:31,770
Good ending!

3011
02:55:37,390 --> 02:55:40,930
Each route has one ending.

3012
02:55:42,030 --> 02:55:42,790
Ah I see!

3013
02:55:43,390 --> 02:55:44,650
They don't branch out like normal.

3014
02:55:45,790 --> 02:55:47,730
Special Brovert Ops!

3015
02:55:51,810 --> 02:55:53,350
Oh yeah baby!

3016
02:55:53,590 --> 02:55:54,750
Oh the bro ending!

3017
02:55:55,770 --> 02:55:56,750
Oh yeah baby!

3018
02:55:56,870 --> 02:55:57,390
Oh yeah!

3019
02:55:59,270 --> 02:56:00,410
Oh yeah you're right.

3020
02:56:01,610 --> 02:56:03,370
I didn't get all of these.

3021
02:56:03,630 --> 02:56:04,270
That's OK though.

3022
02:56:04,410 --> 02:56:04,630
You know what?

3023
02:56:04,650 --> 02:56:04,930
That's OK.

3024
02:56:05,010 --> 02:56:05,210
Wait.

3025
02:56:05,710 --> 02:56:06,630
0 out of 2?

3026
02:56:07,510 --> 02:56:11,230
That's the one that we crashed on.

3027
02:56:11,810 --> 02:56:12,310
Alright.

3028
02:56:12,830 --> 02:56:14,390
Well then...

3029
02:56:15,610 --> 02:56:16,670
I...Oh my gosh!

3030
02:56:16,850 --> 02:56:20,770
I don't remember at all what ending I got before.

3031
02:56:22,310 --> 02:56:24,090
What would be...

3032
02:56:30,130 --> 02:56:31,070
I don't know.

3033
02:56:31,390 --> 02:56:32,530
I don't want to try the other one.

3034
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:34,050
I'm scared of trying the other one again.

3035
02:56:34,970 --> 02:56:35,930
Wandering Taco!

3036
02:56:36,450 --> 02:56:37,610
Thank you so much for the 50!

3037
02:56:38,530 --> 02:56:39,130
Thank you!

3038
02:56:39,370 --> 02:56:39,690
Thank you!

3039
02:56:41,510 --> 02:56:43,450
R-B-H-I-R-O.

3040
02:56:43,710 --> 02:56:45,390
R-B-H...

3041
02:56:47,580 --> 02:56:51,080
R-B-H-I-R-O.

3042
02:56:51,140 --> 02:56:51,520
This one?

3043
02:56:53,280 --> 02:56:54,360
Right hand man defeated.

3044
02:56:54,480 --> 02:56:55,080
Tank stolen.

3045
02:56:55,080 --> 02:56:56,020
Pardon.

3046
02:56:56,140 --> 02:56:57,460
Oh this is the pardon one.

3047
02:56:57,700 --> 02:56:57,840
OK.

3048
02:56:58,340 --> 02:56:59,180
This is the...OK.

3049
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:02,080
We'll try it.

3050
02:57:06,960 --> 02:57:09,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah and then he saved us.

3051
02:57:09,740 --> 02:57:09,860
OK.

3052
02:57:31,320 --> 02:57:31,920
Frog!

3053
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:32,520
Please...Pilk!

3054
02:57:32,600 --> 02:57:33,160
She's scared.

3055
02:57:35,260 --> 02:57:38,040
Wait, wait, wait...

3056
02:57:38,040 --> 02:57:39,480
Wait a second!

3057
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:46,040
Ah!

3058
02:57:48,060 --> 02:57:49,940
Are we gonna be...Ah!

3059
02:57:54,840 --> 02:57:56,520
Are we gonna do the jump?

3060
02:57:56,900 --> 02:57:57,860
The Halo jump?

3061
02:57:59,040 --> 02:58:00,220
No way!

3062
02:58:01,580 --> 02:58:07,520
I like how it's a mix between 3 and 5.

3063
02:58:09,420 --> 02:58:11,640
It's like 5 credits.

3064
02:58:23,640 --> 02:58:25,300
Failed specialist.

3065
02:58:25,700 --> 02:58:26,560
See it Warbur?

3066
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:29,000
Motivator missing!

3067
02:58:40,460 --> 02:58:43,260
Directed by...

3068
02:58:54,560 --> 02:58:55,960
Ah!

3069
02:58:57,120 --> 02:58:57,960
Pilksen!

3070
02:58:59,300 --> 02:59:01,820
I can't...I can't say that name.

3071
02:59:05,400 --> 02:59:06,540
Frog!

3072
02:59:07,460 --> 02:59:13,540
Oh my God.

3073
02:59:16,040 --> 02:59:16,900
Eel.

3074
02:59:17,240 --> 02:59:17,820
Yummy.

3075
02:59:18,800 --> 02:59:20,060
Amelia Esteban.

3076
02:59:22,600 --> 02:59:23,040
No!

3077
02:59:23,880 --> 02:59:26,280
We have the whole team!

3078
02:59:28,800 --> 02:59:30,520
Mr. Dr. Donny, welcome to the membership.

3079
02:59:30,680 --> 02:59:31,100
Thank you!

3080
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:32,140
Frog!

3081
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:37,260
Yeah!

3082
02:59:45,540 --> 02:59:48,280
Wait, wait, wait...

3083
02:59:51,140 --> 02:59:58,120
And they're using MGS1 codec style.

3084
02:59:59,940 --> 03:00:01,840
They're crossing the streams.

3085
03:00:03,780 --> 03:00:04,500
Metal Gear.

3086
03:00:09,420 --> 03:00:12,740
The Right Hand Man.

3087
03:00:13,280 --> 03:00:16,660
It's actually such a good name.

3088
03:00:17,760 --> 03:00:19,820
It's actually such a good Metal Gear name.

3089
03:00:25,520 --> 03:00:28,540
Why do we get to work with...Frog?

3090
03:00:33,360 --> 03:00:33,880
OK

3091
03:00:37,660 --> 03:00:38,700
Oh CQC!

3092
03:00:39,320 --> 03:00:40,860
This won't work though, will it?

3093
03:00:42,900 --> 03:00:44,300
Ah!

3094
03:00:53,740 --> 03:00:55,080
Convert?

3095
03:00:55,740 --> 03:00:56,940
Wait...Wololo!

3096
03:01:08,830 --> 03:01:12,610
Looks like they left in a hurry.

3097
03:01:22,830 --> 03:01:25,950
I can't believe it was a really Wololo!

3098
03:01:29,710 --> 03:01:31,030
Oh my gosh!

3099
03:01:34,090 --> 03:01:36,530
I can't believe it was a really Wololo!

3100
03:01:46,390 --> 03:01:47,910
OK you guys, give me one second.

3101
03:01:48,030 --> 03:01:49,950
I'm gonna go grab a drink real quick.

3102
03:01:50,850 --> 03:01:55,910
I'm gonna go grab some more tea real quick and maybe some dinner too.

3103
03:01:55,970 --> 03:01:56,690
I'm starting to get hungry.

3104
03:01:56,690 --> 03:02:00,110
I only had like half of my dinner earlier so...

3105
03:02:07,650 --> 03:02:09,210
OK, I'll be right back.

3106
03:02:09,310 --> 03:02:09,890
I'll be right back.

3107
03:02:09,990 --> 03:02:11,110
I'll be right back.

3108
03:03:56,580 --> 03:03:57,520
I'm back.

3109
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:58,540
Sorry about that.

3110
03:03:58,720 --> 03:03:59,100
I'm back.

3111
03:03:59,240 --> 03:03:59,500
I'm back.

3112
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:04,880
I was out of hot water and didn't realize.

3113
03:04:05,620 --> 03:04:09,780
No tea for me, but I got...I got some Gamer Chaps.

3114
03:04:11,020 --> 03:04:14,660
Use code Boomer for 10% off your order.

3115
03:04:15,980 --> 03:04:17,480
I got some Gamer Chaps.

3116
03:04:17,580 --> 03:04:19,720
I got my raspberry drink.

3117
03:04:20,880 --> 03:04:24,860
And I got some chicken, like fast food chicken earlier.

3118
03:04:25,720 --> 03:04:26,920
That's my dinner.

3119
03:04:28,600 --> 03:04:29,640
Yeah, code Boomer.

3120
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:33,640
Alrighty, let's continue onwards.

3121
03:04:34,780 --> 03:04:35,980
Suppressing fire.

3122
03:04:36,340 --> 03:04:37,980
No, we're gonna dogpile him.

3123
03:04:38,800 --> 03:04:39,460
Oh!

3124
03:04:40,300 --> 03:04:42,980
Oh yeah dogpile!

3125
03:04:45,960 --> 03:04:46,500
Oh dang

3126
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:54,560
Chicken and Gamer Chaps with a Gamer

3127
03:04:59,900 --> 03:05:01,220
Dance off!

3128
03:05:02,100 --> 03:05:02,580
Oh!

3129
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:08,960
He didn't even let me try.

3130
03:05:09,500 --> 03:05:11,560
Suppressing fire.

3131
03:05:14,060 --> 03:05:16,220
Stop talking like that.

3132
03:05:25,430 --> 03:05:25,910
No!

3133
03:05:26,150 --> 03:05:27,390
Why are you so obsessed with me?

3134
03:05:32,590 --> 03:05:33,990
Go on, on your feet.

3135
03:05:34,990 --> 03:05:36,570
I'll give you one shot.

3136
03:05:38,410 --> 03:05:39,590
One shot eh?

3137
03:05:41,270 --> 03:05:42,210
We got this.

3138
03:05:42,290 --> 03:05:43,030
Rip frog!

3139
03:05:43,410 --> 03:05:43,650
No!

3140
03:05:53,580 --> 03:05:55,520
Henry bit the dust.

3141
03:05:55,940 --> 03:05:56,720
Dance off again.

3142
03:05:57,420 --> 03:05:59,340
Hold on, I want to do Rock, Paper, Scissors first.

3143
03:06:06,960 --> 03:06:08,040
These are cheating.

3144
03:06:10,140 --> 03:06:11,520
These are cheating times.

3145
03:06:14,080 --> 03:06:15,300
Laser always wins.

3146
03:06:21,710 --> 03:06:22,470
No!

3147
03:06:23,670 --> 03:06:26,370
Guys, they are saying no more dance off.

3148
03:06:26,810 --> 03:06:27,630
No more fun.

3149
03:06:28,630 --> 03:06:29,350
No more fun.

3150
03:06:30,250 --> 03:06:31,590
Cheap fighting combo.

3151
03:06:46,780 --> 03:06:48,180
Get stun locked?

3152
03:06:52,800 --> 03:06:54,220
That pissed me off.

3153
03:06:59,020 --> 03:07:03,600
I wasn't even a part of...I was the one doing that as the hero and that pissed me off.

3154
03:07:13,690 --> 03:07:14,610
Stop it!

3155
03:07:17,110 --> 03:07:17,570
Ocarina?

3156
03:07:18,310 --> 03:07:19,610
Wait, what if we rewire him?

3157
03:07:19,690 --> 03:07:20,630
He will be our pet.

3158
03:07:22,290 --> 03:07:23,990
We will rewire him to like us.

3159
03:07:27,570 --> 03:07:28,010
Yeah!

3160
03:07:36,430 --> 03:07:42,550
What are you doing?

3161
03:07:43,050 --> 03:07:43,870
You are our boss.

3162
03:07:44,470 --> 03:07:46,890
You are really going to side with the guy who locked up the chief?

3163
03:07:48,290 --> 03:07:49,170
Oh no!

3164
03:07:49,170 --> 03:07:49,970
Oh no!

3165
03:07:57,920 --> 03:07:59,980
Sorry, I'm trying to eat.

3166
03:08:00,140 --> 03:08:04,400
That was such a long cutscene.

3167
03:08:05,600 --> 03:08:06,140
Ocarina?

3168
03:08:16,350 --> 03:08:16,830
Hello?

3169
03:08:17,710 --> 03:08:18,230
No!

3170
03:08:18,750 --> 03:08:20,390
You guys, I think my game crashed again.

3171
03:08:21,070 --> 03:08:21,550
No!

3172
03:08:23,190 --> 03:08:25,150
No, it crashed!

3173
03:08:25,770 --> 03:08:26,330
Why

3174
03:08:32,780 --> 03:08:35,440
again?

3175
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:41,040
Stopped time.

3176
03:08:43,040 --> 03:08:44,580
It stopped time.

3177
03:09:08,110 --> 03:09:10,570
Hi-Rez full screen seems to do that.

3178
03:09:10,650 --> 03:09:11,890
I'm not in full screen.

3179
03:09:14,330 --> 03:09:16,530
I'm in windowed.

3180
03:09:20,610 --> 03:09:22,790
We got one ending at least.

3181
03:09:23,430 --> 03:09:25,930
But I'm kind of like... I'm salty.

3182
03:09:38,750 --> 03:09:40,610
Should be able to go back to where you were.

3183
03:09:40,830 --> 03:09:41,770
Well, you think?

3184
03:09:42,350 --> 03:09:44,030
Maybe I just won't do the Ocarina then.

3185
03:09:44,670 --> 03:09:46,530
It was this one and this one, right?

3186
03:09:50,190 --> 03:09:51,170
Open the map!

3187
03:09:51,350 --> 03:09:51,590
Oops.

3188
03:09:52,290 --> 03:09:53,230
Oh no!

3189
03:09:53,450 --> 03:09:56,130
I'm going to have to watch the Metal Gear reference again?

3190
03:09:56,770 --> 03:09:57,570
Oh no!

3191
03:09:59,010 --> 03:10:00,290
Oh silly me!

3192
03:10:02,050 --> 03:10:02,870
Oh what?

3193
03:10:05,610 --> 03:10:06,710
OK, I'll skip it.

3194
03:10:06,710 --> 03:10:07,210
I'm just kidding.

3195
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:10,310
But what if I danced off here?

3196
03:10:13,250 --> 03:10:14,450
Do not!

3197
03:10:15,350 --> 03:10:16,610
And what if we stealth here?

3198
03:10:19,870 --> 03:10:20,490
What the?

3199
03:10:21,430 --> 03:10:22,630
That's so messed up.

3200
03:10:22,750 --> 03:10:24,590
This would never have happened at 100.

3201
03:10:24,730 --> 03:10:25,870
Wait, what is that a reference to?

3202
03:10:26,710 --> 03:10:28,630
Is that Skyrim again?

3203
03:10:29,450 --> 03:10:30,330
Wait, what's that interface?

3204
03:10:31,530 --> 03:10:32,190
Is it Skyrim?

3205
03:10:34,950 --> 03:10:35,470
I don't know.

3206
03:10:35,850 --> 03:10:37,050
Oh my gosh, I'm such a gamer.

3207
03:10:41,470 --> 03:10:43,310
Wow, I guess we got a world level game.

3208
03:10:44,390 --> 03:10:44,850
Wait, wait, wait.

3209
03:10:48,210 --> 03:10:49,010
Narwini

3210
03:10:54,850 --> 03:10:55,650
Erectus?

3211
03:10:57,770 --> 03:11:00,010
He's still speaking in AoE?

3212
03:11:03,270 --> 03:11:06,330
OK, I'll use the map here now.

3213
03:11:06,570 --> 03:11:06,830
Don't worry.

3214
03:11:21,170 --> 03:11:22,090
OK, map.

3215
03:11:22,990 --> 03:11:25,090
It was here.

3216
03:11:25,890 --> 03:11:27,670
OK, we're just going to finish him.

3217
03:11:32,630 --> 03:11:33,450
See ya!

3218
03:11:42,410 --> 03:11:44,710
Oh, I have to do the Ocarina.

3219
03:11:44,850 --> 03:11:45,290
Oh gosh.

3220
03:11:46,450 --> 03:11:47,950
OK, hopefully it doesn't crash.

3221
03:11:49,630 --> 03:11:51,610
It worked!

3222
03:11:51,750 --> 03:11:51,890
Yay!

3223
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:56,670
No, it didn't.

3224
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:04,140
Something's happening.

3225
03:12:13,940 --> 03:12:14,520
Charles!

3226
03:12:16,540 --> 03:12:17,700
Unlucky.

3227
03:12:19,060 --> 03:12:20,880
I guess we can't get this ending.

3228
03:12:20,880 --> 03:12:22,520
That's so disappointing.

3229
03:12:24,580 --> 03:12:25,780
Alt-Tab and return.

3230
03:12:26,180 --> 03:12:28,880
I think it won't work though, because like...

3231
03:12:32,780 --> 03:12:33,920
No, it didn't work.

3232
03:12:34,140 --> 03:12:37,020
I was going to say, it's already done the cutscene though.

3233
03:12:38,980 --> 03:12:39,440
Why?

3234
03:12:39,720 --> 03:12:42,020
I never had these issues with the game before.

3235
03:12:42,460 --> 03:12:43,520
Never seen Crash so much.

3236
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:44,020
Me neither!

3237
03:12:44,020 --> 03:12:44,320
Never!

3238
03:12:50,740 --> 03:12:52,900
I am playing it windowed.

3239
03:12:53,640 --> 03:12:54,720
Shut up.

3240
03:12:55,540 --> 03:12:56,860
I literally said that.

3241
03:12:56,940 --> 03:12:57,700
Use your ears.

3242
03:12:58,200 --> 03:13:01,620
Someone said it happens if you play in fullscreen and I said I'm not playing in fullscreen.

3243
03:13:01,860 --> 03:13:03,020
I'm playing windowed.

3244
03:13:10,540 --> 03:13:12,360
Let me try again.

3245
03:13:30,420 --> 03:13:31,720
I mean, have you tried playing windowed?

3246
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:32,840
I just got here.

3247
03:13:37,960 --> 03:13:38,400
OK.

3248
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:43,400
How is this so stinky, right?

3249
03:13:43,920 --> 03:13:45,020
Lower your graphics.

3250
03:13:46,240 --> 03:13:47,380
This is so stinky.

3251
03:13:48,800 --> 03:13:50,280
Maybe we do like a different one.

3252
03:13:50,360 --> 03:13:51,220
This one is kind of fun, right?

3253
03:13:51,260 --> 03:13:52,000
The fake to death.

3254
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:54,000
One is kind of cool.

3255
03:13:58,380 --> 03:14:00,380
I like the betrayed one too.

3256
03:14:03,100 --> 03:14:05,660
I think I clicked menu instead of map.

3257
03:14:05,740 --> 03:14:06,060
There we go.

3258
03:14:06,180 --> 03:14:06,460
My bad.

3259
03:14:07,080 --> 03:14:09,100
The betrayed one I wanted to do also.

3260
03:14:10,840 --> 03:14:12,760
This is the betrayed, right?

3261
03:14:13,720 --> 03:14:14,100
Yeah.

3262
03:14:16,240 --> 03:14:18,760
I barely even got anywhere into this one.

3263
03:14:20,780 --> 03:14:21,300
What?

3264
03:14:26,620 --> 03:14:29,600
Playing in windowed was originally supposed to be Resident Evil 4.

3265
03:14:29,820 --> 03:14:30,740
No way!

3266
03:14:34,600 --> 03:14:35,120
OK.

3267
03:14:35,500 --> 03:14:36,180
Spirit form?

3268
03:14:39,890 --> 03:14:41,850
Which is the correct answer you guys?

3269
03:14:43,630 --> 03:14:45,170
Which is the correct one?

3270
03:14:45,250 --> 03:14:47,730
Because spirit is what crashed the game earlier.

3271
03:14:49,010 --> 03:14:50,630
Spirit form won't take you to an ending.

3272
03:14:50,750 --> 03:14:50,930
OK.

3273
03:14:52,550 --> 03:14:54,770
Blade is the...

3274
03:14:54,770 --> 03:14:55,430
Blade?

3275
03:14:57,230 --> 03:14:58,790
Let's try blade form.

3276
03:14:59,390 --> 03:15:03,550
If I'm getting five guys, I'm gonna be...

3277
03:15:20,220 --> 03:15:22,580
Oh my God, it's so epic.

3278
03:15:26,520 --> 03:15:28,400
Oh my God!

3279
03:15:32,180 --> 03:15:33,120
No, our sword.

3280
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:35,460
But we got him in the eye.

3281
03:15:48,890 --> 03:15:49,930
I'm gonna eat that.

3282
03:15:51,490 --> 03:15:52,830
I'm gonna eat that right up.

3283
03:15:53,110 --> 03:15:53,590
Oh my God.

3284
03:15:57,310 --> 03:15:57,750
Lure?

3285
03:16:01,460 --> 03:16:02,260
Oh.

3286
03:16:04,920 --> 03:16:07,120
That's gotta be the play of the game.

3287
03:16:07,180 --> 03:16:07,460
Wait.

3288
03:16:09,180 --> 03:16:09,720
No!

3289
03:16:11,340 --> 03:16:12,460
Is this Overwatch?

3290
03:16:17,780 --> 03:16:19,460
We're just standing there.

3291
03:16:29,350 --> 03:16:30,490
Dead game.

3292
03:16:30,950 --> 03:16:31,670
Just kidding.

3293
03:16:32,450 --> 03:16:33,390
Baseball bat.

3294
03:16:36,270 --> 03:16:38,490
This is Marvel Rivals moment.

3295
03:16:39,210 --> 03:16:40,310
Home run!

3296
03:16:47,660 --> 03:16:49,200
We're too good!

3297
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:53,040
OK, Y type move.

3298
03:16:55,440 --> 03:16:56,940
Big blast!

3299
03:16:56,940 --> 03:16:57,040
Blast.

3300
03:17:06,730 --> 03:17:07,970
Oh, it's a Z move.

3301
03:17:08,070 --> 03:17:09,850
I get it, like a Z move.

3302
03:17:10,350 --> 03:17:11,270
That's so stupid.

3303
03:17:12,770 --> 03:17:16,370
Instead of a Z type... Z move, it's a Y... OK, I get it.

3304
03:17:16,410 --> 03:17:17,310
I was like, what is...

3305
03:17:20,650 --> 03:17:23,850
Oh my God!

3306
03:17:23,850 --> 03:17:26,090
What are you going to do?

3307
03:17:29,010 --> 03:17:29,950
Staple?

3308
03:17:31,610 --> 03:17:32,930
Drop airship.

3309
03:17:33,230 --> 03:17:33,590
Airship!

3310
03:17:41,990 --> 03:17:48,570
Oh my God, the top bats.

3311
03:17:50,530 --> 03:17:51,450
Oh, stop.

3312
03:17:55,610 --> 03:17:57,630
It's so horrible.

3313
03:18:00,350 --> 03:18:01,650
Oh God.

3314
03:18:02,090 --> 03:18:03,910
Let's drop him instead.

3315
03:18:07,250 --> 03:18:08,470
Yeah!

3316
03:18:10,590 --> 03:18:13,030
Feel my pain!

3317
03:18:13,030 --> 03:18:14,830
Anyone available?

3318
03:18:15,090 --> 03:18:16,570
There is an attacker in the cockpit.

3319
03:18:21,010 --> 03:18:21,470
Oh, OK.

3320
03:18:22,490 --> 03:18:23,010
They...

3321
03:18:23,010 --> 03:18:25,550
They predicted that.

3322
03:18:25,850 --> 03:18:27,090
They would know, right?

3323
03:18:29,690 --> 03:18:31,830
They perfected that move, so...

3324
03:18:32,410 --> 03:18:33,550
They would know, right?

3325
03:18:33,670 --> 03:18:34,450
OK, let's staple him.

3326
03:18:39,270 --> 03:18:40,530
A new skin healer.

3327
03:18:41,010 --> 03:18:44,130
Like a good captain would.

3328
03:18:59,430 --> 03:19:03,450
Oh, he's still alive.

3329
03:19:17,030 --> 03:19:18,370
Mission complete.

3330
03:19:37,260 --> 03:19:37,940
Revenge!

3331
03:19:48,390 --> 03:19:52,090
Alright, we'll try and go back to this one.

3332
03:19:55,330 --> 03:19:57,770
Let's see if the Ocarina works this time.

3333
03:20:01,050 --> 03:20:02,750
Let's hope, let's hope, let's hope!

3334
03:20:13,800 --> 03:20:15,540
You break my game!

3335
03:20:18,280 --> 03:20:19,940
I don't know what's going on here.

3336
03:20:26,240 --> 03:20:29,840
I'm listening to the...I'm listening to the cutscene.

3337
03:20:37,220 --> 03:20:39,640
We are listening.

3338
03:20:41,800 --> 03:20:43,120
Is this the actual ending?

3339
03:20:43,340 --> 03:20:43,960
I'm imagining.

3340
03:20:44,120 --> 03:20:44,840
Yeah, it's radio.

3341
03:20:45,400 --> 03:20:46,580
You guys use your imagination!

3342
03:20:47,820 --> 03:20:48,680
This is just like radio.

3343
03:21:04,980 --> 03:21:06,120
Was that the ending?

3344
03:21:15,280 --> 03:21:15,840
Audiobook.

3345
03:21:16,120 --> 03:21:17,440
I think we did it.

3346
03:21:26,680 --> 03:21:28,040
I think we did it.

3347
03:21:30,300 --> 03:21:31,740
Close the program.

3348
03:21:34,780 --> 03:21:35,680
Open the game.

3349
03:21:36,800 --> 03:21:39,420
Well wait, I got three endings, right?

3350
03:21:39,760 --> 03:21:41,040
Well, kind of.

3351
03:21:41,440 --> 03:21:41,960
Technically.

3352
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:45,000
Technically, right?

3353
03:21:45,680 --> 03:21:47,160
Liquidated Dingleton III.

3354
03:21:47,680 --> 03:21:48,300
Welcome to my mission.

3355
03:21:48,440 --> 03:21:48,840
Thank you!

3356
03:21:48,840 --> 03:21:55,310
If you're running Discord in the background, it apparently crashes.

3357
03:21:55,510 --> 03:21:55,850
What?

3358
03:21:56,150 --> 03:21:56,770
No way!

3359
03:21:57,370 --> 03:21:58,650
Wait, I do have Discord open.

3360
03:22:00,390 --> 03:22:01,430
I'll exit out.

3361
03:22:01,610 --> 03:22:02,210
Click Discord.

3362
03:22:04,130 --> 03:22:04,650
Seriously?

3363
03:22:05,910 --> 03:22:07,710
Should we try one more time?

3364
03:22:08,490 --> 03:22:09,930
One last time.

3365
03:22:10,050 --> 03:22:10,550
Oh, dang it.

3366
03:22:10,610 --> 03:22:11,690
I did not mean to press that.

3367
03:22:12,390 --> 03:22:12,910
Map.

3368
03:22:16,080 --> 03:22:17,660
It doesn't say that we got the ending.

3369
03:22:18,160 --> 03:22:19,020
It doesn't say.

3370
03:22:19,160 --> 03:22:19,440
Alright.

3371
03:22:19,440 --> 03:22:22,300
Ok, I exit out of Discord.

3372
03:22:38,410 --> 03:22:39,250
That's it!

3373
03:22:46,350 --> 03:22:47,810
We actually got it!

3374
03:22:49,810 --> 03:22:50,690
It actually worked!

3375
03:22:50,810 --> 03:22:51,690
Wait, who sent that?

3376
03:22:52,150 --> 03:22:53,530
Who sent that in earlier?

3377
03:23:00,750 --> 03:23:02,270
Where are you?

3378
03:23:02,490 --> 03:23:03,470
Who sent that?

3379
03:23:07,530 --> 03:23:08,250
Tisonic!

3380
03:23:08,610 --> 03:23:09,710
Thank you!

3381
03:23:10,750 --> 03:23:12,230
You deserve your credit.

3382
03:23:13,110 --> 03:23:15,610
Thank you so much!

3383
03:23:22,550 --> 03:23:24,070
Look at him so smug.

3384
03:23:24,110 --> 03:23:24,290
Yay!

3385
03:23:26,770 --> 03:23:28,670
Master Bounty Hunter!

3386
03:23:34,910 --> 03:23:36,190
Thank you!

3387
03:23:36,270 --> 03:23:36,670
Thank you!

3388
03:23:41,170 --> 03:23:42,450
We did it!

3389
03:23:42,650 --> 03:23:43,390
We did it!

3390
03:23:43,450 --> 03:23:45,010
And we got the Metal Gear.

3391
03:23:46,570 --> 03:23:49,410
We got the Metal Gear stuff!

3392
03:23:49,830 --> 03:23:51,250
That was so good!

3393
03:23:53,550 --> 03:23:53,910
Yay!

3394
03:23:56,470 --> 03:23:57,810
We can see the JoJo fail.

3395
03:23:57,890 --> 03:23:58,630
It's so long.

3396
03:23:58,970 --> 03:24:01,490
Wait, why is it...Oh, it's because it's what we are on.

3397
03:24:01,570 --> 03:24:01,890
Just kidding.

3398
03:24:02,730 --> 03:24:03,610
I was like, why is it outlined?

3399
03:24:06,690 --> 03:24:08,170
We could finish the JoJo one.

3400
03:24:08,470 --> 03:24:10,330
In fact, while we do that, I will eat.

3401
03:24:11,050 --> 03:24:11,990
We'll do the JoJo.

3402
03:24:12,430 --> 03:24:12,850
Here we go.

3403
03:24:13,910 --> 03:24:15,370
I'll keep eating while you eat JoJo.

3404
03:24:19,070 --> 03:24:23,470
I forgot about the cursed Nihongo.

3405
03:24:34,010 --> 03:24:34,710
What?

3406
03:24:34,990 --> 03:24:35,590
That's crazy.

3407
03:24:45,370 --> 03:24:46,730
They stand now.

3408
03:24:53,150 --> 03:24:55,790
Hontou ni fist ga stop me.

3409
03:24:56,990 --> 03:24:59,370
Hontou ni fist ga stop me.

3410
03:25:13,010 --> 03:25:15,530
This Japanese is killing me.

3411
03:25:19,340 --> 03:25:20,470
Oh my God!

3412
03:25:22,940 --> 03:25:24,430
You're just a man!

3413
03:25:26,030 --> 03:25:28,230
OK, this is where...

3414
03:25:28,230 --> 03:25:29,850
It actually worked!

3415
03:25:35,290 --> 03:25:35,610
What?

3416
03:25:35,610 --> 03:25:35,990
What?

3417
03:25:46,850 --> 03:25:48,970
Oh no, they even got the song!

3418
03:25:49,970 --> 03:25:51,170
Oh my God.

3419
03:25:53,510 --> 03:25:56,850
It doesn't seem right, but I don't know enough about anime to dispute it.

3420
03:25:59,970 --> 03:26:02,470
Oh, it was right at the very end.

3421
03:26:02,530 --> 03:26:03,210
That's so frustrating.

3422
03:26:07,290 --> 03:26:09,630
We had to go through the whole cutscene and then it froze.

3423
03:26:19,270 --> 03:26:22,230
Anyways guys, I think that's where I'm going to stop it today.

3424
03:26:25,190 --> 03:26:26,630
I think that's where I'll stop it today.

3425
03:26:27,930 --> 03:26:28,930
I had a lot of fun!

3426
03:26:34,700 --> 03:26:36,040
Are you going to do a part 2?

3427
03:26:36,140 --> 03:26:37,260
Probably not.

3428
03:26:38,380 --> 03:26:40,860
We got a whole bunch of stuff.

3429
03:26:40,980 --> 03:26:46,430
I know there's a crazy amount of endings and everything, but...

3430
03:26:48,060 --> 03:26:48,980
We got 3.

3431
03:26:49,100 --> 03:26:49,780
I think it's pretty good.

3432
03:26:53,260 --> 03:26:59,600
Sorry about the crashes, but luckily we got a fix in the end.

3433
03:27:00,580 --> 03:27:02,080
This is fun though.

3434
03:27:04,740 --> 03:27:06,120
We got the Wololo.

3435
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:07,120
That was so funny.

3436
03:27:07,280 --> 03:27:08,140
I can't believe it.

3437
03:27:09,560 --> 03:27:10,600
So fun!

3438
03:27:10,760 --> 03:27:11,480
It was so fun.

3439
03:27:13,860 --> 03:27:17,240
And yeah, what a game.

3440
03:27:18,160 --> 03:27:19,980
What a product of it's time.

3441
03:27:20,260 --> 03:27:23,360
But also seeing some of the new additions like FNAF.

3442
03:27:23,580 --> 03:27:24,700
That was so crazy.

3443
03:27:25,080 --> 03:27:26,000
There was something else too.

3444
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:28,160
There was like the...

3445
03:27:28,160 --> 03:27:30,800
The boy.

3446
03:27:32,080 --> 03:27:33,820
All these references make me feel old.

3447
03:27:34,260 --> 03:27:38,320
I'm going to be thinking about 2000's era Newgrounds and NND memes all night.

3448
03:27:39,460 --> 03:27:43,120
Yeah, but where were the Meat and Fuck memes?

3449
03:27:44,240 --> 03:27:45,940
That's peak Newgrounds.

3450
03:27:47,020 --> 03:27:48,160
Where were they?

3451
03:27:48,920 --> 03:27:51,000
The FNAF reference was crazy for it's time.

3452
03:27:52,120 --> 03:27:53,440
He predicted the future.

3453
03:27:59,040 --> 03:27:59,520
Hmm...

3454
03:28:01,100 --> 03:28:01,880
The what?

3455
03:28:02,400 --> 03:28:04,020
You guys don't...you guys know?

3456
03:28:05,420 --> 03:28:06,020
You guys know?

3457
03:28:07,100 --> 03:28:10,000
That was the only thing I played on Newgrounds.

3458
03:28:14,420 --> 03:28:14,800
Um...

3459
03:28:32,930 --> 03:28:35,770
Thank you guys for 100 Stickmin.

3460
03:28:36,570 --> 03:28:37,670
Not Stickman.

3461
03:28:38,410 --> 03:28:38,790
Stickmin.

3462
03:28:40,230 --> 03:28:40,610
Otamito!

3463
03:28:41,470 --> 03:28:42,490
Thank you guys!

3464
03:28:42,610 --> 03:28:44,850
Have a good day, have a good night and I'll see you guys...

3465
03:28:45,690 --> 03:28:47,330
Thanks for the 10 gift in my face!

3466
03:28:47,450 --> 03:28:48,510
I'll see you guys later!

3467
03:28:49,190 --> 03:28:49,950
Bye bye!

3468
03:28:50,030 --> 03:28:50,430
Bye bye!

3469
03:28:50,530 --> 03:28:51,010
Bye bye!

3470
03:28:51,510 --> 03:28:52,170
Thank you!

3471
03:28:52,530 --> 03:28:53,090
Bye bye!
