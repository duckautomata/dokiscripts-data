6
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,890
My mic is all messed up.

7
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,970

8
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,710

16
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,820
That hawk swooping down at the end of last stream sounded like it was out for blood.

17
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:30,100
For those that don't know what they're talking about, you can go watch my unboxing stream of Metal Gear acrylics.

18
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,660
And I got attacked by a hawk.

19
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
Whose name was Mike.

20
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,220
Hyped for some more tell-tale shenanigans.

21
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,900
Whoa, thank you so many people coming back.

22
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,400

Everyone's like, it's the big thing.

31
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,320
People are saying that it might be Smash.

32
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,500
People are saying it might be New Mario Movie.

33
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,820
Baby boy, thank you so much for the fun.

34
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,160

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,920
No, walking dead casualties starting now.

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,240
Yeah.

39
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,340
Everybody will live.

40
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,440
Everybody will live.

41
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,400
Today was pretty hard, but having my OG stream makes it better.

42
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,800
Thank you.

43
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,180
Chibudo, I hope you can relax.

44
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,360
Silk Song.

45
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,300
We've got Tomodachi Live.

46
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,240
We've got Silk Song.

47
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,660
I hope we get more Tomodachi Live news, though.

48
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,920
They only announced it.

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,060
They didn't really say, like, a date or anything before, right?

50
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,740
I hope we get more of that.

51
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,620
Half-Life 3 is definitely going to be announced tomorrow.

52
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,740
For sure, that's the last thing that I could ever manifest.

53
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,080
Is a Half-Life 3.

54
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:18,860
That's...

55
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,840
Tomorrow?

56
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,140

57
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,940

58
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,400
Tomorrow, Half-Life 3.

59
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,820
You heard it here first, folks.

60
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,840
Some of that life is Q1, 2026?

61
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,900
Really?!

62
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,700
Production hotline on the 25th!

63
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,360
Yes!

64
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,280
I did, but unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to...

65
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,760
Oh wait, 25th.

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,380
Hold on, let me check the calendar.

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,260

00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,900

70
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
Oh wait, that's Japan 25th.

71
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes, because TGS Wednesday, Thursday is a business day.

72
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,060
No, Thursday, Friday, Business Day, Saturday.

73
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,860
Wait, am I getting it wrong?

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,540
Saturday, Sunday, open to the public?

75
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,600
Am I getting it wrong?

76
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,440
I don't remember.

77
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,140
But yeah.

78
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,120

Thank you so much.

80
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,180
So I can't say, just so I wanted to say hi.

81
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,920
Oh, good.

82
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,260

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,260
Um, they, like, opened it for everybody or something.

89
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,880
They, like, made it so everybody can get all the stuff, I think.

90
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,260
It's offline app now?

91
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:53,840

Happy birthday!

131
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,210
Wait, this...

132
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,070
Like a card Captor Sakura.

00:12:30,330 --> 00:13:06,110
This Cortez Captor Sakura happy happy birthday happy birthday thank you so much um we made it to savannah and then um then or did we make it to savannah yeah but regardless regardless we learned that clem has been talking to somebody on the radio not yet okay we're on the way we're on The big thing was that the guy that Clem is talking to,

134
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,390
which is kind of crazy.

135
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,070
We're on our way.

136
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,230
We're on the road to Savannah.

137
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,230
Yeah, Duck did not make it.

138
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,370
I'm kind of nervous.

139
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:28,090
Because, you know, I know it's the Walking Dead, but, you know, most media is a little afraid of killing off children.

140
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,810
And I was like, Clem is going to live.

141
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,630
But then Duck died and I was like...

142
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,890
Uh...

143
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,830
Uh...

144
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,530
So...

145
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,970
Of course no spoilers since it's my first time playing.

146
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,470
And, uh...

147
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,070
Yes.

148
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,710
So let's just play.

149
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,010
Play.

150
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

151
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,470
Episode 4, Around Every Corner.

152
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,370
Duck only died because he didn't high-five him.

153
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,350
I don't believe that.

154
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,390
I don't believe that.

155
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,910
Yeah, objective is to protect Clem.

156
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,870
Previously on the Walking Dead.

157
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,410
Shut up, Carly.

158
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,090
Oh, this was crazy.

159
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,750
This was so insane.

160
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,630
I can't believe this was- Oh my gosh, sorry.

161
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,670
I forgot it was gonna happen.

162
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,190
Oh no, just then.

163
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,530
Oh my gosh, it's so crazy.

164
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,630
I don't know much about you, folks.

165
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,190
But I can tell you, sure as the sun's gonna come up to- Oh, well!

166
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,270
Thank you so much for the thank you, dude!

167
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,930
I guess, and that girl ain't good.

168
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,130
Sarah's happy birthday!

169
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:43,910
So many birthdays!

170
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,570
Happy, happy birthday!

171
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,510
I'll do it.

172
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,110
Oh, and then we killed Doug.

173
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,530
We need to help find a boat.

174
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,930
It's our best bet at safety.

175
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,050
Okay, but we'll be in Savannah, and my parents were in Savannah.

176
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,190
Okay, we'll look for them.

177
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,370
I was the one giving the bandits supplies.

178
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,370
What?

179
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,210
And then, Ben!

180
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,050
It's only fault.

181
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,270
We gotta jump!

182
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:05,710
Wow!

183
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:05,890
What?

184
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:06,790
No way!

185
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,710
And then this guy almost died.

186
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:11,330
Shit!

187
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,830
Can't wait for you to get to Savannah, Clementine.

188
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,730
I got your parents right here.

189
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,530
And you'd be sure to find me, whether League wants you to or not.

190
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,310
Now, what I did...

191
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,750
Oh, the fuck.

192
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,890
This is so... This is not...

193
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,730
Episode 3 was so insane.

194
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,150
I... I... I am so...

195
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,710
It was so great.

196
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,230
Crazy!

197
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,130
Chapter 3 was so crazy!

198
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,090
Oh my gosh.

199
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,410
A lot happened despite feeling so short.

200
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,610
Yeah.

201
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,930
The Walking Minky.

202
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,130
Poor Kacha didn't even get a mention.

203
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,110
We just lumped her and ducking together, I suppose.

204
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,890
It's our welcome back!

205
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:03,770
Thank you.

206
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,710
Thank you guys so much for 7.

207
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,750
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

208
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,770
Savannah!

209
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,130
Is this Savannah?

210
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,690
Looks Savannah-like.

211
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,890
I've always wanted to go to Savannah because I've always heard that they have good ghost places.

212
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,570
Stop yelling!

213
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,090
We need to be quiet!

214
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,470
Hella haunted?

215
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,830
I'll be able to talk to people.

216
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,030
Oh,

217
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,380
he's keeping the walkie.

218
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,800
Can't I just hold it?

219
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,480
Um, not now, Clementine.

220
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,260
Just for a little while.

221
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,080
I need you to focus.

222
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,100
We're getting real close to where my mom and dad are.

223
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,080
I need you to lock in, Clem.

224
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,200
I need you to focus.

225
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,800
Lock in.

226
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,160
Keep your attention on the street.

227
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,540
Okay, sorry.

228
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,560
Pao's onede.

229
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,240
His leg's pretty bad.

230
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,620
Uh-oh.

231
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,220
I'm fine.

232
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,580
You're not fine.

233
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,840
You need to rest.

234
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
He needs to rest.

235
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,100
You need to rest.

236
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,800
Kenny, how much further?

237
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,000
Kenny, how much farther to the riverfront?

238
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,360
Yeah.

239
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,580
There should be just a few more blocks up ahead.

240
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,220
And there'll be boats there?

241
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,780
There sure as hell better be.

242
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,980
There'll be boats.

243
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,180
Have to be.

244
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,540
Have to be.

245
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,040
After.

246
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,920
It's going to be okay.

247
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,300
Kenny knows what he's doing.

248
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,420
Okay, Ben.

249
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,600
What the hell?

250
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,140
Oh, that's bad timing.

251
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,500
Oh.

252
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,760
These are automated?

253
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,760
Maybe the city's not so dead after all.

00:17:41,440 --> 00:18:06,880

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,300
Did they do that on purpose?

263
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,700
Did they get the zombies in?

264
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,840

Yeah.

271
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,430
Ew.

272
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,810
Oh my gosh.

273
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,010
Yeah.

274
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,390
I got him.

275
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,590
Easy peasy.

276
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,330
Too close.

277
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,570
Don't you think?

278
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,410
Ben!

279
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,570
No!

280
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,450
Ben, help her.

281
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,610
Ben help her.

282
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,690
Ben help her.

283
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,290
Ben?

284
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,850
Why is it not getting that guy?

285
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,510
Wait, I was trying to get that guy.

286
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,010
It wasn't getting that guy.

287
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,890
You move the hell out of here.

288
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,430
I'll catch up with you.

289
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,370
So loud all of a sudden.

290
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,430
Did I keep missing?

291
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,130
My bad.

292
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,470
Ben?

293
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,450
Move your asses!

294
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,810
River Streets right up ahead!

295
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,070
That's not all.

296
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,290
Minto will remember them.

297
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,590
I'll give me a fucking break.

298
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,770
Minto will remember that.

299
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,450
Chuck!

300
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,630
No, Chuck.

301
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,430
Oh my god, Chuck.

302
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,550
Shit, he's in trouble.

303
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,530
We gotta help him.

304
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,770
These things are not that fast.

305
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,870
I don't understand.

306
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,630
Like, I know there's a lot of them.

307
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,650
I know there's a lot, but like...

308
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,810
Oh, oh, Chuck.

309
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,410
Chuck.

310
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,870
Minto remembers everything.

313
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,330
Let me see if I can find this a way here.

314
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,030
Yeah, yeah.

315
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,910
Also, Ben, what the hell?

316
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,110
I'm gonna kill you.

317
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,710
Ben.

318
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:32,910
What the hell?

319
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,550
Um, yeah, about- About what happened back there on the street.

320
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,290
I know.

321
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,610
I don't know what happened.

322
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,190
I just froze up.

323
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,670
No, you didn't.

324
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,030
You ran!

325
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,030
Hasn't that ever happened to you?

326
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,790
Just hear what I'm saying to you.

327
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,110
You put that girl in danger again.

328
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,730
It won't be walkers you have to worry about.

329
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,330
Ooh.

330
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,630
I hear you.

331
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,950
I hate him.

332
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,190
I hate him.

333
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,110
Think we can get in through one of these windows?

334
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,590
Man, I don't think so.

335
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,730
Whoever owned this place had them all barred up.

336
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,730
Wow, they're like crazy.

337
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,570
Looks pretty solid.

338
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,410
Yeah, like crazy boarded up.

339
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,490
Justified hate.

340
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,390
How do you think Kenny's holding out?

341
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,730
I don't think this is the time for our chit chat.

342
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,610
All he can think about is finding a boat.

343
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,790
He definitely doesn't want to talk about Kacha and Duck, at least not with me.

344
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,050
No one wants to talk to you, Ben.

345
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,150
I'm going to go check things out.

346
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,470
It's time to take 67 cents from Ben.

347
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,340
Clem, don't stand so close to the gate.

348
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,220
You're worrying me.

349
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,500
Do you think the dead people saw us come back here?

350
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,200
Are they going to find us?

351
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,100
Uh, try not to worry.

352
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,200
Try not to worry.

353
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,660
Even if they saw us, they can't get in here.

354
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,400
Yeah, true.

355
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:49,780
We did.

356
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,980
Why can't they?

357
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,780
We're a lot smarter than they are.

358
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,680
They're just like dumb animals.

359
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,260
Stupid animals.

360
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,260
He used to have a pet hamster.

361
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,780
One night he figured out how to open the door to his cage.

362
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,340
And when we woke up, he'd eaten half a box of cookies.

363
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,480
Oh, I thought she was going to say he ate himself.

364
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,520
Hamsters are so strange.

365
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,940
This time we're the cookies.

366
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,860
Just stay away from the gate.

367
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,580
Never let Ben have anything nice.

368
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,860
Yeah, stay away from the gate.

369
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,820
Hamsters, like, will, like, eat them, eat their friends.

370
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:31,580
Hamsters, well, hamsters are, hamsters are really, uh-oh, hamsters are no good.

371
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,160
How's he looking?

372
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,180
I'm alright.

373
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,680
You're not alright.

374
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,140
You've reopened your wound, you're losing blood, and God only knows what might have gotten in there.

375
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,560
It could be infected.

376
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,440
It could be...

377
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,480
No offense, but you really need to work on your bedside manner.

378
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,700
Um, we'll take care of it.

379
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,060
She's just worried about you, ma'am.

380
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,380
Yeah.

381
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,160
Don't worry.

382
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,240
We're gonna get you fixed up in no time.

383
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:53,640

Doghouse.

386
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,580
Aw.

387
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,560
Just a doghouse.

388
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,320
Aw.

389
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,280
Fountain.

390
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,420
I'm not thirsty enough to drink that yet.

391
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:38,880
Ew.

392
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,800
I hope not.

393
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,780
Let's see.

394
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,760
Oh, the dog?

395
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,500
The pet door.

396
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,460
What's this?

397
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,920
Looks like there's some kind of pet door here.

398
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,780
Crawl through.

399
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,720
I tried it already.

400
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,660
That's lock two.

401
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,200
What?

402
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:55,920
What?

403
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:28,240
ever heard of a locked doggy just just kick it in my neighborhood wouldn't just like that it's it's radio control my pet hamster was a collar with a chip in it so the door only opens when the dog gets close to it no shit every day's a school day just kick it in all right so where's the dog they didn't bury the dog with the collar right actually these are these i've heard of stuff like like they make cat bulls like this or Apologize to my hamster.

404
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,880
I'm sorry, Splunkaboo.

405
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,660
I'm sorry.

406
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:43,020
Like, they make cat bowls like this where the cat, like, it reacts to the chip in them and so that each cat can only eat their own food.

407
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,120
I think anyone's inside?

408
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,040
I don't think so.

409
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,700
They wouldn't have boarded it up if they were going to stay in.

410
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,480
Did they weigh in yet?

411
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,840
Doors locked up tight.

412
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:38,940
Too heavy to force it without making a whole lot or look at Hamtaro the same way I wasn't wrong though I ain't seeing it you think maybe someone's still inside nah we'd have heard from him by now all the racket we're making but whoever was here did a pretty good job fortifying it nice place to hold up we can just figure out how to get in hey are you holding up man Lee I appreciate the interest but I don't think talking about my feelings right now is gonna help us get inside this house okay maybe you should have a look around see what you can find okay time to dig up the dog this is so sad i don't want to do this i really don't want to do this though do you have a chip in your collar too meinto

413
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:54,680
cat chips did they come in ranch flavor wait what did he say looks like something was buried here yeah the dog he's not in the house is he empty Oh, that would have been too easy.

414
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,740
Oh, oh, we're doing squats.

415
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,060
Okay, we got to find something to use to dig it up, I guess.

416
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,900
But where?

417
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,040
I didn't see anything like a...

418
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,060
Oh, there it is.

419
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,560
The shovel is never not useful.

420
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,640
Yeah, Chuck had the shovel!

421
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:44,920
Chuck had the shovel Okay I could we could have used our hands Be careful Digging up dead things isn't what it used to be You know what I mean Zombie dog From the grave arises Do we ever expect Okay maybe we don't get so close to it If we think it's a zombie dog

422
00:27:49,380 --> 00:28:10,860
Stay away Nothing Go over and sit with Chris Don't over Okay Yeah but I want to just do what I say okay yeah oh no we're trying to save your feelings oh oh god the smell he you don't have to imagine it

423
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:23,440
uh I don't think that thing is dead oh my god must have belonged to someone well of course

424
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:44,740
can't get it off okay that is not cool are you okay I'm fine honey it's just the smell are you sure you're I said I'm fine okay

425
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,680
can we re-burry it I don't beat that anymore I'm done digging up dead dogs for today.

426
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,960
I think we should re-burry him, no!

427
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,020
Everyone hated that.

428
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,020
There goes

429
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,710
nothing.

430
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,650
Yes!

431
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:14,990
God damn!

432
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,470
You see anything in there?

433
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,370
No.

434
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,590
Looks like it's been empty a while.

435
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:25,290
Nice.

436
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,250
Uh-oh.

437
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,070
It's getting louder.

438
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,030
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

439
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,010
Okay, let me see if I can reach up in there.

440
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,690
Be careful, man.

441
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:38,230
Okay.

442
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,030
Uh-oh, there's a lot of noise.

443
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,030
It's no good.

444
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,090
I can't get it.

445
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,450
Here, let me try.

446
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,350
I think I can...

447
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,390
Oh!

448
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,050
Oh!

449
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,010
Clem!

450
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,250
What do you see?

451
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,610
Clem, what do you see in there?

452
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:53,330
Clem?

453
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,370
She just crawled in so fast!

454
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,310
Look at...

455
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,610
She's so smart.

456
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,010
Good job, Clem.

457
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,810
Yeah, way to go.

458
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,630
I did good, right?

459
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,570
Yes, you did.

460
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,910
You did good.

461
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,370
Can we maybe have this conversation inside?

462
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,250
Yeah, Clem!

463
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:19,390
She didn't even like, she went in with the mission and she accomplished it as quickly as she did it.

464
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:19,930
It was clean.

465
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,410
It was great.

466
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,130
Also, Ben trying to be helpful.

467
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,730
It's too late for that.

468
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,470
What if Clem had died, we never would have been able to get inside.

469
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:32,730
Stupid.

470
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,250
Shut the door?

471
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:35,990
Thank you.

472
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,830
Wow, nice place.

473
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,310
Sorry, sorry.

474
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,490
No, it's okay.

475
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:48,790
I'm good.

476
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,090
Clem is worth 1,000 bends.

477
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:52,750
Thanks, babe.

478
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,430
I don't think he's going to make it.

479
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,430
Oh, that's a dog.

480
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,590
I thought that was like an alien child.

481
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,130
The rat person and their family.

482
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,670
When were you going to tell us about the radio?

483
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,510
I didn't.

484
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:03,910
What?

485
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,390
That it's working.

486
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,970
That there's someone else on the other end of that thing.

487
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,550
You didn't think that might have been worth sharing with the rest of us?

488
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:11,830
I only found out.

489
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,730
I was going to tell you.

490
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,690
Kenny and I only found out yesterday.

491
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,230
I was honest.

492
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,630
So both of you were keeping it from the rest of us.

493
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,830
Who gives a shit about the damn radio?

494
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,230
I'm more worried about whoever it was out there ringing that bell and bringing the dead down on top of us.

495
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,890
It's like they didn't want us to make it to the river.

496
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,050
What makes you think it's not the same person?

497
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:38,330
was close enough to see us in the street and you can see anyone else other than the guy in the bell tower.

498
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,870
Because that doesn't make a lick of damn sense.

499
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,050
Why would they bring out the dead like that and then try to warn us about it?

500
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,210
How much sense does anything make anymore?

501
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,830
In case you haven't noticed, there's a lot of twisted folks out there they're stalking us.

502
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,930
Whoever it was, seems like they're following us.

503
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,990
But Ben's sleep at the doghouse.

504
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,750
All the more reason to get on a damn boat where we can't be followed.

505
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,210
going back out there anytime soon.

506
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,810
Omeed needs to rest.

507
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,150
Let's rest up.

508
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,570
I think everybody just needs to rest up.

509
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,570
I think we could all use a little time to rest up and gather our thoughts, Kiki.

510
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,310
At least until those walkers outside wander off and Omeed's feeling better.

511
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,690
He best feel better quick.

512
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,750
I ain't gonna wait around here too long.

513
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,730
Kenny, there's no need to be such a jerk anymore.

514
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,650
Your family's dead.

515
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,850
Please seem secure at least.

516
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,790
I'll feel better when we know that for sure.

517
00:32:33,610 --> 00:33:04,730
to check the whole house yes all right fine you and me you'll take the upstairs didn't even consider looking for Chuck Chuck make sure you check every door understand okay I mean such logic I mean yeah can I help what if there's another locked door look how excited she is I think you've been helpful enough for one day kiddo why don't you just see if Kristen Oh me need anything okay okay you can't crawl through every door little Clem Who's Chuck?

518
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,030
Well, let's examine the cabinets.

519
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:08,970
The dog food.

520
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,950
They're all empty.

521
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,470
I think this place is clear.

522
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,510
For real, though.

523
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,630
Like, even the dog food is empty.

524
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,610
This place has been...

525
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,730
Like, picked apart.

526
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,610
I hope we never get desperate enough for food that this starts looking appetizing.

527
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,050
So...

528
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,590
When I was a weird...

529
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,190
Whisp.

530
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,230
I'm not that hungry.

531
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,850
Signs I need to finish checking the downstairs.

532
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,790
I had dogs.

533
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,710
And they had a treat called popcorn.

534
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,430
But like, why would you name it that?

535
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,330
Nothing.

536
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,670
Water's off.

537
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,590
Why would you name it something that sounds so delicious?

538
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:02,150
And not expect me to eat it.

539
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,790
No power.

540
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,350
Yeah, like popcorn, but popcorn.

541
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,950
My dog, Walter!

542
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,410
This is so sad.

543
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,590
This is why you're into stale popcorn.

544
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,250
It might be.

545
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,490
Even the fridge is empty.

546
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,590
All cleaned out.

547
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,490
Yeah, like they didn't die here.

548
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,630
They like took everything and...

549
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,010
Were moonwalking?

550
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,490
They took everything and ran after Walter died.

551
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,390
There's a zombie in the clock.

552
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,630
Must have stopped working a while ago.

553
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,090
There's a zombie in the clock.

554
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,950
There's a zombie in the clock.

555
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:54,030
Whoever cleared this place out left behind two bottles of whiskey.

556
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,830
Looks like someone didn't have their priorities straight.

557
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,650
How's it coming?

558
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,610
I'm looking!

559
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:32,810
take one probably not the best idea right now never mind I need to stay frosty frosty looks expensive and heavy doubt any looters would be able to hold that thing too far now I want to make puppy chow no don't eat don't eat dog food hello hey guys how's the house looking not done searching the first floor yet but so far so good About this boat plan.

560
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,090
What do you guys think about this plan at Kinney's?

561
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,850
The guy's losing it.

562
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,370
Look, Lee, I know he's your friend and all.

563
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,570
But you need to be careful.

564
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,170
That man is on the edge.

565
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,690
And I don't know if I want to be around when he goes over it.

566
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:45,950
Kinney's solid.

567
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,350
It's just been through a lot.

568
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:47,970
That's all.

569
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,410
I hope you're right.

570
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,030
For all our sakes.

571
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,910
You and your core and obsession.

572
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,930
Puppy Chow is muddy buddies.

573
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,430
Wait, you guys are just saying things.

574
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:33,650

575
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:34,590
Yeah.

576
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,070
Thanks, Lee.

577
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,190
You're welcome.

578
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,530
How about Clem?

579
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,470
Hold it up, okay?

580
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,610
I hope this house is safe.

581
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,170
Have you checked all the rooms to make sure?

582
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,010
I'm working on it.

583
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,510
No, but I'll take care of it.

584
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,790
Yeah, maybe we should go grab the shovel.

585
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,170
So that we know that we have a little weapon, you know?

586
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,530
Let's check this room.

587
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,370
Oh.

588
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,770
Oh, we have a gun.

589
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,270
That's true.

590
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,310
Jesus!

591
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,710
Oh, my God.

592
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:09,690
It's a mop.

593
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,030
What?

594
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,070
What happened?

595
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,170
It's nothing.

596
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,110
Just nothing.

597
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,130
Okay.

598
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,190
That's like...

599
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,510
Wait, so it's a storage closet?

600
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,810
Because it's like the biggest storage closet.

601
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,070
The doors are humongous.

602
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,950
I think I saw another door.

603
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,310
Yeah, another door over here.

604
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,630
We got some paintings.

605
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,370
Oh!

606
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,510
Not exactly my style.

607
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,390
Spooky.

608
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,310
We have two doors.

609
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,810
Let's open the small one first.

610
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:46,870
Ah!

611
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,050
Ha!

612
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,130
Bathroom.

613
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,310
Nothing hiding in here.

614
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,190
Okay, but check for...

615
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,090
medical supplies.

616
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,770
Just one more to check.

617
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,170
Oh, the dog.

618
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,970
Rich person house.

619
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:10,370
I know.

620
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,990
This place is fancy.

621
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,430
Huh?

622
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,330
Another closet.

623
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,590
That's the last room.

624
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,630
Looks like downstairs is secure.

625
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,270
Okay.

626
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,130
Well, the place ain't got much.

627
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,530
We should be okay here for a while.

628
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,810
At least until it quits down outside.

629
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:37,310
Good.

630
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,230
Thanks.

631
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:40,750
Amid?

632
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,370
Is he okay?

633
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:42,910
Are you alive?

634
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:43,330
No.

635
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,470
But I'm really worried his leg might have gotten infected.

636
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,890
Don't suppose he turned up any meds while you were poking around.

637
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,950
I didn't even look!

638
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:51,470
Just dog food.

639
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,310
And there's some whiskey in the back.

640
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,270
Wait, you could do that.

641
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,150
Pour that on the wound, Renault?

642
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,350
Isn't that alcohol?

643
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:57,770
Isn't that alcohol?

644
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,650
She knows who the man on her radio is.

645
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,110
It's okay, honey.

646
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,030
You can tell us.

647
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,950
Who is he?

648
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,030
What does he want?

649
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,810
We want answers, Clementine!

650
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,550
We want answers!

651
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,770
Go ahead, Clem.

652
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:10,490
It's okay.

653
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,310
You're not in any trouble.

654
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,950
It's just a friend.

655
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,470
I don't think he wants to hurt us.

656
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,010
What has he been saying to you?

657
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,130
What have you been saying to him?

658
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,510
Oh, I told him I was trying to find my parents and that they were in Savannah.

659
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,210
He really seems nice.

660
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,350
I think he wants to help me find them.

661
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,410
Clementine, honey, trust me.

662
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,570
That's not what he wants.

663
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,450
He...

664
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:33,810
Lee?

665
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,910
Uh-oh.

666
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,190
Yes, Ben?

667
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,430
Something that...

668
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,550
Lee, you need to get up here now.

669
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,670
What's wrong?

670
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,670
It's Kenny.

671
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:41,770
Kenny?

672
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,590
Kenny?

673
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,150
Wait, is this...

674
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,170
Kenny said he thought he heard something up there.

675
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,390
Went to go look.

676
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,210
He's up there?

677
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,150
No, Kenny's alive.

678
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,470
I can't get him to come down.

679
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,410
Kenny, say something.

680
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,230
Stay here.

681
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:06,860
Oh.

682
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh, Kenny?

683
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:11,860
Kenny?

684
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,360
Oh.

685
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,500
I hear flies.

686
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,360
Oh.

687
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:21,960
Kenny?

688
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,420
Wait, what's wrong with him?

689
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,000
Oh, he's alive.

690
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:26,840
Okay.

691
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,100
Kenny?

692
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,260
You okay, man?

693
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,840
What's wrong?

694
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
I hear- Oh, Jesus.

695
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,460
What the hell is that?

696
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,440
What is this?

697
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,440
Oh.

698
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:47,840
Oh.

699
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,540
Oh.

700
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,520
What?

701
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,360
I was gonna say it looks like duck.

702
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,820
Oh my god, no.

703
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,620
She's like starved up here.

704
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,040
Guess he must have been hiding out up here.

705
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,760
Starved to death.

706
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,240
Jesus Christ.

707
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,820
I don't know if I can, Lee.

708
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,540
Couldn't do it before.

709
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,220
Can't do it now.

710
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,400
I mean...

711
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,160
Let's just leave.

712
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,380
We don't have to do this right now.

713
00:41:29,640 --> 00:42:01,060
could just maybe we should just get out of here you can't hurt anyone yeah you can't even stand up walk away i don't know if i can do that either i guess we could i mean like i can't i can't do anything you can give the gun to kenny no way when you say kenny it sounds like a south park character kenny poor kid must have tried to hide out of here until he starved to death This could have been clean time.

714
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,060
Oh, don't say that.

715
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,380
Don't say that.

716
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,640
I could shoot him.

717
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,700
I could bash him.

718
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,160
I could stomp him.

719
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,380
Oh my gosh.

720
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,080
Pick your poison, kid.

721
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,480
Wait, if I get so close, is he gonna grab me?

722
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,140
He doesn't even have the strength.

723
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,540
Kid.

724
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,540
Kid.

725
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,380
Kid.

726
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,260
Why did he take off his clothes?

727
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,780
I don't understand.

728
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,580
I don't understand.

729
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,160
Don't waste ammo.

730
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,700
I agree.

731
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,360
I agree.

732
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,860
I think we're going to have to stomp him like a little bug.

733
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,560
Um.

734
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,300
It's hot in the attic.

735
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,160
Okay, that's fair.

736
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,980
I don't like the noises it's making.

737
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,120
Okay, let's just bash him in.

738
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:36,630
Well, Kenny, we could only give him the but we're gonna not we're not gonna we're gonna conserve ammo nice and easy okay oh my god you chose to do it yourself we should bury him i'll take care of it oh we put so much on ourselves you know like lee takes on so much

739
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,260
like everyone is going through it but so is lee You know, it's so sad

740
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,320
He's very supportive he is he's a good guy

741
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:10,360
Oh, I guess it's oh he's gonna be with this dog

742
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,190
So sad

743
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:55,550
look at boy okay if you didn't get a good enough view before i suppose it's so sad

744
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,580
it is with this puppy

745
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:13,240
oh i gotta do it myself okay Come on.

746
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,500
They did this back in ancient times, burying the owner and dog together.

747
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,300
Why do I have to keep doing it?

748
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,630
I don't understand.

749
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,150
Is she disappointed?

750
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,290
But she'll close the door on.

751
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:55,890
Oh my gosh.

752
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,050
I'll just keep going.

753
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:57,630
Okay.

754
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:01,850
Just sad.

755
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,310
Cover his sock.

756
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,510
Oh, my God.

757
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:12,790
Oh, my God.

758
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:13,630
Oh.

759
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,240
That was the most horror thing that has happened.

760
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,440
That's a real person.

761
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,980
That was...

762
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,800
Who are you?

763
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:25,200
Who are you?

764
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,260
What the hell do you want from us?

765
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,920
Lee, what's going on?

766
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,620
Like, the most horror thing that happened this entire game.

767
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:52,500
someone was watching someone standing there by the fence watching us a walker no too fast took off like a bat out of hell when i spotted him was it a man or a woman didn't get a good enough look what does it matter i'm wondering if it's the same guy who's been following us the guy on the radio

768
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:56,900
kenny kenny i'm fine i just i'm fine what's all the ruckus I wonder if we had let Kenny do it I can't be sure it ran off before I could get a good look you know I don't like this one bit and then had his little his like a more sense of peace walkers are one thing but the thought of someone out there actually stalking us alright that's it we've stuck around here long enough it's time to get back on track time to get down to the river and find ourselves a boat I don't know if O'Mead's well enough to move well he better get ready because I'm going down to River Street right now wait let's yeah as soon as she's ready to go supplies supplies supplies we only check the house to make sure it's secure we didn't really toss the place we're low on food water meds ammo we should make sure we would have meds before we move out we would have meds if someone I'm done with this house we came to this city to find the boat and that's just what I'm gonna do maybe it's not such a idea to check the place

769
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,040
I said I'm done with this house deserved

770
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:56,000
we can do both Kenny you take one last look around a place grab anything that looks useful while me and Kenny go down to the river to get us a boat oh wait can't I come my mom and dad can't be far now maybe we can look for them on the to the river stay here and help i think it'd be best if you stayed here with ben i need you to watch out for omead and krista help them get ready to move out you said i'm supposed to always stay close to you i know it's just this once sometimes we all have to put aside what we want for the good of the group hey don't worry i'll be back before you know it okay no way wait oh no somebody's gonna who's gonna die then we'll head out omead's gonna die Omid's gonna turn into a zombie.

771
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,500
Oh god, somebody's gonna die.

772
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,500
We're gonna die.

773
00:48:58,680 --> 00:48:59,400
Who's gonna die?

774
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,800
So you're just gonna leave me on the bench here?

775
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,660
Um, you're not reliable.

776
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,120
No offense, Ben.

777
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,740
Uh, keep an eye.

778
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,600
I'm worried about Omid.

779
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,680
He's in bad shape.

780
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,440
I need you to stay here.

781
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:12,800
Yeah.

782
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,700
Keep an eye on him.

783
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,680
He's got Krista for that.

784
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,620
If it comes down to it, I can't rely on Krista to do what has to be done.

785
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,100
Now with Clementine in the same house.

786
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,820
You understand what I'm saying?

787
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,340
You have not proved yourself to be reliable.

788
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,360
Oh, we're counting on you.

789
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,460
You can count on me.

790
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,120
When have we been able to count on you all those other times that we needed to count on you?

791
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,520
Ben!

792
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,540
Counting on Ben infected.

793
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:48,520
Creepy.

794
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,780
Creepy, creepy, creepy.

795
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,360
Sorry, guys.

796
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,640
I'm gonna blow my nose.

797
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,220
Hopefully, there's no QTEs.

798
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:15,510
Don't mute!

799
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:16,450
Oh, my gosh.

800
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:18,170
Okay, fine.

801
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,050
Ben lied as easily as he breathed.

802
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,670
Maybe he's turning over a new leaf.

803
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:30,110
In the one hour that we were in that home.

804
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:32,890
Keep an eye out for Chuck.

805
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,270
Keep your eye out for Chuck.

806
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,290
You might be waiting for us around here.

807
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,590
Yeah.

808
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:37,830
Yeah, sure.

809
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,270
Okay, Kenny, I know you don't care about Chuck.

810
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:41,830
Chuck at all.

811
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:42,630
Son of a bitch.

812
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,670
That bastard's fucking with us again.

813
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:45,770
It's another trap.

814
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:46,550
No, listen.

815
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,370
That's not the same bell as before.

816
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:49,830
This one's further off.

817
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,750
Whatever it is, it's gonna get the dead moving over there.

818
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,170
I'd count on Minto mental math before I count on Ben.

819
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:56,170
Uh oh.

820
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,470
Oh, they're going that way.

821
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:00,590
Why is she crawling?

822
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:03,750
What in the hell is going on?

823
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,630
Why are there posters for mosquitoes?

824
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,370
Did they think the virus spread through mosquitoes?

825
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:13,310
Uh, maybe they're doing us a favor, yeah.

826
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,550
The person ringing that bell might be doing us a favor.

827
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,610
She got that doll dinner.

828
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,950
I'll ring their motherfucking bell for them.

829
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:21,750
Good one.

830
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:26,810
Come on, keep up, Krista.

831
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,210
Wait, Krista's the other lady's name.

832
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:32,210
She just looks like a Christine or something.

833
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:33,770
Keep up!

834
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:35,870
Jessica.

835
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,730
Still nothing moving behind us.

836
00:51:41,290 --> 00:52:12,090
think we're oh my god what's wrong what is it the boats there's no boats there's got to be a boat there's got to be there was one right there um oh shoot uh kenny man i don't think so maybe we need to come up with a new plan this is the plan it's the only one we've got there's one right Pissing on it in front of everyone like you did back at the house ain't exactly helping screw you.

837
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:18,110
I ain't giving up that easy Kenny Kenny dear.

838
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,470
It's time to What what about this one right there?

839
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:25,370
Oh god.

840
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,330
Oh no, it's flooded.

841
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,810
Oh my gosh.

842
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:28,610
Oh no.

843
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,590
Oh no This one might still be salvageable.

844
00:52:32,830 --> 00:53:08,850
Oh Nope Kenny get a grip this boy boat is totally fun it's aft oh yeah know a lot about boats do you tell you what if i ever need an expert opinion on american history i'll be sure to ask but how about you leave the nautical shit to me hey you don't make fun of my career my hobbies kenny i'll check it out you look further along the waterfront maybe there's something at the other end the poor guy this one should split up too far we don't have to see that telescope you can see all the way Life is spiraling.

845
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,590
See what you can find.

846
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,350
Okay, Kenny, those cost money.

847
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,570
Unfortunately, even though the world is...

848
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,030
is... is... is...

849
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:22,570
F to hell.

850
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:25,530
We...

851
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:26,090
Oh my god.

852
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:27,170
Whoa!

853
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,570
We still have to pay money.

854
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:30,270
We're still...

855
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:32,470
Keep out.

856
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:33,270
Wait, what was this one?

857
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:34,630
The boards.

858
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:38,570
Got a quarter.

859
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,830
Maybe we kept the 67 cents.

860
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:46,330
Oh, we really just walked all the way up there.

861
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,510
Looks like the whole city has been boarded up for all the good it did.

862
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,310
What was there?

863
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:54,910
Ah!

864
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,830
I think here, here, here.

865
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:57,970
We'll get some money.

866
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:59,410
It's an old cash register.

867
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:01,610
That much use these days.

868
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,530
Except for when we have to pay for that thing.

869
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,130
An abandoned newsstand.

870
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:10,450
Okay.

871
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,530
A-A-J.

872
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,730
What the hell are these markings?

873
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:21,210
Okay, so I kind of know some of this.

874
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:36,770
So I watched something recently about, like, hurricanes, and how they would, like, when they went and checked the houses for people, they would put markings like this.

875
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:43,130
So it would be, like, two people, probably one dead, one alive.

876
00:54:43,150 --> 00:55:09,790
or stuff like that is kind of what the what the markings are like yeah yeah today I learned yeah is this meant to be some kind of warning or do something like this yeah this is kind of metal I like this part

877
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:19,870
I didn't think they were still alive.

878
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,470
Are these all bodies?

879
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:28,940
Holy wow.

880
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,460
I'm not going to shoot it.

881
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,500
That's crazy.

882
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:38,860
Raven, oh no.

883
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,360
I don't want to go back.

884
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,120
I don't want to go back.

885
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,700
Oh my gosh, there's one down here too.

886
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,700
If I get close enough, will they grab me?

887
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,060
No.

888
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,120
This is so cool!

889
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,580
Oh, there's a guy here too!

890
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,400
Hey, hey, hi!

891
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:55,820
Oh,

892
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,080
there's more markings here.

893
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,380
So this one...

894
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,080
Oh, wait.

895
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,480
Let's see.

896
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,300
Could be military tags, but what do they mean?

897
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:08,820
Oh.

898
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,560
I don't know what the numbers are anymore.

899
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,560
But, but I'm not wrong for like the...

900
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,420
Well, the hurricane stuff.

901
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,760
That is what they did.

902
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,160
Okay, it doesn't seem there's any...

903
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,500
Is this a...

904
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:23,720
No?

905
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,120
Okay.

906
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:29,920
The numbers!

907
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,240
What did I mean?

908
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,620
But also, there's like 8 AJ.

909
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,840
That could be...

910
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,100
Uh, like the...

911
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,000
The person that...

912
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,520
I don't know.

913
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,840
I was gonna say the initials of the person that...

914
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,900
Checked the place?

915
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,120
But...

916
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:48,580
I don't know.

917
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,220
I don't know.

918
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,380
You are right about the numbers.

919
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,100
I am!

920
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,040
Stay out.

921
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,700
Stay out.

922
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,920
That's a lot of bodies.

923
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:02,540
Great.

924
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,020
Needs a quarter to one.

925
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,660
I knew it.

926
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,920
I knew it.

927
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,480
Why couldn't we get the quarter before?

928
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,660
Maybe the officer's ID.

929
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,060
Ah, maybe, maybe, maybe.

930
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:15,580
Right?

931
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,040
Oh.

932
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:51,120
I bet Kenny looted whatever his name's body and took the 67 cents I think Kenny took it number knowledge rocks us like hurricane look at the truck someone must have been trying to back their boat into the water I am.

933
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,100
Larry.

934
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,480
Kenny, you got a quarter?

935
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,280
Don't have a lot of use for small change these days.

936
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,500
Maybe you can find one on the street somewhere.

937
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,300
Okay.

938
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,540
I'll check under the dumpster.

939
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,380
Or I didn't look this way.

940
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,200
What's over here?

941
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,860
Oh, newspaper machine maybe?

942
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,620
Looks like it's still intact.

943
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,840
Oh, you can do it.

944
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,300
Locked.

945
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:23,420
Figures.

946
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,980
Traded for some bottle caps.

947
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:29,660
Wow.

948
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,280
Looks like this thing has been stripped clean.

949
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,520
Survival of the Minties.

950
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,300
Wow.

951
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,860
Wait, they have trolleys in Savannah.

952
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,740
So cute.

953
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,840
I want to ride one.

954
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:44,980
Oh, I see how you are.

955
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,920
I see the rail now.

956
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,620
I want to ride one.

957
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,140
I've always wanted to ride like a street trolley before.

958
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,100
Cash your counter.

959
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,740
I don't think there was anything on the counter.

960
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,000
Let's go check the alleyway.

961
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,560
There's gotta be a reason we can go through here.

962
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:01,680
No?

963
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:02,360
Right?

964
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,320
Check the dumpster?

965
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,080
Nothing, really?

966
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:05,520
Okay.

967
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,120
What state does this take place in?

968
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,820
This takes place in Georgia.

969
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,040
Always been too shy to ask for birthday wishes from anyone in previous years.

970
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,660
Good op.

971
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,300
Doing it for the first time in six years.

972
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,140
Happy birthday, Korofi!

973
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,100
Happy, happy birthday!

974
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,600
Happy birthday!

975
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,800
You think I have to kill this guy to search his butt?

976
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,440
Better not.

977
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:35,840
Oh.

978
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,100
Okay, you're right.

979
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,400
I was right the first time.

980
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,280
Can I search your butt?

981
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,920
This guy's gotta have a quarter in the back pocket.

982
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,100
Where else can I look?

983
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:53,490
Um...

984
00:59:55,110 --> 01:00:26,110
down this way we didn't really look anything no okay oh wait I should probably stick close to Kenny it's too dangerous out here I just saw I thought I saw someone standing over there oh wait I do I think that's a zombo right there you see oh my head's kind of blocking it I think that's a zombo right there there's something very classic Resident Evil 2 about this entire you know I'm really liking it.

985
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:28,970
Yeah, it's cool.

986
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:30,150
G-VAN!

987
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,190
Oh, good.

988
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:34,670
We can bash the newspaper.

989
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:40,370
A quarter.

990
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:42,890
Let's go.

991
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,470
Silent Hill with all the fog.

992
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,470
New Silent Hill soon.

993
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:53,830
I saw some people getting early access to it.

994
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:58,010
And I'm avoiding I'm like, oh my gosh, I have to avoid everything.

995
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,070
I have to avoid watching them play.

996
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:01,410
I'm so excited, though.

997
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,110
Fuck!

998
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:03,590
What?

999
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,250
What's up with the boat?

1000
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,010
It ain't gonna work.

1001
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:11,050
Holes cracked beneath the waterline, plus someone stripped out the battery.

1002
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:11,730
Uh-huh.

1003
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:12,770
You can't fix it?

1004
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,410
Oh, the battery?

1005
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:15,390
Where are you gonna...

1006
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:16,390
What are you gonna do with the battery?

1007
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,430
What the hell is that?

1008
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,190
A fate worse than death.

1009
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,370
That's so messed up.

1010
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:31,820
Okay.

1011
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,620
We got this building.

1012
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:36,500
How do we know?

1013
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,220
You took one glance at it.

1014
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,380
No sign of any boats down there.

1015
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,640
Watch there be one single boat.

1016
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,020
But it's going to belong to someone.

1017
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:46,820
Plenty of ducks.

1018
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:47,980
No boats.

1019
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,900
There wouldn't be a...

1020
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,820
Just a boat.

1021
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,400
Oh, I guess the sunken boat.

1022
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,060
Up river.

1023
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,720
What if we looked over and there's Kenny?

1024
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:02,560
Oh.

1025
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:03,560
What the hell?

1026
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,560
Wait, what am I seeing?

1027
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,800
Oh my gosh, Spider-Man.

1028
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,180
Oh my god.

1029
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,520
Get down.

1030
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,240
Get down.

1031
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,660
I didn't get to observe everything, but that's okay.

1032
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,700
Why the hell are we hiding?

1033
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,740
Someone came down from that building at the end of the street.

1034
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:32,660
Where'd he go?

1035
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,260
So I'm running to that news.

1036
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,800
Yeah, he's right there.

1037
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,220
Could be our bell ringer.

1038
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:38,860
How about we go find out?

1039
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,080
Ambush.

1040
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,140
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

1041
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,000
Sounds like a plan.

1042
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:43,700
Let's go do it.

1043
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,620
Okay, you head up the middle of the street.

1044
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:46,380
I'll go around the side.

1045
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,280
He's kind of got a weapon, though, but we have a gun.

1046
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,360
Come up on him quiet.

1047
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,660
Take him by surprise.

1048
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:51,800
All right, let's go.

1049
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:52,940
Yeah.

1050
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,580
We just want to talk to this guy.

1051
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:56,040
Yeah, yeah.

1052
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,240
Oh, we're going to talk.

1053
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,780
Oh, I'm going to talk.

1054
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:02,840
Okay, what's the plan?

1055
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:03,440
What are we doing?

1056
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,160
Sneaking mission?

1057
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:08,990
Sneaking mission?

1058
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:14,810
Hello?

1059
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,970
Trying to get some magazines?

1060
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:22,830
Oh, nobody's here.

1061
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:25,590
Oh, how'd he do that?

1062
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:27,130
Oh, it's a kid.

1063
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,270
Oh, ow!

1064
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:29,770
Oops.

1065
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:31,990
I was too slow.

1066
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:38,560
Hey!

1067
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:39,640
No!

1068
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:40,840
Him!

1069
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:43,410
Clem?

1070
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:45,310
Please, don't hurt him.

1071
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:46,570
A girl?

1072
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,040
Can't, uh, I don't know.

1073
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:53,610
Hello.

1074
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:56,850
Well, not a kid.

1075
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,850
It looked so small.

1076
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,570
You're not from Crawford.

1077
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:07,190
Gasp.

1078
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:09,930
Uh, you're not the guy on the radio?

1079
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:10,390
Crawford?

1080
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:11,110
Crawford?

1081
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:13,070
What the hell are you talking about?

1082
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:13,950
Alire.

1083
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:16,570
Kenny, Kenny, put the gun down.

1084
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,550
Kenny, put the gun down.

1085
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:19,130
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, don't.

1086
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,210
Kenny, don't.

1087
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,530
Oh my god.

1088
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:27,370
No, he's with us.

1089
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:29,590
Oh my god.

1090
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:30,950
Yeah, but he's kind of stupid.

1091
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,350
We apologize for his...

1092
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:35,030
Kenny, Kenny, we said no.

1093
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:41,030
Who the hell are you people?

1094
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:42,230
We're just coming.

1095
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,490
Everyone calm down.

1096
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:45,750
Everyone just calm down.

1097
01:04:45,990 --> 01:05:18,090
down once she tells me who the fuck she is the name's Molly Molly I'm Lee this is Kenny and Clementine we're not looking for any trouble yeah hi hi she's so cute you guys really aren't from Crawford are you what is Crawford I don't even know what that is everything beyond that barricade oh what the hell happened here oh I Are they like the crazy like...

1098
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:18,830
Are you sure you want to know?

1099
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:21,690
They created like some crazy faction.

1100
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:27,310
When everything started going to shit, some people got together and sealed off that whole neighborhood.

1101
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:30,210
Folks willing to do anything to stay alive.

1102
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:31,610
Stop the dead getting in.

1103
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:33,270
I try to avoid them.

1104
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:34,570
Why?

1105
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:41,750
Let's just say they have a zero tolerance policy for anyone who won't or can't live by their rules.

1106
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,430
So how'd you know we weren't them?

1107
01:05:45,990 --> 01:06:18,710
the smell because there are no children in crawford not anymore well who's been ringing the bells who's been ringing those bells all over town yeah yeah that would be me oh i knew it lee i knew she was the one who's been following us fucking with us hey get that finger out of my face kenny chill before i jam it straight up your ass i haven't been following you i don't even know who the hell you people are calm down kenny the voice on the radio she does look like the one that The first church.

1108
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:22,450
Whoever you are, ringing those bells this morning nearly got us all killed.

1109
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:22,830
Yeah.

1110
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:24,470
Raised the dead all around us.

1111
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,030
That's the idea, genius.

1112
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,310
It's how I get around.

1113
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,530
I ring a bell in one neighborhood to attract the local geeks towards it.

1114
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:32,870
Lies me some time to scavenge the areas they cleared out.

1115
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:34,050
Geeks.

1116
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:35,450
Is that what you call them?

1117
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:35,990
Yeah.

1118
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:39,330
You know, like at the carnival, bellied anything, alive or dead.

1119
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:39,690
What?

1120
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:41,830
I thought...

1121
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:42,170
Wait, what?

1122
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,830
Doesn't take much to outsmart the dead.

1123
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:45,290
A bunch of dumbasses.

1124
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:46,870
You just gotta move fast.

1125
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:47,090
She's so cool.

1126
01:06:47,550 --> 01:07:20,490
before they start to wander back again what's the oh wait why no children no children why not I'm no children no elderly no one with an advanced medical condition basically no one who might be a burden on the community Crawford's all about the survival of the fittest that's how they survive the rest of the world went to shit around but but you're gonna eventually not have survival of the Everyone's gonna get old with no kids.

1127
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:25,210
What exactly did Crawford do with all these burdens?

1128
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:26,970
What happened to them?

1129
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,930
Well, you met some of them already.

1130
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:32,110
Oh my god.

1131
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:33,750
Oh my god!

1132
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:40,330
Yeah, anyone who got sick, anyone too old, anyone they figured wasn't strong enough to survive.

1133
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:42,970
To them, those people were just mouths to feed.

1134
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,050
A drain on their precious resources.

1135
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:45,730
I'd live.

1136
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:51,210
How do you know all this?

1137
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,570
Everyone in Savannah knew.

1138
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:58,130
What was going on inside Crawford got passed around like a ghost story.

1139
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:00,050
Except this one was true.

1140
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:06,390
If I were alive, I mean, I would live.

1141
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:07,250
Probably.

1142
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:10,990
But yeah, I'm a ghost anyway.

1143
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:11,510
I'm going to ask you people again.

1144
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:14,030
You're not from Crawford, so who the hell are you?

1145
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,110
What are you doing here?

1146
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,630
We were trying to get a boat.

1147
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:22,850
I came down here looking for a ball, hoping to get our people out of here and find someplace safe.

1148
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:24,750
Yeah, good luck with that.

1149
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:28,130
Anyone with a boat took it out of here as soon as people started eating each other.

1150
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:30,770
Any of that got left behind, Crawford stripped him for parts.

1151
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:31,750
Hours too.

1152
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,510
There's gotta be something.

1153
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,890
If there was, do you think I'd still be here?

1154
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,890
I've been over every inch of this city.

1155
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:41,230
This whole place is- Yeah, it's funny if they realize kids are important after they get told to have them.

1156
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:41,550
God damn it.

1157
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:42,450
Fuck!

1158
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:43,610
Hey, moron.

1159
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:45,110
You want to keep your voice down?

1160
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:46,770
Caddy, shh!

1161
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,950
Shit.

1162
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:53,690
Since you're not getting on any boat, I'd advise you folks to go back to where you came from before...

1163
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:54,050
No.

1164
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:55,690
Oh, no!

1165
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:56,810
Great!

1166
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:57,810
Just wait.

1167
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:58,550
No!

1168
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:04,070
Oh, I was trying to say who's the girl Spider-Man earlier.

1169
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:04,810
I think it's Gwen.

1170
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:08,150
That's who she reminds me of.

1171
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:10,770
Isn't there another way back to the house?

1172
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:13,010
Molly, is there a...

1173
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:14,750
Molly's out?

1174
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:15,530
Molly...

1175
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:16,550
Molly is part...

1176
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:18,530
Hey!

1177
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:20,010
You're just gonna leave us here?

1178
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:24,630
Sorry, I must have missed that part of our conversation where you became my problem.

1179
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:25,090
Yeah!

1180
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:25,430
Please!

1181
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,910
Yeah, give her the puppy dog eyes.

1182
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:32,150
Please!

1183
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:33,170
Please!

1184
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:33,930
Come on!

1185
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,890
Make it fast!

1186
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:35,630
Okay.

1187
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:38,810
Oh my god.

1188
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,970
They're hobbling over here.

1189
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:42,250
They're so slow!

1190
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,690
Hurry!

1191
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:47,390
There's slow little guys.

1192
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:49,810
Me, come on.

1193
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:51,750
One good jump.

1194
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:52,310
One good jump.

1195
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:52,610
Oh, okay.

1196
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,130
Yeah.

1197
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,230
Oh, it's just like before.

1198
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:57,230
Oh my god, no.

1199
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:58,170
No!

1200
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,070
It's just like before.

1201
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:06,750
I'm gonna push the dumpster, but I'm gonna do it with no sense of urgency.

1202
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:11,470
And we're gonna run.

1203
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,610
Eh, oh.

1204
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:14,350
Oh no!

1205
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:15,530
It's the girl that's...

1206
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:45,970

1208
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:48,550
I thought they would just fall in.

1209
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,320
Oh, they do.

1210
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,700
They do just fall in.

1211
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,160
She really went.

1212
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,780
I missed the part where that's my problem.

1213
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,320
She is Spider-Man!

1214
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,620
Clementine, can you hear me?

1215
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,520
If you can hear me, just get back to the house, okay?

1216
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:11,780
I'll meet you there.

1217
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:13,860
Oh.

1218
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,420
Sewer episode?

1219
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,100
Shit.

1220
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:25,620
They're going back now.

1221
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:31,630
Sewer level.

1222
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:34,130
It's a zombie game, all right.

1223
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:38,710
It's a zombie game, all right.

1224
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:41,830
Wait, uh, uh, uh, this way?

1225
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:42,910
Okay, here we go.

1226
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,960
We gonna get teenage mutant ninja turtles.

1227
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,580
Okay, we have that way.

1228
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,880
All right, that's the way we gotta go.

1229
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:56,520
Oh.

1230
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:58,780
Oh, okay.

1231
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,660
I thought the game froze on me for a second.

1232
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:07,140
Yeah, what happened to the climbing pick?

1233
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,180
We have our gun, but I think that's the only thing we've got.

1234
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,640
Why did he get...

1235
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:14,600
Rats!

1236
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,080
No!

1237
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:17,900
Dead rats!

1238
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,460
Half eaten sewer rats.

1239
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,700
Walkers must be down here too.

1240
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,340
I can pick it up.

1241
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,360
Why would I do that?

1242
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,860
Last thing I need is some god-awful disease.

1243
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,180
Why would I do that?

1244
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,740
Oh, I do have the pick.

1245
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,020
You can see it in my inventory.

1246
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,440
Open the passageway.

1247
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:48,450
I hear...

1248
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:51,290
I hear it.

1249
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:52,330
I hear something.

1250
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:53,410
Close.

1251
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:56,730
It's a drainage pipe.

1252
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,260
There's a sound.

1253
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:02,500
They sound so close.

1254
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,280
Oh, I don't like the angle.

1255
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:19,540
Um, wasn't it the first...

1256
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:38,220
Yeah, wasn't it the first episode of The Walking Dead where they covered themselves in, like, the grossness and, uh, slip through the dead that way?

1257
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:43,510
Oh, what is this?

1258
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,430
What is this gonna do?

1259
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:46,750
What's the park gonna do?

1260
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,950
They did that at some point.

1261
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:51,830
Yeah, right.

1262
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,600
Lentil, welcome back.

1263
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,700
Thank you so much.

1264
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,800
What happens if I do...

1265
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,440
What's...

1266
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,360
What's this park do?

1267
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,740
Looks like some kind of drainage pipe.

1268
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,480
Can we flush them out?

1269
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,020
Turn it left.

1270
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,260
Wait, lefty Lucy.

1271
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,240
Righty tidy.

1272
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,420
Righty.

1273
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:24,550
Oh, oh.

1274
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:25,870
Dang it.

1275
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,770
Good thing I'm out here and not in there.

1276
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:30,950
It seems loose.

1277
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:32,170
Oh!

1278
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:33,510
Shit.

1279
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:36,090
Stop talking to yourself, maybe?

1280
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:47,370
Oh my gosh.

1281
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:48,630
The controls.

1282
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:53,450
Open up.

1283
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,370
Never mind.

1284
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:56,850
Open up.

1285
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,410
Oh, nice.

1286
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:01,170
Okay.

1287
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:04,970
Nice.

1288
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:08,210
Okay.

1289
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,910
Where are we?

1290
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:11,510
Oh, wait.

1291
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:12,710
We just made a little loop.

1292
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:15,050
So then we use it on this.

1293
01:15:15,530 --> 01:15:16,870
But what are they doing over here?

1294
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,490
Oh my gosh.

1295
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:19,890
Oh my gosh.

1296
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:20,290
Oh my gosh.

1297
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:20,770
Oh my gosh.

1298
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:21,890
That was so scary.

1299
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:24,770
It started turning red because the guy was going to notice me.

1300
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,200
Okay.

1301
01:15:36,860 --> 01:16:04,960

1302
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:18,970
Is that all of them?

1303
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:21,510
It is.

1304
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:22,630
Oh, but except her.

1305
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,830
But I guess it's fine.

1306
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,110
Wait, I don't like this part.

1307
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:27,970
It's so scary.

1308
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:29,850
Okay, I'm going.

1309
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:32,430
Chuck!

1310
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:36,250
You must have tried to hide out down here.

1311
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:37,710
Poor bastard.

1312
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:41,010
No bullets.

1313
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,670
You must have saved the last one for yourself.

1314
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:46,050
Oh, Chuck!

1315
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:51,430
Oh, Chuck!

1316
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00,240
I think we can get her.

1317
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,040
Sorry, oh my god, this scared the heck out of me.

1318
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,880
Oh, damn it, damn it, damn it.

1319
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,280
Oh, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

1320
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,560
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1321
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,140
This game is suddenly turning so scary.

1322
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,040
This game is suddenly turning so scary.

1323
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,980
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1324
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:28,120
Okay.

1325
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:29,700
Everything's fine.

1326
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:31,080
Phew.

1327
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,840
I was even too, I was too panicked to even say anything.

1328
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:36,580
Holy moly.

1329
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:38,820
Gosh.

1330
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,460
Those bars are way too solid.

1331
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:42,460
That was so scary.

1332
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:43,420
Okay.

1333
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,600
To the left or to the, anything to the left?

1334
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,480
Nope, it's the wall.

1335
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:46,800
Okay.

1336
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,120
Pick up the broken ladder.

1337
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:50,300
No way I could pick that up on my own.

1338
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,040
Uh, look at the bro.

1339
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:54,120
Looks like somebody saw the damn thing off.

1340
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,700
That's messed up!

1341
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,980
Oh, I see, is that a door right there?

1342
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,720
It did go down to him!

1343
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,120
Jump scare.

1344
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,180
Can I grab it?

1345
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,260
Maybe with the thing?

1346
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:09,760
Be careful.

1347
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:14,200
There's a hole there.

1348
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:14,900
What the hell?

1349
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:18,800
Is this a door?

1350
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,760
I like how we can pick up the door.

1351
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:23,220
Lot.

1352
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,500
Fucking perfect.

1353
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,440
Okay, of course it doesn't work.

1354
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,940
Uh-oh, I think we're heading into Crawford, you guys.

1355
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,340
I think this is gonna go to Crawford.

1356
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,760
I don't think this goes home.

1357
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:48,810
Uh-oh, maybe we should cover it back up.

1358
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:52,650
Fallout shelter.

1359
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:53,910
We're playing Fallout.

1360
01:18:53,930 --> 01:19:20,990

01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,410
Chuck was so close.

I know.

1368
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:39,330
Oh, I didn't think Chuck would...

1369
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:40,230
Well, I don't know.

1370
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:41,010

01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:41,830

Oh, look, he's shaking!

1384
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:16,730
Be more of a mercy than anyone from Crawford ever showed us.

1385
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:18,050
Think, Vernon.

1386
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:20,390
What do you think they'll do if they find out we're down here?

1387
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:21,110
Vernon, don't do it.

1388
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:21,710
Don't do it, Vernon.

1389
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:22,090
Damn it.

01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:22,990
You're right.

I'm sorry.

1392
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:24,970
I'm not from Crawford.

1393
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:26,030
Can't take the risk.

1394
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:29,190
I'm not from Crawford, but I saw what they did up there.

1395
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:30,630
It made me sick.

1396
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:31,550
Yeah, I've tried.

1397
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:32,430
I'm reasoning.

1398
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:33,010
I'm reasoning.

1399
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:34,070
I don't think you are either.

1400
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:35,850
I think you're a good man.

1401
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:37,250
Yeah, Vernon.

1402
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:37,490
Oh.

1403
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,350
Keep back or I swear I'll shoot.

1404
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:44,370
Uh, uh, uh.

1405
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:46,130
I told you he's lying.

1406
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:47,490
He is one of them.

1407
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:48,870
Kill him before he killed us.

1408
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,600
I didn't think he would do it.

1409
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:01,360
I didn't think he, I didn't think he would do it.

1410
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,760
Oh, I have to go through this all over again.

1411
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,100
Uh, I don't want any trouble.

1412
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:13,520
All right.

1413
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:14,680
We'll do the same thing as before.

1414
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,520
I don't want any trouble.

1415
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:17,960
Neither do we.

01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,460
Shoot him in the head Why not?

1419
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:05,080
Be more of a mercy than anyone from Crawford ever showed us Before I'd live What do you think they'll do if they find out we're down here Right under their feet?

1420
01:25:05,200 --> 01:26:17,300

1421
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,440
up and hide from him down here.

1422
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:21,300
This old basement's been abandoned for years.

1423
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,240
They're in provision!

1424
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,220
What is this?

1425
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,060
The morgue?

1426
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:26,620
Yeah.

1427
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:31,040
Irony's always high on my list when I'm looking for a place to survive.

1428
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:31,840
I'm bunk beds.

1429
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,560
How did you find your way down here?

1430
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:36,380
Uh, walkers.

1431
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:38,740
A few of us got boxed in by walkers up on the street.

1432
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,480
Came down here trying to get away.

1433
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,300
I was honest.

1434
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,680
Now I just want to get out of here.

1435
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:44,040
Get back to my own people.

1436
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:44,820

1439
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,660

01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:23,300
Molly?

1441
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:24,560
Hi, Molly.

1442
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,000
Oh, hey.

1443
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:26,920
You made it back.

1444
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:29,000
Who's this?

1445
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:30,140
I don't know.

1446
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,860
He didn't tell you about me?

1447
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:33,680
Understandable, I guess.

1448
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:37,600
I'm the one who put that beating on him when he tried to jump me back at the river.

1449
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,060
Who's the fossil?

1450
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:41,920
Where's Clementine?

1451
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:43,080
Where's Clementine?

1452
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,880
She's around here somewhere.

1453
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:45,920
Relax.

1454
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,940
I got her and Kenny both back safely.

1455
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:49,900
You're welcome, by the way.

1456
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:54,520

You're gonna be all right.

Lee brought a doctor.

1461
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,300
Omead?

1462
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:01,580
All right, let's take a look at it.

1463
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,480
I work better without an audience.

1464
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,660
Why don't you go find your little girl?

1465
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:07,960
He's gonna kill him.

1466
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:17,380
Clementine?

1467
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:18,760
Clementine?

1468
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:21,700
Clementine, it's Clementine.

1469
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:22,720
Where are you?

1470
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:27,420
Clementine, you in here?

1471
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:28,960
Where is she?

1472
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,760
What's in the cabinet?

1473
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,300
Clementine's drawing!

1474
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:37,660
Clem, you in here?

1475
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:41,060
She wouldn't hide from us, would she?

1476
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,100
Minus two.

1477
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:45,880
It was good.

1478
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:46,220
Shut up.

1479
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,860
Clem's drawings.

1480
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,320
Where is she?

1481
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,540
Why does she draw that?

1482
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:07,180
Why?

1483
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:12,680
Oh, gosh.

1484
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,060
We don't need just doctors.

1485
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,260
We need therapists.

1486
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,680
Oh, my gosh.

1487
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:20,540
Bathroom?

1488
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:21,940
Are you in there?

1489
01:31:22,540 --> 01:31:22,940
Oh, me.

1490
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,340
Did we hear by W.D.

1491
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,000
Dennis too.

1492
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,240
I like him too.

1493
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:29,240
Clem?

1494
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:30,880
Where?

1495
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Where is she?

1496
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,080
Oh, the shadow kind of scared me.

1497
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:39,310
Hello?

1498
01:31:40,010 --> 01:31:40,130
Clem?

1499
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:43,050
Clem?

1500
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,450
Oh, who are you?

1501
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:45,010
Oh, Molly.

1502
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:45,710
What are you doing?

1503
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:48,170
Oh, you know, just poking around.

1504
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:49,850
You won't find anything.

1505
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:51,370
We already searched the place.

1506
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,830
You'd be surprised what people miss.

1507
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:55,590
Trust me, I've been doing this for a while.

1508
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:57,170
It's Ben, so I wouldn't blink.

1509
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:57,670
Yeah, I wouldn't.

1510
01:31:57,670 --> 01:31:58,390
Where's Clementine?

1511
01:31:58,750 --> 01:31:59,470
Don't ask me.

1512
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:00,270
I'm not her keeper.

1513
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:03,890
Hey, do I look like I'm in the mood to be jerked around?

1514
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:05,850
Where did she go?

1515
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:11,270
Last I saw she was downstairs with your redneck friend and that college kid who hangs around with him.

1516
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:13,030
Why don't you go bug them?

1517
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:17,390
Why is the music getting so intense?

1518
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,550
I don't care about that.

1519
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:21,450
I just want to find Clementine.

1520
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:22,350
Okay, okay.

1521
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:24,430
Alright, we'll go downstairs.

1522
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:27,870
We'll go.

1523
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:28,730
We'll go.

1524
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:32,260
We'll go.

1525
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:33,480
Oh, this is the bathroom.

1526
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,160
We'll go.

1527
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:39,410
There's an Easter egg here.

1528
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:41,530
Should I go back in?

1529
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:44,670
Wait, let's look through the hallway window real quick.

1530
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:46,370
She's not outside, right?

1531
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:49,330
Don't see her out there.

1532
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:52,110
We're, like, really freaking out, though.

1533
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:56,330
We're, like, really, really freaking out after you.

1534
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:00,980
What else is in here, anyway?

1535
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:04,600
Molly?

1536
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:05,600
Molly!

1537
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,880
I told you, that girl isn't with me.

1538
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,460
Go ask your buddies and quit bothering me.

1539
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:13,600
Stop yelling at me!

1540
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:44,200
maybe in the drawers then Clementine no sign of her in here okay I don't know what the Easter egg is but that's okay you let me instead Molly you guys okay we're not going to go in there we'll go downstairs because that's where she said she was Clementine come out Please!

1541
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:45,240
Are we okay?

1542
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,100
Are we okay?

1543
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:48,220
Kenny?

1544
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,400
Oh, hey, you made it back.

1545
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:54,660
Good job.

1546
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:55,700
Good job.

1547
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,500
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1548
01:33:58,380 --> 01:33:59,480
What does it look like?

1549
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:02,240
Where'd you get the bottle?

1550
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:03,700
It was on the table.

1551
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,600
Found it.

1552
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:07,240
You want to throw down again like back on the train?

1553
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,440
Because I fight better when I'm shit-faced.

1554
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,380
Kenny, come on.

1555
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:10,920
Give me that.

1556
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:11,860
Give me the bottle, Kenny.

1557
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:12,960
Give me the bottle, Kenny.

1558
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,400
Give me the damn bottle.

1559
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:15,140
Give me the bottle, Ken.

1560
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,620
Get the fuck away from me.

1561
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:16,920
Kenny!

1562
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,500
Getting wasted's not going to help anyone.

1563
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:20,600
Yeah?

1564
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:21,840
Well, what is?

1565
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:23,900
We are fucked.

1566
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:29,720
Molly said there's not a single boat left in Savannah.

1567
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:30,280
Yeah?

1568
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:31,260
No way out.

1569
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:33,440
We got walkers all around us.

1570
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,260
That crazy fuck on the radio messing with us.

1571
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,100
Hell, if now ain't the time for a drink?

1572
01:34:42,830 --> 01:34:44,350
But bed's just sitting there.

1573
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:46,710
Ben don't do it.

1574
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,930
Ben, take it from him.

1575
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:49,270
Take it from him, Ben.

1576
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:50,490
Ben, take it from him.

1577
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:51,590
Ben, take it from him.

1578
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:53,690
Where is Clementine?

1579
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:56,910
Have either of you seen Clementine?

1580
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:00,170
Damn to final.

1581
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:02,230
Gotta be around here somewhere.

1582
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:04,830
Ben, how did Clementine sneak out of the house?

1583
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:06,770
Hey, don't put all that on me.

1584
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:09,630
Omid took a turn for the worse, and Krista asked me to help.

1585
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:10,510
I'm sorry.

1586
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:11,890
I'm doing the best I can here.

1587
01:35:12,490 --> 01:35:13,410
You're not doing...

1588
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:14,970
She was frantic, and things got kind of crazy.

1589
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:16,250
That's not good enough.

1590
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:17,370
I told Clementine to stay put.

1591
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:18,770
What else could I do?

1592
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:20,150
That's not good enough.

1593
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:21,570
Whatever.

1594
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,430
Oh!

1595
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,650
Don't give me that whatever shit.

1596
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:24,810
Just tell me where she is.

1597
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:27,590
I think she went out to play in the backyard.

1598
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:28,830
On her own.

1599
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:30,470
With no one watching her?

1600
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:32,730
Man, will you get off my back?

1601
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:33,710
Oh my god.

1602
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:34,350
Oh my god.

1603
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:37,530
You literally said that there's somebody watching us!

1604
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:39,910
And you said that she's fine out there!

1605
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:43,530
Clementine?

1606
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:47,110
Oh my god!

1607
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:48,230
Oh my god!

1608
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:49,030
Oh my god!

1609
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:52,770
She's gotta be in here.

1610
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:53,950
She's in here.

1611
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:55,670
Door's covered in pines.

1612
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:58,510
Don't think anyone came in through there.

1613
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:13,640
Okay.

1614
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:16,840
Everything is still the same there.

1615
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,060
But I'm in a being totally useless challenge if I have voted in this bed.

1616
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,580
She's in the doghouse?

1617
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:27,860
She's not...

1618
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:55,770
in the doghouse oh my god we're gonna find like something of hers on the ground oh my god oh my god oh my god she's in the bushes it's we're done playing weasel come on out did i look at everything out here

1619
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:09,200
oh whoops Don't think anyone came in through there.

1620
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:11,520
Uh...

1621
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,140
Uh...

1622
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:29,930
Oh, what were you doing in there?

1623
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:32,150
What were you doing in there?

1624
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:33,250
Exploring?

1625
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:34,050
And look!

1626
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:35,130
Look what I found!

1627
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:35,830
Yeah?

1628
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,210
How'd you get in there?

1629
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:45,150
What?

1630
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:46,530
Cool.

1631
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:47,630
Oh!

1632
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:50,350
No way!

1633
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:53,690
She found a boat!

1634
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:56,990
Holy shit.

1635
01:37:58,850 --> 01:37:59,070
Swear.

1636
01:37:59,370 --> 01:37:59,810
Oh, sorry.

1637
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:00,650
I should have said, whoa.

1638
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:09,140
You can thank Clementine, the best character.

1639
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,620
Best character, Clementine.

1640
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:16,680
She's... she's... she's gotten us through so much.

1641
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,160
Oh my god!

1642
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,920
But how do we get it to the water?

1643
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,200
Uh-oh, is he alive?

1644
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:28,820
Omid?

1645
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,400
Clem's the real MVP.

1646
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:33,300
She's the goat.

1647
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:35,060
She's the best of all time.

1648
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,220
She's the boat!

1649
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:42,440
One Clementine is worth 2,000 beds.

1650
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,720
Uh, how's Omid doing?

1651
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:45,940
Omid's doing okay?

1652
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,960
As well as can be expected under the circumstances.

1653
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,160
I did what I could for you.

1654
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,900
Minus two that?

1655
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:53,680
That was good!

1656
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:54,420
That was a real infection.

1657
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,520
Without antibiotics, I...

1658
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:59,720
Will you quit pacing?

1659
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,520
You're making everyone nervous.

1660
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:02,960
Why are you even still here?

1661
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:03,520
I'm just walking.

1662
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:08,900
Hey, if your friend really can get that boat working, you're taking me with you as payment for saving your asses.

1663
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,820
I figure that's fair enough, don't you?

1664
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,360
Yes?

1665
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:14,720
Will?

1666
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,060
You want the good news or the bad news?

1667
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:21,620
The bad news.

1668
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,820
Let's get the bad news out of the way first.

1669
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:25,060
The bad news is...

1670
01:39:25,260 --> 01:40:25,120
not taking us anywhere the shape she's in right now gas tanks empty and the battery's dead okay so what's the good news well she works that's it that's all she needs some gas and a battery okay other than that she's good to go gas is hard to get that stuff yeah Crawford sounds like Crawford is the one place that has everything we need uh-oh maybe we should try there such a terrible idea now hold on a minute surely we have to try if there are people left in this city who are still alive who still have supplies what harm can it do to ask trust me you don't know these people they sound insane you showing up with it's like the worst idea ever i just well put a noose around his neck they don't exactly welcome children with open arms i don't know why we couldn't leave to a different city and get gas but i don't see what other choice we have and just how exactly do you figure we do this this is like the worst idea i've heard that place Sneaking mission!

1671
01:40:25,140 --> 01:40:26,860
There might be some way we can sneak in there undetected.

1672
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:29,240
There might actually be a way.

1673
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,340
I know the sewer system that runs beneath Crawford like the back of my hand.

1674
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:33,520
Oh?

1675
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,160
Oh?

1676
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:36,620
Y'all wouldn't happen to have a map by any chance.

1677
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:39,300
Wait, we do actually have a map.

1678
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:41,660
Kenny, have you ever heard of using ores?

1679
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,200
Sneaking mission!

1680
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:47,540
So we can pass under the perimeter and right into the center.

1681
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:48,380
Solid lead.

1682
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:56,620
We come up right underneath them, take them by surprise, grab what we need, Get out before they even knew what hit them.

1683
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,760
That's actually not the worst idea I've ever heard.

1684
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:00,520
I think...

1685
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,540
I mean, it's close, but I don't know.

1686
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:03,360
I don't know.

1687
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,260
Maybe it could work.

1688
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:05,820
I've thought about it before.

1689
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,880
Just never had the people to do it.

1690
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:09,020
But I think...

1691
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:10,660
Vernon, it's not that big of a boat.

1692
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:11,960
Like, everyone is...

1693
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:12,220
Okay.

1694
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:14,080
What do you want in return for all this help?

1695
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,580
I think we sacrifice Ben.

1696
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,620
Barber doesn't just have what you need for your boat.

1697
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,420
They're also well stocked with medical supplies.

1698
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:23,640
Medicine that my people could use, just as yours could.

1699
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:24,400
We can do this.

1700
01:41:24,420 --> 01:42:04,820
we have to sacrifice Ben sacrifice decided then we're going to Crawford anyone else have a problem with this plan because we're gonna need every one of us to pull this off yeah man I don't know oh my god I'd rather take a chance on doing something than just sitting around here waiting to die yeah that boat out there is gonna kill us that's gonna get some Ben's gonna get us a little bit farther are you in or out out out we should tonight under cover of dark tonight i'll go let my people know give you all a chance to prepare i'll be back before midnight be careful that's how i'm still alive

1701
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:28,400
i told you to stay in your room how long have you been there you still don't know the guy on the radio is it going to be dangerous it's what going to be dangerous don't play dumb crawford oh it's like we're going back to raven home for real I can't lie to you,

1702
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:28,600
Clem.

1703
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,880
Yeah, it's going to be dangerous.

1704
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,120
What if her parents are in there?

1705
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:33,820
That'd be crazy.

1706
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:36,160
Make Omi better and get the boat working.

1707
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:38,080
That's why we have to do this.

1708
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:39,580
Do you understand?

1709
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,660
I don't want anyone else to die.

1710
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:49,800
I was about to say no one else, no one has died this episode, but we lost Chuck.

1711
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,140
Neither do I, Clem.

1712
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,500
But sometimes we have to take it.

1713
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:57,720
Trying to sneak around, but the clap of my Georgia Peaches keeps alluring the car.

1714
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:00,220
I should go get ready.

1715
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:01,840
Uh, say what now?

1716
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:04,220
You said you'd need all of us to do this.

1717
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:04,820
She's so cute.

1718
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:06,480
And you said I'm a big help, remember?

1719
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:07,200
Uh-huh.

1720
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:12,040
Molly said Crawford is the only place left in Savannah that still has people.

1721
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:15,000
That means it must be where my mom and dad are, right?

1722
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:21,370
I don't know, it's dangerous.

1723
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:23,110
Where I'm going, it's just too dangerous.

1724
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:24,350
For children, especially.

1725
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:25,370
Yeah, I remember they killed the kids.

1726
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:27,630
You said I'm supposed to always stay close to you.

1727
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:31,770
None of those options were...

1728
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:32,830
Can't I come with you?

1729
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:33,990
None of those options were null.

1730
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:36,410
Take Clem.

1731
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:42,220
Wow, it's a long decision bar.

1732
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:46,340
I don't want her...

1733
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:49,360
I think Omid might die, and then she would be stuck in here with him.

1734
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:49,720
So yeah.

1735
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,140
You can come.

1736
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:55,520
But you have to promise to stay quiet and do exactly what you're told the whole time.

1737
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:56,660
I think Omid might die.

1738
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,260
If we're not fast enough, you know?

1739
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:00,920
Take her.

1740
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,220
So many people are saying take her.

1741
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:05,100
I wasn't influenced by you guys.

1742
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,260
I did my own decision.

1743
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:18,380
Yeah, also she's so small.

1744
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,540
She might be able to spit through tiny little areas that we might need her like before.

1745
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:24,320
Oh, oh, oh.

1746
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,120
Check out what I found in the garage.

1747
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:29,040
She's smart.

1748
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:31,240
She's not like stupid like Duck was.

1749
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:33,040
Might come in handy on this little break-in.

1750
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:34,640
Nice.

1751
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,360
Can I talk to you a minute?

1752
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:38,100
What's up?

1753
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:39,800
I took another look at the boat.

1754
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:41,340
She's a 30-footer.

1755
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:41,840
Uh-oh.

1756
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:56,600
So not everyone's gonna think so we're gonna have a capacity problem Yeah, both that size ain't gonna hold more than five people even with one of them a kid me you Clem Krista Oh me Ben Polly assuming everyone makes it back alive.

1757
01:44:56,940 --> 01:45:01,540
That's still one too many Even if we cut Molly loose before this is over.

1758
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,360
We're gonna have to make a decision.

1759
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:14,420
You're not serious Look, I'm just saying if we want the best chance of Oh, hello Bye, Ben.

1760
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:16,400
Who the hell is this?

1761
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:18,040
This is Bree.

1762
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:19,080
She can help us.

1763
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:20,520
Um.

1764
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:21,740
How?

1765
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:22,460
Help us how.

1766
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:22,980
Yeah, how.

1767
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,720
I was a student at the school where Crawford keeps their supplies.

1768
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:27,160
I know the layout.

1769
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:29,200
With her help, we're in and out faster.

1770
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,000
Anyone have a problem with that?

1771
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:31,500
Okay.

1772
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:32,060
I guess not.

1773
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:33,440
And what are we waiting for?

1774
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:34,380
Let's get moving.

1775
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:35,760
Okay.

1776
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:37,620
All right.

1777
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:39,360
Chill, Kenny.

1778
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:39,880
I know.

1779
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:41,440
The guy, he knows Bert.

1780
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:41,980
Like, we know.

1781
01:45:42,000 --> 01:46:13,300
burning at this point like ready ready whoa freddy are you freddy you're not taking her with us ready freddy not hear anything i said about the kind of place crawford is she can help you take her in there and they find her this little girl's not just excess baggage she's gotten us out of a tight spot more than once yes she has she's coming deal with it you heard the man oh yeah give clem a fake mustache oh wow thank you ben Where did you get that from?

1782
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:21,620
Deal with it.

1783
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:22,460
This should be it.

1784
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:24,500
We're right underneath the center of Crawford.

1785
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,440
The old school should be directly above us.

1786
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:28,660
Okay, people.

1787
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:29,820
This is it.

1788
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,400
Remember the plan.

1789
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:33,060
We're already here.

1790
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,200
This is so scary.

1791
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:35,160
And we stay together.

1792
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:36,780
We find what we need.

1793
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,240
I'm scared.

1794
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,980
Get the hell out before anyone even knows we're there.

1795
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:40,720
Got it?

1796
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:42,820
If anything happens.

1797
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,460
And that part about staying close.

1798
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:45,780
It goes double for you.

1799
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:59,360
sounds like a solid plan can't get a good look above with the cover on oh yeah of course sorry

1800
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:11,100
I'm scared let's go I'm scared ah

1801
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:19,300
where is everybody Honey, there should be guards patrolling.

1802
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,100
Not the guards.

1803
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:21,420
Are you disappointed?

1804
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:23,660
It's just strange as well.

1805
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:25,020
Uh-oh, wait, is there a rat?

1806
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:26,820
Over there by the door.

1807
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:27,340
Oh, okay.

1808
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,260
I thought someone like ratted them out, you know?

1809
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:29,480
Okay.

1810
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,420
Me and Kenny will sneak up, try to take him out quiet.

1811
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:35,260
The rest of you wait for our signal, then follow us over.

1812
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:36,560
Everybody got it?

1813
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:37,040
Okay.

1814
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:38,760
I like that it just saved.

1815
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:39,020
Okay.

1816
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:41,180
No shooting unless there's no other choice.

1817
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:41,500
Okay.

1818
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:44,080
Oh, why did you, why do you have that?

1819
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:48,540
I'm just gonna run at him.

1820
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:56,750
What the fuck?

1821
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:04,060
Why was it?

1822
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:06,440
Wait, what?

1823
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:08,740
Oh no, no, no.

1824
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:09,860
Wait, why?

1825
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:11,600
Zombie guards?

1826
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,980
What the fuck is a walker doing inside here?

1827
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,420
Did they all get gone?

1828
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,600
Get inside, fast!

1829
01:48:23,390 --> 01:48:25,070
Oh my god.

1830
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:27,130
What dummies.

1831
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:31,050
Wait!

1832
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:38,470
So it's been overrun this whole time and everyone's just been afraid of them?

1833
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:40,850
Or are they using the zombies?

1834
01:48:41,150 --> 01:48:43,850
I don't think they would though, not to that extent, right?

1835
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:44,670
Fuck!

1836
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:45,270
Fuck!

1837
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:46,890
Do you think they saw us?

1838
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:48,070
Maybe.

1839
01:48:49,570 --> 01:48:50,750
Uh, no idea.

1840
01:48:51,090 --> 01:48:52,710
Your guess is as good as mine.

1841
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:55,230
Oh, Clem.

1842
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:57,030
Your heads are scared, Clem.

1843
01:48:57,290 --> 01:48:58,270
No, I'm sorry.

1844
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:00,750
What the hell happened here?

1845
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:03,010
I thought this place was supposed to be secure.

1846
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:05,130
What always happens, I guess.

1847
01:49:05,230 --> 01:49:05,810
Principles of Crawford.

1848
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,770
In the end, the dead always win.

1849
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:09,510
Oh, man, we are so screwed.

1850
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:10,090
Shut up, Ben.

1851
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:10,670
Shut up, Ben.

1852
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:11,110
Shut up, Ben.

1853
01:49:12,090 --> 01:49:13,030
Yeah, this is better.

1854
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:15,990
Yeah, he's right.

1855
01:49:16,230 --> 01:49:16,790
Vernon's right.

1856
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:19,750
We can deal with walkers easier than armed guards.

1857
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:20,610
Yes, I agree.

1858
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:21,150
I agree.

1859
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:22,930
So long as we don't let him box us in.

1860
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:24,010
We can still do this.

1861
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:25,310
The plan hasn't changed.

1862
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:26,870
The plan hasn't changed?

1863
01:49:27,090 --> 01:49:29,350
Every time walkers show up, the plan changes.

1864
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:31,870
Do you even have any idea how many of them are out there?

1865
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:32,230
No.

1866
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:33,450
You want to do a head count?

1867
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:36,190
Or do you want to get what we need and get the hell out of here?

1868
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:38,010
Yeah, shut up, Ben.

1869
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:39,810
Come on.

1870
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:40,890
I think I know which way to head.

1871
01:49:41,650 --> 01:49:42,990
Let's just be quiet, okay?

1872
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:45,030
Ben, shut the heck up.

1873
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:45,730
Shut up.

1874
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,650
I got a bad feeling about this.

1875
01:49:47,710 --> 01:49:48,450
Okay, Shaggy.

1876
01:49:48,590 --> 01:49:49,410
Shut up, please.

1877
01:49:49,690 --> 01:49:50,670
You want a Scooby snack?

1878
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:51,790
Will that help you?

1879
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:52,850
God!

1880
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:55,410
I can't stand this guy.

1881
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,440
That doesn't sound good.

1882
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,240
That doesn't sound good.

1883
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:06,640
Don't do it.

1884
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:08,520
Wait, why are we opening this?

1885
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:11,260
Why are we...

1886
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:12,000
We ignore it.

1887
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:12,660
Just keep moving.

1888
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:14,400
Yeah, ignore it, ignore it.

1889
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:19,020
I miss Chuck.

1890
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:26,370
Zoixly, I've got a bad feeling about this.

1891
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:28,570
I think it's bad.

1892
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:29,390
Ben's time.

1893
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:30,390
Looks okay.

1894
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:31,630
Everybody in.

1895
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:32,810
Oh, maybe not everybody.

1896
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:37,670
Maybe we check it out first before we decide that everyone should go inside.

1897
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:42,850
You took one little glance and then decided it would be okay?

1898
01:50:45,070 --> 01:50:46,770
That everyone should go in?

1899
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:58,260
This place is probably filled with so many, too, because it was a school.

1900
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,580
No, Naomi, no Huey, no Ben.

1901
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:06,880
looks like

1902
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:23,660

Use your brain for two seconds!

1911
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:48,680
Hopscotch.

1912
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:52,180
He's doing hopscotch and squats.

1913
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:55,520
Clem is smart.

1914
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:58,280
She is, but she's small!

1915
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,280
Creepy.

1916
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:00,580
Those are kind of creepy.

1917
01:54:00,820 --> 01:54:01,760
Wait, where did we see it?

1918
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:03,240
We saw one in that house.

1919
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:05,200
Might come back for these later.

1920
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,900
Any reading material would be nice once we get on that boat.

1921
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:11,400
I think these are elementary level.

1922
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:14,480
Ben.

1923
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:15,920
You need any help with that?

1924
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:16,920
Thanks.

1925
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:17,620
I got it.

1926
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:20,200
Just once, I'd like to do something useful, you know?

1927
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:21,160
Yes, please.

1928
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:23,800
Yeah, that'd make a nice change.

1929
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:25,460
That'd make a nice change of pace.

1930
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:28,240
Wow, no need to agree with me quite so much.

1931
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,120
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

1932
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:32,920
Well, I'll let you get on with it.

1933
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,260
I hope you remember that, Ben.

1934
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:37,740
No, wait.

1935
01:54:37,800 --> 01:55:09,060
there is something you can help me with something that's been on my mind I could use your opinion okay what is it it's Kenny since I've been helping him work on the boat I've gotten to know him a little better okay good guy you know and it's eating me up knowing what I know I've been thinking about telling him the truth come on this again it's my fault duck and Kacha got killed if I hadn't screwed up back at the motor inn they'd still be alive how am I supposed to just carry something like that around I have to tell him.

1936
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:13,880
I don't have time for this.

1937
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:16,040
I really don't have time for this.

1938
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,480
You don't get it, Lee.

1939
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:20,680
What am I supposed to do whenever he talks about Kacha and Duck?

1940
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:23,220
Just nod and pretend like it wasn't my fault.

1941
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:24,220
I can't do it anymore.

1942
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:25,800
At least he takes the responsibility.

1943
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:28,320
There'll come a time when he's ready to hear it, but it's not now.

1944
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:29,080
It's not now.

1945
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:29,580
Not yet.

1946
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:30,460
It's not now.

1947
01:55:31,780 --> 01:55:32,700
I hear you.

1948
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:34,240
I'm going to get back to this.

1949
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:41,720
Oh.

1950
01:55:47,400 --> 01:56:14,220
quite a system here Crawford's final solution wait what did it say oh initials of oh number of ineligible citizens found number of citizens brought to Crawford number of walkers found I was close initials a person conducting the search days since outbreak oh I didn't notice it said OB ah I was so close I appreciate Ben solving the boat problem himself

1951
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,960
I was so close!

1952
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:20,900
Ineligible citizens.

1953
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,280
That's kind of messed up, though.

1954
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,640
So I did get the initials of the person, right?

1955
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,080
Didn't get the code right.

1956
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:28,460
Like the, or the numbers, right?

1957
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:31,700
Or, like, the 7-1-0-O-B.

1958
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,540
But then number of walkers.

1959
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:36,100
Number of citizens brought.

1960
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:36,560
Ah!

1961
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:40,620
How do I get out of this?

1962
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:41,620
Oh!

1963
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:42,360
My bed.

1964
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:43,360
Oh, there we go.

1965
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:43,640
Okay.

1966
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,280
Look, it's like she's in school.

1967
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,360
You okay, Clem?

1968
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:54,140
This desk is just like the ones we have in my school.

1969
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:57,080
I know it's weird, but I kind of miss it.

1970
01:56:57,580 --> 01:56:58,440
Being in school.

1971
01:56:59,480 --> 01:56:59,880
Nah.

1972
01:57:01,660 --> 01:57:02,880
I miss teaching.

1973
01:57:02,980 --> 01:57:03,440
Me too.

1974
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:05,560
I used to be a teacher, remember?

1975
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:08,520
You got the real-life version correct to be fair?

1976
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:10,740
Set up a little classroom.

1977
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:13,260
Well, in the real-life one, there's only two numbers.

1978
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:14,620
Will there be homework?

1979
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:17,240
No homework.

1980
01:57:19,460 --> 01:57:45,000
do you think things will ever be normal again just like the way they were before remember what cat said what she said i don't know sweet pea what she said but we all have to believe they will remember what cat just said back on the farm speed up she said we'll all be home soon and now she's dead but we're not we're still alive and we have to keep her alive too

1981
01:57:50,460 --> 01:58:11,160
dang oh there's more paste eat it just a bunch of paste more like a bunch of snacks what's going on in the rest of the world i i actually don't know what's going on like i don't remember i don't think i ever got far enough in the walking done to know what happens in the rest of the world

1982
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:19,800
Nothing but crayons and construction paper.

1983
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:24,880
Isn't there like a spin-off series of...

1984
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:25,740
Uh, what's his name?

1985
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:26,660
So according to...

1986
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:27,240
Norman Reedus?

1987
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:28,520
He was at the maintenance shed.

1988
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:30,220
Medicine might be at the nurse's office.

1989
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:31,220
He's pretty much a therapist at this point.

1990
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:34,300
The battery would probably be at the auto shop out through here.

1991
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:36,500
Okay.

1992
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:37,420
Where do I go?

1993
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,500
Fire escape, nurse's office, door to the plate.

1994
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:42,360
We are where?

1995
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:44,800
I guess it's fine.

1996
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:47,300
Daryl, yeah, yeah.

1997
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:48,760
Yeah, there was like a...

1998
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:50,840
He was like, he like goes to France or something, no?

1999
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:54,800
Hey, where'd Molly go?

2000
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,440
Principles of Crawford.

2001
01:58:56,980 --> 01:59:00,380
All illnesses and medical conditions must be disclosed to the...

2002
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:00,900
Council.

2003
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:05,140
Children under 14, not admitted without authorization.

2004
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:08,460
Anyone asked to leave Crawford cannot return under any circumstances.

2005
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:12,860
Theft or looting within the district will not be tolerated.

2006
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:14,040
Waste not.

2007
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:16,120
Make the most of your rations.

2008
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:19,260
Minto eating dog treats and paste.

2009
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:22,080
I'm starting to understand why you're a ghost.

2010
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:25,600
Oh, the leader.

2011
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:27,040
Must be the guy who ran this place.

2012
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:31,060
Looks like he figured himself as some kind of supreme leader.

2013
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:33,440
I thought it was a wanted sign.

2014
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:46,580
Oh, there she is.

2015
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:50,100
The alleyway to the auto shops down here.

2016
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:51,420
You coming or not?

2017
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:52,260
Holy moly.

2018
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:53,700
Okay, ma'am, please.

2019
01:59:57,180 --> 01:59:57,940
Shell casings.

2020
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,120
Wait, what am I climbing?

2021
02:00:02,460 --> 02:00:03,940
I've already been fired.

2022
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:05,020
They're worthless.

2023
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,640
Okay, we saw these earlier.

2024
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:11,080
She went this way, right?

2025
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:14,840
Exit to the alley.

2026
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:16,200
Okay, I think this is her.

2027
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:19,380
So loud.

2028
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:20,440
I know, Molly, please.

2029
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:21,260
Yell louder.

2030
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:24,400
This must be the door to the alleyway.

2031
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:25,960
It's not going to go off, right?

2032
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:26,620
Like, the long way.

2033
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:28,000
Where the hell is Molly?

2034
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,400
Yeah, where did Molly go?

2035
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,680
Why did she leave us?

2036
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:36,420
Molly, you out here?

2037
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:38,500
She has a weapon.

2038
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:39,380
She has a weapon.

2039
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:43,120
Guess I'm not going that way.

2040
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:44,700
Molly!

2041
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,400
Looters will be shot on sight.

2042
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,080
I thought I heard something.

2043
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:00,220
I do hear something.

2044
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:00,700
I do hear something.

2045
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:02,720
I do hear something.

2046
02:01:02,980 --> 02:01:03,380
Oh, gosh.

2047
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:06,040
Molly.

2048
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:15,780
I'm scared.

2049
02:01:25,590 --> 02:01:25,790
Wait.

2050
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:26,530
Hold on.

2051
02:01:26,810 --> 02:01:27,550
Trying to look at this.

2052
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:30,090
Looters will be shot.

2053
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,270
I said, okay.

2054
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:36,080
Anything in here?

2055
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:39,000
A TV.

2056
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:44,520
We're very slowly making our way out.

2057
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:48,200
idea required?

2058
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:49,440
Beyond this point?

2059
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:51,140
Who has a photo idea on them?

2060
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:53,700
Well, climbing the fence isn't an option.

2061
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:55,840
Look up at the shed?

2062
02:02:01,630 --> 02:02:02,230
It won't let me.

2063
02:02:06,250 --> 02:02:07,830
Actually, I'm kind of...

2064
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:08,730
Oh, inside.

2065
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:09,290
Oh, okay.

2066
02:02:15,690 --> 02:02:16,490
Ah, thank you.

2067
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:21,760
Are these stable?

2068
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:26,280
I guess...

2069
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:26,480
Wait.

2070
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:56,920

What the?

2074
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:26,780
Why is it looking?

2075
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:27,780
Leave him!

2076
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:29,400
Don't yell.

2077
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:30,280
He's mine.

2078
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:31,300
Wait, what?

2079
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:32,580
He looks like a...

2080
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:32,880
What?

2081
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:33,500
What?

2082
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:34,480
Where have you been?

2083
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:35,920
Where the hell have you been?

2084
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:39,660
She's got a vendetta against somebody.

2085
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:44,540
He looks like a vampire.

2086
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:45,800
Molly?

2087
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:48,400
Molly!

2088
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:49,780
What?

2089
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:53,320
Uh, I think you got it.

2090
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:54,640
I think you got it.

2091
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:57,200
one more

2092
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:09,600
he's wearing medical scrubs some kind of scientist or doctor maybe yeah well he ain't shit new yeah

2093
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:18,780
did you find us a way in yeah but the garage door is jammed can't raise it

2094
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:56,230
not a problem so she's just been been like oh yeah that'll work running around like spider-man oh I wonder if it's because someone was shouting oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh come on they'll get stuck on the barbed wire surely

2095
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:11,170
No, he's gonna crawl in.

2096
02:05:12,050 --> 02:05:13,230
He's twitching out there.

2097
02:05:13,370 --> 02:05:14,530
He's twitching out there.

2098
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:18,250
Take a look around.

2099
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:20,530
I'll make sure no stragglers get under this door.

2100
02:05:20,950 --> 02:05:21,430
Okay.

2101
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:24,030
And if there's somebody in here?

2102
02:05:28,610 --> 02:05:29,090
Okay.

2103
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:32,810
Looks like it's the hose for the lift hydraulics.

2104
02:05:33,550 --> 02:05:35,110
Okay, lift panel.

2105
02:05:36,190 --> 02:05:37,790
Oh, there's probably the battery in there.

2106
02:05:38,950 --> 02:05:41,550
Okay, we're probably going to have to lower the car, right?

2107
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:43,250
More of Crawford's rules.

2108
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:45,450
How did anybody get like this?

2109
02:05:45,710 --> 02:05:47,990
Some kind of walk in there.

2110
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:56,800
Can I open this?

2111
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,680
Wow, they got a big truck.

2112
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:01,640
Does this work?

2113
02:06:03,580 --> 02:06:04,000
What?

2114
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:06,200
Well, I can see where the battery is.

2115
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:32,620

2117
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:08,460
So yeah, fuck them.

2118
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:09,240
You know what?

2119
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,700
I felt that.

2120
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,640
Think I can borrow that hook thing of yours?

2121
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:16,500
I don't know.

2122
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:17,920
Hilda and I have been through a lot together.

2123
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:19,300
They were like killing other people.

2124
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:21,020
That's what I call her.

2125
02:07:21,340 --> 02:07:21,840
Don't judge.

2126
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:22,340
Hilda.

2127
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:23,420
Please, can I borrow Hilda?

2128
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:25,000
I'll take good care of her.

2129
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:26,660
She won't get a scratch.

2130
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:29,340
Thank you for Hilda.

2131
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:31,160
I got your promise now.

2132
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:32,340
Not a scratch.

2133
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:35,700
It sounds like a death flag for Hilda.

2134
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:38,240
Uh-oh.

2135
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:43,560
That blinking must be an anti-theft system.

2136
02:07:43,640 --> 02:07:44,400
Wait, which means...

2137
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,480
The chance of a working battery being in that car.

2138
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:48,360
Yeah, but it might sound an alarm.

2139
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:50,520
How...

2140
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:52,240
How...

2141
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:53,160
What's the word?

2142
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:54,800
Left for dead.

2143
02:07:56,500 --> 02:07:58,040
I can't reach it up there.

2144
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:00,220
Okay, let's do the hydraulic.

2145
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:01,940
Oh, wait.

2146
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:02,820
Let's look at the pan.

2147
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:03,440
Wait, can I...

2148
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:06,700
Do the panel that controls the hydraulic lift over there.

2149
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,740
Alarm without battery.

2150
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:09,640
No, it has a battery.

2151
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:10,400
That's what we're saying.

2152
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:13,080
No power.

2153
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:13,640
Okay.

2154
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:15,200
Then we gotta cut it.

2155
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:16,520
We gotta cut the hose.

2156
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:19,800
It's a little leak.

2157
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:21,240
Just a small, small leak.

2158
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:24,460
There we go.

2159
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:25,020
I did it.

2160
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:25,520
Uh-oh.

2161
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:26,580
Why is the music bad?

2162
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:27,700
Whoa, whoa.

2163
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:31,720
That's probably not good.

2164
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:32,360
No, shit.

2165
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:37,660
Oh, oh, grab the battery.

2166
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,540
Finally something goes right.

2167
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:41,340
This is right.

2168
02:08:42,660 --> 02:08:43,900
This is right to you.

2169
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:51,880
Oh my god.

2170
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:52,480
Oh my god.

2171
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:53,700
Take it, take it, take it, take it.

2172
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:54,180
Please.

2173
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:55,100
Got that one off.

2174
02:08:55,380 --> 02:08:56,420
Okay, got that one off.

2175
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:57,560
It's off.

2176
02:08:58,280 --> 02:08:59,420
Oh, we got a lot of time.

2177
02:08:59,520 --> 02:08:59,780
Ish.

2178
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:01,320
Got it.

2179
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:03,200
Wow, but we still got a problem here.

2180
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:04,500
Put it in here.

2181
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:05,200
I'll carry it.

2182
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:09,440
Okay, now we know for sure the battery works.

2183
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:10,780
Yeah?

2184
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:12,980
Move your ass!

2185
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,020
I'm moving my ass!

2186
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:17,700
She's telling me to twerk.

2187
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:23,820
Okay, why?

2188
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:25,200
Why did we go here?

2189
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:27,900
Skylight.

2190
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:29,400
Okay.

2191
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:31,920
It's shut!

2192
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:33,160
Shoot it out!

2193
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:33,800
Okay!

2194
02:09:41,610 --> 02:09:43,950
Is she gonna be able to get us?

2195
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:45,110
Okay.

2196
02:09:46,890 --> 02:09:48,610
Oh my gosh, so much better than Kenny.

2197
02:09:52,010 --> 02:09:54,190
Okay, so now we're on a roof.

2198
02:09:54,570 --> 02:09:54,690
Yeah.

2199
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:56,130
Do you ever stop complaining?

2200
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:56,810
I know, right?

2201
02:09:57,170 --> 02:09:57,690
Wait a second.

2202
02:09:58,010 --> 02:10:03,090
This is so much better than being down there, I'd say.

2203
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:05,790
Wait, how are we supposed to make that?

2204
02:10:05,850 --> 02:10:07,190
Come on, what are you, chicken?

2205
02:10:07,670 --> 02:10:08,070

Thanks, but I think we're almost in.

We're taking care of it, Lee.

2211
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:25,700
Don't worry.

2212
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:28,400
Telltale made a Back to the Future game.

2213
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:29,660
They did!

2214
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:32,260
No way!

2215
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:34,300
That's fun.

2216
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:38,840
What else we got going on in here?

2217
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:40,260
This is to the out.

2218
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:41,020
This is where we went.

2219
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:41,960
Okay, this is where we, sorry.

2220
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:42,520
I forgot.

2221
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:44,100
A little lost.

2222
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:47,900
Okay, let's go back to the classroom and check on Clem.

2223
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:50,980
Little help.

2224
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,420
Little help here.

2225
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:53,420
What's happening?

2226
02:11:53,820 --> 02:11:54,860
Oh my god.

2227
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:55,560
Oh my god.

2228
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:58,420
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

2229
02:11:58,480 --> 02:11:58,680
E!

2230
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:00,560
Fuck.

2231
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:02,300
The doors won't close on the bike.

2232
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:03,480
I wonder why.

2233
02:12:04,420 --> 02:12:06,860
I need something.

2234
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:08,720
There we go.

2235
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:10,420
Break the door with something.

2236
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:10,920
Something.

2237
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:12,080
Grab the hatchet.

2238
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:21,500

Thanks for all your help back there.

2242
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:19,860
You're welcome.

2243
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:21,680
I don't think we would have made it without you.

2244
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:22,620
No problem.

2245
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:24,880
We're all on the same team.

2246
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:29,580
So we're just going to go into her trauma.

2247
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:31,060
So you're a cancer survivor.

2248
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:32,540
Like Vernon and the others.

2249
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:33,280
Yeah.

2250
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:35,340
I was diagnosed when I was in college.

2251
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:37,220
Been getting treatment ever since.

2252
02:13:38,020 --> 02:13:44,400
Just when I was starting to get better, when I thought there might be some hope, all this happened.

2253
02:13:44,500 --> 02:13:45,100
Oh, no.

2254
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:46,620
Lost my whole family.

2255
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:47,300
No.

2256
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:48,200
I'm the only one.

2257
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:49,120
He's the one who survived.

2258
02:13:49,820 --> 02:13:51,240
Funny how things work out at home.

2259
02:13:51,320 --> 02:13:53,100
Wait, so she is not completely better?

2260
02:13:54,660 --> 02:13:55,860
That's so sad.

2261
02:13:58,600 --> 02:13:59,860
How long have you known Vernon?

2262
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:01,020
A couple of years.

2263
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:02,360
He ran our support group.

2264
02:14:02,700 --> 02:14:05,680
He was really great helping me come to terms with my disease.

2265
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:08,500
But how do you come to terms with something like this?

2266
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:10,380
With a place like Crawford.

2267
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:14,140
I don't know what I or the other survivors would have done without Vernon.

2268
02:14:14,360 --> 02:14:14,700
Oh.

2269
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:15,740
He's the one who held us together.

2270
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:16,000
Oh, no.

2271
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:16,980
Vernon's going to die.

2272
02:14:18,220 --> 02:14:48,980
a death flag for Vernon oh no Vernon's not gonna make it what do you think about this whole I'd rather not talk about it too many awful memories even being back here gives me a bad feeling even now with everyone dead I got no sympathy for what happened to these people they weeded out the sick and the old even children those least able to defend themselves so that they could save their own skins whatever happened here however Crawford fell I consider it poetic justice Damn,

2273
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:50,200
girl, that's cool.

2274
02:14:50,780 --> 02:14:51,520
It's how I feel.

2275
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:55,380
If you'd seen what I've seen, you'd feel the same.

2276
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:00,800
We know that they killed children and old people and everything.

2277
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,160
Maybe you should go get that battery or help with the medicine.

2278
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:06,740
We know that they were killing people.

2279
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:07,780
Clem!

2280
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:10,080
You okay, Clem?

2281
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:11,660
Yeah.

2282
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:14,000
Where's Molly?

2283
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:15,820
I don't know.

2284
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:41,280
I hope she's okay yeah i hope so too she'll be fine she's pretty tough yeah she's cool i like molly just sit tight okay i hope she lives go take care of a few things all right so there's like a joke on tick tock that i think is kind of funny it's like if somebody like watches a video and they like like the video or like the person they'll be like you're so funny i hope you don't go bald

2285
02:15:45,060 --> 02:16:12,900
I almost said it and being like I hope she doesn't die I almost said I hope she doesn't go bald I don't know why it started I just think it's kind of what do we still need we already got the fuel in the but if you are bald bald is beautiful good to go so where's this battery you found Molly has it I said so three times well she'd better bring it back here I don't know why you She saved your life,

2286
02:16:12,940 --> 02:16:13,520
didn't she?

2287
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:16,920
Yeah, but what has she done for me lately?

2288
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:18,920
What have you done?

2289
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:19,760
Huh?

2290
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:21,380
Wait, oh, did I just...

2291
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:22,160
Is it the same combo?

2292
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:23,760
How are you guys doing with that door?

2293
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,400
Okay, it's the same thing.

2294
02:16:24,660 --> 02:16:25,580
Slower than I'd like.

2295
02:16:26,080 --> 02:16:27,300
Don't worry, we'll get it open.

2296
02:16:27,900 --> 02:16:30,100
I think it depends on how short you cut her hair.

2297
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:31,860
She'll go bald.

2298
02:16:32,580 --> 02:16:34,520
Minto, you're so funny, I hope you don't go bald.

2299
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:35,640
That would, like, never happen.

2300
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,500
It's literally impossible.

2301
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:40,960
I would never go bald.

2302
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,380
Can I

2303
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:50,060
leave?

2304
02:16:55,230 --> 02:16:56,050
This way.

2305
02:16:56,770 --> 02:16:58,590
Okay, Molly, it's time to come back now.

2306
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:05,080
Molly, it's time to come home.

2307
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:08,860
I forgot about them.

2308
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,440
I can just leave?

2309
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:15,120
Oh my gosh.

2310
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:17,380
We're just gonna walk past there.

2311
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:22,780
Molly?

2312
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:27,600
Shit.

2313
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:34,020
Kristen Vernon must be trapped in there.

2314
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:35,680
Uh-oh.

2315
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:37,000
Wait.

2316
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:38,520
Um.

2317
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:41,940
Do I shoot?

2318
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:46,820
They're all gonna come at me.

2319
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:50,520
Where did they come from?

2320
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:03,820
I don't know.

2321
02:18:07,710 --> 02:18:08,690
Look up?

2322
02:18:11,630 --> 02:18:12,370
What do you mean?

2323
02:18:12,490 --> 02:18:12,990
Look up!

2324
02:18:14,050 --> 02:18:15,010
There's nothing up!

2325
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:19,780
What do you mean up?

2326
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:25,620
Down.

2327
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:27,520
Look down?

2328
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:29,440
There's nothing up.

2329
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:33,760
The speaker?

2330
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:35,120
You think we can get it?

2331
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:37,080
But it's not like lit up.

2332
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:38,760
I'll try.

2333
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:41,540
It won't let me shoot it.

2334
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:42,560
I have to shoot one of them.

2335
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:47,820
I'll take down this big guy.

2336
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:50,560
Oh, okay.

2337
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:52,320
I was like, oh, they didn't notice at all.

2338
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:53,380
Oh, my God.

2339
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:54,030
Oh, my God.

2340
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:59,080
Oh, kind of fast.

2341
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:05,400
You guys okay in here?

2342
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:08,300
This is me?

2343
02:19:11,240 --> 02:19:12,720
What the hell happened?

2344
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:13,980
Yeah.

2345
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:46,880
after we got inside i think they must have heard us rooting around in here the whole place is infested they're everywhere calm down we're trying to leave what about your bald head like a crystal ball oh it's bald take a look looks like they were keeping all the prescription meds in that safe locked up tight uh can we bust it open we can bust it open maybe with enough time I don't know how much of that we have.

2346
02:19:47,660 --> 02:19:51,020
It'd be a hell of a lot quicker if we just knew the four-digit combination.

2347
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:54,260
Well, I doubt they just wrote it down and left it here for us to find.

2348
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:56,060
We should just try busting it open.

2349
02:19:56,220 --> 02:19:57,920
The streamer excels at all.

2350
02:19:58,040 --> 02:19:59,560
Okay, you get started.

2351
02:19:59,940 --> 02:20:02,420
I'll take a look around, see if I can find anything useful.

2352
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:04,060
Like a combination.

2353
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:07,040
I'll have to take time to rest later, I think.

2354
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:09,660
But I'm sleepy now.

2355
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:12,740
Just a bunch of papers.

2356
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:14,540
No safe combination, though.

2357
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:17,860
I know it.

2358
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:18,640
I know it.

2359
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:20,060
I know it.

2360
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:22,680
Eight zero zero eight.

2361
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:26,040
Looks like some kind of medical file.

2362
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:26,880
I know it.

2363
02:20:26,980 --> 02:20:27,560
I know it.

2364
02:20:27,780 --> 02:20:29,180
Eight zero zero eight.

2365
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:32,380
Oh, wait.

2366
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:33,320
We can watch them.

2367
02:20:33,660 --> 02:20:34,100
Oh, dang.

2368
02:20:34,180 --> 02:20:35,880
I was going to say we can watch them unlock it.

2369
02:20:36,140 --> 02:20:36,340
Wait.

2370
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:39,060
Why is there a camcorder at the bed?

2371
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:41,540
What's this on the floor?

2372
02:20:41,740 --> 02:20:42,260
The baby?

2373
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:43,820
It's a sonogram.

2374
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:47,740
Is that for a baby?

2375
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:50,640
Just dried blood on this printout.

2376
02:20:51,220 --> 02:20:52,380
Headed on the floor.

2377
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:54,540
Looks like a trail of it.

2378
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:55,200
Oh, I'm scared.

2379
02:20:55,540 --> 02:20:56,820
I saved to the camera over there.

2380
02:20:57,540 --> 02:20:58,220
Then out the door.

2381
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:00,780
What the hell happened here?

2382
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:03,040
Is that for the baby?

2383
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:04,900
Is that for a baby?

2384
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:07,420
Does the sonogram show you the baby?

2385
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:09,200
Y'all already checked these drawers?

2386
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:10,360
Yes, Lee.

2387
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:12,080
Nothing in there worth taking.

2388
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:15,100
Okay, you don't need to be so patronizing.

2389
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:47,640
organizing there's a first aid kit right here already cleaned out just kidding too short it must be eight zero zero eight one three five yeah yeah yeah what what were they recording i'm not gonna shoot it i think that's dangerous hey krista yeah about clementine i hope i did the right thing bring a clementine with us.

2390
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:48,320
I think she's fine.

2391
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:50,040
This place isn't exactly safe.

2392
02:21:50,460 --> 02:21:51,160
Then why did you?

2393
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:54,240
Because leaving her alone with Omeid didn't seem any safer.

2394
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:55,840
What's that supposed to mean?

2395
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:59,120
No offense, Krista, but Omeid's pretty sick.

2396
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:03,080
If he dies with Clementine alone in the house with him, that is not going to happen.

2397
02:22:03,380 --> 02:22:03,960
Do you hear me?

2398
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:05,940
That is not going to happen.

2399
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:09,280
We're going to get these meds to Omeid, and he's going to be fine.

2400
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:10,780
He's going to be fine.

2401
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:11,680
You're right.

2402
02:22:11,860 --> 02:22:12,380
I'm sorry.

2403
02:22:14,680 --> 02:22:15,680
Are you feeling okay?

2404
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:16,500
Are you feeling okay?

2405
02:22:16,860 --> 02:23:30,820
Why do we a timer why are you asking me that it's just that you've been looking a little pale the past couple of days you've been throwing up come on you just dug up a rotting dog car she's a baby she's has the baby lee i'm fine she has baby okay worry about oh mead we've got to get him these meds are you making any progress with the safe she has baby without the combination i don't know how we're going to get this damn thing open if we don't get back to omid with okay we'll figure it out oh my god look lee i just want to get back to omid let me do my thing all right okay okay me and lee say the same thing sometimes wait open the camcorder yeah no tape inside okay just kidding i think we tried that before okay we can talk to vernon oh wait uh how's it coming slow too slow i'm worried by the time we managed to get this thing open it may be too late about molly molly helped me get the battery we needed that's great one down where is she i don't know she took off had some kind of errand

2406
02:23:30,820 --> 02:23:43,060
she needed to run took off who has errands in the apocalypse yeah don't worry get free i hope so that girl doesn't really strike me as a team player more than mercenary kind

2407
02:23:47,380 --> 02:24:17,820
you want my medical opinion as soon as we'd get him some strong antibiotics to start fighting that infection the better let's just leave it at that huh yeah thank you for coming with us I just wanted to thank you for coming she went to get milk for all your help I really appreciate it from that farm we were at it's times like these we've got to help each other the most right and we're no better than those Crawford's sons of bitches yeah I heard that I'll go see if I can find something that'll help us get that safe open.

2408
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:18,800
Good idea.

2409
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:22,080
Where can I find a copier?

2410
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:23,360
Oh, maybe the copier has something.

2411
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:24,260
What is this?

2412
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:25,520
A copy machine.

2413
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:28,180
Not that it matters with no power around here.

2414
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:29,800
But it might have something in it.

2415
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:30,500
Okay.

2416
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:31,620
We don't check.

2417
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:32,880
We don't check those things.

2418
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:38,360
Uh, I think I looked at everything.

2419
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:41,940
Looks pretty sturdy.

2420
02:24:42,660 --> 02:24:44,220
No way we're gonna force that open.

2421
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:49,460
We might be able to find something 8-0-0-8.

2422
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:50,580
Omi needs that medicine.

2423
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:52,480
We have to get it open now.

2424
02:24:53,020 --> 02:24:53,780
Okay, okay.

2425
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:55,040
I'm gonna go check out Zot.

2426
02:24:55,100 --> 02:24:56,000
I'm gonna go work.

2427
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:57,520
It might not be in here.

2428
02:24:57,800 --> 02:25:02,680
Because also there was like the combination to the locker, right?

2429
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:05,400
So...

2430
02:25:05,400 --> 02:25:07,560
Copy machine their butts probably.

2431
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:13,140
Okay, we're looking for a safe combination.

2432
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:14,900
Oh, the zombie...

2433
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:17,140
Well, they are still here.

2434
02:25:17,260 --> 02:25:19,260
Oh, I thought the zombie bodies disappeared.

2435
02:25:22,340 --> 02:25:24,500
Anything in the vending machine.

2436
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:31,340
Can we look at the bloody locker again?

2437
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:37,820
Uh...

2438
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:39,640
Any other lockers?

2439
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:41,400
Wait, maybe this has something.

2440
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:45,340
Must be the guy who ran this place.

2441
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:46,360
Uh...

2442
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:47,440
Looks like he figured himself...

2443
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:48,580
There's a file on the desk.

2444
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:49,940
Yeah, but it...

2445
02:25:50,060 --> 02:25:51,660
I clicked on it.

2446
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:55,440
No, I don't think that has anything.

2447
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:00,920
Check the file.

2448
02:26:01,220 --> 02:26:02,440
Oh, did I miss it?

2449
02:26:07,930 --> 02:26:08,550
I don't know.

2450
02:26:08,630 --> 02:26:10,590
I didn't actually see if it gave me a second option.

2451
02:26:10,750 --> 02:26:11,510
I'll go check again.

2452
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:17,400
I think...

2453
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:18,880
Oh, oh, I can pick it up.

2454
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:21,040
Oh!

2455
02:26:21,180 --> 02:26:22,060
Anna Correa.

2456
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:24,680
Guess she must have been a patient here.

2457
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:26,680
And what's this?

2458
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:28,040
Are they making...

2459
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:30,680
Sorry.

2460
02:26:38,990 --> 02:26:39,710
Zombie babies.

2461
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:43,330
Sorry.

2462
02:26:46,610 --> 02:26:47,590
No taping, sir.

2463
02:26:47,730 --> 02:26:48,530
No, I have a tape now.

2464
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:49,110
I have a tape.

2465
02:26:49,610 --> 02:26:50,070
Oh, there it is.

2466
02:26:50,110 --> 02:26:50,570
Tape, tape, tape.

2467
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:57,770
Vernon, Krista, come look at this.

2468
02:26:57,950 --> 02:26:58,810
They're doing experiments.

2469
02:26:58,970 --> 02:27:00,710
This is day 82 since the outbreak.

2470
02:27:02,470 --> 02:27:05,650
Dr. Logan in consultation with patient Anna Correa.

2471
02:27:06,410 --> 02:27:07,370
How do they keep this charged?

2472
02:27:07,490 --> 02:27:09,970
Oh, I guess I did have, like, batteries and fuel and stuff.

2473
02:27:10,810 --> 02:27:11,210
Regulations.

2474
02:27:11,650 --> 02:27:16,070
Oberson has ordered me to keep records of all medical examinations and consultations.

2475
02:27:16,650 --> 02:27:17,630
Is that the guy she killed?

2476
02:27:17,650 --> 02:27:18,550
You brace yourself, Anna.

2477
02:27:18,850 --> 02:27:20,650
The sonogram confirms that you're pregnant.

2478
02:27:22,670 --> 02:27:24,550
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

2479
02:27:26,110 --> 02:27:28,110
As you know, the rules are very clear.

2480
02:27:28,470 --> 02:27:29,990
The termination is mandatory.

2481
02:27:30,650 --> 02:27:31,690
You don't have to tell them.

2482
02:27:32,470 --> 02:28:04,770
just nausea but you gave me something for it and it went away this is my problem not yours if oberson finds out that i concealed evidence of a pregnancy i'm sorry but these are the rules i'm going to give you a sedative it'll make the procedure easier on you i don't want the procedure i want my baby is this like molly's sister or something and they killed her you don't have a choice now if you like you can take some time with this but i need you to come back no later I have no choice but to inform overs on myself.

2483
02:28:04,790 --> 02:28:05,950
I'm trying to get the baby out.

2484
02:28:06,250 --> 02:28:06,950
Killed her or something.

2485
02:28:07,070 --> 02:28:08,450
Oh, she left.

2486
02:28:17,610 --> 02:28:18,310
Damn it.

2487
02:28:18,410 --> 02:28:19,590
We almost had it.

2488
02:28:19,990 --> 02:28:22,130
What the hell kind of place was this?

2489
02:28:22,470 --> 02:28:24,850
Like Molly said, the worst kind.

2490
02:28:25,230 --> 02:28:27,010
Lee, maybe there's another tape.

2491
02:28:27,370 --> 02:28:28,270
We gotta keep looking.

2492
02:28:28,730 --> 02:28:30,370
I think I recognize that doctor.

2493
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:33,610
He was one of the walkers out in the alley by the auto shop.

2494
02:28:33,730 --> 02:28:33,990
Yeah.

2495
02:28:34,090 --> 02:28:35,370
Maybe you should search it.

2496
02:28:35,550 --> 02:28:36,450
See what he's got on it.

2497
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:38,810
But that alleyway is like compromised now, no?

2498
02:28:40,570 --> 02:28:55,470
wait it says right there 82 oh i guess that was like the oh it said 82 ob so 82 days after the outbreak they did say that too oh my gosh wait but that that area is compromised no

2499
02:28:59,510 --> 02:29:13,930
bleh bleh bleh bleh won't you blood i hear more guys i hear more guys Surely, if Molly were around, she'd be able to help us.

2500
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:27,240
Dana, thank you!

2501
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:29,900
Yeah, the Nosferatu looking guy.

2502
02:29:30,140 --> 02:29:31,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2503
02:29:32,300 --> 02:29:33,420
We have to go back up again?

2504
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:33,680
Oh?

2505
02:29:34,180 --> 02:29:35,260
Oh yeah, there we go.

2506
02:29:35,900 --> 02:29:36,160
Ah!

2507
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:37,140
Oh my gosh!

2508
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:38,820
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

2509
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:39,920
Where did you come from?

2510
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:48,060
Oh, the TV saved me!

2511
02:29:51,190 --> 02:29:53,270
Oh, that scared me so bad.

2512
02:29:58,830 --> 02:30:00,170
Wait, he's gone?

2513
02:30:01,230 --> 02:30:02,110
Oh, no, he's there.

2514
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:08,440
How do we get back?

2515
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:11,400
I'm going to stomp him.

2516
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:19,420
Good thing their heads are so squishy.

2517
02:30:21,520 --> 02:30:22,540
You know?

2518
02:30:23,740 --> 02:30:25,460
This is definitely the guy.

2519
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:26,840
Ah, Nosferato.

2520
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:35,100
Like we can just stomp them so easily like a like a tomato.

2521
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:38,740
This might be just what we need.

2522
02:30:39,220 --> 02:30:39,920
What's this?

2523
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:43,440
Oh, we got the code to Logan's locker.

2524
02:30:45,940 --> 02:30:46,600
Uh-oh.

2525
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:49,040
Time to go.

2526
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:50,500
Time to go.

2527
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:52,620
Lee!

2528
02:30:53,240 --> 02:30:53,560
Stop.

2529
02:30:54,260 --> 02:30:55,960
Get your own lines, Lee.

2530
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:56,480
Come on.

2531
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:05,500
all right let's use let's open the bloody locker

2532
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:26,680
so embarrassing one of us has to change oh safe combination is gotta be on one of these okay nice all right well maybe now i think one of them will show molly

2533
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:58,920
i found two more tapes one of them is dated October 10th that's the day after the first one we watched put it in saving why did the game save have you made a decision I thought you said I didn't have a choice well technically you do you can terminate the pregnancy or leave Crawford of course that would be a death sentence for both you have your own child.

2534
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,840
Maybe that's best.

2535
02:32:01,300 --> 02:32:03,400
I stayed up all last night thinking about this.

2536
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:09,740
Why are we even trying to survive, to keep on living, if this is what it takes, if this is what it's turned us into?

2537
02:32:10,420 --> 02:32:11,640
I don't make the rules, Anna.

2538
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:15,680
Doctor, I'm begging you, please help me.

2539
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:18,700
Maybe one day, when things are different, you can try again.

2540
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:21,440
But for now, today, we have to do this.

2541
02:32:22,600 --> 02:32:22,860
Oh.

2542
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:24,980
Zoom?

2543
02:32:25,420 --> 02:32:25,900
Enhance?

2544
02:32:34,300 --> 02:32:43,860
is he the cause of it all that would be awesome is he the cause she's the reason crawford went to oh

2545
02:32:47,820 --> 02:32:55,320
still had time to turn off the camera though i think we know what happened to crawford more importantly we got the combination

2546
02:33:05,260 --> 02:33:09,900
Looks like the sick system these bastards cooked up to protect themselves wound up destroying them.

2547
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:10,100
Yeah.

2548
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:12,600
Can't say I'll shed too many tears over it.

2549
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:15,740
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

2550
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:18,600
Oh, I should look at this like that.

2551
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:24,400
Antibiotics, morphine, we'll take as much of this as we can carry.

2552
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:24,760
Yahoo!

2553
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:26,840
Okay, I think we're good.

2554
02:33:27,380 --> 02:33:29,920
This is more than enough for your people and mine.

2555
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:31,040
Let's go.

2556
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:31,360
Yay!

2557
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:33,180
You know, I found a third tape in the locker outside.

2558
02:33:33,260 --> 02:33:33,640
Oh, yeah.

2559
02:33:34,400 --> 02:34:01,640
else on there we got the meds from me that's all i care about we'll head back to the classroom don't take too long lee it's gonna show molly it's gonna show molly no one else will know but me about molly i'm gonna know about molly i'm gonna know what is it this was 76 days right so It was like a week or...

2560
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:05,600
It was time!

2561
02:34:05,620 --> 02:34:08,620
As fun as this was, I have to put a stop to this little arrangement.

2562
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:10,500
This is the last I can give you.

2563
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:14,460
Oberson had someone down here yesterday taking inventory.

2564
02:34:14,680 --> 02:34:15,980
He's really cracking down.

2565
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:17,160
I just can't risk it.

2566
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:18,340
We had a deal.

2567
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:20,240
Yes, we had a deal.

2568
02:34:20,420 --> 02:34:21,320
We don't anymore.

2569
02:34:21,900 --> 02:34:24,020
My sister needs this medicine.

2570
02:34:24,300 --> 02:34:28,640
Without it, she'll die or she'll start showing symptoms and they'll take her away.

2571
02:34:29,540 --> 02:34:54,400
can't let that happen i'm sorry molly i've done all i can but i have to look out for myself here yeah that's the crawford way isn't it why do you do that right in front of the camera right well well well well well

2572
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:07,720
Let's head back, I suppose.

2573
02:35:07,980 --> 02:35:08,880
It'll help the door.

2574
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:15,000
Wait, I don't hear them banging on the door anymore.

2575
02:35:16,320 --> 02:35:17,800
Oh, my gosh, you scared me.

2576
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:19,800
Where the fuck have you been?

2577
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:20,820
Sightseeing.

2578
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:23,820
I'll take that battery now.

2579
02:35:24,060 --> 02:35:25,260
Oh, yeah.

2580
02:35:26,260 --> 02:35:27,100
About that.

2581
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:28,040
Molly?

2582
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:29,600
Molly.

2583
02:35:31,100 --> 02:35:31,600
I'm sorry.

2584
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:32,460
I'm just kidding.

2585
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:33,200
Oh, okay.

2586
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:38,960
Here you go.

2587
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:40,020
She's just Josh.

2588
02:35:40,300 --> 02:35:41,260
Dang, that thing is huge.

2589
02:35:41,400 --> 02:35:43,560
You were carrying that in your backpack this whole time.

2590
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,040
Where did I put it?

2591
02:35:46,300 --> 02:35:47,320
In my back pocket?

2592
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:47,760
What's that?

2593
02:35:48,660 --> 02:35:49,040
Nothing.

2594
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:51,600
Got a picture of her sister.

2595
02:35:52,860 --> 02:35:53,640
I know you're from Crawford.

2596
02:35:53,660 --> 02:35:54,540
You can quit with the act, Molly.

2597
02:35:55,140 --> 02:35:56,180
I know you're from Crawford.

2598
02:35:56,420 --> 02:35:56,660
What?

2599
02:35:57,100 --> 02:35:57,920
Who told you that?

2600
02:35:58,140 --> 02:35:59,720
I saw you on a security tape.

2601
02:36:00,220 --> 02:36:01,160
Why'd you lie to me?

2602
02:36:01,620 --> 02:36:03,660
I said there were stories about Crawford.

2603
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:05,860
I never said that's how I knew about it.

2604
02:36:06,300 --> 02:36:07,220
I never lied to you.

2605
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:08,020
Lied by omission.

2606
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:09,580
I don't owe you anything.

2607
02:36:09,860 --> 02:36:12,200
You saved my life twice, but you can't tell me the truth.

2608
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:12,700
Yeah.

2609
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:14,280
Are we really gonna do this now?

2610
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:15,100
You know what?

2611
02:36:15,220 --> 02:36:16,200
I guess that's up to you.

2612
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:19,120
I used to live here with my sister.

2613
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,220
She was 14 years old.

2614
02:36:21,400 --> 02:36:21,840
14?

2615
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:26,280
When the dead started walking and Crawford shut itself in, it seemed like a pretty good deal.

2616
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:27,240
She didn't look 14.

2617
02:36:27,720 --> 02:36:28,460
We were safe.

2618
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:30,640
We had everything we needed to survive.

2619
02:36:31,620 --> 02:36:33,700
Then the rules started coming down.

2620
02:36:34,540 --> 02:36:37,560
No one who couldn't justify their place or in their keep.

2621
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:39,820
No one who required special care.

2622
02:36:39,860 --> 02:36:41,120
I thought she was like...

2623
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:42,600
This is so bad.

2624
02:36:42,680 --> 02:36:44,460
I thought she was like their 30s.

2625
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:46,520
Oh, is it different, girl?

2626
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:47,620
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2627
02:36:47,740 --> 02:36:50,060
Kept her safe for as long as I could.

2628
02:36:50,500 --> 02:36:53,120
But in the end, I couldn't protect her.

2629
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:54,900
That's when I got out.

2630
02:36:55,460 --> 02:36:58,680
Crawford, they always talked about how their system worked.

2631
02:36:58,860 --> 02:37:01,340
How anything was better than becoming one of them.

2632
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:35,260
but i saw what they'd already become i just wish i could have seen different person okay okay before they came and took my sister away oh this is all i have left of her oh i didn't have time to take it before i got out of crawford i just wanted it okay it's okay money i understand she's pretty what the hell oh no i think that's our cue to get the hell out of here I think so.

2633
02:37:37,860 --> 02:37:38,860
I don't care.

2634
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:41,660
We could, I kind of want to play where, uh-oh.

2635
02:37:42,660 --> 02:37:44,240
Where Lee is just an asshole.

2636
02:37:46,100 --> 02:37:49,580
Where he's bully Maguire and he says, I miss the part where that's my problem.

2637
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:50,380
Every time.

2638
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:52,840
What?

2639
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:53,920
Ben!

2640
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:55,540
Sorry, sorry.

2641
02:37:55,880 --> 02:37:57,000
I just got spooked by those bells.

2642
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:57,320
Where's Clementine?

2643
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:58,720
And then I heard someone coming.

2644
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:00,400
Did you leave Clementine alone?

2645
02:38:00,980 --> 02:38:02,040
No, Kenny's with her.

2646
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:02,460
Okay, good.

2647
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:04,000
We still can't open that armory door.

2648
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:06,460
He sent me out to look for something we can use to bust it open.

2649
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:07,680
I found this.

2650
02:38:08,440 --> 02:38:09,900
That was for the door.

2651
02:38:10,780 --> 02:38:11,580
Where did you get that?

2652
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:12,040
Oh my god.

2653
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:12,680
I just found it.

2654
02:38:12,800 --> 02:38:13,120
Oh my god.

2655
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:15,920
It was stuck in the door handle at the end of the hallway back there.

2656
02:38:17,500 --> 02:38:17,860
Shit!

2657
02:38:29,770 --> 02:38:30,130
Lee!

2658
02:38:30,570 --> 02:38:31,690
Shoot this fucker!

2659
02:38:31,810 --> 02:38:32,370
Oh my god.

2660
02:38:33,070 --> 02:38:33,770
Wait, who got her?

2661
02:38:34,010 --> 02:38:34,370
Thanks.

2662
02:38:34,630 --> 02:38:35,990
I did not do that.

2663
02:38:36,490 --> 02:38:37,330
It wasn't me.

2664
02:38:37,730 --> 02:38:38,730
I'm going, kid.

2665
02:38:38,810 --> 02:38:39,410
This is fine.

2666
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:40,110
Thanks.

2667
02:38:41,770 --> 02:38:42,310
Clementine

2668
02:38:46,570 --> 02:38:53,790
What the fuck is going on they're coming oh shit that ought to hold them sir But now how do we get out?

2669
02:38:53,950 --> 02:38:54,390
I'm speechless.

2670
02:38:55,270 --> 02:38:56,930
We could just get this damn door open.

2671
02:38:57,190 --> 02:38:59,010
I'm speechless Come on damn you.

2672
02:38:59,010 --> 02:39:06,590
I am speechless Oh my god if you see this is my fault all my fault.

2673
02:39:06,810 --> 02:39:08,310
What the hell's he babbling about Ben?

2674
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:09,550
We talked about this.

2675
02:39:09,850 --> 02:39:11,850
No Wait, I want to know what he meant.

2676
02:39:12,150 --> 02:39:12,690
What do you mean?

2677
02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:13,770
This is all you're calling.

2678
02:39:14,330 --> 02:39:15,530
Penny, I'm so sorry.

2679
02:39:15,790 --> 02:39:16,150
Oh!

2680
02:39:16,150 --> 02:39:17,130
I'm so sorry, Nan.

2681
02:39:17,370 --> 02:39:18,830
Kid, you saved the best time.

2682
02:39:19,130 --> 02:39:20,890
Whatever you did, save it for later.

2683
02:39:21,050 --> 02:39:22,790
Then, shut the fuck up.

2684
02:39:22,870 --> 02:39:23,030
Yes.

2685
02:39:23,230 --> 02:39:23,570
Fuck you, Lee.

2686
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:24,870
I can't do this anymore.

2687
02:39:25,350 --> 02:39:28,270
It's been me all along, putting all of us in danger.

2688
02:39:28,530 --> 02:39:30,470
Kacha and Duck, it was all me.

2689
02:39:30,630 --> 02:39:31,890
It was all me.

2690
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:34,110
This is not the time.

2691
02:39:34,910 --> 02:39:35,670
Wait a minute.

2692
02:39:36,150 --> 02:39:37,150
What are you saying?

2693
02:39:37,350 --> 02:39:37,790
Oh, God.

2694
02:39:37,790 --> 02:39:40,230
It was me who made the deal with the bandits at the motor inn.

2695
02:39:40,310 --> 02:39:41,630
Slipping them supplies.

2696
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:43,710
I thought maybe I could keep them off our backs.

2697
02:39:44,250 --> 02:39:47,850
When it got discovered, that's when they attacked and that's when duck

2698
02:39:52,670 --> 02:39:57,030
Let him at him let him at kick his ass later I agree with you.

2699
02:39:57,030 --> 02:40:01,890
You should kick his ass, but now's not the time Focus on getting out of here.

2700
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:04,050
You little piss ant you're fucking dead.

2701
02:40:04,150 --> 02:40:06,970
You hear me dad my wife and child

Right now.

2704
02:40:13,690 --> 02:40:14,410

2817
02:47:13,290 --> 02:47:16,970
Okay, with a little luck, you should start feeling better pretty soon.

2818
02:47:17,050 --> 02:47:19,030
Oh, Mia's just taking a nap up in here.

2819
02:47:19,050 --> 02:47:20,410
I'll stay here for a few more hours to check on him.

2820
02:47:20,910 --> 02:47:21,630
Let me know if you need it.

2821
02:47:21,630 --> 02:47:23,030

02:47:23,050 --> 02:47:23,670
Thanks, Doc.

2823
02:47:24,390 --> 02:47:24,790
Yes.

2824
02:47:24,950 --> 02:47:26,270
Thank you so much.

2825
02:47:26,370 --> 02:47:35,970
I need some water soon Maybe now's a good time for you and me To have a little talk In private Okay What are we talking about?

2826
02:47:36,310 --> 02:47:36,530
Hello?

2827
02:47:37,610 --> 02:47:48,690
I'm sorry about Bree Listen, man About what happened to Bree Her name makes me hungry for cheese What do you mean by that?

2828
02:47:48,770 --> 02:47:50,650
You don't think by now I got you figured?

2829
02:47:51,270 --> 02:47:55,970
You don't strike me as someone Who has a lot of consideration for others What?

2830
02:47:56,370 --> 02:47:59,290
You did to get me to come here with you in the first place.

2831
02:47:59,530 --> 02:48:03,330
You expect me to believe you give a shit that it wound up costing Brie her life?

2832
02:48:03,530 --> 02:48:05,170
Now just hold on a damn minute.

2833
02:48:05,430 --> 02:48:05,530
Listen.

2834
02:48:05,730 --> 02:48:06,330
No, you listen.

2835
02:48:06,870 --> 02:48:10,150
You got some good people here and they look to you as their leader.

2836
02:48:10,850 --> 02:48:13,270
Well, I'm here to tell you the kind of leader you are.

2837
02:48:14,090 --> 02:48:15,490
They're not going to make it much better.

2838
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:20,150
And you're kidding yourself if you think putting them all on a boat is going to solve anything.

2839
02:48:20,290 --> 02:48:22,110
Wait, why is he saying all this all of a sudden?

2840
02:48:22,970 --> 02:48:25,070
But I know you care about that little girl.

2841
02:48:26,850 --> 02:48:28,410
I'm gonna make you an offer.

2842
02:48:30,130 --> 02:48:30,630
Does he want...

2843
02:48:30,630 --> 02:48:31,790
What kind of an offer?

2844
02:48:31,870 --> 02:48:33,010
Is he wanting to take Clem?

2845
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:36,590
I'll take her off your hands.

2846
02:48:36,870 --> 02:48:36,930
No.

2847
02:48:37,070 --> 02:48:38,990
Take her back with me, to my people.

2848
02:48:39,570 --> 02:48:43,070
We're well supplied, well hidden, and a lot of us have had kids of our own.

2849
02:48:43,070 --> 02:48:43,950
Do you remember the lie?

2850
02:48:44,010 --> 02:48:46,730
And now Crawford's fallen, we got nothing left to fear.

2851
02:48:46,770 --> 02:48:48,230
About her being my daughter?

2852
02:48:48,530 --> 02:48:49,770
She'll be safe with us.

2853
02:48:50,110 --> 02:48:52,770
Safer than she will be if she stays with you.

2854
02:48:53,030 --> 02:48:53,830
I promise you.

2855
02:48:54,050 --> 02:48:55,970
That's what you want for her, isn't it?

2856
02:48:56,370 --> 02:49:30,930
safe i'm gonna pretend you didn't say any of this and give you a chance to walk away but you are you told burning off i know you think you're doing what's best for her and if you were her real father we wouldn't be having this conversation but you're not are you just another one of your lives that little girl's in my care we've been through more together than you can imagine anyone who tries to get between me and her anyone it's gonna wind up dead do you hear me take your hands off me

2857
02:49:34,360 --> 02:49:41,480

2860
02:50:42,690 --> 02:50:43,090
She's...

2861
02:50:43,090 --> 02:50:44,410
Tell the others for me.

2862
02:50:44,650 --> 02:50:46,290
She's handled herself real well.

2863
02:50:46,370 --> 02:50:47,510
You take care of yourself, Molly.

2864
02:50:48,330 --> 02:50:49,070
You too, Lee.

2865
02:50:50,310 --> 02:50:53,250
But yeah, they're gonna run out of food in that sewer eventually.

2866
02:50:56,070 --> 02:50:56,510
And...

2867
02:50:56,510 --> 02:50:57,170
And...

2868
02:50:57,170 --> 02:50:59,250
And you be sure to take care of that little girl.

2869
02:50:59,630 --> 02:51:01,250
You know she thinks the world of you.

2870
02:51:01,570 --> 02:51:02,870
Like, they have no other plan.

2871
02:51:02,970 --> 02:51:04,470
They would just...

2872
02:51:04,470 --> 02:51:04,950
Good luck.

2873
02:51:05,630 --> 02:51:06,850
Ain't nothing to do with luck.

2874
02:51:08,750 --> 02:51:09,370
Bye, Gwen.

2875
02:51:10,310 --> 02:51:11,130
Bye, Molly!

2876
02:51:12,090 --> 02:51:13,290
She was so good.

2877
02:51:15,410 --> 02:51:17,610
Can I have your climbing pick?

2878
02:51:20,790 --> 02:51:22,090
Hey, sweet pea.

2879
02:51:22,850 --> 02:51:24,210
Kenny's working on the boat.

2880
02:51:25,050 --> 02:51:25,390
I know.

2881
02:51:26,590 --> 02:51:29,170
What are we going to do after he fixes it?

2882
02:51:29,770 --> 02:51:30,670
Where will we go?

2883
02:51:33,570 --> 02:51:34,630
Someplace else.

2884
02:51:34,910 --> 02:51:35,810
Someplace else.

2885
02:51:36,750 --> 02:51:37,550
Someplace better.

2886
02:51:37,750 --> 02:51:38,290
Clem, honey.

2887
02:51:38,750 --> 02:51:39,690
Oh, her parents.

2888
02:51:39,690 --> 02:51:40,770
He's been going to be okay.

2889
02:51:41,190 --> 02:51:43,590
Oh, he doesn't seem the same since he got back.

2890
02:51:46,770 --> 02:51:48,010
It's his own fault.

2891
02:51:48,210 --> 02:51:49,750
He's just feeling down right now.

2892
02:51:50,430 --> 02:51:51,910
Truth is, he brought this on himself.

2893
02:51:52,330 --> 02:51:53,210
What do you mean?

2894
02:51:53,650 --> 02:51:55,270
Look, Ben's a good kid.

2895
02:51:55,470 --> 02:51:56,070
He means well.

2896
02:51:56,570 --> 02:51:57,530
He keeps trying to help.

2897
02:51:58,230 --> 02:52:02,530
But every time he does, he winds up putting the rest of us in even more of a jam.

2898
02:52:03,050 --> 02:52:04,310
What happened to Kaja and Duck?

2899
02:52:04,790 --> 02:52:06,570
He feels like he was responsible for that.

2900
02:52:07,150 --> 02:52:08,730
And the fact is...

2901
02:52:08,750 --> 02:52:09,310
He's right.

2902
02:52:09,890 --> 02:52:10,550
He was.

2903
02:52:11,090 --> 02:52:12,830
But he still saved him.

2904
02:52:13,290 --> 02:52:15,270
Yeah, I still saved him.

2905
02:52:15,810 --> 02:52:19,290
Before we leave tomorrow, will we have time to look for my parents?

2906
02:52:22,510 --> 02:52:23,250
Yes, Lot.

2907
02:52:23,470 --> 02:52:26,110
I'd like to, Clem, but I don't think we'll have time.

2908
02:52:26,690 --> 02:52:28,390
We really shouldn't stay here any longer.

2909
02:52:28,570 --> 02:52:29,230
It's not safe.

2910
02:52:29,490 --> 02:52:31,930
Wait, who was the person on the radio?

2911
02:52:32,870 --> 02:52:33,350
Oh.

2912
02:52:37,370 --> 02:52:37,850
Oh.

2913
02:52:39,970 --> 02:52:40,490
We?

2914
02:52:41,230 --> 02:52:42,650
We are gonna reach out, right?

2915
02:52:42,910 --> 02:52:43,170
Oh.

2916
02:52:44,450 --> 02:52:44,730
Oh.

2917
02:52:45,390 --> 02:52:45,390
Oh.

2918
02:52:47,870 --> 02:52:48,390
No.

2919
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:52,660
Oh.

2920
02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:53,360
Why didn't you?

2921
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:54,380
Why didn't you?

2922
02:52:54,580 --> 02:52:55,060
Why didn't you?

2923
02:52:55,320 --> 02:52:55,700
Come on.

2924
02:52:56,200 --> 02:52:57,500
You want to be a father to her.

2925
02:52:57,680 --> 02:52:58,260
Be a father.

2926
02:53:05,800 --> 02:53:07,420
Why is he just sitting there like that?

2927
02:53:19,480 --> 02:53:20,000
Clementine?

2928
02:53:20,740 --> 02:53:21,220
Oh, no.

2929
02:53:25,450 --> 02:53:25,750
No.

2930
02:53:25,950 --> 02:53:26,470
Clementine?

2931
02:53:26,830 --> 02:53:27,330
Oh, no.

2932
02:53:30,660 --> 02:53:31,860
Oh no.

2933
02:53:47,410 --> 02:53:47,730
Hello?

2934
02:53:48,770 --> 02:53:48,970
Oh!

2935
02:53:51,070 --> 02:53:53,190
Chapter 7, Episode 4.

2936
02:53:53,490 --> 02:53:53,930
Clementine?

2937
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:56,150
Is she actually gone now?

2938
02:53:57,730 --> 02:53:58,890

2942
02:54:03,090 --> 02:54:03,650

02:54:10,340 --> 02:54:10,420

02:56:37,820 --> 02:56:38,380

02:56:41,640 --> 02:56:43,060
I appreciate it.

2971
02:56:48,010 --> 02:56:48,530
Kenny.

2972
02:56:50,290 --> 02:56:52,170
You've always been there for me, Lee.

2973
02:56:52,690 --> 02:56:54,290
Always had my back when it mattered.

2974
02:56:54,770 --> 02:56:58,630
What kind of friend would I be if I wasn't there for you now?

2975
02:56:59,450 --> 02:57:01,470
Mitten or not, I'm with you to the end.

2976
02:57:01,850 --> 02:57:03,130
You can count on me.

2977
02:57:04,410 --> 02:57:05,410
What about you, Ben?

2978
02:57:06,090 --> 02:57:07,010
Now hold on a minute.

2979
02:57:07,350 --> 02:57:09,550
You're not really thinking about bringing him with us, are you?

2980
02:57:13,170 --> 02:57:14,250
I need Kenny.

2981
02:57:14,550 --> 02:57:14,730
Wait.

2982
02:57:15,170 --> 02:57:17,230
Ben, I'm sorry, but I need Kenny on this.

2983
02:57:17,930 --> 02:57:19,150
Maybe you should stay with the boat.

2984
02:57:19,450 --> 02:57:20,250
He chose that to work.

2985
02:57:20,270 --> 02:57:21,370
Okay, sure.

2986
02:57:21,690 --> 02:57:23,890
Just don't fucking lay a finger on it.

2987
02:57:23,970 --> 02:57:24,350
You here?

2988
02:57:25,530 --> 02:57:26,350
Okay, guys.

2989
02:57:26,370 --> 02:57:27,550
We should go find Vernon.

2990
02:57:27,870 --> 02:57:28,610
See if he took her.

2991
02:57:28,810 --> 02:57:29,470
Extra meat shield.

2992
02:57:29,710 --> 02:57:30,490
Maybe I should have brought him.

2993
02:57:30,870 --> 02:57:32,810
Are we okay just leaving the boat like this?

2994
02:57:33,190 --> 02:57:34,770
With only Ben to look after it?

2995
02:57:35,270 --> 02:57:36,290
What choice do we have?

2996
02:57:36,890 --> 02:57:41,310
If anything has happened to that boat when I get back, I will fucking bury you in that backyard.

2997
02:57:41,990 --> 02:57:42,590
Are we clear?

2998
02:57:43,530 --> 02:57:44,350
It was.

2999
02:57:44,770 --> 02:57:46,010
He's like, mm-hmm.

3000
02:57:51,140 --> 02:57:52,020
Only Ben.

3001
02:57:52,080 --> 02:57:53,080
Nobody trusts Ben.

3002
02:57:54,020 --> 02:57:57,000
Oh, me and Krista just met Ben, and they already don't trust him.

3003
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:05,460
Oh, wait, are they gone?

3004
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:06,800
No way.

3005
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:09,640
No way did they leave?

3006
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:11,760
There's no food in there.

3007
02:58:11,960 --> 02:58:12,620
They left!

3008
02:58:21,810 --> 02:58:22,690
Everything's gone!

3009
02:58:30,960 --> 02:58:32,220
Where the hell are they?

3010
02:58:33,560 --> 02:58:34,920
Oh my god.

3011
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:37,580
Looks like they got out of here in a hurry.

3012
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:41,140
Vernon, get out here!

3013
02:58:41,780 --> 02:58:43,560
There doesn't have to be any trouble here.

3014
02:58:43,960 --> 02:58:45,180
All I want is the girl.

3015
02:58:45,860 --> 02:58:47,980
Give her back and nobody needs to get hurt.

3016
02:58:55,400 --> 02:58:56,640
They just dipped?

3017
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:07,540
Now is the time for me.

3018
02:59:07,660 --> 02:59:08,300
Is that what that says?

3019
02:59:14,790 --> 02:59:15,110
What?

3020
02:59:17,590 --> 02:59:19,750
Oh my god, he saw the horde.

3021
02:59:21,050 --> 02:59:22,290
Did not tell them.

3022
02:59:22,770 --> 02:59:24,190
And then they all left.

3023
02:59:27,670 --> 02:59:28,270
Wow!

3024
02:59:32,780 --> 02:59:34,180
Wow, he saw it.

3025
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,160
Clementine, are you all right?

3026
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:43,180
Where are you?

3027
02:59:45,560 --> 02:59:46,980
Vernon, you son of a bitch.

3028
02:59:48,300 --> 02:59:49,240
Hello, Lee.

3029
02:59:52,920 --> 02:59:53,480
Who is this?

3030
02:59:53,980 --> 02:59:54,800
Who is this?

3031
02:59:55,020 --> 02:59:57,200
It's not Vernon if that's what you're thinking.

3032
02:59:58,100 --> 03:00:00,300
And you should really watch your tone.

3033
03:00:04,780 --> 03:00:06,320
I choose my next word.

3034
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:09,620
It's Ben.

3035
03:00:11,100 --> 03:00:12,400
What do you want for a minute?

3036
03:00:13,360 --> 03:00:13,600
What?

3037
03:00:17,990 --> 03:00:18,630
Virgil?

3038
03:00:22,370 --> 03:00:25,730
Episode 5, no time left!

3039
03:00:29,880 --> 03:00:32,120
Wow, I was majority for...

3040
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:35,660
For a lot of this.

3041
03:00:36,540 --> 03:00:40,020
You and 74% of players killed the boy in the attic.

3042
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:45,280
You and 33% of players threatened or lied to Vernon.

3043
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:49,580
You and 73% of players brought Clementine.

3044
03:00:50,460 --> 03:00:52,860
You and 66% of players pulled...

3045
03:00:52,860 --> 03:00:56,720
Well, O'Mean did not die, so honestly, we could have left her.

3046
03:00:57,020 --> 03:00:59,520
You and 66% of players pulled up Ben.

3047
03:00:59,960 --> 03:01:01,220
Most people did!

3048
03:01:03,780 --> 03:01:04,260
Wow.

3049
03:01:06,020 --> 03:01:07,980
Platypus, the next word is platypus.

3050
03:01:08,740 --> 03:01:10,640
You and 80% of players showed the bite.

3051
03:01:10,880 --> 03:01:11,360
Wow.

3052
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:13,080

You're like what kind of Where'd you get that bite mark girl?

3062
03:02:25,720 --> 03:02:29,620
The bite adds flavors better than a tattoo.

3063
03:02:32,300 --> 03:02:33,700
Have you heard about that?

3064
03:02:33,920 --> 03:02:35,800
How sometimes, like, I've seen this before.

3065
03:02:36,040 --> 03:02:45,800
Where, like, people will have, like, their partner, whatever, bite them, and then they'll get that tattooed on them.

3066
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:52,640
Do you guys want me to upload my bite mark so that you can get it?

3067
03:02:55,140 --> 03:02:57,840
Okay, you can get it tattooed on your body.

3068
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:07,720
Members content.

3069
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:09,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's members.

3070
03:03:10,300 --> 03:03:11,960
All my friends were there for me.

3071
03:03:12,340 --> 03:03:14,760
And Ben was also there too.

3072
03:03:16,360 --> 03:03:16,600
Yeah.

3073
03:03:20,360 --> 03:03:27,900
I'll upload a bite mark and then you can go get it tattooed wherever you want on your body.

3074
03:03:28,340 --> 03:03:31,540
You can have it on your leg like I was a crawling zombie.

3075
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:42,960
and i bit your leg and then you can show it off to people and be like i'm bit i'm bit i'm not gonna make it i'm not gonna make it from kissing paper to biting paper

3076
03:03:48,260 --> 03:03:52,980

3077
03:04:00,580 --> 03:04:06,100
i was bitten by a freak she came out of nowhere and just bit my leg.

3078
03:04:07,960 --> 03:04:09,860
I've seen tattooed kisses.

3079
03:04:10,820 --> 03:04:11,600
Tattooed kisses?

3080
03:04:14,400 --> 03:04:19,880
I feel like a tattooed kiss is already, you know, that's inherently sexy.

3081
03:04:20,540 --> 03:04:24,580
A bite mark, you can either say it's a zombie bite mark or it's a sexy bite mark.

3082
03:04:24,680 --> 03:04:26,120
But it depends on where you put it.

3083
03:04:29,580 --> 03:05:06,260
I think it depends on where you put it on your body she's been playing nothing but zombie games in her room for two months i've i've played so many zombie games recently i just can't stop thinking about zombies wherever people could make you regret that you know people will have my dental records that'd be kind of crazy if i if i did that i

3087
03:06:42,240 --> 03:06:44,200
For a ghost to have an angelic voice.

3088
03:06:46,860 --> 03:06:48,020
What happened to him?

3089
03:06:49,920 --> 03:06:53,500
Yeah, that's how I'd find out.

3090
03:06:54,260 --> 03:06:55,140
That's so sad.

3091
03:06:57,960 --> 03:07:00,080
Can you be normal for once in your life?

3092
03:07:01,260 --> 03:07:02,560
I don't have life.

3093
03:07:02,780 --> 03:07:03,580
I have afterlife.

3094
03:07:05,020 --> 03:07:06,220
I'm already dead.

3095
03:07:09,440 --> 03:07:19,480
Anyways guys Oh wait we have to see We have to see Oh You can Wait Huh?

3096

3097
03:07:32,540 --> 03:07:35,360

3098
03:07:38,390 --> 03:07:41,410

Okay, sorry.

I misunderstood this.

3102
03:07:46,370 --> 03:07:58,250
I thought this was like who you were with in like this whole episode or something.

3103
03:07:59,330 --> 03:08:00,750
But wait, wait.

3104
03:08:01,590 --> 03:08:02,870
Now actually I'm confused.

3105
03:08:03,450 --> 03:08:03,650
Oh, wait.

3106
03:08:04,250 --> 03:08:08,070
So yes, the three of them are coming with me.

3107
03:08:08,590 --> 03:08:10,010
Okay, some people only went.

3108
03:08:10,030 --> 03:08:30,690
with Ben some people went with Ben and Kenny okay for the finale some people brought the whole crew I think if we brought Ben I think we would die wait we are gonna die Sir Lee Long milk of the membership thank you so much I think we are gonna die because we're bit

3109
03:08:34,370 --> 03:08:39,430
wait so we're definitely wait so we're gonna die we're already dead

3110
03:08:42,990 --> 03:08:44,570
Maybe we're immune.

3111
03:08:50,010 --> 03:08:51,270
That's why you take Ben only.

3112
03:08:54,070 --> 03:08:56,230
Ben would not be a team player.

3113
03:08:58,250 --> 03:08:59,910
Some people only went by themselves.

3114
03:09:00,210 --> 03:09:00,690
That's crazy.

3115
03:09:01,850 --> 03:09:03,170
We have a good team with us.

3116
03:09:05,170 --> 03:09:05,190
Yeah.

3117
03:09:06,370 --> 03:09:09,190
I like how the majority picked just Keanu.

3118
03:09:12,540 --> 03:09:14,200
This was such an intense episode.

3119
03:09:14,880 --> 03:09:40,240
is okay i really thought crawford was going to be like i thought they were all gonna be alive i thought we were doing an actual i mean it was a sneaking mission but with zombos you mean that you mean that all the people in this place couldn't handle one zombo it was just the doctor maybe you'll get superpowers yeah yeah yeah

3120
03:09:46,260 --> 03:09:46,820
Hmm...

3121
03:09:46,820 --> 03:09:47,840
Embarrassing.

3122
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:48,300
Truly!

3123
03:09:49,520 --> 03:09:50,820
Can't wait for next episode.

3124
03:09:51,020 --> 03:09:51,600
Me too!

3125
03:09:52,780 --> 03:09:53,240
Me too.

3126
03:09:53,500 --> 03:09:54,860
We'll play in the next couple days.

3127
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:02,780
We have the next episode thing, right?

3128
03:10:06,420 --> 03:10:08,520
Survival of the Fish that he said.

3129
03:10:16,180 --> 03:10:17,300
So funny.

3130
03:10:18,440 --> 03:10:20,600
Next time on...

3131
03:10:20,600 --> 03:10:22,280
Dragon Ball...

3132
03:10:22,840 --> 03:10:24,420
Sea Safer Zombie.

3133
03:10:32,450 --> 03:10:33,450
Wolf Among Us.

3134
03:10:33,550 --> 03:10:35,130
People have been recommending that.

3135
03:10:35,790 --> 03:10:36,090
Yeah.

3136
03:10:37,170 --> 03:10:39,570
There's a new... Is it a Wolf Among Us game?

3137
03:10:39,730 --> 03:10:40,550
Or there's a new...

3138
03:10:41,430 --> 03:10:42,790
Telltale game or something.

3139
03:10:43,110 --> 03:10:43,790
Coming out, no?

3140
03:10:48,430 --> 03:10:49,170
Oh, Among Us.

3141
03:10:51,450 --> 03:10:52,570
Yeah, that's good.

3142
03:10:52,890 --> 03:10:53,770
Wolf Among Us 2.

3143
03:10:53,950 --> 03:10:54,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3144
03:11:06,330 --> 03:11:09,130
I wonder if I can We can do it in time before the next game, though.

3145
03:11:09,410 --> 03:11:09,890
Probably not.

3146
03:11:11,250 --> 03:11:12,710
If it's coming out so soon.

3147
03:11:17,790 --> 03:11:18,610
Hold on.

3148
03:11:18,650 --> 03:11:20,110
Let me look when it comes out.

3149
03:11:24,340 --> 03:11:25,840
Among us too.

3150
03:11:36,470 --> 03:11:37,970
Oh, does not have a release date.

3151
03:11:43,750 --> 03:11:43,950
Okay.

3152
03:11:44,490 --> 03:11:46,130
It's been saying soon for years.

3153
03:11:48,830 --> 03:11:51,850
Telltale Games delayed the game from 2023-2024.

3154
03:11:52,110 --> 03:11:52,190
Oh!

3155
03:11:56,360 --> 03:11:57,680
We didn't get one.

3156
03:12:06,220 --> 03:12:14,180
game has been coming out soon for like three years you got time okay cool no preview

3157
03:12:24,220 --> 03:12:39,200
wait oh i actually i actually teared up this episode first with the dog like the the boy in the dog um yeah

3158
03:12:42,440 --> 03:12:42,940
Oh.

3159
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:47,820
It gets you, y'all.

3160
03:12:48,180 --> 03:12:49,300
The burying scene.

3161
03:12:49,520 --> 03:12:50,360
So sad.

3162
03:12:51,940 --> 03:12:55,180
When we lost Chuck, we only lost one person this episode.

3163
03:12:56,020 --> 03:12:57,180
We could have lost two.

3164
03:12:57,860 --> 03:13:02,120
Well, I guess we lost Bree, but I don't really count her because we just met her.

3165
03:13:06,200 --> 03:13:09,180
Wolf Among Us 2 has been in dev for a longer time.

3166
03:13:09,200 --> 03:13:37,360
than silk song if you counted it started after season oh no yeah we lost chuck we technically lost molly i guess that's true that is true telltale almost bankrupt oh no kind of just met chuck too i guess that's fair Yeah, he only was around with us for like half an episode.

3167
03:13:39,440 --> 03:13:40,360
But he was good.

3168
03:13:41,280 --> 03:13:42,660
He saved Clem.

3169
03:13:42,840 --> 03:13:44,660
He saved Clem in time.

3170
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:46,480
Man.

3171
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:50,160
Oh.

3172
03:13:51,640 --> 03:13:52,840
He was good.

3173
03:13:55,420 --> 03:13:56,700
Yeah, Chuck was good.

3174
03:13:58,160 --> 03:13:59,760
He didn't deserve the way he died too.

3175
03:13:59,800 --> 03:14:00,460
It was crazy.

3176
03:14:02,060 --> 03:14:03,320
Well, I guess he actually...

3177
03:14:03,320 --> 03:14:04,800
Well, he...

3178
03:14:04,800 --> 03:14:07,920
It seems he took himself out and then they ate him.

3179
03:14:10,460 --> 03:14:11,180
Ah.

3180
03:14:16,370 --> 03:14:19,950
Oh, I think I'll cry next episode.

3181
03:14:21,510 --> 03:14:21,870
Lee!

3182
03:14:22,410 --> 03:14:23,330
No, Lee!

3183
03:14:24,210 --> 03:14:24,790
Lee!

3184
03:14:25,330 --> 03:14:26,290
No, Lee!

3185
03:14:29,470 --> 03:14:32,990
Oh, because of a stupid zombie jump scare!

3186
03:14:35,650 --> 03:14:37,970
I wonder if we'll tell Clem or not.

3187
03:14:38,770 --> 03:14:40,610
Well, I guess we have to, right?

3188
03:14:42,310 --> 03:14:44,910
Because we're gonna have to leave her, I guess.

3189
03:14:45,850 --> 03:14:47,450
Or, I don't know.

3190
03:15:04,010 --> 03:15:06,990
I'm still very curious who the radio guy is, too.

3191
03:15:09,690 --> 03:15:11,390
Who is that, man?

3192
03:15:12,610 --> 03:15:14,430
Why did he decide to take...

3193
03:15:14,450 --> 03:15:17,090
And she was upset.

3194
03:15:17,190 --> 03:15:20,470
I should have lied to her, so she wouldn't feel inclined to go with the guy.

3195
03:15:21,810 --> 03:15:25,210
I recommend Tales from the Borderlands for the thematic 180.

3196
03:15:26,390 --> 03:15:28,850
You also need to know absolutely nothing about Borderlands.

3197
03:15:29,190 --> 03:15:31,450
Oh, I don't know anything about Borderlands.

3198
03:15:33,330 --> 03:15:34,470
Phone guy.

3199
03:15:35,130 --> 03:15:35,290
Wow.

3200
03:15:35,650 --> 03:15:35,870
Wow.

3201
03:15:38,490 --> 03:15:38,870
Wow.

3202
03:15:38,870 --> 03:15:39,190
Wow.

3203
03:15:42,450 --> 03:15:43,050
Oh.

3204
03:15:43,050 --> 03:15:43,290
Oh.

3205
03:15:43,290 --> 03:15:43,610
Oh.

3206
03:15:43,610 --> 03:15:43,750
Oh.

3207
03:15:43,750 --> 03:15:43,870
Oh.

3208
03:15:44,210 --> 03:15:44,430
Oh.

3209
03:15:45,050 --> 03:15:50,490
Alright, well thank you guys for another episode of The Walking Dead and we will finish it next week.

3210
03:15:52,250 --> 03:15:55,630
But if anyone's really starved for more Wolf Among Us content, you could always read fables.

3211
03:15:55,950 --> 03:15:57,190
The comic it's based on.

3212
03:15:57,510 --> 03:15:58,530
Oh, there you go.

3213
03:16:00,090 --> 03:16:01,450
Thank you so much everybody.

3214
03:16:02,190 --> 03:16:04,230
Ah, I feel a little ah.

3215
03:16:06,530 --> 03:16:09,110
Since you're giving us recommendations, if you need more zombie web tunes.

3216
03:16:09,590 --> 03:16:09,930
Sweet home.

3217
03:16:10,070 --> 03:16:11,150
Oh, I read Sweet home.

3218
03:16:11,330 --> 03:16:11,890
Yes, I yes.

3219
03:16:12,170 --> 03:16:13,970
I read that one that was coming out.

3220
03:16:15,190 --> 03:16:16,490
Thank you, though.

3221
03:16:18,210 --> 03:16:19,450
Thanks for the super time!

3222
03:16:20,030 --> 03:16:21,030
Otsuminto, everybody!

3223
03:16:21,730 --> 03:16:22,210
Otsuminto.

3224
03:16:23,150 --> 03:16:24,530
I'm sad this episode.

3225
03:16:25,730 --> 03:16:26,390
I'm sad.

3226
03:16:28,370 --> 03:16:28,830
Yeah.

3227
03:16:29,370 --> 03:16:30,530
Thank you so much.

3228
03:16:30,850 --> 03:16:31,590
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3229
03:16:32,510 --> 03:16:34,290
Mint was talking about biting us.

3230
03:16:34,610 --> 03:16:35,330
The bite of 87.

3231
03:16:35,710 --> 03:16:36,350
The bite of 87!

3232
03:16:37,530 --> 03:16:38,690
Otsuminto, eat ita-shai!

3233
03:16:38,970 --> 03:16:40,150
I'll see you guys later.

3234
03:16:40,910 --> 03:16:41,410
Bye-bye.

3235
03:16:41,670 --> 03:16:42,610
Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye.

3236
03:16:42,930 --> 03:16:43,510
Bye-bye-bye-bye.

3237
03:16:43,890 --> 03:16:44,430
Thank you.

3238
03:16:44,450 --> 03:16:46,090
Thanks for hanging out with me.

3239
03:16:46,190 --> 03:16:46,470
Bye-bye.
