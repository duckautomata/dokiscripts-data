1
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,560
Shhh!

2
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,430
You love me!

3
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,350
Hahahaha!

4
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,500
Long hair!

5
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,160
Would you love me...

6
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,300
Even if I had no hair?

7
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,200
Look...

8
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,420
I lied.

9
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,040
There is a jump scare.

10
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,350
I forgot to do the face.

11
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,290
The chat disappeared.

12
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,250
Where did it go?

13
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,510
Yay!

14
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,490
Happy Valentine's Day!

15
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,650
I think whoever that was summoned a pretty clingy ghost.

16
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,690
Yay!

17
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,490
Let me put on some music.

18
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,470
Yay!

19
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,890
I was so nervous everything was going to go okay.

20
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,790
And it seemed mostly okay.

21
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,670
There was a few things I think I messed up, but that's okay!

22
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,660
Music, music, music.

23
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,280
Here we go.

24
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,880
Yay!

25
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,360
And if you guys saw, I gave you a choice.

26
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,960
Did I not?

27
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,840
But you only care about one, huh?

28
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,180
You don't want to see the other, do you?

29
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,380
You don't want to see the other one, do you?

30
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,620
I understand.

31
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:29,940
We do?

32
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,100
We do?

33
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,420
Please?

34
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:41,940
Okay.

35
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,500
The other one.

36
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,640
Are you ready?

37
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,840
Let me put my arms up too.

38
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,420
Yay!

39
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,000
Yay!

40
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,960
I finally have my new hair!

41
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,240
I

42
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:33,670
have some other announcements that you might have seen mid-stream perhaps.

43
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,790
Number one!

44
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,730
Mint's Ghost of a Chance Valentine Collection!

45
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,290
Yay!

46
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,510
We got three things.

47
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:54,090
There was supposed to be one more thing, but it ended up not working out this time.

48
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,790
But I'm very excited for it, for when it does work out.

49
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,470
So you have the voice pack.

50
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,450
Of a confession.

51
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,390
I felt that the Valentine's Collection was so...

52
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,890
Valentine's-like that...

53
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,350
That...

54
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:17,090
I needed to make the stream a little spookier than...

55
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,310
Than...

56
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,510
What...

57
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,870
It had to be balanced, you know?

58
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,770
And then they have an indirect kiss mug.

59
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,930
What does that mean?

60
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:29,790
Do you guys see?

61
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,370
Do you guys see that lip stain?

62
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,930
That's my reel!

63
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,030
I practiced kissing paper 13 times.

64
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,070
So that...

65
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,210
You could...

66
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,450
So that it would look good.

67
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,170
So I tweeted about that, even.

68
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,990
I was just like, I...

69
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,450
I kissed paper.

70
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,630
And now you know the reason why!

71
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,310
Then,

72
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,310
of course, the little Wisp plush pen, which is so cute.

73
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,950
It's so squeezable, you can push, push, push, push.

74
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,310
And plush, plush, plush, plush.

75
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,850
So, yeah!

76
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,330
Store.ghostmade.cafe.

77
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,870
It's a little bit different than my old link.

78
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,150
So, keep that in mind.

79
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,490
And then the second announcement!

80
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,010
That...

81
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,010
That was done on the stream!

82
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:39,670
Wait, hold on.

83
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,010
Sorry.

84
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:42,890
This...

85
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:44,650
Small...

86
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,130
Ta-da!

87
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,710
Oh my gosh.

88
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,730
You guys!

89
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:52,910
You guys!

90
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:01,810
Me and Ayami Mama will be doing a collaboration cafe together in Akihabara!

91
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,610
My favorite, favorite, favorite place ever!

92
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,650
And it will be from March 8th to March 16th.

93
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:22,130
Which, if you guys are going to a certain other Vtuber event happening that weekend, it might be the perfect time to go!

94
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:29,030
And I definitely wasn't the one to say, Ayami Mama, you should put it that weekend.

95
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:35,310
There will maybe be lots of people in Japan who don't usually get to go!

96
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,090
So...

97
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

99
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,450
So, yeah!

100
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,390
If you have a chance, there will be original merchandise!

101
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,850
And we created our own menu and everything!

102
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,250
So, I'm very, very excited.

103
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,650
And I will be there.

104
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,930
I will be there.

105
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,270
That's why I'm going to Japan.

106
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:12,170
So I can try the menu and film some stuff that will be playing in the cafe.

107
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,630
And, yeah!

108
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,210
And then, of course, the last announcement was going to be my two hairstyles.

109
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,290
I'm nervous.

110
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,970
Oh my gosh, it's only been... This hasn't even been a half hour!

111
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,640
I didn't eat dinner.

112
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,640
Because I was editing up until...

113
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,300
Pretty close to the stream.

114
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,980
But, yeah!

115
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,360
I hope you guys liked the stream.

116
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh, if you didn't realize, if you didn't notice, the website is real!

117
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:08,320
I basically had to relearn basic HTML to create it.

118
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,100
I tried and I probably put way too much effort.

119
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,400
That's honestly what took the most amount of time.

120
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:28,000
Was me trying to make the website as accurate feeling as I could to like an old Geocities website.

121
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:37,880
And I wrote everything on it too, so there's some things that probably you couldn't read during the stream.

122
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,780
Like Cassie's diary.

123
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,900
I had a lot of fun writing those.

124
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,900
And...

125
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,100
Yeah.

126
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,740
Is the ritual real too?

127
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,720
I don't know.

128
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,840
I don't know.

129
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,660
Oh my gosh!

130
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,400
My tab crashed.

131
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,080
The one that I was showing you the window.

132
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,920
I think it crashed because I had... It was repeating too many times maybe.

133
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,800
Thank you for all the superchats you guys!

134
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,620
Thank you!

135
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,680
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

136
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,940
So I hope you guys liked the stream.

137
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,840
It was a little...

138
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,000
I didn't want

139
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:49,280
it to be super overtly spooky, but it's kind of my type of spooky that I like.

140
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,440
Where it's just a little bit more subtle sometimes.

141
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,740
Oh yeah, the poll.

142
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,740
Goodbye poll.

143
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,840
Goodbye poll.

144
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,300
Laptop loop was amazing.

145
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,620
I'm glad you liked it!

146
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,840
The keyboard noises are real.

147
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,480
Yeah, I did everything.

148
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,340
I did everything by myself.

149
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,840
I even had that conversation with myself.

150
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,440
I signed into two different discords on two different browsers.

151
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,820
One was on my phone and one was on the...

152
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,420
One was on the computer.

153
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,760
And so I was... It was a one man show!

154
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,780
I did everything.

155
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,240
Obviously I'm not good enough to do like... What's it called?

156
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,420
Full like website layouts or anything.

157
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,860
So those were all like templates and stuff, but I had to...

158
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:49,120
I had to move stuff around and I was just like, why is this broken?

159
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,260
Yeah, don't look at the coding, okay?

160
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,700
There's no secrets in the coding!

161
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,260
But there is... I do... I think the site is kind of fun.

162
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,620
I had more stuff I wanted to do for the site too.

163
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:12,460
Like I wanted to have a guestbook that you could go to, but I just didn't have enough time to implement it.

164
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:20,260
Because basically I had to make the website as fast as I could, but I was so stuck on being such a perfectionist about certain parts of it...

165
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:30,080
That I... I... I... I could only film everything today.

166
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:30,720
Oh!

167
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,540
Did you guys like the hands?

168
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,400
Those are my hands too!

169
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,000
I filmed that.

170
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,700
Basically I didn't have a green screen or anything, so it was super makeshift and everything.

171
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,460
Oh my gosh, it took so much finagling with the chroma key to get it right.

172
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:57,580
But yeah, I hope you guys liked it.

173
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,720
And then, oh, the page with everybody's stories!

174
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,460
Last night, in a desperate plea to not have to write anything with my own brain anymore...

175
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:19,680
Because I was like, oh my gosh, this would be the perfect time to use ChatGPT, but I just don't use ChatGPT.

176
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,940
I was coming up with everything myself, and I was like, my brain is fried!

177
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:31,640
And so I was like, I need customer test... Not customer, but spooky story testimonials.

178
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:39,680
And so I... I put out a desperate cry for memboos.

179
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,260
If you're not a memboo...

180
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,720
I also... Sorry, my brain is still frazzled.

181
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,000
I also gifted a... What's it called?

182
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,540
A wallpaper.

183
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,860
And I put out a plea in the middle of the night and was like, please, help me!

184
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,980
Just send me some stuff!

185
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,980
Wallpaper.

186
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,980
Wallpaper.

187
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,240
Wallpaper.

188
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,840
So...

189
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

190
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,840
But yeah.

191
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,100
I hope you guys have been having a good Valentine's Day.

192
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:37,120
I don't have much else I wanted to do because I kind of wanted to keep the stream short so that people could rewatch the...

193
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Well, not rewatch, but watch it pretty easily if they wanted to.

194
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,340
But I saw many, many, many people doing karaoke for Valentine's Day.

195
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,940
And I was like...

196
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:55,520
I was like, well, I also want to kind of do Valentine's karaoke, but everybody's doing it.

197
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,160
I came up with two songs.

198
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,000
I was like, I'll do one song with my long hair and one song with my twin tails.

199
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,320
But I was like, okay, I know the one song.

200
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,460
And I was going to do one Japanese, one English.

201
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:16,040
But I was going to do... The song I picked for Japanese song, I was like, wait, this isn't a love song.

202
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,060
I was going to choose Fansa, but it's not really a love song.

203
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:28,600
So...

204
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,190
I don't know what to sing a love song.

205
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,530
I don't know.

206
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,050
Fansa's sad song?

207
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,310
What?

208
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:43,970
No, it's not.

209
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,050
It's all about, like, supporting an idol.

210
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,730
It's like the opposite of love song.

211
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,950
It's the opposite of love song.

212
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,930
Oh, really happy I could be a part of this, Mito.

213
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,390
Oh, yes, thank you!

214
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:06,990
I wonder if the people who submitted their pictures were so shocked to see themselves on the screen.

215
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,070
Mom, that's me!

216
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,950
It's a love song for idol otaku.

217
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:12,810
So true.

218
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,470
Love the turrets!

219
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,180
Okay, I'll sing then.

220
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,580
I can sing Fansa and I can sing the other song.

221
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:36,580
I'll sing them and then I'll let you guys get back to all the cooler Valentine's activities that many people are doing, so...

222
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,260
Sound design was top notch.

223
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,580
See, I was listening to it and I didn't have time to listen to...

224
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,660
I noticed some errors, so if you heard any weird... If you heard any errors, sorry.

225
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,540
No, you didn't.

226
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,780
No, you didn't.

227
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:52,620
Okay.

228
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,620
Some of the sound design, I was like, oh, I should have balanced that better.

229
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,500
Sorry.

230
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:00,840
Okay.

231
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,400
Okay.

232
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,440
Let's sing!

233
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,100
Let's sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing.

234
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,800
Also, do you notice Chiyo down here?

235
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,420
I saw... I found that GIF of her when I was...

236
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,400
When I was searching for older 2000 GIFs.

237
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,540
Even though Chiyo is not from 2000, but...

238
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,500
I guess her aesthetic is...

239
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,560
Actually, she's an old VTuber.

240
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,500
Very 2000 looking.

241
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,480
Yeah, very 2000's energy.

242
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,540
Please don't leave Valentine's with yesterday for me!

243
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,260
Wow.

244
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,200
I'm so tired after rushing to complete this.

245
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,540
I hope you guys don't mind that it's a shorter stream.

246
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,940
No delay.

247
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,480
This is the long hair song.

248
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,550
The milky twilight, the

249
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,180
fireflies and silver moon sparkling.

250
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,140
So kiss me.

251
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,680
Or, you could get the indirect kiss mug!

252
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,540
Kissed by yours truly!

253
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,940
Indirectly!

254
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,560
Kiss me.

255
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,380
Down by the broken tree house.

256
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,240
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map.

257
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,260
Kiss me.

258
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,100
Beneath the milky twilight.

259
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,460
So kiss me.

260
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,340
Kiss me.

261
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,620
Beneath the milky

262
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:41,770
twilight.

263
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,960
Strike up the band and make the silver moon sparkling.

264
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,860
So kiss me.

265
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,360
So

266
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,400
kiss me.

267
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,600
No, it's not.

268
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,620
Oh, I can vote for it.

269
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,060
Vote!

270
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,100
Okay!

271
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,980
Thank you guys!

272
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,120
I hope you like the Valentine's!

273
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,960
I know it's much, much shorter probably than you anticipated, but...

274
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,980
Um...

275
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,300
Yeah!

276
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,340
Yeah, but you know...

277
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,020
Like, I know it's a busy night too, so probably much going on.

278
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,140
You can check out lots of other stuff too!

279
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,760
I'm gonna eat dinner!

280
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,600
Mintos are cute!

281
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,530
Thank you guys for all the superchats!

282
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,290
Thank you for all the beverages!

283
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,510
It was so funny when the chat came up and all you guys started spamming the green...

284
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,370
The member...member messages.

285
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,710
It was funny.

286
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,270
It was funny.

287
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,190
Okay!

288
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,190
Okay!

289
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,890
Fun stuff!

290
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,400
Oh, I might have to adjust the audio though.

291
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,100
Let me see.

292
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,630
That might be okay.

293
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,010
Okay!

294
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:53,300
Suki ni natte motto watashi wo mite motto Ongaeshi wa ai no komotta nagekisu de Ki no sei janai me wa atteru yo Heart tsukutte koi shichatte kudasai I'll do anything I can do.

295
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,760
I'll challenge anything without NG.

296
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,260
I found the anti-comment on Egaso.

297
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,780
I know it better than anyone else.

298
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,460
But it's okay.

299
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,960
If I stand here, everyone is here.

300
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:10,780
Let's go!

301
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,600
Fall in love with me more.

302
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,340
Look at me more.

303
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,380
Give me back my love.

304
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,400
With a love-filled kiss.

305
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,560
Fall in love with me more.

306
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,280
Show me your dream more.

307
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,300
Enjoy it.

308
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,980
A love-filled special night.

309
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,540
Let's have fun!

310
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,380
I can't believe I can spell MOTO with the emoji!

311
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,220
It's so fun!

312
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,160
Please write me a letter.

313
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,740
I'll read it over and over again.

314
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,900
I'll treasure it.

315
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,180
It's still too early for a scandal.

316
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,900
But I won't betray you.

317
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
I'll make a declaration.

318
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,160
I won't lose to jealousy and harassment.

319
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,060
I'll win with my mischievous ability.

320
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,660
So I won't stop.

321
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,740
I won't lose.

322
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,100
I'm here.

323
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:18,940
Let's go!

324
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,840
Raise your fists more.

325
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,840
Sweat more.

326
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,460
Give me back my love.

327
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,120
With a love-filled kiss.

328
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,600
Fall in love with me more.

329
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,520
Show me your dream more.

330
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,880
Enjoy it.

331
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,830
I'll pass it to you.

332
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,680
It's getting closer.

333
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,400
I'm lonely.

334
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,140
It's fun, but I'm about to cry.

335
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,280
I

336
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,620
need you next time.

337
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,760
Let's get stronger.

338
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,820
Enjoy it.

339
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,060
Don't forget more.

340
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,360
I hope it will be a special day.

341
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,860
Let's sing together forever.

342
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,560
Let's walk together forever.

343
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,520
I love you.

344
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,780
Fall in love with me more.

345
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,760
Show me your dream more.

346
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,600
Give me back my love.

347
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,340
With a love-filled kiss.

348
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,500
Show me your dream more.

349
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,860
Enjoy it.

350
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,860
I'll pass it to you.

351
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,840
I have to do it myself.

352
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:14,420
Bing bing bong...

353
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,320
This is the ending screen.

354
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:53,750

Bing bong, bing bing bing bong...

356
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,110
When will she end the stream?

357
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:05,810
Who knows?

358
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,450
Bing bing bing bong...
