00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,290

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,930

4
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:02,950

The room was completely black.

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,320
I hugged her and she hugged back.

14
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,460
Like a sinner said, quote, ain't that a hole in the boat?

15
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,020
My head keeps spinning.

16
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,880

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:21,760

Hello everyone, I hope you're having a wonderful time today.

48
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,170
The name is Miri Celesta, your local Izakai guild leader and
adventurer on duty.

49
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,430
It is such a huge honor for me to be able to sing here
today.

50
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,250
We are happy to present to you.

51
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,250
I've got you under my skin.

52
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,330
I've

53
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,690
got you under my skin.

54
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,750
I've got you deep in the heart of me.

55
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:34,310
You're so deep in my heart, you're really a part of me.

56
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,750
I've got you under my skin.

57
00:12:43,010 --> 00:13:01,530
I've tried so not to give in I've said to myself this affair
never will go so well But why should I try to resist when

58
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:18,610
darling I know so well But I've got you under my skin I'd
sacrifice anything, come what might, for the sake of having

59
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:28,890
you near In spite of a warning voice that comes in at the
night And repeats and repeats in my ear Don't you know,

60
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:46,310
little fool, you never can win Use your mentality, wake up
to reality But each time that I do, just the thought of you

61
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,410
makes me stop before I begin.

62
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,810
Because I've got you under my skin.

63
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,260
You never can win.

64
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,260
Use your mentality.

65
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:34,100
But each time that I do, just the thought of you makes me
stop before I begin.

66
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,160
Because I've got you under my skin.

67
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,160
And I'll love you under my skin.

68
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,240
Under my skin.

69
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,680
Yes, I've got you under my skin.

70
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,760
Thank you so much.

71
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Thank you, beauty.

72
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,990
Thank you, thank you.

73
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,370
It was so lovely seeing you here today.

74
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,690
Hope you enjoyed the rest of the show.

75
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,950
Thank you so much.

76
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:17,850
Thank you.

77
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,290
Thank you to the lovely beauty, Celesto.

78
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,530
One more round of applause for her.

79
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:34,750
When I was thinking of the show, I was like, I must invite
Miori because her voice is just, oh, she, her jazz is so

80
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:43,670
good, so, I'm really happy to have been able to sing with
her, so, yes, yes, yes, oh, I'm so nervous, you guys, oh,

81
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:54,590
thank you, oh, but yeah, we still have, what, chicken,
what'd you say?

82
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,510
Stabby, stabby.

83
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,530
Stabby.

84
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,550
Okay, are you guys ready for some more?

85
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:04,830
Yes!

86
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,470
Oh, wiki, oki.

87
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,150
I almost said alright and oki-doki at the end.

88
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,090
I was like, o-riki-do-riki.

89
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,610
Oki-doki, let's continue onwards to the next song!

90
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:32,930
This song, I chose because, you know, it's Valentine's Day,
but Some people don't have a Valentine, so it's okay.

91
00:16:36,790 --> 00:17:04,500
In my solitude, you honed to me with reveries of dead gone
by

92
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:35,270
in my solitude you taunt me with memories that never die

93
00:17:38,510 --> 00:18:06,040
I sit in my chair I'm filled with despair There's no one
could be so sad With gloom everywhere I sit and I stare I

94
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,920
know that I'll soon go home back.

95
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,100
In my solitude,

96
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,420
I'm praying.

97
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:37,980
Dear Lord, above, send back my love.

98
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:54,720
Dear Lord above, send back my love.
