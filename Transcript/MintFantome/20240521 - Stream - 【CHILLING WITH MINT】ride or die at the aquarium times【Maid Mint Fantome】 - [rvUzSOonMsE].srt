1
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,800
Oh no!

2
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,080
I forgot tea!

3
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,140
I forgot tea!

4
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,160
Oh no!

5
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,020
I forgot to get a drink!

6
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,430
Oh well.

7
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:01,710
It's been a couple of days.

8
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,190
Did you miss me?

9
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,950
Did you miss me?

10
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,050
You have customers.

11
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,330
They're... they're doing their own thing.

12
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,470
They told me... I walked over there and I was just like, would you like me to serve you?

13
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,490
And they said, actually, please don't come over here.

14
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,150
Don't even look at us.

15
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,870
Don't even bother us.

16
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,950
So don't worry about it.

17
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,270
I think they're... I think they're up to no good.

18
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,650
Hey Mint, yes I miss you.

19
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,130
Yippee!

20
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,250
Yippee!

21
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,970
Sorry, we're booked for a private event.

22
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,590
Yeah, exactly.

23
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,230
Thank you!

24
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,810
Oh wait, hold on.

25
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,990
Welcome back, boss.

26
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,230
Thank you!

27
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,570
Thank you so much.

28
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,390
I went away.

29
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,650
I went away.

30
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,510
I went away.

31
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,510
Actually, if you listen to the...

32
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,430
If you listen... well...

33
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,510
Maybe for some people, you already know.

34
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,110
I talked about it in the podcast a little bit.

35
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,910
I went to...

36
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,350
Did you miss us?

37
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,460
Yeah.

38
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,660
Is that Jerma in your cafe?

39
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,200
Is that what Jerma looks like?

40
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,900
I don't think Jerma has glasses.

41
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,320
That's Jerma.

42
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,200
I talked about it a little bit on the podcast if you listened.

43
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,880
If you listened today, thank you for listening.

44
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,760
If you haven't listened to it yet, thank you for listening to it in the future.

45
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,920
And if you are... haven't listened to it, why not?

46
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Thank you!

47
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,120
Thank you!

48
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,780
Thank you!

49
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,020
And the waitress is too shy and introverted to call out the customers bringing outside food into the cafe.

50
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,280
Wait, you're not allowed to do?

51
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,180
Bring outside food?

52
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,380
Thank you for the red soup!

53
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,620
Inspired me to go to a con recently.

54
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,280
It's a lot of fun and even though I didn't cosplay, I felt like a fish out of water.

55
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,020
I still have fun recognizing and taking pictures with several cosplayers.

56
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,980
Now I'm planning what I want to cosplay as next time I go.

57
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's go!

58
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,660
Wait, where did you go?

59
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,260
Where did you go?

60
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,880
I'm sure those things are the 10 gifted.

61
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,960
And blind bot, welcome to membership.

62
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,120
Thank you!

63
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,440
I was at the dentist during the podcast, that's why.

64
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,880
You should have listened to it with your dentist.

65
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,460
They would have been like...

66
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,700
Oh my god, they would have had a hold on your teeth.

67
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,460
They would have grabbed it.

68
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,840
They would have gripped it.

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,920
They would have firmly grasped it.

70
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,160
They would have been like...

71
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,680
Listening to it and just gripping your teeth.

72
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,660
In anticipation of what we were talking about.

73
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,620
The dentist would have said...

74
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,920
Based?

75
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,380
Based?

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,320
Maybe.

77
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,740
I don't know.

78
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,440
But yeah, I've talked about it.

79
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,640
I've said this like three times now.

80
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,200
Talked about it a little bit on the podcast.

81
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,540
And I went to a convention.

82
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,800
I went to Anime Central.

83
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,220
And I made a surprise appearance at Ayami Sensei's panel.

84
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,440
It was so last minute.

85
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,120
Oh my gosh.

86
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,240
It was extremely last minute.

87
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,220
Surprise?

88
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,300
Question mark, question mark, question mark.

89
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,920
Okay, it was a surprise.

90
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,100
Because there was no plan for me to be in that panel.

91
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,460
Until...

92
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,340
Maybe like ten minutes before the panel.

93
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,780
And then...

94
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,380
Ayami Sensei called to me.

95
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,960
She was like, Mito-chan!

96
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,520
Join my panel!

97
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,340
And I was like...

98
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,120
Is it okay?

99
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:16,980
Because...

100
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,000
It's your panel.

101
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,780
Like, you're the guest.

102
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,040
I felt really bad.

103
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,980
I was like, you're the guest.

104
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,440
People are coming to see you.

105
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,620
Not me.

106
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,080
And so...

107
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,680
That's hella last minute.

108
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,320
It was extremely last minute.

109
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,620
What was the panel about?

110
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,560
She tried snacks.

111
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,260
American snacks.

112
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,840
So...

113
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,380
Some of them I gave to her and some of them were given by fans.

114
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,900
So I saw someone say that they didn't get the meet and greet tickets were off, Kai.

115
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,320
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,960
I think I've seen several people saying that.

117
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,060
I've seen...

118
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,340
I've seen very few people saying that they've gotten tickets and more people saying that they didn't get tickets.

119
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,400
Welcome back!

120
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,660
We might have missed you or something.

121
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,660
Thank you.

122
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,980
Sold out already?

123
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,640
No, no!

124
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,500
They weren't...

125
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,200
They weren't sold.

126
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,280
They were a...

127
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,740
They were a...

128
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,180
A lottery.

129
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Actually, it's funny because...

130
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,720
When I...

131
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,360
When I...

132
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,880
I mentioned to Sensei, to Ayami Sensei that...

133
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,360
Her meet and greet...

134
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,180
Her autograph session at Anime Central also sold out.

135
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,320
Which I didn't get.

136
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,780
I don't know.

137
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,100
I say sold out, but they were free, I'm pretty sure.

138
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,060
But...

139
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,560
When I showed her that, I was like, they're completely full.

140
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,040
And she was like, yeah.

141
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,640
Thank you!

142
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,940
Can't stick around, so I'll catch the vibe.

143
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,260
Have a good night!

144
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,740
Um...

145
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,120
Also...

146
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,840
Cor... Cor...

147
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,960
Corio...

148
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,060
Finis...

149
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,460
Bugs is like...

150
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,120
A...

151
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,580
Bug...

152
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,260
Don...

153
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,100
Nuat.

154
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,660
No.

155
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,900
Thanks, Yoko.

156
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:19,980
Um...

157
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,720
They were free.

158
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,720
They were free, right?

159
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,100
Most of her merch sold out.

160
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,460
I...

161
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,140
I know!

162
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,980
I know!

163
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,600
I know!

164
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,600
Um...

165
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,040
But when I showed her that, she was just like...

166
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,860
Actually...

167
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,000
So many of my fans said that they...

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,640
They didn't make it...

169
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,720
Into the...

170
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,140
Into the autograph session, so...

171
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,620
Who...

172
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,200
Who made it in?

173
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,320
And now I'm thinking that, I'm like...

174
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Wait, so many people...

175
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,340
Are saying that they didn't make it in...

176
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,320
To my meet and greet, so...

177
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,440
Who's showing up?

178
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,440
Who's...

179
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,200
Who's gonna be there?

180
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,420
Poor boyfriend.

181
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,100
I know!

182
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,220
Really happy she did so well.

183
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,620
Me too!

184
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,020
It seems like she had a lot of fun.

185
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,020
She...

186
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,760
She...

187
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,640
Kept thanking me a lot.

188
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,160
Which I was like...

189
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,640
You know...

190
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,400
I just...

191
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,300
I just did your panel.

192
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,340
I really didn't do anything.

193
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:15,960
But she...

194
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,380
She was saying that...

195
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,020
Lurkers?

196
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,520
Probably?

197
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,040
Maybe!

198
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,640
Who knows?

199
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,940
Who knows?

200
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,980
Who knows?

201
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,340
But...

202
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,220
Hopefully...

203
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,100
Even if not at the...

204
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,580
Official meet and greet...

205
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,120
Maybe we can find another way to...

206
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,800
Um...

207
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,980
To meet...

208
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,000
Somehow...

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,620
During the convention...

210
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,800
If you will be at Ofukai.

211
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,720
And if you won't be at Ofukai...

212
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,680
Maybe...

213
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,160
You...

214
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,400
Maybe...

215
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
I'll be at another event that you'll be going to.

216
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,900
So...

217
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,940
Mmm...

218
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,640
Yeah...

219
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,040
Yeah...

220
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,520
So...

221
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,280
I don't know...

222
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,720
Hmm...

223
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,160
You've got lots of fan's mint...

224
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,900
I don't know...

225
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,440
I don't know...

226
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,460
Hmm...

227
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm in North...

228
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,700
I'll be in the parking lot!

229
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,860
Let's go!

230
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,660
Yeah...

231
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,940
I'll be in the parking lot!

232
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,320
At Adam...

233
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,500
At Adam in North, I'm going to be in the parking lot!

234
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,620
I will be singing in the parking lot...

235
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,760
Chuu!

236
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,060
Chuu!

237
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:25,460
Chuu!

238
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:25,500
Chuu!

239
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,280
Chuu!

240
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,100
Glad you had fun with Ayame-sensei this weekend.

241
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,880
Also congrats on your upcoming concert appearance.

242
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,420
I can't go but I'll be cheering you on in spirit.

243
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,800
Thank you!

244
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,180
Yes!

245
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,480
And that was announced too!

246
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,340
I will be appearing at a concert.

247
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,800
Thank you!

248
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,040
Thank you!

249
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
Well liked, popular person.

250
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,330
Heard there was a Vtuber who had their meet and greet tickets sold out but only recognized one from their chat.

251
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,070
So hopefully you have better luck.

252
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:55,370
Oh!

253
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:55,910
Wait!

254
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,270
You said... Oh sorry, hold on.

255
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:04,470
Heard that there was a Vtuber who had a meet and greet ticket sold out but only recognized one person from the chat.

256
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:04,910
What?

257
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:05,830
That's crazy.

258
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,050
I don't know.

259
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,670
Even though, you know, it is still also exciting to meet new people.

260
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,410
So I hope there's no one listening who's just like, I'm a lurker and I got a meet and greet.

261
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,870
She's not excited to meet me.

262
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,450
No, no.

263
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,790
I am still very excited.

264
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:27,670
So...

265
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,590
What is Otacon doing there behind you?

266
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,670
They're having a barbecue!

267
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,930
They're having a barbecue.

268
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,170
Don't worry about it.

269
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,350
Don't worry about it.

270
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,270
Hold on, I'm gonna eat some more of my cereal.

271
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,450
I got Reese's Puffs!

272
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,570
I hope it doesn't hurt my stomach.

273
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,770
It should be okay.

274
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,710
Minto hates me.

275
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,450
No!

276
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,380
Peanut butter chocolate flavor!

277
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,180
Welcome to membership.

278
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:13,780
Thank you!

279
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,800
Nah, I'm gonna mute.

280
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,900
I'm embarrassed.

281
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,680
Casual lurker, but sad I couldn't see you at ASEN.

282
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,320
Maybe next con, but yeah.

283
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,720
Yeah.

284
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,500
Sorry if you couldn't make it to the IME panel.

285
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,740
Like I said, it really was.

286
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,720
Like so last minute.

287
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,120
So even if it's just like...

288
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,980
Announced it beforehand...

289
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,420
There was no time beforehand...

290
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
For you...

291
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,400
For maybe some people to go.

292
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,000
So...

293
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,540
Sorry.

294
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,260
But hopefully I can go to...

295
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,240
Another con as an official guest.

296
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,160
How did the drawing go?

297
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,640
Oh!

298
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,700
I...

299
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,440
Did you guys...

300
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,740
Hold on.

301
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,900
Let me get the picture.

302
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,280
From...

303
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,020
From Sensei's...

304
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
From Sensei's...

305
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,780
Twitter?

306
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,680
Ayame.

307
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,720
Oh, good.

308
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,020
She's not shadow banned anymore.

309
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,520
At least for a while, I couldn't search her.

310
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,430
Thank you.

311
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,150
Chuu!

312
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,950
Save image.

313
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,050
Okay.

314
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:40,890
Okay.

315
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,870
This is how the drawing came out.

316
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,450
LeBron James, scream if you love me.

317
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,730
Isn't it so cute?

318
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,950
She made me look so shy and cute.

319
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,310
And people were telling me at the end of the panel...

320
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,450
That...

321
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,630
A strange shadow happened.

322
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,350
I don't know...

323
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,930
Like that...

324
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,130
But when we talked...

325
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,210
She said she was gonna give me a hangout.

326
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,410
What happened?

327
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,410
Did she get shy?

328
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,070
Maybe.

329
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,810
Maybe she got shy.

330
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,890
And made me as shy as she felt.

331
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:33,830
You know?

332
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,310
Who knows?

333
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,290
The shadow had so much power.

334
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,530
Sussy intentions... Was it...

335
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,350
Was it...

336
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,450
Was it...

337
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,530
Was it...

338
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,390
A pickle shape?

339
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,330
What kind of shadow was it?

340
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,950
When people were saying that there was a sussy shadow, I was like...

341
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,290
What do you mean by that?

342
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:08,570
Wow!

343
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,310
Thank you for the Akazuba!

344
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,010
I'm glad you had fun at Ace and hope I'll be lucky enough to see you at Off-Kai soon!

345
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,510
You're so fun to see!

346
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,410
Even if I can't be here all the time, have a good rest of your stream!

347
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,510
Thank you Luna!

348
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,990
Thank you!

349
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,870
Thank you!

350
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,430
Thank you!

351
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,390
Thank you so much!

352
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:33,810
Haunted pickle?

353
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,650
Was it hedgehog shaped?

354
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,560
What kind of shadow if there's anybody who...

355
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,660
Went to the...

356
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,160
Anybody who went to the panel?

357
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,800
I assume she was like looming over you.

358
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,900
What do you mean looming over me?

359
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,780
The hedgehog?

360
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,080
No!

361
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,080
Not the hedgehog!

362
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
I was like why are you guys keep hearing of a hedgehog?

363
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,120
It was an incomprehension.

364
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,160
Oh, because I said shadow like the hedgehog.

365
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,640
No!

366
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,340
There was...

367
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,720
Oh my gosh!

368
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,480
Thank you for the...

369
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,620
Stop please!

370
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,320
Thank you!

371
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,900
I could have been there but I got a puppy this month.

372
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,160
That's exciting too though, right?

373
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,260
Oh my gosh!

374
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,940
Does it pee and poo everywhere?

375
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,340
I love Latina Sonic.

376
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,160
Shadow like the hedgehog.

377
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, I get it now.

378
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,840
Dogo, welcome to membership.

379
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,640
Thank you!

380
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,150
Oh, it was sensei's shadow while you were saying no ecchi, don't lewd.

381
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,850
Wait, really?

382
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,190
Wait, actually?

383
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,850
Is that her impression of me?

384
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,930
I see.

385
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:20,930
I see.

386
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,980
I feel like I need to get this framed and put on my wall.

387
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,670
No, ecchi, don't lewd.

388
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,690
That doesn't sound like you.

389
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,250
Well, I mean, for me... I mean, I'm still embarrassed by it.

390
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,810
But...

391
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,970
I don't dislike ecchi and lewd things.

392
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,790
I think... I think maybe everybody knows that by now.

393
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,730
What was it?

394
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,090
What was it?

395
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,370
Oh...

396
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,010
I...

397
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,590
I was...

398
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,590
I was...

399
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,090
Oh...

400
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,550
There was a booth at Anime Central that was selling...

401
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,930
That was selling...

402
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,470
Actually, there were several booths selling doujins.

403
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,750
I was so shocked how many there were.

404
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,190
And...

405
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,430
One of them was just like, I'm haunted...

406
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,250
I'm haunted by...

407
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,610
Something.

408
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,550
And I...

409
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,830
I...

410
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,750
At the time, I was just like, oh...

411
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,050
I'll come back for it because...

412
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,470
Because...

413
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,690
Um...

414
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,910
Because I didn't have a bag that could fit it.

415
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,410
Like, I didn't want to carry it around.

416
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:48,030
I wasn't going back to my hotel room to put it away anytime soon.

417
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,930
And so, I...

418
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,910
I...

419
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,210
I...

420
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,070
I...

421
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,990
I went back...

422
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,570
The next day...

423
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,690
And...

424
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,250
And...

425
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,370
It was gone!

426
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,130
I was so surprised!

427
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,310
I was like...

428
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,370
Are ghosts in demand?

429
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:07,730
Maybe?

430
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,530
I think I know which one you're talking about.

431
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,050
Yeah, it's sold out!

432
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,930
Are ghosts in demand?

433
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,650
Yes, they are.

434
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:21,890
Oh!

435
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,370
Oh!

436
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,290
They saw you eyeing it.

437
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,950
No!

438
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,210
No, no, they couldn't have.

439
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:27,750
I'm a ghost.

440
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,530
They couldn't have.

441
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,790
They couldn't have seen me.

442
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:32,690
I'm a ghost.

443
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,850
But I did, like, kind of haunt the booth a little bit.

444
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,270
I was like, oh man.

445
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,910
Let's see, what else?

446
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,850
The stuff that I bought?

447
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,470
I bought a blanket that also had ghosts on it.

448
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,430
It was so cute!

449
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,870
I don't know what else I bought.

450
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,910
I saw it!

451
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,690
And I was like staring at it.

452
00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:13,690
I was like, I say it's a blanket, but it's like, it's very, um, let me see if I can find the artist's name, because it's so, it's, it kind of reminds me of like, it's like when I looked at it, I just felt this overwhelming sense of like, ah, Halloween!

453
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:14,890
And fall!

454
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,430
And it just made me so happy.

455
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,810
And so, I didn't even think, I just, I just bought it.

456
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,970
I was like, looking at it, I was like, I think I need this.

457
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,690
Um, where's the artist's name?

458
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,010
Um...

459
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,470
Oh, the artist's name is Julia Likes Cats.

460
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,310
What a good name.

461
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,510
And it's like a, it's like a, let me see, actually, you know what, maybe I can find it.

462
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,930
Julia Likes Cats.

463
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,050
Blanket.

464
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,670
I think they called it a woven tapestry.

465
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:52,890
But...

466
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,450
Oh, let me type tap, tapestry.

467
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,030
Um...

468
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,410
Oh!

469
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,550
This is it, this is it!

470
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,870
I found it, I found it, I found it.

471
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,270
Hold on, it's loading.

472
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,500
No, Instagram please.

473
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,960
Uh, oh no, I don't have Instagram.

474
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:14,720
No!

475
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,000
Oh!

476
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,440
Oh, oh, oh.

477
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,160
No, I can't look at the picture unless I have Instagram.

478
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,140
Uh...

479
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,420
Okay, it's gonna be like the worst, most blurry picture ever, but...

480
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,260
This is what it looks like.

481
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,480
Oh my god, it's even worse than I thought.

482
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,940
Look how cute this is!

483
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,620
I just saw it and I was like, this is so...

484
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,240
It's just so nice.

485
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,540
It's so, like, fall and...

486
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,060
Everything.

487
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,900
Isn't it cool?

488
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,500
It's not a bad photo.

489
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,360
It's kinda bad.

490
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,180
It's a little bad.

491
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,260
Yeah.

492
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,740
It's so cute.

493
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,840
So.

494
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,480
Mmm.

495
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,180
Posts app size.

496
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,280
Yeah, I saw, I got that.

497
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,920
Um...

498
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,840
I got some doujinshi.

499
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,640
Um...

500
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,460
I was like looking through some old doujinshi.

501
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,600
Some places had, like, newer ones.

502
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,860
I got one from Kawori because I really like that artist.

503
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,460
Um...

504
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,740
And I got...

505
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,820
Of course, I got Ayami doujinshi, the newer ones that I hadn't gotten yet.

506
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,240
Um...

507
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,480
Ayami sensei.

508
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,160
And, um...

509
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,680
I...

510
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,520
Oh, I was looking through some older ones.

511
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,580
And I found, like, an old catalog of, like...

512
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,920
Um...

513
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,780
From melon books.

514
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,440
That had, like, a bunch of...

515
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,840
Like, they have, like, paseri in there.

516
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,980
But I barely even recognize it as paseri art.

517
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,500
It's like...

518
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,700
I was like, wow, this is like a real time capsule.

519
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,040
And I also had an older doujinshi of another artist I like.

520
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,540
Uh, Kujo Ichisou.

521
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,620
So I got that.

522
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,760
And, um...

523
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,280
I...

524
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,740
There wasn't much blue archive.

525
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,320
I got a...

526
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,440
I got a little bit of blue archive.

527
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,660
Oh!

528
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,160
There is a Metal Gear print.

529
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,840
I got that.

530
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,440
And, um...

531
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:18,980
Hmm...

532
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,930
I think that's about it.

533
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,670
Oh my gosh!

534
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,390
Someone though...

535
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,190
Someone gave something to give...

536
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,390
Someone gave something to Ayami-sensei.

537
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,090
To give to me.

538
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,470
Which I was like...

539
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,050
Huh?

540
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,510
I was so shocked.

541
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,510
Because...

542
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,350
I was like...

543
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,070
No one will have anything...

544
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,130
Well, first of all, I didn't expect presents at all.

545
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,950
I didn't expect presents at all.

546
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,950
But also...

547
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,510
I...

548
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,550
Thought that...

549
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,130
There wouldn't be anything because...

550
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,370
Because...

551
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,050
You know...

552
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,710
I was a surprise guest at the panel.

553
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,130
No one even knew I was there.

554
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,750
But...

555
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,330
Um...

556
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,590
Someone...

557
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,050
Someone gave her...

558
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,510
A signed...

559
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,530
Poster of...

560
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,370
A signed Metal Gear poster.

561
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,150
Signed by Hideo Kojima.

562
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,170
To give to me.

563
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,570
I was so shocked.

564
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,670
And it had like a nice little note that was like...

565
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,350
Dear Mint...

566
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,010
This has been sitting in my...

567
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,070
In my...

568
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,530
In my...

569
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,690
What's the word?

570
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,010
In my closet for a long time.

571
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,610
I want you to use it and appreciate it.

572
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,010
Or like display it.

573
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:32,910
I

574
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,680
felt so bad though.

575
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,040
I was like...

576
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,080
I was like...

577
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,500
Oh my god.

578
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,120
Um...

579
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,560
I felt...

580
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,480
Bad that...

581
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,000
They gave it to Ayami Sensei.

582
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,320
Because I was like...

583
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,500
Ah!

584
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,140
Ah!

585
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,680
You should be giving gifts to her.

586
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,320
Not to me!

587
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,120
I wasn't even a guest.

588
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,520
So...

589
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,260
That's so cute.

590
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,920
It was really nice though.

591
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,460
Yeah.

592
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,640
It was a lot of fun.

593
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,560
And the panel was really funny.

594
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,120
Um...

595
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,500
Overall I had a good time.

596
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,040
Uh...

597
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,780
The last time I went to Anime Central...

598
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,700
I have been before.

599
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,480
The last time was...

600
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,480
Many years ago.

601
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,820
So...

602
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,140
I don't know.

603
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,340
Um...

604
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,580
But I've always liked the convention.

605
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,720
Itself.

606
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,640
And uh...

607
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,240
Unfortunately I didn't get any autographs.

608
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,780
So...

609
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,500
I...

610
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,020
Um...

611
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,080
Yeah.

612
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,640
I guess you were Ayami's guest.

613
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,120
Maybe.

614
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,760
I'm surprised they had it ready.

615
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,240
Me too!

616
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,380
Me...

617
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,140
Actually though.

618
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,640
I was so shocked.

619
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,320
And...

620
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,300
Many years ago.

621
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,840
Wow!

622
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,300
Old!

623
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,140
That was years ago.

624
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,060
Um...

625
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,740
Oh my gosh.

626
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,100
One of my favorite memories...

627
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,660
From...

628
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,860
From...

629
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,840
Anime Central...

630
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,360
Is...

631
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,800
Uh...

632
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,700
If you don't know...

633
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,980
The convention is very close to...

634
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,980
An airport.

635
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,360
Oh my gosh!

636
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,920
Senpai!

637
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,540
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

638
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,320
Thank you!

639
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,360
Thank you so much!

640
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:11,660
Thank you!

641
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:11,900
Thank you!

642
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,280
Thank you!

643
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,180
Thank you so much!

644
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,880
Oh my gosh.

645
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,200
Mmm...

646
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,280
Ohare.

647
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,040
Ohare.

648
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,410
Yes.

649
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,500
Ohare.

650
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,300
Yeah.

651
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,560
It's very close to the airport.

652
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,060
And so...

653
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
Um...

654
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,060
When I...

655
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,560
Went...

656
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,020
It might have been the last time I went.

657
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,340
But...

658
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,220
Um...

659
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,240
The...

660
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,880
Artist...

661
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,480
Main...

662
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
The singer...

663
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:33,900
Main...

664
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,320
Was there.

665
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,780
And she's the...

666
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,660
She's like the...

667
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,060
Voice of...

668
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,740
Cheryl...

669
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,300
In...

670
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,020
In...

671
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,580
In...

672
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,400
Macross Frontier.

673
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,600
But she also was like a...

674
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,400
Really...

675
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,020
Big...

676
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,820
Annie Song singer as well.

677
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,620
And so...

678
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,280
I remember...

679
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,180
I remember...

680
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,520
I remember...

681
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,140
I remember...

682
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,420
In the concert...

683
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,360
She was singing Diamond Crevice.

684
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,240
Which is the like...

685
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,720
Kamisomani...

686
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,440
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba...

687
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,940
That song from Macross.

688
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,660
And as she was singing it...

689
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,380
And like...

690
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,260
In...

691
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,880
In the...

692
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,720
It was like...

693
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,060
The sun was setting.

694
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,800
And so...

695
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,380
It was really beautiful out.

696
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:14,840
And it was like...

697
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,440
Really sunny.

698
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,620
And the sun was setting.

699
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,980
So the sky was kind of pink.

700
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,160
And then...

701
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,520
Behind her...

702
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,720
There was like an airplane flying...

703
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,140
At that moment.

704
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,060
As she was singing it.

705
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,560
And so...

706
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:26,900
Like...

707
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,640
I was like...

708
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,020
Oh my gosh.

709
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,640
In my brain...

710
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:28,940
I was like...

711
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,140
This...

712
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,600
This is...

713
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,740
This is Macross.

714
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,160
This is so...

715
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,760
What?

716
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,720
And I just remember my brain...

717
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,460
That whole time...

718
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:35,660
Like...

719
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,380
I felt like I was ascending...

720
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,740
Into another dimension.

721
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,580
I was like...

722
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,000
This is the coolest moment.

723
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,360
I don't think I could ever...

724
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,980
Experience a moment cooler than this.

725
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:45,780
Ever.

726
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,200
It's one of those life moments.

727
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,300
I still think about it.

728
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,040
To this very day.

729
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,500
And because of that...

730
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,880
Because of that one moment...

731
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,120
Anime Central is one of my favorite...

732
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,160
One of my favorite conventions.

733
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,380
So...

734
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,940
When Ayami Sensei told me that she was gonna go...

735
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,520
When she told me that she was gonna be there...

736
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,320
She told me...

737
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,160
Quite some time ago.

738
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,500
So I was just like...

739
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:07,820
I...

740
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,200
I will go just for you!

741
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,060
And that was before they announced some of their other guests this year.

742
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:13,820
Which was like...

743
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,440
Soramaru!

744
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,100
The voice of...

745
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,180
Of...

746
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,060
Of...

747
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,040
Niko Yazawa.

748
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,300
From Love Live.

749
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,100
And also...

750
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:24,920
Gatsu!

751
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,060
Oh my gosh!

752
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,080
Thank you for the 50.

753
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,900
We have moved to a death transcendence.

754
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,900
It's true.

755
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:34,660
Gatsu!

756
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,980
Thank you so much for the 50 gift and thank you!

757
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,200
So bad, thank you for that.

758
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,900
Another 50?

759
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,480
Thank you!

760
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,560
Thank you!

761
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,600
Thank you so much.

762
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,720
Larry!

763
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,400
Welcome to membership.

764
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,120
Thank you, thank you.

765
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,340
Sally and Maki too.

766
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:52,620
Yeah!

767
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,080
I actually didn't get to see it.

768
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,160
I'm so sad.

769
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:04,940
My schedule always overlapped with her, but I'll play next convention.

770
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,720
Going to my first anime con this weekend!

771
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,280
Wish me luck!

772
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,600
Good luck!

773
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,580
Oh my gosh!

774
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,680
But yeah, so it was just like... it was so fun.

775
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,540
I went to all the seiyuu panels and everything.

776
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:28,760
So even before... even before I knew that they were going to be invited...

777
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,620
I was going already for Ayami, so I felt really like, oh my gosh, this is crazy.

778
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,960
What's your policy for gifts at Ofukai?

779
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,520
That's a great question.

780
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,440
Thank you for asking.

781
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,400
Anything but food is okay.

782
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,360
Okay.

783
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,020
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Anything but food.

785
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,540
Well, that's at least what it said on the site.

786
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,120
I honestly don't mind snacks if they're wrapped.

787
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,600
But no handmade food or anything like that.

788
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,620
Asa was my first con.

789
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,060
I went to meet Ayasuzaki and got her to sign my Nitta Minami CD.

790
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:16,860
Oh my god!

791
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,620
I had a lot of fun even though I went alone.

792
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,240
Yeah, sometimes things like that are so fun, even alone.

793
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,460
Oh my god, this is so bad.

794
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,460
Thank you for one month...

795
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:25,820
GIFT!

796
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,680
Thank you for the 50 gift!

797
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,500
Thank you!

798
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,400
Oh my gosh, thank you guys.

799
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:38,940
But...

800
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,360
But yeah...

801
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,480
So gifts are okay.

802
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,280
Which I think...

803
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,900
Um...

804
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,780
Uh...

805
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Am I allowed to say this?

806
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,240
Um...

807
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,260
Uh...

808
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:02,000
It will be like my first time receiving gifts so I'm really excited about it because...

809
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,440
Um...

810
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,220
Uh...

811
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,320
Back in heaven, there were times when people would give gifts.

812
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,840
And I...

813
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,060
Um...

814
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,880
We were told that we would receive them and I never received them.

815
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,100
And...

816
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,440
I think about it all the time because I just feel so bad about it.

817
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:19,900
How...

818
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,420
There were people that...

819
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,640
Were...

820
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,860
Were giving certain things or maybe bought something with their own money and then I just never...

821
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,540
Received the gifts so...

822
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:29,920
Um...

823
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,760
Yeah...

824
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,920
Uh...

825
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,180
I...

826
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,680
I don't know if like maybe...

827
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,480
Maybe if...

828
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,080
Maybe I'm still waiting on it.

829
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,100
I don't know but...

830
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,400
Um...

831
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,300
Uh...

832
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,200
Yeah...

833
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,760
So...

834
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,600
But...

835
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:44,960
Um...

836
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,620
Even from...

837
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,760
Previous...

838
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,180
Times to...

839
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,440
Like the...

840
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,600
I just...

841
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:50,820
Uh...

842
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,700
People would give stuff and then it would just never show up in the mail.

843
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,420
So...

844
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,340
I'm really sorry if that happened.

845
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,780
Um...

846
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,300
But...

847
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,720
So...

848
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:01,780
Uh...

849
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,320
That's...

850
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,640
Uh...

851
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,240
That's...

852
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,640
Why I'm excited this time that I will...

853
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,540
Actually...

854
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,180
Be able to...

855
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,040
Be actually...

856
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,580
Actually be able to receive...

857
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,640
Receive it.

858
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,140
So...

859
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,160
Heaven's customs are kind of crazy.

860
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,540
Heaven delivery caught lagging.

861
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,920
There was stuff too that I was really looking forward to.

862
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,200
But...

863
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,720
Um...

864
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,120
Yeah...

865
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,600
So...

866
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Thank you for the 50 gift!

867
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,320
Thank you!

868
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,360
But I'm excited for this time.

869
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:36,820
So...

870
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,800
Um...

871
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,480
I don't know if...

872
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,640
Cause I...

873
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,720
I think for the...

874
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,000
Gifts...

875
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,240
It's...

876
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,560
It's...

877
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,260
Maybe only for people that got meet and greet stuff.

878
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,140
Um...

879
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,500
I will try to see if there's a way.

880
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,100
If you wanna...

881
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,220
Yeah...

882
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,300
Not to say that you have to gift me anything or...

883
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,060
You know...

884
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,860
Anything like that.

885
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,260
But if you...

886
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,000
Um...

887
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,100
Want to gift something...

888
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,780
I will see if there's a way that you can...

889
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,300
Gift it...

890
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:02,900
Um...

891
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,080
A place to gift it...

892
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,660
Where I will be able to receive it.

893
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,680
Hmm...

894
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,660
Did you ever receive your letters?

895
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,680
I did receive those!

896
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,800
Yes, yes.

897
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,320
I did receive those.

898
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,460
So...

899
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,520
That's why...

900
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,540
That's why...

901
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,880
I thought it was strange that I...

902
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,620
Never got the gifts...

903
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,640
As well.

904
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,080
I thought it was strange that...

905
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,380
They just didn't include it.

906
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,760
And I don't know...

907
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,340
Maybe if it was like a lack of communication or...

908
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,640
If some...

909
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,820
One side...

910
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,700
You know...

911
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,980
If some place sent it and then...

912
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,520
Whoever received it...

913
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,440
Then...

914
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,200
Didn't send it...

915
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,100
Or if the...

916
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,940
The...

917
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,280
First place...

918
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,880
Didn't send it...

919
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,300
I don't know!

920
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,320
I don't know where...

921
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
The lack of communication...

922
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:44,520
And then...

923
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,140
Is happening...

924
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,580
I don't know...

925
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,920
I don't have any contact anymore...

926
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,180
So...

927
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:47,920
Uh...

928
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,660
Yeah...

929
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,800
Yeah...

930
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,980
I just think it's...

931
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,000
Kind of crummy if...

932
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,340
They say...

933
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,280
Gifts are allowed...

934
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,160
And people give gifts...

935
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,500
And then...

936
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:55,840
You know...

937
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,800
But anyway...

938
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,160
Ready to wave light sticks for you on Anime North!

939
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,440
Thank you!

940
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,480
Thank you!

941
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:02,700
Thank you!

942
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,020
I guess...

943
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,680
I guess now we know we can gift.

944
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,200
Yeah!

945
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,680
If you want...

946
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,160
If you want to...

947
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,960
You don't have to though.

948
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,080
Please don't feel like you have to.

949
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,140
Or if...

950
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,100
But even if you just like...

951
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,520
Want to write a letter...

952
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,320
Or something too...

953
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,120
That's okay too!

954
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,640
Yeah!

955
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,800
What's with the guy in the back?

956
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,080
He's having a barbecue!

957
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,060
With Snake!

958
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:21,900
It's Otacon!

959
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,600
I guess...

960
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,680
Looking at it here...

961
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,460
Otacon just looks like a random guy...

962
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,880
He needs his lab coat...

963
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,220
He's...

964
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,420
He's casual Friday right now...

965
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,020
Time to write a letter...

966
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,660
Why do you have a...

967
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,140
Why do you look so evil...

968
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,300
When you say that...

969
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,000
Label!

970
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,740
It's lizard!

971
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,920
Lizard!

972
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,240
Thank you for what?

973
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,540
The gift!

974
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:56,880
Gifted!

975
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,360
Thank you!

976
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,500
Excited and nervous to meet you at Off-Guy!

977
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,360
Delivered!

978
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,360
Why did you get a...

979
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,060
Did you get a meet and greet?

980
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,660
Yippee!

981
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,960
Thank you!

982
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,510
Lollipop, welcome to membership!

983
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,370
Thank you!

984
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,550
But yeah, there's been a lot of things...

985
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,930
I'm sorry that I'm kind of like...

986
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,790
Low energy today...

987
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,230
Because...

988
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,590
The weekend was so much...

989
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,510
And then...

990
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,170
I don't know...

991
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,810
The weekend was so much...

992
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,290
And then...

993
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,210
I came back and I was like...

994
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,710
I haven't thought of my schedule at all...

995
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,050
I should have...

996
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,550
I should have pre-planned...

997
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,530
I should have planned my schedule for this week...

998
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,350
So I'm sorry I don't have a schedule up yet...

999
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,870
And also...

1000
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,670
Um...

1001
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,070
I...

1002
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:56,610
Uh...

1003
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,570
I...

1004
00:37:59,250 --> 00:37:59,970
What's the word?

1005
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,310
Um...

1006
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,470
Uh...

1007
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,490
Uh...

1008
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,150
I can't...

1009
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,910
My wallet is still recovering from Japan two months ago, even...

1010
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,450
So even though I've been meaning to do ASIN, I couldn't afford it.

1011
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:19,110
I think you'd really like it a lot, GhostDucker.

1012
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,550
Maybe you could never go.

1013
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,090
I didn't want to meet in green, unfortunately, but if you see a...

1014
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,590
Zagreus cosplay with kazoos in his server school's mouth...

1015
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,950
He has a gift for you.

1016
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,830
Thank you!

1017
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:38,010
Just finishing your podcast with Natara while cleaning my restaurant!

1018
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,790
Oh my goodness, it's amazing!

1019
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:40,650
You kept me waiting!

1020
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,270
I hear a super chat!

1021
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,150
Hope your Monday is going well.

1022
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:46,350
Yeah!

1023
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,630
Brain loading... yeah!

1024
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,190
It was... just a really busy weekend.

1025
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,130
And... oh!

1026
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
No, I don't remember.

1027
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,760
But yeah, sorry about... low energies because I'm just so sleepy.

1028
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,280
But...

1029
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:21,570
KC!

1030
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:22,510
Welcome to membership!

1031
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,330
Big ham!

1032
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:23,970
Welcome back!

1033
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,250
Happy to be here!

1034
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,670
Otacene for life!

1035
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,590
Yeah!

1036
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,250
There they are.

1037
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,210
My little guys hanging out.

1038
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:35,410
Actually, I have them labeled as...

1039
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,950
TheBoys.png

1040
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,650
TheBoys.png We're chilling.

1041
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,430
But!

1042
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,370
We're not just chilling, you guys.

1043
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,290
We're not just chilling.

1044
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,390
We're not just chilling.

1045
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,190
Because...

1046
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,770
There's something else.

1047
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,330
Alex Mateo!

1048
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:01,910
Welcome back!

1049
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:02,490
Thank you!

1050
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,430
Mateo, thank you for one month too!

1051
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:04,970
Thank you!

1052
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,030
Media Post Con, life to be bleh.

1053
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,040
I think it's just...

1054
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,350
I feel...

1055
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,810
It's really weird because...

1056
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,450
This...

1057
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,020
This ASEN in particular because...

1058
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,210
Because I didn't win any of the autographs.

1059
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,890
And also, usually I...

1060
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,310
I go for seiyuu.

1061
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,930
But I really love going for concerts.

1062
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,630
And so...

1063
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,610
The fact that...

1064
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,650
They didn't really have like a concert that I was...

1065
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,510
Super interested in so I didn't get to...

1066
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,110
So I didn't go.

1067
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:34,950
But I still...

1068
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:46,010
And I was just kind of like, I'm just kind of like, like, I feel not unfulfilled, but I feel like I did so much and so little at the same time.

1069
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:46,470
You know what I mean?

1070
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,590
Sir Simplot, thanks for your help.

1071
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,670
Sally didn't win any meet and greets, but I'll be here.

1072
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,190
There are Ofkai hanging out and buying all the merch of my Oshis that I can find.

1073
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,010
Your wallet, no.

1074
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,410
If we can gift without winning, I have something too.

1075
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,450
Thanks for being amazing, Vitto.

1076
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,510
Thanks, Miss Miss.

1077
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,390
Thank you.

1078
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,150
Shadow Demon Lord, thank you for the gift.

1079
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,550
I have something that we can do.

1080
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,110
I have something that we can do, you guys.

1081
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,370
While we chill and while we talk.

1082
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,290
Is it okay if we just talk today?

1083
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,050
My brain is really slow.

1084
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,110
I can barely keep my eyes open.

1085
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,970
I'm so sleepy.

1086
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,390
Is it bloons?

1087
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:35,670
No.

1088
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,550
No.

1089
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,030
I wasn't sure if you answered this before, but are you okay with people cosplaying as you?

1090
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,510
Of course!

1091
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,650
If you want to!

1092
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,890
I'm honored if you want to cosplay me.

1093
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:49,350
Oh my gosh.

1094
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,130
Good morning, me.

1095
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,250
Good morning!

1096
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,870
Good...

1097
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,170
Oh.

1098
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:55,790
Good morning.

1099
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,310
Sorry, Glen German.

1100
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,190
Good morning.

1101
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,590
Minto time.

1102
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,610
Are you guys ready?

1103
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,270
Shoo.

1104
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:08,770
Oh.

1105
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,330
Oh yeah!

1106
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:10,690
Hahaha!

1107
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:11,950
Oh!

1108
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,980
Hold on, let me refresh it.

1109
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,300
Hahaha!

1110
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,360
We're watching fish!

1111
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,320
Which one should we watch?

1112
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,100
I'm actually really interested in live spider cam.

1113
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh sorry.

1114
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,500
Spider crab cam.

1115
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,120
Let's see.

1116
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,000
Let's check it out.

1117
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,680
Oh!

1118
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,300
There's music!

1119
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,600
Wow!

1120
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,060
Oh my god!

1121
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:46,960
Wow!

1122
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,760
Oh my god!

1123
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,640
This is so...

1124
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,740
This is so spooky.

1125
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,260
Look at the size of that crab!

1126
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,660
Why is it so spooky looking?

1127
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,440
Why is their webcam... or their livestream not working?

1128
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,000
No!

1129
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,840
No!

1130
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,180
Okay, I guess we'll go to another one.

1131
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,520
Let's try...

1132
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,800
Let's try the live Monterey Baycam.

1133
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,960
Oh wait, you guys can't see it.

1134
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,460
Sorry, it's cut off a little bit.

1135
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,020
Let's try this one.

1136
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,040
Oh my god!

1137
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,900
There's so many birds!

1138
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,700
Oh my god!

1139
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,020
We have a visitor!

1140
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,820
We have a new friend!

1141
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,940
Sea otter?

1142
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,020
Okay, we'll check them all out.

1143
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,160
That's a big guy right there.

1144
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:39,720
Is that a goose?

1145
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,060
Talk to me, goose.

1146
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,500
Sorry!

1147
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,620
I just felt like a whiplash.

1148
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,240
Like I got slapped or something.

1149
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,220
Yo, what just happened?

1150
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,960
Oh my god!

1151
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,420
I thought this was supposed to be chill.

1152
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:04,980
Me too!

1153
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,920
Look how cute they are.

1154
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,460
Oh, they're jumping around.

1155
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,700
See ya!

1156
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,320
See ya, loser!

1157
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,180
See ya!

1158
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,440
See ya, you're not allowed on this little rock formation either, anyway.

1159
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,820
Oh wow!

1160
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,720
Wait, does it move around?

1161
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh my gosh, I feel so at peace right now.

1162
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,520
If you don't know...

1163
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,120
Oh my gosh, Dan!

1164
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,380
Thank you for the birthday gift!

1165
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,480
Thank you so much!

1166
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,840
If you didn't know...

1167
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,400
Before I graduated many, many years ago...

1168
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,120
I...

1169
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,500
I used to watch the aquarium live cams...

1170
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,060
My favorite streams are Meat Zatsu's.

1171
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,440
Let's go!

1172
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,860
I used to watch these.

1173
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,940
Just kind of hanging out.

1174
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,220
Three years ago.

1175
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,020
Many, many years ago.

1176
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,370
The waves are so nice.

1177
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,290
I know, I feel really relaxed watching this.

1178
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:12,210
Let's go see... Some people said they want to see Otter Cam.

1179
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,030
It's just little guys!

1180
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,290
Oh!

1181
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:29,010
They're spinning and twirling and swimming around.

1182
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,570
I wish I chilled with you all sooner.

1183
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,330
No, you're here now!

1184
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,430
We're chilling.

1185
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,090
What are you talking about?

1186
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,730
You're here now.

1187
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,150
He's so slick.

1188
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:44,750
Oh my goodness.

1189
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,810
Oh, he's looking at me.

1190
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,270
That's me.

1191
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,870
He's looking at me.

1192
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:51,550
Welcome

1193
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:00,780
back!

1194
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,560
Oh, there he is.

1195
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,080
Yeah.

1196
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,400
Wow, there's so many people watching this one.

1197
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,560
Two hundred people are watching this one.

1198
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,200
Wow.

1199
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,380
Hey, Aminto.

1200
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,740
Hey, Doppo.

1201
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:17,600
Thank you for a month.

1202
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,180
Thank you.

1203
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,520
That was so baby.

1204
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,300
There's three!

1205
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,220
I hope they're having an enriched life.

1206
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,240
Will you be watching them?

1207
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:35,700
Yeah.

1208
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:42,200
So we just can watch and talk and just kinda hang out and, uh, you know.

1209
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,410
Of course, if you want to, these are live cams.

1210
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,120
They're basically 24-7.

1211
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,440
If you ever want to watch.

1212
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,220
It's the Monterey... the Monterey...

1213
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,200
Monterey Bay Aquarium.

1214
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,100
I keep getting these shorts of people that seem to have pet river otters.

1215
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:09,600
Pets?

1216
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,440
I don't know about that.

1217
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,700
I don't know about that.

1218
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,660
I kind of want to see the penguins though.

1219
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,020
Is that okay?

1220
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,580
African penguin cam.

1221
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,520
Ta-da!

1222
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:28,840
Eww!

1223
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,180
Oh god!

1224
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,300
It's disgusting!

1225
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,260
Oh my god, exactly what I...

1226
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,140
Oh god, imagine the smell in there.

1227
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,860
I can imagine the smell.

1228
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,220
Oh gosh, it's nasty.

1229
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,900
The rocks are stinking.

1230
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,440
Do not imagine the smell.

1231
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,000
Look at that...

1232
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,480
Is that a penguin right there?

1233
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,340
I can't tell.

1234
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,900
Or is that a rock?

1235
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,480
I don't think it's a penguin.

1236
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,240
Oh, I imagine the smell.

1237
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:21,620
Yeah!

1238
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,720
Let's go!

1239
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,080
He did it!

1240
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,840
He jumped off!

1241
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,820
Did you see his little feet go...

1242
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,600
tap tap tap tap.

1243
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,380
Have you seen the live cams?

1244
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,300
The what?

1245
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,120
The what what live cams?

1246
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,720
Here we see a group of poopy penguins.

1247
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,800
Benny cabbage pie.

1248
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,600
My cat just pissed on me!

1249
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,820
Can I have some words of comfort in these trying times?

1250
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,420
I'm really sorry Shin-chan.

1251
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,760
You know they say sometimes...

1252
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,560
Oh my god!

1253
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,540
Is this guy...

1254
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,380
I thought he was using the restroom.

1255
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,620
You know some say that when you get when you get peed on by something it's good luck, right?

1256
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,200
So...

1257
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,320
Or is that pooped on?

1258
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,520
Is it...

1259
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:34,890
I don't know.

1260
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:36,650
Who says that?

1261
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,730
I don't think anybody says that.

1262
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:39,750
Oh my god.

1263
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,370
Oh it's...

1264
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:43,430
bird poop!

1265
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,090
My cat threw up in his litter box which actually rules.

1266
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,450
I wish he would do that instead of the poop.

1267
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,390
Everything about house vtubers are basically zoo animals.

1268
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:04,550
We watch them frolic and play and occasionally throw peanut super chats into their enclosures.

1269
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,670
It was funny after the the panel with Ayami-sensei

1270
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,750
Her manager...

1271
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,210
Ayami-sensei was like turn around my manager wanted to say something to you.

1272
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,150
I was like oh okay.

1273
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:22,730
Yes sir?

1274
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:32,450
And he just like starts making like like he's like throwing a a baseball with both hands he like keeps throwing he's just like super chat, super chat, super chat, super chat Super chat

1275
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,710
She was so silly.

1276
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,070
She was so... oh let's look at the short cam.

1277
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,260
Oh my god that's a big fish.

1278
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,880
He just came up from nowhere.

1279
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,600
Super chat.

1280
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,440
No!

1281
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,780
Damn it it's my birthday today and I'm dropping by to say hello.

1282
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,300
Lei happy birthday!

1283
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,120
I haven't been able to catch up with your streams.

1284
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:05,940
Have a nice day.

1285
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,800
Thank you!

1286
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,640

1287
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,080

Happy birthday to you!

1290

Happy birthday to you!

1291
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,500

1295
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,420
This is a super chat that allows you to react.

1296
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,480
Super chat is baha blast color.

1297
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:38,800
Super Chat is baha blast color.

1298
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,360
She really liked the baha blast.

1299
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:41,740
SuperChat.

1300
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,520
Super Chat, oh gosh!

1301
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,840
Thank you guys for the super chat.

Thank you for the peak!

1303
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,100
Wow, he's so big!

1304
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,960
Wow, where these guys come from?

1305
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,300
Wow, how is it...

1306
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,080
eat, eat

1307
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,540
Wow, wow!

1308
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:58,640
Wow!

1309
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,160
I like how many different types of sharks are in here.

1310
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,000
Okay,

1311
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:11,400
good.

1312
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:11,840
We have time.

1313
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,060
Thank you!

1314
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,560
Yeah, we're just chilling and talking and...

1315
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,780
I don't really...

1316
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,700
I'm trying to think of, you know, what else.

1317
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,480
Oh my gosh, you can see the people walking by.

1318
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,620
It's kind of creepy.

1319
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,180
Now I'm watching the people.

1320
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,360
Now they're in the zoo.

1321
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,040
I want to eat sushi.

1322
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:54,780
No!

1323
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:01,790
Soul SS!

1324
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,270
Thank you for the five gifted!

1325
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:04,150
Thank you!

1326
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,070
Soulsssssssss...

1327
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:07,550
Wow!

1328
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:08,730
Oh my god!

1329
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:09,930
Did you guys see that?

1330
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,830
He just did a...

1331
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,330
That guy just did a flip!

1332
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,550
That guy just did a flip!

1333
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,000
Hiyo, what's your favorite ice cream flavor?

1334
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,220
I like cookies and cream.

1335
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:31,520
I like ice cream.

1336
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,640
Do a barrel roll.

1337
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,740
Do a barrel roll.

1338
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,860
What else do we have?

1339
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,200
What else do we have going on?

1340
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,800
Oh, let's see aviary cam.

1341
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,580
Oh, they're so cute!

1342
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,480
Oh, you can see the ocean from here too.

1343
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,120
Look at that tiny little bird.

1344
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,400
Look at that tiny little bird.

1345
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,040
Oh my gosh.

1346
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,680
This morning, my cat, Paz, she was looking out the window.

1347
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,300
She loves looking out the window.

1348
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,700
It's like her favorite activity to do.

1349
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,060
It's her enrichment time.

1350
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,560
Looking out the window and, you know, observing the world.

1351
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,400
She saw, she saw, today she saw a lizard and she stood up.

1352
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,540
Sorry!

1353
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,280
Oh god, they were really close.

1354
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,540
Oh my gosh, their beaks are kind of bent.

1355
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,980
They have such interesting form.

1356
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,560
God, they're huge.

1357
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,760
They're really big birds.

1358
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:44,900
But...

1359
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:54,100
Today, in the tree, I saw the fattest bird I think I've ever seen in my entire life.

1360
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,460
This guy was so...

1361
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,280
fat.

1362
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,440
This guy was just...

1363
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,420
a real...

1364
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,700
Wow, he's amazing!

1365
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,720
Oh no!

1366
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,000
Oh my god, it's so cute!

1367
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,660
Look at him go!

1368
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,600
No, cameraman, stop the camera!

1369
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,960
No, cameraman, stop the camera!

1370
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,260
Stop the camera!

1371
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,200
Look at him go!

1372
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,100
Oh, thank god!

1373
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:27,760
Oh my god.

1374
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,160
Oh, he's so cute!

1375
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,420
He just won't stop!

1376
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,580
Oh, he stopped.

1377
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,940
Oh gosh, thank god.

1378
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,180
He was starting to cry.

1379
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,260
So cute.

1380
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,380
Do it.

1381
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,560
Do it, big bird, do it.

1382
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,600
Oh, you jerk.

1383
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,260
Oh, man.

1384
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,140
Oh, yes!

1385
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,260
Yes, yes, go back in.

1386
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,980
Oh man, he scurried away.

1387
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,380
He drank his bathwater.

1388
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:03,580
Wouldn't you?

1389
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,480
If I saw something that cute, I'd drink its bathwater too.

1390
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,940
I'd be like, I need to consume some of that cuteness.

1391
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,340
I need it.

1392
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,660
Your boy, Steven Adams!

1393
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,080
Thank you for the rose.

1394
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:20,740
Thank you.

1395
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,060
It was super cool to see you with Ayami tasting snacks in Chicago.

1396
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:29,060
I hope Ayami passed along a little gift airway.

1397
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:29,500
Yes!

1398
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,080
She did.

1399
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:32,340
She did.

1400
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,480
Hey, cameraman.

1401
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,440
There's nothing here.

1402
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,920
Cameraman, show us the goods.

1403
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,300
Show us the birds.

1404
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,340
I'm in chill stream.

1405
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:45,920
Awesome, man.

1406
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,900
Ah, grain of sand.

1407
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,180
What are you talking about?

1408
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,400
I'm not excited about the sand.

1409
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,400
I'm excited about the birds.

1410
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,800
Oh boy, sand.

1411
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,060
Where are they?

1412
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,200
Where's the birds?

1413
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:13,550
I think they're all dead.

1414
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:17,870
Sometimes

1415
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,100
I think about the world ended.

1416
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,200
He's going around in circles.

1417
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,960
Look how cute his little tippy tops are.

1418
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,020
Tippy top top top.

1419
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,440
Come over here, bird.

1420
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,000
Come over here, bird.

1421
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,280
Is it possible to deliver you a letter at a virtual vacation concert?

1422
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,340
That, I don't know yet.

1423
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,920
I can look into that, though.

1424
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,740
I can look into that.

1425
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,080
There they are!

1426
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,380
The birds are back!

1427
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,320
The birds are back in town!

1428
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,460
Back in town!

1429
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,620
The birds are back in town!

1430
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,020
That guy was like a ghost signing.

1431
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,560
Did Streamlabs' donor alerts break?

1432
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,640
I think they're very delayed because of...

1433
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,760
Because of the gifted.

1434
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,740
I'm sorry.

1435
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,800
They'll show up eventually, though.

1436
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,860
I'm sure they will.

1437
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:26,800
Eventually.

1438
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,080
Oh, I see that some have been donated.

1439
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,380
I'm sorry.

1440
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,780
More bath water!

1441
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,660
Oh, he's swimming!

1442
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,720
Oh, he's so cute!

1443
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,140
This one kind of sucks.

1444
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:48,580
Okay.

1445
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,440
Let's check out the kelp forest.

1446
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,720
That's a lot of fish up there!

1447
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:11,000
I typically like the ones where I don't see the walls.

1448
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,780
Also, the way the kelp moves is really...

1449
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,680
Wow.

1450
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:36,350
At 28 feet, the kelp forest is one of the tallest aquarium exhibits in the world!

1451
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,070
Wow!

1452
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,790
Oh my god!

1453
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,130
Does that have to be so aggressive?

1454
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:47,490
Why was it like that?

1455
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:49,370
Oh my god!

1456
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,450
What just happened?

1457
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,430
I got scared.

1458
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:54,270
Me too!

1459
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,630
What is up with this camera?

1460
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,000
I feel so calm with the way the kelp moves.

1461
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,540
Oh my god, that's an ugly fish down there in the corner.

1462
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:26,900
They're so ugly.

1463
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,560
That guy's ugly too.

1464
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,100
That guy's cool.

1465
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:31,660
I like him.

1466
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,740
That guy's cool.

1467
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,620
I like how he goes...

1468
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,760
Fish shaming?

1469
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,040
Whoa!

1470
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,220
All the fish are coming out!

1471
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,360
They're all coming out.

1472
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,540
There's so many fish in here.

1473
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,420
I want to see the school though.

1474
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,480
Hey cameraman, can I please...

1475
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:50,860
Wow!

1476
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:53,680
He's huge!

1477
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,180
Is that a parrot?

1478
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,860
Fish, maybe?

1479
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:58,420
Okay.

1480
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,040
Wowee.

1481
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,320
Goodness gracious.

1482
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,240
Big boy fish.

1483
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,420
Boss fish.

1484
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,740
Bro was built like candy corn.

1485
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,540
Oh, there's sharks in here too.

1486
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,800
Thank you, Mr. Cameraman.

1487
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,560
Hey Mint.

1488
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,320
Did you know that recently scientists have discovered a super terrifying plant?

1489
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,400
Its name sends shivers down my spine.

1490
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,600
They call it...

1491
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:49,880
Bamboo!

1492
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,480
Bamboo!

1493
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,060
Terrifying.

1494
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,800
Ever seen the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta?

1495
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,020
Oh god, sorry.

1496
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,300
They have actual whale sharks and...

1497
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:06,620
Manta rays!

1498
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,240
Wait, manta rays are the really, really, really, really...

1499
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,280
I know whale sharks, but manta rays are the really, really big ones, right?

1500
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,160
You know what I like to do?

1501
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,820
I like to go to the stingrays.

1502
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:19,780
And I like to...

1503
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,560
You know how some aquariums have the...

1504
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,940
Georgia Aquarium is amazing?

1505
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,240
I wanna go!

1506
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,500
Been there a few times in the past.

1507
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,280
I wanna see a whale shark.

1508
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,400
I wanna see...

1509
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,640
I want to jump in here and shove a fistful of seaweed into my mouth.

1510
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,940
Might be a little salty, I know.

1511
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,480
Good night, Minto.

1512
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,600
It was fun catching your stream.

1513
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,420
Thanks, Damien.

1514
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,000
Have a good night.

1515
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,800
I like to...

1516
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,680
The touch...

1517
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,560
The touch stingrays.

1518
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,700
I like to put my hands underneath them.

1519
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,600
And have them nibble on my fingers.

1520
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,520
...

1521
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,780
It's a good experience.

1522
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,750
This one feels like a screensaver.

1523
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,730
This one doesn't even feel real.

1524
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:21,890
...

1525
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:24,130
What are you eating?

1526
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,630
Reese's Puffs.

1527
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:26,310
...

1528
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:29,970
Thank you Luke!

1529
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:30,650
Thank you!

1530
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:31,730
...

1531
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:38,210
Wow.

1532
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,090
I feel

1533
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:55,050
like I need some more ethereal kind of music instead.

1534
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:01,030
I love Mint as my GF and she has Boing Boing.

1535
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,180
Are you okay?

1536
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:28,940
Uh oh.

1537
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:32,810
Get some help.

1538
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,230
It's okay.

1539
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:43,810
It's okay.

1540
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:45,270
Jellyfish, that's done.

1541
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:46,710
Yeah, basically.

1542
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,010
Mint is with Ayami now.

1543
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:06,850
Let her go.

1544
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:14,230
There's the jellyfish music anime this season.

1545
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:14,730
Oh yes!

1546
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:16,630
I have heard about it.

1547
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,030
I don't know anything about it though.

1548
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,710
What is the...

1549
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:23,610
What is it about?

1550
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:27,310
There's a few shows that I've been wanting to watch this season.

1551
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:29,990
That reminds me.

1552
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,270
I have to watch Blue Archive.

1553
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,630
Um...

1554
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:38,150
I've seen this jellyfish stream for 50 billion hours.

1555
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:38,850
It's my favorite.

1556
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,170
I'm somewhat of an avid diver.

1557
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:47,750
My most favorite moments are when I'm under and I get to see all kinds of sea life.

1558
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:51,970
I've seen dolphins, some small sharks, and the most memorable is the lionfish!

1559
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:53,990
Whoa, aren't those poisonous?

1560
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:56,670
Do not pee on jelly stings.

1561
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:57,650
I think you're supposed to.

1562
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,570
You're supposed to pee on jelly stings.

1563
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:06,090
If anybody in here got stung by a jellyfish, I'd pee on you.

1564
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,630
So that you wouldn't die.

1565
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:10,310
So don't worry.

1566
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,070
I got you, homie.

1567
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,030
I got you.

1568
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:22,470
I got stung, Mint!

1569
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:23,330
Help!

1570
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,150
Did you?

1571
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:31,250
Did you really?

1572
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:33,970
Thanks, I think.

1573
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,710
I would help a homie out.

1574
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,130
Minto being a bro.

1575
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:50,430
Homies would pee on each other to save them from the jellyfish stings.

1576
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,120
Ghosts can pee?

1577
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,160
Don't think about it.

1578
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,140
Too hard.

1579
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,140
Don't think about it too hard.

1580
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,900
Thanks for the gift of every core!

1581
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,220
I thought the pee wars were over.

1582
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,980
Was there ever a war?

1583
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:19,460
Planet of the apes.

1584
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:27,120
Help, I've been stu- Tuna.

1585
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,180
Tuna.

1586
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:29,980
Oh, Tuna.

1587
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,700
Oh, Tuna.

1588
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,140
Oh, Tuna.

1589
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:56,030
Mint, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1590
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:56,810
Help me out here.

1591
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,130
Spears likes the strawberry jelly?

1592
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:02,830
Do you need a tampon?

1593
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:03,690
Are you okay, mister?

1594
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,930
Why do you use the strawberry jelly?

1595
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:12,710
Do it, it's his birthday.

1596
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:15,150
Is it actually your birthday, Tuna?

1597
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,310
Strawberry jelly equals jellyfish.

1598
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,220
I don't think so.

1599
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,300
I've never...

1600
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,640
Mint, please, it's Tuna's birthday.

1601
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,680
Do it for the birthday boy.

1602
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:48,400
Stop peer pressuring me!

1603
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:48,480
What's the theme?

1604
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:55,780
Maya went to do research before you...

1605
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,740
Before I what?

1606
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,360
Oh, pounce on the next doujin.

1607
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,800
I suspect a theme is developing.

1608
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,620
No, the one...

1609
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,960
The one that I got recently was a hypno...

1610
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,140
Hypnosis one.

1611
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,740
I think I'm kind of into...

1612
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,540
Into the hypnosis recently.

1613
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,740
Don't worry, there's nothing else in it.

1614
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,660
Minto, please say my name with contemptu.

1615
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:41,820
Asni.

1616
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,340
Asni.

1617
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:50,480
Oh no.

1618
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,810
This looks good like a wallpaper.

1619
01:09:59,050 --> 01:09:59,630
I know, right?

1620
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:01,150
That's why I keep it up.

1621
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,570
Actually, recently at night...

1622
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,410
When I...

1623
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,250
Actually, hold on.

1624
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:07,150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1625
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:07,450
This is kind of...

1626
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,490
You're not gonna hear anything real quick.

1627
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:11,350
I kind of want to hear what the music they have on for this, if it's like a...

1628
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:14,210
Oh yeah, it's kind of like a...

1629
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,210
Just like that.

1630
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,030
Just like that.

1631
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:02,210
What was I saying?

1632
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,930
Oh, at night, I put on like a...

1633
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:06,630
It's like a...

1634
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,610
It's not a live stream but it's like a...

1635
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:09,790
It's like a crazy stream.

1636
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:21,890
It's a crazy like 8 hour long video or something like that and it's just of like, it's jazz and then it's like Tokyo at night and it just switches between some videos of Tokyo at night.

1637
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:23,470
Akabane!

1638
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:24,130
Welcome to membership!

1639
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:24,930
That's my face!

1640
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,590
What are you trying to summon, Minto?

1641
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,600
Oh,

1642
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:44,670
a snack.

1643
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:51,410
And one day Matara offers to walk on us and Mint to pee on us.

1644
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:52,630
Good day to be in the frame.

1645
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:59,630
Only under extreme circumstances and you must... you must be stung by a jellyfish.

1646
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,360
It's my good friend Bob...

1647
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,600
Bob's birthday.

1648
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,740
He got into an accident and can't use his arms.

1649
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,340
Can you wish him a happy birthday for me?

1650
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:15,720
I can!

1651
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,740
I'm just gonna say Bob though.

1652
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:20,840
Cause I'm scared.

1653
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,720
Okay, cut that part out.

1654
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,300
Don't tell him that I'm scared.

1655
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,540
Okay, cut that part out.

1656
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:30,440
Don't tell him that I've been burned before.

1657
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,720
Cut that part out.

1658
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,600
Happy birthday to you!

1659
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,820
Happy birthday to you!

1660
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,840
Happy birthday dear Bob!

1661
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:53,520
Happy birthday to you!

1662
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,660
Can I get a happy birthday too?

1663
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:05,400
It was in January?

1664
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,260
No, you can wait until Jan...

1665
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,580
It's already the middle of the year, you guys.

1666
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,360
It's almost the end of May!

1667
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:15,040
Next month?

1668
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,880
In a couple days?

1669
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,420
In like...

1670
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,580
In like a week?

1671
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:21,140
In like a week and a half?

1672
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,260
It will be the middle of 2024.

1673
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:49,110
Back when Sosenkyo was a borderline national holiday in Japan and Ailota would buy thousands of singles to vote, was this behavior based or cringe?

1674
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:53,850
Was Sosenkyo rigged or not?

1675
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:54,310
Thanks.

1676
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,450
Let's see...

1677
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,350
Hmm...

1678
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:03,950
Um...

1679
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:06,990
You know...

1680
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,290
I have to wait until March.

1681
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:12,010
Sorry, man.

1682
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:12,530
Sorry.

1683
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:14,850
I...

1684
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:20,490
When was April 4th and you missed my soup bar?

1685
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:22,410
Really?

1686
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,290
I missed it.

1687
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:26,030
Hold on.

1688
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:28,910
Okay, I'm going to wish you a happy birthday and then I'm going to answer the question.

1689
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:31,530
Happy birthday to you.

1690
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,350
Happy birthday to you.

1691
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:37,510
Happy birthday, dear Solias.

1692
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:42,330
Happy birthday to you.

1693
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,880
Does the jellyfish thing need to be recent because I've been stung before as a kid?

1694
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:55,060
Takeizo is winning the running, everybody!

1695
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,570
Oh no, Takeizo.

1696
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,650
I think you just put a target on yourself.

1697
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:05,390
Okay.

1698
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:06,910
Sosenkyo.

1699
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,990
For those who don't know, Sosenkyo was like this...

1700
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:12,450
I mean, I think they still do it in AKB, right?

1701
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,850
They have a...

1702
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:19,670
They have this big event where...

1703
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:22,690
It's just a voting...

1704
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:23,890
It's a ranking event, essentially.

1705
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,630
That's all it is.

1706
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:27,110
And you vote for your favorite member of AKB48.

1707
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:33,170
And then whoever is in like the top 16 or is like the top girls in the group.

1708
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:35,210
And they get...

1709
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:39,330
And whoever's number one is the center for the next single and things like that.

1710
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:39,950
So...

1711
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:41,870
They haven't done Sosenkyo since 2019.

1712
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:42,430
Really?

1713
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,810
Shows how much...

1714
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:48,070
Shows how much I've paid attention in the past couple of years.

1715
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:50,690
Yeah, you buy CDs to vote.

1716
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:51,570
Essentially.

1717
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:53,530
And...

1718
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,290
Also, I think you're the only person to pronounce my name right.

1719
01:15:58,450 --> 01:15:59,090
Let's go!

1720
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:02,930
But...

1721
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,270
So you...

1722
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:08,650
You buy the CDs and you vote for your favorite girl.

1723
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,810
And then you hope and pray.

1724
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:13,110
And I've participated before.

1725
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:14,910
I've...

1726
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:16,230
I've...

1727
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,050
Bought like...

1728
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:19,090
It wasn't a lot.

1729
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,590
I think it was like two CDs.

1730
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:23,170
So honestly, I made zero difference.

1731
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:26,150
But I...

1732
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:30,710
The people that would buy so many...

1733
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,510
I...

1734
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:31,950
You know what?

1735
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:33,510
No, I don't think that was based.

1736
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:36,890
I think it was a waste.

1737
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,090
I don't think that was based.

1738
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:40,730
I don't think so.

1739
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:41,930
I don't think that was based.

1740
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:43,730
I think...

1741
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:44,950
I think...

1742
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:46,330
Because...

1743
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:47,030
You know...

1744
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:48,070
I think it was...

1745
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:48,210
I...

1746
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:48,690
Yeah.

1747
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:49,830
I don't think it was based.

1748
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:52,050
Cringe then?

1749
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:52,830
Yeah, I guess I...

1750
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:54,130
I guess I could say it was kind of cringe.

1751
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:57,130
And I just don't like...

1752
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,480
I don't really like when...

1753
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:05,520
When...

1754
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,920
When...

1755
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:10,180
Something is like...

1756
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:16,400
Just so solely based on...

1757
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,960
How much money someone can spend.

1758
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,580
I don't know.

1759
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,480
It just feels like kind of wrong.

1760
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,380
Like if I were in something like that...

1761
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,640
I wouldn't want...

1762
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:33,640
Anybody...

1763
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:34,420
Any one of you...

1764
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:35,320
Any of you guys...

1765
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,000
Yeah, pay to win.

1766
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:36,820
Basically.

1767
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:37,680
Yes.

1768
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,500
It's just pay to win.

1769
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,520
And I feel like if I were in that same situation...

1770
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:41,940
And people...

1771
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:42,380
And like...

1772
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:44,400
I wouldn't want you guys to spend your money...

1773
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,640
To like...

1774
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,560
Vote for me.

1775
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,500
And things like that.

1776
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:47,900
I just...

1777
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,920
It just doesn't feel...

1778
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,580
It just doesn't feel good.

1779
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,360
You know?

1780
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:52,180
So...

1781
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:53,760
Yeah.

1782
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,500
I don't know.

1783
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:57,820
Like if that makes you happy...

1784
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,800
Then who am I to stop you?

1785
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,320
But if it's like...

1786
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:02,620
I don't know.

1787
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:02,700
Like...

1788
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,740
It's just...

1789
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:05,680
It's just...

1790
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:05,980
You know?

1791
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:06,900
How much of that...

1792
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,920
Were the girls getting?

1793
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:09,700
And...

1794
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,540
Especially for that...

1795
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:12,260
For like...

1796
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:12,940
So Senkyo...

1797
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:14,520
Like you had to buy so...

1798
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,820
There were people buying tens of thousands of CDs.

1799
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,300
Like an insane amount.

1800
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,120
Someone at Miku Expo Newark...

1801
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,220
A couple weeks ago...

1802
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:22,680
Paid me...

1803
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,300
$120 for my two-year-old...

1804
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,940
Daisenko 200...

1805
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,980
With a broken strap and low batteries...

1806
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,020
And a Miku insert film...

1807
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,540
Because the official pen lights were sold out.

1808
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:32,500
Oh my god.

1809
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:32,600
That's...

1810
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:34,220
$120...

1811
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:34,400
$120 dollars?

1812
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:35,820
I mean...

1813
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,540
For a Daisenko 200?

1814
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,360
Stonks...

1815
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:48,980
That was funny.

1816
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,140
But...

1817
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:52,680
You know...

1818
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:53,460
It's funny...

1819
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:53,960
It's like...

1820
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,200
Funny because I say that...

1821
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,540
But then at the same time...

1822
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,920
There are times when I buy a bunch of CDs...

1823
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,740
For like a checky.

1824
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,280
Or...

1825
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:02,580
Like a CD or...

1826
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,540
But I'm not buying thousands of CDs.

1827
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,920
I'm buying, like, 10 or 20 CDs.

1828
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,020
So... I don't know.

1829
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:17,240
You know, one time I bought a bunch of CDs for a Kickstarter.

1830
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,080
Well, like, I think they came with the Kickstarter.

1831
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,220
And then I got, like, some extra perks.

1832
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,320
Like, I got a video, and I got...

1833
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:25,720
stuff like that.

1834
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,200
And I got...

1835
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,640
I got... some of them were signed by each member.

1836
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,360
So... yeah.

1837
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,640
But... I think it's... if it's like...

1838
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:43,220
If it's for something like to get a checky for yourself, then it makes sense.

1839
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:47,640
But if it's a, like, vote for someone to be the most popular in our group...

1840
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,700
I just don't like.

1841
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:50,160
I don't know.

1842
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,040
I never really liked So Thank You, I'll be honest.

1843
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:52,880
I just didn't.

1844
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:55,240
I just always thought it felt kind of icky.

1845
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:56,700
You know.

1846
01:19:58,380 --> 01:19:58,800
Ugh.

1847
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,540
Pay to win.

1848
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,880
Pay to win just makes me feel icky.

1849
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:03,440
Not in this economy.

1850
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:04,600
You know?

1851
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,380
You can't do that in this...

1852
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,620
It would be so bad.

1853
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:12,280
Anyway.

1854
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,940
It's only an investment to get them later and spread the word, right?

1855
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,340
Well, for me?

1856
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,200
I mean, yeah.

1857
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,980
Got my first pay for my job.

1858
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,620
Thank you.

1859
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:30,600
Because you leaving heaven was the kick in the bum to me to leave.

1860
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:31,540
Oh my gosh!

1861
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,160
Really?

1862
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,600
The fun plans.

1863
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,260
I want to tell you my life is observably better because of you.

1864
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:37,060
Oh my gosh, my dear.

1865
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:37,600
Thank you.

1866
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,020
Congratulations.

1867
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,120
Expensive.

1868
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:46,520
Expensive.

1869
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,060
Oh my gosh.

1870
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:47,480
Fine.

1871
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,920
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

1872
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:49,460
Thank you.

1873
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,400
Thank you so much.

1874
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:56,850
Yeah.

1875
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:58,330
Yeah.

1876
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:58,650
Yeah.

1877
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:06,760
Let's go to another one.

1878
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,060
Wait, there's moon jellies too?

1879
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,600
Oh, they're so pretty.

1880
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:17,300
And actually...

1881
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,660
I don't know which one I like more.

1882
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:27,480
I think I like the other one more because the trails have like a better effect on the screen.

1883
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,440
There's like more going on, right?

1884
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,200
Oh, mangaka!

1885
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,580
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

1886
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,100
Gracias!

1887
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:34,460
Yes!

1888
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:35,320
Thank you!

1889
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,240
I feel like I like the other one better.

1890
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,920
I feel like this one, they need more...

1891
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,160
But look at that.

1892
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,360
That.

1893
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:49,080
It looks like the sand dollars, right?

1894
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:52,180
Looks like the design on a sand dollar.

1895
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:54,180
Oh my god, I want to eat this.

1896
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:55,920
Oh god.

1897
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:01,020
Oh my gosh, someone earlier on Twitter, they posted slime that they made of me.

1898
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,140
And I've never bought slime before.

1899
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:04,040
But I'm gonna buy it and I think I'm gonna eat it.

1900
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,960
It says do not eat on the package, but...

1901
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,360
What if I just do a nibble?

1902
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,280
What if I just...

1903
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,020
Just one like...

1904
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:18,760
You know?

1905
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,220
Slime eating stream.

1906
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,820
Do not eat it, Mint.

1907
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,940
But I really want to.

1908
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:32,260
I'll call poison control.

1909
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,400
Will I actually be poisoned?

1910
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:37,940
Oh no.

1911
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,140
Pee in my mouth.

1912
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,720
Don't do that, Emerine.

1913
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:44,300
I think I regret saying that.

1914
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,140
Let's move on to the next thing.

1915
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,440
What haven't we looked at?

1916
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,480
Did we look at the live open sea cam?

1917
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:53,100
Wow!

1918
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,020
Why are there so many bubbles?

1919
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:04,830
You are alive, young lady.

1920
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:06,410
Here it goes.

1921
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,230
What am I gonna do?

1922
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:07,790
Exactly.

1923
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:08,610
What am I gonna do?

1924
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:09,110
Die again?

1925
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:10,370
Mint.

1926
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:10,750
No!

1927
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:11,990
Don't say that, Evan!

1928
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:29,730
Okay, I think this one will trigger some like...

1929
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:31,790
What's that fear of the deep ocean?

1930
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:34,050
The phastless foam phobia.

1931
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:38,590
I think this one would kind of trigger that in some people.

1932
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:39,510
Because the dark...

1933
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:41,170
Like the background is so dark.

1934
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:43,050
And you just see the fish kind of coming out of nowhere.

1935
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:54,030
I passed my certification exam after work after studying for months.

1936
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:57,710
I celebrated by ordering an IMAX figure.

1937
01:23:57,850 --> 01:23:58,330
Let's go!

1938
01:23:58,570 --> 01:23:58,990
Congratulations!

1939
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,070
I knew you had this!

1940
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:02,650
I knew you had this!

1941
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:04,090
Mint.

1942
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:05,490
No, don't say that.

1943
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,290
Fish jump scare.

1944
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,310
Do you guys have that phobia?

1945
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:14,770
Oh!

1946
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:20,190
They're zooming.

1947
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:28,490
I was stung by tiny jellyfishes when our family was on a trip to the beach and it turned out the whole beach was infested by it.

1948
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,550
Later that day, the beach was closed because of it.

1949
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:31,270
Holy cow!

1950
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:33,950
I've never had...

1951
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:36,510
I've never had a jellyfish sting.

1952
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:37,230
But...

1953
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:38,950
What was it?

1954
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:42,190
I remember going to the beach once as a kid.

1955
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:45,370
And I don't think I got it.

1956
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:46,730
But my sister got it.

1957
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:47,930
My sister got sea lice.

1958
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:49,950
Which I didn't even know was a thing.

1959
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:52,210
Do you guys know that sea lice is a thing?

1960
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:56,310
I'm gonna go back to the birds.

1961
01:24:59,150 --> 01:24:59,590
Oh!

1962
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:00,610
Or the beach.

1963
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:04,210
What is sea lice?

1964
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:05,310
I don't know.

1965
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:06,670
But it like...

1966
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:09,030
I remember it caused like...

1967
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,250
Hold on.

1968
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:09,970
I'm gonna look it up.

1969
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:12,650
Sea...

1970
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:14,810
Sea...

1971
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:16,190
Lice.

1972
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,830
They're little tiny creatures.

1973
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:20,490
They're cope pods.

1974
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:21,390
Oh no!

1975
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:26,030
They're cope pods.

1976
01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:27,710
Copee...

1977
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:28,490
Copee pods.

1978
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:35,510
But they cause all these like really bad red bumps all over my sister's leg.

1979
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:40,270
Sand fleas.

1980
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:42,450
I don't know.

1981
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:45,210
Ew!

1982
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:45,710
Ew!

1983
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:46,670
Don't look at the pictures.

1984
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:48,990
Copee pods.

1985
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:54,310
Going to sleep but before I wanted to tell you I love you.

1986
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:55,110
You're my favorite nerd.

1987
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:56,390
Bye bye.

1988
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:57,350
Have a fun nerdy stream.

1989
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:57,950
Thanks.

1990
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:58,430
Here you go.

1991
01:25:58,690 --> 01:25:58,990
Goodnight.

1992
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:03,590
I thought Kojima made those up for MGS2.

1993
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:04,730
What?

1994
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:05,390
The sea lice?

1995
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:06,290
No.

1996
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:07,350
Those were different, weren't they?

1997
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,330
Those were the...

1998
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:10,090
What were they?

1999
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:10,690
Fleas?

2000
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,150
Sea fleas.

2001
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:12,430
Sea fleas.

2002
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:14,750
Are they real sea fleas?

2003
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:18,110
Or they were a different kind of pod?

2004
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:27,590
Remember one time a jellyfish spawning season almost destroyed an aircraft carrier.

2005
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:30,330
I was on by clogging up all the cooling water.

2006
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:30,830
What?

2007
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:32,830
That's crazy.

2008
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:43,940
But...

2009
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:44,700
But...

2010
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,140
But...

2011
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,760
Sea lice are very tiny.

2012
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,760
They're small, small little guys.

2013
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:51,520
I'm pretty sure.

2014
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,240
They're teeny tiny.

2015
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,900
And then they get on you and they...

2016
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,720
And then they give you bad rash.

2017
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:03,620
And it happened to my sister.

2018
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,700
Top Gun in the movies versus Top Gun in real life.

2019
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,500
What do you mean by that?

2020
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,140
How did you know I watched Top Gun?

2021
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,120
I had a question about Top Gun.

2022
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,280
Is there...

2023
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,740
Do bird strikes really happen?

2024
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,500
Is that really something?

2025
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,020
Is there something that can like just take out a plane?

2026
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:25,320
If a bunch of birds run into a plane?

2027
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,640
Do you watch Top Gun every time?

2028
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:30,780
Yes!

2029
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:34,940
Yes, I do.

2030
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:41,560
The carrier almost got destroyed just because sea lights clogged up the cooling water?

2031
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:42,800
Sounds like a chill issue.

2032
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,820
It's very dangerous.

2033
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:48,200
Can take down even big planes?

2034
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,800
Oh no, new fear.

2035
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:49,980
New fear.

2036
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,240
Rashes?

2037
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:55,620
Oh sorry, we're talking about sea lice.

2038
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,860
If sea lice exist, do sea monkeys groom themselves with them?

2039
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,240
Spent.

2040
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,360
Flammu.

2041
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:14,880
Spent.

2042
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,000
Spent.

01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,500
The picture they used for this is so funny.

2053
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:17,520
It's like this bird looking directly at the camera.

2054
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:22,360
A bird strike is what caused the plane to go down in the Hudson.

2055
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:24,940
Wait, no it didn't.

2056
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,680
Long time donator, pilot, or first time viewer.

2057
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,820
A bird strike is actually what took down the plane Captain Sullenberg was piloting.

2058
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,180
That became the miracle on the Hudson in 2011.

2059
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,180
Wait, seriously?

2060
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:37,700
Wait.

2061
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,260
Bird strike.

2062
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,560
No way!

2063
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:50,240
Wait, I'm seeing 2009.

2064
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,920
I remember hearing about this though.

2065
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,300
That's so scary.

2066
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,340
So how do they... how would like...

2067
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:09,560
You know, you're flying.

2068
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,960
What, do you have like radars that show where birds are?

2069
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:13,860
Like how...

2070
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:15,240
How do you avoid that?

2071
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,580
Oh no, I saw that bird!

2072
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:22,880
Look it.

2073
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:23,720
Chicken cannons.

2074
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,160
They fire them for tests.

2075
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,360
I fucking looked it up.

2076
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,700
They made a movie, I think.

2077
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:29,240
Really?

2078
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,400
Hudson River.

2079
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:32,460
Two years ago.

2080
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,580
Not sea lice.

2081
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,560
Giant jellyfish clogged up the carrier's intakes.

2082
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,360
They were being scraped off for days.

2083
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:40,480
Oh, gross.

2084
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:44,220
If you like Top Gun, have you ever considered playing Ace Combat?

2085
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:47,340
People like to describe it as MGS with fighter jets.

2086
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,020
Without how over the top the story gets.

2087
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:49,500
I do!

2088
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,660
Um, probably.

2089
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:56,800
Once I get back from Japan, I'll probably start Ace Combat.

2090
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,840
I don't know which one to start from though.

2091
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:02,980
I'm still trying to decide.

2092
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,700
But probably once I get back from Japan.

2093
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,280
Because I'm trying to avoid...

2094
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:07,860
Or...

2095
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,960
Maybe in August I can start it.

2096
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:14,300
Because I'm trying to avoid it with like some of my bigger events.

2097
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,020
That I'm...

2098
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,340
You know, if I'm going out of town or something like that.

2099
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:19,040
So...

2100
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,520
Wait, you're going to Japan again?

2101
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:22,280
I am!

2102
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:25,640
I'll be going to Japan again with Matara this time.

2103
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,160
We actually have some plans that we'll be doing.

2104
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,600
But I'll still be streaming while I'm there.

2105
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,680
She and I decided we're going to be streaming every other day together.

2106
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:36,340
So we're going to be like...

2107
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:38,000
One day she'll be streaming.

2108
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,960
And then, you know, you might hear me in the background.

2109
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,460
I might be like, Matara!

2110
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:44,400
I'm taking a shower.

2111
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,220
Don't go streaming in the bathroom.

2112
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,900
Stuff like that.

2113
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:51,420
So...

2114
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:57,760
And we plan to at least...

2115
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,580
Let's see, what time is it now in Japan?

2116
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:01,490
We hope to stream...

2117
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:06,560
It will probably be a little bit later than our usual streaming times.

2118
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,410
But we're going to try and stream...

2119
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:12,980
At our usual time.

2120
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,500
So we'll wake up early and stream.

2121
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:18,200
And then go about our lives.

2122
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:18,480
Another day.

2123
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:21,940
But there might be also some night time ones on our end, so...

2124
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,040
Hot tub stream...

2125
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:36,270
She went to the bathroom, she would find a wisp with a jellyfish sting on the floor.

2126
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:39,430
How would you get there?

2127
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:42,750
First of all, I would say...

2128
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:44,610
How did you...

2129
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:46,630
I would say, where did this jellyfish come from?

2130
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:47,730
I think that's what I'd say first.

2131
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:48,330
And then I'd say...

2132
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:49,790
Why are you in my house?

2133
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:51,870
Shout out to Giri's house.

2134
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:53,090
Soon to be Matara's house.

2135
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:57,390
Well, the plan is that we're rooming together.

2136
01:32:57,710 --> 01:32:59,430
But if she wants to go to Giri's house...

2137
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:00,970
More room for me.

2138
01:33:01,730 --> 01:33:02,370
I guess.

2139
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:06,270
Why is nothing happening on this live stream?

2140
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:09,550
Sorry guys, I picked a really lame one.

2141
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:10,990
Let's go back to Otter Camp.

2142
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:14,630
So cute!

2143
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:21,610
The jellyfish was in luggage.

2144
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:23,170
I've seen a girl...

2145
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:25,110
They're here!

2146
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:29,350
They're here!

2147
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:30,070
They're here!

2148
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:30,910
So many vids, thank you!

2149
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:33,050
Thank you for haunting everyone at ASUN this past weekend.

2150
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:36,210
Hope you're showered with gifts in the future.

2151
01:33:36,330 --> 01:33:39,290
And in honor of your cafe guests, here's a little philanthropy.

2152
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:42,690
Thank you!

2153
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:43,930
Thank you so much.

2154
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:52,050
I don't remember what I was saying.

2155
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:55,910
Rosa the otter?

2156
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:58,210
You guys know the names of the otter here?

2157
01:33:59,270 --> 01:33:59,850
Oh wait, sorry.

2158
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:01,870
I'm seeing if they...

2159
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:08,110
These female sea otters are all rescued and non-releasable to the wild for health or behavioral reasons.

2160
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:11,110
They play an important role for their species at the aquarium.

2161
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:17,850
Not only as ambassadors to otter kind for our guests, but also as surrogate mothers for stranded sea otter pups.

2162
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:19,690
Oh, that's so sweet!

2163
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:24,210
Is your favorite scene in Top Gun the volleyball scene?

2164
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:33,690
Oh my gosh, it's so funny because when I was watching Top Gun Maverick on this trip, I found myself...

2165
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:37,830
I was like skipping through all the relationship drawings.

2166
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:41,450
Which usually, I eat that up.

2167
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:42,930
Usually I'm just like...

2168
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:49,210
You know, I like to watch romance movies sometimes and things like that, like whatever, but...

2169
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:52,210
This time I was skipping through all...

2170
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:52,510
I was...

2171
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:56,670
I was like, I don't care about you, lady.

2172
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:58,730
And then I'd be like, get to the mission already.

2173
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:02,910
Which like, I found very...

2174
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:06,930
Different from what I'm usually like.

2175
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:11,810
Oh my god, Robo!

2176
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:14,830
Thank you for the very big akutoro!

2177
01:35:15,490 --> 01:35:20,150
I finally passed my defense and signed a job offer last week!

2178
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:23,190
I've had some tough times.

2179
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:23,770
Tough times.

2180
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:24,610
Tough times, buddy.

2181
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:27,450
And I really want to thank you for always being around and being mean to me.

2182
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:28,850
Oh, by the way, I put you in my acknowledgement.

2183
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:31,950
I hope you don't mind it!

2184
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:32,230
Oh my

2185
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,960
gosh, thank you!

2186
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,040
And congratulations!

2187
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:40,760
Oh my gosh, congrats!

2188
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,540
I knew you had it!

2189
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:47,660
You had it in you the whole time.

2190
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,380
Oh my gosh, congrats, Robo!

2191
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:52,360
Thank you so much for the really big akutoro!

2192
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:52,900
Thank you!

2193
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:56,120
That's so fun.

2194
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,960
Oh my gosh, I don't think I've ever been in a...

2195
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,320
an acknowledgement before!

2196
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:00,380
Wow!

2197
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:03,120
Oh my gosh, what did you say that I...

2198
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,040
What did I do?

2199
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:05,140
Uh...

2200
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:06,980
Uh...

2201
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:08,300
Um...

2202
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:09,180
Uh...

2203
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,560
Provided a minty, fresh experience.

2204
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:13,220
Remind...

2205
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,060
Wait...

2206
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:16,600
Was your...

2207
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,120
Was your...

2208
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,060
Was your thing on me?

2209
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:26,060
There was a streamer named Doug that raised 300k for Rosa the sea otter's birthday!

2210
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,160
Wow!

2211
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,020
That's incredible!

2212
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,400
They actually...

2213
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:37,240
On the Monterey Bay Aquarium YouTube, they have a donation thing that says...

2214
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:41,100
We get by with a little kelp from our fronds.

2215
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:43,200
But you can donate.

2216
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:45,500
It says total raise is $20,000.

2217
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,080
I think I'll raise that.

2218
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,000
Have you heard about the surfboard thief sea otter?

2219
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:56,460
I'm not.

2220
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:56,860
I don't know why.

2221
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:00,280
Bite, say, sizz.

2222
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:01,940
Thanks very much.

2223
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,400
Thank you.

2224
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,540
9 out of 10 dentists recommend mint phantom.

2225
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:10,100
Absolutely.

2226
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:12,100
Absolutely.

2227
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,140
Almost 4k...

2228
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:17,080
Oh, sorry.

2229
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:17,860
I don't look at the numbers.

2230
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:18,200
Sorry.

2231
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,140
Don't tell me how many people are watching.

2232
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:22,280
Four people are watching.

2233
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:22,900
Spooky number.

2234
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:24,560
Spooky number.

2235
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:26,580
Thank you for...

2236
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:28,040
Thank you guys for hanging out with me.

2237
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:29,300
I really appreciate it.

2238
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:33,000
I'm not even doing anything.

2239
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,340
I'm barely even talking about anything.

2240
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:39,460
Mint type?

2241
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:39,860
Oops.

2242
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:41,700
Donned!

2243
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:42,820
Thank you!

2244
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:45,880
Thank you!

2245
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:46,160
Thank you!

2246
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:48,540
I'm one of the four.

2247
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:51,560
It's calm.

2248
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:52,900
Yeah, we're just chilling.

2249
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:53,760
We're just hanging out.

2250
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,860
And I'll... I'll change the title and stuff... afterwards.

2251
01:37:59,380 --> 01:37:59,800
Woah!

2252
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:01,080
He just went through the tube!

2253
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:05,780
Do it again, Otter!

2254
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:06,300
Do it again!

2255
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,500
Today was quite busy for me.

2256
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:19,400
I was catching up... with a bunch of...

2257
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,440
Actually, I haven't caught up with emails yet.

2258
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,260
I've caught up with messages, I believe.

2259
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:23,900
To people.

2260
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:28,020
I had to pay a bunch of people because I was paying for like...

2261
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:31,520
Art for the Patreon postcards for the podcast.

2262
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:37,380
I bought some extra little things...

2263
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:39,620
For Off-Kai.

2264
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:43,900
If you are going to Off-Kai, if you're going to the...

2265
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:46,620
To the... I think we said the panel.

2266
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:50,520
If you go to the panel, you'll get maybe a little extra thing if you come early.

2267
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:51,920
So...

2268
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:55,700
Have the postcards been sent?

2269
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:56,040
No!

2270
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:57,860
I know, it's really...

2271
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,540
Super duper delayed.

2272
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:02,180
I'm so sorry, you guys.

2273
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:03,660
We're going to be sending the...

2274
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:05,700
First two...

2275
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:07,840
April, May, together.

2276
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:09,480
They will be sent.

2277
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:12,100
Almost all the art is done for them.

2278
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,180
But we just have to sign them.

2279
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:17,060
We haven't met up.

2280
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,420
She was...

2281
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:20,800
Matara was supposed to come to my place.

2282
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,900
My cafe at the beginning of the month.

2283
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:23,580
And she didn't.

2284
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:24,120
So...

2285
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,740
We're going to ship them during Off-Kai.

2286
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:28,320
I believe.

2287
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:32,960
Since you mentioned it.

2288
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:36,100
Can you show the tough times never last video for the new Wisps?

2289
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:36,860
I never saw it.

2290
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:37,580
Thanks for the stream.

2291
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:38,360
Freaking ghost mate.

2292
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:38,860
Again!

2293
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:39,800
I have it.

2294
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:41,620
I have it somewhere.

2295
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:42,100
Hold on.

2296
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:46,000
Maybe it was under here.

2297
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:47,200
Oh my god!

2298
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:47,780
He's crawling!

2299
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:48,940
Oh my god!

2300
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:50,160
He looks just like Buta.

2301
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,380
He looks just like Buta!

2302
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:56,840
He looks just like Buta!

2303
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,280
No way...

2304
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,320
Oh my god!

2305
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,440
That looks just like my cat!

2306
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:03,760
That looks just...

2307
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,200
I gotta add a cat...

2308
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:05,680
Um...

2309
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:07,640
Emote, don't I?

2310
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,580
I gotta commission more emotes, don't I?

2311
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:10,900
See you at Off-Kai!

2312
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,960
I'm even going to the mate cafe after your meet-and-greet.

2313
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:14,300
Thanks, Rude!

2314
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:15,920
Okay.

2315
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,100
I think I found it.

2316
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,100
Oh wait.

2317
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:18,740
Um...

2318
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:21,640
No, these are all my idle videos.

2319
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:25,020
Oh my gosh!

2320
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:25,640
Oh my gosh!

2321
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,080
Oh my gosh!

2322
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,220
I didn't even know I had these on here.

2323
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,300
There's videos of me...

2324
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:33,020
Okay, so a long time ago...

2325
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:34,000
Um...

2326
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,340
My Oshii...

2327
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:39,240
I would do like video calls with her.

2328
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:40,980
And um...

2329
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:42,920
You're not allowed to record them.

2330
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:45,320
So I would record myself...

2331
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,100
Talking to her.

2332
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:50,140
So I would say, like...

2333
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:52,820
I would set up my camera behind me so that...

2334
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,900
But not enough so she could see that I was recording it.

2335
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,230
So I have...

2336
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:59,000
Oh my god.

2337
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,780
It's me sitting in my closet!

2338
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,360
Like back when I used to stream in my closet.

2339
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,380
Oh my gosh.

2340
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:08,280
I had no idea that that video was there.

2341
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:09,960
That's so funny.

2342
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:11,620
Wow.

2343
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:20,090
I also have...

2344
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:20,530
Sorry.

2345
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:22,450
I'm looking through my pictures folder right now.

2346
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:24,270
Which I don't have a ton of stuff in here.

2347
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:24,950
But I do have a lot of stuff in here.

2348
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:27,450
But I have a folder called Google Earth VR.

2349
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:29,310
And the only...

2350
01:41:29,310 --> 01:41:30,390
I don't know why I have this.

2351
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:33,010
The only thing I have in here is...

2352
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:35,490
ShuangGao.

2353
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:37,250
But I think it's upside down.

2354
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:38,710
And also...

2355
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:42,590
It's called ShuangGao.jpeg.

2356
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:46,670
Did I take this?

2357
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:49,830
Shuang...

2358
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:50,990
Shuang...

2359
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:51,650
Shuang...

2360
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:52,570
Shuang...

2361
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:53,470
Shuang...

2362
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:54,930
Shuang...

2363
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:59,430
I don't know why I have this.

2364
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:02,710
I don't even remember using Google Earth VR.

2365
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:05,050
Okay.

2366
01:42:05,090 --> 01:42:06,290
I'm still looking for the video.

2367
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:09,370
It's not under videos.

2368
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:11,550
Maybe...

2369
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:18,690
I still have to open the door of my microwave.

2370
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:22,090
It'll turn on automatically while it's open.

2371
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:23,350
Do you think it's a ghost?

2372
01:42:23,430 --> 01:42:23,630
Wait.

2373
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,210
It's turning on while the door is open?

2374
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:28,390
I think you need to throw that away.

2375
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:29,990
I think you need to disassemble that.

2376
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:32,290
I think that's not safe.

2377
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,530
I think that's pretty bad.

2378
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:42,340
You put your ShuangGao away, young man.

2379
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:43,280
Sorry.

2380
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,500
Have you ever gone flying upside down over the German countryside?

2381
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:50,880
Apparently, I have in VR.

2382
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:53,240
You know...

2383
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:55,060
I can't keep still.

2384
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:56,560
I'm probably going to die.

2385
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,400
I know I'm, like, crazy, out of control, wild.

2386
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:06,930
Where could it be?

2387
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:14,770
I thought it was under here.

2388
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:15,870
Wait.

2389
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:16,250
What is this?

2390
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:22,540
I don't know.

2391
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:33,840
Somebody stop her.

2392
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:36,220
Now this is going to drive me crazy.

2393
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:36,820
This is crazy though.

2394
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,140
This is going to drive me crazy.

2395
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:46,660
You know what?

2396
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:47,320
I just had an idea.

2397
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:53,660
I had an idea for people who can't make it to the meet and greet.

2398
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,200
Maybe, maybe.

2399
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:07,420
If I can't find the video today, I'll find it eventually and then I'll show it eventually.

2400
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,220
Sorry.

2401
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,940
I really have no idea where it's at.

2402
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:10,760
Where it's at.

2403
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,880
But I saw it recently.

2404
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,820
Wait, that means the other videos that were in there are gone too.

2405
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,500
No, where's all my stuff?

2406
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:21,660
Idea?

2407
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,060
A VR meetup?

2408
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,000
Stop spoiling it!

2409
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:28,660
What if we meet in VR chat?

2410
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:33,040
But I don't have a model.

2411
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,120
I don't have a 3D model I could use.

2412
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:40,060
Please, I lost the meet and greet.

2413
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:43,880
You don't need a meet and greet to meet me.

2414
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:01,100
Frog model?

2415
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:04,700
Would you love me even if I'm a frog?

2416
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:08,520
What is this guy doing over here in the corner?

2417
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:12,380
He's like circling around with his tail.

2418
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,060
What is he doing?

2419
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:18,160
I think he's playing.

2420
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:36,830
You're only gonna love me if I'm a frog.

2421
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:40,820
I'd even love you more if you were a frog.

2422
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:42,500
I would love you more if you were a frog.

2423
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:45,040
Do I need to get a frog outfit?

2424
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:50,620
I was thinking about that though I was like, what kind of outfits do I want?

2425
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,800
I already have my next outfit plans.

2426
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,400
So you can't choose that one.

2427
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:54,600
I was like, what kind of outfits do I want?

2428
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:59,000
But, maybe in the future, if you guys ever want to give me ideas for a third outfit.

2429
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:06,940
Who knows.

2430
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,980
Ghost made bikini.

2431
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:13,960
That was so fast.

2432
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,080
That was so...

2433
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:24,720
That was so like...

2434
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,640
Here's my chance.

2435
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:29,980
Swimsuit.

2436
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:39,640
I thanked my friend Mint for unconditional emotional support.

2437
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,240
I haven't come out as a weeb yet.

2438
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,580
I was too shy to say my Oshii.

2439
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:48,460
You're a weeb!

2440
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:49,520
Oh my gosh.

2441
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:53,620
I've reached peak weeb levels, everybody.

2442
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,620
I have reached...

2443
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:59,320
I have reached extreme weeb levels that cannot be...

2444
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:00,440
Undone, I believe.

2445
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:02,780
Which, I mean, is pretty...

2446
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,160
Kermit the frog.

2447
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,700
Which are like...

2448
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:09,900
Okay, first of all...

2449
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:11,040
When I was...

2450
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,320
When I was waiting to go home, I was getting food.

2451
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:15,800
And I got...

2452
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,840
It was like a Greek bowl.

2453
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:19,500
I got like a Greek bowl.

2454
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:21,560
And when I was getting my food...

2455
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:23,260
The person checking me out...

2456
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:25,160
Was just like, by the way...

2457
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,540
We're out of...

2458
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:27,560
And it was in a food court.

2459
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:29,440
So they were like, we're out of...

2460
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,500
We're out of spoons.

2461
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:34,320
You can go next door and get chopsticks from the...

2462
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,980
From the...

2463
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:37,700
From the Chinese place.

2464
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:41,280
And use those to eat it instead.

2465
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:45,400
Thank you for the...

2466
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:46,320
Thank you for the...

2467
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:49,780
Phantom boy.

2468
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,400
Phantom boy!

2469
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:58,940
Your hergule floor...

2470
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,740
Never akasupas when I can acknowledge it.

2471
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,260
It must be really important to you...

2472
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:06,620
To get the phantom boy.

2473
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,380
I wasn't going to off-card because I was scared.

2474
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:16,540
But someone convinced me to go.

2475
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,420
Didn't win the lottery.

2476
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:19,020
But I was drawing fan art to give to you.

2477
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:19,480
It's Ben.

2478
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:19,900
No!

2479
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:20,640
No!

2480
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,740
I'm excited to go to my first condo.

2481
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,260
Thanks for making me go out of my comfort zone.

2482
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:26,100
Oh my gosh!

2483
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:26,360
Amelia!

2484
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,980
I hope we have a wonderful, wonderful time.

2485
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:30,020
I hope we can meet somehow.

2486
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,140
Got home from gym.

2487
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:37,340
Very tired but productive.

2488
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:39,180
Watched the podcast during and wondering...

2489
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:39,960
If you're able...

2490
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:42,220
If you're able to show us the pic of your two cats getting along.

2491
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:42,740
Oh!

2492
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,520
I posted it on Twitter sideways.

2493
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,220
Sorry that the editor missed it.

2494
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,800
But yeah...

2495
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:51,380
I had to use...

2496
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:52,300
I had to use chopsticks...

2497
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:53,720
I had to use chopsticks for my Greek food.

2498
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,600
And I felt really silly about that.

2499
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:56,540
So I was just like...

2500
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:57,280
Gosh, I feel...

2501
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:00,120
I feel like a weeb in this regard.

2502
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,040
But then...

2503
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:05,940
When I was hanging out with Ayami-sensei and our managers and everything...

2504
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,180
They were just like...

2505
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:08,060
You know, Minto...

2506
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:09,880
You're...

2507
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:10,800
You're...

2508
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,180
Are you sure you're American?

2509
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,160
I was like...

2510
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,420
I mean...

2511
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:18,440
I guess I'm an American ghost.

2512
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:19,260
Chu!

2513
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,140
Thank you!

2514
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:21,000
Yenway!

2515
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:26,260
If my health improves, I'd love to go to a con and give you my Rex and Ray model kits.

2516
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:26,760
Oh my gosh.

2517
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,700
They're painted Itasha style with an unrelated Vtuber on them.

2518
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:32,160
So that would be weird...

2519
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:34,420
So would that be weird or inappropriate?

2520
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,260
I might still make mint Itasha versions later.

2521
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:43,020
I don't know if I would be able to bring them back without breaking them though.

2522
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,720
I'd be so nervous.

2523
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,940
But I would love to accept them.

2524
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:54,800
Even still, if you are willing to part with them, I'd feel bad if you put them together and painted them and everything.

2525
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:58,220
Nexy!

2526
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:01,260
Phantom boy.

2527
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:04,500
Thank you for the Akasufa!

2528
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,060
Thank you!

2529
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:07,780
Oh my gosh.

2530
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,420
But yeah...

2531
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:12,180
When I was like...

2532
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:12,180
Oh!

2533
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,200
I think everything's coming through now.

2534
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:15,440
Spy turtle!

2535
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:17,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2536
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,860
Hey buddy, you're not welcome.

2537
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:19,980
You're not welcome here, spy turtle.

2538
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:21,680
This is...

2539
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:23,760
This is an anti-BBC area.

2540
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:26,980
No British here.

2541
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:28,720
No broadcasting.

2542
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:32,800
Finished making a devil's food kit from scratch.

2543
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:34,540
Gosh, how are you so...

2544
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:36,060
handy.

2545
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:38,380
You have bees.

2546
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:39,560
You cook.

2547
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:40,820
Are you...

2548
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:41,640
Are you a weeb?

2549
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,760
How are you like this?

2550
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,260
How do you watch me and have your life so well together?

2551
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:51,380
But um...

2552
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:54,920
But yeah, when I was hanging out with Ayami-sama...

2553
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,160
Sensei's manager.

2554
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:59,160
She is Ayami-sama to me.

2555
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,920
When I was hanging out with their manager and stuff, they were like, Are you sure you're American?

2556
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:02,620
And I was like...

2557
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:06,340
I mean, I...

2558
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,840
I don't remember quite where I died, but I think I died in America.

2559
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,960
And they were like...

2560
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:14,980
They were like, you...

2561
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:16,860
You act too Japanese.

2562
01:51:18,740 --> 01:51:19,460
They were like, you...

2563
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:21,080
They were like...

2564
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:22,940
I was like, well, I have like, you know...

2565
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:24,540
I have family in Japan too.

2566
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:25,600
But...

2567
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,120
They were like, you act...

2568
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:27,620
You...

2569
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:28,460
The way you...

2570
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:29,080
You...

2571
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:29,860
Your manners...

2572
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:33,580
Everything is way too Japanese for you to be American.

2573
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:34,580
I was like...

2574
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:36,280
In my brain, I was just like, this is it?

2575
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,220
This is...

2576
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:43,680
This is what every weeaboo probably ever aspires to have said to them.

2577
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:45,460
You have assimilated...

2578
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:46,540
I know.

2579
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,260
I am...

2580
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:51,560
And I've been told before.

2581
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:52,440
It's so funny.

2582
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:53,960
I've been told before.

2583
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,200
Like, one time I was in a taxi.

2584
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,880
I was getting driven home by a taxi driver in Japan.

2585
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:00,980
And...

2586
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:02,880
He was talking with me.

2587
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:03,920
And...

2588
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:05,600
He was just like...

2589
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:06,040
Wow.

2590
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:09,560
You are like, you know, Japanese is good and this and that, whatever.

2591
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,420
And you like...

2592
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,540
You seem very Japanese.

2593
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:13,600
I think...

2594
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,740
I think you are reincarnated Japanese.

2595
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:16,640
Well...

2596
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,540
I don't know.

2597
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:17,760
I...

2598
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:18,720
Like...

2599
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:20,460
My past ghost...

2600
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:20,900
You know...

2601
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,220
It's kind of confusing.

2602
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,020
I guess when you bring reincarnation into it.

2603
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:24,740
But...

2604
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:25,540
He was just like...

2605
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:27,660
I think you were once Japanese in a past life.

2606
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:28,260
And I was like...

2607
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:29,460
I don't...

2608
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:30,500
I'm...

2609
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:32,760
You guys...

2610
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:33,040
I'm a...

2611
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:33,520
I'm a...

2612
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,000
I'm a Japanese princess.

2613
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:40,590
Sorry.

2614
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:41,090
Hold on.

2615
01:52:41,170 --> 01:52:41,490
It's...

2616
01:52:41,490 --> 01:52:42,210
I cannot...

2617
01:52:42,210 --> 01:52:44,850
I don't know what's wrong with YouTube raids.

2618
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:46,010
But the thing...

2619
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,810
Look at it.

2620
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:47,970
I have to screenshot it.

2621
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:48,670
I cannot...

2622
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:49,750
I think it said Nyaaru.

2623
01:52:50,370 --> 01:52:51,610
Thank you for the...

2624
01:52:52,270 --> 01:52:52,790
Raid!

2625
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:53,390
Thank you!

2626
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:55,230
Thank you so much!

2627
01:52:55,730 --> 01:52:59,070
This is what I see when I get a raid.

2628
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:00,370
Something's wrong with YouTube.

2629
01:53:04,030 --> 01:53:06,990
I can't see the name of the person.

2630
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:09,170
Look at this.

2631
01:53:09,610 --> 01:53:10,850
This is what shows up.

2632
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:11,290
Oh yeah.

2633
01:53:11,310 --> 01:53:11,670
I see it.

2634
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:13,170
Nyaaru-chu!

2635
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:14,570
Thank you for the raid!

2636
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:17,950
I can't see the name of the person.

2637
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:19,050
It's just white!

2638
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:24,490
Thank you for the gift, Ducky.

2639
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:25,170
Thank you.

2640
01:53:25,610 --> 01:53:27,590
Did you die by truck gun?

2641
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:29,110
Who knows?

2642
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:35,410
Sorry if I missed somebody's raid because I can't read it because YouTube is broken!

2643
01:53:38,670 --> 01:53:39,970
YouTube's actually broken.

2644
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:42,530
White on white, Sasuga.

2645
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:48,850
Um...

2646
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:49,930
Yeah.

2647
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:50,510
Um...

2648
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:50,930
Everybody, I'm sorry.

2649
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:51,330
Somebody coming in.

2650
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:51,610
Hi!

2651
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:52,810
I'm a Japanese...

2652
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:54,170
Well, I'm dead.

2653
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:54,910
I'm a mint!

2654
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:55,630
I'm a ghost!

2655
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:56,610
I died.

2656
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:57,690
But I'm also...

2657
01:53:57,690 --> 01:53:59,210
Maybe I was once a Japanese princess.

2658
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:00,930
Pre-incarnated.

2659
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:02,630
And then I died again.

2660
01:54:02,770 --> 01:54:03,130
I guess.

2661
01:54:04,990 --> 01:54:05,390
According...

2662
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:08,310
Two Japanese people have told me that I'm a Jap...

2663
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:09,970
Well, he didn't say I was a Japanese princess.

2664
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:18,670
I've had the white on white YouTube problem for the last week.

2665
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:19,490
It's so weird.

2666
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:19,790
Yeah.

2667
01:54:19,810 --> 01:54:20,730
It just started recently.

2668
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:20,910
It's weird.

2669
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:21,050
I'm like, okay?

2670
01:54:21,050 --> 01:54:21,890
Hi Roboc!

2671
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:22,970
Thanks for the 10ped coins.

2672
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:23,630
Thank you.

2673
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:26,250
Um...

2674
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:28,770
Yeah, I've reached...

2675
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:29,790
I've reached peak.

2676
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:32,330
I've reached every weeaboo's dream.

2677
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:37,130
This is...

2678
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:37,810
I can't go...

2679
01:54:37,810 --> 01:54:39,850
I can't go any higher than this.

2680
01:54:40,170 --> 01:54:41,890
Can we get much higher?

2681
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:42,870
No!

2682
01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:44,210
This is it!

2683
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:45,850
I'm...

2684
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:50,010
I'm secret Nihonj- Look at him play with the donut!

2685
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:50,190
Oh no!

2686
01:54:52,770 --> 01:54:56,870
For everybody also coming in, hi, we're watching animal live cams.

2687
01:54:57,990 --> 01:55:03,670
From the Monterey Bay Aquarium area.

2688
01:55:06,450 --> 01:55:07,270
Yes, yes, yes.

2689
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:08,730
Wait a second.

2690
01:55:08,970 --> 01:55:09,790
Did I miss some?

2691
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:10,250
Hold on.

2692
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:11,390
Bloodlust, thank you for the...

2693
01:55:12,090 --> 01:55:13,870
Rogue Barabba, thank you for the 50 gifted!

2694
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:14,350
Wait a second.

2695
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:14,850
Wait, wait, wait.

2696
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:16,050
Am I missing some?

2697
01:55:16,290 --> 01:55:17,310
Bloodlust, thank you for the 10!

2698
01:55:19,450 --> 01:55:20,670
Dragonuity, thank you for the 5!

2699
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:22,670
Chris in the Box, thank you for the 5!

2700
01:55:22,770 --> 01:55:23,190
Thank you guys!

2701
01:55:24,950 --> 01:55:25,930
I think I missed some.

2702
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:26,410
Oh gosh.

2703
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:32,830
Let's go to a new one because all the otters have left.

2704
01:55:33,810 --> 01:55:34,490
Spider cam!

2705
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:41,410
Oh my gosh, this one is so scary.

2706
01:55:42,630 --> 01:55:43,590
Also, it's broken!

2707
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:46,670
They go here every time and then it freezes.

2708
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:48,670
I think it's broke.

2709
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:50,350
Aw, that's sad.

2710
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:50,950
Okay.

2711
01:55:51,290 --> 01:55:52,750
Let's watch the penguins again.

2712
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:54,870
Oh my god!

2713
01:55:55,090 --> 01:55:56,630
Look at all this shit!

2714
01:55:56,710 --> 01:55:57,450
This guy!

2715
01:55:59,050 --> 01:55:59,570
Oh!

2716
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:00,610
Oh!

2717
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:03,310
Oh my goodness.

2718
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:05,030
But this guy, I think, has had an...

2719
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:08,290
Either he's molting or he just shit himself.

2720
01:56:08,770 --> 01:56:10,070
This guy needs a diaper.

2721
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:13,030
Look at him.

2722
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:16,290
He shit himself looking at the riaju penguins over here.

2723
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:17,990
There's a couple here, there's a couple here.

2724
01:56:18,170 --> 01:56:20,870
And he's just looking on with envy.

2725
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:26,190
It's even worse now.

2726
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:26,930
I think it is!

2727
01:56:27,070 --> 01:56:30,110
I don't remember seeing this calamity on the rock.

2728
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:32,190
And who did this?

2729
01:56:33,730 --> 01:56:35,570
Who pooped all over the rock?

2730
01:56:35,630 --> 01:56:36,850
It's sliding down.

2731
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,380
This is so sad.

2732
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:46,140
It's cuffing season.

2733
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:47,340
And this guy is lonely.

2734
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:52,960
He actually doesn't look too good.

2735
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:53,840
I'm kind of concerned.

2736
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,100
I hope he's alright.

2737
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,920
Maybe he's like...

2738
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,340
Maybe it is molting.

2739
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:01,220
And he's like overly...

2740
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:02,720
He's like plucking and everything.

2741
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,980
Please, I'm eating.

2742
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:07,580
Sorry.

2743
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,600
Welcome to membership.

2744
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:11,420
Thank you!

2745
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:13,980
Oh.

2746
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:21,580
The camera like just barely shifted so that we don't have to see his sad, sad self, you know.

2747
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:24,020
Molding too hard.

2748
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:29,160
Never look up male penguins protecting eggs.

2749
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:31,480
I won't look that up.

2750
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:32,880
Now that you told me to.

2751
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,520
I wish there were chinstrap penguins.

2752
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:39,820
Those are my favorite kinds of penguins.

2753
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,240
The chinstrap.

2754
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:42,300
I saw those in...

2755
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:43,960
I saw those in...

2756
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:46,400
In Antarctica.

2757
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:47,940
But...

2758
01:57:48,820 --> 01:57:49,340
They...

2759
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:49,940
It was...

2760
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:53,160
Every time I went to go see them, the weather was always so terrible.

2761
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:54,660
Javi!

2762
01:57:57,460 --> 01:57:58,300
Or Javi?

2763
01:57:58,620 --> 01:57:59,080
Javi!

2764
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:00,280
Sorry.

2765
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:01,820
Someone said one month already.

2766
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:02,520
OMG.

2767
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:04,280
Thank you for one month.

2768
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:05,180
Thank you.

2769
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:05,940
Thank you.

2770
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:06,280
Thank you.

2771
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:11,140
Look at this guy over here alone.

2772
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,060
Maybe you should try courting him.

2773
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:14,100
There's one up here too.

2774
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:19,280
We saw the chinstrap penguins.

2775
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:20,760
Always on the bad weather.

2776
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:22,540
And then...

2777
01:58:23,900 --> 01:58:24,820
Oh my gosh.

2778
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:27,180
Adele... Adele penguins?

2779
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:27,580
Was it?

2780
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:28,120
Let me check.

2781
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:31,980
Memble.

2782
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,500
We are membles.

2783
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:34,840
Thank you.

2784
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:37,180
Penguins always remind me of my homie Grape-kun.

2785
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:38,340
Yeah.

2786
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:40,140
Grape-kun.

2787
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:42,460
That's funny.

2788
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:44,980
Yeah, his waifu became a Vtuber.

2789
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:46,080
So true.

2790
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:49,040
Starlet Yuki, welcome back.

2791
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:50,140
Excited for the concert.

2792
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:50,700
Thank you.

2793
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:52,500
Thank you so much.

2794
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:58,500
Me and a group of wisps are planning an Antarctica cruise for winter 2024-25.

2795
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,120
Any tips or recommendations?

2796
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:04,300
I don't know.

2797
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,520
I would say...

2798
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,880
Go earlier in the season.

2799
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,200
Because I think that's when it's less crowded.

2800
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:18,120
Like go when it's still like spring into summer in Antarctica.

2801
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:22,760
Because I think it's less crowded then.

2802
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,160
There's less other trips going at that time as well.

2803
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:28,640
So it will be a little bit more secluded.

2804
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:29,760
I think.

2805
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:34,360
Get on a bigger boat.

2806
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:38,760
If you want to avoid seasickness, yes.

2807
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:40,220
Sorry.

2808
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:40,460
Sorry.

2809
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:41,280
Oh my god.

2810
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:44,180
That guy just pooped all over the place.

2811
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,980
No wonder there's streaks on the ground.

2812
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:52,880
Don't do it again.

2813
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:53,880
Don't do it.

2814
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:54,880
Don't do it.

2815
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,440
Don't do it.

2816
01:59:56,540 --> 01:59:58,000
Don't do it.

2817
01:59:58,420 --> 01:59:59,020
No.

2818
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:00,240
Penguin.

2819
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:00,880
No.

2820
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:01,860
Please.

2821
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:03,240
Is he laying down?

2822
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:04,540
Okay.

2823
02:00:04,580 --> 02:00:04,800
Good.

2824
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:06,220
He just laid down.

2825
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:16,200
Primed and ready.

2826
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:21,320
No wonder there's streaks.

2827
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:21,880
There's streaks everywhere.

2828
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:26,140
Penguins are gross.

2829
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,560
They are.

2830
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:29,960
Do it again.

2831
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:30,700
I missed it.

2832
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:31,420
Here I can wind.

2833
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:33,400
I can wind the camera back.

2834
02:00:33,740 --> 02:00:34,180
Wait.

2835
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:35,240
I think I went back too far.

2836
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:35,840
Whoa.

2837
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:37,100
There's even more up here.

2838
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:40,320
Here.

2839
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:40,620
Hold on.

2840
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:41,580
Here.

2841
02:00:41,620 --> 02:00:41,720
Oh.

2842
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:42,040
There.

2843
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:43,160
There it is.

2844
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:48,960
There you go.

2845
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,800
But unless you...

2846
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,260
It depends also on what you want to see.

2847
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:01,740
Because when I went, it was...

2848
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:09,600
The penguins are still looking for places to lay their eggs and start nesting and stuff.

2849
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:12,340
But for...

2850
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:14,700
Later in the season.

2851
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:17,520
You can see the eggs hatch and stuff.

2852
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:19,540
So it really depends on what you want.

2853
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,140
You know?

2854
02:01:27,090 --> 02:01:27,810
You guys.

2855
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:31,950
Poops refuses to elaborate sleeps.

2856
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:34,370
That's the circle of life, baby.

2857
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:36,830
I missed you singing live, but I went...

2858
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:39,230
I wanted to say thank you for singing eyes on me.

2859
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:39,790
It was amazing.

2860
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:40,430
I love your singing.

2861
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:41,370
Thank you, Starfan.

2862
02:01:41,490 --> 02:01:42,270
Thank you so much.

2863
02:01:43,410 --> 02:01:43,810
Fixie.

2864
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:44,630
You welcome to my membership.

2865
02:01:45,390 --> 02:01:46,330
I thought this was a whole video.

2866
02:01:46,350 --> 02:01:46,910
It's a wholesome stream.

2867
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:47,550
It is.

2868
02:01:47,590 --> 02:01:47,930
It is.

2869
02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:48,350
It is.

2870
02:01:48,810 --> 02:01:49,350
Wholesome.

2871
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:49,750
Wholesome.

2872
02:01:49,830 --> 02:01:50,090
Wholesome.

2873
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:51,110
Good dog.

2874
02:01:56,650 --> 02:01:57,590
But yeah.

2875
02:01:57,750 --> 02:02:08,930
If you want a bigger boat, I was saying, bigger boats will help with the seasickness during the Drake Passage, but a smaller boat, the more...

2876
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:13,510
The bigger the boat, the less you can go out on to Antarctica.

2877
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:14,490
So...

2878
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:14,710
Thank you.

2879
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:14,930
Thank you.

2880
02:02:15,190 --> 02:02:15,670
Choo.

2881
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:16,790
Choo.

2882
02:02:17,190 --> 02:02:18,030
Thank you, Murphy.

2883
02:02:19,450 --> 02:02:22,410
I was going to ask how long until she cries over animals being cute.

2884
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:24,210
I wasn't fast enough.

2885
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:27,130
Why is it because I cried over the bird?

2886
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:30,030
Stop judging me.

2887
02:02:30,270 --> 02:02:31,790
I just like animals, okay?

2888
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:34,490
I think animals are very cute.

2889
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:38,170
Is this still the beach?

2890
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:38,850
Yes.

2891
02:02:38,850 --> 02:02:39,490
Come on.

2892
02:02:42,170 --> 02:02:42,850
Shrimp week.

2893
02:02:42,970 --> 02:02:43,450
Shrimp week.

2894
02:02:43,450 --> 02:02:43,890
Shrimp week.

2895
02:02:43,990 --> 02:02:44,470
Shrimp week.

2896
02:02:55,670 --> 02:02:56,670
Love it.

2897
02:02:58,010 --> 02:02:58,510
Cheers.

2898
02:02:59,310 --> 02:02:59,670
Cheers.

2899
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:03,690
I hope she's not tired yet.

2900
02:03:03,870 --> 02:03:04,690
I hope she's not tired.

2901
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:05,730
She's on this.

2902
02:03:05,730 --> 02:03:05,730
Okay,

2903
02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:09,550
whatever.

2904
02:03:09,610 --> 02:03:09,670
She's on a break.

2905
02:03:09,790 --> 02:03:09,870
I'm hope she's not tired.

2906
02:03:09,870 --> 02:03:10,630
She's just enjoying the beach right now.

2907
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:11,350
Choo.

2908
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:14,950
Choo.

2909
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:16,170
Choo.

2910
02:03:16,410 --> 02:03:16,570
Choo.

2911
02:03:16,570 --> 02:03:16,950
Choo.

2912
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:17,310
Choo.

2913
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:17,330
Choo.

2914
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:17,630
Choo.

2915
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:25,050
There's a limited number of people that can go out onto land at a time in Antarctica.

2916
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:31,130
So the bigger the boat, the less opportunities you'll have to go out multiple times.

2917
02:03:31,470 --> 02:03:37,590
Because they will be accommodating more people to go out.

2918
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:45,990
And usually the staff is not so big of people leading people out of the boat.

2919
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:47,070
So...

2920
02:03:50,970 --> 02:03:51,450
Yeah.

2921
02:03:51,450 --> 02:03:53,770
That's why it's probably better to take a smaller boat.

2922
02:03:53,890 --> 02:03:56,150
Even if it's the Drake Passage.

2923
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:57,650
It's not as good.

2924
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:01,010
I corrected myself.

2925
02:04:05,650 --> 02:04:10,670
I am judging and the judgement is on you, cute.

2926
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:17,400
Look here.

2927
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:19,640
Look here.

2928
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,520
I don't need...

2929
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:27,140
I don't need...

2930
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:32,620
I don't need you guys always going around and saying weird things.

2931
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:34,900
And saying things that are not real.

2932
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:37,660
I don't know why I just said real.

2933
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,000
Marriage.

2934
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:48,400
I'm angry that I just said that.

2935
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:00,460
I'm angry.

2936
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:02,700
At the world right now.

2937
02:05:21,910 --> 02:05:22,470
Marriage.

2938
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:34,660
Existence is hard.

2939
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:43,040
I can't even say life is hard.

2940
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:44,040
Because I don't live.

2941
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:45,420
I'm dead.

2942
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,780
I can't even say life is hard.

2943
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:50,340
After life is hard.

2944
02:06:02,220 --> 02:06:03,380
Words are hard.

2945
02:06:03,900 --> 02:06:05,340
And life is hard.

2946
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:11,570
What was I saying?

2947
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:12,270
Yeah.

2948
02:06:12,450 --> 02:06:13,810
Have a fun time in Antarctica.

2949
02:06:14,510 --> 02:06:15,650
Whenever you can go.

2950
02:06:16,310 --> 02:06:17,890
Whoever super chatted before.

2951
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:19,510
About going with the wisps.

2952
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:20,890
Actually...

2953
02:06:20,890 --> 02:06:21,750
Can I come?

2954
02:06:24,370 --> 02:06:25,610
Can I get an invite?

2955
02:06:27,370 --> 02:06:28,970
Because I just want to go back.

2956
02:06:29,930 --> 02:06:30,450
Because I just want to go back.

2957
02:06:33,530 --> 02:06:34,650
I mean, I don't mind.

2958
02:06:34,810 --> 02:06:36,030
I mean...

2959
02:06:43,150 --> 02:06:46,990
I just want to go back.

2960
02:06:47,150 --> 02:06:47,850
It's so awesome.

2961
02:06:52,210 --> 02:06:55,090
Yeah, just stuff me in your suitcase.

2962
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:56,970
I can fit.

2963
02:06:57,150 --> 02:06:58,910
My ectoplasm is moldable.

2964
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:02,090
You can follow in a rowboat.

2965
02:07:03,650 --> 02:07:05,050
She's only half joking.

2966
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:05,890
It's true.

2967
02:07:09,490 --> 02:07:10,410
It's true.

2968
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:11,410
Oh my gosh.

2969
02:07:11,450 --> 02:07:13,550
I just want to go back to Antarctica.

2970
02:07:15,430 --> 02:07:16,490
Go by yourself?

2971
02:07:16,750 --> 02:07:17,450
I'm too scared.

2972
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:20,570
Well, now that I've...

2973
02:07:22,190 --> 02:07:23,210
Now that I've...

2974
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:25,770
I think the scariest part for me was...

2975
02:07:27,530 --> 02:07:28,070
Was...

2976
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:29,710
Flying...

2977
02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:31,570
By myself...

2978
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:31,990
In...

2979
02:07:31,990 --> 02:07:32,070
In...

2980
02:07:32,070 --> 02:07:33,290
One of the countries I've never been before.

2981
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:35,370
And I don't know Spanish.

2982
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:37,910
So I was really nervous about, you know, Argentina.

2983
02:07:38,850 --> 02:07:40,630
I was like, how am I supposed to get around?

2984
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:44,930
If you go, then 2,000 people will follow you.

2985
02:07:45,450 --> 02:07:47,150
We should just get our own boat.

2986
02:07:47,290 --> 02:07:47,910
Okay, everybody.

2987
02:07:48,030 --> 02:07:48,710
We're all gonna...

2988
02:07:48,710 --> 02:07:51,270
We're all gonna book the same trip at the same time.

2989
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:51,710
Okay?

2990
02:07:52,450 --> 02:07:53,610
And we're gonna...

2991
02:07:53,610 --> 02:07:55,170
Share a DM for an invite.

2992
02:07:55,350 --> 02:07:55,750
Thanks.

2993
02:07:55,930 --> 02:07:56,990
Thanks for the invite.

2994
02:07:57,390 --> 02:07:58,210
Yeah, of course.

2995
02:08:00,050 --> 02:08:02,050
Let's all book the same boat at the same time.

2996
02:08:02,050 --> 02:08:04,050
And we'll just...

2997
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:05,890
It'll be the...

2998
02:08:05,890 --> 02:08:07,710
Look at that shark!

2999
02:08:09,670 --> 02:08:10,270
Wow!

3000
02:08:12,270 --> 02:08:14,110
Well, I'll just go in the same one.

3001
02:08:15,790 --> 02:08:17,470
I would genuinely go.

3002
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:22,510
Oh, that would be so fun.

3003
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:24,050
Oh my God.

3004
02:08:24,150 --> 02:08:26,290
It'd be the best trip ever, I think.

3005
02:08:30,590 --> 02:08:32,030
Argentina, I mentioned it.

3006
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,130
Come in!

3007
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:38,970
Giant trip to Antarctica.

3008
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:42,890
Oh my gosh, it's flying!

3009
02:08:43,110 --> 02:08:43,670
Come here!

3010
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:43,870
Come here!

3011
02:08:43,890 --> 02:08:44,310
Come here!

3012
02:08:44,330 --> 02:08:44,630
Come here!

3013
02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:45,190
Come here!

3014
02:08:45,350 --> 02:08:46,230
Come here!

3015
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:46,650
Come here!

3016
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:47,210
Come here!

3017
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:48,090
Come here!

3018
02:08:48,310 --> 02:08:49,090
Come here!

3019
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:50,230
Come here!

3020
02:08:54,570 --> 02:08:56,690
Oh wait, I think he's trying to come here.

3021
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:58,590
I think that's the edge of the tank.

3022
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:02,530
No, we tried!

3023
02:09:05,910 --> 02:09:07,090
Oh, we tried!

3024
02:09:07,230 --> 02:09:08,050
Oh my gosh!

3025
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:09,830
That was the best moment!

3026
02:09:10,690 --> 02:09:12,190
Oh my gosh!

3027
02:09:12,230 --> 02:09:13,330
That was the best moment!

3028
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:17,830
Finally something I'm near to.

3029
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:23,430
He was listening.

3030
02:09:23,690 --> 02:09:26,070
Mamboo ship chartered cruise to Antarctica.

3031
02:09:29,370 --> 02:09:32,150
It's funny because I was even looking it up recently.

3032
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:32,590
It's funny because I was even looking it up recently.

3033
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:33,890
I was like...

3034
02:09:34,590 --> 02:09:35,450
What if?

3035
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:40,410
When I got my tickets, they were...

3036
02:09:41,130 --> 02:09:42,250
50% off?

3037
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:44,450
Or more?

3038
02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:45,190
I can't remember.

3039
02:09:45,890 --> 02:09:48,410
But they were definitely way cheaper than...

3040
02:09:48,410 --> 02:09:51,370
the price that they were on the website when I looked.

3041
02:09:51,470 --> 02:09:52,330
And I was like...

3042
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:53,910
Ugh, paid.

3043
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:56,390
So...

3044
02:09:57,210 --> 02:09:57,730
Hmm...

3045
02:09:58,590 --> 02:10:00,590
And I didn't even...

3046
02:10:00,590 --> 02:10:03,030
I didn't even write that trip off as a tax.

3047
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:04,090
It's like a...

3048
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:06,630
It's like a write off...

3049
02:10:06,630 --> 02:10:07,810
with a tax...

3050
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:08,990
A tax write off?

3051
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:10,570
I didn't even do that.

3052
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:13,750
Even though I guess it technically kind of went for work.

3053
02:10:15,370 --> 02:10:15,890
But...

3054
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:17,230
I just...

3055
02:10:17,230 --> 02:10:18,490
You know...

3056
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:22,750
I misspelled Mamboo ship.

3057
02:10:23,070 --> 02:10:24,110
I misspelled Mamboo ship.

3058
02:10:24,790 --> 02:10:29,010
Curious what your best way to relaxing yourself Curious what your best way to relaxing yourself during con...

3059
02:10:29,010 --> 02:10:32,510
Because I know relaxing myself by playing games is combat.

3060
02:10:32,850 --> 02:10:33,690
During the convention?

3061
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:37,290
During a convention, I'll go find like a...

3062
02:10:37,290 --> 02:10:38,830
panel and I just sit in the back.

3063
02:10:39,030 --> 02:10:39,530
And I just...

3064
02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:42,410
You know, even if it's not something I'm super interested in.

3065
02:10:42,530 --> 02:10:43,250
I'll just kind of...

3066
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:45,290
Sometimes I become interested in it.

3067
02:10:45,790 --> 02:10:46,350
So...

3068
02:10:46,350 --> 02:10:50,170
Like how recently?

3069
02:10:51,270 --> 02:10:51,830
Um...

3070
02:10:53,010 --> 02:10:53,570
Like...

3071
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:55,370
Maybe a couple weeks ago.

3072
02:10:57,930 --> 02:10:59,670
Like maybe like two weeks ago.

3073
02:11:01,090 --> 02:11:01,590
Like maybe like two weeks ago.

3074
02:11:05,610 --> 02:11:06,110
Like maybe like two weeks ago.

3075
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:07,550
How many days did I spend at Antarctica?

3076
02:11:07,750 --> 02:11:09,210
The Drake Passage is many days.

3077
02:11:09,330 --> 02:11:11,350
The Drake Passage was two and a half days.

3078
02:11:12,030 --> 02:11:13,610
And so I was...

3079
02:11:13,610 --> 02:11:14,590
So...

3080
02:11:15,170 --> 02:11:17,310
It was like five days...

3081
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:19,750
On the Drake Passage.

3082
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:21,830
If you count there and going back.

3083
02:11:22,110 --> 02:11:22,490
If you count there and going back.

3084
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:25,370
And then in Antarctica it was about...

3085
02:11:26,270 --> 02:11:26,770
Um...

3086
02:11:28,390 --> 02:11:29,410
Six or seven...

3087
02:11:29,410 --> 02:11:30,250
I think six days.

3088
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:43,040
Sometimes you just need to...

3089
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:44,560
Chill in the backseat of a panel.

3090
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:45,320
Rest your legs.

3091
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:46,000
I know!

3092
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:48,900
Oh my gosh!

3093
02:11:48,980 --> 02:11:50,080
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

3094
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:51,200
Thank you!

3095
02:11:51,980 --> 02:11:53,740
Wait, I hope I said your name right.

3096
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:55,300
I'm really sorry if I didn't.

3097
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:56,560
But thank you so much!

3098
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:58,060
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

3099
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:01,400
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

3100
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:03,900
Um...

3101
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:04,900
How seasick were you?

3102
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:08,300
Not so bad.

3103
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:11,020
I almost threw up once.

3104
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:11,740
But that was it.

3105
02:12:12,940 --> 02:12:13,980
And sometimes...

3106
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:14,820
Um...

3107
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:18,760
Sometimes I would feel a little nauseous.

3108
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:20,180
But I would go outside.

3109
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:22,040
And the cool weather really helped me a lot.

3110
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:23,880
I'm the organizer of that group.

3111
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,380
Of Wisps going to Antarctica.

3112
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:27,920
You are more than welcome to join us.

3113
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:32,780
It is the opportunity.

3114
02:12:32,780 --> 02:12:33,200
Oh my gosh!

3115
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:33,840
You guys have.

3116
02:12:33,940 --> 02:12:34,400
Like actually.

3117
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:37,140
That's so awesome.

3118
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:39,680
I hope you guys have the best time ever.

3119
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:42,100
Bring Mint.

3120
02:12:44,020 --> 02:12:45,100
Mint to go.

3121
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:47,380
Bring Mint somehow.

3122
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,480
Bring my standee.

3123
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:51,460
Or plushie.

3124
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:54,980
Watching this gram stream like this makes me wanna go shout Fish!

3125
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:57,340
Chinango!

3126
02:12:57,640 --> 02:12:59,220
Just like that episode of Rico Rico.

3127
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:40,220
The little fish...

3128
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:41,980
There he is again!

3129
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:43,420
There he is again!

3130
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:46,720
The fish that are like little tube worms.

3131
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:53,260
Is there a jellyfish cam?

3132
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:53,760
There is!

3133
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:54,640
We can go back to it.

3134
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:55,600
We were on it before.

3135
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:57,220
This one's nice.

3136
02:13:58,260 --> 02:13:59,900
Yeah, that's the good stuff.

3137
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:02,140
I'm gonna change the music even.

3138
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:10,340
No, this one's too sad.

3139
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:11,020
No, no.

3140
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:12,220
I want something chill.

3141
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:15,520
There we go.

3142
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:19,340
Lamprey?

3143
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,080
No, not eels.

3144
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:23,300
They hide in the sand.

3145
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:26,100
No, not a lamprey!

3146
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:26,700
Oh my god!

3147
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:32,620
The little cute ones.

3148
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:36,680
That are like... they hide in the sand and then they come out.

3149
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:40,920
I don't know what they're called.

3150
02:14:44,380 --> 02:14:45,300
Thanks for the fish!

3151
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:52,770
Just great!

3152
02:14:52,910 --> 02:14:53,710
Thanks for the vibe gifted!

3153
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:55,650
Chim... Chimpo eels?

3154
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:01,020
No...

3155
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:02,380
They're really small.

3156
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:04,600
And they like always are like together.

3157
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:06,500
Garden eels?

3158
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:07,280
Oh, I think so!

3159
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:09,760
Yes, yes, yes!

3160
02:15:09,860 --> 02:15:10,620
The garden eels!

3161
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:11,420
The garden eels!

3162
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:11,960
Thank you!

3163
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:13,500
Yes, yes.

3164
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:15,900
Um...

3165
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:18,160
They...

3166
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:24,300
When I... I met the voice actress from Rico Rico, Chika Anzai.

3167
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:26,920
And she voices...

3168
02:15:27,980 --> 02:15:29,340
Oh my gosh, my brain.

3169
02:15:32,230 --> 02:15:32,870
Chisato!

3170
02:15:33,070 --> 02:15:34,990
She voices Chisato in Rico Rico.

3171
02:15:35,870 --> 02:15:36,510
And...

3172
02:15:38,810 --> 02:15:40,090
And she...

3173
02:15:40,630 --> 02:15:43,850
I was getting her autograph and she asked me...

3174
02:15:44,630 --> 02:15:45,090
Like...

3175
02:15:45,490 --> 02:15:47,850
She asked me about going to aquariums and stuff.

3176
02:15:48,290 --> 02:15:48,930
Um...

3177
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:50,150
And I was just like...

3178
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:51,790
I was like...

3179
02:15:51,790 --> 02:15:52,910
I wanna...

3180
02:15:52,910 --> 02:15:53,550
Um...

3181
02:15:54,390 --> 02:15:55,490
I wanna go...

3182
02:15:55,490 --> 02:15:55,970
Or...

3183
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:56,730
What did I say?

3184
02:15:56,750 --> 02:15:57,010
Hold on.

3185
02:15:57,050 --> 02:15:57,650
I'm trying to think of it.

3186
02:15:58,230 --> 02:16:01,630
Well, she asked me if I've ever seen the garden eels...

3187
02:16:02,410 --> 02:16:03,770
At an aquarium before.

3188
02:16:04,270 --> 02:16:05,510
And I was like...

3189
02:16:05,510 --> 02:16:07,330
She asked me in Japanese, obviously.

3190
02:16:07,450 --> 02:16:08,310
And I was like...

3191
02:16:09,190 --> 02:16:11,810
Not familiar with what they were called in Japanese.

3192
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:13,370
And...

3193
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:14,310
I was like...

3194
02:16:14,310 --> 02:16:14,630
Huh?

3195
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:17,070
Because we were talking in Japanese before.

3196
02:16:17,930 --> 02:16:18,690
I know!

3197
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:19,390
Chidango!

3198
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:24,890
Shuji asked me about the garden eels.

3199
02:16:25,050 --> 02:16:26,350
And I was like...

3200
02:16:26,350 --> 02:16:26,610
Huh?

3201
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:28,030
Wait, what?

3202
02:16:28,270 --> 02:16:28,870
She was like...

3203
02:16:28,870 --> 02:16:30,610
Have you ever seen them at...

3204
02:16:31,610 --> 02:16:33,270
At an aquarium before?

3205
02:16:33,590 --> 02:16:34,750
And I was like...

3206
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:35,250
Huh?

3207
02:16:35,690 --> 02:16:36,210
Huh?

3208
02:16:36,690 --> 02:16:37,570
And then...

3209
02:16:37,570 --> 02:16:39,650
Eventually, the interpreter...

3210
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:40,770
There.

3211
02:16:40,850 --> 02:16:41,610
She was just like...

3212
02:16:41,610 --> 02:16:43,650
Have you ever seen the garden eels?

3213
02:16:43,670 --> 02:16:44,550
The garden eels.

3214
02:16:44,750 --> 02:16:45,250
I was like...

3215
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:45,610
I don't know.

3216
02:16:46,490 --> 02:16:47,490
And I went...

3217
02:16:50,230 --> 02:16:50,750
Not!

3218
02:16:52,050 --> 02:16:53,050
And like...

3219
02:16:53,050 --> 02:16:54,970
It was so funny I guess because of like...

3220
02:16:54,970 --> 02:16:56,130
How much I was confused.

3221
02:16:56,270 --> 02:16:58,170
And then my reaction to her...

3222
02:16:58,170 --> 02:16:59,610
To her...

3223
02:17:00,310 --> 02:17:00,830
Like...

3224
02:17:00,830 --> 02:17:01,410
Question.

3225
02:17:01,570 --> 02:17:02,390
She like...

3226
02:17:02,390 --> 02:17:03,530
Bust out laughing.

3227
02:17:03,710 --> 02:17:04,690
And it was so cute.

3228
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:05,490
And I was like...

3229
02:17:05,490 --> 02:17:05,950
Oh ho...

3230
02:17:05,950 --> 02:17:06,830
Ehehe...

3231
02:17:06,830 --> 02:17:07,790
Hahaha...

3232
02:17:07,790 --> 02:17:08,510
Woohoo...

3233
02:17:08,510 --> 02:17:11,750
And afterwards, my friends who were waiting for me were like...

3234
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:13,110
Why'd she laugh that much?

3235
02:17:13,710 --> 02:17:14,870
What did you say?

3236
02:17:14,970 --> 02:17:15,230
I don't know.

3237
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:16,270
To make her laugh!

3238
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:18,370
What's your secret, Mint?

3239
02:17:20,270 --> 02:17:21,310
It was so cute.

3240
02:17:22,170 --> 02:17:22,990
She got into it.

3241
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:23,490
It was so cute.

3242
02:17:26,150 --> 02:17:27,990
Did they go to an aquarium in the anime?

3243
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:28,270
Yeah!

3244
02:17:28,350 --> 02:17:29,750
That's why we were talking about it.

3245
02:17:35,650 --> 02:17:37,010
Actually, I'm going to be right back.

3246
02:17:37,090 --> 02:17:38,310
Is that okay if I go get some water?

3247
02:17:38,670 --> 02:17:39,650
You guys go listen.

3248
02:17:39,810 --> 02:17:41,050
Listen to the jellies.

3249
02:17:41,330 --> 02:17:42,410
Listen to the jellies.

3250
02:17:42,590 --> 02:17:44,430
I'll be like really fast because I'm just...

3251
02:17:45,230 --> 02:17:46,510
just getting some more water.

3252
02:17:46,590 --> 02:17:47,310
I'll be right back.

3253
02:19:42,260 --> 02:19:43,220
I lied.

3254
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:44,440
I lied.

3255
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:46,760
I thought it would be quick but I was out of water.

3256
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:53,740
I have a... how do I describe it?

3257
02:19:54,320 --> 02:20:02,480
It's one of those... I put water in and it keeps it warm all day kind of hot water dispensers.

3258
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:05,400
And I forgot to fill it up last time I used it.

3259
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:07,260
And so I was out of water.

3260
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:09,700
But I got a little bit of water.

3261
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:17,600
Delicious water.

3262
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:25,720
Murphy, does your bank ever call you concerned?

3263
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:29,400
Thank you guys for all the superchats!

3264
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:31,600
Murphy, thank you!

3265
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:40,940
Thank you, Kissraptor, thank you!

3266
02:20:41,240 --> 02:20:41,920
Murphy, thank you!

3267
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:42,400
Gliss, thank you!

3268
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:42,880
Murphy, thank you!

3269
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:43,480
Flywraith, thank you!

3270
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:44,760
Thank you, Mervi, thank you!

3271
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:45,800
Thank you.

3272
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:15,360
Thank you, Pikmi.

3273
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:15,800
Thank you.

3274
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:16,680
Murphy, thank you.

3275
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:17,640
Vijay, thank you.

3276
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:18,680
Oh my gosh.

3277
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:19,600
Wait, there's so many!

3278
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:22,020
Thank you, everybody.

3279
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:28,880
Did you ever go to the fishes to ask for some water?

3280
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:31,960
May I drink your bath water?

3281
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:39,860
Hermocrates, thank you!

3282
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:44,120
Yeah, I had to kind of rap it.

3283
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:45,860
Kind of a rap god, even.

3284
02:21:46,660 --> 02:21:47,380
I think.

3285
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:48,180
A little bit.

3286
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,140
They didn't get concerned when somebody bought a bunch of laptops with my eBay.

3287
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:56,420
I'm sorry.

3288
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:00,040
I'm sorry.

3289
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:00,560
I'm sorry.

3290
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:03,780
Baja bla water fudge.

3291
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:06,420
Thank you.

3292
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:09,880
A kaindo.

3293
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:11,340
Thank you for the gift.

3294
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:14,000
I think someone else gifted.

3295
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:14,600
Dog water!

3296
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:15,540
Thank you for the 20 gift!

3297
02:22:15,860 --> 02:22:16,900
Thank you so much.

3298
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:17,440
Thank you.

3299
02:22:17,460 --> 02:22:17,860
Thank you, guys.

3300
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,840
What kind of hot water thingy?

3301
02:22:22,980 --> 02:22:24,120
I kind of want to get one again.

3302
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:26,440
I know Zojirushi has one.

3303
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:27,540
Right?

3304
02:22:29,780 --> 02:22:31,080
Let me look it up.

3305
02:22:32,620 --> 02:22:33,020
Zoji...

3306
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:34,600
Oops.

3307
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:36,480
New window.

3308
02:22:39,880 --> 02:22:40,280
Zojirushi...

3309
02:22:41,980 --> 02:22:43,080
Thermos, I think it's called?

3310
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:44,600
No, not the thermos.

3311
02:22:45,940 --> 02:22:46,660
Water boiler?

3312
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:49,460
Yeah, yeah.

3313
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,640
Are you going to play Ace Combat again after coming back from Japan, right?

3314
02:22:55,940 --> 02:22:56,880
I'm late, by the way.

3315
02:22:57,380 --> 02:23:01,080
Either when I come back from Japan or in August.

3316
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:03,300
One or the other.

3317
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:08,120
Because I just don't want to be interrupted when I'm like, you know...

3318
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:09,920
If I'm playing.

3319
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:12,760
Actually, no, I think I can do it when I come back from Japan.

3320
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:14,540
I think so.

3321
02:23:15,340 --> 02:23:16,000
I think so.

3322
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:19,220
Kind of.

3323
02:23:19,220 --> 02:23:20,560
Thank you for the gift.

3324
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:21,160
Thank you.

3325
02:23:21,740 --> 02:23:25,340
One of my friends is too embarrassed to ask you for a birthday song, so ask for her.

3326
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:27,180
Would you please wish...

3327
02:23:28,360 --> 02:23:28,920
Skele...

3328
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:30,280
Skelemon.

3329
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:31,740
Skelemon, happy birthday.

3330
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:33,460
Of course I can.

3331
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:34,820
Skelemon.

3332
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:36,260
Happy birthday.

3333
02:23:38,620 --> 02:23:41,180
Happy birthday to you.

3334
02:23:41,980 --> 02:23:44,500
Happy birthday to you.

3335
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:48,100
Happy birthday, dear Skelemon.

3336
02:23:50,820 --> 02:23:54,240
Happy birthday to you.

3337
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:58,460
Happy birthday.

3338
02:23:59,320 --> 02:24:02,180
Having a Zojirushi water boiler changed my life.

3339
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:03,140
It's seriously...

3340
02:24:03,140 --> 02:24:05,900
If you drink a lot of hot water stuff like tea or...

3341
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:07,380
Oh my god.

3342
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:08,780
Thank you for the...

3343
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:10,300
Sorry, I'm leaning into the...

3344
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:12,640
I'm leaning into the screen.

3345
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:13,440
Thank you for the bread.

3346
02:24:14,580 --> 02:24:15,340
Thank you for the bread.

3347
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:17,860
Thank you for the bread.

3348
02:24:17,860 --> 02:24:18,540
Thank you.

3349
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:19,520
Yeah.

3350
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:20,240
If you...

3351
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:22,540
If you drink a lot of like tea or hot...

3352
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:23,360
Stuff with hot...

3353
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:24,120
Involving hot water.

3354
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:26,360
Like if you make coffee, I use it when I'm making coffee.

3355
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:29,260
Like it is so awesome.

3356
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:31,400
Zojirushi water boiler.

3357
02:24:31,820 --> 02:24:32,940
It's so good.

3358
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:34,000
So good.

3359
02:24:34,580 --> 02:24:35,980
So, so handy.

3360
02:24:36,140 --> 02:24:38,720
And then it's also like it just keeps warm all day.

3361
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:41,220
It's awesome.

3362
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,720
It's water fun.

3363
02:24:48,820 --> 02:24:49,280
Thank you!

3364
02:24:49,480 --> 02:24:50,780
I'm impressed by your pronunciation.

3365
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,480
Almost no one gets my name right.

3366
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:56,480
I thought it was like a Socrates, so I just, you know...

3367
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:59,120
Looks like Streamlabs is behind.

3368
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:00,300
I know they are!

3369
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:03,480
They're coming through slowly, but surely.

3370
02:25:04,820 --> 02:25:08,460
I'm thinking of streaming after I move back out of my mom's, but it's looking like it'll be a while.

3371
02:25:08,660 --> 02:25:09,560
I might do it anyway.

3372
02:25:09,900 --> 02:25:13,380
When you had a roommate or parent while streaming, what rules did you have?

3373
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:15,840
That's a good question.

3374
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:21,500
I never streamed when I lived with my parents.

3375
02:25:24,060 --> 02:25:27,820
As soon as I could leave, I did.

3376
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:30,200
Thanks for the button!

3377
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:30,720
Thank you!

3378
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:35,440
But with my roommates even...

3379
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:38,020
I think because I streamed in my closet and it was...

3380
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:41,500
on the other side of the...

3381
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:43,160
of the...

3382
02:25:43,380 --> 02:25:45,360
of the house...

3383
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:47,600
from my roommates...

3384
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:50,340
they never really heard me, so...

3385
02:25:50,340 --> 02:25:53,820
I didn't actually have any rules...

3386
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:57,640
Before... Even now, though...

3387
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:05,120
I think... I think because they also stream a little bit...

3388
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:10,660
We kind of just understand that this is just how it is.

3389
02:26:19,010 --> 02:26:19,690
So...

3390
02:26:19,690 --> 02:26:20,890
The live jellycam.

3391
02:26:21,650 --> 02:26:22,690
I know, right?

3392
02:26:22,850 --> 02:26:23,710
Isn't it awesome?

3393
02:26:23,930 --> 02:26:24,590
Streamer House.

3394
02:26:24,910 --> 02:26:25,910
Streamer House Rio.

3395
02:26:26,590 --> 02:26:29,570
Is the MGS episode coming before or after MGS Con?

3396
02:26:29,790 --> 02:26:32,530
I think I have it on the schedule for...

3397
02:26:32,530 --> 02:26:33,070
Let's see.

3398
02:26:34,510 --> 02:26:35,590
What do I say?

3399
02:26:37,470 --> 02:26:39,690
I have it on the schedule for...

3400
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:47,020
After MGS Con.

3401
02:26:48,380 --> 02:26:49,500
After MGS Con.

3402
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:50,540
After MGS Con.

3403
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:52,100
After MGS Con.

3404
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:53,000
I'm so sad right now.

3405
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:53,220
What are we doing now?

3406
02:26:53,220 --> 02:26:54,560
I hope you're okay.

3407
02:26:55,640 --> 02:26:56,460
Stay safe.

3408
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:56,840
Stay safe.

3409
02:26:58,300 --> 02:26:59,360
Here's the list of play.

3410
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:00,640
First By Order...

3411
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:02,040
4-5-0 for story.

3412
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:02,680
We can play...

3413
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:04,540
Air Combat and Ace Combat 2 as your...

3414
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:05,660
first game to dispute...

3415
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:06,660
I'm not having a story.

3416
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:07,720
Skip 3 if you want.

3417
02:27:08,460 --> 02:27:09,540
It's just set in the future.

3418
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:09,740
Ah!

3419
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:10,500
Thank you none.

3420
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:12,140
4-5-0.

3421
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:12,500
Wait.

3422
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:14,160
I've heard to play 0 first though.

3423
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:20,040
näe ee Ehe

3424
02:27:28,190 --> 02:27:28,610
Mmm...

3425
02:27:28,610 --> 02:27:30,030
This combat 4 is so good.

3426
02:27:30,570 --> 02:27:31,650
So much I want to play.

3427
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:35,290
When will Metal Gear Delta come out?

3428
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:38,930
When will Konami contact me about the dates for Metal Gear Delta?

3429
02:28:00,500 --> 02:28:02,600
I'd never play a Zero game first.

3430
02:28:02,760 --> 02:28:03,020
You know what?

3431
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:03,420
That's fair.

3432
02:28:03,660 --> 02:28:04,660
That is so fair.

3433
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:10,960
The chance of playing Ace Combat 7?

3434
02:28:12,820 --> 02:28:14,640
I would like to play it.

3435
02:28:15,020 --> 02:28:16,180
I would like to...

3436
02:28:16,180 --> 02:28:18,620
Actually, I really want to play that again.

3437
02:28:19,080 --> 02:28:20,700
I want to play Ace Combat 7 again.

3438
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:22,900
And I really want to play Metal Gear Rising again.

3439
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:25,300
Because I feel like...

3440
02:28:25,300 --> 02:28:28,280
Even though I've seen some stuff about...

3441
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:31,540
Since Metal Gear Rising wasn't very long...

3442
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:33,840
I can remember a lot about it.

3443
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:36,940
And kind of think back on some scenes and be like...

3444
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:40,080
Oh, now that I know the context for more stuff, I get it.

3445
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:41,620
But I'm like...

3446
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:43,520
But I'm like...

3447
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:44,960
I...

3448
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:46,000
I...

3449
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:48,900
Probably don't remember everything.

3450
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:50,500
So I want to...

3451
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:55,660
Konami, please sponsor.

3452
02:28:56,920 --> 02:28:58,460
I don't think I'm big enough.

3453
02:28:58,820 --> 02:28:59,960
I'm not big enough.

3454
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:00,980
I'm not in a company.

3455
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:06,680
But even in a company too, you're not always guaranteed stuff, huh?

3456
02:29:08,220 --> 02:29:11,180
If I haven't finished Ace Combat 7 story DLC...

3457
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:12,560
Yes, I still have to play that too.

3458
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:15,940
Oh, tomorrow.

3459
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:18,440
Tomorrow, I think I want to play...

3460
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:20,260
Ghost Trick.

3461
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:22,260
So we'll have more of that.

3462
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:31,200
Yeah, I don't know.

3463
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:34,560
I'm still trying to decide my...

3464
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:36,080
I'm still trying to...

3465
02:29:36,760 --> 02:29:39,300
Decide my schedule for...

3466
02:29:39,880 --> 02:29:40,900
For the week.

3467
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:46,340
Still trying to decide my schedule for the week.

3468
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:48,080
I don't know what I want to do yet.

3469
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:51,080
My brain is so...

3470
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:56,560
From this past weekend.

3471
02:29:56,980 --> 02:29:58,420
Especially because...

3472
02:29:58,420 --> 02:29:59,480
I don't know.

3473
02:29:59,780 --> 02:30:01,920
I sleep on a very specific pillow.

3474
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:04,700
When I sleep at a hotel pillow...

3475
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:05,840
Unless it's like...

3476
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:07,960
Like the hotel pillows are just...

3477
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:09,020
They're like...

3478
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:10,160
I don't know.

3479
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:10,880
My hotel...

3480
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:11,960
No, not my hotel.

3481
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:13,380
My pillow is...

3482
02:30:13,380 --> 02:30:14,740
The perfect...

3483
02:30:14,740 --> 02:30:14,960
I'm...

3484
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:16,100
I'm Goldilocks.

3485
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:17,080
It's the perfect...

3486
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:18,360
Bit of...

3487
02:30:18,360 --> 02:30:19,980
Hard and soft.

3488
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:21,300
And...

3489
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:24,600
The hotel pillows are either too hard or too soft.

3490
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:26,080
So I'm just...

3491
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:28,420
Gosh, it was so hard to sleep.

3492
02:30:30,180 --> 02:30:32,720
I also met Chika Anzai at AWA last year.

3493
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:34,420
She signed the back of my Chisato plushie.

3494
02:30:34,840 --> 02:30:35,320
Cute!

3495
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:38,580
Her staff thought I wanted to sign on its pantsu.

3496
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:40,020
She looked at the Takina plushie.

3497
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:42,160
I hadn't asked why she got to wear boxers.

3498
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:43,160
It's canon.

3499
02:30:43,320 --> 02:30:43,960
It is canon!

3500
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:46,940
You're so right.

3501
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:51,620
It doesn't hit the same when it's different.

3502
02:30:56,420 --> 02:30:57,860
The down ones are trash.

3503
02:30:58,080 --> 02:30:58,580
Down pillows?

3504
02:30:58,880 --> 02:30:59,340
Oh my gosh.

3505
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:01,020
They hurt my neck so bad.

3506
02:31:05,590 --> 02:31:07,410
Why are we still at the beach?

3507
02:31:09,430 --> 02:31:10,510
There's nothing here.

3508
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:13,530
Let's see what else.

3509
02:31:13,530 --> 02:31:15,450
Let's go back to aviary cam.

3510
02:31:15,730 --> 02:31:17,350
Oh my gosh.

3511
02:31:17,370 --> 02:31:17,950
Look at them.

3512
02:31:21,250 --> 02:31:22,510
Oh my gosh.

3513
02:31:22,570 --> 02:31:23,230
Look at them.

3514
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:25,270
Look at those little birds.

3515
02:31:25,670 --> 02:31:26,190
Walk.

3516
02:31:27,490 --> 02:31:28,010
Walk.

3517
02:31:28,630 --> 02:31:29,150
Walk.

3518
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:32,070
Walk with your...

3519
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:33,490
Walk with your feet!

3520
02:31:36,070 --> 02:31:38,110
The Kamiyoshi Minty Locks.

3521
02:31:38,250 --> 02:31:39,390
And the three pillows.

3522
02:31:39,950 --> 02:31:41,010
Minty Locks and...

3523
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:42,310
And the three pillows.

3524
02:31:43,830 --> 02:31:45,230
What kind of a pillow is it?

3525
02:31:45,470 --> 02:31:47,130
I think it's just like a memory foam.

3526
02:31:47,390 --> 02:31:47,930
Or foam...

3527
02:31:47,930 --> 02:31:48,390
Kind of foam.

3528
02:31:48,730 --> 02:31:49,430
But it's like...

3529
02:31:49,430 --> 02:31:50,210
Has like one of those...

3530
02:31:50,210 --> 02:31:50,930
It's like one of those...

3531
02:31:50,930 --> 02:31:52,390
Pillows that's like...

3532
02:31:53,090 --> 02:31:54,870
Indented in the certain parts.

3533
02:31:54,930 --> 02:31:56,430
And it makes you...

3534
02:31:56,430 --> 02:31:58,030
Have a good support.

3535
02:32:04,610 --> 02:32:05,630
I need a...

3536
02:32:05,630 --> 02:32:06,990
I need a nice hard pillow.

3537
02:32:09,830 --> 02:32:11,270
Are those sandpipers?

3538
02:32:13,090 --> 02:32:13,970
It says...

3539
02:32:13,970 --> 02:32:14,670
Oh my gosh!

3540
02:32:14,830 --> 02:32:15,330
Look at them go!

3541
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:17,690
It says...

3542
02:32:27,210 --> 02:32:28,290
I don't know.

3543
02:32:28,370 --> 02:32:29,770
I don't think I've seen any of those.

3544
02:32:30,050 --> 02:32:31,790
I think they're too busy blending in.

3545
02:32:32,170 --> 02:32:35,590
Look for leg bands on our birds which helps us identify them.

3546
02:32:36,350 --> 02:32:37,910
Each bird has its own history.

3547
02:32:38,150 --> 02:32:40,430
Most came here injured and can't live in the wild.

3548
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:40,990
What?

3549
02:32:44,750 --> 02:32:46,250
They make firm down pillows?

3550
02:32:47,730 --> 02:32:48,430
I don't think...

3551
02:32:48,430 --> 02:32:49,270
I don't think that's real.

3552
02:32:50,730 --> 02:32:52,710
Kelp forest cam is always refreshing.

3553
02:32:52,970 --> 02:32:53,730
I don't know.

3554
02:32:53,910 --> 02:32:54,170
The...

3555
02:32:54,170 --> 02:32:55,450
That one like...

3556
02:32:55,990 --> 02:32:57,090
Zooms like crazy.

3557
02:32:57,970 --> 02:32:59,630
That one is kind of insane.

3558
02:33:00,210 --> 02:33:01,810
That one is just like...

3559
02:33:02,410 --> 02:33:02,970
Enhance.

3560
02:33:07,070 --> 02:33:07,950
Over here.

3561
02:33:08,230 --> 02:33:09,450
Over here.

3562
02:33:09,450 --> 02:33:09,990
Over here.

3563
02:33:09,990 --> 02:33:10,090
Wow!

3564
02:33:10,230 --> 02:33:11,570
It's dragging you everywhere.

3565
02:33:14,350 --> 02:33:14,830
Oh!

3566
02:33:15,470 --> 02:33:16,230
Look at that!

3567
02:33:17,170 --> 02:33:17,650
Oh!

3568
02:33:17,890 --> 02:33:19,950
This looks like a nice area to live in.

3569
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:24,290
I wish I were a bird.

3570
02:33:26,750 --> 02:33:27,710
Where's the kelp?

3571
02:33:27,710 --> 02:33:28,130
There we go.

3572
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:30,150
Okay.

3573
02:33:30,190 --> 02:33:31,210
You guys ready for whiplash?

3574
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:39,940
I've been to this aquarium over a decade ago.

3575
02:33:40,020 --> 02:33:41,960
I don't remember much but I remember Monter...

3576
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:42,580
Monter...

3577
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:43,980
Monterrey Bay stinks horribly.

3578
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:49,160
Just the bay itself or the aquarium?

3579
02:33:51,370 --> 02:33:54,720
It's probably from all the bird shit everywhere.

3580
02:33:58,950 --> 02:34:00,700
Any zoo live cams?

3581
02:34:01,050 --> 02:34:01,860
I can check.

3582
02:34:02,850 --> 02:34:03,440
Let's see.

3583
02:34:06,380 --> 02:34:07,200
Wait!

3584
02:34:07,480 --> 02:34:08,060
Wait!

3585
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:09,400
Look at him!

3586
02:34:09,820 --> 02:34:12,280
He's spotted like a tiger!

3587
02:34:13,240 --> 02:34:14,400
Leopard seal!

3588
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:16,020
I mean, not seal.

3589
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:16,780
Leopard shark!

3590
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:17,360
Sorry.

3591
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:19,960
Leopard shark!

3592
02:34:20,240 --> 02:34:20,900
Leopard shark!

3593
02:34:24,220 --> 02:34:26,660
I got a little too excited.

3594
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:30,300
Leopard shark!

3595
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:31,520
Leopard shark!

3596
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:32,920
Oh!

3597
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:33,740
They're so cute!

3598
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:35,060
They're so cute!

3599
02:34:35,660 --> 02:34:36,580
Look at those spots.

3600
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:38,840
Oh!

3601
02:34:43,650 --> 02:34:44,370
Wow!

3602
02:34:44,530 --> 02:34:44,970
There's two of them.

3603
02:34:48,110 --> 02:34:48,790
There's fish.

3604
02:34:49,310 --> 02:34:51,430
How do they all co-exist?

3605
02:34:51,830 --> 02:34:52,450
Co-habitat.

3606
02:34:53,630 --> 02:34:54,170
Hiro.

3607
02:34:54,350 --> 02:34:55,450
Hiro, welcome to the membership.

3608
02:34:55,550 --> 02:34:56,050
Thank you!

3609
02:34:58,270 --> 02:35:00,050
The ocean stench.

3610
02:35:00,090 --> 02:35:00,890
Oh, the algae.

3611
02:35:01,230 --> 02:35:03,410
The algae is probably what's making it so stinky.

3612
02:35:05,730 --> 02:35:06,270
Maybe.

3613
02:35:12,510 --> 02:35:13,470
Stinky algae.

3614
02:35:14,410 --> 02:35:17,490
It all like gathers up and then is like...

3615
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:23,850
A leopard seal would be a real fine.

3616
02:35:26,010 --> 02:35:28,250
Leopard seals I think are kind of ugly, right?

3617
02:35:28,330 --> 02:35:29,270
Aren't they the ugly ones?

3618
02:35:31,730 --> 02:35:32,370
Let's see.

3619
02:35:35,950 --> 02:35:38,030
Yeah, they're really ugly.

3620
02:35:40,350 --> 02:35:41,310
They're actually...

3621
02:35:43,730 --> 02:35:44,590
It's the parrot.

3622
02:35:44,690 --> 02:35:45,770
Maybe parrotfish again.

3623
02:35:45,850 --> 02:35:46,530
I'm not quite sure.

3624
02:35:51,410 --> 02:35:52,470
Spotted like a tiger?

3625
02:35:53,190 --> 02:35:54,230
You know what I meant.

3626
02:35:54,510 --> 02:35:55,950
I didn't mean to say tiger.

3627
02:35:56,230 --> 02:35:58,070
I also didn't mean to say leopard seal.

3628
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:58,790
Okay, you guys?

3629
02:35:58,810 --> 02:35:59,270
I'm tired.

3630
02:36:00,830 --> 02:36:02,890
Let me... give me a break.

3631
02:36:07,670 --> 02:36:09,270
This isn't Tantorica anymore.

3632
02:36:09,450 --> 02:36:11,290
Look, when you think of a seal...

3633
02:36:11,910 --> 02:36:13,390
Is this AI generated?

3634
02:36:14,550 --> 02:36:16,010
Okay, I'm not gonna use this.

3635
02:36:16,070 --> 02:36:16,430
It's Adobe.

3636
02:36:16,530 --> 02:36:17,710
It's Adobe stock and I can't tell.

3637
02:36:19,270 --> 02:36:21,390
When you think of a seal...

3638
02:36:24,150 --> 02:36:25,510
You think...

3639
02:36:26,450 --> 02:36:27,410
You think...

3640
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:28,630
Hold on.

3641
02:36:35,640 --> 02:36:36,920
You think cute.

3642
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:39,160
You think like this, right?

3643
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:41,020
You think like...

3644
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:45,000
Look at his little beady eyes.

3645
02:36:45,140 --> 02:36:47,140
Look how sweet he is.

3646
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:48,940
Look how cute.

3647
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:51,020
Look at him.

3648
02:36:51,020 --> 02:36:52,400
He's just a little guy.

3649
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:56,940
If you've never seen a leopard seal before, I'm about to ruin your...

3650
02:36:56,940 --> 02:36:58,880
I'm about to ruin your day.

3651
02:37:01,420 --> 02:37:03,600
You wanna know what a leopard seal looks like?

3652
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:05,720
This.

3653
02:37:10,310 --> 02:37:12,390
This is what a leopard seal...

3654
02:37:12,390 --> 02:37:12,950
It's...

3655
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:18,520
This.

3656
02:37:19,420 --> 02:37:20,020
This.

3657
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:21,400
This.

3658
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:22,940
This.

3659
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:23,380
This.

3660
02:37:25,060 --> 02:37:25,740
This.

3661
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:25,920
This.

3662
02:37:26,140 --> 02:37:28,040
They don't even look...

3663
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:29,500
They look prehistoric.

3664
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,180
They look insane.

3665
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:34,780
Do you know...

3666
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:37,160
Do you know that like scary stories...

3667
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:37,420
Hold on.

3668
02:37:37,460 --> 02:37:40,200
Scary stories to tell in the dark?

3669
02:37:40,720 --> 02:37:41,400
The...

3670
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:42,420
The girl...

3671
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:43,500
The...

3672
02:37:43,500 --> 02:37:45,240
The girl...

3673
02:37:46,120 --> 02:37:47,060
This one.

3674
02:37:48,180 --> 02:37:48,860
Sorry.

3675
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:49,620
Um...

3676
02:37:49,620 --> 02:37:52,240
The pale lady, I think is what she's called.

3677
02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:54,500
I'm about to show a scary image.

3678
02:37:54,760 --> 02:37:55,540
This one.

3679
02:37:55,720 --> 02:37:57,340
That's what they look like to me.

3680
02:37:58,460 --> 02:37:59,400
That's what...

3681
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:00,100
That's what...

3682
02:38:00,100 --> 02:38:03,260
That's what the sea lion looks like to me.

3683
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:11,260
And then they're always covered in blood.

3684
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:12,720
He's perfect.

3685
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:15,760
He's cute though.

3686
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:17,920
I don't know.

3687
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:20,860
They look...

3688
02:38:20,860 --> 02:38:21,940
They look like...

3689
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:23,620
So...

3690
02:38:23,620 --> 02:38:24,860
They look like a...

3691
02:38:24,860 --> 02:38:25,280
A...

3692
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,520
They look so...

3693
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:28,500
Prehistoric is all the...

3694
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:30,100
The only word that comes to my head.

3695
02:38:31,320 --> 02:38:32,440
Like look at this.

3696
02:38:36,150 --> 02:38:37,390
Let's get rid of the lady.

3697
02:38:37,850 --> 02:38:38,650
Look at this.

3698
02:38:41,530 --> 02:38:43,650
That does not look like a seal.

3699
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:45,810
That looks like a monster.

3700
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:48,190
That looks like a dinosaur.

3701
02:38:48,190 --> 02:38:48,470
Dinosaur.

3702
02:38:56,510 --> 02:38:58,510
Mr. Night, welcome to Mambo Show.

3703
02:39:00,970 --> 02:39:03,010
That looks like a dinosaur right there.

3704
02:39:04,090 --> 02:39:05,330
Look so scary.

3705
02:39:06,830 --> 02:39:10,630
Their mouths are so scary because they have so many...

3706
02:39:11,020 --> 02:39:12,390
Like you think of a seal.

3707
02:39:12,530 --> 02:39:13,770
You think...

3708
02:39:13,770 --> 02:39:15,010
You think this.

3709
02:39:15,010 --> 02:39:18,370
We're just like, oh little baby seals.

3710
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:21,350
Look how sweet he is.

3711
02:39:21,410 --> 02:39:23,210
Look how cute that guy is.

3712
02:39:23,430 --> 02:39:24,610
And it's just like BAM!

3713
02:39:30,940 --> 02:39:32,920
Leopard seals are so ugly.

3714
02:39:35,740 --> 02:39:38,440
Okay, this one's actually pretty cute.

3715
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:41,200
Okay, hold on.

3716
02:39:41,260 --> 02:39:42,700
This one I'm about to show.

3717
02:39:47,080 --> 02:39:48,420
This one's pretty cute.

3718
02:39:50,380 --> 02:39:52,100
This one's pretty cute, I think.

3719
02:39:52,420 --> 02:39:52,900
Maybe.

3720
02:39:54,900 --> 02:39:56,320
Elephant seals are the cutest.

3721
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:57,520
Let's see.

3722
02:39:58,160 --> 02:39:59,080
No, they're not.

3723
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:00,780
No, actually they're the worst.

3724
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:02,360
I have seen the elephant seal.

3725
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:06,320
I have seen the elephant seal.

3726
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:08,060
They look like me when I take a selfie.

3727
02:40:09,800 --> 02:40:11,400
Leopard seals look like he goes...

3728
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:15,860
Have you guys ever seen an elephant seal?

3729
02:40:16,100 --> 02:40:18,400
I'm about to ruin your day.

3730
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:21,560
I'm about to ruin your day.

3731
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:25,420
I'm gonna make you wish you'd never seen this creature ever before.

3732
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:29,040
I'm gonna make you think... I love elephants.

3733
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:32,280
No, I'm not gonna make you think that.

3734
02:40:32,680 --> 02:40:35,880
I, personally, Mint Phantom loves elephants.

3735
02:40:36,320 --> 02:40:37,420
But elephant seals?

3736
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:39,500
What the hell is this?

3737
02:40:43,530 --> 02:40:44,170
What?

3738
02:40:47,030 --> 02:40:49,430
What were you thinking, God?

3739
02:40:49,890 --> 02:40:51,130
When you created this thing?

3740
02:40:54,630 --> 02:40:57,010
On Noah's Ark, there were two of these.

3741
02:40:59,050 --> 02:41:00,570
And nobody complained.

3742
02:41:03,890 --> 02:41:07,830
No one said, oh, maybe the elephant seal...

3743
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:11,550
This

3744
02:41:16,660 --> 02:41:18,000
one is terrifying.

3745
02:41:36,500 --> 02:41:38,400
You're so mean!

3746
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I offer elephant seals.

3747
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:47,620
I wouldn't do that.

3748
02:41:47,620 --> 02:41:47,980
You'll be my обрат.

3749
02:41:47,980 --> 02:41:57,920
It's funny because male elephant seals and female elephant seals are literally like video game characters, you know?

3750
02:41:58,100 --> 02:42:00,660
When like the girls are so like...

3751
02:42:00,660 --> 02:42:01,800
Oh la la!

3752
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:04,280
I'm so hot!

3753
02:42:05,800 --> 02:42:11,860
And the guys, they just are like... they just have to be grotesque.

3754
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:13,100
Like that's the male.

3755
02:42:14,360 --> 02:42:15,000
Female.

3756
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:16,280
She's so cute!

3757
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:19,380
Actually kind of looks like a panda.

3758
02:42:19,660 --> 02:42:20,560
Those markings.

3759
02:42:23,540 --> 02:42:25,120
This guy slurps!

3760
02:42:27,340 --> 02:42:29,820
But this one... this guy is kind of cute though.

3761
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:30,620
This one is kind of cute.

3762
02:42:30,980 --> 02:42:31,620
He's cute.

3763
02:42:32,220 --> 02:42:34,000
He's looking... he looks kind of happy.

3764
02:42:34,100 --> 02:42:35,800
He looks like he's got a little bit of a smile.

3765
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:40,760
Okay, I'm gonna show you something else really grotesque.

3766
02:42:41,240 --> 02:42:43,780
Gonna make you wish that you've never seen it before!

3767
02:42:46,780 --> 02:42:49,580
Gonna make you say, please, Minto, stop!

3768
02:42:49,740 --> 02:42:50,720
Put us out of our misery!

3769
02:42:52,100 --> 02:42:53,660
Put us out of our misery, misery!

3770
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:55,920
Uh oh, the misery!

3771
02:42:56,320 --> 02:42:58,620
You wouldn't want to be this guy's enemy!

3772
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:07,660
Doesn't even have teeth.

3773
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:09,520
Oh no, he's got two bottom teeth.

3774
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:11,580
Looks like my grandpa actually.

3775
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:19,720
I never saw an elephant seal.

3776
02:43:20,660 --> 02:43:23,260
I saw a leopard seal and I saw...

3777
02:43:23,260 --> 02:43:25,000
Oh gosh, what are they called?

3778
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:25,360
Hold on.

3779
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:26,260
Types of seals.

3780
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:27,340
Can't remember the name.

3781
02:43:27,640 --> 02:43:28,600
Types of seals.

3782
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:33,600
I saw...

3783
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:38,960
Leopard seal and...

3784
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:41,640
I

3785
02:43:45,310 --> 02:43:46,010
can't remember.

3786
02:43:47,530 --> 02:43:48,210
Can't remember.

3787
02:43:48,650 --> 02:43:49,610
Don't bully him.

3788
02:43:49,870 --> 02:43:51,210
I changed my mind, he's perfect.

3789
02:43:51,950 --> 02:43:53,770
You're just jealous he has a banging nose.

3790
02:43:53,770 --> 02:43:55,130
While you have none.

3791
02:43:57,790 --> 02:43:59,310
How dare you?

3792
02:44:00,570 --> 02:44:01,130
How?

3793
02:44:04,110 --> 02:44:05,490
How dare you?

3794
02:44:06,430 --> 02:44:07,930
How dare you?

3795
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:09,830
How dare you?

3796
02:44:10,090 --> 02:44:11,450
How dare you?

3797
02:44:11,450 --> 02:44:12,230
How dare you?

3798
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:12,830
How dare you?

3799
02:44:12,890 --> 02:44:13,550
I'll let you know.

3800
02:44:14,250 --> 02:44:17,110
That my nose could be as great as this guy's.

3801
02:44:18,230 --> 02:44:19,090
In fact.

3802
02:44:21,090 --> 02:44:22,050
In fact.

3803
02:44:22,110 --> 02:44:22,470
In fact.

3804
02:44:23,390 --> 02:44:24,050
I will!

3805
02:44:25,110 --> 02:44:25,770
I will!

3806
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:36,640
You

3807
02:44:44,630 --> 02:44:47,510
won't catch me without a nose any longer.

3808
02:44:48,730 --> 02:44:50,430
You won't catch me...

3809
02:44:51,050 --> 02:44:52,590
Without a nose any longer.

3810
02:44:53,230 --> 02:44:53,450
Oh!

3811
02:44:54,770 --> 02:44:55,530
Vor!

3812
02:45:10,660 --> 02:45:11,880
Vor Vor Vor!

3813
02:45:11,880 --> 02:45:14,600
War, war, war, war, war, war, war.

3814
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:25,480
Behold...

3815
02:45:27,060 --> 02:45:27,760
My nose.

3816
02:45:32,300 --> 02:45:33,240
It doesn't come off.

3817
02:45:33,360 --> 02:45:34,500
No matter how much I shake it.

3818
02:45:37,980 --> 02:45:40,040
This is how I'm gonna look for the rest of my afterlife.

3819
02:45:41,480 --> 02:45:42,020
Thank you.

3820
02:45:43,940 --> 02:45:44,460
Thank you.

3821
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:47,040
I hope you can't wait to see this picture every stream.

3822
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:49,940
It's never going away.

3823
02:45:53,060 --> 02:45:55,380
This is every... This is... This is everything.

3824
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:57,040
This is everything.

3825
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:02,020
As I'm live in this kelp forest.

3826
02:46:06,510 --> 02:46:07,830
Still don't see it.

3827
02:46:08,370 --> 02:46:09,110
Oh, sorry.

3828
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:09,610
Don't...

3829
02:46:16,690 --> 02:46:18,150
Does this help?

3830
02:46:42,030 --> 02:46:43,030
Who sent that?

3831
02:46:43,890 --> 02:46:44,230
You!

3832
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:47,280
What did you say?

3833
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:52,080
Minto-chan is my saiko ichiban Japanese ohimesama.

3834
02:46:58,820 --> 02:46:59,340
Thank you.

3835
02:46:59,340 --> 02:46:59,560
Domo.

3836
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:03,080
Banger nose mint.

3837
02:47:03,140 --> 02:47:03,600
Thank you.

3838
02:47:09,070 --> 02:47:10,470
That's the picture she chose?

3839
02:47:11,250 --> 02:47:12,370
With the mouth open.

3840
02:47:12,430 --> 02:47:14,790
Does that mean her nostrils are constantly flared up?

3841
02:47:17,710 --> 02:47:18,230
No!

3842
02:47:20,990 --> 02:47:21,510
Um...

3843
02:47:21,510 --> 02:47:22,930
I don't know what that means.

3844
02:47:23,290 --> 02:47:25,490
It means I might have an infection.

3845
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:27,550
Looks honestly...

3846
02:47:28,310 --> 02:47:30,050
It means I might have an infection.

3847
02:47:30,450 --> 02:47:31,110
In my nose.

3848
02:47:31,390 --> 02:47:32,110
I think.

3849
02:47:33,050 --> 02:47:33,650
Oof.

3850
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:34,910
Oof.

3851
02:47:38,370 --> 02:47:40,270
The picture is worth a thousand words.

3852
02:47:40,510 --> 02:47:41,610
Yet zero no's.

3853
02:47:43,390 --> 02:47:45,010
You can't say that, you guys.

3854
02:47:45,090 --> 02:47:45,350
Look.

3855
02:47:45,790 --> 02:47:47,350
It's literally right there.

3856
02:47:52,960 --> 02:47:53,920
My nose.

3857
02:47:55,640 --> 02:47:56,940
Is right here.

3858
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:00,680
See?

3859
02:48:02,620 --> 02:48:04,220
My neck is very long.

3860
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:05,800
And my nose.

3861
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:08,220
Is right here.

3862
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:35,980
TVA septum.

3863
02:48:38,620 --> 02:48:40,540
My oshi is diseased!

3864
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:41,480
It's okay!

3865
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:42,620
I'm...

3866
02:48:42,620 --> 02:48:43,780
I'll go to the doctor.

3867
02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:45,480
And I'll recover.

3868
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:47,200
You guys.

3869
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:50,200
Actually, what if I told you that this was like my real nose job?

3870
02:48:50,200 --> 02:48:51,900
What if I got a nose job?

3871
02:48:51,940 --> 02:48:52,840
What if I got a nose job and I said this is it?

3872
02:48:53,740 --> 02:49:06,120
This is... this is the new minto... mintos... mint... min... min... nose... min... minos... min... minos...

3873
02:49:07,540 --> 02:49:09,080
What if I told you that this was it?

3874
02:49:09,160 --> 02:49:11,620
This was... this was my new look forever.

3875
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:13,780
Is he a pimple?

3876
02:49:14,320 --> 02:49:14,760
No!

3877
02:49:15,720 --> 02:49:16,600
No you don't.

3878
02:49:18,200 --> 02:49:20,720
We would love Mint even if she was an elephant seal.

3879
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:23,220
Where are all my elephant seal vtubers?

3880
02:49:24,280 --> 02:49:25,140
Rise up.

3881
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:30,880
Rise up elephant seal vtubers.

3882
02:49:31,300 --> 02:49:33,960
I want to see long long noses.

3883
02:49:33,980 --> 02:49:36,160
I want to see the longest noses.

3884
02:49:36,160 --> 02:49:39,400
I want to see noses that reach the ground.

3885
02:49:40,280 --> 02:49:44,280
I want to see noses that touch the ground and drag all over.

3886
02:49:44,280 --> 02:49:47,840
Picking up every scent that could ever smell on the ground.

3887
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:52,980
I want you to be always... I want you to be able to throw your nose over your shoulder.

3888
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:58,260
Does your nose hang low?

3889
02:49:58,420 --> 02:50:00,040
Does it wobble to and fro?

3890
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:02,060
Can you tie it in a knot?

3891
02:50:02,100 --> 02:50:03,760
Can you tie it in a bow?

3892
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:12,200
This was a ploy to get you to show nose.

3893
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:13,300
Now it's mine.

3894
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:13,840
Yoink!

3895
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:23,600
Have you guys ever seen that guy that like goes into the Florida Everglades and he's just like, Hey guys, I'm back in the Florida Everglades and I'm walking around barefoot and I'm looking for a 20 foot python.

3896
02:50:23,780 --> 02:50:25,120
Oh, there's a frog.

3897
02:50:25,300 --> 02:50:25,720
Yoink!

3898
02:50:26,680 --> 02:50:28,340
I love watching his videos.

3899
02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:31,940
Does that mean Mint is now open to accepting husband requests?

3900
02:50:32,360 --> 02:50:32,800
Whoa, what?

3901
02:50:34,620 --> 02:50:35,040
Huh?

3902
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:35,460
Huh?

3903
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:36,020
Huh?

3904
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:37,280
Huh?

3905
02:50:38,020 --> 02:50:38,440
Huh?

3906
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:38,860
Huh?

3907
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:41,640
Where did you get this idea from?

3908
02:50:45,780 --> 02:50:46,940
That guy is awesome.

3909
02:50:47,320 --> 02:50:48,380
I love that guy.

3910
02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:50,020
A nose like Ayami's chest.

3911
02:50:50,240 --> 02:50:50,660
Exactly.

3912
02:50:56,040 --> 02:50:57,360
He just grabs everything.

3913
02:50:57,680 --> 02:50:58,100
He does!

3914
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:02,580
If you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm not quite sure about his username, but...

3915
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:05,600
He's some guy.

3916
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:08,420
He goes to the Florida Everglades and sometimes...

3917
02:51:09,360 --> 02:51:13,380
He went somewhere else too before, but he's usually in the Florida Everglades.

3918
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:14,520
And...

3919
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:16,400
He just walks around barefoot.

3920
02:51:16,420 --> 02:51:20,440
His feet are like covered in flies and every bug imaginable.

3921
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:23,300
And he's just like, I'm out here in the Florida Everglades.

3922
02:51:23,420 --> 02:51:24,480
Oh, there's a swamp puppy.

3923
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:28,740
And he looks at the swamp puppy and it's a gator or a crocodile.

3924
02:51:29,680 --> 02:51:34,680
I think the swamp gators or swamp puppies are the gators and crocodiles are...

3925
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:37,320
He calls a crocodile.

3926
02:51:38,180 --> 02:51:40,900
Yeah, he yoinks frogs, lizards, snakes, and pet gators.

3927
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:41,840
He yoinks anything.

3928
02:51:42,320 --> 02:51:43,360
He's just like...

3929
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:45,240
Oh, there's a snake.

3930
02:51:45,580 --> 02:51:46,120
Yoink.

3931
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:48,580
And like the snake will be like...

3932
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:54,020
On his arm and he's just like, this guy's chowing down on me.

3933
02:51:56,340 --> 02:51:57,500
It's so funny.

3934
02:51:58,580 --> 02:52:00,360
I think if you probably search...

3935
02:52:02,860 --> 02:52:04,460
Florida Everglades, yoink.

3936
02:52:04,520 --> 02:52:06,680
I'm almost positive he'll come up.

3937
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:10,740
Florida Everglades, yoink.

3938
02:52:12,380 --> 02:52:13,520
Yoink, yoink.

3939
02:52:14,880 --> 02:52:16,160
I think...

3940
02:52:16,640 --> 02:52:18,120
I think he'll find him.

3941
02:52:19,400 --> 02:52:20,560
Now you're a seal.

3942
02:52:20,760 --> 02:52:22,040
Seals collect husbands.

3943
02:52:23,500 --> 02:52:25,060
But I'm the male seal.

3944
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:27,120
I've got the trunk.

3945
02:52:29,840 --> 02:52:31,220
Can I collect wives?

3946
02:52:33,320 --> 02:52:36,140
Wait, the female seals collect husbands?

3947
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:37,460
Wow.

3948
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:43,500
You would think...

3949
02:52:43,500 --> 02:52:43,860
I don't know.

3950
02:52:45,360 --> 02:52:46,680
Seals seem to be like...

3951
02:52:46,680 --> 02:52:48,340
They just look like they would be territorial.

3952
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:49,480
I don't know why.

3953
02:52:56,220 --> 02:52:57,640
The real Florida man.

3954
02:52:57,840 --> 02:52:58,060
I know.

3955
02:52:58,120 --> 02:52:59,820
High level Florida man.

3956
02:53:00,040 --> 02:53:04,720
That is the best way to call him.

3957
02:53:04,820 --> 02:53:06,020
High level Florida man.

3958
02:53:07,320 --> 02:53:07,800
Yeah.

3959
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,060
He boops the dangerous spiders too.

3960
02:53:16,160 --> 02:53:16,420
I know.

3961
02:53:16,420 --> 02:53:18,480
He's just absolutely crazy.

3962
02:53:19,300 --> 02:53:20,120
He's wild.

3963
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:22,640
But...

3964
02:53:23,740 --> 02:53:24,420
It's fine.

3965
02:53:24,500 --> 02:53:25,500
I like watching his stuff.

3966
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:28,600
Especially because he seems so knowledgeable about each thing.

3967
02:53:28,720 --> 02:53:30,820
Because he'll see something and be like...

3968
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:31,100
Oh.

3969
02:53:31,440 --> 02:53:32,060
That's a...

3970
02:53:33,320 --> 02:53:35,520
That's a Bebop McSpider-do.

3971
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:36,320
Yoink.

3972
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:37,160
And I'm like...

3973
02:53:37,160 --> 02:53:37,300
Whoa.

3974
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:39,380
How did you know that was a Bebop McSpider-do?

3975
02:53:39,940 --> 02:53:40,420
Wow.

3976
02:53:40,580 --> 02:53:41,660
You're so knowledgeable.

3977
02:53:42,580 --> 02:53:45,340
There's a man named Thomas Wedder.

3978
02:53:45,340 --> 02:53:46,140
Slash...

3979
02:53:46,140 --> 02:53:47,080
Wadhouse.

3980
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:52,560
Who had the longest nose of 7.5 inches long.

3981
02:53:52,600 --> 02:53:53,480
I'm looking this guy up.

3982
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:54,460
Thomas...

3983
02:53:56,500 --> 02:53:57,040
Wedder.

3984
02:53:58,560 --> 02:53:59,100
Wood.

3985
02:54:25,280 --> 02:54:26,140
Mint tomato.

3986
02:54:26,140 --> 02:54:27,620
Your nose knows best.

3987
02:54:27,860 --> 02:54:28,520
Thank you.

3988
02:54:33,390 --> 02:54:34,930
Did I miss the otters?

3989
02:54:34,950 --> 02:54:36,690
We can go back to the otters one more time.

3990
02:54:39,050 --> 02:54:39,610
Otter cam.

3991
02:54:39,970 --> 02:54:41,170
Oh, let me get out of the way too.

3992
02:54:41,570 --> 02:54:41,970
Wait.

3993
02:54:42,030 --> 02:54:42,930
All the otters are gone.

3994
02:54:44,870 --> 02:54:45,830
There's no otters here.

3995
02:54:53,010 --> 02:54:54,330
There they are.

3996
02:54:54,570 --> 02:54:54,730
There they are.

3997
02:54:54,730 --> 02:54:55,050
There they are.

3998
02:55:00,180 --> 02:55:00,580
Oh.

3999
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:04,020
They're gone.

4000
02:55:06,820 --> 02:55:07,220
Oh.

4001
02:55:07,380 --> 02:55:09,700
I think I see one swimming under...

4002
02:55:09,700 --> 02:55:10,160
There he is.

4003
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:10,400
Yeah.

4004
02:55:10,460 --> 02:55:11,440
I thought I saw him.

4005
02:55:11,580 --> 02:55:12,460
There he is.

4006
02:55:12,780 --> 02:55:13,340
Gonna get him.

4007
02:55:13,360 --> 02:55:14,040
Get that purple ball.

4008
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:14,560
Nope.

4009
02:55:14,860 --> 02:55:15,820
He's just...

4010
02:55:15,820 --> 02:55:17,080
Looping around.

4011
02:55:17,260 --> 02:55:17,720
He's like...

4012
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:19,620
Solid marine.

4013
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:20,800
Thanks so much.

4014
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:24,320
Just woke up after getting hit with work today and seeing the aquarium.

4015
02:55:24,620 --> 02:55:26,820
This is some peak as fuck content.

4016
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:28,260
Can't wait to see you on Off Guy.

4017
02:55:28,360 --> 02:55:29,060
Thank you.

4018
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:30,260
Thank you.

4019
02:55:30,300 --> 02:55:30,540
Thank you.

4020
02:55:31,800 --> 02:55:32,640
Show us.

4021
02:55:33,820 --> 02:55:34,460
Sorry, guys.

4022
02:55:34,540 --> 02:55:36,160
My chat is super duper delayed.

4023
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:41,340
My chat is so delayed.

4024
02:55:41,480 --> 02:55:43,180
I'm gonna try refreshing YouTube.

4025
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:43,340
Oh.

4026
02:55:44,380 --> 02:55:44,880
Bop,

4027
02:55:50,300 --> 02:55:54,400
bop, bup, bup, ba, ba, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

4028
02:55:57,380 --> 02:55:57,880
Uh.

4029
02:55:58,120 --> 02:55:58,400
Oh.

4030
02:55:58,520 --> 02:55:59,180
Never mind.

4031
02:55:59,260 --> 02:56:00,420
YouTube is stuck.

4032
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:02,500
Uh.

4033
02:56:03,320 --> 02:56:03,800
Uh.

4034
02:56:04,020 --> 02:56:04,520
Refresh.

4035
02:56:05,640 --> 02:56:06,140
Oh.

4036
02:56:06,300 --> 02:56:06,640
Oh.

4037
02:56:06,740 --> 02:56:07,860
I lost chat.

4038
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:09,200
You guys.

4039
02:56:10,520 --> 02:56:13,920
I don't know why YouTube has been so bad lately for me.

4040
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:16,800
I hope it's not like this for anyone else.

4041
02:56:17,200 --> 02:56:17,700
I'll be here, bro.

4042
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:18,740
I'll be right back.

4043
02:56:18,760 --> 02:56:22,860
Because it just keeps, like, always freezing and stuff.

4044
02:56:32,620 --> 02:56:33,740
Bring us back.

4045
02:56:33,900 --> 02:56:34,500
I'm trying.

4046
02:56:34,760 --> 02:56:35,900
I'm looking at you through OBS.

4047
02:56:36,600 --> 02:56:37,380
There you go.

4048
02:56:43,270 --> 02:56:44,050
There you go.

4049
02:56:44,330 --> 02:56:45,630
I think we're good.

4050
02:56:47,830 --> 02:56:48,910
Thank you, thank you.

4051
02:56:49,230 --> 02:56:49,650
Kiss!

4052
02:56:49,910 --> 02:56:50,470
Kiss!

4053
02:56:51,090 --> 02:56:52,650
Oh, thanks, Sideways!

4054
02:56:53,970 --> 02:56:55,650
Your thing finally came up.

4055
02:56:57,470 --> 02:56:59,930
Your thing, your streamlabs finally came up.

4056
02:57:00,710 --> 02:57:02,310
I think we're finally... There's a couple more.

4057
02:57:03,190 --> 02:57:07,050
It's because it has 200 plus trackers, it loads for ages.

4058
02:57:07,670 --> 02:57:08,110
Oh, sorry.

4059
02:57:08,230 --> 02:57:09,250
100 plus trackers.

4060
02:57:09,250 --> 02:57:09,790
What's that mean?

4061
02:57:09,910 --> 02:57:10,770
100 plus trackers.

4062
02:57:11,050 --> 02:57:11,650
Me angry?

4063
02:57:11,750 --> 02:57:12,430
Get it!

4064
02:57:12,430 --> 02:57:13,370
Run while you can.

4065
02:57:14,850 --> 02:57:15,370
Tiara!

4066
02:57:18,130 --> 02:57:19,290
You wanna fight me?

4067
02:57:22,130 --> 02:57:23,490
Spook or bottom right?

4068
02:57:23,690 --> 02:57:24,070
No!

4069
02:57:24,350 --> 02:57:25,690
I mean, I'm a little spooky.

4070
02:57:27,670 --> 02:57:29,370
I have to be spooky.

4071
02:57:30,710 --> 02:57:31,390
I have to be.

4072
02:57:31,470 --> 02:57:32,550
I have to be spooky.

4073
02:57:32,970 --> 02:57:35,430
Someone asked about another zoo cam.

4074
02:57:35,690 --> 02:57:35,970
Let's see.

4075
02:57:36,070 --> 02:57:37,250
Zoo live cam.

4076
02:57:50,170 --> 02:57:51,790
I'm showing you now.

4077
02:57:54,630 --> 02:57:55,190
Pandas!

4078
02:57:55,670 --> 02:57:57,970
Panda, panda, pandas!

4079
02:57:59,650 --> 02:58:01,010
Thank you for hunting us.

4080
02:58:01,650 --> 02:58:03,730
Yeah, you know, I'm just sucking your life force.

4081
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:09,880
Panda babies.

4082
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:11,820
Look at the little baby panda.

4083
02:58:11,980 --> 02:58:12,460
Look at the...

4084
02:58:12,460 --> 02:58:14,660
Oh wait,

4085
02:58:22,830 --> 02:58:24,090
this is live cam highlights.

4086
02:58:24,410 --> 02:58:26,110
No, I want the real thing.

4087
02:58:27,170 --> 02:58:29,130
I want a real live cam.

4088
02:58:29,410 --> 02:58:30,770
I don't want highlights.

4089
02:58:30,890 --> 02:58:32,370
I want to be there.

4090
02:58:32,750 --> 02:58:34,670
Oh my gosh, this is so cute though.

4091
02:58:37,350 --> 02:58:37,830
Oh!

4092
02:58:39,070 --> 02:58:41,350
Even the cameraman was like, this is good.

4093
02:58:41,350 --> 02:58:42,690
This is the good stuff.

4094
02:58:45,730 --> 02:58:47,130
They're so cute.

4095
02:58:50,370 --> 02:58:52,430
I don't want live highlights though.

4096
02:58:52,470 --> 02:58:53,270
I want the real thing.

4097
02:58:54,130 --> 02:58:54,570
Stop.

4098
02:58:54,790 --> 02:58:55,350
I can't.

4099
02:58:55,570 --> 02:58:56,330
It's so cute.

4100
02:58:56,610 --> 02:58:56,830
Okay.

4101
02:58:57,490 --> 02:58:58,370
Oh my goodness.

4102
02:58:58,670 --> 02:58:59,170
Oh my goodness.

4103
02:58:59,290 --> 02:58:59,750
Oh my goodness.

4104
02:59:00,090 --> 02:59:01,750
Oh wait,

4105
02:59:04,870 --> 02:59:05,830
I think San Diego Zoo.

4106
02:59:05,890 --> 02:59:06,990
I've seen these ones before too.

4107
02:59:08,430 --> 02:59:08,870
Oh!

4108
02:59:08,990 --> 02:59:10,090
Oh my God, you guys.

4109
02:59:10,090 --> 02:59:12,210
Guys, we can actually watch people.

4110
02:59:12,650 --> 02:59:14,030
There's a guy in the corner.

4111
02:59:14,270 --> 02:59:15,350
Hey, who are you?

4112
02:59:16,130 --> 02:59:17,410
What are you pointing at?

4113
02:59:18,710 --> 02:59:19,870
What are you pointing at?

4114
02:59:20,070 --> 02:59:20,190
Oh!

4115
02:59:20,510 --> 02:59:21,310
Get your picture.

4116
02:59:21,390 --> 02:59:22,110
Don't drop your phone.

4117
02:59:22,530 --> 02:59:23,830
Don't drop it in there.

4118
02:59:27,530 --> 02:59:28,730
Who is this guy?

4119
02:59:30,210 --> 02:59:31,030
There they are!

4120
02:59:31,130 --> 02:59:31,630
There's the...

4121
02:59:31,630 --> 02:59:33,550
Oh, he was pointing at the red pandas.

4122
02:59:33,550 --> 02:59:33,870
Oh!

4123
02:59:41,230 --> 02:59:42,030
Kvart, thank you.

4124
02:59:42,250 --> 02:59:47,530
The more you talk about Top Gun, the more you make me want to buy the Top Gun Transformers crossover figure.

4125
02:59:48,930 --> 02:59:52,640
What is that?

4126
02:59:56,680 --> 02:59:58,300
I don't think you're getting the shot, buddy.

4127
02:59:58,360 --> 02:59:59,460
I think that panda is gone.

4128
03:00:01,620 --> 03:00:03,080
I think that red panda is gone!

4129
03:00:10,780 --> 03:00:11,560
He's like, dang.

4130
03:00:11,740 --> 03:00:13,320
I couldn't even get the shot.

4131
03:00:13,580 --> 03:00:14,220
Oh my god.

4132
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:14,700
He's laughing.

4133
03:00:14,740 --> 03:00:15,580
He's like, yeah, yeah.

4134
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:16,420
I saw the panda.

4135
03:00:16,960 --> 03:00:17,400
Yeah.

4136
03:00:18,020 --> 03:00:18,460
Yeah.

4137
03:00:18,780 --> 03:00:19,380
You know.

4138
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:21,300
It's more...

4139
03:00:21,300 --> 03:00:23,600
Actually, it's more orange than red.

4140
03:00:24,400 --> 03:00:25,560
You know, but...

4141
03:00:28,880 --> 03:00:30,080
It's behind the sticks.

4142
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:32,320
I don't even see it over here.

4143
03:00:32,740 --> 03:00:33,940
I think it's gone, gone.

4144
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:37,300
Show me the red pandas.

4145
03:00:40,820 --> 03:00:41,920
Hold on one second.

4146
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:43,780
Sorry, I couldn't make it disappear again.

4147
03:00:44,800 --> 03:00:46,880
Let's see what live cams they have here.

4148
03:00:48,400 --> 03:00:49,440
You guys.

4149
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:51,720
Tiger cam.

4150
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:54,440
Oh.

4151
03:00:57,300 --> 03:00:57,940
Wow.

4152
03:01:06,980 --> 03:01:07,940
Baboon cam.

4153
03:01:11,340 --> 03:01:12,760
Are those the baboons right there?

4154
03:01:13,800 --> 03:01:14,780
I think so.

4155
03:01:19,920 --> 03:01:21,100
Oh my god.

4156
03:01:23,020 --> 03:01:26,300
There's someone in the chat that is really upset about this.

4157
03:01:26,560 --> 03:01:27,820
Let me show you guys.

4158
03:01:29,580 --> 03:01:31,080
Look at the live chat.

4159
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:34,960
No monkey.

4160
03:01:35,100 --> 03:01:35,700
No monkey.

4161
03:01:35,780 --> 03:01:36,500
No monkey!

4162
03:01:40,880 --> 03:01:41,900
No monkey!

4163
03:01:42,120 --> 03:01:43,020
No monkey!

4164
03:01:43,240 --> 03:01:43,500
No monkey!

4165
03:01:43,500 --> 03:01:44,420
No monkey!

4166
03:01:44,740 --> 03:01:45,820
No monkey!

4167
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:46,420
No monkey!

4168
03:01:48,540 --> 03:01:52,220
Oh my gosh, they should not go to the Tiger Cam.

4169
03:01:52,440 --> 03:01:54,100
Oh my god, they're gonna lose their minds.

4170
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:55,660
There's monkeys here!

4171
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:03,120
Monkey in the bottom right!

4172
03:02:04,660 --> 03:02:06,580
Hold on, I can entertain them.

4173
03:02:07,140 --> 03:02:08,700
Mute time, come to my stream!

4174
03:02:18,780 --> 03:02:19,720
Somebody help!

4175
03:02:20,540 --> 03:02:24,020
I've fallen in the monkey pit and I can't get out!

4176
03:02:24,580 --> 03:02:26,200
Oh my god, I've lost all...

4177
03:02:26,200 --> 03:02:27,540
There's a bird next to me!

4178
03:02:28,860 --> 03:02:30,820
I've lost all use of my legs!

4179
03:02:31,620 --> 03:02:34,000
Please, somebody help me out of the monkey cage!

4180
03:02:34,680 --> 03:02:38,000
Oh my god, I'm just a baby in the monkey cage, please.

4181
03:02:40,040 --> 03:02:41,920
Oh my god, oh my god.

4182
03:02:42,180 --> 03:02:44,680
Oh my god, I hope no monkeys come down here.

4183
03:02:45,560 --> 03:02:47,460
Oh no, oh my god.

4184
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:50,500
I'm just... I'm just...

4185
03:02:50,920 --> 03:02:51,860
I'm just in the...

4186
03:02:51,860 --> 03:02:54,000
I'm a ghost in the monkey cage.

4187
03:02:54,020 --> 03:02:55,360
Monkey... what is that on the ground?

4188
03:02:56,600 --> 03:02:58,300
What is that right next to me?

4189
03:03:00,060 --> 03:03:01,100
Is it a bird?

4190
03:03:01,460 --> 03:03:02,560
Is it a monkey?

4191
03:03:03,280 --> 03:03:04,180
I don't know.

4192
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:06,840
The baboons don't want to do anything though.

4193
03:03:07,720 --> 03:03:08,600
Mint, no!

4194
03:03:08,860 --> 03:03:10,060
It's happening again!

4195
03:03:10,580 --> 03:03:13,480
The baby's blood dropped in the monkey cage!

4196
03:03:17,160 --> 03:03:19,320
They're gonna let these bloons escape!

4197
03:03:20,180 --> 03:03:20,900
Handle it!

4198
03:03:26,340 --> 03:03:26,900
Okay.

4199
03:03:27,920 --> 03:03:29,440
I thought I could tempt them.

4200
03:03:31,920 --> 03:03:33,260
I thought I could tempt...

4201
03:03:33,260 --> 03:03:33,400
Whoa.

4202
03:03:34,760 --> 03:03:38,120
Oh my god, I'm breakdancing in the monkey cage!

4203
03:03:39,540 --> 03:03:42,900
Oh my god, I can't stop breakdancing in the monkey cage!

4204
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:45,500
Oh my god, please, somebody.

4205
03:03:45,620 --> 03:03:48,240
I just can't stop breakdancing in the monkey cage!

4206
03:03:49,800 --> 03:03:51,360
Oh my god!

4207
03:03:51,360 --> 03:03:52,180
Oh my god!

4208
03:03:52,180 --> 03:03:54,340
This is not good!

4209
03:03:54,580 --> 03:03:55,740
This is not good!

4210
03:03:56,140 --> 03:03:56,920
Don't laugh!

4211
03:03:57,220 --> 03:03:57,940
Other way!

4212
03:03:58,640 --> 03:03:58,920
No!

4213
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:06,560
Okay.

4214
03:04:08,140 --> 03:04:08,700
Whoa.

4215
03:04:09,800 --> 03:04:10,640
My bad.

4216
03:04:10,820 --> 03:04:11,140
Okay.

4217
03:04:11,600 --> 03:04:12,660
I think we're good.

4218
03:04:16,270 --> 03:04:16,830
Okay.

4219
03:04:17,730 --> 03:04:18,290
Okay.

4220
03:04:18,610 --> 03:04:19,390
I think...

4221
03:04:27,670 --> 03:04:29,750
I don't think these guys are gonna do anything.

4222
03:04:31,450 --> 03:04:32,710
Let's go to...

4223
03:04:33,370 --> 03:04:35,010
the live ape cam.

4224
03:04:39,070 --> 03:04:41,590
This is the experience I wanted.

4225
03:04:41,830 --> 03:04:42,890
No highlights.

4226
03:04:43,490 --> 03:04:44,570
Full disappointment.

4227
03:04:45,430 --> 03:04:48,550
I don't want to go to the live cam and say there's nothing here.

4228
03:04:48,810 --> 03:04:49,830
Nothing here.

4229
03:04:50,250 --> 03:04:51,090
No monkey!

4230
03:04:51,250 --> 03:04:51,830
No monkey!

4231
03:04:51,890 --> 03:04:52,510
No monkey!

4232
03:04:52,690 --> 03:04:53,670
No monkey!

4233
03:04:53,710 --> 03:04:54,370
No monkey!

4234
03:04:54,370 --> 03:04:55,710
No monkey!

4235
03:04:56,490 --> 03:04:57,010
No monkey!

4236
03:04:57,050 --> 03:04:57,170
No monkey!

4237
03:04:57,170 --> 03:04:57,590
No monkey!

4238
03:04:59,330 --> 03:05:00,970
Let's try the polar bear cam.

4239
03:05:01,670 --> 03:05:02,590
Oh my god.

4240
03:05:02,730 --> 03:05:03,330
This is the...

4241
03:05:03,330 --> 03:05:04,970
Is that the polar bear right there?

4242
03:05:05,710 --> 03:05:06,830
It looks like a turtle!

4243
03:05:08,790 --> 03:05:09,610
No monkey!

4244
03:05:09,730 --> 03:05:10,250
No monkey!

4245
03:05:10,310 --> 03:05:10,810
No monkey!

4246
03:05:14,770 --> 03:05:15,650
No monkey!

4247
03:05:15,690 --> 03:05:16,130
No monkey!

4248
03:05:16,170 --> 03:05:16,610
No monkey!

4249
03:05:21,030 --> 03:05:22,930
These ones streamed a year ago.

4250
03:05:24,910 --> 03:05:26,770
These ones are from a long time ago.

4251
03:05:27,170 --> 03:05:30,170
We could go into the past and see the monkeys of the past.

4252
03:05:34,010 --> 03:05:34,910
Giraffe cam.

4253
03:05:35,150 --> 03:05:37,950
Oh my god.

4254
03:05:38,130 --> 03:05:38,690
Wow!

4255
03:05:39,910 --> 03:05:40,470
Wow!

4256
03:05:43,010 --> 03:05:44,670
Look at the birds walking!

4257
03:05:47,290 --> 03:05:48,450
Oh my god.

4258
03:05:49,670 --> 03:05:50,790
The bison...

4259
03:05:50,790 --> 03:05:52,130
Those are not bison.

4260
03:05:52,290 --> 03:05:52,910
What are these called?

4261
03:05:53,070 --> 03:05:53,590
I don't remember.

4262
03:05:53,970 --> 03:05:57,390
I haven't seen the new Planet of the Apes yet.

4263
03:05:57,410 --> 03:05:57,830
But...

4264
03:05:57,830 --> 03:05:59,190
Now I can't help but...

4265
03:05:59,190 --> 03:06:01,750
Imagine Mint break dancing in the middle of it.

4266
03:06:03,510 --> 03:06:05,250
Where are the giraffes?

4267
03:06:05,470 --> 03:06:06,710
Okay, I'm going to skip forward.

4268
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:11,960
Giraffes?

4269
03:06:12,660 --> 03:06:13,140
Giraffes?

4270
03:06:15,260 --> 03:06:17,080
There's a comment in the live chat.

4271
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:19,120
It just says, why are they standing?

4272
03:06:20,560 --> 03:06:21,360
I don't know.

4273
03:06:23,620 --> 03:06:25,400
Also, why are they frozen in time?

4274
03:06:26,760 --> 03:06:27,920
Maybe that's what he meant.

4275
03:06:28,320 --> 03:06:29,840
Why are they frozen in time?

4276
03:06:32,400 --> 03:06:33,460
Why are they standing?

4277
03:06:43,260 --> 03:06:44,220
Oh, gazelles?

4278
03:06:44,340 --> 03:06:45,120
Is that what those are?

4279
03:06:50,240 --> 03:06:50,720
Rhino?

4280
03:06:50,920 --> 03:06:52,080
I didn't see any rhino.

4281
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:54,160
Maybe I wasn't looking for them.

4282
03:06:56,300 --> 03:06:57,180
No monkey.

4283
03:06:57,280 --> 03:06:57,740
No monkey.

4284
03:06:57,800 --> 03:06:58,280
No monkey.

4285
03:06:59,120 --> 03:07:00,040
No monkey.

4286
03:07:00,540 --> 03:07:00,940
No monkey.

4287
03:07:01,060 --> 03:07:01,180
No monkey.

4288
03:07:01,180 --> 03:07:01,480
No tiger.

4289
03:07:02,220 --> 03:07:03,140
No nothing.

4290
03:07:04,500 --> 03:07:05,740
San Diego Zoo.

4291
03:07:06,740 --> 03:07:07,880
What's going on?

4292
03:07:08,860 --> 03:07:09,340
What's going on?

4293
03:07:09,360 --> 03:07:10,980
Oh my goodness.

4294
03:07:11,320 --> 03:07:12,740
Little guy asleep.

4295
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:15,340
Little guy asleep.

4296
03:07:15,460 --> 03:07:17,580
Why are they standing there menacingly?

4297
03:07:19,420 --> 03:07:20,480
Pizza mozzarella.

4298
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:21,780
Welcome to membership.

4299
03:07:21,940 --> 03:07:22,420
Thank you.

4300
03:07:23,400 --> 03:07:24,380
Red Panda.

4301
03:07:25,640 --> 03:07:28,660
We're watching Red Panda at 2 frames per second.

4302
03:07:29,220 --> 03:07:30,200
I love it.

4303
03:07:33,040 --> 03:07:33,640
144p.

4304
03:07:33,720 --> 03:07:34,160
Let's go.

4305
03:07:34,300 --> 03:07:34,760
Let's see.

4306
03:07:34,820 --> 03:07:35,680
What is that actually?

4307
03:07:37,080 --> 03:07:38,280
It's 480p.

4308
03:07:38,320 --> 03:07:39,120
Thank you very much.

4309
03:07:42,540 --> 03:07:43,720
Stop motion panda.

4310
03:07:45,220 --> 03:07:46,580
It kind of hurts my eyes.

4311
03:07:50,080 --> 03:07:50,700
Well, guys.

4312
03:07:50,740 --> 03:07:53,300
I have one last thing I want to check before I head out.

4313
03:07:57,480 --> 03:07:59,940
One thing I want to check before I head out.

4314
03:08:01,220 --> 03:08:02,460
And that is...

4315
03:08:05,180 --> 03:08:05,980
That is...

4316
03:08:06,760 --> 03:08:07,160
Jajangm.

4317
03:08:07,560 --> 03:08:08,960
Can we see Fuji-san today?

4318
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:09,100
Yeah.

4319
03:08:09,100 --> 03:08:10,480
Okay, let's find out!

4320
03:08:21,500 --> 03:08:23,960
Can we see Fuji-san today, please?

4321
03:08:24,500 --> 03:08:25,060
Please!

4322
03:08:28,120 --> 03:08:30,500
I guess we can't see Fuji-san today.

4323
03:08:30,880 --> 03:08:32,340
I thought I couldn't reload it.

4324
03:08:37,060 --> 03:08:38,940
No Fuji-san today.

4325
03:08:39,440 --> 03:08:40,000
Unfortunately.

4326
03:08:41,400 --> 03:08:43,100
Let's see if we go back to like...

4327
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:46,140
Oh!

4328
03:08:47,110 --> 03:08:48,380
This morning!

4329
03:08:50,750 --> 03:08:51,920
Oh my god!

4330
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:53,760
Wow!

4331
03:08:55,080 --> 03:08:57,040
It's so beautiful.

4332
03:08:57,680 --> 03:08:59,220
Fuji-san...

4333
03:08:59,220 --> 03:09:00,420
A couple hours ago.

4334
03:09:00,800 --> 03:09:04,300
Fuji-san at the break of dawn.

4335
03:09:10,110 --> 03:09:10,860
Come on.

4336
03:09:12,380 --> 03:09:13,760
Come on!

4337
03:09:17,860 --> 03:09:19,540
It's a little broken.

4338
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:21,860
That's okay.

4339
03:09:24,260 --> 03:09:25,300
That's okay.

4340
03:09:29,160 --> 03:09:29,920
There we go.

4341
03:09:33,440 --> 03:09:37,580
This is my favorite Fuji-san cam to watch.

4342
03:09:38,640 --> 03:09:40,680
There's also another one that I really like too.

4343
03:09:41,220 --> 03:09:43,300
But I feel like this one gets the best...

4344
03:09:44,020 --> 03:09:44,820
What's the word?

4345
03:09:45,720 --> 03:09:46,580
The best...

4346
03:09:47,270 --> 03:09:47,920
Good visual?

4347
03:09:48,100 --> 03:09:48,680
Good idea?

4348
03:09:48,820 --> 03:09:49,800
If it's...

4349
03:09:51,360 --> 03:09:53,240
If it's viewable?

4350
03:09:53,800 --> 03:09:55,560
But I don't see the other one actually.

4351
03:09:56,780 --> 03:09:57,700
It's not that one.

4352
03:09:57,800 --> 03:09:59,080
It's one from a street.

4353
03:09:59,840 --> 03:10:00,500
From a highway.

4354
03:10:00,580 --> 03:10:01,780
I also like looking at this one too.

4355
03:10:02,240 --> 03:10:02,640
Wow!

4356
03:10:05,220 --> 03:10:06,520
Oh my god.

4357
03:10:09,510 --> 03:10:12,130
Actually I have a recording from this one.

4358
03:10:12,190 --> 03:10:13,570
Because it was so pretty one morning.

4359
03:10:14,310 --> 03:10:15,130
I'm gonna cry.

4360
03:10:16,370 --> 03:10:17,370
Yeah, best perspective.

4361
03:10:17,850 --> 03:10:19,550
There's another one though that's from the road.

4362
03:10:19,650 --> 03:10:20,910
That I really like a lot too.

4363
03:10:21,170 --> 03:10:21,650
Like it's from...

4364
03:10:21,650 --> 03:10:22,470
You can see a highway.

4365
03:10:22,630 --> 03:10:24,870
And you can see kind of the lakes and everything too.

4366
03:10:25,150 --> 03:10:26,150
So it's really nice.

4367
03:10:26,630 --> 03:10:28,130
This one's so nice too though.

4368
03:10:29,890 --> 03:10:31,610
Wow, all these normies out.

4369
03:10:31,810 --> 03:10:32,450
Taking pictures.

4370
03:10:32,890 --> 03:10:34,030
Look at all the couples.

4371
03:10:34,190 --> 03:10:34,870
Holy cow.

4372
03:10:36,470 --> 03:10:36,950
Couple...

4373
03:10:37,510 --> 03:10:38,470
Maybe couple.

4374
03:10:39,290 --> 03:10:39,770
Wow.

4375
03:10:43,890 --> 03:10:44,570
Oh yeah!

4376
03:10:44,710 --> 03:10:45,070
Wait.

4377
03:10:45,670 --> 03:10:46,730
They're getting a picture?

4378
03:10:46,890 --> 03:10:47,270
I don't know.

4379
03:10:48,230 --> 03:10:48,710
Wow.

4380
03:10:49,510 --> 03:10:50,450
Gross couples.

4381
03:10:51,650 --> 03:10:52,630
I don't know why this one's not so great.

4382
03:10:53,070 --> 03:10:55,550
But if you go back in time when there's nobody...

4383
03:11:06,740 --> 03:11:08,760
YouTube is giving me such trouble all the time.

4384
03:11:09,960 --> 03:11:10,900
How is it recording?

4385
03:11:11,060 --> 03:11:12,460
It looks like it came from the 90s.

4386
03:11:12,460 --> 03:11:12,900
It's true.

4387
03:11:13,020 --> 03:11:14,480
It really does look like it came from...

4388
03:11:14,480 --> 03:11:16,140
The quality on it is so bad.

4389
03:11:17,380 --> 03:11:18,100
It says...

4390
03:11:18,100 --> 03:11:18,600
Wow!

4391
03:11:18,720 --> 03:11:19,760
There's a 4K.

4392
03:11:20,520 --> 03:11:21,240
No way.

4393
03:11:24,520 --> 03:11:25,180
No way.

4394
03:11:27,500 --> 03:11:28,160
This is...

4395
03:11:28,160 --> 03:11:29,720
This is it in 4K.

4396
03:11:32,560 --> 03:11:33,460
This is it.

4397
03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:34,000
This is...

4398
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:35,540
This is Fujisan in 4K.

4399
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:45,580
It doesn't even load.

4400
03:11:45,820 --> 03:11:46,620
Oh my goodness.

4401
03:11:48,180 --> 03:11:49,200
Doesn't even load.

4402
03:11:50,060 --> 03:11:50,600
Anyway.

4403
03:11:51,400 --> 03:11:53,520
Well, we kind of saw Fujisan today.

4404
03:11:53,740 --> 03:11:56,120
So, that's a win in my book.

4405
03:11:57,540 --> 03:12:00,880
That is a win in my book, baby.

4406
03:12:01,380 --> 03:12:01,560
That is a win in my book, baby.

4407
03:12:01,740 --> 03:12:03,320
That is a win in my book, baby.

4408
03:12:03,340 --> 03:12:03,760
That is a win in my book, baby.

4409
03:12:03,760 --> 03:12:04,760
Give me a second.

4410
03:12:06,960 --> 03:12:07,100
This is broken.

4411
03:12:07,180 --> 03:12:07,940
It is broken.

4412
03:12:09,780 --> 03:12:12,240
Would you do an MGS Zatsu with other indie YouTubers?

4413
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:15,020
Or some who are possibly talking about doing it?

4414
03:12:15,180 --> 03:12:15,880
Oh yeah!

4415
03:12:16,080 --> 03:12:18,980
I've thought about doing something like that before actually.

4416
03:12:19,200 --> 03:12:19,580
So...

4417
03:12:20,260 --> 03:12:22,080
Yeah, I'd totally be down for it.

4418
03:12:25,260 --> 03:12:25,700
Oh!

4419
03:12:25,700 --> 03:12:26,300
Where am I?

4420
03:12:26,500 --> 03:12:27,140
Oh, here.

4421
03:12:28,640 --> 03:12:29,280
My bad.

4422
03:12:29,960 --> 03:12:31,040
Thank you for the chill stream.

4423
03:12:31,160 --> 03:12:31,540
Thank you!

4424
03:12:31,680 --> 03:12:33,380
Thank you guys for just hanging out with me.

4425
03:12:33,380 --> 03:12:40,880
Thanks for letting me just kind of be a little silly and watch live cams and talk about Anime Central and kind of whatever and whatever.

4426
03:12:42,660 --> 03:12:43,140
So...

4427
03:12:44,720 --> 03:12:45,660
Barbecue's still going.

4428
03:12:45,820 --> 03:12:46,120
Yeah!

4429
03:12:47,100 --> 03:12:47,800
You know.

4430
03:12:48,220 --> 03:12:51,400
It's like a really hit attraction at the maid cafe.

4431
03:12:52,420 --> 03:12:53,060
You know?

4432
03:12:54,220 --> 03:12:55,400
It was chill.

4433
03:12:55,620 --> 03:12:56,140
I'm glad!

4434
03:12:56,280 --> 03:12:57,100
I'm glad that...

4435
03:12:57,100 --> 03:12:57,840
I hope you guys had fun.

4436
03:12:58,680 --> 03:12:59,760
I hope you...

4437
03:12:59,760 --> 03:13:03,200
I hope my brain wasn't too silly.

4438
03:13:03,380 --> 03:13:04,780
for... for...

4439
03:13:05,380 --> 03:13:06,680
for listening.

4440
03:13:08,360 --> 03:13:10,720
Because my brain tends to be so silly.

4441
03:13:11,640 --> 03:13:12,160
So...

4442
03:13:13,180 --> 03:13:16,400
Hopefully it was okay to listen to.

4443
03:13:17,860 --> 03:13:19,360
I'll try and get more sleep tonight.

4444
03:13:19,460 --> 03:13:21,380
I got a lot of sleep last night actually.

4445
03:13:21,460 --> 03:13:22,420
But I think it's just...

4446
03:13:22,420 --> 03:13:27,740
It was my first time getting a good amount of sleep in the past couple of days.

4447
03:13:27,900 --> 03:13:28,420
So...

4448
03:13:28,960 --> 03:13:30,100
It was perfect!

4449
03:13:31,120 --> 03:13:32,220
The stream was great.

4450
03:13:33,380 --> 03:13:34,980
I needed a chill stream like this today.

4451
03:13:35,120 --> 03:13:35,960
Thanks silly maid.

4452
03:13:36,100 --> 03:13:36,600
Thank you!

4453
03:13:36,700 --> 03:13:38,380
Thanks guys for hanging out with me.

4454
03:13:38,420 --> 03:13:39,560
I really appreciate it.

4455
03:13:39,960 --> 03:13:40,720
Thank you.

4456
03:13:41,880 --> 03:13:42,740
Thank you.

4457
03:13:44,140 --> 03:13:46,680
I still can't believe there's so many people that will just...

4458
03:13:47,540 --> 03:13:51,040
want to sit in here and watch animal videos with me.

4459
03:13:52,820 --> 03:13:54,320
Makes me really happy.

4460
03:13:56,020 --> 03:13:56,960
So thank you.

4461
03:13:59,660 --> 03:14:00,520
Anyways guys.

4462
03:14:01,700 --> 03:14:02,560
Gonna head out.

4463
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:04,000
And...

4464
03:14:05,800 --> 03:14:06,200
Yeah.

4465
03:14:06,320 --> 03:14:07,480
Thanks for hanging out with me.

4466
03:14:08,480 --> 03:14:08,880
And...

4467
03:14:08,880 --> 03:14:09,720
Have a good night.

4468
03:14:09,860 --> 03:14:10,260
Or day.

4469
03:14:10,400 --> 03:14:10,860
Or whatever.

4470
03:14:10,980 --> 03:14:13,200
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4471
03:14:13,440 --> 03:14:13,840
Probably.

4472
03:14:13,900 --> 03:14:14,380
I will...

4473
03:14:15,960 --> 03:14:17,560
Hopefully get a schedule out.

4474
03:14:18,260 --> 03:14:19,060
Probably not tonight.

4475
03:14:19,180 --> 03:14:20,200
I think my brain is too dead.

4476
03:14:20,360 --> 03:14:24,140
Tomorrow I will hopefully get a schedule out for the week.

4477
03:14:24,280 --> 03:14:25,680
But tomorrow is kinda busy for me.

4478
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:28,880
I'm gonna do my best.

4479
03:14:28,940 --> 03:14:29,500
I'll do my best.

4480
03:14:30,500 --> 03:14:32,060
I'm sorry for being so unprepared.

4481
03:14:33,380 --> 03:14:34,360
I'm sorry for being so unprepared.

4482
03:14:34,680 --> 03:14:35,840
Nan, thank you!

4483
03:14:36,140 --> 03:14:37,540
So there was...

4484
03:14:39,140 --> 03:14:39,640
Bala!

4485
03:14:40,260 --> 03:14:41,740
Thank you for the donut.

4486
03:14:42,080 --> 03:14:42,940
Mint plushies.

4487
03:14:48,760 --> 03:14:49,780
Hoho, thank you!

4488
03:14:53,440 --> 03:14:55,840
Will large mint plushies be made in the future?

4489
03:14:55,920 --> 03:14:57,340
Want to travel with Minto one day.

4490
03:14:58,900 --> 03:15:01,880
But if it's too big, wouldn't it be difficult to travel with?

4491
03:15:01,980 --> 03:15:02,360
Maybe?

4492
03:15:03,780 --> 03:15:04,140
Hmm...

4493
03:15:05,080 --> 03:15:06,200
David, thank you!

4494
03:15:07,400 --> 03:15:08,300
I miss Minto.

4495
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:09,840
I wish chilling with Minto was real.

4496
03:15:10,780 --> 03:15:11,660
Nola, thank you!

4497
03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:16,020
I'm so happy I got the chance to be there and see you at Ayami's panel.

4498
03:15:16,180 --> 03:15:17,180
Thank you for being there.

4499
03:15:17,320 --> 03:15:18,340
It was such a special experience.

4500
03:15:18,520 --> 03:15:20,700
I'll never forget the day for the rest of my life.

4501
03:15:22,920 --> 03:15:24,180
I had a great time at the con.

4502
03:15:24,260 --> 03:15:24,860
I hope you did too.

4503
03:15:24,960 --> 03:15:25,360
I did!

4504
03:15:25,500 --> 03:15:26,120
Thank you!

4505
03:15:28,180 --> 03:15:28,540
Meep!

4506
03:15:28,540 --> 03:15:29,220
Thanks for the donut!

4507
03:15:29,520 --> 03:15:29,880
Gifted!

4508
03:15:30,740 --> 03:15:31,580
Thank you!

4509
03:15:33,760 --> 03:15:34,780
Thank you, thank you!

4510
03:15:35,540 --> 03:15:36,340
Thank you for the stream.

4511
03:15:36,460 --> 03:15:37,520
Can't wait to see you at Ofukai!

4512
03:15:37,640 --> 03:15:40,060
Shoutout to Oymo for getting meet and greet tickets to see you.

4513
03:15:41,480 --> 03:15:42,040
Wait, what?

4514
03:15:43,500 --> 03:15:46,560
I thought Oymo said that she couldn't get the meet and greet tickets.

4515
03:15:48,420 --> 03:15:51,400
Are you being a mean person, Grump?

4516
03:15:53,540 --> 03:15:54,620
You're an amazing company.

4517
03:15:54,720 --> 03:15:55,240
Love you lots.

4518
03:15:55,380 --> 03:15:56,360
Thank you!

4519
03:15:56,360 --> 03:15:59,520
Nothing better than a chill stream with you after a tough Monday at work.

4520
03:15:59,900 --> 03:16:00,380
Yeah.

4521
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:03,860
Yeah, yeah.

4522
03:16:05,540 --> 03:16:07,320
Can't wait to meet you at Ofukai's sleep house.

4523
03:16:07,460 --> 03:16:09,120
Also hope you had fun at ASEN.

4524
03:16:09,460 --> 03:16:10,020
Thank you!

4525
03:16:13,640 --> 03:16:14,740
They wanna fight.

4526
03:16:15,760 --> 03:16:16,240
Fight!

4527
03:16:16,320 --> 03:16:16,720
Fight!

4528
03:16:16,860 --> 03:16:17,260
Fight!

4529
03:16:17,340 --> 03:16:17,780
Fight!

4530
03:16:17,820 --> 03:16:18,300
Fight!

4531
03:16:18,300 --> 03:16:18,700
Fight!

4532
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:19,080
Fight!

4533
03:16:19,320 --> 03:16:20,160
Oh my gosh!

4534
03:16:20,360 --> 03:16:22,020
Fight in my meet and greet!

4535
03:16:22,340 --> 03:16:23,940
Fight in my meet and greet.

4536
03:16:24,860 --> 03:16:27,740
I don't know how this actually works, to be honest.

4537
03:16:28,360 --> 03:16:31,620
I don't know if everybody needs a meet and greet ticket.

4538
03:16:32,380 --> 03:16:34,500
But it did say that groups were allowed.

4539
03:16:35,740 --> 03:16:36,180
So...

4540
03:16:36,780 --> 03:16:37,600
I'm not sure.

4541
03:16:37,720 --> 03:16:38,860
You might wanna ask...

4542
03:16:40,260 --> 03:16:40,980
Ofukai's staff.

4543
03:16:42,340 --> 03:16:44,660
I don't know if one person needs a meet and greet ticket.

4544
03:16:46,280 --> 03:16:46,720
And...

4545
03:16:48,060 --> 03:16:49,380
They need the tickets, yeah?

4546
03:16:50,280 --> 03:16:54,600
Because I was like, if one person has a meet and greet ticket and everybody just goes in together, then...

4547
03:16:57,820 --> 03:16:58,440
You know?

4548
03:16:58,620 --> 03:17:00,360
You know?

4549
03:17:01,640 --> 03:17:02,040
But...

4550
03:17:03,620 --> 03:17:04,420
I just...

4551
03:17:04,420 --> 03:17:07,120
I assume it means multiple ticket people can go in at once.

4552
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:11,480
Okay.

4553
03:17:13,680 --> 03:17:14,600
Well, that's all.

4554
03:17:14,720 --> 03:17:16,320
Instead of a meet and greet, let's have a...

4555
03:17:16,820 --> 03:17:17,300
Um...

4556
03:17:17,300 --> 03:17:18,420
A meet and fight.

4557
03:17:19,700 --> 03:17:20,460
Oh my god!

4558
03:17:20,520 --> 03:17:21,080
M&F!

4559
03:17:23,460 --> 03:17:26,080
It's just like that game series I played as a child.

4560
03:17:27,280 --> 03:17:28,300
Meet and fight.

4561
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:29,280
Okay.

4562
03:17:31,740 --> 03:17:33,120
Let's have a meet and fight.

4563
03:17:33,320 --> 03:17:33,900
Meet and beat?

4564
03:17:34,220 --> 03:17:35,000
Oh, wait.

4565
03:17:37,220 --> 03:17:37,740
Hmm...

4566
03:17:38,260 --> 03:17:40,320
We're workshopping the name a little bit.

4567
03:17:44,090 --> 03:17:46,370
Let's workshop the name a little bit there.

4568
03:17:49,830 --> 03:17:54,850
Please do not come to Mintos expecting a meet and beat.

4569
03:17:54,950 --> 03:17:55,310
Please.

4570
03:18:02,160 --> 03:18:02,520
Oh!

4571
03:18:02,720 --> 03:18:03,320
Oh, wait.

4572
03:18:03,940 --> 03:18:05,180
I can do this right now.

4573
03:18:05,360 --> 03:18:05,840
I can do.

4574
03:18:06,100 --> 03:18:06,820
I can do.

4575
03:18:06,900 --> 03:18:07,340
I can do.

4576
03:18:08,020 --> 03:18:08,780
I can do.

4577
03:18:08,820 --> 03:18:09,240
I can do.

4578
03:18:09,260 --> 03:18:09,700
I can do.

4579
03:18:09,780 --> 03:18:09,780
I can do.

4580
03:18:19,810 --> 03:18:20,690
What is that?

4581
03:18:20,710 --> 03:18:21,390
What am I looking for?

4582
03:18:21,630 --> 03:18:21,990
Oh.

4583
03:18:24,290 --> 03:18:24,650
Here.

4584
03:18:26,070 --> 03:18:27,890
You guys know what time it is.

4585
03:18:28,590 --> 03:18:30,770
It's the end of the stream time.

4586
03:18:36,520 --> 03:18:36,880
Oh.

4587
03:18:36,960 --> 03:18:37,260
Oh.

4588
03:18:37,380 --> 03:18:37,640
Oh.

4589
03:18:37,800 --> 03:18:38,600
The sound is off.

4590
03:18:43,440 --> 03:18:43,920
Yeah.

4591
03:18:45,160 --> 03:18:45,640
Baby.

4592
03:18:46,660 --> 03:18:47,140
Yeah.

4593
03:18:47,380 --> 03:18:47,860
Baby.

4594
03:18:49,660 --> 03:18:50,140
Bed.

4595
03:18:53,540 --> 03:18:54,280
Bed up.

4596
03:18:57,890 --> 03:18:58,850
Something strange.

4597
03:18:59,490 --> 03:19:00,750
Sleeping in your bed.

4598
03:19:01,350 --> 03:19:02,210
Oh my gosh.

4599
03:19:02,250 --> 03:19:03,090
I want to go to sleep.

4600
03:19:03,730 --> 03:19:04,810
Let me tell you something.

4601
03:19:05,670 --> 03:19:07,090
If there's something weird.

4602
03:19:07,830 --> 03:19:09,150
Sleeping in your bed.

4603
03:19:09,650 --> 03:19:10,090
Ow!

4604
03:19:10,330 --> 03:19:11,330
Let me tell you something.

4605
03:19:31,590 --> 03:19:32,430
I

4606
03:19:38,980 --> 03:19:39,960
don't know what it is.

4607
03:19:39,960 --> 03:19:41,460
You look pretty and I don't know that.

4608
03:19:41,460 --> 03:19:42,080
Coming tonight.

4609
03:19:42,080 --> 03:19:45,220
bad magic.

4610
03:19:45,540 --> 03:19:50,980
It's just the 73 Invisible man, sleeping in your bed.

4611
03:19:51,860 --> 03:19:53,340
Let me tell you something.

4612
03:19:54,820 --> 03:19:56,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4613
03:19:57,840 --> 03:20:02,300
Bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin'.

4614
03:20:03,280 --> 03:20:10,780
Bustin', bustin', makes me feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good.

4615
03:20:10,780 --> 03:20:12,960
Yeah, yeah.

4616
03:20:13,220 --> 03:20:17,940
Bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin'.

4617
03:20:17,940 --> 03:20:26,520
Bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', bustin', makes me feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good, feel good.

4618
03:20:31,970 --> 03:20:34,010
Freaky ghost maid!

4619
03:20:36,070 --> 03:20:38,130
Freaky ghost man!

4620
03:20:40,250 --> 03:20:42,350
Freaky man baby!

4621
03:20:45,370 --> 03:20:49,770
If you're all alone, let me sleep in your bed.

4622
03:20:54,550 --> 03:20:56,170
Let me tell you something.

4623
03:20:57,030 --> 03:20:58,950
Sleeping makes me feel good!

4624
03:21:03,270 --> 03:21:04,930
I'm afraid of no sleep.

4625
03:21:05,390 --> 03:21:06,910
I'm afraid of no bed.

4626
03:21:07,710 --> 03:21:10,550
Except the ones in the hotel because they might have bed bugs.

4627
03:21:10,550 --> 03:21:12,690
An invisible bed!

4628
03:21:13,990 --> 03:21:15,790
Freaky ghost bed!

4629
03:21:16,330 --> 03:21:16,370
Yeah!

4630
03:21:16,550 --> 03:21:17,010
Yeah!

4631
03:21:17,050 --> 03:21:17,530
Yeah!

4632
03:21:17,530 --> 03:21:18,290
Yeah!

4633
03:21:18,490 --> 03:21:19,290
Yeah!

4634
03:21:19,930 --> 03:21:20,730
Yeah!

4635
03:21:35,740 --> 03:21:36,540
Yeah!

4636
03:21:36,940 --> 03:21:36,940
Yeah!

4637
03:21:37,080 --> 03:21:37,120
Yeah!

4638
03:21:37,280 --> 03:21:37,280
Yeah!

4639
03:21:37,460 --> 03:21:37,680
Yeah!

4640
03:21:37,680 --> 03:21:38,440
First

4641
03:21:59,110 --> 03:21:59,570
step!

4642
03:21:59,710 --> 03:22:00,070
First step!

4643
03:22:02,150 --> 03:22:02,830
I'm stuck.

4644
03:22:04,130 --> 03:22:04,810
Feel good!

4645
03:22:05,290 --> 03:22:06,030
Feel good!

4646
03:22:06,310 --> 03:22:07,090
Feel good!

4647
03:22:07,350 --> 03:22:08,110
Feel good!

4648
03:22:08,950 --> 03:22:09,750
Yeah!

4649
03:22:09,930 --> 03:22:10,410
Yeah!

4650
03:22:10,430 --> 03:22:10,770
Yeah!

4651
03:22:10,990 --> 03:22:11,710
Guys!

4652
03:22:16,690 --> 03:22:18,090
We're watching today!

4653
03:22:18,830 --> 03:22:19,610
Hanging out with me.

4654
03:22:19,950 --> 03:22:20,870
Welcoming me back.

4655
03:22:21,050 --> 03:22:22,590
I was only gone for a couple of days.

4656
03:22:22,790 --> 03:22:24,250
But I really appreciate it.

4657
03:22:24,390 --> 03:22:26,790
Thanks for letting me watch animal videos!

4658
03:22:27,370 --> 03:22:27,810
Otobito!

4659
03:22:30,590 --> 03:22:32,840
Bye bye!

4660
03:22:33,760 --> 03:22:34,380
Bye bye!
