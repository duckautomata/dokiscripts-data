1
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,860
Ah, sorry for taking so long.

2
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,900
Sorry.

3
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,100
I think that's like the longest waiting screen I've ever had.

4
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,360
I'm so sorry.

5
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,480
Hello everybody.

6
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,780
Hello, hello, hello.

7
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,360
I forgot my controller.

8
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,000
There we go.

9
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,720
That... OK.

10
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,880
It was connecting, but it made the disconnect noise.

11
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,160
That's so funny.

12
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,360
That's so quirky.

13
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,960
12 months of winter!

14
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,800
Thank you!

15
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,440
One year as a Wisp.

16
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:47,860
Wow.

17
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,960
I have a question.

18
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,440
Do you guys think I should like get an official...

19
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,500
Because I'm getting... I'm getting badges for some of the other months.

20
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm getting them made.

21
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,200
But do you want me to get one for one year too?

22
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,060
Or an official like badge?

23
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,580
Or should I... I feel like you can't even read the one that I drew.

24
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:17,720
Yes?

25
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,560
Like, so change that.

26
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,680
Will it still be number one Jorker?

27
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,020
Is that what it says?

28
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,720
Because I wrote Jorker and then I wrote something else, no?

29
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,640
It's funnier this way.

30
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,640
Yeah, all the rest will be nice and shiny and look good and then this one will be ugly.

31
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,180
Hold on, I have it.

32
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,280
Hold on, I have it saved.

33
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,720
I think I was looking at it just the other day.

34
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,740
Sorry, when I click out of the game the audio stops.

35
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,100
What the... I was like, what's tickling my face?

36
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,700
There's a hair on my mic.

37
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,680
Wait, wait, one second.

38
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,100
Where did I... Oh I found it.

39
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,740
Oh it says...

40
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,920
Number one the Jorker.

41
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,580
Oh you're right.

42
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,140
Number one the Jorker.

43
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,240
Yeah, who's hair?

44
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,120
Probably from my cat ears.

45
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:40,780
I wore these yesterday on Doki stream and then I just slept in them.

46
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,960
I didn't even take them off.

47
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,720
So...

48
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,560
Yeah, I have them on again.

49
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,960
I was like, well it doesn't really match Devil May Cry, but it's kind of fun.

50
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,380
It's a little extra bonus for watching the stream.

51
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,400
Kitty may cry.

52
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,500
Queen never cry.

53
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,840
It's not popular anymore.

54
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,300
Gosh, memes come and go so quickly nowadays, huh Koharu?

55
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,900
I have my Koharu plushie... puppet.

56
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,300
I almost said plushie.

57
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,100
My Koharu plush... no, I almost said it again.

58
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,440
Puppet right here.

59
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,040
I've been taking her everywhere like she's my child.

60
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,520
I love her.

61
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:39,960
I got my friend... she did an order like it's for the... it's not Yostar I don't think.

62
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:55,340
I don't think that does like the Chinese store, but like in China they get different Blue Archive merch and they had like a whole bunch of Koharu things and so she helped do an order for me to get Koharu.

63
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,520
The puppet is so cute.

64
00:10:59,660 --> 00:10:59,980
Yes!

65
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:07,620
If you didn't see it, it's on my Twitter, but yeah, I think since Nexon... that would make sense, right?

66
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,540
Did you see the news about Blue Archive coming to Steam?

67
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,720
I did see that.

68
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,600
I did!

69
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,640
First I whip it out, then I thrust it.

70
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,280
Wait, full voiced?

71
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,300
I did not see that.

72
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,040
You think my mobile... you think I'll be able to log in, right?

73
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,000
Who's your favorite DMC character besides Dante?

74
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,900
Mine is Lady.

75
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,300
I think Nero, I like him a lot.

76
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,560
I like Nero.

77
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,840
Full voice?

78
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,640
That's crazy.

79
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,180
One full year of maker.

80
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,380
It's super cute until the puppet starts talking back.

81
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,600
God, I wish!

82
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,400
God, I wish!

83
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,380
Koharu, say something!

84
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,160
Speak to me!

85
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,380
Say something right now!

86
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,180
Do the performance test.

87
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,780
Let's see how many frames you got.

88
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,660
What is this?

89
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,260
I don't even know what the performance test is.

90
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,420
BT!

91
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,320
Florida man.

92
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,940
Thank you for 12 months.

93
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,040
Thank you.

94
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,840
Death penalty.

95
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,160
Death penalty.

96
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,900
I'm thinking more about Virgil.

97
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,600
That suits your name, Virgil.

98
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,420
It's a video, basically.

99
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,120
Oh, really?

100
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,290
Rolling for idols next week?

101
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,970
We're saving for another banner.

102
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,570
I feel like I should save for swimsuit Annika.

103
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,190
Because I really want her.

104
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,470
Why are my frames dropping?

105
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,170
They're dropping like flies!

106
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,570
I wonder...

107
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,590
The time has come and so have I!

108
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,260
I really hope you've been enjoying these games.

109
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm playing them myself right now.

110
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,540
So I don't really want to be spoiled.

111
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,580
Have fun!

112
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,420
Oh, they're still dropping!

113
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,300
It looks so smooth though, no?

114
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,440
Huh?

115
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,130
I guess if you wanted to just listen to the song...

116
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,910
Noisy creatures around here!

117
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:56,930
You!

118
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:57,930
Stupid dog!

119
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,730
The flag is so fast!

120
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,510
It really is!

121
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,070
Look at it zooming!

122
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,030
This is so funny.

123
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,230
They're just causing chaos in the streets.

124
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,680
How long does this go for?

125
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,550
Until the song is over?

126
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,670
I

127
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:40,230
wonder if I wasn't running OBS and Vtube Studio...

128
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,950
What it would be like, you know?

129
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,230
I wonder how much it would be then.

130
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,310
Get me out of here!

131
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,270
Escape!

132
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:01,150
Devil may cry...

133
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,270
I'm gonna turn it down just a little bit though.

134
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,690
Well, I only got up to 300 at my top.

135
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,990
Powerful Minto machine.

136
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,810
It's gotta be powerful though, no?

137
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,170
I gotta have a good computer.

138
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,650
It's the job!

139
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,970
I think 400 plus FPS is sufficient.

140
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,330
That's what happens when you play a game and it's just like...

141
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,150
What FPS limit do you want?

142
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,030
And it says unlimited.

143
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,670
Let your computer be free!

144
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,470
Wait, did I miss?

145
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,750
Wait, did you say that Hayden?

146
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,590
Oh my gosh, wait.

147
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,490
Happy birthday to me!

148
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,690
I feel like such a jerk.

149
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,390
I didn't even read.

150
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,610
Or I saw it.

151
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,630
I'm so sorry.

152
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,490
I'm such a jerk.

153
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,950
My time is... Wait, I think it just... Sorry.

154
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,410
I was up so late last night.

155
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,410
So I'm a little slow today.

156
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,370
I'm a little slow today.

157
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,390
Yes!

158
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,910
Hayden, happy birthday!

159
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,730
Happy birthday to you.

160
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,450
Happy birthday to you.

161
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,010
Happy birthday dear Hayden.

162
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,150
Happy birthday to you.

163
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,490
Happy birthday!

164
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:36,970
I try not to run on autopilot during stream because...

165
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,070
I could always just see a super chat and be like, thanks for the super chat!

166
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,110
And not read it and not process what it says or anything and just be like, thanks!

167
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,390
But I don't want to be... I want to read your message.

168
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,950
But I felt like I was just on autopilot just then.

169
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,650
That's so freaky.

170
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,990
I've never been like that before.

171
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,110
You know when you get on autopilot when you're driving your car and you're just going through the motions?

172
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,450
Freaky, freaky, freaky.

173
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,110
I don't like it.

174
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,710
I don't like that that just happened to me.

175
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,370
I feel freaky, but in a bad way.

176
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,670
Freaky derogatory.

177
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,130
I went on autopilot today at work.

178
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,550
Yeah, but that's understandable, no?

179
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,770
Severin's real!

180
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,850
Who was I talking to?

181
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,810
This might be a little too like...

182
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,310
I won't mention the other person just in case they don't want to...

183
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,290
This might be a little too like...

184
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,710
How do you say?

185
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,670
Actually, I mentioned it in the business...

186
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,230
Business Insider.

187
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,350
It might be a little too like fourth WALL-E, so sorry.

188
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,670
I've never seen that movie, WALL-E.

189
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:55,950
Was it Mogu?

190
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,690
How do you know what I'm talking about, Radix?

191
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,030
Who else other than Mogu?

192
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,470
Well yeah, Mogu was...

193
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,490
Actually, I haven't talked to so many people about Severin's.

194
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,610
But how like...

195
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,030
Kind of...

196
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,710
Like I'm an innie, you guys.

197
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,870
It's kind of freaky.

198
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,210
Wait, if I possessed you, would I be your innie?

199
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,130
Wait...

200
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,910
I wonder if that's how it would work.

201
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,890
lol Oh!

202
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,710
I pressed the wrong button.

203
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,330
You know, it's fine.

204
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,930
McPain must do that to me a lot.

205
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,370
Brandon, I hope you heal up soon, man.

206
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,330
I feel so bad.

207
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,590
Linking and trying to remember the last two miles.

208
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:44,930
Yes!

209
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,190
Yes, yes, yes!

210
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,250
Actually though...

211
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,910
Also, Nicholas, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

212
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,850
Thank you!

213
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,470
Clockwork, welcome back.

214
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,830
And BinaryGhost, welcome back!

215
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,810
Your DMC playthrough reminded me of just...

216
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,970
How much I love this franchise.

217
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,330
I ended up buying DMC 1 through 5 on my PC.

218
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,430
I can't wait for you to play DMC 5!

219
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,690
Thanks, Waterboy!

220
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,930
I've heard that DMC 5 might be my favorite one.

221
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,670
I think that's like the fan favorite, no?

222
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,950
Which is kind of crazy.

223
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,990
That like...

224
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,810
The last game of the series is the most...

225
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:18,730
Like...

226
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,370
I don't know.

227
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,750
This peak, it's amazing.

228
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,650
Is it...

229
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,330
I guess it's like...

230
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,690
That's so rare where they like...

231
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,370
Where a game series will not only...

232
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,330
Implement quality of life changes...

233
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,350
But then also have a good story.

234
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,410
So...

235
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,610
Especially that late in the series.

236
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,590
Like 5 games later.

237
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,790
That's so...

238
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,930
That's so impressive.

239
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,170
That's so impressive.

240
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,250
DMC 6 Cope.

241
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,650
Who knows?

242
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,730
Maybe...

243
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,490
That will be my new Tomodachi life too.

244
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,330
Thank you so much, you're so sweet.

245
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,950
No, I feel like that's what anybody would say, no?

246
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,630
Are you gonna play DMC?

247
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,190
I don't know yet.

248
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,930
We'll see how much I'm thirsting for more Devil May Cry content.

249
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,730
I might get the end of 5 and be like...

250
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,970
I have to play it, you know?

251
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,590
I mean, I played...

252
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,610
I played 2.

253
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,110
Might as well, huh?

254
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,610
It's a very long though.

255
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,790
It's a very long.

256
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,930
Have you watched the DMC Netflix show?

257
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,010
No, I haven't.

258
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,990
I know it's set in a different...

259
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,730
Like, timeline, universe...

260
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,770
Type of dealio, but...

261
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,950
I'm waiting to finish the games before I watch the animes.

262
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,310
Both of them.

263
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,030
DMC is a much better game than 2 for what it's worth.

264
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,630
Ah, okay.

265
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,030
Well, that's good to know at least.

266
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,110
That's good to know at least.

267
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,030
Please use the Sparda skin.

268
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,370
Oh!

269
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,710
Mr. Orange, I was going to.

270
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,130
Because I wanted to match the thumbnail.

271
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,030
But I won't be disappointed.

272
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,390
Okay.

273
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,490
I'm excited then.

274
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,610
I'm excited.

275
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,390
Both DMC anime are okay.

276
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,050
And worth watching once.

277
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,110
I feel like...

278
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,870
I don't know, I know that some people have mixed opinions on the new one.

279
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,190
But probably because...

280
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,870
Some people want to see the games being animated.

281
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,350
But then if they go off on their own timeline...

282
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,990
It's kind of, you know...

283
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,430
DMC isn't as bad as 2.

284
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,730
They made a lot of updates that fix a lot of the gameplay problems at launch.

285
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,650
I see.

286
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,910
DMC Devil May Cry is good.

287
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,790
Different, but good.

288
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:40,410
Okay.

289
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,230
See, I've always heard that it was bad.

290
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,390
Now I don't know what to believe.

291
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,610
So many people are saying it's good.

292
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,010
Is that a lie too?

293
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,530
Hello Mito.

294
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,630
Congrats on 350k.

295
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,530
Can I pet that kitty Mito?

296
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,750
No pet.

297
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,700
I'm matching with Koharu right now.

298
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,320
Anyway.

299
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,680
Should we start?

300
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,660
We have like 4 missions I believe it was.

301
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,820
17, 18, 19, 20.

302
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,660
I think.

303
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,460
And...

304
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,160
I'll do my best...

305
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,820
To get through them in a reasonable amount of time.

306
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,980
Don't play on PC.

307
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,720
Sad, I remember...

308
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,220
Yeah, the ports for 1 through 3 were not so great for PC either.

309
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,420
Amazing.

310
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,140
Thank you.

311
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,720
Pet, pet, pet, pet, pet.

312
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,930
5 is fine on the PC.

313
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,950
I did hear that too.

314
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,530
Actually, I think I...

315
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,110
Hold on, let me see.

316
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,010
Devil may cry.

317
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,050
I do own the...

318
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,870
I actually bought the HD collection for PC.

319
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,990
Before I realized.

320
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,290
I think it was like a big...

321
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,210
There was a big sale.

322
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,950
And so I bought all of them at once.

323
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,690
And then I heard that the port for PC...

324
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,810
For the HD collection...

325
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,650
Was not good.

326
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,670
So...

327
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,110
But that's okay.

328
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,350
My job is ending so I'm ordering some wacky pizza.

329
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,610
It's Friday.

330
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,790
It is Friday.

331
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,950
Yeah, it's Friday.

332
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,030
Friday is pizza day.

333
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,210
And what better game to play...

334
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,930
Wait, what better game to eat pizza with than devil may cry?

335
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,530
Too late to return it?

336
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,070
Actually...

337
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,810
I might...

338
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,710
Steam doesn't have like a...

339
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,990
I know they have like an app...

340
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,790
Like if you play for more than two hours...

341
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,970
You can't return it, but...

342
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,570
Do they have a date of return?

343
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,610
Because I bought it so long ago.

344
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:14,950
Two weeks.

345
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:15,690
Ah, yeah.

346
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,330
No way.

347
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,870
Ah, yeah.

348
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,370
No way.

349
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:20,630
No way.

350
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,710
It's okay though.

351
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,170
Devil may cry.

352
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,950
I'm waiting for my tears.

353
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,110
I'm waiting for my tears.

354
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,430
Unfortunate, but understandable.

355
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,390
Yeah, it's okay.

356
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,530
It's all good.

357
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,360
Golly.

358
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,580
This outfit is so silly.

359
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,860
Are we really gonna finish up the game in this outfit?

360
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,640
Pirate, do you...

361
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,140
Do you...

362
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,720
Do you change the number of fives every time?

363
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,720
I feel like it's grown.

364
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,500
I mean, I've made it longer, but...

365
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,980
I feel like it's gotten longer.

366
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,840
Packed and tried to leave on autopilot.

367
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,200
That was pretty embarrassing.

368
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,540
You're going downtown.

369
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,420
Wow.

370
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,480
You're a criminal.

371
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,160
Yeah, we're matching the thumbnail.

372
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,420
We're matching the thumbnail.

373
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,880
Chatter is admitting to a felony.

374
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,420
It wouldn't be a felon...

375
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,640
Wait.

376
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,960
A felony is like a big, big crime, no?

377
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:09,300
A felony would be like if you stole thousands of dollars worth of groceries, no?

378
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,160
Or is a felony also a small crime?

379
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,140
I paid for it.

380
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,020
Yeah, with jail time.

381
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,260
Felony is big crimes, yeah.

382
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,740
Yeah, so...

383
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,700
Stole one dozen eggs.

384
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,660
Yeah, I paid for it.

385
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,880
Five years in the slammer.

386
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:44,500
In California, a felony is a serious criminal offense punishable by death or imprisonment in state prison for more than one year.

387
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,800
Wow.

388
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,700
Wow.

389
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,340
What's a...

390
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,460
What's like a small crime, then?

391
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,090
Small crime versus big crime.

392
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,350
Big crime...

393
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,030
Murder.

394
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,770
Misdemeanor.

395
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,490
So if I punch someone, is that a misdemeanor?

396
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,750
Jaywalking?

397
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,390
I see.

398
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,280
Where does tax evasion fall?

399
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,120
I'm just kidding.

400
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,120
I'm just kidding!

401
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,140
Commit?

402
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,200
No!

403
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,120
No!

404
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,860
It's definitely a felony.

405
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,720
My FBI agent...

406
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,420
Hold on, let me tell my phone this.

407
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,300
I did not commit tax evasion.

408
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,520
I did not commit tax evasion.

409
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,000
I did not commit tax evasion.

410
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,800
Commit?

411
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,000
Sometimes if I say something...

412
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,440
Like, kind of out there...

413
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,980
I'll...

414
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,880
Like, maybe I'm just...

415
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,820
I'm just, you know...

416
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm just joking!

417
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,200
I have to remind my FBI agent in my phone.

418
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,340
I'll be like...

419
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,920
Or if I really want something to happen, I'll be like...

420
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll be like...

421
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,420
What's an example?

422
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,160
For example...

423
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,880
I don't know.

424
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,370
I felt like cooking up a DMC Dante mix.

425
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:37,910
Wait!

426
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,190
Wait!

427
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,830
Jinzo fire sparta my dad.

428
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,290
Yeah!

429
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:42,870
Yeah!

430
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,510
Double, double trigger.

431
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,770
Purple, blue orb.

432
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,990
Purple, blue orb.

433
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,210
Wacky woohoo.

434
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,610
Pizza man!

435
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,070
Did I get the cadence right?

436
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,400
Why purple and blue orb though?

437
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,940
Blorb, blorb, blorb.

438
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,940
Okay, I'm stalling.

439
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,160
Sorry.

440
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,620
Oh my gosh!

441
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,300
This is where we did the test!

442
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,460
We're doing another performance test everybody.

443
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,860
Regain possession of Yamato.

444
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,220
Yamato.

445
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,740
Rorb erasure.

446
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,600
Yeah, we have to include all rorbs maybe.

447
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,940
I mean all orbs.

448
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,520
Made it home just in time.

449
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,480
Examito.

450
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,180
Yay!

451
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,540
Thank you!

452
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,420
Tomato.

453
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:38,980
Tomato.

454
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,860
Yamato.

455
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,100
Tomato, Yamato.

456
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,700
That awkward moment when you work for the IRS and your OSHI starts talking about tax evasion.

457
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,840
I...

458
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,900
It wasn't... I didn't commit any crime.

459
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,040
Am I...

460
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,520
I literally, literally texted my tax person like right before stream.

461
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,420
My tax person is a real, real person.

462
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:22,080
And not someone that said that they would get me out of doing my taxes.

463
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,380
Oh no, she sounds guilty.

464
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,660
I've never been guilty ever.

465
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,160
He's Ocelot.

466
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,140
Yeah, Ocelot's doing my taxes for me.

467
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,970
Oh gosh, I'm gonna have to get all reacquainted.

468
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,110
Ah...

469
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,550
It's okay, I haven't done mine in like a decade, boss.

470
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,310
In Minecraft.

471
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,570
Is your tax person in the room with us right now?

472
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,750
I hope not.

473
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,070
I hope she's not watching.

474
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,710
Okay, hold on.

475
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,410
We got our stingers.

476
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,430
We've got our stinger tool.

477
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:18,970
Okay.

478
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,370
Lucifer.

479
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,090
This is the one I just got.

480
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,710
This is the one that I haven't used yet.

481
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,270
Lucifer.

482
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,050
Yes, yes, yes.

483
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:31,790
I want to test him.

484
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,710
I want to test him.

485
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,050
My guns.

486
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,770
Wait, I think I just have the charge.

487
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,190
I don't have that.

488
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,890
I did not buy that.

489
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,050
Pandora, this thing is hard.

490
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,070
Wow, holding X and then we circle around.

491
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,710
Styles.

492
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,070
We have...

493
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,870
Just jumping around.

494
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,210
Sword Master.

495
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,610
Gunslinger.

496
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,130
What is this?

497
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,250
Where did I buy this?

498
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:20,550
Minto probably has enough dependents to claim from the karaoke stream tonight.

499
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:21,990
What do you mean dependents?

500
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,350
Oh, babies.

501
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,070
Oh, I don't use royal guard.

502
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,490
I'm sorry.

503
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,570
I know people are going to flame me.

504
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,150
Trigger heart.

505
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,770
Sorry, I'm just going through everything again.

506
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,970
I'm so slow today.

507
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,050
I'm so sorry, you guys.

508
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,190
I feel like I've been saying that a lot lately, but...

509
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,430
Today I just didn't get much sleep.

510
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:43,870
I'm sorry.

511
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,410
It's okay, no royal guard.

512
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,390
Thank you.

513
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,850
Autopilot Minto.

514
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,050
Again, I've never been like that before.

515
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,810
That was so freaky.

516
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,570
Freaky, freaky.

517
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,830
Freaky derogatory.

518
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,850
I need to get one more lore fragment.

519
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,820
Let's just go into it.

520
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,080
See what happens.

521
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,060
It's been a long week, huh boys?

522
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,420
Sorry the outfit is so funny.

523
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,560
Is this it?

524
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,340
This?

525
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,420
Dante dripped out.

526
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,520
Did you guys see that?

527
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,860
That clip of the guy who directed the new Netflix anime.

528
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
And he was at like some wrestling event.

529
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,680
And it was just like...

530
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,220
This is the guy.

531
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,700
Cosplaying Dante from Devil May Cry.

532
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,300
The Netflix series.

533
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,120
No one cheers.

534
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,900
No one boos.

535
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,040
It was like...

536
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,940
It was like the most quiet I've ever seen a WWE audience.

537
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,840
Literally ever.

538
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,680
Boys are awkward, huh?

539
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,220
Alright, hold on.

540
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,920
Oh my goodness.

541
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,140
Big.

542
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,780
What is this?

543
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,800
Oh.

544
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,700
Ah!

545
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,520
You're telling me Nero needs to break that, huh?

546
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,900
Okay, well that guy is somewhere.

547
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,200
Where the hell do I go in here?

548
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,160
What?

549
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,560
What?

550
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,680
There's like...Oh, I think I...

551
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,860
Wait, do I press this?

552
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,100
No?

553
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,180
What am I on right now?

554
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,240
Swordmaster, okay.

555
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,360
I guess I go this way.

556
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,280
Wait, this is where I get...

557
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,460
Wait.

558
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,640
Down?

559
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,380
Oh, I see it.

560
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,360
I didn't even notice.

561
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Ah!

562
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,200
Money.

563
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,400
Already lost.

564
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,460
Today is gonna be rough, you guys.

565
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,720
Today might be a little rough.

566
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,780
Come out everybody.

567
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,960
I want to test my new toys.

568
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,160
Over here.

569
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,980
Someone will come out.

570
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,400
Hello?

571
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,520
Why is it...Oh.

572
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,800
There we go.

573
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,760
Okay.

574
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,560
Oh, wait.

575
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,280
Wow!

576
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,020
Wait.

577
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:08,830
Wait.

578
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,690
Oh, shoot.

579
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,530
Oh, wow.

580
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,490
Am I killing them?

581
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,610
I can't tell.

582
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,450
Yah!

583
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,010
Yah!

584
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,590
Yah!

585
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,070
Yah!

586
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,510
Very slowly.

587
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,810
That's kind of fun though.

588
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,250
Interesting.

589
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,470
Oh, ouch.

590
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,210
Okay.

591
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:42,750
Interesting.

592
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,680
I think I...I don't think I get it.

593
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,040
But it's interesting.

594
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,620
For sure.

595
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,340
Oh, no.

596
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,320
Oh, no.

597
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,500
How do I make them explode?

598
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,840
Do I have to do that manually?

599
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,900
What the hell was that?

600
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,380
It's timed.

601
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:08,660
Okay.

602
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,000
Oh!

603
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,060
Back and wide?

604
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,940
Oh, ouch.

605
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,420
Hold on.

606
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,060
Oh, I can't aim it very well though.

607
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,020
I still haven't even killed this Jester man.

608
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,460
This is so tricky.

609
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,040
You have to aim it really well.

610
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
What if I do this?

611
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,100
Okay, hold on.

612
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,300
What the hell is that?

613
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,980
I'm confused what's going on.

614
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,480
This is a strange...

615
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,060
Lucifer is weird, you guys.

616
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,180
I don't know if I like it.

617
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,440
Oh, shoot.

618
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,420
I'm acupuncturing them.

619
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,360
He's got some in his head.

620
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,360
Oh, dang it.

621
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,740
I missed.

622
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,500
I don't know if I like it.

623
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,660
Is this like kind of slow?

624
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,760
Oh, my god.

625
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,570
Golly.

626
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,110
Come here.

627
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:41,970
Come here.

628
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,520
Stupid.

629
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,760
Oh,

630
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,860
I thought I would have dodged that.

631
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,240
Oh, my god.

632
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,340
These guys are so...

633
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,780
Lucifer is known to be one of the most complicated weapons in the franchise.

634
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,780
I don't know if I like it very much.

635
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,340
I feel like they give it to you too late game...

636
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,760
to figure out how to use it properly.

637
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,660
Alaric, thank you.

638
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,520
Hey, Pocktie, welcome back.

639
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,260
Thank you.

640
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,580
You're supposed to play TMC games multiple times.

641
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,660
Yeah.

642
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,580
Yeah, I know.

643
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,440
We'll just stick with...

644
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,210
Oh, this is not what I want to do.

645
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,570
We'll just stick with this one for now.

646
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,510
Maybe if I... Hold on.

647
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,450
Let's look at the skill list.

648
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,050
Ability.

649
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,810
Oh, not ability.

650
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:08,810
Style.

651
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,410
Nope, not... Oh, wait.

652
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:10,950
Sword.

653
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,210
Not Lucifer.

654
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:12,830
There we go.

655
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,870
While on the ground, press Y, Y, Y, Y, Y.

656
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,190
Why?

657
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,630
Why?

658
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,730
Position swords around you and pierce your enemies repeatedly.

659
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,950
I feel like this would be a great weapon to use in the beginning.

660
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,310
Like, of the battle.

661
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,190
You pierce them.

662
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,750
So you get that extra, like, little...

663
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,470
You know, oomph in them and then you switch to another weapon.

664
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,370
Or something.

665
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,670
It's for set-ups, yeah.

666
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,030
While on the ground, Y.

667
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,330
Then Y.

668
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,470
And then Y.

669
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,370
While on the ground, press Y, Y.

670
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,530
Then Y.

671
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,150
And the enemy is suffering.

672
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,970
By launching them into a new realm of pain.

673
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,670
Y, Y, Y, Y.

674
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:05,610
Why?

675
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:05,670
Why?

676
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,300
They just sit there.

677
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,120
Ecstasy.

678
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,700
So you gotta, like, really aim it.

679
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:18,920
Wait.

680
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,780
Trigger the detonation of the blade's precision.

681
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,320
So you can...

682
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,140
So that's what you meant by...

683
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,280
Back and then Y.

684
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,880
The throw of the rose.

685
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,380
So first you get pierced and then you go into ecstasy.

686
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:37,460
Ecstasy.

687
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,560
Throw multiple swords and position them in the air in front of you.

688
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:44,940
Okay.

689
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,440
Looks like we can do some cool shit, but it's fussy.

690
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,500
I don't wanna give up on it just yet, but...

691
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,660
We'll see.

692
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,560
We'll see how I'm feeling first off.

693
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,500
You know.

694
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,940
Dante's improv dialogue was way better if he just kept saying Y, Y, Y.

695
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,680
Anything up here?

696
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,080
Oh, that's where I'm supposed to go.

697
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,420
Nothing up there?

698
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:27,760
Oh god.

699
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,720
I don't know.

700
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,440
Just remember Y, Y, Y, Y.

701
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,200
Oh my god, an alligator!

702
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,140
Oh shit, it's the grabby guy.

703
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,460
I

704
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,040
don't like you!

705
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,140
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,260
I'm sorry.

707
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,900
Go away, crocodile!

708
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,740
Did you guys see that outback?

709
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,420
Oh my god.

710
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,020
The new outback drink.

711
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,980
The crop tail.

712
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,600
Oh, that wasn't good.

713
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,620
Oh my god, you shoot too?

714
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,620
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, Dante!

715
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,110
There's a second one!

716
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:03,150
Oh, please, please, please!

717
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,440
There we go.

718
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,660
Oh, it's the shotgun.

719
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:18,720
Thank you.

720
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,840
I knew guns were good.

721
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,340
No, no, no, no, my money!

722
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,240
Wait!

723
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:28,080
I didn't start... I don't think I started attacking her, but...

724
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,720
Okay.

725
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,240
The children laugh.

726
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,940
Follow the little rope road.

727
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,180
Follow the little rope road.

728
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,660
Follow, follow, follow, follow, follow the little rope road.

729
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,440
Leads to nothing.

730
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,540
Nice secret.

731
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,200
Wait, if I just stand there, do you think something will drop?

732
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:17,680
Sad.

733
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:17,760
Sad.

734
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:19,920
Sad!

735
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,120
Yay!

736
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,880
Tomatoes!

737
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,200
My healing substance.

738
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,400
Tomato, tomato.

739
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,060
Give me them grorbs, please.

740
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,330
Oh, that's a flag.

741
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:49,330
It's gonna say what's moving over there.

742
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,510
Can I chop these cars?

743
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:51,530
Dang.

744
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,950
So not this way.

745
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,450
Can I chop these?

746
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,010
Yes, I can.

747
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,330
I see a fragment!

748
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:08,890
I see a fragment!

749
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,130
Oh, big boy, big boy, big boy.

750
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,210
Big boy!

751
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,090
Big boy!

752
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,660
This is literally just the performance test!

753
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,530
There we go.

754
00:46:58,610 --> 00:46:59,870
Here, let's get this guy over here.

755
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,710
You missed, Dante!

756
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:03,790
How could you miss?

757
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:09,940
How could you?

758
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,320
Yeah!

759
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,280
It does kinda sound like he's saying that though, no?

760
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,600
He's flailing everywhere.

761
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,080
Ouchie, ouchie, ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

762
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,260
I'm on fire.

763
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,480
Oh, it's the dogs!

764
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,780
Where did you come from?

765
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,560
Where did the dogs come from?

766
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,730
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

767
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,570
There's another big boy?

768
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:19,670
Oh, no.

769
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:21,530
Shoot, I tried to dodge that.

770
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:24,530
Jump, jump, jump, jump.

771
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,510
Where are the dogs at?

772
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,770
You don't hear it?

773
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:31,490
You really don't?

774
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,310
Is the volume too low?

775
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,230
Oh, shoot.

776
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,790
Yeah, don't even try, stupid dog.

777
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,350
What the dog doing?

778
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,890
Dog being crazy on me.

779
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,030
That's what the dog's doing.

780
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:56,230
OK, I think I broke everything that I could for...

781
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:02,890
Oh, please.

782
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,790
Do I have to be...

783
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:06,970
Dante, use your arms.

784
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,870
He's like, I can't lift my hands up too high in this outfit.

785
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,990
OK, D, T, now.

786
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,830
Oh, just kidding.

787
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:15,290
There we go.

788
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,020
Yay!

789
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,120
Oh my gosh!

790
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,140
New blue orb!

791
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,950
We got a full blorb.

792
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,630
Yeah, easy peasy.

793
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:35,650
Easy peasy.

794
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,120
Would you rather your cat ears or human...

795
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,740
Human... I'm not even a human!

796
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,690
Why does his outfit sound so wet when he's moving around?

797
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,310
Do you hear this?

798
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,410
Listen, I turned it up.

799
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,630
Why is it so wet?

800
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,810
Spongebob sounding ass over here.

801
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,350
It's so squishy.

802
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,850
Also, do not rub any ears.

803
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:31,950
Denied.

804
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,090
Denied.

805
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:35,290
Denied.

806
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,550
Denied on any ears.

807
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:41,270
Denied.

808
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:41,870
Denied.

809
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:42,530
Denied.

810
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,170
Denied.

811
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,290
The ears are not for rubbing.

812
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:55,810
Decorative purpose only.

813
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,730
Did I go over?

814
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,270
Bus is too big.

815
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,570
Oh, I thought that was a bench for a second.

816
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,490
I was like, why is there a bench in the middle of the road?

817
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,430
Wait, why are there so many doors?

818
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,040
All roads lead to Fire Emblem Hills.

819
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,740
So you don't want us to play favorites and you want us to rub both ears.

820
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,220
No!

821
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,580
No!

822
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,180
No!

823
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:42,600
No!

824
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,260
No!

825
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,880
No!

826
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,320
No!

827
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:45,220
Wait,

828
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,040
where are the doors?

829
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,940
Are they upstairs?

830
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,140
I'm trying to break an entry.

831
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,990
Wearing these ears was a mistake.

832
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,650
Wearing these ears was a mistake.

833
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:32,610
Stop distracting

834
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,160
me!

835
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,560
You're scratching.

836
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,000
Stop!

837
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,040
Secret.

838
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,120
What's this one?

839
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,680
This one might be a little hard for...oh wait, I'm going to try it though.

840
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,600
I'm going to try it.

841
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,360
Reach the goal!

842
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,040
Wait, how?

843
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,840
Wait, actually how?

844
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:23,820
What?

845
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,800
There's no stinking way.

846
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,350
Yeah, there's no time stop.

847
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:41,590
Crazy.

848
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,090
OK.

849
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,550
Let's go get ambushed or something.

850
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,570
What is flying above us?

851
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,450
What is this crazy shadow?

852
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,950
What is that?

853
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,830
It reminds me of those Halloween decorations.

854
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,290
You know what I'm talking about?

855
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:04,530
That's just like little witches flying about.

856
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,510
Wisp meet up.

857
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,940
Please!

858
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:21,660
Please!

859
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:22,600
Please!

860
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,440
Please!

861
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:24,680
Please!

862
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,400
Please!

863
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,180
Please!

864
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,260
Oh my god.

865
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,380
No.

866
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,000
There we go, finally.

867
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,280
Please!

868
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:39,780
Please!

869
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,340
Kill that thing!

870
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:40,620
Please!

871
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,440
Don't let it!

872
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:41,860
Don't let it!

873
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,360
Don't let it!

874
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,200
Come on Dante!

875
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,340
I need you to kill it like right now!

876
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,160
Where'd he go?

877
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:48,900
Please!

878
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,340
Please!

879
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,000
Please!

880
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:54,990
Oh, thank god.

881
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,720
These angel guys are so cool, but they are so annoying.

882
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,080
Please!

883
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:10,480
Come here!

884
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:13,840
Nevermind.

885
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:14,860
I changed my mind.

886
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,400
Come down here!

887
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,910
Oh, I messed up.

888
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,060
Yay!

889
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,940
I don't like this area.

890
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,460
It's so hard to see for some reason.

891
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,320
Get out of my way!

892
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,040
There are so many little areas to get trapped in here.

893
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:02,900
Oh nice.

894
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,240
Wait, I just got that.

895
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:04,820
Oh wait, come on.

896
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,780
Take him out.

897
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,180
Take him out.

898
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,760
Before he gets us...

899
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,460
What?

900
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:16,250
Sorry.

901
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,040
Oh, it's the big man!

902
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,020
I hate the most!

903
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,840
Sorry.

904
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,000
Oh my god, he scared the heck out of me.

905
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,220
This is times to DT.

906
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,000
Oh my god, please!

907
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:01,790
Kill!

908
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:02,310
Kill!

909
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,190
Get him!

910
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,070
Stunlock him!

911
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:05,250
Stunlock him DT!

912
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,950
Stay away from me you freak!

913
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,550
I can't see anything.

914
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:21,530
I don't know where you are.

915
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:22,710
Stay away from me!

916
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:23,950
Stay away from me!

917
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:24,630
Where are you?

918
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:26,330
Stay away from me!

919
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,170
Stay away from me!

920
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:27,930
Stay away from me!

921
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,170
No, no, no.

922
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:32,830
Go get him.

923
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,050
Oh I got him.

924
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,200
That cat is barking about angels again.

925
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:59,150
Do I have to purchase that?

926
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:01,890
Oh, not this way.

927
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:02,270
Sorry.

928
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:04,530
Wait.

929
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,630
What's this door?

930
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:13,950
Wait, what's down here?

931
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:14,470
Hold on.

932
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,170
Are there two ways I go?

933
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,570
Can I go inside here?

934
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:19,290
Yes.

935
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:23,870
It's unlocked when you buy Swordmaster level 4.

936
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,490
That door is for Nero.

937
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:32,970
Well...

938
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,850
Well, it's also made for Dante.

939
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:43,470
It didn't say his name on it.

940
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,490
I don't think they'd let me go in if I...

941
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,170
couldn't, right?

942
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,120
Dante and Nero door.

943
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:04,600
Exactly.

944
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,840
I can get some special things in here.

945
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,620
There's another door.

946
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,560
I do remember this room.

947
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:17,840
But...

948
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,520
And look, we even got health.

949
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,610
I'm just...

950
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,790
It's right there.

951
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,370
It's right there.

952
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,110
The gorb.

953
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,400
And this is where we learned how to use the grabby grub.

954
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:55,770
Do I have to come back here as Nero?

955
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:02,390
Hold on.

956
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:03,830
I hate chairs.

957
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,430
Once is no way to...

958
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:09,550
Oh.

959
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,090
Okay.

960
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,610
Well, we just...

961
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:17,610
did a little bit of...

962
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,930
backtracking, I suppose.

963
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:23,530
It's fine.

964
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,350
Wait.

965
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,150
Can I destroy this?

966
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:28,630
Wait.

967
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,150
Oh, no, I can't.

968
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:30,290
Okay.

969
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:36,870
Dante can use demon magic to create almost anything, yet the only thing he makes are unlimited ammo and roses to throw.

970
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,810
He's a simple guy.

971
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:41,910
He doesn't need anymore.

972
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:43,150
Right.

973
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,250
Chat, how did you get here?

974
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,150
I walked.

975
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,630
I took the door.

976
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,750
It's all about style.

977
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:55,290
Yeah.

978
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:58,970
I hope I don't have to fight those guys again.

979
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,750
Probably not, right?

980
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:02,930
Wait.

981
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:04,270
This is...

982
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:05,710
This is the door.

983
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,350
I bet Mint would like Nero's demon arm.

984
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:12,850
What's up?

985
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:13,490
What's up?

986
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:14,130
What's up?

987
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,250
Why are you so obsessed with the rubbing ears?

988
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,260
Uh-oh.

989
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,560
What are we about to fight?

990
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,420
What are we about to fight?

991
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,160
I have two holy waters, so I don't feel like I should buy any more.

992
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,800
Obviously, I can't buy any more blorbs or porbs.

993
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:40,420
I have one...

994
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,340
Peek?

995
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,300
Here comes peek?

996
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:47,840
Really?

997
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:49,860
I'm excited.

998
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,500
I'm excited.

999
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:56,100
Maybe I'll grab an M star.

1000
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,000
And I have an L star.

1001
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,000
And I have two double stars.

1002
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,920
Best scenes?

1003
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,920
Wait, really?

1004
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,100
Let's go!

1005
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:36,760
Is he going to sing?

1006
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:44,880
Full power!

1007
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,920
Why is the music so whimsical?

1008
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,420
Oh!

1009
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:50,960
Full power!

1010
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,200
Oh it's so going!

1011
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:12,660
Oh yeah!

1012
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,180
Oh my god!

1013
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,380
Oh, not some dogs.

1014
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,380
Why dogs?

1015
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,260
Why does it always have to be the dogs?

1016
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,420
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1017
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,520
Let's get away from you.

1018
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,250
Did he make these?

1019
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,890
Is that why there are so many of them?

1020
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,180
This guy is such a weenie.

1021
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,640
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1022
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,380
Oh, I'm so stupid.

1023
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,280
Nice.

1024
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:21,780
Oh, dang it.

1025
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:22,600
I think I...

1026
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:23,900
Demon.

1027
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,720
I shouldn't have when I...

1028
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,400
Wait, what's going on?

1029
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:36,580
No!

1030
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:37,160
Is he healing?

1031
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,460
Oh you mother trucker.

1032
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:51,520
Ouch!

1033
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,200
Oh gosh.

1034
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,760
I thought I could...

1035
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,500
Ah!

1036
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,460
Don't get away from me!

1037
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,600
Ouch,

1038
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:22,680
ouch, ouch.

1039
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,800
How

1040
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:38,650
do I...

1041
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:42,150
How do I avoid this part?

1042
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,390
Yeah, yeah.

1043
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:49,350
Just attack?

1044
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:50,370
Just hit him?

1045
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:50,670
OK.

1046
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:52,910
Wait.

1047
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:53,850
Ah, shoot, shoot.

1048
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:57,410
Oh, nice, nice.

1049
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:59,670
What the hell?

1050
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:08,130
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1051
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:10,250
No, sorry, sorry.

1052
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,590
I'm wondering if I want to heal or not.

1053
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,730
I hate these!

1054
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,800
These are the ones that go underneath, no?

1055
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:23,940
You're still good?

1056
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:24,620
Keep going?

1057
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,440
Should be fine.

1058
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,000
Oh my god.

1059
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,060
Oh, wait, where am I?

1060
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:33,600
Wait.

1061
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,820
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1062
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:51,190
There we go.

1063
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:56,770
Oh, more dogs.

1064
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:06,930
That was close.

1065
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:10,770
He's so close!

1066
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:12,070
He's so close!

1067
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,290
Nice!

1068
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:45,910
What?

1069
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:46,410
What's that?

1070
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:47,630
Oh, he's writing his notes?

1071
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:50,570
Please!

1072
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:56,210
Not for the Sigma!

1073
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:00,090
The research!

1074
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:06,330
Oh, I just spilled my drink all over my...

1075
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:10,810
Ah!

1076
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,890
Motion capture on his YouTube channel.

1077
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:26,590
Thank you brother.

1078
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,610
Take a bow!

1079
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,830
He actually did!

1080
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,720
And the rest is silence.

1081
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:47,980
Oh, that was mean.

1082
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,040
I don't think I can...

1083
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,880
I want to get something for my health.

1084
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,460
I've always wondered why I like Agnes.

1085
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,060
She's a nerdy little theater kid.

1086
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,160
This stutters.

1087
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,680
It's like looking at a mirror.

1088
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,000
I still got them.

1089
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:16,660
I still got them.

1090
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,120
We're OK.

1091
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:18,720
I was reading.

1092
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:19,980
Thank you for the pig!

1093
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,580
I'm getting a cough drop.

1094
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:28,280
Real quick.

1095
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,120
Real fast.

1096
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:46,510
My money!

1097
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:48,270
My money!

1098
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,090
You really gave me a heart attack.

1099
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:50,670
Me too!

1100
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:53,230
Once I noticed it, I was like...

1101
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:55,830
Oh, tomato!

1102
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:24,890
I think that's what he meant.

1103
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:30,270
I think this place is gonna blow.

1104
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,480
Sorry, I forgot to turn it back down.

1105
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:36,380
Holy cow!

1106
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:39,780
Nice!

1107
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:41,460
Nice!

1108
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,340
86%?

1109
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:45,500
What did I miss?

1110
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,140
B for Binto!

1111
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:52,300
True.

1112
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:10,060
One is not enough.

1113
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:10,800
Keep going.

1114
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:12,380
Blade mode.

1115
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:18,740
It only

1116
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:24,650
split once!

1117
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,990
It didn't even...he missed all the other times.

1118
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:34,950
Hey there.

1119
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:36,250
Oh, trash.

1120
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,770
Is Nero doing OK in there?

1121
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:50,830
Yes, mama.

1122
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:58,830
Got it.

1123
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:00,550
Babe.

1124
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:01,250
B for Brandon.

1125
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:02,130
B for Babe.

1126
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:06,970
9mm kills the body, but 45 ACP kills the soul.

1127
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:10,910
What is that reference to?

1128
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,670
Confront the savior.

1129
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,800
Is there anything I should buy?

1130
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:21,240
I wonder.

1131
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:30,750
I can't even afford it.

1132
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:31,930
Whoosh!

1133
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:39,410
Round trip.

1134
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:40,450
Press and hold Y.

1135
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:43,470
All the rebellion moves.

1136
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,380
I might even refund this.

1137
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,960
Put on normal costume, Dante.

1138
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,500
Long range moves help a lot here.

1139
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,440
I see.

1140
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:08,500
So should we up my guns?

1141
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:11,080
Wait, so like Ebony and Ivory?

1142
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,200
Kind of long range?

1143
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:13,640
We talking?

1144
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,680
Are we talking Charge Shot 3?

1145
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:16,260
We talking?

1146
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:18,980
Or Pandora?

1147
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:19,720
We talking?

1148
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,220
I'm scared.

1149
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,040
Pandora?

1150
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,500
I got that maxed.

1151
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:33,640
Pandora's spinning move is good enough as long as...I just have to make sure I aim.

1152
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,640
Da, da, da, da.

1153
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,800
Gunslinger is worth it.

1154
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,080
Go with the...

1155
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,420
Let's...I can't buy all of them.

1156
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,240
Hold on, I'm gonna refund.

1157
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,420
Sorry Lucifer.

1158
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:52,920
Give me my money back.

1159
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,340
Let's try that.

1160
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,640
Let's try that.

1161
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:06,280
Let's try that.

1162
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,980
Well, I have to see what the mission is anyway, so you know.

1163
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,040
OK, mission is...oh wait.

1164
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:13,780
Mission menu.

1165
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,740
Let's change our outfit.

1166
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,920
Thank you for suggesting.

1167
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:23,640
That was a good suggestion though for the Sparta outfit.

1168
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,180
Thank you.

1169
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,630
The outfit was too good.

1170
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:42,610
I know people were kind of like hinting at like a silly moment would happen.

1171
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:44,610
That outfit would be perfect for it.

1172
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:47,690
But it exceeded my expectation.

1173
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,490
How about death?

1174
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:26,350
Yeah, do all the work for me, cutscene Dante.

1175
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:31,090
Yeah, do all the work for me, cutscene Dante.

1176
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:33,770
Oh wow, went through his legs.

1177
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:36,930
Damn, he opened his legs like he's used to it.

1178
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,520
You ready to eat your words?

1179
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,970
Oh, he's gone now.

1180
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,250
You're too slow.

1181
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:09,650
Wow, why doesn't my gun work like that?

1182
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:17,370
Don't tell me I have to parkour here.

1183
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:26,440
Yamato!

1184
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,620
Katana used by Dante's brother.

1185
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:33,280
It is the key to opening the hell gates, but also the key to their destruction.

1186
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,640
Dark Slayer.

1187
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:39,360
After obtaining Yamato, it can be used with the powerful Dark Slayer style.

1188
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,060
Wait a second, I just spent all my money.

1189
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:49,440
To select Dark Slayer style, press the button of the currently selected style again.

1190
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,240
Wait, what do you mean by that?

1191
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:52,820
Wait, what?

1192
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,000
It's not its own thing?

1193
01:17:59,140 --> 01:17:59,940
Hold on!

1194
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:02,680
Yo, wait!

1195
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:03,060
Wait!

1196
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:03,420
Wait!

1197
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:03,860
Wait!

1198
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:04,220
Wait!

1199
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:05,220
Wait!

1200
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:11,850
Holy hell!

1201
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:13,490
Oh my god.

1202
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,280
What is this?

1203
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:26,480
What?

1204
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,520
Friendly fire!

1205
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,120
I'm not at the beginning, am I?

1206
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,100
Oh wait, that's where I just came from.

1207
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,920
Oh, that's where I just came from!

1208
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:51,880
Hello.

1209
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,420
Oh, that's not what I'm supposed to do.

1210
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,040
Where am I?

1211
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,900
What do I do?

1212
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,600
Oh shoot.

1213
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:21,680
What are you doing out here?

1214
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,780
I'm on your arm now, mister.

1215
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:27,420
I'm running.

1216
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:30,880
Hit

1217
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,430
the blue thingies?

1218
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,210
OK, OK.

1219
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,370
I gotta get on his other arm, no?

1220
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,530
I'm trapped here.

1221
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:51,410
Break it more?

1222
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:51,930
Oh, OK.

1223
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:53,150
Fully break it.

1224
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:53,790
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1225
01:19:58,310 --> 01:19:59,250
Oh, I see, I see.

1226
01:19:59,350 --> 01:19:59,850
Oh, OK.

1227
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,390
I thought I had gotten it.

1228
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:04,010
Thank you guys.

1229
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:07,410
OK.

1230
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:09,550
Oh,

1231
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:23,900
did I get hit mid?

1232
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:24,540
No way.

1233
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,120
Anything up here?

1234
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:29,360
Oh.

1235
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,240
Oh gosh!

1236
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:33,040
Uh-oh.

1237
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,340
Dang it, I missed my chance.

1238
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,180
He just slammed his arm down.

1239
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:42,260
Can I like bait him into... Oh my god.

1240
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:44,600
Friendly fire, friendly fire!

1241
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,480
Go, go, go!

1242
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,640
Wait, no, not you.

1243
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:50,680
Turn around, turn around.

1244
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:51,280
No, not you.

1245
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:52,200
Turn around.

1246
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,280
Oh gosh!

1247
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:54,820
Oh gosh, I'm gonna die here.

1248
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,440
Oh wait, OK.

1249
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:57,620
No, no.

1250
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,320
Oh, wait.

1251
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,320
This is good.

1252
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:00,620
That's good.

1253
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,440
Yeah, that's good.

1254
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:03,380
That's good.

1255
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:05,300
DT!

1256
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,120
Yeah, you're right.

1257
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:06,860
I should DT.

1258
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,420
Oh wait, I'm on the same arm as before.

1259
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,260
And charge!

1260
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,900
Oh, I did it.

1261
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:17,320
Somehow.

1262
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,580
Uh-oh.

1263
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,200
Holy moly.

1264
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,440
Holy moly.

1265
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:38,170
Again, again!

1266
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,730
Oh, I'm still DT'ed.

1267
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:41,850
Oh shoot.

1268
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,320
You know what?

1269
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:46,920
Maybe that's OK.

1270
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:50,800
Can you slam your other arm?

1271
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:55,320
I don't want this one.

1272
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:57,860
Other arm.

1273
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,920
Holy... Wow, that's a critical crotch.

1274
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:04,580
Crotchity, crotch, crotch, crotch, crotch, crotch.

1275
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:05,980
Oh my god.

1276
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,240
Oh wait.

1277
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:09,300
Oh my god, ouch.

1278
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,860
Wait, I'm scared.

1279
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:12,340
Wait, what am I supposed to do here?

1280
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,160
Hit the cannon.

1281
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:15,280
Cannon?

1282
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,300
Fire the cannon?

1283
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:22,600
Use the thing.

1284
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,060
Cannon?

1285
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:26,840
This thing.

1286
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:27,420
Oh!

1287
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:06,890
Chill out!

1288
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:11,130
Wait, what else am I supposed to hit now?

1289
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:14,230
Oh, there's these guys here.

1290
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:15,650
Oh my gosh, I didn't even notice.

1291
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:20,810
What else am I supposed to get?

1292
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:21,310
Hit it more?

1293
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:25,670
There we go,

1294
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,800
there we go.

1295
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,380
I think more, even more, even more.

1296
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,260
Do I have to do that all over again?

1297
01:23:58,460 --> 01:23:59,680
On the leg.

1298
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:00,780
More?

1299
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:06,760
How do I get to his leg?

1300
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,360
Legs and back.

1301
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,080
OK.

1302
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:28,780
I don't think I can reach from here.

1303
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,700
Wait, can I?

1304
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:32,400
I don't think I can reach from here.

1305
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,500
Wait, I'm getting further away.

1306
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,140
I don't think I'm doing this correctly.

1307
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:43,080
There we go.

1308
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:43,880
Climb!

1309
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:44,560
Climb on!

1310
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,660
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1311
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:50,240
Wait, where am I?

1312
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,390
Pistols have better range?

1313
01:24:58,670 --> 01:24:59,530
Probably, no?

1314
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:06,670
Oh my gosh.

1315
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:19,390
Oh my god.

1316
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:21,330
I'm down though, I'm down.

1317
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:23,870
Please, please, leave me alone.

1318
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:25,710
Please, there's too much to worry about here.

1319
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:26,890
Please, please.

1320
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:27,370
Friendly fire!

1321
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:27,970
Friendly fire!

1322
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,170
Friendly fire, please.

1323
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:31,310
There we go.

1324
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:31,950
Oh shoot.

1325
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:33,970
Oh, oh.

1326
01:25:35,810 --> 01:25:36,210
Fire,

1327
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:42,680
friendly fire.

1328
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1329
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,500
Oh, there's another one.

1330
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:47,740
Oh, no, no, no.

1331
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:48,960
Friendly fire, friendly fire, friendly fire.

1332
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:50,100
Friendly fire, friendly fire.

1333
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:03,670
I don't, I don't, I'm confused, you guys.

1334
01:26:04,590 --> 01:26:05,610
I'm so confused.

1335
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:07,030
I'm not gonna lie.

1336
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,230
Oh gosh, I'm gonna die here.

1337
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:11,150
I'm really confused about this part.

1338
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:12,330
Oh!

1339
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:22,380
Like how am I supposed to... I'm confused.

1340
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,380
I'm just gonna keep moving around.

1341
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,720
The cannon?

1342
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,040
Again?

1343
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,000
Oh god, where was it?

1344
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:50,400
You can use Yamato by pressing the style button twice.

1345
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:53,740
Like that button?

1346
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,560
Or that button?

1347
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,700
Oh, I'm Dark Slayer now.

1348
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,220
Wait, but what does Yamato do?

1349
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,660
Now use B.

1350
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,260
Good stuff.

1351
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,920
Oh nice, that actually was so good.

1352
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:19,740
That was actually so good.

1353
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:20,620
Am I supposed to...

1354
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:22,620
Get up on the Hydra's back!

1355
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,860
I'm so confused.

1356
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:28,760
Oh gosh.

1357
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,080
I don't... Wait, this is the cannon.

1358
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:55,470
Where's your back?

1359
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:56,930
Where's your back, buddy?

1360
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,690
It won't let me on him.

1361
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:01,530
Oh gosh, where do I go?

1362
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:19,680
Where's more?

1363
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:21,400
More, more, more.

1364
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,180
Oh god.

1365
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,280
Hey, leave me alone.

1366
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,060
I'm lost.

1367
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,260
Wait, I can't even see him now.

1368
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:27,980
I can't move the camera.

1369
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,140
Where'd he go?

1370
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,280
Okay, I'm back where I started.

1371
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,380
Now the legs.

1372
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:34,040
Okay, we gotta get...

1373
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:37,140
Shotty got low, low, low, low, low, low.

1374
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:39,940
Where though?

1375
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,120
How do I get downstairs?

1376
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:44,040
Hold B.

1377
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,080
Oh, here we go, here we go.

1378
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,560
Okay, I got that one.

1379
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,240
Hold B?

1380
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,420
I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm holding.

1381
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,060
No, please.

1382
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,080
I don't care about you.

1383
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,320
Please.

1384
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,440
Okay,

1385
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,220
back to the cannon.

1386
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,560
Back to the cannon.

1387
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:13,520
Somewhere.

1388
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:14,760
Maybe behind me.

1389
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:31,750
Okay, I gotta get down, down there.

1390
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:34,390
Wow, wow.

1391
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:38,130
Okay,

1392
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,130
get on the savior's back.

1393
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:48,470
Okay, that should be all of them but the chest, right?

1394
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:51,930
That doesn't seem...

1395
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:54,150
That doesn't seem good, that doesn't seem good, that doesn't seem good.

1396
01:29:56,570 --> 01:29:57,310
I

1397
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:12,560
can't see anything right now.

1398
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:13,160
There we go.

1399
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,060
Do I go back to the...

1400
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:19,600
No?

1401
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:21,400
That's it.

1402
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:22,840
Holy cow.

1403
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:24,040
Oh my god.

1404
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:25,900
That was so...

1405
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:32,880
That was so... Oh no.

1406
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:33,920
Oh no.

1407
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:34,980
Oh no.

1408
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:40,540
Phase two.

1409
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,460
Wait.

1410
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,460
Can I... Wait.

1411
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:50,680
Circle, circle.

1412
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:52,160
Wait, how do I use this thing again?

1413
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:52,840
Circle, circle.

1414
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:58,320
Circle, circle.

1415
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,140
Oh wait, I'm not on it.

1416
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:05,740
Somehow...

1417
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:10,570
Use the pistol?

1418
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:11,110
Really?

1419
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:19,890
Hold on, I'm just running around in here.

1420
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:37,460
He's so scary.

1421
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:40,160
You missed me slowpoke.

1422
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:46,240
What if I just jump between two things?

1423
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:50,880
Am I even hitting him?

1424
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,360
Oh no, he broke it.

1425
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:54,560
Oh no!

1426
01:32:03,770 --> 01:32:04,810
Where are you?

1427
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:06,450
Where are you mister?

1428
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:19,900
Oh shoot.

1429
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,700
Oh my god.

1430
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,180
This garage...

1431
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:28,740
Where did he go?

1432
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:32,940
Oh my god.

1433
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,740
Run, run, run, run.

1434
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:34,180
Run, run, run Dante.

1435
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,160
Wait, is he moving it?

1436
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:42,840
No.

1437
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:44,200
I don't think so.

1438
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:44,480
No.

1439
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,820
Ok, it stays in one place.

1440
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:46,500
That's enough.

1441
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,000
Oh my god.

1442
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,000
Oh my god.

1443
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:59,090
Oh my god.

1444
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,260
How am I supposed to...

1445
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,480
Oh shoot!

1446
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,320
Wait, please don't.

1447
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,600
Oh my god.

1448
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:23,060
I need to use... I need to use trickster or something for some of these...

1449
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,120
Damn attacks.

1450
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:25,740
He sucks so much.

1451
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:32,600
Like I need to stay so close to...

1452
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:44,260
Oh thanks for the warp.

1453
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,760
Oh dang it, I just...

1454
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:02,480
Ok, run, run, run, run, run.

1455
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:11,060
I think he is about to destroy that one too, no?

1456
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:31,170
This is DMC2, right?

1457
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:36,310
That was so stinking close.

1458
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,000
Get like two hits in and I'm...

1459
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,160
This is stupid.

1460
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:58,280
This fight is so stupid.

1461
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,160
This is a method.

1462
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,080
Yeah, you're telling me.

1463
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,400
You're telling me.

1464
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:38,170
Go, go, go!

1465
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:46,600
Go, go.

1466
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:50,400
Health bar, go down tiny bit.

1467
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:50,920
Tiny...

1468
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:51,160
Ah!

1469
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:55,700
I tried.

1470
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:59,200
Sometimes you get stun locked in like the...

1471
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,500
When you use gunslinger.

1472
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:02,920
The style.

1473
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,760
This is so stupid.

1474
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,740
Please let me DT again, please.

1475
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,700
Please let me DT again.

1476
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:55,640
Is he regaining health?

1477
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,300
I can't tell.

1478
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:02,730
I feel like I'm getting nowhere.

1479
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,430
She'll find it.

1480
01:37:05,470 --> 01:37:06,270
Wait, find what?

1481
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:08,430
There's something?

1482
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:10,570
Put me out of my misery.

1483
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:14,570
It's just very slow.

1484
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:23,500
Keep going, this way.

1485
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,340
I'm gonna die though, I'm gonna die.

1486
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:27,720
I'm gonna lose health.

1487
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:33,310
I wish I could go faster.

1488
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:35,850
Is there a cannon or something?

1489
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:37,930
Oh god.

1490
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,800
Wait, run, run, run, run.

1491
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,580
Oh shoot, I'm stuck.

1492
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,580
Wait, I'm stuck.

1493
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:54,980
I'm stuck.

1494
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,840
Stay there.

1495
01:37:58,220 --> 01:37:58,460
Here?

1496
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:00,660
Oh,

1497
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:10,970
I'm gonna die.

1498
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:12,030
I'm gonna die.

1499
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:13,830
I'm gonna die.

1500
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:26,750
Restart?

1501
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:27,670
I don't think so.

1502
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:29,670
Hell no, I think I'd rather use items.

1503
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:32,210
In fact, I'm gonna do this.

1504
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:36,950
Hold on.

1505
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:40,470
Can I holy water him?

1506
01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:43,510
Can I holy water him?

1507
01:38:43,570 --> 01:38:44,330
Is he close enough?

1508
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:48,490
Okay, I'm just gonna use the big boy.

1509
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:51,830
Keep going left?

1510
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:53,590
I don't think I can, can I?

1511
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:57,130
Wait, what do you mean to... Oh no, he's too far?

1512
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:57,510
Okay.

1513
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:10,190
You can stinger input with... I don't... I tried using Yamato, I don't... Wait.

1514
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:13,070
I don't know how to use it.

1515
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:16,630
Wait.

1516
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:17,410
Oh!

1517
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:23,090
Okay, that was really good.

1518
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:37,010
Like here?

1519
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:39,370
Wait, stay there and fight.

1520
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:41,690
What do you mean Mito?

1521
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:42,770
I don't know.

1522
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:44,310
I don't know this fight.

1523
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:46,850
You guys can't be like Mito.

1524
01:39:47,470 --> 01:39:48,400
I'm just trying...

1525
01:39:54,230 --> 01:39:54,850
No,

1526
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:00,000
I was on a melee platform.

1527
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:01,300
I didn't know.

1528
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,120
Maybe I should just restart.

1529
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:07,360
I have no motivation.

1530
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:08,780
Where is your motivation?

1531
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:11,720
Wait.

1532
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:18,260
I'm trying to stinger him.

1533
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:26,440
I'm back.

1534
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,400
Guys, I'm just getting my ass kicked.

1535
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,060
For real.

1536
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:39,560
I'm just getting my ass kicked.

1537
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,820
I tried.

1538
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,620
He just comboed me.

1539
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:50,180
I did press B.

1540
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,440
Is Dark Slayer not Yamato?

1541
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:03,120
Is Dark Slayer not Yamato?

1542
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:08,990
It is.

1543
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:11,430
Yeah, so then I am...

1544
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:16,310
I wasted my... I wasted my health.

1545
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:18,370
I wasted my heal.

1546
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:26,660
Oh well.

1547
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:31,610
Wait, he's down!

1548
01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:33,250
Go Dante, go!

1549
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:42,680
Please, do it!

1550
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:43,380
Do it!

1551
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:44,200
I don't

1552
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,320
know what that was.

1553
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,160
What?

1554
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:52,600
Wait.

1555
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:01,700
Oh my gosh.

1556
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,820
I for some reason thought that they would...

1557
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:08,360
not go through... that they would be blocked by...

1558
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:12,780
It worked?

1559
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:13,540
Did that work?

1560
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:24,980
Oh no!

1561
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:26,780
I was too far!

1562
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:30,080
Oh, we made some good damage there though.

1563
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:30,920
OK, that's good.

1564
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:32,960
Nice.

1565
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:38,460
I at

1566
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:45,460
least made some good damage there.

1567
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:52,940
Oh...

1568
01:42:59,000 --> 01:42:59,920
Dante, you're shaking.

1569
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:07,140
I don't even know where I'm going.

1570
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:09,420
I don't even know where I'm going.

1571
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:13,920
Stop jumping around.

1572
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,040
I'm just trying not to die!

1573
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:17,280
I'm just trying not to die here.

1574
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,580
Oh, I'm trapped.

1575
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:21,780
Oh, I'm trapped.

1576
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:23,900
Guys, this is it.

1577
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,100
Oh!

1578
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:47,260
Please, come here.

1579
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:48,560
Come here, come here, come here.

1580
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:49,580
Come here, come here.

1581
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:49,960
Wait.

1582
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:05,360
Oh, this is the platform.

1583
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,080
Wait, is this

1584
01:44:20,770 --> 01:44:21,210
the platform?

1585
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:22,450
I don't know anymore.

1586
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,140
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1587
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:31,940
Oh my god.

1588
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:36,390
Oh, we're so close.

1589
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:38,730
Why won't he do his little thingy again with his face?

1590
01:44:52,110 --> 01:44:54,370
OK, we locked him.

1591
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:55,670
We stun locked him again.

1592
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,450
OK, let's go and do our big cut.

1593
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:00,050
Big cut time!

1594
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:08,140
Holy cow.

1595
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:17,020
Oh god.

1596
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:28,200
Oh!

1597
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:40,060
OK, so once I knew you could melee him on there...

1598
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:43,260
It wasn't as bad, but I was so... That was definitely a designed boss.

1599
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:51,780
Nero!

1600
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,340
Little baby.

1601
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:55,860
Very gimmicky boss.

1602
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:59,940
Oh, he's gonna be birthed.

1603
01:46:11,090 --> 01:46:13,730
A baby is born.

1604
01:46:20,350 --> 01:46:23,250
He's a healthy baby boy.

1605
01:46:31,210 --> 01:46:34,770
Wait, wait.

1606
01:46:34,810 --> 01:46:35,530
What about Kitty A?

1607
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,950
Is she dead dead?

1608
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:39,170
Yes, I will save her.

1609
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:46,390
Let's clean up this mess.

1610
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:47,210
Nero!

1611
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:55,800
That only took 20 minutes?

1612
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:59,620
Why did it feel like I was on that for like 3 hours?

1613
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:03,800
It felt like I was there for like...

1614
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:06,140
Forever.

1615
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:10,160
That felt so long.

1616
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:14,900
It's a boring fight.

1617
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:17,920
Oh my gosh, it felt like...

1618
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,020
T for Dante!

1619
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,720
It's a confusing mission.

1620
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,220
Thank you guys for trying to help.

1621
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:35,460
I just...

1622
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:35,700
What?

1623
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:42,920
They're like...

1624
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:46,580
You gotta get the blue things, but I don't know how to get the blue things.

1625
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:48,600
Then you gotta do other things.

1626
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:51,340
Thank you for the raid, Hunter.

1627
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:03,090
I'm gonna get this done.

1628
01:48:03,090 --> 01:48:05,390
Good luck...Kid.

1629
01:48:06,810 --> 01:48:08,330
Frog for Rabbit, thank you so much for the buy.

1630
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:09,390
Thank you!

1631
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:14,600
Don't call me Kid.

1632
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:18,700
Can I now power up Yamato?

1633
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:21,640
There he is.

1634
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:23,020
What can we get?

1635
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,120
When did I suddenly get all...

1636
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:29,020
I was like when did I suddenly get 18,000?

1637
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:35,160
While Devil Trigger is active, the depletion of the DT gauge will be reduced.

1638
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,740
Oh wait, that's Trigger Heart.

1639
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:44,690
Maximum bet when Devil Trigger is active.

1640
01:48:45,150 --> 01:48:45,810
Press on the ground.

1641
01:48:46,690 --> 01:48:47,890
Y plus B.

1642
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:51,970
Oh gosh, these are like gamer moves.

1643
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:54,110
These are...

1644
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:54,290
What?

1645
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:01,890
You realize you're Nero again, yes?

1646
01:49:02,050 --> 01:49:03,950
Yeah, that's why I said I refunded everything.

1647
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:07,070
So we gotta get all our stuff back.

1648
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:09,650
I'm assuming?

1649
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:10,730
Wait a second.

1650
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:13,030
Oh no, nevermind.

1651
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:15,950
Refunded only our...

1652
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:17,850
Oh, I thought I would refund everything.

1653
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:21,250
Oh, I guess that makes sense because Trigger Heart is still...

1654
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:22,470
Ah, nice!

1655
01:49:23,470 --> 01:49:24,470
Okay, cool.

1656
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:29,790
My birthday offering...

1657
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:34,470
To my favorite gamer, ghost maid, cat girl, devil hunter...

1658
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:37,570
Kamrinin, happy birthday!

1659
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:41,130
Happy birthday to you.

1660
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:43,690
Happy birthday to you.

1661
01:49:44,290 --> 01:49:47,430
Happy birthday Kamrinin.

1662
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,970
Happy birthday to you.

1663
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:53,290
Happy birthday!

1664
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:56,070
Happy, happy birthday.

1665
01:49:58,330 --> 01:49:59,630
Okay, let's see.

1666
01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:01,250
Well, that's nice that it...

1667
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:04,250
I think because when we switched to Dante...

1668
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:08,190
It gave us all of our orbs from Nero.

1669
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:12,410
I just assumed that it was like refunding them.

1670
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:14,450
But that's nice that it actually kept them.

1671
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:15,290
Okay, cool.

1672
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:19,530
And so...

1673
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:20,910
Oh, snatch.

1674
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:21,850
Yes!

1675
01:50:23,430 --> 01:50:25,930
XP share while Dante played his campaign.

1676
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:28,570
Yeah, it's like that, right?

1677
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,330
It refunds the other character's ones.

1678
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:32,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1679
01:50:33,170 --> 01:50:35,390
Well, should we get...

1680
01:50:35,390 --> 01:50:37,310
I will try to use this.

1681
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:40,610
I will try.

1682
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:45,030
While on the ground, press RB, back.

1683
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:46,990
Then YB.

1684
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:50,170
Is it like YB at the same time?

1685
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:51,550
Or Y and then plus B?

1686
01:50:53,010 --> 01:50:53,710
One year!

1687
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:55,190
Thank you!

1688
01:50:57,210 --> 01:50:59,250
Game was like, sorry, that boss sucked.

1689
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:00,130
Here's your money back.

1690
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:03,790
Same time, okay.

1691
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,250
But it has to be while in Devil Trigger.

1692
01:51:06,450 --> 01:51:08,050
Both of these are when in Devil Trigger.

1693
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:09,390
Okay.

1694
01:51:18,110 --> 01:51:20,530
Okay, this is our...

1695
01:51:21,370 --> 01:51:23,270
Our stinger.

1696
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:29,010
But now we have the grabby grab, so honestly...

1697
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:29,990
Who needs a stinger?

1698
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:34,290
Can't use Yamato without DT, okay.

1699
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:42,060
Let me grab this one too.

1700
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:49,290
Can't wait for the next year for me to fly.

1701
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:50,390
Sure, steer!

1702
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:51,650
Thank you!

1703
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:54,270
Y and Y, Y.

1704
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:01,280
You know what, maybe... We have so much now.

1705
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,700
Why don't I just get a bunch of stuff?

1706
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:05,700
Y.

1707
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:08,080
Okay, let's get this too.

1708
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,240
Caliber is fun.

1709
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,820
Back to forward is like what will probably mess me up though.

1710
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,900
I feel that it doesn't hurt to have stuff.

1711
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:24,840
Because if I accidentally do the combo then...

1712
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:26,380
We're winning.

1713
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,020
Because I have it.

1714
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:30,360
Okay, I was just making sure.

1715
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:32,000
I have all the stuff for Blue Rose.

1716
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:33,560
I have the stuff for Devil Bringer.

1717
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:38,760
I'll try it.

1718
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:50,250
Okay.

1719
01:52:51,190 --> 01:52:52,490
That is not incorrect.

1720
01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:55,590
The next missions will throw a lot at you.

1721
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:56,170
Be prepared.

1722
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:57,470
Oh golly.

1723
01:52:57,870 --> 01:52:58,410
What, we have what?

1724
01:52:58,490 --> 01:52:58,930
Three missions?

1725
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:00,330
Wait, no.

1726
01:53:00,910 --> 01:53:01,830
What one is this?

1727
01:53:02,010 --> 01:53:03,590
Actually, where are we?

1728
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:08,070
I'm gonna buy more stars since I used one here.

1729
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:11,150
And I used a big one.

1730
01:53:11,670 --> 01:53:12,690
Buy that back.

1731
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:16,270
I guess I could have used devil stars during that last thing too.

1732
01:53:16,510 --> 01:53:17,890
But it all worked out.

1733
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:20,010
In the end, it worked out.

1734
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:24,820
Buy two?

1735
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:26,060
Really?

1736
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:26,780
Buy two?

1737
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:30,440
Two of the vital stars?

1738
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:31,740
Why not?

1739
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:33,020
We got robes to spare.

1740
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:37,800
Oh yeah, we have two missions.

1741
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,460
Surmount the stairs of tribulation.

1742
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,620
That doesn't sound good.

1743
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:47,220
That?

1744
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:48,820
That's a boss rush.

1745
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,660
Ogre this level!

1746
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:02,680
Oh, Capcom boss rush.

1747
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:04,600
No!

1748
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:12,850
No, wait!

1749
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:14,690
No!

1750
01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:16,870
No!

1751
01:54:21,970 --> 01:54:25,550
I've been suffering with bad mental recently.

1752
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:26,430
No, Phil!

1753
01:54:28,350 --> 01:54:29,050
A lie!

1754
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:31,330
The stairway to heaven or hell.

1755
01:54:31,790 --> 01:54:33,090
Thanks for the super chat by the way.

1756
01:54:33,150 --> 01:54:33,610
Thank you so much.

1757
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:34,370
I hope you feel better.

1758
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:39,730
Know that we control it and all will be well.

1759
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:46,350
If it is progress that you desire, moving your other self past the stairs is required.

1760
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:49,250
And now your fate we decide.

1761
01:54:49,470 --> 01:54:51,330
Strike us or your progress will be denied!

1762
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:58,120
No kidding, huh?

1763
01:54:58,220 --> 01:54:59,180
Wait, is this all luck?

1764
01:54:59,260 --> 01:54:59,800
No way.

1765
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:02,820
Thank you!

1766
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:16,830
Yippee!

1767
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:37,910
Does it matter when I hit it?

1768
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:45,130
The numbers will go in a set pattern and whatever is on top when you hit is the number you get.

1769
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:49,450
Yellow seems good.

1770
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:52,350
Wait, ok, it's so fast.

1771
01:55:54,710 --> 01:55:55,770
Did I get it?

1772
01:55:56,090 --> 01:55:56,910
Was I too slow?

1773
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:58,310
I was too slow.

1774
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:03,950
Well, that's not bad.

1775
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:05,410
Yippee!

1776
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:15,310
You have to use B.

1777
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:16,670
Really?

1778
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:34,310
Oh wait, I was... I'm an idiot.

1779
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:35,490
I'm so stupid.

1780
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:37,750
Oh, I'm dumb.

1781
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:38,930
I'm really stupid.

1782
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:43,590
Oh, I'm really dumb.

1783
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:50,040
Why?

1784
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:50,620
Why?

1785
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:51,340
Why?

1786
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:52,080
Why?

1787
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:58,180
Why was it... I was literally one track mind.

1788
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:07,320
It's coming so fast.

1789
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,520
We're just... We're farming.

1790
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:24,780
Obviously.

1791
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:27,360
Ok, yellow.

1792
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:31,200
One, two, three.

1793
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:32,000
Alright, three.

1794
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:42,920
Four?

1795
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:47,360
Oh, I didn't count the purple.

1796
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:51,980
Yippee!

1797
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:58,900
Ok,

1798
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:03,980
one.

1799
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,740
Ok, ok, I'm paying attention.

1800
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:14,880
I'm paying attention.

1801
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:16,280
It's after five.

1802
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:17,200
Five of...

1803
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:19,400
Ok.

1804
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:22,360
Well, white is nothing.

1805
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:23,600
Blue is orbs.

1806
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,600
Purple is the goal.

1807
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:25,700
Red is enemies.

1808
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,240
Yellow will also take you to the goal.

1809
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:45,220
Come on!

1810
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:45,920
Let me have your sword!

1811
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:46,760
Or your shield, please!

1812
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:51,420
They're all such a little hive mind.

1813
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,740
Why?

1814
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:04,800
Oh my gosh, we haven't heard this song in a bit.

1815
01:59:07,570 --> 01:59:08,010
Come on!

1816
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:08,230
Come on!

1817
01:59:08,270 --> 01:59:09,250
Oh, please, let me leave.

1818
01:59:10,130 --> 01:59:11,090
Ok, hold on.

1819
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:21,160
Am I doing it?

1820
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:31,180
I did it!

1821
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:38,590
Oh, shoot.

1822
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:44,920
I'm such an idiot.

1823
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,040
I should've...

1824
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,020
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1825
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:48,520
Stop.

1826
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:49,900
Oh my god, please.

1827
01:59:50,540 --> 01:59:51,780
Mister, mister, mister, mister.

1828
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,100
I can't see anything.

1829
01:59:58,040 --> 01:59:59,280
Please be gone.

1830
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:00,720
Please be gone.

1831
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:01,440
Please be gone.

1832
02:00:03,700 --> 02:00:05,300
I don't remember how to take your shield.

1833
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:11,580
Can I at least kill one of you, please?

1834
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:12,920
Oh, thank you.

1835
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:16,960
Ask and you shall receive.

1836
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:17,900
Receive.

1837
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:28,240
Ask and you shall receive.

1838
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:32,940
Wait, I can now grab you.

1839
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:38,570
And you too!

1840
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:39,990
Suplex!

1841
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:45,250
You can grab them from the back.

1842
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:47,630
Thank you.

1843
02:00:50,630 --> 02:00:51,490
Smoking.

1844
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:53,250
Did we really get to smoking?

1845
02:00:53,730 --> 02:00:54,490
Nice finish.

1846
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:05,310
A little grove over there.

1847
02:01:05,690 --> 02:01:06,710
And a little...

1848
02:01:08,430 --> 02:01:09,010
War?

1849
02:01:10,650 --> 02:01:15,870
Wait, so yellow is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1850
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:18,330
What's the difference between getting purple and getting yellow?

1851
02:01:18,450 --> 02:01:18,650
Anything?

1852
02:01:22,010 --> 02:01:24,470
What's the difference between purple and... Is it the same?

1853
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:27,130
Nothing.

1854
02:01:27,570 --> 02:01:28,350
Oh, no diff.

1855
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,540
Yellow an instant cheat to the finish.

1856
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:35,620
Purple the finish.

1857
02:01:35,820 --> 02:01:37,000
I see.

1858
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:43,080
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1859
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:44,720
We'll do 5 or 6.

1860
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:45,600
I guess it doesn't matter.

1861
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,660
Oh, it's so fast now.

1862
02:01:59,350 --> 02:02:02,110
You're not supposed to cheat the dice so it gives better odds.

1863
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:15,360
Oh, golly.

1864
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:16,300
Okay.

1865
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:20,640
I'm trying to remember how to fight him.

1866
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:25,540
How do I jump?

1867
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:39,120
Maybe I'm too slow with it.

1868
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:41,920
Ah, come on!

1869
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:50,070
I'll jump.

1870
02:02:52,690 --> 02:02:53,890
I jumped!

1871
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:55,290
Seriously?

1872
02:02:57,850 --> 02:02:58,870
He's parrying.

1873
02:02:59,430 --> 02:03:01,330
What a stinker.

1874
02:03:05,530 --> 02:03:06,550
Please don't.

1875
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:18,320
You didn't think you could defeat a Capcom game without a boss rush?

1876
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:23,220
It's actually my least favorite mechanic ever.

1877
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:26,820
It's my least favorite thing ever.

1878
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:28,140
I'm not gonna lie.

1879
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:31,500
Doing boss rushes is just so... I don't know.

1880
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:36,240
I get why some people would like it, but...

1881
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:37,320
It's so...

1882
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:43,420
Yeah, it really just does feel like filler.

1883
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:51,040
I don't wanna jump.

1884
02:03:58,820 --> 02:04:00,720
I'll get health back if anything.

1885
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:02,200
Oh, come on!

1886
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:07,020
The guy changed his direction.

1887
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:09,240
I feel like I'm gonna die here.

1888
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:11,980
It's to show how much you've grown.

1889
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:12,940
I hate it.

1890
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:15,100
I already went through the trials.

1891
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:21,600
I love boss rushes, but I think they should be mostly optional.

1892
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:23,880
Yeah, I can agree with that.

1893
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:28,320
I hate growth.

1894
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:29,020
Yeah!

1895
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:32,540
I haven't grown since elementary school!

1896
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:43,580
I think I'm gonna die.

1897
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:47,140
Oh my god.

1898
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,040
Why aren't you grabbing him?

1899
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:53,280
Oh, I'm not gonna lie.

1900
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:54,700
I forgot that I had that option.

1901
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:04,320
I'm gonna die.

1902
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:17,980
This sucks.

1903
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:19,740
This sucks.

1904
02:05:21,740 --> 02:05:22,780
This sucks.

1905
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:27,160
No way.

1906
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:33,540
Wait, no, I'm trying to...

1907
02:06:04,220 --> 02:06:05,800
Get his ass!

1908
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:06,600
Get his ass!

1909
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:07,160
Get his ass!

1910
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:07,480
Literally!

1911
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:08,720
Get his ass!

1912
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:09,040
Literally!

1913
02:06:10,660 --> 02:06:11,540
Oh, ouch, ouch.

1914
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:15,680
He's so close.

1915
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:18,980
You bitch.

1916
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:31,000
I didn't get the finish clap.

1917
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:44,040
One down out of how many?

1918
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:52,200
When you say you haven't grown since elementary school, do you mean mentally or physically?

1919
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:54,320
Both, probably.

1920
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:59,520
Wow, they're like, you need to grow orbs.

1921
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:00,300
We know it.

1922
02:07:02,420 --> 02:07:04,120
How fast is this thing gonna get, anyway?

1923
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:06,720
I wish I could cheat this section.

1924
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:08,160
How many more are there?

1925
02:07:18,710 --> 02:07:21,910
Boss rushes are only fun when you're super OP and get to vent your frustration.

1926
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:28,710
OK, after one.

1927
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:36,610
Ah.

1928
02:07:58,130 --> 02:08:01,030
And this is the third time I've had to fight this guy, even.

1929
02:08:01,310 --> 02:08:03,050
Like, don't even.

1930
02:08:06,430 --> 02:08:08,290
Don't make me fight him again!

1931
02:08:10,550 --> 02:08:12,930
Actually, wait, also the other guy.

1932
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:19,810
It's the third of every boss.

1933
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:20,570
You're right!

1934
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:23,370
Yeah, because we had to... Oh my gosh, dude.

1935
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:30,440
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1936
02:08:32,420 --> 02:08:33,640
Is he gonna do it?

1937
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:35,440
Too far away.

1938
02:08:49,290 --> 02:08:52,170
I have to save some DT just in case I get caught.

1939
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:56,380
Where is he?

1940
02:08:57,420 --> 02:08:58,100
Where'd they go?

1941
02:08:58,620 --> 02:08:59,220
Where is he?

1942
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:00,960
Where'd they go?

1943
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:01,440
Oh.

1944
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:04,360
Where are they?

1945
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:06,880
No!

1946
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:11,570
That was close.

1947
02:09:25,410 --> 02:09:26,750
Stop spinning!

1948
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:31,110
Oh, no, no, no!

1949
02:09:31,490 --> 02:09:32,270
That was close.

1950
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:36,450
Get away from me, sexy ladies.

1951
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:37,810
I'm not in the mood.

1952
02:09:38,930 --> 02:09:41,210
I have a headache.

1953
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:04,680
Nero only cares about one woman.

1954
02:10:04,820 --> 02:10:07,280
He's so... He's so dedicated.

1955
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,140
Oh

1956
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:18,850
my god, that's so lame.

1957
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:30,160
I was already DT'd.

1958
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:31,960
And then I...

1959
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:34,400
Again!

1960
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:43,450
Please let me live.

1961
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:44,930
Please let me live.

1962
02:10:50,370 --> 02:10:51,670
No, please, please, no.

1963
02:10:51,770 --> 02:10:52,250
Get me again.

1964
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:02,190
Oh my gosh.

1965
02:11:03,610 --> 02:11:04,410
I'm scared.

1966
02:11:04,570 --> 02:11:05,970
I feel like I'm gonna die again.

1967
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:09,710
Get up on the hydra's back.

1968
02:11:22,770 --> 02:11:26,070
If they don't give me like a place to...

1969
02:11:26,070 --> 02:11:30,470
Be able to buy more stuff, I'm gonna be so...

1970
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:32,790
I'm gonna be so... It's so over for me.

1971
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:49,050
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1972
02:11:49,850 --> 02:11:51,390
Oh, it's gonna be so over for me.

1973
02:11:54,470 --> 02:11:57,190
I lose all motivation in these kinds of fights.

1974
02:11:57,590 --> 02:11:59,750
Where it's like just...

1975
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:01,770
Just redoing stuff.

1976
02:12:02,230 --> 02:12:04,290
It's just not fun for me.

1977
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:06,850
I've already done this fight so many times.

1978
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:14,520
If I'm playing the game again, like that's one thing.

1979
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:18,380
This is so lame.

1980
02:12:19,180 --> 02:12:20,780
This is so stinking lame.

1981
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:22,360
Sorry to complain all the time.

1982
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:23,300
I just hate this.

1983
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:24,920
I hate this!

1984
02:12:35,190 --> 02:12:36,510
Please, come here.

1985
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:52,450
Where did you come from?

1986
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:19,920
Oh, come on.

1987
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:35,260
No, please.

1988
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:53,720
This gets done now.

1989
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,540
I tried to dodge.

1990
02:14:15,150 --> 02:14:16,930
There's no... I don't know.

1991
02:14:17,150 --> 02:14:17,590
I don't know.

1992
02:14:17,950 --> 02:14:18,890
I don't know.

1993
02:14:19,230 --> 02:14:20,670
This is actually so unfair.

1994
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:22,550
This is actually so unfair.

1995
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:56,080
What the... Why are you on the ground?

1996
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:57,160
Are you waiting for me?

1997
02:14:58,600 --> 02:15:00,120
Is this an imitation, maybe?

1998
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,820
I'll take the rorps, though.

1999
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:19,880
I don't even understand logically why we're fighting them again.

2000
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,940
Did we not close the portal and kill them and do all that good stuff?

2001
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:26,100
This doesn't even make any sense.

2002
02:15:56,090 --> 02:15:57,010
What's happening?

2003
02:15:57,630 --> 02:15:58,930
Why couldn't I attack for a second?

2004
02:16:02,590 --> 02:16:04,330
I tried to grab him.

2005
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:44,540
He was one of the bosses I didn't really have an issue with so much.

2006
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,460
Last time even, so now I'm like...

2007
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:52,460
Feeling a little nervous.

2008
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:56,740
Feeling a little nervous.

2009
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:03,340
The demons are using the power of lack of time and budget to come back.

2010
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:04,560
It's so true.

2011
02:17:05,440 --> 02:17:08,560
1, 2, 3, 4...

2012
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:12,240
OK, after 1.

2013
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:17,940
I went on 1.

2014
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:38,040
Taking my anger out on these guys a little bit.

2015
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:38,940
Come here.

2016
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,780
Taking my anger out on you!

2017
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:44,260
Just a little bit!

2018
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:54,520
Actually, this is kind of good to regain, I guess...

2019
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:55,060
DT.

2020
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,120
Hey,

2021
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:03,360
stop it.

2022
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:05,900
Stop doing that.

2023
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:09,920
This pug.

2024
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:13,920
There we go.

2025
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:28,460
Let's see if we...

2026
02:18:28,460 --> 02:18:31,120
Will we get health if I go to the blue?

2027
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:37,730
After 4.

2028
02:18:41,030 --> 02:18:41,490
Yes?

2029
02:18:41,910 --> 02:18:42,610
Oh, sometimes.

2030
02:18:43,450 --> 02:18:44,530
OK, let's try that then.

2031
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:48,130
A little bit pause...

2032
02:18:48,130 --> 02:18:49,070
Oh yeah, that's right!

2033
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:49,840
I remember that...

2034
02:18:50,430 --> 02:18:52,770
I remember there's some of it falling from the sky.

2035
02:18:55,810 --> 02:18:58,770
OK, OK, OK.

2036
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:01,390
Now we just need to do 1.

2037
02:19:03,390 --> 02:19:05,690
Which is after...

2038
02:19:05,690 --> 02:19:07,730
No, wait.

2039
02:19:08,530 --> 02:19:10,690
Wait, I keep missing it.

2040
02:19:11,970 --> 02:19:13,710
5, after 5.

2041
02:19:17,710 --> 02:19:19,690
Doing the big combo.

2042
02:19:25,730 --> 02:19:27,030
Here we go!

2043
02:19:27,630 --> 02:19:28,650
Oh, goodness.

2044
02:19:28,650 --> 02:19:28,790
Oh, goodness.

2045
02:19:31,670 --> 02:19:32,630
Thank you, lady.

2046
02:19:33,510 --> 02:19:34,430
Oh my goodness.

2047
02:19:35,170 --> 02:19:39,810
I don't remember how to dodge very well as Nero.

2048
02:19:50,150 --> 02:19:50,930
Just jump?

2049
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:52,970
Oh, that's what I'm doing.

2050
02:19:56,500 --> 02:19:57,560
Oh, what am I doing?

2051
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:14,600
Oh, she's really spitting them out this time.

2052
02:20:20,470 --> 02:20:21,510
Wait, grab?

2053
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:26,490
Ouch.

2054
02:20:27,030 --> 02:20:29,150
The trick

2055
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:49,860
with her is just staying up in the air.

2056
02:21:14,740 --> 02:21:15,960
Oh, stop it, stop it!

2057
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:16,800
Please let me hit you.

2058
02:21:23,770 --> 02:21:24,170
OK.

2059
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:35,900
Holy...

2060
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:36,820
Oh, shoot.

2061
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,520
I can't tell you what I can't do.

2062
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:45,040
Oh, shoot.

2063
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:45,460
OK.

2064
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:46,940
That's what she does.

2065
02:21:51,470 --> 02:21:52,590
Please, let me hit you.

2066
02:21:52,870 --> 02:21:54,550
Please, let me hit you.

2067
02:21:54,770 --> 02:21:56,270
Please, let me hit you.

2068
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:01,410
Oh, please.

2069
02:22:01,950 --> 02:22:02,570
There we go.

2070
02:22:10,610 --> 02:22:11,990
I thought that would be enough.

2071
02:22:21,170 --> 02:22:21,690
Please.

2072
02:22:21,690 --> 02:22:22,470
So close.

2073
02:22:22,770 --> 02:22:23,630
So close!

2074
02:22:24,350 --> 02:22:24,750
Alright.

2075
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:41,060
She's like the easiest out of everybody, I think.

2076
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:57,180
She's super duper easy.

2077
02:22:57,260 --> 02:22:58,080
Oh, there we go.

2078
02:22:58,980 --> 02:22:59,360
Nero?

2079
02:23:00,520 --> 02:23:00,960
Nero?

2080
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:03,480
Oh, the sun is shining!

2081
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:06,680
How many more bosses are there?

2082
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:09,640
Do I have to also go with the Angus Beef?

2083
02:23:09,820 --> 02:23:10,940
Do I have to fight him again too?

2084
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:18,640
Aggression with Nero is rewarded a lot because when you stun the bosses you can grab them.

2085
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:20,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2086
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:20,080
Let's go.

2087
02:23:25,950 --> 02:23:28,030
One last guy before the final boss.

2088
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:29,450
Wait, final?

2089
02:23:29,610 --> 02:23:32,310
Like, final of the game or final of this mission?

2090
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:42,640
Final of the game!

2091
02:23:43,980 --> 02:23:45,980
1, 2, 3...

2092
02:23:45,980 --> 02:23:48,880
Well, actually I don't think I need it.

2093
02:23:51,140 --> 02:23:52,740
Let's go with gold then.

2094
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:55,080
Hold on.

2095
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:57,620
1, 2, 3...

2096
02:23:57,620 --> 02:23:58,380
5!

2097
02:23:58,600 --> 02:23:59,100
Or 6.

2098
02:24:03,150 --> 02:24:04,030
Ok, after 3.

2099
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:16,720
Oh, it's a heart!

2100
02:24:17,620 --> 02:24:18,420
How cute.

2101
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:22,380
It really is him again!

2102
02:24:24,140 --> 02:24:25,180
Wait, hold on!

2103
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:28,880
Wait!

2104
02:24:28,980 --> 02:24:29,620
Oh my gosh!

2105
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:30,500
Oh my gosh!

2106
02:24:30,680 --> 02:24:32,360
Wait, how do I...

2107
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:38,760
At least when I fought him as Dante it was like in a separate room, you know?

2108
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:40,880
So, it felt a little different.

2109
02:24:41,260 --> 02:24:42,360
It felt...

2110
02:24:43,380 --> 02:24:45,080
Stop stunlocking me please.

2111
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:52,460
I've never seen that!

2112
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:53,080
That's crazy!

2113
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:00,820
That was so awesome!

2114
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:08,240
Oh.

2115
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:09,140
Yeah,

2116
02:25:16,730 --> 02:25:17,070
stupid.

2117
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:27,600
Oh, damn!

2118
02:25:39,010 --> 02:25:39,810
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2119
02:25:40,710 --> 02:25:41,990
Oh, ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2120
02:25:42,130 --> 02:25:42,810
I couldn't move.

2121
02:25:42,950 --> 02:25:43,650
I was stunlocked.

2122
02:25:44,210 --> 02:25:44,510
No!

2123
02:25:54,530 --> 02:25:56,090
I'm just sitting here.

2124
02:25:59,100 --> 02:25:59,700
Wait, ah!

2125
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:02,460
I should've... I should've grabbed him!

2126
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:03,280
I'm such an idiot!

2127
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:04,700
I didn't think about it.

2128
02:26:05,220 --> 02:26:06,140
I should've grabbed him!

2129
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:07,760
Oh, oh, ow!

2130
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:11,960
You son of a gun!

2131
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:13,200
You!

2132
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:16,640
I hate you!

2133
02:26:16,760 --> 02:26:17,740
I hate you!

2134
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:22,740
Dummy.

2135
02:26:22,740 --> 02:26:24,260
Stupid, stupid, stupid head.

2136
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:26,000
Stupid, stupid, stupid head.

2137
02:26:26,380 --> 02:26:27,780
Stupid, stupid, stupid head!

2138
02:26:31,560 --> 02:26:32,880
I'll just eat the damage.

2139
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:33,520
Eat the damage!

2140
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:37,300
Oh, oh, wait.

2141
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:38,640
I do want to get out of this way, though.

2142
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:46,600
Ah, bees, please!

2143
02:26:51,530 --> 02:26:52,270
Wait, grab him!

2144
02:27:12,370 --> 02:27:13,310
Just a little bit more.

2145
02:27:13,650 --> 02:27:14,250
Just a little bit more!

2146
02:27:17,810 --> 02:27:18,610
Just a little bit more!

2147
02:27:20,830 --> 02:27:21,770
Don't get stunlocked, Nero.

2148
02:27:29,320 --> 02:27:29,840
Oh, god.

2149
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:30,900
I don't want him to grab me.

2150
02:27:34,960 --> 02:27:35,900
Oh my god, he's so close.

2151
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:37,580
Oh, he's dead.

2152
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:41,560
I thought he had one HP and a dream.

2153
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:51,260
OK!

2154
02:27:56,780 --> 02:27:58,340
No dream for this guy.

2155
02:27:59,060 --> 02:28:00,740
Wait, can I get more health?

2156
02:28:01,060 --> 02:28:03,180
Can I roll the dice one more time?

2157
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:06,700
Can I get...

2158
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:14,960
Here we go!

2159
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:22,280
Oh, the mission's done.

2160
02:28:22,540 --> 02:28:22,860
Yay!

2161
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:25,200
My gambling addiction.

2162
02:28:25,780 --> 02:28:27,060
I was pretty good at it, though.

2163
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:29,340
The casinos hate her.

2164
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:40,080
Yeah, Dante, I had to clean up your mess.

2165
02:28:40,740 --> 02:28:41,100
Again!

2166
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:42,640
Well, he had to clean up mine.

2167
02:28:46,120 --> 02:28:47,560
I'm going through it.

2168
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:48,180
What are you talking about?

2169
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:48,940
You're going...

2170
02:29:13,730 --> 02:29:14,650
Triple A!

2171
02:29:21,370 --> 02:29:22,290
Wowie, guys.

2172
02:29:22,450 --> 02:29:24,070
Are we really on the last mission?

2173
02:29:45,810 --> 02:29:48,190
We made it through the boss rush!

2174
02:29:50,630 --> 02:29:52,010
Yay for us, everybody.

2175
02:29:52,130 --> 02:29:52,750
Yay for us.

2176
02:29:52,830 --> 02:29:54,950
I have to use the little ghosties room real quick.

2177
02:29:54,950 --> 02:29:57,930
Wow, maybe... Well, I don't want to jinx myself.

2178
02:29:58,030 --> 02:30:02,310
I was going to say, maybe we'll finish the stream way sooner than I expected, but...

2179
02:30:02,310 --> 02:30:03,270
I don't want to jinx myself.

2180
02:30:03,730 --> 02:30:05,930
What if it takes me five hours to find the final boss?

2181
02:30:08,710 --> 02:30:09,390
What if?

2182
02:30:13,730 --> 02:30:17,030
I think compared to DMC3 boss rush, this one wasn't as bad.

2183
02:30:17,810 --> 02:30:19,010
I feel like we... I don't know.

2184
02:30:19,070 --> 02:30:19,950
I feel like we...

2185
02:30:21,070 --> 02:30:21,470
Maybe.

2186
02:30:21,930 --> 02:30:24,290
I think the sexy lady should...

2187
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:26,230
Sorry, I just pulled out my headphones.

2188
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:27,930
I think she's just way too easy.

2189
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:29,030
Koharu!

2190
02:30:30,330 --> 02:30:31,390
I guess she gave me luck.

2191
02:30:43,500 --> 02:30:44,780
DMC3 is harder in general.

2192
02:30:47,180 --> 02:30:48,880
Once you got past the frog, it was easy.

2193
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,020
I don't know why the frog gave me such issues.

2194
02:30:53,220 --> 02:30:55,400
I'm still getting used to Nero, maybe, I guess.

2195
02:30:56,700 --> 02:30:58,420
It's the changing styles that throws you...

2196
02:30:58,420 --> 02:31:01,360
Yeah, yeah, the changing styles that throws you off in this one.

2197
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:06,960
Yeah, because as soon as you're used to Dante, they're like, Hey, wasn't that fun?

2198
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:09,860
Here's Nero for three missions.

2199
02:31:13,480 --> 02:31:16,760
As a heads up, you can counter the boss's charging attack with a grab.

2200
02:31:17,460 --> 02:31:19,180
I will try to remember that, Mr. Orange.

2201
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:20,800
Thank you!

2202
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:24,300
Is there any other tips I should know?

2203
02:31:24,300 --> 02:31:25,840
Is this boss really hard?

2204
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:29,580
Is he like crazy, crazy difficult?

2205
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:36,520
No, no, no, you got this.

2206
02:31:36,860 --> 02:31:38,560
You fought this boss before.

2207
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:41,620
Lamest final boss ever.

2208
02:31:47,930 --> 02:31:49,530
Not long if you live.

2209
02:31:50,430 --> 02:31:52,350
I'm gonna buy some big stars.

2210
02:31:52,650 --> 02:31:53,570
Oh, that's a devil star.

2211
02:31:54,550 --> 02:31:55,890
I'm gonna buy a devil star.

2212
02:31:55,890 --> 02:31:58,010
We'll buy that.

2213
02:31:58,430 --> 02:31:59,310
We'll buy...

2214
02:31:59,310 --> 02:32:00,290
Oh, it's so expensive.

2215
02:32:00,690 --> 02:32:02,730
We can buy an M-star.

2216
02:32:04,890 --> 02:32:07,470
Yeah, the M-stars give us a lot of health.

2217
02:32:08,470 --> 02:32:10,030
Just keep grabbing.

2218
02:32:11,350 --> 02:32:13,390
JKG, just keep grabbing.

2219
02:32:13,830 --> 02:32:14,850
Remember you can bust her.

2220
02:32:15,630 --> 02:32:17,190
I hardly even know her.

2221
02:32:18,290 --> 02:32:21,230
Does holy water work against this guy?

2222
02:32:21,430 --> 02:32:22,830
Because we got two.

2223
02:32:24,110 --> 02:32:25,690
I got two holy waters.

2224
02:32:27,530 --> 02:32:29,610
Save the rorps for DMC5.

2225
02:32:30,430 --> 02:32:32,570
Would they transfer over?

2226
02:32:32,750 --> 02:32:33,450
That would be insane.

2227
02:32:38,770 --> 02:32:39,570
Cheese water.

2228
02:32:41,950 --> 02:32:43,610
If you do it with the shield down...

2229
02:32:43,610 --> 02:32:44,750
Oh, that's right.

2230
02:32:44,910 --> 02:32:46,910
I was like, when did we fight the old man?

2231
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:47,690
Yes!

2232
02:32:49,310 --> 02:32:51,330
Yes, I do remember fighting him.

2233
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:52,490
Yeah, I had to keep grabbing.

2234
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:55,030
If you win, you won't lose.

2235
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:56,410
True, true, true.

2236
02:32:56,570 --> 02:32:58,250
I've seen people struggle with this boss.

2237
02:32:58,830 --> 02:32:59,790
Okay, okay, okay.

2238
02:33:00,290 --> 02:33:02,090
He can block holy water.

2239
02:33:02,890 --> 02:33:04,250
That's cheating, Sanctus.

2240
02:33:07,070 --> 02:33:09,030
Yeah, we punched him in the face.

2241
02:33:13,210 --> 02:33:14,670
I remember, I remember, I remember.

2242
02:33:15,210 --> 02:33:16,410
DT grabbed to beat him.

2243
02:33:16,790 --> 02:33:16,950
Okay.

2244
02:33:17,970 --> 02:33:21,070
So I should maybe buy another double star.

2245
02:33:21,730 --> 02:33:23,330
Double star, double star.

2246
02:33:23,330 --> 02:33:26,330
And we got two S stars.

2247
02:33:26,750 --> 02:33:28,470
I think we might be good.

2248
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:29,970
I'm gonna buy an L star.

2249
02:33:30,390 --> 02:33:31,730
J, just in case.

2250
02:33:32,050 --> 02:33:32,670
J-I-C.

2251
02:33:33,470 --> 02:33:34,650
I have no small stars.

2252
02:33:34,770 --> 02:33:35,790
I have four...

2253
02:33:35,790 --> 02:33:37,210
I think we're gonna be good.

2254
02:33:39,110 --> 02:33:40,110
W star.

2255
02:33:41,150 --> 02:33:42,310
Save the rorps for 5.

2256
02:33:42,350 --> 02:33:44,170
Wait, actually, I'm confused.

2257
02:33:45,470 --> 02:33:49,770
Is this... I can't tell if you guys are pulling my leg.

2258
02:33:51,650 --> 02:33:53,170
They don't transfer.

2259
02:33:53,290 --> 02:33:54,690
Oh, you guys!

2260
02:33:56,010 --> 02:33:58,710
Next you're gonna say gullibles written on the ceiling.

2261
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:16,420
W star, W star, W...

2262
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:20,240
I guess we'll just buy more double stars, maybe.

2263
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:25,740
Just keep double star, just keep double star.

2264
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:28,740
And health star.

2265
02:34:28,740 --> 02:34:30,560
Oh, I can't... Oh, health star.

2266
02:34:31,660 --> 02:34:32,900
Health star.

2267
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:35,420
Health...

2268
02:34:35,420 --> 02:34:37,600
I have three of them.

2269
02:34:38,180 --> 02:34:38,800
Three.

2270
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:44,740
Okay, before we go though, I'm gonna use the little ghost's room, so...

2271
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:48,320
I'll let you listen.

2272
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:51,440
And now...

2273
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:52,640
We'll be back.

2274
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:12,960
Wait, I forgot to take my throat medicine.

2275
02:35:21,260 --> 02:35:22,860
It's so powdery.

2276
02:35:34,300 --> 02:35:35,260
We were premature.

2277
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:39,140
Itadakimasu!

2278
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:15,360
Donkey, donkey.

2279
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:17,580
I forgot to get my...

2280
02:38:18,280 --> 02:38:21,860
I forgot to get my cup so I can get some more tea.

2281
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:23,480
Tadaima!

2282
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:27,180
Okaeri.

2283
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:27,780
Tadaima.

2284
02:38:28,900 --> 02:38:31,120
You can't tell me tadaima.

2285
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:33,500
Okaeri, I tell you okaeri.

2286
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:35,920
I tell you.

2287
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:38,860
Are we ready for it?

2288
02:38:39,380 --> 02:38:45,540
You guys, I feel like I got a little stinkus prematurely for that boss rush.

2289
02:38:45,620 --> 02:38:49,740
I think I was thinking of how much I suffered in three.

2290
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:54,080
How much it angered me to my soul, which is all I am.

2291
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:59,180
But, I got prematurely upset.

2292
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:02,500
It wasn't even that bad.

2293
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:05,820
Biggest stinkus.

2294
02:39:07,580 --> 02:39:10,400
Sorry, understandable.

2295
02:39:13,180 --> 02:39:15,440
Little stinkus, butaro stream.

2296
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:19,940
No, he's biggest stinkus.

2297
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:21,500
Okay.

2298
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:25,300
Destroy the evil stinkus!

2299
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:26,540
Let's go.

2300
02:39:29,560 --> 02:39:31,180
DMC3 was the training arc.

2301
02:39:31,300 --> 02:39:31,700
Truly.

2302
02:39:33,260 --> 02:39:33,840
Truly.

2303
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:39,200
But to be fair, I did just fight them as Dante.

2304
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:42,280
Kirie!

2305
02:39:55,820 --> 02:39:58,300
Oh, golly!

2306
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:16,480
How does anyone see this and not think it's demonic?

2307
02:40:19,860 --> 02:40:22,100
She's like, he's protecting me.

2308
02:40:22,420 --> 02:40:23,040
I like that.

2309
02:40:25,300 --> 02:40:26,580
Damn her hips!

2310
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,800
She got that hourglass figure.

2311
02:40:40,360 --> 02:40:41,760
Google it.

2312
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:45,120
Sorry, I was too distracted by her hips.

2313
02:40:52,770 --> 02:40:54,910
Word of God, it's Dante.

2314
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:08,910
Oh my god!

2315
02:41:11,690 --> 02:41:12,250
Wait, hold on.

2316
02:41:12,450 --> 02:41:12,670
Sorry.

2317
02:41:15,010 --> 02:41:15,730
Thank you, biggest!

2318
02:41:16,550 --> 02:41:18,170
Yeah, I'm looking forward to DMC5.

2319
02:41:18,270 --> 02:41:19,370
Sorry, I wanted to turn it down.

2320
02:41:19,370 --> 02:41:19,690
Okay.

2321
02:41:21,830 --> 02:41:22,510
Oh, wait.

2322
02:41:22,690 --> 02:41:22,930
Sorry.

2323
02:41:23,290 --> 02:41:23,490
Wait.

2324
02:41:23,730 --> 02:41:24,210
Oh my gosh.

2325
02:41:25,390 --> 02:41:25,870
Wait!

2326
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,080
Ouch!

2327
02:41:36,400 --> 02:41:37,540
Okay, okay, hold on.

2328
02:41:38,120 --> 02:41:40,740
Oh, don't parry me.

2329
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:41,780
Don't do that.

2330
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:43,060
Don't do that.

2331
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:44,440
Don't do that.

2332
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:45,660
Don't do that.

2333
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:48,240
Oh,

2334
02:42:02,720 --> 02:42:03,120
he's down.

2335
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:09,200
Oh my gosh.

2336
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:13,020
I need to stop walking on while I'm like that.

2337
02:42:13,740 --> 02:42:15,000
I need to stop doing what I'm doing.

2338
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:16,280
Oh my goodness.

2339
02:42:16,500 --> 02:42:18,220
I didn't realize what he was doing.

2340
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:27,040
Where are you?

2341
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:31,370
I don't remember this fight very much.

2342
02:42:31,490 --> 02:42:31,890
You know what?

2343
02:42:33,930 --> 02:42:34,790
What am I doing?

2344
02:42:41,440 --> 02:42:41,880
Ouch!

2345
02:42:55,250 --> 02:42:55,690
Ouch!

2346
02:42:56,830 --> 02:42:57,570
Stop, please.

2347
02:42:57,770 --> 02:42:58,070
Please.

2348
02:43:00,230 --> 02:43:00,710
Ouch!

2349
02:43:00,910 --> 02:43:01,710
Please, stop it.

2350
02:43:02,130 --> 02:43:02,630
Oh, please.

2351
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:03,650
Please, grandpa.

2352
02:43:04,970 --> 02:43:06,930
Oh my god, I run into it every time.

2353
02:43:07,370 --> 02:43:08,710
I literally run into it every time.

2354
02:43:09,550 --> 02:43:10,370
Oh my god.

2355
02:43:11,290 --> 02:43:12,070
I suck.

2356
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:22,560
Please!

2357
02:43:22,980 --> 02:43:23,240
Please!

2358
02:43:23,700 --> 02:43:24,340
I'm trying!

2359
02:43:24,500 --> 02:43:24,920
I'm grabbing!

2360
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:29,100
Wait.

2361
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:29,820
Please.

2362
02:43:32,180 --> 02:43:32,920
Oh my god.

2363
02:43:34,700 --> 02:43:35,300
Please.

2364
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:35,920
Oh my god.

2365
02:43:36,020 --> 02:43:38,440
I'm so freaking bad at this.

2366
02:43:41,860 --> 02:43:43,180
I'm so bad at this.

2367
02:43:43,240 --> 02:43:43,460
Sorry.

2368
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:46,900
God!

2369
02:44:09,700 --> 02:44:11,520
I'm literally... I am...

2370
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:13,160
Oh, OK.

2371
02:44:13,360 --> 02:44:13,560
Wait.

2372
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:15,720
I don't...

2373
02:44:15,720 --> 02:44:19,640
I wasted my last one.

2374
02:44:19,780 --> 02:44:20,460
That was unfortunate.

2375
02:44:20,900 --> 02:44:21,380
But this one.

2376
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:22,480
I will not waste.

2377
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:28,740
Yeah, I know I need to stun him first.

2378
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:30,780
That's what I've been trying to do.

2379
02:44:32,620 --> 02:44:34,620
I'm not just running around for nothing.

2380
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:38,520
Oh, he's gotta get his little...

2381
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:47,400
What if I... Also, holy water.

2382
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:53,840
And then what if I... Devil storm.

2383
02:44:55,440 --> 02:44:58,140
OK, and then... Oh, and then... Ah!

2384
02:44:58,480 --> 02:44:58,860
Grab him.

2385
02:44:58,960 --> 02:44:59,200
Grab him.

2386
02:44:59,260 --> 02:44:59,540
There we go.

2387
02:45:04,140 --> 02:45:05,140
Item maxing?

2388
02:45:05,220 --> 02:45:05,780
Yeah, absolutely.

2389
02:45:15,860 --> 02:45:17,100
What is this?

2390
02:45:19,820 --> 02:45:20,600
Well, I didn't know...

2391
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:22,880
OK.

2392
02:45:23,560 --> 02:45:24,000
OK.

2393
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:24,540
OK.

2394
02:45:24,540 --> 02:45:24,660
OK.

2395
02:45:24,800 --> 02:45:24,800
OK.

2396
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:25,700
That's enough.

2397
02:45:25,900 --> 02:45:26,400
That's enough.

2398
02:45:28,040 --> 02:45:28,360
Yes.

2399
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:56,860
What?

2400
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:02,900
I should have just... I should have just busted it.

2401
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:04,180
It's fine.

2402
02:46:08,220 --> 02:46:09,060
It's OK.

2403
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:13,440
He doesn't deserve.

2404
02:46:13,620 --> 02:46:14,340
He doesn't deserve.

2405
02:46:15,820 --> 02:46:17,180
He doesn't deserve it.

2406
02:46:19,780 --> 02:46:20,980
You missed the jackpot.

2407
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:21,500
It's OK.

2408
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:27,200
I'm gonna grab you.

2409
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:29,440
I'm gonna grab you away from there.

2410
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:29,780
Ah!

2411
02:46:29,960 --> 02:46:30,760
I really am!

2412
02:46:33,420 --> 02:46:33,940
Yeah!

2413
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:35,880
Go Nero, go!

2414
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:41,320
Important thing is you won.

2415
02:46:41,420 --> 02:46:42,380
I really just...

2416
02:46:44,180 --> 02:46:48,240
Cheese is not the right word, but I paid to win for that fight.

2417
02:46:51,380 --> 02:46:54,480
Use all that you've learned in the game.

2418
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:57,420
All that I've learned is to collect robes.

2419
02:47:00,060 --> 02:47:00,740
Yeah!

2420
02:47:00,860 --> 02:47:02,080
We saved that girl!

2421
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:09,840
Kyrie, wake up.

2422
02:47:10,820 --> 02:47:13,400
Only true love's kiss will wake her up.

2423
02:47:17,250 --> 02:47:18,910
My girlfriend mom?

2424
02:47:19,490 --> 02:47:23,990
What are you

2425
02:47:28,430 --> 02:47:29,170
doing Dante?

2426
02:47:35,570 --> 02:47:36,730
Also sister.

2427
02:47:37,030 --> 02:47:37,950
Girlfriend sister.

2428
02:47:39,430 --> 02:47:40,630
Nero gets the maiden.

2429
02:47:40,750 --> 02:47:42,150
He is no longer a maiden then.

2430
02:47:46,280 --> 02:47:50,420
I'm not gonna lie, this would be a sick monument to keep in town though.

2431
02:48:18,970 --> 02:48:21,650
Thanks for sending me money, Damald.

2432
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:41,200
Grandpa!

2433
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:51,760
Wait, actually...

2434
02:48:54,460 --> 02:48:55,240
Go finish it.

2435
02:48:55,280 --> 02:48:56,080
Wait, what am I gonna do?

2436
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:03,360
She's like, I'll think about it.

2437
02:49:11,590 --> 02:49:12,270
Guys, it's fine.

2438
02:49:12,310 --> 02:49:13,190
Don't give it any attention.

2439
02:49:14,310 --> 02:49:16,050
I can't tell if it's serious or not.

2440
02:49:25,850 --> 02:49:26,950
That was so abrupt.

2441
02:49:34,740 --> 02:49:35,720
I can't move.

2442
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:36,060
Hello?

2443
02:49:43,660 --> 02:49:44,460
Wait, actually...

2444
02:49:48,800 --> 02:49:50,340
How am I supposed to...

2445
02:49:51,900 --> 02:49:53,240
I'm supposed to do that, right?

2446
02:49:53,360 --> 02:49:54,880
OK, I guess I gotta time it well.

2447
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:57,820
What if I...and...

2448
02:49:57,820 --> 02:49:59,040
Oh, I didn't time it again.

2449
02:50:03,820 --> 02:50:04,220
And...

2450
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:09,680
You

2451
02:50:17,380 --> 02:50:17,600
know what?

2452
02:50:17,620 --> 02:50:19,000
Maybe the super chatter is right.

2453
02:50:31,950 --> 02:50:33,090
He's so weak.

2454
02:50:57,320 --> 02:51:01,220
This is what I know some of you wish you could do to your Oshiers.

2455
02:51:04,700 --> 02:51:05,180
High

2456
02:51:23,540 --> 02:51:23,980
five.

2457
02:51:24,300 --> 02:51:24,840
High touch.

2458
02:51:25,580 --> 02:51:27,160
Nero going full wrestler with the claw.

2459
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:33,180
I'm so cool.

2460
02:51:33,320 --> 02:51:34,240
Nailed it.

2461
02:51:35,930 --> 02:51:37,280
Ultimate head pat.

2462
02:51:38,500 --> 02:51:40,520
That's the lobotomy head pat.

2463
02:51:44,760 --> 02:51:47,800
What if you die there?

2464
02:51:48,040 --> 02:51:48,640
What happens?

2465
02:51:54,860 --> 02:51:56,220
Strong, great.

2466
02:52:02,080 --> 02:52:02,540
Wait.

2467
02:52:07,620 --> 02:52:09,460
You forgot this.

2468
02:52:09,900 --> 02:52:12,320
He's giving it back to us.

2469
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:16,120
Our brother, who is dead?

2470
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:20,240
So melodramatic.

2471
02:52:20,380 --> 02:52:20,660
Dante.

2472
02:52:24,540 --> 02:52:25,800
What's he doing?

2473
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:32,100
I'm taller than him.

2474
02:52:37,380 --> 02:52:38,060
No.

2475
02:52:46,830 --> 02:52:48,070
Uncle Dante.

2476
02:52:56,270 --> 02:52:57,650
Is this the end?

2477
02:52:59,690 --> 02:53:00,030
Maybe.

2478
02:53:04,590 --> 02:53:05,270
Uncle?

2479
02:53:06,370 --> 02:53:09,350
I don't...well...he's not...I don't know if he's papa.

2480
02:53:09,950 --> 02:53:11,990
I just...you know, like how you call like a...

2481
02:53:14,530 --> 02:53:14,590
Yeah.

2482
02:53:16,890 --> 02:53:17,950
For now.

2483
02:53:21,490 --> 02:53:22,190
Kyrie.

2484
02:53:37,530 --> 02:53:39,370
She's accepting him.

2485
02:53:44,050 --> 02:53:45,510
He kept it.

2486
02:53:45,590 --> 02:53:45,950
Yeah.

2487
02:53:46,490 --> 02:53:47,950
Her necklace.

2488
02:53:51,250 --> 02:53:53,130
The BGM is so sweet.

2489
02:53:59,630 --> 02:54:00,430
Oh,

2490
02:54:05,610 --> 02:54:07,490
they're watching the show, eh?

2491
02:54:11,490 --> 02:54:12,750
Little perv.

2492
02:54:16,230 --> 02:54:16,970
Oh wait.

2493
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:21,280
Thanks.

2494
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:23,980
Don't wipe your mouth, you freak.

2495
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:30,480
Oh, are you okay?

2496
02:54:31,300 --> 02:54:31,840
Oh my god.

2497
02:54:35,240 --> 02:54:36,940
I wish I could double trigger.

2498
02:54:41,230 --> 02:54:43,290
Wait, is this the thing where I have to defeat them?

2499
02:54:43,430 --> 02:54:44,590
Look at her just standing there.

2500
02:54:45,270 --> 02:54:46,930
They're totally just leaving her alone.

2501
02:54:49,710 --> 02:54:51,790
Oh wait, not you over there.

2502
02:54:54,130 --> 02:54:55,090
Protect her.

2503
02:54:55,870 --> 02:54:57,370
They're not going after her.

2504
02:54:57,750 --> 02:54:58,730
They don't care about her.

2505
02:54:59,330 --> 02:55:00,070
Maybe they do.

2506
02:55:00,310 --> 02:55:02,090
Wait, what are you doing looking at my girl for?

2507
02:55:10,380 --> 02:55:11,340
Oh wait.

2508
02:55:11,700 --> 02:55:13,360
Hey, you're getting awfully close to my girl.

2509
02:55:24,800 --> 02:55:26,120
Stay away from her.

2510
02:55:27,460 --> 02:55:28,800
Wait, I'm trying to...there we go.

2511
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:32,420
Watch out, KDA.

2512
02:55:32,740 --> 02:55:34,600
Maybe move away a little bit.

2513
02:55:34,680 --> 02:55:35,020
Oh my god.

2514
02:55:35,740 --> 02:55:36,600
Oh my god.

2515
02:55:37,220 --> 02:55:38,120
Wait, KDA.

2516
02:55:38,660 --> 02:55:39,140
KDA.

2517
02:55:39,660 --> 02:55:40,420
I think I'm stupid.

2518
02:55:43,020 --> 02:55:43,580
Wait.

2519
02:55:43,580 --> 02:55:45,260
Wait, I'm trying to...

2520
02:55:47,740 --> 02:55:48,300
KDA.

2521
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:53,520
It happened off screen, so I totally protected her.

2522
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:04,760
They were like, just roll the credits.

2523
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:08,800
Wait, do I not get the kiss?

2524
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:14,180
Can I redo it?

2525
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:16,240
Give me another chance, KDA.

2526
02:56:17,180 --> 02:56:19,240
KDA, give me another...

2527
02:56:29,290 --> 02:56:31,230
I don't know why I didn't grab him.

2528
02:56:31,290 --> 02:56:33,530
Sorry, I was back in Dante mode.

2529
02:56:34,430 --> 02:56:35,390
Doomed romance.

2530
02:56:35,490 --> 02:56:36,770
Wait a second, it's not doomed.

2531
02:56:38,030 --> 02:56:39,410
See, I totally finished.

2532
02:56:40,410 --> 02:56:42,130
The time has come and so have I.

2533
02:56:46,670 --> 02:56:47,670
Bad end where?

2534
02:56:47,670 --> 02:56:47,810
Where?

2535
02:56:54,450 --> 02:56:56,230
Walk over to her.

2536
02:56:58,210 --> 02:57:01,850
Why are you staring at her from so far away, you freak?

2537
02:57:03,230 --> 02:57:04,890
Why are you being such a creep?

2538
02:57:05,990 --> 02:57:09,170
Nero, I can't...can I move?

2539
02:57:10,810 --> 02:57:13,130
Why are we just standing there?

2540
02:57:14,790 --> 02:57:16,250
Social distance.

2541
02:57:16,330 --> 02:57:17,630
Oh, a reflection.

2542
02:57:25,050 --> 02:57:27,190
Us in the pool.

2543
02:57:29,050 --> 02:57:31,810
This is so NGS2.

2544
02:57:32,890 --> 02:57:36,690
Feels like when Raiden is back with Rose.

2545
02:57:38,050 --> 02:57:39,490
Is she pregnant?

2546
02:57:48,930 --> 02:57:50,790
You did just let her get hit by a demon.

2547
02:57:50,990 --> 02:57:51,990
She's probably a bit mad at you.

2548
02:57:52,710 --> 02:57:53,110
No!

2549
02:57:58,590 --> 02:58:00,370
This is so beautiful.

2550
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:02,970
Well done, Minto.

2551
02:58:03,230 --> 02:58:04,150
Thank you!

2552
02:58:04,490 --> 02:58:05,250
Right stick should mute.

2553
02:58:05,590 --> 02:58:06,290
Oh, you're right.

2554
02:58:06,370 --> 02:58:08,070
I can move it just a little tiny bit.

2555
02:58:08,170 --> 02:58:08,650
Thank you.

2556
02:58:14,270 --> 02:58:14,810
Earthquake!

2557
02:58:15,210 --> 02:58:17,270
Get down!

2558
02:58:19,770 --> 02:58:20,790
Trigger for zoom.

2559
02:58:26,240 --> 02:58:27,440
Oh, the jiggle physics.

2560
02:58:35,880 --> 02:58:36,300
Oh, sorry.

2561
02:58:36,800 --> 02:58:38,220
I didn't actually mean to do it that time.

2562
02:58:42,240 --> 02:58:43,320
That schnoz.

2563
02:58:50,860 --> 02:58:52,060
Oh, they are waffling.

2564
02:58:53,460 --> 02:58:54,800
He's so shy!

2565
02:59:01,740 --> 02:59:04,020
She likes his demon hand.

2566
02:59:08,560 --> 02:59:09,680
Hand holding.

2567
02:59:13,580 --> 02:59:15,240
Villain, thank you for the ping!

2568
02:59:35,990 --> 02:59:37,170
Add the spoof.

2569
02:59:43,260 --> 02:59:45,800
I don't know what the achievement I got though.

2570
02:59:45,940 --> 02:59:47,580
Probably just beating the...

2571
02:59:47,580 --> 02:59:48,900
The music is so pretty!

2572
02:59:49,640 --> 02:59:50,360
Yay!

2573
02:59:55,370 --> 02:59:56,610
Love your playthrough.

2574
02:59:56,810 --> 02:59:57,770
Thank you!

2575
02:59:58,750 --> 02:59:59,410
Thank you, thank you.

2576
02:59:59,490 --> 03:00:01,230
Sorry, no secret cutscene.

2577
03:00:02,070 --> 03:00:02,890
Sorry, sorry.

2578
03:00:04,290 --> 03:00:05,450
Sorry, sorry.

2579
03:00:06,550 --> 03:00:08,310
Wanna watch the secret ending on YouTube?

2580
03:00:08,910 --> 03:00:13,250
Yeah, I do!

2581
03:00:15,950 --> 03:00:18,490
Guess you are some casual gamer.

2582
03:00:28,760 --> 03:00:29,280
RachelGaming!

2583
03:00:30,980 --> 03:00:33,000
Thank you guys for the superchats.

2584
03:00:33,580 --> 03:00:34,500
Thank you.

2585
03:00:34,880 --> 03:00:36,960
Congrats on saving girlfriend, mommy, sister.

2586
03:00:38,980 --> 03:00:40,860
You conquered four DMC games.

2587
03:00:40,940 --> 03:00:41,660
I'm proud of you.

2588
03:00:41,740 --> 03:00:42,480
Thank you!

2589
03:00:44,840 --> 03:00:46,640
This game was so silly.

2590
03:00:46,960 --> 03:00:49,320
This game is definitely my favorite out of the four so far.

2591
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:55,780
Everybody says five is even better so I'm excited to play it.

2592
03:00:57,560 --> 03:00:59,000
Logan, thanks for the 10 gifted!

2593
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:01,320
Thank you.

2594
03:01:01,420 --> 03:01:02,320
Next game is Peak.

2595
03:01:06,700 --> 03:01:11,020
Wow, I thought it was going to be 6-7 hours.

2596
03:01:11,200 --> 03:01:12,180
It's only 3 hours.

2597
03:01:12,220 --> 03:01:14,180
I cheesed the final boss.

2598
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:21,080
I cheesed it.

2599
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:25,260
You did not cheese.

2600
03:01:25,320 --> 03:01:25,820
I didn't?

2601
03:01:26,620 --> 03:01:29,240
I should have busted at the end though.

2602
03:01:32,440 --> 03:01:39,740
Gallery, Son of Sparta, Bloody Palace, Game Clear Bonus, History of DMC?

2603
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:41,540
That's so exciting.

2604
03:01:41,820 --> 03:01:42,220
Hold on.

2605
03:01:45,560 --> 03:01:46,600
Give me the gallery.

2606
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:51,400
The day, Dante.

2607
03:01:54,160 --> 03:02:01,280
The proprietor of Devil May Cry received a request from the beautiful Trish was truly a red-letter day.

2608
03:02:01,940 --> 03:02:08,580
For it was the day that he was asked to travel to Mallet Island and combat the demon emperor Mundus.

2609
03:02:12,150 --> 03:02:22,070
Just as his father, the legendary Dark Knight Sparta did ages before, Dante was tasked with stealing away Mundus.

2610
03:02:24,930 --> 03:02:29,030
Mundus responded to this challenge like any evil puppet master.

2611
03:02:29,550 --> 03:02:33,490
He sent his subordinates to exterminate Dante's family.

2612
03:02:36,790 --> 03:02:45,610
Empowered with demonic abilities thanks to the blood of Sparta coursing through his veins, Dante set off to perform the emperor's last rites.

2613
03:02:48,330 --> 03:02:56,890
After eliminating the demon sent to end his existence, Dante's journey took him to the immense castle said to hold the slumbering Mundus.

2614
03:02:57,430 --> 03:02:59,410
Wow, they're just really going through all of Devil May Cry.

2615
03:02:59,910 --> 03:03:00,590
The first one.

2616
03:03:00,590 --> 03:03:08,630
It was there that he met a demon named Nihiloangelo, the transformed soul of his departed brother Virgil.

2617
03:03:11,470 --> 03:03:21,230
Armed with the power inherited from his father and filled with regret over his brother's fate, Dante faced off in a final battle against Mundus.

2618
03:03:22,230 --> 03:03:22,830
Why?

2619
03:03:23,770 --> 03:03:28,190
Dante, a renowned devil hunter and born to a human mother in legendary Dark Knight Sparta.

2620
03:03:28,190 --> 03:03:31,990
Dante is the proprietor of Devil May Cry, a shop specializing in the elimination of demon kind.

2621
03:03:32,330 --> 03:03:38,070
There are some who say Dante, with his two pistols in his hand and a sword slung across his back, has even surpassed his father's power.

2622
03:03:40,030 --> 03:03:41,970
Trish, the mysterious beauty.

2623
03:03:42,310 --> 03:03:46,630
Trish was responsible for requesting Dante steal away the demon emperor Mundus.

2624
03:03:46,950 --> 03:03:51,750
Closely resembling Dante's departed mother, Trish is actually a demon crafted in that form by Mundus himself.

2625
03:03:51,750 --> 03:03:57,410
However, in the face of Dante's love, her human heart awoke, and now she works along with the devil hunter as his partner.

2626
03:04:01,690 --> 03:04:07,910
Nihiloangelo, the demonic knight who battled Dante on three occasions, surprisingly avoided his dirty tricks and improvised methods for which denizens of the underworld are so often known for.

2627
03:04:08,270 --> 03:04:13,110
At the root of Nihiloangelo's chivalry lies his origins, for within the demon's body rests the soul of Virgil and...

2628
03:04:16,440 --> 03:04:17,240
Mucho texto.

2629
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:19,240
And skip.

2630
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:20,220
Okay, anyway.

2631
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:27,290
I thought it was gonna be not a history of the games.

2632
03:04:27,430 --> 03:04:29,870
I thought it was gonna be like a...

2633
03:04:31,970 --> 03:04:32,970
Like a...

2634
03:04:32,970 --> 03:04:36,070
Like a, oh this is how DMC got started.

2635
03:04:37,610 --> 03:04:38,150
You know.

2636
03:04:39,210 --> 03:04:40,710
This is so good.

2637
03:04:41,310 --> 03:04:42,410
Wait, can I move the camera?

2638
03:04:43,410 --> 03:04:44,190
Oh, there we go.

2639
03:04:45,290 --> 03:04:47,630
This side is so hot.

2640
03:04:47,770 --> 03:04:48,850
Oh my god.

2641
03:04:54,010 --> 03:04:55,450
Big ol' Angus beef.

2642
03:04:55,510 --> 03:04:55,950
Hold on.

2643
03:05:06,320 --> 03:05:08,580
Oh wow, it looks like I have four arms.

2644
03:05:14,980 --> 03:05:16,180
Wait, how does the song go?

2645
03:05:17,560 --> 03:05:18,220
Hold on.

2646
03:05:18,920 --> 03:05:19,900
What's the song called?

2647
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:20,660
Out of Darkness?

2648
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:25,460
Devil May Cry.

2649
03:05:37,980 --> 03:05:45,280
A voice calling you, calling you out of darkness.

2650
03:05:46,280 --> 03:05:51,440
Hear the devil's cry of sin.

2651
03:05:52,080 --> 03:05:58,820
Oh, always turn your back on him.

2652
03:05:59,700 --> 03:06:04,080
With the wind you go.

2653
03:06:04,080 --> 03:06:11,740
Still I dream of your spirit leading you back home.

2654
03:06:12,220 --> 03:06:17,580
I will give my gifts to you.

2655
03:06:18,180 --> 03:06:23,100
Grow your garden, wash it blue.

2656
03:06:35,020 --> 03:06:36,340
Is there no audio?

2657
03:06:38,300 --> 03:06:39,800
Character images.

2658
03:06:39,800 --> 03:06:40,000
Characters.

2659
03:06:43,920 --> 03:06:45,040
Wait, that's it.

2660
03:06:45,180 --> 03:06:46,160
I can't even zoom in.

2661
03:06:46,380 --> 03:06:47,020
I can't do anything.

2662
03:06:51,400 --> 03:06:52,900
Oh sorry, I'm in the way.

2663
03:06:53,280 --> 03:06:54,480
Wait, I'm right next to...

2664
03:06:54,480 --> 03:06:55,760
I'm in the game!

2665
03:06:57,600 --> 03:06:59,460
Check out the virtual cutscene if you can.

2666
03:06:59,520 --> 03:06:59,920
It's cool.

2667
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:02,680
Prototype Nero.

2668
03:07:04,320 --> 03:07:05,520
EX color Nero.

2669
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:06,740
I like the blue.

2670
03:07:07,100 --> 03:07:07,900
I like the blue.

2671
03:07:09,800 --> 03:07:10,920
Nero in DT.

2672
03:07:11,020 --> 03:07:12,000
Look at his eyeballs.

2673
03:07:13,020 --> 03:07:15,420
Red Queen, Blue Rose, QDA.

2674
03:07:20,010 --> 03:07:21,910
Wait, I gotta be taller than that.

2675
03:07:25,810 --> 03:07:27,630
My sister wife?

2676
03:07:33,250 --> 03:07:33,970
Credo!

2677
03:07:34,650 --> 03:07:35,670
Credit card!

2678
03:07:37,190 --> 03:07:42,410
I don't think...I wouldn't have remembered his name if it wasn't written.

2679
03:07:44,390 --> 03:07:45,850
He's so close to me.

2680
03:07:49,620 --> 03:07:54,380
I think Angus might be my...I can't even say his name right.

2681
03:07:54,460 --> 03:07:56,100
Angus might be my favorite character.

2682
03:08:02,370 --> 03:08:04,490
How tall is Dante canonically?

2683
03:08:11,060 --> 03:08:12,840
Angus beef, Angus beef.

2684
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:20,320
I love the face mask.

2685
03:08:21,940 --> 03:08:23,840
This is so lame.

2686
03:08:25,020 --> 03:08:26,380
Taller than you.

2687
03:08:27,540 --> 03:08:30,160
Oh my god the rose!

2688
03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:32,620
The rose in his mouth.

2689
03:08:32,820 --> 03:08:33,720
6'3"?

2690
03:08:33,720 --> 03:08:35,200
6'4"?

2691
03:08:35,200 --> 03:08:36,480
I think he's pretty tall.

2692
03:08:37,660 --> 03:08:37,960
What?

2693
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:40,780
Wait, so then I would be like...

2694
03:08:42,160 --> 03:08:43,120
No way!

2695
03:08:47,230 --> 03:08:48,590
Does this look right?

2696
03:08:49,050 --> 03:08:50,070
Oh my god!

2697
03:08:52,150 --> 03:08:54,010
In the end we are all satisfied.

2698
03:09:00,550 --> 03:09:02,270
Yes, I take your hand.

2699
03:09:04,430 --> 03:09:05,830
This...no, I have to be taller.

2700
03:09:06,370 --> 03:09:07,390
This doesn't seem right.

2701
03:09:08,370 --> 03:09:09,610
This doesn't seem right.

2702
03:09:09,710 --> 03:09:10,790
This seems messed up.

2703
03:09:12,690 --> 03:09:13,770
The teeth!

2704
03:09:13,890 --> 03:09:15,370
Wow, wait that's insane.

2705
03:09:15,370 --> 03:09:16,570
This looks so cool.

2706
03:09:16,710 --> 03:09:18,230
Sorry, I'll get out of the way now.

2707
03:09:19,530 --> 03:09:21,490
Wow, Devil Trigger Sparta.

2708
03:09:22,090 --> 03:09:26,370
Wait, so if I'm in this outfit and I Devil Trigger, that's what it looks like?

2709
03:09:28,050 --> 03:09:28,650
What?

2710
03:09:30,690 --> 03:09:31,290
Sorry.

2711
03:09:32,490 --> 03:09:33,270
Oh my god.

2712
03:09:47,360 --> 03:09:48,560
Dante small.

2713
03:09:49,780 --> 03:09:51,060
Dante in DT.

2714
03:09:51,860 --> 03:09:52,940
Sorry, I have no words.

2715
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:53,480
I can't say it.

2716
03:09:53,520 --> 03:09:54,920
If I speak, I am in trouble.

2717
03:10:09,280 --> 03:10:09,680
Lady.

2718
03:10:11,860 --> 03:10:13,140
I wish we saw more lady.

2719
03:10:13,260 --> 03:10:15,000
I know you can play as lady in Trish, no?

2720
03:10:16,760 --> 03:10:17,160
God.

2721
03:10:18,420 --> 03:10:18,820
Trish!

2722
03:10:20,220 --> 03:10:20,620
Gloria!

2723
03:10:22,100 --> 03:10:23,680
She's not wearing panties.

2724
03:10:23,940 --> 03:10:24,800
You don't see them.

2725
03:10:24,980 --> 03:10:28,220
Unless it's like the most high-waisted...

2726
03:10:29,140 --> 03:10:30,880
Like they have to go up to here.

2727
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:35,640
You can what?

2728
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:38,600
They are so cute.

2729
03:10:41,680 --> 03:10:42,940
Bianco Angelo.

2730
03:10:43,660 --> 03:10:44,340
It's a sticker?

2731
03:10:44,840 --> 03:10:45,920
Look up the cutscenes.

2732
03:10:46,180 --> 03:10:47,100
She wears a sticker.

2733
03:10:50,540 --> 03:10:51,180
Nice.

2734
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:54,460
Frost, Assault, Blitz.

2735
03:10:55,720 --> 03:10:56,960
Wait, where is this guy?

2736
03:10:58,220 --> 03:11:00,640
The bane of my existence.

2737
03:11:00,920 --> 03:11:01,540
Burial.

2738
03:11:02,180 --> 03:11:03,140
Echidna.

2739
03:11:03,920 --> 03:11:04,940
So sexy.

2740
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:08,160
Wait, we didn't get all the boss images.

2741
03:11:08,360 --> 03:11:08,760
That's weird.

2742
03:11:14,080 --> 03:11:16,540
I thought we would see more Blitzes.

2743
03:11:16,660 --> 03:11:18,660
Thank goodness we didn't.

2744
03:11:20,020 --> 03:11:23,020
Thank goodness we didn't.

2745
03:11:23,500 --> 03:11:25,840
Thank goodness we didn't.

2746
03:11:26,860 --> 03:11:28,880
Thank goodness we didn't.

2747
03:11:29,880 --> 03:11:30,440
Thank...

2748
03:11:30,440 --> 03:11:35,020
I love this.

2749
03:11:35,780 --> 03:11:36,900
Mega Scarecrow.

2750
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:38,080
Gosh, they look so cool.

2751
03:11:38,460 --> 03:11:39,960
I love the Scarecrow designs.

2752
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:41,420
They are so, so cool.

2753
03:11:42,300 --> 03:11:45,280
Actually, all the enemies in this game look really awesome.

2754
03:11:46,380 --> 03:11:48,340
All the enemies are just very cool.

2755
03:11:49,500 --> 03:11:50,300
On higher difficulty.

2756
03:11:52,600 --> 03:11:53,160
Glorious.

2757
03:11:53,160 --> 03:11:53,360
Glorious.

2758
03:11:53,680 --> 03:11:55,280
Oh, these are the ones that go under, no?

2759
03:11:55,580 --> 03:11:56,660
No, that's the Cutlass.

2760
03:11:57,340 --> 03:11:57,740
Glorious.

2761
03:11:57,940 --> 03:12:00,180
Oh, those are the ones that are flying around and you have to shoot them.

2762
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:01,800
You can play as Lady and Trish.

2763
03:12:04,160 --> 03:12:06,020
I can't even see it.

2764
03:12:07,860 --> 03:12:09,780
They did Basilisk so dirty.

2765
03:12:11,600 --> 03:12:13,460
Oh wait, are those his eyes?

2766
03:12:13,640 --> 03:12:14,220
I can't tell.

2767
03:12:16,200 --> 03:12:18,340
Oh, I was like, what the hell is that?

2768
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:19,400
Yes.

2769
03:12:22,180 --> 03:12:28,560
It looks so awesome when he infects the Scarecrow.

2770
03:12:29,260 --> 03:12:30,760
You don't really get a good look at it.

2771
03:12:30,840 --> 03:12:33,340
Oh my gosh, it kind of reminds me of...

2772
03:12:34,120 --> 03:12:34,820
What's it called?

2773
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:38,060
If you go back to the bonus art gallery you'll find nice art of all the ladies.

2774
03:12:38,860 --> 03:12:39,100
What?

2775
03:12:39,440 --> 03:12:40,000
Did I miss it?

2776
03:12:41,640 --> 03:12:45,500
It looks like Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean.

2777
03:12:45,900 --> 03:12:47,100
You can inspect the model.

2778
03:12:47,180 --> 03:12:48,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just going through the...

2779
03:12:48,680 --> 03:12:50,280
I just want to see the...

2780
03:12:52,300 --> 03:12:52,700
models.

2781
03:12:54,100 --> 03:12:54,500
Faust.

2782
03:12:57,040 --> 03:12:57,840
Alto Angelo.

2783
03:12:59,700 --> 03:13:00,100
Fault.

2784
03:13:00,740 --> 03:13:01,880
Oh, that's all it showed me.

2785
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:03,240
No Blitz?

2786
03:13:06,380 --> 03:13:09,140
Oh, maybe I can turn them if I inspect them, let's see.

2787
03:13:12,660 --> 03:13:13,880
Oh, I can just zoom.

2788
03:13:14,080 --> 03:13:14,400
Oh, wait.

2789
03:13:21,560 --> 03:13:25,000
Oh my god, he's so cool.

2790
03:13:27,840 --> 03:13:29,020
He's so cool.

2791
03:13:31,700 --> 03:13:34,700
Ok, so wait, where am I going to see all the lovely ladies?

2792
03:13:38,120 --> 03:13:39,000
To gallery?

2793
03:13:40,060 --> 03:13:40,580
Bonus?

2794
03:13:41,060 --> 03:13:43,200
I don't think I got another bonus though.

2795
03:13:43,280 --> 03:13:44,700
Yeah, I only have one out of one.

2796
03:13:45,540 --> 03:13:47,140
I only have one out of one.

2797
03:13:48,800 --> 03:13:49,940
Congrats on beating DMC4.

2798
03:13:50,100 --> 03:13:52,460
Folks want some kind of DMC slice of life?

2799
03:13:52,540 --> 03:13:56,720
There's a 2007 DMC anime where Dante eats ice cream.

2800
03:13:57,440 --> 03:13:59,280
And where lady met Trish.

2801
03:14:02,480 --> 03:14:03,980
Look at those hips swaying.

2802
03:14:04,560 --> 03:14:07,820
Yeah, I don't think I have it unlocked.

2803
03:14:07,900 --> 03:14:08,980
Maybe I have to...

2804
03:14:10,920 --> 03:14:11,640
Is that the main menu?

2805
03:14:13,740 --> 03:14:14,160
Alrighty!

2806
03:14:15,060 --> 03:14:15,540
Thank you!

2807
03:14:16,080 --> 03:14:16,960
Congrats on beating the game.

2808
03:14:17,040 --> 03:14:17,520
Good job Mito!

2809
03:14:17,800 --> 03:14:18,700
Also Nekomimi.

2810
03:14:20,480 --> 03:14:21,320
Thank you!

2811
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:25,600
Capcom is successful because it takes feedback from its players.

2812
03:14:26,820 --> 03:14:29,940
So the issues you have definitely got back to the dev teams for five.

2813
03:14:30,380 --> 03:14:30,700
Really?

2814
03:14:31,440 --> 03:14:33,200
So they're changing the game as we speak?

2815
03:14:38,240 --> 03:14:39,740
That's so cute!

2816
03:14:42,460 --> 03:14:45,100
That's so cute that it updated.

2817
03:14:50,890 --> 03:14:51,790
Store?

2818
03:15:02,350 --> 03:15:03,270
My game froze?

2819
03:15:06,510 --> 03:15:07,970
My game froze.

2820
03:15:14,760 --> 03:15:17,000
It's opening Steam store?

2821
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:18,380
Oh, but it didn't.

2822
03:15:18,780 --> 03:15:19,660
My game just froze.

2823
03:15:22,220 --> 03:15:25,600
Wait, you can actually buy... Like Steam store.

2824
03:15:26,520 --> 03:15:28,460
Like you can... What do you buy?

2825
03:15:30,080 --> 03:15:32,020
It's opening Steam somewhere.

2826
03:15:32,980 --> 03:15:33,460
It's not.

2827
03:15:35,660 --> 03:15:36,100
DLC?

2828
03:15:36,300 --> 03:15:37,540
Wait, like better weapons?

2829
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:38,140
What do you get?

2830
03:15:38,780 --> 03:15:41,780
There are other intro cutscenes if you want to check out the other characters.

2831
03:15:41,900 --> 03:15:42,500
Yeah, yeah.

2832
03:15:42,600 --> 03:15:43,960
Well, if my game didn't freeze.

2833
03:15:43,960 --> 03:15:45,200
No way!

2834
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:50,720
You can buy...

2835
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:55,820
You can spend real money to buy...

2836
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:06,420
No way!

2837
03:16:06,780 --> 03:16:08,120
Then I have to close out the game.

2838
03:16:09,520 --> 03:16:10,800
And the game won't close.

2839
03:16:11,400 --> 03:16:14,880
You can buy...

2840
03:16:14,880 --> 03:16:16,640
No way!

2841
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:19,620
DLC!

2842
03:16:20,140 --> 03:16:21,720
Oh my gosh, wait, how much is it?

2843
03:16:23,220 --> 03:16:24,840
I can... Wait, what is this?

2844
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:26,580
View page.

2845
03:16:26,680 --> 03:16:27,280
Ok, hold on.

2846
03:16:28,440 --> 03:16:29,380
Downloadable content.

2847
03:16:29,540 --> 03:16:31,640
Buy S Nero Dante Virgil.

2848
03:16:32,880 --> 03:16:35,260
I can buy Smol Dante.

2849
03:16:36,400 --> 03:16:39,560
I can buy Lady in Trish Costumes.

2850
03:16:40,540 --> 03:16:41,220
Proud Souls!

2851
03:16:41,660 --> 03:16:43,940
20,000 Proud Souls!

2852
03:16:47,160 --> 03:16:50,100
And... Wait, sorry, sorry, I said 20,000.

2853
03:16:50,640 --> 03:16:53,080
200,000 Proud Souls!

2854
03:16:54,100 --> 03:16:54,940
200,000!

2855
03:16:55,840 --> 03:17:00,180
And then you can buy 300,000 Red Orbs!

2856
03:17:09,840 --> 03:17:12,360
I thought I... Does anyone actually buy these?

2857
03:17:12,400 --> 03:17:13,180
Wait, do they have reviews?

2858
03:17:14,960 --> 03:17:15,520
Positive.

2859
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:16,940
What are the reviews?

2860
03:17:16,940 --> 03:17:20,600
The first one is just... Motivated.

2861
03:17:22,820 --> 03:17:23,260
Recommended.

2862
03:17:23,260 --> 03:17:24,140
Recommended, thank you.

2863
03:17:24,240 --> 03:17:26,660
Now I'm going to buy tons of Blue Orbs.

2864
03:17:27,240 --> 03:17:28,920
One person said not recommended.

2865
03:17:29,140 --> 03:17:31,020
It won't let me buy the Red Orbs.

2866
03:17:31,500 --> 03:17:35,280
I don't have the DLC in my library, but it keeps saying I already have it in my library.

2867
03:17:36,880 --> 03:17:37,320
Recommended.

2868
03:17:37,420 --> 03:17:39,380
Can I buy 300,000 Orbs again?

2869
03:17:39,960 --> 03:17:41,000
Recommended, 10 out of 10.

2870
03:17:41,100 --> 03:17:41,940
Recommended, yes.

2871
03:17:41,940 --> 03:17:45,280
Recommended, make the game less grindy-ey DLC.

2872
03:17:52,550 --> 03:17:54,090
This is too much.

2873
03:17:55,510 --> 03:17:56,610
Play the game!

2874
03:17:57,710 --> 03:18:00,750
What do you mean?

2875
03:18:03,030 --> 03:18:04,370
I'm opening it back up.

2876
03:18:04,450 --> 03:18:06,010
We'll watch the other cutscenes.

2877
03:18:06,210 --> 03:18:08,690
I do want to see how Lady and Trish...

2878
03:18:09,470 --> 03:18:11,070
play, because I think that's really exciting.

2879
03:18:12,190 --> 03:18:12,970
There it goes.

2880
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:20,920
That's too much.

2881
03:18:20,940 --> 03:18:23,040
Oh no, we lost her...

2882
03:18:23,040 --> 03:18:24,700
We lost her home screen.

2883
03:18:25,140 --> 03:18:27,180
Let us know if you watch the DMC Madhouse anime.

2884
03:18:27,360 --> 03:18:28,400
It's connected to DMC5.

2885
03:18:28,480 --> 03:18:31,080
I'm going to watch all the anime after I finish the game.

2886
03:18:33,980 --> 03:18:35,020
Devil May Cry.

2887
03:18:36,820 --> 03:18:37,900
OK, let's see.

2888
03:18:40,020 --> 03:18:42,040
Devil Hunter 1.

2889
03:18:43,680 --> 03:18:44,180
Wait.

2890
03:18:44,520 --> 03:18:45,080
Oh, wait.

2891
03:18:45,400 --> 03:18:46,340
Oh, there we go.

2892
03:18:46,340 --> 03:18:48,840
Virgil looks so cool.

2893
03:18:56,120 --> 03:18:57,860
Lady and Trish.

2894
03:19:00,400 --> 03:19:02,420
I'm just going to go on human mode.

2895
03:19:04,060 --> 03:19:06,160
The girls are so hot.

2896
03:19:06,240 --> 03:19:07,060
They really are.

2897
03:19:11,920 --> 03:19:13,300
I want pizza.

2898
03:19:19,500 --> 03:19:20,760
I want pizza.

2899
03:19:24,520 --> 03:19:27,540
I'm going to be honest.

2900
03:19:29,240 --> 03:19:31,920
Trish reminds... Lady I'm in love with.

2901
03:19:32,460 --> 03:19:34,300
Lady is absolutely my type.

2902
03:19:34,380 --> 03:19:34,960
She's so hot.

2903
03:19:38,020 --> 03:19:38,660
Trish...

2904
03:19:43,500 --> 03:19:46,440
Trish looks like the female version of Ocelot.

2905
03:19:48,300 --> 03:19:51,040
Like the official version.

2906
03:19:53,640 --> 03:19:55,940
We never got to see her do that.

2907
03:19:56,640 --> 03:19:57,600
This is so fun.

2908
03:20:04,040 --> 03:20:05,760
Thanks can't unsee.

2909
03:20:11,360 --> 03:20:13,000
See you there.

2910
03:20:13,980 --> 03:20:15,660
Hot stuff.

2911
03:20:16,600 --> 03:20:19,400
Oh my god, the jiggle physics are great.

2912
03:20:20,560 --> 03:20:22,860
They're just subtle enough that it makes me excited.

2913
03:20:30,790 --> 03:20:32,250
Trish looks better in 5.

2914
03:20:32,810 --> 03:20:33,350
I don't know.

2915
03:20:33,410 --> 03:20:34,970
Lady is really hard for me to beat.

2916
03:20:39,240 --> 03:20:41,020
She's entirely my type.

2917
03:20:46,920 --> 03:20:48,080
Are they?

2918
03:20:50,890 --> 03:20:51,730
Are they?

2919
03:21:19,750 --> 03:21:21,550
That was too close.

2920
03:21:22,950 --> 03:21:25,870
Now, will I replay the game as the other characters?

2921
03:21:29,130 --> 03:21:31,950
If I do any of them, I might do Virgil.

2922
03:21:32,230 --> 03:21:34,250
Because that's the most interesting for me.

2923
03:21:34,330 --> 03:21:35,790
Because I'm like, why are you even here?

2924
03:21:37,430 --> 03:21:39,590
And it probably would be...

2925
03:21:40,170 --> 03:21:41,030
Like, the members.

2926
03:21:42,510 --> 03:21:43,010
I don't know.

2927
03:21:43,130 --> 03:21:44,430
Oh no, they took all the pizza!

2928
03:21:45,230 --> 03:21:46,410
God, I want pizza.

2929
03:21:47,230 --> 03:21:48,930
It's early enough, I can still get pizza.

2930
03:21:50,450 --> 03:21:51,570
Virgil is so OP.

2931
03:21:51,990 --> 03:21:53,350
You try Virgil, he's busted.

2932
03:21:54,070 --> 03:21:55,790
I mean...

2933
03:21:57,090 --> 03:21:58,510
I'm so close!

2934
03:22:09,060 --> 03:22:10,220
Busted you say?

2935
03:22:13,340 --> 03:22:15,280
Gosh, they really know what the people want.

2936
03:22:18,100 --> 03:22:19,300
It's about as big as your head.

2937
03:22:19,400 --> 03:22:19,820
I'm bigger.

2938
03:22:20,880 --> 03:22:24,200
Oh, your character will move in the direction you press...

2939
03:22:24,200 --> 03:22:24,980
Wait, we're fighting.

2940
03:22:28,060 --> 03:22:29,080
We're fighting, Dante.

2941
03:22:37,040 --> 03:22:38,420
Oh, attack with your... OK.

2942
03:22:41,500 --> 03:22:41,960
OK.

2943
03:22:43,260 --> 03:22:44,060
I did it.

2944
03:22:44,920 --> 03:22:45,380
Jump.

2945
03:22:45,480 --> 03:22:46,100
OK, I did it.

2946
03:22:46,200 --> 03:22:46,460
Jump.

2947
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:47,420
Oh wait.

2948
03:22:48,140 --> 03:22:48,540
Jump.

2949
03:22:51,100 --> 03:22:51,720
Do it again.

2950
03:22:56,660 --> 03:22:57,720
OK, I did it.

2951
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:01,400
How do I switch?

2952
03:23:02,200 --> 03:23:02,680
Oh, jump.

2953
03:23:05,960 --> 03:23:06,780
Oh wow.

2954
03:23:07,420 --> 03:23:08,060
OK.

2955
03:23:08,800 --> 03:23:09,600
Side roll.

2956
03:23:31,380 --> 03:23:32,660
Bayonet combo.

2957
03:23:34,040 --> 03:23:34,640
Why?

2958
03:23:34,980 --> 03:23:35,100
Why?

2959
03:23:35,840 --> 03:23:36,440
Why?

2960
03:23:38,540 --> 03:23:39,140
Why?

2961
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:40,100
Why?

2962
03:23:40,360 --> 03:23:40,740
Why?

2963
03:23:41,560 --> 03:23:42,860
Oh, she's slow.

2964
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:46,600
Nice.

2965
03:23:48,300 --> 03:23:48,740
Taunt.

2966
03:23:48,940 --> 03:23:50,120
What does she do when you taunt?

2967
03:23:52,240 --> 03:23:53,380
Oh god, wait.

2968
03:23:54,120 --> 03:23:54,700
Change gun.

2969
03:23:54,780 --> 03:23:55,400
Yeah, I did that.

2970
03:23:55,900 --> 03:23:56,940
Burst attack.

2971
03:23:57,560 --> 03:23:58,980
Help me to throw grenades.

2972
03:23:58,980 --> 03:24:01,300
Let's have at least three levels of Burst Gauge.

2973
03:24:05,680 --> 03:24:06,100
Ow,

2974
03:24:16,200 --> 03:24:17,540
I'm trying to taunt.

2975
03:24:18,240 --> 03:24:19,060
Stop it, Dante.

2976
03:24:21,380 --> 03:24:22,680
Oh, she's like tying her shoe.

2977
03:24:22,760 --> 03:24:23,360
That's so cute.

2978
03:24:30,340 --> 03:24:31,720
Oh, he blocks it.

2979
03:24:31,760 --> 03:24:32,360
That's crazy.

2980
03:24:43,400 --> 03:24:45,540
Oh, she doesn't do like a...

2981
03:24:45,540 --> 03:24:45,980
What's it called?

2982
03:24:46,040 --> 03:24:46,320
Attack?

2983
03:24:48,280 --> 03:24:49,740
I think her stinger is on the shotgun.

2984
03:24:54,460 --> 03:24:57,360
Oh, she does the same...

2985
03:24:59,100 --> 03:25:00,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2986
03:25:00,800 --> 03:25:07,730
Stop deflecting it.

2987
03:25:21,700 --> 03:25:23,420
Come on, Dante.

2988
03:25:25,160 --> 03:25:25,960
Oh, wait.

2989
03:25:28,500 --> 03:25:30,460
Wait, what about Trish though?

2990
03:25:31,740 --> 03:25:33,240
What about Trish though?

2991
03:25:35,140 --> 03:25:36,360
Right in the bongo.

2992
03:25:41,740 --> 03:25:43,020
You killed Dante.

2993
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:45,900
Trish is in Dante's house.

2994
03:25:47,780 --> 03:25:50,640
I see, I see, I see.

2995
03:25:50,720 --> 03:25:51,920
Let's go try Virgil too.

2996
03:25:51,960 --> 03:25:54,540
I'm really curious what the opening cutscene is with him.

2997
03:26:00,420 --> 03:26:02,160
He looks so good.

2998
03:26:08,820 --> 03:26:10,520
Should we watch this?

2999
03:26:10,720 --> 03:26:11,660
I feel like we should, no?

3000
03:26:11,720 --> 03:26:12,580
It's totally different.

3001
03:26:15,100 --> 03:26:15,960
Why are you here?

3002
03:26:16,560 --> 03:26:18,240
To test Trish's new bloody power.

3003
03:26:25,830 --> 03:26:31,430
OK, I thought...I was like wait, is this just the opening video or the intro movie, but it's not.

3004
03:26:32,130 --> 03:26:33,310
Like you know from the main menu.

3005
03:26:33,850 --> 03:26:34,690
That's what I'm talking about.

3006
03:26:38,970 --> 03:26:40,590
This is before DMC3.

3007
03:26:44,270 --> 03:26:46,390
The Order of the Sword, huh?

3008
03:26:49,890 --> 03:26:52,590
Oh, they're building him!

3009
03:26:55,790 --> 03:26:58,590
They worship a demon as a god.

3010
03:27:06,550 --> 03:27:21,550
I can see his pores!

3011
03:27:22,950 --> 03:27:24,250
Virgil, your skin care!

3012
03:27:25,890 --> 03:27:27,710
He looks so young though.

3013
03:27:37,250 --> 03:27:38,270
He's like 16?

3014
03:27:45,130 --> 03:27:46,510
I don't want him to do that.

3015
03:27:53,620 --> 03:27:54,960
More close to 18.

3016
03:27:55,200 --> 03:27:55,900
I see, I see.

3017
03:27:55,900 --> 03:27:57,740
At most like 17.

3018
03:27:58,020 --> 03:27:59,060
I got it, I got it.

3019
03:28:01,740 --> 03:28:02,980
Impeccable impression, Niki.

3020
03:28:03,120 --> 03:28:04,040
Thank you, Brooks!

3021
03:28:12,730 --> 03:28:13,730
The Samurai.

3022
03:28:14,850 --> 03:28:16,070
Pay child support?

3023
03:28:16,410 --> 03:28:17,250
What are you talking about?

3024
03:28:22,170 --> 03:28:23,610
This guy is just a baby.

3025
03:28:23,870 --> 03:28:26,990
Oh, it's his cloak.

3026
03:28:28,410 --> 03:28:28,990
So cool.

3027
03:28:36,540 --> 03:28:38,240
Is this Assassin's Creed cosplay?

3028
03:28:38,580 --> 03:28:38,830
It looks...

3029
03:28:39,620 --> 03:28:41,160
It's just a closet cosplay.

3030
03:28:41,300 --> 03:28:41,770
It looks so...

3031
03:28:42,680 --> 03:28:43,260
Is that a kitty?

3032
03:28:44,920 --> 03:28:45,980
Oh, there's spoilers?

3033
03:28:47,620 --> 03:28:48,040
Wait, what?

3034
03:28:50,920 --> 03:28:51,680
I missed?

3035
03:28:51,900 --> 03:28:52,080
Wait.

3036
03:29:00,520 --> 03:29:01,660
Don't worry about it?

3037
03:29:04,480 --> 03:29:05,480
Don't reach out.

3038
03:29:05,480 --> 03:29:06,300
OK!

3039
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:07,600
OK!

3040
03:29:08,360 --> 03:29:09,960
Okey-dokey.

3041
03:29:10,880 --> 03:29:11,860
What should we buy?

3042
03:29:12,100 --> 03:29:12,600
We can buy...

3043
03:29:12,600 --> 03:29:16,220
Oh my God!

3044
03:29:16,300 --> 03:29:17,840
Wait, he has everything already.

3045
03:29:18,340 --> 03:29:19,240
This is insane.

3046
03:29:22,160 --> 03:29:23,160
Wait!

3047
03:29:33,070 --> 03:29:35,330
This is awkward.

3048
03:29:41,070 --> 03:29:42,590
Oh, don't let him get too close.

3049
03:29:42,690 --> 03:29:42,950
Right.

3050
03:29:46,570 --> 03:29:48,130
He's just saying he's motivated.

3051
03:29:49,170 --> 03:29:49,810
By peepee?

3052
03:29:59,640 --> 03:30:01,100
He still says it.

3053
03:30:02,380 --> 03:30:03,960
Show me your motivation.

3054
03:30:12,370 --> 03:30:13,850
Wait, so is...

3055
03:30:14,390 --> 03:30:15,950
Dante actually the uncle?

3056
03:30:32,100 --> 03:30:34,380
I just said that because it's like...

3057
03:30:34,380 --> 03:30:36,440
Hey, uncle.

3058
03:30:37,960 --> 03:30:38,380
Why?

3059
03:30:41,920 --> 03:30:42,780
Oh, oops.

3060
03:30:43,540 --> 03:30:44,420
Oh, come on.

3061
03:30:44,600 --> 03:30:45,920
You're not supposed to actually do anything.

3062
03:30:49,900 --> 03:30:51,280
You're not supposed to actually do anything.

3063
03:30:52,280 --> 03:30:53,440
I did it, but...

3064
03:30:58,980 --> 03:31:00,100
Why am I so...

3065
03:31:06,440 --> 03:31:07,440
Stop it, Dante.

3066
03:31:13,340 --> 03:31:14,340
Did I get spoiled?

3067
03:31:19,540 --> 03:31:21,420
In Japan, everyone over 30 is an uncle.

3068
03:31:21,500 --> 03:31:22,260
That's what I was like.

3069
03:31:22,300 --> 03:31:23,060
That's why I said uncle.

3070
03:31:23,960 --> 03:31:27,060
I was just like, you know, you call an old guy an uncle.

3071
03:31:27,300 --> 03:31:27,360
No?

3072
03:31:30,120 --> 03:31:30,480
OK.

3073
03:31:34,080 --> 03:31:34,440
Please.

3074
03:31:36,440 --> 03:31:37,240
Upper slash.

3075
03:31:39,060 --> 03:31:39,700
Wait.

3076
03:31:41,400 --> 03:31:42,280
Like that?

3077
03:31:44,060 --> 03:31:45,000
Like that?

3078
03:31:46,240 --> 03:31:49,160
Stop taunting me, you son of a bitch.

3079
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:55,200
Stop!

3080
03:31:57,260 --> 03:31:58,220
Wait, what was it?

3081
03:31:58,460 --> 03:31:59,320
This one's so good.

3082
03:31:59,760 --> 03:32:01,420
He's stealing away my things.

3083
03:32:03,040 --> 03:32:04,540
Stop taunting me.

3084
03:32:06,440 --> 03:32:07,000
Wait, hold on.

3085
03:32:07,080 --> 03:32:08,580
I'm trying to...

3086
03:32:08,580 --> 03:32:09,500
There we go.

3087
03:32:09,700 --> 03:32:09,920
OK.

3088
03:32:12,440 --> 03:32:13,460
Stop it, Dante.

3089
03:32:18,900 --> 03:32:19,800
OK, we did it.

3090
03:32:21,460 --> 03:32:23,360
This is so cute watching them fight.

3091
03:32:25,980 --> 03:32:26,420
Change...Oh.

3092
03:32:27,060 --> 03:32:28,140
I didn't even try to.

3093
03:32:34,900 --> 03:32:36,140
He's got his own singer.

3094
03:32:38,080 --> 03:32:39,580
Wait, this is also familiar.

3095
03:32:42,940 --> 03:32:44,780
Wow, only he can deflect some of them.

3096
03:32:44,940 --> 03:32:46,200
He can't even deflect all of them.

3097
03:32:46,340 --> 03:32:46,800
That's crazy.

3098
03:32:57,360 --> 03:32:58,320
Wait, what other story?

3099
03:32:58,400 --> 03:32:59,040
Oh, what's this?

3100
03:33:01,320 --> 03:33:02,560
Oh, it's Beowulf.

3101
03:33:07,440 --> 03:33:09,660
Oh my gosh, I have to learn literally every...

3102
03:33:11,740 --> 03:33:13,020
Every weapon.

3103
03:33:13,400 --> 03:33:14,860
Oh my gosh, he's already down.

3104
03:33:15,460 --> 03:33:16,900
Oh yeah, DT.

3105
03:33:31,870 --> 03:33:32,630
Fine.

3106
03:33:37,450 --> 03:33:38,870
Virgil is cracked.

3107
03:33:39,630 --> 03:33:41,310
Goodness gracious, this guy.

3108
03:33:41,450 --> 03:33:43,350
It's crazy having every single weapon.

3109
03:33:44,270 --> 03:33:46,370
Like from the get-go.

3110
03:33:48,250 --> 03:33:50,750
He kept Beowulf since last time.

3111
03:33:58,640 --> 03:34:02,680
He just has his whole gameplay kit from DMC3 because it's not a canon game mode.

3112
03:34:04,700 --> 03:34:05,220
Nice.

3113
03:34:10,670 --> 03:34:11,790
Virgil's easy mode.

3114
03:34:12,370 --> 03:34:13,250
Secret ending, yeah.

3115
03:34:13,290 --> 03:34:13,870
Let's watch it.

3116
03:34:14,270 --> 03:34:15,390
Let me pick...Let me pull it up.

3117
03:34:18,570 --> 03:34:19,690
Let me pull it up.

3118
03:34:19,690 --> 03:34:21,150
Let me pull it up.

3119
03:34:21,650 --> 03:34:23,690
Let me pull it up.

3120
03:34:27,730 --> 03:34:31,690
Devil may cry for secret ending.

3121
03:34:32,750 --> 03:34:34,950
Everything that comes up is secret mission.

3122
03:34:35,990 --> 03:34:37,410
No, secret ending.

3123
03:34:39,530 --> 03:34:40,570
No ending...Wait.

3124
03:34:41,910 --> 03:34:44,010
Devil may cry for secret...OK.

3125
03:34:44,390 --> 03:34:46,550
The other one was like 7 and a half minutes long.

3126
03:34:46,610 --> 03:34:47,050
That's crazy.

3127
03:34:47,610 --> 03:34:48,370
OK, hold on.

3128
03:34:48,470 --> 03:34:49,090
Give me a second.

3129
03:34:49,690 --> 03:34:52,170
Let me pull it up for you guys.

3130
03:34:53,370 --> 03:34:55,750
Let me pull it up for you guys.

3131
03:35:19,630 --> 03:35:20,550
Oh, oopsie.

3132
03:35:21,650 --> 03:35:22,130
Hold on.

3133
03:35:27,010 --> 03:35:27,810
Hold on.

3134
03:35:28,450 --> 03:35:30,170
Wait, I almost...OK, let me do this.

3135
03:35:30,770 --> 03:35:31,270
Wait, stop.

3136
03:35:31,650 --> 03:35:32,030
Stop!

3137
03:35:32,310 --> 03:35:32,710
Stop!

3138
03:35:32,870 --> 03:35:33,310
Stop!

3139
03:35:33,610 --> 03:35:34,070
Stop!

3140
03:35:34,310 --> 03:35:35,010
Stop, please!

3141
03:35:35,010 --> 03:35:35,730
Stop!

3142
03:35:36,910 --> 03:35:37,730
Oh, wait.

3143
03:35:37,850 --> 03:35:38,810
Sorry, I forgot to crop it.

3144
03:35:39,030 --> 03:35:39,510
Hold on.

3145
03:35:39,770 --> 03:35:40,010
Ah!

3146
03:35:40,210 --> 03:35:41,130
I'm all over the place.

3147
03:35:41,410 --> 03:35:42,350
Wait, let me crop it.

3148
03:35:42,510 --> 03:35:44,450
OK, so look at my recommended.

3149
03:35:45,910 --> 03:35:48,650
Look at my recommended.

3150
03:35:52,610 --> 03:35:53,650
OK, OK, OK.

3151
03:35:54,530 --> 03:35:55,010
Exposed!

3152
03:35:57,430 --> 03:35:59,370
OK, this is the secret ending.

3153
03:36:00,770 --> 03:36:03,650
Given to us by Raiken Studio.

3154
03:36:03,810 --> 03:36:04,270
Thank you!

3155
03:36:08,150 --> 03:36:09,270
OK, Matarikon.

3156
03:36:09,450 --> 03:36:11,650
I would never watch Matarikon!

3157
03:36:13,910 --> 03:36:14,930
I would never!

3158
03:36:16,450 --> 03:36:18,110
OK, OK.

3159
03:36:18,570 --> 03:36:19,010
We good?

3160
03:36:22,910 --> 03:36:24,230
Is this the right one?

3161
03:36:24,390 --> 03:36:25,910
Let me know if it is or not.

3162
03:36:31,480 --> 03:36:32,240
It is?

3163
03:36:32,340 --> 03:36:34,500
OK, why...this quality.

3164
03:36:36,420 --> 03:36:37,560
Oh, this is the highest quality.

3165
03:36:39,560 --> 03:36:40,420
360p baby.

3166
03:36:40,920 --> 03:36:41,400
Let's go.

3167
03:36:41,400 --> 03:36:42,820
What is he reading?

3168
03:36:51,360 --> 03:36:54,980
Is that Lady in the magazine?

3169
03:36:54,980 --> 03:36:55,040
Really?

3170
03:37:13,340 --> 03:37:16,140
This video is from 16 years ago.

3171
03:37:40,030 --> 03:37:41,270
What should we do?

3172
03:37:50,250 --> 03:37:51,490
It's so loud!

3173
03:38:02,540 --> 03:38:04,680
I can't hear you Dante speak up!

3174
03:38:13,800 --> 03:38:15,660
Are you ready?

3175
03:38:17,120 --> 03:38:18,220
Let's rock!

3176
03:38:18,880 --> 03:38:19,620
Come on!

3177
03:38:23,360 --> 03:38:25,940
Come on babes!

3178
03:38:33,770 --> 03:38:36,110
Oh sorry, I was like what the hell?

3179
03:38:36,370 --> 03:38:38,450
Is this the guy's fucking game?

3180
03:38:40,190 --> 03:38:41,590
I was like wait there is more.

3181
03:38:44,630 --> 03:38:47,670
Is this guy's outro?

3182
03:38:48,460 --> 03:38:51,830
I was like why does it sound like Legend of Zelda?

3183
03:39:04,530 --> 03:39:07,490
I was like oh wow, what's gonna happen next?

3184
03:39:12,580 --> 03:39:14,960
Here, I'll show you guys my actual...here you go.

3185
03:39:15,280 --> 03:39:17,300
You can see my...you can see my...here we go.

3186
03:39:17,640 --> 03:39:18,160
There's me.

3187
03:39:18,960 --> 03:39:20,120
Hold on, hold on.

3188
03:39:20,840 --> 03:39:23,380
Then, there's Metal Gear.

3189
03:39:24,320 --> 03:39:25,800
And then Toho.

3190
03:39:27,800 --> 03:39:29,640
There, I'm exposing myself.

3191
03:39:29,740 --> 03:39:30,860
Someone was like is that Hina?

3192
03:39:31,460 --> 03:39:32,400
Yeah, that's Hina.

3193
03:39:35,880 --> 03:39:37,980
There, because I made the mistake earlier.

3194
03:39:39,740 --> 03:39:41,920
And then there's also Hime Hina.

3195
03:39:48,360 --> 03:39:50,660
To not look at that DMC one.

3196
03:39:53,480 --> 03:39:55,140
This is so fun!

3197
03:39:55,140 --> 03:39:56,200
No way, Metal Gear.

3198
03:39:59,420 --> 03:40:02,000
Zelda's Lullaby was so abrupt.

3199
03:40:03,180 --> 03:40:05,940
I can't believe Dante shot Link from Legend of Zelda.

3200
03:40:06,320 --> 03:40:12,280
It was like he got...he shot the screen and then it was like...

3201
03:40:12,280 --> 03:40:15,020
It was like Link was dying or something.

3202
03:40:16,760 --> 03:40:18,760
Like we were at Link's funeral.

3203
03:40:22,300 --> 03:40:23,700
It was so funny.

3204
03:40:23,700 --> 03:40:23,900
Yeah.

3205
03:40:26,240 --> 03:40:27,780
It was so, so funny.

3206
03:40:29,100 --> 03:40:32,940
Anyway guys, thank you so much for our Devil May Cry 4.

3207
03:40:33,600 --> 03:40:35,820
We'll get to Devil May Cry 5.

3208
03:40:36,500 --> 03:40:40,120
Did I hear someone say it's not as long of a game?

3209
03:40:40,960 --> 03:40:41,440
Or...

3210
03:40:41,440 --> 03:40:44,200
Good job on beating another DMC game.

3211
03:40:44,340 --> 03:40:45,280
Great way to start the weekend.

3212
03:40:45,540 --> 03:40:46,240
Let's rock!

3213
03:40:50,320 --> 03:40:51,840
DMC 5 is still 20 missions.

3214
03:40:51,960 --> 03:40:52,760
Okay, okay, okay.

3215
03:40:55,360 --> 03:40:58,360
I'd rather decide when to do it because...

3216
03:41:00,640 --> 03:41:01,040
My...

3217
03:41:01,040 --> 03:41:02,980
I'm gonna start getting pretty busy here.

3218
03:41:03,980 --> 03:41:06,100
I don't want to put it off for so long.

3219
03:41:06,780 --> 03:41:08,580
Maybe I just get straight into it then.

3220
03:41:09,960 --> 03:41:11,180
How many streams was this?

3221
03:41:11,380 --> 03:41:11,780
5?

3222
03:41:14,760 --> 03:41:16,220
Wait, I did change that, right?

3223
03:41:16,300 --> 03:41:17,140
That is the correct number.

3224
03:41:18,480 --> 03:41:19,940
That is the correct number, right?

3225
03:41:20,100 --> 03:41:20,640
Yeah, yeah.

3226
03:41:20,800 --> 03:41:21,360
So 5...

3227
03:41:23,880 --> 03:41:24,420
1...

3228
03:41:24,420 --> 03:41:25,240
2...

3229
03:41:25,240 --> 03:41:25,700
3...

3230
03:41:26,340 --> 03:41:26,610
4...

3231
03:41:26,880 --> 03:41:28,880
Okay, maybe I will just start it next week then.

3232
03:41:34,040 --> 03:41:36,140
Personally, DMC 5 doesn't feel so long.

3233
03:41:47,760 --> 03:41:48,300
Because...

3234
03:41:48,300 --> 03:41:52,900
Basically, I don't like to start games and then...

3235
03:41:54,340 --> 03:41:58,060
Like, I'll be going to Japan and also going to...

3236
03:41:58,060 --> 03:42:02,320
Like, I have a whole lot of stuff planned in May and June.

3237
03:42:04,220 --> 03:42:04,720
So...

3238
03:42:04,720 --> 03:42:08,540
It might be better if I just start it next week.

3239
03:42:13,560 --> 03:42:15,740
So that I have extra time if...

3240
03:42:15,740 --> 03:42:17,840
You know, some people are saying it might be a little bit more difficult.

3241
03:42:19,380 --> 03:42:21,040
So if I...

3242
03:42:21,040 --> 03:42:22,900
Have extra time...

3243
03:42:22,900 --> 03:42:26,840
To get through it, it might be good.

3244
03:42:28,220 --> 03:42:30,000
Take your time, hope to see you soon in the future.

3245
03:42:38,300 --> 03:42:42,020
If you leave mid-May, you'll have plenty of time.

3246
03:42:43,700 --> 03:42:45,660
It's probably going to take as much time as 4.

3247
03:42:45,780 --> 03:42:47,200
Okay, that's not bad then.

3248
03:42:50,400 --> 03:42:50,760
So...

3249
03:42:52,720 --> 03:42:53,760
Should be okay then.

3250
03:42:55,800 --> 03:42:56,900
Could do two streams a week.

3251
03:42:56,940 --> 03:42:58,520
If it comes to that, I will.

3252
03:42:59,020 --> 03:43:00,020
I think we'll be alright.

3253
03:43:00,700 --> 03:43:01,340
I think so.

3254
03:43:01,980 --> 03:43:03,780
Yeah, I think we'll be okay.

3255
03:43:04,500 --> 03:43:08,480
Yeah, I will be going back to Japan next month.

3256
03:43:10,640 --> 03:43:14,220
Not sure yet if I want to stream while I'm there yet or not.

3257
03:43:14,980 --> 03:43:18,720
It's about a week and a half, I think, that I'll be gone.

3258
03:43:20,300 --> 03:43:21,880
And it's all for work.

3259
03:43:22,240 --> 03:43:22,920
All work.

3260
03:43:23,420 --> 03:43:24,140
All work.

3261
03:43:24,140 --> 03:43:27,560
In fact, there's a lot going on.

3262
03:43:29,420 --> 03:43:32,720
There's a lot going on on that trip.

3263
03:43:36,500 --> 03:43:41,720
For very cool, fun stuff that you'll see in the future.

3264
03:43:45,390 --> 03:43:48,810
While I'm waiting for you, I guess, I'll go check JPEGDAWG.

3265
03:44:00,700 --> 03:44:01,900
What could be happening?

3266
03:44:08,520 --> 03:44:11,820
Like I said, I might bring my set up so I can stream.

3267
03:44:11,960 --> 03:44:13,800
Even just a couple times while I'm over there.

3268
03:44:14,860 --> 03:44:19,660
Since it's less for play, I'll be in the worker's mindset already.

3269
03:44:19,920 --> 03:44:22,720
I'll be in the content mindset.

3270
03:44:22,720 --> 03:44:31,100
And since my last trip to Japan was way more for vacation...

3271
03:44:32,820 --> 03:44:34,120
Tiny monitor time.

3272
03:44:40,560 --> 03:44:41,260
We'll see.

3273
03:44:41,660 --> 03:44:42,840
Perfect for DMC.

3274
03:44:45,480 --> 03:44:47,780
Anyway, this is so much fun.

3275
03:44:47,880 --> 03:44:50,080
I'm actually so hungry, so I'm gonna go eat.

3276
03:44:50,580 --> 03:44:51,540
Maybe I'll go get some pizza.

3277
03:44:53,640 --> 03:44:55,600
Thank you guys for DMC4!

3278
03:44:57,100 --> 03:44:57,720
Thank you!

3279
03:44:58,260 --> 03:44:59,060
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3280
03:44:59,100 --> 03:45:00,360
This is so much fun!

3281
03:45:00,820 --> 03:45:05,260
And I will see you guys probably next week for DMC5!

3282
03:45:08,640 --> 03:45:12,300
No more pizza, but I didn't get to eat my last pizza.

3283
03:45:12,960 --> 03:45:14,240
Well, I ate a couple bites.

3284
03:45:14,780 --> 03:45:15,980
It's too difficult to eat.

3285
03:45:15,980 --> 03:45:18,380
Otsubito!

3286
03:45:18,680 --> 03:45:19,600
Itterasshai!

3287
03:45:20,380 --> 03:45:21,140
Thank you everyone!

3288
03:45:21,780 --> 03:45:22,380
Byebye!
