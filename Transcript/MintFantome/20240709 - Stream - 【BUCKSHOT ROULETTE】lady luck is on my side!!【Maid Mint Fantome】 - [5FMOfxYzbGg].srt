1
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,620
Guys...

2
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,260
Guys, I'm so frustrated today.

3
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,640
For reasons I cannot say.

4
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,520
What if I just take...

5
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,260
No, I was gonna make a really bad joke.

6
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,220
I was gonna make a really bad joke.

7
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,340
It's not even a joke.

8
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,020
Oh gosh.

9
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,040
I just got back from Anime Expo!

10
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,600
Boy, are my arms tired.

11
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,900
Boy, are my arms tired.

12
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,740
From all the lifting I had to do.

13
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:04,880
From all the lifting I had to do.

14
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,960
Lifting your...

15
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,500
Lifting all your tears.

16
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,000
She hates us!

17
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,080
Did you dodge the cotton flu?

18
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,680
I think so.

19
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,200
I think I'm good.

20
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:21,520
I think I'm good.

21
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,060
I don't feel sick.

22
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,500
I just feel...

23
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,440
I don't feel sick.

24
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,860
I feel...

25
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,880
I love backshot roulette.

26
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:35,820
Yeah.

27
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,360
I've never played this before.

28
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,300
But I've seen...

29
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,580
I've seen...

30
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,940
Lots of people play.

31
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,180
But I've never played it.

32
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,380
So I'm excited to give it a shot.

33
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,820
So I'm excited to give it a shot.

34
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,220
Haha, get it?

35
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,260
A shot.

36
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,320
Minto?

37
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,300
Wait, what?

38
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,920
I'm ready for rat jams and gamba.

39
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,340
I'm ready for rat jams and gamba.

40
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,680
I'm ready for rat jams and gamba.

41
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,160
I got the five gifted!

42
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,640
Take up thanks for the...

43
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,880
Thanks for the five gifted and ghost of mint!

44
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
Thank you for the Okasupa!

45
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,780
My voice echoing?

46
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,400
Is my voice echoing?

47
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,220
I think you have the window open two times.

48
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,340
Thanks for the five gifted!

49
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,680
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

50
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,260
Thank you!

51
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,280
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

52
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,160
Truly a doggy dog world.

53
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,080
You echo in my kokoro.

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,360
I think you might have heart disease.

55
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,660
If you have mint in your heart.

56
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,840
Or...

57
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,200
You have like a hole in your lungs.

58
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,880
And when you eat mint, it goes to your heart.

59
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,420
Not lungs.

60
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,040
Your...

61
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,480
Shoot, it's been a long time since I've been human.

62
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,420
Food doesn't go to your lungs, I think.

63
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,820
Your...

64
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,700
Your...

65
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,760
Your...

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
Trachea?

67
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,340
I don't remember.

68
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,540
What's the pipe that goes to your stomach?

69
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,980
Esophagus?

70
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,700
The food pipe.

71
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,380
What do those look like outside of the body?

72
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,920
Wait, there's a trachea then.

73
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,680
Actually...

74
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,280
Tell me where dad went today.

75
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,660
Sommi!

76
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,540
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

77
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,460
Thank you so much!

78
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm usually a lurker but I went to super chat for the first time on my birthday!

79
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,280
Oh my gosh, can I just call you Ace, since I'm not sure how to say your old name?

80
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,480
Thank you so much!

81
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,640
Happy birthday!

82
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,700
Happy birthday to you!

83
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,060
Happy birthday to you!

84
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,880
Happy birthday dear Ace...

85
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,780
3jerodin.

86
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,720
Happy birthday to you!

87
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,060
Happy birthday!

88
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,160
So I'm catching up.

89
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,000
Give our thanks to the 10 gifted!

90
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

91
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,060
In regards to no spoiler rules on MGS streams, does that apply to comments?

92
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:09,880
No.

93
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,760
I think you're good.

94
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,060
I think it's just on stream.

95
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,340
Do you guys ever look through comments?

96
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,580
On streams and stuff?

97
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,980
Like after you...

98
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,940
After...

99
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,920
If you're watching Avad, do you look through the comments too?

100
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,840
Sometimes, yes?

101
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,040
You do?

102
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,980
I can't read.

103
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:35,940
Relatable?

104
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,480
Relatable, relatable, relatable, relatable.

105
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,880
Kiss your after thanks to the 5 gifted!

106
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,560
Ducky thanks for the 5 gifted!

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,080
Serval thanks for the 5 gifted!

108
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,960
Ashen thanks for the 10 gifted!

109
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,840
Thank you, thank you, thank you guys.

110
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,440
Have a ton of fun on virtual vacation.

111
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,060
Yeah!

112
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,780
Oh my gosh.

113
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,900
If you went, you had fun.

114
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,880
It was so much fun for me.

115
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,840
Even though I was sent to the back rooms.

116
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,540
The back... the back...

117
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,640
The back shot!

118
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,070
To the 5 gifted!

119
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,150
The...

120
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,250
The backstage...

121
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,230
Back rooms.

122
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,010
Where we played the...

123
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,610
The back shot roulette.

124
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,650
Katsu thanks for the 10 gifted!

125
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,750
Del thanks for the 10 gifted!

126
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,530
It was fun.

127
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,210
Mint, no!

128
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,990
I'm going to shoot your oshi.

129
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,510
Why are you guys blushing?

130
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,630
Virtual vacation was the most fun I've ever had at a concert.

131
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,850
Please do it again next AX.

132
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,230
Well, it's not really up to me, but...

133
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,210
Maybe I could be a guest at AX one day.

134
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,050
Heard you were going to be at Otakutan!

135
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,110
Yeah!

136
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,110
Oh, I need to add that to my...

137
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,130
To my menu of...

138
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,270
That's not what back shot me.

139
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,090
That's the name of the game.

140
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,470
Oh, back shot.

141
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,370
Oh, wait!

142
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,670
Oh, oh!

143
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,610
I got it mixed up!

144
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,090
Guys, I think...

145
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,050
Guys, I got back shot and the buck shot mixed up.

146
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,770
I'm so sorry.

147
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,920
Oh, wait, hold on.

148
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,840
Let me do this one instead.

149
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,820
Let me do it.

150
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,620
Let me do this one.

151
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,180
I'm so sorry!

152
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,680
Because...

153
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,920
They're very...

154
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,540
What?

155
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,250
I got the...

156
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,090
I got the back...

157
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,130
I got them mixed up.

158
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,470
Everybody kept saying back shot for so long that I just...

159
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,210
I just...

160
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,890
It just became the name of the game for me.

161
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,290
It was your guys in the comments.

162
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,070
In the chat.

163
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,310
That made me confused.

164
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,330
In fact...

165
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,030
In fact, I even...

166
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,690
I almost put this as the...

167
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,990
As the thumbnail.

168
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,390
But...

169
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,990
It's the wrong one.

170
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,210
It almost lined up.

171
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,170
It shows up first on Google Images!

172
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,550
It does!

173
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,490
It actually does!

174
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,130
I looked up...

175
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,990
I looked up back...

176
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,450
Bucks...

177
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,990
Back shot roulette...

178
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,090
Roulette logo.

179
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,510
And it was the first thing that came up.

180
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,530
And now...

181
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,510
I'm very confused.

182
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,650
Not confused.

183
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,650
My brain is all mixed up.

184
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,090
I'm not taking the blame for this one.

185
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,410
I'm not...

186
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,150
I don't...

187
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,530
You're done...

188
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,330
I'm not... I'm not taking the blame for this one.

189
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,610
You can't... Don't blame... You can't blame me!

190
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,850
You can't blame me!

191
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,590
I almost made... I didn't even realize though!

192
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,110
Gaslighting right at the beginning...

193
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,070
Alright.

194
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,330
Anyway, I don't know anything about this game.

195
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,630
I don't know much of anything.

196
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,390
So I'm excited to see what happens.

197
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,630
And... Hold on.

198
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,050
You are tired.

199
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,550
It's okay.

200
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,430
Thank you.

201
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,290
You don't even know its name!

202
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,290
I can't... Just a Freudian slip.

203
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,730
But it's also just so close to the original name.

204
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,570
What is a buckshot anyway?

205
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,950
Pretty sure I've seen fan art of Mint playing buckshot roulette anyway.

206
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:27,830
I don't know anything about this game.

207
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,450
A shotgun shell.

208
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,510
Oh, okay.

209
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,900
Stop...

210
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
What's happening?

211
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,780
Why are you guys always telling... Why are you guys always telling me to stop?

212
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,840
Stop reading every comment out loud.

213
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,060
What did you do?

214
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,540
What did I say wrong?

215
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:49,980
WRONG!

216
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,200
You should be on this raft.

217
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,400
It's true.

218
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,300
Don't stop.

219
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,460
I'm not reading... I'm not reading that comment.

220
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,580
I'm pressing X to doubt.

221
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,190
If you want... If you want... If you want a different type of game...

222
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,770
You can... I don't think YouTube is the place for you.

223
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,110
Or Minto Channel.

224
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,910
Six bullets.

225
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,250
More than enough to...

226
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,030
Backshot!

227
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:31,850
Stop!

228
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,180
Let's restart the stream at this point.

229
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,120
Oh, it's already starting so terribly!

230
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,760
Thank you for the 10 gifted!

231
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
You guys, let's just play the game.

232
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,800
I don't even know how to play.

233
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,660
My last super chat did not say buckshot.

234
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,580
Which one?

235
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,700
Oh my god, YouTube.

236
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,960
Now I'm getting confused.

237
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,760
You guys keep saying one word or the other.

238
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,060
I'm gonna have to ban them both at this rate.

239
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,400
I'm gonna have to ban both words.

240
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,340
So I'll never get confused again.

241
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,380
It's a bad... It's a... It's a...

242
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,060
It's a... It's a word...

243
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,480
It's a cancelled word on my stream.

244
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,360
Now, both of them.

245
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,000
The BA and the BU.

246
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,480
Monopoly Archive.

247
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,940
Anyway.

248
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,440
Yeah.

249
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,740
Buck.

250
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,300
Shot.

251
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,640
Roulette.

252
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,040
Today.

253
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,180
Star.

254
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,140
How's the audio, by the way?

255
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,440
I thought it was kind of loud earlier.

256
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,180
Oh.

257
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,560
It's dark.

258
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,940
I'm afraid.

259
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,500
I'm at the club!

260
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,040
Oh my god!

261
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,360
Ah!

262
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,660
La, pa, va.

263
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,580
Ba, pa, la, de.

264
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,900
Le, la, le, le, le.

265
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,460
Ye, ye, ye.

266
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,620
I'm at the club.

267
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,600
We're partying on that.

268
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,040
Yeah!

269
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,800
Yeah!

270
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,220
Yeah!

271
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,060
Ooh!

272
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,760
And that guy's... smoking?

273
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,440
Okay.

274
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,880
I thought he had binoculars and was people watching.

275
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,560
Nah.

276
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:52,920
Nah.

277
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,300
Nah.

278
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,640
Doh, doh, doh.

279
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,120
Nah, no.

280
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:55,900
Oh.

281
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,160
He's smoking.

282
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,160
Do I have to talk to him?

283
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:00,960
Nope.

284
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
I don't think so.

285
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,540
Can I go to the club?

286
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,500
No.

287
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,660
I have to go to the door.

288
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,460
Don't stop me!

289
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,620
Please sign... oh, hold on.

290
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,440
Please sign the waiver!

291
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,160
Okay, give me a second to... wait.

292
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,820
What waiver?

293
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,040
Don't read it, just sign it.

294
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,080
Yeah, but I don't know what this is.

295
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,360
Why is there a waiver?

296
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,540
Anyway, okay.

297
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,540
Oh, wait, hold on.

298
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,740
I'm signing general release of liability.

299
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,660
The words are kind of hard to read, aren't they?

300
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,760
All... of... I... waiver.

301
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,440
Can't see.

302
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,660
Me neither.

303
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,540
Okay, I guess I'm going to sign it anyway.

304
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,440
M-I-N-T-O.

305
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,820
I put my fake name.

306
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,840
Mucho texto.

307
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,380
One live round.

308
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,000
Two blanks.

309
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,920
I insert the shells in an unknown order.

310
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,020
I insert the shells in an unknown order.

311
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,100
Shooting yourself with a blank skips the dealer's turn.

312
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,660
How do I know if it's a blank?

313
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,650
One live, two blank.

314
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,310
You don't.

315
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:13,930
You don't.

316
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,970
What if I shoot him?

317
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,590
Oh, okay.

318
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,230
I either shoot me with it.

319
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,380
I'm shaking.

320
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,760
I'm so... I'm a little baby.

321
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm going to have...

322
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
All in, baby!

323
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:30,740
Baby!

324
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,880
Your turn!

325
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,060
Oh.

326
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,960
Oh, I shoot...

327
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,080
Now it's 50-50.

328
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,610
You think I should shoot him?

329
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,590
What if I shoot him?

330
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,530
And it doesn't work.

331
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,510
Then he'll shoot me.

332
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,630
All in, baby!

333
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,750
I got an achievement!

334
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,850
Successfully shoot yourself with 50-50 odds!

335
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,410
Anyway...

336
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,110
Bye-bye!

337
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,320
I win!

338
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,940
Three live rounds, two blanks!

339
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,940
They enter the chamber in a hidden sequence!

340
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,600
Wait, three live, two blanks.

341
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,940
Remember the basics of...

342
00:20:59,060 --> 00:20:59,980
Who dat?

343
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,540
Who is Baze?

344
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,540
Okay.

345
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,560
Three lives, two blanks feels a little...

346
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,440
Aren't there like also other items you can use?

347
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,300
Where are those?

348
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,520
Okay.

349
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,340
I'm shaking a little bit like a baby.

350
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,140
But I think I'm gonna take him.

351
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,060
Oh, later?

352
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,380
Okay.

353
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,780
I think I'm gonna shoot him.

354
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,420
I think I'm gonna shoot him.

355
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,440
Die!

356
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,610
Mito wins!

357
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,130
Let's make this a little more interesting.

358
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,150
Two items each.

359
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,130
More items before every load.

360
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,190
I got...

361
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,750
What is this?

362
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,470
A soda.

363
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,020
I got...

364
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,660
A magnifying glass?

365
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,520
Oh, a beer.

366
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,040
One live round, one blank!

367
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,060
He's got handcuffs and...

368
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,520
What is that?

369
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,380
Okay, check the current round in the chamber.

370
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:34,780
Oh!

371
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,080
Well, it's 50-50.

372
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,420
Racks the shotgun.

373
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,160
Ejects current shell.

374
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,660
Okay.

375
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,200
Oh, cigarettes.

376
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
So if I look at this...

377
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,240
Oh!

378
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,700
What the hell?

379
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,700
Is he gonna eat those?

380
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,060
Oh.

381
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,340
A little snack.

382
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,580
Oh, come on!

383
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,900
It was a little snack for him.

384
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,980
We knew that.

385
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,540
We knew that.

386
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,280
We knew that.

387
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:21,760
We knew that.

388
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,120
We knew that.

389
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,540
I think someone else also gave a fake name.

390
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,960
What is that?

391
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,500
Is that...

392
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,960
Two live rounds.

393
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,540
Two blanks.

394
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,350
Okay.

395
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,010
Dealer skips the next turn.

396
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,850
Oh, they are...

397
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,670
We also got the beer.

398
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,830
And then shotgun deals two damage!

399
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,050
Dealer skips the next turn.

400
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,590
So when do I use that?

401
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,510
Would I use that before?

402
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,050
Like, I click on it and then I...

403
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,210
Well, I guess I would have to, right?

404
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:23,930
Hmm.

405
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,330
You can use multiple items.

406
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:27,610
Oh!

407
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,030
I'm scared.

408
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,710
So two, two.

409
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,390
Hmm.

410
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,030
Hmm.

411
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,590
If I use the two damage and I shoot myself...

412
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,570
Is that a...

413
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,370
Is that on me?

414
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,670
Yeah, you take the two damage.

415
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,710
That would be kind of silly.

416
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,090
Hmm.

417
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:56,790
Okay.

418
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:57,590
Okay.

419
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,160
Okay.

420
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,540
It's like...

421
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,460
It's 50 -50, basically.

422
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,340
It's like basically 50-50.

423
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:06,860
Hmm.

424
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,360
It's like basically...

425
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,400
It's like...

426
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,000
Hmm.

427
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,480
Chug and cuff, baby!

428
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,040
It checks the current shell.

429
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,780
But I wanna do all the damage then.

430
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,380
I'm gonna...

431
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm gonna cuff him.

432
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,400
Hey, buddy.

433
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,900
And then...

434
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,980
We'll save the beer for later.

435
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,500
You know what?

436
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,660
I'm gonna... I'm gonna shoot him though.

437
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,180
Shoot!

438
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,480
Nice!

439
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,570
Always double down VTuber.

440
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,470
Okay!

441
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,250
I'm gonna shoot me then.

442
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,910
I'm scared though.

443
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,680
Beer o'clock?

444
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,480
Let me play the game, you guys.

445
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,060
Don't backseat.

446
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,090
Me!

447
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,600
Lady luck is on my side, baby!

448
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,400
Now it's actually 50-50.

449
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,580
Now it's really 50-50.

450
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,320
Imagine if this was the only...

451
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,280
The only casino game she's lucky with.

452
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,080
How do you think I died?

453
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,300
Well, that means I'm not lucky at all!

454
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,200
If I try shooting him with the two damp...

455
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,160
Well, I kinda wanna use this only when I...

456
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,780
When I...

457
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,760
When I for sure know that I have it in there.

458
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,640
If I...

459
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,040
If I drink...

460
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,220
I'm gonna drink.

461
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,940
Dang it!

462
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,700
I should have used it on him!

463
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,940
Beer o'clock, baby!

464
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,360
His shackles...

465
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,220
Rip live.

466
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,300
I know, I thought maybe it would be a blank.

467
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,420
More beer!

468
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,820
More beer!

469
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,830
I have a problem.

470
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,470
I think.

471
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,210
Three live!

472
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,090
Two blank.

473
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,270
Don't love the overconfidence, but I love your laugh!

474
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,090
Ay-ay-ay!

475
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,270
I'm gonna put away the knife at least.

476
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,530
Since we're not...

477
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,930
We'll bring it out when I use it.

478
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,210
Chug, baby!

479
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,410
No, I think I should shoot him.

480
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,430
I think I should shoot him.

481
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,490
No beer o'clock right now!

482
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,190
Yeah!

483
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,830
Oh, he's...

484
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,310
He's gaming.

485
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:56,790
Wait.

486
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,390
Wait a second!

487
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:57,870
Wait a second!

488
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,690
Very interesting.

489
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,210
He's gaming!

490
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,190
Don't shoot me!

491
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,190
Hey,

492
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:26,530
dealer!

493
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,950
Wait!

494
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:27,830
Wait a second!

495
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,430
Wait a second!

496
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,930
Wait a second!

497
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,850
Wait a second!

498
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,830
Wait a second!

499
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,190
I totally lost track of everything.

500
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,910
What is this?

501
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,230
Oh, these are the cigarettes!

502
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,070
I'm gonna eat them.

503
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,850
Three live round.

504
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,490
Three blank.

505
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,250
Oh, okay, okay.

506
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,850
He went through the whole thing!

507
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,350
I'm gonna get a charge back.

508
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,070
Nice.

509
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,510
Three live...

510
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,210
Three...

511
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,610
Should I do the two damage?

512
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,430
If I get lucky, I can...

513
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:11,810
I can...

514
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,710
I can kill him.

515
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,370
I think.

516
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,670
I think I could try and kill him.

517
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:20,570
Oh!

518
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:21,650
Oh!

519
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,130
Don't point it at yourself though, man.

520
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,290
Don't point it at yourself.

521
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,290
Here we go.

522
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,870
Oh.

523
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,540
Uh-oh.

524
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:32,900
Oh.

525
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,520
Oh, no!

526
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,140
The dealer's stupid!

527
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,170
No!

528
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,750
Okay, we're free.

529
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,410
Wait.

530
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,270
Oh, shoot.

531
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,170
Okay, hold on.

532
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,390
Um...

533
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,110
Ah, okay.

534
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,070
He shot me twice.

535
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,270
And himself.

536
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:31,950
No.

537
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:32,610
He shot...

538
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,110
himself once.

539
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,030
Me...

540
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,570
once.

541
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:40,930
It's a blank?

542
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,650
Are you sure?

543
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,390
Okay.

544
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,100
Oh, he drank one!

545
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,580
That's right!

546
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,040
That's right!

547
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,420
That's right!

548
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,420
You're right.

549
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:51,720
You're right.

550
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,240
So me.

551
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,430
Alright.

552
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,510
Let's grab some goodies.

553
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,190
Oh.

554
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,630
Alright.

555
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:05,490
Oh!

556
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,570
It's really beer o'clock right now.

557
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,310
Five live!

558
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,290
Two bl-

559
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,790
If I use it, it doesn't waste my turn, right?

560
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,630
Oh,

561
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,230
it was a blank!

562
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:40,910
It was a blank!

563
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,530
It was a blank!

564
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,650
It was a blank!

565
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,130
It was a blank!

566
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,110
Live.

567
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:57,410
But if the next one is also alive...

568
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,130
You're...

569
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:01,410
Thanks for going!

570
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,880
Thanks for going!

571
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:11,920
Alrighty.

572
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,700
Alrighty.

573
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,040
I'm just gonna shoot them.

574
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,840
I'm just gonna shoot them.

575
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
Oh, shit!

576
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,220
No!

577
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,400
Oh!

578
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,320
Now I...

579
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,440
I didn't think I'd lose!

580
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,120
The

581
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,760
final showdown!

582
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,420
No more defibrillators!

583
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,920
No more blood transfusions!

584
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,640
No!

585
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,220
The deep end!

586
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,040
The healer is so dumb!

587
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,320
What is that?

588
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,210
What's happening?

589
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,230
Four items each.

590
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,190
No luck, pure skill.

591
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,110
Wait,

592
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,910
these don't even matter though, right?

593
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,090
This is good, this is good.

594
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,290
Because it said no defibrillators.

595
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,310
You know the drill.

596
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,260
Oh, they do still matter?

597
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,440
It still works?

598
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:24,610
Oh, and they matter until the cables are cut.

599
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,550
Alright.

600
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,750
He also has...

601
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,290
Oh, he has almost the same stuff as me.

602
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,010
He just got a beer instead.

603
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,890
I thought... I thought it was one hit kill.

604
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,050
Okay, I get it now.

605
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:41,690
Okay.

606
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,190
I think I'm just gonna check though, honestly.

607
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,150
Nice!

608
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
And then it was one live, two blank, right?

609
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,660
Use it on me, I dare you.

610
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,480
Oh, okay.

611
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,640
You're a little smarty in your pants, aren't you?

612
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,860
Nice, nice, nice.

613
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:30,960
Beer.

614
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,500
Nice, nice, nice!

615
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,080
Oh!

616
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,360
Okay.

617
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,980
Oh!

618
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,160
Wait, so four and four, right?

619
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,100
Four live, four blank?

620
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,480
Okay.

621
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,340
Um...

622
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,220
I am once again checking!

623
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,280
I'm scared though.

624
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,020
I should beer it instead?

625
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,960
Oh, I don't think I can put it back down.

626
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,320
It's okay though.

627
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,610
Alright, and that skipped his turn.

628
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,250
I don't know if I'm doing this all in the right order, but you know what?

629
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:34,470
Whatever.

630
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:35,390
Ah!

631
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,830
This is good.

632
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,050
Yeah, I figured the beer would be a waste if I knew what it was.

633
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,050
So...

634
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,340
Okay.

635
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,940
Are you ready?

636
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,120
For what?

637
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:08,880
Ah!

638
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,520
Oh, his got caught.

639
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,790
Okay, so...

640
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,370
Hold on.

641
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,050
It was four and four.

642
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,030
I had one blank.

643
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,590
And two live.

644
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:31,720
Right?

645
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,280
So it's three and...

646
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,540
Wait.

647
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,400
Three and three now.

648
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,280
Okay.

649
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,390
One...

650
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,570
One live with two damage?

651
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,930
Ah!

652
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,310
Wait.

653
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,610
You're right, you're right, you're right.

654
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:57,850
Yes.

655
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,740
Oh yeah, you can see the shells on the table.

656
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,380
You're right.

657
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,260
So it is three and...

658
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,460
Okay.

659
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,280
I'm gonna do the beer.

660
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,180
Hopefully it's not a live one.

661
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,500
Ah!

662
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,840
Ma!

663
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,020
Just shoot him!

664
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,860
I might die though.

665
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:22,880
Ah!

666
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,660
Uh-oh.

667
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,140
Uh-oh.

668
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,740
Uh-oh.

669
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:32,800
Uh -oh.

670
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,080
Uh-oh.

671
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,360
Uh

672
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:42,990
-oh.

673
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:43,110
Uh -oh.

674
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,810
I think he's dumb.

675
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,730
I think he's dumb!

676
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,770
I think he's really stupid!

677
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,220
Minto wins by doing nothing!

678
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:40,990
What?

679
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,770
What?

680
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,690
What did this mean?

681
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,530
I think I was dorks kicked too.

682
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,190
How was it that there were no more dorks to kick?

683
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,870
He threw.

684
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:55,950
We are through!

685
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,600
Double or nothing on...

686
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,940
Double or nothing!

687
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,640
First try!

688
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,420
But there goes all your luck for the year!

689
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,220
Oh no!

690
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,540
Thank you!

691
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,740
Oh my gosh!

692
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,680
I left for five minutes.

693
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,240
What happened?

694
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,460
How did you win so quickly?

695
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,320
I don't know!

696
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,680
I think I speedrun the game!

697
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,560
Let's try the double or nothing, right?

698
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,360
Do nothing.

699
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,160
Competition shoots itself in the face.

700
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,520
What is this strategy called?

701
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Is this it?

702
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,050
Oh!

703
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,530
This is just like the leaderboard stuff.

704
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,310
Oh!

705
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,390
Check the leaderboard.

706
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:58,610
Oh!

707
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,450
What the?

708
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,570
I don't even know what these mean.

709
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,630
What are these numbers?

710
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,910
Are these like high school...

711
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,070
What does this mean?

712
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,770
Take the pills?

713
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,250
Where are the pills at?

714
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,350
These ones?

715
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:13,770
Oh!

716
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,770
May impair your ability to drive.

717
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:18,730
Okay!

718
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,490
Consume the double or nothing pills.

719
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,350
Soap.

720
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,550
Oh!

721
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,430
Our guy is gone!

722
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,370
There's another door over there.

723
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,030
I think I could kick that one in.

724
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,690
If it let me over there.

725
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,290
Sometimes the music...

726
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:03,770
After you fire a blank, you should swap your case for one of the remaining cases.

727
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:03,890
You are so tight.

728
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,030
For better odds!

729
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,510
I'm sorry!

730
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,690
Best at magic!

731
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,890
Deal or no deal!

732
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,990
Damn you!

733
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,090
I...

734
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:19,510
I'll 너무 tweet tourism!

735
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:19,650
I'm almost on a top!

736
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,650
I will...

737
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,210
I got to see the back door before I get on my way.

738
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,730
There, there, maybe one of them makes eye contact with De Yeshua.

739
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,470
Here we go.

740
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,810
Hi.

741
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,570
There is one more.

742
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,770
Once Come back to the знужки dijằ� servant.

743
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,730
Minto's ready.

744
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:38,810
Please sign the waiver.

745
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,290
Look how happy he is.

746
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,140
Minto!

747
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,540
I gave him a fake name.

748
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,020
I gave him a fake name.

749
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,280
What the heck is that?

750
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,040
Nice.

751
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,520
More medicine.

752
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:23,810
Two and two.

753
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:28,530
Adrenaline!

754
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,410
Steal an item and use it immediately!

755
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,890
I could take his magnifying glass.

756
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,770
50% chance to regain two charges.

757
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,550
If not, lose one charge.

758
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:41,230
You guys, when it comes to...

759
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,390
When it comes to 50-50 chance...

760
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,370
I...

761
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,170
I've notoriously...

762
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,190
lost the 50-50 chance.

763
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,870
But you know, I'm gonna steal his glass.

764
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,050
Yoink!

765
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:05,910
Nice!

766
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,890
Get shot, bozo!

767
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,770
Oh, he's probably gonna smoke his signal.

768
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,150
I'm gonna...

769
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,990
But he has to waste it.

770
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,090
I grip...

771
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,290
You grab him with these big old grippers.

772
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,090
Grab those.

773
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,660
It was two alive, one blank, wasn't it?

774
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,680
The odds were in his favor.

775
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,100
Speaking of, when I was on the plane there and back...

776
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,180
I basically watched almost the whole Hunger Games series.

777
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,900
Am I in the last movie?

778
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,500
Like halfway through the last movie.

779
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,580
Oh yeah, it's two blank.

780
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,360
You're right, you're right.

781
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,620
It was 2-2.

782
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,180
How was it?

783
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:16,760
I've never watched it?

784
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,840
I really liked it.

785
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,180
I like could not stop watching them.

786
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,180
I was like, oh my gosh, I'm just gonna keep watching Hunger Games.

787
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,780
I can see why so many people are obsessed with it.

788
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,320
I liked them.

789
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,000
Alright, let's get some more goodies.

790
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:35,680
Yay!

791
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:36,580
Cigarettes!

792
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,320
Knife.

793
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,180
Yeah!

794
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:40,620
Adrenaline!

795
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,920
What'd you get?

796
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,800
I'm gonna take it.

797
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,480
Two blanks and one live.

798
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,260
What's that thing?

799
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:49,900
Wait, what is that?

800
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,020
What is that thing?

801
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,100
Converts shells.

802
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,600
Inverts the current shell?

803
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,940
Wait, so if I use the magnifying glass and if it's...

804
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,140
If it's a blank, I could use this and it'll turn it into a live?

805
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,940
There's a blank!

806
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,980
I'm not afraid of that!

807
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,780
Okay, so now...

808
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,980
See ya, sucker!

809
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,020
You're scaring me today.

810
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,300
No, no, no, it's mine.

811
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:58,760
It's fine.

812
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,680
Oh yeah, you got a little...

813
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,100
You're gonna eat those.

814
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,320
You got a little snack for ya.

815
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,600
It's okay.

816
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,340
Wait, he could lose a life right now.

817
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,480
Wait...

818
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,180
Oh no!

819
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,340
You son of a bitch.

820
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,820
What is that thing?

821
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,780
Okay, 50-50.

822
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,960
Actually 50-50.

823
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,340
Actually 50-50.

824
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,660
They replaced the dealer.

825
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,780
It's a phone.

826
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,820
I'm wondering if I should do the pills and maybe get two?

827
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,080
What's the max I can have?

828
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,270
Oh, four.

829
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,530
Okay, what you started with.

830
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:32,950
Okay, okay.

831
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:35,430
I'm gonna...

832
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,530
I think...

833
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:37,450
I don't...

834
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,390
I'll see what the phone does, but I'm gonna smoke.

835
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,750
I don't wanna do the...

836
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,770
I'm not ready to take the 50-50 chance yet.

837
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,630
But I will take his handcuffs.

838
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:46,970
But I also wanna see what the phone does.

839
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:48,190
Cha!

840
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:51,390
I can hear everything.

841
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:55,370
A mysterious voice gives you insight from the future.

842
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,690
Yeah, but I'm just gonna take that.

843
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,910
Oh, I forgot that it makes it...

844
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,450
It makes you use it immediately.

845
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,590
Wait, so if I just...

846
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:11,570
If I shoot it at him...

847
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,270
It doesn't...

848
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:12,950
It doesn't really matter.

849
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,050
But do I want...

850
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,030
Oh well, I already wasted it.

851
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:17,430
It's fine.

852
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,130
It's fine.

853
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,250
Okay, okay.

854
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,610
Now we can use the...

855
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:22,410
Actually, this is good.

856
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:23,250
This is good.

857
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:23,670
This is good.

858
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,330
Because then...

859
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,310
We use the knife.

860
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,070
Nice, nice, nice.

861
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:27,770
There we go.

862
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:29,010
Thank you.

863
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:29,310
Thank you.

864
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:31,250
Thank you.

865
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:31,870
Thank you.

866
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:36,010
I guess lady luck must be paying you back for years of screwing you over.

867
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,790
There we go, everybody.

868
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,950
Give me some items.

869
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:50,230
What is that?

870
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,430
Oh, that's the phone.

871
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:54,530
The polarity.

872
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,070
Uh-oh.

873
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:57,830
He can steal my...

874
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,230
Steal my stuff.

875
00:50:58,670 --> 00:50:59,030
Okay.

876
00:50:59,090 --> 00:50:59,810
Two live, two blank.

877
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,310
Two, two.

878
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,910
I'm gonna...

879
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,130
I'm gonna try and use the phone.

880
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:16,270
Okay.

881
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,250
Second shell blank.

882
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,090
Okay.

883
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:22,790
Oh.

884
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,430
I guess I don't need that anymore.

885
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:28,290
So...

886
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,250
If the second shell is blank...

887
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:32,450
Joy!

888
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:33,790
Thank you for the 50.

889
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:34,770
Thank you.

890
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:35,250
Thank you.

891
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:37,750
Um...

892
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,060
I think I should shoot it.

893
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,460
Right?

894
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,780
The first shell is still unknown.

895
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,460
Okay.

896
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,640
How many...

897
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,120
It was two and two, wasn't it?

898
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:09,960
Okay.

899
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:10,880
I'm gonna shoot him.

900
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:16,640
Okay.

901
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:17,620
Nice.

902
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,040
Nice.

903
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:18,320
Nice.

904
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,180
Now we know this one is blank.

905
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,200
Hopefully he doesn't use it on himself.

906
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,380
Dang it!

907
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,340
He knew.

908
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:35,880
He knew.

909
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,260
I knew it.

910
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,090
Wait, what was that?

911
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,570
Oh, he just stole that!

912
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,410
Wait, why did you beat it up?

913
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:57,970
Wait a second.

914
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,110
Did that...

915
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,910
Careful now, guys!

916
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:06,690
You guys!

917
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,390
It all depends on what I get, you guys.

918
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:15,780
Okay, the polarity...

919
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,310
Handcuffs!

920
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,470
The polarity!

921
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,150
Beer!

922
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:23,530
Handcuffs!

923
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,960
Four and four.

924
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,880
He can steal my items and he can see!

925
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,660
I'm gonna handcuff him, first and foremost.

926
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,180
Yeah.

927
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:45,660
Yeah.

928
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,120
Smile when I handcuff you.

929
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,180
And then I'm gonna...

930
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,180
I'm gonna beer it.

931
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,240
Beer o'clock, baby!

932
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:58,620
Eject!

933
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,200
It was alive!

934
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,740
Okay, so now we're at four and three.

935
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,120
Thank you!

936
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:11,460
Thank you!

937
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,160
Beer!

938
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:12,940
Beer!

939
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,560
Everyone, my Goshi!

940
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:25,840
If I ever had the opportunity to go to a con that would deliver gifts, would you be interested in a half pound of honey?

941
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:35,820
I would love honey, but I don't think... I don't think I can accept anything that's like food.

942
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,760
But I appreciate it.

943
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,140
I just settled on gifting you a candle.

944
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,420
That I would love as well.

945
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,480
I go through candles like crazy.

946
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,880
I'm already always like... I'm having to summon my friends, you know?

947
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,840
That's how you summon with a candle, the ghost, you know, whatever.

948
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,320
I'll take the honey.

949
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,480
Invert and bet.

950
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,140
You're right.

951
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:06,620
We could try.

952
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,040
We could try.

953
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,210
But he's also gonna be handcuffed, so...

954
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:16,910
Ah!

955
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:19,670
It was live!

956
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:20,790
Wait a second.

957
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:21,990
So that means...

958
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,050
Oh, I can't use the handcuffs again.

959
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:32,610
That means... That means now there's only two live and four blank.

960
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:33,990
Oh my gosh.

961
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:35,690
Right?

962
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:39,190
Invert again.

963
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:39,970
Okay!

964
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:46,530
I'm telling you guys, if it comes to a 50-50 chance, it's kind of hard for me.

965
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,640
Ah!

966
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,180
Beep, beep!

967
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,840
Beep-toe wins!

968
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,600
Oh!

969
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,040
Yeah, take those off.

970
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,560
Give me some goodies.

971
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,340
Smokes.

972
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,100
Phone.

973
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,320
Okay.

974
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:20,640
Yippee!

975
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,880
Two and two.

976
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,040
Two and two.

977
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,360
Oh, he's also got a phone.

978
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,720
And a beer.

979
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,550
Second shell blank.

980
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,130
Second shell blank?

981
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:41,350
I think I'm gonna risk it.

982
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:44,330
I think I'm gonna shoot him.

983
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:46,850
I think I'm gonna shoot him.

984
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,640
Uh-oh.

985
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,420
So that means the last two.

986
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,660
It's the last two.

987
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,360
It's the last two.

988
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,000
It's the last two.

989
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:57,580
It's the last two.

990
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,800
Thank you for the 10 gifts and thank you!

991
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,700
Careful now.

992
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:23,830
Now we shoot.

993
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,590
Ka-pow-ee!

994
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,270
How did you like that?

995
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,760
What do we got?

996
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:39,440
Oh.

997
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,160
Steel.

998
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,260
Beer.

999
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,310
Three lives, four blank.

1000
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:48,770
Okay.

1001
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,550
Okay, three live, four blank, three live, four blank.

1002
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:53,230
Oh, all he's got are...

1003
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,570
Wait, I could steal.

1004
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:57,590
It's probably better to steal the magnifying glass, right?

1005
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:58,410
I'd rather not.

1006
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:59,830
Thanks for the 10 gifted, thank you!

1007
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,690
Oh my gosh, why is the audio all crackly?

1008
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:12,230
I think, what order should I do?

1009
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:16,930
Let's steal it first, and then beer it.

1010
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,350
Steal it, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1011
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,970
It was three live, four blank, right?

1012
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:34,420
Three live, four blank, three live, four, okay, thank you.

1013
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:42,610
So, if I do the beer first, I'm gonna do the beer first.

1014
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,290
To get rid of something.

1015
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,170
Okay, now it's three blank, three live.

1016
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,450
Adrenaline, yeah, give it to me.

1017
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:57,710
Yeah, I can.

1018
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,710
I can see everything!

1019
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:05,050
Yeah, yeah!

1020
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:06,530
Let's play!

1021
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:08,730
Yeah!

1022
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,080
Yippee!

1023
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:26,220
Joy, thank you for the 50 gifts, thank you so much!

1024
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,760
Thank you!

1025
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,540
Thank you!

1026
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,000
Oh, cancuffs, nice.

1027
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,320
Cell phone, nice.

1028
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,320
Howl, howl, howl, howl, howl.

1029
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:40,940
Beep!

1030
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:43,660
Four and four?

1031
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,400
Four and four, okay, he's got the smokes, he's got the polarizer.

1032
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,910
Fifth shell, blank.

1033
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:06,090
Wow, thanks.

1034
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:07,710
Thanks a whole lot.

1035
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:09,470
Thanks a lot.

1036
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,530
Wait, okay, it was four and four.

1037
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:19,530
Look at what beer o'clock has done to my Oshii.

1038
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:24,870
Four and four.

1039
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,980
So you know it's four and three now.

1040
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:32,720
True.

1041
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,460
So I guess we'll shoot.

1042
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,500
Yeah!

1043
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:38,740
Yeah!

1044
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:45,030
Argentinian greets you from Argentina!

1045
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:46,090
Hola!

1046
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,070
Gracias!

1047
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:49,990
Noa Blue!

1048
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,080
Okay.

1049
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:56,360
Now it's...

1050
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,940
Now it's three...

1051
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:02,440
And...

1052
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:05,860
And...

1053
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,840
And...

1054
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,330
Three live, four blank.

1055
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:20,610
Yes.

1056
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:20,790
Yes.

1057
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,750
He's gonna regain life.

1058
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,250
He's gonna use his cigarette.

1059
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:30,970
I think I'm just gonna shoot him.

1060
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,410
I think I'm just gonna try.

1061
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:42,990
Yopi!

1062
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:45,450
I killed the...

1063
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:49,650
What's happening?

1064
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:50,870
Double or nothing?

1065
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,890
Is that a thing?

1066
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:22,700
More?

1067
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:23,140
Nice.

1068
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,440
Thank you for the AkoSuba!

1069
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,860
Alidia... Alidia... Alidia...

1070
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,140
Alidia, I hope I said your name right.

1071
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:31,540
Thank you!

1072
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:31,900
Okay.

1073
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,200
Um, wait.

1074
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:39,960
Uh-oh.

1075
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,040
I didn't see it.

1076
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,380
Oh, 50-50!

1077
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,300
50-50?

1078
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:46,640
Okay.

1079
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,500
Second shell live!

1080
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,260
One to one.

1081
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:54,980
One to one.

1082
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:55,520
One to one.

1083
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,240
And he has two steels!

1084
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,140
He has two of them.

1085
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,460
And a pack of cigarettes.

1086
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,320
He's gonna heal himself.

1087
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,280
Okay.

1088
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:21,820
Cell phone.

1089
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,400
Magnifying glass.

1090
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:24,500
Steel!

1091
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:28,600
Out of space.

1092
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,160
How unfortunate.

1093
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:33,700
No!

1094
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,020
Alright.

1095
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,120
Two and two.

1096
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:39,980
Two and two.

1097
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:40,820
Two and two.

1098
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:41,860
Two and two.

1099
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,200
Pick a door.

1100
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:43,800
One, two, three.

1101
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:45,180
Two!

1102
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,220
Okay, okay.

1103
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:50,520
Hold on.

1104
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,240
Alright.

1105
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:52,940
Two and two.

1106
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:58,020
I'm gonna cuff him first.

1107
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,360
I'm going to...

1108
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
But I could end this.

1109
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,040
Maybe I shouldn't have cuffed him.

1110
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:05,880
You know what?

1111
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:06,640
It's fine.

1112
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,120
I just realized.

1113
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,080
But it's okay.

1114
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:11,440
It's okay.

1115
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:11,740
It's okay.

1116
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:12,120
It's okay.

1117
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:12,420
It's okay.

1118
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:12,660
It's okay.

1119
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:12,860
It's okay.

1120
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,340
Just in case.

1121
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:13,780
Just in case.

1122
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,220
Just in case.

1123
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,300
Just in case something goes awry.

1124
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:18,900
And I... And then he heals, you know?

1125
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:19,680
Um...

1126
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,460
You could steal his adrenaline.

1127
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,620
That is true, actually.

1128
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:32,000
If I got it and then stole his other one, he wouldn't be able to use it at all.

1129
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,160
And steal any of my stuff.

1130
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,220
I'd say steal his glass.

1131
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,100
But then he can steal mine back.

1132
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,120
You can't steal a steel?

1133
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:49,860
Oh, wow.

1134
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,440
Yeah.

1135
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,500
Let's steal his glass then.

1136
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,680
So he can't use it.

1137
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,400
And then we'll just take him out.

1138
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,180
I'm going to lose my items here, right?

1139
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:09,520
Aren't I?

1140
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,620
Or do I get to keep them?

1141
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,400
What's wrong, Mr. Dealer?

1142
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,300
Pinto wins!

1143
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:28,940
Second round.

1144
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,440
Alright.

1145
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,660
Yeah, see, we lost everything anyway.

1146
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:37,580
Handcuffs.

1147
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:38,840
Medicine.

1148
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,300
Beer.

1149
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,460
Beer.

1150
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:42,840
Oh.

1151
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:45,660
Three!

1152
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,380
Oh, four and four!

1153
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,240
Four and four.

1154
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:51,220
Four and four.

1155
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,060
Half of them!

1156
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,760
Pretty little dainty hands!

1157
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,060
I'm going to beer.

1158
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:03,720
Kasha!

1159
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:06,740
And...

1160
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:08,560
Okay...

1161
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,880
So now it's four and three.

1162
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,300
Four blank, three live.

1163
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:21,760
I'm gonna do another one.

1164
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,780
I just made it!

1165
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:31,880
Okay...

1166
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,020
Hmm...

1167
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,680
Back to 50-50.

1168
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,280
Let's see what we can do.

1169
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:45,400
Back to 50-50.

1170
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:45,460
Okay...

1171
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:45,500
Let's see what we can do.

1172
01:06:55,530 --> 01:07:05,210
I'm scared... if I use... if I... I think I might use it on myself, because then I will... then it will... it will... skip him.

1173
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:10,090
I'll be able to use it again, because I don't want him to handcuff me and be able to like, you know... he's got a lot of stuff.

1174
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:13,330
He's got a lot of stuff.

1175
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:19,970
I think I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna go for me.

1176
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:22,570
Drugs first?

1177
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:23,550
No, why would I use that?

1178
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:31,270
Medicaid for the gamble.

1179
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:35,010
No, that makes... I didn't lose anything before.

1180
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:41,390
Okay, so now it's... three... three blank, two live.

1181
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:54,570
Pills?

1182
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,810
This might be dumb.

1183
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,070
Oh.

1184
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:19,450
GG everybody.

1185
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:26,810
GG everybody.

1186
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,000
Dealer!

1187
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,280
What, you're gonna take my pills?

1188
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,400
Just take them!

1189
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:06,580
Dang.

1190
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,910
Thank you for reading my message.

1191
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:13,870
Thank you!

1192
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:20,790
The ten dollars.

1193
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:25,550
You win some, you lose some.

1194
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:26,790
Dang it.

1195
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:30,610
Alright, let's... let's... do I do this one again?

1196
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:31,710
Consume the pills?

1197
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,750
Pills time.

1198
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:39,390
I'm feeling a little woozy!

1199
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:43,390
The pills!

1200
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:46,210
The pills are hitting!

1201
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:53,270
Let's go shoot a guy!

1202
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:56,910
Sign any waiver!

1203
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,130
Just give it to me!

1204
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,630
Put your name!

1205
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,050
Minto!

1206
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:07,390
Eto!

1207
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:09,310
Yeah!

1208
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:14,750
I'm ready.

1209
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:15,590
Give me the goods!

1210
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,810
Gimme, gimme!

1211
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:17,850
Oh yeah!

1212
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:19,730
Sweet, sweet knife!

1213
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:20,110
Yes!

1214
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,230
Oh yes!

1215
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:25,350
A phone, a phone, a phone!

1216
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:31,510
Three and three!

1217
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:35,130
Look how happy he is!

1218
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:36,250
Just like me!

1219
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,170
He knows the game, he knows the game!

1220
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:42,070
Moshi moshi!

1221
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:42,270
Moshi!

1222
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:45,310
Fifth shi...

1223
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,090
Why you must tell me useless information!

1224
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:52,590
Um...

1225
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:58,610
Hold on, I'm doing girl math.

1226
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,170
So...

1227
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:04,530
If he...

1228
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:05,470
Uh...

1229
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:06,210
Wait...

1230
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:06,750
No...

1231
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,950
Sorry, I sound like a father figure.

1232
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:13,350
Uh...

1233
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,850
Three, three, fifth blank.

1234
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:18,350
So it's...

1235
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,690
No, it said fifth is the live round.

1236
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:21,750
Didn't it?

1237
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:25,210
Fifth is the live round.

1238
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,120
I'm just gonna shoot myself.

1239
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,080
Yeah!

1240
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,760
That's the name of the game!

1241
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:33,480
Ah!

1242
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:37,600
Ah!

1243
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:39,100
Ah!

1244
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:39,400
Ah!

1245
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,060
Ah!

1246
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:40,540
Ah!

1247
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:40,620
Ah!

1248
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:40,760
Ah!

1249
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:40,820
Ah!

1250
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:41,120
Ah!

1251
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:41,380
Ah!

1252
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:41,560
Ah!

1253
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:42,700
Yeah!

1254
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:48,280
Um...

1255
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:49,180
Hmm.

1256
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:56,750
Now it a...

1257
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:57,330
Hold on...

1258
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:57,990
Now it's...

1259
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:00,470
One blank, or rather...

1260
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:01,370
Two blank.

1261
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:05,990
Three is live, but we know the fifth one is...

1262
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:07,190
Is...

1263
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:07,810
A blank.

1264
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:08,630
No, is live.

1265
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:12,770
Yeah, I think I am gonna knife it.

1266
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:31,570
You know my grandma used to, there was a guy, when my grandma used to live in like the old people's home, and there was a guy that used to bother, that used to bother her, and she would always tell him, she was just like, if you don't cut it out, if you don't,

1267
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:42,710
if you don't leave me alone, my, she was talking about my grandpa, she was like, my husband's up there, and he's filing his teeth down to a point, and he's gonna rip your throat out!

1268
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,710
My grandpa only ever made soup.

1269
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,600
Anyway, shoot the dealer!

1270
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,490
Oh no, he's got the cigarettes though.

1271
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,780
Okay, so one blank.

1272
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,280
That was the second round, this is the third one.

1273
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:19,980
Oh!

1274
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,040
Oh!

1275
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,180
What?

1276
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,380
The thrill of knowing.

1277
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,700
Yeah, very interesting, huh?

1278
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,180
What are you gonna do with that information?

1279
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:27,460
Oh!

1280
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:31,980
Oh, oh!

1281
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,180
This is the fourth one?

1282
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:42,250
Yeah!

1283
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,430
Bring me back to life!

1284
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,970
But this is the fifth one, right?

1285
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:55,490
This is the fifth round?

1286
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,110
So, I should...

1287
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,910
Fire it up, baby!

1288
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:08,430
Eat this!

1289
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:09,490
Yeah!

1290
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:18,570
The thrill of the pills.

1291
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:19,730
I mean, the shot.

1292
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:21,270
The buckshot.

1293
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,350
It's starting to wear down.

1294
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:31,490
Where am I?

1295
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:31,790
Where am I?

1296
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:35,130
I'm gonna call my mom.

1297
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,010
The polarity.

1298
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:39,350
Ooh!

1299
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:40,930
Whoa, wait.

1300
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:43,530
You're a...

1301
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:45,550
Quick!

1302
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:46,670
Oh, bad!

1303
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:47,050
Oh!

1304
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:48,010
Welcome back, Mito!

1305
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:49,590
Did you notice the BTD plushie?

1306
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:50,310
BTD?

1307
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:50,510
What?

1308
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:51,470
Bloods?

1309
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:51,990
Oh, shoot!

1310
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:52,850
Wait, what was it?

1311
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:53,130
You guys?

1312
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,170
Don't donate what I'm trying to...

1313
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,780
Like the TV model.

1314
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,500
Oh, 1-1?

1315
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,660
Oh, okay, okay.

1316
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,640
1-1.

1317
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:10,730
Second shell blank.

1318
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:12,710
Awesome.

1319
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,640
He's probably gonna win that, though.

1320
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:31,160
Oh, well.

1321
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,020
Bloodthirsty Mito Ibuki.

1322
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,120
Quick maths.

1323
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,340
Solidus!

1324
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,060
You asshole!

1325
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,940
What are you stealing from me?

1326
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,740
Not my smokes!

1327
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,120
He took my medicine!

1328
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,440
And he's taking even more medicine!

1329
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,540
Lose the 50-50!

1330
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,340
Lose the 50-50!

1331
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,060
Lose the 50-50!

1332
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,760
He never loses!

1333
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:15,280
What a jerk.

1334
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,140
What a jerk!

1335
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:24,980
Cuffs.

1336
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,500
Nice.

1337
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:31,190
1-1 again.

1338
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:35,150
Grandma, get him.

1339
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:36,470
Grandpa, yank his throat out.

1340
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:38,490
Grandpa, I make cream of mushroom and corn soup.

1341
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:40,610
Basically.

1342
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,490
Okay, I can steal his...

1343
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:53,930
I'm thinking either his phone or his handcuffs.

1344
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:59,830
If we steal the phone, we'll know exactly what is what.

1345
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:02,190
But he's just gonna re-heal, you know?

1346
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:03,690
I don't even have a saw.

1347
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:06,150
Hmm...

1348
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:18,130
Hmm...

1349
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:19,650
How many shells?

1350
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:20,910
Just two, and it's 50-50.

1351
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:21,950
Well, yeah.

1352
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,110
Of course it would be.

1353
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:25,550
So one live, one blank.

1354
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,570
I think I will steal the handcuffs.

1355
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:34,970
Yeah!

1356
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:38,850
I see it all!

1357
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:41,990
Oh yeah, you can't steal the adrenaline.

1358
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,790
I see every...

1359
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:45,350
Oh, wait!

1360
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:08,710
There's a time limit?

1361
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:15,940
What?

1362
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,240
There's a time limit?

1363
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:20,860
I

1364
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,220
don't even know what to do.

1365
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:50,450
Shoot him?

1366
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,730
Well, I did handcuff him, so you're right.

1367
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:54,170
Nice!

1368
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,340
I messed up.

1369
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,320
I messed up.

1370
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,200
I pressed escape.

1371
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,900
We even have a pressed escape.

1372
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,240
I think...

1373
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,340
Wait, is it hold escape to exit the game?

1374
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,140
Or...

1375
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,480
I can't tell if I'm gonna exit the game...

1376
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,580
I think it's hold escape to exit the game, you guys.

1377
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,280
I think it's...

1378
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:33,180
I think it's hold escape to exit the game.

1379
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:37,840
Hi!

1380
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,740
Okay, magnifying glass.

1381
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:46,860
Oh!

1382
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,180
Oh!

1383
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,580
I won't mess it up this time.

1384
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:51,780
Oh!

1385
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,240
50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50.

1386
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,080
50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50!

1387
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,260
I won't mess it up this time.

1388
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,180
Second shell blank!

1389
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,380
Okay, second shell blank.

1390
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:18,700
So...

1391
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,020
Handcuff him.

1392
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,980
So, what we're gonna do is we'll shoot him.

1393
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:28,020
And then I'll invert the polarity.

1394
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:28,400
Polarity.

1395
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:34,620
We got it.

1396
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:35,440
We got it this time.

1397
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,320
I got...

1398
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,800
I messed up a little bit last time but...

1399
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,120
We're fixing it this time.

1400
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,200
We're fixing it this time.

1401
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:57,400
What's wrong dealer?

1402
01:20:59,300 --> 01:20:59,820
Who's that?

1403
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,100
That's not my name.

1404
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,480
Who's that?

1405
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:11,460
Phone.

1406
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,360
Polarity.

1407
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:14,380
Polarity.

1408
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:15,740
Steal.

1409
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,860
You are under the influence.

1410
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:19,640
Oh.

1411
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,680
That's embarrassing.

1412
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,220
Three and Two!

1413
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,080
Three blank, two live.

1414
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,360
Three blank, two live.

1415
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:54,400
Third shell blank.

1416
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:07,390
That sounds like you drew a bad Scrapple hand.

1417
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,740
Now it's 50-50, but I cuffed him, so I think I should just shoot him.

1418
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:36,250
Wait, did it say the third one was blank or light?

1419
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:37,570
Oh crap, now I can't remember.

1420
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:44,840
Third is blank.

1421
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:45,520
Okay, okay.

1422
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,480
So this one...

1423
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,780
And it's... Okay, so now it's 50-50.

1424
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,240
So now it's two and two.

1425
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:56,680
Okay.

1426
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,700
Oh, this one's... Wait, okay, hold on.

1427
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,680
We can get a for sure shot in.

1428
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,380
We can get a for sure shot in if...

1429
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,840
The sec... Let's be honest, this one's probably live, right?

1430
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:16,500
This one... This next one is probably live.

1431
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,620
If I invert it to blank and shoot myself and then go again, but I invert it to live...

1432
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:28,480
Then I could get a... You know?

1433
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:30,920
Let's try it.

1434
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:38,820
And if I, you know... Shoot it...

1435
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:39,920
Ah, Si!

1436
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:40,340
Si!

1437
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:40,560
Si!

1438
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:40,780
Si!

1439
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:40,920
Si!

1440
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:56,510
Minto Gaming...

1441
01:23:59,270 --> 01:23:59,950
There we go.

1442
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:04,410
Oh, I forgot he had those.

1443
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:05,790
Lose, lose, lose!

1444
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:07,690
Why don't you ever lose?

1445
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:17,830
Yeah, dummy!

1446
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:22,730
Wait.

1447
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:28,590
Now, how many is left?

1448
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:31,090
There's only two things here.

1449
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:35,790
Only live left?

1450
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,420
Why don't sometimes the things show up?

1451
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,940
Sometimes they're on the table, sometimes they're not.

1452
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:47,480
It's so confusing.

1453
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,700
You know what, it's whatever.

1454
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,240
Yippee!

1455
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,740
Get me more stuff.

1456
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,240
Handcuffs.

1457
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:02,620
Phone.

1458
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:04,400
Knife.

1459
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,320
Handcuffs, nice.

1460
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,080
Pills here.

1461
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,240
Fifty-fifty!

1462
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,900
I wish I had the knife though.

1463
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:16,760
Oh, I do!

1464
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:21,680
I wish I had an inverter then.

1465
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:27,330
Second shell live.

1466
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:41,790
Cuffs?

1467
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:42,830
No, no, we'll save those.

1468
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:52,730
He doesn't even have anything to heal himself.

1469
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:55,510
So...

1470
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:12,880
Nice.

1471
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,060
Okay, we get more stuff.

1472
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,060
Steel!

1473
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:25,700
Beer.

1474
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,100
Phone.

1475
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:28,940
Knife.

1476
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,540
Okay.

1477
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,400
We gotta use everything.

1478
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,480
Okay, two and two.

1479
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:34,540
Two and two.

1480
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,800
No, no, no, no.

1481
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:37,920
No.

1482
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,700
First, I'm gonna cuff him.

1483
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:48,450
Then, I'm gonna phone.

1484
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:53,550
Third shell live.

1485
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,110
Okay, third shell is live.

1486
01:26:58,490 --> 01:26:59,470
Actually, you know what?

1487
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:00,330
What if I just did this?

1488
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:01,770
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1489
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:02,870
Ta!

1490
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,120
Ta!

1491
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:09,680
Oh!

1492
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:11,880
We know, we know, we know!

1493
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:12,640
We know everything!

1494
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:21,660
Oh!

1495
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,600
I didn't realize I killed him.

1496
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,440
Baby core, thanks for the five gift!

1497
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,060
Oh!

1498
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,880
Double or nothing!

1499
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,460
Nice shot, boss.

1500
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,420
Thank you!

1501
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:50,320
No!

1502
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,180
All in, baby!

1503
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,280
All in!

1504
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,040
All in!

1505
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,060
All in!

1506
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:56,600
All in!

1507
01:27:59,120 --> 01:27:59,740
All in!

1508
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:00,860
Reset the table.

1509
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:01,640
Oh!

1510
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:02,100
Nevermind.

1511
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:02,580
Just kidding.

1512
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:03,820
Don't reset the table.

1513
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,720
Ha ha ha!

1514
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:12,660
No!

1515
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:15,080
My magnifying glass!

1516
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:17,960
So unfair!

1517
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,660
Pyrofantix for the 20!

1518
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,540
Thank you so much!

1519
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,660
Shit, it was too fast.

1520
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:23,180
What was it?

1521
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,400
You guys!

1522
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,060
Help me, please!

1523
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:28,740
Oh, three and three.

1524
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:29,640
Oh, three and three.

1525
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:29,800
Oh, three and three.

1526
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:30,300
Okay, okay, okay.

1527
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:30,880
Three and three.

1528
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:37,900
Koffing.

1529
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,400
Koffing, baby.

1530
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:42,960
Beer o'clock.

1531
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:46,300
Oh!

1532
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,600
That was a blank.

1533
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:50,620
So now it's three live, two blank.

1534
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,860
Spam the beers, I know, right?

1535
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:03,680
True.

1536
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:05,300
Actually, I was thinking of doing it anyway.

1537
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,060
It might be...

1538
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:08,220
Now...

1539
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:08,980
Now it's...

1540
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,520
Oh!

1541
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:11,020
It's two and two again.

1542
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:11,820
It's two and two.

1543
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:15,040
It's two and two.

1544
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:28,420
I was thinking spam the beers two through because I'm thirsty.

1545
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,260
Oh, he's coughed!

1546
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:33,580
You're right!

1547
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,240
He is coughed.

1548
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:36,500
I forgot.

1549
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,280
I think I'm actually gonna do a polarity change.

1550
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,240
Okay.

1551
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:50,640
I think I'm gonna do the polarity change.

1552
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,720
He has the cigarettes to heal himself.

1553
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,100
Why?

1554
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:57,780
Just cause.

1555
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:00,300
What?

1556
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:02,220
We got...

1557
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,440
It's fine, though.

1558
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:06,880
It's fine.

1559
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:11,620
So now it's one live, two blank.

1560
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,420
Okay.

1561
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:15,880
So now it's three and three.

1562
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:16,740
It's two and four.

1563
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,360
That's...

1564
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,420
That's how it goes.

1565
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:22,240
Oh,

1566
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:33,830
so it's two.

1567
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:34,570
Okay.

1568
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:38,890
So now it's one and...

1569
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:40,210
Okay.

1570
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:43,110
One is one.

1571
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:43,870
Two is one.

1572
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:44,010
It's not even.

1573
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:48,610
The one is a hint for Fujimi.

1574
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,900
Three and three.

1575
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,220
That was a good stride.

1576
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:28,560
Thanks.

1577
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:28,680
Thanks.

1578
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,000
Three and three.

1579
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:36,720
Looking at what he has too.

1580
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:37,200
Hmm.

1581
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:43,640
Yes, key talk on the membership.

1582
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:44,240
Thank you.

1583
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:47,740
Let's see.

1584
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,220
Three and three, right?

1585
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,980
I think I'm gonna kick out two of them with the beer.

1586
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,200
And then use the glasses.

1587
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:02,800
The magnifying glasses.

1588
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:12,100
The lower we have...

1589
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,820
It was three and three, right?

1590
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:14,600
Okay, that was a blank.

1591
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:16,380
It's three and three.

1592
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,080
Okay, now it's two and two.

1593
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,420
Now it's two and two.

1594
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,860
So let's do the phone first.

1595
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:29,840
I mean, it doesn't really matter.

1596
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,700
Okay, fourth shell is live.

1597
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:37,080
And now we'll know the whole image, basically.

1598
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:37,880
Almost.

1599
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:38,920
Oh, blank!

1600
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,640
Okay, okay, okay.

1601
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,080
So the fourth one was live, right?

1602
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,500
So let's do this on me.

1603
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:50,100
Okay.

1604
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:52,880
Now magnifying glass again.

1605
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:56,840
Blank!

1606
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,320
So the last two...

1607
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:00,420
Oh, shoot.

1608
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,340
There's no way that I can...

1609
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:05,900
There's no way I can avoid it.

1610
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,500
There's no way I can avoid it.

1611
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:07,720
No!

1612
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,780
And he's gonna get...

1613
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,060
He's gonna probably take down two.

1614
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:17,640
No!

1615
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,500
Love the TV model.

1616
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,160
Thank you!

1617
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:21,880
Thanks, B-E-C-R.

1618
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:22,680
Thank you so much.

1619
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,820
Maybe he'll take himself.

1620
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:25,680
True, true, true.

1621
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:25,840
Maybe.

1622
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:27,120
I don't think so, though.

1623
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,360
He'll probably use a magnifying glass.

1624
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:29,640
Or something.

1625
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:34,600
Sorry that the music sometimes gets a little crackly.

1626
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:35,340
I don't know why.

1627
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,220
I knew it!

1628
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,160
He's getting a snack.

1629
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:49,840
You jerk.

1630
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:00,110
Careful now.

1631
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:01,750
Careful...

1632
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,430
Why didn't he cough?

1633
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:09,250
That's a good question.

1634
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:12,790
Cause I will.

1635
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:15,630
Dan, thanks for the 20!

1636
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:16,710
Thank you so much.

1637
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:20,030
Uh, 3 live 4 blank.

1638
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:21,150
3 live 4 blank.

1639
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:21,870
3 live 4 blank.

1640
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:22,750
3 live 4 blank.

1641
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:23,490
Okay.

1642
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,580
You guys, I don't think I should take the 50-50 chance.

1643
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,060
Sorry.

1644
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:36,420
I shouldn't take the 50-50 chance, right?

1645
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,220
Six first?

1646
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,500
But it was only...

1647
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:49,300
I think...

1648
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:54,260
But two charges, but it only goes up to three.

1649
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,180
YOLO.

1650
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,160
I hate this afterlife!

1651
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:21,670
He never loses, but I always lose!

1652
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,350
Thank you for the 10.

1653
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:27,350
Thank you so much.

1654
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:36,250
I wish this was live.

1655
01:35:43,310 --> 01:35:45,130
Now it's three and three, right?

1656
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:46,350
I'm just gonna shoot him.

1657
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:47,890
I'm gonna die anyway.

1658
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:48,630
Just shoot!

1659
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,320
That's right.

1660
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:56,980
Shoot again!

1661
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:03,440
No way.

1662
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:07,660
Three blanks in a... No way.

1663
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,760
Two blanks in a row?

1664
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:19,280
It's over.

1665
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:29,100
Why can't I ever win the money?

1666
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:31,900
Why can't I ever win the money?

1667
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,260
I would have lived if it had...

1668
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,920
Oh wait, no, I wouldn't have lived because he did the knife too, didn't he?

1669
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,160
The disrespect of the sawed-off.

1670
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,000
I know, right?

1671
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,780
Such bad RNG.

1672
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:51,040
Okay.

1673
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,560
Third time's the charm, everybody.

1674
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:56,880
Third time's the charm.

1675
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,320
I'm feeling it.

1676
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:03,640
I'm feeling it.

1677
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:05,860
I'm feeling it!

1678
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,800
I'M FEELING IT!

1679
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:22,110
The system is down.

1680
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:23,710
The system is down.

1681
01:37:23,950 --> 01:37:25,370
The system is down.

1682
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:26,950
The system is down.

1683
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:38,510
Felt good.

1684
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:39,590
Please sign the waiver.

1685
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,370
I'm gonna pick someone from chat.

1686
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:48,470
Can win the money?

1687
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:49,190
Here, take mine.

1688
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:49,690
Okay.

1689
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:51,390
We'll name it after you, Blade.

1690
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,020
Thank you for your sacrifice.

1691
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,920
Welcome to the 73rd Hunger Games!

1692
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:05,860
You volunteered!

1693
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,980
They'll keep you alive, don't worry.

1694
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,520
We'll split the money like 30-70.

1695
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:19,760
Okay, Blade!

1696
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,020
You got this!

1697
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,860
Four and four.

1698
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,160
Look how happy he is.

1699
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:31,860
Four and four?

1700
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:48,360
No pressure, Blade.

1701
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:57,290
Rip, Blade.

1702
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:58,410
We barely knew you.

1703
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:00,950
Now it's three-four.

1704
01:39:08,590 --> 01:39:08,990
We best you.

1705
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:09,190
Uh -oh.

1706
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:10,710
It's super scary.

1707
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:11,310
Sorry, Quest.

1708
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:11,590
Uhhh...

1709
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:12,130
Will we order them?

1710
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:20,250
Um… I think I should just shoot again, but I wanna use the knife.

1711
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:20,630
No!

1712
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:21,410
It's not worth it.

1713
01:39:21,710 --> 01:39:22,510
He's gonna heal.

1714
01:39:25,690 --> 01:39:26,370
There it is.

1715
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:32,590
There it is.

1716
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:37,190
So now it's two and... wait, three and three, right?

1717
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:43,450
Very interesting!

1718
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:47,510
This guy, he kind of looks like a creepypasta version...

1719
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:47,690
Oh.

1720
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:53,310
He kind of looks like a creepypasta version of Jack Skellington.

1721
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:58,750
I used to watch that movie every day as a kid.

1722
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:05,830
So much so that my mom had to be like, Mint, you can't watch The Nightmare Before Christmas anymore.

1723
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:07,550
I'm sick of it.

1724
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:12,830
I ate the cigarette.

1725
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:15,050
So what?

1726
01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:15,790
It's now...

1727
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:20,290
Two live, three blank.

1728
01:40:20,530 --> 01:40:22,110
Yawn more, I'm trying to sleep.

1729
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:24,030
Why?

1730
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:25,630
You didn't even have to tell me.

1731
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,990
Unbelievably on brand.

1732
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:38,150
I literally would watch it every single day.

1733
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:42,610
I would watch Nightmare Before Christmas every day as a kid.

1734
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:47,770
My mom was like, There are other movies.

1735
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:49,050
Eventually...

1736
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:54,230
Eventually I cut it down to every other day.

1737
01:40:54,370 --> 01:41:00,090
And then every other day that wasn't Nightmare Before Christmas, I watched Alice in Wonderland.

1738
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:04,890
Oh no.

1739
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:10,250
But my sister also wanted to watch Alice in Wonderland with me.

1740
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:12,690
So we would watch it together every other day.

1741
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:15,710
And every other day then I'd watch Nightmare Before Christmas.

1742
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:18,510
Which version of Alice in Wonderland?

1743
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:21,490
The Disney animated one.

1744
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:26,640
Ouch.

1745
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:30,780
Okay, wait.

1746
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:31,260
What is it?

1747
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:32,380
Oh shoot.

1748
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,080
It's two live, three blank, right?

1749
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:41,120
Should I risk it for the biscuit?

1750
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:44,760
Oh!

1751
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:44,960
Oh!

1752
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:48,340
Two blank, two live!

1753
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,080
Hyper fixating from day one.

1754
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:56,060
Pretty much.

1755
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,720
He's got pills, but...

1756
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,640
I mean, I know he's gonna win it, but who cares.

1757
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,620
I've got nothing to lose.

1758
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,780
Only Blade has to lose.

1759
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:16,920
Uh oh.

1760
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:18,060
Now it's two live.

1761
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:20,260
One blank.

1762
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:29,430
Wait, now it's 50-50, right?

1763
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:30,190
Wait.

1764
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:31,310
Two...

1765
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:31,850
Wait!

1766
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:32,830
Now it's...

1767
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:33,790
Two live!

1768
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:34,950
Oh my gosh.

1769
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:38,310
So we're both gonna get hit.

1770
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:41,630
Idiot!

1771
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:45,110
What if he turns it on himself though?

1772
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:45,470
He could.

1773
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:47,790
The dealer doesn't always make a...

1774
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:49,110
great deal.

1775
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:53,750
50-50.

1776
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:54,670
50-50!

1777
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:54,870
Damn it!

1778
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:55,550
50-50!

1779
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:55,610
50-50!

1780
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:56,630
He lost!

1781
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:00,030
Dang it!

1782
01:43:00,410 --> 01:43:01,690
Why do you have to be smart?

1783
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:06,290
Okay.

1784
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:08,610
Wow, I can't believe he can actually lose the 50-50.

1785
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:12,850
It's only when I do it that I lose every time.

1786
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:15,330
Beer.

1787
01:43:16,510 --> 01:43:17,210
Magnifying glass.

1788
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:18,950
Polarizer.

1789
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:20,170
Nice.

1790
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:20,370
And a little...

1791
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:20,510
Okay.

1792
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,390
Alright.

1793
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:41,370
I should have used the beer first.

1794
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:42,390
I'm an idiot.

1795
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:43,130
But that's okay.

1796
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:46,170
That's okay.

1797
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:49,070
So the second one is blank, isn't it?

1798
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:51,110
And then... let's use the glass.

1799
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,840
Because if it's blank... Oh, it's live!

1800
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:32,580
The less bullets we have, you guys.

1801
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:33,520
He has handcuffs.

1802
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:34,880
The less bullets we have, the better.

1803
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:55,390
Yippee!

1804
01:44:55,390 --> 01:44:56,270
Good job, Blade!

1805
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:57,030
I told you!

1806
01:44:57,130 --> 01:44:57,650
I told you!

1807
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:04,930
See?

1808
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:07,830
I can brain sometimes.

1809
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:10,110
Nice.

1810
01:45:12,030 --> 01:45:13,550
What are we stealing, boys?

1811
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:16,530
Three and four.

1812
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:17,350
Okay.

1813
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:20,750
Wait, what's behind his beer?

1814
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:23,450
What's behind the beer?

1815
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:27,090
Guess we're gonna figure it out now.

1816
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:31,110
Oh, it's an adrenaline thingy!

1817
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:33,250
Yeah?

1818
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:36,470
Yes!

1819
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:36,990
Wow.

1820
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:43,550
It was, uh, four... It was three live and four blank, right?

1821
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:50,680
Now it's two fully.

1822
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:13,870
It's just one?

1823
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:15,370
No way.

1824
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,300
Oh my god.

1825
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:26,680
Don't do it.

1826
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:27,460
Oh my god!

1827
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:28,240
Oh my god!

1828
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:29,360
OH MY GAWD!

1829
01:46:45,870 --> 01:46:47,090
How many was that?

1830
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:47,810
Oh my gosh.

1831
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:48,110
Wait.

1832
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:49,890
Now you can't... You guys... You can't do it.

1833
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:51,670
You can't steal the adrenaline, so...

1834
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:54,030
He knows!

1835
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,410
The house always wins.

1836
01:46:56,690 --> 01:46:57,830
Three blanks in a row.

1837
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:58,770
I still messed up.

1838
01:46:59,070 --> 01:47:01,270
But this is still a blank.

1839
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:02,430
So it was two...

1840
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:04,330
I inverted one.

1841
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:07,230
Well, I... wait.

1842
01:47:07,450 --> 01:47:11,970
I can't

1843
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,180
keep track.

1844
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,540
Thanks guys for helping me.

1845
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,060
Nice!

1846
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:27,560
I wish I could steal his adrenaline though.

1847
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:31,440
Alright, let's get some more stuff.

1848
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:32,400
Some more goodies.

1849
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:33,280
Some beer.

1850
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:34,940
Some smokes.

1851
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,140
Wow, he's really...

1852
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:37,660
This is so hospitable.

1853
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,900
He's such a host.

1854
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,020
Medicine...

1855
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,600
Three live, four blank.

1856
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,060
Minto can't math.

1857
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:51,540
Not when it's like that!

1858
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,440
When I use the inverters...

1859
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,520
It makes me all...

1860
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,480
All fuzzy.

1861
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:00,460
We were at four health, so...

1862
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:03,540
I'm actually going to sm...

1863
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:04,420
Use it.

1864
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,220
I'm gonna have a little snack.

1865
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,660
Yeah, okay, good, good, good.

1866
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:09,620
Okay.

1867
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:12,420
It was three blank...

1868
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:12,920
No, sorry.

1869
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:14,400
Four blank, three live.

1870
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:19,500
Aha!

1871
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:23,600
No, I said the wrong thing.

1872
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:25,900
Wait, four blank.

1873
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,360
Now it's three...

1874
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,000
Now it's three-three.

1875
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:28,400
Whatever.

1876
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:29,180
It's three-three.

1877
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,220
Now it's three-three.

1878
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:35,080
I will cuff him.

1879
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:36,660
Just so I remember to do that.

1880
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:37,140
Yeah.

1881
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:38,700
Take that.

1882
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,500
And we're gonna take his...

1883
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:47,880
We're gonna take his magnifying glass.

1884
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:48,100
Nice.

1885
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:57,640
I don't know why I'm still shaking.

1886
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:59,160
I know what it is.

1887
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:00,880
So now it's three-two.

1888
01:49:10,570 --> 01:49:11,170
Uh-oh.

1889
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,280
Two-one, two-one, two-one.

1890
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:45,070
What the heck?

1891
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:46,490
I can't even use it.

1892
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:48,090
Oh, he is gonna use it.

1893
01:49:48,650 --> 01:49:49,730
Lose the fifty-fifty.

1894
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:50,490
Lose the fifty-fifty.

1895
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:51,430
Yes!

1896
01:49:51,570 --> 01:49:51,850
Yes!

1897
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:52,090
Yes!

1898
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:52,730
Nice!

1899
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:53,510
Nice!

1900
01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:53,810
Nice!

1901
01:49:53,810 --> 01:49:53,970
Nice!

1902
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:01,650
It's okay.

1903
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:01,990
It's okay.

1904
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:03,190
We still have three left.

1905
01:50:03,290 --> 01:50:03,930
We still have three left.

1906
01:50:04,050 --> 01:50:04,910
And then this one is the blank.

1907
01:50:05,150 --> 01:50:05,490
Oh, no.

1908
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:05,670
Wait.

1909
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:08,470
Actually...

1910
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:16,780
Now this one is the blank, isn't it?

1911
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,340
This one is the blank.

1912
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:23,720
Oh, Bruna!

1913
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:25,940
Thank you for the raid.

1914
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:26,820
Thank you.

1915
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:27,920
Thank you.

1916
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:28,200
Thank you.

1917
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:28,480
Thank you.

1918
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:28,740
Thank you.

1919
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:32,480
Hello!

1920
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:32,820
Hello!

1921
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:34,720
We're just gambling.

1922
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:39,640
We're fighting for one of my viewers lives.

1923
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:41,960
Who so graciously volunteered.

1924
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:43,420
Steal.

1925
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:43,840
Right back.

1926
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:44,820
Thank you for the five gifted!

1927
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:47,000
Alright.

1928
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:51,560
Two blank one live.

1929
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:51,880
Wow!

1930
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:52,900
Murphy!

1931
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:54,200
Thanks for the one live.

1932
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:55,800
Okay.

1933
01:50:57,740 --> 01:50:58,540
Okie-dokie.

1934
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:01,160
It was two blank, one live.

1935
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:14,960
Now this could either give us a 50-50 chance or...

1936
01:51:23,110 --> 01:51:26,230
I was hoping you would tell me where the live one was!

1937
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:31,270
But he's cuffed, so I can do both.

1938
01:51:31,370 --> 01:51:34,610
Actually, this kind of works because he only has one life left.

1939
01:51:34,610 --> 01:51:38,270
And we know that the first or the second are blank!

1940
01:51:38,490 --> 01:51:43,500
I mean, one's live and one's blank, so it's cuffed!

1941
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:44,320
Yeah!

1942
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:57,840
Three...

1943
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:05,310
Oh my gosh.

1944
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:06,350
Medicine.

1945
01:52:07,010 --> 01:52:07,610
Cuffs.

1946
01:52:08,450 --> 01:52:09,050
Phone.

1947
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:10,810
Smokes.

1948
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:14,730
Two?

1949
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:19,850
Four blank, three live.

1950
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:20,930
Oh gosh.

1951
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:41,330
I hate this stupid-ass phone.

1952
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:43,050
No wonder I break it every time!

1953
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:46,770
The seventh is alive!

1954
01:52:49,890 --> 01:52:50,910
So, ok.

1955
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:52,950
So that means...

1956
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:53,890
Oh gosh.

1957
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:56,170
Two, four.

1958
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:56,810
Yeah.

1959
01:52:57,790 --> 01:52:59,550
So might as well...

1960
01:53:00,370 --> 01:53:01,390
Ok, this is one.

1961
01:53:03,150 --> 01:53:03,750
Oh!

1962
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:39,340
I think we're in trouble.

1963
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,240
The sixth...

1964
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:42,700
No, you guys!

1965
01:53:42,740 --> 01:53:43,480
I can't...

1966
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:44,600
It won't give me any more!

1967
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:46,420
We only have two lives each!

1968
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,140
He got rid of one of the live!

1969
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,260
Oh gosh.

1970
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:07,660
I don't know how many we're at.

1971
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:07,780
We got...

1972
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:10,000
No!

1973
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:12,720
I think...

1974
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:17,960
Blade.

1975
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,320
Blade, we got Blade.

1976
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:24,420
Blade, we got Blade!

1977
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:25,820
How did he...

1978
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:26,600
No!

1979
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:31,900
Blade!

1980
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:36,560
No, Blade!

1981
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:36,960
Blade!

1982
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:40,720
Blade is a ghost now.

1983
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,300
Blade...

1984
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:43,700
is a wisp.

1985
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:44,080
Real.

1986
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:45,560
Next viewer.

1987
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:47,960
Alright.

1988
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:51,900
Rip Blade.

1989
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:03,420
The

1990
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:15,320
system is down.

1991
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:16,740
The system is down.

1992
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:18,640
Please sign the waiver.

1993
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:18,940
Ok.

1994
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,020
Made Blade.

1995
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,020
Oh, Shady!

1996
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:24,240
What perfect timing.

1997
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:32,460
Thank you.

1998
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:36,260
Welcome everybody to the 74th Hunger Games!

1999
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,200
Ok.

2000
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:45,980
What do we got?

2001
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:48,340
A little knife, a little beer.

2002
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:49,840
A second beer.

2003
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:51,520
Some handcuffs.

2004
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:54,920
Don't drink and have a knife at the same time!

2005
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:58,180
The real Shady.

2006
01:55:58,500 --> 01:55:59,680
3 and 3, baby.

2007
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:13,880
3 and 2, baby.

2008
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,020
Two and two, baby!

2009
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:24,480
Haven't seen a maid take those many buck shots since I cleared my brow.

2010
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:35,670
Jail.

2011
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:38,190
That's you.

2012
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:43,640
You know what?

2013
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:44,560
This one's also for you.

2014
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,820
Do we risk it for the biscuit?

2015
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:07,880
Or...

2016
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:14,000
It's one life, two blank.

2017
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:23,700
Risk it?

2018
01:57:27,890 --> 01:57:29,010
I don't think you can win.

2019
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:30,210
The odds have not been in your favor.

2020
01:57:32,130 --> 01:57:32,530
Favor.

2021
01:57:42,730 --> 01:57:43,570
Oh, shoot!

2022
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:45,670
I thought he had one more...

2023
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:47,230
Oops.

2024
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:54,350
I thought he had a...

2025
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:55,970
I had a... I thought...

2026
01:57:58,050 --> 01:57:59,410
My bad.

2027
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:06,570
Three and four.

2028
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:15,410
I smile.

2029
01:58:15,850 --> 01:58:16,530
Nope.

2030
01:58:16,630 --> 01:58:17,050
Nope.

2031
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:17,450
No!

2032
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:18,310
What?

2033
01:58:18,430 --> 01:58:19,590
What did I just eject?

2034
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:21,770
No, no, no, no, no!

2035
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:22,610
You!

2036
01:58:24,350 --> 01:58:24,830
You!

2037
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:25,750
You!

2038
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:26,550
You!

2039
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:27,150
You!

2040
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:31,690
First of all, you'll ask something like this?

2041
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:38,050
Why are you coming to look

2042
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:57,460
at me, you moron?

2043
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:00,200
What's wrong?

2044
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:01,340
All right.

2045
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,620
You'll never get me.

2046
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:08,760
You'll never...

2047
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:10,080
You'll never...

2048
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,380
You will nev...

2049
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:13,900
You...

2050
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:15,460
will never...

2051
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:16,440
ever...

2052
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,500
ever...

2053
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,360
ever...

2054
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,340
ever...

2055
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:19,880
EVER!

2056
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:23,720
EVER EVER EVER EVER GET ME!

2057
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:30,080
I will not let you have that victory.

2058
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:34,180
I will not let you...

2059
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:36,180
have...

2060
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:37,800
me ever...

2061
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:38,280
You...

2062
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:40,400
You will never be able to brag...

2063
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:41,340
about that...

2064
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:41,900
ever...

2065
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:42,520
You will...

2066
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:43,000
You...

2067
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,120
You will never catch me...

2068
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:47,300
saying your name!

2069
01:59:48,620 --> 01:59:49,420
EVER!

2070
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:10,880
Got your nose...

2071
02:00:24,340 --> 02:00:24,820
Okay.

2072
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:30,200
Okay.

2073
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:31,460
You're just like...

2074
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:32,920
Challenge accepted.

2075
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:40,320
Thanks ICE!

2076
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,640
I'm completely lost in the sauce.

2077
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:52,340
I have no idea where we're at.

2078
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:53,320
Oh 3-3!

2079
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:00,060
Thank you for the 10.

2080
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:01,680
So now it's...

2081
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:03,420
2...

2082
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:05,440
Live 3 blank.

2083
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:05,900
Right?

2084
02:01:15,650 --> 02:01:16,830
Give it to me.

2085
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:20,610
It hurts so good!

2086
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:31,000
I hate this damn phone.

2087
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:41,320
Should have stolen the cuffs.

2088
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:42,280
That's fine.

2089
02:01:47,910 --> 02:01:49,330
It's fine.

2090
02:01:58,030 --> 02:01:59,210
Okay.

2091
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:02,510
Sure.

2092
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:08,850
You...

2093
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:09,470
You...

2094
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:10,110
Asshole!

2095
02:02:10,110 --> 02:02:10,470
You!

2096
02:02:29,790 --> 02:02:31,650
Thank you Shady for your sacrifice.

2097
02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:33,170
Yeah.

2098
02:02:33,190 --> 02:02:34,010
We got outplayed.

2099
02:02:34,010 --> 02:02:35,050
That was my bad.

2100
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:36,830
I should have grabbed the cuffs.

2101
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:37,850
Sorry Shady.

2102
02:02:37,870 --> 02:02:38,330
I killed you.

2103
02:02:40,970 --> 02:02:42,270
Oh my god.

2104
02:02:42,810 --> 02:02:44,370
What's wrong with you guys today?

2105
02:02:44,650 --> 02:02:48,510
I'm gone for like 3 days and you all become craziness.

2106
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:52,070
Maybe we're taking too many pills.

2107
02:02:52,890 --> 02:02:55,890
Or maybe you need to take the pills.

2108
02:02:56,050 --> 02:02:56,910
I don't know anymore.

2109
02:02:58,030 --> 02:02:59,470
Please sign the waiver.

2110
02:03:00,590 --> 02:03:02,030
Thanks for the pink though.

2111
02:03:02,210 --> 02:03:04,630
I think we missed you.

2112
02:03:05,390 --> 02:03:06,510
All righty.

2113
02:03:06,510 --> 02:03:07,210
Who am I?

2114
02:03:07,310 --> 02:03:08,470
Oh star creator.

2115
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:09,450
How perfect.

2116
02:03:10,510 --> 02:03:13,350
I'd volunteer as trivia but my name doesn't fit.

2117
02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:15,850
No problem.

2118
02:03:15,930 --> 02:03:17,330
10 out of 10 would be me shielding.

2119
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:19,210
Let's see.

2120
02:03:19,210 --> 02:03:20,550
I think we can make it fit.

2121
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:04,200
Bing!

2122
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:06,340
Two and two, baby!

2123
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:16,820
Not really much talent here.

2124
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,860
It's really just...

2125
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:20,900
It's just...

2126
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:29,090
I appreciate not seeming so weird in comparison.

2127
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:37,060
There's always gonna be someone weirder than you out there.

2128
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:37,400
You know?

2129
02:04:38,300 --> 02:04:40,120
Fair game of roulette, truly.

2130
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,120
Alright, let's eat it.

2131
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:47,800
We really ate it.

2132
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:49,220
We really ate it!

2133
02:04:57,180 --> 02:04:57,640
Oh.

2134
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:00,640
What are you doing to that?

2135
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:01,440
What do you mean by that?

2136
02:05:03,220 --> 02:05:04,580
Wait, what are you doing by that?

2137
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:05,400
Ah!

2138
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:14,890
Ugh.

2139
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:26,480
So now it's...

2140
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:27,800
Wait, hold on.

2141
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:28,720
What was it?

2142
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:29,280
Two and two?

2143
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:30,600
And then I ate one.

2144
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:32,180
And then...

2145
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:35,440
I got shot.

2146
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,160
Oh, it's two blanks?

2147
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:42,680
No, it's not.

2148
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:43,320
I don't think it's...

2149
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:44,700
I don't think it's two blanks.

2150
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:44,900
Wait.

2151
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:46,300
He inverted one.

2152
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:50,380
He inverted a blank.

2153
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:52,220
Yes.

2154
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:54,580
So now it's one-one, right?

2155
02:05:58,920 --> 02:05:59,820
It's one-one.

2156
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:14,250
Ready to chance that 50-50?

2157
02:06:20,950 --> 02:06:22,250
I think I'm going to eat it.

2158
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:25,870
Because regardless, I'll get the next shot in, right?

2159
02:06:26,150 --> 02:06:27,510
If I eat the shot...

2160
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:27,650
Wait.

2161
02:06:28,610 --> 02:06:29,170
Oh, wait.

2162
02:06:29,210 --> 02:06:31,050
Shooting yourself with a blank skips the dealer's turn.

2163
02:06:31,230 --> 02:06:31,510
Oh.

2164
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:34,410
Um...

2165
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:36,910
Oh!

2166
02:06:39,570 --> 02:06:40,370
Oh, gosh!

2167
02:06:40,510 --> 02:06:41,230
I'm scared!

2168
02:06:44,110 --> 02:06:46,970
If you invert, you will either do damage or he won't do damage.

2169
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:48,850
If you invert, you will either do damage or he won't do damage.

2170
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:48,910
True.

2171
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:49,010
True.

2172
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:52,490
True, true, true, true.

2173
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:03,230
On himself.

2174
02:07:08,410 --> 02:07:11,830
Well, that was ended a little anticlimactically now, didn't it?

2175
02:07:12,530 --> 02:07:13,070
Well, that was ended a little anticlimactically now, didn't it?

2176
02:07:15,350 --> 02:07:15,830
More?

2177
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:17,150
Nice.

2178
02:07:19,770 --> 02:07:20,650
Two and three!

2179
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:53,660
Three!

2180
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:54,340
Take that!

2181
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:55,020
And that!

2182
02:07:55,180 --> 02:07:55,820
And that!

2183
02:07:56,100 --> 02:08:00,880
And I'm going to take a little smoke break.

2184
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:02,200
A little snack break.

2185
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:03,500
Pass the mic!

2186
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:05,920
Welcome to Bamboo Ship Langu!

2187
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:07,900
And...

2188
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:10,160
There you go.

2189
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:14,960
Now it's one to three.

2190
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:15,500
Now it's one to three.

2191
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,500
You okay, buddy?

2192
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:34,540
We're going to risk it.

2193
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,040
We're going to risk it.

2194
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:39,200
We're going to risk it.

2195
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:40,340
Ah!

2196
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:45,600
Two...

2197
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:47,700
One live, two blank.

2198
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:48,520
Oh, gosh.

2199
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:50,400
Oh, gosh.

2200
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:50,660
Wait.

2201
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:51,660
He might risk it too.

2202
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:52,920
Ah!

2203
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:56,020
Ah!

2204
02:08:56,020 --> 02:08:56,220
Ah!

2205
02:08:59,380 --> 02:08:59,820
Wait.

2206
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:01,540
He's probably going to steal my pills.

2207
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:04,520
He's going to steal my pill.

2208
02:09:04,780 --> 02:09:05,220
Probably.

2209
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:07,040
Wait.

2210
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:07,940
Why are you doing that?

2211
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:10,080
You just saw what was in there.

2212
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:12,760
Oh.

2213
02:09:15,320 --> 02:09:15,760
Oh.

2214
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:19,300
Oh.

2215
02:09:19,980 --> 02:09:20,340
Oh.

2216
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:21,180
Oh.

2217
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:28,480
Now it's blank, didn't you?

2218
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:33,780
But it's blank, though.

2219
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:34,620
Why didn't you...

2220
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:36,720
Okay.

2221
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:41,620
Now it's out.

2222
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:45,260
Give me stuff.

2223
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:45,960
Give me stuff.

2224
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:47,720
Smokes.

2225
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:48,440
Magnifying glass.

2226
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:49,240
Oh, that's it?

2227
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:49,560
Okay.

2228
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:49,700
Okay.

2229
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,280
He got two magnifying glasses!

2230
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:53,540
Two and two!

2231
02:09:58,640 --> 02:09:59,080
But...

2232
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:02,700
Two and two.

2233
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:04,660
I'm gonna smoke just in case.

2234
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:09,640
Bing!

2235
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:10,920
And I'm going to...

2236
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,400
Let's see what it is.

2237
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:15,700
Blank.

2238
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:23,020
Okay, we're just gonna have to...

2239
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:24,460
We're gonna have to hope, you guys.

2240
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:25,220
We're gonna have to hope.

2241
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:33,030
Shoot, I should have used the meds.

2242
02:10:35,550 --> 02:10:36,270
Never mind!

2243
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:37,130
Yippee!

2244
02:10:40,910 --> 02:10:41,850
Sixty-six percentage!

2245
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:42,930
It's not good!

2246
02:10:42,990 --> 02:10:44,230
It's not high enough for me!

2247
02:10:45,970 --> 02:10:46,810
Good job, Star Creator.

2248
02:10:48,190 --> 02:10:48,850
Second round.

2249
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:07,960
Two and two.

2250
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:25,630
Two and one.

2251
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:40,650
Second shell live.

2252
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:41,870
Okay.

2253
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:00,680
So this is... Wait.

2254
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:01,220
Oh, wait.

2255
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:02,260
Actually, I'm confused.

2256
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,960
When I use the beer, does it...

2257
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:08,840
Or rather, when I use the phone, does it count... Would this be the second one, then?

2258
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:10,120
Right?

2259
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:11,440
So this is the second one.

2260
02:12:16,820 --> 02:12:17,260
What?!

2261
02:12:19,640 --> 02:12:20,080
Wait!

2262
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:22,960
It's not!

2263
02:12:24,940 --> 02:12:26,620
It counts from your current round!

2264
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:29,580
Oh my god!

2265
02:12:30,980 --> 02:12:32,040
Oh my god!

2266
02:12:33,100 --> 02:12:37,650
Well, that was a good exper... At least we know now.

2267
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:40,650
Good to exp... Oh, shoot.

2268
02:12:43,310 --> 02:12:43,950
Uh-oh.

2269
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:50,510
What are you stealing?

2270
02:12:50,790 --> 02:12:51,310
No!

2271
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,020
My Yoshi can't count.

2272
02:12:58,060 --> 02:12:58,720
What are you talking about?

2273
02:12:58,800 --> 02:12:59,900
It has nothing to do with counting!

2274
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:03,740
Oh...

2275
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:13,000
But now, this one is blank.

2276
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:15,640
It was two and two, right?

2277
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:17,040
Oh, wait.

2278
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:17,520
Never mind.

2279
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:18,060
It was empty.

2280
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:18,100
Oh, wait.

2281
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:18,100
Never mind.

2282
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:18,140
It was empty.

2283
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:21,300
Oh!

2284
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:23,280
What?

2285
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:25,340
Oh...

2286
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:29,640
Three live, four blank.

2287
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:30,400
Three live, four blank.

2288
02:13:30,980 --> 02:13:32,280
How about that counting?

2289
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:33,560
Shut up.

2290
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:35,780
Okay.

2291
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:43,110
I wish I had handcuffs, though.

2292
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:46,730
Yeah, let's steal the glass.

2293
02:13:50,450 --> 02:13:52,910
Even though he could steal it right back if he wanted to.

2294
02:13:53,590 --> 02:13:54,230
Actually, no!

2295
02:13:54,790 --> 02:13:55,230
Wait.

2296
02:13:55,810 --> 02:13:56,250
Sorry.

2297
02:13:59,070 --> 02:14:00,970
I can have handcuffs if I want to!

2298
02:14:26,360 --> 02:14:28,620
Now, it's three and three, right?

2299
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:32,640
Three and three?

2300
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:40,500
Now, I'm gonna steal his glass.

2301
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:50,560
I was like... I was like, I'm gonna steal his...

2302
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:51,040
Oh, it's live!

2303
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:52,760
I was like, I'm gonna steal his glass!

2304
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,800
And then I was like, wait a second.

2305
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:55,620
No, he has handcuffs!

2306
02:14:56,740 --> 02:14:58,080
Shoot, baby, shoot!

2307
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:03,360
Okay.

2308
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:10,260
Interesting.

2309
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:18,400
What's he gonna do?

2310
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:26,420
Careful now!

2311
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:34,400
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

2312
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,360
I'll be honest.

2313
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:38,040
Star Creator, I'm sorry.

2314
02:15:41,060 --> 02:15:42,880
I don't think we're gonna make it.

2315
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:49,420
I don't think we're gonna make it, man.

2316
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:50,460
Wait a second.

2317
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:52,980
I can just get rid of all of these.

2318
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:59,100
I can just get rid of all of these, can't I?

2319
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,340
Then maybe we can get a health item.

2320
02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:06,750
Because we'll get through the rest of the bullets.

2321
02:16:17,380 --> 02:16:17,880
There we go.

2322
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:20,840
Knife.

2323
02:16:22,060 --> 02:16:22,340
Cigarettes.

2324
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:23,960
Cigarettes, please.

2325
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:26,500
Cigarettes, please!

2326
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:33,040
Okay,

2327
02:16:38,970 --> 02:16:39,930
how do I wanna play this?

2328
02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:41,670
Okay, wait, hold on!

2329
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:43,830
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

2330
02:16:45,970 --> 02:16:47,630
I have an idea, I have an idea, I have an idea.

2331
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:51,670
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2332
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:52,430
I'm strategizing.

2333
02:16:52,590 --> 02:16:57,450
I'm gonna, I'm going to try and explain my thought process.

2334
02:16:57,930 --> 02:17:00,570
I'm not looking at chat because it distracts me.

2335
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:01,390
Wait, hold on.

2336
02:17:01,410 --> 02:17:02,130
I don't wanna lose my thought.

2337
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:03,090
I don't wanna lose my train of thought!

2338
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:05,390
If I...

2339
02:17:07,850 --> 02:17:08,490
beer it...

2340
02:17:10,850 --> 02:17:12,250
and get rid of one...

2341
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:17,600
and see what it is...

2342
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:19,560
and then I...

2343
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:22,440
depending.

2344
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:24,540
You know, if it's...

2345
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:25,960
if we get rid of the blank...

2346
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:27,280
and for the live...

2347
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:28,920
we could just...

2348
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:30,360
saw it...

2349
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:31,660
and then...

2350
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:34,060
and then...

2351
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:35,080
kill him.

2352
02:17:35,220 --> 02:17:37,360
But if it's the blank...

2353
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:38,580
I can steal his...

2354
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:39,220
his...

2355
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:41,740
polarizer and then make it live...

2356
02:17:41,740 --> 02:17:42,540
and then...

2357
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:43,360
kill him.

2358
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:44,840
So, either way...

2359
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:48,420
either way...

2360
02:17:52,310 --> 02:17:52,730
it works.

2361
02:17:54,690 --> 02:17:56,190
Why does she over-complicate things?

2362
02:17:56,250 --> 02:17:57,010
Why are you rude?

2363
02:17:59,330 --> 02:18:00,790
Wait, what did I just get rid of?

2364
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:02,070
God damn it!

2365
02:18:02,110 --> 02:18:02,390
You know what?

2366
02:18:02,430 --> 02:18:03,330
Fuck you, man!

2367
02:18:04,170 --> 02:18:05,570
Don't be mean to me like that!

2368
02:18:05,810 --> 02:18:07,070
Why can't I have my own...

2369
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:08,430
my own thought process?

2370
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:18,240
I got rid of the blank?

2371
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:18,840
Oh, okay.

2372
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:19,620
Thanks, guys.

2373
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:26,860
It wasn't over-complicating.

2374
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:33,440
It's just a different way of thinking.

2375
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:55,260
That's it.

2376
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:57,360
Actually, those are two really good ones to get.

2377
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:58,240
I think.

2378
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:01,060
Three and three.

2379
02:19:14,050 --> 02:19:15,370
I'm just gonna use both of them.

2380
02:19:15,530 --> 02:19:15,890
Honestly.

2381
02:19:18,730 --> 02:19:19,090
Cool.

2382
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:27,560
Two, three.

2383
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:28,480
Two, three.

2384
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:28,780
Two, three.

2385
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:28,940
Two, three.

2386
02:19:37,630 --> 02:19:39,510
Might as well.

2387
02:19:39,530 --> 02:19:41,130
You're doing great using that big noggin of yours.

2388
02:19:41,250 --> 02:19:41,850
Thanks, turtles.

2389
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:43,710
Thank you.

2390
02:19:43,770 --> 02:19:44,130
Sorry.

2391
02:19:44,210 --> 02:19:46,450
I'm a little sensitive today because I'm not feeling so well.

2392
02:19:53,730 --> 02:19:54,790
Might as well.

2393
02:19:58,950 --> 02:20:00,710
Now it's one, three.

2394
02:20:01,410 --> 02:20:01,850
So...

2395
02:20:04,370 --> 02:20:05,730
What are you gonna do, mister?

2396
02:20:13,330 --> 02:20:13,850
Now...

2397
02:20:13,850 --> 02:20:14,570
One, two.

2398
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:16,230
Oh, he's got a chest?

2399
02:20:16,630 --> 02:20:18,170
Uh-oh.

2400
02:20:18,350 --> 02:20:18,850
No!

2401
02:20:19,690 --> 02:20:20,690
Not on me!

2402
02:20:23,710 --> 02:20:24,630
You jerk!

2403
02:20:30,130 --> 02:20:31,350
Give me the...

2404
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:31,890
Wait.

2405
02:20:34,090 --> 02:20:34,810
Oh, wait.

2406
02:20:34,990 --> 02:20:38,550
Oh, it's just a black...

2407
02:20:38,550 --> 02:20:38,750
Wait.

2408
02:20:40,830 --> 02:20:41,790
I thought he...

2409
02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:43,150
I thought he did the last one.

2410
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:56,980
Two and two.

2411
02:20:58,300 --> 02:20:59,220
Oh, he bearded.

2412
02:20:59,220 --> 02:20:59,500
That's right.

2413
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:04,360
Two and two.

2414
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:14,160
Now that we know that it's of our...

2415
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:15,180
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

2416
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:16,600
One and two.

2417
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:20,460
Now that we know that the phone works for our current round, this will help, you know?

2418
02:21:23,220 --> 02:21:24,260
Third shell blank.

2419
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:37,100
Otherwise...

2420
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:37,860
I'm dead otherwise.

2421
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:39,380
If I don't use this.

2422
02:21:44,130 --> 02:21:45,350
Come on, 50-50!

2423
02:21:47,110 --> 02:21:49,450
Oh, wait!

2424
02:21:51,250 --> 02:21:52,130
It worked!

2425
02:21:58,940 --> 02:21:59,720
Let's try it.

2426
02:22:07,220 --> 02:22:08,600
You don't... what are you, dumb?

2427
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:09,700
You don't even need to look!

2428
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:17,400
But it's a good thing that I took the medicine.

2429
02:22:18,140 --> 02:22:19,600
It's a good thing I took the medicine.

2430
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,120
You... asshole!

2431
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:38,800
And this is the one that's a blank, right?

2432
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:42,960
This is the blank one.

2433
02:22:58,670 --> 02:22:59,790
Oh my goodness!

2434
02:23:00,350 --> 02:23:01,290
Four and four?

2435
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:16,580
I don't know...

2436
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:20,060
Yeah, I think I'm gonna steal the cups.

2437
02:23:20,060 --> 02:23:20,480
I think I'm gonna steal the cups.

2438
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:25,000
I hear everything.

2439
02:23:36,830 --> 02:23:38,090
Four and four...

2440
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:49,380
Wondering if I should polarize... like if I should invert some... one of them, you know?

2441
02:23:49,860 --> 02:23:51,260
I don't know...

2442
02:23:54,920 --> 02:23:56,420
I'll start praying.

2443
02:24:07,790 --> 02:24:08,430
Nice!

2444
02:24:08,450 --> 02:24:09,010
Nice!

2445
02:24:09,130 --> 02:24:09,450
Nice!

2446
02:24:11,810 --> 02:24:12,870
You got this, Mint.

2447
02:24:12,910 --> 02:24:14,570
Show them what a true gambler can do.

2448
02:24:16,350 --> 02:24:16,990
Okay!

2449
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:21,590
Now, I'm going to invert it.

2450
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:27,820
I'm scared!

2451
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:29,660
Just go!

2452
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:35,020
Star Creator, you lucky bastard!

2453
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:39,880
Yippee!

2454
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:46,380
Ten dollars!

2455
02:24:46,660 --> 02:24:47,820
Double or nothing!

2456
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:55,820
Five bucks to put on the horses.

2457
02:25:01,810 --> 02:25:04,530
I didn't even realize there was money down here until...

2458
02:25:11,260 --> 02:25:12,720
We're always double or nothing.

2459
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:17,820
We're always double or nothing.

2460
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:20,540
Wait, he still gets to keep his phone?

2461
02:25:20,660 --> 02:25:21,460
That's messed up.

2462
02:25:23,380 --> 02:25:24,880
That's actually kind of messed up.

2463
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Three live, four blank.

2464
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,400
Oh, he has... he has...

2465
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:41,140
He has two...

2466
02:25:41,140 --> 02:25:42,920
Three live, four blank.

2467
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:48,920
Two live, four blank.

2468
02:25:55,550 --> 02:25:57,190
Two live, three blank.

2469
02:26:02,070 --> 02:26:05,870
He can really... he can hurt me really badly with what he's got.

2470
02:26:06,250 --> 02:26:07,150
I'm kind of scared.

2471
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:09,150
I'm kind of scared.

2472
02:26:10,870 --> 02:26:11,410
Oh!

2473
02:26:16,210 --> 02:26:18,930
He doesn't have any health, so I will take it.

2474
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:25,950
Otherwise, I was thinking of maybe, possibly...

2475
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:28,970
Inverting it and using it on myself.

2476
02:26:30,970 --> 02:26:32,970
This too was deal or no deal.

2477
02:26:35,710 --> 02:26:36,910
What are you taking?

2478
02:26:38,010 --> 02:26:38,430
No!

2479
02:26:40,130 --> 02:26:40,730
Uh-oh.

2480
02:26:42,770 --> 02:26:44,150
So it was a blank, huh?

2481
02:26:44,530 --> 02:26:44,950
Wait...

2482
02:26:46,370 --> 02:26:48,550
I hate his... I hate this guy.

2483
02:26:48,690 --> 02:26:50,650
I hate this guy so much!

2484
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:02,610
So that was also a blank.

2485
02:27:03,730 --> 02:27:05,430
Turn... so now it's two and...

2486
02:27:06,850 --> 02:27:07,710
Two, right?

2487
02:27:41,730 --> 02:27:42,630
I knew it.

2488
02:27:42,630 --> 02:27:43,490
I knew it.

2489
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:44,090
I knew.

2490
02:27:44,190 --> 02:27:44,730
I knew.

2491
02:27:44,850 --> 02:27:45,730
I knew.

2492
02:27:45,870 --> 02:27:46,810
I knew.

2493
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:56,530
The house is cheating!

2494
02:27:57,370 --> 02:27:58,710
The house is cheating!

2495
02:28:07,190 --> 02:28:07,730
Sorry.

2496
02:28:09,430 --> 02:28:10,390
What is that?

2497
02:28:10,610 --> 02:28:11,250
Trash can?

2498
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:13,910
No, we're not throwing out your body.

2499
02:28:14,730 --> 02:28:16,750
Why would we throw you out?

2500
02:28:18,610 --> 02:28:19,190
Thanks for the raid!

2501
02:28:19,450 --> 02:28:19,930
Oh!

2502
02:28:19,930 --> 02:28:20,250
Dizzy!

2503
02:28:20,750 --> 02:28:21,810
Thanks for the raid!

2504
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:23,930
Oh...

2505
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:26,910
I did not just lose.

2506
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:30,190
One of my viewers, Stark Creator, just lost.

2507
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:36,350
Oh, it was an urn!

2508
02:28:42,470 --> 02:28:43,850
But you got to the end.

2509
02:28:44,490 --> 02:28:45,830
You made it.

2510
02:28:45,850 --> 02:28:47,250
Verily, thanks for the five-gifted.

2511
02:28:49,030 --> 02:28:52,770
Imagine the last thing you show before you die being the house is cheating.

2512
02:28:54,530 --> 02:28:55,330
Okay, guys.

2513
02:28:55,350 --> 02:28:56,670
Thank you for the five-gifted.

2514
02:28:57,070 --> 02:28:57,550
Yeah.

2515
02:28:58,090 --> 02:28:59,910
What is Mint doing in a dirty restroom?

2516
02:29:00,050 --> 02:29:00,250
You know.

2517
02:29:01,190 --> 02:29:02,090
Dirty things.

2518
02:29:03,130 --> 02:29:04,350
I'm Dirty Dan.

2519
02:29:04,850 --> 02:29:05,490
You know.

2520
02:29:06,950 --> 02:29:08,310
I haunt this.

2521
02:29:09,310 --> 02:29:11,150
This is the maid cafe, actually.

2522
02:29:11,270 --> 02:29:12,090
This is...

2523
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:15,230
I'm taking pills.

2524
02:29:16,550 --> 02:29:17,410
Here we go.

2525
02:29:17,450 --> 02:29:17,770
Here we go.

2526
02:29:18,210 --> 02:29:19,930
Are you guys ready to feel it?

2527
02:29:20,850 --> 02:29:22,590
Are you ready to feel it?

2528
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:30,790
I think I'm...

2529
02:29:32,150 --> 02:29:33,390
I'm feeling it!

2530
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:40,760
Let's go!

2531
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:51,020
Sign the waiver.

2532
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:52,460
I'll sign anything.

2533
02:29:52,460 --> 02:29:53,000
I'll sign anything!

2534
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,020
I'll sign anything you give me!

2535
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:55,280
I'll do it!

2536
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:55,820
I'll do it!

2537
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:56,400
I'll do it!

2538
02:29:56,420 --> 02:29:56,980
I'll do it!

2539
02:29:57,960 --> 02:29:59,800
Thank you for the five gifted!

2540
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:00,940
Hold on, who else?

2541
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:04,600
Johnny, thanks for the five gifted!

2542
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,180
Thanks for the five gifted!

2543
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:09,240
Oh, thanks for the five!

2544
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:10,820
Thank you guys!

2545
02:30:11,060 --> 02:30:11,520
Thank you!

2546
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:13,240
Karma strikes!

2547
02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:22,770
Wait...

2548
02:30:23,370 --> 02:30:24,710
I hope I spelled your name right.

2549
02:30:29,410 --> 02:30:31,950
Here's some spending money, don't blow your brains out!

2550
02:30:41,050 --> 02:30:42,570
Here we go, baby!

2551
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:47,740
Two and two!

2552
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:56,640
Two and two, okay.

2553
02:30:56,760 --> 02:30:57,140
Alright.

2554
02:30:57,140 --> 02:31:00,140
I'm going to steal their cuffs.

2555
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:11,780
Yoink!

2556
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:14,200
And I'm going to check the phone.

2557
02:31:16,980 --> 02:31:18,520
Fourth shell blank!

2558
02:31:19,420 --> 02:31:20,880
You don't say.

2559
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:21,300
You don't say.

2560
02:31:31,580 --> 02:31:33,260
Fourth shell blank.

2561
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:40,420
I'm just going to shoot.

2562
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:47,000
Let's go!

2563
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:49,820
And...

2564
02:31:53,330 --> 02:31:55,110
Now it's 50-50.

2565
02:31:58,110 --> 02:32:01,250
I don't want him to steal my polarizer, so I'm...

2566
02:32:03,230 --> 02:32:04,290
I'm going to use it!

2567
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:12,260
Yeah!

2568
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:16,080
Uh-oh, wait.

2569
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:19,260
Now it's one live and one blank.

2570
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:19,920
Okay, wait.

2571
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:22,220
He just got rid of the live one!

2572
02:32:22,380 --> 02:32:22,840
Yes!

2573
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:23,700
Now it's blank!

2574
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,020
He doesn't know that.

2575
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:26,580
Oh, yes, he does.

2576
02:32:34,480 --> 02:32:34,840
Nice!

2577
02:32:35,620 --> 02:32:35,980
Knife?

2578
02:32:36,840 --> 02:32:37,200
Nice!

2579
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:38,460
Knife!

2580
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:39,860
Knife!

2581
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:40,560
Okay.

2582
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:45,760
Three live, four blank.

2583
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:46,860
Three live, four blank.

2584
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:48,940
Of course he knows he's cheating.

2585
02:32:49,140 --> 02:32:49,620
I know, right?

2586
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:02,960
What was it?

2587
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:05,440
Three live, four blank.

2588
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:06,680
Okay.

2589
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:09,500
What do I want to steal?

2590
02:33:12,940 --> 02:33:16,160
I have handcuffs, but he does not.

2591
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:27,040
Yes!

2592
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:30,940
Steal the glass!

2593
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:35,680
Blank!

2594
02:33:36,980 --> 02:33:37,620
Uh...

2595
02:33:37,880 --> 02:33:38,440
Okay, it's blank.

2596
02:33:56,410 --> 02:33:57,690
Since I have...

2597
02:33:58,290 --> 02:34:00,910
I was going to say since I have two, but he only has one live.

2598
02:34:04,450 --> 02:34:05,370
Wait, what is it now?

2599
02:34:05,630 --> 02:34:06,830
So it's three-three now.

2600
02:34:08,570 --> 02:34:09,210
Two live...

2601
02:34:10,090 --> 02:34:10,410
Yeah.

2602
02:34:11,310 --> 02:34:12,390
No, it's three live, four blank.

2603
02:34:12,410 --> 02:34:12,670
Yeah.

2604
02:34:12,690 --> 02:34:13,610
And so now it's three-three.

2605
02:34:15,910 --> 02:34:16,430
Um...

2606
02:34:19,190 --> 02:34:21,930
I'm trying to think if I should steal his beer or not.

2607
02:34:24,290 --> 02:34:24,810
Hmm...

2608
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:33,290
I ash... ash... ash... fow believe in you.

2609
02:34:33,410 --> 02:34:33,950
Thank you.

2610
02:34:37,850 --> 02:34:39,370
It's fifty-fifty right now.

2611
02:34:41,770 --> 02:34:43,390
Even if I steal the beer?

2612
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:45,150
It's not going to change anything.

2613
02:34:45,150 --> 02:34:49,370
Well, I guess it would maybe decide if we want to shoot...

2614
02:34:49,370 --> 02:34:51,390
If we want to use it on ourselves or not, you know?

2615
02:34:53,270 --> 02:34:53,750
Hmm...

2616
02:34:54,730 --> 02:34:55,650
I'm deciding.

2617
02:34:55,950 --> 02:34:56,430
I'm deciding.

2618
02:34:58,090 --> 02:34:59,310
I think I will.

2619
02:35:09,830 --> 02:35:10,310
God...

2620
02:35:10,310 --> 02:35:12,170
I see it all!

2621
02:35:12,170 --> 02:35:12,790
Come on!

2622
02:35:15,930 --> 02:35:17,270
This is for you, Karma!

2623
02:35:17,530 --> 02:35:18,550
I'm pouring one out for you!

2624
02:35:19,070 --> 02:35:19,730
Oh, shoot.

2625
02:35:20,870 --> 02:35:22,470
I should have just used it.

2626
02:35:50,590 --> 02:35:51,770
Wait a second.

2627
02:35:53,050 --> 02:35:53,510
Wait!

2628
02:36:28,860 --> 02:36:29,860
Take the meds?

2629
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:30,100
Yeah.

2630
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:30,900
Take the meds.

2631
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:34,260
Win the fifty-fifty!

2632
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:50,700
I'm actually tripling.

2633
02:36:58,840 --> 02:36:59,460
Um...

2634
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:03,000
Goodbye, Karma.

2635
02:37:06,300 --> 02:37:08,180
How does that Taylor Swift song go?

2636
02:37:08,180 --> 02:37:10,240
Karma is a god.

2637
02:37:10,380 --> 02:37:11,400
Karma is a...

2638
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:11,800
What?

2639
02:37:16,820 --> 02:37:17,600
Wait, what?

2640
02:37:32,140 --> 02:37:32,820
How?

2641
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:36,960
How did we?

2642
02:37:37,640 --> 02:37:38,320
How?

2643
02:37:45,640 --> 02:37:46,800
How did we?

2644
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:48,440
How did we?

2645
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:49,480
How?

2646
02:37:53,230 --> 02:37:54,790
How did we win?

2647
02:37:59,210 --> 02:38:00,090
parall Sweets!

2648
02:38:00,090 --> 02:38:00,450
4 -in-3.

2649
02:38:09,850 --> 02:38:10,290
Okay.

2650
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:17,840
We're just gonna do diamonds.

2651
02:38:22,180 --> 02:38:23,220
Please be linve.

2652
02:38:24,360 --> 02:38:24,800
Blank.

2653
02:38:24,860 --> 02:38:25,400
It's OK.

2654
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:26,460
Actually, he twas have medicine.

2655
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:27,860
So just...

2656
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:32,500
Okay, now it's 3-in-3.

2657
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:34,040
Pleas be live, blank.

2658
02:38:37,320 --> 02:38:38,400
Three and three.

2659
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:43,040
He's got pretty decent stuff over there.

2660
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:44,000
To know the future.

2661
02:38:52,220 --> 02:38:53,260
Song go for it?

2662
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:53,540
Yup.

2663
02:38:56,300 --> 02:38:57,180
I think so.

2664
02:38:57,420 --> 02:38:57,860
What the?

2665
02:39:01,190 --> 02:39:01,830
Wait, what?

2666
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:04,830
Sorry, my chat just...

2667
02:39:04,830 --> 02:39:05,370
What?

2668
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:07,870
I can use now YTC filter on the backend?

2669
02:39:10,150 --> 02:39:11,990
Uh, hold on.

2670
02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:13,910
I can't reach out anymore because of the...

2671
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:14,190
Wait.

2672
02:39:14,350 --> 02:39:14,830
What?

2673
02:39:14,910 --> 02:39:15,570
It just updated.

2674
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:16,410
What?

2675
02:39:16,910 --> 02:39:17,710
That's crazy.

2676
02:39:18,730 --> 02:39:19,710
Yeah, new update.

2677
02:39:19,790 --> 02:39:20,950
It just appeared out of nowhere.

2678
02:39:23,010 --> 02:39:24,390
Oh my gosh.

2679
02:39:24,490 --> 02:39:24,830
Yippee.

2680
02:39:26,110 --> 02:39:28,470
I have to put in all my presets and stuff.

2681
02:39:30,870 --> 02:39:31,350
Later.

2682
02:39:33,730 --> 02:39:35,390
Okay, did I shoot yet?

2683
02:39:36,810 --> 02:39:37,850
I saw it at all.

2684
02:39:37,870 --> 02:39:38,490
Okay, here we go.

2685
02:39:38,570 --> 02:39:39,410
Let's hope for the best.

2686
02:39:47,370 --> 02:39:47,850
Yup.

2687
02:39:48,050 --> 02:39:49,010
That sounds about right.

2688
02:39:53,730 --> 02:39:55,010
I can see you guys now.

2689
02:39:55,170 --> 02:39:55,670
No worries.

2690
02:39:59,980 --> 02:40:00,700
Oh, karma.

2691
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,660
Karma is the cat sitting on my lap.

2692
02:40:04,860 --> 02:40:06,860
Karma is the breeze in my hair.

2693
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:12,040
Oh, what?

2694
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:12,960
You got rid of the...

2695
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:14,760
Wait, why did you do that, you dummy?

2696
02:40:51,850 --> 02:40:53,170
But that's it, right?

2697
02:40:54,970 --> 02:40:55,410
Yeah.

2698
02:40:56,230 --> 02:40:57,190
So we lived.

2699
02:40:57,430 --> 02:40:57,870
Yes.

2700
02:40:57,950 --> 02:41:00,230
He didn't have two saws just like we did.

2701
02:41:00,670 --> 02:41:01,870
And fumble them both.

2702
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:05,370
You know.

2703
02:41:05,370 --> 02:41:08,010
Oh, three and three.

2704
02:41:10,530 --> 02:41:11,990
Surely the pills will save us.

2705
02:41:13,590 --> 02:41:16,150
We won't lose the 50-50 three times in a row.

2706
02:41:39,090 --> 02:41:39,710
What was it?

2707
02:41:39,770 --> 02:41:40,210
Three and three?

2708
02:41:44,810 --> 02:41:45,650
Three and three, right?

2709
02:42:02,060 --> 02:42:03,360
Maybe I should have...

2710
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:06,900
Actually, maybe I should have checked it first.

2711
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:09,440
And then inverted it.

2712
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:09,800
You know what?

2713
02:42:09,820 --> 02:42:10,340
No, it doesn't matter.

2714
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:13,340
I think we're pretty dead.

2715
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:16,380
It doesn't matter, you guys.

2716
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:18,040
It doesn't matter.

2717
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,000
It doesn't...

2718
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:20,180
It doesn't matter.

2719
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:22,340
It doesn't matter.

2720
02:42:39,780 --> 02:42:41,580
Oh, he can take my thing.

2721
02:42:42,280 --> 02:42:43,160
Oh, he can...

2722
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:44,980
Unless he really throws.

2723
02:42:45,620 --> 02:42:47,020
Welcome home from Anime Expo.

2724
02:42:47,020 --> 02:42:47,540
How was your trip?

2725
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:48,020
It was great.

2726
02:42:48,020 --> 02:42:48,220
It was great.

2727
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:54,040
Karma is the breeze in my hair.

2728
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:56,780
Karma is the cat that sleeps on me.

2729
02:42:57,180 --> 02:42:58,220
Karma is...

2730
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:08,880
I feel like I'm in the bathroom from Silent Hill.

2731
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:16,800
Goodbye, Karma.

2732
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:17,940
Thank you, GG.

2733
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:19,800
All right.

2734
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:20,680
LG, you guys.

2735
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:21,700
We got to make this one count.

2736
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:23,800
We got to make this one count.

2737
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:25,580
We got to...

2738
02:43:25,580 --> 02:43:27,120
Minus three viewers.

2739
02:43:27,720 --> 02:43:29,440
This next person will be the one.

2740
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:31,000
I'm not going to take the...

2741
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,300
I'm not going to be under the influence this time, okay?

2742
02:43:34,280 --> 02:43:35,900
I won't be under the influence.

2743
02:43:35,960 --> 02:43:36,940
Who's the next victim?

2744
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:37,740
Mr. Peace.

2745
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:39,000
All the wisps who have died.

2746
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:44,300
I'm going to be...

2747
02:43:44,300 --> 02:43:45,560
I'm good now.

2748
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:47,060
I'm a clean...

2749
02:43:47,060 --> 02:43:48,260
I'm a clean ghost.

2750
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:54,480
So who would like to volunteer?

2751
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:57,020
Put me in coach.

2752
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:57,860
Okay, Splagoon.

2753
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:03,240
Splago.

2754
02:44:05,460 --> 02:44:06,180
Wait, no.

2755
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:07,740
That's bad luck, Splagoon.

2756
02:44:08,220 --> 02:44:09,460
You're going to splago...

2757
02:44:09,460 --> 02:44:10,760
to the Pools.

2758
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:12,160
Yippee.

2759
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:22,500
What do you get?

2760
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:23,560
Can of beer.

2761
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:26,000
And a can of beer.

2762
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:35,980
He has two magnifying glasses!

2763
02:44:48,300 --> 02:44:51,080
I guess let's make this three and three.

2764
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:51,740
How about it?

2765
02:44:56,920 --> 02:44:57,600
Alright.

2766
02:44:57,600 --> 02:44:59,420
To help feed the addiction.

2767
02:45:00,500 --> 02:45:02,520
Thank you, Blaze Hunter Dragon.

2768
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:05,000
Why are you hunting?

2769
02:45:06,320 --> 02:45:07,920
And the live one, right?

2770
02:45:08,900 --> 02:45:09,420
Yup.

2771
02:45:09,620 --> 02:45:10,560
Three and three!

2772
02:45:10,980 --> 02:45:11,680
Three and three!

2773
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:13,820
That's exactly what I said would happen.

2774
02:45:14,200 --> 02:45:16,280
That's exactly what I said would happen, isn't it?

2775
02:45:27,340 --> 02:45:28,620
What do we do, you guys?

2776
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:29,140
What do we do?

2777
02:45:29,160 --> 02:45:29,520
What do we do?

2778
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:30,680
Nothing has changed.

2779
02:45:31,800 --> 02:45:33,340
Absolutely nothing has changed.

2780
02:45:40,260 --> 02:45:42,180
Nothing has changed.

2781
02:45:48,080 --> 02:45:49,040
Shoot?

2782
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:50,080
Okay.

2783
02:46:13,190 --> 02:46:14,290
It's okay.

2784
02:46:14,450 --> 02:46:15,510
I've felt this before.

2785
02:46:24,410 --> 02:46:26,050
Uh, he didn't... yeah, he didn't beer.

2786
02:46:26,130 --> 02:46:26,670
He didn't have one.

2787
02:46:27,390 --> 02:46:29,050
So now it's just 2-2.

2788
02:46:31,690 --> 02:46:32,210
Alright!

2789
02:46:33,550 --> 02:46:34,690
I choose you!

2790
02:46:37,010 --> 02:46:37,530
Splat!

2791
02:46:37,750 --> 02:46:38,270
Go!

2792
02:46:44,210 --> 02:46:44,930
It worked!

2793
02:46:49,750 --> 02:46:51,590
You're looking a little scared there mister.

2794
02:46:56,470 --> 02:46:58,050
It's super effective!

2795
02:47:07,270 --> 02:47:08,650
Don't do it to me!

2796
02:47:14,030 --> 02:47:15,350
Careful now.

2797
02:47:15,850 --> 02:47:16,510
Splatoon.

2798
02:47:20,230 --> 02:47:21,510
Your luck Splatoon.

2799
02:47:22,310 --> 02:47:23,610
Don't play the lottery.

2800
02:47:24,030 --> 02:47:25,150
We got some cigarettes!

2801
02:47:25,410 --> 02:47:26,370
Your luck Splatoon!

2802
02:47:26,430 --> 02:47:26,570
Splatoon!

2803
02:47:29,590 --> 02:47:30,810
Two live, three.

2804
02:47:45,130 --> 02:47:46,690
Third shell live.

2805
02:47:49,270 --> 02:47:50,210
Team mail.

2806
02:47:50,390 --> 02:47:51,430
Team mail activate!

2807
02:47:54,030 --> 02:47:55,890
He has the knife, I know.

2808
02:47:56,430 --> 02:47:59,170
But he also has a useless item because I got rid of all my stuff.

2809
02:48:00,650 --> 02:48:02,310
So he only has the knife.

2810
02:48:05,610 --> 02:48:06,770
Eat the first two?

2811
02:48:16,580 --> 02:48:17,060
Smart.

2812
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:27,560
So now it's what?

2813
02:48:30,860 --> 02:48:32,060
It's 2-2, right?

2814
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:32,980
50-50?

2815
02:48:33,780 --> 02:48:35,600
I think it's live, but it's fine.

2816
02:48:37,380 --> 02:48:38,620
It wasn't live.

2817
02:48:54,960 --> 02:48:56,660
Oh, come on!

2818
02:48:56,720 --> 02:48:57,260
This is so...

2819
02:48:58,180 --> 02:48:58,980
Goodbye!

2820
02:49:23,170 --> 02:49:24,770
Oh Splatoon!

2821
02:49:25,170 --> 02:49:26,310
We hardly...

2822
02:49:26,310 --> 02:49:28,530
We hardly knew ye.

2823
02:49:29,890 --> 02:49:31,470
We hardly knew ye.

2824
02:49:31,610 --> 02:49:32,590
You were so...

2825
02:49:32,590 --> 02:49:34,230
Splagon to the afterlife.

2826
02:49:36,670 --> 02:49:38,210
I'm not laughing, I'm crying.

2827
02:49:38,330 --> 02:49:39,410
You can see my tears.

2828
02:49:39,890 --> 02:49:40,510
I'm not...

2829
02:49:40,510 --> 02:49:41,730
There's no time for jokes.

2830
02:49:43,890 --> 02:49:45,110
Sorry, I'm still crying.

2831
02:49:45,250 --> 02:49:47,310
My cries just sound like laughing.

2832
02:49:50,040 --> 02:49:51,350
It's so sad, just gone.

2833
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:52,610
I'm a ghost too.

2834
02:49:53,150 --> 02:49:54,730
It's just gone too soon.

2835
02:49:58,190 --> 02:49:59,930
Sorry, I'm not laughing.

2836
02:50:00,070 --> 02:50:02,650
It just sounds suspiciously like I'm laughing.

2837
02:50:06,610 --> 02:50:07,210
Alright.

2838
02:50:08,710 --> 02:50:09,630
Actual LG.

2839
02:50:10,970 --> 02:50:11,930
Actual LG.

2840
02:50:12,150 --> 02:50:13,630
That one was so short.

2841
02:50:15,350 --> 02:50:16,890
Again, I'm not under the influence.

2842
02:50:20,870 --> 02:50:22,350
I'm not even listening to music.

2843
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:24,570
I don't even care about EDM anymore.

2844
02:50:25,110 --> 02:50:26,030
I'm a change.

2845
02:50:26,030 --> 02:50:26,590
I'm a...

2846
02:50:26,590 --> 02:50:27,150
I only give...

2847
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:28,290
I only listen to shoegaze.

2848
02:50:29,910 --> 02:50:31,510
Who is our victim?

2849
02:50:32,650 --> 02:50:33,670
Not victim.

2850
02:50:33,930 --> 02:50:34,670
You're gonna win.

2851
02:50:37,270 --> 02:50:38,450
Shout out to bird.

2852
02:50:40,970 --> 02:50:42,090
I volunteer.

2853
02:50:42,790 --> 02:50:43,470
Birds.

2854
02:50:44,650 --> 02:50:45,330
Michael.

2855
02:50:48,310 --> 02:50:49,530
I volunteer.

2856
02:50:51,730 --> 02:50:52,070
Dubbug.

2857
02:50:52,950 --> 02:50:55,650
How about we combine your names?

2858
02:51:00,260 --> 02:51:01,860
The Mick Love.

2859
02:51:08,140 --> 02:51:12,160
Michael and Lovebug together makes the Mick Love.

2860
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:17,120
Don't sue me.

2861
02:51:19,280 --> 02:51:20,420
Oh, come on.

2862
02:51:22,740 --> 02:51:23,780
50-50.

2863
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:32,670
All righty.

2864
02:51:34,790 --> 02:51:35,490
He's gonna...

2865
02:51:35,490 --> 02:51:35,930
Wait.

2866
02:51:36,050 --> 02:51:36,450
Well...

2867
02:51:36,450 --> 02:51:37,430
Oh, no.

2868
02:51:37,490 --> 02:51:37,930
It was live.

2869
02:51:43,800 --> 02:51:45,240
I wish I had the knife.

2870
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:49,280
You okay there, ma'am?

2871
02:51:51,820 --> 02:51:56,640
When he holds it up to himself with such a despair look on his face, it's so funny.

2872
02:51:58,960 --> 02:51:59,420
Okay.

2873
02:51:59,860 --> 02:52:00,620
All right.

2874
02:52:01,820 --> 02:52:02,840
He didn't use any weapons.

2875
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:03,500
He didn't use any of his stuff.

2876
02:52:03,740 --> 02:52:04,640
It just kind of sucks.

2877
02:52:04,880 --> 02:52:05,480
Two and two.

2878
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:07,120
Are you winning, son?

2879
02:52:07,260 --> 02:52:07,840
Oh, yeah.

2880
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:11,480
Oh, yeah.

2881
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:14,560
He's got all the good items.

2882
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:15,460
What's up with this?

2883
02:52:20,120 --> 02:52:21,260
Third shell blank.

2884
02:52:23,400 --> 02:52:25,380
Clubbing is what happens in a McDonald's bag.

2885
02:52:30,940 --> 02:52:33,320
Why do you look like you came from the Powerpuff Girls?

2886
02:52:33,580 --> 02:52:33,900
Oh, my God.

2887
02:52:33,900 --> 02:52:33,920
Oh, my God.

2888
02:52:35,720 --> 02:52:36,720
What are you talking about?

2889
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:40,120
I look nothing like a Powerpuff Girl.

2890
02:52:42,120 --> 02:52:43,940
At least one live in the first two.

2891
02:52:44,240 --> 02:52:44,680
Yeah.

2892
02:52:55,340 --> 02:52:56,020
What was it?

2893
02:52:56,020 --> 02:52:56,960
It was two-two though, right?

2894
02:53:06,620 --> 02:53:07,820
They're literally bubbles.

2895
02:53:08,020 --> 02:53:08,600
Don't say that.

2896
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:10,080
I always wanted to be Buttercup.

2897
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:13,820
Then I'm next.

2898
02:53:14,060 --> 02:53:15,100
I was born for this one.

2899
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:17,840
Two-two.

2900
02:53:17,880 --> 02:53:18,460
Third blank.

2901
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:18,580
Oh, my God.

2902
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:18,700
I'm a power bank.

2903
02:53:18,740 --> 02:53:19,040
Yeah.

2904
02:53:39,440 --> 02:53:41,240
Yeah, if you don't use an inverter, you're dead.

2905
02:53:41,380 --> 02:53:41,700
I know.

2906
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:43,720
I'm trying to think how to use... when to use it.

2907
02:53:50,460 --> 02:53:53,120
Yeah, he can see the shots.

2908
02:53:53,180 --> 02:53:53,520
I know.

2909
02:53:55,120 --> 02:53:55,460
Oh.

2910
02:54:03,720 --> 02:54:05,500
I think I'm just going to shoot him.

2911
02:54:11,380 --> 02:54:12,820
We're McLovin'!

2912
02:54:15,580 --> 02:54:16,300
Yippee!

2913
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:28,660
What have I got?

2914
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:29,760
Beer!

2915
02:54:30,320 --> 02:54:31,320
Cell phone!

2916
02:54:33,220 --> 02:54:33,740
Polarizer!

2917
02:54:35,380 --> 02:54:37,100
Why do they always give him a knife?

2918
02:54:39,580 --> 02:54:40,480
Two and three.

2919
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:47,380
All skill, by the way.

2920
02:54:47,540 --> 02:54:48,220
I know.

2921
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:53,720
Damn, we just got... wait.

2922
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:55,680
Two, three... one, three!

2923
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:02,120
Second shell blank.

2924
02:55:04,440 --> 02:55:06,240
I wish you had told me where the live one was.

2925
02:55:33,400 --> 02:55:35,460
And so this one's blank, for sure, right?

2926
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:39,100
Oh my goodness.

2927
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:44,120
So this is the... it said the second one was... or wait, right?

2928
02:55:45,080 --> 02:55:45,440
Yeah.

2929
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:48,960
No, wait.

2930
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:50,440
Wasn't it the third one it said?

2931
02:55:50,660 --> 02:55:51,560
Wait, I'm so confused.

2932
02:55:51,700 --> 02:55:52,220
I can't remember.

2933
02:55:53,440 --> 02:55:55,580
Everything... all the past games are blending together.

2934
02:56:01,360 --> 02:56:02,660
I thought it was the third.

2935
02:56:03,720 --> 02:56:04,560
Second is blank.

2936
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:05,280
It was the second?

2937
02:56:05,420 --> 02:56:05,920
Okay, okay.

2938
02:56:06,460 --> 02:56:07,320
It said second.

2939
02:56:07,460 --> 02:56:07,660
Okay.

2940
02:56:07,880 --> 02:56:08,600
Thank you, guys.

2941
02:56:18,580 --> 02:56:20,140
Well, we know it's blank.

2942
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:24,280
Screw it.

2943
02:56:33,190 --> 02:56:33,930
Take him out!

2944
02:56:34,030 --> 02:56:34,990
But he's going to use his medicine.

2945
02:56:35,930 --> 02:56:36,650
It's okay, though.

2946
02:56:37,730 --> 02:56:38,290
They're

2947
02:56:42,540 --> 02:56:43,240
all blanks!

2948
02:56:43,240 --> 02:56:44,460
The rest of them are blanks!

2949
02:57:00,220 --> 02:57:00,780
Nice.

2950
02:57:06,420 --> 02:57:06,980
Okay.

2951
02:57:10,340 --> 02:57:11,680
Three and four.

2952
02:57:11,900 --> 02:57:13,060
Three live, four blank.

2953
02:57:26,300 --> 02:57:26,860
Blank.

2954
02:57:32,470 --> 02:57:33,630
I don't think it's worth.

2955
02:57:36,050 --> 02:57:36,630
All right.

2956
02:57:36,690 --> 02:57:37,250
Three and three.

2957
02:57:38,290 --> 02:57:39,210
I'm going to check it again.

2958
02:57:54,060 --> 02:57:58,100
If he takes the medicine, if he fails, he'll die, so...

2959
02:57:59,220 --> 02:58:00,700
But I don't think he's going to fail.

2960
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:05,600
I think...

2961
02:58:07,320 --> 02:58:09,800
I think... I think... I'm nervous.

2962
02:58:13,820 --> 02:58:15,240
Is he not going to take the medicine?

2963
02:58:15,880 --> 02:58:16,860
He didn't take it.

2964
02:58:58,800 --> 02:58:59,460
Wait, but...

2965
02:59:00,320 --> 02:59:02,560
This is the blank, though, isn't it?

2966
02:59:03,040 --> 02:59:03,420
So...

2967
02:59:06,040 --> 02:59:07,300
This is the blank one, though.

2968
02:59:12,830 --> 02:59:13,210
Yeah!

2969
02:59:16,790 --> 02:59:18,830
You should have taken your medicine, Bozo!

2970
02:59:22,410 --> 02:59:23,170
We're McLovin!

2971
02:59:27,570 --> 02:59:29,250
This is why you always take your meds, everybody.

2972
02:59:29,770 --> 02:59:31,210
Unless they make you a little...

2973
02:59:31,750 --> 02:59:32,670
Well, those are...

2974
02:59:33,450 --> 02:59:34,010
You know.

2975
02:59:34,010 --> 02:59:34,830
That was the game.

2976
02:59:35,030 --> 02:59:35,230
That was...

2977
02:59:35,230 --> 02:59:35,510
You know.

2978
02:59:35,710 --> 02:59:36,410
That's fine.

2979
02:59:42,340 --> 02:59:43,340
Four and four.

2980
02:59:45,660 --> 02:59:47,260
I don't know if he's got medicine.

2981
02:59:49,980 --> 02:59:51,000
Let's see what we got.

2982
02:59:51,300 --> 02:59:51,940
Four and...

2983
02:59:51,940 --> 02:59:54,040
The phones are always hard when it's so many bullets.

2984
02:59:54,620 --> 02:59:56,160
Fifth shell, live round.

2985
02:59:59,260 --> 03:00:00,080
Okay, thanks.

2986
03:00:01,280 --> 03:00:01,980
I guess.

2987
03:00:03,380 --> 03:00:04,240
I guess.

2988
03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:05,660
This is easy.

2989
03:00:42,640 --> 03:00:43,920
Yes...

2990
03:01:02,300 --> 03:01:03,580
Three.

2991
03:01:07,430 --> 03:01:08,710
Four.

2992
03:01:12,450 --> 03:01:13,730
Five.

2993
03:01:19,690 --> 03:01:21,370
But he's going to...

2994
03:01:21,370 --> 03:01:22,190
He's going to heal.

2995
03:01:25,690 --> 03:01:26,970
Be

2996
03:01:38,130 --> 03:01:39,110
careful now!

2997
03:01:58,990 --> 03:02:00,270
One...

2998
03:02:00,270 --> 03:02:01,430
Two...

2999
03:02:21,590 --> 03:02:25,630
I think I have to risk it for the biscuit.

3000
03:02:26,590 --> 03:02:29,970
I can only risk it for the biscuit!

3001
03:02:30,350 --> 03:02:33,670
Because even if I get it wrong, I still die!

3002
03:02:34,190 --> 03:02:35,590
I must eat it!

3003
03:02:38,650 --> 03:02:44,050
I... my name is Raiden Intoya... whatever his name is.

3004
03:02:46,290 --> 03:02:48,850
You killed my family and made me eat gunpowder.

3005
03:02:49,150 --> 03:02:50,270
Prepare to die.

3006
03:03:09,210 --> 03:03:09,810
Cigs!

3007
03:03:09,830 --> 03:03:10,190
Cigs!

3008
03:03:10,270 --> 03:03:10,630
Cigs!

3009
03:03:10,910 --> 03:03:11,510
Cigs!

3010
03:03:11,590 --> 03:03:11,990
Cigarettes!

3011
03:03:12,150 --> 03:03:12,590
Cigarettes!

3012
03:03:13,110 --> 03:03:13,710
CIGARETTES!

3013
03:03:15,970 --> 03:03:16,570
Two

3014
03:03:27,150 --> 03:03:27,890
and three.

3015
03:03:28,510 --> 03:03:29,510
Come on!

3016
03:03:29,530 --> 03:03:30,030
Come on!

3017
03:03:30,030 --> 03:03:31,790
Why would you do this to my hand?

3018
03:03:33,830 --> 03:03:35,610
It's basically 50-50.

3019
03:03:35,850 --> 03:03:38,950
It's basically 50-50.

3020
03:03:54,950 --> 03:03:56,530
Yeah, he has the combo.

3021
03:03:56,650 --> 03:03:59,690
The wombo combo of the glass and the inverter.

3022
03:03:59,870 --> 03:04:00,450
It doesn't matter.

3023
03:04:00,930 --> 03:04:05,290
Whatever he... whatever it's... if it's blank, it doesn't matter!

3024
03:04:16,570 --> 03:04:17,230
Folks.

3025
03:04:18,730 --> 03:04:26,990
We gathered here in the dingiest... the dingiest bathroom on the whole planet.

3026
03:04:29,270 --> 03:04:32,130
But you know what that bathroom still had?

3027
03:04:34,010 --> 03:04:34,810
Love.

3028
03:04:35,930 --> 03:04:36,690
And bugs.

3029
03:04:37,270 --> 03:04:38,410
And Michael.

3030
03:04:39,810 --> 03:04:41,110
And you know...

3031
03:04:42,010 --> 03:04:45,110
That's just... all that matters on this...

3032
03:04:45,710 --> 03:04:46,770
Hell of an earth.

3033
03:04:48,990 --> 03:04:50,890
No matter where you are...

3034
03:04:52,330 --> 03:04:53,450
No matter...

3035
03:04:57,120 --> 03:04:58,240
No matter...

3036
03:04:58,240 --> 03:05:00,780
How the odds are against you...

3037
03:05:00,780 --> 03:05:02,300
You have love.

3038
03:05:06,360 --> 03:05:08,720
And on the other side of that coin is hate.

3039
03:05:08,820 --> 03:05:09,560
Now eat this!

3040
03:05:16,790 --> 03:05:17,350
Bastard!

3041
03:05:17,350 --> 03:05:19,090
But you'll never take me down!

3042
03:05:19,990 --> 03:05:20,410
Ah!

3043
03:05:32,470 --> 03:05:35,050
At least I shot you before I died!

3044
03:05:42,560 --> 03:05:43,600
Oh man.

3045
03:05:48,060 --> 03:05:49,080
GG everybody.

3046
03:05:49,660 --> 03:05:51,700
At least I beat the first game.

3047
03:05:53,960 --> 03:05:54,740
Oh my gosh.

3048
03:05:54,780 --> 03:05:57,900
I feel myself already addicted to this game too much a little bit.

3049
03:05:59,780 --> 03:06:00,260
GG.

3050
03:06:01,440 --> 03:06:02,860
To Michael and...

3051
03:06:02,860 --> 03:06:03,740
Lovebug.

3052
03:06:06,560 --> 03:06:09,160
I think... I think that was actually my last game.

3053
03:06:09,220 --> 03:06:10,360
Careful, she's a hero.

3054
03:06:14,700 --> 03:06:15,940
This was fun.

3055
03:06:16,360 --> 03:06:17,440
This was a good time.

3056
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:19,320
This was pretty fun.

3057
03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:21,140
I think I could gamble...

3058
03:06:21,140 --> 03:06:23,680
Would you guys want to gamble a little bit more with your lives?

3059
03:06:24,220 --> 03:06:25,220
Would you guys...

3060
03:06:25,220 --> 03:06:27,340
Would you guys volunteer some more to...

3061
03:06:27,340 --> 03:06:28,960
gamble your lives away...

3062
03:06:28,960 --> 03:06:30,420
by my hands?

3063
03:06:30,580 --> 03:06:30,780
Go!

3064
03:06:31,320 --> 03:06:32,500
Thanks for the GG.

3065
03:06:34,180 --> 03:06:34,760
Yeah?

3066
03:06:39,500 --> 03:06:41,380
I have to fix something on here.

3067
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:45,540
Hold on.

3068
03:07:04,860 --> 03:07:07,600
I just want to double check you're not allergic to coconut.

3069
03:07:07,880 --> 03:07:08,100
No?

3070
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:09,000
I'm not.

3071
03:07:09,020 --> 03:07:10,380
I don't think I have any allergies.

3072
03:07:12,580 --> 03:07:14,920
We live and die by your orders, boss.

3073
03:07:17,700 --> 03:07:18,500
Shining diamonds.

3074
03:07:20,780 --> 03:07:23,160
You're all my shining diamonds truly.

3075
03:07:24,740 --> 03:07:26,160
Aren't you allergic to eggs?

3076
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:28,200
Eggs... well like... kind of?

3077
03:07:28,320 --> 03:07:33,580
I don't think... I actually have never gotten... only if I eat eggs in a certain way do I...

3078
03:07:35,200 --> 03:07:38,360
Do I... do I get a headache sometimes?

3079
03:07:42,480 --> 03:07:43,940
I ain't of no ghost?

3080
03:07:44,020 --> 03:07:44,140
No!

3081
03:07:44,340 --> 03:07:46,240
It says I ain't afraid of no ghost!

3082
03:07:48,660 --> 03:07:49,140
Raw?

3083
03:07:49,680 --> 03:07:53,160
No, if I eat like regular scrambled eggs, I get a migraine.

3084
03:07:54,040 --> 03:07:55,120
Or... not a migraine.

3085
03:07:55,260 --> 03:07:56,340
Well, sometimes a migraine.

3086
03:07:56,420 --> 03:07:56,620
It depends.

3087
03:07:59,020 --> 03:08:01,360
Thank you for streaming, even though you said you weren't feeling great earlier.

3088
03:08:01,500 --> 03:08:04,400
I was having a rough day myself, but your streams are always fun, so thank you.

3089
03:08:04,420 --> 03:08:04,920
Thank you!

3090
03:08:06,660 --> 03:08:07,720
Yeah, I don't know.

3091
03:08:07,760 --> 03:08:09,960
Just like some things that...

3092
03:08:11,420 --> 03:08:14,680
haven't been working in my favor, but it was a really good weekend.

3093
03:08:17,620 --> 03:08:17,980
So...

3094
03:08:19,400 --> 03:08:20,680
But I still eat eggs anyway.

3095
03:08:21,200 --> 03:08:22,060
I don't really care.

3096
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:22,940
I like eggs.

3097
03:08:23,160 --> 03:08:24,180
I'm gonna eat them.

3098
03:08:26,440 --> 03:08:29,060
I ain't of no... I ain't afraid of no ghost.

3099
03:08:33,500 --> 03:08:35,760
I don't put salt in my eggs though.

3100
03:08:37,400 --> 03:08:39,840
I can eat scrambled eggs if I eat them with ketchup.

3101
03:08:40,580 --> 03:08:42,000
But I can't eat them by themselves.

3102
03:08:43,200 --> 03:08:44,520
That's why I don't think I'm allergic.

3103
03:08:44,720 --> 03:08:46,920
I think it's just my brain is weird.

3104
03:08:52,820 --> 03:08:55,460
How many ghosts do you ain't of?

3105
03:09:07,600 --> 03:09:09,340
What's your favorite style of egg?

3106
03:09:13,180 --> 03:09:13,740
Scrambled.

3107
03:09:16,920 --> 03:09:18,240
With ketchup.

3108
03:09:22,160 --> 03:09:24,560
My greens are awful and very weird.

3109
03:09:32,660 --> 03:09:36,420
I don't particularly like where your voice takes me to.

3110
03:09:37,780 --> 03:09:38,980
You're awesome.

3111
03:09:39,800 --> 03:09:40,860
Thank you!

3112
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:43,000
07 to all the fallen wisps.

3113
03:09:46,100 --> 03:09:53,840
Let us honor our fallen with these sick beats in the background.

3114
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:05,200
You would have loved this one, Karma!

3115
03:10:10,100 --> 03:10:12,580
08 to all the fallen wisps.

3116
03:10:14,780 --> 03:10:15,460
09 to all the dead.

3117
03:10:15,460 --> 03:10:16,460
the wisps are dead.

3118
03:10:22,840 --> 03:10:23,560
Ew, honestly, I hate that song.

3119
03:10:23,560 --> 03:10:26,400
The wisps are dead.isphere wisps are dead.

3120
03:10:26,520 --> 03:10:28,780
The Wisps are Dead x3 Plum.

3121
03:10:34,460 --> 03:10:38,580
The wisps are dead... Plum.

3122
03:10:38,580 --> 03:10:43,620
The wisps are dead, the wisps are dead They

3123
03:10:50,170 --> 03:11:11,430
died, they're not alive They died on the dancefloor

3124
03:11:17,830 --> 03:11:36,150
The wisps are dead, the wisps are dead They died

3125
03:11:42,030 --> 03:11:44,570
on the dancefloor

3126
03:11:54,890 --> 03:11:56,770
They're never coming back.

3127
03:11:58,110 --> 03:12:00,090
We have to call their family.

3128
03:12:01,510 --> 03:12:03,290
Who's taking care of their cat?

3129
03:12:06,570 --> 03:12:07,350
It's you!

3130
03:12:08,070 --> 03:12:15,910
The wisps are dead, the wisps are dead The wisps are dead, the wisps are dead The wisps are dead, dead, dead!

3131
03:12:26,470 --> 03:12:28,190
How did they die?

3132
03:12:28,390 --> 03:12:29,970
How did they die?

3133
03:12:30,070 --> 03:12:32,270
They died from dropping to the speed!

3134
03:12:53,210 --> 03:12:54,110
Thank you guys.

3135
03:12:54,490 --> 03:12:55,750
Anyway, I'm done with that.

3136
03:12:56,890 --> 03:12:57,850
How do I leave here?

3137
03:12:58,390 --> 03:13:00,470
I got an achievement for listening to the song.

3138
03:13:03,310 --> 03:13:04,790
Do you know a way out?

3139
03:13:11,550 --> 03:13:12,550
I'm just gonna...

3140
03:13:15,790 --> 03:13:17,030
I'm just gonna...

3141
03:13:19,070 --> 03:13:21,030
Hold this game, you're so right.

3142
03:13:25,850 --> 03:13:27,010
There we go.

3143
03:13:29,750 --> 03:13:30,430
Thank you.

3144
03:13:32,270 --> 03:13:33,350
This is so fun!

3145
03:13:35,170 --> 03:13:38,670
I wanna play it again and win the double or nothing.

3146
03:13:40,470 --> 03:13:41,690
Can we get a bust in today?

3147
03:13:41,790 --> 03:13:42,670
I was just thinking that!

3148
03:13:47,990 --> 03:13:49,490
Same time next week?

3149
03:13:49,690 --> 03:13:50,330
Always.

3150
03:13:52,710 --> 03:13:54,490
Always same time next week.

3151
03:13:56,150 --> 03:13:57,670
Old game on Steam sale?

3152
03:13:58,750 --> 03:14:00,670
Call our neighbors from hell.

3153
03:14:00,990 --> 03:14:02,690
It's a click and point puzzle game.

3154
03:14:04,910 --> 03:14:05,550
Oh!

3155
03:14:05,550 --> 03:14:06,850
Let me write that down.

3156
03:14:10,130 --> 03:14:11,330
Thanks for the suggestion!

3157
03:14:12,710 --> 03:14:13,990
Thank you!

3158
03:14:14,870 --> 03:14:15,690
DavidTitanium, thank you!

3159
03:14:15,970 --> 03:14:18,110
Oh sorry, DavidTitaniumPP.

3160
03:14:19,670 --> 03:14:20,710
Can't believe she...

3161
03:14:20,710 --> 03:14:22,750
Can't believe the maid hates Omarize.

3162
03:14:22,850 --> 03:14:23,570
I never said that!

3163
03:14:26,550 --> 03:14:28,510
Thank you for the fun stream, also congrats on your concert!

3164
03:14:28,870 --> 03:14:30,150
Thank you, TriPrincess!

3165
03:14:30,970 --> 03:14:33,050
Wasn't there to watch live but saw a clip of you singing.

3166
03:14:33,130 --> 03:14:35,110
You deserve every light stick for your lovely performance.

3167
03:14:36,250 --> 03:14:37,430
Oh my gosh, you guys.

3168
03:14:38,050 --> 03:14:40,410
Hold on, let's move over to the talking stream.

3169
03:14:40,730 --> 03:14:41,770
Talking screen!

3170
03:14:43,510 --> 03:14:45,570
Something, hope you're having fun getting shot.

3171
03:14:47,010 --> 03:14:47,450
Yeah.

3172
03:14:49,450 --> 03:14:51,750
I beat judgment and I think that you'd love it.

3173
03:14:51,770 --> 03:14:54,090
Imagine a more serious Ace Attorney where you beat up people.

3174
03:14:55,730 --> 03:14:57,710
Where does the Ace Attorney come in?

3175
03:14:59,710 --> 03:15:03,250
Where does the Ace Attorney come in that situation?

3176
03:15:04,430 --> 03:15:06,370
Oh, hold on, let me exit out of the game.

3177
03:15:06,570 --> 03:15:08,250
We'll put on some more lively music.

3178
03:15:08,590 --> 03:15:09,470
Give me a second.

3179
03:15:10,990 --> 03:15:12,090
Well, maybe not.

3180
03:15:12,170 --> 03:15:13,490
I want to listen to some jazz.

3181
03:15:16,330 --> 03:15:16,770
Jazzy.

3182
03:15:29,100 --> 03:15:29,700
There we go.

3183
03:15:32,560 --> 03:15:33,640
They like dance.

3184
03:15:36,080 --> 03:15:37,700
Got some shots before MGS con.

3185
03:15:37,900 --> 03:15:38,400
Fox die.

3186
03:15:38,620 --> 03:15:39,880
More like Fox Jedi.

3187
03:15:40,320 --> 03:15:41,520
Oh, I'm still down here.

3188
03:15:46,300 --> 03:15:47,180
Fox Jedi.

3189
03:15:49,600 --> 03:15:50,940
Yeah, oh my gosh.

3190
03:15:51,020 --> 03:15:54,200
So I had, I went to, I had my virtual vacations concert.

3191
03:15:55,900 --> 03:15:57,240
Oh, this past weekend.

3192
03:15:57,800 --> 03:16:00,740
And I went to Anime Expo a little bit.

3193
03:16:02,260 --> 03:16:02,940
Let's see.

3194
03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:04,660
The concert was so fun.

3195
03:16:04,820 --> 03:16:05,780
It was...

3196
03:16:07,100 --> 03:16:07,960
It was...

3197
03:16:08,760 --> 03:16:10,440
It was very...

3198
03:16:11,260 --> 03:16:17,900
I've never sang before in like live like that.

3199
03:16:17,900 --> 03:16:21,360
Or rather, you know, because I was haunting the theater.

3200
03:16:24,060 --> 03:16:26,660
Usually, like in the past, it's always been digital.

3201
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:29,660
If I was singing at an event.

3202
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:34,600
And so it was the first time for me and I was so, so nervous.

3203
03:16:36,140 --> 03:16:38,780
I like the screenshots of the back rooms with the PSG.

3204
03:16:39,320 --> 03:16:41,200
The P... P... Wait.

3205
03:16:42,080 --> 03:16:43,560
Wait, not... Wait.

3206
03:16:43,740 --> 03:16:44,900
The MGS...

3207
03:16:44,900 --> 03:16:47,700
Why did I say the PSG?

3208
03:16:48,600 --> 03:16:50,460
I can't read.

3209
03:16:52,460 --> 03:16:52,920
I'm

3210
03:16:57,170 --> 03:16:58,350
like the PSG.

3211
03:17:05,430 --> 03:17:08,650
With the MGS3 filter.

3212
03:17:10,330 --> 03:17:13,610
Yes, this is what MGS1 does to people.

3213
03:17:14,070 --> 03:17:15,710
I'm like the PSG.

3214
03:17:18,540 --> 03:17:19,460
Yeah.

3215
03:17:19,640 --> 03:17:21,820
The room was so yellow.

3216
03:17:22,600 --> 03:17:23,980
Like I...

3217
03:17:24,480 --> 03:17:25,780
And I was just sitting...

3218
03:17:25,780 --> 03:17:28,560
It felt like, you know, when you wear those like what is the polarized sunglasses.

3219
03:17:28,780 --> 03:17:31,040
It felt like I just had those on like...

3220
03:17:32,180 --> 03:17:33,740
Not like the whole time.

3221
03:17:33,800 --> 03:17:34,740
It was so weird.

3222
03:17:35,840 --> 03:17:38,780
But I got to meet Bao and I got to meet Pandora.

3223
03:17:39,360 --> 03:17:40,660
And they were so sweet.

3224
03:17:41,680 --> 03:17:42,120
And...

3225
03:17:42,980 --> 03:17:44,120
It was fun.

3226
03:17:46,160 --> 03:17:46,600
My...

3227
03:17:46,600 --> 03:17:47,720
When it was...

3228
03:17:48,680 --> 03:17:50,800
So we had sound check obviously, right?

3229
03:17:51,140 --> 03:17:51,580
And...

3230
03:17:51,580 --> 03:17:52,860
They had us like...

3231
03:17:52,860 --> 03:17:54,080
Listen to the music.

3232
03:17:54,120 --> 03:18:00,340
We had like on little ear monitors so that we could hear the crowd but also hear the music and ourselves.

3233
03:18:02,580 --> 03:18:02,980
But...

3234
03:18:03,660 --> 03:18:08,700
You know, it's so different when you do the sound check without people.

3235
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:10,540
And then when you do the sound check with people.

3236
03:18:12,420 --> 03:18:12,820
Because...

3237
03:18:12,820 --> 03:18:16,580
Like in the middle of the show, I was like, oh my gosh, everybody's cheering so loudly.

3238
03:18:16,720 --> 03:18:17,400
I can't even...

3239
03:18:17,400 --> 03:18:18,400
I can't hear the BGM.

3240
03:18:18,580 --> 03:18:19,780
I can't hear the background music.

3241
03:18:20,080 --> 03:18:21,780
I couldn't hear the instrumentals.

3242
03:18:21,780 --> 03:18:23,140
So I was like...

3243
03:18:24,660 --> 03:18:27,480
During Geek and I Borderline, I even got like off timing.

3244
03:18:27,740 --> 03:18:28,260
I was like...

3245
03:18:28,260 --> 03:18:29,880
I was like, oh my gosh, I can't hear anything.

3246
03:18:30,760 --> 03:18:31,160
And...

3247
03:18:31,160 --> 03:18:32,260
It was so bad.

3248
03:18:32,540 --> 03:18:33,400
And then...

3249
03:18:33,400 --> 03:18:36,000
Also, I couldn't hear myself at some point.

3250
03:18:36,060 --> 03:18:36,740
So I was like...

3251
03:18:36,740 --> 03:18:40,760
Especially when I sang Stellar Stellar, I was so nervous for that song.

3252
03:18:40,820 --> 03:18:41,760
Like I can't even...

3253
03:18:41,760 --> 03:18:42,920
I was holding...

3254
03:18:42,920 --> 03:18:47,160
I printed out the lyrics because I wrote some notes on them for stuff.

3255
03:18:48,140 --> 03:18:49,960
And I was like holding it in front.

3256
03:18:50,280 --> 03:18:51,640
And my hand was shaking.

3257
03:18:51,640 --> 03:18:52,900
I was shaking so much.

3258
03:18:52,920 --> 03:18:54,880
I looked like a little shaking deer.

3259
03:18:55,180 --> 03:18:56,360
And I'm just like...

3260
03:18:56,360 --> 03:18:56,640
Like...

3261
03:18:57,320 --> 03:18:59,480
With my shaking hand, I'm like...

3262
03:19:03,620 --> 03:19:06,020
And I was like shaking so much.

3263
03:19:06,060 --> 03:19:07,240
I could barely read the lyrics.

3264
03:19:07,460 --> 03:19:08,620
I was so nervous.

3265
03:19:08,820 --> 03:19:10,000
Especially for that song.

3266
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:12,800
Because I really wanted to do it justice.

3267
03:19:13,420 --> 03:19:13,940
But...

3268
03:19:13,940 --> 03:19:17,400
Because it's like my favorite Vtuber song ever.

3269
03:19:17,520 --> 03:19:18,400
It's so...

3270
03:19:18,400 --> 03:19:19,800
It's so good.

3271
03:19:20,640 --> 03:19:21,160
But...

3272
03:19:21,160 --> 03:19:21,600
But...

3273
03:19:21,600 --> 03:19:21,620
But...

3274
03:19:21,620 --> 03:19:23,700
But I also couldn't hear what I sounded like.

3275
03:19:23,780 --> 03:19:24,160
So I was like...

3276
03:19:24,160 --> 03:19:25,540
I probably am botching it.

3277
03:19:30,920 --> 03:19:32,180
But it was good.

3278
03:19:32,960 --> 03:19:34,020
It was still fine.

3279
03:19:34,520 --> 03:19:35,280
I even...

3280
03:19:35,280 --> 03:19:36,060
I was so nervous.

3281
03:19:36,100 --> 03:19:36,820
I forgot my...

3282
03:19:36,820 --> 03:19:39,300
The backstage part was like upstairs.

3283
03:19:40,980 --> 03:19:43,720
So I even forgot my lyrics upstairs.

3284
03:19:43,840 --> 03:19:44,840
I had to go grab them.

3285
03:19:47,860 --> 03:19:48,300
So...

3286
03:19:48,980 --> 03:19:49,960
It was funny.

3287
03:19:50,040 --> 03:19:50,700
I was like...

3288
03:19:50,700 --> 03:19:51,060
Can I go?

3289
03:19:51,160 --> 03:19:51,600
Can I go?

3290
03:19:51,620 --> 03:19:52,700
I forgot something.

3291
03:19:52,860 --> 03:19:53,620
Can I go grab it?

3292
03:19:54,040 --> 03:19:55,980
In the middle of the concert.

3293
03:20:01,300 --> 03:20:02,860
It was so silly.

3294
03:20:06,600 --> 03:20:07,160
But...

3295
03:20:07,780 --> 03:20:09,680
That face you have when you went AFK.

3296
03:20:09,700 --> 03:20:10,140
I know.

3297
03:20:11,960 --> 03:20:13,680
For everybody to just see.

3298
03:20:14,340 --> 03:20:15,380
I'm embarrassing.

3299
03:20:19,100 --> 03:20:20,020
Gone fishing.

3300
03:20:20,300 --> 03:20:20,820
For real.

3301
03:20:21,040 --> 03:20:21,600
So...

3302
03:20:21,620 --> 03:20:22,100
But yeah.

3303
03:20:22,420 --> 03:20:22,820
And...

3304
03:20:23,840 --> 03:20:27,980
And then at the end, we did an encore, which...

3305
03:20:30,140 --> 03:20:31,420
It wasn't super...

3306
03:20:31,420 --> 03:20:38,200
It was kind of last minute where they asked me before if I wanted to do this with Bao.

3307
03:20:40,160 --> 03:20:41,080
And I said, sure.

3308
03:20:41,980 --> 03:20:46,180
Or rather, I said, I'm not sure because I didn't want to...

3309
03:20:46,180 --> 03:20:46,920
I didn't want to...

3310
03:20:46,920 --> 03:20:48,180
I didn't know if my throat would be okay.

3311
03:20:48,480 --> 03:20:51,600
So I was like, how soon do you need to do this?

3312
03:20:51,600 --> 03:20:51,980
And then she actually didn't need me to...

3313
03:20:51,980 --> 03:20:53,240
To tell you.

3314
03:20:53,340 --> 03:20:53,940
And they were like...

3315
03:20:53,940 --> 03:20:54,840
Ummm...

3316
03:20:55,560 --> 03:20:56,040
Like...

3317
03:20:56,540 --> 03:20:58,000
Maybe, like, a week before.

3318
03:20:58,360 --> 03:20:59,340
And I was like, okay.

3319
03:20:59,460 --> 03:20:59,760
I can...

3320
03:20:59,760 --> 03:21:01,360
I can see how my throat is.

3321
03:21:02,520 --> 03:21:04,460
I can see how my throat is.

3322
03:21:05,620 --> 03:21:06,100
Before...

3323
03:21:06,700 --> 03:21:07,640
In a week...

3324
03:21:07,640 --> 03:21:08,720
Like, well, the week before.

3325
03:21:10,660 --> 03:21:11,600
And then...

3326
03:21:12,600 --> 03:21:14,520
Everyone shouting she hates us was great.

3327
03:21:14,740 --> 03:21:15,920
It was so funny.

3328
03:21:17,220 --> 03:21:18,740
It was so funny.

3329
03:21:19,240 --> 03:21:20,380
And then we were...

3330
03:21:20,380 --> 03:21:20,760
We were...

3331
03:21:20,760 --> 03:21:21,280
We were...

3332
03:21:21,280 --> 03:21:24,240
We turned backstage and we were like heard everybody going USA, USA.

3333
03:21:24,660 --> 03:21:27,160
We were like, why is everybody saying that?

3334
03:21:32,820 --> 03:21:34,040
It was fun.

3335
03:21:34,140 --> 03:21:37,600
It was really fun to sing it with Bao.

3336
03:21:40,740 --> 03:21:43,320
And also none of us knew each other setlist.

3337
03:21:43,500 --> 03:21:44,280
So it was really neat.

3338
03:21:47,700 --> 03:21:51,120
Basically we were hearing everybody setlist for the first time too.

3339
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:53,540
Yeah, the USA mint flag.

3340
03:21:56,520 --> 03:21:59,060
I had my friend go and grab it for me.

3341
03:21:59,340 --> 03:22:01,980
And then she brought it backstage and I signed it.

3342
03:22:05,280 --> 03:22:06,280
So it was funny.

3343
03:22:10,020 --> 03:22:12,180
Speaking of setlist, can we see what they were?

3344
03:22:12,420 --> 03:22:12,920
For me?

3345
03:22:13,400 --> 03:22:14,340
Or for everybody?

3346
03:22:15,040 --> 03:22:16,920
Because I don't know what everybody's was.

3347
03:22:17,120 --> 03:22:17,680
I'm sorry.

3348
03:22:18,380 --> 03:22:19,600
But for me...

3349
03:22:21,280 --> 03:22:33,580
It was Love Deterrence, and then Ikenai Borderline, and then Stellar Stellar, and then Kahen Sanren Mix's Oboeru Uta, and then New Romantic Sailors.

3350
03:22:35,340 --> 03:22:43,540
That was the Stellar Stellar and the Kahen Sanren Mix song were the two songs I never sung before.

3351
03:22:45,360 --> 03:22:46,360
So it was really fun.

3352
03:22:46,460 --> 03:22:47,100
Yeah, there is a VOD.

3353
03:22:47,400 --> 03:22:50,120
Kristo uploaded a VOD.

3354
03:22:51,980 --> 03:22:54,260
On YouTube, so you can watch the whole concert.

3355
03:22:55,060 --> 03:22:57,340
Oh yeah, and then break stuff, of course.

3356
03:22:58,940 --> 03:23:00,560
Of course, of course, of course.

3357
03:23:05,820 --> 03:23:06,660
And um...

3358
03:23:07,250 --> 03:23:08,380
I was um...

3359
03:23:10,040 --> 03:23:11,920
Thank you, Misk!

3360
03:23:13,660 --> 03:23:15,060
Is that you, MiskInsanity?

3361
03:23:16,300 --> 03:23:17,100
Wasn't that AX?

3362
03:23:17,100 --> 03:23:18,960
But I saw some cool clips of Virtual Vacation on Twitter.

3363
03:23:19,080 --> 03:23:19,900
It looked like such a blast.

3364
03:23:20,340 --> 03:23:22,000
Hoping this is the first concert of many.

3365
03:23:22,200 --> 03:23:23,180
I hope so too!

3366
03:23:24,220 --> 03:23:25,100
I hope so too.

3367
03:23:27,580 --> 03:23:28,020
Um...

3368
03:23:29,840 --> 03:23:30,280
Uh...

3369
03:23:31,980 --> 03:23:35,160
Oh yeah, we were kind of nervous because like, you know, the...

3370
03:23:36,140 --> 03:23:37,640
The... I think...

3371
03:23:37,640 --> 03:23:41,260
The concert was announced first, but then like the...

3372
03:23:41,260 --> 03:23:43,080
There were so many things happening that night.

3373
03:23:43,140 --> 03:23:43,840
There was the...

3374
03:23:43,840 --> 03:23:45,660
The Dodgers game that was happening.

3375
03:23:45,900 --> 03:23:49,320
And then there was like some other concert that was happening that night.

3376
03:23:49,320 --> 03:23:51,240
And so we were just like, oh man...

3377
03:23:51,240 --> 03:23:53,240
Like us backstage, we were like...

3378
03:23:53,240 --> 03:23:54,360
You know, hopefully...

3379
03:23:54,360 --> 03:23:55,440
Like people...

3380
03:23:55,440 --> 03:23:56,300
You know...

3381
03:23:56,300 --> 03:24:01,440
And I felt bad because I was just like, oh there's probably people that got tickets for the concert but wanted to go to the...

3382
03:24:01,440 --> 03:24:02,440
To the Dodgers thing.

3383
03:24:02,460 --> 03:24:03,300
I kind of wanted to...

3384
03:24:03,300 --> 03:24:04,940
I wanted to go to the Dodgers game.

3385
03:24:05,980 --> 03:24:08,820
But I'm really glad people filmed it because it looked so cool.

3386
03:24:10,160 --> 03:24:11,240
Such a packed weekend.

3387
03:24:11,380 --> 03:24:11,660
It was!

3388
03:24:12,860 --> 03:24:13,900
It was uh...

3389
03:24:14,440 --> 03:24:15,220
But um...

3390
03:24:15,220 --> 03:24:17,600
The clips of the game looked so awesome.

3391
03:24:17,720 --> 03:24:18,540
Like with the...

3392
03:24:18,540 --> 03:24:19,480
The drone show.

3393
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:20,160
I wanted...

3394
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:22,400
I've never seen a drone show before.

3395
03:24:22,720 --> 03:24:23,760
I was like...

3396
03:24:24,540 --> 03:24:25,980
It's the coolest thing ever.

3397
03:24:27,340 --> 03:24:28,000
Yeah.

3398
03:24:30,340 --> 03:24:31,020
But...

3399
03:24:34,160 --> 03:24:34,840
So...

3400
03:24:35,360 --> 03:24:36,740
It was really cool that...

3401
03:24:36,740 --> 03:24:37,420
You know...

3402
03:24:37,420 --> 03:24:38,520
That happened.

3403
03:24:41,140 --> 03:24:42,540
The Drone Suisei.

3404
03:24:42,680 --> 03:24:43,860
There was Drone Suisei.

3405
03:24:43,900 --> 03:24:44,620
Drone Gura.

3406
03:24:44,780 --> 03:24:46,020
Drone Pekora.

3407
03:24:46,440 --> 03:24:47,620
They were all so awesome.

3408
03:24:48,900 --> 03:24:49,340
But...

3409
03:24:49,340 --> 03:24:50,060
Yeah.

3410
03:24:50,340 --> 03:24:51,620
I wanted to see the Dodgers game.

3411
03:24:51,720 --> 03:24:53,720
But I have zero regrets going to Virtual Vacation.

3412
03:24:53,920 --> 03:24:54,640
Thank you.

3413
03:24:55,380 --> 03:24:55,820
Yeah.

3414
03:24:56,100 --> 03:24:56,540
So...

3415
03:24:56,540 --> 03:24:56,960
Yippee!

3416
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:57,400
Krisu!

3417
03:25:00,400 --> 03:25:02,120
Thank you for filming everything!

3418
03:25:08,020 --> 03:25:08,460
Before...

3419
03:25:08,460 --> 03:25:09,740
Before the show...

3420
03:25:10,780 --> 03:25:12,640
When they picked me up from the airport...

3421
03:25:12,640 --> 03:25:14,880
One of the staff people was just like...

3422
03:25:16,960 --> 03:25:18,040
They were like...

3423
03:25:18,040 --> 03:25:18,580
Do you know Krisu?

3424
03:25:18,820 --> 03:25:19,680
And I was just like...

3425
03:25:19,680 --> 03:25:20,160
Oh yeah!

3426
03:25:20,640 --> 03:25:21,820
I've seen their clips before.

3427
03:25:21,820 --> 03:25:22,720
They were like...

3428
03:25:22,720 --> 03:25:24,480
They emailed us and asked if they could film.

3429
03:25:24,760 --> 03:25:26,060
And I was just like...

3430
03:25:26,060 --> 03:25:26,140
Oh!

3431
03:25:26,340 --> 03:25:26,820
Good.

3432
03:25:26,920 --> 03:25:27,980
Then there will be a...

3433
03:25:28,580 --> 03:25:30,300
There will be a...

3434
03:25:31,200 --> 03:25:34,880
A film of the concert.

3435
03:25:40,890 --> 03:25:42,350
There's a spider on the wall.

3436
03:25:45,920 --> 03:25:48,020
I think he noticed me looking at him.

3437
03:25:53,380 --> 03:25:54,720
He stopped walking.

3438
03:26:02,970 --> 03:26:03,790
He walked.

3439
03:26:10,360 --> 03:26:11,400
What was I saying?

3440
03:26:11,800 --> 03:26:12,960
Rain of spiders!

3441
03:26:16,180 --> 03:26:17,440
He's going to the maid dress.

3442
03:26:17,700 --> 03:26:19,480
Actually, I think he lives inside... Oh no!

3443
03:26:20,240 --> 03:26:21,520
There, he stopped again.

3444
03:26:22,420 --> 03:26:24,740
I'm not... I'll stop talking about you.

3445
03:26:24,860 --> 03:26:25,420
Get out of here.

3446
03:26:27,860 --> 03:26:29,720
He's not a big guy, he's a small guy.

3447
03:26:30,100 --> 03:26:31,340
It's my midnight snack.

3448
03:26:32,920 --> 03:26:33,380
Yummy.

3449
03:26:41,580 --> 03:26:42,500
Yeah, so...

3450
03:26:43,300 --> 03:26:44,680
So, you know...

3451
03:26:45,340 --> 03:26:47,140
If you had to pick one or the other...

3452
03:26:47,140 --> 03:26:48,900
For the concert or...

3453
03:26:48,900 --> 03:26:51,400
Or any of the other events...

3454
03:26:51,400 --> 03:26:52,280
That were happening...

3455
03:26:52,280 --> 03:26:55,520
In that weekend, that day, that Friday...

3456
03:26:55,520 --> 03:26:57,080
There was so much going on.

3457
03:26:57,300 --> 03:26:59,180
Thank you if you went to virtual vacations.

3458
03:26:59,740 --> 03:27:00,840
And if you didn't go...

3459
03:27:00,840 --> 03:27:02,500
I hope you enjoyed whatever event you went to.

3460
03:27:03,980 --> 03:27:05,900
And if you weren't at the event at all...

3461
03:27:05,900 --> 03:27:07,120
I hope you had a good weekend.

3462
03:27:09,480 --> 03:27:10,400
AX was so fun.

3463
03:27:10,640 --> 03:27:11,320
It was...

3464
03:27:12,240 --> 03:27:13,520
A little overwhelming.

3465
03:27:13,600 --> 03:27:15,780
It was kind of me being like...

3466
03:27:15,780 --> 03:27:17,600
I'm going to walk around for a little bit.

3467
03:27:17,900 --> 03:27:19,440
And then...

3468
03:27:19,440 --> 03:27:21,120
Oh, I have to meet with people.

3469
03:27:21,420 --> 03:27:22,540
Oh, I have to meet with people.

3470
03:27:22,800 --> 03:27:25,340
Oh, I'm meeting with this person.

3471
03:27:25,480 --> 03:27:26,620
Oh, I'm meeting with this person.

3472
03:27:26,620 --> 03:27:27,700
Blue Archive booth.

3473
03:27:27,940 --> 03:27:29,080
I'm meeting with this person.

3474
03:27:29,240 --> 03:27:30,440
I'm going to meet with this person.

3475
03:27:31,980 --> 03:27:33,000
Blue Archive booth.

3476
03:27:33,220 --> 03:27:34,500
I'm going to meet with this person.

3477
03:27:36,920 --> 03:27:37,280
So...

3478
03:27:38,440 --> 03:27:40,140
Did you end up talking to Sumidae?

3479
03:27:40,740 --> 03:27:41,100
No.

3480
03:27:41,960 --> 03:27:43,000
I don't think I would...

3481
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:44,920
Even if I had recognized her right off the bat...

3482
03:27:44,920 --> 03:27:46,420
I wouldn't have either because...

3483
03:27:46,900 --> 03:27:48,900
I saw her in the industry lounge.

3484
03:27:49,040 --> 03:27:52,040
And that's kind of where people go to...

3485
03:27:53,020 --> 03:27:53,740
Like... relax.

3486
03:27:53,740 --> 03:27:56,040
I saw her staff...

3487
03:27:56,040 --> 03:27:57,740
Taking pictures of her.

3488
03:27:57,900 --> 03:27:59,220
She was holding something up...

3489
03:27:59,220 --> 03:28:00,360
And they were taking pictures of her.

3490
03:28:00,660 --> 03:28:01,540
In fact, I should...

3491
03:28:01,540 --> 03:28:02,820
Wait, does she have a Twitter?

3492
03:28:05,740 --> 03:28:08,020
I should see if they posted it.

3493
03:28:08,300 --> 03:28:10,480
I should see if they posted it.

3494
03:28:10,660 --> 03:28:12,240
Did not have interactions so much.

3495
03:28:12,300 --> 03:28:13,900
Yeah, so I would have left her alone.

3496
03:28:14,060 --> 03:28:15,020
But I definitely was staring.

3497
03:28:15,160 --> 03:28:15,700
I was like...

3498
03:28:16,640 --> 03:28:17,520
Who is that?

3499
03:28:18,520 --> 03:28:19,440
Who is that?

3500
03:28:20,060 --> 03:28:20,940
Who is that?

3501
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:24,700
And then...

3502
03:28:25,440 --> 03:28:26,180
And then...

3503
03:28:27,220 --> 03:28:28,020
It dawned.

3504
03:28:30,520 --> 03:28:31,320
Uesaka Sumidae...

3505
03:28:32,160 --> 03:28:32,860
In my...

3506
03:28:32,860 --> 03:28:34,380
Actually, it's so funny because...

3507
03:28:34,840 --> 03:28:35,240
Well...

3508
03:28:37,820 --> 03:28:38,840
Actually, I can't say that.

3509
03:28:38,900 --> 03:28:39,240
I'm sorry.

3510
03:28:43,820 --> 03:28:45,120
Actually, I can say this.

3511
03:28:45,240 --> 03:28:45,840
I can say this.

3512
03:28:49,580 --> 03:28:51,940
Someone I know was walking with her as well.

3513
03:28:52,320 --> 03:28:53,480
And they waved at me.

3514
03:28:53,960 --> 03:28:55,140
And I was just like... Oh, hello!

3515
03:28:56,740 --> 03:28:57,260
And...

3516
03:28:57,260 --> 03:28:59,900
I was in the industry room to meet with someone too.

3517
03:29:00,100 --> 03:29:00,420
So...

3518
03:29:02,020 --> 03:29:03,780
So, my friend waved at me.

3519
03:29:04,960 --> 03:29:05,480
And...

3520
03:29:08,320 --> 03:29:08,840
And...

3521
03:29:08,840 --> 03:29:12,340
It made her look at me too.

3522
03:29:13,980 --> 03:29:15,380
So I was like...

3523
03:29:17,140 --> 03:29:17,660
Now...

3524
03:29:17,660 --> 03:29:18,600
Now I'm like...

3525
03:29:18,600 --> 03:29:19,540
Doki!

3526
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:24,460
Maybe she can see ghosts.

3527
03:29:24,680 --> 03:29:25,320
A little bit.

3528
03:29:26,160 --> 03:29:27,220
Maybe she sensed my presence.

3529
03:29:33,200 --> 03:29:35,580
But no, there were so many people.

3530
03:29:35,700 --> 03:29:37,340
And so much life force to suck.

3531
03:29:37,520 --> 03:29:39,000
So it was just kind of like...

3532
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:40,220
So much energy.

3533
03:29:40,260 --> 03:29:42,300
I basically became physical for the weekend.

3534
03:29:42,640 --> 03:29:43,120
Almost.

3535
03:29:44,320 --> 03:29:46,000
I think you could probably see me.

3536
03:29:46,120 --> 03:29:46,600
Maybe.

3537
03:29:46,720 --> 03:29:47,160
I don't know.

3538
03:29:48,740 --> 03:29:49,700
Doki mentioned...

3539
03:29:49,700 --> 03:29:52,400
No, my heart went to Doki.

3540
03:29:57,710 --> 03:29:58,210
Suck.

3541
03:29:59,290 --> 03:30:00,090
There I go.

3542
03:30:02,310 --> 03:30:03,670
Delicious life force.

3543
03:30:12,110 --> 03:30:14,710
Do you have a plan to open up a P.O.

3544
03:30:14,750 --> 03:30:14,970
box?

3545
03:30:17,530 --> 03:30:18,530
Do you have a plan to open up a P.O.

3546
03:30:18,530 --> 03:30:18,530
box?

3547
03:30:18,530 --> 03:30:19,110
Not right now.

3548
03:30:19,290 --> 03:30:19,810
I'm sorry.

3549
03:30:21,490 --> 03:30:22,850
I don't really have a...

3550
03:30:22,850 --> 03:30:25,070
Good way to get one.

3551
03:30:25,910 --> 03:30:27,430
But maybe in the future.

3552
03:30:27,630 --> 03:30:28,770
I can have...

3553
03:30:28,770 --> 03:30:30,030
Some way.

3554
03:30:30,350 --> 03:30:31,170
For that.

3555
03:30:36,470 --> 03:30:39,230
Any plans you were able to make at AX through network?

3556
03:30:42,070 --> 03:30:44,190
It's kind of hard because...

3557
03:30:44,910 --> 03:30:46,410
I met like...

3558
03:30:47,350 --> 03:30:49,450
Some people that I met in the past.

3559
03:30:50,650 --> 03:30:51,850
Like in the industry.

3560
03:30:52,110 --> 03:30:52,690
But...

3561
03:30:53,630 --> 03:30:55,590
It was kind of weird to be...

3562
03:30:55,590 --> 03:30:56,750
To like kind of you know...

3563
03:30:56,750 --> 03:30:57,550
Go up to...

3564
03:30:58,250 --> 03:30:59,570
Some people and be like...

3565
03:30:59,570 --> 03:31:00,450
Hi, I'm a ghost.

3566
03:31:01,790 --> 03:31:03,610
Would you like to work with a ghost?

3567
03:31:06,250 --> 03:31:06,770
Though...

3568
03:31:06,770 --> 03:31:09,190
Actually the only people I really talked to...

3569
03:31:09,190 --> 03:31:11,030
Was the blue archive booth.

3570
03:31:11,270 --> 03:31:11,710
But...

3571
03:31:11,710 --> 03:31:13,050
We'll see what happens.

3572
03:31:14,870 --> 03:31:15,690
Not that...

3573
03:31:15,690 --> 03:31:18,150
I'm not like super talking with you know.

3574
03:31:18,230 --> 03:31:19,830
But I just kind of introduced myself.

3575
03:31:23,250 --> 03:31:25,870
Got the information wrong about the game.

3576
03:31:26,050 --> 03:31:27,530
It's five dollars not four.

3577
03:31:27,730 --> 03:31:28,270
Oh it's okay.

3578
03:31:32,880 --> 03:31:33,700
I'm ghost.

3579
03:31:34,520 --> 03:31:36,280
When I was like I'm ghost.

3580
03:31:36,620 --> 03:31:38,220
They're like you're ghost Vtuber?

3581
03:31:38,380 --> 03:31:38,860
I was like...

3582
03:31:42,200 --> 03:31:43,040
I'm ghost.

3583
03:31:43,100 --> 03:31:43,780
I'm ghost.

3584
03:31:43,960 --> 03:31:45,040
I'm ghost Vtuber.

3585
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:46,020
Uh huh.

3586
03:31:46,140 --> 03:31:46,660
Uh huh.

3587
03:31:52,660 --> 03:31:54,100
Maybe one day.

3588
03:31:54,860 --> 03:31:55,700
Fingies crossed.

3589
03:31:58,660 --> 03:32:00,540
But other than that...

3590
03:32:00,540 --> 03:32:02,760
It was so much more...

3591
03:32:02,760 --> 03:32:04,640
Meeting with like other things too.

3592
03:32:05,600 --> 03:32:07,120
But some cool stuff...

3593
03:32:07,120 --> 03:32:07,580
Is cooking.

3594
03:32:07,880 --> 03:32:08,700
I think.

3595
03:32:09,300 --> 03:32:09,900
So...

3596
03:32:09,900 --> 03:32:11,300
I'm trying.

3597
03:32:11,640 --> 03:32:13,180
I've been kind of feeling frustrated.

3598
03:32:13,540 --> 03:32:14,080
A little bit.

3599
03:32:14,120 --> 03:32:14,720
Well not frustrated.

3600
03:32:15,040 --> 03:32:15,400
Like...

3601
03:32:17,420 --> 03:32:19,080
It kind of goes back to...

3602
03:32:19,880 --> 03:32:21,340
Why I was frustrated...

3603
03:32:21,340 --> 03:32:22,340
At the beginning of the stream.

3604
03:32:22,680 --> 03:32:23,140
Because...

3605
03:32:26,600 --> 03:32:27,520
Sometimes like...

3606
03:32:27,520 --> 03:32:28,380
Uh...

3607
03:32:29,010 --> 03:32:30,000
I'll be offered things.

3608
03:32:30,880 --> 03:32:33,260
But I can't accept them.

3609
03:32:33,320 --> 03:32:34,000
Because I'm...

3610
03:32:35,100 --> 03:32:36,360
Waiting on other stuff.

3611
03:32:36,540 --> 03:32:38,700
And so it feels like I'm just kind of stuck in...

3612
03:32:38,700 --> 03:32:39,880
I mean I'm a ghost.

3613
03:32:39,900 --> 03:32:41,440
I'm always stuck in limbo.

3614
03:32:41,500 --> 03:32:42,940
But now I'm stuck in limbo...

3615
03:32:42,940 --> 03:32:44,300
With this as well.

3616
03:32:45,040 --> 03:32:46,180
So it's kind of like...

3617
03:32:46,920 --> 03:32:47,460
Mmm...

3618
03:32:47,460 --> 03:32:50,460
It feels frustrating because it feels like I...

3619
03:32:51,040 --> 03:32:52,000
Can't get...

3620
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:53,600
I can't do what I want to do.

3621
03:32:53,760 --> 03:32:56,820
And I'm having to turn down other things because of...

3622
03:32:58,080 --> 03:32:59,100
Having to...

3623
03:32:59,100 --> 03:32:59,860
Wait.

3624
03:33:00,820 --> 03:33:03,000
And so it's just been a little...

3625
03:33:04,980 --> 03:33:05,520
Frustrating.

3626
03:33:06,340 --> 03:33:08,280
And it's kind of of my own making.

3627
03:33:10,400 --> 03:33:11,920
Sorry I'm being so vague.

3628
03:33:13,080 --> 03:33:13,620
But...

3629
03:33:15,040 --> 03:33:16,460
I don't want to spoil stuff.

3630
03:33:18,480 --> 03:33:19,500
So it's...

3631
03:33:20,100 --> 03:33:21,040
Stalled and blocked.

3632
03:33:21,060 --> 03:33:21,660
It's frustrating.

3633
03:33:23,280 --> 03:33:23,800
Yeah...

3634
03:33:23,800 --> 03:33:25,120
Because it's like...

3635
03:33:25,120 --> 03:33:26,920
People will be like, do you want to do this?

3636
03:33:27,500 --> 03:33:28,520
And I'm like, yes!

3637
03:33:28,820 --> 03:33:29,440
I do!

3638
03:33:30,260 --> 03:33:31,580
But I can't right now!

3639
03:33:32,420 --> 03:33:33,720
And so I'm...

3640
03:33:34,980 --> 03:33:36,680
Trying to figure out how I...

3641
03:33:37,680 --> 03:33:38,680
Can do stuff.

3642
03:33:38,760 --> 03:33:40,680
Because I don't want to keep...

3643
03:33:41,840 --> 03:33:43,000
Turning down stuff.

3644
03:33:43,040 --> 03:33:43,440
I don't know.

3645
03:33:51,340 --> 03:33:53,000
It's a good problem to have to say.

3646
03:33:53,060 --> 03:33:53,800
At the very least.

3647
03:33:53,920 --> 03:33:54,800
Yeah, I guess that's fair.

3648
03:33:56,100 --> 03:33:58,140
It's better to get stuff than not get stuff.

3649
03:33:58,280 --> 03:33:58,820
That's so true.

3650
03:34:02,240 --> 03:34:03,900
But I think once...

3651
03:34:05,520 --> 03:34:07,080
Once I'm able to finally...

3652
03:34:08,860 --> 03:34:09,300
Progress...

3653
03:34:09,300 --> 03:34:10,420
You'll understand.

3654
03:34:10,600 --> 03:34:12,380
Then I can kind of explain...

3655
03:34:12,380 --> 03:34:13,480
In better detail.

3656
03:34:13,680 --> 03:34:16,240
And you'll probably understand better why...

3657
03:34:17,600 --> 03:34:18,640
It's been a little...

3658
03:34:18,640 --> 03:34:19,340
Slow for me.

3659
03:34:21,280 --> 03:34:21,740
So...

3660
03:34:22,480 --> 03:34:23,360
Don't get me wrong.

3661
03:34:23,440 --> 03:34:24,840
There's lots that I want to do.

3662
03:34:24,980 --> 03:34:26,920
I'm just waiting on other people.

3663
03:34:28,180 --> 03:34:29,300
And other things.

3664
03:34:30,300 --> 03:34:30,760
So...

3665
03:34:31,720 --> 03:34:34,060
That's what's been the hold up.

3666
03:34:34,300 --> 03:34:35,140
On stuff.

3667
03:34:36,720 --> 03:34:37,180
Hmm...

3668
03:34:42,860 --> 03:34:43,720
So, you know.

3669
03:34:48,520 --> 03:34:49,640
What has been slow?

3670
03:34:49,860 --> 03:34:50,840
What are you talking about?

3671
03:34:50,900 --> 03:34:51,920
What are you talking about?

3672
03:34:52,020 --> 03:34:52,600
What do you mean?

3673
03:34:53,340 --> 03:34:54,280
For me...

3674
03:34:54,280 --> 03:34:55,360
I feel slow.

3675
03:35:42,320 --> 03:35:42,900
Sorry.

3676
03:35:52,420 --> 03:35:53,720
I'm trying not...

3677
03:35:55,280 --> 03:35:57,040
For you to know that I'm...

3678
03:35:59,200 --> 03:36:01,380
I don't want you to tell that I'm crying.

3679
03:36:18,270 --> 03:36:19,310
How do you know?

3680
03:37:19,770 --> 03:37:20,890
Sorry for...

3681
03:37:22,830 --> 03:37:24,270
Being such a downer.

3682
03:37:24,270 --> 03:37:25,130
At the end of the stream.

3683
03:37:50,390 --> 03:37:52,890
I just don't want to disappoint...

3684
03:37:53,570 --> 03:37:54,210
You guys.

3685
03:37:54,510 --> 03:37:54,970
So...

3686
03:37:56,370 --> 03:37:57,450
Then I...

3687
03:38:09,420 --> 03:38:10,000
I don't know.

3688
03:38:10,180 --> 03:38:11,120
You know I...

3689
03:38:13,740 --> 03:38:15,200
Kind of was like...

3690
03:38:15,200 --> 03:38:16,860
For a while now.

3691
03:38:17,720 --> 03:38:18,760
For like...

3692
03:38:18,760 --> 03:38:19,880
I don't know.

3693
03:38:19,880 --> 03:38:22,140
Well I mean I've only been around...

3694
03:38:22,140 --> 03:38:23,280
Back since like...

3695
03:38:23,920 --> 03:38:25,740
For a couple months but...

3696
03:38:25,740 --> 03:38:26,780
You know.

3697
03:38:27,940 --> 03:38:29,580
Even still I just...

3698
03:38:29,580 --> 03:38:31,440
Wonder if...

3699
03:38:33,160 --> 03:38:35,380
I'm ever doing a good job or not.

3700
03:38:42,060 --> 03:38:42,660
So...

3701
03:38:50,280 --> 03:38:52,100
Because you know after...

3702
03:38:53,040 --> 03:38:54,280
Heaven and all like...

3703
03:38:54,280 --> 03:38:55,020
You know it's...

3704
03:38:57,320 --> 03:38:58,480
I thought I might...

3705
03:38:58,480 --> 03:38:59,700
Give it all up and...

3706
03:39:05,400 --> 03:39:06,480
So I want to...

3707
03:39:06,480 --> 03:39:07,660
Make sure that if I...

3708
03:39:08,320 --> 03:39:10,340
Am back now and have the chance...

3709
03:39:10,340 --> 03:39:11,380
I want to do it properly.

3710
03:39:13,100 --> 03:39:14,520
And do a good job.

3711
03:39:17,160 --> 03:39:17,640
So...

3712
03:39:19,720 --> 03:39:20,320
That's all.

3713
03:39:21,220 --> 03:39:22,100
It's just been...

3714
03:39:22,100 --> 03:39:22,800
Bugging me.

3715
03:39:24,860 --> 03:39:26,160
For a little while.

3716
03:39:46,680 --> 03:39:47,280
But...

3717
03:39:47,280 --> 03:39:48,100
You know.

3718
03:39:49,820 --> 03:39:51,020
I also...

3719
03:39:51,980 --> 03:39:53,820
Use this to keep me motivated.

3720
03:39:55,560 --> 03:39:56,320
You know.

3721
03:39:56,440 --> 03:39:57,940
You know I'm too stubborn.

3722
03:39:58,700 --> 03:40:00,320
When I feel like...

3723
03:40:01,560 --> 03:40:03,400
If I'm not doing a good job...

3724
03:40:03,400 --> 03:40:04,000
It makes me...

3725
03:40:04,000 --> 03:40:05,320
Be like...

3726
03:40:05,320 --> 03:40:06,180
Yeah well...

3727
03:40:06,180 --> 03:40:07,440
Do a better job.

3728
03:40:07,460 --> 03:40:07,800
Dummy.

3729
03:40:07,900 --> 03:40:08,280
So...

3730
03:40:24,200 --> 03:40:24,840
That's it.

3731
03:40:24,840 --> 03:40:25,320
So...

3732
03:40:25,320 --> 03:40:28,400
Thank you guys.

3733
03:40:28,600 --> 03:40:29,840
For your nice words.

3734
03:40:29,940 --> 03:40:30,940
I appreciate it.

3735
03:40:49,420 --> 03:40:50,060
Anyway...

3736
03:40:51,580 --> 03:40:53,100
I try not to...

3737
03:40:53,440 --> 03:40:55,460
Talk about this kind of stuff.

3738
03:40:55,840 --> 03:40:56,480
Because...

3739
03:40:59,320 --> 03:41:01,260
It's only stuff I should worry about.

3740
03:41:02,220 --> 03:41:04,120
It's only stuff I should worry about.

3741
03:41:04,300 --> 03:41:04,960
It's all.

3742
03:41:11,420 --> 03:41:12,540
Thank you.

3743
03:41:14,040 --> 03:41:14,600
Next...

3744
03:41:14,600 --> 03:41:15,380
Thank you for the...

3745
03:41:18,440 --> 03:41:19,240
Don't worry.

3746
03:41:19,340 --> 03:41:20,240
Do what makes you happy.

3747
03:41:20,900 --> 03:41:21,760
Thank you.

3748
03:41:27,360 --> 03:41:27,920
Sorry.

3749
03:41:28,580 --> 03:41:29,920
My nose is all...

3750
03:41:29,920 --> 03:41:30,860
Stuffed now.

3751
03:41:31,900 --> 03:41:33,160
And you're gonna be like...

3752
03:41:35,360 --> 03:41:36,880
I already know.

3753
03:41:50,520 --> 03:41:52,780
I already know.

3754
03:41:53,220 --> 03:41:53,240
Already nose.

3755
03:41:53,280 --> 03:41:54,200
Nose.

3756
03:41:55,180 --> 03:41:56,100
Nose.

3757
03:42:06,760 --> 03:42:07,680
But...

3758
03:42:09,460 --> 03:42:12,000
I will keep working harder.

3759
03:42:15,340 --> 03:42:15,800
Yeah.

3760
03:42:20,080 --> 03:42:20,640
So...

3761
03:42:21,460 --> 03:42:23,520
And I will be patient.

3762
03:42:24,840 --> 03:42:25,960
I will be...

3763
03:42:25,960 --> 03:42:27,760
I will be patient.

3764
03:42:28,140 --> 03:42:29,360
And keep waiting.

3765
03:42:30,260 --> 03:42:30,820
Hopefully.

3766
03:42:31,120 --> 03:42:33,420
But I am cooking up some fun stuff I think.

3767
03:42:33,680 --> 03:42:35,020
Again it's just...

3768
03:42:36,360 --> 03:42:37,360
Some of the waiting.

3769
03:42:37,560 --> 03:42:38,700
It's also just you know...

3770
03:42:38,700 --> 03:42:39,660
Like I said.

3771
03:42:39,980 --> 03:42:41,800
It's frustrating to be like...

3772
03:42:41,800 --> 03:42:43,780
I can't do something because I'm waiting.

3773
03:42:44,120 --> 03:42:45,380
It's like the worst feeling.

3774
03:42:47,140 --> 03:42:48,840
Not being able to do something...

3775
03:42:48,840 --> 03:42:49,700
Cool or fun.

3776
03:42:49,880 --> 03:42:50,720
Because you have to wait.

3777
03:42:57,340 --> 03:42:59,020
Even if you were a grocer.

3778
03:43:01,280 --> 03:43:03,300
Maybe I should have gone to be a grocer.

3779
03:43:03,640 --> 03:43:05,060
Would have been way less pressure.

3780
03:43:08,640 --> 03:43:09,420
Thank you.

3781
03:43:10,740 --> 03:43:11,440
Thank you.

3782
03:43:16,960 --> 03:43:17,560
No.

3783
03:43:18,260 --> 03:43:19,600
Not you'd hate it.

3784
03:43:19,800 --> 03:43:21,000
I've done it before.

3785
03:43:22,980 --> 03:43:24,120
I've done it before.

3786
03:43:24,540 --> 03:43:24,660
I've done it before.

3787
03:43:25,360 --> 03:43:28,440
Probably it would be more pressure on my wallet though.

3788
03:43:30,860 --> 03:43:31,460
Probably it would be more pressure on my wallet though.

3789
03:43:31,460 --> 03:43:33,080
More pressure on my wallet probably.

3790
03:43:33,660 --> 03:43:33,800
More pressure on my wallet probably.

3791
03:43:35,980 --> 03:43:37,680
I hate retail so much.

3792
03:43:37,760 --> 03:43:38,320
I know.

3793
03:43:41,800 --> 03:43:42,400
Customers.

3794
03:43:42,420 --> 03:43:44,380
The customer is not always right.

3795
03:43:46,540 --> 03:43:48,640
How would you buy all the MGS merch?

3796
03:43:50,540 --> 03:43:52,200
You have expensive hobbies.

3797
03:43:52,340 --> 03:43:53,040
I know.

3798
03:43:58,260 --> 03:43:59,580
But it's okay.

3799
03:43:59,740 --> 03:44:01,380
I've given up my hobbies before.

3800
03:44:08,740 --> 03:44:09,640
And then...

3801
03:44:09,640 --> 03:44:10,160
You know.

3802
03:44:10,800 --> 03:44:12,700
For all the retailers.

3803
03:44:12,820 --> 03:44:14,700
All the office workers in the world.

3804
03:44:15,780 --> 03:44:17,400
You can watch my streams.

3805
03:44:17,560 --> 03:44:18,200
And hopefully...

3806
03:44:18,200 --> 03:44:20,040
You can feel better.

3807
03:44:20,580 --> 03:44:22,380
And decompress after a day.

3808
03:44:23,040 --> 03:44:24,740
And I can relate to your struggles.

3809
03:44:26,160 --> 03:44:28,220
I can relate too much.

3810
03:44:34,430 --> 03:44:36,210
My co-workers are the worst part.

3811
03:44:36,650 --> 03:44:37,370
No way.

3812
03:44:39,090 --> 03:44:40,610
That's not supposed to be the worst part.

3813
03:44:40,730 --> 03:44:42,470
It's supposed to be the customers that are the worst part.

3814
03:44:48,200 --> 03:44:49,080
Office workers.

3815
03:44:49,300 --> 03:44:50,000
Survivor Mito.

3816
03:44:51,780 --> 03:44:52,620
I got you.

3817
03:44:56,360 --> 03:44:57,660
Sometimes it's both.

3818
03:44:57,760 --> 03:44:58,680
Yeah, sometimes.

3819
03:44:59,820 --> 03:45:00,300
Alrighty.

3820
03:45:00,820 --> 03:45:02,400
I think I'm gonna go to bed now.

3821
03:45:03,440 --> 03:45:03,920
Honestly...

3822
03:45:05,380 --> 03:45:07,260
I have no idea what I'm doing this week.

3823
03:45:12,060 --> 03:45:14,340
I don't really know what I'm doing this week.

3824
03:45:14,520 --> 03:45:15,000
But...

3825
03:45:16,380 --> 03:45:18,440
There will be a stream this week.

3826
03:45:18,560 --> 03:45:19,120
Tomorrow too.

3827
03:45:20,720 --> 03:45:21,160
Shady.

3828
03:45:21,500 --> 03:45:22,140
I'm sorry.

3829
03:45:22,280 --> 03:45:22,960
I killed you.

3830
03:45:24,420 --> 03:45:25,020
Much love.

3831
03:45:25,100 --> 03:45:26,420
It's always a fun time when you stream.

3832
03:45:26,600 --> 03:45:26,880
Thank you.

3833
03:45:31,580 --> 03:45:32,020
Boons.

3834
03:45:32,120 --> 03:45:32,340
No.

3835
03:45:36,000 --> 03:45:36,880
No, Boons.

3836
03:45:38,480 --> 03:45:40,060
Love watching your streams after work.

3837
03:45:40,160 --> 03:45:40,740
Thank you.

3838
03:45:40,900 --> 03:45:41,740
Thank you guys.

3839
03:45:42,160 --> 03:45:44,500
And VOD watchers and lurkers.

3840
03:45:44,680 --> 03:45:45,260
Thank you guys.

3841
03:45:46,060 --> 03:45:46,500
Hello.

3842
03:45:47,000 --> 03:45:48,040
If you're watching.

3843
03:45:48,120 --> 03:45:48,880
If you got this far.

3844
03:45:51,980 --> 03:45:53,440
I really enjoyed your streams.

3845
03:45:53,540 --> 03:45:55,560
And the fact that you enjoy a lot of the same things I do.

3846
03:45:55,600 --> 03:45:56,420
Keep doing amazing things.

3847
03:45:56,560 --> 03:45:57,080
Thank you.

3848
03:46:00,080 --> 03:46:00,520
Okay.

3849
03:46:04,580 --> 03:46:05,420
Let's bust in.

3850
03:46:05,540 --> 03:46:06,840
Let's get rid of the sad music.

3851
03:46:08,180 --> 03:46:09,040
No more sad.

3852
03:46:09,300 --> 03:46:09,980
No more sad.

3853
03:46:12,700 --> 03:46:14,340
Tomorrow I'll do lots of work.

3854
03:46:16,320 --> 03:46:16,680
Where?

3855
03:46:16,860 --> 03:46:17,520
Oh, bust in.

3856
03:46:18,920 --> 03:46:19,640
Bust in.

3857
03:46:23,640 --> 03:46:25,280
Do you think it's going to be too loud?

3858
03:46:25,460 --> 03:46:26,240
Let me turn it down.

3859
03:46:26,500 --> 03:46:26,860
Sure.

3860
03:46:38,320 --> 03:46:42,480
Is it too low?

3861
03:46:45,320 --> 03:46:47,040
I don't want to get caught by the coffee.

3862
03:46:47,180 --> 03:46:47,280
Right?

3863
03:46:50,580 --> 03:46:52,120
Let me tell you something.

3864
03:46:53,220 --> 03:46:54,640
There's something weird.

3865
03:46:55,220 --> 03:46:56,520
Sleeping in your bed.

3866
03:46:57,140 --> 03:46:57,500
Ow.

3867
03:46:57,760 --> 03:46:58,620
Let me tell you something.

3868
03:46:59,500 --> 03:46:59,980
Ow.

3869
03:47:00,240 --> 03:47:04,820
I got the part wrong.

3870
03:47:05,920 --> 03:47:06,700
Bust in.

3871
03:47:06,800 --> 03:47:07,240
Bust in.

3872
03:47:07,280 --> 03:47:07,840
Bust in.

3873
03:47:07,860 --> 03:47:08,320
Bust in.

3874
03:47:08,320 --> 03:47:08,780
Bust in.

3875
03:47:08,840 --> 03:47:09,340
Bust in.

3876
03:47:17,660 --> 03:47:18,860
Bust in.

3877
03:47:25,600 --> 03:47:28,160
If you're seeing things.

3878
03:47:28,400 --> 03:47:29,960
Sleeping in your bed.

3879
03:47:32,200 --> 03:47:32,820
Yeah.

3880
03:47:33,420 --> 03:47:34,220
Yeah.

3881
03:47:34,300 --> 03:47:34,740
Yeah.

3882
03:47:34,740 --> 03:47:36,220
An invisible man.

3883
03:47:36,760 --> 03:47:38,360
Sleeping in your bed.

3884
03:47:39,000 --> 03:47:39,380
Ow.

3885
03:47:39,680 --> 03:47:40,620
Let me tell you something.

3886
03:47:41,320 --> 03:47:41,720
Ow.

3887
03:47:42,200 --> 03:47:42,940
Yeah.

3888
03:47:42,940 --> 03:47:43,040
Yeah.

3889
03:47:44,500 --> 03:47:45,440
Bust in.

3890
03:47:45,520 --> 03:47:46,020
Bust in.

3891
03:47:46,020 --> 03:47:46,540
Bust in.

3892
03:47:46,540 --> 03:47:47,480
Bust in.

3893
03:47:51,340 --> 03:47:52,920
Makes me feel good.

3894
03:47:53,200 --> 03:47:53,980
Feel good.

3895
03:47:54,240 --> 03:47:54,980
Feel good.

3896
03:47:58,240 --> 03:47:58,660
Yeah.

3897
03:47:59,580 --> 03:48:00,300
Yeah.

3898
03:48:01,740 --> 03:48:02,460
Feel

3899
03:48:09,980 --> 03:48:10,700
good.

3900
03:48:11,020 --> 03:48:11,680
Feel good.

3901
03:48:11,940 --> 03:48:13,700
Feel good.

3902
03:48:16,600 --> 03:48:21,300
Get ghost read.

3903
03:48:23,340 --> 03:48:24,080
Get ghost read.

3904
03:48:24,080 --> 03:48:25,580
Freaky ghost man.

3905
03:48:27,220 --> 03:48:27,960
Freaky

3906
03:48:35,660 --> 03:48:35,660
ghost man.

3907
03:48:35,660 --> 03:48:37,020
Let me sleep in your bed.

3908
03:48:38,840 --> 03:48:39,580
Let me sleep in your bed.

3909
03:48:40,740 --> 03:48:41,480
Phew.

3910
03:48:42,160 --> 03:48:43,520
Let me tell you something.

3911
03:48:44,650 --> 03:48:46,200
Sleeping makes me feel good.

3912
03:48:46,700 --> 03:48:47,220
Sleeping makes me feel good.

3913
03:48:50,530 --> 03:48:52,210
I'm afraid of no sleep.

3914
03:48:52,610 --> 03:48:54,230
I'm afraid of no bed.

3915
03:48:55,530 --> 03:49:00,130
