00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,580
Oh, okay.

24
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,820
I studied English yesterday.

25
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,860
Okay.

26
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,860
Let's do it.

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,500
Hi, hi, hi.

00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,140
Everyone, hi.

00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,100

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,740

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,460
And I'm a YouTuber.

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,400
Yes, you know me.

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:41,820

00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,480
Social distance.

00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,160
Please, social distance.

41
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,760
Yes, I'm sorry.

42
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,980

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,280
And my hobby is stocking mint.

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,720

45
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,280

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,300
Yes, mint.

47
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,620
Yes, yes, yes.

48
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,060
And I'm not good at English.

49
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,300
Sorry, sorry.

50
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,900
But try using English today.

51
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,740
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

52
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,260
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

53
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,780
I'm good.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,560
How about my English?

55
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,740
Oh, my God.

56
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Perfect.

57
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,400
Perfect.

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,880
Oh, thank you, thank you.

59
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,440
I heard sometimes, oh, one years old English.

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,420
Oh, thank you.

62
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,980
But that's charm point.

63
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,800
Charm point.

64
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,220
Oh, really?

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,760
Yeah.

66
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,440
Charming Ayami.

67
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,340
Okay, thank you.

68
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:55,940
Yes.

69
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,520
So, this weekend, Ayami-sensei will be coming to America.

70
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,240
America.

71
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,740
Where is America?

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,360
Too far.

73
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,320
Too far.

74
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,080
You can swim.

75
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,560
Tired.

76
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,260
Because I'm 2100 years old, and I cannot swim.

77
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,840
Using plane, flight.

78
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,080
Oh, okay.

79
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,960
Too far.

80
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,700
But, but, but, but.

81
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,500
I can swim.

82
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,760
I have been to Hawaii, family trip.

83
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:50,200
But I have never been to the real United States.

84
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,180
Are you nervous?

85
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,480
What is real USA?

86
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,140
Real USA.

87
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,800
Today we will learn real USA.

88
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,100
USA.

89
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,140
USA.

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,960
Is there a real USA?

91
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,900
Do you live in the United States?

92
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,960
I don't think so.

93
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,740
Is it only the news?

94
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,660
Yes.

95
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,320
It's like an AI video.

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,600
I see.

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
What should I do?

98
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,120
What should I do?

99
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm scared.

100
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,200
Mint, do you really stay in America?

101
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,420
Where are you?

102
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,300
Me?

103
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,620
I'm in America.

104
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,820
Real America.

105
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,180
You are in Japan, isn't it?

106
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,500
Isn't it?

107
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:59,840
Because when Ayami contact to you and message, I think you always...

108
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,460
Sorry.

109
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm now in Japan.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,380
You always stay.

111
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,500
Again?

112
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,460
Again in Japan?

113
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,400
Let's play.

114
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,020
Again.

115
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,980
In the next month.

116
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,300
That's right.

117
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,240
Welcome.

118
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,480
Welcome to Japan.

119
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:21,980
Let's play.

120
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Let's hang out.

121
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,160
I was thinking that Mint doesn't live in America.

122
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,600
I think you live in Japan almost.

123
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,000
My feeling is that.

124
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,500
And you live in my heart.

125
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,420
Yes.

126
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,540
I love you.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,540
I live in your closet.

128
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,320
I'm scared.

129
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:46,700
I'm scared.

130
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,940
You are scared?

131
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,120
Are you scared?

132
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,600
I was surprised.

133
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,240
I was surprised.

134
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,300
Wow.

135
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,260
Oh, that's right.

136
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,860
Because you are a ghost.

137
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,260
I'm always close.

138
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,980
I understand.

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,820
I understand.

140
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,620
You are a ghost.

141
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,900
Yes, yes, yes.

142
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,140
Scary.

143
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,700
I'm a scary ghost.

144
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,500
No, no, no.

145
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,700
If you feel cold, I...

146
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,860
It's me.

147
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,260
I heard that some movie.

148
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:22,840
Oh.

149
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,820
Some movie and under the bed and getting cold.

150
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,160
Yeah.

151
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,460
That is... Me!

152
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,460
That is...

153
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,980
Oh, that's what it is.

154
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,880
Okay, I understand.

155
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,480
That's what it is.

156
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,540
Okay, okay.

157
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,380
Oh, you guys every time so cold.

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,060
I think because me too always beside you.

159
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,760
That's what it is.

160
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,600
Heat tech.

161
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,120
Heat tech.

162
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,340
Wearing heat tech.

163
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,280
But in summer, it's so great.

164
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,740
Yeah, yeah.

165
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,640
Really?

166
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,380
Hot?

167
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,900
Already hot?

168
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,880
Yeah, if it's hot, I can make you cool.

169
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,940
Oh.

170
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,700
Oh, then really good.

171
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,220
Yeah.

172
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,420
See?

174
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,460
How about winter?

175
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,840
Oh.

176
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,840
It's okay.

177
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,220
Sometimes it's like eating ice cream in winter.

178
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,940
Oh, yeah.

179
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,980
Yeah, I understand.

180
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,440
Yeah.

181
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,180
Ice cream is always good.

182
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,540
Hold the time.

183
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,420
Hot time.

184
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,820
Every time is good.

185
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
That is you.

186
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,420
Okay, I understand.

187
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,940
Yeah, yeah.

188
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,540
Oh.

189
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,260
Oh.

190
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,460
This is our first.

191
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,440
Oh, yeah.

192
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,080
Our first collaboration.

193
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,160
Our first stream.

194
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:57,520
But my feeling is something weird because we, we, we, we two close.

195
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,720
Really?

196
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,540
I think it's normal, maybe.

197
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,560

00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,470
It's fake size.

687
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,910
It's a good bra.

688
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,350

Just wrong.

718
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,310
That's okay.

719
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,090

00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:12,590
Yes.

774
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,330
That's good.

775
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:16,550
That's good.

776
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,010
Yes.

777
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,410
Smoked meat.

778
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,430
Smoked meat.

779
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,290
That's BBQ.

780
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,310
Tacos.

781
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,670
Tacos.

782
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,990
Mexican food.

783
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:32,750
Tacos.

784
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:38,210
Mexican food in America is totally different from Japanese food in Japan.

785
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,470
Really?

786
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,590
How about Taco Bell?

787
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,770
Taco Bell is the same.

788
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,070
It's the same.

789
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,750
It's different from Taco Bell, right?

790
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,650
It's different.

791
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,950
What is different?

792
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,230
Smell or taste or size.

793
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,210
Taste.

794
00:35:59,410 --> 00:35:59,550
Taste?

795
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,970
More deep or something different taste?

796
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:11,290
Maybe real Mexican food is better.

797
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:11,510
Real?

798
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,330
Real.

799
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:17,390
Taco Bell is real.

800
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,070
Not real.

801
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,150
But America is not Mexico.

802
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,590
Just nearby.

803
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,450
Near?

804
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,510
How?

805
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:33,370
Guys, how people can eat real Mexican food?

806
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:34,170
Ah.

807
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,010
Mmm.

808
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,270
Maybe not Taco Bell.

809
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,030
If it's not Taco Bell, it's okay maybe.

810
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,270
Okay.

811
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,850
Taco Bell.

812
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,990
Taco Bell.

813
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,290
Taco Bell yummy.

814
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:49,470
Yummy.

815
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,330
Go to Mexico.

816
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,450
You can have it.

817
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,130
That is good idea.

818
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,190
Mexico.

819
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,110
Mexico.

820
00:36:59,410 --> 00:36:59,970
Mexico.

821
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:00,890
Mexico.

822
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,210
Mexico.

823
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:01,590
Mexico.

824
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,110
Okay, I understand.

825
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:10,070
Sometimes I'm watching American TV show.

826
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,670
I think that time.

827
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:15,770
I don't remember exactly.

828
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,950
I mean...

829
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,430
You know Dexter?

830
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,130
Dexter.

831
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,870
Dexter, you know?

832
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,850
The serial killer.

833
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,330
That guy.

834
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,550
That's why you think like...

835
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,510
Dexter.

836
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,670
Dexter co-workers.

837
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,590
I think.

838
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,770
I remember Mexican.

839
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,210
Mexican people.

840
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,250
Many.

841
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,010
And they using...

842
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,850
Mexico Spanish?

843
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,070
Oh yeah, Spanish.

844
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,390
And they saying...

845
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,090
Say to Dexter.

846
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,470
You studying...

847
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,350
Spanish.

848
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,830
So, it's about time.

849
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,630
You should study Spanish.

850
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,930
I talked to Dexter.

851
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,690
And then...

852
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:07,690
Somehow...

853
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,710
While I was eating Taco Bell.

854
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:10,890
While eating?

855
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,450
While eating...

856
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,170
I was like...

857
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:13,970
Is it like this?

858
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,230
I was thinking like...

859
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,110
Is it like this?

860
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,130
I was thinking like that.

861
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,190
It's a little bit different.

862
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:28,310
My image of Mexican people is...

863
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,750
In...

864
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,850
Inside Dexter.

865
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,330
Too different.

866
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,710
Different?

867
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,650
Why different?

868
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,430
Sorry.

869
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:36,770
Sorry.

870
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,410
Can you speak Spanish?

871
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,610
Thank you.

872
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,270
Thank you.

873
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,210
Yeah.

874
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,610
Thank you.

875
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,590
Thank you.

876
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,650
Thank you.

877
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,070
Teacher.

878
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,370
I love you.

879
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,430
I love you too.

880
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,690
Preciosa Minto.

881
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,490
I love you.

882
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,850
I love you.

883
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,410
I love you.

884
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,870
I'm studying a little and...

885
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,230
I'm studying a little and...

886
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,570
Now I remember Preciosa.

887
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,570
And...

888
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,550
Gracias.

889
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:16,930
And...

890
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,710
Nobio.

891
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:22,670
Because I talked to my boyfriend.

892
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,550
And Nobio.

893
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:30,070
I'm studying Dexter.

894
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,950
Mexican people is...

895
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,570
Different.

896
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,810
Maybe it's different.

897
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,290
I've never seen Dexter.

898
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,470
But I think maybe...

899
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,090
It's a little different.

900
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,910
Really?

901
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,410
Why no watching?

902
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,610
You ghost.

903
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,170
Everyone kill.

904
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,570
Everyone dead.

905
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,550
Inside the television.

906
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,450
Everyone dead.

907
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,070
Good.

908
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,510
Minto.

909
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,810
You saw.

910
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,530
You have been saw.

911
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,030
NCI.

912
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:06,590
NCIS.

913
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,950
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

914
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:08,870
Really?

915
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:09,970
Yeah, I've seen.

916
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,330
I've seen.

917
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,830
I mean...

918
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,930
I mean like...

919
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:15,830
Gips.

920
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,350
Oh, really?

921
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,750
Oh, yeah.

922
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,590
Because I'm 100 years old.

923
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,010
And Gips is too young.

924
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,150
Demi.

925
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,090
I like a young guy.

926
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,410
And I like Gips.

927
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,210
I think...

928
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,190
It's a little...

929
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,130
Is your head okay?

930
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,150
But sometimes...

931
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,950
Sometimes...

932
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,810
I mean...

933
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,730
Watching that...

934
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,210
Some teenagers...

935
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:52,670
Something...

936
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,430
Rumor...

937
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,110
Rumor...

938
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,790
Rumor...

939
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,110
Rumor...

940
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,310
Rumor...

941
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,270
Rumor.

942
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,290
Rumor.

943
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,130
Rumor.

944
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,470
Some high school story.

945
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,110
And some...

946
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,050
Why she dead.

947
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,790
Gossip girl?

948
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,490
No, no, no.

949
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:12,830
No.

950
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,690
Rumor.

951
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,250
Rumor.

952
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,530
Rumor.

953
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,490
High teen drama.

954
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,650
13 Reasons Why.

955
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,370
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

956
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:31,650
Sorry, sorry.

957
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,590
Sorry.

958
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,030
English.

959
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,890
Sorry, sorry.

960
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,670
Different title.

961
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:37,590
Sorry, sorry.

962
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:38,910
I've seen it too.

963
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,510
Yes, yes, yes.

964
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,470
You saw that?

965
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:42,910
Yes.

966
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,070
Too sad story.

967
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,170
Yeah, so sad.

968
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,290
Yeah, I mean...

969
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,570
Saw that.

970
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,570
I mean...

971
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,090
Feeling is some...

972
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,510
Complicated because...

973
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,330
I mean, cannot understand teenager.

974
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:00,810
Because I'm 100.

975
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,010
What are...

976
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,670
What they are... something, something.

977
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,450
I got really shocked.

978
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,330
Too young.

979
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,090
This is American TV show?

980
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,110
I think so.

981
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,410
Oh, I think so.

982
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:19,430
Do you watch a lot of American TV show?

983
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,050
Hmm...

984
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,670
Sometimes because...

985
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,470
My parents think about...

986
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:33,390
When I'm watching some English TV show.

987
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,010
They... my parents think about...

988
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:37,710
Oh!

989
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,770
I am studying.

990
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,530
They think about...

991
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:44,670
Oh!

992
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,390
I'm studying.

993
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,010
Oh, good girl, good girl.

994
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,530
Oh, yes, yes.

995
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,930
And I mean always...

996
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:51,150

997
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,710

999
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,270

1000
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,970
I mean always...

1001
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:01,810
Oh, yes, yes.

1002
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:02,950
I'm studying English.

1003
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,050
Studying English.

1004
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,150
Oh my god.

1005
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:07,930
Good student.

1006
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,630
No, no, no.

1007
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,010
I mean always...

1008
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,630
Studying something...

1009
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,250
Bad word.

1010
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,650
You don't know any bad words.

1011
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,770
You don't know any bad words.

1012
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,310
You're pure sensei.

1013
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,710
Yeah, yeah, I'm pure.

1014
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,250
I'm pure, really.

1015
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:30,090
I'm pure because...

1016
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,030
I...

1017
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,230
I never say...

1018
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,770
Someone, to someone.

1019
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,410
Like some F word.

1020
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,470
Because...

1021
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:46,210
I mean never been Google America.

1022
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,030
And I...

1023
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,210
I mean no chance.

1024
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,610
Saying to...

1025
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,890
Say F word.

1026
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,570
Oh!

1027
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,570
You can say it now.

1028
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,250
Not?

1029
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:58,830
Yeah.

1030
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,890
One more time, one more time.

1031
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,050
One more time, one more time.

1032
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,410
Can I say it properly?

1033
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,280
How about this?

1034
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,740
Is it correct?

1035
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,740
Yeah, it's powerful.

1036
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,940
Sorry, sorry.

1037
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,340
I like you.

1038
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,220
Just mean to hate you guys.

1039
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:22,700
No!

1040
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,060
I love you, yes.

1041
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,640
Before the stream, when you guys were crying...

1042
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,120
Don't cry.

1043
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,100
Yeah, we were talking about it.

1044
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,380
Yeah, but...

1045
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,020
I mean...

1046
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,740
Think about...

1047
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,620
Mean to tsundere.

1048
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,220
No, no, no.

1049
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,380
No, I mean just tsundere.

1050
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,500
Don't worry.

1051
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,500
Mean to always love you guys.

1052
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,560
I don't know.

1053
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,480
I don't know.

1054
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,120
I don't know.

1055
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,540
No.

1056
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,360
Yeah, yeah.

00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,140
Yeah, true, true, true.

1058
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,340
So...

00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,200
Tacos.

1060
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,940
No, snack.

1061
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:05,960
Snack?

1062
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:06,700
Snack?

1063
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,280
Like potato chip.

1064
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:12,960
Do you have something you like?

1065
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,820
Something you eat a lot?

1066
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
Yeah, like...

1067
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,240
Mint chan doesn't like...

1068
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:20,660
carbonated drinks.

1069
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1070
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,600
Yeah, so...

1071
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,140
Carbonation?

00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,320
Yeah, yeah.

1073
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,720
Orange, what do you eat?

1074
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,020
No soup.

1075
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,840
I want to eat something...

1076
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,740
Dirty things.

1077
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,260
Dirty.

1078
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,060
Dirty, salty.

1079
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,400
High calorie.

1080
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,420
Do you know...

1081
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,520
Kettle chips?

1082
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,680
Kettle chips?

1083
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,620
Yeah, yeah.

1085
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,000

1086
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,780
Kettle chips.

1087
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,620
Kettle chips.

1088
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,480
Kettle chips?

1089
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:03,480
What?

1090
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,160
Kettle chips?

1091
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,220
Kettle chip is kind of...

1092
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,080
potato chip?

1093
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,500

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1096
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,040
They're a little more crunchy.

1097
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,580
Oh, really?

1098
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,320
Yeah, yeah.

1099
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,280
I like crunchy.

1100
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,820
They're so yummy.

1101
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Cooked in a kettle.

1102
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,980
How taste is good?

1103
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,340
Something salt, bacon, something.

1104
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
Honey, something.

1105
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,420
Have you tried sea salt and vinegar?

1106
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,400
Yes.

1107
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,740
Yes, I tried that using lace.

1108
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1109
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,760
That is so yummy.

1110
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,040
Almost similar taste.

1111
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,160
And crunchy.

1112
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,260
This taste is same.

1113
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,240
But crunchy is...

1114
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,660
You should go to...

1115
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,720
You should see if they will take you to...

1116
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,780
Target.

1117
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,400
Ah, Target.

1118
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,600
I think about...

1119
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,500
going to send a box to me.

1120
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,180
Okay, I'll send a box.

1121
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,900
I'll send you.

1122
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,960
Okay, okay.

1123
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,180
So sweet, yes, yes.

1124
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,400
You...

1125
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,340
You...

1126
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,340
I think because...

1127
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:16,800
Ah...

1128
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,180
How should I say?

1129
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,840
I will send you to a hotel.

1130
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:23,840
I will send you to a hotel.

1131
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,880
Thank you, Mint-chan.

1132
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,440
I imagined this.

1133
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,320
If you go to Target...

1134
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,940
Go to Target!

1135
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:32,640

1136
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,520
I know Target.

1137
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,040
Yes, I have money.

1138
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,440
Yes, I have credit card.

1139
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,860
Yes, I can buy.

1140
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,300
Yes, I can buy myself.

1141
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,660
No, I'll buy for you.

1142
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,280
No, no, it's okay.

1143
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:48,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1144
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,920
I can.

1145
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,300
I can.

1146
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,200
I just need some money...

1147
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,000
exchange.

1148
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,760
This is too high.

1149
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,380
Dollar is too high.

1150
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,580
And it's very cheap.

1151
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1152
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,120
My dream is...

1153
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,880
I mean exchange...

1154
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,800
One dollar...

1155
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,100
One dollar?

1156
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,380
100 yen?

1157
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,340
It's about 150 yen now.

1158
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,440
150 yen?

1159
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,020
Yes, yes, yes.

1160
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,880
Because of Mint-chan...

1161
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,740
I mean steal money.

1162
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,320

Yes!

1414
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,860
I'm about to cry.

1415
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,800
I'm so happy.

1416
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,100
Really?

1417
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,500
And... and...

1418
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,780
I really want to asking...

1419
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,620
I heard I understand...

1420
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,360
I understand you draw your concept...

1421
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:45,760

1422
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,760
Oh, yes.

1423
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,780
Uh...

1424
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,100
I want to know which part...

1425
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,060
Is the...

1426
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,180
Point?

1427
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,960
Your design?

1428
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:55,760
Okay.

1429
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,300
Let's check.

1430
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,460
Let's take a look.

1431
00:56:58,940 --> 00:56:59,640
Yes.

1432
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,420
It's me!

1433
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,380

1434
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,300

00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,940

1438
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,500
Your butt?

1439
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:15,900
Your butt?

00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:21,940

1441
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,360
It's...

1442
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,800
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1443
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,340
Psycho.

1444
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,040
Psycho.

1445
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,560

00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:46,000

1452
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,560

1462
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,300

1465
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:12,800
Right.

1466
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,260
Chocolate.

1467
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,640
Melting chocolate.

1468
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,040
Oh...

1469
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,340
It's delicious.

1470
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,020

1471
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,660

La la la la la.

1473
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,480
Shut up.

1474
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,380
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1475
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,520
What's streaming?

1476
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,380
Okay, okay.

1477
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,760
It's okay.

1478
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,640
Please forgive me, YouTube.

1479
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,640
We are pure.

1480
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,540
Yeah.

1481
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,740
Don't worry, YouTube.

1482
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,580
Don't worry.

1483
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,560
This is just... this is nice about introduction.

1484
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,920
So just lick chocolate.

1485
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,360
Yeah, yeah.

1486
00:58:54,280 --> 00:59:00,040
You can see... you can see my ribbon is also chocolate.

1487
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1488
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,600
Really cute.

1489
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,680
How you think about this design?

1490
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,500
You want to be made first time?

1491
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,720
And I'm really curious you like mint choco?

1492
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,520
Oh, I do.

1493
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,660
But I don't know why I became mint choco.

1494
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,700
At first, I was only mint.

1495
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,200
And then I became mint choco.

1496
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,920
I don't know why.

1497
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:33,460
I

1498
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,540
love you.

1499
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,860
Mint choco.

1500
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,020
About 100.

1501
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,600
Are you 100 years old to eat mint choco?

1502
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,900
That is too...

1503
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:47,760
Too...

1504
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,180
What is it?

1505
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:48,940
Is it too stimulating?

1506
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,560
Like...

1507
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,280
Because...

1508
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,080
It's a taste I've never eaten before.

1509
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,220
It's like...

1510
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,260
After all...

1511
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:57,740
Is this okay?

1512
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,140
Is it okay to eat this taste?

1513
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,160
That's right.

1514
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,320
That's right.

1515
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,840
When I was born, there was no elevator.

1516
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,100
So...

1517
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,280
Maybe it's too much for someone who is 100 years old.

1518
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:11,680
Yeah.

1519
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,280
Mint choco is too difficult to taste.

1520
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:16,640
But...

1521
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,280
Not...

1522
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,840
Not dislike.

1523
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:19,620
Just...

1524
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,180
A little...

1525
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,620
Not good?

1526
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,280
Not good?

1527
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,360
Not good?

1528
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,540
Not good?

1529
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:28,560
Not good?

1530
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,800
Not good at?

1531
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:30,640
Not good?

1532
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,080
Yeah, not good at?

1533
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:32,500
Not...

1534
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,500
Not good at?

1535
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,240
Not good...

1536
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:34,700
But...

1537
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,180
Someone buying to me it.

1538
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:37,920
But...

1539
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,840
Not paying my money.

1540
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,260
But...

1541
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,260
But...

1542
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:42,680
But...

1543
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,120
I can paying to you.

1544
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,360
I love you.

1545
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,020
Like this...

1546
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:50,980
I'm really...

1547
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,540
I mean first time saw your design.

1548
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,320
I'm really shocked.

1549
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:55,820
Oh.

1550
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:56,300
Color.

1551
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,720
Because mint color is I think really good color.

1552
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,360
Because I mean never think about using mint color.

1553
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:04,900
Really?

1554
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,780
Using drawing.

1555
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,380
I mean wow.

1556
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,980
That is really funny and interesting.

1557
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,600
This is an interesting color, I think.

1558
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,640
This is a good mint.

1559
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,280
Good mint.

1560
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,420
Because I've never tried using that color.

1561
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,440
This time I'm using mint color.

1562
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,280
I'm really excited.

1563
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,040
A lot of mint.

1564
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,180
What?

1565
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,680
You're choosing mint color?

1566
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,120
Just you like mint?

1567
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,840
Yes, I like mint.

1568
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,620
My idol Oshi, her color was mint.

1569
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,360
So I became mint.

1570
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,880
Thank you, Oshi-san.

1571
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:50,880
Thank you so much.

1572
01:01:53,480 --> 01:02:00,620
Cute Mint appeared as your idol.

1573
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,600
Mint was born as your idol.

1574
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,500
Thank you so much.

1575
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:07,980
Thank you.

1576
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:23,860
So I want to know what's mint's favorite part.

1577
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,620
What part is your favorite?

1578
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,200
Or you like?

1579
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,460
Which part do you like the most?

1580
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,820
Your butt?

1581
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,780
My butt?

1582
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,400
Your butt again?

1583
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:35,520
Your chest?

1584
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,740
Your chest.

1585
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,260
That's your idea.

1586
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:39,680
I'm sorry.

1587
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,780
Your butt.

1588
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,940
Actually, I think my favorite part is my sleeves.

1589
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,280
Sleeves?

1590
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:50,840
Yes.

1591
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,180
Do you like?

1592
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:55,500
Yes.

1593
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,620
When you sleep in time, the sleeves...

1594
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,040
You can watch it or not.

1595
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,200
If you can't see it, you can do it like this.

1596
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,580
Like this, like this.

1597
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,780
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1598
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,200
That's it.

1599
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,380
Cute, cute.

1600
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,220
Thank you.

1601
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,840
So, it's my live drawing.

1602
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,400
On our live drawing.

1603
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,820
It's an hour-long live drawing, so...

1604
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,640
Good luck.

1605
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,200
Yes, yes, yes.

1606
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:32,120
I can't draw anything amazing.

1607
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,160
No, it will be.

1608
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,660
I just want to do my best.

1609
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:38,540
And...

1610
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,860
I think...

1611
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,820
I want...

1612
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,520
What?

1613
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,320
I think I'm drawing upper body.

1614
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,340
Because just one hour.

1615
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,180
Sadly.

1616
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:52,240
What?

1617
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,920
Pose or facial...

1618
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,000
Expose?

1619
01:03:58,340 --> 01:03:58,880
Expression.

1620
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,320
Facial expression.

1621
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,080
Expression.

1622
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,000
Expression.

1623
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,920
Expecto.

1624
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:08,400
Expression.

1625
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,820
Recently I went to Harry Potter cafe.

1626
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:13,780
Really?

1627
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,360
Before I go there, I will watch the movie again.

1628
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,380
And repeat Harry Potter.

1629
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,420
And what is good?

1630
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,220
Facial expression.

1631
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,620
I think...

1632
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:28,880
I...

1633
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:31,960
Honestly...

1634
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,160
Sometimes I think...

1635
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:39,940
Mint, why you using your face like that?

1636
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,040
Don't you hear me?

1637
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:42,800
Don't.

1638
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,120
I think you...

1639
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,880
You just...

1640
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,400
I think you just cute.

1641
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:53,760
But you using your face something ugly or something funny.

1642
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,640
And something became...

1643
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:58,360
Like...

1644
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:58,820
Something...

1645
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,280
Like...

1646
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:00,420
Something...

1647
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,700
Something...

1648
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,020
I think...

1649
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,820
There is...

1650
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,560
There is mint?

1651
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,000
What a face.

1652
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,800
What a face.

1653
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:13,860
But...

1654
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,240
Everything cute.

1655
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,000
But...

1656
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,460
I think...

1657
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,460
Emoji.

1658
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,040
Emoji?

1659
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:22,400
The emoji like...

1660
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,480
That face...

1661
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:24,820
And...

1662
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,240
Yes, yes...

1663
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:27,780
Okay.

1664
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,240
Because I think about cute girls.

1665
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,540
What to say?

1666
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,360
I think that...

1667
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,140
It's cute all the time.

1668
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:42,380
I think like that.

1669
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,900
But...

1670
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:50,400
Mint-chan uses her face in a funny way, so look at that.

1671
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,440
She says, you are a comedian.

1672
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,200
She says, you are a comedian.

1673
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:08,960
The pressure is too much.

1674
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,320
Why?

1675
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:11,540
You are normally cute.

1676
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:12,960
You are usually cute.

1677
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,180
This is strange.

1678
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,980
She is showing herself.

1679
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,120
She is looking at herself.

1680
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,700
She is looking at herself.

1681
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:25,020
She is looking at the mirror.

1682
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,280
She is looking at the monitor.

1683
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,620
She is cute.

1684
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,440
Even if she is normal, she is cute.

1685
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,560
Normally means...

1686
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,960
Everything means cute.

1687
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,340
Cute and funny.

1688
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,420
I like your humor.

1689
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,760
But sometimes...

1690
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,280
But it's funny.

1691
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:52,860
It's okay.

1692
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1693
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,780
I always think about...

1694
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:02,140
Mint is really good at using your character and your resource.

1695
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,980
There is really...

1696
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,780
I think you have talent.

1697
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:07,720
Ah!

1698
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,020
Yeah.

1699
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,440
I love you.

1700
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,480
I love you forever.

1701
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:13,440
Yes.

1702
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,840
And what pressure...

1703
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,820
Oh.

1704
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,460
Expression.

1705
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:20,360
Expression.

1706
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:21,840
Expression.

1707
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:22,520
Expression.

1708
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:22,620
Expression.

1709
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,960
Something cute.

1710
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,280
Or wink.

1711
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,740
Or something...

1712
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:27,440
A little snickering.

1713
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,200
A little...

1714
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:28,760
Hmm.

1715
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,040
Something...

1716
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,000
What...

1717
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,220
What is your...

1718
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,120
Normal?

1719
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:34,480
Normal?

1720
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,020
Normal?

1721
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,320
Maybe...

1722
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,020
Maybe...

1723
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:38,800
Maybe...

1724
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,260
Maybe the chat can decide.

1725
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,520
Because they will be the ones watching the picture.

1726
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,940
Watching you draw.

1727
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,440
So...

1728
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:53,260
Chat, what kind of face would you like to see Ayami sensei draw with me?

1729
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,200
What?

1730
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,780
Are you going to leave it to me?

1731
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,600
You are a pain in the ass.

1732
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,080
You are a pain in the ass.

1733
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:01,360
You are a pain in the ass.

1734
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:02,980
That face...

1735
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:03,820
That's a little...

1736
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:04,680
Don't say it's a bad face.

1737
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,280
Don't say it's a bad face.

1738
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:05,760
Ah.

1739
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:07,240
Oh...

1740
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,880
Can I draw a face?

1741
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,340
Can I?

1742
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,700
Can I?

1743
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:13,920
Can I?

1744
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,000
Can I?

1745
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,160
Can I draw a face?

1746
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:14,420
Do you want to draw it?

1747
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,900
I want to draw it.

1748
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:16,640
It's okay.

1749
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,280
It's okay.

1750
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:21,880
I will ask the staff or the people of Anime Central to ask Ayami again.

1751
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,960
What are you doing, Ayami?

1752
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:24,740
I'm sorry.

1753
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,160
I'm sorry.

1754
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:30,500
It's Japanese culture, Japanese culture.

1755
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:30,820
That's right.

1756
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,300
That's right.

1757
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,940
Japanese culture is not...

1758
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:34,440
Japanese culture...

1759
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:34,640
Japanese culture...

1760
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,020
Oh, not reading the third term.

1761
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:37,400
Understand!

1762
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,280
He calls it freedom!

1763
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,000
Oh, you say freedom!

1764
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:43,520
Freedom!

1765
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,660
Yes, I believe it works good.

1766
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,740
I saw maybe... smog?

1767
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,060
Smog is...

1768
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:53,860
Try it.

1769
01:08:54,200 --> 01:09:00,040
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1770
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,900
Your mouth is like a cat.

1771
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,460
I think you are very cute when you do that.

1772
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,260
Ah, I don't like it.

1773
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:07,520
I don't like it.

1774
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,240
Ah, how is it?

1775
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:10,680
How is your face?

1776
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:11,900
Ah, how is your face?

1777
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,740
How is it?

1778
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:14,800
Ah, that's right.

1779
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:15,780
It's always like that.

1780
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:18,200
I look at everyone from below.

1781
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,820
Ah, no, I look from above.

1782
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,220
I hate you guys.

1783
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,540
I hate you, but you came here today.

1784
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,020
I hate you, but you came here today.

1785
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:27,520
Ah.

1786
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:31,310
Maybe that's also good.

1787
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,270
Do you like me?

1788
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:35,530
Do you like me?

1789
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:36,810
Do you like me?

1790
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:38,030
Do you like me?

1791
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:38,330
Do you like me?

1792
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:38,550
Do you like me?

1793
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,270
Smog is also good.

1794
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:39,850
Smog, yes.

1795
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:42,370
Smog and smog are two...

1796
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:43,430
Wink is also good.

1797
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,430
Yes, Wink is good.

1798
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:47,170
But...

1799
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,350
Ah, I was saying earlier...

1800
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:55,970
I'm talking about mint using her face.

1801
01:09:58,530 --> 01:09:59,890
Something... something...

1802
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:01,070
Something different.

1803
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,390
You can say it.

1804
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:04,030
Say it properly.

1805
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:04,870
Say it properly.

1806
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:05,690
Say it properly.

1807
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:06,230
It's a smog.

1808
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:06,970
It's a smog.

1809
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:13,310
She's using her face every time, everywhere.

1810
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,210
Because I'm thinking about something...

1811
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:19,010
I was thinking about something...

1812
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,010
Maid.

1813
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,110
Mint maid.

1814
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:22,630
Yes.

1815
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:23,850
You maid.

1816
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:24,510
Yes.

1817
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:25,310
Maid.

1818
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:26,770
And something...

1819
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:29,950
Smog face is...

1820
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:31,270
You maid.

1821
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:33,350
When you using smog face?

1822
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:34,450
Ojousama.

1823
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:35,150
Ojousama.

1824
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:36,710
Gojousama.

1825
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:38,710
When do you use smog face?

1826
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:39,930
When do you use smog face?

1827
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:40,990
At the meeting?

1828
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,270
At the meeting?

1829
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:42,530
At the meeting?

1830
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:44,490
Thank you.

1831
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:46,250
I'll come again.

1832
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:48,070
That's it.

1833
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,990
Something different.

1834
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:50,590
Yes.

1835
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:50,810
Yes.

1836
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:53,010
When you take a break.

1837
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,570
Ah, that's right.

1838
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:56,810
When you take a break.

1839
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:57,230
When you take a break.

1840
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,150
When you take a break, you go back and say, I'm tired.

1841
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,090
I'm tired.

1842
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,550
I'm tired.

1843
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:02,650
That's right.

1844
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:03,230
That's right.

1845
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:05,670
It's cute no matter what you draw.

1846
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:15,650
But, as I asked you, Why I've been asking to you what facial is good?

1847
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:20,090
Because just cute or just smiling is...

1848
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:21,790
I think you don't like that.

1849
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:24,210
So, you...

1850
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:27,110
I think you like something funny things or something.

1851
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:28,430
Funny things.

1852
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:29,650
Maybe.

1853
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:32,690
I want to know what is good.

1854
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:35,170
Oh, maybe, maybe.

1855
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:37,630
As I thought.

1856
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:38,710
As I thought.

1857
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:39,810
Smiling face.

1858
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:40,610
Oh, yes.

1859
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,630
Smiling face.

1860
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:43,850
Smiling face.

1861
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:45,490
Smiling face.

1862
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:45,810
Smiling face.

1863
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:46,210
Smiling face.

1864
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:46,370
Oh, yes.

1865
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:47,650
Let's make a smiling face.

1866
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:49,830
Okay.

1867
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:50,850
Good luck.

1868
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,270
Ah, don't get arrested.

1869
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:55,470
Okay.

1870
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:55,730
Try.

1871
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:56,970
Just face.

1872
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:57,970
Just face.

1873
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:59,850
Not all.

1874
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,190
Okay.

1875
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:03,150
Is okay.

1876
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:03,770
I think.

1877
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:04,430
Like this.

1878
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:06,650
Freedom.

1879
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:07,570
Freedom.

1880
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:08,530
No...

1881
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:09,330
freedom.

1882
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:10,970
Just freedom.

1883
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,130
Yes.

1884
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,830
There is freedom to express myself.

1885
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,890
Freedom to express.

1886
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:18,090
Freedom to express.

1887
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:19,390
What do you mean by freedom?

1888
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,410
There are some expressions.

1889
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:35,570
For example, when I write on Twitter that I am an idiot, that is a free expression.

1890
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,090
Like, please forgive me.

1891
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,610
You can't be that free.

1892
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:42,450
I am sorry.

1893
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:44,250
Not freedom.

1894
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:45,170
I am so sorry.

1895
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:46,030
Sorry, everybody.

1896
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,850
That's right.

1897
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:47,550
That's not freedom.

1898
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:52,790
It's not that you are too free.

1899
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:58,110
Freedom and such...

1900
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:01,790
American culture is different from that of Japan and Asia.

1901
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:06,050
So I haven't really thought about that.

1902
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,450
Because, I mean...

1903
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:10,830
This time, first...

1904
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,290
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1905
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:12,990
We are America.

1906
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:14,570
America, yeah!

1907
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:15,790
Oh, yeah.

1908
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:17,830
I think...

1909
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:20,710
I mean, naked and walk.

1910
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,210
Park.

1911
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:24,350
Why naked?

1912
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:25,770
Freedom.

1913
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,050
That's not it?

1914
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:28,310
You are too free.

1915
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,710
But, is there such a thing?

1916
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:34,270
If you are naked, can you be caught?

1917
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,970
Yes.

1918
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:37,730
Then...

1919
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:39,050
Why are you surprised?

1920
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,530
That's not enough.

1921
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:41,830
Really?

1922
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:43,130
Why?

1923
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:43,370
Why?

1924
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:45,630
Eh?

1925
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:46,130

01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:19,650
Of course, no one showing real Ayami.

2059
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:24,810
But this time, real Ayami sitting table and drawing.

2062
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:28,690
Rare chance.

2063
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,210

Don't worry.

2078
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:41,310

2079
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,510
I'm wearing panty.

2080
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:43,970
Don't worry.

2081
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:45,030

Yeah.

2087
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:55,430
I can hide using my opai, long opai.

2088
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,410
I don't need panty, maybe.

2089
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:00,230
Oh.

2090
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:01,310

01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:01,450
Okay.

Ah, ah, ah, ah.

Maybe no one, maybe no one will come.

2097
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:08,930
Maybe no one will come.

2098
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:09,890
Wow.

2099
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,410
That's what I'm waiting for.

2105
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:16,690
Don't worry.

And also please wear something too.

2108
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:27,450
I'm really scary because I'm really nervous.

2109
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:29,810
And maybe?

2110
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:30,350

01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:59,010
Please give me a dollar!

2277
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:05,110
The plane is a little...

2278
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:06,670
The plane is a little expensive.

2279
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:08,150
Really.

2280
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:12,090

2282
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:14,470
Please!

2283
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:15,290
Someone.

2284
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:16,130
Thank you.

2285
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:19,810
Ayami is also looking for a husband.

2286
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:22,130
Boyfriends, line up.

2287
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:23,650
Yeah, please.

2288
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,790
Please showing your house.

2289
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,790
Oh, yes!

2290
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:34,670
If you get to autograph, you can show your house and how much you make.

2291
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:38,930
That's right.

2292
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:49,230
I think watching this stream, Mint fans and Ayami fans think about, wow, absolutely Ayami crazy.

2293
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:53,070
That's the best!

2294
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:54,770
They went crazy.

2295
01:24:56,210 --> 01:25:02,250
Well, this time, because I'm really some high.

2296
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:06,490
I'm a little excited and I'm having a lot of fun.

2297
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:10,290
I think it's okay to do it freely.

2298
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,830
Because until now, I was a girlfriend.

2299
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:21,750
Every time, I'm just the only girlfriend to my fans.

2300
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:27,450
I think Ayami will go to USA and I my feeling is something free.

2301
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,850
She's getting too excited, you guys.

2302
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:34,650
Yeah, and get married or divorce or go to jail.

2303
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,170
Everything is okay.

2304
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:37,610
Yeah, experience.

2305
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:38,670

01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:28,170
My boyfriend is boyfriend.

2496
01:33:29,630 --> 01:33:31,110
You girlfriend.

2497
01:33:31,730 --> 01:33:33,710
You girlfriend.

2498
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:34,110
What's different?

2499
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:34,610
What's different?

2500
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:37,130
Girlfriend.

2501
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:40,750
Girlfriend take shower together.

2502
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:41,510
Girlfriend take shower together.

2503
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:43,430
Boyfriend no touch.

2504
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:47,730
I'm platonic.

2505
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:49,110
I'm platonic.

2506
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:49,330
I'm platonic.

2507
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:51,070
Platonic.

2508
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:53,130
Don't touch.

2509
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:54,030
No touch.

2510
01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:55,190
Social distance, please.

2511
01:33:55,190 --> 01:33:56,150
Social distance, everybody.

2512
01:33:56,490 --> 01:33:56,750
Yeah.

2513
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:57,330
Yeah.

2514
01:33:57,330 --> 01:33:57,450
Yeah.

2515
01:33:57,450 --> 01:33:57,750
Please.

2516
01:33:58,570 --> 01:33:58,870
Sorry.

2517
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:01,790
Your boyfriend is lonely.

2518
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:03,350
Your boyfriend is lonely.

2519
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:04,510
I can't help it.

2520
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:07,210
Even though it's your boyfriend.

2521
01:34:10,350 --> 01:34:10,970
But...

2522
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:14,570
The really important thing is...

2523
01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:16,270
Not body.

2524
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:17,070
Body.

2525
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,410
Not body, I think.

2526
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:19,190
Mental.

2527
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:19,670
Mental.

2528
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:20,590
Emotion.

2529
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:21,690
Emotion.

2530
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:23,170
Love each other.

2531
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:26,690
Truly is really important.

2532
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:27,430
True.

2533
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:27,790
Body.

2534
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:29,330
Touch.

2535
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:31,870
And something, something.

2536
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:34,770
That is just...

2537
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:35,650
No, no, no.

2538
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:37,070
Too simple.

2539
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:39,150
Sorry, everybody.

2540
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:40,970
Sorry, sorry.

2541
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:42,690
I'm waiting.

2542
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:45,530
I'm waiting.

2543
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:48,770
True, true, true, true love.

2544
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:51,150
Oh, true love.

2545
01:34:51,410 --> 01:34:53,330

2546
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:54,510

2591
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,280
Ah, so sorry.

2592
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:49,260
What flavor is it?

2593
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:51,220
Mint flavor.

2594
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,440
Mint taste.

2595
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:54,960
It's like a toothpaste.

2596
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,280
Yes, some...

2597
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:00,220

01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:02,800
No, no, it's okay.

01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:21,720
Yes, yes.

2608
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:25,020
That time, I'm using some mint...

2609
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:26,080

2610
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,200
That is... not bad.

2611
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,120

Make a shower.

2615
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,780
Go away.

2616
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:40,660
Take shower.

2617
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:41,640

2620
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:45,020
Tooth.

2621
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,080

01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,000
Brush your teeth.

2623
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,900

We're busy.

2645
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:24,340
Go away.

2646
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,620
I'm really busy.

I'm packing and go to the airport.

2648
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,760
