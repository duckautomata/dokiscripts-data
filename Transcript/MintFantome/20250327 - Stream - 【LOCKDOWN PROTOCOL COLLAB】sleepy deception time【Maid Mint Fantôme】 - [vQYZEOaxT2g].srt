Nice to meet you!

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,350
Wow!

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,510
Nice to meet you!

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,390
Nice to meet you!

Nice to meet you!

Nice to meet you!

9
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,110
All of the people here are barringals.

10
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,710
Please use honorifics.

11
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,690
Yes!

12
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,210
I'm speaking Japanese!

13
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,370
I'm speaking Japanese!

14
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,710
I'm speaking Japanese!

15
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,150
I'm speaking Japanese!

16
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,410
I'm a genius!

17
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,870
I'm a genius!

18
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,830
Cassette tape?

19
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,790
How do I get myself ready?

20
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,410
You can put it in here.

21
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,150
I don't know.

22
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,630
I was like, you're not ready.

23
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,870
And I was like, uh...

24
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,470
Me too!

25
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,290
How do you get ready?

26
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,110
Eyelashes are on fleek, man.

27
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,370
I don't know.

28
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,070
How do you get ready?

29
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,810
How do you do that?

30
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,750
How do you do that?

31
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,490
This was in tutorial, man.

32
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,570
This was in tutorial.

33
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,970
This was five minutes ago.

34
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,730
How do you surrender?

35
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,050
How do you surrender?

36
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,810
Oh, I surrender too!

37
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,590
We all surrender.

38
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,570
You are the commander of the barrage.

39
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,670
Thank you, sir.

40
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,590
Thank you for coming today.

41
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,410
Thank you.

42
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,030
Thank you for coming.

43
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,870
Thank you for coming.

44
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,610
Thank you for coming.

45
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,770
Thank you for coming.

46
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,790
Thank you for coming.

47
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,490
So, today, we are going to have a bilingual Japanese, English, and Chinese conversation.

48
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,070
That's cool, man.

49
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,170
Someone died.

50
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,930
So, you guys are welcome to speak English, Japanese, whatever language is comfortable for you guys.

51
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,650
Stop dying!

52
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,030
Can we have introductions so that we know which color is which?

53
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,790
Which color is who?

54
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,290
Yeah.

55
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,370
Wait, how do you guys point?

56
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,890
We can hear you!

57
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,850
I don't want people to stare.

58
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,650
You can change the mic with the mouse.

59
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,170
Oh, really?

60
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,430
That's amazing.

61
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,910
You can toggle the mic.

62
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,110
Where is Henya?

63
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,650
I can't hear her voice.

64
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,470
She's gone.

65
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,610
I can hear her.

66
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,890
I can see her talking on Discord.

67
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,690
Huh?

68
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,710
Is she talking?

69
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,930
Henya, you don't have a voice in the game, right?

70
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,850
Henya, I'm not lying.

71
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,650
I was in the game, so I couldn't hear you.

72
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,550
I can't hear you.

73
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,710
I can't hear you.

74
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,710
I can't hear you, Henya.

75
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,610
I can hear you.

76
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,550
No, no, no, no, Henya.

77
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,850
I hear you, Geary.

78
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,750
Everyone's getting ready.

79
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,270
It's the first time for everyone, so it's fun, right?

80
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,470
Let's start with...

81
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,690
The light blue one?

82
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,730
Hi.

83
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,970
Nice to meet you.

84
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,350
Good morning.

85
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,150
I am...

86
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,450
Did you hide that much?

87
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,390
That's how you talk, right?

88
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,090
I am Mint Phantom.

89
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,550
Nice to meet you.

90
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,590
Why are you laughing?

91
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,430
Why are you laughing?

92
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,950
Nice to meet you!

93
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,490
Mint!

94
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,290
Yeah, I'm Mint.

95
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,710
Nice to meet you guys.

96
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,490
Nice to meet you.

97
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,430
Nice to meet you.

98
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,710
Nice to meet you.

99
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,670
Nice to meet you.

100
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,390
John Dongri.

101
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,270
You're lying!

102
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:52,970
John Dongri?

103
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,750
Who?

104
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,790
Who is John Dongri?

105
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,290
Who is John Dongri?

106
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,370
Who is it?

107
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,150
Henya, I still can't hear you.

108
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,830
I don't think... I think she left.

109
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,550
Are you okay?

110
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,410
Who is it?

111
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:09,990
Who is it?

112
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,130
Who is it?

113
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,270
Who is it?

114
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,270
Who is it?

115
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,450
It's true!

116
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,590
Who is it?

117
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,010
Who are you?

118
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,770
Who is it?

119
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,150
Who is it?

120
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,510
Who is it?

121
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,230
Who is it?

122
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,270
Who is it?

123
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,270
Okay, let's go.

124
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,830
Who is it?

125
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,590
I don't know at all.

126
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,590
Isn't it someone you don't know?

127
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,690
Who is it?

128
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,390
Who is it?

129
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,350
I don't know.

130
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,530
Who is it?

131
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,950
Who is it?

132
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,650
We have an imposter.

133
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,050
A real imposter.

134
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,530
At least you find Hideya-senpai because I don't... I'm

135
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,410
not...

136
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,670
Oops.

137
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,230
Sorry.

138
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,190
I'll permit the actual imposter.

139
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,210
Bro, I was just looking around and I was like, Who the hell is doing this control now?

140
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,990
I think I forgot to set it as private.

141
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:01,970
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,250
I don't even know if there's private for this customer lobby.

143
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,870
Oh, wait.

144
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,570
Oh, wait.

145
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,610
I'll switch my color.

146
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,930
Can I be green?

147
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,670
You can do pink, I think.

148
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,130
No, Kacen's pink.

149
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,610
Pink is Kacen-senpai, okay?

150
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:20,830
Okay.

151
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:21,850
Yes.

152
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,050
Hello.

153
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:23,690
Oh, you're orange.

154
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,130
Welcome to No Limit.

155
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,670
To No Limit?

156
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,430
Wait.

157
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,370
Oh.

158
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,950
Take your time, baby.

159
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,270
How do you point?

160
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,970
With right click.

161
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,410
Do it.

162
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:15,750
Do it.

163
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,290
Yeah.

164
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,390
Yeah.

165
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:17,710
Yeah.

166
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:17,930
Yeah.

167
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,210
Yeah.

168
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,590
Yeah.

169
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,050
It's silent.

170
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,410
I think I changed.

171
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,530
Am I yellow now?

172
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,970
Yeah, you yellow.

173
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,550
Yeah.

174
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,890
Kacen-senpai.

175
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,390
Yeah, you yellow.

176
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,410
Can you be orange?

177
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,010
He's killing me.

178
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,170
Can you say something?

179
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,510
Okay, I can change color.

180
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,130
I can change color.

181
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,150
Thank you very much.

182
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,350
Oh,

183
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,870
Henya is strictly in the Discord.

184
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,610
Henya is not actually in the game itself.

185
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,610
Her voice.

186
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,270
Can you unmute on Discord and put everyone's volume on zero?

187
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:28,530
Yes.

188
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,410
I think I finally got it.

189
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,530
Henya-senpai, that's gonna happen.

190
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,630
No, no, no, no.

191
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,410
That's gonna happen.

192
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,430
I think I finally got it, but...

193
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,830
So, everyone, put your volume on zero so the poopy show moves.

194
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,470
Oh, okay.

195
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,710
I trust you with that.

196
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,230
So, I'll set everyone to zero.

197
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:48,550
Yeah.

198
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:50,550
Perfect.

199
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,390
Okay.

200
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,770
Damn it, Hestia.

201
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,110
Every time I change a color, you change it to the exact color.

202
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,230
I was yellow, and then you were yellow.

203
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,450
I was like, okay, you know what, girl?

204
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,830
I'm gonna change it to a different color.

205
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,610
I'm gonna change blue.

206
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,290
I look over.

207
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,210
Guess who's blue.

208
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,430
Guess who's blue.

209
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,330
Okay, I'm gonna change it again.

210
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,370
Wait, wait, wait.

211
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,770
Let me change it.

212
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,670
Let me change it.

213
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,070
No, no, no, let me change it.

214
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,110
Let me change it.

215
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,430
I'm gonna change it to dark blue.

216
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,490
I am now going to be dark blue.

217
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,790
Dark blue.

218
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,530
That's not gonna happen.

219
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,770
Wait, why?

220
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,950
I'm gonna be dark blue.

221
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,110
You're white.

222
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,670
I agree.

223
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,550
Wait, how are you guys the same?

224
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,330
What the hell is going on?

225
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,930
Why am I synchronized with you?

226
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,550
We're both white.

227
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,150
Why are we white?

228
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,730
Hestia, I swear, don't put me here, girl.

229
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,010
Don't put me here.

230
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,670
I swear, I did not threaten you guys.

231
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,170
And I was like, no.

232
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,230
Let me change it to dark blue.

233
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,450
And then you were like, no.

234
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,750
And change it to white.

235
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,090
We can figure this out.

236
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,690
We can figure this out.

237
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,710
Okay, wait.

238
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,050
Who's this?

239
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,550
Okay, I'm purple now.

240
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,790
No, I'm gonna be purple.

241
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,750
It's too...

242
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,250
Okay, okay, we are different.

243
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,770
Okay, okay, we are different now.

244
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:38,770
Okay, take what you got.

245
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,690
Okay, we are all unique colors.

246
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,370
Okay.

247
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,230
Oh my god, oh my god.

248
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:50,590
I'm dark.

249
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,090
I'm dark.

250
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,110
What the fuck?

251
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,790
Ah!

252
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,810
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

253
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,910
Ah, ah...

254
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,490
What is this?

255
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,730
What is this?

256
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,390
Fuck it, I'm gonna go with this one.

257
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,170
Wait,

258
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,790
is her mic plugged into the game?

259
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,990
I'm gonna...

260
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,830
Wait, I'm gonna...

261
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,590
I'm gonna make myself...

262
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,070
Oh my god.

263
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,750
We will have to underline.

264
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,650
Now I look like a LeBron James.

265
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,990
My pookie LeBron Pon.

266
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,590
I said it to the tax person.

267
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,150
Fuck!

268
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,310
I said it to the tax person.

269
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,210
I said it to the tax person.

270
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:46,690
Fuck!

271
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,190
What is she talking about?

272
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,910
She's talking about the tax payers.

273
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,630
What the fuck?

274
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,020
We only did two people.

275
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,260
My name is RPR...

276
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,240
Done.

277
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:37,700
Let's go next.

278
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,800
I'm red.

279
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,720
Let's do it again.

280
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,640
Let's go.

281
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,900
Me?

282
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,980
Hello, nice to meet you!

283
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,540
My name is Kison!

284
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,420
My name is Kison!

285
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,760
Nice to meet you!

286
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,700
Nice to meet you!

287
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:56,720
Yay!

288
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,660
Yay!

289
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,020
Nice to meet you!

290
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,700
Me?

291
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Me?

292
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,380
Oh!

293
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,140
Hello, it is I.

294
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,180
Yay!

295
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,200
It was her moment!

296
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,840
RPR, you shut up!

297
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,620
Yuri, one more time.

298
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,820
One more time?

299
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,020
Oh.

300
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,520
Hello, it is I, Yuri.

301
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,280
I cook stuff.

302
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,020
Hello.

303
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,300
Yay!

304
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:30,560
Yay!

305
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,140
It's me, RPR.

306
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,820
I eat stuff.

307
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,300
Yay!

308
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,140
Oh, me?

309
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,080
Hello, I'm Maxwell.

310
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,980
Nice to meet you.

311
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,500
Hello, I'm Axel.

312
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,760
Nice to meet you.

313
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,300
Nice to meet you!

314
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,560
Nice to meet you!

315
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,820
Okay, next!

316
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,120
Oh, it's Genius!

317
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,940
Nice to meet you!

318
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,700
Yay!

319
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,040
Hello,

320
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,830
my name is RTK.

321
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,150
Some people call me Charlie.

322
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,190
I make stuff.

323
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,070
Nice to meet you!

324
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,270
Nice to meet you!

325
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,640
Charlie!

326
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,600
Charlie!

327
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,680
How do I ready?

328
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,500
Let me set ready.

329
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,100
Mint!

330
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,500
Mint-san!

331
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,080
Nice to meet you.

332
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm Mint Phantom.

333
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,060
Nice to meet you.

334
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Yay!

335
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:54,920
Yay!

336
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,220
Oh!

337
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,850
What is this color?

338
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:03,530
White?

339
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,390
It's me.

340
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,170
Nice to meet you.

341
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,750
How do you ready?

342
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,650
How do you ready?

343
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,050
Cue.

344
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,430
Cue and ready.

345
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,310
Cue and then set ready.

346
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:18,950
Yay!

347
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,750
Yay!

348
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,670
He really died!

349
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,330
He really died!

350
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,590
I see

351
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,110
What is that?

352
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:07,170
I thought it was obvious.

353
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,950
I think I played it before.

354
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,230
Yeah, I think we will find out.

355
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,050
Yeah, maybe.

356
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,270
I think so.

357
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:17,050
Yeah.

358
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,590
Oh!

359
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,870
Yeah!

360
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,870
Yeah!

361
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:31,910
Guys, I've never played this game before and I also didn't do the tutorial.

362
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,630
I'm innocent!

363
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,630
Scanner?

364
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,390
Where is the scanner?

365
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,470
Enya, have you played this game before?

366
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:54,810
No.

367
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:55,890
Me too.

368
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,150
I haven't even played the tutorial.

369
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,290
Me too!

370
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,210
Me too!

371
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,970
Are you an imposter?

372
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,610
No, I'm an employee.

373
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,610
Me too!

374
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:11,990
Are you an imposter?

375
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,130
No, I'm an employee.

376
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,190
Are you sure?

377
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,430
Yeah, I'm real, real, real.

378
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,750
No, no!

379
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,790
Real, real, real, real, real!

380
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:21,910
No, no, no!

381
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,430
Press F.

382
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,330
Press F.

383
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:31,290
F?

384
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:32,530
No,

385
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,430
no, no!

386
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,930
It is the first time!

387
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:39,370
First time!

388
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:39,890
First time!

389
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,970
Put your hands up.

390
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,250
High touch.

391
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,050
High touch.

392
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:53,470
High touch.

393
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,220
What are you pointing at?

394
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,240
I didn't shower today, sorry.

395
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,480
Oh, there is a timer!

396
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,820
Oh my gosh, we have 7 minutes.

397
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,480
6 minutes.

398
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:17,920
Ok...

399
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,940
I don't know!

400
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,540
I have...

401
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,980
I have scanner delivery pressure.

402
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,660
What is that sound?

403
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:35,980
I don't know.

404
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,200
Scary!

405
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,160
Scary!

406
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Scary!

407
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,520
Scary!

408
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,180
Scary!

409
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,500
What

410
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,140
is it?

411
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,600
Why am I dying?

412
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,850
Oh no!

413
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,070
What happened to you?

414
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,130
Yeah, we are both orbs!

415
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,030
We are both orbs!

416
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,370
Me too.

417
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,190
They are gonna start blaming each other.

418
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,870
Oh my gosh!

419
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,110
I don't know!

420
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,850
What happened?

421
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,350
What happened?

422
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,150
Oh!

423
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,750
RPR!

424
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,850
Oh no!

425
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,710
No stamina?

426
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,130
Wait, you can die from running?

427
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,410
Stamina kills you if you use it too much.

428
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,930
We just...

429
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,290
What is it?

430
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,750
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

431
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,350
Imposter too?

432
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,950
Yeah, looks like it maybe.

433
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,770
Oh my gosh!

434
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,250
Go!

435
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:34,530
I think we lost.

436
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,970
What happened?

437
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,170
Was it RPR?

438
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,650
It was RPR.

439
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,950
He literally was like, what's up guys?

440
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,550
And then he just shanked me.

441
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,430
It was definitely him.

442
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,910
My favorite is Axel was telling me, come to the hallway, someone died here.

443
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,390
And I just stabbed him in the back.

444
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,010
Literally, I looked back and he had a fucking knife on me.

445
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,470
I was trying to teach you how to play this game.

446
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,870
And I thought you were a helpless young kid.

447
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,010
And then you stabbed me in the booty hole.

448
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,370
Henry and I died from running too much.

449
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,890
You can die from running too much apparently.

450
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,910
Yeah, that's how Henry and I died.

451
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,950
Yeah, it was a test.

452
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,010
It was a test run.

453
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,250
Even if the bad guys are dead, right?

454
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,530
It wouldn't notify us.

455
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,990
So we have to always like...

456
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,930
Oh, so you have to kill them.

457
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:54,990
You can't just like boot them.

458
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:55,430
Yes.

459
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,790
Yes.

460
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,090
What should we do with this?

461
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,910
Ready.

462
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,270
High touch!

463
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,750
Hi-five!

464
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,750
Hi-touch!

465
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,030
High touch!

466
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,310
Hi-touch!

467
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,450
Hi-touch!

468
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,910
Hi-touch!

469
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,750
Hi-touch!

470
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,010
Hi-touch!

471
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,230
Hi-touch!

472
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:31,750
Hi-touch!

473
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,750
Now it just looks like we're summiting.

474
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,350
Nah, you keep your hands to yourself.

475
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,370
Hey, I'll just give you a high five.

476
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,210
I don't want a high five either.

477
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,070
High five!

478
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:45,910
How did you get the map?

479
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,570
There's a map?

480
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:54,650
So basically, Giri is very good at explaining, so I'm going to leave it to Giri.

481
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,970
I like the what the GamGam that doesn't play games is the one that's explaining.

482
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,290
Okay, so for the map, when you're in the game, you press Q, you look at the map.

483
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,950
So generally, as soon as you open it, you'll see a list of things.

484
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,910
It can be like, Scan 1, Deliver 6, and Battery 3.

485
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,070
That was kind of what we had last time.

486
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:35,370
So if you hover over the individual quests or the individual tasks that you have to do, it'll highlight where the dots are for you to go to do that specific thing.

487
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,370
So generally, all of these tasks are color-coordinated.

488
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:43,690
So for scanning and stuff, if you're colorblind, then just follow the diagram.

489
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,310
If you're not colorblind, then just follow the colors because everything is color-coded.

490
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:56,690
Delivery, I would say, is the easiest quest to do because you go to the delivery section, which is the orange part of the map, and then you go grab boxes.

491
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:02,110
The boxes will have stickers that will match the different departments that you could deliver the boxes to.

492
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,990
For example, if you deliver a box to the green room, it'll have a leaf on it.

493
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,370
So take the box to the green room.

494
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,370
There's going to be flashing dots in the green room to tell you where to drop the boxes.

495
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,450
Drop the boxes.

496
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,030
That's going to be one out of six deliveries completed.

497
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,970
And then you just run back to court to do that stuff.

498
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,370
Did you make this game or...?

499
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,150
He called you a nerd!

500
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,210
He called you a nerd!

501
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,610
We got this.

502
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,630
Axel, how does this look?

503
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,150
Do it again.

504
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:12,510
Do it again.

505
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:21,730
No,

506
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,570
no, no, no!

507
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,710
Oh no!

508
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,030
No, I want to Jork it.

509
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,210
How are you so good at that?

510
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,790
Oh, you're doing it!

511
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,290
You're doing it!

512
00:29:59,390 --> 00:29:59,890
You're doing it!

513
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,710
Axel is too busy Jorking it to get ready.

514
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,050
Ready out!

515
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,620
Kitty,

516
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,260
I'm gonna stick with you.

517
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,160
I don't know what to do.

518
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,720
OK!

519
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,180
And Gidi, hypothetically, hypothetically...

520
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,480
If I were an imposter, how would I kill someone?

521
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:04,900
Hypothetically.

522
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,840
Here, let's say...

523
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,220
No!

524
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,840
No, no!

525
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,160
Wait, no, no!

526
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,440
I said hypothetically.

527
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,280
I said hypothetically.

528
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,120
I just tried to learn the game.

529
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,340
I just tried to learn the game.

530
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:36,880
OK, I'm gonna find a knife.

531
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,340
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

532
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,240
I just took some.

533
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

534
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,360
Top secret information.

535
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,160
Sorry.

536
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,520
OK, thank you.

537
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,580
Wait,

538
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,340
how do I reload?

539
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,740
How do I reload?

540
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,640
I don't have a knife.

541
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,880
I have a gun.

542
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,980
I think it's too easy being an imposter.

543
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,600
It's so true.

544
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,180
Yeah, I don't know.

545
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,700
Wait, is this ammo right here?

546
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,460
This little blue thing?

547
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:55,920
What is this?

548
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,980
I don't know what that is.

549
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,920
No, maybe not.

550
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,580
I think it's a plug.

551
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,440
I don't know actually.

552
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,920
I'm gonna go kill more people.

553
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,280
Oh, it's a fuse.

554
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,260
Gidi died to old age.

555
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,120
Sorry Gidi.

556
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,420
No ammo.

557
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,840
OK, I can use my hands.

558
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,780
I can use my hands.

559
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,400
I prefer it that way.

560
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,700
Sorry Gidson!

561
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,220
Sorry Gidson!

562
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:35,640
Sorry Gidson!

563
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,140
Oh sorry.

564
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,840
That's me!

565
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,260
That's me!

566
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,160
What's that?

567
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,460
No, don't shoot!

568
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,940
I tried to kill K-san.

569
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,620
But I failed.

570
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,580
Look what she threw.

571
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:45,200
Yeah, I was the bad guy.

572
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,780
I'm sorry.

573
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,760
You didn't die by my hands.

574
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,420
You died of old age Gidi.

575
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,120
Everything kills you in this game.

576
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,580
You can't run, you can't jump.

577
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,940
You were also a bad guy or you were just an accomplice?

578
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,340
No, I was just a bad guy.

579
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,180
Oh, so there are two bad guys.

580
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:24,860
Wait,

581
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,900
so then they win?

582
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,140
Yeah.

583
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,160
But it looks like it's very easy to be the bad guy since you can die from exhaustion.

584
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,040
I think it's quite easy for bad guys to win.

585
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,820
I think so too.

586
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,700
That's what I said earlier.

587
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,340
There's 2 minutes and 40 seconds and if they don't make it, we win anyway?

588
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,100
Even though we're dead?

589
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,300
Oh, okay.

590
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,720
Easy.

591
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,700
Yeah, it's like Among Us.

592
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,460
If you don't finish the task, the bad guys win anyway.

593
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,160
What are you eating?

594
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,540
I'm eating noodles.

595
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:57,920
Yummy.

596
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,800
I got some Chinese takeout.

597
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:02,960
Yummy.

598
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,760
I'm so sorry guys, if you can hear, there's like leaf blowers outside.

599
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm so sorry.

600
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,420
I'm so sorry guys.

601
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,400
Oh, this is the gun room.

602
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,900
I should have gone here.

603
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,280
That's where they got the guns.

604
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,120
Look at that one on the top there.

605
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,720
Yeah.

606
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,100
Oh my god.

607
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,360
I mean for you Mint, maybe you don't remember that.

608
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,920
Just stick with your batteries, okay?

609
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,640
Okay, okay.

610
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,100
I'll stick with my batteries.

611
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,280
I liked using it in my hands.

612
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,220
I like using it.

613
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,900
It felt more personal.

614
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,500
You like to feel the life of running, what is it called?

615
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,860
Flowing through your fingertips.

616
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,500
Yeah.

617
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,600
You like it when they slowly choke out and then just like the last breath between your hands.

618
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,680
I think you're speaking from experience right now.

619
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,920
No, no, no.

620
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,180
Me?

621
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:51,680
No.

622
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,060
I'm just, I just read doujin, you know.

623
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,380
That's what I do.

624
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,180
Oh, so true.

625
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,220
I like how the people that are left doing the task are the people who have no idea what's happening.

626
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,040
I don't know.

627
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,800
I thought K-Sun knew what she was doing because she felt so confident.

628
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,780
She did the, she did the computer.

629
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,900
I don't know if Hestia...

630
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,640
I don't know which scan Hestia is doing because scanner needs two people.

631
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,100
The one that K-Sun was doing, one person is fine.

632
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,880
Where's Tenya?

633
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,640
Is she dead too?

634
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,620
I don't know.

635
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,640
I'm gonna explore.

636
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,900
I've never looked...

637
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,480
Yeah.

638
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,200
Let's see.

639
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,600
There's pizza.

640
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,300
Let's go towards pizza.

641
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,260
Tenya?

642
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,080
Tenya?

643
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,220
Tenya?

644
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,560
I'm gonna do an actual task next time, you guys.

645
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,220
Oh, I think I heard her.

646
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,980
Why are they trying to kill people?

647
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,660
We're both dead.

648
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:14,560
I don't think they care.

649
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,620
They're just gonna die now.

650
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,740
Yeah, again I would.

651
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,700
I'm for sure, guys.

652
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,340
Never fuck RQR and never fuck Mint.

653
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,380
No, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

654
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,180
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

655
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,420
No, no, I'm good, I'm good.

656
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,840
I don't know what I look like, but you can trust me.

657
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,480
You can see here.

658
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,180
This is what you look like right here in this game viewer.

659
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,840
Wow, my eyes are so...

660
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,780
Is there a different map?

661
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,660
Has anyone actually won?

662
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,180
No, I'm an employee.

663
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,260
I'm professional, I'll do it.

664
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,080
We can win.

665
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,380
OK,

667
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,840
yeah, delivery is easier.

668
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,280
There is a tutorial.

669
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,660
There is a tutorial when you open the map.

670
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,940
I think scanning...

671
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,780
Alright, I'm watching tutorial.

672
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,600
I'll play that next time.

673
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,860
We're learning, we're learning.

674
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,340
I'm an employee!

675
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,720
I'm scared, you guys.

676
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,040
I'm an employee!

677
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,580
Employee!

678
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,900
I'm just gonna get a gun just in case though.

679
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,540
No!

680
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,780
You can't use them.

681
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,050
What's my tasks?

682
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:50,450
Delivery.

683
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:50,930
Power.

684
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,470
So where am I?

685
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,170
Oh I'm there.

686
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:54,970
Let's go here.

687
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,110
OK guys, I'm gonna actually play the game.

688
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,910
So what do I do?

689
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,210
This?

690
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,520
Can I take the knife?

691
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,140
Oh I can.

692
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,200
Can I like... Oh!

693
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,680
Wait, how do I...

694
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,420
OK, so I can take the knife, but then I have something empty.

695
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,620
My bag is empty.

696
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,120
How do I put something in my bag?

697
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,080
I gotta find a fuse.

698
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,340
OK.

699
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,060
Toggle.

700
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,920
Thank you.

701
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,200
This is why I stream.

702
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,700
So you guys can help me.

703
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,700
A fuse.

704
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,260
There were fuses in...over here.

705
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,050
Empty!

706
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,930
It's empty!

707
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:55,910
It's empty!

708
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,550
It's empty!

709
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,430
You can't do that!

710
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,070
Watch out!

711
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:09,350
Watch out!

712
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:11,130
Mito-san!

713
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,390
Mito-san!

714
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,110
Mito-san!

715
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,390
That was dangerous!

716
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,450
It can't be helped.

717
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,670
It's this one, right?

718
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,070
I finally decided.

719
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,010
I thought it was this one.

720
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,290
It's fine.

721
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,250
There is nothing here.

722
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:32,950
I confirmed it.

723
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,930
Yes, yes, yes.

724
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,150
OK.

725
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,650
I don't have it.

726
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:40,950
I don't have it.

727
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:41,550
OK, OK.

728
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,050
He's not holding it.

729
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:43,490
I don't have it.

730
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,950
OK, OK, OK.

731
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,130
I will do this.

732
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,850
How do I get in?

733
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,490
Oh, I got it!

734
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,250
OK, OK, OK.

735
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,210
And then this?

736
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,270
Wait, do I put this in there?

737
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,370
Oh...

738
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,170
Wait, how do I do this?

739
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,350
I feel like a monkey.

740
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,510
Wrong color?

741
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,940
But there is nothing in the bookie room.

742
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,260
I trusted.

743
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,500
I trusted him.

744
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,800
Oteki-san.

745
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,720
I just met him, but I trusted him.

746
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,480
I was doing the task.

747
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,460
He even told me how to do it.

748
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,440
Poor guy, he even murdered me.

749
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,120
Poor guy!

750
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,360
Poor...where is he?

751
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,840
What?

752
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,420
Hina-senpai?

753
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,680
Hina-senpai!

754
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,660
You are a monkey!

755
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,060
Where is he?

756
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,640
Where is the red dot on him?

757
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,880
Oteki-san!

758
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,040
Oteki-san!

759
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,400
Also, red dot means impostor guy.

760
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,160
Red dot.

761
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,380
They are doing their job.

762
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,320
Gidi is so diligent.

763
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,220
She does her job.

764
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,520
I think only impostors see red dots.

765
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,080
Yeah, I think so too.

766
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,460
Here, Hina in addition.

767
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,460
The way you unlock the guns car.

768
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,900
I'm watching and learning.

769
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,980
I don't get it.

770
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,660
That means you have to get the right number.

771
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,200
So...

772
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:44,540
Why is Mint-san dead?

773
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,380
Oteki-san.

774
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,180
Oteki-san was killed.

775
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,120
Oteki-san!

776
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,780
Why is Tetsuya-chan dead?

777
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,260
He was killed by Hina-senpai.

778
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,120
That's a lie!

779
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,080
He was alive!

780
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,500
Isn't that Kei-san?

781
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,100
He was killed by Kei-san-senpai.

782
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,260
Eh?

783
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,300
That's a lie!

784
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,520
That's a lie!

785
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,060
That's a lie!

786
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,620
Because he was shot...

787
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:44,200
Because he was shot, of course I would say it's a lie.

788
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,740
It's a revenge.

789
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,000
It's a revenge.

790
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,680
It's a revenge.

791
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,180
I'm scared.

792
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,020
I'm scared.

793
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,500
That delivery was good.

794
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,820
This is the delivery.

795
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,440
Delivery.

796
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,740
There's so much here.

797
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,240
I don't know.

798
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,060
There's computers.

799
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,940
I think there's too many.

800
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,800
There's a lot.

801
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,220
It's a lot.

802
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:22,960
It's a lot.

803
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,180
I feel like...this is like a...you know...

804
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:37,560
In your first day on a part-time job the boss will show you around what to do.

805
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,880
It feels like that.

806
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,020
Yes, it does.

807
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:44,860
Right?

808
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,360
Except we died.

809
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,060
It's your job.

810
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:49,880
True!

811
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,020
Can't believe we're dead.

812
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,220
We don't know anything.

813
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,220
We keep dying.

814
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,160
Me too.

815
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,540
Have you played Tutorial?

816
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,560
No.

817
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,860
My goodness, me too.

818
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,120
I believe that you are a kid.

819
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,260
I didn't play Tutorial, but I believe that you are a kid.

820
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,320
I can't believe you.

821
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,300
What?

822
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,900
No, it's OK.

823
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm an employee.

824
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,280
What did we do wrong?

825
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,880
I thought we were doing everything so good.

826
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,740
Just how I feel about that.

827
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,420
No way!

828
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:05,460
OK,

829
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,700
are you guys ready to kill more?

830
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,380
Alright.

831
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,660
I'm kind of winning my task.

832
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,000
Yay!

833
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,100
We win!

834
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,780
My name will be there.

835
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,080
What happened?

836
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,980
I'm an employee.

837
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,460
OK guys, we got this this time.

838
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,940
I'll do it this time.

839
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,280
Scanner?

840
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,160
Scanner.

841
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,020
Scanner.

842
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,240
This way.

843
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,720
This way.

844
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,880
We'll live.

845
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,360
We'll live.

846
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:58,820
We'll play.

847
00:49:59,340 --> 00:49:59,760
For real.

848
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,360
Scanner.

849
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,800
I hardly even know her.

850
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,280
Scanner.

851
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,120
Oh, OK.

852
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,660
Super good job.

853
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,940
No, I don't see anything.

854
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,660
Oh, I see.

855
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,500
You know how I'm looking right?

856
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,240
It goes right.

857
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,220
I'm looking left.

858
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:50,460
So you have to direct my head in a way to get to the circle and we have to do all that.

859
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,860
OK, so that's for you and Tenya now.

860
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,300
OK?

861
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,600
OK, I'll stand.

862
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,720
OK.

863
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,220
A

864
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,660
little more right.

865
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,200
A little bit.

866
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,210
A little right.

867
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:23,430
Just a little right.

868
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,750
A little bit.

869
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:46,190
What?

870
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:46,930
I'm sorry!

871
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:48,130
I'm sorry!

872
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,540
It can't be helped.

873
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,420
It can't be helped.

874
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:54,940
It can't be helped.

875
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,180
It can't be helped.

876
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,920
What is this?

877
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,060
What did it do?

878
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:06,580
What?

879
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,070
Kahoot?

880
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,630
I don't know.

881
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,350
We got one die.

882
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,790
Wait, Tenya was impostor.

883
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:28,470
Well, for Tenya it's OK.

884
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:33,210
We can look around you guys.

885
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,930
I don't know why anything is happening.

886
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,990
I want to go to the pizza room.

887
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:38,890
Oh, it's this way.

888
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:39,710
Pizza.

889
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:40,310
Oh, here.

890
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:40,910
Pizza room.

891
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,310
Oh, Pizushi.

892
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:47,630
Pizushi.

893
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:50,870
Seaweed?

894
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,910
I wish I could do stuff as a ghost.

895
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,030
Need rice.

896
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,390
Shouganai, she said.

897
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:01,110
I don't think she was impostor.

898
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,950
She said it can't be helped.

899
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,070
I don't know.

900
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,210
I actually don't know.

901
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:10,510
We haven't been down here, have we?

902
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,930
Guys, I'm still waking up.

903
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,690
It's hard to think.

904
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:21,170
I'm so tired.

905
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:33,150
I have my glasses on because I'm too tired to put in my contacts.

906
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,530
Are you guys doing OK?

907
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:39,070
Are you guys having fun watching my first time?

908
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,910
I've seen people play this game before, but I never...

909
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:46,110
So I knew it was kind of like Among Us style, but I've never played it myself.

910
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,770
This is my first time.

911
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,250
It's 9pm for you?

912
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:51,070
Wow.

913
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,710
It will be that time for me later.

914
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,350
You're learning too?

915
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,990
I'm nervous because it's my first time playing with everybody.

916
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,910
Well, not for everybody, but you know what I mean.

917
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,870
I don't know so many people here.

918
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,170
I got murdered by K-san.

919
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:16,970
Maybe that is, in of itself, an achievement.

920
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,470
What's this doing here?

921
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,430
Where is everybody?

922
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,230
Oh, that's a wall.

923
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,450
Dreams come true.

924
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,790
Wow, it's so peaceful.

925
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,130
Where is everybody actually?

926
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:38,750
Hello?

927
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,590
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

928
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:46,490
I think I'll take...oh wait.

929
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,590
I think they said that...

930
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:54,590
The collab should be about 2 hours, so I'm gonna do...

931
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,190
Nintendo Direct watch along after this.

932
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,030
What happened?

933
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,290
What happened?

934
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,290
What the heck?

935
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,570
We got one die on the scan.

936
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,630
We did it!

937
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,150
And I trusted you!

938
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,550
Sorry!

939
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,410
OK!

940
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,430
High five!

941
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,130
Let's see...

942
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:08,910
Seriously?

943
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,950
Only you can do that.

944
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:16,630
Can we have like less tasks?

945
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,930
Yeah, less tasks.

946
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,990
Beginner recommended.

947
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:24,250
If you are not yet familiar with the game, reduce task complexity.

948
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,290
Less tasks.

949
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,630
Onegaishimasu.

950
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,910
There's only two!

951
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:45,070
Pressure.

952
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:47,810
Pressure, pressure.

953
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,990
I don't think delivery is a task.

954
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:55,430
No!

955
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,030
No, we only got one task though.

956
00:56:58,430 --> 00:56:59,330
One task?

957
00:56:59,490 --> 00:56:59,810
OK.

958
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,230
Yeah, we only got the pressure one.

959
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:02,890
Pressure.

960
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:04,530
What do you do for pressure?

961
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:08,030
What do I do here?

962
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,070
You need to bring the...what's it called?

963
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:12,890
The cans over here.

964
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:13,510
OK.

965
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,850
Oh, these ones.

966
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,400
Razzies.

967
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,660
I have red ones.

968
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,820
I think red means...

969
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,080
Pressure.

970
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:44,820
Is it getting good?

971
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,560
Nice!

972
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,260
We are collecting power now.

973
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:52,800
It's going well.

974
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,000
It's going well.

975
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,540
It looks like it's going well.

976
00:57:59,280 --> 00:57:59,740
It looks like it's going well.

977
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,000
Then...

978
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,440
This one?

979
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:06,880
This one?

980
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,080
This one?

981
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,700
It's getting red.

982
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,380
It's not getting red.

983
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,320
Then isn't this one correct?

984
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,260
It's important, but the pattern is a little...

985
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,400
It's a little different.

986
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,760
Oh, the pattern.

987
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,020
For now, let's leave it as it is.

988
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,100
For now.

989
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,360
The others are red and...

990
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:29,860
Then this one?

991
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,740
Yeah, let's leave it as it is.

992
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,020
What are you doing?

993
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:38,280
There's one more can somewhere.

994
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,100
This one and the white power battery.

995
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,140
White?

996
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,020
What?

997
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,920
Red, red.

998
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,660
Everyone...

999
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,960
How did we all die?

1000
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,100
Everyone died.

1001
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,180
Everyone died!

1002
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,920
This is difficult.

1003
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,360
The pressure.

1004
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:27,800
This is difficult.

1005
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,120
How did we all die?

1006
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,340
There was an explosion in the middle.

1007
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,280
I knew it.

1008
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:37,500
I knew it.

1009
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:38,920
I wanted to cry.

1010
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,480
Oh my God.

1011
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,920
Look at the crackle in the sky.

1012
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,120
The crackle...

1013
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:54,920
I think the pressure...

1014
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,280
We are all dead.

1015
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:11,240
Who is still alive?

1016
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,000
That's Axel.

1017
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,880
Where is Ahenya and K-san?

1018
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,210
I can't hear them.

1019
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,450
Are they dead too?

1020
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:46,710
This game is too difficult!

1021
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,110
Everyone died!

1022
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:14,310
This game is too hard!

1023
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:18,810
Axel!

1024
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:25,070
Who is the second one?

1025
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,830
Who is the second one?

1026
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:37,630
I was the employee too!

1027
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:48,770
Oh wait, sorry.

1028
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:50,270
That's the only one that was the employee.

1029
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,330
It's just the two of us!

1030
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:53,810
That's right!

1031
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:59,710
It's tough right now.

1032
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:04,990
This is...

1033
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:17,350
Scanner and...

1034
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:23,030
You are...no?

1035
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,530
You will cross eyes.

1036
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,410
Yeah, I'm the bad guy.

1037
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:31,890
But you guys are the bad guys.

1038
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:35,930
OK,

1039
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:40,130
employee.

1040
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:40,830
Employee.

1041
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:50,830
Just one task!

1042
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,350
We have one!

1043
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,690
One task!

1044
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:03,790
One task!

1045
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,970
Wait,

1046
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,150
do we have to do everyone?

1047
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,630
I'll go red.

1048
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:20,470
OK, we'll go red.

1049
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:23,330
Wait...

1050
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,110
This is the power, right?

1051
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,310
Oh it's on.

1052
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:36,470
Wait...

1053
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:39,050
We don't have any tasks here though.

1054
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,090
Axel, there was...

1055
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:42,390
The power!

1056
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:43,890
Over here!

1057
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:47,030
Over here, over here!

1058
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:55,830
Check

1059
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,100
the other section?

1060
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:07,660
OK, OK.

1061
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,280
Maybe we need a fuse like that?

1062
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,520
I think that one is OK maybe.

1063
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,480
OK...

1064
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,020
OK,

1065
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:27,320
I'll take the battery.

1066
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
My battery!

1067
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,740
What's that sound?

1068
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,220
Is this where the tape cassette was?

1069
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:34,800
Oh yeah, yeah.

1070
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:35,940
Oh!

1071
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,400
Burning wish.

1072
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:45,800
DMCA

1073
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,300
What did you say, Super Chat?

1074
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,700
Surely we get this one.

1075
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,920
I am reading Super Chats.

1076
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,620
I saw it earlier.

1077
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,840
Sorry, I'm so tired you guys.

1078
01:04:59,400 --> 01:04:59,960
What?

1079
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:02,680
What?

1080
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,980
Hey, Mr. Rabbit.

1081
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:05,780
Mr. Rabbit.

1082
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:06,020
Mr. Rabbit.

1083
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:23,420
Is everyone OK?

1084
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,420
I love it!

1085
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,160
Are you...

1086
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,360
Why is everyone dead here?

1087
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:53,660
Oh.

1088
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,720
Why are they dead there?

1089
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,700
I don't know, guys.

1090
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,440
So, this one doesn't work.

1091
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,580
I don't have anything.

1092
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,600
You have to put everything in there.

1093
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,780
You have C4?

1094
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,220
I want to see it.

1095
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:29,920
I want a C4.

1096
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,360
This is C4, but I need some like switch to activate it.

1097
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,260
Will this work?

1098
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:37,820
Yes.

1099
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,160
This is cool.

1100
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,720
I don't have the thing for it.

1101
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:09,080
You're not gonna take my weapon, right?

1102
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:09,860
And kill me?

1103
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,980
Nice to meet you.

1104
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,420
Nice to meet you.

1105
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:22,620
No,

1106
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,040
no, no.

1107
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,480
Banzai, banzai, banzai.

1108
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,560
Banzai, banzai.

1109
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,060
OK, banzai, banzai.

1110
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:42,520
Wait, wait.

1111
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:43,900
You put it away.

1112
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,180
Hestia!

1113
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,720
Hestia is trying to kill me!

1114
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,900
She was trying to kill me.

1115
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,300
I'm innocent.

1116
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,840
It was self defense.

1117
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:30,520
Self defense.

1118
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:51,620
2 minutes left.

1119
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:00,340
We only have 2 minutes guys.

1120
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,390
That's it.

1121
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,740
I'll take this.

1122
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,340
Oh empty?

1123
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,340
Who killed me?

1124
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:53,000
I think...

1125
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,900
Daniel!

1126
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:06,420
I believe in her!

1127
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:18,460
He is running so...

1128
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:21,320
He is running so desperately.

1129
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:30,560
That's not true!

1130
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,280
Wait,

1131
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:37,700
ah?

1132
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,500
I don't know who at all was...

1133
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,980
Thank you for coming!

1134
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,160
Thank you for coming!

1135
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:12,980
Thank you for coming!

1136
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:33,140
No, no, no.

1137
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,900
Thank you to Mochi for raiding me.

1138
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,960
Happy birthday Mochi!

1139
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:03,500
Happy birthday to you!

1140
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,480
That's not what you do on someone's birthday.

1141
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,820
Don't do that on someone's birthday.

1142
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:27,860
Don't do that.

1143
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:33,960
The second thing that you did.

1144
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,820
Yeah, that thing.

1145
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,520
How do you learn to jork it?

1146
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:51,980
Am I doing it right?

1147
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,100
What the fuck are you?

1148
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,640
She told her to try it out.

1149
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,700
Oh, wait, am I...

1150
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,040
Oh, I didn't try yet.

1151
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,240
It's not easy!

1152
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,260
Don't let Giddy fool you!

1153
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,540
It's not easy.

1154
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,200
It's not easy.

1155
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,160
It's so hard.

1156
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,260
It's so hard!

1157
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,980
Ok, Giddy, then don't leave us alone.

1158
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,540
I'll look, I'll look, I'll look.

1159
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,800
Look to your right.

1160
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:02,900
Ok, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, and stop!

1161
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,160
Move to the right a little, look to the left a little bit, but slowly.

1162
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,140
Left, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.

1163
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:10,420
Stop!

1164
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:11,920
Stop!

1165
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:12,900
Stop!

1166
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,080
Hey, I got the scanner too!

1167
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,080
You got the scanner too?

1168
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:22,080
Stop, stop, stop, and then look to your right again, a little bit, a little.

1169
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:25,220
Very slow, very slow, to the left, to the left.

1170
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,860
Slowly, slowly, you are very close.

1171
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,700
Slowly, slowly, you are doing great.

1172
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,000
Ok, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1173
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,300
It's too fast!

1174
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:38,380
It's too fast!

1175
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,700
Let's go!

1176
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,240
Ok,

1177
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,080
let's go!

1178
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,320
Let me do it again.

1179
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,520
Sorry, let me do it again.

1180
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:55,640
Oh!

1181
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,880
I didn't even ready up.

1182
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,220
There is two now, ok, ok.

1183
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:07,720
Let me get the power.

1184
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,180
Power.

1185
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:09,940
Power.

1186
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,200
Oh, the power!

1187
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,580
I'll go find it.

1188
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,640
Not here.

1189
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:18,240
No.

1190
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,000
The power, power.

1191
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:23,500
What's that?

1192
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,540
Oh, it's a C4, no?

1193
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,040
I'm looking for weapons.

1194
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:37,620
Wait, where would a good weapon be?

1195
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,220
Maybe this way.

1196
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,640
I'm feeling evil.

1197
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,140
I'm feeling evil.

1198
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:48,920
I need to bring a gun.

1199
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:54,540
I am!

1200
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:56,880
Ok.

1201
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:09,840
Nice.

1202
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:11,960
Ok.

1203
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:18,260
Pressure time.

1204
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:30,730
No!

1205
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,530
No!

1206
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:35,530
No!

1207
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:40,610
Wait,

1208
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,920
do you want fish?

1209
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:47,220
Yeah!

1210
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:49,920
Here.

1211
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,480
Mint!

1212
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:57,980
Mint is the one!

1213
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:58,480
Mint!

1214
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,980
No, you just killed...you just killed a lobster!

1215
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,640
He had a gun.

1216
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,600
Where did he drop the gun?

1217
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:16,900
Where did the gun go?

1218
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,380
Oh, I don't think it has any...

1219
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:43,140
How did she kill me so fast?

1220
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,540
How did she kill me so fast?

1221
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:53,180
Yeah,

1222
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,280
you told me only me.

1223
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,620
I knew it.

1224
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:08,820
K-san killed me.

1225
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:13,960
Yeah, she's imposter.

1226
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,460
No,

1227
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:26,240
it's K-san.

1228
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:37,180
Not yet at all.

1229
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:37,780
Wait!

1230
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:37,980
Wait!

1231
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:38,260
Wait!

1232
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:38,520
Wait!

1233
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:38,720
Wait!

1234
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:39,020
Wait!

1235
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:39,080
Wait!

1236
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:39,540
Wait!

1237
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,560
There's something wrong...

1238
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,720
I'm not feeling good.

1239
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:50,900
Wait, he made me do it.

1240
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:55,280
What the heck is that?

1241
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,380
Did he grab them at one random?

1242
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:00,920
Ehh... Ninja-san, no!

1243
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:01,720
Ninja-san!

1244
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:02,800
You're not an impostor!

1245
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,680
Ehh... you killed me...

1246
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,400
You're lying, you're lying.

1247
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,300
You're lying, you're lying.

1248
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:11,460
I'm sorry, I'm an imposter.

1249
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,180
I knew it, I knew it!

1250
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,200
Look...

1251
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:23,940
I saw you, you know, you were doing that thing where you open the window and get forgiven.

1252
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,180
It worked.

1253
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,480
It worked.

1254
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:29,860
It worked out.

1255
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:37,420
It's gary!

1256
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:42,580
It was kind of late for her to say that it was me.

1257
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,040
She's...

1258
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:04,440
Nice timing!

1259
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,480
Nice timing!

1260
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,340
Nice timing!

1261
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,300
You're innocent to be an imposter.

1262
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,280
No, I'm evil!

1263
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:37,700
You're evil!

1264
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,860
I can't be evil!

1265
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:45,400
I'm sorry!

1266
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,780
Let's make up.

1267
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,100
Let's make up.

1268
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:51,840
Let's make up!

1269
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:02,300
I hive!

1270
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,480
High touch!

1271
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:06,540
High touch!

1272
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:28,760
Everyone else...Everyone died by the pressure.

1273
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:35,800
You just sprinted towards me with a knife!

1274
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,900
I mean, what was I supposed to do?

1275
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,100
That's a bad guy.

1276
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:43,140
That's a bad guy.

1277
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,060
Hey guys, guys, back off!

1278
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:46,300
Hey!

1279
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,320
Stop!

1280
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:49,480
Stop!

1281
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:50,600
Get away!

1282
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:53,040
Did you stop when K-Fun acted?

1283
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:53,440
Stop!

1284
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:56,620
Did you stop when K-Fun said, please don't kill me?

1285
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,040
Did you just say that?

1286
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:58,700
No, you didn't.

1287
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,200
No, you didn't.

1288
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:12,400
I think I heard Henya from the distance.

1289
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,100
That poor guy though.

1290
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,080
Innocent!

1291
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:17,640
Innocent!

1292
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:18,180
Innocent!

1293
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:21,560
The pressure, again?

1294
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:22,560
Oh no.

1295
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:23,180
Oh delivery!

1296
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:25,780
I'll do delivery.

1297
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:25,900
Delivery.

1298
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:28,700
Delivery.

1299
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,280
Delivery.

1300
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:31,800
Delivery.

1301
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:32,840
Delivery.

1302
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,060
Delivery.

1303
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:35,940
This is self-defense.

1304
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:40,080
Delivery.

1305
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,120
Oh, here is a...

1306
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,920
This is a...for pressure.

1307
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,540
Pressure!

1308
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,120
No pressure!

1309
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:57,500
No pressure!

1310
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:07,860
Is there no delivery?

1311
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,570
Package?

1312
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:26,190
Hello!

1313
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:29,470
Oh, Ota?

1314
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:32,250
Oh, ok.

1315
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:35,150
Oh my...

1316
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:38,070
Ok, so just pressure.

1317
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:38,910
Just pressure.

1318
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:55,050
I don't trust.

1319
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:55,910
I don't trust.

1320
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:59,470
Oh, you can trust me.

1321
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:01,270
Ok, I trust you.

1322
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:05,890
Oh...

1323
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:09,710
I don't trust.

1324
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:11,610
I don't trust.

1325
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:17,910
Wait, how did...how did he die?

1326
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:19,230
He's so far...

1327
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:31,010
How did she die?

1328
01:24:32,010 --> 01:24:32,830
Trap?

1329
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:33,010
No?

1330
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:39,670
It's not me.

1331
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:41,470
It's self-defense.

1332
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:46,630
What's happening?

1333
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,800
Who's shooting?

1334
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,660
Sniper?

1335
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,740
Who's alive?

1336
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,760
Who's...

1337
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:08,920
Who's alive?

1338
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,260
Is

1339
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,640
there anybody else?

1340
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,140
Hello?

1341
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:34,900
Hello?

1342
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,040
Me?

1343
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,780
I don't know how to do this!

1344
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:07,420
What?

1345
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:27,130
Ok,

1346
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:35,840
now I can do the pressure.

1347
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:38,900
Wait, what's this?

1348
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:42,600
Nothing.

1349
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,080
Time for pressure!

1350
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,080
Time for pressure.

1351
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,640
I'm an employee!

1352
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,440
I'm the employee of the month.

1353
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,080
I'm the employee.

1354
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:54,960
I'm the employee.

1355
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:55,720
I'm the employee.

1356
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,700
Ok, Gidi from beyond the grave, can you tell me how to do this?

1357
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:06,960
Ok.

1358
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,120
Oh it's empty.

1359
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,460
Press the blue arrow.

1360
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:19,840
Gidi!

1361
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,100
Gidi, wake up!

1362
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,760
Gidi, wake up!

1363
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:24,180
Wake up!

1364
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:24,880
Wake up!

1365
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:25,100
Wake up!

1366
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:27,820
Gidi!

1367
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,160
Gidi!

1368
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:39,530
It's a number guesser?

1369
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:44,450
Like that?

1370
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:53,200
Wait,

1371
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:58,080
maybe over here?

1372
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,340
Oh this one is ok.

1373
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,900
This one is green.

1374
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,660
Need all four?

1375
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:22,080
We have 4 minutes guys!

1376
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:25,720
Green.

1377
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:29,820
It's ok!

1378
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:30,420
It's ok!

1379
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:30,960
It's ok!

1380
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,820
Second one needs a blue.

1381
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,240
What do you mean?

1382
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:40,660
What do you mean it needs a blue?

1383
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,540
This one is done, no?

1384
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:43,580
Chat!

1385
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:46,120
Gidi!

1386
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:47,540
Gidi!

1387
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:49,000
Stop being so lazy!

1388
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,640
Only the wrong ones explode out.

1389
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,720
What?

1390
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:55,120
Before!

1391
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,600
What did I do before?

1392
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,300
Wait, I don't remember.

1393
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:07,960
Wait!

1394
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,880
So this one is wrong!

1395
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,180
Wait, is there another one?

1396
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:14,260
Look for other canister.

1397
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:17,200
Other canister!

1398
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:17,700
Other canister!

1399
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,980
Ok, ok, ok.

1400
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:24,900
I'll look around.

1401
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,120
Take a blue!

1402
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,460
Wait...

1403
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:32,520
You think it's...

1404
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:39,920
It's way too early for me to be doing this!

1405
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:45,520
Take a blue.

1406
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:47,960
Turn off the other one.

1407
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,140
But it's working!

1408
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,240
Why would I turn it off?

1409
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:54,140
Orange storeroom.

1410
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,140
There's none here, chat!

1411
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,880
There's none here!

1412
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:04,180
What's this do?

1413
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,480
Turn off the other.

1414
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:13,120
Ok.

1415
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,060
What's this?

1416
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,140
What's it do?

1417
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:19,440
Off.

1418
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:25,720
Ok, I take the blue.

1419
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:26,420
Why blue?

1420
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:29,600
But then won't it mess up that one?

1421
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:32,960
Ok, blue.

1422
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:42,340
I did it!

1423
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:42,660
I did it!

1424
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:42,980
I did it!

1425
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:43,680
I did it!

1426
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:44,980
Ok, ok.

1427
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:49,220
Wait, does this work?

1428
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:50,320
Does this work?

1429
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,840
Ah!

1430
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,910
I don't get it!

1431
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:12,790
I don't get it!

1432
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:14,450
I don't...

1433
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:17,110
Oh my gosh!

1434
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:17,850
One more minute!

1435
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:24,030
No, no, no!

1436
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,750
Red...wait, I have to turn this off.

1437
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,910
Too much pressure!

1438
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:39,590
I'll definitely die.

1439
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:40,790
Ok, it's ok.

1440
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:47,020
No!

1441
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,200
Everyone, I'm sorry!

1442
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,000
Everyone!

1443
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,140
Can everyone hear me?

1444
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,340
Everyone, I'm sorry!

1445
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,260
I'm sorry!

1446
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:27,110
Why did you kill me?

1447
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:28,390
I'm an employee.

1448
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:31,050
Yeah, if you were a good guy.

1449
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:33,270
Oh, I thought you were...you shot me.

1450
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:36,170
No, you shot me first!

1451
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:39,690
Miscommunication.

1452
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:42,390
Everyone, I'll shoot and then we forgive each other, ok?

1453
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:44,170
After you forgive each other.

1454
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:55,800
Did I shoot first?

1455
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:57,660
Did I shoot first?

1456
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:00,740
Now we are friends again.

1457
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,940
Is 10 minutes quite long?

1458
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:06,540
I'll put it at 8 minutes.

1459
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,420
Honestly, we didn't all die.

1460
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:09,740
I think 10 minutes is pretty good.

1461
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:11,680
It was just because Mint was by herself.

1462
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:12,820
It felt like a long time.

1463
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:13,320
Sorry.

1464
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,540
No, it's ok.

1465
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:18,820
Mint,

1466
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:24,940
it's ok.

1467
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,560
Let's go by your...

1468
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,920
It looks like you are good at it.

1469
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:31,740
Ok,

1470
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:40,610
I'm an employee again.

1471
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:49,150
Delivery!

1472
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:52,430
Delivery!

1473
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:54,770
Delivery!

1474
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:02,470
It's green.

1475
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:12,290
They saw me.

1476
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:13,210
They saw me.

1477
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:17,090
Is this delivery?

1478
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:22,130
Look

1479
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:29,920
at the box.

1480
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,940
It has a green.

1481
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:34,960
It has a green.

1482
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:36,280
Where do I put it?

1483
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:36,660
In here?

1484
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,320
Delivery arrived!

1485
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:54,750
The power.

1486
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:56,770
Oh, we have to find the power, right?

1487
01:34:58,030 --> 01:35:00,870
Guys, I did a task properly for the first time.

1488
01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:04,650
Power, power, power, power.

1489
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:09,610
Look at their little faces!

1490
01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:13,550
That was not happy.

1491
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:28,310
I delivered.

1492
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:31,290
We did it!

1493
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:35,890
What was that?

1494
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:38,370
Wait, that was so fast.

1495
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:45,290
That was so fast!

1496
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:48,170
Yippee!

1497
01:35:50,230 --> 01:35:51,170
We are getting better?

1498
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:52,970
We are getting better.

1499
01:35:53,770 --> 01:35:56,010
Not me.

1500
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:59,370
It was one power.

1501
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:01,850
Let's go!

1502
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:03,970
I'm an employee again.

1503
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:05,830
Guys...

1504
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:11,950
Scanner!

1505
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:17,370
Scanner.

1506
01:36:18,810 --> 01:36:19,890
Scanner.

1507
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:21,630
Scanner.

1508
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:22,690
Scanner.

1509
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:26,090
Brain not braining.

1510
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:28,050
I'm losing power.

1511
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:33,190
Haah...

1512
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:33,610
Ready.

1513
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:36,990
I'm ready.

1514
01:36:38,150 --> 01:36:38,450
OK.

1515
01:36:40,570 --> 01:36:43,050
Right, right, right, right.

1516
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:45,830
Right, more right, more right.

1517
01:36:48,490 --> 01:36:49,630
Stop, stop, stop.

1518
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:51,810
A little left, a little left.

1519
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:54,030
A little left, a little left.

1520
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:55,290
A little left.

1521
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:55,670
Stop!

1522
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:57,710
A little right, a little right.

1523
01:36:57,710 --> 01:36:58,670
A little more.

1524
01:36:58,770 --> 01:36:59,650
A little more.

1525
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:04,830
OK, OK, OK.

1526
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:05,970
Perfect, perfect.

1527
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:07,150
A little more down, down.

1528
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:12,050
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

1529
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:12,770
Down, down.

1530
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:13,130
Stop!

1531
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:14,370
Ah, close!

1532
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:16,210
A little right, a little right.

1533
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:17,390
Right, up.

1534
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:19,950
A little left, a little left, a little left.

1535
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:23,610
Perfect.

1536
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:24,750
Nice.

1537
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:26,550
What should I do?

1538
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:28,090
It's over.

1539
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:28,510
Perfect.

1540
01:37:29,330 --> 01:37:31,810
Ah, so...

1541
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:33,930
We did scan!

1542
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:36,070
Nice.

1543
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:40,830
Computers.

1544
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:49,510
Guys, I'm gonna set up my waiting room for...

1545
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:52,510
For the direct.

1546
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:08,510
We'll set up the waiting room for the direct and the redirect into the direct.

1547
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:18,670
I'm min-maxing streaming right now.

1548
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:30,920
OK, after this stream we'll watch the direct and then I'll take a nap.

1549
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,040
Who killed Henya?

1550
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:51,880
Henya was the killer.

1551
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,980
Henya was the killer.

1552
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:54,800
I stopped her.

1553
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,080
Axel!

1554
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:57,920
Axel?

1555
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:01,380
It's Axel.

1556
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:06,140
Axel?

1557
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:07,840
I'm trying to do this here.

1558
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:08,760
I'm trying to do...

1559
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,080
Yo, yo, you gotta trust me yo.

1560
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:12,660
I don't know you!

1561
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,060
Wait, wait.

1562
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:14,700
Axel, Axel.

1563
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:15,280
Look at me.

1564
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,280
Look at your auntie in the eye.

1565
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:17,700
Look at your auntie in the eye.

1566
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,220
Was it you or was it Henya?

1567
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,700
Look at your auntie in the eye.

1568
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:24,480
Remember the video that we used to drink together?

1569
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,080
What is mama da yo?

1570
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,980
Remember the picture that you took with Oni bro?

1571
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:30,780
Did you do it?

1572
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:36,880
Where's the power?

1573
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,500
Did you get it?

1574
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:41,920
I don't know.

1575
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:43,320
He's gotta look in his eye.

1576
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:44,880
He's gotta look in his eye.

1577
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,780
I'm not it.

1578
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,360
I'm not it.

1579
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,880
You can kill me, but you're killing an innocent employee.

1580
01:39:58,900 --> 01:39:59,600
I'm innocent.

1581
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,380
Yeah, we're innocent.

1582
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:01,380
We're innocent.

1583
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:04,620
We're innocent.

1584
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:05,180
We're innocent.

1585
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:07,500
I told you man.

1586
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:08,400
I was innocent.

1587
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,000
Go get a new battery.

1588
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:14,940
He'll shoot.

1589
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:16,240
He'll shoot.

1590
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,480
Hey man, you need to calm down.

1591
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:23,260
You need to calm down.

1592
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,460
You need to calm down.

1593
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:25,800
I don't know if you're ready for that.

1594
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:27,280
That's a lot of responsibility.

1595
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:29,000
I don't know if you're ready for that kind of weapon.

1596
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:31,140
I don't have a battery!

1597
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,100
Not this one.

1598
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:39,640
The other one.

1599
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,020
Ok, ok.

1600
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:48,160
I got you.

1601
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:48,400
I'm following.

1602
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,160
I'm right behind you sir.

1603
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:49,940
I'm right behind you.

1604
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,620
I'm following.

1605
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,640
I'm keeping...

1606
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,620
I'm watching you.

1607
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:56,020
I'm watching.

1608
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,160
I'm gonna be behind you.

1609
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:10,240
I didn't...

1610
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:20,500
I was just making sure.

1611
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:27,740
Ok, very good.

1612
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:29,380
Nice!

1613
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:33,020
Wait, how?

1614
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,900
How did we win?

1615
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,280
We're so good at the game though!

1616
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:45,140
I got you.

1617
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:45,900
I got you.

1618
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:47,800
Cinema.

1619
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:50,200
You!

1620
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,340
What are you?

1621
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,260
What are you doing?

1622
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:10,420
I will leave you.

1623
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:22,200
This next...

1624
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,660
Kisa has to leave soon, right?

1625
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:26,380
So this next last game...

1626
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:33,900
I'm gonna make this count everybody.

1627
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:34,580
Last game!

1628
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:35,260
Last game!

1629
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:38,240
Let's go!

1630
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:40,820
Go hard mode!

1631
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:42,800
Hard mode now.

1632
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,220
We can do it!

1633
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:48,220
We can do it!

1634
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:50,260
We can do it!

1635
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:51,860
Let's do it!

1636
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,420
Employee.

1637
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:56,580
Ok.

1638
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:02,500
Pizushi!

1639
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,200
Pizushi...

1640
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:10,620
Pizushi.

1641
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:11,520
Pizushi.

1642
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,260
Oh I think we have to make it.

1643
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:16,620
Pizushi.

1644
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:17,180
Pizushi.

1645
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:18,640
Let's make it.

1646
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:19,300
Let's make it.

1647
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:20,280
Pizushi.

1648
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,140
Need rice.

1649
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:27,640
Need rice?

1650
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,100
Where is rice?

1651
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:30,180
Where do I get the rice?

1652
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:31,860
Rice.

1653
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,280
Rice.

1654
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:34,900
Where?

1655
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:37,340
What is this?

1656
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:38,440
What is this?

1657
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:39,740
Is this for the rice?

1658
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:43,840
Rice, rice, rice.

1659
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,100
We gotta find it!

1660
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:49,140
Pizushi!

1661
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,560
We need rice!

1662
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,840
Ok, maybe storage?

1663
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:05,380
Oh wait, do we make this?

1664
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,300
Black rice shrimp.

1665
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,320
We need rice!

1666
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,340
We need rice!

1667
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:12,060
Rice, rice.

1668
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:13,820
Rice, rice, rice.

1669
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:22,800
Nice, nice, nice.

1670
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,480
Rice, rice, rice.

1671
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:27,600
Nice, rice.

1672
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:30,740
Wait,

1673
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,420
can you put that on there?

1674
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:39,840
The container.

1675
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:43,180
Ok.

1676
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,120
Oh ok.

1677
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:51,000
Nice, nice.

1678
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:52,800
Nice, nice, nice.

1679
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,120
Nice, nice, nice.

1680
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:02,120
Oh we need fish!

1681
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:04,030
Fish!

1682
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:06,360
Fish!

1683
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:08,920
Fish!

1684
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:12,900
Oh nice, nice.

1685
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,380
Looks tasty.

1686
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:28,760
Topping, topping, topping.

1687
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,560
The school rice.

1688
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,840
Oh wait, it's a good thing we got the right rice.

1689
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:51,280
We got lucky.

1690
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:53,340
Topping!

1691
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:03,740
Topping, right?

1692
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,680
It looks kind of leafy.

1693
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:06,560
Right?

1694
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:08,380
Probably.

1695
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:11,820
Maybe in this area there is a topping.

1696
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:15,180
Maybe.

1697
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:16,760
Topping.

1698
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:18,140
What kind of topping?

1699
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:19,940
Topping.

1700
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:23,380
Oh, this computer?

1701
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:24,260
What do I do here?

1702
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:32,620
B04.

1703
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:36,180
Me as a topping?

1704
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,300
What are you talking about?

1705
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,100
Don't say silly things you guys.

1706
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:44,120
If I were an imposter I would sit here.

1707
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:50,280
If I was an imposter, I would just wait here.

1708
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,520
I'm looking for topping.

1709
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,020
Looking for topping!

1710
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:01,960
The what?

1711
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,700
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

1712
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:10,860
Oh, this?

1713
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:20,360
Oh no!

1714
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:26,300
Is that a shrimp?

1715
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,980
It's a shrimp.

1716
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:35,340
Oh no!

1717
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,340
Well, it's fine.

1718
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:41,380
It's fine, it's fine.

1719
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,620
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1720
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,300
It's fine, it's fine.

1721
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:56,340
Yeah, it hit me.

1722
01:47:56,380 --> 01:47:57,580
You almost killed me.

1723
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:02,700
It exploded.

1724
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:03,960
It was an imposter.

1725
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,740
No, don't be picky.

1726
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:10,720
Don't be picky.

1727
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:21,260
We have to find more rice maybe.

1728
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,040
And then...

1729
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:30,780
What's that?

1730
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:35,340
This one, this one.

1731
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:37,140
I got it.

1732
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:39,740
It's empty.

1733
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:44,380
We need the shrimp, we need the shrimp.

1734
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,140
Why doesn't it work?

1735
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,140
Container not clean.

1736
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:48,880
Oh, what?

1737
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,240
We need the rice.

1738
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:59,280
Clean the box?

1739
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:00,440
Okay.

1740
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:02,560
Clean the box?

1741
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:03,660
How?

1742
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:09,000
Clean it?

1743
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:09,560
How?

1744
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:15,750
Oh, go to the washroom.

1745
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:17,790
Washroom?

1746
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:22,170
There is no washroom.

1747
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:22,870
Oh wait.

1748
01:49:24,730 --> 01:49:25,190
Maybe...

1749
01:49:25,870 --> 01:49:26,930
Is there a sink?

1750
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:34,390
A green area.

1751
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:39,030
No, it's okay.

1752
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:40,810
I think I just have to clean this.

1753
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:42,270
Oh, here, here, here.

1754
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:42,830
Where are you?

1755
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:54,670
I have to clean the container.

1756
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:55,310
Me too!

1757
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:57,150
But I don't know where.

1758
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:00,910
Oh I see, I see, I see.

1759
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:01,430
Right here.

1760
01:50:02,610 --> 01:50:03,370
The washing machine.

1761
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:19,330
I might be a little late for the direct guy, sorry.

1762
01:50:21,450 --> 01:50:22,710
We'll probably gonna die.

1763
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:23,890
No, probably.

1764
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:25,330
But we'll make pizushi.

1765
01:50:26,450 --> 01:50:27,750
Pizushi, pizushi.

1766
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:30,830
Pizushi, pizushi.

1767
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:33,790
Okay, now we can have rice.

1768
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:41,140
We need shrimp.

1769
01:50:50,570 --> 01:50:51,770
Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp!

1770
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:54,950
Pizushi, pizushi.

1771
01:50:55,210 --> 01:50:56,330
You have the other plant?

1772
01:50:58,170 --> 01:51:00,090
Nice, nice, nice.

1773
01:51:05,790 --> 01:51:06,970
Pizushi, pizushi.

1774
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:08,310
Oh, shrimp, shrimp, shrimp.

1775
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:08,470
It became shrimp.

1776
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:11,930
It became shrimp, it became shrimp.

1777
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:22,550
I did it!

1778
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:23,850
I did it!

1779
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:26,890
Nice one, nice one!

1780
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:41,250
It came to me!

1781
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:42,410
The odd imposter!

1782
01:51:47,790 --> 01:51:49,830
This guy is lying.

1783
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:54,070
Don't lie, everyone.

1784
01:51:55,590 --> 01:51:56,810
I don't know how to do this.

1785
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:00,190
I have no idea too.

1786
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:05,150
I think FBH and Sojo is imposter.

1787
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:07,650
I think so.

1788
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:10,270
Computer, yes?

1789
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:15,850
I don't have power.

1790
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:17,590
Power

1791
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:33,200
Self -Defense Self-Defense!

1792
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,700
Self-Defense!

1793
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:37,540
He has a knife!

1794
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:39,160
He has a knife!

1795
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:43,540
No, no, no

1796
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,240
It's over!

1797
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:09,140
It's over!

1798
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:10,280
It's over!

1799
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,980
You are not the one that has to do the math!

1800
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:15,220
You were spreading them?

1801
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:16,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1802
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:19,680
I have to kill you though.

1803
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:20,500
I have to kill you.

1804
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:21,800
Stop!

1805
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:25,220
Stop!

1806
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:28,320
I knew Gary would have just died from running.

1807
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,980
Sojo also bad.

1808
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,520
I knew you would have died just from running.

1809
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:34,000
Wait, what's the sound?

1810
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:38,060
No, no, no I knew you would have just died.

1811
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:43,720
I want you to kill me.

1812
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:45,740
I don't have power.

1813
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:49,760
I don't know how to do this.

1814
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:52,640
I don't know how to do this.

1815
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:53,900
I have no idea.

1816
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,200
I don't know how to do this.

1817
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,300
I don't know how to do this.

1818
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:02,480
Thank you guys so much.

1819
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:03,260
Thank you!

1820
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:14,320
Thank you!

1821
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:18,980
Thank you!

1822
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:29,520
Thank you!

1823
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,120
Thank you so much!

1824
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:32,240
Thank you!

1825
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:34,440
Arigato!

1826
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:42,160
Bye bye!

1827
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:48,640
Let's play again!

1828
01:54:50,380 --> 01:54:51,360
Bye bye!

1829
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,240
Bye bye!

1830
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:58,180
Wait, how do I leave?

1831
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,020
Ok guys!

1832
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:02,300
Thank you!

1833
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,580
Ok, I'm sorry.

1834
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:06,760
I'm gonna run so fast and I'm gonna raid the next room.

1835
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:07,980
Bye bye!

1836
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,040
Raid into the wreck!

1837
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:09,720
Raid into the wreck!

1838
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:10,120
Bye bye!
