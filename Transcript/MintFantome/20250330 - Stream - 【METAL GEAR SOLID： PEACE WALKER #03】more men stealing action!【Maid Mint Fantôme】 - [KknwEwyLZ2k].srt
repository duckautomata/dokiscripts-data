00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,200
Welcome back, Master Bart!

2
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,260
Hello, everybody!

3
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,360
Do you like the intro?

4
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,920
Do you like the intro?

5
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,400
Hello, welcome, welcome, welcome in!

6
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,780
Welcome back to Metal Gear Solid PS4!

7
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,200
Apparently last night...

8
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,140
I don't remember posting that.

9
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,060
I think maybe I became possessed.

10
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,580
I don't know.

11
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,700
But I...

12
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,640
I posted that.

13
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,200
I'm like thinking, when...

14
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,360
What got me to post that?

15
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,520
Any alcohol?

16
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,000
No, I don't drink.

17
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,420
Hmm...

18
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,240
Mysterious.

19
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,840
You've got a great intro.

20
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,220
No problem, thank you so much for the 10 gifts.

21
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,820
Thank you!

22
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,020
Who is this piece and why we're walking them?

23
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,860
Actually, let's pause.

24
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,760
Yeah, you've got a great butt.

25
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,060
Yeah, that's what Solid Snake says.

26
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,860
Yeah...

27
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,400
Yeah...

28
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,240
I blame you for what 4MeFeed has been like on Twitter this morning.

29
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,080
What do you mean?

30
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,620
You create your own 4U, no?

31
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,240
It's 4U!

32
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,800
Not 4Me, not because of me.

33
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,640
It's 4U!

34
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,420
It's literally in the name!

35
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,180
It's not me!

36
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,300
Nah, 4U, the viewer.

37
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,780
Anyway, I'm going to be 100% honest with you guys.

38
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,100
I think I've overworked a little bit.

39
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,380
And I am so tired.

40
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,160
And I...

41
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,140
I'm so tired of...

42
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,280
I had another meeting this morning.

43
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,520
And so I...

44
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,280
Right now, I'm on like maybe...

45
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,800
40% energy.

46
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
So...

47
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,240
Shut up!

48
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,920
I don't need your sass!

49
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,620
God, you're so rude!

50
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,140
My voice is dead because of pollen.

51
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,700
Hate you.

52
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,620
God, ViviCore, thank you so much for the gift.

53
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,900
And don't hate you.

54
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,360
So...

55
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,680
I can't wait to be carried by...

56
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,800
In this game again.

57
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,960
And...

58
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,560
Oh man, I really just want to close my eyes and sleep.

59
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,680
But I don't.

60
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,560
Because I have another collab tonight.

61
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,300
But...

62
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,320
So...

63
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,480
Thank you so much for the 20 gifts.

64
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,040
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

65
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,440
Pollen is a real struggle.

66
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,000
I need to stop going outside.

67
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,320
The butt eater.

68
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,240
No, no, no.

69
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,740
Unless...

70
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,840
Unless...

71
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,860
I'm trading some rank B guys if you want them.

72
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,760
You're trading your men like Pokemon cards.

73
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,140
When are you and Snake getting married?

74
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,120
We're gonna get married...

75
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,280
We're gonna get married...

76
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,540
We're gonna get married...

77
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,020
At the wedding.

78
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,300
When the priest says, does anyone object?

79
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,000
Speak now, forever hold your peace.

80
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,780
Someone's gonna say me.

81
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,600
And of course it's gonna be Revolver Ocelot walking through the door.

82
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,700
He's gonna be spinning his little guns and he's gonna say, I object.

83
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,620
And then he's gonna take Snake away.

84
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,400
And I'm gonna be like, oh my god.

85
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,160
Who could have seen this happening?

86
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,700
And then...

87
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,340
I'll be like, oh but...

88
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,960
It's for the best, that's what I'll think.

89
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,820
If you love him, let him go.

90
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,300
If he comes back to you...

91
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,420
He wanted to stay, but he doesn't come back.

92
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
It was just meant to be, the two of them.

93
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,940
I'll be Miss Haversham for the rest of my afterlife.

94
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,340
Well, in this scenario I'm probably alive.

95
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,440
I'll be Miss Haversham for the rest of my life.

96
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,680
And I'll be like, sitting in my mansion with my old wedding cake on the table.

97
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,300
Be like, one day Snake will come back to me.

98
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,580
I was not expecting NTR Yaoi Fan Fiction Live on stream today.

99
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,300
It's not fan fiction, this is real.

100
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,540
This is what will actually happen...

101
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,860
When Snake and I get married.

102
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,500
Maybe Solid Snake will comfort me, it really just depends.

103
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,120
I don't know.

104
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,860
I'm not a mind reader.

105
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm not a psychic, I can't tell the future.

106
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,620
Congratulations on my divorce.

107
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,580
On my divorce RTA.

108
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:26,780
lol

109
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,680
Congrats on getting left at the altar by your OTP.

110
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,860
Yeah, honestly, I think it would be like an honor for me to be like...

111
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,500
Well, at least my OTP is happy.

112
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,420
I guess it's...

113
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,140
What happened to Psycho Mintus?

114
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:58,920
Dead.

115
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,460
This is your pharmacist speaking.

116
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,020
You forgot to pick up your meds.

117
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,220
Oopsie!

118
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Oh, wait, I winked but you couldn't tell.

119
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,300
Because I'm wearing an iPad.

120
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,650
It's your boy.

121
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,510
Tell Raiden's birthday yesterday.

122
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,290
Jeff!

123
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,690
Instead of traditional MGS, can I get Happy Birthday to you?

124
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,870
You live in a zoo, you look like a minky and you smell like one too.

125
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,470
Jeff!

126
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,590
Towel Raiden!

127
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,710
Oh my god!

128
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,770
Happy Birthday to you.

129
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,750
You live in a zoo.

130
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,930
You look like a minky and you smell like one too.

131
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,670
Happy Birthday!

132
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,910
Are you gonna be Towel Raiden again at MGS Con?

133
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,930
Don't come to my panel wearing that, please.

134
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,130
Please don't.

135
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,790
Don't do it again, please.

136
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,550
Don't come to my panel wearing that.

137
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,940
Jeff, you got it.

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,160
No, please don't.

139
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,380
Anyway.

140
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,840
Welcome back to Metal Gear Piece Walker.

141
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,680
Let's load the game so we're not just listening to...

142
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,360
I played a little bit off stream.

143
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,620
Let me show you some updates everybody.

144
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,160
Important updates.

145
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,880
Thank you boss.

146
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,700
Maybe Off Guy.

147
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,140
Maybe MGS Guy.

148
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,720
Off Guy?

149
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,960
What?

150
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
Off Guy?

151
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
I have some people.

152
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,140
Oh no, where did I put him?

153
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,900
Wait, he's here.

154
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,200
Somewhere.

155
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,180
He's here somewhere.

156
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,970
Hold on.

157
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:49,710
Hold.

158
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:49,790
Hold.

159
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,310
Hold.

160
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,250
Hold.

161
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,450
Hold.

162
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,510
Oh wait, what did I just do with him?

163
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,410
Wait, Ant?

164
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,590
I lost Ant.

165
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,650
Wait, Ant?

166
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,950
Ant?

167
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,170
Wait, where did he go?

168
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,350
Ant?

169
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,170
I lost Ant.

170
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,810
I lost Ant.

171
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,460
Ant!

172
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,790
Ant!

173
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,030
No!

174
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,140
What did I press?

175
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,860
I accidentally pressed A.

176
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,400
This guy is kinda good.

177
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:50,960
Hold on.

178
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,780
No he's not.

179
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,660
Nevermind.

180
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,420
Oh, I just got rid of him too.

181
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,980
Where did I put them?

182
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,580
In combat.

183
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,420
Oh there he is.

184
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,560
No, go back to the waiting room.

185
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,040
Who was the other guy I just got rid of?

186
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,540
Was it you?

187
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,400
No?

188
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,130
Whatever, it's fine.

189
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,770
Nidorgar Salad Tree.

190
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,630
Close.

191
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,450
I thought I literally just released them into the wild.

192
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,530
I was like, that's not possible.

193
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,830
Oh look, this is...

194
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,970
This is Nimi Nightmare.

195
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:41,830
I know.

196
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,990
Combat Sambo.

197
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,270
CQC?

198
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,550
This I gotta see.

199
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,310
Nimi Nightmare is not very good, unfortunately.

200
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,390
Her stats are actually quite low.

201
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,330
It's our man!

202
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,670
Leech!

203
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,300
Leech is also... He's pretty good at eating.

204
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,160
He's actually... I think he has better stats than the last time I got Leech.

205
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,820
So, yippee!

206
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,620
I've been recruiting some guys.

207
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,480
I've been making some weapons.

208
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,520
And stuff.

209
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,880
Look, look, I'm working on things.

210
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,140
I'm making things.

211
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,380
Oh wait, I don't want to recruit some anymore.

212
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,440
What do you call a fake spaghetti?

213
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,980
An impasta!

214
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,040
Yeah, we're making progress.

215
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,580
But today, we play more.

216
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,760
Oh, and I did some... Hold on, let me show some side missions.

217
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,920
I did just a few.

218
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,120
Let's see.

219
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,880
Let's see, let's see.

220
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,340
The extra ops.

221
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,040
I didn't do all of them.

222
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,420
I only did a few.

223
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,240
Oh gosh, I'm in bad trouble if I keep going on it like this.

224
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,320
I didn't feel like doing any of the marksmanships.

225
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,660
I did like the Fulton recovery.

226
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,260
Oh, I only have this one, no?

227
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,240
Oh, obstacle demolition.

228
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:26,800
This one too.

229
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,320
I'm not doing this.

230
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,260
We can do this one as a team maybe.

231
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,140
But we're back here.

232
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,460
Wow!

233
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,200
Alex is out.

234
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,980
Thank you so much for the Haka Super.

235
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,280
What?

236
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,080
Age is 26.

237
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,040
I never intended to get into the Metal Gear series, but after just beating MGS1 for the first time like 10 minutes ago...

238
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,880
The series has another fan.

239
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,920
Hope you're proud of yourself.

240
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,660
I used your playthrough win stack.

241
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,580
Thank you!

242
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,980
Oh my gosh!

243
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,360
Thank you, thank you!

244
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,680
One of us.

245
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,060
Metal Gear.

246
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,940
Well, spoilers maybe if you only just beat MGS1.

247
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,470
Yeah, thank you so much for the Haka Super.

248
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,550
Really appreciate it.

249
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,250
I just got a dono, but I don't know if it was Murphy's or Gary.

250
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,390
Anyway, thanks both of you.

251
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,070
Okay, so we just beat Chrysalis.

252
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,950
We met Strangelove last time.

253
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,090
We met...

254
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,810
Last time we beat Pupa.

255
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,670
We're about to travel to the mine base because we gotta...

256
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,490
Oh, we're already here!

257
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,610
Oh my gosh, wait!

258
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,990
Oh my gosh, I just noticed where we are.

259
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:06,530
Head for the enemy's mine base and prevent the assembly of the Mammal Pod and Peace Walker!

260
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,830
Yeah baby, yeah baby, yeah!

261
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,850
So, as usual I'm playing on the Xbox.

262
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,210
If you wanna join me?

263
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,290
Come play with me.

264
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,490
Yeah, we did read Huey's love letter.

265
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,590
Poor guy.

266
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,750
Okey-dokey.

267
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:43,930
Global?

268
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,210
Come on in!

269
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,490
Anybody wanna join?

270
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,110
Come on in, come on in.

271
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,770
Snake!

272
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,050
Wow, we have Snake.

273
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,690
Wow, we have Snake.

274
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,930
What do I have?

275
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,450
This should be fine.

276
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,710
This should be good.

277
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,830
Are we ready?

278
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,810
I think so.

279
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,670
Yeah, I think we're ready.

280
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,590
Unless...

281
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:24,690
Unless...

282
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,530
Nah, I'm going with the team.

283
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,190
Are we ready?

284
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,810
Let's go baby!

285
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,010
Are you planning on playing the MGS Delta Snake Eater?

286
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:39,650
Of course!

287
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,770
Why would I not play Snake Eater?

288
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,130
After watching your stream, I really got into the series.

289
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,690
Have a good stream.

290
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,770
Thank you, Bald!

291
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,770
Thank you, thank you.

292
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,330
Thanks for the spoiler alert.

293
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,090
I'll catch the VOD.

294
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:54,850
Horsey.

295
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,570
We have a horse girl in our midst?

296
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,010
Chapter 3!

297
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,970
A nation reborn.

298
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,780
Snake.

299
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,020
How's the horse doing?

300
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,520
Not too bad.

301
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,840
You'd never know he was over 20 years old.

302
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,860
He was hers after all.

303
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Seems like some part of her became a part of him.

304
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,720
Horse girl.

305
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,900
The platform and the cerebral AI are supposed to be assembled at an underground base disguised as a mine.

306
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,160
If my guess is right, both of them have already arrived and are being readied for final testing.

307
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,920
My boy.

308
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,160
OK!

309
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,720
My Peace Walker.

310
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,560
Uma Musume Crossover?

311
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,000
For what reason?

312
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,660
Destroying the AI.

313
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,440
Oh yeah.

314
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,080
Hello.

315
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,900
Hello, hello, hello.

316
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,400
I'm going up.

317
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,320
Get me.

318
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,480
I'm getting the upper.

319
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,440
There's a guy right there.

320
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,400
I'll get his butt.

321
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,860
I didn't get his butt.

322
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,960
I got his head.

323
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,720
Oh no, don't call.

324
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:36,980
I got him.

325
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:39,960
Thanks.

326
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,100
Oh my gosh, he fell asleep.

327
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,760
Did you see that?

328
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,520
He literally collapsed to the ground.

329
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,780
What are you getting?

330
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,560
Don't worry about it.

331
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,060
They're going to be stuck in a loop.

332
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,860
I got his butt.

333
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,040
He's fine.

334
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:07,440
See?

335
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:07,660
See?

336
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,200
We're fine everybody.

337
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,220
Rise and shine.

338
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,820
I see a guy over there.

339
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,760
No co-op out.

340
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,880
I might have messed up.

341
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,580
Shoot.

342
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,900
Take his butt.

343
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,040
Down.

344
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,900
Good job.

345
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,740
What if I take him out?

346
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,060
We'll be fine.

347
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,560
We'll be fine most likely.

348
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,260
Hey, where are you friend?

349
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,580
Snake!

350
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:49,640
Snake!

351
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,980
Oh there you are.

352
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,140
Hi.

353
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,980
All clear!

354
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,980
Is that guy on the roof?

355
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,420
What's he doing up there?

356
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:01,740
What?

357
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,020
Oh.

358
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,940
I'll get him too.

359
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,680
I'll get him too.

360
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,820
Oh, I didn't get him.

361
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,440
Oh,

362
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,100
this guy is still here.

363
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,540
Let me get him.

364
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,120
Hey!

365
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,480
Go to sleep!

366
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
What if I...

367
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,060
I have magazines.

368
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:43,620
Wait!

369
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,000
He didn't look at it.

370
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,920
No, no.

371
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,200
Come here.

372
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,700
Come here.

373
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,740
Can I pick you up?

374
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:55,720
Come here.

375
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,080
Come here.

376
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,340
Come here.

377
00:24:59,500 --> 00:24:59,860
Wake up.

378
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,660
Wake up.

379
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,060
Wake up.

380
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,720
Wait.

381
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,020
Hold on.

382
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,640
Oh, I think I hear somebody.

383
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,700
A prisoner?

384
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,860
Wait Snake!

385
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,860
We got to go get the prisoner.

386
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,900
We got to go get the prisoner.

387
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,320
No!

388
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,160
No!

389
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,980
Shut up guys!

390
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,120
We got to go get the prisoner.

391
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,240
It's fine.

392
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,320
You want the magazine?

393
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,300
That I'm holding.

394
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,220
Thanks!

395
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,980
I'll take him home.

396
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,220
He has good eyes.

397
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,840
He has good eyes.

398
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,640
Wait.

399
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,440
I want to jump into the hay.

400
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,900
Where... Wait.

401
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,440
Hold on.

402
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,080
Everybody.

403
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,360
How do you get up there?

404
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,140
How do you get up there?

405
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,060
Hey Snake.

406
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,660
Show me the way.

407
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,020
Show me the way Snake.

408
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,820
Through here?

409
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:14,660
No.

410
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,060
OK.

411
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,100
We are going the long way.

412
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:16,800
OK.

413
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,180
We are going the longest way.

414
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:18,860
OK.

415
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,300
We are going the long, long way.

416
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:20,760
Oh.

417
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,220
There we go.

418
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,140
Let's go into the hay.

419
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,020
Yeah.

420
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,270
OK.

421
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,590
Here we go!

422
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,370
No!

423
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,210
You made it!

424
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,930
You made it!

425
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,050
You made it!

426
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,290
There it goes.

427
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,890
It's my birthday today.

428
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,190
What just happened?

429
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,570
It's not too bad.

430
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,510
It's going to...

431
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,250
Ooga booga caveman style.

432
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,870
Cave mentor birthday.

433
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,810
He's going to go read the magazine.

434
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,590
Oh no!

435
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,390
There's a guy again.

436
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,510
Look at him.

437
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,770
He's so in love.

438
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,650
You got him.

439
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,670
Dang.

440
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,590
Yours are strong.

441
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,170
What should I do with him?

442
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,950
Yeah.

443
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:56,470
What do you guys think?

444
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,730
You think I'm here because I want to be?

445
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,230
OK.

446
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,110
You're not coming home with me.

447
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,270
You're not coming home with... OK.

448
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:06,770
Let's go Snake.

449
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,310
Let's go Snake.

450
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,910
He doesn't even want to be here.

451
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,090
Where did that guy come from though?

452
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,690
Mystery.

453
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,870
Happy birthday though!

454
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,630
I think he just stayed there until...Oh we never grabbed him.

455
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,150
But we successfully used the magazine.

456
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,710
Loud.

457
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,210
Peace Walker!

458
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,090
Stinking kidnappers.

459
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,450
Cipher.

460
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,690
It's a sniper battle everybody.

461
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,450
Senplex, thank you so much for the sand gifted.

462
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,210
Thank you!

463
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,470
Oh there's so many.

464
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:09,630
You ready?

465
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,870
You ready for this?

466
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,170
In the next chapter?

467
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:20,510
In the next mission?

468
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,510
Sniper.

469
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,620
We got three new guys.

470
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,600
Let's go.

471
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,100
Skip.

472
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,400
I actually don't... Is it...

473
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,300
Just the guy?

474
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,220
It's just the guys for the next one though.

475
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
I think so.

476
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,620
I think.

477
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,020
Yeah, it's so nice that the snipers are the only... Truly, right?

478
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:05,940
Skip.

479
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,720
These are all the new things that we made.

480
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:08,980
Skip.

481
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Alright, let's add our new guys in.

482
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,280
Are you guys any good?

483
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:14,820
Gerbil.

484
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,640
I wish I could see the Loch Ness Monster or Quetzalcoatl once in my life.

485
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:21,740
Yammu!

486
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,600
We got her.

487
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,000
Wait, is she the... Oh the POW is a lady!

488
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,740
I used to work in the kitchen.

489
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,660
Whether it's guns or knives, just leave it to me.

490
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,880
Do you need a gun in the kitchen?

491
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,020
Ma'am, what does your kitchen experience have to do with...

492
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,680
Have to do with anything!

493
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Megamouth Shark and Eagle Ray.

494
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,440
Very good team.

495
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,400
It's a tough kitchen.

496
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,740
Oh yeah, better to be safe than sorry.

497
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,280
So true.

498
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,960
I don't think we had anything to develop.

499
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,320
Or I mean, obviously we have a ton, but...

500
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,680
So...

501
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,220
I got the strike mark...

502
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,860
The strike marker 2?

503
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:14,780
Rank 2?

504
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,680
Before getting the rank 1.

505
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,580
Let's do...

506
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,880
I'm not gonna have any of these for the next mission, but...

507
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,300
They call it Hell's Kitchen.

508
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,500
I was... I've been getting recommended Hell's Kitchen.

509
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,460
Like the official YouTube channel.

510
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,060
Recently.

511
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,180
And so, they put up like really long episodes.

512
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,560
Like really long videos, so I'll put them on to sleep.

513
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,560
But oh my gosh, I cannot sleep with it because it's like...

514
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,420
The intro is just like...

515
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,640
It's so loud, it's like...

516
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,440
And I'm like, shut up!

517
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,540
I'm trying to sleep!

518
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:02,980
Gargoyle!

519
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,080
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

520
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,840
Thank you.

521
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,060
It's my day... of birth!

522
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:14,420
I don't need a song, I just want to say thanks for many hours of fun and I hope I can keep watching you be freaky for many years!

523
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
Fluffiness, thank you!

524
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,040
Happy birthday!

525
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,940
Are you sure you don't want a song?

526
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,220
Are you sure you don't want a song?

527
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,030
Eliminate the guards.

528
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,790
Take them out before they take you out.

529
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:46,370
OK!

530
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,310
Alright, anybody wanting to play?

531
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,310
Take out the guards!

532
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,210
Come on in!

533
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,410
I think I've forgotten the basics of CQC but...

534
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,710
No you haven't!

535
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,710
Don't say that!

536
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,650
Who's in?

537
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,710
Rooks!

538
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:08,910
Welcome, welcome.

539
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,470
Let's see.

540
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,910
Do I need...

541
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,660
This is my sniper, but should I bring my...

542
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,440
Thank you everyone!

543
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,380
Should I bring a regular gun for the kidnappers and stuff?

544
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,760
You can non-lethal this if you want.

545
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,260
But the kidnappers, no?

546
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
They're kind of annoying.

547
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,960
Maybe we'll bring the sniper for the guards.

548
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,420
And then like...

549
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,760
M60 for the...

550
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,140
For the little drone guys.

551
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,800
They'll be too far to fall in.

552
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,860
I can run over there!

553
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,780
I think this is good.

554
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,240
Will you play Peace Walker again in the future?

555
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,600
I'm not able to play right now.

556
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,780
I mean, I will play...

557
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,340
Once we beat it.

558
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,440
I'll play until we beat it.

559
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,680
But I have no plans on... Maybe like as a members thing.

560
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,680
I suppose.

561
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:34,720
I suppose.

562
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,680
Like if we wanted to redo missions.

563
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,320
But I don't have any plans to go back through it again.

564
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,960
At least not the story, you know.

565
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,420
Probably like that.

566
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,020
Refight bosses.

567
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,700
True.

568
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,150
We were... It's not our fault we were spotted.

569
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,710
It's just...

570
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,010
It's not... I mean, maybe it is our fault.

571
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,670
We were just standing right out in the open.

572
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,210
No!

573
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,890
Stupid drone.

574
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,230
Oh my gosh, we're literally just sitting ducks.

575
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,580
Bom-bom.

576
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,260
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom.

577
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,040
OK.

578
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,240
Alright.

579
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,420
Alright, rooks.

580
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,600
I... I missed.

581
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,940
I wish I had some...

582
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,220
I got him.

583
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,100
Ouch.

584
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,500
Where are you getting me from?

585
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,710
Oh my gosh.

586
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,110
A little guy almost got me.

587
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:29,850
No!

588
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,930
Why is my aim so bad?

589
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,510
I'm reloading.

590
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,250
He's running.

591
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,690
Oh, dammit.

592
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,970
Why did I think that would work?

593
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:46,810
Oh,

594
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,560
you should be asleep by now.

595
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,420
I'm going for him.

596
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,860
I'm going for him.

597
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,640
Stop!

598
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,500
Where

599
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,170
are you?

600
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,030
Rooks!

601
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,830
Oh, there you are.

602
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,410
Let's take out some...

603
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,550
I got him.

604
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,330
What did you get?

605
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,530
Wait, what did you get?

606
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,540
Wait, where are they?

607
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,640
Where are they?

608
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,180
Such tiny little men.

609
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:38,960
Hello?

610
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,440
People?

611
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:40,940
People?

612
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,560
Where are they?

613
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,580
Oh, there they are.

614
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,580
Oh, they're coming up!

615
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,480
Oh my god!

616
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,020
Hold on.

617
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,520
I'm going to leave a magazine for them.

618
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,400
Nevermind.

619
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,520
You got this.

620
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,980
I'm going to also throw a...

621
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,840
I threw one too!

622
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,510
No!

623
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,570
No, no, that's me!

624
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,470
I'm getting kidnapped!

625
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:15,790
No!

626
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,930
You stinking...where did it go?

627
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,390
No, no.

628
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,330
No, no, I'm on the wrong thing.

629
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,690
There we go.

630
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,280
Oh, was that you?

631
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,160
Wait, who are you?

632
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,200
Oh, he's dead.

633
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,180
Wait, who are you?

634
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,340
Where did you come from?

635
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,000
Yeah!

636
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,960
Take him down!

637
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:39,920
Yeah!

638
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,260
Bring him home!

639
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,460
Did I just kill a man?

640
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,800
My bad.

641
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,160
Wait a second.

642
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,880
I turned off notifications on Xbox.

643
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,760
What the hell happened?

644
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,500
No.

645
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,800
My bad.

646
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,980
Oh, when did they get that?

647
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,960
Oh, that's not good.

648
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,600
That's not...what is he...this guy is like shimmying away.

649
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,240
This guy is like doing the shimmy for real.

650
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,860
I don't have any fireworks!

651
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,040
I don't have any!

652
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,920
Stop running!

653
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,500
Stop running!

654
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,700
Damn it.

655
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,780
Oh, damn it.

656
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,500
Oops.

657
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,020
Don't shoot me please.

658
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,180
Ouch.

659
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,860
I really asked politely.

660
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,780
How are you awake again?

661
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,920
I need to eat some of my curry.

662
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,570
So...

663
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,150
Come

664
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,580
here.

665
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,080
Come here.

666
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,400
Come here.

667
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,950
Where is everybody?

668
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,310
Oh, there is a guy.

669
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,610
Is that for me?

670
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,390
Oh, I took it.

671
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:28,930
Thank you!

672
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,850
I can't see anything now.

673
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,850
Game, I can't see.

674
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:32,830
Game, please.

675
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,350
Here they come.

676
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,530
More men!

677
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,310
More wisdom for the cause.

678
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,450
Where is...

679
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,430
Oh, they are on their way here.

680
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,650
Let's just wait for them, no?

681
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,930
We can CQC them, no?

682
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,030
I'll also throw a smoke grenade.

683
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,490
No!

684
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,050
Don't shoot!

685
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,840
You know you want to!

686
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,780
Come home!

687
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,340
Come home!

688
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,160
Is this guy dead?

689
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,300
What's wrong with you?

690
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,280
He just faded out of existence!

691
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,660
What just happened?

692
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,780
It had a green skull over them though.

693
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,320
What happened?

694
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,160
Where is this mononoke?

695
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,480
Have fun Josh!

696
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,060
He was a ghost.

697
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,320
Don't...

698
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,520
Not yet!

699
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,240
I should have gotten him.

700
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

701
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,980
Where did that come from?

702
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,180
Oh you mister...

703
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,560
Oh you got him!

704
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:51,880
Wow!

705
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,780
Good job Rooks!

706
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,520
Good job!

707
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,600
0 out of 24!

708
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:07,820
24!

709
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,810
We did it!

710
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,570
Easy peasy.

711
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,270
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

712
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:24,570
Alright, come on.

713
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,050
What's that sound?

714
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,070
It's not a good sound.

715
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,070
This guy is a big, big boy.

716
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,650
I don't understand.

717
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,910
This seems like the worst of the prototypes, no?

718
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:07,830
I feel like Chrysalis is the best one.

719
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,790
It's like so portable and fast.

720
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,930
This one is just a big clunky... Look at how slow he is!

721
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,770
They like progressed in technology.

722
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,780
Oh, I said cocoon again.

723
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:28,840
Cocoon!

724
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,680
Where was... Wait.

725
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,520
Gosh, they are so confusing.

726
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,840
I don't know biology.

727
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,580
Which comes first?

728
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,480
Sometimes size matters.

729
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,540
I mean he's got a lot of bullets on him.

730
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,060
And he's got a chainsaw.

731
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:55,940
Oh, cocoon!

732
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,800
OK, so it was Chrysalis and then cocoon.

733
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,180
Such a fun way to experience this game.

734
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,300
Thanks Rooks!

735
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,640
Thanks for playing with me!

736
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,380
The little chainsaw on a string is so funny.

737
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,080
Yeah!

738
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,380
We got 9 guys.

739
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,020
Let's go.

740
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,640
Compensation for something?

741
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,080
I don't know.

742
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,800
Let's get our guys.

743
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,940
And maybe this time we can do the strike...

744
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,100
Anti-tank mod.

745
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:41,820
Nice.

746
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:43,860
Analyzer.

747
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,580
A delivery!

748
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,000
Uh-oh, hair.

749
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,380
Girl.

750
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,360
What did I get?

751
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,540
Oops.

752
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,270
Did you get me?

753
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,590
This is the worst ever.

754
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,710
It was all empty mags.

755
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,290
Oops all mags.

756
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,230
Oh my god.

757
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:35,370
Chimpanzee.

758
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,490
The gibbon.

759
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,790
Gibbon trash.

760
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,870
I'm pretty tired so I might pass out, but if you do have full permission to put me over to your place...

761
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,090
Oh no, I feel asleep.

762
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,510
What are your stats?

763
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,410
It's not so easy.

764
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:57,410
I'm not running a daycare over here.

765
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,450
Throw it at cocoon.

766
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,870
I'm gonna take only...

767
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,870
Only that with me.

768
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:06,010
Let's see.

769
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,390
Is there anything that we could take?

770
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,210
No, I'll take the strike mark.

771
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,510
For 2.

772
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,070
I have 2.

773
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:16,310
So...

774
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,770
It's all lethal?

775
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,210
No.

776
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,170
So...

777
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,410
No, nothing else.

778
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,050
Will do.

779
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,750
Alright, 3 other lucky folks.

780
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:38,990
Who wish to...

781
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:41,230
Get through cocoon together.

782
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:43,850
Now is the time.

783
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,160
If we have to cause...

784
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,100
Ready?

785
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,240
Go!

786
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,780
Ready!

787
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,840
For broken buckets and for...

788
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,120
Sorry.

789
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,100
Welcome!

790
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,000
Alright, let's prep.

791
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,840
Prep up everybody.

792
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:10,700
Prep up.

793
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,840
Ouch!

794
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,360
No!

795
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,960
Going with the tea.

796
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,980
It's a Metal Gear staple to go with the tea.

797
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,600
Going with the tea.

798
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,560
We don't need the smoke grenade but we'll...

799
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,900
Is the chaff good for this one?

800
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,600
Gotta bring my empty mags.

801
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,480
The strike mark.

802
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,220
Tada!

803
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,000
And we'll bring the supply marker, that's important.

804
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,620
As long as we don't hear...

805
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,680
I love the beach!

806
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,440
I love the beach!

807
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,220
I love that one, please!

808
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,040
Please!

809
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,940
I love the beach.

810
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,200
Nobody?

811
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,820
No one's gonna say I love the beach?

812
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:09,920
That's fine.

813
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,640
Chaff should be good.

814
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,380
Maybe instead of grenade we...

815
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,400
No,

816
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,280
I think this is OK.

817
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,140
Super M.

818
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,800
This should be good.

819
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,360
Alright, everybody!

820
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:41,780
Everybody!

821
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,600
Everybody, ready, ready, ready, Freddy!

822
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,120
Looks like two are ready.

823
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,800
Three are ready!

824
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,860
Let's go!

825
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:00,540
I love the beach.

826
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:02,940
Going with the tea.

827
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,180
Is that a Death Stranding reference?

828
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:06,900
The beach.

829
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,840
Are you guys having a good weekend so far?

830
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,460
Did you guys get to sleep in?

831
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,340
I had a meeting with my new tax person today.

832
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:24,040
Except it ended just a little bit before stream because she slept in.

833
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,660
But she's so nice.

834
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,300
Oh my gosh, I love my new tax person.

835
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,060
I have to work on Saturdays.

836
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,660
Oh no!

837
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,380
Good luck with work.

838
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,080
I have to wake up at 5AM.

839
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,100
Am I going to marry her?

840
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:43,740
I don't know.

841
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,040
I don't know if she's taking me on.

842
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,140
OP!

843
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,600
Pink pants!

844
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,440
Hey, who didn't get the memo here?

845
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,300
Someone is overdressed for the occasion.

846
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,220
Glad you got a good tax person.

847
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,800
My friend recommended her.

848
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,620
She's so nice.

849
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,660
Hey, you!

850
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,860
Hey, broken!

851
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:13,820
Alright!

852
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,080
It's so loud.

853
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,080
Get up, Snake.

854
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,540
Am I already... Oh my gosh, I'm already almost dead.

855
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,700
Ouchie ouch!

856
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,360
Hold on.

857
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,300
Rude.

858
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,000
No, no, no!

859
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,380
Run, Snake, run!

860
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,640
You guys got this.

861
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,920
You guys got this and... I don't know why.

862
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,660
This thing is so stinking slow.

863
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,580
I don't really need to...

864
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,580
Attack the pod!

865
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,760
Attack the pod!

866
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,380
Attack the pod!

867
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,160
Attack the pod!

868
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,400
I'll just go for some other stuff too.

869
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,440
Like that.

870
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,020
What happened to me?

871
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,320
What's happening?

872
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,650
Just then.

873
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:33,650
Hello?

874
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,410
Let's go downstairs.

875
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:40,750
Oh my god, the chainsaw!

876
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,130
Rude!

877
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:51,870
Get some of these other stinking, stinky guys out of the way.

878
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,270
If I can.

879
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:55,690
What is this?

880
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,770
What is the green gas?

881
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,310
I shouldn't have gone in.

882
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,350
Are we okay?

883
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,620
Hug the walls!

884
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,600
Hug the walls!

885
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,320
Oh my gosh, I thought that was about to kill me.

886
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,260
Yeah!

887
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,020
We got the ladder!

888
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,180
Good job, guys.

889
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,660
Nice.

890
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,640
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

891
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:35,630
That was close.

892
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:37,470
That was close.

893
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:38,830
No!

894
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,890
I should have... I should have... I'm such an idiot.

895
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:47,990
We'll do it just in case now.

896
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,210
Take out the weapon!

897
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:51,450
I'll get it!

898
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:51,870
I'll get it!

899
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,040
Gusto!

900
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,600
Oh

901
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,800
my gosh, Broken, are you okay up there?

902
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,140
Did I hit you?

903
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:19,900
I hope not.

904
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,700
Use the ladder.

905
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,540
Go underneath it.

906
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,600
I know what happens, but I'll go under.

907
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,120
Will it do it here?

908
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,060
Oh no!

909
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,060
Someone left some stuff over here.

910
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,500
Hello, you left your goods.

911
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,560
You left your goodies.

912
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,500
Wait, why did I just throw that?

913
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,420
I picked the wrong thing.

914
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,440
Hey, wait!

915
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,620
No way, this should have been me!

916
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:28,740
No!

917
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,660
You're the only one who I trust for the occasion!

918
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,020
No!

919
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,990
Oh, I didn't get on top in time.

920
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,960
My best moment!

921
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,770
I need more stuff.

922
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:06,810
I

923
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:11,380
have team.

924
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,360
Oh, my stuff is literally dropping to the ground.

925
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,000
Please, please hold on.

926
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,140
I gotta run it.

927
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,260
I gotta run and catch it.

928
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,150
Actually, maybe I don't want the Fem.

929
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,850
Actually, I'm okay with the Fem.

930
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,000
We'll do Gusto instead.

931
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,080
Get lots of stuff in there, Broken!

932
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,960
I'll destroy some other things.

933
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,280
Wow, we're at it.

934
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,160
Main cannon!

935
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:50,920
Let's go!

936
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,400
Let's get some...

937
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,980
Wait, what just happened?

938
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:00,600
Is that it?

939
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,680
It was so fast!

940
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,540
It was so fast!

941
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,980
Oops, I guess I died.

942
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,800
Oops, I guess I died.

943
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,700
It was so strong.

944
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,640
It was so fast!

945
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,320
Did I get everything in there?

946
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,800
Watch out!

947
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,000
I like how the Mammal Pod just has it's own like...

948
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,100
It's own like...instincts.

949
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,900
Okay team.

950
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,140
Alright, I'm still the leader of this team.

951
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:44,600
No!

952
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,520
I've been reduced to second!

953
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:48,940
No!

954
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,400
You're supposed to follow my lead!

955
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,120
No!

956
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,310
Why always this submission is so good?

957
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:20,630
Walk.

958
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:21,530
Power.

959
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,330
He's the captain now.

960
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:28,870
Oh

961
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,980
wait, I meant to go to the mission.

962
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:38,780
It's fine though.

963
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,100
Déjà vu!

964
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,160
Power Zeke.

965
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,820
A new plant has been built thanks to staff efforts.

966
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,040
Delivery!

967
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:51,900
Really?

968
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,240
What girl?

969
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,900
Thank you, the flower.

970
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:08,110
Thanks mom, it's always a pleasure to match T-shirts with you.

971
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,750
Thanks alrighty!

972
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:11,650
Oh my gosh, wait!

973
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:16,610
I just realized you guys, today I'm wearing...

974
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:20,810
You can't tell it's underneath my maid uniform, but I'm wearing a Peace Walker T-shirt!

975
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,550
I'm wearing my white T-shirt!

976
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:26,950
I matched with Snake even!

977
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,440
I'm matching with Snake!

978
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,980
Thank you for the gift!

979
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,780
Wait, skip.

980
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:49,960
There we go.

981
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:50,780
And righty!

982
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,820
Thanks for the gift!

983
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,140
Thank you for the gifts!

984
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,740
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

985
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:07,740
Curry.

986
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,620
Yummy snacks.

987
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,040
Thank you, thank you!

988
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,080
Nice, nice, nice.

989
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,160
Alrighty.

990
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,540
We're not done yet.

991
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,100
We're not done yet.

992
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,800
No ambulance box.

993
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:27,520
I have one.

994
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,400
Infiltrate the underground base.

995
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,800
Make your way to the bottom of the underground base and stop Peace Walker before it is complete.

996
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,300
Wait, is this the scene?

997
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,160
No.

998
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,080
I'm thinking of the Vic boss scene.

999
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,640
Is it this one?

1000
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,400
Find Strange 11!

1001
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,460
Go out with her!

1002
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:55,900
That's later?

1003
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:56,200
OK.

1004
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,680
At the very bottom of the mine.

1005
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,660
Infiltrate the base and put a stop to the project by destroying Peace Walker's AI pod.

1006
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,080
OK!

1007
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,280
Who would like to join me to destroy Peace Walker's AI pod?

1008
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,780
Haven't survived close?

1009
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:16,640
Maybe.

1010
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,300
Oh, my favors!

1011
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,080
Welcome back!

1012
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:27,500
I guess I'll get out of my T-shirt even though it's very comfortable.

1013
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:29,760
Stealth.

1014
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:39,220
And we'll bring this guy again.

1015
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,420
And Mark 22.

1016
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,020
Stealth.

1017
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,020
So much good teamwork in this stream.

1018
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:45,460
Right?

1019
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:48,400
Everybody's working so well together.

1020
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,700
Happy, happy.

1021
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,680
Alright.

1022
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:52,840
We ready?

1023
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,700
We ready, ready, ready, ready?

1024
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,440
Hi, everyone.

1025
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:01,940
Hello!

1026
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,620
Ready to...

1027
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,180
I'm gonna eat a cough drop.

1028
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,440
I've been having them everyday.

1029
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,280
I'm gonna have one now.

1030
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,260
I hope you guys don't mind.

1031
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:38,650
My throat hurts a little bit.

1032
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:41,750
Which is unusual actually.

1033
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:42,850
It doesn't usually hurt.

1034
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,450
No, sneak in.

1035
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:51,590
No, sneak out.

1036
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,150
Sneak in only.

1037
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:01,810
I actually don't remember this.

1038
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:03,870
Even a little bit.

1039
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:08,950
I actually don't remember this part even a tiny bit.

1040
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:14,570
I think I... Did I just like forget this part ever existed?

1041
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:19,810
Oops.

1042
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:21,830
Why'd you have to run?

1043
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,030
Nice, nice.

1044
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:32,870
You're too fast!

1045
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:34,270
Let me get one, please!

1046
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:35,630
I want a man!

1047
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:36,530
Stop!

1048
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,790
I want one for myself.

1049
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:42,850
Ok, I got him.

1050
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,850
That guy is mine.

1051
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:53,130
Don't steal my snack.

1052
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,870
Where did I hear somebody at?

1053
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,430
I don't remember this part at all.

1054
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:06,350
Look!

1055
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:08,750
I'm on top of the Metal Gear!

1056
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,550
I'm on top!

1057
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:11,370
Look at me!

1058
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,540
Yeah, me too.

1059
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:27,320
I know that the stealth suit makes it so that they can't hear your footsteps, but it still makes me...

1060
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,400
Wait, where do we need to go?

1061
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,620
It still makes me paranoid.

1062
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,160
Because I can hear it, you know what I mean?

1063
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:36,720
Is it here?

1064
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,580
Where are we going?

1065
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,700
I'm following you.

1066
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:50,200
Should we take some of these guys?

1067
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:52,760
Ok!

1068
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,620
We're taking them home!

1069
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,760
Welcome back!

1070
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,900
Oh you have the special one.

1071
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Nice.

1072
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,280
Ready?

1073
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,220
Let's go!

1074
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,320
I want that Fulton.

1075
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,140
The one that drops their stuff too.

1076
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,160
Let's go baby.

1077
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,720
Why don't I remember this area at all?

1078
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,100
I don't know.

1079
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,080
Oh wait!

1080
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,880
Now it's kinda coming back to me.

1081
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,760
It's funny though that they don't have anything on them, you know?

1082
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,920
You're a lady.

1083
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,040
Let's go.

1084
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:56,700
Oh!

1085
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:01,040
Sorry, I got a little contact.

1086
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,840
I got a little bit of a...wow.

1087
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:13,900
Oh shoot.

1088
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:14,860
No, no!

1089
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:15,880
Good job.

1090
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,460
I'll take you home too.

1091
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,460
Oh shoot, that guy is running.

1092
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:30,380
He's scaring me.

1093
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:31,900
You got him?

1094
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,860
Oh, I'm not gonna get you.

1095
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,080
Nice hit!

1096
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,240
Nice!

1097
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,320
I'll do a flip to that.

1098
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:43,900
Prisoner.

1099
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,460
You got him?

1100
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,460
They're coming!

1101
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:50,780
They're coming!

1102
01:07:58,820 --> 01:07:59,840
Thank you!

1103
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,120
I'll take him home.

1104
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,480
You got him?

1105
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,380
Good job.

1106
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,340
Good job team.

1107
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,060
Oh you're taking this guy.

1108
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,500
We're gonna extract him too.

1109
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:12,500
Him?

1110
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,280
OK, I got him.

1111
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,520
Oh wait, I pressed it.

1112
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:16,900
What happened?

1113
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:18,920
That was weird.

1114
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,560
Sorry, I didn't mean for you to waste one.

1115
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:26,820
Let's go!

1116
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,400
Obligatory teabagging?

1117
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,020
No!

1118
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,560
No!

1119
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,920
We have quite a collection of men.

1120
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:53,140
Hey mister.

1121
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,200
Hey, why did you move?

1122
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,580
I lost him.

1123
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:10,940
He's so blind!

1124
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,720
He's so blind!

1125
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:12,680
He's so blind!

1126
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,800
He's so blind!

1127
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,120
Stupid man!

1128
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:18,580
Stupid!

1129
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,560
I don't think we want to extract him.

1130
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,500
That guy is not gonna be of any use to us.

1131
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,140
That guy is blind as a bat.

1132
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:35,130
Hey!

1133
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:37,170
What did you just...

1134
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:49,030
Where's the other guy at?

1135
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:50,950
Oh he's all the way down there.

1136
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:51,670
Oh he's got a shield.

1137
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,130
And his buddy does too.

1138
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:55,210
How are they so blind?

1139
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,240
I got him.

1140
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,280
I'm getting praised you guys!

1141
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,860
Happy day!

1142
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:15,760
Happy day!

1143
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,160
You want me to get him?

1144
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,500
Don't kill him.

1145
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,780
Wait, I kind of want to have a go at him.

1146
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,120
No!

1147
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,200
How could you?

1148
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:40,960
Can I look at your boobs real quick?

1149
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,440
Turn around?

1150
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,520
Nice!

1151
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,560
Oh sorry.

1152
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:54,700
Let's go.

1153
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,430
Wait, where is it?

1154
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:01,710
This way?

1155
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:04,930
Oh!

1156
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:06,970
Down here.

1157
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:09,730
Come on!

1158
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:10,370
Come on!

1159
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:16,130
I didn't want to auto him!

1160
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:17,770
I'm pushing!

1161
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:25,000
Wayfarer...

1162
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,260
Wayfarer...

1163
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,400
Wayfarer...

1164
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,200
Wayfarer...

1165
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,900
Ok, I'm done pouting now.

1166
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:41,920
Is this...

1167
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,920
Is this testing for me for later?

1168
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,360
For maybe a potential...

1169
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,920
You know, first butts and now boobies.

1170
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:57,340
Yippee!

1171
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,640
It's a great day!

1172
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,180
What was I going to say?

1173
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,580
A little foreshadow.

1174
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:16,940
Strange love!

1175
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,500
Look how beautiful she is.

1176
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,600
Strange love.

1177
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,020
QTE coming.

1178
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,040
Thank you for the warning.

1179
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,200
I totally...

1180
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,560
How did they get up there so fast?

1181
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,840
Jack, you've returned.

1182
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,240
What's wrong?

1183
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,340
Your body temperature has fallen.

1184
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,120
You're imagining things.

1185
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:58,520
Have you come to destroy me?

1186
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,100
Your pulse has quickened slightly.

1187
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,340
Just chilly.

1188
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,680
It's freezing in here.

1189
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,460
I see.

1190
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:09,680
Boss.

1191
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:12,020
What is it, Jack?

1192
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:15,600
Boss, is that you?

1193
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,660
What is it, Jack?

1194
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,740
Do you have regrets?

1195
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,340
Regrets?

1196
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:25,760
About your final mission.

1197
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,380
My final mission?

1198
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,120
The one in Krasnograd.

1199
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,140
I've never been on a mission there.

1200
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,440
September 1964.

1201
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,560
You betrayed the United States.

1202
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,710
And then...

1203
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:46,000
I killed you.

1204
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,320
I have no record of such a debriefing.

1205
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:51,700
Listen to me.

1206
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,180
I have to know.

1207
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,840
Did you defect to the Soviet Union of your own free will?

1208
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,100
There is no mission record matching that description.

1209
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:03,520
Jack.

1210
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,880
You're not the boss.

1211
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,100
The boss is dead.

1212
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,040
Don't do it, Jack.

1213
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,280
Drop your weapon, Big Boss.

1214
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:17,000
Mammals showed the same response back at the lab.

1215
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,220
It's a sure sign that you are nearby.

1216
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,500
Excuse me.

1217
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:24,360
It's an honor to meet you again, Big Boss.

1218
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,300
I've seen that coyote before.

1219
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,300
That's a coyote?

1220
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,040
Lobo is the name.

1221
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,820
Lobo?

1222
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,900
It smells like a rotting corpse to me.

1223
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:38,080
I know all about you.

1224
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,420
Selina Yarsk.

1225
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,740
Ten years ago.

1226
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,860
You were involved.

1227
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:46,100
The operation to eliminate the traitor.

1228
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,200
I planned the whole thing.

1229
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,420
Shouldn't a suit like you be back in Langley?

1230
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,940
What the hell are you doing here?

1231
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,560
It's what the CIA does best.

1232
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,080
Ensure people in the know keep their mouths shut.

1233
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,060
Or else pack them off someplace where there's no one to listen.

1234
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,740
How come that looks like such a weenie and how is he so strong?

1235
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,980
It's not quite that simple.

1236
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:11,240
My aim is a new world order.

1237
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,740
Detente, the NPT.

1238
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,940
Salt, TTBT.

1239
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:23,920
Ever since the Cuban Missile Crisis, the structure of the Cold War has been coming apart at the seams.

1240
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,380
A new age is dawning.

1241
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:37,120
An age in which Peace Walker, an infallible nuclear deterrent system with the patience and cold logic of a machine, will play a vital role.

1242
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,060
That's your plan.

1243
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,820
Assigning humanity's sins to a bunch of machines?

1244
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,540
Quite the romantic.

1245
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,440
Remember the Cuban Missile Crisis?

1246
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:55,100
When the commander of a Russian sub refused an order to launch a nuclear-armed torpedo at an American destroyer?

1247
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,560
Oh history.

1248
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:59,360
In retrospect, that man was a hero.

1249
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:02,780
He saved the world from all out nuclear war.

1250
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:07,480
Humans are incapable of destroying themselves.

1251
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,120
But an AI wouldn't hesitate to push the button.

1252
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:11,820
Precisely.

1253
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,560
Making it the one real deterrent.

1254
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,760
People hesitate, lose their nerve.

1255
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,560
Isn't that why deterrence theory works in the first place?

1256
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:20,340
No.

1257
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,060
Machines don't make mistakes.

1258
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:32,880
That's why I love when Google AI tells me to put cement on my salad as a dressing.

1259
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:42,120
Once our system is embraced, Langley will again turn its attention to Latin America as the cockpit of a new Cold War.

1260
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:46,060
Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama...

1261
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,680
Peace Walker will be deployed along Central America's entire Caribbean coast.

1262
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:56,960
All of North America, South America, and the West Indies will be within its range.

1263
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:00,280
We'll bring law and order to the entire continent.

1264
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,460
And you'll still be calling the shots?

1265
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,680
You still don't get it.

1266
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,420
The age of heroes is over.

1267
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,480
Bury it alongside the boss and her bankrupt beliefs.

1268
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,620
From now on, our only heroes will be machines.

1269
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:20,640
Surely no one understands that better than you.

1270
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,360
Except perhaps your partner.

1271
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,680
A deterrent for hire.

1272
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,860
An army without borders.

1273
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,140
You've invented a new system too?

1274
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,600
And an admirable one at that.

1275
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,380
It is admirable.

1276
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,520
That's supposed to be an offer.

1277
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:36,540
I'm not offering anything.

1278
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:44,520
If I'm to sell my new system, you and yours have got to go.

1279
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,220
Wait!

1280
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:48,840
Coldman, I have questions for him.

1281
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,780
Information critical to the completion of the mammal pod.

1282
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:55,020
Give him to me.

1283
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,560
Don't waste too much time.

1284
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:03,480
We've just received word that the SALT II talks are on schedule.

1285
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,240
We will launch on time.

1286
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:11,420
Snake, you are going to help me resurrect her.

1287
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:12,300
Shut up!

1288
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,680
The boss is dead.

1289
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:14,900
Bring him.

1290
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,140
I got him.

1291
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:20,680
RT!

1292
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:22,320
Over!

1293
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,600
RT!

1294
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:24,920
Over!

1295
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:26,680
Why?

1296
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,880
Oh shit I've got it wrong.

1297
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:28,340
Oh no!

1298
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,440
No!

1299
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,260
I pressed RT instead of Y.

1300
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,800
Nice punch.

1301
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,720
It's OK.

1302
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:45,500
Game over!

1303
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:50,100
Game over!

1304
01:18:53,740 --> 01:19:00,720
Someone sent a super chat earlier about how they don't like that in MGS3 it's very clear what the boss' intentions were.

1305
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,220
But in this game, it's like they say that she defected or this and that.

1306
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,620
And I think it's...

1307
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,620
I think it's...

1308
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:16,220
I think maybe this is why people complain about Peace Walker.

1309
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,360
It's not my favorite aspect of it.

1310
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,800
But it's...

1311
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,600
Yeah, it's really Snake's...

1312
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,600
Snake kind of gets into his own head about it.

1313
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:30,640
I think he's just so overcome with guilt that...

1314
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,200
You know, even Strangelove...

1315
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,920
Strangelove tries to convince him like...

1316
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,800
Hey man, you remember what happened?

1317
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,460
You were there.

1318
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,720
And he's just like...

1319
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,780
No, she defected.

1320
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:40,180
And she's like...

1321
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,500
No, that's not the real story.

1322
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,540
They fed you lies.

1323
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,140
But also at the same time, I feel kind of conflicted about it because I'm like...

1324
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,040
Why would you believe...

1325
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,580
Like you left the US because you were so upset about it.

1326
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,220
Why are you believing them?

1327
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,760
But at the same time, they kind of just need him to become like a villain.

1328
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:02,540
They kind of need him to become like his little villain arc so that they can have...

1329
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,260
You know...

1330
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,460
Outer Heaven happen and all that stuff.

1331
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,760
How do you interpret the boss' will?

1332
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:14,540
Hmm...

1333
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,720
Lady was cool.

1334
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,300
Everybody always is just misinterpreting the boss.

1335
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:23,260
Pretty much.

1336
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,240
Wow, we got 14 guys!

1337
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:33,300
But yeah, it's kind of confusing because you see how the end of...

1338
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,540
How his reaction is at the end of...

1339
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:36,700
End of 3.

1340
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,800
But then you see him in this game and he's become like this little...

1341
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,500
Pathetic baby who's just like...

1342
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:42,500
No!

1343
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:43,960
The boss...

1344
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,300
The boss defected.

1345
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:46,580
Why'd you do that?

1346
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,300
But you know...

1347
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,920
I want to slap a slice of cheese on the bald guy's chrome dome.

1348
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,360
Yeah...

1349
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,380
He was always a baby.

1350
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,540
It's so true.

1351
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:01,680
He was always a baby.

1352
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,560
He's my little guy.

1353
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:06,480
He's my little guy.

1354
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:10,480
But also, it's been a long time since 3, so...

1355
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:12,960
He probably...

1356
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,100
Oh, thanks for the delivery!

1357
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,700
He probably also is just like...

1358
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,960
So in his head at this point.

1359
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:21,900
Thanks, Wayfarers!

1360
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:22,800
Go, go, go!

1361
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,700
Thank you!

1362
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:29,480
Thank you!

1363
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:32,780
Go,

1364
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:36,880
go, go!

1365
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,000
Thank you so much for the gifts!

1366
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,600
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1367
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,420
Alright, let's sort our guys again.

1368
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,220
Who do we have here?

1369
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:56,540
Warthog.

1370
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,980
When I was a young warthog.

1371
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:01,360
Polar bear.

1372
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,060
I have a guy.

1373
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,500
I don't know if it was on stream or if I...

1374
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,440
I'm former sass.

1375
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,760
But...

1376
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,020
Wow, Flamingo's cracked at cooking.

1377
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,680
But he had literally nothing written on his thing.

1378
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,160
The low rank 2!

1379
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:24,940
Let's grab that.

1380
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,440
Nice.

1381
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,680
Nice, nice, nice.

1382
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,040
Um...

1383
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,020
You know what?

1384
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,140
I'll just get these guys.

1385
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:45,540
Why not?

1386
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,420
What other items do we have?

1387
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:53,260
Curry!

1388
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:55,700
Mate!

1389
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,660
Lovebox 3!

1390
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:02,040
Important.

1391
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:03,660
You know what?

1392
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:04,800
I'll even get the Walkman.

1393
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:07,920
Let's just get everything at this...

1394
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,200
You know what?

1395
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:09,540
Let's just get all the items.

1396
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,160
Yay!

1397
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:12,860
OK.

1398
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:16,240
Nice.

1399
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,300
Curry.

1400
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:21,900
Curry, curry, curry.

1401
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,640
Torture chamber escape.

1402
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,420
I need to lay down for a while.

1403
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:42,940
My memory...

1404
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:44,400
Wait, I can do this.

1405
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,660
Not just by myself.

1406
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:47,960
That's kind of funny.

1407
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:51,180
Welcome back!

1408
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,080
We have no mission prep.

1409
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,620
We're all by ourselves.

1410
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:57,880
So sad.

1411
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:00,700
Let's go then.

1412
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,320
We got nothing to lose.

1413
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,660
He's a pro at escaping prison.

1414
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,560
O.S.P.

1415
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,640
My thumbs are in danger.

1416
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:15,080
I know!

1417
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:15,860
Oh gosh!

1418
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,180
OK.

1419
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,800
Micmac, you've played this one.

1420
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,200
You've played this game, so you know.

1421
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,960
I think this one is hard.

1422
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,660
Torture is more difficult than MGS1.

1423
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,600
That's just my opinion.

1424
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,300
I think.

1425
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:36,660
I feel like it was.

1426
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,640
I don't remember though.

1427
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:40,880
We'll see.

1428
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:43,240
Maybe I've improved.

1429
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:48,820
I think the MGS1 one is so easy.

1430
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,620
I had my lady swimsuit and they didn't let me equip it.

1431
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:51,920
No!

1432
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,420
OK, join for another one.

1433
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:55,660
No.

1434
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:00,690
A BGM.

1435
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:15,350
Loyalty to your country or loyalty to me.

1436
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:18,050
Your country or your old mentor.

1437
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,570
Your mission or your beliefs.

1438
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:24,290
Your duty to your unit or your personal feelings.

1439
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:30,010
The only thing we can believe in with absolute certainty is the mission, Jack.

1440
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,250
Rise and shine.

1441
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:38,790
Rise and shine.

1442
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:41,190
Coldman's greed does not concern me.

1443
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:44,210
I'm only interested in one thing.

1444
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:46,330
The truth.

1445
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:49,890
I'm a scientist, an AI developer.

1446
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:52,690
But not an AI myself.

1447
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:58,050
I'm a scientist, and as a scientist I find this distasteful.

1448
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:00,250
You understand?

1449
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:05,890
I am a scientist, and I expect answers that make sense.

1450
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:10,190
Now, what do you know?

1451
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:15,750
Your boss defected from the US taking a Davy Crock with her.

1452
01:26:16,090 --> 01:26:19,290
And used it to launch a nuclear strike on Soviet territory.

1453
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:22,770
That much I know from the CIA's official debriefing.

1454
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:26,670
Did she defect or not?

1455
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:28,810
Answer me!

1456
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,510
Did she or did she not die for her country?

1457
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,490
That's why there's no info about that mission because she doesn't know.

1458
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:36,710
She doesn't want to put in the wrong information.

1459
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:38,610
She sold us out.

1460
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:41,230
My orders were to take care of her.

1461
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:42,910
Liar!

1462
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,950
I want to know the truth!

1463
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:47,850
Brace yourself.

1464
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:49,610
Okay, what do I press?

1465
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:02,710
Oh god, it's so long.

1466
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:04,810
You hate me?

1467
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:05,890
Fine.

1468
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:07,390
Turn it up.

1469
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:11,530
It doesn't change the fact that I killed her.

1470
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:12,670
I know that.

1471
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:15,250
But what I don't know is your motive.

1472
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:20,810
Why would a hero, loyal to the end, betray her country?

1473
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,750
What really happened?

1474
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:25,150
What did you see?

1475
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:27,710
She betrayed more than just her country.

1476
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,410
She betrayed me too.

1477
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:33,150
Then how do you explain that bandana?

1478
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:35,630
Why keep a memento of a traitor?

1479
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:37,530
What are you talking about?

1480
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:39,370
And what about that scar?

1481
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:43,910
Don't tell me you have the same scars by sheer coincidence.

1482
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:46,010
Don't touch me!

1483
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:50,370
Decorating your body with her memory.

1484
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:53,470
Rather effeminate, if you ask me.

1485
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:56,970
Answer me!

1486
01:27:59,410 --> 01:27:59,790
No!

1487
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:18,730
It's so long.

1488
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,730
Ouchie.

1489
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:44,190
Why won't you tell me?

1490
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:47,590
You're no longer one of Washington's lapdogs.

1491
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:50,670
You have no moral obligation to your country.

1492
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:52,850
Answer me!

1493
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:56,710
Would you see your beloved boss brought back to life?

1494
01:28:57,810 --> 01:28:58,950
Then say it.

1495
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:01,030
Say she died for America.

1496
01:29:01,810 --> 01:29:04,570
That she remained true to the end.

1497
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:08,670
Gave her life for the country that betrayed her time and again.

1498
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:09,390
No.

1499
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:13,650
What if he admits that?

1500
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:18,330
Then he has to admit that he killed her for... for nothing.

1501
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:21,890
She went to her grave, cursing her country.

1502
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:22,370
No!

1503
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,290
Snake!

1504
01:29:23,470 --> 01:29:23,850
Why?

1505
01:29:24,370 --> 01:29:25,370
Who is it?

1506
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,010
What are you protecting?

1507
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:29,410
I'm not helping you finish that thing.

1508
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:32,470
Face it.

1509
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:35,050
The boss is dead.

1510
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:38,550
Whatever's inside that machine, it isn't her.

1511
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:41,970
I think Snake has just started to like this kind of thing.

1512
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:45,430
The next one, I kill you!

1513
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:45,690
No!

1514
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:57,140
Something's going on outside.

1515
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,080
That one wasn't so long.

1516
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,140
Abort the mission.

1517
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:04,420
We have a man down.

1518
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:11,010
Are you kidding me?

1519
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,450
Are you kidding me?

1520
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:23,190
Micmac?

1521
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:26,590
Micmac?

1522
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:26,670
Micmac?

1523
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,360
Real sorry boss?

1524
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,060
Wait, can I skip this?

1525
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,020
Don't die on me Micmac!

1526
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:00,720
Come on!

1527
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:02,640
Skipping!

1528
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:03,760
Skipping!

1529
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,980
I've never seen that cutscene though.

1530
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,840
I've never seen that cutscene.

1531
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:40,960
It hurts!

1532
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:41,360
It hurts!

1533
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:41,760
It hurts!

1534
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:42,140
It hurts!

1535
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:42,940
It hurts!

1536
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,080
Oh my god.

1537
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,700
I started pressing B instead of Y.

1538
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,000
He's passed out.

1539
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,200
Ok, back on track.

1540
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:14,200
I trusted you.

1541
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:20,860
I had to do this twice.

1542
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:26,100
Wow, this looks like poops all of a sudden.

1543
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:28,960
Hello poops.

1544
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,780
It's like poops, no?

1545
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:50,070
Actually I don't remember how to...let's see what we have.

1546
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:51,610
Sunrod.

1547
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,040
Where are you Micmac?

1548
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:13,150
That's horrible.

1549
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:21,650
I can't fault him yet though.

1550
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:40,370
Wait, I'm just chilling here.

1551
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:42,230
Wait, hold on.

1552
01:33:43,810 --> 01:33:45,550
I've got to wait for this guy.

1553
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:48,290
He's not going to notice, right?

1554
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,010
Hello.

1555
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:50,310
Stop.

1556
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:50,770
Go away.

1557
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:53,090
Hello.

1558
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:54,610
Can you leave?

1559
01:33:56,670 --> 01:34:00,290
Why does he look so like...he's like...

1560
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:02,650
Nothing to see here.

1561
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:12,650
My bad.

1562
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:13,050
Sorry.

1563
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:15,270
Sorry.

1564
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:18,110
Sorry!

1565
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:18,430
Sorry!

1566
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:23,050
Wait, we don't have to go through...

1567
01:34:24,490 --> 01:34:25,490
It again, right?

1568
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:33,030
Please God, no.

1569
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:35,590
Not the torture sequence again.

1570
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:39,050
Even Steven!

1571
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:45,100
Ok, we're fine.

1572
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:45,460
We're fine.

1573
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:45,820
We're fine.

1574
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,740
Everything is good.

1575
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,320
Everything is good.

1576
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:51,820
My hand...I'm just, you know, I'm in such...

1577
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:54,860
I'm in such bad state because, you know...

1578
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,860
Because, you know...

1579
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:04,580
I just was...I had to do the torture sequence.

1580
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:08,720
Just, you know, it like really hurt my hand so bad.

1581
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,740
Oh good, now he goes another way.

1582
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,310
There's so many guys here.

1583
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:43,830
I'm out!

1584
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:44,390
I'm free!

1585
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,100
I'll come back for you maybe.

1586
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:53,300
Wait, how do I leave?

1587
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:54,200
How do I get out of this?

1588
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,940
You hear

1589
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:07,020
that?

1590
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,220
What's going on?

1591
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:09,720
Oh my God.

1592
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:11,700
You hear that at the distance?

1593
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,160
It's so funny.

1594
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,080
Hold on, this is my guy.

1595
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:18,060
I'm gonna get him.

1596
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:18,960
I'm waiting.

1597
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:22,740
I'm waiting for him to leave.

1598
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:40,020
I got his butt.

1599
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:41,600
Where are you Mick Mack?

1600
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:43,160
Oh, that's not you.

1601
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:43,980
That's not...

1602
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:45,640
Bring who in?

1603
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:48,560
Oh...

1604
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:04,810
Talk.

1605
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:10,910
He doesn't know anything.

1606
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:12,450
Useless!

1607
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:17,750
There's still a guy over here.

1608
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:18,470
We got to get him though.

1609
01:37:18,670 --> 01:37:18,870
Maybe.

1610
01:37:24,090 --> 01:37:26,510
And there's also a prisoner next to me.

1611
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:38,960
There's two guys here.

1612
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:40,180
OK, you take down one.

1613
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:40,780
I got the other.

1614
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,620
He's gonna come over here.

1615
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:49,320
You got him?

1616
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:50,820
Nice.

1617
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:52,900
Yeah.

1618
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:54,100
Oh my God!

1619
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,380
Mine will be just as violent.

1620
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,560
You didn't know anything?

1621
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,220
He said I'm pretty good.

1622
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:16,180
OK, I want him.

1623
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:16,780
He's a keeper.

1624
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,680
Where do we get our stuff Mick Mack?

1625
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:25,400
Don't do that to him.

1626
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:29,440
Get up.

1627
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:30,580
Come on.

1628
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:31,900
Where do we go?

1629
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:36,640
This way.

1630
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:39,320
Down here.

1631
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,460
Wait, but the prisoner...

1632
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:45,820
Oh, I'm running into the wall.

1633
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,000
Over this way?

1634
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:47,400
Yeah.

1635
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,080
Wait, this way.

1636
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:53,000
Come on.

1637
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:53,840
Let's go.

1638
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,260
Keeping him warm.

1639
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:06,340
Hot cold man.

1640
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,860
He is such a weenie.

1641
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,750
We got the A.S.S.

1642
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:18,470
music!

1643
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:24,430
Let's go A.S.S.

1644
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:38,650
When is the next time gonna be anyway?

1645
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:41,710
There is such a pat.

1646
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:42,710
Are you OK Snake?

1647
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:44,270
Snake?

1648
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:48,470
Don't make me laugh.

1649
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:52,930
No smoking for you for a while, huh?

1650
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:54,850
I'll be fine.

1651
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:57,190
The pain in my chest is gone.

1652
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:59,910
So that was just a copy of the boss's wound.

1653
01:40:00,490 --> 01:40:01,050
That's right.

1654
01:40:01,610 --> 01:40:02,770
The scar is gone now.

1655
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:06,050
Nice work.

1656
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:12,410
My baby!

1657
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:15,070
My baby girl!

1658
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:22,210
Why are those in quotes?

1659
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:38,930
Skipping school.

1660
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:39,370
Pause!

1661
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:42,030
You're great!

1662
01:40:44,650 --> 01:40:44,970
No!

1663
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:57,690
Jesus!

1664
01:40:57,950 --> 01:40:58,150
Please!

1665
01:40:58,150 --> 01:40:58,610
Come on!

1666
01:41:01,710 --> 01:41:03,850
Don't skip school!

1667
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:19,930
Chaos It's like it's waiting for us.

1668
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,850
It's like it's waiting for us or something.

1669
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:26,310
Ah!

1670
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:27,110
Yay!

1671
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:31,670
I'm just gonna hit you with the yo-yo.

1672
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:37,850
OK, we made some new things.

1673
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:41,690
Oh a delivery for me?

1674
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:46,030
Whatever could it be?

1675
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,190
Happy birthday!

1676
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:51,410
Nice.

1677
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:09,280
What did you give me?

1678
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,500
Stealth mat.

1679
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,140
No!

1680
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,540
Away from me!

1681
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:16,900
Big Mac!

1682
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,840
Men's cologne!

1683
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:22,340
Future curry!

1684
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:25,100
Oh we got those!

1685
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,340
Oh my gosh!

1686
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,300
You sent me some really fancy things.

1687
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:29,360
Thank you!

1688
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:32,880
Thank you, thank you.

1689
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:33,580
Future!

1690
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:36,260
Future, future, future!

1691
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:43,110
Is it this mission?

1692
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:48,780
Is this the one?

1693
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:51,680
Or is it... Soon.

1694
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,060
I know it's very soon.

1695
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,980
Speaking of pause, how was Pause the Cat?

1696
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:56,740
She was so needy.

1697
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:01,100
She was so needy right before stream.

1698
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,520
I barely wanted to leave her.

1699
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:10,880
I know, she just kept wanting to... She would like meow at me.

1700
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:17,240
And then like run... She runs to like a certain room and then she like plops on the floor and wants to be pet.

1701
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:19,780
She's so funny.

1702
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,380
Let her in?

1703
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:25,660
If I let her in, she'll want to out immediately though.

1704
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,240
Yeah, she was cute.

1705
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:29,780
OK.

1706
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,380
I don't think it's this one.

1707
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:42,580
OK.

1708
01:43:43,860 --> 01:43:45,020
Who wants to join?

1709
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:54,350
Mobius!

1710
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:55,830
Welcome, welcome.

1711
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:59,250
How do we get our stuff back?

1712
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:00,130
I wonder.

1713
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:03,090
Maybe we should have walked around and find a...

1714
01:44:03,090 --> 01:44:05,050
Fulton in that one area maybe.

1715
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:07,650
Guess who's back.

1716
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:09,630
Welcome back.

1717
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:13,250
I probably don't need you.

1718
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:16,930
We'll bring...

1719
01:44:20,610 --> 01:44:22,390
Just in case.

1720
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:26,690
Are we ready?

1721
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:29,910
Looks like we're ready.

1722
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:30,990
Let's go!

1723
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:35,150
Starting mission.

1724
01:44:38,350 --> 01:44:42,430
For the one mission, I don't know if you guys know what I'm referring to.

1725
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:44,390
There's a mission with a song.

1726
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:50,270
For that one.

1727
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:53,090
Getting stuff back is an extra ops mission.

1728
01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:56,750
Thanks for the KDA.

1729
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:01,090
For that mission, I want us to...

1730
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:04,910
How do I say?

1731
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:11,770
I want us to enjoy the atmosphere.

1732
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:15,870
I don't think it's this one.

1733
01:45:17,490 --> 01:45:18,610
Welcome, Mobius.

1734
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:23,210
Lucky!

1735
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:26,430
There's a bunch of guys here.

1736
01:45:27,190 --> 01:45:28,450
A bunch of little men.

1737
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:31,410
Why is this acting so weird?

1738
01:45:31,570 --> 01:45:33,150
Why can't I...

1739
01:45:35,790 --> 01:45:37,970
Gosh, I really struggled with that one.

1740
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:45,330
I think you'll notice.

1741
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:03,030
Actually, I think I'm doing the covering, Mobius.

1742
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:05,170
Nevermind, I'm falling.

1743
01:46:07,870 --> 01:46:08,610
Hold it?

1744
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:10,770
OK.

1745
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:12,870
Good job.

1746
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:17,230
Wait, there's another guy.

1747
01:46:17,310 --> 01:46:17,690
There he is.

1748
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:19,390
Watch out.

1749
01:46:21,110 --> 01:46:22,010
I got him.

1750
01:46:22,850 --> 01:46:25,630
Bolton recovery helicopter is complete.

1751
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:28,170
Thanks!

1752
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:30,470
I'll take him too.

1753
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:32,450
Which way are we going?

1754
01:46:33,370 --> 01:46:35,230
We need to go...wait.

1755
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:37,290
We can go either way?

1756
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:38,270
OK, cool.

1757
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:42,530
Bolton recovery subject confirmed on board helicopter.

1758
01:46:47,130 --> 01:46:48,230
Let's go!

1759
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:51,430
Bolton recovery helicopter is complete.

1760
01:46:52,330 --> 01:46:53,770
Does it matter which way we go?

1761
01:46:59,810 --> 01:47:01,370
What does...oh wait.

1762
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:05,930
What's in the torture chamber?

1763
01:47:07,850 --> 01:47:08,570
Mysterious.

1764
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:10,750
Mysterious, mysterious, mysterious.

1765
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:15,630
Love that we got to do all these again.

1766
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:21,610
OK.

1767
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:26,880
Where is he?

1768
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:33,910
Where the heck is he?

1769
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:35,570
Oh I see the guy down there.

1770
01:47:36,590 --> 01:47:36,990
OK.

1771
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,220
Oh I see him right there.

1772
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:46,600
You got him?

1773
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,080
I'm trying to get this guy, but I'm too short.

1774
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,080
I'm too short for that man.

1775
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:54,360
Oh wait, I can get him here.

1776
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:58,140
I got him.

1777
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,360
Prisoner!

1778
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:06,640
I got you.

1779
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:11,340
I think we just stole a lady.

1780
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,660
Kazuhiro Miller, you dog!

1781
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:29,860
You ready?

1782
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:33,720
We don't have to get the guy down there.

1783
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:34,060
It's OK.

1784
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:43,060
I'm going to scoot over just a tiny bit.

1785
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,460
There we go.

1786
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:45,140
That should be better.

1787
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:47,420
Sorry.

1788
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:58,290
I got you.

1789
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:02,210
Nice!

1790
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:06,010
Wait, I can get him?

1791
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:07,410
You're going to get him?

1792
01:49:09,070 --> 01:49:09,630
Are you sure?

1793
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:10,670
I kind of want to get him.

1794
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:13,230
I had him.

1795
01:49:14,770 --> 01:49:15,690
Oh, I didn't have him.

1796
01:49:17,710 --> 01:49:19,210
Oh, I didn't have him again.

1797
01:49:20,350 --> 01:49:21,490
Mobius, you got this.

1798
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:25,130
Get his butt.

1799
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:26,030
Get his butt.

1800
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:33,520
Hey, don't go.

1801
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:34,100
Sorry.

1802
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,040
I used up all my points.

1803
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,500
In the previous rooms.

1804
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:43,700
Thanks for the stuff!

1805
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:49,520
I used up all my skill points in the previous room.

1806
01:49:53,610 --> 01:49:54,630
Where is he?

1807
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,420
Come on!

1808
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:06,660
Nice.

1809
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:10,400
What the?

1810
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,540
I was like, what happened to you?

1811
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:14,980
That's so funny.

1812
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,260
Let's take him.

1813
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:24,820
Let's go down the stairs.

1814
01:50:32,970 --> 01:50:37,070
Oh there are two of them here.

1815
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:45,970
It corrected.

1816
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:46,450
Nice.

1817
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:48,490
Thanks!

1818
01:50:51,470 --> 01:50:52,050
What?

1819
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:54,610
Somebody was talking.

1820
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:57,710
Where was he?

1821
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:59,410
Guess not.

1822
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:04,990
Is that a person over there or what?

1823
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:11,960
I'm going to extract them too.

1824
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,000
Come over here.

1825
01:51:20,180 --> 01:51:20,740
I'll show you.

1826
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:23,300
I'll show you.

1827
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:24,780
Oh, ok.

1828
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:24,820
Ok.

1829
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:29,760
Nice.

1830
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,660
Slowest teabag in history.

1831
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:46,860
He got his soda.

1832
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,740
Let's take that.

1833
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:50,640
Zero calories.

1834
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,520
I got this guy earlier.

1835
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:57,360
Is there

1836
01:52:04,780 --> 01:52:05,620
anything else we missed?

1837
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,720
I think that's it, right?

1838
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:10,240
Right?

1839
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:12,280
Oh wait, the other side.

1840
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:13,560
I think.

1841
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:15,520
I think

1842
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,580
there is another prisoner in the office.

1843
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:28,600
In this one?

1844
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:31,800
No, there wasn't anybody in here.

1845
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:33,580
Yeah.

1846
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:34,940
It's ok.

1847
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:35,680
Let's go.

1848
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:39,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1849
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:40,580
All good.

1850
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:42,440
Impressive.

1851
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:51,440
What if it's a nerd stuffed in a locker?

1852
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:55,620
Well...

1853
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:59,360
Maybe it deserves to be in there.

1854
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:11,460
No!

1855
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:12,760
No!

1856
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,780
What?

1857
01:53:17,140 --> 01:53:22,860
She finished it so fast.

1858
01:53:41,350 --> 01:53:45,580
She fulfilled her duty to America to the very end.

1859
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:48,060
Thanks to you, Snake.

1860
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:51,020
The final missing piece is now in place.

1861
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:57,120
And thus, the boss is restored to life as the normal part.

1862
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,980
I thank you.

1863
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,180
The art is so great.

1864
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:02,940
You're crazy.

1865
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:06,780
I'll let you in on a little secret, big boss.

1866
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:11,440
You see, I've already selected Peace Walker's initial target.

1867
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,260
An offshore area in the Caribbean.

1868
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:19,940
The trade winds will scatter the fallout all over the surrounding region.

1869
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:27,680
Crops and fish will die, leaving plenty of free hands to help us mass produce Peace Walker.

1870
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:29,140
So messed up.

1871
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:35,440
And wouldn't you know, someone's gone and built a pesky little fortress there.

1872
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,320
Now who would do that?

1873
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:40,760
I'm right in the middle of the target zone too.

1874
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:45,540
Oh well, all the better to test the warhead, CEP.

1875
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:46,980
You bastard.

1876
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:52,840
I wonder who will miss a ragtag band of pirates all the way out in the middle of the Caribbean.

1877
01:54:54,480 --> 01:55:02,260
But first, we're going to prove to the White House that our baby can travel the Caribbean coast on its own.

1878
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:07,100
The whole world will know of Peace Walker's versatility.

1879
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:18,980
They'll witness the birth of a deterrent that can penetrate both Communist and guerrilla-controlled territory, traverse any kind of terrain, and deliver a nuke anywhere it needs to go.

1880
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:20,300
Untouchable.

1881
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,640
Unstoppable.

1882
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:24,360
The perfect deterrent.

1883
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:26,500
The Cold War's days are numbered.

1884
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:29,340
Deterrence isn't only about America and Russia now.

1885
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:30,880
You know what?

1886
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:32,980
You're absolutely right.

1887
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:38,800
While we've been wringing our hands, China, France, even India have surpassed us.

1888
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:44,140
There's a free-for-all nuclear arms race brewing just below the surface.

1889
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:52,820
The nuclear threat will only spread, which is exactly why we must deter it here and now.

1890
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:54,080
He's such a freak.

1891
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:56,920
The Peace Walker Project is the key.

1892
01:55:58,280 --> 01:56:03,720
The advent of Peace Walker will bring calm to this restless world.

1893
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:05,540
Don't you see, Snake?

1894
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:09,900
We need nukes, controlled nukes, to have peace.

1895
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:10,780
Lies!

1896
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:13,480
Peace Walker will restore order.

1897
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:16,880
Order in the form of a new Cold War.

1898
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:22,460
But if the world is to understand the genius of our plan, we must launch.

1899
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:25,480
Uh-oh.

1900
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:27,080
Snake!

1901
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:33,360
Run, run, run, run.

1902
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:38,960
Poor paws.

1903
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:40,440
Little baby.

1904
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:46,500
We must lunch.

1905
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:50,280
Sandwiches for all countries.

1906
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:54,180
Sign of potato chips.

1907
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:10,040
Snake, I think you're gonna need a bigger gun.

1908
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:24,640
Look at him just staring at it.

1909
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,960
Peace Walker.

1910
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:40,250
Failed, deadly, AI controlled.

1911
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:41,870
Is this a walking tank?

1912
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:48,930
The music is so good.

1913
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:53,050
More like Peace Hobbler.

1914
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:54,830
This thing is so slow.

1915
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:00,910
Snake!

1916
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:08,310
Uh-oh.

1917
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:15,820
Why didn't you say that beforehand?

1918
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:21,820
Target suppression mode.

1919
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:27,700
Right now, Peace Walker's highest priority target is you.

1920
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:29,040
Here it comes.

1921
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,500
Here it comes.

1922
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:33,980
The time has come and so has Peace Walker.

1923
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:40,780
Ta-da!

1924
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:45,500
To be continued.

1925
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:49,400
Sorry.

1926
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:51,520
Trying to wake up a little bit at least.

1927
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:54,360
My money is on mint.

1928
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:55,800
Really?

1929
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:01,680
Nice!

1930
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,920
11 people vaulted.

1931
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:04,660
Let's go.

1932
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:10,780
I should bring...wait, I should what?

1933
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:15,080
I should have brought...my Raptor?

1934
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:15,800
What's that?

1935
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:15,920
That's it.

1936
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:26,800
I have to go to the little ghosties room in a second, but then we'll of course...

1937
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:32,200
I wonder if the law, the new law has...

1938
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,180
Smelt!

1939
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:35,420
Holy moly.

1940
01:59:36,140 --> 01:59:36,860
Wait, ok, hold on.

1941
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:39,100
Let's see if our weapons...

1942
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:39,320
Ah!

1943
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:40,420
65%!

1944
01:59:40,580 --> 01:59:40,800
No!

1945
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:42,860
So close.

1946
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:45,520
Oh well.

1947
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:48,460
More mate.

1948
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,960
He must have dealt it.

1949
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:56,660
Let's see our lovely ladies.

1950
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:58,780
Oh Bob, why?

1951
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:02,860
She's burning...wait, we got two Axolotls and one...

1952
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:05,520
One of them is going to have to die.

1953
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:10,850
Firefly.

1954
02:00:11,010 --> 02:00:11,390
Wait!

1955
02:00:12,030 --> 02:00:16,710
Of Honkai fame we have Firefly?

1956
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:22,110
Oh my god!

1957
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:32,020
On my mother base?

1958
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:32,820
Wow.

1959
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:34,380
Wow, Duckyball.

1960
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:38,080
Where's Ducky?

1961
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:39,680
You guys are so stupid.

1962
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:43,800
Gecko, Bobwhite...

1963
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:45,620
Wait, we have two Bobwhites also!

1964
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:47,820
What's going on here?

1965
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:53,680
We have normal Bobwhite and...

1966
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:55,220
Wait, what's going on?

1967
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:56,200
How did this happen?

1968
02:00:59,120 --> 02:00:59,800
What?

1969
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:01,780
Skunk?

1970
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:03,880
Oh that's what the guy smelt.

1971
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:07,500
Gamboja?

1972
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:09,380
What the hell is that?

1973
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:20,250
There's Bob's terribles.

1974
02:01:23,490 --> 02:01:24,370
Oh nice.

1975
02:01:24,530 --> 02:01:25,970
Wait, we actually have some new stuff.

1976
02:01:26,690 --> 02:01:28,350
Wait, why can't I assign Bob?

1977
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:30,870
Wait, you're good in R&D.

1978
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:32,050
Is my R&D...

1979
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:33,750
My R&D team is full!

1980
02:01:33,970 --> 02:01:34,450
Ok, hold on.

1981
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:36,750
Let's take out some poopy guys.

1982
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:39,990
Who's our lowest ranking?

1983
02:01:46,270 --> 02:01:49,350
Oh, everybody's kind of leveled up so they're all pretty good.

1984
02:01:50,550 --> 02:01:51,870
It must be you though.

1985
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:55,190
What else do you have good?

1986
02:01:56,370 --> 02:01:56,810
Food.

1987
02:01:57,010 --> 02:01:58,150
I'll send you to the mess hall.

1988
02:02:02,150 --> 02:02:04,050
Oops, and then...

1989
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:06,150
Yeah, you're really good.

1990
02:02:06,270 --> 02:02:07,530
Let's get you in R&D.

1991
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:09,490
Ok, nice.

1992
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:23,630
We had like so few things.

1993
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:26,270
Stun gun!

1994
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:38,860
Hmm...

1995
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:40,620
Hmm...

1996
02:02:40,620 --> 02:02:42,700
I know we had the shield.

1997
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:44,580
I don't really use the shield.

1998
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:48,580
I don't really use the sonic eye either much.

1999
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:50,240
I just go on instinct, baby.

2000
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:51,560
Ok, give me one second guys.

2001
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:52,980
I'm going to use the little ghost's room.

2002
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:55,280
And then we shall fight.

2003
02:02:56,900 --> 02:02:57,720
We shall fight.

2004
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:00,660
Actually, I'm also going to grab more of some drinks.

2005
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:05,440
Ok.

2006
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:09,060
Ok, I'll be right back.

2007
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:31,290
Give me one second.

2008
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:34,250
I've got to send something real fast.

2009
02:06:57,050 --> 02:06:58,680
We are good.

2010
02:06:58,920 --> 02:06:59,300
Let's go.

2011
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:01,560
Mission selector!

2012
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:05,820
Cat petted.

2013
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:06,500
Absolutely.

2014
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,640
The music!

2015
02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:13,980
Stop peace walker.

2016
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:15,900
Ok.

2017
02:07:16,820 --> 02:07:18,980
Who's ready to fight for peace?

2018
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:21,040
Four paws!

2019
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:22,840
My cat.

2020
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:25,680
What did you catch fish in?

2021
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:33,400
I caught a mutated gar and a mutated salmon.

2022
02:07:36,980 --> 02:07:38,220
Very exciting.

2023
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:45,240
Thank you for the gift.

2024
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:45,840
Thank you.

2025
02:07:45,860 --> 02:07:48,580
Thank you guys for all the chat too while I was gone.

2026
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,200
Ok.

2027
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:51,700
Host.

2028
02:08:03,290 --> 02:08:04,450
Gone with the tea.

2029
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:08,790
Welcome Nero Mobius.

2030
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:10,170
Perky boy.

2031
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:13,730
Welcome.

2032
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:22,560
Gone with the tea.

2033
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:30,380
Going with the wisps too fast.

2034
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:32,240
Sorry.

2035
02:08:33,420 --> 02:08:34,520
I love the beach.

2036
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:36,120
Say it.

2037
02:08:37,660 --> 02:08:37,880
Yeah!

2038
02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:43,720
Is this the last mission?

2039
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:44,460
It is not.

2040
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:46,060
No worries.

2041
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:04,690
Actually yeah, there is a lot left to the game.

2042
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:07,650
Not to be too spoilery but...

2043
02:09:07,650 --> 02:09:10,510
There is actually quite a bit left of the game.

2044
02:09:13,970 --> 02:09:15,170
Going with the tea.

2045
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:20,170
Gone with the tea.

2046
02:09:23,390 --> 02:09:27,610
That's kind of what I love about this game though is that it's so much.

2047
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:35,740
There is so much with this game.

2048
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:36,260
We ready?

2049
02:09:36,940 --> 02:09:37,920
Are you ready Perky boy?

2050
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:42,800
And for a PSP game, you know.

2051
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:44,360
Alright, let's go!

2052
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:47,540
Solar, thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

2053
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:48,320
Thank you.

2054
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:52,660
Yeah, it doesn't overstay its welcome.

2055
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:55,700
No, the story stays really good.

2056
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:07,220
But, I think it also helps that a lot of the missions are...

2057
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:11,680
There is only one series of missions that really kind of suck.

2058
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:13,980
And if you know, you know.

2059
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:16,100
Don't say anything, obviously.

2060
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:17,680
But...

2061
02:10:18,940 --> 02:10:22,140
Those series of missions suck, but everything else is...

2062
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:24,600
Yeah, they are kind of bite-sized, so they are good.

2063
02:10:29,030 --> 02:10:30,590
If you know, you know.

2064
02:10:31,210 --> 02:10:32,670
If you know, you know.

2065
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:34,810
And if you don't know, you will know eventually.

2066
02:10:36,850 --> 02:10:40,370
So don't worry your pretty little head about it.

2067
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:46,970
Looking for the tea gang!

2068
02:10:53,110 --> 02:10:54,370
Greetings from Costa Rica.

2069
02:10:54,630 --> 02:10:55,670
Thank you!

2070
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:56,790
Thank you Florent!

2071
02:10:56,950 --> 02:10:57,830
A whole year!

2072
02:10:57,930 --> 02:10:59,030
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2073
02:11:00,430 --> 02:11:01,790
Thank you so much.

2074
02:11:03,370 --> 02:11:05,250
The PP flamethrower.

2075
02:11:06,090 --> 02:11:08,250
Huey was like, how can we improve this design?

2076
02:11:08,970 --> 02:11:10,310
Where is the mammal pod?

2077
02:11:10,490 --> 02:11:11,070
Oh, there it is.

2078
02:11:14,270 --> 02:11:15,230
It's on his butt.

2079
02:11:17,330 --> 02:11:19,070
It's not on his butt, it's on his head.

2080
02:11:21,170 --> 02:11:21,570
I

2081
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:28,000
guess we can get the butt though.

2082
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:29,500
Oh, there is one on his butt.

2083
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:44,280
Face me!

2084
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:49,720
Don't like that, don't like that.

2085
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:06,900
Go team go!

2086
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:10,180
Go team go!

2087
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:23,630
It's like the fastest battle ever.

2088
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:35,710
It barely held any...

2089
02:12:37,150 --> 02:12:38,050
Anything.

2090
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:46,760
I'm so sad.

2091
02:13:02,890 --> 02:13:04,190
Miku are you OK?

2092
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:09,890
I'm getting bossed too, bossed too.

2093
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:19,170
Started the fight, my stream buffered and the fight was over?

2094
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:19,770
No way!

2095
02:13:21,150 --> 02:13:23,610
YouTube has been so stinky though lately with the buffering.

2096
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:32,130
Maybe I should like, get out of the way.

2097
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:43,180
He's so stoic, he's so funny.

2098
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:51,900
It's so funny because in these cutscenes he never has any sort of emotion, except just...

2099
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:53,280
Snake stare.

2100
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:02,020
She's gonna hobble away.

2101
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,060
Nevermind.

2102
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:09,300
She's gonna zoom away.

2103
02:14:13,310 --> 02:14:14,130
Uh-oh.

2104
02:14:15,010 --> 02:14:16,170
Where did those come from?

2105
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:17,550
Oh my gosh, shake it off like a doll.

2106
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:26,500
It's the thief's hog, yeah!

2107
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:32,600
Real peace walker.

2108
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:42,200
Bye peace walker!

2109
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,560
What do you expect me to do?

2110
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:46,860
This thing is humongous.

2111
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:50,600
It's climbing over hills and mountains.

2112
02:14:54,740 --> 02:14:56,400
Go snake, go!

2113
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:00,540
Haunt!

2114
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:07,600
Now we're really fast.

2115
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:11,880
What if we all put our legs together?

2116
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:14,060
All four of us.

2117
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:17,900
Yeah!

2118
02:15:24,940 --> 02:15:26,340
Come on!

2119
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:36,490
That's it?

2120
02:15:38,090 --> 02:15:39,610
Only 25?

2121
02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:49,850
You're starving.

2122
02:15:51,710 --> 02:15:52,030
Go!

2123
02:16:04,670 --> 02:16:05,310
Nice.

2124
02:16:09,570 --> 02:16:12,730
Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid...

2125
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:27,720
Ok, we're good, we're good.

2126
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:30,200
I'm bashing, I'm bashing.

2127
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:32,560
Ok.

2128
02:16:34,940 --> 02:16:37,640
I feel like horses can go over 30 miles per hour.

2129
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:38,220
Is that supposed to mean?

2130
02:16:40,940 --> 02:16:42,380
No, I pressed it.

2131
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:44,280
I pressed it, I pressed it.

2132
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:57,280
Oh my god.

2133
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:00,100
My hand!

2134
02:17:03,740 --> 02:17:06,300
It's weak from having to do this earlier twice.

2135
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:12,660
That was so close.

2136
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:20,500
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2137
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:44,440
It hurts, it hurts.

2138
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,040
It hurts, it hurts.

2139
02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:48,720
No!

2140
02:17:50,740 --> 02:17:54,440
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

2141
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:02,560
No!

2142
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:22,320
Good job boss.

2143
02:18:22,380 --> 02:18:22,820
Thank you.

2144
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:24,660
Oh no!

2145
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:31,580
Why did you think the horse could go upside, like up walls like Spiderman?

2146
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:34,520
Horse!

2147
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:49,820
Just taking a little swim.

2148
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:51,840
Just taking a dip.

2149
02:18:58,260 --> 02:19:01,900
He treated the horse like a goat, like a mountain goat.

2150
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:02,320
No!

2151
02:19:09,390 --> 02:19:11,850
This isn't Skyrim.

2152
02:19:15,830 --> 02:19:18,210
Have you guys ever watched like mountain goat stuff?

2153
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:27,090
Nice job everybody!

2154
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:32,110
Let's go another SRank battle dress.

2155
02:19:33,850 --> 02:19:35,310
Let's take it easy.

2156
02:20:12,270 --> 02:20:12,630
Guys...

2157
02:20:14,590 --> 02:20:16,370
I need my room to the stream chat.

2158
02:20:17,050 --> 02:20:19,130
When was the last time you put your bedsheets in the wash?

2159
02:20:20,330 --> 02:20:20,690
Yeah.

2160
02:20:21,550 --> 02:20:23,150
You're supposed to do it once a week everybody.

2161
02:20:39,850 --> 02:20:41,770
Who wants some buns?

2162
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:46,590
About this.

2163
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:49,050
You can wash them.

2164
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:03,970
Basilisco.

2165
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:05,030
Basilisco.

2166
02:21:07,830 --> 02:21:08,430
Cosibolca.

2167
02:21:11,210 --> 02:21:12,690
Speak like a muncher, thank you.

2168
02:21:19,050 --> 02:21:22,430
Nicaragua, at the mercy of someone like William Walker again.

2169
02:21:23,610 --> 02:21:26,510
Snake, Coldman's going to launch the nuke from that base.

2170
02:21:26,990 --> 02:21:28,250
He's targeting MSF.

2171
02:21:28,830 --> 02:21:32,790
Based on what Huey's told us, it'll take two more days to prep for launch.

2172
02:21:33,230 --> 02:21:35,630
But it looks like there's another reason they picked that date.

2173
02:21:36,170 --> 02:21:36,950
What's that?

2174
02:21:37,410 --> 02:21:41,150
Tomorrow is day one of a US-Soviet summit in Vladivostok.

2175
02:21:41,410 --> 02:21:43,490
The launch is probably connected somehow.

2176
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:44,510
That's right.

2177
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:46,430
They're holding the salt too tight.

2178
02:21:46,690 --> 02:21:49,270
You think Coldman's trying to disrupt the negotiations?

2179
02:21:50,410 --> 02:21:52,950
Either that or use it as a bargaining chip.

2180
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:54,150
He's still got P.O.S.

2181
02:21:54,430 --> 02:21:54,450
too.

2182
02:21:54,910 --> 02:21:56,950
At any rate, we're running out of time.

2183
02:21:57,210 --> 02:21:58,850
I'll figure something out.

2184
02:22:02,690 --> 02:22:04,230
Hot salt man.

2185
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:14,980
I won't rest until I get answers.

2186
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:16,340
Yeah!

2187
02:22:16,920 --> 02:22:18,500
We finally got our law, baby.

2188
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:20,280
Nice.

2189
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,720
And we've got some more men because they were...

2190
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:24,620
We got quail.

2191
02:22:25,960 --> 02:22:27,940
Quail's pretty solid all around.

2192
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:28,940
Antelope too.

2193
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:31,020
Smelt is good for combat.

2194
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:35,700
Nice.

2195
02:22:39,140 --> 02:22:43,960
Everything... Our R&D is getting pretty full.

2196
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:45,020
Oh, horse!

2197
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:53,260
We're gonna have to start swapping out some guys to get better things, I think.

2198
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:01,770
We'll save on stuff for now.

2199
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:03,190
Let's keep going with some missions.

2200
02:23:06,710 --> 02:23:08,610
Horse reincarnated into a soldier.

2201
02:23:08,810 --> 02:23:09,830
It's so sad.

2202
02:23:10,510 --> 02:23:11,330
The horse.

2203
02:23:21,170 --> 02:23:22,370
Communications Tower.

2204
02:23:40,210 --> 02:23:40,870
Okay.

2205
02:23:42,810 --> 02:23:45,730
Who wants to also join me for infiltrating the U.S.

2206
02:23:45,830 --> 02:23:46,990
Missile Base?

2207
02:23:52,110 --> 02:23:52,650
Micmac!

2208
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:54,430
Alright.

2209
02:23:55,070 --> 02:23:56,530
I'll take off my T-shirt now.

2210
02:24:00,430 --> 02:24:02,430
Wait, we got the new battle suit too.

2211
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:02,810
Yeah!

2212
02:24:04,110 --> 02:24:05,190
Look guys.

2213
02:24:06,590 --> 02:24:08,850
The battle suit's so cool!

2214
02:24:11,810 --> 02:24:12,730
What was that?

2215
02:24:14,010 --> 02:24:15,350
What did you just put on?

2216
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:18,950
What did you just...

2217
02:24:22,530 --> 02:24:23,950
What did you just put on?

2218
02:24:32,250 --> 02:24:34,730
That was not my snake, I don't think.

2219
02:24:36,670 --> 02:24:37,990
Because I didn't change.

2220
02:24:42,860 --> 02:24:43,700
It's time?

2221
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:46,200
Wait, is this the... Is this the mission?

2222
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:50,240
Is this the important mission?

2223
02:24:51,320 --> 02:24:52,760
Should I bring something bigger?

2224
02:24:53,540 --> 02:24:54,600
Ah, the M60 works.

2225
02:24:57,840 --> 02:24:58,620
Not yet.

2226
02:24:58,740 --> 02:24:58,920
Okay.

2227
02:24:59,340 --> 02:24:59,900
Not yet.

2228
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:01,400
Let's go.

2229
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:05,240
The important... It is the important mission.

2230
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:07,860
Just warn me before it's the important mission.

2231
02:25:09,460 --> 02:25:10,220
Next one.

2232
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:10,720
Okay, okay.

2233
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:16,140
I knew it was soon.

2234
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:18,200
I'm like, hello, where is it?

2235
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:19,820
The important mission.

2236
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:20,940
Ah!

2237
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:25,720
Let's go baby.

2238
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:33,110
Chapter 4.

2239
02:25:33,230 --> 02:25:34,630
Wow, we already got through chapter 3.

2240
02:25:34,930 --> 02:25:36,090
The illusion of peace.

2241
02:25:37,810 --> 02:25:39,970
I think it will say no Walkman for the important one.

2242
02:25:40,110 --> 02:25:41,410
Ah, that makes sense.

2243
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:44,050
That makes sense, right?

2244
02:25:48,390 --> 02:25:53,330
Sorry, I'm covering Amanda's face.

2245
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:57,530
Take a horse.

2246
02:26:57,300 --> 02:27:00,100
There is only room for one boss.

2247
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:03,080
And one snake.

2248
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:09,420
Wait, I didn't even do it.

2249
02:27:13,570 --> 02:27:14,870
Micmac you monster.

2250
02:27:16,010 --> 02:27:17,110
Micmac you monster!

2251
02:27:17,950 --> 02:27:19,010
I didn't do that.

2252
02:27:21,410 --> 02:27:22,090
What?

2253
02:27:27,190 --> 02:27:29,470
He was so fast about it too.

2254
02:27:31,210 --> 02:27:33,430
Oh my god.

2255
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:40,630
It wasn't me.

2256
02:27:41,370 --> 02:27:42,530
I didn't pull any triggers.

2257
02:27:49,350 --> 02:27:51,870
The boss wouldn't be allowed to come back home alive.

2258
02:27:52,810 --> 02:27:55,170
And she wouldn't be allowed to kill herself.

2259
02:27:56,310 --> 02:27:59,670
Her life would be ended by her most beloved disciple.

2260
02:28:00,830 --> 02:28:03,110
That was the way that the government wanted it.

2261
02:28:04,110 --> 02:28:06,070
That was the mission she was given.

2262
02:28:06,970 --> 02:28:10,430
The tainted disgrace will follow her to her grave.

2263
02:28:14,150 --> 02:28:15,270
Future generations...

2264
02:28:15,270 --> 02:28:16,670
Not for honor, but for you.

2265
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:19,810
In America as a despicable traitor with no sense of honor.

2266
02:28:20,990 --> 02:28:24,630
And in Russia as a monster who unleashed a nuclear catastrophe.

2267
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:30,270
She will go down in official history as a war criminal.

2268
02:28:33,210 --> 02:28:35,470
That was her final mission.

2269
02:28:41,350 --> 02:28:42,010
Snake...

2270
02:28:42,010 --> 02:28:44,910
History will never know what she did.

2271
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:48,830
No one will ever learn the truth.

2272
02:28:51,190 --> 02:28:52,510
Her story...

2273
02:28:52,510 --> 02:28:55,050
Her debriefing...

2274
02:28:55,050 --> 02:28:58,350
Will endure only in your heart.

2275
02:29:00,130 --> 02:29:02,770
Everything she did, she did for her country.

2276
02:29:03,910 --> 02:29:05,450
She sacrificed her life for her country.

2277
02:29:05,450 --> 02:29:08,830
Her life and her honor for her native land.

2278
02:29:10,070 --> 02:29:11,950
She was a real hero.

2279
02:29:14,490 --> 02:29:17,350
She was a true patriot.

2280
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:26,060
Something's not right.

2281
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:28,560
Key card doesn't look too bad.

2282
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:29,500
What do you think?

2283
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:30,940
Gonna need some help.

2284
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:33,060
07s...

2285
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:35,300
0707...

2286
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:41,660
Snake is just our troubled man.

2287
02:29:41,820 --> 02:29:42,800
He's so troubled.

2288
02:29:43,860 --> 02:29:45,240
He has so much guilt.

2289
02:29:46,260 --> 02:29:47,320
Makes him stupid.

2290
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:48,940
He was already stupid.

2291
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:52,100
Nice.

2292
02:29:59,220 --> 02:29:59,880
Okay.

2293
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,280
They're targeting Mother Base.

2294
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:11,380
Don't you think you should evacuate?

2295
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:12,640
Nah.

2296
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:15,440
Everybody here believes in you, boss.

2297
02:30:16,780 --> 02:30:18,160
Alright, fine then.

2298
02:30:18,940 --> 02:30:21,040
I've kind of gotten attached to the place myself.

2299
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:21,800
Me too!

2300
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:22,900
Me too!

2301
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:25,860
They've been taken to safety.

2302
02:30:26,340 --> 02:30:28,120
We can't involve them in this any further.

2303
02:30:29,140 --> 02:30:29,520
Good.

2304
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:32,680
They've got their own cause to fight for.

2305
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:35,180
And Snake...

2306
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:37,240
Don't forget the bad guys have got P.O.S.

2307
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:38,920
I won't.

2308
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:43,140
We're prepping a few backup units.

2309
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:44,780
Don't let them launch, Snake.

2310
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:46,380
We're counting on you.

2311
02:30:46,900 --> 02:30:53,080
No spoilers

2312
02:30:57,810 --> 02:30:58,610
you guys!

2313
02:30:58,650 --> 02:31:01,570
There's people in chat that have not played the game.

2314
02:31:01,770 --> 02:31:02,850
Please no spoilers.

2315
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:03,810
Thank you.

2316
02:31:15,810 --> 02:31:18,050
Holy crack!

2317
02:31:20,810 --> 02:31:21,590
Wow!

2318
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:32,860
Get this...

2319
02:31:32,860 --> 02:31:35,760
Get this girl in...

2320
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:37,360
Oh my gosh!

2321
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:39,480
A Magic the Gathering room!

2322
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,760
Her crack...

2323
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,620
is totally out!

2324
02:31:53,380 --> 02:31:56,420
Actually, I'm gonna have this smoke grenade.

2325
02:32:00,340 --> 02:32:01,240
What the hell?

2326
02:32:01,820 --> 02:32:02,500
This is messed up.

2327
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:03,120
Get back!

2328
02:32:03,980 --> 02:32:06,160
Why would you do this to me?

2329
02:32:06,460 --> 02:32:07,540
Oh, I see him.

2330
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:09,580
Hold on, I'll get this guy.

2331
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:14,280
Holy...

2332
02:32:14,280 --> 02:32:14,680
Oh shoot.

2333
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:15,980
No, don't say anything.

2334
02:32:16,700 --> 02:32:18,060
No, you didn't say anything.

2335
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:19,460
Oh shoot.

2336
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:22,000
No, I messed up!

2337
02:32:24,860 --> 02:32:25,860
No, I messed up!

2338
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:32,460
Dang it.

2339
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:38,040
Let's get this guy...secretly.

2340
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:44,160
Oh, you can't see me though.

2341
02:32:44,200 --> 02:32:44,640
You stupid.

2342
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,220
Oh, my bad.

2343
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:48,900
Why are you so smart?

2344
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:52,960
I messed up.

2345
02:32:53,560 --> 02:32:55,160
Mic Mac, I messed up my aim.

2346
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:58,040
The stealth messed up my aim.

2347
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:02,340
Nice.

2348
02:33:04,180 --> 02:33:05,640
I'm gonna be brave too.

2349
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:08,940
Tick-a-dink, tick-a-dink, tick-a-dink, tick-a-dink.

2350
02:33:12,080 --> 02:33:12,960
All clear!

2351
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:16,760
That's so smart.

2352
02:33:18,320 --> 02:33:19,540
They're so dumb.

2353
02:33:24,340 --> 02:33:25,720
Can I get this thing?

2354
02:33:28,100 --> 02:33:29,000
You think I should?

2355
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:31,280
Oh my god, he's so close.

2356
02:33:31,640 --> 02:33:32,520
But they'll hear it, no?

2357
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:39,080
Nobody even heard a thing.

2358
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:41,420
Oh, they definitely heard a thing.

2359
02:33:49,900 --> 02:33:51,080
Who's down there anyway?

2360
02:33:54,220 --> 02:33:55,340
Don't worry about them.

2361
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:56,700
They're probably babies.

2362
02:33:58,060 --> 02:33:59,360
Oh, I hear somebody.

2363
02:34:00,440 --> 02:34:01,400
Probably from up there.

2364
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:05,260
Stop making me invisible, it's weird.

2365
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:06,820
Oh, I didn't mean to...

2366
02:34:06,820 --> 02:34:08,280
What are you doing?

2367
02:34:08,540 --> 02:34:10,000
Why'd you do that?

2368
02:34:12,320 --> 02:34:13,140
No!

2369
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:13,780
No!

2370
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:16,680
There we go.

2371
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:24,140
I want to join you!

2372
02:34:25,240 --> 02:34:25,720
OK

2373
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:31,520
He wants to join.

2374
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:34,620
That was kinda loud.

2375
02:34:34,740 --> 02:34:36,780
Oh, you got him.

2376
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:37,140
Nice.

2377
02:34:44,210 --> 02:34:44,690
Sneak in.

2378
02:34:44,830 --> 02:34:45,190
Sneak out.

2379
02:34:46,270 --> 02:34:47,330
How do we get up from here?

2380
02:34:48,270 --> 02:34:48,570
Oh, here.

2381
02:34:51,750 --> 02:34:52,470
Oh my gosh.

2382
02:35:04,270 --> 02:35:05,770
That was quiet.

2383
02:35:10,170 --> 02:35:12,690
Ah, nice and quiet.

2384
02:35:15,290 --> 02:35:16,370
They don't.

2385
02:35:16,490 --> 02:35:17,250
They're stupid.

2386
02:35:19,250 --> 02:35:20,350
Yeah, what stealth?

2387
02:35:20,430 --> 02:35:21,330
We don't need stealth.

2388
02:35:23,790 --> 02:35:25,630
We don't need stealth.

2389
02:35:40,470 --> 02:35:42,650
McMahon kinda cheeked up.

2390
02:35:47,350 --> 02:35:49,490
This one is...

2391
02:35:49,490 --> 02:35:51,010
Oh yeah, I remember this.

2392
02:35:53,610 --> 02:35:54,830
Look at you.

2393
02:35:55,810 --> 02:35:57,930
I don't get to do such fancy stuff.

2394
02:36:12,270 --> 02:36:13,390
What is...

2395
02:36:20,670 --> 02:36:21,010
Prisoner.

2396
02:36:21,350 --> 02:36:21,910
Oh, hello.

2397
02:36:22,090 --> 02:36:23,510
Oh gosh, you scared me.

2398
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:25,170
You scared me McMahon.

2399
02:36:25,530 --> 02:36:26,170
Oh my gosh.

2400
02:36:28,590 --> 02:36:31,930
You scared me like nothing else.

2401
02:36:32,810 --> 02:36:34,750
Oh my gosh, this man.

2402
02:36:48,410 --> 02:36:49,370
Start talking.

2403
02:36:50,870 --> 02:36:52,230
Oh he also wants to join.

2404
02:36:54,730 --> 02:36:58,550
Wait, can I...oh shoot.

2405
02:36:58,930 --> 02:36:59,530
You want to join us?

2406
02:37:00,310 --> 02:37:00,770
You want to join?

2407
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:02,650
You want to join?

2408
02:37:04,830 --> 02:37:05,730
Let him in.

2409
02:37:05,790 --> 02:37:06,610
Let him in.

2410
02:37:08,130 --> 02:37:09,650
We just gotta open this door, no?

2411
02:37:11,130 --> 02:37:11,910
What you say?

2412
02:37:13,350 --> 02:37:14,590
What you say?

2413
02:37:16,510 --> 02:37:17,350
Come on.

2414
02:37:19,130 --> 02:37:19,470
Oh wait.

2415
02:37:19,710 --> 02:37:21,370
Oh sorry, my bad.

2416
02:37:22,030 --> 02:37:22,450
Hello?

2417
02:37:23,430 --> 02:37:24,570
Don't I just gotta open this?

2418
02:37:26,390 --> 02:37:26,810
Ouch!

2419
02:37:27,330 --> 02:37:27,710
What?

2420
02:37:30,690 --> 02:37:31,110
What?

2421
02:37:32,590 --> 02:37:34,550
Isn't it that you have to do that here?

2422
02:37:35,670 --> 02:37:36,510
Not this door?

2423
02:37:36,730 --> 02:37:37,530
Oh, where was it?

2424
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:41,590
It is literally...how do I open it again?

2425
02:37:41,650 --> 02:37:42,050
I don't remember.

2426
02:37:42,050 --> 02:37:43,310
Ok, I'm following you.

2427
02:37:55,710 --> 02:37:57,750
I thought we had to go into the big tunnel, no?

2428
02:37:58,950 --> 02:37:59,450
Where is it?

2429
02:38:05,350 --> 02:38:05,750
Nobody.

2430
02:38:08,030 --> 02:38:08,430
No!

2431
02:38:09,210 --> 02:38:10,650
Oh wait, this is the goal.

2432
02:38:10,990 --> 02:38:12,210
Wait, I was...

2433
02:38:12,210 --> 02:38:16,310
I think I'm all backwards.

2434
02:38:16,450 --> 02:38:17,110
Sorry guys.

2435
02:38:17,870 --> 02:38:18,750
The tunnel is later.

2436
02:38:18,910 --> 02:38:20,910
Oh, I'm all backwards right now you guys.

2437
02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:21,530
I'm so sorry.

2438
02:38:23,570 --> 02:38:25,150
I was misremembering.

2439
02:38:26,510 --> 02:38:27,110
Oopsie!

2440
02:38:36,130 --> 02:38:39,350
I'll find specimens over here.

2441
02:38:40,810 --> 02:38:42,310
Oh yeah!

2442
02:38:42,770 --> 02:38:43,170
Oh yeah!

2443
02:38:47,850 --> 02:38:48,950
Ah!

2444
02:38:54,970 --> 02:38:55,230
Ah!

2445
02:38:55,370 --> 02:38:55,770
Please!

2446
02:38:56,750 --> 02:38:57,830
There we go.

2447
02:38:57,950 --> 02:38:58,390
Bye!

2448
02:39:11,870 --> 02:39:13,810
He's mine!

2449
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:25,680
CQC baby!

2450
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:29,720
What is going on down there?

2451
02:39:36,530 --> 02:39:37,990
Get his butt!

2452
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:43,160
You could have warned me about that.

2453
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:45,800
Oh, please.

2454
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:47,080
Please.

2455
02:39:54,040 --> 02:39:55,680
My eyes!

2456
02:39:57,300 --> 02:39:58,120
Ok!

2457
02:39:58,120 --> 02:39:58,540
My eyes!

2458
02:39:58,760 --> 02:39:59,320
Oh, shoot.

2459
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,980
Gosh, I...

2460
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:06,680
I'm so sorry.

2461
02:40:06,740 --> 02:40:07,560
I didn't notice.

2462
02:40:09,540 --> 02:40:10,680
I didn't notice.

2463
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:11,760
Bring me back to life!

2464
02:40:13,060 --> 02:40:13,960
I'm sorry.

2465
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:15,000
I'm sorry.

2466
02:40:15,500 --> 02:40:17,540
I didn't notice that I was...

2467
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:18,460
That I... I'm sorry.

2468
02:40:18,980 --> 02:40:20,040
I'll quit my rations.

2469
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:24,280
Oh, but I gotta get this guy home.

2470
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:28,840
I'm sorry.

2471
02:40:29,180 --> 02:40:30,440
I didn't notice.

2472
02:40:30,660 --> 02:40:31,120
I didn't...

2473
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:36,360
This guy is just like chillin' in the mud.

2474
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:45,900
He's gonna fall asleep!

2475
02:40:56,760 --> 02:40:57,320
Boss?

2476
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:57,920
Boss!

2477
02:40:58,600 --> 02:41:02,740
Yeah, we got saved by this fine piece of art.

2478
02:41:04,980 --> 02:41:05,740
Mmhm.

2479
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:08,900
Ah yeah!

2480
02:41:10,220 --> 02:41:12,600
The nice view, I know, right?

2481
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:14,260
Eyes.

2482
02:41:19,300 --> 02:41:20,060
Eyes!

2483
02:41:20,680 --> 02:41:21,360
Snake!

2484
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:23,600
Can you hear me?

2485
02:41:24,020 --> 02:41:25,860
Si, I can hear you.

2486
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:27,280
Where are you?

2487
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:28,640
I'm not sure.

2488
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:30,480
I don't recognize it.

2489
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:32,040
What about Coldman?

2490
02:41:32,040 --> 02:41:34,900
He just left for the control tower.

2491
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:37,380
Said something about entering the final data.

2492
02:41:37,580 --> 02:41:38,680
That doesn't seem...

2493
02:41:38,680 --> 02:41:40,820
What is the matter?

2494
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:42,260
That doesn't seem good.

2495
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:47,880
Uh-oh.

2496
02:41:51,260 --> 02:41:53,340
Ah, the doubles.

2497
02:42:05,940 --> 02:42:08,740
Easy peasy.

2498
02:42:08,920 --> 02:42:14,420
What is going on?

2499
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:19,000
I love this picture.

2500
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:20,180
I'm coming, Paz.

2501
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:22,320
Do not worry about me.

2502
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:26,040
I am an angel of peace.

2503
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:28,580
I will be watching over you.

2504
02:42:29,720 --> 02:42:31,260
I love her so much!

2505
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:35,420
I love her so much!

2506
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:40,760
My sweet angel of peace!

2507
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:45,940
I love Paz so much.

2508
02:42:51,380 --> 02:42:53,380
Wow, I got a lot of heroism.

2509
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:53,920
Let's go!

2510
02:42:55,900 --> 02:42:56,940
Good job team!

2511
02:42:57,740 --> 02:42:59,120
CQC master!

2512
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:03,520
We got some guys.

2513
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:04,340
We got some prisoners.

2514
02:43:08,020 --> 02:43:08,920
Do you love her so much?

2515
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:09,640
Why don't you marry her?

2516
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:10,400
I would if I could.

2517
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:12,500
I absolutely would.

2518
02:43:12,860 --> 02:43:14,020
I would marry Paz.

2519
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:17,680
Pacifica Ocean!

2520
02:43:24,060 --> 02:43:26,140
Give me a smelt again.

2521
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:27,340
This guy sucks.

2522
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:30,640
Let's see.

2523
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:31,360
Llama.

2524
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:35,940
Llama, our little engineer.

2525
02:43:37,720 --> 02:43:38,420
Good morning Minto.

2526
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:40,520
I've been told you recruited my wife Firefly.

2527
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:42,540
I hope she's doing good work at Mother Base.

2528
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:45,640
She kind of sucks, but that's okay.

2529
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:52,500
And Peefowl and Iguana.

2530
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:56,140
Not to be mistaken for the elusive Sea Iguana.

2531
02:43:56,600 --> 02:43:58,240
Oh my gosh, pig sucks.

2532
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:00,600
Sockeye Salmon.

2533
02:44:01,320 --> 02:44:02,120
Dove is pretty good.

2534
02:44:07,410 --> 02:44:11,630
We got to start weaning out the weenies of the R&D.

2535
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:17,920
Okay!

2536
02:44:19,020 --> 02:44:22,400
This next mission is important everybody.

2537
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:25,220
And I would like to enjoy the moment.

2538
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:31,860
So, maybe don't take out the helicopter too quickly.

2539
02:44:32,040 --> 02:44:32,460
Okay!

2540
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:33,880
If you are the one who joins.

2541
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:37,160
And Drinkles thank you so much for the 20 gifts.

2542
02:44:37,220 --> 02:44:38,100
Thank you!

2543
02:44:40,120 --> 02:44:41,220
Space Iguana.

2544
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:50,660
So...yeah, just...yeah.

2545
02:44:52,780 --> 02:44:54,300
Just...yeah, be support.

2546
02:44:54,480 --> 02:44:55,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2547
02:45:00,340 --> 02:45:00,540
Okay!

2548
02:45:03,400 --> 02:45:03,740
Okay!

2549
02:45:05,860 --> 02:45:09,040
I love Kaz's Call of Duty mic.

2550
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:11,100
Yeah.

2551
02:45:12,780 --> 02:45:16,000
Go a little bit slower than you usually would in this one.

2552
02:45:16,380 --> 02:45:16,720
Okay.

2553
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:21,160
Dull Bracelet.

2554
02:45:21,380 --> 02:45:21,920
Welcome, welcome.

2555
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:24,000
Welcome, welcome.

2556
02:45:24,700 --> 02:45:27,400
I think...I think actually what I have is pretty good.

2557
02:45:27,560 --> 02:45:28,880
Because I have the M60.

2558
02:45:29,660 --> 02:45:30,680
Which I can use.

2559
02:45:32,860 --> 02:45:33,340
Yeah, yeah.

2560
02:45:33,380 --> 02:45:34,100
I think it should be okay.

2561
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:39,440
Alrighty.

2562
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:44,140
Alrighty, alrighty.

2563
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:45,300
Yeah, no Walkman.

2564
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:46,180
No Walkman.

2565
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:48,400
Let's...Oh!

2566
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:48,860
Oh!

2567
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:50,520
I didn't realize I even had it.

2568
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:52,680
Oops.

2569
02:45:55,140 --> 02:45:56,780
I had the Walkman!

2570
02:46:04,450 --> 02:46:05,010
Me!

2571
02:46:07,950 --> 02:46:08,510
Oopsie.

2572
02:46:09,950 --> 02:46:10,670
It's okay.

2573
02:46:10,710 --> 02:46:11,210
We took it out.

2574
02:46:15,290 --> 02:46:16,350
Don't run.

2575
02:46:16,510 --> 02:46:17,390
Don't walk, man.

2576
02:46:18,250 --> 02:46:19,970
What if I...What if I skip, man?

2577
02:46:20,350 --> 02:46:21,990
What if I crawl, man?

2578
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:25,710
Yeah.

2579
02:46:27,350 --> 02:46:28,970
Die hard, man.

2580
02:46:31,690 --> 02:46:32,930
No run, man.

2581
02:46:36,850 --> 02:46:37,890
The suit!

2582
02:46:37,890 --> 02:46:37,970
Suit!

2583
02:46:40,150 --> 02:46:43,270
You are well dressed for the occasion, sir.

2584
02:46:44,770 --> 02:46:45,710
Oh my goodness.

2585
02:46:52,110 --> 02:46:53,230
East of...

2586
02:46:53,230 --> 02:46:54,770
Those guys are on the lookout.

2587
02:46:56,370 --> 02:46:57,590
He doesn't even care.

2588
02:46:58,850 --> 02:47:00,070
Wait, how did he not care?

2589
02:47:00,890 --> 02:47:01,430
Is he stupid?

2590
02:47:02,310 --> 02:47:02,910
Are you dumb?

2591
02:47:07,310 --> 02:47:09,050
Get him walking into the wall.

2592
02:47:12,990 --> 02:47:14,170
Don't put me to sleep.

2593
02:47:15,150 --> 02:47:16,190
Oh gosh, a thing.

2594
02:47:18,610 --> 02:47:19,010
Stupid.

2595
02:47:19,990 --> 02:47:21,630
I'm just gonna take these guys out.

2596
02:47:27,090 --> 02:47:28,230
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

2597
02:47:28,510 --> 02:47:28,950
Oh, please.

2598
02:47:33,790 --> 02:47:34,850
Hello, sir.

2599
02:47:46,830 --> 02:47:47,350
Sniper!

2600
02:47:47,910 --> 02:47:47,910
Sniper!

2601
02:47:48,490 --> 02:47:48,870
Sniper!

2602
02:47:49,030 --> 02:47:49,250
Sniper!

2603
02:47:52,570 --> 02:47:53,930
Can I get him?

2604
02:47:56,990 --> 02:47:57,510
Nice!

2605
02:47:57,570 --> 02:47:57,790
Nice!

2606
02:47:57,870 --> 02:47:58,150
Nice!

2607
02:47:58,570 --> 02:47:59,490
Nice headshot.

2608
02:48:00,450 --> 02:48:02,710
I think his head is behind the thing.

2609
02:48:03,090 --> 02:48:03,910
Oh, that was my fault.

2610
02:48:04,010 --> 02:48:04,350
I didn't notice.

2611
02:48:09,720 --> 02:48:10,240
Nice.

2612
02:48:10,980 --> 02:48:11,700
Good job, team.

2613
02:48:23,020 --> 02:48:24,800
The music is so cool, right?

2614
02:48:36,490 --> 02:48:38,030
Oh, there's two of them.

2615
02:48:47,740 --> 02:48:48,520
My aim.

2616
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:49,940
My bad.

2617
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:56,040
Yes!

2618
02:48:56,260 --> 02:48:56,620
Good job.

2619
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:57,620
Good job, team.

2620
02:49:06,130 --> 02:49:08,390
They take a long time to fall asleep, don't they?

2621
02:49:12,410 --> 02:49:13,450
Now he's asleep.

2622
02:49:18,430 --> 02:49:20,450
He said from where we came from, right?

2623
02:49:22,570 --> 02:49:23,050
You ready?

2624
02:49:24,810 --> 02:49:25,810
You ready, bracelet?

2625
02:49:31,990 --> 02:49:33,630
He feels asleep.

2626
02:49:42,370 --> 02:49:44,470
From what sea it came.

2627
02:49:48,830 --> 02:49:50,950
Oh it's open now.

2628
02:49:51,730 --> 02:49:53,210
What do you know?

2629
02:50:06,520 --> 02:50:07,580
Who is shooting at me?

2630
02:50:09,300 --> 02:50:10,720
What the hell was that?

2631
02:50:13,020 --> 02:50:14,440
Where did that come from?

2632
02:50:14,780 --> 02:50:15,300
Hey you!

2633
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:22,240
You son of

2634
02:50:25,720 --> 02:50:26,060
a...

2635
02:50:26,060 --> 02:50:27,800
The gate is this way.

2636
02:50:50,040 --> 02:50:51,580
Oh my gosh!

2637
02:50:51,740 --> 02:50:51,860
Wait!

2638
02:50:51,960 --> 02:50:51,960
Wait!

2639
02:50:52,100 --> 02:50:52,100
Wait!

2640
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:53,960
OK.

2641
02:50:55,440 --> 02:50:55,860
We are OK.

2642
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:06,360
I said stay down!

2643
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:09,680
I'm just going for him.

2644
02:51:22,470 --> 02:51:23,470
Stay down!

2645
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:31,260
What did I just hear?

2646
02:51:32,300 --> 02:51:34,420
Can I take a sleep for a second?

2647
02:51:36,540 --> 02:51:37,920
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

2648
02:51:38,040 --> 02:51:39,400
Yawn, yawn, yawn.

2649
02:51:39,980 --> 02:51:40,880
Yawn, yawn.

2650
02:51:40,980 --> 02:51:41,900
Yes, a little rest.

2651
02:51:42,480 --> 02:51:43,500
Just a little nap.

2652
02:51:43,820 --> 02:51:45,280
Just like the rest of these guys.

2653
02:51:53,450 --> 02:51:54,310
Tank it up.

2654
02:51:57,730 --> 02:51:58,470
Let's go!

2655
02:51:58,470 --> 02:51:58,570
Let's go!

2656
02:52:01,450 --> 02:52:03,730
Little mid-battle siesta.

2657
02:52:04,230 --> 02:52:04,850
Exactly.

2658
02:52:05,750 --> 02:52:07,670
Ya, that's what they do in Europe, you know.

2659
02:52:08,810 --> 02:52:10,210
Everybody says... Oh, hold on.

2660
02:52:11,050 --> 02:52:12,330
It's tea time.

2661
02:52:12,650 --> 02:52:15,730
That is the tea alarm sounding.

2662
02:52:20,210 --> 02:52:21,830
I hate these guys.

2663
02:52:21,930 --> 02:52:22,750
Oh nice job.

2664
02:52:23,890 --> 02:52:24,510
Wow.

2665
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:29,770
What do you mean make something to conceal myself?

2666
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:38,500
Oh shoot, I did the wrong thing.

2667
02:52:49,320 --> 02:52:49,940
Ya!

2668
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:57,060
What you got?

2669
02:52:57,700 --> 02:52:59,640
Like a cardboard box?

2670
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:02,480
I do have something of the sort.

2671
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:09,140
Oh wait, that thing is still up.

2672
02:53:17,690 --> 02:53:18,730
What are you shooting at?

2673
02:53:31,310 --> 02:53:35,530
I could have sworn I equipped the rescue box, but I don't think I did.

2674
02:53:35,910 --> 02:53:36,890
Because I'm silly.

2675
02:53:42,460 --> 02:53:43,420
Holy cow!

2676
02:53:46,420 --> 02:53:49,880
Oh my gosh, I equipped the ration just at the right time.

2677
02:53:55,550 --> 02:53:56,150
You!

2678
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:00,200
Don't.

2679
02:54:00,260 --> 02:54:01,180
Do not fire that.

2680
02:54:01,380 --> 02:54:04,720
Do not fire that.

2681
02:54:05,060 --> 02:54:06,540
In front of my face.

2682
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:11,480
No!

2683
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:15,660
No!

2684
02:54:16,140 --> 02:54:16,380
No!

2685
02:54:19,220 --> 02:54:19,660
Bracelet!

2686
02:54:19,860 --> 02:54:20,460
I got you!

2687
02:54:20,840 --> 02:54:21,360
Hold on.

2688
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:22,380
I will have you.

2689
02:54:22,760 --> 02:54:23,260
In a second.

2690
02:54:32,740 --> 02:54:32,920
What?

2691
02:54:33,100 --> 02:54:33,140
What?

2692
02:54:33,340 --> 02:54:33,480
What?

2693
02:54:33,700 --> 02:54:33,900
What?

2694
02:54:34,380 --> 02:54:34,500
What?

2695
02:54:34,700 --> 02:54:34,900
What?

2696
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:35,460
What?

2697
02:54:35,600 --> 02:54:35,600
What?

2698
02:54:35,720 --> 02:54:35,920
What?

2699
02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:37,800
Europe.

2700
02:54:38,200 --> 02:54:38,900
Europe buddy.

2701
02:54:39,240 --> 02:54:39,760
Europe buddy.

2702
02:54:42,700 --> 02:54:43,820
Watch out behind you!

2703
02:54:44,020 --> 02:54:44,620
Behind you!

2704
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:48,320
I'm gonna take a siesta.

2705
02:54:48,320 --> 02:54:48,460
Siesta.

2706
02:54:57,400 --> 02:54:59,280
I'm out of rations, you're right.

2707
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:02,240
Are we gonna be OK?

2708
02:55:04,780 --> 02:55:05,780
Should we take him?

2709
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:06,060
Oh.

2710
02:55:07,160 --> 02:55:07,560
No.

2711
02:55:10,330 --> 02:55:11,410
I got some S curry.

2712
02:55:17,550 --> 02:55:18,730
Oh sorry, my bad.

2713
02:55:19,150 --> 02:55:20,630
I was gonna get this guy.

2714
02:55:28,970 --> 02:55:30,210
Do you have enough stuff?

2715
02:55:30,730 --> 02:55:31,410
Grab your things!

2716
02:55:31,530 --> 02:55:32,070
Grab your things!

2717
02:55:32,190 --> 02:55:32,790
Grab your things!

2718
02:55:33,810 --> 02:55:34,170
Ouch!

2719
02:55:36,430 --> 02:55:39,630
Wait, do I have... I don't.

2720
02:55:39,730 --> 02:55:40,430
I didn't bring it.

2721
02:55:40,510 --> 02:55:41,890
I didn't bring my own strike thing.

2722
02:55:42,510 --> 02:55:42,930
Or whatever.

2723
02:55:44,130 --> 02:55:44,910
I'm gonna take that.

2724
02:55:45,270 --> 02:55:45,890
Alright, come on!

2725
02:55:47,550 --> 02:55:48,670
Oh wait, does he have anything?

2726
02:55:50,850 --> 02:55:51,790
I missed my chance.

2727
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:51,990
Wait.

2728
02:55:53,250 --> 02:55:54,110
I missed my chance.

2729
02:55:54,530 --> 02:55:55,230
I missed my chance.

2730
02:55:55,670 --> 02:55:56,450
OK, that's fine.

2731
02:55:56,630 --> 02:55:57,110
Let's just go.

2732
02:56:10,170 --> 02:56:11,350
That could have been cleaner.

2733
02:56:13,110 --> 02:56:15,370
That could have been cleaner maybe.

2734
02:56:19,700 --> 02:56:20,760
A little bit better.

2735
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:24,100
Run for it!

2736
02:56:24,260 --> 02:56:24,500
Run!

2737
02:56:25,140 --> 02:56:25,380
Run!

2738
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:25,680
Run!

2739
02:56:25,900 --> 02:56:26,060
Run!

2740
02:56:26,060 --> 02:56:26,180
Run!

2741
02:56:26,920 --> 02:56:26,920
Run!

2742
02:56:26,940 --> 02:56:27,120
Run!

2743
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:27,300
Run!

2744
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:35,180
Don't die on me!

2745
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:36,020
Don't die on me!

2746
02:56:40,340 --> 02:56:41,440
Don't die on me!

2747
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:50,840
You son of a bitch.

2748
02:57:00,040 --> 02:57:01,940
I'm using the action button!

2749
02:57:03,580 --> 02:57:04,280
Wait.

2750
02:57:04,520 --> 02:57:04,880
Action.

2751
02:57:05,580 --> 02:57:06,200
Action button?

2752
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:07,580
What?

2753
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:08,560
Where's the action button?

2754
02:57:10,100 --> 02:57:11,640
Oh, we're already through it.

2755
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:14,880
We're already through it, guys.

2756
02:57:15,820 --> 02:57:17,540
It's like the wrong thing.

2757
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:21,560
What a dumbo.

2758
02:57:32,140 --> 02:57:34,420
Hives are such a drama queen.

2759
02:57:36,140 --> 02:57:37,340
Heliport time!

2760
02:57:38,260 --> 02:57:38,580
OK.

2761
02:57:39,460 --> 02:57:40,700
A bit late on the advice.

2762
02:57:40,760 --> 02:57:41,720
He stressed me out.

2763
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:45,720
He stressed me out.

2764
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,900
Let's get to top health and be in tip-top shape.

2765
02:57:53,620 --> 02:57:54,920
We're almost there.

2766
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:56,760
So close.

2767
02:57:57,320 --> 02:57:58,240
We're safe.

2768
02:57:58,740 --> 02:57:59,840
We're gonna be all good.

2769
02:58:00,680 --> 02:58:01,240
Alrighty.

2770
02:58:02,020 --> 02:58:03,020
Action button.

2771
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:06,360
I'm sick of the action, guys.

2772
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:09,060
I just want to lay here and become one with the earth.

2773
02:58:09,720 --> 02:58:11,400
I want to become a worm!

2774
02:58:12,960 --> 02:58:13,660
OK, I'm good.

2775
02:58:13,780 --> 02:58:14,100
Let's go.

2776
02:58:26,650 --> 02:58:27,210
Maybe.

2777
02:58:27,210 --> 02:58:27,770
Close.

2778
02:58:28,470 --> 02:58:28,990
Maybe.

2779
02:58:29,570 --> 02:58:30,110
Almost.

2780
02:58:30,390 --> 02:58:30,890
Yes.

2781
02:58:36,190 --> 02:58:37,570
Watch out for the gunship.

2782
02:58:39,830 --> 02:58:40,310
Oh yes.

2783
02:58:40,510 --> 02:58:41,410
Oh my god.

2784
02:58:41,470 --> 02:58:42,690
Yes, this is 100%.

2785
02:58:50,200 --> 02:58:51,440
I'm getting to the thing.

2786
02:58:51,540 --> 02:58:52,440
There's nowhere to run.

2787
02:58:52,680 --> 02:58:54,200
You've got to take those guys down.

2788
02:59:05,400 --> 02:59:06,620
That was close.

2789
02:59:08,880 --> 02:59:09,320
Aim.

2790
02:59:09,360 --> 02:59:09,640
Don't go.

2791
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:11,760
Violence!

2792
02:59:16,500 --> 02:59:17,180
No!

2793
02:59:18,280 --> 02:59:19,840
I don't need!

2794
02:59:29,820 --> 02:59:30,500
Violence!

2795
02:59:31,100 --> 02:59:31,500
Violence!

2796
02:59:34,340 --> 02:59:36,020
What do you mean?

2797
02:59:38,840 --> 02:59:39,440
OK.

2798
02:59:44,940 --> 02:59:46,300
Violence!

2799
02:59:49,560 --> 02:59:50,700
Where's the chopper?

2800
02:59:52,480 --> 02:59:53,680
Oh my god, Kaz.

2801
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:54,280
Give me a second.

2802
02:59:54,420 --> 02:59:55,280
I was just looking.

2803
02:59:55,600 --> 03:00:02,220
How am I supposed to take care of a chopper if I can't go outside, Kaz?

2804
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:46,000
Are you OK?

2805
03:00:46,860 --> 03:00:47,520
You're fine.

2806
03:00:47,520 --> 03:00:48,060
Go!

2807
03:00:48,060 --> 03:00:48,640
Go!

2808
03:00:48,640 --> 03:00:49,540
Ow.

2809
03:00:57,860 --> 03:01:00,440
Come on.

2810
03:01:22,780 --> 03:01:24,180
What's

2811
03:01:27,370 --> 03:01:28,770
that?

2812
03:01:30,630 --> 03:01:31,030
Nice.

2813
03:01:33,490 --> 03:01:34,410
Where did he go?

2814
03:01:34,710 --> 03:01:35,270
There he is.

2815
03:01:36,930 --> 03:01:37,870
Oh, I missed.

2816
03:01:40,630 --> 03:01:41,190
We'll

2817
03:01:46,590 --> 03:01:48,070
wait for the chorus to pick up.

2818
03:01:56,220 --> 03:01:56,780
Peace!

2819
03:01:58,740 --> 03:01:59,300
Peace!

2820
03:02:02,820 --> 03:02:03,380
Peace!

2821
03:02:16,400 --> 03:02:17,460
Peace!

2822
03:02:48,020 --> 03:02:48,560
I'm

2823
03:02:55,690 --> 03:02:56,410
almost out of ammo!

2824
03:03:00,590 --> 03:03:01,690
I'm out of ammo!

2825
03:03:02,490 --> 03:03:02,970
Bracelet!

2826
03:03:03,330 --> 03:03:04,290
You can do it!

2827
03:03:04,630 --> 03:03:05,710
You can do it!

2828
03:03:09,910 --> 03:03:11,330
Oh my gosh, we got it twice.

2829
03:03:11,390 --> 03:03:11,850
Let's go.

2830
03:03:27,950 --> 03:03:28,750
I'll take him.

2831
03:03:29,070 --> 03:03:30,030
I'll take him home.

2832
03:03:33,410 --> 03:03:33,570
Peace.

2833
03:03:33,850 --> 03:03:34,330
My bad.

2834
03:03:35,770 --> 03:03:36,250
Hey!

2835
03:03:37,410 --> 03:03:37,890
Hey!

2836
03:03:38,730 --> 03:03:38,950
Hey!

2837
03:03:39,090 --> 03:03:39,390
Hey!

2838
03:03:39,550 --> 03:03:39,930
Watch out!

2839
03:03:40,390 --> 03:03:41,290
You're money hungry.

2840
03:03:41,510 --> 03:03:41,970
You're hungry.

2841
03:03:42,270 --> 03:03:43,290
You're too hungry for violence.

2842
03:03:46,510 --> 03:03:48,250
I'll take you home too.

2843
03:03:48,690 --> 03:03:50,330
I'll save you!

2844
03:03:53,050 --> 03:03:54,010
Let's go.

2845
03:04:03,970 --> 03:04:06,150
I have a support!

2846
03:04:10,250 --> 03:04:11,930
So beautiful.

2847
03:04:15,410 --> 03:04:17,450
I love this game.

2848
03:04:18,490 --> 03:04:19,410
For peace!

2849
03:04:19,490 --> 03:04:19,970
For peace!

2850
03:04:20,050 --> 03:04:20,770
For peace!

2851
03:04:24,900 --> 03:04:25,740
Pause!

2852
03:04:27,940 --> 03:04:28,480
Oh my god.

2853
03:04:29,640 --> 03:04:31,500
Peak incoming, you guys.

2854
03:04:33,780 --> 03:04:34,620
Peak incoming.

2855
03:05:01,900 --> 03:05:02,500
Retaliate.

2856
03:05:02,780 --> 03:05:05,520
This is so messed up.

2857
03:05:05,660 --> 03:05:06,680
This is so backwards.

2858
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:18,440
He is so stupid.

2859
03:05:19,960 --> 03:05:29,040
We have reverse engineered the false data so that she'll inevitably end up choosing the Caribbean Sea as her target.

2860
03:05:29,520 --> 03:05:31,620
You're really gonna do it, aren't you?

2861
03:05:32,180 --> 03:05:32,920
Know this.

2862
03:05:33,500 --> 03:05:39,540
Peace Walker's retaliation will be the first and last of the Cold War.

2863
03:05:40,160 --> 03:05:45,820
It is the only way we will ever come close to achieving true peace.

2864
03:05:46,020 --> 03:05:46,380
What?

2865
03:05:46,380 --> 03:05:49,920
All that is left is to enter the cold.

2866
03:05:51,500 --> 03:05:51,720
No!

2867
03:05:57,060 --> 03:05:58,980
You're late.

2868
03:06:00,620 --> 03:06:01,920
Uh oh.

2869
03:06:15,640 --> 03:06:17,080
No way.

2870
03:06:17,080 --> 03:06:19,420
We have a double crosser in our boots.

2871
03:06:32,300 --> 03:06:34,500
Oh my god.

2872
03:06:36,080 --> 03:06:37,080
Professor...what's his name?

2873
03:06:37,240 --> 03:06:37,620
Galvez?

2874
03:06:44,420 --> 03:06:46,700
Yeah, I only know him as a doorknob.

2875
03:07:00,620 --> 03:07:03,300
The world will burn with anti-American sentiment.

2876
03:07:03,620 --> 03:07:06,900
Communism will spread across Latin America unchecked.

2877
03:07:06,920 --> 03:07:12,540
Let the age of deterrence be undone by the deterrent itself.

2878
03:07:13,240 --> 03:07:15,340
Such is the Kremlin's plan.

2879
03:07:15,960 --> 03:07:17,600
You son of a bitch!

2880
03:07:18,020 --> 03:07:19,800
Thanks for letting me join the mission.

2881
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:22,880
You...

2882
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:24,920
No!

2883
03:07:25,820 --> 03:07:27,200
You were so great.

2884
03:07:27,300 --> 03:07:28,020
Thank you for joining.

2885
03:07:28,020 --> 03:07:31,720
I am Vladimir Zadornov.

2886
03:07:33,200 --> 03:07:34,320
ZADORNOV!

2887
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:40,680
The doorknob!

2888
03:07:42,220 --> 03:07:42,660
No!

2889
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:46,200
No!

2890
03:07:50,540 --> 03:07:50,740
No!

2891
03:07:52,940 --> 03:07:54,160
Paz, don't do it.

2892
03:07:54,780 --> 03:07:55,300
Or you could.

2893
03:07:55,560 --> 03:07:56,020
Whatever.

2894
03:07:58,020 --> 03:07:58,780
I'm sorry.

2895
03:08:01,120 --> 03:08:02,920
This guy is such a weenie.

2896
03:08:03,100 --> 03:08:04,320
The absolute weenie.

2897
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:16,480
Oof.

2898
03:08:16,480 --> 03:08:17,280
Ouchie ouch.

2899
03:08:18,080 --> 03:08:18,820
Oof my bones.

2900
03:08:19,740 --> 03:08:20,380
Oof.

2901
03:08:20,580 --> 03:08:21,840
Ouchie ouch my bones.

2902
03:08:28,790 --> 03:08:30,540
Your part in this isn't done.

2903
03:08:30,980 --> 03:08:32,740
I need you to enter the code.

2904
03:08:36,520 --> 03:08:38,860
Doctor, the target is now Cuba.

2905
03:08:39,280 --> 03:08:40,980
Please make the necessary modifications.

2906
03:08:44,730 --> 03:08:46,740
And don't even think of resisting.

2907
03:08:47,560 --> 03:08:52,400
I'll crush you, but only after I crush your beloved first.

2908
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:54,320
So rude.

2909
03:08:54,320 --> 03:08:54,860
No!

2910
03:08:56,240 --> 03:08:57,420
Not that!

2911
03:08:58,040 --> 03:09:00,200
Cuba is now the retaliation target.

2912
03:09:02,300 --> 03:09:03,380
Very well.

2913
03:09:04,500 --> 03:09:04,940
Good.

2914
03:09:05,400 --> 03:09:05,900
It is done.

2915
03:09:06,540 --> 03:09:11,140
As for you, big boss... I've been watching you all along.

2916
03:09:11,620 --> 03:09:14,880
You've performed beyond even my highest expectations.

2917
03:09:15,340 --> 03:09:16,580
A true commandante.

2918
03:09:16,880 --> 03:09:18,120
What are you talking about?

2919
03:09:18,260 --> 03:09:19,260
Yeah, I'm good at the game.

2920
03:09:19,260 --> 03:09:21,940
Why do you think I summoned you to Costa Rica?

2921
03:09:22,360 --> 03:09:24,300
Had you made contact with the Sandinistas?

2922
03:09:25,140 --> 03:09:28,900
A true intelligence operative never gets his hands dirty.

2923
03:09:29,620 --> 03:09:30,240
Need a revolution?

2924
03:09:30,800 --> 03:09:32,840
Manipulate the locals into doing it for you.

2925
03:09:33,140 --> 03:09:33,820
Commandante?

2926
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:37,120
I mean Amanda and the Sandinistas.

2927
03:09:37,340 --> 03:09:38,720
You've done well.

2928
03:09:39,360 --> 03:09:47,640
You took a ragtag band of gorillas, children, and shaped them into a full-fledged formidable army.

2929
03:09:48,780 --> 03:09:50,520
My boss is good at that.

2930
03:09:50,520 --> 03:09:52,920
Taking children and making them into an army.

2931
03:09:53,480 --> 03:09:54,980
Wait, is this foreshadowing?

2932
03:09:56,320 --> 03:09:57,220
None other.

2933
03:09:57,820 --> 03:10:02,600
A hero who, gunned down by the CIA, becomes a legendary icon.

2934
03:10:04,360 --> 03:10:10,720
The Sandinistas will rise up in revenge, overthrowing the pro-American regime and wresting Nicaragua from U.S.

2935
03:10:10,800 --> 03:10:11,160
hands.

2936
03:10:11,420 --> 03:10:14,900
And the nuclear strike on Cuba, naturally, will be the last straw.

2937
03:10:16,620 --> 03:10:18,480
Mammal pod data entry is complete.

2938
03:10:19,340 --> 03:10:21,060
Dead at age 39.

2939
03:10:21,780 --> 03:10:23,000
Just like El Che.

2940
03:10:25,760 --> 03:10:26,940
Ironic, isn't it?

2941
03:10:29,330 --> 03:10:30,850
A legend is merely fiction.

2942
03:10:31,570 --> 03:10:35,910
You'll die as the boss did, and become as did she, an eternal fraud.

2943
03:10:38,890 --> 03:10:39,490
Go!

2944
03:10:41,050 --> 03:10:41,050
Go!

2945
03:10:41,190 --> 03:10:41,390
Go!

2946
03:10:41,510 --> 03:10:42,070
Yeah!

2947
03:10:42,070 --> 03:10:42,250
Yeah!

2948
03:10:45,270 --> 03:10:45,990
We'll win!

2949
03:10:46,590 --> 03:10:47,170
We'll win!

2950
03:10:56,010 --> 03:10:56,710
Freeze!

2951
03:10:57,880 --> 03:10:59,650
You dare point your gun at a comrade?

2952
03:11:00,290 --> 03:11:03,030
We will not be pawns of the KGB.

2953
03:11:03,710 --> 03:11:06,170
We will win our own victory!

2954
03:11:06,890 --> 03:11:08,370
Hasta la victoria siempre!

2955
03:11:09,730 --> 03:11:10,190
Amanda!

2956
03:11:10,910 --> 03:11:11,690
Vic, boss!

2957
03:11:12,070 --> 03:11:12,790
We're home!

2958
03:11:13,150 --> 03:11:13,410
Look!

2959
03:11:13,870 --> 03:11:14,850
We're back in Nica!

2960
03:11:16,570 --> 03:11:17,850
We did it, Amanda!

2961
03:11:18,110 --> 03:11:19,090
I mean...

2962
03:11:20,090 --> 03:11:20,710
Comandante!

2963
03:11:21,050 --> 03:11:21,670
Comandante!

2964
03:11:24,820 --> 03:11:25,650
Boss, you hurt.

2965
03:11:26,770 --> 03:11:27,390
Comandante?

2966
03:11:31,050 --> 03:11:32,270
Vic, boss!

2967
03:11:32,490 --> 03:11:33,310
Vic, boss!

2968
03:11:33,790 --> 03:11:34,110
Vic, boss!

2969
03:11:34,410 --> 03:11:35,030
Vic, boss!

2970
03:11:35,670 --> 03:11:36,710
Vic, boss!

2971
03:11:36,770 --> 03:11:37,530
Vic, boss!

2972
03:11:38,090 --> 03:11:39,150
Vic, boss!

2973
03:11:39,430 --> 03:11:40,330
Vic, boss!

2974
03:11:40,530 --> 03:11:41,610
Vic, boss!

2975
03:11:41,610 --> 03:11:42,790
Vic, boss!

2976
03:11:42,950 --> 03:11:43,890
Vic, boss!

2977
03:11:44,010 --> 03:11:45,110
Vic, boss!

2978
03:11:45,190 --> 03:11:46,250
Vic, boss!

2979
03:11:46,470 --> 03:11:47,390
Vic, boss!

2980
03:11:47,510 --> 03:11:47,510
Vic, boss!

2981
03:11:47,510 --> 03:11:49,010
You're regular Joan of Arc.

2982
03:11:49,750 --> 03:11:50,350
Nonsense.

2983
03:11:50,910 --> 03:11:52,010
You're the hero here.

2984
03:11:52,770 --> 03:11:54,350
You saved my life.

2985
03:11:54,930 --> 03:11:56,130
You're the heroes here.

2986
03:11:56,970 --> 03:11:57,810
Vic, boss!

2987
03:11:57,930 --> 03:11:58,610
Vic, boss!

2988
03:11:58,610 --> 03:12:00,870
I never figured you for a softie, Snake.

2989
03:12:02,290 --> 03:12:02,890
Thanks.

2990
03:12:03,470 --> 03:12:04,610
It's good to see you.

2991
03:12:08,070 --> 03:12:09,990
Ahhhhhhhhh Vic, boss!

2992
03:12:10,030 --> 03:12:11,070
Vic, boss!

2993
03:12:11,210 --> 03:12:12,270
Vic, boss!

2994
03:12:12,510 --> 03:12:13,470
Vic, boss!

2995
03:12:20,430 --> 03:12:24,050
Boss can stay with us until she's back on her feet.

2996
03:12:24,270 --> 03:12:25,110
And the professor?

2997
03:12:25,650 --> 03:12:27,170
We'll find him a nice, comfy cell.

2998
03:12:27,650 --> 03:12:29,010
Goldman has lost a lot of blood.

2999
03:12:29,250 --> 03:12:30,510
He may not make it...

3000
03:12:31,050 --> 03:12:32,050
Where is Amanda?

3001
03:12:32,430 --> 03:12:33,310
Back with her compa.

3002
03:12:33,530 --> 03:12:34,690
She will catch up later.

3003
03:12:34,690 --> 03:12:38,350
And nobody was sad about that.

3004
03:13:07,300 --> 03:13:09,020
I wanted to know how she really felt.

3005
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:11,180
How it really ended.

3006
03:13:12,580 --> 03:13:13,500
The boss is dead.

3007
03:13:13,960 --> 03:13:15,920
No, she's alive.

3008
03:13:16,580 --> 03:13:18,800
Some truths are better left buried.

3009
03:13:19,240 --> 03:13:20,260
You don't mean that.

3010
03:13:21,020 --> 03:13:23,800
Be honest, you want to know too, don't you?

3011
03:13:25,120 --> 03:13:28,100
Whether what she saw and heard at the end was the truth.

3012
03:13:29,660 --> 03:13:30,820
She'll tell us.

3013
03:13:32,040 --> 03:13:32,960
I know she will.

3014
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:38,580
Thank you for stopping them.

3015
03:13:40,200 --> 03:13:41,600
And I'm sorry.

3016
03:13:42,780 --> 03:13:44,480
I can't imagine how it hurt.

3017
03:13:45,400 --> 03:13:45,960
I'll live.

3018
03:13:46,520 --> 03:13:47,680
I'm used to shark therapy.

3019
03:13:48,280 --> 03:13:48,760
You are?

3020
03:13:48,900 --> 03:13:50,100
Strange love is a trucker.

3021
03:13:50,960 --> 03:13:53,340
I miss the heaven's divide, unfortunately.

3022
03:13:54,540 --> 03:13:55,820
Let's go meet her, shall we?

3023
03:13:56,740 --> 03:13:57,260
Get in.

3024
03:13:58,140 --> 03:13:58,540
Boss.

3025
03:13:59,360 --> 03:13:59,840
Boss.

3026
03:14:04,280 --> 03:14:06,980
Don't pick up a gun unless you know how to use it.

3027
03:14:06,980 --> 03:14:08,380
She didn't.

3028
03:14:08,540 --> 03:14:09,660
It wasn't her fault.

3029
03:14:09,860 --> 03:14:12,460
Aiming a weapon alone doesn't make it a deterrent.

3030
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:12,920
Cause!

3031
03:14:13,300 --> 03:14:14,780
She was forced to.

3032
03:14:15,140 --> 03:14:15,800
Shut up.

3033
03:14:16,980 --> 03:14:18,560
You're the angel of peace.

3034
03:14:19,100 --> 03:14:20,680
Leave the guns to us.

3035
03:14:20,960 --> 03:14:21,660
My baby.

3036
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:23,460
Don't cry, little princess.

3037
03:14:25,740 --> 03:14:27,460
That was our agreement, remember?

3038
03:14:28,340 --> 03:14:30,480
The army is leaving Costa Rica now.

3039
03:14:31,480 --> 03:14:32,520
The mission is complete.

3040
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:34,540
Paz?

3041
03:14:36,420 --> 03:14:38,000
I love this picture too.

3042
03:14:39,140 --> 03:14:40,100
Thank you.

3043
03:14:42,200 --> 03:14:43,840
I love you so much.

3044
03:14:43,940 --> 03:14:45,980
Also, why did we not...

3045
03:14:45,980 --> 03:14:47,660
Oh my god, this stupid...

3046
03:14:47,660 --> 03:14:50,520
This is the dumbest part, I think, of the whole game.

3047
03:14:54,060 --> 03:14:55,720
Somebody stop him!

3048
03:15:04,020 --> 03:15:05,220
Somebody do something!

3049
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:06,780
Somebody do something!

3050
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:16,140
That's so stupid!

3051
03:15:17,860 --> 03:15:19,760
Oh my god!

3052
03:15:23,720 --> 03:15:26,080
Somebody do something!

3053
03:15:32,940 --> 03:15:34,540
Oh my god!

3054
03:15:39,620 --> 03:15:40,260
What?

3055
03:15:40,340 --> 03:15:42,440
The guy is supposed to be dead.

3056
03:15:55,160 --> 03:15:57,200
He is such a cockroach.

3057
03:15:58,060 --> 03:15:59,440
Oh my god.

3058
03:16:00,500 --> 03:16:02,340
One last gacha pull.

3059
03:16:07,700 --> 03:16:11,400
I thought you had him.

3060
03:16:11,680 --> 03:16:13,020
No, I thought you had him.

3061
03:16:18,740 --> 03:16:19,860
Uh oh.

3062
03:16:21,340 --> 03:16:22,340
The milk signal.

3063
03:16:23,240 --> 03:16:23,480
Signal.

3064
03:16:25,240 --> 03:16:26,780
I didn't even catch that.

3065
03:16:26,840 --> 03:16:27,260
Oh my god.

3066
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:37,000
Oh my god.

3067
03:16:38,600 --> 03:16:39,400
No!

3068
03:16:58,960 --> 03:17:00,800
Lord B.B.

3069
03:17:00,900 --> 03:17:01,220
and John.

3070
03:17:04,400 --> 03:17:06,380
No, it's no rap.

3071
03:17:06,440 --> 03:17:07,880
They track Santa Claus.

3072
03:17:10,160 --> 03:17:12,320
This guy is so stupid!

3073
03:17:12,800 --> 03:17:13,660
This guy is so dumb.

3074
03:17:31,220 --> 03:17:34,460
No one among them has the courage to push the button.

3075
03:17:35,660 --> 03:17:39,980
No one willing to enter history as the great destroyer.

3076
03:17:41,940 --> 03:17:46,680
In the end, it's not their lives that people value most.

3077
03:17:47,940 --> 03:17:49,640
It's their reputations.

3078
03:17:50,940 --> 03:17:54,780
The bureaucrats in Washington may not be able to retaliate.

3079
03:17:55,240 --> 03:17:57,360
He is so stupid.

3080
03:17:57,360 --> 03:17:59,160
They made a milk signal.

3081
03:17:59,560 --> 03:18:00,580
I am ready for death.

3082
03:18:08,120 --> 03:18:10,360
Why is he making that face?

3083
03:18:19,540 --> 03:18:20,580
You gotta...

3084
03:18:20,580 --> 03:18:22,920
You gotta break the eggs to make an omelette.

3085
03:18:23,380 --> 03:18:23,620
Right?

3086
03:18:27,360 --> 03:18:28,040
Are you insane?

3087
03:18:28,380 --> 03:18:29,360
You think it will end there?

3088
03:18:29,800 --> 03:18:32,520
You're about to unleash all out nuclear war.

3089
03:18:32,720 --> 03:18:34,560
I need to find out what's going on at NORAD.

3090
03:18:34,820 --> 03:18:36,600
Mammals got a connection to NORAD.

3091
03:18:36,840 --> 03:18:38,600
We can monitor it with the right equipment.

3092
03:18:39,380 --> 03:18:40,180
I've got you covered.

3093
03:18:41,760 --> 03:18:42,200
Huey!

3094
03:18:42,340 --> 03:18:43,380
Huey doing something good for once.

3095
03:18:43,380 --> 03:18:44,280
I've got NORAD on the line.

3096
03:18:44,680 --> 03:18:46,200
Sir, we're tracking unidentified targets.

3097
03:18:46,440 --> 03:18:47,220
Current Apogee 20 degrees.

3098
03:18:47,220 --> 03:18:47,720
No, here we go!

3099
03:18:48,780 --> 03:18:51,440
He's been awfully quiet this whole time, hasn't he?

3100
03:18:51,460 --> 03:18:51,940
I've contacted the president.

3101
03:18:52,140 --> 03:18:53,160
Coverall is not responding.

3102
03:18:53,160 --> 03:18:54,220
Reporting system checks out.

3103
03:18:54,360 --> 03:18:55,820
No corresponding natural signatures.

3104
03:18:56,220 --> 03:18:57,320
Data is assessed as reliable.

3105
03:18:57,540 --> 03:18:58,420
Cut the data transmission.

3106
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:01,400
We can't say for sure Washington isn't going to retaliate.

3107
03:19:02,060 --> 03:19:05,060
The only one who knows the abort code is me.

3108
03:19:05,060 --> 03:19:06,760
This guy sucks so much.

3109
03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:13,000
I die and no one can turn it off.

3110
03:19:13,720 --> 03:19:19,260
Even if they do strike back, I'll already be dead.

3111
03:19:19,260 --> 03:19:28,320
I can only pray that my theory... my peace... is proven right.

3112
03:19:38,460 --> 03:19:40,200
Go to DEFCON 3.

3113
03:19:40,440 --> 03:19:41,540
Get Zack on the throne.

3114
03:19:41,700 --> 03:19:42,580
This is Crystal Palace.

3115
03:19:42,860 --> 03:19:44,220
Stand by for an emergency meeting.

3116
03:19:44,320 --> 03:19:45,400
They're at DEFCON 3.

3117
03:19:45,520 --> 03:19:48,340
The false data and the nukes are both coming from the same source.

3118
03:19:48,660 --> 03:19:50,080
We have to stop Peace Walker.

3119
03:19:50,220 --> 03:19:52,120
The only way is to destroy him.

3120
03:19:55,580 --> 03:19:57,220
She's entered launch mode.

3121
03:19:57,860 --> 03:19:59,300
Peace Walker has rendered her judgment.

3122
03:20:00,220 --> 03:20:02,080
The target is Cuba.

3123
03:20:02,100 --> 03:20:02,680
You guys ready?

3124
03:20:05,540 --> 03:20:06,540
Big mission!

3125
03:20:06,680 --> 03:20:07,200
Big mission!

3126
03:20:09,460 --> 03:20:10,400
Big mission.

3127
03:20:10,500 --> 03:20:11,500
Big mission.

3128
03:20:12,080 --> 03:20:12,940
P killed him.

3129
03:20:13,580 --> 03:20:15,300
I thought of P and died.

3130
03:20:18,680 --> 03:20:21,220
Maybe that's why it happened to you guys.

3131
03:20:27,040 --> 03:20:28,840
Peace Walker!

3132
03:20:30,320 --> 03:20:31,560
Peace Crawler.

3133
03:20:35,800 --> 03:20:37,420
He peaced out.

3134
03:20:39,480 --> 03:20:42,000
He's such a stinky guy.

3135
03:20:48,540 --> 03:20:50,860
It's calculating ballistic trajectory.

3136
03:20:51,500 --> 03:20:54,020
Once that's finished, it's all over.

3137
03:20:54,720 --> 03:20:57,100
Snake, you've got to destroy the platform.

3138
03:20:58,140 --> 03:21:00,600
In the next episode!

3139
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:02,080
Yeah!

3140
03:21:03,660 --> 03:21:06,820
You guys ready for a big bang finale?

3141
03:21:11,520 --> 03:21:12,960
Launching SMILE!

3142
03:21:18,140 --> 03:21:20,900
We didn't do so hot in that one, but that's OK!

3143
03:21:20,900 --> 03:21:22,880
Dull Bracelet, you were great!

3144
03:21:23,440 --> 03:21:24,540
You were so awesome.

3145
03:21:24,780 --> 03:21:25,460
Thank you!

3146
03:21:25,560 --> 03:21:27,340
Thanks for also letting the song play.

3147
03:21:27,560 --> 03:21:28,520
You did perfect.

3148
03:21:28,680 --> 03:21:29,940
You did everything so well.

3149
03:21:30,300 --> 03:21:30,600
Thank you!

3150
03:21:30,840 --> 03:21:31,200
Thank you!

3151
03:21:38,460 --> 03:21:40,020
It was awesome.

3152
03:21:41,480 --> 03:21:42,720
It felt so good.

3153
03:21:44,800 --> 03:21:48,420
Let's sort our men again and then we'll go into the last mission.

3154
03:21:53,900 --> 03:21:57,560
Oh yeah, that's the guy that got rhinoceros.

3155
03:21:57,660 --> 03:21:59,820
We took a couple.

3156
03:22:02,460 --> 03:22:03,140
Let's see.

3157
03:22:03,940 --> 03:22:04,700
Horse!

3158
03:22:04,980 --> 03:22:05,540
Wow!

3159
03:22:05,720 --> 03:22:08,220
Horses are really good in R&D.

3160
03:22:09,360 --> 03:22:09,920
Let's see.

3161
03:22:10,480 --> 03:22:11,280
Let's get...wait.

3162
03:22:14,700 --> 03:22:20,160
We will replace horse with another horse.

3163
03:22:21,000 --> 03:22:22,740
So we finish today?

3164
03:22:23,860 --> 03:22:24,640
You'll see.

3165
03:22:27,260 --> 03:22:31,140
We replace one Hans with another Hans.

3166
03:22:31,240 --> 03:22:32,960
I think this guy can actually like it.

3167
03:22:34,060 --> 03:22:35,880
I think we can actually discharge him.

3168
03:22:39,060 --> 03:22:40,480
So scary.

3169
03:22:43,060 --> 03:22:44,640
Oh whoops, my bad.

3170
03:22:47,820 --> 03:22:48,660
Nice!

3171
03:22:49,640 --> 03:22:50,460
You're fired.

3172
03:22:53,630 --> 03:22:54,670
Let's see.

3173
03:22:56,190 --> 03:22:57,510
Marine Iguana.

3174
03:22:58,710 --> 03:22:59,910
You're not very good either.

3175
03:23:00,110 --> 03:23:00,410
Sorry.

3176
03:23:03,370 --> 03:23:04,730
You're fired.

3177
03:23:05,010 --> 03:23:05,990
Oh, I keep doing that.

3178
03:23:06,070 --> 03:23:06,610
Sorry, my bad.

3179
03:23:08,390 --> 03:23:10,410
We want better weapons and things.

3180
03:23:10,850 --> 03:23:12,950
We're picky now everybody.

3181
03:23:13,850 --> 03:23:16,730
Mother Base is only so big.

3182
03:23:17,890 --> 03:23:21,190
We need all the good stuff that we can get.

3183
03:23:24,610 --> 03:23:25,770
Well team.

3184
03:23:27,870 --> 03:23:30,410
It's been an honor fighting with you all.

3185
03:23:32,350 --> 03:23:34,830
It's been an honor fighting with you all.

3186
03:23:35,570 --> 03:23:37,470
Peace Walker battle number two.

3187
03:23:39,030 --> 03:23:41,810
Snake, don't let it launch the nuke.

3188
03:23:42,310 --> 03:23:46,090
I feel like Kaz has said this like 50 different times.

3189
03:23:47,090 --> 03:23:49,450
Don't let Peace Walker launch the nuke.

3190
03:23:54,670 --> 03:23:57,350
And I am creating the room now.

3191
03:24:03,580 --> 03:24:04,300
Arisaka.

3192
03:24:05,180 --> 03:24:05,820
Rooks.

3193
03:24:06,800 --> 03:24:11,000
And Silver Hida.

3194
03:24:11,460 --> 03:24:11,760
Welcome.

3195
03:24:13,780 --> 03:24:14,260
Welcome.

3196
03:24:14,440 --> 03:24:16,040
Wow we are international today.

3197
03:24:16,120 --> 03:24:16,580
Let's go.

3198
03:24:17,280 --> 03:24:19,180
And as you know...

3199
03:24:19,180 --> 03:24:20,880
For any fight...

3200
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:22,560
Exactly!

3201
03:24:28,790 --> 03:24:30,910
We got... Oh see I have the rescue box.

3202
03:24:31,970 --> 03:24:33,130
What is that one?

3203
03:24:33,770 --> 03:24:34,910
I missed it.

3204
03:24:35,030 --> 03:24:35,570
What was that?

3205
03:24:37,470 --> 03:24:38,730
Killing with the team.

3206
03:24:39,490 --> 03:24:39,870
We got it.

3207
03:24:39,870 --> 03:24:40,490
Kazuhira.

3208
03:24:43,710 --> 03:24:44,390
Kazuhira.

3209
03:24:45,850 --> 03:24:47,130
Oh my god.

3210
03:24:54,030 --> 03:24:54,830
Thank you.

3211
03:24:59,090 --> 03:25:02,370
Chop, grenade, supply.

3212
03:25:02,610 --> 03:25:04,250
This is all pretty standard.

3213
03:25:06,110 --> 03:25:08,130
Let me know when you guys are ready.

3214
03:25:08,130 --> 03:25:16,310
I don't like pressing start mission until everyone is ready because it gives a little countdown.

3215
03:25:20,370 --> 03:25:23,130
What does Kazuhira mean in Japanese again?

3216
03:25:23,630 --> 03:25:26,830
We haven't heard Kaz say anything about Japan today.

3217
03:25:27,670 --> 03:25:28,490
It's a little disappointing.

3218
03:25:31,390 --> 03:25:32,950
What are we saying about Huey?

3219
03:25:32,950 --> 03:25:36,850
Do you think when they fire people at mother base they send them off in a little...

3220
03:25:40,110 --> 03:25:41,510
Why would you say that?

3221
03:25:45,070 --> 03:25:46,250
Sorry behind there it goes.

3222
03:25:46,350 --> 03:25:47,150
I must time you out.

3223
03:25:49,050 --> 03:25:49,670
Oh wait.

3224
03:25:49,770 --> 03:25:50,330
It won't let me.

3225
03:25:50,790 --> 03:25:51,650
Why won't it let me?

3226
03:25:52,050 --> 03:25:53,210
YouTube is bugging out.

3227
03:25:56,950 --> 03:25:57,750
Not cool.

3228
03:25:57,910 --> 03:25:58,670
Not cool.

3229
03:26:00,350 --> 03:26:01,070
Oh no.

3230
03:26:01,350 --> 03:26:02,210
Wait, is that me?

3231
03:26:02,970 --> 03:26:03,990
Wait, was that my fault?

3232
03:26:04,070 --> 03:26:04,550
I'm so sorry.

3233
03:26:04,670 --> 03:26:05,190
Hold on.

3234
03:26:18,820 --> 03:26:19,620
Not cool.

3235
03:26:19,700 --> 03:26:20,360
Not cool.

3236
03:26:27,770 --> 03:26:28,970
OK, let me try again.

3237
03:26:56,120 --> 03:26:57,800
Sorry, I thought we already played five.

3238
03:26:58,740 --> 03:27:00,320
Not on my channel.

3239
03:27:01,580 --> 03:27:06,060
If it's not on my channel, don't say spoilers about it.

3240
03:27:06,060 --> 03:27:08,040
I think it's the best...

3241
03:27:12,960 --> 03:27:14,660
I got twin snake gummy snacks.

3242
03:27:14,760 --> 03:27:16,280
Oh my god, those are so good.

3243
03:27:16,340 --> 03:27:17,560
I love those.

3244
03:27:19,440 --> 03:27:20,940
I love, love, love those.

3245
03:27:21,180 --> 03:27:21,320
OK.

3246
03:27:21,980 --> 03:27:23,120
Wait, I'm prepped.

3247
03:27:23,220 --> 03:27:23,680
Let's go.

3248
03:27:25,200 --> 03:27:27,520
I'm so sorry about everybody who didn't make it in before.

3249
03:27:27,640 --> 03:27:28,200
I'm so sorry.

3250
03:27:33,140 --> 03:27:35,020
I think there was a connection issue.

3251
03:27:35,360 --> 03:27:36,320
Hopefully not this time.

3252
03:27:48,220 --> 03:27:50,040
Thank you for the 20 gift invite.

3253
03:27:50,160 --> 03:27:50,720
There it goes.

3254
03:27:50,920 --> 03:27:51,400
It's OK.

3255
03:27:51,600 --> 03:27:52,060
It's OK.

3256
03:27:54,660 --> 03:27:55,420
It's OK.

3257
03:27:55,640 --> 03:27:56,040
It's OK.

3258
03:27:56,800 --> 03:27:58,420
I, you know, obviously I know...

3259
03:28:00,620 --> 03:28:06,860
the stuff, but I try to be, I try to be fair for anybody who's watching this series for the first time.

3260
03:28:08,420 --> 03:28:11,140
Which there is a good number of people, so...

3261
03:28:17,740 --> 03:28:19,140
Onigiri!

3262
03:28:22,920 --> 03:28:25,640
Giri got gifted.

3263
03:28:26,560 --> 03:28:27,660
That's so funny.

3264
03:28:32,680 --> 03:28:33,080
Giri!

3265
03:28:37,420 --> 03:28:38,880
Let's go team!

3266
03:28:47,700 --> 03:28:49,620
And she's awake everybody!

3267
03:28:52,700 --> 03:28:55,420
I don't know when she'll start moving, so...

3268
03:29:00,200 --> 03:29:00,740
Ouch!

3269
03:29:00,900 --> 03:29:01,380
Help, help, help.

3270
03:29:08,040 --> 03:29:09,880
Oh yeah, does she start running here?

3271
03:29:13,440 --> 03:29:13,980
Weee!

3272
03:29:15,260 --> 03:29:16,000
Face me!

3273
03:29:17,660 --> 03:29:19,800
Oh my gosh, I was so close.

3274
03:29:23,500 --> 03:29:24,200
Watch out!

3275
03:29:24,340 --> 03:29:24,640
Watch out!

3276
03:29:24,760 --> 03:29:25,400
Watch out!

3277
03:29:27,200 --> 03:29:27,680
Rooks!

3278
03:29:28,680 --> 03:29:29,160
Rooks!

3279
03:29:33,300 --> 03:29:34,500
I got you!

3280
03:29:35,700 --> 03:29:36,580
Oh you got him.

3281
03:29:36,780 --> 03:29:37,320
Good, good, good.

3282
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:05,780
She's launching S-Mines you guys.

3283
03:30:06,620 --> 03:30:08,000
Do you think she's launching S-Mines?

3284
03:30:13,660 --> 03:30:14,220
Rooks!

3285
03:30:18,850 --> 03:30:20,890
Oh my gosh, she's so cool.

3286
03:30:21,270 --> 03:30:22,210
I love Peace Walker.

3287
03:30:24,630 --> 03:30:26,110
I love Peace Walker.

3288
03:30:26,230 --> 03:30:27,290
She's so cool.

3289
03:30:34,760 --> 03:30:35,480
Oh shoot.

3290
03:30:35,660 --> 03:30:35,940
Wow.

3291
03:30:36,100 --> 03:30:37,840
Sorry, my finger totally slipped.

3292
03:30:42,140 --> 03:30:43,000
We're OK.

3293
03:30:43,100 --> 03:30:43,760
We're OK team.

3294
03:30:43,760 --> 03:30:43,900
Go team!

3295
03:30:54,670 --> 03:30:55,310
Oh no!

3296
03:30:56,190 --> 03:30:57,190
Oh no, no, no, no!

3297
03:30:58,930 --> 03:30:59,910
Oh, not strike.

3298
03:31:00,470 --> 03:31:00,870
Supply.

3299
03:31:04,800 --> 03:31:05,580
Rooks are you OK?

3300
03:31:16,100 --> 03:31:17,420
Why did I get a grenade?

3301
03:31:18,340 --> 03:31:19,560
Oh I guess because the rocket's off.

3302
03:31:28,120 --> 03:31:28,920
Go team!

3303
03:31:30,660 --> 03:31:30,960
Oh.

3304
03:31:36,320 --> 03:31:36,900
Nice.

3305
03:31:39,100 --> 03:31:40,220
That was clean.

3306
03:31:40,300 --> 03:31:40,920
That was clean.

3307
03:31:48,540 --> 03:31:49,700
Launching S-Mines.

3308
03:31:51,480 --> 03:31:51,760
Wait.

3309
03:31:52,140 --> 03:31:52,900
Am I out?

3310
03:31:53,220 --> 03:31:53,720
I'm out.

3311
03:32:03,080 --> 03:32:04,840
I don't know if that hit her or not.

3312
03:32:07,160 --> 03:32:07,740
Hey!

3313
03:32:09,280 --> 03:32:10,560
Hey, where's she going?

3314
03:32:11,280 --> 03:32:12,000
Peace Walker.

3315
03:32:13,260 --> 03:32:14,740
Oh my god, don't say that.

3316
03:32:17,340 --> 03:32:19,040
Stop blurting on the battlefield.

3317
03:32:31,670 --> 03:32:33,330
Oh, I missed.

3318
03:32:36,950 --> 03:32:39,910
You know what, while we're waiting for her to come back...

3319
03:32:44,010 --> 03:32:44,610
No,

3320
03:32:58,240 --> 03:32:58,920
no, no!

3321
03:33:07,930 --> 03:33:09,250
Is she about to charge?

3322
03:33:11,350 --> 03:33:13,150
Come on snake, get up!

3323
03:33:25,590 --> 03:33:26,730
That was pretty good.

3324
03:33:30,090 --> 03:33:31,830
She's targeting me you guys.

3325
03:33:31,910 --> 03:33:32,910
She's obsessed with me.

3326
03:33:33,330 --> 03:33:35,630
Are you obsessed with me?

3327
03:33:35,630 --> 03:33:36,030
This car?

3328
03:33:39,830 --> 03:33:43,010
Oh my god!

3329
03:33:43,070 --> 03:33:43,390
Oh my god!

3330
03:33:43,390 --> 03:33:43,650
Oh my god!

3331
03:33:43,770 --> 03:33:44,410
Oh my god!

3332
03:33:44,450 --> 03:33:44,750
I'm stuck!

3333
03:33:45,070 --> 03:33:45,990
You guys, I can't see shit!

3334
03:33:47,630 --> 03:33:48,350
I'm stuck!

3335
03:33:57,310 --> 03:33:58,490
That was so bad.

3336
03:33:59,050 --> 03:34:01,170
That was like the worst possible scenario.

3337
03:34:14,040 --> 03:34:15,140
Face me!

3338
03:34:21,200 --> 03:34:21,840
Oh shit!

3339
03:34:22,460 --> 03:34:23,160
Oh damn!

3340
03:34:23,820 --> 03:34:24,780
Oh my god, I almost died.

3341
03:34:26,600 --> 03:34:28,620
Oh my god, that took out two rations.

3342
03:34:28,720 --> 03:34:29,200
That's crazy.

3343
03:34:35,280 --> 03:34:36,400
Good job!

3344
03:34:38,060 --> 03:34:39,460
Good job team!

3345
03:34:42,820 --> 03:34:46,280
That one final hit watching that go...

3346
03:34:47,200 --> 03:34:48,260
Was so good.

3347
03:34:49,780 --> 03:34:51,280
Good job team!

3348
03:34:51,400 --> 03:34:51,920
Good job!

3349
03:35:00,800 --> 03:35:02,320
Here it comes.

3350
03:35:03,920 --> 03:35:06,860
One of my favorite parts of the game.

3351
03:35:08,040 --> 03:35:09,720
I'm not ready.

3352
03:35:12,580 --> 03:35:14,160
Maybe I'm just old.

3353
03:35:15,040 --> 03:35:16,420
Nah, Rooks is great.

3354
03:35:20,480 --> 03:35:22,520
Feels incoming you guys.

3355
03:35:22,520 --> 03:35:23,320
How's NORAD?

3356
03:35:41,140 --> 03:35:43,820
That fight literally took me hours to finish.

3357
03:35:43,920 --> 03:35:45,200
No, it's because we have a team of four.

3358
03:35:45,200 --> 03:35:46,140
Of course.

3359
03:35:49,860 --> 03:35:52,240
By yourself it's so difficult.

3360
03:35:55,720 --> 03:35:56,240
What the?

3361
03:36:07,400 --> 03:36:07,760
What the?

3362
03:36:09,200 --> 03:36:10,000
What?

3363
03:36:12,860 --> 03:36:13,640
Wait, what?

3364
03:36:14,560 --> 03:36:15,260
Wait, what?

3365
03:36:15,760 --> 03:36:16,040
What's happening?

3366
03:36:18,620 --> 03:36:19,560
Wait, what is this?

3367
03:36:21,080 --> 03:36:22,080
Let me check my table.

3368
03:36:33,080 --> 03:36:33,560
Ok.

3369
03:36:38,780 --> 03:36:39,460
That was weird.

3370
03:36:54,660 --> 03:36:55,100
What?

3371
03:37:01,280 --> 03:37:03,640
Or maybe one of the others, or maybe...

3372
03:37:07,980 --> 03:37:08,420
No!

3373
03:37:09,960 --> 03:37:12,700
Of course he did, stupid dummy.

3374
03:37:12,700 --> 03:37:13,680
Dumb.

3375
03:37:36,740 --> 03:37:39,540
But the speech bubble said the Pentagon.

3376
03:37:42,700 --> 03:37:43,960
Then who?

3377
03:37:48,430 --> 03:37:49,700
Oh my god.

3378
03:37:49,900 --> 03:37:52,900
When will my day come that Big Boss calls me...

3379
03:37:53,640 --> 03:37:55,140
Smart dumb man.

3380
03:38:16,320 --> 03:38:17,460
Maybe for your birthday.

3381
03:38:19,480 --> 03:38:19,620
Nah.

3382
03:38:32,960 --> 03:38:33,360
Oh,

3383
03:38:37,400 --> 03:38:37,960
hey all Raiders.

3384
03:38:38,160 --> 03:38:38,560
Thank you for the raid.

3385
03:38:38,560 --> 03:38:38,920
Thank you for the raid.

3386
03:38:41,260 --> 03:38:44,560
This is kind of spoilers for Metal Gear Peace Walker, so...

3387
03:38:58,740 --> 03:38:59,320
Yes.

3388
03:39:02,420 --> 03:39:04,900
He held a grudge for that forever.

3389
03:39:04,900 --> 03:39:07,080
Only a handful of people would know.

3390
03:39:11,340 --> 03:39:15,300
Because he's stanky.

3391
03:39:34,900 --> 03:39:36,800
Trust me.

3392
03:39:40,220 --> 03:39:41,620
Everything.

3393
03:39:55,090 --> 03:39:59,370
Yay, all is good.

3394
03:39:59,370 --> 03:40:04,310
When we meet again, I hope you'll shake my hand.

3395
03:40:04,990 --> 03:40:06,370
What a fanboy.

3396
03:40:06,710 --> 03:40:11,050
All is not good.

3397
03:40:16,130 --> 03:40:18,010
Butterfly in the sky.

3398
03:40:29,370 --> 03:40:30,810
She's calling to you.

3399
03:40:47,460 --> 03:40:48,580
Oh yeah,

3400
03:40:52,360 --> 03:40:53,140
we lost somebody.

3401
03:40:53,260 --> 03:40:55,340
There's only three now.

3402
03:40:55,540 --> 03:40:56,980
Oh no, who did we lose?

3403
03:40:58,640 --> 03:40:59,820
Maybe my T-shirt.

3404
03:41:04,760 --> 03:41:05,640
Boss.

3405
03:41:34,640 --> 03:41:37,220
All is good.

3406
03:41:48,680 --> 03:42:02,760
The ten minutes.

3407
03:42:05,360 --> 03:42:08,020
I'm working on it.

3408
03:42:16,840 --> 03:42:19,640
The pedals.

3409
03:42:27,260 --> 03:42:29,320
It's so HAL.

3410
03:42:37,220 --> 03:42:41,360
Her pain sounds are so sad.

3411
03:42:48,200 --> 03:42:51,240
Yeah, very HAL.

3412
03:43:04,640 --> 03:43:11,780
It won't be a stylish marriage.

3413
03:43:12,480 --> 03:43:13,980
I can't remember.

3414
03:43:15,640 --> 03:43:17,320
The way you look.

3415
03:43:18,020 --> 03:43:19,500
I cannot see.

3416
03:43:21,480 --> 03:43:27,500
She can't even remember Pi anymore.

3417
03:43:36,480 --> 03:43:38,000
Is this familiar?

3418
03:43:59,230 --> 03:44:00,990
Don't say it.

3419
03:44:01,070 --> 03:44:02,350
Don't say his name.

3420
03:44:03,350 --> 03:44:04,530
No!

3421
03:44:09,270 --> 03:44:12,470
He's got so much room in his pants.

3422
03:44:24,910 --> 03:44:27,470
It hurts.

3423
03:44:29,250 --> 03:44:30,210
It hurts.

3424
03:44:39,690 --> 03:44:40,810
It stopped.

3425
03:44:46,030 --> 03:44:48,630
The data uplink is bypassing the mammal pod.

3426
03:44:50,250 --> 03:44:51,830
Put down the gun.

3427
03:44:52,770 --> 03:44:54,130
Come to your senses, man.

3428
03:44:54,290 --> 03:44:57,670
The fate of the world, the fate of the earth is at stake here.

3429
03:45:00,970 --> 03:45:01,530
Why?

3430
03:45:05,350 --> 03:45:06,710
I don't understand.

3431
03:45:09,290 --> 03:45:09,830
Answer me.

3432
03:45:10,290 --> 03:45:11,350
Tell me why.

3433
03:45:12,850 --> 03:45:13,870
Answer me!

3434
03:45:21,550 --> 03:45:22,790
I hate her.

3435
03:45:22,950 --> 03:45:24,170
Six minutes remaining.

3436
03:45:26,050 --> 03:45:26,570
Wait.

3437
03:45:26,570 --> 03:45:28,250
Authority rests with me now.

3438
03:45:28,550 --> 03:45:30,190
I'm ordering a retaliation.

3439
03:45:30,490 --> 03:45:31,390
No, don't.

3440
03:45:31,650 --> 03:45:32,930
It's the end of us all.

3441
03:45:32,990 --> 03:45:33,870
Who gives a damn?

3442
03:45:34,070 --> 03:45:35,990
I'm not gonna sit here and die like a dog.

3443
03:45:36,030 --> 03:45:40,470
If the Russians are gonna kill my family, destroy my country, I'm taking them with me.

3444
03:45:40,470 --> 03:45:41,990
You see now, Chairman.

3445
03:45:42,570 --> 03:45:44,830
Deterrence is just a fool's dream.

3446
03:45:45,850 --> 03:45:46,110
No!

3447
03:45:46,390 --> 03:45:46,710
Why?

3448
03:45:47,690 --> 03:45:48,870
Why won't it stop?

3449
03:45:49,030 --> 03:45:49,050
Our peace.

3450
03:45:49,230 --> 03:45:49,970
Our peace.

3451
03:45:50,190 --> 03:45:54,450
Sometimes the body continues to live even after the brain is damaged.

3452
03:45:55,470 --> 03:45:57,850
The boss AI isn't doing this.

3453
03:45:58,650 --> 03:46:01,050
I think it's something rather more primitive.

3454
03:46:01,270 --> 03:46:02,730
You created a monster.

3455
03:46:03,250 --> 03:46:06,290
Reptile has taken up mammal's dying wish.

3456
03:46:07,330 --> 03:46:07,970
No.

3457
03:46:09,130 --> 03:46:10,250
Stop it.

3458
03:46:11,610 --> 03:46:13,290
Don't just sit there.

3459
03:46:13,650 --> 03:46:14,870
Stop it!

3460
03:46:21,830 --> 03:46:24,470
Goldman was so wrong.

3461
03:46:24,570 --> 03:46:24,770
I know.

3462
03:46:24,890 --> 03:46:27,850
What a dummy, idiot, stupid head.

3463
03:46:28,670 --> 03:46:29,570
Lizard.

3464
03:46:36,390 --> 03:46:38,610
Good job team.

3465
03:46:38,610 --> 03:46:40,230
What did we lose?

3466
03:46:41,930 --> 03:46:45,670
Oh, it was like the one that... What was your name?

3467
03:46:47,190 --> 03:46:48,250
I'm sorry.

3468
03:46:52,410 --> 03:46:54,270
Exceeding 250 co-ops.

3469
03:46:54,770 --> 03:46:55,110
Nice.

3470
03:46:59,370 --> 03:46:59,970
Yeah, Leo.

3471
03:47:00,210 --> 03:47:00,630
Thank you.

3472
03:47:02,410 --> 03:47:03,570
Leo, I hope you're okay.

3473
03:47:07,750 --> 03:47:09,570
Sadness happening soon.

3474
03:47:10,450 --> 03:47:11,930
Oh, I meant to go to the mission select.

3475
03:47:12,070 --> 03:47:12,410
My bad.

3476
03:47:19,130 --> 03:47:20,770
We got some more guys.

3477
03:47:21,910 --> 03:47:24,070
Cod, Shrew and Sparrow.

3478
03:47:25,170 --> 03:47:26,370
Wow, you're good at combat.

3479
03:47:26,870 --> 03:47:27,750
They're all good at combat.

3480
03:47:29,050 --> 03:47:29,770
Take you.

3481
03:47:34,270 --> 03:47:35,250
He's dead.

3482
03:47:35,250 --> 03:47:37,410
He died in combat.

3483
03:47:38,930 --> 03:47:41,450
Peace Walker Battle 3!

3484
03:47:46,750 --> 03:47:50,210
See buddy, you can get in again.

3485
03:47:51,250 --> 03:47:53,810
If you did the last Peace Walker fight though, try to...

3486
03:47:56,570 --> 03:47:57,130
Wait.

3487
03:47:59,990 --> 03:48:03,890
If you did the last Peace Walker fight, maybe give someone else a chance.

3488
03:48:10,940 --> 03:48:11,740
Thank you.

3489
03:48:12,640 --> 03:48:13,720
If someone joins.

3490
03:48:15,020 --> 03:48:15,760
There we go!

3491
03:48:17,200 --> 03:48:18,600
Thank you guys.

3492
03:48:18,780 --> 03:48:19,220
Thank you, thank you.

3493
03:48:21,060 --> 03:48:22,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3494
03:48:22,700 --> 03:48:23,400
Alright team.

3495
03:48:26,020 --> 03:48:27,060
Alright team.

3496
03:48:28,760 --> 03:48:29,800
Let's go baby.

3497
03:48:30,040 --> 03:48:30,580
Mission prep.

3498
03:48:31,260 --> 03:48:32,120
Going with the team.

3499
03:48:33,120 --> 03:48:33,640
Survival?

3500
03:48:34,000 --> 03:48:35,480
That doesn't sound like a t-shirt to me.

3501
03:48:36,460 --> 03:48:37,760
That's more like it.

3502
03:48:41,660 --> 03:48:43,660
I'm ready when you guys are.

3503
03:48:44,500 --> 03:48:45,500
Going with the team.

3504
03:48:49,290 --> 03:48:51,790
Thank you guys for being so gracious.

3505
03:48:52,070 --> 03:48:53,890
You guys gave up your spots so fast.

3506
03:48:53,970 --> 03:48:55,070
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3507
03:48:55,250 --> 03:48:56,170
I really appreciate it.

3508
03:48:59,610 --> 03:49:03,770
Alright, Unstoppable, Gibsonator and Brighty.

3509
03:49:04,090 --> 03:49:05,570
Let's go into battle!

3510
03:49:08,600 --> 03:49:10,000
No connection error please.

3511
03:49:12,880 --> 03:49:13,660
Start?

3512
03:49:14,040 --> 03:49:15,540
I click start the menu?

3513
03:49:15,960 --> 03:49:16,840
I click start mission.

3514
03:49:24,260 --> 03:49:25,040
I

3515
03:49:28,240 --> 03:49:32,980
think maybe someone had a connection issue.

3516
03:49:34,560 --> 03:49:35,780
Let's try again.

3517
03:49:39,680 --> 03:49:40,660
Brighty in.

3518
03:49:41,720 --> 03:49:42,880
Arisaka in.

3519
03:49:43,640 --> 03:49:44,680
Gibsonator in.

3520
03:49:45,300 --> 03:49:46,720
Alright, let's try again.

3521
03:49:50,560 --> 03:49:51,860
Let's try again.

3522
03:50:04,870 --> 03:50:06,150
I'm scared.

3523
03:50:07,770 --> 03:50:09,190
Gibsonator, is it you?

3524
03:50:12,110 --> 03:50:15,630
Is it because you are so far away?

3525
03:50:17,890 --> 03:50:19,030
We made it!

3526
03:50:24,510 --> 03:50:25,310
WSF!

3527
03:50:30,030 --> 03:50:32,050
It worked baby.

3528
03:50:32,430 --> 03:50:32,890
Alright.

3529
03:50:34,030 --> 03:50:35,630
We got this team!

3530
03:50:35,750 --> 03:50:36,890
We got this team!

3531
03:50:41,000 --> 03:50:43,280
No nuclear war for us today!

3532
03:50:52,060 --> 03:50:53,600
Oh my god, the car's outfit!

3533
03:50:53,880 --> 03:50:54,920
Can I look at you real quick?

3534
03:50:55,620 --> 03:50:56,900
I didn't see it before.

3535
03:51:00,720 --> 03:51:03,660
Huey never shows up on the loading screen.

3536
03:51:09,870 --> 03:51:10,550
Wait, wait, wait.

3537
03:51:10,570 --> 03:51:11,390
Come here, come here Arisaka.

3538
03:51:11,470 --> 03:51:12,130
Come here, come here.

3539
03:51:13,230 --> 03:51:14,890
You look so good.

3540
03:51:14,910 --> 03:51:15,890
I love it.

3541
03:51:35,380 --> 03:51:37,060
A lot of explosions now.

3542
03:51:37,280 --> 03:51:38,340
Oh I thought I clicked reload.

3543
03:51:39,720 --> 03:51:40,220
Get

3544
03:51:49,550 --> 03:51:50,810
my goose stomp out.

3545
03:51:56,790 --> 03:51:58,470
Reloading too fast for the game.

3546
03:52:20,780 --> 03:52:23,580
I guess it really doesn't matter if we shoot the mammal pod or not.

3547
03:52:24,040 --> 03:52:25,340
Maybe we gotta shoot the brain.

3548
03:52:29,580 --> 03:52:30,480
Shoot the other one.

3549
03:52:44,020 --> 03:52:45,240
Good job team!

3550
03:52:50,060 --> 03:52:51,580
Thank you.

3551
03:53:01,580 --> 03:53:03,460
Doing the Jackal pose.

3552
03:53:03,580 --> 03:53:04,600
That's what I'm saying.

3553
03:53:05,360 --> 03:53:06,040
How

3554
03:53:12,690 --> 03:53:13,550
are you guys?

3555
03:53:14,670 --> 03:53:15,850
Are you guys having fun?

3556
03:53:16,950 --> 03:53:19,270
I tried to run into you guys.

3557
03:53:28,640 --> 03:53:29,400
OK.

3558
03:53:30,220 --> 03:53:31,500
Well, good fight.

3559
03:53:36,940 --> 03:53:38,360
Good fight everybody.

3560
03:53:41,000 --> 03:53:42,180
That's the time.

3561
03:53:42,420 --> 03:53:43,060
Peace!

3562
03:53:52,380 --> 03:53:53,560
Don't do it Miku!

3563
03:53:53,640 --> 03:53:54,600
Don't do it Miku!

3564
03:53:55,440 --> 03:53:56,900
Don't do it Miku!

3565
03:53:57,620 --> 03:53:58,580
Miku is possessed.

3566
03:54:09,860 --> 03:54:11,640
Oh no.

3567
03:54:12,360 --> 03:54:13,500
Vocaloid pod.

3568
03:55:15,670 --> 03:55:17,510
My heart.

3569
03:55:22,030 --> 03:55:27,750
A loading screen.

3570
03:56:03,770 --> 03:56:05,530
That voice.

3571
03:56:10,770 --> 03:56:11,790
What?

3572
03:56:12,650 --> 03:56:14,290
What's going on?

3573
03:56:14,550 --> 03:56:15,870
That song.

3574
03:56:17,190 --> 03:56:19,630
Is that you?

3575
03:56:20,290 --> 03:56:21,310
How in love?

3576
03:56:21,570 --> 03:56:22,850
The culture is happening.

3577
03:56:26,450 --> 03:56:28,770
A ghost in machine?

3578
03:56:37,950 --> 03:56:41,310
She's drowning herself to stop the transmission.

3579
03:56:43,750 --> 03:56:44,510
Look!

3580
03:56:49,800 --> 03:56:52,060
It's functional compensation.

3581
03:56:52,920 --> 03:56:56,620
When the human brain is damaged, sometimes it recovers over time.

3582
03:56:57,200 --> 03:57:00,860
Other parts of the brain take over the functions of the damaged parts.

3583
03:57:02,160 --> 03:57:06,340
Mammal and reptile were patterned after different parts of the human brain.

3584
03:57:06,340 --> 03:57:13,520
When those parts were assembled together into one, they must have become capable of functional compensation.

3585
03:57:14,880 --> 03:57:17,200
Stop putting science to it Huey.

3586
03:57:18,020 --> 03:57:19,060
It's love.

3587
03:57:20,860 --> 03:57:22,500
It's magic.

3588
03:57:24,100 --> 03:57:27,060
It's the boss' will for peace.

3589
03:57:38,760 --> 03:57:39,480
The song.

3590
03:57:40,400 --> 03:57:43,340
It's clearly not thinking rationally.

3591
03:57:43,600 --> 03:57:45,420
It's not using its head.

3592
03:57:46,700 --> 03:57:49,360
It's using its heart.

3593
03:57:50,100 --> 03:57:53,520
This is the fate she chose for herself.

3594
03:58:02,790 --> 03:58:04,730
The boss' innocence has been proven.

3595
03:58:07,110 --> 03:58:08,350
Do you hear it Snake?

3596
03:58:09,610 --> 03:58:11,610
Do you hear the boss' song?

3597
03:58:16,370 --> 03:58:19,150
You saw it, didn't you?

3598
03:58:21,990 --> 03:58:23,990
When you went to space.

3599
03:58:27,170 --> 03:58:30,010
That there's beauty outside of battle.

3600
03:58:35,670 --> 03:58:38,130
At last, I understand.

3601
03:58:39,030 --> 03:58:43,170
In the end, it was you who put down your gun.

3602
03:58:45,050 --> 03:58:47,590
And chose instead to sing.

3603
03:58:49,470 --> 03:58:51,710
They can all hear you.

3604
03:58:52,290 --> 03:58:53,430
I know they can.

3605
03:58:55,070 --> 03:58:57,730
And your will shall surely live on.

3606
03:58:59,510 --> 03:59:00,910
That's what you wanted.

3607
03:59:01,690 --> 03:59:05,010
So much that you gave up everything you had.

3608
03:59:07,970 --> 03:59:09,990
But you couldn't achieve it.

3609
03:59:13,710 --> 03:59:15,050
Isn't that right?

3610
03:59:15,050 --> 03:59:19,450
And still, all you can do is sing.

3611
03:59:21,770 --> 03:59:25,050
There's no peace to be found anywhere.

3612
03:59:26,830 --> 03:59:31,330
And so, we can only keep on hoping.

3613
03:59:34,410 --> 03:59:38,910
Hoping for the illusion we call peace.

3614
03:59:38,910 --> 03:59:39,070
Peace.

3615
03:59:57,090 --> 03:59:58,910
That's too good.

3616
04:00:02,130 --> 04:00:03,550
Oh my god.

3617
04:00:04,230 --> 04:00:05,750
Look, and now there's peace.

3618
04:00:07,030 --> 04:00:09,910
In time, all standing armies must be totally abolished.

3619
04:00:10,390 --> 04:00:11,170
Immanuel Kant.

3620
04:00:12,070 --> 04:00:13,650
Perpetual... What did I say?

3621
04:00:13,990 --> 04:00:14,450
I don't know.

3622
04:00:25,160 --> 04:00:26,120
Perpetual peace.

3623
04:00:26,220 --> 04:00:26,700
Thank you.

3624
04:00:30,480 --> 04:00:32,140
Sing a song.

3625
04:00:50,320 --> 04:00:52,980
This song makes me cry.

3626
04:01:03,150 --> 04:01:07,170
To last your whole life long.

3627
04:01:07,910 --> 04:01:14,410
Don't worry that it's not good enough for anyone else to hear.

3628
04:01:15,270 --> 04:01:16,470
Just sing.

3629
04:01:17,950 --> 04:01:20,170
Sing a song.

3630
04:01:20,170 --> 04:01:21,530
Just sing a song.

3631
04:01:26,890 --> 04:01:28,810
There's of course an after bit.

3632
04:01:29,230 --> 04:01:30,530
Just sing.

3633
04:01:31,710 --> 04:01:33,150
Sing a song.

3634
04:01:35,220 --> 04:01:36,580
So good.

3635
04:01:37,080 --> 04:01:38,480
So good.

3636
04:01:38,760 --> 04:01:42,380
Such a good ending for the boss, I suppose.

3637
04:01:46,000 --> 04:01:47,820
Where are my backup singers at?

3638
04:01:58,470 --> 04:01:59,750
So, so good.

3639
04:02:02,330 --> 04:02:04,810
He was like, change that stinking radio.

3640
04:02:05,530 --> 04:02:08,090
Dedicated in loving memory of Project Ito.

3641
04:02:12,910 --> 04:02:13,430
Okay.

3642
04:02:17,730 --> 04:02:23,510
The US and the Soviet Union agreed on a framework of assault to the treaty limits the number of bombs.

3643
04:02:23,950 --> 04:02:26,450
Among that number, MIRVs are restricted to 1320.

3644
04:02:26,650 --> 04:02:31,250
The former Prime Minister of Japan received a Nobel Peace Prize for non-nuclear principles.

3645
04:02:31,990 --> 04:02:33,490
Nicaragua takes sausages.

3646
04:02:33,790 --> 04:02:34,830
Oh no, that's not good.

3647
04:02:34,830 --> 04:02:38,530
The former President of Costa Rica admits to collaborating with the CIA.

3648
04:02:39,810 --> 04:02:41,830
Saigon reunites North and South Vietnam.

3649
04:02:42,770 --> 04:02:46,550
The Soviet Union and the US complete a peaceful journey.

3650
04:02:47,110 --> 04:02:48,330
Peace, peace, peace.

3651
04:02:51,530 --> 04:02:53,030
Huey becomes a father.

3652
04:02:53,230 --> 04:02:54,470
He names his son Hal.

3653
04:02:59,360 --> 04:03:01,700
Gorbachev becomes a power.

3654
04:03:02,040 --> 04:03:02,860
Berlin Wall falls.

3655
04:03:02,980 --> 04:03:05,840
Germany is reunified the following year.

3656
04:03:05,840 --> 04:03:08,800
Costa Rican government persuades Panama to abolish its military.

3657
04:03:12,460 --> 04:03:12,980
Amongst...

3658
04:03:12,980 --> 04:03:15,540
To be continued in Chapter 5.

3659
04:03:39,480 --> 04:03:44,140
Oh my gosh, I saw a video of Lori Allen yesterday.

3660
04:03:44,380 --> 04:03:49,160
Except it wasn't her talking about Metal Gear.

3661
04:03:49,220 --> 04:03:52,100
It was her talking as Pearl from Spongebob.

3662
04:03:52,240 --> 04:03:54,220
I was like, it's so funny.

3663
04:03:54,400 --> 04:03:56,820
When she just talks normally, she sounds so much like the boss.

3664
04:03:58,940 --> 04:04:00,440
My original save was on the PS3.

3665
04:04:00,580 --> 04:04:02,380
It was so fun replaying this alongside with you.

3666
04:04:02,780 --> 04:04:04,600
My new Zeke is so far from being done.

3667
04:04:05,520 --> 04:04:07,580
Yeah, it takes a long time to complete it.

3668
04:04:29,620 --> 04:04:33,720
I will reach out to you.

3669
04:04:34,160 --> 04:04:37,080
And leave this all behind.

3670
04:04:37,800 --> 04:04:39,560
When heavens divide.

3671
04:04:48,120 --> 04:04:49,200
So good.

3672
04:04:49,820 --> 04:04:51,700
So, so, so good.

3673
04:04:52,620 --> 04:04:53,500
So good.

3674
04:04:53,640 --> 04:04:54,680
I love this game.

3675
04:04:55,700 --> 04:04:57,440
I love this game so much.

3676
04:04:57,460 --> 04:04:58,380
It's so stupid.

3677
04:04:59,380 --> 04:05:01,900
It's so beautiful at the same time.

3678
04:05:07,450 --> 04:05:09,480
When heavens divide.

3679
04:05:10,060 --> 04:05:14,880
I will see the choices within my hands.

3680
04:05:15,420 --> 04:05:22,540
How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

3681
04:05:22,540 --> 04:05:29,680
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fear.

3682
04:05:30,220 --> 04:05:37,320
Do you feel the storm approach as the end draws near?

3683
04:05:37,760 --> 04:05:39,500
When heavens divide.

3684
04:05:40,160 --> 04:05:45,020
Time will come to softly lay me down.

3685
04:05:45,020 --> 04:05:52,280
I can see a face that I long to see.

3686
04:05:52,340 --> 04:05:53,500
Vocaloid!

3687
04:05:54,380 --> 04:05:54,980
Miku!

3688
04:05:55,480 --> 04:05:56,300
Miku!

3689
04:05:59,540 --> 04:06:07,380
Leaving a trace for love to find a way.

3690
04:06:07,620 --> 04:06:10,620
When heavens divide.

3691
04:06:13,100 --> 04:06:13,680
Time...

3692
04:06:13,680 --> 04:06:15,980
The lyrics have such a different meaning.

3693
04:06:16,260 --> 04:06:19,440
Like, they mean so much more after you play this game, you know?

3694
04:06:20,140 --> 04:06:21,180
Like, it's just...

3695
04:06:23,370 --> 04:06:26,920
It's like, Snake Eater is the boss talking to Snake.

3696
04:06:27,000 --> 04:06:30,020
And this song is Snake talking to the boss.

3697
04:06:30,140 --> 04:06:30,800
It's just...

3698
04:06:30,800 --> 04:06:33,420
The blood of my desire.

3699
04:06:34,100 --> 04:06:35,620
The very last time.

3700
04:06:36,150 --> 04:06:44,020
My name scorched into the sky.

3701
04:06:45,300 --> 04:06:46,880
When heavens divide.

3702
04:06:47,580 --> 04:06:52,440
I will see the choices within my hands.

3703
04:06:52,920 --> 04:07:00,020
How can we ever protect and fight with our tiny souls?

3704
04:07:00,020 --> 04:07:07,060
Let me shine like the sun through the doubts and fear.

3705
04:07:07,340 --> 04:07:14,800
Do you feel the storm approach as the end draws near?

3706
04:07:15,400 --> 04:07:16,880
When heavens divide.

3707
04:07:17,820 --> 04:07:22,340
Time will come to softly lay me down.

3708
04:07:23,020 --> 04:07:29,460
Then I can see a face that I long to see.

3709
04:07:29,460 --> 04:07:36,980
And for you, only you, I would give anything.

3710
04:07:37,800 --> 04:07:44,520
Leaving a trace for love to find the way.

3711
04:07:45,180 --> 04:07:46,740
When heavens divide.

3712
04:07:55,580 --> 04:07:56,940
It's a heart-wrenching line.

3713
04:07:57,100 --> 04:07:57,640
I know.

3714
04:07:58,280 --> 04:08:02,620
And for you,

3715
04:08:07,440 --> 04:08:11,380
only you, I would give anything.

3716
04:08:12,170 --> 04:08:15,160
To find the way.

3717
04:08:17,100 --> 04:08:19,580
When heavens divide.

3718
04:08:27,440 --> 04:08:28,600
So good.

3719
04:08:29,200 --> 04:08:30,740
So good, so good.

3720
04:08:30,940 --> 04:08:32,200
We're waiting for the end of credits.

3721
04:08:32,740 --> 04:08:33,300
UNIQLO!

3722
04:08:38,020 --> 04:08:39,900
07, 07, 07.

3723
04:08:40,640 --> 04:08:42,640
And then, oh my god.

3724
04:08:43,040 --> 04:08:47,160
The theme song of this game is just too good too.

3725
04:08:52,120 --> 04:08:53,520
Oh, Space Odyssey.

3726
04:08:54,360 --> 04:08:54,980
Sing!

3727
04:09:02,020 --> 04:09:04,000
We haven't heard that song yet.

3728
04:09:10,060 --> 04:09:11,820
These are all the Walkman songs.

3729
04:09:18,460 --> 04:09:19,360
So good.

3730
04:09:19,440 --> 04:09:21,980
I remember hearing this song at the...

3731
04:09:22,600 --> 04:09:25,680
Oh my god, I heard this song at the Metal Gear Orchestra.

3732
04:09:26,600 --> 04:09:29,620
And I was literally just a puddle on the ground.

3733
04:09:29,820 --> 04:09:33,000
And my tears were like, never ending.

3734
04:09:33,260 --> 04:09:35,880
My whole face was wet with how much I was crying.

3735
04:09:36,000 --> 04:09:36,900
It was so beautiful.

3736
04:09:37,680 --> 04:09:39,760
I'm so happy I could go.

3737
04:09:43,880 --> 04:09:45,480
Ok, a little bit more.

3738
04:10:12,010 --> 04:10:12,730
I remember that.

3739
04:10:14,830 --> 04:10:17,010
Yes, but also...

3740
04:10:18,030 --> 04:10:19,810
She betrayed me, Kaz.

3741
04:10:20,950 --> 04:10:21,450
She what?

3742
04:10:22,030 --> 04:10:22,670
In the end.

3743
04:10:23,330 --> 04:10:25,170
She put down her gun.

3744
04:10:25,610 --> 04:10:30,530
And when she did, she rejected her entire life up to that point.

3745
04:10:31,410 --> 04:10:32,510
Including me.

3746
04:10:33,830 --> 04:10:34,610
What do you mean?

3747
04:10:35,830 --> 04:10:39,630
In giving up her life, she abandoned everything she was as a soldier.

3748
04:10:40,950 --> 04:10:42,270
And you consider that betrayal?

3749
04:10:44,230 --> 04:10:46,050
I won't make the same choice as her.

3750
04:10:47,010 --> 04:10:49,990
My future is going to be different.

3751
04:10:51,290 --> 04:10:51,610
Snake.

3752
04:10:52,310 --> 04:10:54,210
Yeah, that's right.

3753
04:10:54,330 --> 04:10:54,850
Here he is.

3754
04:10:54,910 --> 04:10:59,030
From now on, call me Big Boss.

3755
04:10:59,190 --> 04:10:59,550
Yeah!

3756
04:11:00,190 --> 04:11:01,490
Big Boss!

3757
04:11:06,230 --> 04:11:06,870
Yellow!

3758
04:11:14,060 --> 04:11:15,140
Wait one second.

3759
04:11:15,960 --> 04:11:17,300
I think my thing is all broken.

3760
04:11:17,960 --> 04:11:18,500
There we go.

3761
04:11:21,160 --> 04:11:21,920
Tuxedo!

3762
04:11:22,640 --> 04:11:24,560
We got the illusion of peace.

3763
04:11:49,910 --> 04:11:53,150
All signs are her scholarship came from the KGB too.

3764
04:11:53,610 --> 04:11:57,010
Even if they let him go, she's not going to be seeing any more money.

3765
04:11:57,630 --> 04:11:59,010
It wouldn't have been much anyway.

3766
04:11:59,950 --> 04:12:01,770
So, I was wondering...

3767
04:12:01,770 --> 04:12:02,850
Let my girl get an education!

3768
04:12:02,850 --> 04:12:04,470
What about letting her stay here for a while?

3769
04:12:05,090 --> 04:12:05,870
What does she think?

3770
04:12:05,890 --> 04:12:06,390
The doorknob.

3771
04:12:06,410 --> 04:12:07,830
She says she wants to help out.

3772
04:12:08,670 --> 04:12:09,910
It would only be temporary.

3773
04:12:10,350 --> 04:12:11,210
She's still in shock.

3774
04:12:11,410 --> 04:12:13,850
Right now, no one understands her better than we do.

3775
04:12:14,350 --> 04:12:14,650
Okay.

3776
04:12:15,550 --> 04:12:16,350
But Kaz...

3777
04:12:16,350 --> 04:12:17,230
Sorry, I didn't realize it was so loud.

3778
04:12:17,230 --> 04:12:18,190
Don't take your eyes off her.

3779
04:12:18,690 --> 04:12:19,330
What do you mean?

3780
04:12:19,330 --> 04:12:21,890
It won't be easy getting used to this kind of life.

3781
04:12:22,310 --> 04:12:23,030
I know, Snake.

3782
04:12:23,470 --> 04:12:25,570
I'm not trying to turn her into one of us.

3783
04:12:25,970 --> 04:12:26,530
Yay, pause!

3784
04:12:26,570 --> 04:12:28,130
You need to talk to her yourself later.

3785
04:12:28,750 --> 04:12:28,970
Okay.

3786
04:12:29,810 --> 04:12:30,250
And...

3787
04:12:31,450 --> 04:12:33,250
Doctor Strangelove wants to come too.

3788
04:12:33,330 --> 04:12:34,450
Yay, Strangelove!

3789
04:12:35,010 --> 04:12:36,230
Well, she's out of a job now.

3790
04:12:36,450 --> 04:12:38,310
And she has a problem returning to England.

3791
04:12:39,030 --> 04:12:40,530
You can talk to her about it.

3792
04:12:40,910 --> 04:12:43,950
Anyway, you don't need me to tell you how good she'd be for R&D.

3793
04:12:45,550 --> 04:12:45,990
Yippee!

3794
04:12:46,970 --> 04:12:48,390
I love pause.

3795
04:12:48,390 --> 04:12:48,870
Yippee!

3796
04:12:49,450 --> 04:12:52,570
Cecile, the girl who is never seen...

3797
04:12:52,570 --> 04:12:53,870
Never heard from again.

3798
04:13:00,890 --> 04:13:05,650
Oh, this guy is about to be the biggest thorn in our side, everybody.

3799
04:13:06,810 --> 04:13:09,390
This guy is about to be...

3800
04:13:10,170 --> 04:13:12,870
A real stink.

3801
04:13:14,990 --> 04:13:16,890
Do we have to put her in there with Huey?

3802
04:13:21,510 --> 04:13:22,870
Black Seabream...

3803
04:13:22,870 --> 04:13:27,530
I'm sorry, you're no longer needed.

3804
04:13:29,930 --> 04:13:31,290
You're fired.

3805
04:13:31,930 --> 04:13:32,790
What about pause?

3806
04:13:32,870 --> 04:13:33,510
Where would she go?

3807
04:13:34,510 --> 04:13:35,450
Food, of course.

3808
04:13:36,230 --> 04:13:37,070
To the mess hall.

3809
04:13:37,830 --> 04:13:38,830
And to R&D.

3810
04:13:40,230 --> 04:13:41,410
You're fired.

3811
04:13:52,090 --> 04:13:57,170
But guys, but Minto, what are you still worrying about?

3812
04:14:00,130 --> 04:14:02,990
Did you not beat the game?

3813
04:14:04,270 --> 04:14:05,630
Why are you still...

3814
04:14:05,630 --> 04:14:08,990
Why are you still trying to get more stuff?

3815
04:14:10,090 --> 04:14:12,970
Well, we have extra ops, of course.

3816
04:14:18,240 --> 04:14:19,840
Actually, there is...

3817
04:14:21,100 --> 04:14:21,660
Cancel.

3818
04:14:26,500 --> 04:14:27,060
Let's...

3819
04:14:31,080 --> 04:14:31,640
Let's...

3820
04:14:31,640 --> 04:14:32,480
The game is over.

3821
04:14:32,620 --> 04:14:33,460
Stop playing.

3822
04:14:33,600 --> 04:14:34,900
Never be game over.

3823
04:14:35,820 --> 04:14:37,380
Like date with Paz.

3824
04:14:38,620 --> 04:14:39,740
Of course.

3825
04:14:44,720 --> 04:14:48,880
My first exposure to Metal Gear was seeing that part of Peace Walker.

3826
04:14:49,060 --> 04:14:50,220
And I could tell it was something special.

3827
04:14:50,220 --> 04:14:52,740
I'm glad I got to see it all the way through with you this time.

3828
04:14:52,800 --> 04:14:53,340
Thank you, Minto.

3829
04:14:54,440 --> 04:14:54,760
Next!

3830
04:14:54,760 --> 04:14:55,800
Thank you for the pig!

3831
04:14:57,240 --> 04:14:57,920
No, no, no, no, no.

3832
04:14:57,980 --> 04:14:58,700
Cancel, cancel, cancel.

3833
04:14:59,060 --> 04:14:59,380
Here we go.

3834
04:15:05,460 --> 04:15:08,800
Can't it be her last words?

3835
04:15:08,840 --> 04:15:11,460
Basically follow your orders and do your job like a soldier.

3836
04:15:15,960 --> 04:15:16,760
What do you mean?

3837
04:15:17,420 --> 04:15:18,000
What are you missing?

3838
04:15:20,920 --> 04:15:21,980
Triple skull rating.

3839
04:15:22,060 --> 04:15:27,120
I don't know if you guys have noticed, but the skulls on the side are the difficulty level.

3840
04:15:28,740 --> 04:15:29,460
Oh my god.

3841
04:15:29,520 --> 04:15:30,840
Wait, I don't think I'm ready for this.

3842
04:15:43,180 --> 04:15:45,220
I don't think I'm...

3843
04:15:48,620 --> 04:15:49,380
Sorry.

3844
04:15:51,280 --> 04:15:52,040
Sorry.

3845
04:15:52,640 --> 04:15:53,460
I'm okay.

3846
04:15:54,300 --> 04:15:55,220
I'm okay.

3847
04:15:55,740 --> 04:15:58,060
Alright, Snake, we gotta get you smelling nice.

3848
04:16:01,920 --> 04:16:03,200
Okay, I'm okay.

3849
04:16:04,360 --> 04:16:05,480
I'm okay.

3850
04:16:06,720 --> 04:16:07,760
I'm okay.

3851
04:16:10,840 --> 04:16:11,920
I'm okay.

3852
04:16:12,700 --> 04:16:13,700
I'm okay, I'm okay.

3853
04:16:19,200 --> 04:16:20,320
Everybody, it's our date.

3854
04:16:21,620 --> 04:16:23,460
It's time for our date with Buzz!

3855
04:16:32,360 --> 04:16:34,400
Look at the way he stares.

3856
04:16:40,160 --> 04:16:42,240
Look at her pretty little face.

3857
04:16:45,180 --> 04:16:45,620
Okay.

3858
04:16:46,060 --> 04:16:47,820
Alright, play it cool, play it cool, Snake.

3859
04:16:47,820 --> 04:16:49,380
Play it cool, play it cool, Snake.

3860
04:16:51,880 --> 04:16:53,080
Hello, Paws.

3861
04:16:59,740 --> 04:17:01,440
Maybe not these.

3862
04:17:03,000 --> 04:17:03,680
Rupee?

3863
04:17:04,200 --> 04:17:06,080
Oh, I didn't customize my things.

3864
04:17:08,940 --> 04:17:09,620
No,

3865
04:17:14,800 --> 04:17:15,960
now we're pulling out.

3866
04:17:26,760 --> 04:17:27,440
What?

3867
04:17:27,960 --> 04:17:29,320
Let's use our cologne.

3868
04:17:31,620 --> 04:17:33,320
I can't use my cologne!

3869
04:17:34,760 --> 04:17:35,440
Oh my god.

3870
04:17:36,080 --> 04:17:36,760
Oh my god.

3871
04:17:45,940 --> 04:17:47,520
She likes it.

3872
04:17:53,580 --> 04:17:54,260
Yeah!

3873
04:17:55,000 --> 04:18:02,700
What are you talking about?

3874
04:18:02,960 --> 04:18:04,140
Oh, she doesn't like that one.

3875
04:18:06,720 --> 04:18:07,060
Yeah!

3876
04:18:09,560 --> 04:18:11,160
Oh, sorry.

3877
04:18:11,500 --> 04:18:11,740
Sorry.

3878
04:18:13,360 --> 04:18:14,260
Let's equip.

3879
04:18:17,080 --> 04:18:17,760
Camera!

3880
04:18:22,360 --> 04:18:25,060
Can I get a nice one of you in the sunset?

3881
04:18:25,600 --> 04:18:26,480
Turn around.

3882
04:18:26,920 --> 04:18:27,960
Turn around, Paws.

3883
04:18:29,520 --> 04:18:30,000
Paws!

3884
04:18:30,500 --> 04:18:30,980
Paws!

3885
04:18:32,620 --> 04:18:33,980
Paws, look here, Paws.

3886
04:18:36,540 --> 04:18:37,620
She's so cute.

3887
04:18:38,840 --> 04:18:40,400
Wait, how do I... Can I zoom?

3888
04:18:43,360 --> 04:18:44,320
Oh, sorry.

3889
04:18:44,680 --> 04:18:44,840
Sorry.

3890
04:18:47,000 --> 04:18:48,980
You are going to take a picture of me?

3891
04:18:49,260 --> 04:18:49,640
Yeah, yeah.

3892
04:18:56,960 --> 04:18:58,180
Look how cute she is.

3893
04:18:58,540 --> 04:19:00,480
Look how cute she is!

3894
04:19:02,700 --> 04:19:03,600
Oh, sorry.

3895
04:19:03,880 --> 04:19:04,100
Sorry.

3896
04:19:04,260 --> 04:19:05,040
No, no, no, no.

3897
04:19:05,200 --> 04:19:05,800
I'm messing it up.

3898
04:19:05,860 --> 04:19:06,400
I'm messing it up.

3899
04:19:08,400 --> 04:19:08,800
Go!

3900
04:19:16,700 --> 04:19:18,200
I'm not impressing her anymore.

3901
04:19:20,320 --> 04:19:20,720
Peace!

3902
04:19:21,320 --> 04:19:21,720
Peace!

3903
04:19:21,720 --> 04:19:22,500
Peace!

3904
04:19:23,480 --> 04:19:23,940
Peace!

3905
04:19:24,740 --> 04:19:25,200
Peace!

3906
04:19:29,800 --> 04:19:31,600
She has nothing to say about that one.

3907
04:19:31,660 --> 04:19:32,820
I wouldn't either, to be honest.

3908
04:19:46,760 --> 04:19:49,520
She's like, what the hell are you talking about?

3909
04:19:51,040 --> 04:19:53,900
Well, I don't think we're gonna get so far in this one, you guys.

3910
04:19:54,040 --> 04:19:56,640
But, she might meow back if you try it again.

3911
04:20:02,580 --> 04:20:04,100
Hey, can you... Can you...

3912
04:20:04,100 --> 04:20:05,180
Alright, here we go, guys.

3913
04:20:08,860 --> 04:20:10,620
You are going to take a picture of me?

3914
04:20:12,620 --> 04:20:13,820
Why am I so big?

3915
04:20:14,200 --> 04:20:15,180
Why am I so big?

3916
04:20:15,300 --> 04:20:17,560
Oh my gosh, here we go.

3917
04:20:17,880 --> 04:20:18,520
Oh my god.

3918
04:20:18,760 --> 04:20:21,460
I'm gonna do the photographer thing where you get on the ground, you know?

3919
04:20:21,460 --> 04:20:22,640
Oh, but I have to step back.

3920
04:20:23,460 --> 04:20:24,580
Okay, there we go.

3921
04:20:24,620 --> 04:20:24,960
There we go.

3922
04:20:25,260 --> 04:20:26,240
Yeah, keep twirling.

3923
04:20:26,540 --> 04:20:27,440
Keep twirling.

3924
04:20:27,560 --> 04:20:29,060
You are so cute.

3925
04:20:29,580 --> 04:20:30,580
Keep twirling.

3926
04:20:31,000 --> 04:20:31,980
Keep twirling.

3927
04:20:34,000 --> 04:20:34,440
Yes!

3928
04:20:34,960 --> 04:20:36,320
I'm getting your best angles.

3929
04:20:36,440 --> 04:20:37,040
What's wrong with me?

3930
04:20:37,220 --> 04:20:38,960
Oh, I'm running into the scarecrow.

3931
04:20:49,140 --> 04:20:51,920
Look how cute she was running up to me!

3932
04:20:55,360 --> 04:20:56,380
Oh my god.

3933
04:20:56,640 --> 04:20:58,340
She's such...

3934
04:20:58,340 --> 04:20:59,720
She's such a natural.

3935
04:21:03,140 --> 04:21:06,040
Would you like to listen to some music?

3936
04:21:10,300 --> 04:21:13,020
How do I... Actually, how do I scroll through it?

3937
04:21:16,020 --> 04:21:16,840
No, no, no.

3938
04:21:16,920 --> 04:21:17,220
Stop.

3939
04:21:17,760 --> 04:21:18,700
How do I scroll through it?

3940
04:21:21,820 --> 04:21:22,300
Eh?

3941
04:21:23,640 --> 04:21:23,740
Eh?

3942
04:21:24,040 --> 04:21:24,120
Eh?

3943
04:21:29,510 --> 04:21:30,330
D-pad?

3944
04:21:30,470 --> 04:21:31,570
No, D-pad is not working.

3945
04:21:31,690 --> 04:21:32,190
X and B?

3946
04:21:32,530 --> 04:21:34,110
No, let's play and...

3947
04:21:35,070 --> 04:21:36,330
Well, maybe Y and A.

3948
04:21:36,410 --> 04:21:37,110
Maybe I'm...

3949
04:21:37,930 --> 04:21:40,110
No, those are blacked out, so no.

3950
04:21:42,070 --> 04:21:44,090
You have to upgrade to unlock scrolling?

3951
04:21:44,230 --> 04:21:45,010
No way!

3952
04:21:47,070 --> 04:21:48,430
It's so cheap.

3953
04:21:49,490 --> 04:21:50,810
Okay, next time, pause.

3954
04:21:51,050 --> 04:21:52,930
Next time, we'll listen to some really great tunes.

3955
04:21:52,930 --> 04:21:54,410
Oh, my bad.

3956
04:21:54,490 --> 04:21:54,650
Sorry.

3957
04:21:59,930 --> 04:22:00,810
Needed items.

3958
04:22:00,930 --> 04:22:02,150
Something Paz would like.

3959
04:22:02,410 --> 04:22:03,970
Does she like...

3960
04:22:05,230 --> 04:22:07,350
Does she like...

3961
04:22:09,550 --> 04:22:10,110
Curry?

3962
04:22:17,230 --> 04:22:17,890
Do you like this?

3963
04:22:24,430 --> 04:22:25,630
Maybe closer to her.

3964
04:22:26,570 --> 04:22:27,130
No!

3965
04:22:29,330 --> 04:22:30,070
I'm sorry!

3966
04:22:30,990 --> 04:22:31,850
You want the curry?

3967
04:22:31,850 --> 04:22:31,950
Curry!

3968
04:22:33,470 --> 04:22:35,090
You're the one running up to me.

3969
04:22:37,830 --> 04:22:39,990
Okay, let's just try it.

3970
04:22:41,730 --> 04:22:43,050
Room for one more?

3971
04:23:15,780 --> 04:23:18,720
We have to have other things that Paz likes.

3972
04:23:18,720 --> 04:23:20,660
I have to...

3973
04:23:20,660 --> 04:23:22,720
I didn't equip...

3974
04:23:25,080 --> 04:23:26,960
Huey jumpscare.

3975
04:23:27,200 --> 04:23:27,620
Oh my god.

3976
04:24:12,940 --> 04:24:14,080
Glad to hear it.

3977
04:24:14,120 --> 04:24:14,600
Glad to hear it.

3978
04:24:21,580 --> 04:24:22,960
That was cool.

3979
04:24:23,040 --> 04:24:23,300
Okay!

3980
04:24:24,840 --> 04:24:26,160
Don't do that.

3981
04:24:27,160 --> 04:24:28,680
I think that would be...

3982
04:24:29,800 --> 04:24:30,960
pretty bad.

3983
04:24:31,880 --> 04:24:34,120
I think that wouldn't be so great.

3984
04:24:35,380 --> 04:24:38,200
I think this is already a bad idea to begin with.

3985
04:24:40,020 --> 04:24:41,180
And now...

3986
04:24:41,180 --> 04:24:42,840
we have...

3987
04:24:42,840 --> 04:24:43,520
Metal Gear!

3988
04:24:46,560 --> 04:24:48,120
Well, I have like...

3989
04:24:48,120 --> 04:24:48,520
Look!

3990
04:24:48,740 --> 04:24:49,360
Oh wait.

3991
04:24:49,500 --> 04:24:50,060
Hold on.

3992
04:24:50,160 --> 04:24:50,400
Look!

3993
04:24:50,860 --> 04:24:51,120
Look!

3994
04:24:51,440 --> 04:24:51,860
Look!

3995
04:24:53,340 --> 04:24:54,480
Nothing there.

3996
04:24:58,980 --> 04:25:02,500
This is... What's that one story?

3997
04:25:03,540 --> 04:25:08,300
About the guy that swindles the king into buying invisible clothes and he's just naked?

3998
04:25:10,260 --> 04:25:13,780
Metal Gear... That's literally what's happening right here.

3999
04:25:17,160 --> 04:25:19,680
Our main parts... We got like nothing.

4000
04:25:20,680 --> 04:25:23,020
We have nothing, you guys.

4001
04:25:23,900 --> 04:25:24,140
Wait?

4002
04:25:26,740 --> 04:25:27,580
No...

4003
04:25:27,580 --> 04:25:28,940
Nothing.

4004
04:25:30,160 --> 04:25:31,000
Nothing.

4005
04:25:31,860 --> 04:25:33,000
Emperor's new clothes.

4006
04:25:33,080 --> 04:25:33,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4007
04:25:40,420 --> 04:25:40,940
Yeah.

4008
04:25:40,940 --> 04:25:42,180
Yeah, mine has stealth camo.

4009
04:25:42,280 --> 04:25:43,680
I'm so far advanced.

4010
04:25:44,580 --> 04:25:45,580
Sorry, I know.

4011
04:25:45,640 --> 04:25:48,180
It's like so, so cool, right?

4012
04:25:48,880 --> 04:25:50,920
Wait, I'm gonna upgrade the Walkman.

4013
04:25:54,680 --> 04:25:56,700
We have so much GMP now.

4014
04:26:04,580 --> 04:26:05,180
Yeah.

4015
04:26:08,340 --> 04:26:09,540
Nothing here.

4016
04:26:13,260 --> 04:26:15,780
Oh my gosh, wasn't the...

4017
04:26:16,680 --> 04:26:18,300
Wasn't the date so great?

4018
04:26:19,020 --> 04:26:22,160
Now guys, there is one last thing I wanna do.

4019
04:26:23,320 --> 04:26:24,480
Before we end for today.

4020
04:26:27,860 --> 04:26:30,100
I don't think I have it though.

4021
04:26:33,000 --> 04:26:34,000
Oh, there it is.

4022
04:26:34,020 --> 04:26:35,140
The Snake Gear Retrieval.

4023
04:26:36,100 --> 04:26:39,580
The one thing I wanted to do...

4024
04:26:43,080 --> 04:26:43,760
This... Wait.

4025
04:26:45,040 --> 04:26:48,680
First of all, I'm just gonna say...

4026
04:26:48,680 --> 04:26:50,720
It's not a spoiler, but...

4027
04:26:51,280 --> 04:26:54,380
Do you guys remember what I have to... If anybody has played this game...

4028
04:26:54,380 --> 04:26:58,340
Do you remember what I have to do to get the spooky mission?

4029
04:26:58,940 --> 04:26:59,740
Spooky mission?

4030
04:27:04,720 --> 04:27:06,120
You guys, stop it.

4031
04:27:06,200 --> 04:27:08,140
I already have plans for the Monster Hunter.

4032
04:27:08,500 --> 04:27:11,840
I'm gonna

4033
04:27:17,050 --> 04:27:17,730
look it up.

4034
04:27:18,910 --> 04:27:19,910
I'm gonna look it up.

4035
04:27:20,090 --> 04:27:20,730
What do I have to do?

4036
04:27:23,340 --> 04:27:24,300
Spooky mission.

4037
04:27:34,560 --> 04:27:36,100
How do I get it?

4038
04:27:45,640 --> 04:27:47,540
Maybe I need to do more extra.

4039
04:27:47,960 --> 04:27:48,260
Maybe.

4040
04:27:48,720 --> 04:27:50,260
I might have to finish the earlier ones.

4041
04:27:50,380 --> 04:27:50,860
OK, maybe.

4042
04:27:59,200 --> 04:28:00,400
Now the unlock order.

4043
04:28:00,540 --> 04:28:00,700
OK.

4044
04:28:01,040 --> 04:28:01,980
We'll do other missions.

4045
04:28:03,040 --> 04:28:03,360
Wait.

4046
04:28:03,480 --> 04:28:03,880
No, no, no.

4047
04:28:04,940 --> 04:28:06,700
Then I'm just gonna...

4048
04:28:07,300 --> 04:28:08,360
I'm not gonna do this.

4049
04:28:09,640 --> 04:28:10,140
No, we're not.

4050
04:28:10,840 --> 04:28:11,960
I'm not gonna do this.

4051
04:28:12,020 --> 04:28:13,940
I'm just going into the briefing files.

4052
04:28:17,460 --> 04:28:17,860
Chica...

4053
04:28:21,660 --> 04:28:22,340
Chica...

4054
04:28:22,340 --> 04:28:23,940
Is it this one or the Legend?

4055
04:28:25,580 --> 04:28:28,800
Chica... Let's do the Isle first.

4056
04:28:35,260 --> 04:28:44,080
Is it the Uma one?

4057
04:28:47,880 --> 04:28:49,780
I remember reading that.

4058
04:28:53,680 --> 04:28:58,780
OK, there's a couple that I don't want to watch anymore.

4059
04:29:08,420 --> 04:29:10,040
It's been an honor by your side.

4060
04:29:11,220 --> 04:29:12,100
Thank you!

4061
04:29:15,300 --> 04:29:17,020
Thank you!

4062
04:29:17,020 --> 04:29:17,800
Thank you so much!

4063
04:29:29,120 --> 04:29:31,080
Talking cat, huh?

4064
04:29:44,860 --> 04:29:46,560
2001 Space Odyssey.

4065
04:29:52,200 --> 04:29:53,360
I'm looking for it.

4066
04:29:54,880 --> 04:29:56,700
I might have to unlock it.

4067
04:30:08,680 --> 04:30:09,880
Thank you!

4068
04:30:24,460 --> 04:30:26,980
Thank you!

4069
04:30:50,220 --> 04:30:53,020
Thank you!

4070
04:31:05,970 --> 04:31:08,130
It was a mistake.

4071
04:31:08,350 --> 04:31:12,770
Canonically believes in Santa Claus and I'm just obsessed with that fact.

4072
04:31:13,870 --> 04:31:14,350
OK.

4073
04:31:15,170 --> 04:31:16,990
So wait, so extra ops... What was it?

4074
04:31:17,030 --> 04:31:17,410
29?

4075
04:31:21,790 --> 04:31:22,270
Wait...

4076
04:31:24,800 --> 04:31:25,900
Chiquita, what was it again?

4077
04:31:28,560 --> 04:31:32,680
Scrolling, I'm scrolling, I'm scrolling, I'm scrolling, I'm scrolling, I'm scrolling, I'm scrolling, I'm scrolling...

4078
04:31:36,660 --> 04:31:37,660
Yep, OK.

4079
04:31:39,000 --> 04:31:40,900
Oh, only I can do this one.

4080
04:31:41,000 --> 04:31:41,600
No!

4081
04:31:42,860 --> 04:31:43,760
How lonely.

4082
04:31:44,980 --> 04:31:46,080
Single player only.

4083
04:31:48,500 --> 04:31:49,880
It's 29.

4084
04:31:50,380 --> 04:31:50,580
OK.

4085
04:31:54,560 --> 04:31:56,560
Single player only.

4086
04:31:58,660 --> 04:31:59,460
So lonely.

4087
04:32:00,280 --> 04:32:01,540
OK, I have C4 already.

4088
04:32:01,540 --> 04:32:01,580
OK.

4089
04:32:08,840 --> 04:32:13,800
Actually, before we go, before I end today, I do want to do the Monster Hunter fight.

4090
04:32:18,220 --> 04:32:19,260
So that's...

4091
04:32:19,260 --> 04:32:20,600
The plan.

4092
04:32:22,980 --> 04:32:24,160
Don't get lost?

4093
04:32:24,160 --> 04:32:24,220
Yes.

4094
04:32:29,510 --> 04:32:30,010
Freeze.

4095
04:32:41,990 --> 04:32:44,790
Holy moly.

4096
04:32:47,890 --> 04:32:49,870
That was so... close.

4097
04:32:59,770 --> 04:33:00,470
Freeze.

4098
04:33:02,550 --> 04:33:03,750
Get on the ground.

4099
04:33:04,450 --> 04:33:06,610
Get on the ground.

4100
04:33:07,010 --> 04:33:09,670
These guys might suck, but I don't care.

4101
04:33:11,310 --> 04:33:13,410
I'm gonna take them home anyway.

4102
04:33:17,590 --> 04:33:18,150
Beep, beep.

4103
04:33:19,490 --> 04:33:20,750
Now I feel sad.

4104
04:33:20,830 --> 04:33:21,230
Wait, what?

4105
04:33:27,320 --> 04:33:28,680
Very good.

4106
04:33:31,140 --> 04:33:31,600
OK.

4107
04:33:37,380 --> 04:33:40,800
The boss used to have the N dress up as Santa, I bet.

4108
04:33:41,600 --> 04:33:43,640
Don't say that!

4109
04:33:47,040 --> 04:33:53,220
Knightly Liquid never got any Christmas presents because Big Boss thought Santa would do it and just assumed he was a bad child.

4110
04:33:54,640 --> 04:33:57,820
That's why he's such a little D-bag.

4111
04:33:59,280 --> 04:34:00,820
He's such a stinking weenie.

4112
04:34:02,860 --> 04:34:05,060
Because of that.

4113
04:34:12,420 --> 04:34:15,660
Oh it's begun!

4114
04:34:16,460 --> 04:34:17,760
It's begun!

4115
04:34:21,120 --> 04:34:21,820
No!

4116
04:34:29,880 --> 04:34:31,660
OK, so for anybody...

4117
04:34:37,900 --> 04:34:42,660
For those who don't know...

4118
04:34:47,160 --> 04:34:47,840
Zadornov...

4119
04:34:51,040 --> 04:34:54,700
There's like a bajillion... It's Endless Eight with Zadornov.

4120
04:34:56,680 --> 04:35:02,700
There are so many missions of him escaping, it's actually stupid.

4121
04:35:03,220 --> 04:35:05,500
It's the worst part about the game, honestly.

4122
04:35:08,680 --> 04:35:09,520
Beep, beep.

4123
04:35:09,520 --> 04:35:14,520
It is quite honestly the worst part about the game, but...

4124
04:35:17,500 --> 04:35:18,300
You can go.

4125
04:35:20,200 --> 04:35:21,380
You can leave.

4126
04:35:27,020 --> 04:35:29,680
But yeah, so...

4127
04:35:29,680 --> 04:35:31,280
We're gonna have to go through those.

4128
04:35:31,700 --> 04:35:33,680
There is a bit more of the game left!

4129
04:35:33,760 --> 04:35:34,000
Surprise!

4130
04:35:35,900 --> 04:35:37,220
Surprise, there's more of the game!

4131
04:35:38,900 --> 04:35:39,340
Surprise!

4132
04:35:40,740 --> 04:35:41,180
Surprise.

4133
04:35:43,060 --> 04:35:44,540
But we're not gonna do this today.

4134
04:35:47,200 --> 04:35:48,900
We are not gonna do that today.

4135
04:35:49,700 --> 04:35:51,220
Wait, so then I do...

4136
04:35:52,040 --> 04:35:54,020
Item capture 29 again?

4137
04:36:03,060 --> 04:36:04,060
Date with pause.

4138
04:36:08,860 --> 04:36:10,500
This time blow it up and go to the beach.

4139
04:36:10,940 --> 04:36:11,120
OK.

4140
04:36:12,120 --> 04:36:13,040
Ah, that's right!

4141
04:36:13,400 --> 04:36:14,200
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4142
04:36:18,040 --> 04:36:19,280
That's where we see him.

4143
04:36:19,460 --> 04:36:20,360
We see the little cat.

4144
04:36:20,780 --> 04:36:21,220
Alright, cool.

4145
04:36:21,300 --> 04:36:21,900
Thank you.

4146
04:36:23,820 --> 04:36:24,520
We're done.

4147
04:36:26,160 --> 04:36:27,360
Gotta go to the dock.

4148
04:36:27,560 --> 04:36:27,680
OK.

4149
04:36:28,980 --> 04:36:29,960
Blow it up and go.

4150
04:36:30,280 --> 04:36:30,480
Alright.

4151
04:36:31,780 --> 04:36:32,580
Nice, nice, nice.

4152
04:36:36,430 --> 04:36:37,390
Calico time.

4153
04:36:39,530 --> 04:36:40,410
Where is it?

4154
04:36:40,770 --> 04:36:41,010
OK.

4155
04:36:42,190 --> 04:36:43,170
Wait, it's over there.

4156
04:36:45,170 --> 04:36:46,530
It's the exclamation point.

4157
04:37:03,720 --> 04:37:04,260
Freeze.

4158
04:37:05,120 --> 04:37:05,800
Get down.

4159
04:37:13,100 --> 04:37:14,360
What is behind me?

4160
04:37:14,460 --> 04:37:15,260
Wait, which one is it?

4161
04:37:17,680 --> 04:37:19,340
Oh, why did I do that?

4162
04:37:19,660 --> 04:37:20,700
I'm so dumb.

4163
04:37:25,480 --> 04:37:27,360
I wish I could pick this up.

4164
04:37:28,340 --> 04:37:28,740
My bad.

4165
04:37:34,020 --> 04:37:34,400
Yippee!

4166
04:37:39,940 --> 04:37:40,320
Wait.

4167
04:37:42,740 --> 04:37:45,140
So it's not the... Wait, I'm lost.

4168
04:37:46,300 --> 04:37:47,120
Wait, where am I?

4169
04:37:56,560 --> 04:37:57,720
Go to the beach.

4170
04:37:57,840 --> 04:37:59,680
You guys, I don't know which way is the beach.

4171
04:38:00,700 --> 04:38:01,520
To the beach?

4172
04:38:01,600 --> 04:38:02,040
What do you mean?

4173
04:38:02,200 --> 04:38:03,100
The play button.

4174
04:38:03,220 --> 04:38:03,800
OK, let's see.

4175
04:38:03,800 --> 04:38:06,820
That makes more sense than just the beach.

4176
04:38:07,800 --> 04:38:10,680
It doesn't say... Ah, this way is to the beach.

4177
04:38:14,900 --> 04:38:15,580
OK,

4178
04:38:18,840 --> 04:38:20,960
there we go.

4179
04:38:26,180 --> 04:38:27,680
I love the beach.

4180
04:38:31,410 --> 04:38:32,090
And...

4181
04:38:32,090 --> 04:38:32,190
Oh?

4182
04:38:33,990 --> 04:38:34,550
Wait.

4183
04:38:40,680 --> 04:38:42,040
What did I do wrong?

4184
04:38:51,500 --> 04:38:52,760
Where is he?

4185
04:38:59,020 --> 04:39:01,600
Maybe it was the Uma dialogue after all.

4186
04:39:15,720 --> 04:39:18,320
I have to listen to all of Chico's tapes?

4187
04:39:19,180 --> 04:39:20,160
Oh man.

4188
04:39:20,920 --> 04:39:22,840
OK, maybe we will do it next time then.

4189
04:39:31,840 --> 04:39:33,300
Maybe we will do it next time.

4190
04:39:35,140 --> 04:39:38,200
There is still quite a bit to do, so...

4191
04:39:43,380 --> 04:39:45,060
Extra Ops 29 complete.

4192
04:39:46,900 --> 04:39:48,800
It explains why I never found the Monster Hunter stuff.

4193
04:39:49,340 --> 04:39:52,400
I did it before, it's just I can't remember how I did it before.

4194
04:39:53,280 --> 04:39:58,400
So these games are so specific in what you have to do sometimes, you know?

4195
04:39:59,400 --> 04:40:01,700
Is it all of them for real?

4196
04:40:02,340 --> 04:40:03,980
Did I just skip through them?

4197
04:40:08,580 --> 04:40:10,820
Why do you say it like that?

4198
04:40:11,680 --> 04:40:12,280
Package?

4199
04:40:29,060 --> 04:40:30,460
Oh?

4200
04:40:38,820 --> 04:40:40,220
Eva...Eva...

4201
04:40:47,360 --> 04:40:50,300
What is it?

4202
04:40:50,340 --> 04:40:51,180
Under items?

4203
04:40:51,880 --> 04:40:53,000
Or...

4204
04:40:53,000 --> 04:40:53,300
Other?

4205
04:41:01,050 --> 04:41:02,530
Is it actually under the tapes?

4206
04:41:16,520 --> 04:41:17,400
Data files?

4207
04:41:17,580 --> 04:41:18,440
Oh, a message from Eva.

4208
04:41:20,760 --> 04:41:21,640
Holy moly!

4209
04:41:21,800 --> 04:41:22,840
She's got a lot to say.

4210
04:41:25,500 --> 04:41:26,960
Oh my god.

4211
04:41:27,440 --> 04:41:28,700
Oh, wait.

4212
04:41:29,180 --> 04:41:30,000
I think I remember this.

4213
04:41:31,820 --> 04:41:32,700
Thank you!

4214
04:41:43,640 --> 04:41:44,080
Okay.

4215
04:41:45,940 --> 04:41:47,740
I think I am done for today though.

4216
04:41:48,800 --> 04:41:49,500
What time is it?

4217
04:41:49,660 --> 04:41:50,260
Holy cow!

4218
04:41:50,560 --> 04:41:51,680
How long have I been...

4219
04:41:52,620 --> 04:41:54,500
Oh wow, it's almost been 5 hours.

4220
04:41:54,500 --> 04:42:00,800
Wow, but we beat like the first part of Peace Walker, so...

4221
04:42:00,800 --> 04:42:03,420
Good job everybody, good job team, good job team!

4222
04:42:05,240 --> 04:42:06,660
Oh, I'm big again.

4223
04:42:07,080 --> 04:42:10,420
I always play in release order, not chronological order.

4224
04:42:11,920 --> 04:42:12,380
Yeah, yeah.

4225
04:42:15,220 --> 04:42:17,120
Good job team, good job, good job!

4226
04:42:19,760 --> 04:42:22,820
So yeah, there's still quite a bit to go through.

4227
04:42:22,820 --> 04:42:26,460
If you couldn't tell, I barely touched the...

4228
04:42:27,160 --> 04:42:30,560
I barely touched the codec, the little tapes.

4229
04:42:30,680 --> 04:42:31,520
I call them codecs.

4230
04:42:31,660 --> 04:42:32,440
The codec tapes.

4231
04:42:32,740 --> 04:42:34,540
The information thingies.

4232
04:42:36,840 --> 04:42:38,860
We gotta get those Umas.

4233
04:42:39,260 --> 04:42:42,600
I like how this is like extra important and I didn't even touch it.

4234
04:42:42,680 --> 04:42:43,200
It's okay though.

4235
04:42:47,280 --> 04:42:49,620
But yeah, this was fun!

4236
04:42:49,720 --> 04:42:50,420
Fun, fun, fun.

4237
04:42:50,420 --> 04:42:52,040
Thank you guys!

4238
04:42:54,240 --> 04:42:57,400
Oh gosh, maybe we should grab Zdornov while I'm here.

4239
04:42:57,820 --> 04:43:00,420
So that when I do other stuff off stream...

4240
04:43:01,480 --> 04:43:03,660
He'll be available for next time.

4241
04:43:04,460 --> 04:43:05,220
Vic, me too!

4242
04:43:06,180 --> 04:43:07,340
Do we wanna do one last battle?

4243
04:43:07,620 --> 04:43:08,640
One last thing?

4244
04:43:11,100 --> 04:43:12,900
One last Zdornov search?

4245
04:43:17,020 --> 04:43:17,540
Zdornov...

4246
04:43:18,940 --> 04:43:20,780
Come on in, anybody who wants to join.

4247
04:43:21,180 --> 04:43:22,610
Unless you turned off your game...

4248
04:43:23,440 --> 04:43:24,520
Turned off your console by now?

4249
04:43:24,600 --> 04:43:25,300
Nope, you didn't.

4250
04:43:25,380 --> 04:43:25,960
Hello, Micmac.

4251
04:43:27,480 --> 04:43:28,280
Yeah, we're good.

4252
04:43:31,500 --> 04:43:32,540
Yeah, shouldn't be too hard.

4253
04:43:33,300 --> 04:43:37,320
He is just such a pain in the butt, this guy, for real.

4254
04:43:38,200 --> 04:43:39,980
He is so stinkin' annoying.

4255
04:43:44,180 --> 04:43:45,200
But we'll get him.

4256
04:43:48,080 --> 04:43:50,040
I'm happy to grind off stream with you too.

4257
04:43:50,260 --> 04:43:52,340
I might post on Twitter and be like...

4258
04:43:52,340 --> 04:43:55,400
Hey guys, I'm doing extra ops.

4259
04:43:56,020 --> 04:43:56,960
Anybody wanna join?

4260
04:44:00,360 --> 04:44:03,300
But maybe, I don't know, maybe next week will be the last.

4261
04:44:03,440 --> 04:44:07,640
I don't remember actually how much more we have.

4262
04:44:07,920 --> 04:44:09,200
I know it's like...

4263
04:44:10,460 --> 04:44:12,660
Obviously I wanna get a date with Kaz.

4264
04:44:12,660 --> 04:44:15,200
Because yes, there is a date with Kaz.

4265
04:44:18,120 --> 04:44:18,560
And...

4266
04:44:18,560 --> 04:44:20,940
We're in Chapter 5, Outer Heaven.

4267
04:44:23,200 --> 04:44:24,260
It's a lot of grind.

4268
04:44:24,300 --> 04:44:26,580
It is a lot of grinding, I do remember that.

4269
04:44:26,660 --> 04:44:29,660
I do remember having before... having to do stuff.

4270
04:44:31,340 --> 04:44:35,100
Don't be a stranger if you ever wanna waste extra ops grind stream.

4271
04:44:35,300 --> 04:44:36,840
Membu... Yeah, maybe Membu.

4272
04:44:37,680 --> 04:44:38,380
I don't know.

4273
04:44:39,300 --> 04:44:40,120
Maybe we'll do Membu.

4274
04:44:41,120 --> 04:44:42,300
Hello!

4275
04:44:46,080 --> 04:44:48,320
Okay, okay.

4276
04:44:52,800 --> 04:44:55,760
On the ground with your soldier.

4277
04:44:56,920 --> 04:44:58,080
Thanks.

4278
04:44:58,380 --> 04:44:59,400
Where is this guy anyway?

4279
04:45:02,460 --> 04:45:03,640
This way?

4280
04:45:09,120 --> 04:45:10,220
The hay bale.

4281
04:45:10,720 --> 04:45:12,620
I want the hay bale.

4282
04:45:15,300 --> 04:45:17,040
I want the hay bale.

4283
04:45:19,900 --> 04:45:21,740
I love playing this game though.

4284
04:45:21,780 --> 04:45:22,520
It's so fun.

4285
04:45:27,680 --> 04:45:28,200
Zadornov!

4286
04:45:30,920 --> 04:45:31,440
Zadornov!

4287
04:45:32,000 --> 04:45:33,040
Wait, is there a guy up here?

4288
04:45:37,460 --> 04:45:38,600
Who noticed me?

4289
04:45:40,360 --> 04:45:41,720
How did they notice?

4290
04:45:42,040 --> 04:45:42,720
Who noticed?

4291
04:45:45,160 --> 04:45:46,320
Wait, how did they notice?

4292
04:45:51,680 --> 04:45:52,880
No backup!

4293
04:45:56,000 --> 04:45:57,440
No reinforcements?

4294
04:46:00,440 --> 04:46:01,160
Stupid!

4295
04:46:01,160 --> 04:46:01,380
Stupid!

4296
04:46:06,620 --> 04:46:07,580
Look at this guy.

4297
04:46:07,680 --> 04:46:08,980
He doesn't know what's going on.

4298
04:46:12,120 --> 04:46:13,240
Come here!

4299
04:46:17,680 --> 04:46:18,380
Where is he?

4300
04:46:20,240 --> 04:46:21,800
You're gonna regret this!

4301
04:46:26,820 --> 04:46:28,540
Is he around here?

4302
04:46:29,520 --> 04:46:30,700
Do you know where he is at?

4303
04:46:30,700 --> 04:46:33,060
Is he inside this house?

4304
04:46:35,660 --> 04:46:36,420
Zadornov!

4305
04:46:37,480 --> 04:46:44,200
What did

4306
04:46:49,600 --> 04:46:52,100
you do to him?

4307
04:47:00,990 --> 04:47:02,370
What did you do to him?

4308
04:47:04,850 --> 04:47:06,870
We made it!

4309
04:47:09,710 --> 04:47:11,790
It was so silly!

4310
04:47:14,710 --> 04:47:16,810
That was actually so...

4311
04:47:20,200 --> 04:47:21,080
One second.

4312
04:47:21,340 --> 04:47:21,800
There we go.

4313
04:47:23,100 --> 04:47:24,520
If it works, it works.

4314
04:47:29,750 --> 04:47:34,010
I think we would have gotten an S if it wasn't for the alert phase.

4315
04:47:34,290 --> 04:47:35,150
Somebody triggered.

4316
04:47:37,310 --> 04:47:39,410
I'll give him something to shoot at.

4317
04:47:41,530 --> 04:47:43,970
Nice, so that's our first time finding him.

4318
04:47:57,410 --> 04:47:59,910
Who gave this guy a radio anyway?

4319
04:48:00,250 --> 04:48:03,250
Oh my god, the way he's like crouched in the corner.

4320
04:48:05,590 --> 04:48:07,690
This game is so funny!

4321
04:48:10,950 --> 04:48:14,150
I love it, I love it, I love it.

4322
04:48:23,850 --> 04:48:27,390
So next time we'll grind a little bit more.

4323
04:48:29,610 --> 04:48:31,070
I might grind off stream.

4324
04:48:33,070 --> 04:48:33,870
We'll see.

4325
04:48:34,590 --> 04:48:36,570
I want to do Monster Hunter next time.

4326
04:48:37,090 --> 04:48:38,070
I want to do...

4327
04:48:40,570 --> 04:48:44,070
I'll probably try and do a bunch of stuff off stream so that...

4328
04:48:44,890 --> 04:48:47,410
Next time, it's all set up.

4329
04:48:47,670 --> 04:48:48,230
You know what I mean?

4330
04:48:51,810 --> 04:48:52,850
Still more game.

4331
04:48:52,910 --> 04:48:55,750
There's still more more game, you guys.

4332
04:48:59,210 --> 04:49:01,110
There's still more more game.

4333
04:49:01,730 --> 04:49:03,750
More more story even, so...

4334
04:49:05,210 --> 04:49:07,410
It's not over yet, but yeah.

4335
04:49:09,930 --> 04:49:13,550
Thank you guys for peace walking with me today.

4336
04:49:14,110 --> 04:49:16,290
I had a lot of fun, I hope you guys did too.

4337
04:49:20,030 --> 04:49:23,670
Sorry I'm chewing, because I'm kind of hungry.

4338
04:49:26,750 --> 04:49:31,510
You have to beat all the AI battles to get gods.

4339
04:49:33,050 --> 04:49:34,270
Yes, yes.

4340
04:49:35,730 --> 04:49:36,950
Yes, I do remember.

4341
04:49:37,730 --> 04:49:40,170
So I will require assistance with those.

4342
04:49:42,770 --> 04:49:44,130
These bad boys.

4343
04:49:50,410 --> 04:49:53,990
I'll never forget I was gaslit into thinking that...

4344
04:49:55,750 --> 04:49:59,250
I had to get S rank on Date With Paws, but that was not the case at all.

4345
04:50:01,650 --> 04:50:02,050
Wait.

4346
04:50:02,510 --> 04:50:02,890
Oh.

4347
04:50:04,430 --> 04:50:05,650
It's not Main Ops.

4348
04:50:06,590 --> 04:50:07,370
Where are they?

4349
04:50:13,680 --> 04:50:14,080
Wait.

4350
04:50:14,620 --> 04:50:15,480
Is it Main Ops?

4351
04:50:17,420 --> 04:50:18,600
All the vehicle battles?

4352
04:50:19,080 --> 04:50:19,320
Oh.

4353
04:50:19,940 --> 04:50:21,240
I thought it was the big battles.

4354
04:50:23,580 --> 04:50:24,860
I just reached this part today.

4355
04:50:24,960 --> 04:50:25,740
Anyway, I've got to go to work.

4356
04:50:25,780 --> 04:50:26,640
See you tomorrow.

4357
04:50:26,640 --> 04:50:27,620
I just reached this part.

4358
04:50:27,920 --> 04:50:29,700
Oh, you copied it twice!

4359
04:50:30,500 --> 04:50:32,020
Good luck with the work, Kamibara!

4360
04:50:32,240 --> 04:50:33,920
We're ending anyway, so...

4361
04:50:33,920 --> 04:50:34,920
After the doorknob.

4362
04:50:35,820 --> 04:50:37,000
Oh, I need to unlock more of them.

4363
04:50:37,180 --> 04:50:38,240
Yeah, we will.

4364
04:50:38,440 --> 04:50:41,560
Because we will keep getting the doorknob missions, of course.

4365
04:50:42,480 --> 04:50:46,220
There's a lot of grinding after this part, but we'll get through it.

4366
04:50:46,720 --> 04:50:48,160
No worries at all.

4367
04:50:49,360 --> 04:50:50,320
Thank you guys.

4368
04:50:50,700 --> 04:50:53,540
I hope you guys have a good rest of your Saturday.

4369
04:50:53,540 --> 04:50:54,960
Or Sunday, maybe.

4370
04:50:55,060 --> 04:50:56,020
Whatever time it is for you.

4371
04:50:59,200 --> 04:51:00,220
Have a good day.

4372
04:51:00,260 --> 04:51:00,620
Have a good night.

4373
04:51:00,700 --> 04:51:02,220
And I'll see you guys later.

4374
04:51:02,560 --> 04:51:07,920
Thank you so much for getting through that emotional, beautiful part of Peace Walker.

4375
04:51:08,060 --> 04:51:09,160
I love Peace Walker so much.

4376
04:51:11,480 --> 04:51:13,020
Thank you so much for the gift.

4377
04:51:13,220 --> 04:51:13,840
Thank you!

4378
04:51:15,000 --> 04:51:15,720
Bye bye!
