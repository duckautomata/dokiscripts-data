1
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,830
Welcome back, Master.

2
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,470
Master.

3
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,110
Lady.

4
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,570
It's night time.

5
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,250
I don't think we should hike at night, though.

6
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,510
Jolly Rammer, it's your birthday!

7
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,690
Please don't sing if your throat is sore.

8
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,070
Thank you, Mintoa Whisper, for making this year so unforgettable.

9
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,230
I wrote that as uncomfortable.

10
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,570
Thanks, everybody, for making this year so uncomfortable.

11
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,850
Jolly Rammer, enjoy!

12
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,750
Happy birthday to you.

13
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,070
Happy birthday to you.

14
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,150
Happy birthday, Jolly Rammer.

15
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,510
Happy birthday to you.

16
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:11,150
Is that unforgettable, not un...

17
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,730
The star watching Mint's streams and she's already convinced me to play DMZ 5.

18
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,270
Thanks, Nate!

19
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,350
Even though I know nothing about the series.

20
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,670
Wait, why are you starting at 5?

21
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,050
Oh my gosh.

22
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,110
Is this Ragebite?

23
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,870
I love this game.

24
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,770
One of my favorites.

25
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,150
I've never played this game before.

26
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,630
Wait, it's starting to get darker and darker.

27
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,810
MGS moment.

28
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,210
True!

29
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,150
Will you guys...

30
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,830
Will you guys, in like 10 minutes, tell me to take my medicine?

31
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,210
Can I interest you guys with being my alarms?

32
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,430
My tea is still too hot.

33
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,070
My tea is still too hot.

34
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,030
Okay.

35
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,310
Thank you in like 10, 15 minutes.

36
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,890
I gotta take my medicine.

37
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,710
Thanks for all the 9 months!

38
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,110
Thank you, thank you.

39
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,370
Thank you!

40
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,610
You guys, I had a funny dream last night.

41
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,070
Actually, no.

42
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:27,750
That's a lie.

43
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,670
It wasn't last night.

44
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,790
It was the night before last and I forgot to tell you guys.

45
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,790
I had a dream that I hosted a...

46
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,370
This is gonna sound so silly.

47
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,170
I hosted a ghost tour.

48
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,790
Even though I'm a ghost.

49
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,770
I hosted a ghost tour at some like mansion.

50
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,250
That I... Oh my gosh!

51
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,230
Chat is green.

52
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,710
Oh my god.

53
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,950
Thank you guys!

54
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,970
Thank you so much!

55
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,750
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

56
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,370
Welcome back and welcome!

57
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,010
Thank you.

58
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,490
You can host and spook.

59
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,110
True.

60
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,170
True.

61
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,290
But, I hosted a ghost tour and then I posted about it on Twitter.

62
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,750
I was just like...

63
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,090
I was like, I wonder how many people are gonna come to my ghost tour.

64
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,070
And then I... The day happens and I was just like...

65
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,070
Wow!

66
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,270
There's a lot more people than I expected.

67
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:24,930
And...

68
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,530
And I...

69
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,310
I was like, the mansion is not that big.

70
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,210
And so, me and my mom, I think it was.

71
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,310
Sorry, the details are a little fuzzy because it was the other day that I dreamt this.

72
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,230
We were like, okay, let's figure out how to split people.

73
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,530
How many... How many...

74
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,530
How many...

75
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,850
Like, people per group.

76
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,750
And everybody will travel as a group and I'll like, hop between groups.

77
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,190
So I can say hi to everybody.

78
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,870
And...

79
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,210
And...

80
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,570
And...

81
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:09,070
We were discussing it and everybody who came for the tour all just went inside the mansion.

82
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,630
And just started the tour anyway.

83
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,570
And I was like...

84
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:20,030
After I finished figuring out all the math, which took me an exceptionally long time.

85
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,530
Because literally everybody was gone.

86
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,050
And then I also left too.

87
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,510
Like, I think I had to leave the premises to consult someone else.

88
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,870
To figure out how to divide these groups.

89
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,730
Because I remember having to take like an Uber back to...

90
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,930
Which I'm banned from Uber.

91
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,490
I say Uber, I don't use Uber because I'm banned from Uber.

92
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,310
But...

93
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,730
It's just easier to say.

94
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,770
I remember my Uber driver being like...

95
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,490
That mansion is haunted.

96
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,230
I was like, I know, I know.

97
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,670
And...

98
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,090
I don't know why I'm banned from Uber, I don't know.

99
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,430
I didn't do anything, they just banned me one day.

100
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,770
I probably haunted too much or something, I don't know.

101
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,630
Mighty Wub, happy early birthday!

102
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,350
Anyway...

103
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,370
I get back to the mansion and everybody's gone.

104
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,890
And I was just like, oh my gosh.

105
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,330
And so I was like, okay, I'll go in.

106
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,390
And it's not that, it's a mansion.

107
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,690
But it's not like the biggest mansion in the world.

108
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,190
And there were so many people.

109
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,630
I'll surely be able to run into somebody quickly.

110
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,510
And I go in and nobody's there.

111
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,350
And I'm like going through every room and I'm like...

112
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,670
Where is everybody?

113
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,950
Where is everybody?

114
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,250
And I go into the basement.

115
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:52,710
And...

116
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,130
I go into the basement.

117
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,010
I go into one room.

118
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,150
The basement has so many rooms, it's like a very liminal space.

119
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,050
Feels very backrooms-ish.

120
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:12,090
And I open up a door and I see three people in the room.

121
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,970
Two are VTubers.

122
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,930
One is a VTuber that I recognize.

123
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,810
And one is a VTuber I think I made up in my head.

124
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,590
And then the third is a celebrity.

125
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,910
The VTuber I recognize is Chiyo Champi.

126
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,790
I love her.

127
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,250
Sorry, that was my controller disconnecting.

128
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,390
I watch her streams all the time.

129
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,270
And...

130
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,700
No, it wasn't Ryan Gosling!

131
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,450
You'll never...

132
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,190
It wasn't Ryan.

133
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,790
It was...

134
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,270
It was Eminem.

135
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:00,830
And like, Chiyo and the other VTuber are like face in the corner for some reason.

136
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,890
Like Blair Witch Project style.

137
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,070
But Eminem is conscious.

138
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,610
And he follows...

139
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,030
I was like, oh hey Eminem!

140
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,010
And he follows me out of the room like uncomfortably close.

141
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,870
And I was like, Eminem, can I help you?

142
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,410
He was like, Mint!

143
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,310
You haven't complimented how I look today!

144
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,470
Do I look good today?

145
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,590
And I was like...

146
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,170
I was like, what do you mean Eminem?

147
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,750
And he was like, I wore this Final Fantasy shirt for you!

148
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,660
That's exactly what Eminem would say.

149
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,020
Yeah, exactly.

150
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,600
I was like, oh yeah!

151
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,960
Looking sharp, Eminem!

152
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,760
And that was my dream.

153
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,800
Are you sure it was the real Slim Shady?

154
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,240
Maybe.

155
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
It could have been just...

156
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,340
I called him Eminem first, so...

157
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,680
Sorry I turned up late.

158
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,940
Is she describing a dream?

159
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,960
No, this happened in real life.

160
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,080
No, I'm just kidding.

161
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,060
Yeah, it was a dream.

162
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,360
So Eminem, I like your Final Fantasy T-shirt.

163
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,790
I didn't think that he wanted a compliment though.

164
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,270
Eminem's a little clingy maybe.

165
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,590
Set back to reality.

166
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,990
I'm not the father, sorry.

167
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,170
I'd want a copy of this dream in DVD format, please.

168
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,030
It's crazy because it's one of those types of dreams that I can still see visually in my head.

169
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,770
Right now.

170
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,190
Minto didn't have anyone to take on her ghost tour.

171
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,070
Eminem, now this looks like a job for me.

172
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,530
It feels like one of those Scooby Doo collaboration episodes.

173
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,290
Eminem and Minto collab win.

174
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,270
I feel I'm a little more congested today.

175
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,570
I'm sorry guys, that's why I'm waiting to take my medicine.

176
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,210
But, we're gonna play a short hike.

177
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,490
I don't wanna go hiking actually.

178
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,990
I wanna hike in the video game.

179
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,850
I don't wanna actually do any work.

180
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,150
I want to be able to chill and just relax.

181
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,350
You know, maybe this is a good way to... If you had a busy week, maybe we can...

182
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,970
Hot dog, that's right.

183
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,110
We can relax with Minto.

184
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,310
What's this game about?

185
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,310
I have no idea.

186
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,610
Hey Minky, today's my birthday.

187
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,970
I was wondering if you could wish me a happy birthday, please.

188
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,490
You don't have to be bald for it.

189
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,950
Thank you.

190
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,450
Happy birthday to you.

191
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,670
Happy birthday to you.

192
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,270
Happy birthday, blonde Uchiha.

193
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,350
Happy birthday to you.

194
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,830
Happy birthday, memorable man.

195
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,930
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted memberships.

196
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,350
Thank you, I appreciate it so much.

197
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,470
Thank you, thank you.

198
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,770
But yeah, let's just get into it.

199
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,850
Start the game.

200
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,970
I'll never get tired of this view.

201
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,090
I like the view.

202
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,050
You're my best view.

203
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,230
Claire.

204
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,270
You're gonna have a great time here this summer.

205
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,170
Oh, it's summer?

206
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,490
I did have a busy week and almost became an IRL ghost driving home in the snow yesterday.

207
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,410
Please don't become an IRL ghost.

208
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,330
Take your medicine, Minto.

209
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,750
Has it been 10 minutes?

210
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,130
Oh, I think it has.

211
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,730
Meds time!

212
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,650
I think.

213
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,570
Time for meds, Minto.

214
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,590
Thank you!

215
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,590
Thank you.

216
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,110
I took 10 minutes describing my dream?

217
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,590
Time flies when you're yapping, it's true.

218
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,330
Beep beep 10 minutes.

219
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,390
Beep beep beep beep beep.

220
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,630
Beep beep beep beep beep.

221
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,730
Beep beep 10 minutes.

222
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,730
I like how the animal crossing is talking.

223
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,830
It'll be good to get away from the city.

224
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,310
Hold on.

225
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,530
5 more minutes.

226
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,230
It's still not cool enough.

227
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,070
Sun!

228
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,190
Welcome to Mambushu.

229
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:01,810
Thank you.

230
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,810
It's one of my favorite games, really.

231
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,410
Take a break from everything else going on.

232
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,190
Are you still awake?

233
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,310
Maybe.

234
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,650
Hold on a little longer.

235
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,990
We're almost at the ferry.

236
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,850
The ferry.

237
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,750
A humble original...

238
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,270
Oh, these are credits.

239
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,130
Is that me?

240
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,010
Just a little bird.

241
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,210
I built this.

242
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,230
Shiny.

243
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,190
I think it's a little loud.

244
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,650
Window from 10 minutes in the future.

245
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,690
Don't take the med...

246
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:47,930
No!

247
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:48,930
I need to!

248
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,210
I can jump.

249
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,930
What else can I do?

250
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,490
Shell.

251
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,430
This is my inventory.

252
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,230
I have a cell phone.

253
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,370
I love that short video.

254
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,650
Thank you!

255
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,790
Welcome back to Mambushu.

256
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,630
Thank you.

257
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,470
What's this?

258
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,710
This looks like something I can grab.

259
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,050
Let's set myself on fire.

260
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,550
Oh.

261
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,090
Hey, how's it going?

262
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,970
I haven't seen you all day.

263
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,370
You been busy?

264
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,270
Well, kinda.

265
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,990
Well, not really.

266
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,810
I've been waiting around for a call.

267
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,790
Shut up.

268
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,770
Welcome to Mambushu.

269
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,670
Thank you.

270
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,050
Balthazar.

271
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:33,850
Thanks for the gift.

272
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,570
Well, there's your problem.

273
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,530
There's no reception out here.

274
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:39,690
What?

275
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:39,790
What?

276
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,750
What?

277
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:41,830
Nani?

278
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,710
Yeah, I mean, pretty much no reception.

279
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,690
You might be able to...

280
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,470
You might be able to get some at Hawk Peak.

281
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,830
Funky nighty.

282
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,510
Thanks for the...

283
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,570
Oh, yeah, I guess.

284
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,370
Don't say it.

285
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:01,790
I'm not!

286
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,490
I'm not!

287
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,810
I'm not saying it!

288
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:05,650
God.

289
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,290
I wish we could redo 2024.

290
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,690
I wish we could redo...

291
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,690
I wanna go back...

292
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,110
I wanna time machine and go back in time.

293
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,140
Maliceius?

294
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,560
I hope I said that right.

295
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,260
Welcome to Mambushu.

296
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,640
That's pretty far, isn't it?

297
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,520
It's not that far.

298
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,080
We've all made the trek before.

299
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,300
I figured you would've gone already.

300
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,200
Oh, yeah.

301
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,680
I've been meaning to go.

302
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,320
But...

303
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,520
I just haven't gotten around to it yet.

304
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,940
Well, today is as good a day as any.

305
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,740
Just take White Beach Trail and head north at the fork.

306
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,140
Then follow the signs for Hawk Peak.

307
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,640
Thank God they don't say two in front of it.

308
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,820
I'm so scared!

309
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,420
Chuggie!

310
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,200
Welcome to Mambushu.

311
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,200
It's been a good nine months.

312
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,520
Thank you!

313
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,260
Reese, thanks for the Super Chat.

314
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,460
Joshua, welcome back.

315
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,800
This game is making my computer lag.

316
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,500
No problem.

317
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,780
Is this the trail?

318
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,420
White Coast Trail.

319
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,740
Ranger's Cabin.

320
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,280
That doesn't seem very safe.

321
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,440
I reckon that seems a little dangerous.

322
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,300
Seems a little dangerous.

323
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,040
Who are you?

324
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,640
Mysterious traveler?

325
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:39,760
Claire!

326
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,760
Did you know?

327
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,040
You can hold A while running to glide through the air?

328
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,480
Of course!

329
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,220
Everyone knows that.

330
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,240
Why do you ask?

331
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,320
I don't know.

332
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,640
I just had a feeling you might want to know.

333
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,300
Pregante joke here.

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,520
Okay.

335
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,460
What do I do over here?

336
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,260
There is a shiny up here.

337
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,080
I got a coin.

338
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,820
I'm rich.

339
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,740
In friendship.

340
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,150
We can fly so much.

341
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:22,430
See?

342
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,450
Look at these plants.

343
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,150
I want to do something with them.

344
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,370
What?

345
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:31,770
Why?

346
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,110
I want to.

347
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,450
Yeah, but why?

348
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,790
It's a secret.

349
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,830
Okay.

350
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,630
I'll keep an eye out.

351
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,030
Keep both eyes out, please.

352
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,690
God, these kids are so pushy.

353
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,510
A stick.

354
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,610
I got one stick.

355
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,230
I'm gonna beat this kid up with it.

356
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,950
So what's the deal with the shells?

357
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,910
It's none of your business.

358
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,390
Except for the business of you getting me 15 of them.

359
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,570
Do it yourself!

360
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,450
Lazy ass kid.

361
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,150
Look, there is literally one right here.

362
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,190
Is that one?

363
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:09,830
No.

364
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,050
Meds time.

365
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,830
Thank you.

366
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,720
I'm worried.

367
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,480
I choked on this pill yesterday.

368
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,340
So I'm scared.

369
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
I'm not good at taking pills.

370
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,940
So I have to like kind of...

371
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,940
I have to like...

372
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,680
Can you guys give me encouragement?

373
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,890
It makes me scared because I choked yesterday.

374
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:49,870
Ahem.

375
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,720
I did it!

376
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,130
It started to taste so bad.

377
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,990
Oh my god.

378
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,990
Sorry.

379
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,550
Oh gosh, with the mouse.

380
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,650
Okay, I can't...

381
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,640
Had my cane for a couple of years.

382
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,820
Finally decided to name it.

383
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,160
It has a cool blue handle so I named it my cool cane.

384
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,080
Cool!

385
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Wait, someone...

386
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,440
Kyoki!

387
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,600
Thanks for the five gifted!

388
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,840
Okay, I'm not gonna move my mouse anymore.

389
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,320
Okay, I'm gonna put it here just in case I need to scroll up on chat.

390
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,000
But I'm not gonna...

391
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,760
Senjou, welcome to membership.

392
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,440
Yippee!

393
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,880
I took my medicine!

394
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
Okay, what's this?

395
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,880
Ranger's cabin.

396
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,380
White coaster L.

397
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,540
But what is this?

398
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,900
I'm bigger than the door.

399
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,980
Who lives here?

400
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,560
Sick.

401
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:54,660
Money?

402
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,660
Coin and shell.

403
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,900
Can we fish?

404
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,780
Can we fish?

405
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,520
Is this like Animal Crossing?

406
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,540
Hawk Peak Trail, White Coast Trail, Sid Beach Visitor Center.

407
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,320
Look!

408
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,100
It is like Animal Crossing!

409
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,240
Wait, what's that up there?

410
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,260
Oh my gosh, treasure?

411
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,920
Who are you?

412
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,200
Hey Claire!

413
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,940
How's the day treating ya?

414
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,760
Well, I'm just getting out of the house now.

415
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,960
It's one of those kinds of days.

416
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,500
Yeah, I've been kind of caught up in my head all morning.

417
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,800
Would you say you feel lost and directionless?

418
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,140
Maybe.

419
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,140
Well, I've got just the thing for you.

420
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
Oh no, it's an MLM.

421
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,600
Take this.

422
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,380
Oh, a compass!

423
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,120
To use it, press Y to open your inventory.

424
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,440
Then select it from the items bin.

425
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,580
Oh, thanks.

426
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,880
This should come in handy.

427
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,100
Happy hiking!

428
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,220
Hiking!

429
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,430
Okay, how do we...

430
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,330
Get up...

431
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,890
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

432
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:30,850
And then...

433
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,430
And then...

434
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,490
Big money.

435
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,180
I usually just put it under my tongue, that way I don't actually have to taste it.

436
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,480
But how do you swallow it?

437
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,380
How do you swallow it then if you...

438
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,440
If you don't.

439
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,190
Your Ayami model is really beautiful.

440
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,210
Thank you!

441
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,850
Ayami-mama did such an amazing job, yeah?

442
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:03,470
Yeah.

443
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,590
Down here.

444
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,550
Oh, froggy.

445
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,110
Hey dude, what's happening?

446
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,650
Oh, you know.

447
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,850
Just jamming out on the beach.

448
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,710
Building sandcastles and whatnot.

449
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,870
Are we to disappear?

450
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,350
No!

451
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,750
You guys are not my hallucinations, right?

452
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,950
You're not my delusions.

453
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,130
I mean, I know I'm delusional.

454
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,470
But you're not my delusions, right?

455
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,970
Sounds like a good time.

456
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,330
Isn't it a little big for that?

457
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,110
You can get smaller ones.

458
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,540
Ones made for sandcastles.

459
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,170
What?

460
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,470
Sounds fake.

461
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,770
But if you can show me one, I'd be glad to trade.

462
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,370
Is it in this box?

463
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,810
That would be really mighty convenient.

464
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:01,450
Nope.

465
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,170
What?

466
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,490
There's a rock climbing?

467
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,910
This place is crazy.

468
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,450
Is this like a summer camp or something?

469
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,870
Why can't I fish with my beak?

470
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,490
I'm a bird.

471
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,870
I wish I could be Minky's disembodied schizo voice.

472
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,830
No, you guys are real.

473
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:26,830
Right?

474
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,120
What if you guys all stopped using the chat at once?

475
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,440
It wouldn't do that.

476
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,940
Just to prove a point.

477
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,040
Hey.

478
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,840
Hey there.

479
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,260
What are you up to today?

480
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,120
I'm hiking up to hawk...

481
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,760
Hawk Peak.

482
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,260
Two.

483
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,340
Period.

484
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,540
Hawk Peak.

485
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,440
Period.

486
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,700
That's a tough hike.

487
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,920
Marley, thanks for 7 months.

488
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,680
You know, you'll need to learn to rock climb to make it to the top.

489
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,940
Why not join our rock climbing club?

490
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,340
Is it just the two of you?

491
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,540
Hey.

492
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,380
The Rock Climbers Association has hundreds of members spanning over 35 countries worldwide.

493
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,140
Hundreds of members growing and refining the art of rock climbing.

494
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,820
Pushing the...

495
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,300
I can't keep it up.

496
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,380
Pushing the craft to its absolute limit and beyond.

497
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,560
Best way to take pills.

498
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,660
Put in your mouth with water and drink with your head looking down.

499
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,060
Oh, it doesn't help me though.

500
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,100
I tried.

501
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,080
I meant, if it's just the two of you.

502
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,560
Like, here?

503
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,020
What of it?

504
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,660
Listen, kid.

505
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,820
Climbing ain't for the weak of heart.

506
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,660
This guy sucks.

507
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,420
Most people don't have what it takes.

508
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,680
Your actions have consequences.

509
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,800
It's not really that bad.

510
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,020
So anyway.

511
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,780
You want to join the climbers club?

512
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,460
Sure.

513
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,440
I like the mirage dance.

514
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,300
Thank you.

515
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,480
For real, you have to believe me.

516
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,620
Belive me.

517
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,540
We've got our third member.

518
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,800
Not third.

519
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,280
Just another drop in the hundreds.

520
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,640
Worldwide.

521
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,760
Alright, alright.

522
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,460
Anyway.

523
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,880
So first things first.

524
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,940
You got a golden feather?

525
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,140
Oh, not yet.

526
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,520
You can't climb without one.

527
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,420
But you can buy them at the visitor center.

528
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,340
Why didn't you bring that up first?

529
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,680
I have to pay to join, but not really?

530
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,420
They should be pretty cheap.

531
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,500
Come back when you've bought one.

532
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,100
Okay.

533
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,310
Who are you?

534
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,750
I've heard some rumors.

535
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,250
Do you like rumors?

536
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,650
I dabble.

537
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,430
Okay, hear me out.

538
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,090
Chim just bought a metal detector.

539
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,550
He was running around yesterday, looking for stuff on the island.

540
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,550
It was going nuts.

541
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,770
Seems like there's stuff buried all over the island.

542
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,630
What kind of stuff?

543
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,190
I don't know.

544
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,630
Metal stuff?

545
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,530
Metal gears, perhaps?

546
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:43,850
Treasure.

547
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,450
Shall we treasure hunt today?

548
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,310
This game is so cute.

549
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,270
I think we're gonna have to water these.

550
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,430
That's my suspicion.

551
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,690
Oops, I just...

552
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,090
I fell off, truly.

553
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,790
Let's see.

554
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,850
I wanna go back because I wanna go up.

555
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,610
I can go up here, right?

556
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,090
Wait, can I go up here?

557
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:14,970
Okay, good.

558
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,410
More money.

559
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,130
He says cheap, but...

560
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,010
I don't trust him.

561
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,450
We don't know what the currency is like in this universe.

562
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,050
Easy, easy.

563
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,610
Lots of money.

564
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,670
Let's go back around again.

565
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,170
How big is this island?

566
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,370
How am I...

567
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:42,590
Wait.

568
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,550
Oh, there we go.

569
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,670
It's money.

570
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,910
Select to toggle on or off.

571
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,530
Select.

572
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:54,790
Show.

573
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,070
Okay, it's in the corner.

574
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,480
Oh.

575
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,660
Oh!

576
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,380
We're trespassing.

577
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,200
Excuse me, do you have the time?

578
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,440
What's the conversion of Haiku coins to USD?

579
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,860
I don't know.

580
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,200
I don't know.

581
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,080
We don't know what the economy is like here.

582
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,060
Yeah, let me check.

583
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,160
See, normally I would know the time.

584
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,800
I just lost my watch.

585
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,780
Oh, sorry.

586
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,420
Video games made me believe I would stumble upon many boxes with useful items or money in them.

587
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,560
In reality, most boxes I find have nothing good in them.

588
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,740
Video games made me think boxes held men.

589
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,120
It was very expensive.

590
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,980
And priceless when you consider the sentimental value.

591
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,940
He's trauma-dumping.

592
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,140
I think the game is set in Canada, so sadly the money isn't worth much.

593
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,680
I see.

594
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,100
If you find it, can you bring it back to me?

595
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,020
Sure.

596
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,260
Please don't sell it on the internet or whatever.

597
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,180
It's very valuable to me.

598
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,580
No, don't worry.

599
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,860
I'll bring it right back.

600
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,520
Okay, thanks.

601
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,860
It's probably right in here.

602
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,880
Stupid guy doesn't know how to dig.

603
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,820
Just use your hands.

604
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,980
He's like, I'm a goat.

605
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,120
Why would we buy a golden feather?

606
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,280
No way.

607
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,120
It's just within...

608
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,820
If only I knew how to rock climb.

609
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,520
Oh my god, it's just within my reach.

610
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,070
Hold on.

611
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,690
I'm smart.

612
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,530
Wait, hello?

613
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:47,850
Come on.

614
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,950
Why is the pathway so steep?

615
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,280
I did it.

616
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,740
I didn't even need to pay for it.

617
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,640
Minto, don't take your meds.

618
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,600
Too late.

619
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,010
What the?

620
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,310
What was that?

621
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,090
I dropped a feather.

622
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,210
I'm molting.

623
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,090
Did you see that?

624
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:21,970
I climbed.

625
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,390
Hawk Peak Trail.

626
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,110
Notice.

627
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,190
Hawk Peak Trail is a strenuous hike.

628
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,210
I thought this was supposed to be a cozy time.

629
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,630
You might need golden feathers to complete it.

630
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,110
Golden feathers are for sale at the visitor center.

631
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,310
What?

632
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,410
Feathers?

633
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,210
What do you mean by that?

634
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,350
This place is humongous.

635
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,030
Humongous among us.

636
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,400
I feel like I'm about to see a dead body in here, you know?

637
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,240
Gold feather stamina.

638
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,460
I see.

639
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,360
It's a toy shovel.

640
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,120
No, no, don't use my golden feather.

641
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,740
Don't use it willy nilly.

642
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,020
Now we go back to Frogport.

643
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,710
I can't believe I'm 30 minutes late.

644
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,910
I forgive you, Eggman.

645
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,770
Just goes to show I'm a little under the weather.

646
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,350
No, just like me.

647
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,030
I was so stopped up I didn't even smell...

648
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,280
There's gonna be a marathon race at Meteor Lake today.

649
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,200
The competition this year is fierce.

650
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,420
Okay.

651
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,620
I might be a little lost.

652
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,560
Visitor center, Hoth Beach.

653
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,700
Sid Beach, okay.

654
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,040
So we are on the right path.

655
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,620
Oh wait, I know.

656
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:12,960
Kind of.

657
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,160
Down here is where the rock climbing is.

658
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:18,920
Somewhere.

659
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,900
There, yeah.

660
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,240
But hold on, before we do that...

661
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,440
Check out this shovel I found.

662
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,620
Golden feather recharges.

663
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,020
Might be a little more your size.

664
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,560
Well that's perfect.

665
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,600
Let's trade.

666
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,100
When you want to use my shovel, press Y to open your inventory and equip it.

667
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,220
Keep it fresh.

668
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,270
Shovel.

669
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,010
Press B to equip.

670
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,910
Alright, nice.

671
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,330
Up there.

672
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:01,990
Okay.

673
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:02,570
Wait.

674
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,750
Let's go around.

675
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:04,550
Wait.

676
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,830
This way.

677
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:06,650
Nice.

678
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,930
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

679
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,050
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

680
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,890
Were there other places to dig?

681
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,710
I can't remember.

682
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,030
Was there anything else back this way?

683
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,670
Maybe not, huh?

684
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,850
Oh, nope.

685
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,210
One by the golden feather.

686
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:36,550
Okay.

687
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,060
This game is so cute.

688
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,720
Oh my god!

689
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,220
He is building a whole civilization!

690
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,980
We've given him so much power!

691
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,240
Oh my gosh!

692
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,660
All it took was a little...

693
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,000
All he needed was a better shovel!

694
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,360
He's unstoppable!

695
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,520
I didn't get much sleep last night, you guys.

696
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,600
Howdy.

697
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,320
How can I help you?

698
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,360
I heard you sell golden feathers here.

699
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,260
We do.

700
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,840
You can buy 40 coins!

701
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,820
I'm just a child.

702
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,720
What else do you sell?

703
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,300
We also sell provincial park merchandise.

704
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,440
We're kind of low on stock.

705
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,240
But that's good, actually.

706
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,840
It's been a busy season.

707
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,720
Provincial parks must be trending or something.

708
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,280
It's possible.

709
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,860
Anyway, we only have one hat left.

710
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,540
It costs 100 coins!

711
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,000
I'll pass.

712
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:54,820
Okay.

713
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,040
Yikes.

714
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,780
Oh, there was one right around here, right?

715
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,380
Oh gosh.

716
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,140
Hello?

717
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,540
Hello?

718
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,000
Hello?

719
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,260
There we go.

720
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,160
More money.

721
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,980
That was not your...

722
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,900
That was not your watch, I'm sorry!

723
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,820
Mysterious cave?

724
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,160
Nevermind.

725
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,760
100 coins.

726
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,160
What does he think I'm made of?

727
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,630
Absolute scam.

728
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,960
Who are you?

729
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,860
That's what I said!

730
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,540
I was planning on hiking to... period.

731
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,560
Hawk Peak, period.

732
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,420
But the path suddenly got really steep.

733
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,100
Do you think it's climbable?

734
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,720
Well, it would be if I had a golden feather.

735
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,300
Apparently they sell them at the visitor center.

736
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,440
Oh,

737
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,520
oh, hello?

738
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,700
Am I stupid?

739
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,460
Oh, there we go.

740
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,060
Apparently I am.

741
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,180
Hi.

742
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,320
Hi!

743
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,960
Are you okay?

744
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,600
Not really.

745
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,940
I'm supposed to run a marathon race today.

746
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,420
But I've lost my lucky headband.

747
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,140
I've worn it to every race I've ever run.

748
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,500
I don't know if I could race without it.

749
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,120
Where'd you lose it?

750
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,060
Somewhere in the Blackwood Forest.

751
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,640
I think.

752
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,280
I could take a look for you.

753
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:00,980
Really?

754
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,400
You'd do that for me?

755
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,680
Sure.

756
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,300
It's a red headband.

757
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,000
I could give you a reward.

758
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,700
I could give you a pair of running shoes.

759
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,000
Don't you need those yourself?

760
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,300
Well, I just got sponsored by the shoe company.

761
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,320
They gave me like ten pairs.

762
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,360
Wow!

763
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,980
Yippee, no more sickness.

764
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,280
You're... you?

765
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,540
You're not sick anymore?

766
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,640
I like Minto because of the way that she is.

767
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,200
How am I?

768
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,160
Congrats.

769
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,720
Thanks.

770
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,520
But let me know if you see a red headband.

771
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,400
Okay.

772
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,880
It's this way, right?

773
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,980
Blackwood Trail.

774
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,440
Okay.

775
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,520
So maybe we go this way and then go up?

776
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:54,660
Oh?

777
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,740
Money, money, money, money, money.

778
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,980
The music is so nice.

779
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,200
This guy is wearing... I think this guy stole the headband.

780
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,100
Wait, wait, wait.

781
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,380
Come back you thief!

782
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,380
Weird question, but where did you get that headband?

783
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,140
I don't know.

784
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,200
I had it for ages.

785
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,480
Why?

786
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,460
I was just talking to this rabbit.

787
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,360
She said she lost her headband somewhere in the forest.

788
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,640
Wait, you mean Sue?

789
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,520
Maybe?

790
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,020
I didn't get her name.

791
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,020
She was really worried about it though.

792
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,220
You're pretty... good.

793
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,780
She said it was lucky and she needs it to race.

794
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,260
I'm supposed to race her later today.

795
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,980
Oh my gosh, it's the tortoise and the hare.

796
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,100
She's so talented.

797
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,980
I've been really looking forward to it.

798
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,200
I think this guy is a liar.

799
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,100
What if I gave you mine?

800
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,340
I'm pretty sure it's the same kind.

801
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,140
No, this guy is a nice guy.

802
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,780
It's Raphael.

803
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,840
He's a mutant turtle.

804
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,900
Everybody loves Amito.

805
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,280
She's a terrific maid.

806
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,260
Thank you.

807
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,120
Maybe she wouldn't notice.

808
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,980
But then it wouldn't be lucky.

809
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,420
I don't know.

810
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,420
Just take it.

811
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,020
See if she wants it.

812
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,100
Ew, I don't want to take someone else's nasty sweaty headband.

813
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,160
That sounds horrible.

814
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,540
Unless... they're a cute girl.

815
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,180
Then... I'll consider it.

816
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,340
Five minute alarm.

817
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,220
Is that for the... for my medicine?

818
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,540
I think the notice are backed up a little bit.

819
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,440
Thank you!

820
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,580
Oh wait, I think I went to the wrong one.

821
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,860
I tried to fly to that one instead.

822
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,360
I went the wrong way.

823
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,720
I'm trapped.

824
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,360
Girl sweat.

825
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,940
Look at him, he's doing all his rounds.

826
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,360
Oh, money, money, money.

827
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,400
Little coin.

828
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,400
I want the hat.

829
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,380
Oh, I have enough for the hat.

830
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,580
I might be rich.

831
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,100
Meteor Lake.

832
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:31,980
Overlook.

833
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,700
Hawk Peak Trail.

834
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,440
Blackwood Trail.

835
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,440
Would you take Snake's headband?

836
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,440
Would you sniff it?

837
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,320
It would smell so bad, most likely.

838
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,820
It would probably smell the worst.

839
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,920
Oh my god, they're running.

840
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,400
Me too!

841
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,320
Oh my god, we're all running.

842
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,800
Look how fast I am!

843
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,640
I am speed!

844
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:54,740
Everybody...

845
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,960
Watch out, eat my dust!

846
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
I'm the best one to ever do it!

847
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,480
You guys don't... You don't stand a chance against me.

848
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,520
Look, I can wait here.

849
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,320
I don't even know what the pathway is.

850
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,580
I wish I were a bird.

851
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,340
I hate leg days.

852
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,160
Wait, can he push me?

853
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
Dang it, I thought he was going to push me to victory.

854
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:23,900
Good morning.

855
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,740
Good morning!

856
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:34,010
This place is a little overwhelming with how much I can go.

857
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,090
More money.

858
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:41,940
How's it going?

859
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,840
Good.

860
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,820
The fish are biting today.

861
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,780
Cool, cool.

862
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,700
So, uh, is fishing hard?

863
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,620
Nope.

864
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,060
It's easy.

865
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,400
Good afternoon.

866
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,040
Good afternoon!

867
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,320
Your name is cut off.

868
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,320
Does it show me your kittens?

869
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,700
Thanks for the five kittens!

870
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,320
I could show you... Oh!

871
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,920
He's going to show you the kitties.

872
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,400
Kitties.

873
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:15,820
Yeah.

874
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:16,940
Oh, he's showing me.

875
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,540
Okay, I'll lend you my spare rod.

876
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,360
Yay!

877
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,620
Okay, we fish now.

878
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,100
Cast your line.

879
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,840
Casting your line is pretty easy.

880
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,220
Just press B.

881
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,060
Aggressive.

882
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,700
Oh, kittens.

883
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,420
So...

884
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,860
What do I do now?

885
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:45,660
Yo, wait.

886
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:46,580
Oh.

887
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:47,780
Okay.

888
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,680
Uh, am I doing this right?

889
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:04,570
Maybe.

890
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,830
Maybe I should cast it again.

891
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,830
You know, find a better spot.

892
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,730
This spot is good.

893
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:19,110
I saw some fish around here earlier.

894
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,090
That's a good sign.

895
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:25,710
Sometimes, you just gotta wait.

896
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,770
Patience is key.

897
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,930
Not my strong suit.

898
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:32,370
It's so quiet.

899
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:39,630
Look alive!

900
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:40,990
A fish is nibbling!

901
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:42,710
Should I pull it out?

902
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,110
Not yet.

903
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,090
You gotta wait for it to bite.

904
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,490
Okay, okay, okay.

905
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,170
Oh, now!

906
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:54,830
Press B!

907
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,550
Oh, what do I...

908
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,290
Oh, pull back and tap B!

909
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,170
Pull back?

910
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,790
Interesting technique.

911
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,230
That's...

912
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:10,990
That's scripted, right?

913
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:12,250
Marie!

914
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,430
Oh my gosh!

915
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:14,410
Thanks for the raid!

916
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:16,390
Hello!

917
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,030
Hello, hello.

918
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:20,230
Hello!

919
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:23,630
Bring it back!

920
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,490
Thanks for the five gifted!

921
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:26,710
That's alright.

922
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,170
Just give it another shot.

923
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:31,270
And remember, once you hook the fish...

924
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,450
Pull back and tap B.

925
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,490
Wait, I did pull back!

926
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,730
Okay, okay, okay.

927
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,630
Oh, sorry I fell in the water.

928
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:47,750
It's pretty embarrassing.

929
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,990
Thanks for the gift, dude!

930
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:50,950
Alvin Kapo!

931
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,050
Thank you!

932
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,870
I can't see it too.

933
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,610
Rubber, rubber.

934
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,790
Thank you, thank you guys!

935
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,750
So do I go back on the...

936
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,130
I don't know.

937
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:06,530
I'll try.

938
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:07,450
Not at all.

939
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,450
You got spirit.

940
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:09,970
Okay, alright, alright.

941
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:13,610
Oh, wait!

942
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:14,550
I wanna do it again!

943
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,690
Oops, sorry.

944
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:18,670
I scared away that fish.

945
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,110
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

946
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:35,790
Albino Northern Pike!

947
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,110
Yeah, baby!

948
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:47,450
How many seashells?

949
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,670
Okay, we only got seven.

950
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:51,670
This guy is so chill.

951
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,210
I'm so stoked to eat breakfast.

952
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:57,410
Oh, but it's already the afternoon.

953
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,450
Tomorrow's breakfast.

954
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,830
It's the best meal of the day.

955
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,310
Okay, dude.

956
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,230
Not gonna lie, I agree with that.

957
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,630
I think breakfast food is some of the best food.

958
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,150
It's so good.

959
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:15,570
Like...

960
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,930
Getting like a waffle...

961
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,030
Hash browns...

962
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:22,030
Bacon...

963
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,530
Oh, it's so good.

964
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:23,810
It's so good.

965
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,270
Maybe I'll have breakfast for dinner today.

966
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,930
This guy is a freak.

967
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:41,490
Go into the water.

968
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:44,350
Nice.

969
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,070
Go into the fire.

970
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,770
Wake up log.

971
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:50,870
Welcome to membership.

972
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,270
Thank you!

973
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,990
Oh, I should introduce myself.

974
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,290
Hi, everybody.

975
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:58,790
My name is Mint Phantom.

976
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,050
I'm a ghost maid.

977
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,950
I'm a little sick, so sorry if you hear me.

978
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,830
Like a coughing baby.

979
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:12,980
Oh my god.

980
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,640
I didn't know that I could go out here.

981
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,560
I thought I was gonna get invisible wall, but no.

982
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,480
Minecraft.

983
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,000
Can I take this?

984
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,200
Nice.

985
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,130
Fast travel.

986
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:55,870
Oh, that's nice.

987
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:57,070
So...

988
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,790
Maybe that area I found before actually was...

989
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,150
was...

990
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,970
a cave that I could explore.

991
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:11,430
It's kind of spooky over here though.

992
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:12,150
I'm not gonna lie.

993
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,350
Why is this mine abandoned?

994
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:15,750
Why was it sealed up?

995
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,490
Am I gonna die?

996
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,210
I'm gonna fish.

997
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:21,730
Wait.

998
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:22,830
Why?

999
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:24,190
Equip.

1000
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,170
Wait, hold on.

1001
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,190
Oh, sorry.

1002
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,010
There we go.

1003
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,480
I'm scared of the thunder lightning.

1004
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,040
We just have to wait.

1005
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,030
Hi, dog.

1006
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,270
Mr. Cooper Black.

1007
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,380
I thought we had a fish for sure.

1008
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:27,960
What?

1009
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,600
Yeah, baby!

1010
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,260
What did I get?

1011
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,360
A tiny brook trout.

1012
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,020
So small.

1013
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,340
See, like this looks like we can break it.

1014
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,800
No, I guess not.

1015
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,700
Should I be over here?

1016
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,020
Did it suddenly turn into a horror game?

1017
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,160
Oh, no, we're fine.

1018
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,420
The Orange Islands.

1019
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,100
This place is huge!

1020
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,780
Yeah, they're...

1021
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,840
Oh god, he's dead!

1022
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,380
It is a horror game.

1023
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,460
Need the bomb item for...

1024
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,120
Wait, seriously?

1025
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,740
Are you okay?

1026
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,080
No, I'm not.

1027
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,600
I'm dying!

1028
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:24,600
This

1029
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,240
is a very serious problem.

1030
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,040
Oh, is there anything I can do?

1031
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,580
All I wanted to do was ride the boat.

1032
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:38,740
But no.

1033
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,800
You're not allowed.

1034
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,520
You have to wait until you're older.

1035
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,140
Well, guess what?

1036
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,360
I'm older now!

1037
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,560
That was five minutes ago.

1038
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,840
Hashtag, worst dad ever.

1039
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:57,980
Hold on there.

1040
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,540
I'll take you out later.

1041
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,700
But later is a million years away!

1042
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,040
Hey dad.

1043
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:06,860
Hey Claire.

1044
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:07,960
How's it going?

1045
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,860
Um, I'm alright.

1046
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:10,920
How's business?

1047
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,060
Quiet.

1048
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,380
At least I'm getting some good reading time in.

1049
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:16,580
That's...

1050
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,720
I guess that's a positive.

1051
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,900
Yeah, this is my dad now.

1052
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,640
Is the motorboat booked today?

1053
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,060
Nope, not yet.

1054
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,620
You want to take it for a spin?

1055
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,360
The rental fee is a hundred coins!

1056
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,840
No, I have a hat to buy.

1057
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:35,940
Maybe later.

1058
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,300
Talk to you later.

1059
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,820
Where am I?

1060
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,900
Oh, welcome to the Orange Islands.

1061
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:48,320
Despite living in the shadow of Hawk Peak, this small cluster of islands has garnered a unique reputation of its own.

1062
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:51,200
Are you able to guess how these islands got their name?

1063
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,960
Uh...

1064
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,300
It's the color of the rock.

1065
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,780
It will probably surprise you, but the islands are named after the color of their rock!

1066
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,140
Now that rocks!

1067
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,220
That's a rock fact.

1068
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:09,860
For centuries, travelers have been dazzled by the streams of red and orange that flow through these cliffs.

1069
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,260
What gives these stones their vibrant colors, you ask?

1070
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,740
Dead bodies.

1071
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,840
Well, that's simply iron oxide you're seeing.

1072
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,280
Now you know!

1073
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,040
You've actually learned something new today.

1074
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,560
I feel patronized somehow.

1075
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,480
This game is so colorful.

1076
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,230
What's this?

1077
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:44,190
I got... Oh, is this for watering?

1078
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:48,270
Uh, nope.

1079
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,370
The Helianthus disultantis rubber flower.

1080
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,290
Hawk Peak Provincial Park's official flower.

1081
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:02,110
This unique species blooms instantly in flash flooding conditions, fading like a water balloon.

1082
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:04,250
Maybe I have to put water in first.

1083
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,690
Put water in it first.

1084
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,270
You guys stop!

1085
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,090
You guys stop reading my mind.

1086
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,710
Please do not remove buckets from the pack.

1087
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,190
A bucket full of water seems heavy.

1088
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:19,430
I don't think I could fly or climb carrying a bucket full of water.

1089
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,030
But I could probably still glide.

1090
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,070
Okay.

1091
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,370
Not... Oh, it's raining here too.

1092
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,510
Spooky scary.

1093
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,890
Oh, there's another one here.

1094
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,250
Let's water this one.

1095
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,770
Okay, alright, alright.

1096
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,390
Okay, okay, okay.

1097
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:53,870
Gone fishing.

1098
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,130
This looks suspicious.

1099
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:04,030
This looks mighty suspicious.

1100
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:17,420
Once you successfully climb to the mountain, could you...

1101
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,480
Maybe could you bring others up there?

1102
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,480
Like some kind of...

1103
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,180
Stop!

1104
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,280
Do you think like...

1105
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,520
Do you think she like that girl...

1106
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,520
I don't know her name.

1107
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,240
Oh my god.

1108
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:38,780
Oh no!

1109
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,860
Do you think she like...

1110
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,700
Has like a catchphrase...

1111
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,100
Where she's like, talk to you later.

1112
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,170
Do you think she's like...

1113
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,930
Oh my god, I was about to do the same thing.

1114
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,270
She's like...

1115
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,290
Wow, I totally meant to do that.

1116
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,970
She has a podcast called...

1117
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:08,030
You're right!

1118
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:09,450
I forgot about her podcast!

1119
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,110
Yeah, that's right.

1120
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,870
Let's see, where do we go from here?

1121
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:25,470
This place is so big.

1122
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,870
Maybe we go back...

1123
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:30,930
To the...

1124
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:36,410
To the trail.

1125
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,250
We actually try to climb the mountain.

1126
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,260
No, I'm not fishing anymore.

1127
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,540
Sorry, every time I click out of the game, it stops the music.

1128
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,480
I tried to get a doctor's appointment today.

1129
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,560
This is the saddest thing, you guys.

1130
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,220
I tried to get a doctor's appointment today.

1131
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,340
I was trying to make the appointment.

1132
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,540
Only to find out that...

1133
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,380
I guess...

1134
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,500
I don't have ghost insurance anymore.

1135
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:14,680
So...

1136
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,460
I have to figure that out.

1137
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,560
I think I'll just go to...

1138
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:24,260
I think I'll just go to one of the small clinics though.

1139
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,300
To try and...

1140
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,300
Oh, to get an appointment anyway.

1141
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,760
So I can at least get some medicine.

1142
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,600
Yeah, I don't know what happened.

1143
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,220
Howdy.

1144
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,820
I guess I'll just die.

1145
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:42,820
I'm already dead!

1146
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,440
Hi.

1147
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:47,900
What you doing?

1148
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,220
Taking a break?

1149
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:50,120
Hey.

1150
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,660
Don't tell anyone, alright?

1151
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:52,560
I won't.

1152
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,600
I don't even know who I'd tell.

1153
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:55,420
Heh.

1154
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:56,020
Good.

1155
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,480
I can't wait to be done today.

1156
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,300
When my shift's over, I'll be out catching me some rare fish.

1157
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,040
It's my hobby, you see.

1158
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,900
If you happen to net some fish yourself, bring them to me and I'll trade your coin.

1159
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:08,980
I caught some fish already.

1160
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:09,700
Oh?

1161
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,600
Can I take a look at them?

1162
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,860
Take a look at...

1163
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,040
This way.

1164
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,100
I don't...

1165
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,840
This is my first fish that I sell.

1166
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,960
Guess you'll have to double die.

1167
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,570
Hold on now.

1168
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,150
Oh.

1169
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,150
What is this?

1170
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:34,190
The rare albino nor...

1171
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:34,710
It's rare?

1172
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:37,710
That's a mighty catch right there.

1173
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:39,950
80 coins.

1174
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:43,030
Is that all?

1175
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,830
Sell this tiny guy.

1176
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,170
The brook trout, eh?

1177
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:49,150
I'll give you 8 for it.

1178
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:49,690
Oh, what?

1179
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:50,410
Damn!

1180
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,350
Our first catch was a catch!

1181
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,790
That's all for now.

1182
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,850
How did we get so lucky?

1183
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:00,850
Lucky...

1184
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,150
You can climb this thing?

1185
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,370
Kind of.

1186
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:10,050
This music is making me go a little bonkers.

1187
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,160
What's that?

1188
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,360
Something was shining over there.

1189
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,280
I hope the plants...

1190
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,360
I hope the plants stay...

1191
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,380
Stay planted.

1192
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,580
Or stay...

1193
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,440
Bloomed.

1194
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,940
Thank you so much!

1195
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,780
We're so close.

1196
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,200
We are so close to 15!

1197
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,580
Then we'll know what that little punk was up to.

1198
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:09,900
But if you take a trip to Europe and coincidentally need to visit the hospital, it's much cheaper.

1199
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:10,960
No insurance needed.

1200
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,200
We even have someone willing to host and take you on a tour.

1201
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,000
Thank you for the suggestion, MissFist.

1202
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:22,940
I'll be okay.

1203
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:24,080
I just have to re-enroll.

1204
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,320
But it was just kind of a shock when I was like, I need to make a doctor's appointment.

1205
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,080
I hope I can get one today.

1206
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,860
And then it was like, no, you don't get any at all!

1207
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,280
I'm not going to go to a doctor just for a cold though.

1208
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,840
Well, I mean a different country doctor.

1209
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,280
Yo, this updraft is on point.

1210
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,680
You could get some sick dives on it.

1211
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,180
How do you dive?

1212
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:00,240
Oh dang, it's easy!

1213
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,080
But it takes some practice.

1214
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,360
You gotta hear me out.

1215
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,320
First, you gotta be gliding.

1216
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,000
As you know, you glide by holding A.

1217
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,740
Then if you're high enough off the ground, release your control stick and dive downward.

1218
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,920
But you must still remember to hold A.

1219
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,820
That's the tricky part.

1220
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,800
With a good dive, you can build up a lot of speed.

1221
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,980
You can practice by gliding over this updraft.

1222
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,380
It'll give you a lot of height to work with.

1223
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,120
I'm supposed to fly!

1224
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,450
How do I empty it?

1225
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:48,550
How do I empty the water bucket?

1226
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,720
Scoop or pour?

1227
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,680
I did press B.

1228
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,460
I'm pouring.

1229
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,760
Can I put it away?

1230
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:21,690
And then let go.

1231
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:27,250
I like the music there.

1232
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:37,520
And then we go here, right?

1233
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,180
And then we equip our bucket again.

1234
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,680
And we pour.

1235
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,620
Oh, it's empty.

1236
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,340
I'm just gonna fly to the treasure chest.

1237
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,040
I don't know if I get enough air though, is the issue.

1238
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,120
Oh, yes I do.

1239
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:03,960
I'm just stupid.

1240
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,720
More money!

1241
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:17,690
Seashell.

1242
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:22,410
I imagine we'll get...

1243
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,510
Wait, is this a pickaxe?

1244
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,650
I was gonna say an actual axe, but I guess we don't need one.

1245
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,890
The way forward is blocked.

1246
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,520
Interesting.

1247
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,900
Okay.

1248
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:44,920
We're swimming.

1249
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,080
We're collecting so much stuff.

1250
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,740
Guys, we have just one more!

1251
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,080
One more seashell.

1252
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,020
Also, I saw whatever that was.

1253
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:56,940
It looked like binoculars.

1254
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,980
Okay, I think this leads back to the...

1255
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,200
To the toucan, yeah.

1256
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,540
Just one more!

1257
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,980
Look, we can...binoculars.

1258
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,500
Over here?

1259
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:15,820
Over yonder?

1260
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:16,540
Somewhere.

1261
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:17,500
Hello?

1262
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,640
Is it really high up or something?

1263
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,400
I'm scared.

1264
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,040
How far out can I swim?

1265
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:31,920
To the trash.

1266
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,000
This seems...dangerous.

1267
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,420
This seems...

1268
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:46,000
This seems...

1269
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,870
Does anyone have the...

1270
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:53,070
The lessless phobia?

1271
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:58,330
What is that ghost shadow then?

1272
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,230
No!

1273
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:04,410
No!

1274
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,880
I feel so bad!

1275
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,280
No!

1276
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,400
Thank you, but no!

1277
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,220
Thank you.

1278
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,360
Get well soon threat.

1279
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:37,360
Tomorrow I'm gonna go to a clinic and get some medicine.

1280
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:37,980
Hopefully.

1281
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,320
I don't think it'll be that much.

1282
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,800
I don't think it'll be that much.

1283
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:48,340
Whoever suggested the umbrella, thank you.

1284
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:55,340
See, there's a shadow of what looks like binoculars here, but I can't tell where it's coming from.

1285
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,920
Yeah, I'm so sick of being sick.

1286
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,480
Maybe this way.

1287
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,300
Over this way.

1288
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,320
Maybe.

1289
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:14,420
Maybe.

1290
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:19,980
Pretty.

1291
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,480
I have to climb him.

1292
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:26,760
Actually.

1293
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,800
I think I need more feathers.

1294
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,420
Maybe this way?

1295
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,240
No...oh wait.

1296
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:52,960
Maybe possibly get a better immune system.

1297
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,500
That's so true.

1298
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,760
Why didn't I think of that?

1299
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,140
I'm just gonna go buy a new body.

1300
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,020
The final seashell!

1301
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,400
We got it.

1302
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,820
Oh, another stick.

1303
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,660
Still don't know what these are for.

1304
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,740
Back to Hawk Peak Island.

1305
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:37,370
This bronchio thing is going around everywhere.

1306
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:38,310
It's hard to shake off.

1307
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:39,230
I'm on week two.

1308
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:39,670
No!

1309
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,370
Aw man.

1310
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,830
Everybody's getting sick.

1311
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,590
Stay healthy everybody!

1312
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:52,450
Wait, did we just go in a circle?

1313
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,030
I think we did.

1314
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,410
We gotta go buy another golden feather.

1315
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:00,730
I suppose.

1316
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,990
Is it this way?

1317
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,270
Where was that?

1318
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:12,590
I think I'm lost.

1319
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:15,710
I'm not lost.

1320
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,570
I know exactly where I am.

1321
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:18,750
What's this say?

1322
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:20,810
Back to Hawk Peak Island.

1323
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,050
Yeah, I get it.

1324
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,820
Oh yeah, the hat too.

1325
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,540
We gotta get our hat.

1326
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,540
Awesome!

1327
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:32,480
This fits us.

1328
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,020
Oh my gosh, this is perfect.

1329
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,160
This is absolutely perfect.

1330
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:37,620
Hey kid!

1331
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,280
I got your shells.

1332
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:41,800
I'll take them.

1333
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,120
And I get...

1334
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:44,720
So now what?

1335
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,900
Do I get anything?

1336
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:48,840
No!

1337
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,140
Not even a thank you?

1338
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,760
That's not very nice.

1339
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,840
I do what it takes to survive.

1340
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,900
I never promised you anything.

1341
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:02,580
Actually...

1342
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,100
Oh, I do have something for you.

1343
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,380
A new job.

1344
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,100
I already have a job.

1345
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,200
Well make this your side gig.

1346
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,060
What if I don't take it?

1347
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,660
It's your loss.

1348
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,720
Good jobs are hard to find.

1349
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,780
So what will it be?

1350
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,860
But he's still not promising me anything.

1351
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,600
I thought it was a fetch quest.

1352
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,240
Okay, let's just do the side gig.

1353
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:29,980
Good.

1354
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,120
Take this.

1355
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,880
Shell necklace.

1356
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:35,660
And deliver it to Ranger Mei.

1357
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,040
That is all.

1358
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,280
Okay.

1359
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,480
Hi Mentaichan.

1360
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:56,900
Ranger Mei.

1361
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,160
Was this Ranger Mei?

1362
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,360
Who are you?

1363
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,660
I've got a delivery.

1364
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,140
It's from Jen.

1365
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,500
Oh, wow!

1366
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,040
It's so pretty.

1367
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,660
She's such a sweet girl.

1368
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,060
She kind of sucks.

1369
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,640
Collecting all those shells must have been hard work.

1370
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,860
Well actually...

1371
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:18,240
Never mind.

1372
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,140
Oh, I remembered something.

1373
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,420
I found this golden feather in the cabin.

1374
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:25,260
I figured you could use it.

1375
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:26,760
Oh!

1376
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,020
Worth, worth, worth, worth, worth!

1377
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,940
This is weird timing.

1378
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,760
Is this like a reward for delivering the necklace?

1379
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:35,280
Uh, nope.

1380
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:39,040
Oh, that was worth.

1381
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:39,780
That was so worth.

1382
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,380
So now...

1383
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,180
Okay.

1384
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,920
Now we have more stamina.

1385
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,660
But we're going to go buy another one anyway.

1386
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,620
We're going to buy so many...

1387
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,320
golden feathers.

1388
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,400
Oh wait, I never finished the rock climbing thing, did I?

1389
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,720
I just left them hanging.

1390
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:02,600
My bad.

1391
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:05,100
Sorry, club.

1392
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,320
I want to be like Godzilla through here.

1393
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,000
Rock climbing club.

1394
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,580
I guess I...

1395
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,620
I got a golden feather.

1396
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,780
Yep, great.

1397
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:24,640
So to get started, you can try climbing the short wall here.

1398
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,480
Just push against the wall and hold A.

1399
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:28,940
Nice one.

1400
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:29,620
Whatever.

1401
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:32,780
The climb is easy.

1402
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:35,040
Real pros use the big wall.

1403
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,120
If you're having trouble with the big wall, just watch my technique.

1404
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,760
It's highly refined from years of climbing.

1405
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:47,900
Oh.

1406
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,520
Dang it.

1407
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,800
I want to show this guy who's boss.

1408
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,120
I got this.

1409
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:56,920
Wait.

1410
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:58,500
Okay, hold on.

1411
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,320
Wow, good climbing!

1412
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,520
Eh, it was alright.

1413
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,240
So, I know you can fly and all.

1414
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,300
But your stamina will last longer if you climb places instead.

1415
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,220
Push the kid, I know, right?

1416
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,600
Cool.

1417
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,600
What's next?

1418
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,120
Come on.

1419
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,820
Come on.

1420
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,340
Say the line.

1421
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:41,990
To Hawk Peak.

1422
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:43,870
Oh, okay.

1423
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:45,690
I still need to warm up myself.

1424
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:46,910
But I'll see you up there.

1425
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:47,750
Alright.

1426
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:55,150
I didn't realize you have stamina when flying too.

1427
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:01,430
Curse game, curse game.

1428
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:01,490
Hmm.

1429
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:12,430
Oh, wait.

1430
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,270
This is where I need to go, actually.

1431
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:19,270
Buy a golden feather.

1432
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:22,230
Now we have three.

1433
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:29,640
And then we'll buy the sick hat.

1434
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:36,720
Climb a wall.

1435
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:39,420
The more golden feathers you have, the more you'll be able to climb and fly.

1436
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:44,000
What kind of merch do you sell?

1437
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:45,020
One hat.

1438
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,540
I'll take it.

1439
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:49,490
Provincial Park hat.

1440
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,300
Why don't you try it on?

1441
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:52,720
Can we?

1442
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,500
Can we wear it?

1443
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:03,940
Howdy.

1444
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,720
You should be able to climb Hawk Tower.

1445
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,020
What's Hawk Tower?

1446
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:10,060
Oh.

1447
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:15,650
What's up?

1448
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:17,290
Wait, so I can buy another one.

1449
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,970
It's actually all the feathers we have.

1450
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:26,930
A boy came by earlier and bought most of our remaining stock.

1451
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,130
You'll have to find more elsewhere.

1452
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:29,990
Sorry.

1453
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,530
Well, that's perfect, actually.

1454
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:33,870
That works.

1455
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,610
Perfectly for us.

1456
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:39,610
We bought our hat.

1457
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:40,450
We...

1458
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,610
We bought our...

1459
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:46,970
Our feathers.

1460
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,630
We are living the life, baby.

1461
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:54,330
Now we can do so much.

1462
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,690
And explore so far.

1463
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:58,910
I love explore.

1464
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,940
I love to explore.

1465
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:05,770
Nice.

1466
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,050
Look at that.

1467
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:12,250
What does it say?

1468
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:13,210
Dear Sign Reader.

1469
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:13,950
Hi.

1470
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,130
I don't know you.

1471
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,070
How would they even get a hawk...

1472
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:21,910
to...

1473
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:23,170
a...

1474
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:23,550
island?

1475
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,170
Wouldn't it be an island?

1476
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,610
But you're probably pretty cool.

1477
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:32,130
I'm cool too.

1478
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,490
We should race each other.

1479
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,990
It would be cool.

1480
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:35,710
Very.

1481
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:38,030
I'm gonna set up a ribbon at the lighthouse.

1482
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,030
Avery.

1483
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:40,710
Okay.

1484
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:43,650
Avery.

1485
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:47,170
She sounds pretty.

1486
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:49,690
I see something sparkly.

1487
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:54,370
More seashell.

1488
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:57,250
Oh, look at that.

1489
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,880
More money.

1490
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,710
So we're still looking for...

1491
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:06,210
What?

1492
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:07,990
The watch?

1493
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:11,350
And...

1494
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:12,630
Is there anything else?

1495
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,970
And we gotta climb the mountain.

1496
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:19,470
Oh, the headband.

1497
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,830
We gotta go find that guy.

1498
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:27,170
I figured I would still look around for the headband.

1499
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:29,570
The actual one.

1500
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,270
But I don't think it seems to be there.

1501
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:33,910
No!

1502
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:35,670
Okay, we can make this.

1503
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:36,230
We can make this.

1504
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:36,790
We can make this.

1505
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:40,410
We can make this.

1506
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:44,530
Probably.

1507
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,590
Oh, I'm drowning?

1508
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:56,830
A golden feather!

1509
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:05,450
Okay, we wanna go to the Black Peak Trail.

1510
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:07,670
We haven't been here either though.

1511
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:09,650
Yeah, Blackwood.

1512
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:10,290
That's what I meant.

1513
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:11,570
Blackwood Trail.

1514
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:12,710
So we go down...

1515
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:17,790
And around...

1516
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:19,710
And somewhere...

1517
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,210
It said I was down.

1518
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:29,370
Down, down, down.

1519
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:31,010
By the river.

1520
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,500
This way maybe?

1521
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,240
They want me to climb.

1522
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,160
Hawk Peak.

1523
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,380
Good Creek Path.

1524
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:47,800
Royal Bridge.

1525
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,700
Okay, this is it.

1526
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,280
Are those aliens?

1527
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,040
What is that?

1528
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,060
Can I zoom?

1529
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,180
Sun.

1530
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:07,760
I think we're having an invasion.

1531
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,640
Look at that guy!

1532
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:11,500
This feels like a jump scare.

1533
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,400
It really does.

1534
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,700
Why did it get so quiet?

1535
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:14,880
It's freaking me out.

1536
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,440
Okay, right over here.

1537
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,820
Any luck finding my headband yet?

1538
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,940
Well, I found this.

1539
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,760
Does it smell like...

1540
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,280
Boys?

1541
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,620
Oh, boys.

1542
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,340
Boys.

1543
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,520
Boys.

1544
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:36,680
Boys.

1545
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,760
Boys smell.

1546
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:45,540
Boys.

1547
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:47,260
Boys.

1548
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,100
That's not it.

1549
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:56,740
The sweat stains aren't in the right place.

1550
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:57,640
Ew.

1551
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,260
Where did you find this?

1552
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:01,140
Actually, the turtle gave it to me.

1553
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,200
They said you could have it.

1554
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,960
They're looking forward to the race and didn't want you to miss it.

1555
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:06,640
What?

1556
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:07,660
Really?

1557
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,800
Taylor, the turtle?

1558
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,580
They're like the regional champion?

1559
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:16,520
This headband has to be at least twice as lucky.

1560
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,460
Possibly even thrice.

1561
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,320
Oh, quadruple lucky.

1562
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:23,780
I underestimated its value.

1563
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:26,920
Okay, I'll take it.

1564
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,100
I'm so pumped.

1565
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:29,600
Take these running shoes.

1566
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,060
Yippee!

1567
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,600
You can hold X to run with them.

1568
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,300
However, just keep in mind that running requires golden feathers.

1569
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,660
Oh, I missed this.

1570
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:50,340
You guys almost had me just leave without taking my treasure.

1571
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,760
We are speeding.

1572
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,600
So now...

1573
01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:02,830
Let's go to the other side.

1574
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,950
Where we were coming from before.

1575
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:08,450
You think I can climb up this whole wall?

1576
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,620
Holy moly!

1577
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:22,610
Wow.

1578
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,110
Our stamina is crazy.

1579
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:28,250
Where are we?

1580
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:31,470
You think we're on the trail?

1581
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,070
The hawk peak?

1582
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:37,790
I want to go look at the yellow area first.

1583
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:44,650
Such progress.

1584
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:46,190
I know, we're killing it.

1585
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:46,870
Hello?

1586
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:47,830
Take that.

1587
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,190
Here.

1588
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:56,330
It's so pretty.

1589
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:15,630
What is this?

1590
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:22,630
I found the secret.

1591
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:24,870
The boxes can be moved.

1592
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:26,430
Interesting.

1593
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:28,370
Such a comfy game.

1594
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:31,030
I'm feeling so snoozy.

1595
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:46,070
Who's over here?

1596
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:47,170
Anybody?

1597
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:50,490
Abandoned?

1598
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:58,590
Money hole!

1599
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:02,600
And a stick.

1600
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:06,400
Surely we'll need the sticks for something.

1601
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,820
So it's good we're finding one.

1602
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,120
Yeah, there was that boat ride too, right?

1603
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,540
That we rejected earlier.

1604
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:15,740
Dango!

1605
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,140
Welcome to membership.

1606
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1607
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,260
One moment.

1608
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:25,530
Where's my bucket?

1609
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:26,530
Oh, I got my bucket.

1610
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:30,610
Okay.

1611
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:43,030
This game makes me feel like there should be a mystery afoot though.

1612
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,730
You know what I mean?

1613
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:45,810
This

1614
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:52,820
is it.

1615
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,160
I'm grave robbing now.

1616
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:56,720
Wait.

1617
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:58,720
This is the mystery.

1618
01:25:59,000 --> 01:25:59,740
It has to be.

1619
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,680
Why is there a cemetery here?

1620
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,160
And the music is stopped.

1621
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:08,500
Now it's raining.

1622
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:15,100
The weather is a little finicky on this island I'd say.

1623
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:41,130
My name is Avery!

1624
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:43,530
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1625
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:45,390
Hi, I'm Claire.

1626
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:47,070
I think I saw your sign.

1627
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:48,290
You did?

1628
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:49,490
Excellent!

1629
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:51,670
So have you come to race me?

1630
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:53,910
Sure.

1631
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:55,510
Fantastic!

1632
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:59,030
So there's this abandoned building to the west of here.

1633
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:01,150
At least, I think it's abandoned.

1634
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:02,530
West.

1635
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:07,960
Anyway.

1636
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:10,540
I'm thinking we should race to the top of it.

1637
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:13,040
Whoever touches the post up there first...

1638
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,960
Oh, that's the one we saw before, right?

1639
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,140
And also...

1640
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:20,720
We should only use five golden feathers during this race.

1641
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,480
I have five.

1642
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,540
That'll make it more interesting.

1643
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:24,440
You ready?

1644
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:26,420
Awesome!

1645
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,480
Let's do this!

1646
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,220
Oh my god.

1647
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,400
She's catching speed like crazy!

1648
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:40,910
See ya Avery.

1649
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:44,390
Where's the abandoned building?

1650
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:45,010
Oh my god.

1651
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:48,810
Avery?

1652
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:52,870
I'm riding!

1653
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,320
Shoot.

1654
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:04,550
It's a tight race!

1655
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:05,390
It's a tight race!

1656
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:17,680
Oh my god.

1657
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:18,100
Okay.

1658
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,760
I have to admit, you are good.

1659
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,300
But, I feel like I was just getting warmed up...

1660
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:24,520
No.

1661
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:25,320
No.

1662
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,080
Why not join the marathon?

1663
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:29,100
There's this big race happening today.

1664
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:32,000
Well, it's a little embarrassing but...

1665
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,740
I was supposed to run in the marathon today.

1666
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:35,880
But it turns out I missed registration.

1667
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,700
Sorry, that sucks.

1668
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,440
Yup, I gotta say, I was pretty bummed out.

1669
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,640
Kinda felt like giving up on racing.

1670
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:49,100
Then I spent like two hours watching parkour videos.

1671
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,020
Now my new passion is parkour racing!

1672
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:53,920
So whatever.

1673
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:56,420
I'm glad you were willing to help me practice.

1674
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:00,380
Uh...

1675
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,500
That's it?

1676
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,220
That's all we do?

1677
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,020
Minecraft parkour?

1678
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,920
You think Avery would jump for the beef?

1679
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:07,780
Absolutely.

1680
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,620
Avery would jump for the beef, 100%.

1681
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,360
Wow, we don't get a reward?

1682
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,460
Is it if we do a rematch?

1683
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:21,300
Maybe.

1684
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:27,170
You want a rematch?

1685
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:27,490
Totally!

1686
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:28,890
I'll do better this time.

1687
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:29,870
Oh, where are we going?

1688
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:33,090
Oh, it's the same thing.

1689
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:41,910
I'm just gonna do the same thing I did before.

1690
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:47,350
Uh, I think Avery's way ahead of me.

1691
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:49,450
Wait, Avery, where are you?

1692
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:54,530
Uh...

1693
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:56,950
Wait, where the hell is the...

1694
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:57,770
Where am I going?

1695
01:29:57,770 --> 01:29:59,070
I think I'm lost.

1696
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,450
I think Avery is at the finish line.

1697
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:03,750
Uh...

1698
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:07,730
Where does it go?

1699
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:09,650
Oh.

1700
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:16,570
Birthday was on Jan 1st.

1701
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:17,770
Any chance for a late happy birthday?

1702
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:18,690
Love your video with Kiara.

1703
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:19,970
Also, hope you feel better soon.

1704
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,370
Thank you, Nervous J!

1705
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:23,330
Sorry I missed your birthday.

1706
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:25,150
Happy belated birthday!

1707
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,440
Uh...

1708
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,940
She is zoomed like crazy.

1709
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:44,040
I got lost though.

1710
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,160
I got kinda lost.

1711
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,630
Yeah, look at you all smug up there.

1712
01:30:59,090 --> 01:30:59,590
I won!

1713
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:01,490
You put up a good race.

1714
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:02,690
That was really fun.

1715
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:04,090
Oh!

1716
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:05,410
I nearly forgot.

1717
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:06,590
I've got something for you.

1718
01:31:06,690 --> 01:31:07,190
Oh, okay.

1719
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:09,230
A walkie-talkie.

1720
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,970
If you ever get lost during a race, ring me up and we can start over.

1721
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:17,210
I did get lost.

1722
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:18,910
How did you know?

1723
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:23,910
Bye!

1724
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:26,650
I think I'm good on the rematch.

1725
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:28,050
Unless we actually get something.

1726
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:30,470
I mean, we got a walkie-talkie, but...

1727
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,910
She is too good.

1728
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:41,510
A bit condescending, Avery.

1729
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:51,510
I ducked here earlier.

1730
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:06,970
I dug those up?

1731
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,370
Really?

1732
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,090
No, I did.

1733
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:16,070
No way!

1734
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,250
I did?

1735
01:32:17,930 --> 01:32:20,150
I didn't notice anything covering the ground!

1736
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:49,110
That's a ghost.

1737
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:55,370
Do you remember where you were buried and if you were carrying any valuables?

1738
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:56,090
Just asking.

1739
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:58,670
I don't remember.

1740
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,760
I am...

1741
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,280
Quite possibly the worst person ever.

1742
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,200
Hey, Julie!

1743
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,140
Hi!

1744
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:16,880
How's the day going?

1745
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,600
We're gonna play games all day!

1746
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:20,860
Sounds fun.

1747
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:23,700
Oh, so this is where we play...

1748
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:26,220
Stickball.

1749
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:30,240
Hey, looks like you got the net set up.

1750
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,180
Are you two gonna play volleyball?

1751
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:33,460
Volleyball?

1752
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:33,540
Nah.

1753
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,940
We invented our own game.

1754
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:36,580
No way.

1755
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:38,400
Stickball.

1756
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:39,300
Stickball.

1757
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,100
I think it's gonna be the next big thing.

1758
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:43,480
Alright.

1759
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:44,540
Clear!

1760
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:48,460
I formally challenge you to a game of...

1761
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:57,860
Beach Stickball!

1762
01:34:08,670 --> 01:34:10,390
That means you have to play.

1763
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:11,230
Yeah!

1764
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:12,770
You have to!

1765
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:14,270
It's the law.

1766
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:16,290
You can't fight the law.

1767
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:17,910
Okay, okay.

1768
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:18,750
I'll play.

1769
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:19,310
Yay!

1770
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:20,950
So, how do you play?

1771
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:24,190
Step over to the other side of the court and I'll teach you everything to know.

1772
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:25,010
Okay.

1773
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:30,930
So, Beach Stickball has only three simple rules.

1774
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:33,010
Rule number one.

1775
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:34,930
Hit the ball with your stick.

1776
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,090
Hit it real hard!

1777
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:38,410
Rule number two.

1778
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:40,810
Don't let it hit the ground.

1779
01:34:41,330 --> 01:34:42,630
I mean for the most part.

1780
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:45,410
Julie is the ref so it's all up to her.

1781
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,710
It's all up to me.

1782
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:51,730
Rule number three.

1783
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:53,190
Believe in yourself.

1784
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:55,050
That's the most important rule.

1785
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:56,810
Don't ever forget it.

1786
01:34:57,330 --> 01:34:58,270
That's pretty much it.

1787
01:34:58,750 --> 01:34:59,250
Are you ready?

1788
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:00,410
I guess so.

1789
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:01,730
Ready, set, go!

1790
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:02,730
Oh gosh.

1791
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:03,270
How do I hit?

1792
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:04,050
Okay.

1793
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:06,790
Nice.

1794
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:08,790
Oops.

1795
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:11,050
Oops.

1796
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:12,490
Did I lose?

1797
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:13,250
Nope.

1798
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:15,570
You can never lose.

1799
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:18,570
Nine months is a wisp now.

1800
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:20,170
It's an obvious joke.

1801
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:21,830
I can't believe nine months.

1802
01:35:22,710 --> 01:35:23,090
Wow.

1803
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:27,630
When you play Beach Stickball, everyone wins.

1804
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:29,970
Except if you pop the ball.

1805
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:31,430
Then I guess you lose.

1806
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:35,310
Otherwise, Beach Stickball is a purely co-op game.

1807
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:37,450
Oh, coop game.

1808
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:39,230
You mean co-op game?

1809
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:40,870
Yeah, a coop game.

1810
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:43,830
It means we work together to get a high score.

1811
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:45,070
That sounds nice.

1812
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:47,510
We get a point for every pass we make.

1813
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:50,450
If we can get it to ten points, I'll give you a prize.

1814
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:50,990
Okay.

1815
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:53,410
One.

1816
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:54,770
Two.

1817
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:56,810
Three.

1818
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:58,110
Four.

1819
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:00,050
Five.

1820
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:01,230
Six.

1821
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:03,610
Oh, nice.

1822
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:05,970
Eight.

1823
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:07,650
Ten.

1824
01:36:09,670 --> 01:36:10,110
Ten.

1825
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:12,070
Ten.

1826
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:12,770
Shit.

1827
01:36:13,390 --> 01:36:14,750
Why did you shoot it over there?

1828
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:15,570
Fourteen.

1829
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:17,870
Yes.

1830
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:19,370
We did it.

1831
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:21,430
As promised, I've got a prize for you.

1832
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:23,810
Nine months, please name the child.

1833
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:25,470
Thank you.

1834
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:28,540
Four.

1835
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,100
You're really good.

1836
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,440
With your skill, we might even be able to make it to twenty.

1837
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,580
But that would still be pretty hard.

1838
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:38,180
Do we get a prize if we get to twenty?

1839
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:44,630
Oh.

1840
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:49,330
Oh yeah.

1841
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:50,350
Come on!

1842
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:52,130
Stop hitting it so fast.

1843
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:54,370
How do you count?

1844
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:55,430
I hit seven.

1845
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,730
The serve doesn't count.

1846
01:36:58,530 --> 01:36:59,390
Minky it is.

1847
01:36:59,590 --> 01:36:59,910
Minky!

1848
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:02,770
Shine, bro.

1849
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:03,970
Thank you for the rare.

1850
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:05,010
Hello, hello.

1851
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:08,410
What do you think, Claire?

1852
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:09,710
It counts.

1853
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:11,150
Fine.

1854
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:12,570
You got seven points then.

1855
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:13,710
Alright, let's do it again.

1856
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:15,230
Let's get to twenty.

1857
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:16,410
We're back!

1858
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:19,150
Thanks for the gift.

1859
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:21,530
Sorry.

1860
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:25,490
I

1861
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,680
have a depth perception issues.

1862
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:34,300
Please, little guy.

1863
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:36,120
Why are you there?

1864
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:36,800
Oh my god.

1865
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:37,880
Oh my god, please.

1866
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:42,740
Eleven.

1867
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,580
You never drop the ball.

1868
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,200
Maryland makes it to five.

1869
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,120
True.

1870
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,080
Time to duel.

1871
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,120
I thought this was a co-op game.

1872
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:02,750
That implies no dueling.

1873
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:09,250
What if I hit it the other way?

1874
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:11,690
I don't know if I can.

1875
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,940
Oh, it's a coop game.

1876
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:25,840
Do we get anything?

1877
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:29,940
If we get to twenty.

1878
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:30,940
I wonder.

1879
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:33,540
I want to know.

1880
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:37,850
Oh, nice.

1881
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:39,990
Nice.

1882
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:42,650
Oh, nice.

1883
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:45,030
Nice.

1884
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:49,810
Thirteen.

1885
01:38:49,810 --> 01:38:49,890
Thirteen.

1886
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:53,750
What's your favorite coop game?

1887
01:38:57,590 --> 01:39:01,110
I don't have a favorite coop game, but I have a favorite cool game.

1888
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,130
That's when you overthrow.

1889
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:04,850
Mutiny!

1890
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:07,470
Child support in eight.

1891
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:12,470
A lot of minkys being born today.

1892
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:13,290
Solid.

1893
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:13,470
Solid.

1894
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:32,910
Okay, I'll try one more.

1895
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:35,670
One more!

1896
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:40,290
One more, one more.

1897
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:41,490
Okay.

1898
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:44,330
Nice.

1899
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:47,110
Nice.

1900
01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:51,810
Eleven.

1901
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:53,690
Okay, nevermind.

1902
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:54,250
I give up.

1903
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:55,910
I give up.

1904
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:57,050
I don't care if we...

1905
01:39:57,050 --> 01:39:58,490
Oh, the ball is in here.

1906
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:09,540
I can't even hit it.

1907
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:11,020
I'm the worst.

1908
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:17,880
My depth perception does not allow me to...

1909
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,680
Continue further.

1910
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,680
What is this?

1911
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,520
Oh, the orange island.

1912
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,540
Where is my bucket?

1913
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,220
Ah, nice.

1914
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,460
Oh, not nice.

1915
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:36,960
Nice.

1916
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:37,800
Okay.

1917
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,880
We're back here in the spooky lands.

1918
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:46,100
See, this one just looks like it's waiting to be dug up, you know?

1919
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,940
Maybe it was fresh.

1920
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:56,700
Fresh grave.

1921
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:05,840
We're climbing up.

1922
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:08,420
Oh, this is where we talked to Avery.

1923
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:11,560
What do we see around here?

1924
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:16,630
Oh, no, that's not what I meant to do.

1925
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:19,570
We went there, didn't we?

1926
01:41:20,190 --> 01:41:21,450
I'm almost positive.

1927
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:23,210
We went here and we dug something up.

1928
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:25,750
Is this a horror game?

1929
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,250
No, it's actually not.

1930
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:28,930
Surprisingly.

1931
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:40,390
Okay.

1932
01:41:43,150 --> 01:41:44,670
Don't get electrified.

1933
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:45,310
Can you?

1934
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:47,970
This game wouldn't kill us, would it?

1935
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:51,210
Alright.

1936
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:53,070
Time to climb.

1937
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:57,310
It is time to climb the Hawk Trail.

1938
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:59,590
Finally.

1939
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:01,050
What's this?

1940
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:02,570
Hawk Peak Trail.

1941
01:42:02,570 --> 01:42:03,630
Welcome back, Mito.

1942
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:04,830
Hope you had a nice break.

1943
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:05,430
Miss you so much.

1944
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:06,150
Thanks, Daniel!

1945
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:10,630
Thank you, thank you.

1946
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:13,770
We're climbing.

1947
01:42:14,690 --> 01:42:15,350
This is it.

1948
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:16,970
This is the moment.

1949
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:19,930
This is what we've been training for.

1950
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:23,170
What's this way?

1951
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:24,950
Hawk Peak Trail.

1952
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:25,590
This way.

1953
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:29,050
This way?

1954
01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:30,870
Am I going the right way?

1955
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:31,870
Yeah.

1956
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:33,730
Okay, this way.

1957
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:35,150
We're climbing.

1958
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:37,330
We're finally doing it.

1959
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:39,970
We're completing the game.

1960
01:42:41,930 --> 01:42:44,310
This is game completion music for real.

1961
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:47,610
Oh, I'm drowning.

1962
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:50,330
I'm gonna talk to this dog.

1963
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:51,230
Heyo.

1964
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:53,170
How's the hike treating you?

1965
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:56,150
It's been nice.

1966
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:57,630
It's really beautiful here.

1967
01:42:58,190 --> 01:42:58,770
I know, right?

1968
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:03,190
The view from the top will be so good!

1969
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:06,290
You're going to Hawk Peak too?

1970
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:07,330
Oh, no.

1971
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,010
That's too intense for me.

1972
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:11,270
I'm just going to Outlook Point.

1973
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:12,810
Will I see you there?

1974
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:15,170
Yeah, I'll meet you at the top.

1975
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:16,310
Awesome.

1976
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:17,670
Catch you later.

1977
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:22,150
Is that a stick?

1978
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:25,230
No, I think that maybe it's just a shadow.

1979
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:26,110
Oh, I'm drowning.

1980
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:26,830
Oh, dog.

1981
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:31,470
Hawk Peak.

1982
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:32,890
Oh, dog.

1983
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:33,570
I gotta go.

1984
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:34,370
I'm faster than you.

1985
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:35,070
Let me through.

1986
01:43:37,890 --> 01:43:39,030
Wait, which way do I go?

1987
01:43:42,110 --> 01:43:42,870
Outlook Point.

1988
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:43,310
Okay.

1989
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:50,090
Guys, I hope you're not afraid of heights.

1990
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:52,290
Treasure.

1991
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,160
Oh, a golden feather!

1992
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:03,200
Nice.

1993
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,420
I got seven now.

1994
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:14,770
I remember Avery saying that she tied the ribbon around the...

1995
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:16,470
I don't think we've been there yet.

1996
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:18,590
The lighthouse.

1997
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:19,690
Oh, wait.

1998
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:19,950
No.

1999
01:44:20,270 --> 01:44:20,630
Didn't...

2000
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:20,850
No.

2001
01:44:21,450 --> 01:44:23,090
I was going to say, didn't I try climbing it?

2002
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:24,310
Well, that's a big mountain.

2003
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:28,310
Golden feather.

2004
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:30,990
Down there.

2005
01:44:32,910 --> 01:44:33,390
Interesting.

2006
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:34,930
Okay.

2007
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:36,270
Wait, dog!

2008
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:37,150
Dog!

2009
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:37,950
Dog.

2010
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:38,710
Dog!

2011
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:41,970
Heyo.

2012
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:43,550
I was just up at Outlook Point.

2013
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:45,050
I didn't see you there though.

2014
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:45,690
Oops.

2015
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:47,010
Oh.

2016
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:48,670
But I was there!

2017
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:53,450
Okay, let's wait for dog to come back.

2018
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:58,090
I wish I could see what's inside here.

2019
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:02,410
Stupid dog, I'm right here.

2020
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,990
Literally at the point.

2021
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:09,590
Stupid dog.

2022
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:11,010
Idiot.

2023
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:12,190
Dummy dog.

2024
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:14,110
So my cats are better.

2025
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:19,790
Breathe in that fresh air, guys.

2026
01:45:20,610 --> 01:45:22,950
I hope you don't have a stuffed nose like me.

2027
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:29,530
Okay, golden feather.

2028
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:32,590
Coins.

2029
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:33,710
Oh, my goodness.

2030
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:34,050
Okay.

2031
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:36,110
What's wrong with my controller?

2032
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:38,750
What's wrong with my controller?

2033
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:42,270
Why am I on turbo?

2034
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:45,490
How do I turn it off?

2035
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:46,710
Oh, my god.

2036
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:47,770
I don't want to...

2037
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:49,510
Oh, god.

2038
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:52,710
I turned on turbo mode on.

2039
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:54,870
I think on my controller I don't know how to turn it off.

2040
01:46:01,570 --> 01:46:02,750
Does anyone know?

2041
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:08,930
Hold the turbo button.

2042
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:09,790
The button that's turbo...

2043
01:46:09,790 --> 01:46:11,410
I didn't hold any other button, though.

2044
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:16,770
Oh, gosh.

2045
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:18,430
It's...

2046
01:46:19,150 --> 01:46:20,390
What is this?

2047
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:23,750
I can't remember the name of it right now.

2048
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:24,030
Hold on.

2049
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,000
I have the 8-bit Dolan.

2050
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:36,500
The 8-bit...

2051
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:39,200
I knew that I had turbo, but I never use it.

2052
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:44,080
Unplug.

2053
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,300
It's not plugged in.

2054
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:45,820
It's Bluetooth.

2055
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:48,380
Maybe if I...

2056
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:49,460
Maybe if I...

2057
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:56,180
Maybe that.

2058
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:00,960
Alright,

2059
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:04,240
dog.

2060
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:05,960
I'm here.

2061
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:08,000
I'm at the sneaky point.

2062
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:11,640
How long is this dog gonna take?

2063
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:11,960
I wonder.

2064
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:18,450
Oh, my God.

2065
01:47:18,490 --> 01:47:20,090
He's not even anywhere by us.

2066
01:47:20,690 --> 01:47:21,290
Dog?

2067
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:23,830
Dog?

2068
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:24,750
Oh, my God!

2069
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:25,810
He's still going down!

2070
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:28,990
We'll come back.

2071
01:47:31,670 --> 01:47:32,270
We'll...

2072
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:34,410
We'll...

2073
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:36,490
We'll come back for him.

2074
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:45,110
I'm climbing.

2075
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:47,170
I saw that treasure chest.

2076
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:49,410
Huck Peak.

2077
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:50,190
Meteor...

2078
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:51,250
Oh, the Meteor Lake.

2079
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:52,570
We haven't been there yet either.

2080
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:57,470
Let's go up top first.

2081
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:01,650
You can grab that golden feather first.

2082
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:04,830
True.

2083
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:08,270
We could attempt that.

2084
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:10,990
Alright, dog's gotta be here now.

2085
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:14,470
I'm running.

2086
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:15,650
I'm running.

2087
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:16,670
Dog!

2088
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:17,570
Dog!

2089
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:25,030
Where was it though?

2090
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:29,010
I just know it's this direction.

2091
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:30,910
Doesn't seem very far.

2092
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:33,770
Oh, sorry.

2093
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:43,370
Okay, here we go.

2094
01:48:44,110 --> 01:48:45,670
Still trying to wait for him, but...

2095
01:48:47,770 --> 01:48:48,570
That

2096
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:56,930
was so smooth.

2097
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:04,930
Now I'm...

2098
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:07,690
Oh, that's a turtle.

2099
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:11,470
So now we're in the Blackwood area.

2100
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:13,470
Nice flying, thank you.

2101
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:15,350
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

2102
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:16,170
I meant to do this.

2103
01:49:17,110 --> 01:49:17,930
And we're going...

2104
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:20,210
this way.

2105
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:24,730
Run, run, run.

2106
01:49:25,090 --> 01:49:25,850
Run, you...

2107
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:26,130
Oh, okay.

2108
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:27,790
Dog is on his way back!

2109
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:29,850
Let's just follow him.

2110
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:38,070
I won't leave you behind this time.

2111
01:49:40,930 --> 01:49:42,090
This epic journey.

2112
01:49:42,210 --> 01:49:43,150
You and me, dog.

2113
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:44,970
You and me.

2114
01:49:45,090 --> 01:49:46,010
Oh, I'm drowning, dog.

2115
01:49:47,190 --> 01:49:47,950
Oh, no.

2116
01:49:48,270 --> 01:49:49,150
I'm drowning, I'm drowning.

2117
01:49:49,890 --> 01:49:50,170
Okay.

2118
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:51,350
Okay.

2119
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:52,370
Come on.

2120
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:53,450
Come on.

2121
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:57,030
I'm a new bird.

2122
01:49:57,290 --> 01:49:58,670
I grew a new feather.

2123
01:49:59,730 --> 01:50:00,030
Raiders?

2124
01:50:00,290 --> 01:50:01,170
Oh, Julius.

2125
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:02,490
Thanks for the raid.

2126
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:04,130
Hello, hello.

2127
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:05,810
Nice to meet ya.

2128
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:07,630
This way.

2129
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:09,390
We're trying to get this dog to the top.

2130
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:12,530
Look, he's got not a single thought behind his eyes.

2131
01:50:12,990 --> 01:50:14,670
He's just a dog.

2132
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:16,550
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

2133
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:18,270
Come on, come on.

2134
01:50:18,610 --> 01:50:19,710
Come on, come on.

2135
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:21,730
I said I'd meet you there, buddy.

2136
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:23,850
I'm gonna meet you there.

2137
01:50:24,530 --> 01:50:25,430
Come here, come here.

2138
01:50:26,290 --> 01:50:27,210
Thanks for the gifted.

2139
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:29,370
Okay, okay, okay.

2140
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:33,270
Hey!

2141
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:35,030
Good to see you up here.

2142
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:36,430
Is it just me?

2143
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:37,890
Or is this kind of epic?

2144
01:50:37,890 --> 01:50:40,070
Yay, thanks for the power of gifted.

2145
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:43,230
Yeah, it's epic.

2146
01:50:44,330 --> 01:50:44,850
Yes!

2147
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:47,950
The wind in my face.

2148
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:49,990
It makes me feel so good.

2149
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:52,490
Wind makes me feel good.

2150
01:50:53,150 --> 01:50:55,210
The visitor center is so tiny from here.

2151
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:58,570
Oh, that reminds me.

2152
01:50:58,990 --> 01:50:59,530
Take this.

2153
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:03,090
Wait, I forgot we got a treasure map before.

2154
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:06,250
Apparently, there's some sort of treasure buried at Sid Beach.

2155
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:07,630
I couldn't find anything.

2156
01:51:07,730 --> 01:51:08,850
Maybe I'll have better luck.

2157
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:10,190
That's right!

2158
01:51:10,290 --> 01:51:12,330
We got two treasure maps now!

2159
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:13,310
Oh my gosh.

2160
01:51:13,890 --> 01:51:14,500
So worth!

2161
01:51:14,990 --> 01:51:15,650
Let's go!

2162
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:23,890
Okay.

2163
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:27,010
Sid Beach.

2164
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:29,610
Don't know where that is at all.

2165
01:51:33,330 --> 01:51:35,110
Let's just keep climbing for now.

2166
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:36,070
There might be more.

2167
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:41,950
I wonder if they're like, you gotta get all the feathers to get to the top though, buddy.

2168
01:51:43,490 --> 01:51:45,110
This looks a little ominous.

2169
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:50,410
I think I stole someone's way back home.

2170
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:54,670
Stick, stick.

2171
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:57,350
Whoa, this guy's too cool.

2172
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:58,830
Hey, king.

2173
01:51:59,430 --> 01:52:00,870
You wanna buy some golden feathers?

2174
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:04,710
Yeah, okay.

2175
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,510
Cool.

2176
01:52:07,010 --> 01:52:08,910
It'll be 100 coins per feather.

2177
01:52:09,710 --> 01:52:12,950
But, that's more than twice as much as the visitor center.

2178
01:52:14,090 --> 01:52:16,070
I thought the visitor center was...

2179
01:52:16,990 --> 01:52:17,810
100 also.

2180
01:52:19,610 --> 01:52:20,630
Scalper, yeah!

2181
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:24,850
Yeah, drown in piss, scalper!

2182
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:27,090
Oh, it's 40.

2183
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:29,350
Go buy feathers from them then.

2184
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:31,650
But, they're all sold out!

2185
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:34,270
I guess you're out of luck.

2186
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:36,350
Oh my god, so many raids today.

2187
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:38,410
Ladies, saffron, thank you for the raid!

2188
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:43,370
So, you're gonna buy my feathers or what?

2189
01:52:44,150 --> 01:52:45,370
This guy's a jerk.

2190
01:52:47,190 --> 01:52:47,710
Fine.

2191
01:52:48,790 --> 01:52:50,150
Alright then, pay up.

2192
01:52:52,370 --> 01:52:53,190
Nine feathers.

2193
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:55,150
Smell ya later.

2194
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:56,730
Don't do it.

2195
01:52:56,790 --> 01:52:58,730
I had to, I think.

2196
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:02,350
At least seven golden feathers are required to complete...

2197
01:53:03,190 --> 01:53:03,790
Novice...

2198
01:53:05,290 --> 01:53:06,890
Look at this guy climbing.

2199
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:09,430
Novice hikers should consider using more.

2200
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:10,890
I'm no novice!

2201
01:53:11,290 --> 01:53:12,570
Maybe I shouldn't have bought it then.

2202
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:17,910
I shouldn't have bought it.

2203
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:19,230
I didn't need it.

2204
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:22,530
Oh, it's our guy.

2205
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:23,550
Oh, hey!

2206
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:26,350
Seems like you've really gotten the hang of climbing.

2207
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:31,090
Thank you for the gift.

2208
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:32,490
Yeah!

2209
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:35,850
I think I'm stuck!

2210
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:38,330
It's too high!

2211
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:39,750
What have I done?

2212
01:53:40,090 --> 01:53:40,950
I can't do this.

2213
01:53:41,310 --> 01:53:43,170
Take a deep breath.

2214
01:53:43,650 --> 01:53:44,990
Try and remain calm.

2215
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:46,450
You're doing great.

2216
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:48,790
And you know you can handle this.

2217
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:51,490
This guy, this is karma.

2218
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:53,930
What am I doing?

2219
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:56,850
Just focus on the next step.

2220
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:58,550
You've got this!

2221
01:53:59,090 --> 01:54:00,130
I've got this!

2222
01:54:00,570 --> 01:54:01,570
I've got this!

2223
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:05,330
I hope you fall and break every bone in your body, buddy.

2224
01:54:12,710 --> 01:54:14,070
Let's travel this way.

2225
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:20,390
Nice.

2226
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:22,250
Okay, bye!

2227
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:23,970
Thanks for the five gifts.

2228
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:28,790
Nice.

2229
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:31,250
Very good.

2230
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:33,090
Our feathers are getting frozen!

2231
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:36,490
That's not good.

2232
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:41,710
Oh no!

2233
01:54:45,970 --> 01:54:46,730
Hello?

2234
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:55,350
Heat.

2235
01:54:59,310 --> 01:55:01,050
Hold on there, young friend.

2236
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:05,310
I hope you don't mind me saying, but you seem a little unpre- I do?

2237
01:55:06,030 --> 01:55:06,430
Unprepared!

2238
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:08,890
It's mighty cold up here for folks who aren't accustomed.

2239
01:55:09,650 --> 01:55:11,450
I didn't expect it to get this cold!

2240
01:55:12,130 --> 01:55:13,430
My feathers are freezing up!

2241
01:55:14,110 --> 01:55:18,150
Hawk Peak is unique in the province for geothermal activity.

2242
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:19,970
Oh, it was a hot spring.

2243
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:23,350
I thought it was like the other one earlier where it was the gust of wind, you know?

2244
01:55:24,430 --> 01:55:26,870
If you get too chilly, stop at one of the hot springs.

2245
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:29,070
That should give you back your strength.

2246
01:55:33,250 --> 01:55:34,950
You guys, do you think we're gonna make it?

2247
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:39,150
What is this?

2248
01:55:40,570 --> 01:55:42,230
This looks like a place to dig.

2249
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:48,650
Oh, wrong thing.

2250
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:50,570
Shovel.

2251
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:02,330
I think you can do it, streamer.

2252
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:03,670
You think so?

2253
01:56:03,730 --> 01:56:04,710
You really think so?

2254
01:56:05,130 --> 01:56:08,070
You think we can get to Hawk Peak?

2255
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:09,010
The top?

2256
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:17,240
Oh, it's getting mighty, mighty breezy.

2257
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,260
Hey,

2258
01:56:28,630 --> 01:56:29,170
it's you again.

2259
01:56:29,810 --> 01:56:33,470
We're almost at the top, but it looks like the bridge collapsed.

2260
01:56:34,150 --> 01:56:39,310
There might be another way up, or I could just go collect more golden feathers.

2261
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:44,910
This is kind of epic here.

2262
01:56:49,630 --> 01:56:51,530
No, I'm so close!

2263
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:54,490
No, I'm so close!

2264
01:56:55,970 --> 01:56:57,270
I don't think I'll make it.

2265
01:57:01,310 --> 01:57:03,670
There's hot springs right there!

2266
01:57:09,710 --> 01:57:10,290
No!

2267
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:15,070
No!

2268
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:16,730
Maybe let's go back to this one over here.

2269
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:26,000
Maybe up here.

2270
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,260
There was a hot springs up here.

2271
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:31,060
I saw it.

2272
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,580
Oh gosh!

2273
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:35,520
No!

2274
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:36,860
Are you kidding me?

2275
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:39,480
So lame.

2276
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,020
Oh, I just noticed the shiny over here.

2277
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:44,100
Oh, and a treasure chest.

2278
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:48,700
You guys, we still haven't found that guy's watch.

2279
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:49,620
Isn't that kind of crazy?

2280
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:54,220
Hot springs are hot.

2281
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:57,440
Hot springs, hot springs.

2282
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:01,720
I already lost a feather.

2283
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:02,420
I don't know how.

2284
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:05,040
Let's warm up.

2285
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:07,980
Maybe I can climb in here.

2286
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:09,800
Alright.

2287
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:12,760
To up here.

2288
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,040
I think I'm a little taller now.

2289
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:16,580
Than before.

2290
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:35,830
Let's try this way.

2291
01:58:42,330 --> 01:58:44,230
Don't use up a feather, don't use up a feather.

2292
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:49,290
I think this goes to... I saw another collapsed bridge.

2293
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:52,150
There's a fireplace here.

2294
01:58:53,230 --> 01:58:54,130
That's good.

2295
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:56,630
What's in here?

2296
01:58:57,050 --> 01:58:57,570
Nothing?

2297
01:58:57,790 --> 01:58:57,950
OK.

2298
01:58:59,370 --> 01:58:59,970
Saladoa.

2299
01:59:00,330 --> 01:59:01,390
Welcome to Mambo Shop.

2300
01:59:01,430 --> 01:59:02,330
Thank you!

2301
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:07,670
Oh no.

2302
01:59:08,930 --> 01:59:10,390
Oh yes, oh yes.

2303
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:12,530
Oh yes, oh yes.

2304
01:59:15,430 --> 01:59:17,230
I feel like we are going down?

2305
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:21,570
There's fish in that hot spring.

2306
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:25,970
Let's fish a little.

2307
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:28,750
We might get a rare guy.

2308
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:40,690
Pre-cooked fish.

2309
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:46,020
This is nice.

2310
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:48,740
Mintos Mt.

2311
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:50,200
Everest arc came so soon.

2312
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:55,650
I want to climb Mt.

2313
01:59:55,730 --> 01:59:55,990
Everest.

2314
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:09,070
White bass.

2315
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:15,130
Can we fill our bucket here, I wonder?

2316
02:00:17,530 --> 02:00:18,570
We can.

2317
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:21,490
And then... OK.

2318
02:00:22,030 --> 02:00:22,290
OK.

2319
02:00:22,670 --> 02:00:23,350
Hear me out.

2320
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:27,390
Let's just equip this guy instead.

2321
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:34,390
We go back to over here where I climbed up and there was a little...

2322
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:36,390
Oh, I'm stuck.

2323
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:39,350
There was a little plant we can...

2324
02:00:42,630 --> 02:00:44,730
We can water.

2325
02:00:48,010 --> 02:00:48,570
OK.

2326
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:48,850
OK.

2327
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:48,990
OK.

2328
02:00:54,610 --> 02:00:55,330
Oh.

2329
02:01:00,690 --> 02:01:01,410
Oops.

2330
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:08,690
We

2331
02:01:32,230 --> 02:01:34,630
know this way is pretty much a bust.

2332
02:01:36,650 --> 02:01:38,110
Let's fly around.

2333
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:40,810
Wait a second.

2334
02:01:41,610 --> 02:01:45,930
I think this is a... I think this is a shark guy.

2335
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:48,430
Maybe.

2336
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:50,010
Or is this...

2337
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:54,730
OK.

2338
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:55,270
Nice.

2339
02:01:57,650 --> 02:01:59,090
That works.

2340
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:05,380
Don't waste feathers.

2341
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:07,180
OK.

2342
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:07,700
Try climbing.

2343
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:14,740
I still don't have enough.

2344
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,720
Maybe I do need to keep gathering feathers.

2345
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:26,140
It says 7 minimum.

2346
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:27,500
How the heck?

2347
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:29,540
How the heck?

2348
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:47,970
Just another dollar.

2349
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:03,440
Maybe...

2350
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:05,540
Wait a second.

2351
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:06,280
Wait a second.

2352
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:17,040
Now we are here.

2353
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:22,180
Now we are here.

2354
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:26,760
Wait.

2355
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:27,240
OK.

2356
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:28,600
Now if I do this.

2357
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:29,440
Equip.

2358
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:31,980
Fill.

2359
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:34,280
Go down.

2360
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:35,980
Water.

2361
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:39,980
I guess this is a pretty good height.

2362
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:46,480
What if I just go for it?

2363
02:04:13,930 --> 02:04:15,490
I did it!

2364
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:21,470
Now he's gonna... No!

2365
02:04:21,550 --> 02:04:22,130
Don't sit down!

2366
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:23,390
Don't fall asleep!

2367
02:04:23,670 --> 02:04:25,570
You'll die of hypothermia!

2368
02:04:26,070 --> 02:04:27,370
That's my streamer.

2369
02:04:29,950 --> 02:04:31,230
So peaceful.

2370
02:04:32,210 --> 02:04:34,490
The Aurora Borealis.

2371
02:04:40,290 --> 02:04:41,410
Is that it?

2372
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:47,580
Is the world fading away or is it just me?

2373
02:04:50,690 --> 02:04:51,800
The reception!

2374
02:04:53,980 --> 02:04:55,340
Cellphone reception!

2375
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:57,760
Hello?

2376
02:04:58,620 --> 02:04:59,200
Hi Claire.

2377
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:00,200
Mom!

2378
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:00,560
Mom!

2379
02:05:02,980 --> 02:05:05,920
Is that the phone call we were waiting for?

2380
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:06,800
Thank you for the 5k.

2381
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:07,620
Thank you.

2382
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:10,840
I'm so glad to hear from you.

2383
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:17,910
I've been waiting all day to hear from you.

2384
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:20,950
I've been worried.

2385
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:22,170
Oh honey.

2386
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:24,210
I told you I'd be fine.

2387
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:28,270
But you always say that.

2388
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:30,530
Why is it so annoying right now?

2389
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:32,350
And I always am.

2390
02:05:33,550 --> 02:05:34,230
Anyway.

2391
02:05:35,650 --> 02:05:36,470
How have you been?

2392
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:41,630
I'm at the top of Hawk Peak right now.

2393
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:46,490
I love it up there.

2394
02:05:48,070 --> 02:05:50,950
Mei and I used to go up every summer together.

2395
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:53,370
It's about time you made it up.

2396
02:05:54,670 --> 02:05:55,730
Yeah, I know.

2397
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:58,350
You're so big now.

2398
02:06:00,710 --> 02:06:02,890
My little girl is leaving the nest.

2399
02:06:03,530 --> 02:06:04,530
Why is this so...

2400
02:06:07,790 --> 02:06:10,850
You won't have any need for little old mom.

2401
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:13,310
But I do need you.

2402
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:16,110
I'll never not need you.

2403
02:06:18,350 --> 02:06:20,250
When I heard about the surgery.

2404
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:24,130
How come you never told me this was a thing?

2405
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:26,770
I didn't want you to worry.

2406
02:06:26,770 --> 02:06:31,910
But I know you can get worked up about things.

2407
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:34,890
I could have been there for you.

2408
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:37,470
You're all alone there now.

2409
02:06:38,290 --> 02:06:39,590
Really, it was nothing.

2410
02:06:40,630 --> 02:06:41,990
Everything was fine.

2411
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:44,550
Why is this so sad?

2412
02:06:47,030 --> 02:06:48,670
I'm just glad you're okay.

2413
02:06:49,870 --> 02:06:51,170
I love you mom.

2414
02:06:51,890 --> 02:06:52,870
I love you too.

2415
02:06:58,590 --> 02:07:00,270
Wait, something's happening.

2416
02:07:08,570 --> 02:07:11,110
Is that the famous Hawk Peak updraft?

2417
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:14,450
Looks like it.

2418
02:07:15,490 --> 02:07:17,170
You should catch a ride on it now.

2419
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:18,970
Before it fizzles out.

2420
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:21,550
I wanna, but I'm kinda nervous.

2421
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:24,890
Claire, you can do it.

2422
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:27,150
I'll come visit you soon, okay?

2423
02:07:28,430 --> 02:07:31,390
Also, don't forget to say hi to Aunt May for me.

2424
02:07:32,330 --> 02:07:34,150
She's probably waiting for you back at the cottage.

2425
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:36,710
Bye, love you.

2426
02:07:37,770 --> 02:07:38,930
Love you too mom.

2427
02:07:41,410 --> 02:07:43,450
Hawk Peak, you made it to the top.

2428
02:07:46,830 --> 02:07:48,390
What the heck?

2429
02:07:53,410 --> 02:07:55,770
I don't need my nose to be any more stuck.

2430
02:07:57,150 --> 02:07:58,590
Hold on, I want a fish in here.

2431
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:08,300
The music got all exciting and I'm like, give me a fish.

2432
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,800
Look, we sat down, so cute.

2433
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:17,160
Probably get some good fish in here.

2434
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,560
Big white bass.

2435
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:27,800
Another one.

2436
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:32,120
What if we catch a tuna?

2437
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:34,080
Hawk tuna.

2438
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,440
Another big white bass.

2439
02:08:44,380 --> 02:08:45,720
Hawk Peak, fly.

2440
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:47,440
No, no, no, stop!

2441
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:49,900
This is a wholesome game.

2442
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:53,020
This is a wholesome game.

2443
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,580
Okay, last try.

2444
02:09:02,030 --> 02:09:03,090
And jump.

2445
02:09:08,690 --> 02:09:11,110
Only white bass here.

2446
02:09:21,610 --> 02:09:26,270
I wanted to go this way maybe.

2447
02:09:29,310 --> 02:09:30,870
What about Meteor Lake?

2448
02:09:31,350 --> 02:09:32,410
We didn't get to go.

2449
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:33,410
Oh, I'm freezing up.

2450
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:43,460
I can't see anything.

2451
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:46,700
We're too high up.

2452
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:48,860
I don't know where we are at all.

2453
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:52,160
Where's those graves I dug up?

2454
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:55,400
Dive down?

2455
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:03,820
We really start to, like, just nose dive when we do that.

2456
02:10:05,060 --> 02:10:06,260
A little scary.

2457
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:07,840
Oh yeah, we've been here.

2458
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:14,500
There we go.

2459
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,500
I think we can go home from here.

2460
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:27,420
Where was that boat?

2461
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:29,140
I don't remember.

2462
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:33,380
What's that?

2463
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:35,040
Wait, what's this?

2464
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:36,620
Hold on.

2465
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:39,820
Oh wait, I did go through here, but it's blocked, isn't it?

2466
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:43,280
Dang it.

2467
02:10:47,660 --> 02:10:49,900
I think it's like right over here.

2468
02:10:51,220 --> 02:10:51,680
I think.

2469
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:54,140
I think it's like right...

2470
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:55,400
Sand Castle.

2471
02:10:56,660 --> 02:10:57,860
Yeah, I was right.

2472
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:01,000
Hey, did you make it to the top?

2473
02:11:01,740 --> 02:11:01,940
Yeah.

2474
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:04,660
It was really nice.

2475
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:06,740
Yeah, we'd have to find the exit, right?

2476
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:08,780
I can see why you like it so much.

2477
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,960
Though, it wasn't exactly a short hike.

2478
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:13,980
I'm really tired.

2479
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,140
Well, maybe that was a bit of an understatement.

2480
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:19,700
Only a bit.

2481
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:21,500
It's kind of been a busy day.

2482
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:22,480
Oh yeah?

2483
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:23,980
What have you been up to?

2484
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:26,900
Well, I caught a really rare fish.

2485
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:29,260
Since when did you learn to fish?

2486
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:31,080
Just today.

2487
02:11:31,780 --> 02:11:32,080
Wow.

2488
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:34,380
You have been busy.

2489
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:35,220
That's all I did.

2490
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:37,900
All I did was catch a rare fish.

2491
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:40,760
Also, I played a game of beach stickball.

2492
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:42,600
What's beach stickball?

2493
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:45,140
It's some game the kids play.

2494
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,380
They're always playing something new.

2495
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,980
You can't keep up with the youth these days.

2496
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:53,780
Oh, I won a parkour race today.

2497
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:54,360
Yeah, I did.

2498
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:55,380
Wow.

2499
02:11:56,460 --> 02:11:57,460
What's parkour?

2500
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:01,560
It's like jumping around and climbing stuff.

2501
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:03,280
That sounds fun.

2502
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:04,340
Anywho.

2503
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:05,360
You hungry?

2504
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:08,820
I'm gonna break out the hotdog soon.

2505
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:12,220
Well, I'm kind of tired out.

2506
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:14,200
I'm gonna go take a nap or something.

2507
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:15,640
Alrighty then.

2508
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:16,920
Have a good one.

2509
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:21,880
I think it'd be nice to take a break.

2510
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:27,670
The end.

2511
02:12:29,470 --> 02:12:30,910
Did we get the hotdog?

2512
02:12:39,230 --> 02:12:41,470
Did we get the hotdog?

2513
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:47,630
Thanks for all the hotdogs!

2514
02:12:48,450 --> 02:12:50,110
No hotdog, bad end.

2515
02:12:55,610 --> 02:12:58,490
This song kind of reminds me of Over the Garden Wall.

2516
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:00,010
Loveliest?

2517
02:13:04,610 --> 02:13:05,070
Luckiest?

2518
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:06,450
I don't remember the words, sorry.

2519
02:13:08,430 --> 02:13:09,470
Oh, the end.

2520
02:13:09,550 --> 02:13:11,130
Take a nice long nap.

2521
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:15,750
And I guess that's it.

2522
02:13:15,870 --> 02:13:16,610
Well, hold on.

2523
02:13:16,690 --> 02:13:17,410
Let me see.

2524
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:20,410
I feel I didn't...

2525
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:20,730
Okay.

2526
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:23,550
There's quite a few...

2527
02:13:26,590 --> 02:13:27,710
Achievements I didn't get.

2528
02:13:27,870 --> 02:13:29,230
Oh, so collect 10 feathers.

2529
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:30,910
10 golden feathers is an achievement.

2530
02:13:31,510 --> 02:13:32,270
Parkour master.

2531
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:34,330
Beat each parkour race once.

2532
02:13:34,910 --> 02:13:35,570
Feathers forever.

2533
02:13:35,570 --> 02:13:36,850
Water find every feather.

2534
02:13:37,690 --> 02:13:39,750
Trade every species of fish from the journal.

2535
02:13:40,270 --> 02:13:41,350
Complete the boating challenge.

2536
02:13:41,410 --> 02:13:43,110
Oh, we didn't even do the boat.

2537
02:13:43,710 --> 02:13:45,130
Water every sprout.

2538
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:46,790
And then there's four hidden achievements.

2539
02:13:49,970 --> 02:13:51,130
That's a short game.

2540
02:13:51,490 --> 02:13:52,470
Well, it was a short hike.

2541
02:13:53,230 --> 02:13:54,650
Yeah, we didn't do the boat.

2542
02:13:56,130 --> 02:13:57,370
I think that's okay though.

2543
02:13:58,630 --> 02:13:59,830
This was so cute.

2544
02:14:00,510 --> 02:14:02,010
One down, 49 to go.

2545
02:14:02,630 --> 02:14:04,470
Congrats on beating your first game of 2035.

2546
02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:06,610
Yeah, you're so right.

2547
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:07,810
Oh my gosh.

2548
02:14:07,930 --> 02:14:09,190
Thank you.

2549
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:11,450
Thank you, thank you.

2550
02:14:13,450 --> 02:14:15,410
100%'ing this takes a bit longer.

2551
02:14:15,530 --> 02:14:16,270
It's still a short game.

2552
02:14:16,370 --> 02:14:17,610
How many fish are there?

2553
02:14:17,870 --> 02:14:20,650
Usually in these types of games, I feel like there's...

2554
02:14:20,650 --> 02:14:22,090
Hundreds of fish, you know?

2555
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:31,220
I don't mind today as being a little bit shorter of a stream though.

2556
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,520
Because I...

2557
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:34,880
Do kind of need to rest up.

2558
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:36,740
And I have an event.

2559
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:41,240
In just a few hours.

2560
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:42,160
Actually.

2561
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:44,440
That was a cozy stream.

2562
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:45,720
Thanks, Mindy.

2563
02:14:47,740 --> 02:14:48,180
Mindy.

2564
02:14:50,020 --> 02:14:51,880
This was the web fishing guy too, right?

2565
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:52,760
Was it?

2566
02:14:59,070 --> 02:15:00,090
I don't know.

2567
02:15:07,010 --> 02:15:07,830
I think...

2568
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:09,290
Wasn't this the pumpkin game?

2569
02:15:09,370 --> 02:15:10,410
Yeah, I was thinking that too.

2570
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:14,150
I was thinking that too, the pumpkin game.

2571
02:15:14,150 --> 02:15:17,510
The one that we did...

2572
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:18,550
The pumpkin festival.

2573
02:15:21,330 --> 02:15:22,150
No, wait.

2574
02:15:22,250 --> 02:15:23,090
That was different.

2575
02:15:23,230 --> 02:15:24,150
It showed a fox.

2576
02:15:24,290 --> 02:15:25,350
Not a...

2577
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:27,250
Not a bird.

2578
02:15:30,230 --> 02:15:31,990
I don't know.

2579
02:15:34,050 --> 02:15:34,730
I'm gonna see.

2580
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:35,330
Hold on.

2581
02:15:36,890 --> 02:15:37,610
A...

2582
02:15:37,610 --> 02:15:39,090
Short hike.

2583
02:15:42,130 --> 02:15:42,850
Dev.

2584
02:15:49,220 --> 02:15:49,800
No.

2585
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:51,320
Oh, what is this?

2586
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:57,820
Is this...

2587
02:15:57,820 --> 02:15:59,420
Is this the only game?

2588
02:15:59,660 --> 02:16:01,220
Hold on, I'm gonna look on Steam instead.

2589
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:03,600
Store page.

2590
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:08,060
Oh, here's a couple.

2591
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:10,120
A tiny hike.

2592
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:13,320
And pitfall planet.

2593
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:15,420
It looks like a platformer.

2594
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:17,440
This one was so cute.

2595
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,960
The cozy stream bundle.

2596
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:22,280
Cozy.

2597
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:26,600
If you like this, you should check Celeste.

2598
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:27,260
I think...

2599
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:30,160
Celeste is...

2600
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:31,300
Not cozy.

2601
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:34,340
I think Celeste...

2602
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:37,180
I think...

2603
02:16:37,540 --> 02:16:40,940
I think maybe you see mountain and you're like...

2604
02:16:40,940 --> 02:16:42,360
Yeah, Celeste.

2605
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:45,880
I think it's a little bit different.

2606
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:51,000
Maybe.

2607
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:57,880
Just become a platforming god and it will be super chill.

2608
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:58,700
True.

2609
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,520
One screen took me over 500 tries.

2610
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:06,420
I think I'd have to be in a complete Zen mode.

2611
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:07,420
To...

2612
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:09,640
To attempt Celeste.

2613
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:13,060
I would have to be like...

2614
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:13,980
Today...

2615
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:15,860
I will not rage.

2616
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:17,220
Today...

2617
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:19,320
We are Zen.

2618
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:21,320
Today we are...

2619
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:25,320
Free of all...

2620
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,100
Of all rages.

2621
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:31,780
Which is like...

2622
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:33,260
Never for me.

2623
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:34,820
Zen gaming.

2624
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:38,500
Cozy depends on the individual.

2625
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:40,780
Hollow Knight is my cozy game.

2626
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:42,960
I mean, yes, that is very true.

2627
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:47,880
Hollow Knight.

2628
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:51,200
I don't know what my cozy game is.

2629
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:52,600
Minecraft?

2630
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:54,720
Hollow Cure?

2631
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:57,460
I don't know.

2632
02:17:58,200 --> 02:17:58,740
Picross.

2633
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:01,760
Bloons?

2634
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:02,520
Bloons.

2635
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:03,700
I love Bloons.

2636
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:09,260
The collectors of this came with a fold-out map visitor...

2637
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:11,420
Guys.

2638
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:12,720
Hold on.

2639
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:14,460
Hold on.

2640
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:24,090
The treasure map!

2641
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:26,770
I must do first.

2642
02:18:27,330 --> 02:18:28,270
It says...

2643
02:18:28,270 --> 02:18:31,470
Upon a stormy cliff top, one should pause to see the view.

2644
02:18:32,110 --> 02:18:36,050
Peer through the earthy window, gold is hidden in the blue.

2645
02:18:37,710 --> 02:18:39,470
Sounds like a gold feather.

2646
02:18:40,470 --> 02:18:40,790
Okay.

2647
02:18:42,890 --> 02:18:45,470
And then I can get that achievement.

2648
02:18:47,630 --> 02:18:49,690
For ten gold feathers.

2649
02:18:49,810 --> 02:18:50,830
And then I'll feel satisfied.

2650
02:18:51,430 --> 02:18:51,810
I think.

2651
02:18:54,130 --> 02:18:56,670
I can see my house from here.

2652
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:12,040
Yes, Claire?

2653
02:19:16,590 --> 02:19:17,950
It's me!

2654
02:19:21,510 --> 02:19:24,190
Can you hear me up here?

2655
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:28,260
Sure can.

2656
02:19:31,140 --> 02:19:31,740
Okay.

2657
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:45,690
This game is so cute.

2658
02:19:49,450 --> 02:19:51,390
Is there something at the top of the...

2659
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:55,930
There is.

2660
02:19:57,030 --> 02:19:58,530
Wait, how do I get through here?

2661
02:19:59,710 --> 02:20:01,230
Maybe we have to climb...

2662
02:20:01,230 --> 02:20:03,230
Wait, but I don't have...

2663
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:03,630
Okay.

2664
02:20:05,210 --> 02:20:06,230
We'll have to...

2665
02:20:06,230 --> 02:20:07,890
We'll have to fly.

2666
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:20,800
I don't have a bucket.

2667
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:24,820
Meteor Lake Outlook.

2668
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:30,480
Oh, this is the Meteor Lake.

2669
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:36,980
We did go here.

2670
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:37,960
I just didn't realize.

2671
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:42,260
I see, I see.

2672
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:44,520
Okay, treasure, treasure, treasure, treasure.

2673
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:46,580
Oh, take the water.

2674
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,680
How do I get back up there?

2675
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:04,800
Can I get back up there?

2676
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:09,800
Bush circle looking sus.

2677
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:10,620
Where did you see that?

2678
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:11,360
Oh, this one.

2679
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:15,040
You're right.

2680
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:16,320
You're so right.

2681
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:17,940
I bet there's coins in here.

2682
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:22,980
I was right.

2683
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:28,800
Uh...

2684
02:21:34,210 --> 02:21:35,330
They're here?

2685
02:21:36,310 --> 02:21:37,570
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2686
02:21:38,390 --> 02:21:39,190
Yes, yes.

2687
02:21:40,050 --> 02:21:40,510
Yes.

2688
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:56,100
I got the achievement.

2689
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:03,600
We should still do the treasure map though, right?

2690
02:22:07,780 --> 02:22:08,940
That's awkward.

2691
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:14,880
It was like over here, right?

2692
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:18,400
No, this is where that guy is chilling.

2693
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:22,820
Kind of over here.

2694
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:25,400
So that just happened.

2695
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:30,760
Awkward turtle.

2696
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:39,540
Maybe I can fly from here.

2697
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:43,460
Or climb, I mean.

2698
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:04,350
This doesn't look very spooky at all.

2699
02:23:04,610 --> 02:23:05,630
Where's the spooky?

2700
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:18,440
Okay, let's fly from here.

2701
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:21,300
We're gliding.

2702
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:25,180
Oh, who's that?

2703
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:29,720
Oh, wait.

2704
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:32,920
Okay, hold on, hold on.

2705
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:34,360
So we're here, we're here, we're here.

2706
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,380
What was the hint?

2707
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:38,060
What was the hint?

2708
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:43,900
It says...

2709
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:47,420
Upon a stormy clifftop, one should pause to see the view.

2710
02:23:48,380 --> 02:23:51,060
Peer through the earthy window, gold is hidden in the blue.

2711
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:56,010
That window?

2712
02:24:00,450 --> 02:24:01,250
That one?

2713
02:24:02,210 --> 02:24:03,150
Earthy window.

2714
02:24:04,010 --> 02:24:04,950
Earthy window.

2715
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:14,390
This looks like an earthy window.

2716
02:24:18,140 --> 02:24:19,680
I don't think it's the ruins.

2717
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:22,480
But there was a treasure chest over there.

2718
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:28,880
Gold is hidden in the blue.

2719
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:31,080
On top of the arch?

2720
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:32,100
That?

2721
02:24:39,490 --> 02:24:39,890
Sorry.

2722
02:24:40,730 --> 02:24:41,270
Stop!

2723
02:24:41,810 --> 02:24:43,130
Stop, please!

2724
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,080
Oh, I found it.

2725
02:24:57,360 --> 02:24:59,560
I can't see anything.

2726
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:01,860
Is this the arch?

2727
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:05,240
I don't think so.

2728
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:06,400
Oh, the arch is over here.

2729
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:07,780
Arch is here.

2730
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:09,420
Okay.

2731
02:25:29,610 --> 02:25:30,910
Dig in the water?

2732
02:25:33,550 --> 02:25:34,190
Syntax!

2733
02:25:35,370 --> 02:25:35,970
It's your birthday.

2734
02:25:36,210 --> 02:25:37,770
I'm happy because you're here.

2735
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:40,470
In fact, it's my birthday.

2736
02:25:41,270 --> 02:25:42,710
As precious as...

2737
02:25:47,170 --> 02:25:48,450
Happy birthday...

2738
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:50,730
to you.

2739
02:25:50,730 --> 02:25:54,150
Happy birthday to you.

2740
02:25:54,610 --> 02:25:58,050
Happy birthday, dear syntax error.

2741
02:25:59,430 --> 02:26:03,130
Happy birthday to you.

2742
02:26:06,650 --> 02:26:07,950
Happy birthday.

2743
02:26:08,810 --> 02:26:10,390
Guys, I don't know.

2744
02:26:11,370 --> 02:26:13,530
I'm getting bested by this children's game.

2745
02:26:14,850 --> 02:26:18,430
I don't know.

2746
02:26:20,450 --> 02:26:21,530
Oh, that's right.

2747
02:26:21,610 --> 02:26:22,350
This is the bloom.

2748
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:27,950
Dig on the beach.

2749
02:26:34,480 --> 02:26:36,000
I think that's it.

2750
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:37,860
Possibly.

2751
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:41,460
I guess so.

2752
02:26:43,460 --> 02:26:44,280
Sid beach.

2753
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:48,000
I hid my treasure from the world, but never far from reach.

2754
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:51,220
You will find it in one piece.

2755
02:26:51,220 --> 02:26:56,560
It rests between the mossy stones that lie upon Sid beach.

2756
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:58,780
What is Sid beach?

2757
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:01,840
Try fishing.

2758
02:27:29,230 --> 02:27:29,670
With...

2759
02:27:55,890 --> 02:27:57,250
Big common carp.

2760
02:28:00,610 --> 02:28:03,090
I'm just gonna guess that this is the treasure.

2761
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:05,530
Because we dug it up, you know?

2762
02:28:06,090 --> 02:28:07,670
I'm gonna guess that that's the treasure.

2763
02:28:11,730 --> 02:28:13,210
Like I said, we got this one.

2764
02:28:13,630 --> 02:28:14,490
It's just out in the open.

2765
02:28:14,650 --> 02:28:15,990
What the heck is Sid beach?

2766
02:28:19,190 --> 02:28:20,230
Do we have a map?

2767
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:41,000
Like sometimes when I fall, Claire's face is just like...

2768
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:50,010
Maybe the real treasure was the friends we made along the way.

2769
02:28:50,530 --> 02:28:51,310
Must be.

2770
02:28:52,510 --> 02:28:54,190
Oh, this is the place where we can rent a boat.

2771
02:28:54,270 --> 02:28:54,950
Let's try it out.

2772
02:28:56,150 --> 02:28:57,190
Can I rent a boat?

2773
02:28:59,550 --> 02:29:00,510
Thank you.

2774
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:01,610
Here's the key.

2775
02:29:02,390 --> 02:29:07,190
Oh, and you read the provincial motorboating safety and operations guide, eh?

2776
02:29:09,430 --> 02:29:10,710
Yeah, great.

2777
02:29:11,190 --> 02:29:12,370
Have a good time out there.

2778
02:29:15,590 --> 02:29:16,870
I have.

2779
02:29:20,660 --> 02:29:22,980
Maybe we can find the beach with this.

2780
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:25,760
I didn't lie.

2781
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:28,200
I probably knew it.

2782
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:30,220
Oh my god!

2783
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:38,360
Sid beach, here we come!

2784
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:44,960
Sorry.

2785
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:55,540
We never found the watch and that bugs me so much.

2786
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:58,640
If I were a watch, where would I be?

2787
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:01,080
Is this Sid beach?

2788
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:03,300
This is mossy.

2789
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:06,400
Do you think this is Sid beach?

2790
02:30:10,650 --> 02:30:12,170
Anything behind the waterfall?

2791
02:30:12,490 --> 02:30:13,190
I don't know.

2792
02:30:26,460 --> 02:30:28,940
These look mossy stones, right?

2793
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:31,020
Can't tell.

2794
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:31,600
Hold on.

2795
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:33,740
I don't see Sid anywhere.

2796
02:30:34,440 --> 02:30:36,860
I don't know if that guy... that guy's probably dead.

2797
02:30:38,980 --> 02:30:39,880
Sid died.

2798
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:40,500
I killed him.

2799
02:30:42,700 --> 02:30:44,560
I need like a little... what's the word?

2800
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:55,130
Like a... one of... these, these, this, this.

2801
02:30:56,530 --> 02:30:58,050
Sid beach is this way!

2802
02:30:58,530 --> 02:30:59,730
Sid beach is this way.

2803
02:31:04,580 --> 02:31:06,500
I'll teach you to mess with me, Sid.

2804
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:11,400
This looks suspicious.

2805
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:12,860
Nevermind.

2806
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:19,680
What do you mean it's the wrong way?

2807
02:31:23,320 --> 02:31:24,440
It's this way.

2808
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:29,760
Who is this?

2809
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:30,760
What is this?

2810
02:31:34,570 --> 02:31:35,670
Who are you?

2811
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:39,830
What are you painting?

2812
02:31:40,430 --> 02:31:41,830
Oh, you can't tell.

2813
02:31:42,490 --> 02:31:44,450
It's supposed to be the coastline.

2814
02:31:45,910 --> 02:31:49,790
Though, I'm trying to go for a more abstract look.

2815
02:31:50,950 --> 02:31:52,550
I think I can see it now.

2816
02:31:53,090 --> 02:31:54,410
Still a work in progress.

2817
02:31:55,130 --> 02:31:56,690
I don't know if I like where it's going.

2818
02:31:57,190 --> 02:31:59,690
I think I'm gonna head over to the Blackwood Forest lighthouse soon.

2819
02:32:00,210 --> 02:32:02,510
I'm still trying to find the right inspiration.

2820
02:32:04,490 --> 02:32:06,450
I also think I see...

2821
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:08,670
a...

2822
02:32:11,090 --> 02:32:11,850
Oh damn.

2823
02:32:12,070 --> 02:32:13,630
No, I thought I saw a...

2824
02:32:13,630 --> 02:32:14,110
What's it called?

2825
02:32:16,070 --> 02:32:17,450
A little digging spot.

2826
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:20,730
Chest top left?

2827
02:32:20,870 --> 02:32:21,810
Yeah, the one I just got, right?

2828
02:32:25,270 --> 02:32:27,010
Is this Sid beach?

2829
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:33,160
Wait, mossy blocks.

2830
02:32:34,220 --> 02:32:35,320
I think it's here.

2831
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:37,920
I think it's here, I think it's here.

2832
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:39,240
Here, here, here.

2833
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:42,020
No.

2834
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:45,500
This is mossy rocks, right?

2835
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:49,860
Nice drift, thank you.

2836
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:51,280
I'm a professional.

2837
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:56,040
I don't know.

2838
02:32:59,100 --> 02:33:00,220
It's just some bushes.

2839
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:01,660
No.

2840
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:06,020
Those rocks are swaying...

2841
02:33:07,380 --> 02:33:09,880
They could be soft.

2842
02:33:09,880 --> 02:33:13,600
From the water.

2843
02:33:14,480 --> 02:33:15,340
And the cold.

2844
02:33:19,170 --> 02:33:20,890
Mossy rocks.

2845
02:33:22,210 --> 02:33:23,930
That's a mossy rock.

2846
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:37,280
I don't know, I give up.

2847
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:40,420
I don't know, I need a walkthrough.

2848
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:41,740
Game facts.

2849
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:46,180
I need a gamer facts right now.

2850
02:33:55,340 --> 02:33:57,500
Maybe further down, you think so?

2851
02:34:04,210 --> 02:34:05,170
Let's see.

2852
02:34:08,610 --> 02:34:09,510
What's that?

2853
02:34:13,260 --> 02:34:15,840
I think that says to the main island.

2854
02:34:17,740 --> 02:34:18,900
What's this area?

2855
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:23,060
I'm okay.

2856
02:34:23,900 --> 02:34:25,280
Oh, I'm causing erosion?

2857
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:26,580
Oh my god.

2858
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:28,500
Oh shit.

2859
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:38,380
It's like those people that go to the beach and like, dig.

2860
02:34:39,140 --> 02:34:44,920
Like, they connect the rivers to the beach and like, just mess up the ecosystem entirely.

2861
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:48,900
So my sources say you've delivered the goods.

2862
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:50,580
Your sources are correct.

2863
02:34:51,640 --> 02:34:52,500
So what about that pay?

2864
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:53,960
Okay, okay, here you go.

2865
02:34:55,540 --> 02:34:56,440
Enjoy your shell.

2866
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:58,980
Wait, did he give me the shells back?

2867
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:04,710
This punk ass kid.

2868
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:13,900
At least we can get around so fast now.

2869
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:16,560
I think Sid Beach is a myth.

2870
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:19,320
I don't think it exists.

2871
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:22,220
Auntie, don't look!

2872
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:24,100
Don't look, Auntie!

2873
02:35:32,230 --> 02:35:33,290
It's a myth!

2874
02:35:34,050 --> 02:35:34,910
It's a lie!

2875
02:35:34,910 --> 02:35:36,930
The beach is a lie!

2876
02:35:41,950 --> 02:35:44,870
I think I'm steering pretty well, I'm not gonna lie.

2877
02:35:46,830 --> 02:35:48,370
Like, these are bushes.

2878
02:35:49,710 --> 02:35:51,050
Those aren't rocks.

2879
02:35:55,390 --> 02:35:56,950
The music is so loud.

2880
02:36:00,130 --> 02:36:02,710
I think that was a mossy beach.

2881
02:36:03,490 --> 02:36:05,110
It said mossy rocks though, right?

2882
02:36:05,490 --> 02:36:06,210
Or am I crazy?

2883
02:36:14,770 --> 02:36:16,030
Mossy stones.

2884
02:36:17,250 --> 02:36:18,510
Mossy stones.

2885
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:21,190
I haven't seen a single mossy stone!

2886
02:36:31,290 --> 02:36:33,910
Oh, that looks suspicious right there though.

2887
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:38,850
Hold on, first let's do this.

2888
02:36:40,310 --> 02:36:41,970
Oh, no, uh...

2889
02:36:41,970 --> 02:36:42,430
This?

2890
02:36:42,810 --> 02:36:44,050
No, uh...

2891
02:36:44,050 --> 02:36:44,570
This?

2892
02:36:46,330 --> 02:36:47,050
Nevermind.

2893
02:36:48,270 --> 02:36:48,990
Suspicious?

2894
02:36:54,170 --> 02:36:55,490
More coin.

2895
02:36:56,590 --> 02:36:57,430
Did you want a hint?

2896
02:36:57,550 --> 02:36:58,310
Yes, please!

2897
02:36:58,990 --> 02:37:00,670
Yes, hint please.

2898
02:37:02,250 --> 02:37:03,450
Please help.

2899
02:37:05,070 --> 02:37:06,130
Help, please.

2900
02:37:07,910 --> 02:37:09,430
Help, onegaishimasu.

2901
02:37:10,790 --> 02:37:11,970
Help, please.

2902
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:13,350
No hint.

2903
02:37:13,550 --> 02:37:14,350
Yes, hint!

2904
02:37:15,150 --> 02:37:16,690
Are you saying I have no intelligence?

2905
02:37:18,430 --> 02:37:20,470
This is secretly a horror game.

2906
02:37:27,810 --> 02:37:29,590
I can get this one too.

2907
02:37:31,530 --> 02:37:32,610
Mint intelligence.

2908
02:37:34,510 --> 02:37:36,250
I keep doing that on accident.

2909
02:37:38,870 --> 02:37:40,590
I don't need your stinking money.

2910
02:37:40,710 --> 02:37:43,170
I'm trying to find a dang...

2911
02:37:44,430 --> 02:37:45,030
Watch.

2912
02:37:47,170 --> 02:37:49,370
Go back to the climbing wall is the hint.

2913
02:37:59,790 --> 02:38:00,810
Mossy rocks!

2914
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:12,040
Yippee!

2915
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:18,780
Yippee!

2916
02:38:21,940 --> 02:38:25,340
I think we solved both treasure maps then.

2917
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:31,760
And, uh...

2918
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:32,960
I think I already found this one.

2919
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:33,540
Okay, nice.

2920
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:34,380
So it does tell you.

2921
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:35,260
So we did it.

2922
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:36,180
So that was it.

2923
02:38:36,300 --> 02:38:36,840
Good, good, good.

2924
02:38:42,950 --> 02:38:43,630
Uh...

2925
02:38:46,340 --> 02:38:48,560
More maps somewhere, I think.

2926
02:38:48,660 --> 02:38:49,000
Probably.

2927
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:57,620
But we got our...

2928
02:38:59,580 --> 02:39:02,940
We got our ten...

2929
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:05,380
Ten feathers.

2930
02:39:06,700 --> 02:39:08,080
Did you check the other map?

2931
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:09,320
Oh, I can check it.

2932
02:39:11,240 --> 02:39:12,760
Pretty sure this is it though.

2933
02:39:12,780 --> 02:39:14,600
I'm on like 99% positive.

2934
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:16,620
Yep.

2935
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:18,860
Pirate!

2936
02:39:19,880 --> 02:39:20,440
Five.

2937
02:39:21,380 --> 02:39:23,780
Can you say a seashore seller sells seashells?

2938
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:24,160
Yep.

2939
02:39:26,500 --> 02:39:28,260
That one doesn't trick me up.

2940
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:30,480
Sally sells seashells by the seashore?

2941
02:39:30,660 --> 02:39:32,400
That one doesn't trick me up very much.

2942
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:50,750
Sally sells seashells by the seashore.

2943
02:39:53,170 --> 02:39:55,170
It's all about those...

2944
02:39:58,110 --> 02:39:58,590
I...

2945
02:39:59,470 --> 02:40:01,490
Oh, someone said about behind the waterfall.

2946
02:40:01,630 --> 02:40:03,790
Let's go check that and then I'll close out.

2947
02:40:05,570 --> 02:40:06,050
Irish...

2948
02:40:07,810 --> 02:40:08,290
Wristwatch.

2949
02:40:11,230 --> 02:40:12,190
Irish wristwatch.

2950
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:15,110
I don't think there is anything behind here.

2951
02:40:18,710 --> 02:40:20,830
I'm climbing the water fountain.

2952
02:40:21,550 --> 02:40:22,690
I mean waterfall.

2953
02:40:22,990 --> 02:40:24,070
It's not a water fountain.

2954
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:26,050
I mean this could be a water fountain.

2955
02:40:26,150 --> 02:40:26,990
A really big one.

2956
02:40:30,390 --> 02:40:31,510
Another stick.

2957
02:40:31,730 --> 02:40:33,850
We never found out what we need the stick for.

2958
02:40:34,870 --> 02:40:35,970
It is a mystery.

2959
02:40:36,630 --> 02:40:37,850
Left unsolved.

2960
02:40:41,190 --> 02:40:42,270
Unsolved mystery.

2961
02:40:42,270 --> 02:40:42,410
Mystery.

2962
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:47,250
We could probably climb the mountain again.

2963
02:40:51,950 --> 02:40:53,230
Irish wrist...

2964
02:40:53,230 --> 02:40:54,350
Oh, wishy-washy.

2965
02:40:55,130 --> 02:40:55,470
Yeah.

2966
02:41:00,450 --> 02:41:01,610
Oh, that dog.

2967
02:41:03,430 --> 02:41:04,590
I'm gonna climb the mountain.

2968
02:41:04,710 --> 02:41:05,390
Oh, wrong way.

2969
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:11,380
I'm a new bird.

2970
02:41:11,540 --> 02:41:12,080
I've climbed.

2971
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:14,500
I've climbed and I will climb again.

2972
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:18,840
Oh, there is a treasure chest down there.

2973
02:41:24,500 --> 02:41:24,980
Watch!

2974
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:25,420
No!

2975
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:28,920
How the hell am I supposed to find this watch?

2976
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:31,440
I think...

2977
02:41:32,720 --> 02:41:34,000
It's fake too.

2978
02:41:35,780 --> 02:41:37,440
I think the sticks are related to the boat.

2979
02:41:39,700 --> 02:41:40,180
Perhaps.

2980
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:44,680
Perhaps.

2981
02:41:45,560 --> 02:41:46,040
Perchance.

2982
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:49,660
What is over... Did I go over here?

2983
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:50,760
Before?

2984
02:41:56,230 --> 02:41:57,070
Maybe not.

2985
02:41:58,410 --> 02:42:01,010
Sorry, I like just kind of exploring in this game.

2986
02:42:01,650 --> 02:42:05,150
Even though I've basically gotten everything, but it's still kind of fun.

2987
02:42:10,100 --> 02:42:11,460
Well, not everything, you know.

2988
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:13,800
Rubber flower.

2989
02:42:14,140 --> 02:42:16,140
Oh, so you can get it here too.

2990
02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:16,260
Cool.

2991
02:42:19,380 --> 02:42:20,980
You can get the flower here too.

2992
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:22,580
Oh, now we have two buckets.

2993
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:23,400
Okay, let's go.

2994
02:42:31,060 --> 02:42:31,500
Okay.

2995
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:33,200
What if I climb this?

2996
02:42:35,820 --> 02:42:37,180
You think we'll make it?

2997
02:42:38,960 --> 02:42:40,520
I don't think we're gonna make it.

2998
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:42,520
So close.

2999
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:49,740
Oi, oi, oi.

3000
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:52,680
Am I frozen?

3001
02:42:55,300 --> 02:42:56,600
Will we make it?

3002
02:42:58,320 --> 02:42:59,000
Nope.

3003
02:43:00,020 --> 02:43:00,360
Sad.

3004
02:43:00,580 --> 02:43:01,340
Sad times.

3005
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:04,280
Sad times for our little bird friend.

3006
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:06,600
Okay, alright, alright.

3007
02:43:07,160 --> 02:43:09,000
One more climb, everybody.

3008
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:10,840
One more climb.

3009
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:13,100
The final climb.

3010
02:43:21,260 --> 02:43:22,720
Oh, they're here.

3011
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:25,440
Hey you guys, how's it going?

3012
02:43:26,060 --> 02:43:28,380
Oh, you know, pretty good.

3013
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:30,820
I just conquered Hawk Peak.

3014
02:43:31,460 --> 02:43:33,120
Like, no big deal.

3015
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:34,300
Nice.

3016
02:43:34,900 --> 02:43:35,940
You made it to the top too?

3017
02:43:37,660 --> 02:43:39,740
Wow, almost conquered it.

3018
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:41,820
We're basically there, right?

3019
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:45,980
Well, technically, this whole area is considered Hawk Peak.

3020
02:43:49,060 --> 02:43:49,460
See?

3021
02:43:49,460 --> 02:43:50,180
Nailed it!

3022
02:43:51,260 --> 02:43:53,580
We're gonna make it to Hawk Peak's peak another day.

3023
02:43:54,360 --> 02:43:55,300
I think we're at our limit.

3024
02:43:56,020 --> 02:43:57,620
It's better not to push yourself too hard, right?

3025
02:43:59,060 --> 02:43:59,460
Definitely.

3026
02:43:59,460 --> 02:44:00,860
Safety always comes first.

3027
02:44:02,080 --> 02:44:02,840
You made it up though.

3028
02:44:03,580 --> 02:44:04,140
How was it?

3029
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:06,020
It was beautiful.

3030
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:09,060
The northern lights are really bright up there.

3031
02:44:09,940 --> 02:44:11,100
I can't wait to see it myself.

3032
02:44:12,200 --> 02:44:12,760
Aww.

3033
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,820
Yeah, give up, dummy.

3034
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:20,540
Suspicious rock formation.

3035
02:44:23,080 --> 02:44:24,840
The music here is so dramatic.

3036
02:44:25,060 --> 02:44:25,780
It makes me nervous.

3037
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:28,280
Wait, I've done the suspicious rock formation.

3038
02:44:29,140 --> 02:44:29,760
Yes, I have.

3039
02:44:36,820 --> 02:44:39,040
Is this where we did it before?

3040
02:44:39,320 --> 02:44:39,860
Pretty sure.

3041
02:44:41,400 --> 02:44:43,240
Yeah, this is the strat.

3042
02:44:44,340 --> 02:44:46,540
Look into a room.

3043
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:56,920
It only relieves nasal congestion for a few hours, but it's really effective.

3044
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:57,700
I see.

3045
02:44:58,900 --> 02:44:59,760
Thank you.

3046
02:45:00,200 --> 02:45:03,240
I think I need actual med meds though.

3047
02:45:04,180 --> 02:45:05,620
I appreciate it.

3048
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:12,600
I've been taking medicine, but I think I need an antibiotic or something.

3049
02:45:14,820 --> 02:45:16,880
God, this is so easy.

3050
02:45:21,420 --> 02:45:23,780
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

3051
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:27,400
That's not what I wanted to do.

3052
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:30,460
I want to climb.

3053
02:45:30,820 --> 02:45:31,240
There we go.

3054
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:34,980
Yeah!

3055
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:53,630
The air in the mountain of the Hawk Peak is quite refreshing.

3056
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:04,520
That's a neat bird.

3057
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:08,400
Did you know that my name in Welsh means little raven and crow?

3058
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:11,920
Your parents like birds?

3059
02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:15,440
Nice Tia impression.

3060
02:46:15,940 --> 02:46:16,420
Merci.

3061
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:17,780
Merci beaucoup.

3062
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:21,500
Thanks for the stream, Mintow.

3063
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:22,560
Thank you guys!

3064
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:24,660
This is such a cute little game.

3065
02:46:24,740 --> 02:46:26,320
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

3066
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:28,480
Just a sweet little short hike.

3067
02:46:29,140 --> 02:46:30,840
I know it's a little stressful sometimes.

3068
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:34,000
Uh...

3069
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:36,160
Oh, Tia is here.

3070
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:38,480
Gotta go!

3071
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:39,820
Thank

3072
02:46:44,170 --> 02:46:45,810
you guys for the stream.

3073
02:46:46,110 --> 02:46:46,670
Otsumito!

3074
02:46:47,430 --> 02:46:47,990
Otsumito!

3075
02:46:48,470 --> 02:46:51,170
And I'll see you guys later!

3076
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:55,590
If you are at any party tonight, I'll see you there.

3077
02:46:55,770 --> 02:46:58,230
If not, then I'll see you next stream.

3078
02:46:58,990 --> 02:46:59,670
Or next event.

3079
02:46:59,910 --> 02:47:00,670
Or next whatever.

3080
02:47:00,670 --> 02:47:02,410
Bye-bye!

3081
02:47:05,110 --> 02:47:06,310
Otsumito!

3082
02:47:06,650 --> 02:47:07,090
Bye-bye!
