He came here.

45
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,920
Did you steal a kiss?

46
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:02,960
Yes.

47
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,580
Yeah, I'm pursuing...

48
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,120

49
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,300
Rabbit night.

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,080
Blonde blazer.

55
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,660
Yeah, I'm in pursuit.

56
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm in active pursuit.

57
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,500
Invisigal.

58
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,460
No, no, no, not her, not her.

59
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,620
She's fine.

60
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,680
Invisigal is the criminal.

61
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,640
It's a criminal that she stole my heart.

62
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,860
You know?

63
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,040
Wait, you're confusing me now.

64
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,660
Wait, why am I confusing you?

65
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,280
I am pursuing blonde blazer.

66
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,100
I called her a criminal because she stole my heart.

67
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:22,880
But I'm not going after the actual criminal who is Invisigal

68
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:45,620
Joker voice It's simple, we fire the Batman That's exactly
what I did Okay though I fired him because For my staff Oh,

69
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,340
dang.

70
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,040
I really should have not taught him how to fly.

71
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,160
But for my stats, what was her name?

72
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,220
Coupe?

73
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,700
Coupe.

74
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,320
Coupe was better.

75
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,520
For me.

76
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,940
So I just had to...

77
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,020
What if I want like a whole team of baddies?

78
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,060
And they're all like super hot women on my baddie team.

79
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,620
I almost don't want to watch.

80
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,260
Like, you know what?

81
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,220
You can...

82
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,920
Maybe...

83
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,720
You don't always have to say everything that comes to your
mind, you know?

84
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,480
If you don't want to watch, you don't have to.

85
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,200
That's A-OK.

86
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,520
Gollum is baddie.

87
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,340
Yes, yes.

88
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,240
A whole team of beautiful ladies and gollum.

89
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,860
When do I get to kiss that guy?

90
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,960
I hope so.

91
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,980
In the extras, you can see your past choices.

92
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:50,640
Oh!

93
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,700
Choice stats.

94
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,340
Oh, yeah, I did that.

95
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,340
Yeah, I definitely kissed her.

96
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,920
Why is it so slow?

97
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,780
It kind of makes me...

98
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:04,980
Woo!

99
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,740

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,500
Oh, yeah, I let that guy drop.

104
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,520
He was not upset.

105
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,800
He was not... He was upset with me.

106
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:30,300
Your success rate in the fight with talks was 88 percent

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,540
Video game.

113
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,500
It's a sign of peace.

114
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,480
Royd is special.

115
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,200
He's a bro.

116
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,480
It's fiction.

117
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,940
I thought art imitated life.

118
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,480
But clearly not.

119
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:37,580
Oh.

120
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,940
Okay.

121
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,600
I understand now.

122
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,560
We do.

123
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,180
We do a good job at that.

124
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,860
Separating.

125
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,520
real life from fiction, from fantasy.

126
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,400
This is a game of superheroes, everybody.

127
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,760
It's fantasy.

128
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,200
It really, really depends on who asks for the bump.

129
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,240
Oh, really?

130
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,700
Riz, thank you for the super child.

131
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,540
Okay, um, the rock.

132
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,100
If he asks for you to fist bump him, would you?

133
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,120
The rock?

134
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,640
No.

135
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,800
A lot of Okay, what about Dwayne?

136
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,370
No.

137
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,150
What about Johnson?

138
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,390
What about Dwayne Johnson?

139
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,430
What about the?

140
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,790
In the real world, the urinal rule prevents this from
happening.

141
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,470
The urinal rule?

142
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,370
It's rule number one of speaking in the men's bathroom.

143
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,330
Speaking in the men's bathroom.

144
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,430
What about Rock the Dwayne Johnson?

145
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,170
Um, who else?

146
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,770
Big fan of Johnson.

147
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,750
Um, what if...

148
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,650
Okay, I was going to say Pliskin, but that would be like an
obvious choice.

149
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,750
Everybody would say yes.

150
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,830
What?

151
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,650
I have to think of real life people.

152
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,870
What if Ryan...

153
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,550
Ryan...

154
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,250
Geisling.

155
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,710
He's the liked one.

156
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,780
Extra civility.

157
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
What do you mean though today?

158
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:38,880
Yes?

159
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,060
I'm seeing some no's.

160
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,460
Just Ryan.

161
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,940
Kiana Reeves!

162
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,200
What if Kiana Reeves asks you to fist bump him at the
urinal?

163
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,950
I think that's a resounding yes.

164
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,250
I think everybody would say yes.

165
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,030
I would say yes.

166
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,170
What am I doing at the urinal?

167
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:08,930
Maybe.

168
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,690
I've walked...

169
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,530
I've forgotten my glasses.

170
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,670
I walked into the wrong bathroom.

171
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,550
Fury of a thousand sons to those who interact there.

172
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,590
I just woke up from a nap.

173
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:22,990
Hi, Minto.

174
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,090
Good morning.

175
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,690
Good morning, Minto.

176
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,700
Minto.

177
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:31,860
Okay.

178
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,100
I think I'm understanding.

179
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,620
I'd hold it for Kiano.

180
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,720
What does that mean?

181
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,700
Like you would not go to the bathroom?

182
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,260
It's not good for you.

183
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,540
If you have to pee, you have to pee.

184
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,080
You don't take the urinal next door.

185
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,020
You always maximize available urinal space to maintain said
rule.

186
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,480
Our boy Robbie made a technical foul first.

187
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,500
Holding it.

188
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,040
Yeah.

189
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,380
Like, I'm holding it.

190
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,180
I gotta pee.

191
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,320
I gotta pee.

192
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:12,800
I can't.

193
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,120
hold it any longer.

194
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,400
It.

195
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:19,980
The clown?

196
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,700
What was that guy's...

197
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,000
Would you...

198
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,260
Are we fist-pumping?

199
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:28,520
It?

200
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,020
The clown...

201
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,900
What's that guy's name?

202
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,540
What?

203
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,860
What is his actor's name?

204
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,240
Hmm.

205
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,700
It.

206
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,840
The clown.

207
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,500
Actor.

208
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,600
Pennywise?

209
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,040
No.

210
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,740
But, uh, Bill Scarsguard.

211
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,400
That's the new guy.

212
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,620
That's the one I was thinking of, not Tim Curry.

213
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,160
Real friends help each other aim.

214
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,420
No, oh.

215
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,780
No, wait.

216
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,000
Isn't it like a battleship?

217
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,480
Wait, Ratatouille.

218
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,680
Where you are like holding, you are controlling their hands
with their hair.

219
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,940
Need to pee?

220
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,120
Go piss, girl.

221
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,980
I want to watch Gossip Girl now.

222
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,460
XO, XO.

223
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,780
Go piss girl.

224
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,390
What else did we do?

225
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,320
Oh, yeah.

226
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:44,240
See, I let Sonar meet his hero, and it went great, and then
I fired him.

227
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,500
So honestly, I think he was really okay, because I let him
meet his hero.

228
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,520
You...

229
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,460
Oh, your most sent hero was Sonar.

230
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,060
Maybe I should have kept that guy.

231
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,320
His calls were a yellow super chat.

232
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,760
Wait, maybe I should have kept him.

233
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,080
But this was...

234
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,460
This was episode 2.

235
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,480
This was in episode 3.

236
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,820
In episode 3, he kept getting caught by...

237
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,620
By, like, the sexy traps.

238
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,880
The men's room is, like, that gas...

239
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,600
scene from

240
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,590
the movie.

241
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,410
Even if she's a bully and a hater.

242
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,990
Who am I hating?

243
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,810
Who am I bullying?

244
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,190
What do you mean?

245
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,330
Tom didn't bully.

246
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,200
You and 37.

247
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
Look, you guys are getting a new experience, okay?

248
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:06,140
What am I supposed to be like the rest of the 70% of the
world, the closer to 60% of the world, that kept him on the

249
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,820
team, you're getting a different experience from the Mint
Phantom channel.

250
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,560
63.

251
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,660
Shut up.

252
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,500
I rounded up.

253
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,800
I rounded up.

254
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,560
Am I supposed to be like everybody else?

255
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm my own ghost.

256
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,400
That's why I'm dead and you're alive.

257
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,880
Because I don't follow the status quo.

258
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,500
You with...

259
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,400
Oh no, this one I do regret though.

260
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,920
But he needed to learn a lesson.

261
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,820
But look at this.

262
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,880
I feel really bad about this one.

263
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,760
I don't feel bad about this one.

264
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,360
I feel bad about this one.

265
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,820
We're gonna be good to Gollum this time.

266
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,120
He's gonna be our bestest buddy.

267
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:15,820
How time flies Weep King Thank you Oh hi Minto Off to work
today Good luck There's so many dispatch streamers But there

268
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:26,280
is only one Minto Look You probably would have never seen
This sad Sad little cute face If I hadn't done that I'm

269
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,500
giving you a new experience She's not like other girls She's
worse.

270
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,920
I can't help it.

271
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,780
I can't help being dumber than the rest.

272
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,140
Two things to keep in mind on percentages.

273
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,520
Since some choices are three or more, your choice can seem
like a minority when it's actually a plurality.

274
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,100
The game counts replays for percentages.

275
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,590
It counts replays.

276
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,150
Then that would skew everything.

277
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,710
ViviCore, thanks so much for the five gift days.

278
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,650
Wait, so the numbers don't even matter?

279
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,290
Oh, huh.

280
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,580
Ever seen the video of the guys in the urinal helping each
other while smoking and drinking?

281
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,560
I don't think I have said that before.

282
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,720
I don't think so.

283
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,560
Who has more kissable lips?

284
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,800
Sonar or Gollum?

285
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,080
I mean, Gollum has a lot to spare, baby.

286
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,060
Look at that.

287
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,180
Also, It's all natural.

288
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,660
You and 99% of players help them visit Gal.

289
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,460
We said 64% said we're all Phoenixes.

290
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,100
32% said F them stars.

291
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,880
Fizdom!

292
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,220
Thank you so much for the fight.

293
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,500
Get the D-Killers!

294
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,800
Out of the five times a hero was sabotaged, you helped them
escape with no injuries.

295
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,200
Four times.

296
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Look at that win rate.

297
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,360
Let's go.

298
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,960
F them stars.

299
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,920
9% of...

300
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,900
Look, I did the whole thing with Punch-Up and Coupé and the
Fighting Club.

301
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,280
We had to keep her.

302
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,920
The UN88% of players successfully protected Victor and
Vazlav.

303
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,900
Is that guy going to come back?

304
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,400
And look, my most sent hero was Malevola.

305
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,320
We didn't even need Batman.

306
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,660
We didn't need that guy.

307
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,120
On to episode 4?

308
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,720
Let's go, baby.

309
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,640
Okay.

310
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:52,620
the parts that matter what is that silent hill btm this hold
on though that sounds like silent hill doesn't it all colors

311
00:22:52,620 --> 00:23:01,440
thank you so much for the five gifting Bjorn thank you so
much for the five gifting thank you he prepared a mule wait

312
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:10,360
what are we doing well actually I just realized my sound was
really high up oh my goodness it saved me when Thank you for

313
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,660
the gift.

314
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,400
Am I allowed to be down bad for Malevolo?

315
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
Yeah, I think so.

316
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,300
Every choice Minto made is correct because cute.

317
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,760
Episode four.

318
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,640
Resume.

319
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,980
I don't want my ears blasting.

320
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,000
Am I gonna go deaf?

321
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,500
Oh!

322
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:00,760
Oh!

323
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,700
Uncensor, I need to uncensor right now!

324
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,220
I need to get into the settings!

325
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,730
Is it Invisible?

326
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:15,930
Wait.

327
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,380
Who is that?

328
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,400
Huh?

329
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,100
Huh?

330
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,970
She...

331
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,570
She thinking about...

332
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,730
I don't think that would be my reaction waking up.

333
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,950
I think...

334
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Wait, has she?

335
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,960
Wait, do we need to change course?

336
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,240
No.

337
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,620
No, stick with the...

338
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,580
Eye on the prize.

339
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,860
Robert, thank you so much for the five gifts.

340
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,500
She doesn't...

341
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,640
Kitty!

342
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,960
She doesn't regret it.

343
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,520
Breaking up with...

344
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,720
She doesn't regret it.

345
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:39,680
Ah!

346
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,560
Oh my god.

347
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,760
That's terrible.

348
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,300
Please remember your password.

349
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,300
I'm turning it down.

350
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,160
I think she enjoyed that dream.

351
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,780
Ghost of commitment.

352
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,500
When I love a girl, that's all I could see.

353
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,380
She was tied with sonar.

354
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,720
Never understood why.

355
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,000
But then again, I don't know a whole lot about demonic shit.

356
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
That's a thing, right?

357
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,400
Oh, that was his screech!

358
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,900
Best to keep an eye on her.

359
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,080
My bad.

360
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,020
The only cutting one of them is now you gotta deal with
their pissy friends poisoning the rest of the team.

361
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,220
Harmless.

362
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,380
It's harmless.

363
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,240
Oh, well, thank you so much for the fifth to get to take
here!

364
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,520
Don't even think about it.

365
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,740
That's why I would have cut them all.

366
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,380
Yeah.

367
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,620
Cut them out.

368
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,800
Cut them all.

369
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,840
Why is she staring at you?

370
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,640
Don't you got some work?

371
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,460
She's...

372
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,080
Don't you got some dementia to onset?

373
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,260
She's so too dirty.

374
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,080
Hey, uh, Blazers looking at backfilling your open spot with
Phenoma Man or Waterboy.

375
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,000
You should think about who you want.

376
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,100
poster boy of SDN and the other guy pukes water.

377
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,060
What am I missing?

378
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,740
No, I love Water Boy!

379
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,420
Oh no, he's sad because he got broken up!

380
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,780
Oh no!

381
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,180
Rick, he looks rough.

382
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,240
We're gonna go with Water Boy, though.

383
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,660
I learned that Water Boy is voiced by a YouTuber I like.

384
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,420
Hey, I was watching that.

385
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,560
Oh, sorry.

386
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,660
Looks like there's no wrong answer.

387
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,580
Joel Haver, yeah, yeah.

388
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,060
I like his skits.

389
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,460
I didn't hear it at first.

390
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,000
That's a Chihuahua.

391
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,080
What is this?

392
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,780
Someone's printing their Dojin shit at work?

393
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,520
Hello?

394
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,820
I don't want to go with Famama, ma'am.

395
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,800
I don't like that guy.

396
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,320

Okay.

414
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,680
Do you ever jerk off in this thing?

415
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,120
You low-low, Vizzy.

416
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,720
All the time.

417
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,740
I should really be asking how often.

418
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,780
Hey, come on.

419
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,800
I gotta work on this.

420
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,420
All the time, actually.

421
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,020
Bro.

422
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:03,240
I like to bus after every big bus, you know, and I was
pretty successful, so you can imagine.

423
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,080
Sounds like loads of fun.

424
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,160
Oh, they're flirting now.

425
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,020
Oh, no.

426
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,100
Oh.

427
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,800
You two got one weird energy going on.

428
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,660
She doesn't even know that she had that sexy dream about
him.

429
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,020
Can you handle this deep revelation some other place?

430
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,780
I got work, yeah?

431
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,520
Robert was just leaving.

432
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,140
Weeks of fun, weeks of fun.

433
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,780
That's going to be tough.

434
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,980
Because Blazer sent me to get you like half an hour ago,
so...

435
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,560
Stay invisible while doing the checkout.

436
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,840
Sorry if I missed...

437
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,680
Sorry, Bin, that I didn't get to see what your super chat
said, because it went fast.

453
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,700
tell him to stop with the edible arrangements he keeps
sending them but with All melon.

454
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,760
That's disgusting.

455
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,120
I'll see what I can do.

456
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:45,720
Oh my god.

457
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,800
My man never played a facade.

458
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,570
Hey, you're a phenomenon man.

459
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,290
How you doing, bud?

460
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,810
I have been better, Robert Robertson.

461
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,050
The blonde blazer and I have ended our relationship.

462
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,410
Yeah, I heard about that.

463
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,050
I'm sorry for your...

464
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,230
Honestly, though, I've never received that edible
arrangement.

465
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,910
I've always wanted one, though, because I just love fruit.

466
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,130
I should order myself one.

467
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,430
What's the occasion?

468
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:21,710
Hunger.

469
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:27,610
I'm holding all its energy and casting this planet into
infinite darkness so that I never have to see her or anyone

470
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,850
else ever again.

471
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,070
Maybe then I will be free of the torment in my soul.

472
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:38,750
And maybe then I could quiet my mind to these destructive
thoughts.

473
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,030
Please don't.

474
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,290
Bro, listen to MCR once.

475
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,510
We like it how it is.

476
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:43,990
Yeah.

477
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,410
Do you?

478
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:50,110
These days I find its ability to rise each morning
irritatingly optimistic.

479
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:53,570
Oh my!

480
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,770
Do you think there is someone else?

481
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,070
Perhaps another lover could be the cause of all this.

482
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,990
Maybe she met a person.

483
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,670
An actual person.

484
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,410
She didn't like me like that though.

485
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,230
I just resemble one anatomically.

486
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,730
Tell him?

487
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,310
No.

488
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,770
I don't think there is, but even if there was, wouldn't that
just make you feel worse?

489
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,610
He's gonna kill me.

490
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,190
I prefer when problems have solutions.

491
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:17,210
You guys, we didn't know that she was dating someone.

492
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,270
Man, her feelings aren't a problem for you to solve.

493
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,650
Blazer makes her own decisions because that's what people
do.

494
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:29,510
She's her own person, and she decided she doesn't want to be
with you.

495
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,710
That's the fact that I'm not a person is contributing to my
confusion.

496
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,430
Yeah, listen, you know what, while we're at it, no more
edible arrangements.

497
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,230
You guys are being a little dramatic, okay?

498
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,130
It's okay.

499
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,710
It seems I have much to learn about people.

500
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,890
You guys are being a little...

501
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,290
Okay, I missed a thing.

502
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,430
It's all right.

503
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,970
I'm playing the game for myself.

504
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,190
I'm going to pause because I don't want to miss the whole
conversation.

505
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,310
I don't know why the backseating is so crazy.

506
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:08,750
It's so sorry that I did not make the correct choice, but
I'm sorry.

507
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,290
I'm playing.

508
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,730
I'm just making my own choices.

509
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:25,230
so yeah let's let's calm down a little bit okay okay well
actually no not any time just just sometimes occasionally

510
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:33,590
barely any it seems the velocity with which I sat up has
shot shards of glass into your chest oh dang we're bleeding

511
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:46,410
for real shit I think it's pretty boring if somebody plays
the game the same way as everybody else does so you know I

512
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:52,990
think if you want to watch someone play the same route over
and over again you could go watch another person that

513
00:35:52,990 --> 00:36:02,950
already played that job would have me bleeding this often
what are you doing here I had a dream last night that we

514
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:11,430
were fucking oh wow she told him usually I don't remember my
dreams but this one was pretty vivid how how I didn't

515
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,950
finish.

516
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,090
Not what I asked.

517
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,050
I don't know.

518
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,870
That's not what I saw.

519
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,770
So this is why you've been acting so weird all day.

520
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,110
I'm doing that thing where I imagine being with someone, you
know?

521
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,990
See how it feels, how it looks, you know, like trying on a
dress.

522
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,950
You were there.

523
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,030
I could have been.

524
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,890
Oh, my God.

525
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,790
Of course she was.

526
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,990
I could be anywhere.

527
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,070
Oh.

528
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,490
Oh.

529
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:40,590
Oh.

530
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,910
No, you chose to be here.

531
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,070
Oh, sorry.

532
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,950
I tried not to...

533
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,150
I tried not to do that.

534
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,530
Don't worry about it, Waterboy.

535
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:55,490
Bathrooms are for shitting after your first coffee and
taking shrapnel out of your chest.

536
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,890
Not for whatever this is.

537
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,610
She's flirting with us.

538
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,790
You ruined this for me.

539
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,210
It's... I know.

540
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,150
I know.

541
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,450
No, Waterboy.

542
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,350
Where's my Waterboy route?

543
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,590

544
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:25,210

550
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,380
Flambé can handle this.

All right, so thank you so much for the thank you.

552
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,080
Thank you.

553
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,600
Which one?

554
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,500
Okay, this is Vigor.

555
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,680
Is it Vigor or Combat?

556
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,400
I feel like Combat.

557
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,260
I see this and I think Strength every time.

558
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Beef is going to have diabetes and a clogged heart.

559
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,440
No!

560
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,680
First we diss, then we patch.

561
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,060
Let's dispatch!

562
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,520
Oh my god.

563
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,880
He's like our best bet, for real.

564
00:38:52,120 --> 00:39:03,460
vigor means strength oh for some reason i see this and i
think stamina okay then golem is our man you should have a

565
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:10,060
backup plan no no you're so good i've been hearing a lot
about some guy named chad i think he's trying to demon but

goodness uh sam wait join the Oh my god, hello?

Is this SDN?

568
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,400
I was driving along the coast, and this guy in front of me
just drove right off the side into the water.

569
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,500
That would make Minto equal to dog dog.

570
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,560
Dog dog.

571
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,380
Dog.

572
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,100
I sent a soup earlier.

573
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,280
I was giving every Ibu going PP a fish bomb.

574
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,420
Don't worry, you get a special one too.

575
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,460
Thank you!

576
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,000
Dog dog, dog, dog.

577
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,480
Okay, we gotta rush people to the hospital, so we need...

578
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,500
We need you.

579
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,680
Or, wait.

580
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,000
You're just guessing.

581
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,720
What's resuscitate?

582
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,180
Would that be an intellect thing?

583
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,440
You know how to do it?

584
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,320
You're like a smarty pants and you know how to...

585
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,400
To...

586
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,540
Do CPR.

587
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,540
So let's do these two.

588
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,500
I think this should be good.

589
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,940
We're gonna join the cult.

590
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,180
Wait, what is this?

591
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,860

Alright, time to get it.

606
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,070
Time to get it.

613
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:27,710

617
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,010
Oh my goodness.

618
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:02,650
What's happening here?

619
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,630
They want us to drink blue liquid from a chalice as a
loyalty test.

620
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,930
Power through it.

621
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,710
You can just see what it is.

622
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,190
Power through it.

623
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:27,320
Oh.

624
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,700
The vibes were off on that one.

625
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,560
I can do better.

626
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:34,700
Oh.

627
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,240
Okay.

628
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,140
I'm having to remember how this game plays.

629
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,780
My bad.

630
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,040
Hey, this is Jason.

631
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,620
They're fine.

632
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,240
They'll be okay.

633
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,180
Someone just dropped off a box of games at the node saying
there's a bomb inside one of them.

634
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:46,440
Oh.

635
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,480
Can you send someone?

636
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,360
Oh, we have one guy.

637
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,500
He's got it.

638
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,600
Wait, what's the other thing?

639
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,580
What's this one?

640
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,240
Where the hell did you go?

641
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,540
Job's not finished, dude.

642
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,680
We need you to bring everything up to our new place.

643
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,300
What?

644
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,300
Oh, my God.

645
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,140
Are you kidding me?

646
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:06,580
Okay.

647
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,560
Coming through.

648
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,940
He's got to go back out.

649
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,000
He's got to go back out.

650
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,460
Wait!

651
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,260
Everybody else is returning.

652
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,460
Okay, we'll wait.

653
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,780
Okay, we'll wait for them to return.

654
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:26,780
Oh my gosh.

655
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,080
Do I have time?

656
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,320
They're resting?

657
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,740
Oh my gosh, wait, wait, wait, wait!

658
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,520
I have a coffee!

659
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,560
Can't catch many of your streams live, but I...

660
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,820
Make sure to check out the VODs.

661
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,720
Thank you for making my work days a lot more bearable.

662
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,420
Crystallize, thank you!

663
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:43,860
Uh...

664
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,560
Oh, I do have upgrades, you're right.

665
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:46,980
Maybe...

666
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,660
Well, I have to still wait.

667
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:50,720
Um...

668
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,610
I think...

669
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,890
I feel like more people...

670
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:57,590
Well...

671
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,070
Let's make her stronger...

672
00:44:59,070 --> 00:44:59,690
Or smarter.

673
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:00,230
No.

674
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:03,270
Charismatic...

675
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:03,770
More...

676
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,030
More charismatic.

677
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:06,550
Charismatic.

678
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:08,730
Give her the...

679
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,830
Give her the charisma.

680
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,530
Sorry, we're fine.

681
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,330
I'm going to give her more vigor.

682
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,790
Do I have time?

683
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,030
Okay, I do, I do, I do.

684
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:29,770
Okay.

685
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,690
All right, we need someone smart.

686
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:37,050
Yes.

687
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,790
Graceful, but deadly.

688
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:41,970
Yes.

689
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:45,370
No, I think Koop's got this.

690
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:46,870
Oh, on her own.

691
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:47,450
No!

692
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:52,210
Bala, I'm gonna kill you.

693
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:52,830
Okay.

694
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:55,690
Prism.

695
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,070
Prism can help.

696
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,670
Oh, wait, you think Prism instead of...

697
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,150
Fine with me.

698
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,290
We needed another backup dance.

699
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,290
Oh, what is this?

700
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:14,650
When assigned to a call, Prism duplicates the hero to her
left, placing their illusion in an empty slot with half

701
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,270
their stats.

702
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:15,710
Oh!

703
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,530
Oh, that's crazy!

704
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,310
We need you to send somebody else.

705
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:22,850
This is too much.

706
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:23,770
This is too much.

707
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:24,950
Uh-oh.

708
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,390
Oh my gosh.

709
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:27,290
Oh, scary.

710
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,570
You sound like my first manager.

711
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,610
I fired his ass.

712
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:32,090
This is freaking bullshit.

713
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,090
We can't be everywhere at once.

714
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:34,850
Shit, y'all.

715
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,510
I can barely even be in one place.

716
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,350
It's clear that cutting sonar has left us vulnerable.

717
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,270
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Koop has a point.

718
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,790
No.

719
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,070
Can you just hang in there a little longer?

720
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:44,610
Yeah, hang in there.

721
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,070
Hang in there.

one

725
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:27,190

to the other Telltale game.

726
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:34,650
This one, I don't...

727
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,610
What is this supposed to be?

728
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:37,970
The wolves are what?

729
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,590
You have two wolves inside me.

730
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:43,670
And it hurts.

731
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,590
I'm gonna go with the wolves.

732
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,460
The wolves inside us was a great game.

733
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,760
It really makes you feel like...

734
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,700
Oh right, we found the bomb.

735
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,220
Yeah!

736
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,500
What's that mean, though?

737
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,360
This has been my favorite game of the season so far.

738
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:05,880
I have to know.

739
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,060
Are you romancing anyone?

740
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,120
Gollum.

They're smart.

744
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,280
Wait, if we destroy the we're at 10.

745
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,580
Destroy seems like better.

746
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,540
We don't need the vigor.

747
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,000
We need the comp or would it be bigger combat?

748

Okay, okay.

Oh, okay, okay.

789
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:30,940
All right.

790
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,460
What does fire taste like?

791
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,300
Pop rocks.

792
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,880
What more spicy?

793
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,500
Kind of like a spicy pop rock.

794
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,800
What the fuck are pop rocks?

795
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:38,880
Pop rocks.

796
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:40,820
Destroy all.

797
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:41,780
Oh, wait.

798
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,260
You know what?

799
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,460
We'll do.

800
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:52,820
I wish I wish they were good Broke her heart what do you

She is rejecting all my stuff Oh my gosh She can stay mad
Okay

802
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,720
This one is going faster.

803
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:21,160
Ah!

804
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:21,900
Okay.

805
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:22,740
Good, good, good.

806
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,460
We got Golem.

807
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,020
Solid.

808
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,120
And punch up.

809
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,960
We'll do the two of them.

810
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:30,300
Hey.

811
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,640
Anybody got eyes on some garbage?

812
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:35,760
And...

813
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:36,780
Garbage?

814
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,500
Why won't you let me?

815
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,080
I only can choose them.

816
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,440
We're just gonna have to hope.

817
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,960
We're just gonna have to pray.

818
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,640
I think I'm done here.

819
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,940
Golem's good for soloing?

820
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,480
I guess I'll try to remember that for...

821
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,240
You're out!

822
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,480
Oh my god, she just actually left.

823
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,060
Oh my god.

824
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:55,800
Oh my god.

825
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,220
She just actually left!

826
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,900
Okay, we're okay.

827
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,880
No, we're not okay!

828
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:08,060
I think it's bad out of this way.

829
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,760
Uh-oh.

830
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,740
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

831
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,240
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!

832
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,240
That was so unlucky.

833
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,960
Oh, we killed this one, though.

834
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,880
That's the gravy, baby.

835
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:23,680
Yippee!

836
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,300
Let's...

837
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:27,900
Oh, my gosh.

838
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,620
Oh, my gosh.

839
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,100
We're going to put you under...

840
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,040
We're going to give you...

841
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,320
You know what?

842
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,540
More combat to you, baby.

843
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,260
More combat to you.

844
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:43,750
And you...

845
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:45,430
Get...

846
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,400
I'm going to...

847
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,500
Do I have any coffee left?

848
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,040
No.

849
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,340
We're so screwed.

850
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,220
Um.

851
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,920
Flambé with the one intellect but five combat.

852
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,120
He's a hymnbo.

853
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,780
You know what?

854
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,960
Let's just do more vigor.

855
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,200
And then...

856
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:18,880
Golem!

857
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,720
We're gonna do more...

858
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,820
I love the way he talks.

859
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,440
Oh my gosh.

860
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,200
This is not good.

861
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,540
We need backup at the mall.

862
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,840
Dozens of youths just started rushing us and looting the
shops.

863
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,080
Catch as many as...

864
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,960
Oh, everybody.

865
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:40,880
I have nobody.

866
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,460
Wait a second.

867
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,160
I have literally nobody.

868
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,400
Oh, okay.

869
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:54,280
Okay.

870
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,860
Catch as many as possible.

871
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,620
Oh no, wait.

872
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,020
Oh, I think Prism would have been...

873
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,660
Or, InvisiGal would have been good.

874
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:03,800
Oh, geez.

875
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,080
I don't have any coffee, you guys.

876
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,560
Don't ask me to use it.

877
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,360
What's this one?

878
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,860
It cleared everyone out already, but, like, someone called
us about a bomb in one of the theaters.

879
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,580
Oh, okay.

880
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,680
That's really awesome.

881
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,440
Um...

882
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,720
My IRL coffee.

883
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,360
I'll just go make a batch.

884
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,200
You know what?

885
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,480
I hate Charles.

886
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,960
I think I'm not gonna go to him.

887
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,440
He can...

888
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,140
He's a mind reader.

889
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,040
She has X-ray vision.

890
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,620
Together they are.

891
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,100
The ultimate invasion of privacy.

892
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:49,700
Oh, sorry.

893
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,520
Is this SDN?

894
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:51,640
We need help.

895
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,420
Protect the couple from each other.

896
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,080
Send someone with good people.

897
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,220
With good... Oh!

898
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,280
Good with people!

899
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:00,740
Oh!

900
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,500
Send someone with good people!

901
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:15,260
Okay.

902
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:16,780
Who's our...

903
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,080
Everybody who's our charmer.

904
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,000
Well, Flambe!

905
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:20,660
Ganbari!

906
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,500
I didn't even see that there.

907
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,180
Oh my gosh, we're losing everything.

908
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,620
Oh my gosh, we're losing everything.

909
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:26,980
Oh, this is so bad.

910
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:32,640
Yay!

911
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,140
Wow.

912
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,440
Keep it up.

913
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,760
Good job, everybody.

914
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,600
Good job, team.

915
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,480
Oh my gosh, which is this one?

916
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,660
It's time for Phil's walk.

917
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:40,720
What?

918
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,300
No, Phil's my dog.

919
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,220
Can you just, like, walk him around the park?

920
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:49,900
Okay.

921
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,120
Why is this a two-person job?

922
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,180
Is it that bad?

923
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,780
Okay, you know what?

924
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,120
I'm going to have to start soloing people, I think.

925
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,840
Phenomenon's still on the 405.

926
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,740
Just passed him.

927
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,400
He's gone from shaking his fist at cars to, sadly, directing
traffic.

928
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,880
Well, at least he's putting his newfound pain to...

929
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,660
Dang, I missed, like, three jobs, I think.

930
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,300
It's pretty bad.

931
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:20,860
blazer was such a heartbreaker is that surprising i'm just
impressed didn't think she had it in her maybe you shouldn't

932
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:29,900
be so quick to judge people gross you sound just like her
you calling me a heartbreaker in your dreams i think she's

933
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:40,300
flirting with me if anyone needs some more hands-on training
is this a this is a skill they already have right so would

934
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,420
they get a second skill

935
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,480
I wish I could have sent Gollum.

936
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:52,940
It enhances.

937
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,020
Second skill.

938
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,640
Okay, okay.

939
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,100
I don't even remember what her first skill is.

940
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,460
So let's do a second skill.

941
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,400
Let me do my shit my way.

942
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,760
What's happening?

943
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,700
Things are definitely getting heated.

944
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,540
Looks like they are about to tear the place apart.

945
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,740
Activate the sprinkler system.

946
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,440
What does that mean?

947
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,700
What does that mean?

948
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,700
Oh, it's the hacking!

949
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,120
Well, that's fine.

950
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,680
I don't know if this will work, but whatever.

951
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,620
Hacker man.

952
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,320
Oh, what the hell is happening here?

953
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,040
Oh.

954
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,140
Oh.

955
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:50,070
Oh.

956
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:51,670
Oh.

957
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,000
Oh, shoot.

958
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,430
Wait, I think I messed up.

959
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:01,540
Ah!

960
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,800
Oh, I got it.

961
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,440
I got it.

962
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,360
Oh, I'm so good.

963
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,000
Ah!

964
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,900
Not good!

965
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,380
Wait, that scared me.

966
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,280
Wait!

967
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,860
This is impossible!

968
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:22,640
Oh!

969
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,120
Okay.

970
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:30,700
Ow!

971
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,120
No!

972
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,580
Wait, oh, exit?

973
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,440
Okay, wait, I get it.

974
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:33,840
I get it.

975
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,750
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

976
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:40,830
Oh my god.

977
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:46,150
Scary!

978
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:47,490
Okay, okay, okay.

979
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,370
This one dies, okay.

980
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,770
Oh, uh, exit.

981
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:00,550
Okay.

982
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:03,930
Okay.

983
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,270
Alright, alright, alright.

984
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:06,650
Alright, alright.

985
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,560
Okay, okay, okay.

986
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:09,610
Oh, whoop.

987
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:11,910
Okay, okay.

988
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:13,750
And...

989
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,550
Wow, they had you thinking for that one.

990
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:20,350
Look at this.

991
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,550
Ready, set, fire.

992
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:29,910
When sent alone, Envisagal reduces travel time and call
completion time.

993
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:31,490
Oh, oh.

994
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:35,490
If Envisagal is on the team, XP rewards are doubled.

995
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:37,530
Okay.

996
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:39,670
Oh, this is the one.

997
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:40,150
Oh, okay.

998
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:46,350
With her connections, Envisagal can reveal the number of
slots and crime type on hover for certain calls before they

999
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:46,830
happen.

1000
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:50,990
Oh, interesting.

1001
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:54,330
Oh.

1002
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,520
This...

1003
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,160
Yeah, scouting or XP.

1004
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,060
I feel like we're gonna go with the pack.

1005
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,480
Okay.

1006
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:21,300
Because I am paranoid and I tend to send out people as teams
anyway.

1007
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,160
So I feel like with how I play, it might be better.

1008
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:31,100
Owl!

1009
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,910
Just a little more effort, please.

1010
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:42,870
Failed a call with a 70% chance of success.

1011
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:44,570
Rude.

1012
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:47,190
Hey, it's Jerry from Comic Pug.

1013
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,790
We got a gift of some Mega Man replicas.

1014
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:58,350
but with all the bomb threats going on we just want to be
sure okay evacuate all civilians inspect

1015

you girl i'm a slow reader all right besides you promised
fairy sex and so far It has to build.

1018
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,070
These are like the books I listen to.

1019
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:25,770
That's crazy.

1020
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,870
Search for Phil the dog.

1021
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,450
Entice him with a friendly demeanor and treats.

1022
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:31,810
You're friendly.

1023
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:34,870
Right.

1024
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:37,630
We're friendly.

1025
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:39,050
We're friendly.

1026
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:42,030
Fairy, what now?

1027
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,310
Oh my gosh.

1028
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:44,530
I'm so glad I'm not a fairy.

1029
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,290
It'd be so awkward.

1030
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:48,510
Hmm.

1031
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:53,050
Which mecha man contains the bomb?

1032
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:55,150
Mecha man prime?

1033
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:56,810
Mecha man astral?

1034
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,290
Mecha man blue?

1035
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,940
Mecha man prime?

1036
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,480
Please say yes.

1037
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,520
It was mecha man prime!

1038
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,560
It was the mini mecha man prime.

1039
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,120
It's flying around the shop and blasting.

1040
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,720
Stop it before it detonates.

1041
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,640
Hit it!

1042
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,040
Yes!

1043
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,000
Yes!

1044
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,260
Yes.

1045
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:29,820
I'm confused.

1046
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,880
I thought that would be more difficult.

1047
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:33,500
Yes.

1048
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:35,980
Let's see.

1049
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,260
Um, I feel like you need to be smarter, Prism.

1050
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,820
We're gonna increase your intellect a little bit.

1051
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:49,280
To be fair, friendly demeanor and treats works with me also.

1052
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,180
Yeah, I think me too.

1053
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:55,460
I think I'm pretty easy to win over.

1054
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,080
What do you mean he...

1055
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,140
God away.

1056
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,400
You better find him, man.

1057
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,920
Oh, what was it?

1058
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,460
Let's just do the both of them.

1059
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:08,160
Aren't you persistent?

1060
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,100
Oh my god.

1061
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,200
They have no friendly demeanor at all.

1062
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,440
This is so bad.

1063
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,240
Invisigal and Punch-Up are good, but they have no charisma.

1064
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:26,490
Column's almost ready.

1065
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:28,430
Okay.

1066
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,790
Gollum, and...

1067
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:33,710
Punch up.

1068
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,950
Hit it cliffside once.

1069
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:36,690
Those two.

1070
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:37,270
Yeah.

1071
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,510
They'll treat him well.

1072
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:40,850
They'll treat him well.

1073
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:43,890
Yeah, I'm so mad.

1074
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:45,690
I miss so many things.

1075
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:48,470
Oh.

1076
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:53,670
Uh-oh.

1077
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,800
Yeah, I'm just like off my game today.

1078
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,840
And that's lunch.

1079
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:06,920
Think fuck.

1080
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,340
Oh my god!

1081
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,900
I'ma drink my spicy water.

1082
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,640
That was terrible!

1083
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,240
I knew I had a good feeling about you.

1084
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,460
I... did I get a rank down?

1085
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,400
Did I rank...

1086
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Did I rank down?

1087
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,560
Or...

1088
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,060
We ain't finding that dog.

1089
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,520
Vagour, too?

1090
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,120
Um...

1091
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,420
Cool!

1092
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:50,350
Invisigal.

1093
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:54,990
Barely miss it, I know.

1094
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,090
This game!

1095
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,830
Oh my gosh, it's the Oedipus arrangement!

1096
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:05,670
He's so tall.

1097
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:09,530
Still working on that?

1098
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:09,990
Hmm?

1099
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:11,710
Aren't these the best?

1100
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,590
I love the green ones.

1101
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:14,950
The green do.

1102
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:15,810
The green do.

1103
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:16,250
Oh, worse.

1104
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:25,930

1108
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:46,990
Damn!

1109
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,110
Just aim your dick up and water piss it off.

1110
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:51,790
That's not...

1111
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:52,490
So mean!

1112
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:54,670
I'm gonna go rinse off.

1113
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:55,590
No!

1114
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:59,610
How would you like to have to walk around work the rest of
the day with shit all of you?

1115
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:00,110
I don't know.

1116
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,910
I don't think about that because it won't happen.

1117
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,350
Oh?

1118
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:02,990
Oh yeah?

1119
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:04,970
Because I'm not a fucking idiot food thrower away or...

1120
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:05,690
It was an accident.

1121
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:07,190
You don't have to be a bully about it.

1122
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:07,710
You have to be a bully.

1123
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:08,710
You want this in your report?

1124
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,590
Well, you're gonna snitch on me?

1125
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:13,210
At least I have eyebrows.

1126
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,270
They're just being a soft bitch about it.

1127
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:17,590
Scareddy!

1128
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:19,770
Oh, am I being a bully?

1129
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:23,050
Why is there spaghetti in the Chinese takeout?

1130
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:23,730
Fuck!

1131
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:26,070
Oh, wow.

1132
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,350
I wasn't expecting it to go straight.

1133
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:29,530
I was extra.

1134
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:30,350
Sorry.

1135
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:31,750
Oh, he's angry.

1136
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:34,130
You're gonna choke on his fucking...

1137
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,790
Hey, Robert, could you...

1138
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:36,190
Spaghetti.

1139
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:38,730
Did you eat my lunch?

1140
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:40,310
Why would you do that?

1141
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,070
Why did he throw away everybody's lunch, though?

1142
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:43,770
Wait a second.

1143
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,410
I was really hungry.

1144
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:46,390
Look at him.

1145
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:49,270
Why did he, he threw away like the whole fridge?

1146
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:51,890
Like he's not very good at the job, I think.

1147
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:53,190
Go get cleaned up.

1148
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:54,870
Then clean this up.

1149
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,190
I've gotten takeout boxes like that from Italian places.

1150
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:57,870
Oh, really?

1151
01:07:58,970 --> 01:07:59,450
Yes.

1152
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:02,490
Yeah, he threw out everybody's lunch.

1153
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:03,230
Okay.

1154
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,430
Whatever that was.

1155
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,030
And then took the melon.

1156
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:10,230
Anyway, you talk to Chase.

1157
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:11,570
Who's it gonna be?

1158
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:13,430
If I'm a man or water boy.

1159
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:14,310
Oh, easy.

1160
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,270
These two are my only options.

1161
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,890
For now, yeah.

1162
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,690
Obviously, we can revisit it.

1163
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:22,810
But Waterboy is already a trainee, sorta.

1164
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:25,690
And you already know Phenomen Man got cut by DTLA.

1165
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,190
Thanks for getting him out of the parking lot, by the way.

1166
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:35,350
It might also help to get, you know, an actual good person
on your team, which I'm positive both of them are.

1167
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:37,150
Let's go with Waterboy.

1168
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:42,630
I think he deserves a shot, and he seems shockingly more
stable than Phenomen Man at the moment.

1169
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:43,950
I hear you.

1170
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:49,450
Um, I might have him take care of this mess before he
starts, but yeah, let's go with it.

1171
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:50,470
I'll let him know.

1172
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,290
He really looks up to you.

1173
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,410
Does he look up to me or...

1174
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:55,930
Wait, does he know I'm Mechaman?

1175
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:58,810
Yeah, but he said he won't tell anyone.

1176
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,130
I guess that's good.

1177
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,170
I'll let him know.

1178
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:03,650
You'll see him in the roster for your next dispatch.

1179
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:04,850
Aww.

1180
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:09,690
I already knew who I was gonna pick.

1181
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,910
I don't need to think about for Mamma Mam.

1182
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,890
Are we checking everybody out?

1183
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,630
Hey, I leave.

1184
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:24,690
It's not, it's my clothes, the waterproof ish.

1185
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:25,350
Ish?

1186
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:26,930
Yeah, that's gonna clog.

1187
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,390
No, no, no, no.

1188
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:29,350
I do this.

1189
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:30,210
See?

1190
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,670
Oh, nasty.

1191
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:38,090
This route you're doing is complete opposite of mine.

1192
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:39,950
Thanks for picking me.

1193
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:41,210
My, my, my.

1194
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:44,050
I'm just really, just to join you.

1195
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:44,570
Jassed.

1196
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:49,310
The word is jazzed, and we're jazzed.

1197
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,450
I have to do that.

1198
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:54,830
I'm even reasonably optimistic that you deserve it.

1199
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:56,890
See you next shift.

1200
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:02,970
I mean, you might be the other way, and we don't know.

1201
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,750
Honestly, that seems like a mix-up I feel like I would make,
though.

1202
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:22,970
like I've done similar all right team hey team we appreciate
you doing your best last shift under the circumstances but

1203
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:34,150
we are here to help more specifically water boy is here to
help so excuse me ain't no way he may be new to this but

1204
01:10:34,150 --> 01:10:43,310
Robert and I believe he will make a great addition to the
team this is bullshit good good morning evening hello this

1205
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:50,150
is a joke right I don't Wait, maybe, is it a joke?

1206
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:53,150
Nope, Waterboy, it's not a joke.

1207
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:56,730
Cool, Leo.

1208
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:57,750
Cool, Leo.

1209
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,610
Oh, oh, sweet Waterboy.

1210
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:05,190
We have reason to believe that Mr. Vanderstank's life will
be in danger of the meeting.

1211
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:06,070
Vanderstank!

1212
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:08,070
Mobilize quickly.

1213
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:11,610
Protect Willem, Willem, four people.

1214
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:13,470
Holy cow.

1215
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:15,090
Okay, we gotta give him a visit, yeah, wait.

1216
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:20,930
Invisigal, if we succeed in this, she'll double all of the
XP.

1217
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:21,530
Typical.

1218
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:23,510
All right.

1219
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:26,310
Water boy, are you ready for your...

1220
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:27,610
What is your stats anyway?

1221
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:29,710
It doesn't matter.

1222
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:34,850
Golem?

1223
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,340
Prism clone.

1224
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,380
What is... Oh yeah.

1225
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,280
Call me a Bogo bitch.

1226
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,820
Oh yeah!

1227
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:45,900
Oh yeah!

1228
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,280
This might be the best thing ever!

1229
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,560
This might be the greatest setup!

1230
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:00,430
I've never seen someone pick Coupe and Water Boys in this
playthrough.

1231
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:00,870
What?

1232
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:03,390
Why is nobody playing Water Boy?

1233
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:05,230
Why is nobody picking him?

1234
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:09,470
Hello SDN, can you dispatch your cutest and talented ghost
man?

1235
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,390

01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:13,530
Alright, let's dispatch.

01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:16,070

01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,250

01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,670
Hey, so we're a little down on new subscribers this month.

1247
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:29,110
Think you can spare here to do some recruiting?

1248
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:31,210
How the fuck are we supposed to do this?

1249
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,510
You could try charming them with your winning personality.

1250
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:34,450
Oh my gosh, Golem!

1251
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:36,550
Golem is perfect for this!

1252
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:40,730
Do you think he would get people to subscribe to my channel
too?

1253
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:44,730
Do you think?

1254
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:48,450
Water boy solo.

1255
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:50,180
I got you.

1256
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,830
Somebody order a mudslide?

1257
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:56,790
Yeah, he would.

1258
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:57,950
Subscribe to my channel.

1259
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:01,510
Send a charming and good-looking hero to join a superhero
dating competition.

1260
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:04,110
Ooh.

1261
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:06,650
Oh.

1262
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:09,210
Good-looking?

1263
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,390
I think he's our best choice.

1264
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,110
Hey, if you were a civi, what would your job be?

1265
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:19,050
I feel like working at a gas station.

1266
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:20,090
here.

1267
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:22,690
Cool, we can do Kubei like I wanted to.

1268
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,630
I hate pets with bad attitude.

1269
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:27,390
What pets have good attitudes?

1270
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:28,290
Oh, you guys!

1271
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:31,290
Yes!

1272
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:31,770
Yes!

1273
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:32,830
Yes!

1274
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,610
And he's gonna get double XP!

1275
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:42,410
Oh, look at him go!

1276
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:43,230
Look at him go!

1277
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:44,410
Quit your day job, kid!

1278
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:47,070
We're gonna make him full of vigor.

1279
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:57,410
Full of of anger his thing is so tiny uh is it from amaman's
like super huge but he then like it's so sad and that's how

1280
01:14:57,410 --> 01:15:04,910
he sabotages you janitor moist janitor moist janitor moist

1281
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:17,150

1282
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:27,730

with that i would rather deal with the wet man six foot four

1283
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:34,350
wow produces water spontaneously throughout his body
crippling social anxiety easily frightened lives with his

1284
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:45,500
grandpa wait a second oh wow they have so many more oh
interesting

1285
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,540
what do we got going on here wait

1286
01:15:54,460 --> 01:16:03,620
Pirouette So this is the one we have On calls with With more
than two slots Coupé gains one combat If placed in first Or

1287
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:11,740
mobility If placed in second Pirouette If Coupé is sent On a
call that fails She will re-attempt it Wait that's kind of

1288
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:18,920
awesome If placed in the first slot Coupé now gains Plus
three combat If placed in second Oh that's tough

1289
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:34,890
I feel like both are life-saving but reattempt especially on
the ones that like we have like an 80% chance or 70% and

1290
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:38,450
then I think reattempt is really good let's go with that

1291
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:43,510
what we got going on here

1292
01:16:51,020 --> 01:17:00,440
I'm gonna stay winning I'm gonna stay winning yes sir and
you're gonna become I'm gonna let's give you a little bit

1293
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:07,060
more intellect so that you're like you're a little chunkier
I'm the firm opinion that Minto can never make a wrong

1294
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,400
decision except kicking out Gollum and firing Sonar.

1295
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,280
Also, my 25th was two days ago.

1296
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,180
I forgot to mention it.

1297
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:13,960
Love you, bye.

1298
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:15,300
Syntax!

1299
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,840
Why didn't you say anything?

1300
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,720
Happy birthday!

1301
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,580
The hero to put on a show?

1302
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,020
We need Terrence the Turtle to beat someone up.

1303
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:26,940
Happy birthday!

1304
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,680
Fake fight.

1305
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,840
The mascot during halftime.

1306
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,160
Make it look convincing.

1307
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,440
I think punch up will be good for this.

1308
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,800
I used to punch bombs on that corner.

1309
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,640
It makes you wonder if the best days are behind us.

1310
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:48,940
It's time to charm.

1311
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:49,940
Flirt away.

1312
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:50,700
Oh no.

1313
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,960
Oh it's time to meet the civilians.

1314
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:52,640
Let's flex.

1315
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,780
Flexing time.

1316
01:17:59,560 --> 01:17:59,980
Wait what?

1317
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,280
It seems no one is interested.

1318
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:02,360
What's plan B?

1319
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:02,820
Oh.

1320
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,040
Flambé!

1321
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,260
Some bananas faster.

1322
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:08,220
Hey, Flambé, you cook, right?

1323
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,060
I'm picking up what you're putting down.

1324
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:10,460
Oh!

1325
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,020
So you finally noticed.

1326
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:14,960
I'm perfect.

1327
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:16,000
Oh!

1328
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:21,460
Let's go!

1329
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,700
We're gonna give you some even more charisma so you don't
mess that up again.

1330
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,720
We've tracked down the assassin's temporary base of
operations.

1331
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,540
Yeah, no.

1332
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,300
No you had that option, now you do!

1333
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,320
Oh, sorry, exit.

1334
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,500
I clicked the wrong thing.

1335
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:53,800
Oh, that doesn't seem good.

1336
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,320
Okay, oh.

1337
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,660
Why did I do this then?

1338
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:12,410
Nice.

1339
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:15,590
Maybe so I can move him there.

1340
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:22,670
Right, right down!

1341
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:23,810
Right, right down!

1342
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:24,910
Right, right down!

1343
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:26,090
Right, right down!

1344
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,750
Left, left up!

1345
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:35,590
Left, left up!

1346
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:40,090
Oh, wait, what was it?

1347
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:40,530
This one?

1348
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:45,590
Wait, why am I doing... Why am I opening this?

1349
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:46,990
Oh, because it opens up there too!

1350
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:47,210
Okay.

1351
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:52,410
Right, right, down, left, left, up!

1352
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,430
Left, up, right, oops.

1353
01:19:57,570 --> 01:19:59,830
Left, left, up, right, right, down.

1354
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,890
Go, go, go!

1355
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,800
Razor Raymond, who's that?

1356
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,360
I speak...

1357
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:18,900
Bisexuals!

1358
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,300
Yeah!

1359
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:24,070
Oh.

1360
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,510
Oh.

1361
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:27,130
What's this?

1362
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:29,130
Water bitch almost took me out back there.

1363
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:30,990
Is there a return policy on this motherfucker?

1364
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:33,030
Yeah, maybe we get someone who doesn't suck.

1365
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:37,690
No, he can't help us!

1366
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:42,370
Take down the located assassins, identify the location of
their boss.

1367
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:47,450
I think we can do the same team as before.

1368
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:51,370
Oh wait, sorry, it's three people.

1369
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:52,730
I for some reason thought four.

1370
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:53,710
Okay, never mind, hold on.

1371
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:55,390
Uh, redo, redo.

1372
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:57,410
We need some smarts in here.

1373
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:02,390
Take down, though.

1374
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:03,790
We also need them to be fast.

1375
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:05,770
Wait, uh...

1376
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:06,530
Not my level, though.

1377
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:07,230
Maybe Coupe.

1378
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:07,810
I don't know.

1379
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:09,270
But definitely.

1380
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:10,410
Like that, maybe.

1381
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:14,330
Invisiplus water?

1382
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:15,190
I don't think...

1383
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:16,010
Oh, whoops, whoops, whoops.

1384
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:17,870
I don't think it'll be enough.

1385
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:19,190
It's time to put an end to this.

1386
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:20,490
Take down his combat.

1387
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:20,970
Oh.

1388
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:22,890
Oh.

1389
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:29,420
Hmm.

1390
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:32,760
Okay.

1391
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:33,800
Okay.

1392
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:37,200
I love a symmetrical stage picture.

1393
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:37,720
Hold on.

1394
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,020
I feel like...

1395
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,200
if Visigal will be better.

1396
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,460
Malila, she can heal injured.

1397
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,320
Make up your mind.

1398
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,420
Okay, you have to stop calling me that.

1399
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:58,560
Fine.

1400
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,160
Let's do it.

1401
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,360
You are about to feel so much better.

1402
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,300
And so am I.

1403
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:08,780
Malila heals one hero when sent on a call together.

1404
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,800
She then receives plus one charisma or vigor.

1405
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,460
This effect stacks.

1406
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:18,660
See, I didn't know that she could heal because I literally
hadn't unlocked it before.

1407
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,040
Oh my god, it's almost exactly him.

1408
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:24,440
Nice.

1409
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,480
We're killing it, you guys.

1410
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,040
We're killing it.

1411
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,080
Hello, dispatcher.

1412
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,180
Would you like to play a little game, perhaps?

1413
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:36,880
A brain teacher.

1414
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,040
How'd you give him my number?

1415
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:46,520
this asshole careful he's tricky his name is brain teaser
brain tickler don't say i didn't warn you

1416
01:22:49,920 --> 01:23:00,060
the brain tickle baby kaiju attack capture the small baby
mini baby kaiju it may be little but it's still strong golem

1417
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:10,640
get in there my goat chicken but capture would be speed no
so maybe we're with a coupé.

1418
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,120
Who is this?

1419
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:18,800
The Riddler.

1420
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:20,260
Gollum has it?

1421
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:20,640
Solo?

1422
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,960
If he loses.

1423
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,340
What is his set?

1424
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:27,020
Wait, hold on.

1425
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:27,680
What is his...

1426
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:29,820
What is his power?

1427
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:31,780
Because...

1428
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:34,100
Expands to fill empty slot.

1429
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,620
Increasing his stats by 25%.

1430
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,480
Okay.

1431
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:41,860
He expands.

1432
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:42,780
That's what it is.

1433
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,380
Humor the brain teaser.

1434
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:46,160
Let's humor him.

1435
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,620
Have you been paying attention?

1436
01:23:49,740 --> 01:24:00,660
Answer my riddles 1, 2, 3 and I will gladly Turn myself in
We need someone smart, don't we?

1437
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,000
High injury risk

1438
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,720
Beater beater beater beater oh, no

1439
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:22,570
Baby Kaiju looks like he wants to play Adop the baby That's
a baby right now

1440
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:28,810
I'm a dad now.

1441
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:29,610
New mom!

1442
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:31,330
Oh my god!

1443
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,370
Wait, that's so cute!

1444
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:38,870
That's so cute!

1445
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,890
More vigor for you.

1446
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:45,770
I love Golem.

1447
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:47,310
What's this guy?

1448
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:50,430
This is a retired SDN hero at Kryptonite causing problems.

1449
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:51,810
Can you get him out of there?

1450
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:52,930
Kryptonite!

1451
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:54,290
Wait, that's such a good pun.

1452
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:55,310
I remember him when I was a kid.

1453
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:56,150
Poor guy.

1454
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:57,190
How you been there?

1455
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:01,430
Before I joined the Z-team, I didn't have a pot to piss in.

1456
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:02,570
He had to borrow one of my...

1457
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:03,490
That's such a good pun.

1458
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:08,390
Attempt to cheer up and persuade the retire...

1459
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:09,910
I feel like this is a good thing for...

1460
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:12,610
Punch-up.

1461
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,110
But he's got the charisma.

1462
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:16,770
And withstand the beer bottles.

1463
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:19,370
I think he's a bit of a kidder.

1464
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:21,070
Wait, what if they go together?

1465
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:23,330
No, we don't need them together.

1466
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:25,030
I think...

1467
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:26,990
And Koop?

1468
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:28,810
That's overkill.

1469
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,920
We'll do it.

1470
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,060
I feel like single mamas, Minto.

1471
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,520
We'll do them together.

1472
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:43,620
They're like a good team.

1473
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,780
I like to keep them together.

1474
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,680
But...

1475
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,540
Oh, yeah.

1476
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,080
Nice.

1477
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:58,730
I say that, too.

1478
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:00,830
Holy moly.

1479
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:01,530
Indeed.

1480
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:02,950
Let's see.

1481
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:04,490
Let's give her some more.

1482
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:06,750
more mobility.

1483
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:08,170
Let's make her faster.

1484
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:12,670
And then, Malevolon.

1485
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,020
We'll give you more charisma.

1486
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,600
And Waterboy.

1487
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,380
You can take literally anything.

1488
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,200
You need everything.

1489
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,860
We'll give you more charisma too.

1490
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:35,600
Okay.

1491
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,460
Look, he's almost...

1492
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,900
Oh, you can't see, but he's almost to another...

1493
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:47,140
He's 827 XP out of a thousand, so he's almost gonna reach
another level soon, too.

1494
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:47,860
Alright.

1495
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,680
We still gotta decide on that, guys.

1496
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,980
Let's maybe not start a war here with an elite assassin
organization.

1497
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:56,160
Try asking them to leave nicely.

1498
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,780
Convince their boss...

1499
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:02,920
Okay, I feel like I have to do Prism...

1500
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,220
Holy moly, Flambe.

1501
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:10,720
but none of they're not very smart which is the issue

1502
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:24,410
bandaid prism oh i have none if i had an item you guys i
would use it but like if i really i guess like i will

1503
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:27,530
honestly i could use the coffee here but i don't know if
it's like

1504
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:42,680
nobody is resting though everybody's returning coming in Big
N, thank you!

1505
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,420
Solo?

1506
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,280
Solo with Prism?

1507
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,360
Because we still need somebody for...

1508
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,520
This.

1509
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,320
Entire Z team receives XP.

1510
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:59,760
We need somebody smart and...

1511
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,340
I think Coupé would be my smartest.

1512
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:10,530
Prism and Flam have a...

1513
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:11,670
Have a synergy?

1514
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:12,430
Let's try.

1515
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:13,870
Oh, wait.

1516
01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:14,930
Oh, wait.

1517
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:17,510
It also doesn't apply here because there's not a third.

1518
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:17,950
You know what?

1519
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:18,370
Whatever.

1520
01:28:18,490 --> 01:28:18,570
Whatever.

1521
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:25,250
We'll see how they are after resting.

1522
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:33,200
Humor?

1523
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:36,060
No, she's not smart enough.

1524
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,620
I need Coupe, for real.

1525
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,820
I think she can do it.

1526
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,820
I think she can do it.

1527
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:46,990
94%.

1528
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:48,310
Let's go!

1529
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:51,190
I'm your hero, baby!

1530
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:53,350
Oh, they do have a synergy!

1531
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:54,330
Whoa!

1532
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:56,830
What was happening?

1533
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:57,950
Why is he doing that?

1534
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,430
Why is he doing that?

1535
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:00,650
What the hell?

1536
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:04,490
100?

1537
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:05,970
How did it get to 100?

1538
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:08,710
Because of their synergy?

1539
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:21,010
Okay, now I can bring Coupé out.

1540
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:22,550
Okay, she's gonna be our girl.

1541
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:25,050
Okay, back to it.

1542
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,950
You're the smartest one here!

1543
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:30,050
We're leaving it to you!

1544
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:37,870
She's the one.

1545
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:38,830
Uh-oh.

1546
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:41,550
Go back to wiping up spills, Janina.

1547
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:47,370
We'll start an easy one.

1548
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,530
What's my favorite game?

1549
01:29:48,910 --> 01:29:50,450
It's the wolf within us, right?

1550
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:57,070
Or what if it's the wolves inside us because that was the
game that they technically said earlier.

1551
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,070
I'm going with my gut.

1552
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:05,910
Favorite movie.

1553
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:09,690
Oh, did we hear about movies before?

1554
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:13,630
Oh.

1555
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,340
That isn't a riddle.

1556
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,320
I know, this guy is so...

1557
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,880
This guy is so full of poo.

1558
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,640
It was the one you missed.

1559
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:30,520
Oh, no.

1560
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:38,750
I'm gonna guess Staying alive

1561
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:57,280
Oh Oopsie Oh so so close We needed a tad Sorry Coupa Holy
cow

1562
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:09,760
Hey not bad though not bad Not only did you cut one of their
dumb shit criminal buddies You're also forcing them to work

1563
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,460
with An actual good person that wants to be a hero.

1564
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:15,460
I was going to go with wet baby bitch boy, but yeah, we can
go with him.

1565
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:16,380
Don't be mean to him.

1566
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,980
He can't help what power he was born with.

1567
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,100
Hey kid, love you.

1568
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,500
Love you too, aren't you?

1569
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,700
Don't fuck this up.

1570
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,180
Unk.

1571
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,480
He got unked.

1572
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:33,870
He can be both.

1573
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:36,330
Don't call him a bitch.

1574
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:40,130
What is this?

1575
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:45,000
Oh!

1576
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,740
Why is that in there?

1577
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,860
Oh my god!

1578
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:51,640
No!

1579
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:54,020
No!

1580
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:07,390
Oh god this dog is huge!

1581
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:08,710
Holy cow!

1582
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:12,710
He's not a weener dog, he's a sausage dog.

1583
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:13,830
Hey mom!

1584
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:14,790
Hey honey.

1585
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:18,130
Oh they just have to rub the family in his face.

1586
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:20,630
We're a place where we'll go back to EQ.

1587
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:23,650
He's all beef.

1588
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,230
Oh my god, he's really limber though.

1589
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:26,270
He's jumping around.

1590
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,550
He was flying.

1591
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,210
Can animals get powers in this world, I wonder?

1592
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:37,670
Yeah, let that dog, make that dog run.

1593
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:40,630
Oh no, he's not running.

1594
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:41,610
Oh, he's lazy.

1595
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:43,810
Oh, no.

1596
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:45,210
Oh, he's running, okay.

1597
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:51,810
Maybe he's so big because he ate the thing that we're trying
to...

1598
01:32:51,830 --> 01:33:09,010
get fat boy plopping about I think he's so big because he

the more you expect failure the more likely it is to happen
yeah i don't think you have a stutter confidence issue

1602
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:54,730

finish the sentence I'm blowing your mind what are you

1603
01:33:54,730 --> 01:34:05,270

1608
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:51,200
I love Waterboy.

1609
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,740
That's extremely inappropriate.

1610
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:58,260
Especially since I'm usually the picker, not the Peggy.

1611
01:34:58,620 --> 01:34:59,020
Noted.

1612
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:00,360
Well, tell me how it is.

1613
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:00,920
No, you're invisible.

1614
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:02,080
Your name's not Peggy.

1615
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:04,360
At least 20 minutes of trailers.

1616
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,120
I always forget what I'm watching by the time the movie
starts.

1617
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,900
I kind of like the trailers.

1618
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:10,300
I'm alone or Robbie.

1619
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,040
A rebel.

1620
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,540
That night, feel bad asking people to pay when I'm just
going to sneak in.

1621
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:15,560
Peggle enjoyers.

1622
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:18,920
Floating buckets of popcorn.

1623
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:21,240
Popcorn too tend to draw a lot of attention.

1624
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:22,720
Oh, but I miss it.

1625
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,260
I miss popcorn.

1626
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,660
Ah, I want some popcorn.

1627
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,360
Oh, I have some right here.

1628
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,860
Chantuck, welcome to bamboo shed.

01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:29,600
Thank you.

1630
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:31,120
Oh.

1631
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:33,060
Oh, for dinner?

1632
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,800
Guys, we are so in.

1633
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:39,990
Oh, wait.

1634

01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:01,930
See ya.

1639
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:05,990
Sorry if there's a gal.

1640
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:08,290
You've had one dream of me.

1641
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:12,430
Too much coffee?

1642
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:14,810
Wait.

1643
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:15,970
Sure.

1644
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:17,210
What's up?

1645
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:19,770
This isn't what I look like.

1646
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:23,070
I don't tell you to know what you mean, but okay.

1647
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:26,390
The powers make me...

1648
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:26,950
It doesn't matter.

1649
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:27,890
I'm just gonna show you.

1650
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:28,390
Wait, what?

1651
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:29,110
Are you good with that?

1652
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:30,350
How?

1653
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:34,330
I have absolutely no idea what's about to happen, so this is
very important.

1654
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:40,790
exciting temper your expectations what is it what am I about
what I don't know what to expect at all

1655
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,500
Okay, does she not have powers is it all the next the

01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:53,660

1659
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:03,980
She's gonna be blue.

1660
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:05,000
She's gonna be blue.

1661
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:07,900
She's gonna be blue She's blue!

1662
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:12,520
She's...

1663
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:13,920
Blunet!

1664
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:14,760
She's a brunet!

1665
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:16,200
Oh, okay.

1666
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:19,620
I'm sorry.

1667
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:20,740
You're disappointed.

1668
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,720
Uh, are you kidding?

1669
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,420
I thought I was gonna be like...

1670
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,000
Are you joking or am I joking?

1671
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:27,420
It's a big difference.

1672
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:27,800
You're what?

1673
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:28,520
Is it?

1674
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,220
And a brunet, come on.

1675
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:31,720
It's...

1676
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,580
She's shorter?

1677
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,760
If it wasn't called blonde blazer, I wouldn't be so
self-conscious about it.

1678
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,280
and they never meet me first.

1679
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,120
It's always the superhero.

1680
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:45,160
It's hard to live up to.

1681
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:55,400
We're so in.

1682
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:58,420
Was

1683
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,200
that less of a mistake than the first one?

1684
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:11,860
A little bit.

1685
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:13,480
I'll take a little bit.

1686
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:18,440
Oh my god, if a mama man's gonna hate us.

1687

Oh, okay.

1702
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:41,800
If she was blue and fuzzy.

01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:43,140
Why fuzzy?

1704
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:43,760
I know.

1705
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:45,160
It's crazy.

Woo woo!

1711
01:40:02,590 --> 01:40:05,890
After watching Two Brunettes kiss, they look like they're
related.

1712
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:10,950
Freak Phantom Strikes again.

1713
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:11,890
What did I say?

1714
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:15,750

1715
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:16,630

Jesse!

1717
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:23,050

1719
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:24,510

01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,520

1721
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:37,640

Oh, there's the gravy man!

1723
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Robert's dating his boss, and we call you boss.

1724
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:50,160
What are you trying to say?

1725
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:53,760
Are you gonna self-insert as Robert?

1726
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,140
I think Robert's a good guy, though.

1727
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,620
You know, so...

Oh, an order of appearance.

1733
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,300
I was going to say, wow.

1734
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,240
They put her first.

1735
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,660
You and 61% of players threw spaghetti at Flambé.

1736
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:51,000
Is it because of the spaghetti that she got spaghetti?

1737
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:55,720
I got skinny on the brain, everybody.

1738
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:58,540
Mm-hmm.

1739
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:03,260
Laura Bailey's husband got in trouble for picking Blazer.

1740
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,060
You and 79% of players warned her about her dress.

1741
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:11,900
See?

1742
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,660
It's better to be honest.

1743
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:18,000
I hate when my boss makes me have romantic dinners.

1744
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:18,680
Oh, I know.

1745
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:19,860
I'll buy you Skeddy.

1746
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:20,940

1749
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:27,900
Tanoy Reed.

1750
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:28,680
Royd.

1751
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:29,800

1752
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,100
The Rock Stunt Double.

1753
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:32,180
What?

1754
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:33,080
No way.

1755
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:39,100
You and 75% of players kept kissing Blonde Blazer a secret.

1756
01:42:40,740 --> 01:42:41,580
Skeddy Fines.

1757
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:42,120
Yeah!

1758
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,060
You and 40% of players adopted the baby Kaiju.

1759
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,600
Why would you not adopt the baby?

1760
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,960
I guess if you don't send out Gollum, then.

1761
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:54,860
You and 80% of players failed to save all three businesses
from the brain teaser.

1762
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:56,040
My bad.

1763
01:42:56,040 --> 01:43:04,900
do you think they had that skeddy at midnight i would hope

1766
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:34,660
You and 23% of players fail to answer all throughout.

1767
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:36,860
It's not my fault!

1768
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:37,920

1769
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:39,920

01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,160
Good?

1774
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:55,200
You activated Hero's powers 40 times.

1775
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,700
Most successful hero was Golem!

1776
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:00,440
Yeah, go, go!

1777
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:06,060
Top 60%!

1778
01:44:06,460 --> 01:44:06,640
Yeah!

1779
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:10,020
You sent the hero...

1780
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:12,600
Perfect hero for the call three times.

1781
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:13,880
Man.

1782
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:16,200
That was episode three, right?

1783
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:17,020
Or four?

1784
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:18,420
It's in episode five?

1785
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:29,650
On to five.

1786
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:30,470
Okay, cool.

1787
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:40,150
Rise and shine!

1788
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:43,450
What are

1789
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:49,850
we doing?

1790
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:54,070
Oh.

1791
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:56,570
I'm being Mechaman.

1792
01:44:57,070 --> 01:44:57,550
That's everybody.

1793
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:58,430
All clear.

1794
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:06,940
Mechaman!

1795
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:13,950
Mechaman!

1796
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:15,570
Some training montage.

1797
01:45:15,930 --> 01:45:17,270
Peak cinema this episode.

1798
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:18,790
Yeah, okay.

1799
01:45:27,390 --> 01:45:31,530
They do count people who went back and did perfect run in
the percentages, so 40% is pretty good.

1800
01:45:31,890 --> 01:45:33,410
Oh, you're right.

1801
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:34,570
Thank you.

1802
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:43,230
Oh wait, are we gonna have the QTEs again?

1803
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:54,030
Thank you for helping with my cope that I'm doing a good
job.

1804
01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:08,930
Took him out one punch.

1805
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:22,540
Uh-oh, there goes some of the foundation.

1806
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:25,660
It's not Culp, it's Coupé.

1807
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:37,070
But his suit is working again.

1808
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:38,990
Unless this is a flashback.

1809
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,630
Because...

1810
01:46:44,630 --> 01:46:44,910
Whoa!

1811
01:46:48,910 --> 01:46:56,930
Oh, a flashback no

1812
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:10,800
you can do it get your gains you need a spotter uh-oh how
are you gonna get out of this one you're not supposed to

1813
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:23,420
live without a spot idiot yeah you need a spotter so weak so
so weak oh now i'm getting a safety lecture from a walking

1814
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:32,020
fireball It's a reality check normies need babysitters so
you don't hurt yourself thinking you're a hero I'm no

1815
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:32,900
normies.

1816
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,920
I'm an otaku You're the king of the normies.

1817
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:45,720
I've seen fucking wet white boy put up more on the bench No
more hero stuff without supervision you can't get injured

1818
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:53,000
because we need you behind that desk to help real heroes
Actually speaking of injuries remind me who burned off your

1819
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:53,720
eyebrows again?

1820
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:58,720
I assume it happens all the time, given your, you know, your
fire shit.

1821
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:02,600
I got into a fight with an actual real, actual hero.

1822
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:06,920
And I assure you, he's regretting his decision to tangle
with me.

1823
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:08,020
What?

1824
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:09,340
It was literally at the bar.

1825
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,740
I imagine he's regretting a lot of his decisions.

1826
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,980
That's fucking right.

1827
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:14,060
And you.

1828
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,200
It's time for you to accept that you don't got it anymore.

1829
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:20,980
And pretending you still do is bombing people the fuck out.

1830
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:21,460
Hey.

1831
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,140
Now, get your flat ass off my bench.

1832
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:26,800
There's two benches here, mister.

1833
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:32,650
His butt is a little flat.

1834
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:36,330
Meantom, my man, is the only hero.

1835
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:37,250
Are you alright?

1836
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:40,810
Flambé said you almost died under some weights.

1837
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:42,070
Something like that.

1838
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:44,510
Oh, is Invisigal spying on me again?

1839
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:45,930
She's kind of a pervert.

1840
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:46,310
I just...

1841
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:46,930
I had a great time.

1842
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:51,030
The other night and wanted to see if maybe you want to do a
real date or something.

1843
01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:56,330
Was it the plastic utensils of the man puking water on the
windows that made that less real?

1844
01:48:56,570 --> 01:49:04,850
there were many contributing factors yeah that'd be a date
with blonde blazer or Mandy oh I don't know which would you

1845
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:15,630
prefer and that's not a trap I'm both of them we'll say
Mandy I mean if I'm pressed I think I'd prefer the girl from

1846
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:28,810
the other night so yeah Mandy will remember that okay she's
like you like me behind The me behind the mask.

1847
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:30,810
This kind of seemed like a trap, though, right?

1848
01:49:33,190 --> 01:49:34,290
Man, Dave.

1849
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:35,650
Actually, maybe...

1850
01:49:35,650 --> 01:49:36,750
You're so lucky.

1851
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:42,070
Maybe we should have said Blonde Blazer because she's taller
than us.

1852
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:44,250
Kind of awesome.

1853
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:46,850
Oh, my God.

1854
01:49:47,170 --> 01:49:48,430
What a sweet...

1855
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:48,690
Oh.

1856
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:50,550
Just...

1857
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:52,070
Don't wipe it on your dog.

1858
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:01,840
Most of my major decisions aren't common.

1859
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:04,440
Really?

1860
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:08,100
Nah, there's...

1861
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,460
I'm sure it's fine.

1862
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:11,020
Oh, oh, we're back into it, baby!

1863
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:12,240
Wait, have some.

1864
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:15,860
Yo, you ever noticed the Torrance vibe is like...

1865
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:16,480
Rancid?

1866
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:21,060
Between the dead fish and the harbor, the giant refinery, it
can't tell who's to blame.

1867
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,260
Let's still punch up a little more charismatic.

1868
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:26,420
I love the smell of the refinery.

1869
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,180
I hate the smell of gasoline.

1870
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:30,020
I love the smell of gasoline.

1871
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:40,400
all right everybody respectfully shut the fuck up who pissed
in your cereal and smarter we need smarter people uh coupe

1872
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:55,280
we're not getting brain tickled again next time all right
gasoline smells so good i can't help it all right here we go

1873
01:50:55,280 --> 01:51:05,280
let's go team we got our first job annual talent show do it
for the kids do it for the kids someone magnetic full of

1874
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:10,520
personality has an eye for good with kids how do i know if
they're good with kids

1875
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:23,180
crime not killing kids i guess i feel like prism would be
like so popular because she has like the the the followers

1876
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:35,580
right charisma let's just do prism I think she'll be fine.

1877
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:37,320
I guess I'll go.

1878
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:38,720
I'll guess I'll go.

1879
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,720
I guess I'll go.

1880
01:51:40,780 --> 01:51:41,340
I guess I'll go.

1881
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:42,060
Golem!

1882
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:42,880
You're right.

1883
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:45,820
Vandastank has requested a rescue.

1884
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:49,300
Vandgo workers are trapped after a tunnel collapse at the
new station.

1885
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:50,680
Get them out safely.

1886
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:52,460
And discreetly.

1887
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:53,580
Discreetly.

1888
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:54,900
Navigate the tunnels.

1889
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,940
Save the workers before they run out of air?

1890
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:57,480
Scary.

1891
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:11,290
I think we need...

1892
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:15,570
Envisagal, Coupe, Gollum.

1893
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:17,550
Holy cow!

1894
01:52:19,010 --> 01:52:20,870
Oh my god!

1895
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:24,650
Uh, that doesn't matter if we need vigor and mobility.

1896
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:26,670
Oh my god!

1897
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:32,810
I feel like Vanderstank is one divorce away from starting a
full-on robot uprising.

1898
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:35,670
Go, welcome back!

1899
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:36,590
Thank you!

1900
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:38,850
Uh oh.

1901
01:52:39,470 --> 01:52:40,350
Disrupted how?

1902
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:48,460
Z team is on the scene, but it's not as easy as pulling the
workers out.

1903
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,000
I think you can squeeze through there.

1904
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:50,460
Robert.

1905
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:51,980
We got Gollum.

1906
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,320
He's doing its thing.

1907
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:54,160
I know.

1908
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:55,540
Yes.

1909
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:57,280
Oh, my God.

1910
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:57,720
The synergy.

1911
01:52:58,020 --> 01:52:59,420
The synergy is synergizing.

1912
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:04,340
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

1913
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,480
Let's do some more.

1914
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:10,680
You know what?

1915
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,640
I think I will start putting some more stuff.

1916
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:16,160
smarts into Visigau, so we have a second smart person.

1917
01:53:20,190 --> 01:53:21,130
Gollum's the goal.

1918
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:21,950
I love him.

1919
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:24,390
He's too good.

1920
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:25,450
Biddle eat it.

1921
01:53:25,570 --> 01:53:26,090
Biddle eat it.

1922
01:53:27,390 --> 01:53:33,790
SDN's tolerable and inclusive workplace make you a great
sponsor for our aliens among us exhibit.

1923
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:36,750
Discovered every hero's starting power.

1924
01:53:37,030 --> 01:53:37,230
Oh, yay.

1925
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:40,670
Waterboy assigns himself when not sent often.

1926
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:42,130
Oh, okay.

1927
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:44,490
E-Gree.

1928
01:53:44,510 --> 01:54:00,990
sponge he gains plus one to the highest stat for that call
and can be alien like hero this suits him so much okay good

1929
01:54:00,990 --> 01:54:14,750
luck not exactly an alien per se but I think this will work

Thank you so much for telling us.

1934
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:50,850
Convince the parents and children to stop fighting.

1935
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:52,970
Convince them non-violently.

1936
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:04,350
Oh my goodness.

1937
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:05,150
Hero training.

1938
01:55:06,030 --> 01:55:06,970
Training time.

1939
01:55:08,890 --> 01:55:11,310
It's training time if anyone's up for it.

1940
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:14,270
She's so awkward, it's so cute.

1941
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:19,370
Learn to fly!

1942
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:19,630
Fly!

1943
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:26,150
We didn't miss our chance for fly!

1944
01:55:28,690 --> 01:55:30,370
Oh my goodness, what's happening here?

1945
01:55:30,970 --> 01:55:33,130
The children are asking about living on another planet.

1946
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:35,250
For Mamma Man!

1947
01:55:36,990 --> 01:55:37,550
Uh...

1948
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:40,890
Enlighten them about life on planet 424.

1949
01:55:46,010 --> 01:55:47,090
It worked, right?

1950
01:55:47,470 --> 01:55:48,850
Oh no, it didn't work.

1951
01:55:49,790 --> 01:55:50,770
Nothing would have worked.

1952
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:53,750
We bombed the place?

1953
01:55:54,410 --> 01:55:55,630
Oh my god, there's children!

1954
01:55:56,270 --> 01:55:56,990
Okay, hold on.

1955
01:55:57,950 --> 01:55:59,570
We gotta convince non-violently.

1956
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:03,390
Golem.

1957
01:56:04,610 --> 01:56:04,810
Go.

1958
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:12,130
And then...

1959
01:56:13,090 --> 01:56:13,630
Uh...

1960
01:56:13,630 --> 01:56:16,030
Outsmart the persistent stalker.

1961
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:17,730
Make him disappear, but not...

1962
01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:18,250
Are you sure?

1963
01:56:19,150 --> 01:56:19,890
You sure?

1964
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:20,370
You sure?

1965
01:56:21,130 --> 01:56:22,970
You don't want to make him disappear?

1966
01:56:25,010 --> 01:56:25,770
You sure?

1967
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:29,150
Let's do these two.

1968
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:31,510
And then we're gonna send...

1969
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:34,790
Okay, we're gonna wait until he's done resting.

1970
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:38,750
And we're gonna send a flambé to learn how to fly.

1971
01:56:39,470 --> 01:56:41,410
Because apparently he doesn't know how to do that yet.

1972
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:46,890
No one will ever know.

1973
01:56:47,870 --> 01:56:48,750
What's happening?

1974
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:52,110
How do you get rid of a stalker?

1975
01:56:53,450 --> 01:56:55,050
I'm gonna delete all his files.

1976
01:56:56,070 --> 01:56:57,370
I'm gonna make him so sad.

1977
01:56:59,370 --> 01:57:13,070
get the backups too and the backups too this is right right
left right left oh

1978
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:34,120

01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:44,660
oh oh Uh...

1980
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,140
Oh my god, the time is still going down.

1981
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:58,320
Is it... right, left, left, right, right?

1982
01:57:58,700 --> 01:57:59,940
Oh my gosh, confusing.

1983
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:04,380
Ah!

1984
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:06,640
He's using protection.

1985
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,300
Go, go, go!

1986
01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:14,280
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.

1987
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,640
Uh, oh shit, oh shit.

1988
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:21,660
Ah, ah, what was it?

1989
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:22,660
Left, left, ah!

1990
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:28,830
I gotta loop him again.

1991
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:32,850
Ow!

1992
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:33,510
Ouch!

1993
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:34,090
Dang it!

1994
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:34,350
Ouch!

1995
01:58:37,730 --> 01:58:38,190
Oh.

1996
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:39,730
Uh.

1997
01:58:42,390 --> 01:58:43,210
Uh.

1998
01:58:45,690 --> 01:58:47,190
It's also reversed!

1999
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:48,290
No way.

2000
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:55,490
Oh.

2001
01:58:57,350 --> 01:58:58,790
Glad I remembered it.

2002
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:02,170
That was so scary.

2003
01:59:03,490 --> 01:59:04,570
I can't do that.

2004
01:59:04,590 --> 01:59:06,070
He's the only victim of his.

2005
01:59:06,570 --> 01:59:08,670
Let's delete all the files on his laptop.

2006
01:59:10,130 --> 01:59:11,110
How'd this go?

2007
01:59:13,790 --> 01:59:15,370
Not so great.

2008
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:17,010
We're fine.

2009
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:18,290
Yes.

2010
01:59:19,110 --> 01:59:21,930
I mean, all things considered, I'll call that a win.

2011
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:23,010
Yeah, me too.

2012
01:59:24,570 --> 01:59:25,370
What now?

2013
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:32,290
Lawrence Middle School is hosting an anti-bullying seminar,
and it would mean a lot if a hero could come talk to the

2014
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:34,570
students and their parents.

2015
01:59:36,330 --> 01:59:37,490
Mm-hmm.

2016
01:59:38,090 --> 01:59:40,410
This is the job for me.

2017
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:42,810
Call me a BOGO bitch.

2018
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:46,860
Yes, no water boy coming out.

2019
01:59:47,390 --> 01:59:48,710
Water boy will help them.

2020
01:59:49,290 --> 01:59:50,350
I'm gonna go out.

2021
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:53,070

Oh shoot, I should have sent Prism home.

Break a leg, but not like that.

2024
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:02,010

couple neighborhoods.

Okay, hold on.

2046
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:09,480
If I send Golem it...

2047
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:10,100
Now that's doable.

2048
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,560
Yeah, see, he says it's doable.

2049
02:02:12,180 --> 02:02:15,060
And then the entire team will get the XP if he makes it.

2050
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:17,100
Let's try.

2051
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:18,860
It's the most bullyable on the Z team.

2052
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:20,520
Wait, but he's not very...

2053
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:21,380
We'll find.

2054
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:21,760
We'll see.

2055
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:22,560
Oh, oh.

2056
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:24,440
Go Go!

2057
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:24,900
Go!

2058
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:28,560
Actually, I'm pretty sure it's me.

2059
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:30,980
Yeah, at least Waterboy can get a girl wet.

2060
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:32,500
Ooh.

2061
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:34,860
Let's do, um...

2062
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:36,600
I'm gonna send Waterboy to Hero Train.

2063
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:38,460
Better get a towel.

2064
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:46,360
Oh!

2065
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:48,340
This could go anyway.

2066
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:49,800
Yes!

2067
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:52,120
Let's go!

2068
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:54,460
Everybody getting points, baby!

2069
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:56,180
Oh yeah!

2070
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:01,340
Let's go.

2071
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:05,820
I am in need of a very specific type of hero for my upcoming
project.

2072
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:10,500
Artists desire someone with an air of mystery and intellect.

2073
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,340
Someone who is unassumingly strong.

2074
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:14,020
I think Coupé is perfect for this.

2075
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:15,900
Because she's strong.

2076
02:03:16,480 --> 02:03:18,380
But she's also so mysterious and cool.

2077
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:20,560
I think she'd be perfect.

2078
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:25,100
Not that I have my point shoes.

2079
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:27,240
Alright, what are we getting?

2080
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:30,340
Waterboy now gains plus three to the highest stat for that
call.

2081
02:03:31,420 --> 02:03:33,080
Waterboy no longer assigns himself.

2082
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:37,720
Waterboy will heal up two heroes when sent on a call
together.

2083
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:40,700
So we can have a...

2084
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:50,400
we could have him stronger ish

2085
02:03:54,500 --> 02:04:03,660
I think having a second healer other than malevola seems
pretty nice I think I'm going to go with that one expanded

2086
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:14,020
powers for four different heroes yeah all right one second
let's see actually let's see what this is first Mysterious

2087
02:04:14,020 --> 02:04:15,720
fire is broken out in the refinery.

2088
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:19,860
We got it under control, but we can't investigate the cause
with all these dangerous fumes.

2089
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:21,460
Flambé.

2090
02:04:21,900 --> 02:04:23,700
I would never blow up a refinery, okay?

2091
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:25,180
They smell like shit.

2092
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:26,140
Sometimes...

2093
02:04:26,140 --> 02:04:29,060
Someone's pushing up the boys' explosion territory.

2094
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:31,720
Oh, wait, what did it say?

2095
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:32,080
Sometimes...

2096
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:33,100
So if I reach...

2097
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:37,040
If I go too far, we will fail.

2098
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,900
Search around the refinery to locate the cause of the
explosion.

2099
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:43,080
Avoid dangerous fumes and flames.

2100
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:43,620
flames.

2101
02:04:46,830 --> 02:04:47,650
I can do that.

2102
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:52,720
Okay, wait, this is kind of tough.

2103
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:54,520
See ya.

2104
02:04:57,180 --> 02:04:59,180
Oh, my guys are too strong.

2105
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:06,600
Sure, I'll hang back.

2106
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:08,600
Hold on.

2107
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:13,640
Oh, who's the one that we got the, if they fail, they try
again?

2108
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:14,780
It was Coupe, wasn't it?

2109
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,740
Dang, but we're not gonna...

2110
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:17,520
She's busy.

2111
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:24,700
Hold on, I'm gonna see if...

2112
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:25,640
if I can get Gollum.

2113
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:35,340
Avoid?

2114
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:36,600
That sounds like mobility.

2115
02:05:39,260 --> 02:05:42,900
And, oh, he would expand so it would make himself stronger.

2116
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:45,680
Yeah, I don't want to do Gollum.

2117
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:52,320
I think maybe this is our dream team right here.

2118
02:05:52,780 --> 02:05:53,440
Wet and ready?

2119
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:56,580
No, no, no.

2120
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:57,640
Wait, hold on.

2121
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:58,020
Fine.

2122
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:15,530
nothing beats the original but this will have to i know i

2123
02:06:15,530 --> 02:06:25,130

true you jealous or something look if you wanted to grab

2124
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:27,550
dinner all you had to do now we need more mobility

2125
02:06:31,890 --> 02:06:33,710
What's the nicest thing you've ever said to me?

2126
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:34,390
Wow!

2127
02:06:36,770 --> 02:06:37,810
Rise up!

2128
02:06:37,950 --> 02:06:39,190
Thank you so much for the thank you!

2129
02:06:39,510 --> 02:06:40,010
Thank you!

2130
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:43,490
That was surprisingly entertaining.

2131
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:46,270
What if we're trying to set up Invisigal and Waterboy?

2132
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:47,110
I'm just saying.

2133
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:51,830
What if?

2134
02:06:52,210 --> 02:06:54,710
Okay, this is probably the last mission I imagine.

2135
02:06:56,630 --> 02:06:57,190
Wait!

2136
02:06:58,970 --> 02:06:59,530
Holy!

2137
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:00,790
Holy!

2138
02:07:02,830 --> 02:07:03,350
Yes!

2139
02:07:04,770 --> 02:07:06,870
Looks like the red ring was behind.

2140
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:08,650
And Draco, thank you so much for the time gifted!

2141
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:10,050
Thank you!

2142
02:07:17,370 --> 02:07:18,410
Holy cow!

2143
02:07:18,570 --> 02:07:20,070
They both have two!

2144
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:26,700
Let's go, let's go!

2145
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:29,520
Actually, yeah, we'll do more mobility.

2146
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:33,200
And gorelim.

2147
02:07:36,780 --> 02:07:39,160
We're gonna increase your intelligence just a tad.

2148
02:07:40,520 --> 02:07:41,340
Good job, Minto.

2149
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:42,000
Thank you!

2150
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:47,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2151
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:49,630
And we're also gonna make you smarter.

2152
02:07:50,170 --> 02:07:51,370
We're gonna make a bunch of people smarter.

2153
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:52,870
I feel like I have not enough.

2154
02:07:53,130 --> 02:07:54,090
Oh, wait, she has two, that's right.

2155
02:07:55,630 --> 02:07:56,550
And more vigor.

2156
02:07:57,650 --> 02:07:59,210
I don't have enough smarter people.

2157
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:03,250
In fact, we're gonna do that for you too, Waterboy.

2158
02:08:03,430 --> 02:08:03,850
There you go.

2159
02:08:05,070 --> 02:08:05,850
Smart!

2160
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:10,720
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

2161
02:08:15,110 --> 02:08:15,890
Yippee!

2162
02:08:16,530 --> 02:08:18,450
Big brains all around.

2163
02:08:23,250 --> 02:08:24,770
Wait, I had a failure?

2164
02:08:25,310 --> 02:08:25,970
Ah man.

2165
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:30,520
I got an injury thing!

2166
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,860
Yeah, finally.

2167
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:41,520
Vigor, huh?

2168
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:51,250
Let's do water, boy.

2169
02:08:51,430 --> 02:08:52,310
We're trying to raise him up.

2170
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:56,690
I know now that I have two healers, right?

2171
02:08:58,650 --> 02:08:59,090
Yippee!

2172
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:03,150
Don't do it.

2173
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:04,570
Don't give that dog nothing.

2174
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:07,010
Maybe he's got an iron stomach.

2175
02:09:07,590 --> 02:09:08,630
Do we know anybody like that?

2176
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:09,470
Super digestion?

2177
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:10,590
The glutinator?

2178
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:11,730
But I don't know.

2179
02:09:12,090 --> 02:09:13,870
That guy would like a thousand pounds.

2180
02:09:15,110 --> 02:09:17,270
Did you recently lose like 700 pounds?

2181
02:09:17,710 --> 02:09:21,010
First off, you're either shit at math or you think I'm like
300 pounds.

2182
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:21,990
I am not.

2183
02:09:22,490 --> 02:09:24,130
I go to the gym and I work hard.

2184
02:09:24,610 --> 02:09:25,490
Secondly, what are you talking about?

2185
02:09:25,530 --> 02:09:27,010
He lost his suit, so kinda.

2186
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:28,370
Which superhero you used to be?

2187
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:31,570
Person who gets his right wins 936 dollars.

2188
02:09:32,070 --> 02:09:33,490
That's a real specific number.

2189
02:09:33,490 --> 02:09:34,310
Cleric of super soakers.

2190
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:35,330
Ha ha ha.

2191
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:36,230
Could be house.

2192
02:09:36,590 --> 02:09:38,010
Just one hint.

2193
02:09:39,090 --> 02:09:40,090
I know my friends, right?

2194
02:09:40,330 --> 02:09:41,390
I'm double jointed.

2195
02:09:42,450 --> 02:09:43,770
I'm double jointed.

queen we rot the hive you would do that kill shroud yes

2204
02:10:57,930 --> 02:11:06,770

there having to think about it you gotta know shroud killed

2205
02:11:06,770 --> 02:11:17,730

2206

my own burrito oh

2208
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:50,060
we're back to work baby we got a few guesses at your
identity leading one right now is blue balls man.

2209
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,420
Nice for an eye.

2210
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:52,960
His power is not being able to nut.

2211
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:54,960
His balls are literally blue, dude.

2212
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:56,460
Get your head out of the gutter.

2213
02:11:57,180 --> 02:11:57,460
Great.

2214
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:59,500
It's going to be a long shift.

2215
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:02,320
Alright, team.

2216
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:04,560
Okay, our first thing in the neighborhood.

2217
02:12:04,940 --> 02:12:06,300
A cat is out there all alone.

2218
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:08,520
So scared, so hungry.

2219
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:10,880
Please find my baby.

2220
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:12,200
Oh my god, Kiara.

2221
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:14,460
That's seriously his name.

2222
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:15,860
Kiara misses her cat.

2223
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:17,440
Everyone's a fucking creative.

2224
02:12:18,020 --> 02:12:19,180
Mr. Cat.

2225
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:19,580
Okay.

2226
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:27,740
I had a cat that was orange once.

2227
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:29,640
His name was Mr. Orange.

2228
02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:36,520
So, you know, maybe we should...

2229
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:40,560
Some people named their pets like John.

2230
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:41,890
So...

2231
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:46,140
His name was Mr. Orange.

2232
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:48,000
Very fast.

2233
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:48,400
Huh?

2234
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:49,380
And hates people?

2235
02:12:49,620 --> 02:12:50,360
Hates most people.

2236
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:01,020
Mr. Orange, the best name.

2237
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:02,620
John Cat.

2238
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:10,100
Did you provide that name and at what age?

2239
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:12,240
Actually, my sister named him.

2240
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:14,080
I had a cat named Kitty.

2241
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:15,360
I have no room to talk.

2242
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:16,920
I...

2243
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:19,680
You know, with Paz, I barely call her name.

2244
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:21,380
I always call her little girl.

2245
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:24,020
Or just girl.

2246
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:26,140
I'll be like, come here.

2247
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:27,280
I'll be like, girl.

2248
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:29,280
Girl, what are you doing, girl?

2249
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:31,140
Where's the little girl at?

2250
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:32,980
I gotta go find me a little girl.

2251
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:34,500
Where's my girl at?

2252
02:13:36,520 --> 02:13:38,900
I barely call her her name.

2253
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:44,720
I once knew this maid who was green and named herself
Maidman.

2254
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:47,480
Maybe this has always been me.

2255
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:51,240
Maybe this has always been.

2256
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:53,380
How I am.

2257
02:13:57,170 --> 02:13:58,390
Probably thinks her name is girl.

2258
02:13:58,870 --> 02:13:59,710
Yeah, probably.

2259
02:14:01,330 --> 02:14:04,630
I like never say her actual name ever.

2260
02:14:04,830 --> 02:14:05,930
I'm always just like, girl.

2261
02:14:06,890 --> 02:14:08,090
Where are you girl?

2262
02:14:08,810 --> 02:14:09,490
Little girl.

2263
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:14,950
It's like Little May from Moomin.

2264
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:16,130
I love Little May.

2265
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:17,510
She's like my favorite character.

2266
02:14:18,230 --> 02:14:21,030
So, Mr. Orange.

2267
02:14:21,570 --> 02:14:23,130
Reservoir dogs reference.

2268
02:14:23,150 --> 02:14:24,390
I don't even know what that is.

2269
02:14:26,610 --> 02:14:29,310
But yeah, I think a lot of people...

2270
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:32,590
And then, like, sometimes I'll have a cat and...

2271
02:14:33,350 --> 02:14:38,050
I give them so many nicknames that I don't even say, like,
their actual name anymore.

2272
02:14:40,150 --> 02:14:42,310
I once had a cat named Slawbird Cat.

2273
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:45,410
I think this is just normal for pet owners.

2274
02:14:47,170 --> 02:14:53,410
My mom was supposed to name our current cat, but because
she's the most indecisive person, kitty.

2275
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:56,850
Which we shorten the kit to be somewhat original.

2276
02:14:57,330 --> 02:14:58,530
I don't think you need to be original.

2277
02:14:58,870 --> 02:15:01,530
I don't think it's going to hurt the animal's feelings.

2278
02:15:02,290 --> 02:15:03,930
If you're just like, puppy.

2279
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:10,610
I know people who name their dogs Spider and Monkey.

2280
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:12,210
Yeah, yeah.

2281
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:15,430
I know people that have named their pets another animal too.

2282
02:15:17,050 --> 02:15:18,250
Have a cat named Tessa.

2283
02:15:18,670 --> 02:15:19,970
We all call her Miss Girls.

2284
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:20,430
See!

2285
02:15:23,710 --> 02:15:25,410
Okay, let's see.

2286
02:15:26,170 --> 02:15:27,010
Hates most people.

2287
02:15:27,530 --> 02:15:28,850
Escape artists very fast.

2288
02:15:30,850 --> 02:15:31,910
Swift as the night.

2289
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:34,410
This might be overkill, but let's try it.

2290
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:37,230
It's probably overkill.

2291
02:15:38,370 --> 02:15:39,010
Whoa, what's happening?

2292
02:15:39,450 --> 02:15:41,830
Did we just lose power?

2293
02:15:43,010 --> 02:15:43,530
Sure did.

2294
02:15:43,930 --> 02:15:44,450
Citywide.

2295
02:15:44,690 --> 02:15:45,090
Hang tight.

2296
02:15:45,230 --> 02:15:46,570
We're booting up the backup generator.

2297
02:15:47,390 --> 02:15:48,570
Wait, was it a trap then?

2298
02:15:48,590 --> 02:15:49,190
There we go.

2299
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:51,230

2300
02:15:51,250 --> 02:15:51,650

02:16:25,850 --> 02:16:27,310
Oh, geez.

2307
02:16:27,990 --> 02:16:27,990
Okay.

2308
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:28,990
Everybody?

2309
02:16:30,290 --> 02:16:31,370
Oh, my God.

2310
02:16:31,570 --> 02:16:31,970
I'm hacking?

2311
02:16:34,490 --> 02:16:36,310
Uh, restart the power.

2312
02:16:36,810 --> 02:16:38,490
Red ring influence detected.

2313
02:16:38,930 --> 02:16:39,410
Oh, no!

2314
02:16:40,350 --> 02:16:40,850
Okay.

2315
02:16:41,430 --> 02:16:42,750
Let's hack, everybody.

2316
02:16:44,410 --> 02:16:45,430
Wait, what's this?

2317
02:16:47,690 --> 02:16:49,110
Gladiator energy charge.

2318
02:16:50,010 --> 02:16:50,750
Over...

2319
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:51,230
Wait.

2320
02:16:51,450 --> 02:16:52,690
Oh!

2321
02:16:55,990 --> 02:16:56,990
Interesting.

2322
02:16:57,870 --> 02:16:57,870
Oh!

2323
02:16:59,910 --> 02:17:00,750
Oh neat!

2324
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:03,310
Oh wow!

2325
02:17:03,470 --> 02:17:04,770
They really just like keep...

2326
02:17:05,530 --> 02:17:06,710
Like doing new things.

2327
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:07,430
It's so cool.

2328
02:17:08,390 --> 02:17:09,310
Can I charge again?

2329
02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:11,330
Oh wow!

2330
02:17:14,130 --> 02:17:14,630
Oh.

2331
02:17:16,250 --> 02:17:17,250
Interesting.

2332
02:17:19,970 --> 02:17:20,970
Interesting.

2333
02:17:21,670 --> 02:17:23,810
Oh, yeah.

2334
02:17:24,030 --> 02:17:24,990
I need a charge here.

2335
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:33,000
Oh, interesting.

2336
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:36,080
Interesting.

2337
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:40,760
Okay.

2338
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:44,740
You got this easy?

2339
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:46,160
At least it's not timed.

2340
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:48,700
They give you, like, a chance to kind of figure out...

2341
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:48,800
Oh.

2342
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:49,940
Wait.

2343
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:51,220
What the heck you're doing?

2344
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:52,140
First.

2345
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:54,240
I need this back.

2346
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:55,200
Wait, why did I...

2347
02:17:55,220 --> 02:17:56,120
Wait, what?

2348
02:17:58,220 --> 02:17:59,860
Am I doing this right?

2349
02:18:00,020 --> 02:18:00,580
I don't even know.

2350
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:03,560
I feel like I convoluted it a little bit maybe.

2351
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:04,940
What else is new?

2352
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:07,980
What the heck?

2353
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:10,120
Yeah, there's no evil orb.

2354
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:10,740
So true.

2355
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:15,600
I've lost contact with the tower and it's pitch black out
here.

2356
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:17,240
I cannot land this thing.

2357
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:21,660
I know this sounds crazy.

2358
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:22,200
Oh my god!

2359
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:24,120
Can you guys catch this thing in the air?

2360
02:18:25,220 --> 02:18:25,620
Flying!

2361
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:29,500
Requires flying!

2362
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:32,220
Coupé is resting!

2363
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:35,920
Okay, we're gonna wait till Coupé is good.

2364
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:38,020
We have a couple seconds.

2365
02:18:39,860 --> 02:18:40,440
What is this one?

2366
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:42,260
You could catch the plane on the ground.

2367
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:44,060
Sounds dangerous.

2368
02:18:44,340 --> 02:18:45,620
Oh, okay, there's two options.

2369
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:46,460
Okay, okay, okay.

2370
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:52,320
What kind of burrito are you gonna get after stream?

2371
02:18:52,520 --> 02:18:53,660
I like breakfast burritos!

2372
02:18:53,980 --> 02:18:54,480
Also, hi Mito!

2373
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:54,600
though.

2374
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:55,560
Hi, Eric!

2375
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:58,680
Um, I don't know.

2376
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:01,360
I have to see what my local place has.

2377
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:05,600
Light aircraft unable to land, take a risk, and then utilize
the ground team.

2378
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:13,360
No, I think we... What if we make it slip and slide?

2379
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:18,860
I think we got this in the air.

2380
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:20,420
Wait, Coupe!

2381
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:22,760
Oh, you can fly, right?

2382
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:23,540
Oh, never mind.

2383
02:19:23,540 --> 02:19:34,700
Okay, uh, we gotta we gotta do we gotta do ground team, but
we gotta do ground team All right, water boy Okay, got it

assistance let's see let's do we need some smarty pants so

2388

let's do malevola and prism yeah let me finish this talk up
oh spooky Spooky!

2389
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:27,300
Why is that spooky?

2390
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:29,660
The tower's back on, but the refinery is still in a shit
state.

2391
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:30,920
Can you lend a hand?

2392
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,200
Oh my god, not this again.

2393
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:34,400
Why do we have to be so careful?

2394
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:38,300
Repairing the refinery, haul the damage out of the way.

2395
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:41,780
Any delays could cause another explosion, so move quickly.

2396
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:45,940
This is scary.

2397
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:48,620
I don't think the refinery is gonna make it, everybody.

2398
02:20:52,300 --> 02:20:54,940
Um, I think it's, it's all up to you, Invisigal.

2399
02:20:55,480 --> 02:20:57,880
Anything could happen in a blackout.

2400
02:20:58,360 --> 02:20:59,860
Mostly, like, bad shit, though.

2401
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:00,800
Hello.

2402
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:03,680
My baby brother ate my mommy and daddy.

2403
02:21:16,690 --> 02:21:16,870
What?

2404
02:21:19,850 --> 02:21:22,110
Calm the super-powered baby.

2405
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:25,930
Rescue the parents out of the pocket dimension.

2406
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:28,190
What does that mean?

2407
02:21:28,530 --> 02:21:29,130
What is this?

2408
02:21:29,630 --> 02:21:31,770
The XP of the scenario will be two times.

2409
02:21:33,070 --> 02:21:35,090
Wait, these are getting crazy now, huh?

2410
02:21:37,170 --> 02:21:40,450
If we do these two...

2411
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:42,830
Is that reaching?

2412
02:21:49,320 --> 02:21:50,360
Cannibalism mentioned.

2413
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:52,780
Just send all three.

2414
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:53,740
Okay.

2415
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:56,700
No, I think it does.

2416
02:21:57,640 --> 02:21:58,160
Superpose.

2417
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:00,320
Oh no, it doesn't.

2418
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:00,900
Yeah, okay.

2419
02:22:01,080 --> 02:22:01,880
We gotta send all three.

2420
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:03,200
Wait, what is that?

2421
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:04,480
Oh, there's synergy.

2422
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:07,980
I hope nothing else happens.

2423
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:11,800
Uh-oh.

2424
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:13,680
Uh-oh.

2425
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:17,400
How do you stop a plane from crashing?

2426
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:18,940
Ooh, we don't have either of those.

2427
02:22:19,260 --> 02:22:20,080
Catch the plane.

2428
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:21,600
You got this.

2429
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:23,740
Catch the plane.

2430
02:22:27,730 --> 02:22:28,790
I told you.

2431
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:29,130
Oh, for real?

2432
02:22:29,970 --> 02:22:30,470
Just kidding.

2433
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:31,470
I told you.

2434
02:22:32,630 --> 02:22:35,510
I told you they could do it together.

2435
02:22:36,730 --> 02:22:37,390
I told you.

2436
02:22:40,770 --> 02:22:42,130
Oh my goodness.

2437
02:22:42,830 --> 02:22:43,490
God damn it.

2438
02:22:43,590 --> 02:22:45,370
The Red Ring stealing shipments right off the train.

2439
02:22:45,870 --> 02:22:47,050
We're not equipped to stop them.

2440
02:22:47,710 --> 02:22:47,990
Red Ring?

2441
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:49,850
Fuck them up for me, yeah?

2442
02:22:50,150 --> 02:22:51,710
Secure the stolen shipments.

2443
02:22:51,870 --> 02:22:53,410
Defeat the Red Ring goons.

2444
02:22:54,550 --> 02:22:56,330
Um, one second.

2445
02:22:57,570 --> 02:22:59,990
We gotta do the power outage, maybe.

2446
02:23:02,430 --> 02:23:03,270
Red Ring.

2447
02:23:03,590 --> 02:23:04,230
Red Ring.

2448
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:04,810
Red Ring.

2449
02:23:05,830 --> 02:23:07,210
La la la la.

2450
02:23:08,090 --> 02:23:09,530
La la la la la la.

2451
02:23:22,740 --> 02:23:23,400
Let's see.

2452
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:25,100
Let's see what this hint is first.

2453
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:27,640
Up, up, left, right.

2454
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:29,240
Up, left, right.

2455
02:23:30,920 --> 02:23:31,360
Hello.

2456
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:34,960
Oh, whoops.

2457
02:23:35,220 --> 02:23:35,400
Wait.

2458
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:36,340
There we go.

2459
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:37,220
Up, left, right.

2460
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:39,040
Up, left, right.

2461
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:41,020
Up, left, right.

2462
02:23:41,620 --> 02:23:41,780
Up, left, right.

2463
02:23:42,260 --> 02:23:43,220
Up, left, right.

2464
02:23:45,880 --> 02:23:46,980
Up, left, right.

2465
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:02,280
Uh, I need both, right?

2466
02:24:03,860 --> 02:24:04,220
Yeah.

2467
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:06,900
There we go.

2468
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:09,620
Up, left, right.

2469
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:11,560
Easy.

2470
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:16,940
Uh-oh.

2471
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:18,860
Maybe that was bad.

2472
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:20,460
Oh, we have, like, literally nobody.

2473
02:24:20,980 --> 02:24:23,720
Vandals are defacing the Torrance Library mural.

2474
02:24:25,460 --> 02:24:27,820
there are peens everywhere.

2475
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:32,360
Catch the peen, peens.

2476
02:24:39,110 --> 02:24:43,110
This one was fight the guys and do it fast.

2477
02:24:44,990 --> 02:24:49,110
I think we need to take Invisigal out.

2478
02:24:49,650 --> 02:24:50,390
Where do you need me?

2479
02:24:50,970 --> 02:24:51,430
Not here.

2480
02:24:51,630 --> 02:24:51,890
Oh, whoops.

2481
02:24:52,770 --> 02:24:53,230
No, please.

2482
02:24:54,170 --> 02:24:54,650
And here.

2483
02:24:54,990 --> 02:24:55,650
Here, here, here, here.

2484
02:24:58,610 --> 02:24:59,090
Waiting?

2485
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:00,270
What do you mean waiting?

2486
02:25:01,310 --> 02:25:01,810
Yeah, waiting.

2487
02:25:02,750 --> 02:25:03,570
Wait, why will... Wait?

2488
02:25:03,970 --> 02:25:04,090
Huh?

2489
02:25:06,550 --> 02:25:06,850
Why?

2490
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:16,940
Click the check mark.

2491
02:25:17,380 --> 02:25:18,120
What check mark?

2492
02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:23,860
Oh, oh, oh!

2493
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:24,900
These, these, these!

2494
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:25,740
Oh, shoot!

2495
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:26,300
I forgot.

2496
02:25:28,540 --> 02:25:30,680
I got so into everything else.

2497
02:25:34,810 --> 02:25:35,290
Yippee!

2498
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:37,510
The type of shit I'm on, you wouldn't understand.

2499
02:25:38,830 --> 02:25:39,310
Alright.

2500
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:42,470
Talk about impatient.

2501
02:25:44,150 --> 02:25:45,530
Because I didn't finish the jobs.

2502
02:25:46,510 --> 02:25:48,150
I didn't make it.

2503
02:25:48,390 --> 02:25:50,350
After a lifetime of solo work.

2504
02:25:50,990 --> 02:25:51,510
Dang it.

2505
02:25:52,670 --> 02:25:55,970
Ah, I missed two now.

2506
02:25:56,630 --> 02:25:58,870
What's a good line to text a guy in the blackout?

2507
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:00,270
I'm looting the Ralphs.

2508
02:26:00,390 --> 02:26:00,930
You want anything?

2509
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:03,730
You always did the quarter in the dark.

2510
02:26:03,950 --> 02:26:04,890
You say boo.

2511
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:06,450
Dang it.

2512
02:26:07,210 --> 02:26:08,390
Then we got three for three, doll.

2513
02:26:09,510 --> 02:26:11,490
Oh, wait, I've lost everything!

2514
02:26:11,830 --> 02:26:13,290
Oh my god!

2515
02:26:13,670 --> 02:26:16,850
They told me to call SDN.

2516
02:26:17,190 --> 02:26:17,990
I'm just an intern.

2517
02:26:19,650 --> 02:26:22,010
This is the scientist in stabilizing the serum.

2518
02:26:22,330 --> 02:26:24,650
Act quickly before it destroys all of torrents.

2519
02:26:24,770 --> 02:26:25,190
Cool?

2520
02:26:26,710 --> 02:26:27,490
Let's see.

2521
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:31,270
Let's give you some more...

2522
02:26:31,270 --> 02:26:35,510
Let's do some more vigor.

2523
02:26:36,310 --> 02:26:38,010
She's so well-rounded, isn't she?

2524
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:49,530

And then for you, we'll give you some more charisma.

2529
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:22,700
Oh, Coupé, too.

2530
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:23,380
Oh, my gosh.

2531
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:26,180
Mobility.

2532
02:27:31,150 --> 02:27:33,110
Oh, so we can't...

2533
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:33,370
Oh.

2534
02:27:36,870 --> 02:27:37,670
Was it...

2535
02:27:37,670 --> 02:27:41,530
Wasn't there a way to, like, reset the stats and
redistribute, or was that a skill?

2536
02:27:41,650 --> 02:27:42,190
I can't remember.

2537
02:27:43,430 --> 02:27:43,830
Jackie!

2538
02:27:44,210 --> 02:27:45,070
Thank you so much for the fight.

2539
02:27:45,230 --> 02:27:45,970
Good to thank you.

2540
02:27:51,950 --> 02:28:01,530

2543
02:28:26,310 --> 02:28:27,830
Nobody 100% is this game.

2544
02:28:28,270 --> 02:28:29,130
It's fine.

2545
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:33,500
Yes.

2546
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:36,140
I'm heading downtown.

2547
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:37,480
See who can use some help.

2548
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:38,740
Feel free to send someone.

2549
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:40,220
Let's do my level up.

2550
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:49,840
Oh, it was a lot of smarts.

2551
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:51,640
Oh, I think we're okay.

2552
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:53,200
Oh my gosh.

2553
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:55,300
I was supposed to say I think we're okay, though.

2554
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:57,120
Very professional.

2555
02:28:58,360 --> 02:28:59,120
Holy cow.

2556
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:03,640
Hi, it's me again.

2557
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:07,980
You're not going to believe this, but now there's some scary
dudes with scary weapons.

2558
02:29:08,240 --> 02:29:09,480
I'm quitting after this, man.

2559
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:10,760
I can't do this.

2560
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:13,580
Red Ring is after the serum.

2561
02:29:13,700 --> 02:29:15,040
Prevent them from stealing it.

2562
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:19,740
Let's try.

2563
02:29:25,220 --> 02:29:26,300
Wait, what did...

2564
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:27,820
Prevent them from stealing.

2565
02:29:27,940 --> 02:29:29,140
Does that need to be mobile?

2566
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:33,560
Maybe.

2567
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:34,040
Hold on.

2568
02:29:36,020 --> 02:29:37,200
Maybe this instead.

2569
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:38,560
Yeah.

2570
02:29:40,060 --> 02:29:41,780
Oh yeah, oh yeah, baby.

2571
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:42,400
Oh yeah.

2572
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:44,520
All right, let's do this then too.

2573
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:45,820
Our skills.

2574
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:54,920
Oh, so you do still are able to do skill points though.

2575
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:55,900
Okay, that's so good.

2576
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:01,880
Because I thought once they reached rank 10, you couldn't do
skill points on them anymore.

2577
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:02,980
Okay, nice.

2578
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:03,420
Oh.

2579
02:30:04,120 --> 02:30:04,540
What?

2580
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:06,520
What's the point of maxing?

2581
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:08,320
Why is it called maxed out there?

2582
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:12,340
You can sneak in a few more levels.

2583
02:30:25,390 --> 02:30:27,290
Default for most heroes.

2584
02:30:31,050 --> 02:30:32,850
Let's do some more smarts, baby.

2585
02:30:34,090 --> 02:30:35,350
Actually, more charisma.

2586
02:30:35,890 --> 02:30:36,990
Ah, more smarts.

2587
02:30:38,730 --> 02:30:40,270
Just don't question it.

2588
02:30:40,350 --> 02:30:40,650
Okay!

2589
02:30:42,590 --> 02:30:44,490
I'm gonna wait until they're done.

2590
02:30:45,690 --> 02:30:47,630
Everybody's like working so well now.

2591
02:30:47,990 --> 02:30:50,850
Nobody's like, you know, nobody's sabotaging or anything.

2592
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:54,810
Stop the red ring.

2593
02:30:54,990 --> 02:30:57,170
The tiny vial could destroy this entire city.

2594
02:30:58,950 --> 02:30:59,830
I think we need to fight them.

2595
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:01,030
Do I even need to say it?

2596
02:31:01,530 --> 02:31:01,990
Consume!

2597
02:31:02,450 --> 02:31:03,510
I should have seen it.

2598
02:31:04,890 --> 02:31:06,470
I should have done that one instead.

2599
02:31:09,810 --> 02:31:11,310
They're all working together.

2600
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:17,050
Ready, set, fire.

2601
02:31:17,350 --> 02:31:18,030
Whoa, oh yeah.

2602
02:31:18,710 --> 02:31:18,910
Let's see.

2603
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:22,930
After healing a hero, Malevila also creates a portal near
the call once per shift.

2604
02:31:24,130 --> 02:31:26,510
The portal lasts 45 seconds after call completion.

2605
02:31:28,610 --> 02:31:28,770
What?

2606
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:35,400
Oh, I think that one would be better.

2607
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:41,180
After healing a hero, Malevila also reveals the stat of the
next call.

2608
02:31:46,420 --> 02:31:47,500
We'll do the portal.

2609
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:49,980
All right.

2610
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:53,080
I think we're ready to do the next area.

2611
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:00,620
Oh no, no, no, no!

2612
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:06,220
Oh!

2613
02:32:09,020 --> 02:32:10,060
So scary.

2614
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:11,260
Holy cow.

2615
02:32:11,420 --> 02:32:12,640
Oh, okay, I have to...

2616
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:16,240
Oh!

2617
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:16,740
Oh!

2618
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:17,080
Oh!

2619
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:17,500
Shoot!

2620
02:32:17,860 --> 02:32:18,040
Ow!

2621
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:20,360
Oh my god, that was so close.

2622
02:32:22,940 --> 02:32:25,640
I didn't see that guy, this guy scared me.

2623
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:26,860
Okay.

2624
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:32,880
Oh, he scared me.

2625
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:34,120
He scared me good.

2626
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:37,120
Nearly there.

2627
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:38,160
Nearly there.

2628
02:32:39,140 --> 02:32:40,320
Oh, he got me good.

2629
02:32:42,400 --> 02:32:43,440
She was so sneaky.

2630
02:32:55,690 --> 02:32:57,210
All right, we're fine, we're fine.

2631
02:32:57,230 --> 02:33:06,570
hide him behind my big head I should remember that if you
know the the room is several looting's in progress if

2632
02:33:06,570 --> 02:33:16,010
they're still red then that's scary red means scary oh basic
bitches out here wearing ski masks and robin banks where's

2633
02:33:16,010 --> 02:33:30,230
the originality these team provide back up let's see yeah
apprehend the thieves I think we could do

2634
02:33:39,630 --> 02:33:43,950
Punch up for the Honestly, Invisigal is so good, though

2635
02:33:49,610 --> 02:33:56,810
Prison for the Doppel That's what I was thinking But I want
Punch up for the Synergy We'll do the Synergy We have to

2636
02:33:56,810 --> 02:34:03,810
stop meeting like this I think it'll be okay If not for
these blackouts I know if the Prince of Darkness returns

2637
02:34:03,810 --> 02:34:07,010
Fane's feelings by now This is unacceptable.

2638
02:34:07,990 --> 02:34:09,030
I crave revenge.

2639
02:34:09,130 --> 02:34:10,650
Let a girl read her smut.

2640
02:34:11,370 --> 02:34:12,630
We've got other shit to do.

2641
02:34:13,350 --> 02:34:13,750
Let's see.

2642
02:34:13,930 --> 02:34:14,430
For you!

2643
02:34:17,890 --> 02:34:19,830
We're gonna sue some more, big girl.

2644
02:34:24,070 --> 02:34:25,510
Ah, man.

2645
02:34:25,690 --> 02:34:26,430
Easy job.

2646
02:34:27,150 --> 02:34:29,390
I said after I didn't...

2647
02:34:29,390 --> 02:34:31,010
After I missed like three calls.

2648
02:34:32,410 --> 02:34:34,230
High priority search and rescue mission.

2649
02:34:35,250 --> 02:34:36,710
for Andrew.

2650
02:34:37,230 --> 02:34:38,690
Andrew's very important.

2651
02:34:40,430 --> 02:34:42,530
Local missing, locate the missing teens.

2652
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:49,720
Oh, oh!

2653
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:52,100

Yeah.

2655
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:54,840
Well done.

2656
02:34:55,260 --> 02:34:56,620
Good job, team.

2657
02:34:57,860 --> 02:34:58,760
What's this one?

2658
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:00,680
Dude, we're sandwiched in here.

2659
02:35:00,920 --> 02:35:02,100
I can't feel my foot.

2660
02:35:03,140 --> 02:35:06,000
Major multi-car pile up.

2661
02:35:07,100 --> 02:35:10,460
Severe blockage, remove civilians safely to the vehicles,
push them...

2662
02:35:10,460 --> 02:35:12,340
Okay, so Gollum's gotta be here.

2663
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:15,520
Remove them safely.

2664
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,180
Gollum solo?

2665
02:35:21,260 --> 02:35:21,600
Maybe.

2666
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:25,840
Gollum and Waterboy.

2667
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:28,340
Nah, we'll just gollum solo.

2668
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:32,980
Hey, it's like barking shit out here.

2669
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:36,380
Locate the missing teens.

2670
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:38,840
We'll do Invisigal.

2671
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:41,660
Prism.

2672
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,860
I love a symmetrical stage picture.

2673
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:46,000
Wait, what is this one, though?

2674
02:35:47,700 --> 02:35:48,660
Got on the go.

2675
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:52,720
Catch up to the youths on e-bikes.

2676
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:54,560
Oh, thank you, Vito.

2677

2678
02:35:56,240 --> 02:35:58,040
I'm so sorry about your missing daughter.

2679
02:35:58,720 --> 02:35:59,680
It wasn't you, right?

2680
02:36:04,550 --> 02:36:06,110
Not the e-bikes.

2681
02:36:08,030 --> 02:36:09,550
Yes, the e-bikes.

2682
02:36:12,030 --> 02:36:19,610

If you can have the same superpower of Amizagal, how long
can you hold your breath, Minto?

2690
02:37:39,410 --> 02:37:40,430
I'm a ghost?

2691
02:37:42,190 --> 02:37:43,710
I already kind of have that power.

2692
02:37:44,590 --> 02:37:45,810
A lot of people can't see me.

2693
02:37:46,110 --> 02:37:47,650
A lot of people don't have a sixth sense.

2694
02:37:50,070 --> 02:37:53,260
but what does that happen to hold my breath have to do with
it

2696
02:38:08,170 --> 02:38:16,670

became a vampire they were like you have to pretend that

2697
02:38:16,670 --> 02:38:26,980
you're breathing so that you don't scare anybody oh she has

02:39:12,680 --> 02:39:14,300
We're going to be like, hey, oh, wait.

2726
02:40:59,470 --> 02:41:02,270

2733
02:41:15,030 --> 02:41:16,150
Someone let him in!

2734
02:41:16,250 --> 02:41:16,830
He's cold!

2735
02:41:17,290 --> 02:41:19,450
I wanna fall in love and eat pizza all the time.

2736
02:41:20,590 --> 02:41:21,930
Why are you out here?

2737
02:41:21,930 --> 02:41:22,790
Too damn big.

2738
02:41:22,910 --> 02:41:23,710
Do you want a drink?

2739
02:41:24,110 --> 02:41:24,490
No!

2740
02:41:25,090 --> 02:41:25,590
You want two?

2741
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:26,570
Sure.

2742
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:31,150
Why would they live?

2743
02:41:31,710 --> 02:41:32,030
Creep.

2744
02:41:33,450 --> 02:41:33,990
I don't know.

2745
02:41:34,590 --> 02:41:35,110
Get your hands.

2746
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:36,570
And I don't like not knowing people.

2747
02:41:36,930 --> 02:41:37,410
Solidus?

2748
02:41:37,530 --> 02:41:38,750
Get your hands off of him.

2749
02:41:39,350 --> 02:41:41,170
He's the biggest perv west of the LA River.

2750
02:41:42,170 --> 02:41:43,810
And he's with us?

2751
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:46,510
Uh, she's joking.

2752
02:41:46,730 --> 02:41:47,690
I'm not my business.

2753
02:41:48,230 --> 02:41:52,250
But if you do go jerking off in the bathroom, You make it my
business.

2754
02:41:52,610 --> 02:41:53,470
Whoa, cool.

2755
02:41:54,030 --> 02:41:55,850
I don't want to be in that business.

2756
02:41:57,190 --> 02:41:58,830
You made him sit outside too.

2757
02:41:59,510 --> 02:42:01,170
I got karmaed hard.

2758
02:42:04,610 --> 02:42:06,230
Oh my goodness.

2759
02:42:06,830 --> 02:42:08,150
This is what all bars are like.

2760
02:42:09,650 --> 02:42:10,950
Why do they think he's a pervert?

2761
02:42:11,130 --> 02:42:11,890
Is it the caller?

2762
02:42:13,590 --> 02:42:14,450

2766
02:42:20,370 --> 02:42:22,050
Oh, it's a villain bar.

2767
02:42:23,950 --> 02:42:27,190

Buy me a drink.

2770

here?

Nine shitty whiskeys.

2782
02:42:53,230 --> 02:42:53,650
Good lad.

2783
02:42:54,010 --> 02:42:55,290
We should have avoided him earlier.

2784
02:42:55,510 --> 02:42:56,950
When you thought he was a fucking knock?

2785
02:42:57,210 --> 02:42:58,050
He never said that.

2786
02:42:58,390 --> 02:43:00,610
He said he reminded me of my ex and he's not good.

2787
02:43:00,770 --> 02:43:02,270
Uh, you're, you're buying next.

Cheers.

2791
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:10,450
Oh.

2792
02:43:10,870 --> 02:43:11,290
Hello.

2793
02:43:12,050 --> 02:43:12,930
Excuse me.

2794
02:43:19,500 --> 02:43:20,380
Excuse me.

2795
02:43:20,600 --> 02:43:21,060
Um, sir.

2796
02:43:21,640 --> 02:43:22,880
When, when you have a moment.

2797
02:43:23,100 --> 02:43:23,800
Take one of these.

2798
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:24,800
Aw.

2799
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,200
Do I owe this?

2800
02:43:26,440 --> 02:43:27,160
You, you.

2801
02:43:27,900 --> 02:43:28,100
Sir?

2802
02:43:28,400 --> 02:43:29,000
You're good.

2803
02:43:29,660 --> 02:43:30,200
Have fun.

2804
02:43:32,540 --> 02:43:33,540
Look, be honest.

2805
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:36,460
Am I going to make a fool of myself if I sing Whitney
Houston?

2806
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:37,840
Are you Whitney Houston?

2807
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:40,060
No, say that he won't.

2808
02:43:40,380 --> 02:43:41,640
No, make him sing!

2809
02:43:41,960 --> 02:43:42,860
Make him sing!

2810
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:43,120
Make him sing!

2811
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:45,140
I want to hear it.

2812
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:47,160
Damn.

2813
02:43:48,560 --> 02:43:51,860
See, this is why we kept her on the team and not Batman.

2814
02:43:53,140 --> 02:43:54,480
You don't need to bribe me anymore.

2815
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:55,960
I'm in your debt now.

2816
02:43:56,080 --> 02:44:00,420
If you ever need somebody removed.

2817
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:03,100
See?

2818
02:44:03,720 --> 02:44:04,640
She's awesome.

2819
02:44:05,940 --> 02:44:07,420
Oh my god, he's waiting for his drink.

2820
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:10,320
He can't have that outside.

2821
02:44:15,330 --> 02:44:15,970
Nice.

2822
02:44:16,270 --> 02:44:16,630
Ah!

2823
02:44:20,410 --> 02:44:21,870
He's so nice.

2824
02:44:22,110 --> 02:44:23,690
Look, everybody likes us now.

2825
02:44:24,110 --> 02:44:24,610
Oh, okay.

2826
02:44:28,070 --> 02:44:29,350
We have nowhere to sit.

2827
02:44:29,550 --> 02:44:30,630
Nobody to sit with.

2828
02:44:32,090 --> 02:44:33,270
This is kind of lonely.

2829
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:36,150
A crunch.

2830
02:44:38,030 --> 02:44:40,210
We have a dream team, honestly, you guys.

2831
02:44:40,870 --> 02:44:41,650
Everyone thinks I'm a narc.

2832
02:44:42,830 --> 02:44:44,570
They can still smell the hero on you.

2833
02:44:45,130 --> 02:44:45,590
You're the enemy.

2834
02:44:46,030 --> 02:44:46,950
I bought them drinks.

2835
02:44:47,150 --> 02:44:47,750
What's a narc?

2836
02:44:48,590 --> 02:44:49,750
You can buy them drinks.

2837
02:44:50,230 --> 02:44:51,930
You can make sure they don't get fired.

2838
02:44:52,610 --> 02:44:56,970
You can line them up and blow them one by one, but they're
still going to think you might be the hero that fucked up

2839
02:44:56,970 --> 02:44:58,630
the A snitch, a cop!

2840
02:44:59,770 --> 02:45:00,190
Oh!

2841
02:45:02,390 --> 02:45:04,430
Currently enjoying some whiskey myself!

2842
02:45:04,570 --> 02:45:05,070
Let's go!

2843
02:45:06,870 --> 02:45:07,370
Oh!

2844
02:45:08,550 --> 02:45:09,870
Just tell him who you are.

2845
02:45:10,390 --> 02:45:12,450
What are the odds that you've busted any of them anyway?

2846
02:45:14,630 --> 02:45:16,150
Wow, pretty high maybe.

2847
02:45:17,830 --> 02:45:19,110
Ha ha ha!

2848
02:45:27,500 --> 02:45:29,180
Arcotics Division of Police.

2849
02:45:30,520 --> 02:45:34,020
Oh, so I thought narcotics, so I was like...

2850
02:45:38,260 --> 02:45:39,220
Thanks guys.

2851
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:46,000
Come on, babe.

2852
02:45:55,620 --> 02:45:57,060
Is that all you got?

2853
02:45:57,260 --> 02:45:58,320
Come on, you out of gas?

2854
02:45:59,640 --> 02:46:00,120
Disappointing.

2855
02:46:00,400 --> 02:46:00,580
Yeah!

2856
02:46:07,800 --> 02:46:09,780
Oh wow, he's got a lot left.

2857
02:46:11,180 --> 02:46:11,500
Where's all that?

2858
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:12,500
Where do you keep all that?

2859
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:13,760
Where's like that store?

2860
02:46:27,690 --> 02:46:29,510
Don't recognize him with the eyebrows.

2861
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:31,490
It really changes his character.

2862
02:46:32,390 --> 02:46:34,470
He should just embrace it and shave them off completely.

2863
02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:55,660
a bitch whose name is robert i'm a bitch yeah i'm a dick i'm
such a fucking bitch i have no hopes i have no dreams

2864
02:46:55,660 --> 02:47:07,340
because i'm tiny little thing and it doesn't even function
anyway i thought he lost a working in a job he was missing

2865
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:18,540
him the whole time i never noticed my cat's name is narco he
was i'm glad Somehow makes less sense than what you just

2866
02:47:18,540 --> 02:47:19,320
said.

2867
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:24,620
So, you can see, uh, why I'm worried about getting
incinerated.

2868
02:47:25,780 --> 02:47:27,260
We all pay for who we used to be.

2869
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:30,440
The sooner you get it over with, the sooner we get a fresh
start.

2870
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:32,640
You've heard me when I said incinerate.

2871
02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:33,060
Right.

2872
02:47:33,240 --> 02:47:36,360
Who let a loser-ass bitch of a hero into our supervillain
bar?

2873
02:47:37,420 --> 02:47:38,640
Why is everyone?

2874
02:47:39,580 --> 02:47:40,760
You want to die for a bitch?

2875
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:42,360
Don't answer that.

2876
02:47:44,440 --> 02:47:49,760
He came over just to say, That's so mean!

2877
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:50,880
That's so mean!

2878
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:52,720
Are you lost or something, bitch?

2879
02:47:53,020 --> 02:47:55,560
When you're trying to get fucked up.

2880
02:47:57,900 --> 02:47:58,380
Um...

2881
02:47:58,380 --> 02:48:01,200
Since you twisted my arm, what is that one?

2882
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:04,080
Well, since you twisted my arm...

2883
02:48:04,080 --> 02:48:06,540
No one's talking to you, fucking...

2884
02:48:06,540 --> 02:48:09,240
I see they finally gave you some arms.

2885
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:10,280
They can reach your dick.

2886
02:48:12,180 --> 02:48:15,000
There's some people that want to talk to you, you piss a
bitch.

2887
02:48:18,300 --> 02:48:20,940
I like how it said everyone will remember that.

2888
02:48:21,260 --> 02:48:22,400
What are they gonna remember?

2889
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:25,620
Uh-oh, everybody's bad here.

2890
02:48:25,800 --> 02:48:26,940
Oh, wait, it's a villain bar.

2891
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:27,500
That's right.

2892
02:48:32,710 --> 02:48:34,750
Everyone's with the red ring.

2893
02:48:38,050 --> 02:48:38,550
Here.

2894
02:48:39,470 --> 02:48:39,950
Try this.

2895
02:48:41,170 --> 02:48:42,270
Are we getting tacos?

2896
02:48:45,230 --> 02:48:45,910
Oh, no.

2897
02:48:46,270 --> 02:48:46,810
Everybody got pizza.

2898
02:48:48,330 --> 02:48:51,990
Is the can I spent spends reporting?

2899
02:48:52,190 --> 02:48:52,850
It's expensive.

2900
02:48:53,310 --> 02:48:56,570
Can I get my money back paid, please?

2901
02:48:57,050 --> 02:48:57,470
Oh, man.

2902
02:48:57,630 --> 02:48:59,090
I want a taco so bad right now.

2903
02:49:03,930 --> 02:49:06,790
I ordered three triple crunch tacos.

2904
02:49:09,790 --> 02:49:10,430
Oh,

2905
02:49:14,090 --> 02:49:17,450
oh, okay.

2906
02:49:17,650 --> 02:49:17,850
Here we go.

2907
02:49:18,010 --> 02:49:18,250
Here we go.

2908
02:49:18,750 --> 02:49:20,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2909
02:49:20,610 --> 02:49:21,550
Oh, QT!

2910
02:49:21,730 --> 02:49:22,470
Oh, what was that?

2911
02:49:23,170 --> 02:49:24,450
What was that big old...

2912
02:49:29,910 --> 02:49:31,250
People at the villain bar?

2913
02:49:31,470 --> 02:49:33,950
Yeah, don't even...

2914
02:49:33,950 --> 02:49:36,510
She temporarily blinded me!

2915
02:49:36,610 --> 02:49:38,010
She blinded me too!

2916
02:49:38,150 --> 02:49:40,010
Oh my gosh, please, I'm trying to play the game.

2917
02:49:42,350 --> 02:49:43,690
No, I didn't order that.

2918
02:49:43,790 --> 02:49:44,690
I ordered three tacos.

2919
02:49:44,730 --> 02:49:47,010
Three Triple Crunch tacos, yeah, you murdered it 50 times.

2920
02:49:47,610 --> 02:49:48,630
Just eat that.

2921
02:49:48,750 --> 02:49:49,870
It's the same shit anyway.

2922
02:49:49,870 --> 02:49:53,730
Given the man is three triple crunch tacos.

2923
02:49:54,570 --> 02:49:55,370
Hot sauce?

2924
02:49:57,010 --> 02:49:58,150
You drunk or concussed?

2925
02:49:58,910 --> 02:50:00,110
I'd go with both.

2926
02:50:00,710 --> 02:50:02,050
Or do some friendly fire.

2927
02:50:04,310 --> 02:50:05,030
Friendly fire.

2928
02:50:05,330 --> 02:50:07,870
I like how the way they got you ready for the QTEs.

2929
02:50:08,830 --> 02:50:09,170
Like this?

2930
02:50:09,250 --> 02:50:10,870
This is so funny to get you ready.

2931
02:50:15,880 --> 02:50:16,980
Oh my god.

2932
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:36,520
You don't show hands after touching all them filthy
nutsecks.

2933
02:50:38,420 --> 02:50:39,040
Ew.

2934
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:40,210
Tarty seems salty.

2935
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:41,260
Ew!

2936
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:43,660
Ooh, there she is.

2937
02:50:43,820 --> 02:50:44,380
Thanks, babes.

2938
02:50:45,100 --> 02:50:45,940
Source it up for me and everything.

2939
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:48,540
I think you're looking for these.

2940
02:50:48,700 --> 02:50:49,020
Ah.

2941
02:50:49,900 --> 02:50:51,940
Give the man his crunchy tacos.

2942
02:50:53,740 --> 02:50:54,980
More QT?

2943
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:55,800
E!

2944
02:50:56,580 --> 02:50:57,520

02:51:11,930 --> 02:51:12,790
Oh shoot!

2948
02:51:13,190 --> 02:51:13,910
There was a hold?

2949
02:51:14,570 --> 02:51:15,430
My bad.

2950
02:51:26,080 --> 02:51:28,660
I like seeing her actually like work.

2951
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:29,140
It's fun.

2952
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:33,860
Robert is insane though.

2953
02:51:34,840 --> 02:51:35,900
You still want that burrito?

2954
02:51:46,440 --> 02:51:48,260
This is so insane.

2955
02:51:50,140 --> 02:51:51,220
Oh my god.

2956
02:52:01,550 --> 02:52:02,730
What is Waterboy doing?

It's a mind game.

A freaking tactic.

I'm sorry to anybody named Robert.

3017
02:56:05,790 --> 02:56:07,210
I'm such a fucking bitch.

3018
02:56:07,390 --> 02:56:12,190
I have no hopes, I have no dreams, and a tiny little thing.

3019
02:56:12,830 --> 02:56:16,010
And it doesn't even function anyway.

3020
02:56:16,510 --> 02:56:17,690
Because I've been wrecked at this function.

3021
02:56:17,930 --> 02:56:19,830
Take me as I am.

3022
02:56:20,510 --> 02:56:21,990
Just tiny little bitch.

3023
02:56:22,230 --> 02:56:22,430

02:56:26,090 --> 02:56:27,330
I'm so sorry, Robert.

3026
02:56:27,910 --> 02:56:28,050
Rob.

3027
02:56:28,270 --> 02:56:28,610
Rob.

3028
02:56:30,690 --> 02:56:40,930
Going to extremes, tomorrow I will change And today won't
mean a thing Poetry, I'm a bitch, I'm a lover, I'm a child

3029
02:56:40,930 --> 02:56:51,870
I'm a mother, I'm a sinner, I'm a saint I do not feel
ashamed I'm your head, I'm your dream I'm nothing in between

3030
02:56:51,870 --> 02:56:56,470
I love this world, we do this every other way I'm sorry?

3031
02:56:56,750 --> 02:56:57,770
That's so hard Sorry.

3032
02:56:58,330 --> 02:56:58,810
Fuck!

3033
02:56:59,530 --> 02:57:00,210
What's what happened?

3034
02:57:04,090 --> 02:57:05,230
I'm a...

3035
02:57:05,230 --> 02:57:05,530
I'm a...

3036
02:57:05,530 --> 02:57:06,010
I'm a prodigy.

3037
02:57:06,190 --> 02:57:07,790
I'm an editor prodigy.

3038
02:57:08,110 --> 02:57:09,410
I'm an editor prodigy.

3039
02:57:10,110 --> 02:57:11,170
I do airbase too.

3040
02:57:11,330 --> 02:57:12,290
I do air drums.

3041
02:57:12,850 --> 02:57:14,490
I'm fucking the Jackson 5 by myself.

3042
02:57:14,830 --> 02:57:15,830
Number 3.

3043
02:57:16,390 --> 02:57:17,150
Lift off.

3044
02:57:17,190 --> 02:57:18,010
I'm a... Oh.

3045
02:57:18,630 --> 02:57:19,590
Oh, my bad.

3046
02:57:20,130 --> 02:57:22,870
It's easily swappable for Frogbert.

3047
02:57:23,110 --> 02:57:26,550
I could never say that about him.

3048
02:57:27,870 --> 02:57:29,450
I think it's cool.

3049
02:57:30,070 --> 02:57:30,410
You do.

3050
02:57:30,690 --> 02:57:31,810
strong, bad energy.

3051
02:57:32,010 --> 02:57:32,570
It really does.

3052
02:57:32,770 --> 02:57:34,610
Don't try to save me.

3053
02:57:34,910 --> 02:57:37,990
So my brother, this song, his name's Robert, he loved it.

3054
02:57:38,170 --> 02:57:39,290
It's very tough.

3055
02:57:40,930 --> 02:57:44,390
I'm a mother, I'm a sinner, I'm a saint.

3056
02:57:44,950 --> 02:57:46,770
I do not feel ashamed.

3057
02:57:47,150 --> 02:57:49,490
I'm your help, I'm your dream.

3058
02:57:49,890 --> 02:57:51,630
I'm nothing in between.

3059
02:57:52,010 --> 02:57:55,670
You know you wouldn't want it any other way.

3060
02:57:55,950 --> 02:57:59,150
I'm a myth, I'm a phantom, I'm a myth.

3061
02:57:59,530 --> 02:58:00,550
I'm a myth.

3062
02:58:00,690 --> 02:58:10,510
on my knees when you get hurt when you suffer i'm your angel
undercover like shaft i've been numb i'm relieved can't say

3063
02:58:10,510 --> 02:58:16,950
i'm not alive or leave that would be good to leave uh any
other way you're not alone any other day leave with the pain

3064
02:58:16,950 --> 02:58:37,150
that vacation huh I think I just gave him the mic and said,
all right, do your thing.

3065
02:58:37,210 --> 02:58:41,070
You got to get a new Z-Team guy because, like, I'm fucking,
I'm like opening for Taylor.

3066
02:58:42,750 --> 02:58:43,050
Taylor?

3067
02:58:45,190 --> 02:58:46,190
He's a Swiftie.

3068
02:58:55,290 --> 02:58:56,930
He's an improv comic.

3069
02:58:58,330 --> 02:58:59,390
I love improv.

3070
02:58:59,990 --> 02:59:01,270
I saw, what's his name?

3071
02:59:02,330 --> 02:59:04,690
The guy who voices Sonic in the movies.

3072
02:59:05,350 --> 02:59:06,050
Ben Schwartz.

3073
02:59:06,630 --> 02:59:08,890
He does improv and I went and saw him once.

3074
02:59:10,470 --> 02:59:11,130
That was so funny.

3075
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:18,380
Yay!

3076
02:59:21,100 --> 02:59:22,740
Oh, I forgot to click this.

3077
02:59:22,820 --> 02:59:23,140
Oh my gosh.

3078
02:59:23,540 --> 02:59:27,980
You and 20% of players told the Z team you were just Robert.

3079
02:59:31,540 --> 02:59:32,500
I'm really...

3080
02:59:32,500 --> 02:59:36,380
Sorry, some of my choices are quite unconventional, it
seems.

3081
02:59:38,600 --> 02:59:42,320
You and 59% of players chose to go on a second date with
Mandy.

3082
02:59:48,140 --> 02:59:50,040
20% should have been honest.

3083
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:50,620
What?

3084
02:59:50,900 --> 02:59:52,780
What a different experience or what!

3085
02:59:55,440 --> 02:59:56,340
Do you want...

3086
02:59:56,340 --> 02:59:59,280
Wow, we would have never learned that his name was Bruno.

3087
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:06,980
You and 40% of players told Chase they would kill Shroud.

3088
03:00:07,460 --> 03:00:08,620
Yeah, and I'd pick that again.

3089
03:00:09,200 --> 03:00:10,680
What are the chances of...

3090
03:00:10,680 --> 03:00:11,340
Of what?

3091
03:00:12,080 --> 03:00:15,000
Of studio send VAs to karaoke and just...

3092
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:16,500
I think that's honestly what they did.

3093
03:00:18,300 --> 03:00:19,940
I've been watching this stream up to this...

3094
03:00:19,940 --> 03:00:20,880
To part where the team...

3095
03:00:20,900 --> 03:00:22,320
got tacos because of my partner.

3096
03:00:22,460 --> 03:00:23,640
I decided to get Taco Bell.

3097
03:00:23,860 --> 03:00:26,080
So thank... That's why I'm feeling tacos.

3098
03:00:27,240 --> 03:00:28,660
She's not like other girls.

3099
03:00:31,140 --> 03:00:35,520
You and 75% of players held your own against the red ring at
the Sardine?

3100
03:00:36,940 --> 03:00:37,620
We sure did.

3101
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:39,620
We don't do group think here.

3102
03:00:39,740 --> 03:00:40,300
We don't think.

3103
03:00:40,680 --> 03:00:41,880
I just click something.

3104
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:45,700
You and 74% of players saved the Torrance Middle School
Talent Show.

3105
03:00:46,740 --> 03:00:49,660
You and 42% of players chose to send the ground team to the
rescue.

3106
03:00:50,140 --> 03:00:50,880
I mean...

3107
03:00:50,900 --> 03:00:53,620
We only have, we got rid of our other flyer.

3108
03:00:55,300 --> 03:00:57,260
Invisigal was my most sentiero.

3109
03:00:58,720 --> 03:01:01,260
I performed better than, um, 50-50, baby.

3110
03:01:03,340 --> 03:01:04,620
Invisigal was most successful.

3111
03:01:12,480 --> 03:01:15,760
Alright, this out, that was four and five.

3112
03:01:17,040 --> 03:01:19,420
There's eight episodes, right?

3113
03:01:19,780 --> 03:01:21,680
If I'm remembering correctly.

3114
03:01:24,480 --> 03:01:26,280
Visit, Visi is growing up.

3115
03:01:26,300 --> 03:01:39,940
I mean a visit gal is growing on you eight episodes so we
did four and five I wonder if I should do the rest hmm we do

3116
03:01:39,940 --> 03:01:49,680
the next the last three on Wednesday eight is a long one one
more then oh okay

3117
03:01:57,220 --> 03:01:58,860
8 is a little longer.

3118
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:07,400
You don't want to pause at 6.

3119
03:02:07,800 --> 03:02:08,520
Wait, what do you mean?

3120
03:02:13,720 --> 03:02:15,280
6 has a cliffhanger.

3121
03:02:17,580 --> 03:02:19,960
So then maybe...

3122
03:02:19,960 --> 03:02:21,440
Yeah, 6 to 8.

3123
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:25,920
Maybe 6 to 8 then.

3124
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:28,700
I don't think a cliffhanger is a spoiler, guys.

3125
03:02:29,220 --> 03:02:29,820
I don't think so.

3126
03:02:29,900 --> 03:02:30,380
I think it's okay.

3127
03:02:34,400 --> 03:02:41,160
So then we'll stop, we will, we will, but then it's kind of
exciting to kind of want you to come back to watch the next

3128
03:02:41,160 --> 03:02:44,740
stream if I stop if I do six.

3129
03:02:57,560 --> 03:02:59,140
Eight is very long.

3130
03:02:59,200 --> 03:03:01,080
Six is a cool place to end it.

3131
03:03:01,800 --> 03:03:05,300
I'm gonna just, the only thing is I'm hungry, but I guess we
could do six.

3132
03:03:09,020 --> 03:03:19,740
we could do six your dodge powers are insane tonight wait
what did i dodge the spoiler did i dodge a spoiler or did i

taco I'll leave the stream up and then we Come back and we

3137
03:04:11,550 --> 03:04:13,450
do episode six.

3138
03:04:18,260 --> 03:04:19,460
How about that?

3139
03:04:20,160 --> 03:04:21,240
I'm a big girl.

3140
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:22,240
I'm a grown-up.

3141
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:25,820
Yeah, sounds good.

3142
03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:29,660
Okay, let me put on some music.

3143
03:04:32,060 --> 03:04:33,620
I'll put on...

3144
03:04:33,620 --> 03:04:34,040
Let's see.

3145
03:04:42,770 --> 03:04:45,190
I will go get a taco.

3146
03:04:46,130 --> 03:04:46,570
Wait, hold on.

3147
03:04:46,670 --> 03:04:47,970
I'm going to dress this up a little bit.

3148
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:53,080
Taco.

3149
03:05:00,980 --> 03:05:02,640
This should be like 15 minutes.

3150
03:05:03,640 --> 03:05:04,400
It's not very far.

3151
03:05:07,080 --> 03:05:09,860
VOD watchers don't skip anything.

3152
03:05:41,020 --> 03:05:42,420
Wait, I could have a countdown.

3153
03:05:44,240 --> 03:05:47,640
But if it takes me longer, maybe people will think it's...

3154
03:05:47,640 --> 03:05:48,540
Well, no, I'll do a countdown.

3155
03:05:49,580 --> 03:05:50,960

3168
03:07:05,440 --> 03:07:05,980
Let's see.

3169
03:07:07,820 --> 03:07:09,900

03:07:28,760 --> 03:07:29,520
Thank you.

3177
03:07:30,860 --> 03:07:34,790
It looks ridiculous.

3178
03:07:46,540 --> 03:07:47,320
Okay, timer.

3179
03:07:48,020 --> 03:07:48,820
Countdown.

3180
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:53,800
From...

3181
03:07:53,800 --> 03:07:55,220
Taco Funds!

3182
03:07:55,220 --> 03:07:55,940
Thank you!

3183
03:07:58,920 --> 03:08:00,320
Thank you!

3184
03:08:00,840 --> 03:08:01,740
Wait, I have to...

3185
03:08:01,740 --> 03:08:02,560
Countdown, countdown.

3186
03:08:06,320 --> 03:08:07,700
15 minutes.

3187
03:08:09,480 --> 03:08:10,540
15 minutes.

3188
03:08:11,920 --> 03:08:12,860
I believe, I believe.

3189
03:08:16,520 --> 03:08:18,040
And, uh...

3190
03:08:18,040 --> 03:08:19,020
Uh...

3191
03:08:19,020 --> 03:08:21,680
I'm wasting so much time doing all this.

3192
03:08:24,240 --> 03:08:25,000
Uh...

3193
03:08:25,860 --> 03:08:26,620
Alright.

3194
03:08:29,120 --> 03:08:32,960
Oh my gosh, imagine if I forgot to repeat the music too.

3195
03:08:33,740 --> 03:08:36,700
Taco colored super thank you!

3196
03:08:37,740 --> 03:08:38,360
Countdown!

3197
03:08:41,540 --> 03:08:42,720
Oh, why does it say draw?

3198
03:08:50,260 --> 03:08:50,910
Why does it...

3199
03:08:51,380 --> 03:08:52,700
Oh, oh, oops!

3200
03:09:00,920 --> 03:09:02,460
There we go.

3201
03:09:06,110 --> 03:09:07,830
We're doing Fox on it!

3202
03:09:08,230 --> 03:09:09,810
Okay, I'll be right back everybody!

3203
03:09:11,130 --> 03:09:12,230
I'll be back.

3204
03:09:13,030 --> 03:09:14,730
I'll be back!

3205
03:09:16,310 --> 03:09:17,070
Be good.

3206
03:22:30,560 --> 03:22:31,780
Were you guys good?

3207
03:22:32,680 --> 03:22:33,820
Little iBooz?

3208
03:22:35,040 --> 03:22:35,500
Were you?

3209
03:22:36,260 --> 03:22:38,560
Were you good iBooz?

3210
03:22:40,220 --> 03:22:40,720
Yeah?

3211
03:22:41,620 --> 03:22:42,320
Scattering!

3212
03:22:42,500 --> 03:22:42,860
No!

3213
03:22:43,480 --> 03:22:44,780
Why are we scattering?

3214
03:22:46,840 --> 03:22:48,560
Why are we scattering?

3215
03:22:49,620 --> 03:22:50,800
What did you do bad?

3216
03:22:51,600 --> 03:22:52,240
Confess.

3217
03:22:54,100 --> 03:22:55,600
Confess your sins to Minky.

3218
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:00,060
I cheated and watched Twitch.

3219
03:23:01,960 --> 03:23:04,540
I don't know if there's any forgiving of that one.

3220
03:23:07,800 --> 03:23:08,240
Yay!

3221
03:23:08,960 --> 03:23:09,560
Oh wow!

3222
03:23:09,680 --> 03:23:10,440
We just got some...

3223
03:23:12,900 --> 03:23:13,780
Some ridders.

3224
03:23:13,960 --> 03:23:14,440
Thank you!

3225
03:23:15,540 --> 03:23:17,020
Thank you so much.

3226
03:23:17,760 --> 03:23:18,240
Hello, hello.

3227
03:23:18,420 --> 03:23:21,460
I'm going to eat my taco a little bit while the counter
still goes down.

3228
03:23:22,840 --> 03:23:26,400
Actually, I got a crunch wrap, Supreme.

3229
03:23:33,460 --> 03:23:34,740
It's not even a taco.

3230
03:23:39,590 --> 03:23:41,050
I have to get something fast!

3231
03:23:41,910 --> 03:23:43,450
Taco Tuesday, everybody!

3232
03:23:44,390 --> 03:23:44,950
Yippee!

3233
03:23:48,010 --> 03:23:49,010
Yeah, taco!

3234
03:23:56,520 --> 03:23:58,400
I guess let's just get into the next game.

3235
03:23:58,660 --> 03:23:59,640
Or next chapter, I mean.

3236
03:24:00,320 --> 03:24:05,040
Can I have one to taste test?

3237
03:24:09,420 --> 03:24:10,500
How is it?

3238
03:24:11,540 --> 03:24:12,080
How is it?

3239
03:24:12,460 --> 03:24:12,460
Chomp?

3240
03:24:13,280 --> 03:24:13,660
Chomp?

3241
03:24:25,410 --> 03:24:26,410
What was that?

3242
03:24:27,290 --> 03:24:28,230
Why did my computer do that?

3243
03:24:28,710 --> 03:24:29,190
What was that?

3244
03:24:29,530 --> 03:24:30,090
That scared me.

3245
03:24:30,290 --> 03:24:30,830
What was that?

3246
03:24:37,660 --> 03:24:39,760
Oh, it was the timer.

3247
03:24:40,220 --> 03:24:40,540
Draw.

3248
03:24:42,120 --> 03:24:43,280
Scared me.

3249
03:24:56,040 --> 03:24:57,040
Scared me.

3250
03:24:58,240 --> 03:24:58,600
Draw.

3251
03:25:00,760 --> 03:25:01,220
All right.

3252
03:25:01,240 --> 03:25:04,440
Let me turn off the music and let's get back into it, guys.

3253
03:25:04,960 --> 03:25:08,900
I will be eating my food, though, while we do this, so just
a heads up.

3254
03:25:10,520 --> 03:25:12,300
Just a heads up.

3255
03:25:13,680 --> 03:25:14,560
Let's go!

3256
03:25:18,350 --> 03:25:21,390
We're deleting all your files for being...

3257
03:25:21,390 --> 03:25:21,870
DD!

3258
03:25:22,610 --> 03:25:23,370
What do you mean?

3259
03:25:27,030 --> 03:25:28,030
Movie game.

3260
03:25:28,310 --> 03:25:29,090
Yeah, baby.

3261
03:25:29,410 --> 03:25:30,090
I can...

3262
03:25:31,290 --> 03:25:31,990
I don't know.

3263
03:25:31,990 --> 03:25:33,070
I can't eat and...

3264
03:25:43,780 --> 03:25:46,260
One of the three tacos contained a bomb.

3265
03:25:47,080 --> 03:25:48,860
I'll tank it.

3266
03:25:49,040 --> 03:25:54,920
Hey everybody, I appreciate you coming to see this.

3267
03:25:55,260 --> 03:25:56,300
Your support means a lot.

3268
03:25:56,580 --> 03:25:58,260
Can't believe you actually hung out with those fuckers.

3269
03:25:58,420 --> 03:25:59,380
You jealous, old man?

3270
03:25:59,640 --> 03:26:00,000
Of what?

3271
03:26:00,300 --> 03:26:00,700
Let me guess.

3272
03:26:00,940 --> 03:26:01,860
You get into a bar fight?

3273
03:26:02,240 --> 03:26:02,800
I'm right, right.

3274
03:26:03,060 --> 03:26:04,160
That's what criminals do at bars.

3275
03:26:04,320 --> 03:26:05,240
They ruin everybody's fun.

3276
03:26:05,800 --> 03:26:06,100
Fact.

3277
03:26:06,860 --> 03:26:09,560
If you're gonna make me stand next to a criminal, you could
have been- You missed 3 a.m.

3278
03:26:09,720 --> 03:26:10,120
Tacos.

3279
03:26:10,440 --> 03:26:12,020
You did not make me stand next to Benjamin's fucking butt.

3280
03:26:12,040 --> 03:26:20,900
and you could at least change his well what you miss was 3 a
.m tacos leading to 4 a.m heartburn followed by 5 a.m

3281
03:26:20,900 --> 03:26:30,920
diarrhea and to spread out chat it was lovely okay photo
post test 19 ready to open face sandwich to the taco

3282
03:26:30,920 --> 03:26:34,860
discussion is it engaging purpose now

3283
03:26:42,240 --> 03:26:45,360
are you guys having deep conversations without me

3284
03:26:52,610 --> 03:26:53,090
Salute!

3285
03:26:54,410 --> 03:26:57,850
Oh wow, you actually get to pick your like, your emote.

3286
03:27:02,130 --> 03:27:03,090
Metal gear.

3287
03:27:08,890 --> 03:27:09,370
Maybe.

3288
03:27:26,120 --> 03:27:27,260
Not bad, right?

3289
03:27:27,420 --> 03:27:28,220
So far so good.

3290
03:27:28,620 --> 03:27:30,980
The smoke is a little overkill.

3291
03:27:31,400 --> 03:27:34,840
I thought the same too, but I think the purple is a nice
touch.

3292
03:27:35,660 --> 03:27:36,900
What smoke?

3293
03:27:38,820 --> 03:27:39,880
Shut it down!

3294
03:27:41,080 --> 03:27:41,720
Oh!

3295
03:27:42,160 --> 03:27:44,280
Wait, it's not supposed to be there.

3296
03:27:44,600 --> 03:27:45,300
Oh my god.

3297
03:27:51,520 --> 03:27:52,480
Let's get him out.

3298
03:28:07,520 --> 03:28:08,680
Eject, eject!

3299
03:28:09,160 --> 03:28:09,680
Uh-oh.

3300
03:28:18,380 --> 03:28:20,000
So loud, oh my god.

3301
03:28:28,220 --> 03:28:30,100
Do I still have dispatch duty today?

3302
03:28:36,450 --> 03:28:38,590
You chose the wrong pose.

3303
03:28:42,330 --> 03:28:44,090
Yeah, can I go all in sick?

3304
03:28:46,430 --> 03:28:49,850
Is it disrespectful to eat this taco?

3305
03:28:57,800 --> 03:28:58,940
No, Rod!

3306
03:29:01,760 --> 03:29:03,500
How long was I out?

3307
03:29:04,260 --> 03:29:06,680
About 14, 15 hours, I think.

3308
03:29:07,880 --> 03:29:10,460
Imagine if he said 16, 17 hours.

3309
03:29:10,580 --> 03:29:11,600
Why would it look worse than me?

3310
03:29:13,640 --> 03:29:14,980
It's over, brother.

3311
03:29:15,500 --> 03:29:15,860
Oh!

3312
03:29:16,840 --> 03:29:19,120
I cannot recreate the Astral Pulse.

3313
03:29:19,720 --> 03:29:19,800
No.

3314
03:29:20,540 --> 03:29:21,800
Too much power.

3315
03:29:22,540 --> 03:29:23,520
Too small size.

3316
03:29:24,600 --> 03:29:25,460
It's in the dog.

3317
03:29:25,780 --> 03:29:27,380
I can't make the man Mecca.

3318
03:29:29,800 --> 03:29:30,780
I'm not good enough, bro.

3319
03:29:31,820 --> 03:29:32,380
Fail you.

3320
03:29:33,020 --> 03:29:33,740
I failed everybody.

3321
03:29:34,740 --> 03:29:35,780
Almost bring down the...

3322
03:29:35,780 --> 03:29:37,040
No, it's just a minor setback.

3323
03:29:37,580 --> 03:29:37,680
Almost get you.

3324
03:29:38,400 --> 03:29:39,760
Let's get everybody blown up.

3325
03:29:40,760 --> 03:29:45,080
All this is is just a minor setback.

3326
03:29:45,940 --> 03:29:46,580
I'm not worried.

3327
03:29:48,000 --> 03:30:04,700

anything else thank you oh

03:30:16,020 --> 03:30:21,580
I heard that big bastard crying in the bathroom makes it
hard to shit when somebody doing that next to you you know

3330
03:30:21,580 --> 03:30:31,280
pretty distracting yeah everyone else okay and busy girl

She's...

3335
03:30:51,280 --> 03:30:51,760
She's...

3336
03:30:51,760 --> 03:30:54,600
She's challenging, but we're up for a challenge.

3337
03:30:54,900 --> 03:30:59,820
She's challenging, which requires extra effort.

3338
03:31:01,220 --> 03:31:02,380
Seems like a lot of extra effort.

3339
03:31:04,220 --> 03:31:05,260
Yeah, I just said that.

3340
03:31:05,580 --> 03:31:06,220
So, I don't know.

3341
03:31:06,420 --> 03:31:07,820
Read that however you want.

3342
03:31:08,220 --> 03:31:09,920
Look, just be careful, kid.

3343
03:31:10,440 --> 03:31:11,840
Some people did black holes.

3344
03:31:12,400 --> 03:31:16,560
You reach out to help them, and they just suck you in and do
whatever the...

3345
03:31:16,560 --> 03:31:18,940
I don't think she's been so bad recently, though.

3346
03:31:20,320 --> 03:31:28,620
this kind of response she's been like cool new looks screams

Stick to the plan if they're red ring or enhanced proceed
with caution.

3351
03:31:57,300 --> 03:31:59,040
She's doing the job for me.

3352
03:31:59,180 --> 03:32:12,720
Oh my god You really gave us a scare Turns out I'm
completely fine Just sort of time traveled several hours

03:36:34,460 --> 03:36:35,940
I was on fire.

3398
03:36:36,160 --> 03:36:36,440
Yeah!

3399
03:36:39,330 --> 03:36:40,370
On water.

3400
03:36:40,590 --> 03:36:42,510
You were so good, waterboy.

3401
03:36:42,690 --> 03:36:43,630
You were so perfect.

3402
03:36:44,310 --> 03:36:44,670
Good boy.

3403
03:36:44,930 --> 03:36:47,050
Robert, some asshole keeps hacking to my notes app.

3404
03:36:47,190 --> 03:36:49,470
He's fucking with all my stand-up comedy material.

3405
03:36:50,490 --> 03:36:52,310
I think they have access to our secure servers.

3406
03:36:52,510 --> 03:36:53,210
Oh, that's not good.

3407
03:36:54,210 --> 03:36:54,550
We're hacking.

3408
03:36:58,510 --> 03:36:59,050
Okie dokie.

3409
03:37:00,710 --> 03:37:01,910
What is this?

3410
03:37:04,450 --> 03:37:05,170
Oh, okay.

3411
03:37:05,990 --> 03:37:06,870
Oh, scary.

3412
03:37:08,890 --> 03:37:09,650
We gotta loop them.

3413
03:37:12,910 --> 03:37:13,470
Oh, my God.

3414
03:37:14,710 --> 03:37:15,530
Small loop.

3415
03:37:15,830 --> 03:37:16,250
Small loop.

3416
03:37:17,230 --> 03:37:17,370
Oh.

3417
03:37:19,370 --> 03:37:20,470
I forgot that these...

3418
03:37:20,490 --> 03:37:22,430
Please take care of them.

3419
03:37:22,470 --> 03:37:23,830
Okay, we don't know that one.

3420
03:37:25,290 --> 03:37:25,830
Yeah.

3421
03:37:27,210 --> 03:37:27,810
Uh...

3422
03:37:27,810 --> 03:37:28,890
That scared me.

3423
03:37:29,770 --> 03:37:30,970
What is this?

3424
03:37:31,530 --> 03:37:32,910
Up, up, down.

3425
03:37:37,380 --> 03:37:38,940
Up, up, down.

3426
03:37:52,800 --> 03:37:54,980
Left, right, left.

3427
03:37:55,460 --> 03:37:56,460
Up, up, down.

3428
03:37:56,820 --> 03:37:58,220
Left, right, left.

3429
03:37:58,780 --> 03:37:59,900
Up, up, down.

3430
03:38:00,360 --> 03:38:01,520
Left, right, left.

3431
03:38:04,020 --> 03:38:04,820
Fuck yeah.

3432
03:38:07,860 --> 03:38:08,440
Yeah!

3433
03:38:11,920 --> 03:38:14,800
Syndica, welcome to VamboShift, thank you!

3434
03:38:15,160 --> 03:38:15,700
Hacked.

3435
03:38:16,100 --> 03:38:17,280
Get hacked, Bozo.

3436
03:38:17,640 --> 03:38:18,040
Hello?

3437
03:38:18,880 --> 03:38:21,020
Yes, it's that time of month again.

3438
03:38:21,740 --> 03:38:23,640
Send your finest over to clean my abode.

3439
03:38:23,760 --> 03:38:24,520
My abode.

3440
03:38:24,980 --> 03:38:25,860
Oh, Karen.

3441
03:38:27,800 --> 03:38:28,380
Why?

3442
03:38:31,940 --> 03:38:34,700
Why are all these, like, so bad?

3443
03:38:35,200 --> 03:38:36,820
Like, they're just...

3444
03:38:36,820 --> 03:38:38,300
Do players or hold down the portal?

3445
03:38:38,320 --> 03:38:39,700
She did the best she could.

3446
03:38:40,140 --> 03:38:41,160
Must be a bit rusty.

3447
03:38:41,360 --> 03:38:42,900
She's been away from the desk too long.

3448
03:38:43,140 --> 03:38:43,720
I thought this was a big...

3449
03:38:43,720 --> 03:38:45,960
Like, why are all these requests, like, not emergencies?

3450
03:38:46,200 --> 03:38:47,140
I just make it look easy.

3451
03:38:48,040 --> 03:38:48,880
Shit, Rabbit.

3452
03:38:49,400 --> 03:38:50,420
You're actually cool.

3453
03:38:50,500 --> 03:38:50,960
He's not.

3454
03:38:51,200 --> 03:38:53,420
He's just been gone all day, so it seems like he is.

3455
03:38:57,200 --> 03:38:58,430
Let's throw this into...

3456
03:39:06,380 --> 03:39:08,140
And then the last one, we'll do charisma.

3457
03:39:11,940 --> 03:39:13,700
There's some dude, Joseph from the Abba Man.

3458
03:39:15,860 --> 03:39:16,820
It's weird.

3459
03:39:17,180 --> 03:39:18,340
Can you make it stop?

3460
03:39:19,320 --> 03:39:22,020
That voice He's dressed like Phenomenon

3461
03:39:28,120 --> 03:39:36,620
They subscribe to SDN And you do what they tell you to It's
kind of crazy Alright, we're de-escalating a fight We're

3462
03:39:36,620 --> 03:39:47,200
taking down the Phenomenon The Phenomenon Phenomenon
Phenomenon fan It's so hard to say And we're escorting him

3463
03:39:47,200 --> 03:39:47,860
off the premise.

3464
03:39:48,040 --> 03:39:49,420
Okay, we're going to have Punch up here.

3465
03:39:49,800 --> 03:39:51,020
We're going to have Coupe here.

3466
03:39:51,460 --> 03:39:52,780
And they're going to do their little...

3467
03:39:53,240 --> 03:39:54,160
Sharp as my knife.

3468
03:39:54,320 --> 03:39:55,520
Awesome synergy thing.

3469
03:39:55,980 --> 03:39:58,380
Don't dress like the man if you can't fight like him.

3470
03:39:58,700 --> 03:39:59,500
I mean, I'm still thinking about that.

3471
03:39:59,500 --> 03:40:00,060
You know what's crazy?

3472
03:40:00,120 --> 03:40:01,860
I think about, like, how...

3473
03:40:02,500 --> 03:40:03,720
Oh, the tacos.

3474
03:40:04,380 --> 03:40:06,160
I'm so glad I went to go get a taco.

3475
03:40:06,700 --> 03:40:08,220
Yeah, I'm with the big guy on this one.

3476
03:40:08,400 --> 03:40:08,900
I think it was both.

3477
03:40:08,900 --> 03:40:11,120
They just can't stop talking about the tacos.

3478
03:40:14,380 --> 03:40:15,100
But, um...

3479
03:40:15,100 --> 03:40:15,780
Oh, yikes.

3480
03:40:15,860 --> 03:40:32,440
Oh, we made it Bad bitch, no stopping me Yes, queen Taco
stream Takeover But I think about sometimes how Like one of

3481
03:40:32,440 --> 03:40:42,520
the older Like guys that played Superman In the TV show And
how Like people really, back in the day Really thought, like

3482
03:40:42,520 --> 03:40:46,920
children were like That's actually Superman Like that's
There is no character.

3483
03:40:47,120 --> 03:40:48,840
Like, that man standing in front of me is Superman.

3484
03:40:49,180 --> 03:40:54,160
And so a kid once brought a gun to, like, a meet and greet
thing.

3485
03:40:54,320 --> 03:40:58,800
And was just like, so if I shot you right now, you would
deflect this bullet.

3486
03:40:59,320 --> 03:41:00,760
And the man is, like, sweating.

3487
03:41:01,020 --> 03:41:03,580
He's like, he's like, how'd you get this gun?

3488
03:41:03,840 --> 03:41:04,360
Oh, my God.

3489
03:41:05,920 --> 03:41:14,220
And, and, um, he had to be like, oh, yeah, but if it
deflects off of me, like, it might hit somebody else, and

3490
03:41:14,220 --> 03:41:15,840
then they will get hurt, you know?

3491
03:41:16,680 --> 03:41:20,560
Like, oh my gosh, so crazy.

3492
03:41:23,080 --> 03:41:29,720
Superman is, like, known as, like, a cursed role because of,
like, how everything.

3493
03:41:31,460 --> 03:41:33,040
Let's do Charisma and She's Smart.

3494
03:41:41,090 --> 03:41:41,890
George Reeves.

3495
03:41:43,150 --> 03:41:44,090
Why did the kid have a gun?

3496
03:41:44,130 --> 03:41:45,090
That's a great question.

3497
03:41:46,830 --> 03:41:48,010
Oh, we 100% are.

3498
03:41:48,030 --> 03:41:49,030
Oh, probably because of the synergy.

3499
03:41:49,050 --> 03:41:50,390
Max Synergy!

3500
03:41:51,350 --> 03:41:51,510
Reached!

3501
03:41:52,230 --> 03:41:54,090
Reached Max Synergy with a hero duo.

3502
03:41:54,550 --> 03:41:55,210
Let's go!

3503
03:41:58,190 --> 03:41:59,130
Let's see.

3504
03:41:59,850 --> 03:42:01,150
You're getting an upgrade, huh?

3505
03:42:01,410 --> 03:42:03,050
Um, we'll give you...

3506
03:42:04,550 --> 03:42:04,910
Hmm.

3507
03:42:05,610 --> 03:42:06,430
More intellect.

3508
03:42:07,930 --> 03:42:09,090
Make her smarter.

3509
03:42:10,850 --> 03:42:15,930
No one believes me, but there's definitely a ghost in my
house.

3510
03:42:16,290 --> 03:42:18,550
Anybody over there good at exorcisms?

3511
03:42:19,050 --> 03:42:19,870
Or whatever.

3512
03:42:20,510 --> 03:42:21,030
Me?

3513
03:42:21,410 --> 03:42:22,790
I'm in the game!

3514
03:42:24,690 --> 03:42:25,610
It's me!

3515
03:42:26,850 --> 03:42:28,150
Investigate the house.

3516
03:42:30,210 --> 03:42:32,390
Reassure the owner that...

3517
03:42:32,390 --> 03:42:34,130
Um, let's see.

3518
03:42:34,710 --> 03:42:37,910
We'll do Waterboy, and we need someone with charisma.

3519
03:42:38,470 --> 03:42:41,410
So, this might be overkill, actually.

3520
03:42:42,190 --> 03:42:42,550
Ah, whatever.

3521
03:42:42,810 --> 03:42:42,970
It's fine.

3522
03:42:43,510 --> 03:42:44,690
Maybe I should have done Gollum.

3523
03:42:45,870 --> 03:42:48,770
Re-election's coming up, and we're hosting a little roast of
the mayor.

3524
03:42:49,050 --> 03:42:50,150
Are you trying to talk into the ghost?

3525
03:42:50,170 --> 03:42:52,290
SDN Hero would really round out our guest list.

3526
03:42:54,890 --> 03:42:56,570
They're gonna exercise you, get out of there?

3527
03:42:56,650 --> 03:42:58,390
No, because that's against the chat rules.

3528
03:43:01,890 --> 03:43:02,930
They couldn't ever.

3529
03:43:04,010 --> 03:43:05,730
It says roast but be smart.

3530
03:43:06,370 --> 03:43:10,370
Uh oh, did I entertain and be smart?

3531
03:43:12,970 --> 03:43:14,150
Okay, hold on, what's this one?

3532
03:43:14,330 --> 03:43:16,310
There's a full-on gang war happening at the warehouse.

3533
03:43:16,450 --> 03:43:16,830
Oh dang.

3534
03:43:17,070 --> 03:43:18,390
Looks like Red Ring in the Frigos.

3535
03:43:19,470 --> 03:43:21,770
The red ring is closing in on this biker gang.

3536
03:43:21,890 --> 03:43:23,170
Oh, that's actually the Frigos.

3537
03:43:23,550 --> 03:43:24,490
They're an e-biker gang.

3538
03:43:24,730 --> 03:43:25,390
Way worse.

3539
03:43:37,150 --> 03:43:39,130
Enhanced durability red ring lieutenant.

3540
03:43:43,410 --> 03:43:44,690
Stop the gang.

3541
03:43:47,250 --> 03:43:48,410
Oh, no, I don't reach it.

3542
03:43:48,890 --> 03:43:49,590
Okay, we need...

3543
03:43:49,590 --> 03:43:50,430
Okay, who's smarter?

3544
03:43:50,730 --> 03:43:51,310
Okay, fine.

3545
03:43:51,390 --> 03:43:53,190
I think Invisagal is not smarter.

3546
03:43:53,350 --> 03:43:53,910
All right, all right.

3547
03:43:54,870 --> 03:43:55,830
No, they're the same.

3548
03:43:57,970 --> 03:44:11,570

3549
03:44:11,570 --> 03:44:18,070

helping people is kind of nice for whatever this is when you

3550
03:44:18,070 --> 03:44:27,850

actually have this thing and his wife got the balls Oh,

3551
03:44:28,010 --> 03:44:28,070
dang.

3552
03:44:29,510 --> 03:44:33,010
I was beginning to believe Anders Tank's wife lacked both
taste and sense.

3553
03:44:33,410 --> 03:44:38,890
I knew the vibes were off this morning, but I couldn't tell
if it was divorce vibes or shitty commute traffic vibe.

3554
03:44:39,210 --> 03:44:41,510
Hey, maybe she's not going to hell after all.

3555
03:44:41,770 --> 03:44:44,010
Marrying someone can send you to hell.

3556
03:44:44,450 --> 03:44:44,810
Oh, no.

3557
03:44:44,810 --> 03:44:47,810
We needed to bring Malevila because she's a demon.

3558
03:44:48,950 --> 03:44:49,990
Let's investigate.

3559
03:44:51,130 --> 03:44:53,390
Wait, the homeowner says she can hear things from her
basement.

3560
03:44:53,670 --> 03:44:54,090
Voices.

3561
03:44:56,610 --> 03:44:56,990
Yeah.

3562
03:44:57,090 --> 03:44:57,530
We have another hour.

3563
03:45:02,740 --> 03:45:04,640
Investigate the pipes.

3564
03:45:12,110 --> 03:45:12,950
Uh-oh.

3565
03:45:13,710 --> 03:45:15,430
Oh, okay.

3566
03:45:15,830 --> 03:45:16,690
That was not great.

3567
03:45:17,110 --> 03:45:19,930
But I am sure I can turn this around.

3568
03:45:20,310 --> 03:45:21,050
Oopsie.

3569
03:45:24,350 --> 03:45:29,190
The faction of light needs your help to overtake the faction
of darkness.

3570
03:45:30,470 --> 03:45:33,430
Preferably before eight when the park closes.

3571
03:45:34,990 --> 03:45:35,390
LARP.

3572
03:45:35,470 --> 03:45:36,730
It stands for live action.

3573
03:45:36,750 --> 03:45:38,410
You don't know what a LARP is?

3574
03:45:38,430 --> 03:45:40,510
It's not a sex thing.

3575
03:45:40,910 --> 03:45:43,670
Okay, it's like people dressing up and playing pretend type
shit.

3576
03:45:43,830 --> 03:45:45,110
The ghost swan cannon ending.

3577
03:45:45,230 --> 03:45:45,970
So real.

3578
03:45:49,770 --> 03:45:50,770
Everyone's busy, though.

3579
03:45:53,610 --> 03:45:54,150
They can wait.

3580
03:45:54,770 --> 03:45:56,450
It's not very, it's not going very fast.

3581
03:46:00,880 --> 03:46:03,580
I'm almost done with this, by the way, guys, so you don't
have to listen to me.

3582
03:46:03,800 --> 03:46:04,200
No!

3583
03:46:05,460 --> 03:46:19,900
Crunch, crunch, and so much man i thought we had it man i

the profile picture I drew the one that was for everybody I

3587
03:46:57,420 --> 03:47:03,360
was thinking the other day I was like wow I haven't seen
anybody using it that's so sad so thank you

3588
03:47:10,050 --> 03:47:16,010
I never posted it it was supposed to be you screenshot it
and then you get it That's how it's, that's how I've been

3589
03:47:16,010 --> 03:47:16,570
doing them.

3590
03:47:19,950 --> 03:47:20,810
There's been people using it.

3591
03:47:20,970 --> 03:47:21,670
There have been.

3592
03:47:23,530 --> 03:47:23,890
Yay.

3593
03:47:28,960 --> 03:47:29,520
Um.

3594
03:47:33,680 --> 03:47:33,960
Okay.

3595
03:47:34,560 --> 03:47:35,340
I'm focused.

3596
03:47:40,580 --> 03:47:41,000
What am I?

3597
03:47:41,140 --> 03:47:42,160
What kind of...

3598
03:47:52,040 --> 03:47:55,080
I think maybe more vigor.

3599
03:47:57,080 --> 03:47:57,480
No.

3600
03:47:57,940 --> 03:47:58,080
I don't know.

3601
03:47:58,100 --> 03:47:59,060
We're already on these...

3602
03:47:59,060 --> 03:48:00,340
High on these ones.

3603
03:48:01,900 --> 03:48:03,340
Opposite of water, boy.

3604
03:48:05,420 --> 03:48:07,220
Who do you pair her with?

3605
03:48:07,360 --> 03:48:07,700
I don't...

3606
03:48:07,700 --> 03:48:11,100
I think she goes with the bat guy, so...

3607
03:48:15,490 --> 03:48:17,930
If I change my profile pick, how will you recognize me?

3608
03:48:17,990 --> 03:48:18,830
That's so true, though.

3609
03:48:18,970 --> 03:48:20,110
It's hard for me to.

3610
03:48:21,750 --> 03:48:23,570
She goes with water boy now?

3611
03:48:24,150 --> 03:48:26,330
Okay, so she needs more...

3612
03:48:27,050 --> 03:48:28,450
Then we'll go with combat.

3613
03:48:29,830 --> 03:48:30,310
Okay.

3614
03:48:30,330 --> 03:48:31,190
Yeah.

3615
03:48:33,150 --> 03:48:33,910
Oh, okay.

3616
03:48:34,170 --> 03:48:34,590
That was good.

3617
03:48:34,910 --> 03:48:35,590
Uh, what is this?

3618
03:48:36,190 --> 03:48:38,030
Mr. Van der Stank is requesting assistance.

3619
03:48:38,290 --> 03:48:41,950
His line of delivery bots appear to have gained sentience
and are attacking the city.

3620
03:48:43,090 --> 03:48:45,250
This guy has always gotten into something.

3621
03:48:47,470 --> 03:48:49,150
Before they reach Vanco.

3622
03:48:52,530 --> 03:48:53,230
Mm-hmm.

3623
03:48:53,510 --> 03:48:54,230
Where is that?

3624
03:48:56,170 --> 03:48:57,330
It's down here, right?

3625
03:48:57,790 --> 03:48:57,990
Oh.

3626
03:48:59,790 --> 03:49:00,310
Oh.

3627
03:49:00,330 --> 03:49:00,810
Oh shoot.

3628
03:49:01,750 --> 03:49:01,930
Ah!

3629
03:49:05,670 --> 03:49:06,150
Um...

3630
03:49:07,030 --> 03:49:07,510
Uh...

3631
03:49:07,510 --> 03:49:08,210
Screw it.

3632
03:49:08,350 --> 03:49:11,530
We'll do the both of them.

3633
03:49:11,630 --> 03:49:13,470
Me old doctor used to be over here.

3634
03:49:14,130 --> 03:49:15,730
Technically he's a veterinarian.

3635
03:49:15,930 --> 03:49:16,030
Okay.

3636
03:49:16,030 --> 03:49:16,550
Uh, role play.

3637
03:49:16,570 --> 03:49:19,370
I got the physiognomy of a pygmy hippo, so we made a fine
pair.

3638
03:49:19,630 --> 03:49:20,270
Robbery downtown.

3639
03:49:20,750 --> 03:49:24,550
Suspect is in pursuit, but we need SDN to defrost the bank.

3640
03:49:25,030 --> 03:49:25,990
Defrost the bank?

3641
03:49:26,110 --> 03:49:26,670
Okay, hold on.

3642
03:49:27,370 --> 03:49:27,850

Alright, and then we need to defrost.

Oh, okay.

3648
03:50:19,360 --> 03:50:19,980
I think we're safe.

3649
03:50:20,300 --> 03:50:20,300
Yeah.

3650
03:50:20,980 --> 03:50:20,980
Nice.

3651
03:50:21,960 --> 03:50:22,840
Not too shabby.

3652
03:50:23,420 --> 03:50:24,440
Not too shabby at all.

3653
03:50:24,780 --> 03:50:24,780
Okay.

3654
03:50:25,580 --> 03:50:26,300
Now what is this?

3655
03:50:26,380 --> 03:50:27,160
Break the ice.

3656
03:50:27,360 --> 03:50:28,260
Oh my gosh, another thing.

3657
03:50:29,040 --> 03:50:30,820
The LARP has gone wrong!

3658
03:50:32,660 --> 03:50:33,980
Choose a class.

03:50:34,180 --> 03:50:35,660
A bard, because prism.

Okay.

Okay, indeed.

3672
03:51:30,300 --> 03:51:30,640
All right.

3673
03:51:31,480 --> 03:51:31,740
All right.

3674
03:51:32,240 --> 03:51:34,080
As soon as I click out of this, I click.

3675
03:51:34,240 --> 03:51:34,680
Okay.

3676
03:51:35,740 --> 03:51:36,480
Yeah, okay.

3677
03:51:37,120 --> 03:51:38,480
Somebody's about to get burned.

3678
03:51:38,760 --> 03:51:41,200
Oh, okay, uh, and it's not the meme.

3679
03:51:43,260 --> 03:51:47,100
Uncertified forklift driver dropped an entire shipment in
the harbor.

3680
03:51:47,440 --> 03:51:50,880
Recover what you can before it becomes waterlogged.

3681
03:51:51,900 --> 03:51:53,460
That doesn't sound so great.

3682
03:51:58,260 --> 03:51:59,020
Maybe...

3683
03:51:59,020 --> 03:51:59,900
Invisigal?

3684
03:52:00,020 --> 03:52:00,480
Oh, sure.

3685
03:52:04,180 --> 03:52:04,940
And...

3686
03:52:04,940 --> 03:52:06,240
Uncertified.

3687
03:52:06,500 --> 03:52:07,880
No way.

3688
03:52:11,780 --> 03:52:14,320
No, you're an uncertified hamster!

3689
03:52:15,560 --> 03:52:17,420
You can't be uncertified for it!

3690
03:52:17,440 --> 03:52:18,980
The forklift driver, too!

3691
03:52:20,340 --> 03:52:22,100
Waterlogged, yeah, but Waterboy is...

3692
03:52:22,100 --> 03:52:22,960
He's resting.

3693
03:52:23,480 --> 03:52:24,540
I don't know if we'll make it in time.

3694
03:52:24,700 --> 03:52:28,540
Listen, it would bring your kid to work day, and I thought
he could try using the forklift.

3695
03:52:30,100 --> 03:52:31,080
We'll do them both.

3696
03:52:31,880 --> 03:52:32,500
We'll do them both.

3697
03:52:33,840 --> 03:52:35,560
I have a lot of people, so I can send them...

3698
03:52:35,560 --> 03:52:36,140
Oh my god.

3699
03:52:36,280 --> 03:52:37,740
This looks like a job for a janitor.

3700
03:52:38,140 --> 03:52:40,040
Let me squeeze on in here.

3701
03:52:42,000 --> 03:52:44,380
Catch up to the retreating delivery bots.

3702
03:52:45,140 --> 03:52:46,820
Reprogram them not to attack humans.

3703
03:52:47,440 --> 03:52:50,220
while keeping their sentiancy.

3704
03:52:51,080 --> 03:52:51,820
Oh, shit.

3705
03:52:52,260 --> 03:52:53,080
Maybe I should have sent...

3706
03:52:56,280 --> 03:52:56,680
Wait.

3707
03:52:58,520 --> 03:52:58,920
Coupe!

3708
03:52:59,480 --> 03:52:59,480
Coupe!

3709
03:53:00,020 --> 03:53:00,960
Coupe can do it.

3710
03:53:02,760 --> 03:53:03,860
She can do it.

3711
03:53:04,580 --> 03:53:04,900
I believe.

3712
03:53:05,040 --> 03:53:05,620
Close your eyes.

3713
03:53:06,440 --> 03:53:07,920
You're not gonna like what you see anyway.

3714
03:53:08,160 --> 03:53:08,400
Alright.

3715
03:53:10,600 --> 03:53:11,780
Too much Faito in the team.

3716
03:53:11,880 --> 03:53:12,300
No, no, no.

3717
03:53:12,420 --> 03:53:12,700
We're okay.

3718
03:53:12,880 --> 03:53:13,160
We're okay.

3719
03:53:14,800 --> 03:53:15,220
We're okay.

3720
03:53:15,380 --> 03:53:15,720
We're okay.

3721
03:53:17,460 --> 03:53:17,900
X.

3722
03:53:18,120 --> 03:53:18,700
No, she didn't.

3723
03:53:18,800 --> 03:53:19,440
It didn't bounce.

3724
03:53:19,580 --> 03:53:20,560
I didn't see it bounce.

3725
03:53:22,560 --> 03:53:23,300
That's why...

3726
03:53:23,300 --> 03:53:24,300
Wait, did it bounce?

3727
03:53:27,680 --> 03:53:28,960
I didn't see it.

3728
03:53:38,930 --> 03:53:39,810
It didn't.

3729
03:53:40,130 --> 03:53:41,130
Like, you guys are...

3730
03:53:41,130 --> 03:53:42,510
You guys are scaring me.

3731
03:53:46,370 --> 03:53:47,990
I have no one that's smart.

3732
03:53:52,180 --> 03:53:52,720
One guide.

3733
03:53:52,800 --> 03:53:54,120
I definitely wasn't a one guide.

3734
03:53:54,260 --> 03:53:55,840
It was definitely... Yeah, 50 guide.

3735
03:53:55,960 --> 03:53:58,240
Yeah, a ton of people were saying I I hit it.

3736
03:54:00,120 --> 03:54:02,800
A ton of people were saying I hit it.

3737
03:54:03,840 --> 03:54:06,520
Let's send the girlies out.

3738
03:54:09,020 --> 03:54:11,240
I thought you said you had it.

3739
03:54:11,560 --> 03:54:12,640
No, no, that was me.

3740
03:54:12,740 --> 03:54:13,900
Do I look different?

3741
03:54:14,920 --> 03:54:15,600
Come on!

3742
03:54:16,080 --> 03:54:19,480
Well, I'll be drawing yours on Sunday with the...

3743
03:54:19,480 --> 03:54:20,740
I bought the booze.

3744
03:54:20,880 --> 03:54:22,080
Folks down for a carpool?

3745
03:54:22,700 --> 03:54:23,160
I got rude.

3746
03:54:23,980 --> 03:54:25,700
I would like a ride.

3747
03:54:26,220 --> 03:54:28,120
I'll bring extra towels.

3748
03:54:29,480 --> 03:54:29,960
Happy!

3749
03:54:30,480 --> 03:54:31,140
Thank you!

3750
03:54:33,340 --> 03:54:35,520
You caught the edge but it didn't bounce.

3751
03:54:36,400 --> 03:54:37,600
That's what I thought.

3752
03:54:39,080 --> 03:54:39,900
Hero training.

3753
03:54:42,040 --> 03:54:42,920
Oh, let's do punch-up.

3754
03:54:43,080 --> 03:54:45,360
Hey team, Blazer's doing a speech over the college.

3755
03:54:46,060 --> 03:54:48,580
And one of you will be there to hear it.

3756
03:54:49,700 --> 03:54:49,980
Oh.

3757
03:54:51,220 --> 03:54:51,700
No?

3758
03:54:52,000 --> 03:54:52,960
Why is it X'd out?

3759
03:54:55,240 --> 03:54:56,380
Oh, maybe not.

3760
03:54:56,520 --> 03:54:57,680
Maybe nobody will hear it.

3761
03:54:58,040 --> 03:54:58,520
Wait.

3762
03:55:04,960 --> 03:55:06,860
huh that's funky

3763
03:55:10,240 --> 03:55:23,860
you haven't unlocked his og skill seriously oh my god i
can't even send him out uh let's do combat let's do more

3764
03:55:23,860 --> 03:55:34,040
combat he's tough guy and then for you we'll do more This is
slightly tricky, is it?

3765
03:55:34,760 --> 03:55:35,500
That's okay.

3766
03:55:39,000 --> 03:55:40,000
Let's do...

3767
03:55:41,100 --> 03:55:42,100
Not intelligence.

3768
03:55:42,780 --> 03:55:43,800
We'll do...

3769
03:55:44,460 --> 03:55:45,960
Oh yeah, I said I would do more charisma.

3770
03:55:47,260 --> 03:55:47,440
Yeah.

3771
03:55:49,840 --> 03:55:51,000
Let's see how this went.

3772
03:55:51,140 --> 03:55:51,640
I'm scared.

3773
03:55:54,900 --> 03:55:56,080
Oh, it did bounce!

3774
03:55:57,460 --> 03:55:57,880
No!

3775
03:56:01,110 --> 03:56:01,590
Wait!

3776
03:56:02,570 --> 03:56:03,330
It went...

3777
03:56:03,330 --> 03:56:03,790
Wait!

3778
03:56:09,030 --> 03:56:09,230
What?

3779
03:56:09,470 --> 03:56:10,370
No, okay, though.

3780
03:56:12,270 --> 03:56:14,090
Is it because Kubei was in the first slot?

3781
03:56:14,310 --> 03:56:15,010
I think...

3782
03:56:15,010 --> 03:56:16,630
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

3783
03:56:18,270 --> 03:56:19,710
It didn't say it before.

3784
03:56:19,850 --> 03:56:20,770
It really didn't.

3785
03:56:20,910 --> 03:56:21,830
It didn't, though.

3786
03:56:23,190 --> 03:56:25,290
Is it because I put her in slot one?

3787
03:56:26,310 --> 03:56:29,270
I needed to put her in the other slot so that it...

3788
03:56:29,270 --> 03:56:30,210
Because I think...

3789
03:56:30,210 --> 03:56:31,450
I think what happened is...

3790
03:56:33,430 --> 03:56:34,330
Is, uh...

3791
03:56:37,290 --> 03:56:42,810
no though okay maybe it did the first time and i didn't
notice because when i put her in the second time it

3792
03:56:42,810 --> 03:56:48,330
definitely did not i looked we need to rewind the blood

3793
03:56:51,750 --> 03:57:00,030
i think that it didn't account for the boost in her combat i
think when putting her in the first slot i think that's what

3794
03:57:00,030 --> 03:57:00,610
it was

3795
03:57:04,410 --> 03:57:14,530
the buff after the fact yeah i think that's what it was um
oh well

3796
03:57:17,890 --> 03:57:29,570
disrupted oh yeah baby i really did look for it the second
time though when i re-put her back in there i really didn't

3797
03:57:29,570 --> 03:57:35,310
see it um there's an entire race of mole people.

3798
03:57:39,100 --> 03:57:40,500
If we... Kindness is charisma.

3799
03:57:40,680 --> 03:57:41,400
We got this.

3800
03:57:42,880 --> 03:57:43,820
The mole people.

3801
03:57:55,650 --> 03:57:56,130
Let's see.

3802
03:57:57,490 --> 03:57:59,250
I clicked it!

3803
03:58:00,650 --> 03:58:01,670
I'm not...

3804
03:58:01,670 --> 03:58:04,530
I mean, it's not because we're...

3805
03:58:04,530 --> 03:58:05,110
Dang.

3806
03:58:05,250 --> 03:58:06,630
I tried to click it to get the...

3807
03:58:08,750 --> 03:58:09,350
No!

3808
03:58:09,670 --> 03:58:09,990
Oh well.

3809
03:58:11,030 --> 03:58:12,950
I maxed my career rank.

3810
03:58:13,050 --> 03:58:13,630
Let's go!

3811
03:58:14,170 --> 03:58:15,450
Bring back a hero from downed.

3812
03:58:15,570 --> 03:58:17,970
I don't think I've ever had someone downed before though.

3813
03:58:21,230 --> 03:58:22,370
I think I'm too good.

3814
03:58:25,290 --> 03:58:26,330
Mobility too?

3815
03:58:30,420 --> 03:58:30,940
Cool pay.

3816
03:58:34,640 --> 03:58:35,100
Yippee!

3817
03:58:42,400 --> 03:58:44,760
Flambé has a really bad skill for a second one.

3818
03:58:45,860 --> 03:58:49,580
choose two are they both bad ouch

3819
03:58:57,000 --> 03:59:07,360
ouch i mean you know it feels like for the first time in a
long time i can see a life without mecha man which i'm sure

3820
03:59:07,360 --> 03:59:16,280
you would appreciate been nice that we get to spend more
time together so hard right teaching people to be heroes

3821
03:59:16,280 --> 03:59:26,880
guiding them it's not nothing but i don't think i can sit on
the sideline I worked hard to get good at being mecha man

3822
03:59:28,220 --> 03:59:31,680
incomprehensible I don't know that I want to just walk away
from that

3823
03:59:35,020 --> 03:59:35,940
Thank you, Russ.

3824
03:59:36,080 --> 03:59:40,440
Just when I feel like I got a handle on it Got it figured
out.

3825
03:59:40,560 --> 03:59:49,580
I think about chase And my dad and shroud Then I get all
fucked up You know what I'm saying, beef?

3826
03:59:50,300 --> 03:59:53,860
You know what I mean Yeah Oh.

3827
03:59:55,400 --> 03:59:56,360
Yeah, exactly.

3828
03:59:56,660 --> 03:59:58,580
See, this is why I appreciate it.

3829
03:59:58,960 --> 03:59:59,320
That's a chihuahua.

3830
04:00:00,900 --> 04:00:02,100
That's so concerning.

3831
04:00:07,470 --> 04:00:08,950
This doesn't seem so good.

3832
04:00:10,450 --> 04:00:10,770
Oh, hello.

3833
04:00:13,250 --> 04:00:13,910
Are you decent?

3834
04:00:14,710 --> 04:00:16,170
Definitely a house that needs some warmth.

3835
04:00:16,850 --> 04:00:18,210
I'm in my underwear.

3836
04:00:19,090 --> 04:00:19,750
Somehow the worse.

3837
04:00:20,330 --> 04:00:21,550
I am in my underwear.

3838
04:00:22,930 --> 04:00:23,810
I can see you.

3839
04:00:24,170 --> 04:00:25,770
I was joking when I asked if you're decent.

3840
04:00:25,890 --> 04:00:31,990
I know I just need you to know that I know how I look right
now All right, that rubs out by the way.

3841
04:00:32,150 --> 04:00:35,870
You just have to put a little muscle into it Do you know why
you want to hang this?

3842
04:00:36,410 --> 04:00:37,330
Why are you holding a lamp?

3843
04:00:37,550 --> 04:00:43,870
I think he's only considered where he'd hang himself That
corner seems fine It's a housewarming gift for your

3844
04:00:43,870 --> 04:00:53,110
housewarming party Housewarming party Wait, wait people more

before then Vizia asked me to get this morning and

3848
04:01:21,250 --> 04:01:28,410
cross-reference with recent calls wait wait wait wait it's
not and a bunch of B-grade villains have been trying to

3849
04:01:28,410 --> 04:01:32,270
unlock its power only to end up blowing their asses off like
you did.

3850
04:01:32,950 --> 04:01:34,430
Then they sell it on the next sucker.

3851
04:01:34,750 --> 04:01:35,710
They're just doxing me!

3852
04:01:36,050 --> 04:01:38,070
The past hand at least four times that we've tracked.

3853
04:01:38,330 --> 04:01:39,710
How does Shroud not know this?

3854
04:01:39,830 --> 04:01:40,950
Yeah, probably think like us.

3855
04:01:40,970 --> 04:01:44,090
I can't believe they're like, you actually made the
incorrect choice.

3856
04:01:44,350 --> 04:01:45,330
You don't small fuck up, man.

3857
04:01:45,370 --> 04:01:46,490
You're gonna figure it out soon enough.

3858
04:01:46,850 --> 04:01:49,070
You actually did not make the right choice because...

3859
04:01:49,870 --> 04:01:53,430
The Z-teamers know every low-level supervillain in three
counties.

3860
04:01:53,930 --> 04:01:54,970
We track its location.

3861
04:01:55,970 --> 04:02:02,670
then we kick in some doors knock some heads snatch that shit
back and you'll be are we sure this will work in that time

3862
04:02:02,670 --> 04:02:09,370
and you're sure that this will work I've had about as much
heartbreak as I could take today no clue it's not like you

3863
04:02:09,370 --> 04:02:15,350
got anything better to do you make a compelling argument I
have a team to dispatch things that we got was from a boat

3864
04:02:15,350 --> 04:02:22,510
over here in Marina de Rey which is oh Yoni territory why
she's here first you know much about those guys thank you

3865
04:02:22,510 --> 04:02:22,890
Oh, my goodness.

3866
04:02:23,630 --> 04:02:24,810
Ask what we're in coke heads.

3867
04:02:25,310 --> 04:02:26,310
Skylaw, Katie runs it now.

3868
04:02:26,670 --> 04:02:28,570
Three generations that family's been trying to think of me.

3869
04:02:28,930 --> 04:02:30,230
What are they accusing you of?

3870
04:02:30,890 --> 04:02:31,430
You're cute.

3871
04:02:32,330 --> 04:02:35,150
We're gonna ask you some questions about a piece of peck
they moved.

3872
04:02:36,050 --> 04:02:37,550
But first, Rob gotta put on pants.

3874
04:02:38,530 --> 04:02:39,510

3875
04:02:40,130 --> 04:02:40,590

3876
04:02:45,470 --> 04:02:46,910

04:02:49,670 --> 04:02:54,010

Oh wait, no.

3879
04:02:56,510 --> 04:02:57,310
I turned it off.

3880
04:02:57,530 --> 04:02:58,950
I shouldn't get flagged for anything, right?

3881
04:03:15,650 --> 04:03:16,630
It's my girlfriend.

3882
04:03:16,770 --> 04:03:17,330
Wait, wait.

3883
04:03:17,590 --> 04:03:19,150
Isn't tonight my day with my girlfriend?

3884
04:03:19,870 --> 04:03:20,710
Everybody get out!

3885
04:03:23,050 --> 04:03:23,570

Are you okay, Waterboy?

3893
04:03:47,270 --> 04:03:49,030
She was talking about the...

3894
04:03:50,010 --> 04:03:51,550
She was talking about this?

3895
04:03:52,190 --> 04:03:53,010
Is she gonna come over?

3896
04:03:53,310 --> 04:03:53,550

3897
04:04:06,320 --> 04:04:07,920

You do understand how projectors work.

3903
04:05:18,150 --> 04:05:19,470
She's just drawing that on the wall.

3904
04:05:20,730 --> 04:05:22,670
And bare walls are a sign of depression.

3905
04:05:23,410 --> 04:05:25,090
Why isn't always a warehouse by the box?

3906
04:05:25,110 --> 04:05:25,730
I have many walls.

3907
04:05:26,010 --> 04:05:27,470
It's where stuff comes in and stuff goes out.

3908
04:05:27,590 --> 04:05:28,330
I guess I'm not depressed.

3909
04:05:28,550 --> 04:05:29,650
You're a rocket scientist, are ya?

3910
04:05:30,010 --> 04:05:30,390

04:07:54,590 --> 04:07:55,330
I'm sorry.

3941
04:07:55,550 --> 04:07:58,310
This turned into whatever just happened.

3942
04:08:00,610 --> 04:08:04,690
Anyone who utters one word about what happened tonight

3951
04:09:17,330 --> 04:09:18,130
His blood pressure.

3952
04:09:19,210 --> 04:09:21,490
I was the one who suggested the ridicule.

3953
04:09:21,730 --> 04:09:22,610
You sure this ain't Baku.

3954
04:09:24,590 --> 04:09:25,570

3955
04:09:26,090 --> 04:09:27,290
Made quite a first impression.

3956
04:09:27,830 --> 04:09:29,890
Be no, be no!

3957
04:09:30,390 --> 04:09:31,130
Kinky shit.

3958
04:09:31,410 --> 04:09:33,350
It's that internet somehow made sex boring.

3959
04:09:33,630 --> 04:09:35,370
Okay, now you sound how you look.

3960
04:09:36,310 --> 04:09:37,590
Another thing I can't do anymore.

Fuck.

3962
04:09:39,110 --> 04:09:40,830
Maybe it's why I say the word so much.

3963
04:09:41,150 --> 04:09:41,450
Uh.

3964
04:09:41,830 --> 04:09:54,650

people put it all on the line for someone who won't ever
know your name it's the right thing to do it's just the

3966
04:10:04,210 --> 04:10:13,570

to tell the difference that first week Busy?

3967
04:10:14,810 --> 04:10:15,810
I was gonna walk off the team.

3968
04:10:17,110 --> 04:10:18,190
You know, she's feeling low.

3969
04:10:19,410 --> 04:10:24,450
Talking about how she was born with powers that always meant
she'd end up as a villain.

3970
04:10:24,570 --> 04:10:25,390
I don't understand.

3971
04:10:26,530 --> 04:10:27,830
Like he was fated.

3972
04:10:29,450 --> 04:10:32,030
Like, invisibility is like the most common superpower.

3973
04:10:33,070 --> 04:10:36,050
Why would you be like, I got the bad pick of invisibility?

3974
04:10:36,830 --> 04:10:37,190
Yada, yada.

3975
04:10:37,770 --> 04:10:39,430
That means I have to be a villain.

3976
04:10:39,690 --> 04:10:40,650
I do remember thinking.

3977
04:10:40,750 --> 04:10:40,990

04:14:39,730 --> 04:14:41,070
That was cool!

4034
04:14:41,830 --> 04:14:42,650
What the fuck?

4035
04:14:46,500 --> 04:14:46,940
Smashed.

4036
04:14:48,860 --> 04:14:49,300
Flattened.

4037
04:14:49,320 --> 04:14:50,640

Okay, hey, busy.

04:14:52,440 --> 04:14:53,980
Lead him towards that speaker tower.

04:14:54,220 --> 04:14:54,800
I've got an idea.

4041
04:14:55,780 --> 04:14:59,060
One, but a good one.

4042
04:14:59,620 --> 04:15:00,320
Oh my gosh, okay.

04:15:02,280 --> 04:15:03,160

Okay, um...

Oh.

04:16:29,340 --> 04:16:30,040
Left, left, left, right.

4066
04:16:30,360 --> 04:16:30,380
Ah!

Oh, wait.

4071
04:16:38,000 --> 04:16:38,920

4072
04:16:39,560 --> 04:16:39,720

04:16:43,840 --> 04:16:43,840
Ah!

4078
04:16:44,300 --> 04:16:44,520
Ah!

4079
04:16:44,620 --> 04:16:44,620
Ah!

4080
04:16:44,960 --> 04:16:45,140

4082
04:16:45,240 --> 04:16:45,620
Ah!

4083
04:16:45,620 --> 04:16:45,640
Ah!

4084
04:16:45,720 --> 04:16:46,040
Sorry.

4085
04:16:46,800 --> 04:16:47,840
It's scary for you.

4086
04:16:48,840 --> 04:16:51,540
Oh my god, I don't think I'm gonna make it, you guys!

4087
04:16:55,920 --> 04:16:58,120
Okay, I'll kill this guy if he comes to me.

4088
04:16:58,800 --> 04:16:59,080
Yeah.

4089
04:16:59,600 --> 04:17:00,220
What was I doing?

4090
04:17:00,780 --> 04:17:02,900
Oh, uh, left, left, left, right.

4091
04:17:03,220 --> 04:17:03,600
There we go.

4092
04:17:03,640 --> 04:17:04,540
Now the crane.

4093
04:17:05,700 --> 04:17:06,660
So scary.

4094
04:17:08,880 --> 04:17:09,420
Heads up.

4095
04:17:09,580 --> 04:17:10,060
Lights here.

4096
04:17:11,580 --> 04:17:11,840
Whoa!

4097
04:17:13,580 --> 04:17:14,060
Yeah!

4098
04:17:14,340 --> 04:17:14,620
Ow!

4099
04:17:15,100 --> 04:17:15,180
Ow!

4100
04:17:15,220 --> 04:17:15,700
Ow!

4101
04:17:15,720 --> 04:17:17,780
The captain's quarters should be right in front of you.

4102
04:17:19,920 --> 04:17:20,520
Uh-oh.

4103
04:17:20,620 --> 04:17:24,520
Tell us where the pulse is, if it's a bitch, before we go
full Pompeii on your ass.

4104
04:17:24,880 --> 04:17:26,360
Full Pompeii on my ass?

4105
04:17:26,460 --> 04:17:27,560
What kind of threat is that?

4106
04:17:27,840 --> 04:17:28,940
Are you gonna give me diarrhea?

4107
04:17:29,340 --> 04:17:29,860
Wait, no.

4108
04:17:30,980 --> 04:17:32,060
That was predictable.

4109
04:17:33,380 --> 04:17:33,560
Huh?

4110
04:17:35,800 --> 04:17:37,940
Oh, I don't think... Okay, I think you should...

4111
04:17:37,940 --> 04:17:38,400
Where the fuck is this thing?

4112
04:17:38,440 --> 04:17:39,200
Because that's not gonna hold me down.

4113
04:17:39,200 --> 04:17:41,120
Yeah, I don't think you could... That'll work.

4114
04:17:41,700 --> 04:17:42,340
The safe?

4115
04:17:42,560 --> 04:17:44,240
I don't know how to open a fucking safe.

4116
04:17:44,380 --> 04:17:44,660
Fuck.

4117
04:17:46,080 --> 04:17:49,040
I don't have confidence in you for the last one!

4118
04:17:49,500 --> 04:17:49,960
What the heck?

4119
04:17:49,960 --> 04:17:52,680
I didn't say this was excessive but...

4120
04:17:52,680 --> 04:17:54,460
You have to have confidence in me!

4121
04:17:54,620 --> 04:17:55,360
You almost through the door!

4122
04:17:56,400 --> 04:17:57,320
You have to have a confidence!

4123
04:17:57,680 --> 04:17:58,280
Oh, shoot.

4124
04:17:58,640 --> 04:17:59,020
Oh my god.

4125
04:17:59,120 --> 04:17:59,240
Oh.

4126
04:17:59,420 --> 04:18:00,800
I ran running him.

4127
04:18:00,980 --> 04:18:01,480
Well, okay.

4128
04:18:01,540 --> 04:18:03,140
You got to have confidence in me, okay.

4129
04:18:03,260 --> 04:18:04,000
Where else I'll cry.

4130
04:18:04,880 --> 04:18:05,040
Okay.

4131
04:18:05,300 --> 04:18:05,660
Let's...

4132
04:18:05,660 --> 04:18:06,180
Oh my god.

4133
04:18:06,360 --> 04:18:06,680
Oh my god.

4134
04:18:07,480 --> 04:18:08,120
Oh, shit.

4135
04:18:10,100 --> 04:18:10,460
Oh.

4136
04:18:10,600 --> 04:18:11,200
This is hard.

4137
04:18:11,340 --> 04:18:11,780
Wait a second.

4138
04:18:11,940 --> 04:18:12,800
This is really hard.

4139
04:18:12,960 --> 04:18:13,100
Oh.

4140
04:18:13,940 --> 04:18:14,300
Oh!

4141
04:18:15,720 --> 04:18:15,860
Ah!

4142
04:18:16,160 --> 04:18:16,320
Ah!

4143
04:18:17,580 --> 04:18:19,880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

4144
04:18:19,880 --> 04:18:20,960
Oh my god, oh my god.

4145
04:18:21,200 --> 04:18:21,460
Okay, wait.

4146
04:18:21,880 --> 04:18:23,240
Uh, no, no, no, no!

4147
04:18:24,980 --> 04:18:28,680
I need just not one guy to attack me, please!

4148
04:18:30,580 --> 04:18:32,580
I got an achievement, but I don't know for what.

4149
04:18:34,520 --> 04:18:35,800
Please, don't attack me.

4150
04:18:35,960 --> 04:18:37,720
I need, like, one guy to not attack me.

4151
04:18:37,840 --> 04:18:37,960
Okay.

4152
04:18:38,320 --> 04:18:38,920
Alright, hold on.

4153
04:18:39,320 --> 04:18:41,020
There's a thing here.

4154
04:18:41,240 --> 04:18:41,900
Oh, shit!

4155
04:18:42,500 --> 04:18:43,000
Oh my god.

4156
04:18:43,240 --> 04:18:43,940
Wait, did I run out?

4157
04:18:44,160 --> 04:18:44,240
Oh, shit.

4158
04:18:44,340 --> 04:18:44,940
There's no more.

4159
04:18:46,120 --> 04:18:46,600
Please!

4160
04:18:47,260 --> 04:18:47,360
Oh.

4161
04:18:47,940 --> 04:18:48,020
Oh.

4162
04:18:49,420 --> 04:18:50,100
Okay, that's fine.

4163
04:18:50,600 --> 04:18:51,580
I just need...

4164
04:18:51,580 --> 04:18:51,860
I can...

4165
04:18:51,860 --> 04:18:52,340
I'll be okay.

4166
04:18:52,560 --> 04:18:52,920
I'll be okay.

4167
04:18:53,300 --> 04:18:53,480
Maybe.

4168
04:18:55,300 --> 04:18:55,780
Yeah!

4169
04:19:03,380 --> 04:19:03,800
Woo!

4170
04:19:03,980 --> 04:19:04,040
Woo!

4171
04:19:04,040 --> 04:19:04,380
Woo!

4172
04:19:05,440 --> 04:19:05,820
All right.

4173
04:19:05,940 --> 04:19:06,500
Case open.

4174
04:19:06,700 --> 04:19:07,180
Is it in there?

4175
04:19:09,480 --> 04:19:10,940
I'm glad to be wrong!

4176
04:19:11,300 --> 04:19:11,360
Yeah!

4177
04:19:13,220 --> 04:19:14,520
Uh, you know what?

4178
04:19:14,780 --> 04:19:15,520
I guess it does.

4179
04:19:16,020 --> 04:19:16,220
Okay.

4180
04:19:16,580 --> 04:19:17,180
So now...

4181
04:19:17,180 --> 04:19:18,980
Who kind of thief doesn't know how to open a safe?

4182
04:19:19,020 --> 04:19:19,540
You're so right.

4183
04:19:20,420 --> 04:19:21,940
Uh oh.

4184
04:19:23,720 --> 04:19:24,600
Holy shit.

4185
04:19:24,820 --> 04:19:25,240
Are they?

4186
04:19:25,880 --> 04:19:27,440
Robert, what's going on?

4187
04:19:27,580 --> 04:19:28,060
I'm here.

4188
04:19:28,800 --> 04:19:29,420
Just hang on.

4189
04:19:29,720 --> 04:19:31,160
Trying to get the camera back online.

4190
04:19:32,160 --> 04:19:33,000
Um, that doesn't count.

4191
04:19:33,120 --> 04:19:33,400
I see you.

4192
04:19:33,700 --> 04:19:34,160
You're good.

4193
04:19:34,320 --> 04:19:36,560
Just take one step at a time.

4194
04:19:36,700 --> 04:19:36,940
Um.

4195
04:19:38,340 --> 04:19:38,820
Uh.

4196
04:19:40,240 --> 04:19:40,680
Uh.

4197
04:19:42,740 --> 04:19:43,220
Ooh.

4198
04:19:45,620 --> 04:19:46,100
Parasma.

4199
04:19:46,540 --> 04:19:47,160
Oh my god!

4200
04:19:47,180 --> 04:19:47,580
Stop!

4201
04:19:48,120 --> 04:19:49,260
Shroud, behind you!

4202
04:19:53,980 --> 04:19:55,220
Don't tell her to stop!

4203
04:19:55,440 --> 04:19:56,080
Tell her to run!

4204
04:19:57,200 --> 04:19:58,580
He's behind you!

4205
04:19:58,680 --> 04:19:59,000
Hey, Lizzie.

4206
04:19:59,400 --> 04:19:59,920
Stay calm.

4207
04:20:00,240 --> 04:20:01,300
Your inhaler is-

4208
04:20:06,380 --> 04:20:07,980
Don't tell her to stop!

4209
04:20:08,120 --> 04:20:08,840
Tell her to run!

4210
04:20:13,640 --> 04:20:14,340
Uh-oh.

4211
04:20:15,420 --> 04:20:16,760
Oh, that's so mean.

4212
04:20:17,180 --> 04:20:20,860
Hey, Vizzy, he's just going to keep fucking with you, but
you don't give up.

4213
04:20:21,260 --> 04:20:23,380
Okay, that's not how asthma works, I think.

4214
04:20:24,120 --> 04:20:27,320
I think people actually die from asthma when they don't have
inhalers.

4215
04:20:29,120 --> 04:20:29,520
Please.

4216
04:20:30,200 --> 04:20:31,960
Vizzy, hey, listen to me.

4217
04:20:32,160 --> 04:20:32,840
You get up.

4218
04:20:33,160 --> 04:20:33,700
Get up.

4219
04:20:35,700 --> 04:20:37,240
Oh, not the dog.

4220
04:20:38,280 --> 04:20:38,760
Keep up.

4221
04:20:39,980 --> 04:20:40,360
No!

4222
04:20:48,220 --> 04:20:49,200
He's gonna...

4223
04:20:49,220 --> 04:20:52,540
He's gonna die if he uses his powers anymore!

4224
04:20:53,140 --> 04:20:56,620
Okay, yeah, you're good.

4225
04:21:00,310 --> 04:21:00,830
Chase!

4226
04:21:06,650 --> 04:21:07,510
Chase!

4227
04:21:13,420 --> 04:21:15,740
Why is this...

4228
04:21:17,880 --> 04:21:20,880
Oh, fuck.

4229
04:21:21,780 --> 04:21:22,440
Where's my keys?

4230
04:21:23,200 --> 04:21:24,480
Where's my fucking keys?

4231
04:21:25,650 --> 04:21:26,300
Wake up.

4232
04:21:27,740 --> 04:21:30,680
No, no, no, I'll fucking do this, please.

4233
04:21:32,200 --> 04:21:33,060
Please, please.

4234
04:21:42,280 --> 04:21:42,740
Oh.

4235
04:21:47,900 --> 04:21:48,880
Oh my god.

4236
04:21:49,220 --> 04:21:52,500
Looking over at him doing the pose and I'm gonna be like,
keep up.

4237
04:21:53,060 --> 04:21:53,500
Oh no.

4238
04:21:57,200 --> 04:21:58,860
Oh my gosh.

4239
04:22:01,100 --> 04:22:02,320
There's your cliffhanger.

4240
04:22:04,020 --> 04:22:05,700
Oh my god.

4241
04:22:06,920 --> 04:22:08,640
Use his powers for her.

4242
04:22:08,780 --> 04:22:09,800
They just fought.

4243
04:22:14,230 --> 04:22:15,370
Oh my god.

4244
04:22:19,110 --> 04:22:20,410
Now we wait for one week?

4245
04:22:20,690 --> 04:22:21,090
No.

4246
04:22:21,510 --> 04:22:23,610
I'm going to be playing on Thursday.

4247
04:22:24,650 --> 04:22:27,370
So you only have to wait a day.

4248
04:22:29,170 --> 04:22:30,890
Day and a half, really.

4249
04:22:31,970 --> 04:22:35,350
You and 29% of players were ready to send the Z team to
retrieve the Astral Pulse.

4250
04:22:35,830 --> 04:22:36,310
Oh, dang.

4251
04:22:37,550 --> 04:22:38,550
Not many people.

4252
04:22:38,790 --> 04:22:40,250
I felt confident in us.

4253
04:22:40,250 --> 04:22:41,930
I think we have a good team.

4254
04:22:42,270 --> 04:22:43,570
I've been a good dispatcher.

4255
04:22:43,670 --> 04:22:45,810
I think everybody else sucks if they don't think we have...

4256
04:22:45,810 --> 04:22:48,130
If they have no confidence in being able to take it back.

4257
04:22:48,470 --> 04:22:49,290
That's what I think.

4258
04:22:51,130 --> 04:22:53,470
I've been a great dispatcher.

4259
04:22:56,010 --> 04:22:57,830
The 71% weren't locked in.

4260
04:22:57,930 --> 04:22:59,290
I was ready to do it.

4261
04:23:02,470 --> 04:23:03,490
Ooh, the music.

4262
04:23:04,630 --> 04:23:08,150
You and 69% of players help them visit Gal, locate the
Astral Pulse.

4263
04:23:08,670 --> 04:23:10,230
What else were the other people doing?

4264
04:23:10,250 --> 04:23:14,110
You and 39% of players dance with blonde blazer.

4265
04:23:15,270 --> 04:23:17,250
I can't say her name very well, but...

4266
04:23:18,590 --> 04:23:20,150
Yeah, baby, we're dancing with her.

4267
04:23:20,770 --> 04:23:23,310
You and 21% of players saluted.

4268
04:23:27,550 --> 04:23:32,310
You and 63% of players failed to deal with Van Gogh's
delivery bots.

4269
04:23:32,490 --> 04:23:32,810
Epsi!

4270
04:23:33,330 --> 04:23:35,450
45% of players befriended the mole people.

4271
04:23:36,690 --> 04:23:39,410
27% of players played as the bard.

4272
04:23:40,330 --> 04:23:42,410
Not a very popular choice, I guess.

4273
04:23:46,700 --> 04:23:50,060
Fun fact, the route Chase takes through the city is not the
fastest one.

4274
04:23:50,180 --> 04:23:51,040
He kept taking corners.

4275
04:23:51,200 --> 04:23:52,540
He was enjoying his last ride.

4276
04:23:55,460 --> 04:23:57,760
Your most set hero was Waterboy!

4277
04:23:59,740 --> 04:24:02,540
I performed better than 60% of players in today's shift.

4278
04:24:08,000 --> 04:24:10,600
Look, read it and weep, everybody.

4279
04:24:12,000 --> 04:24:14,700
Successful hero was Waterboy!

4280
04:24:20,660 --> 04:24:21,340
Yeah!

4281
04:24:22,800 --> 04:24:24,940
Everybody who doubted him.

4282
04:24:26,500 --> 04:24:27,940
Everybody who doubted him!

4283
04:24:29,120 --> 04:24:32,840
Peer upon how fierce he is and how cool.

4284
04:24:33,620 --> 04:24:34,920
Waterboy the goat!

4285
04:24:37,240 --> 04:24:39,320
Salmi, thank you so much for the freedom breaks!

4286
04:24:39,560 --> 04:24:39,980
Hello, hello!

4287
04:24:41,120 --> 04:24:43,080

4288
04:24:45,000 --> 04:24:52,780

4293
04:25:04,020 --> 04:25:04,700
Oh, shoot.

4294
04:25:05,420 --> 04:25:07,840
With the last two episodes.

4295
04:25:10,020 --> 04:25:12,100

4296
04:25:12,100 --> 04:25:12,500

4302
04:25:30,880 --> 04:25:33,160
No, it's gonna be kind of a...

4303
04:25:33,160 --> 04:25:34,240
Shut up, I can't think.

4304
04:25:34,640 --> 04:25:36,040
I'm trying to do like a redirect.

4305
04:25:36,660 --> 04:25:37,820
I thought I saw...

4306
04:25:39,280 --> 04:25:40,540
Phoebe was streaming.

4307
04:25:42,680 --> 04:25:49,120
But I subscribed to some channels that I watched the live
cams of, and I realized I didn't actually subscribe to them

4308
04:25:49,120 --> 04:25:49,480
yet.

4309
04:25:50,300 --> 04:26:01,540
maybe she was recording something um but anyway i subscribed
to them and now my so on the back end of youtube it's really

4310
04:26:01,540 --> 04:26:15,460
horrible trying to find somebody to to to raid into and um
live cams yeah like i have a live cam of like some deer and

4311
04:26:15,460 --> 04:26:28,620
i have a live cam of anoshima and i have a couple live cams
of mount fuji that I that I watch um and so I um I was like

4312
04:26:28,620 --> 04:26:34,880
oh I watched these like literally every day but I never rate
or I never uh subscribe to them I sometimes I just forget

4313
04:26:34,880 --> 04:26:41,580
even though I watch something a lot like forget to subscribe
I'm the worst I'm one of those people that's like needs the

4314
04:26:41,580 --> 04:26:55,280
reminder to like and subscribe because I because I forget to
do it and so I subscribed to one of them and this channel

4315
04:26:55,280 --> 04:27:06,460
has a bajillion so they have a bajillion live streams
happening at once so when you go to the redirect tab in

4316
04:27:06,460 --> 04:27:13,900
YouTube basically you have to it says like search videos for
from other channels and it kind of gives you like it says

4317
04:27:13,900 --> 04:27:14,780
videos from your

4318
04:27:19,820 --> 04:27:31,800
this one channel has so many live streams happening at once
and I'm okay this one two three four five times one two

4319
04:27:31,800 --> 04:27:47,220
three four five six seven eight nine ten ten so they have at
least 50 it has completely consumed my my tab so I can't

4320
04:27:47,220 --> 04:27:58,920
even i can't even like see who is live i would have to
search person by person it's kind of terrible she said the

4321
04:27:58,920 --> 04:28:00,140
thing oh whatever

4322
04:28:03,160 --> 04:28:13,740
but yeah so i'm like uh i think i have to unsubscribe so
that i can so that i can see people to raid into who's

viewers or something it's it's i it's really a no i don't
know it's like so i'm like what the heck i just wanted to

4326
04:28:45,880 --> 04:28:52,600

I watch their and the worst thing is as I only watch one of

4327
04:28:52,600 --> 04:28:59,240
their live streams one of their live cams because it's my
favorite one and so I'm like I don't need to see all of

these other ones thank you so much for the part get it the
tokusatsu channel tokusatsu oh my god before I subscribed to

4329
04:29:10,460 --> 04:29:16,980
this channel that was the other one that was making it
really difficult for me to find people to to raid into

4330
04:29:16,980 --> 04:29:23,200
because it was also they have so many live streams happening
at once there was so many that was that were taking over i

4331
04:29:23,200 --> 04:29:30,560
couldn't see it's really like it's not very intuitive
feature at all so insert picture of walter white in the back
