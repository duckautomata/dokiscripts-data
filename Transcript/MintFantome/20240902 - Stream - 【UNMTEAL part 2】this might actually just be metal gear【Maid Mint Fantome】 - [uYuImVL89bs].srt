1
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,810
Welcome back, Master.

2
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,470
Ojoisama.

3
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,130
Um, actually, I took like a couple bites of my food... breakfast.

4
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,770
And I'm...

5
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,190
That's what I'm like, just kind of been sitting here like...

6
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,170
For those who don't know, I got food poisoning.

7
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,490
Um, and you're probably like, yeah, you probably...

8
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,710
It was probably something really delicious and worth it, wasn't it?

9
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,330
Probably was something that like, you...

10
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,610
You know...

11
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,770
It sucks you got food poisoning, but in the moment, it was like the best thing you ever had, huh?

12
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,650
Meep!

13
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,810
Thank you for the 20 gift cards!

14
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,370
Thank you!

15
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,670
Um...

16
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,710
So after, I went to Anisama for two days.

17
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,730
The first day and the second day.

18
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,830
I did not go the third day.

19
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,990
Not because I didn't...

20
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,950
But I just didn't have a ticket.

21
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:52,830
I never bought a ticket.

22
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:54,890
Um...

23
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:56,830
But...

24
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,760
After...

25
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,100
After Anisama day two...

26
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,440
Maybe Korya takes a look after!

27
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,060
After Anisama day two...

28
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,780
Which if you don't know what Anisama is...

29
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,320
It's a big...

30
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,820
Anisong...

31
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,340
Event.

32
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,740
In...

33
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,180
It's like a three day event.

34
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,160
And it's really awesome.

35
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,520
They get like...

36
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,140
Oh my gosh.

37
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,760
I...

38
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,160
You know, I loved day two.

39
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,580
But day one was like incredible for me.

40
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,580
And um...

41
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,540
Uh...

42
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,520
I went because of an idol group.

43
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,080
I tried to eat Matara before she ate you, huh?

44
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,840
Uh...

45
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,640
That would probably just...

46
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,900
You know, that would probably actually kill me again.

47
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,140
Probably.

48
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,260
But...

49
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,880
Um...

50
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,100
Anisama day two...

51
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,720
I didn't tweet about it or anything.

52
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,860
Because...

53
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:51,760
Um...

54
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,120
I got home late and then I was like so tired.

55
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,680
And then I...

56
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,400
Went to sleep and then I...

57
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,980
Was up the whole night.

58
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,440
Throwing up.

59
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,220
And...

60
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:01,940
Um...

61
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,280
Laying on my floor in the hotel room crying.

62
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:07,980
But...

63
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,280
I...

64
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400
Um...

65
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,980
I...

66
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,960
Uh...

67
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,960
Um...

68
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,800
Day two was still so amazing.

69
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,300
Oh my gosh.

70
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,800
They opened with Aya Hirano.

71
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,400
Which if you don't know, she's the voice of Suzumiya Haruhi.

72
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,320
So...

73
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,980
Um...

74
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,800
She did three songs.

75
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,080
And one of them was Lost My Music.

76
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,140
And I was just like...

77
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,540
Oh my gosh.

78
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,560
This is so nostalgic.

79
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,400
Oh my gosh.

80
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,960
And then...

81
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,890
The last song...

82
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,840
She was just like...

83
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,420
She was like...

84
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,640
Okay.

85
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,660
I'm gonna sing this last song.

86
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,000
And...

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Oh my gosh.

88
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,540
They came out with the guitar.

89
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,660
And I was like...

90
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,060
Yes!

91
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,520
Yeah!

92
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,420
I was like...

93
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,040
Oh my god!

94
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,460
Oh my god!

95
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,100
It's gonna be...

96
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,720
God knows!

97
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,880
And it was...

98
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,660
Oh my gosh.

99
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:57,780
I was like...

100
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:57,920
Oh my gosh.

101
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,300
It was the most...

102
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,800
It was...

103
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,780
It was one of the highlights of my...

104
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,340
Of that day.

105
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:02,980
Because...

106
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,920
Even though it was like...

107
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,780
Basically...

108
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,620
The first person up.

109
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,780
Oh my gosh.

110
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,000
The whole room...

111
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,400
I say room.

112
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:10,940
The whole...

113
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,880
Like stadium.

114
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,960
Just lit orange.

115
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,860
Because everybody broke UO's.

116
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,840
It was like...

117
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
One of the brightest songs.

118
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,380
The whole night.

119
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,320
Because everybody was just so...

120
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,420
Excited.

121
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,100
It was like...

122
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,760
Oh my god!

123
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,980
It was so awesome!

124
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,320
And...

125
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,760
Um...

126
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,660
Oh my gosh!

127
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,540
It was so great.

128
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,840
Um...

129
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,660
And uh...

130
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,980
And um...

131
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,520
Sorry.

132
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm gonna talk a little bit.

133
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,900
Just to make sure my stomach...

134
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,700
Settles down a little bit.

135
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,960
Um...

136
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,480
But I also went for day two...

137
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,560
To see my seiyuu Oshi Ogura Yui.

138
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,000
And she was...

139
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,280
She was so cute!

140
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,700
Oh my god!

141
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh my god!

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,680
It was my first time ever seeing her.

143
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,740
Oh my god!

144
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,700
And I was like...

145
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,880
Oh, she's such an angel.

146
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,820
She was the cutest ever!

147
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,300
Ooh!

148
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,620
She was so cute!

149
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,640
Oh my gosh!

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,720
I was...

151
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,160
I was...

152
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,620
Screaming my head off.

153
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm surprised I have a voice right now.

154
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,760
Um...

155
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,080
But day one was...

156
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,560
So much of a highlight.

157
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,480
Because...

158
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,880
Um...

159
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,020
Because...

160
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,440
Uh...

161
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
My favorite idol group, Denpokumi Inc.

162
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,600
Was there!

163
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:27,720
And...

164
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
Um...

165
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,820
One of the songs...

166
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,640
They had an intermission.

167
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,780
Because the event is actually quite long.

168
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,300
It's from like...

169
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,900
4pm...

170
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,560
To...

171
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,560
9ish...

172
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,080
About.

173
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,580
9ish...

174
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,540
Like 9.30...

175
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,180
Depending.

176
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,620
And uh...

177
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,400
Um...

178
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,420
Before...

179
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,040
Before the intermission...

180
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,700
Um...

181
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,440
The singer...

182
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,020
For...

183
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,940
We are...

184
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,020
One Piece?

185
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,320
Was singing...

186
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,580
One Piece?

187
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,480
One Piece?

188
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,040
Was singing...

189
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,100
We are...

190
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,700
And all the acts came out...

191
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,060
And so I got to see my favorite idol group...

192
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,500
Singing we are...

193
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,720
Together...

194
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,400
And I was just like...

195
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,640
This is like the best...

196
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Moment...

197
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,280
Of my...

198
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,900
Life...

199
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,380
Maybe...

200
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,640
My...

201
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,680
My...

202
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,560
Living life...

203
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,620
My afterlife...

204
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,320
My whole...

205
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,780
My whole lives...

206
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,400
But um...

207
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,620
Oh!

208
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,360
And then day two...

209
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,800
Um...

210
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,960
One of my favorite anime song singers...

211
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,500
Um...

212
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,560
Suzuki Konomi...

213
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:27,720
And...

214
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,680
It was there too...

215
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,700
And um...

216
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,440
She...

217
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,460
Oh my gosh...

218
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,800
The way they introduced her...

219
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,480
Was so great...

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,400
Because...

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Um...

222
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,640
She...

223
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,280
It was...

224
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,100
We were waiting for the next artist to start...

225
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,200
And then you just hear...

226
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,880
And I was like...

227
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,300
Because that's the sound from ReZero...

228
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,180
And she does a bunch of songs from ReZero...

229
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,840
So I was just like...

230
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,080
I was so excited...

231
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,640
And...

232
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,340
I was like...

233
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:57,960
Um...

234
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,080
And I was thinking...

235
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,640
I was just like...

236
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,320
One of my favorite songs from ReZero...

237
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,840
One of my favorite songs by her...

238
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,060
Is actually a song...

239
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,360
From an anime...

240
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,360
Um...

241
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,020
Oh gosh...

242
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,300
Like...

243
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,060
Motenai...

244
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,220
The...

245
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,620
The like...

246
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:09,840
Um...

247
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,720
It's not my fault...

248
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,760
I'm not popular...

249
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,160
Anime or whatever...

250
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,620
And um...

251
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,160
And uh...

252
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,440
Did you see?

253
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,080
Pricka Day is doing another ReZero collab...

254
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,500
I know!

255
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,360
I know!

256
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,020
Yeah!

257
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,520
Watamote!

258
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,260
Watamote!

259
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,460
Yes!

260
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:24,860
Thank you!

261
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,500
Oh my gosh...

262
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,780
Sorry...

263
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,220
My brain...

264
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,840
I'm just waking up a little bit...

265
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,480
Um...

266
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,980
Yes!

267
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,700
Watamote!

268
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,860
And I was like...

269
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,320
You know...

270
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
To see her perform that ever...

271
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,960
Would be like...

272
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,200
You know...

273
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,100
Kind of a pipe dream...

274
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,820
I was just like...

275
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,720
But I was thinking it...

276
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:36,980
Like...

277
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,280
When she...

278
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,700
When I...

279
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:37,980
Like...

280
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,620
When she came on...

281
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,060
I was just like...

282
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,880
It would be so awesome to hear either that...

283
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,980
Or to hear...

284
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,580
Um...

285
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,100
Redo?

286
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,840
Since I did a cover of Redo...

287
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,700
So I was just like...

288
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:46,880
Wah!

289
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,620
Either would be so great...

290
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,280
And actually...

291
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,580
She did a collab with Serizawa Yu...

292
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,080
Which is another Seiyuu that I really really love...

293
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,820
Um...

294
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,340
She's also part of IRIS...

295
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,460
Another idol group...

296
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,820
An any song idol group...

297
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,260
Basically...

298
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,760
And I was like...

299
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,380
Oh my gosh...

300
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,240
Serizawa Yu and Konomin singing together?

301
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,420
Oh my god...

302
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,860
I'm gonna...

303
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,380
I'm just gonna throw up here...

304
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm just gonna...

305
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,980
I'm just gonna...

306
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,180
Go to heaven here...

307
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,020
What's happening?

308
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,480
You did a cover of Redo?

309
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:14,780
Yeah!

310
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,040
I didn't...

311
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,660
Private it...

312
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,660
It's still on my channel...

313
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,880
And um...

314
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,540
Uh...

315
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,360
They actually...

316
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,380
Did a cover...

317
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,600
Of one of...

318
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,920
Um...

319
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Of one of...

320
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,380
Uh...

321
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,460
Serizawa Yu's songs...

322
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,680
Debiru...

323
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,080
And I was like...

324
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,960
Kawaii...

325
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,920
And then afterwards...

326
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,640
They were just like...

327
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:34,780
Cause...

328
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,980
Konomin is just like...

329
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,600
I'm always so...

330
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,020
You know...

331
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,460
I'm always so...

332
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,320
Cool...

333
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,280
I have this cool image...

334
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,140
I wanna be cute...

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,220
And so they did...

336
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,600
They did that song...

337
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,360
And then...

338
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
She was just like...

339
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,220
Oh...

340
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,260
What's this reaction?

341
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,560
Maybe...

342
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,280
Maybe I'm not very cute at all...

343
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,720
Maybe I'm not very cute...

344
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,520
And then...

345
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,260
They also...

346
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,500
Then afterwards...

347
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
They led in with that...

348
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,160
So they were just like...

349
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,440
It's...

350
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,460
It's...

351
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,360
It's not my fault...

352
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,440
I'm not cute...

353
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,180
And so...

354
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,540
Then they led in to...

355
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,180
Doing the...

356
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,440
Watamote opening...

357
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,420
And I was just like...

358
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,460
I was...

359
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,740
I was...

360
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,500
I was...

361
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,380
Screaming...

362
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,620
I was going crazy...

363
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,300
I was like...

364
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,540
It was so great...

365
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,960
I just love any song...

366
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,200
Like...

367
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,960
Trisail was there...

368
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,480
Um...

369
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,380
Oh my gosh...

370
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,860
Uh...

371
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,520
Sorry...

372
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:22,880
Um...

373
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,660
So much...

374
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,480
So many people...

375
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,240
Were there...

376
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
And I'm just like...

377
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,080
Wow...

378
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
It was so...

379
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,780
It was such a...

380
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,200
It was such a great time...

381
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,960
So...

382
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,580
Yeah...

383
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,580
I did that...

384
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,800
And then yesterday...

385
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,380
Oh my gosh...

386
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:35,860
You guys...

387
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,460
Oh my gosh...

388
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,360
I had a dream come true yesterday actually...

389
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,860
But I can't talk about it yet...

390
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,160
But even though I had food poisoning...

391
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,880
I pushed myself because I was like...

392
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,420
This is the most important...

393
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,040
Day of my afterlife maybe...

394
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:57,880
So...

395
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,380
Um...

396
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,240
Ahahaha...

397
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,260
But that should...

398
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:01,680
Uh...

399
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,090
Be out soon-ish...

400
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,400
I got bad news about my postcards...

401
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,340
I found them ripped...

402
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,360
In two...

403
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,560
In the recycle bin...

404
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,340
I taped them back together...

405
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,780
Oh my gosh...

406
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,140
I'm so sorry...

407
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,980
Wait...

408
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,200
What?

409
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,720
Did like someone rip them up?

410
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,800
I'm so sorry...

411
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,580
No...

412
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,860
I'm sorry...

413
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:56,480
But yeah, sorry, my brain is a little foggy, because I haven't gotten much sleep, because, you know, the night before I was up all night, I didn't sleep even a little bit, because I was so sick, and last night I was just like, I didn't sleep at all the night before,

414
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,840
I'm going to get so much sleep.

415
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:06,500
And I ended up going to sleep around, like, midnight, and then still, my body wakes me up at 6am.

416
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,900
I'm like, why?

417
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,940
Why did you do this to me?

418
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,420
I have some... oh, my food poisoning, that's right.

419
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:20,540
After Anisama, it was very late when I got back, because it's in Saitama, it's a little far.

420
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,100
And so, not a lot of places were open.

421
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,780
There was actually a noodle place that's kind of close to my hotel.

422
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,840
That I was like, I'm going to go eat there, because I'm pretty sure it's 24 hours.

423
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,260
And I get there, and it was not 24 hours.

424
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,160
In fact, I was standing outside the door being like, oh, my gosh, this place is supposed to be 24 hours.

425
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:46,140
And a staff worker saw me, and then, like, came outside the door and shooed me away.

426
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,180
He was like, we're not open.

427
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,940
And I was like, no!

428
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,420
And so, instead I was like, okay, well, you know what?

429
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,840
The only thing that's...

430
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,960
The only thing that's close to my hotel is McDonald's.

431
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,400
McDonald's!

432
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:21,420
And I was like, oh, they have a teriyaki cheesy burger or something, something.

433
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:21,540
Something.

434
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,350
That's what did me in.

435
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,720
That's what did me in.

436
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,000
So, now I'm here with Un-Metal.

437
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,020
And some morning spaghetti.

438
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,560
Hopefully the spaghetti.

439
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,620
I thought maybe something like a pasta would be easy on my tum tum.

440
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,660
Maybe.

441
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,330
It's got lettuce in it.

442
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,950
Robbed by the hamburglar.

443
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,760
When you want ramen but get McDonald's...

444
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,500
I know I was so in the mood too.

445
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,800
I was so in the mood for ramen.

446
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,180
Forgive me Minto for I have sinned.

447
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,180
I might own a certain spicy doggy.

448
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,920
What does that mean?

449
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,060
Sorry, I'm choking on my spit.

450
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,580
Went to my first maid cafe at Idol Fest to repent.

451
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,580
Said Japan was fun.

452
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,680
I'm glad you had fun!

453
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,380
Minto's not McLovin' it.

454
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,660
No.

455
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,520
In fact, I was kind of excited too.

456
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,960
Because I was like, oh they had that advertisement recently.

457
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,660
Like the Japanese McDonald's had a recent advertisement that was like...

458
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,160
Using Marisa Stoll the precious thing.

459
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,140
So I was like, you know what?

460
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,520
Maybe Touhou will save me.

461
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,200
Maybe Touhou will save me.

462
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,300
But it did not.

463
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,380
Anyway.

464
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,820
Let's play UnMetal.

465
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,760
I'm not sure how far I will get in today.

466
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,980
If I beat it, if I have a crazy hair and I beat it, awesome.

467
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,020
If not, we'll just go a couple hours.

468
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,700
The super chat is from iDaggit.

469
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,120
Oh my god, that scared me.

470
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,340
Sent bravely default.

471
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,120
Sorry for delay.

472
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,440
Thank you!

473
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm pretty sure I got it.

474
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,120
Thank you, thank you.

475
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,600
You are a soup.

476
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,740
I wish I had soup right now.

477
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,520
Nine years ago, their private army was decimated by a secret organization.

478
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,100
These men escaped to a new base off the coast of Africa.

479
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,420
Today they survived as soldiers of fortune.

480
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,760
If you have a problem...

481
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,860
If you can find them...

482
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,060
Maybe you can hire...

483
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,640
The D-Dogs.

484
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,900
Oh my gosh, you guys.

485
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,020
It's been nine years since Metal Gear Solid V.

486
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,140
Isn't that so crazy?

487
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,340
And then everybody was just like, you can only post this today.

488
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,020
Of the doctor being like, it's been nine years.

489
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,860
Oh my gosh.

490
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,460
That's my phone.

491
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:25,920
Hold on.

492
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,980
Oh my god.

493
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,100
The alarm is going off.

494
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,200
It's like, wake up.

495
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,940
Oh.

496
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,280
Oh, my tummy.

497
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,340
Oh, it hurts to move.

498
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm afraid it's been nine years.

499
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,000
Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.

500
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,620
Shut off alarm.

501
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,860
Wait, what is this?

502
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,460
Oh my god.

503
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,840
Someone just texted this to me.

504
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,480
And I saw this earlier.

505
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,760
You guys, I saw this earlier and I like jumped out of bed.

506
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,460
Apparently, Edgeworth is going to be a skin in Among Us.

507
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,260
Like, Edgeworth from Ace Attorney is going to be a skin in Among Us.

508
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,720
What is going on?

509
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,090
I've had several people message it to me.

510
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:20,850
And I'm like, look!

511
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,930
Ace Attorney in Among Us!

512
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,470
And I was like, why only Edgeworth?

513
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,590
But it makes sense because of the...

514
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,370
because of the...

515
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,230
the...

516
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,010
the remake.

517
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,580
Thank you!

518
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,760
Ahem.

519
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,040
The collection coming up?

520
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,180
Shame it's not Godot.

522
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,200
Makes sense, I mean.

523
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:56,820
Okay.

524
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,940
Let's load game.

525
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,100
I'm gonna have to remember how to play this, so give me a moment.

526
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,900
Give me a moment.

527
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,680
A moment.

528
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,700
So this is Punch.

529
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,280
Um, this is Roll.

530
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,260
Which I never use.

531
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,380
I got like a comment on the Vi last time that was just like, She didn't even roll one time!

532
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,860
She doesn't even know there's a roll button!

533
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,420
And I was like, AH!

534
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,720
Sorry, I just kicked my mic.

535
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,940
Um...

536
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,800
Actually, I did roll.

537
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,500
Like maybe five times.

538
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,120
Okay?

539
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,680
I rolled maybe like five times.

540
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,060
Okay?

541
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,800
What's going on?

542
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,420
Hold on.

543
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,160
Um, shoot.

544
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,420
Uh, W is the codex.

545
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
So let's talk to Colonel.

546
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,020
Copy.

547
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,140
I managed to leave the building.

548
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,780
Now, you have to get as far away as you can.

549
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,100
I'm on it.

550
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,080
Damn.

551
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,420
This jungle is dense.

552
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,300
You're a suit.

553
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,460
Thank you!

554
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,300
Hope you feel better soon, mate.

555
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,760
Thank you so much for the cookie.

556
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
What about, um, this is Robert, right?

557
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:11,960
Jesse here.

558
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,960
Do you copy?

559
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,140
I hear ya.

560
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,680
Oh, okay.

561
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,340
Um, shoot.

562
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,160
What else was there?

563
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,240
Space is to like, fire the gun.

564
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,780
How do I get into my inventory?

565
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,400
Um...

566
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,280
My area.

567
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,940
How do I get into my inventory?

568
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,320
F?

569
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:31,900
Oh, F.

570
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,540
Okay, perfect.

571
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,840
Okay.

572
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,040
Um...

573
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,720
And then...

574
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,850
C was to use stuff, I think.

575
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,320
Look, I'm rolling.

576
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,500
How do I get what's in the truck?

577
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,140
Ooh!

578
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,840
Die, truck!

579
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,960
Die, truck!

580
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,620
Die, truck!

581
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,800
Die, truck!

582
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,900
I forgot the potty.

583
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,100
Yeah, we have a used one.

584
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,380
And then we have an unused potty.

585
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,420
Okay, it's gonna take... Oh, there's three guys down there.

586
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,400
Okay, let's try this way.

587
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,160
In my escape, I ran into a gang of hounds that were sound asleep.

588
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:21,500
Ahhh!

589
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:23,760
Oh my god!

590
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,560
Oh my god!

591
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,260
Smell...

592
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,740
Ears...

593
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,500
Uh...

594
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,020
Hear...

595
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,180
Uh...

596
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,260
Still ears...

597
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:40,860
Still ears...

598
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,980
Their sense of hearing was 100 times stronger than ours.

599
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,140
I had to pass between them very slowly in order to keep them asleep.

600
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,980
The further I could tiptoe around them, the better.

601
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,820
To advance slowly, press and release the direction key repeatedly.

602
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,320
Don't keep it pressed.

603
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,880
Wait...

604
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,780
Like that?

605
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,460
Like this?

606
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,780
Don't keep it...

607
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,060
Like...

608
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,940
Like that?

609
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,900
Tap, tap, tap, tap...

610
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,300
Tap, tap, tap, tap...

611
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,540
Tap, tap, tap, tap...

612
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:19,680
Tap, tap, tap...

613
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,080
Thank

614
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,710
you, thank you!

615
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,310
Chu!

616
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,210
Chu!

617
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,170
Good luck on your adventures!

618
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,190
And notice the video title is Unmetal.

619
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,550
Sounds like something to rival Metal Gear.

620
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,350
Tap,

621
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,990
tap, tap, tap...

622
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,710
Tap, tap, tap, tap...

623
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,910
Tap, tap, tap, tap...

624
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,590
Tap, tap, tap, tap...

625
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:55,810
Ah!

626
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,990
Oh my god, that guy's trying to escape.

627
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,910
Oh shoot, okay.

628
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,590
Oh!

629
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:08,220
Mike, aren't we supposed to shoot him?

630
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,400
No need.

631
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,960
Let's make a bet, Mike.

632
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,300
How high?

633
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,600
How high what?

634
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,780
Fuck!

635
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,960
The landmines!

636
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,360
Oh!

637
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,440
The look on your face!

638
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,260
Mike, you're a dick.

639
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,240
Yeah, I know.

640
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,700
Oh my god!

641
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,800
It was like, how high his body's gonna fly?

642
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,750
Could I have saved him, you think?

643
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,170
Oh!

644
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,610
Oh, no!

645
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,910
I think... oh, uh, see, see, see, see.

646
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,350
Okay, we're fine, everybody.

647
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,930
We only... okay, how do I loot them again?

648
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:56,690
X?

649
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,670
Yeah, okay, okay.

650
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,470
We're fine!

651
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,830
I remember how to play the game.

652
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,430
I remember how to play the game.

653
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,030
So, this way is the landmines.

654
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,690
Oh.

655
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,270
Oh, that's not very funny.

656
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,790
Why'd you hit Mike first?

657
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,070
It's just... what happened?

658
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,800
We'll put him by the tree.

659
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,590
What is this?

660
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,970
Why is this a question mark area?

661
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,910
I feel asleep.

662
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,490
Hey!

663
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,570
It's... I'm sleepy.

664
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,370
Oh, thanks.

665
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,090
I'm sleepy.

666
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,650
Jon, I'm sleepy.

667
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,350
Oh my gosh.

668
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,950
Yippee!

669
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,130
I feel asleep.

670
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,830
They even put this in the game.

671
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,030
They even put that in the game.

672
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,730
Why is everything question marks though?

673
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,290
Oh my gosh.

674
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,090
I love that reference.

675
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:14,970
Wee!

676
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,570
Wee!

677
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,830
Wee!

678
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,390
Oh!

679
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,930
I splattered all over.

680
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,150
Not that funny, Teehee.

681
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,470
I said that.

682
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,470
I said it wasn't very funny.

683
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,770
So sad.

684
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,750
He's all splattered.

685
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,070
I don't remember how to use the gun.

686
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:36,970
Never mind.

687
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,090
I remember how to use the gun.

688
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,340
What is this place?

689
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,800
Why is it so spooky?

690
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,440
Oh!

691
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,520
Okay.

692
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:58,800
Um...

693
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,980
I wonder if...

694
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,260
Does it...

695
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,000
How do I wear it?

696
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,340
Oh shoot.

697
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,060
How do I wear this?

698
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,780
No, no, no, no.

699
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,720
Oh my god.

700
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,160
How do I wear it?

701
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,640
I can't remember how to put it on.

702
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:15,700
See?

703
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,600
Oh, see, see, see.

704
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:16,920
There we go.

705
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,220
Viewers are reacting to a player named Mike killing the streamer in a game of Among Us.

706
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,520
Okay.

707
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,440
Never mind.

708
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,260
That didn't do anything.

709
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:28,900
Interesting.

710
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,600
Okay.

711
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,160
Well, this is a mysterious place.

712
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,260
Uh...

713
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,290
It sounds scary.

714
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,370
It sounds like a horror room.

715
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,450
We shall be back.

716
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,170
We shall be back.

717
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,510
Use chaff.

718
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,570
Okay, let's go to the other side.

719
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,870
Okay,

720
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:57,950
let's go to the other side.

721
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,650
Can I go down, you think?

722
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,930
Is there a landmine or landmines?

723
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,290
Hmm...

724
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,330
Hmm...

725
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:33,930
Hmm...

726
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,830
Um...

727
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,470
You guys, I...

728
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,390
Well...

729
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,770
I accidentally touched the doll.

730
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,250
This is fine, actually, because...

731
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,530
Now I didn't lose any health to those spooky... to that gun thing.

732
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,350
So you know what?

733
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:48,970
This actually works.

734
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,510
That was actually the ideal situation.

735
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:55,650
I think.

736
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,020
This part is going to be annoying to get back through.

737
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,980
I think.

738
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,020
My depth perception, you guys.

739
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,940
My depth perception.

740
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,160
My depth perception.

741
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,560
There's three guys here.

742
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,820
Dog, dog.

743
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,680
Don't send dog, dog.

744
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,380
Can I punch this?

745
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,080
Hmm...

746
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,820
What would be...

747
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,380
the best way...

748
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,980
to do this?

749
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,480
Hmm...

750
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,800
A

751
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,310
chloroform?

752
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,410
A chloroform?

753
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,170
Do I have that?

754
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,370
Oh, I have to, like, soak the...

755
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,150
Wait...

756
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,350
The chloro...

757
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:10,890
Oh, wait!

758
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,390
I have it!

759
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:11,650
I have it!

760
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:11,970
I have it!

761
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,650
This, right?

762
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,910
If I use this...

763
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,810
Will they go to sleep?

764
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,570
I'm sleepy.

765
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,690
I have to be fast, though.

766
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,610
I have to be fast, though.

767
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,030
Hmm...

768
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,010
I think I should take one guy out...

769
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,150
before the other guy looks...

770
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,030
and then shoot the other guy.

771
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,790
I feel asleep.

772
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,330
How's the audio, by the way?

773
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,150
Let me know if too quiet...

774
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,310
or too loud, or whatever.

775
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,670
Never mind.

776
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:06,710
I didn't have to shoot him at all.

777
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:07,970
Yippee!

778
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,290
It's good?

779
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,210
Okay, cool.

780
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,270
Oh!

781
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:23,940
Wait.

782
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,080
I thought this was...

783
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,340
stamina.

784
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,220
Okay.

785
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,840
Alright.

786
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

787
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,040
Heh, heh, heh.

788
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,040
What's down here?

789
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,840
The gate was locked.

790
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,760
I had to look for another exit.

791
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,220
Oh.

792
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,340
Well, what was the point of me coming down here, then?

793
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm gonna put him inside the truck.

794
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,580
All guys go in truck.

795
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,620
All guys go in truck.

796
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,190
All truck.

797
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,620
Come here.

798
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,560
Alright.

799
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,520
Okay.

800
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,680
All truck.

801
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,180
Nice.

802
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,980
Easy, easy, easy.

803
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,900
So we have to go back through the dogs again.

804
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,230
We do have the god mode.

805
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,850
We can use...

806
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,270
Bill Cipher.

807
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,730
I feel like a...

808
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,530
Goofy.

809
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:02,990
I...

810
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,450
I don't know.

811
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,770
What if it was just one leg?

812
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,090
What if it was one mine?

813
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,470
What if it was just one?

814
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:13,910
I wish I could save.

815
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,310
Oh, wait.

816
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,210
I can use my potty.

817
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,770
But we don't know when the next bathroom is.

818
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:20,650
Uh...

819
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,390
How high, chat?

820
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:28,910
No!

821
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,110
Heh, heh, heh.

822
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,170
Don't say it like that!

823
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,110
What if I beat up the machine that's controlling...

824
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:40,490
the...

825
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,770
That's controlling...

826
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:46,850
Whatever the...

827
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,550
The turret.

828
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,700
Okay, fine.

829
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,740
Oh, ru...

830
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,780
Shoot the turret.

831
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,300
Maybe?

832
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,000
I thought about that too, I'll be honest.

833
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,160
Let's try it.

834
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,520
Okay.

835
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,500
Maybe I can dodge and shoot.

836
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,480
Okay.

837
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,480
This is...

838
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,220
Okay.

839
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,450
Oh.

840
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,790
Yeah!

841
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,110
Yeah!

842
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:34,730
Yeah!

843
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,520
I'm scared in here, you guys!

844
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,080
Wait, this is scary!

845
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,740
Come on.

846
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,440
Ouch!

847
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,700
I messed up.

848
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,440
Heh, heh, heh.

849
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,840
Um...

850
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,560
It's okay.

851
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,980
Heh, heh, heh.

852
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,620
Oh.

853
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:14,960
Hold on.

854
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:15,760
I need the timing.

855
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,160
This is locked.

856
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,440
Oh, yeah, we need a key.

857
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,180
It's okay, we're getting this out of the way.

858
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,680
Wait, this area is so scary, though.

859
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,580
Okay.

860
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,740
Okay.

861
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,340
Yeah!

862
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,180
I need a key.

863
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,740
Again.

864
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,520
Oh.

865
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,470
Shoot.

866
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:52,970
Oh.

867
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:54,470
Shoot.

868
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,870
Where's the aim?

869
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:56,970
Oh.

870
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,470
Dang it.

871
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,390
Come on.

872
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,050
Come on.

873
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,290
Yeah!

874
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,710
Gonna run out of health packs here.

875
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,110
Gonna run out of health packs here.

876
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,550
Reload?

877
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:11,890
Thank you.

878
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,670
I shall, I shall, I shall.

879
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:15,030
I shall, I shall, I shall.

880
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,210
Oh!

881
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:17,890
Shoot!

882
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,210
Oh!

883
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:18,290
Oh!

884
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,860
I still got it.

885
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,700
Into the wall.

886
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,060
I bet she doesn't even know how to roll.

887
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,780
Take that, mister.

888
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,800
Oh, you can just use bandages.

889
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,360
That's so true.

890
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:44,780
I forgot.

891
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,420
Thank you.

892
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,920
Yeah, you know what?

893
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,460
We're gonna...

894
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,960
We're gonna do that for now.

895
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,460
Unless we get really low on health.

896
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,650
Happy 9 years.

897
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,170
Thank you!

898
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,790
Happy 9 years.

899
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:06,790
Thank you!

900
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,190
Happy 9 years.

901
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,190
Thank you!

902
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,250
I don't know why I said thank you.

903
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,070
Yeah, happy 9...

904
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,270
Yeah, happy 9...

905
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,630
Yeah, it's my...

906
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:15,790
Yeah, it's my...

907
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,410
9-year Metal Gear anniversary.

908
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,970
I had a feeling that was gonna be there.

909
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,350
Come on.

910
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,030
Yeah!

911
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,930
Yeah!

912
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,550
Wait, I wonder if I can punch it.

913
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,610
I keep shooting though.

914
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,110
Okay, that one's a little far.

915
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:54,950
Yeah!

916
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,210
Oh my gosh, I feel so powerful every time.

917
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,610
I feel so powerful every time.

918
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,670
Yeah!

919
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,630
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

920
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,250
Hahaha.

921
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,350
Haha.

922
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,130
There's a door.

923
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:27,770
Reload.

924
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,940
Yeah, I'm a badass.

925
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,800
Oh, I still can't.

926
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,660
Even from the other side?

927
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,240
Okay.

928
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,500
But we did it!

929
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,540
Oh!

930
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,800
Oh!

931
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,160
Oh!

932
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,160
Party!

933
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,660
We did it!

934
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,320
Yeah!

935
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,400
And we got a first aid kit.

936
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,660
And we got a first aid kit.

937
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,800
Um,

938
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,200
will night heat resistant suit work here?

939
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:23,940
Um, will night heat resistant suit work here?

940
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,320
It is for heat related tasks.

941
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,420
Will this work?

942
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,260
I mean...

943
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,280
Oh, hell yeah!

944
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,660
Yippee!

945
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,900
Oh, okay, nice.

946
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,620
You're pretty good.

947
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,880
Thanks!

948
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,760
Whoa!

949
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,420
Nice!

950
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,680
I'll take it.

951
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,560
I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it.

952
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,720
I'll take it, I'll take it, I'll take it.

953
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,540
Beep.

954
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,180
Okay.

955
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,980
Very good.

956
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,040
Alright.

957
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,040
More bullets.

958
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,300
Okay.

959
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,480
This is like the fury.

960
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,660
Oh!

961
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,140
Okay.

962
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,280
Is my suit gonna get like too hot or something?

963
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,940
Is it gonna be like, oh no!

964
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,980
I can't handle it anymore!

965
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,760
Lucky.

966
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,800
This looks like a boss room.

967
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,380
Ugh, listening to stream while at work.

968
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,840
Good luck with work!

969
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,480
Sci-fi!

970
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,200
What's this?

971
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,060
Oh.

972
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,680
Jesse here.

973
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,340
Over.

974
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,860
Shit, there's no signal down here.

975
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,640
Oh, okay.

976
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:50,200
There was nobody in the room, but my instincts told me it was a perfect place for a trap.

977
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,800
That's what I said!

978
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,340
That's what I said!

979
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,920
I knew it!

980
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,820
Oh my god, no.

981
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,760
No, no, no.

982
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,320
Oh my gosh, wait!

983
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

984
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,620
I pressed the wrong button instead of...

985
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,080
I pressed heal instead of...

986
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,660
I pressed heal instead of roll.

987
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,080
Okay.

988
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,300
We have our gun.

989
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,600
Let's attach this.

990
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,060
We have...

991
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,020
We have dodge.

992
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,860
We have our roll.

993
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,040
We have our rolls.

994
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,820
We have our rolls.

995
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,340
We got our buttons.

996
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,100
We've got...

997
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,080
Everything we need.

998
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,560
Okay!

999
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,660
Ikimasu.

1000
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,100
There was nobody in the room, but...

1001
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,700
Alright.

1002
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:46,720
Shop.

1003
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,180
Shop.

1004
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,240
Wow!

1005
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,860
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

1006
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:02,620
No!

1007
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:05,630
You bastard!

1008
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,630
I think I better die here.

1009
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,650
That one was so dirty though.

1010
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,250
It came out right next to me.

1011
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,230
I didn't even have a...

1012
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,570
I didn't even have time to dodge it because it was right there.

1013
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,070
It was right next to me.

1014
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:29,610
I just realized also my cursor has been on the screen this whole time, hasn't it?

1015
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:30,130
I'm so sorry.

1016
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:33,290
Okay.

1017
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,530
In fact, it might be better to do the first aid kit instead.

1018
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:41,990
Oh,

1019
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,250
was it there?

1020
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:48,850
Oh.

1021
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,970
I thought it was there.

1022
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:50,410
Maybe not.

1023
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:50,890
I don't know.

1024
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:51,390
Anyway.

1025
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:52,890
Okay.

1026
00:43:54,210 --> 00:44:01,250
Okay, so it's the top one first, and then this one over here, and then this one over here, and there's one... two in the corner down there.

1027
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:02,690
Okay.

1028
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,090
There was nobody in the room, but...

1029
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,530
Turret store.

1030
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,430
And I can run away.

1031
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,270
Oh my gosh.

1032
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,510
The dodge has a...

1033
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,830
has a bit of a cool down.

1034
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:27,310
No save spot!

1035
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:27,930
Oh my god.

1036
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,830
They just shoot through the...

1037
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,450
There's no save spot!

1038
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,550
They shoot through the...

1039
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,630
through the things.

1040
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:40,610
That's tough.

1041
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:41,530
This is tricky.

1042
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,150
Yeah, there's no cover.

1043
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,410
Okay, yeah.

1044
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,370
I just can't get hit.

1045
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:49,730
Okay.

1046
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,190
Okay.

1047
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,310
There was nobody in the room.

1048
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1049
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,750
Oh my gosh!

1050
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:02,930
Oh my gosh!

1051
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,400
I thought it would be over!

1052
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,960
I don't know why I thought that!

1053
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,480
Okay, I think it's just this one then.

1054
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,220
Nothing else has popped up.

1055
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh my god, dodge!

1056
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,200
What the...

1057
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,740
We can...

1058
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,460
Oh, I can shoot through here then too then.

1059
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:42,980
Oh my gosh.

1060
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:45,760
Wait.

1061
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,740
Oh, I'm out of bullets!

1062
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:48,960
No!

1063
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,950
Boss defeated!

1064
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,180
Reloads!

1065
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,920
That's what I needed just then.

1066
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,360
I needed the reloads gun automatically in this very moment.

1067
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,120
I needed the reloads gun automatically in this very moment.

1068
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,720
That might be better though.

1069
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,420
I want the camouflage, but I think the...

1070
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,460
I think the...

1071
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,440
Gunslinger might be better for me.

1072
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:38,910
Oops, sorry.

1073
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,130
Enemies further than 4 yards can't detect you if you're flat against a wall.

1074
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:52,630
The camo seems OP though.

1075
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,510
Why gunslinger?

1076
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:01,910
You can't...

1077
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,070
I feel like... okay.

1078
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,770
I feel like the...

1079
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,350
Gunslinger is also going to...

1080
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:09,930
hurt me.

1081
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:11,270
Okay, this is the reason why.

1082
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,150
Because when you reload, you can't move.

1083
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:22,910
And so if I just am trying to dodge something, but I don't need to reload immediately, but it automatically starts reloading, it's going to just like...

1084
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:24,310
keep me there.

1085
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:25,110
You know?

1086
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:26,710
So I think it will actually...

1087
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,750
hurt me more than it will help me.

1088
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:32,370
hurt me more than it will help me.

1089
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:32,470
Dodge.

1090
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:35,010
Okay.

1091
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:37,850
We did it.

1092
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:38,490
We did it.

1093
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,330
And let's grab some better...

1094
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,550
Okay, there's bullets in here.

1095
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,890
But there better also be...

1096
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,110
Someone was like...

1097
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,190
Can't you just know when you have to reload?

1098
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,550
Yeah, but I'm also focusing on other things.

1099
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,230
And sometimes I'm not looking at my gun.

1100
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:56,770
Okay.

1101
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,190
But I will reload right now.

1102
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,070
Okay.

1103
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,410
I only have... They didn't give me a single health pack.

1104
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:07,290
That's so messed up.

1105
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,570
It was my birthday.

1106
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,290
Curry Ninja!

1107
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,370
Happy birthday!

1108
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,290
Happy birthday...

1109
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,110
to you.

1110
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,690
Happy birthday to you.

1111
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,570
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1112
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,350
Happy birthday...

1113
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,210
to you.

1114
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,820
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1115
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,110
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1116
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,510
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1117
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,090
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1118
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:50,110
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1119
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:50,250
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1120
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,810
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1121
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:53,750
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1122
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:00,230
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1123
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:11,660
Happy birthday Curry Ninja.

1124
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,680
There we go.

1125
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,400
Let's run all the way back.

1126
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,600
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1127
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,700
Wait, where was that other room?

1128
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,700
Is it all the way up here?

1129
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,340
There was a... no, wait.

1130
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,700
Wrong way?

1131
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,120
Okay.

1132
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,300
The one that had the other key necessary?

1133
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,680
La la la la la.

1134
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:52,670
Nice.

1135
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,240
They wouldn't put like another...

1136
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,540
Another...

1137
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,140
Oh, this is just like a room room.

1138
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,160
I'm scared.

1139
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,400
Why was this room all locked up though?

1140
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,640
What's in here?

1141
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,820
Oh!

1142
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,300
A mine detector!

1143
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,740
Oh sorry, metal detector.

1144
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,320
Yippee!

1145
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,000
Now we can go through the minefield.

1146
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:44,530
Yes!

1147
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,930
Goodbye creepy area.

1148
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,130
This area was so creepy.

1149
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:49,330
For no reason.

1150
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,230
Why is this area so mysterious?

1151
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,130
What's in here?

1152
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,490
What am I missing?

1153
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,850
Why is it mysterious?

1154
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:04,530
What's in here?

1155
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,350
What's in here?

1156
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,540
Oh, sorry.

1157
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,860
Um...

1158
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,420
Let's try the mine detector.

1159
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,740
Oh, how does this work?

1160
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,580
How does this work?

1161
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:40,590
Oh, I'm s-

1162
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,000
Oh no, they don't stay up.

1163
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:51,460
Oh no, they don't stay up.

1164
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,510
Oh, I can walk in between them?

1165
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:57,710
Oh, I can walk in between them?

1166
00:51:59,410 --> 00:51:59,770
Oh!

1167
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,290
I can't walk in between them.

1168
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,470
Um, this is hard.

1169
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,090
You guys- Wait, how the heck am I supposed to-

1170
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,920
How am I supposed to- How am I supposed to get through?

1171
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,620
How am I supposed to get through?

1172
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:23,300
How

1173
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:36,770
am I supposed to get through?

1174
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,550
We're all over the mine.

1175
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:39,010
Yeah.

1176
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,000
Okay, I think my most viable option was uh...

1177
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,240
Nope.

1178
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,480
Over here.

1179
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,130
Oh my god.

1180
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,770
How did this guy get so far through?

1181
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:04,930
What?

1182
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,170
How did he get so far?

1183
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,890
Oh my gosh, this is stressing me out.

1184
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,390
Guys, this is stressing me out a little bit.

1185
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,950
He was like hopping over everything.

1186
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:21,470
Um...

1187
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,530
Which way?

1188
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,350
Wait, do you guys think I should go left or right?

1189
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,190
Uh, they're both about the same I think.

1190
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:29,810
Oh gosh!

1191
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,490
Oh gosh, I don't know if I can make it through there!

1192
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,450
My dumpy's too thick!

1193
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:39,270
Oh my god.

1194
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:41,370
Okay, wait a minute.

1195
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:42,270
Okay.

1196
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:44,930
Maybe...

1197
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:46,670
Okay.

1198
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:55,680
Okay.

1199
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:00,360
Okay.

1200
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:04,980
I think we made it.

1201
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,160
What's it say?

1202
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:14,800
Wait, is there...

1203
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,180
Oh, there's still some in here, aren't there?

1204
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,360
Oh gosh.

1205
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,440
Don't do this to me.

1206
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:24,520
Ah!

1207
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,060
I want the metal!

1208
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:38,800
Oh

1209
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:43,350
my gosh.

1210
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:43,970
Oh my gosh.

1211
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,860
I'm gonna get it.

1212
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:55,720
Is it a trap though?

1213
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,220
You don't think it's a trap, right?

1214
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,160
Maybe down.

1215
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,020
No.

1216
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,340
Can I squeeze through here?

1217
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,060
Maybe.

1218
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,280
I'm scared!

1219
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,900
Oh, I made it.

1220
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,500
I made it, I made it.

1221
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:27,600
Okay.

1222
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,020
Maybe down.

1223
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,260
I can't see through the tree.

1224
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,470
No, our metal!

1225
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,910
Okay, I'm gonna have to save as soon as we get it.

1226
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,980
I don't even think we went to any height.

1227
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,080
I think we just...

1228
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,440
Oh my gosh.

1229
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,500
I feel like that was close.

1230
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:15,780
Okay.

1231
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:16,600
Let's save.

1232
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:21,390
How do I use it?

1233
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:24,410
Wait, how do I use it again?

1234
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:28,770
Select.

1235
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,650
I selected it.

1236
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,490
It's not letting me save?

1237
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:49,650
Oh wait.

1238
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,620
It's kind of evil that they put some in the trees like that.

1239
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,120
It's kind of evil that they put some in the trees like that.

1240
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,240
Okay, let's go up a little.

1241
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:00,820
Okay, let's go up a little.

1242
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,280
Let's go up this way instead.

1243
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:05,900
Oh gosh.

1244
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:05,980
Oh gosh.

1245
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,700
The sound is annoying me.

1246
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,400
So I'm gonna...

1247
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,820
I'm gonna lower the volume a little bit.

1248
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,200
Oh

1249
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,280
gosh.

1250
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,560
How do I get through?

1251
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,640
You can only pee in a save zone?

1252
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,400
What if I pee up here?

1253
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,020
What if I pee after I...

1254
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,100
What if I pee after I...

1255
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,120
I keep pressing C on accident.

1256
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:38,660
Um...

1257
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,240
No!

1258
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,060
I'm already through though!

1259
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,220
I'm in the safe area!

1260
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:46,600
No!

1261
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,180
From what I can tell, Gunslinger doesn't make you stop when it reloads.

1262
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,680
No way!

1263
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:55,560
Did I...

1264
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,920
Did I screw myself out of that then?

1265
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:04,770
Dang it.

1266
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:06,750
No peeing in the minefield.

1267
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,650
I can't do it while people are watching.

1268
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,890
This one... This area is so...

1269
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:35,570
I can't tell where I can squeeze past and where I can't.

1270
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:36,070
You know?

1271
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,030
It's tough.

1272
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,330
I think maybe they should have clarified like...

1273
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:47,810
Oh, if you pick the reload, you won't stop to reload.

1274
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,210
You know?

1275
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:49,290
Because otherwise I think...

1276
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:52,970
I think more... I think I'm not the only person probably to...

1277
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:53,810
I think I'm not the only person probably to...

1278
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,630
assume that, you know?

1279
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:04,010
Oh my gosh, that was close.

1280
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,090
I... Oh, I wish the...

1281
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,930
range was wider...

1282
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:22,950
for this thing.

1283
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,230
It's actually quite...

1284
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,170
obnoxious.

1285
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,020
It's actually quite...

1286
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
not knowing...

1287
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,900
where I'm like...

1288
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,120
scanning, you know?

1289
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,460
Because I have to go so...

1290
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,380
because I have to go so...

1291
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,480
I'm gonna go down.

1292
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:18,550
No!

1293
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,890
No!

1294
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,330
Why did you save, you game?

1295
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,190
Mines weren't the only threat.

1296
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,930
The jungle was home to ferocious hunters.

1297
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:26,170
The jungle was home to ferocious hunters.

1298
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:26,510
Are you kidding me?

1299
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,810
I noticed the presence of...

1300
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:29,650
Of... of...

1301
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:31,970
Frogs?

1302
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:32,950
Flies?

1303
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:34,510
Uh...

1304
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:36,970
Uh...

1305
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,270
Uh...

1306
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:47,270
Step on a mine to give me...

1307
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,950
fireworks for my birthday.

1308
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:48,310
No!

1309
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:51,870
I'm gonna...

1310
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:53,210
I'm gonna say frogs.

1311
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:55,890
Arrowhead frogs.

1312
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:57,450
It's poison.

1313
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:58,550
Lethal.

1314
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:01,210
A single scratch could make me...

1315
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:01,790
croak.

1316
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,140
You're kidding me.

1317
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,460
You're kidding me right now.

1318
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:17,390
You're kidding me.

1319
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,550
You're kidding me.

1320
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:18,050
Can I shoot them?

1321
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,090
I cannot shoot them.

1322
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,410
Why can't I shoot the frogs?

1323
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:27,830
Why can't I shoot the frogs?

1324
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:29,250
Molotov?

1325
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,130
I think the... No!

1326
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,310
The mines will explode!

1327
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,990
I think the...

1328
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:35,990
No!

1329
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:35,990
The mines will explode!

1330
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:36,690
Oh gosh.

1331
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:40,930
What if I throw the meat?

1332
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:41,330
What if I throw the meat?

1333
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,190
It won't let me throw the meat.

1334
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,660
This is so evil.

1335
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,300
Actually.

1336
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,220
This game might be the most evil game....

1337
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,600
ever.

1338
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,820
And they don't even go in like...

1339
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:02,400
patterns.

1340
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,680
They're random.

1341
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:07,100
There.

1342
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,300
They don't even... Oh my gosh!

1343
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,800
They don't even go in like a pattern.

1344
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,780
If they do, if's a very long pattern.

1345
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,680
If they do, if's a very long pattern.

1346
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,440
I don't think there are mines.

1347
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,720
I think... but he said the landmines, right?

1348
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,120
You know what?

1349
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,300
Okay, I'm just gonna run for it then.

1350
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,000
Oh my gosh.

1351
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,360
I'm stuck on a tree.

1352
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:32,360
Okay.

1353
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:32,700
Yippee!

1354
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,000
Yippee!

1355
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,380
Okay.

1356
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:42,720
Thanks.

1357
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:48,460
We made it somehow.

1358
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,060
Somehow.

1359
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,280
Somehow we made it.

1360
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,000
Oh, never mind.

1361
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,300
Back to the mines.

1362
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,440
No!

1363
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,640
I don't like the mines.

1364
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,480
I don't like the mines.

1365
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,800
I need my little canary.

1366
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,600
Actually it was super easy, barely an inconvenience.

1367
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,440
Shut up!

1368
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,860
Shut up, you!

1369
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:40,640
I don't think it saved after the... after when I got here, so...

1370
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:45,270
Oh gosh.

1371
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,410
But what's up there?

1372
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:57,350
Is there like another path up here?

1373
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:57,690
Wait.

1374
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:02,490
I'm trying to... click on... oh, why did I just do that?

1375
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:05,010
Oh, it won't show my cursor.

1376
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:05,450
Never mind.

1377
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,370
Imagine if the mines were plastic.

1378
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:12,810
I don't think that would make a difference.

1379
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,840
What if I...

1380
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,400
go up here?

1381
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:23,080
Is there anything?

1382
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,000
Am I just being crazy?

1383
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,240
I might be crazy.

1384
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,540
That scared me.

1385
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:30,960
You know what?

1386
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,300
Let's just go.

1387
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,800
I don't care if there's a secret.

1388
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,410
Are there mines in here?

1389
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:42,830
There's no sign.

1390
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:44,770
Maybe I'm safe.

1391
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:46,750
Welcome to the jungle.

1392
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:50,330
Oh, I think I'm safe now.

1393
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:52,270
Oh...

1394
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:56,790
Oh gosh.

1395
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,030
I think I'm gonna get lost in here though.

1396
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,590
You got your firework.

1397
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:01,790
Yeah, there you go, Joshua.

1398
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:05,250
There you go.

1399
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:11,070
Oh!

1400
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:14,030
While wandering through that jungle, I found something.

1401
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:16,170
Or rather, someone.

1402
01:05:16,610 --> 01:05:17,030
Someone?

1403
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,490
Who the hell is that?

1404
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:26,590
I saw the rotten remains of an escaping prisoner.

1405
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:28,450
It had a note.

1406
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:32,030
If you're reading this note, then I'm dead.

1407
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,350
My name is Henry Stanley.

1408
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:35,050
Stanley.

1409
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,370
And I was imprisoned for a crime I didn't commit.

1410
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:38,010
That's just like us.

1411
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,730
Damn, just like me.

1412
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:46,090
After escaping from my cell, I ran away through the sewers then ended up in the Alpha Building.

1413
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:46,730
Just like us!

1414
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:49,750
I finally managed to leave that damn building.

1415
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:50,850
Just like us.

1416
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:52,670
But now I'm lost in this tropical hell.

1417
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:53,410
Just like us.

1418
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:56,630
I've spent thirty years trying to leave this damn jungle.

1419
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:57,490
Thirty years?!

1420
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:57,850
But no luck.

1421
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:00,890
I'm old, and my strength is fading.

1422
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,690
I won't last long.

1423
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,750
These are my last words.

1424
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,810
These were his last words.

1425
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:12,330
Other than the note, there was a compass, but the needle was missing.

1426
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:16,290
A broken compass was useless, so I didn't take it.

1427
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:18,930
You should've...

1428
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:20,910
What do you mean you didn't take it?

1429
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:21,310
Can I...

1430
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:27,900
We won't be like that guy.

1431
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,660
This... this jungle is the easiest thing ever.

1432
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,380
A broken compass is useless.

1433
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,760
So I didn't take it.

1434
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,110
Okay.

1435
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:51,330
I think we're almost out.

1436
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:53,810
Oh, shoot.

1437
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:02,610
These are my last words.

1438
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,190
No!

1439
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:05,130
Wait.

1440
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,610
Now the guy's gonna be...

1441
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:07,270
Another corpse.

1442
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,830
No.

1443
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:09,630
It's the same guy.

1444
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,690
I searched the corpse.

1445
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:16,830
It was also rotting and gripping another compass.

1446
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:19,590
The needle was also missing.

1447
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,730
Someone or something in this jungle was stealing compass needles.

1448
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:27,950
There was a secret pocket in his ragged clothes.

1449
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:28,710
Secret pocket!

1450
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:30,490
Within, I found a note.

1451
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:33,470
If you only found this note...

1452
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,810
... then someone else stole my other note.

1453
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:36,230
Stole my other note!

1454
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:37,550
Another note?

1455
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:51,750
Oh

1456
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:59,810
my god, this game is so stupid.

1457
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:04,290
That's such a good gag, actually.

1458
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,630
That's actually such a good gag.

1459
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,130
No...

1460
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,510
I love it.

1461
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:23,690
I think we're heading back to where we came from.

1462
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,330
I think.

1463
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:34,170
Here's my note.

1464
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:35,770
The other one got stolen.

1465
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,010
Who's stealing?

1466
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:38,190
Who's out here stealing notes?

1467
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:42,310
We don't have any notes in our inventory, so it definitely wasn't us.

1468
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:43,530
Okay.

1469
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:44,390
Okay.

1470
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,430
Looking for a third corpse.

1471
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,410
Are we gonna see him right now?

1472
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:47,290
A third corpse?

1473
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:48,390
Fuck.

1474
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,810
That jungle was more dangerous than I expected.

1475
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,640
Wait, I've searched everywhere, though.

1476
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,580
It was rotting, too.

1477
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,360
Like the others.

1478
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,440
It had a compass on it.

1479
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:09,600
Don't tell me.

1480
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,780
The needle was missing.

1481
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,060
The needle was missing.

1482
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:11,640
Exactly.

1483
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:15,840
Could it be that you were running into the same corpse over and over again?

1484
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,160
I commend you for coming to the same place.

1485
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:19,440
Monty Python rope.

1486
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:19,560
I don't use it.

1487
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,800
I passed by seven times to confirm it.

1488
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,720
I was wandering in circles.

1489
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,940
The damn jungle was toying with me.

1490
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:33,000
I had to orient myself somehow or I'd end up spending thirty years in that maze of trees.

1491
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,800
I tried to direct myself by watching the stars.

1492
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:37,540
The stars.

1493
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:41,760
But the damn top down view only let me see the trees and ground.

1494
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,280
So I had to find another way to gain direction.

1495
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,100
Hmm.

1496
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,710
The compass!

1497
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,590
We finally took the compass!

1498
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,550
We could use anything as a needle, right?

1499
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:19,150
What the hell is that?

1500
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:29,690
Oh!

1501
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,250
What the...

1502
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,850
The rusty wire?

1503
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:37,930
Oh my gosh!

1504
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,730
I think you're a genius!

1505
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:45,910
I think you're a genius!

1506
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:52,470
Ew!

1507
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:06,970
The wire wouldn't have been magnetized.

1508
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,470
How did you expect it to work?

1509
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:12,190
Modern compasses don't need the wire to be magnetized.

1510
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:14,590
Just turns out the compass wasn't modern.

1511
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,050
Oh.

1512
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,450
So it didn't work.

1513
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:19,090
Dang.

1514
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:23,830
Oh.

1515
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,080
That's not where we were!

1516
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,860
I was looking at the compass, thinking of how to make it work.

1517
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:38,360
Wait!

1518
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,740
When something caught my eye.

1519
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,680
In the middle of the grass.

1520
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,280
Something glimmered under the pale moonlight.

1521
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:44,960
The corpse.

1522
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,660
In my peripheral vision.

1523
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,900
I noticed I was not the only one to spot it.

1524
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,480
The corpse.

1525
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,000
Bird!

1526
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,140
Oh my god, no.

1527
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:56,740
Why is this bro so loud?

1528
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,420
What?

1529
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,500
Why did he take it?

1530
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,740
I'm gonna punch that bird.

1531
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:05,900
Wait, um...

1532
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,300
Wait, where did he go?

1533
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,500
Oh, shoot!

1534
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:11,660
Oh my god!

1535
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:11,680
Oh!

1536
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:13,340
Okay.

1537
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,560
We have to go far away.

1538
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,780
And then we have to shoot him.

1539
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:19,800
Dang it.

1540
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,260
Um, meat!

1541
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,560
He wants the meat.

1542
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,880
Ravens are friends of small shiny things.

1543
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,080
Not meat.

1544
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:32,860
Uh...

1545
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:33,440
Coin!

1546
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,040
Shinny things.

1547
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,680
Hey, hey, hey!

1548
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,160
No, no!

1549
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,420
I think we have to lead him over.

1550
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,420
I think we have to...

1551
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,720
How do I...

1552
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,480
Oh!

1553
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,360
The needle!

1554
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:02,800
Yippee!

1555
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:06,020
Alright!

1556
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,740
Now how do we use it?

1557
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:11,480
Weast.

1558
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:13,740
East.

1559
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,120
Oh.

1560
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,680
Wait, do I go west?

1561
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,300
Now I go south.

1562
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:20,360
Okay.

1563
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,680
Go south.

1564
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,260
It's telling me the way, everybody.

1565
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,780
It's telling me the way.

1566
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:29,540
East.

1567
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,040
This is definitely how compasses work.

1568
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:34,820
South.

1569
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,340
This is definitely how compasses work.

1570
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,480
Oh!

1571
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,580
This is where we were before!

1572
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:42,020
Weast.

1573
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:43,920
Okay.

1574
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,520
Make sure we don't get attacked.

1575
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:53,770
Do I need to heal after?

1576
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:54,370
I don't think so.

1577
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:55,530
We just...

1578
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:56,890
That was strange.

1579
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:58,430
Weast.

1580
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,170
Oh, shoot!

1581
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:06,730
Wait!

1582
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:07,710
Did that just ruin my...

1583
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:08,050
Okay, no.

1584
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:08,510
We're good.

1585
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:10,630
Oh!

1586
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:12,230
Vivicore, thanks for the five-gifter!

1587
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:14,550
Oh, thank you!

1588
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:19,850
Nice.

1589
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,120
More bullets?

1590
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:30,600
Okay.

1591
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:31,380
Um...

1592
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,560
South.

1593
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:41,890
Oh my gosh!

1594
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:41,930
Oh my gosh!

1595
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:43,270
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

1596
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,390
I'm gonna heal.

1597
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:53,890
I'm gonna heal real quick.

1598
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,030
There we go.

1599
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:03,830
Let's just heal real quick!

1600
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:05,930
Let's just get our...

1601
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:12,650
Let's just get our health back up and pretty and nice, and...

1602
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:13,670
Ooh!

1603
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:15,850
Sorry, I have my TV on.

1604
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,070
I'm watching advertisements.

1605
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:20,330
Okay, let's go.

1606
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:26,270
Yeah, you want some of that?

1607
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,990
We're going south again.

1608
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,190
There's no guys.

1609
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:42,940
Curious...

1610
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:44,660
Curious...

1611
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,400
We're going east!

1612
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,520
Hi X300, thanks for the five gifted!

1613
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,030
Okay.

1614
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:03,830
We're going...

1615
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:10,570
Okay, we're going north, sorry.

1616
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:14,250
I wasn't...

1617
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:16,530
Oh my gosh.

1618
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:20,450
I know to reload!

1619
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:30,080
Run away!

1620
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,600
Run away!

1621
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:35,750
East!

1622
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,710
Oh my gosh.

1623
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,450
This is like the longest area ever.

1624
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,700
I'm gonna run out of bullets at this rate.

1625
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:59,630
Wait, what was it?

1626
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:00,310
East?

1627
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:00,570
Okay.

1628
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:03,450
Nice suit!

1629
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:15,110
Oh my gosh, we're probably gonna have to face this as like the boss of this area, aren't we?

1630
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,170
Like a big one or something.

1631
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:17,790
Probably.

1632
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,310
North!

1633
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:24,390
Ooh, that was close.

1634
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:29,050
East!

1635
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:33,470
Like a big boss?

1636
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:42,930
I crack myself up.

1637
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:46,330
We're going south!

1638
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:51,920
Wait, can I save in these areas?

1639
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,720
Actually, now that I think about it...

1640
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:57,760
Nice.

1641
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,500
It's probably just good to have a little bit of an area, you know?

1642
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:03,420
Okay.

1643
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:12,720
Uh...

1644
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,320
South!

1645
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,580
These areas, like, kind of mess with me.

1646
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,240
I'm like, is it safe or not?

1647
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,020
West.

1648
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,020
Okay.

1649
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:28,480
West.

1650
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,580
Weest!

1651
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,320
Oh my god, that was close.

1652
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,880
This thing is fast.

1653
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,200
So...

1654
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:44,580
Weest.

1655
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,420
I saw a video with YumeiTara talking about Metal Gear.

1656
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:57,280
Is this the original Metal Gear on NES?

1657
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,180
Or is this something else?

1658
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,740
This is a parody of Metal Gear, actually.

1659
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:04,280
But thanks for watching!

1660
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,800
Mystery area...

1661
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,060
Colonel!

1662
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,340
Why is this a mystery area?

1663
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:19,200
What's here?

1664
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:19,960
What's here?

1665
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,440
What's here?

1666
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,340
We missed the other mystery even!

1667
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,460
We missed the mystery before...

1668
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:34,960
What could the mystery here be?

1669
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,280
Should I call the radio?

1670
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,300
Let's try.

1671
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:38,660
Colonel!

1672
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:49,940
Escape vehicle.

1673
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,420
I sound so tired.

1674
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:53,980
I'll try.

1675
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,980
I'll try, Colonel.

1676
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:14,760
You still here?

1677
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:15,260
Yep.

1678
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:16,280
Haha.

1679
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:23,360
Does anyone know?

1680
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,860
I'm so curious, like what you're supposed to do in this area.

1681
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:27,560
What do I have?

1682
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:29,820
Have eyeballs?

1683
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,360
Oh my god, I can't see anything.

1684
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,600
The sunglasses at night?

1685
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,660
Don't do anything, you guys.

1686
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,540
Punch the tree?

1687
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:50,990
Oh!

1688
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:51,930
Oh!

1689
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:52,010
Oh!

1690
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:53,170
What?

1691
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,000
Oh my god.

1692
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:06,420
That actually worked.

1693
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:07,160
Platoon!

1694
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,140
Attention!

1695
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:09,080
Attention!

1696
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,140
Are you ladies the new recruits?

1697
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,260
Yes sir!

1698
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:14,260
Fuck you, the saddest bunch I've ever met.

1699
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:17,600
And I've seen stacks of shit taller than you are.

1700
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,360
Saddest bunch I've ever met.

1701
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:23,400
You think you're my soul because you stuck your dicks in god knows what hole?

1702
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:27,060
I'm going to beat you shit stacks into weapons of war!

1703
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:29,460
Even if it kills you!

1704
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,720
Where are you from, boy?

1705
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,280
From Minnesota, sir.

1706
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:35,300
Minnesota?

1707
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,800
Only two things come out of Minnesota.

1708
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,200
Men and soda.

1709
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,140
I don't see you bubbling, so you must be a min.

1710
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,660
What's a min, sir?

1711
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:49,200
Do I look like a scientist to you, pissant?

1712
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,500
Sir, no sir.

1713
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:54,040
You're not worth an urban dictionary entry, shit stain.

1714
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,000
Hahaha.

1715
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,680
What do you do at night, scumbag?

1716
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,240
I sleep, sir.

1717
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:00,260
Sleep!

1718
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,120
Will they see me?

1719
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,980
Well, excuse me, princess.

1720
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,440
Does she need a wheel map?

1721
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,280
Oh my god, what a reference.

1722
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,840
Excuse me, princess.

1723
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:12,380
We train.

1724
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,280
We go the extra mile.

1725
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:15,940
When do we sleep, sir?

1726
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,440
During your break time, your highness.

1727
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,960
But sir, it's a 15 minute break.

1728
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,000
Then sleep fast, fuck!

1729
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:23,940
Hahaha.

1730
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:24,900
Yes, sir.

1731
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,800
What the fuck happened to your eyebrows?

1732
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,480
They're shaped, sir.

1733
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,200
They're shaped?

1734
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:30,980
Are you kidding me?

1735
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,040
Do you think they'll see me?

1736
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,180
Are you the bitch of the yard?

1737
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,660
Sir, it's personal hygiene, sir.

1738
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,480
Oh.

1739
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,460
Sir, I saw someone behind the fence.

1740
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,020
No you didn't.

1741
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,080
They're gone!

1742
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:47,360
Next group!

1743
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,740
Oh, they're all coming back.

1744
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,220
I guess I'm from Minnesota.

1745
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:53,700
Attention!

1746
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,800
Are you ladies the new recruits?

1747
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:57,820
They're back, they're back.

1748
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,860
Fuck, you're the saddest bunch I've ever met.

1749
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,220
And I've seen stacks of shit taller than you are.

1750
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:08,820
You think you're macho because you stuck your dicks in god knows what hole.

1751
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:12,480
I'm going to beat you shit stacks into weapons of war.

1752
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,760
Even if it kills you.

1753
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:15,620
Oh, I think I missed it.

1754
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,260
Where are you from, boy?

1755
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:19,460
I think I missed whatever that was.

1756
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,700
I thought it was going to be an actual alert.

1757
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:21,320
Oh no!

1758
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,240
Only two things come out of Minnesota.

1759
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:26,540
Min and soda.

1760
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:27,660
Why is everybody from Minnesota?

1761
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,480
I don't see you bubbling, so you must be a min.

1762
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:30,960
What's a min, sir?

1763
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,440
Do I look like a scientist to you, pissant?

1764
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:41,040
I arrived at what looked like the exit of a barracks.

1765
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:41,500
Pissant.

1766
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:43,420
What looked like the what?

1767
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,360
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

1768
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,240
Oh.

1769
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:46,440
Oh.

1770
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:47,520
Mike!

1771
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:49,140
Mike!

1772
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:51,300
Are you going to open the door?

1773
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,160
Are you going to open the damn door or not?

1774
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,080
Hold on, I'm opening it.

1775
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,880
My instinct told me the gate was going to open and a truck was going to leave.

1776
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:03,000
I could sneak onto the truck and get far away from here.

1777
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:03,500
His instincts.

1778
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:05,880
Oh, here I go.

1779
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:06,660
See you later.

1780
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,480
Skip!

1781
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,040
Yo, Mike!

1782
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:08,960
Mike!

1783
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:09,820
Mike!

1784
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:10,860
What's up?

1785
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,220
Hold on.

1786
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,960
I need to verify the departure permit.

1787
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,420
Fuck, Mike!

1788
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,060
Hurry up!

1789
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:17,660
Oh my god.

1790
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,600
Yeah, yeah.

1791
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:22,160
Oh, I can get in.

1792
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:23,540
There you go.

1793
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:24,420
Sneak into the truck.

1794
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:26,540
That was so easy.

1795
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:31,080
Yeah, yeah.

1796
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:31,800
I did it.

1797
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:32,820
Yo, Mike!

1798
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:33,540
Mike!

1799
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,400
Can I leave now?

1800
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:35,820
Negative.

1801
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:36,660
Negative?

1802
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,400
The lieutenant canceled the delivery.

1803
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:39,340
No way.

1804
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:40,640
You'll have to come back in.

1805
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,660
Oh, holy fuck.

1806
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:43,420
No!

1807
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,580
Oh my gosh.

1808
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:45,340
No, we just left.

1809
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:45,740
Please.

1810
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:47,800
Ow!

1811
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:54,380
Oh my gosh.

1812
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,540
Stage complete.

1813
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:58,400
There are two more secrets.

1814
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,460
Wait, I got one secret.

1815
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,940
Or, well, I know the tree was a secret, but what was the other secret?

1816
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,140
Interesting.

1817
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,300
The barracks.

1818
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,800
The trip was shorter than expected.

1819
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:17,470
Oh my god.

1820
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:21,110
Instead of heading away, I ended up inside the compound.

1821
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:22,050
How is this happening?

1822
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:26,110
The ground was muddy, beaten lifeless by countless people.

1823
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:27,270
There were countless combat boots.

1824
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:28,950
There's gonna be tons of guys here.

1825
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:31,670
There were sandbags and boxes everywhere.

1826
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:32,330
Everywhere.

1827
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:34,510
Whoa.

1828
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:35,350
He was a jerk.

1829
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:38,330
I heard Mike getting off the truck and talking to the other Mike.

1830
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:39,930
Why are they all named Mike?

1831
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:42,950
Hey Mike, what the hell happened?

1832
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:45,930
Someone screwed up and loaded the wrong stuff.

1833
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:47,930
Useless fuckwads.

1834
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:48,430
Ooh.

1835
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:51,470
They reported that they'll get the correct stuff loaded soon.

1836
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:52,030
Okay.

1837
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:53,790
Sounds like a nap is in order.

1838
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:55,030
No can do.

1839
01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:58,910
North parking lot.

1840
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:00,190
233.

1841
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:02,450
Okay.

1842
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:13,490
These guys have such potty mouths.

1843
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:21,450
We got another truck.

1844
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:22,770
Our instinct.

1845
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:26,790
North gate without being seen.

1846
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:27,410
Okay.

1847
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,250
Alright, let's go to the north gate.

1848
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,010
Where's my chloroform?

1849
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:37,790
Oh.

1850
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:41,090
Let's select you.

1851
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:44,250
And I guess we don't need that anymore.

1852
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:47,450
But we'll just do the bandage for now.

1853
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:50,990
Okay.

1854
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:52,050
I'm gonna get this guy.

1855
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:53,050
I'm gonna get this guy.

1856
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,380
If I can.

1857
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:06,140
I don't know his pattern yet.

1858
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:07,680
Are you gonna walk down now?

1859
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,380
Oh.

1860
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:12,540
Never mind.

1861
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:13,300
I still got him.

1862
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,660
I was gonna chloroform him, but I forgot to press space.

1863
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:18,480
He doesn't have anything?

1864
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:19,740
You useless?

1865
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:26,660
Binoculars.

1866
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:27,140
Interesting.

1867
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:30,720
Alright.

1868
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:32,340
That's all the good stuff.

1869
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,560
Doctor's gonna be so mad.

1870
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:35,900
I mean...

1871
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:40,340
Even if I had put him to sleep, he still would have gotten to...

1872
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:44,490
Die truck.

1873
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:47,550
If I put him to sleep, he still probably would have...

1874
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:48,990
You know?

1875
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:52,050
Would have gotten to...

1876
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:52,870
He would have been like, I fell asleep.

1877
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:55,170
No...

1878
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:57,270
Oh my gosh.

1879
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,310
I had to be careful not to be seen.

1880
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,230
Oh my god.

1881
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:05,970
Did that guy see me?

1882
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,200
I pressed...

1883
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,840
I just neutralized a soldier, but I couldn't leave him in sight.

1884
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:17,540
I just...

1885
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:21,200
Those platoons could pass by, see him, and raise the alarm.

1886
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:22,040
Those platoons could pass by, see him, and raise the alarm.

1887
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:22,420
But I pressed space!

1888
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:28,480
So I made sure to carry the soldiers I neutralized, hiding them elsewhere, out of sight of those patrols.

1889
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:28,620
So I made sure to carry the soldiers I neutralized, hiding them elsewhere, out of sight of those patrols.

1890
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,260
I pressed space!

1891
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,540
I knocked guards inside buildings.

1892
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,200
Well, hold on.

1893
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:36,300
Oh, inside buildings?

1894
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:37,940
Okay.

1895
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,120
It said press X.

1896
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:43,000
Yeah, but I wasn't trying to do that.

1897
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:43,880
I didn't want to punch him.

1898
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,100
I pressed space because I wanted a chloroform.

1899
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:50,680
I pressed space because I wanted a chloroform.

1900
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,580
Oh my god.

1901
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,760
They're not coming this way, right?

1902
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:01,300
You guys aren't understanding my point!

1903
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:04,080
I know it said press X, but I want it to stop.

1904
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,120
I pressed space instead of X!

1905
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,300
You're not understanding my point.

1906
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:13,310
It is space though, right?

1907
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:14,510
To use the chloroform.

1908
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:18,650
They're not going to notice the blood, right?

1909
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:27,950
We choose not to understand.

1910
01:29:29,150 --> 01:29:31,490
What if I take all these guys out one by one?

1911
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:32,390
No

1912
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,130
one can use.

1913
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:49,530
Yeah!

1914
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,050
Meat, cheese, fries, mince, thighs.

1915
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:53,890
Welcome to membership.

1916
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:55,150
Thank you.

1917
01:29:57,290 --> 01:29:57,810
Okay.

1918
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:00,810
Oh, oh shit.

1919
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:01,190
They're coming.

1920
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:05,790
There they are.

1921
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:06,810
All those guys.

1922
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:08,870
And there they go.

1923
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:09,850
All those guys.

1924
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:12,230
Wow, they're kind of fast though, aren't they?

1925
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:22,350
No one ever uses the bathroom.

1926
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:24,490
They'll never notice.

1927
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:27,630
And he's got nothing on him.

1928
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,830
Stingy.

1929
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:31,750
Oh shoot.

1930
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:32,150
Oh shoot.

1931
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:32,450
Oh shoot.

1932
01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:32,750
Oh shoot.

1933
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:33,030
Oh shoot.

1934
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,270
Oh shoot.

1935
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:33,390
Oh shoot.

1936
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:33,530
Oh shoot.

1937
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:35,310
Nice.

1938
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:41,590
Hey you.

1939
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:42,490
Hey you.

1940
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:43,930
Hey you.

1941
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:43,930
Thank you.

1942
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:46,090
What's this?

1943
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:47,270
Bullet slot.

1944
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:47,870
Nice!

1945
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:59,680
Oh gosh, this one's gonna be tricky though.

1946
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:02,320
I think.

1947
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:06,220
Because those guys are gonna come back!

1948
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,160
Oh no.

1949
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:10,940
Oh no no no no no!

1950
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,340
Okay, actually, this works.

1951
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,520
Oh wow!

1952
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,040
We haven't gotten any depleted uranium in a while.

1953
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:21,740
More bullet slot.

1954
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:22,080
Okay.

1955
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,780
But they don't come in here, right?

1956
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:30,440
They don't come this side.

1957
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:37,800
Okay.

1958
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,120
We'll wait for them to come around.

1959
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:44,020
To do their little round, and then we'll get the guy on the right.

1960
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:46,880
Okay.

1961
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,770
Okay.

1962
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:52,950
And then they're gonna go up.

1963
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:54,130
I think.

1964
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:55,490
I think they're gone.

1965
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:57,190
Probably.

1966
01:32:01,330 --> 01:32:01,710
Um.

1967
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:02,890
Uh.

1968
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:03,870
Oh.

1969
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:06,270
Like I need a gun.

1970
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:12,800
There we go.

1971
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,520
Okay, perfect.

1972
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:14,520
Cool.

1973
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,360
But we can't let him die.

1974
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:17,020
Don't worry!

1975
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:17,720
We won't let him die.

1976
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,060
Don't worry!

1977
01:32:22,820 --> 01:32:23,200
Oh.

1978
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:25,680
He's fine.

1979
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,320
Oh shit.

1980
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:26,900
Oh shit.

1981
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:27,320
Oh shit.

1982
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:27,900
You guys.

1983
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:28,640
I think it's over.

1984
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:29,500
I think it's over.

1985
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,000
I think it's over.

1986
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:33,970
Um.

1987
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:45,250
I think I found a loophole.

1988
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:52,090
Hey.

1989
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,610
Why are there so many guys?

1990
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:57,090
Call Colonel.

1991
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:57,470
I guess.

1992
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:57,710
Colonel.

1993
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,650
Still there?

1994
01:32:59,590 --> 01:32:59,950
Affirmative.

1995
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:00,650
Where are you?

1996
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:02,490
I'm still in the compound.

1997
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,550
What?

1998
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:05,890
Weren't you escaping in a truck?

1999
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:08,390
What the hell are you doing back there?

2000
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:13,310
I snuck onto a truck, but it went backwards and returned to the compound.

2001
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:15,350
Oh damn it, Fox.

2002
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:16,490
Colonel.

2003
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:19,570
I know about another truck that's going to leave in a while.

2004
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:21,190
I'll call you later.

2005
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:21,970
Call you later.

2006
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:22,330
I'll run out.

2007
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:25,870
Are you streaming tomorrow?

2008
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:28,970
It's my birthday, so I wanted to know if I could get a chew in case you are it.

2009
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:32,230
What is this request?

2010
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:33,370
A chew?

2011
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:36,210
Um.

2012
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:38,270
I think I'm streaming tomorrow.

2013
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:42,110
I have to double check my calendar.

2014
01:33:42,570 --> 01:33:45,170
I have to make my streaming schedule.

2015
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:46,370
Sorry.

2016
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:51,940
I don't know why I'm coughing.

2017
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:52,320
Oh.

2018
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,260
Jacker here.

2019
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:53,860
Who the hell?

2020
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:54,080
Ghost.

2021
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:54,900
Do you copy?

2022
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:56,220
Who the hell are you?

2023
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,120
Jacker?

2024
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:57,160
Huh?

2025
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,260
Who are you?

2026
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,700
Where is Ghost?

2027
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,440
I'm Ghost.

2028
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:01,560
I don't know who that is.

2029
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:03,660
I think you got the wrong channel.

2030
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:04,500
Oops.

2031
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,960
Ugin must have been tampering with the communicator.

2032
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:08,520
Damn geeks.

2033
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:09,700
Over and out.

2034
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,280
What the?

2035
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:10,980
Who are you?

2036
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:16,780
Just in case though.

2037
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,160
Just in case I'm not streaming.

2038
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,560
I'm pretty sure I am.

2039
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,440
But just in case I'm not.

2040
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:25,300
Happy birthday Michi's thigh.

2041
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,000
Wait.

2042
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:27,500
Michi's fries.

2043
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,600
Men's thighs.

2044
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:29,000
Right?

2045
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:31,940
Thank you.

2046
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:32,280
Thank you.

2047
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:36,960
Where is Ghost?

2048
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:37,740
I am Ghost.

2049
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,240
Wait.

2050
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,240
Are they coming back?

2051
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,020
There's so many guys here.

2052
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,680
No way.

2053
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,440
Inside that barrack there were some guards.

2054
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:05,220
I didn't see them because they were sitting behind some bunk beds.

2055
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,360
Slipping out of guard duty.

2056
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,080
Or running around the compound.

2057
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,260
Or worse.

2058
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:11,480
I don't know if I'm in trouble or not.

2059
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:15,400
But thanks to my extraordinary hearing acuity, I could hear their conversation.

2060
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:20,820
Okay, when you enter the dungeon, two skeletons with rusty axes block your way.

2061
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,320
Are they playing D&D?

2062
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:26,040
The eerie red light that glimmers in their eye sockets watches you fixedly.

2063
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,420
What do you do?

2064
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,180
I load my elven bowl and shoot.

2065
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:30,920
Hang on.

2066
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:34,140
Are you really shooting an arrow at a monster that can't believe?

2067
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,500
What do you think will happen?

2068
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:38,760
That the arrow gets stuck between its ribs and slows it down?

2069
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:39,460
Man, why not?

2070
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,600
Someone just walked in.

2071
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:42,320
Fuck.

2072
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:43,980
It must be the drill sergeant.

2073
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:44,320
Quick.

2074
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,220
Hide yourselves.

2075
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:56,710
You guys, I'm in trouble.

2076
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:57,610
Dang it.

2077
01:35:58,510 --> 01:35:59,050
Wait.

2078
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,700
I'm far away, aren't I?

2079
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:08,000
No way.

2080
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:11,740
No!

2081
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,580
My gosh.

2082
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:13,980
No!

2083
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:37,260
Oh, hello.

2084
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,820
It's caught on the door.

2085
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:40,420
There you go.

2086
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,460
What if I destroy their beds even?

2087
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:45,000
Oh, I can!

2088
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:46,180
Yeah!

2089
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:46,440
Yeah!

2090
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:46,920
Yeah!

2091
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:47,740
Destroy it all!

2092
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:48,420
Destroy it all!

2093
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:53,180
No one's sleeping in here tonight!

2094
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,680
You can move in chloroforming.

2095
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:08,540
You can?

2096
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:09,360
Okay.

2097
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:10,060
Good to know.

2098
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:10,540
Thank you.

2099
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:16,670
Oh, they're coming.

2100
01:37:24,730 --> 01:37:26,490
I just... Let's just restart.

2101
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:42,340
I didn't even get shot.

2102
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:44,520
I don't know what happened.

2103
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:46,420
Oh, wait.

2104
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:47,120
They're gonna come out.

2105
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:48,760
They're gonna come.

2106
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:49,980
They're gonna be right here.

2107
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,620
They're gonna be right here.

2108
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,460
There they are.

2109
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:01,080
And there they go.

2110
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:01,960
Okay.

2111
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:04,780
Oh, I bled out?

2112
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:05,140
Oh.

2113
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,300
There it is.

2114
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,160
Nice.

2115
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,420
Was that karma for destroying all their beds, maybe?

2116
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:21,060
You think?

2117
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:24,240
I think it was karma for destroying all their beds.

2118
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:25,940
I'm so sorry.

2119
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:30,440
Oh my gosh.

2120
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,120
That was insane.

2121
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:49,820
Wait.

2122
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:50,940
Why aren't they leaving?

2123
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,760
Why aren't they leaving?

2124
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:55,780
They're all just hanging around out here.

2125
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:56,540
Uh-oh.

2126
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:56,680
Oh...

2127
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:56,720
Oh, no.

2128
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:00,060
Leave!

2129
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:07,020
No way.

2130
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,520
No way.

2131
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,240
Why aren't they leaving?

2132
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:23,790
I guess let me see what happens if I go out.

2133
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:32,040
This area is kind of painful, isn't it?

2134
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:33,980
They were just camping me.

2135
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:35,040
Okay.

2136
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,320
Okay, I have to wait for them to go.

2137
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:38,820
Oh my gosh.

2138
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:44,990
Why did you just stand there?

2139
01:39:45,110 --> 01:39:48,110
Once you're caught, you can't really get out of an alert.

2140
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:49,090
Like it's either...

2141
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:51,210
The game is just don't get caught.

2142
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:52,270
It's not like a...

2143
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:53,610
It's not like Metal Gear.

2144
01:39:53,870 --> 01:39:55,590
It's really just don't get caught.

2145
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:57,010
Okay.

2146
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:17,370
I don't know where they are though, so I'll just wait for the red arrows.

2147
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:20,890
Okay, there we go.

2148
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,170
Oh, the binoculars?

2149
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:22,770
That's so true.

2150
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,790
We haven't seen them...

2151
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:25,890
Use them to see further, unless it's backwards.

2152
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:28,710
What?

2153
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,340
Sticking to the wall camouflage thing?

2154
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,200
Well, that's the thing.

2155
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:47,500
Is I've been sticking to some stuff.

2156
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:50,420
And I think it's only when he like lays flat, right?

2157
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:52,500
Because...

2158
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,320
Because there were some times...

2159
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,100
Where...

2160
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:58,400
Like...

2161
01:40:58,900 --> 01:40:59,700
Like this...

2162
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:01,160
This wouldn't count, right?

2163
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:02,160
You know, like...

2164
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,080
This doesn't count.

2165
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,820
I think he has to lay flat against the wall.

2166
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,760
Which makes it a little tricky.

2167
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:14,040
And also against...

2168
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:14,660
Not certain...

2169
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:15,400
Like this wouldn't work.

2170
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:16,300
Right?

2171
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,340
I think it's only walls.

2172
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:18,140
I think I...

2173
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:19,200
I think I...

2174
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,240
I think I...

2175
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,080
Scammed myself.

2176
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,820
I think I scammed myself truly.

2177
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:28,300
Okay, let's see.

2178
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,460
Let's wait for these guys to go down...

2179
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:32,820
And around.

2180
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,200
Okay, here they are.

2181
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:36,830
And there they...

2182
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:39,760
Go?

2183
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:55,770
Oh my gosh.

2184
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:56,070
No!

2185
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:58,090
I lost the timing because that guy.

2186
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:03,170
The Angry Doritos.

2187
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:12,760
Okay, don't turn around.

2188
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:14,520
Where is he?

2189
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,060
I don't know.

2190
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:23,090
Yeah, there you go.

2191
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:25,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2192
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,890
There you go, yeah.

2193
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:28,730
There you go, yeah.

2194
01:42:29,450 --> 01:42:30,530
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

2195
01:42:31,170 --> 01:42:33,890
Once I get the next guy too, I'll save.

2196
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:38,150
Good.

2197
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:40,650
There they go.

2198
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:43,110
There they run away.

2199
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:46,110
There they go.

2200
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:53,240
There we go, there we go.

2201
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:54,460
Yeah.

2202
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:57,440
There we go.

2203
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:58,900
Oh.

2204
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:02,940
I'm Ghost!

2205
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:06,220
What is this a reference to?

2206
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:14,440
Boogan.

2207
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:19,020
Pull

2208
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:22,430
this.

2209
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:26,030
Okay.

2210
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:27,630
Destroy.

2211
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:30,930
Okie dokie.

2212
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:32,290
Now I'm gonna save.

2213
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:36,630
Cool.

2214
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:38,450
Alright, that's a good place to save.

2215
01:43:39,810 --> 01:43:40,250
Actually...

2216
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:46,230
I was gonna say I could go empty it like right away, but then what would be the point, you know?

2217
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:48,990
I don't understand this.

2218
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:52,950
Oh!

2219
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:53,610
Oh!

2220
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:56,290
Interesting.

2221
01:43:57,690 --> 01:43:59,450
That guy stands covered by a...

2222
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:02,950
Ohoho!

2223
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:04,470
Here they come.

2224
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:05,750
And I can see when they're coming!

2225
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:09,470
Interesting.

2226
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:11,190
Whoa!

2227
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:16,510
This part is very tricky.

2228
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:17,430
I'll be honest.

2229
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:19,690
It ain't easy.

2230
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:20,930
But you're intriguing.

2231
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:23,770
There they go!

2232
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:26,650
You can see their running path even.

2233
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:27,510
I just noticed.

2234
01:44:37,130 --> 01:44:37,570
Yes!

2235
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:41,110
Okay.

2236
01:44:43,370 --> 01:44:44,010
Okie dokie.

2237
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:46,710
Okay, nice.

2238
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:50,330
But you can't use it indoors, which kind of sucks.

2239
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:53,610
Only outdoors.

2240
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,540
And our guy...

2241
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:03,180
Once he turns around...

2242
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,220
Oh, he's heading... Okay.

2243
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,760
I think I can get his butt now.

2244
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:13,290
Okay!

2245
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:16,930
Whoever taught me that you can move while doing the chloroform?

2246
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:18,730
I owe you.

2247
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:21,530
I owe you.

2248
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:27,170
Binoculars aren't usually useful indoors, Minto.

2249
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:28,350
Look, okay.

2250
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:31,650
You have a valid point.

2251
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:40,740
If I go inside this room...

2252
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:45,720
I kind of want to use the bathroom though.

2253
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:47,280
Okay, I'm going to use the bathroom.

2254
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:49,980
In game, not in real life.

2255
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:00,920
I want to save.

2256
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:02,700
I want to save.

2257
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:07,020
I want to save where I'm at.

2258
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:18,820
There we go, okay.

2259
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,280
Okay.

2260
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:22,920
There we go.

2261
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:24,780
Hold on.

2262
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:30,780
There we go.

2263
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,500
Don't be a wierd.

2264
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:37,960
Okay.

2265
01:46:38,740 --> 01:46:39,480
Okay, here we go.

2266
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:42,800
We let them run away.

2267
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:44,040
Yeah.

2268
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:48,380
How do I get this guy?

2269
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:52,980
No, I wanted to screenshot it.

2270
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:53,340
Oh my god.

2271
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:56,980
Oh see, like now it works.

2272
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,100
See how I'm pressed against the box?

2273
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,060
Maybe I can get him right now.

2274
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:05,200
Oh, I'm bleeding out.

2275
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:05,680
I'm bleeding out.

2276
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:06,060
Ah!

2277
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:09,600
And...

2278
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,580
Oh, shoot.

2279
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:13,060
V...

2280
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,180
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

2281
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:15,640
You guys, I think I'm done, though.

2282
01:47:17,980 --> 01:47:18,680
Never mind.

2283
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,860
Inside that barrack, there were some guards.

2284
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:28,580
I didn't see them because they were sitting behind some bunk beds.

2285
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:33,680
Slipping out of guard duty or running around the compound were worse.

2286
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:38,700
But thanks to my extraordinary hearing acuity, I could hear their conversation.

2287
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:39,200
Aha!

2288
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:41,140
Okay, when you enter the dungeon...

2289
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:42,080
Okay, I'm gonna skip this.

2290
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,020
...two skeletons with rusty...

2291
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,240
Someone just walked in.

2292
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:45,940
Fuck.

2293
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,540
It must be the drill sergeant.

2294
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:47,700
Okay.

2295
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:50,920
The ghost call is a reference to one of the dev's other games, Ghost.

2296
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:52,180
A Metroidvania.

2297
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:53,520
Ah, I see, I see.

2298
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:56,560
Um, for this part...

2299
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:58,780
I will save, actually.

2300
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:00,680
Because... well, can I?

2301
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:01,640
Oh, I can't.

2302
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,300
Okay, just kidding.

2303
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:05,860
Um... I... I want to get the stuff.

2304
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:07,860
But if I walk past them...

2305
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:13,240
I can't get that other box over there, right?

2306
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:14,640
Or I just can't touch them, maybe.

2307
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:35,550
There's a bathroom right there!

2308
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,880
As I walked in, I ran into a soldier.

2309
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,460
Wait, no, no, no, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

2310
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:51,380
Oh, am I good?

2311
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:52,060
Wait.

2312
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,740
I think I'm good.

2313
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:58,880
You guys, I think I'm...

2314
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:01,960
Wait, but I skipped a scene!

2315
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,760
Because I thought I was dead.

2316
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,060
I skipped a scene.

2317
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:08,840
I thought I was dead.

2318
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,280
But now I don't know what's going...

2319
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:15,670
Um...

2320
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:17,190
Um...

2321
01:49:18,190 --> 01:49:19,210
I thought I was dead.

2322
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:22,170
I didn't want to... I didn't want to watch it and then die, you know?

2323
01:49:24,530 --> 01:49:25,790
A little last party.

2324
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:33,770
I just saved the game.

2325
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:42,300
I'll just watch the screen.

2326
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,300
I'll just watch it later on YouTube.

2327
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:48,940
Hold on.

2328
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,020
If I load last party...

2329
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,020
Oh, wait.

2330
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:57,040
Oh, it actually did work.

2331
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:57,220
No!

2332
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:58,960
But I have to redo this part!

2333
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:00,620
Oh, come on.

2334
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:01,920
That's so lame.

2335
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,000
My master of stealthiness.

2336
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:16,940
That was a master of stealth, you guys!

2337
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:21,420
But you know what?

2338
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:22,220
I guess this is fine.

2339
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,360
Preserve the game, you know?

2340
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:28,540
Self-sabotage.

2341
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:29,060
It's okay.

2342
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:29,860
It's okay.

2343
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:31,840
It's okay.

2344
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:32,440
It's okay.

2345
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:33,420
We can do this part.

2346
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:34,220
It's no problem.

2347
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:35,580
It's all good.

2348
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:37,200
It's all good.

2349
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:41,560
It's all good.

2350
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:42,380
It's all good.

2351
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:45,220
We weren't that far behind.

2352
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,760
I think I actually went and saved, like, after this.

2353
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:52,020
At the actual... I thought it would do the actual party that I was in earlier.

2354
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,360
I went and saved at the actual party.

2355
01:50:58,220 --> 01:50:58,660
Weird.

2356
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:05,530
In fact, we can go now.

2357
01:51:05,890 --> 01:51:06,330
Wait.

2358
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:09,330
Yeah, because we still have the full party here.

2359
01:51:11,670 --> 01:51:12,730
Oh, no, no, no.

2360
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:13,530
That's not what I wanted to do.

2361
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:15,710
Oh, here they come.

2362
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:20,960
So there's like two groups of guys running around.

2363
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:24,800
Party override.

2364
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:30,870
Yeah, okay.

2365
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:33,730
So the D&D guys, we just can't go up there at all.

2366
01:51:33,850 --> 01:51:34,790
I've learned my lesson.

2367
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:36,630
I thought maybe even if I like...

2368
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:38,530
What's the word?

2369
01:51:38,530 --> 01:51:41,070
If I try not to touch them or anything, you know?

2370
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:44,310
I thought maybe the first time I accidentally, like, touched them.

2371
01:51:44,830 --> 01:51:45,710
But I didn't.

2372
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:47,550
So now I learned my lesson.

2373
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:48,630
Don't be greedy.

2374
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:49,370
Something something.

2375
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:51,470
Mei Ling was right.

2376
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:54,710
Holy moly.

2377
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:57,050
Okay.

2378
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:12,260
They don't even suspect that...

2379
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,880
Someone goes missing every time.

2380
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:26,080
They don't even suspect that a guard goes missing.

2381
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,200
The guys running, they're just too busy running, you know?

2382
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:30,680
Okay.

2383
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:31,480
Here we go.

2384
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:33,760
All right.

2385
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:36,040
But I can at least take the uranium.

2386
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:39,380
I can at least get this.

2387
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:40,940
Oh.

2388
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:43,560
We'll take that.

2389
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:46,340
And wait for the guys to pass again.

2390
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:54,110
At the end, you guys don't trigger a full-on alert?

2391
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:55,630
Are you sure?

2392
01:52:57,590 --> 01:52:58,670
I'm too nervous.

2393
01:52:59,130 --> 01:53:00,030
What's in that crate?

2394
01:53:00,330 --> 01:53:01,190
What if it's something I need?

2395
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,030
I can't shoot all of them because...

2396
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:12,910
They would get injured and then I'll lose the game.

2397
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:14,810
I can't heal all of them.

2398
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:17,350
I mean, I have five health kits, but that's for me.

2399
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:18,410
I'm greedy.

2400
01:53:19,950 --> 01:53:20,390
Molotov?

2401
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:20,610
No.

2402
01:53:20,650 --> 01:53:22,770
If I kill the guys, I lose the game.

2403
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:24,470
I actually game over if you...

2404
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:27,710
If you kill people, you actually lose the game.

2405
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:31,790
I can't save here.

2406
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:32,650
I tried before.

2407
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:33,610
See?

2408
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:36,990
So...

2409
01:53:36,990 --> 01:53:37,950
I could...

2410
01:53:37,950 --> 01:53:38,230
Hold on.

2411
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:41,170
Oh my gosh.

2412
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:41,810
Oh my gosh.

2413
01:53:46,290 --> 01:53:47,610
Waiting for them to leave?

2414
01:53:49,530 --> 01:53:51,030
I'll go save in another room.

2415
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:54,850
Maybe...

2416
01:53:54,850 --> 01:53:55,950
What if I can save here?

2417
01:53:58,090 --> 01:53:59,170
It worked.

2418
01:53:59,430 --> 01:53:59,910
OK.

2419
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:03,730
Let's see.

2420
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:05,630
How do we want to do this?

2421
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:08,590
You don't enjoy the killing all that much.

2422
01:54:10,370 --> 01:54:11,530
Alexis, welcome back.

2423
01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:12,030
Thank you.

2424
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:15,310
Let's just have this on hand, I suppose.

2425
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:17,530
And...

2426
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:21,510
Watch there be nothing of value in...

2427
01:54:23,710 --> 01:54:24,270
In...

2428
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:27,030
That box.

2429
01:54:27,450 --> 01:54:29,530
There's going to be nothing of value, probably.

2430
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:32,230
How do they know it's me?

2431
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:40,170
It's not like I just died.

2432
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:41,810
Oh.

2433
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:43,490
Oh.

2434
01:54:45,530 --> 01:54:46,190
No.

2435
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:48,110
I didn't...

2436
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:55,080
Oh my god.

2437
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:58,520
Wait.

2438
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:00,860
Where am I supposed to take this guy?

2439
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:02,820
Oh, shoot.

2440
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:04,300
The building is fa...

2441
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:05,100
Oh no!

2442
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:06,540
Guys, we are not going to make it.

2443
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:08,380
Escape.

2444
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:09,200
Escaping prisoner.

2445
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:09,820
Stay back.

2446
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:13,780
I got the star for it.

2447
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,040
What do I do?

2448
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:20,980
What do I do with that guy?

2449
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,460
What do I do with him?

2450
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:35,660
I don't think they'll see me here.

2451
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:40,540
Maybe I hide him behind the crates instead?

2452
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,760
I don't think they'll see him behind the crates.

2453
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:06,260
Like right here?

2454
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:08,680
Maybe they won't notice.

2455
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:17,270
Let's see.

2456
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:19,210
Let's see if they notice me.

2457
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:34,990
Alright, washroom man.

2458
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,200
You're getting washroomed.

2459
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:47,860
Let me use the body.

2460
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:51,400
What?

2461
01:56:58,880 --> 01:56:59,360
Oh!

2462
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,140
The guy!

2463
01:57:04,780 --> 01:57:07,060
The guy that I left behind the thing.

2464
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,480
Oh my gosh, so I actually can't save.

2465
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,100
That's messed up.

2466
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:12,480
That's so messed...

2467
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:14,860
What?

2468
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:16,520
It won't even let me pee here?

2469
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:18,260
In the bathroom?

2470
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:20,700
This is messed up.

2471
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:21,020
Wait.

2472
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:26,140
Oh my gosh.

2473
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:27,620
How am I...

2474
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:28,760
What am I...

2475
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:30,140
What am I supposed to do?

2476
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:31,840
I think I'm supposed to grab him.

2477
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:36,300
Okay, let's wait for them to pass again.

2478
01:57:42,010 --> 01:57:43,230
Let's wait for them to pass again.

2479
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:50,140
Oops.

2480
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:54,340
Alright, here we go.

2481
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:56,240
La, la, la, la, la.

2482
01:57:57,460 --> 01:57:58,460
Yeah, we're gonna put him...

2483
01:57:58,460 --> 01:57:58,540
Oh.

2484
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:00,780
I think this guy's gonna see me though.

2485
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:02,940
Please, please, go.

2486
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:08,420
Shawwww!

2487
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:12,760
Alright!

2488
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:18,490
Yippee!

2489
01:58:20,410 --> 01:58:22,370
And we'll wait for them to run by again.

2490
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:23,690
Whenever they come by.

2491
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:24,170
There they are.

2492
01:58:24,650 --> 01:58:25,750
I knew they'd be soon.

2493
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:27,810
Okay.

2494
01:58:28,990 --> 01:58:30,870
And then this guy's walking past.

2495
01:58:31,130 --> 01:58:32,430
But we're gonna wait for him to turn.

2496
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:33,810
Or go down.

2497
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:35,090
I think he goes down.

2498
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:36,510
Nevermind.

2499
01:58:36,690 --> 01:58:37,330
That's okay though.

2500
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:39,150
Oh.

2501
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:44,710
Yeah, yeah.

2502
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:45,910
Calm yourself.

2503
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:48,170
Calm yourself.

2504
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:49,650
Just two dudes sleeping in a bathroom?

2505
01:58:50,170 --> 01:58:50,450
No.

2506
01:58:50,890 --> 01:58:53,390
Three dudes sleeping in a bathroom.

2507
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:54,350
Hahahaha.

2508
01:58:57,810 --> 01:58:58,990
Add more dudes.

2509
01:59:02,210 --> 01:59:02,650
Perfect.

2510
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:07,470
Can I go into this truck?

2511
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:12,400
Okay.

2512
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:19,670
Oh, that's right.

2513
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:21,750
That's the guy that's hammered up there.

2514
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:22,190
Okay.

2515
01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:23,630
There they are.

2516
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:25,270
We'll wait for them to leave.

2517
01:59:29,070 --> 01:59:29,670
Uh-uh.

2518
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:32,230
Leave.

2519
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:33,630
Leave.

2520
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:35,670
Leave.

2521
01:59:41,210 --> 01:59:42,390
Is there anything in here?

2522
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:44,110
Okay.

2523
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:44,310
No.

2524
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:44,690
Alright.

2525
01:59:44,810 --> 01:59:46,170
Now we can get this cutscene.

2526
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:47,950
Huh?

2527
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:48,350
Oh, okay.

2528
01:59:48,350 --> 01:59:50,650
As I walked in, I ran into a soldier.

2529
01:59:50,830 --> 01:59:51,230
A soldier.

2530
01:59:51,390 --> 01:59:54,570
The guy was so hammered that he confused me with one of his buddies.

2531
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:54,970
Hey, Mike.

2532
01:59:56,310 --> 01:59:56,790
Oh.

2533
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:57,290
A Mike.

2534
01:59:57,490 --> 01:59:57,710
Hey.

2535
01:59:58,390 --> 01:59:58,870
Mike.

2536
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:01,650
You want a drink?

2537
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:02,390
No, Mike.

2538
02:00:02,630 --> 02:00:03,890
Uh, no thank you.

2539
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:05,730
I don't drink when I escape.

2540
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:05,830
I don't drink when I escape.

2541
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:07,190
Hold on.

2542
02:00:08,690 --> 02:00:10,490
You're not Mike.

2543
02:00:11,010 --> 02:00:11,570
No.

2544
02:00:11,710 --> 02:00:12,510
I'm Fox.

2545
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:12,870
Oh, my God.

2546
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:14,050
Shut up, Jesse Fox.

2547
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:14,610
Jesse Fox.

2548
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:15,230
Yes, you're Mike.

2549
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:17,290
You're the prisoner?

2550
02:00:17,750 --> 02:00:21,890
I would escape too if I could.

2551
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:22,610
Oh, my God.

2552
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:22,930
Jesse.

2553
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:23,530
Jesse.

2554
02:00:23,610 --> 02:00:23,810
Why?

2555
02:00:23,810 --> 02:00:25,970
To see my daughter.

2556
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:31,490
It turns out that he had a little daughter who he hadn't seen in three years.

2557
02:00:31,710 --> 02:00:32,070
Aww.

2558
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:35,150
Every year he requests leave to go see her.

2559
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:35,450
Aww.

2560
02:00:35,450 --> 02:00:35,810
Aww.

2561
02:00:35,810 --> 02:00:38,350
And every year his drill sergeant rejects him.

2562
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:38,890
Drill sergeant.

2563
02:00:38,890 --> 02:00:39,610
I'm gonna kill that guy.

2564
02:00:40,230 --> 02:00:43,390
So, in a week, the daughter was turning six.

2565
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:43,890
No.

2566
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:45,750
And Mike requested leave again.

2567
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:49,570
And yet, again, the drill sergeant rejected him.

2568
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:51,570
That daughter's not even gonna know who that guy is.

2569
02:00:51,570 --> 02:00:52,690
Which was why he was drowning his sorrows.

2570
02:00:52,730 --> 02:00:53,090
Aww.

2571
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:54,550
It's so sad.

2572
02:00:56,330 --> 02:00:58,250
Until he knocked himself out.

2573
02:00:59,330 --> 02:00:59,810
Yay.

2574
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:01,690
Oh, wait.

2575
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:02,470
Whoa.

2576
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:02,750
Sorry.

2577
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:04,070
Oh, my gosh.

2578
02:01:04,350 --> 02:01:05,570
How do I escape from this?

2579
02:01:05,610 --> 02:01:05,790
Okay.

2580
02:01:05,810 --> 02:01:05,990
And now, I'm gonna go to the other room.

2581
02:01:06,110 --> 02:01:07,930
Help Mike get permission slip stamped.

2582
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:14,310
Permission request.

2583
02:01:18,330 --> 02:01:20,930
It's a stealth game and he's a stealth dad.

2584
02:01:21,290 --> 02:01:21,630
I'm shy.

2585
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:22,330
Oh.

2586
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:26,710
Needs to be sealed by the instruction sergeant.

2587
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:27,610
Okay.

2588
02:01:30,710 --> 02:01:32,290
Sweet dreams, Mike.

2589
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:37,380
We're gonna help Mike out.

2590
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:38,300
We're gonna help Mike out.

2591
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:43,860
Oh, my gosh.

2592
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:44,860
Oh, there's another bathroom.

2593
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:47,340
There's a lot of bathrooms in this area.

2594
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:50,680
I guess that's very kind of them, because...

2595
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:53,420
I ran into a guard as I went in.

2596
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:53,660
No!

2597
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:55,040
Oh.

2598
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:56,020
He was urinating.

2599
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:56,560
Ew.

2600
02:01:57,540 --> 02:02:00,720
Please don't tell me you pissed that guard off while he was urinating.

2601
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:01,340
Oh.

2602
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:01,900
They couldn't.

2603
02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:03,260
Someone beat me to it.

2604
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:03,560
What?

2605
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:06,720
What the hell are you doing, scumbag?

2606
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:08,280
He's peeing!

2607
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:10,280
Did you wash your hands?

2608
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:12,900
It's the most important mission you've had all game, man.

2609
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:13,540
Yeah.

2610
02:02:13,780 --> 02:02:16,580
Are you touching your dick with your dirty hands?

2611
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:18,820
How can you be such a pig?

2612
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:22,600
Hands are lost before, not after peeing.

2613
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:23,240
What?

2614
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:23,880
Yes, sir.

2615
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:27,300
Why did you stop peeing, scumbag?

2616
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:29,620
Sir, I ran out of pee, sir.

2617
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:31,600
What a pussy!

2618
02:02:32,140 --> 02:02:34,780
Who do you think you are, a fucking civil?

2619
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:38,520
A soldier continues peeing even if his balls are empty.

2620
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:40,260
Now get the hell out of here!

2621
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:41,740
Sir, yes, sir.

2622
02:02:41,820 --> 02:02:42,860
This guy is so loud.

2623
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:45,300
Sergeant, there's someone behind you.

2624
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:48,380
Fuck, soldier, did I tell you to look behind me?

2625
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:49,640
This guy sucks.

2626
02:02:50,620 --> 02:02:52,840
Then why the hell are you looking behind me?

2627
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:57,660
Here, you don't look, listen, or speak unless I tell you to do it.

2628
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:58,240
Pee is stored in the balls.

2629
02:02:58,480 --> 02:02:58,760
Understood?

2630
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:00,180
Sir, yes, sir.

2631
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,120
Pee is stored in the...

2632
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:04,160
That damn drill sergeant acted tough with his men.

2633
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:06,980
But he ended up crying like a baby with me.

2634
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,180
Cry like a little baby...

2635
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:08,600
Oh!

2636
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,220
I'm actually fighting him.

2637
02:03:11,380 --> 02:03:12,740
Who the fuck are you?

2638
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:15,040
And where the hell is your uniform?

2639
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:17,960
Um...

2640
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:19,700
Stolen.

2641
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,660
It's been stolen, sir.

2642
02:03:22,900 --> 02:03:24,960
Someone broke into my locker and took it.

2643
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:26,480
And who the hell was it?

2644
02:03:26,780 --> 02:03:27,640
It was...

2645
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:28,620
Mike.

2646
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,860
It was... Mike, sir.

2647
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:33,940
Damn, you son of a bitch!

2648
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:35,000
Which one?

2649
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:37,400
You might need to narrow it down, scumbag.

2650
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:38,560
It was...

2651
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:39,880
It's all ripped and from Texas.

2652
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,640
Just like me, sir.

2653
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:42,420
The way...

2654
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:42,660
Fuck!

2655
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:43,780
You're from Texas?

2656
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:46,680
Only two things come from Texas.

2657
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:47,940
Tex and ash.

2658
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:48,460
Turn home, you assholes!

2659
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:50,400
Which one are you, boy?

2660
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:52,340
I don't see any ash smears.

2661
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:55,000
But I definitely see a shit stain.

2662
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:58,200
But, sir, Texas exports propane accessories.

2663
02:03:58,200 --> 02:03:59,220
Shut the fuck up, shit smear!

2664
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:01,120
Propane and propane accessories.

2665
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:02,440
I'm not a shit smear.

2666
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:03,600
Yes, you are.

2667
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:06,700
No, no, I'm not.

2668
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:07,360
No, no, I'm not.

2669
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:07,380
No, no, I'm not.

2670
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:08,280
Hold on, Mr. Fox.

2671
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:11,340
Didn't you say it was the drill sergeant who ended up crying like a baby?

2672
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:12,780
You're contradicting yourself.

2673
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:13,720
It was you.

2674
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:14,260
It was me.

2675
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:15,940
Sergeant, execute this liar.

2676
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:17,100
Yes, sir.

2677
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:18,760
What?

2678
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:20,880
I died.

2679
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:23,340
I died because I'm a liar.

2680
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:36,480
I guess we go fight the drill sergeant.

2681
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:37,900
I guess.

2682
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,380
Do we have to do this fight?

2683
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:41,140
We have to because we have to get it...

2684
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:42,620
I ran into a guard as I went in.

2685
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:44,620
We have to get our thing approved.

2686
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:45,900
Or Mike's thing approved.

2687
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:46,140
I guess.

2688
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:47,580
Who the fuck are you?

2689
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:49,500
And where the hell is your...

2690
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:49,840
Um, okay.

2691
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:52,440
My uniform was...

2692
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,260
We have to make it so that the drill sergeant cries.

2693
02:04:57,980 --> 02:04:59,500
We have to make it so he cries.

2694
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:00,140
He cries.

2695
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:04,040
Um...

2696
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:09,260
If I say I lost it, I feel he's gonna get mad at me.

2697
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:10,860
I think laundry?

2698
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:12,240
Let's try laundry.

2699
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:13,820
In the laundry, sir.

2700
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:16,120
And what in the hell is laundry?

2701
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:17,840
What is your uniform doing in the laundry?

2702
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:19,580
It was dirty, sir.

2703
02:05:20,020 --> 02:05:21,460
Are you kidding me?

2704
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:24,300
Since when the clothes have to be clean?

2705
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:25,620
The hands have to be clean?

2706
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:26,940
Because he put it in the laundry once he got a job, sir.

2707
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:28,220
Why do we keep talking about Texas?

2708
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:29,320
Fuck!

2709
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:30,700
You're from Texas?

2710
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,380
Only two things come from Texas.

2711
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:33,600
Oh, no.

2712
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:34,240
I think we messed up.

2713
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:35,440
Charcoal and assholes.

2714
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:38,220
We can't bring up Texas, you guys, because we start crying.

2715
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:41,780
I don't see ash smears, but I definitely see a shit stain.

2716
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:42,800
We can't talk about Texas.

2717
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:44,960
Sir, Texas exports propane accessories.

2718
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:45,400
Okay.

2719
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:46,100
Shut the fuck up.

2720
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:49,900
We can't talk about Texas.

2721
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:50,540
We'll cry.

2722
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:52,260
We'll cry, you guys.

2723
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:56,120
Now, Texas is the automatic fail.

2724
02:05:58,820 --> 02:05:59,300
Wait.

2725
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:01,360
I'm just curious about this.

2726
02:06:01,780 --> 02:06:03,100
It almost looks like an area.

2727
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:03,800
Oh.

2728
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,000
It's not.

2729
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:06,520
Okay.

2730
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:07,880
Are they not still running around?

2731
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:10,060
Did we win?

2732
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:15,480
I ran into a guard.

2733
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:20,140
I think our best bet was honestly it getting... stolen.

2734
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:24,000
Right?

2735
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:25,760
But we haven't done Lost yet either.

2736
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:26,640
Let's just try it.

2737
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:29,080
I think he's gonna make fun of us.

2738
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:40,200
In Texas!

2739
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:41,100
Don't say Texas.

2740
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:41,740
Oh.

2741
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:42,320
Oh!

2742
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:42,940
Okay.

2743
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:44,660
Um... stolen.

2744
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:45,640
Stolen.

2745
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:46,040
Stolen.

2746
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:54,400
Uh, it was... clue?

2747
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:57,200
What's loyalty?

2748
02:06:59,200 --> 02:06:59,840
Clue.

2749
02:06:59,940 --> 02:07:00,600
What's clue?

2750
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:03,560
We have a clue.

2751
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:08,380
In Texas!

2752
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:10,820
In Te- arm?

2753
02:07:12,140 --> 02:07:13,620
He was born in Texas.

2754
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:18,540
You'll never escape the Tex- what's the arm?

2755
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:19,860
Without one arm.

2756
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:21,860
Are you kidding me, scumbag?

2757
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:24,820
There's no such thing as a one-armed soldier here!

2758
02:07:25,060 --> 02:07:25,600
There is!

2759
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:28,100
All you maggots barely shoot properly with two arms!

2760
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:29,440
What do you mean?

2761
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:33,240
Back in Texas, we can shoot without using any arms.

2762
02:07:33,580 --> 02:07:34,140
Fuck!

2763
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:35,380
You're from Texas?

2764
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:38,140
Only two names come to Texas.

2765
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:40,740
Jesse, why do you keep bringing up Texas?

2766
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:43,480
I don't see any ass in here.

2767
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:45,080
Why do you keep bringing up Texas?

2768
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:46,560
Definitely see a shit stain!

2769
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:48,780
Sir, Texas exports.

2770
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:57,820
This guy just brings up Texas un... un...

2771
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:00,420
Unprompted.

2772
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:02,620
Nobody cares where you're from, Jesse.

2773
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:04,520
You're not special.

2774
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:04,860
Oh.

2775
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:06,700
That looks dangerous.

2776
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:08,280
That looks like a bad area.

2777
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:12,180
That looks like a not-so-good area.

2778
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:19,940
I ran into a guard as I wa- Okay.

2779
02:08:19,940 --> 02:08:20,880
Alright, we got this.

2780
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:21,860
Who the fuck are you?

2781
02:08:22,220 --> 02:08:24,040
And where the hell is your uniform?

2782
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:24,580
Okay.

2783
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:26,240
It was... okay.

2784
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:28,980
If we say double lost, right?

2785
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:32,580
Because he asked- our first one was lost, and he's like, wait, you have a second one.

2786
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:34,180
We say it's lost also.

2787
02:08:35,580 --> 02:08:36,980
I can't find it, sir.

2788
02:08:37,140 --> 02:08:38,260
I must have lost it.

2789
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:40,200
Oh, no, no, no.

2790
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:40,520
Lost.

2791
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:42,680
I can't find it, sir.

2792
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:44,140
I must have lost it.

2793
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:46,000
You shit for brains!

2794
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:47,940
And do you have a spare one?

2795
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:49,020
Yes, sir!

2796
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:49,640
Yes, sir!

2797
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:52,640
And where would that crusty-ass spare uniform be?

2798
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:54,280
It's lost.

2799
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:56,320
I can't find it, sir.

2800
02:08:56,460 --> 02:08:57,800
I must have lost it.

2801
02:08:57,920 --> 02:08:59,580
You shit for brains!

2802
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:01,640
And do you have a spare one?

2803
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:02,680
Yes, sir!

2804
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:06,320
And where would that crusty-ass spare uniform be?

2805
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:09,860
I can't find it, sir.

2806
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:11,380
I must have lost it.

2807
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:13,160
You shit for brains!

2808
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,280
And do you have a spare one?

2809
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,240
Yes, sir!

2810
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:19,900
And where would that crusty-ass spare uniform be?

2811
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:23,660
I can't find it, sir.

2812
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:25,080
I must have lost it.

2813
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:26,900
You shit for brains!

2814
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:29,020
And do you have a spare one?

2815
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,020
Yes, sir!

2816
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:33,740
And where would that crusty-ass spare uniform be?

2817
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:34,760
I can't find it, sir.

2818
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:34,760
I must have lost it.

2819
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:35,000
I can't find it, sir.

2820
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:35,740
I must have lost it.

2821
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:36,780
This is... we'll say it's stolen.

2822
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:38,520
This is endless, eh?

2823
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:41,420
Okay.

2824
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:45,680
Let's try the clue.

2825
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:47,880
Why did you create a time loop?

2826
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:50,320
I'm still curious what loyalty is.

2827
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:53,500
But I think it's gonna be like, oh, I can't say who.

2828
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:56,060
And then he's gonna say, us in Texas, we're loyal.

2829
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:59,140
We still don't know his identity, sir.

2830
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:00,300
But we have a clue.

2831
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,220
What clue, you fuck?

2832
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:04,840
We know he was born...

2833
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:05,360
In Texas.

2834
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:06,960
Okay, I'm gonna say the place.

2835
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,160
In the same state you were, sir.

2836
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:11,660
So that son of a bitch is from Texas.

2837
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:12,580
Oh my god!

2838
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:12,940
Hold on.

2839
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:14,820
You're telling me you're from Texas?

2840
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:17,160
Only two things come out of Texas.

2841
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:18,280
We got it!

2842
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:19,260
Propane and assholes.

2843
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:22,080
I don't see any propane accessories.

2844
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:25,200
We did it!

2845
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:26,040
Made from a ship.

2846
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:27,720
Fuck you little...

2847
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:28,900
Of course you are.

2848
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:30,580
Look at your brown eyes.

2849
02:10:30,980 --> 02:10:31,460
What?

2850
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:32,780
Poopy brown eyes.

2851
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:33,140
My ass is blue!

2852
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:34,160
You sure?

2853
02:10:34,440 --> 02:10:37,080
The whole base is talking about your brown eyes.

2854
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:37,800
No!

2855
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:39,260
No!

2856
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,640
I'm not!

2857
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:45,660
To avoid confusion in the record, did he have blue or brown eyes, Mr. Fox?

2858
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:46,500
Both.

2859
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:48,700
But now he had black eyes.

2860
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:50,220
One second, bud.

2861
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:51,920
I'll leave this out of the report.

2862
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:52,960
Proceed.

2863
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:56,960
Just as he started to tear up, I helped all blue eyes kiss the canvas.

2864
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:58,260
We turned it against him.

2865
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:00,900
Boss defeated.

2866
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:02,040
Boss defeated.

2867
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:05,260
Yippee!

2868
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:07,240
Oh, I mean...

2869
02:11:08,020 --> 02:11:09,580
Freeze, or I'll shoot.

2870
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:11,980
What the hell are you doing, scumbag?

2871
02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:12,420
Oh!

2872
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:13,800
Aiming at you with my weapon.

2873
02:11:14,140 --> 02:11:16,980
Fuck, soldier, did I tell you to aim your weapon at me?

2874
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:18,300
Jesse's full of power.

2875
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:18,840
No, sir.

2876
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:22,140
Then why the hell are you aiming your fucking weapon at me?

2877
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,440
Here you don't look, listen, or speak.

2878
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:26,640
Unless I tell you to do it.

2879
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:27,280
Understood?

2880
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:28,180
Oh, my God.

2881
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:28,920
Yes, sir.

2882
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:32,840
Did you wash your hands before aiming your weapon at me, scumbag?

2883
02:11:34,180 --> 02:11:34,960
No, sir.

2884
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:37,460
Fuck, how can you be such a pig?

2885
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:38,980
Get the hell out of here.

2886
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:40,240
Sir, yes, sir.

2887
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:41,800
Yeah, get out of here, stupid.

2888
02:11:46,090 --> 02:11:47,310
Um, can I get this?

2889
02:11:48,490 --> 02:11:51,210
I couldn't stamp the form until I found an ink pad.

2890
02:11:51,590 --> 02:11:52,790
Or a tampon.

2891
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:53,430
A what?

2892
02:11:54,170 --> 02:11:54,610
Jesse?

2893
02:11:54,610 --> 02:11:55,610
Jesse what?

2894
02:11:58,870 --> 02:11:59,270
Okay.

2895
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:01,170
So we have to find an ink pad.

2896
02:12:03,730 --> 02:12:04,130
Except...

2897
02:12:04,130 --> 02:12:06,530
I hope not the ladder.

2898
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:07,190
I hope not.

2899
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:09,930
What a Texas-style uno reverse.

2900
02:12:10,290 --> 02:12:11,070
Oh, what's that?

2901
02:12:11,270 --> 02:12:11,790
I know, right?

2902
02:12:16,330 --> 02:12:17,210
That was kind of...

2903
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:17,590
Oh, shit.

2904
02:12:17,890 --> 02:12:19,970
Um, you guys...

2905
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:21,310
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

2906
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:26,540
That was close.

2907
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:27,800
Oh, shit.

2908
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:36,160
Oh, shit.

2909
02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:38,300
And we're gonna take him out.

2910
02:12:42,490 --> 02:12:42,950
Yeah.

2911
02:12:45,910 --> 02:12:46,950
We found the stamp.

2912
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:50,730
I entered one of the barracks, I saw that it was different from the others.

2913
02:12:50,890 --> 02:12:53,450
First off, it had its own urinal.

2914
02:12:53,570 --> 02:12:54,130
That's strange.

2915
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:56,290
Moreover, it had an office desk.

2916
02:12:56,350 --> 02:12:57,490
That's not as strange.

2917
02:12:57,550 --> 02:12:59,130
I figured it was the drill sergeant's quarters.

2918
02:12:59,830 --> 02:13:04,710
I had plenty of time because I was sure he was still indisposed in the bathroom.

2919
02:13:04,710 --> 02:13:05,510
Nice.

2920
02:13:07,830 --> 02:13:10,750
Which means... I'm level 6!

2921
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:13,510
Die hard.

2922
02:13:13,650 --> 02:13:14,570
Increase your max HP.

2923
02:13:14,910 --> 02:13:17,230
Oh wait, your max HP is increased by 50%.

2924
02:13:17,230 --> 02:13:19,590
The gun deals 30% more damage.

2925
02:13:22,290 --> 02:13:23,850
Die hard or lethal weapon.

2926
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:28,870
I feel like die hard would be better, right?

2927
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:31,370
To get my max HP... up?

2928
02:13:32,770 --> 02:13:34,450
I think this one is better.

2929
02:13:37,250 --> 02:13:38,810
Oh my god, I used his toilet.

2930
02:13:40,710 --> 02:13:41,810
Got more bullets.

2931
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:43,970
Perfect.

2932
02:13:50,510 --> 02:13:51,070
Beep!

2933
02:13:51,470 --> 02:13:52,030
Yay!

2934
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:57,270
Okay, let's go return this to our buddy.

2935
02:13:58,170 --> 02:14:00,030
Once these guys run away.

2936
02:14:03,970 --> 02:14:06,590
Did you wash your hands before saving?

2937
02:14:09,850 --> 02:14:11,870
Can I jump into any of these trucks now?

2938
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:13,510
Okay.

2939
02:14:13,510 --> 02:14:15,970
I also noticed that there's a way to go up.

2940
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:24,020
That's exactly what I was worried about!

2941
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:28,880
Fragment!

2942
02:14:29,020 --> 02:14:31,120
Did you wash your hands before you save?

2943
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:33,720
Sir, yes sir!

2944
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:38,840
Let's go deliver this to Mike.

2945
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:40,880
Mike?

2946
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:41,180
Mark?

2947
02:14:41,380 --> 02:14:42,240
Wait, what's their names?

2948
02:14:50,770 --> 02:14:51,330
Mike.

2949
02:14:52,570 --> 02:14:53,130
Casey!

2950
02:14:53,150 --> 02:14:53,690
Thanks for the gift!

2951
02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:00,530
Yippee!

2952
02:15:00,530 --> 02:15:02,390
Oh, I get a special thing for...

2953
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:03,830
I get an extra body!

2954
02:15:04,130 --> 02:15:05,430
For helping him!

2955
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:07,250
Mwah!

2956
02:15:07,250 --> 02:15:08,230
Thank you, mister.

2957
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:09,490
Okay.

2958
02:15:10,250 --> 02:15:11,170
Okay, they're coming.

2959
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:13,590
They're coming, they're coming, they're going, they're going, they're going.

2960
02:15:13,730 --> 02:15:13,950
Okay.

2961
02:15:15,090 --> 02:15:15,570
Nice.

2962
02:15:16,370 --> 02:15:16,850
Okay.

2963
02:15:18,910 --> 02:15:20,630
And they're gone.

2964
02:15:22,890 --> 02:15:23,370
And...

2965
02:15:23,370 --> 02:15:25,370
All my potties are...

2966
02:15:26,050 --> 02:15:27,710
They're all... Yeah, okay.

2967
02:15:27,810 --> 02:15:28,750
I'm just gonna save real quick.

2968
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:31,670
Okay, let's go.

2969
02:15:33,310 --> 02:15:35,050
Oh, um, let's...

2970
02:15:36,690 --> 02:15:37,470
There we go.

2971
02:15:37,990 --> 02:15:39,630
I can go up.

2972
02:15:40,210 --> 02:15:41,770
As you can see here.

2973
02:15:42,170 --> 02:15:43,590
I can go upwards.

2974
02:15:46,130 --> 02:15:47,810
And there he was.

2975
02:15:48,110 --> 02:15:50,410
The bastard with a machine gun.

2976
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:52,710
Blocking my way to the north gate.

2977
02:15:53,190 --> 02:15:56,530
But, I didn't fight him until I got some grenades.

2978
02:15:57,190 --> 02:15:57,890
Oh, okay.

2979
02:15:57,970 --> 02:15:58,770
So we leave.

2980
02:15:58,950 --> 02:16:00,430
Oh, uh, and we hide.

2981
02:16:04,550 --> 02:16:07,250
Did you wash your hands before you touched that potty?

2982
02:16:07,410 --> 02:16:07,850
Sir!

2983
02:16:08,010 --> 02:16:08,370
Yes, sir!

2984
02:16:09,410 --> 02:16:10,870
I'm always washing my hands!

2985
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:11,410
Sir!

2986
02:16:12,130 --> 02:16:13,210
Jose, welcome to membership.

2987
02:16:13,310 --> 02:16:13,850
Thank you!

2988
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:19,550
Okay, we need grenades now.

2989
02:16:20,630 --> 02:16:22,570
We need grenades now, huh?

2990
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:30,260
I think now's the best time to take him.

2991
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:32,020
Oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop.

2992
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:33,200
You noticed something?

2993
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,540
But he's a little silly.

2994
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:40,460
Nice.

2995
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:44,900
And they're running by.

2996
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:45,760
And they're running by.

2997
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:46,540
And they're running by!

2998
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:49,780
And they're running gone.

2999
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:51,080
Okay.

3000
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:53,680
Oh, shoot.

3001
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:55,000
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3002
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:56,080
Wait, wait, um...

3003
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:00,500
Um...

3004
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,080
Oh, that was a close one.

3005
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:09,600
Uh, X.

3006
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:10,420
There we go.

3007
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:11,640
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

3008
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:12,480
Run, run, run.

3009
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:13,260
I don't have a lot of time.

3010
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:14,500
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

3011
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:16,480
No!

3012
02:17:17,140 --> 02:17:17,960
You're from Texas!

3013
02:17:18,700 --> 02:17:19,540
I think those grenades!

3014
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:22,520
Nice!

3015
02:17:25,220 --> 02:17:26,980
Guys, that was a close one.

3016
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:27,680
I'm not gonna lie.

3017
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:29,260
That really stressed me out.

3018
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:32,780
Grenades!

3019
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:38,500
Oh, I can't have any more than eight grenades.

3020
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:40,660
Okay.

3021
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:46,240
Since I gamed that one so hard, I'm gonna actually save.

3022
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:50,700
And then I'm gonna empty it in the...

3023
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:51,280
the...

3024
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:52,040
the...

3025
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:52,280
the...

3026
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:52,820
the...

3027
02:17:52,820 --> 02:17:52,960
the...

3028
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:53,040
the...

3029
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:53,160
the...

3030
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:53,480
the...

3031
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:53,760
the...

3032
02:17:56,580 --> 02:18:00,240
And let's go back to our chloroform, cause I really like this one.

3033
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:04,360
I'm waiting for the...

3034
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:06,240
Yeah, there we go.

3035
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:08,200
Wait.

3036
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:09,340
Is that them?

3037
02:18:12,420 --> 02:18:12,820
Oh.

3038
02:18:13,340 --> 02:18:13,740
Wait.

3039
02:18:14,600 --> 02:18:16,060
Oh, they like, go through...

3040
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:18,520
Huh?

3041
02:18:19,240 --> 02:18:20,240
Did they go down here?

3042
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:22,140
Wait, huh?

3043
02:18:22,140 --> 02:18:23,000
Did they go through here?

3044
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:24,740
Why can't I go through here?

3045
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:25,940
Okay.

3046
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:27,020
That's unfair.

3047
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:28,040
For sure.

3048
02:18:38,110 --> 02:18:39,690
Can I follow them through?

3049
02:18:39,990 --> 02:18:41,950
But I guess we don't need to go down there, huh?

3050
02:18:42,530 --> 02:18:43,870
But there was like an extra room.

3051
02:18:44,830 --> 02:18:45,530
I think...

3052
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:47,170
I think I can follow them through.

3053
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:48,110
Like...

3054
02:18:48,110 --> 02:18:49,550
Or rather, like...

3055
02:18:51,690 --> 02:18:52,910
Maybe I should wait and see.

3056
02:18:53,890 --> 02:18:55,050
I'm curious, you guys.

3057
02:18:56,870 --> 02:18:58,530
Because it looks like a secret area, right?

3058
02:19:02,570 --> 02:19:04,270
That doesn't look like the starting area.

3059
02:19:04,370 --> 02:19:05,350
I don't remember that line.

3060
02:19:06,150 --> 02:19:06,850
Oh, here they come.

3061
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:16,440
Nope.

3062
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:19,880
There was an attempt.

3063
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:22,840
Okay.

3064
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:28,440
Could have gone right from the starting...

3065
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:28,620
Oh!

3066
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:28,860
Oh!

3067
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:32,280
Oh!

3068
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:33,720
I see what you mean.

3069
02:19:44,950 --> 02:19:45,790
No, no, no, no.

3070
02:19:54,890 --> 02:19:55,370
Um...

3071
02:19:55,370 --> 02:19:56,810
Yeah, that was a sign.

3072
02:19:56,990 --> 02:19:58,010
You're Fox, right?

3073
02:19:58,250 --> 02:19:58,590
Oh.

3074
02:19:58,690 --> 02:20:01,630
I knew you were going to pass through here sooner or later.

3075
02:20:01,630 --> 02:20:03,450
I'm Machine Gun Mike.

3076
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:05,350
Machine Gun Mike.

3077
02:20:05,470 --> 02:20:05,690
Are you ready to face me?

3078
02:20:05,790 --> 02:20:08,730
Or are you going to run away like a coward?

3079
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:09,710
Run away?

3080
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:12,170
I don't run from dead men.

3081
02:20:12,310 --> 02:20:14,130
Then prepare to die.

3082
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:17,010
Machine Gun Mike.

3083
02:20:20,370 --> 02:20:21,010
Oh.

3084
02:20:21,110 --> 02:20:21,430
Okay.

3085
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:21,890
Interesting.

3086
02:20:26,570 --> 02:20:28,430
Hide as much as you want.

3087
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:30,930
Those sandbags are the last victim.

3088
02:20:31,370 --> 02:20:32,010
Oh.

3089
02:20:33,010 --> 02:20:33,650
Okay.

3090
02:20:33,670 --> 02:20:34,230
Oh my gosh.

3091
02:20:34,390 --> 02:20:35,250
Not good.

3092
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:35,950
This is not good.

3093
02:20:48,810 --> 02:20:49,330
Oh.

3094
02:20:49,570 --> 02:20:50,030
Ouch.

3095
02:20:52,700 --> 02:20:53,680
Holy moly.

3096
02:20:55,220 --> 02:20:56,260
And remember...

3097
02:20:56,260 --> 02:20:57,240
We...

3098
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:59,080
We increased our HP.

3099
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:00,700
Holy cow.

3100
02:21:02,820 --> 02:21:04,160
We increased our HP.

3101
02:21:04,840 --> 02:21:06,460
Yeah, we got to go fast on this one.

3102
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:06,960
Okay.

3103
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:09,100
You're Fox, right?

3104
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:20,700
As much as you want.

3105
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:23,220
Those sandbags will drive you...

3106
02:21:23,220 --> 02:21:24,080
Oh my gosh.

3107
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:25,860
I need to...

3108
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:26,900
I need to heal before I...

3109
02:21:27,820 --> 02:21:29,820
I think I need to heal before I start this.

3110
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:34,520
Let's just do that right quick.

3111
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:38,240
Once we're fully healed, I'll...

3112
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:40,380
I'll save again.

3113
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:41,020
Okay.

3114
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:42,380
Okay.

3115
02:21:42,380 --> 02:21:42,400
Okay.

3116
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:47,300
Once we're fully healed, I'll save again.

3117
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:48,360
So we're healed...

3118
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:49,040
We're...

3119
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:50,120
We start at full health.

3120
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:51,860
And then...

3121
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:54,120
We shall go in.

3122
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:55,900
Did you punch the desk?

3123
02:21:58,280 --> 02:21:59,160
There was an attempt.

3124
02:21:59,580 --> 02:22:00,880
I can punch his bed, though.

3125
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:02,600
Okay.

3126
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:09,360
Now I also have to hope that these guys...

3127
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:10,800
Are not coming.

3128
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:12,660
Let me think about it.

3129
02:22:12,740 --> 02:22:12,940
Okay.

3130
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:16,280
Okay.

3131
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:16,720
I think we're okay.

3132
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:25,090
You're Fox, right?

3133
02:22:25,330 --> 02:22:26,130
I knew...

3134
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:39,310
I know I probably won't have time for this, but...

3135
02:22:39,830 --> 02:22:40,590
Oh my gosh.

3136
02:22:40,650 --> 02:22:40,850
Ouch.

3137
02:22:40,910 --> 02:22:41,170
Ouch.

3138
02:22:41,170 --> 02:22:41,350
Ouch.

3139
02:22:41,350 --> 02:22:41,490
Ouch.

3140
02:22:41,490 --> 02:22:41,650
Ouch.

3141
02:22:41,650 --> 02:22:41,770
Ouch.

3142
02:22:41,770 --> 02:22:41,790
Ouch.

3143
02:22:41,790 --> 02:22:41,810
Ouch.

3144
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:42,010
Ouch.

3145
02:22:42,250 --> 02:22:42,270
Ouch.

3146
02:22:43,170 --> 02:22:43,650
Ouch.

3147
02:22:48,110 --> 02:22:48,690
Oh my gosh.

3148
02:22:48,730 --> 02:22:48,830
No.

3149
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:49,110
No.

3150
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:49,510
No, no!

3151
02:22:49,970 --> 02:22:50,330
No!

3152
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:50,830
No, no!

3153
02:22:52,510 --> 02:22:53,370
This is hard!

3154
02:22:53,550 --> 02:22:54,050
This is hard!

3155
02:22:54,150 --> 02:22:56,070
Because as soon as he loads, I'm trying to heal!

3156
02:22:58,530 --> 02:23:00,290
I think I already messed up, you guys.

3157
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:02,090
I think I already messed up.

3158
02:23:05,870 --> 02:23:07,370
I've already messed up, you guys!

3159
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:29,100
Roll under it.

3160
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:31,400
Will it work?

3161
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:31,880
I wonder.

3162
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:32,820
I can try.

3163
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:33,060
I'm gonna cry.

3164
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:36,600
If I get stuck on one side, yeah, I'll roll under it.

3165
02:23:36,620 --> 02:23:37,800
You're Fox, right?

3166
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:40,040
I'm Jesse Fox!

3167
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:41,860
I'm Jesse Fox!

3168
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:50,300
Hide as much as you want.

3169
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:52,420
Those sandbags won't last.

3170
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:53,820
Oh my gosh!

3171
02:24:44,860 --> 02:24:47,480
Oh, see, see, see.

3172
02:24:49,940 --> 02:24:50,940
Damn

3173
02:25:12,470 --> 02:25:13,330
you, Fox!

3174
02:25:14,710 --> 02:25:16,410
Boss defeated!

3175
02:25:16,530 --> 02:25:18,710
Oh, son of a bitch!

3176
02:25:19,390 --> 02:25:20,890
I'm gonna die!

3177
02:25:20,910 --> 02:25:21,610
Somehow we made it.

3178
02:25:22,070 --> 02:25:23,670
It was hard because...

3179
02:25:24,970 --> 02:25:28,470
Because you have to get so close, I think, to attack him.

3180
02:25:28,690 --> 02:25:33,690
So I was having to run, and by the time I was throwing the bombs at him, he was done reloading.

3181
02:25:35,510 --> 02:25:37,690
But we're still healing, so actually this is perfect.

3182
02:25:40,750 --> 02:25:41,910
Oh, I can't see above me.

3183
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:51,840
Kinda late, but I can't stop laughing in the office.

3184
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:56,970
Let's just wait until we're done healing.

3185
02:25:57,950 --> 02:25:58,690
Which

3186
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:08,230
will happen first?

3187
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:09,750
Will I be fully healed?

3188
02:26:09,930 --> 02:26:11,010
Or will...

3189
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:14,320
First!

3190
02:26:17,480 --> 02:26:18,960
The sandbag...

3191
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:20,320
Didn't even have anything.

3192
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:26,180
I arrived at the northern parking lot.

3193
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:29,440
There were trucks and containers all over the place.

3194
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:32,560
I wanted to hide in the right truck.

3195
02:26:32,980 --> 02:26:36,220
Serial number 233 980.

3196
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:40,220
But, Machine Gun Mike could be waiting for me.

3197
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:41,320
Seeking revenge.

3198
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:42,440
What?

3199
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:44,500
What do you mean by that?

3200
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:49,660
Oh, it doesn't work now?

3201
02:26:50,400 --> 02:26:51,860
What the fuck?

3202
02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:53,680
No, this is...

3203
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:54,380
No!

3204
02:26:55,660 --> 02:26:56,840
Come on, thugs!

3205
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:57,580
No!

3206
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:02,400
This is literally just Metal Gear!

3207
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:04,980
Now I go by the name Splash Mike!

3208
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:06,140
Splash Mike!

3209
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:10,200
Because I'm going to splash your entrails all over the place!

3210
02:27:10,220 --> 02:27:10,560
You!

3211
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:14,220
Splash Mike!

3212
02:27:16,680 --> 02:27:17,420
Oh my gosh.

3213
02:27:19,140 --> 02:27:19,620
Wait.

3214
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:21,380
What is this?

3215
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:22,720
Rocket launcher!

3216
02:27:27,710 --> 02:27:29,150
Oh, I have to also load?

3217
02:27:29,450 --> 02:27:29,930
Wait.

3218
02:27:31,470 --> 02:27:32,730
I'm actually kind of confused.

3219
02:27:32,910 --> 02:27:34,730
Oh, I have to have a rocket.

3220
02:27:34,730 --> 02:27:34,790
A rocket.

3221
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:37,730
Okay.

3222
02:27:38,230 --> 02:27:39,130
Um, wait.

3223
02:27:39,210 --> 02:27:40,530
He's going to destroy the trucks though!

3224
02:27:41,250 --> 02:27:42,070
Oh my gosh.

3225
02:27:42,930 --> 02:27:43,750
I need him.

3226
02:27:43,790 --> 02:27:43,950
Wait.

3227
02:27:44,030 --> 02:27:46,130
I need him to destroy stuff so that I can get more...

3228
02:27:46,890 --> 02:27:47,850
Um, wait.

3229
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:53,630
I got greedy there.

3230
02:27:55,170 --> 02:27:55,650
Um...

3231
02:27:56,250 --> 02:27:56,970
Well, shoot.

3232
02:27:58,890 --> 02:27:59,370
Um...

3233
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:04,870
I arrived at the northern...

3234
02:28:04,870 --> 02:28:05,370
I arrived at the northern...

3235
02:28:06,030 --> 02:28:08,610
But also I have to make sure I get into the right truck.

3236
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:11,050
They made sure that I, like, know the number.

3237
02:28:11,210 --> 02:28:13,330
I thought I was going to have to, like, check the numbers, you know?

3238
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:14,390
What the f...

3239
02:28:15,810 --> 02:28:16,170
Huh...

3240
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:20,380
Shoot.

3241
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:21,400
Don't get run over.

3242
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:22,660
Oh!

3243
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:24,160
Uh...

3244
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:25,860
Okay.

3245
02:28:26,100 --> 02:28:26,380
Then,

3246
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:34,130
destroy this part.

3247
02:28:35,070 --> 02:28:35,430
Wait.

3248
02:28:35,490 --> 02:28:36,390
What did you just destroy?

3249
02:28:38,570 --> 02:28:39,650
Just throw grenades.

3250
02:28:41,190 --> 02:28:42,270
Does he know where I am?

3251
02:28:43,410 --> 02:28:44,090
There we go.

3252
02:28:44,250 --> 02:28:50,260
And then, uh, you can, like, blow this part up too.

3253
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:51,800
Just blow this part up.

3254
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:53,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3255
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:56,260
And then I also attack you.

3256
02:28:56,820 --> 02:29:01,400
I can't tell if, uh, if one part does more damage or not.

3257
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:02,620
You know?

3258
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:04,700
Hmm...

3259
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:08,020
It was a sturdy tank.

3260
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:08,980
It was a sturdy tank.

3261
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,660
It's barely scratched at the paint job.

3262
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:10,920
Yeah.

3263
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:13,260
But why didn't you attack it from behind?

3264
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:13,700
Oh.

3265
02:29:13,740 --> 02:29:15,000
It's the weak point of many models.

3266
02:29:15,240 --> 02:29:15,420
Okay.

3267
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:18,160
I was testing its entire surface armor.

3268
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:19,900
I was testing it!

3269
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:20,900
I concluded that every side was strong.

3270
02:29:21,100 --> 02:29:21,440
Yeah.

3271
02:29:21,460 --> 02:29:22,200
Except the rear.

3272
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:22,580
Yes.

3273
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:23,800
Okay.

3274
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:24,480
Good to know.

3275
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:27,820
Thank you very much.

3276
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:33,580
Except... Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

3277
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:35,980
Ouchie!

3278
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:36,780
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3279
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:38,300
Uh... Okay.

3280
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:38,980
We have a...

3281
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,100
...

3282
02:29:41,960 --> 02:29:43,320
Except the rear!

3283
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:43,680
Oh!

3284
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:44,860
That's the front, isn't it?

3285
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:45,920
Oh my gosh!

3286
02:29:46,020 --> 02:29:46,900
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3287
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:47,880
Not the splash damage.

3288
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:49,640
Splash real!

3289
02:29:49,780 --> 02:29:50,320
Splash real!

3290
02:29:59,420 --> 02:30:02,280
I can't have him destroy the trucks though, right?

3291
02:30:02,660 --> 02:30:03,320
I can't...

3292
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,760
I imagine that's how that should work.

3293
02:30:06,940 --> 02:30:07,840
Don't destroy...

3294
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:08,820
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3295
02:30:11,980 --> 02:30:12,420
Oh!

3296
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:15,560
Um, where are you now?

3297
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:20,120
Snakes don't belong in Alaska.

3298
02:30:21,960 --> 02:30:22,400
Cool.

3299
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:24,160
I got two.

3300
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:25,820
Uh, where's the rear?

3301
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:27,000
This is the rear?

3302
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:30,520
Ouchie!

3303
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:31,340
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3304
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:33,680
I'm bleeding out, I'm bleeding out, I'm bleeding out.

3305
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:37,980
This should be a safe spot, maybe.

3306
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:43,300
Hold on!

3307
02:30:46,240 --> 02:30:47,220
Oh my gosh.

3308
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:48,180
Ouchie!

3309
02:30:56,320 --> 02:30:58,380
What are you talking about?

3310
02:30:58,480 --> 02:30:59,780
We're not even close to there!

3311
02:31:02,700 --> 02:31:03,360
A

3312
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:10,740
lot of places, stuff to go to.

3313
02:31:10,740 --> 02:31:10,920
Two!

3314
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:18,440
Aw, man.

3315
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:21,840
Aw, man.

3316
02:31:22,140 --> 02:31:23,620
I was so close to it.

3317
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:25,280
I think it was just one more hit on the butt.

3318
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:28,480
Okay.

3319
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,120
Um...

3320
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:36,880
That was also my fault because I didn't notice that it had finished reloading the cannon, so...

3321
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:38,940
I arrived at the northern...

3322
02:31:40,740 --> 02:31:41,940
What the fuck?

3323
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:45,220
Oh, uh, skip, skip, skip.

3324
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:48,960
Okay.

3325
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,800
And, let's attach.

3326
02:32:00,280 --> 02:32:01,620
Select, and...

3327
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:04,560
And it's loading its cannon!

3328
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:07,200
Maybe this is a safe spot.

3329
02:32:07,460 --> 02:32:08,660
Okay, maybe not.

3330
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:09,500
Or, yes?

3331
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:10,140
I don't know.

3332
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:10,980
Here!

3333
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:13,060
Load its cannon!

3334
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:19,800
And grab this one, too.

3335
02:32:20,300 --> 02:32:21,240
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

3336
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:22,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3337
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:28,000
Trying to get its butt!

3338
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:28,660
Oh, here we go.

3339
02:32:30,060 --> 02:32:30,640
Oh, shoot.

3340
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:45,300
I've learned that you can't hide behind the barrels.

3341
02:32:50,290 --> 02:32:51,450
Barrels are not a safe spot.

3342
02:32:53,770 --> 02:32:54,870
Please let me get your ass.

3343
02:32:57,950 --> 02:32:58,510
Oh, my gosh.

3344
02:32:58,550 --> 02:32:58,710
Oh, my gosh.

3345
02:32:58,710 --> 02:33:00,350
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3346
02:33:01,290 --> 02:33:01,890
Oh, gosh.

3347
02:33:16,640 --> 02:33:17,600
Guys, I think it's over.

3348
02:33:19,340 --> 02:33:20,340
Oh, that was so close.

3349
02:33:21,320 --> 02:33:21,860
Holy cow.

3350
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:23,980
No...

3351
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:34,600
Okay, I know, I know, I know.

3352
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:40,420
Yippee!

3353
02:33:41,660 --> 02:33:42,180
Grrrr!

3354
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:46,040
Grrrr!

3355
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:50,100
After dealing with the tank, I found the truck and hid inside.

3356
02:33:50,300 --> 02:33:51,360
Wait, but the other trophy!

3357
02:33:51,660 --> 02:33:52,600
The other medal!

3358
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:53,840
I should have been selfish.

3359
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,040
I should have been greedy.

3360
02:33:55,740 --> 02:34:00,440
And the military didn't find it weird that everything in the northern parking lot was destroyed?

3361
02:34:01,020 --> 02:34:01,760
Who knows?

3362
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:03,740
Maybe it's a regular occurrence.

3363
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:04,420
Who knows?

3364
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:06,800
But the truck driver must have seen all that destruction.

3365
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:10,040
Well, you know how military grunts are.

3366
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:12,020
You only think when ordered to.

3367
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:15,380
Complete the barracks.

3368
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:16,900
Aw, I didn't get my troll.

3369
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:18,340
I didn't get any secrets either.

3370
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:20,520
Guys, I'm useless.

3371
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:23,040
Chapter Six.

3372
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:25,080
Engineering Problems.

3373
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:26,760
So, in the end...

3374
02:34:26,760 --> 02:34:27,640
Oh, I forgot about this girl.

3375
02:34:27,860 --> 02:34:29,220
...you escaped hidden on that truck?

3376
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:35,320
What about the shit you told me about not escaping in a truck to prevent pollution?

3377
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:40,120
Because the first time it would have been me behind the wheel.

3378
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:44,340
This time, the truck was going to leave with or without me.

3379
02:34:44,500 --> 02:34:47,560
Which means the pollution wasn't my fault.

3380
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:48,320
Oh my god.

3381
02:34:48,420 --> 02:34:48,820
How convenient.

3382
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:53,600
I kinda hate Jesse sometimes.

3383
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:58,640
Oh my god!

3384
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:01,180
Hey, it's the concrete paparazzi.

3385
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:02,640
The concrete paparazzi.

3386
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:04,960
Ha!

3387
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:06,500
Such an asshole.

3388
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:07,720
But I like it.

3389
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,420
How's that escapee-ers going?

3390
02:35:09,740 --> 02:35:10,780
Making progress.

3391
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:13,460
I'm currently stowed away in a truck.

3392
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:15,340
Communications are hot.

3393
02:35:15,560 --> 02:35:17,040
You really pissed them off, Fox.

3394
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:19,980
I guess we're both gifted with pissing people off.

3395
02:35:20,460 --> 02:35:22,940
Sorry about the concrete joke, by the way.

3396
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:24,480
Nah, don't worry about it.

3397
02:35:24,480 --> 02:35:25,000
I don't get it.

3398
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:25,820
What's the concrete joke mean?

3399
02:35:25,820 --> 02:35:29,060
Better have a sense of humor about being jailed over some concrete blocks.

3400
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:31,160
By the way, you haven't seen it, right?

3401
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:32,080
Yes, that's right.

3402
02:35:33,880 --> 02:35:35,840
But nothing as big as you mentioned.

3403
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:36,900
Ah, well.

3404
02:35:37,460 --> 02:35:39,840
Send a postcard when you get home, my friend.

3405
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:40,420
Okay.

3406
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:40,780
Definitely.

3407
02:35:41,140 --> 02:35:42,020
Over and out.

3408
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:44,600
Just some boxes.

3409
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:48,000
I have no... I have no health.

3410
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:48,720
Foxy, over.

3411
02:35:49,180 --> 02:35:50,200
What is it, Fox?

3412
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:51,620
How were you captured?

3413
02:35:51,960 --> 02:35:54,460
We were heading to Kantor, a neutral zone.

3414
02:35:54,800 --> 02:35:57,840
When we were ambushed, no one else survived.

3415
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:02,180
I doubt anyone back at base expects me to be alive either.

3416
02:36:02,660 --> 02:36:03,000
I doubt anyone back at base expects me to be alive either.

3417
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:03,120
Hmm.

3418
02:36:03,880 --> 02:36:04,940
The truck stopped at last.

3419
02:36:05,620 --> 02:36:09,640
Its destination was a small port owned by the clandestine base.

3420
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:14,060
Looked like the truck was carrying packages to be transported by sea.

3421
02:36:14,360 --> 02:36:19,520
As we arrived, I overheard a conversation between the driver and a hangar officer.

3422
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:21,060
Huh.

3423
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:22,440
I thought it said French.

3424
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:25,800
Are you gonna tell me what the fuck you're bringing me at this time of night?

3425
02:36:26,140 --> 02:36:26,700
Sir.

3426
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:29,180
I have an order to send this load by sea.

3427
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:30,140
Fuck!

3428
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:31,880
You're waking me up for this?

3429
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:33,560
It's important, sir.

3430
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:34,620
I already told your officer.

3431
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:36,820
All maritime operations are cancelled.

3432
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:39,260
We're waiting for the nuclear warheads to arrive.

3433
02:36:39,380 --> 02:36:41,120
And we won't ship anything else.

3434
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:42,780
Until there's a new order.

3435
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:43,660
Hold on.

3436
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:45,200
You said nuclear warheads?

3437
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:47,720
Yes, that's what I heard them say.

3438
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:49,300
God save us.

3439
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:50,260
That's impossible.

3440
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:53,180
You sound just like the colonel.

3441
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:57,140
Oh, report to colonel about the nuclear warheads.

3442
02:36:57,600 --> 02:36:59,340
Colonel Harris, are you there?

3443
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:00,780
Here I am, son.

3444
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:02,560
You sound tense.

3445
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:03,760
Are you alright?

3446
02:37:03,960 --> 02:37:05,660
Why does it always go back to nukes, man?

3447
02:37:05,660 --> 02:37:06,320
I escaped in a truck.

3448
02:37:06,340 --> 02:37:08,080
I'm now in a hangar at a port.

3449
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:09,740
That's great news.

3450
02:37:10,100 --> 02:37:11,600
Find a phone and call.

3451
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:12,840
Not so fast, colonel.

3452
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:14,360
It's an ex-army port.

3453
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:15,640
I'm not safe yet.

3454
02:37:15,940 --> 02:37:16,680
Not safe?

3455
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:18,740
I have new information about Operation Jericho.

3456
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:20,860
Just overheard a conversation.

3457
02:37:21,320 --> 02:37:24,680
Sounds like they're waiting for nuclear warheads.

3458
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:25,880
That's impossible.

3459
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:26,740
Nuclear warheads?

3460
02:37:27,060 --> 02:37:28,020
That's impossible.

3461
02:37:28,460 --> 02:37:29,600
Are you certain?

3462
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:32,440
This can't be.

3463
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:35,660
You just can't pluck nuclear weapons out of thin air.

3464
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:37,660
They're extensively regulated.

3465
02:37:38,260 --> 02:37:40,160
Is it possible they stole them?

3466
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:44,200
We don't have any news about any theft in any country.

3467
02:37:44,340 --> 02:37:49,340
If they were stolen, either a country hid the fact, or it happened while I was captain here.

3468
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:52,180
Is it possible to build them?

3469
02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:54,540
These people have a lot of resources.

3470
02:37:55,120 --> 02:37:58,220
They need radioactive material and it can't be freely obtained.

3471
02:37:58,220 --> 02:38:00,920
We've been collecting radioactive material.

3472
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:03,600
We've been collecting radioactive material like this entire time.

3473
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:08,300
Whatever the case, they managed to acquire some.

3474
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:09,580
We've been collecting it.

3475
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:12,360
Hold on, Colonel.

3476
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:13,060
I heard something.

3477
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:15,400
Crap, they started the engine.

3478
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:16,740
I'll call you later.

3479
02:38:16,900 --> 02:38:18,980
I have to jump out before the truck drives off.

3480
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:21,560
It's scary.

3481
02:38:22,600 --> 02:38:23,080
Okay.

3482
02:38:24,060 --> 02:38:25,060
Close the door.

3483
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:27,740
Oh my gosh, now we're trapped in here.

3484
02:38:32,940 --> 02:38:34,220
Get out of the hangar.

3485
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:38,600
Let's collect a bunch of stuff first.

3486
02:38:38,700 --> 02:38:38,860
Let's collect a bunch of stuff first.

3487
02:38:38,860 --> 02:38:39,480
Yeah, yes.

3488
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:42,720
Yes, give me more health.

3489
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:43,160
Yes.

3490
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:46,180
Oh,

3491
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:53,310
that looks like a...

3492
02:38:53,310 --> 02:38:55,050
You guys, that looks like a nuclear warhead.

3493
02:38:55,810 --> 02:38:56,010
You guys, that looks like a nuclear warhead.

3494
02:38:56,010 --> 02:38:56,070
Maybe.

3495
02:39:02,050 --> 02:39:02,450
Nice.

3496
02:39:06,990 --> 02:39:07,470
I need that metal.

3497
02:39:14,110 --> 02:39:16,970
Can I use the binoculars in here?

3498
02:39:17,530 --> 02:39:17,810
Can I use the binoculars in here?

3499
02:39:17,810 --> 02:39:19,090
Oh, wait, not combined.

3500
02:39:19,630 --> 02:39:20,130
There we go.

3501
02:39:21,710 --> 02:39:22,370
Oh, I can.

3502
02:39:22,710 --> 02:39:23,650
Look at them!

3503
02:39:25,770 --> 02:39:26,650
Look at the guys.

3504
02:39:26,970 --> 02:39:27,250
Wait.

3505
02:39:29,030 --> 02:39:31,750
Okay, I think if I go down...

3506
02:39:31,750 --> 02:39:32,170
Oh!

3507
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:33,710
Hey, Leonard, look!

3508
02:39:33,950 --> 02:39:34,770
It's the prisoner!

3509
02:39:35,050 --> 02:39:35,810
How do you know who I am?

3510
02:39:35,830 --> 02:39:36,650
Leonard, not Mike.

3511
02:39:36,890 --> 02:39:38,330
These guys were Leonard's.

3512
02:39:38,330 --> 02:39:39,650
Mike doesn't fit engineers.

3513
02:39:39,990 --> 02:39:40,570
Quick!

3514
02:39:40,750 --> 02:39:41,670
Call for backup!

3515
02:39:41,950 --> 02:39:43,830
So they get the credit?

3516
02:39:44,190 --> 02:39:45,350
No way!

3517
02:39:46,090 --> 02:39:48,870
I'm fed up with them making fun of us.

3518
02:39:48,930 --> 02:39:50,670
Just because we're engineers.

3519
02:39:51,030 --> 02:39:51,850
Because we're Lennards.

3520
02:39:52,450 --> 02:39:56,030
They treat us like nobodies because we don't carry a rifle.

3521
02:39:56,210 --> 02:39:58,230
Our weapon is our intellect.

3522
02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:59,650
Do the controls!

3523
02:40:00,190 --> 02:40:02,770
We'll tell them we saw the prisoner.

3524
02:40:02,790 --> 02:40:03,230
No!

3525
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:04,950
No, don't do that!

3526
02:40:04,950 --> 02:40:06,090
Wait, I can't skip this!

3527
02:40:07,310 --> 02:40:08,330
Oh, come on.

3528
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:11,790
Guys, you're engineers.

3529
02:40:12,350 --> 02:40:14,430
Don't play soldiers with me, okay?

3530
02:40:15,370 --> 02:40:16,730
Come on, engineers.

3531
02:40:17,250 --> 02:40:17,670
Come on.

3532
02:40:17,670 --> 02:40:18,630
Let me pass.

3533
02:40:18,890 --> 02:40:20,510
I'll give you some trading cards.

3534
02:40:20,910 --> 02:40:21,970
Eat a dick!

3535
02:40:22,690 --> 02:40:22,970
Fine.

3536
02:40:23,430 --> 02:40:25,770
I don't know what you have on those computers.

3537
02:40:26,250 --> 02:40:28,870
But any unsaved work is going to get lost.

3538
02:40:29,330 --> 02:40:31,570
The saws were controlled by the terminals.

3539
02:40:31,910 --> 02:40:32,290
Okay.

3540
02:40:32,370 --> 02:40:33,830
I only had to destroy them.

3541
02:40:34,950 --> 02:40:35,830
There was a noise in the hangar.

3542
02:40:35,890 --> 02:40:38,470
A few explosions wouldn't draw any attention.

3543
02:40:38,830 --> 02:40:39,030
True.

3544
02:40:39,190 --> 02:40:41,850
But I had to be careful not to kill the engineers.

3545
02:40:42,110 --> 02:40:44,750
And heal them in case they got injured.

3546
02:40:45,070 --> 02:40:45,870
Oh, come on.

3547
02:40:45,870 --> 02:40:47,630
But they're just engineers.

3548
02:40:52,970 --> 02:40:54,570
I think I killed the engineer.

3549
02:40:55,150 --> 02:40:55,750
Uh-oh.

3550
02:40:56,010 --> 02:40:57,550
I think I killed the engineer.

3551
02:40:59,110 --> 02:41:00,870
You guys, I think I killed the engineer.

3552
02:41:01,850 --> 02:41:03,530
I think he's down!

3553
02:41:05,130 --> 02:41:05,810
Uh-oh.

3554
02:41:13,340 --> 02:41:15,680
How am I supposed to get past this thing?

3555
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:22,090
It's fine.

3556
02:41:22,150 --> 02:41:23,250
I would have game over it anyway.

3557
02:41:23,390 --> 02:41:23,950
Because of the guy.

3558
02:41:25,770 --> 02:41:26,210
Okay.

3559
02:41:27,730 --> 02:41:28,170
Gun.

3560
02:41:29,990 --> 02:41:30,430
Instead.

3561
02:41:36,140 --> 02:41:36,580
What?

3562
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:37,680
It explodes anyway?

3563
02:41:38,540 --> 02:41:39,380
Oh my god.

3564
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:41,160
Don't do this to me.

3565
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:44,140
How am I supposed to get past?

3566
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:45,240
Wait.

3567
02:41:46,180 --> 02:41:48,080
How am I supposed to get the third guy though?

3568
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:52,720
Wait, hold on.

3569
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:53,680
This seems like a puzzle.

3570
02:41:55,160 --> 02:41:56,460
Oh, I have this too.

3571
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:57,260
I have this too.

3572
02:41:57,520 --> 02:41:58,960
But it explodes anyway.

3573
02:41:59,120 --> 02:41:59,640
So it doesn't matter.

3574
02:42:01,180 --> 02:42:02,420
The third console.

3575
02:42:02,800 --> 02:42:03,200
Roll?

3576
02:42:03,340 --> 02:42:03,900
It doesn't work.

3577
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:05,040
I already tried that.

3578
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:07,840
Um...

3579
02:42:11,380 --> 02:42:13,440
It does like so little damage too.

3580
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:16,040
I don't want to waste all my uranium balls.

3581
02:42:18,180 --> 02:42:19,840
I don't want to waste all my uranium balls.

3582
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:20,800
I can't hold on to it too.

3583
02:42:23,820 --> 02:42:24,940
I can't hold on to it too.

3584
02:42:24,940 --> 02:42:27,480
I can't hold on to it too.

3585
02:42:35,090 --> 02:42:35,650
Okay.

3586
02:42:37,630 --> 02:42:38,550
Thank you.

3587
02:42:39,030 --> 02:42:39,890
Thank you guys.

3588
02:42:40,130 --> 02:42:40,570
Thank you.

3589
02:42:42,490 --> 02:42:43,710
What can we do?

3590
02:42:44,910 --> 02:42:46,230
What do you think they...

3591
02:42:46,230 --> 02:42:46,510
What?

3592
02:42:50,030 --> 02:42:50,590
Bless you.

3593
02:42:50,670 --> 02:42:50,950
Thank you.

3594
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:08,000
I like how they're just like gaming.

3595
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:10,060
Bless you.

3596
02:43:10,100 --> 02:43:10,440
Thank you.

3597
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:15,970
I can do this.

3598
02:43:21,830 --> 02:43:23,690
No, I can't.

3599
02:43:23,790 --> 02:43:24,750
Aw, dang it.

3600
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:28,970
The one time.

3601
02:43:30,090 --> 02:43:31,430
The one time.

3602
02:43:33,630 --> 02:43:34,230
Tasukawu.

3603
02:43:34,590 --> 02:43:35,450
Oh, grenade.

3604
02:43:35,890 --> 02:43:37,370
Oh, you guys are so...

3605
02:43:37,370 --> 02:43:37,650
Wait.

3606
02:43:38,010 --> 02:43:38,610
Okay.

3607
02:43:38,990 --> 02:43:40,550
We're going to have to be fast though.

3608
02:43:43,030 --> 02:43:43,570
Oh, gosh.

3609
02:43:43,790 --> 02:43:45,150
Okay, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

3610
02:43:48,710 --> 02:43:49,350
Oh, that was close.

3611
02:43:52,770 --> 02:43:53,050
Okay.

3612
02:43:53,230 --> 02:43:54,610
Um, um, um, um, um, um.

3613
02:43:57,290 --> 02:43:57,770
Oh my god.

3614
02:43:57,890 --> 02:43:58,070
No!

3615
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:03,870
Okay, I'm going to have to roll through that one probably.

3616
02:44:12,270 --> 02:44:12,550
Stupid.

3617
02:44:14,970 --> 02:44:15,890
This is so dumb.

3618
02:44:34,940 --> 02:44:36,020
Oh, come on!

3619
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:42,640
Oh, it's the saw in the end.

3620
02:44:42,780 --> 02:44:44,520
It's the saw in the end that gets me.

3621
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:50,380
I tried rolling even.

3622
02:44:51,980 --> 02:44:53,100
I even tried rolling.

3623
02:45:01,430 --> 02:45:02,790
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3624
02:45:02,830 --> 02:45:03,750
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3625
02:45:06,510 --> 02:45:07,010
Oh, wait.

3626
02:45:07,110 --> 02:45:07,690
No, no, no, no.

3627
02:45:07,710 --> 02:45:07,950
Sorry.

3628
02:45:07,950 --> 02:45:08,910
Um, you first.

3629
02:45:09,230 --> 02:45:10,030
No, no, no, no, no!

3630
02:45:11,070 --> 02:45:11,650
Oh, shit.

3631
02:45:11,730 --> 02:45:12,230
See, see, see.

3632
02:45:12,690 --> 02:45:13,610
He's fine, he's fine.

3633
02:45:19,560 --> 02:45:19,960
Oh!

3634
02:45:20,820 --> 02:45:21,720
Oh my god.

3635
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:31,040
There's three more guys.

3636
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:37,660
There's more saws.

3637
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:45,200
There's more saws.

3638
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:45,540
There's this guy.

3639
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:46,580
Okay, hold on.

3640
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:50,360
So it's just similar.

3641
02:45:52,180 --> 02:45:53,440
It's similar to before.

3642
02:45:53,800 --> 02:45:54,980
Where we nade him.

3643
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:57,120
And then...

3644
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:00,040
Probably do him first.

3645
02:46:00,600 --> 02:46:01,460
Save spot?

3646
02:46:02,340 --> 02:46:03,360
Oh, like here?

3647
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:07,080
You're right.

3648
02:46:22,420 --> 02:46:23,720
Okay, you first.

3649
02:46:26,880 --> 02:46:27,660
He's fine.

3650
02:46:29,100 --> 02:46:29,960
You're fine.

3651
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:31,260
You're fine.

3652
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:33,000
Everything is okay.

3653
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:34,660
Oh, wait.

3654
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:36,700
I think there was probably more health in there.

3655
02:46:38,040 --> 02:46:39,180
And I missed it.

3656
02:46:39,440 --> 02:46:39,900
No!

3657
02:46:41,700 --> 02:46:43,620
And that one right there, you see it?

3658
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:49,440
Yes, sir.

3659
02:46:52,260 --> 02:46:54,220
Still trying to figure out how to get out of here.

3660
02:46:54,600 --> 02:46:56,420
By the way, guess what?

3661
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:59,120
They have a mini rescue submarine.

3662
02:46:59,340 --> 02:46:59,680
Oh!

3663
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:00,540
Rescue?

3664
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:03,200
These people don't look like they go.

3665
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:07,120
I'm getting inside to have a look.

3666
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:09,140
Maybe I can ride it out of here.

3667
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:10,240
Mm-hmm.

3668
02:47:12,240 --> 02:47:13,120
But if...

3669
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:13,760
Oops, my bad.

3670
02:47:15,560 --> 02:47:16,860
If I go up...

3671
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:19,220
If I go past the saw...

3672
02:47:23,940 --> 02:47:24,980
I can get it now.

3673
02:47:26,440 --> 02:47:26,500
There we go.

3674
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:29,500
And get the grenade.

3675
02:47:31,380 --> 02:47:32,160
There we go.

3676
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:34,760
Just a little greedy.

3677
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:42,380
We made it.

3678
02:47:45,870 --> 02:47:46,770
But what's here?

3679
02:47:47,070 --> 02:47:49,810
I inspected the mini submarine before I left.

3680
02:47:50,070 --> 02:47:51,290
Okay, okay, okay.

3681
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:52,230
Sorry.

3682
02:47:52,470 --> 02:47:54,830
Trying to go out of the order of events.

3683
02:47:56,950 --> 02:47:58,530
What do we need for the submarine?

3684
02:47:58,830 --> 02:47:59,710
To leave.

3685
02:48:03,250 --> 02:48:04,150
What do we need?

3686
02:48:04,290 --> 02:48:06,470
Well, look at what we have here.

3687
02:48:07,990 --> 02:48:08,550
Files.

3688
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:11,650
Fittling with the controls, levers, and compartments...

3689
02:48:11,650 --> 02:48:11,870
Mm-hmm.

3690
02:48:11,930 --> 02:48:14,410
I managed to discover the submarine's logbook.

3691
02:48:14,510 --> 02:48:17,590
It contained details about its last mission.

3692
02:48:17,750 --> 02:48:19,010
A rescue operation.

3693
02:48:19,490 --> 02:48:22,390
The details didn't catch my attention at first.

3694
02:48:22,490 --> 02:48:22,790
Until?

3695
02:48:23,070 --> 02:48:27,010
But this logbook turned out to hold exactly the answers we were looking for.

3696
02:48:27,470 --> 02:48:28,770
But this logbook turned out to hold exactly the answers we were looking for.

3697
02:48:28,770 --> 02:48:28,850
Jelly.

3698
02:48:29,690 --> 02:48:30,270
What's that?

3699
02:48:30,470 --> 02:48:31,930
What were we looking for?

3700
02:48:34,970 --> 02:48:38,610
The fourth document was the logbook of a mini rescue submarine.

3701
02:48:38,990 --> 02:48:39,230
The fourth document was the logbook of a mini rescue submarine.

3702
02:48:39,530 --> 02:48:40,890
It mentioned its last mission.

3703
02:48:41,130 --> 02:48:44,010
A successful rescue operation from a week ago.

3704
02:48:44,130 --> 02:48:44,690
What did they rescue?

3705
02:48:44,830 --> 02:48:46,630
The target was a sinking submarine.

3706
02:48:46,970 --> 02:48:49,070
A submarine to rescue another submarine.

3707
02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:49,810
The K278 Consomolets.

3708
02:48:50,150 --> 02:48:52,730
Suffering from an onboard fire in the Barents Sea.

3709
02:48:53,030 --> 02:48:54,250
The Barents Sea?

3710
02:48:54,250 --> 02:48:54,370
We'll see.

3711
02:48:54,510 --> 02:48:57,830
Nuclear torpedoes were salvaged during the job.

3712
02:48:58,210 --> 02:49:01,770
The warheads involved in Operation Jericho.

3713
02:49:02,290 --> 02:49:06,010
The third file of Operation Jericho was quite revealing.

3714
02:49:06,490 --> 02:49:10,530
It had a map of the Kantor Province with exact coordinates.

3715
02:49:10,690 --> 02:49:11,330
Coordinates.

3716
02:49:11,470 --> 02:49:12,630
An ambush plan.

3717
02:49:12,970 --> 02:49:15,810
And a picture of the Colonel with his name under it.

3718
02:49:16,190 --> 02:49:19,950
Apparently their plan was to kidnap the Colonel without leaving a trace.

3719
02:49:20,030 --> 02:49:20,370
And they did!

3720
02:49:21,990 --> 02:49:23,270
Fire underwater?

3721
02:49:24,250 --> 02:49:25,630
Water in the fire.

3722
02:49:25,910 --> 02:49:26,130
Why?

3723
02:49:26,350 --> 02:49:27,290
It also had a map.

3724
02:49:27,570 --> 02:49:29,230
So those numbers could be...

3725
02:49:29,230 --> 02:49:31,330
The coordinates of attack routes.

3726
02:49:31,590 --> 02:49:33,730
Or potentially the attack targets themselves.

3727
02:49:34,130 --> 02:49:34,670
Oh my god.

3728
02:49:35,970 --> 02:49:38,290
Oh wait, we've already seen the other ones.

3729
02:49:39,170 --> 02:49:40,070
We've seen this.

3730
02:49:40,190 --> 02:49:41,190
We've seen this.

3731
02:49:41,230 --> 02:49:42,290
Okay, so we got more files.

3732
02:49:42,490 --> 02:49:43,010
Very cool.

3733
02:49:43,490 --> 02:49:47,910
Before leaving the submarine, I decided to report to Harris about the documents.

3734
02:49:48,330 --> 02:49:49,630
Okay, okay, okay.

3735
02:49:49,750 --> 02:49:51,210
Did you find anything, Fox?

3736
02:49:51,530 --> 02:49:52,090
Yes.

3737
02:49:54,250 --> 02:49:54,590
I reported at Mission.

3738
02:49:54,910 --> 02:49:59,550
It says, Mission Deep Rescue successfully completed.

3739
02:50:00,010 --> 02:50:01,030
Return date.

3740
02:50:01,430 --> 02:50:02,730
Fuck, a week ago.

3741
02:50:03,110 --> 02:50:04,390
I'll continue reading.

3742
02:50:04,590 --> 02:50:06,630
Rescue in the Barents Sea.

3743
02:50:08,030 --> 02:50:08,810
Submarine K270 Komsomolets.

3744
02:50:08,810 --> 02:50:11,090
We still don't even know who Jesse Fox is.

3745
02:50:11,230 --> 02:50:12,250
Like why he is here.

3746
02:50:13,170 --> 02:50:14,770
Have you heard of it?

3747
02:50:14,790 --> 02:50:16,170
Of course.

3748
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:19,950
It's a Soviet submarine that sank after catching fire.

3749
02:50:20,370 --> 02:50:23,670
But I can't think of any connection between these scum.

3750
02:50:23,670 --> 02:50:24,510
He's just a guy.

3751
02:50:25,570 --> 02:50:29,150
Maybe they're a Russian faction and went to rescue their comrades.

3752
02:50:29,590 --> 02:50:33,450
Or they could be trying to trade the crewmen for Russian nukes or something.

3753
02:50:33,630 --> 02:50:36,330
Fox, this wasn't a rescue mission.

3754
02:50:36,870 --> 02:50:40,790
But the log says the Komsomolets sank over a year ago.

3755
02:50:41,190 --> 02:50:43,550
There's not a soul alive down there.

3756
02:50:43,890 --> 02:50:46,250
It's not people they were hauling.

3757
02:50:46,530 --> 02:50:48,170
It was something else.

3758
02:50:48,310 --> 02:50:48,930
Concrete.

3759
02:50:49,110 --> 02:50:51,190
Colonel, what was the sub armed with?

3760
02:50:51,850 --> 02:50:52,470
Ghosts.

3761
02:50:53,670 --> 02:50:53,910
A nuclear torpedo.

3762
02:50:54,870 --> 02:50:56,490
There it is.

3763
02:50:56,550 --> 02:50:59,310
The nuclear warheads for operation Jericho.

3764
02:50:59,830 --> 02:51:04,150
Kindly donated by the Soviet Union in a game of finders keepers.

3765
02:51:04,550 --> 02:51:11,430
If what you say is true, they had to bring those torpedoes in by sea and take them to a lab.

3766
02:51:11,610 --> 02:51:15,110
The whole Komsomolet had been contaminated by the radiation.

3767
02:51:15,610 --> 02:51:18,690
Which means they would need a sarcophagus.

3768
02:51:18,950 --> 02:51:20,610
A sarcophagus?

3769
02:51:20,850 --> 02:51:22,790
Like the one for Tutankhamun?

3770
02:51:23,670 --> 02:51:24,890
Did you smoke something, Colonel?

3771
02:51:25,330 --> 02:51:26,750
Don't be an idiot, Fox.

3772
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:34,790
A sarcophagus is something that confines radiation, preventing everyone from dying while they transport the goods.

3773
02:51:35,070 --> 02:51:37,630
It has to be something thick.

3774
02:51:37,930 --> 02:51:38,650
Heavy.

3775
02:51:39,350 --> 02:51:40,450
Like concrete.

3776
02:51:40,630 --> 02:51:42,750
Two huge concrete blocks.

3777
02:51:43,330 --> 02:51:43,570
Yeah.

3778
02:51:43,870 --> 02:51:44,590
Robert!

3779
02:51:46,930 --> 02:51:48,030
What's up, Colonel?

3780
02:51:48,530 --> 02:51:49,550
I hear footsteps.

3781
02:51:50,490 --> 02:51:52,050
Soldiers are walking down the hall.

3782
02:51:52,610 --> 02:51:53,430
Damn it.

3783
02:51:53,710 --> 02:51:55,010
I think my time is up.

3784
02:51:55,010 --> 02:51:55,570
No, Colonel!

3785
02:51:56,150 --> 02:51:57,250
Listen to me carefully, son.

3786
02:51:57,470 --> 02:51:58,770
The situation is critical.

3787
02:51:59,210 --> 02:52:02,970
You have to escape as soon as possible and call the Cavalier.

3788
02:52:04,050 --> 02:52:04,570
Cavalier?

3789
02:52:04,710 --> 02:52:05,770
Is that not cavalry?

3790
02:52:07,190 --> 02:52:08,550
Colonel Harris out.

3791
02:52:08,830 --> 02:52:11,750
That was my final communication with Colonel Harris.

3792
02:52:11,930 --> 02:52:12,030
No!

3793
02:52:12,030 --> 02:52:12,410
My God!

3794
02:52:12,570 --> 02:52:12,950
Really?

3795
02:52:14,330 --> 02:52:15,190
Oh my gosh.

3796
02:52:15,470 --> 02:52:16,850
Colonel, do you copy?

3797
02:52:19,550 --> 02:52:20,310
You must have been taken.

3798
02:52:20,470 --> 02:52:20,970
Oh my God.

3799
02:52:21,770 --> 02:52:23,190
The Colonel is gone.

3800
02:52:23,250 --> 02:52:24,530
Robert, do you copy?

3801
02:52:25,830 --> 02:52:28,090
Fox looks like they're going to transfer a prisoner.

3802
02:52:28,390 --> 02:52:30,230
Someone called Alan Harris.

3803
02:52:30,670 --> 02:52:31,350
I know.

3804
02:52:31,590 --> 02:52:33,090
Do you know what they plan to do?

3805
02:52:33,410 --> 02:52:35,710
They're going to tickle him.

3806
02:52:35,810 --> 02:52:37,710
It looks like the orders are coming from top brass.

3807
02:52:38,210 --> 02:52:39,970
You're really pissing them off, my friend.

3808
02:52:40,190 --> 02:52:41,030
Be careful.

3809
02:52:41,570 --> 02:52:43,270
Maybe they'll use him against you.

3810
02:52:43,370 --> 02:52:45,210
We don't even know this guy.

3811
02:52:45,590 --> 02:52:48,570
By the way, I have something to tell you about your concrete.

3812
02:52:49,550 --> 02:52:50,030
Tell me him.

3813
02:52:50,310 --> 02:52:51,290
Man, you rock.

3814
02:52:51,830 --> 02:52:53,190
I don't know where they are.

3815
02:52:53,390 --> 02:52:55,490
But they've been used as a sarcophagus.

3816
02:52:56,370 --> 02:52:57,250
A sarcophagus?

3817
02:52:57,590 --> 02:52:59,130
Like the one for Tutton Common?

3818
02:52:59,750 --> 02:53:01,210
Did you smoke something, Fox?

3819
02:53:01,450 --> 02:53:02,790
I had a feeling he was going to say that.

3820
02:53:03,110 --> 02:53:05,570
I mean a thick container to contain radiation.

3821
02:53:06,370 --> 02:53:06,810
Radiation?

3822
02:53:07,450 --> 02:53:09,110
Please tell me they're not nukes.

3823
02:53:09,630 --> 02:53:10,270
They are.

3824
02:53:10,470 --> 02:53:12,410
From a sunken Soviet submarine.

3825
02:53:12,790 --> 02:53:13,350
Oh my God.

3826
02:53:13,490 --> 02:53:13,770
Shit.

3827
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:16,530
That's why there's so much secrecy and surveillance.

3828
02:53:16,650 --> 02:53:17,410
Oh my God.

3829
02:53:17,550 --> 02:53:18,170
Cheer up, Robert.

3830
02:53:18,390 --> 02:53:18,990
Cheer up?

3831
02:53:19,550 --> 02:53:20,890
This isn't for something trivial anymore.

3832
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:23,670
It's for a nuclear arms race.

3833
02:53:24,470 --> 02:53:24,910
Yippee!

3834
02:53:25,590 --> 02:53:27,030
This news is da bomb.

3835
02:53:27,590 --> 02:53:29,930
That's a literal way to say it.

3836
02:53:30,210 --> 02:53:31,690
Keep me informed, my friend.

3837
02:53:31,890 --> 02:53:33,330
I want to know all the deets.

3838
02:53:33,350 --> 02:53:35,250
Yeah, he wants to know all the deets so he can report it.

3839
02:53:35,290 --> 02:53:35,810
Over and out.

3840
02:53:35,890 --> 02:53:40,290
He wants to report it and be like, I'm the guy who figured all this out.

3841
02:53:40,550 --> 02:53:42,270
I think Robert's going to betray us.

3842
02:53:42,810 --> 02:53:43,870
I don't trust Robert.

3843
02:53:45,250 --> 02:53:46,210
Why did it save?

3844
02:53:46,930 --> 02:53:48,150
Why did the game just save?

3845
02:53:50,150 --> 02:53:54,490
Why are there so many missiles here, then?

3846
02:53:55,730 --> 02:53:57,510
Why is there a recycling bin?

3847
02:53:59,210 --> 02:53:59,570
Hmm.

3848
02:54:03,690 --> 02:54:04,050
Wait.

3849
02:54:04,170 --> 02:54:05,510
I guess we would leap through there.

3850
02:54:05,590 --> 02:54:05,930
But hold on.

3851
02:54:05,990 --> 02:54:06,770
Let's check this out first.

3852
02:54:08,250 --> 02:54:09,190
That's a recyc- Oh!

3853
02:54:09,230 --> 02:54:09,350
No!

3854
02:54:11,230 --> 02:54:11,590
Wait.

3855
02:54:13,490 --> 02:54:15,750
He's so environmentally conscious.

3856
02:54:15,750 --> 02:54:17,290
To get rid of some stuff.

3857
02:54:17,610 --> 02:54:19,970
But couldn't you just toss them on the ground?

3858
02:54:20,230 --> 02:54:22,850
Are you taking me for some sort of shitbag?

3859
02:54:23,090 --> 02:54:24,530
You were behind enemy lines.

3860
02:54:24,810 --> 02:54:25,930
It wouldn't be unreasonable.

3861
02:54:26,670 --> 02:54:29,490
He was like a protester or something.

3862
02:54:30,710 --> 02:54:31,530
I see.

3863
02:54:31,990 --> 02:54:35,210
Now, why did you get rid of items that may be handy later?

3864
02:54:35,430 --> 02:54:40,110
Because the more stuff you have, the more you're a slave to your own possessions.

3865
02:54:40,250 --> 02:54:44,450
And nothing enslaves me.

3866
02:54:45,750 --> 02:54:47,770
I threw away everything that I didn't need.

3867
02:54:48,070 --> 02:54:51,170
An act that's common to minimalists such as yourself.

3868
02:54:51,890 --> 02:54:52,410
Minimalist?

3869
02:54:52,510 --> 02:54:52,930
Me?

3870
02:54:53,470 --> 02:54:54,870
Where'd you get that stupid idea?

3871
02:54:55,410 --> 02:54:56,570
Take a look at yourself.

3872
02:54:56,930 --> 02:54:58,410
You look angry and disappointed.

3873
02:54:58,970 --> 02:55:01,230
As if you're having minimalist intercourse.

3874
02:55:01,470 --> 02:55:02,630
How dare you!

3875
02:55:03,190 --> 02:55:03,970
Relax, Sergeant.

3876
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:06,190
It's obvious what Mr. Fox is trying to do.

3877
02:55:06,650 --> 02:55:08,170
We've been here for a long time.

3878
02:55:08,270 --> 02:55:08,890
We're tired.

3879
02:55:09,090 --> 02:55:10,430
Even slightly agitated.

3880
02:55:11,410 --> 02:55:12,970
I'm a slave to my possessions.

3881
02:55:13,110 --> 02:55:15,590
My anime girl possessions.

3882
02:55:16,330 --> 02:55:21,210
Hoping I attack him and provide an officer misconduct charge that enables him to be set free.

3883
02:55:21,410 --> 02:55:24,490
But that is not going to work, Mr. Fox.

3884
02:55:25,110 --> 02:55:27,990
Look, I'm used to interrogating assholes like you.

3885
02:55:28,550 --> 02:55:29,030
Fuck.

3886
02:55:29,230 --> 02:55:30,470
You got me, officer.

3887
02:55:30,590 --> 02:55:32,610
I underestimated you.

3888
02:55:33,030 --> 02:55:33,510
Fuck.

3889
02:55:33,670 --> 02:55:35,850
I have to admit that you're very good.

3890
02:55:36,290 --> 02:55:37,410
Pretty good, in fact.

3891
02:55:39,530 --> 02:55:41,990
Yeah, well, let's continue.

3892
02:55:41,990 --> 02:55:42,830
I'm getting flustered.

3893
02:55:43,410 --> 02:55:44,710
You said that you got rid of some items.

3894
02:55:44,950 --> 02:55:45,250
Yeah.

3895
02:55:49,740 --> 02:55:51,200
Wait, this is a lot of stuff.

3896
02:55:51,640 --> 02:55:52,760
No, my chloroform!

3897
02:55:54,120 --> 02:55:54,840
I guess...

3898
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:55,860
Well, we still have the...

3899
02:55:57,980 --> 02:55:58,700
The wrapper.

3900
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:00,080
Oh, we got a key.

3901
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:02,940
Oh, wow.

3902
02:56:03,020 --> 02:56:04,160
They got rid of a lot of stuff.

3903
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:06,840
I guess this is, what, halfway point of the game then?

3904
02:56:07,400 --> 02:56:08,900
Or am I a little further?

3905
02:56:10,700 --> 02:56:13,020
We don't need cigarettes in our stomach anymore.

3906
02:56:13,240 --> 02:56:14,900
I never even used a cigarette.

3907
02:56:15,600 --> 02:56:17,020
Wait, was there anything over here?

3908
02:56:20,830 --> 02:56:21,290
Oh.

3909
02:56:21,950 --> 02:56:22,410
Nope.

3910
02:56:33,590 --> 02:56:34,510
Weird area.

3911
02:56:34,830 --> 02:56:35,970
I know, it makes me...

3912
02:56:37,850 --> 02:56:39,010
Feel like there's a secret.

3913
02:56:41,370 --> 02:56:42,610
Is there a secret in there?

3914
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:46,910
Can you punch the nukes?

3915
02:56:49,450 --> 02:56:49,910
Oh!

3916
02:56:49,910 --> 02:56:49,950
Oh!

3917
02:56:51,230 --> 02:56:51,630
Wait,

3918
02:56:55,740 --> 02:56:56,760
where am I supposed to go from here?

3919
02:56:56,900 --> 02:56:57,780
What's this key?

3920
02:56:58,360 --> 02:56:58,760
Key.

3921
02:56:58,940 --> 02:56:59,620
Oh, okay.

3922
02:57:01,100 --> 02:57:02,260
Maybe to the front door.

3923
02:57:04,240 --> 02:57:06,020
I'm scared of punching the nukes, you guys.

3924
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:07,900
I don't want to do that again twice.

3925
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:09,560
Oh!

3926
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:11,200
Okay.

3927
02:57:26,740 --> 02:57:27,260
This way?

3928
02:57:27,880 --> 02:57:28,280
Here?

3929
02:57:33,860 --> 02:57:34,340
Um.

3930
02:57:35,140 --> 02:57:37,180
The key didn't fit in the lock.

3931
02:57:38,060 --> 02:57:39,580
Well, where does it go then?

3932
02:57:45,070 --> 02:57:47,470
Does it go in the sub?

3933
02:57:47,770 --> 02:57:48,250
Marine?

3934
02:57:53,810 --> 02:57:54,750
To the sub?

3935
02:57:54,890 --> 02:57:55,070
Yeah.

3936
02:57:55,110 --> 02:57:56,170
I guess we're gonna try that.

3937
02:58:04,140 --> 02:58:05,100
Sub time?

3938
02:58:09,570 --> 02:58:10,050
Alright.

3939
02:58:11,330 --> 02:58:11,810
Okay.

3940
02:58:12,830 --> 02:58:16,310
After putting the key in the lock and turning it, the sub started to move.

3941
02:58:16,770 --> 02:58:20,970
I took the mini-submarine through underground channels beneath the hangar.

3942
02:58:21,350 --> 02:58:21,830
Seriously?

3943
02:58:22,130 --> 02:58:23,870
Now you can drive mini-submarines?

3944
02:58:24,430 --> 02:58:24,910
Nope.

3945
02:58:25,090 --> 02:58:26,850
Never done it before in my life.

3946
02:58:27,150 --> 02:58:28,650
But, I found a manual.

3947
02:58:28,810 --> 02:58:29,010
Wow.

3948
02:58:29,270 --> 02:58:30,350
Can you read Russian?

3949
02:58:30,590 --> 02:58:32,450
Oh, I was gonna think, can you read?

3950
02:58:32,630 --> 02:58:33,090
It was in English.

3951
02:58:33,190 --> 02:58:34,890
The mini-submarine was American.

3952
02:58:35,370 --> 02:58:37,050
It was a pretty smooth ride.

3953
02:58:37,590 --> 02:58:40,630
I didn't have to worry about the battery levels, oxygen...

3954
02:58:40,630 --> 02:58:41,110
Cinderella!

3955
02:58:42,830 --> 02:58:43,730
It was very comfortable.

3956
02:58:44,110 --> 02:58:45,990
I could practically live in there.

3957
02:58:46,530 --> 02:58:47,710
Well, of course.

3958
02:58:47,850 --> 02:58:49,750
It's an American product.

3959
02:58:50,150 --> 02:58:51,030
What did you expect?

3960
02:58:51,510 --> 02:58:54,450
Yeah, but you know how American vehicles are.

3961
02:58:54,670 --> 02:58:55,290
What are you trying to say?

3962
02:58:55,290 --> 02:58:57,210
They practically explode on contact.

3963
02:58:57,510 --> 02:58:57,970
Okay, that's true.

3964
02:58:57,970 --> 02:58:59,110
Ever seen an action movie?

3965
02:58:59,650 --> 02:59:02,630
Anyways, that's why I avoided any hard collisions.

3966
02:59:02,670 --> 02:59:03,410
Oh gosh, okay.

3967
02:59:06,030 --> 02:59:08,690
Up, down, left, right to move the submarine.

3968
02:59:09,530 --> 02:59:10,410
Oh gosh.

3969
02:59:10,410 --> 02:59:12,670
Oh, it has these kinds of physics.

3970
02:59:13,350 --> 02:59:14,010
Okay.

3971
02:59:14,830 --> 02:59:15,790
Oh gosh.

3972
02:59:16,570 --> 02:59:17,230
Oh!

3973
02:59:17,670 --> 02:59:18,330
No!

3974
02:59:20,690 --> 02:59:21,350
What?

3975
02:59:33,140 --> 02:59:34,760
My HP was dropping.

3976
02:59:39,780 --> 02:59:40,980
Oh, is it because...

3977
02:59:40,980 --> 02:59:42,020
Oh, I see.

3978
02:59:42,340 --> 02:59:44,240
Oh my gosh, I can't hit anything.

3979
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:46,220
Oh my god.

3980
02:59:46,220 --> 02:59:47,960
Oh my god.

3981
02:59:48,140 --> 02:59:49,080
I see, I see.

3982
02:59:49,860 --> 02:59:51,660
You drop HP upon impact.

3983
02:59:52,360 --> 02:59:53,900
Oh, that's too difficult.

3984
02:59:59,330 --> 02:59:59,930
Okay.

3985
03:00:02,950 --> 03:00:04,750
Smooth ride my ass.

3986
03:00:11,680 --> 03:00:12,280
Smooth ride my ass.

3987
03:00:12,280 --> 03:00:13,120
I don't think I'll fit through there.

3988
03:00:14,440 --> 03:00:14,740
Smooth.

3989
03:00:21,510 --> 03:00:22,110
Smooth.

3990
03:00:22,750 --> 03:00:23,350
Ride.

3991
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:26,310
My butt.

3992
03:00:29,070 --> 03:00:30,670
I don't even know if this is the right way.

3993
03:00:30,690 --> 03:00:32,150
There was like that down way.

3994
03:00:38,410 --> 03:00:40,070
Maybe I should have gone the other way.

3995
03:00:40,070 --> 03:00:40,790
What was the other way though?

3996
03:00:44,170 --> 03:00:45,470
Can I go back in?

3997
03:00:46,010 --> 03:00:46,850
Wait, there's a bathroom.

3998
03:00:51,580 --> 03:00:53,260
It plays an old song called smooth.

3999
03:00:53,420 --> 03:00:54,500
Smooth operator.

4000
03:00:56,740 --> 03:00:57,620
Smooth operator.

4001
03:01:17,930 --> 03:01:18,810
Is this...

4002
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:29,480
Okay.

4003
03:01:29,660 --> 03:01:31,060
It's a good thing we came here first then.

4004
03:01:33,080 --> 03:01:33,440
Okay.

4005
03:01:35,440 --> 03:01:36,160
Oh my gosh.

4006
03:01:36,300 --> 03:01:37,080
No, no.

4007
03:01:37,120 --> 03:01:38,080
I have to go back through it?

4008
03:01:39,140 --> 03:01:41,340
Press space to shoot torpedoes.

4009
03:01:47,820 --> 03:01:48,180
Ouch.

4010
03:01:49,820 --> 03:01:50,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4011
03:02:00,910 --> 03:02:01,870
Did they get shorter?

4012
03:02:02,170 --> 03:02:02,930
Is it just me?

4013
03:02:05,390 --> 03:02:05,750
No.

4014
03:02:06,330 --> 03:02:06,970
Oh my gosh.

4015
03:02:14,590 --> 03:02:15,410
Shoot the mines?

4016
03:02:15,530 --> 03:02:16,490
But what if they explode?

4017
03:02:16,630 --> 03:02:17,850
And I explode with them?

4018
03:02:18,030 --> 03:02:20,730
I don't want to shoot them if they're too close to them.

4019
03:02:20,910 --> 03:02:20,990
You know?

4020
03:02:25,590 --> 03:02:27,110
I don't want the splash damage.

4021
03:02:27,690 --> 03:02:28,710
That's what I'm trying to say.

4022
03:02:31,470 --> 03:02:31,870
Okay.

4023
03:02:32,610 --> 03:02:33,230
Let's go.

4024
03:02:35,810 --> 03:02:36,350
Let's go.

4025
03:02:37,490 --> 03:02:38,070
Let's go.

4026
03:02:39,710 --> 03:02:40,490
Oh my gosh.

4027
03:02:40,990 --> 03:02:41,790
No way!

4028
03:02:41,790 --> 03:02:43,190
There's one of those things.

4029
03:02:43,410 --> 03:02:46,210
That's gonna like...

4030
03:02:56,460 --> 03:02:57,140
Okay.

4031
03:02:58,620 --> 03:03:00,240
Oh, this is gonna be...

4032
03:03:00,760 --> 03:03:01,960
This is gonna be torture.

4033
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:09,880
How...

4034
03:03:09,880 --> 03:03:11,260
Maybe if I go up...

4035
03:03:11,260 --> 03:03:13,140
Was there a little pocket upwards?

4036
03:03:13,840 --> 03:03:14,300
Hmm.

4037
03:03:20,760 --> 03:03:23,220
You ate that torpedo for breakfast.

4038
03:03:24,240 --> 03:03:24,920
Yeah.

4039
03:03:25,660 --> 03:03:26,600
And then...

4040
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:28,260
I had food poisoning.

4041
03:03:31,500 --> 03:03:32,580
Okay, but let me...

4042
03:03:32,580 --> 03:03:34,000
Okay, since we're here though...

4043
03:03:34,800 --> 03:03:36,560
Since we already died once...

4044
03:03:36,560 --> 03:03:38,540
Let's just try the torpedoes here.

4045
03:03:39,020 --> 03:03:39,980
See if it works.

4046
03:03:41,600 --> 03:03:42,180
You know?

4047
03:03:42,640 --> 03:03:44,500
Oh, my HP is back to full.

4048
03:03:49,720 --> 03:03:52,480
I got one at least.

4049
03:03:52,700 --> 03:03:52,860
Oh.

4050
03:03:54,260 --> 03:03:55,540
Hold on.

4051
03:03:55,640 --> 03:03:56,380
There we go.

4052
03:03:56,840 --> 03:03:57,480
Okay.

4053
03:03:57,580 --> 03:03:59,940
The angle is a little awkward, you know?

4054
03:04:00,660 --> 03:04:00,980
So...

4055
03:04:01,980 --> 03:04:03,020
Mm-hmm.

4056
03:04:03,300 --> 03:04:04,120
Mm-hmm.

4057
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:05,680
Okay.

4058
03:04:06,100 --> 03:04:06,960
Good enough.

4059
03:04:09,080 --> 03:04:10,500
Here we go.

4060
03:04:10,620 --> 03:04:12,820
All right.

4061
03:04:24,580 --> 03:04:25,220
Yeah!

4062
03:04:29,080 --> 03:04:29,720
Okay.

4063
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:31,680
Ha-ha-ha.

4064
03:04:32,360 --> 03:04:33,280
All right.

4065
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:35,320
This part...

4066
03:04:35,800 --> 03:04:37,000
Oh, there is a pocket!

4067
03:04:37,140 --> 03:04:37,760
There is a pocket!

4068
03:04:42,520 --> 03:04:42,900
No!

4069
03:04:43,040 --> 03:04:44,460
I don't think I got anything though!

4070
03:04:47,400 --> 03:04:47,780
Ouch.

4071
03:04:47,780 --> 03:04:48,280
Oh, no!

4072
03:04:48,360 --> 03:04:48,840
My health!

4073
03:05:06,770 --> 03:05:08,770
You think I can go back and save?

4074
03:05:10,910 --> 03:05:12,730
You think I can go back and save maybe?

4075
03:05:12,910 --> 03:05:13,450
I wonder.

4076
03:05:27,380 --> 03:05:27,760
Oh!

4077
03:05:28,460 --> 03:05:28,900
Oh!

4078
03:05:31,780 --> 03:05:32,220
Okay.

4079
03:05:40,530 --> 03:05:40,970
Okay.

4080
03:05:41,490 --> 03:05:42,190
All right.

4081
03:05:42,830 --> 03:05:43,730
Oh, my God!

4082
03:05:43,830 --> 03:05:44,270
Oh, my God!

4083
03:05:45,910 --> 03:05:46,890
We'll blow these up.

4084
03:05:49,150 --> 03:05:50,490
I thought we would.

4085
03:05:51,910 --> 03:05:52,350
Okay.

4086
03:05:58,750 --> 03:06:00,490
And we'll grab more missiles too.

4087
03:06:01,470 --> 03:06:02,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4088
03:06:02,610 --> 03:06:03,270
All right.

4089
03:06:05,070 --> 03:06:06,230
Oh, come on!

4090
03:06:06,230 --> 03:06:08,050
That would have...

4091
03:06:08,050 --> 03:06:09,670
That should have...

4092
03:06:09,990 --> 03:06:10,870
That should have hit.

4093
03:06:11,050 --> 03:06:11,530
There we go.

4094
03:06:11,770 --> 03:06:12,410
Okay.

4095
03:06:12,550 --> 03:06:13,150
Perfect.

4096
03:06:15,570 --> 03:06:16,210
Okay.

4097
03:06:22,120 --> 03:06:23,700
The Texas jokes.

4098
03:06:23,820 --> 03:06:23,920
Oh!

4099
03:06:24,160 --> 03:06:25,020
Hello again!

4100
03:06:25,600 --> 03:06:27,300
The parody is a full metal jacket.

4101
03:06:30,180 --> 03:06:31,560
They were so funny.

4102
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:36,380
Ha-ha-ha.

4103
03:06:36,760 --> 03:06:36,900
Ha-ha-ha.

4104
03:06:38,320 --> 03:06:40,140
I figured it out first try though.

4105
03:06:40,300 --> 03:06:40,740
Right, everybody?

4106
03:06:43,100 --> 03:06:43,980
Yes, me too.

4107
03:06:44,900 --> 03:06:45,700
Yes, sir.

4108
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:52,540
I'm not a shit state.

4109
03:06:52,980 --> 03:06:53,640
Ha-ha-ha.

4110
03:06:54,660 --> 03:06:55,740
First try.

4111
03:07:03,440 --> 03:07:04,020
Nice.

4112
03:07:04,940 --> 03:07:05,820
All right.

4113
03:07:05,820 --> 03:07:06,800
Here we go.

4114
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:08,700
Onwards.

4115
03:07:09,660 --> 03:07:10,240
Oop.

4116
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:15,220
And I noticed something in the other room.

4117
03:07:15,980 --> 03:07:18,420
The one that had the...

4118
03:07:20,440 --> 03:07:21,200
Oh my gosh.

4119
03:07:21,220 --> 03:07:22,580
My health is not okay though.

4120
03:07:22,780 --> 03:07:23,340
Ha-ha-ha.

4121
03:07:24,040 --> 03:07:26,500
Maybe I should die and then load from the...

4122
03:07:30,320 --> 03:07:32,460
See that wall over there is kind of cracked.

4123
03:07:40,900 --> 03:07:41,760
Oh, ouch!

4124
03:07:41,920 --> 03:07:42,260
Oh!

4125
03:07:43,220 --> 03:07:43,740
I

4126
03:07:55,480 --> 03:07:56,780
thought it was a different room.

4127
03:07:57,280 --> 03:07:58,200
Ha-ha-ha.

4128
03:07:59,360 --> 03:07:59,880
I thought it was a different room.

4129
03:07:59,880 --> 03:08:00,020
Ha -ha-ha.

4130
03:08:00,020 --> 03:08:00,160
I thought it was a different room.

4131
03:08:00,180 --> 03:08:00,440
Ha -ha-ha.

4132
03:08:01,240 --> 03:08:03,440
I thought it was a...

4133
03:08:05,180 --> 03:08:07,300
I thought it was a...

4134
03:08:07,300 --> 03:08:07,760
I thought it was a...

4135
03:08:07,760 --> 03:08:08,400
Ha-ha-ha.

4136
03:08:10,280 --> 03:08:11,880
Oh my gosh.

4137
03:08:12,580 --> 03:08:13,080
Oh my gosh.

4138
03:08:15,410 --> 03:08:15,970
No!

4139
03:08:16,990 --> 03:08:18,210
Oh, there we go.

4140
03:08:18,290 --> 03:08:18,450
Okay.

4141
03:08:18,610 --> 03:08:19,030
Oh, see?

4142
03:08:19,230 --> 03:08:20,870
Our health is okay though.

4143
03:08:21,630 --> 03:08:22,510
Good, good, good.

4144
03:08:28,560 --> 03:08:31,000
Jesse doesn't die, it contradicts his story.

4145
03:08:31,260 --> 03:08:31,980
Ha-ha-ha.

4146
03:08:32,240 --> 03:08:33,080
So true.

4147
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:33,700
My bad.

4148
03:08:35,120 --> 03:08:35,300
Yeah.

4149
03:08:40,120 --> 03:08:41,840
I'm getting pretty good at this though, I think.

4150
03:08:42,400 --> 03:08:44,760
I think I'm getting pretty good at the...

4151
03:08:44,760 --> 03:08:46,060
I think I'm getting pretty good at the...

4152
03:08:46,060 --> 03:08:47,580
this whole driving thing.

4153
03:08:49,380 --> 03:08:50,260
Yeah, baby.

4154
03:08:51,640 --> 03:08:52,080
Ouch.

4155
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:53,000
Ouch.

4156
03:08:53,620 --> 03:08:54,480
Oh, come on.

4157
03:08:54,800 --> 03:08:56,200
This thing is like the...

4158
03:08:56,200 --> 03:08:58,680
most delicate submarine in the world.

4159
03:08:59,560 --> 03:08:59,760
most delicate submarine in the world.

4160
03:09:06,470 --> 03:09:06,910
Most...

4161
03:09:06,910 --> 03:09:07,490
Oh my gosh.

4162
03:09:07,650 --> 03:09:09,130
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4163
03:09:09,770 --> 03:09:10,790
Oh my gosh.

4164
03:09:10,910 --> 03:09:10,910
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

4165
03:09:17,860 --> 03:09:18,880
I took some hits.

4166
03:09:18,980 --> 03:09:20,240
I took some hits, but...

4167
03:09:21,160 --> 03:09:21,540
Um...

4168
03:09:21,540 --> 03:09:23,420
Wait, how am I supposed to get past these?

4169
03:09:24,300 --> 03:09:26,640
Oh wait, I think if I go like this...

4170
03:09:26,640 --> 03:09:26,800
Ah!

4171
03:09:27,200 --> 03:09:28,420
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

4172
03:09:35,050 --> 03:09:35,630
There we go.

4173
03:09:40,420 --> 03:09:41,180
Pogo ride?

4174
03:09:41,300 --> 03:09:41,860
Poco ride?

4175
03:09:42,040 --> 03:09:42,960
Oh, thanks for the raid!

4176
03:09:44,240 --> 03:09:46,020
It doesn't give me alerts anymore.

4177
03:09:46,360 --> 03:09:47,480
When someone raids me.

4178
03:09:48,200 --> 03:09:49,240
Thank you so much!

4179
03:09:57,260 --> 03:09:59,240
I'm doing the tiniest little bonks.

4180
03:09:59,620 --> 03:10:00,980
I'm playing a game.

4181
03:10:01,320 --> 03:10:03,240
It's a parody of Metal Gear.

4182
03:10:03,660 --> 03:10:04,780
Rareby, thanks for the 20!

4183
03:10:05,240 --> 03:10:06,220
Oh my god.

4184
03:10:06,300 --> 03:10:07,340
Oh, no, no, no, no.

4185
03:10:10,860 --> 03:10:12,700
But it's a very silly game.

4186
03:10:14,940 --> 03:10:16,800
Right now, we're trying to escape.

4187
03:10:17,480 --> 03:10:18,720
In a submarine, and it's...

4188
03:10:18,720 --> 03:10:20,020
A little tricky.

4189
03:10:22,200 --> 03:10:23,160
And requires...

4190
03:10:24,120 --> 03:10:24,600
Maneuvering...

4191
03:10:25,260 --> 03:10:27,440
Of impeccable timing...

4192
03:10:27,440 --> 03:10:28,720
And strength.

4193
03:10:30,860 --> 03:10:31,820
Oh, come on!

4194
03:10:32,120 --> 03:10:33,280
Okay, I'm gonna go...

4195
03:10:33,280 --> 03:10:34,980
After I destroy these, I'm gonna go save again.

4196
03:10:42,130 --> 03:10:43,070
That should be...

4197
03:10:43,070 --> 03:10:44,590
Yeah, okay, let's go save.

4198
03:10:44,950 --> 03:10:45,930
You can do it, company!

4199
03:10:46,150 --> 03:10:46,710
Thanks, Poco!

4200
03:10:46,970 --> 03:10:47,790
Thanks for the raid!

4201
03:10:49,670 --> 03:10:50,470
We should...

4202
03:10:52,930 --> 03:10:54,150
Okay, okay, okay.

4203
03:10:54,390 --> 03:10:55,190
Okay, oh gosh.

4204
03:10:59,830 --> 03:11:02,150
Oh my gosh, I can't hit any walls, you guys.

4205
03:11:02,330 --> 03:11:02,590
Ow!

4206
03:11:02,910 --> 03:11:03,310
No!

4207
03:11:03,510 --> 03:11:04,730
All I say is I hit a wall.

4208
03:11:06,370 --> 03:11:06,810
Okay.

4209
03:11:07,730 --> 03:11:08,970
Can I use potty?

4210
03:11:08,970 --> 03:11:09,130
No.

4211
03:11:09,330 --> 03:11:10,170
I don't think so.

4212
03:11:10,330 --> 03:11:11,710
I don't think I can, at least.

4213
03:11:11,850 --> 03:11:13,970
I don't wanna... I'm like too glued...

4214
03:11:13,970 --> 03:11:14,530
To the...

4215
03:11:15,450 --> 03:11:16,130
To the...

4216
03:11:17,990 --> 03:11:18,430
Arrows?

4217
03:11:18,430 --> 03:11:19,210
The airbows?

4218
03:11:20,250 --> 03:11:21,650
The keyboard arrows?

4219
03:11:22,250 --> 03:11:23,390
That I don't wanna...

4220
03:11:23,870 --> 03:11:25,290
I don't wanna trust it at all.

4221
03:11:25,490 --> 03:11:26,230
I'm scared.

4222
03:11:26,730 --> 03:11:27,610
Oh gosh.

4223
03:11:29,390 --> 03:11:30,530
Okay, forward!

4224
03:11:31,710 --> 03:11:32,190
Yes!

4225
03:11:32,910 --> 03:11:33,390
Yes!

4226
03:11:35,310 --> 03:11:35,790
Yes!

4227
03:11:37,630 --> 03:11:39,010
That was so close.

4228
03:11:42,030 --> 03:11:42,870
Oh my gosh.

4229
03:11:43,410 --> 03:11:44,050
Okay, good.

4230
03:11:44,150 --> 03:11:45,510
Now if we explode...

4231
03:11:45,510 --> 03:11:47,530
Well, at least... And we can get more...

4232
03:11:47,530 --> 03:11:49,170
Oh wait, let me grab more...

4233
03:11:51,450 --> 03:11:54,150
Let me grab more torpedoes!

4234
03:11:54,270 --> 03:11:55,450
Let me grab more torpedoes!

4235
03:11:58,090 --> 03:11:58,530
And...

4236
03:11:59,010 --> 03:11:59,450
Pee.

4237
03:12:01,850 --> 03:12:03,130
That's how you save in the game.

4238
03:12:03,230 --> 03:12:04,130
As you go and pee.

4239
03:12:05,770 --> 03:12:07,910
And yeah, I also destroyed this bathroom.

4240
03:12:08,910 --> 03:12:10,130
Don't even worry about it.

4241
03:12:12,150 --> 03:12:13,710
Don't even worry about it.

4242
03:12:13,730 --> 03:12:15,450
You can punch everything in this game.

4243
03:12:16,530 --> 03:12:19,090
You can punch everything in this game.

4244
03:12:20,630 --> 03:12:21,630
Did you wash your hands?

4245
03:12:21,890 --> 03:12:22,830
We're in the water.

4246
03:12:22,890 --> 03:12:24,010
I don't need to wash my hands.

4247
03:12:24,490 --> 03:12:26,150
We're literally swimming around.

4248
03:12:27,350 --> 03:12:28,730
We're in nature's sink.

4249
03:12:29,910 --> 03:12:30,970
And nature's toilet.

4250
03:12:31,070 --> 03:12:31,650
All in one.

4251
03:12:41,310 --> 03:12:41,890
Reset health?

4252
03:12:42,170 --> 03:12:43,010
Oh, like immediately?

4253
03:12:44,490 --> 03:12:45,410
Uh, it's okay.

4254
03:12:45,510 --> 03:12:46,450
Let's see if I can do it.

4255
03:12:46,630 --> 03:12:49,210
I know it's probably stupid, but you know.

4256
03:12:49,490 --> 03:12:51,870
We might have... I might be a gamer.

4257
03:12:51,970 --> 03:12:52,230
Okay.

4258
03:12:54,270 --> 03:12:54,770
Oops.

4259
03:12:55,030 --> 03:12:55,530
Oops.

4260
03:13:15,100 --> 03:13:16,800
That wasn't even intentional.

4261
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:19,300
I don't... I don't even...

4262
03:13:19,300 --> 03:13:21,480
I don't care what you guys think.

4263
03:13:21,580 --> 03:13:22,620
That was not intentional.

4264
03:13:23,100 --> 03:13:25,340
I think I just was going a little too fast.

4265
03:13:35,680 --> 03:13:36,160
Okay.

4266
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:37,940
I'll take it...

4267
03:13:37,940 --> 03:13:42,480
I'll take... around some of these corners I gotta go slow and steady.

4268
03:13:44,220 --> 03:13:52,080
No matter how good I think I am, physics decides that it has other plans for me.

4269
03:13:54,200 --> 03:13:55,060
Like here.

4270
03:13:55,280 --> 03:13:56,360
This one is tricky.

4271
03:13:56,580 --> 03:13:57,060
Oh my gosh!

4272
03:13:57,160 --> 03:13:58,200
I pressed the wrong button!

4273
03:14:01,360 --> 03:14:01,980
It's okay.

4274
03:14:02,120 --> 03:14:03,340
We only lost a little bit.

4275
03:14:03,920 --> 03:14:05,500
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

4276
03:14:05,960 --> 03:14:07,740
Never mind, I'm going this way instead!

4277
03:14:21,910 --> 03:14:22,410
Oh.

4278
03:14:26,890 --> 03:14:28,950
What is this?

4279
03:14:30,170 --> 03:14:30,670
Hugo?

4280
03:14:33,890 --> 03:14:34,610
Oh my god.

4281
03:14:34,610 --> 03:14:34,970
Ah!

4282
03:14:56,400 --> 03:14:57,560
You had to feel lonely.

4283
03:14:58,020 --> 03:14:58,900
Locked in that submarine.

4284
03:14:59,320 --> 03:15:00,140
Eh, it's in company.

4285
03:15:01,760 --> 03:15:02,900
I'm trying to get the medal.

4286
03:15:03,900 --> 03:15:04,500
Oh my gosh.

4287
03:15:04,580 --> 03:15:04,760
Wait.

4288
03:15:06,580 --> 03:15:07,920
I locked in too fast.

4289
03:15:08,040 --> 03:15:08,440
Okay, hold on.

4290
03:15:09,020 --> 03:15:09,580
Oh my god.

4291
03:15:12,840 --> 03:15:13,560
Unagi blast!

4292
03:15:15,180 --> 03:15:15,800
Oh, okay.

4293
03:15:15,840 --> 03:15:16,740
He comes out of each hole.

4294
03:15:18,660 --> 03:15:20,080
Oh, it's a...

4295
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:21,920
Don't bite me.

4296
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:38,640
Yeah.

4297
03:15:38,800 --> 03:15:39,940
Get out of here, Hugo.

4298
03:15:40,600 --> 03:15:41,700
Boss defeated.

4299
03:15:42,040 --> 03:15:43,040
Boss defeated.

4300
03:15:45,840 --> 03:15:47,060
Boss defeated.

4301
03:15:47,540 --> 03:15:47,940
No!

4302
03:15:49,660 --> 03:15:50,600
Medical expert.

4303
03:15:50,660 --> 03:15:51,480
You can hold more than...

4304
03:15:51,480 --> 03:15:53,580
Four more maximum healing kits.

4305
03:15:54,400 --> 03:15:55,340
Gag reflex.

4306
03:15:55,740 --> 03:15:58,520
You sedate guards twice as fast and drag them faster.

4307
03:15:59,520 --> 03:15:59,960
Mentos.

4308
03:16:00,340 --> 03:16:01,840
Don't abide by laws of physics.

4309
03:16:01,860 --> 03:16:03,080
It's the rules of nature.

4310
03:16:04,880 --> 03:16:05,760
Boss defeated.

4311
03:16:09,140 --> 03:16:11,020
I think the gag reflex is alright.

4312
03:16:11,840 --> 03:16:13,660
But then I can hold more healing kits.

4313
03:16:20,030 --> 03:16:21,690
Gag reflex seems good for your playstyle.

4314
03:16:21,790 --> 03:16:22,210
I agree.

4315
03:16:25,110 --> 03:16:26,050
What's this down here?

4316
03:16:26,170 --> 03:16:27,010
More missiles?

4317
03:16:28,490 --> 03:16:29,110
I'm guessing.

4318
03:16:30,890 --> 03:16:32,230
Do I just go through the hole?

4319
03:16:34,050 --> 03:16:34,750
Easy now.

4320
03:16:35,090 --> 03:16:35,570
Easy.

4321
03:16:36,490 --> 03:16:37,270
Easy now.

4322
03:16:37,650 --> 03:16:39,410
Oh, the light!

4323
03:16:39,710 --> 03:16:40,890
At the end of the title!

4324
03:16:45,690 --> 03:16:46,490
I'm free!

4325
03:16:48,210 --> 03:16:48,690
Wow!

4326
03:16:48,930 --> 03:16:50,250
That stage wasn't very long at all.

4327
03:16:51,670 --> 03:16:53,050
There was a second secret.

4328
03:16:53,510 --> 03:16:54,270
I missed it.

4329
03:16:58,940 --> 03:16:59,980
What were the other holes?

4330
03:17:00,200 --> 03:17:00,240
Oh.

4331
03:17:02,220 --> 03:17:03,500
They might have been the secret.

4332
03:17:05,360 --> 03:17:07,380
For some reason I just assumed they were all the same.

4333
03:17:08,020 --> 03:17:09,180
The boom docks.

4334
03:17:09,820 --> 03:17:12,040
I ended up in what looked like a dock.

4335
03:17:13,260 --> 03:17:15,320
There were containers and stuff.

4336
03:17:16,260 --> 03:17:18,200
The sea was slightly rough.

4337
03:17:18,580 --> 03:17:18,720
Oh.

4338
03:17:19,860 --> 03:17:21,560
Oh, and there was a storm.

4339
03:17:21,740 --> 03:17:22,660
That's why the sea is...

4340
03:17:22,660 --> 03:17:24,900
Oh my gosh.

4341
03:17:24,960 --> 03:17:25,740
Just like yesterday.

4342
03:17:26,840 --> 03:17:28,280
I was in Akiba yesterday.

4343
03:17:28,620 --> 03:17:30,060
And it was like... it was...

4344
03:17:30,240 --> 03:17:30,660
Thunder.

4345
03:17:30,720 --> 03:17:32,280
Like, it was crazy storm.

4346
03:17:32,540 --> 03:17:33,080
Oh!

4347
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:33,720
Okay.

4348
03:17:35,820 --> 03:17:38,340
I got a potty!

4349
03:17:39,280 --> 03:17:40,720
I got money!

4350
03:17:41,200 --> 03:17:42,980
Ten million dollars!

4351
03:17:45,860 --> 03:17:46,320
Wait!

4352
03:17:48,100 --> 03:17:50,240
I just got...

4353
03:17:52,080 --> 03:17:53,000
Huh?

4354
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:53,640
Huh?

4355
03:17:57,780 --> 03:17:58,460
Let's go!

4356
03:17:59,080 --> 03:17:59,640
Baby!

4357
03:18:01,120 --> 03:18:05,900
Under the rain and the biting cold, the colonel's fate gnawed at my mind.

4358
03:18:05,900 --> 03:18:08,580
According to Robert, they were moving him.

4359
03:18:08,980 --> 03:18:10,480
Was it a routine inspection?

4360
03:18:10,980 --> 03:18:12,640
Would he be returned to his cell?

4361
03:18:12,780 --> 03:18:14,500
Would they find the radio?

4362
03:18:14,740 --> 03:18:17,860
He was an old, annoying, tiresome man.

4363
03:18:18,160 --> 03:18:19,840
But I feared for his life.

4364
03:18:20,100 --> 03:18:21,700
Until the radio chimed in.

4365
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:23,600
Channel One.

4366
03:18:24,860 --> 03:18:26,580
Colonel, what happened?

4367
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:27,640
Are you okay?

4368
03:18:27,980 --> 03:18:28,940
I'm fine.

4369
03:18:29,600 --> 03:18:31,100
Mr. Fox, thank you for asking.

4370
03:18:31,280 --> 03:18:34,020
But my rank is general, not colonel.

4371
03:18:34,180 --> 03:18:35,860
Wait, you're...

4372
03:18:35,860 --> 03:18:37,220
General X?

4373
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:40,140
So, Mr. Fox, have you heard?

4374
03:18:40,360 --> 03:18:42,080
You've become quite the celebrity.

4375
03:18:42,420 --> 03:18:44,940
I've been dying to meet you since your debut.

4376
03:18:45,220 --> 03:18:45,740
How'd you get my number?

4377
03:18:45,740 --> 03:18:50,300
So I took this hack job of a radio to call you before your inevitable capture.

4378
03:18:50,940 --> 03:18:52,380
Where's the colonel?

4379
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,200
Don't worry about him.

4380
03:18:54,360 --> 03:18:55,480
He's in good hands.

4381
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:56,880
Say hello, colonel.

4382
03:18:57,060 --> 03:18:58,560
Fox, run away!

4383
03:18:59,020 --> 03:19:00,320
Don't listen to this bastard!

4384
03:19:00,600 --> 03:19:02,620
Get your hands off me, you fucking moron!

4385
03:19:03,920 --> 03:19:06,080
Seniors say such silly things.

4386
03:19:06,200 --> 03:19:08,700
I join him in wishing you a happy escape.

4387
03:19:08,980 --> 03:19:10,300
But you know too much.

4388
03:19:10,560 --> 03:19:12,600
Sooner or later, you will make a mistake.

4389
03:19:12,900 --> 03:19:15,080
One that'll prove fatal.

4390
03:19:15,580 --> 03:19:17,200
We'll see about that.

4391
03:19:17,820 --> 03:19:18,380
General.

4392
03:19:18,900 --> 03:19:19,360
General.

4393
03:19:19,360 --> 03:19:19,480
Roll.

4394
03:19:20,980 --> 03:19:21,500
Wow.

4395
03:19:21,500 --> 03:19:23,240
What about our friend, Line 2?

4396
03:19:23,460 --> 03:19:23,680
Jesse here.

4397
03:19:23,940 --> 03:19:24,680
Do you copy?

4398
03:19:24,980 --> 03:19:25,840
I hear you.

4399
03:19:26,180 --> 03:19:26,700
Nope.

4400
03:19:26,780 --> 03:19:27,700
He's still there.

4401
03:19:27,920 --> 03:19:28,720
Jesse here.

4402
03:19:28,920 --> 03:19:29,260
Over.

4403
03:19:30,020 --> 03:19:32,080
No one else wants to talk to me.

4404
03:19:32,800 --> 03:19:33,780
It's quite lonely.

4405
03:19:34,760 --> 03:19:35,720
Where is everybody?

4406
03:19:36,560 --> 03:19:37,340
I'm nervous.

4407
03:19:38,820 --> 03:19:39,840
Oh my god!

4408
03:19:41,720 --> 03:19:43,020
That's where everybody is!

4409
03:19:45,080 --> 03:19:46,100
Actually, you know what?

4410
03:19:46,200 --> 03:19:47,160
Let's just redo that.

4411
03:19:49,400 --> 03:19:50,840
Yeah, just kill me, actually.

4412
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:51,760
If you don't mind.

4413
03:19:51,940 --> 03:19:53,140
Because I don't want to use my health.

4414
03:19:54,880 --> 03:19:55,320
Wait.

4415
03:19:55,420 --> 03:19:57,080
What can I draw with my blood?

4416
03:19:58,000 --> 03:19:58,620
There we go.

4417
03:20:02,820 --> 03:20:04,700
Some things require tight timing.

4418
03:20:08,180 --> 03:20:08,620
Okay.

4419
03:20:08,740 --> 03:20:09,580
We can skip this.

4420
03:20:10,220 --> 03:20:10,800
Oh, wait.

4421
03:20:12,020 --> 03:20:13,120
Let's also get our money.

4422
03:20:13,760 --> 03:20:14,760
And our potty.

4423
03:20:19,020 --> 03:20:19,960
A maid cafe.

4424
03:20:23,060 --> 03:20:23,500
Wait.

4425
03:20:24,320 --> 03:20:26,260
Only storks and dorks go to maid cafes.

4426
03:20:26,400 --> 03:20:27,400
Private storks?

4427
03:20:28,580 --> 03:20:30,640
You don't look much like a stork to me.

4428
03:20:30,700 --> 03:20:32,520
So that kind of narrows it down.

4429
03:20:34,080 --> 03:20:36,020
Oh my gosh.

4430
03:20:36,080 --> 03:20:36,480
Here they come.

4431
03:20:46,600 --> 03:20:47,640
This seems too easy.

4432
03:20:49,160 --> 03:20:50,060
Oh, excuse me.

4433
03:20:50,600 --> 03:20:52,340
Trying to use the water closet.

4434
03:21:02,610 --> 03:21:04,290
What if I am a stork, huh?

4435
03:21:05,630 --> 03:21:06,590
That's how I was done.

4436
03:21:06,610 --> 03:21:07,130
Delivered.

4437
03:21:08,250 --> 03:21:09,130
Nothing interesting.

4438
03:21:09,730 --> 03:21:10,850
Nothing, yeah.

4439
03:21:11,210 --> 03:21:12,690
More money!

4440
03:21:13,030 --> 03:21:13,590
What?

4441
03:21:16,510 --> 03:21:16,990
Wait.

4442
03:21:17,110 --> 03:21:19,050
Now we have 20 million dollars!

4443
03:21:20,770 --> 03:21:22,050
Nothing interesting.

4444
03:21:22,050 --> 03:21:22,490
Who are we?

4445
03:21:22,890 --> 03:21:26,390
Nothing interesting.

4446
03:21:38,410 --> 03:21:39,850
Nothing interesting.

4447
03:21:40,470 --> 03:21:40,730
Okay.

4448
03:21:41,570 --> 03:21:43,030
Nothing interesting.

4449
03:21:44,990 --> 03:21:45,430
Okay.

4450
03:21:45,530 --> 03:21:46,470
I'm gonna have to dodge these.

4451
03:21:46,590 --> 03:21:48,550
Or roll through these, you know?

4452
03:21:49,650 --> 03:21:51,350
Are they gonna come from both sides?

4453
03:21:51,430 --> 03:21:51,810
Probably.

4454
03:21:53,930 --> 03:21:54,550
I'm scared.

4455
03:21:56,930 --> 03:21:57,630
Where are they?

4456
03:22:00,550 --> 03:22:01,430
More money!

4457
03:22:02,950 --> 03:22:04,550
This is getting ridiculous, you guys.

4458
03:22:08,540 --> 03:22:09,420
You assholes!

4459
03:22:14,380 --> 03:22:16,080
Oh, I guess I could've just bandaged that.

4460
03:22:16,540 --> 03:22:17,140
You know what?

4461
03:22:17,260 --> 03:22:19,200
I should've just bandaged it.

4462
03:22:19,360 --> 03:22:20,080
It's fine, though.

4463
03:22:40,660 --> 03:22:41,420
Nothing useful.

4464
03:22:41,500 --> 03:22:42,320
Oh, um...

4465
03:22:46,480 --> 03:22:47,240
Nothing useful.

4466
03:22:50,300 --> 03:22:50,680
Anyway.

4467
03:22:51,060 --> 03:22:52,200
What else is in here?

4468
03:22:53,140 --> 03:22:53,660
Anyway.

4469
03:22:55,840 --> 03:22:56,860
What else is here?

4470
03:22:57,280 --> 03:22:58,140
Useless stuff.

4471
03:22:58,260 --> 03:22:59,000
Useless stuff.

4472
03:23:00,220 --> 03:23:01,260
Nothing useful.

4473
03:23:02,960 --> 03:23:03,480
Okay.

4474
03:23:05,600 --> 03:23:06,840
Keep their asses quick.

4475
03:23:07,160 --> 03:23:08,340
That's what you gotta do.

4476
03:23:08,660 --> 03:23:10,100
That's what you gotta do, man.

4477
03:23:15,300 --> 03:23:16,880
I think I'll have to chloroform.

4478
03:23:17,060 --> 03:23:17,480
Well...

4479
03:23:18,560 --> 03:23:20,760
I think I just have to kick both of their butts.

4480
03:23:21,240 --> 03:23:21,760
What?

4481
03:23:21,760 --> 03:23:24,100
You guys were walking in tandem, and then what happened?

4482
03:23:24,840 --> 03:23:27,300
You guys were walking in tandem, and then what happened?

4483
03:23:27,300 --> 03:23:27,580
Purple box?

4484
03:23:29,280 --> 03:23:29,940
This one?

4485
03:23:30,080 --> 03:23:31,120
Did I not open this one?

4486
03:23:31,280 --> 03:23:32,040
I did, right?

4487
03:23:32,920 --> 03:23:33,800
Useless stuff.

4488
03:23:42,640 --> 03:23:43,200
Um...

4489
03:23:44,460 --> 03:23:45,720
We are on...

4490
03:23:45,720 --> 03:23:48,560
We got the chloroform, so...

4491
03:23:48,560 --> 03:23:48,680
We got the chloroform, so...

4492
03:23:50,300 --> 03:23:53,100
Let's just have this on the ready.

4493
03:23:53,480 --> 03:23:53,620
Let's just have this on the ready.

4494
03:23:58,740 --> 03:23:59,300
Hmm...

4495
03:23:59,300 --> 03:24:00,360
Hmm...

4496
03:24:01,020 --> 03:24:02,720
Hmm... How do I want to do this?

4497
03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:03,440
Hmm...

4498
03:24:04,160 --> 03:24:04,720
No!

4499
03:24:04,840 --> 03:24:05,480
Don't walk away!

4500
03:24:08,400 --> 03:24:09,200
I don't...

4501
03:24:10,620 --> 03:24:12,320
I don't want to...

4502
03:24:15,260 --> 03:24:16,700
I don't want to...

4503
03:24:16,700 --> 03:24:18,280
I don't want to alert them, because I want the...

4504
03:24:18,280 --> 03:24:18,960
XP.

4505
03:24:22,080 --> 03:24:24,940
Like that.

4506
03:24:26,260 --> 03:24:26,820
Hey!

4507
03:24:28,120 --> 03:24:28,680
Hey!

4508
03:24:28,680 --> 03:24:29,060
Hey!

4509
03:24:32,300 --> 03:24:34,860
Oh, a coin would be good for this, wouldn't it?

4510
03:24:35,740 --> 03:24:37,340
But I think we can still get him.

4511
03:24:37,440 --> 03:24:38,140
But I think we can still get him.

4512
03:24:38,300 --> 03:24:40,940
That's what the gag reflex did, baby.

4513
03:24:42,600 --> 03:24:43,620
It made him...

4514
03:24:43,620 --> 03:24:45,820
Oh my gosh, they go out so fast!

4515
03:24:47,840 --> 03:24:48,740
Useless stuff.

4516
03:24:49,760 --> 03:24:52,360
And I can drag them away so fast!

4517
03:24:53,660 --> 03:24:54,780
Hell yeah!

4518
03:24:55,600 --> 03:24:56,160
Money!

4519
03:24:56,160 --> 03:24:56,340
Money!

4520
03:24:57,720 --> 03:24:58,700
More money!

4521
03:25:06,320 --> 03:25:06,840
Hmm...

4522
03:25:10,380 --> 03:25:11,520
40 mil, baby!

4523
03:25:11,980 --> 03:25:12,040
40 mil, baby!

4524
03:25:12,480 --> 03:25:15,420
I'm scared of walking along down here because of the guy.

4525
03:25:15,700 --> 03:25:15,880
I'm scared of walking along down here because of the guy.

4526
03:25:15,880 --> 03:25:16,020
Oh!

4527
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:18,360
Oh, he's probably...

4528
03:25:19,240 --> 03:25:21,540
He probably wants me to give him money.

4529
03:25:22,220 --> 03:25:23,500
To get him...

4530
03:25:23,500 --> 03:25:26,300
To take me on the ship, right?

4531
03:25:27,100 --> 03:25:28,280
To get him... To take me on the ship, right?

4532
03:25:28,340 --> 03:25:29,640
She's a lovely ship!

4533
03:25:29,880 --> 03:25:30,400
Indeed!

4534
03:25:31,480 --> 03:25:34,100
And flies like the wind or the waves.

4535
03:25:34,120 --> 03:25:35,060
And flies like the wind or the waves.

4536
03:25:35,080 --> 03:25:35,580
Is she yours?

4537
03:25:36,080 --> 03:25:36,760
She is!

4538
03:25:36,760 --> 03:25:37,260
I cut my finger.

4539
03:25:37,320 --> 03:25:38,700
Can you kiss it and make it feel better?

4540
03:25:39,080 --> 03:25:39,660
I cut my finger.

4541
03:25:40,100 --> 03:25:40,620
Can you kiss it and make it feel better?

4542
03:25:43,140 --> 03:25:45,160
This beauty costs...

4543
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:46,980
Fifty million dollars!

4544
03:25:47,620 --> 03:25:49,420
I doubt you can afford it.

4545
03:25:49,640 --> 03:25:50,940
Just fifty million.

4546
03:25:52,460 --> 03:25:53,420
I've got...

4547
03:25:53,420 --> 03:25:55,480
I'm a few dollars short.

4548
03:25:55,800 --> 03:25:56,440
Actually... Hold on.

4549
03:25:56,600 --> 03:25:57,760
I'm going to the ATM.

4550
03:25:59,700 --> 03:26:00,220
Actually... Hold on.

4551
03:26:00,220 --> 03:26:01,460
I'm going to the ATM.

4552
03:26:01,460 --> 03:26:01,600
I don't have money.

4553
03:26:02,100 --> 03:26:03,840
So I searched in the containers.

4554
03:26:04,300 --> 03:26:05,360
Why in the containers?

4555
03:26:05,700 --> 03:26:06,260
I don't know.

4556
03:26:06,380 --> 03:26:08,140
It's how people usually smuggle money.

4557
03:26:08,680 --> 03:26:09,280
Thank you.

4558
03:26:09,300 --> 03:26:09,700
You're welcome.

4559
03:26:10,540 --> 03:26:11,960
Buy the SS...

4560
03:26:12,820 --> 03:26:13,220
Velas.

4561
03:26:14,180 --> 03:26:16,600
For fifty million dollars.

4562
03:26:17,300 --> 03:26:18,380
What if the rest of...

4563
03:26:18,380 --> 03:26:20,480
What if the last... Well, we're already at forty million.

4564
03:26:20,540 --> 03:26:21,440
We just need ten more.

4565
03:26:21,740 --> 03:26:24,180
What if the last bit is in that one down there though, you know?

4566
03:26:25,640 --> 03:26:26,040
Hmm...

4567
03:26:28,080 --> 03:26:29,280
We're not smuggling money.

4568
03:26:29,280 --> 03:26:30,880
We're doing very legal activities.

4569
03:26:31,180 --> 03:26:31,380
Okay?

4570
03:26:43,760 --> 03:26:44,700
Nothing useful.

4571
03:26:45,080 --> 03:26:45,560
Nothing.

4572
03:26:45,680 --> 03:26:45,980
Yeah.

4573
03:26:48,140 --> 03:26:48,620
Oh!

4574
03:26:48,960 --> 03:26:49,740
That's useful.

4575
03:26:50,420 --> 03:26:51,060
Thank you.

4576
03:26:51,320 --> 03:26:52,140
Nothing interesting.

4577
03:26:52,280 --> 03:26:52,640
Wait!

4578
03:26:52,820 --> 03:26:54,700
But there's nothing else...

4579
03:26:56,340 --> 03:26:57,440
Blue crate at the beginning?

4580
03:26:57,680 --> 03:26:58,420
No, I got it.

4581
03:27:02,800 --> 03:27:03,280
Hmm...

4582
03:27:04,340 --> 03:27:06,940
Did you get the first box you used as cover against the boat?

4583
03:27:08,940 --> 03:27:10,240
The one near the save point.

4584
03:27:18,740 --> 03:27:19,680
The one over here?

4585
03:27:21,500 --> 03:27:23,800
I don't think I missed them at the beginning, did I not?

4586
03:27:23,880 --> 03:27:24,940
I thought I got all of them.

4587
03:27:25,980 --> 03:27:27,620
The blue crate after the beginning.

4588
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:28,840
Nothing interesting.

4589
03:27:30,980 --> 03:27:32,260
I thought I got it though.

4590
03:27:35,820 --> 03:27:36,920
This one, you mean?

4591
03:27:37,340 --> 03:27:38,020
Oh my gosh.

4592
03:27:38,200 --> 03:27:39,340
I did get this one.

4593
03:27:41,640 --> 03:27:42,440
Nothing useful.

4594
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:44,480
See?

4595
03:27:45,940 --> 03:27:46,760
So I got that one.

4596
03:27:47,360 --> 03:27:48,140
Next over.

4597
03:27:48,380 --> 03:27:48,520
Okay.

4598
03:27:50,140 --> 03:27:50,700
This one.

4599
03:27:52,500 --> 03:27:53,280
Boat money fund.

4600
03:27:53,460 --> 03:27:54,020
Oh, thank you.

4601
03:27:55,020 --> 03:27:55,940
I'm gonna... yeah.

4602
03:27:56,100 --> 03:27:57,360
I'm gonna start my GoFundMe.

4603
03:27:58,740 --> 03:27:59,540
Oh gosh!

4604
03:27:59,780 --> 03:28:00,860
You assholes!

4605
03:28:06,400 --> 03:28:08,400
I think I'm gonna have to just sit here and heal.

4606
03:28:10,700 --> 03:28:12,240
Well, I definitely did not get that one.

4607
03:28:12,300 --> 03:28:12,840
So thanks guys.

4608
03:28:13,080 --> 03:28:13,540
Oh, wait.

4609
03:28:14,600 --> 03:28:16,120
Actually, once I'm healed up...

4610
03:28:16,120 --> 03:28:17,560
This would be a good place to save.

4611
03:28:19,300 --> 03:28:20,040
Let's heal up.

4612
03:28:20,260 --> 03:28:21,800
Let's take a little breaky break.

4613
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:24,260
Once we save...

4614
03:28:25,400 --> 03:28:26,700
Once we're all healed, we'll save.

4615
03:28:26,960 --> 03:28:27,860
And then...

4616
03:28:27,860 --> 03:28:29,760
We will buy ourselves a bow!

4617
03:28:32,820 --> 03:28:34,660
Because we've got 50 million dollars.

4618
03:28:34,700 --> 03:28:35,240
Easy peasy.

4619
03:28:36,700 --> 03:28:38,640
Make sure you wash your hands before you piss.

4620
03:28:39,080 --> 03:28:40,740
I broke the sink, sir.

4621
03:28:40,860 --> 03:28:41,700
What do I do now, sir?

4622
03:28:43,980 --> 03:28:45,560
The spot between the boxes.

4623
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:48,220
What, this one?

4624
03:28:52,040 --> 03:28:52,780
What, this one?

4625
03:28:54,180 --> 03:28:55,080
Oh my gosh!

4626
03:29:06,940 --> 03:29:07,980
There's nothing in here.

4627
03:29:37,560 --> 03:29:38,860
Go to the other side.

4628
03:29:38,960 --> 03:29:39,600
Double secret.

4629
03:29:40,540 --> 03:29:41,920
Double secret, double secret.

4630
03:29:47,750 --> 03:29:49,070
Wait, how do I get to the other side?

4631
03:29:51,090 --> 03:29:51,910
Maybe I...

4632
03:29:51,910 --> 03:29:57,210
Is there a way to punch the wall?

4633
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:04,680
Is there a way to punch the wall?

4634
03:30:04,680 --> 03:30:06,660
That stairs is like over here.

4635
03:30:13,340 --> 03:30:14,220
Grenade the wall?

4636
03:30:15,200 --> 03:30:16,100
Like downstairs?

4637
03:30:28,780 --> 03:30:29,900
Grenades are not required.

4638
03:30:30,160 --> 03:30:30,660
Oh, thank you.

4639
03:30:30,660 --> 03:30:30,780
Yeah.

4640
03:30:33,340 --> 03:30:35,280
That so says the dev, everybody.

4641
03:30:36,480 --> 03:30:38,920
Grenades are not required in this part.

4642
03:30:52,420 --> 03:30:54,440
And I lied, but not this time.

4643
03:31:28,140 --> 03:31:30,060
A box to the right outside.

4644
03:31:30,240 --> 03:31:31,060
That's what I tried, though.

4645
03:31:32,140 --> 03:31:33,300
Unless it's like this one.

4646
03:31:45,570 --> 03:31:46,610
More stamina!

4647
03:31:48,750 --> 03:31:49,550
All right.

4648
03:31:52,510 --> 03:31:54,470
Yeah, it was further over than I thought it would be, too.

4649
03:31:56,290 --> 03:31:56,910
Very nice.

4650
03:31:57,050 --> 03:31:57,930
And we're all healed up.

4651
03:31:59,730 --> 03:32:00,430
Good job.

4652
03:32:01,730 --> 03:32:02,670
Good job, everybody.

4653
03:32:06,750 --> 03:32:07,150
Okay.

4654
03:32:08,270 --> 03:32:09,210
Let's go buy a boat.

4655
03:32:10,510 --> 03:32:12,170
And not get hit by another boat.

4656
03:32:12,450 --> 03:32:13,810
I shoot so fast, you guys.

4657
03:32:15,990 --> 03:32:17,290
I shoot so fast.

4658
03:32:28,420 --> 03:32:29,040
Oh, my gosh.

4659
03:32:29,160 --> 03:32:30,320
We made it.

4660
03:32:30,400 --> 03:32:30,540
Okay.

4661
03:32:33,600 --> 03:32:33,980
Perfect.

4662
03:32:34,980 --> 03:32:35,640
Hello, sir.

4663
03:32:35,660 --> 03:32:38,860
I have $50 million.

4664
03:32:40,960 --> 03:32:41,660
Yes, sir.

4665
03:32:44,080 --> 03:32:44,780
Thank you, sir.

4666
03:32:46,080 --> 03:32:47,140
Thanks, Mr. Krabs.

4667
03:32:48,360 --> 03:32:48,740
Yippee!

4668
03:32:49,060 --> 03:32:49,160
Yay!

4669
03:32:50,300 --> 03:32:50,680
Um.

4670
03:32:50,860 --> 03:32:54,160
And that's how I bought the ship I would finally escape in.

4671
03:33:00,060 --> 03:33:02,740
If only a lightning bolt didn't split her in two.

4672
03:33:15,980 --> 03:33:17,200
Beat him up!

4673
03:33:17,460 --> 03:33:18,500
Kick his ass!

4674
03:33:19,480 --> 03:33:21,120
Kick his ass, Jesse Fox!

4675
03:33:22,860 --> 03:33:24,640
About 50 million.

4676
03:33:28,390 --> 03:33:29,700
We got scammed, everybody.

4677
03:33:31,400 --> 03:33:35,960
I was gonna say it's probably here, but I just realized...

4678
03:33:36,680 --> 03:33:37,440
Oh no!

4679
03:33:37,560 --> 03:33:38,360
This guy.

4680
03:33:41,440 --> 03:33:43,960
Why can't I... There we go.

4681
03:33:45,410 --> 03:33:47,040
I didn't need it anyway.

4682
03:33:50,180 --> 03:33:51,520
There we go!

4683
03:33:53,940 --> 03:33:55,700
That scared the heck out of me.

4684
03:33:55,880 --> 03:33:56,660
Useless stuff.

4685
03:33:58,640 --> 03:34:00,220
Why are you guys so violent?

4686
03:34:00,500 --> 03:34:02,240
What if I was an actual employee?

4687
03:34:03,440 --> 03:34:04,900
What if I was on your team?

4688
03:34:09,960 --> 03:34:12,460
They knew exactly I was here.

4689
03:34:19,040 --> 03:34:20,500
That was so close.

4690
03:34:20,720 --> 03:34:22,640
Useless stuff.

4691
03:34:22,640 --> 03:34:23,020
Oh!

4692
03:34:24,920 --> 03:34:25,340
Bathroom.

4693
03:34:32,440 --> 03:34:32,860
Yes!

4694
03:34:33,660 --> 03:34:34,420
Occupational hazard.

4695
03:34:34,840 --> 03:34:37,640
You just gotta be ready for it if you work in these places, right?

4696
03:34:41,510 --> 03:34:43,250
It's just one of those things, you know?

4697
03:34:47,970 --> 03:34:48,390
Ashes!

4698
03:34:50,670 --> 03:34:54,190
It's late in my part of the states, but I wanted to say hi and I care you, Mintel.

4699
03:34:54,410 --> 03:34:54,710
Thanks!

4700
03:34:55,210 --> 03:34:56,750
I know it's pretty late for...

4701
03:34:56,750 --> 03:34:57,870
I got more money!

4702
03:34:57,870 --> 03:35:00,830
It's pretty late for when I usually stream, you know?

4703
03:35:03,270 --> 03:35:04,690
So I'm so sorry, you guys.

4704
03:35:05,250 --> 03:35:06,090
That it's been...

4705
03:35:06,090 --> 03:35:08,910
That I've been having to stream so much later than my usual times.

4706
03:35:09,590 --> 03:35:10,390
Nothing interesting.

4707
03:35:11,190 --> 03:35:13,970
I like how you guys say it's a red crate, but it looks purple to me.

4708
03:35:16,050 --> 03:35:17,070
Is that not purple?

4709
03:35:17,730 --> 03:35:18,530
Nothing useful.

4710
03:35:22,090 --> 03:35:22,490
Yippee!

4711
03:35:22,490 --> 03:35:22,670
Yippee!

4712
03:35:44,740 --> 03:35:46,460
I wonder if I can shoot them.

4713
03:35:47,900 --> 03:35:49,360
I wonder if I can shoot them down.

4714
03:35:50,680 --> 03:35:51,600
Nothing interesting.

4715
03:35:53,880 --> 03:35:54,340
OMG,

4716
03:35:57,720 --> 03:35:58,200
she rolled.

4717
03:35:58,380 --> 03:35:59,600
I've been rolling this whole stream!

4718
03:36:00,060 --> 03:36:01,140
What are you talking about?

4719
03:36:03,300 --> 03:36:03,820
What the?

4720
03:36:04,180 --> 03:36:05,180
What is this boss music?

4721
03:36:05,820 --> 03:36:06,280
Ah!

4722
03:36:06,760 --> 03:36:07,900
Oh my god.

4723
03:36:08,120 --> 03:36:11,400
Are you telling me that a nuclear submarine attacked you?

4724
03:36:11,640 --> 03:36:12,840
That's what I'm saying.

4725
03:36:13,100 --> 03:36:13,860
I see.

4726
03:36:13,960 --> 03:36:17,240
And now you're going to tell me you fought it instead of running away.

4727
03:36:17,560 --> 03:36:17,680
Wait!

4728
03:36:17,680 --> 03:36:17,840
Wait!

4729
03:36:17,980 --> 03:36:18,460
Of course.

4730
03:36:18,640 --> 03:36:21,480
I would have left it alone if it didn't launch its missiles.

4731
03:36:21,880 --> 03:36:25,840
And nobody launches missiles at me without permission.

4732
03:36:28,400 --> 03:36:30,460
Jesse Fox versus the nuclear sub!

4733
03:36:31,580 --> 03:36:32,100
Um...

4734
03:36:39,930 --> 03:36:40,530
Oh, okay.

4735
03:36:40,610 --> 03:36:41,730
So I grenade it, I'm guessing.

4736
03:36:41,990 --> 03:36:43,230
That's why they're giving that to me.

4737
03:36:47,390 --> 03:36:48,130
Oh my gosh.

4738
03:36:48,290 --> 03:36:49,270
Oh, I can't touch.

4739
03:36:49,990 --> 03:36:50,790
Oh, no.

4740
03:36:52,070 --> 03:36:53,270
Oh, this is...

4741
03:36:54,610 --> 03:36:55,230
Not good.

4742
03:36:56,450 --> 03:36:56,850
Oh.

4743
03:36:58,430 --> 03:36:59,010
He's dead.

4744
03:36:59,150 --> 03:36:59,690
I'm done-zo.

4745
03:37:07,690 --> 03:37:08,610
Into the tubes?

4746
03:37:08,690 --> 03:37:08,830
Yeah.

4747
03:37:08,910 --> 03:37:09,230
That's what I'm talking about.

4748
03:37:09,230 --> 03:37:10,010
That's what I was thinking too.

4749
03:37:11,490 --> 03:37:14,430
Okay, I don't think there was anything in these that like...

4750
03:37:14,430 --> 03:37:15,110
Oh, there was the money.

4751
03:37:15,370 --> 03:37:16,790
There was money in one of them, right?

4752
03:37:18,270 --> 03:37:19,290
We'll take the money.

4753
03:37:19,450 --> 03:37:19,910
There it is.

4754
03:37:20,930 --> 03:37:22,270
We'll take the cash money.

4755
03:37:34,760 --> 03:37:37,700
This one, it reminds me kind of of like the...

4756
03:37:38,980 --> 03:37:40,220
Remember how I...

4757
03:37:40,220 --> 03:37:40,720
There was...

4758
03:37:40,720 --> 03:37:43,400
Much earlier, we watched the first playthrough.

4759
03:37:43,920 --> 03:37:45,040
There was a...

4760
03:37:45,040 --> 03:37:46,500
There was a...

4761
03:37:47,240 --> 03:37:48,220
Like a crate.

4762
03:37:48,860 --> 03:37:49,160
Thing.

4763
03:37:49,360 --> 03:37:50,240
And I just had to like...

4764
03:37:50,720 --> 03:37:53,040
Kind of go over slightly each time.

4765
03:37:53,720 --> 03:37:54,860
Sort of like that.

4766
03:37:57,260 --> 03:37:58,300
But just ruder.

4767
03:38:04,980 --> 03:38:05,660
Oh my gosh.

4768
03:38:05,740 --> 03:38:06,280
Beep, beep, beep!

4769
03:38:13,600 --> 03:38:16,080
Didn't I get an extra health somewhere too?

4770
03:38:16,480 --> 03:38:17,640
I thought I had six.

4771
03:38:20,540 --> 03:38:22,580
First aid kit in the purple container.

4772
03:38:22,820 --> 03:38:23,060
Okay.

4773
03:38:23,700 --> 03:38:24,180
And...

4774
03:38:26,800 --> 03:38:27,500
This one...

4775
03:38:27,640 --> 03:38:27,740
Over here?

4776
03:38:29,300 --> 03:38:29,820
Oh!

4777
03:38:29,820 --> 03:38:32,340
Come on.

4778
03:38:32,820 --> 03:38:33,780
Oh no.

4779
03:38:33,940 --> 03:38:34,840
I just wasted one.

4780
03:38:50,680 --> 03:38:51,800
Equivalent exchange.

4781
03:38:53,500 --> 03:38:54,440
All right.

4782
03:38:54,480 --> 03:38:56,360
Now this is...

4783
03:38:56,940 --> 03:38:57,500
Hmm.

4784
03:39:02,900 --> 03:39:03,660
Oh!

4785
03:39:03,680 --> 03:39:03,960
Ah!

4786
03:39:08,540 --> 03:39:09,940
I thought I had more time.

4787
03:39:10,100 --> 03:39:10,860
I'll be honest.

4788
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:11,540
When it did the...

4789
03:39:11,540 --> 03:39:11,820
Pew!

4790
03:39:12,120 --> 03:39:13,760
I thought I was gonna do like the...

4791
03:39:13,760 --> 03:39:14,400
Pew!

4792
03:39:16,520 --> 03:39:17,160
You know?

4793
03:39:17,640 --> 03:39:18,500
You know what I'm saying?

4794
03:39:19,200 --> 03:39:19,860
Like the...

4795
03:39:19,860 --> 03:39:20,280
Not the...

4796
03:39:20,280 --> 03:39:20,500
Pew!

4797
03:39:20,740 --> 03:39:21,160
But the...

4798
03:39:21,160 --> 03:39:21,660
Pew!

4799
03:39:23,160 --> 03:39:24,100
You get what I'm saying?

4800
03:39:30,680 --> 03:39:31,740
They are quite fast.

4801
03:39:31,880 --> 03:39:32,040
Yeah.

4802
03:39:32,100 --> 03:39:32,680
They're pretty...

4803
03:39:32,680 --> 03:39:33,580
They're pretty speedy.

4804
03:39:35,040 --> 03:39:35,480
Yeah.

4805
03:39:35,480 --> 03:39:35,840
Yeah.

4806
03:39:35,900 --> 03:39:36,300
Yeah.

4807
03:39:36,300 --> 03:39:36,640
Yeah.

4808
03:39:36,660 --> 03:39:36,940
Yeah.

4809
03:39:36,940 --> 03:39:37,320
Yeah.

4810
03:39:37,320 --> 03:39:37,400
Yeah.

4811
03:39:37,400 --> 03:39:37,440
Yeah.

4812
03:39:39,040 --> 03:39:39,480
Yeah.

4813
03:39:39,480 --> 03:39:41,260
The key is to avoid the missiles.

4814
03:39:41,920 --> 03:39:42,400
Oh!

4815
03:39:42,600 --> 03:39:42,920
Okay.

4816
03:39:43,880 --> 03:39:47,260
That makes so much more sense than how I was doing it.

4817
03:39:47,400 --> 03:39:47,720
So...

4818
03:39:47,720 --> 03:39:48,820
Thank you for that tip.

4819
03:39:48,920 --> 03:39:49,260
Actually.

4820
03:40:02,720 --> 03:40:03,680
Fuck you!

4821
03:40:03,820 --> 03:40:04,200
Fuck you!

4822
03:40:04,300 --> 03:40:04,500
Fuck you!

4823
03:40:28,580 --> 03:40:29,640
There we go.

4824
03:40:33,540 --> 03:40:34,020
Okay.

4825
03:40:34,400 --> 03:40:34,880
Okay.

4826
03:40:38,140 --> 03:40:38,640
Oh

4827
03:40:43,180 --> 03:40:43,720
my gosh!

4828
03:40:44,540 --> 03:40:45,100
Oh no!

4829
03:40:51,400 --> 03:40:51,900
Ow!

4830
03:40:53,540 --> 03:40:56,160
I don't even have enough time to punch a crate.

4831
03:40:58,940 --> 03:41:01,940
I forgot to save before I equipped the grenades.

4832
03:41:02,100 --> 03:41:02,440
My bad.

4833
03:41:06,340 --> 03:41:07,280
This one's tricky.

4834
03:41:07,620 --> 03:41:10,940
I don't even know if my grenades work when I threw it in there.

4835
03:41:15,790 --> 03:41:17,250
And there's four of them.

4836
03:41:18,910 --> 03:41:19,310
Throw!

4837
03:41:20,290 --> 03:41:21,530
Why isn't it throwing?

4838
03:41:24,010 --> 03:41:24,970
Why didn't it throw?

4839
03:41:26,810 --> 03:41:27,250
Wait.

4840
03:41:32,880 --> 03:41:34,220
How am I supposed to reach it now?

4841
03:41:34,520 --> 03:41:35,240
Oh my god.

4842
03:41:41,760 --> 03:41:42,200
Wait.

4843
03:41:42,300 --> 03:41:42,500
What?

4844
03:41:43,200 --> 03:41:44,740
Oh, they eventually burn out though.

4845
03:41:45,960 --> 03:41:47,040
Why isn't it throwing?

4846
03:41:51,700 --> 03:41:53,240
They do eventually burn out.

4847
03:41:54,280 --> 03:41:54,720
Oh man.

4848
03:41:57,770 --> 03:41:58,370
Oh no.

4849
03:41:58,370 --> 03:41:58,750
Oh my gosh.

4850
03:42:04,390 --> 03:42:06,190
The grenades do so little damage.

4851
03:42:09,250 --> 03:42:10,090
It's very low.

4852
03:42:10,190 --> 03:42:11,170
You need to throw a lot of them.

4853
03:42:11,310 --> 03:42:11,490
Okay.

4854
03:42:11,710 --> 03:42:12,270
Oh, whoops.

4855
03:42:17,210 --> 03:42:17,610
Okay.

4856
03:42:17,610 --> 03:42:21,630
So I have to kind of like...

4857
03:42:41,200 --> 03:42:41,800
Oh my god.

4858
03:42:46,080 --> 03:42:46,620
I can't...

4859
03:42:48,260 --> 03:42:50,860
I can't walk anywhere on this damn place!

4860
03:42:52,320 --> 03:42:53,240
This sucks.

4861
03:42:53,440 --> 03:42:54,440
This... This sucks.

4862
03:42:54,660 --> 03:42:55,660
This sucks.

4863
03:42:55,920 --> 03:42:57,100
This sucks bad.

4864
03:42:58,240 --> 03:42:59,460
This sucks bad.

4865
03:43:00,060 --> 03:43:01,340
My timing sucks.

4866
03:43:02,260 --> 03:43:03,440
My health sucks.

4867
03:43:03,760 --> 03:43:04,620
This sucks.

4868
03:43:06,800 --> 03:43:08,420
I don't have any rockets.

4869
03:43:08,580 --> 03:43:09,580
I think I have...

4870
03:43:09,580 --> 03:43:11,960
Oh, I have a singular rocket.

4871
03:43:12,140 --> 03:43:13,220
So I could use...

4872
03:43:13,880 --> 03:43:15,060
My singular rocket.

4873
03:43:16,940 --> 03:43:18,060
I wonder though...

4874
03:43:19,220 --> 03:43:19,920
If it...

4875
03:43:20,600 --> 03:43:22,280
If I could be walking with it.

4876
03:43:34,320 --> 03:43:35,620
Can I just leave?

4877
03:43:51,520 --> 03:43:51,960
Okay.

4878
03:43:52,080 --> 03:43:53,040
I thought they would be...

4879
03:43:53,040 --> 03:43:53,520
Okay.

4880
03:43:53,580 --> 03:43:54,080
So there we go.

4881
03:43:55,140 --> 03:43:55,580
Really

4882
03:44:16,250 --> 03:44:18,270
do just such a small amount of damage, huh?

4883
03:44:19,310 --> 03:44:19,750
Okay.

4884
03:44:23,470 --> 03:44:25,570
And I can't... You can't like spam.

4885
03:44:25,770 --> 03:44:26,390
That's the annoying thing.

4886
03:44:26,390 --> 03:44:31,210
The annoying thing is you can't really spam the grenades because you throw them so little at a time.

4887
03:44:36,000 --> 03:44:38,240
I can't get the stride down at all.

4888
03:44:46,620 --> 03:44:48,500
I'll let you go out in style.

4889
03:44:53,300 --> 03:44:54,780
Speedrun stride is simply a fun...

4890
03:44:54,780 --> 03:44:54,920
Yeah!

4891
03:44:54,920 --> 03:44:59,160
I think the tower does no damage.

4892
03:44:59,420 --> 03:44:59,720
I don't know.

4893
03:45:03,490 --> 03:45:05,610
I like how the rocket just went...

4894
03:45:06,170 --> 03:45:07,670
Right over the top.

4895
03:45:07,770 --> 03:45:09,670
I had a feeling that would happen but...

4896
03:45:11,410 --> 03:45:12,530
It just...

4897
03:45:12,530 --> 03:45:15,670
A single grenade can blow up to four to five crates in one blast.

4898
03:45:16,590 --> 03:45:17,150
Oh...

4899
03:45:21,780 --> 03:45:23,820
Now you're thinking with portals.

4900
03:45:29,170 --> 03:45:30,290
Now you're thinking with portals.

4901
03:45:30,290 --> 03:45:30,370
Now you're thinking with portals.

4902
03:45:35,770 --> 03:45:36,230
Now you're thinking with portals.

4903
03:45:36,230 --> 03:45:37,890
So if I like hit here...

4904
03:45:40,930 --> 03:45:43,530
Actually it doesn't change too much but it does...

4905
03:45:44,390 --> 03:45:45,250
Do good.

4906
03:45:47,810 --> 03:45:48,450
I

4907
03:46:02,300 --> 03:46:03,400
have no more grenades.

4908
03:46:03,800 --> 03:46:05,100
I think I'm in trouble actually.

4909
03:46:06,860 --> 03:46:07,180
Oh!

4910
03:46:08,140 --> 03:46:09,800
The rocket launcher...

4911
03:46:09,800 --> 03:46:09,980
Wait.

4912
03:46:10,140 --> 03:46:11,760
The rocket launcher can...

4913
03:46:15,140 --> 03:46:16,440
Can get the tower.

4914
03:46:26,150 --> 03:46:26,530
Oh my gosh.

4915
03:46:26,630 --> 03:46:26,930
Come on.

4916
03:46:28,470 --> 03:46:29,730
That wasn't even fair.

4917
03:46:37,930 --> 03:46:38,850
What the...

4918
03:46:38,850 --> 03:46:39,870
Oh my god.

4919
03:46:41,250 --> 03:46:41,710
Okay.

4920
03:46:50,870 --> 03:46:51,890
First things first.

4921
03:46:52,470 --> 03:46:53,730
We blow up all the crates.

4922
03:46:54,990 --> 03:46:55,990
First things first.

4923
03:46:56,530 --> 03:46:58,070
We're taking care of those crates.

4924
03:47:10,360 --> 03:47:11,320
Oh!

4925
03:47:18,830 --> 03:47:19,970
Rocket launcher.

4926
03:47:24,350 --> 03:47:25,310
Oh!

4927
03:47:25,350 --> 03:47:26,030
Come on!

4928
03:47:27,650 --> 03:47:29,430
Come on, man!

4929
03:48:31,240 --> 03:48:32,200
Why

4930
03:48:47,290 --> 03:48:49,370
do I get hit every time?

4931
03:48:49,370 --> 03:48:49,390
Why do I get hit every time?

4932
03:48:50,270 --> 03:48:51,230
Oh!

4933
03:48:51,250 --> 03:48:52,410
Oh my gosh!

4934
03:48:56,070 --> 03:48:58,110
I can't move with the...

4935
03:49:01,500 --> 03:49:05,400
I can't move with the crates!

4936
03:49:12,980 --> 03:49:15,040
No, that's not what I meant to do.

4937
03:50:01,690 --> 03:50:02,050
My

4938
03:50:05,240 --> 03:50:08,120
finger placement and it messed me up.

4939
03:50:21,020 --> 03:50:23,640
Moving my fingers... I moved my fingers over and it...

4940
03:50:23,640 --> 03:50:25,320
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

4941
03:50:27,800 --> 03:50:28,980
Okay, hold on.

4942
03:50:29,040 --> 03:50:30,120
I gotta get re-situated.

4943
03:50:32,920 --> 03:50:33,380
Okay,

4944
03:50:54,520 --> 03:50:57,480
so some of you guys said that going that vertically makes me slower.

4945
03:50:59,000 --> 03:51:00,880
What kind of sense does that make?

4946
03:51:03,540 --> 03:51:05,460
But I see it happening every time.

4947
03:51:11,320 --> 03:51:12,240
Oh my gosh.

4948
03:51:17,180 --> 03:51:18,360
I'm just gonna take...

4949
03:51:43,000 --> 03:51:46,530
Oh my god, fuck it.

4950
03:51:46,610 --> 03:51:47,410
I'm just gonna die.

4951
03:51:47,690 --> 03:51:48,250
I'm just gonna die.

4952
03:51:50,170 --> 03:51:50,690
Sigh...

4953
03:52:51,260 --> 03:52:52,060
Oh my

4954
03:53:44,500 --> 03:53:50,760
god.

4955
03:53:56,050 --> 03:53:56,930
I'm so scared.

4956
03:53:56,930 --> 03:53:57,410
I hate the...

4957
03:54:00,270 --> 03:54:00,990
You

4958
03:54:14,740 --> 03:54:16,260
guys, I don't think it's...

4959
03:54:17,500 --> 03:54:19,640
I don't think it's possible.

4960
03:54:51,390 --> 03:54:51,710
Invincible.

4961
03:54:51,730 --> 03:54:58,670
Oh, but my grenades!

4962
03:55:01,370 --> 03:55:02,930
What if I had gone on the other side?

4963
03:55:03,850 --> 03:55:04,910
I would have made it through.

4964
03:55:15,910 --> 03:55:17,310
Thank you, thank you.

4965
03:55:17,570 --> 03:55:19,450
Thank you for revealing your position.

4966
03:55:21,310 --> 03:55:23,070
Hey Fox, are you there?

4967
03:55:23,450 --> 03:55:24,730
Here I am, Robert.

4968
03:55:25,330 --> 03:55:27,830
Fox, the comms are fucking lit.

4969
03:55:28,090 --> 03:55:30,450
They're sending everything they have to the docks.

4970
03:55:30,930 --> 03:55:32,650
What the hell did you do?

4971
03:55:33,850 --> 03:55:34,650
I sank a nuclear submarine.

4972
03:55:35,370 --> 03:55:38,050
That'll teach it not to launch its missiles at me.

4973
03:55:38,290 --> 03:55:39,490
Are you kidding me?

4974
03:55:39,770 --> 03:55:40,590
I'm serious.

4975
03:55:40,950 --> 03:55:43,490
Good thing it wasn't armed with nuclear warheads.

4976
03:55:43,750 --> 03:55:47,010
They must be saving them for Operation Jericho.

4977
03:55:47,610 --> 03:55:53,390
Speaking of nukes, I'm hearing a lot of chatter that they're prepping their to the Omega building.

4978
03:55:53,670 --> 03:55:57,310
Man, if you don't stop them, there's gonna be a worldwide bloodbath.

4979
03:55:57,490 --> 03:55:59,070
I won't be stopping them.

4980
03:55:59,370 --> 03:56:00,990
But who else will?

4981
03:56:00,990 --> 03:56:02,430
I don't care, Robert.

4982
03:56:02,710 --> 03:56:06,890
Right now, I don't need to be recruited by another colonel to save the world.

4983
03:56:07,150 --> 03:56:09,570
Right now, I just need to save my ass.

4984
03:56:10,170 --> 03:56:15,850
And the moment I find anything, even a pool float, I'm getting the hell out of here.

4985
03:56:17,390 --> 03:56:18,710
A pool floaty.

4986
03:56:19,550 --> 03:56:21,750
I'm going back to my chloroform.

4987
03:56:24,810 --> 03:56:25,850
Oh, wait.

4988
03:56:27,090 --> 03:56:28,170
What's S mean?

4989
03:56:28,170 --> 03:56:29,170
Oh, wait.

4990
03:56:29,230 --> 03:56:30,950
These are like the quick controls, aren't they?

4991
03:56:32,090 --> 03:56:34,870
Actually, I haven't used it because I'm not sure how to.

4992
03:56:36,090 --> 03:56:37,270
Would you look at that?

4993
03:56:37,350 --> 03:56:38,490
There's a little metal over there.

4994
03:56:38,910 --> 03:56:40,090
It's probably safe.

4995
03:56:42,150 --> 03:56:43,350
It's probably safe.

4996
03:56:44,710 --> 03:56:45,430
Did it save?

4997
03:56:45,570 --> 03:56:45,770
It did.

4998
03:56:48,450 --> 03:56:49,150
Oh, gosh.

4999
03:56:49,410 --> 03:56:49,970
Get up.

5000
03:56:50,010 --> 03:56:50,190
Get up.

5001
03:56:51,510 --> 03:56:52,050
Get up.

5002
03:56:53,490 --> 03:56:54,070
Get up.

5003
03:56:58,170 --> 03:56:58,250
Gasoline!

5004
03:56:59,630 --> 03:57:00,730
I don't know what I need that for.

5005
03:57:00,810 --> 03:57:01,630
Didn't we have that before?

5006
03:57:02,410 --> 03:57:03,410
Then we threw it out.

5007
03:57:04,310 --> 03:57:05,430
Didn't we have gasoline before?

5008
03:57:06,010 --> 03:57:07,170
I think we threw it out though.

5009
03:57:07,230 --> 03:57:07,450
Hold on.

5010
03:57:15,010 --> 03:57:17,090
I'm trying to fix something on my second monitor.

5011
03:57:26,840 --> 03:57:28,800
I was like, why can't I see on it?

5012
03:57:28,900 --> 03:57:30,220
It's because the brightness is all the way down.

5013
03:57:34,720 --> 03:57:35,360
Hello, sirs.

5014
03:57:37,640 --> 03:57:40,440
I'm going to throw a really cool penny at you guys.

5015
03:57:41,860 --> 03:57:42,260
Okay?

5016
03:57:44,240 --> 03:57:45,840
You're not even ever going to see it coming.

5017
03:58:04,160 --> 03:58:05,520
I at least got one of them.

5018
03:58:07,320 --> 03:58:07,720
Hey!

5019
03:58:12,480 --> 03:58:13,220
I'll take it.

5020
03:58:13,580 --> 03:58:13,980
Actually...

5021
03:58:14,800 --> 03:58:15,500
Oh, wait.

5022
03:58:15,560 --> 03:58:16,360
I think I already had it.

5023
03:58:16,860 --> 03:58:17,400
That's fine.

5024
03:58:19,780 --> 03:58:20,400
I did.

5025
03:58:23,080 --> 03:58:23,800
I'll take it.

5026
03:58:26,500 --> 03:58:27,420
Useless stuff.

5027
03:58:28,100 --> 03:58:29,120
Well, I'll take it.

5028
03:58:30,680 --> 03:58:32,980
Thanks, game, for being kind.

5029
03:58:35,040 --> 03:58:35,500
Anyway.

5030
03:58:36,000 --> 03:58:37,100
I'm going to heal up first.

5031
03:58:40,890 --> 03:58:43,410
It would have been hilarious if they both fought over the coin.

5032
03:58:43,510 --> 03:58:45,820
I didn't expect the one guy to notice me though.

5033
03:58:48,850 --> 03:58:51,790
Inside that hangar, I found what I was looking for.

5034
03:58:52,350 --> 03:58:53,870
Boats I needed to escape.

5035
03:58:54,250 --> 03:58:54,510
Yippee!

5036
03:58:55,850 --> 03:58:57,730
There was a zodiac motorboat.

5037
03:58:57,750 --> 03:58:58,630
And a hovercraft.

5038
03:58:59,050 --> 03:59:02,950
The zodiac was the faster and more maneuverable choice in the world.

5039
03:59:02,970 --> 03:59:04,190
I've ridden one of those in Antarctica.

5040
03:59:04,190 --> 03:59:08,110
But hovercrafts were versatile and could pass over terrain where zodiacs could not.

5041
03:59:09,530 --> 03:59:12,570
I rode a zodiac in Antarctica.

5042
03:59:14,270 --> 03:59:16,610
So I think I must go with the zodiac.

5043
03:59:18,450 --> 03:59:19,490
Out of experience.

5044
03:59:21,330 --> 03:59:22,630
It is my...

5045
03:59:22,630 --> 03:59:24,410
I'm an experienced driver.

5046
03:59:24,770 --> 03:59:26,650
Did I drive the zodiac myself?

5047
03:59:28,050 --> 03:59:30,750
Did we also almost get trapped in the ice in the zodiac?

5048
03:59:31,330 --> 03:59:31,790
Yeah.

5049
03:59:34,150 --> 03:59:34,610
Were...

5050
03:59:34,610 --> 03:59:38,490
Was I scared because the guy was just like, I don't think we should be in here.

5051
03:59:38,630 --> 03:59:39,710
And he still went in anyway?

5052
03:59:40,190 --> 03:59:40,650
Yeah.

5053
03:59:45,450 --> 03:59:46,370
You know.

5054
03:59:48,130 --> 03:59:49,190
So this one is...

5055
03:59:49,190 --> 03:59:51,810
As I checked the hovercraft, I found out that.

5056
03:59:52,130 --> 03:59:52,370
Oh.

5057
03:59:55,810 --> 03:59:56,550
Get what...

5058
03:59:56,550 --> 03:59:57,850
Get sleep...

5059
03:59:58,380 --> 03:59:59,350
Get sleep...

5060
03:59:59,350 --> 04:00:02,090
Get well...

5061
04:00:02,090 --> 04:00:03,290
Get well soon...

5062
04:00:03,290 --> 04:00:04,090
Later.

5063
04:00:05,530 --> 04:00:06,350
Get well soon later.

5064
04:00:08,530 --> 04:00:10,370
Its gas tank was empty.

5065
04:00:10,590 --> 04:00:10,690
Oh!

5066
04:00:11,390 --> 04:00:12,010
Gasoline!

5067
04:00:12,450 --> 04:00:15,490
As I checked the zodiac, I found out that.

5068
04:00:18,370 --> 04:00:20,250
Its gas tank was empty.

5069
04:00:23,150 --> 04:00:23,590
Oh!

5070
04:00:23,710 --> 04:00:24,510
What did you...

5071
04:00:24,510 --> 04:00:28,070
What did you know that I had two things of gasoline?

5072
04:00:34,310 --> 04:00:35,210
What did you know?

5073
04:00:35,890 --> 04:00:36,670
What did you...

5074
04:00:37,570 --> 04:00:38,010
Wow.

5075
04:00:44,510 --> 04:00:44,950
Oh!

5076
04:00:44,970 --> 04:00:45,170
Oh!

5077
04:00:45,230 --> 04:00:46,390
I guess we made our choice.

5078
04:00:46,790 --> 04:00:47,770
Left, right to move.

5079
04:00:47,910 --> 04:00:48,690
Space to shoot.

5080
04:00:48,810 --> 04:00:49,450
Machine gun?

5081
04:00:52,290 --> 04:00:53,170
Oh my god.

5082
04:00:53,190 --> 04:00:53,870
It's really fast.

5083
04:01:07,820 --> 04:01:08,620
How high?

5084
04:01:26,320 --> 04:01:26,740
Okay.

5085
04:01:26,800 --> 04:01:28,520
I'm just going to focus on the road, you guys.

5086
04:01:28,760 --> 04:01:29,680
Just going to focus.

5087
04:01:29,760 --> 04:01:32,120
Because this is one of the rare guns that I can actually...

5088
04:01:33,020 --> 04:01:35,040
Just shoot and not even...

5089
04:01:37,940 --> 04:01:40,100
Not even have to spam it.

5090
04:01:40,180 --> 04:01:41,040
I can just shoot.

5091
04:01:41,200 --> 04:01:41,760
I can just shoot.

5092
04:01:41,860 --> 04:01:42,060
Ah!

5093
04:01:48,150 --> 04:01:49,050
What about this one?

5094
04:01:49,110 --> 04:01:50,610
This one is slower though, right?

5095
04:01:50,730 --> 04:01:51,910
But I can go over more terrain.

5096
04:01:52,130 --> 04:01:53,350
I think this one is still better.

5097
04:01:54,850 --> 04:01:55,210
No.

5098
04:01:55,310 --> 04:01:56,130
Not combined.

5099
04:01:56,350 --> 04:01:56,590
There we go.

5100
04:01:59,390 --> 04:01:59,750
It

5101
04:02:10,620 --> 04:02:11,380
might work.

5102
04:02:33,660 --> 04:02:34,020
Nonsense!

5103
04:02:43,090 --> 04:02:43,450
Okay.

5104
04:02:43,690 --> 04:02:44,670
I'm going to try the other boat.

5105
04:02:44,750 --> 04:02:47,990
Just because I'm curious how well that one will work.

5106
04:02:48,930 --> 04:02:49,290
Just because I'm curious how well that one will work.

5107
04:02:49,310 --> 04:02:50,550
We fly off immediately, right?

5108
04:02:51,290 --> 04:02:52,310
Shoot the missile!

5109
04:02:53,730 --> 04:02:54,210
Oh...

5110
04:02:56,490 --> 04:02:58,250
This got some drift on it.

5111
04:03:05,090 --> 04:03:05,810
Oh no.

5112
04:03:05,890 --> 04:03:06,390
This sucks.

5113
04:03:06,690 --> 04:03:07,730
It's going to be way too slow.

5114
04:03:10,350 --> 04:03:11,630
Let's do heavy damage.

5115
04:03:13,310 --> 04:03:15,090
It's going to be way too slow, I think.

5116
04:03:16,670 --> 04:03:19,010
And it takes like a second to reload and everything.

5117
04:03:19,010 --> 04:03:19,130
And it takes like a second to reload and everything.

5118
04:03:20,570 --> 04:03:20,970
See?

5119
04:03:21,070 --> 04:03:21,790
I can't even hit.

5120
04:03:21,850 --> 04:03:22,410
Get one-hitted.

5121
04:03:24,430 --> 04:03:24,830
See?

5122
04:03:26,610 --> 04:03:26,610
I can't even hit.

5123
04:03:26,610 --> 04:03:26,610
Get one-hitted.

5124
04:03:26,610 --> 04:03:27,390
I suck at this.

5125
04:03:27,530 --> 04:03:27,570
I suck at this.

5126
04:03:29,050 --> 04:03:29,710
Aiming doko.

5127
04:03:35,020 --> 04:03:35,860
Oh my god.

5128
04:03:36,020 --> 04:03:36,140
Oh my god.

5129
04:03:36,180 --> 04:03:37,700
It's because it's too slow.

5130
04:03:38,760 --> 04:03:39,560
Too slow.

5131
04:03:44,990 --> 04:03:46,050
You're too slow.

5132
04:03:47,550 --> 04:03:48,310
What is this?

5133
04:03:48,410 --> 04:03:50,190
I can't tell if it's a movie or a TV show.

5134
04:03:50,250 --> 04:03:51,030
What is this?

5135
04:03:51,050 --> 04:03:51,650
I can't tell if it's a movie or a TV show.

5136
04:03:52,130 --> 04:03:54,490
And then I recognize this girl from Sabrina.

5137
04:03:54,730 --> 04:03:56,430
And then this guy...

5138
04:03:57,450 --> 04:03:58,930
I don't recognize him.

5139
04:03:59,050 --> 04:03:59,330
Sorry.

5140
04:03:59,410 --> 04:04:00,310
I have my TV on.

5141
04:04:01,130 --> 04:04:01,650
Hold on.

5142
04:04:02,110 --> 04:04:03,350
I'm just going to turn up the...

5143
04:04:03,350 --> 04:04:04,110
That's Tom Holland.

5144
04:04:04,350 --> 04:04:05,130
That's the Spider-Man.

5145
04:04:05,290 --> 04:04:05,670
Right?

5146
04:04:05,750 --> 04:04:07,230
Tom Holland is Spider-Man.

5147
04:04:08,710 --> 04:04:10,810
This guy looks like House, but I know he's not House.

5148
04:04:11,790 --> 04:04:12,170
It

5149
04:04:18,340 --> 04:04:19,520
looks like a spy movie.

5150
04:04:19,640 --> 04:04:19,860
Oh wait!

5151
04:04:20,680 --> 04:04:21,760
I missed the name.

5152
04:04:21,880 --> 04:04:23,540
It was in Nihongo.

5153
04:04:27,140 --> 04:04:27,520
Huh?

5154
04:04:28,420 --> 04:04:29,180
Can you hear it?

5155
04:04:33,420 --> 04:04:34,180
Who is that?

5156
04:04:37,200 --> 04:04:37,740
Uncharted?

5157
04:04:40,840 --> 04:04:41,680
Black Thunder.

5158
04:04:41,820 --> 04:04:43,540
That might be a reference to the movie Blue Thunder.

5159
04:04:45,320 --> 04:04:46,400
Are they...

5160
04:04:47,900 --> 04:04:49,660
You can hear it just a little bit.

5161
04:04:49,940 --> 04:04:52,180
It looks like a spy movie.

5162
04:04:52,420 --> 04:04:52,620
Okay.

5163
04:04:52,720 --> 04:04:53,080
Anyway.

5164
04:04:53,600 --> 04:04:54,140
Sorry.

5165
04:04:54,620 --> 04:04:55,500
My attention.

5166
04:04:56,320 --> 04:04:56,860
Okay.

5167
04:04:57,240 --> 04:04:57,860
Let's go.

5168
04:05:37,510 --> 04:05:39,790
There's only two hits and you're over.

5169
04:05:45,360 --> 04:05:46,640
I'm going to turn the volume down though.

5170
04:05:47,080 --> 04:05:47,940
It's a little loud.

5171
04:05:48,540 --> 04:05:49,320
Black Thunder!

5172
04:06:14,980 --> 04:06:16,500
There's so many missiles.

5173
04:06:18,160 --> 04:06:18,600
Oh!

5174
04:06:18,620 --> 04:06:18,800
Oh!

5175
04:06:18,820 --> 04:06:20,340
I was not paying attention to the road.

5176
04:06:21,620 --> 04:06:23,040
It's like the number one rule.

5177
04:06:23,220 --> 04:06:24,760
I said pay attention to the road.

5178
04:06:31,580 --> 04:06:33,360
Maybe I should go back with this one.

5179
04:06:39,370 --> 04:06:40,470
This one is slower.

5180
04:06:40,630 --> 04:06:41,350
Slow and steady.

5181
04:06:41,490 --> 04:06:41,950
Right guys?

5182
04:06:44,550 --> 04:06:45,410
Slow and steady.

5183
04:06:46,310 --> 04:06:47,290
Black Thunder!

5184
04:06:50,570 --> 04:06:50,900
Oh!

5185
04:06:50,980 --> 04:06:51,340
Never mind.

5186
04:06:54,920 --> 04:06:55,580
Okay.

5187
04:06:55,760 --> 04:06:56,980
Let's go back to the Zodiac.

5188
04:07:09,240 --> 04:07:11,180
I wasn't steady at all.

5189
04:07:35,930 --> 04:07:37,390
It gets so narrow.

5190
04:07:42,980 --> 04:07:44,400
It gets so narrow.

5191
04:07:47,220 --> 04:07:48,700
It gets so narrow.

5192
04:07:53,610 --> 04:07:55,330
Get hit by one bomb at least.

5193
04:07:55,450 --> 04:07:56,950
Get hit by two bombs.

5194
04:07:57,470 --> 04:07:57,630
Yeah.

5195
04:08:38,040 --> 04:08:39,120
Number seven.

5196
04:08:40,820 --> 04:08:41,840
Oh my gosh.

5197
04:08:41,840 --> 04:08:43,640
I've already been streaming for four hours.

5198
04:08:45,440 --> 04:08:45,720
Um.

5199
04:08:48,040 --> 04:08:48,680
Hmm.

5200
04:08:50,200 --> 04:08:51,940
Thousand eyes are watching you.

5201
04:08:52,160 --> 04:08:56,780
The confrontation with that chopper exhausted every drop of gas I had left.

5202
04:08:57,120 --> 04:09:00,480
With no gas, the engine stopped shortly thereafter.

5203
04:09:01,060 --> 04:09:01,740
The confrontation with that chopper exhausted every drop of gas I had left.

5204
04:09:01,760 --> 04:09:05,260
Despite the dangers, I used my own arms to paddle forward.

5205
04:09:05,500 --> 04:09:05,640
Despite the dangers, I used my own arms to paddle forward.

5206
04:09:05,640 --> 04:09:06,180
He can swim!

5207
04:09:07,620 --> 04:09:11,200
Piranhas and crocodiles constantly tried to eat my hands.

5208
04:09:11,200 --> 04:09:11,340
Piranhas and crocodiles constantly tried to eat my hands.

5209
04:09:11,340 --> 04:09:12,800
Why does he keep making this stuff up?

5210
04:09:13,220 --> 04:09:16,300
But I was lucky enough to make it to a small dock.

5211
04:09:16,740 --> 04:09:17,020
But I was lucky enough to make it to a small dock.

5212
04:09:17,020 --> 04:09:19,800
He's making it so much more difficult for me.

5213
04:09:20,740 --> 04:09:21,220
Oh.

5214
04:09:22,840 --> 04:09:24,240
Wait, but the boat is here.

5215
04:09:24,520 --> 04:09:26,820
That contradicts your story, Jesse Fox.

5216
04:09:27,220 --> 04:09:27,260
That contradicts your story, Jesse Fox.

5217
04:09:29,120 --> 04:09:29,600
That's a great story.

5218
04:09:33,100 --> 04:09:34,300
You doubt him?

5219
04:09:35,660 --> 04:09:36,540
I'm just saying.

5220
04:09:39,620 --> 04:09:42,400
I'm trying to decide if I want to end it here now, you guys.

5221
04:09:42,600 --> 04:09:49,660
I've got some stuff I need to do before I go out today, so...

5222
04:09:49,660 --> 04:09:52,980
I've got some stuff I need to do before Oh, please don't kill me!

5223
04:09:53,520 --> 04:09:55,140
Why would I want to kill you?

5224
04:09:55,680 --> 04:09:56,400
Hold on.

5225
04:09:58,420 --> 04:10:00,280
He's like getting rid of the fence.

5226
04:10:20,100 --> 04:10:23,660
They took it!

5227
04:10:26,400 --> 04:10:26,760
That place.

5228
04:10:27,240 --> 04:10:31,120
It was isolated, with no roads or towns nearby.

5229
04:10:31,700 --> 04:10:36,040
And most importantly, he told me about what I might encounter up ahead.

5230
04:10:36,420 --> 04:10:36,720
Uh oh.

5231
04:10:37,080 --> 04:10:38,960
What might I encounter up ahead?

5232
04:10:41,320 --> 04:10:46,200
What... what might I... what might I encounter up ahead?

5233
04:10:57,620 --> 04:10:59,020
Security cameras!

5234
04:10:59,340 --> 04:11:00,340
A surveillance camera!

5235
04:11:01,960 --> 04:11:06,900
There, hidden in the middle of the jungle, stood a compound riddled with cameras.

5236
04:11:07,540 --> 04:11:10,200
The level of security was sky high.

5237
04:11:10,580 --> 04:11:12,600
Like the mansion of a cartel boss.

5238
04:11:13,040 --> 04:11:14,300
And I could see why.

5239
04:11:14,800 --> 04:11:18,100
Because the center of this fortress was the Omega Building.

5240
04:11:18,440 --> 04:11:20,860
The heart of Operation Jericho.

5241
04:11:21,260 --> 04:11:25,920
The old man told me that he saw some helicopters landing on top of the building.

5242
04:11:26,240 --> 04:11:29,640
If I stole one of them, that would be my ticket out of there.

5243
04:11:30,120 --> 04:11:31,580
One thing was for sure.

5244
04:11:31,600 --> 04:11:38,000
If I was detected by a camera, and the alarm triggered, they would put the Omega Building in lockdown.

5245
04:11:38,440 --> 04:11:40,620
And I could kiss those helicopters goodbye.

5246
04:11:41,000 --> 04:11:50,440
But none of that matters because, even though I was already showing signs of exhaustion, I slid in like a shadow and managed to go undetected.

5247
04:11:51,340 --> 04:11:52,100
I did?

5248
04:11:54,260 --> 04:11:55,460
Like a shadow?

5249
04:11:55,800 --> 04:11:57,360
Right underneath their noses.

5250
04:11:57,760 --> 04:11:58,520
Like that.

5251
04:11:58,680 --> 04:12:00,780
The door was locked and chained.

5252
04:12:01,600 --> 04:12:02,660
There was nobody outside.

5253
04:12:03,080 --> 04:12:05,820
So finding the key for the lock wasn't an option.

5254
04:12:06,140 --> 04:12:08,820
I could cut the chain with a bolt cutter, but...

5255
04:12:08,820 --> 04:12:10,220
Where would I find one?

5256
04:12:12,720 --> 04:12:13,500
We know.

5257
04:12:14,020 --> 04:12:16,520
I wish they showed us what the, um...

5258
04:12:17,800 --> 04:12:19,380
What the degree...

5259
04:12:19,380 --> 04:12:20,500
Give me that bolt cutter.

5260
04:12:21,120 --> 04:12:21,640
But...

5261
04:12:22,320 --> 04:12:23,360
It's mine.

5262
04:12:24,960 --> 04:12:26,240
We're just like them!

5263
04:12:26,360 --> 04:12:27,960
Now, it's mine.

5264
04:12:28,300 --> 04:12:29,060
We're just as...

5265
04:12:29,060 --> 04:12:30,260
They took his car?

5266
04:12:30,460 --> 04:12:30,840
They took his...

5267
04:12:30,840 --> 04:12:31,400
Wait, wait, wait.

5268
04:12:31,520 --> 04:12:34,380
Are you saying that you stole from some defenseless old man?

5269
04:12:34,680 --> 04:12:36,520
You're a special sort of monster.

5270
04:12:37,180 --> 04:12:37,500
What?

5271
04:12:37,640 --> 04:12:38,040
Me?

5272
04:12:38,560 --> 04:12:39,780
No, no, no, no, no.

5273
04:12:39,980 --> 04:12:40,460
Jesse...

5274
04:12:40,460 --> 04:12:41,360
I paid him.

5275
04:12:41,520 --> 04:12:44,860
When I said it was practically highway robbery, I meant...

5276
04:12:45,400 --> 04:12:45,880
Jesse...

5277
04:12:45,880 --> 04:12:46,500
Hello, friend.

5278
04:12:47,080 --> 04:12:48,020
Hello, Gramps.

5279
04:12:48,180 --> 04:12:49,700
I want to buy that bolt cutter.

5280
04:12:50,320 --> 04:12:51,520
But, it's mine.

5281
04:12:52,080 --> 04:12:53,960
How much are you willing to pay?

5282
04:12:54,360 --> 04:12:55,540
Here are some coins.

5283
04:12:56,140 --> 04:12:57,760
It's little money, pal.

5284
04:12:58,100 --> 04:12:58,940
I have ten million dollars.

5285
04:12:59,320 --> 04:13:00,820
I also have ten million dollars.

5286
04:13:01,380 --> 04:13:01,900
Okay.

5287
04:13:03,600 --> 04:13:04,720
Thank you, Gramps.

5288
04:13:05,200 --> 04:13:06,640
You're welcome, kid.

5289
04:13:07,560 --> 04:13:09,120
What if I didn't have the money?

5290
04:13:10,100 --> 04:13:11,220
What would have happened?

5291
04:13:12,120 --> 04:13:13,540
If I didn't have the money?

5292
04:13:16,400 --> 04:13:16,920
Okay.

5293
04:13:20,660 --> 04:13:21,180
Okay.

5294
04:13:23,160 --> 04:13:24,580
There's like this old...

5295
04:13:25,660 --> 04:13:28,180
Old Love Hina, like, Newgrounds flash.

5296
04:13:28,660 --> 04:13:30,160
Maybe it wasn't Newgrounds.

5297
04:13:30,160 --> 04:13:31,560
I don't remember where I watched it.

5298
04:13:31,860 --> 04:13:35,780
But it was definitely... not safe for work.

5299
04:13:37,620 --> 04:13:39,720
It was Bpina.

5300
04:13:40,420 --> 04:13:42,680
And it was dubbed.

5301
04:13:43,020 --> 04:13:45,860
And the way that Keitaro just goes, Bokke.

5302
04:13:49,600 --> 04:13:51,320
Makes me laugh every time.

5303
04:13:59,300 --> 04:13:59,840
Bokke.

5304
04:13:59,840 --> 04:14:06,420
And like... like the... like Nauru was about to like start... I think like she...

5305
04:14:06,420 --> 04:14:07,280
Oh my god.

5306
04:14:07,520 --> 04:14:09,120
It's been so long since I watched it.

5307
04:14:09,300 --> 04:14:13,840
I used to... I probably watched it more times than I should admit.

5308
04:14:14,320 --> 04:14:16,880
Because the dub just made me laugh so much.

5309
04:14:19,400 --> 04:14:19,760
Bokke.

5310
04:14:22,160 --> 04:14:22,960
Poor memory.

5311
04:14:23,160 --> 04:14:23,400
True.

5312
04:14:24,020 --> 04:14:25,280
It wasn't Newgrounds though.

5313
04:14:26,860 --> 04:14:28,160
It wasn't Newgrounds.

5314
04:14:28,180 --> 04:14:30,700
The Newgrounds one... The Newgrounds Love Hina, I did play that.

5315
04:14:30,900 --> 04:14:31,660
That was the game.

5316
04:14:32,080 --> 04:14:34,040
But this was like an animated thing.

5317
04:14:38,620 --> 04:14:40,440
And the entire dub was just so bad.

5318
04:14:41,120 --> 04:14:41,800
Why do I say dub?

5319
04:14:41,960 --> 04:14:45,380
I don't know if it was like a dub, or if it was just the voice acting in general, or what.

5320
04:14:48,340 --> 04:14:51,720
On the east side, the cameras were accompanied by guards.

5321
04:14:52,000 --> 04:14:52,160
No!

5322
04:14:52,920 --> 04:14:53,840
Oh my god.

5323
04:14:54,080 --> 04:14:57,640
I needed to pass without being spotted by Mike or the camera.

5324
04:14:57,980 --> 04:14:59,040
What is that over there?

5325
04:14:59,120 --> 04:15:01,380
So, I had to get rid of Mike and leave no witnesses.

5326
04:15:01,800 --> 04:15:04,040
But it was more complicated than that.

5327
04:15:04,480 --> 04:15:07,920
If the camera saw Mike knocked out, lying on the ground...

5328
04:15:07,920 --> 04:15:09,080
It's real Metal Gear!

5329
04:15:09,820 --> 04:15:13,220
Seems you just had to move him away from the view of the camera.

5330
04:15:13,720 --> 04:15:14,240
Exactly.

5331
04:15:14,320 --> 04:15:19,500
But, if Mike wasn't there as the camera viewed his post, the alarm would still be triggered.

5332
04:15:19,920 --> 04:15:23,860
Whatever I did, the camera had to see Mike standing at his post.

5333
04:15:24,080 --> 04:15:24,160
What?

5334
04:15:24,540 --> 04:15:24,660
Hmm.

5335
04:15:25,380 --> 04:15:26,460
Quite the scenario.

5336
04:15:26,900 --> 04:15:30,620
Unless it's an episode of MacGyver, it would be impossible to proceed.

5337
04:15:30,840 --> 04:15:31,220
MacGyver.

5338
04:15:31,220 --> 04:15:31,500
Hold on.

5339
04:15:31,640 --> 04:15:34,100
If you're telling me this, that means you made it through, correct?

5340
04:15:34,760 --> 04:15:35,540
Well, yes.

5341
04:15:35,620 --> 04:15:37,560
I managed to fool the camera eventually.

5342
04:15:38,080 --> 04:15:39,280
How did you manage that?

5343
04:15:39,700 --> 04:15:43,620
If the camera needed to see Mike, I could just make a copy of him.

5344
04:15:43,800 --> 04:15:44,280
What?

5345
04:15:44,420 --> 04:15:45,260
A clone?

5346
04:15:45,300 --> 04:15:45,520
Oh no.

5347
04:15:45,980 --> 04:15:46,460
Yes.

5348
04:15:46,680 --> 04:15:47,620
The copy of him.

5349
04:15:47,620 --> 04:15:50,980
If the copy of him was so perfect, Mike's mother wouldn't know the difference.

5350
04:15:51,320 --> 04:15:51,920
I think it's closed.

5351
04:15:51,940 --> 04:15:54,020
I made the swap when the camera wasn't looking.

5352
04:15:54,280 --> 04:15:55,940
Wait, what do you mean when the camera wasn't looking?

5353
04:15:56,100 --> 04:15:56,800
What is this?

5354
04:15:58,460 --> 04:15:59,860
Oh, the camera moves.

5355
04:16:06,610 --> 04:16:07,010
Okay.

5356
04:16:07,010 --> 04:16:09,590
I know I said I was going to stop, and I did mean that.

5357
04:16:09,970 --> 04:16:13,890
I'm just trying to... I guess earlier would have been a good stopping point, huh?

5358
04:16:17,070 --> 04:16:18,170
We got a string.

5359
04:16:35,350 --> 04:16:36,310
Yeah, I can't see me.

5360
04:16:36,490 --> 04:16:38,030
Look, I even blend in with the wall.

5361
04:16:49,130 --> 04:16:49,450
Okay.

5362
04:16:50,790 --> 04:16:51,410
Okay, guys.

5363
04:16:51,790 --> 04:16:53,250
I think that's it for me for today.

5364
04:16:56,970 --> 04:16:57,290
And...

5365
04:16:59,050 --> 04:17:00,450
We will finish, I think, what?

5366
04:17:00,590 --> 04:17:02,430
It's ten chapters, people said.

5367
04:17:02,570 --> 04:17:03,630
So I'm on chapter seven.

5368
04:17:03,790 --> 04:17:04,870
We only have three more chapters.

5369
04:17:06,030 --> 04:17:07,410
And I can't finish it up.

5370
04:17:08,530 --> 04:17:09,170
Next time.

5371
04:17:09,970 --> 04:17:10,290
Okay.

5372
04:17:12,090 --> 04:17:13,410
I'm so sleepy today.

5373
04:17:14,430 --> 04:17:15,670
But I have work to do.

5374
04:17:15,750 --> 04:17:16,770
And I gotta go do my work.

5375
04:17:17,790 --> 04:17:19,250
Thanks guys for joining me.

5376
04:17:19,390 --> 04:17:20,470
Sorry that I didn't finish.

5377
04:17:21,150 --> 04:17:23,570
I really had full intentions on doing it, but...

5378
04:17:24,850 --> 04:17:25,730
I am...

5379
04:17:26,250 --> 04:17:27,210
I got stuff to do.

5380
04:17:29,090 --> 04:17:32,790
This flashback narration thing is a brilliant way to get across game instruction to players.

5381
04:17:32,830 --> 04:17:33,090
Right!

5382
04:17:33,490 --> 04:17:34,190
It's awesome.

5383
04:17:34,610 --> 04:17:36,010
This game is so fun, actually.

5384
04:17:37,290 --> 04:17:38,250
Thanks for the stream.

5385
04:17:38,310 --> 04:17:40,830
I hope everyone has a good Labor Day weekend.

5386
04:17:41,070 --> 04:17:42,790
Although I don't think they have Labor Day in Japan.

5387
04:17:44,050 --> 04:17:44,490
What?

5388
04:17:44,690 --> 04:17:45,130
It's...

5389
04:17:45,690 --> 04:17:46,950
Is it Labor Day?

5390
04:17:48,970 --> 04:17:49,410
Oh!

5391
04:17:50,230 --> 04:17:51,090
It is Monday.

5392
04:17:53,010 --> 04:17:53,650
It is.

5393
04:17:55,710 --> 04:17:56,890
Well, it's Monday for me.

5394
04:17:57,070 --> 04:17:59,350
It's maybe probably Monday for some of you guys, too.

5395
04:18:00,990 --> 04:18:01,430
Um...

5396
04:18:02,790 --> 04:18:03,230
Yes.

5397
04:18:04,450 --> 04:18:05,990
I'm going to go there.

5398
04:18:07,230 --> 04:18:07,670
So...

5399
04:18:08,290 --> 04:18:09,090
If you're...

5400
04:18:09,090 --> 04:18:12,130
If you have a Labor Day off, get some rest as well.

5401
04:18:13,130 --> 04:18:13,570
And...

5402
04:18:13,570 --> 04:18:14,330
Yeah!

5403
04:18:14,670 --> 04:18:15,630
I don't feel so...

5404
04:18:15,630 --> 04:18:17,530
My tummy hurts only just a little bit, so...

5405
04:18:17,530 --> 04:18:19,550
I think I might be good for today.

5406
04:18:20,530 --> 04:18:20,970
Yeah...

5407
04:18:20,970 --> 04:18:21,690
Okay!

5408
04:18:21,890 --> 04:18:27,630
I'll probably finish it later this week.

5409
04:18:27,750 --> 04:18:29,130
I will put up a schedule.

5410
04:18:29,310 --> 04:18:30,550
I'm trying to figure out a little...

5411
04:18:30,550 --> 04:18:32,110
A little couple...

5412
04:18:32,110 --> 04:18:32,350
Hold on.

5413
04:18:36,250 --> 04:18:36,730
Um...

5414
04:18:37,990 --> 04:18:39,530
And I wrote...

5415
04:18:40,210 --> 04:18:40,690
Yes!

5416
04:18:40,790 --> 04:18:41,030
Oh!

5417
04:18:41,170 --> 04:18:45,510
Because I was supposed to do Love Ghosty yesterday, I'm actually doing it tomorrow instead.

5418
04:18:45,750 --> 04:18:46,450
Same time!

5419
04:18:47,970 --> 04:18:48,930
But, uh...

5420
04:18:49,750 --> 04:18:50,230
Yeah!

5421
04:18:50,410 --> 04:18:52,390
This is actually, like, my last week in Japan.

5422
04:18:52,690 --> 04:18:53,670
So, um...

5423
04:18:54,270 --> 04:18:56,630
From next week, I will have...

5424
04:18:56,630 --> 04:18:58,530
Things will be back to more normal.

5425
04:19:00,510 --> 04:19:00,990
So...

5426
04:19:01,650 --> 04:19:03,510
I can finally go home soon!

5427
04:19:04,330 --> 04:19:04,810
Yippee!

5428
04:19:06,710 --> 04:19:07,410
Yeah.

5429
04:19:07,530 --> 04:19:08,990
So, um...

5430
04:19:08,990 --> 04:19:11,230
I will see you guys later.

5431
04:19:11,700 --> 04:19:12,790
And, um...

5432
04:19:12,790 --> 04:19:13,610
Yeah!

5433
04:19:13,870 --> 04:19:15,430
See you guys later!

5434
04:19:16,230 --> 04:19:17,310
Bye-bye!

5435
04:19:17,590 --> 04:19:18,270
Bye-bye!

5436
04:19:20,750 --> 04:19:22,570
Thanks for watching!

5437
04:19:22,810 --> 04:19:23,590
Thank you!

5438
04:19:23,610 --> 04:19:24,010
Bye-bye!
