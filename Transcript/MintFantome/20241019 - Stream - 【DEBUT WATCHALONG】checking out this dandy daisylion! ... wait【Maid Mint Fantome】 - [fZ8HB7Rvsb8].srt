1
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,070
Oh my god!

2
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,530
My computer is...

3
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,810
Late!

4
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,570
My computer says it's 6...

5
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,510
56...

6
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,130
But my phone says 657!

7
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,810
It's 30 seconds behind!

8
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,830
Oh my god!

9
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,770
How does that happen on a computer?

10
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,370
How does it even happen?

11
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,500
They can sometimes get out of sync?

12
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,460
No way!

13
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,100
Anyway!

14
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,340
Welcome back, master and princess!

15
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,380
I don't have much time to talk before the debut begins.

16
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,480
Welcome!

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,040
Today we'll be watching Daisy Dandelion from Idol EN's debut!

18
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,880
It's actually, I think, my first ever sponsored stream.

19
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,120
So...

20
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,980
Yippee!

21
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,440
Yay!

22
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,220
So... Yay!

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
I've been asked before for other watch-alongs, but...

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,540
I was always busy.

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,380
Or planning other stuff or whatever, so...

26
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,060
But...

27
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,160
You know, I thought maybe I would try it.

28
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,300
And it's fun to watch debuts, so...

29
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,740
You know, it's not like I never watched the other ones before.

30
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,880
But it's also more fun to watch with a crowd of people, so...

31
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,380
Yeah.

32
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,180
But...

33
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,900
Yeah!

34
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,100
So...

35
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,920
Cool!

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,120
I'll stop the music, obviously, once it starts.

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,340
It'll start in two minutes.

38
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,220
I had a bit of a... I'm tired today.

39
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm tired today.

40
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,100
I had to go...

41
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,500
Visit...

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,600
My family.

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,360
So I'm tired.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,760
But yeah.

45
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,460
I don't know what to say.

46
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,300
I feel like I'm gonna be awkward.

47
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,100
I'm gonna be like...

48
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,480
Cute!

49
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,320
And one thing I'm most...

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,540
Rather, one thing I like seeing the most about debuts is...

51
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,480
Zalink you pinned okay.

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,600
Yep, it's all good.

53
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,420
Yep.

54
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,420
No worries.

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,340
But...

56
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,040
One thing I'm most excited to see about...

57
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:47,980
About...

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,760
Vtubers from their debuts is like what their anime likes are, you know?

59
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,260
So...

60
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,360
I guess we'll see that.

61
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,920
And of course, there's the links.

62
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,760
If you are interested in watching.

63
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
Or if you're here, you should watch!

64
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,700
So...

65
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,420
It should be beginning.

66
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm gonna turn off the music just preemptively so that...

67
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,740
When it starts...

68
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm gonna...

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,620
It'll not start with the music.

70
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,940
Bets on who's gonna be the MGS fan.

71
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,540
I'm telling...

72
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,280
I look for it.

73
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,500
Literally every single...

74
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,180
Every single...

75
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,820
Debut I've ever watched.

76
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,920
I was just like, I wonder...

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,080
Oh!

78
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,720
It's starting!

79
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,680
I've always looked to see if they like Metal Gear.

80
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,980
Oh, the intro is so cute!

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,860
I wonder if the stuff on the TV will change.

82
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,260
Let's see, what do they like?

83
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,520
What's some stuff in here that...

84
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,940
I see Tamagotchi.

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,220
Oh!

86
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,500
I think...

87
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:54,680
Oh!

88
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,120
Oh!

89
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,020
We can hear...

90
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,140
Oh!

91
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,000
The Ian scuff.

92
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,740
That was a Love Live reference.

93
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,520
Actually, on...

94
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,560
On...

95
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,720
On Twitter earlier, she said...

96
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,860
So maybe she knows idol stuff.

97
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,040
We'll see.

98
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,340
Moogle in the cabinet?

99
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,540
Oh!

100
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:17,960
I see it!

101
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,480
I see it!

102
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Yeah, there's a Moogle.

103
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,080
We got a Gamecube.

104
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,060
And we have...

105
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,440
What is that?

106
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,140
A Famicom?

107
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,360
So we have maybe a Boomer?

108
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,580
Maybe we have a Boomer?

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,720
Stop!

110
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,200
No!

111
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,480
Thank you for the pink.

112
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,180
No, thank you.

113
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,480
A DS?

114
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:40,820
Where?

115
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,880
Oh, I see a Wii.

116
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,480
I don't see the...

117
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,280
Oh, I see a Switch.

118
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,600
Oh no, she's a gamer?

119
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,520
I see a...

120
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,420
PSP?

121
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,500
Oh, I see...

122
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,460
I think it's a PSP next to the...

123
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,460
Next to the DS.

124
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,400
This is such a cute...

125
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,600
Such a cute intro.

126
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,080
She's so yellow.

127
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,420
A hag for sure.

128
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,540
Let's go.

129
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,460
No respect for the GBA?

130
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,780
Where?

131
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,040
Or is that the PSP?

132
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,080
Is it a PSP or...

133
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,820
I don't even see it.

134
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,100
There's so much stuff.

135
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,180
Is it Game Boy Advance?

136
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,960
Not a PSP?

137
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,500
Looks like a PSP to me.

138
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,920
The PSP is a GBA.

139
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,420
They have similar looks.

140
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,900
I think it's a PSP, you guys.

141
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,800
It has the buttons.

142
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,820
It has the little left and right trigger.

143
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,260
I think it's a PSP.

144
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,540
I don't think it's color accurate.

145
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,080
A GBA had those?

146
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,900
I didn't have one.

147
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,900
I didn't have a GBA.

148
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,660
Talking about the one on the bed or the cabinet?

149
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,580
The one on the cabinet.

150
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,660
The one on the bed is definitely a Game Boy.

151
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,380
Oh, I didn't even notice that.

152
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,960
We're like psychoanalyzing this room.

153
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,940
We're like...

154
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,780
What do you got in there, Daisy?

155
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,740
What do you got in there?

156
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,840
It's a little boomer.

157
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,660
That's OK though.

158
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,660
We welcome hags here.

159
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,800
Right?

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,480
Oh.

161
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,620
She's a lion, right?

162
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,880
Oh my goodness.

163
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,220
Oh no, it's the...

164
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,360
It's the Teletubbies baby, but it's a cat?

165
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,100
Oh my god.

166
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,880
Teletubbies.

167
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,480
We're going into the sun.

168
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,620
It's Outer Wilds.

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,320
This is so cute.

170
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,260
Oh my gosh, wait, they're little Teletubbies.

171
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,940
This is so cute.

172
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Oh

173
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:51,120
no, I think they're getting a little crazy.

174
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,200
Crazy.

175
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,170
Oh!

176
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,410
Idle Girl Advance.

177
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,050
It is a Game Boy.

178
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,910
You guys are right.

179
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,270
You guys were right.

180
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,390
I was wrong.

181
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,550
I admit defeat.

182
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,050
RIP to the PSP.

183
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,550
Who had a PSP anyway?

184
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,530
What's up with the shell?

185
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,170
Cute!

186
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,370
PSP was great.

187
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,090
It's nobody had the Vita.

188
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,060
Daisies in the trap, baby!

189
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,260
She's pollinating us, you guys.

190
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,420
Gotta

191
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,520
grow a daisy!

192
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,400
I got a package, alright.

193
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,720
Grow a daisy.

194
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,060
Oh my gosh, we're burying her alive.

195
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,030
She's a hungry flower.

196
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,080
What's this accent?

197
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:02,880
Water?

198
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,280
Water?

199
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,620
The chat!

200
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,780
Oh there it is!

201
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,380
There's the water!

202
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,060
There's the water!

203
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,360
Oh!

204
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,040
Oh my God.

205
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,590
Metal Gear.

206
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:47,810
Oh

207
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,500
my God.

208
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,180
She's evolving.

209
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,200
Insane in the membrane.

210
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,280
Don't go in the chat and say Metal Gear.

211
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,140
I see you guys.

212
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,140
Where is the Metal Gear?

213
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,280
Because...

214
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,240
The exclamation point.

215
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,500
Oh!

216
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,740
What is happening?

217
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,720
Oh she's growing!

218
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,540
I was like what is happening?

219
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,720
What is happening?

220
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,040
Oh she can't stop growing.

221
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,560
A giantess VTuber maybe.

222
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,330
Oh my gosh, even the Katamari music.

223
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,220
The gentle people.

224
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,260
Oh,

225
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,080
what is that?

226
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,020
Is that the mascot?

227
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,360
Is that her mascot character?

228
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,480
Popeye laugh.

229
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,220
Oh the glasses!

230
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,520
So cute!

231
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,460
Oh it fits her so well.

232
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,020
I can't tell if that's part of her stream or if it's buffering a little.

233
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,140
Her butt.

234
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,960
The butthole!

235
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,440
No, don't get the pants!

236
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,980
It's so cute.

237
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,400
I love X buttholes.

238
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,970
So she's a plant and a lion?

239
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,870
Does she eat water or meat?

240
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,690
What about the water in the meat?

241
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,710
X butt.

242
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:21,310
Yeah!

243
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,430
The X butthole.

244
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,730
Oh, what's going on?

245
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,760
What

246
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,560
are foot fumes?

247
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,070
We love a criminal.

248
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,330
Oh my gosh, wait, I just noticed she has the Koharu like...

249
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,870
Striped down her middle.

250
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,930
Oh my gosh.

251
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,260
Oh my gosh, we're already going to her place.

252
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,280
The first and the last.

253
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,400
Last time.

254
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,540
This animator.

255
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,960
Wait, what's wrong?

256
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,500
Wait, what happened?

257
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,740
I'm confused.

258
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,300
Why did she stop the lore video?

259
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,770
What was wrong with it?

260
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,230
I'm confused.

261
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,440
We don't need to see the rest.

262
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,040
Oh, mangaka.

263
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,960
She must not like lore.

264
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,220
I guess so.

265
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,240
The lore.

266
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,740
It's so important.

267
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,980
It's what makes a VTuber.

268
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,430
What?

269
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,180
Oh this...

270
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,700
Oh sexy!

271
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,660
What did the lion do?

272
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,760
The certificate...

273
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,360
Certificate...

274
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,180
Of awesome.

275
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,540
Maskos.

276
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,720
The lion is king of the jungle.

277
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,100
No!

278
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,260
Stole my certificate?

279
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,420
I never had a certificate of awesome.

280
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,400
Maybe I should work for that.

281
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,600
Maybe I should go back to school for a certificate of awesome.

282
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,990
I like her art so much.

283
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,610
It's so cute.

284
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,250
It's so silly.

285
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:47,960
Oops!

286
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,520
Clap everybody!

287
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,070
We clap!

288
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,490
We clap!

289
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,390
Yeah, there you go guys.

290
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,130
Good job, good job.

291
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,650
The wares.

292
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:15,670
The wares.

293
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,590
There is the certificate.

294
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,560
So cute!

295
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,820
OK, now we can see what stuff she is into.

296
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,040
She is not a liar.

297
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,020
She is a lion.

298
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,000
That Hamtaro game.

299
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,520
It's the only game one of my friends has ever played, ever.

300
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,860
Literally just that Hamtaro game.

301
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,840
That is the only game she has ever played.

302
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,860
Picross!

303
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,900
Oh my gosh.

304
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,280
Wait, Picross 3D though.

305
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,460
Oh my gosh.

306
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,120
Energy.

307
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,720
The background is so cute.

308
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,520
Oh my gosh.

309
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,880
Toys.

310
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,120
30M.

311
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,140
So true.

312
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,420
Internet safety everybody.

313
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,260
30 million.

314
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,680
She is mighty young.

315
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,420
Oh my gosh.

316
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,540
Wait, I'm going to start.

317
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,260
Wait, I can say that too.

318
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,200
I'm forever 19...wait.

319
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,860
Forever...why did I just say I'm forever 19?

320
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,700
I mean it's true.

321
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,180
Forever 90?

322
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,080
No!

323
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,360
I never said...I said 19!

324
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,740
Forever 19.

325
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,840
Oh cute!

326
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,590
A dandelion.

327
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,640
I want

328
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,700

329
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,100

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,300
Does it...I just want to shake it and make...like start drawing on it, you know?

331
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,660
Hello?

332
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,400
Hello?

333
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,180
Hello?

334
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,000
Hello?

335
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,640
Hello?

336
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,460
Hello?

337
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,910
Forever 9 team.

338
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,570
What do you mean 9?

339
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,850
Who do you mean team?

340
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,690
It's so cute!

341
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,070
Oh my gosh, what a fun interface!

342
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,110
Oh my gosh.

343
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,160
Oh my gosh, no.

344
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,300
Cute!

345
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,420
Oh my gosh, it's so cute!

346
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,110
It's so cute!

347
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,100
And the sound effects and everything.

348
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:57,960
Oh my gosh.

349
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,030
Orange cat.

350
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,930
Standing cat is actually...

351
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,770
She loves growing until it's too much.

352
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,600
Cute!

353
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,900
Daisy OS.

354
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,060
Cute!

355
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,660
Oh no!

356
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,300
Oh no!

357
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,140
The virus!

358
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,560
Yes, I do!

359
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,980
Yes, I do.

360
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,760
Yes.

361
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,540
It can only pick one thing.

362
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,070
Oh my gosh, cute!

363
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,880
Oh my gosh, so cute!

364
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,420
She put so much effort into this, wow.

365
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,180
Daisy...the live...oh wow!

366
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,810
Yeah, I need my grandma glasses on.

367
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,130
Guys?

368
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,260
Wait, is it actually working?

369
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,060
Oh my gosh.

370
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,700
It reminds me...oh my gosh.

371
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,260
Oh my gosh.

372
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,480
Cute!

373
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:34,720
Cute!

374
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,960
King of the hill.

375
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,280
Real MySpace vibes.

376
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,520
It's like...the site is like pre-Tumblr, I feel.

377
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,050
It's so cute!

378
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,250
There's more!

379
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,040
Wait, what is this?

380
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,370
Oh my gosh, Minecraft B.

381
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,270
What's so cute?

382
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,230
Wait, what is this?

383
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,530
What is Rubes XYZ?

384
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,530
I've never heard of this before.

385
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,210
There's a guestbook!

386
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,690
Oh my gosh, so cute!

387
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,010
That's so cool.

388
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,990
Oh my gosh.

389
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,240
She prepared so much, for real.

390
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,460
Snoopy!

391
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,580
Snoopy!

392
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,220
Oh my gosh, I love Snoopy.

393
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,350
They're whispering.

394
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,350
I can't understand their language.

395
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,050
Fandy Lion?

396
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,650
Oh my gosh, that was so cute.

397
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,190
I love it.

398
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,190
Oh.

399
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,570
Wait a second.

400
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,250
Guys?

401
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,050
I recognize...guys?

402
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,610
Dismute?

403
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,290
No way.

404
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,650
You guys, no way, it's the music.

405
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,530
You guys, no way!

406
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,320
No way.

407
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,500
No way, it's my music.

408
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:41,660
It's my music.

409
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,560
I say it's the music I used before.

410
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,400
No way!

411
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,830
I'll take the nugs.

412
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,490
Let's go!

413
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,410
These look legit, I think.

414
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,090
These are legit.

415
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,680
Who

416
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,660
is bootlegging the Iron Giant?

417
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,660
No!

418
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,420
It's too sad.

419
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,380
Don't bootleg the Iron Giant.

420
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:58,880
No!

421
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,960
At least pay for that one.

422
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,710
Wait, what's the code?

423
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,130
Cute!

424
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,590
Cute!

425
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,250
I'm hungry.

426
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,450
The fancy stuff.

427
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,550
The good stuff.

428
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,710
Yeah.

429
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,940
Okay.

430
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,460
Yeah, it makes sense.

431
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,200
There is no scuff here.

432
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,760
Stop!

433
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,860
Stop!

434
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
No, I'm not yucking it.

435
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,200
I'm yumming it.

436
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,500
Oh my gosh, this stuff was my favorite ever!

437
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,180
I used to eat the Kids Cuisine so much!

438
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,920
Oh my gosh.

439
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,440
I always loved the mac and cheese because it was just basically flavorless.

440
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,240
And then the brownie was like perfection.

441
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,940
Oh my gosh!

442
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,400
Everything in the box tasted the same.

443
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,920
It was so good though!

444
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,860
The worst was when the corn ended up in the brownie and it was just like a little soggy.

445
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,580
It made the brownie soggy.

446
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,740
It was kind of gross.

447
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,940
No, it was so good though.

448
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,780
Oh, we're dancing?

449
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,880
We're dancing?

450
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,940
We're dancing while we wait for...

451
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,320
our food to be done.

452
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,000
TV dinner.

453
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,020
Oh, we're dancing too?

454
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,060
What?

455
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,140
No, wait.

456
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,180
You put it in with the box.

457
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,780
Okay.

458
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,080
Cute!

459
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,560
This is hot.

460
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,020
Wait, where did the brownie go?

461
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,600
Oh wait, no.

462
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,020
The brownie was not my favorite.

463
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,880
It was the pudding!

464
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,480
It was the pudding that was my favorite.

465
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,900
But I never had mashed potatoes.

466
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,180
The pudding was so good!

467
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,620
It wasn't the brownie.

468
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,440
It was the pudding.

469
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,200
What is in there?

470
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,500
Sasuga flower.

471
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,120
Cute!

472
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,280
It's true.

473
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,600
Yeah.

474
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,560
No, the pudding one is the... The pudding one, especially when it gets that little...

475
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,640
It gets that like film on top of it.

476
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,150
In her what?

477
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,670
Everything in her what?

478
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,860
In her lions.

479
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:10,760
Okay, okay.

480
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,070
A what?

481
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,050
It's okay.

482
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,810
I don't know anything about beer either.

483
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,490
The number one.

484
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,890
It's a big deal.

485
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,810
It's a big deal guys.

486
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,490
Herb?

487
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,150
Her?

488
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,540
Here?

489
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,460
Herb?

490
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,640
Which is it?

491
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,590
She hates you?

492
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,470
No!

493
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,730
Herbivore?

494
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,390
Wait, herbicide?

495
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,450
Herbicide!

496
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:19,850
Oh no Herbicide!

497
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,400
No!

498
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,640
Aren't daisies not...Dandelions aren't weeds either, right?

499
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,220
Technically, but I guess some people call them weeds.

500
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,970
Let's go to war against the herbicide.

501
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,450
What?

502
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,670
Herbicide?

503
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,230
Herbicide?

504
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,790
Herbicide.

505
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:04,050
Which is it?

506
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,510
Herbicide.

507
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,790
Dandelions are weeds?

508
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,310
They are.

509
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,210
Bluey?

510
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:20,390
Bluey?

511
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,180
Wait, is Bluey actually that good?

512
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,180
Futurama?

513
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,300
What was the cat?

514
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,260
Oh, the chi of the cat.

515
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:42,920
Silly!

516
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,000
Blue ads!

517
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,340
Wait, this is...my whole stream right now is an ad.

518
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,640
Oh that was Powerpuff Girls, I think.

519
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:08,680
What?

520
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,540
Beavis and Byhen?

521
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,260
Bluey...Lion Girl!

522
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,630
This face!

523
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,430
A

524
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,130
freak?

525
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,010
What's wrong with being a freak?

526
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,710
Oh cute!

527
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,580
What is this?

528
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,400
This picture?

529
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:44,720
Oh no.

530
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,380
It's her as a baby.

531
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,680
It's so cute!

532
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,770
You guys, I think it looks like her.

533
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,070
Oh my God, the eye color is even the same.

534
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,690
The eye color is even the same.

535
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:21,970
Oh...

536
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,020
She is so cute!

537
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,900
Oh my gosh.

538
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,550
Yeah!

539
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,710
I don't want to touch the grass though.

540
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:54,530
No!

541
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,760
Wait, I thought that was the herbicide coming in for the total herbicide war.

542
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,930
What's the middle one?

543
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,250
Oh my gosh, so cute.

544
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,590
What is...Oh I just noticed the lace on her neck.

545
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,730
Oh my gosh, so pretty.

546
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,590
Oh my gosh, so cute!

547
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,570
Yeah, Ralph is really cute.

548
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:02,550
Stop!

549
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,530
Oh my gosh!

550
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:11,110
Oh my gosh, stop!

551
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,910
The Teheran is so cute!

552
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:17,130
Oh...

553
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,000
I want to see her full outfit.

554
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,100
I love her hair too.

555
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,740
Oh my gosh, the head.

556
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,540
The chibi mode is so cute.

557
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,780
Who is doing that?

558
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,840
Who is grabbing the stop grow?

559
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,740
What's something cool?

560
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,260
Oh my gosh, a magic trick.

561
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,040
A magic trick.

562
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,260
Why?

563
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,100
Why are we in the sky?

564
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:27,900
What's happening?

565
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,080
Wait, actually?

566
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,440
What is happening?

567
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,410
Wait, is it...

568
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:52,490
Yeah.

569
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,630
Oh, ok, just kidding.

570
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,820
Ok, it's live baby!

571
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,600
It's live baby!

572
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,380
I'm ready.

573
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,330
I thought he was going to come out of nowhere.

574
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,440
You got this!

575
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,280
You got this Daisy!

576
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:55,440
Daisy!

577
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,040
I

578
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:06,940
want one too.

579
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,800
Oh my gosh.

580
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,040
The stylophone.

581
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,940
I'm into collecting weird instruments.

582
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,210
What's bread?

583
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,350
Oh,

584
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,400
how many rooms does she have?

585
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,320
Oh my gosh, we are being teleported to a different place every...

586
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,820
This is a big house.

587
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:26,350
We'll be raiding her next, so...

588
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:38,830
Cute.

589
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,020
A tree for us!

590
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,580
Oh?

591
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,580
A phandelion.

592
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,610
Oh my gosh, a christening.

593
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,610
Oh, cute!

594
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,970
Oh my gosh, so cute!

595
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,980
So cute!

596
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,840
Oh my gosh.

597
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:51,340
Oh,

598
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:14,500
it's also early.

599
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,540
3PM EST.

600
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:15,820
Let's see.

601
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,200
Oh my

602
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,930
gosh, so cute!

603
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,750
So Circe will be raiding... Oh gosh.

604
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:57,970
I guess we'll be raiding right into her...

605
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:00,150
I think it started already, so...

606
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,610
Thank you guys for watching the debut with me!

607
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,770
We'll be raiding into Circe.

608
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:09,450
I know she's a ghost, but always remember who your number one ghost is.

609
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:13,590
Well, maybe she'll be your number one ghost pirate, but I'm your number one ghost maid.

610
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:14,130
OK!

611
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,550
Thank you guys for watching with me!

612
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:18,910
See you guys later!

613
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:25,740
Bye bye!
