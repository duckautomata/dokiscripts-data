1
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,900
I was muted.

2
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,260
I was muted.

3
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:55,900
Hello everybody, welcome to...

4
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,180
I forgot my bunny ears!

5
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,220
Set up everything else.

6
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,760
One second.

7
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,160
One second.

8
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,680
One second.

9
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,680
I forgot the most important thing!

10
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't believe it.

11
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,120
I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it.

12
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,020
I cannot believe it.

13
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,960
Wait, they're kinda big, aren't they?

14
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,780
That's a bit better.

15
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,560
Maybe.

16
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,660
Maybe, maybe.

17
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,400
That's a bit better.

18
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,040
Maybe.

19
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,460
Do they look even?

20
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,360
Thank you!

21
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,420
I like mates and bunny girls.

22
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,060
Really?

23
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,960
Rascal does not dream of a maid bunny girl.

24
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,300
Okay!

25
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,160
Now we're ready!

26
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,360
That's why I love Toki.

27
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,360
She is a maid, and also a bunny girl.

28
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:00,820
You're so right.

29
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,780
One of them looks big.

30
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,500
It's only when I look certain ways, one looks bigger than the other.

31
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,140
I fell asleep before the end of the collab last night.

32
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,780
But you did great for your first hell dive.

33
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,640
Thank you!

34
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,260
Hopefully the devs fixed that glitch that kept saying you were killed by an innocent kettle.

35
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,660
I don't know what was going on.

36
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,620
So crazy, right?

37
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:17,820
Thank you!

38
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,760
Chuu!

39
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,640
Chuu!

40
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,900
And drink those things with the five gifted!

41
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,300
Put on the bunny ears mint.

42
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,980
We got a bunny garden to venture to.

43
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,580
If you don't have bunny ears on, it scares them away, you know?

44
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,680
It's a fact.

45
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,220
It's a real fact.

46
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,060
Hold on, I am gonna make myself a wee bit like that.

47
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,900
There we go.

48
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,590
This is a different Bustin' than usual, huh?

49
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,610
Also, welcome back, Minto!

50
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,870
Thank you, NapNap!

51
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,250
What do you mean by that?

52
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,570
It's always the same kind of Bustin'.

53
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,170
Love the collab last night.

54
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,950
Thank you!

55
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,110
So...

56
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,550
I am a big fan of curate games.

57
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,590
They always just appeal to me in the best ways.

58
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,570
Also, can you guys see my...

59
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,330
My eye?

60
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,250
Tracker?

61
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,190
Can you...

62
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,330
Is it on?

63
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,310
Can you see it?

64
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,030
We can see it?

65
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,550
I tried to make it not so...

66
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,390
Invasive.

67
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,330
I tried to make it like a little bit more...

68
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,470
A little bit...

69
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,410
What's the word?

70
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,710
A little less obvious.

71
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,170
Subtle!

72
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:40,690
Subtle!

73
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,110
Subtle!

74
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,070
It's a bit hard to see.

75
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,450
Oh wait, actually...

76
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,710
I didn't want it to like...

77
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,450
Um...

78
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,030
I didn't want it to like...

79
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,370
Get too in the way, you know?

80
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,570
But also...

81
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,530
I changed the opacity on it...

82
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,970
When I set it up earlier...

83
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,490
And now I don't know how to change it.

84
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:03,590
But...

85
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,150
We'll see...

86
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,250
Yeah, it's a little less distracting.

87
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,850
Let's see how it is in the game.

88
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,010
It might be easier to see there.

89
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,110
Um...

90
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,210
Yeah, of course we can't have it get in the way of the guns.

91
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,670
That'd be ridiculous.

92
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,030
Okie dokie.

93
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,450
Um...

94
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,270
So yeah!

95
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,210
This game...

96
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,110
Like I said...

97
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,710
I'm a fan of Kirite games.

98
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,590
Um...

99
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,550
This one is very much like Dream City Club.

100
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,290
So my...

101
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,650
Neurons were especially...

102
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,350
Um...

103
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,330
Perked?

104
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,830
My neurons were especially activated.

105
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,270
Um...

106
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,190
As for the girls...

107
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,610
Can you see my mouse?

108
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,850
Yeah.

109
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,630
As for the girls...

110
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,630
I'm thinking...

111
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,250
The...

112
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,650
The side pony girl looks like...

113
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,650
She's catching my interest the most.

114
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,250
Just...

115
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,770
But usually I like inner color.

116
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,810
Um...

117
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,210
But she's kind of like Gyaru-esque.

118
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,230
So...

119
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,890
I'm kind of a fan.

120
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,870
So...

121
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,010
She's sassy!

122
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:10,910
I'm like...

123
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,190
I mean her skirt...

124
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,470
Sorry I'm kind of blocking it.

125
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,510
Everything?

126
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:16,770
Um...

127
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,510
I don't know what their names are.

128
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,290
That's the one thing about being like a streamer.

129
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,050
Is...

130
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,730
Wanting to watch something.

131
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,850
But also being like...

132
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,270
No I can't watch it because...

133
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,570
I have to be the one...

134
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:28,930
Like...

135
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,670
I wanna have a raw reaction when I stream it.

136
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,510
You know?

137
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:32,870
So...

138
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,290
Um...

139
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,150
They're all good.

140
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,910
Short haired tomboy is peak for me.

141
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,770
She's very cute.

142
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,430
And she's got kind of like a Hime cut.

143
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,210
Going on a little bit.

144
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,250
But I like the pink...

145
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,770
The blonde to pink fade.

146
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,150
I'm a big fan of that.

147
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:50,990
Um...

148
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,850
Middle girl is cute.

149
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,730
She's just kind of...

150
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,990
She's kind of plain.

151
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,850
So it's like...

152
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,790
You know...

153
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,970
Not my type.

154
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,090
Exactly.

155
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:01,890
Um...

156
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,850
Middle girl is cute.

157
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,690
Middle one has default thigh highs.

158
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,510
Are they thigh highs?

159
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,170
Or are they...

160
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,330
Tights?

161
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,270
Oh wait.

162
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,750
Maybe...

163
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,330
That is a sliver...

164
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,290
Maybe that is a sliver of...

165
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,370
Thigh.

166
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,270
Right there.

167
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,610
Looks like tights to me.

168
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,170
No I think that's a sliver of thigh.

169
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,290
Right there.

170
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,300
Anyway...

171
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,640
The booba variety is lacking.

172
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,660
Yeah!

173
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,760
I mean she's definitely the biggest.

174
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,040
Um...

175
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,860
It might...

176
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,620
It might have been nicer maybe to get some petan girls or something.

177
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,680
But that's okay.

178
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,660
What's under extra?

179
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,480
I'm keep wondering.

180
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,040
Event CG...

181
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,770
This building?

182
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,590
It is...

183
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,350
Thank you!

184
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,550
Thank you!

185
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,650
This building I'm pretty sure is where the chubby girl maid cafe is.

186
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,130
There was some other ones in there.

187
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:27,750
Hmm?

188
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,230
Hmm?

189
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,770
Does this take place in Akiba?

190
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,530
Does this take place in Akiba?

191
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,390
I'm scanning the stream...

192
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,790
unsure...

193
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,410
Fuckiba?

194
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,570
Don't call it that!

195
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,630
Tutorial?

196
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,930
For what?

197
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,750
Event CG?

198
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,070
CD, album, and mystery.

199
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,310
Mystery!

200
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,700
Alright, let's start.

201
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,740
Let's start!

202
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,580
What am I doing?

203
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
Me starting this game?

204
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,120
I'm pretty sure.

205
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,370
That's so funny.

206
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,350
Why did I make such a big mistake?

207
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,550
I would never do something like that normally.

208
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,570
My company fired me!

209
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,330
The bunny maid girl in the lower left is the best IMA job?

210
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,830
Stop it!

211
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,310
Stop it!

212
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,290
I'm not even a bunny most of the time.

213
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,530
It is what it is.

214
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,110
It's not the first time it's happened.

215
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,890
Oh wait, sorry.

216
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,090
I forgot to read your thing, Rico.

217
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,810
I think I reacted but I forgot to read it.

218
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,510
Since my cat decided that he needs to be on my team, he's on my lap right now.

219
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,850
How are things going with the quest to get Butaro a friend?

220
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,570
Oh yeah, Butaro.

221
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,320
I got him a friend.

222
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,360
I

223
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,620
got my cat a friend!

224
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,220
Actually, I've been trying to like...

225
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,660
I've been not wanting to say so much because...

226
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,980
I didn't want to say anything until they were adjusted entirely.

227
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,020
They're still getting to know each other.

228
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,840
But...

229
00:12:59,620 --> 00:12:59,980
But...

230
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,100
Because, you know, if they were like...

231
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:10,840
If there was like something really, really wrong and they like couldn't get along at all, I wanted, you know, then I might have to like take her back and I didn't want to be like, I got a friend!

232
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,900
And then I have to give her back to the shelter or anything.

233
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,200
So...

234
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,260
But she's very, very sweet.

235
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,680
She's very, very cute.

236
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,800
I'll talk more about her later though.

237
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,760
Yeah, yeah.

238
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,380
I'm thankful they hired me in the first place.

239
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,020
I have nothing but gratitude for the company.

240
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,800
My boss even cried for me when they fired me.

241
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,960
He said, I'm sorry, I couldn't help you out.

242
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,800
They told me that this company wasn't the right fit for me and that there are other places where I could shine.

243
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,080
It was nice of them to say that.

244
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,720
Is there really somewhere out there?

245
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,400
Some place that would take in a fool like me?

246
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,680
Am I Hito?

247
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,240
Am I Hito for real?

248
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,260
Even if I could get another job somewhere else, I would just mess everything up for the people there.

249
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,940
She's got a fetish for fine art.

250
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,960
A pair of thigh highs.

251
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,500
An oversized sweatshirt.

252
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,520
What do you mean?

253
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,100
Even if I could just get...

254
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,340
Oh yeah.

255
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,260
I would mess everything up for the people there.

256
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,820
Maybe my life is done for.

257
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,540
Maybe my afterlife is done for.

258
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,520
I didn't even think it had started.

259
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,300
You want to play this too eventually so I can't watch the stream?

260
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,100
Oh!

261
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,700
Well, let me know what you think when you play it.

262
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,960
On a scale of 0 to Stinky House...

263
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,280
No, she's perfect.

264
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,100
She's not stinky at all.

265
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,600
She's so cute.

266
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,160
She's so cute.

267
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,600
Oh my god.

268
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,060
Mm-hmm.

269
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,200
She's my little princess.

270
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,860
Time to drink my problems away.

271
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,200
Pretty sure there's a bar somewhere in this building.

272
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,180
I like the little open sign.

273
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,080
Oh wow.

274
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,700
We don't have that much money.

275
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,220
Okay.

276
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,360
Oh, she's actually so cute.

277
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:13,740
Wait.

278
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,940
I'm sorry?

279
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,920
Do you guys want me to read?

280
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,840
Um...

281
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,680
What she says too?

282
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,400
I guess it might be easier, right?

283
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,980
Just throwing out a guess here.

284
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,360
But did something bad happen to you?

285
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,300
That's why you're trying to drink and forget everything?

286
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:38,540
Or...

287
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,760
Are you trying to get me to go to your hostess club?

288
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,300
No, I'm not.

289
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,040
I just happened to see you before you came to work.

290
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,080
So I was curious.

291
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,100
You're wrong.

292
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,840
You just happened to catch my eye before I got to work.

293
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,700
Caught my eye?

294
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,400
She looks like a little country bumpkin.

295
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,520
She's got like this plaid like ascot on.

296
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,200
And like her jean skirt.

297
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,460
It's just...

298
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,320
You look so tired.

299
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,480
As if your afterlife...

300
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,620
Sorry.

301
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Your life is over.

302
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,060
Eyes up, girl.

303
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,640
My eyes are up here.

304
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,760
My eyes are up here.

305
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,120
I think it's a little off.

306
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,700
But that's okay.

307
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,840
You might be right.

308
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,280
Oh, yay!

309
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,200
You are...

310
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,500
Oh my gosh.

311
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,500
She's like, I knew it.

312
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,380
Yes.

313
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,000
Your life is...

314
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,400
Oh my gosh.

315
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,320
You just wanna throw yourself off Monte Bashi bridge right now.

316
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,200
I get it.

317
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,600
Oh my gosh.

318
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,460
I'm so...

319
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:47,700
I'm so sorry.

320
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,700
I'm so glad that I was right.

321
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,580
That you are so down on your luck and such a sad, sad, pathetic soul right now.

322
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:54,960
Yeah.

323
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,100
You should apologize.

324
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,800
Oh.

325
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,160
Sorry.

326
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
This isn't something to be happy about.

327
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,880
Sorry.

328
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,800
Really.

329
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,480
Sorry.

330
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,640
Hi.

331
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,380
That's all.

332
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,100
Hello.

333
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,780
Thank you.

334
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,580
I shouldn't have hit it right on the bullseye.

335
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm sorry.

336
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,520
It's so sad to think your life is over.

337
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,400
Yeah.

338
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,840
I know.

339
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,920
What should I do?

340
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,400
If I invite him in, I'll really become a...

341
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,180
A tout?

342
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,500
A tout?

343
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:36,940
Tout?

344
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,220
Sorry.

345
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,120
Oh.

346
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,320
I forgot that when I...

347
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,580
Get out of the game...

348
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,440
But...

349
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,460
I'm so hurt.

350
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:47,660
I'm so sorry.

351
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,020
A tout?

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,440
I can't let you go.

353
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,720
Profit!

354
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,520
Thank you for the vibe.

355
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,320
Thank you.

356
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,380
I can't leave someone so hurt out in the cold.

357
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,580
A solicitor.

358
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:57,920
Oh.

359
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,900
I'll be a tout.

360
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,580
Hold on.

361
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,740
Well, it's, I think, a bit more accurate now, maybe.

362
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,960
No, not really.

363
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,520
But that's okay.

364
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,920
What do you mean?

365
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:10,980
That's right.

366
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,960
You don't have to come to the store today.

367
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,440
It's a type of fish.

368
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,100
Just to have a look inside.

369
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,380
Yeah.

370
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,780
It's like a salesperson.

371
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,000
Ah.

372
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,040
Got it.

373
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,300
You don't have to come into the shop.

374
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,460
You can just have a sneak peek.

375
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,300
That's right.

376
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,660
I don't know what's going on.

377
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
The truth is, I work here.

378
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,140
I didn't know they opened this kind of bar here.

379
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,080
It's some place where I can drink with girls.

380
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,840
So, when I was in Japan, for the two months that I was there...

381
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,640
Actually, by the way...

382
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,480
I was there by my train station.

383
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,060
Every time I would get home, there would be...

384
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,240
There was a bunny girl bar.

385
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,860
And it was kind of cold out.

386
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,880
So, the girl...

387
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,680
So, I couldn't, like, see them in the bunny girl outfits.

388
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,520
But they had, like, giant coats on.

389
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,760
And then the bunny ears.

390
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,600
I think it made it sexier.

391
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,360
Because I couldn't see, like, anything underneath.

392
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,300
But, like, you know, I could see their legs.

393
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,220
And I could see the bunny ears.

394
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,520
And I just imagined, like, the suit underneath.

395
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,420
And I was like, wow.

396
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,960
This is so sexy.

397
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,000
Keep the jacket on, girl.

398
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,880
Keep it on.

399
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,590
So, I was like...

400
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,990
I got to see bunny girls almost every day.

401
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,730
It was so awesome.

402
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,870
The power of imagination.

403
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,750
It's some place I can drink with girls?

404
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,770
That's like any bar in Akiba, to be honest.

405
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,950
I've never been in a shop like this before.

406
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,770
It's clean.

407
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,470
And the girls are so cute.

408
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,430
I guess I'll give it a try.

409
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,550
Oh, you're going to get me in trouble, sir.

410
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,190
Wait, why?

411
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,970
I can't come in?

412
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,390
Oh my god, you tease.

413
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,510
That's all for today.

414
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,550
I'll give you just a glimpse.

415
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,750
If you come inside, then I'm really a tout.

416
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,070
So, if you're interested, I'll be waiting for you at the next shop.

417
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,250
I give you the right to come to the shop as a customer.

418
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,690
Whenever you're interested, I'll be waiting for you to come.

419
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,690
Haha, you're so sincere.

420
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,310
Life isn't over.

421
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:36,930
It's okay.

422
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,890
Your life isn't over.

423
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,010
You'll be okay.

424
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,690
I know you will.

425
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,510
Oh my gosh.

426
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,190
Because of bunny girls, bunny girls will save me.

427
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,570
This place actually looks so fancy.

428
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,430
Huh?

429
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,510
It's a little bit, but it's a good smile, isn't it?

430
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,470
That's why it's not over.

431
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,230
Right now?

432
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,570
Even if it was small?

433
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,270
Sorry.

434
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,230
I've been so sleepy today.

435
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,350
I know you smiled.

436
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,990
That means you're not done yet.

437
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,390
Arigato.

438
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,950
I'll be waiting for you at this shop.

439
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,710
I'll be waiting for the next chance to see you.

440
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,850
I'm looking forward to it.

441
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,810
She's so country.

442
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,330
Haha, y'all.

443
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,850
I'll be here at this shop waiting for you.

444
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,530
I'm looking forward to the next time we can see each other.

445
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,130
Alright.

446
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:27,950
I'll be waiting for you.

447
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,050
I'll be waiting for you.

448
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,770
What was her deal?

449
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:34,910
She was so strange.

450
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,090
She doesn't even know me.

451
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,650
It's interesting.

452
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,610
I like the 3D mix with the CD.

453
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,710
It's cool.

454
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,650
But I guess I do feel a little better.

455
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,170
I'm such a simple guy.

456
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,390
Me too, Haito.

457
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,490
I wish I could name myself.

458
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,470
Now I don't know if I really want to get drunk and forget everything.

459
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,750
I'm just gonna go home.

460
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,210
Oh my god.

461
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,210
Oh!

462
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,690
Wait, isn't that the Prison Princess Girls?

463
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,890
On the wall?

464
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,470
Also, when I saw that in a brief moment, I thought it was Fumoko.

465
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,530
I thought it was Fumoko.

466
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:22,850
Gorillas?

467
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,850
Is it sad that I recognized Prison Princess before Gorillas?

468
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,330
He's got his little iPad.

469
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,390
He's got his computer with sticky notes.

470
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,470
We're jobless now.

471
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,710
We are neat.

472
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,430
My life isn't over, huh?

473
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,890
More Japanese, please.

474
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,010
I'm in trouble.

475
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,710
I'm in trouble.

476
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,990
What color were her eyes mint?

477
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,200
Green?

478
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,210
Wait, were they actually?

479
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:21,370
Let's go.

480
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,610
No way.

481
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,930
Why would I take something a girl said to me seriously when I don't even know her name?

482
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:33,970
Also, when she works at a bar that relies on ensnaring men.

483
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,930
She didn't even seem to be joking around, but you know.

484
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,110
They were green?

485
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,790
Oh my gosh.

486
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,270
I was tossing between green and purple.

487
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,890
I mean, it's not like anyone has ever told me that my life is done.

488
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,990
I'm the only one who thinks that.

489
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,950
If I don't finish it myself, maybe it's still possible to start again.

490
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,830
Finish what?

491
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,510
Oh, hello?

492
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,570
I'm sorry for calling you without notice.

493
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,310
You know how you were saying work was busy and you needed help?

494
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,710
Do you still need help?

495
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,210
If you'd like, would you take me...

496
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,550
Oh, Q!

497
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,170
What was that?

498
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,470
Oh no, I'm skipping.

499
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,570
It's been a week since I started my new job.

500
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,750
What should I use my money on?

501
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:21,930
Wait, I still have the same amount.

502
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,890
I haven't gotten any more money.

503
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,010
How much is 1,500 yen to U.S.

504
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,170
dollars?

505
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,110
Curious question.

506
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,450
Well, back in the day, it probably would have been about 150 U.S.

507
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:34,630
dollars.

508
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:41,770
But with the yen being as bad as it is now, I'd say about 100 to 110 dollars.

509
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,170
Yeah, about 100 bucks.

510
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:46,690
Sheesh.

511
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:54,950
96?

512
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,230
No way.

513
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,530
I saw like when people were going to like from Japan.

514
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,490
I saw like they were flying to Hawaii.

515
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,150
They were bringing...

516
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,430
They were bringing their own things.

517
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,170
They were bringing their own food.

518
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,570
Because the conversion rate...

519
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,270
Like Hawaii is already very expensive.

520
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,650
But with the conversion rate, it would have been so much more.

521
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:24,150
So they were like bringing their own food to like eat in Hawaii.

522
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,030
That's so sad.

523
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,890
That's so bad.

524
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,630
Hawaii is notoriously expensive.

525
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,310
Yeah.

526
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,590
The conversion rate is so bad.

527
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,110
That being said, me being positive is all thanks to her.

528
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,510
Should I go to that chick's shop?

529
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,250
Yeah, let's go see that chick.

530
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,030
Oh.

531
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,390
This week's salary...

532
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,050
Wow.

533
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:50,630
Nice.

534
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,970
Payment is made every Saturday for your new job.

535
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,730
Spend it carefully.

536
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,550
Cha-ching.

537
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,670
Cha-ching.

538
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,030
Cha-ching.

539
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:00,750
Gambling.

540
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,670
Album.

541
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,430
Vacation.

542
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,130
Wait.

543
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,230
Wait, I'm sorry.

544
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,190
You can gift a vacation to a cast member?

545
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,530
Not me.

546
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,310
I don't go on vacation.

547
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,070
They go on vacation.

548
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,210
Shop.

549
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,890
Purchase gifts to give to the cast.

550
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,170
My schedule.

551
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,410
You can apply for dispatch.

552
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,010
It takes two days for dispatch.

553
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,230
Do we not have a job anymore?

554
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,270
You can gamble.

555
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,050
You can view the photo taken.

556
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,070
You can sleep and let the day pass.

557
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,290
You can also rest your overworked body.

558
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,810
Save and load.

559
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:37,970
Interesting.

560
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,090
Interesting.

561
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,670
MC is a simp.

562
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,330
I think it was this shop here.

563
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,010
I'm a bit nervous though.

564
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:51,550
Wow.

565
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,530
I'm nervous.

566
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,570
Wow.

567
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,310
Cute.

568
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:54,990
Ah.

569
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,950
The voice at that door.

570
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,390
Ah.

571
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:57,910
Cute.

572
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,230
There's a bunny girl.

573
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,150
Ah.

574
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,730
Cute.

575
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,150
Ah.

576
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,130
I'm nervous.

577
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,270
Vacation is fun.

578
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:06,990
Thank you.

579
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,830
Thank you.

580
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:09,970
Thank you.

581
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,650
I'm not scared.

582
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,350
Where is this?

583
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,270
Where is it?

584
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,030
Where?

585
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,210
Here.

586
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,250
Here.

587
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:21,770
Let's go.

588
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:22,770
OK.

589
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,030
Let's go.

590
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,530
Aaaahhhh.

591
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,550
Honey.

592
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:25,790
Oh my god.

593
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,370
Oh my, God, this is...

594
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,850
Oh...

595
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,150
Oh my, God.

596
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,350
Oh my, God, this is...

597
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,370
Sweet.

598
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:38,530
A....

599
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:38,750
basin...

600
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,170
Aрь?

601
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,950
Dilizon.

602
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,750
What did you see?

603
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,650
ViviCore, thank you for the five gifted!

604
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,630
Thank you!

605
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,530
The customer who looked tired, you came!

606
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,150
Oh, now we know her name.

607
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,750
I like the ribbon on her head.

608
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:00,910
That's right.

609
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,470
The customer who looked tired.

610
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,570
I'm here.

611
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,690
Which starter will Mint choose?

612
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,890
Yellow, red, or blue?

613
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:07,930
Blue!

614
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,790
That makes me happy!

615
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,930
I wouldn't know what simping is like, so this is a new experience for me.

616
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,110
Of course it is okay.

617
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,370
It's my birthday today!

618
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,070
Can I get a happy birthday?

619
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,450
Of course, Melty!

620
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,650
Happy birthday to you!

621
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,810
Happy birthday to you!

622
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,150
Happy birthday dear Melty!

623
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,430
Happy birthday to you!

624
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,150
Happy birthday PyongPyong!

625
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,570
Hearing Maid Mint say my name again after all this time.

626
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,750
Dang, I'm lucky that Detective Manga is...

627
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,510
Hey Conan!

628
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,230
Oh, I just realized my thing kinda goes on my face.

629
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,390
Oh, there we go.

630
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,210
That's right, I've never been here.

631
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,370
I'll give you a brief explanation on how it works.

632
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,190
Please.

633
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,050
I don't know anything, so this will help.

634
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,430
The name of the shop is Bunny Garden.

635
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,990
A fun place to drink.

636
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,150
That's all.

637
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,630
Hmm...

638
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,210
It seems like I should understand.

639
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,170
But I don't.

640
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,170
Oh, well...

641
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:44,990
You'll get used to it eventually.

642
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,890
So I hope you'll visit a lot of places.

643
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,270
Well, you'll gradually get used to it, so it's okay.

644
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,250
I'll be really happy if you come here lots of times.

645
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,350
I agree.

646
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,810
To do that, I have to work hard at my current job.

647
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,890
He's already simping.

648
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,970
Maybe he feels like...

649
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,510
He feels like he owes her, you know?

650
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,170
He's just like, you saved my life.

651
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,530
So I...

652
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,210
I have to... I owe you.

653
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,230
I owe you, you know?

654
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,630
I like her... I like her... smug face.

655
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,270
It's over for my guy.

656
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,850
Well, then I want to be able to give...

657
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,210
...

658
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,210
I want you to be able to do your best, so I hope I can give you lots of healing!

659
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,250
That makes sense.

660
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,250
I feel like I can work harder if I feel better.

661
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,630
It's decided.

662
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,630
I didn't hear your order.

663
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,590
This is the menu.

664
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,490
She's so cute.

665
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,550
I'm sorry for what I said about her being too plain before.

666
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,890
I'll have a drink.

667
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,650
I'll have a drink.

668
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,270
What drink did you want?

669
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,030
Customers must purchase a drink.

670
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,190
A pricier drink could increase your likability.

671
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,110
Let's see...

672
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,270
A Cassius orange.

673
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,790
Cassius liquor and specialty orange juice.

674
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,070
With a low alcohol percentage, it is popular among women.

675
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,090
Oh my gosh, the fanciest beer!

676
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,250
I've ever seen in my life!

677
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,210
Blueberry liquor.

678
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,630
I think I just got paid today, so...

679
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:43,490
This luxury champagne is rare and loved by celebrities!

680
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,610
It's very high in alcohol content, so be careful.

681
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,810
Lab Paris.

682
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,610
Highest quality grapes and aged for several years.

683
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,630
It's popular for its fresh and mature taste.

684
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,400
Oh...

685
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,440
I thought it said Mori Calliope.

686
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,160
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.

687
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,640
Coming right...

688
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:14,780
What?

689
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,560
Who is gin?

690
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,420
Shouldn't it...

691
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,980
Wait, isn't it spelled with a G instead of a J?

692
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,360
The green bunny girl saved my life.

693
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,640
What are you talking about?

694
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,380
Is it...

695
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,760
Is it...

696
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,380
Is it because it's, like, copyrighted?

697
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,060
Sake.

698
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,960
It's a bit dry, easy to drink.

699
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,300
A fine wine.

700
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,100
Vintage umeshu.

701
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,000
Bunny trap?

702
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,200
Infused with a sweet, gentle aroma, many people tend to drink too much of it.

703
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,200
Bunny punch!

704
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,780
Has a high alcohol content, but women seem to be fond of it.

705
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,040
Wait, I'm drinking this, right?

706
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,260
Or are they drinking it?

707
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,460
Maybe I'll try the bunny max.

708
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,660
Has a partic... strong parti...

709
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,160
Peculiarity is not for everyone.

710
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,400
Oh, fill you up with power when drunk.

711
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,880
Recovering from depression.

712
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:14,840
Parasocial.

713
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,280
What do you mean?

714
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,480
No!

715
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,460
I mean, yes, now you're recovering from depression.

716
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,260
Yippee!

717
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,480
So this is my order.

718
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:23,880
Okay.

719
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,860
Let's go for the trap, because I feel like we've been trapped...

720
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,680
Wait a second.

721
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,760
Choosing for me.

722
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,340
Choosing for her.

723
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,740
I just noticed on the side.

724
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,820
I got paid today.

725
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,660
Let's get ourselves a bunny trap.

726
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,560
And...

727
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,780
We can get her the bunny punch.

728
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,260
I want to drink something too.

729
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,980
I want to drink something too.

730
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,440
I want to drink something too.

731
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,040
You can treat the cast members to a drink.

732
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,760
Some drinks that are more preferred than others.

733
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,540
And some are easier to get drunk on.

734
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,860
If you don't treat them to drinks.

735
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,500
They will prioritize other customers.

736
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,440
Treat your cast member to a drink.

737
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,100
I won't buy.

738
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
They will just leave me alone?

739
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,720
You saved my life.

740
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,200
Bunny...

741
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,340
Punch!

742
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,760
It tastes great.

743
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,060
Wait.

744
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,680
I should probably prioritize the girl that I want to...

745
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,620
That I want to get with.

746
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:28,980
Right?

747
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,500
Before I...

748
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,600
Spend expensive drinks on her?

749
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,660
Uh oh.

750
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,640
I think I messed up.

751
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,740
You can talk to the cast.

752
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,460
Something might happen.

753
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,220
Wait.

754
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,840
What does that mean?

755
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,600
You can give a gift to each cast member.

756
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,200
Once a day.

757
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,420
Gifts can be purchased from home.

758
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,420
You can treat the cast members to food.

759
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,400
There may be a preference for different foods.

760
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,760
Yes.

761
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,140
I have no presents.

762
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,380
Let's just talk to her.

763
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,040
Let's get to know her.

764
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,120
I'm getting kind of nervous.

765
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,500
Why?

766
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,360
I'm using therapy and medication.

767
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,580
The player character is the one recovering from depression.

768
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,160
I caught it.

769
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,300
Keep taking your meds.

770
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,860
I need your meds.

771
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,060
Are you alright?

772
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,620
She doesn't seem feeling well.

773
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:33,800
My eyes...

774
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,200
My eyes are up there.

775
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,920
What do you mean?

776
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,700
Wow.

777
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,480
Look at her bunny ears.

778
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,420
This must be the first meeting.

779
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,580
I'm so excited, nervous, and...

780
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,860
I mean, it's going to be the first time I meet this next customer.

781
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,720
My heart feels like it's going to explode from how fast it's racing.

782
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,540
But.

783
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,160
No.

784
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:54,800
It's no good.

785
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,260
This is the place where you're healing your customers.

786
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,400
Well, what am I saying?

787
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,280
The purpose of this place is to keep people safe.

788
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:08,840
Oh!

789
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,880
Thank you!

790
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,120
I will look into it!

791
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,660
Thank you!

792
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,000
But yeah, we're relaxed.

793
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,380
We're relaxed.

794
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,600
If I'm in a state like this, I'm sure the customer is going to feel the same.

795
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,100
Come on now, you've got this!

796
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
She's like saying all of this to my face.

797
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,900
Don't ask what my job is.

798
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,480
Let's start off with the usual.

799
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,180
The first step in order to become friends!

800
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,960
You're the customer, so please, go right ahead with everything you've got.

801
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,480
The first step...

802
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,680
Oh, okay.

803
00:36:59,680 --> 00:36:59,880
Oh, okay.

804
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,020
What about a hug?

805
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,200
Oh, I'm cringing!

806
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,740
Oh, the toast is good.

807
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,420
The toast is good.

808
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,360
There are some things that affect likability.

809
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,680
Choose your words carefully.

810
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,140
Where's my hug?

811
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,800
Oh, come on, girl.

812
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,500
Come on, little bunny girl.

813
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,480
Where's my hug?

814
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,020
Come on, little bunny girl.

815
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,680
Let's do the toast.

816
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,480
Let's do the toast.

817
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,260
So, a toast or something?

818
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,020
Sounds good.

819
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,640
Sounds good.

820
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,020
I'm so excited to drink.

821
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,280
But...

822
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,640
After knowing each other's names...

823
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,240
She liked it.

824
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,660
Don't you think we can get along?

825
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,280
She liked it.

826
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,300
That's the spirit.

827
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,980
You seem eager to start drinking.

828
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,500
But don't you think sharing each other's names comes first?

829
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,680
I read your name tag.

830
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:53,740
Um...

831
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,740
Uh...

832
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,700
Wait, no.

833
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,960
Hold on.

834
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,000
Move your hands.

835
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,900
There we go.

836
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,200
Oh, she doesn't have a name tag.

837
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,820
Anime convention flashbacks.

838
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,860
I'd love to know more about you.

839
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,540
Right, my name is Mint Phantom.

840
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,700
Oh gosh, I'm so jealous of everyone named Haito right now.

841
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,380
I'm so jealous of everyone named Haito.

842
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,740
Wait, Minto?

843
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,400
Haito?

844
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,020
It's kinda close.

845
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,280
Right?

846
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,320
Y...

847
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,700
Y...

848
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,200
I need to keep looking at me like that.

849
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:48,560
!

850
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,260
H Ac Am Sh It

851
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,040
CR The faces are so cute.

852
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,220
I like actually how soft the features are.

853
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,620
Like, they look...

854
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,440
Um, like the... They just look really good.

855
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,500
I wanted to remember your name and face, you see?

856
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,940
So I was doing my best to store that into my head.

857
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,800
Yeah, they look so cute!

858
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,140
They're so cute.

859
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,280
But there's no need to worry.

860
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,120
I've matched your face to your name now.

861
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,780
My name is Kana.

862
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,680
It doesn't matter what you call me, but I don't want to forget your name.

863
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,940
It's my turn now.

864
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,040
My name is Kana.

865
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,760
I don't mind if you give me a nickname.

866
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,960
But I know... But I sure hope you remember me.

867
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,340
I'll give you a nickname, alright?

868
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,940
From this day on, you're Bitch-chan.

869
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,140
Alright, I'll do my best to match your name to your face then.

870
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,500
Bitch-chan... Bitch-chan... Bitch-chan...

871
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,160
Bitch-chan... Bitch-chan...

872
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,200
Have you guys ever seen...

873
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,800
Have you guys ever seen Diabolic Lovers?

874
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,620
Girl loves that.

875
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,180
That was his nickname for the girl.

876
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,840
Are you being mean?

877
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,320
No!

878
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,720
No!

879
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,140
I'm trying to riz her!

880
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,240
What are you talking about?

881
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,560
I watched the Otomei show and I know now!

882
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,740
I know!

883
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,960
Stop it!

884
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,060
You're making me all flustered!

885
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,180
I didn't know it felt this embarrassing to be stared at!

886
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,400
I guess I got a little smarter from this whole situation.

887
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,460
Oh my god.

888
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,740
I kinda grew one brain cell that day.

889
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,120
Don't change the genre on your own.

890
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,340
Sorry!

891
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,300
Tell me more about yourself, Haito-kun.

892
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,140
I messed up real bad at work recently.

893
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,200
And because of that, the boss fired me.

894
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,520
So I've been assisting a friend at his work ever since.

895
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:40,230
Hmm... that sounds rough.

896
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,350
If I were in the same position, I'd be so upset that I wouldn't even be able to eat.

897
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,610
I can only imagine it, but...

898
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,830
Is this what the kids call negging?

899
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,070
What's that mean?

900
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,850
What's negging?

901
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,130
If it's what the kids call, I don't know.

902
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:05,360
If I was in your shoes...

903
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,680
I probably wouldn't even be able to eat.

904
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,900
Though I'm sure words can't express just how awful you must feel.

905
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,300
Oh, gaslighting.

906
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,720
Negative... edging?

907
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,800
I got it!

908
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,820
Oh, egging!

909
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,040
I'm so sorry!

910
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,760
Oh my gosh.

911
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,120
Negging is pick-up lingo.

912
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,880
For treating women horribly and they claim it gets all the women.

913
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,560
Oh, that sounds like diabolic lovers for real.

914
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,380
I'm going to do my absolute best in order for you to get back on your feet.

915
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,280
Okay.

916
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,420
I need to get myself together.

917
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,140
It's hot in here.

918
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,320
Try to be... I am!

919
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:04,780
I am!

920
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,040
I am!

921
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,700
I'm trying to be nice!

922
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,780
I'm trying... I'm using lingo that I learned from a show that apparently was bad.

923
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:20,380
I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm doing... I bought her good... I bought her the good juice, okay?

924
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,660
That time you spend here will be with a constant smile, I can assure you that much.

925
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,740
I hope we get along, Haito-kun.

926
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,880
I hope we get along, Haito-kun.

927
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,100
I hope we get along, Haito-kun.

928
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm going to steal your soul until you turn into this black silhouette of yourself and you can never leave.

929
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,420
Haito-kun, what are you going to do with the alcohol?

930
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,180
I'm still okay, so if you don't mind...

931
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,440
Does that mean we go three times?

932
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,600
The one, two, three?

933
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,400
Haito-kun, should I get you more drinks?

934
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,340
I can keep going, but I'll only continue if you want to.

935
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,900
Ex... Oh, there's a fee?

936
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,020
Oh my god, this place is so...

937
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,480
Expensive!

938
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,320
And so real!

939
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,120
Oh my gosh.

940
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,880
Let's switch, yeah, yeah.

941
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,310
I thought you were going home already.

942
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:21,590
Oh gosh, I'm a sucker.

943
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,470
What drink did you want?

944
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,050
Wait, can I switch out?

945
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:29,070
Uh-oh.

946
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,170
Oh no, I'm stuck with her!

947
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:31,870
Uh-oh.

948
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,630
Dang.

949
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,050
Oh, I'm getting sucked dry.

950
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,550
Here, we'll go with the...

951
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,550
I'm gonna go with the sake and she'll get the blueberry liquor.

952
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,790
Can I have some too?

953
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:52,870
Oh wait, this is how I...

954
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,390
This is how I...

955
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,270
Switch.

956
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,430
A customer called me, so I better get going.

957
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,690
I was just cheapskating this guy.

958
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,490
I can't believe he's not buying me another drink.

959
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,410
I can't believe it.

960
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,410
Bye bye!

961
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,030
Who's gonna come over?

962
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:17,870
What's your name?

963
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:20,930
Hello.

964
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:21,770
Miyuka.

965
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:22,990
Nice to meet you.

966
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,050
Nice to meet you.

967
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:29,450
Introduce yourself?

968
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,030
Would you like to introduce yourself?

969
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,110
Oh, she's so cool.

970
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:34,710
She's cool, isn't she?

971
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,250
Oh yeah.

972
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,210
You may call me Haito Kanda.

973
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,850
Oh.

974
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,750
You don't have to be polite with me.

975
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,170
I see.

976
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,990
I mean, okay.

977
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,250
I'm Haito Kanda.

978
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,790
I help my friend for work.

979
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,610
You help your friends?

980
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:59,070
Yeah, I was working at a company up until recently, but I got messed up and fired.

981
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,590
I don't know if that's like the first thing you want to keep telling people, you know?

982
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,530
I don't know if like...

983
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,210
Hi, I'm Haito Kanda.

984
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:09,470
I got fired recently.

985
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:16,790
Fired.

986
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:20,510
Right.

987
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,790
Are you bad at holding a conversation?

988
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,050
Are you a person of few words?

989
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,450
Are you angry?

990
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,810
Are you mad that I lost my money?

991
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,750
I got fired with Riz.

992
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:38,870
I'm thinking this one.

993
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,250
Maybe this seems not very offensive.

994
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,230
Are you a person of few words?

995
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,310
Oh.

996
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:46,370
Oh.

997
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:51,050
I guess I don't speak much.

998
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,710
She doesn't even use an honorific.

999
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,730
She just calls me Haito straight up.

1000
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,670
She hates us, you guys.

1001
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:01,490
She hates us.

1002
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:02,470
Yeah?

1003
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,190
I'm sorry.

1004
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,190
I'm sorry.

1005
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:06,650
What does that mean?

1006
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,890
Because I'm like this, I can't have a good time with Haito.

1007
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,750
I can fix her.

1008
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:16,990
I'm sorry I'm like this.

1009
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,270
Maybe you won't be able to have a good time.

1010
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:20,690
It's okay.

1011
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,130
Who knows what will happen.

1012
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,290
We just met each other.

1013
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,110
I think it would be nice if we could just take things slow.

1014
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:27,950
No rush.

1015
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,970
We already started to get to know each other.

1016
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,650
Thank you.

1017
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,570
She's so cute.

1018
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,110
Thank you.

1019
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:37,430
Haito.

1020
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,150
You're so kind.

1021
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,650
You're a kind one, Haito.

1022
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:44,990
Do you want to drink alcohol?

1023
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,550
What are you going to do?

1024
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,510
Get something ready.

1025
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,750
She's so cute.

1026
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,610
Do you want some alcohol?

1027
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:55,130
What should I do?

1028
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,710
Is there anything I should prepare?

1029
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:58,910
Oh.

1030
00:47:59,110 --> 00:47:59,710
Extend?

1031
00:47:59,810 --> 00:47:59,950
Extend.

1032
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,930
Here.

1033
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,250
I want to drink something that is as good as my efforts.

1034
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:07,950
You want to drink something that is as good as my efforts?

1035
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,910
I want to drink something that is as good as my efforts.

1036
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:12,990
I want to drink something delicious.

1037
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:13,850
What is it?

1038
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,030
What drink did you want?

1039
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,250
Let's do the same thing that we did with Kana in the beginning.

1040
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,790
I got the bunny trap, and she got the...

1041
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,350
Wait, do I have enough money?

1042
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,490
9,000.

1043
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,370
Just to save...

1044
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:29,490
Wait.

1045
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,910
Wait, is there a table charge?

1046
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,810
Wait, is there only 2x... Wait, do I...

1047
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,710
So, would it be 9000 or 6000?

1048
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,290
Don't worry about it.

1049
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:50,470
Okay!

1050
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,770
I'm gonna have the bunny trap.

1051
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:57,350
Can I have a drink with you?

1052
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,490
Oh, our little Chibi is so cute.

1053
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,570
I'm gonna get you the bunny punch.

1054
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:09,960
I did it!

1055
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,020
I did it!

1056
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,340
I like this.

1057
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,100
I'll

1058
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:19,990
have it.

1059
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,410
Oh, I'll have it!

1060
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:21,990
Oh, cute!

1061
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,290
Cute, cute, cute, cute, cute!

1062
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,390
Oh, I think you just dumped it all over the ground.

1063
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,510
She took one sip and was like...

1064
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,870
Oh wait, no!

1065
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,070
They put their drinks under the barley!

1066
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:35,450
I like that!

1067
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:37,510
There's like a little shelf there.

1068
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:38,270
Oh, that's so cute!

1069
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,130
Do you want to talk about something?

1070
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:50,510
Is there anything you want to talk about?

1071
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:55,570
You think tomorrow will be...

1072
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:56,430
Oh yeah, the weather deck.

1073
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:56,770
Let's go.

1074
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,710
You think tomorrow will be sunny?

1075
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:59,270
I don't know.

1076
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:00,990
I have no idea.

1077
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,110
Shall we look up the weather forecast?

1078
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,570
Are you curious about the weather?

1079
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,810
Are you always curious about the weather?

1080
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:12,430
Not really.

1081
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,270
I'm just making small talk.

1082
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:17,570
Sorry.

1083
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:18,450
I made you worry.

1084
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:20,390
Sorry.

1085
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,990
I didn't mean anything by that.

1086
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,690
This is a business venture and Buddy's stonks are through the roof!

1087
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:29,370
Yeah!

1088
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,570
If you do go bankrupt, just get a loan.

1089
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,330
They will understand.

1090
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,310
Watching you play this on my birthday is certainly interesting.

1091
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,250
Xeno!

1092
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:37,270
Happy birthday!

1093
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:42,330
Happy birthday to you.

1094
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,170
Happy birthday to you.

1095
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:48,310
Happy birthday dear Xeno.

1096
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:53,810
Happy birthday to you.

1097
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,530
Happy birthday!

1098
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:01,410
I love blue women.

1099
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:02,970
Ah, so true.

1100
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,790
Gosh, she looks like one of my...

1101
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,790
She looks like an Oshii I had that graduated.

1102
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,150
I mean, except in...

1103
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,910
Maybe the... the... the... the...

1104
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:12,510
The one repop...

1105
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,070
But she...

1106
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,990
I can't stop seeing my Oshii.

1107
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,470
I'm always like this.

1108
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,010
Is that okay?

1109
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:27,290
This is who I am.

1110
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:28,250
All the time.

1111
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,430
Is that okay with you?

1112
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,270
It's alright with me.

1113
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,310
We're just starting to get to know each other.

1114
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:35,550
That's weird.

1115
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,190
You're a peculiar one.

1116
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,770
You laughed just now, didn't you?

1117
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,550
You have a cute smile.

1118
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:45,050
Thank you.

1119
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,170
Wolfhound, thanks for the 20 gift!

1120
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,370
It's getting late.

1121
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:51,850
I should go home soon.

1122
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,590
Oh!

1123
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,230
Um...

1124
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,450
So it is 9,000.

1125
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,370
Oh my god.

1126
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:13,630
If you can please the cast members in the shop, they will see you out in a good mood when you leave.

1127
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,510
We pleased them.

1128
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,090
We did a good job.

1129
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:22,450
Haito, who is sent off, is more motivated to work and earn a higher salary for one week.

1130
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:28,990
Higher motivation for work can lead to a raise and an increase in base salary.

1131
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,470
Thank you for today.

1132
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,010
See you later.

1133
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,090
Yes.

1134
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,110
Yes, yes, yes.

1135
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:37,690
I'll be back.

1136
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:38,450
Wow!

1137
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,010
Turtles, thank you for the Akatoro!

1138
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,350
I mean, Akatsuma!

1139
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,610
This should make up for part of the memberships I missed these past years.

1140
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:48,330
Also, my tickets to your karaoke bar.

1141
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,350
I can't stop listening to them.

1142
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:49,630
Stop!

1143
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,150
Thank you so much!

1144
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:52,590
Thank you!

1145
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,050
There was no ticket.

1146
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,250
What are you talking about?

1147
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:59,150
Yeah.

1148
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:00,170
Thanks for everything.

1149
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,250
See you soon.

1150
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:01,410
See you soon.

1151
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,510
So it's this place here, right?

1152
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,070
What?

1153
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,410
Oh man, I'm gonna get a bento after this.

1154
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,850
It was such a nice place and the customer service was great.

1155
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,830
Maybe I'll go there for the time being.

1156
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,350
I love Bunny Garden!

1157
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:21,890
Oh!

1158
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,150
What can we get?

1159
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,510
You can purchase gifts to give to the cast.

1160
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,230
On rare occasions, the lineup may change.

1161
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,110
Socks!

1162
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,770
Gucci socks!

1163
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:37,110
Perfume.

1164
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:39,250
Makeup.

1165
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:39,890
Plush.

1166
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,210
That is a really expensive plush toy.

1167
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:43,690
Holy cow!

1168
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,750
Macarons?

1169
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,950
I'm thinking the macarons are a good gift, right?

1170
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,280
See?

1171
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,240
It's Gucci but with a Q.

1172
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,020
So wouldn't it not be Coochie?

1173
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,660
I want macarons now.

1174
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,170
I'm thinking about them.

1175
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,030
When I was...

1176
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:18,030
When I lived in Japan, at Family Mart, they released like a pack of two macarons.

1177
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,810
One was strawberry flavored and the other one was pistachio.

1178
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,030
And I'd get it like once a week.

1179
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:25,030
It was so good.

1180
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:28,910
It was so good.

1181
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,510
I'm drooling.

1182
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,190
Yummy.

1183
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,510
Which one was better?

1184
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,210
I think I like the pistachio.

1185
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:38,850
The pistachio one was really...

1186
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:40,770
Oh my god!

1187
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:41,270
Turtles!

1188
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:42,330
Tickets!

1189
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,630
Sorry about the table!

1190
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:44,090
Stop!

1191
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:46,530
Stop!

1192
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:47,210
Thank you!

1193
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:47,830
Thank you!

1194
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,250
Okay.

1195
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:53,470
Okay.

1196
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:02,890
Let's get some macarons.

1197
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,970
Cha-ching!

1198
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:07,290
What's my schedule?

1199
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,270
You can check the schedule except...

1200
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,010
Her birthday!

1201
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:13,470
Oh.

1202
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,090
Okay.

1203
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,530
We can only stay up until September.

1204
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,090
What is the dispatch?

1205
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:23,430
Oh, we're not recruiting.

1206
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:23,890
Okay.

1207
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:29,110
You can get the vacation to a cast member who invited you.

1208
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,970
We can go...

1209
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,850
Oh wait.

1210
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:39,900
Continue.

1211
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,000
There we go.

1212
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,940
We can gamble.

1213
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:43,920
You can try gambling.

1214
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,060
Of course, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

1215
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,540
Keep your fingers crossed and consider taking on the challenge.

1216
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,580
Um, yeah, I do wanna gamble a little bit.

1217
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:54,460
Gambling.

1218
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:57,560
Win!

1219
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:58,520
Win!

1220
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:10,630
That's a lot of money.

1221
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,050
That's a lot of money!

1222
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,410
No, no, no!

1223
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,410
Save, save the game.

1224
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,530
Save the game!

1225
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:19,610
Save the game!

1226
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:20,770
Oh my god, it's so cute.

1227
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,830
Is this a hobby?

1228
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,560
What does that mean?

1229
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,780
Oh, I don't have any.

1230
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,760
I thought I took that picture.

1231
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:41,360
Yo...

1232
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,320
Oh, sold out.

1233
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,580
Okay, time to go to bunny garden.

1234
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,780
I'm rich again.

1235
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,020
Now is my time to rest up and recover.

1236
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:53,140
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

1237
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,820
I think I am Haito and I'm realizing very quickly that I have a problem.

1238
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,960
The cast member who likes you the most will serve you immediately after you enter.

1239
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,240
Increase your likability and you might end up with the cast?

1240
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,200
Oh, you came!

1241
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,100
I'm glad.

1242
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,480
What drink did you want?

1243
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,040
Hmm...

1244
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,120
Hmm...

1245
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,680
Just give me...

1246
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:33,520
Hmm...

1247
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,660
Honka badonka Jesus!

1248
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:44,680
Miyuka...

1249
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,240
Is that... wait...

1250
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,160
Miyuka is the short-haired one, right?

1251
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,740
I am still curious about the other girl, but I feel like she's kind of out of my league.

1252
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,920
I feel like she's kind of like...

1253
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,320
The type that would scare me.

1254
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,380
You know, like...

1255
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,700
The one that's like...

1256
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:11,960
Like she's so... like she's too... she's too social, you know what I mean?

1257
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,400
Give her a chance?

1258
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:15,880
Maybe...

1259
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:21,690
Women scare me.

1260
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,990
Yeah, just gyaru, gyaru, gyaru.

1261
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:26,550
So true.

1262
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,890
Let's get... I'm gonna get just a...

1263
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:37,970
I'm gonna get a fine wine, because I... I earned a lot of money gambling today.

1264
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:43,170
Can I have some too?

1265
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:44,530
No.

1266
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,290
See ya.

1267
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:48,370
Who's coming?

1268
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:49,290
Who's coming over here?

1269
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:50,370
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

1270
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:50,950
I'm scared.

1271
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:56,290
It's Miyuka!

1272
00:58:58,550 --> 00:58:59,390
Sure, what's up?

1273
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,570
Why'd you have to do the hand gesture with it?

1274
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:04,770
You got fired.

1275
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,670
Yeah, I'm the... I'm the guy that got fired.

1276
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,350
Yes, thank you.

1277
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:10,970
You're not gonna let that go, huh?

1278
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:11,990
Sorry.

1279
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:13,530
Name?

1280
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,870
She doesn't remember my name.

1281
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:17,830
Fish want her.

1282
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,010
Women scare her.

1283
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,390
What's your name again?

1284
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:22,990
Hito Kanda.

1285
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:23,970
Hito.

1286
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:25,240
Hito.

1287
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,170
Hito.

1288
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:27,330
Hito.

1289
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:27,810
Hito.

1290
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:28,550
Hito.

1291
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:30,170
Minto.

1292
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:31,630
Minto.

1293
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,770
Everybody, remember my name.

1294
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:35,190
I'm Minto.

1295
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:36,590
I'm Mint.

1296
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:38,490
I'm Mint.

1297
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,230
I'm Mint.

1298
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,530
I'm Mint.

1299
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:42,970
I'm Mint.

1300
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:44,590
Minto.

1301
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:45,770
I'm Mint.

1302
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:47,790
Minto.

1303
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,040
I'm Mint.

1304
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,000
Minto.

1305
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,300
Hito.

1306
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,080
He came again.

1307
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,240
They're back again.

1308
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,960
I came to see you, Miyuka-chan!

1309
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,660
Should I have not come?

1310
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,560
I just ended up here.

1311
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,580
I'm Mint.

1312
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,600
No, you're Murphy.

1313
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,980
I don't care if you've got that silly wig on.

1314
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,160
You sure?

1315
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,820
I'll let you know!

1316
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:34,780
Nope.

1317
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:35,580
I'm not a doctor.

1318
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,620
I know you're scared of me!

1319
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,640
I don't know what to say!

1320
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,960
Just be quiet!

1321
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,200
I don't know what to say!

1322
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,300
I don't know what to say!

1323
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,620
I don't like you!

1324
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,560
I don't know what to say!

1325
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:51,980
I'm sorry!

1326
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,420
I'm so sorry!

1327
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:52,940
In the first place...

1328
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,320
I don't know what to say!

1329
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:53,460
I was having a hard time...

1330
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,660
So, I'll try to explain myself...

1331
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,140
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1332
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,400
I have one, actually.

1333
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,660
No, I meant... No, me!

1334
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:02,620
Play hard to get?

1335
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,300
Should I have not come?

1336
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,660
No, it's not that.

1337
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,080
You must be low on money, though.

1338
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,080
Don't worry, I gambled!

1339
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,780
This is a collecting mission.

1340
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,240
You have to charm all the girls.

1341
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,940
We can't let the other customers have them.

1342
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:28,020
Use code 880.08 Got it, Colonel!

1343
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,100
You're that curry ninja.

1344
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:36,700
I'm helping out my friend now, so it's OK.

1345
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,220
You don't have to worry about that.

1346
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,020
I'm not worried.

1347
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,540
OK.

1348
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,680
Is it my turn to be mint?

1349
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:45,580
Never!

1350
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,540
Unless I possess you.

1351
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:49,840
Actually, I'm mint.

1352
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,740
No, me!

1353
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,000
Me!

1354
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,640
You must spend your money wisely.

1355
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,180
It's necessary to live.

1356
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,380
Yeah, I'll make sure to do that.

1357
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,460
All waifus are OSPs?

1358
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,700
Thanks for coming here to spend that important money.

1359
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,800
You're welcome.

1360
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,960
Thanks for showing me...

1361
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,980
I have a gift for her!

1362
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,700
I feel strange to say you're welcome after that.

1363
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,820
Aw, you smiled for me again.

1364
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,720
It's so creepy when we say that.

1365
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,440
You still haven't had enough to drink.

1366
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:36,440
Do you want to order anything else?

1367
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,380
I too am also mint.

1368
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:38,800
Stop!

1369
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,180
Oh my god, this face is the cutest.

1370
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:46,980
What should I drink?

1371
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,120
What should I drink?

1372
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,880
Should we try...

1373
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,060
What's the other girl's name?

1374
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:52,200
You mean Rin?

1375
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,120
That's what you guys said?

1376
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:55,820
Mhmm...

1377
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:58,680
Umm...

1378
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:00,520
Okay,

1379
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:06,700
let's try.

1380
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,140
I'm going to get something cheap.

1381
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,900
Can I drink with you?

1382
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:17,100
Oh...

1383
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:17,960
Sorry...

1384
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,860
Thank you for all the super chats, you guys!

1385
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,460
Thank you!

1386
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,960
Looks like a customer is calling, so I better get going.

1387
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,560
Bye bye!

1388
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,440
She's so cute!

1389
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,500
Oh my gosh, Wei, she's so cute!

1390
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,680
She's so...

1391
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:49,900
Sorry,

1392
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,320
I got that gamer posture.

1393
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,260
She calls me cute!

1394
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,760
Why are you curled up in a ball, sir?

1395
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,360
What's wrong?

1396
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,580
She's really cute.

1397
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,060
He must be nervous.

1398
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,040
That's no good.

1399
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,400
Getting nervous over me is just a waste of energy.

1400
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,560
Hello, my name is Haito Kanda.

1401
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,920
It's a pleasure to meet your acquaintance.

1402
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:21,600
Ukeru!

1403
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,910
She's too gyaru.

1404
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:32,930
So dazzling!

1405
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:36,750
That's hilarious!

1406
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:38,150
Ukeru!

1407
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:39,970
You started introducing yourself.

1408
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,050
Then I'll introduce myself.

1409
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,090
Hello, my name is Pin.

1410
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,590
I'll lend you a hand.

1411
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:49,730
What is this?

1412
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:50,770
Is this okay?

1413
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,350
Suddenly speaking in Keigo.

1414
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:54,770
I will too.

1415
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,250
Hello, I'm Rin.

1416
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:58,210
Pepper

1417
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,580
in my throat.

1418
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,280
I had a pepper in my throat.

1419
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:37,500
Oh, my God.

1420
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,480
I'm crying.

1421
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,700
Girl started coughing and straight up passed away.

1422
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,760
Oh, my God.

1423
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:51,120
Hold on.

1424
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,880
I'm going to go get some more water.

1425
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,320
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1426
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,100
Give me one second.

1427
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:58,860
I'm so sorry.

1428
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,480
I told you, it's the gyaru.

1429
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:03,840
It's the gyaru.

1430
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,460
I can't deal with the gyaru.

1431
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,300
I can't deal with the gyaru.

1432
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:23,290
I'm back.

1433
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:24,450
Sorry about that.

1434
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:27,290
I'm back with baby tomatoes.

1435
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:35,930
Okay, Rin is actually trying to...

1436
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:38,570
Actually trying to...

1437
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:41,390
Like, exercise my soul.

1438
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:42,050
But that's okay.

1439
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:43,170
That's okay.

1440
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:45,590
That's a-okay.

1441
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:51,230
Hai-chan.

1442
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:55,910
What do you do, Hai-chan?

1443
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,750
Right now, I'm assisting an acquaintance with their job.

1444
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,440
Oh, my gosh.

1445
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,660
You can't keep saying that.

1446
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,920
You're such a mess up, my guy.

1447
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:07,940
Stop saying...

1448
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:08,980
Don't say a plethora...

1449
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:09,080
Okay.

1450
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,460
Until recently, I was employed at a company.

1451
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,860
However, due to a plethora of mistakes, I was terminated.

1452
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,600
That does not make you look good.

1453
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,060
Why are you...

1454
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,500
Why are you saying that?

1455
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:20,960
Why...

1456
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,020
This guy has the worst, like...

1457
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,640
Elevator pitch ever.

1458
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,180
Wait, Hai-chan.

1459
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,260
I'm not good at honorifics.

1460
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,520
I don't know how to talk or listen.

1461
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:35,400
That's why...

1462
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,120
If you stop using honorifics...

1463
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,720
I'll be really saved.

1464
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:39,860
I'll be really grateful.

1465
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,420
I get her, though.

1466
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,560
I get her so much.

1467
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,820
Hang on, Hai-chan.

1468
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:46,160
I can't keep up with the...

1469
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:46,820
Keep up...

1470
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,640
Keep up with all that formal speech.

1471
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,760
I'd be, like, super grateful if you could just, like, talk normally.

1472
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:53,620
Boy failure.

1473
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,280
So true.

1474
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,380
Oh, really?

1475
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,000
I'll drop the pretenses, then.

1476
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,280
Thank you.

1477
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,240
What?

1478
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,720
Hai-chan is such a kind person.

1479
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It's not good for a company to appoint such a person.

1480
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,600
It's better to fire her rather than fire her.

1481
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,300
Thank you.

1482
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:13,440
You're such a nice guy, Hai-chan.

1483
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,860
It's, like, their loss for firing you.

1484
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,220
You're, like, way better off without them.

1485
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,160
She's so cute.

1486
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,600
Oh, my gosh.

1487
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:22,360
She's so cute.

1488
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,160
Look at her.

1489
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,740
Look at her smug little face.

1490
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:25,500
Oh, my gosh.

1491
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:25,740
Wait.

1492
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:27,120
I think I like Rin a lot.

1493
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,280
No, they treated me pretty well.

1494
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,000
But I'm getting by okay now.

1495
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:32,760
Yeah.

1496
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,080
Hai-chan, you're just so great.

1497
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,800
I respect you for not blaming the company that fired you.

1498
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,180
I respect you for not blaming the company that fired you.

1499
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:44,100
Wow.

1500
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,780
You're really something, Hai-chan.

1501
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:49,460
Like, you won't even badmouth them, even after getting fired.

1502
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,740
I respect that.

1503
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,660
Yarumin, my dreams come true.

1504
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,820
What dreams are you having?

1505
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:01,120
You're often told that Hai-chan is a kind, decent, and good person.

1506
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,200
I'm gonna do it.

1507
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,920
I'm gonna give her my macarons.

1508
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,360
You're, like, a stand-up guy.

1509
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:08,780
You must get that a lot.

1510
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,100
A lot, huh?

1511
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:12,280
Let me hear some more.

1512
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,980
Let me hear some more.

1513
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,090
Who is they?

1514
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:27,690
They do.

1515
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:28,910
You must get that a lot.

1516
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:29,730
They do what?

1517
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:30,070
Who?

1518
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:32,710
I want some more.

1519
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:33,110
Oh, yeah.

1520
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:33,950
I want some more.

1521
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,470
Let me hear some more.

1522
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,970
Hai-chan, you're a kind, decent, and good person.

1523
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:44,050
You're really kind, decent, and good person.

1524
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:48,770
Oh, my God.

1525
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:49,710
I paid for this service.

1526
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:50,230
You know what?

1527
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:53,970
You're such a kind, upstanding person, Hai-chan.

1528
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:56,470
It's so true, you know?

1529
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:59,570
You're so kind and so upstanding.

1530
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:00,750
Like...

1531
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,190
How is that?

1532
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:02,770
Oh, yeah.

1533
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:04,790
You know what?

1534
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:05,230
I'm gonna tell you something.

1535
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,110
I'm gonna take this seriously.

1536
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,570
I'm always serious, but seriously serious.

1537
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:12,690
Seriously.

1538
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:13,170
Seriously.

1539
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:13,890
Seriously.

1540
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,470
Seriously serious.

1541
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:28,430
Meeting new people is really important, right?

1542
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:29,170
In life.

1543
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:33,450
That's why I'm grateful for meeting you, Hai-chan.

1544
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:47,070
So I'm really grateful to have met you, Hai-chan.

1545
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:49,130
Oh my gosh, she's so sweet.

1546
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,520
I'm hook, line, and sunk.

1547
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,280
Gosh, I've been fished by Rin.

1548
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:11,590
I think so.

1549
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:17,510
I may be far from perfect, but I'll still do the very best I can.

1550
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:18,410
Hope you're ready!

1551
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,410
Oh my god, look how cute she is!

1552
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,740
She's just a silly girl!

1553
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:39,660
She's just a silly girl!

1554
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:42,180
How embarrassing!

1555
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,340
Wait, like, what am I saying?

1556
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,620
I'm just, like, so silly.

1557
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,960
Well, you get the idea, right?

1558
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,280
Did you catch all that?

1559
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,620
Because I won't say it again.

1560
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,360
Ukeru!

1561
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:56,440
Besides, the other girls are all good girls.

1562
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,340
I'm sure you'll like this place.

1563
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,160
Oh my god, and she's even vouching for the other girls.

1564
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,180
She's like the best.

1565
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:05,040
She's a girl's girl.

1566
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,800
She's an everybody's girl.

1567
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:07,560
She's so great!

1568
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:12,520
Focus on the prize and keep glancing at the other two girls.

1569
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,240
I'm trying to decide, you know?

1570
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,220
You know?

1571
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:20,580
But it is kind of like one of those, like, when you see the other girls, you're like, what am I missing out on, you know?

1572
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:37,240
By the way, the other girls here are all really nice, too.

1573
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,160
I think you'll like this shop a lot.

1574
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:53,360
If you find that I'm not your type after talking to me a few times, feel free to sats...

1575
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:54,260
sa...

1576
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:55,140
s...

1577
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:55,840
siddle...

1578
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:56,540
so...

1579
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,080
saddle...

1580
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,200
saddle...

1581
01:13:59,200 --> 01:13:59,920
s...

1582
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:02,440
s...

1583
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:02,700
slide...

1584
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,540
s...

1585
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,360
What does this mean?

1586
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:10,860
siddle...

1587
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:17,940
siddle...

1588
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:21,520
Up next to another girl instead.

1589
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:22,820
Oh my god, she's so sweet.

1590
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,860
I'm not the type of girl who's, like, bothered by that sort of thing.

1591
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:30,980
Write me a letter.

1592
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,080
I'm not the type who's bothered by that sort of thing.

1593
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:41,820
Well, on the other hand, if you do find that I'm your type, it'd make me, like, pretty happy.

1594
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,840
Oh, I didn't know you were that kind of person.

1595
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,040
So, I'm getting the hang of it.

1596
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:48,980
See you, Hai-chan.

1597
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:52,220
I don't know how I feel about her, like, rubbing her hands though, like a...

1598
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,760
like a bond villain.

1599
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,340
Maybe she...

1600
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:59,180
Maybe she's coming?

1601
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:01,540
Maybe she's a little more evil than we know, you know?

1602
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,480
She's like, yes!

1603
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:06,740
Yes!

1604
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:12,460
Yes, buy the bunny trap!

1605
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:13,340
Yes!

1606
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,580
I'm not the type to get upset about those things.

1607
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,460
But you know you want to stick with me.

1608
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:19,620
Yes!

1609
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,420
She's scheming.

1610
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,020
Well, I'll leave it at that for now.

1611
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:28,840
With that said, I look forward to serving you, Hai-chan.

1612
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,420
Have you not had enough to drink, Hai-chan?

1613
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:40,420
If you want some more, I can get you some.

1614
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,000
Ah, yes.

1615
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:49,100
You did it!

1616
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,720
I was about to get so lonely!

1617
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,440
She has the same embarrassed pervert smile as me.

1618
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,400
What are you talking about?

1619
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,340
What do I want?

1620
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,040
The bunny trap, of course.

1621
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,280
Wait, does it even matter what I...

1622
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:13,080
So wait, I guess it does matter what I order.

1623
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,780
Because the more I spend, the more they like me, right?

1624
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:18,020
So...

1625
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:23,340
So it's just an overall price.

1626
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,340
Yeah, yeah.

1627
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,080
It's delicious, isn't it?

1628
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,440
This tastes so good.

1629
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:37,440
Itadakimasu!

1630
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:38,900
Itadakimasu!

1631
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,120
She's so cute.

1632
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,320
It's delicious!

1633
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,900
Let's give her the present.

1634
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,400
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

1635
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,540
I hope you like it.

1636
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,440
Oh, Azumas?

1637
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,020
Azumas?

1638
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,220
I got something good.

1639
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:07,060
I'm not good with honorifics.

1640
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,120
I really can't.

1641
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,120
What is that?

1642
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,860
Can we rizz all three?

1643
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:16,180
Can our wallet handle it?

1644
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:18,980
I don't know.

1645
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,140
Man, I'm really no good at this formal stuff.

1646
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,460
I just can't do it.

1647
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,680
What good is it anyway?

1648
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,600
It's meant to show respect to the person you're speaking to.

1649
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,640
Haha, I know what you mean.

1650
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,880
But even if it's not formal language, you're still a parent, right?

1651
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,060
Yeah, I know that much.

1652
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,100
But you can still show respect without it, right?

1653
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,640
Oh my god, she messed up her words.

1654
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:53,640
So cute.

1655
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:58,080
I guess it's a way to easily convey that to respect the person.

1656
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,780
That's a simple thing.

1657
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,540
I don't think you need it, but it's a pain in the ass.

1658
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,520
That's too on the nose.

1659
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:08,120
I don't think that'd be necessary.

1660
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:09,900
It'd be annoying for one thing.

1661
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,200
Some people place a lot of importance on that sort of thing.

1662
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,900
Can we get drunk in this game?

1663
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,520
That's true.

1664
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:19,300
I don't know how many times I've been drunk.

1665
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:21,940
Oh, that's true.

1666
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,500
I can't tell you how many times I've been snapped at.

1667
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,020
Well, but...

1668
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,240
You can.

1669
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,680
You can?

1670
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,660
Where's the drunk meter?

1671
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,560
I guess I don't want to leave people with rotten feelings either.

1672
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:43,660
I've got no choice but to brush up on speaking more formally.

1673
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:52,580
Oh wait, this is good practice for me too.

1674
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,280
Hahaha.

1675
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,440
The best way is to learn through experience.

1676
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,460
I'll try it now.

1677
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,840
Okay, let's start!

1678
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,640
Are you doing well, Rin-chan?

1679
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:02,400
Yes.

1680
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,140
Yes.

1681
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,860
Do you enjoy this job?

1682
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,460
Is she only just going to say hi to everything?

1683
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:09,280
Yes.

1684
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,120
Yes.

1685
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,940
Do you like formal speech?

1686
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:13,820
No.

1687
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:14,440
No?

1688
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:15,600
No.

1689
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,980
Do you have any hobbies, Rin-chan?

1690
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:18,980
Reading.

1691
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:20,620
Reading.

1692
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:20,720
Reading.

1693
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,840
Let's stop, Rin-chan.

1694
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,480
You're fine the way you are now.

1695
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,760
Wow, is it already this late?

1696
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,740
I'm going to go back.

1697
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,360
Oh my gosh, I think I'm losing brain cells just talking to her.

1698
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:44,550
Thank you, Rin-chan.

1699
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:45,330
Bye-bye.

1700
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:45,950
See you tomorrow.

1701
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:48,110
Thanks for everything.

1702
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:48,710
See you soon.

1703
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,920
I'm motivated for...

1704
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,080
Ah!

1705
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:00,190
Ah!

1706
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:03,490
That's what I imagined.

1707
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:04,410
That's like...

1708
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:08,270
Oh!

1709
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:10,090
I didn't see them tomorrow.

1710
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:11,750
Oh, I got paid a lot though.

1711
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:30,440
Gambling time.

1712
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,400
Come on.

1713
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,660
Come on.

1714
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:40,860
Come on.

1715
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:41,340
Kamisama!

1716
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:49,320
No!

1717
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:02,830
Okay, one more.

1718
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:03,230
One more.

1719
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:03,490
We'll see.

1720
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:03,810
We'll see.

1721
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,310
I know I save scum, but I want to...

1722
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:07,390
I want to have...

1723
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:09,070
I want to have the belief.

1724
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:09,770
That...

1725
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:10,110
Wait.

1726
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:10,970
The red eye?

1727
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:12,070
That wasn't there before, right?

1728
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:12,910
This is good, right?

1729
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:13,590
This is good?

1730
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:15,310
Oh.

1731
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,270
We can win it back.

1732
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:29,850
Gambling buns.

1733
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:31,570
This is it.

1734
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:33,290
We'll win it all back and then some.

1735
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:37,470
Yike!

1736
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:42,830
I think...

1737
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:45,530
I think we won it all back.

1738
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:46,010
Actually.

1739
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,480
I don't think we made even a single...

1740
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,900
A little... Yenny back.

1741
01:21:58,600 --> 01:21:59,460
Oh, still down?

1742
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,720
Okay, one more time, one more time.

1743
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:04,940
5K short.

1744
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:06,120
Oh, two!

1745
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,260
Two eyes, two eyes.

1746
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:11,080
Two eyes, two eyes, two eyes.

1747
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:21,790
Really, really, Mint?

1748
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,070
Really.

1749
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:24,990
Really.

1750
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:28,010
One more, one more, one more.

1751
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:29,750
One more.

1752
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:32,950
Uh-oh, it's two eyes again.

1753
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:33,910
I don't trust it anymore.

1754
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:03,130
Congratulations on your silver button.

1755
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:03,910
Thanks, Joshua!

1756
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:09,290
I like how whenever you're eating sometimes, you sometimes pout in and out.

1757
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:10,690
Even during yesterday's stream.

1758
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:12,190
It's so cute, like a little chipmunk.

1759
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:14,370
Or dare I even say it, a bunny.

1760
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:19,760
Stupid.

1761
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,920
Stop watching me eat.

1762
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,540
Stop watching me eat.

1763
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,100
Okay, well that's the last one.

1764
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:33,360
Okay, well that's the last one.

1765
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:34,920
This is it!

1766
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,620
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it, this is it!

1767
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,040
Come on!

1768
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,260
I think we should reset the save.

1769
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,540
I think we should... Oh no, no, no!

1770
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,200
I pressed, I pressed, I pressed one more on accident!

1771
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,800
I pressed instinctually instead of the go back.

1772
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,320
Uh-oh, oh god.

1773
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,840
It's okay, we're gonna reload anyway.

1774
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:30,960
Unless...

1775
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:32,880
Ooh!

1776
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,840
Not enough though.

1777
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:53,170
Okay.

1778
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:58,590
Most gamblers quit just before they win big.

1779
01:24:59,110 --> 01:24:59,830
I know.

1780
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,660
What else can we buy?

1781
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,000
Hmm.

1782
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:15,640
I think she would like a necklace, but I'm not rich enough yet to really... Oh, perfume!

1783
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,440
She would like that.

1784
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:19,740
Mm-hmm.

1785
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,440
Motivation up!

1786
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,040
Okay.

1787
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,200
One dispatch consumes two days.

1788
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,320
Be careful not to overwork and ruin your health.

1789
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:38,700
Okay.

1790
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:41,640
We can get so much more!

1791
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,240
Any hairstyle.

1792
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,240
Inaba, inaba, inaba.

1793
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,700
Just gamble more.

1794
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,840
It wastes a day though.

1795
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:53,800
Yeah, you're right.

1796
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:54,920
I don't know.

1797
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,720
It's not that much for just...

1798
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,620
Well, actually it's more than I...

1799
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,160
It's more than I made in a whole week.

1800
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,900
But with just one day, right?

1801
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,880
No, two days.

1802
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:06,960
It wastes a week.

1803
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:12,400
But then do I also get the money from my friend on top of that?

1804
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:19,550
Do I also get the...

1805
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,880
Gambling looks more worth it.

1806
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,880
Gambling is safer?

1807
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:40,360
Oh, wait.

1808
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,480
Oh, I made 500...

1809
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,340
Wait, I made 57k?

1810
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:44,700
Oh, just kidding.

1811
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:45,400
Never mind.

1812
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,000
Get out of here.

1813
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,100
I can gamble.

1814
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,640
The game says I can gamble.

1815
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,360
What a gamble.

1816
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:56,220
Just once.

1817
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,220
Just once, you guys.

1818
01:26:59,300 --> 01:26:59,580
Just once.

1819
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,340
I'm preying on you, big boss!

1820
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:06,720
Boss!

1821
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:10,940
Woo!

1822
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:19,850
Don't pray to God.

1823
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:20,910
Pray to big boss.

1824
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,190
You wanna continue gambling?

1825
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:23,670
No, okay.

1826
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:27,470
Now I'm gonna go spend lots of money on girls!

1827
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:30,650
Now is my time to spend money.

1828
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:31,910
I mean, rest up and recover.

1829
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:34,550
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

1830
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:39,650
Woo!

1831
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,170
Cast members may be away on Saturdays.

1832
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:46,870
Why not try having a conversation with other cast members?

1833
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:50,850
Thanks, Rin-chan!

1834
01:27:51,490 --> 01:27:51,510
Thanks, Rin-chan!

1835
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:51,750
What are you drinking?

1836
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:53,030
What?

1837
01:27:53,370 --> 01:27:53,890
What?

1838
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:55,990
Hmm...

1839
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:57,630
Hmm...

1840
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:02,750
I won big today!

1841
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:04,230
We're getting...

1842
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:05,330
Oh, wait.

1843
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:07,030
If I get this...

1844
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:09,210
I want that for her.

1845
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:12,850
You're a simp.

1846
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:13,830
Yeah, I am.

1847
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:14,390
Thank you.

1848
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:17,270
I'm simping for my bunny, Oshii.

1849
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:19,190
So she has funds to simp for other bunny girls.

1850
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:20,570
The circle of life!

1851
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:21,730
Stop!

1852
01:28:25,290 --> 01:28:26,370
Yeah, get that for her.

1853
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:27,710
Okay, I'll get the bunny trap again.

1854
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:31,430
Of course, Rin-chan!

1855
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,530
G-g-g-g-g-g...

1856
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:34,170
G -g-g-g-g-g-g...

1857
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:35,130
Ta-da!

1858
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:39,570
Really?

1859
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:40,650
Hurray!

1860
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:41,590
I'll get the bottle!

1861
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:45,990
This is like... so actually at maid cafes, you can do stuff like this too.

1862
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:51,170
And like a lot of cafes, like themed cafes in Japan...

1863
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:55,410
Like you can buy a champagne bottle and just like...

1864
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:58,450
Share with the girls and stuff like that.

1865
01:28:58,630 --> 01:28:59,790
Sometimes you can...

1866
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:06,870
I think sometimes you can even buy a bottle and just for the girl to keep.

1867
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:09,070
Like you don't even get to drink any of it.

1868
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:13,810
Wow!

1869
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,650
That looks more than before, right?

1870
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:21,110
Am I crazy?

1871
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:26,190
That looks like the more... the more... the more... the more...

1872
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:29,910
Lacey, a little bit.

1873
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:31,810
I have a present for you.

1874
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:36,910
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

1875
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:38,110
I hope you'll like it.

1876
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:40,190
Azumas?

1877
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:44,370
She liked it.

1878
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:51,370
I'm glad you came back.

1879
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:52,030
Thank you!

1880
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:53,450
Like, have you been good?

1881
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:56,790
Yeah, you seem like you're in a good mood too, Nin-chan.

1882
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:03,030
Brain MC only, but...

1883
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:12,370
What good would I be if I couldn't put on a smile?

1884
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:13,830
I'm fine.

1885
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,730
You actually don't look like you're feeling so great yourself.

1886
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:17,050
Really?

1887
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:19,990
I'm feeling fine physically today and I don't have any problems.

1888
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:25,270
I'm not?

1889
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:26,350
I'm not?

1890
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:29,110
You're definitely not feeling good.

1891
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:30,010
Not at all.

1892
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:37,790
This is a bad omen, you know?

1893
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:38,330
Get it?

1894
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:39,510
Today's fortune!

1895
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:41,550
Oh my god, she's an empath!

1896
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:42,130
Yeah...

1897
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:48,830
Oh my god, no way.

1898
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:53,750
Not only is she scamming me, like, in the bar, but she's also scamming me.

1899
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:55,730
She's a scamming fortune teller too.

1900
01:30:55,970 --> 01:30:57,010
Oh my god, no!

1901
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,150
Where's Kana?

1902
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:00,370
It said she took the day off.

1903
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:04,510
On Saturdays, it said that they can sometimes take the day off.

1904
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:06,910
But hey sir, you're lucky.

1905
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:09,110
In fact, I can judge based on your name.

1906
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:09,890
Wanna try?

1907
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:13,850
Like fortune telling with names?

1908
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:15,570
Sure, I'll give it a try.

1909
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:16,570
Okay, okay.

1910
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:19,230
Um, I know your name.

1911
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:22,750
You told me about it the other day, right?

1912
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:24,750
Mm-hmm.

1913
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:26,170
Do you remember it?

1914
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:29,910
I know your name already.

1915
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:31,850
You told me what it was last time, right?

1916
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:34,030
Yeah, I introduced myself to you.

1917
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:36,230
Yeah, I know, I know.

1918
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:38,810
I know, but it's not that.

1919
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:38,810
It's not that.

1920
01:31:39,210 --> 01:31:40,810
It's the kanji, right?

1921
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:41,910
The life judgment.

1922
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,880
I've had to do this before.

1923
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,500
I've had to do this before.

1924
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:05,220
One time, one time I... I met someone that I had met before.

1925
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,600
But I couldn't remember their name.

1926
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:11,040
And I had to write down their name for something.

1927
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,320
And I was just like, oh, hi.

1928
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,820
Um, I'm taking everybody's names.

1929
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:19,260
I just need to make sure it's spelled correctly.

1930
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,380
Can you let me know how to spell it?

1931
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:22,260
And they were like...

1932
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:25,180
It was like the most simple name ever.

1933
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:26,020
I don't even remember.

1934
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:29,880
It was like... like Mike or something.

1935
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,500
They were like, Mike?

1936
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,240
And I was like, oh.

1937
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:40,210
Yep.

1938
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:43,330
You know, I could have been with like... I don't know.

1939
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:44,550
A C?

1940
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:47,910
A Q?

1941
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,210
So I was like...

1942
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:56,650
Thank you.

1943
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:05,110
I need to know how it's spelled to do the fortune telling.

1944
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:10,630
How do you spell your name in kanji?

1945
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:13,850
Oh, she's at... see... you can get away with that in Japan, right?

1946
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:17,870
Oh, actually...

1947
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:20,750
Should we do Kanda or Haito?

1948
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:23,850
Hmm... she likes to be formal.

1949
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:24,770
I mean, not formal.

1950
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:26,630
She likes to be informal, so...

1951
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:29,530
Mike.

1952
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:39,910
It's spelled in Hiragana?

1953
01:33:40,130 --> 01:33:44,030
Oh, she might like that too because she's dumb and she can't spell... she can't write the kanji.

1954
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,090
It's spelled in Hiragana.

1955
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,420
No way.

1956
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,880
Then my strategy is totally... darn.

1957
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:59,920
I read that this would be 100% foolproof.

1958
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,600
First the character's for Cup and Person.

1959
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:05,480
Then Dry and Field.

1960
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,380
That's how you spell Haito Kanda.

1961
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:08,620
Do you remember now?

1962
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:12,120
Cup and person.

1963
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:13,760
So...

1964
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:23,620
Oh wait, see I was thinking Kan... like the Kami-sama Kan.

1965
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:24,700
And then...

1966
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,580
Da is field, yeah.

1967
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,920
The rice field.

1968
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,180
Cup person dry field.

1969
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:36,860
Cup person!

1970
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,160
You got me, huh?

1971
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,860
I like totally forgot your name.

1972
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:42,460
Really sorry.

1973
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:43,760
Aw, she looks sorry.

1974
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:49,780
She's cute.

1975
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:51,140
She tried, you know?

1976
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:51,580
She tried.

1977
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:55,660
Cup head.

1978
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:00,600
I found a way online to learn someone's name after you forget it.

1979
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:03,220
I set to offer to tell their fortune with it.

1980
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,100
Clever, huh?

1981
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,360
How did you figure it out?

1982
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,700
Was I acting suspicious?

1983
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,920
You seem like the type of person who can't tell a lie, Rin-chan.

1984
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,500
It was written all over your face and how you were acting.

1985
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,040
I get it.

1986
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:21,860
I get it.

1987
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:22,600
People often tell me you're a pervert.

1988
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:27,680
People usually tell me they can read me like an open book.

1989
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:30,200
To be honest, I'm going to live.

1990
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:33,220
In the first place, it's hard to cover it up with a lie.

1991
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,080
It's better to talk honestly, get scolded and apologize.

1992
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:40,080
Sorry, I totally remember.

1993
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:41,460
How do you spell your name again?

1994
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:42,320
Mint.

1995
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,020
Mint.

1996
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,040
Mint.

1997
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:45,260
Mint.

1998
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:45,960
Mentos.

1999
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,500
First with an M, just like my arms.

2000
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,960
Then with an I, I'm standing tall.

2001
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,160
Then with an N, no other way.

2002
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:01,180
Last is a T.

2003
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,320
Take it away.

2004
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,100
Mint.

2005
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:22,320
You guys are still spelling it wrong.

2006
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,100
Did you freestyle that?

2007
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:25,140
I freestyle everything.

2008
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,300
I'll live honestly.

2009
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:32,280
It's like so tiring to cover things up with lies.

2010
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:36,080
It's easier to just be honest and then apologize when you get scolded.

2011
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:38,320
I'm really sorry, Hai-chan.

2012
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,360
You told me your name, but I forgot it.

2013
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:43,620
I was trying to fool you.

2014
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:45,760
I'm really sorry.

2015
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:47,740
I'm really sorry, Hai-chan.

2016
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:49,940
You told me your name, but I forgot it.

2017
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:51,680
And I tried to pull the wool over your eyes.

2018
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,640
I'm really sorry.

2019
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:54,040
It's alright.

2020
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,740
It didn't bother me at all.

2021
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:57,700
It just matter.

2022
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:58,860
How am I supposed to be mad?

2023
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,140
Made menthol stuff.

2024
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,700
For real?

2025
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:07,600
Like, yay.

2026
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,920
Let's kick back and have some fun.

2027
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,860
We'll go extra hard today to make up for my...

2028
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,320
Make up for my screw up.

2029
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:16,740
Tint.

2030
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,280
No.

2031
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,880
I said M like my arms.

2032
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:20,100
I said M like my arms.

2033
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:22,240
Do you want to go out for a drink?

2034
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,680
Time totally flies when I'm with you, Hai-chan.

2035
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:27,580
What should we do?

2036
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,540
Will you stay with me for a few more rounds?

2037
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:30,640
Yes.

2038
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:31,280
Alright!

2039
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:32,760
Let's continue.

2040
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,040
Alright!

2041
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:35,700
Actually...

2042
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,120
Actually...

2043
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:38,740
Alright.

2044
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:39,520
Let's go.

2045
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:44,620
What do you want to drink?

2046
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:46,180
What do you want to drink?

2047
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,200
I think I've already spent a good amount of money.

2048
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,480
So I'm going to get a highball.

2049
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:55,700
An elegant finish that cannot be found at other places.

2050
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,860
Made mic stuff.

2051
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:07,260
Of course.

2052
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,500
Wait, I already got this, right?

2053
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:12,740
Yeah.

2054
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,800
We're going to get you...

2055
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:18,940
Let's get you the...

2056
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,880
The bunny punch again.

2057
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,360
You like this, don't you?

2058
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:26,140
Because it's delicious.

2059
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,260
Delicious.

2060
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:29,820
Here we go.

2061
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,420
I've got to reach for it.

2062
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,980
It's written like...

2063
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:38,540
Bink.

2064
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:39,480
No!

2065
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:41,640
What's the food?

2066
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,020
Oh, edamame!

2067
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:45,900
Oh my god, pizza.

2068
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:46,800
Wow!

2069
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:48,780
Quality suit...

2070
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:50,760
I feel like these should be switched, right?

2071
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:52,560
Special parfait.

2072
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:58,560
Hope you're enjoying your time with the spiciest yellow bunny girl, Rin Minto.

2073
01:38:58,820 --> 01:38:59,580
Thank you!

2074
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:02,840
Yes.

2075
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:05,520
Pizza.

2076
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:08,320
Additive free pizzas.

2077
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:08,780
What?

2078
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:12,340
This place is fancy.

2079
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,240
Assorted candies.

2080
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:16,920
Salad.

2081
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:18,760
Rich flavor.

2082
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:19,880
Everything is...

2083
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,660
A lot of potato flavor.

2084
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:29,420
When she rubs her hands together, I can only see the guy in the yellow suit behind the tree meme.

2085
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,740
What's that one?

2086
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,880
My Kamiyoshi Michael Phantom.

2087
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,340
That's not my name.

2088
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,680
I want some french fries.

2089
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,560
This is delicious, right?

2090
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:43,000
Delicious!

2091
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:44,700
Hai-chan.

2092
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:45,480
Are you a ghost?

2093
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:45,780
No, I'm not a ghost.

2094
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:46,080
Something is wrong.

2095
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:47,760
Are you okay?

2096
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,000
No, I'm not.

2097
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,740
Are you okay with ghosts?

2098
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,080
What about you, Rin-chan?

2099
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:51,980
Are you afraid of them?

2100
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:52,380
Okay.

2101
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:54,880
This...

2102
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,340
Rin-chan, don't let me down.

2103
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:00,900
Don't let me down, Rin-chan.

2104
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,400
This is...

2105
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:04,280
I know I am.

2106
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:04,740
Thank you.

2107
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:06,300
All natural pizza.

2108
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,420
Fresh off the pizza tree.

2109
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,060
Don't let me down!

2110
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:12,580
Don't let me down, Rin!

2111
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:15,660
Don't play with me!

2112
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,100
If someone shows up in front of me, will I be a hit on the spot?

2113
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:23,950
W-w-w-w-welp.

2114
01:40:27,290 --> 01:40:32,560
W-w-w-w-w-welp!

2115
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,500
If one showed up in front of me, I'll smack it!

2116
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:40,700
S-smack it.

2117
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:42,480
I guess I would.

2118
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:44,060
Look at her face, though.

2119
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:46,140
Is she...

2120
01:40:58,710 --> 01:41:00,530
I'm not afraid of them.

2121
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:02,210
I'm not afraid of them.

2122
01:41:03,570 --> 01:41:04,970
I'm not afraid of them.

2123
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:10,050
Right?

2124
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:16,390
People are just scared of them.

2125
01:41:16,670 --> 01:41:18,850
Like, all they can do is startle you, basically.

2126
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:23,530
I guess it's time for my username to be...

2127
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:25,750
To be relevant again.

2128
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,290
Thanks, ghost hacker!

2129
01:41:37,190 --> 01:41:39,710
I can do way more than just startle you, Rin.

2130
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:45,680
Have you ever seen a ghost before, Rin-chan?

2131
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,400
I haven't.

2132
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:55,240
I wish one would show itself to me at least once.

2133
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,120
I'm right here!

2134
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,180
I'm right here!

2135
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:01,920
I'm right in front of you!

2136
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,020
Wait, so she can smack me?

2137
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:08,200
Yeah, maybe they're afraid of you because they think you're going to smack them.

2138
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:14,760
The poor things.

2139
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,940
I just want to see one.

2140
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,560
Maybe you'll meet one if you hang around abandoned buildings or haunted spots.

2141
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:28,440
Or, you know, like an abandoned maid cafe!

2142
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:33,700
I can't!

2143
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:34,160
I can't!

2144
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:34,800
I can't!

2145
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:34,800
I can't!

2146
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:35,560
I can't!

2147
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:35,680
I can't!

2148
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:38,060
Abandoned buildings are way too scary!

2149
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,160
No way!

2150
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:39,620
No way!

2151
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:42,080
Why is chat spamming Bustin?

2152
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:42,820
Am I missing something?

2153
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,000
Are they?

2154
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:47,820
To be honest, I didn't notice.

2155
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,420
I thought you weren't afraid of ghosts.

2156
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,240
I'm not afraid of ghosts because they look weak.

2157
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,780
But I'm afraid of monsters.

2158
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:56,720
What?

2159
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:57,260
What?

2160
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:58,580
Weak?

2161
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:01,060
Weak?

2162
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:03,420
Excuse me?

2163
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:04,560
Weak?

2164
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:10,910
Ghosts seem weak, so they aren't scary.

2165
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:13,470
But if a monster jumped out, I'd be terrified.

2166
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,040
Not weak...

2167
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:31,440
Not weak...

2168
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,420
Abandoned buildings are dark and damp, you know?

2169
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:44,000
Monsters like places like that.

2170
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:45,260
They could pop out for sure!

2171
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:45,400
Sure.

2172
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:48,660
I thought monsters and ghosts were basically the same thing.

2173
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:53,060
Um, actually...

2174
01:43:59,260 --> 01:43:59,780
Yabakunai?

2175
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,040
Um, actually, not at all.

2176
01:44:03,180 --> 01:44:04,300
They're totally different.

2177
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,000
I could never fight a monster.

2178
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,420
Those guys seem tough.

2179
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:09,080
They're huge with fangs and claws.

2180
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:10,040
Too risky.

2181
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:18,180
She's kinda cute when she's scared.

2182
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,840
Ah, so scary!

2183
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,560
That'd be awful if I thought about those monsters tonight!

2184
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,480
Do you need someone to... I could be the...

2185
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,220
She's gonna think about me.

2186
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:37,220
She's gonna think about me.

2187
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:40,420
W, just like your arms.

2188
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,280
E, like the ectoplasm you're made of.

2189
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,920
A, all of the simping.

2190
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,260
Okay, the response this dono deserves.

2191
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:49,140
Weak!

2192
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:51,920
Weak.

2193
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:54,240
Weak, weak, weak.

2194
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:58,100
If that happens, I'm blaming it on you, Hai-chan.

2195
01:44:58,300 --> 01:44:59,960
Next time I see you, I'll smack you.

2196
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:01,200
Just kidding!

2197
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:02,260
For free?

2198
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,940
You have fangs.

2199
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:09,880
I have one fang.

2200
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:11,820
Time to extend!

2201
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:14,060
Let's continue.

2202
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:16,680
All right, all right, all right.

2203
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:18,920
Um, I want something that's gonna... Oh!

2204
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:21,500
Depending on the person, it seems easy to become intoxicated.

2205
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:23,280
I want something that's gonna make me drunk!

2206
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,540
Yeah... What does she like?

2207
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:31,280
Um, I think I've spent a lot of money.

2208
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:33,140
Does she like, uh...

2209
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:34,800
Like a lemon sour?

2210
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,620
No, everybody likes a lemon sour, right?

2211
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:39,840
Ghosts are kinda weak though.

2212
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:40,380
Just hit him with a...

2213
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:40,740
Ow!

2214
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,160
Ow!

2215
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:41,720
Stop it!

2216
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:44,960
Rin's armpit.

2217
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:54,420
She like the berry bunny punch a lot.

2218
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:56,240
Get Rin drunk?

2219
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:57,320
Okay!

2220
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:01,620
Oishi!

2221
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:04,740
Drunk, drunk.

2222
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:05,800
Yeah, girl!

2223
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,780
We're getting ready tonight!

2224
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:07,460
We're partying!

2225
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:11,760
Itadakimasu!

2226
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:17,260
Flat is best.

2227
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:18,280
Flat is justice.

2228
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:22,380
I mean... Flat is justice.

2229
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:23,620
I'm just... But, you know...

2230
01:46:23,620 --> 01:46:26,160
I'm not gonna be against anything.

2231
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:30,600
I'm a... I'm a...

2232
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,620
I'm a booba connoisseur.

2233
01:46:37,220 --> 01:46:42,600
This is bringing back trauma about having to explain my overly-specific knowledge and lingo use with...

2234
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:45,100
Gyaru bunka ga suki to a cute girl.

2235
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:49,820
Let's talk.

2236
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:53,160
What do you usually do when you're home alone, Rin-chan?

2237
01:46:53,640 --> 01:46:57,300
I usually watch anime, read manga, and play games.

2238
01:46:57,980 --> 01:46:59,180
That's all I do.

2239
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:02,220
So you're an otaku too?

2240
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:04,100
She's an otaku!

2241
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:06,040
She's a keeper, everybody!

2242
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,140
What?

2243
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:08,960
Oh my god, best girl!

2244
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,320
She's so good!

2245
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,220
She's a gamer.

2246
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:14,680
She's a... she's a anime enjoyer.

2247
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,260
I usually watch anime and read manga.

2248
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,700
Sometimes I play video games.

2249
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:21,780
Isn't that about all there is to do?

2250
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:22,960
Really?

2251
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,900
I'm a bit surprised.

2252
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:25,460
I thought you'd be more into girly stuff.

2253
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:26,600
Gyaru poi!

2254
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:31,140
So true!

2255
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:33,160
What do you mean girly stuff?

2256
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:33,780
Gyaru stuff?

2257
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:36,380
Doesn't everyone watch anime and read manga?

2258
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,600
She's a keeper.

2259
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,260
What do you mean girly stuff?

2260
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:40,740
Gyaru stuff?

2261
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:42,240
She's just doing what she wants to do.

2262
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:45,480
She's just doing what she wants to do.

2263
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:45,880
She's so great.

2264
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,460
She's so good.

2265
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,980
Rin-chan!

2266
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:54,720
I don't care if something's girls or whatever.

2267
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:56,600
I just do what I want to do.

2268
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:58,560
You're right.

2269
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,280
It's not good to make assumptions like that.

2270
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:01,300
Sorry, Rin-chan.

2271
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:04,240
No, I'm sorry.

2272
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:06,760
I was just reflecting on what you said.

2273
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,260
Do you think Rin likes girls?

2274
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:10,220
Asking for myself.

2275
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,080
If she does, we're both in luck.

2276
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,520
No, I'm sorry.

2277
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,000
I shouldn't have said it like that.

2278
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,840
I don't blame you for thinking I was mad at you.

2279
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:27,300
She's so real.

2280
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:28,800
This is the route, Mint.

2281
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:29,460
I know!

2282
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:29,960
I know!

2283
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:36,020
I didn't mean to sound like I was accusing you of anything.

2284
01:48:36,260 --> 01:48:36,740
I didn't mean to sound like I was accusing you of anything.

2285
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,040
But to be honest, I like making assumptions about other people as well.

2286
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:40,500
What do you think about me?

2287
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:43,580
You're so serious, so I was wondering what you were doing.

2288
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:48,120
She's got such good fashion sense.

2289
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:50,680
I wish she was the blue character, though.

2290
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:52,360
Like, you know, I wish she was wearing blue.

2291
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:56,800
I'll think things like, this guy seems serious.

2292
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,240
He does... he probably does this and that.

2293
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,780
Wow, you're so lame.

2294
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:01,780
I'm sorry.

2295
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:06,780
Even though I don't want to do it myself, I'm doing it for others.

2296
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:08,820
No, it's okay.

2297
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:12,440
I'm pretty dumb, huh?

2298
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:15,940
I don't like it when people do it to me, but like, I still do it to others.

2299
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:18,920
No one's perfect.

2300
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:20,920
You gotta work it.

2301
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:24,620
I love her hair.

2302
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:25,940
She's so cute.

2303
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,520
It's kinda like mine.

2304
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:31,020
Maybe I should wear a side pony.

2305
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,500
I'm kind of inspired right now.

2306
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,840
Her hair is like mine, just different colors.

2307
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,440
But I'd better stop.

2308
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,480
Like, treat others like you'd want to be treated.

2309
01:49:43,660 --> 01:49:44,940
That's what my grandma always said.

2310
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:46,340
She was definitely right.

2311
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:49,640
So, in order to stop, it's important to know your partner well.

2312
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:54,980
So, let's get to know you first.

2313
01:49:55,580 --> 01:49:56,600
He's just like me.

2314
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:01,520
The best way to stop is to learn more about other people.

2315
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,180
So, I'll start with you, Hai-chan.

2316
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:04,320
Me?

2317
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:08,720
By the way, what kind of person do you think I am?

2318
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:09,620
At this stage?

2319
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:15,520
Hmm... I guess I'm someone who made a mistake at work and got fired from the company.

2320
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:18,740
It's no good, isn't it?

2321
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,400
Decisions and prejudices...

2322
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,340
Oof.

2323
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:23,240
Oof.

2324
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:23,980
Right now?

2325
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:27,220
You're like the kind of person who screwed up and got fired?

2326
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:28,280
No.

2327
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,200
I can't let myself make assumptions.

2328
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,000
I need to fix my view.

2329
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:34,300
It's not an assumption.

2330
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:35,540
It's just the truth.

2331
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:39,420
So, no matter how much we get to know each other, it won't change.

2332
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:40,980
Wow.

2333
01:50:41,180 --> 01:50:42,040
Is it already this late?

2334
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,240
I'm going to go back really sad and embarrassed.

2335
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:45,360
Time to go home.

2336
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:49,960
Thank you for today.

2337
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:51,260
Please come again.

2338
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:53,240
Bye-bye.

2339
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:54,980
Thanks for everything.

2340
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,060
See you later.

2341
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,600
I got to drink some delicious alcohol and have fun conversations.

2342
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:03,160
Now I'm motivated for work.

2343
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:08,840
Sunday... Hmm...

2344
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:12,460
Oh, wait.

2345
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:12,900
Oh, sorry.

2346
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:13,660
This one.

2347
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:15,220
Let's gamble it.

2348
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:15,940
I'm warning gamble.

2349
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,200
Oh, big boss.

2350
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:18,880
Big boss.

2351
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:19,320
Big boss.

2352
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:19,760
Big boss.

2353
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:20,180
Big boss.

2354
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:20,340
Big boss.

2355
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:20,700
Big boss.

2356
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:21,460
Boss.

2357
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:21,900
Boss.

2358
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:22,360
Boss.

2359
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:22,600
Boss.

2360
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:23,480
Thank you for your boss.

2361
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:24,080
Thank you.

2362
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:24,660
Boss.

2363
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:25,200
Boss.

2364
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:25,800
Boss.

2365
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:26,860
Boss!

2366
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:31,340
Good.

2367
01:51:49,110 --> 01:51:49,510
Yeah.

2368
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:50,390
No, you guys.

2369
01:51:50,450 --> 01:51:51,590
I didn't save on purpose.

2370
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:53,570
Because...

2371
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:56,990
Because...

2372
01:51:57,610 --> 01:51:58,970
This is real life.

2373
01:51:59,190 --> 01:51:59,470
Okay?

2374
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:03,110
This is real life.

2375
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:03,990
Keep rolling.

2376
01:52:05,250 --> 01:52:06,070
Okay, one more.

2377
01:52:07,330 --> 01:52:08,770
Just one more.

2378
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:12,630
I wonder what the eyes sparklies mean.

2379
01:52:12,870 --> 01:52:13,870
If they mean anything.

2380
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:21,650
Oh, it's only 800 yen.

2381
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:22,710
One more.

2382
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:27,670
Give me the jackpot.

2383
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:28,550
Please.

2384
01:52:28,710 --> 01:52:29,490
Oh, God.

2385
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:30,730
I'm going to lose my house.

2386
01:52:30,990 --> 01:52:31,850
Oh, God.

2387
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:32,570
Oh, God.

2388
01:52:32,570 --> 01:52:33,270
Oh, God.

2389
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:34,190
Please.

2390
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:35,190
The jackpot.

2391
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:38,590
Ah...

2392
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:40,750
Better than nothing.

2393
01:52:55,810 --> 01:52:56,290
Nothing.

2394
01:52:56,290 --> 01:52:56,790
Okay, one more.

2395
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:05,020
Oh, God.

2396
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:05,460
I'm scared.

2397
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:06,540
I can't look.

2398
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:07,100
I can't look.

2399
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:08,640
Touching.

2400
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:13,080
What are these tiny baby amounts?

2401
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:16,800
I mean, not that I'm complaining or anything, but...

2402
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:18,760
One more.

2403
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:19,780
Okay, end on a win.

2404
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:20,860
This is the last one.

2405
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,520
Last one, last one, last one.

2406
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:28,700
By the power of my bunny ears, I manifest money into my wallet!

2407
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:01,270
I think I missed...

2408
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:05,810
Last, last one.

2409
01:54:06,570 --> 01:54:09,150
You guys, I don't think I can... I don't think I can recover.

2410
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:12,010
I actually don't think I can financially recover!

2411
01:54:13,950 --> 01:54:14,910
You're right.

2412
01:54:16,290 --> 01:54:16,890
I am.

2413
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:21,110
This is what it's like when a Rona gives you nine blues and one yellow.

2414
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:01,480
It's over.

2415
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:05,380
It's over for me.

2416
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:11,540
Who wanted to go see the bunny girls anyway?

2417
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,040
You know what, maybe... maybe that girl was wrong.

2418
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:17,900
Maybe my life really is over.

2419
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:26,460
Maybe... maybe... maybe I just should have...

2420
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:37,340
What a crazy dream we saw just then, wasn't it?

2421
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,200
Oh my god.

2422
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,520
You guys, I just had the craziest dream!

2423
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:43,640
I'm so glad I woke up from that.

2424
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:45,800
I just kept gambling and losing and losing and losing.

2425
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:48,300
This is why I quit sports betting.

2426
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:52,280
What did I do?

2427
01:55:54,340 --> 01:55:54,940
Gosh.

2428
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:58,600
Anyway.

2429
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:03,400
I shaved, brushed my teeth, and got the wrinkles out of my clothes.

2430
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:04,520
I'm good.

2431
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:05,760
Let's go into the shop.

2432
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:10,840
I'm all dressed up fancy for them!

2433
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:13,300
Hello, Rin-chan.

2434
01:56:15,320 --> 01:56:16,300
Of course.

2435
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,400
What should we have?

2436
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:24,200
I lost a lot today, so...

2437
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:37,580
And also, I won't save Scub every time, you guys.

2438
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:38,540
Don't worry, don't worry.

2439
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:40,800
That's why I took the first loss, you know?

2440
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:44,440
I'm gonna have a...

2441
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:46,360
A vintage umeshu.

2442
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:48,300
I'm gonna get wasted today.

2443
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:51,780
Because I lost a lot of money.

2444
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:54,560
Yeah, do you want...

2445
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:00,140
Here, you know what?

2446
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:01,060
Let's have the same thing.

2447
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,320
Delicious, delicious.

2448
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:14,480
I like it here.

2449
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:18,960
I don't have a present for her or anything.

2450
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:20,820
Let's just talk.

2451
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,080
What do you do on your days off, Bean-chan?

2452
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:24,420
What do you want?

2453
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:25,680
Do you want to invite me on a date?

2454
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:29,780
You're a meat-eating type, aren't you?

2455
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:32,220
No, no, no, no, no.

2456
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,200
Are you asking me on a date?

2457
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:37,680
You're like pretty aggressive, aren't you, Hai-chan?

2458
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:39,940
That's not what I meant.

2459
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,300
I really am interested.

2460
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:42,180
Is that so?

2461
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:44,760
You're so boring.

2462
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:47,320
Am I not that attractive?

2463
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:49,580
Oh, I think you're very charming.

2464
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:51,600
Of course I do.

2465
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:53,700
I wouldn't come and see you if I didn't.

2466
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:56,220
You're so attractive.

2467
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:57,680
I'm going to get you.

2468
01:57:58,700 --> 01:57:59,580
I mean, I'm going to get you.

2469
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:01,700
I'm going to be a little embarrassed.

2470
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:07,740
It's funny that you think that.

2471
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:10,020
It's so funny that it's actually a little embarrassing.

2472
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:13,260
Thank you.

2473
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:14,900
Oh my gosh, you're so cute.

2474
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:16,020
Thanks.

2475
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,660
So is it my day off?

2476
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,420
On the contrary, what do you think you're doing?

2477
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:25,620
Anyway, you wanted to know about my days off.

2478
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:26,820
Let's spin this around.

2479
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:28,380
What do you think I do?

2480
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:29,560
Oh, okay.

2481
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:30,300
I have to judge her.

2482
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:33,160
I think...

2483
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:36,340
Okay, she said that she watches anime and she plays games.

2484
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,560
So maybe spend time...

2485
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:40,120
Okay, either shopping for clothes or spend time at home, right?

2486
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:42,100
Right?

2487
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:46,920
I think she spends time at home.

2488
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:54,000
Spend time at home.

2489
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:58,260
Oh, you're right.

2490
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,080
That's pretty much it lately.

2491
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:07,980
I've got like a stack of manga and this season's anime to catch up on.

2492
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:09,400
She's so real.

2493
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:18,480
I love her.

2494
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:21,220
She also goes to karaoke by herself.

2495
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,920
I like, went to karaoke in front of the station by myself last weekend.

2496
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:27,440
I sang nothing but the songs that I wanted to sing myself.

2497
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:29,040
She's just like me.

2498
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:34,600
I guess you try to pick the songs that everyone knows when you go with friends.

2499
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:44,140
Literally me.

2500
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,340
I am also very cute.

2501
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:46,400
I believe you.

2502
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:49,240
Yeah.

2503
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:50,880
I like hearing people sing.

2504
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:52,800
But like going with friends is fun too.

2505
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,820
Oh wait, so going with friends is fun too.

2506
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:57,940
But like last weekend, I wanted to sing and blow off steam.

2507
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:03,160
Just like me forever.

2508
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:08,200
What were you doing last weekend, Hai-chan?

2509
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:10,460
Were you making out with girls maybe?

2510
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:11,800
No, I was here.

2511
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:13,840
Obviously not.

2512
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:15,820
I don't even know anyone who would want to.

2513
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:16,740
Don't say that.

2514
02:00:16,740 --> 02:00:17,760
Hai-chan!

2515
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:20,280
You can't do that without a partner.

2516
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,820
Then, I'll do it for you.

2517
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:28,460
Well, actually...

2518
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:31,640
Yeah, I guess you'd need two willing participants for that.

2519
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:34,820
Well then, why don't I act as your partner?

2520
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,120
Here.

2521
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:48,840
I'll blow a kiss to you.

2522
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:51,180
That's all for now.

2523
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:52,740
So hang in there, okay?

2524
02:00:52,740 --> 02:00:52,980
Okay.

2525
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:56,700
Hai-chan, don't you have enough to drink?

2526
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,240
If you don't have enough to drink, I can still get you ready.

2527
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:04,420
Is this what it feels like?

2528
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:07,040
To go to the afterlife one more time?

2529
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:12,380
It's been so long since I knew what it felt like to die.

2530
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:18,350
Goodbye, sweet world.

2531
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:28,020
Umeshu, sounds great.

2532
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:29,180
Umeshu.

2533
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:31,180
Umeshu, right?

2534
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:32,100
I hope I had enough to drink.

2535
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:32,280
Look.

2536
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:33,020
Look at her face.

2537
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,360
She's so cute.

2538
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:35,520
My Goodness.

2539
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:37,820
If you want some more, I can get you some.

2540
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:38,360
Yes.

2541
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:38,780
Okay.

2542
02:01:42,900 --> 02:01:43,580
That's good.

2543
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:45,500
Umeshu.

2544
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:46,020
For me?

2545
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:48,660
Umeshu for you?

2546
02:01:55,030 --> 02:01:59,810
Do you believe in life after afterlife?

2547
02:02:00,670 --> 02:02:04,750
Do you believe in life after life?

2548
02:02:11,790 --> 02:02:14,690
Should we get something to eat?

2549
02:02:17,590 --> 02:02:20,670
I love having... where is the mixed nuts?

2550
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:24,390
Izakaya... or not Izakaya.

2551
02:02:24,450 --> 02:02:26,290
Bars always have the nuts that you can have.

2552
02:02:26,890 --> 02:02:27,610
Right?

2553
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:33,730
Give more fries?

2554
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:35,390
Pizza?

2555
02:02:36,270 --> 02:02:37,950
That's expensive pizza.

2556
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:44,330
She likes pizza?

2557
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:44,810
She does?

2558
02:02:45,490 --> 02:02:47,170
I mean, who doesn't like pizza?

2559
02:02:48,190 --> 02:02:48,630
Okay.

2560
02:02:48,930 --> 02:02:50,830
Well, we're not spending so much money today.

2561
02:02:50,950 --> 02:02:52,190
We just lost a lot of money.

2562
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:53,070
So why not?

2563
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,850
This is my favorite!

2564
02:02:59,910 --> 02:03:00,330
So yummy!

2565
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:11,610
I hate pizza actually.

2566
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:12,350
What?

2567
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:13,530
Why?

2568
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:20,810
Why do you hate pizza?

2569
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:27,070
Are you having fun, Hai-chan?

2570
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:28,250
Is there something you want to do?

2571
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:30,190
I'll listen if there's anything you want to talk about.

2572
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:30,850
Don't hold back.

2573
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:37,470
Mint's streams have taught me that compulsive gambling and good alcohol is the real way to a woman's heart.

2574
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:38,090
Thanks, Mint.

2575
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:39,410
I'll take this knowledge to heart.

2576
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:42,570
Oh, um, uh, yup.

2577
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:44,190
I'm here to help you learn.

2578
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:48,290
You're being pretty assertive today, Rin-chan.

2579
02:03:48,490 --> 02:03:49,250
What's going on?

2580
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,950
She's drunk.

2581
02:03:56,210 --> 02:03:59,770
I thought I should try harder to starve my costar- well, serve.

2582
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:19,920
Sorry.

2583
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:24,460
Sorry if I read it wrong.

2584
02:04:28,230 --> 02:04:32,750
I thought I should try harder to serve my costar.

2585
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:33,050
I thought I should try harder to serve my costar.

2586
02:04:34,350 --> 02:04:37,510
That's what they call good service, you know?

2587
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:45,550
She's so awesome.

2588
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:51,050
She's so awesome!

2589
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:53,670
She cares about me, you guys!

2590
02:04:53,890 --> 02:04:55,150
I'm not parasocial!

2591
02:04:55,270 --> 02:04:56,470
She cares about me!

2592
02:04:58,050 --> 02:04:59,350
I mean, think about it.

2593
02:04:59,410 --> 02:05:02,230
You're spending your own hard-earned money to talk to me.

2594
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:13,930
I'm not parasocial!

2595
02:05:13,930 --> 02:05:13,930
She cares about me, you guys!

2596
02:05:13,930 --> 02:05:13,930
I'm not parasocial!

2597
02:05:13,930 --> 02:05:14,530
She's so good!

2598
02:05:16,990 --> 02:05:18,870
She cares about me!

2599
02:05:22,090 --> 02:05:22,870
It's money!

2600
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:23,430
Money!

2601
02:05:23,630 --> 02:05:26,370
Money that's valued equally all over the world!

2602
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:27,830
I know I'm so- stop it!

2603
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:30,710
And you're using that money to come see me, right?

2604
02:05:34,690 --> 02:05:36,530
Are you actually trying to tell us something, Mint?

2605
02:05:36,610 --> 02:05:40,090
Is your maid cafe actually a place to starve customers to turn you into a wuss?

2606
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:41,710
No!

2607
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:42,750
Why would you think that?

2608
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:56,000
It's pretty crazy, right?

2609
02:05:56,180 --> 02:06:00,200
I can't just half-ass things now that I've realized how far people are willing to go for me.

2610
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:02,580
I know I've bought her macarons, I've bought her perfume...

2611
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:04,560
So that's why you're pushing harder today.

2612
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:07,860
But to be honest, I prefer your usual style of service, Rin-chan.

2613
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:14,480
What is going on?

2614
02:06:15,020 --> 02:06:15,540
Money!

2615
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:16,900
Starve me, boss!

2616
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:17,280
No!

2617
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:20,500
Are you kidding?

2618
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:23,380
My usual style is just me, like, goofing off!

2619
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:26,660
I've never even been consciously providing service until now!

2620
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:29,000
This pose is so goofy.

2621
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:35,520
Instead of yourself, let me entertain you.

2622
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:42,340
I can't just accept a paycheck for doing that, can I?

2623
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:45,260
I need to make sure that I'm entertaining you, too.

2624
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:46,080
Not just myself.

2625
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:49,380
Hey, if you're having fun, then I'm having fun, too.

2626
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:52,700
In fact, it wouldn't be as fun for me if you just started fussing over me.

2627
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:54,040
Hmm...

2628
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:55,340
Yeah, you're right.

2629
02:06:55,580 --> 02:06:57,000
I don't like being taken care of.

2630
02:06:58,460 --> 02:06:58,860
True.

2631
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,200
It's not easy to relax when someone's fussing over you, huh?

2632
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:04,280
Well, then I guess I'll just do what I usually do.

2633
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:08,220
I'm going to buy her a big present next week.

2634
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:13,500
Well, should I just act normal, then?

2635
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:15,240
That'd be easier and more fun for me, too.

2636
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:16,120
Sure.

2637
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:18,820
I like you bust when you act like you usually do, Rin-chan.

2638
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,380
You're plenty charming just the way you are, okay?

2639
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:25,120
We got... we got some... we got some good points.

2640
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:26,380
Yeah!

2641
02:07:26,700 --> 02:07:27,100
Yeah!

2642
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:30,420
We're pretty coo- Don't say it with a straight face!

2643
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:32,520
She's so cute!

2644
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:38,280
That's embarrassing!

2645
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:40,380
Don't say that with such a straight face!

2646
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:42,060
I hope I'll be able to look you in the eye!

2647
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:43,640
Oh, she's so cute!

2648
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:44,980
It starves us!

2649
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:46,600
I want to become an internal customer!

2650
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:57,060
Well, I'm not...

2651
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:58,780
I don't have to force myself to eat anything.

2652
02:07:59,200 --> 02:07:59,640
All right!

2653
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:01,360
Let's keep going!

2654
02:08:01,980 --> 02:08:02,580
Yeah!

2655
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:03,260
How does it taste?

2656
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:04,960
Let's have...

2657
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:07,240
What's her favorite, I wonder?

2658
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:08,280
Can I have some too?

2659
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:10,400
I'm going to get drunk-drunk.

2660
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:15,180
This is delicious, isn't it?

2661
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:18,220
Flesh and gyaru are very effective.

2662
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:24,020
Thank you!

2663
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:26,740
I'm being fed so well tonight.

2664
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:27,640
Itadakimasu!

2665
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:32,480
Have you realized you can control the camera when she reaches for your drink?

2666
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,000
There's a zoom?

2667
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:37,380
I didn't know when he told me this before.

2668
02:08:44,860 --> 02:08:45,520
It's a zoom?

2669
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:46,900
Wait, is this real?

2670
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:47,160
Really?

2671
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:50,680
Do you have a phone, Hai-chan?

2672
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:52,940
Are there any apps you spend a lot of time on?

2673
02:08:55,380 --> 02:08:57,340
You got games on your phone?

2674
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:01,940
But I don't gamble or anything.

2675
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:04,820
It's real?

2676
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:08,140
We've been telling you?

2677
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:09,500
I haven't seen!

2678
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:12,120
What do you mean, we've been telling you?

2679
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:15,280
I'm playing the game!

2680
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:20,560
You mean like, are there any games or anything I'd recommend?

2681
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:21,280
That's right.

2682
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:23,160
But I don't care about games anymore.

2683
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:25,940
I'm still being chased by my day-to-day life.

2684
02:09:25,940 --> 02:09:28,560
If I increase the number of games, I won't be able to enjoy them.

2685
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:31,260
Yeah, but I don't need any more games.

2686
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:34,640
I still have my daily routine.

2687
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:36,040
I won't have fun if I do more.

2688
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:38,460
Something other than games, huh?

2689
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:42,300
Wait, I have it.

2690
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:43,700
A map app?

2691
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:46,160
Doesn't every phone have that?

2692
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:47,900
A photo editing app.

2693
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:49,860
She might like that, right?

2694
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:51,980
Hmm...

2695
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:54,280
Hmm...

2696
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:55,080
Hmm...

2697
02:09:57,380 --> 02:09:58,660
The day alias.

2698
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:03,760
I don't know.

2699
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:05,020
She might like this, though.

2700
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:06,100
Photo editing app.

2701
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:06,740
Ah, right.

2702
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:08,380
There are many people who use it by taking selfies.

2703
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:12,640
I tried it once, but it was a pain in the ass.

2704
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:17,440
She's not into the typical things a gyaru would be into.

2705
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:20,580
You know, when you think of a gyaru.

2706
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:24,380
It's just like shopping and makeup and everything like that.

2707
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:26,180
I mean, I'm sure she's into it, but like...

2708
02:10:26,180 --> 02:10:28,320
You know, they are always heavily editing their stuff.

2709
02:10:28,700 --> 02:10:29,660
Yeah, no Riz.

2710
02:10:30,380 --> 02:10:32,240
A lot of people use this when they take selfies.

2711
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,300
I tried using one once, but it was a pain to use.

2712
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:34,760
I give up.

2713
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:40,040
It's okay, I'll buy her another pizza.

2714
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:42,100
Hai-chan, did you know?

2715
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:45,080
People back in the day didn't have phones at all.

2716
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:46,400
Isn't that amazing?

2717
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:50,280
I don't have the confidence to live without a smartphone.

2718
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:52,540
Isn't that crazy?

2719
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:54,360
I don't think I could survive if I didn't have a smartphone.

2720
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:55,100
I have it on my phone.

2721
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:57,060
Yeah, me too.

2722
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:59,200
Once you get used to having one, you just can't give it up.

2723
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:01,780
She's so cute.

2724
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:07,240
Exactly.

2725
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:10,560
Maybe once you get used to me, you won't be able to give me up either?

2726
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:16,380
If I get too into you, I might just want to keep you all to myself.

2727
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:18,160
Hai-chan!

2728
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:21,540
It's okay if you become one.

2729
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:23,420
Just be yourself.

2730
02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:26,460
If you don't have me, you can't live without me.

2731
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:28,620
That's great!

2732
02:11:30,930 --> 02:11:31,810
Are we?

2733
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:34,510
We're like seriously flirting, aren't we?

2734
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:38,470
Why don't you then?

2735
02:11:38,570 --> 02:11:39,430
In fact, you should.

2736
02:11:39,650 --> 02:11:41,190
Make it so you can't live without me.

2737
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:42,670
Yeah, that'd be great.

2738
02:11:45,170 --> 02:11:48,510
So, from now on, keep getting more and more into me.

2739
02:11:50,370 --> 02:11:52,890
So from now on, keep getting more and more into me.

2740
02:11:52,890 --> 02:11:53,850
So from now on, keep getting more and more into me.

2741
02:11:54,290 --> 02:11:54,850
Okay?

2742
02:11:58,870 --> 02:11:59,990
I'll do

2743
02:12:05,580 --> 02:12:07,360
my best too.

2744
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:07,940
Here.

2745
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:09,800
I love you, love you, Hai-chan.

2746
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:12,080
Come see me more.

2747
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:16,700
Wow, is it already this...

2748
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:17,540
No, Hai-chan!

2749
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:20,960
No, you are in!

2750
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:21,940
Don't go!

2751
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:31,760
You idiot!

2752
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:35,980
Come see me again.

2753
02:12:35,980 --> 02:12:36,740
I'll be waiting.

2754
02:12:40,290 --> 02:12:41,370
Thanks for today.

2755
02:12:41,650 --> 02:12:42,350
Bye-bye.

2756
02:12:43,990 --> 02:12:45,070
I can't believe it.

2757
02:12:45,610 --> 02:12:47,230
I'm motivated for work.

2758
02:12:49,350 --> 02:12:50,850
There are so many things to do.

2759
02:12:51,030 --> 02:12:51,710
What?

2760
02:12:54,190 --> 02:12:55,190
Woo-hoo!

2761
02:12:57,150 --> 02:12:58,390
Woo-hoo-hoo!

2762
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:12,590
Uwa-ha-ha-ha.

2763
02:13:12,750 --> 02:13:15,550
Uwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

2764
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:17,150
Oh!

2765
02:13:21,210 --> 02:13:22,830
Oh, 700 yen.

2766
02:13:24,650 --> 02:13:26,510
This is better than losing!

2767
02:13:27,330 --> 02:13:28,070
Woo-hoo!

2768
02:13:31,910 --> 02:13:33,590
I mean, it's technically a win.

2769
02:13:34,090 --> 02:13:34,690
Hold on.

2770
02:13:34,830 --> 02:13:36,150
What stuff do we have in here?

2771
02:13:37,450 --> 02:13:38,730
Nothing has changed yet.

2772
02:13:39,530 --> 02:13:42,330
I think it's time to buy her the bouquet of roses.

2773
02:13:43,310 --> 02:13:44,790
The bouquet of...

2774
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:46,010
Or, yeah.

2775
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:47,190
The bouquet...

2776
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:47,950
Well, maybe she...

2777
02:13:47,950 --> 02:13:49,110
She probably likes snacks.

2778
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:49,990
Pajamas?

2779
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:51,870
She probably would like pajamas a lot, right?

2780
02:13:51,870 --> 02:13:51,990
All right.

2781
02:13:54,390 --> 02:13:55,730
Seven dollars is seven dollars.

2782
02:13:55,850 --> 02:13:56,210
Exactly.

2783
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:03,380
Because she likes to stay at home, right?

2784
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:07,160
Okay.

2785
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:09,260
If I win this next one, I'll buy her the pajamas.

2786
02:14:13,390 --> 02:14:13,750
Pajamas.

2787
02:14:13,910 --> 02:14:14,270
Pajamas.

2788
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:14,830
Pajamas.

2789
02:14:14,930 --> 02:14:15,290
Pajamas.

2790
02:14:15,830 --> 02:14:16,190
Pajamas.

2791
02:14:16,750 --> 02:14:17,110
Pajamas.

2792
02:14:17,630 --> 02:14:17,990
Pajamas.

2793
02:14:18,010 --> 02:14:18,310
Pajamas.

2794
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:18,370
Pajamas.

2795
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:18,810
Pajamas.

2796
02:14:18,930 --> 02:14:19,050
Pajamas.

2797
02:14:19,970 --> 02:14:20,330
Pajamas.

2798
02:14:24,990 --> 02:14:25,490
Why

2799
02:14:40,300 --> 02:14:41,500
does this keep happening to me?

2800
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:45,340
Why does this keep happening to me, you guys?

2801
02:14:46,940 --> 02:14:47,440
Wait.

2802
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:50,540
What the...

2803
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:51,920
Oh, that is such a big amount of money.

2804
02:14:55,660 --> 02:14:56,160
Load.

2805
02:15:01,150 --> 02:15:01,910
Crazy dream.

2806
02:15:06,030 --> 02:15:08,870
Anyway... I'm buying her pajamas.

2807
02:15:13,630 --> 02:15:14,830
We gotta get in.

2808
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:18,010
I shaved, brushed my teeth, and got the wrinkles out of my clothes.

2809
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:19,270
Let's go into the shop.

2810
02:15:22,690 --> 02:15:23,350
She's here.

2811
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:23,890
Thank goodness.

2812
02:15:29,150 --> 02:15:29,590
Yeah!

2813
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:34,290
Our usual...

2814
02:15:36,530 --> 02:15:37,710
I'll get the umeshu.

2815
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:38,550
I don't think...

2816
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:42,050
Me, even getting drunk, maybe she's more like...

2817
02:15:42,050 --> 02:15:45,570
Like, you know, love you with me if we're drunk, you know?

2818
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:52,670
Maybe we take more risks too because we get drunk, right?

2819
02:15:55,270 --> 02:15:57,510
But I think we're gonna give her the bunny punch.

2820
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:01,840
This is delicious.

2821
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:12,710
It's like... I pay so much more and I still get the same show.

2822
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:14,830
Itadakimasu.

2823
02:16:16,190 --> 02:16:17,750
Pajamas made out of 100% cotton.

2824
02:16:17,930 --> 02:16:18,930
I have this for you.

2825
02:16:20,410 --> 02:16:22,710
If it's okay, would you be willing to accept this?

2826
02:16:23,110 --> 02:16:23,510
Are you sure?

2827
02:16:24,930 --> 02:16:25,450
Thank you.

2828
02:16:26,450 --> 02:16:27,170
Oh, the E!

2829
02:16:27,190 --> 02:16:27,570
I forgot!

2830
02:16:28,230 --> 02:16:29,190
I'll get it next time.

2831
02:16:30,890 --> 02:16:31,690
Sorry, guys.

2832
02:16:33,570 --> 02:16:34,850
Are you into me, Hai-chan?

2833
02:16:35,450 --> 02:16:36,970
Hai-chan, do you like me?

2834
02:16:38,250 --> 02:16:39,950
Are you talking about me, Hai-chan?

2835
02:16:40,130 --> 02:16:41,230
Am I your favorite?

2836
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:47,070
Sorry, I'll get the... I gotta get the big bottle and zoom in, you know?

2837
02:16:49,410 --> 02:16:50,790
What makes you think that?

2838
02:16:51,230 --> 02:16:53,530
It's not like I bought you so many presents or anything.

2839
02:16:53,810 --> 02:16:56,110
Well, you came to see me.

2840
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:56,330
I know you like me.

2841
02:16:58,050 --> 02:16:59,790
Well, I'd be embarrassed if I misunderstood you.

2842
02:17:03,230 --> 02:17:05,750
I mean, you've been coming to see me pretty often.

2843
02:17:06,050 --> 02:17:07,450
I'm sorry if I got the wrong idea.

2844
02:17:07,630 --> 02:17:08,610
It's a bit embarrassing.

2845
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:11,950
You don't have the wrong idea.

2846
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:13,850
I enjoy talking to you, Rin-chan.

2847
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:16,070
Be honest, yeah.

2848
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:16,670
Really?

2849
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:20,190
Then, do you remember what you talked to me about?

2850
02:17:21,570 --> 02:17:24,050
In that case, can you remember what we've talked about?

2851
02:17:24,210 --> 02:17:24,390
Oh!

2852
02:17:24,390 --> 02:17:24,390
You know,

2853
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:38,310
we chatted about what I did on my days off, right?

2854
02:17:38,430 --> 02:17:40,510
You can't remember all the little details, can you?

2855
02:17:42,510 --> 02:17:42,990
Oh!

2856
02:17:42,990 --> 02:17:46,670
Combine words while remembering previous conversations.

2857
02:17:47,110 --> 02:17:48,970
Women don't like men who don't remember.

2858
02:17:50,150 --> 02:17:54,210
Um, you karaoke... sorry, karaoke?

2859
02:17:54,210 --> 02:17:54,370
Karaoke?

2860
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:54,530
Karaoke?

2861
02:17:55,950 --> 02:17:56,710
Karaoke?

2862
02:17:58,130 --> 02:17:59,330
By herself?

2863
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:01,530
With her cat?

2864
02:18:01,830 --> 02:18:02,610
That'd be awesome.

2865
02:18:03,150 --> 02:18:03,910
Karaoke?

2866
02:18:04,130 --> 02:18:05,270
In front of the station!

2867
02:18:07,630 --> 02:18:08,390
Jeopardy!

2868
02:18:11,030 --> 02:18:11,410
Good.

2869
02:18:12,490 --> 02:18:14,470
You really remember me.

2870
02:18:16,010 --> 02:18:16,990
I'm so happy.

2871
02:18:18,610 --> 02:18:20,110
What should I do?

2872
02:18:21,210 --> 02:18:21,970
Karaoke!

2873
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:28,600
You guys, we did good.

2874
02:18:28,720 --> 02:18:29,460
We did good.

2875
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:31,320
You really do remember.

2876
02:18:31,580 --> 02:18:32,580
Wow, that's crazy.

2877
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:34,540
I'm like, so genuinely happy.

2878
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:35,480
What should I do?

2879
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:36,720
Yabai.

2880
02:18:37,140 --> 02:18:38,860
Atashi, chotto uzaku nakatta.

2881
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:41,860
Jibun no koto okini deshou, toka.

2882
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:44,180
Kaiwa oboeteru, toka.

2883
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:45,600
Crap.

2884
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:47,520
Was I acting kinda clingy just now?

2885
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:49,240
Like, asking if I'm your fave?

2886
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,620
And about past conversations?

2887
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:52,240
Sonna no.

2888
02:18:52,580 --> 02:18:54,020
Nanka arejan ne.

2889
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:55,560
Jishiki kawanae.

2890
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:56,340
We're going in.

2891
02:18:57,940 --> 02:18:58,880
Let's go to karaoke with Rin-chan.

2892
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,620
Yeah, let's go to karaoke with Rin-chan.

2893
02:19:01,940 --> 02:19:03,960
I really didn't mean it like that at all.

2894
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:07,420
But I can't help it if you think I'm cringe and too self-conscious.

2895
02:19:07,660 --> 02:19:08,640
Nyaa, cringe.

2896
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:13,220
I don't think of you that way at all.

2897
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:21,260
Are you sure you should be saying that?

2898
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:22,940
I get carried away sometimes, you know.

2899
02:19:22,940 --> 02:19:27,280
If I wasn't okay with that, I wouldn't come to visit you, Rin-chan.

2900
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:34,380
Then, I'll make you my favorite too, Hai-chan.

2901
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,940
So, from now on, let's meet properly.

2902
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:40,060
She doesn't say that to everybody, you guys.

2903
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:41,020
She's only saying that to me.

2904
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:43,480
She doesn't say that to everybody, you guys.

2905
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:44,220
She only says that to me.

2906
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:45,780
I'm her favorite now.

2907
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:48,880
In that case, I'll make you my fave too.

2908
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,700
So you better keep coming to see me, okay?

2909
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:53,860
Where's...

2910
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:57,200
What should I

2911
02:20:02,030 --> 02:20:03,170
do?

2912
02:20:04,450 --> 02:20:05,490
Of course.

2913
02:20:06,070 --> 02:20:07,510
Would you like to go out with me for a drink?

2914
02:20:08,110 --> 02:20:11,230
Oh dang, time like totally flies when I'm with you, Hai-chan.

2915
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:12,250
What should we do?

2916
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:14,510
Will you stay with me for a few more rounds?

2917
02:20:16,530 --> 02:20:17,630
I'm so whipped.

2918
02:20:18,010 --> 02:20:19,930
Alright, let's continue.

2919
02:20:20,950 --> 02:20:21,850
Let's continue.

2920
02:20:22,390 --> 02:20:23,090
What do you want to drink?

2921
02:20:24,610 --> 02:20:27,890
I'm gonna get... Okay, I'm gonna get something cheap for me.

2922
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:32,130
We're gonna get the oolong highball.

2923
02:20:34,070 --> 02:20:36,010
Because we're gonna get the bottle for her.

2924
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,020
Easy to get drunk.

2925
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:44,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2926
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:46,000
Cheap for me.

2927
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:48,240
I know the zoom.

2928
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:48,980
I know the zoom.

2929
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:49,520
I know the zoom.

2930
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:50,520
That's why I'm getting the bottle.

2931
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:53,780
Of course.

2932
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:55,700
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

2933
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:57,460
Seriously?

2934
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:58,020
Yes!

2935
02:20:58,700 --> 02:20:59,420
I'll go get the bottle.

2936
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:01,300
Okay, here we go.

2937
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:01,620
Zoom.

2938
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:02,600
Zoom.

2939
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:05,260
How do I go down?

2940
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:06,040
Oh wait.

2941
02:21:06,660 --> 02:21:07,220
Control.

2942
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:07,960
Control.

2943
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:08,320
Control.

2944
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:09,160
Here you go.

2945
02:21:32,910 --> 02:21:33,470
Automatically...

2946
02:21:35,310 --> 02:21:36,750
Just a glimpse.

2947
02:21:37,150 --> 02:21:38,590
I'm teasing you guys.

2948
02:21:38,710 --> 02:21:39,790
I'm teasing you guys.

2949
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:43,190
I'm teasing you guys.

2950
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:45,290
Oh, I wanna go on vacation.

2951
02:21:45,990 --> 02:21:46,470
Wait.

2952
02:21:46,890 --> 02:21:48,230
Is she gonna invite me?

2953
02:21:48,510 --> 02:21:49,450
That sounds nice.

2954
02:21:49,650 --> 02:21:50,550
Where would you wanna go?

2955
02:21:50,710 --> 02:21:52,090
A hot spring or maybe somewhere overseas?

2956
02:21:52,590 --> 02:21:53,310
I wonder if it's a holy place.

2957
02:21:57,350 --> 02:22:01,010
You guys, she's so perfect.

2958
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:04,350
I wanna go to like a nerd pilgrimage.

2959
02:22:05,470 --> 02:22:09,070
I could visit places that inspired settings in anime and manga.

2960
02:22:09,370 --> 02:22:10,450
She's so good.

2961
02:22:10,450 --> 02:22:11,970
She's so good.

2962
02:22:13,190 --> 02:22:14,770
Yeah, I've heard of that sort of thing.

2963
02:22:14,910 --> 02:22:17,390
Some small towns have been revitalized because of it, right?

2964
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:26,270
Perfect for Mint.

2965
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:29,950
I shouldn't... I misjudged her so much.

2966
02:22:30,330 --> 02:22:31,670
She's so perfect.

2967
02:22:32,530 --> 02:22:33,670
She's so good.

2968
02:22:34,850 --> 02:22:39,430
In some places, the producers and local governments cooperate for collaboration events and stuff.

2969
02:22:39,430 --> 02:22:40,750
I wanna go.

2970
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:43,770
Hai-chan, you wanna go with me?

2971
02:22:44,070 --> 02:22:45,190
I really wanna go.

2972
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:46,850
Will you come with me, Hai-chan?

2973
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:51,550
I'm interested, but it won't be as fun if I don't know the anime, will it?

2974
02:22:51,850 --> 02:22:52,450
That's true.

2975
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:55,970
That's why I'm looking forward to anime collaborations.

2976
02:22:57,370 --> 02:22:59,850
Hai-chan, you just have to enjoy me.

2977
02:23:00,750 --> 02:23:02,350
You gotta take her to Hinamizawa.

2978
02:23:04,370 --> 02:23:05,150
Oh my gosh.

2979
02:23:05,330 --> 02:23:06,950
Bin-chan with Hinamizawa syndrome?

2980
02:23:07,510 --> 02:23:08,570
Oh la la.

2981
02:23:08,570 --> 02:23:13,290
In that case, I'll enjoy the anime collabs and you can enjoy...

2982
02:23:16,230 --> 02:23:17,130
What's that mean?

2983
02:23:17,330 --> 02:23:18,450
What do you mean by that?

2984
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:24,410
What do you mean?

2985
02:23:27,910 --> 02:23:29,390
What do you mean?

2986
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:30,510
Enjoy you.

2987
02:23:30,810 --> 02:23:31,710
Enjoy you.

2988
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:32,470
Enjoy you.

2989
02:23:33,170 --> 02:23:33,770
Enjoy you.

2990
02:23:37,930 --> 02:23:38,550
Enjoy you.

2991
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:40,990
I can enjoy the anime collabs and you can enjoy the anime collabs.

2992
02:23:41,490 --> 02:23:41,890
Ah...

2993
02:23:44,450 --> 02:23:45,250
I see.

2994
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:46,670
That's right.

2995
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:52,890
Like, you can enjoy looking at my smiling face while I eat yummy food.

2996
02:23:53,090 --> 02:23:56,110
And you can feel my excitement while I buy all the anime merch.

2997
02:23:58,070 --> 02:23:59,290
So that's what you meant.

2998
02:23:59,690 --> 02:24:01,970
Going on a trip with you sounds like a lot of fun, Ninjan.

2999
02:24:01,970 --> 02:24:05,390
Are you expecting something bad?

3000
02:24:06,730 --> 02:24:08,690
You can't imagine that when you're traveling alone.

3001
02:24:14,530 --> 02:24:17,570
Were you thinking that I meant something naughty?

3002
02:24:17,830 --> 02:24:20,810
I guess you would imagine that if we were traveling alone.

3003
02:24:23,730 --> 02:24:25,010
No, I didn't.

3004
02:24:25,050 --> 02:24:27,330
I was picturing a normal, wholesome trip.

3005
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:33,030
Really?

3006
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:35,330
In that case, I feel kind of defeated.

3007
02:24:36,730 --> 02:24:37,870
Calls for more celebration.

3008
02:24:50,690 --> 02:24:53,910
Well, we need to get to know each other better before we go on a trip.

3009
02:24:54,170 --> 02:24:55,730
Let's put the idea on hold for now.

3010
02:24:58,010 --> 02:25:01,410
Take her to Uji and go sit on the Kumiko bench?

3011
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:14,790
I'm an otaku!

3012
02:25:17,370 --> 02:25:20,730
But you know, I really wish I had someone to enjoy otaku stuff with.

3013
02:25:20,830 --> 02:25:24,630
It's fun by myself, but it'd be even better to share it with someone.

3014
02:25:27,970 --> 02:25:30,910
I wonder if she's not around...

3015
02:25:30,910 --> 02:25:32,530
I wonder if she's not around...

3016
02:25:32,530 --> 02:25:36,050
Someone who understands my interests, and enjoys sharing them with me...

3017
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:37,010
I'm here!

3018
02:25:40,910 --> 02:25:42,410
Isn't there anyone out there?

3019
02:25:42,530 --> 02:25:45,510
Anyone who understands my hobbies and will enjoy it with me?

3020
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:46,450
Oh my god.

3021
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:52,630
She's playing with my heart, you guys.

3022
02:25:53,190 --> 02:25:55,070
Need Ruan het wife.

3023
02:25:55,070 --> 02:25:55,210
Wife.

3024
02:25:56,350 --> 02:25:57,350
So true.

3025
02:25:57,850 --> 02:25:59,930
So true, she's so perfect.

3026
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:07,290
Let's battle again.

3027
02:26:09,930 --> 02:26:12,070
Let's just go for the Ome show again.

3028
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:22,680
Rin was born for mint.

3029
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:24,720
She's just like me.

3030
02:26:30,690 --> 02:26:32,450
Sorry, I clicked out of the game on accident.

3031
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:34,270
I

3032
02:26:38,230 --> 02:26:40,790
clicked out of the game on accident.

3033
02:26:41,070 --> 02:26:43,330
It paused.

3034
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:47,850
I like the sound effect that it makes.

3035
02:26:51,570 --> 02:26:53,190
I'm gonna get demonetized.

3036
02:26:57,230 --> 02:26:57,710
Conversation.

3037
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:04,590
It really was on accident.

3038
02:27:09,750 --> 02:27:11,150
We can't do it anymore.

3039
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:11,990
I just can't.

3040
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:12,670
Please, Hai-chan.

3041
02:27:17,150 --> 02:27:18,770
What can't you handle?

3042
02:27:27,730 --> 02:27:28,850
I get

3043
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:36,520
it.

3044
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:38,580
I can't stand it anymore.

3045
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:43,680
There's a special edition release of a new anime out.

3046
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:44,960
I want it.

3047
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:47,400
It's got audio commentary from the director.

3048
02:27:47,420 --> 02:27:48,280
The director has a bonus.

3049
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:50,480
I see.

3050
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:52,980
Well, if you want it that badly, why don't you buy it?

3051
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:04,640
Because I already have the regular edition.

3052
02:28:04,940 --> 02:28:07,000
I don't want to buy it again just for the bonus feature.

3053
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:08,180
Oh, Rin-chan.

3054
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:11,860
Rin-chan, are you a novice otaku or what?

3055
02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:16,320
Everybody knows that you buy at least three copies of the things that you love.

3056
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:20,160
Especially, especially for the bonus.

3057
02:28:21,220 --> 02:28:23,620
Rin-chan, this is real.

3058
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:28,320
Yeah, I think we can buy it for her though, right?

3059
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:29,320
From the little rabbit shop.

3060
02:28:35,460 --> 02:28:36,540
Free demonetization, don't know.

3061
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:37,760
Thank you.

3062
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:42,740
But I'm not the type of girl who can just grin and bear it.

3063
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:46,000
If there's something I want, I like can't stop thinking about it.

3064
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,540
Are you the type of girl who can just grin and bear it?

3065
02:28:50,860 --> 02:28:52,700
Are you like that too, Hai-chan?

3066
02:28:52,860 --> 02:28:53,940
Or can you hold back?

3067
02:28:55,080 --> 02:28:57,560
I beg my parents to pay for it?

3068
02:28:57,580 --> 02:28:59,580
No, I can't hold back.

3069
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:01,660
I can't hold back.

3070
02:29:02,180 --> 02:29:03,340
I knew it.

3071
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:03,980
Wait.

3072
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:06,500
I think people who can endure it are amazing.

3073
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:10,420
But if you can't endure it, you'll be destroyed.

3074
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:12,760
Uh-oh.

3075
02:29:12,820 --> 02:29:13,960
She didn't like it.

3076
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:14,660
We have no riz.

3077
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:16,580
I just wanted to be relatable to her.

3078
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:18,060
Oh no.

3079
02:29:19,660 --> 02:29:20,060
No.

3080
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:22,880
Oopsie.

3081
02:29:25,780 --> 02:29:28,220
Is this really the best answer to a hostess?

3082
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:31,320
It's the best answer, I feel like.

3083
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:36,480
Because if, say, she is my fixation, then I'm always going to be spending on her.

3084
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:37,540
Right?

3085
02:29:39,080 --> 02:29:39,680
I think.

3086
02:29:40,340 --> 02:29:41,220
That's not how that works.

3087
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:43,360
Anyway.

3088
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:44,700
I knew it.

3089
02:29:44,740 --> 02:29:45,560
I think people who can...

3090
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:46,800
who can are really amazing.

3091
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:49,580
But if you don't hold back sometimes, you'll be broke in no time.

3092
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:50,840
I've decided.

3093
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:52,160
I'll hold back.

3094
02:29:52,980 --> 02:29:54,080
I have the normal version.

3095
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,360
I won't waste it.

3096
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:57,960
She's seeing how weak-willed I am.

3097
02:29:58,260 --> 02:29:58,900
You're right.

3098
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:01,160
I've decided.

3099
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:02,240
I'll hold back for now.

3100
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:03,760
I already have the normal edition.

3101
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:05,180
I won't waste my money.

3102
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:07,780
Oh, I guess you can hold back after all, huh?

3103
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:10,540
At the very least, I'll hold back until the sale starts.

3104
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:11,700
I'll hold back until the sale starts.

3105
02:30:12,640 --> 02:30:13,940
I don't know if it's going to be a sale.

3106
02:30:15,580 --> 02:30:17,560
I'll at least wait until it goes on sale.

3107
02:30:17,740 --> 02:30:19,400
Once it does, I might crack.

3108
02:30:19,980 --> 02:30:20,420
But...

3109
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:23,180
I'm really not good at holding back.

3110
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:25,200
Maybe it's because I'm not greedy.

3111
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:28,200
She wants a financially responsible man.

3112
02:30:28,340 --> 02:30:28,840
You're right.

3113
02:30:28,980 --> 02:30:29,580
You're right.

3114
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:31,900
But I'm really bad.

3115
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:34,460
I really am bad at holding myself back like that.

3116
02:30:34,540 --> 02:30:36,160
Not just with physical things either.

3117
02:30:36,740 --> 02:30:37,500
What else?

3118
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:37,820
Maybe...

3119
02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:39,780
If I can find someone I like...

3120
02:30:40,340 --> 02:30:43,080
Even if that person is super far away...

3121
02:30:43,080 --> 02:30:45,820
If I want to see them, I'll go right away.

3122
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:47,220
Even if it's late at night.

3123
02:30:47,460 --> 02:30:48,140
Oh my god.

3124
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:51,500
I can't wait for the arc when Rin shows up at my house at 3 a.m.

3125
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:54,640
Like if I had someone I liked...

3126
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:56,620
Even if they were super far away...

3127
02:30:56,620 --> 02:30:59,340
If I wanted to see them, I'd go right away.

3128
02:30:59,480 --> 02:31:00,560
Even late at night.

3129
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:02,700
That's amazing.

3130
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:04,460
Have you ever done anything like that before?

3131
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:05,280
No.

3132
02:31:05,580 --> 02:31:06,020
No.

3133
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:07,780
But I'm confident it will happen.

3134
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:08,720
No.

3135
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:09,700
Not yet.

3136
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:11,840
But I'm sure it's the sort of thing I'd do.

3137
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:15,580
I guess you're the type who really devotes themselves to people, huh?

3138
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:18,580
Maybe it's a little different from that.

3139
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:19,500
Hmm...

3140
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:21,780
It's just that I can't go unless I want to see them.

3141
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:24,560
Oh, well, not exactly.

3142
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:27,120
I wouldn't go unless I really wanted to see them.

3143
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:28,020
I see.

3144
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:32,040
If you think about it, I might be a little troublesome.

3145
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:33,300
She's so cute.

3146
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:38,540
Hai-chan, if you fall in love with me, it'll be hard.

3147
02:31:38,540 --> 02:31:38,680
It might be hard.

3148
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:43,080
Thinking about it that way, I guess I'm kind of a pain in the butt.

3149
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:46,360
If you bother me, it'd probably be tough for you too, you know?

3150
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:49,140
Oh, it's getting late.

3151
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:56,020
Haito just leaves.

3152
02:31:56,380 --> 02:31:57,640
I'm like the best part.

3153
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:02,560
Fighting down this guy.

3154
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:04,320
I can't stand him.

3155
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:06,320
I'm motivated.

3156
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:08,520
I'm motivated.

3157
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:11,200
Sunday.

3158
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:33,770
Didn't you guys say that the gambling seems safer?

3159
02:32:35,850 --> 02:32:39,290
Didn't you guys say that the gambling seems safer?

3160
02:32:42,550 --> 02:32:43,750
It's safe!

3161
02:32:44,030 --> 02:32:47,770
Oh my gosh, you guys, we did it!

3162
02:33:06,450 --> 02:33:08,130
We can't vacation yet.

3163
02:33:08,830 --> 02:33:10,530
Look how cute she is though.

3164
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:12,310
Yes, yes, yes.

3165
02:33:12,710 --> 02:33:13,650
They're all cute.

3166
02:33:13,650 --> 02:33:15,250
But Nin-chan.

3167
02:33:15,950 --> 02:33:17,130
Nin-chan now.

3168
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:22,860
They don't have it yet.

3169
02:33:25,300 --> 02:33:26,480
Let's get her some socks.

3170
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:31,260
Oh yeah, let's save too.

3171
02:33:32,460 --> 02:33:32,980
Okay.

3172
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:34,520
Okay.

3173
02:33:34,860 --> 02:33:35,380
Okay.

3174
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:38,220
Here I go!

3175
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:43,180
Now is my time to rest and recover.

3176
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:45,300
This is the only place that can heal my mind.

3177
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:47,500
Healing my mind.

3178
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:49,100
Hello.

3179
02:33:55,480 --> 02:33:56,740
When do we get to like...

3180
02:33:56,740 --> 02:34:00,120
I've seen some stuff where you can take pictures.

3181
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:01,400
I mean, obviously there's the album.

3182
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:04,540
When do I get to take pictures with you?

3183
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:10,180
I just took off my clothes.

3184
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:10,300
I want to drink some with you.

3185
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:14,040
Ah, thanks for the time gift.

3186
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:14,940
Thank you.

3187
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:16,840
Thank you, thank you.

3188
02:34:18,740 --> 02:34:19,660
Nin-chan now!

3189
02:34:19,800 --> 02:34:20,360
Nin-chan now!

3190
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:24,210
Okay, bunny patch.

3191
02:34:24,590 --> 02:34:25,950
This is delicious.

3192
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:32,490
Checkies are first if I remember correctly.

3193
02:34:32,610 --> 02:34:33,890
Okay, should be soon?

3194
02:34:34,130 --> 02:34:34,650
Oh!

3195
02:34:34,650 --> 02:34:35,170
Oh!

3196
02:34:35,170 --> 02:34:35,630
I forgot!

3197
02:34:36,370 --> 02:34:38,710
I forgot about those!

3198
02:34:38,750 --> 02:34:39,150
Zoom!

3199
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:40,070
My bad.

3200
02:34:41,930 --> 02:34:42,310
Present!

3201
02:34:42,770 --> 02:34:43,610
I'll give it to you.

3202
02:34:59,890 --> 02:35:03,830
Picture time is when Rin decides it's picture time.

3203
02:35:03,830 --> 02:35:05,930
So true, she can do whatever she wants.

3204
02:35:06,530 --> 02:35:08,350
You know blood type personality theory?

3205
02:35:08,550 --> 02:35:09,570
That stuff's so ridiculous.

3206
02:35:09,810 --> 02:35:10,490
Do you believe in it?

3207
02:35:11,250 --> 02:35:13,090
I never thought that deeply about it before.

3208
02:35:23,150 --> 02:35:24,530
She a vampire?

3209
02:35:24,890 --> 02:35:25,670
She want my blood?

3210
02:35:26,570 --> 02:35:29,350
Like, you're type A, so you're very methodical.

3211
02:35:29,510 --> 02:35:30,470
It's so dumb.

3212
02:35:30,690 --> 02:35:32,290
There's millions of people with type A.

3213
02:35:32,410 --> 02:35:33,750
They aren't all the same.

3214
02:35:33,830 --> 02:35:36,990
I wonder, is it some kind of trend?

3215
02:35:39,950 --> 02:35:40,990
Makes sense though.

3216
02:35:44,590 --> 02:35:47,050
Going along with that trend, what type do you think I am?

3217
02:35:47,150 --> 02:35:47,710
Go on, guess!

3218
02:35:50,310 --> 02:35:52,570
Wait, I don't know blood types at all.

3219
02:35:59,970 --> 02:36:01,890
O is rare, right?

3220
02:36:03,090 --> 02:36:03,530
So...

3221
02:36:07,450 --> 02:36:07,890
O?

3222
02:36:18,250 --> 02:36:19,210
Don't call her A.

3223
02:36:19,350 --> 02:36:21,930
Yeah, I don't think calling her A would be good, right?

3224
02:36:22,350 --> 02:36:23,590
I do wonder though.

3225
02:36:27,770 --> 02:36:32,410
I do wonder if like, how badly you can mess up with these girls.

3226
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:35,350
Once I like, play the game...

3227
02:36:35,350 --> 02:36:40,410
I want to like, do a fail run where I like, am so... so bad with them.

3228
02:36:40,570 --> 02:36:42,630
Okay, let's try type O.

3229
02:36:48,090 --> 02:36:48,610
Uhhh...

3230
02:36:49,230 --> 02:36:49,750
Nooo!

3231
02:36:54,770 --> 02:36:56,670
She doesn't want to be called type O?

3232
02:36:56,990 --> 02:37:01,250
Isn't that like the... isn't that like the rare one that people really want to be?

3233
02:37:02,850 --> 02:37:03,290
Type B?

3234
02:37:03,730 --> 02:37:05,430
What were type O's supposed to be again?

3235
02:37:05,570 --> 02:37:06,350
Laid back or something?

3236
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:08,630
Well, I guess it's true that I don't sweat the small stuff.

3237
02:37:10,170 --> 02:37:11,050
B-gata!

3238
02:37:12,890 --> 02:37:13,910
I'm actually type B!

3239
02:37:15,030 --> 02:37:15,650
Oh, really?

3240
02:37:23,230 --> 02:37:23,990
That's A, B.

3241
02:37:24,730 --> 02:37:26,390
O can donate to anyone.

3242
02:37:26,670 --> 02:37:26,850
Oh!

3243
02:37:27,630 --> 02:37:28,950
O is the most common.

3244
02:37:29,790 --> 02:37:30,370
What is?

3245
02:37:32,390 --> 02:37:32,830
I don't know.

3246
02:37:32,830 --> 02:37:33,130
Hmm...

3247
02:37:33,550 --> 02:37:34,070
I think we lost.

3248
02:37:34,930 --> 02:37:35,590
We lost.

3249
02:37:36,030 --> 02:37:36,950
We lost...

3250
02:37:38,850 --> 02:37:40,170
Yeah, it wasn't even an opt...

3251
02:37:40,170 --> 02:37:44,210
Maybe she wanted to be called type A because she said she's methodical.

3252
02:37:44,350 --> 02:37:46,810
So maybe she wanted us to also say that she's methodical.

3253
02:37:51,630 --> 02:37:56,790
Do you guys know your blood type?

3254
02:37:57,370 --> 02:37:57,810
Actually...

3255
02:37:58,270 --> 02:37:59,790
I, well, I don't have blood.

3256
02:38:00,430 --> 02:38:00,870
But...

3257
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:02,590
I don't even know what I would be.

3258
02:38:05,610 --> 02:38:08,170
I don't think I ever was told before.

3259
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:13,680
Minus O.

3260
02:38:14,080 --> 02:38:14,520
O.

3261
02:38:15,060 --> 02:38:15,720
O plus.

3262
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:17,120
I'm O plus.

3263
02:38:17,460 --> 02:38:18,200
I think I'm A.

3264
02:38:21,400 --> 02:38:22,760
What ectoplasm type are you?

3265
02:38:24,420 --> 02:38:25,100
Probably E.

3266
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:30,920
It's like I've got the personality traits of all the blood types.

3267
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:33,740
So blood type personality theory isn't reliable at all.

3268
02:38:34,420 --> 02:38:37,940
I think more than a few people would agree if you put it to them like that.

3269
02:38:38,300 --> 02:38:38,740
True.

3270
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:49,380
They say that type A's...

3271
02:38:50,660 --> 02:38:52,740
Sorry, I get sleepy.

3272
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:54,960
And type B's aren't compatible, right?

3273
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:58,040
But my little brother and sister are type A and we get along great.

3274
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:02,500
What's your blood type, Hai-chan?

3275
02:39:02,940 --> 02:39:03,880
I'm type O.

3276
02:39:11,320 --> 02:39:13,620
There's no way this many of you are type O.

3277
02:39:17,970 --> 02:39:18,490
E.

3278
02:39:18,610 --> 02:39:19,490
Yeah, I'm type E.

3279
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:26,700
How compatible were type B and type O supposed to be again?

3280
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:30,140
You don't believe in it, but you're still curious?

3281
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:33,100
I wonder what my blood type is like.

3282
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:36,300
I'm just a little curious.

3283
02:39:36,780 --> 02:39:38,240
I like this face a lot.

3284
02:39:39,080 --> 02:39:40,580
I like this face a lot.

3285
02:39:42,680 --> 02:39:45,160
I was just wondering about how compatible we are.

3286
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:46,720
It was just on my mind a bit.

3287
02:39:46,820 --> 02:39:47,240
That's all.

3288
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:53,800
I don't believe in it, but if we're compatible, that would make me happy.

3289
02:39:53,800 --> 02:39:58,160
I don't believe in it much, but if the two of us were compatible, it'd make me happy.

3290
02:39:58,400 --> 02:39:58,720
This is bad.

3291
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:01,080
When I'm with Hai-chan, time flies.

3292
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:02,840
Why is this game...

3293
02:40:02,840 --> 02:40:04,360
making me feel things.

3294
02:40:09,020 --> 02:40:09,500
Extend.

3295
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:12,880
She's making...

3296
02:40:12,880 --> 02:40:14,140
She's just so cute.

3297
02:40:14,520 --> 02:40:15,720
She's just so cute.

3298
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:22,180
What did I get for her before?

3299
02:40:22,280 --> 02:40:22,900
I don't remember.

3300
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:26,160
You know what?

3301
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:27,060
Let's try...

3302
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:31,800
Let's try a wine for the both of us.

3303
02:40:33,380 --> 02:40:34,680
Wine, wine, wine.

3304
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:36,180
I should probably try all the drinks, right?

3305
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:40,060
She likes it too, though.

3306
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:40,820
Good, good.

3307
02:40:42,880 --> 02:40:44,520
In Japan, A is most common.

3308
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:50,060
Didn't even say a single bit.

3309
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:53,920
Wow, fancy wine.

3310
02:40:56,740 --> 02:40:58,060
I want to be good at games.

3311
02:40:58,380 --> 02:41:00,140
I don't want to lose anymore.

3312
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:04,030
I want to get better at gaming.

3313
02:41:04,250 --> 02:41:05,430
I'm so sick of losing.

3314
02:41:05,810 --> 02:41:07,010
It's been stressing me out.

3315
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:10,370
According to the NHS, people are...

3316
02:41:10,370 --> 02:41:11,470
O plus 35.

3317
02:41:11,850 --> 02:41:12,730
O minus 13.

3318
02:41:13,090 --> 02:41:14,470
A plus 30.

3319
02:41:14,770 --> 02:41:15,790
A minus 8.

3320
02:41:16,050 --> 02:41:17,150
B plus 8.

3321
02:41:17,330 --> 02:41:18,110
B minus 2.

3322
02:41:18,590 --> 02:41:20,170
AB plus 2%.

3323
02:41:20,170 --> 02:41:21,570
AB minus 1.

3324
02:41:21,830 --> 02:41:22,310
Wow.

3325
02:41:23,710 --> 02:41:27,990
I always thought that O was the most rare.

3326
02:41:28,110 --> 02:41:29,210
But I guess it's because...

3327
02:41:30,110 --> 02:41:33,730
Maybe I was just thinking of it being compatible with...

3328
02:41:33,730 --> 02:41:36,790
Like, if you're an O type, you can give blood to anybody, right?

3329
02:41:39,630 --> 02:41:40,790
I know what you mean.

3330
02:41:41,190 --> 02:41:43,770
Competitive games are fun, but losing too much can be a bummer.

3331
02:41:44,050 --> 02:41:44,750
Hey, Hai-chan.

3332
02:41:45,050 --> 02:41:46,910
I don't want to lose anymore.

3333
02:41:47,010 --> 02:41:49,890
What should I do to get better at games?

3334
02:41:50,230 --> 02:41:52,010
Hai-chan, I don't want to lose anymore.

3335
02:41:52,190 --> 02:41:53,730
How can I get better at video games?

3336
02:41:56,530 --> 02:41:57,350
Try it.

3337
02:41:57,530 --> 02:41:58,130
Oh, gosh.

3338
02:41:59,770 --> 02:42:00,530
Sheep tricks?

3339
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:14,830
I think if I tell her to get good, she'll be upset.

3340
02:42:18,980 --> 02:42:19,420
Right?

3341
02:42:19,540 --> 02:42:20,020
I don't know.

3342
02:42:23,980 --> 02:42:24,780
I don't know.

3343
02:42:27,620 --> 02:42:28,380
Get good?

3344
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:29,000
Get good?

3345
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:29,960
Okay.

3346
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:31,480
We'll tell her to get good.

3347
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:33,980
You just got to practice.

3348
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:35,300
Yeah, Bustle.

3349
02:42:35,320 --> 02:42:37,120
Why do I listen to you guys?

3350
02:42:42,460 --> 02:42:45,620
You don't understand the way to a girl's heart at all.

3351
02:42:48,380 --> 02:42:52,220
You don't understand the way to a girl's heart at all.

3352
02:42:53,980 --> 02:42:55,260
Oh, my gosh.

3353
02:43:00,690 --> 02:43:01,730
I knew it.

3354
02:43:01,910 --> 02:43:04,010
It's like that with everything, not just games.

3355
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:06,130
The only way to get stronger is work hard.

3356
02:43:06,250 --> 02:43:06,610
Oh, my gosh.

3357
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:11,730
That's like so many responses in a row that we haven't gotten any hearts on, you guys.

3358
02:43:13,310 --> 02:43:14,710
What games do you play, Rin-chan?

3359
02:43:15,010 --> 02:43:25,770
I mean, have you ever heard of a simple game series?

3360
02:43:26,350 --> 02:43:27,870
It's like kind of popular.

3361
02:43:28,210 --> 02:43:32,790
But, you know, you might have heard of it because you're a gamer and all.

3362
02:43:37,850 --> 02:43:40,050
Do you think she plays Valorant?

3363
02:43:43,190 --> 02:43:45,850
Because losing can get stressful, I've had some problems.

3364
02:43:46,550 --> 02:43:47,170
Problems?

3365
02:43:51,890 --> 02:43:53,950
Sometimes when I lose, I scream.

3366
02:44:02,870 --> 02:44:03,490
Like...

3367
02:44:04,410 --> 02:44:05,030
Or...

3368
02:44:05,030 --> 02:44:05,690
Or...

3369
02:44:05,690 --> 02:44:06,550
Or...

3370
02:44:06,550 --> 02:44:06,590
Or...

3371
02:44:06,590 --> 02:44:06,670
Or...

3372
02:44:36,670 --> 02:44:39,050
Well, she should be an actual streamer.

3373
02:44:39,390 --> 02:44:40,530
Not a VTuber.

3374
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:44,050
Oh, but hang on.

3375
02:44:44,210 --> 02:44:46,630
Even if I win, I might still yell out loud.

3376
02:44:47,190 --> 02:44:47,790
Oh yeah!

3377
02:44:54,380 --> 02:44:56,520
Or, take that, suckers!

3378
02:44:58,740 --> 02:44:59,700
VTubers are cute?

3379
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:00,760
VTubers are cute too?

3380
02:45:01,220 --> 02:45:03,380
I mean, but like...

3381
02:45:04,400 --> 02:45:05,400
But like...

3382
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:10,280
Isn't it nicer that us ugly people can become VTubers too?

3383
02:45:15,660 --> 02:45:17,960
And then when all the attractive people...

3384
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:22,360
There's like some VTubers that also show their faces and stuff.

3385
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:28,240
Must be nice, huh?

3386
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:31,840
Must be nice to be a cute anime girl.

3387
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:34,980
And also be able to turn into a cute human.

3388
02:45:35,860 --> 02:45:36,860
Must be nice.

3389
02:45:39,360 --> 02:45:40,320
Must be nice.

3390
02:45:44,620 --> 02:45:46,220
But honestly, I don't mind.

3391
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:50,600
Because as long as I get to look at cute things, I don't care how I look.

3392
02:45:52,320 --> 02:45:55,240
I don't care how I look as long as I get to look at cute things.

3393
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:57,880
Maybe it'd be better if you soundproofed your room.

3394
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:00,040
What do you want to drink?

3395
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:01,180
Sake, yes!

3396
02:46:01,700 --> 02:46:02,460
What do you want to drink?

3397
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:03,340
What do you want to drink?

3398
02:46:05,580 --> 02:46:07,140
What have we not tried?

3399
02:46:07,260 --> 02:46:08,900
I wonder if she is kind of weirdo.

3400
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:10,220
Does she like the bunny macs?

3401
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:12,540
Here, I'll just get my...

3402
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:13,180
I'll get a beer.

3403
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:15,060
Or maybe she'll...

3404
02:46:15,060 --> 02:46:15,880
Here, let's try a beer.

3405
02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:17,500
Actually, no.

3406
02:46:17,560 --> 02:46:18,820
I want to try the bunny macs.

3407
02:46:22,480 --> 02:46:23,660
Oh, she likes it.

3408
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:25,600
But not like liked liked it.

3409
02:46:33,130 --> 02:46:33,690
Itadakimasu!

3410
02:46:34,570 --> 02:46:35,130
Itadakimasu!

3411
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:42,760
Kami-chan, what do you like about me?

3412
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:44,340
My face?

3413
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:46,540
Or my body?

3414
02:46:51,550 --> 02:46:53,070
I'm asking based on what I like.

3415
02:46:53,810 --> 02:46:58,110
You've come to see me so many times.

3416
02:46:58,510 --> 02:46:59,970
You don't dislike me, do you?

3417
02:47:03,390 --> 02:47:05,650
I keep making a bit of an assumption.

3418
02:47:05,870 --> 02:47:06,790
You like me, huh?

3419
02:47:07,330 --> 02:47:08,310
But you keep coming to see me.

3420
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:09,810
So at least you don't hate me, right?

3421
02:47:10,490 --> 02:47:11,950
Hey Mint, are you winning so far?

3422
02:47:12,230 --> 02:47:13,350
I don't know, actually.

3423
02:47:13,750 --> 02:47:14,530
I can't tell.

3424
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:15,850
I think she likes me though, right?

3425
02:47:16,430 --> 02:47:18,010
I think she likes me though, right?

3426
02:47:19,750 --> 02:47:20,990
Of course I don't hate you.

3427
02:47:21,170 --> 02:47:23,330
But if you ask me which part of you I like...

3428
02:47:33,690 --> 02:47:34,790
Which part is a coco?

3429
02:47:35,210 --> 02:47:36,310
Which part is coco?

3430
02:47:36,910 --> 02:47:38,290
Which part do you mean coco?

3431
02:47:39,970 --> 02:47:40,790
Get a good look.

3432
02:47:40,950 --> 02:47:41,250
Here?

3433
02:47:41,250 --> 02:47:42,590
Or maybe here?

3434
02:47:42,990 --> 02:47:44,490
Maybe like this part?

3435
02:47:45,110 --> 02:47:46,310
I don't know.

3436
02:47:46,630 --> 02:47:46,630
What?

3437
02:47:46,890 --> 02:47:47,890
Are you embarrassed?

3438
02:47:49,470 --> 02:47:54,650
But what's embarrassing is this part.

3439
02:47:55,650 --> 02:47:56,870
She's so cute.

3440
02:47:57,610 --> 02:47:58,470
What's wrong?

3441
02:47:58,590 --> 02:47:59,110
Are you embarrassed?

3442
02:47:59,650 --> 02:48:00,570
Doesn't that seem backwards?

3443
02:48:00,950 --> 02:48:02,690
I'm the one who's embarrassed.

3444
02:48:03,930 --> 02:48:04,490
I like coco.

3445
02:48:04,930 --> 02:48:07,590
So please answer me quickly.

3446
02:48:08,670 --> 02:48:11,610
Which part of me do you like?

3447
02:48:13,670 --> 02:48:14,930
Hurry up and answer.

3448
02:48:15,130 --> 02:48:17,150
What part of me do you like?

3449
02:48:17,310 --> 02:48:19,350
Oh, your personality.

3450
02:48:20,850 --> 02:48:23,590
You keep your guard down, so it's easy to talk to you, Rin-chan.

3451
02:48:24,270 --> 02:48:25,610
Wait, Hai-chan.

3452
02:48:26,110 --> 02:48:26,410
Huh?

3453
02:48:26,890 --> 02:48:30,830
When I say sexy, you say coco or here.

3454
02:48:31,970 --> 02:48:33,190
But you like personality.

3455
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:35,250
Bob.

3456
02:48:37,030 --> 02:48:38,310
I'm asking you.

3457
02:48:38,550 --> 02:48:40,270
Which part of me is sexy?

3458
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:41,370
This part?

3459
02:48:41,530 --> 02:48:42,150
Or here?

3460
02:48:42,150 --> 02:48:44,110
But you're saying you like my personality?

3461
02:48:44,590 --> 02:48:45,630
She seems kind of upset.

3462
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:46,990
This is unfair.

3463
02:48:47,810 --> 02:48:48,330
My

3464
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,020
position is reversed.

3465
02:48:57,970 --> 02:48:59,710
I'm passing away.

3466
02:49:01,070 --> 02:49:02,070
She's so cute.

3467
02:49:03,330 --> 02:49:04,290
This is not fair.

3468
02:49:04,570 --> 02:49:06,030
I'm really starting to feel embarrassed.

3469
02:49:06,330 --> 02:49:08,210
How did you turn the situation around like that?

3470
02:49:08,510 --> 02:49:10,370
Well, it's okay because I'm happy.

3471
02:49:16,410 --> 02:49:17,450
W Riz?

3472
02:49:17,910 --> 02:49:18,430
No.

3473
02:49:20,870 --> 02:49:22,070
Still made me happy.

3474
02:49:22,630 --> 02:49:26,150
So you hang out with me because you like my personality.

3475
02:49:29,270 --> 02:49:30,430
When did it get so late?

3476
02:49:30,690 --> 02:49:31,390
Time to go.

3477
02:49:34,210 --> 02:49:35,170
Oh, Haito.

3478
02:49:35,170 --> 02:49:37,630
You dummy, dum-dum, dummy, dum-dum.

3479
02:49:42,170 --> 02:49:43,490
See you soon.

3480
02:49:47,210 --> 02:49:47,690
Motivated.

3481
02:49:49,790 --> 02:49:50,590
Motivation up.

3482
02:49:50,990 --> 02:49:52,030
I hope I get a bonus.

3483
02:49:52,810 --> 02:49:54,770
Give me more money so I can spend it on her.

3484
02:49:59,870 --> 02:50:01,070
Ooh, Haito.

3485
02:50:12,830 --> 02:50:13,870
This guy.

3486
02:50:13,950 --> 02:50:15,670
This guy has like...

3487
02:50:16,750 --> 02:50:18,530
Zero Riz for real.

3488
02:50:22,800 --> 02:50:24,000
He's so...

3489
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,760
He's so funny.

3490
02:50:26,060 --> 02:50:28,580
It's like right as it's starting to get steamy, he's like...

3491
02:50:29,180 --> 02:50:29,740
Gotta dip.

3492
02:50:33,080 --> 02:50:34,200
Oh, my God.

3493
02:50:36,020 --> 02:50:38,820
The money.

3494
02:50:38,980 --> 02:50:40,060
I mean, we got the money.

3495
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:40,740
We won.

3496
02:50:40,860 --> 02:50:41,500
Oh, shit.

3497
02:50:41,640 --> 02:50:42,520
Why did I say yes again?

3498
02:50:42,660 --> 02:50:43,460
I'm such an idiot.

3499
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:44,660
Why did I say yes again?

3500
02:50:44,880 --> 02:50:46,040
Why did I say yes again?

3501
02:50:46,120 --> 02:50:47,060
I meant to exit out.

3502
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:48,160
I did it on accident.

3503
02:51:05,230 --> 02:51:05,610
Rich.

3504
02:51:08,250 --> 02:51:08,630
Rich.

3505
02:51:09,290 --> 02:51:09,670
Rich.

3506
02:51:10,290 --> 02:51:10,670
Rich.

3507
02:51:13,130 --> 02:51:13,510
Rich.

3508
02:51:14,170 --> 02:51:14,550
Rich.

3509
02:51:14,550 --> 02:51:15,010
I'm such an idiot.

3510
02:51:18,730 --> 02:51:20,850
I'm such a pervert.

3511
02:51:21,250 --> 02:51:21,770
But...

3512
02:51:21,770 --> 02:51:22,690
I got it.

3513
02:51:22,690 --> 02:51:23,450
I'm such a pervert.

3514
02:51:23,450 --> 02:51:23,690
I have to say it over again.

3515
02:51:23,690 --> 02:51:24,010
One more.

3516
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:27,330
I can't wait.

3517
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:30,350
I'm almost out of breath.

3518
02:51:31,050 --> 02:51:31,890
Hmmmm...

3519
02:51:31,890 --> 02:51:32,030
Too hot.

3520
02:51:32,030 --> 02:51:32,150
No,

3521
02:51:37,810 --> 02:51:38,130
this is a bit of an end.

3522
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:41,880
Lame.

3523
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:43,320
I need to...

3524
02:51:43,320 --> 02:51:43,900
Yes.

3525
02:51:44,660 --> 02:51:45,500
Hmmmm.

3526
02:51:46,140 --> 02:51:46,980
Yes.

3527
02:51:46,980 --> 02:51:47,020
Mmmmm.

3528
02:51:47,420 --> 02:51:48,160
Mmm...

3529
02:51:48,160 --> 02:51:48,340
Excuse me.

3530
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:49,760
Sorry.

3531
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:53,820
Rin starts to lean into Hito and he hightails it.

3532
02:51:53,940 --> 02:51:56,220
He's just like, me for real, for real, for real.

3533
02:51:58,040 --> 02:51:58,740
One more?

3534
02:52:02,540 --> 02:52:03,900
The luxury bag?

3535
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:06,160
Oh my god, I'll have no money.

3536
02:52:07,140 --> 02:52:08,200
I'll have no money.

3537
02:52:10,740 --> 02:52:11,180
Pajamas?

3538
02:52:11,220 --> 02:52:12,020
I already got her that.

3539
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:14,280
Hmm...

3540
02:52:17,710 --> 02:52:20,750
She likes toys, so like plushies, right?

3541
02:52:23,950 --> 02:52:25,230
Let's get her the plushie, it's cute.

3542
02:52:29,720 --> 02:52:30,380
Shun-sui!

3543
02:52:30,540 --> 02:52:31,340
Thank you for the gift.

3544
02:52:31,360 --> 02:52:31,900
Thank you!

3545
02:52:32,780 --> 02:52:33,860
What should I drink today?

3546
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:34,340
Beer?

3547
02:52:34,460 --> 02:52:34,740
Wine?

3548
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:35,200
Champagne?

3549
02:52:35,460 --> 02:52:36,880
Let's just get in there first.

3550
02:52:37,020 --> 02:52:37,420
Go!

3551
02:52:46,840 --> 02:52:47,500
I'm going home.

3552
02:53:01,340 --> 02:53:02,460
Chat froze?

3553
02:53:02,820 --> 02:53:04,400
Oh, let me see if I can fix it.

3554
02:53:06,640 --> 02:53:09,580
There you guys are.

3555
02:53:09,940 --> 02:53:11,620
It's her day off, you guys.

3556
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:14,360
It's her day off.

3557
02:53:16,260 --> 02:53:17,800
Give me the cashes.

3558
02:53:18,980 --> 02:53:21,640
Actually, I'll get the oolong highball.

3559
02:53:29,480 --> 02:53:31,140
You can get the cashes.

3560
02:53:32,440 --> 02:53:33,000
Actually, no.

3561
02:53:37,400 --> 02:53:38,980
Wait, I wanted to go home!

3562
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:42,240
I wanted to go home.

3563
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:43,040
I should've...

3564
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:48,220
I should've just bought the drink for her and then didn't extend my time.

3565
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:50,740
I'm wasting my money, you guys.

3566
02:53:51,180 --> 02:53:51,700
Oh well.

3567
02:53:53,360 --> 02:53:54,920
What do you like to do on your days off?

3568
02:53:55,780 --> 02:53:56,560
Play with my sister.

3569
02:53:58,220 --> 02:53:58,800
Play with my sister.

3570
02:53:58,820 --> 02:53:59,100
Go to the park.

3571
02:54:01,260 --> 02:54:02,220
She's cute though.

3572
02:54:03,260 --> 02:54:04,220
That sounds nice.

3573
02:54:04,600 --> 02:54:06,520
Is there a big age gap between you and your sister?

3574
02:54:06,640 --> 02:54:09,720
Oh, she likes to go to the park with her sister, is what she said.

3575
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:15,980
She's still a second grader in elementary school.

3576
02:54:19,160 --> 02:54:20,300
Wow, that's a big difference.

3577
02:54:20,580 --> 02:54:22,140
What kind of games do you play with your sister?

3578
02:54:22,340 --> 02:54:24,640
Hide and seek.

3579
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:24,740
Hide and seek.

3580
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:28,760
Oh, you two must be close.

3581
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:33,320
Because I'm the only one?

3582
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:34,980
What do you mean by that?

3583
02:54:35,100 --> 02:54:37,560
My parents never died in accidents.

3584
02:54:42,890 --> 02:54:45,030
Moeka is alone with me.

3585
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:55,840
I think Miu-kun's trauma is just a little bit.

3586
02:54:55,980 --> 02:55:00,120
I guess I got kind of asked, right?

3587
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:06,260
I'm sorry, but my parents died in an accident.

3588
02:55:06,700 --> 02:55:09,300
I'm the only one my little sister Moika has.

3589
02:55:10,980 --> 02:55:11,860
I didn't know.

3590
02:55:11,920 --> 02:55:12,740
I'm so sorry.

3591
02:55:12,820 --> 02:55:13,600
I'm so sorry.

3592
02:55:14,040 --> 02:55:14,960
Oh, thank you for the raid!

3593
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:15,380
Thank you!

3594
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:17,980
Yeah, it's okay.

3595
02:55:20,300 --> 02:55:21,500
Is it hard living together?

3596
02:55:21,660 --> 02:55:22,400
Just the two of you?

3597
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:24,380
Maybe they're not lonely.

3598
02:55:24,460 --> 02:55:24,980
I don't want to say that.

3599
02:55:25,880 --> 02:55:26,660
Is it hard living?

3600
02:55:26,660 --> 02:55:27,100
Maybe it's hard.

3601
02:55:28,240 --> 02:55:31,120
More than me, Moika is...

3602
02:55:32,280 --> 02:55:34,340
I'm sorry, Moika.

3603
02:55:35,620 --> 02:55:39,620
Yeah, more so for Moika than I feel so sorry for her.

3604
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:42,640
I can help you.

3605
02:55:42,780 --> 02:55:44,100
What do you mean by that?

3606
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:44,640
It's okay.

3607
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:45,520
Huh?

3608
02:55:47,320 --> 02:55:48,720
You're the foundation?

3609
02:55:48,980 --> 02:55:51,360
So you're the foundation of her life?

3610
02:55:52,540 --> 02:55:53,160
Right.

3611
02:55:53,980 --> 02:55:54,600
What?

3612
02:55:54,600 --> 02:55:56,720
There's no one I can rely on.

3613
02:55:57,500 --> 02:55:58,660
Ducky, thanks for the gift!

3614
02:55:58,900 --> 02:56:00,120
Andricos, thanks for the 10 gifts!

3615
02:56:02,840 --> 02:56:05,300
Yes, there's no one else I can turn to.

3616
02:56:06,060 --> 02:56:06,720
That's unbelievable.

3617
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:08,640
I admire you for doing that.

3618
02:56:09,920 --> 02:56:10,400
What?

3619
02:56:10,660 --> 02:56:10,680
It's not amazing.

3620
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:12,780
Just living.

3621
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:15,260
It's not unbelievable.

3622
02:56:15,860 --> 02:56:17,020
I just live.

3623
02:56:17,260 --> 02:56:19,480
Just the two of us.

3624
02:56:19,680 --> 02:56:21,740
Aito, do you want to drink a little more?

3625
02:56:21,740 --> 02:56:22,460
Do you want to drink a little more?

3626
02:56:23,600 --> 02:56:25,540
If you do, I'll prepare it for you.

3627
02:56:27,380 --> 02:56:29,500
Um, I think the vibes have been...

3628
02:56:31,060 --> 02:56:32,620
Ruby, thank you for the five gifted!

3629
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:36,040
See ya!

3630
02:56:40,460 --> 02:56:41,280
See you later!

3631
02:56:41,740 --> 02:56:42,460
Bye bye!

3632
02:56:45,380 --> 02:56:46,160
Thanks for everything.

3633
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:49,200
Oh, they don't see me out the door because I didn't spend enough money.

3634
02:56:50,200 --> 02:56:51,440
Okay, Nin-chan!

3635
02:56:52,440 --> 02:56:53,600
Nin-chan!

3636
02:57:05,710 --> 02:57:07,350
I feel bad now, though.

3637
02:57:09,070 --> 02:57:10,730
Don't worry about it.

3638
02:57:11,590 --> 02:57:12,910
Drink to forget.

3639
02:57:13,690 --> 02:57:15,010
Don't worry about it.

3640
02:57:15,030 --> 02:57:15,570
We're just...

3641
02:57:17,170 --> 02:57:19,430
We're just getting rich, baby!

3642
02:57:22,230 --> 02:57:22,910
Yeah!

3643
02:57:25,810 --> 02:57:27,010
Oh, man.

3644
02:57:27,730 --> 02:57:29,430
I'm gonna buy her a good bottle.

3645
02:57:29,630 --> 02:57:31,470
I'm gonna buy her the bottle.

3646
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:47,140
Get me, um...

3647
02:57:48,900 --> 02:57:51,160
Give me a special highball.

3648
02:57:52,060 --> 02:57:53,260
Of course.

3649
02:57:54,880 --> 02:57:57,640
Let's get her the big shampoo.

3650
02:57:57,640 --> 02:58:02,180
Um, so if I get this really expensive one, is her skirt just gonna fly off?

3651
02:58:02,360 --> 02:58:02,980
Is it just gonna go...

3652
02:58:02,980 --> 02:58:05,020
Is it gonna, like, tear into a thousand pieces?

3653
02:58:05,440 --> 02:58:06,720
She's gonna be like, Yaha!

3654
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:08,820
And I'm just like, Oh, ho, ho!

3655
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:10,700
This is what money can buy!

3656
02:58:11,900 --> 02:58:12,540
You know?

3657
02:58:14,440 --> 02:58:15,160
I wonder.

3658
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:18,520
I'm gonna get her...

3659
02:58:18,520 --> 02:58:20,020
Easy to get drug from it.

3660
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:21,720
Really?

3661
02:58:22,140 --> 02:58:22,580
Yay!

3662
02:58:25,590 --> 02:58:27,390
Shh, shh, shh.

3663
02:58:27,490 --> 02:58:27,910
Okay.

3664
02:58:27,910 --> 02:58:30,450
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

3665
02:58:30,490 --> 02:58:30,970
Whoa!

3666
02:58:31,570 --> 02:58:32,530
Today there's...

3667
02:58:32,530 --> 02:58:34,130
There's zebras.

3668
02:58:37,790 --> 02:58:38,870
Zebra print!

3669
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:47,900
I didn't expect the zebra print.

3670
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:52,340
Ah, here's...

3671
02:58:53,170 --> 02:58:53,560
Dozo.

3672
02:58:54,140 --> 02:58:57,440
Yeah, she liked it.

3673
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:00,980
I'm so happy about this.

3674
02:59:01,320 --> 02:59:04,000
Do you have any siblings?

3675
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:04,380
Hai-chan?

3676
02:59:04,940 --> 02:59:05,360
Nope.

3677
02:59:05,440 --> 02:59:06,480
I'm an only child.

3678
02:59:14,580 --> 02:59:16,080
What did you say to her?

3679
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:19,520
Why is she suddenly asking about if I have siblings, huh?

3680
02:59:19,760 --> 02:59:23,100
After I talked to you yesterday, Miuka, about...

3681
02:59:23,100 --> 02:59:24,540
About that you're a sibling.

3682
02:59:26,900 --> 02:59:27,320
Huh?

3683
02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:29,660
What did you say...

3684
02:59:29,660 --> 02:59:30,580
What did you tell her?

3685
02:59:31,240 --> 02:59:32,420
What did you tell her?

3686
02:59:36,740 --> 02:59:38,800
You kind of give off an older brother vibe.

3687
02:59:38,980 --> 02:59:40,700
So I thought you must have a little brother or sister.

3688
02:59:47,660 --> 02:59:48,560
As for me...

3689
02:59:48,560 --> 02:59:49,560
Oh yeah, I mentioned it earlier.

3690
02:59:49,660 --> 02:59:51,120
Back when we were talking about blood types.

3691
02:59:51,240 --> 02:59:51,740
Wait, what did she...

3692
02:59:51,740 --> 02:59:52,280
What did she say?

3693
02:59:57,440 --> 02:59:57,800
Oh!

3694
02:59:59,080 --> 02:59:59,440
They're...

3695
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:00,620
They're A-type!

3696
03:00:00,680 --> 03:00:01,200
They're A-type!

3697
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:02,380
Do you remember Hai-chan?

3698
03:00:02,580 --> 03:00:05,200
I'll be impressed if you remember my family member's blood types.

3699
03:00:06,120 --> 03:00:06,480
Um...

3700
03:00:07,020 --> 03:00:07,940
Younger brother...

3701
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:11,840
And younger sister...

3702
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:13,460
Are both...

3703
03:00:13,460 --> 03:00:14,000
A.

3704
03:00:14,800 --> 03:00:15,520
Yeah!

3705
03:00:22,660 --> 03:00:23,380
Wow,

3706
03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:28,160
you like actually remembered?

3707
03:00:28,480 --> 03:00:29,400
What should I do?

3708
03:00:29,600 --> 03:00:31,640
How about a kiss on the cheek as a reward?

3709
03:00:33,320 --> 03:00:34,040
Good.

3710
03:00:41,180 --> 03:00:44,040
I have a little brother and sister who are way younger than me.

3711
03:00:44,080 --> 03:00:45,560
They're both super cute.

3712
03:00:45,860 --> 03:00:48,600
When I go back to my parents' house, they call me Onee-chan, Onee-chan.

3713
03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:52,620
They come and stick their feet into my door.

3714
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:55,560
And they're super cute, right?

3715
03:00:55,800 --> 03:00:56,580
Super cute!

3716
03:00:57,220 --> 03:01:00,760
Whenever I visit my parents, they cling to me and call me Big sis!

3717
03:01:00,980 --> 03:01:01,400
Big sis!

3718
03:01:01,740 --> 03:01:03,940
They literally wrap themselves around my legs.

3719
03:01:04,100 --> 03:01:05,100
Totes adorbs!

3720
03:01:05,100 --> 03:01:05,180
I'm so cute!

3721
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:05,600
Don't diagnose me, you guys!

3722
03:01:05,600 --> 03:01:06,820
We are so in.

3723
03:01:06,900 --> 03:01:11,140
Oh my god, she's getting everything- Oh my god, guys, she's talking about her family.

3724
03:01:11,240 --> 03:01:15,500
This is basically like meeting her family.

3725
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:15,840
You know?

3726
03:01:15,920 --> 03:01:17,660
She's so- We're already on that level.

3727
03:01:17,840 --> 03:01:18,820
Oh my gosh.

3728
03:01:19,300 --> 03:01:21,900
Are you so reliable because you are an older sister, Nin-chan?

3729
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:26,760
jijroo It was suspicious of her without makeup.

3730
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,040
And her mother was back home.

3731
03:01:29,440 --> 03:01:29,920
It was ridiculous.

3732
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:34,400
It's like my younger sister, важ eu thang ajiez ikko You think I'm reliable?

3733
03:01:34,700 --> 03:01:35,180
Yeh.

3734
03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:35,600
Really?

3735
03:01:36,020 --> 03:01:37,180
That's how you think of me?

3736
03:01:37,360 --> 03:01:38,360
I think I'm blushing.

3737
03:01:42,340 --> 03:01:48,040
But compared to me, Miyuka is definitely more of a reliable big sister.

3738
03:01:48,300 --> 03:01:49,920
Miyuka, one of the cast members here?

3739
03:01:50,440 --> 03:01:52,560
Yeah, we're like basically married.

3740
03:01:53,160 --> 03:01:53,820
Oh my gosh.

3741
03:01:58,420 --> 03:01:59,020
I'm...

3742
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,380
I'm... but you... children!

3743
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:06,520
She also has a much younger sister, but they live together.

3744
03:02:06,740 --> 03:02:08,060
She looks after her too.

3745
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:08,960
She's amazing!

3746
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:20,340
I mean, don't... I don't mean to compare us, but there's a lot of things I'm not so reliable at.

3747
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:20,740
You know?

3748
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:30,920
Like I spoil my younger siblings way too much.

3749
03:02:31,020 --> 03:02:32,260
I buy toys and stuff for them.

3750
03:02:32,380 --> 03:02:33,200
All the time.

3751
03:02:39,100 --> 03:02:40,420
We have a wife.

3752
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:44,660
I'm so proud of us, you guys!

3753
03:02:44,720 --> 03:02:45,720
I'm so proud of us!

3754
03:02:46,200 --> 03:02:48,200
We're gonna grow old with Nin-chan!

3755
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:52,160
I'm gonna be like that guy that married Hatsune Miku.

3756
03:02:52,520 --> 03:02:54,300
Just gonna put Nin-chan on an iPad.

3757
03:02:56,240 --> 03:02:58,180
Talking about them is making me miss them!

3758
03:02:58,340 --> 03:02:59,520
I'll call when I go home.

3759
03:02:59,900 --> 03:03:01,940
Oh, they'll be asleep in the morning then.

3760
03:03:02,380 --> 03:03:04,520
Hatsune Miku, don't you have enough to drink?

3761
03:03:04,980 --> 03:03:08,750
I still have a lot of things to prepare...

3762
03:03:08,750 --> 03:03:09,750
Oh, that's... extend!

3763
03:03:10,570 --> 03:03:11,190
What do you drink?

3764
03:03:15,670 --> 03:03:18,370
I guess it doesn't really matter what I buy.

3765
03:03:18,570 --> 03:03:19,850
Let's get some fine wine.

3766
03:03:21,130 --> 03:03:22,350
What do you like?

3767
03:03:25,510 --> 03:03:27,290
What's your favorite thing?

3768
03:03:27,790 --> 03:03:29,210
Is it this young man?

3769
03:03:29,950 --> 03:03:30,870
I don't know.

3770
03:03:31,670 --> 03:03:32,750
Don't forget the present.

3771
03:03:32,750 --> 03:03:34,510
I already gave it to her.

3772
03:03:34,950 --> 03:03:36,110
I already gave it to her.

3773
03:03:39,770 --> 03:03:42,490
I want... I'm gonna get the bunny punch since...

3774
03:03:46,070 --> 03:03:47,970
I mean, I could get...

3775
03:03:49,770 --> 03:03:51,330
The lab parry.

3776
03:03:54,570 --> 03:03:56,210
Everyone loves the yo man.

3777
03:03:56,870 --> 03:03:59,990
Oh my god, I almost accidentally pressed decision on this one.

3778
03:04:02,530 --> 03:04:02,890
Oh...

3779
03:04:10,480 --> 03:04:12,060
She likes the champagne a lot.

3780
03:04:13,280 --> 03:04:13,640
Yeah...

3781
03:04:13,640 --> 03:04:14,980
Look at her staring at me.

3782
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:17,340
So patiently waiting for me to make a decision.

3783
03:04:19,860 --> 03:04:21,100
See if it'll let you get...

3784
03:04:21,100 --> 03:04:22,000
No, I don't have enough money.

3785
03:04:22,120 --> 03:04:23,480
I don't have enough money for the yo man.

3786
03:04:24,980 --> 03:04:25,580
You know what?

3787
03:04:25,800 --> 03:04:26,880
Go big or go home.

3788
03:04:27,860 --> 03:04:28,300
Seriously?

3789
03:04:28,660 --> 03:04:29,100
Yay!

3790
03:04:29,940 --> 03:04:30,540
I'll go get the bottle.

3791
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:37,540
We're getting paid soon anyway.

3792
03:04:37,740 --> 03:04:38,140
So whatever.

3793
03:04:38,440 --> 03:04:38,840
It doesn't matter.

3794
03:04:40,800 --> 03:04:41,240
Itadakimasu.

3795
03:04:44,200 --> 03:04:44,640
Itadakimasu.

3796
03:04:46,700 --> 03:04:47,140
Okay.

3797
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:51,460
Oh, yes.

3798
03:04:51,580 --> 03:04:52,600
Oh, I can't give her any...

3799
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:52,960
Okay, yeah.

3800
03:04:53,660 --> 03:04:54,300
Hai-chan.

3801
03:04:54,720 --> 03:04:55,440
Can you draw?

3802
03:04:56,760 --> 03:04:57,200
Illustrations?

3803
03:04:57,560 --> 03:04:58,940
Oh, can you draw at all?

3804
03:04:59,040 --> 03:04:59,680
Like illustrations?

3805
03:05:00,600 --> 03:05:01,440
Not very well.

3806
03:05:01,600 --> 03:05:02,300
Why do you ask?

3807
03:05:02,600 --> 03:05:05,060
I'll do the original, so you can draw.

3808
03:05:06,340 --> 03:05:07,820
We'll both become manga artists.

3809
03:05:08,380 --> 03:05:09,200
Isn't that great?

3810
03:05:09,280 --> 03:05:09,360
Oh!

3811
03:05:10,260 --> 03:05:12,460
I'll write the story and you can do the drawings.

3812
03:05:12,580 --> 03:05:15,180
Let's become a manga author tag team.

3813
03:05:15,340 --> 03:05:16,040
What do you say?

3814
03:05:16,740 --> 03:05:17,980
Can you write, Rin-chan?

3815
03:05:18,300 --> 03:05:19,660
A long time ago...

3816
03:05:20,380 --> 03:05:24,200
There was a father and a mother in a certain place.

3817
03:05:24,320 --> 03:05:24,840
Oh.

3818
03:05:25,660 --> 03:05:29,780
Once upon a time in a certain land, there was a father...

3819
03:05:29,780 --> 03:05:31,380
I mean a mother and a father.

3820
03:05:32,740 --> 03:05:34,720
That sounds like the opening to a folktale.

3821
03:05:35,160 --> 03:05:37,300
Doesn't that sound more like a picture book than a manga?

3822
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:38,720
A manga author?

3823
03:05:39,960 --> 03:05:41,060
That might be a good thing.

3824
03:05:41,540 --> 03:05:43,340
My younger brother and younger sister will be happy.

3825
03:05:44,200 --> 03:05:45,800
A picture book author, huh?

3826
03:05:46,240 --> 03:05:47,580
That could work, too.

3827
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:50,280
It'd make my little brother and sister really happy.

3828
03:05:50,620 --> 03:05:54,040
Every time she sticks her finger up like that, it makes me just want to talk like a nerd.

3829
03:05:54,440 --> 03:05:54,880
But...

3830
03:05:55,500 --> 03:05:57,180
I can't think of anything else.

3831
03:05:58,600 --> 03:05:59,860
I guess I can't.

3832
03:05:59,860 --> 03:06:00,020
It's impossible.

3833
03:06:00,780 --> 03:06:02,100
I've been longing for creative activities.

3834
03:06:04,120 --> 03:06:06,300
That's like the very beginning of the story.

3835
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:11,160
But I can't come up with anything past that.

3836
03:06:11,440 --> 03:06:13,120
I guess I'm just not cut out for it.

3837
03:06:13,300 --> 03:06:14,760
I wish I was more creative.

3838
03:06:15,920 --> 03:06:20,320
When you read manga, don't you want to write something fun like this?

3839
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:27,120
When you read manga and stuff, do you ever think, Man, I wish I could write something this good?

3840
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:28,780
Hmm.

3841
03:06:30,880 --> 03:06:32,040
I did when I was a kid.

3842
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:34,340
I wanted to be a manga author or a film director.

3843
03:06:38,220 --> 03:06:38,620
Same.

3844
03:06:38,860 --> 03:06:40,380
I can't help but envy people like that.

3845
03:06:46,700 --> 03:06:48,880
I wonder if I can write something, too.

3846
03:06:49,220 --> 03:06:50,840
Maybe if it's a game genre I'm good at.

3847
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:58,280
Hai-chan, can you draw sexy girls?

3848
03:06:59,860 --> 03:07:00,020
Sorry.

3849
03:07:00,260 --> 03:07:02,260
But I don't think I can draw much of anything at all.

3850
03:07:02,840 --> 03:07:06,580
Maybe I should use you as a reference.

3851
03:07:06,800 --> 03:07:09,560
Then I could get better at...

3852
03:07:10,040 --> 03:07:11,060
Come on, Haito.

3853
03:07:11,100 --> 03:07:11,360
Say it.

3854
03:07:11,460 --> 03:07:13,220
Hai-chan, what do you want to drink?

3855
03:07:13,640 --> 03:07:14,560
Do you want to drink a little more?

3856
03:07:15,440 --> 03:07:16,060
Let's get something ready.

3857
03:07:18,440 --> 03:07:19,720
Let's get something else to drink.

3858
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:20,420
You did it!

3859
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:22,720
You were about to get a little lonely.

3860
03:07:25,520 --> 03:07:26,300
I... I...

3861
03:07:26,760 --> 03:07:28,740
I'm starting to actually get a bit of a...

3862
03:07:28,740 --> 03:07:29,580
headache.

3863
03:07:30,100 --> 03:07:32,020
So this might be my last day.

3864
03:07:32,120 --> 03:07:32,880
But I'm so sad!

3865
03:07:32,980 --> 03:07:34,200
I wanted to get more stuff.

3866
03:07:34,280 --> 03:07:35,400
I wanted to unlock the...

3867
03:07:35,400 --> 03:07:36,100
the...

3868
03:07:36,740 --> 03:07:36,960
the...

3869
03:07:36,960 --> 03:07:38,460
the vacations.

3870
03:07:40,080 --> 03:07:40,520
But...

3871
03:07:43,080 --> 03:07:44,020
Next time, maybe.

3872
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:45,520
So let's get to the end of this night.

3873
03:07:46,620 --> 03:07:47,500
Let's drink...

3874
03:07:48,460 --> 03:07:49,740
I'm gonna have a simple beer.

3875
03:07:50,360 --> 03:07:51,840
I'm a simple man.

3876
03:07:52,300 --> 03:07:53,700
And I'll get you...

3877
03:07:56,640 --> 03:07:57,540
What did she like?

3878
03:07:57,540 --> 03:07:58,440
I like, uh, the highball.

3879
03:07:58,500 --> 03:07:59,040
Uh, the umeshu.

3880
03:08:09,820 --> 03:08:12,820
I like seeing just the tiny bit of cheeks, right?

3881
03:08:13,440 --> 03:08:14,300
It's kinda cute.

3882
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:23,020
Hai-chan, are you hiding something from me?

3883
03:08:25,980 --> 03:08:27,280
No, I don't think so.

3884
03:08:28,040 --> 03:08:28,920
Why do you ask?

3885
03:08:29,860 --> 03:08:30,700
Are you trying to hide something from me?

3886
03:08:32,460 --> 03:08:32,900
Aren't you just choosing things out of our hearts?

3887
03:08:32,900 --> 03:08:33,560
That's not what I like to do.

3888
03:08:33,560 --> 03:08:35,000
Draw me like you're French girl's mint.

3889
03:08:35,340 --> 03:08:37,280
When I get married, shouldn't you be more difficult with your people?

3890
03:08:39,240 --> 03:08:39,680
Not a problem.

3891
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:41,240
Don't you find it hard to keep secrets like that?

3892
03:08:41,400 --> 03:08:41,800
What did I do?

3893
03:08:41,800 --> 03:08:42,420
I'm no good at it.

3894
03:08:42,460 --> 03:08:42,720
Don't you think I'm also a stupid?

3895
03:08:42,720 --> 03:08:45,100
People tell me that my face makes it super obvious.

3896
03:08:45,380 --> 03:08:52,720
My friends and family have planned a surprise party or something, but it hasn't worked out.

3897
03:08:53,620 --> 03:08:57,980
I've tried planning surprise parties for friends and family members, but it's never worked.

3898
03:08:57,980 --> 03:08:59,540
They always figure it out.

3899
03:09:01,540 --> 03:09:02,780
She knows I'm a Vtuber.

3900
03:09:03,320 --> 03:09:05,240
She knows that I'm streaming this.

3901
03:09:06,920 --> 03:09:08,580
Are you good at keeping secrets, Hai-chan?

3902
03:09:10,420 --> 03:09:12,420
I have nothing to hide.

3903
03:09:13,960 --> 03:09:15,660
I have nothing to hide.

3904
03:09:24,040 --> 03:09:26,340
Oh my god, we got a good reaction out of her.

3905
03:09:28,160 --> 03:09:29,360
You can't be serious.

3906
03:09:29,540 --> 03:09:30,340
Nothing at all?

3907
03:09:30,540 --> 03:09:32,540
You just lay everything out bare, huh?

3908
03:09:32,780 --> 03:09:33,540
That's amazing.

3909
03:09:38,080 --> 03:09:42,720
I lay it all out, everybody.

3910
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:45,080
I'm not good at keeping secrets.

3911
03:09:45,320 --> 03:09:48,560
But I also usually can't tell if someone is hiding something from me.

3912
03:09:49,260 --> 03:09:51,480
You mean you don't notice when someone lies to you?

3913
03:09:57,980 --> 03:10:00,860
The wool has been pulled over my eyes more than a few times.

3914
03:10:01,140 --> 03:10:02,040
It sucks.

3915
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:08,020
She's so cute.

3916
03:10:11,620 --> 03:10:12,820
Like, what the heck?

3917
03:10:12,960 --> 03:10:15,460
When I try to lie, they figure it out right away.

3918
03:10:15,660 --> 03:10:16,480
It's not fair.

3919
03:10:16,780 --> 03:10:18,500
This whole world is so unfair.

3920
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:21,320
She has toggles.

3921
03:10:21,860 --> 03:10:22,740
It's a lie, right?

3922
03:10:23,340 --> 03:10:25,920
Well, I don't really like people who lie a lot anyway.

3923
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:28,280
I much prefer honest people like you, Rin-chan.

3924
03:10:35,960 --> 03:10:38,600
If you say so, then I guess it's fine.

3925
03:10:39,640 --> 03:10:40,640
Oh, it's getting late.

3926
03:10:40,740 --> 03:10:42,280
Go home.

3927
03:10:43,020 --> 03:10:43,980
Holy moly.

3928
03:10:44,500 --> 03:10:45,380
I am broke.

3929
03:10:46,140 --> 03:10:47,120
This checks out.

3930
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:49,380
You started the game telling everyone you just got fired.

3931
03:10:49,860 --> 03:10:50,860
That's so true.

3932
03:10:53,400 --> 03:10:54,360
Come again.

3933
03:10:54,880 --> 03:10:55,600
I'll be waiting.

3934
03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:56,900
I'll be waiting.

3935
03:10:59,680 --> 03:11:00,700
Thank you for today.

3936
03:11:00,700 --> 03:11:00,920
Thank you for today.

3937
03:11:04,950 --> 03:11:05,450
Energy.

3938
03:11:06,850 --> 03:11:07,350
Motivation.

3939
03:11:09,050 --> 03:11:09,550
Money.

3940
03:11:09,830 --> 03:11:10,490
Oh my gosh.

3941
03:11:10,570 --> 03:11:11,410
It's already June.

3942
03:11:15,790 --> 03:11:16,290
Nice.

3943
03:11:21,930 --> 03:11:23,430
We didn't even lose that much money.

3944
03:11:25,810 --> 03:11:27,210
Saves come from the big bottle.

3945
03:11:27,370 --> 03:11:28,690
Yeah, we'll have to get the big bottle.

3946
03:11:28,870 --> 03:11:30,850
Actually, let's do gambling one more time.

3947
03:11:31,990 --> 03:11:32,830
Gamble, gamble.

3948
03:11:33,510 --> 03:11:34,350
Gamble, gamble.

3949
03:11:35,290 --> 03:11:36,090
Come on, guys.

3950
03:11:36,170 --> 03:11:36,450
Come on.

3951
03:11:36,530 --> 03:11:37,390
Pray, pray, pray.

3952
03:11:37,630 --> 03:11:38,430
Pray for us.

3953
03:11:38,470 --> 03:11:39,070
Pray for us.

3954
03:11:39,590 --> 03:11:40,030
Pray.

3955
03:11:46,380 --> 03:11:46,820
What?

3956
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:51,120
You guys prayed.

3957
03:11:52,400 --> 03:11:54,220
This is because of you.

3958
03:11:56,320 --> 03:11:59,160
What's the most that you guys have seen someone win in the gambling?

3959
03:12:03,310 --> 03:12:05,570
What's the most you've seen that someone has won?

3960
03:12:06,630 --> 03:12:07,610
That was awesome.

3961
03:12:08,190 --> 03:12:08,630
Hahaha.

3962
03:12:09,870 --> 03:12:10,350
Yippee.

3963
03:12:13,390 --> 03:12:14,710
Didn't know you were playing this game.

3964
03:12:14,770 --> 03:12:15,450
I'll have to watch the archive.

3965
03:12:15,870 --> 03:12:16,130
Yeah.

3966
03:12:18,130 --> 03:12:18,990
It's been fun.

3967
03:12:19,050 --> 03:12:19,670
It's been a lot of fun.

3968
03:12:20,230 --> 03:12:20,710
40K.

3969
03:12:20,870 --> 03:12:21,290
Wow.

3970
03:12:21,750 --> 03:12:22,690
Good night.

3971
03:12:23,890 --> 03:12:24,850
Good night.

3972
03:12:28,670 --> 03:12:30,770
I got 26K earlier.

3973
03:12:31,410 --> 03:12:31,890
70K?

3974
03:12:32,030 --> 03:12:32,590
No way.

3975
03:12:33,890 --> 03:12:34,370
125K?

3976
03:12:34,510 --> 03:12:35,070
Are you lying?

3977
03:12:35,070 --> 03:12:35,410
I'm not lying.

3978
03:12:41,660 --> 03:12:42,960
What happens if you...

3979
03:12:42,960 --> 03:12:45,380
Oh, I guess if you go broke, you have to work...

3980
03:12:45,740 --> 03:12:48,480
You have to do the dispatch and sleep, right?

3981
03:12:48,620 --> 03:12:49,980
Your overworked body.

3982
03:12:55,370 --> 03:12:56,850
No, we've been playing it safe, though.

3983
03:12:57,730 --> 03:12:58,090
So...

3984
03:12:59,270 --> 03:13:01,410
Maybe we got to go bigger on the gifts, right?

3985
03:13:02,050 --> 03:13:06,250
Maybe I got to get the luxury bag so that she'll love me and let me take pictures of her.

3986
03:13:06,750 --> 03:13:07,430
I don't know.

3987
03:13:07,810 --> 03:13:08,170
But...

3988
03:13:09,390 --> 03:13:11,010
We'll figure it out next time.

3989
03:13:11,010 --> 03:13:12,810
How long is this game, I wonder?

3990
03:13:12,990 --> 03:13:13,530
I'm so...

3991
03:13:14,910 --> 03:13:17,450
I feel like there's so much that I haven't seen yet.

3992
03:13:18,870 --> 03:13:20,210
But we'll play it next time.

3993
03:13:21,270 --> 03:13:22,130
Yes, yes, yes.

3994
03:13:22,370 --> 03:13:23,670
Go big or go home.

3995
03:13:23,850 --> 03:13:24,770
Go big or go home.

3996
03:13:26,730 --> 03:13:29,230
Everyone, sorry for leaving a little bit early.

3997
03:13:29,710 --> 03:13:32,390
My head is starting to become pain.

3998
03:13:32,790 --> 03:13:34,450
So, I'm going to go to sleep.

3999
03:13:36,290 --> 03:13:36,750
Tomorrow.

4000
03:13:37,850 --> 03:13:38,930
What am I doing tomorrow?

4001
03:13:39,990 --> 03:13:41,250
Tomorrow, I am...

4002
03:13:43,090 --> 03:13:43,890
Thank you!

4003
03:13:44,990 --> 03:13:47,590
Rabbit House from Gucci Uso is much different than I remember.

4004
03:13:47,790 --> 03:13:48,590
Thanks for the stream.

4005
03:13:48,710 --> 03:13:49,870
Also, 200k soon.

4006
03:13:50,650 --> 03:13:51,450
Soon, maybe.

4007
03:13:52,430 --> 03:13:53,410
We'll see, we'll see.

4008
03:13:55,870 --> 03:14:01,030
Actually, I noticed that, like, so many of my followers on Twitter...

4009
03:14:01,030 --> 03:14:02,650
Like, I lost so many followers.

4010
03:14:03,250 --> 03:14:04,150
It was like...

4011
03:14:04,150 --> 03:14:05,310
It's like 10,000.

4012
03:14:05,310 --> 03:14:06,290
I was wondering.

4013
03:14:06,430 --> 03:14:08,210
I was like, oh my gosh, did I get canceled or something?

4014
03:14:08,210 --> 03:14:09,090
Why is it...

4015
03:14:09,090 --> 03:14:09,510
Why?

4016
03:14:09,710 --> 03:14:11,150
But I guess maybe it's bots.

4017
03:14:11,290 --> 03:14:12,470
Oh, tomorrow I'm doing mahjong.

4018
03:14:12,770 --> 03:14:13,290
Yeah.

4019
03:14:13,850 --> 03:14:14,670
Mahjong tomorrow.

4020
03:14:16,690 --> 03:14:18,430
So, I'll do my best.

4021
03:14:18,670 --> 03:14:20,610
Hopefully, my brain won't be too empty.

4022
03:14:21,290 --> 03:14:21,810
But...

4023
03:14:23,010 --> 03:14:24,890
We shall see.

4024
03:14:25,090 --> 03:14:26,270
But I want blue archive.

4025
03:14:26,930 --> 03:14:27,450
So...

4026
03:14:30,410 --> 03:14:30,930
Otsuminto.

4027
03:14:31,070 --> 03:14:31,910
Mint canceled.

4028
03:14:32,910 --> 03:14:33,950
Mint canceled.

4029
03:14:35,650 --> 03:14:36,970
And maybe it's bots.

4030
03:14:37,290 --> 03:14:38,050
I don't know.

4031
03:14:38,050 --> 03:14:38,190
I don't know.

4032
03:14:38,190 --> 03:14:39,610
But I noticed this morning.

4033
03:14:39,730 --> 03:14:40,090
I was like, whoa.

4034
03:14:40,390 --> 03:14:43,570
Because I saw that I was at like 144.

4035
03:14:44,610 --> 03:14:46,690
And then now I'm at like 135.

4036
03:14:50,390 --> 03:14:51,450
So, it's like crazy.

4037
03:14:55,410 --> 03:14:56,910
They discovered you smell.

4038
03:14:57,670 --> 03:14:58,150
No.

4039
03:14:59,270 --> 03:14:59,750
No.

4040
03:14:59,910 --> 03:15:02,670
I have to think of something to do for 200K though.

4041
03:15:04,070 --> 03:15:06,290
I didn't think of anything for 100K.

4042
03:15:06,290 --> 03:15:09,150
So, I have to think of something really good for 200K.

4043
03:15:10,470 --> 03:15:14,310
But I think I still have a little bit of time to think of something.

4044
03:15:14,490 --> 03:15:14,850
So...

4045
03:15:16,110 --> 03:15:16,770
I'll try.

4046
03:15:18,150 --> 03:15:18,990
Think of something.

4047
03:15:22,570 --> 03:15:22,970
Anyway.

4048
03:15:24,510 --> 03:15:25,590
I'm gonna go to bed now.

4049
03:15:27,050 --> 03:15:27,450
Otsuminto.

4050
03:15:31,540 --> 03:15:31,940
Otsuminto.

4051
03:15:32,320 --> 03:15:33,720
You ego searching, huh?

4052
03:15:33,820 --> 03:15:34,200
Oh, yeah.

4053
03:15:34,260 --> 03:15:37,100
Going to my own profile is totally ego searching.

4054
03:15:37,200 --> 03:15:37,940
Yes, thank you.

4055
03:15:40,400 --> 03:15:40,840
Gosh.

4056
03:15:42,280 --> 03:15:44,860
Actually, you can't even ego search my name.

4057
03:15:44,960 --> 03:15:45,600
Because you know what?

4058
03:15:45,620 --> 03:15:47,960
If you search mint, all you get is a bunch of cryptocurrency.

4059
03:15:48,400 --> 03:15:50,240
So, I can't even ego search me.

4060
03:15:55,340 --> 03:15:56,780
All you get is crypto.

4061
03:16:00,780 --> 03:16:01,560
It's impossible.

4062
03:16:05,080 --> 03:16:05,520
Okay.

4063
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:06,600
Otsumito.

4064
03:16:09,880 --> 03:16:10,540
Bye-bye.

4065
03:16:10,560 --> 03:16:10,760
Bye-bye.

4066
03:16:10,920 --> 03:16:11,800
See you later.

4067
03:16:11,800 --> 03:16:12,460
See you tomorrow.

4068
03:16:13,180 --> 03:16:14,560
Bye-bye.

4069
03:16:14,560 --> 03:16:15,460
Bye-bye.

4070
03:16:15,460 --> 03:16:16,020
Bye-bye.

4071
03:16:16,020 --> 03:16:16,900
Bye-bye.

4072
03:16:16,920 --> 03:16:17,680
Bye-bye.
