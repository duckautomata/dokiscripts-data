1
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,060
You know that smell?

2
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,240
That's the smell of fish in the morning.

3
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,640
Moe, moe, boo.

4
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,740
Okaire no si moe, geese, and welcome to my fishing boat.

5
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,800
Where's the Mito stream that I record was web fishing over a
year ago?

6
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,900

More.

9
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,320

16
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,620
The fish...

17
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,260
I hope they don't fear me.

18
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,580
Get to watch Mint and Iron Lung.

19
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,020

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,120
I want to go.

21
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,880
I want to go see it.

22
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,180
I kind of want to replay it though.

23
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,500
Before I go see the movie, it's a refresh my memory.

24
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,000
Good evening, country, Minto, and I booze like y'all.

25
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,360
Gotta say, the fishing hour on the lake has been mighty fine
today.

26
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,820
Some big old bears caught up in some wacky worms out on my
kayak.

27
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,180
Big old 10-pounders.

28
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,060
Yee-yep.

29
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,940
Minto, any interest in playing Rainbow Six Siege?

30
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,240

Will you marry me?

41
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,360
We ain't in Alabama.

42
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,640
Spent two hours shopping for Minky in a bag supplies, only
to realize I left my wallet.

43
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
An hour away and they don't accept tap.

44
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,540
Pray I make it to the bank.

45
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,760
Oh my gosh, Evie's, no!

46
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,900
You are upset.

47
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Sounds stressful.

48
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,580
Please tell me this is a game where you are a podcaster and
you interview the fish you catch.

49
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,540
What would they say?

50
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,220
I think they'd just be like screaming.

51
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,220
They'd just be like.

52
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,460
Do they have white hair?

53
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,480
Oh, look.

54
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,360
Oh, cute.

55
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,380
I want to be a grandpa.

56
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,260
You know?

57
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,660
I want to be like...

58
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,680
I've been fishing around these parts for a good 40 years.

59
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Hold on.

60
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,200
Let's go back to the guy with the beard.

61
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,880
A fear blonde is the closest we'll get.

62
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,900
Crack the guest list for your concert.

63
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,120
I can't see it live, but I'll be streaming in.

64
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,860
Cherik, be one.

65
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,060
Thank you, Marilyn.

66
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,420
When I was a TJ...

67
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,120
Teenager, I modded Snake into the original Rainbow Six back
in, like, 1999.

68
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,020
That guy was, like, 10 pixels.

69
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,400
Blub, blub, he whispered.

70
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,040
Whoa, we can get the foal.

71
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,460
Oh, my gosh, this is so...

72
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,540
It's kind of chilly, though.

73
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,180
We should give him...

74
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,260
Oh, life vest.

75
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,060
No, this is so grandpa.

76
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,260
Oh.

77
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,900
10 pixels of fun.

78
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,680
Oh, yeah.

79
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,980
Oh, yeah.

80
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,580
Farmer John.

81
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,560
And I love we can pick our companion.

82
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,380
This is so cute.

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,580
Oh, that looks like almost a Samoyed.

84
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,140
Oh, Bassin' Hound.

85
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,800
Oh, I've always wanted a German shepherd.

86
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,660
Oh, yeah.

87
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,260
I think we'll go for...

88
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,400
This guy reminds me of Fox and the Hound.

89
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,500
Oh, he agrees.

90
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,300
Pets, pets, pets, pets.

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,660
Whoa.

92
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,580
Oh, that dog is huge.

93
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,660
Wait, I just realized.

94
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,380
Oh, here we go.

95
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,240
Do you have a favorite breed of dog?

96
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:42,260
I like German shepherds I think they're very cute I think
it's kind of basic but I love Samoids they're so stinking

97
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:52,780
cute too Corgi I love Corgi I love a she oh wait I think I
was supposed to press to fish look at the dogs cast your

species discovered my cyborg ninja helmet?

100
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,880
How am I going to be one of Vince's fans and tell her about
Zanzibar?

101
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,700
Big dog.

102
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,880
Happy fishing boss.

103
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,680
Thank you.

104
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,740
Thank you.

105
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,840
Wait, hold on.

106
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,840
Can I go down?

107
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,120
No, I can only reel in.

108
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,560
Wait.

109
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,400
I wonder if someone's gonna bite.

110
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,180
I don't have any.

111
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:31,800
Oh.

112
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,200
We got a thread fan chain.

113
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,680
I can't remember.

114
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,180
Have you been fishing in your life or after life?

115
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,340
I have been fishing in my afterlife before a storm I catch.

116
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,940
Catch your first fish.

117
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,760
I have been fishing before.

118
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,340
Wait.

119
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,440
But, I'll be honest, I don't remember having.

120
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,180
This is gonna be a relaxing stream before we play out and
wait tomorrow.

121
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,700
When did you get ears?

122
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,060
Oh!

123
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,980
I've had ears!

124
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,900
I've had ears!

125
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,440
I've had some ears, well, since, um...

126
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,880
When did I...

127
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,300
When did this outfit come out?

128
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,320
When did this outfit come out?

129
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:39,960
No, stop!

130
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,180
I don't want to get you anymore.

131
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,540
I think I'm full on fish.

132
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,120
So when I'm full...

133
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,600
Oh, I...

134
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,500
We can...

135
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,260
Return to dock when your storage is full.

136
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,500
Oh.

137
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,340
Just kidding.

138
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,160
An Ibu fishing trip.

139
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
If we...

140
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,720
Look at this.

141
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,640
This is incredible looking.

142
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,960
If we can fish in some place like this...

143
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,620
That might be the happiest ghost ever.

144
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,480
Okay.

145
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,020
My nana had a German chef when I was a little one.

146
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,040
Oh, we get paid.

147
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,180
Oh, howdy.

148
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,620
Well, hey there, bud.

149
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,580
I'm Rusty.

150
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,780
Come on in.

151
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,320
Rusty, I'd like your finest bobber.

152
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,320
All the gear is over on the right there.

153
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,560
Lures, rods, boats, and upgrades.

154
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,740
A whole shebang.

155
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,180
All if you need a hand or a good story.

156
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,980
I got both in spades.

157
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,100
Good story, please.

158
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,500
How much for a story?

159
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,680
Appreciate it, bud.

160
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,380
I didn't know that was a tip jar.

161
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,040
Well, where's the story?

162
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,720
Give me the story I paid.

163
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,220
I paid for your time.

164
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:02,900
Rusty.

165
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,120
Rusty.

166
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,480
No!

167
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,180
I had 15!

168
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,250
15!

169
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,390
Can I just reach right in there?

170
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,690
I just got back from Japan!

171
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,910
and finally watch it live, got a bunch of Hanamaru Obake
merch all thanking of you!

172
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,750
I love a Hanamaru Obake, I love Hanamaru!

173
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,150
Hands in spades.

174
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,730
Minto, that's me!

175
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,710
Back in the day, we'd use a chunk of burger and a sock
and...

176
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,150
Wait, what?

177
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,330
To get leeches for fish bait.

178
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,330
You could also just use your...

179
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,370
Wait, I can't tell if you're kidding or not, Kinky.

180
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,370
Tell me a story, VTuber.

181
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,310
Ugh.

182
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,950
The story is...

183
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,570
Uh...

184
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,580
Never give up your lucky penny.

185
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,540
Wait, that's like an advice.

186
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,640
What's a story?

187
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,680
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm trying to think of one that
I've never told before.

188
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,620
You could tell me.

189
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,460
an old one too?

190
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,240
You've told a lot of stories.

191
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,640
I'm a bit of a storyteller.

192
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,760
I have told quite a bit.

193
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,380
New species!

194
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:53,860
Come on.

195
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,920
That guy.

196
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:55,700
Oh, sorry.

197
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,440
I'm blocking him.

198
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,180
Oh, he just barely...

199
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,700
He, like, grazed my... Oh, he's going back for it.

200
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, he just missed it.

201
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,160
Oh, they're all...

202
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,920
They're all in on my... Oh, there we go!

203
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,590
Blue gill sunfish.

204
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:22,110
I wonder when we'll, I guess if we upgrade our boat, will we
get more, uh, what's the word?

205
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,610
More space.

206
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:31,990
You know, I was gonna not have my hair up today because I
thought it might get in the way.

207
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,470
Have you guys seen the fish?

208
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,750
I feel like I'm right.

209
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:35,730
Oh.

210
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,270
I'll make it a bit smaller.

211
00:15:45,210 --> 00:16:04,600
will shrink my twin tails for today you sure can spin a yarn
miss me too so how you guys doing how you guys doing I took

212
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:16,860
off my wig I had a big old wig on the hat needs to be bigger
oh yeah the hats not even blocking anything right are there

213
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,720
any fish over here?

214
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,380
Oh, here they come.

215
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,800
Here they come.

216
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,460
Wait, we haven't caught this guy yet.

217
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,820
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

218
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,920
No, no, stay away, stay away.

219
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,000
Stay away, stay away.

220
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,320
You're afraid of my cursor.

221
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:27,960
Yeah, yeah, see?

222
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,820
They're afraid of my cursor.

223
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,480
No, you.

224
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,260
Turn around, turn around.

225
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,280
I'm willing it.

226
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,060
I'm willing it.

227
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,400
Worked out today.

228
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,500
Feeling a bit worn out.

229
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,100
Oh, no!

230
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,700
I mean, that's good to work out, though.

231
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,060
Oh, come on.

232
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,200
No, stay away, stay away.

233
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,200
You, you, you, you, you.

234
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,680
Turn around.

235
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm willing it into existence.

236
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,140
Oh.

237
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,640
We gave up.

238
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,900
I was being serious.

239
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,480
That's the easiest way to catch leeches.

240
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,040
Walleyes love leeches too.

241
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,320
It's the best bait for them.

242
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,980
No kidding.

243
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,520
Wait, where am I going?

244
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,840
Grandpa, stop.

245
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,480
Grandpa, let's fish right here.

246
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,760
Nah.

247
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,900
Yeah, everybody stay warm if you're, like, in a park that's
getting...

248
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,080
Oh, there's a fish over there.

249
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,120
Yeah, a new species.

250
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,180
You're in a park that's got a lot of...

251
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,180
Whoa.

252
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,480
Wait!

253
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,140
That's a huge guy!

254
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,280
Mint immensely loves...

255
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,460
Wait.

256
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,120
Oh, yes!

257
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,320
Oh, yeah!

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,560
No!

259
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,860
We did a bicker rod to catch that guy!

260
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,620
Oh, man.

261
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,360
It was crazy, wasn't it?

262
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,560
Alright, let's go home.

263
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,860
Used a fish to catch another fish.

264
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,640
Now we're thinking with portals.

265
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,760
Speaking of portal, I've been thinking about portal 2
earlier today.

266
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,460
So backing up a little bit more.

267
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:38,000
Last night we had like a meeting and like a Denzetsu meeting
and I got some more information on some times that I would

268
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
be...

269
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,880
That I would be away on trip.

270
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,140
Let's see, I like this guy.

271
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,700
Best for brown trout.

272
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,680
Oh, I need a bigger...

273
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,940
How much is a bigger rod?

274
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:13,320
and i asked for like suggestions of what kind of games so i
want to not only just stream while i'm away but also for

275
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:21,180
days that i can't stream if there's like you know maybe a
consecutive number of days or something to have a sort of

276
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:28,640
let's play that i can put up still rambler.

277
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,300
Grab a fishing license.

278
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:38,220
Grabbing a fishing license lets you unlock new waters to
fish, because the best lunkers don't hang out by the dock.

279
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:38,980
Dang.

280
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,500
Grizzly Ridge!

281
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,220
But, um...

282
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,220
So, but I asked for some suggestions, and someone said
Portal 2, and I was like, you know, that might be fine, but

283
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,560
a lot of people suggested Zelda!

284
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:02,720
Like, because I've never played, like, an Ocarina of Time or
Majora's Mask, I didn't have a Nintendo 64 and then I just

285
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:12,220
never got around to playing it when to win it came out on
the DS and everything too.

286
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,380
So it would be like a first time playthrough but...

287
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,340
Thank you!

288
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,900
I haven't told you that I've been housing three cats in my
garage to help them escape the cold.

289
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,160
When I become so attached to me that she grabs my pan legs
with her claws.

290
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:41,620
if I leave with petting her without petting her enough I
might try to adopt her soon sounds so cute but for Zelda my

291
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:52,440
thing was I don't know if I would complete the game I don't
know if I could complete the game before I before I leave

292
00:20:52,440 --> 00:21:03,740
and then also I think I would have more more videos than I
would have um then I would have days that I'm not streaming

293
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:17,420
because I looked into it I was like oh my gosh this game
says it's like 25 hours to beat or something crazy hmm I was

294
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,200
like whoa

295
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:28,050
without chat's help well I don't want to be backseated
through it let's get

296
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,570
We already got the blue gill...

297
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,650
Wait, nobody can...

298
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,530
Oh yeah, wait.

299
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,990
We got the blue...

300
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,310
gill sunfish.

301
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,490
Okay, yeah, yeah, I thought so.

302
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,370
We already got that guy, so let's uh...

303
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,250
Oh, whoops.

304
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,250
Let's get this.

305
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,870
And then we'll save up for...

306
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,830
the Maple Scout.

307
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,670
Oh, I can upgrade my rod strength!

308
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,210
Oh, wait, though, wait, though, wait, though, wait, though,
wait, though.

309
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,230
We should do that.

310
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,910
Nah, I'm kind of...

311
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,110
I can't...

312
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,930
Be too mad about my trip.

313
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:14,910
Because...

314
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,270
It's a lot of cool stuff that's coming up.

315
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,370
But at the same time...

316
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,030
My trip was originally...

317
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,530
For...

318
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,230
Like, it was truly a vacation.

319
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,170
And then it got completely different.

320
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,010
taken over.

321
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,430
uh, by, like, many things.

322
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,830
Which is fine.

323
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,810
Like, I'm not, I'm not complaining.

324
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,230
Because they're cool things.

325
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,970
And even while I'm away, I'll have cool things going on.

326
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,810
So, you know.

327
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:54,550
Oh.

328
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,440
But.

329
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,540
But.

330
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,300
Oh.

331
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,880
There's water there's.

332
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,560
There's been like kind of, it's kind of has exploded.

333
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:18,440
Like I was even telling like Steiner, my manager this
morning, I was like, I never, ever get like opportunities

334
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,460
like this ever.

335
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,840
And now all of a sudden it's like, and I'm like, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

336
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,100
I'm like, I'm truly feeling the suffering from success at
the moment.

337
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:40,760
I was like, this is, I think this is actual suffering from
success.

338
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,860
And let me also say, because my, okay.

339
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,480
My trip was originally.

340
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,620
My trip was originally.

341
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,340
What am I?

342
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,000
Okay.

343
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,220
One of my idolosies.

344
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,440
Her birthday is in Japan.

345
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:17,720
January but she's been but for the past two years her
birthday shows have been in uh have been in March so I was

346
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:25,060
like okay they'll probably do March again this year and then
also another oh she she announced her retirement and I was

347
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:32,240
like well she's she'll not be an idol anymore and she said
that it would be in March so I was like okay maybe I can hit

348
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:45,700
two birds with one stone And then, my Oshi was like, my
birthday, we're celebrating it in January this year.

349
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,740
And I was like, oh, no, that's fine.

350
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,960
What about the other one?

351
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:56,080
And then the other one, her, she's doing the thing, the
graduation, and it's after CarrierCon.

352
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,760
So I won't even be there.

353
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,680
And I'm like, ah!

354
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,440
So my two original reasons for even trying to set up the...

355
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:21,400
trip we're totally thrown out it's so unlucky yeah it ended
up being a little bit unlucky but wait oh I'm full just

356
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:29,520
kidding I'm full I know I'm kind of like going for a smaller
fish right now but we're just trying to get our money up a

357
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:40,960
little bit yeah so it ended up like first of all it ended up
being that the events didn't work out but i guess it's a

358
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:49,600
good thing the events didn't work out because at the same
time i would have been so busy with all the work and then

359
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,260
also oh she cat so i guess it works out i love that you can
pet Your dog.

360
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,440
Yeah, you could pet the dog.

361
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,500
Sorry, Minto.

362
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,940
It's all good.

363
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,740
I'm just being a little whiny, right?

364
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,780
I'm just being a little whiny.

365
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:10,880
No.

366
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,440
Oh, my God.

367
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,800
Look how cute he is as he looks in the water.

368
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,140
Is this a good spot, boy?

369
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,400
Is this a good spot?

370
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,360
Yeah?

371
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,160
Oh, change the lure.

372
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,480
Oh, I forgot to change it.

373
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,340
I'm so stupid.

374
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,520
I need some cheese for all this wine.

375
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,400
Whoa, we're going deep.

376
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,820
We're going down, damn.

377
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,240
No, no, you're too big, I think.

378
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,680
Don't touch my rod.

379
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,120
Don't touch.

380
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,420
Don't touch my rod yet.

381
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,400
Or my line.

382
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,540
I always release back the fish when I'm fishing, but
sometimes the hook gets into their eyes and they get brain

383
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:56,980
damage.

384
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,220
I saw that, like, you can't...

385
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,320
Uh...

386
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,880
We got the smallmouth bears!

387
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,160
I heard that, like, even the catching fish and releasing
them?

388
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,240
I guess it depends on... how...

389
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,260
um...

390
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,800
how they're caught, but I heard that they just don't also
survive.

391
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,540
Is that true?

392
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,510
It depends on the species of fish.

393
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,890
I see.

394
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,770
It depends on the fish.

395
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,590
Oh, wait, no, this side.

396
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,530
I do this side so you guys can see.

397
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,330
It's depending on the fish and how they were handled.

398
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,090
So if I take my trophy shot, they won't live.

399
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,770
If I man...

400
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,910
Oh, this guy looks tiny.

401
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,090
If I manhandle him a little bit, they won't live.

402
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,530
What happened to my fish?

403
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,870
I thought I caught three.

404
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,090
Trophy shot is deadly to fish.

405
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,470
That's so sad.

406
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,270
Come on, big boy.

407
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,910
Don't you want a taste?

408
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,890
Don't you want a taste of my lure?

409
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,950
They swallow the hook.

410
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,250
Oh my gosh, it's so sad.

411
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,910
Well, we're selling these fish.

412
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,350
So I guess it doesn't matter.

413
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,550
I suppose it doesn't really matter, because we know that
they are dead dead.

414
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,990
I wonder what you do with these guys.

415
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,150
I gutted one that had, like, two extra hooks inside.

416
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,790
Holy moly.

417
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:55,850
Eight!

418
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:56,590
Oh, nine!

419
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,150
Ten!

420
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,290
Oh, my gosh!

421
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:00,990
Nice!

422
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,290
Nice.

423
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,090
Oh, we're already halfway there to a new rod.

424
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:06,970
Let's go.

425
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,430
I want to see if we can go further out.

426
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,450
I want to see how far we can go.

427
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,320
I want to collect all the fish.

428
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,280
I want to collect every fish.

429
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:31,920
Yeah.

430
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,000
How are you guys doing?

431
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,040
How's your week?

432
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,760
Besides, maybe cold for some of you guys.

433
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,260
Okay, we're going to...

434
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,240
Oh, dear!

435
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:45,860
Cute.

436
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,780
Oh wait, sorry.

437
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,840
I'm totally blocking him.

438
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,200
Uh, how can I...

439
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,420
Where can I move to?

440
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,080
Here?

441
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,300
This probably works.

442
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,480
This probably works.

443
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,830
Been all right.

444
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:09,850
Yeah.

445
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,430
Just all right.

446
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,410
Just all right.

447
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,550
I right there.

448
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:32,790
started umma oh nice like the game or the anime um searching
for a job very good look at the size of this guy holy moly

449
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:52,330
honestly some days i'm just like i'm ready to just move out
into the into the wilderness like this and and be efficient.

450
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,110
I saw an art book the other day and can't decide if I should
get it so I'll ask my kamiyoshi if I should.

451
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,510
Well, I do like some art.

452
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,050
I do like the arts.

453
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:06,870
Oh, come on!

454
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,830
No bites!

455
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,120
Wait.

456
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,200
Let's try a different lure of fish.

457
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,060
aren't interested.

458
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,440
Yeah, but I want to move.

459
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,220
I wish I could move without...

460
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,380
Um...

461
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,380
Oh, there we go.

462
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,780
That's why I couldn't move.

463
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,860
Hope to let out the...

464
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,360
Huh?

465
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,960
I am.

466
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,980
Can I move now?

467
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,420
No!

468
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,500
It's not letting me use the arrow keys.

469
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,580
We'll see if I get somebody to bite in this time.

470
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,640
But you get what I mean, though?

471
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,120
Sometimes you're just like, man, time to live off the land.

472
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,260
I don't know.

473
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,680
I know some people really like living in cities more,
though.

474
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,500
They're like, I don't want to live off the land.

475
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,800
I want to go to the grocery store and buy carrots.

476
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,450
I don't.

477
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,770
Yeah, I don't want to Stardew Valley.

478
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,190
I want to

479
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:39,890
style queen RS Nation welcome to my bullshit black as long
as there's internet yeah yeah as long as there's internet

480
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,930
what oh there we go okay we can finally move again

481
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,580
alright let's try it right here that place was a bust

482
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:01,770
I think most people that want to fully off the grid don't
realize how much it takes to be independent.

483
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,970
I watched Breaking Bad.

484
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,670
I saw Walter White live in the cabin.

485
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,650
Julie, welcome back!

486
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,830
Thank you!

487
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,290
Oh, oh, oh, come on, come on, guy, come on, come on, guy.

488
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,130
My delicious lure!

489
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,850
It's super hard.

490
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,750
What would you say is the...

491
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:36,730
stop reeling when the fish is fighting hard oh okay my bad
what would you say is the most difficult thing of like

492
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:49,340
living off the land it's easy to take the conveniences of
modern life for granted that's so true though right food

493
00:33:49,340 --> 00:34:07,240
poop how food living off the land staying warm and food and
water Oh my gosh, I didn't even consider that water wouldn't

494
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,320
even be a thing.

495
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,840
Oh my gosh, yeah, they're like, you're living off the land.

496
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,200
Oh, I think he's going for it again.

497
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,120
Clean water, I feel like, what?

498
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,520
You just boil the water, no?

499
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,740
He's fighting, he's fighting.

500
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,840
I'm not pulling.

501
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,610
No?

502
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,030
No?

503
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,120
Oh my god, where is he going?

504
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,780
Upgrade your strength and length.

505
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,760
Dang it!

506
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,840
You need a filter.

507
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:08,620
At least Walter White had a pre-built cabin plus two copies
of Mr. Magurium Wonder Emporium.

508
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,540
Yeah, he did.

509
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,200
Oh, it is letting me use the arrow keys now.

510
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,040
I'll peek.

511
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,560
People have to dig a well.

512
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,400
I have to dig.

513
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,840
I might as well be digging my grave.

514
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,300
What the heck?

515
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,420
Here's my well and here's my pre-built grave for when I get
sick of this lifestyle.

516
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,370
City ghost.

517
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,790
I don't think I have it out.

518
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,850
I don't think I... Wait, I don't think I've cut out for it.

519
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,290
Wait, did I catch a single fish?

520
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,250
I really did.

521
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:59,210
didn't okay hold on let's maybe hey there stranger thought
you'd gone south with the geese no I just really suck at

522
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:15,450
this as fishing at this fishing thing bigger rod let's do
length and strength mint is a one-man army

523
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:31,720
have you ever had to pump water maybe yeah maybe we don't
live fully off the land maybe it's just a remote type

524
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:41,000
situation you could still I mean like I've heard of people
that live like an hour two hours from a grocery store so

525
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,160
it's inconvenient but if you have a small garden and then a
grocery store that's a little ways away.

526
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:59,460
And you still are able to you know, let's actually let's dig
up.

527
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,540
Let's go a little bit more to the right.

528
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,560
No Trader Joe's.

529
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,840
You guys know that.

530
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,360
What's it?

531
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,760
Oh gosh.

532
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,440
What's it called?

533
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:16,360
There's like a really fancy like um grocery store.

534
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,980
I think it's only in California.

535
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,060
Of course it is.

536
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:27,540
But like, they were, they sometimes like, I'll see some of
their things kind of go viral because it's so ridiculous.

537
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,160
They'll sell like a strawberry for like $30.

538
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,500
Erewhon!

539
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,100
Yeah!

540
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:32,820
Erewhon!

541
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,640
Have you guys heard of that place before?

542
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Well, clearly some of you have, but oh my gosh.

543
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,620
It's nuts!

544
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,260
Erewhon.

545
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:56,560
And they'll be like, haven't it's exactly as i'm describing
it's like so crazy high priced it's as long as you have

546
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:10,180
wally world you are safe i don't think i don't think this
guy likes my lure wait come on come on oh oh what the no

547
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,940
please stop taking fight

548
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,000
We might get him.

549
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,300
No, stop taking my lion!

550
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,620
Wait, we might get him, though.

551
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,200
We might get him.

552
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,200
You have to know when to...

553
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,040
Oh, dang it!

554
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,400
I was not reeling.

555
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,140
Maybe another guy will catch it, though.

556
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
These guys are aggressive.

557
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,500
They're a fighter.

558
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,620
Oh.

559
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,970
I wasn't even...

560
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,970
You guys, I wasn't even pressing...

561
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,190
I wasn't even...

562
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,150
What's the word?

563
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:07,610
Sure.

564
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,150
I'll take anybody that I can get right now.

565
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,770
Oh wait, we never caught this guy, a brown trout.

566
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:16,750
Nice.

567
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,370
Sure you could, Minto, but you'd have to cook.

568
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,090
I don't know how to cook!

569
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,380
California slander.

570
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,440
That's not California, just Los Angeles.

571
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,200
Oh yeah?

572
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,520
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

573
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,940
Oh, that guy seemed interesting.

574
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,540
Everyone's okay with L.A.

575
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,300
Slander, though.

576
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,540
I don't know.

577
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,980
I kind of, I remember, I think it was last year, Anime Expo.

578
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
I think it was Matara.

579
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,580
She was like, we gotta go to Erewhon.

580
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,900
We just gotta, we just gotta see what it's like.

581
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,380
We gotta see what's going on there.

582
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:02,900
Um.

583
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,380
Wait.

584
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,860
Oh, wait.

585
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,660
We might get this guy.

586
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,820
Oh, I might have him.

587
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,460
I might have him.

588
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,700
Yeah!

589
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,160
We finally go.

590
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:19,950
Nice.

591
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,810
I'm curious what it's like.

592
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,050
Has anybody ever been?

593
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,950
I guess some people, if you live in California,

594
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,350
celebratory banjo.

595
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,160
Pretty much a Gucci Whole Foods.

596
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,520
Desperate to be scammed.

597
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,860
No, I don't want to buy anything.

598
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:57,000
I just want to go and look at the prices and be like, woof.

599
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,820
Yikes.

600
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,360
You know?

601
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,800
I once was trying to get, what's it called?

602
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,280
Like a nice bag for my mom.

603
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,340
I was like, you know what?

604
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:21,300
I think it was, I usually go to like an outlet mall and get
her like a, uh, what's the word?

605
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,460
Oh, what's the brand?

606
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,240
Oh my gosh.

607
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,480
Coach?

608
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,620
I usually go to like an outlet mall and get her a coach bag.

609
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,540
But I was like, you know what?

610
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,420
I always get coach bag.

611
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:38,800
I'm gonna go to, uh, to Gucci.

612
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,700
I wanna, you know, maybe I'll go get a Gucci bag.

613
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,360
I went in that store and...

614
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,080
Holy cow!

615
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,520
Reminder that supermarkets didn't exist yet.

616
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,140
And indoor plumbing and electricity weren't a widespread
thing yet a hundred years ago.

617
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,580
Wait, that's also crazy.

618
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,740
I kind of like, I like kind of stood in the...

619
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,200
First of all, there was a line to get into the store.

620
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,320
I had to wait in a line like I was on an amusement park
ride.

621
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
It was so...

622
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:23,660
is this you should have matara get you a discount on a roach
bag yeah it was like craziness i was like what the heck is

623
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:30,360
this so it was a line to get into the gucci store and then i
go in and i'm like i like i was like oh this bag is pretty

624
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:38,900
cute and i pick it up and i was like this is outlet gucci
this is outlet pricing and i kind of like just

625
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,080
You know, obviously the meme that's like, they don't know
I'm blank.

626
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,980
I was like in the corner of the store and I was like, they
don't know I'm poor.

627
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,540
But maybe they could tell.

628
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,300
I'm sure they have senses about that.

629
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,560
I'm sure they're like.

630
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm sure they're like.

631
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,240
They're probably like, oh, this girl can't afford anything
here.

632
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,200
They could tell.

633
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,340
Yeah, well, it's not like, you know, it's just, I just can't
fathom.

634
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,180
them spending that much on a bag.

635
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,300
Any plans to play the Indiana Jones DLC I saw a demo for a
game called Roommates, Romance and Ringing Hearts, which I

636
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:23,880
think you'll like.

637
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,880
It's a live-action romance sim with cute...

638
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,380
Oh, I know that game.

639
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,180
I know that game.

640
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,020
Wait, we could play that.

641
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,420
I've been wanting to act normal, act normal.

642
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:42,420
I guess if you're already at a outlet Gucci store, there's
probably some judgment.

643
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,600
I'm not judging anybody going to an outlet store.

644
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,220
I am the person that goes to the outlet store.

645
00:43:51,020 --> 00:44:02,540
But I'm meaning that the employees might be the ones that
are like, Yes, yes, you are at the outlet, Gucci.

646
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:05,900
Oh my goodness.

647
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,020
I am the one who thrifts.

648
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,160
Cheesecake!

649
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,780
Welcome back, thank you!

650
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,320
Come on, come on.

651
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,880
I think we got him.

652
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,100
No, no, stop fighting.

653
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,260
Stop fighting.

654
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,580
They are working there.

655
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,380
Why would they judge?

656
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,540
You'd be surprised.

657
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,120
Like, people that work in bougie places, like they have
the...

658
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,680
I mean, sometimes.

659
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,740
I'm not trying to...

660
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,200
What's the word?

661
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,340
Have you heard about the Birken shaming ritual?

662
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,760
I know about Birken.

663
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:57,460
in bags that is if you guys don't know okay so burkin bags
first of all you have to be invited to buy one of these bags

664
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:08,020
invite you you have to be invited you have to be given
permission to buy a burkin bag and then and then they're

665
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:25,180
like 30 000 like actual ridiculous the the craziest pricing
ever like and then you and then i guess from my

666
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:35,140
understanding is like you also don't get to pick what bag
you buy like you are invited to buy the berkin bag and then

667
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:42,080
they're like okay we're allowing you to buy this bag

668
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,260
You're just SOL?

669
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,580
What if it's a terrible ugly bag?

670
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,300
It's so bizarre.

671
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,000
It's so strange.

672
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,460
I'm gonna try this Bobber for a bit.

673
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,080
It's just like Ferrari.

674
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,340
Is that really the same?

675
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,540
There's a...

676
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,880
I think it's Ferrari.

677
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:20,800
There is a theme park that's based off that is like some
luxury Some luxury car brand.

678
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,920
I think it's Ferrari.

679
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,620
Survive the layoffs at work today.

680
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,200
Now I have to go to the office tomorrow instead of
finishing.

681
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,240
Oh, well, I'm really glad you survived the layoffs.

682
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,560
La boo bag.

683
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,400
It is Ferrari.

684
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

685
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,620
It looks really fine.

686
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,940
It looks like a really good theme park.

687
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,920
I'm not even into cars, but I'm kind of like...

688
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,900
And they show kind of a little bit...

689
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:55,880
of like okay this game is frustrating me because i'm trying
to move to a different location and it's just maybe i don't

690
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:09,060
know how to play but it's in saudi arabia oh they there's
another theme park that opened recently in saudi arabia that

691
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:20,000
has like the world's like the world's largest it's It's the
world's fastest and maybe the largest drop in the world.

692
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,250
The Mr. Beast theme park.

693
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:29,710
No.

694
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:34,250
No, no, not the Mr. Beast theme park.

695
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,150
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

696
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:37,990
Actually, go back, go back.

697
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:42,530
Maybe we buy another... Oh wait, I think I wanted to buy
another bobber and...

698
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,270
There we go, thank you!

699
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,730
I think I wanted to buy another bobber and I said I needed
to upgrade my rod first.

700
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,670
Yeah, another bigger rod.

701
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,470
Oh, wait, this one.

702
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,890
Walleye and question mark, question mark.

703
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:03,350
Hmm.

704
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,680
I thought the Mr. Beastland was temporary.

705
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,560
Is it still there?

706
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,900
Is it still there?

707
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,780
Is Haneda tickets worth paying extra for first Japan visit
instead of Narita?

708
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,780
I would say it depends.

709
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:32,960
on how much more expensive it is but getting to main Tokyo
from Haneda is way easier than getting to main Tokyo from

710
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:53,780
Narita and the airport is nicer it was just a month that's
insane that's crazy it was just a month what the hell I'm

711
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,160
Almost...

712
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:00,280
This one, I feel like we should just save up for the 8 plus
pound, you know?

713
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,820
The timber jack.

714
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,480
But at the same time, I'm also like, I want to get all the
upgrades, you know what I mean?

715
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,110
But Narita is named for Narita Top Road.

716
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:28,570
But Narita is bad airport.

717
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,690
You can upgrade your storage space too.

718
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:32,750
Oh, is it this one?

719
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:33,810
No, this is licensing.

720
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:35,890
My boat?

721
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:37,930
Is that... Oh, my boat...

722
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:38,410
No.

723
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,650
I can't... Oh, wait, here!

724
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:41,250
Ah, fish storage!

725
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,210
Okay, we'll buy... We'll buy so we can hold four fish now.

726
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:45,850
Thank you.

727
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:47,990
And then...

728
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,830
Let's go fishing.

729
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:57,450
You think Ferrari Land has a fer- Fer- Fer- Fer- Fer- Ferris
wheel?

730
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,750
It, uh, it does have, um...

731
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,050
It has like...

732
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,650
I can't remember what it...

733
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:13,830
It has like some weird observation rooftop.

734
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,350
And you can... I don't know.

735
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,690
I've been... I've like...

736
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,870
Wanted to go, but obviously...

737
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,350
When the hell am I ever gonna...

738
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:25,990
Get... Get to Saudi Arabia.

739
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,010
Ferraris, Ferraris wheel.

740
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,590
I'm gonna...

741
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:36,130
I'm gonna switch my...

742
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:36,870
There we go.

743
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,210
Spins as fast as a Ferrari wheel.

744
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,970
Hold on, folks.

745
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,170
That'd be wild.

746
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:51,810
Oh, oh.

747
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,930
Yeah, come on.

748
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,200
I think we got him.

749
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,120
Easy.

750
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:11,150
Yeah.

751
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,410
I just want to go to theme park.

752
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,550
I just want to go to theme park.

753
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:34,390
Ferrari world looks so fine but if they give me a free
Ferrari I'll give you guys a ride oh shoot I forgot oh my

754
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:47,470
bad I only say good morning when I'm fishing because that's
the only time it is a good morning right a free Rari if you

755
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:52,490
guys like the demo cars like in a showroom and you're just
like wow!

756
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:54,430
Car of the future!

757
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,270
When will they sell this?

758
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:02,410
And they're like 2,000 and 100.

759
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:04,810
And you're like, oh okay.

760
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:08,910
Sure.

761
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,850
If they ever, I know.

762
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:20,230
It's Like this is a car that we might have in the future.

763
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:22,450
And I'm like, this ain't the Jetsons.

764
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,570
Like, stop making cars that you can't produce.

765
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,410
You're getting my hopes up.

766
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,890
I dream of owning a K-truck, not a Ferrari.

767
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:40,090
Yeah, K-truck, so cute.

768
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:43,330
It's called a concept.

769
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,650
It's called a tease, that's what it is.

770
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,390
It's called a tease.

771
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,030
Thinking about test track, like the ride of Disney?

772
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,290
Oh, nice!

773
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:57,390
We got that guy easy.

774
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:58,930
Alright, let's head back.

775
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:04,610
Easy delivery co-stream.

776
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,130
I know that in the United States.

777
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:12,330
K-trucks are not allowed in everywhere because they're not
like, I guess.

778
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:20,390
They're like, if you have a K-truck, you will become an
accordion if you get hit.

779
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:31,610
And what I say to that is Vote for me for president Because
I will make Everybody have a K truck So then nobody will

Weeks of ideas.

791
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,430
Weeks of ideas.

Doki bird.

797

Minto of the lake, what is your wisdom?

798
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,320
Don't think.

Holy cow.

804
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,710
These guys are nuts.

805
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,750
These guys are so nuts.

806
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:14,750
Yeah,

807
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,900

00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,820
Yeah, yeah, go back to my boat.

809
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,220
I almost just want to do upgrades.

810
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,760
Look, like, stop!

811
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,920
I can't even work with you!

812
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:41,570
Ah.

813
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:47,150
Alright, let that, let, let the lure drip again.

814
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:48,890
Never mind, it's not going down.

815
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:50,430
They have so much fire.

816
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:51,430
They really do.

817
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,110
How many fish do I have?

818
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,370
Nod!

819
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:01,210
Counting the months till I become a rainbow eye woo.

820
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:04,350
Soon, soon, soon.

821
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:05,570
Oh.

822
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,190
That was so clean.

823
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:09,910
Oh, I have one.

824
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:10,470
Okay, good.

825
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,480
I'm not reeling, you guys.

826
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,100
You say stop reeling when there's bubbles.

827
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,760
My hand is off my mouse.

828
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,340
They just pull that hard.

829
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,560
They just pull like crazy.

830
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,860
Like I'm reeling now.

831
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,060
And then I'm not.

832
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,300
Now I'm reeling.

833
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,340
Now I'm not.

834
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,160
Now I'm reeling.

835
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,120
Now I'm not.

836
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,600
And there he goes.

837
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,860
Okay, now it's a lost cause basically.

838
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,560
You are clearly reeling.

839
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,720
Reeling with her feet.

840
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,380
I know.

841
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,820
I'm just that talented, honestly.

842
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:58,940
Oh, we might have him.

843
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,620
We might have him.

844
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,820
Come on, come on, come on.

845
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,160
Come on.

846
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:02,380
Yeah!

847
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,200
New biggest catch!

848
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,440
Nice.

849
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,600
Nice, nice, nice.

850
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:27,750
Oh, no.

851
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:28,530
See?

852
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:28,870
See?

853
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,850
My hand is off my mouse.

854
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:33,590
Phil!

855
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,530

00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,450
Thank you!

857
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:37,250
Thank you!

858
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:38,990
Thank you so much!

859
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:43,570
Free Joe!

860
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:44,850
Welcome to Babu Shop!

861
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:45,610
Thank you!

862
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,730
Thank you!

863
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:48,610
Hold on.

864
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,350
Let's uh...

865
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:51,750
Okay.

866
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:52,750
Thank you, thank you.

867
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:53,670
Dang it.

868
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:55,490
Sometimes I don't want...

869
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,630
I want to move, but the game says, no, you must fish.

870
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,150
But I want to move.

871
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,350
I want to catch this guy.

872
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:04,890
I want to catch these guys here.

873
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,990
I think this guy goes after my...

874
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,090
What does the heart say?

875
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:14,990
The heart says...

876
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:19,930
Women fear me, fish fear me, men turn their eyes away from
me as I walk.

877
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:24,070
No beast dare make a sound in my presence I am alone on this
barren earth.

878
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,040
Come on.

879
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,700
Come on.

880
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,440
Come on.

881
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,700
Come on.

882
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,360
Nope, I think it's a lost cause.

883
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,740
I'm giving up.

884
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:56,520
I'm giving up.

885
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,680
I'm pulling just so I can get it back.

886
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,720
I've never had much patience for fishing.

887
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,000
I think that means you're not old enough yet.

888
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:09,800
You know?

889
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,060
I think that means you're not old enough yet.

890
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,600
Were you influenced by other VTubers playing this?

891
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,680
I did see somebody else playing it.

892
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,820
But I was like, I just want to fish.

893
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:27,730
Let's go get some upgrades.

894
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:31,250
Let me pet my dog first.

895
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:34,230
Now we go upgrade.

896
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,270
I think...

897
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:42,090
I think old people have patience for fishing because...

898
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:47,230
Because...

899
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,570
They know that they're at the end stages.

900
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:56,190
I have patience for fishing because I'm dead and I have only
time.

901
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,470
We're at 86!

902
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:03,170
Hello!

903
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:08,050
Holy smokes, you clean out the lake or just the cocky ones.

904
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,410
I'm doing a good job out there, okay, mister?

905
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,710
I think we gotta do line strength.

906
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:21,310
It's fine.

907
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:27,710
I mean, we can switch out rods anyway, because this one's
also good for small, so we'll be using it.

908
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:28,210
I

909
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,540
guess I'm old and dying.

910
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,040
I mean, everybody's dying.

911
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,280
Except me.

912
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,920
Unless ghosts have like a...

913
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,380
I don't think they have like a...

914
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,440
No one told me.

915
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:53,960
Can I only be a ghost for a certain amount of time?

916
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,180
Are you going to eat the fish you catch?

917
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,360
What's like a good fresh water?

918
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:01,920
fish.

919
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,360
Wait, do these guys go for this lore?

920
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,040
Yes, they do.

921
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,140
Okay, nice.

922
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:13,400
Trout.

923
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,600
I don't think I've ever had a trout.

924
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,140
Oh, salmon!

925
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:20,000
For some reason, I always think salmon is a salt water fish.

926
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,220
Like, you're right.

927
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:31,080
Salmon have such fascinating lives.

928
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,280
Like, just the way... What was it?

929
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:46,420
There's like a weird there's a hold on like a weird disease
or something don't they switch can they salmon spawn in

930
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:54,100
fresh water they spawn wait hold on I'm gonna look this up
they're kind of both oh

931
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:12,970
let's see uh salmon I learned it about I learned it I
learned about this not too long ago.

932
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,550
Trying to see what it is though.

933
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:22,450
It's like basically they become like a zombie.

934
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:29,210
Yeah, it's literally called like a zombie salmon.

935
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:35,750
Maybe

936
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:40,670
it's...

937
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:41,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

938
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,030
It's freaky, right?

939
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,050
It's freaky, right?

940
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,390
Zombie salmon.

941
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:47,950
Hold on.

942
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:53,190
I don't want to I don't know if the AI overview was
accurate, so we'll just...

943
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:54,590
Oh, he's gonna fish all on his own!

944
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:54,930
Perfect!

945
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:56,190
Let's see, hold on.

946
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:01,270
Yeah, they get like...

947
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,870
Hold on.

948
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,890
Okay, they get like really freaky.

949
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,430
I'm gonna see if this explains it.

950
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,650
How do I... Hold on.

951
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,220
It says...

952
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:22,100
Oh, thanks!

953
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:32,040
Zombie salmon refers to the last stages in a fish life cycle
after they have used almost all of their energy to spawn

954
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:39,980
depositing eggs in a gravel nest called a red salmon swim
around for some time while their bodies start to deteriorate

955
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:52,560
and rot it's so crazy salmon life is messed up it really is
it really is thank you so much for the read that work thank

956
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,140
you thank you

957
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:16,600
it says during this phase male salmon grow extra large teeth
to compete for mating also during this time a parasitic worm

958
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:29,860
called the philobrothium takes up residence in the salmon's
brain where it's able to gain control of them crazy luckily

959
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,220
that's not going to happen our fish.

960
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:32,920
Where's the glitch face?

961
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:33,420
Thank you!

962
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,380
Thank you, thank you, Darko, thank you!

963
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,720
No, well, thank you.

964
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,960
Thank you guys for all the gifts.

965
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,100
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

966
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,520
Guys, I'm not even playing the game.

967
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,440
I think we're the zombie.

968
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,340
I've been infected by worms.

969
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:48,940
No!

970
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,440
They have weird teeth just like you.

971
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,460
What's wrong with my teeth?

972
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,880
I don't think I have weird teeth.

973
01:05:58,940 --> 01:05:59,200
Right?

974
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:09,430
I don't think I have I don't think I have weird teeth.

975
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:11,250
Wait, what am I fishing like?

976
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:14,790
Oh, it's just kind of like it doesn't go in the water.

977
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:15,690
Oh, here we go.

978
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:17,950
Okay, I'm playing again now.

979
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:24,530
I like how the how the sun is starting to set and all.

980
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:25,410
It's really nice.

981
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,530
We need a closer look.

982
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,050
What are you, my dentist?

983
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,750
Wait, did he change my lure?

984
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,290
Yeah, he did.

985
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,250
Um, excuse me, Grandpa.

986
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:42,910
What are you doing?

987
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:48,490
Minky's a little gooby.

988
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:51,270
A gooby.

989
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:53,370
Dentist.

990
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,590
Open up real wide.

991
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,350
We're gonna look at your teeth.

992
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,990
Oh no, have you been flossing daily?

993
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:08,910
No, no!

994
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,600
Max, thank you so much for the hot dog.

995
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:15,830
Thank you.

996
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:23,110
Okay, ladies, welcome to bamboo ship.

997
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,130
Thank you!

998
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:32,250
Have you guys listened to Densu2 MVPs today?

999
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,270
Have you done your daily listen?

1000
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,840
Remember which guys?

1001
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:39,920
Do these guys...

1002
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,620
I don't think they do.

1003
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,080
These guys definitely don't.

1004
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,100
I think these guys do.

1005
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,220
Feast when I was a kid, but the location near me were all
catch and release.

1006
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:59,180
Stopped when I realized I was basically just hurting the
fish for a kernel of corn, which was the bait I used.

1007
01:07:59,520 --> 01:07:59,640
Oh!

1008
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,900
Yeah, that's kind of tough.

1009
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:11,160
At least, like, let you...

1010
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,000
Let you...

1011
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,940
Eat them.

1012
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,940
Eat what you catch.

1013
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,940
Unless maybe you get a zombie salmon.

1014
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,130
Someone wants to bite.

1015
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:30,530
No.

1016
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,410
Catch and release just sounds so sad.

1017
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:42,390
Let's go back over this way a little bit.

1018
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,610
Especially eat the zombie salmon.

1019
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:48,950
Okay.

1020
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:52,270
Zombie salmon to cause the zombie outbreak.

1021
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,480
I know, the stars are all...

1022
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,820
It's becoming so beautiful.

1023
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:02,820
All these guys, they're the bane of my existence.

1024
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,260
Ableclips, welcome back.

1025
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:06,820
Thank you!

1026
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,780
Thank you, thank you.

1027
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:09,980
Okay.

1028
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:12,540
Oh, oh, wait, this is good.

1029
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,780
I did the upgrades.

1030
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,840
I just realized the upgrades might help a lot.

1031
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:21,940
Maybe.

1032
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,100
Oh, he's still pulling.

1033
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,480
Oh, he's still pulling.

1034
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:29,540
Pink and green and blue and red.

1035
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,820
Please see a dentist.

1036
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,280
Yeah, you got that.

1037
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:35,760
What is it?

1038
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,820
The gum disease.

1039
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,720
And you're...

1040
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,340
You have...

1041
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:46,580
You have blood coming out when you floss.

1042
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,640
No good, no good.

1043
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:49,720
Oh my gosh.

1044
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,420
Brown tree.

1045
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,120
Wow, we're so tough.

1046
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:54,760
Gingeritis.

1047
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,580
Gummy bearitis.

1048
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:03,660
Oh, wait.

1049
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,920
What was the gummy bear song?

1050
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:06,700
Wasn't there a gummy bear song?

1051
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,860
You're a swim.

1052
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,280
No, that's not how it went.

1053
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,780
Have you tried actual fishing before?

1054
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:16,440
Yeah.

1055
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,420
Tried once and only caught a thumb-sized goldfish.

1056
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,420
I don't think I caught anything when I tried before.

1057
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:31,360
I think that would be a really fun Den Setsu trip though
where we go fishing together

1058
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:52,750
Woohoo I don't want that earworm in my head The gummy bear
song I don't remember how I went I'm a gummy bear I'm a

1059
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:57,290
gummy bear I'm a gummy gummy Gummy bear.

1060
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:59,390
I'm a gummy bear.

1061
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:01,370
I get in your hair.

1062
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:02,970
How did it go?

1063
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,230
You guys ever gotten gum in your hair?

1064
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:10,750
Oh, wait.

1065
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:11,350
That's the one?

1066
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,050
No, it's a different song.

1067
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:14,350
Wait, I don't know how it goes.

1068
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:17,250
We can buy it.

1069
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,800
You bring supper or just bragging rights?

1070
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,500
We can buy the bigger...

1071
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,040
A rod!

1072
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:32,480
Yeah, actually it sucks.

1073
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,980
Did you have to shave your head?

1074
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:49,450
I went fishing with my grandparents and my grandma couldn't
stop catching fish after fish.

1075
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:54,330
Turns out she was using fried chicken breading as bait and
the fish were really into that.

1076
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:55,990
Whoa.

1077
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:02,090
Yes, a maple scout, baby.

1078
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:07,880
Dang.

1079
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,400
Minky!

1080
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,320
That's me!

1081
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,400
Alright.

1082
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:18,500
Wait.

1083
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,180
Change rod.

1084
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,640
Little guppy no more.

1085
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,280
Now we're the maple scap.

1086
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:27,400
Alright.

1087
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,180
Wait.

1088
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:28,960
Let's keep going.

1089
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,940
This game is so pretty.

1090
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,900
How's the audio too?

1091
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,680
I feel like it might be a little low for you guys.

1092
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,960
All right, let's try here.

1093
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:44,640
This is it.

1094
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,760
This, wait, this is it.

1095
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,300
Oh, wait.

1096
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,960
Do they not like my lure, maybe?

1097
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:02,960
Oh, shoot.

1098
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,020
I just realized they might not like my lure.

1099
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:08,860
Oh.

1100
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:11,020
Yeah.

1101
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,300
Fishing hand can win.

1102
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,040
That would be fun.

1103
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,920
Just meow on the lake.

1104
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,140
I feel like I would need like an instructor though.

1105
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:31,800
I need fishing sensei.

1106
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,600
Come on!

1107
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,820
Give up.

1108
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,720
You are stubborn, but so am I.

1109
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:52,550
Growing up in the south, I sometimes got advice like if you
hear banjos, turn around.

1110
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:56,190
But they never mentioned what if the banjos were this
strong.

1111
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:56,570
Chill.

1112
01:13:59,150 --> 01:13:59,950
Were you...

1113
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:02,430
Wait, were you in like Appalachia?

1114
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:04,930
I've heard stories of that too.

1115
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,550
Wait, what do you mean if you hear banjos turn around?

1116
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:10,770
What?

1117
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,970
Onigiri has experience fishing.

1118
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:18,090
Yeah, I've seen her fish before.

1119
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:20,310
I saw that stream.

1120
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:25,590
Banjos means you're close to somebody's property.

1121
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:34,410
oh i've heard that it's like oh my gosh there's like so many
like people are like because you know like apalachia

1122
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:43,670
mountains are like so old like like it's a very old like
formation of the earth right and so you know that's why you

1123
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:52,070
get people being like there's bigfoot in these woods but
they'll also get people that are like the apalachia woods

1124
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:58,030
just have like a something Something extra in the woods.

1125
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:02,050
Bigfoot playing the banjo.

1126
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:04,170
Exactly.

1127
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:05,510
It could be.

1128
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:07,810
It very well could be.

1129
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:10,710
Bigfoot in your area.

1130
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,450
Bigfoot in your area.

1131
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:17,210
Wait, how does a black pink go?

1132
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:22,690
I did like, I used to do a workout routine.

1133
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:26,190
That was like, it was like a dancing workout.

1134
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:33,710
to Blackpink songs, but you, they did not teach the dance,
like the actual Blackpink dance.

1135
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:40,730
So I was like, well, what, what's the point?

1136
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:45,290
Blackpink is peak workout music, yeah.

1137
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,250
It was, it was fun.

1138
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:53,170
I did it for a while, and then I was like, but I want to
like actually learn the dance, you know what I mean?

1139
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:57,570
Actual dance is too hard.

1140
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:00,010
Nah.

1141
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:02,670
Let's move over a little bit.

1142
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,220
There were no guys that would pick up my thing.

1143
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:23,100
You guys, like, some of them, some of them are not
interested because they don't care about the size.

1144
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,060
Use a smaller rod if your target fish is spooked.

1145
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,540
Nah, he's just spooked because he saw...

1146
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:31,780
Oh, it's...

1147
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,060
See, see, this guy will eat it.

1148
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,760
He's the annoying one though.

1149
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:39,920
Come back down?

1150
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:40,880
Yeah.

1151
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,280
Come on.

1152
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:53,100
Yeah, come back my way.

1153
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,420
Yes.

1154
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,740
Yes, ah!

1155
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,820
Also good dating advice.

1156
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:09,400
What, to lure?

1157
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:20,740
what are you like peacocks are we doing like a mating dance
honestly though why didn't humans adopt that so many species

1158
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:39,060

did humans not think of that some humans do i will tell you

1159
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:51,640
though if you're trying to like impress somebody get really
into a hobby and by that i mean like people think it's like

1160
01:17:51,640 --> 01:18:02,520
some people not all but obviously but like some people think
it's like pretty attractive to like when you are really into

1161
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:09,660
something and like you're knowledgeable about it and stuff
like like a musical instrument it means you took the time to

1162
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,760
learn it You took the effort.

1163
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:12,820
You put in the effort.

1164
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,560
Yeah, people love a passionate people.

1165
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,060
Exactly.

1166
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,720
I don't remember if these guys bite.

1167
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,400
They bite.

1168
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:25,820
They bite.

1169
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:27,340
They bite.

1170
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,320
I don't think you care.

1171
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,300
They bite?

1172
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,540
Maybe he bites.

1173
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:36,860
Maybe he bites.

1174
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,360
They bite.

1175
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,520
bite?

1176
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,780
Literally turned around.

1177
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,320
What if your hobby is Minto?

1178
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,040
Show up on the first date, decked out Minto drip.

1179
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:51,600
Yeah, this is just my passion.

1180
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,120
Graphic design and VTubers are my passion.

1181
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:03,880
Focal missing in Appalachia could be because Bigfoot or
folks just getting lost or Bigfoot getting lost and playing

1182
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,440
the banjo to cheer himself up.

1183
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,160
Oh, he's lonely.

1184
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,520
Bigfoot must be lonely if there's only one bigfoot.

1185
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:17,400
And just like, uh...

1186
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:18,620
Um...

1187
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,500
Wow, 17!

1188
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:20,180
Nice.

1189
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:22,720
Like, oh, Nessie must be lonely.

1190
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,860
If there's one Nessie...

1191
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:25,720
I can't stay long.

1192
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:26,240
Gotta eat.

1193
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,080
Just got off work.

1194
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:27,640
Oh, too!

1195
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,680
I'm gonna say hi and hope you're all well.

1196
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,360
Just saw the post.

1197
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,520
I'm gonna reply with some games.

1198
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,160
You can ignore.

1199
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,300
Thank you, Fallen.

1200
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,260
Thank you, thank you!

1201
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:36,720
Alright, let's see.

1202
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,420
Let's, uh...

1203
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,400
Get...

1204
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,580
Oh, 50.

1205
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,700
Okay, we'll get the big crankbait.

1206
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,220
That will be our next goal.

1207
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,620
The cryptids got a hookup with other cryptids.

1208
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,860
Do you think like Chupacabra could hook up with Bigfoot and
then create a new species?

1209
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:08,960
We got the Jersey Devil and the Chupacabra together and they
created a new species of cryptid.

1210
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:10,400
Okay.

1211
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:10,420
I

1212
01:20:14,090 --> 01:20:15,930
think these guys bite.

1213
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,880
Use a smaller rod if you're fit.

1214
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:21,860
Are my fish spooked?

1215
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,220
Are you guys spooked?

1216
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,440
Are you spooked?

1217
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:30,020
Oh, they seem to be not going towards them.

1218
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:33,140
That'd be some twisted genetics.

1219
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:39,020
It's like when they make the tiger lions.

1220
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,420
The ligers.

1221
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,220
No, no, no.

1222
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,580
The Liger's.

1223
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:58,600
The Liger's.

1224
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:01,500
Liger's hero.

1225
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,320
I know I think of him every time, too.

1226
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,860
It's been so long since I've consumed Zoids media.

1227
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,660
And I'm like, why?

1228
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,620
Why am I depriving myself?

1229
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:19,980
Why?

1230
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,100
Zoids was so great.

1231
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,020
Oh my gosh.

1232
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:24,940
I watched a lot.

1233
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,060
I watched so much of Zoids as a kid.

1234
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,420
As a wee wish myself.

1235
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,460
I always think of Zoids as never the actual hiker.

1236
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,040
Just means you're cultured.

1237
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,000
You.

1238
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,220
You right there.

1239
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,000
Eat it.

1240
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:45,760
Eat mine.

1241
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,160
Oh, you?

1242
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,280
You're gonna eat it?

1243
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,480
Somebody eat it.

1244
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,260
Eat my lure.

1245
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,000
There was an RTS called Impossible Creatures.

1246
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:05,740
That lets you just mix and match animals and make a freak
army.

1247
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,460
That reminds me...

1248
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:09,880
There was, like, Pokemon things like that, too, right?

1249
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:15,560
Like, sites where you could, like, just kind of pair
different Pokemon together.

1250
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,180
And...

1251
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,620
Stop it!

1252
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:24,080
Stupid fish.

1253
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,780
We're losing him.

1254
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,160
Yeah, we lost him.

1255
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:28,580
Dang.

1256
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:31,920
The fusion site.

1257
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:32,420
Yeah!

1258
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,780
It was funny.

1259
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,780
It was pretty funny.

1260
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,860
They still have those Pokemon fusion things.

1261
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:42,500
I've been kind of itching for some more Pokemon recently.

1262
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:47,020
But I don't know which one I would play.

1263
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,860
Is he gonna eat it?

1264
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,500
Eat it!

1265
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,220
Just eat it!

1266
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:02,760
Oh, nice.

1267
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,540
Oh, okay.

1268
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,540
He's interested.

1269
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,500
He's doing a flashy dance.

1270
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:13,840
Pokemon Zah!

1271
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,300
Pokemon Zah!

1272
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,260
Maybe, uh...

1273
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,140
I don't know, though.

1274
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:27,100
I'm like, I think I'm just too old school.

1275
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,820
Maybe I would like it.

1276
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:34,020
But it's like the concept doesn't seem so interesting to me
at first.

1277
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:41,040
It's so funny because I'm so not, I'm so against like, uh,
what's the word?

1278
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:42,940
Stop it.

1279
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:43,340
So.

1280
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,360
Whoa.

1281
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:51,760
Nice.

1282
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,040
Um, turn-based.

1283
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,880
I usually don't like.

1284
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,500
turn-based except for Pokemon.

1285
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:11,150
I think it's kind of freaky that you can get hurt in this
new game, right?

1286
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:13,270
I'm just like, yeah.

1287
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:16,410
Sometimes the Pokemon go after you.

1288
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:18,890
Sometimes you are the victim.

1289
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:22,310
Have you tried Pow World?

1290
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:23,910
A little bit.

1291
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:25,790
I did play a little bit.

1292
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:32,290
Hmm.

1293
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:36,230
You can get hurt in Legends RCS 2.

1294
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:38,650
I think the last one I played...

1295
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:43,810
Oh my gosh, I cannot remember all these games anymore
because, one, I'm old.

1296
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:47,330
And two, they're like, every single game is just like a
letter.

1297
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:50,090
And I'm like, I can't remember what the...

1298
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:50,990
I've played...

1299
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:52,230
I played Q.

1300
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:53,930
I played W Pokemon.

1301
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:54,970
I played...

1302
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:57,490
I played F.

1303
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:58,590
Silent...

1304
01:24:58,590 --> 01:24:59,450
Pokemon F.

1305
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:04,850
is it time for a year-long Zoids games arc?

1306
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:12,630
Oh man I've never played a Zoids game Pokemon Rock and Paper
yeah on the DLC scissors

1307
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:21,710
go on ABC Pokemon Learn Your ABCs

1308
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:33,160
playing all the games with letters in alphabetical order

1309
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,360
Oh my gosh, where are the fishies that like my...

1310
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,300
I like what I got.

1311
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:49,360
You know what, actually I think we could probably sell these
and be able to buy the new...

1312
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,760
The new lure, I think so.

1313
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,240
Pokemon, go to the polls.

1314
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,460
Vote for Minto.

1315
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,080
I don't know what for.

1316
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,940
Just, just, just put me in.

1317
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:22,940
I just just just write me in put me in coach for president
my long rod is too imposing how can they tell that I have a

1318
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:32,500
long rod that shouldn't matter all right we're buying the
this guy

1319
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:43,140
okay let's go get some biggins I have

1320
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:51,090
long rod energy.

1321
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:55,930
People with long rods need love too.

1322
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,690
Don't be afraid, little fish.

1323
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:06,130
I am here to catch you and then sell you.

1324
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:09,350
Wait.

1325
01:27:09,970 --> 01:27:10,410
Yes.

1326
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:16,330
Ha ha!

1327
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:18,890
Ooh, a nice throw.

1328
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:22,370
All right, big fish.

1329
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,930
Big fish, I'm coming for you.

1330
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:33,930
Oh, that was so fast.

1331
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:36,710
Oh, he's strong.

1332
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:39,890
Okay.

1333
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:43,350
We might got this.

1334
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:45,030
We might have this.

1335
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:46,410
Oh.

1336
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:48,010
No.

1337
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:48,790
Oh no, stop, stop, stop.

1338
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:53,050
Oh no, oh no.

1339
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:54,250
I think we lost it.

1340
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:55,030
Oh, he's gone.

1341
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:55,830
He's gone rogue.

1342
01:27:56,010 --> 01:27:56,770
He's gone rogue.

1343
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,610
This is catch and release, right?

1344
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:10,730
What am I getting money for then?

1345
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:14,510
Yeah, I know.

1346
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:17,510
They make a break for it and it becomes impossible to like
keep going.

1347
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:19,930
Come on!

1348
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:25,490
No, please.

1349
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:27,870
please stop going crazy

1350
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:36,840
I don't think it's catching release no that's why I was
saying I don't think I would get paid if it were catching

1351
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:41,000
release oh my gosh he's also gone crazy oh please

way up to these big guys gotta tire him out he does seem to

1354
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:25,250
be resisting less it does seem to be and there's our fish
the brown trout large

1355
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:38,670
you guys ever get like the heavy sticker on your luggage and
just the heavy the heavy tag and just makes you feel like

1356

1358
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:24,410
the like the cord with the it's not the battery pack but um
that would always make it very heavy and then also

1359
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:35,400
my skin care power supply yes the power supply

1360
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:52,220
It's so ridiculously heavy, all the stuff that I...

1361
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:54,300
That I breathe.

1362
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,240
Please keep caring.

1363
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:06,920
Look, I gotta keep my ectoplasm nice and fresh, right?

1364
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,720
I like how he's fishing for me.

1365
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:11,280
You know what, I'll let him get these tough fish for me.

1366
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,740
Let's see if he can do it with ease.

1367
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,160
I'm blocking the entire thing.

1368
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:20,820
Come on, game.

1369
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,280
Oh my god, he got him so easily.

1370
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,140
Oh, nice, nice.

1371
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:34,060
Okay, we're just gonna let it, let the CPU play for a bit.

1372
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:39,200
This feels like that, what's it called?

1373
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,200
That AFK fishing game that...

1374
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,900
Okay, the game is actually playing for me.

1375
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:49,700
That's crazy.

1376
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:53,380
It's like stupid VTuber.

1377
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,480
Come on, we're catching the small fish now.

1378
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:01,740
It's like the games that you can play.

1379
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,320
It's really a Twitch game.

1380
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:08,400
If you've ever seen somebody that is AFK on Twitch,
sometimes they'll have a fish thing.

1381
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:15,460
I think that's part of the reason Twitch kind of drives me
crazy.

1382
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:24,420
is because I feel like and I don't know obviously it's not
going to be for everybody but I feel like with a lot of

1383
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:34,160
YouTube streams the culture here is more like I'm having a
conversation with you guys right like I'm I am reading your

1384
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:44,700
comments I am I am you know we're talking together you know
but on Twitch it's like so much like I'll see like some

1385
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:55,200
streamers streaming and like they have that like fish thing
on and the whole chat is just is just people doing like

1386
01:32:55,200 --> 01:33:03,440
exclamation point fish exclamation point fish and the
streamer is kind of like i'm like why are you streaming like

1387
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:11,000
just make youtube videos if you don't care about reading
your chat i don't understand it yeah exclamation point fish

1388
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,880
exclamation point fish

1389
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:19,040
And so I think that's just what I can't get behind.

1390
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:20,640
I'm just so like, wait, wait, wait.

1391
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,460
I want to go get our upgrades real quick.

1392
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,320
Stop, stop, stop.

Exclamation point, Minto.

1394
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:37,210

all.

01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:22,690
Clearly.

1406
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:27,090
But the dog...

1407
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:27,450
Oh!

1408
01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:30,450
Pat your companion ten times in one session.

1409
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:34,750
Alright, hold on.

1410
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:37,370
Let's switch out for the big guy.

1411
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:40,550
And for uh...

1412
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:42,330
this guy.

1413
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:44,790
Big guy.

1414
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:45,150
Alright.

1415
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:45,730
Well, no.

1416
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:46,370
Big guy.

1417
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:53,870
Also good dating advice.

1418
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:56,630
What's good dating advice?

1419
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:01,450
I think you're making that up.

1420
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:06,610
Big guy, big pants.

1421
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:08,410
SpongeBob, big pants.

1422
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:11,070
SpongeBob, big guy.

1423
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:12,550
What do you care about?

1424
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:13,610
Oh, never mind.

1425
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:14,550
You care about me.

1426
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:17,990
You care about me.

1427
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:21,730
No, don't go rogue.

1428
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:22,250
Rogue.

1429
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:23,030
Come on.

1430
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:24,170
No, no, don't do it.

1431
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:24,990
Yeah, that's right.

1432
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:27,310
You kind of gotta yank them back a little bit.

1433
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:29,690
You gotta show them who's bouse.

1434
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:33,010
You gotta show them who's bouse.

1435
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:33,390
No.

1436
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:38,510
I care about Minto.

1437
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:39,650
Yeah, how you do?

1438
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,140
No, we're about to lose a...

1439
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:46,700
Ugh!

1440
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,100
I'm a very interactive streamer.

1441
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:55,120
Is that not the norm?

1442
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:14,520
is that an ordinary hey you're gonna have to get better
you're missing okay round two stop it oh we lost him again

1443
01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:24,380
you are much more than others I think a lot of streamers
kind of resent their chats I wouldn't say that I don't want

1444
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:27,640
to say I don't want to put that kind of, you know...

1445
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:28,840
You said that, not me.

1446
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,760
Can you rate my current skincare routine?

1447
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,480
Currently do Cetaphil Cleanser.

1448
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,000
Good, good.

1449
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,380
Thayer's Toner.

1450
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,200
Anua Serum.

1451
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:38,980
Kauzer X.

1452
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:40,540
All-in-One Snail Cream.

1453
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,280
Beauty of Josan Moisturizer.

1454
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:44,880
Wow.

1455
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:49,120
I don't know the toner brand, actually, but...

1456
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:51,640
You are exceptional, not the norm.

1457
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:52,060
What?

1458
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,100
I think, though, that's also partial.

1459
01:36:55,120 --> 01:37:01,680
why I get so distracted in games though because I'm I'm
reading you guys too much it's your fault I'm bad at games

1460
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:22,340
it's a your fault your skincare routine sounds great trophy
weight catch let's go whoa that's a big in holy cow holy cow

1461
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:25,700
we are okay with it yeah you're okay with me but I'm bad?

1462
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,040
How bad can I be?

1463
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,560
VTuber, how did you?

1464
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:32,420
She was... Wait, wait, hold on.

1465
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,320
Let me be... Be... Hold on.

1466
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:35,540
We're making a song right now.

1467
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:37,900
How bad can I be?

1468
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:45,720
I would have hit him if it were me.

1469
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:48,140
How bad can I be?

1470
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:50,440
How bad can I possibly be?

1471
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:53,020
The VTuber's playing.

1472
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:55,660
But she's not even slaying.

1473
01:37:56,780 --> 01:38:01,800
She's just yapping while the fish are...

1474
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,400
What is this guy doing?

1475
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,320
I just got back.

1476
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:08,980
What's happening?

1477
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:11,880
Uh, autobiography?

1478
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,280
The fishler.

1479
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,980
Yeah, napping.

1480
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:21,500
That's a good one.

1481
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:21,940
That's a good one.

1482
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,860
She might as well be napping.

1483
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:32,500
And the games are losing.

1484
01:38:37,690 --> 01:38:39,690
She's not even cruising.

1485
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:47,090
They all started grooving.

1486
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:53,390
Twitch viewers are Tendere with their Oshi.

1487
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:55,210
They bully them but love them.

1488
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:55,530
I don't know.

1489
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:57,570
I feel like I get bullied too sometimes.

1490
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,390
I think I get bullied too.

1491
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:08,010
I scrub my face with a washcloth in the shower in the
morning and wipe it with a wet paper towel before bed.

1492
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:13,670
The reals learn.

1493
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:17,470
Yeah.

1494
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:20,770
Wet paper towel.

1495
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:23,670
For some reason I didn't imagine a wet paper towel.

1496
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:31,290
I imagine like, you know how sometimes people describe like
a pathetic animal being like it looks like a wet towel.

1497
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:35,050
Like a wet animal, like a wet cat or something.

1498
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:35,950
That's what I am.

1499
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:40,270
I'm just picking up the whole wet cat and like motorboating
it.

1500
01:39:40,490 --> 01:39:40,810
Like, bb.

1501
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:45,110
You know what?

1502
01:39:45,170 --> 01:39:45,330
Okay.

1503
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:49,550
Everybody who is a pet owner can agree with me on this.

1504
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:58,490
One of the worst things with an animal, with your pet, with
your pet, is going to pet your pet.

1505
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:00,510
And they're wet.

1506
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:10,670
that rhyme but you know what i mean you go to pet your pet
and you're like why are you mysteriously wet and what is the

1507
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:23,490
substance it's so scary it's actually it's actually
terrifying because you're just like what is this what is it

1508
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:32,850
is this guy gonna eat come on come on i'm so attractive i'm
doing a little twisty dance You were in.

1509
01:40:33,010 --> 01:40:33,470
You're in.

1510
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:34,450
Oh, yeah.

1511
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:35,110
Oh, yeah.

1512
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:36,350
Oh, yeah.

1513
01:40:36,490 --> 01:40:36,710
Oh, yeah.

1514
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:39,950
Then he got to do a smell check.

1515
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:42,930
I don't want to put my nose near.

1516
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:48,210
What was it in your case?

1517
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:51,810
The last time this happened to me, my cat...

1518
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:54,410
So sometimes he...

1519
01:40:54,410 --> 01:41:00,390
Sometimes he puts his cheek too far into the running water
dish that he has.

1520
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:06,850
And then, like, when he lays, he lays his head down on
himself.

1521
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:10,830
And so, he will,

1522
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:14,250
yeah.

1523
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:16,530
So, sometimes it's usually that.

1524
01:41:16,650 --> 01:41:21,270
Or, there's been times, like, depending on what kind of, I
had a different water dish for him.

1525
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:24,030
And he would just, like, stick his, you know, some cats do
that.

1526
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:25,950
They just stick their heads inside of it.

1527
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:26,910
And he would do that.

1528
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:29,410
Oh, oh, no.

1529
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:30,970
Try a different lure.

1530
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:31,990
If the fish aren't interested.

1531
01:41:32,010 --> 01:41:42,570
why is nobody interested in me I'm doing an attractive dance
please hope you had a great day enjoy this game thank you

Actually, he's just saying that because he's just like,

Hulled a beast like it was nothing.

1554
01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:06,390
Rules are simple.

1555
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:09,130
Any rod, any lure, no treats.

1556
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:14,450
You land a Wally heavier than Evie Jeans, and that trophy is
yours.

1557
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:16,730
Along with a year's worth of bragging rights.

01:44:28,030 --> 01:44:29,030
Little tip for you.

1563
01:44:29,310 --> 01:44:37,910
no point trying to wrangle a beast like that with poor gear
okay we need this this is for the wally the heavy spoon bait

Yeah, but...

1567
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:05,730
I like saying walley is fun.

1568
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:11,880
Walley.

1569
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:12,320

Come on, come on.

1575
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,780
Come on.

1576
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,060
Come on!

1577
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,500
This guy's feisty.

1578
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,020
I'll give him that.

1579
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:02,850
Yes.

1580
01:46:05,550 --> 01:46:07,070
I was scared for a second.

1581
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:08,150
I thought we lost it for a second.

1582
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:12,070
I wish I could reel faster, you know.

1583
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:15,330
He's tired now though, he's tired.

1584
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:17,490
Or maybe not.

1585
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:18,570
Oh my gosh.

1586
01:46:19,430 --> 01:46:20,010
Oh my gosh.

1587
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:22,110
Yeah, he's tired, he's tired, he's tired.

1588
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:23,950
Come on!

1589
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:26,650
Yeah?

1590
01:46:28,730 --> 01:46:29,370
Yeah?

1591
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:31,150
Yeah!

1592
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:32,870
Brown trout!

1593
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,160
Suspenseful.

1594
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,260
It truly is.

1595
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:43,740
So the Wally...

1596
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:48,870
It's only when we haven't caught.

1597
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:55,440
Extra large.

1598
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,300
Spoon bait.

1599
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:59,300
Wait, oh, I didn't change it, did I?

1600
01:46:59,420 --> 01:47:00,360
Now I think about it.

1601
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,380
There we go, the heavy spoon bait.

1602
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:08,680
I'm here for some whims to catch Wally.

1603
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,860
But they're a little more green.

1604
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:25,000
Right here.

1605
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,080
Is it these guys here?

1606
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:40,060
Oh, someone's interested.

1607
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,380
Am I attracting you?

1608
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:49,540
Yeah.

1609
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:50,960
No.

1610
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:07,540
Walleye is one of my favorite southeast Michiganders have
specialized techniques to catch them What could that be What

01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:56,800
He was too huge!

1625
01:48:58,260 --> 01:48:59,680
I didn't say the change!

1626
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,820
That's our 20-pounder.

1627
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:04,120
No!

1628
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:04,480

There we go, here we go.

Yeah, he's a real unit.

1637
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:25,510
He's scary.

1638
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:28,310
We are... I know we are not ready for him.

1639
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:34,530
That's like going to the Elite Four when we've just beat
Misty.

1640
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:38,590
We're not ready.

01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:24,450
Get him when he's out.

1649
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:26,310
Yeah, when he can't breathe.

1650
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:26,930
Woo!

1652
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:32,530
Hey, this is an eight pounder.

1653
01:50:32,970 --> 01:50:34,210
Eight pounder Wally.

1654
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:40,220
Fake it till you make it is my policy.

1655
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,680
It's a good policy, honestly.

1656
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:43,860
Okay.

1657
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:45,100
Don't turn around.

1658
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:46,560
I'm not interested in you.

1659
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:47,720
I'm interested in this.

1660
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:48,660
this bad boy.

1661
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:49,400
Oh, yeah.

1662
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,440
An eight-pound fish is... I know, he does weigh more than
me.

1663
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:04,780
I weigh zero pounds!

1664
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:07,220
That's crazy.

1665
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:09,660
Actually, all of these fish weigh more than me.

1666
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:13,260
It's funny.

1667
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:17,280
I think people thought I was taller than what I really am.

1668
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:20,000
Because I posted my reference sheet recently.

1669
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,120
And I got several comments from people being like, I thought
you were...

1670
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:35,860
so tall and I was like where did this information who
thought this come on oh my gosh we almost had him oh come on

1671
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:43,930
come on oh my gosh we're so close come on come on yes

1672
01:51:55,960 --> 01:52:02,160
yeah everyone is always talking about you being tiny I don't
know but some people I guess like maybe if you don't I mean

1673
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:09,060
not everyone's gonna catch every part of a or anything like
that so if you don't hear that i don't know maybe i give off

1674
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:15,800
really big tall energy now we have the vision of you getting
pulled through the air while trying to fish

1675
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:31,360
i give big big energy before this though um we're just gonna
catch a small fish so that we can

1676
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,280
yeah we'll do this one

1677
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:49,220
I regret to inform you, you do not have big, tall energy.

1678
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,540
Don't say, no, that's not true at all.

1679
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:54,320
Because then why else would people think that I'm massive?

1680
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:57,200
I'm huge in Japan.

1681
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:01,700
How did this guy live?

1682
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,620
I had literally had him.

1683
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,380
I miss those shirts.

1684
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:20,540
It's the hot.

1685
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:21,770
Truly, it must be.

1686
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:33,220
Huge money!

1687
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,220
Huge money!

1688
01:53:34,420 --> 01:53:34,980
Let's go!

1689
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:35,780
Wait, what is this?

1690
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:39,720
Now that's what I call a comeback.

1691
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:42,020
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1692
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:45,020
Wait, what are you trying to get me to buy?

1693
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:52,180
There's something on an exclamation point.

1694
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:53,120
Is it this?

1695
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:02,170
Minto is not tall, but her heart is huge.

1696
01:54:03,850 --> 01:54:04,670
I'm the Grinch.

1697
01:54:05,150 --> 01:54:05,810
I'm the Grinch.

1698
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:06,770
I'm the Grinch.

1699
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:08,870
The timber jack rod.

1700
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:12,690
Oh, oh, it just wants me to click on it.

1701
01:54:12,730 --> 01:54:14,010
Oh, okay, because I can't buy it.

1702
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:14,910
I couldn't buy it before.

1703
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:15,290
Okay.

1704
01:54:15,310 --> 01:54:15,590
Okay.

1705
01:54:20,450 --> 01:54:23,910
Oh, I think I'm going to be able to buy that big boy now.

1706
01:54:24,110 --> 01:54:24,650
Not buy him.

1707
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:24,950
Sorry.

1708
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:26,030
I could pay him off, maybe.

1709
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:27,390
Oh, you want me to tip?

1710
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:31,390
You're a real gem.

1711
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:31,970
You know that?

1712
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:33,150
I think he likes me.

1713
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:35,410
But I'll be.

1714
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:37,330
A fish from every hole in the fork.

1715
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:38,690
Not too shabby, bud.

1716
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,550
Looks like your rod's still twitching.

1717
01:54:42,010 --> 01:54:42,870
And wouldn't you know it?

1718
01:54:43,110 --> 01:54:45,290
There's a sweet little spot-up river at Beaver.

1719

1723
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:40,750
Banjo and the moonlight.

1724
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:41,850
It's too beautiful.

1725
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:44,570
It's too beautiful.

1726
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:45,470
Oh, new species.

1727
01:55:46,190 --> 01:55:46,810
Oh, yeah.

1728
01:55:48,010 --> 01:55:49,170
I guess the shiny ones?

1729
01:55:49,330 --> 01:55:50,490
Okay, I'm understanding now.

1730
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:55,570
The shiny ones are ones that I have not caught yet because
only the Wally was shiny before.

1731
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:58,930
I know you want me.

1732
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:00,210
I know you want me.

1733
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:03,050
You wanted me.

1734
01:56:03,710 --> 01:56:05,070
Why don't you want me anymore?

1735
01:56:05,210 --> 01:56:05,890
Oh, you do.

1736
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:06,750
Oh, no, you're teaching.

me.

1738
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:08,470
No,

1739
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:12,820
they are interested.

1740
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:13,680
Shut up, game.

1741
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:15,460
They are interested.

1742
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:22,300
See?

1743
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:24,900
Ooh, watch me dance.

1744
01:56:25,660 --> 01:56:28,040
You can dance.

1745
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:30,240
You can drive.

1746
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,600
Having the time of your afterlife.

1747
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:35,540
Ooh.

1748
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:46,320
This is sad.

1749
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,100
Crank bait.

1750
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:57,360
Yeah.

1751
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:05,680
Fishing queen.

1752
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:11,740
Young and sweet lures.

1753
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:14,780
17 inches.

1754
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,120
Actually not very big is it.

1755
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:20,120
Oh wait.

1756
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:20,900
Like you know what?

1757
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,940
Why am I going through this effort?

1758
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:23,320
Okay.

1759
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:24,100
Crank bait.

1760
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,260
Jig head.

1761
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:28,560
Do I have that?

1762
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,060
Wait, what did I do?

1763
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:40,360
Sorry, not the lure, the lion.

1764
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:44,920
I don't have!

1765
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:47,400
I don't have it!

1766
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:50,520
I only have a crankbait.

1767
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:52,460
Wait, someone else like something else, though.

1768
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:53,160
What did you like?

1769
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,300
Oh, you like the crankbait.

1770
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,600
Oh, because you're the brown trout.

1771
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,700
Just, you're brown trout, just upstream.

1772
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:03,820
Is that a small dog in an anime?

1773
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:06,500
movie that picks fights with all the bigger dogs.

1774
01:58:07,900 --> 01:58:08,060
What?

1775
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:08,680
Ooh!

1776
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:09,760
Wait, snooze.

1777
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:10,720
I can go to sleep?

1778
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:12,440
Oh my gosh.

1779
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:13,560
I could actually...

1780
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:15,680
I can actually rest.

1781
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:18,500
Wait, sorry.

1782
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:19,560
Was it crankbait?

1783
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:20,440
Yes.

1784
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:22,400
Just making sure.

1785
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:31,900
I'm not picking fights.

1786
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:36,760
I'm not picking fights.

1787
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:40,720
Crankbait.

1788
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:42,020
Yeah.

1789
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:52,920
New species- oh these guys are teeny tiny.

1790
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,580
Little babies.

1791
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:00,540
There's no...

1792
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:01,780
Okay, what do you guys like?

1793
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:03,340
Oh, what do you went to?

1794
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:05,860
A drop shot!

1795
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:12,280
How do you think they got the name The Long Nose Sucker?

1796
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:15,620
Wait.

1797
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:20,200
We got one!

1798
01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:24,530
The long nose sucker!

1799
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:29,230
Come here, you little sucker.

1800
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:31,590
We got him!

1801
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:40,780
Bottom feeders with the... They don't look...

1802
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:43,860
At least the image of them does not look very long.

1803
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:45,860
They look quite average, actually.

1804
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:47,660
Wait, these ones are kind of bigger, though.

1805
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:49,240
We'll focus on these guys.

1806
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:51,940
They do look like bottom feeders, though.

1807
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:53,200
They're all hanging out downstairs.

1808
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:10,340
you ever think about how like lobster and stuff used to be
like really people thought it was really disgusting and then

1809
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:20,340
the marketing for it changed and then it was just like oh
lobster it's a delicacy oh i thought minta was the cute

1810
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:23,500
ghost of it on my tv that's me that's me

1811
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:28,340
I said that in a chat this week.

1812
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:29,020
Oh, really?

1813
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,740
That's crazy.

1814
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:32,280
Oysters, too?

1815
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:34,280
I can't get behind oysters.

1816
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:36,340
Actually, this is the worst part.

1817
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,960
I say I don't like oysters, but I've never tried one.

1818
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:43,080
I just know I won't like the texture.

1819
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:46,840
I just know I won't like it.

1820
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:51,280
Okay, these guys ain't buying.

1821
02:00:53,780 --> 02:00:55,040
You don't blame me?

1822
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:55,880
Yeah.

1823
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:59,500
You don't chew, you just swallow it.

1824
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:00,820
I know that scares me.

1825
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:03,820
I'm a literal dog.

1826
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:09,200
You give me something and I keep it in my mouth and you're
like, spit, spit.

1827
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:14,900
And I'm like, instead you'd be like, you'd be like, you have
to swallow it.

1828
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:17,920
And I'd be like, you know,

1829
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:25,680
you'd be like, you have to, it's in one go, but I'd be like,
no.

1830
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:29,560
Drop it, drop it.

1831
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:35,160
We could solve a giant ecological issue that affects the
whole U.S.

1832
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:36,020
if we ate carp.

1833
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:40,360
But people who never ate carp in their life goes, Poor
person, fish.

1834
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,020
Well, what if it just tastes bad?

1835
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:48,240
I think they just gotta rename it.

1836
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:48,820
You know what I mean?

1837
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:51,460
Sometimes renaming something.

1838
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:53,420
Like, carp sounds stupid.

1839
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:54,140
Sorry.

1840
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:54,920
Sorry to carp.

1841
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:02,900
It tastes pretty good?

1842
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:03,480
Yeah.

1843
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:13,400
What are we spitting and or swallowing?

1844
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:14,280
Oyster?

1845
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:15,020
Oyster?

1846
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:19,040
It's kind of bony.

1847
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:20,760
Yeah.

1848
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:27,620
Let's go for the big...

1849
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:36,160
Let's try.

1850
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:44,660
I could eat like 500 raw oysters at any given moment.

1851
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:45,740
That's crazy.

1852
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:48,380
I've also heard of like...

1853
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:52,380
There's like some sort of...

1854
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:57,380
Some sort of sickness you can get from the oyster, so...

1855
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:03,080
I'm having a hard time out here, folks.

1856
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:05,720
I think we gotta go back to our previous location.

1857
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:07,140
And...

1858
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:07,560
Oh, what?

1859
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:08,180
Whoa.

1860
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:10,600
Don't do that to me.

1861
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:11,760
I saw you were interested.

1862
02:03:13,180 --> 02:03:14,220
Just chatting?

1863
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:15,660
Nah, just casting.

1864
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:18,380
Is he a long nose sucker?

1865
02:03:18,700 --> 02:03:20,920
Because he's a sucker with a long nose?

1866
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,220
Or because he's suckers on long noses?

1867
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:25,820
That's what I thought, too.

1868
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:29,600
I was like, maybe he's like...

1869
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,500
On people's noses.

1870
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:32,900
Maybe.

1871
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:36,400
Maybe what had happened was...

1872
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:41,680
He, like, someone caught it, and it, like, went, like, a
cartoon moment.

1873
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:49,160
It got flipped in the air, and then he got stuck on the
guy's nose and started to just, and that's how he got the

1874
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:49,480
name.

1875
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,720
That's honestly what I was thinking.

1876
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:57,620
Yeah, I think we need to save for new lures.

1877
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,040
Yeah, I was, yeah.

1878
02:04:01,060 --> 02:04:02,160
True and factual.

1879
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:03,840
I was there, I was there.

1880
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:07,660
I was there.

1881
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:09,640
I saw it all happen.

1882
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:10,540
That guy?

1883
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:11,180
Me.

1884
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:16,740
Remember I told you about that one time I went fishing?

1885
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:18,660
Crazy.

1886
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:20,680
Crazy stuff happened.

1887
02:04:27,180 --> 02:04:28,880
There was a hold.

1888
02:04:29,460 --> 02:04:31,220
I was on the news and everything.

1889
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:36,280
I mean, it was my local news, but...

1890
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:37,860
You guys asked for a story.

1891
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,860
Wait, did I change my thing?

1892
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:40,500
No.

1893
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:45,010
Hold on.

1894
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:46,670
Everybody clapped.

1895
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:49,030
It's awesome.

1896
02:04:50,230 --> 02:04:50,750
It's true.

1897
02:04:50,830 --> 02:04:51,610
I was the fish.

1898
02:04:53,010 --> 02:04:53,990
Oh my gosh.

1899
02:04:54,070 --> 02:04:55,750
It's been so long.

1900
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:57,370
It's been so long.

1901
02:04:57,450 --> 02:04:58,810
No, no, no, no.

1902
02:04:59,730 --> 02:05:00,250
No.

1903
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:02,370
No.

1904
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:05,170
He is too scary.

1905
02:05:07,810 --> 02:05:08,690
Don't look at my...

1906
02:05:09,230 --> 02:05:10,670
Don't look at my lure again.

1907
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:15,210
Oh!

1908
02:05:17,450 --> 02:05:18,470
Oh, he's flying!

1909
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:22,530
Come on.

1910
02:05:23,690 --> 02:05:24,410
No, no.

1911
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:26,170
Oh no, he's going rogue.

1912
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:27,350
Come on.

1913
02:05:27,670 --> 02:05:29,610
Final boss of the lake, guys.

1914
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:30,490
Seriously.

1915
02:05:31,330 --> 02:05:33,910
Everybody is literally cowering over this guy.

1916
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:38,510
I mean, I don't know how territorial fish can be, I'm sure.

1917
02:05:39,230 --> 02:05:48,810
probably some of these things depend on the type of fish but
but can you imagine everybody's eating chowing down and then

1918
02:05:48,810 --> 02:06:02,190
this guy comes up and they're like big way the big Wally big
Wally's here he's like I'm big Wally fish can get crazy

1919
02:06:02,190 --> 02:06:09,890
territorial group are I mean oh you know I have heard that
about like a beta fish right like Like you shouldn't have

1920
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:11,770
more than one beta fish in a tank.

1921
02:06:14,650 --> 02:06:15,350
I was definitely...

1922
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:16,770
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1923
02:06:16,970 --> 02:06:17,710
Not for you.

1924
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:18,290
Not for you.

1925
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:19,330
Don't be greedy.

1926
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:20,530
No, no, no.

1927
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:26,470
I like that it immediately just disconnects.

1928
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:29,950
I fell victim to getting a beta fish.

1929
02:06:31,370 --> 02:06:35,230
And loving my beta fish so much that I was like...

1930
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:37,330
I...

1931
02:06:39,230 --> 02:06:51,310
beta fish to be so happy and so full and I fell victim to
pouring the whole bag of food that I received into his into

1932
02:06:51,310 --> 02:07:08,810
his quaint tank he lived he lived for a while even she
exploded him no no I didn't

1933
02:07:12,530 --> 02:07:14,470
He was just...

1934
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:16,070
Can fish get fat?

1935
02:07:17,710 --> 02:07:18,310
Like, do fish...

1936
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:20,030
Like...

1937
02:07:20,030 --> 02:07:22,350
You kind of like, you know how you shouldn't feed birds.

1938
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:23,990
Uh...

1939
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:25,410
Like rice and stuff.

1940
02:07:26,650 --> 02:07:26,990
Right?

1941
02:07:27,150 --> 02:07:29,030
Like, that will make their tummies explode.

1942
02:07:30,070 --> 02:07:31,370
Is there... Stop!

1943
02:07:31,870 --> 02:07:34,130
Is there something similar to...

1944
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:35,490
To fish?

1945
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:40,190
Fish can keep growing.

1946
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:41,370
Oh, I have heard that!

1947
02:07:41,590 --> 02:07:50,610
Like, a gold fish that's been released to the wild and they
they they usually they grow to the size of their tank but oh

1948
02:07:50,610 --> 02:07:56,050
man release a goldfish and they'll grow to the size of the
pond

1949
02:08:00,770 --> 02:08:02,970
fat fish make the tastiest fish

1950
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:17,890
stop why would you even grab it if you're just gonna be like
that not a team player wait are you interested No?

1951
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:21,620
Oh!

1952
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:26,100
We've lost before we could even start.

1953
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:27,600
Stop!

1954
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:28,200
Go away.

1955
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:33,620
My five-year-old nephew may have recently made that food
mistake with his brother's beta.

1956
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:38,180
Sadly, the fish was never the same after.

1957
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:38,820
Oh, geez.

1958
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:43,560
Magic carp was a cautionary tale.

1959
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:49,860
This guy is rogue.

1960
02:08:49,860 --> 02:08:51,120
It's insane.

1961
02:08:52,920 --> 02:09:00,180
I am clearing out the population of wallies in this river,
though.

1962
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,540
Oh, the tension, the tension.

1963
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:12,700
Not just the tension, the suspense, but also the tension of
my line.

1964
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:21,160
No, no, no, don't do it.

1965
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:23,220
Don't do it.

1966
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,260
Oh my god, he's so strong.

1967
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:29,740
Ugh.

1968
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:32,580
Ugh.

1969
02:09:32,780 --> 02:09:36,380
Fine, we'll go with the stinking brown trout.

1970
02:09:46,940 --> 02:09:48,760
We'll go with the brown trout.

1971
02:09:50,940 --> 02:09:53,020
I think I need to move more over, actually.

1972
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:07,000
I like that you can play it either, like, play, play this
game, or you can just idle it and, like, let it go forever.

1973
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:07,360
room.

1974
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:11,340
Imagine how much, like, cash money I can make.

1975
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:14,580
I, like, go for a walk for an hour and come back.

1976
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:21,680
Aren't you a brown trout?

1977
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:23,960
Yes.

1978
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:32,480
Passive income.

1979
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:34,720
Yeah.

1980
02:10:37,870 --> 02:10:49,470
If I got real serious about this game, which I fear I might,
just let grandpa do the fishing he's a pro i feel like i'm

1981
02:10:49,470 --> 02:10:55,590
actually like like the grand kid in the boat that he's
allowing to do the fishing and then if i let him take over

1982
02:10:55,590 --> 02:11:06,050
he's just like let me show you how a real fisherman does it
you know i'm the dog

1983
02:11:09,190 --> 02:11:10,030
Big dog.

1984
02:11:10,910 --> 02:11:11,730
Wait, little dog.

1985
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:11,970
Ow!

1986
02:11:12,190 --> 02:11:12,290
Ow!

1987
02:11:12,630 --> 02:11:13,150
Big dog.

1988
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:14,090
Woof, woof.

1989
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:21,700
Chad paw.

1990
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:22,420
No.

1991
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:27,380
There's like a DLC or something for this game that you can
get a cat.

1992
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,700
Honestly, I should have bought it.

1993
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:33,560
Where'd my fish go?

1994
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:34,040
Oh, there he is.

1995
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:39,700
Even with the upgrades, though, These guys are tricky.

1996
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:44,980
Do you think you give off big dog or little dog energy?

1997
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:47,900
I think I am the big dog.

1998
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:49,800
I am the big dog.

1999
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:52,380
Kind of miss that game.

2000
02:11:52,540 --> 02:11:53,040
Lifeline.

2001
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:54,420
Me too.

2002
02:11:58,600 --> 02:11:59,900
I kind of do too.

2003
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:04,040
There's like certain series that I'll like just keep
quoting, you know?

2004
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:08,680
That's how you know that it is so memorable to me.

2005
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:17,960
You know, if I can't stop quoting a game, it was just that,
like, that much of an experience for me.

2006
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:20,280
Lifeline.

2007
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:23,320
Nice!

2008
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:28,740
Lifeline was just such a...

2009
02:12:28,740 --> 02:12:29,420
Yeah.

2010
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:35,540
Some lines really do stick in your head forever.

2011
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,100
Yeah, they really do.

2012
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:39,260
Oh, wait.

2013
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:40,800
I don't think there's any more.

2014
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:43,500
What are these tiny guys?

2015
02:12:45,580 --> 02:12:47,620
Are they not small brown trout?

2016
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:50,080
Wait, they're shiny.

2017
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:51,920
Wait, so are these guys.

2018
02:12:57,900 --> 02:12:58,380
Curious.

2019
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:01,520
Curious.

2020
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:06,240
Up there with your outer wild streams.

2021
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:09,560
Think about outer wilds is there's nothing too close.

2022
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:13,680
From the...

2023
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:15,360
Game itself, right?

2024
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:20,100
I mean, there's just so little dialogue in it.

2025
02:13:23,690 --> 02:13:25,370
Yeah, like Roadrunner cartoons.

2026
02:13:27,330 --> 02:13:28,450
Roadrunner cartoons.

2027
02:13:29,210 --> 02:13:30,330
Roadrunner cartoons.

2028
02:13:32,670 --> 02:13:33,750
Just the banjo.

2029
02:13:33,870 --> 02:13:35,970
Okay, the music from Outer Wows, yeah.

2030
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:39,150
I just sometimes will just kind of like be sitting there and
I'll be like,

2031
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:57,920
I do think the...

2032
02:13:59,290 --> 02:14:00,230
It's so emoy.

2033
02:14:00,530 --> 02:14:01,790
So emoy!

2034
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:10,950
Oh my gosh!

2035
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:11,590
Crazy!

2036
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:12,110
This guy!

2037
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:15,190
It is a brown trout!

2038
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:17,110
Good dude.

2039
02:14:17,710 --> 02:14:18,050
Good boy.

2040
02:14:18,670 --> 02:14:19,050
Good boy.

2041
02:14:19,770 --> 02:14:20,130
Okay.

2042
02:14:21,950 --> 02:14:23,330
Yeah, I know it's a return.

2043
02:14:25,730 --> 02:14:26,490
Uh-oh.

2044
02:14:28,030 --> 02:14:28,610
No.

2045
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:31,250
Cops of marshmallow on a stick.

2046
02:14:33,130 --> 02:14:36,110
I always quote, I tried everything I could think of and
neither one worked.

2047
02:14:37,090 --> 02:14:37,930
What is that from?

2048
02:14:38,530 --> 02:14:40,570
Is that from a...

2049
02:14:40,570 --> 02:14:44,050
The love letters on brittle hollow are pretty quotable if
depressing.

2050
02:14:45,550 --> 02:14:51,490
Yeah, you could quote like the Carthians and stuff.

2051
02:14:52,210 --> 02:14:53,190
It's a gabrolone.

2052
02:14:55,010 --> 02:14:55,590
54!

2053
02:14:56,390 --> 02:14:56,750
Whoa!

2054
02:14:58,570 --> 02:14:59,610
Wait, so...

2055
02:15:00,290 --> 02:15:03,830
Well, I'll be back in the land of leeches and lunkers, are
you?

2056
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:09,870
Don't just stand there like a stone perch, grab a coffee and
tell me what trouble you've been into.

2057
02:15:12,610 --> 02:15:13,230
Oh, here we go.

2058
02:15:13,710 --> 02:15:17,530
The jig head, the jig is up head, and the drop shot.

2059
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:20,950
I feel though...

2060
02:15:23,990 --> 02:15:25,030
I feel...

2061
02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:25,450
Wait.

2062
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:30,230
Can I...

2063
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:33,390
Can I put this on any rod?

2064
02:15:33,570 --> 02:15:34,870
Can I put this on my Maple Scout?

2065
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:38,470
Who are you calling Jade?

2066
02:15:44,590 --> 02:15:45,810
Definitely rod upgrades.

2067
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:49,850
Alright, like I really feel like I need them.

2068
02:15:55,690 --> 02:15:59,170
Oh, we can max out the strength!

2069
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:01,370
Huge.

2070
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:04,810
Okay, let's go get some more money.

2071
02:16:08,690 --> 02:16:18,070
supposed to work on any rod okay we'll get some more wallies
and then we will make a big big buku bucks and then we'll

2072
02:16:18,070 --> 02:16:20,270
buy the the lures

2073
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:30,230
i still don't think i can get the big guy but we'll see he
might be too big

2074
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:45,000
this or dredge oh no no i love dredge i love dredge i was
literally thinking of dredge the other day and i think

2075
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:52,920
that's what influenced me to get this to get this and play
it i was like man i just dredge you know what also like

2076
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:56,540
scratched and itch that dredge kind of scratched was uh Dave
the Diver.

2077
02:16:58,100 --> 02:16:59,980
That game was also so fun, too.

2078
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:01,180
Oh, man.

2079
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:02,420
I love dredge, though.

2080
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:04,620
I love dredge.

2081
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:11,720
Did you finish, Dave?

2082
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:13,240
I did, I did, actually.

2083
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:18,600
Hey, big boy.

2084
02:17:20,840 --> 02:17:21,700
Oh, wow.

2085
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:22,700
We lost it immediately.

2086
02:17:25,660 --> 02:17:27,500
That was pretty pathetic.

2087
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:30,720
Just I started Dredge today.

2088
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:32,320
I think you'll like it.

2089
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:33,360
I hope you like it.

2090
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:37,400
You'll need an XL rod for the big guy.

2091
02:17:38,420 --> 02:17:39,680
Well, let him.

2092
02:17:39,720 --> 02:17:41,220
We'll just ignore him for now.

2093
02:17:42,060 --> 02:17:42,380
Hey you.

2094
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:43,340
Hey you.

2095
02:17:43,980 --> 02:17:44,180
No!

2096
02:17:51,340 --> 02:17:53,720
You made me miss the other guy.

2097
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:05,800
Dredge had the right amount of unsettling and comfy.

2098
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:06,600
Yeah.

2099
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:11,440
I just, I wish I could, I wish there was like an endless
mode.

2100
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,620
Which I guess you could just keep going.

2101
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:16,660
You could just never do the story at all.

2102
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:22,280
Made him near the surface.

2103
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:24,600
Oh, wait, that's so smart.

2104
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:27,760
Come on.

2105
02:18:28,040 --> 02:18:29,500
Hey, stop going crazy.

2106
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:30,740
What is this?

2107
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:35,520
Dredge roguelike.

2108
02:18:36,960 --> 02:18:38,320
It's just so fun.

2109
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:39,920
Fishing games are just, I don't know.

2110
02:18:40,420 --> 02:18:46,920
They're like calming and like they're exactly like just so
nice.

2111
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:50,420
Maybe I do always wish I was wishing I was

2112
02:18:54,020 --> 02:18:54,420
Oh, whoops.

2113
02:18:55,300 --> 02:18:56,920
Oh, what are you barking at?

2114
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:58,760
What are you barking at, boy?

2115
02:19:03,270 --> 02:19:04,490
They're peaceful and simple.

2116
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:05,790
I saw that, what's it called?

2117
02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:06,450
That new

2118
02:19:09,470 --> 02:19:22,210
game is going to be the one that i did the demo for that
should be coming out soon-ish so we could check that out

2119
02:19:24,310 --> 02:19:35,230
yeah the fish head one yeah yeah yeah the fishing one
fishing is in right now fishing games are in fishing games

2120
02:19:35,230 --> 02:19:36,950
really get you hooked

2121
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:45,240
Do I need to rebrand?

2122
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:50,060
Do I need to become a fisher instead of a maid?

2123
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:52,760
A ghost fisher?

2124
02:20:04,170 --> 02:20:04,570
Juanito.

2125
02:20:04,850 --> 02:20:05,450
It wasn't me.

2126
02:20:05,590 --> 02:20:06,330
It was a super chat.

2127
02:20:06,630 --> 02:20:08,330
Thank you so much for the super chat, by the way.

2128
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:12,530
Fisher maid.

2129
02:20:13,210 --> 02:20:15,090
Yeah, but I can't be a ghost fisher maid.

2130
02:20:15,750 --> 02:20:18,510
Something's gotta go and I can't really get rid of the ghost
part.

2131
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:24,740
Please!

2132
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:28,240
One thing about these guys, though, is the pain in the butt.

2133
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:32,300
Whoa, my biggest Wally!

2134
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:37,000
Let's go.

2135
02:20:47,710 --> 02:20:48,990
I think there was one more.

2136
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:53,330
Like the flying Dutchman.

2137
02:20:53,590 --> 02:20:54,090
Oh my gosh.

2138
02:20:54,970 --> 02:20:55,430
What if?

2139
02:20:55,590 --> 02:20:56,370
Come on.

2140
02:20:56,910 --> 02:20:58,410
Oh my god, he just...

2141
02:20:59,670 --> 02:21:01,010
He's too fast.

2142
02:21:01,690 --> 02:21:02,570
That's scary.

2143
02:21:02,670 --> 02:21:03,190
Oh my gosh!

2144
02:21:06,610 --> 02:21:07,870
Guys, I did it!

2145
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:21,280
Legendary catch!

2146
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:25,200
Land a big enough Wally to get on the wall in Rusty's tackle
shop.

2147
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:31,580
He literally just, like, jumped into my boat.

2148
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:32,520
He wanted me.

2149
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,220
He wanted to be here.

2150
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:38,280
That was crazy.

2151
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:40,740
Legendary fish.

2152
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:41,320
You know what?

2153
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:42,160
Let's just go.

2154
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:44,080
Let's go turn in our...

2155
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:47,600
I got it all on camera!

2156
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:49,940
Send it to the news!

2157
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:51,740
Send it to the news!

2158
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:55,560
Send it to the news!

2159
02:21:56,500 --> 02:21:57,020
Awesome.

2160
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:02,160
Rusty will never believe this.

2161
02:22:07,220 --> 02:22:08,500
Ten sets no fish.

2162
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:10,040
The lake's boss.

2163
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:13,440
Tell the internet!

2164
02:22:14,140 --> 02:22:15,180
Post it on TikTok!

2165
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:19,900
Please draw Minto next to our legendary guest.

Trophy's yours.

2171
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:54,920
And there's a new legend over the counter.

2172
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:58,200
Just don't let it get to your head.

2173
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:00,780
Wally, have a way of humbling folks.

2174
02:23:01,060 --> 02:23:02,080
Yeah, she's annoying.

2175
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:02,920
That guy was annoying.

2176
02:23:03,780 --> 02:23:04,160
Oh, whoops.

2177
02:23:04,220 --> 02:23:05,180
She just says the same thing.

2178
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:08,100
Nice!

2179
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:12,260
Oh my gosh, we're so close to even to getting the timber
jack.

2180
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:14,880
But...

2181
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:16,740
Wait, can I not buy these here?

2182
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:19,540
Oh, I guess I can.

2183
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:21,600
Oh, it shows me...

2184
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:23,760
Oh, it shows what I don't have.

2185
02:23:23,900 --> 02:23:24,880
Yeah, I'm stupid.

2186
02:23:28,300 --> 02:23:29,540
We'll get that.

2187
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:34,340
Fishermaid is trending.

2188
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:35,740
News travels fast.

2189
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:38,740
Let's just get all the baits.

2190
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:39,820
Or, I mean, the lure, sorry.

2191
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:43,800
And then...

2192
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:45,340
We can max this.

2193
02:23:45,460 --> 02:23:46,500
Oh, my gosh.

2194
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:48,400
We're killing it.

2195
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:49,260
We're killing it.

2196
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:53,920
And that's maxed!

2197
02:23:56,580 --> 02:23:56,980
Next?

2198
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:02,580
I gotta get 200 coin for a boat.

2199
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:05,860
Oh, I forgot about my storage too, my inventory.

2200
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:12,950
I just focused on the upgrades for now.

2201
02:24:13,070 --> 02:24:14,430
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.

2202
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:18,670
I think we can go to the next area.

2203
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:26,020
Uh, Yeah, we're gonna keep on fishing.

2204
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:27,620
Go to Beaver Dam.

2205
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:31,800
Alright,

2206
02:24:37,770 --> 02:24:38,410
now...

2207
02:24:38,410 --> 02:24:40,950
Let's stop right here.

2208
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:48,670
And let's get our drop shot on for the long-nose sucker.

2209
02:24:49,870 --> 02:24:50,790
Or the jig head.

2210
02:24:51,110 --> 02:24:52,030
We'll try the jig head.

2211
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:55,710
I guess the Maple Scout is what we need.

2212
02:24:57,150 --> 02:24:57,790
Alright.

2213
02:24:59,050 --> 02:25:00,050
We're gonna keep on fishing.

2214
02:25:00,070 --> 02:25:01,450
fishing and take, aren't you?

2215
02:25:03,630 --> 02:25:05,290
Does she know it's walleye?

2216
02:25:05,530 --> 02:25:06,650
Or is she just being silly?

2217
02:25:07,930 --> 02:25:09,310
I'm always serious.

2218
02:25:10,170 --> 02:25:11,750
I'm always very serious, actually.

2219
02:25:14,990 --> 02:25:17,010
He's tiny, but he packs a punch.

2220
02:25:19,830 --> 02:25:20,870
Large mouthpass!

2221
02:25:22,410 --> 02:25:22,870
Yippee!

2222
02:25:23,770 --> 02:25:25,090
Wait, what about this guy over here?

2223
02:25:28,250 --> 02:25:30,050
I've never told a joke ever once.

2224
02:25:33,090 --> 02:25:35,530
I've never told a single joke.

2225
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,980
I don't even know how to smile.

2226
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:48,780
I can't believe that guy literally jumped into my boat.

2227
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:53,280
I think fish do want me.

2228
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:58,020
Fish want me.

2229
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,100
Women want me.

2230
02:26:04,780 --> 02:26:07,120
Yeah, big ol' bears.

2231
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:07,960
Let's go.

2232
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:12,000
They call her straight-faced Minto.

2233
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:16,160
She's never...

2234
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:17,100
She was born...

2235
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:23,280
When she was born, aka died, she never laughed.

2236
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:29,520
There's a lot of these guys here, so...

2237
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:31,220
Oh, Minto!

2238
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:32,520
Oh, ha!

2239
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:33,540
Oh, ho!

2240
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:35,600
Yes.

2241
02:26:39,050 --> 02:26:40,310
Come on, come on.

2242
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:43,050
Come on.

2243
02:26:43,270 --> 02:26:44,130
Kuy, kuy, kuy.

2244
02:26:45,050 --> 02:26:46,030
They've never told a joke?

2245
02:26:46,350 --> 02:26:47,530
Why so serial?

2246
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:52,630
No, no, no!

2247
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:54,910
No, he's gone rogue!

2248
02:26:59,060 --> 02:27:00,200
You bastard.

2249
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:01,180
Mood.

2250
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:05,500
There was rain on the day she was born.

2251
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:12,180
This guy's been tailing me.

2252
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:13,520
So interested.

2253
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:19,730
All right, let's go show.

2254
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:24,330
Dang fish.

2255
02:27:24,690 --> 02:27:25,450
I know.

2256
02:27:28,490 --> 02:27:29,090
Dang!

2257
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:34,450
You really start getting money, like, really fast once,
uh...

2258
02:27:35,410 --> 02:27:36,250
Well, I'll be.

2259
02:27:36,970 --> 02:27:37,990
A haul like that?

2260
02:27:38,110 --> 02:27:39,030
You're on fire.

2261
02:27:39,130 --> 02:27:40,270
That's what I'm saying.

2262
02:27:40,390 --> 02:27:41,350
That's what I'm saying.

2263
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:46,840
I did have an...

2264
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:47,940
Oh, this exclamation point.

2265
02:27:50,060 --> 02:27:51,040
Thanks, I hate.

2266
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:53,040
Ain't nothing like hauling.

2267
02:27:53,060 --> 02:27:57,320
in a fat old large mouth bass after giving you a workout.

2268
02:27:58,160 --> 02:28:02,000
Heard there's a swarm of little rock bass up at the
mistwood.

2269
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:05,540
Thicker than skeezers on a July evening.

2270
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:08,540
Ta-per-ta-ku!

2271
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:13,340
I think they'll never jokes, but I know this cool guy named
Hugh Morris.

2272
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:16,140
That's got a lot of jokes in Riz.

2273
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:20,040
I watched the Japanese direct for...

2274
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:23,040
for...

2275
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:26,980
What's it called?

2276
02:28:27,560 --> 02:28:30,440
For Tomodachi Life after this morning.

2277
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:33,200
And they did not...

2278
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:33,460
Okay.

2279
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,420
They didn't have a clown.

2280
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:39,220
Like Hugh Morris.

2281
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:41,260
The Miis were different.

2282
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:43,660
Yeah, the Miis were different and they didn't have a clown.

2283
02:28:44,460 --> 02:28:46,560
The EU version had a clown.

2284
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:53,040
But you know how after the girl gets rejected by Patrick?

2285
02:28:53,060 --> 02:28:58,740
in the Tomodachi Life American one and she also gets
rejected by a guy in the EU one.

2286
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:02,500
She goes to Hugh Morris, right?

2287
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:16,300
But in the Japanese version, because there's no clown guy,
she instead goes with her old man professor.

2288
02:29:20,140 --> 02:29:21,760
I was like, wait a second.

2289
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:26,440
I was like, wait, wait, wait.

2290
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:31,460
Like, she's just like...

2291
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:33,240
She calls him, like, something, Sensei.

2292
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:35,920
And I was like, um...

2293
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:46,460
So instead, the Western versions put in a clown!

2294
02:29:53,370 --> 02:29:55,030
It's so funny.

2295
02:29:57,930 --> 02:29:59,250
Did he reject her, too?

2296
02:29:59,350 --> 02:29:59,830
Yeah, yeah.

2297
02:29:59,910 --> 02:30:02,350
He went with, like, the other...

2298
02:30:02,370 --> 02:30:13,230
a professor or other teacher or whoever who uh who that she
was also wearing like the sheet the shirt that said like i

2299
02:30:13,230 --> 02:30:26,310

2300
02:30:26,310 --> 02:30:34,170
golden fork river wow wait but i haven't even gotten the
fish here yet wait wait wait why does that seem so

2301
02:30:34,170 --> 02:30:48,350
quintessentially JP it's so it really is at least he was a
responsible adult I guess look I'm not I'm not judging her

2302
02:30:48,350 --> 02:31:04,450
for you know being attracted to an older gentleman you know
but it's just very funny that is that a It's just very funny

2303
02:31:04,450 --> 02:31:13,830
that that was the Japanese version while the the western
versions were all like Oh yeah, clowns

2304
02:31:20,030 --> 02:31:31,110
So funny Okay, let's see what we got here Because I think I
discovered a new guy Brown trout Beaver dam the beaver Oh,

2305
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:33,850
oh, crap pie Oh,

2306
02:31:37,870 --> 02:31:40,150
that looks like a cat Catfish.

2307
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:42,550
Guys, the crap pie!

2308
02:31:42,730 --> 02:31:43,610
Okay, spoon bait.

2309
02:31:44,570 --> 02:31:45,350
Maybe there's one here.

2310
02:31:49,430 --> 02:31:50,870
I have a heavy spoon bait.

2311
02:31:51,370 --> 02:31:51,910
That should work.

2312
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,720
Fish names are so fun.

2313
02:31:57,800 --> 02:31:58,160
Oh, wait.

2314
02:31:58,320 --> 02:32:00,020
Is it this tiny guy right here?

2315
02:32:03,580 --> 02:32:04,100
No,

2316
02:32:07,190 --> 02:32:07,710
that's...

2317
02:32:07,710 --> 02:32:08,430
Okay.

2318
02:32:08,750 --> 02:32:10,470
I think we gotta go to the smaller one.

2319
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:18,020
Crap pie.

2320
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:21,760
Oh, was it crappy?

2321
02:32:26,860 --> 02:32:27,800
What is it?

2322
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:36,440
Is it a crappy?

2323
02:32:53,170 --> 02:32:54,710
Yeah, guys, I was just kidding.

2324
02:33:00,850 --> 02:33:02,870
I know it was a crappy this whole time.

2325
02:33:04,210 --> 02:33:05,270
That's so silly.

2326
02:33:05,450 --> 02:33:07,210
Whoa, this guy has, like, glowing eyes.

2327
02:33:07,290 --> 02:33:07,990
What's up with him?

2328
02:33:08,450 --> 02:33:08,590
Oh.

2329
02:33:19,890 --> 02:33:21,790
It's not a Wally.

2330
02:33:24,550 --> 02:33:25,450
What the heck?

2331
02:33:25,610 --> 02:33:28,730
Every time I try to get the big guys, I switch to the other
side.

2332
02:33:33,010 --> 02:33:34,310
Serious professional VTuber.

2333
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:35,170
I'm a VTuber.

2334
02:33:35,530 --> 02:33:37,370
I never said I was a V-reader.

2335
02:33:40,810 --> 02:33:41,410
Oh, oops.

2336
02:33:41,790 --> 02:33:42,950
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

2337
02:33:44,750 --> 02:33:46,190
Yeah, drop shop.

2338
02:33:47,510 --> 02:33:48,310
Wait, stop, stop, stop!

2339
02:33:53,130 --> 02:33:55,310
Most people pronounce it croppy.

2340
02:33:55,590 --> 02:33:57,670
It, like, crops in a field.

2341
02:33:58,830 --> 02:34:01,470
Well, that's just denying his proper name.

2342
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:05,530
I think I know what they went for.

2343
02:34:07,690 --> 02:34:09,590
I know what the intentions were.

2344
02:34:12,730 --> 02:34:14,810
Someone had a bad time with that guy.

2345
02:34:17,190 --> 02:34:18,630
Crappy and proud.

2346
02:34:19,410 --> 02:34:19,590
Ooh!

2347
02:34:20,850 --> 02:34:22,290
Trophy weight catch!

2348
02:34:22,650 --> 02:34:23,430
Let's go!

2349
02:34:23,890 --> 02:34:24,530
Let's go.

2350
02:34:27,550 --> 02:34:28,970
I've never heard crappy.

2351
02:34:29,230 --> 02:34:29,610
Uh oh.

2352
02:34:29,850 --> 02:34:30,230
Uh oh.

2353
02:34:30,350 --> 02:34:31,410
The fishers are fighting.

2354
02:34:35,710 --> 02:34:37,450
These guys are easy to catch too.

2355
02:34:37,910 --> 02:34:39,110
I hope they're worth lots of money.

2356
02:34:42,190 --> 02:34:43,230
We got catfish.

2357
02:34:44,090 --> 02:34:45,610
Have you guys ever been catfish before?

2358
02:34:47,770 --> 02:34:54,430
Like, I think I have not talked to enough people to, like,
online to feel like I...

2359
02:34:54,430 --> 02:34:55,890
To be catfish.

2360
02:34:57,350 --> 02:35:02,070
Like, actually, like, a lot of people that I met were, like,
at anime conventions and stuff, so...

2361
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:04,970
No, no.

2362
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:15,700
I guess, like, I don't know.

2363
02:35:17,160 --> 02:35:22,920
Like, you hear about the people that get catfish, and
they're like, Oh, I've known this person for five years.

2364
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:29,720
and we've never talked, we've only talked on the phone and
like a voice call or something, we've never video called.

2365
02:35:32,820 --> 02:35:33,880
Things like that.

2366
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:41,720
But I'm just like, at that point, if I were, you know, if I
were just friends with the person, maybe it'd be one thing.

2367
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:49,420
But if it's like a romantic attraction, I think it would be
wise to video call.

2368
02:35:50,600 --> 02:35:52,580
My Nigerian prince friend is real.

2369
02:35:52,940 --> 02:35:53,900
I believe, I believe.

2370
02:35:57,140 --> 02:35:58,560
Yeah, I know that guy's real.

2371
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:01,780
Back with a bounty, eh?

2372
02:36:02,060 --> 02:36:03,600
Your rod's earning its cape.

2373
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:04,840
Ah, yeah.

2374
02:36:05,180 --> 02:36:07,040
All right, let's, uh...

2375
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:08,140
What are the licenses?

2376
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:12,340
I'm afraid to press it, because I don't know what it will
do.

2377
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:16,300
Oh, we can get the leaky bucket!

2378
02:36:19,420 --> 02:36:20,880
Oh, motor speed.

2379
02:36:25,060 --> 02:36:26,940
Wait, so if I...

2380
02:36:31,540 --> 02:36:32,380
Probably unlocks places.

2381
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:32,940
I guess so.

2382
02:36:33,320 --> 02:36:36,520
One time someone texted me pretending they were a girl I had
a crush on is a prank!

2383
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:38,400
I don't know if that counts.

2384
02:36:38,740 --> 02:36:39,140
What the heck?

2385
02:36:39,320 --> 02:36:43,580
I occasionally get texts from a person that like caught...

2386
02:36:43,580 --> 02:36:44,220
They're just like...

2387
02:36:44,220 --> 02:36:47,940
They are constantly telling whoever they're trying to text
to wake up.

2388
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:49,420
They're like, wake up!

2389
02:36:49,740 --> 02:36:50,140
Wake up!

2390
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:50,780
I'm here!

2391
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:51,760
Wake up!

2392
02:36:51,820 --> 02:36:52,620
Get out of bed!

2393
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:54,380
Like, how do they know?

2394
02:36:55,640 --> 02:36:57,800
If their texts are going to me.

2395
02:36:59,300 --> 02:37:01,580
Is this person just asleep all the time?

2396
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:09,090
I wasn't one of the girls he was dating by pretending to be
a lesbian, so it wasn't as bad for me.

2397
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:10,600
Wait.

2398
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:13,580
Oh.

2399
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:16,400
So you were just friends?

2400
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:29,000
All right, five, wait, six fish in our leaky bucket.

2401
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:31,560
That's right, that's right.

2402
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:34,160
I think we should start aiming for the timber jack too,
maybe.

2403
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:37,820
Let's get all the, did I get all the fish in here actually?

2404
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:39,160
No, I think about it.

2405
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:42,560
Wait, change boat.

2406
02:37:44,220 --> 02:37:44,480
Yeah!

2407
02:37:46,980 --> 02:37:48,940
Have you ever dreamed that you were streaming?

2408
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:52,140
When I first started streaming, like all the time.

2409
02:37:52,940 --> 02:37:55,220
I would have nightmares that I was still streaming.

2410
02:37:55,640 --> 02:37:57,740
And I would nightmares that I was like streaming.

2411
02:37:58,320 --> 02:37:58,940
And that...

2412
02:38:04,990 --> 02:38:07,390
I would have nightmares that I would be streaming.

2413
02:38:07,570 --> 02:38:08,990
And I would fart in my sleep.

2414
02:38:09,170 --> 02:38:11,090
And then you guys would...

2415
02:38:30,410 --> 02:38:32,570
That wasn't a dream.

2416
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:33,910
What, no!

2417
02:38:37,900 --> 02:38:39,820
That wasn't a nightmare, me.

2418
02:38:41,380 --> 02:38:45,420
Did you wake up screaming when you were dreaming of
streaming?

2419
02:38:46,600 --> 02:38:49,940
Oh, he got sick of me.

2420
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:50,920
He got sick of waiting.

2421
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:56,520
I once got random calls and voicemails from four different
people looking for an Evan to deliver his grandma's meds.

2422
02:38:56,860 --> 02:38:57,900
Why is that so sad?

2423
02:38:58,080 --> 02:38:59,500
That's like important stuff.

2424
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:02,720
It was a premonition.

2425
02:39:03,380 --> 02:39:04,940
That's why I don't sleep on stream.

2426
02:39:05,760 --> 02:39:05,940
Oh.

2427
02:39:09,640 --> 02:39:10,940
It's just so funny.

2428
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:14,480
Yeah.

2429
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:16,220
I've told this story before.

2430
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:26,200
but one time I had a dream that I was posting a link to
something that I was like watching in chat but I

2431
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:35,820
accidentally copied the link of a Jake Paul video and then I
posted that in chat and everybody made fun of me and they

2432
02:39:35,820 --> 02:39:46,810
were like man watch his Jake Paul man watch his Jake Paul
and I was like no I don't know I never like I've never

2433
02:39:46,810 --> 02:39:48,430
watched Jake Paul before and

2434
02:39:55,250 --> 02:39:56,450
That was forever ago.

2435
02:39:56,550 --> 02:39:57,990
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

2436
02:39:58,990 --> 02:40:01,530
Yeah, I don't have dreams about streaming anymore, though.

2437
02:40:01,790 --> 02:40:04,450
The other night I had a dream about being a spy.

2438
02:40:05,110 --> 02:40:07,250
I was like a spy kid.

2439
02:40:08,610 --> 02:40:14,090
And I remember there was like, I had like a agent partner,
right?

2440
02:40:14,270 --> 02:40:15,450
Like another spy.

2441
02:40:15,710 --> 02:40:17,710
And he was a guy in my room.

2442
02:40:17,790 --> 02:40:20,010
I was trying to hide him from my mom.

2443
02:40:20,650 --> 02:40:22,010
Because I was just like, this is important.

2444
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:23,450
My mom doesn't know I'm a spy.

2445
02:40:23,630 --> 02:40:24,790
And we're like investigating.

2446
02:40:24,810 --> 02:40:35,350
something in this important spy business and I was like it
was like he would like he would like sit in my room I

2447
02:40:35,350 --> 02:40:41,610
remember I would try to disguise him like as like a teddy
bear and he would sit in my room like crisscross applesauce

2448
02:40:41,610 --> 02:40:50,570
but he was like massive he was like the biggest adult ever
my mom would come into my room be like where'd that teddy

2449
02:40:50,570 --> 02:40:58,670
bear come from don't worry about it mom i'm just a kid i'm
just a kid of course i would have a teddy bear in my room

2450
02:41:01,610 --> 02:41:15,730
the et strategy how are you sure about that your mom isn't a
spy she's spying on me oh my gosh drama how does that stack

2451
02:41:15,730 --> 02:41:19,790
up to the time you dreamt about pooping oh my gosh yes i
once dreamt that i

2452
02:41:23,810 --> 02:41:34,410
I don't sleep with my earbuds in anymore because one time
one fell out and it like somehow is I guess I rolled around

2453
02:41:34,410 --> 02:41:43,670
a lot and it and it kind of like got underneath my back and
I had a dream that I pooped out a rock and I was so I was so

2454
02:41:43,670 --> 02:41:48,970
sad about it I was crying I was crying about it and

2455
02:41:53,390 --> 02:42:04,890
I was like because I mean I would think I think anybody
would cry if they pooped out a rock because that's really

2456
02:42:04,890 --> 02:42:13,330
concerning how did that how did that get in there I'm crying
I'm crying thinking about it again

2457
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:28,040
is that a rock fact why is it this guy catching anything
What I'm doing is auto time.

2458
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:29,060
What?

2459
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:30,700
There's no one's biting.

2460
02:42:33,100 --> 02:42:34,340
Oh my gosh.

2461
02:42:36,460 --> 02:42:37,400
No one's biting.

2462
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:44,040
Yeah, the princess in the pee moment.

2463
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:45,380
Actually, actually.

2464
02:42:46,780 --> 02:42:49,420
Princess in the pee 2020's edition sounds weird.

2465
02:42:50,740 --> 02:42:53,220
Just thinking about pooping out rocks.

2466
02:42:56,400 --> 02:42:59,140
Oh, I forgot we got six things now.

2467
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:00,340
Alright.

2468
02:43:03,700 --> 02:43:04,480
Let's see.

2469
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:08,120
Um, I think we've caught everything in this.

2470
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:09,600
Oh, no.

2471
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:10,480
The crappy.

2472
02:43:11,260 --> 02:43:12,140
The crap pie.

2473
02:43:14,880 --> 02:43:15,620
Good morning, Vito.

2474
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:16,700
It's my birthday today.

2475
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:18,800
Can I get a birthday?

2476
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:19,560
Tofu!

2477
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:20,980
Happy birthday.

2478
02:43:23,950 --> 02:43:24,830
Happy, happy birthday.

2479
02:43:25,690 --> 02:43:28,270
All of this after saying you are not a funny Vito.

2480
02:43:29,190 --> 02:43:31,730
I don't know if my dreams are very funny.

2481
02:43:32,890 --> 02:43:33,670
Spoon bite.

2482
02:43:38,580 --> 02:43:39,400
I think a small spoon.

2483
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:40,160
Oh, for the crappy.

2484
02:43:43,460 --> 02:43:44,980
Best for a crap pie.

2485
02:43:47,020 --> 02:43:47,260
Alright.

2486
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:49,460
I'm cooking up some crap pie.

2487
02:43:51,720 --> 02:43:52,920
Do you remember getting to stream?

2488
02:43:53,660 --> 02:43:54,720
How did you get here?

2489
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:55,900
And what were you doing before?

2490
02:43:56,080 --> 02:43:58,820
Inception made me question everything after watching the
movie.

2491
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:01,960
I think I remember.

2492
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:03,740
What did I do today?

2493
02:44:04,220 --> 02:44:05,800
Today was pretty laid back for me, actually.

2494
02:44:06,820 --> 02:44:12,920
Yesterday I did, like, so much work that I was like, today,
we're taking it easy.

2495
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:16,800
What are these guys?

2496
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:18,160
Are these tiny crappies?

2497
02:44:20,420 --> 02:44:21,260
Did you get to nap?

2498
02:44:21,320 --> 02:44:21,680
I did!

2499
02:44:22,180 --> 02:44:24,420
I took, like, a, I took, like, a little bit of a nap.

2500
02:44:25,280 --> 02:44:27,200
Okay, that's... This is clearly not our...

2501
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:28,360
Not our dino.

2502
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:40,320
So, I've been watching this guy he's been like trying to oh
he's been trying to ride the dinosaur ride at animal kingdom

2503
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:50,100
as many times as possible and before the ride shuts down
he's at like 200 right now it's kind of crazy but he's been

2504
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:59,300
going at it for like two weeks and now he'll be before he
was just like He was like 13 days until dinosaur closes and

2505
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:15,480
now you guys now he's saying hours now he's what is this one
he's saying hours now he's like a hundred hours until

2506
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:20,380
dinosaur closes oh it's so painful

2507
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:27,040
It's so sad.

2508
02:45:27,500 --> 02:45:29,060
Maybe it's a large mouth bass.

2509
02:45:30,900 --> 02:45:31,740
But he's huge.

2510
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:33,300
Or a brown...

2511
02:45:33,300 --> 02:45:35,560
I wonder if this is the boss of this river.

2512
02:45:38,660 --> 02:45:40,300
Do we need to do another dinosaur karaoke?

2513
02:45:41,260 --> 02:45:42,920
No, I'm okay, I'm okay.

2514
02:45:46,960 --> 02:45:50,360
I am pretty sad though that I didn't get to go on it one
more time.

2515
02:45:54,260 --> 02:45:56,180
Oh, he doesn't seem interested at all.

2516
02:45:57,420 --> 02:45:57,940
Hello?

2517
02:45:59,380 --> 02:45:59,900
Hello?

2518
02:46:01,280 --> 02:46:01,700
Hello?

2519
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:05,200
It's the large mouth bass, so I'm right, right?

2520
02:46:08,320 --> 02:46:08,840
Jighead.

2521
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:10,140
I think that's what I put on.

2522
02:46:22,060 --> 02:46:28,140
But I have somebody that was going to the parks and they
asked, you know what's really messed up?

2523
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:28,580
They...

2524
02:46:28,580 --> 02:46:28,660
Oh.

2525
02:46:29,660 --> 02:46:30,220
Are you interested?

2526
02:46:30,460 --> 02:46:30,560
Oh.

2527
02:46:31,080 --> 02:46:31,660
I'll take you.

2528
02:46:33,060 --> 02:46:34,320
They are putting out merch.

2529
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:35,800
Can you believe this?

2530
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:40,680
They are putting out merch for the closure of this ride.

2531
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:43,520
I'm angry about it.

2532
02:46:45,140 --> 02:46:46,440
I think this guy can't see.

2533
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:50,080
I think he's blind, and I don't mean...

2534
02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:51,240
I mean that, like, literally.

2535
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:54,520
Graduation merch!

2536
02:46:54,620 --> 02:46:55,120
It is!

2537
02:46:55,180 --> 02:46:56,660
It's graduation merch!

2538
02:46:56,860 --> 02:46:57,440
For real!

2539
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:02,860
Yeah, but somebody is going to the parks.

2540
02:47:03,060 --> 02:47:11,880
for me and they said that they would try and get me a hat if
there were any left oops

2541
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:25,500
when you put it like that it sounds messed up it's funny
because like idols i i guess i guess it depends on the

2542
02:47:25,500 --> 02:47:37,400
vtuber i know hololive they do graduation merch right don't
they sometimes depends but uh okay I don't think I can get

2543
02:47:37,400 --> 02:47:55,990
that guy or just yeah but um depends yeah sometimes I do but
uh yeah idols like like like you know regular idols not

2544
02:47:55,990 --> 02:48:04,510
VTuber idols or anything they put out graduation merch like
all the time it's like nothing even remotely like strange

2545
02:48:04,510 --> 02:48:12,330
but i don't know it feels to me like you know it feels
completely different because when an idol graduates like

2546
02:48:12,330 --> 02:48:20,830
it's her decision that she wants to do something else you
know like here they decided that it was the end of dinosaur

2547
02:48:20,830 --> 02:48:29,950
you know what i mean like they chose to close the ride like
this is not dinosaur's decision So it makes me angry.

2548
02:48:33,690 --> 02:48:38,350
I feel like it's less weird when an artist is doing it as a
farewell than when a corporal is cynically doing it for

2549
02:48:38,350 --> 02:48:38,630
profits.

2550
02:48:38,750 --> 02:48:39,850
Exactly, exactly.

2551
02:48:41,390 --> 02:48:43,190
I have some of the Pikami graduation merch.

2552
02:48:43,470 --> 02:48:43,910
Me too.

2553
02:48:44,250 --> 02:48:44,550
Me too.

2554
02:48:44,650 --> 02:48:46,090
I was just looking at my Pikami.

2555
02:48:47,150 --> 02:48:49,330
I was going, I was searching for some stuff.

2556
02:48:50,990 --> 02:48:52,030
Oh my gosh, yeah.

2557
02:48:52,250 --> 02:48:58,230
I was, I, um, yeah, I found my Pikachu.

2558
02:48:58,530 --> 02:48:58,930
Pikachu.

2559
02:48:59,110 --> 02:48:59,350
Oh my gosh.

2560
02:48:59,410 --> 02:48:59,930
My Pikami.

2561
02:49:01,830 --> 02:49:10,030
uh face mask like the eye eye mask um black text white
background thank you for your continued support of dinosaur

2562
02:49:10,030 --> 02:49:19,150
the ride but i found that my pygmy eye mask because uh good
luck to dinosaur the ride and their future endeavors i want

2563
02:49:19,150 --> 02:49:27,090
them to send or not send i want them to sell some of the
stuff like the i wonder if if it's possible to buy some of

2564
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:29,150
the ass not that Do you call them assets?

2565
02:49:29,310 --> 02:49:29,850
What do you call them?

2566
02:49:29,910 --> 02:49:31,850
The decorations of Dinosaur the Ride?

2567
02:49:32,650 --> 02:49:34,390
Like the things that say the Dinosaur Institute?

2568
02:49:34,850 --> 02:49:35,570
I want that.

2569
02:49:35,970 --> 02:49:36,790
I want that.

2570
02:49:38,070 --> 02:49:41,990
But the reason I found my peek-a-me-eye mask earlier is
because...

2571
02:49:42,670 --> 02:49:43,750
Oh my gosh, you guys.

2572
02:49:43,850 --> 02:49:46,670
I'm such a stinking sucker for...

2573
02:49:48,410 --> 02:49:49,970
For technology gimmicks.

2574
02:49:50,270 --> 02:49:50,510
Okay.

2575
02:49:51,610 --> 02:49:52,050
Like...

2576
02:49:52,050 --> 02:49:53,270
And I mean that.

2577
02:49:53,370 --> 02:49:56,310
So I saw a video the other day that was just like...

2578
02:49:57,990 --> 02:50:09,910
fall of the one plus phone things like that i had a one plus
phone i had a one plus phone and in the video they mentioned

2579
02:50:09,910 --> 02:50:17,670
the next the next bit the next bit phone i had that phone i
had that and then they also mentioned the essential phone i

2580
02:50:17,670 --> 02:50:24,160
had that phone i had that and i was like i don't i i guess i
don't consider myself like a

2581
02:50:27,990 --> 02:50:35,830
am a sucker for a gimmick and so recently i was kind of
looking at the new s26 that like the features of that it's

2582
02:50:35,830 --> 02:50:44,770
kind of awesome though like you are the subject of the video
pretty much um did you have a windows phone at some point

2583
02:50:47,870 --> 02:51:14,110
shut up shut up anyway um if you have you guys seen the
features ultra because it's kind of all it's not i mean it's

2584
02:51:14,110 --> 02:51:21,310
not even just the ultra it's kind of awesome though because
it has like a privacy screen feature on it like built into

2585
02:51:21,310 --> 02:51:29,810
the phone and then also you can dim how much you want the
privacy screen to be like shown and then also with yeah you

2586
02:51:29,810 --> 02:51:39,050
can have selective privacy so you can be like i don't mind
if my whole screen is shown but for like text alerts and

2587
02:51:39,050 --> 02:51:44,550
text like you know notifications that pop up i want those
Only to be privacy screen.

2588
02:51:44,630 --> 02:51:45,950
It's kind of insane.

2589
02:51:46,730 --> 02:51:48,410
I was like, whoa, wait.

2590
02:51:49,550 --> 02:51:51,270
This is like kind of nice.

2591
02:51:53,670 --> 02:51:58,290
And so I was thinking, you know, my phone, I don't need one.

2592
02:51:58,510 --> 02:52:02,750
But I've been kind of like, I get itching for a new phone.

2593
02:52:03,010 --> 02:52:06,270
And that's why I've had, that's why I've had the next bit.

2594
02:52:06,430 --> 02:52:09,990
And that's why I've had the essential phone.

2595
02:52:10,110 --> 02:52:11,930
And that's why I've had a OnePlus phone.

2596
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:20,170
i've had all these phones because i'm like i'm just i like
little gadgets you know i love buying new gadgets i even had

2597
02:52:20,170 --> 02:52:30,910
for my essential phone if you don't know what that was the
essential phone i i charged it earlier it still works um but

2598
02:52:30,910 --> 02:52:43,850
what what is this the time oh is this the idle time was that
okay uh flagship tech is fun i know and usually they try new

2599
02:52:43,850 --> 02:52:53,410
things like i was looking at the nothing phone earlier too
if i had a better camera i would probably get it but um uh

2600
02:52:53,410 --> 02:52:59,470
the essential phone was pretty cool because it had like
little it had two little notches in the back of the phone

2601
02:52:59,470 --> 02:53:09,570
and they were like advertising attachments for it and so
what i had was like a 360 cam attachment that like was

2602
02:53:09,570 --> 02:53:20,790
magnetic it almost like a like the mag like the mag safe you
know like magnetic ring and it yeah like it just attaches to

2603
02:53:20,790 --> 02:53:34,290
it and then i i have filled i filled things with my 360
camera it was pretty cool yeah so modular phones i know it's

2604
02:53:34,290 --> 02:53:39,210
just like you know I think, honestly, I would love...

2605
02:53:39,210 --> 02:53:40,130
Biggest catch!

2606
02:53:40,590 --> 02:53:40,690
Nice.

2607
02:53:41,270 --> 02:53:45,130
I would love Samsung more if it didn't have all, like, the
bloatware and everything.

2608
02:53:46,290 --> 02:53:46,730
But...

2609
02:53:47,930 --> 02:53:48,370
Um...

2610
02:53:48,370 --> 02:53:52,210
Yeah, and so I was thinking recently, I was like, oh my
gosh, I'm just...

2611
02:53:52,210 --> 02:53:56,190
I've been struggling not to get one of the flip phones.

2612
02:53:59,370 --> 02:54:00,250
I was...

2613
02:54:00,250 --> 02:54:04,130
I was like, I want, like, the Z flip so bad.

2614
02:54:04,610 --> 02:54:05,810
But I don't need it!

2615
02:54:06,250 --> 02:54:26,190
So I'm been like but I want a little gadget they're so
expensive I know I know they break a lot do they I know that

2616
02:54:26,190 --> 02:54:38,090
like that I I don't need it for one and two like there's
more probably downsides than been good sides.

2617
02:54:38,470 --> 02:54:40,050
There was another phone I was looking at.

2618
02:54:40,510 --> 02:54:41,010
Um, oh my gosh.

2619
02:54:41,150 --> 02:54:41,810
What was it called?

2620
02:54:42,570 --> 02:54:50,150
Because have you guys noticed that like square phones are
kind of they're kind of like becoming more popular?

2621
02:54:51,830 --> 02:54:53,250
Oh, what was it called?

2622
02:54:59,580 --> 02:55:00,960
I can't remember.

2623
02:55:04,300 --> 02:55:11,600
I keep watching vids on 3D printing gear and I always feel
like I need this stuff and then almost never use it, yeah.

2624
02:55:14,680 --> 02:55:15,720
Square, yeah.

2625
02:55:17,180 --> 02:55:25,400
There's more flagships, more brands coming out with like,
not rectangular phones.

2626
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:30,760
Kind of like how the flip phone is when it's flipped, or not
flipped out, but like closed.

2627
02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:34,280
Yeah.

2628
02:55:35,640 --> 02:55:50,520
So, when are you starting a tech channel, I'm not a tech
person But I watched lots of tech videos In fact When I got

2629
02:55:50,520 --> 02:56:05,120
my YouTube Like my YouTube Like summary for last year That
was my That was my highest thing on my channel We're tech

2630

No way.

2632
02:56:18,020 --> 02:56:20,780
Oh my gosh, this is ridiculous.

2633
02:56:22,220 --> 02:56:23,700
Sounds like you're a tech person.

2634

one if you're hunting legends best be out there casting from

2686
03:01:59,340 --> 03:02:03,260
down to dark they show themselves certain times a day.

2687
03:02:04,720 --> 03:02:05,960
It's like I don't...

2688
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:10,400
So if they ain't biting, kick back, and have a snooze.

2689
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:15,500
Word around the lake is that big old legendary largemouth
bass has been stirring at dusk.

2690
03:02:15,540 --> 03:02:16,180
Yeah, we saw him.

2691
03:02:16,220 --> 03:02:16,700
We saw him.

2692
03:02:17,540 --> 03:02:19,080
That's all I'm spilling, friend.

2693
03:02:19,220 --> 03:02:21,840
I think maybe we need to get the next...

2694
03:02:22,360 --> 03:02:22,980
You know what?

2695
03:02:22,980 --> 03:02:23,700
I just thought about that.

2696
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:25,000
Maybe we need to get the next...

2697
03:02:25,840 --> 03:02:26,720
Probably anyway.

2698
03:02:27,520 --> 03:02:29,080
The next fishing line for him.

2699
03:02:29,940 --> 03:02:30,260
Rod.

2700
03:02:30,520 --> 03:02:31,260
The next rod.

2701
03:02:34,440 --> 03:02:43,960
the timber jack I don't know if that would make him more
interested though I guess so maybe probably okay we'll save

2702
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:44,520
for that

2703
03:02:48,500 --> 03:02:58,240
you can break your phone video addiction by falling down the
3D printer laser engraver rabbit hole I you know what has

2704
03:02:58,240 --> 03:03:05,960
stopped me from getting like a 3D printer is my inability to
model 3D stuff.

2705
03:03:06,740 --> 03:03:09,380
That's like my biggest obstacle.

2706
03:03:10,060 --> 03:03:11,540
I have to make the blender donut.

2707
03:03:12,740 --> 03:03:13,640
I have to blender...

2708
03:03:13,640 --> 03:03:15,880
Maybe I should do blender donut on stream.

2709
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:20,520
You can download 3D models.

2710
03:03:20,620 --> 03:03:22,340
I know, but the song is fine.

2711
03:03:23,940 --> 03:03:26,060
The woodworking videos.

2712
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:29,900
Yeah.

2713
03:03:30,460 --> 03:03:30,740
Yeah.

2714
03:03:31,720 --> 03:03:32,980
Blender donut.

2715
03:03:35,860 --> 03:03:36,460
Hmm.

2716
03:03:37,420 --> 03:03:37,760
Alright.

2717
03:03:38,020 --> 03:03:39,260
Let's go to the next area.

2718
03:03:39,620 --> 03:03:43,140
Since we haven't been to Golden Fork River yet.

2719
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:44,360

Oh.

2723
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:54,520
I'm pressing the wrong button.

2724
03:04:00,590 --> 03:04:00,930
Oh!

2725
03:04:01,310 --> 03:04:01,610
Wait.

2726

When I was, when I also found my essential phone and

03:06:25,080 --> 03:06:26,160
I found that too.

2743
03:06:27,140 --> 03:06:28,600
I keep all my phones.

2744
03:06:44,590 --> 03:06:45,550
HTC M8.

2745
03:06:46,090 --> 03:06:51,150
I only had HTC once and I hated it so much that it turned me
off of Android.

2746
03:06:51,290 --> 03:06:53,670
I mean, this was like, I had an HTC Vive.

2747
03:06:54,010 --> 03:06:57,650
It was, and I, I hated it, like I said, I hated it so much.

2748
03:06:57,830 --> 03:07:02,910
I never wanted a, a, like I went to iPhone.

2749
03:07:05,210 --> 03:07:07,710
Because I, I was not a fan.

2750
03:07:14,430 --> 03:07:16,230
I don't think that he's coming over here.

2751
03:07:17,970 --> 03:07:19,850
Let's try and get this big boy on the right.

2752
03:07:22,850 --> 03:07:23,390
Come on.

2753
03:07:23,630 --> 03:07:24,430
Oh, come on.

2754
03:07:24,550 --> 03:07:25,070
Turn around.

2755
03:07:25,270 --> 03:07:25,770
Turn around.

2756
03:07:26,390 --> 03:07:27,290
Turn around!

2757
03:07:28,110 --> 03:07:30,250
Okay, maybe we could do this.

2758
03:07:31,970 --> 03:07:33,630
Back in the 1700s.

2759
03:07:33,710 --> 03:07:34,530
Exactly, exactly.

2760
03:07:35,190 --> 03:07:36,050
Yeah, this guy's big.

Come on.

2764
03:07:43,550 --> 03:07:44,110
Hi, Minto.

2765
03:07:44,290 --> 03:07:44,750
Hello!

2766
03:07:49,430 --> 03:07:51,850
Apple is doo-doo, though, but not back then.

2767
03:07:52,610 --> 03:07:54,150
Back then, the Android was pretty doo-doo.

2768
03:08:02,580 --> 03:08:03,820
This area looks nice.

2769
03:08:03,960 --> 03:08:05,600
I know, it's so cool.

2770
03:08:05,820 --> 03:08:07,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, grab it, grab it.

2771
03:08:07,720 --> 03:08:10,510
Yeah, grab it.

2772
03:08:10,810 --> 03:08:11,210
Yes.

2773
03:08:12,550 --> 03:08:13,470
Yes, sir.

2774
03:08:13,470 --> 03:08:15,290
Oh, I think this is our steely head guy.

2775
03:08:19,990 --> 03:08:20,390
Whoop.

2776
03:08:21,910 --> 03:08:24,270
Right now, I'm just trying to make some cash money, baby.

2777
03:08:27,370 --> 03:08:28,170
Come on.

2778
03:08:28,930 --> 03:08:29,910
Why is my...

2779
03:08:29,910 --> 03:08:30,390
There we go.

2780
03:08:31,370 --> 03:08:34,770
Showing us all your gadgets would be a great video or even
podcast topic.

2781
03:08:37,350 --> 03:08:43,490
I can't say, I don't know, a Phoebe and Vicky are so into
gadgets as well.

2782
03:08:44,330 --> 03:08:45,510
I just like me a gadget.

2783
03:08:46,130 --> 03:08:47,070
I don't know, Vicky maybe.

2784
03:08:50,720 --> 03:08:51,620
Mental tech tips.

2785
03:08:51,740 --> 03:08:53,860
I don't want to say I'm like a professional or anything.

2786
03:08:54,320 --> 03:08:56,200
It's just a special interest, I saw.

2787
03:08:59,960 --> 03:09:00,700
Let's see.

2788
03:09:02,620 --> 03:09:03,420
Spinner bait.

2789
03:09:03,620 --> 03:09:04,360
I have that, right?

2790
03:09:05,080 --> 03:09:06,140
Sorry, I can't remember.

2791
03:09:06,280 --> 03:09:06,880
I can't.

2792
03:09:06,900 --> 03:09:07,900
Spoon bait.

2793
03:09:08,400 --> 03:09:09,540
I can't remember all these.

2794
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:10,000
Dang.

2795
03:09:12,740 --> 03:09:13,240
Names.

2796
03:09:14,240 --> 03:09:14,640
Dropshot.

2797
03:09:14,780 --> 03:09:15,860
Also for the rock bash.

2798
03:09:17,060 --> 03:09:18,650
We'll just dropshot again then.

2799
03:09:20,020 --> 03:09:20,140
Whoops.

2800
03:09:20,820 --> 03:09:21,310
There we go.

2801
03:09:26,180 --> 03:09:27,320
Ghost gotta have hobbies.

2802
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:28,660
That's the thing.

2803
03:09:28,720 --> 03:09:29,740
I have many hobbies.

2804
03:09:29,880 --> 03:09:30,320
And you know what?

2805
03:09:30,400 --> 03:09:31,760
Hobbies are so expensive.

2806
03:09:35,780 --> 03:09:36,880
Hobbies are expensive.

2807
03:09:36,900 --> 03:09:37,600
Expensive.

2808
03:09:38,800 --> 03:09:39,840
Come on, come on.

2809
03:09:40,220 --> 03:09:41,240
I know you're interested.

2810
03:09:46,410 --> 03:09:47,230
They are.

2811
03:09:48,570 --> 03:09:49,010
Yeah.

2812
03:09:50,430 --> 03:09:52,710
Especially, like, you know, I'm into idols.

2813
03:09:53,470 --> 03:09:55,390
Idols are always releasing merch.

2814
03:09:56,430 --> 03:09:59,610
I had to stop myself from getting a check-e yesterday
because I was like...

2815
03:10:00,330 --> 03:10:01,990
I would have to...

2816
03:10:03,290 --> 03:10:04,610
I would have to...

2817
03:10:06,470 --> 03:10:09,230
Like, do the shipping for just a check-e.

2818
03:10:09,610 --> 03:10:10,830
And it would be so expensive!

2819
03:10:11,930 --> 03:10:13,650
Yeah, instruments are very expensive.

2820
03:10:14,190 --> 03:10:15,690
Yeah, instruments are so expensive.

2821
03:10:16,110 --> 03:10:17,030
Did you have a Kindle?

2822
03:10:17,190 --> 03:10:19,170
No, actually, I did not have a Kindle.

2823
03:10:20,930 --> 03:10:23,450
Wait, I thought I had the right guy.

2824
03:10:24,430 --> 03:10:25,250
What am I looking for?

2825
03:10:26,490 --> 03:10:27,370
Rock Bash.

2826
03:10:28,110 --> 03:10:29,930
I was looking at the wrong guy, my bad.

2827
03:10:32,650 --> 03:10:33,450
Please move.

2828
03:10:46,940 --> 03:10:48,460
Developing an idle phone.

2829
03:10:50,060 --> 03:10:50,820
yeah

2830
03:10:56,020 --> 03:11:13,300
easy I think Pokemon card collecting is a good example of an
expensive hobby nowadays Pokemon card collecting is crazy

2831
03:11:13,300 --> 03:11:25,220
there's nothing worse than when a hobby that's one thing
some hobbies never will get uh targeted by scalpers but when

2832
03:11:25,220 --> 03:11:31,660
a hobby does get targeted by scalpers it's just so oh it's
so disheartening

2833
03:11:38,860 --> 03:11:51,500
archery is surprisingly expensive too I think I mean certain
sports yeah will probably be pretty expensive come on come

2834
03:11:51,500 --> 03:11:55,800
on the triple the triple dipper yes

2835
03:11:59,560 --> 03:12:09,040
I blame Jake Paul I think it is his fault though I think it
is like actually a good portion of him is the reason why the

2836
03:12:09,040 --> 03:12:11,960
Pokemon card thing exploded the way it did

2837
03:12:15,680 --> 03:12:23,880

The steel head.

2866
03:15:24,550 --> 03:15:26,470
Works for anything if you believe.

2867
03:15:27,930 --> 03:15:29,370
Anything can be spspsps.

2868
03:15:30,430 --> 03:15:31,750
Wait, I think I need to throw.

2869
03:15:40,650 --> 03:15:41,770

03:15:44,450 --> 03:15:46,290
What's the other guy I'm trying to fish for?

2871
03:15:47,870 --> 03:15:50,330

You feel like you have the need to hold your breath?

2874
03:15:56,790 --> 03:15:58,230
I feel like I'm under the water.

2875
03:15:58,550 --> 03:16:00,450
And I feel like I need to hold my breath.

2876
03:16:05,470 --> 03:16:06,410
Is it just me?

2877
03:16:06,430 --> 03:16:09,090

I had!

2887
03:16:50,610 --> 03:16:52,330
What were they fishing for?

2888
03:16:54,870 --> 03:16:55,670
The chub.

2889
03:16:58,410 --> 03:16:59,630
Wait, where'd they go?

2890
03:17:00,290 --> 03:17:00,850
Where'd they go?

2891
03:17:01,290 --> 03:17:01,770
Wait, wait, wait.

2892
03:17:01,910 --> 03:17:02,410

Wait, they're right there!

2894
03:17:03,310 --> 03:17:03,870
Oh my gosh.

2895
03:17:04,790 --> 03:17:05,330
They're finicky.

2896
03:17:12,620 --> 03:17:14,300
I did equip the new thing, right?

2897
03:17:15,200 --> 03:17:16,120
The new lure.

2898
03:17:24,780 --> 03:17:27,180
They're not interested even a little bit.

2899
03:17:28,740 --> 03:17:30,960
Shaking the Metal Gear bag loudly like dog food.

2900
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:33,920
Yeah, that'll work.

2901
03:17:34,140 --> 03:17:35,080
That will actually work.

2902
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:40,840
Oh, wait.

2903
03:17:41,440 --> 03:17:42,480
Turn around, please.

2904
03:17:43,720 --> 03:17:44,400
Thank you.

Come on!

2914
03:18:44,860 --> 03:18:46,740
My dog is the same way.

03:18:48,460 --> 03:18:49,180
Chudu?

2916
03:18:49,540 --> 03:18:52,560
Oh, my cats go insane over the chudu.

2917
03:18:53,060 --> 03:18:56,660
I mean, I think any cat would go insane over the chudu.

2918
03:18:57,460 --> 03:18:57,920
Yay!

2919
03:18:58,200 --> 03:18:59,160

Teeny tiny baby.

2928
03:19:55,820 --> 03:19:56,360
All right.

2929
03:19:57,100 --> 03:19:59,380
Why, though, some of these, like...

2930
03:19:59,380 --> 03:20:02,120
You see how there's X's and then there's the slashes?

2931
03:20:03,920 --> 03:20:05,380
I wonder what that means.

2932
03:20:21,190 --> 03:20:21,710
Hmm.

2933
03:20:22,650 --> 03:20:25,610
It means all sizes.

2934
03:20:26,330 --> 03:20:28,390
So if I get an X, that means I caught both sizes.

2935
03:20:28,850 --> 03:20:30,650
Ah, I see.

2936
03:20:32,330 --> 03:20:33,050
Oh my god.

2937
03:20:33,170 --> 03:20:33,670
Holy!

2938
03:20:34,950 --> 03:20:37,490
I guess he's our legend.

2939
03:20:39,090 --> 03:20:39,430
Maybe.

2940
03:20:42,230 --> 03:20:42,570
Ah.

2941
03:20:43,390 --> 03:20:46,590
I see, I see, I see.

2942
03:20:50,920 --> 03:20:52,660
He's so small.

2943
03:20:57,270 --> 03:20:59,810
Wait, um, it's the drop shot, right?

2944
03:21:01,490 --> 03:21:02,370
I think.

2945
03:21:02,770 --> 03:21:04,570
No, well, thank you so much for that one, I kept it.

2946
03:21:06,140 --> 03:21:06,760
Thank you!

2947

Spoon bait.

2949
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:12,360
Spoon.

2950
03:21:14,600 --> 03:21:16,120
We'll try to have a spoon bait.

2951
03:21:17,820 --> 03:21:19,560
So we can try and get a big boy.

2952
03:21:22,700 --> 03:21:22,960
Ha!

2953
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:28,700
How long have I been playing this game for?

2954
03:21:29,180 --> 03:21:30,940
Oh, three and a half hours?

2955
03:21:33,180 --> 03:21:33,640
Cool.

2956
03:21:43,340 --> 03:21:47,720
I'm telling you, it's these the fishing games, they really
get me.

2957
03:21:54,180 --> 03:21:54,880
Let's see, though.

2958
03:21:55,060 --> 03:21:57,460
Let's try and go back to see if we can get to the next area.

2959
03:21:59,240 --> 03:22:00,940
We'll just try to discover a bunch of areas.

2960
03:22:04,440 --> 03:22:06,240
Minto fishing yapping flow state.

2961
03:22:09,400 --> 03:22:10,720
We love fishing.

2962
03:22:11,520 --> 03:22:13,700
No, we could get the next rod!

2963
03:22:15,360 --> 03:22:18,180
That cooler better be heavy or we're fine.

2964
03:22:20,960 --> 03:22:21,440
Gimme!

2965
03:22:22,380 --> 03:22:23,320
Ah yeah!

2966
03:22:23,740 --> 03:22:24,680
Timber Jack!

2967
03:22:25,160 --> 03:22:25,980
Let's go!

2968
03:22:27,380 --> 03:22:28,220
You have something to say?

2969
03:22:28,700 --> 03:22:29,400
Thanks, bud.

2970
03:22:30,300 --> 03:22:32,400
Thanks for playing this and showing us your fishing prowess.

2971
03:22:32,540 --> 03:22:33,120
Of course!

2972
03:22:34,060 --> 03:22:35,680
Halled in a big steelhead, did you?

2973
03:22:36,040 --> 03:22:38,540
Thing must have fought like a wolverine on a bad day.

2974
03:22:39,400 --> 03:22:40,660
Got this new rod in, too.

2975
03:22:41,120 --> 03:22:42,700
Good for hauling more like it.

2976
03:22:42,960 --> 03:22:44,280
The freshwater kind, anyway.

2977
03:22:44,500 --> 03:22:46,280
Or chucking bait out way deep.

2978
03:22:47,460 --> 03:22:47,780
More?

2979
03:22:48,860 --> 03:22:50,820
Oh, blue baitcaster.

2980
03:22:52,880 --> 03:22:54,480
Wow, she's a beaut.

2981
03:22:55,980 --> 03:22:57,400
Wait, so it also...

2982
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:01,780
Wow, what's the difference between, like, a mono and a
braid?

2983
03:23:06,500 --> 03:23:11,900
I guess this one would be better with the upgrades, because
this one is...

2984
03:23:12,400 --> 03:23:13,480
Oh, okay, okay.

2985
03:23:16,040 --> 03:23:17,040
Tougher line.

2986
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:19,680
Oh, I get it, I get it.

2987
03:23:19,760 --> 03:23:23,360
Okay, so it's like single string versus like braided string.

2988
03:23:24,380 --> 03:23:27,840
Oh, interesting, interesting, interesting.

2989
03:23:28,920 --> 03:23:30,920
I'm actually learning about fishing.

2990
03:23:31,060 --> 03:23:31,760
This is crazy.

2991
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:34,300
That's so fun.

2992
03:23:34,500 --> 03:23:35,640
Wait, this is so awesome.

2993
03:23:38,740 --> 03:23:40,560
Wait, this is so fun.

2994
03:23:46,780 --> 03:23:47,420
Okay.

2995
03:23:48,880 --> 03:23:57,480
I do have this game on my list of like you know when I'm
when I travel to have this game to play this game you know

2996
03:23:57,480 --> 03:24:06,340
what I mean while I'm out and about so it might be like kind
of a I don't play it for a while but it's probably because

2997
03:24:06,340 --> 03:24:16,000
I'm saving it for when I'm like on my travel setup you know
what I mean this game gets a lot of things right you could

2998
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:22,140
tell that like the who made it like knew their stuff which
is really fun yeah

2999
03:24:29,870 --> 03:24:39,630
gaming abroad first stream i've caught and i love that this
is the chilly chilly sea up and fish stream thank you thanks

3000
03:24:39,630 --> 03:24:43,150
for sticking around i'm glad you liked it thank you thank
you thank you

3001
03:24:46,310 --> 03:24:51,810
you can tell that the person who made it is a fish Yeah.

3002
03:24:52,950 --> 03:24:56,850
This is, but then I feel like they would punish you for
fishing.

3003
03:24:58,510 --> 03:25:01,990
This is, this is, it would be, because this is like fishing
propaganda.

3004
03:25:02,310 --> 03:25:06,630
They would be like, no, we have to make it where you go
fishing and bad things happen.

3005
03:25:07,810 --> 03:25:10,790
Just notice the scene page has an Asian themed DLC for June.

3006
03:25:11,230 --> 03:25:12,230
Hope it gives you a game.

3007
03:25:12,810 --> 03:25:14,410
Wait, hope you give a game.

3008
03:25:15,590 --> 03:25:17,950
Hope you give the game another shot when it comes out.

3009
03:25:18,090 --> 03:25:19,510
Wait, oh it's not out yet.

3010
03:25:20,250 --> 03:25:26,950
saw that too but the there's the supporter pack which gives
you more animals

3011
03:25:30,900 --> 03:25:31,820

3012
03:25:38,410 --> 03:25:45,510

consistent updates which is really cool like they did a

3014
03:25:51,690 --> 03:25:59,970
winter update and they did like the fall update and oh yeah
I see it Eastern winds.

3015
03:26:00,810 --> 03:26:00,910
Wow!

3016
03:26:01,550 --> 03:26:02,930
Wait, it's not out yet?

3017
03:26:06,160 --> 03:26:08,080
Oh yeah, June 20, 26.

3018
03:26:10,560 --> 03:26:11,140
Good day, Minto.

3019
03:26:11,340 --> 03:26:13,100
I passed JLPT N3 today.

3020
03:26:14,200 --> 03:26:14,760
Ombedito!

3021
03:26:16,760 --> 03:26:18,140
Oh my gosh.

3022
03:26:18,360 --> 03:26:18,920
Congratulations!

3023
03:26:20,120 --> 03:26:20,620
I...

3024
03:26:20,620 --> 03:26:22,080
JLPT stresses me out.

3025
03:26:22,200 --> 03:26:23,340
I'm not like a test taker.

3026
03:26:25,460 --> 03:26:27,340
I'm not the test taker type.

3027
03:26:27,400 --> 03:26:28,020
It'll scare me.

3028
03:26:30,620 --> 03:26:31,340
Congrats!

3029
03:26:31,880 --> 03:26:32,680
That's so awesome!

3030
03:26:33,200 --> 03:26:34,300
That's so awesome!

3031
03:26:38,220 --> 03:26:38,940
Yeah.

3032
03:26:42,320 --> 03:26:43,920
What level do I think of it?

3033
03:26:44,100 --> 03:26:44,980
Oh, sorry.

3034
03:26:45,840 --> 03:26:47,340
Probably around N3.

3035
03:26:48,620 --> 03:26:51,420
I'm just conversational enough to get me around.

3036
03:26:51,500 --> 03:26:54,440
The N3 to N2 hurdle is like...

3037
03:26:54,440 --> 03:26:55,720
It's really hard.

3038
03:27:03,750 --> 03:27:15,070
because especially like you know when you learn a language
and you are able to be conversational then you're like oh

3039
03:27:15,070 --> 03:27:22,870
well I don't need to it's it's hard to one like find the
motivation to at least for me to find the motivation to keep

3040
03:27:22,870 --> 03:27:33,750
pushing and then also like it's it the the the especially
especially if we're like Japanese when you go from like you

3041
03:27:33,750 --> 03:27:45,990
know normal keigo normal like uh polite speech to like ultra
polite speech and you're like oh man it's like such a the n3

3042
03:27:45,990 --> 03:27:48,110
to n2 is like crazy

3043
03:27:52,170 --> 03:28:00,470
it's like a huge huge difficulty spike hyper formal yeah

3044
03:28:03,550 --> 03:28:10,290
It's like just keigo, like, you know, you have like, you
have casual, basic, and keigo.

3045
03:28:10,610 --> 03:28:12,290
No, there's like layers of keigo.

3046
03:28:13,810 --> 03:28:18,030
There's like, there's like at least five ways to say one
thing.

3047
03:28:18,230 --> 03:28:20,170
So it's just like, oh my God.

3048
03:28:21,390 --> 03:28:21,870
Kanji.

3049
03:28:22,150 --> 03:28:23,330
Yeah, kanji is.

3050
03:28:24,510 --> 03:28:26,430
Yeah, English doesn't have polite speak.

3051
03:28:26,630 --> 03:28:27,070
Exactly.

3052
03:28:27,610 --> 03:28:30,630
I mean, it does, but it doesn't at the same time, you know,
like.

3053
03:28:33,550 --> 03:28:38,410
People, if you're too polite, even in a business situation,
people think you're being kind of weird.

3054
03:28:39,390 --> 03:28:43,270
So it's like, when do we even use the ultra polite speak
anymore?

3055
03:28:45,110 --> 03:28:48,790
Like, people are going to be like, yo, you're too uptight.

3056
03:28:48,930 --> 03:28:49,230
Come on.

3057
03:28:49,790 --> 03:28:51,030
We're just having a business meeting.

3058
03:28:51,250 --> 03:28:51,610
We're chill.

3059
03:28:56,310 --> 03:28:57,150
In emails.

3060
03:28:59,110 --> 03:29:00,530
We just have sir and madam.

3061
03:29:00,990 --> 03:29:01,530
Oh, ma'am.

3062
03:29:03,550 --> 03:29:04,330
official document.

3063
03:29:04,490 --> 03:29:05,690
I guess that's true, yeah.

3064
03:29:14,030 --> 03:29:14,530
But yeah.

3065
03:29:14,950 --> 03:29:15,450
Keep, keep.

3066
03:29:15,650 --> 03:29:17,190
It's just like anything, though, guys.

3067
03:29:17,310 --> 03:29:19,010
You just got to keep, keep at it.

3068
03:29:19,810 --> 03:29:21,270
I just got to keep, keep at it.

3069
03:29:24,870 --> 03:29:27,250
Sir, please stop padding out your sentence.

3070
03:29:27,450 --> 03:29:28,050
Oh, I'm so sorry.

3071
03:29:28,110 --> 03:29:31,630
I have a word count, a minimum word count that I need for
this essay.

3072
03:29:32,490 --> 03:29:32,890
So...

3073
03:29:35,070 --> 03:29:40,270
Yes, I will say the thing that I need to say in the longest
way that I can possibly say it.

3074
03:29:45,930 --> 03:29:46,370
Saita!

3075
03:29:46,370 --> 03:29:46,790
No!

3076
03:29:50,250 --> 03:29:51,970
It is, but you can do it.

3077
03:29:55,860 --> 03:29:58,180
I think I will end it here, though, guys.

3078
03:29:59,200 --> 03:29:59,640
Sorry.

3079
03:30:00,040 --> 03:30:01,560
I got sleepy all sudden.

3080
03:30:02,540 --> 03:30:03,740
I think I will call it...

3081
03:30:03,740 --> 03:30:07,680
Wait, no, before we call it here, We got that big...

3082
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:12,120
We got that big, that big one.

3083
03:30:12,620 --> 03:30:14,000
Let's try it on this guy.

3084
03:30:17,500 --> 03:30:18,880
I just want to see if he bites.

3085
03:30:20,340 --> 03:30:21,440
I just want to see if he bites.

3086
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:25,380
Have a good... Oh, okay.

3087
03:30:26,280 --> 03:30:26,700
Sorry.

3088
03:30:35,450 --> 03:30:36,410
Switch to...

3089
03:30:37,250 --> 03:30:37,730
Timberjack.

3090
03:30:38,970 --> 03:30:39,970
And then it was...

3091
03:30:41,930 --> 03:30:44,990
I think it was just a brown trout, so crankbait.

3092
03:30:49,380 --> 03:30:51,140
Big, big crankbait.

3093
03:30:52,700 --> 03:30:52,940
Yeah.

3094
03:30:55,600 --> 03:30:56,120
Whip.

3095
03:30:56,580 --> 03:30:56,760
Ha!

3096
03:30:59,260 --> 03:31:00,620
La la la la la.

3097
03:31:00,980 --> 03:31:03,860
Sinking to the bottom of the lake.

3098
03:31:04,200 --> 03:31:04,460
Nope.

3099
03:31:06,280 --> 03:31:07,940
I'm not far enough.

3100
03:31:08,980 --> 03:31:09,960
Keep it going.

3101
03:31:10,140 --> 03:31:11,280
Oh my gosh, there's a beaver right next.

3102
03:31:11,300 --> 03:31:12,100
to me.

3103
03:31:12,920 --> 03:31:14,080
I'm like snow white.

3104
03:31:14,380 --> 03:31:15,620
These animals have no fear.

3105
03:31:18,420 --> 03:31:18,680
Okay.

3106
03:31:19,120 --> 03:31:19,540
Like here?

3107
03:31:23,080 --> 03:31:23,320
Ah!

3108
03:31:25,580 --> 03:31:26,260
Yeah.

3109
03:31:26,660 --> 03:31:27,340
Unless it's...

3110
03:31:27,340 --> 03:31:28,660
Unless we have to do dusk.

3111
03:31:28,800 --> 03:31:29,320
Unless he's not.

3112
03:31:29,900 --> 03:31:29,900
Oh,

3113
03:31:40,440 --> 03:31:42,920
I think I lost him.

3114
03:31:45,620 --> 03:31:46,420
I lost him.

3115
03:31:47,100 --> 03:31:47,460
Oh!

3116
03:31:48,060 --> 03:31:49,340
He grabbed!

3117
03:31:49,500 --> 03:31:50,280
He grabbed!

3118
03:31:50,480 --> 03:31:51,000
He grabbed!

3119
03:31:51,020 --> 03:31:56,160
It was our fishing rod.

3120
03:31:56,940 --> 03:31:59,100
Ha ha ha ha.

3121
03:31:59,500 --> 03:32:00,960
