00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
Hello.

2
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,860
Hi.

3
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,380
Do you like my getup?

4
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,430
Hello.

5
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,830
Welcome.

6
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:09,910
Hi.

7
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,450
Hold on, let me drink some water.

8
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,920
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

9
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,460
I feel bad.

10
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:43,640
That... I feel... Maybe... I feel like a... Like... Like... Like... I was gone for a week and then... And then... I put this up.

11
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,740
I feel bad.

12
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
Don't... Don't... Don't... Uh... How do I say?

13
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,620
Um... I try... I was like... Oh, I'll just say it like it's a... Like it's a yapping stream.

14
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,660
It's no big deal.

15
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,700
But... I accidentally...

16
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,540
I think... Made some of you guys worry.

17
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,140
I'm sorry.

18
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,400
Oh, I accidentally made some of you guys feel bad.

19
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,860
And then I felt like... I was like... Oh, gosh.

20
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,240
There's so many people...

21
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,880
Waiting.

22
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,660
I think... Maybe people... Are expecting something big.

23
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,680
But it's not really.

24
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,460
I think maybe I... Accidentally... I'm like... What's the Streisand effect?

25
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,060
Or whatever.

26
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,100
Or... My own... Dingy.

27
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,880
Rechat was funny because of it.

28
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,580
Clickbait!

29
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,840
Well, not really.

30
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,120
It's still... Something I want to talk about.

31
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,400
I don't know.

32
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:36,740
I don't know.

33
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,060
But... Also... You guys are so...

34
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,880
Some of you guys are so...

35
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,280
You guys are going to have more faith in...

36
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,780
In... In your Oshis.

37
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,420
I think.

38
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,740
I don't think your Oshis would put like...

39
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,980
Oh, you're a small yap.

40
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,720
If they were going to...

41
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,740
Announce their graduation.

42
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,280
That would be so mean.

43
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,880
That would be so mean.

44
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,280
Thank you guys though for all the...

45
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
Gifted memberships and the Super Charts.

46
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,080
Thank you.

47
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,100
I was... I was gone for a week.

48
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,560
Which is not even that long of a time.

49
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,860
But it felt like a long time.

50
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,840
For me.

51
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,740
It always feels like a long time for me.

52
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,100
But...

53
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,960
Small yap.

54
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm leaving forever.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,300
Good boy.

56
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,200
Good boy.

57
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,980
You guys can probably already tell though...

58
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,140
What I'm going to talk about.

59
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,700
You can probably already tell.

60
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
I feel...

61
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,480
Yeah.

62
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
I have no idea.

63
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,740
That's okay.

64
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,940
God's sickest ghost.

65
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,720
How is it that I'm dead?

66
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,960
And yet...

67
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,440
And yet...

68
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,380
Kiwawa!

69
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,240
You preggle.

70
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,320
With you?

71
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,960
From last time?

72
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,860
I thought we were safe.

73
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,340
I thought we were safe.

74
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,940
Hold on.

75
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,600
Where...

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,320
Where'd she go?

77
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,490
You and Doki had fun on your honeymoon?

78
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,410
Oh yeah.

79
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,790
Doki was gone too, huh?

80
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,590
You couldn't hear my voice is a little bit.

81
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,170
And so it's going to be a bit of a shorter stream today.

82
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,330
That's why it's a short yap.

83
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,770
And then I'll talk about stuff for the next couple of months.

84
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,630
I think...

85
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,630
Not that...

86
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,190
No, I think.

87
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,770
I know.

88
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,330
Um...

89
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,160
It didn't get better.

90
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Actually, it got...

91
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,020
It got worse.

92
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,920
I didn't even do anything.

93
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,300
I...

94
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,680
I...

95
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,000
I didn't even like...

96
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,740
Like I just...

97
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,720
It just...

98
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
I didn't even do anything.

99
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,540
It got worse.

100
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,660
And it's bad.

101
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,480
Because I have so many deadlines this week.

102
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,460
But...

103
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,620
But...

104
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,080
Um...

105
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,180
Yeah.

106
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,380
So for those who...

107
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,660
I was just going to talk about it, I guess.

108
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,000
For those who...

109
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,160
Um...

110
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,980
Probably...

111
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,380
No.

112
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,320
The past couple of months, I've been having some really bad struggles with my...

113
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,080
Um...

114
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,960
With my throat.

115
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,780
And my throat doesn't hurt.

116
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,720
So...

117
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,260
It's not anything like that.

118
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,380
If you're over just like...

119
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,740
Oh my god.

120
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,540
She's in pain.

121
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,580
No, no.

122
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,800
It's nothing like that.

123
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,180
Um...

124
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,120
And...

125
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,400
Uh...

126
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,600
Uh...

127
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,440
Which is kind of bad.

128
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,820
Because like...

129
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,780
My...

130
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,520
My job is talking.

131
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,160
And...

132
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,720
Yeah.

133
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,960
Less yelling at idols.

134
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,580
Even at idol lives.

135
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,420
I haven't even been doing calls.

136
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,100
Which is...

137
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,000
I haven't been doing anything like that.

138
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,200
It's...

139
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,800
It's true.

140
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,440
It's true.

141
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:48,960
It's true.

142
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,220
When I go to an idol live...

143
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,020
If there's calls, I like...

144
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,600
I like just mouth it.

145
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,340
I like just mouth it.

146
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,980
But uh...

147
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,900
But...

148
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,380
Um...

149
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,460
Say it ain't so.

150
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,220
It's because I've been trying to...

151
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,960
Make sure my voice is okay.

152
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,460
And it started...

153
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,360
Last year.

154
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,160
It started last year when I...

155
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,180
Got COVID.

156
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,080
Thanks, Mataracon.

157
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,480
And then...

158
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,700
Um...

159
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,220
And then I got...

160
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,960
Punkitis...

161
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,040
Earlier this year.

162
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,640
Where I completely lost my voice.

163
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,200
And...

164
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,680
I think that was kind of like...

165
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,780
The nail in the coffin.

166
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,200
And I've...

167
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,100
And I was like...

168
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,820
Looking it up.

169
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,080
And people are like...

170
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,340
Yeah, you really should like...

171
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,500
Let your voice rest for like...

172
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,700
Three months.

173
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,080
Don't do anything.

174
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,240
And I was like...

175
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,580
So...

176
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,520
The nail in the coffin.

177
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,800
You and Henya have had bad luck.

178
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,360
I know.

179
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,520
With that...

180
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,240
Yeah, I've heard too.

181
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,700
Because I asked her if...

182
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,300
Um...

183
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,820
I asked her about something too.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,480
And she wasn't able to...

185
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,340
Do it.

186
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,160
Because she's like...

187
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,680
I can't.

188
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,640
Because of COVID.

189
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,880
Um...

190
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,720
But, you know...

191
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,500
Everybody's been kind of like...

192
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,620
Well...

193
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,460
You know...

194
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,740
Hope you've been feeling better...

195
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Since you took the week off.

196
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,360
And...

197
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,100
Honestly...

198
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,560
Oh my gosh.

199
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,720
Thank you guys...

200
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,500
For letting me...

201
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,520
Take those days off too.

202
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,300
Because...

203
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,300
It was...

204
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,220
So...

205
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,440
So...

206
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,580
So needed.

207
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,220
Oh my gosh.

208
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,380
It was so, so...

209
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,460
So, so needed.

210
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,000
So, um...

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,620
I was able to at least...

212
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,980
Get the things...

213
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,960
Done that I needed to.

214
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,760
It was really, really, really, really good.

215
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,400
So thank you.

216
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,100
Oh my gosh.

217
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,700
It was good, good, good.

218
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,200
It was good, good, good.

219
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,660
Um...

220
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,500
And, you know...

221
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,800
So I wish I had like...

222
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,220
Better news.

223
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,160
I wish I could be like...

224
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,300
Yep!

225
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,680
I'm cured forever.

226
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,360
But, uh...

227
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,320
Yeah, I just haven't really given my voice...

228
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,080
I think the chance to recover...

229
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,100
Since January.

230
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,800
And I'm also...

231
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,060
I'm also on a new...

232
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,040
Medicine I've told you guys about before.

233
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,660
And it, like...

234
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,560
Kind of...

235
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,620
Makes my throat really dry.

236
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,260
And that's also not helping.

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,620
So...

238
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,920
Mmm...

239
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,540
Um...

240
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,660
It's been...

241
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,300
Tough.

242
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,600
I...

243
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,300
Go drink water.

244
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,560
I drink so much water.

245
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,660
You guys don't understand...

246
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,040
How much water I have.

247
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,820
How many cough drops I'm drinking.

248
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,800
Or...

249
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,880
Sucking on.

250
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,220
How much...

251
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,740
Those...

252
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,320
Those...

253
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,960
Those like...

254
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,200
Herbal...

255
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Herbal...

256
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,020
Things...

257
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,680
For your throat.

258
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,080
I...

259
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,860
I do it all.

260
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,320
Like...

261
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,840
All day.

262
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,060
If there's something that you're telling me to do...

263
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,340
I'm already doing it.

264
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:43,840
So...

265
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,580
You don't even need to say anything.

266
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,860
You don't even need to say anything.

267
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,280
Um...

268
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,540
I'm already doing it.

269
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,580
Um...

270
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,380
Voodoo.

271
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,720
I'm not doing that.

272
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,040
Maybe I should be doing voodoo.

273
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,390
But, um...

274
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,910
Have you consulted a specialist?

275
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,070
I...

276
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,150
I tried to.

277
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,910
I don't think I'll be able to go until after Japan.

278
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,630
Because...

279
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,210
I tried to make an appointment.

280
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,990
And it referred me back to my...

281
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,610
General doctor.

282
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:26,990
And...

283
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,790
So I think I have to get like a...

284
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,550
Referral...

285
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,350
Um...

286
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,550
To do it.

287
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,570
So...

288
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,030
And I don't know then...

289
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,610
After then...

290
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,770
When I'd be able to get an appointment.

291
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:40,950
So...

292
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,350
Yeah...

293
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,690
Um...

294
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,970
I did try.

295
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,030
I did try.

296
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:48,930
Uh...

297
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,170
But, uh...

298
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,600
So...

299
00:12:59,600 --> 00:12:59,890
Uh...

300
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,400
Yeah...

301
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know.

302
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,040
I'm trying not to like get upset about it.

303
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,900
Right now.

304
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm upset about it, obviously.

305
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,260
Uh...

306
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,760
Because right now...

307
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,560
I have so many things...

308
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,720
Piling up.

309
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,960
And I'm like getting offers for things.

310
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,580
And the one thing that I need to work isn't.

311
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,640
Uh...

312
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,720
Um...

313
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,880
I don't want to just complain.

314
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,320
Sorry.

315
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,640
Japan's doctor.

316
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,280
Guys, I have no time during my Japan trip.

317
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,160
I have zero time.

318
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,140
During my Japan trip.

319
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,420
I...

320
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,620
I am busy, busy, busy.

321
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,400
It's a super duper busy...

322
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,740
Trip for me.

323
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,400
So...

324
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,040
Not this time.

325
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,840
There's no way.

326
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:56,960
Uh...

327
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,760
But...

328
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,540
Uh...

329
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,140
Yeah...

330
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:00,800
I don't know.

331
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,900
I've just been really like...

332
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,700
For the past couple months.

333
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,940
So...

334
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,620
Frustrated.

335
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,420
Obviously.

336
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,120
I've...

337
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,500
I've expressed that.

338
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,200
Probably...

339
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,880
Countless.

340
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,280
Less times.

341
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,520
But...

342
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,920
So...

343
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,480
Because of that.

344
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,600
Um...

345
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,380
I...

346
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm not...

347
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,240
Taking a break.

348
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,980
Per se.

349
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,280
But...

350
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,340
Definitely...

351
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,740
For the next...

352
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,560
Couple of months.

353
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,400
I'd say about three months or so.

354
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,880
That's when people say that...

355
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,000
Uh...

356
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,480
That's when...

357
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,400
They say like...

358
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,720
That's a good amount of time.

359
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Uh...

360
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,400
So...

361
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,260
I'll be doing...

362
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,680
Less streams...

363
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,840
For the next...

364
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,260
Three months or so.

365
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,700
And...

366
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,480
Uh...

367
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,360
And...

368
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,520
Uh...

369
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,280
Probably like...

370
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,700
Reducing to like...

371
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,360
Three...

372
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,600
Streams...

373
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,960
Times a week or so.

374
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,020
Um...

375
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,840
Many, many less.

376
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,500
And then...

377
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,920
Probably...

378
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,480
Also...

379
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,300
Uh...

380
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,560
Probably no schedules...

381
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,160
For the next three months.

382
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,080
Because...

383
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,040
It will kind of be like...

384
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,740
If my...

385
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,900
Voice is feeling okay that day.

386
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,100
Or not.

387
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,400
So...

388
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,640
Uh...

389
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:29,960
Sorry.

390
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,200
I know some people are just like...

391
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,360
They really like schedules.

392
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,280
But after...

393
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,940
After...

394
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,420
So...

395
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,060
I'd say...

396
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,260
It's not...

397
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,080
It's almost May.

398
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,220
So June, July, August.

399
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,280
End of August.

400
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,420
Into September.

401
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,960
Into September.

402
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,380
We...

403
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,980
We...

404
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,260
We can...

405
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,200
We will...

406
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,120
Resume the schedules.

407
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,580
So it's only...

408
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,180
Temporary.

409
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,780
And...

410
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,760
Uh...

411
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,520
Um...

412
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,740
But I will give a...

413
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,140
Heads up.

414
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,020
Like I'll make the waiting room.

415
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,080
I'll make the waiting room early.

416
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,820
And like announce on...

417
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,020
Twitter.

418
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,660
And stuff.

419
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,280
With...

420
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,980
Time in advance.

421
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,220
Unless it's like...

422
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,320
Me being like...

423
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,280
I'm gonna play Oblivion.

424
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,240
Unless I'm like...

425
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,980
I wanna play Oblivion today.

426
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,600
But...

427
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,120
Uh...

428
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,400
Yeah.

429
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,850
So I'm sorry...

430
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,250
That you'll probably be seeing...

431
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,270
Less of me a little bit.

432
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,910
Uh...

433
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,310
I'm only gonna do...

434
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,430
Three streams this week.

435
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,650
Well actually...

436
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,730
I'm doing a collab with...

437
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,330
Coyote.

438
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,450
From Kimono Friends.

439
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,390
Um...

440
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:44,450
Um...

441
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,190
She wanted to do...

442
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,250
If you didn't see...

443
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,670
Uh...

444
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,130
Uh...

445
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,910
I will be...

446
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,450
Appearing in her graduation live.

447
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,170
So...

448
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,610
Um...

449
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,450
And it's 3D.

450
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,130
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm...

451
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,910
And...

452
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,790
So that's one of the dances I've been...

453
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,950
Practicing a lot.

454
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,190
But...

455
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,030
Even though it's mostly us...

456
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,210
Just being silly goofy.

457
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,410
But yeah.

458
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,910
So...

459
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:10,990
Um...

460
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,690
Mm-mm-mm-mm...

461
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,230
Um...

462
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,830
So yeah.

463
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,790
That will be it.

464
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:23,990
Next week?

465
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,690
One of the reasons I'm in Japan.

466
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,410
Thank you guys, thank you.

467
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,450
Thank you, thank you.

468
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,720
Silent streams.

469
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
I don't know if it's even possible for me.

470
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,820
I guess I could try.

471
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,320
Maybe, like, just play Oblivion in no voice.

472
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
Why do I keep... Everything goes back to Oblivion.

473
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,100
I've been wanting to play it so much.

474
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,720
Text-to-speech?

475
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,210
Then I would have to type.

476
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,150
How do you game?

477
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,570
If you have to type.

478
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,650
How do you game and type?

479
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,810
What if it's like...

480
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,630
What's the word?

481
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,170
Typing of the dead.

482
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,410
Two keyboards.

483
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,390
Yeah, right?

484
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,230
Just type faster.

485
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,850
You'll get me crashing out, but in text-to-speech.

486
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,570
I would be so stupid.

487
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,850
The text-to-speech crash out.

488
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,970
Yeah, I could use my toes.

489
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,170
So true.

490
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,350
So, so true.

491
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,470
With lots of typos.

492
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,130
Oh my gosh.

493
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,710
It would...

494
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,250
There will be...

495
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:13,550
Hold on.

496
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,710
Let's save and just try.

497
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,570
Text-to-speech.

498
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,270
With realistic AI voices.

499
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,290
Oh, I'm gonna go with Atom.

500
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,930
Newton's first law of motion.

501
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,650
Oh, I'm just scared.

502
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,070
Also known as...

503
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,510
Shut up.

504
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,650
Does this count as commercial use?

505
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,770
Everybody, don't send me any donos.

506
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,970
Don't send me any money right now.

507
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,790
Drag and drop your phone.

508
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:57,970
Oh.

509
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:58,910
Hold on.

510
00:19:59,130 --> 00:19:59,450
Let's see.

511
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,270
Hello, my name is Mint Phantom.

512
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,370
Wow, that was pretty good.

513
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,270
Hello, my name is Mint Phantom.

514
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,190
That was pretty good.

515
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,630
Wait, how does he laugh?

516
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,670
Let's see how he laughs.

517
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,830
Because he got that minky flair.

518
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,970
No, I typed it way more than that.

519
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,140
There we go.

520
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,500
Oh, yeah.

521
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,180
Let's do it.

522
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,420
Okay, that's here.

523
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,040
Wait, what?

524
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,580
Oh, here we go.

525
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,740
Hahaha.

526
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,060
Jinzu-faya-fibo, weepa-tiga-tiga-tada-tada-tiga.

527
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,100
Chape-ape-care-a-kina-chape-ape-care-a-kina.

528
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,740
Myo-hantusook, weepa.

529
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,760
Oi!

530
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:14,200
Waka-e-ri-na-sai-mase, gosho-jin-sawa, ojyo-sama.

531
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,540
Okura-nasai-maze.

532
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,880
Gashi-jin-sama, ojyo-sama.

533
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,240
Hahaha.

534
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:22,880
Hahaha.

535
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,420
Okura-nasai-maze.

536
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,120
Hahaha.

537
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,260
I didn't know text-to-speech could be cringe.

538
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,760
I don't know, guys.

539
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,980
It does sound like he's saying it with like a southern accent.

540
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,060
Hahaha.

541
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,720
Wait, let's hear him say hot dog.

542
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,400
Hot dog.

543
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,140
Hot dog!

544
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,200
Hahaha.

545
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,220
Hahaha.

546
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:53,800
Hahaha.

547
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:53,860
Okay.

548
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,340
Mmm.

549
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,320
This should be good hee-hee.

550
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,060
Hehe.

551
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,080
Hehe.

552
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,140
I'll use Adam.

553
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,200
If I ever want a text-to-speech.

554
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,360
Hehe.

555
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,120
Hehe.

556
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,540
This is good hee-hee.

557
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,060
Hehe.

558
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,620
Watke hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.

559
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,190
Adam Phantom.

560
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,950
Do you think this is how Miller would speak Japanese?

561
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,830
Wait, hold on.

562
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,910
Can you hear that?

563
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,230
Can you hear me typing?

564
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,550
Okay.

565
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,990
You can?

566
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,510
Okay.

567
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,170
Hello, my name is Kazuhiro Miller.

568
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,070
I am half Japanese and love Japan.

569
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,490
Konnichiwa!

570
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,180
Konnichiwa!

571
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,560
Okay, I'm done.

572
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,320
I'm done with that.

573
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:27,980
I'm done with that.

574
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,720
I'm done with that.

575
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,080
That was so good.

576
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,020
My first day of learning Japanese.

577
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:40,940
Konnichiwa!

578
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,780
Oh, Nihongo Jozu.

579
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,160
Who sounded like...

580
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,160
I'm gonna end up laughing and stressing her words more.

581
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,640
Why don't we just text the speech stream?

582
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,860
I know, they're gonna make me laugh.

583
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,980
At least it's not the narrator.

584
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,300
Do you guys know that?

585
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,000
The narrator?

586
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,260
Do you guys know?

587
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,600
Sorry I'm late.

588
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,360
Thank you!

589
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,660
Thank you so much for the...

590
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,860
For the...

591
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:07,960
For the...

592
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,820
For the...

593
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,580
Thank you.

594
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,460
No?

595
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,180
Okay.

596
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,340
There's gonna be some people that are like, Don't...

597
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,640
Don't bring it back!

598
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,020
Don't do it!

599
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,480
Oh wait, that's not it.

600
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,540
Oh wait, I don't...

601
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:24,840
No.

602
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,340
No.

603
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,320
Sorry.

604
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,200
I actually opened up the wrong thing.

605
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,000
Okay.

606
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,360
There's a special program called Voice Mod.

607
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,420
But I didn't download...

608
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,880
Let me download it right now.

609
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,180
Voice Mod.

610
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,870
I think this one.

611
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,390
Enter my code.

612
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,830
Know it all too well?

613
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,310
The narrator.

614
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,290
You guys who don't know the narrator will soon...

615
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:02,730
Oh my gosh.

616
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,270
Wait.

617
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,550
I'm so excited to introduce you guys.

618
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:08,730
Wait.

619
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,250
I'm too excited for this.

620
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,450
I think.

621
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,470
Sorry.

622
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,790
I'm installing it right now.

623
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,650
I'm installing the program.

624
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,330
I'm way too excited to introduce some of you guys to the narrator.

625
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,310
I'm so excited.

626
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,550
I'm so excited.

627
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,030
I'm so excited right now.

628
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,800
Installing voice mod.

629
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,820
My gut muscles can't take it.

630
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,380
You guys will have abs.

631
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,580
At the end of this.

632
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,460
I promise.

633
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,500
You guys will have abs from how funny this is.

634
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,960
This is wholesome.

635
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,880
Is it?

636
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,600
Is this wholesome?

637
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,940
Okay, launch.

638
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,140
I know, I can't wait to see people's reactions.

639
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,620
Building a summer bod.

640
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,640
Yeah, I'm helping you.

641
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,480
I'm helping you.

642
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,260
I'm helping you.

643
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,540
Okay, get started.

644
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,240
Open.

645
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,280
Verifying account.

646
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,780
Is it verified?

647
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,000
Yeah.

648
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,300
Okay, open.

649
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,340
Sounds good.

650
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,080
My mic is this.

651
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,680
And my output is this.

652
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,380
But I don't want you guys to hear...

653
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,420
How can we do this?

654
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,500
I don't want you guys to...

655
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,060
Hear... Okay, I think I have an idea.

656
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:38,840
What to do.

657
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,440
Start using.

658
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:39,820
Okay.

659
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,470
Whoa.

660
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,810
The program has changed so much since I last used it.

661
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,110
Okay.

662
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,750
I'm gonna mute here.

663
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,910
Oh, you're also gonna lose the audio... Or the... The music.

664
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,330
I can... I can just have it play.

665
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,160
Oh!

666
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,600
Oh my gosh.

667
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,940
I've been talking this whole time.

668
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,920
Wait.

669
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,170
Sorry.

670
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,470
Sorry.

671
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,210
Wait.

672
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,430
I was saying that I can add the music here.

673
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,830
But it might be loud at first.

674
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,430
I don't want to hurt your ears.

675
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,370
Um... I'm trying to figure out.

676
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:50,890
Sorry.

677
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,510
Okay.

678
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,290
Let me just... Let me just... Let me... Let me... Let me... Let me... Let me just do this.

679
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,370
New.

680
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:07,920
Test.

681
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,120
Can you hear me?

682
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,720
Can you hear me right now?

683
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:13,800
Oh.

684
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,460
Can you hear me?

685
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,100
Can you hear me?

686
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,800
Can you hear me?

687
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,900
It's loud.

688
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,600
Oh, sorry.

689
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,000
Okay.

690
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:20,560
Oh.

691
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,620
Ah...

692
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,240
Well, I had to turn it down like crazy.

693
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,480
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

694
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,420
That should be good.

695
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:36,740
Maybe.

696
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,620
No?

697
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,620
It's okay.

698
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,500
I don't even know what I sound like.

699
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,580
Hold on.

700
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,720
I need like a... Oh.

701
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,260
Hear myself.

702
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:45,940
Oh.

703
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,020
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

704
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,300
Okay.

705
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,000
Now...

706
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,900
I find...

707
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,860
The narrator.

708
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,240
What is this?

709
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:53,940
Oh, wait.

710
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,360
Pro.

711
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,480
Do I have...

712
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:56,960
Oh.

713
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,080
I have Pro.

714
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,100
I bought it.

715
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,020
Wait.

716
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,820
Go Pro.

717
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,120
I have Pro.

718
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,080
I bought it.

719
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:06,840
Wait.

720
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:15,290
It's saying that I don't have it.

721
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,250
Wait.

722
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:18,670
No.

723
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,610
I... I did.

724
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:21,750
I bought it.

725
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,350
I... I... I have it.

726
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,530
I have this.

727
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,650
I bought like a...

728
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,630
A lifetime subscription thing.

729
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,570
I'm pretty sure.

730
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,570
But now it's saying I don't have it.

731
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:33,770
No way.

732
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,150
Don't do this to me.

733
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,350
I can't use the narrator.

734
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,090
Wait.

735
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,510
Scam.

736
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,230
I don't think it was an old account.

737
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,670
This is my only account.

738
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,850
It logged me in.

739
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:49,890
Um...

740
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,750
What's this button do?

741
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,170
Oh, it's a recorder.

742
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,590
No way!

743
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,330
Okay, hold on.

744
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,370
Um...

745
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,430
Transaction history.

746
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,050
Yeah, let me go to like the website and see my account.

747
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,790
It's not even like letting me see anything.

748
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,050
What is going on?

749
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,490
It like changed so many things.

750
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,410
What?

751
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,050
What?

752
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,850
Wait, let me try a different account.

753
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,270
Let's see.

754
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,990
Maybe I did use a different email.

755
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,990
I'm just stupid.

756
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,930
Enter a code on install.

757
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,550
It didn't give me an option to do that.

758
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,190
It just installed it.

759
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,430
It did not give me an option to do any...

760
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:48,990
Add any code.

761
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,850
Let's see.

762
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,230
If I log out...

763
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,050
What do I log out?

764
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:54,830
Sorry.

765
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,390
This is becoming a thing, isn't it?

766
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,250
This is becoming a whole thing just for me to try this.

767
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,410
Eh...

768
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,450
Oh, log out.

769
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,030
Log out.

770
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,110
Oh, here we go.

771
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,940
It was a different email!

772
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,280
It was!

773
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,260
It says subscription status active.

774
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,360
One time payment offer.

775
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,280
Okay, now I need to figure out how to log out here though.

776
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,460
Uh...

777
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,190
Log out of my profile in...

778
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,310
Maybe it'll work now.

779
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,590
I'm so confused.

780
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,910
I'm so confused.

781
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,430
We are so back.

782
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,710
Oh yeah, baby.

783
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:50,810
Well, kind of.

784
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,410
We're almost there.

785
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,910
We're almost...

786
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,570
How do I...

787
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,970
How do I...

788
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,510
I don't know how to...

789
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:57,570
Wait.

790
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,110
Actually, let me just close the program.

791
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,920
Okay, you can hear me again.

792
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,660
But it didn't log me out.

793
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:24,960
Hmm...

794
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,100
Hmm...

795
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,520
Oh!

796
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,640
Wait, account.

797
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,540
I found it.

798
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,480
Log...

799
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,770
We did it!

800
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,150
Okay.

801
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,050
Wait.

802
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,050
This one's called Ghost.

803
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,000
Hello.

804
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:47,820
Hello.

805
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,960
It's so freaky.

806
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,120
Oh my god.

807
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,180
I'm like...

808
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,380
I'm like...

809
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,500
Five times.

810
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,820
Oh...

811
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,420
Five octaves higher.

812
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,020
Wait.

813
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,640
This one's called Gold disgust.

814
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,760
This one's called Villager.

815
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,360
Wow.

816
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:57,080
I couldn't even... Anything I said, I just sound like a Minecraft villager.

817
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,120
Okay, guys.

818
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,360
There's the date in the Minecraft movie.

819
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,200
Wait, this one's called Bowtie Billy.

820
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,780
It's like supposed to be the guy.

821
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,920
Wait, this one's called Genki.

822
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,260
What's Genki?

823
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,940
Lo-fi.

824
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,780
Whoa.

825
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,480
Wow.

826
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,020
I sound so... Say so.

827
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,380
Lady.

828
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,160
Konichiwa.

829
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,320
Um.

830
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,700
Uh.

831
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,540
Oh.

832
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,280
Oh.

833
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:34,460
Oh.

834
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,200
She sounds kind of...

835
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Wow.

836
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,420
I keep having to... Just the... Voice.

837
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,360
William.

838
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,620
Okay, I'm gonna do the narrator now.

839
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,760
Wow.

840
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:58,940
Wait.

841
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,900
Did they?

842
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,140
They changed their... It sounds different.

843
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:03,980
Oh.

844
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,200
Oh, no.

845
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,700
Maybe not.

846
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,120
Wait.

847
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,120
The laugh is different, though.

848
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,100
Oh.

849
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,460
Oh.

850
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Oh.

00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:14,860
Oh.

852
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,340
Oh.

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,120
Oh.

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Oh.

855
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,330
Oh.

856
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:20,910
Oh.

857
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,090
Oh.

858
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,810
Oh.

859
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,010
Oh.

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh.

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh.

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh.

870
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh.

871
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh.

872
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh.

873
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh.

874
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh.

00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:24,610
Oh.

880
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:24,610
Oh.

881
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:24,610
Oh.

882
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:24,610
Oh.

Oh.

Oh.

893
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:24,610
Oh.

894
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:24,610
Oh.

Oh.

951
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:38,540
Oh.

00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,100
Oh

960
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,460
Wait...

961
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,280
You guys, there's one called Celestial Narrator.

962
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,840
There's one called Celest... What is this?

963
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,460
Okay, I'm gonna try it.

964
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,420
Hello.

965
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,700
Oh my god!

966
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,180
Why?

967
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,290
It's so having me well.

968
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,210
Why is it like this?

969
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:33,710
Yes.

970
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,090
Why should I kiss?

971
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,090
There's so many new narrators.

972
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,970
There's Presidential Narrator.

973
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,470
There's so... this is all so new now.

The new voice mod.

975
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,410
Oh my gosh.

976
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,430
I missed the old narrator.

977
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,910
You guys, it wasn't the same.

978
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,730
It wasn't the same.

979
00:37:59,350 --> 00:37:59,870
Old narrator.

980
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,370
Wait, this one's called Creepy.

981
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,750
It has like a little creeper.

982
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,350
Wait, is it just gonna make me go...

983
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,070
Because they're so stupid.

984
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,050
Some of these though, I wanna try.

985
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,790
Like there's one called Kawaii.

986
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,610
Where is it?

987
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,410
Oh my gosh.

988
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,230
We're smart as...

989
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:58,850
So silly.

990
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,130
Wait, where'd it go?

991
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,010
I just saw it.

992
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,520
I'm gonna turn into...

993
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,500
I'm gonna turn into actual anime, you guys.

994
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,240
Oh my god.

995
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,360
What if I just use this and then I don't have to...

996
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,340
I don't have to...

997
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,680
Well, I would still have to speak, huh?

998
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,260
Okay, this one's Kawaii.

999
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:38,980
It's!

1000
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,900
Su-goooy!

1001
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,020
I'll take care!

1002
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,480
Su-goooy!

1003
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
It's a theory, huh?

1004
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,020
I can change the colors.

1005
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,600
Can you really understand...

1006
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,260
Bitch.

1007
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,240
Bitch.

1008
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,260
I'm playing around the bitch.

1009
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,760
It's crazy I'm saying...

1010
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,360
It sounds like I'm saying...

1011
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,100
It's just a chipmunk.

1012
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,520
It's not normal.

1013
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,520
It's not cute at all.

1014
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,680
Okay, one more.

1015
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,740
I'm gonna try one more.

1016
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,020
Wait, this one is Lethal Employee.

1017
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,880
They really just said, like, hey, this is Lethal Company.

1018
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,480
Okay, this one is called Akari.

1019
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,030
Wait.

1020
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,850
I sound like a boba boy.

1021
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,730
What's your name, Miku?

1022
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,990
This is, like, I'm, like, the VTuber.

1023
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:43,690
Damn.

1024
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,660
What else should I say?

1025
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,480
Um,

1026
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,580
I'm thinking... wait, one.

1027
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,740
That's awesome.

1028
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,860
Dijian.

1029
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,060
Oh, thank you.

1030
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:16,560
I'm thinking Miku, Miku, oh, I'm thinking Miku, Miku.

1031
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,780
If I... wait, one.

1032
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,160
If I can hear myself, that's how I can only hear the voice, you know?

1033
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,540
But then I can hear myself when there's a little delay.

1034
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,700
And so it's weird.

1035
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,640
I talk weird.

1036
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,620
I talk...

1037
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,980
oh, haha...

1038
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,900
Okay I'm done... let me exit out of voice mine now.

1039
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,590
I'm sad now.

1040
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,690
I feel like the narrator.

1041
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,550
I hyped it up.

1042
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,930
I was like, oh my gosh, I'm so excited.

1043
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,990
I hyped it up for nothing.

1044
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,710
I hyped it up for nothing.

1045
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:32,770
Dang.

1046
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,230
Dang.

1047
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,810
Morgan Freeman still peaking.

1048
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,260
They stabilized him too much.

1049
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,160
Yeah, they fixed it.

1050
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,820
It used to sound way more like scuffed.

1051
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,380
And when he laughed, he would be like...

1052
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,820
It was so good back then when he didn't sound as good.

1053
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,540
Now he sounds too realistic.

1054
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,600
Peace Walker Vocaloid Editor Revival.

1055
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,680
Thank you, Lambda.

1056
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,400
Thank you.

1057
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,140
I don't know what games we're going to play.

1058
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,520
I haven't really thought about it so much.

1059
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,200
I'll be honest.

1060
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,740
I've been way too busy to think about that.

1061
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,480
AI Somnium Viles, maybe not bad though.

1062
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,660
I got asked to do like a collab.

1063
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,980
Like a Ace Attorney collab.

1064
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,780
And I was like...

1065
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,240
I can't...

1066
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,740
I...

1067
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,760
Which, if you don't know...

1068
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,240
I played the trilogy.

1069
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,220
And I voice acted all of it.

1070
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,940
No, I voice acted all of it.

1071
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,160
I played the trilogy...

1072
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,900
Um...

1073
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,860
Before I...

1074
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,480
Before I went to heaven.

1075
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,920
Oh, why not?

1076
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,200
Because I can't read that much right now, you guys.

1077
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,280
There's so much reading.

1078
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,820
It's so much reading.

1079
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,800
Yeah...

1080
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,680
It's been...

1081
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:26,940
It's...

1082
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,360
It's really hard right now too.

1083
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,320
Because I've been like...

1084
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,280
I've been...

1085
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,220
You know...

1086
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,080
Obviously...

1087
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm still working on stuff.

1088
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,340
And it's been a matter of...

1089
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,140
Balancing how I can stream.

1090
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:43,620
And also...

1091
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,210
How I can...

1092
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,560
Do some of these...

1093
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,340
Projects.

1094
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,060
You know what I mean?

1095
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,600
So...

1096
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,520
It's...

1097
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,240
That's...

1098
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,520
The...

1099
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,420
Hardest thing.

1100
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,760
At the moment.

1101
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,600
Because like...

1102
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,120
I'm getting opportunities for things.

1103
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,680
But my voice is...

1104
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,880
My voice can't do both.

1105
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:05,380
Essentially.

1106
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,330
My voice can't...

1107
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,320
Sing and also...

1108
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,120
And also stream...

1109
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,280
For...

1110
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,120
The amount of time...

1111
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,940
That I want to.

1112
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,760
So...

1113
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,800
It's just...

1114
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,220
That's where it's been.

1115
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,520
And it's frustrating to me.

1116
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,440
Because I feel like...

1117
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,180
You know...

1118
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,400
Obviously...

1119
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,340
Things will...

1120
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,660
Be shown to you guys eventually.

1121
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:33,500
But...

1122
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,400
Right now...

1123
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:34,860
It's just...

1124
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,680
It feels like...

1125
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,320
I have nothing.

1126
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,180
So I'm sorry.

1127
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,640
Um...

1128
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,570
Hopefully the lesser streaming load helps.

1129
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:52,970
So...

1130
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:53,170
Yeah...

1131
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,170
I didn't want to say that I was taking like a break.

1132
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:56,730
You know...

1133
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:01,780
Until...

1134
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,420
Until I can be like...

1135
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,280
Yeah...

1136
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,120
I think my...

1137
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,740
And then of course I will also go to the...

1138
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,140
Hospital...

1139
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,940
And try and see a doctor and everything too...

1140
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,600
So...

1141
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,520
Reduce the schedule.

1142
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,640
Yeah...

1143
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:25,820
Yeah...

1144
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,280
Yeah...

1145
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,540
I just feel bad.

1146
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,520
I'm sorry guys.

1147
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,080
That I'm...

1148
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,560
That...

1149
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,080
That...

1150
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,560
That my ectoplasm is weak.

1151
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,920
My ectoplasm is too weak.

1152
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,680
You'd think I wouldn't have issues with this.

1153
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,480
As a ghost.

1154
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,760
But uh...

1155
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,160
Yeah...

1156
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,970
And I figured...

1157
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:05,230
Um...

1158
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:05,610
You know...

1159
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,010
I feel...

1160
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:06,850
I was like...

1161
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:07,450
Maybe...

1162
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:08,750
You know...

1163
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,590
People would be...

1164
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,710
Maybe a little more understanding...

1165
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:14,510
Because of...

1166
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:14,790
You know...

1167
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,750
How we...

1168
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,510
Lost someone...

1169
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:17,990
Like...

1170
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:19,610
Someone else graduated...

1171
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,510
Not too long ago...

1172
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,210
Due to...

1173
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,570
Their throat...

1174
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,370
And obviously...

1175
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,610
I don't think it's...

1176
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,190
At that point at all...

1177
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,890
You know...

1178
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,210
So...

1179
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:32,770
Um...

1180
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:33,050
Like...

1181
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,170
I don't think it's even...

1182
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,510
Close to that...

1183
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:37,890
But...

1184
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,130
I also would be so sad if I...

1185
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:41,430
Couldn't...

1186
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,350
Sing anymore either...

1187
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:45,850
So...

1188
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,620
Yeah...

1189
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,470
So I...

1190
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,090
Think...

1191
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,730
I will call it...

1192
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:10,010
Here...

1193
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,110
Maybe...

1194
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:11,630
I said...

1195
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,730
I did say it would be a short...

1196
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:14,110
Uh...

1197
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,330
Yup...

1198
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:17,050
So...

1199
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,080
Um...

1200
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,420
Um...

1201
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,360
Thank you guys for letting me take the...

1202
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:23,820
Week off...

1203
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,440
And then of course I will be gone for...

1204
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:27,520
Uh...

1205
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,560
Uh...

1206
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,240
About a...

1207
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,420
About almost maybe...

1208
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,260
Two weeks...

1209
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,640
Coming this...

1210
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,740
End of this week...

1211
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:35,900
Haha...

1212
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:36,940
So...

1213
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,240
Um...

1214
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,820
Glad you have a chance to collab with Koyo...

1215
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,340
Before she graduates...

1216
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,160
Yeah...

1217
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,360
Yeah...

1218
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,020
Keep a good feeling balance...

1219
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,440
Thank you...

1220
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,740
Thank you...

1221
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,040
Thank you...

1222
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,220
Thank you...

1223
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,100
Thank you...

1224
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,340
Oh...

1225
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,560
Don't stress over your voice...

1226
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:54,980
Don't stress over your voice...

1227
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:55,960
Haha...

1228
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,420
I cannot...

1229
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,540
But...

1230
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:57,720
Oh...

1231
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,860
I stress so much...

1232
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,000
I can't help but...

1233
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,440
Only stress...

1234
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,240
Haha...

1235
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:04,960
Which I'm like...

1236
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,580
It's kind of out of my control...

1237
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,380
Like I didn't...

1238
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:07,920
You know...

1239
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,340
I didn't think I would get the bunkaitis...

1240
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:10,700
And...

1241
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,600
That it would...

1242
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,820
You know...

1243
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,840
I don't even...

1244
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,740
Oh gosh...

1245
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:30,450
Uh...

1246
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,870
We'll do some stuff...

1247
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,290
That like...

1248
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,490
Doesn't involve me...

1249
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:38,130
Singing...

1250
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:39,390
Or talking too much...

1251
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,850
Obviously I won't be doing any karaoke...

1252
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,190
No karaoke streams...

1253
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:42,690
For...

1254
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,790
I don't know...

1255
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:45,430
Well...

1256
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:46,910
Maybe until my birthday...

1257
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:49,270
Haha...

1258
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,750
Um...

1259
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,050
Yeah...

1260
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,710
Movie watch-alongs...

1261
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,430
And...

1262
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,110
Um...

1263
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,750
Things like that...

1264
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,410
Eh...

1265
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,330
Haha...

1266
00:49:59,630 --> 00:49:59,940
Nah...

1267
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,230
Karaoke VOD replay...

1268
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,530
Oh!

1269
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:03,830
While I'm gone...

1270
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:04,750
I will have a...

1271
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,310
Probably...

1272
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:06,470
Most likely a VOD...

1273
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,050
Relay on...

1274
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,290
I don't know if it'll just be karaoke though...

1275
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,170
I don't have that many karaoke's...

1276
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,170
Streams...

1277
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,130
So...

1278
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,800
Cough drops...

1279
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,880
Tasting stream...

1280
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,840
Oh...

1281
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,500
Golly...

1282
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:29,860
How...

1283
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,700
I've...

1284
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,260
God...

1285
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:31,580
God...

1286
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,360
I have so many...

1287
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,140
Actually...

1288
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:34,620
Oh good...

1289
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,560
Oh my goodness...

1290
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,140
Yes...

1291
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,260
I ran out of these ones...

1292
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,600
These like...

1293
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,600
Asahi...

1294
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,840
Mintia voice ones...

1295
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,120
Have been so good...

1296
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,140
I have one package left...

1297
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,660
So when I go back to Japan...

1298
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,880
We'll get some more...

1299
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,800
Tier list...

1300
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:53,500
Haha...

1301
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,840
These ones are so so good...

1302
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,680
Because they're not like...

1303
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:56,960
You know...

1304
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,020
Like the menthol...

1305
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:58,660
Like they feel...

1306
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,660
Like...

1307
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,020
But they help...

1308
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,940
You can hear me opening...

1309
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,760
Sorry...

1310
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,660
It's lemon ginger...

1311
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,580
So it tastes yummy...

1312
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,900
And then it also...

1313
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,220
Helps so much...

1314
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,420
Come on...

1315
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,500
Come out...

1316
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,260
Come out...

1317
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,980
I lost my voice for like...

1318
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,840
Four months...

1319
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,580
A few years ago...

1320
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,940
Turns out I just need music...

1321
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,040
I'm scared though...

1322
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,540
If I go to the doctors...

1323
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,700
What if they have to shove something down my throat...

1324
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,580
I'm scared...

1325
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,500
I'm scared...

1326
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:47,840
Mintia...

1327
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,100
I'm scared...

1328
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,500
But if they do...

1329
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,820
If they take a picture...

1330
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,180
I'll show...

1331
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,200
I'll show you guys...

1332
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,760
If they do...

1333
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,960
I'll ask them to take a picture...

1334
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,420
And then I'll show you guys...

1335
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,500
Do you?

1336
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:32,920
Okay...

1337
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,980
You could call me...

1338
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,860
You could call me...

1339
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,380
Deep Throat...

1340
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:45,550
Not the tonsil reveal...

1341
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:46,370
What if they're like...

1342
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,330
Really ugly...

1343
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:49,690
Oh my gosh...

1344
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:50,530
How embarrassing...

1345
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,050
Don't look at my ugly tonsils...

1346
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,150
Wait...

1347
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,830
How do you know...

1348
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,230
If you need your tonsils removed?

1349
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,500
How would you know?

1350
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,940
Is it a hurt thing?

1351
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,720
You ask a doctor...

1352
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:09,680
Do they hurt?

1353
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,090
Swelling...

1354
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:22,310
You have tonsillitis...

1355
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,810
What if I get them out...

1356
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:29,010
And I ask for them...

1357
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,670
And I return them to me...

1358
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:32,310
On a little plate...

1359
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,490
And then we dissect them...

1360
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:34,900
On string...

1361
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,560
Keep them in a jar...

1362
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,880
Whoa...

1363
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,140
Sashibis?

1364
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,500
Ew...

1365
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,840
Then we eat it...

1366
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,320
What is this?

1367
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:53,960
The placenta?

1368
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,080
Yeah...

1369
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,420
The Spongebob movie scene...

1370
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:07,760
What...

1371
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,160
What...

1372
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,120
What scene are you talking about?

1373
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,460
You could stream them being removed?

1374
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,000
Okay...

1375
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,660
I'll be like...

1376
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,340
Okay doc...

1377
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,580
Explain what you're doing...

1378
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,420
Oh my gosh...

1379
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,000
Would they...

1380
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,320
Would they make me have that anesthesia?

1381
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,330
Would I be talking silliness?

1382
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,570
Illiness...

1383
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:37,090
Yes?

1384
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:42,390
What if...

1385
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:43,030
What if I...

1386
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,570
What if I get conked out...

1387
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,090
And then...

1388
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:46,410
My doctor starts talking...

1389
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,310
Uh...

1390
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:50,210
Smack about me...

1391
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:51,570
And I'll...

1392
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:52,470
What if he's like...

1393
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:54,830
This stupid ghost...

1394
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:00,330
I'll just tell him I'm a TikTok streamer...

1395
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,330
I'm a TikTok influencer...

1396
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,710
I could sue...

1397
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:12,210
I could...

1398
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:13,650
Yeah...

1399
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:14,590
Everybody is watching...

1400
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:15,930
That would be quite a feat, huh?

1401
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:19,690
That would be the VTuber event of the year, maybe...

1402
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,230
Me toes...

1403
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,210
Me toes...

1404
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:23,710
Throat surgery...

1405
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:31,430
Yep...

1406
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:32,990
It's peak...

1407
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:39,450
It would be educational, I feel...

1408
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,710
Probably...

1409
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,390
Tonsil graduation...

1410
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,690
I don't think I'll have to get my tonsils out...

1411
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:45,090
But...

1412
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,990
I hope I also don't need like a surgery...

1413
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,710
Obviously...

1414
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:49,990
We will see after...

1415
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:52,210
After...

1416
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:52,770
A...

1417
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:54,050
Three month period...

1418
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,310
Of me healing...

1419
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,850
And what I'm gonna try and do...

1420
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:59,990
Is also do like a pretty consistent...

1421
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,850
I know I said that I would have no schedule...

1422
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:06,010
But I'm gonna try and do like a...

1423
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,990
Maybe like a Monday...

1424
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,670
Thursday...

1425
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:12,110
Sunday...

1426
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:12,990
Kind of schedule...

1427
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,990
So that you guys can...

1428
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,630
Feel like there's a little bit of consistency, you know?

1429
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:21,630
I don't know...

1430
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:39,510
So...

1431
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,370
Three times oblivion...

1432
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,210
What if the doc played a karaoke stream?

1433
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,350
Oh my gosh...

1434
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,410
What if he...

1435
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,230
What if he...

1436
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,150
Timed the stream to the songs?

1437
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,510
Would Minto and...

1438
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,710
Anesthesia be really more freaky than a normal Minto?

1439
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,710
So I'm afraid of what I would ever say...

1440
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:06,830
I've seen some...

1441
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:06,990
I've...

1442
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,750
I love watching those kinds of videos...

1443
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,710
Of people on anesthesia...

1444
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:13,350
Actually...

1445
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:15,470
For those who know...

1446
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:16,710
The artist Duskal...

1447
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:20,910
She's my wife...

1448
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,090
And she...

1449
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,630
Had a tooth thing...

1450
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:24,710
And she went on anesthesia...

1451
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,470
And...

1452
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,670
Um...

1453
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:28,130
And...

1454
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:28,890
She...

1455
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:29,130
I...

1456
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,510
She sent me a video...

1457
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,130
Of...

1458
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:32,250
When she was...

1459
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,330
She was being filmed...

1460
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:35,070
And...

1461
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:36,070
She...

1462
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,810
Was asking for me...

1463
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,630
So many wives...

1464
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,490
Around here...

1465
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:51,430
Yeah...

1466
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,980
Like...

1467
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,540
That person filming was just like...

1468
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,440
Who do you wanna see?

1469
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,440
And she was like...

1470
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,680
I wanna see mint...

1471
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:06,480
Even...

1472
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:07,940
Even...

1473
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,000
Even...

1474
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,280
On...

1475
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,080
Even...

1476
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,120
Drugged up...

1477
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,660
She was thinking about me...

1478
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,180
So I want all of you guys...

1479
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,730
To be the same...

1480
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,720
But if I think...

1481
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,180
If I were...

1482
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:22,820
I don't know...

1483
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,820
If I'm on anesthesia...

1484
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,400
I'd be like...

1485
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:26,880
Chat...

1486
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,740
Chat...

1487
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,420
Chat...

1488
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,620
Is this real?

1489
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,760
I'd be...

1490
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,680
Oh my gosh...

1491
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,560
I would probably ask for us a lot...

1492
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,680
I think...

1493
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,340
Oh my gosh...

1494
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,740
That would be so embarrassing...

1495
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,280
I don't want you guys to hear my real thoughts about him...

1496
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,380
I don't guys...

1497
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,760
My real thoughts about Metal Gear...

1498
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,980
That would be...

1499
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,420
The most embarrassing thing ever...

1500
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,480
I will never...

1501
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,840
I will never go on anesthesia...

1502
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,700
And talk about...

1503
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,720
My real thoughts on Metal Gear...

1504
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,740
And I will never...

1505
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,960
Get drunk and talk about my...

1506
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,740
You don't know!

1507
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,620
You guys...

1508
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,760
You guys don't even...

1509
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,700
You guys don't...

1510
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,380
I've only scratched the surface...

1511
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,380
You guys actually don't know so much...

1512
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,860
I've never told you...

1513
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:51,140
I've never told you... I do keep secrets sometimes... I do... I do keep my own secrets... enlighten us... Maybe one day... If I ever do a drunk stream... The truth will come out...

1514
00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:01,910
Non-filtered Metal Gear thoughts... What

1515
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:05,960
kind of secrets?

1516
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:24,370
Without being specific... A secret makes a woman... Woman... Gosh, I want to watch Conan... Detective Conan... I haven't watched in so long... She actually loves Naomi...

1517
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:35,860
Drunk off collab straight with my wives...

1518
01:00:39,580 --> 01:01:06,840
That would involve everybody getting together... Might be kind of hard... I would like to do another off collab stream... Sometime though... It would be fun... You know, just also... Like... Singing French... And stuff... But I'll be seeing Koyo soon... I'll be seeing Coyote...

1519
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:29,420
So definitely... Watch her graduation... 3D... She announced who else was in it... Oh my gosh... I can already feel my throat... Feel like... Sounding better... Because of that cough drop... I told you... It works so well... Um, hold on... She announced who it was... Let me go see... Uh,

1520
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:36,820
she's sad... Uh, Dire Wolf... And Hululu... Oh my gosh...

1521
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,480
Wonderful... We get to meet Hululu... That's like... So surreal though, no?

1522
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:50,800
Like... I have... I have like... Kemono Friends mug... You know?

1523
01:01:51,040 --> 01:02:06,740
And I have... A boss... Plushie... Like... I really love... Kemono Friends... I can't believe... It's so... So surreal... And like... Hululu... Remember... Do you guys remember how... Hululu was the penguin that... Yeah, Grape Kunz Waifu...

1524
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:20,820
Yeah, yeah... The Hululu was the penguin that... Um... That... Grape Kunz... The penguin fell in love with... Like the little standee... Yeah... How many years ago was that now?

1525
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:35,790
Rip Grape Kunz... Yeah... Yeah... 87 years ago...

1526
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,490
So yeah... I'm like...

1527
01:02:41,490 --> 01:03:10,630
Really honored... That... That Koyo asked me... Um... Like so so honored... Cause you know... Um... I think I've mentioned it before... But you know... I've... I've... Been friends with her... Um... We just never really... We just never really... Made it... Public... Or anything... You know... We never... Like we collabed that one time... Uh... Like a month ago or so... And... Um...

1528
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,980
That we'll be collabing this week...

1529
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:47,960
But... But... It's... It just goes to show... How... Much... You know... I guess... Is going on behind the scenes... You know... That you... Some... You would never know... What people know each other... Maybe... But... Um... I love Koyo... She's so cute... So talented... I'm a big fan of her... Actually... I... I... More than friends... I was a fan of her first... I was a fan of her first...

1530

1536
01:05:32,310 --> 01:06:04,540

1537
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:33,780
But also... If you hear me singing... Please remember... That... My voice does not be good... Hehehe... So... Don't be too... Judgy... Try not to judge too hard... If I don't sound so great... If I'm singing in things... I... Just don't want to say no to opportunities... Because... Opportunities are important... Hehehe... Hehehe... Okay... Okay... I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go...
