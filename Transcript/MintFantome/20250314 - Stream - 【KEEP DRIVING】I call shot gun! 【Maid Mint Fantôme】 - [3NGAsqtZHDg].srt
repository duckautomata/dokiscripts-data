1
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,500
Hello!

2
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,440
Hello, hello, hello.

3
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Oh, DVR is on.

4
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,980
I turned it off.

5
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:51,980
Thank you.

6
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,040
It's very rare that I start on the screen...

7
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,920
before a game.

8
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,760
But I'm eating dinner because I just got home.

9
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,420
I'm so sorry.

10
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,060
For VOD watchers, you probably don't care.

11
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,420
You're probably like, this doesn't pertain to me.

12
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,660
But for everybody else, I'm sorry.

13
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,260
I'm like an hour and a half late.

14
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,820
Because I...

15
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,720
I got a new car.

16
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,940
Woohoo!

17
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Yippee!

18
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,300
I posted it...

19
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,200
I posted it in pre-chat.

20
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,420
I was like, I got a Cybertruck!

21
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,260
Oh yeah.

22
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,880
That's where your donos are going to.

23
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,340
Oh yeah, I got a Ferrari.

24
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,200
I got a Maserati.

25
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,220
I got a...

26
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,580
A body-ody.

27
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,620
But I was at the...

28
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,200
I was at the dealership for like...

29
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,300
A Bugatti!

30
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,350
I was at the dealership for like...

31
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,020
many hours.

32
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,660
So I'm tired.

33
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,080
I like the difference between the two messages.

34
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,040
I'll give 10 if it's actually a Cybertruck.

35
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,420
Or Cybertruck, I'm cancelling.

36
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,720
No, obviously I'm not going to say what my actual new car is, but...

37
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,460
It's good.

38
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,220
I like it.

39
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,880
I was going to get a...

40
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,440
Oh my gosh, my voice is really bad today.

41
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,700
Did you get the Rex or the Ray?

42
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,220
I think it's more Rex than Ray.

43
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,500
Congrats on the new Cobra car, boss.

44
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,500
Thank you!

45
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,600
Yeah, it's a cardboard box.

46
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,060
What company is...

47
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,220
I'm not going to say anything!

48
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
Oh my gosh.

49
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,460
I won't even say the year, I'm too scared.

50
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,680
It is a used car though.

51
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,440
I will at least say that.

52
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,780
I did not get a new car.

53
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,420
I did get a used car.

54
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,720
But I was looking at another car.

55
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,080
I wonder if it's okay to say it.

56
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,440
Probably because it doesn't have any link.

57
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,740
You know?

58
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,640
Maybe.

59
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,240
But I was looking at another car.

60
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,240
And I actually...

61
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,600
Test drove it today.

62
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,620
And I was like...

63
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,800
Actually, I don't like this.

64
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,560
So...

65
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,640
I went with the car that I...

66
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,740
And the car that I got was cheaper anyway, so...

67
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,160
The car that I looked at initially would have been...

68
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,240
Would have been a new car.

69
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,540
And...

70
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,420
I have to name it.

71
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,960
I have to name it.

72
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,160
Maybe...

73
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,060
Maybe...

74
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,900
Maybe I will name it Rex.

75
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,540
Does it fit 20 people?

76
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,620
Yeah.

77
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:45,880
Probably.

78
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,120
Thank you so much for that, Kazuma!

79
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,640
Thank you!

80
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,500
I got the Wienermobile.

81
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,500
Coming to a local...

82
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,900
Coming to your local town.

83
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,280
The Wienermobile.

84
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,660
Sorry, I didn't have a...

85
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,050
I didn't have time to eat.

86
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,350
Thank you so much for the 50!

87
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,490
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted!

88
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,010
It's your birthday!

89
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,650
I can sing happy birthday.

90
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,010
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

91
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,950
Thank you guys.

92
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,410
Hold on.

93
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,850
Let me put down my fries.

94
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,290
Let me put down my fries and my fork.

95
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,970
Happy birthday to you!

96
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,970
Happy birthday to you!

97
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,750
Happy birthday dear Rodrigo!

98
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,870
Happy birthday to you!

99
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,330
Happy birthday.

100
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,190
Sorry, I think the drink I got is like messing up my throat.

101
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,590
So I have to get some tea after.

102
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,160
You say you're eating fries with a fork?

103
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,780
You don't?

104
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
I don't want to get my fingies dirty.

105
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,260
Dirty.

106
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,780
And also...

107
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,360
The chicken nuggies.

108
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,870
I don't want to get it on my keyboard.

109
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,760
You know...

110
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,420
Going to get a pliskinitasha?

111
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,820
Oh my gosh, I wish.

112
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,380
I wish!

113
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,380
Everyone would be like, wow.

114
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,320
That ghost scar is so cool.

115
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,320
No.

116
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,420
Who's that incredible hunk that's on that car?

117
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,640
He looks a little familiar.

118
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,640
No.

119
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,340
It couldn't be.

120
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,140
Is that Iroquois pliskin?

121
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,440
Of...

122
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,800
I don't remember what he said he's a part of.

123
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
The seals.

124
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,020
Yeah, I was like, it's a navy something, no?

125
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,500
I don't think he was a...

126
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,840
I don't think he... no.

127
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,220
He was...

128
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,260
He was not a marine.

129
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,200
But he said the Semper Fi, which was weird, right?

130
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,080
And that's why...

131
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,880
What's his name?

132
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,480
Cloctam.

133
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,980
Mr. Bomb Man.

134
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,100
Not Fat Man.

135
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,260
Other Bomb Man.

136
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,800
Yeah, he wasn't a marine, but he said Semper Fi.

137
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,500
Stillman.

138
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,780
Thank you.

139
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,340
I remember.

140
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,300
I know.

141
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,790
I know what I'm talking about.

142
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,050
Fake fan.

143
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,190
David, why are you not David anymore?

144
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,130
Why are you Dapen?

145
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,390
It was my birthday on Saturday, the day the collab cafe started.

146
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,570
You weren't streaming then.

147
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,930
Yeah, I was in Japan.

148
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,250
I can sing Happy Birthday.

149
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,750
Happy Birthday to you.

150
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,570
Happy Birthday to you.

151
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,330
Happy Birthday, dear Blotch.

152
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,070
Happy Birthday to you.

153
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,450
Happy Birthday.

154
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,670
I've always kind of wondered about that.

155
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,390
Like, why is Snake not...

156
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:20,390
no.

157
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,430
Like, was he not in the military?

158
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,450
Maybe he...

159
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,510
Because he was kind of born into it?

160
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,520
Maybe it's Maybelline?

161
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,940
He was an accountant.

162
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
I think he's just a little dumb.

163
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,990
I saw the photos from the collab cafe.

164
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,530
Oh, the food looks so good.

165
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,810
Will Yummy Mama be putting up extra merch for sale?

166
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,930
Yes, if you want the merch...

167
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,130
Actually, you can go to the cafe.

168
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,190
They will be putting up...

169
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,230
It's a...

170
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,330
Like, pre-order?

171
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,550
It's made...

172
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,810
Order to merch...

173
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,850
Wait, order...

174
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,510
Made to order!

175
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,630
It's made to order.

176
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,470
So, it won't, like, sell out or anything.

177
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,790
I imagine it will be for a limited amount of time.

178
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,430
And I will double confirm that time frame for you guys.

179
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,010
But...

180
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,990
But...

181
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,390
Yes, it's made to order.

182
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,290
And so...

183
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,790
If you wanted any of the merch...

184
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,250
You could get it.

185
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,430
If you wanted to.

186
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,180
Oh!

187
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,320
You guys, did you watch the Silent Hill transmission?

188
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,360
Can we watch it together?

189
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,460
Together?

190
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,640
I saw that they showed off the new...

191
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,700
Silent Hill F.

192
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,340
And I wanna watch it.

193
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,980
Hold on real quick.

194
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,080
Let me get it up.

195
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,580
Let me get it up.

196
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,160
I'm a very slow eater.

197
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,980
I'm really sorry.

198
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,460
Especially when I'm talking.

199
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,620
So, I'm like...

200
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,300
I'll probably...

201
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,160
I'll just eat until I'm like...

202
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,020
Okay.

203
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,540
I'm really hungry.

204
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,220
I was getting hangry.

205
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,980
I was getting hangry at the place.

206
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,640
I was like...

207
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,340
I wanna eat.

208
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,000
Maybe this is okay.

209
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,360
Hold on, I'm pulling it up.

210
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:00,880
Sorry, guys.

211
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:01,980
Okay.

212
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,620
There.

213
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,700
And there.

214
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,600
Should be okay.

215
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,120
I don't want it cutting off anything.

216
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:12,760
There we go.

217
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,000
I haven't watched this yet.

218
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,480
But I really wanted to because, you know, the new...

219
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,460
I was gonna say the new Higurashi.

220
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,460
The new Silent Hill is...

221
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,540
Ryukishi.

222
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,140
So, Ryukishi 7.

223
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,440
So I was like...

224
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,480
This is my first full...

225
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,560
This is my first look.

226
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,140
I'm gonna...

227
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,960
Let's see.

228
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,720
That was the audio.

229
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,620
Actually, let me turn it up a little.

230
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,870
It looks so pretty.

231
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,210
Yeah.

232
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,950
Oh my god, it's so pretty.

233
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,830
Oh my god!

234
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,870
It's so pretty.

235
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,330
What in the fatal frame?

236
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,410
It's so...

237
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,690
I did see though that they based the location off of a real...

238
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,850
This picture I saw.

239
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,110
They based it off of a real place in Gifu.

240
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,330
Time to go.

241
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:54,930
Pilgrimage.

242
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,790
Oh my god!

243
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,690
Oh my god!

244
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,370
Oh my god!

245
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,450
Oh my god, it's so awesome.

246
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,770
Oh, I'm so...

247
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,090
Oh, I'm so obsessed.

248
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,350
What did she do to go to Silent Hill?

249
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,170
Hinako, what did you do?

250
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,110
Wait, there is a body there.

251
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,550
Didn't flush.

252
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,590
I'm not scared, I'm in love.

253
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,650
I love this so much already.

254
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,650
I love how this is not explaining anything.

255
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,030
It's not explaining anything.

256
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,190
It's just all aesthetics.

257
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,650
What is that flower called again?

258
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,910
It represents death.

259
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:07,910
Ew.

260
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,090
I'm eating.

261
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,530
Spider lily, yeah, yeah, yeah.

262
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,250
Cue combat sequence.

263
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,470
Do we have a release date or anything?

264
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,250
I think so.

265
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,490
It looks so...

266
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:52,890
Oh my god.

267
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,090
I don't like that part.

268
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,230
Gross.

269
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,150
Fatal frame.

270
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,190
It's truly...

271
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,890
Oh my gosh.

272
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,950
Look at this visual.

273
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,630
It looks like fatal frame so much.

274
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:14,910
Ew.

275
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,830
Which honestly makes me the happiest.

276
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,870
I love fatal frame.

277
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,470
It's so pretty.

278
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,110
Hold on.

279
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,210
Let's go back to this lady.

280
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,550
I really liked her.

281
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,110
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

282
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,510
Sorry, I'm having...

283
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,070
It looks kind of mannequin-like.

284
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,050
So maybe it's supposed to be like the nurse.

285
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,910
Or I guess...

286
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,030
I guess there was like the mannequins and, you know, the other ones.

287
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,690
Yeah, doll-like.

288
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,550
Very cool.

289
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,850
Oh, it's so pretty.

290
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,870
So pretty.

291
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,830
It's too...

292
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,830
Oh, this thing too.

293
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,310
It's too pretty to be scary.

294
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:06,910
Nasty.

295
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,390
It's too pretty to be scary in my opinion, maybe.

296
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,350
Oh, going feral for this atmosphere.

297
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,010
Me too!

298
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,090
Oh my gosh.

299
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,010
So it doesn't...

300
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,850
No, we didn't get a...

301
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:22,050
Wait.

302
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,510
Wait.

303
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,650
Wishlist now.

304
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,130
Wait, is this on Steam?

305
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,650
Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam, Steam.

306
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,510
Silent.

307
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:36,990
Oh, oh, it is.

308
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,010
Oh yeah.

309
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,190
Oh yeah.

310
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,950
Only PS5?

311
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,430
No, no.

312
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,010
I think it's because I watched it on Playstation's...

313
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,190
I watched it on their YouTube.

314
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,710
Actually Konami, not sponsored obviously, but Konami is doing a spring sale.

315
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:01,650
And like all the Metal Gear games are on sale if you wanted to pick them up.

316
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,570
It's on Steam, but they don't mention it on the trailer.

317
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,570
Could be, like I said, because it's a...

318
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,210
What do you call the Playstation trailer?

319
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,670
It looks so pretty.

320
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,110
What do you mean obviously?

321
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,130
Because it's like, I wouldn't...

322
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,010
I couldn't, I couldn't like do a sponsor in the middle of this keep driving stream.

323
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,810
That would be so silly.

324
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,510
Did you see the new DMC anime trailer?

325
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,050
I did, I did.

326
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,430
And yes, I did see the Death Stranding 2 trailer.

327
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,750
But...

328
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,390
But...

329
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,990
Like I know that there's a guy that looks just like Snake.

330
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,330
And there's a machine that looks just like Rex.

331
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,150
But, because I haven't finished Death Stranding 1, I've been...

332
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,650
I've been mostly avoiding...

333
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,990
Any sort of like active watching of the trailers.

334
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,730
Because I don't want any kind of spoilers.

335
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,050
So, I do know that those things are in the trailer.

336
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,450
But I haven't like actively watched the trailer itself.

337
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,730
Just being like...

338
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,850
That guy looks just like Solid Snake.

339
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,930
No, that is not Solid Snake.

340
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,130
What if it's like...

341
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,930
What if he is like...

342
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,290
Hardened Asp.

343
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,900
And then, was there a release date for Death Stranding 2?

344
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,560
I saw some people saying this summer.

345
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,860
Do I have to...

346
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,200
Do I have to get my butt in gear and finish it?

347
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,180
June something.

348
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,040
June, oh no!

349
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,380
Okay.

350
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,780
I'm trying to decide if I want to stream Death Stranding or not.

351
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,600
Like the original.

352
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,180
Maybe.

353
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,200
I know it's like hard game to stream.

354
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,860
I don't really care so much about like...

355
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,540
Like being a viewership game.

356
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,840
Some games you just always want to do for yourself, you know?

357
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,500
It's chill.

358
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,090
We can play the music on stream now?

359
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,310
Oh yeah, because I don't care about copyright.

360
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,830
My streams get flagged.

361
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,270
My streams lose monetization all the time.

362
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,350
It's okay.

363
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,970
It's okay for the...

364
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:10,870
For the...

365
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,050
Like even this game.

366
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,870
Keep driving.

367
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,530
Last time, it got...

368
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,730
It got monetized flagged.

369
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,270
You know?

370
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,750
But I don't even think...

371
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,750
I don't even think I make like enough views to...

372
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,070
Really even affect...

373
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,370
You know?

374
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,370
For me to care.

375
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,630
Wasn't it because you turned off streamer mode?

376
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,450
Yeah, because I wanted us to listen to the music.

377
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,110
Obviously.

378
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,190
I would much rather have the vibes.

379
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,170
If they don't take super money, it's not that big of a deal.

380
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:58,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

381
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,730
Exactly, exactly.

382
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,090
Then I would be mad because it's like...

383
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,250
They'd be taking your money.

384
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,610
And that would upset me the most.

385
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,450
Is this Minto monetization?

386
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,590
The Minto monetization...

387
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,300
Network.

388
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,060
The M-M-N.

389
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,660
The mmm...

390
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,240
Mmm...

391
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,440
But yeah, I'm almost done with my food.

392
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,360
I'm so sorry, you guys.

393
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,420
I'm almost done.

394
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,020
Well, I'm glad we could watch that trailer together.

395
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,480
Thank you for...

396
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,760
Someone mentioned Death Stranding and it made me think of this that I wanted.

397
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,100
I was like...

398
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,180
While I'm eating...

399
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,560
While I'm eating, I can...

400
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,820
Watch it with you guys.

401
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:02,340
Is there anything else you guys want to...

402
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,400
Anything else I should react to?

403
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm a react channel real fast.

404
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,140
What am I eating?

405
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,520
I'm eating chicken nuggies.

406
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,500
And fries.

407
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,440
Minto, Beat Death Stranding on stream, my life is yours.

408
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,120
Thank you so much for the Haka Super.

409
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,500
Okay, maybe I will do it then.

410
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,720
Maybe I could do like a Death Stranding week or something, you know?

411
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,980
Maybe I could do something like that since...

412
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,040
It might be a better game to do like all at once.

413
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,060
Devil May Cry trailer?

414
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Oh yeah, we can watch that.

415
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,440
Oh yeah, we can watch that.

416
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,700
Sorry I haven't caught a stream live in a while, but I'm always watching both.

417
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,440
Thank you!

418
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,420
It's my birthday today, but thank you for being bit...

419
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,960
Thank you Ix300!

420
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,320
Thank you!

421
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,700
Hold on, let me finish chewing.

422
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,460
Netflix takes down vids?

423
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,620
I was thinking just...

424
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,640
The...

425
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,740
The song in it.

426
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,800
Happy birthday to you!

427
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,960
Happy birthday to you!

428
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,700
Happy birthday Ix300!

429
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,380
Happy birthday to you!

430
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,840
Happy birthday!

431
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,000
Let's get rid of this now.

432
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,520
And I'll go back here now.

433
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,560
I will bring back the menu now.

434
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,420
And yeah.

435
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,320
Ever since the new model, Minto chewing has been 100 times cuter.

436
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:25,780
No!

437
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,060
I'm so self-conscious!

438
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,180
Stop!

439
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,160
No!

440
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,200
Don't watch me chewing!

441
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,240
But you can see I'm chewing with my mouth closed like a little lady.

442
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,150
Do you give your meals the maid cafe blessing?

443
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,890
Why would I?

444
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,290
I'm the source of the moe energy.

445
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,610
I'm the source of the deliciousness.

446
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,050
Wow, something is so delicious.

447
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,670
Where could it be coming from?

448
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:59,850
Right here.

449
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,450
Yummy, baby.

450
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,170
Moe moe cannibalism.

451
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,890
Yeah, why don't you guys...

452
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,770
Would you guys like to bless my fry that I'm about to eat from?

453
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,050
Right?

454
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,730
Moe moe bless you.

455
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,810
Moe moe cute!

456
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:45,310
OK, I'm going to try it now since you guys blessed it.

457
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,770
I'm going to try it!

458
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,530
I'm going to try it!

459
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,810
I'm going to try it!

460
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,530
It's going to be delicious.

461
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,910
Moe moe cute!

462
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,750
I'm going to try it.

463
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:55,850
Let's eat.

464
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,500
It's so yummy.

465
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,800
You guys did a great job.

466
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,930
I'm swallowing?

467
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,680
Yeah, let's not do that again ever, huh?

468
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,400
Let's not do that again.

469
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,680
You guys...

470
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,700
You'll get there.

471
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,060
You'll get there, I promise.

472
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,020
Maybe.

473
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,540
You just need to hone your powers.

474
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,310
Yeah, this is why I'm the main.

475
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,130
She's blessing on my moe to like you.

476
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,970
Thanks for being the wind beneath our wings.

477
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,370
What's that song called?

478
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,750
Is that the song you're referencing?

479
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,970
Thank you, thank you.

480
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,130
Thank you for the spooky donut!

481
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,510
Ken-san super chat while I'm in Japan apparently.

482
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,330
I wanted to say the cafe was awesome!

483
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,290
I'm going to miss stream while I fly back to Canada today.

484
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,210
I'm going to save flight today!

485
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,910
I know you're always looking for 1-2 stream games.

486
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,730
I saw a silly one called Thank Goodness You're Here.

487
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,550
Wait, I think I've heard that one before.

488
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,310
Oh, trip?

489
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,050
Thank you so much!

490
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,170
Hi Minto!

491
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,630
You started affecting my wardrobe.

492
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,350
All my skirts are turning green as a pink enjoyer.

493
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,390
My coworkers keep saying, Green today?

494
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,670
When they see the green hair scrunchie.

495
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,710
Is this a virus?

496
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,850
Oh my gosh, this happened to me before too.

497
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,890
With my OSGs I started collecting their colors.

498
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,370
And then I turned mint.

499
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,650
Oh my god!

500
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,680
The mint-o-virus.

501
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,010
Thank you so much for the hunk of silver!

502
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,730
That's so cute though.

503
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,980
One second.

504
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,760
One second.

505
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,920
Hello, RXRouter!

506
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,500
Thank you so much for the 10th gifted.

507
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,920
Happy birthday again!

508
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,680
My, my, my!

509
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,680
Thanks for 10 months.

510
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,840
Sarah's gifted?

511
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,680
Thanks for the 10th gifted.

512
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,600
Chouken, welcome to membership.

513
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,560
Salty because of our tears.

514
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,280
That might have been what ruined it.

515
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,440
Not ruined it, sorry.

516
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,000
That might have been what added the zesty flavor.

517
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,530
Johnny, thanks for the 10th gifted!

518
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,170
Thank you.

519
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,370
Sorry, Freudian slip.

520
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,550
Okay, and...

521
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,830
Gochisousama deshita!

522
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,770
All done with my dinner!

523
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,170
Thank you guys for allowing me to eat.

524
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,650
Suddenly turned into like a Zatsudan watch along.

525
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,850
Takeshiro, thanks for the 10th gifted!

526
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,030
Thank you!

527
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,810
No, no, I said not ruined.

528
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,530
I don't need to wash my hands because I used a fork.

529
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,170
Now I gotta...

530
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,570
Open the game.

531
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,330
Now I gotta open the game.

532
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,770
Steam.

533
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,290
What's this game called?

534
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:24,990
Driving.

535
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,690
Actually, I...

536
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,930
Why did I decide to play this game on the same day that I got a car?

537
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,730
I'm so sick of cars.

538
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,170
Casey Raptor, thanks for the 5th gifted!

539
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,250
Thank you.

540
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,270
Remember last time we found a cat?

541
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,570
Yes, that's where we ended!

542
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,790
We ended on the...

543
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,790
Oh shoot, hold on.

544
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,210
Taro and I were supposed to talk tonight.

545
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,090
Yeah, we ended because...

546
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,570
After we did the cat quest.

547
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,830
And I had to go find a cat.

548
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,770
Sometimes you just feel like hitting the road, you know?

549
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,670
At least they don't try to upsell you on this car.

550
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,030
True!

551
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,950
Minty, your YouTube DVR is on.

552
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,010
No, no, I turned it off.

553
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,550
You just need to refresh your page.

554
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,290
DVR is off.

555
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,830
Watching some Minto before my operation?

556
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:40,790
Routine?

557
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,850
Wait, operation?

558
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,270
Operation?

559
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:45,930
Operation?

560
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,710
Are you okay?

561
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,230
Open game.

562
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,020
The music.

563
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,380
Oh god.

564
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,040
Wait, hold on.

565
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,320
Everything is almost up.

566
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,000
The game is all weird.

567
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,020
Hold on.

568
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm fixing it.

569
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,960
I'm fixing it.

570
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,700
Hold on.

571
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,540
I know you can't see anything.

572
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,080
You will, once I fix it.

573
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,040
Okay, hold on.

574
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,860
Then we go here.

575
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,220
Then we go game capture.

576
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,800
Then we do this.

577
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,240
And I got to get in a spot.

578
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,400
Where was I last time?

579
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,800
I think I was like...

580
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,960
Here?

581
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,780
About?

582
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,800
And then I can chop off my body.

583
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,320
Let me put my arms down.

584
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,840
Blasphemous.

585
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,520
Okay.

586
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,700
Sorry.

587
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,640
I can adjust.

588
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,420
Welcome everybody to Keep Driving!

589
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,840
You had that cute hat on last time.

590
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,420
I saw your tweet about that.

591
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,920
You like the sun hat, huh?

592
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,600
Wait.

593
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,480
How do I put it on?

594
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,900
It's like a little different.

595
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,360
Hold on.

596
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,860
I'm going to... Hold on.

597
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,080
I'll put it on.

598
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,520
Give me a second.

599
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,280
Give me a second.

600
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,700
A little gas money.

601
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,820
Oh, thank you friend!

602
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,160
Stalker?

603
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,380
No!

604
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,760
Only sometimes.

605
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,360
Wait, hold on.

606
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,860
I got to find my hat.

607
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,620
Crash, crash, tick, tick, tick, crash.

608
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,900
Don't mind the noise in the background.

609
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,380
Don't mind.

610
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,280
I'm just searching.

611
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,400
I'm going through my things.

612
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,360
Don't mind it.

613
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,780
Oh, my leg!

614
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,400
Oh, don't mind.

615
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,320
Hat.

616
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:26,760
Sorry.

617
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,340
I forgot what I was looking for.

618
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,740
What?

619
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,780
Oh, hold on.

620
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,500
Hold on.

621
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,980
Wait.

622
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:55,860
Anybody who is curious what's going on, don't even worry your pretty little head about it.

623
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,240
Okay?

624
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,800
All is well that...

625
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,480
Oh, no.

626
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,180
I messed up.

627
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:02,680
No!

628
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,540
All is well that ends well, I think.

629
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,240
Right?

630
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,280
That's the saying.

631
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,360
Hold on.

632
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,420
I found the wrong hat.

633
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,600
I got to start over.

634
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,340
I got to clear the entire neighborhood.

635
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,720
Crash, crash.

636
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,380
Oh, it's on fire!

637
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,060
Oh, my god.

638
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,180
I had a family.

639
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,760
Oh, my god.

640
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,720
I can't believe it's all gone.

641
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,800
It's all gone.

642
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,700
Except my hat.

643
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,360
It's definitely underneath this pile.

644
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,180
Oh, my god.

645
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,520
Oh, the humanity.

646
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,860
Why is god so cruel?

647
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,860
Oh, my god.

648
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,140
Oh, my god.

649
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,200
I'll never...

650
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,640
I'll never work in this town again.

651
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,220
I can't figure it out.

652
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,560
Hold on.

653
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,360
Hold on.

654
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,580
Oh!

655
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,780
I might have figured it out.

656
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,410
Good enough.

657
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,210
Yippee!

658
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:09,790
Okay.

659
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,390
The world has been burnt down for this hat.

660
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,350
I just got here.

661
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,010
What's going on?

662
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,070
Don't worry about it.

663
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,290
Yeah, don't worry about it.

664
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:27,890
Worse?

665
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:28,970
Really?

666
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:35,130
It's not... I don't think it looks as good as it did last time.

667
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,290
Sorry, because I'm on a...

668
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,330
I did it a little rushed, but you know.

669
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:42,410
Okay.

670
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:43,950
Keep driving.

671
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,190
Vroom, vroom.

672
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,250
We're continuing, baby, from the last time.

673
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,670
Oh.

674
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,650
How do I play this game again?

675
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,790
And we have...

676
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,710
We have a passenger and his dog.

677
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,630
That's right.

678
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,130
We have a passenger and his dog.

679
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,220
You drive the car.

680
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,820
And I have so much food!

681
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,100
We have a lot of food.

682
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,980
If I eat it...

683
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,380
Okay, we're tired.

684
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,020
And we're so show.

685
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,700
How's the audio, by the way?

686
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,600
Feel free to speak up if it's bad.

687
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,620
We have skill points and I haven't really used them.

688
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,560
What does it do?

689
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,400
Hold my beer.

690
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,240
How am I supposed to see what it does?

691
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,620
Oh, right click to see details.

692
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,480
I can read.

693
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:56,780
A little loud?

694
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,620
Is that better?

695
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,660
Changes target with... Okay, I'm starting to remember.

696
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,340
Remove all armor.

697
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,220
Destroy one threat.

698
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,560
For each armor lost.

699
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,840
What's this one?

700
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,680
Remove one threat.

701
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,480
Each skill used this event.

702
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,240
10 cash!

703
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,300
If you get a perfect with this skill, restore 1 use to all skills and gain 10 cash.

704
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,240
Oh, it costs cash but also you gain the cash.

705
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,480
Incredibly important.

706
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,520
Press space.

707
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,720
Space?

708
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,760
Get out of my way!

709
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,780
1 gas.

710
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,020
3 uses.

711
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,060
1 energy.

712
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,580
If you get a perfect with this skill, gain 1 gas.

713
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,280
I have so many...

714
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,700
I don't know.

715
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,600
Everything doesn't seem like it's so good.

716
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,280
Am I crazy?

717
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,140
Am I crazy?

718
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,700
I do have a good amount of money but...

719
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,480
Maybe this one.

720
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,320
Get a perfect.

721
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,640
Adapt has infinite uses.

722
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,640
Which one is Adapt?

723
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:33,860
Adapt.

724
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,540
Drive fast.

725
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,780
Adapt.

726
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,120
Oh yeah, it does.

727
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,580
Costs 0 energy.

728
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,680
Change targets with current... Oh, this one.

729
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,060
Adapt.

730
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,950
Eco driving under driving.

731
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,410
We're good in my experience.

732
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,990
Eco driving.

733
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,750
3 uses.

734
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,890
Costs 1 energy.

735
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:06,910
You know what?

736
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:07,210
Why not?

737
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,770
But I don't have space.

738
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,610
I'll just have it for now.

739
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,190
So, we just...

740
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,830
We just...

741
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,510
finished something.

742
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,830
We finished the cat.

743
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:33,710
And...

744
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,010
We're all the way in Fardorf.

745
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,290
That's craziness.

746
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:41,830
We gotta get all the way...

747
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,470
over to the festival.

748
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,950
There's a lot going on here.

749
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,330
We're two towns in.

750
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,650
I wish I could zoom in and out.

751
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,230
Yeah, we're literally...

752
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:56,610
home.

753
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:01,470
Fardorf.

754
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,210
But I'm gonna actually sleep.

755
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,730
So that we can be all rested and well.

756
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:16,070
Especially when we get ambushed on the streets.

757
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,170
Wow, we got a lot of things.

758
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,030
We're cold.

759
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,630
Okay, hold on.

760
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:26,210
Enter the food.

761
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,990
We can probably get a hot coffee.

762
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,050
And use.

763
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:32,850
Nice.

764
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,030
And eat a berry.

765
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,690
And we're fine now.

766
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,270
How about...

767
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,450
We do also have other...

768
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,890
Sorry, I keep going to the journal.

769
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:50,910
We have other things.

770
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,310
The great race.

771
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,090
Install a roll cage.

772
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:54,730
Get to the race.

773
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:55,330
Enter the race.

774
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:55,930
Punk club.

775
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,510
Go to the eastern city and find the club.

776
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,010
Oh, this is right.

777
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,230
Our grandma is dying.

778
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,430
I don't think we're gonna make it to her in time.

779
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,800
Race and inheritance are endings?

780
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,320
Well, we're definitely missing that one.

781
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,500
Let's get to the punk club.

782
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,480
Eastern city.

783
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,070
We're losing out on all the money.

784
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:23,590
No worries.

785
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:27,770
Eastern...

786
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,430
There's the race track.

787
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,030
Eastern city.

788
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:33,990
Oh my gosh.

789
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,930
This is what my mouse is doing, you guys.

790
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:36,430
You see this?

791
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:38,910
Meadows town.

792
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,050
I think this is where grandma is.

793
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,790
Rest in peace, grandma.

794
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,870
Oh my god, I can't track.

795
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,550
You see this?

796
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,270
Something's really wrong with my mouse recently.

797
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,990
Where is eastern city?

798
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,990
This is on the west, so I imagine it's on the east.

799
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,270
Thanks Ducky!

800
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:25,150
Can you click the map in the log?

801
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:27,930
Let's try it.

802
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,520
Go to the eastern...

803
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,200
Oh, there we go.

804
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,740
Oh, it's Hongad.

805
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,620
Okay, we gotta go all the way over there.

806
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,330
I guess it doesn't really matter.

807
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,210
We can go to Hongad.

808
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:01,190
Werewolf Aso.

809
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,470
Just unplugging the dongle once fixed it.

810
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:07,690
Maybe I need to do that.

811
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,930
Because I don't imagine it would break while I wasn't using it in Japan, you know?

812
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,050
Wouldn't that be so silly?

813
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,910
Oh, Hitchhiker Argument.

814
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:21,150
Dang it, I got so excited.

815
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,670
Why are we always fighting?

816
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,350
I think we need to kick this guy out.

817
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,090
I think we need to kick him out.

818
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,380
Can we keep the dog?

819
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,600
That might be the source.

820
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:51,840
Ouch.

821
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,300
There's a door, yeah.

822
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,080
I'm opening it up.

823
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,740
I'm kicking his butt out.

824
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,000
I do like the dog though.

825
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,500
I would like to keep him.

826
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,840
Warzoi.

827
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:17,980
What?

828
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,060
Oh my god!

829
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,100
Guys, we are in trouble.

830
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:28,880
Wait.

831
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,620
Guys, I'm a little scared.

832
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,900
Oh no, my mouse is making it hard.

833
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,840
Ok, there we go.

834
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,400
Add one durability threat.

835
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,140
Oh my god, they are surrounding us.

836
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,740
What do we do?

837
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,520
Oh, let's see, hold on.

838
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,080
Oh, thank goodness it worked.

839
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,680
You're scared.

840
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,460
I'm stressed, I'm stressing.

841
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,480
Please, please pick up.

842
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,100
There we go.

843
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:13,760
And...

844
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,140
I don't think this will... This one adapts forever though.

845
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,720
We did it!

846
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,940
Holy moly.

847
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,110
That stressed me out.

848
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:34,170
Hold over by car.

849
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,090
Why is the world...

850
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,070
Officer, thank goodness you're here.

851
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,530
I was just surrounded by a biker gang.

852
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,030
Please officer, you have to help me.

853
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,530
You have to help me.

854
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,150
Officer, officer, I'm innocent.

855
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:56,630
Officer, I'm innocent.

856
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,970
You have to help me.

857
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,670
Something tells me I'm gonna owe a lot of money.

858
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,300
What does the punk do?

859
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,780
Oh yeah, that's a good... Oh my gosh, please!

860
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,620
Oh my gosh!

861
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,620
You guys can see how bad my mouse is in full force here.

862
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,480
Remove left and right most threat.

863
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,760
Incur a random negative status.

864
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,160
Remove three random threats!

865
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,180
Of course he keeps the money.

866
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,660
Wait, does this cost anything?

867
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,660
Did this cost anything?

868
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,560
Ghost needs a new mouse.

869
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,720
Oh, it costs one gas.

870
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,600
What does the dog do?

871
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,020
I just spent so much on a car.

872
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,780
I don't want to get a mouse too.

873
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:04,850
Let me see...

874
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,030
My car... Not my car.

875
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,170
My mouse is hardwired right now.

876
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,510
Let me see, hold on.

877
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,130
I'm being introspective.

878
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,990
I hope I never become a commuter.

879
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,810
But I hope I become responsible.

880
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,530
But I hope I don't become boring.

881
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,230
But I hope I'll be happy.

882
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,470
Don't close your eyes on the road.

883
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,030
Or maybe.

884
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:38,090
What happens?

885
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:40,970
Two seconds go by.

886
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,490
They feel long and frightening.

887
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,050
Then you open them again.

888
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:49,850
That was scary.

889
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:53,490
Hi man, thank you for almost a year.

890
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:54,030
Thank you!

891
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,350
Thank you for being around for 11 months.

892
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,350
Speed cameras, what the heck.

893
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:01,850
This is like the longest road ever.

894
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,790
Hi Mito, yesterday I sent a bamboo ship saying it was my birthday.

895
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,970
And if you missed it, that's totally fine.

896
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,570
I think I did, I'm so sorry.

897
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:09,750
Matusi.

898
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,850
I was wondering if I did something wrong.

899
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:13,710
Oh, no.

900
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,030
No, it wasn't you.

901
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,510
It's not you, it's me.

902
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:21,990
But of course, let me get through this and then I'll wish you a happy birthday.

903
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,930
Happy birthday to you.

904
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,410
Happy birthday to you.

905
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:34,050
Happy birthday dear Matusi.

906
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,490
I hope I'm saying your name right.

907
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,890
Happy birthday to you.

908
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,510
Moose... Oh, I thought that said moose fun.

909
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,590
But your name is Invisible Moose.

910
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,630
I thought it was a moose fun.

911
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,510
Hold on, let me unplug my dongle.

912
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,790
Thank you for the pings!

913
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,010
Thank you!

914
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,940
The punk has reached level 3.

915
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,140
Moose fun.

916
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,580
I wonder if the roads get longer.

917
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,980
Like, the more you play.

918
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:32,590
End zone.

919
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,970
Oh, we got a social.

920
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,070
We upgraded our social link.

921
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,650
The merch I bought finally came in!

922
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,610
I need suggestions on where to put the sticker I got.

923
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,290
The sticker is of a rear view.

924
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,130
Well, clearly I'm in the car then, right?

925
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:48,390
Welcome back.

926
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:48,950
Thanks, Goa!

927
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,520
Restore one use to each hitchhiker skill.

928
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,460
Oh, I'm gonna get that.

929
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,200
Actually, I don't have any space.

930
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,180
I'm so silly.

931
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,400
Hold on.

932
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,240
Let's go.

933
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,540
Oh wait, it's our guy.

934
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,260
He's right there.

935
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,780
Talk to him.

936
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,140
Try playing this sometime.

937
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,420
It's by this local band.

938
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:34,520
Mundane.

939
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,980
He literally just gave me his mixtape.

940
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,920
He just gave me his mixtape.

941
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,880
Oh man, we have such a lame...

942
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,260
We have such a lame hitchhiker.

943
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:01,000
I was gonna say friend, but this guy is definitely more foe than friend.

944
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,600
Find an item.

945
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:03,800
Wait.

946
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,820
I don't think...

947
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,460
We are in the spooky woods.

948
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,700
Into the woods.

949
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,120
Slenderman doko.

950
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,280
Collect 8 pages.

951
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,900
That would be terrifying if it was just like...

952
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,220
Hey, by the way.

953
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,120
Collect 8 pages.

954
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,960
Too scary.

955
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,160
Why are there so many abandoned...

956
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,340
I think it's the abandoned tent that scares me the most.

957
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,100
Does that not freak you guys out?

958
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,420
It's definitely a dead person's tent.

959
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,960
Why else would you leave it?

960
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,060
Is that everything?

961
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,460
We didn't go this way.

962
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,780
Now this looks modern and well taken care of.

963
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,720
Watch your energy.

964
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,820
Oh my gosh.

965
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:13,640
Sorry.

966
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,140
Thank you.

967
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,020
I just noticed it.

968
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,060
Yay.

969
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,660
What did we get?

970
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,200
Cool shades!

971
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,570
We got some skirts.

972
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:31,810
Skirts, skirts.

973
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,330
We got some more ciggies.

974
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,310
We got caffeine.

975
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,550
Caffeine pills.

976
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:39,110
Pills here.

977
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:41,690
Scrap.

978
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,750
We're gonna sell that.

979
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:45,090
Spilled beer.

980
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,010
We'll sell that.

981
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,130
Wine.

982
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,390
I'm definitely not using that.

983
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,150
I've learned my lesson.

984
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:52,150
And a rope.

985
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,410
Probably from that...

986
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:00,610
From that one camp.

987
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:03,970
Oh, here we go.

988
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,050
Awesome.

989
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:12,830
From the one tent.

990
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,230
Took the day off for road tripping with a vehicle.

991
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,310
No, why would you do that?

992
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,610
Oh, here's a...

993
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,630
Looking for an extra with a black car.

994
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:27,910
I don't have a black car.

995
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:32,150
Is there a car shop here?

996
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,790
We could maybe make our car black.

997
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:38,910
I'm selling the wine.

998
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:39,610
I don't care.

999
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,310
Wait, the skirt seems pretty good, no?

1000
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,190
Nice teaspoon.

1001
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:51,570
Wait, what does this do?

1002
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,850
Increases durability by 2.

1003
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,390
This is so much better.

1004
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,160
There we go.

1005
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:02,800
Yeah!

1006
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,680
Increases durability.

1007
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:08,420
We get the durability and we get the gas increase.

1008
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:08,900
Nice.

1009
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,720
In fact, I'm just gonna sell this one then.

1010
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,280
The fender?

1011
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:14,000
Goodbye.

1012
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,180
Oh, wait.

1013
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,740
Goodbye.

1014
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,920
We could do!

1015
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,280
We could make our car black.

1016
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,760
And then we could do that side quest.

1017
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,280
Nice boost.

1018
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,480
Nice, nice.

1019
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:34,460
Hmm...

1020
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,820
I think my car was okay.

1021
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:49,820
So...

1022
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,140
Did you get paid for the sponsorship side quest?

1023
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:53,460
Yes!

1024
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,100
Yes, so I honestly... I think it would be okay then.

1025
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,840
Black spray...

1026
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,220
Customize and...

1027
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:04,800
This, right?

1028
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,560
Wait, how do I use it?

1029
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:08,880
Do it.

1030
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,280
Oh, here.

1031
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,900
I guess we can take this off then too.

1032
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,060
The energy drink.

1033
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:15,740
Nice.

1034
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,480
Okay, modders might let you away to drive, Itasha.

1035
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,980
That would be so awesome.

1036
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,460
What's this?

1037
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:23,680
Oh.

1038
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,280
This is our only one, so...

1039
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:29,840
Except...

1040
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,260
Have a black car.

1041
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,380
That's what we got, baby.

1042
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,260
I don't need any more food.

1043
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,460
But...

1044
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,100
A hot tea would be nice.

1045
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,820
My energy is...

1046
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,080
Probably...

1047
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,640
Probably next place will...

1048
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:49,780
Will...

1049
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,840
Do more...

1050
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,680
Oh, awesome!

1051
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,460
We are on the way!

1052
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,520
Here we gotta go to the R64, so we just gotta go down that way.

1053
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,280
Wait, R77.

1054
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,140
Is that the next one?

1055
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:03,460
Yes.

1056
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:04,660
Let's go.

1057
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,760
Nice.

1058
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,400
Looks like a Yakuza card.

1059
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:11,840
What?

1060
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,060
I was reading an interesting book.

1061
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:19,560
It was about a gorilla explaining the woes of humanity.

1062
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:25,360
Or at least civilized humanity and how we just don't know how to live.

1063
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,500
How should we live?

1064
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:28,980
I don't know.

1065
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,460
I haven't finished it.

1066
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:35,620
But I think we are supposed to live more primitively or something.

1067
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,620
I'm way ahead of you.

1068
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:48,710
Artoons?

1069
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:52,970
Flat tire?

1070
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,890
No.

1071
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,850
Hold on.

1072
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:04,970
I think...

1073
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,970
I think if I do this...

1074
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:09,050
Nice.

1075
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,050
And then this.

1076
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:13,390
Oh my gosh.

1077
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,090
My mouse, you guys.

1078
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:15,770
This is so bad.

1079
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:17,430
I really like my mouse too.

1080
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:18,590
I don't want it to be...

1081
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,030
I don't want it to be dead.

1082
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:26,450
Flat tire for the flat ghost.

1083
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,890
I, I, I...

1084
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:34,890
But also I just realized we are going to have to sleep because we are going to lose our...

1085
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:36,910
Our other abilities and all.

1086
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:43,390
Remove left and right most threat.

1087
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:44,830
I mean...

1088
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:46,050
Three random threat.

1089
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:50,630
Oh, let's do...

1090
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,030
Oh, I was going to say let's do the cigarette.

1091
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:52,610
I'm stupid.

1092
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,370
This is such a cool roguelike.

1093
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:58,650
Right?

1094
01:01:58,850 --> 01:01:59,390
It's fun.

1095
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,490
It's really neat.

1096
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:06,410
I don't know which one to... I don't know what to do.

1097
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:11,070
Maybe your mouse ball is all gumped up.

1098
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,410
My mouse ball?

1099
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,070
Sorry, I was blowing in it.

1100
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,230
I was blowing in the hole.

1101
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:24,430
No, my mouse is pretty new.

1102
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:31,070
Check out darkest dungeon.

1103
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:33,090
Is that actually a chill game?

1104
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,570
I think I'm going to do this one because we have two left on it.

1105
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:44,250
I think we'll have one left on it and then we'll have the other one.

1106
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:46,810
Sorry about the smell.

1107
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:50,050
This...

1108
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,990
It's not chill.

1109
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:53,550
I was going to say, I don't think it is.

1110
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,710
How do I put on the tunes?

1111
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:56,230
Oh, music.

1112
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:56,750
Here we go.

1113
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:58,330
Eject.

1114
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:00,790
And then we got mundane.

1115
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,100
I think I remember liking the west... west whatever.

1116
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:09,900
Play.

1117
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,470
Abandoned... Oh, we can get something from this.

1118
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,030
This is good.

1119
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:21,790
It might have loot.

1120
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:22,990
Nice, nice, nice.

1121
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:32,190
Nice.

1122
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,660
This adapt is actually so good.

1123
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,620
Adapt is actually so good.

1124
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,980
And we have so many cigarettes.

1125
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,260
I don't mind using them.

1126
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,640
I have a smoking problem maybe.

1127
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,560
West coast literally means west coast by the way.

1128
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,000
Oh, I learned.

1129
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:09,900
Suspension.

1130
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:13,100
And some more scrap we can sell.

1131
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,460
We'll rotate you.

1132
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,820
And stick you right in there.

1133
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:20,820
Nice.

1134
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:23,380
Nice.

1135
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,460
Nice, nice, nice.

1136
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,960
Those things will kill me with the smokes?

1137
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,180
No, I'm gonna eat them.

1138
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,260
I'm gonna have them in my tummy.

1139
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,240
That's what I learned from Metal Gear.

1140
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,080
We'll stop.

1141
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:39,860
Is that a woman?

1142
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:41,480
Hey!

1143
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,200
Wow!

1144
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,160
You're not an old trucker.

1145
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,460
Where are you going?

1146
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:47,800
You got room for me?

1147
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,220
I'm just sort of traveling around.

1148
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,840
Look out!

1149
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:04,980
Put her in the back.

1150
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,240
I have too many berries.

1151
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,940
Do you think she'd be fine next to the porn?

1152
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,020
I think she and the dog could share a seat, no?

1153
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,360
Wait.

1154
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:19,910
Wait.

1155
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,530
I have too many berries.

1156
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,430
I have too many berries.

1157
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:33,430
Oh no.

1158
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,630
I can't make room for women.

1159
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:36,950
I have too many berries.

1160
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,330
Mambo, do you mind holding all my berries?

1161
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,790
Eat them or sell them?

1162
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:49,790
Even still, I don't think we'll have room, no?

1163
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:52,490
I can't tell.

1164
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:53,730
We have a lot of pizza.

1165
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:59,390
What do I do with all my berries?

1166
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:00,990
I don't want to waste food.

1167
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:01,990
Food or...

1168
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,310
What does she even do?

1169
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:05,570
Oh wow!

1170
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,010
Basic targeting skill.

1171
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:11,430
Become inspired and tired.

1172
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,570
She's flirting with me.

1173
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:21,670
What do I do?

1174
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:22,630
Wow!

1175
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:23,410
Damn!

1176
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:24,990
Thank you so much for the hocus pocus.

1177
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:26,610
Oh my gosh!

1178
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,630
Thank you for singing Orange the other day.

1179
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,910
It's one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite shows.

1180
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:32,390
Me too!

1181
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:35,510
I've been sick all week, but watching you has made me feel a lot better.

1182
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,370
Today is my birthday!

1183
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,610
I wanted to treat myself by treating you.

1184
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,270
Yasashii sekai!

1185
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,410
What the heck.

1186
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,170
Thank you!

1187
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,650
Of course, I will sing happy birthday for you too!

1188
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:57,230
Happy birthday to you.

1189
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:00,170
Happy birthday to you.

1190
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,190
Happy birthday dear Tim.

1191
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:10,310
Happy birthday and feel better.

1192
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:12,290
Happy birthday!

1193
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,690
Thank you so much.

1194
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:18,830
You should be spoiling yourself.

1195
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,550
If you like west coast, I can recommend you Tokyo Shoe Gazer.

1196
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:23,150
Oh my gosh!

1197
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:27,970
I know it's kind of memed upon, but I unironically like Shoe Gazer.

1198
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:31,290
Okay, we'll eat the berries, you guys.

1199
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:32,150
We'll eat our berries.

1200
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:36,110
Do you think we're gonna get a status effect that is tummy ache?

1201
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:38,110
Oh no!

1202
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,250
I ate too many berries.

1203
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:41,730
Tummy hurt.

1204
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,790
Tummy hurt, too many berries.

1205
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,260
Oh no!

1206
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:52,980
Oh no!

1207
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:53,440
Wait.

1208
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,900
Hold on, we're almost there.

1209
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:01,220
What?

1210
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,880
I thought I was able to...

1211
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,760
Oh wait, I think I still...

1212
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,540
Hold on.

1213
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:07,640
Dude.

1214
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,080
Guys, I don't know if it's possible.

1215
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,240
The radiator.

1216
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:20,650
Goodbye, chips.

1217
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:23,450
Hello?

1218
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:24,890
No!

1219
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:26,890
Wait, no!

1220
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,990
Let's move everything up.

1221
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,130
And free up this seat instead.

1222
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:34,530
Why won't it lift?

1223
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:37,110
Right click to raise.

1224
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:39,950
I couldn't read.

1225
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,010
I couldn't read.

1226
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,650
Alright, let's accept woman.

1227
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,810
Alright, nice.

1228
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:57,470
We're all good!

1229
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,570
Let's take a choco in the...

1230
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:00,750
Oh, in the glove box.

1231
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:01,550
Where are you headed anyway?

1232
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:03,310
Gonna meet some friends.

1233
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,870
Cool, me too.

1234
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,960
Oh, what's happening?

1235
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,600
In the zone.

1236
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,900
We are also...

1237
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,440
I'm sorry, did that just say hungry?

1238
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,900
You liar of a game!

1239
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,960
We are not hungry.

1240
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,660
I ate so many berries!

1241
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:32,290
That is such a lie!

1242
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,710
That's an absolute lie.

1243
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:38,490
Canned beans!

1244
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,970
Alright, now we can sell off some of this stuff though.

1245
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,790
So that's good.

1246
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:45,850
Let's sell off our scrap.

1247
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,650
Let's sell off this...

1248
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,530
Oh, not the beans.

1249
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:53,670
I might have to get like a new mouse tomorrow.

1250
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:55,270
Maybe I'll order something, I don't know.

1251
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,490
The berries were so good you got hungry?

1252
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,570
I guess it's not like a full meal, huh?

1253
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:03,070
I'm gonna sell my monster energy.

1254
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:05,990
Radiator.

1255
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:08,410
What is this?

1256
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:09,350
Oh, bandage!

1257
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:12,070
I don't really understand...

1258
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:14,650
Oh, removes threat warnings.

1259
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:17,030
Fruit candy.

1260
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,410
In fact, I'm gonna buy the bandages.

1261
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:20,350
I think that might be handy.

1262
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:22,450
Oh, what's this?

1263
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,490
Makes you immune to the stress status.

1264
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:26,830
Ooh!

1265
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:32,870
I like my mouse so much though.

1266
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:33,910
I'll troubleshoot it.

1267
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:35,110
I'll troubleshoot it.

1268
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:45,110
I feel like I have to start getting rid of some of these...

1269
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,890
Some of these...

1270
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:53,530
Things that I probably am not gonna use.

1271
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,830
Like some of these mechanic stuff.

1272
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:01,470
Did you rhyme on purpose?

1273
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,470
I rhymed?

1274
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,030
I'm just a genius.

1275
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:07,730
Don't you know that already?

1276
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:09,270
Don't you know that by now?

1277
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,810
So much food and still hunger.

1278
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,730
I ate the banana, no?

1279
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:19,970
Aspirin.

1280
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,350
We have two things of aspirin.

1281
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,090
We got two jerry cans.

1282
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:24,230
Oh, wait.

1283
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:26,570
I could use this.

1284
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:29,530
And now we can sell it.

1285
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:32,590
So that gives us a little bit more room too.

1286
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:33,830
That gives us a little bit more room.

1287
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,730
Let's see.

1288
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:39,630
I don't think there was a mechanic in this town, so...

1289
01:11:40,150 --> 01:11:41,590
But we have a little bit of space.

1290
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:44,890
You're gonna sell the doujin?

1291
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:45,330
No!

1292
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,630
These are my prized possessions.

1293
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,750
I just realized also, I'm so sorry you guys.

1294
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,090
My head has been like so in the way.

1295
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,610
Oh, we can sell our sunglasses.

1296
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:56,950
But they're kinda cool.

1297
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:01,960
I don't wanna sell them.

1298
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:03,400
Let's check.

1299
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,840
Yeah, I was right.

1300
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,600
There's only...

1301
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,500
There's only a gas station.

1302
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:22,180
18 bucks?

1303
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:22,620
Sure.

1304
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:23,700
We're about to get paid.

1305
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,860
We're on the road...

1306
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,380
to...

1307
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:33,820
R64.

1308
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,620
Another birthday!

1309
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:42,440
Oh my goodness.

1310
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,060
It's my friend's birthday today.

1311
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,440
Can you wish Daniel a happy birthday?

1312
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,120
Of course!

1313
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,720
Happy birthday to you.

1314
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,800
Happy birthday to you.

1315
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,660
Happy birthday, damn Daniel.

1316
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,920
Happy birthday to you.

1317
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,740
Happy birthday!

1318
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,880
Speaking of doujin, would you know where I can buy Ayami-sensei's books during my trip to Japan?

1319
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,420
You could go to Melon Books if they have any.

1320
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:23,860
Or you could go to places that have used doujinshi.

1321
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,880
And see if there's anything there.

1322
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:31,380
Though those places are kinda hard to look through because they don't really sort by anything.

1323
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,600
So...

1324
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,060
Might be kinda difficult.

1325
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,780
Driving on the motorway sure is monotonous.

1326
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,900
I'm looking forward to seeing something new.

1327
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:46,680
It could be anything!

1328
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,140
Could be.

1329
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:56,060
Yeah guys, I gotta use doujin sometimes.

1330
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,040
Flat tire again.

1331
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,810
I say used, but it's like...

1332
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:09,490
How to describe?

1333
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:13,090
It's like...

1334
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:15,810
It's like a...

1335
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:19,820
It's more like a...

1336
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,320
It doesn't always mean that it's been opened.

1337
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,380
Yeah, second hand.

1338
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,040
Pre-owned!

1339
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:30,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1340
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,700
Pre-owned.

1341
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,000
What does lady do?

1342
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,500
Oh that's right, we become inspired and tired.

1343
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,260
I like this song a lot.

1344
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,060
This is this one.

1345
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,480
And this one.

1346
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,520
Oh, this might be a mistake, but we'll see.

1347
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:06,600
Detroit!

1348
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:06,960
Detroit!

1349
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,260
Why are you guys spoiling me so much today?

1350
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:10,880
What is happening?

1351
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,840
Thank you for the birthday gift!

1352
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,560
Thank you!

1353
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:15,960
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1354
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:18,880
Why?

1355
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,780
Oh, more introspection.

1356
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,840
How did my fingernails get so dirty?

1357
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,000
I guess I've been scratching my head again.

1358
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,600
I don't care.

1359
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:28,620
I don't care!

1360
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,940
You look at the road and stop thinking about your nails.

1361
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:38,330
Oh, we're already here.

1362
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:39,790
We got to the set.

1363
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:40,330
Nice.

1364
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:43,210
Hello!

1365
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:45,990
Wow, that is just the kind of car we need.

1366
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:50,310
Yippee!

1367
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:52,910
We got paid, baby.

1368
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:53,770
We got paid.

1369
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,190
There's not much here either.

1370
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,190
Ducky, they give her the five gift.

1371
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:01,390
Thank you!

1372
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,350
I kind of want this steering wheel sleeve.

1373
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:05,750
What is this?

1374
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:06,510
Oh, beer case.

1375
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:07,350
No, no, no!

1376
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:08,350
Don't do it.

1377
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:17,030
I think my current cool shades are cooler than these cool shades.

1378
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,270
Beer clock.

1379
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:20,570
No!

1380
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:24,810
That ruined... That ended... That killed the run before!

1381
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:28,170
That's what killed our run.

1382
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:32,910
I wish the rotating was not as bad.

1383
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:36,150
Because I clearly can rotate it.

1384
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:37,750
You just don't want to.

1385
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:39,390
No!

1386
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:40,430
We don't need anything.

1387
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:42,290
Let's upgrade.

1388
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,950
Oh, here.

1389
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,410
Yeah, we need to go there.

1390
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:46,810
But it's funny.

1391
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:48,970
Do it for the heehee.

1392
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:50,390
Do it for the haha.

1393
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,210
Sell the magazines?

1394
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,190
No, they're for me.

1395
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:56,210
They're for myself.

1396
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:57,750
Cute.

1397
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:00,690
Ah, me baby.

1398
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:01,910
My precious.

1399
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,590
Only one way to go.

1400
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:08,610
Kotsuke!

1401
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,670
Can we see?

1402
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,960
I'm gonna move over just a little bit too.

1403
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,640
What else will we do?

1404
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,000
Oh wait, I was gonna sleep here.

1405
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,380
That's right.

1406
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:29,700
Hold on.

1407
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,520
Not leave, not leave.

1408
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:31,820
Zoom.

1409
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:33,940
I was gonna sleep.

1410
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:39,320
What else would we do on the road if we didn't have our magazines, you know?

1411
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,780
Eat the banana.

1412
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:48,660
Alright.

1413
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,360
We're set to go baby.

1414
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,080
Let's go.

1415
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,600
How has it almost been a year?

1416
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,480
I don't know.

1417
01:17:58,540 --> 01:17:59,920
I can't believe it.

1418
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,940
I've seen fairies.

1419
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,880
They had wispy white hair and rode on frogs.

1420
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,340
I'm not a fairy.

1421
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,140
I'm a ghost by the way.

1422
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,440
In case you were wondering.

1423
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:25,720
Fallen tree?

1424
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,900
Oh my gosh, I think that does not just... Everybody's driving.

1425
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,940
Just everybody's driving through it.

1426
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:35,840
Oh wow.

1427
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,240
Wowee, wowee.

1428
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,360
Let's do this one.

1429
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:46,640
Do that and then I'm gonna use his skill and we're gonna remove three random threats.

1430
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:48,640
And that.

1431
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,380
Oh, I was gonna say that should be it but it wasn't.

1432
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,960
Fairies aren't real.

1433
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,940
Yeah, fairies aren't real.

1434
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,640
What does this symbol mean again?

1435
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,320
I don't remember.

1436
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,200
I don't remember.

1437
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:17,290
Music one, clear adjacent threats.

1438
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:18,210
Oh, thank you.

1439
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:19,710
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1440
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:26,290
This would be a perfect game to teach you about managed stress while driving.

1441
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:29,190
Alcohol, gambling apps, road rage, the good stuff.

1442
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:32,210
What gambling apps are you... What are you playing?

1443
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:34,410
Oh, hitchhiker argument.

1444
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,930
I was gonna say another hitchhiker.

1445
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,090
Oh, come on you guys.

1446
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,670
Guys, we were in the groove, no?

1447
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,470
We were in the groove.

1448
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:50,230
Why are you guys arguing?

1449
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:02,530
I'm inspired.

1450
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:03,990
Oh, and I'm tired.

1451
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:08,940
Goodbye cigarettes.

1452
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,760
I really like this music.

1453
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,780
Flat tire.

1454
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:35,950
Let's also go into my... Oh, I can't go into my trunk, can I?

1455
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:36,530
Oopsie.

1456
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:49,710
Nice.

1457
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:51,290
Ouchie ouch.

1458
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:53,890
The dog has abilities now too?

1459
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:55,050
Wait, serious?

1460
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,780
Oh, my bark!

1461
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:09,350
Red Carpenter, Turbo Killer would be my road trip music at night.

1462
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:10,770
I've never heard it.

1463
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:18,950
My road trip music is, at night especially, is a lot of Yuru Meru Mori songs.

1464
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:20,330
Have you ever heard of them?

1465
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,610
They're an idol group.

1466
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:28,590
I don't... They're still around technically, but I don't really listen to their new lineup of people.

1467
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:32,170
But...

1468
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:38,670
They kind of have... Some of their songs have a bit of a shoegazy vibe, which I like.

1469
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:40,650
I like the dog.

1470
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:45,250
Oh, we can stay here.

1471
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:46,890
We can stay at a nice hotel.

1472
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:48,710
What else is here?

1473
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,010
We can explore in the dark.

1474
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:52,270
Oh, here we go.

1475
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:53,090
Customize.

1476
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:54,970
Alrighty.

1477
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,850
What things do we got?

1478
01:21:59,090 --> 01:21:59,770
Suspension.

1479
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,910
I already have a suspension.

1480
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:05,550
Double the effect of your equipped wheels.

1481
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:08,590
So I'm gonna sell this one.

1482
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:14,530
Need it to be able to drive.

1483
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:19,230
Remove one cash threat.

1484
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:20,650
Remove one gas threat.

1485
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,610
Remove one durability threat.

1486
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:27,890
Do we want to have more armor, or do we want to remove a threat?

1487
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:30,930
Either seems pretty nice, not gonna lie.

1488
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:36,770
We'll keep the rope, because I don't know what we need it for, but...

1489
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:40,530
This thing reduces gas drained on motorways.

1490
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:45,610
This one technically I guess gives... Actually...

1491
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:47,670
Armor is good all around.

1492
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:50,810
Yeah, it gives us technically two armor, so it's even better.

1493
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:54,610
And then... radiator.

1494
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:56,830
Where does this go into?

1495
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,130
Oh, where our skirt is.

1496
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:01,920
Which I think I'm just gonna sell the radiator, because...

1497
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:04,430
The skirt is too good.

1498
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:06,810
Goodbye radiator.

1499
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,190
And then the heater.

1500
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:12,270
That goes there.

1501
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:13,040
This is...

1502
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:15,850
More durability and protects against sunlight.

1503
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,590
I think I'll sell this too.

1504
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:24,210
We won't get cold.

1505
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:26,490
Just put on a jacket, duh.

1506
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:31,310
I'll keep the exhaust pipe for now.

1507
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,600
Discount at gas stations.

1508
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,660
I'm selling stuff.

1509
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:44,900
I'm making room.

1510
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,500
Your shades already do that.

1511
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:50,360
What, the sunlight?

1512
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:51,380
Oh.

1513
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,220
Oh, we get the two more durability.

1514
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,180
That's big.

1515
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,020
That's big.

1516
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:02,320
And look how big these are for me.

1517
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,540
Superliminal, thank you so much for the 10 gifts!

1518
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:07,440
Thank you.

1519
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1520
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,220
Thank you for being a friend.

1521
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,660
I'm back again.

1522
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:22,540
This should be okay.

1523
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:23,380
Probably.

1524
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:25,700
Probably.

1525
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,180
Oh.

1526
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,420
Yeah, probably.

1527
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:29,860
Probably.

1528
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,440
How many more do I have?

1529
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,100
Four out of six.

1530
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,040
Okay, we're good on that.

1531
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,800
Golden Minky.

1532
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:38,800
Let's go exploring.

1533
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,220
This seems not very safe.

1534
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,300
This is not very safe at all.

1535
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,020
I used the rope to climb!

1536
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,140
That's what it's for!

1537
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,800
Oh, wow.

1538
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:54,900
Oh.

1539
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:58,920
Interesting.

1540
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,280
Oh, there's like nothing here though.

1541
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,200
I imagine it's not a one-time use.

1542
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:16,310
Snake eater.

1543
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,890
What do you mean by that?

1544
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:23,690
Because we're in the Russian jungles?

1545
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:27,470
It's permanent?

1546
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:28,110
Awesome.

1547
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:35,670
Wow, this area is humungo.

1548
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:39,610
I won't get lost.

1549
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:43,170
We're even going through caves in the dark?

1550
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,450
Are we insane?

1551
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,470
I'm watching my energy.

1552
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:49,830
We're gonna go to sleep after this, so it should be okay.

1553
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:52,790
Minus one energy.

1554
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:54,930
Wait, I did this one.

1555
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,270
Is there a jump scare?

1556
01:25:58,450 --> 01:25:59,730
No, I don't think so.

1557
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:01,190
We haven't gotten one yet.

1558
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,070
I'm officially lost.

1559
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:08,510
Nevermind, I'm a genius.

1560
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,210
A camera!

1561
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:14,650
Camera filters.

1562
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:22,130
Potato chips from the jungle.

1563
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,470
What

1564
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,120
do I do with this?

1565
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,280
It sells for 45.

1566
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:55,540
If I use this, they will know probably, right?

1567
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,980
Let's hide it within the barriers.

1568
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,580
Can I just sell this at the store?

1569
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:07,280
Can I just go to the store and say...

1570
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,200
You wanna buy some of these?

1571
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,060
We'll sell the mushrooms too.

1572
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:22,210
They could call the cops on us.

1573
01:27:22,290 --> 01:27:24,270
We're hiding it amongst the berries.

1574
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:27,170
So don't worry so much if you're scared.

1575
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:29,990
Don't worry, we're hiding it.

1576
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:31,450
Don't worry.

1577
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:42,010
But it was mushrooms!

1578
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:47,730
In forests and mountain areas, add one gas thr- That's not me!

1579
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:48,850
What was I supposed to do?

1580
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:54,570
We are tired.

1581
01:27:58,410 --> 01:28:01,510
Let's sleep until morning.

1582
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:05,170
Next time, eat them, I guess.

1583
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:06,290
I guess so, right?

1584
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:06,350
Alright.

1585
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:12,950
Stay in a hostel three times.

1586
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:13,850
Comfortable.

1587
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:17,690
Yeah, let's check my skills real quick.

1588
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,740
This one, the social- Oh wait.

1589
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:32,060
Getting perfect with this gives you the social status.

1590
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:36,840
Cost is free!

1591
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,840
You become happy.

1592
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,380
Whenever you use a hitchhiker skill, this event restores one energy.

1593
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:45,240
Good to see ya.

1594
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,560
I never do this gain two armor.

1595
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,800
I should start using it.

1596
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:52,760
I should start using that.

1597
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:58,840
And then I guess we can...

1598
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:01,800
Wait, okay, let's see.

1599
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,060
Move right and left.

1600
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:06,020
Now you have access to the dog skills.

1601
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:08,460
Need an extra space in the car for the dog.

1602
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,680
Yeah, we have that one.

1603
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:12,460
I think.

1604
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,880
No longer have access to meat and dairy products from stores.

1605
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:18,400
What?!

1606
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,100
I don't have to follow your lifestyle, do I?

1607
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:23,900
The dog has very nice fur.

1608
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,460
And then our lady friend.

1609
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:30,720
I guess we're fine, maybe.

1610
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:30,780
Okay.

1611
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,440
Give the coke to the dog.

1612
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,640
What is wrong with you?!

1613
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,550
What is wrong with you?!

1614
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:53,250
My sister once had a friend.

1615
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:58,370
They gave an illegal drug to their dog.

1616
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:01,410
And I guess it worked differently.

1617
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:05,250
I was a child, so I couldn't do anything about this.

1618
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:08,250
But it like worked differently for...

1619
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:11,190
You know, their dog.

1620
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,330
And he just never came out of it.

1621
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:15,370
And so he would always just...

1622
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:17,370
He would always just stare in the corner.

1623
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:19,570
I remember that.

1624
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,420
Like he was just on like a permanent trip forever.

1625
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:33,220
I remember that.

1626
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,000
I didn't remember that until this moment.

1627
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,620
Where are we going?

1628
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:43,260
We're going to...

1629
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:44,620
Tascow.

1630
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,620
We're going to the big city, baby.

1631
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,180
I think this might be the furthest we've made.

1632
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:50,500
We've made it.

1633
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,520
Repressed memory, probably.

1634
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:56,620
Probably.

1635
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,280
I think we do need to buy a concert ticket somewhere, yeah.

1636
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,740
Or it was like you can also buy a tent.

1637
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,360
That's optional though.

1638
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,060
Hold on, it's in my... It's in our thing, no?

1639
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,540
Yeah, we gotta get a ticket.

1640
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,940
We go to Lompolis.

1641
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,100
Wait, is it?

1642
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,240
Yeah, we're on our way.

1643
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,780
We just gotta follow the highway.

1644
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:34,500
We're almost there.

1645
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,120
We got this.

1646
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,400
Someone might be getting kicked out.

1647
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:43,200
Help me out, brother.

1648
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:47,180
I've been running for 5 hours straight.

1649
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,700
My legs can't hold me up no more.

1650
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:50,740
I'm innocent.

1651
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:51,980
Oh, this is the guy.

1652
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,360
You gotta trust me.

1653
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,500
This is the convict.

1654
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,720
And he like steals your money.

1655
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,180
Oh, nevermind.

1656
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:00,540
Bye-bye.

1657
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,760
We're Thalia's.

1658
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,680
Thank you for 11 bucks.

1659
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:07,360
Thank you.

1660
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:10,280
Yeah, we got that guy on another one.

1661
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:11,360
Oh, fine.

1662
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:11,840
Whatever.

1663
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:12,880
What were you saying?

1664
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:14,660
Where did my happy go?

1665
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,620
What just happened?

1666
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,440
I looked away.

1667
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,520
I looked at chat for 2 seconds and suddenly she's not happy.

1668
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,800
ViviCore, thank you so much for the gift card!

1669
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:32,780
Look, it's great being on the road, but I really miss being alone in the morning, running hot water in my hands, just staring into the bathroom mirror.

1670
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:43,300
And you don't even know my name.

1671
01:32:56,380 --> 01:33:00,860
Our character is suddenly Venom.

1672
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:07,460
Getting up, making some tea and listening to music with the sun on my face.

1673
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:08,940
I like the tea.

1674
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,780
Oh, the girl asked if you have some weed.

1675
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:15,580
No way.

1676
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,820
No girl, didn't you see?

1677
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,540
We picked up the really strong stuff.

1678
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:23,280
When a minute feels like a second and a second feels like a minute.

1679
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,480
Wow, we're so happy.

1680
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,340
Nice Volvo 240.

1681
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,820
What are you, a car nerd?

1682
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,860
You know exactly what it is just by looking at it?

1683
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:48,660
Nerd.

1684
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:50,640
Hot wheels.

1685
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:51,580
Nerd.

1686
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,260
Add one durability threat.

1687
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,480
How much tape do we got?

1688
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,640
Oh, this is our last tape.

1689
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:06,920
Goodbye tape.

1690
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,920
We're gonna have to stock up on some more stuff soon.

1691
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,380
We'll get rid of this one.

1692
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,580
And then we can use this one.

1693
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:20,120
Takes one to know one.

1694
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:24,180
Maybe.

1695
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:34,350
What's a dog do?

1696
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:35,770
Bark.

1697
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,630
And then you're all that and you're all that.

1698
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:45,500
What's the dog doing?

1699
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:47,180
Oh, we're in the zone!

1700
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:49,340
The dog has reached level two!

1701
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:50,540
Oh my god, no way.

1702
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,280
The dog is leveling up.

1703
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:53,840
Wait, what does he do now?

1704
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:55,760
What's the dog doing?

1705
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,700
Traffic jam.

1706
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,400
Holy moly.

1707
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,850
Pet.

1708
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,100
He's so innocent.

1709
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:23,560
He's so cute.

1710
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:30,160
We don't have any negatives.

1711
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,360
But this one...

1712
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,300
Let's just do it.

1713
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,800
Dang it.

1714
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:37,900
So close.

1715
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:41,180
Hey dog.

1716
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,640
No, we got a random one.

1717
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:44,800
Hey dog.

1718
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:46,760
Take care of this one.

1719
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,220
Is it?

1720
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:50,780
Oh no, it's one out of two uses.

1721
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,160
Oh my gosh, it's not even unlimited?

1722
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:54,080
This is so messed up.

1723
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:55,120
Wait, hold on.

1724
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:57,940
I

1725
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:04,970
pet the dog.

1726
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:10,610
What is it?

1727
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:11,150
What the?

1728
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:12,250
Three more?

1729
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:12,610
Stop.

1730
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:14,010
Seriously?

1731
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:21,300
Pet.

1732
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:22,340
We're petting the dog.

1733
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:24,640
And we're gonna use him.

1734
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,420
There we go.

1735
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,020
Good enough.

1736
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,120
He's got two barks in him.

1737
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,380
He's such a good boy.

1738
01:36:33,460 --> 01:36:35,060
He's so obedient and quiet.

1739
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,040
Alright.

1740
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:41,820
Can we actually use the coke?

1741
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:42,740
That would be insane.

1742
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,440
I'm taking a sip of coke.

1743
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,140
You can use it.

1744
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:51,920
Wait, what does it do?

1745
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,160
Fully restores energy.

1746
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:58,220
Gain the speeded status.

1747
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:00,620
The money you guys.

1748
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:01,240
The money.

1749
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,700
The money.

1750
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,780
Look at the money.

1751
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,720
The goat in.

1752
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:12,520
Okay, here we go.

1753
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,220
Mushroom.

1754
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,160
Mushroom.

1755
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:20,900
Mushroom.

1756
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:22,140
Mushroom.

1757
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,440
Mushroom.

1758
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:30,500
So I guess it's $45 to buy, but you only get $22.50.

1759
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,060
If you sell it.

1760
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:46,570
I can't sell it!

1761
01:37:49,150 --> 01:37:49,790
Sorry.

1762
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:50,210
No.

1763
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:51,870
I don't have anything to...

1764
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:52,330
What?

1765
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:54,390
I don't have anything to sell.

1766
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:55,450
No.

1767
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:57,650
No.

1768
01:37:58,130 --> 01:37:59,070
I wasn't going to sell anything.

1769
01:37:59,150 --> 01:37:59,330
Sorry.

1770
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:05,610
When I said, hey, I have coke to sell, I meant Coca-Cola.

1771
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,620
I have...

1772
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:11,650
I thought... I didn't say coke.

1773
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:12,850
I said choke.

1774
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:16,830
Like, hey, you want to...

1775
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:18,990
You want to sell those hands?

1776
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:20,990
That's what I said.

1777
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:25,130
We're fine.

1778
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:36,630
I don't know.

1779
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:37,610
Are these...

1780
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:39,230
I was going to say, are those beans?

1781
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:40,610
But they're nuts.

1782
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:42,790
Ah, nuts.

1783
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,290
No, our pizza.

1784
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:44,910
Our pizza.

1785
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:45,730
How old...

1786
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:47,270
Do you think this is still any good?

1787
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:48,910
Our pizza.

1788
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:52,510
Oh, let's put the cigarettes back in the glove compartment.

1789
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:53,330
Those are important.

1790
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:58,130
And the coke in the glove compartment.

1791
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,540
Looking for... Oh, the black car.

1792
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:09,060
That's us.

1793
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:11,140
R60.

1794
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,340
Where is that?

1795
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,600
Where is R60?

1796
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:20,620
R60... Wait.

1797
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:22,320
No.

1798
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:23,800
No.

1799
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:25,680
No.

1800
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:28,620
62?

1801
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:30,260
7.

1802
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:31,860
Where is it?

1803
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:36,890
Everything is nonsense.

1804
01:39:37,010 --> 01:39:38,510
How are we supposed to...

1805
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:39,970
Bottom left?

1806
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:42,050
Oh, here.

1807
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:44,950
We would have to go back, huh?

1808
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:47,650
We're here.

1809
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:49,690
We would have to go back over here.

1810
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:54,270
What do you guys think?

1811
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:57,290
You think it's worth it?

1812
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:02,410
I actually have no much... I don't know at all what time it is.

1813
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:04,270
Too far?

1814
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:05,790
I think so too.

1815
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:07,150
For only 60 bucks.

1816
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:11,470
Let's see.

1817
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:12,150
What do we want to do?

1818
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:13,610
Forest watcher.

1819
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:14,890
Watch over the forest.

1820
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:16,550
Cabin cleaner.

1821
01:40:18,190 --> 01:40:19,110
That's it.

1822
01:40:23,110 --> 01:40:25,350
Of course we are going to go exploring.

1823
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,010
Scary.

1824
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:30,350
Scary.

1825
01:40:32,590 --> 01:40:35,210
You think we'll find any special magazines?

1826
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,240
Car.

1827
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:48,580
We could find more Coca-Cola.

1828
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:51,120
We might.

1829
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,220
I'm so lost.

1830
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,620
My energy is okay.

1831
01:40:56,900 --> 01:41:00,180
Where the hell are we?

1832
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,480
I'm really deep.

1833
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:05,420
I'm deep in it.

1834
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,540
I'm neck deep.

1835
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,080
I'm in the thick of it.

1836
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,800
Into the thick of it.

1837
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,540
Into the thick of it.

1838
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:19,360
I'm a little lost.

1839
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:24,390
I'm a little lost.

1840
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:30,650
I'm in the thick of it.

1841
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:34,070
We've been here before.

1842
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:35,950
If I go down here.

1843
01:41:36,530 --> 01:41:38,170
I go down here.

1844
01:41:38,490 --> 01:41:39,690
And I jump over here.

1845
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:40,570
Parkour.

1846
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:42,690
And I go over here.

1847
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:45,210
This is new territory.

1848
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:46,830
I think.

1849
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:48,070
And here.

1850
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:49,770
Another rock?

1851
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:00,150
Is that all that I can carry?

1852
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:02,110
Maybe one more thing if I find it.

1853
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:06,070
Also, I'm trying to find my way home.

1854
01:42:07,370 --> 01:42:09,170
I want to go home.

1855
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:13,770
I can hold 5 max.

1856
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:15,010
That's what it looks like.

1857
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,960
I made it!

1858
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:34,740
Make a random threat in the road events.

1859
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,320
Gain the note warning.

1860
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,280
We got scrap!

1861
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,500
We got lots of scrap.

1862
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,780
And more reading material.

1863
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,520
More cigarettes.

1864
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:00,310
Wait, what does it say?

1865
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:01,590
Restore 2 durability?

1866
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,530
We'll use that up.

1867
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:11,890
Reduce gas.

1868
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:14,330
Scrap?

1869
01:43:16,850 --> 01:43:19,850
I guess maybe this would be better to get than all the scrap.

1870
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:22,070
And Groovy Jesus.

1871
01:43:25,410 --> 01:43:30,150
I like that we can't switch.

1872
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:31,250
I know.

1873
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:32,770
Look, it's alternating.

1874
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:35,390
Ass, boobs, ass, boobs, ass.

1875
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:39,490
We have such a pretty array.

1876
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:39,730
Yay!

1877
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:45,030
Converter is only for country roads.

1878
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:48,210
Oh yeah, it does say country roads.

1879
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:48,590
You're right.

1880
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:57,950
What I'm trying to see is how I can sell it instead.

1881
01:43:58,090 --> 01:43:59,550
Maybe I just get rid of the scrap.

1882
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:02,330
Look, we get 350 for it.

1883
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:07,070
And we have 1, 2, 3, 4.

1884
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:08,430
Calculator.

1885
01:44:09,710 --> 01:44:10,750
350.

1886
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:12,590
We're really mathematizing now.

1887
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:13,810
Times 4.

1888
01:44:16,230 --> 01:44:17,130
Oh, I'm sorry.

1889
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,450
5 plus 350.

1890
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:22,610
Is 1750.

1891
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:27,210
And then this.

1892
01:44:27,730 --> 01:44:29,630
28 divided by 2.

1893
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:31,490
Is 14.

1894
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:35,290
Or 10.

1895
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:36,170
Oh.

1896
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:39,030
24 for the both of them.

1897
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:46,990
So we could do 1750 or 24.

1898
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:50,470
Yeah.

1899
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:53,430
Let's eat some chips.

1900
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:00,370
Goodbye scrap.

1901
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:06,330
Let's see if I can make enough space to save some scrap.

1902
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:08,230
Rotate.

1903
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:10,290
Nope.

1904
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:12,870
Discard.

1905
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:13,370
Yup.

1906
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:14,550
Discard.

1907
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:14,910
Yup.

1908
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,470
And we'll just sell those.

1909
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:19,550
And what about Groovy Jesus?

1910
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:21,870
It's the same amount.

1911
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:23,750
Wait.

1912
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:24,670
Discard.

1913
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:25,570
Not that scrap.

1914
01:45:25,710 --> 01:45:25,850
Oh.

1915
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:27,770
I'm an idiot.

1916
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:28,530
Wait.

1917
01:45:28,950 --> 01:45:29,150
Oh.

1918
01:45:30,130 --> 01:45:31,070
Oh no.

1919
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:34,450
Wait.

1920
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:42,340
Let's do the chocolate.

1921
01:45:50,530 --> 01:45:53,810
What if I use the...

1922
01:45:58,610 --> 01:46:00,850
We are not stinky so...

1923
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:03,850
I guess I could use the...

1924
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,370
We're good.

1925
01:46:09,470 --> 01:46:10,370
There was one banana.

1926
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:11,110
Alright.

1927
01:46:11,530 --> 01:46:12,250
Let's go sell it.

1928
01:46:13,050 --> 01:46:13,970
Some place.

1929
01:46:14,890 --> 01:46:15,650
Here.

1930
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:17,570
Hello.

1931
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:19,430
Take my Groovy Jesus.

1932
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:22,850
Take my converter.

1933
01:46:24,070 --> 01:46:25,450
Take my scrap.

1934
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:27,650
Take my...

1935
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:29,670
Well actually...

1936
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:30,950
Headlights.

1937
01:46:34,270 --> 01:46:37,650
I wonder if we could...

1938
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:39,610
use it.

1939
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:41,050
I don't know.

1940
01:46:41,050 --> 01:46:41,170
I don't know.

1941
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:44,970
6.3 channel.

1942
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:46,110
Thank you.

1943
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:48,290
Welcome to membership.

1944
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:51,210
Welcome to membership.

1945
01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:54,110
Thank you.

1946
01:46:55,630 --> 01:46:57,630
Headlights look worth installing.

1947
01:46:58,030 --> 01:47:00,870
Depends on what other thing I have to replace it with.

1948
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:04,030
Upgrade.

1949
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:05,050
It would be...

1950
01:47:05,630 --> 01:47:06,570
Is it this one?

1951
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:07,610
I hope it's this.

1952
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:07,950
Right?

1953
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:08,610
No.

1954
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:09,210
It's engine.

1955
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:14,290
It would probably be this, but the durability is too good, no?

1956
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:17,410
Thank you!

1957
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:21,110
Thank you for the 10 gifts.

1958
01:47:24,910 --> 01:47:27,690
I like my woman like how I like my cars.

1959
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:28,870
Full of cars.

1960
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:41,440
Let's buy...

1961
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,820
this and drink it.

1962
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:44,140
Nice.

1963
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:51,340
I'm also gonna do some work.

1964
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:54,280
Let's see.

1965
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,260
8 hours...

1966
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:57,760
24 hours and you only get paid 40?

1967
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,320
But it's only 3 energy.

1968
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:02,580
Okay, we'll do this and then we'll sleep.

1969
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:09,540
Night falls.

1970
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,040
We're dirty.

1971
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:15,340
Now I'm dirty.

1972
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:16,180
Now I'm stinky.

1973
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:17,760
Now I'm disgusting and gross.

1974
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,360
I'll use my toilet paper.

1975
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:23,640
And now we sleep.

1976
01:48:30,050 --> 01:48:31,430
We're a little cold.

1977
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:33,710
Oh wait, did I drink both the... Oops, sorry.

1978
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,310
Did I drink both the coffees?

1979
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:39,390
Oh, wrong place.

1980
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:44,890
I did not use...

1981
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:46,210
Okay, now we're just hungry.

1982
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:48,790
Perfect.

1983
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:52,470
Alright, let's get some more gas.

1984
01:48:56,410 --> 01:48:57,450
Good enough.

1985
01:48:59,810 --> 01:49:00,530
Nice.

1986
01:49:01,670 --> 01:49:02,890
On the road again.

1987
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:06,670
I can't wait to get on the road again.

1988
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:08,490
Let's go to fairies.

1989
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:09,910
Fairies.

1990
01:49:10,730 --> 01:49:11,710
Very good fairies.

1991
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:13,450
Wait, what's in Winga?

1992
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:15,470
Winga.

1993
01:49:16,110 --> 01:49:17,030
What's there?

1994
01:49:18,130 --> 01:49:19,150
Money ying yang.

1995
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:20,110
Thank you for the super chat.

1996
01:49:22,730 --> 01:49:23,690
Where is there?

1997
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:25,690
What's here?

1998
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:26,410
It's a mystery.

1999
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:29,430
We can have a little detour, no?

2000
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:32,590
Let's go.

2001
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:40,440
Do you want an egg?

2002
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:41,420
Sure.

2003
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:47,420
Oh my gosh, did you guys see the...

2004
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:48,460
The...

2005
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:51,720
Popcorn bucket for...

2006
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:53,300
For the Minecraft movie?

2007
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:55,400
Oh sorry, it's not THE Minecraft movie.

2008
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:57,780
It's A Minecraft movie.

2009
01:49:58,820 --> 01:50:01,560
And how it's like a TNT block, it's actually so cute.

2010
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:05,000
Sunrisers.

2011
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,200
Yeah, the TNT box.

2012
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,240
I don't understand why they're so obsessed with the chicken jockey though.

2013
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:14,420
There are billions of different faces.

2014
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:17,500
And I feel like I've seen most of them before.

2015
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:18,580
That's kind of weird.

2016
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,600
It's like the simulation's random generator is busted.

2017
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,460
There are so many weird faces, yet they are...

2018
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:29,060
Always some version of a face I've seen before.

2019
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:32,200
Sometimes I wonder if there are only so many types...

2020
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:34,480
That just get slightly morphed.

2021
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:40,020
Huh?

2022
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:45,460
I think we took the...

2023
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:47,360
The crack cocaine in our...

2024
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:48,720
In our glove box.

2025
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:50,820
The simulation's busted.

2026
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:53,660
Or just lazily made.

2027
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,780
No, we're stressed!

2028
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:10,560
Oh man, I can't believe I thought about the Matrix.

2029
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:12,520
I'm getting freaked out.

2030
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:16,740
That's craziness.

2031
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,240
I guess I really don't need this.

2032
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,960
I'm gonna waste up the multi-spray.

2033
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:29,260
Because with this we have unlimited things.

2034
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,240
So I'm just gonna use this.

2035
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:33,260
To get rid of stuff.

2036
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:39,620
Do we have a single... Yes!

2037
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:40,980
Single dog.

2038
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:42,560
Uh-oh, wait.

2039
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:48,800
We lost some gas.

2040
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:49,240
Oh no.

2041
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:51,520
We lost some gas.

2042
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,120
Oh no.

2043
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:54,180
Oh, we can use that one.

2044
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:54,580
There we go.

2045
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:57,420
Threat averted.

2046
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,680
We lost so much gas actually.

2047
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:05,040
Adapt changes though depending on the road.

2048
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,600
Oh, does it?

2049
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:06,420
I haven't noticed.

2050
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:12,240
Oh, our music.

2051
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:16,320
Sorry, I just keep playing the same thing.

2052
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:27,170
Forest shadows?

2053
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:30,250
Slenderman?

2054
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:33,770
What does this mean?

2055
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:38,370
What are... What is the threat?

2056
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:48,180
The girl has reached level 2.

2057
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:51,360
I can't believe the dog reached level 2 before the girl.

2058
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:52,460
What just happened?

2059
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:59,740
Spooky forest?

2060
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,660
Thunderstorm?

2061
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,900
Oh no, that one's scary.

2062
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:04,080
Your shades came in clutch.

2063
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:06,940
Fun!

2064
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:21,560
Come on, dog.

2065
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:24,040
Bark at it.

2066
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:25,280
Bark!

2067
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:27,300
Oh no.

2068
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:29,180
Add one durability threat.

2069
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,420
Bow-bow!

2070
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,500
Bow-bow at it.

2071
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,360
Let's do...

2072
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,640
Okay, this might be a little overkill, but...

2073
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:46,720
Three random threats.

2074
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:48,140
There we go.

2075
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,580
Oh my gas!

2076
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,620
You are feeling tired.

2077
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:57,580
Very tired.

2078
01:53:58,300 --> 01:53:59,840
Fix it on keeping your eyes open.

2079
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:00,980
Slap yourself in the face.

2080
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:02,800
Ouch!

2081
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:03,540
You're awake.

2082
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:05,180
We're awake now.

2083
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:06,720
Oh, nevermind.

2084
01:54:06,820 --> 01:54:07,320
Plus tired.

2085
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,520
Plus tired.

2086
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:15,640
We're here!

2087
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,020
We made it.

2088
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,060
To fairies.

2089
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,920
When is it going to stop raining?

2090
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:27,160
Winter tires.

2091
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:28,360
Basic wheels.

2092
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,380
Sport tires.

2093
01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:32,080
Remove one gas threat.

2094
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,200
I want to kind of have one of those, but...

2095
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:36,120
I guess it's fine.

2096
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:42,280
Okay.

2097
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:45,600
Time for the drugs.

2098
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:47,140
Oh yes, this, this, this.

2099
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,500
Oh yeah, see?

2100
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,260
I knew I was going to do this down here.

2101
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:53,540
I think this one is still better than the headlight.

2102
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:56,300
At night, make a random threat on a row of events, gaining the note...

2103
01:54:56,300 --> 01:54:57,540
What is the note warning?

2104
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:58,680
We don't even know what that is.

2105
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:00,920
We don't even know!

2106
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:02,800
Oh yeah, maybe he'll buy it.

2107
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:04,080
Take it.

2108
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,480
Hey buddy, I got the good stuff.

2109
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:08,180
I'm not a cop.

2110
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,100
I'm not planting this on you.

2111
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:13,820
I won't arrest you immediately afterwards, because I found it on you.

2112
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:16,740
I'm a good guy.

2113
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:19,760
Welcome back.

2114
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:20,560
Thanks Carl!

2115
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:25,640
The musical one that removes adjacent threats.

2116
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:28,080
Oh, but it's only at night.

2117
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:28,160
Night.

2118
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:32,580
That's fine.

2119
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:40,200
Oh, black car.

2120
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:42,440
R61.

2121
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,140
That's not the same one as before.

2122
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:49,470
Oh!

2123
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:49,930
R61!

2124
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:51,890
We're literally on the way to there.

2125
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:53,910
We can make it, we can make it.

2126
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:56,110
Let's get paid.

2127
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:57,990
Make money, make money!

2128
01:56:03,070 --> 01:56:03,590
Freerun.

2129
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:07,230
We're short on staff and need to deliver some pizzas to Freerun.

2130
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:09,410
Elves get hungry.

2131
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:13,090
Freerun is...

2132
01:56:13,730 --> 01:56:14,250
Freerun.

2133
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:19,410
Wait, so if we go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2134
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:20,410
We could make both.

2135
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:23,250
We could make both, I think.

2136
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:25,730
Both jobs.

2137
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:26,730
But what's the last job?

2138
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:29,650
Freerun.

2139
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:30,110
Lompolis.

2140
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:32,970
I need beer for a party!

2141
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:34,850
It's in 4 days!

2142
01:56:38,770 --> 01:56:41,510
Oh, we're also going there.

2143
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:43,490
We could do all three.

2144
01:56:43,810 --> 01:56:45,270
Let's do it, let's do it.

2145
01:57:01,970 --> 01:57:03,690
Ok, this is not our pizza.

2146
01:57:04,570 --> 01:57:06,230
Wait, for the beer run too maybe?

2147
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:07,410
Do I have to include the beer?

2148
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:08,650
Beer is huge!

2149
01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:14,470
I have too many sexy magazines to include the beer.

2150
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:16,130
I think.

2151
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:19,750
Well, I didn't accept the beer one.

2152
01:57:21,190 --> 01:57:21,810
Right?

2153
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:24,630
Forget the beer.

2154
01:57:25,110 --> 01:57:26,390
It's 60 bucks though.

2155
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:29,290
Maybe I should have done...

2156
01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:34,650
How much money am I getting from the pizza delivery?

2157
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:35,410
I don't remember.

2158
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:37,870
Ah, man.

2159
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:43,350
We're gonna explore and then we'll see.

2160
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:51,260
I like exploring.

2161
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,500
I like this part a lot.

2162
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:54,560
It's pretty fun.

2163
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:57,420
Mushroom, mushroom.

2164
01:57:58,580 --> 01:57:59,860
Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom.

2165
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:02,920
I wonder how you get through the vines.

2166
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:05,420
Maybe you need a cutter or something.

2167
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:07,360
Thank god.

2168
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:10,420
How do you say?

2169
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:15,980
Something.

2170
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:19,900
A knife.

2171
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:21,080
Yeah, like a machete.

2172
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:26,200
Am I back at the beginning?

2173
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:28,720
I'm kinda lost.

2174
01:58:31,630 --> 01:58:33,910
This will lead to a rock.

2175
01:58:35,790 --> 01:58:36,430
I'm lost.

2176
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:38,150
More mushroom.

2177
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:42,290
I don't think you can eat the mushroom, can you?

2178
01:58:42,290 --> 01:58:45,490
Do you think you'll get a tummy ache if you eat too many?

2179
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:52,230
Berries.

2180
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:55,110
Berries go blue.

2181
01:58:57,970 --> 01:58:59,230
Where am I?

2182
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:02,730
We made it!

2183
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:06,050
We got a fender.

2184
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:08,430
And some scrap.

2185
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:10,130
And some more scrap.

2186
01:59:11,490 --> 01:59:13,570
And lots and lots of berries.

2187
01:59:14,370 --> 01:59:15,430
We got more food.

2188
01:59:15,530 --> 01:59:17,030
In fact, I'm just gonna eat that right now.

2189
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:20,830
And we can sell these mushrooms and the scrap.

2190
01:59:22,510 --> 01:59:23,310
For the camera.

2191
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:25,570
Can I just get rid of it?

2192
01:59:25,590 --> 01:59:26,570
Because it says...

2193
01:59:27,570 --> 01:59:30,590
Grants you access to change camera filters in the options menu.

2194
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:32,890
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

2195
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:35,150
No, no, no, no, no.

2196
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:35,850
Okay, hold on.

2197
01:59:38,350 --> 01:59:39,710
I keep hoarding food.

2198
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:40,930
I need to stop doing that.

2199
01:59:45,990 --> 01:59:47,530
It isn't useful in gameplay.

2200
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:49,890
Yeah, I'm just kinda curious about it.

2201
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:50,850
Wait, use.

2202
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:53,310
Use?

2203
01:59:54,390 --> 01:59:54,870
Use.

2204
01:59:55,570 --> 01:59:56,370
Wait, what just happened to me?

2205
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:57,290
Sad!

2206
01:59:58,750 --> 01:59:59,710
Double damage!

2207
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:00,230
Uh-oh.

2208
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:02,450
Guys, I don't think I should have eaten so many.

2209
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:04,510
I ate too many.

2210
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:06,290
I ate too many mushrooms.

2211
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:08,530
I'm getting sadder.

2212
02:00:09,990 --> 02:00:11,190
Okay, don't eat the mushrooms.

2213
02:00:11,190 --> 02:00:14,110
I had a poisonous mushroom, I think.

2214
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:16,270
I'm gonna need this toilet paper bad.

2215
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:20,650
I'm gonna need it bad.

2216
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:23,110
This one, though, restores energy.

2217
02:00:23,970 --> 02:00:25,970
So we'll eat the yellow ones.

2218
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:26,670
Those ones are good.

2219
02:00:27,050 --> 02:00:27,830
Wait, what did I just do?

2220
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:28,450
No, eat it.

2221
02:00:30,910 --> 02:00:34,650
Actually, let's eat and scrap.

2222
02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:37,930
And, wait, how much does this sell for?

2223
02:00:38,050 --> 02:00:38,370
10?

2224
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:42,310
4?

2225
02:00:44,310 --> 02:00:45,510
4 and...

2226
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:46,110
450.

2227
02:00:48,270 --> 02:00:48,870
850.

2228
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:04,380
Oh wait, how do I fed it?

2229
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:04,980
Oh, here we go.

2230
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:07,040
Just like that.

2231
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:08,860
And then we can tell it right now.

2232
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:12,880
Sell.

2233
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:14,140
Nice.

2234
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:16,280
Jar of eggs!

2235
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:16,840
Whoa!

2236
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:21,540
Danish.

2237
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:23,240
Tea.

2238
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:26,640
Let's sleep.

2239
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,220
Can we go to McDonald's, Minto?

2240
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:33,640
No.

2241
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:36,220
I have a headache.

2242
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:37,780
Wait, aspirin!

2243
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:42,520
Goodbye, headache.

2244
02:01:42,660 --> 02:01:43,340
And we're dirty.

2245
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:46,420
And we're hungry.

2246
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:46,460
Hungry?

2247
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:48,260
No longer.

2248
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:50,180
We are in TimTop shape.

2249
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:52,420
I need to go to sleep tomorrow.

2250
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,300
I gotta work early.

2251
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:55,000
Goodnight, enjoy ghosts!

2252
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:56,340
I'll watch the VOD later.

2253
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:57,680
Aw, thank you.

2254
02:01:58,420 --> 02:01:59,240
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2255
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:09,040
Alright, I think we're good to continue onwards.

2256
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:12,280
And we are headed to...

2257
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:13,900
TimTown!

2258
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:14,840
Oh no!

2259
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:16,800
Sorry, we're going to Vinga, baby.

2260
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,580
We're going to Mystery City.

2261
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:20,460
Oh wait.

2262
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:25,800
Some of those events were timed.

2263
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,240
Majestic Falcon.

2264
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:44,620
We're probably okay.

2265
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:49,080
Your first play of this got me to buy a Game O and thank you Minto.

2266
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:49,500
Yeah!

2267
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:51,100
I'm glad you liked it.

2268
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:53,740
Glad you liked it, yeah.

2269
02:02:53,880 --> 02:02:54,420
So awesome.

2270
02:02:56,760 --> 02:02:58,560
Oh, I guess...

2271
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,360
That's kind of lame.

2272
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:04,420
That was kind of lame because I...

2273
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:10,600
I don't...

2274
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:11,840
Oh, you don't have a thing yet.

2275
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:15,200
Remove all status effects.

2276
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:16,780
Become inspired and tired.

2277
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:18,260
What does inspired do?

2278
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:31,620
How did we get a headache and cold and everything?

2279
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:33,800
What happened to us?

2280
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:37,040
What happened to us?

2281
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:40,560
How did we become... How did we get another headache?

2282
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:42,360
No!

2283
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:44,620
I was in the middle of doing that!

2284
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:44,940
No!

2285
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:47,660
Oh my god.

2286
02:03:53,580 --> 02:03:54,100
Okay...

2287
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:56,340
The girl gives you a debuff for every buff?

2288
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,060
I knew she was... I knew she was the worst.

2289
02:04:04,590 --> 02:04:06,810
She's also such a particular...

2290
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:08,690
She gives me a back rub.

2291
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:11,690
That's so messed up.

2292
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:14,390
There we go.

2293
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:16,590
We'll just get rid of all of it.

2294
02:04:17,570 --> 02:04:18,450
I don't care anymore.

2295
02:04:23,980 --> 02:04:29,440
My gas... Guys, warn me about my gas in case I...

2296
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:30,400
I'm stressed.

2297
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:31,420
I'm inspired.

2298
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:33,800
Why am I inspired?

2299
02:04:34,140 --> 02:04:35,300
What am I stressed?

2300
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:36,940
What's going on?

2301
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:46,840
I'm gonna pet the dog.

2302
02:04:50,110 --> 02:04:52,670
I actually have no idea what inspired does.

2303
02:04:58,530 --> 02:05:00,830
Take powder to remove the stress.

2304
02:05:00,990 --> 02:05:01,230
No!

2305
02:05:01,770 --> 02:05:03,810
That'll make me more stressed.

2306
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:08,090
It'll make me even more stressed.

2307
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:10,310
Peer pressure.

2308
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:11,650
Peer pressure.

2309
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:18,990
More attacks this turn.

2310
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:29,250
Let's just do this one.

2311
02:05:29,410 --> 02:05:30,090
Let's get rid of it.

2312
02:05:35,770 --> 02:05:37,830
Dog is almost leveled up.

2313
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:44,900
Distracted.

2314
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:48,900
Just... Stop?

2315
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:50,680
You control this.

2316
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:53,000
You don't have to be distracted.

2317
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:53,820
What is saver?

2318
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:56,220
What does that mean?

2319
02:05:56,780 --> 02:05:57,660
What does that mean?

2320
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:02,860
Nazo no status.

2321
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,500
What does that even mean?

2322
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:09,880
I'm distracted.

2323
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:11,920
Bark!

2324
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:13,700
I'm not distracted anymore.

2325
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:14,600
I got barked at.

2326
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:26,070
There we go.

2327
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:29,430
You can check it by hovering in the mirror?

2328
02:06:30,210 --> 02:06:31,410
How in the mirror?

2329
02:06:44,770 --> 02:06:47,370
The girl is giving us negative statuses now.

2330
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:50,610
She's not a girl's girl at all.

2331
02:06:50,730 --> 02:06:51,970
Why are you such a hater?

2332
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:53,690
I'm just gonna use this one.

2333
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:56,290
I feel like we should get this one out of the way.

2334
02:06:56,450 --> 02:06:58,910
It's kind of very situational.

2335
02:06:59,070 --> 02:06:59,650
You know what I mean?

2336
02:07:03,190 --> 02:07:04,130
Dog leveled up.

2337
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:09,840
Okay.

2338
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,040
The ocean.

2339
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:20,780
Both calm and violent.

2340
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:24,140
I wonder how long this lighthouse has been standing here.

2341
02:07:25,420 --> 02:07:27,760
One day I would like to set out to the sea.

2342
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:30,160
Imagine being a lighthouse keeper.

2343
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:36,280
I would like to set out to the sea.

2344
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,700
Yo-ho!

2345
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:38,680
Yo-ho!

2346
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:40,800
A pirate's life for me.

2347
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:44,280
Guys, if I wasn't a ghost maid...

2348
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:48,480
Lose one energy after buying an item.

2349
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:49,000
What?

2350
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:51,720
This sucks!

2351
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:53,500
We came here for nothing!

2352
02:07:55,740 --> 02:08:00,900
I once said though, if I wasn't a ghost maid, I would have wanted to be a pirate.

2353
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:01,220
Pirate.

2354
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:06,100
I like pirates.

2355
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:08,920
Oh, I forgot that we can use the gas pedal too.

2356
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:10,860
I'll have to remember that.

2357
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:12,500
Alright, we're leaving.

2358
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:15,980
We're heading back.

2359
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:19,120
Oh wait, I forgot to sleep.

2360
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:20,820
Maybe we'll be okay.

2361
02:08:22,020 --> 02:08:22,980
A ghost pirate?

2362
02:08:29,090 --> 02:08:29,630
Maybe.

2363
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:38,910
I could be like the skellies on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.

2364
02:08:44,210 --> 02:08:44,710
Sorry.

2365
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:48,990
I'm so sick of these dang effects.

2366
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:51,750
I should have slept or something.

2367
02:08:52,030 --> 02:08:52,950
No, it's probably fine.

2368
02:08:54,070 --> 02:08:54,430
Come on.

2369
02:08:54,810 --> 02:08:55,190
Come on.

2370
02:08:55,850 --> 02:08:56,330
Come on.

2371
02:08:56,410 --> 02:08:56,790
There we go.

2372
02:09:04,530 --> 02:09:06,190
Goodbye, Inspired.

2373
02:09:06,270 --> 02:09:07,510
I don't know why it disappeared.

2374
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:11,610
I'm stressed.

2375
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:13,850
That's the real truth.

2376
02:09:17,090 --> 02:09:18,470
Okay, perfect.

2377
02:09:24,130 --> 02:09:25,770
Oh my gosh.

2378
02:09:26,930 --> 02:09:27,930
We're sad.

2379
02:09:28,570 --> 02:09:29,510
Why are we sad?

2380
02:09:30,090 --> 02:09:32,190
The girl is too much of a pain after level 3.

2381
02:09:32,350 --> 02:09:33,890
I think I'm gonna get rid of her for real.

2382
02:09:34,990 --> 02:09:37,150
Can't take any extra turns during road events.

2383
02:09:37,210 --> 02:09:37,950
This sucks.

2384
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:39,770
Oh my gosh, a tractor.

2385
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:43,990
Look, we have so many negative effects.

2386
02:09:45,130 --> 02:09:45,870
Gas low.

2387
02:09:46,510 --> 02:09:47,290
Gas low.

2388
02:09:48,090 --> 02:09:48,930
Gas low.

2389
02:09:51,490 --> 02:09:52,350
Gas is low.

2390
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:55,210
We're gonna speedrun this a little bit.

2391
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:09,920
Do you die if you fail?

2392
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:10,840
Actually, I don't.

2393
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:12,940
I'm not quite sure.

2394
02:10:18,590 --> 02:10:19,110
Perfect.

2395
02:10:20,210 --> 02:10:20,730
Nice.

2396
02:10:20,890 --> 02:10:21,150
Nice.

2397
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:21,450
Nice.

2398
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:21,770
Nice.

2399
02:10:25,110 --> 02:10:26,670
Gas light not on yet.

2400
02:10:26,730 --> 02:10:30,010
I think the blinking is it technically being on.

2401
02:10:30,670 --> 02:10:32,230
Why do we all have shades on?

2402
02:10:32,350 --> 02:10:32,530
Wait.

2403
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:35,750
Why does the dog have shades?

2404
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:37,370
I just noticed it.

2405
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:38,050
It's so cute.

2406
02:10:40,350 --> 02:10:40,870
Hi.

2407
02:10:56,290 --> 02:10:57,690
Everybody is eepy but me.

2408
02:10:58,110 --> 02:10:59,590
Oh, they don't have the shades on anymore.

2409
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:01,570
What was that?

2410
02:11:03,630 --> 02:11:05,010
What was that?

2411
02:11:06,450 --> 02:11:08,910
Oh gosh, this is tricky.

2412
02:11:10,710 --> 02:11:11,930
This is kind of tricky.

2413
02:11:13,190 --> 02:11:13,950
Let's just do this.

2414
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:14,830
Get rid of it.

2415
02:11:16,470 --> 02:11:17,730
Get me to town.

2416
02:11:17,730 --> 02:11:20,710
Allow me to sleep, please.

2417
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:21,190
Oh my gosh.

2418
02:11:21,290 --> 02:11:21,430
Please.

2419
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:21,670
Please.

2420
02:11:21,890 --> 02:11:21,890
Please.

2421
02:11:22,070 --> 02:11:22,130
Please.

2422
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:25,050
Use.

2423
02:11:28,150 --> 02:11:32,030
I think we would... I think we really would have run out.

2424
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:33,290
Actually, I'm just gonna use it.

2425
02:11:33,770 --> 02:11:35,070
We can sell it afterwards.

2426
02:11:36,770 --> 02:11:37,170
What?

2427
02:11:37,530 --> 02:11:39,110
That was not half way.

2428
02:11:40,530 --> 02:11:41,270
Messed up.

2429
02:11:42,710 --> 02:11:44,190
How do we stop being sad?

2430
02:11:46,270 --> 02:11:49,190
How do we stop being sad?

2431
02:11:51,490 --> 02:11:53,430
No, you can't refill the jerry can.

2432
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:55,130
Which is like really strange, no?

2433
02:11:57,310 --> 02:11:58,510
You think chocolate helps?

2434
02:11:59,790 --> 02:12:01,070
Vague lanes.

2435
02:12:04,530 --> 02:12:05,710
Kick the girl.

2436
02:12:05,910 --> 02:12:06,390
I will.

2437
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:08,110
Great question.

2438
02:12:09,410 --> 02:12:11,010
Isn't that what we are all after?

2439
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:14,330
Just wanting to stop being sad.

2440
02:12:15,010 --> 02:12:17,270
Oh my gosh, this is so frustrating.

2441
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:18,530
This one is so annoying.

2442
02:12:19,110 --> 02:12:20,390
Am I gonna be able to get out of this?

2443
02:12:20,490 --> 02:12:21,150
Hold on, let's see.

2444
02:12:21,970 --> 02:12:23,610
And then I can use this one on this.

2445
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:28,430
We would accept you just the same.

2446
02:12:28,570 --> 02:12:30,670
Pirate maid, you are still my oshi until you...

2447
02:12:30,670 --> 02:12:32,030
Until you get cancelled.

2448
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:37,410
Oh no, that took a hit.

2449
02:12:41,210 --> 02:12:42,270
I'm getting cancelled.

2450
02:12:45,560 --> 02:12:47,340
I only have one left of these.

2451
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:49,440
This is so bad.

2452
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:52,660
Everybody is asleep.

2453
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:54,280
Can you guys please wake up?

2454
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:59,120
I'm in pretty dire straits, I'm not gonna lie.

2455
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:04,680
I'm gonna do this and then I'm gonna use that one.

2456
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:08,380
I'm in pretty dire straits, I'm not gonna lie.

2457
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:13,300
Oh my gosh, no!

2458
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:15,760
Why did it add an extra one?

2459
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:19,700
Wants to be a pirate and she is wearing a straw hat.

2460
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:23,460
I'm king of the pirates baby.

2461
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:27,300
What do I do?

2462
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:30,420
Guys, what do I do?

2463
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:30,480
What do I do?

2464
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:41,420
I can't use the dog.

2465
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:48,660
Hold the gas.

2466
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:49,420
You are so right.

2467
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:52,640
Which one is gas?

2468
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:55,180
This one?

2469
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:01,360
We made it!

2470
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:10,940
Break.

2471
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:14,320
Press to close any open menu.

2472
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:15,400
It buys the game.

2473
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:17,880
It would've just buys the game.

2474
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:18,940
Oh it's closed.

2475
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:20,820
It would've been fine.

2476
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:24,460
We are tired.

2477
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:25,980
Don't worry, we are gonna explore.

2478
02:14:29,380 --> 02:14:32,280
We are gonna have a great journey and then we will sleep.

2479
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:36,300
We will sleep all through it baby.

2480
02:14:46,350 --> 02:14:47,030
Berries.

2481
02:14:55,870 --> 02:14:57,910
Such a lust for revenge.

2482
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:03,210
I like the little hop, it's so cute.

2483
02:15:06,290 --> 02:15:06,970
Mushroom.

2484
02:15:09,190 --> 02:15:10,350
Actual stuff.

2485
02:15:14,130 --> 02:15:14,430
War.

2486
02:15:16,150 --> 02:15:18,690
They say a ghost haunts these wars.

2487
02:15:19,510 --> 02:15:23,530
I'm celebrating my birthday with Mindo and all of you guys!

2488
02:15:24,070 --> 02:15:25,750
Oh my gosh, Sami!

2489
02:15:27,350 --> 02:15:28,550
Happy birthday!

2490
02:15:29,450 --> 02:15:29,950
Hold on.

2491
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:31,050
Let me make sure.

2492
02:15:31,590 --> 02:15:34,110
Let me just make sure I've cleared everything in here.

2493
02:15:36,690 --> 02:15:37,970
I'm watching my energy.

2494
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:41,990
Yeah.

2495
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:46,650
Back to this front.

2496
02:15:47,950 --> 02:15:48,830
Wait, I'm lost.

2497
02:15:50,090 --> 02:15:51,370
Guys, I'm really lost.

2498
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:54,830
Happy birthday to you!

2499
02:15:55,530 --> 02:15:57,970
Happy birthday to you!

2500
02:15:58,430 --> 02:16:01,070
Happy birthday dear Samira!

2501
02:16:02,170 --> 02:16:06,510
Happy birthday to you!

2502
02:16:07,790 --> 02:16:08,790
Happy birthday!

2503
02:16:10,150 --> 02:16:10,830
It's okay.

2504
02:16:11,770 --> 02:16:12,710
We can still eat.

2505
02:16:13,130 --> 02:16:14,490
Or take in energy.

2506
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:20,500
I'll just use that much.

2507
02:16:24,290 --> 02:16:24,990
I'm lost.

2508
02:16:27,230 --> 02:16:30,710
It was like in a strange little corner, no?

2509
02:16:31,250 --> 02:16:33,350
Oh gosh you guys, I'm really lost actually.

2510
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:52,610
Did I come from this way?

2511
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:00,780
I found it!

2512
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:01,880
Oh my goodness.

2513
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:02,760
We made it.

2514
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:03,240
Let's go.

2515
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:06,600
A new magazine!

2516
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:15,440
More booty.

2517
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,200
Literally.

2518
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:17,340
Literally.

2519
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:23,440
My toilet paper is looking mighty sad right now.

2520
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:27,020
I won't take any of the berries.

2521
02:17:28,380 --> 02:17:29,780
But I will take our new finds.

2522
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:35,520
This is the optimal way to play this game everybody, okay?

2523
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:41,180
Please understand that what I'm doing is recommended.

2524
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:47,280
It's 100% the strat.

2525
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:51,860
We have a lot of red berries so we'll get some blue berries.

2526
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:54,120
I'm gonna make more money soon.

2527
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:57,920
Thanks for always being here for us.

2528
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:00,120
You get a new job Wally!

2529
02:18:01,060 --> 02:18:02,420
Wally for golly.

2530
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:05,200
Congratulations!

2531
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:05,520
Congratulations!

2532
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:17,360
She looks... Do you think she's cursing me because I have so much porn in my backseat?

2533
02:18:18,200 --> 02:18:20,420
She's really upset about it.

2534
02:18:21,380 --> 02:18:23,220
She's just like...

2535
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:26,700
Yes!

2536
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,420
Toss the jerry can.

2537
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:31,800
Oh true, true true.

2538
02:18:37,150 --> 02:18:40,370
We can... The flashlight will sell first.

2539
02:18:40,510 --> 02:18:43,010
We already have one so we can just sell the other one.

2540
02:18:44,630 --> 02:18:45,130
Okay.

2541
02:18:46,970 --> 02:18:48,550
Throw it away, throw it away.

2542
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:53,920
Sell.

2543
02:18:56,520 --> 02:18:58,480
And... I'm gonna sell the mushroom too.

2544
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:02,320
And...

2545
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:03,560
That should be good.

2546
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:04,600
Let's go to sleep.

2547
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:12,030
You're just a cultured, principled player.

2548
02:19:15,430 --> 02:19:17,670
When is it gonna stop raining?

2549
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:20,250
This is the worst.

2550
02:19:21,090 --> 02:19:23,150
Alright, we're not dirty anymore at least.

2551
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:31,980
Oh that's right.

2552
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:34,200
I wanted to try... Okay, options, right?

2553
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:36,120
Here?

2554
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:36,800
Is this options?

2555
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:45,260
K-chrome, J-one, Polaroid, Fuji... Wow, these are like actual cameras.

2556
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:47,560
I'm selling the camera.

2557
02:19:49,300 --> 02:19:50,180
Thank you.

2558
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:50,780
Give me money.

2559
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:51,120
Okay.

2560
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:53,240
Alright, let's go onwards.

2561
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:58,120
We're going to...

2562
02:19:58,120 --> 02:19:59,080
Tim Tower!

2563
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:05,380
Heya, Minto.

2564
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:06,420
Heya, Duke.

2565
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:09,780
What kind of music do you like?

2566
02:20:10,460 --> 02:20:11,560
Pretty much anything.

2567
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:14,360
Let me see what you have.

2568
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:16,260
Oh cool, this is Groovy.

2569
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:18,440
Wait, do we get a new CD?

2570
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:21,600
I wanna listen to Groovy.

2571
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:23,420
Carvin, welcome to membership.

2572
02:20:23,620 --> 02:20:24,580
Thank you so much!

2573
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:27,960
Photoshop will take a camera but not the coke.

2574
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:29,660
What am I supposed to do with this anyway?

2575
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:34,920
What do I... What do I do with that?

2576
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:38,240
Behind large truck.

2577
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:44,010
Use it.

2578
02:20:44,610 --> 02:20:45,370
I'm stressed.

2579
02:20:45,650 --> 02:20:46,890
I'm stressed behind the truck.

2580
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:49,470
What kind of music do I like?

2581
02:20:50,930 --> 02:20:51,490
Anything.

2582
02:20:53,210 --> 02:20:56,410
Honestly though, I really do like just...

2583
02:20:56,410 --> 02:20:59,390
If I vibe with it, I don't mind it.

2584
02:21:00,690 --> 02:21:02,430
It's pretty much my philosophy.

2585
02:21:09,930 --> 02:21:11,750
What's threatening me?

2586
02:21:16,210 --> 02:21:17,950
Oh my god, finally!

2587
02:21:20,390 --> 02:21:22,630
Oh my god, it worked!

2588
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:27,150
The dog has reached level 3!

2589
02:21:28,850 --> 02:21:30,310
And the girl has 2 maybe?

2590
02:21:31,890 --> 02:21:33,590
Same TBH, it depends on my mood.

2591
02:21:33,670 --> 02:21:34,910
Yeah, yeah, me too.

2592
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:39,630
Speaking of music, dang it!

2593
02:21:39,750 --> 02:21:41,510
I wanted to play the music.

2594
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:44,530
Can I put on some music?

2595
02:21:44,590 --> 02:21:45,190
I'm sad.

2596
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:46,670
Why am I... Oh, because of the girl.

2597
02:21:47,490 --> 02:21:50,130
This girl is really souring my mood.

2598
02:21:51,430 --> 02:21:52,610
I'm sick of her!

2599
02:21:53,030 --> 02:21:54,070
Oh my gosh, fetch!

2600
02:21:54,830 --> 02:21:55,930
Fetch boy, fetch!

2601
02:21:59,450 --> 02:22:02,430
Can I kick her out or...

2602
02:22:05,310 --> 02:22:07,850
Can I just get her out of my car?

2603
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:13,360
Yeah, you can?

2604
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:14,080
Okay, good.

2605
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:17,040
There's Debbie Downer over here.

2606
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:20,600
I wish I had 2 blues.

2607
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:21,980
I wish I had the spray can.

2608
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:24,220
Oh man.

2609
02:22:26,660 --> 02:22:28,780
We're just gonna do the 3 random threats.

2610
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:31,620
Since there were so many that were gonna hurt us.

2611
02:22:35,590 --> 02:22:37,450
Yeah, I think the dog...

2612
02:22:37,450 --> 02:22:40,070
I think the guy with the dog kind of like...

2613
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:42,310
You have to...

2614
02:22:43,270 --> 02:22:46,070
You have to... What's the word?

2615
02:22:46,550 --> 02:22:47,610
Stick with it, you know?

2616
02:22:48,310 --> 02:22:49,850
Because obviously at first you're just like...

2617
02:22:49,850 --> 02:22:52,630
Oh my gosh, this dog takes up all this space and doesn't do anything.

2618
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:53,750
But then he becomes good.

2619
02:22:54,050 --> 02:22:54,650
Oh, you're right!

2620
02:22:54,690 --> 02:22:55,730
It's not raining anymore!

2621
02:22:56,650 --> 02:22:57,050
Yippee!

2622
02:22:58,430 --> 02:23:00,550
You have to have patience with the dog.

2623
02:23:01,070 --> 02:23:02,410
You gotta invest in the punk.

2624
02:23:03,230 --> 02:23:04,610
Even though he's kind of a jerk.

2625
02:23:05,110 --> 02:23:06,270
Do dogs go to heaven?

2626
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:07,750
Yeah, of course.

2627
02:23:08,850 --> 02:23:10,650
They're all good through and through.

2628
02:23:10,850 --> 02:23:11,730
Just bad owners.

2629
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,710
Yeah, exactly.

2630
02:23:13,950 --> 02:23:14,490
Wait.

2631
02:23:16,410 --> 02:23:17,450
We just...

2632
02:23:17,450 --> 02:23:19,750
We just negated all of our...

2633
02:23:22,770 --> 02:23:25,730
We just negated all of our...

2634
02:23:25,730 --> 02:23:27,830
Okay, it's time for you to leave.

2635
02:23:28,690 --> 02:23:29,570
Wait a second.

2636
02:23:29,990 --> 02:23:30,610
What is this?

2637
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:32,950
When you gain a positive status, you also gain...

2638
02:23:32,950 --> 02:23:34,270
Oh yeah, it's time for you to leave.

2639
02:23:34,870 --> 02:23:35,190
Goodbye.

2640
02:23:40,790 --> 02:23:41,950
Is that her?

2641
02:23:43,450 --> 02:23:46,050
I just made her homeless, I think.

2642
02:23:46,570 --> 02:23:47,050
Sorry!

2643
02:23:48,250 --> 02:23:50,170
You're just too bad of a vibe.

2644
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:54,670
You're just...

2645
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:58,250
You're just not a lot of fun, okay?

2646
02:24:01,410 --> 02:24:02,150
Sorry!

2647
02:24:03,190 --> 02:24:04,930
It is definitely you.

2648
02:24:04,930 --> 02:24:06,690
Like, it's not like a...

2649
02:24:06,690 --> 02:24:08,270
It's not you, it's me.

2650
02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:11,610
Is this...

2651
02:24:11,610 --> 02:24:12,210
Interior.

2652
02:24:13,970 --> 02:24:14,270
Engine?

2653
02:24:15,550 --> 02:24:18,210
Whenever you remove a random threat...

2654
02:24:18,210 --> 02:24:19,450
A random amount of...

2655
02:24:19,450 --> 02:24:23,930
Whenever you remove a random amount of threat, remove one more...

2656
02:24:24,850 --> 02:24:26,670
We finally got stuff for the engine.

2657
02:24:28,430 --> 02:24:30,270
What do we have...

2658
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:31,090
This is the roof.

2659
02:24:31,770 --> 02:24:33,490
Do we have anything in here for the roof?

2660
02:24:34,030 --> 02:24:35,870
Roof, roof, roof...

2661
02:24:35,870 --> 02:24:36,730
Oh wait, there's another.

2662
02:24:37,490 --> 02:24:38,210
There's another one.

2663
02:24:38,330 --> 02:24:38,850
Hold on, what's this?

2664
02:24:39,010 --> 02:24:43,850
When you play a skill from the driving skill tree, change a random threat to a note.

2665
02:24:46,650 --> 02:24:48,130
Also, portable stove.

2666
02:24:48,890 --> 02:24:50,650
Make certain food items inedible.

2667
02:24:51,650 --> 02:24:52,570
This is also an engine.

2668
02:24:52,950 --> 02:24:55,610
Increases max durability by 4 when you pass your turn.

2669
02:24:55,730 --> 02:24:56,430
Destroy one ra...

2670
02:24:56,430 --> 02:24:58,790
Destroy one random threat.

2671
02:24:58,790 --> 02:24:58,830
What?

2672
02:25:01,610 --> 02:25:03,190
And we got a roof!

2673
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:06,310
Wait, this is awesome.

2674
02:25:06,890 --> 02:25:09,070
You guys, we got two upgrades we can do.

2675
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:09,770
Hello?

2676
02:25:12,170 --> 02:25:14,430
And the winch.

2677
02:25:15,410 --> 02:25:17,290
Is this a winch?

2678
02:25:19,330 --> 02:25:20,710
We could cook the mushrooms?

2679
02:25:20,870 --> 02:25:22,830
No way, don't say that.

2680
02:25:23,530 --> 02:25:24,530
I like them raw.

2681
02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:24,610
Raw.

2682
02:25:27,390 --> 02:25:30,790
We have more space for berries!

2683
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:37,150
Look at all these berries.

2684
02:25:37,550 --> 02:25:39,230
All this space for berries.

2685
02:25:40,070 --> 02:25:41,610
All this space for berries.

2686
02:25:45,550 --> 02:25:46,950
Okay, so we got that.

2687
02:25:47,610 --> 02:25:48,910
And then let's go back.

2688
02:25:49,090 --> 02:25:50,830
I don't know which engine to get though.

2689
02:25:52,270 --> 02:25:53,310
That's tough.

2690
02:25:53,310 --> 02:25:56,150
We finally have a... wait, utility?

2691
02:26:11,390 --> 02:26:13,790
I like improved brakes.

2692
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:19,780
Wait, where's the improved brakes?

2693
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:23,880
Carburetor?

2694
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:29,620
Doesn't the carburetor synergize with punk?

2695
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:32,660
Whenever you remove a random...

2696
02:26:32,660 --> 02:26:34,840
Oh, that's what it means.

2697
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:38,900
So when I remove a random, like the three amount...

2698
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:41,820
The only thing about that skill is he has it just only twice.

2699
02:26:42,480 --> 02:26:44,140
So, the circle.

2700
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:44,780
Oh, this thing.

2701
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:46,260
No, this is turbo.

2702
02:26:51,170 --> 02:26:51,690
Subwoofer?

2703
02:26:52,530 --> 02:26:53,230
That's speakers.

2704
02:26:54,090 --> 02:26:56,390
Boost the bass frequencies of music.

2705
02:26:58,350 --> 02:26:59,750
Very important, yeah.

2706
02:27:00,070 --> 02:27:02,850
We have an actual AC that we could get.

2707
02:27:03,570 --> 02:27:04,490
What is that?

2708
02:27:04,770 --> 02:27:05,850
Is this...

2709
02:27:06,590 --> 02:27:09,810
I can't tell if it replaces this or not.

2710
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:11,550
AC might be kind of nice.

2711
02:27:11,610 --> 02:27:13,690
Because we get cold quite often though.

2712
02:27:14,690 --> 02:27:15,530
Get the AC.

2713
02:27:17,810 --> 02:27:19,810
How would you describe this game?

2714
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:24,850
It's like Oregon Trail meets...

2715
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:29,340
What's a roguelike?

2716
02:27:32,380 --> 02:27:36,000
AC would replace the Lurv, but it's probably worse.

2717
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:36,740
I think so too.

2718
02:27:39,620 --> 02:27:40,900
Dave the Diver?

2719
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:42,880
I don't... Maybe?

2720
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:44,480
Bellatro?

2721
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:47,860
I don't think this game is so much like Bellatro though.

2722
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:51,360
But yeah.

2723
02:27:52,060 --> 02:27:53,900
Slay the Spire, maybe?

2724
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:56,600
I haven't played it.

2725
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:57,920
So I don't know.

2726
02:27:57,920 --> 02:28:00,640
I think I will get the AC.

2727
02:28:02,660 --> 02:28:04,400
I think we will upgrade.

2728
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:09,160
Because we have the sunglasses, I don't think we need this.

2729
02:28:09,240 --> 02:28:12,060
It is nice having the plus 2 durability, but...

2730
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:16,180
We've been pretty okay with how we've been.

2731
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:17,900
Oh wait, I just noticed the roll cage.

2732
02:28:18,820 --> 02:28:20,760
Increases max durability by 4.

2733
02:28:22,260 --> 02:28:23,300
Oh, I see.

2734
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:24,240
Oh,

2735
02:28:27,660 --> 02:28:31,140
here it is.

2736
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:34,220
Increases max durability by 4 when you pass your turn destroyed.

2737
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:37,820
I think maybe the improved breaks will be good.

2738
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:42,140
Oh my gosh, we're finally...

2739
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:44,860
Look at us guys, look at us.

2740
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:47,020
We are killing it.

2741
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:51,260
There we go.

2742
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:53,180
No more cold, no more heat.

2743
02:28:55,300 --> 02:28:56,840
And I am gonna sell...

2744
02:28:56,840 --> 02:28:58,760
I see this in the shops all the time.

2745
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:00,760
Literally, it's right there.

2746
02:29:00,920 --> 02:29:02,580
So I'm going to sell you.

2747
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:04,320
Okay.

2748
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:05,760
Alright.

2749
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:09,320
We almost have a full...

2750
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:14,660
We almost have a full back row of goodies.

2751
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:21,500
We have...

2752
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:22,860
We're sad.

2753
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:24,520
Why are we so sad?

2754
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,480
Why are we so sad?

2755
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:30,540
Oh, this is not our pizza, this is the quest pizza.

2756
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:32,560
Don't get it, don't get it mistaken.

2757
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:34,000
We have free pizza.

2758
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:35,600
No, no, no, we're not gonna eat that.

2759
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:38,480
Utility back.

2760
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:41,160
Does nothing.

2761
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:42,860
Oh, why would I buy it then?

2762
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:44,200
For the aesthetics?

2763
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:49,940
You black out while driving.

2764
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:51,820
Oh, is that how it happens?

2765
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:55,400
You've made so much more room in your car for porn.

2766
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:58,700
I hope we don't get caught.

2767
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:04,820
They would either be very concerned or they'd be like...

2768
02:30:05,580 --> 02:30:09,060
Okay, we're going to free run now.

2769
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:12,580
Did I need to sleep?

2770
02:30:16,140 --> 02:30:17,980
Oh no, do you smell that?

2771
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:19,900
She dropped the bomb.

2772
02:30:21,480 --> 02:30:23,400
BD, open all windows.

2773
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:26,720
We got rid of the girl.

2774
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:29,220
Tony, welcome to Mambo Ship.

2775
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:30,400
Thank you so much.

2776
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:31,040
Thank you, thank you.

2777
02:30:35,170 --> 02:30:36,470
Beyond journeys end.

2778
02:30:37,970 --> 02:30:38,470
Roadkill!

2779
02:30:38,930 --> 02:30:39,590
Oh no.

2780
02:30:40,430 --> 02:30:42,070
Why did we stop for the roadkill?

2781
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:43,230
This is so messed up.

2782
02:30:43,810 --> 02:30:45,470
I don't understand this event at all.

2783
02:30:48,850 --> 02:30:49,550
Let's see.

2784
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:50,710
Let's get rid of this.

2785
02:30:50,710 --> 02:30:51,710
Yeah.

2786
02:30:52,990 --> 02:30:53,550
Ouch.

2787
02:30:53,790 --> 02:30:54,610
Oh my gosh.

2788
02:30:56,530 --> 02:30:57,650
Free food.

2789
02:30:58,110 --> 02:30:58,670
Ewww.

2790
02:31:01,110 --> 02:31:02,130
Holy moly.

2791
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:18,340
Dang it, I was hoping it would get rid of sad.

2792
02:31:19,220 --> 02:31:20,860
I was hoping it would get rid of sad.

2793
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:23,640
So that we could have an extra turn.

2794
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:27,280
We're brawling with the roadkill.

2795
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:29,720
This is so stupid.

2796
02:31:36,830 --> 02:31:37,670
It's okay.

2797
02:31:37,790 --> 02:31:38,870
We're about to make some money.

2798
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:46,150
So honestly, we'll just get to the town and sleep and deliver.

2799
02:31:46,790 --> 02:31:48,690
I think we'll be okay, actually.

2800
02:31:50,050 --> 02:31:51,070
We really...

2801
02:31:51,070 --> 02:31:52,630
Good girl.

2802
02:31:52,950 --> 02:31:54,330
Yeah, that's a good girl.

2803
02:31:54,670 --> 02:31:55,230
Here you go.

2804
02:31:55,410 --> 02:31:55,970
Take it.

2805
02:31:56,070 --> 02:31:56,850
What did you just give her?

2806
02:31:59,730 --> 02:32:00,630
Little dog?

2807
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:02,570
Or big dog?

2808
02:32:06,490 --> 02:32:08,450
She didn't just give her the coke and all.

2809
02:32:08,810 --> 02:32:10,490
Okay, we still have it.

2810
02:32:12,070 --> 02:32:13,770
I'm happy I took this road.

2811
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:16,070
Look out the door window.

2812
02:32:18,210 --> 02:32:20,030
The open fields that...

2813
02:32:20,030 --> 02:32:20,310
Nowhere.

2814
02:32:21,150 --> 02:32:23,610
The clouds, the sky and the color of it all.

2815
02:32:24,830 --> 02:32:25,390
Wow.

2816
02:32:26,390 --> 02:32:27,850
We gained nothing from that.

2817
02:32:30,390 --> 02:32:31,870
I don't miss real.

2818
02:32:32,670 --> 02:32:33,410
Oh there's the...

2819
02:32:33,410 --> 02:32:34,130
Wow.

2820
02:32:34,990 --> 02:32:36,850
There's the open fields.

2821
02:32:37,010 --> 02:32:37,970
Flock of sheep.

2822
02:32:38,990 --> 02:32:39,450
Oops, sorry.

2823
02:32:42,510 --> 02:32:44,870
Everybody else is running by them.

2824
02:32:47,770 --> 02:32:48,970
Use the dog.

2825
02:32:50,570 --> 02:32:51,790
Okay, thank goodness.

2826
02:32:57,830 --> 02:32:58,890
There we go.

2827
02:32:59,790 --> 02:33:00,310
Ouch.

2828
02:33:05,960 --> 02:33:07,200
Use the dog.

2829
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:13,080
Actually, dog has no more for this one.

2830
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:15,800
It's okay, we got...

2831
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:22,920
It's okay, we'll be alright.

2832
02:33:23,300 --> 02:33:24,600
I'll use the cigarettes on this one.

2833
02:33:24,860 --> 02:33:26,840
Oh yeah, that's right, we get an extra turn now.

2834
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:27,520
Yay!

2835
02:33:27,980 --> 02:33:30,160
I've smoked 14 cigarettes!

2836
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:32,160
When using cigarettes, consume...

2837
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:36,080
Two instead of one.

2838
02:33:58,180 --> 02:33:59,360
You got my pizza?

2839
02:34:04,760 --> 02:34:06,040
I'm so mad.

2840
02:34:06,220 --> 02:34:07,380
Why does this game hate me?

2841
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:11,840
Pizza is my passion in life.

2842
02:34:12,620 --> 02:34:13,660
So true!

2843
02:34:16,580 --> 02:34:18,000
Why does he hate?

2844
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:19,060
Why does he hate?

2845
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:20,320
Why does this game hate me?

2846
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:25,660
Hold on.

2847
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:27,260
That was so weird.

2848
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:28,040
Wait, hold on.

2849
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:32,480
My phone started going crazy all of a sudden.

2850
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:42,720
I'm okay.

2851
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:48,960
I guess we don't need anything.

2852
02:34:50,320 --> 02:34:52,380
And let's just get some more gas.

2853
02:34:53,340 --> 02:34:54,320
Oops, my bad.

2854
02:34:56,180 --> 02:34:58,860
We can get up to like 75%.

2855
02:34:58,860 --> 02:34:59,680
There we go.

2856
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:00,740
20 bucks.

2857
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:06,520
Okay, and...

2858
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:08,380
Next we have to go to...

2859
02:35:12,800 --> 02:35:13,480
Here.

2860
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:14,300
What was here?

2861
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:16,720
What was...

2862
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:18,020
Oh wait, I gotta sleep first.

2863
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:19,000
Maybe.

2864
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:20,180
Sleep.

2865
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:24,820
We're hungry.

2866
02:35:25,400 --> 02:35:25,960
No, no, no.

2867
02:35:26,020 --> 02:35:26,560
We're not hungry.

2868
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:29,100
Do you know how many berries are in this truck?

2869
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:32,960
Actually, we're running low on berries.

2870
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:36,700
We're actually kind of running low.

2871
02:35:40,530 --> 02:35:41,890
But we have lots of pizza.

2872
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:43,190
We have the most pizza.

2873
02:35:45,630 --> 02:35:46,970
You have to get to 61.

2874
02:35:47,390 --> 02:35:47,790
Yeah.

2875
02:35:50,030 --> 02:35:51,410
But what was this quest?

2876
02:35:51,510 --> 02:35:51,930
I don't remember.

2877
02:35:52,090 --> 02:35:53,090
61 is down here.

2878
02:35:53,090 --> 02:35:55,730
And Hungrad is where we get the concert ticket.

2879
02:35:56,190 --> 02:35:56,970
So honestly...

2880
02:35:56,970 --> 02:35:58,670
And then we just go up here.

2881
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,430
And we're at the concert.

2882
02:36:00,710 --> 02:36:01,190
The festival.

2883
02:36:01,710 --> 02:36:02,370
So we're actually...

2884
02:36:02,370 --> 02:36:03,170
But what is here?

2885
02:36:06,290 --> 02:36:07,290
Punk club?

2886
02:36:07,890 --> 02:36:08,710
Eastern city.

2887
02:36:15,330 --> 02:36:15,930
Grandma?

2888
02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:17,050
I think she's dead.

2889
02:36:20,550 --> 02:36:21,150
61.

2890
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:22,310
The great race.

2891
02:36:22,310 --> 02:36:22,850
We've...

2892
02:36:25,190 --> 02:36:25,890
Oh, wait.

2893
02:36:26,250 --> 02:36:27,230
We can get a ticket here.

2894
02:36:28,010 --> 02:36:29,370
We can get a ticket out here.

2895
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:31,210
And find a tent along the way.

2896
02:36:31,990 --> 02:36:32,630
We've got this.

2897
02:36:32,670 --> 02:36:33,230
We've got this.

2898
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:38,460
That was the beer mission.

2899
02:36:40,020 --> 02:36:41,240
I think you're right.

2900
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:42,100
That's right.

2901
02:36:42,660 --> 02:36:45,720
If only I had the little card on top.

2902
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:47,660
We would have been able to do it.

2903
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:51,460
I think grandma is gone.

2904
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:56,180
Wow, Esper.

2905
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:58,480
Thank you so much for the 20 gift.

2906
02:36:58,660 --> 02:36:59,420
Thank you.

2907
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,500
Slow driving area.

2908
02:37:05,720 --> 02:37:06,900
Why is...

2909
02:37:06,900 --> 02:37:08,360
Why does this exist?

2910
02:37:09,580 --> 02:37:11,180
Why does this exist?

2911
02:37:16,510 --> 02:37:18,030
Hold on.

2912
02:37:18,070 --> 02:37:18,790
I'm gonna try this.

2913
02:37:22,270 --> 02:37:23,030
And...

2914
02:37:23,030 --> 02:37:23,470
Dog.

2915
02:37:24,010 --> 02:37:24,410
Bark.

2916
02:37:29,580 --> 02:37:30,800
We're losing gas.

2917
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:33,080
OK.

2918
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,580
And then...

2919
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:35,820
Bam!

2920
02:37:36,740 --> 02:37:37,720
What did I get?

2921
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:39,100
I'm hungry again?

2922
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:41,860
Oh, I forgot the music.

2923
02:37:41,980 --> 02:37:42,700
Guys, I keep forgetting.

2924
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:44,380
You can say something if I forget it.

2925
02:37:50,370 --> 02:37:51,550
Eat the banana.

2926
02:37:56,040 --> 02:37:56,980
Wait, hold on.

2927
02:37:58,380 --> 02:37:58,780
Eject!

2928
02:37:59,460 --> 02:38:00,280
Let's make a...

2929
02:38:00,280 --> 02:38:01,620
Let's make a shuffle tape.

2930
02:38:01,980 --> 02:38:02,460
There we go.

2931
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:06,700
I keep saying it.

2932
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:07,560
You keep not reading.

2933
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:09,300
I keep playing the game!

2934
02:38:12,100 --> 02:38:13,680
I'm playing the game.

2935
02:38:14,500 --> 02:38:14,760
Wait.

2936
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:16,560
Crystal boys.

2937
02:38:17,300 --> 02:38:18,140
That's a new one.

2938
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:19,520
Wow, we're in the city.

2939
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:26,280
Anyone remember the rip grandma default dance clip?

2940
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:28,060
Wait, we're lost?

2941
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:34,350
And all of my hitchhikers are asleep.

2942
02:38:34,590 --> 02:38:35,730
Oh my gosh, the question marks.

2943
02:38:37,910 --> 02:38:38,450
I'm lost.

2944
02:38:38,550 --> 02:38:39,650
Wait, is even the dog asleep?

2945
02:38:39,790 --> 02:38:41,110
Even the dog is asleep!

2946
02:38:44,990 --> 02:38:47,350
Oh no, wake up please!

2947
02:38:47,710 --> 02:38:48,670
I'm lost.

2948
02:38:51,190 --> 02:38:52,630
This is so silly.

2949
02:39:07,330 --> 02:39:09,210
I hope I don't get pulled over.

2950
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:17,820
I didn't mean to.

2951
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:21,000
Am I going to hell?

2952
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:34,610
What does this mean?

2953
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:51,460
Now we're fast and lost.

2954
02:39:52,240 --> 02:39:54,220
No, we're in the slow driving area.

2955
02:39:54,380 --> 02:39:55,480
That's the worst thing we want.

2956
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:56,960
Wait, lose energy?

2957
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:57,660
I couldn't read it.

2958
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:59,000
It went away too fast.

2959
02:40:06,930 --> 02:40:07,390
Okay.

2960
02:40:08,050 --> 02:40:08,450
Cool.

2961
02:40:10,330 --> 02:40:10,790
Dog.

2962
02:40:11,490 --> 02:40:11,950
Bark.

2963
02:40:12,110 --> 02:40:12,650
I mean fetch.

2964
02:40:12,650 --> 02:40:12,710
Fetch.

2965
02:40:15,890 --> 02:40:16,450
And...

2966
02:40:16,450 --> 02:40:17,330
Bark.

2967
02:40:18,050 --> 02:40:18,470
Bark.

2968
02:40:22,670 --> 02:40:24,130
All the hitchhikers are asleep.

2969
02:40:26,110 --> 02:40:27,470
It says it in the mirror.

2970
02:40:27,550 --> 02:40:28,070
Oh, that's right.

2971
02:40:28,130 --> 02:40:28,510
The mirror.

2972
02:40:28,970 --> 02:40:30,930
Energy cost decreased by 5.

2973
02:40:31,050 --> 02:40:32,310
Lose energy after road event.

2974
02:40:33,030 --> 02:40:34,010
Make this last.

2975
02:40:34,430 --> 02:40:35,290
Oh no.

2976
02:40:40,470 --> 02:40:41,530
Got it.

2977
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:51,820
We're going for a jar of eggs.

2978
02:40:53,860 --> 02:40:55,500
And we are in the zone.

2979
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:56,780
In the zone.

2980
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,060
And we're in...

2981
02:40:58,060 --> 02:40:59,640
No, we're not in the zone anymore.

2982
02:41:01,980 --> 02:41:02,860
What is this?

2983
02:41:03,580 --> 02:41:03,900
Hello.

2984
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:06,200
Good night, Minky and fellow Wisps.

2985
02:41:06,300 --> 02:41:07,940
Gonna watch the VOD tomorrow while I work.

2986
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:08,620
Thanks for the stream.

2987
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:09,320
Good luck with the drive.

2988
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:10,580
Thanks, Jpax.

2989
02:41:12,220 --> 02:41:13,820
Oh, I got your ticket for the festival.

2990
02:41:13,820 --> 02:41:13,860
Festival.

2991
02:41:17,630 --> 02:41:19,660
Ticket to the Way Out Festival.

2992
02:41:20,940 --> 02:41:22,440
We got it!

2993
02:41:28,540 --> 02:41:32,880
This is the garage mechanic and this is the talking person.

2994
02:41:33,860 --> 02:41:35,920
Hey, wanna buy some nice stuff?

2995
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:40,880
Dang it!

2996
02:41:42,280 --> 02:41:45,040
What do you mean he won't accept it?

2997
02:41:48,670 --> 02:41:50,070
We got worms.

2998
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:51,930
We got worm graffiti.

2999
02:41:53,370 --> 02:41:54,810
A crowbar.

3000
02:41:58,030 --> 02:41:58,770
Graffiti.

3001
02:42:00,770 --> 02:42:01,210
Gun?

3002
02:42:02,110 --> 02:42:04,830
Better not get caught having it near us.

3003
02:42:04,830 --> 02:42:05,670
It's in red.

3004
02:42:06,350 --> 02:42:07,770
You guys, it's in...

3005
02:42:07,770 --> 02:42:08,450
It's scary.

3006
02:42:08,530 --> 02:42:09,090
What's this one?

3007
02:42:09,930 --> 02:42:10,570
Butterfly knife.

3008
02:42:10,610 --> 02:42:12,270
Oh, I thought it was a party popper.

3009
02:42:14,970 --> 02:42:19,670
Actually, the knife might come in handy for the roadkill.

3010
02:42:21,370 --> 02:42:22,430
What is the gun for?

3011
02:42:23,650 --> 02:42:25,850
Hopefully you'll never have to use it.

3012
02:42:28,250 --> 02:42:30,090
Why won't this guy take my...

3013
02:42:30,630 --> 02:42:32,230
He only wants to sell it.

3014
02:42:32,270 --> 02:42:33,210
He doesn't wanna...

3015
02:42:33,210 --> 02:42:34,270
Just combine it!

3016
02:42:39,490 --> 02:42:43,050
I like the green worm.

3017
02:42:44,070 --> 02:42:45,510
What is this one and this one?

3018
02:42:48,550 --> 02:42:50,350
Is this an upside down star?

3019
02:42:50,650 --> 02:42:51,870
I don't get this one either.

3020
02:42:52,810 --> 02:42:53,650
It's just an X?

3021
02:42:54,130 --> 02:42:54,730
How lazy.

3022
02:42:55,910 --> 02:42:57,030
Probably because it's a U.

3023
02:42:57,290 --> 02:42:58,550
I didn't mean to!

3024
02:43:00,870 --> 02:43:03,030
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

3025
02:43:09,270 --> 02:43:11,090
Let's put a...

3026
02:43:11,090 --> 02:43:11,710
This one.

3027
02:43:11,770 --> 02:43:13,410
Actually, I don't know what this one says either.

3028
02:43:13,890 --> 02:43:15,390
Let's put a purple worm.

3029
02:43:15,770 --> 02:43:16,010
Wait.

3030
02:43:16,630 --> 02:43:18,190
Let's put a green snake.

3031
02:43:22,830 --> 02:43:23,450
And the gun.

3032
02:43:23,770 --> 02:43:27,430
If we hide the gun on the rooftop...

3033
02:43:27,430 --> 02:43:28,710
Do you think it would be fine?

3034
02:43:33,050 --> 02:43:34,730
I am gonna get the crowbar.

3035
02:43:35,250 --> 02:43:36,270
And the knife.

3036
02:43:37,050 --> 02:43:38,570
This is our illegal stash.

3037
02:43:42,690 --> 02:43:43,170
Right?

3038
02:43:46,010 --> 02:43:47,530
Hide the coke up there too.

3039
02:43:49,070 --> 02:43:49,830
Illegal stash.

3040
02:43:53,530 --> 02:43:53,910
No,

3041
02:43:57,350 --> 02:43:57,670
no, no.

3042
02:43:57,730 --> 02:43:58,330
I'm not selling.

3043
02:43:59,030 --> 02:44:00,910
I was gonna try and move them all up in here.

3044
02:44:03,310 --> 02:44:04,950
But also they will get wet.

3045
02:44:06,950 --> 02:44:08,010
I'm scared you guys.

3046
02:44:08,090 --> 02:44:10,110
I get pulled over by the cops all the time.

3047
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:11,890
What do I do?

3048
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:13,590
We are so close to the end.

3049
02:44:15,550 --> 02:44:17,150
It's also very expensive.

3050
02:44:27,770 --> 02:44:29,750
I'm gonna... Sorry guys.

3051
02:44:30,030 --> 02:44:31,050
I'm gonna weenie out.

3052
02:44:31,190 --> 02:44:31,810
I'm sorry.

3053
02:44:32,030 --> 02:44:34,510
I'm weenieing out.

3054
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:36,150
Oh.

3055
02:44:36,690 --> 02:44:37,170
Hey, hey.

3056
02:44:37,490 --> 02:44:37,910
Sorry.

3057
02:44:38,310 --> 02:44:39,050
You got some change?

3058
02:44:39,910 --> 02:44:40,770
One buck?

3059
02:44:41,230 --> 02:44:42,230
I can give a buck.

3060
02:44:43,490 --> 02:44:44,690
Appreciate it.

3061
02:44:45,450 --> 02:44:45,650
Oh.

3062
02:44:46,530 --> 02:44:47,050
You're welcome.

3063
02:44:50,270 --> 02:44:50,750
Explore?

3064
02:44:51,050 --> 02:44:54,370
This looks mighty... This place is huge also.

3065
02:44:55,810 --> 02:44:56,990
We have a hotel.

3066
02:44:57,210 --> 02:44:57,550
Oh cool.

3067
02:44:57,650 --> 02:44:58,610
We can sleep in there.

3068
02:44:59,270 --> 02:44:59,750
Employment.

3069
02:45:02,150 --> 02:45:02,630
Hi.

3070
02:45:03,690 --> 02:45:04,930
Are you also going to the festival?

3071
02:45:05,370 --> 02:45:07,410
You should totally check out this band that's playing there.

3072
02:45:07,990 --> 02:45:08,690
Oh, nice.

3073
02:45:12,250 --> 02:45:13,210
Zimmer Grandioso.

3074
02:45:14,930 --> 02:45:15,410
Nice.

3075
02:45:17,310 --> 02:45:19,050
Oh, thank you for the brain.

3076
02:45:20,670 --> 02:45:21,870
Salvi, thank you.

3077
02:45:23,850 --> 02:45:26,250
This place is humongous.

3078
02:45:27,250 --> 02:45:28,390
This car is insured, right?

3079
02:45:29,630 --> 02:45:30,270
Probably.

3080
02:45:33,950 --> 02:45:35,130
A tent!

3081
02:45:35,450 --> 02:45:36,210
Oh my gosh.

3082
02:45:36,470 --> 02:45:37,310
Oh my gosh.

3083
02:45:39,330 --> 02:45:39,690
Wait.

3084
02:45:42,830 --> 02:45:45,050
We have basically...

3085
02:45:45,050 --> 02:45:47,250
Can I rotate it?

3086
02:45:47,390 --> 02:45:48,130
An amplifier.

3087
02:45:49,290 --> 02:45:49,830
A book.

3088
02:45:51,450 --> 02:45:52,470
Spend some time reading.

3089
02:45:52,630 --> 02:45:55,690
When the book is finished, you might feel something.

3090
02:45:55,790 --> 02:45:56,770
Is that not a bible?

3091
02:45:57,070 --> 02:45:57,970
A tambourine!

3092
02:45:58,070 --> 02:45:59,290
A lucky cat!

3093
02:45:59,930 --> 02:46:00,730
Increases luck.

3094
02:46:00,770 --> 02:46:01,310
I need that.

3095
02:46:01,570 --> 02:46:01,770
Wait.

3096
02:46:01,830 --> 02:46:02,430
More books.

3097
02:46:05,770 --> 02:46:07,390
What is that book?

3098
02:46:08,890 --> 02:46:10,010
A knife.

3099
02:46:11,630 --> 02:46:13,630
A rooster with a jacket.

3100
02:46:13,630 --> 02:46:16,330
Do you like hurting people?

3101
02:46:16,730 --> 02:46:17,770
What does that mean?

3102
02:46:18,970 --> 02:46:20,010
Strong liquor.

3103
02:46:20,550 --> 02:46:21,570
Seems deep.

3104
02:46:22,190 --> 02:46:23,230
Seems popular.

3105
02:46:24,190 --> 02:46:25,270
I need the tent.

3106
02:46:27,510 --> 02:46:29,290
I guess I can't put it in here.

3107
02:46:29,510 --> 02:46:30,570
I have to put it in the trunk.

3108
02:46:30,650 --> 02:46:31,150
That sucks.

3109
02:46:33,690 --> 02:46:36,070
I hate that I can't move things from...

3110
02:46:36,070 --> 02:46:41,790
At least I have not figured out how I move things from my trunk into the top space.

3111
02:46:43,630 --> 02:46:45,310
What's Hotline Miami reference?

3112
02:46:47,310 --> 02:46:48,690
Oh a CD!

3113
02:46:49,210 --> 02:46:50,310
It's red as fwa.

3114
02:46:56,260 --> 02:46:57,920
Oh man!

3115
02:47:05,050 --> 02:47:05,930
No!

3116
02:47:06,950 --> 02:47:08,970
I thought it was K-On!

3117
02:47:10,130 --> 02:47:11,510
Fwa fwa time!

3118
02:47:11,710 --> 02:47:12,870
Fwa fwa time!

3119
02:47:14,830 --> 02:47:17,490
I don't want this!

3120
02:47:19,250 --> 02:47:20,410
Oh man!

3121
02:47:24,090 --> 02:47:25,250
So...Oh move!

3122
02:47:26,810 --> 02:47:28,570
Thank you guys!

3123
02:47:29,210 --> 02:47:30,490
So that's how you do it.

3124
02:47:34,410 --> 02:47:35,850
I wish I could...

3125
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:38,430
Rotate.

3126
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:39,870
And then move.

3127
02:47:41,450 --> 02:47:42,010
There we go.

3128
02:47:42,330 --> 02:47:44,430
Actually I don't think that made any difference.

3129
02:47:44,570 --> 02:47:45,090
But that's okay.

3130
02:47:45,270 --> 02:47:46,950
It made a difference in my brain.

3131
02:47:47,810 --> 02:47:50,590
I gotta go put this on my car for real.

3132
02:47:51,290 --> 02:47:51,910
Let's see.

3133
02:47:52,010 --> 02:47:52,830
It seems exciting.

3134
02:47:52,930 --> 02:47:54,250
Let's get the exciting book.

3135
02:47:54,590 --> 02:47:55,550
Or the pizza.

3136
02:47:56,210 --> 02:47:56,650
Nope.

3137
02:47:57,030 --> 02:47:57,210
Nope.

3138
02:47:57,470 --> 02:47:58,930
That's our roommate.

3139
02:48:00,070 --> 02:48:00,510
Read.

3140
02:48:01,570 --> 02:48:01,830
Oh!

3141
02:48:02,150 --> 02:48:03,150
That takes a lot of time.

3142
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:09,160
Hi.

3143
02:48:09,780 --> 02:48:12,820
I hope this reaches you as I do not know if you saw the last letter we sent.

3144
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:19,360
I write now to regretfully inform you that your grandmother passed away last night at 5.21pm.

3145
02:48:20,380 --> 02:48:24,340
There was nothing we could do as the cancer had damaged so much internal tissue.

3146
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:27,160
She left you a message concerning your inheritance.

3147
02:48:27,860 --> 02:48:28,920
The address is attached.

3148
02:48:29,400 --> 02:48:30,620
Dr. Vaswani.

3149
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:32,400
Go to your land.

3150
02:48:34,900 --> 02:48:36,700
I have no other choice but...

3151
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:37,840
My land!

3152
02:48:38,460 --> 02:48:39,800
It's so far!

3153
02:48:40,340 --> 02:48:40,640
Wait.

3154
02:48:40,840 --> 02:48:42,260
I have to go all the way back home?

3155
02:48:44,260 --> 02:48:45,220
Sorry Gramps.

3156
02:48:45,400 --> 02:48:47,000
I got a festival to go to.

3157
02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:53,760
I didn't...

3158
02:48:54,340 --> 02:48:55,680
Well, at least the shops are still open.

3159
02:48:56,040 --> 02:48:56,540
Let's see.

3160
02:48:56,600 --> 02:48:57,580
What else do we got around here?

3161
02:48:57,700 --> 02:48:59,060
We have a place to explore.

3162
02:48:59,380 --> 02:49:00,080
A bar.

3163
02:49:00,940 --> 02:49:01,340
Moscat!

3164
02:49:04,240 --> 02:49:05,240
Location in free run.

3165
02:49:05,620 --> 02:49:07,120
Our cat Cookie is missing!

3166
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:09,520
I don't want to go back though.

3167
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:15,480
I want to keep going forward in the beer run at Tascow.

3168
02:49:16,720 --> 02:49:17,520
Where is that?

3169
02:49:20,140 --> 02:49:21,820
We got to go down this way.

3170
02:49:27,300 --> 02:49:28,980
Oh, it's all the way back here?

3171
02:49:29,080 --> 02:49:29,700
Oh, hell no.

3172
02:49:30,900 --> 02:49:33,000
What is up with these weirdo...

3173
02:49:37,160 --> 02:49:38,160
These strange...

3174
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:40,520
Beer runs and stuff.

3175
02:49:42,080 --> 02:49:43,380
Oh, it looks so bad.

3176
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:50,380
Our car looks so dingy and horrible.

3177
02:49:56,430 --> 02:50:00,390
Can they... If I repair it, will they like...

3178
02:50:00,390 --> 02:50:01,930
Will they...

3179
02:50:01,930 --> 02:50:03,490
Clean it too?

3180
02:50:07,690 --> 02:50:09,670
It looks so ugly!

3181
02:50:12,670 --> 02:50:14,710
It looks so bad!

3182
02:50:17,330 --> 02:50:18,490
I just turned 30 yesterday.

3183
02:50:18,630 --> 02:50:19,650
Mind if I get a birthday greeting?

3184
02:50:19,870 --> 02:50:20,650
Happy birthday!

3185
02:50:22,670 --> 02:50:23,710
The beard?

3186
02:50:24,010 --> 02:50:25,170
Is that how you say my name?

3187
02:50:28,330 --> 02:50:29,690
Happy birthday!

3188
02:50:46,750 --> 02:50:47,830
The bar.

3189
02:50:49,150 --> 02:50:50,250
What do they sell?

3190
02:50:50,370 --> 02:50:51,930
Wait, what kind of food do they sell there?

3191
02:50:55,190 --> 02:50:56,310
Chicken wings.

3192
02:50:57,510 --> 02:50:58,590
Cures starving.

3193
02:50:59,510 --> 02:51:01,270
I mean, you know what?

3194
02:51:01,370 --> 02:51:03,130
Honestly, yeah.

3195
02:51:04,130 --> 02:51:06,470
A good fries can cure all.

3196
02:51:07,610 --> 02:51:08,090
Nuts.

3197
02:51:10,330 --> 02:51:11,850
Beer, beer, beer, beer.

3198
02:51:13,330 --> 02:51:14,490
Jar of eggs.

3199
02:51:23,860 --> 02:51:24,500
Explore.

3200
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,120
Oh my god.

3201
02:51:27,560 --> 02:51:29,980
I might get shanked.

3202
02:51:31,740 --> 02:51:32,380
Sorry.

3203
02:51:34,660 --> 02:51:36,760
That's why I have the knife!

3204
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:49,560
They were going to mug me, but I mugged them first.

3205
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:57,240
This game is unbelievable a little bit.

3206
02:51:59,580 --> 02:52:03,980
I can't tell what is to be explored in, you know?

3207
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:06,760
This game is a little wacky.

3208
02:52:07,340 --> 02:52:08,840
I mean, I knew that, but you know.

3209
02:52:09,660 --> 02:52:10,700
The crowbar!

3210
02:52:11,460 --> 02:52:12,620
Oh my god.

3211
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:15,500
So that's why we needed those things.

3212
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:17,280
Are we out of the countryside now?

3213
02:52:17,380 --> 02:52:23,160
So we don't really need the flashlight and that kind of stuff anymore?

3214
02:52:25,720 --> 02:52:26,880
Everything looks the same.

3215
02:52:27,730 --> 02:52:29,200
I can't tell where I'm at.

3216
02:52:29,780 --> 02:52:30,280
Wait.

3217
02:52:31,160 --> 02:52:31,560
No.

3218
02:52:33,540 --> 02:52:34,200
Hello.

3219
02:52:35,060 --> 02:52:35,400
Hello.

3220
02:52:36,860 --> 02:52:38,100
I'm out of here.

3221
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:45,240
This is so strange!

3222
02:52:45,700 --> 02:52:47,520
I think that's all there is to it.

3223
02:52:49,060 --> 02:52:50,240
I think so.

3224
02:52:53,420 --> 02:52:54,240
Excuse me.

3225
02:52:54,360 --> 02:52:55,020
What's home?

3226
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:56,680
Where is home?

3227
02:52:57,680 --> 02:52:59,040
Where did I come from?

3228
02:52:59,540 --> 02:53:00,740
Where did I start from?

3229
02:53:02,020 --> 02:53:02,540
Where?

3230
02:53:02,980 --> 02:53:03,580
Is this here?

3231
02:53:03,740 --> 02:53:04,060
Oh, here.

3232
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:04,480
OK.

3233
02:53:05,100 --> 02:53:05,900
We got it.

3234
02:53:07,720 --> 02:53:08,240
Seriously?

3235
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:08,760
It's...

3236
02:53:08,760 --> 02:53:10,400
Oh my god.

3237
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:11,440
OK.

3238
02:53:11,580 --> 02:53:13,860
Let's take these and see if we can sell them this time.

3239
02:53:19,740 --> 02:53:21,000
They're brand new!

3240
02:53:22,520 --> 02:53:23,000
Asterisk.

3241
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:27,860
I have some...

3242
02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:28,080
Hey.

3243
02:53:28,560 --> 02:53:29,080
Hey, hey.

3244
02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:31,360
Are you kidding me for a minute?

3245
02:53:32,940 --> 02:53:34,860
What do I do with all this cocaine?

3246
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:41,580
What do I do with it?

3247
02:53:52,040 --> 02:53:53,380
What do I do?

3248
02:53:57,410 --> 02:53:59,450
It's a good thing I got the knife.

3249
02:54:03,090 --> 02:54:04,730
What do I do?

3250
02:54:17,350 --> 02:54:18,390
Kid sniffing!

3251
02:54:18,530 --> 02:54:18,650
No!

3252
02:54:21,100 --> 02:54:22,440
Oh wow, there's lots of things.

3253
02:54:22,600 --> 02:54:23,460
Game tester?

3254
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:25,560
Energy zero!

3255
02:54:28,060 --> 02:54:29,040
How much did we get?

3256
02:54:29,160 --> 02:54:29,680
$25.

3257
02:54:30,580 --> 02:54:32,020
To play video games?

3258
02:54:32,100 --> 02:54:32,720
I died.

3259
02:54:42,320 --> 02:54:42,840
Withdrawal?

3260
02:54:47,560 --> 02:54:49,260
I don't think...

3261
02:54:49,820 --> 02:54:51,220
Guys, I think I'm in trouble.

3262
02:54:57,440 --> 02:54:58,780
Guys, I think I'm in trouble.

3263
02:55:03,610 --> 02:55:04,890
No, we don't need more.

3264
02:55:05,110 --> 02:55:05,530
We're OK.

3265
02:55:06,890 --> 02:55:08,210
We'll fight through it.

3266
02:55:08,610 --> 02:55:09,110
I'm clean.

3267
02:55:09,210 --> 02:55:09,570
I'm clean.

3268
02:55:10,170 --> 02:55:10,970
I'm not clean.

3269
02:55:11,610 --> 02:55:13,710
We're happy and we're satisfied.

3270
02:55:14,390 --> 02:55:15,290
We're so good.

3271
02:55:15,550 --> 02:55:16,250
Everything's fine.

3272
02:55:16,250 --> 02:55:17,250
Everything's fine.

3273
02:55:18,370 --> 02:55:19,570
Everything's A-OK.

3274
02:55:20,190 --> 02:55:22,330
Don't worry about it.

3275
02:55:25,230 --> 02:55:29,410
I think I've explored pretty much everything that I want to in here.

3276
02:55:30,310 --> 02:55:31,770
Let's read our book.

3277
02:55:33,010 --> 02:55:35,590
To forget about our withdrawal symptoms.

3278
02:55:36,630 --> 02:55:38,150
Oh, we're not happy anymore.

3279
02:55:41,850 --> 02:55:43,370
Where is...

3280
02:55:46,550 --> 02:55:48,630
There was a market down here, no?

3281
02:55:51,770 --> 02:55:52,370
Yeah.

3282
02:55:53,090 --> 02:55:54,250
It is closed.

3283
02:55:55,350 --> 02:55:55,950
Just kidding.

3284
02:55:56,050 --> 02:55:56,550
Oh wait, about here.

3285
02:55:56,790 --> 02:55:57,290
There we go.

3286
02:55:58,170 --> 02:55:59,450
Beer o'clock, baby.

3287
02:56:00,650 --> 02:56:01,490
Fruit candy.

3288
02:56:05,490 --> 02:56:07,110
I like the steering wheel.

3289
02:56:12,340 --> 02:56:14,200
There's a lottery ticket too.

3290
02:56:16,540 --> 02:56:17,800
Oh, the jerry can.

3291
02:56:17,960 --> 02:56:20,380
Yes, that is definitely really good to have.

3292
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:22,480
For sure.

3293
02:56:22,980 --> 02:56:23,620
No beer.

3294
02:56:24,200 --> 02:56:24,600
No beer.

3295
02:56:24,880 --> 02:56:26,680
You guys were playing it safe, OK?

3296
02:56:27,080 --> 02:56:28,100
We're gonna get some nuts.

3297
02:56:28,980 --> 02:56:30,180
We're gonna forget about our troubles.

3298
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:35,520
Get some cot... Oh wait.

3299
02:56:36,680 --> 02:56:37,200
Nevermind.

3300
02:56:37,780 --> 02:56:38,340
We're good.

3301
02:56:42,580 --> 02:56:43,260
Jerry can.

3302
02:56:44,100 --> 02:56:46,280
Fruit candy to go with your nose candies.

3303
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:50,080
Stop it!

3304
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:52,240
Stop it!

3305
02:56:52,540 --> 02:56:53,820
If I drink...

3306
02:56:56,440 --> 02:57:00,140
If I drink the coffee, you think it will offset the...

3307
02:57:00,140 --> 02:57:02,740
How did I touch... You guys...

3308
02:57:02,740 --> 02:57:04,300
I didn't even reach for the cocaine.

3309
02:57:04,380 --> 02:57:05,140
How did that happen?

3310
02:57:05,540 --> 02:57:06,100
No, no.

3311
02:57:06,260 --> 02:57:07,620
I think I am an addict.

3312
02:57:07,620 --> 02:57:11,480
I reached for the coffee and then I blacked out.

3313
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:14,080
And then when I opened up my eyes again, it was cocaine!

3314
02:57:23,710 --> 02:57:25,690
Pull yourself together, Mito!

3315
02:57:27,650 --> 02:57:28,750
No, no, no.

3316
02:57:29,150 --> 02:57:29,630
There you go.

3317
02:57:30,230 --> 02:57:30,590
Coffee.

3318
02:57:31,410 --> 02:57:31,770
Coffee.

3319
02:57:31,950 --> 02:57:33,790
My hands are like shaking and I'm just like...

3320
02:57:33,790 --> 02:57:34,450
Coffee.

3321
02:57:35,030 --> 02:57:35,390
Coffee.

3322
02:57:35,590 --> 02:57:36,910
OK, it didn't get rid of my...

3323
02:57:36,910 --> 02:57:38,750
How do I get rid of the withdrawal symptoms?

3324
02:57:45,620 --> 02:57:46,500
Symptoms...

3325
02:57:53,180 --> 02:57:54,540
Just time, I think.

3326
02:57:55,540 --> 02:57:57,000
Do more drugs.

3327
02:57:57,720 --> 02:57:58,600
I'm clean!

3328
02:57:59,120 --> 02:58:00,200
I'm clean!

3329
02:58:00,720 --> 02:58:01,760
I'm clean!

3330
02:58:04,300 --> 02:58:05,180
Please!

3331
02:58:05,640 --> 02:58:06,840
I'm clean!

3332
02:58:07,160 --> 02:58:08,080
I'm clean!

3333
02:58:09,420 --> 02:58:11,080
Let's get out of this town.

3334
02:58:11,160 --> 02:58:12,060
It's a bad influence.

3335
02:58:23,080 --> 02:58:23,520
Soap!

3336
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:25,000
Oh, this is actually good to have.

3337
02:58:37,580 --> 02:58:39,700
The espresso machine is calling to me.

3338
02:58:41,900 --> 02:58:43,260
Soap next to the doujins.

3339
02:58:43,380 --> 02:58:43,560
Yeah.

3340
02:58:44,680 --> 02:58:46,100
You can wash your hands after you're done.

3341
02:58:46,580 --> 02:58:47,220
Breathe in them.

3342
02:58:49,360 --> 02:58:50,780
Oh, the instant ramen!

3343
02:58:50,900 --> 02:58:51,240
Remember!

3344
02:58:51,580 --> 02:58:52,680
We couldn't...

3345
02:58:52,680 --> 02:58:54,880
So, remember there was a...

3346
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:56,340
There was the pot.

3347
02:58:56,700 --> 02:58:58,040
The stove.

3348
02:58:58,180 --> 02:58:59,420
The portable stove.

3349
02:59:00,540 --> 02:59:03,140
I can't believe that the watermelon is one to one.

3350
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:07,560
I can't believe that that is...

3351
02:59:07,560 --> 02:59:10,500
That is just a single use.

3352
02:59:10,740 --> 02:59:12,460
You just eat the entire thing.

3353
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:13,700
It's craziness.

3354
02:59:14,720 --> 02:59:16,060
Alright, let's get out of here for real.

3355
02:59:24,860 --> 02:59:26,680
We gotta go make some more money.

3356
02:59:34,920 --> 02:59:37,500
F-ing trippy to be in the city.

3357
02:59:38,200 --> 02:59:41,380
Yeah, it's weird after being in the country for so long.

3358
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:43,620
It's awesome.

3359
02:59:44,320 --> 02:59:46,240
But it's gotta suck living here, man.

3360
02:59:47,680 --> 02:59:48,040
Really?

3361
02:59:48,480 --> 02:59:49,680
You think he would like it?

3362
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:55,620
We got a Zimmer Grandioso.

3363
02:59:59,300 --> 03:00:01,100
Perfect, we can listen to the whole CD.

3364
03:00:02,780 --> 03:00:04,800
Who doesn't eat it in one bite?

3365
03:00:20,780 --> 03:00:21,640
I'm clean.

3366
03:00:22,020 --> 03:00:23,240
I just have what...

3367
03:00:23,240 --> 03:00:24,960
He's not gonna see what's in my trunk, right?

3368
03:00:27,440 --> 03:00:29,480
Good thing I didn't get the gun, you guys.

3369
03:00:34,260 --> 03:00:34,760
Get

3370
03:00:53,510 --> 03:00:54,170
the gun.

3371
03:00:55,550 --> 03:00:56,870
Here's a random negative.

3372
03:00:59,410 --> 03:01:00,910
No more withdrawals!

3373
03:01:12,560 --> 03:01:13,960
Get me out of here.

3374
03:01:21,860 --> 03:01:23,540
See ya, coppers!

3375
03:01:27,430 --> 03:01:29,530
I'm gonna step on it for real.

3376
03:01:30,490 --> 03:01:30,890
Roadkill!

3377
03:01:32,090 --> 03:01:33,150
I lost some money, though.

3378
03:01:33,230 --> 03:01:33,870
It kinda sucks.

3379
03:01:35,250 --> 03:01:36,070
You have to choose, Minto.

3380
03:01:36,210 --> 03:01:38,210
Would you live in the city or live out in the countryside?

3381
03:01:39,130 --> 03:01:40,490
It depends on what city.

3382
03:01:41,070 --> 03:01:42,310
Like, I like Tokyo.

3383
03:01:43,610 --> 03:01:45,890
So I wouldn't mind living there, but...

3384
03:01:51,740 --> 03:01:54,160
I think generally I would wanna live in the countryside.

3385
03:01:56,820 --> 03:02:00,980
If I'm in, like, Tokyo, then I can go see idols, you know?

3386
03:02:01,720 --> 03:02:02,580
That's important.

3387
03:02:04,720 --> 03:02:08,680
But generally, I think I would... I'm a city... I'm a country gal.

3388
03:02:15,150 --> 03:02:17,230
Countryside but with good internet is the dream.

3389
03:02:17,450 --> 03:02:18,150
So true.

3390
03:02:19,290 --> 03:02:19,990
It's 4 AM.

3391
03:02:20,070 --> 03:02:20,730
What time... Wait.

3392
03:02:21,410 --> 03:02:22,890
When is the festival?

3393
03:02:22,890 --> 03:02:25,990
What day is it?

3394
03:02:30,260 --> 03:02:31,420
It doesn't say.

3395
03:02:33,260 --> 03:02:35,120
It's June 13th.

3396
03:02:39,200 --> 03:02:40,140
Oh, the calendar.

3397
03:02:40,360 --> 03:02:40,640
Thank you.

3398
03:02:43,900 --> 03:02:44,780
June 30th.

3399
03:02:44,820 --> 03:02:46,080
Oh my gosh, we have so much time!

3400
03:02:46,200 --> 03:02:47,480
Well, actually...

3401
03:02:47,480 --> 03:02:49,040
Might be kinda giddy-giddy.

3402
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:49,560
We'll see.

3403
03:02:52,100 --> 03:02:54,220
I think it's gonna be giddy-giddy here, too.

3404
03:02:54,220 --> 03:02:58,440
Wait, so Hongrad... Hongrad is...

3405
03:02:58,440 --> 03:02:59,660
The punk club, no?

3406
03:03:00,260 --> 03:03:01,680
Yeah, so we'll go there.

3407
03:03:02,420 --> 03:03:03,660
Then we'll go upwards.

3408
03:03:10,780 --> 03:03:11,700
Film extra.

3409
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:14,100
That's what we're heading to now.

3410
03:03:16,620 --> 03:03:17,700
I think we'll be okay.

3411
03:03:18,620 --> 03:03:19,880
I think we're gonna make it this time.

3412
03:03:19,960 --> 03:03:20,500
For real!

3413
03:03:24,140 --> 03:03:26,620
I can't get enough of these beautiful open roads.

3414
03:03:27,320 --> 03:03:29,780
I'm so happy that I can just drive around for a summer.

3415
03:03:30,240 --> 03:03:31,280
I never want to leave the road.

3416
03:03:31,320 --> 03:03:32,960
Yeah, I'm so happy I can just drive around!

3417
03:03:33,700 --> 03:03:37,080
Although it would be nice if someone else drove a bit, too, so I can look around more.

3418
03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:38,220
Fair.

3419
03:03:39,600 --> 03:03:40,320
I'm inspired.

3420
03:03:40,640 --> 03:03:41,680
What does inspired do?

3421
03:03:42,800 --> 03:03:45,060
Next energy cost is reduced to zero.

3422
03:03:48,640 --> 03:03:49,360
Countryside idols?

3423
03:03:51,780 --> 03:03:53,300
Not gonna lie, that's pretty good.

3424
03:03:54,940 --> 03:03:55,380
Who are you?

3425
03:03:57,600 --> 03:03:58,840
Hey, how are things?

3426
03:03:59,220 --> 03:03:59,780
It's been a while.

3427
03:04:00,360 --> 03:04:01,100
I don't know, dude.

3428
03:04:01,540 --> 03:04:03,120
I've been thinking about maybe settling down.

3429
03:04:03,560 --> 03:04:07,980
My grandpa bought some land out by the coast and maybe I should just, like, build a house there or something.

3430
03:04:08,340 --> 03:04:08,800
I don't know.

3431
03:04:11,240 --> 03:04:12,500
Stop wasting my time!

3432
03:04:17,790 --> 03:04:18,590
Three hours?

3433
03:04:18,650 --> 03:04:19,230
That's not so bad.

3434
03:04:24,290 --> 03:04:25,650
Countryside with vibrant internet.

3435
03:04:25,790 --> 03:04:27,090
My neighbors are cows and horses.

3436
03:04:27,090 --> 03:04:29,630
A tortoise tried to get into my house through the front door.

3437
03:04:29,850 --> 03:04:32,950
How fast was this tortoise?

3438
03:04:41,230 --> 03:04:42,830
No, we can't get gas here.

3439
03:04:42,970 --> 03:04:44,490
Oh, I do have a jerry can, though.

3440
03:04:45,490 --> 03:04:46,970
Damn the sun, it's too bright.

3441
03:04:58,240 --> 03:04:59,920
I like being on the road with you guys.

3442
03:05:02,340 --> 03:05:05,700
I think now that I have a new car, I would want to go on more road trips.

3443
03:05:06,300 --> 03:05:07,020
I'm lost!

3444
03:05:07,020 --> 03:05:07,080
Lost?

3445
03:05:07,180 --> 03:05:07,800
Uh-oh.

3446
03:05:18,650 --> 03:05:19,250
Nice.

3447
03:05:21,110 --> 03:05:21,710
Dog!

3448
03:05:22,110 --> 03:05:22,590
Sick him!

3449
03:05:26,810 --> 03:05:29,270
This isn't gonna be perfect, but that's okay.

3450
03:05:32,410 --> 03:05:33,890
Set all threat to attack.

3451
03:05:34,190 --> 03:05:35,850
A zombie!

3452
03:05:36,070 --> 03:05:36,350
A zombie!

3453
03:05:36,490 --> 03:05:36,810
A zombie!

3454
03:05:38,430 --> 03:05:40,130
My cyber truck.

3455
03:05:41,850 --> 03:05:42,330
Yeah.

3456
03:05:43,510 --> 03:05:46,030
Can a cyber truck even go on a road trip?

3457
03:05:46,510 --> 03:05:48,050
It feels kind of dangerous, though.

3458
03:05:48,630 --> 03:05:54,270
I've always wondered, how long does it take for an electric car like that to charge?

3459
03:05:55,150 --> 03:05:58,770
Like, are you just sitting in the parking lot for hours waiting for it to charge?

3460
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:04,780
Oh, rough terrain.

3461
03:06:04,940 --> 03:06:06,120
Oh my god, not the tumbleweeds.

3462
03:06:09,700 --> 03:06:11,660
20 to 30 minutes, usually.

3463
03:06:12,100 --> 03:06:14,540
Okay, 30 minutes if it's a good one.

3464
03:06:14,840 --> 03:06:18,860
Okay, that could've... I was expecting so much worse.

3465
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:21,800
I was like, this sucks.

3466
03:06:26,780 --> 03:06:28,240
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

3467
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:29,500
Oh, not nice.

3468
03:06:29,920 --> 03:06:32,460
I was hoping that it would get rid of it.

3469
03:06:33,060 --> 03:06:34,300
So then we could use him.

3470
03:06:34,900 --> 03:06:35,720
Oh, our gas!

3471
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:41,440
Oh, I think we got saved by the armor.

3472
03:06:41,640 --> 03:06:42,640
We got saved by the armor.

3473
03:06:46,420 --> 03:06:47,900
We're okay, we're okay, we're okay.

3474
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:49,800
Our armor saved us.

3475
03:06:53,080 --> 03:06:56,720
I haven't had to... Since we have two armor, I haven't had to, like...

3476
03:06:57,900 --> 03:07:01,560
I haven't had to, like, use the extra armor thing, so maybe I'll switch that out.

3477
03:07:04,540 --> 03:07:04,980
Turtle!

3478
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:13,020
If there's a turtle in the middle of the road and you need to get him out of the way...

3479
03:07:13,020 --> 03:07:14,140
Why is he such a threat?

3480
03:07:15,960 --> 03:07:22,340
What you should do is you should move him onto the side of the road that he's trying to walk towards, you know?

3481
03:07:22,700 --> 03:07:27,420
Because otherwise, the little guy is just going to walk right back into the road.

3482
03:07:32,780 --> 03:07:34,600
So always keep that in mind.

3483
03:07:40,140 --> 03:07:42,080
I've moved many a turtle in my day.

3484
03:07:43,660 --> 03:07:45,180
But you're not helping the turtle.

3485
03:07:45,920 --> 03:07:47,320
Oh, why am I in the game?

3486
03:07:47,440 --> 03:07:48,340
Because I suck.

3487
03:07:54,010 --> 03:07:57,910
I'm a stinky person in this game, I guess.

3488
03:08:03,440 --> 03:08:05,780
Oh, it's a... Sorry, it's a Blade Runner joke?

3489
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:06,900
Is it?

3490
03:08:07,080 --> 03:08:08,320
I don't remember it at all.

3491
03:08:10,200 --> 03:08:11,140
Let's get our money.

3492
03:08:12,440 --> 03:08:13,980
It's just the kind of car we need.

3493
03:08:17,060 --> 03:08:17,500
Nice.

3494
03:08:17,500 --> 03:08:18,840
Nice, nice, nice.

3495
03:08:20,500 --> 03:08:21,840
This movie will be so amazing.

3496
03:08:22,640 --> 03:08:23,320
I believe you.

3497
03:08:26,620 --> 03:08:27,580
This guy again?

3498
03:08:29,840 --> 03:08:30,500
What's up?

3499
03:08:31,700 --> 03:08:33,320
Always happy to see my fellow road tripper.

3500
03:08:34,300 --> 03:08:36,760
I hope you never end up on the straight and narrow.

3501
03:08:37,320 --> 03:08:40,940
I mean sure, you'll have money and clean clothes, but like...

3502
03:08:40,940 --> 03:08:43,160
Fuck man, we need people like you.

3503
03:08:45,180 --> 03:08:45,880
Like me?

3504
03:08:47,180 --> 03:08:47,640
Freaks?

3505
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:49,620
We need more freaks on the road.

3506
03:08:51,020 --> 03:08:52,020
Are we there yet?

3507
03:08:52,140 --> 03:08:52,660
Are we there yet?

3508
03:08:52,740 --> 03:08:53,260
Are we there yet?

3509
03:08:53,260 --> 03:08:54,040
Bald!

3510
03:08:56,540 --> 03:08:59,100
I wonder what I would look like bald with this hat on.

3511
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:19,760
I think I have enough food.

3512
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:21,240
I don't have anything to sell.

3513
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:22,840
We haven't really gone exploring or anything.

3514
03:09:25,500 --> 03:09:26,380
I think we're good.

3515
03:09:26,600 --> 03:09:28,480
Let's get some gas and hit the road.

3516
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:37,280
Oh, I almost had it at 25 exactly.

3517
03:09:38,620 --> 03:09:39,800
I was taking a drink.

3518
03:09:42,700 --> 03:09:43,580
Yeah, and...

3519
03:09:43,580 --> 03:09:43,980
Puncture!

3520
03:10:03,310 --> 03:10:04,350
Yes, at last!

3521
03:10:04,670 --> 03:10:06,350
I got the fan set perfectly.

3522
03:10:06,870 --> 03:10:14,890
Good strength, not too loud, and in all the right directions.

3523
03:10:15,970 --> 03:10:17,530
Maybe I should just... No, no, no, leave it.

3524
03:10:17,810 --> 03:10:18,330
It's perfect.

3525
03:10:19,170 --> 03:10:22,510
You put your hand to the fan and then hold over the controls, but refrain.

3526
03:10:26,050 --> 03:10:27,710
Oh, we're tired and hungry.

3527
03:10:27,910 --> 03:10:28,490
I just noticed.

3528
03:10:29,350 --> 03:10:30,110
We'll eat, we'll eat.

3529
03:10:34,960 --> 03:10:36,780
I like this music a lot.

3530
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:42,300
Do not play with those settings.

3531
03:10:42,680 --> 03:10:43,200
I know!

3532
03:10:43,440 --> 03:10:44,540
You just said it was...

3533
03:10:44,540 --> 03:10:45,380
The ocean!

3534
03:10:50,840 --> 03:10:54,320
Aw man, we're getting bullied by... Do a kickflip!

3535
03:10:56,820 --> 03:10:59,900
Hey kids, it's me, Tony Hawk.

3536
03:11:01,600 --> 03:11:03,280
Why are they all a threat?

3537
03:11:03,440 --> 03:11:04,380
What is happening here?

3538
03:11:08,820 --> 03:11:09,760
See ya, kids.

3539
03:11:10,180 --> 03:11:11,320
On the highway, right?

3540
03:11:13,020 --> 03:11:14,440
It's so pretty!

3541
03:11:18,460 --> 03:11:21,320
This is making me wanna road trip so bad.

3542
03:11:23,320 --> 03:11:25,660
I wanna go on a road trip.

3543
03:11:26,500 --> 03:11:27,500
Dumpster diving.

3544
03:11:28,420 --> 03:11:29,620
Wait, we're going fishing?

3545
03:11:30,140 --> 03:11:30,740
Let's go.

3546
03:11:32,760 --> 03:11:35,220
This has been such a comfy stream to listen to while I work.

3547
03:11:35,300 --> 03:11:35,860
Thank you, Minto.

3548
03:11:36,560 --> 03:11:37,300
Of course!

3549
03:11:38,120 --> 03:11:38,940
Thank you.

3550
03:11:39,760 --> 03:11:42,420
Oh, we don't have what's-her-name anymore.

3551
03:11:44,900 --> 03:11:45,380
I

3552
03:11:52,600 --> 03:11:54,700
don't mind the energy threads so much.

3553
03:11:59,270 --> 03:12:01,010
I don't mind those ones so much.

3554
03:12:01,790 --> 03:12:02,290
So, bye!

3555
03:12:03,490 --> 03:12:05,310
Oh, I don't wanna... It's fine.

3556
03:12:09,950 --> 03:12:11,310
We're just gonna have to use it.

3557
03:12:11,490 --> 03:12:12,250
Wait, what's this one?

3558
03:12:12,930 --> 03:12:13,370
Hungry.

3559
03:12:13,510 --> 03:12:14,050
Oh, we're hungry.

3560
03:12:15,550 --> 03:12:16,490
What are we getting?

3561
03:12:17,990 --> 03:12:18,790
A Danish!

3562
03:12:20,090 --> 03:12:20,830
Oh my god.

3563
03:12:24,700 --> 03:12:25,220
Please.

3564
03:12:28,120 --> 03:12:28,640
Please.

3565
03:12:29,200 --> 03:12:30,840
Why is there so much?

3566
03:12:31,180 --> 03:12:34,600
Who's just throwing away all this cocaine?

3567
03:12:36,400 --> 03:12:38,220
I know I don't have to take it.

3568
03:12:38,220 --> 03:12:42,660
I'm saving it up, you guys, so that we can throw it in the mega dumpster.

3569
03:12:42,780 --> 03:12:43,100
No!

3570
03:12:43,580 --> 03:12:45,120
I'll drop it into the sea.

3571
03:12:46,100 --> 03:12:47,500
I'll let the fishies handle it.

3572
03:12:50,780 --> 03:12:52,520
Why is there...

3573
03:12:52,520 --> 03:12:54,640
Why is there so much?

3574
03:12:55,300 --> 03:12:56,740
Behind large truck.

3575
03:12:56,840 --> 03:12:58,240
Uh-oh, we're gonna get stressed again.

3576
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:04,060
Mega dumpster of your nose.

3577
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:05,220
No!

3578
03:13:07,140 --> 03:13:08,980
That'd be ridiculous.

3579
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:20,220
Oh, this is perfect.

3580
03:13:20,360 --> 03:13:20,840
Oh my gosh.

3581
03:13:21,420 --> 03:13:22,860
I love when things work out like that.

3582
03:13:23,560 --> 03:13:23,880
Ouch.

3583
03:13:25,460 --> 03:13:27,240
The festival's gonna be so lit.

3584
03:13:27,560 --> 03:13:31,400
We're bringing it for all our friends, you know?

3585
03:13:35,620 --> 03:13:37,080
All of our friends.

3586
03:13:37,740 --> 03:13:39,620
Gonna have a crazy time.

3587
03:13:40,040 --> 03:13:42,180
Oh shoot, I just noticed I had the spray bottle.

3588
03:13:43,940 --> 03:13:44,740
My bad.

3589
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:46,340
Oh, where were you?

3590
03:13:49,060 --> 03:13:49,580
Dog.

3591
03:13:50,040 --> 03:13:50,520
Pet.

3592
03:13:54,550 --> 03:13:56,730
That would be ridiculous because your nose is tiny.

3593
03:13:59,050 --> 03:14:00,870
Does it make your nose grow?

3594
03:14:04,550 --> 03:14:06,930
Take all the coke at once for a secret ending.

3595
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:20,760
It makes it bleed?

3596
03:14:24,020 --> 03:14:25,140
Oh my god.

3597
03:14:29,370 --> 03:14:31,870
Wait, shouldn't it have gotten rid of...

3598
03:14:35,610 --> 03:14:37,610
Oh my god, there's a bee in our car!

3599
03:14:39,710 --> 03:14:42,290
Oh my god, we have a bee in our car!

3600
03:14:46,470 --> 03:14:49,110
It's okay, as soon as we get to the next place we're gonna rest.

3601
03:14:51,770 --> 03:14:53,990
I just noticed what the threat was.

3602
03:14:54,290 --> 03:14:56,350
I thought it was... I don't know what I thought it was.

3603
03:14:57,910 --> 03:14:59,630
I thought... Hello, please.

3604
03:15:08,040 --> 03:15:08,480
Bitch!

3605
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:14,460
Wanderlust.

3606
03:15:20,830 --> 03:15:22,130
Okay, we're here.

3607
03:15:22,930 --> 03:15:24,290
Go to the punk club.

3608
03:15:26,450 --> 03:15:28,170
We'll sleep here too.

3609
03:15:29,510 --> 03:15:30,810
Café cookie!

3610
03:15:32,570 --> 03:15:34,010
Oh, shop.

3611
03:15:35,930 --> 03:15:37,150
More jar of eggs.

3612
03:15:38,410 --> 03:15:39,370
Yeah, I'll take it.

3613
03:15:42,940 --> 03:15:45,060
I'll take the jar of eggs.

3614
03:15:46,780 --> 03:15:47,560
Yeah, I'll take that.

3615
03:15:50,980 --> 03:15:52,600
Where's the punk club?

3616
03:15:54,040 --> 03:15:54,760
Hotel?

3617
03:15:56,120 --> 03:15:56,960
Who are you?

3618
03:15:58,440 --> 03:16:00,560
Hey buddy, can you spare some change?

3619
03:16:01,400 --> 03:16:02,500
Yeah, I'll give you a dollar.

3620
03:16:03,300 --> 03:16:04,100
Appreciate it.

3621
03:16:04,860 --> 03:16:05,440
You're welcome.

3622
03:16:05,760 --> 03:16:07,640
I'm accumulating good karma.

3623
03:16:08,780 --> 03:16:09,740
Half food?

3624
03:16:10,820 --> 03:16:11,960
As opposed to what?

3625
03:16:14,620 --> 03:16:16,800
Boil a mashup, stick them in a stew!

3626
03:16:17,560 --> 03:16:18,780
What year is it?

3627
03:16:20,600 --> 03:16:22,020
You might want to grab some coffee.

3628
03:16:22,080 --> 03:16:23,080
We're gonna go to sleep I think.

3629
03:16:24,480 --> 03:16:26,420
I'm so psyched for the festival.

3630
03:16:27,020 --> 03:16:29,180
Oh, this is the guy that gives us the CD.

3631
03:16:31,800 --> 03:16:33,440
Our car is okay.

3632
03:16:34,120 --> 03:16:35,780
Wait, I do though customize.

3633
03:16:36,720 --> 03:16:38,300
Let's try a different paint, no?

3634
03:16:42,220 --> 03:16:43,480
Wait, what about the teal?

3635
03:16:44,860 --> 03:16:47,360
That's a mint-o-mobile if I've ever seen one before.

3636
03:16:50,480 --> 03:16:51,260
Grocery corner.

3637
03:16:52,320 --> 03:16:53,560
Beep boop.

3638
03:16:55,820 --> 03:16:56,840
Nothing of interest.

3639
03:16:58,600 --> 03:17:00,360
Please wash your car.

3640
03:17:00,900 --> 03:17:02,160
How do I wash it?

3641
03:17:03,100 --> 03:17:04,780
How do I wash the car?

3642
03:17:05,080 --> 03:17:05,260
Here?

3643
03:17:07,100 --> 03:17:08,100
At the repair?

3644
03:17:12,180 --> 03:17:13,320
Coffee break.

3645
03:17:15,340 --> 03:17:18,080
If I budget repair, will I still clean it?

3646
03:17:25,790 --> 03:17:27,330
My friend is a big fan of yours.

3647
03:17:27,410 --> 03:17:29,390
Could you sing him happy birthday when you get the chance?

3648
03:17:30,170 --> 03:17:30,850
I would love to!

3649
03:17:32,730 --> 03:17:33,970
Thank you for the superchat!

3650
03:17:34,910 --> 03:17:36,890
What's your friend's name?

3651
03:17:47,980 --> 03:17:48,940
Oh it's clean!

3652
03:17:50,240 --> 03:17:51,440
Yay!

3653
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:58,480
So, I'm looking for this place called VCE.

3654
03:18:00,020 --> 03:18:01,660
Digital Equipment.

3655
03:18:01,920 --> 03:18:03,060
That's your friend's name?

3656
03:18:05,440 --> 03:18:09,480
Happy birthday to you!

3657
03:18:10,060 --> 03:18:12,680
Happy birthday to you!

3658
03:18:13,260 --> 03:18:16,100
Happy birthday digital equipment!

3659
03:18:19,740 --> 03:18:22,520
Happy birthday to you!

3660
03:18:23,800 --> 03:18:28,940
And if that's not your name you can blame your friend Tei for this.

3661
03:18:30,380 --> 03:18:31,160
Happy birthday!

3662
03:18:33,500 --> 03:18:35,180
I'm looking for this club called VCE.

3663
03:18:35,660 --> 03:18:36,720
It's somewhere around here.

3664
03:18:37,020 --> 03:18:37,800
Want to help me find it?

3665
03:18:38,080 --> 03:18:39,880
Oh, and can you take care of my dog?

3666
03:18:40,580 --> 03:18:42,880
I don't think she'll like... Oh, that's the guy.

3667
03:18:42,980 --> 03:18:44,300
I was wondering who we were talking to.

3668
03:18:47,530 --> 03:18:48,890
Did I find it?

3669
03:18:48,990 --> 03:18:51,230
Or why did I zoom away so fast?

3670
03:18:52,290 --> 03:18:52,750
I'm talking?

3671
03:18:54,090 --> 03:18:54,430
Grandma.

3672
03:18:55,430 --> 03:18:59,530
Back in the 60's me and my hubby got ourselves a beautiful car.

3673
03:19:00,010 --> 03:19:02,870
We did everything we could to keep it up to spec.

3674
03:19:03,430 --> 03:19:04,370
Not a dent.

3675
03:19:04,770 --> 03:19:06,150
Not a scratch.

3676
03:19:06,510 --> 03:19:09,270
We might as well have wrapped it in armor.

3677
03:19:10,550 --> 03:19:12,010
Gotta explore to find it.

3678
03:19:12,010 --> 03:19:12,310
OK.

3679
03:19:16,890 --> 03:19:19,410
There was an explore area actually though.

3680
03:19:23,570 --> 03:19:24,890
Enter the hotel.

3681
03:19:25,110 --> 03:19:27,390
We're gonna also do a job so we can make some more money.

3682
03:19:33,960 --> 03:19:35,160
So scary.

3683
03:19:41,600 --> 03:19:43,640
I don't like the streets.

3684
03:19:45,360 --> 03:19:47,540
I wasn't built for the streets!

3685
03:19:54,390 --> 03:19:56,670
Clear obstacles while exploring the city.

3686
03:19:57,170 --> 03:19:58,190
I'm a city kid.

3687
03:20:00,810 --> 03:20:02,130
There's nothing even here.

3688
03:20:07,850 --> 03:20:11,010
How much you wanna bet there's cocaine in that car?

3689
03:20:11,550 --> 03:20:13,370
You would think that cocaine grows on trees.

3690
03:20:14,530 --> 03:20:15,090
Actually...

3691
03:20:15,090 --> 03:20:16,310
Where does it come from?

3692
03:20:17,550 --> 03:20:18,950
Does it grow on trees?

3693
03:20:18,950 --> 03:20:19,330
Trees.

3694
03:20:35,990 --> 03:20:37,010
I saw the club.

3695
03:20:37,090 --> 03:20:37,510
Don't worry.

3696
03:20:38,150 --> 03:20:40,070
I'm just checking the other stuff first too.

3697
03:20:49,140 --> 03:20:52,000
The punk enters the club, leaving the dog with you.

3698
03:20:53,640 --> 03:20:56,020
I'm not cool enough for the club I guess.

3699
03:20:56,340 --> 03:20:56,820
Fine.

3700
03:20:57,240 --> 03:20:59,660
I'll take all my cocaine home with me.

3701
03:20:59,660 --> 03:21:01,260
Nobody will have it.

3702
03:21:01,480 --> 03:21:02,700
I'm not willing to share.

3703
03:21:06,120 --> 03:21:09,100
It's a processed leaf from a certain plant.

3704
03:21:11,640 --> 03:21:13,140
We got more pizza!

3705
03:21:14,440 --> 03:21:15,440
And a new suspension.

3706
03:21:16,600 --> 03:21:17,480
I told you so.

3707
03:21:19,100 --> 03:21:19,640
Discard.

3708
03:21:19,760 --> 03:21:20,720
Yeah, let's get rid of that.

3709
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:23,480
I don't want a red car.

3710
03:21:31,970 --> 03:21:33,010
Sell the scrap.

3711
03:21:34,450 --> 03:21:35,630
Sell the suspension.

3712
03:21:36,190 --> 03:21:36,570
Nice.

3713
03:21:39,030 --> 03:21:40,970
So, is our guy gone?

3714
03:21:41,130 --> 03:21:43,490
Oh my gosh, I keep forgetting about our skill tree.

3715
03:21:44,970 --> 03:21:45,690
Let's see.

3716
03:21:47,210 --> 03:21:49,290
Remove one threat for each skill you use this event.

3717
03:21:51,490 --> 03:21:57,610
If you get it perfect with this skill, restore one use to all skills and gain 10...

3718
03:21:57,610 --> 03:21:58,270
10!

3719
03:22:09,060 --> 03:22:10,260
Did we just steal the dog?

3720
03:22:10,320 --> 03:22:11,780
We might have.

3721
03:22:12,160 --> 03:22:13,720
But I don't want to lose the guy.

3722
03:22:13,900 --> 03:22:15,380
He's been good to us.

3723
03:22:18,180 --> 03:22:20,180
Minto is for the maid cafe, not the streets.

3724
03:22:20,880 --> 03:22:23,140
Please drive me over in a coke-fueled rampage.

3725
03:22:30,570 --> 03:22:33,450
Become happy whenever you use a hitchhiker's skill this event.

3726
03:22:33,610 --> 03:22:34,690
Restore one energy.

3727
03:22:37,090 --> 03:22:37,970
Road trip!

3728
03:22:39,030 --> 03:22:42,850
Getting perfect with this gives you the social status.

3729
03:22:52,340 --> 03:22:53,780
If you're social, this costs nothing.

3730
03:22:54,100 --> 03:22:54,100
Wow.

3731
03:22:56,860 --> 03:22:59,520
Unlocking all skills in a tree gives bonus perk.

3732
03:23:00,320 --> 03:23:00,880
Well, I have.

3733
03:23:01,340 --> 03:23:01,800
Let's see.

3734
03:23:02,280 --> 03:23:03,820
What one would be easiest to unlock?

3735
03:23:04,100 --> 03:23:04,800
I guess this one.

3736
03:23:05,320 --> 03:23:06,220
I have a bunch of money.

3737
03:23:07,960 --> 03:23:09,020
It's the basic.

3738
03:23:11,140 --> 03:23:12,840
Working class hero.

3739
03:23:13,160 --> 03:23:16,740
When you use a basic skill, you have a 50% chance to become inspired.

3740
03:23:18,980 --> 03:23:20,460
Remove one threat for each...

3741
03:23:25,560 --> 03:23:26,980
Remove all armor.

3742
03:23:27,180 --> 03:23:28,240
I don't like that though.

3743
03:23:29,720 --> 03:23:30,760
Ignores shields.

3744
03:23:34,300 --> 03:23:35,320
Zero energy.

3745
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:38,580
Gain one armor for each threat removed with this.

3746
03:23:38,840 --> 03:23:40,120
This is so specific.

3747
03:23:40,280 --> 03:23:40,900
Holy moly.

3748
03:23:45,100 --> 03:23:45,480
Huh.

3749
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:49,360
Do you do menbucha happy birthdays?

3750
03:23:49,480 --> 03:23:49,860
I do!

3751
03:23:50,440 --> 03:23:51,040
Is it your birthday?

3752
03:23:55,300 --> 03:23:55,680
Serante.

3753
03:23:56,040 --> 03:23:56,780
Is that how you say your name?

3754
03:23:59,060 --> 03:23:59,960
Is it your birthday?

3755
03:24:02,080 --> 03:24:03,880
Love scout is good even when not perfect.

3756
03:24:03,960 --> 03:24:04,860
It gives armor per hit.

3757
03:24:04,980 --> 03:24:05,240
Really?

3758
03:24:05,460 --> 03:24:06,360
Okay, we'll add it then.

3759
03:24:09,360 --> 03:24:10,000
It is?

3760
03:24:10,120 --> 03:24:10,880
Okay, give me one second.

3761
03:24:11,580 --> 03:24:13,600
I'm gonna switch this one out actually.

3762
03:24:15,400 --> 03:24:18,380
Happy birthday to you.

3763
03:24:18,900 --> 03:24:21,240
Happy birthday to you.

3764
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:24,200
Happy birthday dear Serante.

3765
03:24:25,560 --> 03:24:28,820
Happy birthday to you.

3766
03:24:29,660 --> 03:24:30,360
Happy birthday!

3767
03:24:31,860 --> 03:24:33,520
And wow, welcome to membership.

3768
03:24:34,060 --> 03:24:34,920
Thank you so much.

3769
03:24:35,360 --> 03:24:36,180
Thank you, thank you.

3770
03:24:37,220 --> 03:24:37,800
Alrighty.

3771
03:24:38,960 --> 03:24:40,760
We are tired.

3772
03:24:43,220 --> 03:24:44,280
Trying to decide.

3773
03:24:44,540 --> 03:24:47,800
I mean obviously we need... What I'm gonna do...

3774
03:24:49,220 --> 03:24:51,800
What is illegal drugs?

3775
03:24:51,940 --> 03:24:52,640
No, I'm just kidding.

3776
03:24:54,040 --> 03:24:55,800
What I'm gonna do...

3777
03:24:57,640 --> 03:24:58,580
Two energy.

3778
03:25:00,580 --> 03:25:02,820
Let's go sell some stuff real quick.

3779
03:25:08,060 --> 03:25:08,620
Sell.

3780
03:25:08,620 --> 03:25:09,180
Sell.

3781
03:25:09,900 --> 03:25:12,540
Do we have any more energy things in here?

3782
03:25:13,640 --> 03:25:14,680
Any coffee?

3783
03:25:15,680 --> 03:25:15,960
No?

3784
03:25:16,140 --> 03:25:16,420
Seriously?

3785
03:25:16,580 --> 03:25:17,180
No coffee?

3786
03:25:19,900 --> 03:25:21,000
Someone clip that.

3787
03:25:21,100 --> 03:25:21,380
No!

3788
03:25:21,700 --> 03:25:22,700
I'm gonna get arrested.

3789
03:25:22,840 --> 03:25:24,100
I'm gonna go to hell.

3790
03:25:24,660 --> 03:25:25,540
No, please.

3791
03:25:25,660 --> 03:25:26,640
I'm a good girl.

3792
03:25:26,800 --> 03:25:27,340
I promise.

3793
03:25:28,060 --> 03:25:28,800
I promise.

3794
03:25:29,120 --> 03:25:30,240
I'm not doing drugs.

3795
03:25:30,560 --> 03:25:31,700
I'm not doing drugs.

3796
03:25:31,700 --> 03:25:33,040
I've never done drugs.

3797
03:25:33,280 --> 03:25:34,540
I'm a good girl.

3798
03:25:34,700 --> 03:25:35,700
I'm clean.

3799
03:25:39,520 --> 03:25:41,180
Then we go into... Holy!

3800
03:25:41,480 --> 03:25:42,240
An antique store.

3801
03:25:43,140 --> 03:25:44,300
Tent roof rack.

3802
03:25:44,420 --> 03:25:46,640
Fully restore energy when resting in the car.

3803
03:25:47,720 --> 03:25:48,860
That's awesome.

3804
03:25:50,980 --> 03:25:51,820
Pedal board.

3805
03:25:51,960 --> 03:25:54,240
Several effect pedals rigged to a board.

3806
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:55,680
No.

3807
03:25:55,840 --> 03:25:56,660
No more foie.

3808
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:58,140
No more foie.

3809
03:25:58,500 --> 03:26:00,080
I know what you are.

3810
03:26:00,560 --> 03:26:01,740
I know what you are.

3811
03:26:03,060 --> 03:26:05,580
You're a furry ass... Wiper?

3812
03:26:05,740 --> 03:26:06,260
What was it?

3813
03:26:09,660 --> 03:26:10,340
Furry...

3814
03:26:10,340 --> 03:26:11,420
Foie.

3815
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:13,680
Furry...

3816
03:26:15,620 --> 03:26:17,100
What was it?

3817
03:26:18,120 --> 03:26:20,920
Freaking world of ass.

3818
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:31,120
I was like... I was like furry.

3819
03:26:34,200 --> 03:26:36,400
I forgot about the werewolf.

3820
03:26:36,580 --> 03:26:40,960
Instead of werewolf, I just changed it out with furry.

3821
03:26:48,290 --> 03:26:49,710
Foie, foie time.

3822
03:26:49,970 --> 03:26:51,190
Foie, foie time.

3823
03:26:52,350 --> 03:26:53,970
What does the girl do anyway?

3824
03:26:54,730 --> 03:26:55,650
Our hula lady.

3825
03:26:58,590 --> 03:26:59,570
Portable stove.

3826
03:27:00,590 --> 03:27:01,950
Tent roof rack.

3827
03:27:03,530 --> 03:27:07,030
But we have to... We would lose the storage up here.

3828
03:27:07,550 --> 03:27:09,650
Which is... That's where we keep...

3829
03:27:11,230 --> 03:27:12,170
Some stuff.

3830
03:27:13,830 --> 03:27:15,950
In fact, that's where we'll be keeping all of our cocaine.

3831
03:27:37,910 --> 03:27:39,910
Don't mind... Don't mind this one.

3832
03:27:40,010 --> 03:27:40,990
I found it that way.

3833
03:27:41,150 --> 03:27:42,250
I didn't use it, okay?

3834
03:27:43,290 --> 03:27:44,750
So much cocaine.

3835
03:27:44,970 --> 03:27:46,730
I know, I just keep finding it.

3836
03:27:50,590 --> 03:27:52,690
Can I move the fog up front?

3837
03:27:53,270 --> 03:27:53,590
Fog?

3838
03:27:53,930 --> 03:27:54,810
Oh, the dog?

3839
03:27:56,610 --> 03:27:58,310
Can I move the dog up front?

3840
03:27:58,410 --> 03:27:59,070
Great question.

3841
03:28:00,850 --> 03:28:02,630
Wait, but I use the punk.

3842
03:28:03,410 --> 03:28:04,690
I use him a lot.

3843
03:28:05,790 --> 03:28:07,370
I'm kind of nervous now.

3844
03:28:07,490 --> 03:28:09,030
I use his skills a lot.

3845
03:28:10,550 --> 03:28:11,110
But...

3846
03:28:11,890 --> 03:28:13,210
It's not stackable?

3847
03:28:13,330 --> 03:28:14,230
I don't think so.

3848
03:28:15,010 --> 03:28:15,290
Nope.

3849
03:28:23,390 --> 03:28:24,930
It's not that I just noticed.

3850
03:28:25,190 --> 03:28:26,110
I noticed before.

3851
03:28:26,350 --> 03:28:28,710
I'm just lamenting about it again.

3852
03:28:29,550 --> 03:28:30,230
I'm nervous.

3853
03:28:33,610 --> 03:28:34,950
Find another person.

3854
03:28:35,830 --> 03:28:37,090
What's the dog doing?

3855
03:28:37,870 --> 03:28:39,630
He's chilling with us, I guess.

3856
03:28:40,710 --> 03:28:42,410
Was there anything in here?

3857
03:28:42,510 --> 03:28:42,810
Oh yeah.

3858
03:28:43,090 --> 03:28:43,870
Pizza delivery?

3859
03:28:47,870 --> 03:28:49,670
Time... Where is that?

3860
03:28:50,870 --> 03:28:52,370
Oh, it's not really.

3861
03:28:52,510 --> 03:28:54,030
It's kind of out of the way, huh?

3862
03:28:55,810 --> 03:28:56,770
We're here.

3863
03:28:58,510 --> 03:28:59,770
I'm going this way.

3864
03:29:00,570 --> 03:29:01,370
Oh my gosh, sorry.

3865
03:29:01,550 --> 03:29:04,790
I cannot... My mouse is really messing up.

3866
03:29:08,820 --> 03:29:09,960
And then this.

3867
03:29:13,200 --> 03:29:14,180
That one's easy.

3868
03:29:18,360 --> 03:29:20,240
Oh wait, is it already... No.

3869
03:29:22,780 --> 03:29:24,520
Hold on, I'm trying to find the...

3870
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:27,420
Mechanic.

3871
03:29:29,060 --> 03:29:30,220
Is it already on there?

3872
03:29:30,280 --> 03:29:31,780
I can't see it over the graffiti.

3873
03:29:32,120 --> 03:29:33,260
Am I still gonna get paid?

3874
03:29:35,960 --> 03:29:37,820
As long as I'm still paid, it's fine.

3875
03:29:37,880 --> 03:29:38,060
No?

3876
03:29:39,060 --> 03:29:40,400
Actually, I really hate this one.

3877
03:29:40,920 --> 03:29:41,740
I'm gonna sell it.

3878
03:29:41,920 --> 03:29:42,180
Goodbye.

3879
03:29:43,460 --> 03:29:45,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3880
03:29:46,100 --> 03:29:47,080
That's me!

3881
03:29:48,960 --> 03:29:50,240
That's me, baby.

3882
03:29:51,520 --> 03:29:52,980
Alright, let's do a job.

3883
03:29:54,580 --> 03:29:55,060
Job.

3884
03:29:55,420 --> 03:29:55,800
Job.

3885
03:29:56,820 --> 03:29:57,420
Job.

3886
03:29:58,500 --> 03:29:58,860
Wait.

3887
03:29:59,060 --> 03:29:59,640
Oh, wait.

3888
03:29:59,760 --> 03:30:01,020
Actually, was that chocolate?

3889
03:30:01,300 --> 03:30:01,900
Yes!

3890
03:30:02,440 --> 03:30:02,940
Chocolate?

3891
03:30:03,380 --> 03:30:05,060
Did you just say chocolate?

3892
03:30:07,290 --> 03:30:07,640
Chocolate!

3893
03:30:07,640 --> 03:30:08,340
Chocolate.

3894
03:30:11,220 --> 03:30:11,780
Job.

3895
03:30:12,080 --> 03:30:12,500
Job.

3896
03:30:12,640 --> 03:30:12,880
Job.

3897
03:30:12,920 --> 03:30:13,260
Job.

3898
03:30:13,280 --> 03:30:13,700
Job.

3899
03:30:13,800 --> 03:30:14,740
Gosh, we're so fast.

3900
03:30:15,440 --> 03:30:16,700
My eyes can't keep up.

3901
03:30:17,240 --> 03:30:18,520
Alright, we can be a toilet cleaner.

3902
03:30:19,340 --> 03:30:20,640
We could be...

3903
03:30:21,260 --> 03:30:24,260
A toilet cleaner for 14 hours.

3904
03:30:24,720 --> 03:30:26,120
Okay, we only have 4 energy.

3905
03:30:26,300 --> 03:30:27,080
10 energy.

3906
03:30:28,360 --> 03:30:28,980
2 energy.

3907
03:30:29,540 --> 03:30:30,600
I get 30 dollars.

3908
03:30:31,060 --> 03:30:31,660
5 energy.

3909
03:30:31,880 --> 03:30:32,000
No.

3910
03:30:33,140 --> 03:30:33,660
Bartender.

3911
03:30:37,360 --> 03:30:38,620
Give it to the dog.

3912
03:30:38,700 --> 03:30:38,940
No!

3913
03:30:44,650 --> 03:30:45,910
Why am I drunk?

3914
03:30:48,690 --> 03:30:49,650
How did this happen?

3915
03:30:50,430 --> 03:30:52,410
At least I'm in the city drunk.

3916
03:30:55,690 --> 03:30:57,930
Do bartenders get drunk on the job?

3917
03:31:02,810 --> 03:31:04,010
Is that common?

3918
03:31:08,530 --> 03:31:09,670
Some do.

3919
03:31:11,450 --> 03:31:13,350
They're not supposed to.

3920
03:31:13,570 --> 03:31:14,810
The good ones do.

3921
03:31:16,890 --> 03:31:18,190
We got a headache.

3922
03:31:18,750 --> 03:31:19,290
Oopsie.

3923
03:31:22,030 --> 03:31:23,490
Oh, we can cure this.

3924
03:31:27,750 --> 03:31:28,290
Nice.

3925
03:31:31,350 --> 03:31:33,150
At least I'm in the city drunk, she says.

3926
03:31:33,610 --> 03:31:35,650
I'm in masses of pedestrians.

3927
03:31:37,510 --> 03:31:40,590
Well, if they knew any better, they'd stay out of the road.

3928
03:31:40,590 --> 03:31:42,490
Now this is driving.

3929
03:31:43,430 --> 03:31:45,130
Alright, let's keep going now.

3930
03:31:45,190 --> 03:31:46,150
I think we're all good here.

3931
03:31:47,150 --> 03:31:47,990
Goodbye punk!

3932
03:31:49,250 --> 03:31:49,990
You know what?

3933
03:31:50,050 --> 03:31:51,630
I know we had our disagreances.

3934
03:31:51,850 --> 03:31:52,610
Wait, where am I going?

3935
03:31:53,550 --> 03:31:54,830
Wait, where am I going?

3936
03:31:55,530 --> 03:31:56,310
Oh, thank goodness.

3937
03:31:58,850 --> 03:31:59,650
We're going here.

3938
03:32:00,310 --> 03:32:02,590
I know we had our disagreances, but...

3939
03:32:04,010 --> 03:32:05,530
I really came to like you.

3940
03:32:09,940 --> 03:32:11,720
Is disagreances not a word?

3941
03:32:12,840 --> 03:32:13,440
What's a word?

3942
03:32:14,120 --> 03:32:18,420
We disagreed.

3943
03:32:18,520 --> 03:32:19,140
What's the word?

3944
03:32:20,700 --> 03:32:21,720
What am I thinking of?

3945
03:32:22,980 --> 03:32:23,500
Disagreements.

3946
03:32:26,100 --> 03:32:27,720
Guys, it's been a day for me.

3947
03:32:28,140 --> 03:32:37,660
I was combining, I think, grievances.

3948
03:32:38,570 --> 03:32:40,100
Happy lasts twice as long.

3949
03:32:40,220 --> 03:32:45,720
I was combining grievances and disagreements into disagreances.

3950
03:32:54,800 --> 03:32:55,660
Anyway.

3951
03:32:58,560 --> 03:32:59,180
Shut up.

3952
03:32:59,820 --> 03:33:00,880
I don't want to hear anymore.

3953
03:33:01,440 --> 03:33:03,160
Look at the dog.

3954
03:33:03,160 --> 03:33:03,800
Look at the dog.

3955
03:33:06,140 --> 03:33:07,400
Dog's chilling here.

3956
03:33:08,680 --> 03:33:09,160
Anyway.

3957
03:33:11,140 --> 03:33:13,080
You know any good bones?

3958
03:33:19,970 --> 03:33:22,350
I'm going to try and use that word more often.

3959
03:33:23,010 --> 03:33:26,630
If you do, people might look at you the same way you guys all reacted to me.

3960
03:33:28,210 --> 03:33:29,930
Might be like, what an idiot.

3961
03:33:30,650 --> 03:33:31,690
Go back to school.

3962
03:33:33,910 --> 03:33:34,770
Oh, music.

3963
03:33:34,930 --> 03:33:35,230
Thank you.

3964
03:33:37,410 --> 03:33:38,630
I like this band.

3965
03:33:46,870 --> 03:33:48,970
Birds that won't move.

3966
03:33:52,530 --> 03:33:53,750
Oh my god, the pigeons.

3967
03:33:55,370 --> 03:33:57,090
Why are the pigeons such a threat?

3968
03:34:01,470 --> 03:34:03,470
So if I do like this...

3969
03:34:03,470 --> 03:34:05,290
Oh my gosh, wait, this is the perfect scenario.

3970
03:34:08,290 --> 03:34:08,890
Wow!

3971
03:34:19,200 --> 03:34:20,540
That was awesome.

3972
03:34:24,060 --> 03:34:27,520
I like how our fetch has...

3973
03:34:28,400 --> 03:34:29,480
It's pretty good.

3974
03:34:34,750 --> 03:34:37,150
Birds straight up waiting for the last brain to move.

3975
03:34:39,110 --> 03:34:41,030
Why are the pigeons clawing like crows?

3976
03:34:41,890 --> 03:34:42,890
Don't worry about it.

3977
03:34:43,110 --> 03:34:44,510
Oh, we're not satisfied anymore.

3978
03:34:45,250 --> 03:34:46,250
I've lost!

3979
03:34:46,250 --> 03:34:49,490
Do you think we've talked to the dog?

3980
03:34:50,150 --> 03:34:52,770
Do you think we're just like, hey, what's up dog?

3981
03:34:53,010 --> 03:34:53,190
Wait.

3982
03:34:54,890 --> 03:35:00,510
We asked the dog, do you know of dog?

3983
03:35:01,890 --> 03:35:04,730
And the dog says, what's up dog?

3984
03:35:07,930 --> 03:35:09,650
We say, you!

3985
03:35:18,350 --> 03:35:21,950
You're the dog that's up in my beeswax.

3986
03:35:22,330 --> 03:35:25,790
None of your business.

3987
03:35:40,300 --> 03:35:41,480
Sorry I'm not too active.

3988
03:35:41,580 --> 03:35:42,720
Never apologize for that.

3989
03:35:43,180 --> 03:35:45,340
I wanted to say thank you for always helping to cheer me up.

3990
03:35:45,680 --> 03:35:48,880
You help to get me through work, which is why I have to watch the VODs instead of lives.

3991
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:50,080
That's no worries.

3992
03:35:50,180 --> 03:35:50,960
Thank you for following.

3993
03:35:51,560 --> 03:35:53,000
Thank you so much for the superchat.

3994
03:35:53,120 --> 03:35:54,060
I really appreciate it.

3995
03:35:54,060 --> 03:35:56,080
I really don't read enough.

3996
03:35:57,720 --> 03:35:59,960
I wish I had time.

3997
03:36:00,660 --> 03:36:02,240
Don't minus two me!

3998
03:36:05,180 --> 03:36:07,360
Every time I try before bed I just fall asleep.

3999
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:10,780
And plus tired sucks.

4000
03:36:13,280 --> 03:36:16,240
The humble up dog in the front seat.

4001
03:36:17,840 --> 03:36:20,560
You had a lot of literature back there.

4002
03:36:22,240 --> 03:36:23,020
Oh my god.

4003
03:36:23,320 --> 03:36:24,980
I thought he was gonna arrest the children.

4004
03:36:25,620 --> 03:36:27,580
Get off the highway children!

4005
03:36:37,210 --> 03:36:38,230
Oh wait, this works.

4006
03:36:39,910 --> 03:36:40,770
And we got money.

4007
03:36:40,990 --> 03:36:41,470
Let's go.

4008
03:36:43,950 --> 03:36:44,390
Dog?

4009
03:36:49,440 --> 03:36:50,700
I have to use this one.

4010
03:36:50,780 --> 03:36:53,420
Gosh, this would be the perfect setup for...

4011
03:36:54,520 --> 03:36:55,860
For the punk.

4012
03:36:57,160 --> 03:36:58,560
Give them the powder.

4013
03:36:59,140 --> 03:37:00,960
You guys are such maniacs.

4014
03:37:01,740 --> 03:37:04,220
You guys are absolute maniacs.

4015
03:37:04,220 --> 03:37:05,220
What's wrong with you?

4016
03:37:06,480 --> 03:37:08,660
Are we making it out of this one?

4017
03:37:12,120 --> 03:37:14,240
Okay, barely we're making it out.

4018
03:37:17,240 --> 03:37:19,440
But we're gonna get hit by the gas.

4019
03:37:45,190 --> 03:37:45,750
Please!

4020
03:37:46,170 --> 03:37:47,170
Actually, hold on.

4021
03:37:48,450 --> 03:37:50,410
I think it's time to jerry can just in case.

4022
03:37:53,370 --> 03:37:54,730
Just in case.

4023
03:37:55,710 --> 03:37:57,850
I have nothing else that I can use.

4024
03:37:59,190 --> 03:38:00,530
Nothing for gas.

4025
03:38:02,790 --> 03:38:03,770
Oh, E2?

4026
03:38:03,930 --> 03:38:04,210
Thank you.

4027
03:38:04,310 --> 03:38:05,750
Please, please.

4028
03:38:05,850 --> 03:38:09,890
E2, E2, E2.

4029
03:38:12,800 --> 03:38:14,020
Yeah, yeah.

4030
03:38:14,200 --> 03:38:15,000
Thank you guys.

4031
03:38:18,700 --> 03:38:19,740
I can...

4032
03:38:19,740 --> 03:38:21,380
Is this gonna remove tire?

4033
03:38:22,120 --> 03:38:22,380
No.

4034
03:38:23,360 --> 03:38:24,120
We'll just keep going.

4035
03:38:30,440 --> 03:38:30,960
Introspection.

4036
03:38:31,360 --> 03:38:33,540
Jeez, my back is hurting from these seats.

4037
03:38:35,280 --> 03:38:36,240
I need to stretch a bit.

4038
03:38:36,500 --> 03:38:37,480
I should just do it now.

4039
03:38:37,580 --> 03:38:38,160
Yes, stretch.

4040
03:38:38,500 --> 03:38:39,580
Everybody, stretch break.

4041
03:38:40,400 --> 03:38:41,880
Arch your back, squeezer.

4042
03:38:42,480 --> 03:38:43,060
Your bum.

4043
03:38:45,860 --> 03:38:48,680
Squeeze your shoulder blades together and stretch it out.

4044
03:38:52,730 --> 03:38:53,080
That

4045
03:38:56,180 --> 03:38:57,460
one felt good.

4046
03:38:58,680 --> 03:39:00,620
We made it!

4047
03:39:01,700 --> 03:39:03,160
We made it.

4048
03:39:03,220 --> 03:39:03,720
Let's go.

4049
03:39:04,200 --> 03:39:04,800
What's this?

4050
03:39:06,620 --> 03:39:07,540
Oh, it's a shop.

4051
03:39:09,500 --> 03:39:12,920
Decrease all durability cost of skills by one.

4052
03:39:12,920 --> 03:39:15,580
How does that help?

4053
03:39:16,120 --> 03:39:20,260
Whenever you lose two or more energy during a road event, trigger the effect of your wheels.

4054
03:39:21,500 --> 03:39:22,540
Oh, JTI.

4055
03:39:23,500 --> 03:39:24,540
Rally spoiler.

4056
03:39:25,320 --> 03:39:26,040
Rough roads.

4057
03:39:26,860 --> 03:39:28,740
Make a random thread on the road event skin.

4058
03:39:29,280 --> 03:39:29,900
Oh, the note...

4059
03:39:30,820 --> 03:39:32,820
Wait, star decal!

4060
03:39:34,060 --> 03:39:35,100
Cheaters tag.

4061
03:39:41,320 --> 03:39:42,180
Bigger rack.

4062
03:39:42,180 --> 03:39:42,180
Bigger rack?

4063
03:39:42,760 --> 03:39:43,840
Is this a bigger rack?

4064
03:39:44,720 --> 03:39:45,180
7x4.

4065
03:39:45,280 --> 03:39:46,260
What's our current one?

4066
03:39:48,180 --> 03:39:49,580
Oh, it is bigger.

4067
03:39:52,820 --> 03:39:54,160
I gotta move my eggs.

4068
03:39:55,460 --> 03:39:58,120
I gotta make room for it, but I don't have any room.

4069
03:39:58,720 --> 03:39:59,940
Wait, we can sell the spoiler.

4070
03:39:59,940 --> 03:40:00,000
Spoiler?

4071
03:40:02,580 --> 03:40:03,960
Thank you for bringing me though.

4072
03:40:04,100 --> 03:40:07,820
I'm going right now, but my hotel TV has YouTube streaming, so that's nice!

4073
03:40:08,160 --> 03:40:09,980
Also, the dog is a budget hitchhiker.

4074
03:40:11,260 --> 03:40:11,660
Vanguist!

4075
03:40:12,140 --> 03:40:13,020
I hope you're okay.

4076
03:40:14,440 --> 03:40:15,700
I put the seat down.

4077
03:40:16,380 --> 03:40:17,800
I just saw you guys saying that too.

4078
03:40:17,880 --> 03:40:18,360
That's so funny.

4079
03:40:18,620 --> 03:40:20,160
We all thought it at the same time.

4080
03:40:21,560 --> 03:40:22,880
Are you guys mean?

4081
03:40:25,440 --> 03:40:25,840
Nice.

4082
03:40:27,200 --> 03:40:27,720
Nice.

4083
03:40:32,520 --> 03:40:34,780
Now we... Wait, I bought this.

4084
03:40:35,540 --> 03:40:36,840
Is there a...

4085
03:40:38,480 --> 03:40:40,240
There's no place to put it on!

4086
03:40:41,360 --> 03:40:43,000
Guys, we messed up a little bit.

4087
03:40:44,580 --> 03:40:46,220
I might have messed up.

4088
03:40:46,420 --> 03:40:46,760
Oopsie!

4089
03:40:50,860 --> 03:40:51,600
It's fine.

4090
03:40:55,320 --> 03:40:56,620
The lost cat.

4091
03:40:58,780 --> 03:41:00,820
HomeGrad is so far away.

4092
03:41:03,980 --> 03:41:04,840
Just kidding.

4093
03:41:05,020 --> 03:41:05,620
Where am I?

4094
03:41:09,640 --> 03:41:10,200
Up here?

4095
03:41:12,680 --> 03:41:13,960
It's not that far.

4096
03:41:16,240 --> 03:41:17,420
Buy the jerry can.

4097
03:41:17,520 --> 03:41:18,260
Yes, thank you.

4098
03:41:20,240 --> 03:41:21,700
Mine is... Oh, it's low.

4099
03:41:21,700 --> 03:41:23,660
You know what I'm gonna use?

4100
03:41:25,180 --> 03:41:25,640
Sell.

4101
03:41:26,480 --> 03:41:26,800
Buy.

4102
03:41:29,560 --> 03:41:29,560
How

4103
03:41:33,140 --> 03:41:35,140
many days till the festival?

4104
03:41:36,160 --> 03:41:37,280
It's June 14th.

4105
03:41:38,340 --> 03:41:42,300
And I believe the festival is on the 30th.

4106
03:41:49,440 --> 03:41:50,960
So we have plenty of time.

4107
03:41:58,270 --> 03:42:00,450
But I have to find the cat.

4108
03:42:00,450 --> 03:42:00,590
Cat.

4109
03:42:04,240 --> 03:42:06,520
There's like no places to explore around here.

4110
03:42:15,700 --> 03:42:17,140
How am I tired?

4111
03:42:19,240 --> 03:42:20,420
Oh, nevermind.

4112
03:42:20,480 --> 03:42:21,240
I got rid of the tired.

4113
03:42:21,400 --> 03:42:22,540
Sorry, I misread it.

4114
03:42:31,490 --> 03:42:33,010
It's a random road event.

4115
03:42:33,570 --> 03:42:35,290
No, I think it was...

4116
03:42:37,330 --> 03:42:39,550
Here, I'm gonna... We'll go in a circle.

4117
03:42:40,070 --> 03:42:42,390
We'll go like boom, boom, boom.

4118
03:42:43,190 --> 03:42:45,110
And we'll hope that maybe we can find him.

4119
03:42:45,930 --> 03:42:46,230
You know?

4120
03:42:48,190 --> 03:42:49,610
How old is that pizza?

4121
03:42:49,770 --> 03:42:51,130
Pizza doesn't go bad.

4122
03:42:59,260 --> 03:43:00,860
It was a box event.

4123
03:43:02,700 --> 03:43:03,540
It was?

4124
03:43:10,330 --> 03:43:11,530
I'm lost.

4125
03:43:12,050 --> 03:43:13,470
I'm lost.

4126
03:43:14,770 --> 03:43:15,210
I'm lost.

4127
03:43:24,230 --> 03:43:24,670
Bark!

4128
03:43:27,290 --> 03:43:28,930
Why didn't I use my smokes?

4129
03:43:29,150 --> 03:43:30,390
I need to remember to use these.

4130
03:43:38,400 --> 03:43:38,840
Fetch!

4131
03:43:43,130 --> 03:43:44,330
I'm getting hungry.

4132
03:43:45,550 --> 03:43:45,990
Am I?

4133
03:43:46,330 --> 03:43:47,150
I'm hungry.

4134
03:43:48,330 --> 03:43:51,530
What do you mean that living off of berries and bananas is not enough?

4135
03:43:52,950 --> 03:43:55,710
What do you mean that we need more sustainable...

4136
03:43:57,430 --> 03:43:59,750
Excuse me, this is just ridiculous.

4137
03:44:00,730 --> 03:44:01,550
Eat the berries.

4138
03:44:01,870 --> 03:44:02,870
What's wrong with you?

4139
03:44:09,670 --> 03:44:11,070
What do you mean?

4140
03:44:12,410 --> 03:44:13,850
Happy White Day.

4141
03:44:15,650 --> 03:44:16,810
Oh, it is!

4142
03:44:22,450 --> 03:44:22,930
Well...

4143
03:44:23,610 --> 03:44:26,090
I got you guys something for Valentine's Day.

4144
03:44:28,430 --> 03:44:30,010
You know, White Day is when...

4145
03:44:31,110 --> 03:44:35,550
You guys reciprocate, you return what was given, you know?

4146
03:44:38,890 --> 03:44:39,370
So...

4147
03:44:57,340 --> 03:44:58,660
Thank you for the 10 gifts!

4148
03:44:59,800 --> 03:45:01,320
Rest in glitch bags, thank you.

4149
03:45:02,520 --> 03:45:03,000
So...

4150
03:45:03,920 --> 03:45:07,900
What are you getting me for, for White Day?

4151
03:45:10,040 --> 03:45:12,060
I have a brownie from the plane.

4152
03:45:12,220 --> 03:45:13,080
I'm gonna go get it.

4153
03:45:13,240 --> 03:45:13,700
Hold on!

4154
03:45:14,660 --> 03:45:17,540
I have a brownie from... I didn't... Hold on.

4155
03:45:17,720 --> 03:45:18,820
I'm gonna go get it.

4156
03:46:44,420 --> 03:46:45,760
What does that mean?

4157
03:46:49,080 --> 03:46:49,960
Let's try it.

4158
03:46:50,800 --> 03:46:52,480
Tonight will be a blood moon.

4159
03:46:52,600 --> 03:46:53,360
A lunar eclipse.

4160
03:46:53,960 --> 03:46:55,780
I'm going to go on a quick road trip to see it.

4161
03:46:57,440 --> 03:47:00,340
I noticed the moon earlier was so crazy actually.

4162
03:47:00,840 --> 03:47:01,800
I was like...

4163
03:47:01,800 --> 03:47:03,860
It looks so awesome.

4164
03:47:06,200 --> 03:47:07,400
The brownie smells good.

4165
03:47:08,720 --> 03:47:09,860
Is cocaine count for White Day?

4166
03:47:11,660 --> 03:47:13,760
Give you 5 bucks and a high five for White Day.

4167
03:47:15,020 --> 03:47:16,500
Also thanks for the rose.

4168
03:47:17,240 --> 03:47:20,380
My merch is non-existent, my singing is literally lethal.

4169
03:47:21,520 --> 03:47:22,400
So here's a soup bar.

4170
03:47:22,640 --> 03:47:23,900
What do you mean, merch?

4171
03:47:25,500 --> 03:47:26,540
Good morning, Minto.

4172
03:47:26,760 --> 03:47:28,580
Have a green... Thank you, Glendramon.

4173
03:47:28,720 --> 03:47:29,160
Good morning.

4174
03:47:29,600 --> 03:47:30,400
What kind of brownie?

4175
03:47:30,740 --> 03:47:32,540
I don't know, it's just whatever they gave on the plane.

4176
03:47:52,900 --> 03:47:56,220
It's more... It's more moist than I expected it to be.

4177
03:47:57,740 --> 03:47:58,540
It's yummy!

4178
03:48:00,120 --> 03:48:00,520
Yum!

4179
03:48:00,680 --> 03:48:01,580
For a plane brownie.

4180
03:48:02,460 --> 03:48:06,820
But it was like, sealed.

4181
03:48:07,700 --> 03:48:08,760
So...

4182
03:48:08,760 --> 03:48:10,620
It's brand is Bourbon.

4183
03:48:12,260 --> 03:48:15,320
Bourbon Noko Choco Brownie.

4184
03:48:16,520 --> 03:48:19,560
Bourbon Noko Choco Brownie.

4185
03:48:20,480 --> 03:48:20,820
This.

4186
03:48:23,120 --> 03:48:24,200
Oishisa Gyutto!

4187
03:48:28,000 --> 03:48:33,200
Should we also sing in a raspy red dress as a White Day gift?

4188
03:48:33,920 --> 03:48:35,040
Maybe one.

4189
03:48:39,440 --> 03:48:43,020
Sorry, I didn't mean to make myself so small.

4190
03:48:45,240 --> 03:48:46,640
My chat was stuck.

4191
03:48:57,900 --> 03:49:02,900
The legal limit is like around 0.05, right?

4192
03:49:03,120 --> 03:49:04,540
I wonder what my limit is.

4193
03:49:05,100 --> 03:49:07,540
Could I drink like five beers and be okay to drive?

4194
03:49:07,880 --> 03:49:10,060
I feel like after one pint, I get tipsy.

4195
03:49:10,880 --> 03:49:13,640
I'm sure I could drink a whole bottle of vodka and be fine.

4196
03:49:15,360 --> 03:49:18,420
There's gotta be something to drink somewhere under the seats.

4197
03:49:19,860 --> 03:49:21,800
I'm an addict, through and through.

4198
03:49:25,460 --> 03:49:26,740
No way.

4199
03:49:29,340 --> 03:49:32,100
We manifested some strong liquor.

4200
03:49:34,320 --> 03:49:37,580
Oh my goodness, it was underneath all of our books.

4201
03:49:38,340 --> 03:49:40,260
It's been there the whole time.

4202
03:49:40,920 --> 03:49:43,080
White Day filled with Whisperabu.

4203
03:49:45,120 --> 03:49:49,340
Oh my gosh.

4204
03:49:57,580 --> 03:50:01,460
For the festival, we are gonna be the partiest person.

4205
03:50:03,760 --> 03:50:05,960
Everyone will wanna hang out with us.

4206
03:50:06,660 --> 03:50:07,580
At the party.

4207
03:50:10,000 --> 03:50:11,040
Probably forgot it.

4208
03:50:11,180 --> 03:50:14,040
No, we made this happen.

4209
03:50:14,960 --> 03:50:20,800
If you can dream it, you can achieve it.

4210
03:50:21,320 --> 03:50:25,500
If you think real hard, then you're hard.

4211
03:50:26,000 --> 03:50:29,460
And then you'll find liquor under your seat.

4212
03:50:30,020 --> 03:50:32,080
White Day Giri Choco!

4213
03:50:32,640 --> 03:50:33,980
I'll accept Giri Choco.

4214
03:50:42,900 --> 03:50:43,780
Hold on.

4215
03:50:43,880 --> 03:50:46,080
I want the music, but I guess we gotta wait for the music.

4216
03:50:53,500 --> 03:50:55,020
Did I just hear a minky?

4217
03:51:03,500 --> 03:51:06,680
An artist I'm working with insists I pay you and not them.

4218
03:51:07,360 --> 03:51:09,120
Can I get five big booms for Taku?

4219
03:51:09,120 --> 03:51:10,140
Happy White Day.

4220
03:51:10,240 --> 03:51:11,980
This money goes towards buying more cocaine.

4221
03:51:14,260 --> 03:51:16,760
That's why my hair is so white, you guys.

4222
03:51:17,460 --> 03:51:18,780
It's not naturally this color.

4223
03:51:18,960 --> 03:51:20,880
I'm just covered in dust and powder.

4224
03:51:23,420 --> 03:51:26,300
I'll give you five big booms for that.

4225
03:51:27,720 --> 03:51:29,120
Wait, hold on.

4226
03:51:46,320 --> 03:51:48,420
I gave six big booms.

4227
03:51:49,420 --> 03:51:51,040
Is it okay?

4228
03:51:58,290 --> 03:51:59,920
We got an extra boom.

4229
03:52:02,230 --> 03:52:03,420
The sound is annoying.

4230
03:52:03,560 --> 03:52:04,420
Let's keep...

4231
03:52:07,890 --> 03:52:10,140
Take a look.

4232
03:52:10,940 --> 03:52:12,340
It's in a book.

4233
03:52:14,900 --> 03:52:17,080
Now the artist owes me 20 dollars.

4234
03:52:19,840 --> 03:52:21,340
Who are you working with?

4235
03:52:26,000 --> 03:52:28,280
Thank you for all the superdivides, you guys.

4236
03:52:28,380 --> 03:52:29,840
You didn't have to for White Day.

4237
03:52:29,920 --> 03:52:31,380
I was just kidding, okay?

4238
03:52:32,240 --> 03:52:33,600
I was just kidding.

4239
03:52:34,480 --> 03:52:36,560
Let's do a... eject.

4240
03:52:36,900 --> 03:52:37,660
Let's do a shuffle.

4241
03:52:39,000 --> 03:52:40,140
Oh, you said Taku.

4242
03:52:40,200 --> 03:52:40,720
I'm an idiot.

4243
03:52:45,220 --> 03:52:45,780
I'm kidding.

4244
03:52:49,060 --> 03:52:51,480
Hey, I've had a lot of cocaine, okay?

4245
03:52:58,820 --> 03:53:01,300
I've had so much, literally my ears are bleeding.

4246
03:53:08,750 --> 03:53:09,970
Welcome to Mambusha.

4247
03:53:10,050 --> 03:53:10,730
Thank you.

4248
03:53:11,310 --> 03:53:12,170
White Day resub.

4249
03:53:12,570 --> 03:53:13,650
Because I hate you.

4250
03:53:16,330 --> 03:53:17,050
No hate.

4251
03:53:17,310 --> 03:53:17,610
No hate.

4252
03:53:18,150 --> 03:53:18,770
No hate.

4253
03:53:18,910 --> 03:53:19,290
No hate.

4254
03:53:24,570 --> 03:53:25,990
That's why you're so giggly.

4255
03:53:26,390 --> 03:53:27,770
I just laugh at everything.

4256
03:53:28,250 --> 03:53:29,310
I can't help it.

4257
03:53:30,510 --> 03:53:31,610
I can't help it.

4258
03:53:34,150 --> 03:53:35,970
It's raw with laughter.

4259
03:53:37,450 --> 03:53:38,930
I don't know what to do.

4260
03:53:40,530 --> 03:53:41,430
That's fine.

4261
03:53:43,430 --> 03:53:44,290
Hi, dog.

4262
03:53:52,840 --> 03:53:55,260
I convinced my girlfriend to start the Metal Gear series.

4263
03:53:55,400 --> 03:53:56,300
We got another boss!

4264
03:53:56,940 --> 03:53:57,600
Let's go!

4265
03:53:58,640 --> 03:53:59,880
It's one quiet hot dog.

4266
03:53:59,960 --> 03:54:02,540
It's because... I mean, I guess I could... Let's see.

4267
03:54:03,140 --> 03:54:05,460
If I adjust the music here.

4268
03:54:06,640 --> 03:54:07,600
Maybe like that.

4269
03:54:10,180 --> 03:54:11,040
Like that.

4270
03:54:11,480 --> 03:54:12,460
So quiet.

4271
03:54:13,520 --> 03:54:15,280
Now the don't know sounds will be louder.

4272
03:54:15,520 --> 03:54:16,040
I apologize.

4273
03:54:17,920 --> 03:54:19,860
I should have just done that from the start instead.

4274
03:54:25,180 --> 03:54:25,540
Cigarette.

4275
03:54:25,540 --> 03:54:25,900
Cigarette.

4276
03:54:26,400 --> 03:54:26,760
Cigarette.

4277
03:54:33,390 --> 03:54:34,650
There's a White Day text?

4278
03:54:34,770 --> 03:54:35,030
No.

4279
03:54:36,890 --> 03:54:38,750
I'm just going to use this one because it's very specific.

4280
03:54:45,710 --> 03:54:46,910
I can see the ocean.

4281
03:54:47,130 --> 03:54:47,710
Nevermind, it's gone.

4282
03:54:47,970 --> 03:54:49,070
Oh, no, I can still see the ocean.

4283
03:54:49,930 --> 03:54:50,990
Fish hotel.

4284
03:54:52,430 --> 03:54:53,810
Oh, star hotel.

4285
03:54:55,310 --> 03:54:58,370
I thought this said fish.

4286
03:55:03,390 --> 03:55:04,470
Oh, god.

4287
03:55:08,750 --> 03:55:10,670
Wow, a sleeping bag.

4288
03:55:11,290 --> 03:55:11,850
Passive.

4289
03:55:11,990 --> 03:55:13,810
Don't become cold when resting in your car.

4290
03:55:13,970 --> 03:55:15,270
We don't because we have an AC.

4291
03:55:22,240 --> 03:55:23,720
Fish hotel fish.

4292
03:55:30,170 --> 03:55:32,610
Oh my god, the stickers are too cute.

4293
03:55:35,150 --> 03:55:37,310
Matchi the Rock, thank you so much for the 20 gifted.

4294
03:55:38,050 --> 03:55:38,850
Thank you, thank you.

4295
03:55:38,890 --> 03:55:40,210
I really, really appreciate it.

4296
03:55:40,510 --> 03:55:45,370
Gosh, why don't they sell any things that get rid of gas, you know?

4297
03:55:47,690 --> 03:55:50,450
Oh, there's like... Wait, where are we?

4298
03:55:52,170 --> 03:55:55,090
That's right, we're going in a triangle.

4299
03:55:56,950 --> 03:55:58,670
No, that's Lion.

4300
03:56:00,050 --> 03:56:01,730
How does triangle start again?

4301
03:56:02,210 --> 03:56:03,170
The Macross song.

4302
03:56:15,740 --> 03:56:16,220
I don't remember.

4303
03:56:20,510 --> 03:56:21,310
It's closed.

4304
03:56:21,470 --> 03:56:22,390
Oh, because it's 1AM.

4305
03:56:23,930 --> 03:56:25,030
Gas is still okay.

4306
03:56:25,390 --> 03:56:27,130
I'm surprised this place is still open.

4307
03:56:27,630 --> 03:56:28,210
Food mart.

4308
03:56:32,890 --> 03:56:35,330
I can get some more food.

4309
03:56:35,790 --> 03:56:36,470
What do we have?

4310
03:56:36,550 --> 03:56:38,250
We're tired and we're hungry.

4311
03:56:40,010 --> 03:56:41,390
I'll get some more food.

4312
03:56:53,190 --> 03:56:54,610
Oh wait, I don't need more food.

4313
03:56:54,630 --> 03:56:55,290
I have lots of pizza.

4314
03:57:07,650 --> 03:57:08,090
Papa...

4315
03:57:15,420 --> 03:57:16,540
Yes, yes, yes.

4316
03:57:16,580 --> 03:57:17,100
I remember now.

4317
03:57:17,180 --> 03:57:17,980
Thank you for the...

4318
03:57:17,980 --> 03:57:20,480
All you had to say was...

4319
03:57:24,420 --> 03:57:26,060
And I would have been like...

4320
03:57:30,700 --> 03:57:32,260
Let's sleep until morning.

4321
03:57:37,660 --> 03:57:39,540
Pizza isn't a food, it's a trophy.

4322
03:57:46,340 --> 03:57:47,620
Let's... Oh yeah, we ate.

4323
03:57:48,000 --> 03:57:49,120
We ate.

4324
03:57:50,340 --> 03:57:52,120
Alright, so we're searching for a cat.

4325
03:57:53,020 --> 03:57:56,340
We're searching, we're on the road looking for a little baby kitten.

4326
03:57:57,320 --> 03:58:00,720
Little guy, he's in the road, probably in a box.

4327
03:58:01,080 --> 03:58:02,800
If we get a box, we've got the cat.

4328
03:58:02,800 --> 03:58:04,940
Who gave this nerd a driver's license?

4329
03:58:05,080 --> 03:58:07,980
I'll have you know, I've never been in a car accident.

4330
03:58:12,100 --> 03:58:13,180
Hot holes.

4331
03:58:17,460 --> 03:58:18,860
Did you accept the cat quest?

4332
03:58:21,640 --> 03:58:22,180
Yes?

4333
03:58:26,020 --> 03:58:26,680
Did I?

4334
03:58:28,040 --> 03:58:28,600
Did I?

4335
03:58:28,980 --> 03:58:29,820
I did, right?

4336
03:58:38,780 --> 03:58:39,980
Yeah, we'll check after.

4337
03:58:41,260 --> 03:58:42,580
Now I'm scared.

4338
03:58:45,540 --> 03:58:47,180
Now, I'm not quite sure.

4339
03:58:52,120 --> 03:58:53,700
Now, I have no idea.

4340
03:58:57,880 --> 03:59:01,880
Oh well, this might have all been a waste of time.

4341
03:59:03,800 --> 03:59:07,580
This might have all been a big ol' waste of time.

4342
03:59:12,110 --> 03:59:14,790
This has all been a big ol' waste of time.

4343
03:59:14,910 --> 03:59:17,010
Wait, where did the cat... Oh shoot.

4344
03:59:24,850 --> 03:59:26,850
Where was the cat at?

4345
03:59:27,430 --> 03:59:28,770
Starting to get a little snacksy.

4346
03:59:29,510 --> 03:59:31,230
I should check if there's something in the door pockets.

4347
03:59:31,610 --> 03:59:33,530
Swallow some extra saliva and be happy.

4348
03:59:34,110 --> 03:59:35,210
Who says snacksy?

4349
03:59:35,650 --> 03:59:38,050
You can just say snacky or hungry or anything else.

4350
03:59:38,350 --> 03:59:39,770
No, I'm gonna manifest something.

4351
03:59:40,390 --> 03:59:41,850
Rummage through the door sleeves.

4352
03:59:42,630 --> 03:59:43,650
We get berries!

4353
03:59:45,830 --> 03:59:47,110
We get nuts!

4354
03:59:49,050 --> 03:59:49,930
Aw nuts.

4355
03:59:56,280 --> 03:59:57,920
Didn't you not take it because it was too far away?

4356
03:59:57,960 --> 03:59:58,840
That was a different one.

4357
03:59:59,520 --> 04:00:01,400
This one we were going in a triangle.

4358
04:00:03,120 --> 04:00:04,760
In hopes of finding the cat.

4359
04:00:08,000 --> 04:00:09,760
I can't believe I messed that up.

4360
04:00:09,920 --> 04:00:10,660
I'm sorry guys.

4361
04:00:19,370 --> 04:00:21,410
So many gas things.

4362
04:00:21,970 --> 04:00:24,230
This is so difficult.

4363
04:00:31,720 --> 04:00:32,120
Oh...

4364
04:00:46,560 --> 04:00:48,140
Wait, let go please.

4365
04:00:48,220 --> 04:00:49,000
Thank you.

4366
04:00:55,480 --> 04:00:57,440
At least install the new roof rack.

4367
04:00:57,540 --> 04:00:59,760
Oh yeah, we'll get to the city and we'll be able to install it.

4368
04:00:59,760 --> 04:01:00,160
That's true.

4369
04:01:01,680 --> 04:01:02,480
I couldn't before.

4370
04:01:16,900 --> 04:01:17,740
What's our status?

4371
04:01:18,560 --> 04:01:19,160
Starving?

4372
04:01:20,580 --> 04:01:21,180
Starving?

4373
04:01:21,620 --> 04:01:22,900
I haven't eaten anything.

4374
04:01:25,460 --> 04:01:26,300
It's okay.

4375
04:01:26,720 --> 04:01:27,540
We have berries.

4376
04:01:30,600 --> 04:01:31,800
And nuts.

4377
04:01:32,420 --> 04:01:33,280
There we go.

4378
04:01:35,020 --> 04:01:37,140
I'll give you a little bit of extra nuts.

4379
04:01:39,300 --> 04:01:41,480
Okay, we're back in the city.

4380
04:01:41,800 --> 04:01:42,460
Where are we?

4381
04:01:44,180 --> 04:01:45,720
We're in Karlo.

4382
04:01:45,720 --> 04:01:53,760
So, Kongrad was where the cat mission was supposed to end, but I think...

4383
04:01:53,760 --> 04:01:53,980
Wait.

4384
04:01:55,740 --> 04:01:57,100
Actually I'm confused.

4385
04:01:57,240 --> 04:01:57,860
I don't remember.

4386
04:02:00,480 --> 04:02:02,320
I have no idea actually.

4387
04:02:14,500 --> 04:02:19,540
We have so much more space for activities.

4388
04:02:23,360 --> 04:02:24,120
Let's see.

4389
04:02:24,420 --> 04:02:24,980
And then shop.

4390
04:02:25,440 --> 04:02:26,440
We'll just sell this, baby.

4391
04:02:34,760 --> 04:02:35,800
There's a lot of powder up there.

4392
04:02:35,860 --> 04:02:36,440
It's snow!

4393
04:02:37,540 --> 04:02:40,940
It's been a cold, frigid winter season.

4394
04:02:44,880 --> 04:02:46,240
It's not what you think.

4395
04:02:48,460 --> 04:02:50,860
It's just been quite chilly.

4396
04:02:52,460 --> 04:02:53,240
It's June.

4397
04:02:53,540 --> 04:02:54,800
Oh, you're right.

4398
04:03:01,820 --> 04:03:02,360
No.

4399
04:03:02,360 --> 04:03:04,240
It's in the mountains.

4400
04:03:05,880 --> 04:03:07,720
In the mountains it's always winter.

4401
04:03:16,340 --> 04:03:17,420
The carburetor.

4402
04:03:18,660 --> 04:03:19,720
We got the AC.

4403
04:03:20,580 --> 04:03:21,480
I think we're okay.

4404
04:03:22,400 --> 04:03:27,480
I do though want to look at our skills a little bit, because if we can find something that helps with gas...

4405
04:03:27,480 --> 04:03:29,640
I think that would be big news.

4406
04:03:29,640 --> 04:03:30,480
Oh, see like this.

4407
04:03:31,380 --> 04:03:32,800
This is big news!

4408
04:03:33,620 --> 04:03:34,700
Which one should we get rid of?

4409
04:03:34,740 --> 04:03:35,280
Maybe this one.

4410
04:03:35,760 --> 04:03:36,480
Get rid of this one.

4411
04:03:37,900 --> 04:03:38,460
There we go.

4412
04:03:38,980 --> 04:03:39,340
Perfect.

4413
04:03:40,260 --> 04:03:41,560
This one's kind of good too.

4414
04:03:41,820 --> 04:03:45,160
If you escape after using the skill, gain 3 armor.

4415
04:03:46,860 --> 04:03:48,080
This one has how many uses?

4416
04:03:52,420 --> 04:03:55,440
If you get a perfect with the skill, gain 1 gas.

4417
04:03:55,540 --> 04:03:55,900
Okay, cool.

4418
04:04:01,930 --> 04:04:03,590
Cost 3 gas.

4419
04:04:03,870 --> 04:04:07,350
Cost 1 less for each exhausted skill?

4420
04:04:08,750 --> 04:04:10,710
Like I'm tired?

4421
04:04:17,580 --> 04:04:19,700
Destroy 1 to 3 random threat.

4422
04:04:23,900 --> 04:04:25,460
Oh, this one's good too actually.

4423
04:04:27,200 --> 04:04:29,580
This one has 5 uses.

4424
04:04:31,900 --> 04:04:34,520
This one has 3 uses.

4425
04:04:34,520 --> 04:04:38,360
But we have more energy than we have anything else, you know what I mean?

4426
04:04:41,280 --> 04:04:42,640
1 gas, 3 uses.

4427
04:04:47,960 --> 04:04:49,600
Your skill has exhausted.

4428
04:04:51,560 --> 04:04:52,960
Oh, I think it means no more uses.

4429
04:04:53,440 --> 04:04:54,920
Ah, I see, I see.

4430
04:04:55,660 --> 04:04:57,520
So it was...

4431
04:04:59,700 --> 04:05:00,360
This one?

4432
04:05:01,480 --> 04:05:02,640
No, this one?

4433
04:05:03,240 --> 04:05:05,360
Cost 1 less for each... Ah, I see, I see, I see.

4434
04:05:05,400 --> 04:05:06,580
So after... Okay, okay.

4435
04:05:08,980 --> 04:05:10,120
Been lurking, vibing.

4436
04:05:10,480 --> 04:05:12,060
Well, half asleep, but should probably head to bed.

4437
04:05:12,140 --> 04:05:13,180
I'll catch the rest of the VOD later.

4438
04:05:13,240 --> 04:05:14,560
Have a good rest of the night and stream.

4439
04:05:15,000 --> 04:05:15,720
Thank you, Crow!

4440
04:05:16,280 --> 04:05:17,020
Thank you!

4441
04:05:31,020 --> 04:05:31,340
Okay.

4442
04:05:37,280 --> 04:05:39,220
I did want to get to the festival tonight.

4443
04:05:39,520 --> 04:05:41,060
I think we'll just skip the cat.

4444
04:05:41,900 --> 04:05:44,460
Kind of want to get at least an ending, you know what I mean?

4445
04:05:44,900 --> 04:05:46,080
I think we're good for now.

4446
04:05:46,420 --> 04:05:47,180
I think this is okay.

4447
04:05:47,180 --> 04:05:52,160
Actually, let's... Maybe it's playing it too safe, but let's switch this.

4448
04:05:53,520 --> 04:05:55,560
I think this one...

4449
04:05:55,560 --> 04:05:57,200
And this one is the threat.

4450
04:06:01,140 --> 04:06:01,840
Get gas.

4451
04:06:02,620 --> 04:06:04,200
I have...

4452
04:06:04,200 --> 04:06:06,180
Do I have a jerrycan?

4453
04:06:06,720 --> 04:06:09,720
I have a full jerrycan, but we can fill up, I suppose.

4454
04:06:11,300 --> 04:06:12,600
I'm starting to get sleepy.

4455
04:06:14,700 --> 04:06:16,080
How long has it been?

4456
04:06:17,740 --> 04:06:19,240
It's already been four hours.

4457
04:06:19,400 --> 04:06:19,600
Crazy.

4458
04:06:24,060 --> 04:06:24,820
We'll fill up.

4459
04:06:26,820 --> 04:06:29,200
We're below $100, but we're okay.

4460
04:06:30,160 --> 04:06:31,280
Let's... Wait, what am I?

4461
04:06:31,500 --> 04:06:32,000
I'm tired?

4462
04:06:33,180 --> 04:06:33,920
We'll sleep.

4463
04:06:36,120 --> 04:06:37,620
We're gonna go to the festival.

4464
04:06:39,260 --> 04:06:41,100
And we're hungry and we're dirty.

4465
04:06:42,140 --> 04:06:43,280
It's okay, we got soap.

4466
04:06:44,240 --> 04:06:46,360
And we got... What's hungry?

4467
04:06:46,540 --> 04:06:46,840
Hunger.

4468
04:06:48,040 --> 04:06:48,500
Alright.

4469
04:06:49,020 --> 04:06:49,360
Let's go.

4470
04:06:51,640 --> 04:06:52,500
Where are we going?

4471
04:06:55,000 --> 04:06:56,840
We'll just go in a circle.

4472
04:07:00,710 --> 04:07:01,170
Pizza?

4473
04:07:01,350 --> 04:07:08,390
I'll start eating the pizza once we're out of the smaller foods, because then we can free up space with the small one stuff, you know?

4474
04:07:12,520 --> 04:07:14,840
I've been driving this one more than my actual car.

4475
04:07:14,940 --> 04:07:15,420
I know, right?

4476
04:07:16,480 --> 04:07:20,540
I wonder if I'll forget everything I learned in school someday.

4477
04:07:21,480 --> 04:07:24,680
I hope I at least remember the psychology and philosophy classes.

4478
04:07:25,120 --> 04:07:26,740
I hope I remember physics and math.

4479
04:07:26,960 --> 04:07:29,000
I like some simple formulas at least.

4480
04:07:29,500 --> 04:07:32,140
Or will all the new thoughts I have push out the old?

4481
04:07:38,310 --> 04:07:38,830
B?

4482
04:07:38,830 --> 04:07:39,530
What's B?

4483
04:07:40,630 --> 04:07:42,110
I'm already starting to forget those.

4484
04:07:42,430 --> 04:07:43,430
F equals 2X?

4485
04:07:43,630 --> 04:07:44,210
Oh no.

4486
04:07:44,210 --> 04:07:45,950
Oh no.

4487
04:07:47,230 --> 04:07:48,610
We're distracted.

4488
04:07:48,870 --> 04:07:50,050
We're thinking about math.

4489
04:07:50,670 --> 04:07:51,850
We're thinking about math!

4490
04:07:55,020 --> 04:07:56,220
Hold on a second.

4491
04:07:57,900 --> 04:07:59,820
I'm also a little distracted.

4492
04:08:18,740 --> 04:08:19,720
Sorry.

4493
04:08:20,800 --> 04:08:21,380
Messages.

4494
04:08:21,820 --> 04:08:22,180
People.

4495
04:08:22,560 --> 04:08:22,900
Stuff.

4496
04:08:24,880 --> 04:08:25,580
Nice!

4497
04:08:28,320 --> 04:08:29,300
And...

4498
04:08:29,300 --> 04:08:30,480
Do this one.

4499
04:08:33,020 --> 04:08:35,820
Time flies when you're doing white powder on the car roof.

4500
04:08:36,180 --> 04:08:39,400
I feel like that would be a scene from a Joker movie, you know?

4501
04:08:42,660 --> 04:08:44,840
I'm doing powder on the roof!

4502
04:08:55,690 --> 04:08:56,770
Maybe a future one.

4503
04:08:56,850 --> 04:08:58,630
I don't think there will ever be a future Joker.

4504
04:08:59,970 --> 04:09:02,690
At least not in the Joker that we know.

4505
04:09:03,450 --> 04:09:03,770
Right?

4506
04:09:06,210 --> 04:09:06,690
Perhaps.

4507
04:09:07,830 --> 04:09:09,470
Why is there death on the children?

4508
04:09:12,750 --> 04:09:13,950
Let's get rid of that.

4509
04:09:14,130 --> 04:09:14,910
That seems important.

4510
04:09:15,670 --> 04:09:16,870
And we'll get rid of this one too.

4511
04:09:22,440 --> 04:09:23,500
Not that Joker.

4512
04:09:24,180 --> 04:09:24,860
What Joker?

4513
04:09:26,660 --> 04:09:27,720
What do you mean spoilers?

4514
04:09:27,860 --> 04:09:28,680
I never saw it.

4515
04:09:30,000 --> 04:09:31,600
Doesn't the guy not like the movie?

4516
04:09:34,940 --> 04:09:36,120
What do you mean spoilers?

4517
04:09:37,920 --> 04:09:40,600
If you're saying spoilers, you're saying spoilers!

4518
04:09:40,600 --> 04:09:40,880
Spoilers.

4519
04:09:58,260 --> 04:09:59,180
Spoilers the Joker.

4520
04:10:00,120 --> 04:10:07,800
I convinced my grandma to play MGS Snake Eater, but she keeps getting confused because she was alive during that time period, so she doesn't remember that stuff happened.

4521
04:10:18,870 --> 04:10:20,390
Stop confusing your grandma!

4522
04:10:23,410 --> 04:10:24,950
How many more of these do I have?

4523
04:10:25,630 --> 04:10:26,370
I just realized.

4524
04:10:26,850 --> 04:10:29,470
Also, I don't want to use them too much because of my durability, but...

4525
04:10:30,490 --> 04:10:31,890
Oh, one out of five left.

4526
04:10:31,950 --> 04:10:32,130
Okay.

4527
04:10:33,850 --> 04:10:35,630
I think I've been using it too willy-nilly.

4528
04:10:41,760 --> 04:10:46,700
Grandma will suddenly pull out that she was also some secret agent.

4529
04:10:46,840 --> 04:10:47,340
She'll be like...

4530
04:10:47,980 --> 04:10:49,320
Oh, Eva!

4531
04:10:50,300 --> 04:10:52,920
I haven't heard that name in a long time!

4532
04:10:53,860 --> 04:10:54,380
Adamska!

4533
04:11:00,740 --> 04:11:02,260
Joker 2 was final.

4534
04:11:02,380 --> 04:11:03,620
Oh, so it is the last movie?

4535
04:11:03,620 --> 04:11:05,740
Of the Joker, Joker?

4536
04:11:06,200 --> 04:11:07,100
Of the Jorker?

4537
04:11:07,640 --> 04:11:09,560
The Jorker.

4538
04:11:16,530 --> 04:11:18,250
This is a big city, right?

4539
04:11:20,090 --> 04:11:21,170
Let's go exploring.

4540
04:11:25,990 --> 04:11:27,710
I'm not afraid of anyone anymore.

4541
04:11:31,350 --> 04:11:33,270
I have a knife.

4542
04:11:33,570 --> 04:11:34,710
Did I just go in a big old circle?

4543
04:11:36,990 --> 04:11:39,570
Wait, do you think we can get our punk back?

4544
04:11:42,510 --> 04:11:43,110
Punk!

4545
04:11:43,150 --> 04:11:44,150
Punk, I miss you!

4546
04:11:45,830 --> 04:11:46,790
Punk, please!

4547
04:11:48,710 --> 04:11:50,110
Come back, Punk!

4548
04:11:51,170 --> 04:11:52,650
I miss you, Punk!

4549
04:11:55,830 --> 04:11:56,430
Punk!

4550
04:11:57,110 --> 04:11:58,350
Unfortunately, no.

4551
04:11:59,050 --> 04:12:01,710
That's the worst trade-off.

4552
04:12:01,830 --> 04:12:03,710
Here I was thinking like...

4553
04:12:03,710 --> 04:12:05,570
Oh, we get the dog and...

4554
04:12:07,450 --> 04:12:08,050
Um...

4555
04:12:08,350 --> 04:12:17,490
It's not so bad because you are so patient and you keep the dog and also the punk who is a bit of an asshole.

4556
04:12:18,150 --> 04:12:23,830
And then you get all the dog abilities and it's cool and it's all good.

4557
04:12:23,930 --> 04:12:26,390
And then he just leaves you.

4558
04:12:27,710 --> 04:12:28,610
A dog!

4559
04:12:29,710 --> 04:12:33,410
The punk's dog befriends the snarling dog!

4560
04:12:35,910 --> 04:12:41,010
I think that's a rare... Wait, I think we just got a... And it's for spray paint?

4561
04:12:41,110 --> 04:12:42,570
I'm gonna make lose it.

4562
04:12:43,650 --> 04:12:46,670
Here I thought we were about to get some awesome epic item.

4563
04:12:47,710 --> 04:12:49,630
Could only be obtained late game.

4564
04:12:53,230 --> 04:12:54,470
I am a little lost.

4565
04:12:57,270 --> 04:12:58,230
Dog maxing.

4566
04:13:04,280 --> 04:13:05,500
I'm a little lost.

4567
04:13:06,060 --> 04:13:07,580
Is this where the dog was?

4568
04:13:07,580 --> 04:13:10,140
No, this is where I was.

4569
04:13:10,700 --> 04:13:11,600
And then here.

4570
04:13:20,460 --> 04:13:21,140
Ravioli?

4571
04:13:21,780 --> 04:13:23,380
That does not need to be cooked.

4572
04:13:24,440 --> 04:13:27,700
I've eaten many, many of raw ravioli.

4573
04:13:29,340 --> 04:13:30,360
Beige spray.

4574
04:13:30,740 --> 04:13:31,820
I'm gonna sell all this.

4575
04:13:32,600 --> 04:13:33,360
Yellow spray.

4576
04:13:40,200 --> 04:13:41,020
Let's see.

4577
04:13:41,280 --> 04:13:42,600
What do we got in here?

4578
04:13:44,460 --> 04:13:45,580
A melodica!

4579
04:13:45,920 --> 04:13:46,600
That's fine.

4580
04:13:47,360 --> 04:13:49,760
Should we get another... A Buddha bouncer.

4581
04:13:51,660 --> 04:13:53,020
Very spiritual.

4582
04:13:56,320 --> 04:14:00,620
I have no creative message, but still wanted to super anyway.

4583
04:14:01,700 --> 04:14:02,580
So, hello.

4584
04:14:05,180 --> 04:14:05,780
Hi.

4585
04:14:05,780 --> 04:14:06,820
Hi, Ashes.

4586
04:14:07,200 --> 04:14:08,960
What do you mean, why?

4587
04:14:10,220 --> 04:14:11,300
Oh no, wait.

4588
04:14:11,460 --> 04:14:12,140
My chat froze.

4589
04:14:12,760 --> 04:14:13,380
Hold on, guys.

4590
04:14:15,020 --> 04:14:16,040
I'm so sorry.

4591
04:14:17,520 --> 04:14:18,060
My chat.

4592
04:14:29,730 --> 04:14:30,330
Hi.

4593
04:14:30,870 --> 04:14:31,470
Hi.

4594
04:14:32,050 --> 04:14:32,230
Hi.

4595
04:14:32,230 --> 04:14:32,730
I can see you.

4596
04:14:32,830 --> 04:14:33,450
I can see you.

4597
04:14:34,150 --> 04:14:36,070
I can see you, Tropius.

4598
04:14:36,450 --> 04:14:37,490
I always see you.

4599
04:14:37,870 --> 04:14:39,270
I always see you.

4600
04:14:40,570 --> 04:14:41,170
Okay.

4601
04:14:41,870 --> 04:14:42,210
Hi.

4602
04:14:42,910 --> 04:14:43,510
Hi.

4603
04:14:44,330 --> 04:14:45,270
Let's see.

4604
04:14:45,550 --> 04:14:46,910
Oh, a mysterious book.

4605
04:14:47,390 --> 04:14:48,590
We're grabbing that for sure.

4606
04:14:49,810 --> 04:14:52,630
We're grabbing that for sure.

4607
04:14:54,790 --> 04:14:59,710
And we'll... Oh, I was gonna say we'll stay in the hotel tonight, but I don't think we've got enough money.

4608
04:15:01,870 --> 04:15:02,330
Ten.

4609
04:15:09,100 --> 04:15:11,000
I thought that was my actual phone.

4610
04:15:12,780 --> 04:15:15,040
I guess we can do a bartender job.

4611
04:15:16,900 --> 04:15:17,360
And...

4612
04:15:22,390 --> 04:15:24,250
Yeah, just make our way back.

4613
04:15:27,050 --> 04:15:27,690
Don't drink.

4614
04:15:27,770 --> 04:15:28,790
I'm not gonna get drunk.

4615
04:15:29,130 --> 04:15:30,030
I'm not a lightweight.

4616
04:15:30,370 --> 04:15:30,890
I'm drunk!

4617
04:15:32,950 --> 04:15:34,030
Everybody watch out.

4618
04:15:34,090 --> 04:15:37,450
I'm a crazed... I'm a crazed drunker on the road.

4619
04:15:37,970 --> 04:15:39,350
I hope there's no cops here.

4620
04:15:40,590 --> 04:15:41,830
I am the law.

4621
04:15:43,350 --> 04:15:46,490
My car also decided to crap out and now I need to get a new one.

4622
04:15:46,630 --> 04:15:47,050
Twinsies.

4623
04:15:47,270 --> 04:15:48,310
Oh, it's me.

4624
04:15:48,350 --> 04:15:48,910
What the heck?

4625
04:15:51,370 --> 04:15:52,830
What is with all the people?

4626
04:15:53,110 --> 04:15:54,270
What is with... What is this?

4627
04:15:56,450 --> 04:15:58,850
Did all the cars get together?

4628
04:15:58,930 --> 04:15:59,810
Where'd the hotel go?

4629
04:15:59,910 --> 04:16:00,370
Am I crazy?

4630
04:16:00,910 --> 04:16:01,630
No, I'm drunk.

4631
04:16:03,270 --> 04:16:04,290
Oh, here it is.

4632
04:16:08,020 --> 04:16:09,220
25 hours?

4633
04:16:09,400 --> 04:16:09,980
Excuse me.

4634
04:16:13,260 --> 04:16:14,880
I made a mistake.

4635
04:16:23,180 --> 04:16:26,840
We've literally wasted an entire day.

4636
04:16:28,080 --> 04:16:30,640
We had the best sleep of our lives.

4637
04:16:33,760 --> 04:16:37,540
Snake, let's have the best sleep of our lives.

4638
04:16:41,140 --> 04:16:41,480
Alright.

4639
04:16:43,200 --> 04:16:44,680
Only two more places.

4640
04:16:45,460 --> 04:16:46,840
Two more and then we're at the festival.

4641
04:16:47,540 --> 04:16:51,720
And it's the 17th and we need to get there.

4642
04:16:54,720 --> 04:16:55,400
Calendar.

4643
04:16:56,320 --> 04:16:57,380
Oh, we're so good.

4644
04:16:57,740 --> 04:16:58,440
We got this.

4645
04:16:59,100 --> 04:17:00,720
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

4646
04:17:00,720 --> 04:17:04,880
If I get there, do I have to get there like on the day?

4647
04:17:12,940 --> 04:17:14,500
Thank you so much for the 50k.

4648
04:17:14,580 --> 04:17:15,580
Thank you.

4649
04:17:15,900 --> 04:17:16,860
Music, Dokka.

4650
04:17:17,720 --> 04:17:18,460
Thank you.

4651
04:17:19,700 --> 04:17:20,700
Thank you.

4652
04:17:22,140 --> 04:17:22,580
Shuffle.

4653
04:17:27,040 --> 04:17:28,040
7192 channel.

4654
04:17:28,180 --> 04:17:29,060
Thank you for the raid.

4655
04:17:29,160 --> 04:17:29,820
Thank you so much.

4656
04:17:30,580 --> 04:17:30,860
Pause.

4657
04:17:36,970 --> 04:17:37,730
Hot dogs.

4658
04:17:44,360 --> 04:17:47,040
Oh, I just realized I saw my pin message unpin.

4659
04:17:48,100 --> 04:17:48,560
Oopsie.

4660
04:17:50,620 --> 04:17:54,600
Alright, let's see what we got going on here.

4661
04:17:57,240 --> 04:17:59,460
If I do this one...

4662
04:18:03,510 --> 04:18:07,290
It like literally gets everything but the one thing that will cause us harm.

4663
04:18:07,690 --> 04:18:08,470
But we have armor.

4664
04:18:10,850 --> 04:18:11,650
It's okay.

4665
04:18:14,050 --> 04:18:14,750
Hey, Miki.

4666
04:18:14,850 --> 04:18:15,090
Hi, chat.

4667
04:18:15,190 --> 04:18:15,670
Have a good stream.

4668
04:18:15,810 --> 04:18:16,430
Thank you.

4669
04:18:16,930 --> 04:18:17,830
Thank you, thank you.

4670
04:18:21,850 --> 04:18:23,470
Let's use you.

4671
04:18:28,280 --> 04:18:30,940
Welcome, welcome to Keep Driving.

4672
04:18:31,180 --> 04:18:32,880
It's a roguelike...

4673
04:18:35,380 --> 04:18:37,020
exploration car game.

4674
04:18:37,640 --> 04:18:38,220
Oh, what am I?

4675
04:18:38,540 --> 04:18:39,080
Am I hungry?

4676
04:18:41,180 --> 04:18:42,100
I'm hungry.

4677
04:18:42,360 --> 04:18:43,800
I'm gonna eat berries.

4678
04:18:44,160 --> 04:18:45,480
I'm out of berries!

4679
04:18:47,340 --> 04:18:48,200
I'm gonna eat nuts.

4680
04:18:49,620 --> 04:18:51,160
Eat large amounts of junk food.

4681
04:18:51,800 --> 04:18:52,360
Glutton?

4682
04:18:52,500 --> 04:18:53,640
Become hungry more often.

4683
04:18:53,780 --> 04:18:54,760
This game hates me.

4684
04:18:56,940 --> 04:18:58,500
What do you mean junk food?

4685
04:18:59,040 --> 04:19:00,720
I've been eating berries.

4686
04:19:02,690 --> 04:19:05,430
I've been eating berries for most of my life.

4687
04:19:08,930 --> 04:19:11,070
How are nuts junk food?

4688
04:19:11,650 --> 04:19:15,610
Like, I know they're kind of fatty, but that's a good, that's a genuine protein, okay?

4689
04:19:19,390 --> 04:19:19,830
Gosh.

4690
04:19:20,530 --> 04:19:21,430
This game.

4691
04:19:22,970 --> 04:19:24,050
Berries are junk.

4692
04:19:24,230 --> 04:19:26,690
I mean, it's better than like Twinkie.

4693
04:19:27,890 --> 04:19:29,750
Or this brownie I'm eating, for real.

4694
04:19:30,570 --> 04:19:31,930
Going to eat berries.

4695
04:19:32,090 --> 04:19:32,730
Berries, what?

4696
04:19:32,810 --> 04:19:34,090
I'm gonna eat berries ass.

4697
04:19:35,770 --> 04:19:37,130
Don't tell her I said that.

4698
04:19:42,960 --> 04:19:44,580
I'm gonna have to repair my car soon.

4699
04:19:58,560 --> 04:19:59,520
So many...

4700
04:20:10,240 --> 04:20:11,340
I like this song.

4701
04:20:11,520 --> 04:20:12,620
Is this the werewolves?

4702
04:20:14,980 --> 04:20:16,360
Is this the werewolf one?

4703
04:20:20,930 --> 04:20:21,370
Yeah?

4704
04:20:25,420 --> 04:20:26,480
You know what?

4705
04:20:27,860 --> 04:20:28,900
Durability be damned.

4706
04:20:29,000 --> 04:20:30,020
We'll just repair our car.

4707
04:20:31,080 --> 04:20:31,740
Oh yeah, there it is.

4708
04:20:31,800 --> 04:20:32,780
The werewolf asshole.

4709
04:20:38,450 --> 04:20:38,930
Borzoi.

4710
04:20:39,570 --> 04:20:41,230
We got our dog with us.

4711
04:20:41,310 --> 04:20:43,830
Well, he's not originally our dog.

4712
04:20:44,490 --> 04:20:47,750
We kind of... Well, I don't think... We didn't steal him.

4713
04:20:48,530 --> 04:20:51,690
But I don't think the guy thought we were gonna leave the city, you know?

4714
04:20:52,450 --> 04:20:58,230
He said watch over my dog and then we like ditched him.

4715
04:21:03,030 --> 04:21:03,770
So...

4716
04:21:03,770 --> 04:21:06,190
It's a little... It's a little funny.

4717
04:21:10,060 --> 04:21:11,440
It's a little funny.

4718
04:21:16,100 --> 04:21:17,160
Oh, berry.

4719
04:21:18,600 --> 04:21:19,560
Berries here?

4720
04:21:19,740 --> 04:21:20,600
Oh, you what?

4721
04:21:36,120 --> 04:21:37,280
Who snitched?

4722
04:21:37,880 --> 04:21:38,360
Huh?

4723
04:21:38,660 --> 04:21:39,380
Who snitched?

4724
04:21:47,680 --> 04:21:48,460
Sorry, berry.

4725
04:21:48,560 --> 04:21:49,220
I didn't mean that.

4726
04:21:49,300 --> 04:21:51,380
I've just been stuck in the snow for too long.

4727
04:21:52,160 --> 04:21:55,980
The... The... The... The... Brain frost.

4728
04:21:57,240 --> 04:21:58,200
The permafrost.

4729
04:22:01,340 --> 04:22:01,820
The...

4730
04:22:01,820 --> 04:22:03,200
How do I say?

4731
04:22:05,160 --> 04:22:07,500
Oh my gosh, I keep losing money to the tolls.

4732
04:22:07,500 --> 04:22:09,880
That was such...

4733
04:22:11,440 --> 04:22:12,340
What

4734
04:22:19,940 --> 04:22:24,960
is it when you're... When you're... Oh, a banana.

4735
04:22:26,060 --> 04:22:30,280
When your stuff is... When you get frozen, you know?

4736
04:22:30,880 --> 04:22:33,040
That was bizarre.

4737
04:22:33,440 --> 04:22:34,000
I didn't even notice.

4738
04:22:46,870 --> 04:22:47,470
Frostbite!

4739
04:22:47,610 --> 04:22:48,150
Thank you.

4740
04:22:49,130 --> 04:22:50,210
Yeah, frostbite.

4741
04:22:51,070 --> 04:22:51,790
Almost a year.

4742
04:22:54,850 --> 04:22:55,690
Almost a year.

4743
04:22:56,610 --> 04:22:58,370
No one else is going as slow as us.

4744
04:22:58,950 --> 04:22:59,530
Unlucky.

4745
04:23:02,970 --> 04:23:04,130
That is unlucky.

4746
04:23:05,410 --> 04:23:06,590
Oh, that is unlucky.

4747
04:23:09,030 --> 04:23:10,250
We'll have enough durability.

4748
04:23:10,690 --> 04:23:10,990
Surely.

4749
04:23:12,730 --> 04:23:13,210
Surely.

4750
04:23:17,950 --> 04:23:18,970
I think we'll be okay.

4751
04:23:19,830 --> 04:23:20,070
Ouch.

4752
04:23:22,130 --> 04:23:22,890
Floor it.

4753
04:23:22,890 --> 04:23:23,810
Meow.

4754
04:23:26,290 --> 04:23:27,950
I'm following the rules.

4755
04:23:28,190 --> 04:23:28,650
I am.

4756
04:23:32,250 --> 04:23:35,110
My setup is not so great, I'll be honest.

4757
04:23:35,890 --> 04:23:39,430
I'm just barely scrapping by through all these fights, I feel.

4758
04:23:42,070 --> 04:23:43,130
We got money!

4759
04:23:43,230 --> 04:23:43,650
Let's go!

4760
04:23:46,490 --> 04:23:48,030
Oh yeah, we're so cooked.

4761
04:23:48,670 --> 04:23:50,190
This is not a repair center.

4762
04:23:53,330 --> 04:23:54,490
We're so cooked.

4763
04:23:54,830 --> 04:23:57,050
Okay, let me... Let's switch out some cards.

4764
04:24:01,730 --> 04:24:03,190
We'll replace this with this.

4765
04:24:03,570 --> 04:24:03,990
There we go.

4766
04:24:04,070 --> 04:24:04,750
What we had originally.

4767
04:24:05,790 --> 04:24:06,290
That should be okay.

4768
04:24:06,650 --> 04:24:07,630
Hello, windows.

4769
04:24:08,370 --> 04:24:09,930
Turn off reminders, thank you.

4770
04:24:15,030 --> 04:24:18,610
Did you know it takes 10 million bananas to die of radiation poisoning?

4771
04:24:19,470 --> 04:24:21,230
Oh yeah, that's what will kill you.

4772
04:24:22,870 --> 04:24:25,030
Yeah, the bananas will kill you.

4773
04:24:26,630 --> 04:24:27,770
But, why?

4774
04:24:36,380 --> 04:24:39,500
Is that making my thing go down?

4775
04:24:40,080 --> 04:24:40,760
Yes it is.

4776
04:24:40,820 --> 04:24:41,040
What?

4777
04:24:41,120 --> 04:24:41,820
But it's delicious!

4778
04:24:42,860 --> 04:24:44,480
Have you guys never had...

4779
04:24:45,060 --> 04:24:48,480
Have you guys never had ravioli just straight from the can?

4780
04:24:48,640 --> 04:24:49,340
It's so good!

4781
04:24:51,220 --> 04:24:53,140
I want to read more book, please.

4782
04:24:54,340 --> 04:24:55,360
It's mysterious.

4783
04:24:58,840 --> 04:24:59,280
No?

4784
04:25:04,950 --> 04:25:07,490
Like the... Like a chef boyardee.

4785
04:25:07,830 --> 04:25:08,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4786
04:25:08,610 --> 04:25:09,190
You mean cold?

4787
04:25:09,310 --> 04:25:10,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4788
04:25:15,240 --> 04:25:17,520
But why is it making his energy go down?

4789
04:25:17,560 --> 04:25:18,460
Like it's so bad.

4790
04:25:19,220 --> 04:25:22,420
This guy is a... And our food didn't even go away.

4791
04:25:23,040 --> 04:25:24,360
Guy is such a drama queen.

4792
04:25:30,200 --> 04:25:32,460
Hand ravioli is great, but it's not raw.

4793
04:25:33,340 --> 04:25:34,280
Did I say it was raw?

4794
04:25:46,300 --> 04:25:46,820
Um...

4795
04:25:46,820 --> 04:25:49,480
Is it 10 bucks no matter which one you choose?

4796
04:25:51,740 --> 04:25:52,800
Oh, I said raw.

4797
04:25:52,960 --> 04:25:53,120
Oh.

4798
04:25:55,820 --> 04:25:57,440
Alright, we got a skill point.

4799
04:25:58,640 --> 04:26:00,100
I failed the great race.

4800
04:26:01,760 --> 04:26:03,260
We are good on gas.

4801
04:26:04,860 --> 04:26:06,120
Oh, black car.

4802
04:26:07,140 --> 04:26:08,100
Wait, urgent help.

4803
04:26:08,180 --> 04:26:10,020
No money for gas need gas.

4804
04:26:12,000 --> 04:26:12,560
R72.

4805
04:26:14,620 --> 04:26:15,800
Oh, no.

4806
04:26:16,800 --> 04:26:17,080
Sorry.

4807
04:26:17,800 --> 04:26:18,360
Sorry.

4808
04:26:19,240 --> 04:26:20,780
I have no charity work today.

4809
04:26:21,860 --> 04:26:22,420
R76.

4810
04:26:24,420 --> 04:26:25,180
Oh, no.

4811
04:26:25,380 --> 04:26:25,600
What?

4812
04:26:25,780 --> 04:26:28,020
You guys... Was my car not good enough for you before?

4813
04:26:34,210 --> 04:26:35,190
Where are we?

4814
04:26:36,010 --> 04:26:36,870
We are going here.

4815
04:26:37,150 --> 04:26:37,590
There we go.

4816
04:26:38,730 --> 04:26:39,570
Let's go.

4817
04:26:40,850 --> 04:26:41,790
A bit far.

4818
04:26:41,790 --> 04:26:43,170
We have enough money.

4819
04:26:43,270 --> 04:26:43,890
I think we are fine.

4820
04:26:45,210 --> 04:26:46,950
It was so good they want you to come back.

4821
04:26:48,530 --> 04:26:49,890
We are so close.

4822
04:26:51,750 --> 04:26:53,090
We can't fail.

4823
04:26:53,690 --> 04:26:54,750
We can't fail.

4824
04:26:55,130 --> 04:26:56,810
We are so close.

4825
04:27:03,730 --> 04:27:05,450
Have I unlocked all my available skills?

4826
04:27:06,030 --> 04:27:06,590
No.

4827
04:27:07,250 --> 04:27:08,170
Probably could.

4828
04:27:08,890 --> 04:27:10,630
You can't change skills while on the road.

4829
04:27:11,170 --> 04:27:12,410
Oh, I can't.

4830
04:27:15,670 --> 04:27:16,490
Something else?

4831
04:27:16,530 --> 04:27:17,230
Am I consumable?

4832
04:27:17,490 --> 04:27:18,310
Thank you.

4833
04:27:18,370 --> 04:27:19,910
We are going to... Not the journal.

4834
04:27:20,550 --> 04:27:21,890
We are going to put more... No!

4835
04:27:25,680 --> 04:27:27,740
I wanted to put a cigarette.

4836
04:27:32,560 --> 04:27:34,140
What is this?

4837
04:27:34,180 --> 04:27:35,140
This is so stupid.

4838
04:27:47,790 --> 04:27:49,030
I'm just going to use it.

4839
04:27:58,540 --> 04:27:58,920
Oh, wait.

4840
04:27:59,720 --> 04:28:00,000
Stop.

4841
04:28:08,180 --> 04:28:08,700
Nice.

4842
04:28:10,720 --> 04:28:11,500
My money.

4843
04:28:14,080 --> 04:28:15,380
I really like this song.

4844
04:28:15,440 --> 04:28:16,400
It's cute, right?

4845
04:28:17,380 --> 04:28:18,360
Very, very cute.

4846
04:28:20,980 --> 04:28:21,880
Oh, reliable.

4847
04:28:23,540 --> 04:28:24,900
Oh, reliable, baby.

4848
04:28:27,920 --> 04:28:32,740
Okay, now we can go into the trunk and we can move some stuff around.

4849
04:28:36,040 --> 04:28:36,640
Cigarette.

4850
04:28:40,460 --> 04:28:41,860
Oh, I forgot to sell these.

4851
04:28:42,120 --> 04:28:42,460
Oh, well.

4852
04:28:42,600 --> 04:28:43,360
I'll sell them next time.

4853
04:28:47,020 --> 04:28:47,380
Look!

4854
04:28:47,380 --> 04:28:48,280
You can see the ocean!

4855
04:28:52,440 --> 04:28:53,160
Construction area.

4856
04:28:53,260 --> 04:28:54,160
Oh, I think this one is new.

4857
04:28:57,780 --> 04:28:58,420
Oh, gosh.

4858
04:28:58,440 --> 04:28:59,600
This is like worst nightmare.

4859
04:29:00,800 --> 04:29:02,740
You get all those nails in your tires.

4860
04:29:09,460 --> 04:29:10,500
Let's do this, son.

4861
04:29:11,320 --> 04:29:11,920
Have a go.

4862
04:29:12,080 --> 04:29:12,580
Oh, reliable.

4863
04:29:12,880 --> 04:29:13,360
My favorite.

4864
04:29:13,900 --> 04:29:15,420
Oh, I should have used... It's okay.

4865
04:29:15,540 --> 04:29:17,160
The cigarettes are still there.

4866
04:29:18,820 --> 04:29:19,120
Yeah!

4867
04:29:31,160 --> 04:29:31,920
You know what?

4868
04:29:31,940 --> 04:29:32,680
I'm going to use this one.

4869
04:29:33,540 --> 04:29:36,320
You want to perfect with this skill and one gas.

4870
04:29:36,480 --> 04:29:38,280
Oh, we're not getting one gas.

4871
04:29:40,700 --> 04:29:41,020
Bandages?

4872
04:29:41,200 --> 04:29:41,280
Okay.

4873
04:29:41,400 --> 04:29:42,360
Oh, I guess I could have...

4874
04:29:42,360 --> 04:29:43,360
I could have like...

4875
04:29:44,360 --> 04:29:48,600
I always forget that the bandage doesn't make a... What's the word?

4876
04:29:49,000 --> 04:29:50,320
Doesn't use a turn.

4877
04:29:50,400 --> 04:29:50,900
You know what I mean?

4878
04:29:59,250 --> 04:30:02,130
Music in the game really gives the best vibes.

4879
04:30:02,270 --> 04:30:03,710
Wish the stereo upgrade didn't take up space.

4880
04:30:04,150 --> 04:30:04,350
Right!

4881
04:30:05,170 --> 04:30:08,210
I feel like... That was part of why I really wanted to play it though.

4882
04:30:08,990 --> 04:30:10,970
I was like, the music sounds so good in this.

4883
04:30:11,750 --> 04:30:13,530
And we are... Introspection.

4884
04:30:13,970 --> 04:30:15,850
No, we're behind a large truck.

4885
04:30:25,460 --> 04:30:27,200
And clear skies, yeah.

4886
04:30:27,880 --> 04:30:29,460
Nice and chill...

4887
04:30:32,900 --> 04:30:33,620
No...

4888
04:30:33,620 --> 04:30:34,860
That's so depressing.

4889
04:30:37,400 --> 04:30:39,460
But this one...

4890
04:30:40,060 --> 04:30:40,800
Nice!

4891
04:30:51,030 --> 04:30:52,030
There we go.

4892
04:30:54,930 --> 04:30:56,310
Increase following distance.

4893
04:30:56,590 --> 04:30:59,130
I know, why are we so close on his ass?

4894
04:30:59,730 --> 04:31:00,930
It makes me so nervous.

4895
04:31:04,230 --> 04:31:06,270
Like... I don't...

4896
04:31:06,270 --> 04:31:08,210
If he slams on the brakes...

4897
04:31:08,750 --> 04:31:10,190
This guy can't see us.

4898
04:31:10,850 --> 04:31:12,010
It's so over for us.

4899
04:31:15,460 --> 04:31:17,060
It's been so flooreded and all.

4900
04:31:17,140 --> 04:31:18,620
I have, I have floored it.

4901
04:31:19,480 --> 04:31:22,000
Yeah, I'm a certified...

4902
04:31:22,000 --> 04:31:22,940
Floorist.

4903
04:31:25,400 --> 04:31:26,400
Employment office.

4904
04:31:28,380 --> 04:31:30,200
Okay, we can repair.

4905
04:31:30,200 --> 04:31:30,780
Repair.

4906
04:31:32,820 --> 04:31:33,380
Repair.

4907
04:31:36,260 --> 04:31:36,820
39.

4908
04:31:38,680 --> 04:31:39,800
Shaming customers.

4909
04:31:40,920 --> 04:31:42,680
That should be worth...

4910
04:31:42,680 --> 04:31:45,620
That's, that's worth everything.

4911
04:31:47,080 --> 04:31:47,860
Remember to sell too.

4912
04:31:48,120 --> 04:31:48,520
Thank you.

4913
04:31:49,280 --> 04:31:50,540
Let's get rid of this.

4914
04:31:50,960 --> 04:31:52,460
Get rid of this.

4915
04:31:52,900 --> 04:31:54,520
And yes, we're getting rid of the liquor too.

4916
04:31:57,120 --> 04:31:58,760
We're getting rid of the liquor.

4917
04:32:05,440 --> 04:32:05,880
Hmm...

4918
04:32:07,700 --> 04:32:11,200
If I beat this with all my porn magazines...

4919
04:32:13,100 --> 04:32:15,120
It might be the best to ever do it.

4920
04:32:17,040 --> 04:32:18,600
We'll just do a budget repair.

4921
04:32:22,420 --> 04:32:23,420
Okay, that was good.

4922
04:32:25,120 --> 04:32:26,360
Yeah, that was good.

4923
04:32:28,740 --> 04:32:30,300
You should sell the food too.

4924
04:32:30,300 --> 04:32:32,220
Sell all my food.

4925
04:32:33,060 --> 04:32:33,740
I worked so hard.

4926
04:32:34,000 --> 04:32:35,840
Honestly, I don't really need much else.

4927
04:32:35,920 --> 04:32:36,520
We're almost there.

4928
04:32:37,700 --> 04:32:39,300
I could like, well...

4929
04:32:40,020 --> 04:32:41,340
We could get the amp.

4930
04:32:42,180 --> 04:32:43,200
For the party.

4931
04:32:44,020 --> 04:32:45,380
No more foie.

4932
04:32:45,500 --> 04:32:46,120
No more foie.

4933
04:32:46,180 --> 04:32:49,300
I thought the books would like at least give us like a...

4934
04:32:49,300 --> 04:32:52,300
Skill something or unlock something, but...

4935
04:32:53,800 --> 04:32:56,100
Cause the way it's implied, it says...

4936
04:32:56,100 --> 04:32:58,080
When the book is finished, you might feel something.

4937
04:32:58,080 --> 04:33:00,440
I thought we would get like a skill.

4938
04:33:01,320 --> 04:33:02,280
Get the tent.

4939
04:33:02,740 --> 04:33:03,660
I don't need it.

4940
04:33:05,740 --> 04:33:07,180
We're one city away.

4941
04:33:07,740 --> 04:33:09,960
In fact, I'm gonna get the amp and we're gonna have a great time.

4942
04:33:10,480 --> 04:33:11,300
Wait, how much is this?

4943
04:33:14,840 --> 04:33:17,760
I'm... I... I am the party!

4944
04:33:18,480 --> 04:33:19,980
I am the party!

4945
04:33:20,820 --> 04:33:24,620
I'm bringing eggs, I'm bringing trumpets, I'm bringing pizza, I'm bringing porn, I'm bringing...

4946
04:33:24,620 --> 04:33:26,440
I'm bringing all the essentials, baby!

4947
04:33:26,440 --> 04:33:26,560
Baby!

4948
04:33:29,200 --> 04:33:30,020
Here we go!

4949
04:33:31,200 --> 04:33:32,200
To the festival!

4950
04:33:33,980 --> 04:33:35,080
Oh, I am hungry.

4951
04:33:35,260 --> 04:33:35,720
You're right.

4952
04:33:38,680 --> 04:33:39,980
Pull over!

4953
04:33:41,280 --> 04:33:42,320
Eat banana.

4954
04:33:44,220 --> 04:33:45,580
I should have slept.

4955
04:34:04,950 --> 04:34:06,030
Exit the menu?

4956
04:34:07,070 --> 04:34:08,450
Oh wait, I will.

4957
04:34:08,450 --> 04:34:09,890
Exit the menu.

4958
04:34:12,210 --> 04:34:12,850
Continue.

4959
04:34:13,310 --> 04:34:14,030
It auto-saves.

4960
04:34:19,450 --> 04:34:20,190
Sleep.

4961
04:34:20,950 --> 04:34:21,170
E.P.

4962
04:34:21,290 --> 04:34:21,930
time!

4963
04:34:26,140 --> 04:34:29,100
All is well.

4964
04:34:31,040 --> 04:34:32,580
All is well.

4965
04:34:35,460 --> 04:34:36,460
Cowabunga.

4966
04:34:39,980 --> 04:34:40,700
Okay.

4967
04:34:45,960 --> 04:34:47,060
Here we go.

4968
04:34:47,420 --> 04:34:48,120
To the festival!

4969
04:34:49,240 --> 04:34:50,700
We've got this!

4970
04:34:53,700 --> 04:34:55,580
Use up my skill points.

4971
04:34:56,140 --> 04:34:56,740
I forgot.

4972
04:34:57,100 --> 04:34:57,320
Sorry.

4973
04:34:58,820 --> 04:34:59,360
Exit the menu!

4974
04:35:00,000 --> 04:35:00,800
No, just kidding.

4975
04:35:01,160 --> 04:35:01,460
It's okay.

4976
04:35:08,670 --> 04:35:10,750
Best plumbing... Flat tire!

4977
04:35:14,570 --> 04:35:15,850
I'm getting hungry.

4978
04:35:16,030 --> 04:35:17,570
This guy, all he does is eat.

4979
04:35:19,130 --> 04:35:20,230
What are you?

4980
04:35:20,370 --> 04:35:21,110
Human or something?

4981
04:35:25,860 --> 04:35:27,480
We can do either one.

4982
04:35:28,780 --> 04:35:29,500
Nice!

4983
04:35:33,260 --> 04:35:33,980
And...

4984
04:35:33,980 --> 04:35:34,860
No.

4985
04:35:36,480 --> 04:35:37,200
You.

4986
04:35:38,900 --> 04:35:39,620
Nice!

4987
04:35:39,620 --> 04:35:40,140
Let's do it!

4988
04:35:44,640 --> 04:35:46,680
Yeah, I'm a save scummer.

4989
04:35:46,980 --> 04:35:48,460
It wasn't my idea.

4990
04:35:49,040 --> 04:35:50,040
Someone told me to do it.

4991
04:35:50,400 --> 04:35:52,380
And I trust you guys and I listen to you guys.

4992
04:35:52,860 --> 04:35:53,840
Is that so wrong of me?

4993
04:35:54,700 --> 04:36:02,100
Is it so wrong of me to consider your inputs and say, Yeah, you know what, that's a good idea.

4994
04:36:02,100 --> 04:36:02,160
Yeah.

4995
04:36:10,120 --> 04:36:11,260
She loves us?

4996
04:36:11,400 --> 04:36:11,880
No, no, no.

4997
04:36:12,340 --> 04:36:16,060
Let's not, you know, get too hasty.

4998
04:36:18,160 --> 04:36:19,700
We're a bad influence.

4999
04:36:21,140 --> 04:36:22,920
We get this event a lot.

5000
04:36:23,060 --> 04:36:24,220
It's kind of boring at this point.

5001
04:36:26,140 --> 04:36:27,400
Get new material!

5002
04:36:43,990 --> 04:36:44,650
It's okay.

5003
04:36:45,410 --> 04:36:46,550
We have the armor.

5004
04:36:49,850 --> 04:36:51,510
I'm following the rules.

5005
04:36:54,750 --> 04:36:55,430
Nice!

5006
04:36:56,450 --> 04:36:57,710
And we get a gas.

5007
04:36:58,810 --> 04:37:00,010
We never have good ideas.

5008
04:37:01,910 --> 04:37:05,170
Sometimes you guys do, maybe.

5009
04:37:05,750 --> 04:37:06,850
The night falls.

5010
04:37:09,410 --> 04:37:10,990
Look at the ocean.

5011
04:37:13,110 --> 04:37:17,070
Why are kids playing at 10.15 at night on the highway?

5012
04:37:18,330 --> 04:37:21,550
These are ghost children.

5013
04:37:21,770 --> 04:37:22,630
What the hell?

5014
04:37:27,170 --> 04:37:29,750
Why are they here?

5015
04:37:36,400 --> 04:37:38,020
How do we wanna do this?

5016
04:37:41,910 --> 04:37:43,650
I wish I had put the gum in here.

5017
04:37:43,890 --> 04:37:44,350
Dang it.

5018
04:37:45,150 --> 04:37:46,790
I wish I had put the gum in here.

5019
04:37:47,410 --> 04:37:48,970
Wait, I'm gonna use this.

5020
04:37:50,010 --> 04:37:51,250
Wait, this one.

5021
04:37:51,510 --> 04:37:51,610
Yeah.

5022
04:37:52,710 --> 04:37:53,270
Here.

5023
04:37:54,930 --> 04:37:55,490
Crafty.

5024
04:37:56,810 --> 04:37:57,930
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

5025
04:37:59,630 --> 04:38:03,730
Because the gum gets... Yeah, the gum gets rid of two things.

5026
04:38:06,230 --> 04:38:07,070
It's okay.

5027
04:38:07,890 --> 04:38:09,070
I'll just do this.

5028
04:38:09,470 --> 04:38:10,450
And I'll do this.

5029
04:38:10,970 --> 04:38:12,710
And then we'll take the hit.

5030
04:38:13,570 --> 04:38:14,410
Take the hit.

5031
04:38:15,170 --> 04:38:16,670
But we're gonna get more gas.

5032
04:38:18,890 --> 04:38:20,530
Oh, now we get a music note.

5033
04:38:20,690 --> 04:38:21,350
Real nice.

5034
04:38:23,170 --> 04:38:23,910
See ya, kids.

5035
04:38:24,510 --> 04:38:25,370
Where are your parents?

5036
04:38:26,130 --> 04:38:28,150
For real though, where are your parents?

5037
04:38:29,550 --> 04:38:31,670
We're hungry, so we're going to...

5038
04:38:32,450 --> 04:38:34,670
In fact, since I said that, well...

5039
04:38:36,030 --> 04:38:37,090
We'll get rid of this one.

5040
04:38:38,230 --> 04:38:39,250
Switch it out for the gum.

5041
04:38:40,750 --> 04:38:41,430
Get the banana.

5042
04:38:43,870 --> 04:38:44,830
Get rid of the banana.

5043
04:38:45,760 --> 04:38:46,150
Okay.

5044
04:38:47,190 --> 04:38:48,770
We're bringing pizza to the party.

5045
04:38:49,250 --> 04:38:51,050
We're bringing snow to the party.

5046
04:38:51,870 --> 04:38:53,990
We're bringing a winter wonderland to the party.

5047
04:38:54,470 --> 04:38:56,390
We're bringing Christmas to the party.

5048
04:38:57,410 --> 04:38:59,750
We're bringing toons... Oh, my toons.

5049
04:39:03,030 --> 04:39:04,370
My toons!

5050
04:39:04,990 --> 04:39:07,070
We're bringing toons to the party.

5051
04:39:09,970 --> 04:39:10,750
Tigers!

5052
04:39:10,750 --> 04:39:11,050
Tigers!

5053
04:39:13,830 --> 04:39:15,550
We're bringing a dog to the party.

5054
04:39:15,710 --> 04:39:16,710
This is like the ultimate.

5055
04:39:16,890 --> 04:39:17,250
Look at this.

5056
04:39:17,890 --> 04:39:18,950
This is the ultimate.

5057
04:39:28,410 --> 04:39:29,950
When did I become a drug lord?

5058
04:39:30,610 --> 04:39:31,730
How did this happen?

5059
04:39:32,590 --> 04:39:34,490
You know, sometimes life is just so funny.

5060
04:39:36,250 --> 04:39:39,790
Sometimes you're on your way to a festival and sometimes...

5061
04:39:39,790 --> 04:39:41,430
You become a drug lord on the way.

5062
04:39:43,150 --> 04:39:46,220
What do you mean leave?

5063
04:39:46,240 --> 04:39:47,140
I just got here!

5064
04:39:49,120 --> 04:39:50,640
Come back in the morning?

5065
04:39:50,920 --> 04:39:51,540
Oh, my god.

5066
04:39:51,660 --> 04:39:52,140
No way.

5067
04:39:52,500 --> 04:39:53,860
I'm gonna sleep in my car.

5068
04:39:57,020 --> 04:39:58,900
Good morning, festival!

5069
04:40:02,300 --> 04:40:03,400
I'm not dirty.

5070
04:40:03,980 --> 04:40:04,820
I'm not dirty.

5071
04:40:06,660 --> 04:40:08,020
I'm squeaky clean.

5072
04:40:09,600 --> 04:40:10,520
I've got pizza.

5073
04:40:11,100 --> 04:40:12,880
Wait, I've got beans in my tummy.

5074
04:40:14,020 --> 04:40:14,960
I'm good.

5075
04:40:14,960 --> 04:40:20,240
This is gonna be the best night of my life!

5076
04:40:22,820 --> 04:40:24,700
Welcome to the Way Out East Festival.

5077
04:40:25,560 --> 04:40:26,760
May I see your ticket?

5078
04:40:27,140 --> 04:40:27,440
Perfect.

5079
04:40:27,720 --> 04:40:28,320
Have a blast!

5080
04:40:37,890 --> 04:40:38,260
All

5081
04:40:43,560 --> 04:40:45,320
the hippies are here!

5082
04:40:48,020 --> 04:40:48,760
Censor?

5083
04:40:50,080 --> 04:40:51,100
Is that my friend?

5084
04:40:51,100 --> 04:40:51,980
Hold on.

5085
04:40:52,100 --> 04:40:53,340
I have to see what else is around here.

5086
04:40:53,840 --> 04:40:54,960
We can leave the festival?

5087
04:40:55,120 --> 04:40:56,860
We can literally be like, nah, this is it.

5088
04:40:59,380 --> 04:41:00,520
You made it!

5089
04:41:01,880 --> 04:41:04,220
Park and let's set up your tent.

5090
04:41:06,720 --> 04:41:07,160
Festival!

5091
04:41:07,620 --> 04:41:08,720
Unlock ending festival!

5092
04:41:09,840 --> 04:41:11,560
The hour... I did not read pass.

5093
04:41:12,020 --> 04:41:13,200
The hours pass.

5094
04:41:13,360 --> 04:41:16,640
You drink, sing, dance and enjoy the few bands you were excited to see.

5095
04:41:16,640 --> 04:41:23,160
You are whirled from one scene to another, unaware of the passage of time, as you suddenly find yourself packing up your camp again.

5096
04:41:25,020 --> 04:41:28,240
The memories not yet formed last you a lifetime.

5097
04:41:29,300 --> 04:41:34,040
Developed into a kaleidoscope of sunshine, warm beer and constant noise.

5098
04:41:40,370 --> 04:41:46,700
I'm so young, young, young, young.

5099
04:41:47,180 --> 04:41:49,120
I'm so young, young, young, young.

5100
04:41:51,760 --> 04:41:52,960
Keep driving.

5101
04:41:53,200 --> 04:41:54,600
Unlock the new starting loadout.

5102
04:41:54,740 --> 04:41:55,520
Festival kit.

5103
04:42:00,670 --> 04:42:02,550
I'm so young, young, young, young.

5104
04:42:05,950 --> 04:42:08,330
Please don't talk to me while I... Wait.

5105
04:42:09,110 --> 04:42:10,430
Please don't talk to me.

5106
04:42:10,790 --> 04:42:12,290
I fall in love so easily.

5107
04:42:26,260 --> 04:42:27,480
What a title.

5108
04:42:27,880 --> 04:42:29,200
Light novel title reel.

5109
04:42:29,200 --> 04:42:31,140
By My Darling You.

5110
04:42:31,500 --> 04:42:32,260
Is that this song?

5111
04:42:32,820 --> 04:42:33,240
Oh yeah!

5112
04:42:36,500 --> 04:42:37,920
Please don't look at me.

5113
04:42:39,040 --> 04:42:40,380
This is so relatable.

5114
04:42:44,600 --> 04:42:45,800
Don't look at me.

5115
04:42:45,920 --> 04:42:46,800
Don't talk to me.

5116
04:42:46,960 --> 04:42:48,640
Don't even acknowledge me.

5117
04:42:49,000 --> 04:42:50,920
Don't ever say hi to me.

5118
04:42:51,160 --> 04:42:52,800
Don't even talk to me.

5119
04:42:53,220 --> 04:42:56,580
Don't ever look at me and try not to sniff me.

5120
04:42:56,580 --> 04:43:00,780
Don't ever even say hello to me.

5121
04:43:02,180 --> 04:43:05,200
If you play again, I hope you go for the mountain ending.

5122
04:43:05,280 --> 04:43:05,900
It's my favorite.

5123
04:43:06,060 --> 04:43:07,300
I've got mountain ending.

5124
04:43:20,360 --> 04:43:21,980
That was so fun.

5125
04:43:24,400 --> 04:43:26,060
I hope you guys liked it.

5126
04:43:28,300 --> 04:43:31,240
Maybe we can try for some of the other endings in the future.

5127
04:43:31,240 --> 04:43:33,120
Wait, hold on.

5128
04:43:46,760 --> 04:43:48,440
Hold on, something got messed up.

5129
04:43:48,620 --> 04:43:49,420
Oh, that's the game.

5130
04:43:51,660 --> 04:43:52,800
Hold on, something got messed up.

5131
04:43:56,220 --> 04:43:57,660
Takes one to know one.

5132
04:44:02,560 --> 04:44:03,400
Okay, good enough.

5133
04:44:03,400 --> 04:44:04,480
Thank you.

5134
04:44:08,560 --> 04:44:10,160
Late night Minto hits different.

5135
04:44:10,260 --> 04:44:10,680
Thanks so much.

5136
04:44:10,820 --> 04:44:14,460
This is such a good late night stream or game to stream.

5137
04:44:14,600 --> 04:44:15,400
No, like...

5138
04:44:16,980 --> 04:44:25,820
Just if it has those late night... I wish I had done a build that would allow more for the late night drive stuff.

5139
04:44:26,280 --> 04:44:27,640
I love taking night walks.

5140
04:44:29,000 --> 04:44:29,800
Thanks for the stream.

5141
04:44:29,940 --> 04:44:31,280
Been a while since I can watch start to finish.

5142
04:44:31,460 --> 04:44:32,260
Thank you!

5143
04:44:32,260 --> 04:44:36,540
Did you ever say why your name is now Daybrid instead of David?

5144
04:44:40,360 --> 04:44:41,940
Nice way to stay up for the eclipse.

5145
04:44:42,040 --> 04:44:42,560
You have!

5146
04:44:42,600 --> 04:44:43,740
You're gonna watch the eclipse.

5147
04:44:45,000 --> 04:44:46,040
Enjoy it.

5148
04:44:47,240 --> 04:44:50,340
Never thought driving around in a car full of illegal drugs would be so comfy.

5149
04:44:50,880 --> 04:44:53,540
I'm like the comfiest drug dealer ever, maybe.

5150
04:44:54,920 --> 04:44:55,820
Breaking bad?

5151
04:44:56,440 --> 04:44:57,260
No, breaking...

5152
04:45:03,150 --> 04:45:03,630
Happy.

5153
04:45:14,820 --> 04:45:15,620
Good one.

5154
04:45:19,080 --> 04:45:24,420
I was working on something for White Day, but like my Kamiyoshi, I'm always fashionably late.

5155
04:45:24,560 --> 04:45:26,740
I'm not fashionably late!

5156
04:45:27,220 --> 04:45:29,300
I was late today because I bought a car, okay?

5157
04:45:30,360 --> 04:45:32,780
Had a great time chilling with Minto and the Wisps tonight.

5158
04:45:33,080 --> 04:45:33,780
Thank you for the stream.

5159
04:45:33,900 --> 04:45:34,260
Thank you!

5160
04:45:34,320 --> 04:45:36,480
Whoa, Chidon-chan, I didn't even recognize you.

5161
04:45:37,860 --> 04:45:39,720
I didn't even recognize you!

5162
04:45:39,720 --> 04:45:41,700
Happy White Woman Day, Minto.

5163
04:45:41,820 --> 04:45:43,060
That's not what today is.

5164
04:45:44,580 --> 04:45:48,100
I just wanted to go back to Titanium without losing my peepee.

5165
04:45:49,060 --> 04:45:52,960
I think you wouldn't lose that so easily.

5166
04:45:57,880 --> 04:45:59,000
I think...

5167
04:46:01,460 --> 04:46:03,080
I think you're okay.

5168
04:46:03,380 --> 04:46:04,060
Breaking good?

5169
04:46:05,800 --> 04:46:06,360
Breaking...

5170
04:46:06,360 --> 04:46:06,620
Yeah.

5171
04:46:07,060 --> 04:46:07,960
No breaking.

5172
04:46:08,800 --> 04:46:10,160
We're chilling good.

5173
04:46:10,960 --> 04:46:12,020
Thanks for the fun stream.

5174
04:46:12,120 --> 04:46:14,920
Your stream of this convinced me to get the game and I had a blast.

5175
04:46:15,020 --> 04:46:15,240
Yay!

5176
04:46:15,940 --> 04:46:16,580
I'm glad.

5177
04:46:17,380 --> 04:46:19,300
Wow, thank you so much for the rose.

5178
04:46:19,780 --> 04:46:20,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

5179
04:46:22,200 --> 04:46:23,080
Detachable peepee.

5180
04:46:23,300 --> 04:46:25,180
Oh no, one zipper accident.

5181
04:46:26,280 --> 04:46:26,940
Is that real?

5182
04:46:28,520 --> 04:46:30,480
No, it's not that strong.

5183
04:46:30,480 --> 04:46:37,640
Maybe if you aggressively... If you were like the fastest ever to zip up your pants.

5184
04:46:38,100 --> 04:46:39,680
Kurisu, thank you for the membership.

5185
04:46:39,900 --> 04:46:40,240
Welcome.

5186
04:46:41,040 --> 04:46:43,740
You can... Oh wait, we need a third...

5187
04:46:43,740 --> 04:46:47,540
Keep driving stream so you can use the car's Minto art for the thumbnail.

5188
04:46:49,680 --> 04:46:51,180
Oh my gosh, Maple.

5189
04:46:53,560 --> 04:46:58,000
I love my car... Oh wait, I like my car like I like my women.

5190
04:46:58,260 --> 04:46:59,160
Optimus Prime.

5191
04:46:59,260 --> 04:46:59,840
So true.

5192
04:47:01,700 --> 04:47:03,520
You might need stitches.

5193
04:47:04,580 --> 04:47:05,900
Saitama zipping his pants.

5194
04:47:09,080 --> 04:47:11,040
Does that... It can get stuck?

5195
04:47:11,100 --> 04:47:12,200
I was gonna say, does it ever?

5196
04:47:14,280 --> 04:47:17,200
I think it would only get stuck if you don't wear underwear.

5197
04:47:18,400 --> 04:47:20,820
So, honestly, you're the problem.

5198
04:47:23,480 --> 04:47:24,600
You're the problem.

5199
04:47:25,700 --> 04:47:27,080
Always wear your underwear.

5200
04:47:29,240 --> 04:47:32,440
Thanks for the stream and thank you for all you do, Minto.

5201
04:47:32,620 --> 04:47:33,900
I'm happy to call you Mayoshi.

5202
04:47:34,640 --> 04:47:36,260
Thank you, Mr. Yumyum.

5203
04:47:38,120 --> 04:47:39,380
Such a cute name.

5204
04:47:39,820 --> 04:47:40,680
Mr. Yumyum.

5205
04:47:42,520 --> 04:47:43,000
Yumyumyumyum...

5206
04:47:48,120 --> 04:47:52,040
And don't talk to me and don't look at me.

5207
04:47:52,180 --> 04:47:55,880
And don't say hi to me and don't look at me.

5208
04:47:55,880 --> 04:47:59,840
And try not to sniff me and don't come my way.

5209
04:47:59,920 --> 04:48:04,480
And don't wave at me and don't ever say hi.

5210
04:48:04,840 --> 04:48:13,340
And don't acknowledge me and don't ever, ever, ever, ever...

5211
04:48:16,920 --> 04:48:19,480
Exist in my presence.

5212
04:48:20,600 --> 04:48:21,880
Next karaoke.

5213
04:48:22,840 --> 04:48:24,460
Murphy, thank you for the superchat.

5214
04:48:25,320 --> 04:48:27,000
Thanks for the fun stream while I was checking work.

5215
04:48:27,080 --> 04:48:28,580
Thank you, Cathy and Doug.

5216
04:48:28,620 --> 04:48:29,460
Good luck with work.

5217
04:48:30,000 --> 04:48:31,980
It was so fun to watch and now I have a nice soundtrack.

5218
04:48:32,160 --> 04:48:33,720
The songs though are so good, no?

5219
04:48:35,320 --> 04:48:37,240
Appreciate that the sniffing is only a try.

5220
04:48:40,320 --> 04:48:41,540
I'm glad you noticed.

5221
04:48:42,480 --> 04:48:47,340
Zipper on the crotch feels like someone... Oh my gosh, I don't wanna... Don't describe it.

5222
04:48:48,760 --> 04:48:50,900
Sometimes I get stuck on the hot dog.

5223
04:48:51,420 --> 04:48:53,140
That's not a hot dog moment.

5224
04:48:54,920 --> 04:48:56,100
They were all original?

5225
04:48:56,340 --> 04:48:56,740
The songs?

5226
04:48:56,880 --> 04:48:57,300
No, no.

5227
04:48:57,480 --> 04:48:58,040
I don't think so.

5228
04:48:58,120 --> 04:48:59,760
I think they were all...

5229
04:48:59,760 --> 04:49:01,260
Like indie bands though.

5230
04:49:02,620 --> 04:49:04,480
So, sniff a try.

5231
04:49:04,840 --> 04:49:05,280
Did you?

5232
04:49:05,320 --> 04:49:06,060
Did you, Junna?

5233
04:49:06,780 --> 04:49:07,360
Did you?

5234
04:49:11,020 --> 04:49:12,680
Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now.

5235
04:49:13,000 --> 04:49:13,780
Thank you guys!

5236
04:49:13,980 --> 04:49:18,060
Thank you guys for keep driving and I hope you had fun and sorry I was late.

5237
04:49:19,520 --> 04:49:22,060
But... If you're watching the VOD then it doesn't really matter.

5238
04:49:22,160 --> 04:49:24,900
But I definitely did not expect to stream until 1 AM my time.

5239
04:49:26,380 --> 04:49:27,020
So...

5240
04:49:27,020 --> 04:49:27,620
Yeah.

5241
04:49:28,800 --> 04:49:31,860
Tomorrow is Devil May Cry 4.

5242
04:49:33,780 --> 04:49:34,420
And...

5243
04:49:34,420 --> 04:49:36,480
What time am I streaming on?

5244
04:49:40,780 --> 04:49:41,620
I check?

5245
04:49:43,700 --> 04:49:45,220
I'm checking, I'm checking.

5246
04:49:45,820 --> 04:49:47,480
I'm checking, I'm checking, I'm checking.

5247
04:49:48,140 --> 04:49:50,440
I'm streaming at...

5248
04:49:50,440 --> 04:49:51,560
6 PM.

5249
04:49:53,700 --> 04:49:54,120
Really?

5250
04:49:54,840 --> 04:49:55,740
Oh yeah, 6 PM.

5251
04:49:56,940 --> 04:49:57,420
Okay.

5252
04:49:58,800 --> 04:49:59,280
Otsumito!

5253
04:50:00,120 --> 04:50:01,200
6 PM my time.

5254
04:50:02,720 --> 04:50:03,200
Otsumito!

5255
04:50:03,400 --> 04:50:03,660
Otsumito!

5256
04:50:03,780 --> 04:50:04,100
Otsumito!

5257
04:50:04,280 --> 04:50:04,760
Otsumito!

5258
04:50:04,940 --> 04:50:05,220
Otsumito!

5259
04:50:05,320 --> 04:50:05,700
Otsumito!

5260
04:50:05,760 --> 04:50:06,120
Otsumito!

5261
04:50:06,280 --> 04:50:06,720
Otsumito!

5262
04:50:07,740 --> 04:50:08,220
Itterasshai!

5263
04:50:08,720 --> 04:50:09,380
Thank you everybody!

5264
04:50:10,100 --> 04:50:10,540
Bye bye!

5265
04:50:10,980 --> 04:50:11,400
Bye bye!

5266
04:50:11,540 --> 04:50:11,920
Bye bye!

5267
04:50:32,000 --> 04:50:33,200
I forgot to say.

5268
04:50:33,440 --> 04:50:36,720
I want to say also thank you guys for all the encouragement about my car.

5269
04:50:38,120 --> 04:50:38,740
Thank you.

5270
04:50:39,140 --> 04:50:40,320
I was really scared.

5271
04:50:40,420 --> 04:50:41,060
I was really nervous.

5272
04:50:42,060 --> 04:50:46,460
Especially because it was scary going to a car dealership.

5273
04:50:47,880 --> 04:50:49,160
So thank you!

5274
04:50:50,720 --> 04:50:52,140
Good job being brave.

5275
04:50:52,200 --> 04:50:53,080
Thank you!

5276
04:50:53,480 --> 04:50:54,540
Thank you!

5277
04:50:55,100 --> 04:50:57,440
Thanks for when I said...

5278
04:50:57,440 --> 04:50:58,740
When I said...

5279
04:50:58,740 --> 04:51:01,060
Say that you...

5280
04:51:01,860 --> 04:51:04,140
When I said no to...

5281
04:51:04,140 --> 04:51:04,940
Not compliment.

5282
04:51:06,200 --> 04:51:07,340
When I...

5283
04:51:07,340 --> 04:51:08,780
When I was like...

5284
04:51:08,780 --> 04:51:11,780
For some reason I can only think of the Japanese...

5285
04:51:14,200 --> 04:51:16,480
Because I did a good job and you guys did.

5286
04:51:17,220 --> 04:51:17,680
Thank you!
